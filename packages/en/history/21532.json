Several predecessors in this field have done\r\ntheir work so well that another book entirely historical in character\r\nmight seem superfluous. Rather it is the aim of this volume to furnish a\r\nsurvey--sketching broadly the development of the University, and\r\ndwelling upon incidents and personalities that contribute movement to\r\nthe narrative.\r\n\r\nThose familiar with the history of the University will recognize the\r\nsources of much that appears in the following pages. The author must\r\nacknowledge an especial debt to Professor Ten Brook's \"History of State\r\nUniversities,\" and the two histories of the University, written by\r\nElizabeth Farrand, '87_m_, and Professor Burke E. Hinsdale. Much of the\r\nmaterial in the early chapters is based directly upon Professor\r\nHinsdale's painstaking and authoritative work. Other works which have\r\nbeen consulted are Judge Cooley's \"History of Michigan,\" Professor C.K.\r\nAdams' \"Historical Sketch,\" published by the University in 1876,\r\nProfessor A.C. McLaughlin's \"History of Higher Education in Michigan\"\r\n(Contributions to American Educational History, Number II, Bureau of\r\nEducation, 1891), the reports of the Fiftieth and Seventy-fifth\r\nAnniversaries and Dr. Angell's Quarter Centennial Celebration, and Dr.\r\nAngell's \"Reminiscences.\" The files of _The Michigan Alumnus_ and the\r\n_Michiganensian_, the records of the Regents' meetings and the calendars\r\nof the University have likewise proved extremely valuable. For the\r\nmaterial in certain chapters, \"The Michigan Book,\" published in 1898, by\r\nEdwin H. Humphrey, '97, an article entitled \"The University of Michigan\r\nand the Training of Her Students for the War,\" by Professor Arthur L.\r\nCross, in the _Michigan History Magazine_, for January, 1920, and Andrew\r\nD. White's \"Autobiography\" have been freely consulted.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that our information concerning the earliest days of\r\nthe University is comparatively meager. The collections of old\r\nnewspapers and other original sources in the University Library have\r\nbeen utilized, but these are not as extensive as they should be.\r\nUndoubtedly not a little material in the form of letters and diaries is\r\nstill to be found among the papers of the earliest officers of the\r\nUniversity and the graduates of the '40's and '50's. The writer would\r\nappreciate any information regarding such documents.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgment is also due to the many friends who have offered\r\nsuggestions and helpful criticism. Especially is grateful recognition\r\ndue to Professor F.N. Scott, Judge V.H. Lane, President Emeritus Harry\r\nB. Hutchins, Dr. G. Carl Huber, Dean John R. Effinger, Professor Evans\r\nHolbrook, Professor Arthur L. Cross and the late Professor Isaac N.\r\nDemmon; their encouragement and counsel have been invaluable.\r\n\r\nAn apparent inconsistency in references to the major divisions of the\r\nUniversity may be noted by some readers. These are sometimes referred to\r\nas \"Departments\" and sometimes as \"Schools\" or \"Colleges,\" as the case\r\nmay be. This arises from the fact that the official nomenclature was\r\nchanged about ten years ago. In general the author has referred to these\r\ndivisions as \"Departments\" in discussing the period before 1910.\r\n\r\nW.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                                   PAGE\r\n\r\n    I INTRODUCTION                                           1\r\n\r\n   II THE FOUNDATION OF THE UNIVERSITY                       7\r\n\r\n  III THE UNIVERSITY'S EARLY DAYS                           23\r\n\r\n   IV THE FIRST ADMINISTRATIONS                             45\r\n\r\n    V PRESIDENT ANGELL AND PRESIDENT HUTCHINS               64\r\n\r\n   VI LITERATURE, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS                     91\r\n\r\n  VII THE PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES                121\r\n\r\n VIII A STATE UNIVERSITY AS A CENTER OF LEARNING           145\r\n\r\n   IX STUDENT LIFE                                         172\r\n\r\n    X FRATERNITIES AND STUDENT ACTIVITIES                  207\r\n\r\n   XI ATHLETICS                                            233\r\n\r\n  XII TOWN AND CAMPUS                                      268\r\n\r\n XIII THE UNIVERSITY IN WAR TIMES                          298\r\n\r\n  XIV THE ALUMNI OF THE UNIVERSITY                         324\r\n\r\n      TABLES                                               351\r\n\r\n      INDEX                                                359\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n                                                                 FACING\r\n                                                                   PAGE\r\n\r\n  UNIVERSITY HALL.

The interest of the loiterers at the\r\ncountry tavern and the corner grocery was no doubt aroused by their\r\ncoming, for Ann Arbor we may suppose was not different from other small\r\nplaces; and this curiosity could hardly have been lessened by the fact\r\nthat the newcomers were all men who figured prominently in the affairs\r\nof the State, which had been admitted to the Union only four months\r\nbefore. Whatever the speculation aroused by the personnel of the party,\r\nhowever, the business that called them to Ann Arbor caused little\r\ncomment, if we are to judge from contemporary reports. Yet this\r\nunpretentious gathering of notables was charged with the inauguration of\r\nwhat was to become one of the most significant developments in the\r\nhistory of American education,--the establishment and successful\r\nmaintenance of a University by the people of a State.\r\n\r\nThus met for their first session the Regents of the future University of\r\nMichigan. Unfortunately we do not know the particulars of this meeting;\r\nnot even in what country lawyer's office or public hall it was held;\r\nstill less are we able to profit from any of the illuminating details or\r\npersonal comments a modern observer would have given us. Our knowledge\r\nof the character of the men, and the official report of what they did,\r\nis all we have to reveal the spirit in which they set themselves to\r\ntheir task.\r\n\r\nOf the nineteen members of the Board at that time eleven were present at\r\nthis first session, which lasted three days. Included among the number,\r\nas ex-officio members, were the boy Governor of the State, Stevens T.\r\nMason, then only twenty-five years old, the Lieutenant-Governor, Edward\r\nMundy, and the Chancellor of the State, Elon Farnsworth; while among the\r\nmembers by appointment were Michigan's first Congressman and author of\r\nthe law under which the University was to be organized, General Isaac E.\r\nCrary, and two well-known Detroit physicians, Dr. Zina Pitcher,\r\nafterward to be known as the founder of the Medical School, and Dr.\r\nSamuel Denton, destined to be a professor in the same Department.\r\n\r\nTheir first action was the appointment of a committee to select the\r\nforty acres offered as an inducement to bring the University to Ann\r\nArbor. Measures were then taken for the organization of the institution;\r\nthe Legislature was petitioned to give the Board the power to appoint a\r\nChancellor; four professorships were established until more were needed;\r\nsalaries were limited to not less than $1,200 or more than $2,000; and a\r\nLibrarian was appointed for a library not yet in existence.\r\n\r\nThus the University began its career. The men who were responsible for\r\nit in its early years were, for the most part, lawyers and politicians,\r\nlacking even the actual experience in educational matters which the\r\nclergymen of that time were supposed to have; but there is evidence of\r\nan idealism and confidence in the future on their part which must\r\nexplain the eventual success of the University,--a vision which enabled\r\nit to become the model for all succeeding state institutions.\r\n\r\nThe task before this Board and its immediate successors was not an easy\r\none. They saw, in their mind's eye, a university with thousands of\r\nstudents, forming the cap-stone of a great educational system which was\r\nto rest on the little log schoolhouses which were so rapidly rising in\r\nthe wilderness about them. Their immediate resources, however, proved\r\nalmost ridiculously inadequate, while their best efforts were often\r\nnullified by the selfishness and lack of foresight of many of their\r\ncontemporaries. Land set aside for the University by the Government was\r\nsold for a song to satisfy speculators. An elaborate building program\r\nhad, perforce, to be abandoned and even the simple buildings erected\r\nwere criticized as extravagant. The Faculty was far from being a\r\nharmonious little family, and dissensions arose between the students and\r\nteachers over the establishment of fraternities; while the jealousy of\r\nrival religious denominations and the lack of a strong executive\r\nmultiplied the difficulties which made the first years of the University\r\nfar from happy.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the University came through it all, not unscathed, but\r\nsufficiently strong and vigorous, and with great possibilities for the\r\nfuture in the rising fortunes of the Commonwealth, which gradually came\r\nto take a great pride in this child of its first years. To the State, no\r\nless than to the Regents and Faculty, belongs the credit of Michigan's\r\ngreat achievement in American educational history,--the first proof that\r\na university, maintained by the people of a state as part of its\r\neducational system, could be made a practical success.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a state university, or rather a state educational system,\r\nwas not in itself strikingly new; in fact two interesting experiments in\r\nDetroit had preceded the University. But none of the original thirteen\r\ncolonies, or the new states so rapidly being carved out of the lands\r\nbrought in by the addition of the Northwest Territory, had been able to\r\nmake really practical that provision in the Ordinance of 1787 which,\r\nfrom its place above the stage in University Hall, has sunk into the\r\nconsciousness of so many student generations of the University of\r\nMichigan.\r\n\r\n     Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good\r\n     government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of\r\n     education shall forever be encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe actual success of the University was Michigan's first great\r\ncontribution to the Nation. The inauguration of practical laboratory\r\nwork in science, as well as the speedy organization of Medical and\r\nEngineering Departments, was the second step. This led to a new\r\nrelationship between education and practical life; others besides\r\ncandidates for the ministry began to come in greater numbers to seek\r\ndegrees. Hardly less revolutionary in the third place was Dr. Tappan's\r\neffort to make Michigan a real University,--the introduction of true\r\ngraduate study which, though not immediately successful, made Michigan\r\nonce more a pioneer among American schools. Again, the establishment of\r\nthe chemical laboratory, the introduction of co-education, and the\r\ncreation of a Department of Education, bringing with it a correlation of\r\nthe University with the high schools of the State, are all matters now\r\nso generally taken for granted that it is somewhat difficult nowadays to\r\ngive the University proper credit for leading the way.\r\n\r\nIn recent years other state universities have overtaken Michigan in\r\ntheir development. Some states are supporting their universities even\r\nmore liberally than Michigan. Many have gone so far as to do away with\r\nstudent fees, an item which has a large place in Michigan's annual\r\nincome. Whether this is entirely desirable is perhaps a question. One of\r\nthe University's greatest assets is the interest and support of her\r\nformer students. They have shown less of the spirit which is more or\r\nless inevitable in all state institutions,--a feeling that once they\r\nhave received their educational bargain, their responsibility to the\r\ninstitution ceases. The loyalty of Michigan's alumni body may arise in\r\nsome part from the very fact that the education given has not been\r\nentirely free, as well as through a justifiable pride in the prestige\r\nand academic traditions which the years have brought.\r\n\r\nOther universities also have developed further means of maintaining\r\nfriendly relations with the people of their states, through affiliating\r\nthe state agricultural colleges with the university and offering\r\nelaborate programs of extension courses. In this direction Michigan has\r\nmade haste slowly, for there is danger to true academic ideals in such a\r\ncourse. The result has been that there is no instruction given in the\r\nUniversity that cannot be considered of proper academic character under\r\npresent-day standards.\r\n\r\nOur university system has progressed so far and so fast, however, that\r\nthe educators of the first half of the nineteenth century would find\r\nlittle they could recognize in the wide range of human knowledge\r\nincluded in our modern university curricula. When the University was\r\nfounded, the schools of America were really closer to the great\r\nuniversities of the Middle Ages than to those of the present day. The\r\ncomparatively brief period covered by the life of the University of\r\nMichigan has seen a greater change in educational ideals and practices\r\nthan anything which took place during the preceding thousand years, for\r\nwe have added to their heritage all the great developments of the past\r\ncentury in science and the arts.\r\n\r\nMichigan has done her part in this transition from the old to the new;\r\nand in carrying on her work she has acquired a life of her own, an\r\nacademic atmosphere, and a characteristic student life which have a\r\npeculiar interest to all Michigan men and women. To chronicle in brief\r\nthe main events in Michigan's history; to suggest their significance; to\r\npicture the life of the students and Faculties; and to set forth the\r\nUniversity's real measure of success, in order that all who are\r\ninterested in the University may know her and understand her ideals and\r\ntraditions, is the aim of the following chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDATION OF THE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the University of Michigan might properly be said to\r\nbegin in 1817. It is true that the University seal proclaims 1837 as the\r\nyear of its birth, but the present institution is only a successor of\r\ntwo previous incarnations in Detroit, which were its direct\r\npredecessors. The State Supreme Court, in fact, held in 1856 that the\r\ncorporate existence of the University began with the Act of the 26th of\r\nAugust, 1817, and has been continuous throughout all the subsequent\r\nchanges of the organic law.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult, however, to recognize the present University in\r\nthat curiosity of educational history established by the Act of 1817\r\nunder the sonorous title of the \"Catholepistemiad, or University of\r\nMichigania.\" This institution, in effect designed to be a university,\r\nwas to be composed of thirteen _didaxiim_, or professorships, of such\r\nbranches as _Catholepistemia_ or Universal Science, _Anthropoglossica_\r\nor Literature, _Physiosophica_ or Natural Philosophy, _Polemitactica_ or\r\nMilitary Science, and _Ennoeica_ or Intellectual Sciences, which\r\nembraced all the _Epistimiim_ or \"Sciences relative to the minds of\r\nanimals, to the human mind, to spiritual existences, to the Deity, and\r\nto religion.\" It is worthy of note also that Chemistry, Medicine, and\r\nPolitical Economy were provided for under the names of _Chymia_,\r\n_Iatrica_, and _Oeconomica_. This scheme, which was prepared by\r\nAugustus B. Woodward, Presiding Judge of the territorial Supreme Court,\r\nwent further than this provision for the University, however, for it\r\ncontemplated as well a complete state educational system, with\r\nsubordinate colleges, academies, schools, libraries, museums, athenaeums,\r\nbotanical gardens, laboratories and \"other useful literary and\r\nscientific Institutions consonant with the laws of the United States and\r\nof Michigan.\" These the President and the Didactors were to provide for,\r\nas well as for Directors, Visitors, Curators, Librarians, Instructors\r\nand \"Instructrixes\" throughout the various counties, cities, towns,\r\ntownships, or other geographical divisions of Michigan.\r\n\r\nTo support this grand scheme, the public taxes were to be increased\r\nfifteen percent, and a provision, which seems strangely unacademic to\r\nthe college community of a century later, was made for four successive\r\nlotteries from which the Catholepistemiad might retain fifteen percent\r\nof the prizes for its own use. Two of these lotteries apparently were\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\nThe institution which arose in the shade of this immense growth of\r\npseudo-classical verbiage was a very modest undertaking indeed and\r\ndeveloped little beyond the primary school and classical academy first\r\nestablished. These were housed in a little building in Detroit,\r\ntwenty-four by fifty feet, on the west side of Bates Street near\r\nCongress, afterward occupied by one of the branches of the University.\r\nScarcely more ambitious was the faculty of two men, the Rev. John\r\nMonteith, a Presbyterian clergyman who was President and seven-fold\r\n_didactor_, and Father Gabriel Richard, a Catholic priest who was\r\nVice-President and incumbent of the other six _didaxiim_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CATHOLEPISTEMIAD, OR UNIVERSITY, OF MICHIGANIA\r\nA photograph of the original outline in Judge Woodward's handwriting;\r\nnow in the University Library]\r\n\r\nAbsurd as was the terminology and ridiculous as were its vast\r\npretensions in view of the little French-Canadian community it served,\r\nnevertheless, the educational scheme which the act outlined was of\r\ngreat significance in the future development of education in the State.\r\nIt was one of the first plans in America for a complete educational\r\nprogram to be supported by the people of a state.[1] Its sources were to\r\nbe found, undoubtedly, in the strong influence of French thought on\r\ncontemporary American life, for this scheme was but a copy of the highly\r\ncentralized organization of state instruction which Napoleon gave to\r\nFrance in the Imperial University of 1806-08. As Professor Hinsdale\r\nsays, \"the ponderous name belonged to organized public education.\" Four\r\nyears later, another act established in Detroit \"an University for the\r\npurpose of educating youth\" as the successor of the Catholepistemiad,\r\nwith little change in the broad and liberal outline of the plan save in\r\ntwo particulars,--a change from classical to English nomenclature and\r\nthe substitution of a Board of Trustees for the self-governing President\r\nand Didactors of the earlier scheme.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: No one of the old states had what we would now call a State\r\nUniversity, although two or three states had institutions that bore that\r\nname, while several of the states had voted money or wild lands to\r\npromote higher education; nor had any of the new states, aided by the\r\nbounty of Congress, established such an institution that was worthy of\r\nthe name, University.--Hinsdale, _History of the University of\r\nMichigan_, p. 16.]\r\n\r\nMichigan at this time was on the far edge of civilization; it was not\r\neven organized as a territory until the year 1805. In 1800 the total\r\npopulation was only 3,757, while in 1817 it could not have been more\r\nthan 7,000. The inhabitants of Detroit only numbered 1,442 in 1820.\r\nAside from the Indians, who for many years were to be a not\r\ninconsiderable portion of the population, the early inhabitants were all\r\nFrench settlers whose main business was fur trading. With the first\r\nyears of the nineteenth century, however, there came a constantly\r\nincreasing stream of \"Bostonians,\" as the men from the East were called.\r\nThey were not welcomed at first, although their enterprise and\r\neducation were to transform Michigan within a surprisingly short period\r\ninto one of the most progressive of the new states. Nevertheless this\r\ngrowth was at first slow and it was not until Michigan became a state in\r\n1837 that the rapid increase in settlers from New York and New England\r\nchanged so completely the character of the people that it became in a\r\nfew years a predominantly agricultural, instead of a primitive\r\nfur-trading community. The rapidity of this movement towards the West,\r\nonce begun, was most fortunate, as the settlers from the older states in\r\nthe East were enabled to put into effect immediately their own training\r\nin the schools of New York and New England for the benefit of their\r\nchildren. This is one of the underlying causes of Michigan's success;\r\nwhereas other states, whose settlement began earlier, failed through the\r\nlowering of the standards of education inevitable in the hard life of\r\nthe generation succeeding the first pioneers.\r\n\r\nThe initial public support of education in Michigan, as in all of the\r\nnew states west of the Alleghenies, came from the important provision\r\nmade by the Federal Government in 1785 for a system of surveys of the\r\npublic lands. These had eventually been deeded to the Government by the\r\ndifferent states as the only practicable settlement of conflicting\r\nclaims which at one time promised to disrupt the new confederation.\r\nTheir acquisition by the nation and their eventual division and\r\nadmission to the Union as states contributed not a little to the\r\nstrengthening of the central authority at a time when it was a vital\r\nnecessity. The first survey of these lands provided, as is well known,\r\nfor division into townships six miles square, to be again sub-divided\r\ninto thirty-six lots one mile square called sections. The provision of\r\nthis ordinance of particular interest in this connection is the\r\nfollowing: \"There shall be reserved the lot Number 16 of every township\r\nfor the maintenance of public schools within the said township.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Ordinance of 1787, providing for the administration of the\r\nNorthwest Territory, we have only the familiar general declaration that:\r\n\"Schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged,\" but an\r\nordinance adopted ten days later provided that in addition to the school\r\nlot in every township: \"Not more than two complete townships are to be\r\ngiven perpetually for the purposes of a University, to be laid off by\r\nthe purchaser or purchasers as near the center as may be, so that the\r\nsame shall be of good land to be applied to the intended object by the\r\nLegislature of the State.\" This was the fundamental action which made\r\npossible the foundation of the University of Michigan almost at the same\r\ntime that the State was admitted to the Union.\r\n\r\nFor the most part the story of the land grants under this provision is\r\nan unfortunate one of speculation, misappropriations, and sale by venal\r\nLegislatures, whose only excuse was probably their inexperience and lack\r\nof vision; and the natural desire of the people to benefit at once from\r\nthe endowment these lands represented. Michigan had her troubles in\r\ncommon with the other new states, but she did manage to acquire enough\r\nfrom these lands eventually to give the University needed support in her\r\nvery lean early years. Their history, therefore, is not without\r\ninterest. When Indiana territory was divided by Congress in 1804 into\r\nthe three districts corresponding to the present states of Indiana,\r\nIllinois, and Michigan, one township was reserved in each for a seminary\r\nof learning. This, in Michigan, was increased in 1826 to two townships,\r\nwhich might be located by sections in any of the districts surveyed.\r\nEven more important was a measure approved by Congress in 1836 which\r\npermitted the State to control the selection, administration, and even\r\neventual sale of these sections with no reference to the limits of the\r\nCongressional townships, thus permitting their consolidation into one\r\nstate fund. This precedent has been followed by all the states entering\r\nthe Union since 1837.\r\n\r\nThe plan of making a state trust of the public lands was a good one--on\r\npaper. But with the rapidly growing population, envious eyes were soon\r\ncast on these tracts by immigrants, many of whom settled on these\r\nsections as squatters, to make endless trouble in the future with their\r\nconflicting claims. The first lands definitely set aside were selected\r\nby the Trustees of the old University of Detroit in 1827 within the\r\nlimits of what is now the city of Toledo. The selection could not have\r\nbeen better, consisting in all of some 960 acres, but most unfortunately\r\nthe best part was exchanged in 1830, on the representation of\r\nland-sharks, for poorer land and the land thus received was sold four\r\nyears later for $5,000. The remainder was disposed of fifteen years\r\nlater for about $19 an acre, bringing to the University a total of some\r\n$17,000 for land which eventually came to be worth, literally, millions.\r\nMeanwhile other tracts were being located in all the counties of the\r\nState then organized. Soon after Michigan became a state, the\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction made an inventory of these which\r\nshowed that at $15 an acre they would bring a fund of $691,200 and an\r\nannual income to the University of $48,384. At $20, which he thought\r\nmight easily represent their value, they would bring an annual income of\r\n$64,912. The first sale justified his optimism, as the price averaged\r\n$22.85 an acre, though only one-fourth of the purchase money was paid\r\nin cash. But the people of the State soon began to murmur; they were not\r\ninterested in continuing these big reservations of choice land for an\r\nobject so remote as a university. The Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction, moreover, found himself involved in all kinds of trouble\r\nwith the purchasers. The matter finally came up to the Legislature under\r\nthe guise of a bill for the relief of certain settlers on university and\r\nother state lands, which would have thrown these sections on the market\r\nat a nominal price and insured the squatters permanent tenure. The bill\r\nwas a short-sighted and vicious one and was promptly vetoed by the young\r\nGovernor, Stevens T. Mason, because he felt these lands were given to\r\nthe State as a sacred trust. In this courageous action he performed one\r\nof the greatest of his many services to the University.\r\n\r\nBut the Legislature had a different idea as to the sacredness of the\r\ntrust. Various measures were passed, lengthening the time of deferred\r\npayment, successively lowering the minimum price at which the lands were\r\nto be sold and eventually in 1841 making the minimum price of $12\r\nretroactive. Under this measure, $35,651 were actually returned or\r\ncredited to purchasers. When the lands were all sold the average price\r\nrealized was not quite $12 an acre, resulting in a fund of some $547,000\r\nfrom which the University now derives an annual income of $38,433.44.\r\nWhile this amount is by no means as large as was hoped for in those\r\nearly days, this income, if it had been available in the first years,\r\nwould have helped the struggling institution materially.\r\n\r\nTo most of us this dissipation of what might have been, with more\r\ncareful and conservative management, a magnificent endowment seems\r\nalmost a tragedy. But there is another side. Michigan was far more\r\nfortunate in her disposal of these public lands than any of her\r\ncontemporaries and obtained more than twice the amount realized from any\r\nother state lands in the Northwest. For example, Wisconsin only realized\r\n$150,000 from her 72 sections, while others fared worse instead of\r\nbetter. Michigan is regarded in this respect as a model, instead of a\r\nhorrible example. Then, too, the early sale of the land was imperative\r\nif the University was to live. The income from this source was almost\r\nits sole support except the exceedingly slender student fees. We must\r\nconclude, therefore, that the Government grants performed their\r\nfunction; thanks to them we still have a University and still receive a\r\nrespectable income from the fund which represents their sale.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution prepared for the prospective State by the Convention of\r\n1835 provided for a University and authorized its immediate\r\nestablishment upon the adoption of the Constitution. This provision was\r\nthe result of the joint labors of two men whose memory will always be\r\nheld in honor by the University;--John D. Pierce, a graduate of Brown\r\nUniversity and a missionary in the service of the Presbyterian Church,\r\nwho was then about forty years old, and General Isaac Edwin Crary, a\r\ngraduate of Trinity College, Connecticut (1827), who, with his bride,\r\nmade his home with Pierce in the tiny backwoods settlement of Marshall.\r\nThey were both men of unusual caliber and were interested vitally in the\r\naffairs of the territory, particularly educational questions. Many are\r\nthe discussions these two must have held, to which a stray copy of a\r\ntranslation of M. Victor Cousin's report on \"The State of Public\r\nInstruction in Prussia,\" made to the French ministry of Public\r\nInstruction, which fell into the hands of Pierce, certainly contributed\r\nnot a little. Here was the account of a state system of public\r\ninstruction which was under successful operation. These men were\r\nfamiliar with the previous experiments in the Michigan of territorial\r\ndays and with the efforts in other states in this direction, but nowhere\r\ncould they find the practical help they needed. The few colleges in the\r\ncountry were practically all privately endowed institutions, having no\r\norganic connection with the secondary schools, to say nothing of the\r\nrare public high schools. Thus the orderly and consistent development of\r\na state school system in Prussia had a peculiar appeal to these pioneers\r\nwho were already considering the outline of the educational system in\r\nthe State of Michigan to be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUR FOUNDERS OF THE UNIVERSITY\r\n  (From paintings)\r\n  Stevens T. Mason (1812-1843)\r\n  John D. Pierce (1797-1882)\r\n  Zina Pitcher (1797-1872)\r\n  Samuel Denton (1803-1860)]\r\n\r\nGeneral Crary became the chairman of the Committee on Education in the\r\nConstitutional Convention and upon him devolved the immediate task of\r\ndrafting the educational article. He had, no doubt, Cousin's report at\r\nhand as well as the advantage of the advice of Pierce. The result was\r\nthe most progressive and far-seeing provision for public instruction in\r\nany state constitution up to that time; yet a measure that appealed to\r\nthe good sense and practical wisdom of the people of the State. In brief\r\nit provided that the Governor, with the Legislature, should \"encourage,\r\nby all suitable means, the promotion of intellectual, scientifical, and\r\nagricultural improvement\" and that, in particular, there should be\r\nappointed a Superintendent of Public Instruction, an officer then\r\nunknown to any of the states; that there should be created a perpetual\r\nand inviolable public fund from the sale of lands for the support of\r\npublic schools; and that provision should be made for libraries as well,\r\none at least in each township, to be supported from money paid for\r\nexemption from military service and from fines collected for any breach\r\nof the penal law. The section concerning the University was as follows:\r\n\r\n     The Legislature shall take measures for the protection,\r\n     improvement, or other disposition of such lands as have been or may\r\n     hereafter be reserved or granted by the United States, to this\r\n     state, for the support of a University, and the funds accruing from\r\n     the rents or sale of such lands, or from any other source, for the\r\n     purpose aforesaid, shall be and remain a permanent fund for the\r\n     support of said University, with such branches as the public\r\n     convenience may hereafter demand for the promotion of literature,\r\n     the arts and sciences, and as may be authorized by the terms of\r\n     such grant. And it shall be the duty of the Legislature, as soon as\r\n     may be, to provide effectual means for the improvement and\r\n     permanent security of the funds of said University.\r\n\r\nThis constitution went into effect as soon as Michigan became a state on\r\nthe 26th of January, 1837, though Pierce, afterwards known\r\naffectionately in University circles as \"Father Pierce,\" had already\r\nbeen serving as the Superintendent of Public Instruction since the\r\nprevious July. Upon him fell the important task of preparing a system\r\nfor the organization of common schools, together with a university and\r\nits branches. The system he devised has become a landmark in educational\r\nprogress throughout the world, as is shown by the numerous foreign\r\ndelegations which have visited the University in recent years for the\r\npurpose of studying our educational system. As for the plans outlined by\r\nPierce, which were quickly approved by the Legislature in March, 1837,\r\nwe can best quote President Angell when he said fifty years later: \"Our\r\nmeans have not yet enabled us to execute in all particulars the\r\ncomprehensive plan which was framed by Mr. Pierce.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no precedent in America for the task set him. Eight of the new\r\nstates, it is true, had accepted federal grants of land but had failed\r\nin the trust thus imposed, and the feeble schools they supported offered\r\nno more guidance than Michigan's two experiments in Detroit. The field\r\nwas practically virgin soil, actually as well as metaphorically; the\r\nproblem was the effective organization of a university on the basis of\r\nthe land given by the Government to the State for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe answer was the Organic Act of the University of Michigan approved\r\nMarch 18, 1837. In essentials it provided for a Board of Regents with a\r\nChancellor who should be ex-officio President. Of the Regents twelve\r\nwere to be nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate, while\r\nthe Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, the Judges of the Supreme Court, and\r\nthe Chancellor of the State were to be members ex-officio. The\r\nUniversity was to consist of a Department of Literature, Science, and\r\nthe Arts, a Department of Law, and a Department of Medicine. The\r\nprofessorships were specified and it is significant that, in addition to\r\nthe usual branches taught in those days, such as Ancient and Modern\r\nLanguages, Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, and Natural Theology, provision\r\nwas also made for professorships in Chemistry, Geology, Botany, Fine\r\nArts, and Civil Engineering and Architecture. A limiting clause,\r\nhowever, was incorporated in this ambitious scheme, which provided that\r\nonly so many professorships should be filled at first as the needs of\r\nthe institution warranted. While the immediate government of the\r\nUniversity was to be entrusted to the respective Faculties, the Regents\r\nhad final authority in the regulation of courses and the selection of\r\ntextbooks, and were empowered to remove any professor, tutor, or other\r\nofficer, when in their judgment the interests of the University required\r\nit. The fees were to be $10 for residents of the State. A Board of\r\nVisitors was also to be appointed by the Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction to make a personal examination of the University and report\r\nto him their observations and recommendations. It was also provided that\r\nsuch branches of the University were to be established in different\r\nparts of the State as might from time to time be authorized by the\r\nLegislature. These branches, however, were not to confer degrees, though\r\nthey were to have Departments of Agriculture in connection and also an\r\n\"institution for the education of females in the higher branches of\r\nknowledge, whenever suitable buildings should be provided for them.\" The\r\nfunds for these branches were to be appropriated from the University\r\nFund in sums proportionate to the number of scholars.\r\n\r\nShortly after the first meeting of the Board of Regents in 1837, the\r\nLegislature, following some of their suggestions, modified the\r\nUniversity Act in certain particulars; abolishing the Chancellorship of\r\nthe Board of Regents and making the Governor the President of that body,\r\nat the same time directing the Regents to elect a Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity who should not be a member of the Board. This act also gave\r\nthe Regents power to assign the duties of vacant professorships to any\r\nprofessor already appointed and to establish branches in the different\r\ncounties without further legislative authority. The Board was also\r\nauthorized to purchase philosophical apparatus, a library, and a cabinet\r\nof natural history.\r\n\r\nThese were the essential provisions for the University. With so novel a\r\nscheme the Regents and the Legislature naturally had to proceed on a\r\nmore or less cut and try method, but those at all familiar with the\r\norganization of the present institution will recognize familiar features\r\nin this first plan. One of the practical problems which faced those who\r\nheld the fate of the University in their charge was the question as to\r\nwhere students, sufficiently trained in the higher branches, were to be\r\nfound in a state which numbered, all told, not more than 100,000 souls,\r\nscattered for the most part in little frontier settlements. This\r\nexplains the provisions for the branches, which were to be in effect the\r\nhigh schools from which the University was to draw its students. For a\r\ntime this was the actual development; but after the branches were\r\ndiscontinued, high schools, supported by the various towns of the State,\r\ncame into existence and were eventually bound to the University through\r\nthe admission of their students by certificate. Thus the same end was\r\naccomplished and at less expense.\r\n\r\nWhen one considers the actual situation in Michigan at that time, the\r\nprogram outlined by this act seems extraordinarily ambitious if not\r\nactually ridiculous. The hard and primitive life of those days is almost\r\ninconceivable now, and yet the change has come well within the lifetime\r\nof the oldest inhabitants of many thriving cities of the State. The\r\nsecret lay in the extraordinary increase of the population. Settlers\r\ncame in so rapidly that, where in 1834 there were but 87,278\r\ninhabitants, there were over 212,267 in 1840, and it was precisely this\r\ngrowth, evidences of which were on every hand, that encouraged those\r\neducational pioneers to aim high. The result has justified their\r\noptimism; though there were to be many years of small things and limited\r\nmeans before the fulfillment of this early vision. As Professor Hinsdale\r\nwisely says in his History: \"A large scheme would do no harm provided no\r\nattempt were made at once to realize it, and it might in time be well\r\nfilled out; while a small plan, in case of large growth, would require\r\nreconstruction from the foundation.\" The result has amply proved the\r\nworth of the venture.\r\n\r\nAs has been seen, the University was to be but a part of a complete\r\nstate system. As a corollary in the minds of its sponsors private\r\ninstitutions were to be discouraged. Superintendent Pierce even queried\r\nwhether it would not be wise to forbid them altogether. That proving\r\nentirely impracticable, the alternative was to make the University and\r\nthe branches so good that private schools could not meet their\r\ncompetition. He first endeavored to prevent the chartering of private\r\ncolleges; later he sought to deny them the privilege of conferring\r\ndegrees. In this he asked the advice of Eastern educators, among them\r\nPresident Wayland, of Brown, who wrote him, \"By a great number of small\r\nand badly appointed colleges you will increase the nominally educated\r\nmen, but you will decrease the power of education because it will be\r\nlittle else but the name.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of this support his efforts, however, were not effective and in\r\n1839 the Legislature in the name of freedom and opposition to monopoly\r\npassed an Act to incorporate the Trustees of Marshall College, in\r\nPierce's own home town. By 1850 several such charters were granted and\r\nin 1855 the degree conferring power was given these institutions. It is\r\ndoubtless true that at least some of the opposition with which the\r\nUniversity had to contend during her early years may be traced to this\r\nfirst policy, which aroused the sectarian spirit behind the smaller\r\ncolleges and it was important to that extent; but far more significant\r\nwas the alternative of concentrating all the energies of the State in\r\nthe one great institution. Events have proved this the wise course. We\r\nhave had the example of less wise counsel in neighboring commonwealths\r\nwhere the state universities have suffered from a multiplication of\r\nsmall schools and have only recently been able to acquire their full\r\nstature as true universities.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the branches, which preceded the opening of the\r\nUniversity by several years, and their quick discontinuance, is an\r\ninteresting episode connected with the University's early years. They\r\nformed the necessary preparatory schools for the coming University, and\r\nfurnished the first instruction under its auspices in the new State. By\r\nthe end of 1838 five branches with 161 students had been established\r\nwith the \"decided approbation and support of the inhabitants.\" For some\r\nyears these academies flourished in a modest way, though they never\r\nenrolled more than 400 students in any one year. But this effort, which\r\noriginally aimed to cover every county in the State, soon arrived at the\r\nplace which might have been foreseen from the beginning. The branches\r\nbegan not only to overshadow the parent institution but actually to eat\r\nup all of the University's resources. The necessary action followed\r\nquickly when the University began to demand all the available income; in\r\n1842 the Regents gave notice that the appropriations for the branches\r\nwould be reduced and by 1846 all support was definitely withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThis was practically the end of these schools, though some of them\r\nmanaged to maintain a precarious existence for a few years. They had,\r\nhowever, served a useful purpose. Without the students they trained it\r\nis difficult to imagine where the first classes to graduate would have\r\nreceived the preparation which enabled the University to maintain\r\ncollegiate, instead of preparatory, courses,--the rock upon which so\r\nmany institutions stumbled. Then, too, they accustomed the people of the\r\nState to the idea of schools affiliated with the University and prepared\r\nthe way for the local high schools which within a short time came to\r\nserve the same purposes as had the branches. Finally they performed a\r\nvaluable service in the preparation of teachers for the common schools.\r\nThe $35,000 spent by the Regents on these branches was therefore far\r\nfrom wasted. Rather it was one of the series of fortunate measures,\r\nsomewhat blindly entered upon, which served the University well; but it\r\nis equally true that the abandonment of the policy came only in the nick\r\nof time, for the Regents were already in serious financial difficulties.\r\n\r\nWith all of these favorable influences, the horoscope of the University\r\nwas at least propitious. The people of the State were familiar with the\r\nidea of a state educational system; the immigrants from the East were\r\nfor the most part homogeneous and of a progressive spirit; it was\r\nbelieved that an adequate income for the educational program was assured\r\nfrom the sale of state lands; provision had been made for the proper\r\npreparation of matriculates in the University; and above all, wise and\r\nfar-sighted men had devised a scheme of organization which showed\r\nfamiliarity with the best there was in educational development at that\r\ntime. We can now take up the story of the University itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE UNIVERSITY'S EARLY DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were several candidates among the towns of the State for the honor\r\nof having the University. Detroit, Monroe, and Marshall were mentioned,\r\nbut an offer of forty acres of land by the Ann Arbor Land Company,\r\npreviously offered unsuccessfully as a site for the state capitol,\r\nproved the most attractive bid, and the Legislature voted in favor of\r\nAnn Arbor in an act signed by the Governor, March 20, 1837. The town was\r\nthen fourteen years old and boasted some 2,000 inhabitants, who\r\nsupported four churches, two newspapers, two banks, seventeen drygoods\r\nstores, eleven lawyers, nine doctors, and eight mills and manufacturing\r\nplants, including a good-sized plow factory. Nevertheless it was in\r\nessentials a frontier community. There are those still living who\r\nremember the Indians who came in to town to trade,--presumably at those\r\nseventeen drygoods stores. Transportation was primitive, the first\r\nrailroad did not come until 1839; while great tracts of uninhabited land\r\nlay on every side.\r\n\r\nOf the twelve Regents by appointment who were members of the first\r\nBoard, six had been members of the Constitutional Convention, two were\r\nphysicians, and four were lawyers; seven had received collegiate\r\ndegrees, while one, Henry R. Schoolcraft, was the best authority of that\r\ntime on the American Indian. General Crary appears to have been the only\r\none who had previously concerned himself with educational matters, so\r\nit is small wonder that some impracticable measures were taken.\r\n\r\nTo those of us who look back now with the advantage of \"hind-sight,\" the\r\nmistakes of the first Board are obvious. Two tracts of land were\r\nconsidered as possible sites for the University. The choice fell upon\r\nthe wrong one, and we now have the present Campus, undistinguished by\r\nany natural advantages, instead of the commanding location on the hills\r\noverlooking the Huron, recommended by the committee appointed at the\r\nfirst session. We do not know now why the change was made, though there\r\nmust have been some little discussion, as it was only made by a vote of\r\n6 to 5. We can only imagine now how much more beautiful and impressive\r\nthe buildings of the future University might have been, lining the brows\r\nof the hills overlooking the Huron Valley, rather than spreading over\r\nthe flat rough clearing of the Rumsey farm that by that time had lost\r\nthe attraction which the original forest trees must once have given it.\r\nFor many years the present Campus remained what it was originally, a bit\r\nof farm land, where wheat was grown on the unoccupied portions and where\r\nthe families of the four professors who lived on the Campus gathered\r\npeaches from the old farm orchard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAMPUS IN 1855 (From a painting by Cropsey)]\r\n\r\nAt their first meeting the Regents undertook the preliminary steps\r\ntowards the appointment of a Faculty, though a resolution asking for a\r\nchange in the University Act, giving them power to elect and prescribe\r\nthe duties of a Chancellor of the University, suggests that they were\r\nuncertain of their powers in this matter. Four prospective\r\nprofessorships were established and though the report of the committee\r\non the matter was not adopted as presented, the assignment of the\r\nsubjects is suggestive; they included a Professor of Mental\r\nPhilosophy, whose field was to comprise Moral Philosophy, Natural\r\nTheology, Rhetoric, Oratory, Logic, and the History of All Religions; a\r\nProfessor of Mathematics, to have also in charge Civil Engineering and\r\nArchitecture; a Professor of Languages, to have in charge the Roman and\r\nGreek languages; and a Professor of Law. This action came four years\r\nbefore the actual appointment of Professors of Languages and Mathematics\r\nand twenty-two years before a Professor of Law was needed. A librarian,\r\nthe Rev. Henry Colclazer, was also appointed, the first officer of the\r\nUniversity chosen, though he did not assume his duties or his munificent\r\nsalary of $100 a year until 1841. The question of the organization of\r\nthe branches, which became the perennial subject of discussion at all\r\nthe early meetings of the Board, also came up at this time through the\r\nauthorization of a Committee on Branches, and a request that the\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction furnish an \"outline of a plan of\r\nthe University.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this time on meetings of the Regents were held with fair\r\nregularity, either in Ann Arbor or, more usually, in the capitol city,\r\nwhich at that time was Detroit. Occasional difficulties in obtaining a\r\nquorum are discernible, however, in the reports of the early meetings.\r\nThe trip on horseback or stage from Detroit to Ann Arbor during the\r\nfirst two years was not always easy or convenient, while there was\r\nlittle to arouse enthusiasm in the slow development of the Campus. The\r\nquestion of a library and scientific apparatus interested the Board from\r\nthe first meeting and among their early purchases was a collection of\r\nminerals made by one Baron Lederer which consisted of 2,600 specimens,\r\npurchased in January, 1838, for $4,000. In July of the same year, Dr.\r\nAsa Gray was made a Professor of Botany and Zooelogy, the first\r\nprofessor to be appointed. He was contemplating a trip to Europe and was\r\nentrusted by the Regents with $5,000 for the purchase of a library. This\r\ncharge he performed to the great satisfaction of the Regents, sending\r\nback a collection of 3,700 volumes in all the branches ordinarily taught\r\nat that time, including many books unobtainable in America. This task\r\nended Professor Gray's connection with Michigan. Practically all his\r\nlong and distinguished career was spent as a professor in Harvard\r\nUniversity. Another purchase of this period, probably the first\r\nacquisition for the library, which seems curiously extravagant for the\r\nofficers of an \"incipient\" University, was Audubon's \"Birds of America.\"\r\nAt the present time it is worth many times the $970 paid for it then,\r\nbut one wonders, in view of the extreme slenderness of the resources of\r\nthe University, just what was the idea which led to its purchase. It was\r\nin any case an evidence of the interest of the Board in practical\r\nscientific studies and their sympathy with what was then the progressive\r\nmovement in education.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Regents were making haste slowly in erecting the\r\nUniversity buildings. In accordance with the \"grand design\" of the\r\nUniversity Act, a New Haven architect was commissioned to prepare what\r\nproved to be, according to Superintendent Pierce, \"a truly magnificent\r\ndesign.\" The Governor and the Board of Regents approved this plan but\r\nthe Superintendent of Public Instruction, with a better sense of\r\nrealities, refused his assent. He maintained that a university did not\r\nconsist of fine buildings, \"but in the number and ability of its\r\nProfessors, and in its other appointments, as libraries, cabinets, and\r\nworks of art.\" So this scheme which would have cost five hundred\r\nthousand dollars, or twice the amount of what had at that time been\r\nrealized from the University lands, was abandoned, apparently to the\r\ngreat disappointment of the citizens of Ann Arbor, who showed their\r\ndisapproval by a public indignation meeting.\r\n\r\nThe plan finally adopted had at least the merit of modesty and some\r\ndegree of serviceability. It called for the erection of six buildings,\r\ntwo to serve as dormitories and class rooms and four as professors'\r\nhouses, all on the Campus. The first of the dormitories was completed in\r\n1841, at a cost of about $16,000; while the four professors' houses,\r\nwhich were ready at the same time, cost $30,850. The dormitory, which\r\nwas the first University building, is now the north wing of University\r\nHall. It was a gaunt, bleak structure in those days, one hundred and ten\r\nby forty feet, whose stark outlines were softened nowhere by trees and\r\nshrubbery. The original plan called for sixty-four bedrooms and\r\nthirty-two studies, but the necessity of including a chapel and a\r\nrecitation room on the first and second floors, the library on the\r\nthird, and a museum on the fourth, severely limited the space for the\r\nstudents' rooms. In 1843 the building was named Mason Hall, in honor of\r\nthe late Governor who had just died, but the name was long forgotten\r\nuntil revived in 1914, when a tablet was placed by the D.A.R. on the\r\nbuilding, which has since been called by that name. Contemporary opinion\r\nis reflected in a description of this building in the _Michigan State\r\nJournal_ of August 10, 1841, where we read: \"More classical models or a\r\nmore beautiful finish cannot be imagined. They honor the architect,\r\nwhile they beautify the village.\" From this one cannot but suspect that\r\njournalistic exaggeration is not entirely a latter-day fault, although\r\nthe opinion of Governor Barry seems to have been somewhat the same when\r\nhe charged the Regents with \"vast expenditures\" for \"large and\r\ncommodious buildings, which ... will doubtless at some future period be\r\nwanted for occupation and use.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the Governor's strictures were not entirely\r\nunjustified, as the four professors' houses proved a continual source of\r\nannoyance and expense, while the wisdom of erecting a building to be\r\nused largely as a dormitory when students could easily have lived in the\r\ntown, as they do nowadays, was doubtful. Governor Barry is reported to\r\nhave said in 1842 that \"as the State had the buildings and had no other\r\nuse for them, it was probably best to continue the school.\" That was in\r\nthe period of the lowest ebb of the University's fortunes which followed\r\nsoon after its doors were opened, and, as Professor Ten Brook remarked,\r\nit showed that the balance of the scale between suspending and going\r\nforward may have been turned in favor of the University by the bare fact\r\nof having these architectural preparations. The second and corresponding\r\nbuilding was not erected until 1849 at the cost of about $13,000. A few\r\nmonths later the Medical Building was completed.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the University were in a critical state by 1843. The sale\r\nof the state lands had resulted in no such sum as had been expected; the\r\nbranches had been eating up what little income there was; while an\r\nunfortunate bit of financiering on the part of the Regents in 1838,\r\ninvolving a loan of $100,000 from the State for the immediate completion\r\nof the necessary buildings and the establishment of the branches, only\r\nadded to the difficulties. The history of this loan is a complicated one\r\nwhich does not need to be detailed here. The expense incurred in\r\nestablishing the branches, the purchases for the library and mineral\r\ncollections, and the erection of the buildings practically exhausted\r\nit. When it was made the Regents supposed that the income from the state\r\nlands would more than cover the interest, but this proved a vain hope.\r\nPractically every bit of the University's income was needed for this\r\npurpose. The situation was only saved in 1844 by the Legislature\r\npermitting the Regents to apply depreciated treasury notes and other\r\nstate scrip received for the sale of University lands at a fixed\r\nvaluation in the payment of this debt, as well as accepting some\r\nproperty in Detroit. This relieved the situation so that soon after that\r\ntime the Regents were able to report that the disbursements were less\r\nthan the receipts. For several years the State exacted interest for this\r\nloan and in 1850 deducted $100,000 from the University fund held by the\r\nState. Three years later, however, the Legislature directed that the\r\ninterest upon the whole amount of the lands sold be paid to the\r\nUniversity. This was done by successive Legislatures until in 1877 the\r\n$100,000 was finally returned to the University fund through an\r\nadjustment of the accounting system of the State. Whether the return of\r\nthis $100,000 constitutes a gift to the University by the State is still\r\na matter of discussion. Professor Ten Brook, in his \"History of American\r\nState Universities,\" written, however, in 1875, before the final\r\nadjustment was made, maintained that the University had already paid\r\nthis debt, while Professor Hinsdale, in his later \"History of the\r\nUniversity,\" more properly insisted that actually the University never\r\nrepaid the debt, and that this $100,000 was eventually made a gift and\r\nthus became the first direct state support of the University of\r\nMichigan.\r\n\r\nThe whole history of the early finances of the University is one of\r\ngreat expectations and of small resources not always judiciously used.\r\nThe sums expended upon the branches were not spent in vain, for they\r\nprovided the scholastic foundation of the University in its first years.\r\nNor is the erection of University buildings to be criticized, except as\r\nto their impractical character. This defect the experience of a few\r\nyears was to show, for one of the first acts of Dr. Tappan, when he\r\nbecame President in 1852, was to end the use of the two University\r\nbuildings as dormitories; while the professors' houses, with the\r\nexception of the one reserved as the President's residence, were\r\neventually used for general University purposes and at one time were\r\neven let as boarding houses.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1841, the University first opened its doors with a Faculty\r\nof two. The first Professor appointed to assume active duties was the\r\nRev. George Palmer Williams, formerly the head of the Pontiac branch,\r\nwho was elected in July, 1841, as Professor of Languages. In August, the\r\nRev. Joseph Whiting was elected Professor of Languages, and Professor\r\nWilliams was transferred to the Professorship of Mathematics, and,\r\nlater, of Natural Philosophy. Strictly speaking these two were not the\r\nfirst professors in the University, as Asa Gray had received his\r\nappointment as Professor of Botany in July, 1838, and Dr. Douglass\r\nHoughton had been elected Professor of Chemistry, Zooelogy, and\r\nMineralogy in October, 1839. Though both of these distinguished men\r\nrendered services to the University, one in the selection of the\r\nlibrary, and the other in contributions to the scientific collections,\r\nneither ever met any classes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO OF THE UNIVERSITY'S OLDEST BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT'S HOUSE\r\nThe only one of the original four professors' houses\r\n\r\nTHE OLD MEDICAL BUILDING\r\nTorn down in 1914]\r\n\r\nThe grand total of the students who ventured to try the educational\r\nfacilities offered when the University at last got down to business was\r\nexactly six: Judson D. Collins, Lyndon Township; Merchant H. Goodrich,\r\nAnn Arbor; Lyman D. Norris, Ypsilanti; George E. Parmalee, Ann Arbor;\r\nGeorge W. Pray, Superior; and William B. Wesson, Detroit. By the time\r\nthis class was graduated in 1845, the number had increased to twelve.\r\nThe mental fare set before this little company consisted of the\r\ntraditional classical curriculum, which differed not at all from the\r\nordinary college course of those days in spite of the progressive spirit\r\nof the founders. For the Freshmen, Livy, Xenophon, and algebra occupied\r\nthe first term. Horace, Thucydides, Herodotus, and Roman antiquities,\r\nmore algebra, geometry and botany, the second term; while Horace, Homer,\r\ngeometry, mensuration, and the application of algebra to geometry\r\ncompleted the year. More Greek and Latin and higher mathematics were\r\nscheduled for the second year, while science in the shape of lectures in\r\nzooelogy and chemistry and two courses in intellectual and moral science,\r\nrepresented by Abercrombie's \"Intellectual Powers\" and Paley's \"Natural\r\nTheology,\" were added to their classical and mathematical studies during\r\nthe third year. Geology and calculus were introduced the fourth year, as\r\nwell as courses in philosophy, moral science, psychology, logic,\r\neconomics, and political science. No modern languages, medieval or\r\nmodern history, or laboratory courses in science, save what practical\r\ndemonstrations could be made from the cabinet of minerals, were offered,\r\nto say nothing of engineering, architecture, law, or medicine. The\r\ntraditions of centuries were still too strong and the institution too\r\nweak.\r\n\r\nUpon this modest foundation the curriculum slowly grew; new\r\nprofessorships were added from time to time as they became imperatively\r\nnecessary, so that little by little opportunities developed for the\r\nleaven of the new spirit in education to work. In 1843 the Rev. Edward\r\nThomson, afterwards President of Ohio Wesleyan University, was\r\nappointed Professor of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy. He only stayed\r\none year; and was succeeded by the Rev. Andrew Ten Brook, in after years\r\nLibrarian and historian of the University. In 1842, Abram Sager, M.D.,\r\nafterwards a member of the Medical Faculty, was made Professor of\r\nZooelogy and Botany, while Silas H. Douglas, M.D., who was later to\r\norganize the Chemical Laboratory, came in 1844 as an assistant to the\r\nabsent Professor of Chemistry, Dr. Houghton. The chair of Logic,\r\nRhetoric, and History was filled the next year by the Rev. Daniel D.\r\nWhedon; while the chair of Greek and Latin, left vacant by the death of\r\nDr. Whiting about this time, was filled by the Rev. John H. Agnew. In\r\n1846, a Professor of Modern Languages, Louis Fasquelle, LL.D., was\r\nappointed and became one of the most distinguished members of that early\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nThese were the men who cast their lot with the very precarious fortunes\r\nof the new University. The first two resident members of the Faculty,\r\nwho came to the University from the branches, suffered a considerable\r\ndiminution of their salary, as the scale outlined at the first Regents'\r\nMeeting was more than halved; they received annually but five hundred\r\ndollars and the rent of their houses. In fact it was not for many years\r\nthat the $2,000 maximum salary first established was reached. Even these\r\nsalaries were not certain in the dark days of 1842 and 1843, when the\r\nRegents felt it their duty to make known to the Faculty the University's\r\nfinancial difficulties. The University owes not a little, surely, to\r\nthese men who signified their willingness to stick by the institution\r\nand to endure privations and hardships as long as there was hope.\r\n\r\nLife for the students in those days was also no bed of academic ease,\r\nthough it was perhaps no harder than the home life to which they were\r\naccustomed. One study with the two adjoining bedrooms was assigned to\r\ntwo students who were expected to care for their own rooms and sweep the\r\ndirt into the halls for Pat Kelly, the \"Professor of Dust and Ashes,\" as\r\nwell as to cut their own wood at the woodpile behind the building and\r\ncarry it in, sometimes up three flights of stairs. Chapel exercises were\r\nheld from 5:30 to 6:30 in the morning and at 4:30 or 5:00 in the\r\nafternoon, according to the time of year, and were compulsory. Tradition\r\nhas it that the efforts of the official monitors were supplemented by\r\nthe janitor, whose duty it was to ring a bell, borrowed from the\r\nMichigan Central Railroad, and who aroused more than one delinquent by\r\nshouting, \"Did yez hear the bell?\", a commentary either on the bell or\r\non Pat Kelly's voice. To a student of modern days the greatest hardship\r\nwould appear in the first recitation of the day before breakfast\r\nfollowing chapel exercises. Three classes were held daily except on\r\nSaturday, when there was only one recitation and an exercise in\r\nelocution.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the students were obliged to attend service in some one of the\r\nchurches, and monitors, sometimes not overzealous, were on hand to see\r\nthat they attended. The expenses are given as from $80 to $100 a year,\r\nwith an entrance fee of $10 and an annual tax of $7.50 for the use of\r\nthe room and janitor's services. Students were allowed to leave the\r\nCampus for their meals but were expected to be on hand from morning\r\nprayers to 7:30 A.M., from 9:00 A.M. to 12:00 noon, from 2:00 to 5:00\r\nP.M. and from 7:00 or 8:00 to 9:00 P.M., after which no student was\r\npermitted to leave the Campus. The question of illumination was a\r\nserious one in those days, and these periods varied somewhat with the\r\nlength of daylight. The cost of candles for early recitations and chapel\r\nexercises was borne by the students.\r\n\r\nThe number of students increased each year up to 1847-48, when there\r\nwere 89 enrolled. After that time, the withdrawal of University support\r\nfrom the branches and their gradual abandonment began to show its effect\r\nin the enrolment, which dropped to 57 in 1851-52. Twenty-three students\r\nwere graduated with the class of 1849, while there were only nine in\r\n1852. The struggling little towns of the State found enough difficulty\r\nfor the time in supporting primary schools. The branches, however, had\r\nproved their necessity, and it was not long before the rise of the Union\r\nschools began to provide a stream of students which has flowed to the\r\nUniversity uninterruptedly since that time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUR MEMBERS OF THE EARLY FACULTY\r\n\r\n  George Palmer Williams (1802-1881)\r\n  Andrew Ten Brook (1814-1899)\r\n  Abram Sager (1810-1877)\r\n  Thomas McIntyre Cooley (1824-1898)]\r\n\r\nThere was another and probably more immediate reason for the falling off\r\nin attendance. This was the great struggle between the Faculty and the\r\nstudents over the establishment of Greek-letter societies, a contest\r\nwhich became so bitter that not only the town but the State Legislature\r\nwas involved. A large number of students were expelled, and eventually\r\nthe whole relationship between students and Faculty was placed upon a\r\ndifferent basis. The trouble began in the spring of 1846, when some\r\nstudent depredations were traced to a small log house situated in the\r\ndepths of what was then known as the Black Forest, the deep wood which\r\nextended far east of the Campus. This building, which probably stood\r\nsomewhere on the present site of the Forest Hill Cemetery, was\r\ndiscovered to be the headquarters of the Chi Psi fraternity, the first\r\nchapter house built by any American college fraternity. When the faculty\r\ninvestigator sought entrance to this building, he found his way\r\nbarred by resolute fratres. This led to the ultimate disclosure of the\r\nfact that two fraternities, Chi Psi and Beta Theta Pi, had been\r\nestablished in the University for at least a year, in direct violation\r\nof a regulation known as Rule 20, apparently in force for some time,\r\nwhich provided that:\r\n\r\n     No student shall be or become a member of any society connected\r\n     with the University which has not first submitted its Constitution\r\n     to the Faculty and received their approval.\r\n\r\nThe students involved, however, were willing enough to give lists of\r\ntheir members, relying upon their numbers and their affiliation with\r\nsimilar organizations in other colleges to avoid any unpleasant\r\nconsequences. The Faculty thought otherwise; though as events proved\r\ntheir authority was not too well defined. Meanwhile another society,\r\nAlpha Delta Phi, had submitted a constitution to the Faculty for\r\napproval; but owing to the press of other matters it was not considered\r\nand the chapter was organized with no action by the authorities. The\r\ngreater number of the students in the University thus became members of\r\nthe three Greek-letter fraternities.\r\n\r\nThe Faculty was disturbed, but apparently did not take the matter too\r\nseriously at first and decided to allow the societies to continue,\r\nmerely exacting pledges from all new students to join no society without\r\napproval by the Faculty; thus providing as they thought, for an early\r\ndemise of the fraternities. It did not work out that way, however. The\r\nchapter of Alpha Delta Phi held that their society existed at least by\r\nsufferance of the Faculty, and proceeded to initiate members, a fact\r\nthat was not discovered until March, 1847. Then followed a series of\r\nsuspensions and re-admissions of students who had promised not to join\r\nthese societies. Not only were they obliged to resign their membership,\r\nbut the original members of Alpha Delta Phi were compelled formally to\r\nsubmit to re-admission to the University, pledging themselves not to\r\nconsent to the initiation of any members of the University in the\r\nsociety in opposition to Rule 20. The matter rested here until the\r\nfollowing November, when the society presented a second constitution,\r\nwhich was received by the Faculty with the announcement that they had no\r\nauthority to legalize the society. This reply was answered by the\r\nstudents with a plea that if the Faculty had no authority to legalize\r\ntheir fraternity then they had no authority to forbid it. Later another\r\nfraternity asked for re-admission with similar results.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile these organizations were maintaining themselves. Letters to\r\nthe Presidents of six Eastern colleges brought replies most unfavorable\r\nto the fraternities and seemed to indicate to the Faculty that elsewhere\r\nthe fraternities were under a strict ban. The students, however, knew\r\nthat the facts were otherwise and that fraternities were flourishing in\r\nmost of the institutions where they had been established. Finally in\r\nDecember, 1849, a list of members of the Chi Psi fraternity, which\r\nincluded the names of many new students, was found in a University\r\ncatalogue. The defense set up by the chapter was that they were not\r\nmembers of a society \"_in_ the University of Michigan\" but \"_in_ Ann\r\nArbor,\" that they did not meet on University grounds, and that they had\r\nadmitted three members who were not students. One of these members was,\r\nin fact, a member of the Board of Regents. The society, therefore, was\r\nnot connected with the University and did not consist of students. This\r\ndefense was considered only an evasion and on the last day of the term\r\nin 1849 the Faculty announced that the members of Chi Psi and Alpha\r\nDelta Phi, whose names had in the meantime been made public, must cease\r\ntheir connection with the University, unless they renounced their\r\nconnection with their fraternities. Of the members of these two\r\nsocieties seven withdrew their membership; the others were expelled. The\r\nmembers of Beta Theta Pi were not expelled until September, 1850,\r\napparently because the constitution had not yet been signed, to the\r\ndisgust of one member of the Faculty, who considered this excuse only a\r\nlegalistic quibble. Some of the students expelled went to other\r\ninstitutions, some eventually returned to the University, while others\r\nended their college days.\r\n\r\nThis action naturally caused an uproar; neither the Faculty nor the\r\nRegents were unanimous in approval of these measures; while the citizens\r\nof Ann Arbor held an indignation meeting and appointed a committee to\r\nask the Legislature for a change in the administration of the\r\nUniversity. The Faculty prepared a report to the Regents stating their\r\ncase strongly and even bitterly, characterizing the whole history of\r\nthese three societies as \"a detail of obliquities,\" and their \"extended\r\naffiliations as a great irresponsible authority, a monster power, which\r\nlays its hand upon every College Faculty in our country\"; they were also\r\nfearful of the \"debauchery, drunkenness, pugilism, and duelling, ... and\r\nthe despotic power of disorder and ravagism, rife among their German\r\nprototypes.\" This report was signed by all the Faculty, though the\r\nopinion was not unanimous, nor had all the actions of individual members\r\nbeen consistent.\r\n\r\nThe Regents also made a report sustaining the Faculty, and both were\r\nsubmitted to the Legislature, accompanied by a reply made by the seven\r\nreinstated students, who denied the charges. They even maintained that\r\nRule 20 was a dead letter and that one of the Professors, when consulted\r\nat the time one of the fraternities was founded, did not disapprove, or\r\nquote this law. A memorial was also submitted by fifteen \"neutral\"\r\nstudents sustaining the Faculty and suggesting that the threatened\r\nlegislation, which was advocated by the committee of Ann Arbor citizens,\r\nwas the greatest obstacle to harmony. Unfortunately this legislative\r\naction was just what seemed inevitable for some time. The Ann Arbor\r\ncitizens represented that the University was failing, and that the only\r\nway to save it was by an entire change in its organic law, the\r\nappointment of a new Faculty, and the recognition of that natural right\r\nof man--to form secret societies if he so elects.\r\n\r\nTheir case before the Legislature, however, had been weakened by the\r\naction of two students who had circulated a week or so in advance a\r\ngarbled and caricatured form of the Faculty report, which had been\r\nsubmitted honorably to the students to enable them to make a reply if\r\nthey so desired. This undoubtedly prejudiced the student case when the\r\ntruth became known, and the net result was no action by the Legislature\r\non any of the memorials. With the withdrawal of the bill, the Faculty\r\nand the Regents were left to handle the question as seemed best to them.\r\nIn the meantime, however, the opposition to the suppression of the\r\nsocieties had become so widespread and aggressive that one by one the\r\nfraternities were \"conditionally\" reinstated in October, 1850.\r\n\r\nWhile the upshot of all this hostility was, superficially, only a return\r\nto the _status quo_, the students had won their point. The germ of the\r\ntrouble probably lay in the difference between the paternalistic\r\nattitude of the Faculty, traditional in all colleges of the time, and\r\nthe beginning of a new and progressive spirit in University life. The\r\nstudents had been brought up in an atmosphere which developed\r\nindividuality and self-reliance and they resented a meticulous\r\nregulation of their lives and doubtless contrasted it unfavorably with\r\nwhat they knew of European Universities. The whole fraternity struggle\r\nof 1848-50 may then be regarded, in part at least, as a successful\r\neffort on the students' part to ensure a different and more liberal\r\npolicy toward student life and affairs on the part of the authorities.\r\n\r\nNot the least of the troubles this contest brought to the University was\r\nthe revelation of its weakness, not only the plainly evident lack of\r\nharmony within the Faculty, but also the practical demonstration it\r\nfurnished of the Faculty's lack of real power. The reasons for this go\r\nback once more to the act establishing the University, which allowed the\r\nRegents to delegate to the Faculties only such authority as they saw\r\nfit, in practice not any too much, for the Regents maintained apparently\r\na close and personal supervision over the University. This was shown by\r\nthe habit of some members of the Board, notably Major Kearsley of\r\nDetroit, of conducting final oral examinations at the end of the term.\r\nMajor Kearsley, a veteran of the War of 1812, was something of a\r\nmartinet and prided himself upon his learning; so he usually gave the\r\nstudents a very hard time. He was soon dubbed \"Major Tormentum\" from\r\n_majora tormenta_, the name given big guns, or cannon, in a Latin \"Life\r\nof Washington\" then used in the classes. His visits finally ceased after\r\nthe students found out how to deal with him and came loaded with \"grape\r\nand canister,\" as one member of the class of '48 put it, to return his\r\nheavy fire.\r\n\r\nFrom its earliest days the University insisted upon maintaining a\r\nnon-sectarian character, but this did not imply any lack of religious\r\ntraining or supervision,--quite the contrary, as has been suggested. The\r\nscarcity of representatives of the cloth on the first Board of Regents\r\ndid not pass unremarked, and it was but a short time before several\r\nclergymen, one a Catholic priest, became members of the governing body,\r\nto offset the preponderance of lawyers and politicians and to furnish\r\nthe Board the benefits of their presumably wider experience in\r\neducational matters. Every effort was made, however, to keep a proper\r\nbalance among the different persuasions, and all the Protestant churches\r\ncame to feel that they had almost a vested right to representation, as\r\nthe long list of \"Reverends\" in the first Faculty list shows. Professor\r\nWilliams was an Episcopalian; Dr. Whedon, a Methodist; Professor Agnew,\r\na Presbyterian; and Professor Ten Brook, a Baptist. Whenever a vacancy\r\noccurred, the question of religious affiliations was at least as\r\nimportant in the ultimate selection of the candidates, as any\r\nqualifications in the subject to be taught. This situation naturally led\r\nto a certain degree of rivalry, partisanship, and lack of co-operation\r\nin the Faculty.\r\n\r\nTo this the lack of a Chancellor during those earlier years only added\r\nfurther confusion. From the first the Regents had proposed the\r\nappointment of such an officer, but in the absence of any clear notion\r\nof their authority and his precise duties the matter was allowed to\r\nlapse, until the financial difficulties of the early years after the\r\nUniversity opened made it clearly obvious that such an officer would be\r\nsomething of a luxury. The matter was settled by making each professor\r\nin turn President, or Principal, for one year, a practice which\r\ncontinued until the appointment of President, or Chancellor, Tappan in\r\n1852. This alternation in office was approved as eminently democratic\r\nand as following the practice of the German Universities, the ideal of\r\nthe time. In a report submitted by the Board of Visitors in 1850, the\r\nplan was commended and it was even urged that the monarchical feature of\r\na Chancellor should be struck out of the Organic Law, and the system\r\nthen in force thereby fixed for all time.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the plan was none too successful in application. There was\r\ntoo much opportunity for jealousy and too little central authority. This\r\nis shown plainly in the contest which arose over the hours of teaching\r\nas the numbers in the University grew. The emphasis in the curriculum\r\nupon the classics has been noted. This threw the burden of almost the\r\nwhole course of study upon Professor Agnew after the services of a\r\nsingle tutor were dispensed with in 1846. Professors Whedon and Ten\r\nBrook were therefore called upon to assist him, which they did\r\nunwillingly, Professor Whedon finally refusing to hear further classes\r\nin Greek.\r\n\r\nThe trouble grew and finally resulted in the resignation of Professor\r\nTen Brook in 1851, because of the opposition of three other members of\r\nthe Faculty. In after years he came to consider this action a mistake;\r\nparticularly as he had the respect and friendship of the Board of\r\nRegents, who brought about the downfall of his opponents within six\r\nmonths. This began in an action against Professor Whedon, who had for\r\nsome time aroused opposition by his pronounced anti-slavery views. As a\r\nresult of this feeling, on December 31, 1851, at the last session of the\r\nBoard of Regents by appointment before a new Board elected under the new\r\nState Constitution was to take its place, a resolution was introduced\r\nrequesting the removal of the Rev. D.D. Whedon for the reason that he\r\nhad--\r\n\r\n     not only publicly preached, but otherwise openly advocated the\r\n     doctrine called \"the higher law,\" a doctrine which is unauthorized\r\n     by the Bible, at war with the principles, precepts and examples of\r\n     Christ and his Apostles, subversive alike of civil government,\r\n     civil society, and the legal rights of individual citizens, and in\r\n     effect constitutes, in the opinion of this Board, a species of\r\n     moral treason against the Government.\r\n\r\nThis resolution seems to have expressed the real sentiment of the\r\nRegents; but the actual measure passed was a resolution declaring, that\r\nin view of the fact that a new Board of Regents was to take charge and\r\nappoint a President, it was expedient that the terms of Professors\r\nWilliams, Whedon, and Agnew terminate at the close of the year. This was\r\nan out and out partisan matter, as there was no reason for such action\r\ninherent in the change of the governing body, particularly as it did not\r\naffect two members of the Faculty who had avoided participation in this\r\nfamily jar. The new Board chose, however, to act upon it and the three\r\nresignations were accepted. Professor Williams was later reappointed, as\r\nhe had apparently taken a minor part in the opposition to Professor Ten\r\nBrook. This whole episode was most unfortunate and was brought about by\r\nthe lack of a strong guiding administrative policy. Professor Ten Brook\r\nin his later review generously says of these men: \"A stronger body of\r\nmen of the same number was probably never associated in such an opening\r\nenterprise,\" and again, \"We should find that their merits would be\r\nmagnified and their mistakes diminished by a consideration of the\r\ncomplicated, and till then unknown difficulties with which they had to\r\ncontend.\"\r\n\r\nWith a Chancellor to guide and direct the Faculty and to exert, on\r\noccasion, a restraining hand, a large part of these troubles might have\r\nbeen avoided. The Regents had early discovered their dependence upon the\r\nwhims of the Legislature, particularly in financial matters, while the\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction was given too much authority. In\r\nfact, a Committee of the Legislature appointed as early as 1840 stated\r\nin its report: \"A Board of experienced Regents could manage the funds\r\nand machinery of the University better than any Legislature; and the\r\nFaculty could manage the business of education--the interior of a\r\nCollege--better than any Regents.\"\r\n\r\nThis was becoming recognized; the University's difficulties only\r\nemphasized what had become a general opinion. Accordingly the sections\r\nof the new Constitution of 1850 relating to the University were\r\nthoroughly discussed in the Convention; with the result that certain new\r\nprovisions were incorporated which gave the University of Michigan a\r\nunique standing among state universities. Particularly important were\r\nthe measures relating to the Board of Regents. In the first place, it\r\nwas provided that they should be elected by the people, one for each\r\njudicial district, and at the same time the judges of each circuit were\r\nelected. Ten years later the latter provision was changed so that the\r\nnumber of Regents was definitely fixed at eight; two to be elected every\r\ntwo years at the regular election of the justices of the Supreme Court.\r\nIn the second place, it was provided that while the Regents should have\r\nonly general supervision of the University, they should have the\r\ndirection and control of all expenditures from the University interest\r\nfund. These provisions were far-reaching. They made the Board of Regents\r\na constituent part of the State Government, on an equality as regards\r\npowers with the Governor, the Legislature, and the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nFrom the time this action went into effect we may date the larger growth\r\nof the University. The selection of the Regents is as far removed from\r\npolitical influence as it is possible to make it under our electoral\r\nsystem, and they are given absolute control of the income of the\r\nUniversity and the appropriations of the Legislature, once they are\r\nmade; provided of course they are used for the purposes designated.\r\n\r\nA further provision of the Constitution specified the immediate\r\nappointment of a President. The old plan was not considered suitable for\r\nan American college. This sentiment was so strong that the Convention\r\nwas unwilling to leave this matter to the discretion of the Regents and\r\ntherefore they made action imperative. All that was necessary now was\r\nthe adaptation of the organic Act of the University to the new\r\nConstitution. This was accomplished on April 8, 1851, when a new Act was\r\nadopted, in essentials far simpler and more general in its terms than\r\nthe old one, which left the University free to enter upon the remarkable\r\ngrowth and expansion which began with the administration of President\r\nTappan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST ADMINISTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new University Act had charged the Regents with the duty of electing\r\na President immediately. It was some time, however, before they found\r\nthe right man, Henry Philip Tappan, LL.D., who was inaugurated as the\r\nfirst President of the University of Michigan on December 22, 1852. Dr.\r\nTappan's name was first suggested by George Bancroft, the historian, who\r\nwas also considered for the position, but there was some opposition,\r\nwhich seems to have centered about the fact that Dr. Tappan had once\r\nconsulted a homeopathic physician, and he was not elected until August\r\n12.\r\n\r\nPresident, or as he was often called, Chancellor Tappan was a man of\r\nwide culture, of established reputation as a scholar, and an author on\r\nphilosophical and educational subjects. His personality was magnetic and\r\ncommanding, but it was combined with a frank and fatherly attitude\r\ntoward his students which won their immediate and life-long friendship.\r\nBorn at Rhinebeck on the Hudson, of mixed Dutch and Huguenot ancestry,\r\non April 18, 1805, he came to Michigan in time to give his best years to\r\nhis new work. Many of his friends may well have been astonished at his\r\nacceptance of a post in a tiny college far on the outskirts of a village\r\nin the Western wilderness, which carried with it the munificent salary\r\nof $1,500, together with a house and an additional $500 for traveling\r\nexpenses. Yet he came. The principles of the University agreed with the\r\nideals he had received in his long study of European methods and his\r\npersonal experiences in German schools. He determined to make a real\r\nuniversity in the West; he fixed his glance upon the opportunities for\r\nfuture development rather than the bareness and inevitable crudity of\r\npioneer life. For the first time he found his cherished ideas embodied\r\nin the provision for a state university; and though he realized they had\r\nnot been made effective, he believed that in the West, if anywhere, was\r\nhis opportunity to put them into actual practice, unhampered by the\r\ntraditions which had grown up everywhere in the East.\r\n\r\nThe new President, in the first catalogue issued under his\r\nadministration, let the world know in no uncertain terms what the\r\nUniversity was to become as long as his was the guiding hand. He traced\r\nthe succession of state schools up to and through the University, where,\r\nhe declared, it was his purpose \"to make it possible for every student\r\nto study what he pleases, and to any extent he pleases.\"\r\n\r\nSome of his proposed measures must be regarded as prophecies for the\r\nfuture; they could hardly have been taken seriously at the time. They\r\nare not all realized even now; but they show the breadth of his\r\nconception of a real university. He emphasized openly the correspondence\r\nbetween the Michigan and the German systems of education, and declared\r\nthat;\r\n\r\n     It is the cardinal object to make this correspondence as complete\r\n     as possible. Hence, it is proposed to make the studies here pursued\r\n     not only introductory to professional studies, and to studies in\r\n     the higher branches of science and literature, but also to embrace\r\n     such studies as are more particularly adapted to agriculture, the\r\n     mechanic arts, and to the industrial arts generally. Accordingly, a\r\n     distinct scientific course has been added, running parallel to the\r\n     classical course, extending through the same term of four years,\r\n     and embracing the same number of classes with the same\r\n     designations.\r\n\r\nThese ideas he put into practice at once and Michigan became the first\r\nuniversity in the country to introduce practical scientific courses\r\nwithin the regular arts curriculum, and, following Harvard by only a few\r\nyears, was the second university in the country to break away from the\r\naccepted hard and fast course in which the humanities were the beginning\r\nand the end of education, acknowledging the claims of science by\r\ngranting the degree of Bachelor of Science. He was likewise a pioneer in\r\nother ways; for the University was the first to recognize the needs of\r\nspecial students who, while not seeking a degree, were anxious to pursue\r\nstudies in special subjects.\r\n\r\nPresident Tappan was wise enough not to seek the establishment of his\r\ngrand object at once, but he did announce in that first catalogue that\r\nhe proposed--\r\n\r\n     at as early a day as practicable, to open courses of lectures for\r\n     those who have graduated at this or other institutions, and for\r\n     those who in other ways have made such preparation as may enable\r\n     them to attend upon them with advantage.\r\n\r\nHere was the germ of a Graduate School, though for many years the\r\nlectures were more in evidence in the catalogue of the University than\r\nin the class room. He was sufficiently practical to realize that the\r\ncollegiate course, \"with its schoolmaster methods and discipline,\" of\r\nhis time must be retained for a period, though he aimed eventually to\r\ntransfer its work to the high school, gradually swinging the University\r\nto \"true university methods, free and manly habits of study and\r\ninvestigation.\" He also aimed to gather about him a Faculty in which\r\nevery chair was filled by a man of exceptional ability and thorough\r\ntraining, \"not a picked up, but a picked out man,\" to quote Professor\r\nFrieze in his Memorial Address on Dr. Tappan.\r\n\r\nThese are the cardinal principles which guided Michigan's first\r\nPresident throughout his career in the University, and, as ideals, have\r\nbeen a powerful factor in its growth since his time. More apparent to\r\nhis contemporaries were the immediate benefits of his strong\r\nadministration. He saw at once the urgent need of more funds for the\r\nlibrary and obtained a subscription from Ann Arbor citizens of some\r\n$1,515, to which the Regents added $300, resulting in an increase of\r\n1,200 volumes. From that time dates the steady and consistent growth of\r\nthe University Library. Even more pressing appeared to him the need for\r\nan astronomical observatory. From the very day of his inauguration, he\r\nmade the raising of sufficient funds for this purpose one of his first\r\ntasks and so effective were his efforts that the Observatory was opened\r\nin 1855; the result of a gift of $15,000 by citizens of Detroit, to\r\nwhich the University had added an appropriation of $7,000. This gave\r\nMichigan one of the three well-equipped observatories in the country at\r\nthat time. The telescope, a thirteen-inch objective, was purchased in\r\nthis country, but other items of equipment were obtained in Berlin under\r\nthe advice of Professor Encke, the Director of the Royal Observatory,\r\nwhose assistant, Dr. Bruennow, came to America as Michigan's first\r\nProfessor of Astronomy.\r\n\r\nIt was during Dr. Tappan's administration also that the professional\r\ndepartments, as they were long called, came into their own. The Medical\r\nSchool had been organized since 1849, when the first building was\r\ncompleted at a cost of about $9,000; but the work was only fairly under\r\nway when he came. The new department was opened in October, 1850, with\r\nninety matriculates and grew with extraordinary rapidity, so that for\r\nthe first years the enrolment exceeded that of the Literary Department.\r\nWhen Dr. Tappan left the University in 1863 there were 252 students in\r\nthe Medical Department and by 1866-67 their number increased to 525, the\r\nlargest enrolment in the history of the School. The creation of a Law\r\nDepartment was considered at the same time the Medical Department was\r\norganized, but lack of resources as well as any enthusiastic support\r\nfrom the legal profession in the State postponed its opening for ten\r\nyears. The growing number of petitions for its establishment, however,\r\nfinally led to the opening of the School in 1859 with a Faculty of\r\nthree, and ninety-two students. Hardly less important was the\r\nestablishment in 1855 of a course in civil engineering. It was organized\r\nin connection with the Department of Physics, however, and did not\r\nattain to the dignity of a separate department with its own head for\r\nmany years. Even so modest a beginning as this for technical courses in\r\nthe University found precedent in those days only at Harvard. Lack of\r\nfunds and co-operation from the Legislature seems to have been the only\r\nreason which led to the abandonment of plans for the creation of\r\ndepartments of Agriculture and Military Science which were seriously\r\nconsidered at that time.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of these different schools was all a part of Dr.\r\nTappan's scheme for the development of a true university. Though he\r\ndeplored their necessarily lowered requirements, he saw the day when\r\nthey would be graduate departments, as in effect the Law and Medical\r\nSchools are in the way of becoming now, at least insofar as they require\r\na minimum of two years' work in the Literary College before the student\r\nis permitted to enter upon his professional studies. They formed, as it\r\nwas, with the various scientific courses established in the Literary\r\nDepartment, a significant departure from the single \"cast iron\" course\r\nof the Eastern colleges. By very reason of this innovation Michigan, in\r\nPresident White's words, \"stands at the beginning of the transition of\r\nthe old sectarian college to the modern university.\"\r\n\r\nIn all this President Tappan's influence was vital. He entered\r\nwhole-heartedly into the life of the University, displaying a remarkable\r\nshrewdness and charity in his dealings with the students, and\r\nsympathizing heartily with the work of every professor. One of his\r\nstudents, Byron M. Cutcheon, '61, afterward a Regent of the University,\r\nthus describes him:\r\n\r\n     As I remember him, he was fully six feet tall, with a grand head\r\n     set upon massive shoulders. A full suite of dark brown hair, worn\r\n     rather long and considerably disordered, crowned and adorned his\r\n     head. His face ... was pleasant and attractive though never\r\n     exhibiting levity, and rarely, humor. The nose was large and\r\n     somewhat Roman. The rather long side beard had not yet turned gray.\r\n     His carriage was upright and dignified. I never saw him in a hurry.\r\n     He was always approachable, but never familiar nor invited\r\n     familiarity.\r\n\r\nThe powerful frame and compelling presence of Chancellor Tappan are well\r\nportrayed in the magnificent bas-relief by Karl Bitter, now in Alumni\r\nMemorial Hall, a fitting tribute to his influence upon the University on\r\nthe part of his former students. Especially noteworthy is his\r\nrepresentation here with his favorite mastiff, \"Leo,\" his inseparable\r\ncompanion. No reminiscence of a student of that time is complete\r\nwithout mention of \"Leo\" and his later companion \"Buff,\" an only\r\nslightly less huge animal acquired during the later years of Dr.\r\nTappan's administration. So when, in the popular air of the sixties, his\r\nstudents asked:\r\n\r\n    \"Where, O where, is Dr. Tappan?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was:\r\n\r\n    \"He went up on Buff and Leo,\r\n    Safe now in the Promised Land.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Tappan was not fortunate in his appearances before the State\r\nLegislature to ask for appropriations. He was too good a speaker not to\r\ncommand a hearing, but his repeated references to the German prototypes\r\nof the University were resented; while the opposition of the smaller\r\nchurch colleges, who represented the unsectarian character of the\r\nUniversity as \"Godless,\" was very evident in the indifferent and even\r\ndiscourteous attitude of the individual members of the Legislature.\r\nFinally President Tappan became disgusted and as he left, never to\r\nreturn, he made the memorable prophecy: \"The day will come, gentlemen,\r\nwhen my boys will take your places, and then something will be done for\r\nthe University.\" Within a decade this began to come true, but not in\r\ntime to save to the University the services of Dr. Tappan.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the University's greatest misfortunes that her first\r\nPresident was not permitted to work out his plans. The story of his\r\nremoval is a sad one, though fortunately the issues were largely\r\npersonal and did not involve fundamental University policies. When Dr.\r\nTappan came to Michigan he found the Faculty and Regents entirely ready\r\nto co-operate with him; glad, in fact, to have a strong hand at last at\r\nthe helm. The Board sympathized with his ideals and the Faculty seconded\r\nhim loyally in all his efforts. This happy state of affairs continued\r\nfrom 1852 to 1858, when, in conformity with the constitutional provision\r\nof 1850, a new Board of Regents succeeded the one which had chosen him\r\nas President. This Board was not only entirely new, but it was composed\r\nof men who lacked what would seem to be the elementary qualifications\r\nfor such a task; in fact, few if any of them had had any academic\r\ntraining whatever. Nevertheless this did not in the least embarrass\r\nthem, and they proceeded at once to take a very active part in\r\nUniversity life. It soon became evident that there was a great\r\ndifference between their views as to the duties of the President, and\r\nthose of Dr. Tappan, who assumed that, as executive officer, his\r\nauthority in the internal affairs of the University and over the Faculty\r\nwas, under certain limitations, comprehensive and effective. He could\r\nnot see how the University could properly develop otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe new Regents, on the contrary, seemed to feel that not only the\r\nadministration of the University finances but a great share of the\r\nlegislative and administrative power rested with them; and they\r\nproceeded to act upon that assumption. They prepared a set of rules for\r\nthe conduct of the University without consulting President Tappan, and\r\nappointed a series of executive committees which seriously limited his\r\ncontrol. Certain of the Regents were particularly aggressive, especially\r\nLevi Bishop, the Detroit member of the Board, who for a long period\r\nwrote anonymous articles on the University in a Detroit paper, giving\r\nhis biased view of all that happened in the Regents' meetings. The Ann\r\nArbor Regent, Donald MacIntyre, whose banking office became the\r\nunofficial center of University affairs, also proved himself unfriendly\r\nto the President.\r\n\r\nThe Faculty, unfortunately, was divided in its sympathies. It may be\r\nsaid that Dr. Tappan possessed the defects of his qualities. He showed a\r\ncertain lack of fellowship and understanding in dealing with some of his\r\nassociates and assumed, perhaps unconsciously, an air of authority and\r\nan attitude of superiority which was resented. Where his pre-eminent\r\nposition was unquestioned, as in his relations with the students and\r\nwith the people of the State, the charm and graciousness of his manner\r\nand his parental kindness won him universal friendship and respect.\r\nMoreover Dr. Tappan was courageous, generous, and direct in all his\r\ndealings, in spite of that touch of condescension. He insisted strongly,\r\nhowever, on what he regarded as his prerogatives and exhibited a certain\r\nlack of diplomacy and forbearance in dealing with the Regents and\r\nFaculty, which under ordinary circumstances would have been regarded as\r\nthe personal idiosyncrasy of a great man. But with a majority of the\r\nRegents definitely opposed to him from the first and with a growing\r\nFaculty cabal in support, it weighed heavily against him. His every\r\naction was criticized. Though he was a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed\r\nChurch, and was affiliated with the Presbyterian church in Ann Arbor, he\r\nemphasized the University's non-sectarian character, and paid no\r\nattention to the denominational affiliations of the candidates in making\r\nappointments to the Faculty. He carried this policy so far that he took\r\nno active part in the affairs of his own church in Ann Arbor, a course\r\nwhich was resented by the Presbyterians, while it won him no friends in\r\nthe other churches which he attended impartially. His European habit of\r\nserving wine at his table also was severely censured, particularly by\r\nthe local Regent, who was a Presbyterian and a strong prohibitionist.\r\nFinally, his efforts to maintain a high standard in the Faculty by\r\nholding in subordinate positions men who had not proved their ability\r\ndid not increase the number of friends among his colleagues.\r\n\r\nA change was anticipated in 1864, when a new Board of Regents offered\r\npromise of a different order. Dr. Tappan therefore, in spite of many\r\ntemptations to resign, continued to hold his position, largely because\r\nof the appeals of his friends, particularly students and alumni, to\r\n\"stick it out.\" But certain members of the old Board, it was said, had\r\nstated that they would bring about his removal before the end of their\r\nterm. The event proved their intention, for the retiring Board, on June\r\n25, 1863, without warning, and only giving him a few hours to offer his\r\nresignation, summarily removed him from the offices and duties of\r\nPresident and Professor of Philosophy. At the same meeting Dr. Tappan's\r\nson was also removed from the position of Librarian, which he had held\r\nmost successfully for some years, while Dr. Bruennow, who had married his\r\nonly daughter, was dismissed from the Professorship of Astronomy, where\r\nhe had contributed so much to the reputation of the University. The\r\nBoard then elected to the Presidency and the Professorship of Rhetoric\r\nand English Literature Dr. Erastus O. Haven, who had served as Professor\r\nof Latin, and later of History and English Literature, from 1852 to\r\n1856, and who had afterward been engaged in the publication of a\r\nreligious paper of the Methodist Church in Boston. Dr. L.D. Chapin,\r\nAmherst, '51, pastor of the Ann Arbor Presbyterian church, who was among\r\nthose considered for the Presidency, was elected to the Professorship\r\nof Moral Philosophy.\r\n\r\nDr. Tappan never returned to Michigan. He spent the rest of his life in\r\nEurope and died in Vevey, Switzerland, in 1881. He had come to Ann Arbor\r\nwith high hopes, the fulfilment of a desire to take part in the\r\n\"creation of an American University deserving the name,\" and his\r\ndisappointment and disillusionment was a crushing blow. His spirit still\r\nlived, however, in the institution he loved and served, for we know now\r\nthat no man has had so large a share as he in shaping the course the\r\nUniversity was to take or insuring a proper direction of the first\r\nsteps. When he came he found a small struggling college of 222 students;\r\nwhen he left there were 652 students in three flourishing departments\r\nand the beginning of a real University. Were he alive today he would\r\nrealize that his great work was not in vain. The earnest invitation of\r\nthe Regents that he be the honored guest of the University at the 1875\r\nCommencement, which was declined because of failing health, must have\r\nsoftened bitter memories, particularly as the message of acknowledgment\r\nincluded a statement renewing the invitation for the following year and\r\nincorporated a resolution erasing all criticism from the Regents'\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nThe situation which faced his successor was a delicate one. The removal\r\nof Dr. Tappan had created a storm which grew rather than decreased, and\r\nPresident Haven found an unfriendly community and a hostile student body\r\nawaiting him. Every effort, in fact, was being made to secure the\r\nre-election of Dr. Tappan as soon as the new Board of Regents was in\r\nauthority. President Haven, however, who had known nothing of the\r\ncircumstances which led to the removal of Dr. Tappan when he accepted\r\nthe Presidency, showed great wisdom and tact in this emergency. He won\r\nthe respect of every one by an announcement that he did not intend to\r\nstay unless re-elected by the new Board, and appealed for harmony and\r\ngood feeling in the face of what was to all a difficult situation. At\r\ntheir first session the new Board of Regents considered the recalling of\r\nDr. Tappan. Floods of letters had been received from alumni, students,\r\nand friends of the University, advocating such action, but the Regents\r\nfelt that this course would be unwise as it would have involved\r\npractically a reorganization of the whole Faculty. The personal\r\ncharacter of the trouble which resulted in the removal of Dr. Tappan,\r\nemphasized later by an injudicious statement issued at the suggestion of\r\nsome of his friends, would have rendered such a course almost\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nDr. Haven was not a man of the powerful caliber of his predecessor but\r\nhe proved a most satisfactory administrator during a trying period. Of a\r\nmore conservative temper, he devoted himself to caring for the immediate\r\naffairs of the University rather than the problems of future\r\ndevelopment. He was born in Boston, November 1, 1820, and was graduated\r\nfrom Wesleyan University in 1842. After a few years spent in teaching,\r\nhe entered the ministry of the Methodist Church, but resigned in 1852 to\r\naccept the professorship of Latin in the University. Like his\r\npredecessor, he had an extraordinary ability as a speaker, though he was\r\nmore given to epigrams and felicities of expression, with which his\r\nspeeches fairly sparkled. His characteristic humor, quoted by Professor\r\nWinchell in his Memorial Address, is illustrated by the following\r\npassage:\r\n\r\n     Might not a parasite on the back of an ox ... having found out by\r\n     actual measurement the circumference of the ox, and by\r\n     mathematical calculation, the diameter of the ox, and having\r\n     ascertained that as he inserted his proboscis into the hide of the\r\n     animal, say the sixteenth of an inch, it gradually and regularly\r\n     grew warmer, infer, in like manner (as the geologist) that the\r\n     center of the animal was red hot lava!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY PHILIP TAPPAN, LL.D.

(1820-1881)\r\nPresident of the University, 1863-1869]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY SIMMONS FRIEZE (1817-1889)\r\nProfessor of Latin, 1854-1889\r\nActing President of the University, 1869-1871, 1880-1882]\r\n\r\nDr. Haven, in spite of his active denominational ties, was a strong\r\nsupporter of the non-sectarianism of the University. \"I maintain,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that a State University in this country should be religious. It\r\nshould be Christian without being sectarian,\" and again, \"Those\r\nquestions upon which denominations differ--however vital they may\r\nappear--should be left to their acknowledged teachers outside the\r\nUniversity.\"\r\n\r\nIn his general policy he faithfully followed the paths which had been\r\nlaid out for the University's development; and despite predicted\r\ndisaster he saw a great increase in her material welfare and her\r\nstanding in the academic world during the six years he was President.\r\nWithin four years the attendance practically doubled from 652 in 1862-63\r\nto 1,255 in 1866-67. This was due to the great and somewhat\r\ndisproportionate growth of the two professional schools, which were now\r\nwell under way, and to the reaction following the falling off of\r\nstudents during the Civil War. In 1864 a School of Mines was announced,\r\nbut it did not prove successful and was soon absorbed in a Department of\r\nMining Engineering which in turn failed to survive. In 1867-68 a Latin\r\nand Scientific course was established, substituting modern languages for\r\nGreek as cultural studies, an innovation which speedily proved popular\r\nand widely imitated. A course in Pharmacy was first given in 1868,\r\nthough it did not become a Department for some years. The Library also\r\ngrew from 13,000 volumes in 1864 to 17,000 in 1869, including one gift\r\nto the law library of 800 volumes. Other gifts increased the scientific\r\nresources of the University.\r\n\r\nThis growth in students and in the scope of the curriculum made\r\nadditions to the buildings and equipment imperative. The Medical\r\nBuilding was enlarged by a new section, erected at a cost of $20,000,\r\none-half of which was raised by the townspeople of Ann Arbor by general\r\ntaxation; while an addition to the Observatory and its general\r\nrenovation cost $6,000, an expense again defrayed by Ann Arbor and\r\nDetroit citizens. A much needed addition to the Chemical Laboratory was\r\nalso made, and one of the dwelling houses on the Campus was made into a\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nThe financial situation during most of this period, however, was\r\nthreatening. The great increase in the cost of living which followed the\r\nCivil War was making existence difficult for the whole University. The\r\ntotal income was but $60,000, while the average professor's salary was\r\nonly $1,500. Up to this time the State had contributed nothing to the\r\nUniversity for its support, aside from the loan made in 1838, though it\r\nwas glad enough to bask in the reputation which the great and growing\r\ninstitution brought to the Commonwealth. The University, in fact, had\r\ngrown beyond its resources, and something had to be done. The Regents\r\naccordingly took the University's case to the Legislature, which\r\ngranted, in 1867, a tax of one-twentieth of a mill on each dollar of the\r\ntaxable resources of the State, yielding a prospective income of about\r\n$16,000 annually--provided, however, that a Professor of Homeopathy be\r\nappointed in the Department of Medicine and Surgery.\r\n\r\nThis actually proved worse than nothing, for it increased tenfold the\r\ndifficulties of the University and precipitated a long and violent\r\ndiscussion which nearly disrupted the Medical Department. The Regents\r\nwere not compelled to take the money; so they postponed action and\r\nsought to evade the issue by proposing to establish a Department of\r\nHomeopathy in some other place than Ann Arbor. But this was held illegal\r\nby the Supreme Court and the matter was again postponed. At the end of\r\ntwo years, partly at least as a result of President Haven's masterly\r\nstatement of the University's plight before the Legislature, a new law\r\nwas finally passed giving the University not only an annual subsidy of\r\n$15,500 for the two ensuing years, but granting also the sum that had\r\naccumulated for two years as a result of the first Act. Thus was the\r\nUniversity saved once more. The Board was not only enabled to bring the\r\nUniversity's facilities into correspondence with its rapid growth; but\r\nmore to the point, it could now increase the salaries of the Faculty so\r\nthat full Professors in the Literary Department at last received the\r\n$2,000 originally provided in 1837. This relief was of the utmost\r\nimportance. Still more significant was the fact that a new policy was\r\ninaugurated by which the necessity of state support for the University\r\nwas recognized; support which has never since been withheld, for the tax\r\nwas successively increased to one-sixth of a mill in 1893, to one-fourth\r\nin 1899, and finally in 1907 to the present three-eighths of a mill. At\r\nlast Michigan, in the fullest sense of the term, became _the_ University\r\nof the State of Michigan.\r\n\r\nThis was the culmination of President Haven's administration. A few\r\nweeks later he resigned to accept the Presidency of Northwestern\r\nUniversity, a school maintained by his own denomination, where he\r\ndoubtless felt there were wider opportunities in his chosen field. His\r\nresignation was accepted by the Regents with regret and the declaration\r\nthat the success of the University during the preceding six years \"to a\r\nlarge extent had been due to his learning, skill, assiduity, and eminent\r\nvirtues,\" a statement which was given added force by an unsuccessful\r\nattempt to have him return during the interregnum of two years that\r\nfollowed. He died in Salem, Oregon, August 2, 1881.\r\n\r\nThe Regents were not able at once to find a successor to President\r\nHaven, so Professor Henry S. Frieze, who held the chair of Latin, was\r\nappointed Acting President. This position he filled so successfully for\r\ntwo years that he was asked informally whether he would accept the\r\nPresidency. The choice, however, fell in turn upon Professor Julius H.\r\nSeelye of Amherst College and President James B. Angell of the\r\nUniversity of Vermont, both of whom visited Ann Arbor but afterward\r\ndeclined the appointment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the good fortune which led to the selection of Dr. Frieze as\r\nActing President was shown by two important measures which were the\r\noutstanding features of his administration. For many years there had\r\nbeen a growing sentiment in favor of the admission of women to the\r\nUniversity, which had been steadily resisted by the students, Faculties,\r\nand Regents. President Haven had come to see its inevitability,\r\nparticularly in a state institution, and perhaps its advisability, but\r\nsuccessive discussions had only postponed action from year to year. So\r\nit was not until January 5, 1870, that the great step was taken in the\r\nfollowing innocuous resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Board of Regents recognize the right of every\r\n     resident of Michigan to the enjoyment of the privileges afforded by\r\n     the University, and that no rule exists in any of the University\r\n     statutes for the exclusion of any person from the University who\r\n     possesses the requisite literary and moral qualifications.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TWO MAIN BUILDINGS OF THE UNIVERSITY ABOUT 1860\r\n(From an old photograph)]\r\n\r\nGreat was the opposition, particularly from students and Faculties. The\r\nMedical Department was especially concerned and even organized an\r\nelaborate duplication of courses with an increase of $500 in\r\nprofessorial salaries, measures which later proved unnecessary. One\r\nmonth later, on February 2, 1870, the first woman was enrolled in the\r\nUniversity; Miss Madelon L. Stockwell, now Mrs. Charles K. Turner of\r\nKalamazoo. She was the only woman student until the fall term, when\r\neleven others entered the Literary Department, three the Department of\r\nPharmacy, eighteen the Department of Medicine, and two the Department of\r\nLaw, with four graduating the following June. Tradition has it that they\r\nhad a hard time at first. They were treated with indifferent courtesy,\r\ncollege journalism had its fling at them, many boarding places were not\r\nopen to them, and in fact life was made as unpleasant as possible. But\r\nthey had good friends in the President and in many members of the\r\nFaculties; they asked no favors, and they gained the education on a\r\nmasculine plane they sought. The experiment proved successful, as the\r\nroster of Michigan alumnae will show; and it was not long before\r\nco-education became the rule in all American colleges save the older\r\ninstitutions of the East.\r\n\r\nMichigan now, as we have seen, was a state institution in reality as\r\nwell as in name; but the educational arch of which she was the keystone\r\nwas not yet completed. The earlier close connection between the\r\nUniversity and the schools of the State, contemplated when the branches\r\nwere established, had proved impossible of realization, and the union\r\nhigh schools which soon succeeded them were tied to the University only\r\nincidentally and indirectly through the influence of such teachers as\r\nhad been students at the University. Their graduates came in increasing\r\nnumbers, it is true, but they were admitted by examination upon the same\r\nbasis as the graduates of any school.\r\n\r\nThe Acting President saw the need of a closer relationship, which would\r\nnot only strengthen the high schools, but would relieve the University\r\nof its elementary courses by eventually making the high schools the\r\nequivalent of the German Gymnasia; in effect the present junior\r\ncolleges, the establishment of which we are now witnessing in all the\r\nlarger high schools. Professor Frieze therefore proposed that special\r\nfaculty committees be sent to examine the character of the work in the\r\nhigh schools of the State. If this were approved, a certificate stating\r\nthat a proper preliminary course was satisfactorily completed, would\r\nadmit any student to the University without examination. This simple\r\nplan was severely criticized by some educational authorities of the time\r\nas revolutionary and as a lowering of standards. It soon justified\r\nitself, however, and has come to be the general practice; in fact, it\r\nhas also been extended to cover a reciprocal arrangement on the part of\r\nall the leading state universities as well as many of the privately\r\nendowed institutions. Again Michigan led the way.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the University continued undiminished, and soon the need\r\nof a large auditorium became increasingly apparent, to say nothing of\r\nmore offices and class rooms. The Legislature therefore voted in 1869\r\nthe sum of $75,000 for the erection of the present main section of\r\nUniversity Hall lying between the two original wings, the first\r\nbuildings of the University. This included a large auditorium, seating\r\nnearly 3,000 persons, with a chapel and the necessary offices and\r\nrecitation rooms on the first floor. The tower, which was the striking\r\nfeature of this building, was replaced in 1898 by the lower and much\r\nsafer dome of the present time.\r\n\r\nThe ability and success with which Dr. Frieze had conducted the affairs\r\nof the University was publicly recognized by the Board of Regents at the\r\nend of his term, and it was on his advice that the invitation was once\r\nmore extended to his former pupil at Brown University, Dr. James B.\r\nAngell; this time with successful results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT ANGELL AND PRESIDENT HUTCHINS\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Angell, fresh from his work in the East as Professor of Modern\r\nLanguages at Brown University, war-time editor of the _Providence\r\nJournal_, and President of the University of Vermont, came to Michigan\r\neight years after the departure of President Tappan. The Faculty of\r\nthirty-five which greeted him was a brilliant company, though small in\r\ncomparison with a roll over ten times as long when he resigned his\r\noffice. The catalogue of 1871 shows 1,110 students in the University at\r\nthat time; at the end of his term of office there were 5,223. The\r\nthirty-eight years of his administration not only covered a significant\r\nperiod in the history of American education but it was as well a\r\ncritical time in the life of the University. In the years between 1871\r\nand 1909 the University showed, once for all, that the experiment\r\ninvolved in its establishment, the popularization of education and the\r\nmaintenance of a school system and a university by the State, was not\r\nonly justified but even more, it was extraordinarily successful.\r\n\r\nWhile the University might have developed much as it has without the\r\nguidance of President Angell, it may be questioned whether it would have\r\nbeen as effective as a leader in the new movement. The principles which\r\nunderlie the state university system were stated well by the founders,\r\nwho incorporated the fundamental idea of popular education in the first\r\nconstitution of the State, and Michigan's first great President,\r\nChancellor Tappan, tried his best to make them practical. But he was\r\nahead of his time, and it was not until President Angell took the helm\r\nthat there was progress towards a true University. When he came Michigan\r\nwas still in many respects little more than a collection of colleges. It\r\nwas the work of Dr. Angell to build, and to build well, upon foundations\r\nalready laid; to harmonize, with practical idealism and diplomacy, the\r\nadvanced ideals of the University with the slower progress of the\r\nCommonwealth. While it has come to be no reproach upon the fame of Dr.\r\nTappan that he failed in just this particular, it is the great\r\nachievement of Dr. Angell that he succeeded. He made Michigan the model\r\nfor all succeeding state universities.\r\n\r\nThe new President was born in Scituate, R.I., January 7, 1829, of good\r\nNew England stock. Throughout his youth he lived the simple life of a\r\ncountry boy, attending the village school, the academy of one Isaac\r\nFiske, a Quaker pedagogue,--until he was ready for more advanced studies\r\nat the academies of Seekonk, Mass., and North Scituate.\r\n\r\nThis early training, in his later estimation, furnished the best\r\npossible instruction, because it involved personal attention from\r\nspecial instructors, a good old-fashioned method which the rapid\r\ndevelopment of this country has made almost impossible, yet a practice\r\nfor which he stood consistently as far as possible throughout his whole\r\ncareer as an educator. In speaking of his early schooling he said that\r\n\"no plan had been marked out for me; being fond of study and almost\r\nequally fond of all branches, I took nearly everything that was taught,\r\nmerely because it was taught.\"\r\n\r\nHis health as a boy, however, was delicate, giving small promise of his\r\nhale and hearty fourscore years, and he spent perforce two years, from\r\nfourteen to sixteen, on a farm. As to the value of this experience, far\r\nfrom uncommon in the lives of many men eminent in the history of this\r\ncountry, he said, \"I prize very highly the education I received then. I\r\nlearned how much backache a dollar earned in the field represents.\" He\r\nprepared for Brown University at a \"grammar school\" in Providence, where\r\nhe studied under Henry S. Frieze, destined to become his immediate\r\npredecessor in the Presidency of Michigan. He was graduated from Brown,\r\nwith highest honors, in 1849.\r\n\r\nThis early New England training was particularly fortunate for one who\r\nwas to come into such close relationship with the pioneer settlers of\r\nMichigan,--New Englanders to a very large extent. Equally fortunate was\r\nhis later training. His first residence abroad, where he acquired the\r\nfamiliarity with modern languages which fitted him for his first\r\nprofessorship, had been preceded by a year as assistant in the library\r\nat Brown University; then he became tutor, and later a student of civil\r\nengineering in the office of the city engineer of Boston. In fact, he\r\nspent this period to such advantage that later, upon his return from\r\nEurope, he was given the choice of a professorship either in civil\r\nengineering or modern languages, an evidence of the wide range of his\r\ninterests. He finally chose modern languages as his subject, and entered\r\nupon his career as a teacher, where he developed the highest\r\nqualifications. He remained at Brown for seven years.\r\n\r\nMany articles and reviews published in the _Providence Journal_\r\njustified his selection in 1860 as the editor of that paper, a position\r\nwhich he held throughout the Civil War with singular distinction.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, Dr. Angell was offered the Presidency of the University of\r\nVermont, and he accepted it. He took charge of the University when its\r\nfortunes were at a low ebb, and the future was not bright. It was due\r\nto the administrative ability of the new President as well as to his\r\nripe experience and culture that the day was saved and Vermont\r\nprospered, intellectually and financially, during the five years of his\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nOf his decision to come to Michigan, Dr. Angell said twenty-five years\r\nlater: \"While, with much embarrassment, I was debating the question in\r\nmy own mind whether I should come here, I fell in with a friend who had\r\nvery large business interests, and he made this very suggestive remark\r\nto me: 'Given the long lever, it is no harder to lift a big load than it\r\nis with a shorter one to lift a smaller load.' I decided to try the end\r\nof the longer lever.\"\r\n\r\nJames Burrill Angell was inaugurated President of the University of\r\nMichigan in June, 1871. From that time his life was the life of the\r\nUniversity except for interludes of diplomatic service in China, Turkey,\r\nand upon various commissions. His diplomatic career, though only\r\nincidental to his life work as an educator, showed that he possessed the\r\nnecessary qualifications for what might well have been a very\r\ndistinguished career in other fields. At the time of his appointment to\r\nChina as Minister Plenipotentiary, diplomatic relations in the East were\r\ndecidedly indirect and characteristically Oriental. It had just taken\r\nGermany two years to conclude a rather unimportant commercial treaty,\r\nand upon his arrival at Peking his colleagues in the diplomatic service\r\nlaughed at him for supposing that his one year's leave of absence would\r\nsuffice for his far more important mission. Yet the revision of the\r\nBurlingame treaty, restricting the importation of cheap coolie labor\r\ninto this country, which he sought, was accomplished within two months.\r\nAnother important commercial treaty relative to the importation of\r\nopium was likewise completed at the same time. He was also successful in\r\nhis mission to Turkey in 1898 and as a member of the Alaska Fisheries\r\nand other international commissions.\r\n\r\nBut his heart was in his work at Ann Arbor, and thither he always\r\nreturned despite flattering temptations to enter diplomatic life. A\r\ngreat opportunity lay before him when he took up his new duties and he\r\nrecognized it. It was his task to bring the State, exemplified in\r\nparticular by a not always sympathetic Legislature, and by a Board of\r\nRegents of continually varying complexion, to a realization of the true\r\nfunction of a university supported by the State. He must arouse the\r\nenthusiasm for education and learning which he knew lay deep in the\r\nhearts of the people of Michigan. As Professor Charles Kendall Adams,\r\nlater President of Cornell and Wisconsin, said: \"What was called for\r\nfirst of all was the creation and dissemination of an appreciative\r\npublic opinion that would produce, in some way or other, the means\r\nnecessary for the adequate support of the University.\" So well did Dr.\r\nAngell accomplish this purpose that of late years he loved to dwell, in\r\nhis speeches before the alumni, upon what he chose to call the \"passion\r\nfor education\" on the part of the people of the State, forgetting\r\nutterly the yeoman service he performed all his life toward bringing\r\nabout that same regard for popular education.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the foundation and declaration of the educational ideals\r\nof the West cannot be ascribed to him. Nevertheless he must be regarded,\r\nmore than any other one man, as the successful pilot who avoided the\r\ndifficulties which the very novelty of the situation presented. The\r\ncomparative freedom from precedent offered an unrivaled opportunity to\r\ntry new theories in education, and was a continual temptation to try\r\npolicies which must have proved too advanced for the place and the time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALUMNI MEMORIAL HALL]\r\n\r\nA survey of the educational system in the West at the time he came to\r\nMichigan may be of interest. As regards the number of students, quality\r\nof work, and the eminence of the men upon her Faculties, Michigan stood\r\nfar in advance of other state institutions. This very pre-eminence,\r\nhowever, threw a greater responsibility upon the new President. Lacking\r\nprecedents, he had to make them for himself, so that the place of the\r\nstate university in the educational world today is in great degree the\r\nmeasure of success he had in dealing with the practical problems which\r\nconfronted him throughout his extraordinarily long term of office. When\r\nhe came to Michigan there was only one other state university of any\r\nsize, Wisconsin, although several others had already been established.\r\nAccording to the report of the United States Commissioner of Education\r\nfor 1871, none of them except Michigan, and possibly Wisconsin, were in\r\nanything like a flourishing condition. While Michigan had, all told,\r\n1,110 students, of whom 483 were in the Literary Department, Wisconsin\r\nhad only 355, omitting a preparatory department of 131 students.\r\nMinnesota had but 167 students with 144 in the preparatory department,\r\nwhile Kansas enrolled 313. No figures were given for Illinois, which was\r\nthen the Illinois Industrial University, and Nebraska, both of which had\r\nbeen established for several years.\r\n\r\nYet Michigan, although she was well in the lead in point of numbers as\r\nwell as in the strength of her professional schools, was far from\r\nrealizing her possibilities. It would, of course, be a rash assertion to\r\nsay that she has realized them now. But it is safe to say that no state\r\nhas maintained more truly the type of the well-rounded university, a\r\nlarge college of liberal arts, with traditions of culture and\r\nscholarship which began with its very foundation, surrounded by a ring\r\nof effective professional schools.\r\n\r\nTwo years after he came the present system of revenue from the State was\r\nfirst made operative. This came in the form of an annual proportion of\r\nthe state taxes, fixed at first at one-twentieth of a mill on every\r\ndollar of taxable property; a proportion which continued for twenty\r\nyears. Since then it has been increased several times until it is now\r\nthree-eighths of a mill on every dollar; it netted the University in\r\n1909, the last year of his administration, $650,000 instead of the\r\n$15,000 of 1873. The total income of the University for that year was\r\n$1,290,000 as against $76,702.52 received during his first year.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps on the more strictly academic side of the development of\r\nthe University that Dr. Angell's peculiar genius as an administrative\r\nofficer was most apparent. When he came, he was forty-two years of age,\r\nand in Professor Hinsdale's words, \"brought to his new and responsible\r\npost extended scholarship, familiar acquaintance with society and the\r\nworld, administrative experience, a persuasive eloquence, and a\r\ncultivated personality.\" This urbanity and extraordinary ability as a\r\nspeaker won for him from the first a place in the hearts and in the\r\nimaginations of the people of the State. But the most vital\r\nadministrative task which faced him was to make Michigan a true\r\nuniversity as distinguished from a college. He had to correlate and\r\nconcentrate the various departments, and make them complete by making a\r\nplace for effective graduate work. Certain revolutionary measures, such\r\nas the admission of women, the first tentative steps toward free\r\nelection of studies, the introduction of a scientific course, had been\r\ninstituted by his immediate predecessors; it became his duty to make\r\nthem a success.\r\n\r\nAlmost contemporaneous with Dr. Angell's inauguration as President was\r\nthe introduction of the seminar system of teaching, in effect a further\r\napplication of the foreign methods; not only should the teacher be an\r\ninvestigator and searcher after truth, but the student as well; and more\r\nimportant still, the student should be taught how to carry on original\r\ninvestigation himself by means of seminar classes where student and\r\nteacher worked together on original problems.\r\n\r\nWith all these innovations under way, Dr. Angell found many other\r\nopportunities for the introduction of new ideas in education--some of\r\nthem as startling and as revolutionary as certain of the earlier\r\nexperiments. These included a modification of that traditional course of\r\nclassical studies, which can be traced back directly to the Middle Ages.\r\nThe establishment of the Latin and Scientific Course, which dropped the\r\nrequirement of Greek, was the first step; this was carried further in\r\n1877 by the establishment of an English course in which no classics were\r\nrequired. The scientific course also underwent further modifications\r\nduring this year (1877-78), which was characterized by many changes\r\nregarded then as radical, though they do not strike one so nowadays. A\r\nstill more revolutionary step was taken by throwing open more than half\r\nthe courses to free election, permitting some students to shorten their\r\ntime in college, and enabling others to enrich their course with other\r\nthan the prescribed studies, heretofore compulsory and admitting of\r\nalmost no variation.\r\n\r\nAll these changes resulted in an immediate increase in attendance,\r\nalmost 20 percent the first year they went into force. As a direct\r\nresult of Dr. Angell's recommendation the first chair in the Science and\r\nthe Art of Teaching in any American university was established in 1880,\r\ncoming as a necessary corollary to the intimate relation maintained and\r\nencouraged by the University between itself and the high schools of the\r\nState. In 1891 this department was empowered to grant certificates\r\npermitting any student possessing one to teach in any high school in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe Graduate School practically came into being during his\r\nadministration, as there was really nothing worthy of the name of\r\ngraduate work before, in spite of the heroic efforts of President\r\nTappan. It was established as part of the Literary Department. When he\r\nfirst became President both the Law and Medical Schools consisted of two\r\ncourses of lectures of six months' duration, with no severe examination\r\nrequired for admittance. At present they require three and four years of\r\nnine months each, as well as two years of work in the Literary College.\r\n\r\nPresident Angell's administration, however, was by no means all smooth\r\nsailing. The question of finances, for one thing, was always with him,\r\nparticularly during his first years, when deficits were regularly\r\nreported and as regularly taken care of by special appropriations of the\r\nLegislature. The situation became particularly acute in 1879 and as a\r\nresult the scale of salaries for the President and the Faculty was\r\nreduced materially, in the President's case from $4,500 to $3,750. The\r\nincrease in the value of money following the panic of 1873 was given as\r\nan excuse for this action.\r\n\r\nQuestions of student discipline also disturbed these early years. The\r\neternal rivalry between the Freshmen and Sophomore classes, with its\r\nattendant rushes and hazing episodes, was growing stronger every year,\r\nuntil in the fall of 1873 the report that thirty freshmen had been\r\n\"pumped,\" a more or less self-explanatory term, stirred up enemies of\r\nthe University throughout the State. In April, 1874, three freshmen and\r\nthree sophomores were suspended for hazing. This aroused the student\r\nbody. The two classes concerned met at once and some eighty-four\r\nstudents signed statements that they were equally guilty. The Faculty,\r\nafter giving these students a week of grace to withdraw their names,\r\nfinally suspended eighty-one of the signers.\r\n\r\nTwo problems which arose in connection with the Medical School also\r\nproved most embarrassing. Throughout the history of the University there\r\nhas been a disposition on the part of some members of the medical\r\nprofession to advocate the removal of the school to Detroit. This\r\nquestion first arose in 1858 and was definitely settled at that time in\r\nfavor of a united University. The matter came to the fore once more in\r\n1888 when it was proposed to move only the clinical instruction to\r\nDetroit. Dr. Angell took a vigorous stand in opposition and by a careful\r\nand well-reasoned statement of the case convinced the Regents of the\r\ninexpediency and impracticability of such a measure. Though echoes of\r\nthis project are even now heard occasionally, Dr. Angell's masterly and\r\ndiplomatic course at this time assured, apparently once for all, the\r\nintegrity of the University in Ann Arbor. Two members of the Medical\r\nFaculty, however, were so committed to the program for removal that they\r\ncontinued the agitation until their resignations were requested by the\r\nRegents the following year.\r\n\r\nA further difficulty arose over the establishment of a Department of\r\nHomeopathy, which had long been the subject of agitation. The Regents\r\npostponed action from year to year and refused to appoint two\r\nProfessors of Homeopathy in the Department of Medicine as directed by an\r\nact of the Legislature. In this course they were sustained by the\r\nCourts. But in 1875 the Legislature authorized the establishment of a\r\nHomeopathic Medical College and made a permanent appropriation of $6,000\r\nfor its support. The Board then gave in and proceeded to organize the\r\nCollege, to the great concern of the members of the regular Medical\r\nFaculty, many of whom were threatened with professional ostracism, since\r\nthey were expected to give several preliminary courses to the students\r\nin the new college. The venerable Dr. Sager, who was then Emeritus\r\nProfessor, even thought it necessary to resign all connection with the\r\nUniversity. Though for a few years the position of the medical men was\r\ndifficult, the situation eventually adjusted itself as the new\r\nDepartment grew.\r\n\r\nThe most trying period of Dr. Angell's long administration, however,\r\nwere the years from 1875 to 1879, when a comparatively trifling\r\ndiscrepancy in the books of the Chemical Laboratory developed into a\r\nstruggle which almost disrupted the University. The story of the\r\ntrouble, which is generally known as the Douglas-Rose controversy, is\r\ntoo long to be told here. In its beginning it was a bit of carelessness\r\non the part of Dr. Douglas, the director of the Chemical Laboratory, in\r\nchecking over the accounts of his assistant Dr. Rose. The latter was\r\ncharged with petty defalcations over a long period of years, involving\r\neventually a total of $5,000. Dr. Douglas was an Episcopalian, Dr. Rose\r\na Methodist, and the friends and fellow churchmen of the two men rallied\r\nto their support. The Board of Regents became sharply divided. Political\r\ninfluence was used and the State Legislature became involved through an\r\ninvestigating committee which, after a long session, reported in favor\r\nof Dr. Rose, who had in the meantime been dismissed from the University.\r\nDr. Douglas was then likewise dismissed.\r\n\r\nThe University finally brought suit against the two men for the recovery\r\nof the laboratory deficit, which resulted in fixing Dr. Rose's liability\r\nat $4,624.40, eventually covered by a one-half interest in the\r\nBeal-Steere Ethnological Collection, offered by Mr. Rice A. Beal and Mr.\r\nJoseph B. Steere, '68, afterward Professor of Zooelogy. Dr. Douglas was\r\ncharged with the balance of about $1,000, which, however, was\r\npractically covered by sums which had been advanced by him for\r\nUniversity and laboratory expenses. Eventually Dr. Rose was reinstated\r\nas a result of continued agitation, though his connection with the\r\nUniversity was not for long; while Dr. Douglas, by a decision of the\r\nSupreme Court, to which the case was carried, was completely exonerated;\r\na number of the initials on the disputed vouchers were pronounced\r\nforgeries, and some $2,000 and heavy costs were returned to him by the\r\nUniversity. This was officially the end of perhaps the greatest period\r\nof disturbance in the University's history, a struggle which was in\r\nevery way a loss, in prestige and internal unity even more than\r\nfinancially. That the growth and development of the institution\r\ncontinued almost unabated through these years proves the fundamental\r\nstrength and momentum attained by the University in less than forty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBut neither the successful handling of such administrative problems as\r\nare suggested in the preceding paragraphs, or even the improvement in\r\nthe equipment and personnel of the University, represent rightly the\r\nreal work of President Angell. His greatest influence lay in his\r\ndealings with the students, and through them, upon the educational\r\nideals of the West. And it is precisely this influence, quietly acquired\r\nand characteristically wielded, that represents what is perhaps his\r\ngreatest claim upon the consideration of the future. No one who had the\r\nprivilege of hearing him speak failed to respond to the quiet\r\npersuasiveness of his presence and the charm of his personality. There\r\nare some persons in whom is inherent a certain magnetic mastery over\r\nnumbers. He had this to an extraordinary degree. Merely by rising he\r\ncould bring absolute stillness upon a cheering throng of students or\r\nalumni, and with a few words, quiet but distinct, he could rouse to a\r\nremarkable pitch that sentiment known as college spirit. His whole\r\nfigure was expressive of a benign goodness, illuminated most humanly by\r\nthe worldly wisdom of an old diplomat. His ability to deal with those\r\nwho came to him on various errands was remarkable. This is amusingly\r\nillustrated by the experience of one man who went to him to present his\r\nclaims for an increase in salary. His memories of the interview were\r\nmost delightful but exceedingly hazy as to the matter in question. His\r\nonly distinct impression was that the interview ended with himself on\r\nthe door-mat earnestly discussing Ticknor's \"History of Spanish\r\nLiterature\" with his host, who had shown him to the door.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter years of his life Dr. Angell published a book of\r\nreminiscences which was most favorably received and widely noticed. One\r\nwell-known journal, however, remarked that it was rather \"naive,\" a\r\ncriticism which greatly delighted the man who had met the diplomats of\r\nChina and Turkey on their own ground and defeated them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES BURRILL ANGELL, LL.D. (1829-1916)\r\n  President of the University, 1871-1909\r\n  (From a copyright photograph by A.G. Gowdy)]\r\n\r\nMany honors came to Dr. Angell in the course of his long life, as was\r\ninevitable. His scholarship was universally recognized. He received\r\nthe degree of LL.D. from Brown University in 1868, Columbia University\r\nin 1887, Rutgers College in 1896, Princeton University in 1896, Yale\r\nUniversity in 1901, Johns Hopkins University in 1902, the University of\r\nWisconsin in 1904, Harvard University in 1905, and the University of\r\nMichigan in 1912. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society\r\nof Philadelphia, the American Antiquarian Society of Worcester, the\r\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences of Boston, and the American\r\nHistorical Association, of which he was president in 1893. Dr. Angell\r\nwas a charter member of the American Academy at Rome. For many years he\r\nwas also Regent of the Smithsonian Institution at Washington. He was\r\nalways a leader in the Congregational Church and presided at the\r\nInternational Congregational Council which met in Boston in September,\r\n1899. This body was composed of delegates from all parts of the world\r\nand represented the scholastic and ecclesiastical organization of the\r\nchurch in the persons of its most distinguished members.\r\n\r\nAll through his career, Dr. Angell gave evidence of certain\r\ncharacteristics which had definite effects upon his policy as President.\r\nProfessor Charles H. Cooley, '87, has characterized the especial\r\nqualities which made for his success as \"his faith and his\r\nadaptability.\" Dr. Angell always believed in the tendency of the right\r\nto prevail, and was willing to wait with a \"masterly inactivity,\"\r\navoiding too much injudicious assistance. He was always able to maintain\r\na broad and comprehensive view, the attitude of the administrator, and\r\nwas faithful in his belief in the Higher Power which guides the destiny\r\nof men--and universities. His diplomatic genius, the combination of\r\nteacher and man of the world, enabled him to keep in close and\r\nsympathetic touch, not only with the student life about him, but also\r\nwith the difficult problems of an ever-growing Faculty. He always showed\r\nhimself surprisingly shrewd, yet withal charitable, in his judgments of\r\nmen and their character, a qualification which enabled him to follow a\r\n_laissez-faire_ policy until the proper time. Often his penetration and\r\ninsight, in analyses of current problems and questions, which might be\r\nsupposed not to interest so particularly a man of his years, surprised\r\nhis young associates and gave evidence of the wonderful vitality, the\r\nspirit of youth, which lived within him.\r\n\r\nAnn Arbor was long accustomed to his familiar figure on his invariable\r\nmorning constitutional, walking with an elastic, springy step and a\r\nruddy freshness in his complexion which almost belied his gray hairs and\r\nhis well-known age. He passed few blocks without a word to some one, for\r\na simple, kindly interest in those about him was one of his chief\r\ncharacteristics. It was his essential democracy which kept him for so\r\nmany years in personal relations with his students, an interest which\r\nnever flagged until the last, and which was shown by the close track\r\nwhich he always kept of the alumni of the University. For the alumni, he\r\nalways bore that simplest and most beloved of academic titles, \"Prexy.\"\r\nNo gentler tribute has ever been paid than the words of his former\r\npupil, Professor Charles M. Gayley, '78, now of the University of\r\nCalifornia, in the Commemoration Ode, read at the Quarter Centennial of\r\nDr. Angell's Presidency:\r\n\r\n    \"For he recks of praises nothing, counts them fair nor fit:\r\n    He, who bears his honors lightly,\r\n    And whose age renews its zest--\"\r\n\r\nTo James Burrill Angell must be given a pre-eminent place among those\r\nwho have made advanced learning for the young people of the land a\r\nmatter of course. More than any other one person he helped to give to\r\nthis country one of her proudest distinctions, the highest percentage in\r\nthe world of college men and women.\r\n\r\nPresident Angell's long administration of thirty-eight years came to an\r\nend October 1, 1909, when he resigned what had become a heavy burden to\r\nbecome President-Emeritus. Even now we cannot properly estimate how\r\ndistinguished that service was. He was then eighty years old and had\r\ngiven the University the best that was in him. The death of his wife,\r\nSarah Caswell Angell, in 1903, was a blow from which he never recovered.\r\nShe was the daughter of President Alexis Caswell of Brown University,\r\nand her sympathetic co-operation and especial interest in the women of\r\nthe University was no small factor in his success.\r\n\r\nFor seven years after his resignation he lived in the home on the Campus\r\nhe had so long occupied, loved and honored alike by students, Faculty,\r\nand alumni; and watched with interest and appreciation the development\r\nof the University under the new leader. Here he died on April 4, 1916.\r\nNo tribute to a great leader was ever more fitting than the long double\r\nfile of students that lined the whole way to Forest Hill on the day he\r\nwas laid to rest under the simple monument which marks his grave.\r\n\r\nNo effort was made immediately to find a successor. Dean Harry Burns\r\nHutchins of the Law School, who had once before served as Acting\r\nPresident during Dr. Angell's absence in Turkey, was asked to act again\r\nin that capacity. This he did so successfully that on June 28, 1910, he\r\nwas unanimously elected to the Presidency. He accepted, but upon the\r\ncondition, expressed in his letter of acceptance, that he serve but five\r\nyears. The new President assumed his duties when the tide of the\r\nUniversity's progress was at the ebb. It is no disparagement of his\r\npredecessor to say that for some years the affairs of the University had\r\nbeen allowed to take their course with little aggressive action; his\r\nperiod for vigorous measures had passed. There was much therefore that\r\nneeded to be set in order in the academic establishment and to this the\r\nnew executive set himself immediately.\r\n\r\nPresident Hutchins is the first graduate of the University to become its\r\nPresident, for he received his degree in 1871 at the same time Dr.\r\nAngell delivered his inaugural address. He was born at Lisbon, New\r\nHampshire, April 8, 1847, and came to Michigan in 1867, the year he\r\nentered the University. After his graduation he was for one year\r\nSuperintendent of the Schools of Owosso, Michigan, after which he\r\nreturned to the University as instructor in history and rhetoric,\r\nbecoming Assistant Professor in 1873, a position he held for three\r\nyears. In the meantime, however, he had been preparing himself for the\r\npractice of the law and in 1876 resigned his academic duties to enter\r\nactive practice in Mt. Clemens. He was recalled to the University in\r\n1884 as Jay Professor of Law, a position which he held so ably that when\r\nthe trustees of Cornell University were looking for a man to organize a\r\nlaw department four years later their choice fell upon him. This work he\r\nundertook and completed with great success, remaining Dean of the\r\nCornell Law School for seven years. In 1895 he was once more recalled to\r\nhis alma mater as Dean of the Department of Law, a position he resigned\r\nto become the fourth President of the University.\r\n\r\nFor this task he was peculiarly fitted, not only through his previous\r\nexecutive experience and his intimate knowledge of the University, but\r\nalso by those qualifications which had made him so long a leader in the\r\nFaculties of the University. An unusually dignified presence and\r\nsomewhat judicial manner only conceal a rare simplicity, directness, and\r\nkindliness revealed to every one with whom he comes into personal\r\ncontact. He has the rare qualification of a real and sincere interest in\r\nthe affairs of those with whom he is dealing, and the kindly sympathy,\r\ninvariably shown toward every one with whom the wide range of his duties\r\nbrings him into contact, inspires universal respect and affection, even\r\nfrom those who have on occasion disagreed with his policies. Moreover,\r\nhe is always ready to listen with open mind on any subject, willing to\r\nbe convinced, and what is more to act quickly upon conviction. Emphatic\r\nin stating and enforcing his conclusions once they are reached, he is\r\nalways careful of others' opinions.\r\n\r\nIt is not yet the time nor have we the perspective to view adequately\r\nPresident Hutchins' administration. It has been a period in Michigan's\r\nhistory as distinct in most respects as those of his predecessors. While\r\nhe followed the academic traditions established in former\r\nadministrations he devoted himself particularly to the unification and\r\nco-ordination of the University as a whole, to the establishment of the\r\nnecessary financial support on a firmer and more adequate basis, and to\r\nthe cultivation of more intimate relations with the alumni. Though his\r\ninfluence in the academic life of the University has perhaps never been\r\nso personal and compelling as that of his predecessors, largely because\r\nthe rapidly increasing numbers of students and Faculties alike make the\r\nclose relationship of an earlier era impossible, the University has not\r\nonly marched in the ways long established, but has grown and expanded\r\nunder his sympathetic guidance and with the momentum of her past, until\r\nshe has come at last to fill in, in great part, the slender lines of the\r\nsketch made by President Tappan and the early fathers. This is no small\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nThe policy first inaugurated in President Angell's time of requiring a\r\ncombined course in the Literary College and the Medical School for all\r\nmedical students was extended during President Hutchins' time to the Law\r\nSchool and the Homeopathic Medical School, while the course in the\r\nCollege of Pharmacy was increased to three years and in the College of\r\nDentistry to four years, with an ever-increasing emphasis on the\r\ndesirability of preliminary work in the Literary College. These\r\nmeasures, though warmly advocated by the respective Faculties, did not\r\ncome without opposition. The tendency of the time was unmistakable,\r\nhowever, and the University has been strengthened accordingly. Other\r\nsignificant actions taken during President Hutchins' administration were\r\nthe establishment of many special courses leading to degrees such as\r\nPublic Health, Aeronautical Engineering, and Municipal Administration,\r\nand special curricula in Sanitary, Automobile, and Highway Engineering,\r\nFine Arts, and Business Administration. The special summer courses in\r\nLibrary Methods were introduced just before he took office, and have\r\nbecome an important part of the summer curriculum. It is also not amiss\r\nto note that the first three women to hold Professorships in the\r\nUniversity were appointed in 1918.\r\n\r\nIt was also during President Hutchins' administration that the present\r\neffective University Health Service came into being. This resulted from\r\na series of recommendations made by a committee of students which were\r\npresented to the Regents in November, 1912. These were immediately\r\napproved and by October, 1913, three University physicians, including\r\none woman, undertook the systematic care of the health of the student\r\nbody. At present the staff includes four doctors, besides two nurses and\r\nassistants, who give their whole time to this important work. The\r\nService is maintained in its own building, a remodeled dwelling house at\r\nthe rear of Hill Auditorium, where a free dispensary is open five hours\r\ndaily. Prescriptions are filled at the Health Service Pharmacy in the\r\nChemistry Building, while provision for the care of seriously sick\r\nstudents is made at the University Hospitals ordinarily at no expense to\r\nthe student. The cost of the maintenance of this service is supported by\r\na small charge included in the annual fees.\r\n\r\nNot the least of the many effective measures taken during President\r\nHutchins' administration was the establishment of the Graduate School as\r\na separate department of the University. For many years it had been\r\nmaintained as a part of the Literary College, or Department, as it was\r\nthen, and was administered by a committee appointed from the Literary\r\nFaculty. This anomalous position of the graduate work in the University\r\neventually gave rise to suggestions for a change from many different\r\nsources, particularly from the Research Club, an organization of many of\r\nthe leading men in all the Faculties, which came to the attention of the\r\nPresident when he took up his new duties. He at once recognized the\r\ndesirability of enlarging the scope of advanced study and it was with\r\nhis active co-operation and hearty support that the new School was\r\ncreated with Professor K.E. Guthe as its first Dean.\r\n\r\nThe growing cordiality between the University and the other educational\r\ninstitutions of the State is a significant development of late years.\r\nThis is evidenced by the establishment with several of them of combined\r\ncourses, which enable their students to pursue a portion of their\r\npreliminary work in the smaller school. This spirit of co-operation has\r\nalso been most effectively advanced through the creation by the\r\nUniversity of a series of State College Fellowships with a stipend of\r\n$300 each, to be held each year by especially chosen graduates from each\r\nof ten colleges in Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of extension courses, with the aim of bringing the\r\nUniversity into a closer relationship with the people of the State, has\r\nalso come as the result of the recognition by President Hutchins of the\r\nreal need of such co-operation. Starting at first from a desk in his own\r\noffice, from which members of the Faculty were sent to deliver lectures\r\nbefore various bodies about the State, the work speedily grew into a\r\nDepartment under the charge of Professor W. D. Henderson, '04, as\r\nDirector. At the present time several special courses in literature,\r\nhistory, philosophy, and economics, corresponding exactly to similar\r\ncourses given in the University are offered in various cities of the\r\nState, as well as three hundred lectures by different members of the\r\nFaculty. In addition the University has undertaken the training of\r\nteachers of industrial subjects under the Congressional provision known\r\nas the Smith-Hughes Bill, which provides for the training of teachers in\r\nagriculture, industrial subjects, and home economics. For its share in\r\nthis work the University receives annually, partly from the Government\r\nand partly from the State, the sum of $24,000. This work is carried on,\r\nnot only at the University, where it is under the charge of Professor\r\nGeorge E. Meyers, Ottawa College, '96, but in Detroit and Grand Rapids\r\nas well as other extension centers, under charge of special Professors\r\nof Industrial Education.\r\n\r\nLikewise the cordial relations between the University and the high\r\nschools of the State have developed consistently as is sufficiently\r\nshown by the appropriation of $300,000 made by the 1919 Legislature for\r\nthe establishment of a demonstration school for the training of students\r\nwho are preparing themselves as high school teachers.\r\n\r\nThe University under President Hutchins was thus particularly happy in\r\nits relations with the people of the State. This is especially true of\r\ntheir representatives in the Legislature. From time to time he laid\r\nbefore them the needs of the University so effectively that we now have,\r\nlargely as the result of his efforts, the series of buildings erected\r\nrecently, including the Natural Science Laboratory, the heating plant,\r\nand the new Library, probably the best arranged and most convenient in\r\nits appointments in the country, as well as the projected University\r\nHospital, to cost eventually $2,000,000, and the Demonstration School.\r\nIn addition he secured from the Legislature in 1919 an appropriation of\r\n$350,000 to cover the deficit due to the extraordinary war-time\r\nexpenditures, when the cost of everything was doubled and the income\r\nfrom fees materially lessened, and even more important, an additional\r\n$350,000 for two years to cover an increase in Faculty salaries. This\r\nitem was later superseded by an increase in the valuation of the\r\nproperty in the State, made by the State Board of Equalization, which\r\nadded over $600,000 to the annual income of the University. Thus was the\r\nUniversity saved from what easily might have been a disastrous situation\r\narising from the threatened loss of many members of the Faculty. No\r\nevent of recent years is of more fundamental importance than this\r\nmaterial aid which came to the institution at so critical a period.\r\n\r\nNo less important and encouraging in their promise for the future have\r\nbeen the gifts of the graduates which have resulted in no little measure\r\nfrom President Hutchins' efforts to stimulate the interest and support\r\nof the alumni. The former students of the University have been bound to\r\ntheir alma mater as never before; they have been brought to see that it\r\nis their responsibility and privilege to aid the University in many ways\r\nimpossible to the taxpayer. The Hill Auditorium, the Martha Cook\r\nBuilding, the Newberry and Betsy Barbour Halls of Residence for women\r\nand the Michigan Union, to which over 14,000 alumni have contributed\r\nover a million dollars,--a record perhaps unparalleled in any\r\nuniversity,--to say nothing of scores of other benefactions, are\r\nexamples of this new spirit on the part of the alumni which President\r\nHutchins has done so much to foster. The continued increase in enrolment\r\nfrom 5,343 in 1909 to 7,517 in 1916-17, with a total of 9,401 in\r\n1919-20, is also an evidence of the effectiveness with which the\r\nUniversity has continued to perform its mission, though this continued\r\ninflux of students brings with it responsibilities and difficulties\r\nwhich have taxed the physical resources, and the ability of the\r\nFaculties. Happily the increase in income granted in 1919 is an augury\r\nof a better era, if the growth for the next few years is not too\r\noverwhelming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARRY BURNS HUTCHINS, LL.D.\r\n  President of the University, 1909-1920\r\n  (From a copyright photograph by J.F. Rentschler)]\r\n\r\nPresident Hutchins desired to resign the Presidency in 1914, at the end\r\nof the term fixed by him in his letter of acceptance, but the Regents\r\nwere unanimous in their desire to have him remain in office. He again\r\nasked to be relieved of the duties of the office in 1916, but once more\r\naction was postponed and it was not until March 12, 1919, that his\r\nresignation was finally accepted with the regret of the Regents, who\r\nexpressed \"their sincere appreciation of his wise, efficient, and\r\ndevoted services in behalf of the University.\" This was to take effect\r\nJune 30, 1919. The Board thereupon took immediate steps to secure a\r\nsuccessor to President Hutchins, but were at first unsuccessful, and\r\nonce more prevailed upon him to remain in office. This he consented to\r\ndo reluctantly and only because of his interest in the institution he\r\nhad served so long and faithfully, postponing yet another year his\r\nwell-earned rest.\r\n\r\nSeveral noteworthy celebrations have served to emphasize the\r\nUniversity's progress. Two of them marked her semi-centennial and her\r\nseventy-fifth anniversaries, comparatively brief periods, perhaps, when\r\ncontrasted with Harvard's celebration of her two hundred and fiftieth\r\nyear, shortly before Michigan signalized her fiftieth, but symbolizing\r\nnevertheless an extraordinary and impressive transformation; the\r\nprogress of a little backwoods college into one of the greatest of\r\nmodern Universities. This was the inspiration that underlay these two\r\noccasions, made peculiarly significant through the congratulations and\r\nmessages of good will borne by distinguished ambassadors from other\r\ninstitutions, and through elaborate memorials sent by the Faculties of\r\nEuropean Universities, to whom the University's accomplishment was a\r\ngreater marvel than it was to those more familiar with the conditions\r\nwhich had brought it into existence.\r\n\r\nThe fifth of June is the natal day of the University and therefore both\r\ncelebrations were most appropriately held during the Commencement Week\r\nof the anniversary years, 1887 and 1912. A Commemoration Oration, in\r\nwhich President Angell surveyed with wise sympathy and a just pride the\r\nUniversity's record was the special feature of the first celebration.\r\nSomewhat more ambitious was the seventy-fifth anniversary which took\r\nplace twenty-five years later. Owing to the fact that Hill Auditorium\r\nwas still unfinished, and the old University Hall was by no means large\r\nenough to shelter all who desired to attend, a special tent was erected\r\nnear the Gymnasium for the Commemoration Exercises. The Hon. Lawrence\r\nMaxwell, '74, of Cincinnati delivered the principal address, a review of\r\nthe University's history. The special guests and numerous\r\nrepresentatives from other universities were tendered a reception and\r\ndinner in the University Library, at which President Andrew D. White, of\r\nCornell, held the place of honor upon the program as a representative of\r\nthe University's earlier days. The whole celebration was in no small\r\npart a tribute to the two elder statesmen, Dr. Angell and Dr. White, who\r\nhad played so great a part in the drama of American education which the\r\noccasion symbolized.\r\n\r\nDr. Angell's own share in the history of the University was also marked\r\nby the celebration on June 24, 1896, of his twenty-fifth year of service\r\nas President. As was inevitable the exercises were a series of personal\r\ntributes to Dr. Angell, in which the congratulations and felicitations\r\nof Regents, Faculties, and teachers of the State were fittingly\r\nexpressed. A particularly graceful tribute was the \"Commemoration Ode\"\r\nby Charles M. Gayley, '78, of the University of California.\r\n\r\nOf an entirely different character was the great \"National Dinner,\"\r\ndesigned to celebrate the University's services to the Nation, held in\r\nthe ballroom of the Hotel Astor in New York, February 4, 1911. This was\r\none of the greatest alumni dinners ever held by any university, as\r\nthere were nearly eight hundred alumni present, including a large\r\ndelegation from the University, and from Detroit and Chicago, Mr.\r\nJustice William L. Day; '70, of the United States Supreme Court, and\r\nsome twenty-eight members of both houses of Congress. Earl D. Babst,\r\n'93, the general chairman of the committee in charge, acted as\r\ntoastmaster of this gathering, the spectacular character of which was\r\nemphasized, not only in the speeches, songs, and college yells, but also\r\nby a huge painting of the University Campus filling a good part of the\r\nwall above the speaker's table.\r\n\r\nOn December 29, 1919, it was announced that Marion LeRoy Burton,\r\nPresident of the University of Minnesota, was to become the fifth\r\nPresident of the University on July 1, 1920. This announcement was a\r\ngreat surprise, as his name was only one of many which had been\r\ndiscussed as a possibility by those interested, but the decision was\r\nmost favorably received by the University body and the alumni. The new\r\nPresident is a young man, but his record of accomplishment has great\r\npromise for the future. He was born in Brooklyn, Iowa, August 30, 1874,\r\nand was therefore forty-five years old at the time of his election. His\r\nearlier education was received in the schools of Minneapolis and at\r\nCarleton College, Northfield, Minnesota, where he was graduated with the\r\ndegree of A.B. in 1900. After some years spent in teaching he eventually\r\nentered the Yale Graduate School, where he received his doctorate in\r\n1907.\r\n\r\nTwo years later he was elected President of Smith College, but spent a\r\nyear in travel abroad before taking up his duties at Northampton. He\r\nremained at Smith until 1917, when he succeeded Dr. George E. Vincent as\r\nPresident of the University of Minnesota, the position he resigned to\r\naccept the Presidency of Michigan. He comes to his new task as did his\r\npredecessors, Dr. Tappan and Dr. Angell, with a vision for the future of\r\nthe University. He believes, as they did, that in the State University\r\nlies the future of education in this country, and Michigan, with her\r\nstrategic position between the East and the West, the prestige of her\r\nyears, the wide distribution of her students, and the proved loyalty of\r\nher great body of alumni, offered him a field which he could not well\r\nrefuse. He has before him the prospect of many years of service, for he\r\nis only three years older than was Dr. Angell when he first came to\r\nMichigan.\r\n\r\nDr. Burton was officially inaugurated President of the University on\r\nOctober 14, 1920. His formal acceptance of his office was made the\r\noccasion of a significant and stimulating educational conference, which\r\nlasted for three days. Some two hundred representatives of the leading\r\nAmerican Universities and educational bodies listened to the discussion\r\nof vital academic and administrative problems of the modern state\r\nuniversity during the five sessions, which covered the general topics;\r\n\"Educational Readjustments,\" \"Administrative Problems,\" and\r\n\"Constructive Measures.\" The inauguration banquet was held at the\r\nMichigan Union on the evening of October 15, 1920. President A. Lawrence\r\nLowell of Harvard, President E.A. Birge of the University of Wisconsin,\r\nPresident Harry A. Garfield of Williams College, and the Hon. Thomas E.\r\nJohnson, Superintendent of Public Instruction, were the speakers on that\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARION LEROY BURTON, LL.D.\r\nPresident of the University of Michigan, 1920-]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLITERATURE, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the University grew, the first Faculty of two members gradually\r\nincreased, though for years the roster was far from impressive. What\r\nthis first Faculty lacked in numbers, however, it made up in character\r\nand ability. One has only to read the whole-hearted and loving tributes\r\nof early graduates to discern the powerful personalities which inspired\r\nthem. It is true that for the most part they were scholars of an older\r\nschool, content to hand on the classical learning of the contemporary\r\ncollege course, rather than original investigators. But how well they\r\nperformed this task! They inspired a real enthusiasm and love of\r\nknowledge for its own sake in those they taught, and furnished them, as\r\nwell, an ideal for right living--all for five hundred dollars a year. We\r\nof a later generation cannot honor them too much.\r\n\r\nAbout these men, strongly individualized in the minds of their students,\r\nhave clustered stories which have become almost classic. Sharply\r\ncontrasted in particular characteristics, they have lived as vivid\r\npersonalities for future college generations in the memories of those\r\nstudents, \"who studied syllogisms under the noble Whedon, who polished\r\nGreek roots for the elegant Agnew, who bungled metaphysics to the\r\ndespair of the learned Ten Brook, who murdered chemistry under the\r\ncareful Douglas whose experiments never failed, and who calculated\r\neclipses of the moon from the desk of Williams, the paternal.\" This\r\ncharacterization by a member of the class of '49 is paralleled in a\r\nmore caustic estimate of a somewhat later Faculty by a member of the\r\nclass of '65 who speaks of \"Boise the precise, Frieze the effusive,\r\nWilliams the plausible, and White the thinker.\"\r\n\r\nAlways first in any reminiscences of the early days was Professor George\r\nPalmer Williams, the first real member of the Faculty, always known to\r\nhis students as \"Punky,\" possibly, as Professor D'Ooge suggested,\r\nbecause of the \"dryness of his wit.\" Freshmen were even known to address\r\nhim as \"Professor Punky,\" only to be pardoned with a never to be\r\nforgotten kindliness when they discovered their awful mistake. Professor\r\nWilliams was a graduate of Vermont (1825) and came to the University\r\nfrom the Pontiac branch to take the Professorship of Natural Philosophy.\r\nHe was especially loved, not only for his fatherly kindness and genuine\r\nsympathy that won the confidence of his students, but also because \"the\r\ncollege student pays unstinted admiration to a witty teacher, for no\r\nteacher ever had more ready wit and such genuine humor.\" The Rev.\r\nTheodoric R. Palmer of the class of '47, who for ten years was\r\nMichigan's oldest graduate, told how Professor Williams on discovering a\r\ngoose occupying his chair remarked: \"I see you have a competent\r\nteacher,\" and wished the class \"Good Morning,\" leaving them to discover\r\nthe point of their joke.\r\n\r\nProfessor Williams' strong religious spirit did not prevent an apt\r\nemployment of examples from the Scriptures on occasion, as his rebuke to\r\nan overgrown and too active freshman showed: \"Sir, you remind me of\r\nJeshurun; the Bible says 'Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked.'\" But in the\r\nclass room he was traditionally lenient. One student who found himself\r\nunable to fit his carefully prepared notes and the examination\r\nquestions together, finally handed them both in and was passed, but only\r\nbecause it was the \"wrong year\"; \"I condition one every other year and\r\nif I conditioned you I would have to have you again next year.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Williams served the University long and faithfully, and only\r\nresigned his active work in 1875. In 1876 the alumni established a\r\nWilliams Professorship Fund which eventually amounted to nearly $30,000.\r\nThis eased his last years until his death in 1881 at the age of 79\r\nyears. Although the fund was subsequently greatly lessened by very\r\ncareless administration, it now amounts to something over the original\r\nsum and is administered by the Regents in the form of a retiring\r\nallowance, the holder being nominated by the Alumni Association.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Joseph Whiting, Yale, '23, under whose charge was the classical\r\ntraining of the six youngsters of that first class, was a man of\r\ndifferent type. A fine scholar, he made Greek and Latin \"glow with life\r\nand beauty,\" and by his distinguished bearing formed a happy complement\r\nto the \"jovial and rotund\" Williams. His death while he was serving his\r\nterm as the annual President just before the first class was graduated,\r\nwas recognized as a great loss by the students, as well as by the\r\nRegents, who acknowledged \"his urbanity and gentleness of manners,\" and\r\n\"his knowledge of character and other properties which especially fitted\r\nhim to act the part of a governor and counselor of youth.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Douglass Houghton died during the same year, 1845. The\r\nservices of these two men, as well as those of Charles Fox, Professor of\r\nAgriculture, and Dr. Samuel Denton of the first Medical Faculty, are\r\ncommemorated by the little weather-beaten monument with the broken\r\nshaft, which has doubtless aroused the idle curiosity of thousands of\r\nstudents, who have never taken the trouble, however, to decipher the\r\nLatin inscriptions which set forth the life records of these early\r\nprofessors.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Dr. Abram Sager, a graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\r\n(1831), who later became the first Dean of the Medical Faculty, came to\r\nthe University as Professor of Zooelogy and Botany. He was then about\r\nthirty-two years of age and had for some time been connected with the\r\nState Geological Survey as botanist and zooelogist. His contributions to\r\nthe University while in that position formed the foundation of the\r\npresent zooelogical collection. One of his students speaks of him as \"of\r\nexceedingly sensitive mind and heart and of very high and pure\r\nmorality.\" A Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, the Rev.\r\nEdward Thomson, Pennsylvania, '29, was appointed in 1843, but served\r\nonly one year. He was succeeded by the Rev. Andrew Ten Brook, Madison\r\nUniversity, '39, who took a vigorous part in the University's life until\r\nhis resignation in 1851, not to return until 1864 as Librarian--and\r\nhistorian of the University's early days. Professor Ten Brook was of the\r\nBaptist persuasion, exceedingly well read, particularly in the\r\nliterature of his chair. Ordinarily in his classes he was master of the\r\nsituation, \"so long as he had Dugald Stewart's Metaphysics before him,\"\r\nbut when discussion became free in his classes and \"scholastics were let\r\nloose\" one of his thought students they \"got a little the better of\r\nhim.\" That he was a shrewd and honest observer with remarkably little\r\npersonal prejudice--even in memories of trying times, is shown by his\r\nbook on \"American State Universities\" which offers much that is\r\nfascinating to those interested in the first days of the University.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GENERAL VIEW OF THE FRONT OF THE CAMPUS\r\nShowing University Hall, including the old North Wing, with the Law\r\nBuilding in the background]\r\n\r\nIn the same year Silas H. Douglas, M.D., who studied at the\r\nUniversity of Vermont, was appointed assistant to Dr. Douglass Houghton,\r\nProfessor of Chemistry, Mineralogy, and Zooelogy, who never took up the\r\nactive duties of his chair. Dr. Douglas speedily became one of the\r\n\"strong men\" of the Faculty and created the Chemical Laboratory which\r\nlent so much prestige to Michigan in its early years. He was of a\r\nsystematic and orderly temperament whose experiments before the class\r\nalways came out brilliantly. His careful business-like methods were\r\ngreatly appreciated by the Regents and he was entrusted with the\r\noversight of the construction of the South College when it was erected\r\nin 1849. So successful was he that he saved some $4,000 over the cost of\r\nthe first building and had enough bricks left besides to build a large\r\npart of the Medical Building which was completed in the same year. Those\r\nwho knew him best supported him loyally in the great dispute which arose\r\nover his administration of the affairs of the Chemical Laboratory and\r\ntheir confidence in his uprightness and sterling integrity was justified\r\nby the final decision in that most unfortunate case.\r\n\r\nThese were the men who taught the first class that was graduated from\r\nthe University in 1845. The same year saw two additions to the Faculty,\r\nthe Rev. Daniel D. Whedon, Hamilton, '28, who was elected to the chair\r\nof Logic, Rhetoric, and History, and Dr. John H. Agnew, Dickinson\r\nCollege, '23, who assumed the Professorship in the classics left vacant\r\nby the death of Dr. Whiting. Both had a prominent share in University\r\naffairs for a few years. Professor Whedon was a Methodist clergyman,\r\nlank and angular in form and feature with a \"considerable sprinkling of\r\nvinegar at times in his ways of expressing himself,\" but, according to\r\nour oldest living graduate, \"his commanding presence, imperative logic\r\nand _sesquipedalia verba_, always used with mathematical precision,\r\nhammered truth into us and clinched it.\" Professor Agnew has been\r\ndescribed as a Greek from head to foot, the exact opposite of Dr.\r\nWhedon, extremely careful in his dress and appearance and\r\ncorrespondingly neat and precise in the expression of his thoughts. He\r\nrepresented the Presbyterian and Congregational element in the\r\nUniversity. The reasons for the resignation of these two Professors in\r\n1852 have already been suggested in the lack of unity and the sectarian\r\nrivalries of their time.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most picturesque figure of this early group was Louis\r\nFasquelle, the first Professor of Modern Languages, whose widely used\r\ntext-books contributed not a little to the prestige of the University.\r\nWhen he came in 1846, his chair was almost a new field in an American\r\ncollege. Only a single term in French was given at first and in fact\r\nneither he nor Dr. Sager, charged with the scientific course, were\r\nrequired to give their whole time to their university work for some\r\nyears. It is somewhat suggestive too, that both Spanish and Italian were\r\noffered in the University before a course in German was announced in\r\n1849. Professor Fasquelle was educated at the famous Ecole Polytechnique\r\nin Paris, but was obliged to leave France on account of his\r\nparticipation in the revolutionary movement of that period. As Professor\r\nin the University he proved \"peculiar, but very learned and efficient.\"\r\nThe stories of his difficulty with the English language are many, and\r\nmost of the classic stories told of various members of the French\r\nFaculty by successive student generations were originally told of him.\r\nHe was the first \"infiddle,\" though he was always punctilious in\r\nattendance at chapel, which he adjourned on one occasion because the\r\n\"praying Professor\" did not appear. His \"vocabul'-ary\" was good, but in\r\nthe words of the time-honored song, \"He went up on his emphas'-is.\"\r\n\r\nThe new regime of Dr. Tappan witnessed the establishment of a different\r\ntradition. The former deference to denominational precedent was\r\ndefinitely abandoned and increasing stress was laid upon scholarly as\r\nwell as personal qualifications. The new President took the chair of\r\nphilosophy left vacant by the resignation of Professor Ten Brook, while\r\nthe old chair of ancient languages was speedily divided. James R. Boise,\r\nBrown, '40, who already enjoyed a growing reputation as a scholar,\r\nbecame Professor of Greek, while the Rev. Erastus O. Haven, Wesleyan,\r\n'42, afterward the second President, became Professor of Latin.\r\nProfessor Boise though of a delicate physique possessed great force and\r\nimpressed the students with the absolute necessity of getting their\r\nGreek lessons, _ruat coelum_. His insistence on discipline and high\r\nstandards in recitations had a profound influence on the mental habits\r\nof those in his classes. Professor D'Ooge, '62, his successor, remarks\r\nof him that \"probably no teacher of those days got so much downright\r\nhard work out of his pupils.\" Alvah Bradish was also appointed to the\r\nchair of Fine Arts at this time, but without compensation, and, though\r\nhe apparently lectured occasionally, the course soon disappeared from\r\nthe catalogues, not to be revived for fifty years. The name of the Rev.\r\nCharles Fox also appears momentarily as a Professor of Agriculture, a\r\ndepartment also destined to quick extinction with his death in less than\r\na year, in spite of the President's best efforts, for the Legislature\r\nhad already taken the preliminary steps toward the establishment of a\r\nCollege of Agriculture at Lansing.\r\n\r\nThe strength of President Tappan's policy is shown in the group of men\r\nhe appointed to Professorships--leaders as well as scholars. Among the\r\nfirst was Alexander Winchell, Wesleyan, '47, whose versatility was shown\r\nby the range of his teaching as well as by his long list of published\r\nworks. He came to Michigan in 1853 as Professor of Physics and Civil\r\nEngineering, but within two years was transferred to the chair of\r\nGeology, Zooelogy, and Botany, which he held until his resignation in\r\n1873 to accept the Chancellorship of Syracuse University. He returned to\r\nMichigan in 1879 as Professor of Geology and Paleontology, and ended his\r\ndays in Ann Arbor in 1891. With a personality vigorous and powerful, if\r\nsomewhat unyielding, he was always a factor in faculty affairs, though\r\nhe was not so happy in his relations with the students as some of his\r\ncolleagues and therefore does not figure so prominently in their\r\nreminiscences. He has been described as a sober, earnest, eloquent,\r\nsometimes shrewd and witty but very absent-minded, scholar whose\r\n\"beautiful and even eloquent language led many to an admiration and love\r\nfor sciences.\" His work on the Michigan Geological Survey of which he\r\nwas twice director, and his life-long effort for the reconciliation of\r\nscience with religion, brought wide recognition to the University.\r\n\r\nA totally different personality was Dr. Henry Simmons Frieze, Brown,\r\n'41, who came to Michigan the next year as Professor of Latin Language\r\nand Literature, in place of Dr. Haven, who assumed the Professorship of\r\nHistory and English Literature. No name on Michigan's long Faculty roll\r\nhas been more honored than his. He brought to the University not only\r\nwell-grounded ideals of true scholarship, but also a broad culture, not\r\ntoo common in those days, and an inspiring interest in literature and\r\nart which left a deep impression. It was such spirits as Dr. Tappan, Dr.\r\nFrieze, and Andrew D. White, who was also of that early company, that\r\nset for the University standards in academic life and ideals which have\r\nnever been lost, and which enabled Michigan to take her place with such\r\nextraordinarily little delay as one of the country's great educational\r\nforces. Unhampered by the formalism and traditions of the Eastern\r\nuniversities of that time, these men found here an opportunity for the\r\nestablishment of the progressive methods of the better European\r\nuniversities. The services of Dr. Frieze as Acting President for the two\r\nyears preceding President Angell's election are mentioned elsewhere. He\r\nwas once more called upon to be Acting President during the year Dr.\r\nAngell was in China in 1881 and again for a few months in 1887. But\r\nthese were only interludes, for his influence during his long\r\nProfessorship, where he easily stood _primus inter pares_, must be the\r\ngauge of the high favor in which he was held by students and Faculty\r\nalike. Among the many facets of his genius was a remarkable ability as a\r\nmusician, and the impetus he gave the musical life of Ann Arbor resulted\r\nin the organization of the Musical Society and the naming of the Frieze\r\nMemorial Organ in his honor. Andrew D. White tells us, in his\r\n\"Autobiography,\" that he found him one of the most charming men he had\r\never met,--simple, modest, retiring to a fault, yet a delightful\r\ncompanion and a most inspiring teacher. \"So passionately was he devoted\r\nto music that at times he sent his piano away from his house in order to\r\nshun temptation to abridge his professorial work, and especially was\r\nthis the case when he was preparing his edition of Virgil. A more lovely\r\nspirit never abode in mortal frame. No man was ever more generally\r\nbeloved in a community; none, more lamented at his death.\" Hardly less\r\nimportant was the inspiration and support Dr. Frieze gave to the study\r\nof art through his contributions to the University's art museum. This\r\ndates particularly from a gift he made of books, engravings,\r\nphotographs, and copies of statues and paintings, purchased abroad in\r\n1856 with the unexpended balance of his salary, amounting to $800. This\r\nwas the real beginning of the University's art collection.\r\n\r\nThe same day in June, 1854, that witnessed the appointment of Dr.\r\nFrieze, saw the election of Dr. Franz F.E. Bruennow, a graduate of the\r\nUniversity of Berlin, as Professor of Astronomy and Director of the new\r\nObservatory. He too was destined to have a profound influence upon the\r\nfuture of the University though his years in Ann Arbor were\r\ncomparatively few. Dr. Bruennow had already gained a European reputation\r\nas a scientist before he decided to come to America, which he did\r\nlargely upon Humboldt's advice, and because of his desire to use the\r\nastronomical clock and meridian circle which were made in Berlin under\r\nhis direction for the new observatory in Ann Arbor. The long list of\r\ndistinguished astronomers who have been students at Michigan may be said\r\nto trace their academic lineage back to his acceptance of this position.\r\nHis successor, James C. Watson, was his pupil and Professor C.K. Adams\r\nin his memorial address on Professor Watson said: \"During the senior\r\nyear the Professor of Astronomy lectured to Watson alone. And I remember\r\nyears afterwards hearing Professor White say to one of his historical\r\nclasses that the best audience any professor ever had in this University\r\nwas the audience of Dr. Bruennow when he was lecturing to this single\r\npupil.\" Dr. White dwells with particular appreciation on the little\r\nmusical circle formed by Dr. Frieze, Mrs. White, and Dr. Bruennow, which\r\nmay well have been the original impulse for the future development of\r\nmusical interests in the University and the community. Dr. Bruennow's\r\nquiet simplicity, which led those \"who knew him best to love him, most,\"\r\nsometimes led to humorous situations, as on the occasion when President\r\nTappan requested Dr. Bruennow to find some one to take his place at\r\nmorning prayer the next day. This commission was performed with Teutonic\r\nliteralness, for each of the professors interviewed was greeted abruptly\r\nwith the somewhat startling question, \"Professor, can you _bray_?\" He\r\nreturned to Europe at the same time Dr. Tappan left the University, but\r\nhis influence remained in the work of his students and the scholarly\r\ntraditions he established.\r\n\r\nAndrew D. White, Yale, '53, came as Professor of History and English\r\nLiterature in 1857. His influence was only less vital than that of Dr.\r\nTappan and Dr. Frieze because his active service with the University was\r\nto last but six years. He was a very young professor, indeed--only\r\ntwenty-four--but he had had the best of training in France and Germany\r\nand was inspired by a vision of a chair of history alone, unencumbered\r\nby any allied, or supposedly allied, subjects; something apparently\r\nunknown elsewhere, certainly at Yale, his Alma Mater.\r\n\r\nHe tells with relish in his \"Autobiography\" of the attentions paid him\r\nby the students. As soon as they caught sight of him at the station they\r\nasked him if he were going to enter the University. Of course he was.\r\nThey immediately proceeded to \"rush\" him, not discovering that he was\r\nthe new Professor of History until he signed the hotel register. His\r\nstudents were often older than he was and his experiences were many,\r\nparticularly when he had it out with one student whom he had sized up as\r\na ring-leader in class disturbances. This man was always elaborately\r\ninnocent when trouble was brewing, but the young professor was sure he\r\nwas right in his suspicions as to the seat of the trouble. Finally he\r\ndelivered an ultimatum: \"I see either you or I must leave the\r\nUniversity.\" The student pleaded not guilty but Professor White\r\ninsisted, suggesting that the Regents might feel the same as he in the\r\nmatter. After some diplomatic passages, in which the student seemed not\r\nunimpressed by the importance given him, he acknowledged that perhaps he\r\nhad been a little foolish and suggested that they try to live together a\r\nlittle longer. He afterwards became a strong friend of the young teacher\r\nand later fell at the head of his brigade at Gettysburg.\r\n\r\nThe success with which Professor White and his contemporaries labored\r\namong their students is shown by his later statement that from among\r\nthem came senators, congressmen, judges, professors, lawyers, heads of\r\ngreat business enterprises, and diplomats. One became his successor in\r\nthe Professorship of History and later in the Presidency of Cornell, and\r\na well-known American historian of his time. Another became his\r\npredecessor in the Embassy to Germany. Professor White left Ann Arbor in\r\n1863, partly because of business interests, partly because of his\r\nelection to the New York State Senate and the Presidency of Cornell\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nWith these men as leaders Michigan boldly embarked on a series of\r\ndepartures from educational precedents. Though the time was not ripe for\r\ngraduate study, its desirability had been recognized emphatically in the\r\nannual catalogues. In their class rooms several of the Faculty\r\nendeavored to do more than follow the accepted textbooks, through\r\nlectures, assigned readings, and exercises designed to develop the\r\nindividual powers of each student. Professor White was particularly\r\nfertile in these expedients. The claims of comparatively new subjects,\r\nforeign to the traditional curriculum, were recognized in chairs of\r\nhistory, English literature, the modern languages, and above all the\r\nsciences, where true laboratory work was gradually introduced until\r\nMichigan had under Professor Douglas what was probably in its early\r\nyears the largest chemical laboratory in any American university. The\r\nnew scientific course, which was established within the Literary\r\nDepartment and not as a separate school, was particularly significant of\r\nthe progressive spirit of this early Faculty. This came to be so well\r\nrecognized that Dr. Angell remarked in his inaugural address that the\r\ndrift of intelligent opinion had been for twenty years towards some of\r\nthe positions early adopted by the University, such as elective studies\r\nand larger opportunities for the study of history, modern languages, and\r\nthe natural sciences. He also took occasion to suggest that the\r\nUniversity would always have to be in a measure dependent upon the\r\nalumni, since the Legislature would never become so generous in its\r\nappropriations as to make private gifts undesirable or unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWhile the liberal policy which laid the foundation for this expansion of\r\nthe University's field may properly be said to have been formed during\r\nPresident Tappan's administration, it was continued and wisely expanded\r\nunder his successors. President Haven's first years were difficult, but\r\nhe had the support of his colleagues and was fortunate in the\r\nappointment of the new members of the Faculty necessitated by the\r\nreorganization which ushered in his administration. One of the first of\r\nhis appointments was that of Dr. Bruennow's favorite pupil, James C.\r\nWatson, '57, to succeed him as Professor of Astronomy and Director of\r\nthe Observatory. Professor Watson's brilliant work had already\r\nattracted wide attention, he \"was bagging asteroids as though he lured\r\nthem with a decoy\" though he was at that time still a very young man,\r\nand his methods as a teacher somewhat peculiar. He paid scant attention\r\nto those not vitally interested in his subject, and, as one chronicler\r\nobserved, showed the folly of a set course of studies and contributed in\r\nthis way not a little to the eventual adoption of the elective system in\r\nthe University. His lectures were sometimes brilliant and always lucid,\r\nthough he was not exacting in recitations or in examinations. The story\r\nis told of his passing one student in an examination who had died\r\nearlier in the year; he had merely taken the name from the roll prepared\r\nthe first day of the semester. Whatever were Professor Watson's personal\r\nqualifications, however, the long list of eminent astronomers who were\r\nhis pupils during the years from 1863 to 1879 are ample evidence of his\r\ngenius, for they include such names as those of his successor Professor\r\nHarrington, '68, Otto J. Klotz, '72_e_, of the Observatory of the\r\nDominion of Canada, Monroe B. Snyder, '72, Director of the Philadelphia\r\nObservatory, Robert Simpson Woodward, '72_e_, President of the Carnegie\r\nInstitution, John M. Schaeberle, '76_e_, Astronomer in the Lick\r\nObservatory from 1888 to 1897, and George Cary Comstock, '77, Director\r\nof the Observatory of the University of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nEdward Olney, whose spirit still lives in the memory of older graduates,\r\nalso came at this time. He was, unlike most other members of the\r\nFaculty, for the most part a self-made scholar of whose ability as a\r\nteacher one former student rather ruefully remarked that the \"students\r\nknew something about mathematics when they got through with him.\" He was\r\nalways a prominent figure in the shaping of University policies and to\r\nhim no small measure of credit is given for the diploma system of\r\nadmission from the high schools in '71 and the elective system of '78.\r\n\r\nThe year 1867 brought the appointment to professorships of two men,\r\nalready mentioned, whose reputation eventually became nationwide. The\r\nfirst was Charles Kendall Adams, who afterward became President of\r\nCornell University and the University of Wisconsin. He was graduated\r\nfrom the University with the class of '61, and after some years as\r\ninstructor and Assistant Professor followed Andrew D. White in the chair\r\nof history. The other was Moses Coit Tyler, Yale, '57, Professor of\r\nRhetoric and English Literature, whose \"History of American Literature,\"\r\npublished before he left Michigan in 1881, to go to Cornell, as well as\r\nmany later works, gave him an established place as an authority in this\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nProfessor Boise resigned the chair of Greek in 1868 to accept a similar\r\nplace at the University of Chicago. It is said that his reason for the\r\nchange was, in part at least, his desire to give his daughter, Alice\r\nBoise, an opportunity to matriculate in an institution where women were\r\nenrolled. While living in Ann Arbor she had already attended\r\nunofficially at least two classes, and was probably the first woman to\r\nrecite in the University. Professor Boise was succeeded by Professor\r\nMartin L. D'Ooge, '62, whose fine enthusiasm for the best in classical\r\nculture and his genius for friendship were long with the University. For\r\nseveral years before his death in 1915, Professor D'Ooge was, with Dr.\r\nAngell, one of the few links which tied the present Faculty to the era\r\nof those earlier leaders.\r\n\r\nBut the names of all the hundreds of members of the Faculties, who came\r\nin ever-increasing numbers after this period, cannot all be mentioned,\r\nthough many have played important roles in the growth and development of\r\nthe University. No record of the Faculty, however, can be left without\r\nmention of the Rev. Benjamin F. Cocker, M.A., Wesleyan, '64, who\r\nsucceeded Dr. Haven in the chair of Mental and Moral Philosophy in 1869,\r\na strong and vital figure, of English birth but a citizen of the world,\r\nwho at one time nearly lost his life at the hands of cannibals in the\r\nSouth Seas. He and his family arrived in America penniless, but his\r\nability as a thinker and preacher soon made him a place and eventually a\r\nprofessorship in the University, where he was long remembered. He was\r\nsucceeded by Professor George S. Morris, Dartmouth, '61, who had come to\r\nthe University in 1870 as Professor of Modern Languages, a man of\r\ntotally different caliber, not so rugged and picturesque but more\r\nsensitive and profound, the first real scholar in the modern sense in\r\nthe Department of Philosophy. Upon his death in 1889 he was succeeded by\r\nthe eminent philosopher John Dewey, Vermont, '79, who was followed in\r\nturn in 1896 by Robert Mark Wenley, who came to Michigan bearing the\r\nhighest honors of the University of Glasgow. Within the Department of\r\nPhilosophy has also developed the special chair of Psychology, held by\r\nProfessor Walter B. Pillsbury, Nebraska, '92, who came to the University\r\nin 1897 as instructor in the subject. Of these men it may be said that\r\nthey have all contributed their share to the singularly high place the\r\nstudy of philosophy and metaphysics has continued to hold, even in this\r\nutilitarian age, among the students of the University.\r\n\r\nElisha Jones, '59, who became Assistant Professor of Latin in 1875 and\r\nAssociate Professor in 1881, was also a teacher to whose memory long\r\ngenerations of students pay tribute, not only for their introduction to\r\nLatin through his textbooks, but for his fine simplicity and enthusiasm\r\nfor his work. At his death in 1888 his widow established a fellowship\r\nwhich for many years aided many embryo classical scholars. Professor\r\nFrieze, the head of the department, outlived him and was succeeded by\r\nFrancis W. Kelsey, Rochester, '80, whose labors in behalf of the\r\nclassics, and as president of the American School of Classical Studies\r\nat Rome, and the Archeological Institute of America, have been widely\r\nrecognized. Associated for long years with Professor D'Ooge in the\r\nDepartment of Greek was Albert H. Pattengill, '68, who died in 1906. He\r\nwas another extraordinary teacher, whose strong personality will long be\r\nremembered, while his love of outdoor sports will be honored by\r\ngenerations of athletes whose interests he served unselfishly throughout\r\nhis lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe resignation of Charles Kendall Adams brought another loved\r\npersonality to the University, Richard Hudson, '71, whose gentle\r\npeculiarities only endeared him to his students. He succeeded Professor\r\nD'Ooge as Dean of the Literary College in 1898. He was a most\r\nconscientious teacher who believed in the meticulous presentation of\r\nfacts in his lectures, though one student at least found that after a\r\nlong series of lectures about the \"low countries,\" \"Flanders,\" and the\r\n\"Spanish cities,\" something else was needed, when confronted by an\r\nexamination on the _history of Belgium_. His method of teaching was his\r\nown but effective, though many alumni will appreciate his remark to a\r\nyoung instructor, as he poised his right forefinger in midair and\r\ncleared his throat, \"I wonder if you have any mannerisms that would make\r\nyou conspicuous before a class?\" Professor Hudson not only gave his\r\nlibrary to the University but also left a legacy of $75,000 for the\r\nestablishment of a Professorship in History. Another popular figure of a\r\ngeneration not too long ago was Andrew C. McLaughlin, '82, the\r\nson-in-law of Dr. Angell, now Professor of History at the University of\r\nChicago. Upon the retirement of Professor Hudson in 1911, Claude H. Van\r\nTyne, '96, Professor of American History since 1906, became head of the\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nIn the Department of English and Rhetoric Professor Tyler was succeeded\r\nin 1881 by Isaac N. Demmon, '68, who had been Assistant Professor of\r\nRhetoric and History since 1876. Professor Demmon's service in the\r\nUniversity, which did not end until his retirement as Emeritus\r\nProfessor, and his death, in 1920, was long and self-sacrificing. He\r\nleft a monument to his interest in the Library in several special\r\ncollections, particularly in the Dramatic and Shakespearian libraries,\r\nwhile his knowledge of the University's history and his remarkable\r\nacquaintance among the alumni have been invaluable in the editing of\r\nvarious editions of the Alumni Catalogue, and the revision and extension\r\nof Professor Hinsdale's \"History.\" In 1903 Fred N. Scott, '84, became\r\nhead of the newly created Department of Rhetoric. As occupant of this\r\nchair Professor Scott, in addition to his scholarly work, evinced by\r\nmany books and articles, has been an inspiration, guide, and father\r\nconfessor to hundreds of students and alumni whose interest lay in\r\nliterature and authorship.\r\n\r\nIn modern languages, the task dropped by Professor Fasquelle at his\r\ndeath in 1862 was continued by Edward Payson Evans, '54, until 1870 and\r\nthen by George S. Morris until his acceptance of the Professorship of\r\nPhilosophy in 1879. Edwin Lorraine Walter, '68, was then elected to the\r\nchair. In 1887 the Department was divided and Calvin Thomas, '74, became\r\nProfessor of Germanic Languages and Literature, to be succeeded, after\r\nhis call to Columbia University in 1896, by George A. Hench, Lafayette,\r\n'85, who lost his life three years later in an accident in the White\r\nMountains. Max Winkler, Harvard, '89, the present occupant of the chair,\r\neventually succeeded him. After Professor Walter lost his life on the\r\nBourgogne in 1898, the chair of French was filled by Arthur G. Canfield,\r\nWilliams, '78.\r\n\r\nWhen the new chair in the Science and Art of Teaching was first\r\nestablished in 1879, William H. Payne was appointed as the first\r\nProfessor. He was an experienced teacher in the secondary schools of the\r\nState and contributed much to the eventual success of the new\r\ndepartment. After he resigned in 1887 to become Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity of Nashville, Burke Aaron Hinsdale, a graduate and for some\r\ntime President of Hiram College, Ohio, and an intimate associate of\r\nPresident Garfield, was elected to succeed him. Under Professor\r\nHinsdale's strong and vigorous guidance, the department rapidly advanced\r\nto a recognized place in the curriculum. Though his bearing was somewhat\r\naustere and overwhelming, he could unbend, as was proved on one occasion\r\nin the Library when his booming voice brought an admonition from an\r\nofficial. Just then an influential member of the Library Committee\r\nchanced to appear. He proved a greater disturber of the peace than\r\nProfessor Hinsdale, who, nudging his companion, slyly inquired, with the\r\nsuspicion of a grin, \"Why don't you tell _him_ to keep quiet?\" Professor\r\nHinsdale was distinguished by his prolific and scholarly writings and\r\nleft a monument in his \"History of the University,\" which will long be\r\nrecognized as the standard for the period up to 1900. His death\r\noccurred in that year, and the chair thus left vacant was occupied by\r\nAllen S. Whitney, '85, whose title was changed in 1905 to Professor of\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\nAfter the resignation of Professor Watson in 1879, the chair of\r\nAstronomy was occupied by Mark Walrod Harrington, '68, until 1892; later\r\nhe became President of the University of Washington. He was succeeded by\r\nWilliam J. Hussey, '89. Since the death of Professor Olney in 1887, the\r\nDepartment of Mathematics has been under the charge of Wooster W. Beman,\r\n'70, a member of the Faculty since 1871, whose name now stands first as\r\nto length of service on the academic roster.\r\n\r\nAlbert Benjamin Prescott, '64_m_, who eventually succeeded Dr. Silas H.\r\nDouglas as Director of the Chemical Laboratory, became Assistant\r\nProfessor of Chemistry in 1865. He organized the course in Pharmacy\r\nthree years later, becoming Professor of Organic and Applied Chemistry\r\nand of Pharmacy in 1870. In 1876 he became Dean of the new College of\r\nPharmacy and in 1884 Director of the Chemical Laboratory. Upon his death\r\nin 1905 he was succeeded as Director of the Chemical Laboratory by\r\nEdward DeMille Campbell, '86, who had been Professor of Chemical\r\nEngineering and Analytical Chemistry since 1902. After the retirement of\r\nProfessor Williams in 1877, Charles K. Wead, Vermont, '71, became Acting\r\nProfessor of Physics, to be succeeded in 1885 by Henry Smith Carhart,\r\nWesleyan, '69, who held the chair of Physics and the Directorship of the\r\nPhysical Laboratory until his retirement in 1905. His successor was John\r\nOren Reed, '85, who became also Dean of the Literary Department in 1907.\r\nUpon Dean Reed's death in 1916 the Professorship of Physics passed to\r\nHarrison McAllister Randall, '93, who became Director of the Physical\r\nLaboratory in 1918.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNIVERSITY OBSERVATORY\r\nThe original building at the right]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HILL AUDITORIUM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHEMISTRY BUILDING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NATURAL SCIENCE BUILDING]\r\n\r\nAt the end of Professor Winchell's first period in the University in\r\n'73, the several subjects which comprised his professorship were\r\ndivided. The chair of Botany passed to Eugene Woldemar Hilgard, Ph.D.,\r\nHeidelberg, '53, who was succeeded two years later by Volney Morgan\r\nSpalding, '73, as Instructor in Botany and Zooelogy, becoming Professor\r\nof Botany in 1886. Upon his resignation in 1904 the chair was occupied\r\nby Frederick Charles Newcombe, '90. The work in Zooelogy passed to Joseph\r\nBeal Steere, '68, who became an Assistant Professor in 1876, after five\r\nyears of travel in the interests of the University in South America,\r\nChina, and the East Indies, where he collected some 20,000 specimens for\r\nthe Museum. He became Professor of Zooelogy in 1879, and retained the\r\nchair until 1894, when he was succeeded by Jacob E. Reighard, '82.\r\nWilliam Henry Pettee, Harvard, '61, assumed the work in mineralogy in\r\n1875 under the title of Professor of Mining Engineering. In addition to\r\nhis work in his own subject, he served from 1881 to 1904 as editor of\r\nthe University Calendar and advisory editor of other University\r\npublications. Edward Henry Kraus, Syracuse, '96, who occupies the chair\r\nof Mineralogy at present, first came to the University in 1904 and\r\nsucceeded to the chair in 1908. When Professor Winchell returned to the\r\nUniversity after his term as Chancellor of the University of Syracuse,\r\nhe became Professor of Geology and held that position until his death in\r\n1891, when he was succeeded by Israel Cook Russell, New York University,\r\n'69. Upon Professor Russell's death in 1906, William Herbert Hobbs,\r\nWorcester Polytechnic, '83, was called to the chair from the University\r\nof Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThough courses in economics were given in the University almost from the\r\nfirst and; in fact, with International Law, formed the special field of\r\nwork assumed by Dr. Angell for some years, the Department of Political\r\nEconomy as such was not organized until after Henry C. Adams, Iowa\r\nCollege, '74, who came to the University as a lecturer in 1881, accepted\r\nthe chair of Political Economy in 1887. The first step toward a chair in\r\nSociology came with the appointment in 1899 of Charles Horton Cooley,\r\n'87, a son of Judge Thomas M. Cooley, of the first Law Faculty, as\r\nAssistant Professor of Sociology, from which position he rose to a full\r\nprofessorship in eight years. A separate chair of Political Science was\r\nnot created until 1910, when Jesse Siddall Reeves, Amherst, '91, came as\r\nthe head of the new department. The Department of Music had its first\r\nbeginning with the appointment of Calvin Brainerd Cady, Oberlin, '74, as\r\ninstructor in 1880. He became Acting Professor of Music in 1885, but\r\nresigned three years later when Albert A. Stanley, Leipzig, '75, came as\r\nthe head of the Department and a few years later Director of the\r\nUniversity School of Music, now closely associated with the work of the\r\nUniversity though not in any way a part of it. After the disappearance\r\nfrom the Faculty roll of the name of the Detroit portrait painter, Alvah\r\nBradish, who apparently gave a few lectures on Fine Arts during the\r\nperiod from 1852 to 1863, no work in fine arts was given until the\r\nappointment of Professor Herbert R. Cross, Brown, '00, in 1911. The work\r\nin elocution and oratory was definitely established with the appointment\r\nin 1889 of Thomas C. Trueblood, M.A., Earlham, '85, who had for some\r\nyears held a lectureship in the University, as Assistant Professor of\r\nElocution and in 1892 as full Professor of Oratory.\r\n\r\nThe chair of Semitics and Oriental Languages, held since 1914 by Leroy\r\nWaterman, Hillsdale, '98, was first established in 1893 when James A.\r\nCraig, McGill, '80, came as Professor of Oriental Languages, a title\r\nwhich was changed to Semitic Languages and Literatures and Hellenistic\r\nGreek the following year.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of Yale and Cornell, Michigan established a\r\nDepartment of Forestry in 1903, and called Filibert Roth, '90, to fill\r\nthe chair thus created. For some time courses in forestry had been given\r\nin connection with the work in botany, but the growing interest in the\r\npreservation and conservation of America's timber resources made more\r\nintensive and systematic training seem desirable. A few years later, in\r\n1909, a course in landscape design was established, which shortly became\r\na department under the charge of Professor Aubrey Tealdi, a graduate of\r\nthe Royal Technical Institute of Livorno, Italy.\r\n\r\nThe history of the development of special courses and degrees in the\r\nUniversity, though interesting and suggestive, can only be given here in\r\na brief outline. As Dr. Angell remarked in one of his reports, the\r\ngoverning board has been distinguished for the boldness and originality\r\nof its policy, making frequent changes in traditional college usages,\r\nsome of which were freely criticized at the time by those who afterwards\r\napproved and even adopted them. We have seen how the University departed\r\nfrom the dead level of contemporary college practice in establishing\r\nScientific Courses, and the admitting of those who were not seeking a\r\ndegree as special students. A few years later, in 1855, came the first\r\nindication of one of the principal differences between the old\r\nUniversity and that of the present time--the system of elective studies.\r\nThe concession was a very small one, it must be acknowledged, one-third\r\nof the work in the senior year; but it was a break in the dike. This was\r\nall that was allowed for fifteen years, or until 1871, when all the\r\nstudies of the senior year except philosophy became elective.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of an English course in 1877-78, leading to the degree\r\nof Bachelor of Letters, which consisted largely in the study of modern\r\nlanguages and history, and aimed to co-ordinate with similar high school\r\ncourses, formed another break, which was emphasized by a modification\r\nand revision of the other courses and a change from the Latin and\r\nScientific to the Latin course. Almost half the work required for a\r\ndegree now became elective. This action was far-reaching in its effect;\r\nnot only was there an immediate increase of almost twenty percent in the\r\nnumber of students, but due to it, curiously enough, can be traced the\r\nsubsequent rise of a true graduate school. The principle of general\r\nelection of studies was gradually extended until the required work was\r\ndecreased to certain introductory courses in Latin, Greek, modern\r\nlanguages, rhetoric, history, mathematics, and sciences, according to\r\nthe special fields chosen by the student. The special degrees of B.S.,\r\nPh.B., and B.L. were abolished in 1900 and all graduates of the Literary\r\nDepartment were granted a degree of A.B. after that time, though the\r\nB.S. was later restored. Of late there has been a reaction toward more\r\nformal programs of study, with an increased emphasis on certain\r\nintroductory work which must be observed in planning the course\r\nnecessary for a degree. But the great latitude left to the student in\r\nthe choice of his work still remains.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the Graduate School should also be noted, for upon this\r\nthe standing of the University as a center of learning must eventually\r\nrest. In spite of Dr. Tappan's efforts to introduce \"university\"\r\ncourses, Michigan was long a college rather than a university, so much\r\nso that President Haven discouraged the use of the word \"undergraduate\"\r\nwhen \"graduate\" students were almost non-existent; while the\r\nopportunities offered them, except possibly in astronomy and chemistry,\r\nwhere the facilities were unusual for that period, were only those of a\r\nhigh grade college curriculum. But the leaven was working, in two\r\nparticulars especially; the seminar method of teaching and the\r\ndevelopment of the elective system. The first seminar was held by\r\nProfessor Charles Kendall Adams in 1871 in some of his courses in\r\nhistory. He was followed a little later by Professor Moses Coit Tyler in\r\nEnglish Literature, and in time by most of the other departments. This,\r\nwith the corresponding laboratory methods in the teaching of the\r\nsciences, had a profound influence on the growth of scholarly ideals in\r\nthe University. Michigan was in all probability the first American\r\ninstitution to naturalize these products of Continental universities.\r\nThe broadening of the course in 1877-78, with its great increase in\r\nelectives, enabled the members of the Faculty to increase the scope of\r\ntheir work and to expand their courses. As an immediate answer there\r\ncame an ever increasing demand for true graduate work, not only from\r\ngraduates of the University, but from those of other institutions as\r\nwell. This movement grew so rapidly that the number of advanced students\r\nenrolled increased from four in 1870 to 56 in 1892, when a Graduate\r\nSchool was formally organized in connection with the Literary\r\nDepartment. This was expanded some twenty-five years later into an\r\nentirely separate Department, or School, following the revised\r\nnomenclature of 1910, of which Professor Karl Eugen Guthe, Marburg,\r\nPh.D., '89, of the Department of Physics, became the first Dean. Upon\r\nhis death in the summer of 1915 he was succeeded by Professor Alfred H.\r\nLloyd, Harvard, '86, of the Department of Philosophy.\r\n\r\nThus graduate work in the University came into its own. At last the\r\nideals of President Tappan, who admitted the first graduate student in\r\n1856, were in some measure at least realized; though the real results of\r\nhis labors did not show for many years after he left.\r\n\r\nThroughout all the early period the general attitude towards advanced\r\nwork was decidedly haphazard and casual; the degree of Doctor of\r\nPhilosophy was not given until 1876, when Dr. Victor C. Vaughan, the\r\npresent Dean of the Medical School, was one of the first recipients;\r\nwhile the Ph.D. as well as the M.D. were sometimes given as honorary\r\ndegrees. This attitude toward graduate study, however, was by no means\r\nconfined to Michigan, for the systematic regulation of advanced courses\r\nhas been comparatively a recent development in all American\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\nThe first organization of the School under a Graduate Council within the\r\nLiterary Department, was therefore a great step in advance, however\r\nanomalous its position,--a graduate school practically controlled by an\r\nundergraduate faculty,--though there were, it is true, certain\r\nrepresentatives of the professional departments on the Council.\r\nNevertheless the work grew rapidly after this time. Not only was there a\r\nsteadily increasing enrolment, but there was a distinct increase in the\r\nnumber of advanced courses, as well as in the time given by teachers to\r\ngraduate instruction and to research work, which greatly strengthened\r\nthe prestige of the University as a center of higher education.\r\n\r\nThe final establishment of the School as a separate division of the\r\nUniversity naturally gave a decided impetus to this development. A\r\nsuite of offices was set apart for the administrative force; special\r\nencouragement was given to the publication of the results of their work\r\nby members of the Faculty, particularly through such agencies as the\r\nUniversity Humanistic Series, and similar series in other fields, while\r\nfifteen University fellowships were also established, as well as the\r\nState College Fellowships mentioned above. In addition a number of\r\nfellowships have been privately established by individuals and\r\ncorporations, ranging from the classics to paper-making. During the last\r\nfew years there have been in all between thirty-five and forty-five\r\nfellowships ordinarily available. The enrolment in the School reached\r\n570 in 1916. There was naturally a falling off during the war, though by\r\nthe year 1919-20 the enrolment had once more reached 509. Of this number\r\n227 were registered in the summer session, 173 were women and 195 were\r\ngraduates of other institutions than Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe history of the University Library has been closely associated, as is\r\nonly natural, with the growth of the Literary College, and it is proper\r\nto include a word about the Library in this place. The appointment of\r\nthe first Librarian in 1837 did not make a library, and for many years\r\nthe fine but small collection of books gathered in Europe by Professor\r\nGray was housed in different places about the Campus and was used only\r\nas a circulating library--open for one hour each week for the use of the\r\nprofessors and students. However a note in the library regulations to\r\nthe effect that: \"The present instructors are of opinion that there are\r\nvery few of the books in the library which would be useful to students,\"\r\nseems to limit even this function of the little collection. All this was\r\nchanged in 1856 when the whole North Wing was set apart as a Museum and\r\nLibrary. Here for the first time, the books were properly shelved and\r\narrangements made for their daily use in an adequate reading-room under\r\nthe charge of Dr. Tappan's son, John L. Tappan, who took charge as the\r\nfirst real Librarian. He arranged the books scientifically and began the\r\nfirst card catalogue.\r\n\r\nAlmost at once the Library sprang into a new place in University life.\r\nNot only did President Tappan make the Library one of his first\r\ninterests, but the Regents came to realize the desirability of regular\r\nsupport. This inaugurated a period of ever-increasing growth, which has\r\nplaced the Library well to the front among American college libraries.\r\nProgress at first was rather slow, only about 800 volumes were added\r\neach year up to 1877, when the Librarian reported that there were almost\r\n24,000 volumes in the collection. Not very large even then; but the rate\r\nincreased from that time, rapidly, and at the present time the Library\r\nnumbers some 430,000 volumes including the departmental collections.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 the Legislature was brought to see the imperative need of an\r\nadequate library and made a special appropriation of $5,000, which was\r\nrenewed every two years, and even gradually increased, until in 1891 the\r\namount appropriated was $15,000, with a grand total over a period of\r\nfifteen years of $79,000. These biennial appropriations ended in 1893\r\nwith the increase of the mill-tax from one-twentieth to one-sixth of a\r\nmill. This enabled the Regents to double the income of the Library,\r\nmaking it $15,000 annually. The income increased gradually until the\r\nlibrary budget of 1920 was over $150,000, of which $50,000 represents\r\nthe approximate cost of books; the balance being spent for the salaries\r\nof the large staff which is necessitated by a library of this size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW LIBRARY]\r\n\r\nUpon the completion of the first Law Building in 1863 the Library was\r\ngiven new and better quarters where it remained until the old Library\r\nwas completed in 1883. This was at the time considered the last word in\r\na college library and was dedicated with special exercises at which an\r\naddress was given by Dr. Justin Winsor, Librarian of Harvard University.\r\nFor thirty-five years this building, situated at the center of the\r\nCampus, with its picturesque twin towers rising above the ivy-covered\r\napse, served the University well. Here was not only the center of\r\nacademic life, but from one of the towers the Campus clock chimed the\r\nhours and quarters for the convenience of the students. In the end,\r\nhowever, the old building proved inadequate and unsafe for the valuable\r\ncollections it housed, in spite of an increase in stack capacity in\r\n1899. The building was therefore finally removed to make way for the new\r\nLibrary, completed in 1919, which, through its perfect adaptation to the\r\npurposes for which it is designed, is considered the most conveniently\r\nappointed and successful college library in the country. The building\r\nwill accommodate over one million volumes and there are definite plans\r\nfor future extension which will house over three-quarters of a million\r\nin addition. The stack wing of the old Library was incorporated in the\r\nbuilding, permitting the gradual erection of the new structure in such a\r\nmanner that the use of the books was not interfered with at any time.\r\nThe new Library was formally opened on January 7, 1920, with an address\r\nby Mr. R.R. Bowker, the editor of _The Library Journal_, as the\r\nprincipal feature of the programme. The building cost, completed and\r\nfurnished, $615,000, of which amount the sum of $550,000 was especially\r\nappropriated by the State Legislature.\r\n\r\nAfter the resignation of the first Librarian, the Rev. Henry Colclazer,\r\nin 1845, the charge of the Library was passed around from one member of\r\nthe Faculty to another until the appointment of John L. Tappan in 1856,\r\nnominally the eighth, though in reality the first Librarian. He was\r\nfollowed by Datus Chase Brooks, who held the position one year, when the\r\nRev. Andrew Ten Brook, who had once before held the title during the\r\nyear 1850-51, returned to the University as Librarian in 1864. Not only\r\nwere the affairs of the Library well cared for during his\r\nadministration, but he also found time to write his \"History of State\r\nUniversities,\" which gives the only adequate picture we have of the\r\nbeginnings of the University, by one who shared their trials and\r\ntriumphs. Upon his resignation in 1877 Raymond Cazallis Davis, '55-'57,\r\nA.M. (hon.) '81, succeeded him, contributing greatly during the\r\ntwenty-eight years of his administration towards the establishment of\r\nthe Library on its present effective basis. In this effort he was\r\nsupported by the advice and co-operation of Professor Isaac N. Demmon,\r\nwho was for thirty-seven years a member of the Library Committee.\r\nTheodore Wesley Koch, Harvard, '93, became Librarian in 1905, coming\r\nfrom the Library of Congress in Washington. It was his main effort to\r\npopularize the use of the Library among the students and Faculties,\r\nthrough making the reading-rooms more attractive and the books more\r\naccessible. The Library of Congress was again called upon for his\r\nsuccessor after he resigned in 1915, when the present Librarian, William\r\nWarner Bishop, '92, came in time to give his experience and\r\nadministrative ability to the planning and construction of the new\r\nLibrary Building. To him in no small measure is due its acknowledged\r\nsuccess as a working library which has won the praise of all practical\r\nlibrarians throughout the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first steps toward the establishment of a Faculty of Medicine and\r\nSurgery were taken in 1847. The Medical Building was not completed,\r\nhowever, until two years later, and the formal opening of the new\r\nDepartment did not take place until October 1, 1850. On this occasion\r\nAbram Sager, the first President, or Dean of the Faculty, as we should\r\nnow call him, delivered an address to ninety matriculates, at a time\r\nwhen there were only sixty-four students all told in the Literary\r\nDepartment. The period was propitious for the installation of a strong\r\nschool, for although there were a few struggling medical institutions in\r\nthe West, the vigorous growth of the new Department showed how\r\ninadequately this part of the country was served in medical education.\r\nThe entrance requirements were simple; a fair high school education,\r\nwith Latin and Greek sufficient for the understanding of medical terms.\r\nFor graduation, at least three years' study with a reputable physician\r\nwas required; but this might include the two six-month courses of\r\nlectures which comprised the work of the Department. Even this very\r\nslender medical preparation was not required of college graduates, or of\r\nstudents who had already practised medicine four years, for whom one\r\ncourse was deemed sufficient. A thesis was also necessary for\r\ngraduation, and tradition has it that in a few cases during the earlier\r\ndays of the Department, they were actually written and delivered in\r\nLatin. Special attention was given to laboratory work in chemistry and\r\nanatomy, though for the most part the training was given through\r\nlectures and quizzes. The conservatism of the Literary Department in\r\neducational methods here also found its parallel, even in the\r\ncomparatively new sciences.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of clinical methods came slowly, though the growing\r\ncity of Ann Arbor furnished many opportunities for actual diagnosis and\r\ntreatment. The lack of practical facilities for study was early\r\nrecognized, however, and within a few years some of the members of the\r\nMedical Faculty established a school for clinical instruction in\r\nDetroit, which eventually led to the first effort for the removal of the\r\nschool mentioned in the last chapter. In spite of this difficulty the\r\nDepartment grew so rapidly that within ten years it had an enrolment of\r\n242 matriculates and 43 graduates; more students than were enrolled at\r\nYale, Harvard, or Virginia, the leading medical schools of that day. The\r\ngrowth came so rapidly, in fact, that it proved embarrassing and the\r\nRegents experienced great difficulty in finding accommodations for the\r\nstudents. In 1864 an addition was made to the original Medical Building\r\nwhich more than doubled its capacity and in 1868 one of the professors'\r\nhouses on the north side of the Campus was fitted up as the first\r\nUniversity Hospital. By 1874 Latin and Greek had been dropped from the\r\nrequirements for admission; a possible backward step which was more than\r\ncounterbalanced three years later by the extension of the annual course\r\nof lectures to nine months. Finally in 1880 an extra year was added to\r\nthe course.\r\n\r\nThe long roster of the Medical Faculty has included many distinguished\r\nnames, of which but a few can be mentioned, and none with the detail\r\ntheir services to their profession and to science deserve. The first\r\nFaculty consisted of the two recruits from the Literary Department, Dr.\r\nSager, who became Professor of Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and\r\nChildren, and Dr. Douglas, who assumed the chair of Chemistry, Pharmacy,\r\nand Medical Jurisprudence in the new school; as well as four other\r\nmembers, Moses Gunn, who was a graduate of Geneva Medical College, 1846,\r\nProfessor of Anatomy and Surgery; Samuel Denton, Castleton Medical\r\nCollege (Vermont), '25, a former Regent, who became Professor of the\r\nTheory and Practice of Medicine and Pathology; J. Adams Allen,\r\nMiddlebury, '45, Professor of Therapeutics, Materia Medica, and\r\nPhysiology; and R.C. Kedzie, '51_m_, demonstrator of anatomy, who later\r\nwas for nearly forty years Professor of Chemistry at the Michigan\r\nAgricultural College.\r\n\r\nDr. Sager, the first Dean of the Department, was one of its most learned\r\nand versatile members; so thoroughly possessed of the scientific spirit\r\nthat his abilities were not always appreciated by his students, or, it\r\nmust be confessed, by his colleagues. Of his ability as a practitioner\r\n\"a few of the older residents of Ann Arbor speak reverently and\r\nlovingly.\" Dr. Gunn, who had charge of the Anatomical Laboratory, the\r\nfirst laboratory to be established in the University, deserves, in the\r\nopinion of Dr. Vaughan, the present Dean of the School, to be called the\r\nfounder of the Department. This honor, however, might properly be\r\ndivided with Dr. Zina Pitcher of Detroit, who, as a member of the first\r\nBoard of Regents, was responsible for the early introduction of the\r\nteaching of medicine in the University. But Dr. Gunn was on the ground\r\nas early as 1849, and from the first he labored earnestly and\r\neffectively in the organization of the new Department, which was beset\r\nby many difficulties, particularly in his own field, where the problem\r\nof finding adequate material for the study of anatomy was almost\r\ninsuperable for many years. Many are the hints given in the\r\nreminiscences of the older men of the practical ways this difficulty was\r\nmet, but for the most part the matter is shrouded in a discreet silence.\r\nDr. Gunn was of a commanding character and presence and his \"trained\r\nhand dared to do many operations, the landmarks of which were not then\r\ndescribed in the works on surgery.\" He soon gave up his work in Anatomy\r\nand was succeeded in 1854 by Dr. Corydon La Ford, Geneva, '42, a\r\nsensitive and earnest teacher, who had a way of \"making dry bones and\r\nanatomical tissues of absorbing interest.\" It is said of him that in his\r\nday he probably taught more students than any other teacher of anatomy.\r\nOccupying hardly a lesser place than Dr. Ford in the memories of the\r\nolder medical graduates was his factotum, Gregor Nagele, better known as\r\n\"Doc\" Nagele. As an immigrant just landed, he helped in the construction\r\nof the old Medical Building and remained to become for years the\r\npresiding genius of the Department, and, through his long association\r\nwith Dr. Ford, an unofficial demonstrator of anatomy to the \"boys.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Denton, another member of that first Faculty, was long remembered by\r\nhis students because of his high hat and his buck-board wagon, as well\r\nas by his belief in the medical efficiency of alcohol; in which he came\r\ninto violent conflict with one of his confreres and eventual successor\r\nin the Professorship of Pathology and Theory and Practice. This was Dr.\r\nA.B. Palmer, a graduate of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in\r\n1839, who in 1854 succeeded Dr. Allen, the first of the original Faculty\r\nto go. Dr. Palmer was a conspicuous personage in Ann Arbor for many\r\nyears, energetic in public welfare and a lover not only of his\r\nprofession but of his professorship and its duties. One of his\r\nstudents remarks: \"He would have been willing to get up in the night and\r\nlecture if asked, so enthusiastic was he in his efforts to help the\r\nstudent.\" He was the first member of the Medical Faculty to apply for\r\nleave of absence that he might study abroad. That was in 1858.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ENGINEERING BUILDING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MEDICAL BUILDING]\r\n\r\nOther appointments of particular importance in the earlier years of the\r\nMedical Department were those of Samuel G. Armor, Missouri Medical\r\nCollege, '44, who became Professor of the Institutes of Medicine and\r\nMateria Medica in 1861, and of Albert Benjamin Prescott, '64_m_, who\r\nentered the same year upon his long term of distinguished service in the\r\nChemical Laboratory and later the Department of Pharmacy, loved and\r\nhonored by many generations of students. Changes in the personnel of the\r\nFaculty were frequent, however, and few men remained long enough to\r\nidentify their lives wholly with that of the University. When Dr. Sager\r\nretired as Emeritus Professor and Dean in 1874, Dr. Edward S. Dunster,\r\nNew York College of Medicine and Surgery, '59, was appointed to his\r\nchair, and held it until his death in 1888. Dr. Palmer succeeded Dr.\r\nSager as Dean, but in 1887, the position passed to Dr. Ford, and then,\r\nin 1891, to Dr. Victor C. Vaughan, Mt. Pleasant (Mo.) College, '72; M.D.\r\n(Michigan), '78, the first graduate of the School to become its Dean. He\r\nhas been a member of the Faculty since 1879, serving as Professor of\r\nPhysiology and Pathological Chemistry and Assistant Professor of\r\nTherapeutics and Materia Medica.\r\n\r\nAs the growth of the School continued and as the field of medical\r\nknowledge widened, new laboratories and professorships were continually\r\nbecoming necessary. The early history of the Anatomical Laboratory has\r\nbeen touched upon. Dr. Ford remained in charge until 1894, when he was\r\nsucceeded by Dr. J. Playfair McMurrich, Toronto, '79, who did much for\r\nthe advancement of the scientific study of anatomy until his return to\r\nToronto in 1907, when George Linius Streeter, Union, '95, assumed the\r\nchair. He resigned in 1914, and Dr. G. Carl Huber, '87_m_, Professor of\r\nHistology then became Director of the Anatomical Laboratories. Mention\r\nshould also be made in this place of the services of Dr. George E.\r\nFothingham, '64_m_, Professor of Ophthalmology from 1870 to 1889, who\r\nfor some years was connected with the Department of Anatomy and drafted\r\nthe first good anatomical law.\r\n\r\nCourses in histology were given as far back as 1856 but the emphasis on\r\nscientific methods did not come for many years, and the courses in both\r\nhistology and physiology were long taught solely by lectures. In 1877,\r\nhowever, the Legislature appropriated $3,500 for a laboratory in those\r\nsubjects and Dr. C.H. Stowell, '72_m_, was appointed instructor,\r\nbecoming Assistant Professor in 1880. About the same time a separate\r\nchair in physiology was created with Dr. Henry Sewall, Wesleyan, '76, as\r\nthe first Professor. Under Dr. Sewall the Physiological Laboratory grew\r\nrapidly; new apparatus was purchased and many valuable researches were\r\nconducted, not the least of these being the proof, published in 1887,\r\nthat pigeons might be immunized against rattle-snake poison,--one of the\r\nfirst cases of the production of an artificial immunity. The two\r\ndepartments were again united in 1889 under Dr. William H. Howell, Johns\r\nHopkins, '81. He was succeeded in 1892 by Dr. Warren P. Lombard,\r\nHarvard, '78, who held both Professorships until 1898, when Dr. Huber,\r\nat that time Assistant Professor of Anatomy, was made Director of the\r\nHistological Laboratory, becoming Junior Professor in 1899 and\r\nProfessor of Histology and Embryology four years later.\r\n\r\nA Laboratory in Electro-Therapeutics was opened in 1878, the first of\r\nits kind in America, largely through the efforts of Dr. John W. Langley,\r\nHarvard, '61, M.D. Michigan, (hon.) '77, Professor of General Chemistry\r\nat that time; but the subject did not become a compulsory part of the\r\ncourse until the appointment in 1890 of Dr. William J. Herdman, '72, who\r\nhad been a member of the Medical Faculty since 1875, as Professor of\r\nNervous Diseases and Electro-Therapeutics. Practical instruction in\r\npathology was inaugurated in 1879 under Dr. Herdman and Dr. Victor C.\r\nVaughan, but the beginnings were modest and laboratory work only became\r\nincorporated in the course in 1888 under Dr. Heneage Gibbes, Aberdeen,\r\n'79, called from London as Professor of Pathology. Even then the\r\nquarters were extremely limited and the laboratory was moved several\r\ntimes before its final establishment in the present Medical Building in\r\n1903. In 1895 Dr. George Dock, Pennsylvania, '84, Professor of the\r\nTheory and Practice of Medicine and Clinical Medicine since 1891,\r\nsucceeded Dr. Gibbes in the chair of Pathology but resigned it in 1903\r\nto Dr. Aldred Scott Warthin, '91_m_, (Indiana, '88), who became also\r\nDirector of the Pathological Laboratory.\r\n\r\nA request from the State Board of Health led to the opening of a\r\nHygienic Laboratory in 1888, with the threefold object of instruction,\r\nresearch, and the examination of suspected food and water, with Dr. V.C.\r\nVaughan, who had come to the University in 1875 as an assistant in the\r\nChemical Laboratory, as its first Director.\r\n\r\nThe first officially recognized Laboratory of Clinical Medicine was\r\nestablished by Dr. Dock, when he came to the University in 1891, with\r\nthe purpose of carrying out the instrumental investigation of disease,\r\nand teaching the technique of diagnosis. This was followed the next year\r\nby demonstration courses in the different branches of medicine and\r\nsurgery. Dr. Dock was succeeded, upon his resignation in 1908, by Dr. A.\r\nWalter Hewlett, California, '95, who returned to Leland Stanford, Jr.\r\nUniversity after six years' service.\r\n\r\nA Surgical Laboratory, established soon after Dr. Charles de Nancrede,\r\nPennsylvania (M.D.), '69, came as Professor of Surgery, speedily proved\r\nits educational value, and increasing facilities were offered students\r\nfor the demonstration of surgery on bodies and on animals, with the same\r\ncare taken as to antiseptics, asepsis, and dressings as in actual\r\noperations. Dr. de Nancrede retired in 1917, and in 1919 Dr. Hugh Cabot,\r\nHarvard, '94, succeeded to the chair. A Laboratory in Experimental\r\nPharmacology, still another instance of a brand new venture on the\r\nUniversity's part, was established in 1891 under Dr. John Jacob Abel,\r\n'83. He only remained two years, however, and was succeeded by Dr.\r\nArthur R. Cushny, Aberdeen, '86, of London, under whom the new\r\nlaboratory assumed its present important place. Dr. Cushny returned to\r\nthe University College in London in 1905 and the Professorship of\r\nPharmacology eventually passed to Dr. Charles W. Edmunds, '01_m_, at\r\npresent Secretary of the Medical School. As the result of long effort on\r\nthe part of Dr. Herdman, who held the chair of Nervous Diseases, a State\r\nPsychopathic Hospital, the first of its kind in the country, was\r\nestablished at the University in 1903 under the joint supervision of the\r\nRegents and a State Board, affording a practical laboratory and clinic\r\nfor students specializing in nervous diseases. It has been under the\r\ndirection of Dr. Albert M. Barrett, Iowa, '93, Professor of Psychiatry\r\nsince 1906.\r\n\r\nThe old make-shift hospital on the Campus was enlarged in 1876, but it\r\nwas never able to overtake the ever-increasing demand, and a new\r\nbuilding eventually became imperative. This came in 1891, when the\r\npresent Hospital, soon fated to go the way of the first, was erected\r\nnortheast of the Campus on the hills above the Huron River. Designed to\r\naccommodate about eighty patients, it has been enlarged again and again,\r\nuntil finally in 1919 the State appropriated over a million dollars for\r\nan entirely new building, which will cost eventually three times that\r\nsum, to be completed in 1922. Not only will this new Hospital\r\naccommodate nearly six hundred patients under the far more exacting\r\nrequirements of modern hospital practice, but it will also be by far the\r\nlargest hospital controlled entirely by a medical school and maintained\r\nfor the sole benefit of the people of a state.\r\n\r\nThe medical course was finally increased in 1890 to four years of nine\r\nmonths, while the entrance requirements were placed on the same basis as\r\nthe admission to the classical or scientific courses in the Literary\r\nDepartment. At the same time a \"combination\" course enabled the student\r\nto graduate from both the Literary Department and the Medical School in\r\nsix years. The final evolution of the curriculum up to the present time\r\ncame in 1914 when this combination was made compulsory. This meant that\r\nat least two years' preliminary work in the Literary College was\r\nrequired before the student was permitted to enter the Medical School.\r\nIn 1903 a new Medical Building was completed at a cost of about\r\n$200,000, to provide the class rooms and laboratories for the work of\r\nthe first two years. It contains two amphitheaters, two lecture rooms,\r\nand the laboratories of hygiene, bacteriology, physiological chemistry,\r\nanatomy, histology and embryology and pathology, as well as the\r\npathological museum. To the great regret of many medical alumni, and in\r\nfact all who loved the relics of the University's first days, the\r\npicturesque old Medical Building with its simple Greek portico was razed\r\nin 1914. It had been considered unsafe for some time, and stood\r\nabandoned and unused at one side of the new building.\r\n\r\nAlthough the original University Act called for a Law Department, and\r\neven gave it first place in their scheme for organization after the\r\nLiterary College, the favorable time for its establishment did not\r\nappear for nearly twenty years. There were already a number of law\r\nschools in operation elsewhere, one of them at the University of\r\nPennsylvania dated as far back as 1790; but for the most part legal\r\neducation was haphazard and primitive. Candidates for the bar ordinarily\r\nprepared for practice by reading in a lawyer's office, a good old method\r\nthat perhaps has some merits, but one which did not, save in the case of\r\na teacher of exceptional qualifications, give a uniform preparation or\r\nan insight into the principles of legal philosophy. As the general level\r\nof education advanced, however, the advantages of some systematic\r\ninstruction in law became more and more apparent, and it was not long\r\nafter the establishment of the University before demands for a Law\r\nSchool began to be heard. This sentiment grew, in spite of the\r\nconservatism, and even active opposition, of the lawyers of the old\r\nschool who believed the established office method of education the only\r\npractical one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE OLD HOSPITALS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW HOSPITAL BUILDING (From the architect's plans)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAW BUILDING]\r\n\r\nFinally, in spite of the financial problem involved, the new Department\r\nwas formally opened in October, 1859, with an entering class of\r\nninety-two students. It had long been assumed that only one\r\nProfessorship would be required; but when the Board really faced the\r\nproblem it had a wider vision, and the first Faculty consisted of three\r\nmen. These have sometimes been called \"the great triumvirate,\" Judge\r\nJames V. Campbell, St. Paul's College, '41, of the State Supreme Court,\r\nwho became Marshall Professor of Law, with Common and Statute Law as his\r\nfield; Charles I. Walker, a practising lawyer of Detroit, Kent Professor\r\nof Pleading, Practice and Evidence; and Thomas McIntyre Cooley of\r\nAdrian, who came as Jay Professor of Equity Jurisprudence, Pleading, and\r\nPractice. These men had all been trained through the usual course of\r\n\"reading\" in a lawyer's office--all the higher education they received,\r\nwith the exception of Judge Campbell.\r\n\r\nNever has a law school started under more favorable auspices, certainly\r\nnever with such a Faculty. To the learning and personal character, as\r\nwell as to the ability as teachers, of these three men thousands of\r\ngraduates of the School ascribe their remarkable success in later life.\r\nJudge Campbell, the first Dean, was characterized by his wide, accurate,\r\nand scholarly knowledge; while the refinement of his literary style and\r\nhis stimulating personality made him one of the most delightful of\r\nlecturers. Professor Walker was the type of man who was willing to\r\nsacrifice one day a week out of a large and remunerative practice for\r\nthe education of young men in his profession. His interests extended\r\nbeyond his legal labors, for he was well known through his scholarly\r\ninvestigations in the early history of the State. His courses, which\r\nmight so easily have been perfunctory, were on a par with those of his\r\ndistinguished confreres, stimulating and profound and sometimes\r\npunctuated with a dry wit, well illustrated by his epigram that \"some\r\nmen live by their practice and some by their practices.\"\r\n\r\nThomas M. Cooley, the youngest one of this group and the only one to\r\nmake his home in Ann Arbor, probably, in his later years, gave more\r\ndistinction to the University than any other teacher upon its long\r\nrolls. He became known, not only nationally but internationally, for his\r\ngreat work on \"Constitutional Limitations\" which will probably always be\r\nthe standard work on the American Constitution. This appeared in 1868.\r\nHe was also the author of many other books, including a \"History of\r\nMichigan.\" During his service of twenty-one years on the State Supreme\r\nBench, the Court acquired a national reputation. At the time of his\r\ndeath he was a member of the first Interstate Commerce Commission. His\r\nhome, which stood on the site the Union now occupies, and which for nine\r\nyears was used as the Union Club House, was long a center of the\r\nintellectual and social life of Ann Arbor. One of his pupils, William R.\r\nDay, '70, now of the United States Supreme Court, says of him: \"Here was\r\na man of world-wide fame as a jurist--the author of a book which is at\r\nonce the greatest authority upon the subject of constitutional\r\nlimitations upon our government, and a classic in legal\r\nliterature--whose recreations seemed to consist in change of occupation,\r\nand whose energies seemed never to tire.\"\r\n\r\nThe enrolment in the new school grew with even greater rapidity than had\r\nthat of the Medical School during its first years. By 1911 the Law\r\nSchool, as it came to be known after 1910, had given 9,041 degrees,\r\nalmost equaling the 9,225 granted up to that time by the Literary\r\nCollege and more than double the 4,260 degrees granted by the Medical\r\nSchool. The balance of attendance, however, has been with the Literary\r\nCollege since 1897, when the requirement in the Law School was increased\r\nto three years. It must be understood, too, that any comparison of this\r\ncharacter between the Law and the Literary Departments can only be on a\r\nquantitative basis, for the traditional four years' work had always been\r\ndemanded in the Literary College; whereas in early days, the law course\r\nconsisted only of two terms of lectures of six months each, with only\r\none requisite for admission; that the candidates should be eighteen\r\nyears of age and of good moral character. Nevertheless these early\r\nstudents stood well in respect to ability, some \"were already practising\r\nlawyers, and others were on the verge of being admitted to the bar\"; men\r\nwho came to take advantage of the lectures before entering definitely\r\nupon practice. Only seniors were quizzed, but they were quizzed on\r\njunior as well as senior subjects, while at the end an oral examination\r\nwas given. If this ordeal was passed satisfactorily and an acceptable\r\nthesis presented, the candidate received his LL.B.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hinsdale in his \"History,\" in speaking of these earlier years,\r\nsaid: \"A feebler organization and a looser administration could hardly\r\nhave held the School together. Indeed, if the mark of a school is to be\r\nfound in organization and administration, then this was hardly a school\r\nat all; but if such mark is to be found in the ability of teachers, the\r\nvalue of the instruction given, and the enthusiasm of students, it was a\r\nschool of high order. In a word, it was the Professors and the\r\nconditions, not organization, administration, and discipline, that made\r\nthe School what it was.\"\r\n\r\nSince 1877, when it was announced that students henceforth were expected\r\nto be well grounded in at least a good English education, the\r\nrequirements in the Law School have been gradually raised; in fact one\r\nmay almost trace the reflection of the increasing requirements in the\r\nfluctuating attendance. Following a requirement that an examination in\r\nordinary high school branches must be passed by all students except\r\nthose who had completed a high school course, the standard of admission\r\nwas made in 1898 the same as for the admission to the old B.L. course in\r\nthe Literary Department. In 1884 the two annual terms which had\r\nheretofore made up the course were lengthened from six to nine months;\r\nand in 1886 a graduated course of instruction was introduced, resulting\r\nin the separation of the two classes which, up to that time, had always\r\nrecited together. In 1895, after due notice, a third year was added.\r\n\r\nThe last and perhaps most far-reaching steps in the history of the Law\r\nSchool were taken in 1912, when one year in the Literary College was\r\nrequired, and in 1915, when another year was added, making the law\r\ncourse one of five years. Other significant advances have also been made\r\nof late years; the establishment of the special degree of J.D. (Juris\r\nDoctor) for exceptional students, and particularly the addition of an\r\noptional sixth year of special studies for those who wished to carry\r\ntheir work further, leading to the degree of Master of Laws.\r\n\r\nWith these changes in the requirements has come also a revolution in\r\nmethods of teaching and even in the fundamental policies of the School.\r\nThere are three methods ordinarily applied in teaching law; the lecture,\r\nthe textbook, and the study of selected cases. The early courses were\r\nalmost entirely lectures, textbooks not appearing until 1879, while the\r\nstudy of cases, used somewhat even at the very first, has now become the\r\nprincipal method of establishing legal principles. The question is\r\nlargely one of the aim of a school, whether to make the student\r\nfamiliar with the actual rules and practice in the different parts of\r\nthe country so that he will be able to take up his profession, if only\r\nin a limited way, at once; or whether to emphasize fundamental\r\nprinciples and the evolutionary character of the law, which can best be\r\ndiscovered from the study of decisions and cases, in order to prepare\r\nfor the far more significant and useful career open to one who has the\r\nbackground, as well as the ordinary rules of law, upon which to base his\r\nactions. President Hutchins, when Dean of the Law School, emphasized\r\nthis when he said: \"The Law School of today should teach and should\r\nencourage the study of law in its larger sense.\" This policy has been\r\nconsistently developed by the present Dean, Henry M. Bates, '90, who not\r\nonly insists on the higher mission of the Law School in this regard but\r\nalso believes it \"must not only train men to be effective lawyers\r\nadhering steadfastly to high ethical standards, but it must also instil\r\ninto them a strong sense of responsibility to the community, and those\r\nideals of service which are among the oldest and finest but, perhaps,\r\nsometimes forgotten traditions of the bar.\"\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of the Law School has always remained relatively small in\r\nproportion to the numbers of students--largely because of the methods of\r\nteaching, and the absence, inherent in the subject, of any laboratory\r\nsave the practice court. A fourth professorship was created in 1866 and\r\nnamed after the Hon. Richard Fletcher of Boston, who had given his legal\r\nlibrary to the University. This was occupied in 1868 by Charles A. Kent,\r\nVermont, '52, who was Dean of the Department at the time of his\r\nresignation in 1886. The Fletcher Professorship has been held since 1897\r\nby Judge Victor H. Lane, '74_e_, '78_l_. A Tappan Professorship was\r\nestablished in 1879, an honor acknowledged with great pleasure by the\r\nfirst President, then living in Switzerland, and was held for four years\r\nby the Hon. Alpheus Felch, Bowdoin, '27, one of the most distinguished\r\ncitizens of the State, who had served as United States Senator,\r\nGovernor, and Regent. The Professorship passed eventually to Henry Wade\r\nRogers, '74, afterward Dean of the Yale Law School, and in 1903 to Henry\r\nM. Bates, '90. Mr. Walker resigned in 1876 and Judge Cooley in 1884,\r\nthough the latter continued to give lectures on special subjects and\r\nremained on the Faculty as Professor of American History and\r\nConstitutional Law. Judge Campbell became the first Dean of the\r\nDepartment but resigned in 1871, when he was succeeded by Judge Cooley.\r\nAfter the latter gave up his active duties Charles A. Kent became Dean,\r\nto be followed by Henry Wade Rogers, '74, in 1885; Jerome C. Knowlton,\r\n'75, in 1890; and Harry Burns Hutchins, '71, in 1895. The present Dean,\r\nHenry M. Bates, '90, succeeded Dr. Hutchins when he was elected to the\r\nPresidency of the University in 1910.\r\n\r\nThe Law Library, which contains over 40,000 volumes, is the largest of\r\nthe departmental collections. In addition to Judge Fletcher's early gift\r\nof eight hundred volumes, two other considerable gifts have added to its\r\nresources, the Buhl Collection, presented by Mr. C.H. Buhl of Detroit in\r\n1885, with a fund of $10,000 for additions to it, and the library\r\npresented by Judge S.T. Douglas of Detroit in 1898. The Library now\r\noccupies a large room at the south end of the second floor of the\r\npresent Law Building.\r\n\r\nThe first courses of the Law School were given in the old chapel in the\r\nNorth Wing, or Mason Hall, where the Law Library was installed with the\r\nGeneral Library above. This proved a most unsatisfactory arrangement\r\nfor the growing school and in 1863 a new Law Building was dedicated on\r\nthe northwest corner of the Campus. This building in turn quickly became\r\ninadequate for the needs of the still rapidly expanding department. Some\r\nrelief was given in 1872 by using the Chapel in the new University Hall,\r\nand again in 1882, when the University Library which had been housed up\r\nto this time in the Law Building was moved to its new quarters. The Law\r\nBuilding was remodeled and enlarged in 1893 and a second time in 1898,\r\nwhen it was almost completely made over into its present form.\r\n\r\nThe College of Engineering, the fourth of the larger divisions of the\r\nUniversity, was in fact the last to be established, as it was not until\r\n1895 that the Regents authorized its organization as an independent\r\ndepartment with Professor Charles E. Greene, Harvard, '62, as its first\r\nDean.\r\n\r\nThe history of the course in engineering, however, is almost as old as\r\nthe University, and really begins with the designation of a chair in\r\nCivil Engineering and Drawing in the article authorizing the University.\r\nThat was as far as the matter went, however, for the first fifteen\r\nyears, or until the appointment of Alexander Winchell in 1853 as\r\nProfessor of Physics and Civil Engineering. Physics is the science upon\r\nwhich the profession of the civil engineer rests and the two subjects\r\nwere closely associated in those days of small beginnings. There is\r\nlittle to indicate that Professor Winchell or his successor to the chair\r\nin 1855, William G. Peck, West Point, '44, did much to advance the\r\nengineering half of their charge. But with the coming of DeVolson Wood\r\nas Assistant Professor, immediately upon his graduation in 1857 from\r\nRensselaer Polytechnic, the cause of engineering was properly presented\r\nto the students. Though the fourth institution in this country to offer\r\ncourses in engineering, the first two students were not graduated until\r\n1860, so that actually Michigan became the sixth institution in America\r\nto grant degrees in that branch of scientific training.\r\n\r\nProfessor Charles S. Denison, whose long service in the University began\r\nas an instructor just before Professor Wood's resignation, pays a\r\ntribute to his sturdy and at the same time genial character, his\r\npowerful intellect, and singularly virile influence on his students. He\r\nshowed remarkable energy and administrative ability, in spite of many\r\ndifficulties and a general lack of understanding of his aims in\r\ntechnical education, characteristic of those days. It is told of him\r\nthat he even recommended an adaptation of one of the professors' houses\r\non the Campus to the needs of the work in engineering, exactly thirty\r\nyears before it was actually done. While he was here a course in\r\nmilitary engineering was organized in 1862 and he delivered a course of\r\nlectures on that subject, but after the war it was abandoned. A similar\r\nfate overtook the School of Mines established in 1864-65, owing to the\r\ndesire of the residents of the Northern Peninsula to have a state\r\ninstitution in that section, although a number of degrees in mining\r\nengineering were granted. A course in mechanical engineering was also\r\nauthorized by the Regents in 1868, one of the very first to be organized\r\nin this country, but the degree was abolished two years later and the\r\ncourse was merged with civil engineering. One of the last acts of\r\nProfessor Wood, before his resignation to accept a similar chair at\r\nStevens Institute of Technology, was to present to the Regents a\r\ndetailed plan for a School of Engineering and Technology as a fourth\r\ndepartment of the University--foreshadowing the action taken\r\ntwenty-three years later when engineering was made a separate\r\ndepartment in the University.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Charles Ezra Greene, Harvard, '62, Mass. Inst.\r\nTechnology, '68, in 1872 marks a definite period in the history of this\r\ndepartment. He found himself associated with two other men who had been\r\ninstructors for a short period under Professor Wood, J.B. Davis, '68_e_,\r\nAssistant Professor of Civil Engineering, who became Professor of\r\nGeodesy and Surveying in 1891, and Charles S. Denison, Vermont, '70, who\r\nwas to be in later years Professor of Stereotomy, Mechanism, and\r\nDrawing. These men saw the Department grow almost to its present\r\nproportions, and, as the first Faculty, formed a most harmonious\r\ncombination of unusually varied elements. Professor Greene was a scholar\r\nand scientist who had a wide reputation as an engineer and an author;\r\nProfessor Davis, on the contrary, was a practical man, a genius, whose\r\nlove of the outdoors and fatherly care of his \"boys\" even extended to\r\ntheir \"rubbers\" on wet days, while his homely and wise sayings endeared\r\nhim to every student. Professor Denison was a bachelor, small and very\r\nparticular in personal appearance, who was long known by the students as\r\n\"Little Lord Chesterfield,\" but an able teacher who was loved for his\r\nbig heart and his very mannerisms. A course in mechanical engineering\r\nwas again inaugurated in 1881 when Mortimer E. Cooley, Annapolis, '78,\r\nAssistant Engineer, U.S.N., was detailed to the University by the Navy\r\nDepartment and became the first Professor of Mechanical Engineering. In\r\n1885 he resigned from the Navy and definitely cast his lot with the\r\nUniversity, becoming Dean of the College of Engineering in February,\r\n1904, after the death of Professor Greene in October, 1903. At the same\r\ntime Professor Davis became Associate Dean and maintained an intimate\r\nand paternal care over the students until his retirement in 1910.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Electrical Engineering was organized in 1889, under\r\nthe charge of Henry S. Carhart, Wesleyan, '69, Professor of Physics, and\r\none instructor, George W. Patterson, Yale, '84, who became the first\r\nProfessor of Electrical Engineering in May, 1905. In 1899 a course in\r\nNaval Architecture and Marine Engineering was created with Herbert C.\r\nSadler, Glasgow, '93, as the first Professor. The following year the\r\nfirst degree was conferred in a new Department of Chemical Engineering,\r\nand in 1902 Edward DeMille Campbell, '86, became head of the new\r\ndivision as Professor of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe first plan for the University called for a Professorship of\r\nEngineering and Architecture, but no attention was paid to the latter\r\nsubject until the appointment of W.L.B. Jenney, to the Professorship of\r\nArchitecture in 1876. Appropriations failed, however, and the chair was\r\ndiscontinued in 1880, not to be revived until 1906, when a Department of\r\nArchitecture was organized under the charge of Emil Lorch, A.M.,\r\nHarvard, '03, with the two departments associated under the title of the\r\nDepartment (later Colleges) of Engineering and Architecture. Within\r\nrecent years special courses have been organized leading to degrees in\r\nArchitectural Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Aeronautical\r\nEngineering, as well as special groups of courses in such branches as\r\nsanitary, transportation, automobile, hydro-mechanical, industrial, and\r\ngas engineering and paper manufacturing. A reorganization of the\r\nnumerous degrees given at one time in the Engineering College has now\r\nreduced the degrees to two, B.S. in Engineering and B.S. in\r\nArchitecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ENGINEERING QUADRANGLE]\r\n\r\nOriginally the work in engineering was centered in what is now the old\r\nsouth wing of University Hall. The first building on the Campus used\r\nexclusively for the engineering courses was the first section of the\r\nEngineering Laboratories built in 1881-82, as the result of the\r\ninsistence of Dr. Frieze, then Acting President, that an unexpended\r\nappropriation of $2,500 be used immediately. At short intervals further\r\nadditions were made and in 1900 the building, now known as the\r\nEngineering Shops, assumed its present form. In 1895 a further extension\r\nof the work in engineering was required, and the adjacent campus\r\nresidence was remodeled for the purpose. This proved inadequate almost\r\nbefore completion and in 1902 the construction of the present\r\nEngineering Building was authorized. Standing across the southeast\r\ncorner of the Campus and with the diagonal walk carried through it under\r\na picturesque archway, this is one of the University's largest buildings\r\nand forms, with its two wings, and the Engineering Shops and the old\r\nHeating Plant, a square known as the Engineering Quadrangle. It was\r\ncompleted in 1904, but a further addition was necessitated in 1909, so\r\nthat it now has a floor space of about 136,000 square feet, and cost\r\nwith equipment about $400,000. In the basement of the long wing which\r\nextends down East University Avenue is the naval experimental tank, 300\r\nfeet long and 22 feet wide, in which models of various types of ships\r\nare tested by the Department of Marine Engineering. The only other tank\r\nof this character in the United States is at the Washington Navy Yard,\r\nand the facilities of the University's tank, therefore, were used\r\nextensively by the Government during the late war.\r\n\r\nThe development of the College of Pharmacy, actually the fourth separate\r\ndepartment in the University, is closely interwoven with that of the\r\nDepartment of Chemistry. Its history has already been in part suggested\r\nin the references to the growth of the Chemical Laboratory and the\r\nappointment of Dr. Prescott as the first Dean of the Department, or\r\nlater, College, of Pharmacy. At first the study of chemistry was\r\npresented only in lectures and a few simple demonstrations. Dr. Douglas,\r\nhowever, was among the pioneers in this country in realizing that the\r\nway to teach the subject was to help the students perform their own\r\nexperiments, and accordingly he established a small laboratory for\r\nspecial students in the Medical Building. From this grew the idea of a\r\nlaboratory building which was finally completed in October, 1857, at a\r\ncost of $3,450, the first building erected in America for this purpose,\r\nwith facilities which were, in President Tappan's words, \"unsurpassed by\r\nanything of the kind in the country.\" Even then it proved almost at once\r\ntoo small, and a long series of enlargements came at intervals of about\r\nfive years, until finally the new Chemistry Building was completed in\r\n1910.\r\n\r\nAll the work in chemistry in the different Departments was, from the\r\nfirst, provided for in this building, with no distinction between\r\nacademic and professional students except such as the special courses\r\nrequire. The work in pharmacy grew naturally with the Department of\r\nChemistry. Following its establishment in 1868, the course eventually\r\ngrew into a separate Department, which became independent in 1876. The\r\nschool prospered under the wise and scholarly administration of its\r\nfirst Dean, Dr. Albert B. Prescott, and it was soon recognized as one of\r\nthe best in the country. The early entrance requirements were only a\r\ngood knowledge of the English language, but soon a high school course\r\nbecame requisite. The curriculum, which at first consisted of two years'\r\nwork, was eventually lengthened to three years in 1917-18, leading to\r\nthe degree of Ph.C; while for a regular four years' course a B.S. in\r\nPharmacy is granted.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Dr. Prescott in 1905, Dr. Julius O. Schlotterbeck,\r\n'91, succeeded him as Dean of the College. Dr. Schlotterbeck died in\r\n1917, and Professor Alviso B. Stevens, '75_p_, became Dean until his\r\nretirement in 1919.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of a Department of Homeopathy in the University, which,\r\nas has been noted, did not come without a struggle, was finally effected\r\nin 1875; though only after long opposition from the Medical Faculty and\r\nthe regular medical profession throughout the State. The first Faculty,\r\nwhich was appointed soon after the Legislature finally authorized the\r\nestablishment of the School, was composed of Dr. Samuel A. Jones,\r\nPennsylvania Homeopathic Medical College, '61, of Englewood, N.J., who\r\nwas Dean and Professor of Materia Medica and Therapeutics, and Dr. John\r\nC. Morgan, Pennsylvania Medical College, '52, who took the chair of\r\nTheory and Practice. Dr. Jones soon became one of the most interesting\r\nand stimulating figures in the life of the University. Small and spare\r\nin physique, he possessed an extraordinarily keen mind and an interest\r\nin literature and learning far beyond the limits of his profession. His\r\nlibrary, which was particularly rich in material on Thoreau and Carlyle,\r\nbecame upon his death in 1912 one of the valuable acquisitions of the\r\nUniversity Library.\r\n\r\nThe Faculty grew slowly as new students came, though the Department\r\nnever became as large as the older school, the record enrolment being 79\r\nin 1892. The Department eventually found that the original quarters in\r\none of the two professorial residences on the north side of the Campus,\r\nto which a long wing had been added at the rear, were inadequate, and in\r\n1900 the present Homeopathic Hospital was erected opposite the northeast\r\ncorner of the Campus. To this a nurses' home was added later, and in\r\n1918 an adequate children's ward. An effort made in 1893 by Dr. H.L.\r\nObetz, Cleveland Homeopathic Hospital College, '74, at that time Dean,\r\nto amalgamate the two schools proved unsuccessful, and eventually led to\r\nhis resignation and a reorganization that necessitated the resignation\r\nof the remainder of the Faculty. A law passed in the same year by the\r\nLegislature reversing its previous position and directing that the\r\nSchool be removed to Detroit, was successfully resisted by the Regents\r\non the same ground that had already been urged in the case of the\r\nregular school. Dr. E.C. Franklin, M.D., University of New York, '46,\r\nfollowed Dr. Jones as Dean in 1878. Dr. T.P. Wilson, Western Homeopathic\r\nCollege, '57, succeeded him in 1881 and Dr. H.L. Obetz in 1885. After\r\nthe reorganization in 1895 mentioned above, Dr. Wilbert B. Hinsdale,\r\nHiram College, '75, the present Dean, was appointed, and the later and\r\nmore untroubled history of the School may be said to date from that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DENTAL BUILDING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOMEOPATHIC HOSPITAL AND CHILDREN'S WARD]\r\n\r\nThough the incorporation of a Dental College in the University was\r\nsuggested as far back as 1865, the first steps were not taken until 1873\r\nwhen the Michigan State Dental Association requested the establishment\r\nof a dental course as soon as possible. This was supplemented two years\r\nlater by a similar petition to the Legislature on the part of a large\r\nnumber of citizens of the State, which led to the appropriation of the\r\nsum of $3,000 for each of the next two years for the establishment of a\r\nDepartment of Dentistry in the University. The Regents thereupon took\r\naction in 1875, establishing the College, and in addition to the\r\nfacilities offered by the Medical Department and Chemical Laboratory,\r\ncreated two Professorships in Dentistry. A little later Dr. Jonathan\r\nTaft, Ohio College of Dental Surgery, '50, of Cincinnati, was appointed\r\nProfessor of Principles and Practice of Operative Dentistry and Dr. John\r\nA. Watling, Ohio College of Dental Surgery, '60, Professor of Clinical\r\nand Mechanical Dentistry. The precedent of long standing in the other\r\nprofessional departments was followed, both in the matter of entrance\r\nrequirements and the course, which consisted for many years of two terms\r\nof six months. This was lengthened, however, in 1884 to nine months and\r\nin 1899 a third year was added.\r\n\r\nThe Dental College first occupied a portion of the Homeopathic Building\r\non the north side of the Campus; later it was removed to one of the old\r\nprofessors' houses on the south side which had been enlarged and fitted\r\nup for its reception. Upon the removal of the University Hospital from\r\nthe Campus in 1891, the building it had occupied, which it may be\r\nremembered was an adaptation and extension of one of the residences on\r\nthe north, became the home of the school. Never well adapted for this\r\npurpose and becoming entirely too small with the rapid growth of the\r\nCollege, a new building eventually became necessary. This led to the\r\nconstruction of the present Dental Building, one of the most completely\r\nequipped structures for the purpose in the United States. It was\r\ndedicated in May, 1909, and cost, with equipment, over $150,000. The\r\ndepartment has grown consistently from the first year, when the\r\nattendance was twenty students, the lowest in its history, to 353 in\r\n1915-16. Dr. Taft was Dean of the College from 1875 to the time of his\r\ndeath in 1903. Dr. Cyrenus Darling, '81_m_, of the Medical School then\r\nbecame Acting Dean, resigning active work four years later to be\r\nsucceeded by Dr. Nelville S. Hoff, Ohio College of Dental Surgery, '76,\r\nProfessor of Prosthetic Dentistry since 1903, who received the full\r\ntitle in 1911. Upon his resignation in 1918, Dr. Marcus L. Ward, '02_d_,\r\nsucceeded to the position.\r\n\r\nThe Summer Session was first established by the Regents in 1900 as a\r\nseparate division of the University. Courses in the summer had been\r\ngiven since 1894 under the direction of a committee from the Faculty of\r\nLiterature, Science, and the Arts, but the Regents had assumed no real\r\nresponsibility for this work and the fact that the chairman and all the\r\nmembers of the committee, save one, were of the rank of instructor\r\nindicates the minor place it assumed in university affairs. With a\r\nreorganization in 1900 under the chairmanship of Professor John O. Reed,\r\n'85, of the Department of Physics, a new life was given to the School.\r\nFrom that time it grew rapidly, until in the summer of 1919 it had an\r\nenrolment of almost 2,000, including students in the Law School, Medical\r\nSchool, Engineering College, and a summer library course, though the\r\nmajority, of course, were enrolled in the Literary College. When\r\nProfessor Reed became Dean of the Literary Department in 1907, Professor\r\nJohn R. Effinger, '91, became Dean of the Summer Session. After the\r\ndeath of his predecessor, he in turn became Dean of the Literary\r\nCollege, and Edward H. Kraus, Syracuse, '96, Professor of Mineralogy,\r\nwho had been Secretary, took his place as administrative head of the\r\nSummer Session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA STATE UNIVERSITY AS A CENTER OF LEARNING\r\n\r\n\r\nMichigan's position as a state university has been strongly reflected in\r\nits ideals and policies. It could not be otherwise. But this\r\nrelationship, the source of its strength in many aspects, has also\r\ncarried with it certain dangers. The University has a two-fold function:\r\nit must teach the youth of the State and the Nation; but to do this\r\neffectively, it must also aim to do its share in enlarging the field of\r\nknowledge by encouraging scholarship and research on the part of members\r\nof the Faculties as well as by a certain proportion of the more advanced\r\nstudents. It is this latter function that is too easily overlooked in\r\nthe demand for the ordinary and more \"practical\" courses which\r\nnecessarily form so large a part of the modern curriculum. Yet even the\r\nmost elementary college work cannot be given properly unless the\r\ninstructor is in touch with the latest developments and discoveries in\r\nhis own field, and this familiarity only comes through research, on his\r\nown part or by his colleagues.\r\n\r\nBut more than this the University, if it be worthy of the name, owes it\r\nto the State to be a leader and a guide in the development of the\r\nhighest cultural standards; it should be a reservoir upon which the\r\npeople of the State can draw for truth and guidance in the difficult\r\nproblems of modern life. This cannot come without a strong emphasis on\r\noriginal and productive scholarship.\r\n\r\nIt has always been one of the sources of the University's strength that\r\nthis fact was understood, almost from the first, and that the claims of\r\ntrue scholarship and research have been increasingly recognized. It has\r\nbeen shown that in its first years Michigan was to all intents a replica\r\nin the West of the older and conservative colleges of the East; though\r\nthere was a certain idealism and progressive spirit that tempered even\r\nthen this recognition of long-established precedent. The West was\r\nliberal and disposed to create its own institutions upon a new basis, so\r\nthat when the new ideals in education began to make themselves felt,\r\nabout the middle of the nineteenth century, Michigan was ready for them.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of Dr. Tappan the movement, already foreshadowed by the\r\nLegislature in the very terms under which the University was organized,\r\ngained a new impetus and effective guidance, and it was not long before\r\na remarkable series of constructive measures in the interest of higher\r\neducation began. Most of them have been mentioned elsewhere, but it may\r\nnot be amiss to suggest some of them once more; such as the emphasis on\r\nmodern science, with the parallel classical and scientific courses\r\nwithin the academic department; the wide range of elections eventually\r\nintroduced; the early inauguration of professional and graduate schools;\r\nthe introduction of seminary and laboratory methods; the admission of\r\nwomen; the diploma system of admission from the high schools; and the\r\nrecognition of the claims of special students.\r\n\r\nUntil within recent years also, the University had no marking system.\r\nThe students were merely \"passed,\" \"not passed,\" or \"conditioned.\" This\r\nundoubtedly stimulated interest in study and scholarship for its own\r\nsake in the case of many students, though, in the absence of any of the\r\nusual college honors it encouraged a certain level of mediocrity in\r\nothers. The change in the system and the introduction of the Phi Beta\r\nKappa Society and similar organizations after 1907 resulted in a marked\r\nalteration in the attitude toward study and has undoubtedly raised\r\nappreciably the general level of scholarship.\r\n\r\nThus, though the University throughout its whole history necessarily has\r\nhad to recognize the first claims of the students for instruction, often\r\nof a somewhat elementary character, there have always been influences\r\nwhich have kept the ideals of higher scholarship constantly in view. In\r\nthe older days the idea of research in its modern sense was hardly\r\nunderstood; but as the atmosphere of European learning began to pervade\r\nAmerican academic life the double function of a true university came to\r\nbe more clearly recognized. Not only were facilities for research\r\ndeveloped, but the scientific spirit, which refused to accept the\r\nlimitations long established, and sought new truths, or new\r\ninterpretations of old principles, became the order of the day.\r\n\r\nThis was the ideal of Michigan's first President. But in his time the\r\nneed for less advanced work was too pressing, the foundations had to be\r\nlaid; though his efforts bore fruit long after he left, the victim in\r\npart of his high ideals of scholarship. Even in his time, however,\r\ncertain steps were taken, aside from his effort to inaugurate true\r\ngraduate study, which had a vital bearing on the development of research\r\nwork in the future. These came through the establishment of the\r\nAstronomical Observatory and the Chemical Laboratory. Dr. Bruennow, the\r\nfirst Professor of Astronomy, came to Michigan inspired by a prospect of\r\nscholarly leadership and the results of his investigations and those of\r\nhis pupil and successor, Professor Watson, gave to the University a\r\nworld-wide reputation among scholars. The same was true, though perhaps\r\nto a lesser degree, of the Department of Chemistry, whose little\r\nLaboratory, the first separate building for that purpose in America,\r\nattracted advanced students from all quarters--the enrolment of special\r\nstudents sometimes reaching seventy, of whom at least some were doing\r\nwork corresponding to the graduate courses of the present time. The\r\nstudents of this department as a whole have had a profound influence\r\nupon the development of the industrial and commercial resources of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nWith the succession of Dr. Haven to the Presidency, the emphasis was\r\nthrown almost entirely on the immediate and practical problems of\r\ngeneral instruction. He was not a scholar in the modern sense, as was\r\nDr. Tappan, and the University's first requirement was fairly obvious.\r\nBut the higher function of the University was not forgotten by the\r\nleading men of the Faculty. President Hutchins tells how he was drawn to\r\nMichigan in 1867 from his hillside farm home in Vermont by the\r\nreputation of Michigan's Faculty. He had become greatly dissatisfied\r\nwith the educational facilities offered in the East, though he did not\r\nknow exactly what he wanted to do. Just at this time his father returned\r\nfrom a business trip in the West and reported that he had found the\r\nright place for him in the University of Michigan. The young man\r\nreplied, \"Oh, I know about Ann Arbor.\" The father was somewhat surprised\r\nand asked how that happened. \"Well,\" said Michigan's future President,\r\n\"I have noticed that the editor of the Virgil I study is Professor\r\nFrieze, at Ann Arbor, and in Greek there is a Professor Boise; my French\r\ntextbooks are by Professor Fasquelle; while in mathematics my books are\r\nby Professor Olney. It seems to me that must be a pretty good\r\nuniversity.\" So despite dire warning, from his grandmother as to the\r\ndangers from the desperadoes of the West, to say nothing of the Indians,\r\nhe came to Michigan; drawn by the scholarly work of the men of that\r\nearly Faculty, as were hundreds of other students.\r\n\r\nIt will of course be suggested that this work on the part of the Faculty\r\nwas not \"research\" in the modern sense, though it was just as truly\r\n\"productive scholarship.\" And it was what was so regarded in those days.\r\nBesides it was evident that the University was amply fulfilling one of\r\nits great functions in laying the foundations for the present system of\r\nhigher education. The teachers of the secondary schools as well as the\r\ncolleges looked to these strong men for guidance and they found the\r\nsupport they needed. Their books were the necessary basis for the\r\ntraining of future scholars.\r\n\r\nThe gradual broadening of the University curriculum and its effect upon\r\ngraduate study has already been mentioned. There was one development,\r\nhowever, which deserves special mention here. This was the inauguration\r\nof the so-called \"University System.\" President Tappan had laid down the\r\nprinciple that a student should be able to study \"what he pleases, and\r\nto any extent he pleases,\" and gradually the University had made such a\r\ncourse possible through the introduction of electives and the admission\r\nof special students, a privilege that was greatly appreciated by many\r\nstudents of mature years, who, after entering as special students, often\r\nremained to take a degree. In 1882 there came a third step in the\r\nremoval of any fixed requirement as to the last two years of work. Such\r\nstudents as elected to follow the new plan known as the \"University\r\nSystem,\" were permitted to select, subject to approval, the general\r\nlines of study to be pursued during this period with a prescribed\r\nexamination at the end. This work was to be in charge of a committee\r\ncomposed of the Professors in the subjects chosen, and was designed to\r\ngive the students the advantages of such specialization as was suitable,\r\nas soon as practicable. The plan, however, did not prove popular, most\r\nof the students preferring the credit system; but the scheme\r\n\"constituted for a time the constitutional basis of the Graduate School,\r\nin so far as that School had any real existence.\" Probably the same\r\ngeneral purpose, as far as preparation for the professions was\r\nconcerned, was served at a later period by the combining of the literary\r\nand medical, and later, the law courses, enabling the student to begin\r\nhis professional studies after his second year. Elsewhere such\r\nspecialization as seemed desirable was attained after 1901, through the\r\nregular elections, when practically the whole curriculum was thrown open\r\nto general election, subject of course to a certain sequence of courses.\r\n\r\nThe professional departments have had a marked influence upon the\r\nUniversity's standing as a center of learning. This is particularly true\r\nof the Medical School, which naturally emphasized the value of scholarly\r\ntraining and investigation from the first. It is probably not an\r\nexaggeration to say that it was the impetus given by the Medical Faculty\r\nwhich was responsible for the high reputation the University enjoyed\r\nfrom the first, particularly in the sciences. To this fortunate\r\ndevelopment the two recruits from the Literary Faculty, Dr. Sager, who\r\nhad been Professor of Botany and Zooelogy, and Dr. Douglas, who served as\r\nProfessor of Chemistry in both departments, contributed especially,\r\nthough the influence of the other members of the Medical Faculty, more\r\ninterested perhaps in the strictly professional aspects of their\r\nwork, cannot be overlooked. These men were alive to the value of\r\noriginal investigation, their field offered too many opportunities to be\r\nneglected by scholars of their caliber, and it was therefore in the\r\nMedical School that the first research laboratories were developed. As\r\nthe numbers in the Medical Department and its prestige increased, this\r\ninfluence grew, so that it may be said that for many years the strongest\r\nimpulse toward research and the highest scholarship, particularly in the\r\nnew fields of science, came from the men of the Medical Faculty. Nor has\r\nthis influence ever weakened, though the eventual establishment of\r\nadvanced courses and the recognition of research in all departments has\r\ntended to make it less conspicuous than in the early days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE INTERIOR OF HILL AUDITORIUM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE MAIN READING ROOM IN THE NEW LIBRARY]\r\n\r\nWith the Law Department it was somewhat different. The old-fashioned\r\nconception of the law as a formal body of doctrine, fixed and\r\nunchangeable, tended in itself to limit original effort, though Judge\r\nCooley's great work, with its high scholarship and profound learning,\r\nadded greatly to the reputation of the University. Of recent years,\r\nhowever, there has been a change in the attitude towards the teaching of\r\nlaw. It has come to be recognized that our law is a changing and\r\ndeveloping force, and that the adaptation of fundamental legal\r\nprinciples to the advancing demands of modern society, both through\r\nlegislation and through judicial decision, furnishes a field for\r\nresearch and investigation which demands the highest type of scholarship\r\nand training. The modern law student seeks the principles of his science\r\nthrough a careful study of the cases themselves, and no longer accepts a\r\ndogmatic statement of the law as laid down in textbook and lecture. This\r\nchange in the legal curriculum, which is little less than revolutionary,\r\nis really based upon scholarship and research on the part of every\r\nstudent, and is reflected in the preoccupation of every law student in\r\nhis work. Gone are the days when the Law Department was the resort of\r\nthose who could not succeed in the other departments.\r\n\r\nIn more practical and especially industrial fields the College of\r\nEngineering has also contributed its share, though it was considered a\r\npart of the Literary Department throughout all its early years. While\r\nits aim is to train men in technical branches, the field of\r\ninvestigation has been by no means neglected, even if the questions\r\nstudied have largely borne specifically upon such problems as railway\r\nand steel construction, the functioning of various types of engines,\r\nmarine design, the various forms of the utilization of electrical\r\nenergy, and the many applications of science to industry undertaken by\r\nthe Department of Chemical Engineering. That this work has been\r\nappreciated is evidenced by the increasing number of fellowships for\r\noriginal research maintained by many private corporations, and by the\r\nsuggestion and tentative establishment in 1920 of a general Department\r\nof Industrial Research maintained through co-operation by the\r\nmanufacturers of the State with the Faculty of the Engineering College.\r\nIt is specially stipulated that the results of whatever investigations\r\nare made under these auspices are to be made public for the benefit of\r\nthe people of the State, irrespective of the source of income.\r\n\r\nThis developing spirit led to the formation of a Research Club which has\r\nhad a profound though quiet influence in the growth of scholarship in\r\nthe University. The Club meets at stated periods in the Histological\r\nLaboratory in the Medical Building, a fact in itself significant of the\r\nstrong support the organization has always had from the Medical Faculty,\r\nand ordinarily listens to two papers, contributed by members. The aim\r\nis to present the problem under consideration clearly and with as little\r\nemphasis as possible on its technical aspects, a purpose often more\r\nsuccessfully realized, according to some of the members, by the men who\r\nhave been especially successful in their particular fields. The\r\ndistinguishing mark of this organization is its general and inclusive\r\ncharacter; similar clubs elsewhere are more apt to emphasize certain\r\nparticular and related subjects, and to that extent fail to represent\r\neffectively the united scholarly effort of the institution. Many of the\r\npapers first read in the Research Club have formed the basis of reports\r\npublished subsequently in the proceedings of scientific bodies which\r\nhave attracted wide attention. Particularly noteworthy have been the\r\ncelebrations of the anniversaries of distinguished scholars and authors,\r\nthe significance of whose life and works has been emphasized in the\r\npapers presented before the members. Similar in aim is the Junior\r\nResearch Club, whose membership is composed of the younger men of the\r\nFaculties of the University.\r\n\r\nWith the reorganization of the Graduate School in 1912, there came a new\r\nemphasis on the publication of works of scholarship by the University.\r\nWithin a short time several series of \"University of Michigan Studies\"\r\nwere established; and to these new volumes are continually being added,\r\nwhich have contributed greatly to the University's place in the world of\r\nlearning. Though certain other universities, notably Harvard, Cornell,\r\nand Chicago, had previously established similar series, Michigan has\r\nbeen well to the fore among American universities in thus systematically\r\ngiving to the world in adequate form the results of certain aspects of\r\nthe work carried on within her walls. Particularly in certain cases she\r\nhas been peculiarly fortunate in the extraordinary value and\r\nsignificance of the original material thus published.\r\n\r\nThe first series established was known as the \"Humanistic Series,\"\r\nissued under the general editorial supervision of Professor Francis W.\r\nKelsey of the Department of Latin, who has been indefatigable in\r\nsecuring material and funds for this work. The publications in the\r\npresent list of sixteen volumes include three on Roman history and\r\nphilology made up for the most part of monographs by various members of\r\nthe Faculty, or graduates of the University, two edited by Professor\r\nHenry A. Sanders, and one by Professor C.L. Meader. Another volume deals\r\nwith \"Word Formation in Provencal\" and is by Professor Edward L. Adams.\r\nSomewhat different in scope are two volumes on Greek vases, or\r\n\"Lekythoi,\" by Arthur Fairbanks, at one time Professor of Greek in the\r\nUniversity, and now Director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nFive volumes in this series have dealt with various manuscripts and\r\nobjects of ancient art in the collections of the late Charles L. Freer\r\nof Detroit. The two by Professor Sanders, dealing with four very early\r\nbiblical manuscripts, which include Deuteronomy and Joshua, the Psalms,\r\nthe four Gospels, and fragments of the Epistle of Paul, aroused\r\nworldwide interest among scholars when they appeared, particularly as\r\nthey were accompanied by sumptuous volumes of photogravure fac-similes\r\nprepared by Mr. Freer and distributed by the University to the leading\r\nlibraries throughout the world. As these manuscripts, which were\r\ndiscovered in Egypt and are among the very earliest known, were thus\r\nmade available for study in a way heretofore almost unknown, the\r\nUniversity gained incalculably.\r\n\r\nOther volumes in the series include descriptions of certain Coptic\r\nmanuscripts, documents from the Cairo Genizah, some Eastern Christian\r\npaintings in the Freer collection, and a gold treasure found in Egypt.\r\n\r\nTranslations of ancient scientific and mathematical treatises by\r\nProfessors John G. Winter and L.C. Karpinski are also to be found in two\r\nother volumes of this series, while certain studies in Roman Law and\r\nadministration by Professors A.E. Boak and J.H. Drake and a discussion\r\nof \"Greek Themes in Modern Musical Settings,\" by Professor A.A. Stanley,\r\nbring the volumes issued down to the present time. Accompanying this\r\nseries are a number of Humanistic Papers, including a discussion and\r\nsymposium on the value of classical training in American education, and\r\na biography of Professor George S. Morris by Professor R.M. Wenley. Two\r\nvolumes in a scientific series have also appeared: \"The Circulation and\r\nSleep,\" by Professor J.A. Shepard of the Department of Psychology, and\r\n\"Studies in Divergent Series and Summability,\" by Professor W.B. Ford of\r\nthe Department of Mathematics. Two volumes of the Publications of the\r\nAstronomical Observatory, dealing with the spectroscopic investigations\r\nfor which the Observatory is now particularly well equipped, have also\r\nappeared. Also to be noted are four numbers of a series of Publications\r\nby the Physical Laboratory and seventy-two \"Occasional Papers from the\r\nMuseum of Zooelogy,\" as well as four volumes in a \"University of Michigan\r\nHistorical Series,\" including \"A History of the Presidents' Cabinets,\"\r\n\"The English Rule in Gascony, 1199-1259,\" \"The Color Line in Ohio,\" and\r\n\"The Senate and Treaties (1789-1817),\" (the last by Professor J.R.\r\nHayden), and two volumes in a series of Economic Studies. A \"History of\r\nthe Chemical Laboratory,\" by Professor E.D. Campbell, should also be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time there have been issued compilations of the\r\npublications of members of the University Faculties. These have shown an\r\never-increasing body of books, articles, and reviews which may be taken\r\nas another concrete evidence of the activity of the members of the\r\nFaculty in their various fields. The first two of these lists were\r\nissued through the medium of a little informative sheet issued for the\r\nUniversity for some years by the Alumni Association, known as the\r\n_News-Letter_. The data were far from complete but the published total\r\nwas not unimpressive. Later the University Library took up the work,\r\nwhile the last two lists of this character were made by Dean A.H. Lloyd,\r\nof the Graduate School, as regular University Bulletins. These cover the\r\nperiod from July 1, 1909 to June 30, 1919 and include over one hundred\r\nvolumes exclusive of ordinary handbooks and textbooks. These two lists\r\ngive some 1,700 titles.\r\n\r\nWhile it is impossible to mention even a small portion of the\r\npublications of more than usual interest during the last fifteen years,\r\nthere are a few that may be mentioned as evidence of the influence of\r\nthe University in the world of letters and scholarships. These, omitting\r\nnumerous textbooks and aside from the volumes issued in the University\r\nHumanistic Series and others, include, \"The Acropolis at Athens,\"\r\n(1908), by Professor M.L. D'Ooge; \"The Will to Doubt, an Essay in\r\nPhilosophy for the General Thinker,\" (1907), by Professor A.H. Lloyd; a\r\nseries of works on psychology by Professor W.B. Pillsbury, including\r\n\"Attention,\" (1908); \"The Psychology of Reasoning,\" (1910); \"The\r\nFundamentals of Psychology,\" (1916), and \"The Psychology of Nationality\r\nand Internationalism,\" (1919). Professor R.M. Wenley, head of the\r\nDepartment of Philosophy has also written a number of books which\r\ninclude, \"Modern Thought and the Crisis in Belief,\" (1909); \"Kant,\"\r\n(1910); \"The Anarchist Ideal,\" (1913); and the \"Life of George S.\r\nMorris,\" (1917). Professor R.W. Sellars of the same Department has\r\nwritten, \"Critical Realism,\" (1916); \"The Essentials of Logic,\" (1917);\r\n\"The Essentials of Philosophy,\" (1917); and \"The Next Step in Religion,\"\r\n(1918), while Professor D.H. Parker is the author of two volumes\r\nentitled \"The Self and Nature,\" (1917), and \"The Principles of\r\nAEsthetics,\" (1920).\r\n\r\nThe Department of History includes on its Faculty a number of men whose\r\nbooks have attracted more than a passing attention. Professor C.H. Van\r\nTyne has written among other books, including several textbooks, \"The\r\nLoyalists in the American Revolution,\" (1902), and \"The American\r\nRevolution,\" (1905); while others to be mentioned are Professor A.L.\r\nCross, whose \"History of England and Greater Britain\" appeared in 1914;\r\nProfessor U.B. Phillips, \"The Life of Robert Toombs,\" (1913), and\r\n\"American Negro Slavery,\" (1918); and Professor E.R. Turner, \"The Negro\r\nin Pennsylvania,\" (1911), and \"Ireland and England, in the Past and at\r\nPresent,\" (1919).\r\n\r\nProfessor Henry C. Adams has written a number of books on economics and\r\naccounting, particularly \"American Railway Accounting,\" (1918). It is\r\nworthy of note that he spent two years in China installing a system of\r\nrailway accounting for the Chinese government. Other volumes which\r\nshould be noted are: \"Social Problems,\" (1918), by Professor Charles H.\r\nCooley; \"Characteristics of Existing Glaciers,\" (1911), and \"Earth\r\nFeatures and their Meaning,\" (1912), by Professor William H. Hobbs;\r\n\"The Hindu-Arabic Numerals,\" (1911), by Professor L.C. Karpinski, and\r\nthe \"Catalogue of the Stearns Collection of Musical Instruments,\"\r\n(1919), prepared by Professor A.A. Stanley.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater portion of the publications of the Medical Faculty\r\ntake the form of monographs, articles, and reports in the various\r\nmonographic series and medical publications--Dr. Vaughan lists 73 such\r\nitems in the years between 1909 and 1918. In the Law School several\r\nbooks on different subjects have been issued by members of the present\r\nFaculty including Professors R.W. Aigler, Evans Holbrook, E.N. Durfee,\r\nE.C. Goddard, and E.R. Sunderland. Particularly to be noted is \"The\r\nHistory of Contract in Early English Equity,\" (1914), by the late\r\nProfessor Willard T. Barbour.\r\n\r\nMost of the books issued by the members of the Engineering Faculty have\r\nbeen primarily textbooks, though many of them have been based upon\r\nextended investigations in the subjects presented. Two volumes by\r\nProfessor Fiske Kimball, formerly of the Department of Architecture,\r\n\"Thomas Jefferson, Architect,\" (1916), and a \"History of Architecture,\"\r\n(1917), are especially noteworthy, however.\r\n\r\nSome of the results of the scientific investigations made by members of\r\nthe Faculties are published in the form of reports issued by the\r\nGovernment or State, or by various scientific bodies. Thus we have\r\nseveral volumes of reports issued by Professor E.C. Case on the results\r\nof his work in the fossil beds of the Southwest, under the auspices of\r\nthe Carnegie Institution; several statistical reports, the work of\r\nProfessor James W. Glover, including \"Highway Bonds,\" U.S. Department of\r\nAgriculture, 1915, and \"U.S. Life Tables,\" (1910) (1916), issued by the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture; a \"Biological Survey of the Sand Dune Region\r\nof Saginaw Bay,\" by Professor Alexander Ruthven, (1910), issued by the\r\nMichigan Geological and Biological Survey, and a number of extended\r\nreports on the valuation of public service corporations, by Dean M.E.\r\nCooley and Professor H.E. Riggs, in the Transactions of the American\r\nSocieties of Civil Engineers, and various other bodies.\r\n\r\nAs has been suggested a great portion of the scientific investigations\r\nof the members of the Faculty of the University is reported in the form\r\nof monographs and briefer articles in various journals and special\r\npublications, and for this reason the names of many men of national and\r\neven international repute do not appear in the lists of those who have\r\npublished books. Many of their publications also have taken the form of\r\ntextbooks, some of them exceedingly important, but the list is so long\r\nthat it would be impossible to do justice to all in a short survey.\r\n\r\nOf the men in the Literary College whose reports and articles are given\r\nin the recent Bibliography a few may properly be mentioned. Thus the\r\nwork of Professor Moses Gomberg, whose researches in the chemistry of\r\ntriphenylmethyl won for him in 1914 the prize from the New York branch\r\nof the American Chemical Society for the most distinguished work of the\r\nyear, has been given to the world since 1909 in the form of relatively\r\nshort papers, some eighteen in all. Professor E.D. Campbell, in addition\r\nto the \"History of the Chemical Laboratory of the University,\" has\r\nreported his investigations, largely in the chemical composition of\r\nsteels, in eighteen papers. Professor William J. Hussey and Professor\r\nRalph H. Curtiss have published respectively fourteen and seventeen\r\npapers, though many of them have been included in the 'publications' of\r\nthe Observatory. Professor Hussey has also made a number of reports in\r\nSpanish of his work in the observatory at the South American University\r\nof La Plata. Other members of the Literary Faculty whose total\r\npublications might be mentioned are Professor E.C. Case, of the\r\nDepartments of Geology and Paleontology, seventeen; Professor A.F.\r\nShull, Zooelogy, twenty-two; Professor William H. Hobbs, Geology,\r\ntwenty-six; Professor A.H. Lloyd, Philosophy, twenty-one; Professor Fred\r\nNewton Scott, Rhetoric, fifteen; and Professor H.H. Bartlett, Botany,\r\nthirty-one.\r\n\r\nAlmost every member of the Medical Faculty has made many contributions\r\nto various medical journals. The University Bibliography includes twelve\r\npapers by Professor A.M. Barrett, eighteen by Professor C.D. Camp,\r\neighteen by Professor D.M. Cowie, fifteen by Professor G. Carl Huber,\r\neighteen by Professor F.G. Novy, twenty-two by Professor Reuben\r\nPeterson, twenty-six by Professor U.J. Wile, and thirty-nine by\r\nProfessor A.S. Warthin.\r\n\r\nIn the Law School Dean Henry M. Bates is represented by eleven papers\r\nand Professor Ralph W. Aigler by twenty-six.\r\n\r\nThe Dental College is represented by nineteen papers by Professor\r\nRussell W. Bunting and eleven by Professor C.J. Lyons, while the\r\nHomeopathic Medical School shows three books and eighteen articles by\r\nProfessor W.A. Dewey.\r\n\r\nDuring the late war the abilities of such members of the Faculty as were\r\nnot in active service and the facilities of the University laboratories\r\nfor research were employed widely by the Government. The Faculty of the\r\nDepartment of Chemical Engineering entered government service almost to\r\na man and an entirely new teaching force had to be secured. Many\r\ntechnical questions, including those connected with poison gas warfare\r\nand the development of the government nitrate plants, whose erection was\r\nunder the charge of Professor A.H. White, as Lieutenant-Colonel in the\r\nArmy, were investigated in the Chemical Laboratories. The Department of\r\nPhysics carried on extended researches in co-operation with the Bureau\r\nof Standards in Washington. Many special problems were investigated in\r\nthe Medical Laboratories, as in the Department of Anatomy, where a study\r\nof the repair of peripheral nerves after severance was instituted by Dr.\r\nG. Carl Huber, first under the National Research Council, later under\r\nthe office of the Surgeon General, which sent several medical officers\r\nto the University for purposes of instruction and to assist him. Dr.\r\nStacey R. Guild, instructor in Anatomy, also made some valuable\r\nexperiments in war deafness. Special investigations were carried on in\r\nthe Bacteriological Laboratories under Dr. Novy, in the Pathological\r\nLaboratory under Dr. Warthin, and in the Psychopathic Hospital, where\r\nDr. Barrett, while training successive increments of medical officers\r\nevery six weeks, carried on special investigations in mental disorders\r\narising from the war.\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected the technical training of the professional staff\r\nof the Engineering College and the resources of the laboratories were\r\nemployed extensively by the Government. This was particularly true of\r\nthe Department of Marine Engineering, where Professor H.C. Sadler\r\nstudied the important problem of standardized types of ships, until he\r\nbecame Head of the Bureau of Design with the Shipping Board, when his\r\nwork in the Naval Tank was carried on by Professor E.M. Bragg.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be claimed of course that this record in scientific inquiry\r\nand advanced scholarship will equal what has been done in certain other\r\nuniversities, whose riper traditions and great endowments have enabled\r\nthem to carry on special investigations, establish research\r\nprofessorships and support publications, which have thus far proved\r\nimpossible for a state institution, whose first obligation rests in its\r\nrelations with the people of the commonwealth. Nevertheless Michigan has\r\nbeen happy in this, as in so many other respects. The liberality and\r\nsympathetic understanding of the public opinion upon which the success\r\nof the University rests fundamentally, have enabled it to develop\r\nscholarly ideals and a recognition of true scholarship which have given\r\nMichigan a high rank among American universities.\r\n\r\nThis fortunate and early recognition of the highest mission of the\r\nUniversity was made possible only through co-operation on the part of\r\nthe Regents, who, as the governing body, have been able on the one side\r\nto encourage scholarly ideals in spite of the occasional lack of\r\nappreciation of the University's aims on the part of some individual\r\nmembers of the Board, and, on the other, to secure and preserve the\r\nUniversity's freedom, threatened by the efforts of the State Legislature\r\nto interfere with its affairs. This relationship of the Regents to the\r\nmaintenance of the University, and to the State, has had a very\r\nimportant effect upon the development of higher learning and research\r\nand may therefore properly be outlined at some length in this place.\r\n\r\nThe University has been truly fortunate for the most part in the men who\r\nhave composed the governing body. There have been times, it is true,\r\nwhen relations between the Regents and the Faculties have been far from\r\nideal, but it is no less true that the history of the past eighty years\r\nwill show a remarkable spirit of co-operation and harmony between the\r\ntwo bodies. Otherwise the University could not have become what it is.\r\nWhile the Regents for the most part have not been men primarily\r\ninterested, or trained, in educational matters, they have taken their\r\nduties seriously and have been unselfish in their service for the\r\ninstitution, with no reward for their labors save the honor inherent in\r\ntheir office. They have sought earnestly to understand the problems\r\nbefore them, and, in whatever measures they took, to keep always before\r\nthem the welfare of the University as a whole. With the ever increasing\r\nnumbers enrolling as students and the consequent well-nigh irresistible\r\npressure for elementary and the so-called \"practical\" courses, they have\r\nbeen strong enough and wise enough, and sufficiently sympathetic with\r\nthe scholarly preoccupations of the leaders of the constantly growing\r\nFaculties, to maintain and encourage the higher aims of the University\r\nas a center of learning. It is true that the Board is sometimes\r\ncriticized for taking upon itself functions which might with propriety\r\nrest with the Faculties and their administrative officers, but there is\r\nat least a legal justification for this in the legislative provisions\r\nupon which the powers of the Board of Regents rest. Thus in the Act of\r\nMarch 18, 1837, the Regents are empowered to \"enact laws for the\r\ngovernment of the University,\" and to appoint the professors and tutors\r\nand fix their salaries. The number of professorships was specified and\r\nfixed at thirteen; though it was provided in the first organization\r\nthat;\r\n\r\n     the Regents shall so arrange the professorships as to appoint such\r\n     a number only as the wants of the institution shall require; and to\r\n     increase them from time to time, as the income from the fund shall\r\n     warrant, and the public interests demand; _Provided, always_, That\r\n     no new professorship shall be established without the consent of\r\n     the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe immediate government of the several departments was to rest with\r\ntheir respective Faculties, but;\r\n\r\n     the Regents shall have power to regulate the course of instruction,\r\n     and prescribe, under the advice of the professorship, the books and\r\n     authorities to be used--and also to confer such degrees and grant\r\n     such diplomas as are usually conferred and granted in other\r\n     universities.\r\n\r\nThe Regents were also to have the power of removing \"any professor or\r\ntutor, or other officer connected with the institution, when in their\r\njudgment the interests of the University shall require it.\" This\r\nspecification of the powers and duties of the Regents was repeated with\r\nsome modifications in the Act of April 8, 1851, which followed the\r\nrevision of the Constitution of 1850. The Constitution itself merely\r\nstated that the Regents \"shall have the general supervision of the\r\nUniversity and the direction and control of all expenditures from the\r\nUniversity interest fund.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the general provisions upon which the relations between the\r\nRegents and the university body are based. In practice the Faculty has\r\ncome to have a greater degree of autonomy in certain directions than\r\nmight be suggested by a strict interpretation of these measures, while\r\nin most cases the \"advice of the professorship\" is sought and followed\r\nreadily and sympathetically in so far as is warranted by the financial\r\nsituation, as it appears to the Board.\r\n\r\nThe University Faculties are organized first by Departments, with one\r\nmember as head; the Schools and Colleges are also organized under the\r\nseparate Deans to carry on their own work, while the general\r\norganization of the whole Faculty rests in the University Senate,\r\ncomposed of all members of professorial rank, including Assistant\r\nProfessors. In addition there is a smaller body, known as the Senate\r\nCouncil, composed of the Deans and one other representative of the\r\ndifferent Schools and Colleges as well as the President, a secretary,\r\nand the chairman of the Committee on Student affairs. To this body are\r\nreferred many questions of importance for immediate action or reference\r\nto the Regents.\r\n\r\nThe independent position of the Board of Regents as the governing body\r\nof the University has not gone unquestioned by the other divisions of\r\nthe state government, and a series of decisions and judicial\r\ninterpretations of the constitutional and legislative acts regarding the\r\nUniversity have been necessary to establish the powers of the Regents as\r\na separate branch of the state administration. Fortunately for the\r\nUniversity these are now well recognized.\r\n\r\nThe first decision arose through the efforts of the Legislature to\r\ncompel the Regents to establish a Professorship of Homeopathy in the\r\nUniversity, and a _mandamus_ action was brought in 1865 to compel the\r\nUniversity to carry out the provisions of a clause to that effect,\r\ninserted in the Organic Act of the University in the years before. This\r\nwas unsuccessful, though not on the ground that the act was\r\nunconstitutional but because one Elijah Drake, who brought the action,\r\nwas not connected with the University and was not, therefore, privileged\r\nto sue for the writ. The question was brought up again in 1867, this\r\ntime by the Regents, who sought to secure the payment of the $15,000\r\ngranted to the University upon condition that they establish a\r\nProfessorship of Homeopathy, by authorizing a School of Homeopathy in\r\nDetroit. Again the Court failed to grant the request. Two years later\r\nthe question came up once more in its first form, in an effort to compel\r\nthe Regents to establish the proposed Department. The Regents argued;\r\n\r\n     If the Legislature could require the appointment of one professor,\r\n     it could require the appointment of another, or any number of\r\n     others. If it could say what professorships should exist, it could\r\n     say what professorships should not exist, and who should fill\r\n     professors' chairs; moreover, if it could regulate the internal\r\n     affairs of the University in this regard, it could do so in others,\r\n     and thus the supervision, direction and control which the\r\n     Constitution vested in the Regents would be at an end.... Either\r\n     the Legislature had no power of the kind, or it had unlimited\r\n     power; either the Regents were the representatives of the people\r\n     who elected them, or they were servants of the Legislature.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: From Hinsdale, _History of the University of Michigan_, p.\r\n143.]\r\n\r\nAgain, however, there was no decision; the constitutional status of the\r\nUniversity was undecided. But in 1892 a decision did establish that the\r\npeople of the State, in incorporating the University, had, by their\r\nConstitution, conferred the entire control and management of its\r\nproperty upon the Regents, and had thereby excluded all departments of\r\nthe state government from any interference with it. The property of the\r\nUniversity was state property it is true, but it could only be\r\nadministered by the Board of Regents as a separate division of the State\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nFinally in 1895 it was definitely decided that the Legislature had no\r\nconstitutional right to interfere in or dictate as to the management of\r\nthe University. The question was once more the Homeopathic issue, which\r\ntook the form of a legislative action to compel the Regents to remove\r\nthe School to Detroit. This time the Regents reversed their earlier\r\npolicy and the measure was stoutly resisted by the Board. Judge\r\nClaudius B. Grant, '59, in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court,\r\nlaid down the principles now accepted as governing the relations of the\r\nUniversity and the Legislature. The Board of Regents, he maintained, was\r\nthe only corporation whose powers were defined in the State\r\nConstitution, whereas in the case of every other corporation established\r\nby the Constitution it was provided that its powers should be defined by\r\nlaw. \"No other conclusion was, in his judgment, possible than that the\r\nintention was to place the institution in the direct and exclusive\r\ncontrol of the people themselves, through a constitutional body elected\r\nby them.\" Otherwise the Regents would become merely \"ministerial\r\nofficers\" with no other duties than to register the will of the\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nThe independent status of the University has also been more firmly\r\nestablished in late years by other legislative enactments and decisions.\r\nAs early as 1863 it was recognized that the Regents had power to hold\r\nand convey real estate, though they had no authority over the land\r\ngranted by Congress for the support of the University, nor over the\r\nprincipal of the fund established through the sale of that land. In 1890\r\nsuch property was declared exempt from taxation, and in 1893 the Board\r\nof Regents was declared to be alone responsible under contracts made by\r\nit for the benefit of the University. In the new Constitution of 1908\r\nthe Regents were given the right of eminent domain, and on a number of\r\noccasions since that time have been able to acquire \"private property\r\nfor the use of the University in the manner prescribed by law.\" It is\r\ndifficult to see how the growth of the University during the past twelve\r\nyears with its constantly expanding building program could have taken\r\nplace without this salutary check upon the exorbitant demands of\r\nproperty owners in the neighborhood of the Campus.\r\n\r\nThis financial autonomy of the Regents, once an appropriation is made by\r\nthe Legislature, has not gone unquestioned, however, particularly by the\r\nAuditor-General. The University fund from early years has been borrowed\r\nby the State which until 1896 paid the original interest rate of seven\r\npercent. The Auditor-General then decided that the legal rate of six\r\npercent should be enforced. The matter was laid before the Supreme\r\nCourt, however, and the old rate was restored. In 1900 it was definitely\r\nruled by the Attorney-General that \"the Auditor-General has no authority\r\nto refuse to audit and pay vouchers for real estate purchased by the\r\nBoard of Regents,\" and subsequently in 1911, the Supreme Court\r\nmaintained that the \"judgment of the Regents as to the legality and\r\nexpediency of expenditures for the use and maintenance of the\r\ninstitution\" could not be considered \"subordinate to that of the\r\nAuditor-General.\"\r\n\r\nThe powers of the Regents have also been strengthened by other rulings\r\nof the Attorney-Generals of the State. Thus in 1900 the power of the\r\nRegents to determine student fees was declared not subject to\r\nlegislative control, while in 1911 the same freedom in the matter of the\r\ndetermination of entrance requirements was conceded. The Board was also\r\ndeclared in 1908 free from the application of an act of the previous\r\nyear providing for the approval and regulation of salaries in the\r\nvarious state institutions.\r\n\r\nThe University has thus been as fortunate in the development of its\r\nrelations with the State as it has been in its internal growth. Though\r\nthere have been many critical times, the movement has always been\r\nforward. The Regents have been careful and conservative in their\r\nrelations with the Legislature, but they have insisted upon the\r\nindependence of the University and have been sustained in this position\r\nwith increasing firmness by the Supreme Court. The Legislature has shown\r\nan ever-increasing friendliness toward the University and has never\r\nrefused to come to the aid of the institution, whatever its views as to\r\nthe constitutional questions involved in the establishment of the\r\nUniversity. This was shown as never before by the 1919 Legislature,\r\nwhich not only granted to the University appropriations amounting to\r\n$2,200,000, but gave it by the unanimous vote of both houses, a thing\r\nwhich had never happened before. The Legislature even included one item\r\nfor which the officers of the University had hardly dared hope to have\r\nfavorable action at that session.\r\n\r\nWith its constitutional status so well established; with the Legislature\r\nso ready to co-operate in furthering the best interests of the\r\nUniversity, with its curriculum continually expanding, though wisely and\r\nnot too rapidly, and with an ever-increasing emphasis on the highest\r\nideals of scholarship and service, there is every promise for a future\r\nof greater usefulness and effective service for the University. We, who\r\nlove the University of Michigan for what it has accomplished, for what\r\nit is, and for what it may become, may well look for a development\r\nthrough the coming years that shall be a fitting continuation of the\r\nremarkable success of the great experiment involved in its\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSTUDENT LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the life of the student in the earliest days of the University\r\nhad a bucolic simplicity almost unimaginable to the undergraduate of\r\nthese days, it was not without its sterner side. The Rev. Theodoric R.\r\nPalmer of the class of '47, who entered the University in 1843, thus\r\nemphasizes the contrast between those times and the present:\r\n\r\n     But twenty-five years had elapsed since the first steamship crossed\r\n     the Atlantic and the first ten miles of passenger railway in the\r\n     United States had been laid but fifteen years. The telegraph was a\r\n     recent invention ... electricity was a plaything, and electrical\r\n     engineering unknown.\r\n\r\nNothing will point this contrast better, perhaps, than the mere fact\r\nthat the Michigan Central, which had only reached Ann Arbor a year or so\r\nbefore, was running one train a day between Detroit and _Dexter_. Most\r\nof the students we may assume, therefore, rode into town on horseback,\r\nas he did, with their gear behind them, or perhaps took advantage of the\r\nseveral stage lines which centered in Ann Arbor.\r\n\r\nThey found a little town charmingly situated in forests and farm\r\nclearings, lying for the most part in the valley of the Huron, though\r\ngradually reaching out toward the University, from which a few houses\r\ncould be seen along the western side of the country road which now is\r\nState Street. The Campus, which for years \"looked like a small farm,\"\r\nwas surrounded by a fence with a turn-stile on the northwest corner.\r\nThis was often broken and was finally replaced by a series of steps,\r\nover which the students passed to their boarding houses in town after\r\ntheir morning recitations and their afternoons of study. In time this\r\nstile gave way to posts with room enough between for a man, \"but not for\r\na cow.\" Early hours were imperative, for kerosene or \"coal-oil\" was\r\npractically unknown in the forties, and candles and whale oil were the\r\nsole source of illumination, while the wood yard, always mentioned with\r\ndeep feeling by every alumnus of that period, was the source of heat.\r\n\r\nTime went according to a bell mounted on a post at the rear, which\r\nseemed to have been a prolific source of student humor. It was turned\r\nupside down in winter and filled with water, with a corresponding\r\nvacation the following morning; the clapper was stolen; and finally in\r\nDr. Tappan's day it was even carried away, post and all. The President,\r\nhowever, was a match for the jokers and simply announced that as the\r\nbell was a convenience which the students did not seem to need, classes\r\nwould be held henceforth without the usual call. As the regulations were\r\nvery strict as to attendance and four unexcused absences a matter for\r\nthe higher powers, it was not long before a student rose in Chapel and\r\nrequested permission to reinstate the Campus time-piece,--which was\r\ngraciously granted.\r\n\r\nThere are stories innumerable of donkeys and geese appearing in unusual\r\nplaces and of the Chapel on one occasion being filled with hay, while\r\nonce a whole load of wood, wagon and all, was laboriously set up on the\r\nroof of the college hall. On another occasion a number of students,\r\nwaiting for their recitation period, corralled a herd of cows grazing on\r\nthe Campus, and so thoroughly frightened one calf that he rushed into\r\nthe open door of the building as the safest refuge. Some one shut the\r\ndoor instantly, and when Professor Winchell's class-room door was\r\nopened, in rushed the badly demoralized animal. The effect may be\r\nimagined. Professor Winchell always thought it a \"proposed and\r\ndeliberate insult,\" but, as the historian of the incident in the\r\n\"Class-Book\" of '61 observes: \"Any one will at once perceive that no one\r\nwas to blame but the calf, who lost his presence of mind.\" All this\r\nhumor, however, was rather elementary; for the most part life was\r\nsufficiently sedate, and the pranks ordinarily far from atrocious.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest days the term fees of $7.50 covered the cost of rooms in\r\nthe dormitories, while the cost of board ranged from $1.50 to $2.00 a\r\nweek. H.B. Nichols, a student in 1850, gave his father the following,--\r\n\r\n     account of monies, by me expended. In it I put an estimate of the\r\n     term tax at $6.00. It is $6.62-1/2 and divided as follows, viz:\r\n     Room rent, $1.50. Janitor's fees, $1.50. Wood bill $2.87-1/2 and\r\n     Hall tax for damages to the Buildings, viz. Brokens doors and\r\n     windows, $.75, making in all the sum of $6.62-1/2. Last term $4.60.\r\n     So you see it is all a humbug for the catalogue to say the charges\r\n     will range from $5.00 to $7.50 per year, as it will not be less\r\n     than $15.00 to each student, or $30.00 to each room and if a\r\n     student rooms alone his charges will be $21.00 per year!\r\n\r\nAs for his boarding place:\r\n\r\n     I changed or rather left Mrs. Andrews and went ... to Professor Ten\r\n     Brook's. I like it so well at the Prof's that I have remained there\r\n     since. Lest you should be unwilling, or perhaps fearful for my\r\n     health, I would say that the Prof. has kindly offered me his horse\r\n     to use every morning or as much as I please. A ride on horseback is\r\n     exceeding good exercise. Especially when a horse is as hard to\r\n     ride as the Prof's is wont to be. Do you recollect a sorrel steed\r\n     you sold to Mr. Dan Stowell? Prof's horse's movements are just\r\n     about as _convenient_ as that one's were. My objection to boarding\r\n     at a public boarding house, is, that no regard is paid to the rules\r\n     of politeness and _good_ manners. Every one for himself, is the\r\n     motto. Not so in a private family. Mrs. Ten Brook is a very\r\n     accomplished lady and the Prof. is not much behind her in that\r\n     respect. They set a _good_ table, not a very _rich_ one, but rather\r\n     a plain one. In the morning, Buckwheat pancakes and maple molasses,\r\n     besides potatoes and sausage. At noon, 'steak,' sometimes fish. The\r\n     professor charges 12 shillings for board. I like _him_ of all the\r\n     Prof's, the best.\r\n\r\nWhat would a student nowadays think of a menu like that for $1.50 a\r\nweek?\r\n\r\nThe first boarding club was established in 1860 in the house, not far\r\nfrom the ancient \"Cat-Hole,\" of one Mrs. O'Toole, \"a pretty good\r\nall-round cook, whose forte was apple dumplings\" served daily. The\r\nsteward was Charles Kendall Adams, '61, while other members were Walter\r\nW. Perry and Byron M. Cutcheon of the class of 1861 and Martin L. D'Ooge\r\nof the class of 1862.\r\n\r\nRecreation was not a part of the earlier curriculum and athletics were\r\nunknown under that name, though feats of strength, jumping, lifting\r\ndumb-bells, the heavier the better, and foot-races, were common. Perhaps\r\nthat woodyard and the favorite games of one-old-cat and wicket, a\r\nmodification of cricket, were sufficient substitutes, occasionally\r\nvaried by a fishing trip on the Huron or a walk to Ypsilanti, whenever\r\nthe necessary permission from the authorities to leave Ann Arbor was\r\nforthcoming. Social opportunities came largely through the relations of\r\nthe students with the townspeople and their lovely daughters,\r\nparticularly at the popular church socials. Many of the brightest and\r\nmost beautiful local belles came from \"lower town,\" or north Ann Arbor,\r\na most important section at that time,--some even lived nearly a mile\r\nbeyond the old long bridge at the foot of Broadway hill. To them the new\r\nstudents were invariably introduced; the wise ones surrendering all\r\nrights, so that when the social was over, it was only natural for the\r\nnew men to ask for the privilege of escorting them home; something of an\r\nordeal on a winter night. The old wooden viaduct over the tracks was\r\nknown in those days as the \"Bridge of Sighs.\"\r\n\r\nOf conviviality there was comparatively little in the earliest days,\r\nthough occasionally some students succumbed to the beer and wine of the\r\nGerman townspeople. A certain drinking bout in 1858, however, had most\r\nserious consequences; one student died as the result, and this, with the\r\nresultant expulsions, seems to have had a very restraining influence for\r\nsome years. Societies or other groups often went down to a Mrs. Slack's\r\nrestaurant, where they were served by a pretty waitress named\r\n\"Rika\"--whose only claim to fame lies in the reminiscence of those\r\nundergraduates of '49 who were her patrons. But for the most part the\r\nlife of the University was lived in a sane and wholesome atmosphere. The\r\nstudents were almost all from farm homes; they were used to the simple\r\nlife and were in earnest in their efforts for an education. They were\r\nwatched with a paternal eye by the Faculty and duly admonished at the\r\ntwo daily chapel exercises, long a part of University life. Their hours\r\nwere carefully provided for; their courses were compulsory; and their\r\nattendance at classes insured by numbers on the class-room benches which\r\nhad to be duly covered. For this, the shawls that the students wore in\r\nthe late fifties seem to have been popular--several students, plus\r\nshawls, were able to conceal many gaps if the monitor were not too\r\nobservant.\r\n\r\nThroughout the earlier years there was a great emphasis on public\r\nspeaking, for which ample opportunity was given in various \"class\r\nexhibitions.\" These were inaugurated by the sophomores in 1843 with a\r\nprogramme of four orations, four dissertations, four essays, and one\r\npoem. The same class continued the precedent the next year, followed by\r\nsucceeding junior classes, so that these exhibitions became an\r\ninstitution, long supported not alone by the students but by Faculty and\r\ninterested citizens as well. The end did not come until 1871 when the\r\nlast junior exhibition was held. The first class-day was held by '62 in\r\nthe spring of their junior year, but it was celebrated informally and\r\nnot taken very seriously until 1865 when the first real exercises took\r\nplace in May at the beginning of the \"Senior Vacation.\" The place was\r\nthe old Presbyterian church, which seems to have been the favorite\r\nauditorium. The \"presentation\" of the class was made in Greek by\r\nProfessor Boise, while President Haven replied in Latin. In one at least\r\nof these first class-day programmes the oration and poem only were\r\npublic, while the history and prophecy were submitted to the class at a\r\nconvivial session at the popular Hangsterfer's.\r\n\r\nThe place which these early platform efforts took in the life of those\r\ndays is shown by two incidents. The first is related by Gen. W.H.H.\r\nBeadle, '61, later President of the University of South Dakota, who\r\ntells how an address by \"one student\" in 1858, denouncing the iniquity\r\nof the Mexican War as begun and waged for the extension of slavery,\r\ncalled him to the attention of the abolitionists, one of whom asked him\r\nif he would care to take a \"long ride on a good horse.\" He would of\r\ncourse, and did, carrying a message to a Quaker farmer in Lenawee\r\nCounty, whose home was a station of the underground railway. Andrew D.\r\nWhite also describes with reminiscent pleasure how he groomed one of his\r\nstudents to defeat a local politician, known as \"Old Statistics,\" who\r\nwas characterized by his senatorial aspirations and his carefully\r\nappropriate garb, tall hat, blue swallow-tail and buff waistcoat with\r\nbrass buttons. The wrath of this worthy, as a disciple of Henry Clay,\r\nhad been aroused by the teachings of Professor White, who at that time\r\nwas opposed to a protective tariff, and a public debate was to clinch\r\nthe discussion. The result was a complete victory for the young David,\r\nwho had the audience with him from the first, to the immense chagrin of\r\nhis pompous opponent.\r\n\r\nThe annual Commencement exercises were usually held in one of the local\r\nchurches and sometimes, after 1856, in the hall of the Union School\r\nbuilding, though nowhere was there an auditorium large enough to hold\r\nall who wished to attend,--a situation not changed, in fact, until the\r\nerection of Hill Auditorium in 1913. Upon one occasion women were\r\nadmitted an hour earlier than men, a bit of partiality which drew a\r\nprotest against such injustice and a reference to the perfectly good\r\nspace wasted through the necessities of the prevailing crinolines. One\r\nclass, at least, that of '46, held its exercises in a great revival\r\ntent, especially imported from Chicago and set up after a week's\r\nstrenuous exertion on the part of the students. The programme consisted\r\nof short orations by the graduates, who were democratically placed on\r\nthe programme with no reference to standings. The increasing size of the\r\nclasses led eventually to a Faculty selection of certain speakers to\r\nrepresent the students. In 1878 class participation was abolished and\r\nthe practice of inviting distinguished men to give the Commencement\r\naddress was inaugurated. The old practice of giving the seniors a\r\nvacation period in which to prepare their speeches also came to an end\r\nwith this change.\r\n\r\nThe traditional rivalry between classes in the University existed from\r\nthe first and many were the lessons taught the upstanding freshmen, with\r\nnatural retaliations on the sophomores. To this was added a natural\r\ninter-departmental rivalry which came with the establishment of the\r\nprofessional schools. The \"medics\" and the \"laws,\" however, soon grew\r\nstrong enough to take care of themselves and were in fact for many years\r\nlargely in the majority. And with this growth of class and departmental\r\nspirit, which increasing numbers brought, the rushing and hazing\r\nepisodes in the seventies and eighties became more serious--not so much\r\nbecause of their dangerous character in themselves, as for the\r\nopportunity they gave to unfriendly critics of the institution. The\r\nusual student, however, yields to no one in his love for his alma mater\r\nand time and again it has only been necessary to point out the real\r\ndanger to the University arising from such practices to bring about\r\ntheir abandonment,--until the next crop of hazers has to go through the\r\nsame process of education.\r\n\r\nThis inter-departmental rivalry, which was most intense about 1900,\r\nnaturally led to many escapades. One picturesque incident resulted when\r\n1900 ran a flag bearing the class numerals to the top of the University\r\nflag-pole, and left it to sweep the skies with the halyards cut. A\r\nWestern sharpshooter was enlisted from the ranks of the Law Department\r\nand the offending emblem was brought down on the second shot, to the\r\ngreat satisfaction of the \"laws.\" Less excusable was the method the\r\nclass of 1902 took to immortalize its victory over the \"laws\" by\r\npainting the class numerals prominently on the soft sand-stone of the\r\nLaw Building, of which traces remain to this day for those who know\r\nwhere to look. The guilty class was made to feel mightily ashamed of\r\nitself for a while, but in after years it has proudly borne the title of\r\n\"Human Skunks\" conferred upon it at the time.\r\n\r\nMass action has always been a favorite method of student expression. Of\r\nthis the organized \"bolting\" of the years just after the war is an\r\nexample. This went on to such a degree that it became necessary for the\r\nFaculty to pass a resolution stating that \"in the absence of an\r\ninstructor, his class shall be expected to remain until at least five\r\nminutes after the ringing of the bell.\" Apparently this did not stop the\r\npractice, and suspension or dismissal were threatened in 1867. This rule\r\nwas drastically applied in 1871 when a large number of freshmen and\r\nsophomores, who had found Van Amburgh's circus more attractive than\r\ntheir classes, were actually suspended. It is not difficult to trace in\r\nthis affair the origin of the song popular to this day, though its\r\napplication has been long forgotten:\r\n\r\n    We are going to the Hamburg show\r\n    To see the elephant and the wild kangaroo;--\r\n    And we'll all stick together, through rain or stormy weather,\r\n    For we're going to see the whole show through.\r\n\r\nThis ended that epidemic and bolting henceforth became individual and\r\nnot collective.\r\n\r\nThe burning of \"mechanics\" was also a popular rite, which in its earlier\r\ndays celebrated the completion of the course in physics under Professor\r\nWilliams. This time-honored ceremony took the form of a procession of\r\nsolemn officials which escorted the \"corpus,\" borne on an elaborate\r\nbier, to a place of judgment, where it was condemned most impressively\r\nand executed with elaborate rites. The \"corpus\" was well guarded,--on\r\none occasion at least by eight juniors armed with bayonets,--from the\r\nsophomores, who were infuriated by the fact that the head of the\r\nintended victim, a skull furnished from medical sources, was crowned by\r\na mortar-board, the sophomore class insignia. A formal trial followed,\r\npresided over by a Pontifex Maximus, in which a Judex, an Advocatus Pro,\r\nand an Advocatus Con participated, with the foregone result that the\r\nculprit was sentenced to be hanged, shot, and burned; a decree carried\r\nout on a gallows and bonfire previously prepared in spite of the\r\nsophomores' best efforts.\r\n\r\nThis annual fracas assumed a particularly lurid character in 1860 and\r\nthe printed program was especially objectionable, a fault quite\r\ncharacteristic of those days. The night had been a wild one and when it\r\nbecame known that Dr. Tappan was to discuss the matter the next morning\r\nin Chapel, there were many misgivings. To every one's surprise, however,\r\n\"there was no touch of reprimand in voice or word. In a sympathetic and\r\nfamiliar way, he began to talk about college songs.\" He told how he had\r\nonce been greeted, upon opening his mail in Sweden, by a copy of the\r\nsong \"Where, Oh Where, is Doctor Tappan?\" an evidence of student\r\ninterest in his whereabouts which had cheered and inspired him mightily.\r\nThen, as merely incidental, and by way of contrast, he referred in mild\r\ntones to the obnoxious print of the night before,--\"no moralizing but a\r\nsalutary and effective talk, which was greeted by hearty cheers.\"\r\n\r\nThus far we have been considering the student life of a University\r\nwhich, judged by modern standards, was small and comparatively\r\nhomogeneous. The student of those days knew every one in college. The\r\nprofessors were able to take a personal interest in all their pupils;\r\neven the President made it a point to know every one by name. All this\r\nhas been changed within the last twenty-five years. Where in 1885 the\r\nstudent enrolment was only about 1,300, it increased to 2,200 in 1890\r\nand to 2,800 in 1895, and this rate of growth has continued almost\r\nunbroken up to the present time. The result is that now there are nearly\r\n9,000 students on the Campus during the college year, and with the\r\nextraordinary increase which has followed the late war, there is every\r\nprospect of this growth continuing.\r\n\r\nIn itself this is good evidence of the University's success as a center\r\nof education; but these increasing throngs of students bring many\r\ndifficult problems, not the least of which is the necessity of finding\r\nan adequate supply of teachers, class rooms, and laboratories. Equally,\r\nlife in the University becomes more complicated. The ideal simplicity of\r\nacademic life, the intimate contact between fellow-students and between\r\nstudents and Faculties, is all too easily lost in the leveling\r\ntendencies which numbers make inevitable. This is the great danger of\r\nthe large University--but a peril that has been recognized and has been\r\nmet with at least some degree of success.\r\n\r\nThe student organizations, fraternities, and clubs, which have\r\nmultiplied to so remarkable a degree, are perhaps the first and most\r\nimportant student reaction. Many if not most of these organizations have\r\nsome connection with individual Faculty members, either through alumni\r\non the Faculty or through honorary members, and this forms a basis at\r\nleast for some extra class-room relationship. Sometimes, on occasion, a\r\ncertain restraint on the part of the Faculty becomes inevitable, and the\r\nestablishment of a Committee on Student Affairs, originally a committee\r\non \"non-athletic\" relations, created some fifteen years ago, has\r\nresulted. This committee has accomplished much towards directing student\r\nactivities into proper and worthwhile channels, though the ghost of the\r\nclassic charge of unwelcome paternalism arises occasionally. The only\r\nanswer necessary is the evident improvement in the general standards of\r\nall student organizations and the mere fact that they have, for the most\r\npart, continued to exist through several student generations; no little\r\naccomplishment in itself, when one remembers the almost automatic rise\r\nand fall of these societies in the early days.\r\n\r\nIf the University and particularly the Faculty has been concerned with\r\nthese problems, incident upon the University's growth, so have the\r\nstudents themselves. They have seen the necessity for constructive\r\neffort and have established such agencies as the Student Council and the\r\nInter-fraternity Council among the men, and the corresponding Judiciary\r\nCouncil and Pan-Hellenic Association among the women. Above all, the\r\nUniversity has profited by the two great organizations which have been\r\nthe most effective expression of student life and ideals,--the Michigan\r\nUnion and the Women's League.\r\n\r\nWhile the fundamental control of the student body rests, as it always\r\nhas, with the Faculty, the students have almost always shown themselves\r\nready and able to deal with questions of a certain type more promptly\r\nand effectively than the Faculty. This is evident by the good record of\r\nthe Student Council since its organization in 1905. The members of this\r\nbody are elected during the last half of their Junior or the beginning\r\nof their Senior year, and are usually the strongest men in their\r\nclasses, though not necessarily the most popular or the best students.\r\nMost of the Council's work has had to do with student customs, the\r\nregulation of old, and the establishment of new, \"traditions,\" a\r\nparadoxical procedure perhaps, but a source of much that is picturesque.\r\nOf these traditions, none has been more acceptable than the custom of\r\nrequiring freshmen to wear the little gray caps, or knitted toques in\r\nthe winter, with a button at the top, signifying by its color the\r\nCollege or School of the wearer. No more inspiring or beautiful ceremony\r\noccurs in university life than the annual \"cap-night\" celebration when\r\nthe student body meets in \"Sleepy Hollow\" near the Observatory, about a\r\ngreat bonfire, to watch the burning of the caps, and the formal\r\ninitiation of the freshmen into the responsibilities of college life.\r\nThe dance of the freshmen about the fire and the showers of caps falling\r\ninto the flames (they have been sent to the Belgians the last few\r\nyears), combined with the vigor and idealism of the speeches which\r\nfollow, all conspire to produce one of the most stirring and impressive\r\nevents of the year.\r\n\r\nOf more fundamental importance has been the Council's regulation of the\r\nirrepressible freshmen-sophomore rivalry, which long took the course of\r\nmedieval hair-cutting forays, sometimes, as in 1904, carried on even\r\nwithin the sacred precincts of the Library. The reform came through the\r\nestablishment in 1908 of a series of inter-class contests. Particularly\r\npicturesque are those held in May, which include a tug-of-war across the\r\nHuron River, a series of obstacle relay races, and a massed battle about\r\na six-foot push ball on Ferry Field as the finale. While not entirely\r\ninnocuous, these games form an apparently necessary and acceptable\r\nsafety valve for the exuberances of class spirit. The upper-classman is\r\nmost sensitive to the good name of the University; to him the dangers of\r\nundue newspaper notoriety are quite apparent, and thus through the\r\nCouncil the students themselves have been able on the whole to control\r\nsuccessfully what is always a difficult and delicate question for\r\nuniversity officers. Hardly less important among the Council's functions\r\nis the management of various undergraduate occasions, mass-meetings,\r\ncampus elections, and inter-class athletics, demonstrations where\r\ntrouble might brew without the guidance of wiser heads. More than once\r\nwhen a mass of under-classmen has seemed on the verge of a dangerous\r\nexplosion, the members of the Council have intervened quietly and\r\neffectively. Ordinarily, this modesty has been characteristic of the\r\nCouncil's work. A similar regulation of the affairs of the women is\r\nexercised by a Judiciary Council organized at the suggestion of the\r\nUniversity Senate in 1913.\r\n\r\nOf all student organizations, however, the Michigan Union has\r\naccomplished the most toward promoting the best interests of the student\r\nbody since its establishment as a general organization in 1904. To those\r\nwho are only familiar with the Union of later years, the name will\r\nalmost inevitably suggest the building rather than the organization. The\r\nnew club house, practically completed in the first months of 1920, is\r\nnaturally the obvious embodiment of the Union which strikes the observer\r\nupon first acquaintance. It cannot be emphasized too strongly, however,\r\nthat the building is, after all, but the home of an organization. This\r\nis the essential fact which has never been forgotten by the officers of\r\nthe Union. Their efforts from the first have been to make it, both as an\r\norganization and as a building, of practical service for Michigan's\r\nimmense student body, which without the resources of a large city, needs\r\npeculiarly such headquarters for all its wide and varied interests.\r\nPerhaps the most concise definition of the Union is contained in the\r\npreamble of its present Constitution:\r\n\r\n     To establish a University social and recreational center; to\r\n     provide a meeting place for Faculty, alumni, former students and\r\n     resident students of the University; and to help in fitting\r\n     Michigan men for the performance of their duties as good citizens.\r\n\r\nIt is the Union as a _body of students_, using the building as a means\r\nto promote the best things in college life, to bring about a closer\r\nco-ordination of all university activities, and a more sympathetic\r\nco-operation between the undergraduates, Faculty, and alumni, that must\r\njustify the money and energy spent in this great departure in American\r\ncollege life,--for there is nothing in any American university today\r\nthat approaches the Union in size or the scale upon which its activities\r\nare planned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MICHIGAN UNION]\r\n\r\nThe need of such a building had long been felt by the students before\r\nthe first discussion on the part of the members of the senior society,\r\nMichigamua, led to a call which brought representatives of all the\r\nleading organizations in the University together in the spring of 1904.\r\nThe idea proved popular at once, though it was again the organization,\r\nand not the somewhat remote prospect of a building, that won support.\r\nFrom the first the Union aimed to be an expression of student life as a\r\nwhole and almost immediately, side by side with an active campaign for a\r\nbuilding, it undertook to correlate and to unify the interests of the\r\nstudents in the different departments, classes, and organizations. The\r\nalumni, too, were knit into a body which aimed consistently to recognize\r\nthe claim of the University to the regard and loyal support of every\r\nMichigan man. The Student Council was established at the inspiration of\r\nthe Union soon after its organization. Some years later a similar\r\nmovement inspired by the Union resulted in the establishment of the\r\nUniversity Health Service through a series of recommendations made by a\r\ncommittee of Union members to the Board of Regents. Mass meetings and\r\nsmokers were held and a great annual dinner was initiated the first\r\nyear, at which the ideals of the University and the aims of the Union\r\nwere discussed. Funds were raised for the portrait of President Angell\r\nby William M. Chase. Musical shows and carnivals were held, not merely\r\nto raise money for the Union, but to bring the student body together in\r\none absorbing interest. In December, 1906, Judge Cooley's old home on\r\nState Street was purchased, to be used temporarily as the Union Club\r\nHouse and eventually to be replaced by the present building. The house\r\nwas altered extensively,--two dining-rooms were installed, together with\r\nother features of a club, and for nine years it served the University\r\nwell, though its facilities became increasingly inadequate as the mass\r\nof students grew.\r\n\r\nNot for one minute, however, was the need for a greater building\r\nforgotten, and through mass meetings, alumni dinners, and University\r\npublications, the alumni were educated as to the aims and ideals of the\r\norganization and the vital need of a building which should adequately\r\nserve as the center of the life of the thousands of men in the\r\nUniversity. All this was not accomplished without opposition, which\r\ncentered largely in the rival claims of the committee charged with the\r\nraising of funds for Alumni Memorial Hall. Fortunately this\r\nmisunderstanding faded away when the Memorial Building was completed in\r\n1909 and the purpose of the Union became better understood.\r\n\r\nThis long effort among the alumni eventually began to have its effect\r\nand for several years before the actual campaign for funds for the Union\r\nwas launched, alumni everywhere were asking: \"When are you going to ask\r\nus to contribute toward the new Union? I want to do something.\" Yet the\r\nactual result of the campaign, when it was finally launched in 1915, was\r\nin many ways a great surprise. Within a little over a year some $800,000\r\nwas subscribed and work on the new building was begun. The most\r\nremarkable aspect of this response was the fact that no large\r\nsubscriptions were made,--$10,000 was the largest. In fact the majority\r\nof the subscriptions came in the form of $50 life memberships which not\r\nonly made the graduates of the University participants in an institution\r\nconcerned with the fundamentals of University life, linking students,\r\nteachers, and alumni in a common cause, but gave the graduates a home in\r\nAnn Arbor to which they could return as of right, asking no favors. It\r\nis doubtful if any large undertaking in any university has ever been\r\nmore widely supported by general alumni subscriptions.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of war in 1917, and the almost immediate increase in\r\nbuilding costs, made more difficult the completion of the building,\r\nthough a supplementary campaign in 1919 increased the funds to over the\r\nmillion dollars originally asked for. Even this proved inadequate and\r\nwhen the Union was finally opened in the fall of 1919, there was still\r\nsome $200,000 to be raised, secured by a mortgage on the building.\r\nThis, in effect, represented the increase in the cost of building during\r\nthe war. The completion of the Union was felt to be a vital matter and\r\nwhile the wide-spread interest of the alumni in the building made it\r\npractically certain that the necessary funds would be forthcoming within\r\na few years; to delay until the full amount was in hand would have been\r\ndisastrous. During the abnormal years of 1918-19, $60,000 alone was\r\nadded to the building fund through student life memberships, while the\r\nfollowing fall over $110,000 more was pledged this way, a practical\r\nevidence of undergraduate interest and support.\r\n\r\nThe Union is peculiarly a Michigan product. It stands not only on the\r\nsite of Judge Cooley's old home but also on that of the boyhood home of\r\nthe architects, Irving K. Pond, '79, President of the American Institute\r\nof Architects in 1910 and 1911, and his brother Allen B. Pond, '80.\r\nStrong and masculine in all its lines, the building throughout is a\r\nconsistent interpretation of the artistic faith of the architects, who\r\nhave been bold enough to break with overworn conventions in the design\r\nand have made it peculiarly an expression, in its whole conception as\r\nwell as in its finest details, of a distinctly American spirit. A\r\nsuggestion of the English collegiate Gothic style in its larger forms\r\nwas deliberately chosen as typifying the fundamental source of our\r\ninstitutions; but in the general treatment, particularly in the simple,\r\nmodern, truly American masses and details, which are everywhere full of\r\na refined and delicate symbolism, the building is an interpretation of\r\nthe underlying spirit of American Democracy. That the architects have\r\nbeen successful no one can deny who has seen the Union and has felt the\r\nrugged beauty of its central tower, which became at once the striking\r\nfeature of Ann Arbor's skyline.\r\n\r\nThe building is necessarily large; it is 168 feet in all across the\r\nfront and 233 feet deep, with four stories, a basement, and\r\nsub-basement. In addition to other usual facilities of a large club, it\r\ncontains a swimming pool (not completed in 1920), a bowling alley, an\r\nimmensely popular cafeteria for men, known as the Tap-Room, a woman's\r\ndining-room with a separate entrance, a billiard room, with twenty-five\r\ntables, a large banquet and assembly hall, 58 by 104 feet, for dinners,\r\ndances, and large gatherings, besides innumerable smaller rooms which\r\ncan be used either for dinners or for class and society meetings. There\r\nare in fact dining-room accommodations for over 1,200 guests at one\r\ntime. Offices and various headquarters for campus organizations are also\r\nincluded as well as one feature particularly welcome to alumni, some 48\r\nsleeping rooms accommodating 69 visitors.\r\n\r\nThus the Union has realized its ideals. While the success of the Union\r\nis due to the continued and self-sacrificing efforts of hundreds of\r\nMichigan men, students and alumni alike, special recognition will always\r\nbe due Dean Henry M. Bates, '90, of the Law School, whose strong support\r\nand practical idealism as a member of the Board of Directors from the\r\nvery earliest days carried the project through many dark periods, as\r\nwell as to the energy and enthusiasm of Homer Heath, '07, manager of the\r\nUnion Building from the first, to whom is due in no small degree the\r\nsuccessful outcome of the campaign for the building, and its final\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\nThe control of the Union is vested in two organizations; a Board of\r\nDirectors composed of students, Faculty representatives, and alumni,\r\nwhich has in general the supervision of the activities of the Union as\r\nan organization, and a Board of Governors, created upon completion of\r\nthe building, composed of the student President of the Union, one member\r\nof the Board of Regents, the Financial Secretary appointed by the\r\nPresident of the University and four members appointed by the Board of\r\nDirectors of the Alumni Association, to have financial control of the\r\nbuilding and organization as a corporation.\r\n\r\nWith the opening of the University in 1919, when the enrolment exceeded\r\nby 1,500 the previous record attendance in 1916, the Union entered upon\r\na new and more effective period of service, not entirely equipped and\r\nready, it is true, but sufficiently prepared to justify at once the\r\nvision of those responsible for the result. Even without any endowment\r\nit demonstrated from the first that it could be maintained as an\r\nessentially self-supporting concern.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A careful estimate, made in October, 1920, showed that an\r\naverage of 7,500 persons daily passed the doors of the Union. Some 2,200\r\npersons were also served daily in the Tap-Room or cafeteria, in addition\r\nto the regular dining-room service.]\r\n\r\nAs the Union served the life of the men in the University, other\r\nagencies have come to do the same for the women. Long before the Union\r\nwas even thought of, the Women's League maintained headquarters in the\r\nparlors of Barbour Gymnasium, which, with Sarah Caswell Angell Hall and\r\nthe adjoining gymnasium, served the women well. These, with the three\r\nrecently constructed halls of residence, including the Martha Cook\r\nBuilding, perhaps the most beautiful and luxurious dormitory ever built\r\nin an American university, will go far towards answering the social\r\nneeds of the women. They have at least made the general scale of living\r\nconditions far more favorable for the girls of the University than for\r\nthe men, who for many years have been sadly in need of the facilities\r\noffered by such a building as the Union. Fortunately there is every\r\nprospect that some dormitories for men will be forthcoming in the near\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe religious life of the students has never been neglected, though the\r\ncareful non-sectarianism of the University led it at first to be\r\nregarded with suspicion by the various religious bodies of the State,\r\nand their opposition, sometimes veiled, and sometimes open, proved\r\nembarrassing. It has been shown how this sentiment was met by a\r\nprevailing clerical complexion in the Faculty and an emphasis on daily\r\nchapel exercises which were maintained long after the practice of\r\nconsidering religious affiliations as one of the prime professorial\r\nrequisites was abandoned. This emphasis on the proper observance of the\r\nSabbath is rather amusingly illustrated in the regular practice in those\r\ndays of having the Monday Greek lesson consist of a chapter of the Greek\r\nTestament; it being no sin to study the scriptures on Sunday. From which\r\nwe might gather that in some essentials, such as Sunday study, the\r\nstudent of 1850 was true grandfather of the undergraduate of today.\r\nEvery effort was made to make college regulations a substitute for home\r\ninfluences, and the members of that first Faculty were all remembered\r\nfor their kindly and paternal relations with the students. It was\r\nlargely because of the personal qualities and wisdom of these men that\r\nthe institution was able to steer successfully between the dangers of\r\nreligious indifference and sectarianism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DOORWAY OF THE MARTHA COOK BUILDING]\r\n\r\nThe changes from those stricter days have come gradually and as a\r\nreflection of the spirit of the age; the scientific and not the\r\necclesiastical spirit rules, with the result that the student is left\r\nmore to his own devices in ordering his life. The discipline of the old\r\ndays would not be tolerated now and any tendency towards firmer\r\nregulation of undergraduate life is often resented. The break came\r\nfirst, perhaps, in a new spirit of independence which followed the\r\nfraternity crisis in 1850. This was emphasized by the fact that the\r\nstudents in the professional schools were excused from compulsory church\r\nand chapel attendance, a discrimination which did not fail to react upon\r\nthe literary undergraduates. The rule still held, however, until 1871;\r\nthough the Sunday monitor who checked church attendance had long\r\ndisappeared. Daily prayers were maintained until 1895 when they were\r\nsucceeded by semi-weekly vesper services, which, in turn, were\r\neventually discontinued. Current opinion upon this gradual change is\r\npossibly reflected in the statement made in 1900 by President Angell:\r\n\r\n     Where, as at the University of Michigan, the average age of the\r\n     freshman on entering college is 19.5, it is at least open to\r\n     discussion whether the spiritual welfare of undergraduates will be\r\n     promoted by their being driven to religious services under fear of\r\n     the monitor's mark.\r\n\r\nA religious census made in 1894 showed that of approximately 3,000\r\nstudents, 2,500 were church members or church adherents, and that 301\r\nstudents had become clergymen or missionaries. A similar census of the\r\nmen in 1919 showed that of a total of 5,804, 3,501 were church members,\r\nwhile 943 others expressed some church preference. This included all\r\nforms of belief. These statistics seem to indicate that there has been\r\nvery little change in this respect in the last twenty-five years, though\r\nsome decrease in church attendance would not be surprising in view of\r\nthe great increase in students and the less homogeneous character of the\r\nstudent body. No one familiar with the student life today, however, will\r\nquestion the vitality and effectiveness of the religious influences\r\nwhich reach the students through the various churches and religious\r\norganizations of Ann Arbor, particularly in view of extensive plans now\r\nunder way for further co-operation on the part of the churches.\r\n\r\nThe passing of the old Chapel in the religious life of the University\r\nwas marked by the growing strength of religious bodies among the\r\nstudents. The strong religious spirit of the early Faculty was reflected\r\nby their encouragement of an organization known as the Union Missionary\r\nSociety of Inquiry, which followed the great missionary movement of the\r\nfirst part of the century, and served as a rallying point for\r\nundergraduate religious life. This organization, however, according to\r\nProfessor Hinsdale, was \"anything but an unmixed blessing, either to the\r\ninstitution or to the students,\" though in what particular is not\r\ndisclosed. There also existed from earliest days, a Sunday morning\r\nservice which the students conducted in the Chapel. The old Missionary\r\nSociety came to an end in 1857, to be followed by the Students'\r\nChristian Association, which soon became one of the most effective\r\nfactors in university religious life. It was the first association of\r\nthis character organized in any American college, and through what may\r\nbe regarded as a fortunate accident in its name the opportunity for\r\nmembership was left open to women students upon their admission twelve\r\nyears later. This brought to it a powerful reinforcement.\r\n\r\nThe Association professed no creed, the members merely pledging\r\nthemselves to religious character and work. The meetings were held at\r\nfirst on the fourth floor of the old South College, but this proved\r\ninadequate and with the coming of President Haven, the Association was\r\nestablished in a room especially fitted up for it on the first floor.\r\nEventually these quarters in turn became too small, for, at the time of\r\nthe semi-centennial celebration of 1887, when the need for a new home\r\nfor the Association was discussed, the membership of 300 was far too\r\nlarge for this room. A movement for a new building arose, therefore,\r\nwhich led to a successful appeal to the alumni; though it was not until\r\nJune, 1891, that the Students' Christian Association Building which\r\nstands on State Street almost directly across from University Hall was\r\nformally dedicated. The total cost was about $40,000 and of this amount\r\nMrs. Helen H. Newberry of Detroit gave about $18,000; the building being\r\nknown as Newberry Hall in honor of her husband, John S. Newberry, of the\r\nclass of '47.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the work of the Students' Christian Association, now\r\ncarried on under far more favorable circumstances, expanded rapidly. A\r\nfurther extension of the religious life of the University came in 1895,\r\nwhen a University Y.M.C.A. was established by some members of the\r\nStudents' Christian Association who had become dissatisfied with the\r\nolder organization and desired, moreover, to become associated with the\r\nstrong international Y.M.C.A. body. This new organization found a home\r\neventually in McMillan Hall on the corner of State and Huron streets,\r\nwhere it grew in influence with the student body until the time seemed\r\nto many propitious for a reorganization of religious work among the\r\nstudents. This was effected in 1904 through the incorporation of the old\r\nStudents' Christian Association into the Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. with\r\nseparate headquarters in McMillan and Newberry Halls respectively,\r\nalthough the old title, Students' Christian Association, was nominally\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nMcMillan Hall was eventually taken over by the Tappan Presbyterian\r\nAssociation, the owners of the building, and the resulting need for new\r\nquarters for the men led, in 1915, to the successful solicitation of\r\nfunds for a new Y.M.C.A. building. Two years later, on March 2, 1917,\r\nthe new building, known as Lane Hall in honor of Judge V.H. Lane of the\r\nLaw School, who has been President of the Association for many years,\r\nwas formally opened. It stands on the corner of State and Washington\r\nstreets, and represents an outlay of approximately $125,000, of which\r\namount $60,000 was contributed by the Rockefeller Foundation under the\r\nprovision that a like amount be raised within a certain period. It was\r\ndesigned by William A. Otis, 78_e_, of Chicago. Dignified and simple in\r\nits general architectural lines, it is a distinct addition to the public\r\nbuildings of Ann Arbor, and in many respects represents a new style of\r\nbuilding for a Y.M.C.A. This results from the fact that it is designed\r\nprimarily to serve only the religious interests of the students, and\r\ndoes not aim to assume the broader social functions of the Union or the\r\nphysical training supplied in Waterman Gymnasium. Grouped around the\r\nlarge hall or lobby in which the work is centered, are rooms for the\r\nofficers of the Association and offices for the pastors of the Ann Arbor\r\nchurches. A large library and adjoining study is also situated on the\r\nfirst floor. A small but most attractive auditorium, seating some 450\r\npersons, occupies the second floor, with a dining-room and four class\r\nrooms at either end. The basement contains a social or club room and\r\nadditional class rooms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANE HALL\r\nThe University Y.M.C.A. Building]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEWBERRY HALL\r\nThe University Y.W.C.A. Building]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEWBERRY RESIDENCE FOR WOMEN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARBOUR GYMNASIUM FOR WOMEN]\r\n\r\nA final modification of the religious activities in the University in\r\n1919 resulted in an approximate return to the plan of organization of\r\nthe old S.C.A., under which the Association became a clearing house for\r\nall the churches within the University community. Under this plan all\r\nstudents who are church members become _de facto_ members of the\r\nAssociation, and, as far as their church affiliations permit, of the\r\nY.M.C.A. and the Y.W.C.A.; while the two buildings, Lane Hall and\r\nNewberry Hall, are considered exchange centers for all the churches and\r\nreligious organizations, including the Jewish Student Congregation.\r\n\r\nNo single factor in the life of the University has been more effective\r\nthan the close relationship of the Faculty and students with the town,\r\nan entente which has been carefully fostered by the Ann Arbor churches.\r\nA large proportion of the Faculty have always been church members, and\r\nthis has led to very active efforts to reach the students through the\r\nemployment of student pastors, and the establishment of several church\r\nguild houses, which include Harris Hall, Protestant Episcopal; McMillan\r\nand Sackett Halls, Presbyterian; and Tucker Memorial, Baptist; all on\r\nHuron Street, while across from University Hall is the Catholic Chapel\r\nwhich was remodeled from the old home of Professor Morris. There is also\r\nevery prospect that a number of new church buildings of this character\r\nwill be erected in the immediate neighborhood of the Campus within a few\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMichigan students have many songs which celebrate not only the delights\r\nand care-free charm of college life but also their regard for their\r\nUniversity. Some of them are among the most inspiring and beautiful of\r\nall the great body of melodies which our American colleges have\r\ninspired. They have become an essential of undergraduate life and bear\r\nmost effective witness to the sentiment of love and loyalty which,\r\nthough often hidden, binds the student to his alma mater.\r\n\r\nAlways first among Michigan songs is \"The Yellow and the Blue,\" written\r\nby Charles M. Gayley, '78, now of the University of California, when an\r\nAssistant Professor of English in the University. It first appeared in a\r\npamphlet entitled \"Songs of the Yellow and the Blue,\" published in 1889.\r\nThis collection included a number of songs which have always been\r\nfavorites, by Professor Gayley and Professor Fred N. Scott, '84, for\r\nwhich the music, in many cases, was written by Dr. A.A. Stanley. The\r\nwords of \"The Yellow and the Blue,\" which are set to the air of Balfe's\r\n\"Pirate's Chorus,\" are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Sing to the colors that float in the light;\r\n      Hurrah for the Yellow and Blue!\r\n    Yellow the stars as they ride thro' the night,\r\n      And reel in a rollicking crew;\r\n    Yellow the fields where ripens the grain,\r\n    And mellow the moon on the harvest wain;\r\n      Hail!\r\n    Hail to the colors that float in the light;\r\n    Hurrah for the Yellow and Blue!\r\n\r\n    Blue are the billows that bow to the sun\r\n      When yellow-robed morning is due;\r\n    Blue are the curtains that evening has spun,\r\n      The slumbers of Phoebus to woo;\r\n    Blue are the blossoms to memory dear,\r\n    And blue is the sapphire, and gleams like a tear;--\r\n      Hail!\r\n    Hail to the ribbons that nature has spun;\r\n    Hurrah for the Yellow and Blue!\r\n\r\n    Here's to the college whose colors we wear;\r\n      Here's to the hearts that are true!\r\n    Here's to the maid of the golden hair,\r\n      And eyes that are brimming with blue!\r\n    Garlands of blue-bells and maize intertwine;\r\n    And hearts that are true and voices combine;--\r\n      Hail!\r\n    Hail to the college whose colors we wear;\r\n    Hurrah for the Yellow and Blue!\r\n\r\nThe popularity of the old song to Dr. Tappan and the other members of\r\nthe early Faculty, adapted from the old church tune: \"Where, Oh Where,\r\nare the Hebrew Children?\" has been suggested. It is probably one of the\r\noldest of Michigan songs, and has survived through a succession of\r\nstudent and faculty generations; though now it is one of the least of\r\nmany, and is only heard in the variation,--\r\n\r\n    Where, Oh where, are the verdant freshmen?\r\n    They've gone out from their prescribed English,\r\n    Safe now in the Sophomore class,\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nMost of the songs of earlier days are now forgotten. In 1864-65 the\r\n_Palladium_ offered a prize of $10 for the best original song, and of\r\nthe two which were considered of equal merit, one at least survived for\r\nmany years and was sung at all great University occasions. It was set to\r\nthe air of the Marseillaise, and the first stanza is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Come, jolly boys, and lift your voices,\r\n      Ring out, ring out, one hearty song;\r\n    Praise her in whom each son rejoices,\r\n      And let the notes be loud and long.\r\n    'Tis Alma Mater wakes the spirit,\r\n      And prompts the strain of harmony--\r\n      Oh, sing to her triumphantly!\r\n    The glorious theme--do ye not hear it?\r\n    Hurrah! Hurrah! ye sons\r\n      By Alma Mater blest!\r\n    All hail! All hail! her honored name,\r\n      The pride of all the West!\r\n\r\nProfessor Gayley wrote several other songs which have long been\r\ndeservedly popular. One of them, \"Birds of a Feather,\" arranged by\r\nProfessor Stanley to the \"Eton Boating Song,\" is as follows:\r\n\r\n    O whiles we tell of rushes,--\r\n      O whiles we sing and sup,--\r\n    And sip the wine that flushes,\r\n      In Hebe's amber cup,\r\n    And toast the maid that blushes\r\n      And smiles, and then looks up,\r\n    And toast the maid that blushes,\r\n    And smiles, and then looks up!\r\n\r\n    In sad or singing weather,\r\n      In hours of gloom or glee;\r\n    Birds of a feather\r\n      We haunt the same old tree,--\r\n    And sing, sing together,\r\n      O Michigan, of thee!\r\n\r\nAnother song by Professor Fred N. Scott which was popular for many\r\nyears, usually known as \"Ann Arbor, 'tis of thee we sing,\" has fallen\r\nfrom its former esteem, because it was sung to the tune of \"The Watch on\r\nthe Rhine.\" The words of the first verse are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Ann Arbor, 'tis of thee we sing,\r\n    From thee our choicest blessings spring;\r\n    Accept the tribute of our song,\r\n    O Alma Mater, wise and strong.\r\n\r\n    We love thy classic shades and shrines,\r\n    We love thy murm'ring elms and pines;\r\n    Where'er our future homes shall be,\r\n    Our hearts, our hopes are all with thee.\r\n\r\nTwo of Michigan's most beautiful anthems, it must be confessed with\r\nregret, have come of late upon somewhat evil days. The reason probably\r\nlies in the smaller proportion of students of classical training. Yet\r\n\"Laudes Atque Carmina\" cannot be surpassed in the sonorous beauty of\r\nProfessor Gayley's words and the majestic exaltation of the air, written\r\nby Dr. Stanley.\r\n\r\n    Laudes atque carmina,\r\n      Nec hodie nes cras,\r\n    Sed omnia per tempora,--\r\n      Dum locum habeas,\r\n    Tibi sint dulcissima,\r\n      O Universitas;\r\n    At hostes, Pol, perniciter\r\n      Eant _eis korakas_.\r\n\r\n    Chorus:\r\n    O Gloria, Victoria,\r\n      O Decus omnium,\r\n    O salve Universitas,\r\n      Michiganensium, Michiganensium.\r\n\r\n    O clara Universitas,--\r\n      Nec merum Caecubum,\r\n    Nec flores nimium breves,\r\n      Nec nard' Assyrium,--\r\n    At gloriam, victoriam,\r\n      Vovemus merito;\r\n    Nos tui cives, juvenes,\r\n      Tui perpetuo!\r\n\r\nScarcely less beautiful though apparently somewhat too full of classical\r\nallusions for the taste of the modern undergraduate is the \"Goddess of\r\nthe Inland Seas,\" the words of which, by Professor Gayley, are set to an\r\nold air by Joh. Peters.\r\n\r\n    Sing no more the fair Aegean,\r\n      Where the floating Cyclads shine,\r\n    Nor the honey'd slopes Hyblaean,\r\n      Nor the blue Sicilian brine,\r\n    Sing no storied realms of morning\r\n      Rob'd in twilight memories,--\r\n    Sing the land beyond adorning,\r\n      With her zone of inland seas.\r\n\r\n    Lo, the sacred fires of knowledge\r\n      In thy temple are enshrined,--\r\n    Through the cloisters of thy college\r\n      Choruses eternal wind!\r\n    And all other incense scorning,\r\n      Michigan, they bring thee these\r\n    Hearts of ours, and songs of morning,\r\n      Goddess of the inland seas.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing songs are all of a somewhat earlier generation. To these\r\none more should be added. \"The Friar's Song,\" sung for many years by\r\n\"The Friars,\" a convivial student club which was eventually suppressed.\r\nThe organization has lived, however, in the memories of many graduates\r\nand in the words and music of this song which was composed and written\r\nby the members as they drank and sang around their long table. The words\r\nare credited to Harold M. Bowman, '00.\r\n\r\n    Where no one asks the \"who\" or \"why\";\r\n    Where no one doth the sinner ply\r\n    With his embarrassments of guile;\r\n    Where's ne'er a frown but brings a smile,\r\n    And cares are crimes,--'tis sin to sigh,\r\n    'Tis wrong to let a jest go by,\r\n    And hope is truth, and life is nigh,\r\n    The bourns of the Enchanted Isle--\r\n      In College Days.\r\n\r\n    Then raise the rosy goblet high,--\r\n    The singer's chalice,--and belie\r\n    The tongues that trouble and defile;\r\n    For we have yet a little while\r\n    To linger,--You and Youth and I,\r\n      At Michigan.\r\n\r\nMany beautiful songs have been added to the University treasury by the\r\nvarious Michigan Union Operas, of which not a few have survived the\r\nephemeral popularity of the generations which witnessed the\r\nperformances. These include, \"When Night Falls, Dear,\" from\r\n\"Michigenda,\" by Roy Dickinson Welch, '09, who also furnished the music\r\nfor \"A Faithful Pipe to Smoke,\" from \"Culture,\" the words for which were\r\nwritten by Donal Hamilton Haines, '09. The opera \"Koanzaland,\" by Donald\r\nA. Kahn, '07-'10, with the music by Earl V. Moore, '12, furnished two\r\ngood songs, \"In College Days\" and \"Michigan, Good-Bye\" (with the\r\ncollaboration of J. Fred Lawton, '11), while \"Contrarie Mary\" furnished\r\na second \"Friar's Song,\" by Robert G. Beck, 13_l_, and Willis A.\r\nDiekema, '14. All these songs, and many others, are now collected in a\r\nsong-book.\r\n\r\nTwo ever-popular marches celebrate Michigan's prowess in athletics. \"The\r\nVictors,\" by Louis Elbel, '96-'99, never fails to thrill a Michigan man\r\nwhen the band comes on the field, ushering in the team to its great\r\nstrain:\r\n\r\n    Hail! to the victors valiant,\r\n    Hail! to the conq'ring heroes, hail!\r\n    Hail! to Michigan,\r\n    The champions of the West.\r\n\r\nThough these words are somewhat too grandiloquent for all occasions, the\r\nsame spirit which inspires the students to bare their heads and sing\r\n\"The Yellow and the Blue\" at all the great football games, whether in\r\nvictory or defeat, prompts the band to head the students' march back\r\nfrom the field to the stirring strains of this University march, whether\r\nits sentiment is justified or not. Hardly less popular is the football\r\nsong, \"Varsity,\" written by Professor Earl V. Moore, '12, for which the\r\nwords were furnished by J. Fred Lawton, '11.\r\n\r\n    Varsity,\r\n    Down the field, never yield,\r\n    Raise high your shield!\r\n    March on to victory\r\n    For Michigan,\r\n    And the Maize and Blue.\r\n    Oh, Varsity, we're for you,\r\n    Here for you, to cheer for you,--\r\n    We have no fear for you,\r\n    Oh, Varsity.\r\n\r\nNor should another exceedingly popular song of the present time be\r\noverlooked:\r\n\r\n    I want to go back to Michigan,\r\n    To dear Ann Arbor town,\r\n    Back to Joe's and the Orient,\r\n    Back to some of the money I spent.\r\n\r\n    I want to go back to Michigan\r\n    To dear Ann Arbor town,--\r\n    I want to go back; I've got to go back,--\r\n    To Michigan.\r\n\r\nThis song has also been popular at Minnesota, it is said, where, during\r\nthe long period of Michigan victories in football which was at last\r\nbroken in 1919, it was sung with the same words but in a somewhat\r\ndifferent spirit.\r\n\r\nThe official colors of the University are maize and azure blue. Blue was\r\nused officially by the University from early days; but it was not until\r\nthe class of 1867 chose the maize and azure blue as emblematic of the\r\nUniversity that the names of the colors were definitely fixed. As for\r\nthe colors themselves, they have varied widely, and it was not until\r\n1912 that the exact shades were determined by a committee appointed by\r\nthe University Senate.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt but that originally the colors were a deep blue\r\nand the accepted color of Indian corn or maize, as is shown in the\r\nribbons on old diplomas and dance programmes. But gradually the colors\r\nfaded; the blue particularly, from almost a navy blue to a \"baby blue,\"\r\nwhile the maize became an expressionless pale yellow. These colors were\r\nentirely ineffective for decorations, and made it necessary for the\r\nAthletic Association to employ shades entirely different from those\r\ngenerally regarded as the true University colors. It is quite possible\r\nthat a misinterpretation of the words of the song \"The Yellow and the\r\nBlue\" had something to do with the alteration from the original brighter\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry into what \"azure blue\" really was, soon revealed the fact\r\nthat it was generally defined as the clear blue color of the sky or of\r\nthe sea reflecting it, and was further described as that of the\r\nsemi-precious stone lapis lazuli. Cobalt and prussian blue were also\r\ngiven as synonyms. With this clear definition in mind, the committee was\r\nable to fix the colors, and Michigan now has a clear deep blue and the\r\nyellow of Indian corn, with the exact shades officially fixed by samples\r\npreserved among the University's records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFRATERNITIES AND STUDENT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nClubs and societies, organized for almost every conceivable purpose, lay\r\nand academic, have always played an important role in undergraduate\r\naffairs and have formed the most characteristic avenue for\r\nself-expression outside the class room. Many, if not most, of these\r\norganizations have had only a brief existence. Others, in one form or\r\nanother, have continued through long periods, and have often exercised a\r\nstrong, though not always an obvious, influence in the whole fabric of\r\nuniversity life. Within the last twenty-five years, too, athletics have\r\ncome to have a predominant interest, but this aspect of student life at\r\nMichigan will be discussed in a separate chapter. Aside from the\r\norganizations which have accompanied this overwhelming preoccupation of\r\nthe masculine student, probably the most conspicuous evidence of the\r\ngregarious tendencies of the undergraduate have been the fraternities,\r\nand following the introduction of co-education, the sororities, as they\r\nsoon came to be called. After the great struggle between the Faculty and\r\nthe fraternities which culminated in 1850, the fraternities came to have\r\nan acknowledged place in undergraduate affairs. New chapters soon\r\nfollowed after the first three had made their place secure and within\r\nthirty years or so several of the older societies had grown sufficiently\r\nin prestige, and particularly in alumni support, to begin the practice\r\nof owning their own fraternity houses that has now become the rule. The\r\nfirst thought, nowadays, of any newly established fraternity is to find\r\nways and means for building or buying a chapter house.\r\n\r\nAt first, nearly two-thirds of the students were fraternity members; but\r\nthe extraordinary growth of the University soon reduced the proportion\r\nof fraternity men. This came partly as a result of the relative slowness\r\nof the national bodies to establish new chapters in competition with the\r\nsocieties already on the ground, and partly because of the reluctance of\r\nthe fraternities themselves to increase the size of their chapters or to\r\ntake in students from the purely professional schools. For these reasons\r\nthe percentage of fraternity men was reduced to about one-third the\r\ntotal number of students, a proportion which remained fairly constant\r\nfor many years. The rise of fraternities in the professional schools and\r\nthe comparatively recent establishment of many new fraternities,\r\nhowever, has brought the percentage up somewhat, though the growth in\r\ngeneral attendance during the same period has prevented any marked\r\nincrease in the relative numbers of fraternity members over the\r\n\"independents.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the establishment of the first three fraternities, Chi Psi and\r\nBeta Theta Pi in 1845 and Alpha Delta Phi in 1846, whose early\r\nadventures have been noted, some twenty-eight other general fraternities\r\nhave been established. Among the first of these were Delta Kappa\r\nEpsilon, 1855; Sigma Phi, 1858; Zeta Psi, 1858; Psi Upsilon, 1865; Beta\r\nTheta Pi, which had lapsed and was re-established in 1867; Delta Tau\r\nDelta, 1874, re-established 1900; Phi Kappa Psi, 1875; Delta Upsilon,\r\n1876; Sigma Chi, 1877; Phi Delta Theta, 1864, re-established in 1887;\r\nSigma Alpha Epsilon, 1888, and Theta Delta Chi in 1889. Since 1890 this\r\nlist has been more than doubled and includes the re-establishment in\r\n1902 of Phi Gamma Delta originally established in 1885, and Alpha Tau\r\nOmega first established in 1888 and re-established in 1904.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TUG OF WAR ACROSS THE HURON\r\nThe Freshman losing in the annual Freshman-Sophomore Contests]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUR SOCIETY HOUSES\r\n\r\n  Psi Upsilon\r\n  Sigma Phi\r\n  Phi Delta Theta\r\n  Collegiate Sorosis]\r\n\r\nThere are now thirteen sororities in the University. The establishment\r\nof the first one caused great amusement among the fraternities. This was\r\nKappa Alpha Theta, which came in 1879 but fell by the wayside six years\r\nlater and was not revived until 1893. The second arrival on the scene,\r\nGamma Phi Beta, came in 1882, followed by Delta Gamma in 1885, and\r\nCollegiate Sorosis in 1886. The first professional fraternity to be\r\nestablished was Phi Delta Phi, a law fraternity, which organized its\r\nparent chapter in the University in 1869. It was not until 1882 that the\r\nmedical fraternity, Nu Sigma Nu, and the dental fraternity, Delta Sigma\r\nDelta, established their Alpha chapters at Michigan. Since that time\r\nfourteen more professional fraternities have appeared.\r\n\r\nThese fraternities, together with the three house clubs, Trigon,\r\nEmerites and Monks, which in effect are maintained as fraternities,\r\nbring the total number of these organizations in the University to\r\nsixty-four, with an estimated active membership of something over 2,000\r\nUniversity men and women.\r\n\r\nThe first fraternity to establish a chapter house was Alpha Delta Phi,\r\nwhich occupied in the college year 1875-76, the old \"Octagon House,\"\r\nlater the home of Professor Winchell, on the site of the present Hill\r\nAuditorium. The present Psi Upsilon chapter house on the corner of South\r\nUniversity Avenue and State Street was, however, the first chapter house\r\nbuilt for that purpose. It was erected during the year 1879-80 and\r\npreceded by four years the erection of the old Alpha Delta Phi house,\r\nthe second fraternity house to be built. Sigma Phi occupied, in 1882,\r\nthe old home of Professor Moses Coit Tyler, on the beautiful site of the\r\npresent chapter house. The Delta Kappa Epsilon house was built in 1889;\r\nthe old Governor Ashley property on Monroe Street was bought by Delta\r\nUpsilon in 1887; Zeta Psi bought the property on which the present house\r\nstands in 1890; while Phi Kappa Psi bought, in 1893, the picturesque\r\nMillen property on the triangle between Washtenaw and Hill streets they\r\nhad occupied for ten years, one of Ann Arbor's landmarks which has only\r\nrecently been removed to make way for a new chapter house. At the\r\npresent time practically all of the fraternities either own or rent\r\nchapter houses; ordinarily purchasing the property with alumni\r\nassistance, and issuing mortgages, largely held by the alumni, or the\r\nnational organization, for any unpaid balance.\r\n\r\nA comparison of this record of fraternity establishment with similar\r\nfigures from other universities will show that Michigan was one of the\r\nfirst of the larger institutions in which the fraternity system took\r\ndeep root. Student life at Michigan has always been colored by it, and\r\nthe mass of students, from the first, has been divided into fraternity\r\nand non-fraternity elements; an unofficially recognized distinction\r\nwhich has had far-reaching effects in all student affairs, particularly\r\nclass-elections, student athletics, journalism, and general society\r\nmembership. The \"independent\" suffers no particular social disability,\r\nsave as he misses the pleasant club life of the fraternity. Often, if he\r\nis a man of marked ability, he finds his independence a distinct\r\nadvantage in college affairs, for non-fraternity men have always been in\r\nsufficient majority to see that the choice positions go to the\r\n\"independent\" representatives. Within the fraternities, too, there has\r\nalways existed a division between the older and the more recent\r\norganization which was, for a long time, almost as marked as the\r\ndivision between fraternity and non-fraternity men. This came through\r\nthe rivalry that arose between two groups of fraternities. The first,\r\nknown as the \"Palladium,\" took its name from an annual, first published\r\nin 1859, which came to represent the interests of nine fraternities in\r\ncollege up to 1876, while a second group was made up of the fraternities\r\nestablished after that date. The break came through the establishment of\r\nan \"anti-secret\" fraternity, Delta Upsilon, which the older fraternities\r\nrefused to recognize though it later assumed a passive role, and became\r\nmerely non-secret. This organization, however, with the addition of the\r\nnew fraternities as they were established, formed an opposition to the\r\nolder societies who stubbornly maintained their control of the\r\n_Palladium_. This continued until 1891 when the _Palladium_ finally\r\nabsorbed the _Castalian_, the annual of the independents, and _Res\r\nGestae_, the law annual, and became at last a representative University\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nAlthough in 1897 the name was changed to the present _Michiganensian_,\r\nthe spirit of the old \"Palladium,\" as an inner ring of fraternities,\r\nstill existed, particularly in the administration of the annual Junior\r\nHop, which had been a definitely organized student event at least as far\r\nback as 1877, and had been preceded by a similar ball given by the\r\nSeniors since 1868. The older fraternities long maintained an exclusive\r\ncontrol of the Junior Hop. But in 1896 the out-fraternities and the\r\nindependents protested to the Regents, who sustained their contention,\r\nthat the Hop, given in the University buildings, should include\r\nrepresentatives from the entire Junior class. The Palladium fraternities\r\nrefused to participate, and that year two \"Hops\" were given, one by\r\neight fraternities in Toledo, D.K.E. not being represented, and one in\r\nthe Gymnasium by the more recent fraternities and the independents. The\r\nquestion arose again the next year but was eventually settled by a plan\r\nof organization admitting representation upon the committee from all\r\nfraternities and the independents in rotation.\r\n\r\nThe establishment in 1914 of an Inter-Fraternity Conference marked a\r\nfurther step in the relations of these organizations to the University.\r\nFor some time \"the fraternity situation,\" as it was usually spoken of,\r\nhad been increasingly unsatisfactory. Ideals of scholarship were low, or\r\nnon-existent, in practically all of the fraternities. The Junior Hop had\r\nbecome so uncontrolled and extravagant that the Faculty had abolished\r\nit,--while \"rushing\" methods, particularly the practice of pledging boys\r\nlong before they were ready for college, called for drastic action. This\r\nwas strongly recommended by the Committee on Student Affairs in its 1913\r\nReport, and the fraternities were accordingly given notice to \"clean\r\nhouse.\" The result was the establishment of the Inter-Fraternity\r\nConference and the adoption of a constitution just in time to avoid\r\ndecisive action by the University authorities, but not without great\r\nopposition from the Palladium group. The most striking provisions of\r\nthis constitution are: the abolition of premature pledging through a\r\nprovision that all pledging must be done in Ann Arbor and not before the\r\ntenth day previous to the opening of classes; the prohibition of any\r\nfreshman living in a fraternity house, a rule since modified; and most\r\nimportant of all, a provision that no initiate shall have less than\r\neleven hours of credits of at least C grade, and that no student on\r\nprobation or warning shall be initiated. The sororities took similar\r\naction in a provision limiting the amount and character of the rushing\r\nand establishing a fixed day for the extending of \"bids\" to be sent out\r\nfrom one central office.\r\n\r\nThese efforts have all had a most favorable effect on fraternity\r\nscholarship and general deportment, which has been further stimulated by\r\nthe publication of a scholarship chart showing the exact relative\r\nstanding of all the fraternities and house clubs in the University. This\r\nhas revealed a gradual rise in the average of fraternity scholarship,\r\nthough few fraternities, it must be acknowledged, have ever exceeded the\r\naverage for the whole student body, which is between C and B grades.\r\nThere is significant evidence of the success of co-education, too, in\r\nthe fact that few sororities have ever fallen below this average. The\r\npublication of this chart has at least had the effect of establishing a\r\nhealthy rivalry among the fraternities as regards avoiding the last\r\nplace on the list, whatever their attitude may be as regards first\r\nplace; while the scholastic standings of the various fraternities proved\r\ntheir value immediately as an argument with prospective initiates,\r\nsomething almost inconceivable fifteen years ago. The unequivocal\r\nevidence furnished by these charts has also led to numerous\r\ninvestigations and subsequent action on the part of the alumni of many\r\nof the fraternities.\r\n\r\nStudent journalism, though it reflects in the rise and fall of paper\r\nafter paper the changing complexion of successive student generations,\r\nis, after all, one of the best mirrors of undergraduate life. It is no\r\nsurprising matter, therefore, even though it is to be regretted, that no\r\nstudent journal has survived from the University's earlier period,\r\nalthough the _Michiganensian_ has a gallery of ancestors which, at\r\nleast, establishes its lineage. In the very earliest period, whatever\r\nliterary efforts there were, were lost or preserved only in the\r\nmanuscript papers of the early literary societies, which provided the\r\nonly practical outlet for the student who wanted to write. Paper and\r\nprinting were too expensive for actual publication, so it was not until\r\nJune, 1857, that the first real student paper appeared, with the\r\nimpressive title of _Peninsular Phoenix and University Gazetteer_, a\r\nsemi-annual four page sheet whose first page was devoted to lists of\r\nUniversity officers and secret-society members, while its existence as a\r\ngazetteer was justified by a very few \"connubial\" items.\r\n\r\nThe title of this publication was truly prophetic for its successor,\r\n_The University Phoenix_, arose from its ashes the following\r\nNovember,--in the form of an eight-page monthly, the first number of\r\nwhich was largely devoted to a long editorial, an article on the\r\nUniversity Museum of Arts, and another on the Detroit Observatory. This\r\nwas published by Green and Company, an organization which consisted of\r\none S.B. Green, a student of the class of '60 who was a printer, and a\r\nnon-existent company, though it was supposed to have the support of the\r\nthree literary societies. Another publication which had appeared between\r\nthe two issues of the _Phoenix_ was the one issue of the University\r\n_Register_.\r\n\r\nThough a list of fraternity men was published in all of these sheets,\r\nthe fraternities were not satisfied and decided to establish a paper of\r\ntheir own. Thus was born, in 1859, the _Palladium_, a four-page paper\r\nwhich for some time appeared semi-annually. As the first issue was\r\napparently listed as number 2, it is probable that it was considered the\r\nreincarnation of the _Phoenix_. In the issue for December, 1860, the\r\neditor reveals the fact that 800 copies were printed at a cost of $85.\r\nIt was then a booklet of less than 50 pages, bound in glazed paper, with\r\nalmost no literary matter included, although the first number did\r\ncontain a \"Freshman Song,\" the first bit of Michigan undergraduate\r\nverse. Eventually, as we have seen, it became part of the\r\n_Michiganensian_.\r\n\r\nThe _Palladium_ was not long without a rival, which came with the\r\nestablishment of the _Independent_, \"a small quarterly of some forty\r\nviolently written pages,\" illustrating \"not only the bitter feeling\r\nbetween the societies and the independents, but also the hostile\r\nattitude of students towards the Faculty.\" It lasted for just four\r\nissues and was succeeded by the _University Magazine_, which quietly\r\ndied after one gasp, leaving the independents with no representation\r\nuntil 1866 when the _Castalia_ appeared. This survived through five\r\nissues, not to appear again until 1890 when the independents revived it\r\nas the _Castalian_, also merged in 1893 in the _Michiganensian_.\r\n\r\nA combination of two publications which followed the old _Castalia_ in\r\n1867, the _University Chronicle_, an eight-page fortnightly of sometimes\r\n\"rather hot discussions,\" and the _University Magazine_, which had been\r\na most creditable student enterprise, produced one of the long-standing\r\nstudent papers, the _Chronicle_, the first number of which appeared in\r\nSeptember, 1869. For the first few years of its existence, it was one of\r\nthe best college papers in the country, though it made great capital of\r\nthe hostile attitude of the students towards the Regents and Professors\r\nand undertook to speak boldly of \"the evils that have crept into the\r\nUniversity through the mismanagement of the Regents.\" It appeared at\r\nfirst as a large 16-page pamphlet, three columns to the page. At the\r\nsame time the _Chronicle_ was established, a sophomore annual appeared,\r\n_The Oracle_, which had a long and checkered career as a champion of\r\nco-education.\r\n\r\nThis triumvirate of student journals held sway with only occasional\r\nrivalry until a disputed election in 1882 resulted in the establishment\r\nof a new fortnightly, the _Argonaut_, as a rival to the _Chronicle_.\r\nThis journal became a weekly in 1884. The two soon became the organs of\r\nopposing fraternity factions, and assuming a political rather than a\r\nliterary character, lost ground rapidly. An eventual consolidation did\r\nnot save them and the last number of the combined journals appeared in\r\n1891. They were succeeded by two new ventures, the _Daily_, which was\r\nstarted in September, 1890, still with us as an institution in\r\nundergraduate life, and the _Inlander_, whose long and honorable, if\r\nsomewhat spasmodic, career as a literary magazine only came to an end\r\nfinally in 1918. _Wrinkle_, Michigan's first humorous paper, appeared in\r\n1893 and was immediately popular. It survived until 1905, when it also\r\ndied of inanition, to be succeeded after a few years by the present\r\n_Gargoyle_ of varying merit. With the first discontinuance of the\r\n_Inlander_, about the same time _Wrinkle_ died, the student body was\r\nleft with only the _Daily_ and the _Michiganensian_ as unsatisfactory\r\nvehicles for purely literary efforts, save occasional fugitive sheets\r\nwhich usually passed away almost before they appeared. In 1916 the\r\n_Inlander_ was re-established but seemed unable to make a place for\r\nitself and was succeeded in 1919 by the present _Chimes_. Of\r\ndepartmental publications only the _Technic_, established by the\r\nengineers in 1885, is still in existence and thus may honorably claim to\r\nbe the oldest student journal in the University.\r\n\r\nUncertain and varying as the careers of most of these publications have\r\nbeen, they have filled their place in the student scheme of existence;\r\nat least they have given valuable experience to their amateur editors\r\nand publishers and have been a needed vehicle for the expression of\r\nstudent opinion. The long list of editors includes the names of many\r\nalumni who have made their mark, not only in the world of letters, but\r\nin many other fields. The papers that survived longest usually lived by\r\nvirtue of their independence; those that died, did so because they\r\nfilled no recognized need or were too crude or too conscientiously\r\nacademic. Of the present-day publications, the _Daily_ and the\r\n_Michiganensian_ are apparently fixtures. The _Daily_ sometimes tries\r\nall too apparently to ape the defects and not the merits of the greater\r\njournals and suffers from a constantly changing personnel and lack of\r\nexperienced editors, but it is improving and benefiting through a\r\ncertain degree of co-operation with the classes in journalism in the\r\nUniversity. The editor and business manager are given a salary and are\r\nsubject to close supervision by the Board in Control of Student\r\nPublications, which has so wisely administered the affairs of the\r\nvarious papers that a fund of some $30,000 has been saved towards the\r\nestablishment of a University Press. The same is true of the\r\n_Michiganensian_, which has come to be of impressive bulk, and is\r\nusually on the whole a well edited and printed annual reference book\r\nwith numerous illustrations and data concerning all of the student\r\norganizations. A directory of students in the University is also\r\npublished under the supervision of the Board in Control as well as a\r\ntri-weekly paper, the _Wolverine_, by the students of the Summer\r\nSession. The alumni publication, the _Michigan Alumnus_, which first\r\nappeared in 1894, will be mentioned in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nInterest in public speaking and debating has existed almost from the\r\nfirst days of the University, though it was only after the establishment\r\nof the Department of Oratory that instruction began to be given\r\nsystematically and consecutively. Before that time, some elocutionary\r\ntraining had been given by Professor Moses Coit Tyler in combination\r\nwith his work in English Literature, and later by President Hutchins,\r\nthen instructor in Rhetoric and History, who introduced what was then\r\nknown as the Junior Debates. These were continued by his successor,\r\nIsaac N. Demmon, who was to become in a few years Professor of English\r\nLiterature. The great increase in the work in composition and public\r\nspeaking which came with the broadening of the course of study in 1878,\r\nhowever, led to the abandonment of these debates and instruction in the\r\nsubject fell to a low ebb until Professor Trueblood came in 1884 to give\r\none-third of his time to this work. His success in this field eventually\r\nled to his appointment as Professor of Oratory in 1890.\r\n\r\nBut if the powers that be were slow to recognize the desire of the\r\nstudents for instruction in public speaking, there were many more or\r\nless unofficial avenues for those who desired to give vent to their\r\noratorical impulses. Two escape valves existed almost from the first,\r\nthe old literary societies, and the class exhibitions and Commencement\r\nprograms which have been mentioned. The first literary society, Phi Phi\r\nAlpha, was organized in 1842, to be followed, after an internal struggle\r\nin the older society, by Alpha Nu, which has survived to the present\r\ntime and has long been the oldest of student organizations. Adelphi, the\r\nother existing society, was not started until shortly before the demise\r\nof Phi Phi Alpha in 1860. The traditional programmes of these societies\r\nwere largely orations, essays, and concluding debates in which such\r\nmomentous questions as,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_: That the benefits of novel reading will compensate for\r\n     its injuries.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_: That we have sufficient evidence for belief in ethereal\r\n     spirits.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_: That brutes reason.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_: That woman has as much influence in the nation as man.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_: That students should not form matrimonial engagements\r\n     while in college.\r\n\r\nThese societies also maintained literary papers. Phi Phi Alpha had the\r\n\"Castalia,\" Alpha Nu, the \"Sybil,\" and Adelphi, \"The Hesperian.\" In 1868\r\nthey established a series of prize contests, debates for sophomores and\r\njuniors, and orations for seniors. For these first and second prizes\r\nwere awarded at public exhibitions, which never failed to arouse great\r\ninterest. This traditional emphasis on public speaking has been\r\nmaintained consistently down to the present time, and many distinguished\r\nalumni of the University have been numbered among the contestants.\r\n\r\nFor many years the two societies Alpha Nu and Adelphi have occupied two\r\nrooms on the fourth floor of University Hall, the only student\r\norganizations entirely independent of Faculty patronage thus recognized.\r\nWhy they have not come to occupy the prominent place that two similar\r\norganizations hold at Princeton, the Clio and Whig societies, whose two\r\nmarble temples are one of the distinguishing marks of Princeton's\r\nCampus, is a matter for speculation. Probably the fact that Princeton\r\nlong remained a college while Michigan early became a university with a\r\nmore inclusive curriculum, will best explain it. As it is, however,\r\nthese societies have in the past done a great service for the University\r\nand deserve to survive. They are not, however, the only student\r\norganizations which have had exercise in public speaking as their reason\r\nfor existence, for many such have come and gone, only to be remembered\r\nby their own student generation and by the heavy weight of their\r\nclassical names. Such were a multitude of debating clubs which sprang up\r\nin the \"60's\" under such impressive titles as \"Homotrapezoi,\"\r\n\"Philozetian,\" \"Panarmonian,\" or, in the Law Department, the less\r\npretentious \"Douglas,\" \"Clay,\" and \"Lincoln\" Societies which were the\r\nforerunners of the present Jeffersonian and Webster Societies. A\r\nlatter-day organization has been the long popular \"Toastmaster's Club\"\r\nwhich aims to perpetuate the doubtful joys of after-dinner oratory.\r\nOther means of self-expression for those oratorically bent, were those\r\nformal exhibitions of which the long-popular annual Junior Exhibition\r\nwas the most prominent. Nowadays, the only vestige of student\r\nparticipation in programs of this character remains in the annual Class\r\nDay Exercises.\r\n\r\nAnother organization which stimulated interest in platform speaking was\r\nthe Students' Lecture Association, which was until recently one of the\r\nmost successful undergraduate enterprises. It was organized in\r\nSeptember, 1854, and continued for nearly sixty years to bring\r\ndistinguished and sometimes, judged by later-day standards,\r\nundistinguished speakers before student audiences. It ceased to exist in\r\n1912, but only after the broadening interests of the University began to\r\nattract to Ann Arbor many prominent visitors whose addresses have been\r\nusually given free of charge, while at the same time the multiplication\r\nof other forms of entertainment lessened the attractions of the\r\ntraditional lecture course. But an association which, in its day,\r\nbrought to Ann Arbor such men as Emerson, Bayard Taylor, Horace Mann,\r\nWendell Phillips, Theodore Parker, Henry Ward Beecher, Winston Spencer\r\nChurchill, Henry M. Stanley, Wu Ting Fang, and Presidents Harrison,\r\nMcKinley, Cleveland, and Wilson, played no minor role in University\r\nlife. That the privilege of hearing some of these speakers was not\r\nalways properly appreciated is shown by the comments of the editor of\r\none of the local papers on a lecture by Emerson.\r\n\r\n     The subject of the lecture was \"Human Beauty,\" rather a singular\r\n     subject, it strikes us, from so homely a man as Mr. Emerson. Mr.\r\n     Emerson is not a pleasing speaker--in fact, is an awkward speaker,\r\n     and yet he demands the utmost attention of every hearer.\r\n\r\nWith the gradual organization of the Department of Oratory, public\r\nspeaking soon came to have a recognized place among student interests,\r\nand eventually inter-collegiate debates and contests were organized to\r\nstimulate student interest. These were first inaugurated by the\r\nOratorical Association, which, soon after its establishment in 1889,\r\nissued an invitation to neighboring universities to form an Oratorical\r\nUnion. This resulted in the Northern Oratorical League, which has long\r\nmaintained an annual series of inter-collegiate contests and debates.\r\nThe representatives of the University are selected only after several\r\ncontests and preliminary debates in the various societies, with an\r\naverage of at least fifty candidates participating. Michigan has always\r\nmaintained a leading position in this form of undergraduate activity and\r\nof the twenty-nine inter-collegiate contests in which she has taken part\r\nshe has won nine first honors and four second honors. The University has\r\nalso participated in some sixty-four inter-collegiate debates, of which\r\nshe has won forty-two; her nearest rival being Northwestern, with nine\r\nvictories. Eleven of these debates were won in succession, and\r\ntwenty-four by the unanimous decision of the judges.\r\n\r\nThis form of inter-collegiate rivalry has been greatly stimulated by a\r\nmedal and testimonial of $85 given to the winner of the annual\r\nUniversity Contest by the Chicago alumni and by similar prizes to the\r\nwinners of the inter-collegiate contests and debates.\r\n\r\nInterest in the drama on the part of the students was of comparatively\r\nslow development, though in recent years it has come to be one of the\r\nmost conspicuous \"student activities.\" While a \"Shakespeare Club\"\r\nexisted as early as 1860, the stage did not hold a particularly high\r\nplace in public regard in the University's earlier years, and good plays\r\nwere seldom seen in Ann Arbor. The celebrated actress, Mrs. Scott\r\nSiddons, gave several recitals in the seventies, while a performance of\r\n_Hamlet_, given in 1879 by Lawrence Barrett, was received with the\r\nhighest praise. His visit gave an impetus to dramatic affairs and led to\r\nthe organization of a Barrett Club which gave a performance of _Dollars\r\nand Cents_ in 1880--the first recorded amateur dramatic performance in\r\nthe University. But it was not until two years later that the\r\nUniversity's dramatic history may be said to have begun with the two\r\nCommencement plays, the _Adelphi_ of Terence, given in Latin under the\r\ndirection of Professor Charles M. Gayley, '74, and Racine's _Les\r\nPlaideurs_, in French, under Assistant Professor Paul R. de Pont of the\r\nDepartment of French.\r\n\r\nFrom that time on interest in college dramatics steadily increased.\r\nProfessor de Pont, whose interest in student life never flagged, took a\r\nleading part in the presentation of several plays, and one opera,\r\nGilbert and Sullivan's _Iolanthe_ (1883), by companies of students and\r\nfaculty members. Largely through his efforts a University Dramatic Club\r\nwas organized in 1885 and gave such plays as _A Scrap of Paper_ (1885)\r\nand _The Memoirs of the Devil_ (1888), which \"caused the student body to\r\nsit up and take notice.\" Plays of this lighter character were all that\r\nwere attempted until 1890, when another Latin play, Plautus'\r\n_Menaechmi_, was given so successfully under the direction of Professor\r\nJ.H. Drake, '85, that it was later presented in Chicago. This was the\r\nlast effort in classical drama until twenty-six years later, when the\r\n_Menaechmi_ was repeated with great success in Hill Auditorium on March\r\n30, 1916. This was followed in 1917 by Euripides' _Iphigenia Among the\r\nTaurians_, given by the students in Greek, for which special music in\r\nthe ancient Greek modes was written by Dr. A.A. Stanley.\r\n\r\nThe old Dramatic Club was eventually disbanded in the early '90's, only\r\nto be succeeded by another student organization, the still existing\r\nComedy Club, which has had a varying career. Soon after its organization\r\nit became an exceedingly close corporation among certain fraternities\r\nand confined its offerings to light comedies and farces of the type that\r\noffered no great difficulties, such as _The Private Secretary_, _All the\r\nComforts of Home_, and _My Friend from India_. A reorganization of the\r\nClub in 1908 made membership dependent upon real ability, and since that\r\ntime Farquahar's _Recruiting Officer_, (1908); Barrie's _Admirable\r\nCrichton_, (1909); Gogol's _Inspector_, (1910); Percy McKaye's\r\n_Scarecrow_, (1914), and Barrie's _Alice Sit by the Fire_, (1919), are\r\nfairly representative of the plays given.\r\n\r\nThe reorganization of the Comedy Club came largely because of the\r\nsuccessful efforts of the Deutscher Verein and the Cercle Francais, to\r\ngive a series of the best plays in German and French literature. The\r\nlist of these productions has been a long and creditable one, those in\r\nGerman including, after their first performance, _Der Hochzeitsreise_\r\nby Benedix, in 1904; _Die Journalisten_, (1906 and 1912); _Minna von\r\nBarnhelm_, (1908); _Egmont_, (1909); and _Der Dummkopf_, (1911). Since\r\nthe French Circle made its debut in 1907, with _Les Deux Timides_ by\r\nLabiche, and Moliere's _Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme_, several other\r\ncomedies by Moliere have been most successfully given; as well as\r\nBeaumarchais' _Barbier de Seville_, (1909); Rostand's _Les Romanesques_,\r\n(1911); and Pailleron's modern comedy _Le Monde ou l'On s'Ennuie_,\r\n(1912).\r\n\r\nSomewhat different from these revivals of the best in dramatic\r\nliterature, have been the far more popular Michigan Union Operas,\r\nwritten and produced almost entirely by students. Originally designed as\r\na means for raising funds for the Union, always needed, particularly in\r\nthe earliest days, they speedily became an institution in undergraduate\r\nlife. All the librettos, with one or two exceptions, have been the work\r\nof students, and the same is true of the music, which has often\r\ndeveloped an extraordinary vein of undergraduate talent. In fact, more\r\nthan once it has been the music which has given these operas their chief\r\nmerit. Save for one war-time emergency, when University women\r\nparticipated, the entire cast has always been recruited from the men of\r\nthe University and the burlesque of the \"chorus girls\" has always been\r\none of the perennial charms of the opera in undergraduate estimation.\r\nThe first opera, given in 1908, was entitled _Michigenda_ and became\r\ninstantly popular, not only because of its novelty and the excellence of\r\nits music, but also because its plot was built about the local color of\r\nundergraduate life, a precedent which, unfortunately, has not always\r\nbeen followed in later operas. The 1920 opera, _George Did It_, was\r\nartistically as well as financially the most successful of the Union's\r\nproductions. Five or six performances are usually given in Ann Arbor,\r\nand of late years a trip during the spring vacation through the cities\r\nof Michigan and occasionally to Chicago has drawn large audiences of\r\nalumni and others, attracted by the real merit and novelty of this\r\nstudent effort. Not to be outdone by the men of the University, the\r\njunior class women have also, for some years, presented a similar\r\nextravaganza which, though not open to the general public, is always\r\nnoted for its cleverness and real humor.\r\n\r\nFor some twelve years also a feature of the Commencement program has\r\nbeen the annual play given by the senior girls, usually on Tuesday\r\nevening of Commencement Week. The list of plays presented includes, _She\r\nStoops to Conquer_, (1905); _The Knight of the Burning Pestle_, (1906);\r\n_Cranford_, (1908); Euripides' _Alcestis_, (1912), in which the\r\nclassical entrance to Alumni Memorial Hall was used most effectively;\r\n_Prunella_, (1914); _The Piper_, (1916); and in 1919, Percy McKaye's _A\r\nThousand Years Ago_. Within recent years, \"Masques,\" an organization of\r\nUniversity women, has given unusually artistic performances of Pinero's\r\n_The Amazons_, (1918), and Barrie's _Quality Street_, (1919). The\r\nDepartment of Oratory has also interested itself in the drama and is\r\nresponsible for several well-considered presentations of such plays as\r\nGalsworthy's _Silver Box_; Kennedy's _The Servant in the House_, (1916);\r\nIbsen's _Pillars of Society_, (1917); and Masefield's _Tragedy of Nan_,\r\n(1918).\r\n\r\nContemporary interest in pageantry has likewise not been without its\r\neffect in the University, as was shown by a praiseworthy though perhaps\r\nover-ambitious pageant, _Joan of Arc_, given under the auspices of the\r\nWoman's League on Ferry Field in 1914, and a less elaborate but more\r\neffective celebration of the Shakespeare Centenary two years later,\r\nentitled _The Queen's Progress_, given in Hill Auditorium. The\r\nCosmopolitan Club, composed of the foreign students, has also taken\r\nadvantage of the same spacious stage to give two elaborate\r\nentertainments in 1916 and 1917, an _All-Nation Review_, and _The Magic\r\nCarpet_.\r\n\r\nThis brief outline of student dramatic efforts in recent years reveals a\r\nmultiplicity of interested organizations as well as a wide variety of\r\nofferings. Necessarily this has given rise to rivalries and sometimes\r\ninadequate preparation, though it has stimulated a vital and intelligent\r\ninterest in the drama as an actual form of artistic expression. One of\r\nthe greatest needs these student actors and their Faculty directors\r\nexperience, is a university theater which will, in effect, be an actual\r\ndramatic workshop. These conditions have led to the recent organization\r\nof a University Dramatic Society, composed largely of members of the\r\nFaculty and a few students, whose aim is to correlate the work of the\r\nvarious dramatic organizations of the University and to arouse interest\r\nin the project for a Campus Theater. As a producing organization it made\r\nits bow in December, 1919, when, with the co-operation of the Michigan\r\nUnion, it produced a most finished performance of Reginald DeKoven's\r\noperetta, _Red Feather_.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of any musical organization in the University occurs\r\nin some reminiscences of the class of 1846. Winfield Smith says that the\r\nflute was very popular in those days, and that \"several could be heard\r\nin different rooms when the windows were open on a summer evening.\" A\r\nquartette orchestra was organized by John S. Newberry, '47, while the\r\nfirst vocal music was started by Fletcher Marsh, of the first class to\r\ngraduate, in 1844, which \"rapidly developed into a good chorus.\" Dr.\r\nNathaniel West, '46, tells of the fine singing in the chapel exercises\r\nof his time, with \"excellent support from a University Band of nine\r\npieces.\" With evident pride he confesses: \"This hand used to slide the\r\ntrombone and sometimes the cornet.\"\r\n\r\nInterest in music apparently continued and was actively fostered by\r\nProfessor Frieze after he came to the University. An exceptionally fine\r\nmusician himself, he presided at the organ in one of the local churches\r\nfor many years, and took every occasion to encourage good music among\r\nthe students. The early numbers of the _Palladium_ and its rivals\r\nmention many ephemeral musical organizations beginning in 1859 with a\r\nnine-piece orchestral club, \"Les Sans Souci.\" Evidently the name was too\r\nmuch for this modest effort and the same or a similar organization\r\nappears as the \"Amateur Musical Club\" the following year. The same issue\r\nof the _Palladium_ also lists a University Choir of four persons. After\r\nthat time hardly a year passes without vocal and instrumental musical\r\norganizations in some form; in 1863 we have the \"Junior Glee Club,\" and\r\nthe \"Sophomore AEolians,\" while in 1865 a \"Cremona Club\" appears. In\r\n1867-68 the first \"University Glee Club\" of eight members was organized\r\nand in 1870, the senior year of its members, it gave some twenty-six\r\nmost successful concerts throughout the State. They appeared in\r\nUniversity caps, apparently something entirely new, as some thought they\r\nwere members of a fire company, while others \"mistook them for Arabs\r\nfrom Forepaugh's circus.\" The example set by this successful club, to\r\nwhich belongs the credit of elevating and popularizing college songs,\r\nwas not immediately followed, however, and there were several years when\r\nthe glee club was dormant. With its effectual revival in 1884, the\r\nhistory of the University Glee Club has been continuous to the present\r\ntime. It was supplemented in 1889-90 by the Banjo Club and in 1895 and\r\n1896 by the Mandolin Club--and after that time the triple organization\r\nwent by the name of the University Musical Clubs. The first extended\r\ntrip was taken in 1890 when the organization visited several Michigan\r\ncities, and also Chicago, Madison, Minneapolis, and St. Paul. In 1896\r\nthe trip went as far afield as Salt Lake City, an extensive itinerary\r\nwhich crippled more than one cash balance. Since that time, under more\r\ncareful management, several most successful trips have been made to the\r\nPacific Coast.\r\n\r\nThe various University orchestras and musical clubs supplied the\r\nUniversity's needs until, in 1895, the University Band was organized.\r\nThis suffered a precarious existence, though much appreciated by the\r\nstudents, until in 1914 the Regents made an appropriation for its\r\nsupport which enabled it to blossom out as one of the most creditable\r\ncollege bands in any American University. Not only does it play at all\r\nfootball and baseball games, but it has come to be indispensable during\r\nsuch occasions as the annual Commencement.\r\n\r\nThough not strictly a student organization, the University Musical\r\nSociety and the Choral Union, since their organization in 1879-80, have\r\nhad as their main object the musical welfare of the student body, and so\r\nsuccessful have they been in their effort, that Ann Arbor has become one\r\nof the musical centers of the country. The modest concerts first given\r\nby the Choral Union, composed largely of students, prepared the way for\r\nthe establishment in 1893 of the annual May Festival, which has become\r\nan established event of the University year under the energetic and able\r\ndirection of Dr. A.A. Stanley, who has well accomplished the task he\r\nset himself when he came to Ann Arbor in 1888, to create a true musical\r\natmosphere in the University of Michigan. The number of concerts given\r\nunder the auspices of the Choral Union, including the May Festival\r\nConcerts, now totals 318.\r\n\r\nThe gregarious club-forming habit, as we have seen, began as far as the\r\nUniversity is concerned almost with the admission of the first class. A\r\nlist of such organizations might be compiled from old _Palladiums_ and\r\n_Michiganensians_, but it would be to little purpose. In most cases\r\nthese societies have been ephemeral, and if they did survive their own\r\ngenerations, they soon lapsed into pale shadows, or faded away, with no\r\none to mark their passing. There are certain societies, however, which\r\nhave been in existence some time, that serve to mark a definite trend in\r\nundergraduate life, though most of them reflect not so much scholastic\r\nattainment as personal popularity. The most conspicuous of these is\r\n\"Michigamua,\" a society which was organized in 1902 as an all-senior\r\norganization. It has always stressed the Indian tradition in its\r\npractices and names, and has made a picturesque ceremony of its annual\r\n\"rope-in\" of new members, who are surrounded on a certain day in spring\r\nwith a howling band of painted braves. Similar societies in other\r\ndepartments and classes soon followed, and we now have the \"Griffins,\"\r\nanother all-campus society; \"Druids,\" senior literary; \"Sphinx,\" junior\r\nliterary; \"Vulcans,\" senior engineering; \"Triangle,\" junior engineering;\r\n\"Archons,\" junior laws; \"Galens,\" medical; \"Alchemists,\" chemical\r\nstudents; \"Craftsmen,\" Masonic students; \"Quarterdeck,\" marine\r\nengineering; as well as several similar societies among the women,\r\nnotably the \"Senior Society\" and \"Mortarboard.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the real \"honor\" societies, those whose membership is in itself\r\nan academic honor, there are several whose members are selected with\r\nFaculty co-operation. These are best illustrated by Phi Beta Kappa, the\r\noldest inter-collegiate organization, which was established at Michigan\r\nonly after long opposition centering about the introduction of a marking\r\nsystem, the absence of which was long a special characteristic of the\r\nUniversity. In spite of this, many alumni were elected at the time of\r\nits establishment in 1907, upon the special recommendation of older\r\nmembers of the Faculty whose co-operation had been requested. Five years\r\nbefore the time when Phi Beta Kappa was established, Sigma Xi, a similar\r\norganization, was inaugurated as a recognition of excellence in science.\r\nTau Beta Pi in engineering likewise came in the field in 1906. There\r\nfollowed quickly, after this auspicious start, the following societies,\r\nmost of them of national scope; Alpha Omega Alpha, in the Medical\r\nSchool; Tau Sigma Delta, in Architecture; Phi Lambda Upsilon, in\r\nChemistry; the Order of the Coif, and also the Woolsack, in the Law\r\nSchool; Phi Sigma, in Science; Pi Delta Epsilon, in Journalism; Iota\r\nSigma Pi for women specializing in chemistry; and Phi Alpha Tau for\r\nstudents in oratory. Analogous to these distinctions are the annual\r\nappointments to the editorial board of the _Law Review_, open to the\r\nbest senior students in the Law School.\r\n\r\nA society organized by upper classmen in 1900, \"Quadrangle,\" for many\r\nyears maintained outstanding scholastic ability as well as a certain\r\ndegree of popularity as qualifications for membership. Its traditions\r\nhave perhaps changed somewhat through a too great, though perhaps\r\ninevitable instructorial complexion and the abandonment of its original\r\nemphasis on literature and the arts. Among the women a similar\r\nassociation is found in \"Stylus,\" a society established in 1908. Similar\r\nsocieties, which emphasize the literary and scientific interests of\r\ntheir members, are the University Branches of the American Institutes of\r\nElectrical and Mechanical Engineers, the \"Prescott Club\" of students in\r\nPharmacy, the \"Architectural Society,\" the \"Commerce Club,\" and another\r\nwomen's society, \"Athena.\"\r\n\r\nFor some years there was a marked tendency in the University to form\r\nsectional clubs, such as the \"Rocky Mountain,\" \"New York,\"\r\n\"Pennsylvania,\" and \"New England\" clubs, usually with their own house\r\nand dining-room, organized somewhat on the example of the fraternities.\r\nThe impulse, however, has lapsed somewhat, though the foreign students\r\nin the University still maintain the \"Cosmopolitan Club,\" a very active\r\norganization with national affiliations, as well as a \"Chinese Students\r\nClub,\" a \"South African Union,\" and a \"Nippon Club.\"\r\n\r\nIn the earlier years the students came almost entirely from nearby towns\r\nin Michigan, many registering from little hamlets now almost forgotten.\r\nBy 1850, however, almost one-third of the total of 64 students in the\r\nacademic department were from outside the State, some even hailing from\r\nas far as New England. Ten years later almost half the 526 enrolled were\r\nfrom other states than Michigan, with a sprinkling from Canada. The same\r\nwas true of the 1,112 students in 1870, though by this time practically\r\nall sections of the country were represented--even California. Less than\r\nhalf the students in 1880 were from Michigan, 642 out of a total\r\nenrolment of 1,427, a condition that also held true in 1890, when the\r\nproportion was 1,019 out of 2,153. But by 1900 Michigan was again\r\nsending more than half the students in the University, 2,009 out of\r\n3,440; and the same was true in 1910 with 2,832 out of 5,383 and again\r\nin 1920 with 5,793 out of 9,401.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hinsdale in his \"History\" publishes a significant little table\r\nshowing that in 1870 the ratio of Michigan students to the population of\r\nthe State was one to 2,300. This ratio was increased slightly ten years\r\nlater and then dropped to one in 1,802 in 1890, one in 1,206 in 1900,\r\nand to one in 992 in 1910. The 1920 census shows one in 636.\r\n\r\nThe enrolment of foreign students in the University is also significant.\r\nAside from students registering from Canada, who came almost from the\r\nfirst, the first appreciable showing of foreign students came in the\r\neighties, with nine enrolled in 1880. In 1890 there were forty-three\r\nincluding twenty-one from Japan, but ten years later the number had\r\ndropped to nineteen. This was due partly to the fact that there were\r\nonly seven Japanese students, while the seven from Porto Rico and two\r\nfrom Hawaii were no longer \"foreign.\" The total, excluding fourteen from\r\nthe United States dependencies and twenty-five from Canada, was\r\nsixty-eight in 1910. Of this number eleven students were from China; a\r\nlittle band which grew to thirty-six in 1919, when they formed no\r\ninconsiderable proportion of the 140 foreign students enrolled, strongly\r\norganized for social and educational purposes and affiliated with\r\nsimilar organizations in other universities. Japan sent eighteen and\r\nSouth Africa twenty-eight the same year. Aside from these, seventy-four\r\nwere registered from Canada and fourteen from Porto Rico, the\r\nPhilippines, and Hawaii. Of late years there has also been a marked\r\nincrease of students from Central and South America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nATHLETICS\r\n\r\n\r\nMichigan differs in no respect from other American universities in the\r\ngeneral and, some would have it, the extravagant interest in outdoor\r\nsports which have come to be defined under the general term \"athletics.\"\r\nThis emphasis on contests and games of strength and skill is universal\r\nand is woven into the very fabric of student life in all our\r\nuniversities and colleges. We cannot therefore avoid the conclusion that\r\nit is an inevitable and characteristic expression of the American\r\nspirit. It is only natural for the sons and grandsons of the men who\r\nsettled this country to take an interest in wholesome and vigorous\r\nsports; in fact it would be a sad commentary on the degeneracy of the\r\nmodern generation if such an expression of their inheritance were not\r\nevident. But a distinctively American attitude towards sport is also\r\nmanifested in the intense personal and university rivalries developed,\r\nthe very rock upon which the modern system of inter-collegiate athletics\r\nrests, no less than in the genius for organization and systemization\r\nwhich has, within the last twenty-five years, made organized athletics\r\nsuch a tremendous factor in the life of all American universities.\r\n\r\nWhatever changes the future is to bring in the development and control\r\nof inter-collegiate athletics, our universities cannot very well escape\r\nthe fundamental fact that they have become an integral part of our\r\nuniversity system, and that, rather than attempting a change by radical\r\nmeasures, they can best correct any present abuses by wise regulation,\r\nby a constant effort toward a modification of the present overwhelming\r\nemphasis on the one game, football, and above all, by a consistent\r\nencouragement of universal participation on the part of the students in\r\nsome form of college sport. This, in fact, is the latest development. It\r\nis not so much a reform as a return to older traditions, from which we\r\nhave departed only in comparatively recent years, as the following\r\nreview of Michigan's athletic history will show. This survey is offered,\r\nhowever, not so much because of its relation to the general development\r\nof the present-day attitude toward sports in American universities as\r\nbecause it may have particular interest for every Michigan graduate,\r\nwhether he counts himself a radical or a conservative in matters\r\nathletic.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that there was almost no thought of organized\r\nsport in the early days. Nathaniel West, '46, once told the Washington\r\nalumni, that \"among our athletics were various forms of activity--the\r\nfoot race from a quarter to a half mile,--baseball, a few rods from the\r\nstile,\"--and what will seem certainly a novel event to a modern\r\nathlete,--\"sawing our own wood and carrying it upstairs.\" Edmund\r\nAndrews, the President of '49, has also left a record of his time.\r\n\r\n     Athletics were not regularly organized, nor had we any gymnasium.\r\n     We played base-ball, wicket ball, two-old-cat, etc., but there was\r\n     no foot-ball nor any trained \"teams.\" There was mere ex tempore\r\n     volunteering. We had jumping wickets in the same way. Fencing and\r\n     boxing were totally neglected. The Huron River furnished little\r\n     opportunity for boating.\r\n\r\nThis we may take as a fair picture of athletic activities for many\r\nyears. Cricket was undoubtedly the first sport to be organized in the\r\nUniversity, as the _Palladium_ for 1860-61 gives the names of the eight\r\nofficers and twenty-five members of the \"Pioneer Cricket Club,\" while\r\nthe Regents' Report for June, 1865, shows an appropriation of $50 for a\r\ncricket ground on the Campus,--the first official recognition of\r\nathletics in the University. The game of wicket, which was a\r\nmodification of cricket, was played with a soft ball five to seven\r\ninches in diameter, and with two wickets (mere laths or light boards)\r\nlaid upon posts about four inches high and some forty feet apart. The\r\n\"outs\" tried to bowl these down, and the \"ins\" to defend them with\r\ncurved broad-ended bats. It was necessary to run between the wickets at\r\neach strike.\r\n\r\nThe need for a gymnasium was speedily recognized, but the agitation for\r\nit among the students continued for thirty years before the present\r\nbuilding was finally completed in 1894. The first gymnasium was an old\r\nmilitary barracks which was transformed into a gymnasium of a sort about\r\nthe year 1858. It stood near the site of the old heating plant at the\r\nside of the present Engineering Building, and as it was very open to the\r\nweather, resting only on poles sunken in the ground and with a tan bark\r\nfloor, it was used only in warm weather. The apparatus consisted of a\r\nfew bare poles, ropes, and rings. Even this make-shift was short-lived,\r\nfor in 1868 the class of '70 erected a \"gymnasium in embryo\" described\r\nby a graduate of '75 as \"two uprights with a cross-beam and ropes\r\ndangling from eye-bolts--the remains of some prehistoric effort towards\r\nmuscular development,\" which was to be found \"back of the\r\nMuseum\";--otherwise the old North Wing. Mark Norris, '79, thus pictures\r\nthe comparatively primitive state of athletics in the University of his\r\nday:\r\n\r\n     The athletic side of the University was almost wholly undeveloped\r\n     in 1875. There was no organization and no chance for systematic\r\n     work. The absence of a gymnasium and practice ground will account\r\n     for this. Football was a contest between classes, and a mob of 100\r\n     to 150 men on a side chasing the pig-skin over the Campus was a\r\n     sight to make the football expert of today go into convulsions. We\r\n     had a little base-ball of the \"butter fingers\" type. At one time we\r\n     had a boat-club, which navigated the raging Huron above the dam in\r\n     a six-oared barge.\r\n\r\nBut with the opening of the year 1885 the old rink, later to become the\r\narmory, was fitted up as a gymnasium and a great impetus was given to\r\nall athletic interests, which by this time were beginning to be\r\norganized. As a natural result the student demand for a real gymnasium\r\nwas becoming more and more vociferous. As far back as 1868 the\r\n_University Chronicle_ had voiced the sentiment in a two-column\r\neditorial, in which the writer thus describes the awful state of the\r\nUniversity, when the only form of exercise was the opportunity to,--\r\n\r\n     walk around two or three squares, down to the post office and back\r\n     to our rooms again. This already has become a melancholy task; but\r\n     we must choose it, or its sadder alternative,--the old buck-saw.\r\n     True there are students among us who _will_ have exercise if\r\n     cramming professors are ever so vexed. They will not study on\r\n     Sunday; they escape to the woods, admire nature--desecrate the\r\n     Sabbath. They find relaxation at the billiard table, make effigies\r\n     in the night to be burned in the morning, remove side-walks,\r\n     dislocate gates, or arm-in-arm parade the side-walk singing: \"Happy\r\n     is the maid who shall meet us.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1865 the efforts of the students resulted in a fund of something over\r\n$4,000. The Legislature that year almost gave the necessary\r\nappropriation for a gymnasium provided the students contributed what\r\nthey had raised. But the project finally fell through and it was not\r\nuntil 1891, when Joshua W. Waterman, of Detroit, long a patron of sports\r\nin the University, offered to give $20,000, provided a like amount be\r\nraised from other sources, that the building became assured. Three years\r\nlater Waterman Gymnasium was at last completed at a cost of $61,876.49\r\ntoward which sum private donors had contributed $49,524.34. The $6,000\r\nwhich the students eventually raised through so many years of effort\r\nwere used for equipment. The new \"gym\" was 150 feet long by 90 feet\r\nwide, with a running track in the balcony of 14 laps to the mile. These\r\naccommodations proved ample for many years; but the recent growth of the\r\nstudent body finally made an increase in space imperative, and in 1916\r\nan extension of 48 feet was added at each end, making the main floor 248\r\nfeet long with a ten-lap running track.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATERMAN GYMNASIUM FOR MEN]\r\n\r\nThe interest in all forms of outdoor athletics, which was developing\r\nrapidly by 1890, made an athletic field no less necessary than a\r\ngymnasium. The corner of the Campus where the Gymnasium now stands,\r\nwhich, from the earliest days of baseball had been devoted to athletics,\r\nwas crowded and inconvenient, even for practice games; while the old\r\nfair grounds in the southeastern part of the city were not under\r\nUniversity control, besides being ill-adapted to college games. The\r\nstreets and Campus were popular for impromptu games, although the arm of\r\nthe law was unduly active in the spring, and \"the batting of balls\" was\r\nconspicuously forbidden on a sign which long decorated the south wall of\r\nthe Museum. The Regents recognized this need of a great playground,\r\nhowever, and purchased what is now the south ten acres of Ferry Field in\r\n1891, though it was not opened to the students until 1893. This went by\r\nthe name of \"Regents' Field\" until 1902, when the Hon. D.M. Ferry of\r\nDetroit gave an additional twenty-one acres lying between the old field\r\nand the University, and furnished funds for the present impressive\r\nentrance gates and ticket offices, since which time it has been known by\r\nthe name of the donor. Subsequent purchases of neighboring property have\r\nincreased the total to nearly eighty acres. Though this is by no means\r\nall in use at present, thirty-eight acres are graded, drained, and\r\nenclosed on three sides by a high brick wall. Two great stands, one of\r\nconcrete, accommodate nearly 25,000 spectators at the \"big games,\" while\r\nan attractive club house at one end furnishes accommodations for the\r\nplayers and members of visiting teams.\r\n\r\nAn effective student athletic organization was only less tardy in making\r\nits appearance than the long-awaited gymnasium and athletic field. In\r\ncontrast to the modern student journals, the earliest files of the\r\n_Chronicle_ are distinguished by their exceedingly rare references to\r\nathletic events, and then only in a very occasional modest item giving\r\nthe immodest score of some class contest, such as the baseball game\r\nbetween '71 and '72 on May 29, 1869, when the score ran 50 to 36.\r\nShortly after this time came the first student athletic organization,\r\ninformally known as the \"Baseball Clubs\" which became the Baseball\r\nAssociation in 1876. A similar Football Association was organized in\r\n1873 and continued until 1878 when both clubs were merged in the first\r\nAthletic Association of the University. This was the organization\r\nresponsible for the student fund for the Gymnasium. But successful as\r\nthe new organization proved in financial matters, it soon fell into the\r\nalmost inevitable desuetude of so many student undertakings and\r\nfinally, in 1884, fell \"victim of the football and baseball teams which\r\nit sought to control.\"\r\n\r\nIts successor was the present Athletic Association, organized in 1890\r\nthrough a consolidation of all the athletic interests in the University.\r\nThis Association was long maintained almost exclusively by the students\r\nwhose voluntary membership was marked by a little \"athletic button\" of\r\nvarying design, without which no student in good standing with his\r\nfellows would be seen. With the establishment of a general athletic fee,\r\nor \"blanket tax,\" by the University in 1912, which admitted the student\r\nto all athletic events and was paid with the other University fees, and\r\nwith the growing influence of the Board in Control of Athletics, the\r\ncharacter of the Athletic Association gradually changed. However, the\r\norganization still continues to elect its officers and Board of\r\nDirectors, who elect the three student representatives on the Board in\r\nControl from a list of six nominated by the Board. The student managers\r\nof the athletic teams are now appointed by the coach, the captain of the\r\nteam and the retiring manager. Since 1899 the general direction of the\r\naffairs of the Athletic Association has been in the hands of two men,\r\nCharles Baird, '95, who was appointed Graduate Director of Athletics in\r\nthat year, and Phillip G. Bartelme, a former member of the class of '99,\r\nwho succeeded him in 1909, and now holds the title of Director of\r\nOutdoor Athletics.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at organized collegiate sport in the University dates\r\nfrom the time of the Civil War, for it was in 1863 that baseball was\r\nfirst introduced among the students. Two men are given the credit, John\r\nM. Hinchman, '62-'65, who had been a member of the Detroit Club, and\r\nE.L. Grant, '66, who as a freshman became interested in accounts of the\r\ngame as it was being played by a few clubs in and around New York. With\r\nsome of his friends he wrote for information in the spring of 1863, and\r\nlater ordered bases, balls and clubs, and proceeded to lay out a diamond\r\non the northeast corner of the Campus which was afterward maintained by\r\nthe University.\r\n\r\nBaseball in those days differed considerably from the present game; the\r\npitcher was restricted to an underhand delivery; the catch of a foul\r\nbound meant an \"out\"; strikes were not called; and bases on balls were\r\nunknown; while owing to the straight-arm pitching, the batting was much\r\nheavier and the scores larger. There was not much of a team in 1863, but\r\nthe effort resulted in the organization of the first University Baseball\r\nClub in the spring of 1864, with Hinchman, who was the catcher, as\r\npresident and captain. The members of the team had no uniforms and paid\r\ntheir own expenses, as no admission was charged for the games. While the\r\nopposing teams and the scores are not on record, the nine was judged\r\nhighly successful and was very popular. In the fall of 1865 the team\r\ndefeated Jackson, Ypsilanti, and Dexter and was in turn defeated by a\r\nteam from Lodi Township near Ann Arbor. General interest in the game was\r\nevidently spreading rapidly.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the Club was groomed for the championship of the State; student\r\nsubscriptions were solicited; class nines were formed to give them\r\nsufficient practice, and the dignity of white uniforms was at last\r\nattained. Finally the team, accompanied by seventy supporters,--it was\r\nlong before the day of \"rooters,\"--traveled to Detroit and met the\r\nDetroit Champions. The game lasted three hours and a half, included six\r\nhome runs, and was won by the University with the wholly satisfactory\r\nscore of 70 to 18, Detroit being unable to hit Blackburn the University\r\npitcher sufficiently, though, judged by modern standards, his record was\r\nnot exactly a \"shut-out.\" A return game, however, played in the fall\r\nresulted in the defeat of the University 36 to 20, while the final game\r\nof the series, a year later, ran to eleven innings with the University\r\nfinally winning 26 to 24. Soon after this the Detroit team disbanded and\r\nfor some years baseball languished in the University; partly because of\r\nthe lack of opponents for so redoubtable a nine, and partly because the\r\nfirst enthusiasm for the game had waned. Interest revived somewhat in\r\n1873, but aside from inter-class games the only available opponents were\r\nmostly professional clubs from the neighboring towns, who were\r\nordinarily outclassed by the college men. With the abolition of the old\r\nstraight-arm pitching in 1875 and the calling of strikes established,\r\nthe extravagant scores began to be materially reduced.\r\n\r\nMichigan's first inter-collegiate baseball game was with Wisconsin on\r\nMay 20, 1882. It was played at Ann Arbor and resulted in a victory 20 to\r\n8. This game came as a result of the formation of an Inter-collegiate\r\nBaseball League, composed of Michigan, Wisconsin, Northwestern and\r\nRacine, in which the Varsity easily won the championship. Unsatisfactory\r\narrangements for the traveling expenses of the team, however, caused\r\nMichigan to withdraw from the League the next year and the nine was\r\nforced once more to fall back upon the professional and\r\nsemi-professional teams in neighboring cities. Oberlin appeared upon the\r\nschedule in 1886 and Michigan Agricultural College twice defeated the\r\nVarsity the following year. But if these years saw no remarkable\r\nschedules, the team was, nevertheless, steadily improving. The fielding\r\naverage of the '88 team was .908; and though less can be said of the\r\nbatting, two members, McDonnell, '88, and McMillan, '86-'89, had\r\naverages of .448 and .406 respectively. The _Chronicle_ also was\r\njubilant over the financial success of the '88 season which left a\r\nsurplus of $50 in the treasury, after \"elegant new suits\" had been\r\npurchased.\r\n\r\nConfidence in the ability of the team led to the first Eastern trip in\r\n1890, which resulted in a close and exciting 2 to 1 victory over Cornell\r\nat Ithaca, May 16. From this time on Cornell and other Eastern colleges\r\nappeared with fair regularity in the schedule. Games with Harvard and\r\nYale were arranged in 1891, and every candidate was pledged to strict\r\ntraining after February first under Peter Conway, a famous National\r\nLeague pitcher. The trip resulted in a creditable record; and although\r\nthe game with Yale was lost 2 to 0, only three hits were scored off the\r\npitcher, Codd, '91, a record for the Varsity almost as welcome as a\r\nvictory. The game with Harvard, won 4 to 3, was peculiarly satisfying to\r\nthe tired team, which had already played six games, and had had, in the\r\nwords of Captain Codd, \"as hard a course of training as any University\r\nteam had, up to that time, ever undergone.... We had given our Eastern\r\nantagonists a pretty good 'practice game,'\" (the Harvard manager's\r\nterm). Conditions were reversed the following year when Yale was\r\ndefeated 3 to 2, but Harvard won 4 to 2. Michigan returned to her\r\nWestern rivals in 1893 and was almost uniformly successful for several\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAn Eastern trip in 1894 was less fortunate, for it resulted in an\r\nunbroken series of defeats from Vermont, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton,\r\nand Cornell. The spell with Cornell was broken, however, in 1895, when\r\nMichigan won a decided victory 11 to 0, at Detroit, and had some\r\nrevenge for previous defeats. E.C. Shields, '94, '96_l_, center field\r\nand captain of the team that year, has described the winning of this\r\ngame as the \"most satisfactory moment\" of his athletic career; the team\r\nwas the best Michigan had ever had, and the game after the first few\r\ninnings became a successful struggle on the part of the pitcher, Sexton,\r\n'98_m_, and his team-mates to make it a \"shut-out.\" Since that day\r\nMichigan has more than broken even in her games with Cornell.\r\n\r\nBaseball at this time was genuinely popular; all of the classes in the\r\nLiterary Department as well as many in the professional schools had\r\ntheir own teams, which not only gave the Varsity good practice but\r\nplayed in a league among themselves, while the fraternities also had a\r\nleague of some years' standing. This popularity of the national game was\r\nsoon to pass, however, with the increasing vogue of football, and it has\r\nnever regained the pre-eminent place it held in student favor during the\r\nperiod which ended in 1900, though, it has always had many enthusiastic\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nThe year '99 saw an especially strong team, which not only was\r\nsuccessful in the West but at least divided honors on the first Eastern\r\ntrip of some years. Particularly spectacular was the final game with\r\nIllinois which won the championship. Michigan had already won two out of\r\nthree games, but with a victory in the last of the series Illinois saw a\r\nchance to claim the Western honors. In the sixth inning Illinois had men\r\non second and third and no one out. Guy Miller, '98, '00_l_, otherwise\r\nknown as \"Sox,\" was put in as pitcher, and though he had won a hard game\r\nthe day before, he struck out the next two batters. The last man was put\r\nout easily, and Miller held the rest of the game safely, with a final\r\nscore of 4 to 2.\r\n\r\nTwo fairly successful years followed, marked, however, by a uniformly\r\ndisastrous Eastern trip in 1901. Then followed in 1902 \"the most\r\nunsuccessful baseball season in years,\" though the end came with a\r\nvictory over Cornell, 7 to 4, largely through the efforts of Michigan's\r\ngreatest all-round athlete, Neil Snow, '02, in the last contest of his\r\nathletic career. He was responsible for six of the seven runs, bringing\r\nin three men with one three-base hit, while he himself managed to score\r\non a poor throw.\r\n\r\nA final defeat from Illinois the following year just missed the\r\nchampionship of the West for Michigan. It is worthy of mention that it\r\nwas at this game, on which many undergraduate hopes were centered, that\r\nthe custom of singing \"The Yellow and the Blue\" in defeat as well as in\r\nvictory was inaugurated. The Western championship rested with Michigan\r\nin 1905 and again in 1906, but this was destined to be the last time for\r\nmany years. Much of the success of these two teams was due to Frank\r\nSanger, '07_l_, who was considered the best college pitcher in the West.\r\n\r\nWith 1907 begins another story. Michigan was now out of the Conference\r\nand there began a progressive decline in interest in baseball. Many\r\nsmall colleges soon appeared on the schedules, and in 1908 the South\r\nbegan to figure prominently in the earlier season games. A few games\r\nwith Eastern colleges relieved the monotony, but the results were far\r\nfrom being always satisfactory. Two interesting games with the Japanese\r\nstudents of Keio University ended the season of 1911. While the\r\nUniversity won both games with scores of 20 to 5 and 3 to 1, they\r\ndemonstrated how apt the Oriental has been in picking up the fine points\r\nof the great American game. Some amends for an unsuccessful season were\r\nmade on June 26, 1912 by a thrilling 2 to 1 victory over Pennsylvania\r\nbefore the thousands of guests and alumni who had gathered to celebrate\r\nthe University's Seventy-Fifth Anniversary.\r\n\r\nThe painstaking efforts of Branch Rickey, who had been coach of the team\r\nsince 1910, and later became manager of the St. Louis American League\r\nteam, began to show results in 1913. The following year Michigan, in\r\nspite of no significant Western games, had some justification for\r\nclaiming the national championship through victories in two series of\r\ngames with Cornell and Pennsylvania, the acknowledged leaders of the\r\nEast. This record was due in no small part to the prowess of one player,\r\nGeorge Sisler, '15_e_, who, from his first season in 1913, showed the\r\nextraordinary ability that made him not only Michigan's greatest\r\nbaseball player but one of the best all-round players in the history of\r\nthe game. While in the University he alternated as pitcher and left\r\nfielder and was captain of the team in 1914. This was the year Carl\r\nLundgren began his successful career as baseball coach. An unexpected\r\nweakness in critical games and an unfortunate discussion over\r\nprofessionalism were probably the reasons for the poor success in 1915\r\nof what was essentially an unusually competent team, while a nine\r\ncomposed almost entirely of inexperienced players counted heavily\r\nagainst the 1916 record.\r\n\r\nWith the declaration of war in the spring of 1917 all forms of athletics\r\nwere suspended. The value of outdoor sports, as a means of developing\r\nthe physique of the future soldier, as well as the powers of leadership\r\nand co-operation so necessary in military service, was not at first\r\nrecognized, and only after the baseball and track seasons of 1917 were\r\nlong past was a more reasonable attitude toward collegiate athletics\r\ninaugurated as a result of an earnest plea on the part of the\r\nGovernment that, as far as practicable, they be re-established.\r\n\r\nMichigan's return to the Western Conference early in 1918 was marked by\r\nher first undisputed baseball championship since 1905, the team winning\r\nnine out of ten Conference games played. This record was practically\r\nrepeated in 1919, the Varsity winning all but one out of a schedule of\r\nthirteen games, and that one not with a Conference college. The 1920\r\nseason was equally satisfactory.\r\n\r\nFootball was introduced in the University a few years after the\r\nestablishment of baseball. The first record of a game appears to be the\r\nfollowing notice in the _Chronicle_ of a game played on April 23, 1870.\r\n\r\n     The first foot-ball match in the University of late came off on\r\n     Saturday last, between the fresh and sophs. Seven goals, or byes,\r\n     or tallies, or scores, or something--we are not _au fait_ on\r\n     foot-ball phraseology--constituted the game, which was won by the\r\n     freshmen, the sophs coming out second best each time. Foot-ball is\r\n     a new institution on the Campus, but bids fair to be popular, at\r\n     least on cool days.\r\n\r\nThis was not strictly the first appearance of the game, as the sophomore\r\nclass in 1866 had secured a football, and the resulting impromptu\r\ncontests had aroused some patronizing comment in the college paper. But\r\nthis first effort was short-lived, and the sport went \"to a grave too\r\ncold by far.\" That this death was \"greatly exaggerated\" is suggested by\r\nthe paragraph quoted. As a matter of fact football steadily grew in\r\nfavor from that time, although in its earliest years it was by no means\r\nthe game we know now. There seemed to be no hard and fast rules, at\r\nleast not according to the Michigan practice of the early '70's. It was\r\nlargely, or more properly, entirely, a kicking game, with any number up\r\nto thirty on a side. This made it particularly popular as a vehicle for\r\nclass rivalries, and we have record of one game in 1876 in which\r\nforty-two sophomores were defeated by _eighty-two_ freshmen, though the\r\nresult was different when the two sides were equalized in a later\r\ncontest. The number of participants in class games was not always\r\nlimited to eleven players as late as 1889-90. The number of goals\r\nrequisite to win a game also varied, depending upon a previous agreement\r\nof the two sides. The popular attitude toward football, and the status\r\nof athletics in general is amusingly suggested in the following\r\nparagraph which appeared in the _Chronicle_, October 19, 1872:\r\n\r\n     The base-ball ground is well filled on these pleasant afternoons.\r\n     The games of foot-ball, base-ball and cricket are played at the\r\n     same time. It is quite laughable for an outsider to witness the\r\n     consternation of the players of the two more scientific games when\r\n     the mob engaged in the other sport comes towards them.\r\n\r\nBy 1872 all four classes had their teams and the four captains formed a\r\nloose football organization, which became a Football Association the\r\nfollowing year. Modern football, the Rugby game, was introduced in 1876\r\nby Charles M. Gayley, '78, better known to generations of Michigan\r\nstudents as the author of \"The Yellow and the Blue,\" and now Professor\r\nof English in the University of California. No inter-collegiate games\r\nwere played, however, until May 30, 1879, when Michigan defeated Racine\r\nat White Stocking Park, Chicago, 7 to 2, in what was probably the first\r\ninter-collegiate contest in the West; certainly no game had ever\r\nattracted such attention or drew such crowds as this one. I.K. Pond,\r\n'79, in after years to be the architect of the Michigan Union, made a\r\ntouchdown in the first half, and a goal from the field by De Tar; '78,\r\n'80_m_, accounted for the balance of the Varsity's score, while a safety\r\nwas all that was permitted to Racine. In the autumn of the same year\r\nMichigan played a tie game with Toronto at Detroit. Four cars filled\r\nwith students accompanied the team and demonstrated the growing\r\npopularity of the Rugby game. The team fully deserved this support, for\r\nthe Canadian eleven was more experienced and even the _Chronicle_\r\nacknowledged that they excelled in almost every part of the game. The\r\nfollowing fall Michigan won a second game at Toronto, 13 to 0, much to\r\nthe disgust of the Canadians.\r\n\r\nFor some time there had been a growing demand for a series of games with\r\nEastern colleges. As a result Michigan's first invasion of the East came\r\nin the fall of 1881. The outcome was far from discouraging, in view of\r\nthe inexperience of the Michigan eleven and the greater interest in the\r\ngame in the East; for though the Varsity was uniformly defeated, the\r\nscores were by no means overwhelming. The game with Harvard was lost 4\r\nto 0, and those with Yale and Princeton, 11 to 0 and 13 to 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FERRY FIELD\r\nFrom the New Stand, showing the gates and the Club House]\r\n\r\nInter-collegiate football was dormant the following year, but in\r\nNovember, 1883, a second Eastern trip resulted in another clear\r\ndemonstration of the greater advantages the game enjoyed in the seaboard\r\ncolleges. The game with Yale was a decided defeat 46 to 0; but Harvard\r\nbarely avoided a tie with a 3 to 0 score; Wesleyan won 14 to 6, while\r\nthe one victory for the West was over Stevens Institute 5 to 1. The\r\nHarvard game was the greatest disappointment as Michigan, with a much\r\nbetter team than in the previous game, had hoped for victory. All the\r\ncircumstances, however, were unfavorable. The only possible schedule\r\ncalled for a game with Yale the preceding day, and a series of new\r\nrules were flashed upon the team as the only ones under which the\r\nEasterners would play. The game, which was played November 22, was an\r\nexceedingly close one, however, and the first half ended with neither\r\nside scoring, and most of the play in Harvard's territory. A failure to\r\nkick goal following a score by Harvard in the second half still left\r\nhope, though Harvard repeatedly saved her goal by kicking. Finally a\r\nHarvard man ran out of bounds on Michigan's twenty-five yard line and\r\nthe ball was thrown out from that point according to the rules then in\r\nforce. Michigan secured it and by using the one trick play in her\r\nrepertoire, the time-honored fake run, Prettyman, '85, the manager of\r\nthe team, started off with Killilea, '85_l_, as his interference _behind\r\nhim_, as the rules then demanded. The opposing full-back was ready for\r\nthem, but just before the tackle the ball was passed to Killilea, who\r\nwent on for the touch-down while Prettyman went head-on into the Harvard\r\nfull-back, calling \"down\" in accordance with the plan. The Harvard\r\numpire insisted that the ball was \"down\" where Prettyman had been\r\ntackled, and the referee ordered it back to the middle of the field and\r\nthen called the game on account of darkness. The Michigan team arranged\r\nimmediately to stay and play another game the next day. But instead of\r\nplaying, Harvard pleaded faculty interference and paid a $100 forfeit.\r\nAn eleven that could play Yale one day, Harvard the next, and then be\r\nready for a third game, made a profound impression, however, and created\r\ngreat respect for Western grit and sportsmanship.\r\n\r\nAfter this venture into the lime-light there came several years of\r\ncomparatively minor games, due largely to the fact that few teams were\r\navailable as competitors. For many years Albion had a regular place on\r\nthe schedule and was regularly defeated, save in 1891, when it won for\r\nthe first and last time. The Chicago University Club, the Windsor Club,\r\nthe Peninsular Club of Detroit, and Notre Dame were the principal\r\nopponents until the first game with Cornell in 1889. The result of this\r\ncontest, 56 to 0 in favor of Cornell, was discouraging, but in a second\r\ngame the following year the Varsity managed to score five points against\r\nCornell's twenty. This score came as the result of a long field goal by\r\nJames Duffy, '92_l_, who three years previously had won the first\r\nVarsity medal for breaking an inter-collegiate record, with a drop-kick\r\nof 168 feet 7-1/2 inches, surpassing Yale's previous record of 157 feet,\r\nfive times before he was satisfied.\r\n\r\nA new era in the history of football at Michigan began in 1891, when\r\nwith a fair schedule and an experienced coach, Frank Crawford (Yale,\r\n'91), '93_l_, the systematic development of a team began; though it was\r\nnot until several years later that football assumed the undisputed\r\nsupremacy it now holds as a college sport. Cornell won twice that year\r\nand gave Michigan her first experience with \"real interference and fast\r\nplay.\" Michigan took her first Western trip the following year. The team\r\nwas coached by Frank Barbour, a classmate of Crawford's at Yale, and for\r\nthe first time played a complete schedule with the leading universities\r\nof the West, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Northwestern, and Chicago, with\r\nvarying success. The Varsity lost most of her principal games in 1893,\r\nMinnesota winning for the last time in twenty-seven years, though a\r\nfinal victory over Chicago, 18 to 10, was some compensation for the\r\nearlier defeats.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1894 saw the beginning of a long series of remarkably\r\nsuccessful seasons, which lasted with one or two partial relapses until\r\n1906. These twelve years were not only Michigan's \"golden age\" of\r\nfootball, as far as the game itself is concerned, but also one of the\r\nlongest series of almost uniformly successful seasons in the history of\r\nany of the larger American Universities. It is true that a decisive\r\ndefeat from Cornell, 22 to 0, marred the early season in 1894, but a\r\nsecond game, 12 to 4, redeemed the record. This was Michigan's first\r\nvictory over a rival of long standing. The team was a formidable one,\r\nequally strong on offense and defense, and included such well-known\r\nnames in Michigan's football annals as H.M. (\"Mort\") Senter, '90-'95,\r\n_m_'95-97, end; Gustave H. (\"Dutch\") Ferbert, '97, end in '94 and later\r\nhalf-back; G.R.F. (\"Count\") Villa, 96_l_, tackle; F.W. (\"Pa\") Henninger,\r\n'97, guard; and \"Jimmy\" Baird, '96, quarter-back. W.L. McCauley,\r\nPrinceton, '94, who had entered the Medical School, proved his ability\r\nas a coach during this and the two succeeding seasons.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this time there had been little supervision of athletics on\r\nthe part of the Faculty, and no attention was paid to the composition of\r\nthe teams or the academic standing of the players. When the general\r\nAthletic Association was organized in 1891, an Advisory Board of three\r\nnon-resident alumni and four Faculty members was established, though at\r\nfirst it had slight influence. The Faculty members were becoming\r\nimpressed, however, with the significance of the growing interest in\r\nathletics all over the country and realized the necessity of some form\r\nof effective supervision.\r\n\r\nUp to this time there had been no real distinction in the West between\r\nprofessional and amateur. The question came home to Michigan as the\r\nresult of a disclosure that two men on the 1893 track team were\r\nsub-freshmen, not yet in college, although they entered the following\r\nfall. The Athletic Board promptly requested the resignation of the\r\ncaptain of the team and published the facts. The Faculty was also\r\naroused. The result was the organization in 1894 of the Board in Control\r\nof Athletics, which ordinarily has had the final word in the\r\nadministration of athletic affairs since that time. It is at present\r\ncomposed of four Faculty representatives, elected by the University\r\nSenate, three alumni, appointed by the Regents, three students appointed\r\nby the Directors of the Athletic Association, and the Director of\r\nOutdoor Athletics.\r\n\r\nThe year 1894, therefore, aside from the beginnings of a real football\r\nteam, was important also because it saw the awakening of the Faculty to\r\nits responsibility in athletic affairs, and a corresponding growth in\r\nthe whole University body of higher ideals of inter-collegiate sport,\r\nwith the University \"started fairly and squarely on the road to athletic\r\ncleanliness.\" The movement thus inaugurated resulted in the\r\nestablishment of the Western Inter-collegiate Conference on February 8,\r\n1896. This is a body composed of representatives from the athletic\r\nboards of seven (later ten) leading mid-western Universities, which has\r\naimed from the first, not only to regulate and standardize the\r\nconditions of all forms of inter-collegiate athletic competition but\r\nalso to maintain a high ideal of amateurism in college sports. The\r\nformation of this body, which soon came to be the most powerful\r\ninfluence in the West for clean athletics, was due in no small part to\r\nPresident Angell, who was instrumental in calling the first meeting, as\r\nwell as to Dr. C.B.G. de Nancrede and Professor Albert H. Pattengill,\r\nthe Michigan representatives at that first meeting. Professor\r\nPattengill's interest in outdoor sports was lifelong. His was the\r\nmoving spirit in the Conference through many years; and to him, more\r\nthan to any other, Michigan owes, not only the present effective\r\norganization of athletics, but the securing of Ferry Field and its\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nThe records of the football teams of 1895 and 1896 were quite\r\noverwhelming for those days, 266 points to their opponents' 14 in 1895\r\nand 262 points to 11 the next season. The only disappointments were a 4\r\nto 0 defeat from Harvard in 1895 and a 7 to 6 victory for Chicago in\r\n1896. A season of uninterrupted victories in 1897 was again cut short by\r\na defeat from Chicago 21 to 12 in the last game. Chicago had now come to\r\noccupy the chief place on the schedule and the seeds of that rivalry\r\nwhich was later to prove so unfortunate in Western inter-collegiate\r\naffairs were already being sown.\r\n\r\nAn unbroken series of victories marked the 1898 season, with the\r\nChampionship of the West decided by a thrilling 12 to 11 victory over\r\nChicago. At the end of the first half in this game the score stood 6 to\r\n5,--a touchdown for Michigan and a goal from the field by Chicago's\r\ngreat punter, Herschberger. One of the most spectacular runs in\r\nMichigan's football history came in the early part of the second half\r\nwhen C.H. Widman, a freshman, broke through between left end and tackle,\r\nran down the field sixty yards, broke away from the Chicago full-back,\r\nand squirmed across the remaining five yards for a touchdown. Chicago's\r\nsubsequent touchdown made the score a close one but left the\r\nchampionship, the first in three years, with Michigan. The center on\r\nthis team, W.R. Cunningham, '99_m_, was Michigan's first player on an\r\nAll-American Team.\r\n\r\nThis team had been coached by a number of the older players, a system\r\nthat was followed again in 1899, but with no brilliant success. A\r\nchange came in 1900 when Langdon Lea, of Princeton, took charge. He\r\ninstituted some revolutionary changes and insisted on the fundamentals\r\nof the game,--always the weak point of Western football. The season,\r\nhowever, was not a great success, and in the final game with Chicago,\r\nCoach Stagg, with his famous \"whoa-back\" formation, was able to take\r\nadvantage of Michigan's weakness in backing up the tackles, and won with\r\na score of 15 to 16.\r\n\r\nThe record for the following year was very different. Fielding H. Yost,\r\nwho received his football training at the University of West Virginia\r\nand Lafayette, was called to Michigan from Stanford and entered upon his\r\nlong and successful career as Michigan's football coach. Not only has he\r\nproved himself time and again a master of football strategy, but his\r\ninsistence on the highest ideals of sportsmanship has been one of the\r\nstrongest factors in the development of clean athletics at Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe new coach undeniably had good material to work with in his first\r\nteam. Most of the men comprising it had been well trained in the finer\r\npoints of the game by his predecessor and included such exceptional\r\nplayers as Captain Hugh White, '02_l_, tackle; Curtis Redden, '03_l_,\r\nend; Neil Snow, '02, full-back; Harrison S. (\"Boss\") Weeks, '02_l_,\r\nquarter; and Everett Sweeley, '03, half-back; while to this list were\r\nadded that year Martin Heston, '04_l_, one of the greatest backs in the\r\nhistory of the game; the center, George Gregory, '04_l_; and the old\r\nreliable guard Dan McGugin, '04_l_. This team under Yost's astute and\r\nresourceful direction proved invincible, and became one of the greatest\r\nelevens in the history of football. Whether it could have dealt\r\nsuccessfully with the Eastern champions will always be a question, but\r\nit certainly found little effective opposition in the West; for the\r\nfinal record showed an uninterrupted succession of victories with not a\r\npoint scored against the team. The total tells the story, 550 points to\r\n0; with the University of Buffalo beaten by the extraordinary score of\r\n128 to 0. The final game of the season was played with Stanford at\r\nPasadena, California, on New Year's Day, 1902. The quality of the team\r\nwas shown by the fact that they won by a score of 49 to 0 in spite of\r\nthe fact that they had been in training for four months, and left\r\nMichigan in zero weather to play in what was to them a summer heat. Snow\r\nwas given a place that year on Caspar Whitney's All-American Team, while\r\nWalter Camp selected Snow, Weeks, Heston, and Bruce Shorts, '01_l_\r\n(tackle), for the All-Western team.\r\n\r\nExcept for the fact that the eleven was scored upon twice, once by Case\r\nand once by Minnesota, the record in 1902 was much the same as in 1901,\r\n644 points to their opponents' 12.\r\n\r\nAlthough there were many changes in the team the following year, there\r\nwas a consistent development of team-work, which, combined with Heston's\r\nextraordinary ability in carrying the ball, enabled Michigan to go\r\nthrough the season with only one score against the team, in a tie game\r\nwith Minnesota. The 1904 team, though it was scored upon three times,\r\nwas also uniformly victorious under the leadership of Heston, who was\r\ntwice given a place on Camp's All-American, as well as his All-Time\r\nAll-American team chosen in 1910. The 1905 Championship passed to\r\nChicago, however, though the team was scored upon only by the two points\r\nwhich lost Michigan the final game with Chicago. This defeat came as a\r\nresult of an error in judgment which cost Michigan a safety instead of\r\nthe touch-back that might easily have changed defeat into at least a\r\ntie. The following men composing this team were very generally selected\r\nfor All-Western honors; Thomas S. Hammond, '06_l_, half-back; Joseph S.\r\nCurtis, '07_e_, tackle; and Henry F. Schulte, '07, guard, who were\r\nmembers of the 1903 and 1904 elevens, and Adolph (\"Germany\") Schulz,\r\n_e_'04-09, center. Not a little credit for the record of this team must\r\nalso be given to the captain, Fred S. Norcross, '06_e_, while John C.\r\nGarrels, '07_e_, end, destined to hold a record only second to Niel\r\nSnow, as an all-round athlete, and Walter (\"Octy\") Graham, '08_e_, who\r\nproved extraordinarily active at end and later at guard, in spite of his\r\n215 pounds, first won their \"M's\" as players on the 1905 eleven.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a change had come in Michigan's relations with the other\r\nuniversities composing the Western Inter-collegiate Conference which\r\neventually led to her withdrawal from that body, and brought to an end\r\nfor some twelve years all competition with her natural rivals in the\r\nWest. This action applied to all forms of inter-collegiate sport, but\r\nthe agitation centered almost exclusively about football and may\r\ntherefore be properly mentioned in this place. For some years there had\r\nbeen developing throughout the country a powerful opposition to\r\ninter-collegiate football which began with the introduction of the Rugby\r\ngame. The old-time open game had been replaced by powerful mass-plays,\r\ndangerous to limb and even to life. The conditions under which the \"big\r\ngames\" were played had little reference to wholesome college life, the\r\nessential amateur spirit was fast disappearing, rivalries were becoming\r\nbitter, as was the case between Michigan and Chicago, and in fact the\r\nwhole academic spirit was threatened by the exaggerated emphasis on this\r\none phase of college sport.\r\n\r\nMichigan took the initiative for a reform, through a letter from\r\nPresident Angell, calling for a meeting of representatives of the\r\nleading Western universities in Chicago in January, 1906. All the\r\ninstitutions represented at this meeting were unanimous in the feeling\r\nthat drastic measures were necessary; Wisconsin even asked for the\r\nabandonment of the game for two years. The result was a series of\r\ndemands for fundamental reforms, including the abolition of the training\r\ntable and excessive gate receipts, a modification of the professional\r\ncoaching system, and finally a provision that no freshmen should be\r\nallowed to take part in inter-collegiate contests, and that no student\r\nshould participate more than three seasons.\r\n\r\nThis action was a bomb-shell whose fragments disrupted the student and\r\nalumni bodies of all the Western Conference colleges. Criticism became\r\nintense, but eventually all the nine Conference colleges accepted the\r\nnew rules with certain amendments except Michigan, where a four-year\r\ncontract with Yost made special difficulties. The student body and many\r\nalumni felt aggrieved at a clause in the new rules which made the\r\nthree-year playing rule retroactive, thereby barring out several of the\r\nmost prominent players, including Garrels, after their junior year. They\r\ntherefore demanded that Michigan sever her relations with the West and\r\nseek her future opponents among Eastern universities. Implicit in the\r\nwhole discussion also was the question as to whether the Faculty was to\r\nhave the last word in the control of athletics. This was the fundamental\r\ndemand of the Conference, while the effective opinion at Michigan\r\nfavored a broader control by students, Faculty and alumni, in which the\r\nfinal decision was to rest with the Board of Regents. This view was\r\naccepted by the Regents; changes were made in the organization of the\r\nBoard in Control of Athletics which limited the authority of the\r\nFaculty, and Michigan, by simply refusing to abide by certain of the\r\nrules of the Conference, automatically ceased to be a member in 1908.\r\nFor twelve years, 1906 to 1918, Michigan put to the test the conviction\r\nof the students and many alumni that Michigan could find satisfactory\r\nopponents elsewhere than in the Conference. The result was not\r\nencouraging, for on the whole these were lean years. The football\r\nschedules proved unsatisfactory and though Michigan won her share of\r\ngames, interest and enthusiasm waned correspondingly, while the baseball\r\nand track teams suffered even more. Henceforth the principal opponents\r\nwere Pennsylvania, Cornell, Syracuse, and for a time Vanderbilt.\r\n\r\nDuring the seasons of 1907 and 1908 the team was defeated in the\r\nprincipal games, though one player, Schulz, not only won a place on\r\nCamp's All-American team in 1907, but was also the second Michigan\r\nplayer chosen on his All-Time All-American. Things went a little better\r\nin 1909 and 1910. Pennsylvania was finally defeated and Minnesota, who\r\nappeared temporarily on the schedule for two seasons, as a result of her\r\ndesire to play Michigan and her own dissatisfaction with the Conference,\r\nwas twice defeated and Michigan was able to claim the rather empty honor\r\nof an unacknowledged Championship of the West. Albert Benbrook, '11_e_,\r\nguard on these two teams, was given an All-American position by Walter\r\nCamp.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since 1894 Cornell appeared on the schedule in 1911\r\nand defeated the Varsity, but lost in turn the following year; a record\r\nfor the two years which was just reversed with Pennsylvania. Both teams\r\nwere decisively defeated in 1913 and Pennsylvania again in 1914, but a\r\ngame with Harvard on Soldiers' Field in 1914 resulted in an honorable\r\ndefeat for Michigan with a score of 7 to 0. Though Harvard had not been\r\nparticularly effective up to that time the Michigan team made a strong\r\nimpression, and John Maulbetsch, '17_p_, left-half, was placed on\r\npractically every All-American team as a result of his work in this\r\ngame. The unsatisfactory basis under which Michigan was maintaining her\r\nrelationship with the East was shown, however, by Harvard's\r\nunwillingness to play a return game in Ann Arbor the following year.\r\nThis was perhaps fortunate as events turned out, for Michigan was\r\nunusually weak in 1915 and the 1916 record was not much better, with\r\ndefeats from both Cornell and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nEver since Michigan had taken her stand on the Conference, there had\r\nbeen vigorous discussion, but the unanimous approval necessary for a\r\nreturn was absent. The unfortunate end of the 1917 football season,\r\nhowever, led to a renewal of the discussion. Eventually the Board in\r\nControl passed a resolution giving the Faculty, as represented by the\r\nSenate Council, a veto over the actions of the Board. This was\r\neventually approved by the Regents and the way was open to resume\r\nathletic relationship with the universities of the West in the fall of\r\n1917.\r\n\r\nThough the ban on inter-collegiate athletics which followed the\r\ndeclaration of war in April, 1917, had been raised before the 1917\r\nfootball season at the urgent plea of the War Department, the team was\r\nseriously weakened by the enlistment of many of its best players. This\r\nhappened everywhere, however, and Michigan came through the schedule\r\nwith fair success, though defeated by Northwestern in the one Conference\r\ngame of that year. But in 1918 war-time conditions were felt more\r\nseverely, particularly in the general disorganization incident to the\r\nS.A.T.C. regime, while the ravages of the influenza epidemic multiplied\r\nthe difficulties. Nevertheless Michigan managed to survive the season\r\nnot only undefeated but with some claims to the Western Championship.\r\nThe record in 1919 was very different, however, with defeats in all the\r\nConference games played save with Northwestern, a disgrace which was at\r\nleast partially retrieved by the 1920 eleven, which lost a hard-fought\r\nbattle with Illinois by the honorable score of 6 to 7 and won from\r\nChicago, 14 to 0, and Minnesota, 3 to 0.\r\n\r\nThough informal running, jumping, and hurdling matches as well as\r\nwrestling and boxing always had a certain degree of popularity among the\r\nstudents, track athletics, as a form of inter-collegiate sport, was not\r\norganized until football and baseball had been recognized for some time.\r\nA University Athletic Club was organized in 1874, with the captains of\r\nthe running and jumping squads among the officers, though no public\r\ncontests were held, apparently, until 1876 when the first \"athletic\r\ntournament\" took place on the Fair Grounds. This was followed in June,\r\n1879, by the first Field Day, with the 100-yard and 220-yard dashes,\r\nstanding long jump, baseball throw, ten-mile walk, and a fencing contest\r\namong the principal events. The next year saw two such tournaments,\r\nunder the auspices of the Football and Baseball Associations\r\nrespectively. The merchants of Ann Arbor gave prizes for these contests,\r\nsome contributing medals, while one firm gave two boxes of cigars and\r\nanother \"the best hat in the store.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1884 the program became very elaborate, some twenty events were\r\nscheduled with records of one hour and 51 minutes for the ten-mile walk,\r\n26-1/2 minutes for the three-mile walk, and 2.33 for the half-mile run.\r\nSuch events as a standing jump backwards, a three-legged race, and\r\npassing the football and punting also found place on the programme,\r\nwhich was concluded by a Rugby match. Particular interest was taken at\r\nthis time in running, and it is told by one of the members of the\r\nfootball team that almost defeated Harvard in 1883 that an impromptu\r\nrace at Buffalo, while they were waiting for a train, went a long way\r\ntoward defraying the expenses of some of the men, who were paying their\r\nown way. The outstanding track athlete of the day was Fred M. Bonine,\r\n'86_m_, whose record in sprints led Michigan to enter the\r\nInter-collegiate Athletic Association, where he won the 100-yard dash in\r\n10-3/4 seconds at New York in 1885. This was Michigan's first and last\r\neffort for some years; and track athletics had a fluctuating career\r\nuntil the Northwestern Inter-collegiate Athletic Association, composed\r\nof Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Northwestern, was organized in\r\n1893. The first Field Day of this organization was held June 3, 1893,\r\nwith Michigan the winner with 52 points against 45 for Wisconsin, her\r\nclosest competitor. Michigan did not again win first honors until 1898,\r\nand then, after taking third place in 1899, she held the Championship\r\nbanner for five successive seasons, 1900 to 1904, and once more in 1906.\r\nDuring this period the Varsity was also very generally winning dual\r\nmeets with Cornell, Wisconsin, and Illinois, though she lost to Chicago\r\nin 1901 and 1902. Michigan also won the four-mile relay race at the\r\nPennsylvania Relay Meet for six successive years, 1903 to 1908, and made\r\nthe best record of any university entered in the track events scheduled\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nAfter 1906 the Eastern Inter-collegiate Meet necessarily came to hold\r\nfirst place in the schedule, and here also Michigan always made a\r\ncreditable record though never succeeding in taking first place. The\r\nteam returned in 1907 with second honors, and then held third place for\r\nfive successive years, 1910 to 1914, with Pennsylvania, Yale, and\r\nCornell usually leading in different years. The Varsity fell behind,\r\nhowever, in 1915 and 1916. Owing to war-time conditions no meets were\r\nheld in 1917, but Michigan's return to the Conference fold was marked by\r\ntwo successive Western Championships in 1918 and 1919.\r\n\r\nThis long and honorable record in field sports has been made possible by\r\nconsistent encouragement of well-rounded teams in which all branches\r\nwere carefully developed, through the extraordinary ability of Keene\r\nFitzpatrick, perhaps the greatest athletic trainer and track coach in\r\nthe country. His acceptance of a similar position at Princeton in 1911\r\nwas a great loss to Michigan, where he had served for sixteen years.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1897 Michigan held several Western records. The first of\r\nMichigan's all-round athletes was John F. McLean, '00, who not only won\r\nregularly the hurdles and broad jump, equaling or bettering the Western\r\nrecords, but was also half-back on the football team. Charles Dvorak,\r\n'01, '04_l_, also held the Western record in the pole vault, while\r\nArchie Hahn, '04_l_, speedily developed into one of the country's\r\ngreatest sprinters, equaling several times the world's record in the\r\n100-yard dash of 9-4/5 seconds, which still stands. He returned to the\r\nUniversity in 1920 as trainer of the various athletic teams. Neil Snow\r\nalso completed in 1902 his remarkable record of eleven out of a possible\r\ntwelve \"M's\" open to him, by tying with another Michigan man, Barrett,\r\nin the high jump at the Conference Meet, and taking second in the\r\nshotput. Nelson A. Kellogg, '04, came decidedly to the fore in 1901 in\r\nthe long-distance runs, and ended his college career with a record of\r\n9.57-1/2 in the two-mile.\r\n\r\nThe organization of a Cross Country Club in 1901 was directly\r\nresponsible for the long list of relay victories at Philadelphia. The\r\n1905 team, composed of H.P. Ramey, '07_e_; H.L. Coe, '08_e_; I.K. Stone,\r\n'05; and Floyd A. Rowe, '08_e_, set the world's record for the four-mile\r\nand lowered it again in 1906 to 18 minutes 10-2/5 seconds, while the\r\nindividual members of this team were almost invariably to be counted on\r\nas point winners in every meet.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Garrels, '07_e_, is also to be reckoned among the great\r\nall-round athletes; not only was he one of the best men on the football\r\nteam but he was a consistent winner in all the track meets, taking first\r\nin both hurdles and second in the shotput at the Eastern\r\nInter-collegiate in 1907. Among more ephemeral stars of this period was\r\nRalph Rose, who remained in college just long enough to set the record\r\nin 1904 for the hammer throw at 158 feet 3 inches and for the shotput at\r\n47 feet 3 inches. The records of two men, Ralph Craig, '11, and Joseph\r\nHorner, '11, were the striking features of the next few seasons, Craig\r\nwinning the two dashes in the Eastern Inter-collegiate in 1911, equaling\r\nthe record in both, while Horner won first in the discus, second in the\r\nshotput, hammer throw and broad jump, and third in the high jump. Harold\r\nL. Smith, '16, also won the two dashes in 1915 and took a first and a\r\nsecond the following year, almost equaling Craig's record.\r\n\r\nMichigan's two Conference Championships in 1918 and 1919 were assured by\r\nthe extraordinary ability of Carl Johnson, '20, who took three firsts in\r\n1918 and four in 1919, breaking his own record with a broad jump of 24\r\nfeet 1 inch, setting a new record for the high jump of 6 feet 2-1/4\r\ninches and winning both hurdles, thus gaining 20 of Michigan's 41-1/2\r\npoints, a performance never equaled in a major inter-collegiate contest.\r\n\r\nThe particular favor with which football, baseball, and track athletics\r\nhave always been regarded has not prevented a healthy interest in other\r\nsports. Though cricket and wicket died somewhere about 1872, for the\r\n_Chronicle_ remarked in 1875 that not \"even the ghost of a cricket bat\"\r\nhad been seen for two years, and football \"was in its decline,\" baseball\r\nwas exceedingly popular and a general interest in boating was developing\r\nwhich promised to \"equal if not supplant it in popular favor.\" Shells\r\nwere purchased, entertainments for the new Boating Association were\r\ngiven, and for a time the new sport flourished. But the nautical\r\nresources of the Huron and Whitmore Lake were all too slender and after\r\na few years the enthusiasm died, though occasionally talk of a Varsity\r\ncrew springs up.\r\n\r\nTennis came into vogue about 1880. An Association was established as\r\nearly as 1883 and we have it, once more on the _Chronicle's_ carefully\r\nqualified authority, that \"athletics in general have given way to lawn\r\ntennis to a certain extent.\" The Tennis Association was merged, with the\r\nother separate athletic bodies, into the general Athletic Association in\r\n1890, and by 1897 when Michigan first participated in the Western\r\nInter-collegiate tennis matches, the members of the team were awarded\r\nthe Varsity letter. Henry T. Danforth, '03; H.P. Wherry, '03; R.G. St.\r\nJohn, '06_l_, and Reuben G. Hunt, '06_l_, were members of the four teams\r\nwhich led the West in the years from 1901 to 1904, the last championship\r\nuntil 1919, when Walter Wesbrook, '21, captured the singles, and with\r\nNicholas Bartz, Jr., '20, the doubles at Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe return to the Conference also gave a great impetus to the\r\ndevelopment of basket ball as a major sport. Though Michigan's first\r\nteams have not been remarkably successful, the players are now awarded\r\nthe Varsity \"M,\" and interest in the contests is growing rapidly, partly\r\nbecause the game itself is fast and exciting, demanding even greater\r\nquickness and stamina than football, and partly because the season fills\r\nin the interval between the end of the football and the opening of the\r\nbaseball and track seasons in the spring. A swimming team has also been\r\norganized under a competent coach, but it is probable that no great\r\nprogress will be made until the completion of the tanks in the Union and\r\nthe Gymnasium.\r\n\r\nThe women of the University have not been far behind the men in the\r\ndevelopment of athletics. Not only have they always been loyal\r\nsupporters of the University in inter-collegiate contests, but they have\r\ntheir own organized athletic interests which have been no small factor\r\nin the development of the distinctive life of the women in the\r\nUniversity. This has come largely through Barbour Gymnasium, completed\r\nin 1897, and the Palmer Athletic Field for women, which was purchased\r\nsome twelve years later.\r\n\r\nThe Gymnasium, as its name implies, was largely made possible through a\r\ngift of property in Detroit valued at $25,000, by the Hon. Levi L.\r\nBarbour, '63, '65_l_, of Detroit, Regent of the University from 1892 to\r\n1898, and from 1902 to 1907. The building eventually cost $41,341.76,\r\nand includes not only the gymnasium proper, 100 by 90 feet, completely\r\nequipped, but also two large parlors and a series of offices, the\r\nheadquarters of the Women's League, as well as a small auditorium and\r\nstage above, seating about 600 persons, named in honor of the\r\nPresident's wife \"Sarah Caswell Angell Hall.\" Palmer Field was made\r\npossible through two gifts, the first of $1,500 from the Hon. Peter\r\nWhite, Regent from 1904 to 1908, and the second of $3,000 from\r\nex-Senator T.W. Palmer, '49, of Detroit. It comprises a rolling six-acre\r\ntract, just south of the Observatory, and therefore within easy walking\r\ndistance of the Gymnasium.\r\n\r\nThese gifts not only ensured systematic physical training for University\r\nwomen, but also quickly led to a broader interest in sports for women,\r\nas is shown by the pictures of three women's basket-ball teams in the\r\n1903 _Michiganensian_. Since that time there has been a continuous and\r\nconsistent development under competent instruction, with special\r\nemphasis placed on basket ball and such outdoor sports as cross-country\r\nwalking, hockey, baseball, tennis, swimming, and archery, all of which\r\nare supported by a Women's Athletic Association. During the war also a\r\ndrill company was organized under officers of the S.A.T.C.\r\n\r\nIn closing this review of the development of athletics in the University\r\nit may not be amiss to emphasize the fact that the present status of\r\ncollegiate sport is not without its inconsistencies and dangers. There\r\nis real peril for _mens sana_ in an overdeveloped _corpore sano_. The\r\ngeneral and healthy interest in all forms of outdoor sport of earlier\r\ndays has been all but lost in this era of specialization. Nowadays the\r\nVarsity team too often is far from being the apex of a pyramid whose\r\nfoundations lie in a widely distributed and wholesome interest in sports\r\nfor their own sake. Too often we have the spectacle of high-school\r\nstudents coming to our universities with their careers all made for\r\nthem, because of their ability in athletics, bringing with them a spirit\r\nof professionalism utterly foreign to university ideals. And yet all\r\nthis has come as a natural result of the heritage of the American\r\ncollege student, of enterprise, resourcefulness, and love of outdoor\r\nlife and sports.\r\n\r\nThe ideal, of course, is a general participation of all students in some\r\nform of outdoor games, and toward this those who have the best interest\r\nof inter-collegiate athletics at heart are working. A Department of\r\nIntramural Athletics has been established for some time, which seeks to\r\ndevelop a general interest in all kinds of sport;--tennis, for which\r\nFerry Field is admirably equipped with eighteen courts, boxing,\r\ngymnastics, swimming, cross-country running, hockey, indoor baseball and\r\nhand-ball, to say nothing of an increasing emphasis on class and\r\nfraternity football, base-ball, and basket-ball teams.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty which faces those who seek to develop this programme to\r\nits utmost lies in the attitude of many students and alumni, whose sole\r\ninterest in the University is to see that she maintains winning teams.\r\nThey fail to see that there is more in the annual \"big game\" than nine\r\nor eleven supreme athletes brought together to \"represent\" the\r\nUniversity. Fortunately there are many more who view the whole question\r\nin its proper perspective, men who are no less thrilled by the\r\ncontagious enthusiasm of the annual big games, and who recognize them as\r\nan inevitable and not undesirable factor in our college life, but who\r\nseek to bring athletics into a sane and wholesome relationship with the\r\nacademic life of our universities. That is the principal consideration\r\nwhich underlies all the discussions which have arisen in the past and\r\nwhich are inevitable in the future,--as long as American youth, on the\r\none hand, maintains its vigorous and enterprising spirit, and our\r\nuniversities, on the other hand, insist on their prerogative as\r\ninstitutions where fundamentally the things of the spirit must rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTOWN AND CAMPUS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a happy stroke of fortune that fixed Ann Arbor as the location of\r\nthe University of Michigan. A literal interpretation of history may\r\nsuggest that politics and speculation had their share in the selection\r\nof the site, but these factors might have operated quite as easily in\r\nfavor of some other Michigan village. The fact remains that Ann Arbor\r\nwas chosen. This assured to the University an individuality and an\r\nopportunity for self-realization that might have been lost if a town\r\ndestined to a more rapid expansion had been selected. It has given\r\nMichigan a special character among most of the larger American\r\nuniversities and has had a vital influence on the development of the\r\ninstitution, which has grown proportionately far more than the town. The\r\nresult has been that Ann Arbor has become one of the most attractive\r\nacademic centers in the country, with a distinctive charm in her homes\r\nand shady streets, that strikes the visitor no less than the beauty of\r\nits location and the dignity of many of its public buildings.\r\n\r\nAnn Arbor lies in the rolling country of Southern Michigan, thirty-eight\r\nmiles west of Detroit, in the quietly picturesque valley of the Huron\r\nRiver. The University and a good part of the present town lie upon the\r\ntop and slopes of a gentle hill which falls away to the valley levels on\r\nall sides except toward the northeast. From this situation arises one of\r\nthe characteristic features of Ann Arbor; the ever-present glimpses of\r\ndistant hills covered with rolling farm lands and woodlots, toward\r\nwhich almost any of the longer streets lead the eye.\r\n\r\nAt the time the University was established the flow of immigration from\r\nthe East was at high tide. Ann Arbor had already become one of the\r\nprogressive and settled communities of the new State; but farther to the\r\nWest other districts were constantly being opened and towards them a\r\nsteady stream of settlers pressed on. One of the early inhabitants of\r\nAnn Arbor has given us a picture from his boyhood memories, of the long\r\nline of wagons filled with household goods and drawn by horses and oxen,\r\nwhich sometimes stretched along the pike as far as the eye could reach.\r\nThe men who drove these wagons and the women who rode above with the\r\nyoungest of their little families were not adventurers; they were\r\nessentially home-seekers. Their strong fiber was shown by their energy\r\nand courage in seeking thus to better their condition in this new\r\ncountry, which at last had in prospect means of communication with the\r\nseaboard states through the Erie Canal and the railroads soon to be\r\nbuilt. It was settlers with this stuff in them who gave to the\r\nUniversity of Michigan the support that spelled success instead of the\r\nfailure which had attended many similar efforts.\r\n\r\nThe very name, Ann Arbor, recalls an idyll of pioneer life. It sketches\r\nin a picture that is no doubt more charming than the bitter mid-winter\r\nreality faced by the first two families, whose tents were pitched in a\r\nburr-oak grove beside a little stream flowing toward the nearby Huron.\r\nJohn Allen of this party, a vigorous young Virginian, was the driving\r\nforce which first turned the tide of settlement toward Ann Arbor. By\r\nchance, on his way West, he met E.W. Rumsey and his wife in Cleveland\r\nand induced them to come with him to Michigan. They drove overland and\r\narrived at the site of their future home some time in February, 1824. A\r\ntent and sled box set over poles with blankets for sides formed the\r\nfirst dwelling, and here some months later Allen welcomed his wife,\r\nwhose name was Ann. Mrs. Rumsey's name also happened to be the same, and\r\nwhen in the spring the grape vines spread their leaves over the\r\nneighboring trees, these first settlers found a little natural arbor,\r\nwhich they called, doubtless at first in jest, \"Ann's Arbor.\" The name\r\npersisted, however, and it was formally adopted by general acclamation\r\nat a celebration held on the fourth of July, 1825, when some three\r\nhundred persons sat down to a dinner at Rumsey's coffee-house. So far\r\nhad civilization progressed in a little over a year. By that time there\r\nwere nine log houses in the little settlement, which had already begun\r\nto take its place as one of the way-stations in the general tide of\r\nwestward travel. For some time, however, communication with Detroit was\r\ndifficult, and it was not until two years before the University was\r\nopened that the long-awaited railroad actually reached Ann Arbor.\r\nTherefore, for many years the little settlement had to be largely\r\nself-supporting. Such water power as the Huron could furnish was quickly\r\ndeveloped; sawmills, gristmills, and a little later, woolen mills arose\r\nat favorable sites, the ruins of which are still to be seen where the\r\nrelics of the dams now serve as hazards for the venturesome paddler.\r\n\r\nThe first tendency of the inhabitants was to settle on the rise above\r\nthe little stream; known as Allen's Creek, which furnished the water\r\nsupply for the earliest pioneers. This rivulet, practically hidden\r\nnowadays, runs through the city on a course roughly parallel with the\r\nAnn Arbor Railroad tracks. The site of the burr-oak grove and the\r\noriginal encampment was almost certainly on the hillside on the south\r\nside of Huron Street, a block or so west of Main Street. This was\r\nreported to be an old dancing ground of the Pottawatomies, and an Indian\r\ntrail used to run to the Huron along the stream. Rumsey built a log\r\ncabin on this spot immediately and established in it a resting-place for\r\ntravelers, known far and wide as the Washtenaw Coffee House. The second\r\nbuilding was erected by Allen on higher ground at what is now the corner\r\nof Huron and Main streets. It was painted a bright red and the place for\r\nsome time went by the name of \"Bloody Corners.\" At one time the two\r\napartments of the little log house held fourteen men and twenty-one\r\nwomen and children, divided into family groups by the simple expedient\r\nof hanging blankets. In what seems now an incredibly short time life was\r\nmoving in organized channels. A store was opened in September, and\r\nothers soon followed; more buildings were erected; a physician or two\r\nswelled the population; in a little over two years a county court was\r\nestablished; and finally, in 1833, the village was incorporated.\r\n\r\nFor many years the little town was divided into two separate districts\r\nby the Huron River, and a determined effort arose to make the section on\r\nthe north side the main business and residential quarter. This was not\r\nto be; though the old business blocks still stand across the Broadway\r\nbridge, and many of the finer homes of that period, now falling into\r\ndecay, remain on the hills along the turnpikes to Plymouth and Pontiac.\r\n\r\nIt was probably not until the location of the University was fixed that\r\nthe center of Ann Arbor's population began, very slowly at first, to\r\nturn to the south and east, and mounted the slopes of the hill upon\r\nwhich the University stands. Certain it is that for years the Campus\r\nwas practically in the country, and only gradually did the dwellings of\r\nthe townspeople rise in the neighborhood. Aside from the University\r\nthere was nothing east of State Street, except an old burying ground and\r\none dwelling, occupied by the ubiquitous Pat Kelly, whose freedom of the\r\nagricultural privileges of the Campus made him quite as important a\r\nfinancial factor of the community as the members of the Faculty he\r\nserved.\r\n\r\nTo the north was a district known as the \"commons.\" Professor Ten Brook\r\ntells how he was accustomed every Sunday morning on his way to church in\r\nlower town, to strike across this open place to the ravine just west of\r\nthe present hospital buildings up which Glen Avenue now passes. Coming\r\nout on Fuller Street, the river road, he passed the old Kellogg\r\nfarmhouse, the only home until within a few blocks of the church across\r\nthe river. Lower town was but little smaller then than in these days; it\r\nhad its own schools as well as churches and when Ann Arbor received a\r\ncity charter in 1851 it held aloof for some time. The original\r\nsettlement about the Court-House Square extended no further to the west\r\nthan Allen's Creek for many years, while there was little to the south\r\nof the present William Street save scattered farmhouses and a large\r\nbrickyard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VIEW OF ANN ARBOR\r\nAcross the valley of the Huron--The hospital buildings with the\r\nUniversity beyond]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning Ann Arbor was solely a farming community, a character\r\nit retained essentially until the increasing number of manufacturing\r\nplants in recent years has somewhat changed its aspect. The first\r\ninhabitants were almost entirely New Englanders, true Yankees in faith,\r\nresourcefulness, and business enterprise. But it was not long before\r\nimmigrants of another type began to arrive; South Germans, who had left\r\ntheir native land to seek homes in the freer religious and political\r\natmosphere of the new world. They speedily became an important factor in\r\nthe growth of the town, as the business names on Main Street nowadays\r\nshow; almost all borne by descendants of the early German settlers, who\r\nhave for the most part identified themselves wholly with their new home.\r\nThis was revealed by the recent war. While there were some who, through\r\na sentimental attraction for the home of their fathers, stimulated by\r\nthe unscrupulous efforts of Germany's representatives, were actively\r\npro-German in their sympathies or at least violently torn between their\r\nlove for the old home and loyalty to the new land, there were many\r\nothers, probably the majority, who were out and out loyalists on every\r\noccasion, and who by spoken word and action proved their unhyphenated\r\nAmericanism. The brave record of the Ann Arbor men in the Civil War, and\r\nin France a half century later, where several of foreign parentage lost\r\ntheir lives, is ample proof of the solid qualities in this element among\r\nAnn Arbor's first inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWhatever their parentage or creed, the dwellers in the little double\r\ncommunity saw to it from the first that, at least in some measure, the\r\nreligious and intellectual needs of the people were satisfied. There is\r\nevidence that occasional religious services were held in 1825, but the\r\nfirst church, the Presbyterian, was not established until August, 1826.\r\nFor some years it was migratory in its meeting places, passing from a\r\nlog schoolhouse to a room in \"Cook's\" hotel and finally in 1829 to the\r\nfirst church built in Ann Arbor, an unpainted log structure 25 by 35\r\nfeet on the site of the present church on Huron Street. The other\r\ndenominations quickly followed this example and by 1844 there were six\r\nchurches to serve the needs of the 3,000 inhabitants of the village, as\r\nwell as the surrounding countryside, including the first Lutheran church\r\nfor the German-speaking settlers in Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe journalist also appeared on the scene in this prologue to the drama\r\nof the University's history. Less than six years after the arrival of\r\nthe first settlers, the first number of the _Western Emigrant_ appeared\r\non October 18, 1829. Like all country journals of that period it was far\r\nmore interested in national politics and even foreign affairs than local\r\nevents; any one who searches for a chronicle of the daily life of those\r\ntimes finds scant reward in the columns of these papers. Even so\r\nimportant an event as the first meeting of the Regents is dismissed with\r\na brief paragraph which throws no light on many interesting questions\r\nraised by the official report of that gathering. Yet such slender sheets\r\nas this, which eventually became the _State Journal_, and its Democratic\r\ncontemporary, the _Argus_, established in 1835, furnish a picture of the\r\nlife of those times in unexpected ways that would greatly surprise their\r\neditors, whose duty, as they saw it, was chiefly to guide the political\r\nopinions of their readers by strong and biting editorials, by long\r\nreports of legislative actions and by publishing the speeches of the\r\npolitical leaders of their party. The enterprise and industry of the\r\ncommunity shows up well in advertisements, where every form of trade\r\nsuitable for such a growing community found representation. One merchant\r\nadvertised some 125 packages of fine dress goods from the East in a long\r\nand alluring list anticipating the great celebration over the arrival of\r\nthe railroad; another firm, whose specialty was \"drugs, paints, oils,\r\ndye-stuffs, groceries,\" offered its wares \"for cash or barter, as cheap\r\nif not cheaper than they can be procured west of Detroit.\" Cook's\r\n\"Hotel\" announced a few years later that it had been \"greatly enlarged\r\nand fitted up in a style equal to any Public House in the place,\" and\r\nthat its location in the public square was \"one of the most pleasant and\r\nhealthy in Ann Arbor.\" The editor of the _Argus_ in 1844 revealed the\r\nsecrets of his business office in the following double-column notice:\r\n\r\n     Wood! Wood!\r\n\r\n     Those of our subscribers who wish to pay their subscriptions in\r\n     wood will please favor us immediately.\r\n\r\nProfessional ethics was not quite so tender a subject in those days as\r\nit is at present, for John Allen announces in 1835 that he maintains a\r\nlaw office for the convenience of his clients where he may be sought in\r\nconsultation, while \"Doct. S. Denton,\" whose subsequent standing as\r\nRegent and Professor was unquestioned, announces on April 2, 1835, that\r\nhe\r\n\r\n     Has Removed his Office to the Court House in the South Room on the\r\n     East side of the Hall. Those who call after bed-time will please\r\n     knock at the window if the door is fastened.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable also that even at this time, ten years after the\r\nvillage was founded, the spelling, \"Ann Arbour,\" is followed in numerous\r\nplaces while the _Argus_ in its headline gives it, \"Ann-Arbor,\" with a\r\nhyphen.\r\n\r\nAs with religion and politics, as represented by the newspapers of the\r\nday, so with education. It is not improbable that one of that group of\r\nnine log cabins which was Ann Arbor in 1825 housed a primary school;\r\ncertainly a school taught by Miss Monroe was under way that year at the\r\ncorner of Main and Ann streets. This was at first a private venture and\r\nwas housed in various places, but in 1829 it was finally moved into a\r\nbrick building,--on the jail lot, of all places!--and became a public\r\nenterprise. The children in the community were all small in those\r\ndays--there were only 141 children between five and fifteen years in\r\n1839--and it was not for some years that a need for secondary schools\r\nwas felt.\r\n\r\nThe first academy was established in 1829 where Greek and Latin and the\r\n\"higher branches of English education\" were taught. This was soon\r\ndiscontinued, to be succeeded by an academy in the rude building which\r\nserved the Presbyterian Church. Although this particular school was\r\nshort-lived, its successor soon came to be known as the best in the\r\nterritory and numbered the sons of many prominent Detroit families among\r\nits pupils. Several schools came in 1835, including an experiment some\r\ndistance out what is now Packard Street, known as the Manual Labor\r\nSchool, in which the pupils paid a part or the whole of their expenses\r\nby daily farm work.\r\n\r\nThe Misses Page also maintained for many years a very \"genteel\" young\r\nladies' seminary, long reckoned a most substantial and worthy school,\r\nwhere not only the classics, moral philosophy, and literature were\r\ntaught, but also heraldry,--an eminently useful branch in a pioneer\r\ncommunity! The lower town district as well was not without its schools\r\nand an academy. Provision was also made for pre-collegiate training\r\nduring the first years of the University. So it would appear that on the\r\nwhole Ann Arbor was well provided with schools from its earliest days.\r\n\r\nThe discontinuance of elementary work in the University, however, and a\r\nconsolidation of the schools of the two districts finally led to the\r\nestablishment of the Union High School in 1853. The first building was\r\nerected at a cost of $32,000 on the present site of the High School and\r\nwas opened to students in 1856, while most of the ward buildings were\r\nbuilt during the sixties. Close association with the University\r\nundoubtedly strengthened the Ann Arbor schools, and the High School soon\r\nbecame, in practice, a preparatory school for the University,\r\nparticularly after the organic connection between University and schools\r\nthrough the diploma system became effective. This enabled the Ann Arbor\r\nHigh School to become one of the best secondary schools of the State\r\nwith an attendance for many years far exceeding the normal enrolment in\r\nother cities of the same population.\r\n\r\nWhile the townspeople have always shown their pride in the University\r\nand their interest in its welfare, Ann Arbor has not escaped entirely\r\nthe traditional rivalries between town and gown. The village had a\r\nflourishing civic and commercial life before the first students came;\r\neven after it was established, the University for years was\r\ncomparatively small and made no great place for itself in local affairs,\r\nas one may easily surmise by the rare references to it in the early\r\nnewspapers. The members of the Faculty, however, were welcomed from the\r\nfirst as leaders in the community, though perhaps less can be said for\r\nthe students, whose irrepressible spirits often led them to carry things\r\nwith a high hand. Nor was the younger element in the town blameless. The\r\nresult was an occasional crisis which was sometimes serious.\r\n\r\nThe indignation meeting of the citizens over the modification of the\r\nbuilding program, as well as the similarly expressed support given the\r\nstudents in the fraternity struggle of 1850, were mentioned in the first\r\nchapter, and evidence a more cordial entente than is suggested by a\r\nserio-comic squabble in 1856 between the students and the Teutonic\r\nelement in the town, long known as the \"Dutch War.\" The original\r\ntrouble appears to have started in this case with the students, though\r\nit was probably the outgrowth of old animosities between them and the\r\nrougher and foreign elements in the town. For, despite vigorous efforts\r\non the part of the President and Faculty to enforce the law against the\r\nsale of liquor to undergraduates, many student difficulties were to be\r\ntraced to popular downtown resorts maintained largely by the German\r\ninhabitants. On this occasion the trouble started at \"Hangsterfer's,\" in\r\nan altercation between two students, who were making themselves\r\nunpleasant, and the proprietor of the place. The next night the students\r\nreturned in force and demanded free drinks, and, upon their being\r\nrefused, precipitated a general melee in which clubs were used and even\r\nknives were drawn. In the end, the unfortunate owners were chased to the\r\noutskirts of town by the uproarious students.\r\n\r\nBad feeling followed this episode and one night six uninvited students\r\nbroke into a ball at \"Binders's,\" where they surreptitiously helped\r\nthemselves to the refreshments--presumably liquid. One of them was\r\ncaptured and only released after planks had been brought to batter down\r\nthe brick walls of the building and a squad of medical students, armed\r\nwith muskets, had arrived on the scene. Warrants were sworn out for the\r\nsix the next day, but the officers were foiled by exchanges of clothing,\r\nby the culprits never eating in the same place twice, by their\r\nsubstituting for one another in recitations with the tacit approval,\r\napparently, of their instructors, and by concealment in the Observatory,\r\nor, in the case of three of them, in a Regent's house. Finally two\r\nstudents were sent down to the scene of the battle to buy liquor, and\r\nwith this as evidence, a sufficient case against the proprietor was\r\nsecured to induce him to withdraw his complaints. This ended the \"war.\"\r\n\r\nEqually objectionable to the Ann Arbor citizens, though more excusable\r\nperhaps, was the standing protest of the students at the condition of\r\nthe wooden sidewalks in the town, whose improvement apparently formed no\r\npart of the programme for civic betterment on the part of the good but\r\nconservative burghers. The students therefore constantly took matters in\r\ntheir own hands and about once in so often the offending rickety planks\r\nwent up in flames. The class of '73 thus celebrated after its\r\nexaminations in the spring of 1870. Their raid on the sidewalks had been\r\nunusually comprehensive and the city fathers became thoroughly aroused.\r\nArrests were threatened, and serious trouble was certain, when Acting\r\nPresident Frieze settled the matter by paying the $225 damages out of\r\nhis own slenderly lined pocket. This the offending class eventually made\r\nup to him by laying a tax upon its members, doubtless to the great\r\ndisgust of the innocent ones, \"who thought bad form had been displayed\r\nsomewhere.\" This experience, however, by no means ended the practice,\r\nwhich continued down to the present day of flag and cement. The\r\n_Chronicle_ once even took occasion to point out certain places where--\r\n\r\n     If the freshmen _insist_ upon celebrating their transition state by\r\n     the customary hints to citizens in regard to side-walks, etc., we\r\n     think we cannot do better than call their attention to a wretched\r\n     collection of rotten planks which lie along the fence on Division\r\n     Street, not far from William.\r\n\r\nThe local police force has always been fair game for the students, a\r\nposition \"he\" (to use the long-standing quip) did not always appreciate.\r\nGatherings of students in the streets were at one time looked upon with\r\ngreat disfavor, while the daily \"rushes\" at the old post-office, before\r\nthe days of carrier delivery, were particularly prolific sources of\r\ntrouble. The office before 1882 was especially inconvenient, and when\r\nthe officers, warned by previous trouble, proposed to allow students to\r\nenter only one at a time, which meant that many would go without their\r\nmail, a disturbance threatened at once, and several were arrested. The\r\nnext night matters proved even more serious; the fire-bell called out\r\nthe state militia, who charged with fixed bayonets and wounded several\r\npersons. A dozen students were jailed indiscriminately but no one could\r\nbe found to prefer charges the following morning. Suits for false\r\nimprisonment were brought against the city and mayor but were eventually\r\ndiscontinued on the advice of Judge Cooley.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1890, even more serious trouble arose following another\r\nseries of arrests for post-office \"rushing.\" During the evening sounds\r\nof rifle shots were heard, and the students, already excited, scented\r\nmore trouble. They gathered in a great crowd in front of the house where\r\nthe firing had occurred but found that it was only a wedding\r\ncelebration. Then, with characteristic good nature, they called for a\r\nspeech, but their intentions were misinterpreted, and when the militia,\r\nwho had attended the wedding in a body, marched out the students\r\nfollowed them with jokes and jeers. Finally the militiamen lost patience\r\nand charged with clubbed guns, and one quiet student who had been\r\napparently only a spectator, was felled to the ground and afterward died\r\nof his injury. The sergeant in charge of the soldiers was also seriously\r\ninjured. In this instance the students were guilty of nothing but noise,\r\nwhile the militia were acting entirely contrary to the law.\r\nNevertheless, though eight men were arrested, the blame could not be\r\nfixed on any one man. The Governor of the State, however, disbanded the\r\ncompany for its unsoldierly conduct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALONG THE HURON\r\nA glimpse of Ann Arbor's park system]\r\n\r\nWhile the growth of the University of late years would suggest a\r\ncorresponding increase in such troubles as have been described, the\r\nactual development has been quite otherwise, and serious clashes between\r\nstudents and townsfolk have been very rare in recent years. There have,\r\nit is true, been occasional raids on street-cars and signs; students\r\nhave been arrested for playing ball on the streets; and sometimes\r\npolitical meetings have been disturbed. One of the most amusing\r\nincidents of this character was an address given by W.J. Bryan in 1900\r\nfrom the portico of the Court House. Wild cheering greeted him as he\r\nrose to speak, which lasted for at least fifteen minutes. At first he\r\nwas obviously greatly flattered; then he began to suspect something was\r\nnot quite right and majestically raised his hand for silence. Instantly\r\nevery student waved his hand in response, and the exchange was continued\r\nfor some time. Meanwhile the police force was busy dragging off to jail\r\nany unlucky student on the outskirts of the crowd they could lay hands\r\non. When the speaker was at length able to make himself heard his first\r\nwords, somewhat unfortunate under the circumstances, were, \"If I were an\r\nimperialist I would call out an army to suppress you. But I am not.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be said, therefore, that in spite of these occasional troubles\r\nthe relations between town and gown have been on the whole surprisingly\r\nnormal and friendly when we consider that at present over one-fourth of\r\nthe total population of Ann Arbor during term-time is composed of\r\nstudents. This cordial relationship is undoubtedly fostered by the fact\r\nthat all the men and many of the women outside the fraternities, live\r\nin rooms rented from the townspeople. The extent to which this system\r\nhas developed is probably unique in any American university of the same\r\nsize. Only very recently has there been any modification of the\r\ntradition, in the erection of women's dormitories and a promise of\r\nsimilar buildings for the men.\r\n\r\nWhile this arrangement is not ideal in many ways, for the students do\r\nnot always secure the clean and attractive quarters they are properly\r\nentitled to have, it has been undoubtedly a great advantage to the\r\nUniversity in relieving it of the expense and trouble of maintaining\r\ndormitories, at a time when every dollar of resources, to say nothing of\r\nthe energies of the officers, was necessary to maintain the University's\r\nwork. It is only natural, however, that many disputes between students\r\nand landladies should arise, particularly when the rooming and boarding\r\nhouses are not supervised by the University: This is the case with the\r\nmen. For some time the women in the University have been allowed to live\r\nonly in approved rooming houses. The Health Service has also undertaken\r\nto inspect all the student boarding houses in an effort to ensure\r\nwholesome food and to maintain a definite standard of cleanliness.\r\n\r\nWhatever the minor sources of friction that have arisen between the\r\nstudents and townsfolk of Ann Arbor, however, the substantial\r\nfriendliness of the citizens and their pride in the University have\r\nalways been one of its great assets through its years of development.\r\nThe promoters of the hastily organized land company through whose\r\nefforts Ann Arbor was made the site of the future University builded\r\nbetter than they knew. Their venture was probably not a particularly\r\nprofitable one, for the rapid growth they had expected did not\r\nmaterialize. But their prompt action and foresight assured the\r\ninstitution a normal and healthy environment comparatively free from\r\npolitical and commercial influences. There are, undoubtedly, certain\r\nadvantages which come to the modern university in a larger city, which\r\nbecomes in a way a laboratory for various forms of scientific\r\ninvestigation; but the disadvantages are no less obvious. The life of\r\nthe students becomes more complicated; social distractions and\r\namusements are apt to offer too great temptations; the simplicity of\r\nacademic life is lost; while the personal relations between Faculty and\r\nstudent become more perfunctory. Thus by her very situation Michigan has\r\nbeen able to retain, in spite of her extraordinary growth in recent\r\nyears, something of that fine flavor of college life which has always\r\nbeen the essence of our best academic traditions.\r\n\r\nIn the first days the Campus was only a backwoods clearing with lines of\r\nforest oaks on the east and south, the fence-rows of the Rumsey farm,\r\nand from it the stumps of the original forest trees had to be removed\r\nbefore the University was opened. For many years it was, to all intents,\r\na farm lot upon which a few scattered buildings were to be seen. The\r\nearly Regents and Faculty were necessarily occupied with pressing\r\npractical problems, and the first steps toward rendering the Campus more\r\nattractive were very casual and ineffective. The sum of $200 was given\r\nDr. Houghton for the planting of trees in 1840 but action was delayed\r\nbecause of Pat Kelly's wheat, and when eventually the trees were\r\nplanted--tradition has it they were locusts--they were soon destroyed by\r\ninsects. Andrew D. White describes the Campus when he came to the\r\nUniversity in 1857 as \"unkempt and wretched. Throughout its whole space\r\nthere were not more than a score of trees outside the building sites\r\nallotted to professors; unsightly plank walks connected the buildings,\r\nand in every direction were meandering paths, which in dry weather were\r\ndusty and in wet weather muddy.\"\r\n\r\nYet as early as 1847 the forlorn condition of the Campus began to be\r\nofficially noticed; appropriations of small sums were made from time to\r\ntime for trees and shrubs and a scheme for the laying out of avenues and\r\nwalks and the planting of groups of trees was adopted. Unfortunately,\r\nthe trees came before the walks, and as they were all of quick-growing\r\nvarieties the effort did not go far. Nevertheless a vision of the\r\ntraditional academic grove appeared in the report of the visiting\r\nCommittee of that year, which recommended that \"regard should be had, in\r\nmaking the selection, to the cleanliness, desirability, symmetry, and\r\nbeauty of foliage of the trees to be planted\" and observed that \"the\r\nhighway of thought, and intellectual development and progress, much of\r\nwhich is parched and rugged, should, as far as may be, be refreshed with\r\nfountains and strewn with flowers.\" Truly, an alluring picture! The\r\nFaculty, however, somewhat more practical, insisted on walks, protesting\r\nthat they were \"obliged before clear day to wend their way to their\r\nrecitations through darkness and mud.\" A similar plan was undertaken in\r\n1854 when citizens, students, and Faculty all joined in the work, the\r\ncitizens to set out a row of trees on the farther side of the streets\r\noutside the Campus, while the students and Faculty were to do the same\r\non the Campus side. Five hundred trees were thus set out within the\r\ngrounds while an equal number was added through an appropriation by the\r\nRegents. But apparently small success attended these efforts, for few of\r\nthese trees have survived.\r\n\r\nIt was with the coming of the young Andrew D. White, as Professor of\r\nHistory, with his youthful enthusiasm and memories of the \"glorious elms\r\nof Yale,\" that the first effective effort for the improvement of the\r\nCampus began. He says, in his Autobiography:\r\n\r\n     Without permission from any one, I began planting trees within the\r\n     university enclosure; established, on my own account, several\r\n     avenues; and set out elms to overshadow them. Choosing my trees\r\n     with care, carefully protecting and watering them during the first\r\n     two years, and gradually adding to them a considerable number of\r\n     evergreens, I preached practically the doctrine of adorning the\r\n     Campus. Gradually some of my students joined me; one class after\r\n     another aided in securing trees and planting them, others became\r\n     interested, until, finally, the University authorities made me\r\n     \"superintendent of the grounds,\" and appropriated to my work the\r\n     munificent sum of seventy-five dollars a year. So began the\r\n     splendid growth which now surrounds those buildings.\r\n\r\nHis example was doubtless infectious, for the Ann Arbor citizens\r\ncontinued their tree-planting efforts around the outside of the Campus\r\nin the spring of 1858, while a group of sixty trees presented to the\r\nUniversity were set out inside. The seniors of '58 left a memorial in\r\nthe shape of concentric rings of maples about a native oak in the center\r\nof the Campus, one of the few survivals of the original forest growth,\r\nwhich has since become known as the Tappan Oak, and is now marked by a\r\ntablet on a boulder placed there in later years by '58. Many of these\r\nmaples still survive, though all traces of the circles are lost. The\r\njuniors also set out another group further to the east, while Professor\r\nFasquelle planted a number of evergreens east of the north wing to\r\nbalance a similar group of Professor White's at the south. The maples\r\noutside the walk on State Street were also the gift of Professor White\r\nand were balanced by a similar row of elms on the inside, given by the\r\nFaculty of the Literary Department. This general interest in Campus\r\nimprovement did not escape the Regents and successive appropriations,\r\nthough comparatively small, continued the work until Michigan now has,\r\nin the words of the father of the movement, written forty-six years\r\nafter his work was undertaken, \"one of the most beautiful academic\r\ngroves to be seen in any part of the world,\"--a monument to him and to\r\nthe students of his time.\r\n\r\nThe development of the building program, if a thing so haphazard can go\r\nby that name, was less fortunate for the University. Only in very recent\r\nyears has there been any appreciation of the need of some degree of\r\nuniformity and planning for the future. Many of the present buildings\r\nhave been evolved, as the needs of the University grew, rather than\r\nplanned, while others have been built to suit the tastes of certain\r\nofficers, or the special needs of the departments concerned, with no\r\nreference to the larger unity which has come to be recognized as so\r\nnecessary in any group of buildings. Some of the oldest buildings have\r\ngone; in particular the two residences on the north, which became the\r\nold Dental College and the Homeopathic School in their last\r\nincarnations, while the picturesque old Medical Building followed them a\r\nfew years later. The two on the south still survive; the President's\r\nHouse, though often remodeled, still retains its old lines, but the\r\nadjacent building, now known as the Old Engineering Building and used\r\nlargely for instruction in modern languages in the Engineering College,\r\nhas lost all semblance of its former character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IN THE SEVENTIES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAMPUS ELMS]\r\n\r\nSimilarly the Law Building has undergone many transformations, while\r\nthe old Chemistry Building, now used by the Departments of Physiology,\r\nMateria Medica, and Economics as make-shift quarters, has lost through\r\nsuccessive additions almost all trace of that first little laboratory\r\nwhich exemplified the progressive spirit of the University in her early\r\ndays. The new Chemistry Building on the north side was completed in 1910\r\nand cost with equipment about $300,000. It is four stories high, 230\r\nfeet long by 130 feet wide, and is built about two interior courts. The\r\nbuilding contains two amphitheaters, laboratories for organic and\r\nqualitative chemistry, metallurgy, physical chemistry, and gas analysis,\r\nas well as the College of Pharmacy.\r\n\r\nJust beside it to the west rises the largest building on the Campus, the\r\nNatural Science Building, which houses the Departments of Botany,\r\nGeology, Forestry, Mineralogy, Zooelogy, and Psychology. This building,\r\nwhich was something of a departure in laboratory construction when it\r\nwas completed in 1916, is built upon the unit system, and consists\r\nessentially of concrete piers, whose uniform spacing divides the rooms\r\nand laboratories into equal units, or multiples, with practically the\r\ntotal width between piers opening into windows. This is, in effect, a\r\nmodern adaptation of the old Gothic principle, though it emphasizes the\r\nhorizontal and lacks entirely the buttresses and pinnacles which gave\r\nthe medieval church builders their inspiration. It marks, however, a new\r\nera in laboratory construction, for not only are the laboratories\r\nflooded with light, but they are carefully designed for the purpose for\r\nwhich they are to be used. It is also to be noted that each department\r\nis installed in a complete section of four floors, from basement to top.\r\nThe building, which cost $375,000, has about 155,000 square feet of\r\nfloor space and like the neighboring Chemistry Building is built about\r\nan open court. The same principle of construction has also been followed\r\nas far as practicable in the new Library Building.\r\n\r\nOther buildings on the Campus which have not been mentioned elsewhere\r\nare the Physics Laboratory, the Museum, and Tappan Hall. The Physics\r\nLaboratory was built in 1886-87. Within twenty years it proved\r\ninadequate and in 1905 an addition costing $45,000 became necessary,\r\nwhich contains among other features a well-equipped lecture room\r\naccommodating four hundred students. Until the completion of the larger\r\nlecture room in the Natural Science Building this was in great demand\r\nfor many University lectures. Tappan Hall, a class-room building, in a\r\nportion of which the Department of Education now has its headquarters,\r\nwas erected in 1894-95 and stands near the southwest corner of the\r\nCampus just at the rear of Alumni Memorial Hall.\r\n\r\nThe University Museum was erected in 1881 and stands between University\r\nHall and Alumni Memorial Hall. It is far from being the most successful\r\nof the University Buildings architecturally, and as it has been for some\r\ntime entirely inadequate for the collections it houses, it will not be\r\nmany years before the need for a new museum will be presented to the\r\nLegislature. In addition to the offices of the Curator, Professor A.G.\r\nRuthven, Morningside, '03, and his staff, the building contains the\r\nUniversity's zooelogical and anthropological collections, very popular\r\nwith casual visitors to the Campus. The former includes a fine exhibit\r\nof mounted mammals and some 1,600 birds, as well as reptiles, fishes,\r\nmollusks and insects, in all of which particular effort has been made to\r\nshow forms native to the State. The Anthropological Collection includes\r\nthe entire exhibit of the Chinese Government at the New Orleans\r\nExposition in 1885, as well as many items from China and the\r\nPhilippines, collected by the Beal-Steere Expedition. The collections in\r\ngeology, mineralogy, botany, materia medica, chemistry, the industrial\r\narts, and the fine arts are to be found in the Natural Science Building\r\nand other buildings devoted to these special subjects.\r\n\r\nFor many years the original forty acres of the Rumsey farm were more\r\nthan ample for the needs of the University. The Observatory, the first\r\nbuilding to find a place apart from the Campus, was set upon its hilltop\r\nsome distance northeast, because of the need of clear air and quiet;\r\nadvantages now almost lost in the proximity of the hospitals, heating\r\nplant, and railroads that portends an eventual change in location. The\r\nObservatory has grown rapidly since its establishment by Dr. Tappan in\r\n1852. The building was last remodeled and enlarged in 1911 when a\r\nreflecting telescope, with a 37-5/8 inch parabolic mirror, largely made\r\nin the shops of the University, was installed. In light gathering power\r\nthis instrument is in a class with the Lick and Yerkes refractors, and\r\nit is at least as effective in astronomical photography, the purpose for\r\nwhich it was designed. The new brick tower, with its copper-covered\r\ndome, rises sixty feet above the basement and is forty feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nJust beyond the Observatory, on the crest of the hills defining the\r\nHuron valley, is the largest group of university buildings off the\r\nCampus, the old University Hospitals, which are to be replaced in 1922\r\nby the new Hospital, ground for which was broken in September, 1919.\r\nFollowing the erection of the first building in 1891 an office building\r\nwas added in 1896 to be followed rapidly by other sections, including a\r\nchildren's pavilion erected in 1901, known as the Palmer Ward, the\r\nbequest of the widow of Dr. Alonzo B. Palmer, who also left $15,000 for\r\nthe maintenance of free beds in it. The entire group of buildings\r\nnumbers ten, including the State Psychopathic Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe new Hospital is to be one of the largest and most completely\r\nequipped in America. It is composed of a series of wings taking the\r\ngeneral form of a double letter \"Y\" connected at the stems, with a\r\nsmaller office building in front and a larger wing containing\r\nlaboratories, operating and class rooms at the rear. The building is 420\r\nfeet long and six stories high with provision for an additional three\r\nstories at some future time. It is built of reinforced concrete upon\r\nregularly spaced piers, and is similar in construction to the Natural\r\nScience Building.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Homeopathic Department is centered in its fine Hospital\r\nbuilding with an adjacent Children's Ward and Nurses' Home just off the\r\nnortheast corner of the Campus. The Dental Building, erected in 1908, is\r\nsituated to the west, just across the street from the Gymnasium. It\r\ncontains many laboratories and lecture rooms, as well as an operating\r\nroom fitted with eighty dental chairs.\r\n\r\nOf the other buildings off the Campus, the new Union, Hill Auditorium\r\nand the three dormitories for women are the most conspicuous. The Union,\r\nwith its magnificent tower and imposing yet withal beautifully\r\nproportioned masses, has been mentioned as the dominant architectural\r\nfeature of State Street. Hill Auditorium, which was made possible by a\r\nbequest of $200,000 left by Regent Arthur Hill, '65_e_, of Saginaw upon\r\nhis death in 1909, forms one of the unique features of the University's\r\nequipment. Despite its seating capacity, with the stage, of over 5,000,\r\nit has almost perfect acoustic properties, so that a whisper from the\r\nstage can be heard in any portion of this great hall. Its completion in\r\n1913 enabled the University at last to bring the great part of the\r\nstudents together under one roof upon such occasions as the annual\r\nconvocation, the official opening of the University in the fall. The\r\nproblem connected with the admission of relatives and friends of the\r\ngraduating classes to the Commencement exercises, which had proved\r\nexceedingly troublesome for many years, was also at last ended; while\r\nthe musical interests of Ann Arbor, particularly the annual May\r\nFestival, immediately found an opportunity for further expansion in this\r\nhall, whose advantages as a concert hall were praised by every visiting\r\nmusician. The building, which is finished in tapestry brick and terra\r\ncotta, stands opposite the Natural Science Building on North University\r\nAvenue. In addition to the great auditorium, it contains offices and\r\nclass rooms, a dressing-room for choruses, and a great foyer across the\r\nfront of the second floor, where the Stearns collection of musical\r\ninstruments, one of the finest in America, is installed. The great organ\r\nfrom the Chicago World's Fair is also placed in this building as a\r\nmemorial to Professor Henry S. Frieze, the pioneer in Michigan's\r\ndevelopment as a musical center.\r\n\r\nThe University now has four dormitories or halls of residence for women.\r\nTwo of them were completed in 1916; the Martha Cook Building on South\r\nUniversity Avenue, given by the Cook family of Hillsdale, in memory of\r\ntheir mother, and the Newberry Hall of Residence on State Street, a\r\nmemorial to Helen Handy Newberry, the wife of John S. Newberry, '47,\r\ngiven by her children. The Martha Cook Building is probably the most\r\nsumptuous and complete college dormitory in America and cost something\r\nover $500,000. It is an unusually beautiful example of Tudor Gothic,\r\nalways a favorite style for college buildings. Simple in its main lines\r\nit reveals an extraordinary perfection in detail as well as comfort in\r\nits appointments and a richness in decoration which cannot but have its\r\nhappy influence on the one hundred and seventeen fortunate women who\r\nlive there. Less elaborate but equally attractive as a home for the\r\nseventy-five girls it is built to accommodate is the Newberry Building,\r\nwhich, though smaller and simpler in its architecture, embodies every\r\nessential found in the larger building. It is of hollow tile and stucco\r\nand cost about $100,000. Similar in general plan and appointments,\r\nthough built of brick, is the adjacent Betsy Barbour Dormitory, which\r\nwas completed in 1920, the gift of Ex-Regent Levi L. Barbour, '63,\r\n'65_l_, of Detroit. It stands on the site of the old ward school\r\nbuilding on State Street, used for many years by the University as a\r\nrecitation building, and soon to be razed now the new dormitory, just to\r\nthe rear, is completed. Alumnae House, the fourth girls' residence hall,\r\nwas, as the name implies, furnished by the alumnae of the University. It\r\nwas made over from a quaint old dwelling on Washtenaw Avenue at a cost\r\nof about $18,000, and accommodates sixteen self-supporting students.\r\n\r\nA final group of buildings, very necessary in an institution so large as\r\nthe University, is composed of the heating and lighting plant, the\r\nnearby laundry in the one-time ravine at the east of the old \"Cat-hole,\"\r\nand the University shops and storehouse a little distance south. The old\r\npower house near the Engineering Building was abandoned in 1914 when the\r\nnew plant, situated on a lower level than the Campus and reached by a\r\nspur from the railroad, was ready for service. It cost approximately a\r\nthird of a million dollars, and furnishes heat, compressed air,\r\nelectrical energy, and hot water to the Campus and adjacent buildings\r\nthrough a series of tunnels nearly ten feet high which extend as far as\r\nthe Union, half a mile across the Campus.\r\n\r\nAside from the smaller and the more temporary buildings and the many\r\ndwelling houses on property recently acquired, the buildings of the\r\nUniversity number about forty. This does not include the buildings\r\noccupied by the Y.M.C.A. and the Y.W.C.A., or the Psychopathic Hospital,\r\nthe titles to which do not rest with the Board of Regents.\r\n\r\nThough the buildings on the Campus have not, until very recently, been\r\nplaced with any careful relationship to a general scheme, and exhibit a\r\nvery unfortunate lack of architectural harmony, in certain features the\r\nCampus gives promise of better things in the future. Some of the\r\nbuildings have real beauty, though it is too often lost in an\r\nunfavorable environment. Charming details are to be found here and\r\nthere, while the green canopy of the elms and maples planted sixty years\r\nago helps to give our academic field a real distinction. Fortunately the\r\ncenter of the Campus has been left comparatively free of buildings, save\r\nfor the rambling old Chemistry Building, now used by the departments of\r\nPhysiology and Economics, and the plain but imposing bulk of the new\r\nLibrary Building, a fitting center whence paths diverge in every\r\ndirection to the halls and laboratories along the avenues that mark the\r\nouter confines of the Campus. Lack of funds and the imperative need of\r\nroom, and yet more room, for the thousands of new students, has severely\r\nlimited the Regents in the matter of adornment of the buildings erected\r\nin recent years, which have all tended to conform to one type, simple,\r\ndignified in their very rectangular bulk, and relieved only by patterns\r\nin tapestry brick and terra cotta trimmings.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years, too, the new buildings have been carefully placed,\r\nnot only with reference to the present Campus, but also the inevitable\r\nnortheastward growth of the University toward the hills lining the\r\nriver. For some time the Regents have been acquiring scattered parcels\r\nof property as occasion presented, and now own a good share of the land\r\nin the triangle bounded roughly by Hill Auditorium, the University\r\nHospitals and Palmer Field, an area twice as large as the present\r\nCampus. In addition there is the University Arboretum and Botanical\r\nGardens, a large area south and east of Forest Hill Cemetery, which is\r\nnow linked up by boulevards with the rapidly growing system of city\r\nparks.\r\n\r\nA formal entrance to the Campus in the form of a double driveway, laid\r\nout in accordance with a plan prepared in 1906 by Professor Emil Lorch\r\nof the Department of Architecture, and known as the Mall, passes between\r\nthe Chemistry and Natural Science Buildings. This forms practically a\r\ncontinuation of Ingalls Street between Hill Auditorium and a future\r\ncompanion, possibly a new Museum, which will eventually be built to the\r\neast on the other corner. The impressive vista thus formed leads the eye\r\nto the massive facade of the new Library, though the Campus flagstaff,\r\nsome distance in front, now marks the actual end of the new driveway.\r\nThe architectural emphasis of the Campus is thus being turned to the\r\nnorth, but the western, or State Street side still remains the accepted\r\nfront, dominated by the old-fashioned but nevertheless stately bulk of\r\nold University Hall. Within a short time State Street has become,\r\nthrough the fortunate removal of several unsightly old survivals of\r\nearlier days, one of the most beautiful of academic avenues, flanked on\r\none side by the Campus, with its trees, broad spaces and dignified\r\nbuildings, and by a row of public buildings on the western side, which,\r\nthough sadly lacking in uniformity, are yet for the most part impressive\r\nand substantial. These include the Congregational Church, the two halls\r\nof residence for women, the older Newberry Hall, a number of fraternity\r\nhouses, and particularly the commanding beauty of the Michigan Union.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for the University and the community that the problem of\r\nthe future development of the institution in relation to the city is\r\nbeing carefully considered. The expansion of the Campus to the north and\r\nnortheast is now established, and it is probable that at some future\r\nperiod the Mall, lined with monumental buildings, and laid out in\r\nco-operation with the city, will extend to the river. Ann Arbor has\r\nalready taken far-sighted measures in establishing a series of\r\nboulevards and parks along the river with connecting links which will\r\neventually encircle the town. The extensive University properties in the\r\nArboretum and Botanical Gardens, which cover the hills defining the\r\nravine extending from the river to Geddes Avenue, and join the present\r\nenlarged University grounds at the Observatory, form part of this\r\nsystem. Plans are now under consideration for a rearrangement of\r\nstreets, which will afford easier access from the Campus to the\r\nHospitals and the boulevards and river drives. These will give to this\r\nportion of the future University grounds an irregularity and\r\npicturesqueness wholly lacking on the flat hilltop occupied by the\r\npresent Campus. One of the difficulties in this plan is the old\r\n\"Cat-hole,\" the end of a ravine, whose steep hillsides extend from the\r\nriver practically to the northeast corner of the Campus. Though this\r\nunsightly boghole has been gradually filled in, it still forms a blot on\r\nthe landscape which might, nevertheless, with a little effort and\r\ncomparatively small expense, be transformed into a charming open air\r\ntheater. This in fact has been recommended by Mr. Frederick Law\r\nOlmstead, the landscape architect, who has made an extensive study of\r\nthe whole problem for the city and the University.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for the University that this plan for the future,\r\ntentative though it may be at present, is actually a part of a large\r\nscheme for the improvement of the city, suggested by Mr. Olmstead. Ann\r\nArbor is fast becoming one of the most beautiful little cities in the\r\ncountry, with winding streets, shaded by noble maples and elms and many\r\nof the original forest oaks, and lined by substantial homes, charming in\r\ntheir simple architecture and setting. This development came at first,\r\nas was natural, largely from the Faculty, but an increasing number of\r\nfamilies from Detroit and elsewhere have of late come to make Ann Arbor\r\ntheir permanent residence, attracted by the unusual beauty of the city\r\nand the advantages afforded by the University. The sightly range of\r\nhills along the Huron between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti and about the new\r\nBarton Pond, two miles to the north and west of the city, recently\r\ndeveloped as a water-power site, are soon to be dotted here and there\r\nwith comfortable and attractive country homes, which promise to change\r\nthe entire character of Ann Arbor's environs. The little country town of\r\nthe past is fast disappearing.\r\n\r\nWith these plans rapidly evolving there is every reason to hope that, at\r\nno distant period, the University may find an imposing physical setting\r\nmore in keeping with her standing among American universities. The\r\npresent is an era of transition; as yet she has hardly had time to\r\nadjust herself to the extraordinary growth of the last ten years; still\r\nless to realize all the problems it involves. But it requires no great\r\nvision to see the University of the future occupying at last the heights\r\noverlooking the Huron valley which that unfortunate decision at the\r\nfirst meeting of the Regents denied to her in 1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE UNIVERSITY IN WAR TIMES\r\n\r\n\r\nMichigan has had a most honorable record in the three wars in which the\r\ncountry has been engaged since the first class was graduated. Though two\r\nof her early graduates were veterans of the Mexican War, it was not\r\nuntil the Civil War that the opportunity came to show what kind of\r\ncitizens of the Republic were in the making in this pioneer State\r\nUniversity. The catalogue of 1864 lists only 999 graduates. Yet the\r\nnumber of Michigan men who served in the Civil War was within a few of\r\n2,000. This number of course includes many students who left never to\r\nreturn and many who entered the University, particularly the\r\nprofessional schools, in the years immediately after the war.\r\nPractically half of the members of the classes of '59, '60, '61, and '62\r\nserved in the war, and '62 alone lost seven members out of twenty-two in\r\nservice. The college men of the sixties were no less ready than their\r\ngrandsons in 1917.\r\n\r\nFeeling ran high in the University during the period just before the\r\nCivil War. The students were nearly all strong and vigorous products of\r\npioneer life, good hunters and rifle shots, with a love of individual\r\nliberty and free speech. Many were studying for the ministry.\r\nAnti-slavery sentiment was all but unanimous, except for the one or two\r\nstudents from the South, but few could be called out and out\r\nabolitionists. It is difficult nowadays to understand the sentiment\r\nwhich led to the mobbing of an abolitionist speaker, Parker Pillsbury,\r\nsome months before war was declared. He knew from personal experience\r\nthat the South was arming and came to urge the citizens of the North to\r\nprepare for the struggle. Yet when he attempted to speak in Ann Arbor a\r\nmob collected and would have none of his advice; they stormed the little\r\nFree Church on North State Street, driving audience and speaker out of\r\nthe rear windows and gutting the building. Similar troubles were\r\nthreatened when Wendell Phillips was advertised to speak on abolition a\r\nmonth or so later. In view of the first experience, there was great\r\ndifficulty in finding a hall, but finally the trustees of the old\r\nCongregational Church decided that if the building \"must be razed to the\r\nground, let it go down in behalf of free speech and the great cause of\r\nliberty.\" The class of '61 also decided that free speech must be\r\nprotected, and on the appointed evening was present in force with\r\nhickory clubs, twelve members in front and more scattered about inside.\r\nWhile the church was packed there was no demonstration, though the mob\r\n\"howled outside.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the students who heard Phillips that night left confirmed\r\nabolitionists, and some were among the first to take up arms. To us,\r\nnowadays, the state of public opinion at that time seems almost\r\nincomprehensible. Few of the individual members of those mobs were in\r\nreal sympathy with the South, but party affiliations were strong and, in\r\nthe words of Judge Cheever, '63, who describes these troubles, they were\r\nheld back from openly showing abolitionist principles by \"their fear\r\nthat an open contest would lead to the destruction of the government.\"\r\nWithin a year a good part of the rioters were in the Union Army.\r\n\r\nThroughout the troubled period preceding the actual outbreak of war,\r\nPresident Tappan was circumspect in his public utterances, and was\r\nconsidered conservative on the slavery question though he presided at\r\nthe Wendell Phillips meeting. The professorial radical of those days was\r\nthe young Andrew D. White. He was in closer touch with the students than\r\nhis colleagues, and his personal influence and brilliant lectures on\r\nmodern history swept his students on into bold opinions and resolute\r\naction.\r\n\r\nWhen Sumter was fired upon the University was aflame at once. Although\r\nit was Sunday when the news of the surrender came, there was no thought\r\nof services. A platform of boxes and planks was raised on the Court\r\nHouse Square and Dr. Tappan was sent for. Upon his arrival, Bible in\r\nhand, he found a large and a serious gathering awaiting him. Heretofore\r\nPresident Tappan had permitted himself to say little, though his\r\nstudents were thrilled occasionally by some remark which showed how\r\nkeenly alive he was to the great issues of the time. Now he could speak.\r\nAfter reading some heroic passages from the Old Testament, he spoke, in\r\nthe words of Gen. W.H.H. Beadle, '61,--\r\n\r\n     With mind and heart and soul in heroic agony, as if long-formed\r\n     opinions and long silenced feelings now burst into utterance.... In\r\n     all Michigan's history this was the great historic occasion.\r\n\r\nThe contemporaries of Dr. Tappan are unanimous in their judgment of his\r\nextraordinary ability as a speaker, to which a majestic figure and\r\nmagnificent voice no less than his logic and apt illustrations\r\ncontributed. But on this day he made the effort of his career. From that\r\ntime the University was whole-heartedly for the Union and the war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAPTAINS OF THE THREE STUDENT COMPANIES IN 1861\r\nCharles Kendall Adams, '61. Captain of the University Guards Isaac H.\r\nElliott, '61. Captain of the Chancellor Greys Albert Nye, '62. Captain\r\nof the Ellsworth Zouaves]\r\n\r\nStudent companies were organized at once; and the Tappan Guards under\r\nCharles Kendall Adams, '61, the Chancellor Greys, under Isaac H. Elliot,\r\n'62, and the Ellsworth Zouaves, under Albert Nye, '62, who died at\r\nMurfreesboro in 1862, formed a University Battalion which enrolled\r\npractically every student in the University. This was not the first\r\neffort of the sort, however, for five years before Professor W.P.\r\nTrowbridge, a graduate of West Point, had organized the first University\r\nBattalion, with uniforms and arms furnished by the Government, and had\r\nmanaged to have a small building erected as an armory, which was later\r\nto become the first gymnasium. This experiment was short-lived and came\r\nto an end when Professor Trowbridge resigned the following year. With\r\nthe organization of the new battalion the duty of drill master fell upon\r\nJoseph H. Vance, the steward of the University, who was also assistant\r\nlibrarian. The President set apart a room at the south end of the south\r\nCollege, and there the students, in sections of fifty, drilled for an\r\nhour each day. The old muskets had been called in by the Government some\r\ntime before, and sticks were perforce the ordinary armament. This drill\r\ncontinued for the rest of the year and for most of 1862. The men who\r\nthus received their preliminary training were to be found later in\r\npractically every corps and division of the Union Army.\r\n\r\nThese military efforts, however, did not satisfy the more restless\r\nspirits and many left the University immediately, few of whom ever\r\nreturned to finish their course. Of the fifty-four who graduated with\r\nthe \"war class\" of '61, twenty-four entered the service, in addition to\r\neight who did not stay to finish their work, in all thirty-two out of\r\nsixty-two. The students in the two professional departments were no less\r\neager for service, as is shown by the remarkable record of the medical\r\nclass of '61, thirty of whose forty-four graduates saw active service.\r\nAmong the Michigan men in the Civil War at least twelve, eight of whom\r\nheld degrees, rose to the rank of brigadier-general, three of them from\r\nthe class of '61. Of this number apparently only one, Elon Farnsworth,\r\n'55-'58, actually commanded a brigade in battle. He was killed while\r\nbravely leading a hopeless charge at Gettysburg.\r\n\r\nMichigan's war records are full of stories of brave deeds, but few\r\nsurpass the heroism of William Longshaw, '59_m_, an assistant surgeon in\r\nthe Navy, who undertook to carry a line from his ship, the _Nahant_, to\r\nthe _Lehigh_, which had run aground in the attack on Fort Moultrie.\r\nTwice he was successful but the intense fire directed on his little boat\r\nby the batteries on shore cut the line each time. By this time Longshaw\r\nfound the wounded needing his attention and he gave over the task to\r\nanother who made a third and successful trip. For this exploit Longshaw\r\nwas cited in general orders read from every quarter-deck in the fleet.\r\nHe was killed while attending a wounded marine under equally heroic\r\ncircumstances during the attack on Fort Fisher.\r\n\r\nWhile Michigan men entered service from every Union State, the largest\r\nnumber, naturally, were in the Michigan regiments, particularly the\r\nTwentieth Michigan Infantry, in which a large number of officers,\r\nincluding every one in the two Ann Arbor companies, were University men.\r\nIn one year, November, 1863, to November, 1864, 537 of the Regiment's\r\ntotal enrolment of 1,157 were killed, wounded, or prisoners, while three\r\ntimes it lost almost fifty percent of all the men engaged, at\r\nSpottsylvania, at Petersburg, and finally at the assault on the Crater,\r\nafter which there were only eighty men and four officers left for duty.\r\nIn another Michigan regiment, the Seventh, was Capt. Allan H. Zacharias\r\nof the class of '60 whose last letter, written on an old envelope and\r\nclutched in his dead hand, forms an imperishable portion of Michigan's\r\nannals:\r\n\r\n     Dear Parent, Brothers and Sisters: I am wounded, mortally I think.\r\n     The fight rages round me. I have done my duty. This is my\r\n     consolation. I hope to meet you all again. I left not the line\r\n     until all had fallen and colors gone. I am getting weak. My arms\r\n     are free but below my chest all is numb. The enemy trotting over\r\n     me. The numbness up to my heart. Good-bye all.\r\n\r\nYour son\r\nAllen.\r\n\r\nWithin a year after peace was declared a plan was under way for a\r\nMemorial Building in memory of the graduates of the University who had\r\nfallen in the war. A committee appointed by the Alumni Association\r\npresented the matter to the Board of Regents, but they were unable to\r\ntake any action. The project was never forgotten, however, and was\r\nbrought up year after year in alumni gatherings until in 1903 a\r\ncommittee under the Chairmanship of Judge C.B. Grant, '59, a former\r\nColonel of the Twentieth Michigan, was appointed. This committee was so\r\nsuccessful in its efforts that the Memorial Building was eventually\r\ndedicated in May, 1910. A large tablet by the sculptor A.A. Weinman\r\nbearing the inscription given on the following page, was placed, in\r\nJune, 1914, on the right wall just inside the entrance.\r\n\r\nA further investigation of the war records of the graduates of the\r\nUniversity revealed many more names than were known when the tablet was\r\ndesigned, so that now the total in the morocco bound volume which is\r\nconspicuously placed in the building carries the records of 2,424 who\r\nserved in the three wars.\r\n\r\n THIS HALL ERECTED ANNO DOMINI 1909-1910\r\n UNDER DIRECTION OF THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION BY THE ALUMNI\r\n AND FRIENDS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IS DEDICATED\r\n TO THE MEMORY OF HER PATRIOTIC SONS WHO SERVED IN\r\n\r\n     THREE OF HER COUNTRY'S WARS NAMELY\r\n     TWO IN THE MEXICAN WAR A.D. 1847\r\n     ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FOURTEEN\r\n     IN THE CIVIL WAR A.D. 1861-1865\r\n\r\n FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SIX IN THE SPANISH WAR A.D. 1898\r\n A RECORD OF THEIR NAMES AND MILITARY HISTORY IS\r\n DEPOSITED IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n THE WORLD WILL LITTLE NOTE NOR LONG REMEMBER WHAT WE\r\n SAY HERE BUT IT CAN NEVER FORGET WHAT THEY DID HERE--\r\n LINCOLN AT GETTYSBURG\r\n\r\nThough the number of Michigan men in the Spanish-American War was\r\nnaturally much smaller, the total mounted to very nearly four hundred,\r\nof whom eight lost their lives, including one member of the Rough\r\nRiders, Oliver B. Norton, '01_m_, killed by a shell at San Juan Hill. The\r\ncontingents from at least fifteen states included Michigan graduates,\r\nbut the greater number were to be found in the five Michigan volunteer\r\nregiments, particularly the 31st and 32nd, though there were a number in\r\nthe 33rd and 34th that formed with the 9th Massachusetts the Brigade\r\ncommanded by Brigadier-General Henry M. Duffield, '58-'59, which was one\r\nof the few volunteer units to see active service in Cuba.\r\n\r\nIn the Navy a large proportion of the Michigan men were members of the\r\nMichigan State Naval Brigade on the U.S.S. _Yosemite_, of which Dean\r\nM.E. Cooley, at that time Professor of Mechanical Engineering, was Chief\r\nEngineer. The _Yosemite_ was a converted yacht used as a scout and\r\nconvoy. Within a month after going into commission she was assigned to\r\nthe task of convoying some 800 marines on the _Panther_ to Guantanamo.\r\nIt happened that the first load was taken ashore on June 10 by one of\r\nthe boats of the _Yosemite_ and it is said the first American flag was\r\nplanted on Cuban soil by a University of Michigan member of the crew.\r\nLater in June the _Yosemite_ met a big Spanish mail steamer, the\r\n_Antonio Lopez_, with ammunition and supplies for San Juan and succeeded\r\nin beaching her under the fierce fire of the shore batteries and after\r\nattacks by three Spanish gunboats, which were twice driven into the\r\nharbor.\r\n\r\nIn addition to many graduates and students of the Medical Department\r\nattached to the different units, two members of the Faculty, Dean Victor\r\nC. Vaughan, Divisional Surgeon at Siboney, and Dr. C.B.G. de Nancrede,\r\nSurgeon of the 34th, saw active service in Cuba as Majors on the Medical\r\nStaff. Their courage and devotion to duty were mentioned in the\r\nSurgeon-General's report.\r\n\r\nMichigan was also represented in the war cabinet by its leader, William\r\nR. Day, '70, Secretary of State, while the Assistant Secretary of War, a\r\nmost important post in those exciting months, was George DeRue\r\nMeiklejohn, '80_l_. Judge Day was also President of the commission which\r\nnegotiated the peace at Paris after the war, with Cushman K. Davis, '57,\r\nchairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, as one of the other\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nAccording to the latest available records there were at least 12,000\r\nsons of the University of Michigan in service during the World War. Of\r\nthis number over 229 gave their lives for the principles for which\r\nAmerica was fighting. At the Seventy-fifth Commencement, which came the\r\nyear following the Armistice, the University's service flag, which hung\r\nin Hill Auditorium, revealed the fact that at that time the names were\r\nknown of 10,243 students and alumni in uniform. This figure mounted\r\nrapidly in subsequent months, though the difficulties of following the\r\ncareers of many former soldiers through the period of demobilization\r\nhave made it very difficult to obtain even an approximately correct\r\nestimate. This is particularly true in the case of thousands of students\r\nwho left the University during the years 1917 and 1918. An analysis of\r\nthe figures given on the service flag showed that of the total 7,669\r\nwere known to be actually in service while 2,747 were in the University,\r\nenrolled in the army and navy units of the Student Army Training Corps.\r\nAs these men were in uniform and regularly inducted in the two branches\r\nof service and would all have been sent overseas within a short time had\r\nthe war continued, their names must be included.\r\n\r\nSuch are the bare statistics of Michigan's part in the fight for the\r\nprinciples which have made America what she is. The war came slowly to\r\nthe University. During the years just preceding the entrance of the\r\nUnited States there was probably no part of the world as little touched\r\nby the actualities overseas as the mid-western portion of the United\r\nStates. The seaboard states felt it, in their commerce and other\r\ncontacts with Europe, far more than the vast central region, which had\r\nbeen favored with an unexampled wave of prosperity. So while America was\r\nat peace, the war spirit in the University was for the most part latent,\r\nfar more so than in many of the universities of the East, where the\r\nimplications and the realities of the war, which always come more\r\nvividly through personal relationships, led to more vigorous preparatory\r\nmeasures and many enlistments for service in the English, Canadian, and\r\nFrench armies.\r\n\r\nThe lessons the struggle on the Marne, in Flanders and Gallipoli was\r\nteaching were by no means unheeded, however, and a strong movement for\r\nmilitary training in the University developed as early as November,\r\n1914, when a petition signed by fifty members of the Faculty, including\r\nthe Deans of the Medical, Engineering, and Law Schools, for the\r\nestablishment of a military course in the University was presented to\r\nthe Regents. This had no immediate effect, however, and it was not until\r\nthe University Senate took similar action a year later that the movement\r\nwas really inaugurated. The opinion was as yet by no means unanimous in\r\nfavor of the plan, for a straw vote of the Faculty showed 85 for and 55\r\nagainst the general principle of military training for students, with a\r\nsomewhat smaller majority in favor of making it compulsory. A similar\r\nvote among the students showed 1,040 for the plan and 932 against it. In\r\nMarch, 1916, the Regents took favorable action on the project, though\r\nthe course was not compulsory. Several military companies and a naval\r\nreserve unit were organized immediately, and the students were\r\nencouraged to attend the summer camps at Plattsburg and Fort Sheridan.\r\n\r\nIt took over a year and the stimulus of the actual entry of the United\r\nStates into the war to bring to practical completion the plan of the\r\nRegents for voluntary training, with a course in military science\r\ninstituted under officers designated by the War Department. Co-operation\r\non the part of the Government, too, came slowly. There was great\r\ndifficulty in harmonizing the University system with the government plan\r\nfor college military training which was embodied in General Orders 49,\r\nestablishing a Reserve Officers' Training Corps. Many meetings took\r\nplace between officers detailed by the War Department and a committee,\r\ncomposed of the heads of various universities, of which President\r\nHutchins was a member, before a modification of the government program\r\nwas eventually secured. This made the prescribed course more elastic,\r\nand put military drill wholly or in part in summer camps. Inasmuch as\r\nthe students under this plan could not be appointed reserve officers\r\nwithout examinations, it was not strictly the R.O.T.C. as originally\r\ncontemplated by the Government, but it was a practical solution. As a\r\nmatter of fact most of these difficulties of organization vanished when\r\nthe United States entered the war, on April 6, 1917, in the general\r\nenthusiasm and eagerness to serve. The great practical question became a\r\nmatter of the detail of a competent army officer to the University.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the students lost no time; little companies could be seen\r\ndrilling everywhere on the streets. Three hundred students stayed over\r\nthe spring vacation and drilled for four hours every afternoon. By May\r\n315 men had been recommended for training camps, and 500 had left the\r\nUniversity to enlist. The Regents also authorized the circulation of the\r\n43,000 alumni and former students for the University Intelligence\r\nBureau, and 25,000 replies, giving the qualifications of each individual\r\nfor various forms of war service, were received. The Engineering College\r\nannounced seven preliminary courses in military science, while the\r\nMedical School, with almost the whole Faculty enlisted, foreseeing the\r\nneed of surgeons turned its whole force to training the upper classmen,\r\nand the Law School so arranged its programme that twelve hours a week\r\nwere given over to drill. The upper class medical, engineering, and\r\ndental students were also enlisted as reserves while completing their\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\nIt was not until October, 1917, that the Officers' Training Corps really\r\ngot under way, as a definite part of the curriculum. But once started\r\nthe response was overwhelming. Though the attendance in the University\r\nhad declined by 1,239, and the course was not compulsory, there were\r\n1,800 enrolled by the end of the first week. To introduce this great\r\nbody of embryo soldiers to the rudiments of military drill the\r\nGovernment sent just one officer, Lieut. George C. Mullen, who had\r\nretired after some years' service in the earlier Philippine campaigns.\r\nLater came two sergeants, and another officer, Lieut. Losey J. Williams.\r\nWith this slender force, and the aid of a company of Faculty men who\r\ndrilled every night in order to prepare themselves as advisors, or\r\n\"tactical officers\" to supervise the student company commanders and with\r\n300 old rifles, Michigan managed to \"carry on,\" maintaining the largest,\r\nthough owing to these difficulties probably not the most effective\r\nR.O.T.C. organization in the country. Nevertheless it served a very\r\nuseful purpose, as its continually dwindling ranks indicated; for the\r\nbetter men were leaving all the time for the numerous training camps\r\nwhich had been established in the meantime. Of the 800 who received\r\ncommissions after the first course at Camp Custer only 60 percent\r\nsurvived, but among these were all the candidates sent from the Michigan\r\nR.O.T.C., twenty-two of whom were included in the first hundred.\r\n\r\nThe University may also claim particular credit for the development of\r\ncourses in army stores, which were first instituted by Professor, later\r\nLieutenant-Colonel, Joseph A. Bursley, '99_e_. This course, which aimed\r\nto fit men for the ordnance and quartermasters departments, grew through\r\nsix successive increments every six weeks, to about 250 men, and proved\r\nso practical and effective that similar courses were installed in other\r\nuniversities. In the same manner similar short courses were established\r\nin the Engineering College for the training of mechanics, particularly\r\nin the maintenance and repair of gas engines. The first course of eight\r\nweeks began on April 15, 1917, and prepared 195 men for this important\r\nbranch of the service. A detachment of 700 men followed which included\r\n500 automobile repair men, 100 general mechanics, 60 gunsmiths, and 40\r\ncarpenters.\r\n\r\nThese men came as enlisted soldiers and were under the command of\r\nCaptain, later Major, R.H. Durkee. Five old residences belonging to the\r\nUniversity were transformed into barracks, while the still far from\r\ncompleted Union was used as a mess hall. The laboratory facilities of\r\nthe Engineering College naturally proved inadequate for so large a\r\nnumber, and temporary buildings sprang up rapidly in every open space\r\nnearby, erected by the men in the detachments. In addition to the\r\ntechnical training given these men, who were not, however, enrolled as\r\nuniversity students, various special courses were given in war aims\r\nwhich proved of great value in furthering morale. This whole effort\r\nproved so effective that the Government desired to make a contract for\r\nthe training of 2,800 men from October, 1918, through July, 1919; but\r\nthis was more than the University could care for, though it agreed to\r\ntake 1,140, including 60 telephone linemen, and 600 telephone\r\nelectricians.\r\n\r\nThe next step came in the establishment of the Students' Army Training\r\nCorps in the fall of 1918. This was designed to correct the weaknesses,\r\nrevealed under the stress of war-time conditions, in the old R.O.T.C.,\r\nwhich in most universities did not furnish really effective military\r\ntraining for the emergency, particularly in the matter of discipline.\r\nThe passing of the draft law also threatened the very existence of many\r\nof the private colleges and the plan to carry on university work and\r\nmilitary training, side by side, while the students were actually\r\ninducted and under strict military discipline, seemed an ideal solution\r\nof a most threatening problem. Michigan, therefore, in common with every\r\nother college and university which could muster the necessary one\r\nhundred students, became in effect a military academy with the opening\r\nof the University in October, 1918, though of course there were many\r\nstudents not enrolled in the S.A.T.C., particularly the women, and the\r\nmedical, engineering, and dental reserves who were completing their\r\ncourses. The total S.A.T.C. enlistment was 2,727, of whom 2,151 were\r\nenrolled in the Army, and 586 in the Naval Training Corps; these were\r\nentered as regular students in the University, while 2,247 more in\r\nSection B, the army mechanics course, were not considered University\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nThus with the largest S.A.T.C. enrolment of any university in the\r\ncountry, Michigan gladly devoted all her resources to the one supreme\r\naim of training soldiers. Practically every fraternity house was turned\r\nover to the War Department as a barracks; the mysterious Greek letters\r\nwere dropped and henceforth they were known simply by number--officially\r\nat least. The sum of $260,000 was borrowed from the State War Board to\r\nhasten the completion of the Union sufficiently to serve as a mess hall\r\nand kitchen, and this together with a temporary building erected\r\nalongside accommodated some 3,650 men. The Union also furnished sleeping\r\nquarters for 800 student soldiers. The fact that Michigan had a building\r\nso well adapted to the needs of the new situation was perhaps the\r\nprincipal factor in enabling the University to enter upon the programme\r\nso extensively. Dean Mortimer E. Cooley of the Engineering College was\r\nmade Regional Educational Director with the work in all the colleges and\r\nuniversities in Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan under his charge, while\r\nsome forty army officers, many of them recent graduates of training\r\ncamps, were detailed to the University as officers in charge.\r\n\r\nDifficulties arose everywhere from the very first, however. The plan,\r\nwhich was not definitely approved by the War Department until a month\r\nbefore the opening of the colleges, was naturally not carefully worked\r\nout in detail. But this was a minor matter compared with a more serious\r\ndefect in the general scheme. This was the lack of competent military\r\nofficers, men with sufficient vision to co-operate effectively with the\r\nuniversities. The officers detailed were for the most part retired from\r\nactive service, or recent recruits from training camps, and it was the\r\nexaggerated emphasis of things military on the part of the latter class\r\nthat was largely responsible for the difficulty, noticeable from the\r\nvery first, of maintaining any semblance of university work. The scheme\r\nprovided for 42 hours of class work and study (14 hours of recitation\r\nwith 28 hours of preparation) and only 13 hours of military drill; but\r\nthe almost universal experience was that the military officers wholly\r\nmisinterpreted the object of the plan and, with their strict control\r\nover their men, were able to discount, almost completely in some cases,\r\nthe educational side of the programme. To add to the confusion, the\r\nonset of the influenza epidemic at just this time made the task of\r\nbringing order out of chaos almost impossible. Nevertheless, by the time\r\nthe end came with the signing of the Armistice, measures were under way\r\nwhich might have saved the situation by curbing the complete ascendancy\r\nof the military officers, and restoring the scheme to its original\r\nessentially educational policy; for, in the original plan, the military\r\nfeatures were to go only so far as to enable the authorities to\r\nselect the best men for further intensive training at the officers'\r\ncamps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STUDENTS' ARMY TRAINING CORPS\r\nDrawn up before the Michigan Union (fall of 1918)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE FOURTEEN-INCH NAVAL GUNS IN FRANCE\r\nWhose crews were largely composed of the Michigan Naval Volunteers]\r\n\r\nThis broad military programme was by no means confined to the students,\r\nas the whole curriculum of the University was necessarily almost wholly\r\nsubordinated to the new scheme. Many courses not included in the outline\r\nprescribed by the Government, such as the classics, fine arts, and\r\nphilosophy, were practically discontinued or given in a limited form to\r\nthe few men not in service and the women students in the University.\r\nMany members of the Faculty abandoned their own subjects entirely and\r\nconfined their work to the courses on war issues, which had come to form\r\nan important part of the new curriculum, or to elementary work in modern\r\nlanguages, especially French; German being for the most part anathema.\r\nThis was a mistake; as one government inspector, himself a teacher of\r\nEnglish, was accustomed to say emphatically, German was going to be\r\nneeded even more than French; and so it turned out in the later days of\r\nthe occupation of Germany. Nevertheless the decline of interest in the\r\nGerman language and literature, which had long been so carefully\r\ncultivated, as we can see now, by the German government, is one of the\r\npermanent results of the war; while there has been a corresponding\r\nincrease in the study of French and Spanish.\r\n\r\nThroughout this period, the women of the University were far from\r\npassive spectators. Special courses in household economics, conservation\r\nof food, French, journalism, and publicity and the principles of\r\ncensorship, as well as a course in drafting in the Engineering College\r\nwere provided for them. The women of the Faculty and town threw\r\nthemselves indefatigably into Red Cross service, with the presidential\r\nresidence on the Campus, known as Angell House, as one of the principal\r\nheadquarters. A Hostess House was also maintained in the parlors of\r\nBarbour Gymnasium for the families and sweethearts of men in the\r\ntraining detachments, while at one time the great floor of Waterman\r\nGymnasium was used as a barracks. With the inauguration of the S.A.T.C.,\r\nAlumni Memorial Hall was taken over as a Hostess House and maintained\r\nentirely by Ann Arbor women. Likewise during the worst of the influenza\r\nepidemic, the terrors of which were multiplied by the constant arrival\r\nof stricken men in new detachments, and the lack of adequate hospital\r\nfacilities for such an unforeseen emergency, the women gave themselves,\r\nand in some cases their homes, to the cause, and helped to save many\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nThus the University gave itself over unreservedly to winning the war. No\r\none can measure how great actually and potentially that service was. But\r\nMichigan's contribution was far from resting there. Thousands of her\r\nsons, alumni and students, were in service, a goodly proportion with the\r\nforces in France and elsewhere and with the Navy, while at least 229 are\r\nto be represented by a gold star on the University's great service flag.\r\n\r\nThough Michigan officially remained aloof from active participation in\r\nthe issues of the struggle before America entered it, she had many\r\nrepresentatives in the fighting ranks. Professor Rene Talamon, of the\r\nFrench Department, who was spending his honeymoon in France, entered the\r\nFrench Army in 1914 and saw active service in all the great earlier\r\nbattles, winning the Croix de Guerre on the field. He remained in\r\nuniform throughout the four years and completed his record by acting as\r\ninterpreter at the Peace Conference. Frederic W. Zinn, '14_e_ a student\r\njust graduated, was of that immortal company of Americans in the French\r\nForeign Legion, whose exploits have so often been told, and was one of\r\nthe twelve survivors of a section of sixty. He was severely wounded in\r\nthe Champagne offensive and subsequently entered the French and later\r\nthe American Aviation Services. There were also many Michigan men\r\nscattered through the British and Canadian forces, and at least one,\r\nStanley J. Schooley, _e_'09-'12, was with the Anzacs to the end at\r\nGallipoli. George B.F. Monk, '13_d_, a Lieutenant in the Royal\r\nWarwickshires, was killed in Flanders, December 18, 1914, while another\r\ndental graduate, John Austen Ogden, '04_d_, was killed in France. Lieut.\r\nThomas C. Bechraft, '09_l_, who enlisted with the Canadians, was killed\r\nby a sniper at the great British attack on Vimy Ridge, April 4,\r\n1917;--one wonders whether he knew then that America had entered the\r\nwar; and Theodore Harvey Clark, '14, died from sunstroke, September 9,\r\n1917, while serving with the Y.M.C.A. in Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\nOf the little company of Americans in the French ambulance service,\r\namong whom were a number of former students of the University, were the\r\ntwo Hall brothers, sons of Dr. Louis P. Hall, '89_d_, Professor of\r\nDentistry in the University. Richard Nelville Hall, '11-'12, who later\r\nwas graduated from Dartmouth, was killed on Christmas morning, 1915,\r\nwhen his car was struck by a stray shell, the first American to be\r\nkilled in the ambulance service. His brother Louis P. Hall, Dartmouth,\r\n'12, Michigan, '14_e_, later became a lieutenant in the French army, and\r\neventually captain in the American Expeditionary Forces.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that Michigan's share in the war did not await the\r\nentry of America among the Allies, although it was not until the forces\r\nof the country were definitely enlisted that her real contribution, in\r\nmen and services, was made. With the opening of the great training\r\ncamps, the alumni, particularly those of more recent years, as well as\r\nthe students of the University volunteered literally in thousands, and\r\nMichigan was soon represented by men and officers in every branch of the\r\nservice. They were in the first contingent of the expeditionary forces,\r\nthe Rainbow Division, and figured prominently in the earliest fighting\r\nabout the St. Mihiel salient, at Cantigny, and later with the Marines at\r\nBelleau Wood. Many were of course held in America, to their disgust, to\r\ntrain the new levies under the draft law, while others were assigned\r\nparticular duties for which their special training had fitted them. Thus\r\nwe find Michigan represented everywhere in the Medical and Dental Corps,\r\nthe early engineering battalions, the rapidly evolving work of the\r\nsignal corps, the military intelligence and censorship divisions, gas\r\nwarfare and gas defense, publicity, and perhaps above all, the aviation\r\nservice, for which the young college man seemed peculiarly fitted. There\r\nwere several Michigan men among the first aviation sections in France;\r\nseveral were killed and others captured in early combats. The arrival of\r\nthe later contingents brought Michigan men with every division; they\r\nwere everywhere in the Argonne battle, they were with the famous \"lost\r\nbattalion,\" and with the American forces included in the British\r\nsectors, as well as among the engineers who helped to stop the gap after\r\nthe disaster to the Fifth British Army.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking contribution Michigan made towards winning the\r\nwar was in manning the big naval guns which did more than any one thing\r\nto cut the German lines of communication through the gap by Sedan\r\nbetween Longuyon and Montmedy. It is not too much to say that it was the\r\nwork of these guns, in the hands of the men and officers recruited\r\nlargely from the two naval divisions who left the University in the\r\nspring of 1917, that formed one of the great arguments which led to the\r\nArmistice of November 11. These two divisions of about seventy men each\r\nwere organized in the fall of 1916, and with the entry of the United\r\nStates in the war were immediately mustered into service with Professors\r\nJ.R. Hayden of the Department of Political Science and Orange J. McNiel\r\nof the Engineering College as the commanding officers. For some time\r\nthey were held in Ann Arbor, where they were quartered in the Gymnasium,\r\nlater going to the Great Lakes Training Station for further preparation.\r\n\r\nWithin a short time they were assigned to the various rifle ranges which\r\nwere being established up and down the Atlantic coast by Major Harllee\r\nof the Marine Corps and given intensive training in gunnery. So well did\r\nthey show up in this specialized task, for intensive training in\r\nmarksmanship was one of the Navy's great needs, that little squads of\r\nthe men were sent everywhere to install and open up new ranges.\r\nMeanwhile the need of big guns on the French front was becoming more and\r\nmore apparent and one officer, Captain, and later Admiral, Plunkett\r\nbethought him of a number of great 14-inch navy guns which were not in\r\nuse. He conceived the idea of mounting these on railway carriages and\r\nmaking great mobile batteries of them. At first he was laughed at; it\r\nwas impossible to make heavy enough trucks to carry such a weight; and\r\nthen, where were the expert men to man them? He replied that he knew\r\nwhere he could get the men and called in experts to design the\r\ncarriages. The result was that in just fifty days the first gun was\r\nsuccessfully fired from the railway mounting at the proving ground at\r\nSandy Hook, by the Michigan Naval Volunteers. When the guns were\r\nshipped to France all the Michigan men available were sent with them and\r\nformed the effective nucleus of every crew. They wore the marine uniform\r\nwith naval insignia and were under naval discipline throughout; they\r\nwent \"fore\" and \"aft\" on the great trains which accompanied each gun,\r\npointed their pieces to \"port\" and \"starboard\" and were rated according\r\nto navy ranking.\r\n\r\nTheir great task came when the guns with their equipment first landed at\r\nSt. Nazaire. Not only was it necessary to assemble the guns, but also\r\nthe locomotives and accompanying armored cars. All of this work was done\r\nby the men of the two units as officers and petty officers. When these\r\nguns finally got into action, they outranged every battery on any front\r\nand, striking at the German railway lines of communication, now from\r\nthis point and then that, they threw the whole \"neck of the bottle\"\r\ntoward which the American forces were driving into hopeless confusion.\r\nOf the men in these two battalions over sixty percent received\r\ncommissions, and of the others, almost all held high ratings as petty\r\nofficers with responsibilities ordinarily only assumed by commissioned\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nWith so great a number of Michigan men with the expeditionary forces,\r\nthe University was particularly interested in their welfare while \"over\r\nthere.\" From the first Michigan took a prominent part in the\r\nestablishment of the American University Union in Paris, of which\r\nPresident Hutchins was one of the first Board of Trustees. Professor\r\nCharles B. Vibbert, '04, of the Department of Philosophy was appointed\r\nDirector of the Michigan Bureau by President Hutchins and was made one\r\nof the Executive Committee in Paris. Here he rendered most effective\r\nservice to the hundreds of Michigan men who used the club house, a\r\nlarge hotel in the heart of Paris, as their headquarters. He was also\r\nassigned as his special duty, the promotion of friendly relations\r\nbetween the Americans and the French people of Paris, and so successful\r\nwas he in this task that he was awarded the Legion of Honor by the\r\nFrench government. After the end of the demobilization period he\r\nremained in Paris for a time as Director of a permanent Union which\r\nsucceeded the war organization. Two other representatives of the\r\nUniversity, Mr. Warren J. Vinton, '11, for some time Professor Vibbert's\r\nassistant, and Assistant Professor Philip E. Bursley, '02, one of the\r\ngeneral secretaries, were on the Union's staff.\r\n\r\nNo review of Michigan's record in the war would be complete without a\r\nword as to the share of the Faculty. As never before this was a war of\r\nscientists and technically trained men. There was hardly a subject\r\ntaught in the University which did not fit in somewhere, while the work\r\nof such departments as chemistry, physics, astronomy, mathematics, and\r\nthe various branches of engineering, to say nothing of the Schools of\r\nMedicine and the Colleges of Dentistry and Pharmacy, proved absolutely\r\nindispensable. Long before this country entered the war Dean M.E. Cooley\r\nhad offered his services to the Government, when the crisis which he and\r\nmany others foresaw, should come.\r\n\r\nIn all there were 162 members of the Faculty in various forms of war\r\nservice, a large proportion of them in uniform. Among those to whom were\r\nassigned particularly noteworthy tasks were Dean Victor C. Vaughan,\r\n'78_m_, of the Medical Advisory Board of the Council of National Defense\r\nand later Colonel on the staff of the Surgeon-General in Washington,\r\nwhere was also Dr. Walter R. Parker, '88_e_, Professor of\r\nOphthalmology, who as Lieutenant-Colonel in the Medical Corps had charge\r\nof head surgery. Dr. Udo J. Wile, Professor of Dermatology, Major in the\r\nMedical Corps, was among the earliest medical officers abroad, where he\r\nwas in charge of the first American hospital in England, near Liverpool.\r\n\r\nIn the Literary College, among the many who early entered service were\r\nJesse S. Reeves, Professor of Political Science, who entered the\r\nAviation Service and later the Judge Advocates' Department, holding the\r\nrank of major; Peter Field, Associate Professor of Mathematics, who, as\r\nMajor in the Ordnance Department, had charge of the tests and ballistic\r\ncomputations, as well as serving as armament officer, at the Sandy Hook\r\nproving grounds; Moses Gomberg, '90, Professor of Organic Chemistry, who\r\nas Major in the Ordnance Service made valuable investigations, and\r\nProfessor H.R. Cross of the Department of Fine Arts, who held an\r\nimportant post with the Red Cross in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe men of technical training of the Engineering Faculty were especially\r\nin demand and practically every man in one Department, that of Chemical\r\nEngineering was in service. Alfred H. White, '93, Professor of Chemical\r\nEngineering, became Lieutenant-Colonel in charge of the construction of\r\nthe great government nitrate plants; Walter T. Fishleigh, '02, '06_e_,\r\nAssociate Professor of Automobile Engineering, as Lieutenant-Colonel,\r\nwas, with Major Gordon Stoner, '04, '06_l_, Professor of Law in the\r\nUniversity, in charge of the design and purchase of all the ambulances\r\nfor the Medical Corps. Lieutenant-Colonel William C. Hoad, Professor of\r\nSanitary Engineering, took charge of the sanitation of the big training\r\ncamps.\r\n\r\nMany other members of the Faculty, in civilian capacities, gave no less\r\nvaluable services to the Government. Professor Herbert C. Sadler, head\r\nof the Department of Marine Engineering, became chief of the department\r\nof ship design of the Emergency Fleet Corporation; James W. Glover,\r\nProfessor of Mathematics and Insurance, was a member of the War Risk\r\nBoard; Dr. G. Carl Huber, '87_m_, Professor of Anatomy, carried on an\r\nextended series of investigations of the peripheral nerves, with the\r\nassistance of medical officers detailed to his laboratory by the\r\nSurgeon-General; David Friday, '08, Professor of Economics, was\r\nStatistical Advisor to the Treasury Department and later the Telephone\r\nand Telegraph Administration, while Dean Henry M. Bates, '90, of the Law\r\nSchool, and Professor H.C. Adams, head of the Department of Economics,\r\nalso at various times acted in advisory capacities at Washington.\r\nFrancis L. D. Goodrich, '03, was also Reference Librarian at the\r\nUniversity of the American Expeditionary Force at Beaune, France.\r\n\r\nWith the end of the war every effort was made to bring the University\r\nback to normal conditions as soon as possible. The speedy demobilization\r\nof the S.A.T.C. made advisable the abandonment of the plan of a year of\r\nfour quarters and the semester system was restored by February. The\r\nmembers of the Faculty gradually returned during the year, and by the\r\nfall of 1919 everything was as usual, save for the extraordinary\r\nenrolment, which totaled 8,057 students on the Campus during the year,\r\nwith a grand total of 9,401 in all, including the Summer Session. This\r\nincrease was largely due to the men returning from service to finish\r\ntheir abandoned work, or to take up a belated University course. Eighty\r\nmen who had been wounded were sent by the Government Rehabilitation\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\nSuch an unprecedented number of students, which was larger by 1,500 than\r\never before, naturally brought with it many difficult problems,\r\nparticularly in living accommodations. These difficulties were\r\naggravated by the sharp rise in room rent and board, which brought\r\nhardship in many cases and was only adjusted by the prompt action of the\r\nRooming Bureau of the Michigan Union, which made a complete survey of\r\nthe city and brought pressure to bear in cases of outrageous\r\nprofiteering. Equally difficult proved the question of teachers and\r\nclass rooms in the University. This was only solved after many new\r\ninstructors were engaged, a difficult matter at so late a period in the\r\nyear, and the creation of many emergency class rooms. Special credits\r\nwere also given the men returning from service, in some cases as high as\r\nfifteen hours, equaling a semester's work, in recognition of their\r\nspecial war-time experience and training and the new earnestness and\r\nappreciation of what a university education meant, with which they\r\nreturned to their class rooms and laboratories.\r\n\r\nUniversity life speedily returned to its accustomed channels; only the\r\nservice buttons, the modest ribbons in lapels, and khaki and blue\r\novercoats remained to suggest the Campus of a year before. So great was\r\nthe reaction from things military that the re-establishment of the\r\nR.O.T.C. in modified form came slowly. Eventually about 180 men, largely\r\nfrom the freshmen and sophomore classes, were enrolled in the artillery\r\nand signal service units under the two officers detailed to the\r\nUniversity, Captain Robert Arthur and Captain John P. Lucas, who held\r\nthe temporary rank of Lieutenant-Colonels in France. These courses\r\npromise much for the future, however, though during the University year\r\nthe work is confined to technical training, with the drill to come in\r\nthe annual summer camps which every man enrolled must attend. Not only\r\nwill men be continually in training as reserve officers, effective at\r\nonce in an emergency, but also they will form a nucleus around which a\r\nreally effective training corps for the general student body can be\r\nbuilt at any time when the necessity arises. If this work develops as it\r\nshould, and comes to form an integral part of university life, we shall\r\nhave profited by one of the lessons of the Great War, and with similar\r\ncourses installed in all our great educational centers, America will be\r\nready, as she was not in 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE ALUMNI OF THE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\n\r\nJust at present Michigan probably has the largest body of alumni of any\r\nuniversity in the country. The total number of graduates in January,\r\n1920, was 34,817, of whom 28,901 were living, while the total of\r\ngraduates and former students was 60,463. Of this number 11,420 were\r\nknown to be deceased. The number of addresses on the University lists at\r\nthat time was 43,783. There are several reasons for this large alumni\r\nbody. In the first place few universities have many living graduates of\r\nthe classes which graduated before 1850; Michigan's oldest graduates at\r\npresent are George W. Carter, '53_m_, of Boulder, Colorado, and John E.\r\nClark, '56, Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Yale. After her first\r\nfew years Michigan had as many students enrolled as most of the other\r\ninstitutions of that time, while the extraordinary growth of the Medical\r\nand Law Schools in the period just after the Civil War probably gave her\r\nthe largest number of students in any university.\r\n\r\nThis, with the great increase which has come to all universities and\r\nparticularly the state institutions within the last twenty years or so,\r\nhas given Michigan an unusually large body of alumni. There are,\r\nhowever, a number of universities, notably Columbia, California, and\r\nChicago, which have had a very large enrolment of late years, and it is\r\nnot unlikely that within a few years their alumni catalogues will\r\ncontain more names than Michigan's. It may be remarked in connection\r\nwith the relatively large proportion of those who have not received\r\ndegrees, about 42 percent of the total, that this number has been\r\nincreased by war-time conditions, and that judging from former records\r\nit is about ten percent higher than in more normal times.\r\n\r\nMichigan has always taken an especial pride in the fact that, although a\r\nstate university, her student body has been recruited almost as much\r\nfrom the rest of the country as from Michigan; while there has always\r\nbeen a not inconsiderable proportion of students from foreign countries.\r\nThis national enrolment has had a broadening and stimulating effect upon\r\nthe student body and has given the University a powerful influence\r\nthroughout the country. Her graduates are to be found in every state in\r\nthe Union, though they are probably proportionately stronger in the\r\nstates west of the Mississippi, whose development came just in time to\r\nattract the enterprising and vigorous youth who had his future to make\r\nand gladly seized the opportunity to grow up with the new country.\r\nMichigan, with her low tuition charges, even for non-residents, and her\r\nequally moderate cost of living, has been also pre-eminently a college\r\nfor students of limited means. Thus, while there are many men of wealth\r\namong her alumni, they are almost all men who have made their own way,\r\nand have a position in their communities corresponding to their energy\r\nand proved ability.\r\n\r\nFor some years the attendance from Michigan, though it is somewhat\r\ngreater now, has averaged 55 percent. This is unusually significant when\r\nthe great extent of the State is considered, particularly since most of\r\nthe students from the Northern Peninsula usually pass through three\r\nother states to reach Ann Arbor. Not less worthy of note is the fact\r\nthat only about 39 percent of the graduates of the University live\r\nwithin the State, proof positive that Michigan, in sending her students\r\nabroad, is performing a great service for the country. The percentages\r\nof alumni in other states is also not without interest, for while the\r\nneighboring states of Illinois and Ohio claim about 8 percent and\r\nIndiana 3.7 percent, New York has 6 percent of Michigan's graduates,\r\nwhile Pennsylvania has 3.5 percent, and California 3.2 percent. About\r\n2.5 percent of Michigan's former students, or 1,093, live in foreign\r\ncountries. Of these 318 are in Canada, 126 in China, 62 in Great\r\nBritain, 61 in South America, 51 in Africa, and 46 in Japan. Of the\r\nUnited States dependencies, 66 are in Porto Rico, 54 in the Philippines,\r\nand 17 in Alaska. These figures might easily be increased were the\r\naddresses of all alumni found, as there are, no doubt, a large number of\r\n\"unknowns\" in foreign countries. Of the total number of graduates and\r\nforeign students for whom the University has addresses, 36,492 are men\r\nand 7,291 are women.\r\n\r\nThis great body of alumni is in itself a powerful asset for the\r\nUniversity; but the active interest and spirit of co-operation of the\r\nindividual alumnus ordinarily needs a certain stimulus. This is supplied\r\nthrough the organization of the graduates into a general Alumni\r\nAssociation, as well as into local associations in most of the larger\r\ncities, and also through the organization of the various classes. This\r\ngeneral scheme is followed in almost every American university, and\r\nforms one of the most significant of present-day developments. For the\r\nmost part it is a comparatively recent evolution. Though the graduates\r\nof the earlier American colleges had a certain influence on the policies\r\nand growth of their institutions, it is only within the last twenty-five\r\nyears that these associations have become a factor of recognized\r\nimportance in every university. In fact this development is so recent\r\nthat its significance is not sufficiently realized, least of all\r\nperhaps by the alumni themselves; though the college president is apt to\r\nbe very alive to the importance of the alumni in university affairs.\r\n\r\nThe desire to perpetuate college friendships and to revive memories of\r\ncollege days was undoubtedly the underlying motive which first brought\r\nthe former students together in these organizations; and not a few\r\nassociations have progressed no farther in their activities. This is as\r\ntrue among Michigan alumni clubs as elsewhere. But as university\r\nofficers came to recognize other possibilities in these associations,\r\nefforts were made to secure their co-operation in many matters and\r\nespecially financial assistance, in the establishment of funds for\r\nvarious purposes, the erection of new buildings and providing for\r\ncertain types of equipment which might not properly come from the\r\nordinary channels of college and university income. The Michigan Union,\r\nHill Auditorium, the women's dormitories, and the Clements Library of\r\nAmericana perhaps best illustrate this type of alumni support.\r\n\r\nWhile in most cases the impetus toward this active co-operation and\r\nsupport on the part of the alumni came from the institution, in recent\r\nyears the alumni have tended more and more to organize, not as an\r\nadjunct of the university administration, but as a body designed to\r\nformulate independent alumni opinion, and to make intelligent graduate\r\nsentiment really effective for the good of the institution. With this\r\nnew phase of alumni activity came new elements--particularly the alumni\r\nsecretary, maintained by the graduate body, the alumni journal, and the\r\nalumni council.\r\n\r\nThis organization of college graduates is distinctly an American\r\ninstitution. There is little to correspond in Continental universities,\r\nwhere they do not even have a real equivalent to our word \"alumni.\" In\r\nGreat Britain, the graduates of the larger institutions have some voice\r\nin the policies of their universities and, in the case of the Scottish\r\nuniversities, they elect representatives on the governing body, as well\r\nas the chancellor and a representative in Parliament. But the lists of\r\nalumni are kept up only for what are practically political purposes, and\r\nsuch developments as local alumni clubs, or class reunions, are unknown;\r\nwhile there is ordinarily small effort made to secure financial support.\r\n\r\nAlumni co-operation has progressed so rapidly within the last\r\nquarter-century,--the period covering the life of the Association at\r\nMichigan under its present form,--that we are apt to forget how recent\r\nis this movement in American universities. To glance through the average\r\ncollege or university history one would imagine these associations\r\nsprang full-armed, with no preliminary throes of organization. Suddenly\r\nwe find the alumni asserting their desires in some important matter and\r\nthenceforth their voice has a recognized place in university councils.\r\nIt is quite obvious that the significance of this movement among college\r\ngraduates was not recognized for a long time. Everywhere the graduates\r\nwere slow in finding themselves; and it is safe to say that an efficient\r\nalumni sentiment was almost unknown until within the last fifty years.\r\nBut the seeds had been sown. Though Yale began her remarkable\r\norganization by classes as far back as 1792, and others may have\r\nfollowed her example, records of any further efforts in this direction\r\nare difficult to find until many years later.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at a general alumni organization seems to have been a\r\nmeeting of the alumni at Williams College at Commencement time, in 1821,\r\nto organize a Society of Alumni. The purpose of the proposed\r\nassociation was set forth in the following words:\r\n\r\n     The meeting is notified at the request of a number of gentlemen,\r\n     educated at this institution, who are desirous that the true state\r\n     of the college be known to the alumni, and that the influence and\r\n     patronage of those it has educated may be united for its support,\r\n     protection, and improvement.\r\n\r\nThis does not seem an unsatisfactory definition of the fundamental\r\nobject of an alumni body of the present day. Seventeen years later a\r\nSociety of Alumni was organized at the University of Virginia, where,\r\nwith perhaps a characteristic Southern emphasis on the social side of\r\nhuman relationships, the committee was instructed,--\r\n\r\n     to invite the alumni to form a permanent society, to offer to\r\n     graduates an inducement to revisit the seat of their youthful\r\n     studies and to give new life to disinterested friendships found in\r\n     student days.\r\n\r\nOther universities soon followed with similar organizations. Harvard's\r\nAlumni Association was established in 1840; Bowdoin and Amhert came at\r\nabout the same time, while the first alumni association at Columbia was\r\nfounded in 1854. In the West an alumni association was started at Miami\r\nas early as 1832. The first years of these organizations were apparently\r\na period of struggle, but the spirit that they represented grew, and\r\neventually they made alumni influence everywhere effective to a greater\r\nor less degree, with the end not yet.\r\n\r\nAt Michigan, alumni organization has had a history similar to that in\r\nmany other institutions. The University published a list of the first\r\nfour classes as far back as 1848, but the alumni did not become a\r\nunited body until 1860, fifteen years after the first class was\r\ngraduated. This first association was characterized as \"somewhat\r\ninformal in its nature,\" but the usual statement of the object was\r\nforthcoming. According to the preamble of the constitution these were,--\r\n\r\n     the improvement of its members, the perpetuation of pleasant\r\n     associations, the promotion of the interests of the University, and\r\n     through that of the interests of higher education in general.\r\n\r\nThis Association was superseded in June, 1875, by an incorporated\r\norganization, the \"Society of the Alumni of the University of Michigan,\"\r\nin which, notwithstanding its general name, membership was restricted to\r\ngraduates of the collegiate department. A similar association of the Law\r\nSchool was formed in 1871 and before many years all the departments had\r\nsimilar bodies. But the interest taken was more or less perfunctory, and\r\nin 1897 a consolidation of all the departmental organizations was\r\neffected, resulting in the present Alumni Association of the University\r\nof Michigan, with ex-Regent Levi L. Barbour, '63, '65_l_, as its first\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded in June, 1899, by William E. Quinby, '58, of Detroit,\r\nwho was followed in turn the next year by Regent W.J. Cocker, '69. Judge\r\nVictor H. Lane, '74_e_, '78_l_, Fletcher Professor of Law, was elected\r\nPresident in 1901, and so effectively has he served the interests of the\r\nalumni that he has been continued in that office for the past twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nTwo important steps were taken by the new Association immediately upon\r\nits consolidation in 1897. The first was the appointment of a General\r\nSecretary to devote his whole time to furthering the interests of the\r\nalumni organization. Ralph H. McAllister, a former member of the law\r\nclass of '89, was first elected to this position, but was succeeded in\r\nJanuary, 1898, by James H. Prentiss, '96, who was followed three years\r\nlater by Shirley W. Smith, '97, at present Secretary of the University.\r\nThe present Alumni Secretary, Wilfred B. Shaw, '04, was appointed in\r\nOctober, 1904. The purchase of the graduate journal, _The Michigan\r\nAlumnus_, established in 1894 by Alvick A. Pearson, '94, was another\r\nsignificant step. The _Alumnus_ is one of the oldest graduate\r\npublications in the country, with the _Yale Alumni Weekly_, established\r\nin 1891, and the _Harvard Graduates' Magazine_, a quarterly, which\r\nappeared a year later, its only predecessors. Both of these journals are\r\npublished by private corporations, as was the _Alumnus_ at first. In\r\nthus creating an officer whose sole responsibility was to the alumni\r\nbody and in maintaining an official alumni publication, Michigan became\r\na pioneer among Western universities, and was only preceded in the East\r\nby Pennsylvania, whose alumni organization had established her _Alumni\r\nRegister_ and appointed an alumni secretary in 1895.\r\n\r\nThe plan of organization of the Alumni Association at Michigan is very\r\nsimple. The entire responsibility for the affairs of the Association\r\nrests with a board of seven directors (originally but five), who elect\r\nthe officers of the Association from among their own number. Two\r\ndirectors are ordinarily elected every year at the annual alumni\r\nmeeting, held during the Commencement season, at which any alumnus is\r\nentitled to a vote. The income of the Association, except for a grant of\r\n$600 a year from the University for advertising, arises entirely from\r\nthe _Alumnus_, which at present has a list of over 7,000 subscribers,\r\nwho are considered as constituting the official membership of the\r\nAssociation. This membership is in two forms, annual members and some\r\n1,500 life members, whose thirty-five dollar fees have resulted in an\r\nendowment fund at present amounting to over $38,000, the income from\r\nwhich is used for current expenses.\r\n\r\nSince its establishment the _Alumnus_ has grown steadily in influence,\r\nand may now be regarded, in some measure at least, as the official\r\nUniversity publication. Limited as it is by the necessity of pleasing a\r\nconstituency widely varied in age and interests, it nevertheless makes\r\nit possible for a large proportion of Michigan's graduates to maintain\r\nan effective and intelligent interest in the University.\r\n\r\nBut the work of the Association and its officers has not stopped with\r\nthe _Alumnus_. The local alumni bodies and the class organizations form\r\nimportant links between the graduate and his alma mater, and the\r\nsentimental ties, as well as the altruistic spirit engendered by these\r\nassociations have a vital significance for the individual graduate and\r\nfor the University. Practically every class that leaves the University\r\nis organized for the purpose of perpetuating its college associations\r\nand many of the classes, particularly the earlier ones, have published\r\nextensive class-books and directories. Every effort is made to return to\r\nthe University for reunions at stated periods, especially on the\r\ntwenty-five and fifty year anniversaries. For some years also many\r\nclasses have followed a plan which brings four classes that were in\r\ncollege together back for a reunion at the same time. The value of these\r\nannual home-comings has always been emphasized by the Alumni\r\nAssociation, and so successful has it been in making the reunion season\r\ninteresting and stimulating that the graduates return in great numbers,\r\nsometimes in a carnival spirit, and sometimes, as during the recent war\r\nyears, with a sense of consecration and devotion. Thus it was easy to\r\npass from the gay fun of a burlesque commencement in Hill Auditorium,\r\nwhich was the feature of one reunion season, to the commemoration of Dr.\r\nAngell's life and services in 1916, and the great patriotic meetings of\r\n1918 and 1919, which struck the deepest chords of alumni sentiment.\r\n\r\nNo less effective in their own field are the many local alumni clubs in\r\nall the large cities throughout the country. This movement toward\r\nforming local bodies began in Detroit in 1869, and quickly spread, so\r\nthat by 1876 the Michigan graduates as far west as San Francisco were\r\norganized. While the primary reason for the existence of these clubs is\r\nthe maintenance of the social and sentimental ties inspired by the\r\ncommon love of their members for the University, stimulated usually by\r\nan annual dinner and, in many cities, by weekly or monthly luncheons,\r\nthey have begun to discover means more positive and useful to justify\r\ntheir existence. From a vague, if none the less real, feeling of loyalty\r\nto the University it is an easy step to more aggressive measures. Thus\r\nwe find the local bodies interesting themselves actively in the\r\nUniversity's affairs, organizing subscription campaigns for the Union,\r\nraising funds for fellowships, and sending picked students to the\r\nUniversity, interesting themselves in the ever-present athletic\r\nproblems, and welcoming the President and other representatives from the\r\nFaculties who come to tell them what their alma mater is accomplishing.\r\nMore than this, some associations are perceiving broader implications in\r\ntheir organization as representative college men and women,--for the\r\nalumnae, too, have very active clubs,--and are seeking opportunities for\r\ncivic and social service in their communities. At present Michigan has\r\nnearly one hundred of these local organizations of alumni which may be\r\nconsidered active, while there are many more who only need to have some\r\ntask set before them to bring them into an active and aggressive\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIt is only natural that, with this increasing participation of the\r\nalumni in university affairs, there should be an effort to provide some\r\nmeans for the effectual expression of their collective opinion. Perhaps\r\nthe earliest and most striking example of this movement was the\r\nprovision in 1865 for the election of Harvard's Board of Overseers \"by\r\nsuch persons as have received the degree of B.A. or M.A., or any\r\nhonorary degree,\" from Harvard College. This effort, which came only\r\nafter a long struggle, was duplicated in Princeton, Dartmouth, later\r\nCornell, and many other institutions. Even some of the state\r\nuniversities, whose regents are either elected by the people, as at\r\nMichigan, or appointed by the governor, as in other states, have made\r\nprovision for direct alumni representation on their governing boards.\r\nThough this is not true at Michigan it is significant that of the eight\r\nmembers of the Board of Regents, six, Walter H. Sawyer, '84_h_,\r\nHillsdale; Victor M. Gore, '82_l_, Benton Harbor; Junius E. Beal, '82,\r\nAnn Arbor; Frank B. Leland, '82, '84_l_, Detroit; William L. Clements,\r\n'82, Bay City, and James O. Murfin, '95, 96_l_, Detroit, hold degrees\r\nfrom the University and this proportion has held true for many years.\r\nThe other two members of the present Board are Benjamin S. Hanchett,\r\nGrand Rapids, and L.L. Hubbard, Harvard, '72, Houghton. Shirley W.\r\nSmith, '97, also is Secretary of the University.\r\n\r\nLacking the stimulus of direct representation in the governing body, the\r\nalumni of the state universities have directed their efforts toward\r\nstrengthening the general alumni organization as the best available\r\nmeans of expressing the sentiment of an increasingly important portion\r\nof the university body. To further this desire alumni councils and other\r\nbodies with advisory powers have been established, though usually their\r\nstatus has been uncertain and their powers negligible, except as they\r\nvoice a body of opinion which the university cannot afford to overlook.\r\nThus the Michigan Alumni Advisory Council, established some years ago,\r\ncomposed of representatives from the local alumni bodies, has been for\r\nvarious reasons far from an effective body, though it contains the germ\r\nof a force which may become active whenever a proper occasion may arise.\r\nMore competent, because less unwieldy, is the Executive Committee\r\ncomposed of five members of the Council and two chosen at large. This\r\nbody, though it has only met semi-occasionally, has initiated several\r\nmovements which have had a real influence on the relations between the\r\nUniversity and the graduates. This has been particularly true in matters\r\nrelating to alumni support for the Union, and the problems arising in\r\nconnection with its administration.\r\n\r\nIn its earlier years the Alumni Association also undertook to keep up\r\nthe alumni catalogue and maintained for some time a card index of the\r\nalumni. This task, however, eventually outgrew the resources of the\r\nAssociation, and in 1910 the alumni catalogue was transferred to\r\naddressograph plates by a special appropriation, and its maintenance was\r\nmade a part of the regular administrative work of the University, with a\r\nseparate officer, closely associated with the Alumni Association,\r\nappointed to maintain the lists and edit the catalogues. The labor\r\ninvolved in keeping this list of over 40,000 names even approximately up\r\nto date may be judged from the fact that the catalogue office now\r\nincludes four assistants as well as the Director, Mr. H.L. Sensemann,\r\n'11, of the Department of Rhetoric.\r\n\r\nFor some years the practice was continued of including in the annual\r\ncalendar an \"Alumnorum catalogus,\" which began in 1848 with the names of\r\nthe fifty-six graduates of the first four classes. The list eventually\r\nbecame too long, however, and in 1864 the first General Catalogue was\r\nissued as a forty-page pamphlet which included 999 names. Four\r\nsubsequent editions have appeared, in 1871, 1891, 1901 and 1911, in\r\naddition to a privately published volume issued in 1880. The slender\r\npamphlet of 1864 became, in 1911, a volume of 1,096 pages which recorded\r\n43,666 names, while the catalogue of 1921 will be even more impressive.\r\n\r\nThough the interest and enthusiasm of the graduates is expressed in many\r\nless spectacular ways, the amount of alumni gifts is the most available\r\nstandard by which the effectiveness of this support can be shown. Judged\r\nby this rough and ready approximation for a force which is in reality\r\nintangible and based on something finer and more spiritual than material\r\ngifts, particularly since it represents obviously only the sentiment of\r\nthe few rather than that of the thousands who would do likewise if they\r\nwere able, it shows nevertheless how responsively the University's\r\nalumni regard her call for their support. They have given their alma\r\nmater funds and property whose estimated value may be conservatively\r\nplaced at from $4,000,000 to $5,000,000. This includes many gifts of\r\nsmall sums for loan funds, fellowships, and investigations in special\r\nfields, as well as the income from these funds up to the present time.\r\nSome of these gifts, too, are of such a character that no definite value\r\ncan be placed upon them.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of such special funds in the hands of the University\r\nTreasurer, largely arising from alumni gifts, is $843,815.40. It should\r\nalso be borne in mind that this does not include the many gifts which do\r\nnot come from graduates of the University, such as the Newberry Hall of\r\nResidence, the late Charles L. Freer's numerous gifts, including a fund\r\nof $50,000 for the study of Oriental art, the Lewis Art collection, the\r\nStearns Musical Collections, Waterman Gymnasium and Ferry Field, or such\r\nbuildings as Newberry Hall, now used by the Y.W.C.A., and Lane Hall, for\r\nthe University Y.M.C.A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CONCOURSE OR GENERAL LOBBY IN THE MICHIGAN UNION]\r\n\r\nTwo of the larger gifts to the University have come through collective\r\neffort on the part of the alumni. The Michigan Union, made possible\r\nthrough the $1,200,000 raised by students and alumni, has been mentioned\r\nin another chapter. Alumni Memorial Hall, which stands just across the\r\nstreet, is also largely the result of comparatively small gifts from\r\nhundreds of graduates. It is an imposing building of classical outlines,\r\ndesigned as a memorial of the men who served in the Civil and\r\nSpanish-American Wars. It is intended to be at once an art gallery and\r\nthe headquarters of the Alumni Association, which has a spacious\r\nreception room on the first floor and commodious offices in the\r\nbasement, where the University Club also has a large and well-furnished\r\nroom. The building was completed in 1910 at a cost of $195,000, of which\r\n$145,000 was contributed by the alumni, and was formally opened with an\r\nexhibition of Oriental art and the work of modern American painters\r\nunder the charge of the late Charles M. Freer of Detroit, who loaned\r\nmany of the pictures shown.\r\n\r\nOther gifts arising from general alumni effort are the Williams\r\nProfessorship fund and the Alumnae Hall of Residence for women, given to\r\nthe University by the alumnae; while Faculty, alumni, and student\r\nefforts have been responsible for several paintings, notably the Chase\r\nportrait of Dr. Angell, the portrait of Dr. V.C. Vaughan by Gari\r\nMelchers, and Ralph Clarkson's recent picture of President Hutchins,\r\nwhich is to hang with Dr. Angell's portrait in the Union.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of alumni gifts, however, have come from individual\r\ngraduates. These include such monumental benefactions as the Hill\r\nAuditorium, for which a bequest of $200,000 was left by the late Regent\r\nArthur Hill, '65_e_, of Saginaw; the Martha Cook Building which was\r\ncompleted at a cost of about $500,000 by the Cook family of Hillsdale,\r\nthe Betsy Barbour Dormitory, costing some $100,000 given by ex-Regent\r\nLevi L. Barbour, '63, '65_l_, of Detroit, and the great library of\r\nAmerican history, with its special building, given by Regent William L.\r\nClements, '82_e_, of Bay City. This library, which is reported to have\r\ncost $400,000, and has been judged by experts to be worth much more than\r\nthat now, and the $200,000 building to come, represent a princely gift.\r\nEx-Regent Barbour also gave, in 1917, a fund of $100,000 to be used for\r\nproviding scholarships for Oriental women in the University. To this he\r\nadded two years later property in Detroit from which the income alone,\r\nduring the term of the ninety-nine years' lease now in effect upon it,\r\nwill amount to nearly $2,500,000. The sum of $100,000 was also left by\r\nthe late Professor Richard Hudson, '71, to establish a professorship in\r\nhistory, at present held by Professor Arthur Lyon Cross, Harvard, '95.\r\nProfessor Hudson also left his library to the University, which has\r\nbenefited by many similar gifts from alumni, notably the historical\r\nbooks given by Clarence M. Burton, '73, the library of Thomas S. Jerome,\r\n'84, of Capri, Italy, and the musical library presented by Frederick and\r\nFrederick K. Stearns, '73-'76, as well as the libraries of several\r\nmembers of the Faculties given the University upon their death. These\r\ninclude the library in Romance Literature of Professor Edward L. Walter,\r\n'68, the philosophical library of Professor George S. Morris, '81\r\n(hon.), the Germanic Library of Professor George A. Hench, the\r\ngeological library of Professor Israel C. Russell, and the classical\r\nlibrary of Professor Elisha Jones, '59.\r\n\r\nToo numerous to mention in detail are the many special gifts for\r\nresearch, such as the continual funds for the work of the University\r\nMuseum supplied by Bryant Walker, '76, of Detroit, or the large\r\ntelescope and other gifts to the Department of Astronomy by Robert P.\r\nLamont, '91_e_, of Chicago, or for fellowships, the purchase of books,\r\neducational material, and scientific apparatus, as well as the numerous\r\nfunds left for various designated purposes and administered by the\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nThe various memorials left by the graduating classes should not be\r\nforgotten in this connection, though some of them, owing to poor\r\njudgment, have been ill-adapted to the purposes they were intended to\r\nserve and have more or less mysteriously disappeared. Perhaps the best\r\nknown example was the ill-fated statue of Ben Franklin, long a Campus\r\nlandmark, left by the class of '70. Early in his academic course he\r\nbecame the victim of the paint-buckets of successive classes, and\r\neventually his outlines became so blurred that he was perforce retired.\r\nAside from the tree-planting efforts of '58, the first class memorial\r\nwas the reproduction of the Laocooen group, now in Alumni Memorial Hall,\r\npresented by '59. Reproductions of painting and sculpture were for many\r\nyears the favored forms of class memorials, of which the most unique and\r\nvaluable was the complete set of casts from the arch of Trajan at\r\nBeneventum, presented by '96. In recent years many classes have left\r\nportraits of members of the various Faculties, while others have left\r\nloan funds which have been of inestimable service to many worthy but\r\nimpecunious students.\r\n\r\nThe University chimes, a peal of five bells, presented by James J.\r\nHagerman, '61, Edward C. Hegeler, and Andrew D. White, must not be\r\nforgotten. They are now in the tower of the Engineering Shops, whence\r\nthey were removed when the old Library was torn down.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most far-reaching in its effects was the fund left by 1916.\r\nThis was accompanied by a recommendation to the General Alumni\r\nAssociation that an alumni fund be created of which their contribution\r\nwas to be the nucleus. The Association took measures to act upon this\r\nsuggestion, but owing to the war and the preoccupation of the alumni in\r\nthe Union, its establishment was delayed for several years. The plan for\r\nthis fund, as finally approved in 1920, provides for an incorporated\r\nboard of nine directors, the first members of which were appointed by\r\nthe Board of Directors of the Alumni Association. This project, while\r\nstill in its formative stage, has great possibilities for the future of\r\nthe University, judged by the success of similar funds in other\r\ninstitutions. This is particularly true at Yale, where the alumni fund\r\namounts to nearly $2,000,000 in addition to some $1,500,000 given for\r\nvarious purposes.\r\n\r\nThere are obvious advantages in thus organizing the stream of alumni\r\ngifts now beginning to flow so strongly toward the University. It not\r\nonly provides a trustworthy and conservative body to which any gift may\r\nbe entrusted, whether in the form of a class fund, individual\r\ncontribution, or bequest, but it also ensures that all such gifts which\r\nare unrestricted, shall be utilized wherever, in the judgment of the\r\nDirectors, the University's need is greatest. The existence of such a\r\nfluid source of income properly administered can be made of incalculable\r\nbenefit, particularly in the numerous critical occasions, when the\r\nregular income is entirely unequal to the emergency, though it is not\r\nproposed to relieve the State from providing for the normal needs of the\r\nUniversity, but to meet the special demands which are continually\r\narising in such an institution. Finally, the existence and\r\nadministration of such a fund will tend to tie the alumni to the\r\nUniversity as could no other agency, particularly if, as elsewhere, a\r\ngood part of the income arises from small annual subscriptions,\r\ncollected by a class officer, who remits the total as a class\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\nThus, though the alumni of the University have no direct voice in the\r\nadministration, as have the graduates in many other institutions, they\r\nhave established several agencies through which their natural desire to\r\nhave a recognized share in University affairs may be expressed. These\r\ninclude first of all the General Alumni Association, with its many\r\nsubsidiary class and local organizations, which maintains the _Alumnus_\r\nas its official organ, and with at least the outlines of an advisory\r\nbody in the Alumni Council with its Executive Committee. The alumni also\r\nhave further means of associating themselves with the affairs of the\r\nUniversity through the power of appointment of a majority of the members\r\nof the Board of Governors of the Michigan Union and the Directors of the\r\nAlumni Fund, which rests with the Directors of the Alumni Association;\r\nwhile the four alumni members of the Board of Directors of the Union are\r\nlikewise elected by the alumni at large at the annual meeting in June.\r\n\r\nWith so large and widely distributed a body of graduates it is to be\r\nexpected that many have become prominent in the life of the country, and\r\nin their professions. An analysis of the names of Michigan men and women\r\nin \"Who's Who\" for 1912-13 showed that, exclusive of the holders of\r\nhonorary degrees and Summer School students, the names of 604 former\r\nstudents appeared, of whom 498 were graduates and 106 were\r\nnon-graduates. This is approximately 3.2 percent of the total names\r\ngiven in that edition, and was 6 percent of the college graduates\r\nlisted. There is no reason to suppose that the same percentages at least\r\nwould not apply in a similar survey of the latest edition.\r\n\r\nWhile it is, for obvious reasons, impossible to give the names of all\r\ngraduates who have achieved a certain measure of distinction, a few who\r\nhave attained special prominence in their special fields may be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIt is most natural that Michigan alumni should figure prominently in the\r\neducational world. Thus, among college presidents, in addition to\r\nPresident Hutchins, '71, Michigan can claim Charles Kendall Adams, '61,\r\nPresident of Cornell University from 1885 to 1892, and later, 1892 to\r\n1901, of Wisconsin; Mark Harrington, '68, University of Washington;\r\nAustin Scott, A.M., '70, Rutgers; Alice Freeman Palmer, '76, Wellesley,\r\n1881-87; Henry Wade Rogers, '74, formerly President of Northwestern, and\r\nlater Dean of the Yale Law School; Elmer Ellsworth Brown, '89, New York\r\nUniversity; and Stratton D. Brooks, '96, Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nAside from the many distinguished graduates on her own Faculty rolls,\r\nMichigan has also for many years been well represented in the faculties\r\nof all the leading American universities. At Harvard these include\r\nEdwin L. Mark, '71, Professor of Anatomy; Paul Hanus, '78, Head of the\r\nDepartment of Education; and Edwin F. Gay, '90, until recently Dean of\r\nthe School of Business Administration; at Yale, John E. Clark, '56, for\r\nmany years Professor of Mathematics, and the late Professor Willard T.\r\nBarbour, '05, of the Law School; at Columbia, the late Calvin Thomas,\r\n'74, Professor of Germanic Languages and Literatures; Henry R. Seager,\r\n'90, Professor of Economics; at Dartmouth, Gabriel Campbell, '65, long\r\nProfessor of Philosophy; and Frank H. Dixon, '92, Professor of\r\nEconomics, later occupying the same chair at Princeton; where are also\r\nDuane Reed Stuart, '96, Professor of Greek, Christian Gauss, '98,\r\nProfessor of Romance Languages, and Edward S. Corwin, '00, who now holds\r\nthe chair of Political Science, formerly occupied by President Wilson.\r\nAt Tufts, Amos Dolbear, '67_e_, was for many years Professor of Physics.\r\nThe Johns Hopkins faculty roll shows the names of Henry M. Hurd, '63,\r\n'66_m_, Professor of Psychiatry; John H. Abel, '83_m_, Professor of\r\nPharmacology; Franklin P. Mall, '83_m_, Professor of Anatomy, and\r\nHerbert S. Jennings, '93, Professor of Biology. At Cornell, Jeremiah W.\r\nJenks, '78, was for many years Professor of Social Science and Economics\r\nand now holds a research professorship in New York University. L.M.\r\nDennis, '85, is also Professor of Inorganic Chemistry at Cornell.\r\n\r\nAs is natural, many Michigan teachers are to be found in practically all\r\nthe Western universities, although only a few can be mentioned. Thus at\r\nChicago are Andrew C. McLaughlin, '82, Professor of American History,\r\nJames R. Angell, '90, who was Professor of Psychology and Dean of the\r\nGraduate School until he became President of the Carnegie Foundation in\r\n1920; and at Wisconsin, J.B. Johnson, '78, who was, until his death in\r\n1902, Dean of the Engineering College, and George C. Comstock, '77,\r\nProfessor of Astronomy and Director of the Observatory; while at\r\nMinnesota Edward VanDyke Robinson, '90, is Professor of Economics, and\r\nJohn B. Johnston, '93, Professor of Comparative Neurology and Dean of\r\nthe College, and for a short period the late John R. Allen, '92_e_,\r\nformerly at Michigan, was Dean of the Engineering Department. At Ohio\r\nState University may be mentioned Stillman W. Robinson, '63, Professor\r\nof Mechanical Engineering until 1910, George W. Knight, '78, Professor\r\nof American History, and Joseph V. Denney, '85, Professor of English,\r\nand Dean of the College of Arts; and, at Nebraska, Herbert H. Vaughan,\r\n'03, Professor of Modern Languages. One of the oldest of Michigan's\r\neducators is Professor William J. Beal, '59, Professor of Botany at\r\nMichigan Agricultural College from 1871 to 1910.\r\n\r\nOn the Western coast, Alexander F. Lange, '85, Professor of German at\r\nthe University of California, and Dean of the Faculties, has also served\r\nas Acting-President; while other representatives of Michigan are Charles\r\nM. Gayley, '78, Professor of English, Bernard Moses, '70, Professor of\r\nHistory and Political Science, and Armin O. Leuschner, '88, Professor of\r\nAstronomy. At Stanford are George Hempl, '79, Professor of Germanic\r\nPhilology, Ephraim D. Adams, '87, Professor of History, and Douglas\r\nCampbell, '82, Professor of Botany.\r\n\r\nAmong Michigan graduates in foreign universities may be mentioned the\r\nnames of Stephen Langdon, '98, Professor of Assyriology at Oxford, the\r\nlate Alfred Senier, '74_m_, Professor of Chemistry at the National\r\nUniversity of Ireland at Galway, and Masakozu Toyama, '73-'76, Dean of\r\nthe College of Literature at Tokio until his death in 1900, and founder\r\nof the study of sociology in Japan.\r\n\r\nThough most of the men of attainment in science have continued in\r\nUniversity positions, Robert S. Woodward, 72_e_, President of the\r\nCarnegie Institution, Charles F. Brush, '69_e_, the inventor of the arc\r\nlight, Otto Klotz, '72_e_, Director of the Dominion of Canada\r\nObservatory at Ottawa, William W.
