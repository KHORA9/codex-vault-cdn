The part which railways are\r\nplaying in the struggle has, indeed--in keeping with the magnitude of\r\nthe struggle itself--assumed proportions unexampled in history. Whilst\r\nthis is so it is, nevertheless, a remarkable fact that although much has\r\nbeen said as to the conditions of military unpreparedness in which the\r\noutbreak of hostilities in August, 1914, found the Allies, there has, so\r\nfar as I am aware, been no suggestion of any inability on the part of\r\nthe railways to meet, at once, from the very moment war was declared,\r\nall the requirements of military transport. In this respect, indeed, the\r\norganisation, the preparedness, and the efficiency throughout alike of\r\nthe British and of the French railways have been fully equal to those of\r\nthe German railways themselves.\r\n\r\nAs regards British conditions, especially, much interest attaches to\r\nsome remarks made by Sir Charles Owens, formerly General Manager of\r\nthe London and South Western Railway Company, in the course of an\r\naddress delivered by him to students of the London School of Economics\r\non October 12, 1914. He told how, some five or six years ago, he had\r\nmet at a social function the Secretary of State for War, who, after\r\ndinner, took him aside and asked, \"Do you think in any emergency which\r\nmight arise in this country the railways would be able to cope with it\r\nadequately?\" To this question Sir Charles replied, \"I will stake my\r\nreputation as a railway man that the country could not concentrate men\r\nand materials half so fast as the railways could deal with them; but the\r\nmanagement of the railways must be left in the hands of railway men.\"\r\nWe have here an affirmation and a proviso. That the affirmation was\r\nwarranted has been abundantly proved by what the British railways have\r\naccomplished in the emergency that has arisen. The special significance\r\nof the proviso will be understood in the light of what I record in the\r\npresent work concerning the control of railways in war.\r\n\r\nTaking the railways of all the countries, whether friends or foes,\r\nconcerned in the present World-War, and assuming, for the sake of\r\nargument, that all, without exception, have accomplished marvels in the\r\nway of military transport, one must, nevertheless, bear in mind two\r\nimportant considerations:--\r\n\r\n(1) That, apart from the huge proportions of the scale upon which,\r\nin the aggregate, the railways are being required to serve military\r\npurposes, the present conflict, in spite of its magnitude, has thus far\r\nproduced no absolutely new factor in the employment of railways for war\r\nexcept as regards the use of air-craft for their destruction.\r\n\r\n(2) That when hostilities were declared in August, 1914, the subject\r\nof the employment of railways for the purposes of war had already been\r\nunder the consideration of railway and military experts in different\r\ncountries for no fewer than eighty years, during which period, and\r\nas the result of vast study, much experience, and many blunders in\r\nor between wars in various parts of the world, there had been slowly\r\nevolved certain fixed principles and, also, subject to constant\r\namendments, a recognised and comprehensive organisation which, accepted\r\nmore or less completely by the leading nations, with modifications to\r\nsuit their national circumstances and conditions, was designed to meet\r\nall contingencies, to provide, as far as human foresight could suggest,\r\nfor all possible difficulties, and be capable of application instantly\r\nthe need for it might arise.\r\n\r\nThe time has not yet come for telling all that the railways have thus\r\nfar done during the war which has still to be fought out. That story, in\r\nthe words of a railway man concerned therein, is at present \"a sealed\r\nbook.\" Meanwhile, however, it is desirable that the position as defined\r\nin the second of the two considerations given above should be fully\r\nrealised, in order that what the railways and, so far as they have\r\nbeen aided by them, the combatants, have accomplished or are likely to\r\naccomplish may be better understood when the sealed book becomes an open\r\none.\r\n\r\nIf, as suggested at the outset, the world has already been taken by\r\nsurprise even by what the railways are known to have done, it may be\r\nstill more surprised to learn (as the present work will show) that\r\nthe construction of railways for strategical purposes was advocated\r\nin Germany as early as 1833; that in 1842 a scheme was elaborated for\r\ncovering Germany with a network of strategical railways which, while\r\nserving the entire country, would more especially allow of war being\r\nconducted on two fronts--France and Russia--at the same time; and that\r\nin the same year (1842) attention was already being called in the French\r\nChamber to the \"aggressive lines\" which Germany was building in the\r\ndirection of France, while predictions were also being made that any new\r\ninvasion of France by Germany would be between Metz and Strasburg.\r\n\r\nIf, again, it is found that a good deal of space is devoted in the\r\npresent work to the War of Secession, criticism may, perhaps, be\r\ndisarmed by the explanation that the American Civil War was practically\r\nthe beginning of things as regards the scientific use of railways for\r\nwar, and that many of the problems connected therewith were either\r\nstarted in the United States or were actually worked out there,\r\nprecedents being established and examples being set which the rest of\r\nthe world had simply to follow, adapt or perfect. The possibility of\r\ncarrying on warfare at a great distance from the base of supplies by\r\nmeans of even a single line of single-track railway; the creation of\r\nan organised corps for the restoration, operation or destruction of\r\nrailways; the control of railways in war by the railway or the military\r\ninterests independently or jointly; the question as to when the railway\r\ncould be used to advantage and when it would be better for the troops\r\nto march; the use of armoured trains; the evolution of the ambulance or\r\nthe hospital train--all these, and many other matters besides, are to\r\nbe traced back to the American Civil War of 1861-65, and are dealt with\r\nherein at what, it is hoped, will be found not undue length.\r\n\r\nAs for the building up of the subsequent organisation in\r\nEurope--Germany, France and England being the countries selected\r\nfor special treatment in relation thereto--this, also, has had to\r\nbe described with some regard for detail; and, incidentally, it is\r\nshown (1) that the alleged perfection of Germany's arrangements when\r\nshe went to war with France in 1870-71 is merely one of the fictions\r\nof history, so far as her military rail-transport was concerned; (2)\r\nthat France learned the bitter lesson taught her by the deplorable and\r\nundeniable imperfections of her own transport system--or no-system--on\r\nthat occasion, and at once set about the creation of what was to become\r\nan organisation of the most complete and comprehensive character; and\r\n(3) that the \"beginning of things\" in England, in the way of employing\r\nrailways for the purposes of war, was the direct outcome of the\r\nconditions of semi-panic created here in 1859 by what was regarded as\r\nthe prospect of an early invasion of this country by France, coupled\r\nwith the then recognised deficiencies of our means of national defence.\r\n\r\nMilitary railways, as employed in the Crimean War, the Abyssinian\r\nCampaign, the Franco-German War, the Russo-Turkish War and the Sudan\r\nare described; a detailed account is given of the use of railways in\r\nthe Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War; and this is followed by a\r\ndescription of the strategical railways constructed in Germany for the\r\npurpose of facilitating war on the possessions of her neighbours.\r\n\r\nChapters XIX and XX deal with the building of railways which,\r\nwhether avowedly strategical or what I have described as\r\n\"economic-political-strategical,\" are intended to effect the purposes\r\nof conquest, with or without the accompaniment of war. The former of\r\nthese two chapters, which shows how, with the help of railways, Germany\r\nproposed to transform the African continent into an African Empire of\r\nher own, should be found deserving of notice, and especially so in view\r\nof the statements quoted (p. 311) as having been made by German officers\r\nin what was then German South-West Africa, to the effect that the main\r\nobjective of Germany in going to war would be the conquest of Africa,\r\n\"the smashing up of France and Great Britain\" being regarded only as\r\n\"incidents\" which, followed by seizure of the possessions of the smaller\r\nPowers, would make Germany the supreme Power in Africa, and lead to the\r\nwhole African continent becoming a German possession.\r\n\r\nFrom Chapter XX the reader will learn how Germany proposed to employ\r\nrailways for the furthering of her aims against, not only Asiatic\r\nTurkey, but Egypt and India, as well.\r\n\r\nThe subsidiary articles on \"Indian Frontier Railways\" and \"The Defence\r\nof Australia\" have no direct bearing on that _evolution_ of rail-power\r\nin warfare with which it is the special purpose of the present volume\r\nto deal; but in the belief that they are of interest and importance in\r\nthemselves, from the point of view of the general question, they have\r\nbeen given in an Appendix. The difficulties and other conditions under\r\nwhich the Sind-Pishin State Railway, designed to serve strategical\r\npurposes, was built to the frontiers of Afghanistan are unexampled in\r\nthe history either of railways or of war. As regards Australia, the\r\ngravity of the position there was well indicated by Lord Kitchener when\r\nhe wrote of the lines running inland that they were \"of little use for\r\ndefence, although possibly of considerable value to an enemy who would\r\nhave temporary command of the sea.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the volume there is a Bibliography of books, pamphlets\r\nand review or other articles relating to the use of railways for the\r\npurposes of war. In the first instance this compilation was based on\r\na \"List of References\" prepared by the American Bureau of Railway\r\nEconomics; but, while many items on that list have here been omitted, a\r\nconsiderable number of others have been inserted from other sources. The\r\nBibliography is not offered as being in any way complete, but it may,\r\nnevertheless, be of advantage to students desirous of making further\r\nresearches into the matters of history here specially treated.\r\n\r\nThe assistance rendered in other ways by the American Bureau of Railway\r\nEconomics in the preparation of the present work has been most helpful.\r\nIn the writing of the chapters concerning German designs on Africa, Asia\r\nMinor, etc., the resources of the well-arranged and admirably-indexed\r\nlibrary of the Royal Colonial Institute have been of great service. I\r\nhave, also, to express cordial acknowledgments to the General Managers\r\nand other officers of various leading railway companies for information\r\ngiven respecting the organisation of railways in this country for\r\nmilitary purposes.\r\n\r\n    EDWIN A. PRATT.\r\n    _November, 1915._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rise of Rail-Power in War and Conquest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nA NEW FACTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the original purpose of railways was to promote the arts of\r\npeace, the wide scope of their possibilities in the direction, also, of\r\nfurthering the arts of war began to be realised at a very early date\r\nafter their success in the former capacity had been assured in Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nAlready the canal system had introduced an innovation which greatly\r\nimpressed the British public. In December, 1806, a considerable body of\r\ntroops went by barge on the Paddington Canal from London to Liverpool,\r\n_en route_ for Dublin, relays of fresh horses for the canal boats being\r\nprovided at all the stages in order to facilitate the transport; and in\r\nreferring to this event _The Times_ of December 19, 1806, remarked:--\"By\r\nthis mode of conveyance the men will be only seven days in reaching\r\nLiverpool, and with comparatively little fatigue, as it would take them\r\nabove fourteen days to march that distance.\"\r\n\r\nBut when, on the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, in\r\n1830, a British regiment was conveyed thereon, in two hours, a journey\r\nof thirty-four miles, which they would have required two days to\r\naccomplish on foot, far-seeing men became still more impressed, and\r\nbegan to realise that there had, indeed, been introduced a new factor\r\ndestined to exercise a powerful influence on the future conduct of war.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of the United Kingdom led, in those early\r\ndays, to greater importance being attached to the conveniences of\r\nrailways as a means of transport than to their actual strategical and\r\ntactical advantages; and the issue by the War Office, in 1846, of a\r\n\"Regulation Relative to the Conveyance of Her Majesty's Forces, their\r\nBaggage and Stores, by Rail,\" may have appeared to meet the requirements\r\nof the immediate situation, so far as this country was concerned.\r\n\r\nOn the Continent of Europe, however, the rivalry of nations divided from\r\none another only by a more or less uncertain or varying frontier, and\r\nstill powerfully influenced by the recollection of recent conflicts,\r\nresulted in much greater attention being paid to the possibilities of\r\nthe new development.\r\n\r\nThe first definite proposals for the use of railways for strategical\r\npurposes were advanced, as early as 1833, by Friedrich Wilhelm Harkort,\r\na Westphalian worthy who came to be better known in his native land\r\nas \"Der alte Harkort.\" A participant in the Napoleonic wars, he had\r\nsubsequently shown great energy and enterprise in the development of\r\nsteam engines, hydraulic presses, iron-making, and other important\r\nindustries in Germany; he had been the first writer in that country to\r\ngive an account--as he did in 1825--of the progress England was making\r\nin respect to railways and steamships; and he had, in 1826, placed a\r\nworking model of a railway in the garden of the Elberfeld Museum. These\r\nvarious efforts he followed up, in 1833, by bringing forward in the\r\nWestphalian Landtag a scheme for the building of a railway to connect\r\nthe Weser and the Lippe. Later in the same year he published \"Die\r\nEisenbahn von Minden nach Köln,\" in which he laid special stress on the\r\nvalue to Germany of the proposed line from a military point of view.\r\nWith the help of such a railway, he argued, it would be possible to\r\nconcentrate large bodies of troops at a given point much more speedily\r\nthan if they marched by road; he made calculations as to what the actual\r\nsaving in time, as well as in physical strain, would be in transporting\r\nPrussian troops from various specified centres to others; and he\r\nproceeded:--\r\n\r\n    Let us suppose that we had a railway and a telegraph line\r\n    on the right bank of the Rhine, from Mainz to Wesel. Any\r\n    crossing of the Rhine by the French would then scarcely be\r\n    possible, since we should be able to bring a strong defensive\r\n    force on the spot before the attempt could be developed.\r\n\r\n    These things may appear very strange to-day; yet in the womb\r\n    of the future there slumbers the seed of great developments in\r\n    railways, the results of which it is, as yet, quite beyond our\r\n    powers to foresee.\r\n\r\nHarkort's proposals gave rise to much vigorous controversy in Germany.\r\nThe official classes condemned as \"nonsensical fancies\" his ideas, not\r\nonly as to the usefulness of railways for the conveyance of troops, but,\r\nalso, as to the utility of railways for any practical purposes whatever;\r\nand contemporary newspapers and periodicals, in turn, made him the butt\r\nof their ridicule.\r\n\r\nThe pros and cons of the use of railways for military purposes were,\r\nnone the less, actively discussed in numerous pamphlets and treatises.\r\nJust as, in France, General Rumigny, adjutant to Louis-Philippe, had\r\nalready foreshadowed the possibility of a sudden invasion by a German\r\narmy reaching the frontier by rail, so, also, in Germany, in the words\r\nof one writer at this period, \"anxious spirits shudder at the thought\r\nthat, some fine spring morning, a hundred thousand Frenchmen, thirsting\r\nfor war, will suddenly invade our peaceful valleys at bird-like speed,\r\nthanks to the new means of locomotion, and begin their old game (_das\r\nalte Spiel_) over again.\" On the other hand there were military\r\nsceptics--such as the author of a pamphlet \"Uber die Militärische\r\nBenutzung der Eisenbahnen\" (Berlin, 1836)--who, basing their\r\ncalculations on locomotive performances up to that date, asserted that,\r\nalthough the railway might be of service in the conveyance of supplies,\r\nguns and ammunition, it would be of no advantage in the transport of\r\ntroops. These, they declared, would get to their destination sooner if\r\nthey marched.[1]\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable of the various publications issued in Germany at\r\nthis period was a book by Carl Eduard Pönitz (\"Pz.\"), which appeared\r\nat Adorf, Saxony, in 1842, under the title of \"Die Eisenbahnen\r\nals militärische Operationslinien betrachtet, und durch Beispiele\r\nerlaütert.\" The writer of this remarkable book (of which a second\r\nedition was issued in 1853) gave a comprehensive survey of the whole\r\nsituation in regard to railways and war, so far as the subject could\r\nbe dealt with in the light of railway developments and of actual\r\nexperiences of troop movements by rail down to that time; and he argued\r\nstrongly in favour of the advantages to be derived from the employment\r\nof railways for military purposes. He even suggested that, in the event\r\nof an inadequate supply of locomotives, or of operations having to be\r\nconducted in a mountainous country where locomotives could not be used\r\nfor heavy traffic, the troops might still use their own horses to draw\r\nthe coaches and wagons along the railway lines, so that the men would\r\narrive fresh and fit for immediate fighting at the end of their journey.\r\n\r\nDescribing railways as the most powerful vehicle for the advancement of\r\n\"Kultur\" since the invention of printing, Pönitz showed how Belgium and\r\nSaxony were the two countries which had taken the initiative in railway\r\nconstruction on the Continent of Europe; and his references to the\r\nformer country are especially deserving of being recalled, in view of\r\nrecent events. He pointed to the good example which had been set by the\r\n\"far-sighted and energetic\" King of the Belgians, and continued:--\r\n\r\n    Although, in a land torn asunder by revolutionary factions,\r\n    many wounds were still bleeding; and although the newly-created\r\n    kingdom was threatened by foes within and without and could\r\n    organise means of resistance only with great difficulty, there\r\n    was, nevertheless, taken in hand a scheme for the construction\r\n    of a network of railways designed to extend over the entire\r\n    country, while at the present moment the greater part of\r\n    that scheme has, in fact, been carried out. In this way King\r\n    Leopold has raised up for himself a memorial the full value\r\n    and significance of which may, perhaps, be appreciated only by\r\n    generations yet to come.\r\n\r\nWhile Belgium was thus shown to have been setting a good example, the\r\nonly railways which Prussia then had in actual operation (apart from\r\nthe Berlin-Stettin and the Berlin-Breslau lines, which had been begun,\r\nand others which had been projected) were the Berlin-Potsdam and the\r\nBerlin-Magdeburg-Leipzig lines; though Saxony had the Leipzig-Dresden\r\nline, and Bavaria the Nüremberg-Fürth and the Munich-Augsburg lines.\r\nPönitz, however, excused the backwardness of Prussia on the ground\r\nthat if her Government had refused, for a long time, to sanction\r\nvarious projected railways, or had imposed heavy obligations in\r\nregard to them, such action was due, not to prejudice, but to \"a wise\r\nforesight\"--meaning, presumably, that Prussia was waiting to profit by\r\nthe experience that other countries were gaining at their own cost.\r\n\r\nHaving dealt with all the arguments he could advance in favour of the\r\ngeneral principle of employing railways for military purposes, Pönitz\r\nproceeded to elaborate a scheme for the construction of a network of\r\nstrategical lines serving the whole of Germany, though intended, more\r\nespecially, to protect her frontiers against attack by either France\r\nor Russia. Without, he said, being in the secrets of international\r\npolitics, he thought he might safely presume that Germany's only fear of\r\nattack was from one of these two directions; and, although the relations\r\nof the Great Powers of Europe were then peaceful, a continuance of those\r\nconditions could not, of course, be guaranteed. So, he proceeded--\r\n\r\n    We have to look to these two fronts; and, if we want\r\n    to avoid the risk of heavy losses at the outset, we needs\r\n    must--also at the outset--be prepared to meet the enemy there\r\n    with an overwhelming force. Every one knows that the strength of\r\n    an army is multiplied by movements which are rapid in themselves\r\n    and allow of the troops arriving at the end of their journey\r\n    without fatigue.\r\n\r\nIn a powerful appeal--based on motives alike of patriotism, of national\r\ndefence and of economic advantage--that his fellow-countrymen should\r\nsupport the scheme he thus put forward, Pönitz once more pointed to\r\nBelgium, saying:--\r\n\r\n    The youngest of all the European States has given us an\r\n    example of what can be done by intelligence and good will.\r\n    The network of Belgian railways will be of as much advantage\r\n    in advancing the industries of that country as it will be in\r\n    facilitating the defence of the land against attack by France.\r\n    It will increase alike Belgium's prosperity and Belgium's\r\n    security. And we Germans, who place so high a value on our\r\n    intelligence, and are scarcely yet inclined to recognise the\r\n    political independence of the Belgian people, shall we remain so\r\n    blind as not to see what is needed for our own safety?\r\n\r\nPönitz could not, of course, anticipate in 1842 that the time would\r\ncome when his country, acting to the full on the advice he was then\r\ngiving, would have her strategic railways, not only to the French and\r\nthe Russian, but, also, to the Belgian frontier, and would use those in\r\nthe last-mentioned direction to crush remorselessly the little nation\r\nconcerning which he himself was using words of such generous sympathy\r\nand approbation.\r\n\r\nThe ideas and proposals put forward by Pönitz (of whose work a French\r\ntranslation, under the title of \"Essai sur les Chemins de Fer,\r\nconsidérés commes lignes d'opérations militaires,\" was published by L.\r\nA. Unger in Paris, in 1844) did much to stimulate the discussion of the\r\ngeneral question, while the military authorities of Germany were moved\r\nto make investigations into it on their own account, there being issued\r\nin Berlin, about 1848 or 1850, a \"Survey of the Traffic and Equipment of\r\nGerman and of neighbouring foreign Railways for military purposes, based\r\non information collected by the Great General Staff.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIn France, also, there were those who, quite early in the days of the\r\nnew means of transport, predicted the important service it was likely to\r\nrender for the purposes of war no less than for those of peace.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lamarque declared in the French Chamber of Deputies in 1832, or\r\n1833, that the strategical use of railways would lead to \"a revolution\r\nin military science as great as that which had been brought about by the\r\nuse of gunpowder.\"\r\n\r\nAt the sitting of the Chamber on May 25, 1833, M. de Bérigny, in urging\r\nthe \"incontestable\" importance of railways, said:--\r\n\r\n    From the point of view of national defence, what advantages\r\n    do they not present! An army, with all its material, could, in a\r\n    few days, be transported from the north to the south, from the\r\n    east to the west, of France. If a country could thus speedily\r\n    carry considerable masses of troops to any given point on its\r\n    frontiers, would it not become invincible, and would it not,\r\n    also, be in a position to effect great economies in its military\r\n    expenditure?\r\n\r\nIn a further debate on June 8, 1837, M. Dufaure declared that railways\r\nhad a greater mission to fulfil than that of offering facilities to\r\nindustry or than that of conferring benefits on private interests. Was\r\nit a matter of no account, he asked, that they should be able in one\r\nnight to send troops to all the frontiers of France, from Paris to\r\nthe banks of the Rhine, from Lyons to the foot of the Alps, with an\r\nassurance of their arriving fresh and ready for combat?\r\n\r\nThen, in 1842, M. Marschall, advocating the construction of a line from\r\nParis to Strasburg, predicted that any new invasion of France by Germany\r\nwould most probably be attempted between Metz and Strasburg. He further\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    It is there that the German Confederation is converging\r\n    a formidable system of railways from Cologne, Mayence and\r\n    Mannheim.... Twenty-four hours will suffice for our neighbours\r\n    to concentrate on the Rhine the forces of Prussia, Austria and\r\n    the Confederation, and on the morrow an army of 400,000 men\r\n    could invade our territory by that breach of forty leagues\r\n    between Thionville and Lauterburg, which are the outposts of\r\n    Strasburg and Metz. Three months later, the reserve system\r\n    organised in Prussia and in some of the other German States\r\n    would allow of a second Army being sent of equal force to the\r\n    other. The title of \"aggressive lines\" given by our neighbours\r\n    to these railways leave us with no room for doubt as to their\r\n    intentions. Studies for an expedition against Paris by way of\r\n    Lorraine and Champagne can hardly be regarded as indicative of a\r\n    sentiment of fraternity.\r\n\r\nFrance, however, had no inclination at that time to build railways\r\ndesigned to serve military purposes, whether from the point of view of\r\naggression or even from that of national defence; so that in a letter to\r\nhis brother Ludwig, written April 13, 1844, von Moltke, then a member\r\nof the General Staff of the Fourth Army Corps of the Prussian Army,\r\ndeclared that whilst Germany was building railways, the French Chamber\r\nwas only discussing them. This was so far the case that when, later on,\r\nGermany had nearly 3,300 miles of railway France was operating only a\r\nlittle over 1,000 miles.\r\n\r\nApart from the experiences, on quite a small scale, which had been\r\nobtained on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the earliest example\r\nof what railways could do in the transport of large bodies of troops\r\nwas afforded in 1846, when Prussia's Sixth Army Corps--consisting\r\nof over 12,000 men, together with horses, guns, road vehicles and\r\nammunition--was moved by rail, upon two lines, to Cracow. In 1849 a\r\nRussian corps of 30,000 men, with all its equipment, was taken by rail\r\nfrom its cantonments in Poland to Göding, Moravia, whence it effected a\r\njunction with the Austrian army. There was, also, a certain movement of\r\nGerman troops by rail to Schleswig-Holstein in the troubles of 1848-50;\r\nbut of greater importance than these other instances was the transport\r\nof an Austrian army of 75,000 men, 8,000 horses and 1,000 vehicles from\r\nVienna and Hungary to the Silesian frontier in the early winter of 1850.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, owing to the combined disadvantages of single-line\r\nrailways, inadequate staff and rolling stock, unfavourable weather, lack\r\nof previous preparations and of transport regulations, and delays from\r\nvarious unforeseen causes, no fewer than twenty-six days were occupied\r\nin the transport, although the journey was one of only about 150 miles.\r\nIt was, also, admitted that the troops could have marched the distance\r\nin the same time. All the same, as told by Regierungsrat Wernekke,[3]\r\nthe movement of so large a body of troops by rail at all was regarded\r\nas especially instructive. It was the cause of greater attention being\r\npaid to the use of railways for military purposes, while it further led\r\n(1) to the drawing up, in May, 1851, of a scheme for the construction\r\nthroughout the Austrian monarchy of railways from the special point\r\nof view of strategical requirements; and (2) to a reorganisation of\r\nthe methods hitherto adopted for the transport of troops by rail, the\r\nresult being that the next considerable movement in Austria--in the year\r\n1853--was conducted with \"unprecedented regularity and efficiency,\" and\r\nthis, also, without any cessation of the ordinary traffic of the lines\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 a further striking object lesson of the usefulness of railways\r\nwas afforded by the moving of a division of 14,500 men, with nearly\r\n2,000 horses, 48 guns and 464 vehicles, from Cracow to Hradish,\r\na distance of 187 miles, in two days. Reckoning that a large column\r\nof troops, with all its impedimenta, would march twelve miles per\r\nday, and allowing for one day's rest in seven, the movement would, in\r\nthis instance, have occupied fifteen days by road instead of two days\r\nby rail.\r\n\r\nIt was in the _Italian campaign of 1859_ that railways first played a\r\nconspicuous part in actual warfare, both strategically and tactically.\r\n\"In this campaign,\" said Major Millar, R.A., V.C., of the Topographical\r\nStaff, in two lectures delivered by him at the Royal United Service\r\nInstitution in 1861[4]--\r\n\r\n    Railways assisted the ordinary means of locomotion hitherto\r\n    employed by armies. By them thousands of men were carried\r\n    daily through France to Toulon, Marseilles, or the foot of\r\n    Mont Cenis; by them troops were hastened up to the very fields\r\n    of battle; and by them injured men were brought swiftly back\r\n    to the hospitals, still groaning in the first agony of their\r\n    wounds. Moreover, the railway cuttings, embankments and bridges\r\n    presented features of importance equal or superior to the\r\n    ordinary accidents of the ground, and the possession of which\r\n    was hotly contested. If you go to Magenta you will see, close\r\n    to the railway platform on which you alight, an excavation full\r\n    of rough mounds and simple black crosses, erected to mark the\r\n    resting-places of many hundred men who fell in the great fight.\r\n    This first employment of railways in close connection with vast\r\n    military operations would alone be enough to give a distinction\r\n    to this campaign in military history.\r\n\r\nThe French railways, especially, attained a remarkable degree of\r\nsuccess. In eighty-six days--from April 19 to July 15--they transported\r\nan aggregate of 604,000 men and over 129,000 horses, including nearly\r\n228,000 men and 37,000 horses sent to Culox, Marseilles, Toulon,\r\nGrenoble and Aix by lines in the south-east. The greatest movements\r\ntook place during the ten days from April 20 to April 30, when the\r\nParis-Lyons Company, without interrupting the ordinary traffic, conveyed\r\nan average per day of 8,421 men and 512 horses. On April 25, a maximum\r\nof 12,138 men and 655 horses was attained. During the eighty-six days\r\nthere were run on the lines of the same company a total of 2,636 trains,\r\nincluding 253 military specials. It was estimated that the 75,966 men\r\nand 4,469 horses transported by rail from Paris to the Mediterranean\r\nor to the frontiers of the Kingdom of Sardinia between April 20 and\r\nApril 30 would have taken sixty days to make the journey by road. In\r\neffect, the rate of transit by rail was six times greater than the rate\r\nof progress by marching would have been, and this, again, was about\r\ndouble as fast as the best achievement recorded up to that time on the\r\nGerman railways. The Chasseurs de Vincennes are described as leaving\r\nthe station at Turin full of vigour and activity, and with none of the\r\nfatigue or the reduction in numbers which would have occurred had they\r\nmade the journey by road.\r\n\r\nAs against, however, the advantage thus gained by the quicker transport\r\nof the French troops to the seat of war, due to the successful manner\r\nin which the railways were operated, there had to be set some serious\r\ndefects in administrative organisation. When the men got to the end\r\nof their rail journey there was a more or less prolonged waiting for\r\nthe food and other necessaries which were to follow. There were grave\r\ndeficiencies, also, in the dispatch of the subsequent supplies. On June\r\n25, the day after the defeat of the Austrians, the French troops had\r\nno provisions at all for twenty-four hours, except some biscuits which\r\nwere so mouldy that no one could eat them. Their horses, also, were\r\nwithout fodder. In these circumstances it was impossible to follow up\r\nthe Austrians in their retreat beyond the Mincio.\r\n\r\nThus the efficiency of the French railways was to a large extent\r\nnegatived by the inefficiency of the military administration; and in\r\nthese respects France had a foretaste, in 1859, of experiences to be\r\nrepeated on a much graver scale in the Franco-German War of 1870-71.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Austrians, they improved but little on their admittedly\r\npoor performance in 1850, in spite of the lessons they appeared to\r\nhave learned as the result of their experiences on that occasion.\r\nGovernment and railways were alike unprepared. Little or no real attempt\r\nat organisation in time of peace had been made, and, in the result,\r\ntrains were delayed or blocked, and stations got choked with masses\r\nof supplies which could not be forwarded. At Vienna there was such a\r\ndeficiency of rolling stock--accelerated by great delays in the return\r\nof empties--that many of the troop trains for the South could not be\r\nmade up until the last moment. Even then the average number of men they\r\nconveyed did not exceed about 360. At Laibach there was much congestion\r\nbecause troops had to wait there for instructions as to their actual\r\ndestination. Other delays occurred because, owing to the heavy gradients\r\nof the Semmering Pass, each train had to be divided into three sections\r\nbefore it could proceed. Between, again, Innsbruck and Bozen the railway\r\nwas still incomplete, and the First Corps (about 40,000 men and 10,000\r\nhorses) had to march between these two points on their journey from\r\nPrague to Verona. Notwithstanding this fact, it was estimated that they\r\ncovered in fourteen days a journey which would have taken sixty-four\r\ndays if they had marched all the way. From Vienna to Lombardy the Third\r\nArmy Corps (20,000 men, 5,500 horses, with guns, ammunition and 300\r\nwagons) was carried by rail in fourteen days, the rate of progress\r\nattained being four and a half times greater than by road marching,\r\nthough still inferior by one and a half times to what the French\r\ntroop-trains had accomplished.\r\n\r\nOn both sides important reinforcements were brought up at critical\r\nperiods during the progress of the war. Referring to the attacks by\r\nthe allies on Casteggio and Montebello, Count Gyulai, the Austrian\r\nGeneral, wrote:--\"The enemy soon displayed a superior force, which was\r\ncontinually increased by arrivals from the railway\"; and the special\r\ncorrespondent of _The Times_, writing from Pavia on May 21, 1859, said:--\r\n\r\n    From the heights of Montebello the Austrians beheld a\r\n    novelty in the art of war. Train after train arrived by railway\r\n    from Voghera, each train disgorging its hundreds of armed men\r\n    and immediately hastening back for more. In vain Count Stadion\r\n    endeavoured to crush the force behind him before it could be\r\n    increased enough to overpower him.\r\n\r\nThen, also, the good use made of the railways by the allies in carrying\r\nout their important flanking movement against the Austrians at Vercelli\r\ngave further evidence of the fact that rail-power was a new force which\r\ncould be employed, not alone for the earlier concentration of troops at\r\nthe seat of war, but, also, in support of strategic developments on the\r\nbattle-field itself. Commenting on this fact the _Spectateur Militaire_\r\nsaid, in its issue for September, 1869:--\r\n\r\n    Les chemins de fer ont joué un rôle immense dans cette\r\n    concentration. C'est la première fois que, dans l'histoire\r\n    militaire, ils servent d'une manière aussi merveilleuse et\r\n    entrent dans les combinaisons stratégiques.\r\n\r\nWhile these observations were fully warranted by the results\r\naccomplished in regard to concentration, reinforcements and tactical\r\nmovements by rail, the campaign also brought out more clearly than\r\never before the need, if railways were to fulfil their greatest\r\npossible measure of utility in time of war, of working out in advance\r\nall important details likely to arise in connection with the movement\r\nof troops, instead--as in the case of the Austrians, at least--of\r\nneglecting any serious attempt at organisation until the need arose for\r\nimmediate action.\r\n\r\nFrom all these various points of view the Italian campaign of 1859\r\nmarked a further important stage in the early development of that new\r\nfactor which the employment of railways for the purposes of warfare\r\nrepresented; though far greater results in the same direction were to\r\nbe brought about, shortly afterwards, by the American Civil War of\r\n1861-65. Not only does the real development of rail-power as a new arm\r\nin war date therefrom, but the War of Secession was to establish in a\r\npre-eminent degree (1) the possibility, through the use of railways,\r\nof carrying on operations at a considerable distance from the base\r\nof supplies; (2) the need of a special organisation to deal alike\r\nwith restoration of railway lines destroyed by the enemy and with the\r\ninterruption, in turn, of the enemy's own communications; and (3) the\r\ndifficulties that may arise as between the military element and the\r\ntechnical (railway) element in regard to the control and operation of\r\nrailways during war. To each of these subjects it is proposed to devote\r\na separate chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In 1847 one of the leading military writers in Germany published a\r\npamphlet in which he sought to prove that the best-organised railway\r\ncould not carry 10,000 Infantry a distance equal to sixty English miles\r\nin twenty-four hours. As for the conveyance of Cavalry and Artillery by\r\ntrain, he declared that this would be a sheer impossibility.\r\n\r\n[2] \"Uebersicht des Verkehrs und der Betriebsmittel auf den inländischen\r\nund den benachbarten ausländischen Eisenbahnen für militärischen Zwecke;\r\nnach dem beim grossen Generalstabe vorhanden Materialen zusammen\r\ngestellt.\"\r\n\r\n[3] \"Die Mitwirkung der Eisenbahn an den Kriegen in Mitteleuropa.\"\r\n\"Archiv für Eisenbahnwesen,\" Juli und August, 1912.\r\n\r\n[4] \"Journal of the Royal United Service Institution,\" vol. v, pp.\r\n269-308. London, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nRAILWAYS IN THE CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the conditions under which the War of Secession in the United\r\nStates was fought that without the help of railways it could hardly have\r\nbeen fought at all.\r\n\r\nThe area of the military operations, from first to last, was equal in\r\nextent almost to the whole of Europe. The line of separation between the\r\nrival forces of North and South was fully 2,000 miles. Large portions\r\nof this region were then unexplored. Everywhere, except in the towns,\r\nit was but thinly populated. Civilisation had not yet progressed so far\r\nthat an advancing army could always depend on being able to \"live on the\r\ncountry.\" There were occasions when local supplies of food and forage\r\nwere so difficult of attainment that an army might be wholly dependent\r\non a base hundreds of miles distant from the scene of its operations.\r\n\r\nOf roads and tracks throughout this vast area there were but few, and\r\nthese were mostly either indifferent or bad, even if they did not become\r\npositively execrable in wet weather or after a considerable force of\r\ntroops had passed along them. In the low-lying districts, especially,\r\nthe alluvial undrained soil was speedily converted by the winter floods\r\ninto swamps and lakes. Further difficulties in the movement of troops\r\nwere offered by pathless forests as large as an English county; and\r\nstill others by the broad rivers or the mountain ranges it might be\r\nnecessary to cross.\r\n\r\nApart from the deficient and defective roads and tracks, the transport\r\nfacilities available for the combatants were those afforded by coastal\r\nservices, navigable rivers, canals and railways. Of these it was the\r\nrailways that played the most important rôle.\r\n\r\nThe American railway lines of those days had, generally speaking,\r\nbeen constructed as cheaply as possible by the private enterprise\r\nwhich--though with liberal grants of land and other advantages--alone\r\nundertook their provision, the main idea being to supply a railway of\r\nsome sort to satisfy immediate wants and to improve it later on, when\r\npopulation and traffic increased and more funds were available. The\r\nlines themselves were mostly single track; the ballasting was too often\r\nimperfect; iron rails of inadequate weight soon wore down and got out\r\nof shape; sleepers (otherwise \"ties\"), which consisted of logs of wood\r\nbrought straight from the forests, speedily became rotten, especially in\r\nlow-lying districts; while, in the early 'Sixties lumber, used either in\r\nthe rough or smoothed on two sides, was still the customary material for\r\nthe building of bridges and viaducts carrying the railways across narrow\r\nstreams, broad rivers or widespread valleys.\r\n\r\nAll the same, these railways, while awaiting their later betterment,\r\nextended for long distances, served as a connecting link of inestimable\r\nadvantage between the various centres of population and production, and\r\noffered in many instances the only practicable means by which troops\r\nand supplies could be moved. They fulfilled, in fact, purposes of such\r\nvital importance from a strategical point of view that many battles\r\nwere fought primarily for the control of particular railways, for the\r\nsafeguarding of lines of communication, or for the possession, more\r\nespecially, of important junctions, some of which themselves became the\r\nbase for more or less distant operations.\r\n\r\nThe North, bent not simply on invasion but on reconquest of the States\r\nwhich had seceded, necessarily took the offensive; the South stood\r\nmostly on the defensive. Yet while the population in the North was far\r\nin excess of that in the South, the initial advantages from a transport\r\npoint of view were in favour of the South, which found its principal\r\nally in the railways. Generals in the North are, indeed, said to have\r\nbeen exceedingly chary, at first, in getting far away from the magazines\r\nthey depended on for their supplies; though this uneasiness wore off in\r\nproportion as organised effort showed how successfully the lines of\r\nrail communication could be defended.\r\n\r\nIn these and other circumstances, and especially in view of the\r\nparamount importance the railway system was to assume in the conduct of\r\nthe war, the Federal Government took possession of the Philadelphia,\r\nWilmington and Baltimore Railway on March 31, 1861. This preliminary\r\nmeasure was followed by the passing, in January, 1862, by the United\r\nStates House of Representatives, of \"An Act to authorise the President\r\nof the United States in certain cases to take possession of railroad and\r\ntelegraph lines, and for other purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe President, \"when in his judgment the public safety may require it,\"\r\nwas \"to take possession of any or all the telegraph lines in the United\r\nStates; ... to take possession of any or all the railroad lines in the\r\nUnited States, their rolling stock, their offices, shops, buildings\r\nand all their appendages and appurtenances; to prescribe rules and\r\nregulations for the holding, using, and maintaining of the aforesaid\r\ntelegraph and railroad lines, and to extend, repair and complete the\r\nsame in the manner most conducive to the safety and interest of the\r\nGovernment; to place under military control all the officers, agents\r\nand employés belonging to the telegraph and railroad lines thus taken\r\npossession of by the President, so that they shall be considered as a\r\npost road and a part of the military establishment of the United States,\r\nsubject to all the restrictions imposed by the Rules and Articles of\r\nWar.\" Commissioners were to be appointed to assess and determine the\r\ndamages suffered, or the compensation to which any railroad or telegraph\r\ncompany might be entitled by reason of such seizure of their property;\r\nand it was further enacted \"that the transportation of troops, munitions\r\nof war, equipments, military property and stores, throughout the United\r\nStates, should be under the immediate control and supervision of the\r\nSecretary of War and such agents as he might appoint.\"\r\n\r\nThus the Act in question established a precedent for a Government\r\ntaking formal possession of, and exercising complete authority and\r\ncontrol over, the whole of such railways as it might require to employ\r\nfor the purposes of war; although, in point of fact, only such lines,\r\nor portions of lines, were so taken over by the War Department as were\r\nactually required. In each instance, also, the line or portion of line\r\nin question was given back to the owning company as soon as it was no\r\nlonger required for military purposes; while at the conclusion of the\r\nwar all the lines taken possession of by the Government were formally\r\nrestored to their original owners by an Executive Order dated August 8,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority of the Act of January 31, 1862, the following\r\norder was sent to Mr. Daniel Craig McCallum, a native of Johnstone,\r\nRenfrewshire, Scotland, who had been taken to America by his parents\r\nwhen a youth, had joined the railway service, had held for many years\r\nthe position of general superintendent of the Erie Railroad, and was\r\none of the ablest and most experienced railway men then in the United\r\nStates:--\r\n\r\n    WAR DEPARTMENT.\r\n    Washington City, D.C.,\r\n    _February 11, 1862_.\r\n\r\n    _Ordered_, That D. C. McCallum be, and he is hereby,\r\n    appointed Military Director and Superintendent of Railroads in\r\n    the United States, with authority to enter upon, take possession\r\n    of, hold and use all railroads, engines, cars, locomotives,\r\n    equipments, appendages and appurtenances that may be required\r\n    for the transport of troops, arms, ammunition and military\r\n    supplies of the United States, and to do and perform all acts\r\n    and things that may be necessary and proper to be done for the\r\n    safe and speedy transport aforesaid.\r\n\r\n    By order of the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Army\r\n    and Navy of the United States.\r\n\r\n    EDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n    Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nMcCallum commenced his duties with the staff rank of Colonel, afterwards\r\nattaining to that of Brev.-Brig.-General. The scope of the authority\r\nconferred on him, under the War Department order of February 11, 1862,\r\nwas widened a year later, when he was further appointed general manager\r\nof all railways in possession of the Federal Government, or that might\r\nfrom time to time be taken possession of by military authority, in the\r\ndepartments of the Cumberland, the Ohio, the Tennessee, and of Arkansas,\r\nforming the \"Military Division of the Mississippi.\"\r\n\r\nThe total mileage of the lines taken over by the Federal Government\r\nduring the course of the war was 2,105, namely, in Virginia, 611\r\nmiles; in the military division of the Mississippi, 1,201; and in\r\nNorth Carolina, 293. Much more was involved, however, for the Federal\r\nGovernment than a mere transfer to themselves of the ownership and\r\noperation of these lines for the duration of the war.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest disadvantages of the American railways at the\r\ntime of the Civil War lay in their differences of gauge. The various\r\ncompanies had built their lines with gauges chosen either to suit local\r\nconditions or according to the views of their own engineers, with little\r\nor no consideration for the running of through traffic on or from other\r\nlines. There were, in fact, at that time gauges of 6 ft., 5 ft. 6 in.,\r\n5 ft., 4 ft. 10 in., 4 ft. 9 in., 4 ft. 8½ in. (the standard English\r\ngauge), and various narrower gauges besides. These conditions prevailed\r\nuntil 1866, when the companies adopted a uniform gauge of 4 ft. 8½ in.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War the lack of uniformity was in full force, and\r\nmilitary transport by rail was greatly complicated in consequence. More\r\nthan one-half of the lines taken over and operated had a gauge of 5 ft.,\r\nand the remainder had a gauge of 4 ft. 8½ in., except in the case of\r\none short line, which was 5 ft. 6 in. As locomotives and rolling stock\r\nadapted to one gauge were unsuited to any other, the obligations falling\r\nupon the Director and General Manager of the Federal Military Railways\r\nincluded that of taking up the lines of certain companies which had\r\nadopted the 5 ft. gauge, and relaying them with the 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge,\r\nso that the same rolling stock could be used as on lines connecting with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, therefore, the Civil War in America taught the lesson that\r\nthe actual value of rail-power as influencing warfare in one and the\r\nsame country, or on one and the same continent, may vary materially\r\naccording to whether there is uniformity or diversity of railway gauge.\r\n\r\nIn certain instances the lines taken possession of were in so\r\ndefective a condition that it was imperatively necessary to relay\r\nthem, apart altogether from any question of gauge. When McCallum was\r\nappointed General Manager of Military Railways for the Division of\r\nthe Mississippi, the main army was at Chattanooga, Tennessee, and its\r\nsupplies were being received from Nashville, 151 miles distant, over\r\nthe Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. This was necessarily the main\r\nline of supply during the subsequent campaigns from Chattanooga towards\r\nAtlanta, and from Knoxville towards South-western Virginia; yet McCallum\r\nsays of it, in the Final Report he presented to the Secretary of War in\r\n1866:--\r\n\r\n    The track was laid originally in a very imperfect manner,\r\n    with a light U-rail on wooden stringers which were badly decayed\r\n    and caused almost daily accidents by spreading apart and letting\r\n    the engines and cars drop through them.\r\n\r\nIn still other instances, lines which, though begun, were not finished,\r\nhad to be completed; in others new lines had to be constructed\r\nthroughout, or extensive sidings provided; so that once more we see\r\nthat it was not then simply a question of the Federal Government taking\r\npossession of and operating an existing complete and efficient system of\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\nWhatever, again, the condition of the lines when taken over, the\r\nrailways of both combatants were subjected to constant attack by the\r\nother side with a view to the interruption of communications, the\r\ndestruction of railway track, railway bridges, rolling stock and other\r\nrailway property being enormous.\r\n\r\nReviewing the general situation at this time, McCallum says in his\r\nreport:--\r\n\r\n    In the beginning of the war military railroads were an\r\n    experiment; and though some light as to their management had\r\n    been gleaned by the operations of 1862 and 1863, yet so little\r\n    progress had been made that the attempt to supply the army of\r\n    General Sherman in the field, construct and reconstruct the\r\n    railroad in its rear, and keep pace with its march, was regarded\r\n    by those who had the largest experience, and who had become\r\n    most familiar with the subject, as the greatest experiment of\r\n    all. The attempt to furnish an army of 100,000 men and 60,000\r\n    animals with supplies from a base 360 miles distant by one line\r\n    of single-track railroad, located almost the entire distance\r\n    through the country of an active and vindictive enemy, is\r\n    without precedent in the history of warfare; and to make it\r\n    successful required an enormous outlay for labour and a vast\r\n    consumption of material, together with all the forethought,\r\n    energy, patience and watchfulness of which men are capable.\r\n\r\nTo meet the various conditions which had thus arisen, McCallum\r\nwas authorised by the Federal Government to create two distinct\r\ndepartments, destined to bring about a still further development in the\r\napplication of rail-power to war by establishing precedents which the\r\nleading countries of the world were afterwards to follow more or less\r\ncompletely, according to their own circumstances and requirements.\r\n\r\nThe departments were known respectively as the \"Transportation\r\nDepartment,\" embracing the operation and maintenance of all the lines\r\nbrought under use by the army of the North; and the \"Construction\r\nCorps,\" which was to repair the damage done by wrecking parties of the\r\nenemy, maintain lines of communication, and reconstruct, when necessary,\r\nrailways captured from the enemy as the Federals advanced.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Construction Corps, and the great work accomplished by it\r\nin keeping the lines open, details will be given in the chapter which\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Transportation Department, it may be of interest\r\nto state that this was placed by McCallum in charge of a General\r\nSuperintendent of Transportation on United States Railroads in the\r\nMilitary Division of the Mississippi. For each of the principal lines\r\nthere was appointed a Superintendent of Transportation who, acting under\r\nthe control of the General Superintendent, was held responsible for the\r\nmovement of all trains and locomotives; and these superintendents, in\r\nturn, had under their direction one or more Masters of Transportation,\r\nwhose business it was to be constantly moving about over the sections of\r\nline placed under their charge, and see that the railway employés were\r\nattending properly to their duties.\r\n\r\nAt each of the principal stations there was an Engine Dispatcher who\r\nwas required to see that the locomotives were kept in good order and\r\nready for immediate use whenever required, to exercise control over the\r\ndrivers and firemen, and to assign the requisite \"crew\" to each engine\r\nsent out.\r\n\r\nMaintenance of road and structures for each line (as distinct from\r\nthe reconstruction work left to the Construction Department) was in\r\ncharge of a Superintendent of Repairs, assisted by such supervisors,\r\nroad-masters and foremen as he needed to control and direct his working\r\nstaff; and maintenance of rolling stock was delegated to (1) a Master\r\nMachinist, responsible for repairs to locomotives, and (2) a Master of\r\nCar Repairs.\r\n\r\nThese various officers were independent of each other, and all of\r\nthem reported direct to the General Superintendent. The maximum force\r\nemployed at any one time in the Transportation Department of the\r\nMilitary Division of the Mississippi (as distinct from the military\r\nlines in Virginia and elsewhere) was about 12,000 men.\r\n\r\nA sufficient staff of competent railwaymen for the operation of the\r\nMilitary Railways was difficult to get, partly because of the inadequate\r\nsupply of such men in the United States at that period, and partly\r\nbecause those still at work on railways not taken over for military\r\npurposes were unwilling to give up what they found to be exceptionally\r\ngood posts; but of the men whose services he was able to secure McCallum\r\nspeaks in terms of the highest commendation.\r\n\r\nHaving got his Department and Construction Corps into working order,\r\nMcCallum had next to turn his attention to ensuring an adequate supply\r\nof locomotives and cars, with the necessary shops, tools and materials\r\nfor keeping them in working order. Here the Secretary of War again\r\ncame to his help, issuing, on March 23, 1864, an Order addressed to\r\nlocomotive manufacturers in which he stated that Colonel McCallum had\r\nbeen authorised by the War Department to procure locomotives without\r\ndelay for the railways under his charge, and proceeded:--\r\n\r\n    In order to meet the wants of the Military Department of\r\n    the Government, you will deliver to his order such engines as\r\n    he may direct, whether building under orders for other parties\r\n    or otherwise, the Government being accountable to you for the\r\n    same. The urgent necessity of the Government for the immediate\r\n    supply of our armies operating in Tennessee renders the engines\r\n    indispensable for the equipment of the lines of communication,\r\n    and it is hoped that this necessity will be recognised by you as\r\n    a military necessity, paramount to all other considerations.--By\r\n    order of the President.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1864, McCallum had estimated that he would require 200\r\nlocomotives and 3,000 cars for the lines to be operated from Nashville,\r\nand towards this number he then had only 47 locomotives and 437 cars\r\navailable. There was thus a substantial shortage which had to be\r\nmade good; but the manufacturers, inspired by \"a spirit of zealous\r\npatriotism,\" responded heartily to the appeal made to them, putting\r\ntheir full force on to the completion of further supplies. These were\r\nfurnished with a speed that surpassed all previous records.\r\n\r\nThen, to maintain the locomotives and cars in good condition--more\r\nespecially in view of the constant attempts made by the enemy to destroy\r\nthem--extensive machine and car shops were built at Nashville and\r\nChattanooga. Those at Nashville--the terminal station for 500 miles\r\nof railway running south, east or west--had, at times, as many as 100\r\nengines and 1,000 cars awaiting repair.\r\n\r\nNext to that insufficiency of engines and rolling stock which hampered\r\nthe movements of both combatants came the difficulty in the way of\r\nobtaining further supplies of rails, whether for new lines or to take\r\nthe place of those which had either worn out or been so bent and twisted\r\nby the enemy that they could not be used again without re-rolling.\r\nFor the Confederates, cut off by the advance of General Grant to the\r\nsouth and west from their sources of supply, the want of iron for new\r\nrails was declared to be a worse evil than was the lack of gold for the\r\nFederals.\r\n\r\nOne expedient resorted to by the Federal Government, on finding they\r\ncould not procure from the manufacturers all the rails they wanted, was\r\nto pull up the railway lines that were not wanted for military purposes\r\nand use their rails for relaying those that were. Altogether the rails\r\non over 156 miles of track in Virginia and the Military Division of the\r\nMississippi were thus taken up and utilised elsewhere. Later on the\r\nFederal Construction Corps erected at Chattanooga some \"very superior\"\r\nrolling mills, equipped with all the latest improvements in the way of\r\nmachinery and mechanical appliances; though these mills did not actually\r\nget to work until April 1, 1865. Their production of new rails during\r\nthe course of six months from that date was 3,818 tons, this supply\r\nbeing in addition to nearly 22,000 tons which the Federal Government\r\nobtained by purchase.\r\n\r\nThese details may convey some idea of all that was involved in the\r\nutilisation of rail-power in the American Civil War under such\r\ndevelopment of railway construction as had then been brought about.\r\nGreat, however, as was the outlay, the forethought, the energy, the\r\npatience and the watchfulness spoken of by McCallum, the results were no\r\nless valuable from the point of view of the Federals, who could hardly\r\nhave hoped to achieve the aim they set before themselves--that of saving\r\nthe Union--but for the material advantages they derived from the use of\r\nthe railways for the purposes of the campaign.\r\n\r\nSome of the achievements accomplished in the movement of troops from\r\none part of the theatre of war to another would have been creditable\r\neven in the most favourable of circumstances; but they were especially\r\nso in view alike of the physical conditions of many of the lines, the\r\ninadequate supply of rolling stock, and the risks and difficulties to be\r\nmet or overcome.\r\n\r\nOne of these achievements, carried out in September, 1863, is thus\r\nnarrated in an article on \"Recollections of Secretary Stanton,\"\r\npublished in the _Century Magazine_ for March, 1887:--\r\n\r\n    The defeat of Rosecrans, at Chickamauga, was believed at\r\n    Washington to imperil East Tennessee, and the Secretary [of War]\r\n    was urged to send a strong reinforcement there from the Army\r\n    of the Potomac. General Halleck (General-in-Chief of the Army\r\n    of the United States) contended that it was impossible to get\r\n    an effective reinforcement there in time; and the President,\r\n    after hearing both sides, accepted the judgment of Halleck. Mr.\r\n    Stanton put off the decision till evening, when he and Halleck\r\n    were to be ready with details to support their conclusions.\r\n    The Secretary then sent for Colonel McCallum, who was neither\r\n    a lawyer nor a strategist, but a master of railway science. He\r\n    showed McCallum how many officers, men, horses, and pieces of\r\n    artillery, and how much baggage, it was proposed to move from\r\n    the Rapidan to the Tennessee, and asked him to name the shortest\r\n    time he would undertake to do it in if his life depended on\r\n    it. McCallum made some rapid calculations, jotted down some\r\n    projects connected with the move, and named a time within that\r\n    which Halleck had admitted would be soon enough if it were\r\n    only possible; this time being conditioned on his being able\r\n    to control everything that he could reach. The Secretary was\r\n    delighted, told him that he would make him a Brigadier-General\r\n    the day that the last train was safely unloaded; put him on his\r\n    mettle by telling him of Halleck's assertion that the thing\r\n    was beyond human power; told him to go and work out final\r\n    calculations and projects and to begin preliminary measures,\r\n    using his name and authority everywhere; and finally instructed\r\n    him what to do and say when he should send for him by and\r\n    by to come over to the department. When the conference was\r\n    resumed and McCallum was introduced, his apparently spontaneous\r\n    demonstration of how easily and surely the impossible thing\r\n    could be done convinced the two sceptics, and the movement was\r\n    ordered, and made, and figures now in military science as a\r\n    grand piece of strategy.\r\n\r\nThe feat thus accomplished was that of conveying by rail 23,000 men,\r\ntogether with artillery, road vehicles, etc., a distance of about 1,200\r\nmiles in seven days. It was estimated that if the troops had had to\r\nmarch this distance, with all their impedimenta, along such roads as\r\nwere then available, the journey would have taken them three months. By\r\ndoing it in one week they saved the situation in East Tennessee, and\r\nthey gave an especially convincing proof of the success with which \"a\r\ngrand piece of strategy\" could be carried out through the employment of\r\nrail transport.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1864, General Schofield's corps of 15,000 men, after\r\nfighting at Nashville in the midst of ice and snow, was, on the\r\nconclusion of the campaign in the west, transferred from the valley of\r\nthe Tennessee to the banks of the Potomac, moving by river and rail down\r\nthe Tennessee, up the Ohio and across the snow-covered Alleghanies,\r\na distance of 1,400 miles, accomplished in the short space of eleven\r\ndays. In 1865 the moving of the Fourth Army Corps of the Federals from\r\nCarter's Station, East Tennessee, to Nashville, a distance of 373 miles,\r\ninvolved the employment of 1,498 cars.\r\n\r\nWhat, in effect, the Civil War in America did in furthering the\r\ndevelopment of the rail-power principle in warfare was to show that,\r\nby the use of railways, (1) the fighting power of armies is increased;\r\n(2) strategical advantages unattainable but for the early arrival of\r\nreinforcements at threatened points may be assured; and (3) expeditions\r\nmay be undertaken at distances from the base of supplies which would\r\nbe prohibitive but for the control of lines of railway communication;\r\nthough as against these advantages were to be put those considerations\r\nwhich also arose as to destruction and restoration, and as to the\r\ncontrol of railways in their operation for military purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRAILWAY DESTRUCTION IN WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest and most obvious criticisms advanced against the\r\nuse of railways in war was based on the vulnerability of the iron\r\nroad. The destruction of a bridge, the tearing up of a few rails or\r\nthe blocking of a tunnel would, it was argued, suffice to cause an\r\ninterruption in the transport of troops or supplies which might be of\r\nserious consequence to the combatants prejudiced thereby, though of\r\ncorresponding advantage to the other side. By means of such interruption\r\nthe concentration of troops on the frontier might be delayed; an army\r\nmight be divided into two or more parts, and exposed to the risk of\r\ndefeat in detail; the arrival of reinforcements urgently wanted to\r\nmeet a critical situation might be prevented until it was too late for\r\nthem to afford the desired relief; a force advancing into an enemy's\r\ncountry might have its rail connection severed and be left to starve\r\nor to surrender at discretion; invaders would find that the force they\r\nwere driving before them had taken the precaution to destroy their\r\nown railways as they retreated; or, alternatively, lines of railway\r\nconstructed to the frontier, and depended upon to facilitate invasion of\r\nneighbouring territory, might--unless destroyed--be of material service\r\nto the enemy, should the latter become the invaders instead of the\r\ninvaded.\r\n\r\nWhile these and other possibilities--foreshadowed more especially in\r\nthe controversies which the whole subject aroused in Germany in the\r\n'Forties--were frankly admitted, it was argued that, however vulnerable\r\nrailways might be as a line of communication, it should be quite\r\npossible either to defend them successfully or to carry out on them\r\nsuch speedy repairs or reconstruction as would, generally speaking,\r\npermit of an early resumption of traffic; though experience was to show\r\nthat these safeguards could only be assured through a well-planned and\r\nthoroughly efficient organisation prepared to meet, with the utmost\r\ndispatch and the highest degree of efficiency, all the requirements in\r\nthe way of railway repairs or railway rebuilding that were likely to\r\narise.\r\n\r\nThe earliest instance of an attempt to delay the advance of an enemy\r\nby interrupting his rail communications was recorded in 1848, when the\r\nVenetians, threatened with bombardment by the Austrians, destroyed\r\nsome of the arches in the railway viaduct connecting their island city\r\nwith the mainland. Then in the _Italian campaign of 1859_ the allies\r\nand the Austrians both resorted to the expedient of destroying railway\r\nbridges or tearing up the railway lines; although the allies were able,\r\nin various instances, to repair so speedily the damage done by the\r\nAustrians that the lines were ready for use again by the time they were\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nIt was the _American Civil War_ that was to elevate railway destruction\r\nand restoration into a science and to see the establishment, in the\r\ninterests of such science, of an organisation which was to become a\r\nmodel for European countries and influence the whole subsequent course\r\nof modern warfare.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of railways likely to be used by the North for its\r\nprojected invasion of the Confederate States was, from the first,\r\na leading feature in the strategy of the South. Expeditions were\r\nundertaken and raids were made with no other object than that of\r\nburning down bridges, tearing up and bending rails, making bonfires of\r\nsleepers, wrecking stations, rendering engines, trucks and carriages\r\nunserviceable, cutting off the water supply for locomotives, or in\r\nvarious other ways seeking to check the advance of the Northerners.\r\nLater on the Federals, in turn, became no less energetic in resorting to\r\nsimilar tactics in order either to prevent pursuit by the Confederates\r\nor to interrupt their communications.\r\n\r\nFor the carrying out of these destructive tactics use was generally made\r\neither of cavalry, accompanied by civilians, or of bodies of civilians\r\nonly; but in some instances, when it was considered desirable to destroy\r\nlengths of track extending to twenty or thirty miles, or more, the\r\nConfederates put the whole of their available forces on to the work.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the methods of destruction were somewhat primitive; but\r\nthey were improved upon as the result of practice and experiment.\r\n\r\nThus, in the first instance, timber bridges or viaducts were destroyed\r\nby collecting brushwood, placing this around the arches, pouring tar or\r\npetroleum upon the pile, and then setting fire to the whole. Afterwards\r\nthe Federals made use of a \"torpedo,\" eight inches long, and charged\r\nwith gunpowder, which was inserted in a hole bored in the main timbers\r\nof the bridge and exploded with a fuse. It was claimed that with two or\r\nthree men working at each span the largest timber bridge could be thrown\r\ndown in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThen the method generally adopted at first for destroying a railway\r\ntrack was to tear up sleepers and rails, place the sleepers in a heap,\r\nput the rails cross-ways over them, set fire to the sleepers, and heat\r\nthe rails until they either fell out of shape or could be twisted around\r\na tree with the help of chains and horses. But this process was found\r\nto require too much time and labour, while the results were not always\r\nsatisfactory, since rails only slightly bent could be restored to\r\ntheir original shape, and made ready for use again, in much less time\r\nthan it had taken for the fire to heat and bend them. A Federal expert\r\naccordingly invented an ingenious contrivance, in the form of iron\r\nU-shaped \"claws,\" which, being turned up and over at each extremity,\r\nwere inserted underneath each end of a rail, on opposite sides, and\r\noperated, with the help of a long wooden lever and rope, by half a dozen\r\nmen. In this way a rail could be torn from the sleepers and not only\r\nbent but given such a spiral or corkscrew twist, while still in the cold\r\nstate, that it could not be used again until it had gone through the\r\nrolling mills. By the adoption of this method, 440 men could destroy\r\none mile of track in an hour, or 2,200 men could, in the same time,\r\ndestroy five miles.\r\n\r\nThe most effective method for rendering a locomotive unfit for service\r\nwas found to be the firing of a cannon ball through the boiler.\r\nCarriages and wagons which might otherwise be used by the enemy, and\r\ncould not be conveniently carried off, were easily destroyed by fire.\r\nIn one period of six months the Federals disposed of 400 in this way.\r\nStations, water-tanks, sleepers, fuel and telegraph poles were also\r\ndestroyed or rendered useless by fire or otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of the war--1861--the Confederates gave the Federals a\r\nforetaste of much that was to come by destroying forty-eight locomotives\r\non the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and making a complete wreck of 100\r\nmiles of the North Missouri Railroad track and everything thereon.\r\n\r\nMuch more serious than this, however, from a strategical point of\r\nview, was the wholesale destruction carried out by the Confederates,\r\nin April, 1862, on the Fredericksburg Railway, connecting Richmond\r\nand Washington, the immediate result of the mischief done being to\r\nprevent an impending combination between the Federal armies of the\r\nPotomac and the Rappahannock, neither of which could act without the\r\nother, while neither could join the other unless it could make use\r\nof rail communication. There was much that required to be done, for\r\nthe Confederates had carried out their work in a most thorough-going\r\nfashion. Several indispensable railway bridges had been destroyed; three\r\nmiles of track had been torn up, the rails being carried south and the\r\nsleepers burned; and wharves and buildings had been burned or wrecked.\r\nThe whole transportation service, in fact, had been reduced to a state\r\nof chaos.\r\n\r\nAt the urgent request of the Secretary of War, the work of restoration\r\nwas undertaken by Mr. Herman Haupt, a railway engineer who had already\r\ndistinguished himself more especially as a builder of bridges, and was\r\nnow to establish a further record as the pioneer of those Construction\r\nCorps of which so much was to be heard later on in connection with\r\nrailways and war.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out the necessary repairs the only help which Haupt could\r\nobtain, at first, was that of soldiers detailed from the Federal ranks.\r\nMany of these men were entirely unaccustomed to physical labour; others\r\nwere sickly, inefficient, or unwilling to undertake what they did not\r\nregard as a soldier's duties, while the Army officers sent in a fresh\r\nlot daily until Haupt's remonstrances led to their allotting certain\r\nmen to form a \"Construction Corps.\" Other difficulties which presented\r\nthemselves included an insufficient supply of tools, occasional scarcity\r\nof food, and several days of wet weather; yet the work advanced so\r\nrapidly that the Akakeek bridge, a single span of 120 ft., at an\r\nelevation of 30 ft., was rebuilt in about fifteen working hours; the\r\nPotomac Creek bridge, 414 ft. long with an elevation of 82 ft. above\r\nthe water, and requiring the use of as much roughly-hewn timber as\r\nwould have extended a total length of six and a half miles, if put end\r\nto end, was completed in nine days;[5] and the three miles of track\r\nwere relaid in three days, included in the work done in that time being\r\nthe preparation of more than 3,000 sleepers from lumber cut down for\r\nthe purpose in woods a mile and a half distant from the track. General\r\nMcDowell subsequently said, concerning the Potomac bridge:--\r\n\r\n    When it is considered that in the campaigns of Napoleon\r\n    trestle bridges of more than one story, even of moderate\r\n    height, were regarded as impracticable, and that, too, for\r\n    common military roads, it is not difficult to understand why\r\n    distinguished Europeans should express surprise at so bold a\r\n    specimen of American military engineering. It is a structure\r\n    which ignores all rules and precedents of military science as\r\n    laid down in the books. It is constructed chiefly of round\r\n    sticks cut from the woods, and not even divested of bark; the\r\n    legs of the trestles are braced with round poles. It is in four\r\n    stories--three of trestle and one of crib work.\r\n\r\nWhile constructed in so apparently primitive a fashion, the bridge was,\r\nGeneral McDowell further said, carrying every day from ten to twenty\r\nheavy railway trains in both directions, and had withstood several\r\nsevere freshets and storms without injury.\r\n\r\nThus early, therefore, in the more active phases of the Civil War,\r\nevidence was being afforded that, although the railways on which so\r\nmuch depended might be readily destroyed, they could, also, be rapidly\r\nrestored; and subsequent experience was to offer proofs still more\r\nremarkable in support of this fact.\r\n\r\nOn May 28, 1862, Haupt was appointed Chief of Construction and\r\nTransportation in the Department of the Rappahannock, with the rank of\r\nColonel. He was raised to the rank of Brigadier-General in the following\r\nyear, and did much excellent construction and other work for the\r\nGovernment, though mainly in Virginia, down to September, 1863. In his\r\n\"Reminiscences\" he relates that the supplies of repair or reconstruction\r\nmaterials, as kept on hand by the Federals, included the interchangeable\r\nparts of bridge trusses, in spans of 60 ft., and so prepared that, taken\r\non flat cars, by ox-teams or otherwise, to the place where they were\r\nwanted, and hoisted into position by machinery arranged for the purpose,\r\nthey could, without previous fitting, be put together with such rapidity\r\nthat one of his foremen claimed to be able to build a bridge \"about as\r\nfast as a dog could trot.\" When the Massaponix bridge, six miles from\r\nFredericksburg, was burned down one Monday morning, a new one was put\r\nup in its place in half a day--a feat which, he says, led some of the\r\nonlookers to exclaim, \"The Yankees can build bridges quicker than the\r\nRebs can burn them down.\" In May, 1862, five bridges over Goose Creek\r\nwhich the \"Rebs\" had destroyed were reconstructed in a day and a half.\r\nIn the following month five other bridges, each with a span of from 60\r\nft. to 120 ft., were renewed in one day. At the Battle of Gettysburg\r\nLee's troops destroyed nineteen bridges on the Northern Central Railroad\r\nand did much havoc on the branch lines leading to Gettysburg; but the\r\nConstruction Corps was hard at work on the repairs whilst the battle\r\nwas still being waged, and rail communication with both Washington and\r\nBaltimore had been re-established by noon of the day after Lee's retreat.\r\n\r\nIn some instances railway bridges underwent repeated destruction and\r\nreconstruction. By June, 1863, the bridge over Bull Run, for instance,\r\nhad been burned down and built up again no fewer than seven times. Many\r\nof the bridges, also, were swept away by floods, and this even for a\r\nsecond or a third time after they had been rebuilt. Precautions thus\r\nhad to be taken against the destructive forces of Nature no less than\r\nagainst those of man.\r\n\r\nHaupt's pioneer Construction Corps in Virginia was succeeded by the\r\none set up on much broader lines by McCallum when, in February, 1864,\r\nhe became General Manager of railways in the Military Division of the\r\nMississippi. This corps eventually reached a total of 10,000 men.\r\n\r\n\"The design of the corps,\" wrote McCallum, in his final report, \"was\r\nto combine a body of skilled workmen in each department of railroad\r\nconstruction and repairs, under competent engineers, supplied with\r\nabundant materials, tools and mechanical appliances.\" The corps was\r\nformed into divisions the number of which varied from time to time, in\r\ndifferent districts, according to requirements. In the military division\r\nof the Mississippi the corps comprised six divisions, under the general\r\ncharge of the chief engineer of the United States military railroads\r\nfor that military division, and consisted at its maximum strength of\r\nnearly 5,000 men. In order to give the corps entire mobility, and to\r\nenable it to move independently and undertake work at widely different\r\npoints, each of the six divisions was made a complete unit, under\r\nthe command of a divisional engineer, and was, in turn, divided into\r\nsub-divisions or sections, with a supervisor in charge of each. The\r\ntwo largest and most important sub-divisions in any one division were\r\nthose of the track-layers and the bridge-builders. A sub-division was,\r\nagain, composed of gangs, each with a foreman, while the gangs were\r\ndivided into squads, each with a sub-foreman.[6] Under this method of\r\norganisation it was possible to move either the entire division or any\r\nsection thereof, with its tools, camp requirements and field transport,\r\nin any direction, wherever and whenever needed, and by any mode of\r\nconveyance--rail, road, with teams and wagons, or on foot.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the operations of the corps, supplies of materials were\r\nkept at points along or within a short distance of the railway lines,\r\nwhere they would be comparatively safe and speedily procurable in\r\ncase of necessity. At places where there was special need for taking\r\nprecautionary measures, detachments of the corps were stationed in\r\nreadiness for immediate action, while on important lines of railway\r\nFederals and Confederates alike had, at each end thereof, construction\r\ntrains loaded with every possible requisite, the locomotives attached\r\nto them keeping their steam up in order that the trains could be\r\nstarted off instantly on the receipt of a telegram announcing a further\r\ninterruption of traffic.\r\n\r\nAt Nashville and Chattanooga the Federals built extensive storehouses\r\nwhere they kept on hand supplies of materials for the prompt carrying\r\nout of railway repairs of every kind to any extent and in whatever\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOn the Nashville and Chattanooga Railway itself the Construction Corps,\r\nfrom February, 1864, to the close of the war, relaid 115 miles of\r\ntrack, put in nineteen miles of new sidings, eight miles apart and each\r\ncapable of holding from five to eight long freight trains, and erected\r\nforty-five new water tanks.\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction of this particular line was more especially needed\r\nin connection with General Sherman's campaign in Georgia and the\r\nCarolinas--a campaign which afforded the greatest and most direct\r\nevidence up to that time alike of the possibilities of rail-power\r\nin warfare, of the risks by which its use was attended, and of the\r\nsuccess with which those risks could be overcome by means of efficient\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\nIn that struggle for Atlanta which preceded his still more famous march\r\nto the sea, Sherman had with him a force of 100,000 men, together with\r\n23,000 animals. His base of supplies, when he approached Atlanta, was\r\n360 miles distant, and the continuance of his communications with that\r\nbase, not only for the procuring of food, clothing, fodder, ammunition\r\nand every other requisite, but for the transport to the rear of sick\r\nand wounded, refugees, freedmen and prisoners, depended on what he\r\nafterwards described as \"a poorly-constructed single-track railroad\"\r\npassing for 120 miles of its length through the country of an extremely\r\nactive enemy. Yet Sherman is said to have made his advance in perfect\r\nconfidence that, although subject to interruptions, the railway in his\r\nrear would be \"all right\"; and this confidence was fully warranted by\r\nthe results accomplished.\r\n\r\nEarly in September, 1864, the Confederate General, Wheeler, destroyed\r\nseven miles of road between Nashville and Murfreesboro', on the\r\nNashville and Chattanooga Railway, and in the following December Hood\r\ndestroyed eight miles of track and 530 ft. of bridges between the same\r\nstations; yet the arrangements of the Federal Construction Corps allowed\r\nof the repairs being carried out with such promptness that in each\r\ninstance the trains were running again in a few days.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate attacks on the Western and Atlantic Railway, running\r\nfrom Chattanooga at Atlanta, a distance of 136 miles, were more\r\ncontinuous and more severe than on any other line of railway during\r\nthe war; but, thanks again to the speed with which the repair and\r\nreconstruction work was done, the delays occasioned were, as a rule, of\r\nonly a few hours, or, at the most, a few days' duration. One especially\r\nremarkable feat accomplished on this line was the rebuilding, in four\r\nand a half days, of the Chattahochee bridge, near Atlanta--a structure\r\n780 ft. long, and 92 ft. high. Hood, the Confederate General, thought\r\nstill further to check Sherman's communications by passing round the\r\nFederal army and falling upon the railway in its rear. He succeeded\r\nin tearing up two lengths of track, one of ten miles, and another of\r\ntwenty-five miles, in extent, and destroying 250 ft. of bridges; but\r\nonce more the work of restoration was speedily carried out, McCallum\r\nsaying in reference to it:--\r\n\r\n    Fortunately the detachments of the Construction Corps which\r\n    escaped were so distributed that even before Hood had left the\r\n    road two strong working parties were at work, one at each end of\r\n    the break at Big Shanty, and this gap of ten miles was closed,\r\n    and the force ready to move to the great break of twenty-five\r\n    miles in length, north of Resaca, as soon as the enemy had left\r\n    it. The destruction by Hood's army of our depôts of supplies\r\n    compelled us to cut nearly all the cross-ties required to relay\r\n    this track and to send a distance for rails. The cross-ties were\r\n    cut near the line of the road and many of them carried by hand\r\n    to the track, as the teams to be furnished for hauling them did\r\n    not get to the work until it was nearly complete. The rails used\r\n    on the southern end of the break had to be taken up and brought\r\n    from the railroads south of Atlanta, and those for the northern\r\n    end were mostly brought from Nashville, nearly 200 miles distant.\r\n\r\n    Notwithstanding all the disadvantages under which the labour\r\n    was performed, this twenty-five miles of track was laid, and the\r\n    trains were running over it in seven and a half days from the\r\n    time the work was commenced.\r\n\r\nConcluding, however, that it would be unwise to depend on the railway\r\nduring his further march to the sea, Sherman collected at Atlanta, by\r\nmeans of the restored lines, the supplies he wanted for 600,000 men,\r\nsent to the rear all the men and material no longer required, and\r\nthen, before starting for Savannah, destroyed sixty miles of track\r\nbehind him in so effectual a manner that it would be impossible for the\r\nConfederates--especially in view of their own great lack, at this time,\r\nof rails, locomotives and rolling stock--to repair and utilise the\r\nlines again in any attempted pursuit. It was, in fact, as much to his\r\nadvantage now to destroy the railways in his rear as it had previously\r\nbeen to repair and rebuild them.\r\n\r\nAll through Georgia, for the 300 miles from Atlanta to Savannah (where\r\nhe was able to establish communications with the Federal fleet), Sherman\r\ncontinued the same tactics of railway destruction; and he resumed them\r\nwhen his army, now divided into three columns, turned northward to\r\neffect a junction with Grant at Richmond.\r\n\r\nOn this northward march, also, there was no need for Sherman to make a\r\ndirect attack on Charleston. By destroying about sixty miles of track\r\nin and around Branchville--a village on the South Carolina Railroad\r\nwhich formed a junction where the line from Charleston branched off in\r\nthe directions of Columbia and Augusta respectively--one of Sherman's\r\ncolumns severed Charleston from all its sources of supply in the\r\ninterior, and left the garrison with no alternative but to surrender.\r\nCommenting on this event, Vigo-Rouissillon remarks, in his \"Puissance\r\nMilitaire des États-Unis d'Amérique\":--\r\n\r\n    Ainsi il avait suffi de la destruction ou de la possession\r\n    de quelques kilomètres de chemin de fer pour amener la chute de\r\n    ce boulevard de l'insurrection, qui avait si longtemps résisté\r\n    aux plus puissantes flottes du Nord. Exemple frappant du rôle\r\n    reservé dans nos guerres modernes à ce precieux et fragile moyen\r\n    de communication.\r\n\r\nIn the aggregate, Sherman's troops destroyed hundreds of miles of\r\nrailway track in their progress through what had previously been\r\nregarded as a veritable stronghold of the enemy's country; though\r\nmeanwhile the Construction Corps had repaired and reopened nearly 300\r\nmiles of railway in North Carolina and had built a wharf, covering an\r\narea of 54,000 square feet, at the ocean terminus of the Atlantic and\r\nNorth Carolina Railroad in order both to facilitate Sherman's progress\r\nnorthwards, by the time of his reaching the lines in question, and to\r\nenable him to obtain supplies from the fleet. The railways, in fact,\r\ncontributed greatly to the brilliant success of Sherman's campaign, and\r\nhence, also, to the final triumph of the Federal cause.\r\n\r\nThe total length of track laid or relaid by the Federal Construction\r\nCorps during the continuance of the war was 641 miles, and the lineal\r\nfeet of bridges built or rebuilt was equal to twenty-six miles. The\r\nnet expenditure, in respect alike to construction and transportation,\r\nincurred by the department in charge of the railways during their\r\ncontrol by the Government for military purposes was close on $30,000,000.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the interruption of railway communication became a\r\nrecognised phase of warfare all the world over; and, not only have\r\nnumerous treatises been written on the subject in various languages, but\r\nthe creation of special forces to deal alike with the destruction and\r\nthe restoration of railways has become an important and indispensable\r\nfeature of military organisation. These matters will be dealt with more\r\nfully in subsequent chapters; but it may be of interest if reference\r\nis made here to the experiences of _Mexico_, as further illustrating\r\nthe universality of practices with which, in her case, at least, no\r\neffective measures had been taken to deal.\r\n\r\n\"How Mexican Rebels Destroy Railways and Bridges\" was told by Mr. G.\r\nE. Weekes in the _Scientific American_ for September 13, 1913, and the\r\nsubject was further dealt with by Major Charles Hine in a paper on \"War\r\nTime Railroading in Mexico,\" read by him before the St. Louis Railway\r\nClub, on October 10, 1913. The term \"rebels\" applies, of course, in\r\nMexico to the party that is against the particular President who is in\r\noffice for the time being; and in the revolutionary period lasting from\r\n1910 to 1913 the \"rebels\" of the moment found plenty to do in the way\r\nof destroying railways not only, as in other countries, in order to\r\nretard the advance of their pursuers, but, also, to spite the national\r\nGovernment, who control about two-thirds of the stock in the railways of\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the mischief done by one party or the other during the\r\nperiod in question included the destruction of many hundreds of miles of\r\ntrack; the burning or the dynamiting of hundreds of bridges, according\r\nas these had been built of timber or of steel; and the wrecking of many\r\nstations and over 50 per cent. of the rolling stock on the national\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nConcerning the methods adopted in the carrying out of this work, Mr.\r\nWeekes, who had the opportunity of seeing track and bridge destruction\r\nin full progress, says:--\r\n\r\n    Up to the past six months track destruction had been\r\n    accompanied either by the use of a wrecking crane, which lifted\r\n    sections of rails and ties (sleepers) bodily and piled them up\r\n    ready for burning, or by the slower process of the claw-bar,\r\n    wrench and pick. But a Constitutionalist expert devised a new\r\n    system.\r\n\r\n    A trench is dug between two ties, through which a heavy\r\n    chain is passed around two opposite rails and made fast in the\r\n    centre of the track. To this one end of a heavy steel cable is\r\n    hooked, the other end being made fast to the coupling on the\r\n    engine pilot. At the signal the engineman starts his locomotive\r\n    slowly backward, and as they are huge 220-ton \"consolidations,\"\r\n    with 22-inch by 30-inch cylinders, one can easily imagine that\r\n    something has to give. And it does! The rails are torn loose\r\n    from the spikes that hold them to the ties and are dragged\r\n    closely together in the centre of the road bed. The ties are\r\n    loosened from the ballast and dragged into piles, while in many\r\n    cases the rails are badly bent and twisted by the force applied.\r\n    A gang of men follows the engine, piling ties on top of the line\r\n    and leaving others beneath them. These are then saturated with\r\n    oil and a match applied. In a short time the ties are consumed\r\n    and the rails left lying on the ground twisted and contorted\r\n    into all sorts of shapes and of no further use until after they\r\n    have been re-rolled.\r\n\r\nAs for the bridges, those of timber were saturated with oil and burned,\r\nwhile in the case of steel bridges rows of holes were bored horizontally\r\nin the lower part of the piers and charged with dynamite, which was then\r\nexploded by means of fuses connected with batteries of the type used in\r\nMexican coal mines.\r\n\r\nAnother favourite method adopted for interfering with transportation\r\nby rail was that of attacking a train, compelling it to stop, taking\r\npossession of the locomotive, and burning the cars.\r\n\r\nThere is no suggestion by either of the authorities mentioned above\r\nof any well-organised Construction Corps in Mexico repairing damage\r\ndone on the railway almost as quickly as it could be effected by the\r\ndestroyers. Mr. Weekes believed, rather, that it would take years to\r\nrestore the roads to the condition they were in before the rebellion\r\nagainst President Diaz, and he further declared that it would cost\r\nthe national lines of Mexico many millions of dollars to replace the\r\ndestroyed rolling stock, bridges, stations, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] In May, 1864, when this bridge had been again destroyed, it was\r\nrebuilt, ready for trains to pass over, in forty working hours.\r\n\r\n[6] A division, completely organised, consisted of 777 officers and\r\nmen, as follows:--Division engineer, assistant engineer, rodman,\r\nclerk, and 2 messengers (6). Sub-division I: Supervisor of bridges and\r\ncarpenters' work, clerk and time-keeper, commissionary (taking charge\r\nof transport and issue of rations), quartermaster (in charge of tools,\r\ncamp equipment, etc.), surgeon, hospital steward, 6 foremen (1 for\r\neach 50 men), 30 sub-foremen (1 for each 10 men), 300 mechanics and\r\nlabourers, blacksmith and helper, and 12 cooks (356). Sub-division II:\r\nSupervisor of track, and remainder of staff as in Sub-division I (356).\r\nSub-division III: Supervisor of water stations, foreman, 12 mechanics\r\nand labourers, and cook (15). Sub-division IV: Supervisor of masonry,\r\nforeman, 10 masons and helpers, and cook (13). Sub-division V: Foreman\r\nof ox-brigade, 18 ox-drivers, and cook (20). Train crew: 2 conductors, 4\r\nbrakesmen, 2 locomotive engineers, 2 firemen, and cook (11).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCONTROL OF RAILWAYS IN WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nCurtailment of the efficiency of railways during war may be due to\r\nfriend no less than to foe; and there have been occasions when, of the\r\ntwo, it is the friend who has caused the greater degree of trouble,\r\nhindrance and interruption.\r\n\r\nThese conditions have arisen mainly from three causes--(1) questions of\r\ncontrol; (2) irregularities in the employment of railway material; and\r\n(3) absence or inadequacy of organisation for military rail-transport\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nWhen the use of railways becomes an essential factor in the conduct of\r\nwar, it may appear only natural that the military authority charged with\r\nthe duty of furthering or defending national interests should, through\r\nthe Government concerned, have power to command the transport facilities\r\nof all railway lines the use of which may be necessary for the movement\r\nof troops or other military purposes.\r\n\r\nYet, while the soundness of the principle here involved is beyond\r\ndispute, there is much to be said as to the circumstances and conditions\r\nunder which a military control of railways should be exercised.\r\n\r\nIt is, in the first place, especially necessary to bear in mind that the\r\nrailway, as a means of transport, must needs be regarded from a point of\r\nview wholly different from that which would apply to ordinary roads. On\r\nthe latter any sort of vehicle can be used, and there are, generally,\r\nalternative roads along which traffic can pass, in case of need.\r\nRailroads are not only available exclusively for vehicles constructed\r\nto run upon them, but the degree of their usefulness is limited by\r\nsuch considerations as the number of separate routes to a given\r\ndestination; the important matters of detail as to whether the lines are\r\nsingle track or double track and whether they are on the level or have\r\nheavy gradients; the number of locomotives and the amount of rolling\r\nstock available; the extent of the station and siding accommodation;\r\nthe provision or non-provision of adequate facilities for loading and\r\nunloading; and, in war time, the damage or destruction of a particular\r\nline or lines by the enemy. The amount of traffic it is possible to\r\nconvey between certain points in a given time may thus be wholly\r\ncontrolled by the physical conditions of the railway concerned, and such\r\nconditions may be incapable of modification by the railway staffs, in\r\ncase of a sudden emergency, however great their desire to do everything\r\nthat is in their power.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, all these physical conditions may vary on different\r\nrailway systems, and even on different sections of the same system.\r\nIt does not, therefore, necessarily follow that military requirements\r\nwhich can be complied with on one line or in one district can be\r\nresponded to as readily, if at all, under another and totally different\r\nset of conditions elsewhere; though it is conceivable that a military\r\ncommander or officer who fails to realise this fact may, if he is\r\nleft to deal direct with the railway people, become very angry indeed\r\nat non-compliance with his demands, and resent protests that what he\r\nasks for cannot be done at one place although it may have been done at\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThen a railway must be regarded as a delicate piece of transportation\r\nmachinery which can easily be thrown out of order, and is capable\r\nof being worked only by railwaymen as skilled in the knowledge of\r\nits mechanism, and as experienced in the details of its complicated\r\noperation, as military officers themselves are assumed to be in the\r\ntechnicalities of their own particular duties. The Chief Goods Manager\r\nof a leading line of railway who offered to take the place of a General\r\nat the seat of war would arouse much mirth in the Army at his own\r\nexpense. It is, nevertheless, quite conceivable that the General would\r\nhimself not be a complete success as a Chief Goods Manager. In the\r\nearliest days of railways it was assumed that the men best qualified\r\nboth to manage them and to control the large staffs to be employed would\r\nbe retired Army officers. This policy was, in fact, adopted for a time,\r\nthough it was abandoned, after a fair trial, in favour of appointing\r\nas responsible railway officers men who had undergone training in\r\nthe railway service, and were practically acquainted alike with its\r\nfundamental principles and its technical details.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of this delicate and complicated piece of machinery\r\ndislocation of traffic may result from a variety of causes, even\r\nwhen such operation is conducted by men of the greatest experience\r\nin railway working; but the risk, alike of blocks and interruptions\r\nand of accidents involving loss of life or destruction of valuable\r\nproperty must needs be materially increased if military commanders, or\r\nofficers, themselves having no practical knowledge of railway working,\r\nand influenced only by an otherwise praiseworthy zeal for the interests\r\nof their own service, should have power either to force a responsible\r\nrailwayman to do something which he, with his greater technical\r\nknowledge, knows to be impracticable, or to hamper and interfere with\r\nthe working of the line at a time of exceptional strain on its resources.\r\n\r\nUnder, again, a misapprehension of the exact bearing of the principle\r\nof military control of railways for military operations in time of\r\nwar, there was developed in various campaigns a tendency on the part\r\nof commanders and subordinate officers (1) to look upon railways and\r\nrailwaymen as subject to their personal command, if not, even, to their\r\nown will, pleasure and convenience, so long as the war lasted; (2)\r\nto consider that every order they themselves gave should be at once\r\ncarried out, regardless either of orders from other directions or of\r\nany question as to the possibility of complying therewith; and (3) to\r\nindulge in merciless denunciations, even if not in measures still more\r\nvigorous, when their orders have not been obeyed.\r\n\r\nApart from other considerations, all these things have a direct bearing\r\non the efficiency of the railway itself as an instrument in the\r\ncarrying on of warfare; and it is, therefore, a matter of essential\r\nimportance to our present study to see how the difficulties in question\r\nhad their rise, the development they have undergone, and the steps that\r\nhave been taken to overcome or to guard against them.\r\n\r\nIt was once more in the _American Civil War_ that the control problem\r\nfirst arose in a really acute degree.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle adopted for the operation of the railways\r\ntaken possession of by the Federal Government for military purposes\r\nwas that they should be conducted under orders issued by the Secretary\r\nof War or by Army commanders in or out of the field. It was for the\r\nQuartermaster's department to load all material upon the cars, to direct\r\nwhere such material should be taken, and to arrange for unloading and\r\ndelivery; but _because_ the Government had taken possession of the\r\nrailways; _because_ the Quartermaster's department was to discharge the\r\nduties mentioned; and _because_ the railways were to be used during the\r\nwar for the transport of troops and of Army supplies, therefore certain\r\nof the officers came to the conclusion that the whole operation of the\r\nparticular lines in which they were concerned should be left either to\r\nthemselves individually or to the Quartermaster's department.\r\n\r\nAmong those holding this view was General Pope, who, on taking over the\r\ncommand of the Rappahannock Division, on June 26, 1862, disregarded\r\nthe position held by Herman Haupt as \"Chief of Construction and\r\nTransportation\" in that Division, gave him no instructions, and left him\r\nto conclude that the Army could get on very well without his assistance\r\nas a mere railwayman. Thereupon Haupt went home. Ten days afterwards\r\nhe received from the Assistant-Secretary of War a telegram which\r\nsaid:--\"Come back immediately. Cannot get on without you. Not a wheel\r\nmoving.\" Haupt went back, and he found that, what with mismanagement of\r\nthe lines and the attacks made on them by Confederates, not a wheel was,\r\nindeed, moving in the Division. His own position strengthened by his now\r\nbeing put in \"exclusive charge of all the railways within the limits\r\nof the Army of Virginia,\" he was soon able to set the wheels running\r\nagain; and from that time General Pope exercised a wise discretion in\r\nleaving the details of railway transportation to men who understood them.\r\n\r\nThen there was a General Sturgis who, when Haupt called on him one\r\nday, received him with the intimation, \"I have just sent a guard to\r\nyour office to put you under arrest for disobedience of my orders in\r\nfailing to transport my command.\" It was quite true. Haupt had failed\r\nto obey his orders. Sturgis wanted some special trains to convey 10,000\r\nmen, with horses and baggage, the short distance of eighteen miles.\r\nThe railway was a single-track line; it had only a limited equipment\r\nof engines and cars; there was the prospect of further immediate\r\nrequirements in other directions, and Haupt took the liberty of thinking\r\nthat he had better keep his transportation for more pressing needs than\r\na journey to a prospective battle-field only eighteen miles away--the\r\nmore so as if the men were attacked whilst they were in the train they\r\nwould be comparatively helpless, whereas if they were attacked when on\r\nthe road--doing what amounted to no more than a single day's march--they\r\nwould be ready for immediate defence. These considerations suggest that,\r\nof the two, the railwayman was a better strategist than the General.\r\n\r\nSturgis followed up his intimation to Haupt by taking military\r\npossession of the railway and issuing some orders which any one\r\npossessing the most elementary knowledge of railway operation would have\r\nknown to be impracticable. Meanwhile Haupt appealed by telegraph to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, who replied:--\"No military officer has any authority\r\nto interfere with your control over railroad. Show this to General\r\nSturgis, and, if he attempts to interfere, I will arrest him.\" Told what\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief said in his message, Sturgis exclaimed, \"He does,\r\ndoes he? Well, then, take your damned railroad!\"\r\n\r\nHaupt found it possible to put at the disposal of Sturgis, early the\r\nfollowing morning, the transportation asked for; but at two o'clock\r\nin the afternoon the cars were still unoccupied. On the attention of\r\nSturgis being called to this fact he replied that he had given his\r\norders but they had been disobeyed. Thereupon the cars were withdrawn\r\nfor service elsewhere--the more so since no other traffic could pass\r\nuntil they had been cleared out of the way. The net results of the\r\nGeneral's interference was that traffic on the lines was deranged for\r\ntwenty-four hours, and 10,000 men were prevented from taking part in an\r\nengagement, as they might have done had they gone by road.\r\n\r\nOf the varied and almost unending irregularities which occurred in the\r\nworking of the lines as military railways during the progress of the\r\nsame war a few other examples may be given.\r\n\r\nOne prolific source of trouble was the detention or appropriation\r\nof trains by officers who did not think it necessary to communicate\r\nfirst with the Superintendent of the Line. A certain General who did\r\ninform the Superintendent when he wanted a train was, nevertheless, in\r\nthe habit of keeping it waiting for several hours before he made his\r\nappearance, traffic being meanwhile suspended, in consequence.\r\n\r\nSpecial consideration was even claimed for officers' wives, as well as\r\nfor the officers themselves. On one occasion Haupt was much disturbed by\r\nthe non-arrival of a train bringing supplies which were urgently wanted\r\nfor a body of troops starting on a march, and he went along the line to\r\nsee what had happened. Coming at last to the train, which had pulled\r\nup, he made inquiries of the engine-driver, who told him that he had\r\nreceived instructions to stop at a certain point so that an officer's\r\nwife, who was coming in the train to see her husband on the eve of an\r\nengagement, could go to a neighbouring town to look out for rooms for\r\nherself. At that moment the lady put in an appearance. She took her seat\r\nagain and the train then proceeded; but her side-trip in search of rooms\r\nmeant a delay of three hours alike for this one train and for three\r\nothers following behind.\r\n\r\nThe impression seems to have prevailed, also, that officers were at\r\nliberty to make any use of the trains they pleased for the conveyance\r\nof their own belongings. To check the abuses thus developed, Haupt was\r\ncompelled to issue, on June 25, 1862, the following notice:--\r\n\r\n    Assistant Quartermasters and Commissaries are positively\r\n    forbidden to load on to cars on any of the Military Railroads of\r\n    the Department of the Rappahannock any freights which are not\r\n    strictly and properly included in Quarter and Commissary stores.\r\n    They shall not load or permit to be loaded any articles for the\r\n    private use of officers, or other persons, whatever their rank\r\n    or position.\r\n\r\nOfficers, again, there were who, regardless of all traffic\r\nconsiderations, would order a train to pull up at any point they thought\r\nfit along the main line in order that they could examine the passes and\r\npermits of the passengers, instead of doing this at a terminal or other\r\nstation. In still another instance a paymaster adopted as his office a\r\nbox car standing on a main line. He placed in it a table, some chairs, a\r\nmoney-chest and his papers--finding it either more comfortable or more\r\nconvenient than a house alongside--and proceeded with the transaction\r\nof all his Army business in the car. Invited to withdraw, on the\r\nground that he was holding up the traffic, he refused to leave, and\r\nhe persisted in his refusal until troops were called up to remove his\r\nthings for him.\r\n\r\nDefective arrangements in regard to the forwarding of supplies were\r\nanother cause of traffic disorganisation. The railwayman made from time\r\nto time the most strenuous efforts in getting to the extreme front large\r\nconsignments of articles either in excess of requirements or not wanted\r\nthere at all. After blocking the line for some days, the still-loaded\r\ncars might be sent back again, no fewer than 142 of such cars being\r\nreturned on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad in the course of a single\r\nday. If the excessive supplies so sent were unloaded at the front, they\r\nmight have to be loaded into the cars again when the Army moved; or, as\r\nwas frequently the case in exposed positions, they might be seized or\r\ndestroyed by the enemy. Under a well-organised system an adequate stock\r\nof supplies would, of course, have been kept in stores or on sidings at\r\nsome point in the rear, only such quantities being forwarded to the\r\nadvanced front as were really needed.\r\n\r\nAt the railway stations there were frequent disputes between the\r\nresponsible officers as to which should have the first use of such\r\ntroop trains as were available, and Haupt found it necessary to ask the\r\nCommander-in-Chief to delegate some one who would decide in what order\r\nthe troops should be forwarded.\r\n\r\nMuch trouble arose because, in their anxiety to send off as many wounded\r\nas they could, medical officers detained their trains for such periods\r\nas dislocated the service, instead of despatching at schedule time the\r\nmen they had ready, and then asking for an extra train for the remainder.\r\n\r\nIn other respects, also, the arrangements for the transport of the\r\nsick and wounded were defective. Telegraphing on this subject to the\r\nAssistant Secretary of War on August 22, 1862, Haupt said:--\r\n\r\n    I fear that I may be compelled to-night to do what may\r\n    appear inhuman--turn out the sick in the street. Doctors will\r\n    persist in sending sick, often without papers, to get them\r\n    off their hands, and we cannot send forward the troops if we\r\n    must run our trains to Washington with sick to stand for hours\r\n    unloaded. My first care is to send forward troops, next forage\r\n    and subsistence.\r\n\r\nStill more serious were the irregularities due to delays in the\r\nunloading of trucks and the return of empties. The amount of rolling\r\nstock available was already inadequate to meet requirements; but the\r\neffect of the shortage was rendered still worse by reason of these\r\ndelays, due, in part, to the too frequent insufficiency of the force\r\navailable for unloading a train of supplies with the expedition that\r\nshould have been shown, and in part to the retention of the cars for\r\nweeks together as storehouses; though the main cause, perhaps, was\r\nthe inability of military men, inexperienced in railway working, to\r\nappreciate, as railwaymen would do, the need of getting the greatest\r\npossible use out of rolling stock in times of emergency, and not\r\nallowing it to stand idle longer than absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nHow such delays interfered with the efficiency of the railways was\r\nindicated in one of Haupt's oft-repeated protests, in which he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    If all cars on their arrival at a depôt are immediately\r\n    loaded or unloaded and returned, and trains are run to schedule,\r\n    a single-track road, in good order and properly equipped, may\r\n    supply an army of 200,000 men when, if these conditions are not\r\n    complied with, the same road will not supply 30,000.\r\n\r\nOn July 9, 1863, he telegraphed to General M. C. Meigs:--\r\n\r\n    I am on my way to Gettysburg again. Find things in great\r\n    confusion. Road blocked; cars not unloaded; stores ordered\r\n    to Gettysburg--where they stand for a long time, completely\r\n    preventing all movement there--ordered back without unloading;\r\n    wounded lying for hours without ability to carry them off. All\r\n    because the simple rule of promptly unloading and returning cars\r\n    is violated.\r\n\r\nAs for the effect of all these conditions on the military situation as\r\na whole, this is well shown in the following \"Notice,\" which, replying\r\nto complaints that railwaymen had not treated the military officers with\r\nproper respect, Haupt addressed \"To agents and other employés of the\r\nUnited States Military Railroad Department\":--\r\n\r\n    While conscious of no disposition to shield the employés or\r\n    agents of the Military Railroads from any censure or punishment\r\n    that is really merited, justice to them requires me to state\r\n    that, so far, examination has shown that complaints against them\r\n    have been generally without proper foundation, and, when demands\r\n    were not promptly complied with, the cause has been inability,\r\n    arising from want of proper notice, and not indisposition.\r\n\r\n    Officers at posts entrusted with the performance of certain\r\n    local duties, and anxious, as they generally are, to discharge\r\n    them efficiently, are not always able, or disposed, to look\r\n    beyond their own particular spheres. They expect demands on\r\n    railway agents to be promptly complied with, without considering\r\n    that similar demands, at the same time, in addition to the\r\n    regular train service and routine duties, may come from\r\n    Quartermasters, Commissaries, medical directors, surgeons,\r\n    ordnance officers, the Commanding General, the War Department\r\n    and from other sources. The Military Railroads have utterly\r\n    failed to furnish transportation to even one-fifth of their\r\n    capacity when managed without a strict conformity to schedule\r\n    and established rules. Punctuality and discipline are even more\r\n    important to the operation of a railroad than to the movement of\r\n    an army; and they are vital in both.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if even the Confederate raiders and wreckers had, by\r\ntheir destructive tactics, diminished the efficiency of the Union\r\nrailways to the extent of the four-fifths here attributed to the\r\nirregularities and shortcomings of the Federals themselves. The clearest\r\nproof was thus afforded that, if the new arm in warfare which rail-power\r\nrepresented was to accomplish all it was capable of doing, it would have\r\nto be saved from friends quite as much as from foes.\r\n\r\nHaupt, as we have seen, suffered much from officers during the time\r\nhe was connected with the Military Railroads in Virginia. He had the\r\nsympathetic support of the Commander-in-Chief, who telegraphed to him\r\non one occasion (August 23, 1862), \"No military officer will give any\r\norders to your subordinates except through you, nor will any of them\r\nattempt to interfere with the running of trains\"; and, also, of the\r\nAssistant Secretary of War, who sought to soothe him in a message which\r\nsaid:--\"Be patient as possible with the Generals. Some of them will\r\ntrouble you more than they will the enemy.\" But the abuses which arose\r\nwere so serious that, in the interest of the military position itself,\r\nthey called for a drastic remedy; and this was provided for by the issue\r\nof the following Order:--\r\n\r\n    War Department,\r\n    Adjutant-General's Office,\r\n    Washington,\r\n    _November 10, 1862_.\r\n\r\n    SPECIAL ORDER.\r\n\r\n    Commanding officers of troops along the United States\r\n    Military Railroads will give all facilities to the officers\r\n    of the road and the Quartermasters for loading and unloading\r\n    cars so as to prevent any delay. On arrival at depôts, whether\r\n    in the day or night, the cars will be instantly unloaded, and\r\n    working parties will always be in readiness for that duty, and\r\n    sufficient to unload the whole train at once.\r\n\r\n    Commanding officers will be charged with guarding the track,\r\n    sidings, wood, water tanks, etc., within their several commands,\r\n    and will be held responsible for the result.\r\n\r\n    Any military officer who shall neglect his duty in this\r\n    respect will be reported by the Quartermasters and\r\n    officers of the railroad, and his name will be stricken from the\r\n    rolls of the Army.\r\n\r\n    Depôts will be established at suitable points under the\r\n    direction of the Commanding General of the Army of the Potomac,\r\n    and properly guarded.\r\n\r\n    No officer, whatever may be his rank, will interfere with\r\n    the running of the cars, as directed by the superintendent of\r\n    the road. Any one who so interferes will be dismissed from the\r\n    service for disobedience of orders.\r\n\r\n    By order of the Secretary of War.\r\n    J. C. KELTON.\r\n\r\nCommenting on this Order, General McCallum says in his report that\r\nit was issued \"in consequence of several attempts having been made\r\nto operate railroads by Army or departmental commanders which had,\r\nwithout exception, proved signal failures, disorganising in tendency and\r\ndestructive of all discipline\"; and he proceeds:--\r\n\r\n    Having had a somewhat extensive railroad experience, both\r\n    before and since the rebellion, I consider this Order of the\r\n    Secretary of War to have been the very foundation of success;\r\n    without it the whole railroad system, which had proved an\r\n    important element in conducting military movements, would have\r\n    been, not only a costly but ludicrous failure. The fact should\r\n    be understood that the management of railroads is just as much a\r\n    distinct profession as is that of the art of war, and should be\r\n    so regarded.\r\n\r\nIn _Europe_, Germany and Austria-Hungary were the first countries to\r\nattempt to solve problems that seemed to go to the very foundations of\r\nthe practical usefulness of rail-transport in war. Various exhaustive\r\nstudies thereon were written by railway or military authorities, and\r\nit may be of interest here to refer, more especially, to the views\r\nexpressed by an eminent German authority, Baron M. M. von Weber, in \"Die\r\nSchulung der Eisenbahnen,\" published in 1870.[7]\r\n\r\nRailway irregularities peculiar to war service were stated by this\r\nwriter to be mainly of three kinds:--(i) Delays from unsatisfactory\r\narrangements of the service and from the misemployment of rolling\r\nstock; (ii) temporary interruption of traffic owing to the crowding of\r\ntransport masses at the stations or sidings; (iii) unsuitableness of the\r\nstations and conveyances for the required military services. The special\r\nreasons for the first of these causes he defined as (_a_) the absence\r\nof sufficient mutual comprehension between the military and the railway\r\nofficials; (_b_) the strict limitation of the efficiency of individual\r\nrailway authorities to their own lines only; (_c_) the ignorance of\r\nthe entire staff of each line with regard to the details and service\r\nregulations of the neighbouring lines; and (_d_) the impracticability\r\nof employing certain modes of carrying on business beyond the circuit\r\nto which they belong. It should, however, be borne in mind that these\r\ncriticisms of authorities and their staffs relate to the conditions of\r\nthe German railway system in 1870, at which time, as told by H. Budde,\r\nin \"Die französischen Eisenbahnen im Kriege 1870-71,\" there were in\r\nGermany fifteen separate Directions for State railways; five Directions\r\nof private railways operated by the State; and thirty-one Directions of\r\nprivate railways operated by companies--a total of fifty-one controlling\r\nbodies which, on an average, operated only 210 miles of line each.\r\n\r\nOn the general question von Weber observed:--\r\n\r\n    The value in practice of mutual intelligence between\r\n    military and railway officials has hitherto been far too\r\n    slightly regarded.\r\n\r\n    Demands for services from military authorities,\r\n    impracticable from the very nature of railways in general or\r\n    the nature of the existing lines in particular, have occasioned\r\n    confusion and ill-will on the part of the railway authorities\r\n    and conductors. On the other hand the latter have frequently\r\n    declared services to be impracticable which were really not so.\r\n\r\n    All this has arisen because the two parties in the\r\n    transaction have too little insight into the nature and\r\n    mechanism of their respective callings, and regard their powers\r\n    more as contradictory than co-operative, so that they do not,\r\n    and cannot, work together.\r\n\r\n    If, on the contrary, the nature of the railway service,\r\n    with its modifications due to differences in the nature of\r\n    the ground, the locality, and the organisation of transport\r\n    requirements, is apparent to the military officer, even in a\r\n    general way; if he appreciates the fact that the same amount of\r\n    transport must be differently performed when he passes from a\r\n    level line to a mountain line, from a double line to a single\r\n    line, from one where the signal and telegraph system are in use\r\n    to one in which these organs of safety and intelligence are\r\n    destroyed; if he can judge of the capability of stations, the\r\n    length of track, and arrangements for the loading, ordering\r\n    and passing of trains, etc., he will, with this knowledge,\r\n    and his orders being framed in accordance with it, come much\r\n    sooner and with greater facility to an understanding with the\r\n    railway executives than if his commands had to be rectified by\r\n    contradiction and assertion, frequently carried on under the\r\n    influence of excited passions, or attempted to be enforced by\r\n    violence.\r\n\r\n    The railway official, also, who has some acquaintance with\r\n    military science, who understands from practical experience and\r\n    inspection, not confined to his own line, the capabilities of\r\n    lines and stations in a military point of view, will, at his\r\n    first transaction with the military authorities, enter sooner\r\n    into an understanding with them than if he were deficient\r\n    in this knowledge, and will find himself in a position to\r\n    co-operate, and not be coerced.\r\n\r\nHere the suggestion seems to be that the individual Army officer and the\r\nindividual railway executive, or railway official, should each become\r\nsufficiently acquainted with the technicalities of the other's business\r\nto be able to conduct their relations with mutual understanding. It\r\nwould, however, be too much to expect that this plan could be carried\r\nout as regards either the military element in general or the railway\r\nelement in general.\r\n\r\nThe real need of the situation was, rather, for some intermediary\r\norganisation which, including both elements, would provide the machinery\r\nfor close co-operation between the Army on the one side and the railway\r\non the other, guiding the Army as to the possibilities and limitations\r\nof the railway, and constituting the recognised and sole medium\r\nthrough which orders from the Army would be conveyed to the railway,\r\nno individual commander or officer having the right to give any direct\r\norder to the railway executives or staffs on his own responsibility, or\r\nto interfere in any way with the working of the railways, except in some\r\nsuch case of extreme emergency as an attack by the enemy on a railway\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nAll these problems were to form the subject of much more controversy,\r\ntogether with much further practical experience, in various other\r\ncountries--and notably in France during the war of 1870-71--before,\r\nas will be told in due course, they were solved by the adoption of\r\nelaborate systems of organisation designed to provide, as far as\r\npossible, for all contingencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[7] See Bibliography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPROTECTION OF RAILWAYS IN WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe liability of railway lines to interruption or destruction--whether\r\nby bodies of cavalry sent across the frontier for that purpose, and\r\naiming at damage on a large scale; by smaller raiding parties operating\r\nin the rear of an advancing army; or by individuals acting on their own\r\naccount in a hostile country--rendered necessary from an early date\r\nin the railway era the adoption of protective measures of a type and\r\ncharacter varying according to circumstances; while these, in turn,\r\nintroduced some further new features into modern warfare.\r\n\r\nUnder the orders given by General McDowell for the guarding of railways\r\nin the Department of the Rappahannock, in the _American Civil War_,\r\ntwelve sentinels were posted along each mile of track; block-houses were\r\nconstructed at each bridge, at cross-roads, and at intervals along the\r\ntrack; pickets were thrown forward at various points; bushes and trees\r\nwere cleared away from alongside the line, and the men at each post had\r\nflags and lanterns for signalling. General Sherman took similar measures\r\nto guard his rail communications between Nashville and Atlanta.\r\n\r\nPrecautions such as these were directed mainly against the enemy in the\r\nfield; but an early example was to be afforded of how a civil population\r\nmay either concern themselves or be concerned against their will in the\r\nmaintenance of rail communication for military purposes. This position\r\nis well shown in the following proclamation, issued July 30, 1863, by\r\nMajor-General G. G. Meade from the head-quarters of the Army of the\r\nPotomac at a time when attempts to throw troop trains off the railway\r\nlines were a matter of daily occurrence:--\r\n\r\n    The numerous depredations committed by citizens or rebel\r\n    soldiers in disguise, harboured and concealed by citizens, along\r\n    the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, and within our lines, call\r\n    for prompt and exemplary punishment. Under the instructions of\r\n    the Government, therefore, every citizen against whom there is\r\n    sufficient evidence of his having engaged in these practices\r\n    will be arrested and confined for punishment, or put beyond the\r\n    lines.\r\n\r\n    The people within ten miles of the railroad are notified\r\n    that they will be held responsible, in their persons and\r\n    property, for any injury done to the road, trains, depôts or\r\n    stations by citizens, guerillas or persons in disguise; and\r\n    in case of such injury they will be impressed as labourers to\r\n    repair all damages.\r\n\r\n    If these measures should not stop such depredations, it will\r\n    become the unpleasant duty of the undersigned, in the execution\r\n    of his instructions, to direct that the entire inhabitants of\r\n    the district of country along the railroad be put across the\r\n    lines, and their property taken for Government uses.\r\n\r\nOn the Manassas Gap Railway General Auger further sought to protect\r\nFederal army trains against guerilla attacks by placing in a conspicuous\r\nposition in each of such trains some of the leading Confederates\r\nresiding within Union lines, so that, should any accident happen to the\r\ntrain, they would run the risk of being among the victims.\r\n\r\nIn the _Austro-Prussian War of 1866_ the principle of punishing\r\nthe civil population for attacks on the railway lines underwent a\r\nfurther development. Captain Webber says in reference to the line\r\nthrough Turnau, Prague and Pardubitz to Brünn[8]: \"The Prussians\r\nwere fortunate in being able to preserve the line intact from injury\r\nby the inhabitants, partly by the number and strength of the guards\r\nposted along it, and partly from the terror of reprisals which they\r\nhad inspired.\" Captain Webber suggests that, in the face of an active\r\nenemy, and in a country where the population was hostile, it would\r\nhave been impossible to depend on the railway as a principal line of\r\ncommunication; but the significance of his expression, \"the terror of\r\nreprisals,\" as denoting the policy adopted by Prussia so far back as\r\n1866, will not be lost on those who are only too well acquainted with\r\nmore recent developments of the same policy by the same country.\r\n\r\nThe number of men per mile required for guarding a line of rail\r\ncommunication is declared by Captain John Bigelow, in his \"Principles of\r\nStrategy\" (Philadelphia, 1894), to be exceedingly variable, depending\r\nas it does upon the tactical features of the country and the temper of\r\nthe inhabitants. According, he says, to the estimate of the Germans for\r\nthe conditions of European warfare, the number will average about 1,000\r\nmen for every stretch of fifteen miles. At this rate an army sixty miles\r\nfrom its base requires about 4,000 men for the protection of each line\r\nof communication.\r\n\r\nWith the help of figures such as these one may, perhaps, understand\r\nthe more readily how it is that a Commander-in-Chief, of merciless\r\ndisposition, and wanting to retain the active services of every soldier\r\nhe possibly can in the interests of an early and successful advance\r\nwill, by spreading a feeling of \"terror\" among the civil population,\r\nseek to reduce to as low a figure as circumstances will permit\r\nthe number of men he must leave behind to guard his lines of rail\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nThese considerations will be found to apply with the greater force\r\nwhen it is remembered that in the _Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71_ the\r\nPrussians had to adopt an especially elaborate system for safeguarding\r\ntheir lines of communication with Germany during the time they occupied\r\nFrench territory. At each railway station they placed a guard formed of\r\ndetachments of the Landwehr, while small detachments were stationed in\r\ntowns and villages in the neighbourhood. In each signal-box a detachment\r\nof troops was stationed, and the whole line of railway was patrolled\r\nfrom posts established along it at distances of every three or four\r\nmiles. Altogether, the Germans are said to have employed, on over 2,000\r\nmiles of French railway lines controlled by them, as many as 100,000\r\ntroops for protective purposes only; and even then the _franc-tireurs_\r\nwere able to cause many interruptions.\r\n\r\nUnder a Prussian regulation dated May 2, 1867, it was laid down that\r\nafter the restoration of any lines taken possession of in an enemy's\r\nterritory, notice should be given that in the event of any further\r\ndamage being done to the railway, the locality would be subject to a\r\nfine of at least 500 thalers, the belongings of the inhabitants would be\r\nliable to seizure, and the local authorities might be arrested.\r\n\r\nAs a further precautionary measure in the war of 1870-71, the Germans\r\ntook a hint from the example of the Union Generals in the American Civil\r\nWar by compelling a leading citizen of the district passed through to\r\nride on the engine of each train run by them on French soil. In defence\r\nof this practice, the German General Staff say in their handbook on \"The\r\nUsages of War\"[9]:--\r\n\r\n    Since the lives of peaceable inhabitants were, without any\r\n    fault on their part, thereby exposed to grave danger, every\r\n    writer outside Germany has stigmatised this measure as contrary\r\n    to the law of nations and as unjustified towards the inhabitants\r\n    of the country. As against this unfavourable criticism it must\r\n    be pointed out that this measure, which was also recognised on\r\n    the German side as harsh and cruel, was only resorted to after\r\n    declarations and instructions of the occupying authorities had\r\n    proved ineffective, and that in the particular circumstances\r\n    it was the only method which promised to be effective against\r\n    the doubtless unauthorised, indeed the criminal, behaviour of\r\n    a fanatical population. Herein lies its justification under\r\n    the laws of war, but still more in the fact that it proved\r\n    completely successful, and that wherever citizens were thus\r\n    carried on the trains ... the security of traffic was assured.\r\n\r\nWriting under date December 16, 1870, Busch offered the following\r\njustification for the course adopted:--\r\n\r\n    They were taken, not to serve as a hindrance to French\r\n    heroism, but as a precaution against treacherous crime. The\r\n    railway does not carry merely soldiers, ammunition and other\r\n    war material against which it may be allowable to use violent\r\n    measures; it also conveys a great number of wounded, doctors,\r\n    hospital attendants, and other perfectly harmless persons. Is a\r\n    peasant or _franc-tireur_ to be allowed to endanger hundreds of\r\n    those lives by removing a rail or laying a stone upon the line?\r\n    Let the French see that the security of the railway trains is no\r\n    longer threatened and the journeys made by those hostages will\r\n    be merely outings, or our people may even be able to forgo such\r\n    precautionary measures.\r\n\r\nIn the _South African War_, Field-Marshal Earl Roberts issued at\r\nPretoria, on June 19, 1900, a proclamation one section of which\r\nauthorised the placing of leading men among the Boers on the locomotives\r\nof the trains run by the British on the occupied territory; but this\r\nparticular section was withdrawn eight days afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe English view of the practice in question is thus defined in the\r\nofficial \"Manual of Military Law\" (Chap. XIV, \"The Laws and Usages of\r\nWar,\" par. 463):--\r\n\r\n    Such measures expose the lives of inhabitants, not only\r\n    to the illegitimate acts of train wrecking by private enemy\r\n    individuals, but also to the lawful operations of raiding\r\n    parties of the armed forces of the belligerent, and cannot,\r\n    therefore, be considered a commendable practice.\r\n\r\nTo guard against the attacks made on the railway lines in the Orange\r\nFree State and the Transvaal during the British occupation, entrenched\r\nposts were placed at every bridge exceeding a 30-feet span; constant\r\npatrolling was maintained between these posts; and the block-houses\r\nintroduced (in 1901) by Lord Kitchener were erected along all the\r\nrailway lines, at distances of about 2,000 yards. Each block-house,\r\nalso, was garrisoned by about ten men, and each was surrounded by wire\r\nentanglements which, together with various kinds of alarm fences, were\r\nalso placed between the block-houses themselves in order both to impede\r\nthe approach of the enemy and to warn the garrison thereof.\r\n\r\n_Block-houses_ are to-day regarded as one of the chief means of\r\nprotecting railways against attacks. Their construction and equipment\r\nare dealt with by Major W. D. Connor, of the Corps of Engineers, U.S.A.,\r\nin \"Military Railways\" (Professional Papers, No. 32, Corps of Engineers,\r\nU.S. Army, Washington, 1910).\r\n\r\nSupplementary to the adoption of this block-house system, in time of\r\nwar, is the practice followed in various Continental countries, in\r\ntime of peace, of building _permanent fortresses_, in solid masonry,\r\nalongside railway bridges crossing important rivers. In some instances\r\nthe fortress is so constructed that the railway lines pass through the\r\ncentre of it. Not only, as a rule, are these fortresses extremely solid\r\nand substantial, but they may be provided with bomb-proof covers and\r\nbe stocked with a sufficient supply of provisions to be able to stand,\r\nif necessary, a fairly prolonged siege. One can assume, also, that the\r\ngarrison would have under its control facilities arranged in advance for\r\nthe destruction of the bridge, as a last resort, in case of need.\r\n\r\nThe theory is that such fortresses and their garrisons should be of\r\nespecial advantage, on the outbreak of war, in checking any sudden\r\ninvasion and allowing time for the completion of defensive measures.\r\nTheir construction in connection with all the principal railway bridges\r\ncrossing the Rhine was especially favoured in Prussia after the war of\r\n1870-1.\r\n\r\nSimilar fortresses, or \"interrupting forts,\" as the Germans call them,\r\nare also built for the protection of important tunnels, junctions,\r\nlocomotive and carriage works, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother method adopted for the safeguarding of railway lines in war is\r\nthe use of _armoured trains_; though in practice these are also employed\r\nfor the purposes of independent attacks on the enemy, apart altogether\r\nfrom any question of ensuring the safety of rail communication.[10]\r\n\r\nFor the _protection of locomotives and rolling stock_, and to prevent\r\nnot only their capture but their use by the enemy, the most efficacious\r\nmethod to adopt is, of course, that of removing them to some locality\r\nwhere the enemy is not likely to come.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1866, Austria saw that she could not hold back the Prussian\r\ninvader, she took off into Hungary no fewer than 1,000 locomotives and\r\n16,000 wagons from the railways in Bohemia and Saxony. Similar tactics\r\nwere adopted by the Boers as against ourselves in the war in South\r\nAfrica. On the British troops crossing into the Orange Free State,\r\nfrom Cape Colony, they found that the retreating enemy had withdrawn\r\nall their rolling stock, as well as all their staffs from the railway\r\nstations, leaving behind only a more or less damaged line of railway.\r\nSubsequently, when the forces occupied Pretoria, they certainly did find\r\nthere sixteen locomotives and 400 trucks; but the station books showed\r\nthat in the previous forty-eight hours no fewer than seventy trains,\r\nmany of them drawn by two engines, had been sent east in the direction\r\nof Delagoa Bay.\r\n\r\nWhen it is not practicable to withdraw locomotives and rolling stock\r\nwhich it is desired the enemy shall not be able to use, the obvious\r\nalternative is that measures should be taken either to remove vital\r\nparts or to ensure their destruction. Certain of the methods adopted\r\nduring the Civil War in America were especially efficacious in attaining\r\nthe latter result. In some instances trains were started running and\r\nthen--driver and fireman leaping off the engine--were left to go into\r\na river, or to fall through a broken viaduct. In other instances two\r\ntrains, after having had a good supply of explosives put in them, would\r\nbe allowed to dash into one another at full speed. Many locomotives\r\nhad their boilers burst, and wagons were set on fire after having been\r\nfilled up with combustibles.\r\n\r\nStill another method which has been adopted with a view to preventing\r\nan enemy from using the railways he might succeed in capturing is that\r\nof constructing them with a _different gauge_. The standard gauge of\r\nthe main-line railways in France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Denmark,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Italy, Switzerland, Roumania and Turkey (like that,\r\nalso, of railways in Great Britain, Canada and the United States), is\r\n4ft. 8½in., allowing trains to pass readily from one country to the\r\nother with the same rolling stock; but the gauge of the Russian railways\r\nis 5ft., necessitating a transshipment from one train to another when\r\nthe frontier is reached. Similar conditions are found in Spain and\r\nPortugal, where the standard gauge is 5ft. 6in.[11]\r\n\r\nRussia adopted her broader gauge so that, in case of invasion, the\r\ninvader should not be able to run his rolling-stock over her lines, as\r\nGermany, for instance, would be able to do in the case of the railways\r\nof Belgium and France. Thus far, therefore, Russia strengthened her\r\nposition from the point of view of defence; but she weakened it as\r\nregards attack, since if she should herself want, either to become the\r\ninvader or to send troop trains over neighbouring territory to some\r\npoint beyond, she would be at a disadvantage. In the Russo-Turkish War\r\nof 1877-78, when the Russian forces passed through Roumania on their way\r\nto Turkey, the difference in gauge between the Russian and the Roumanian\r\nrailways caused great delay and inconvenience by reason of the necessary\r\ntransfer of troops, stores, guns, ammunition, torpedo boats, etc., at\r\nthe frontier.\r\n\r\nIt should, also, be remembered that the reduction of a broad gauge to a\r\nnarrow one is a much simpler matter, from an engineering point of view,\r\nthan the widening of a narrower gauge into a broad one. In the former\r\ncase the existing sleepers, bridges, tunnels, platforms, etc., would\r\nstill serve their purpose. In the latter case fresh sleepers might have\r\nto be laid, bridges and tunnels widened or enlarged, and platforms and\r\nstations altered, use of the broader-gauge rolling stock thus involving\r\nan almost complete reconstruction of the railway lines. To this extent,\r\ntherefore, the balance of advantage would seem to be against the country\r\nhaving the broader gauge. The conclusion may, at least, be formed that\r\nsuch a country is far more bent on protecting her own territory than on\r\ninvading that of her neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe course adopted by Germany for overcoming the difficulty which, in\r\nthe event of her seeking to invade Russia, the difference of railway\r\ngauge in that country would present, will be told in Chapter XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] \"Notes on the Campaign in Bohemia in 1866.\" By Capt. Webber, R.E.\r\nPapers of the Corps of Royal Engineers, N.S., vol. xvi. Woolwich, 1868.\r\n\r\n[9] \"The German War Book. Being the Usages of War on Land\"; issued by\r\nthe Great General Staff of the German Army. London, 1915.\r\n\r\n[10] The subject of armoured trains will be dealt with more fully in\r\nChapters VII and XVI.\r\n\r\n[11] See \"Field Service Pocket Book, 1914,\" pp. 151-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTROOPS AND SUPPLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the earlier controversies as to the use of railways in war, attention\r\nwas almost entirely concentrated on questions relating to the movement\r\nof large masses of troops, the saving of time to be effected, and the\r\nstrategic advantages to be gained. These considerations quickly passed\r\nfrom the theoretical to the practical, and when the results attained\r\nwere put against such facts as, for instance, the one that in 1805\r\nNapoleon's Grand Army of 200,000 men took forty-two days to march the\r\n700 kilometres (435 miles) between Ulm on the Danube and the French camp\r\nat Boulogne, there was no longer any possibility of doubt as to the\r\nservices that railways might render from these particular points of view.\r\n\r\n_Quicker transport_ was, however, only one consideration. There was the\r\nfurther important detail that the movement of troops by rail would bring\r\nthem to their point of concentration, not only sooner, but in _more\r\ncomplete numbers_, than if they had to endure the fatigues of prolonged\r\nmarches by road.\r\n\r\nAccording to German authorities, the falling-out of infantry and cavalry\r\nwhen marching along good roads under conditions of well-maintained\r\ndiscipline and adequate food supplies averages three per cent. in cool\r\nand dry weather, and six per cent. in hot or wet weather; while in\r\nunfavourable conditions as regards roads, weather and supplies, the\r\ndiminution may be enormous. When, in the autumn of 1799, Suvóroff made\r\nhis famous march over the St. Gothard, he lost, in eleven days, no\r\nfewer than 10,000 men owing to the hardships of the journey. In his\r\ninvasion of Russia, in 1812, Napoleon's losses in men who succumbed to\r\nthe fatigues and trials they experienced on the road were out of all\r\nproportion to the casualties due to actual fighting. It was, too, a\r\nsaying of Blücher's that \"he feared night marches worse than the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nAn English authority, Lieut.-Col. R. Home, C.B., R.E., wrote in a\r\npaper on \"The Organisation of the Communications, including Railways,\"\r\npublished in Vol XIX. of the Journal of the Royal United Service\r\nInstitution (1875):--\r\n\r\n    If an army of moderate size, say 50,000 men, simply marches\r\n    one hundred miles without firing one shot or seeing an enemy the\r\n    number of sick to be got rid of is very great.\r\n\r\n    Experience has shown that in a good climate, with abundant\r\n    food, easy marches, and fair weather, the waste from ordinary\r\n    causes in a ten days' march of such a force would be between\r\n    2,000 and 2,500 men, while the number of galled, footsore\r\n    or worn-out horses would also be very large. A few wet days\r\n    or a sharp engagement would raise the number of both very\r\n    considerably. An inefficient man or horse at the front is a\r\n    positive disadvantage.\r\n\r\nAnother equally important detail relates to the _provision of supplies_\r\nfor the troops and animals thus transported by rail both more quickly\r\nand with less fatigue.\r\n\r\nIn all ages the feeding of his troops in an enemy's country has been\r\none of the gravest problems a military commander has had to solve;\r\nand though, in some instances, vast armies have succeeded in drawing\r\nsufficient support from the land they have invaded, there have been\r\nothers in which an army intending to \"live upon the country\" has failed\r\nto get the food it needed, and has had its numbers depleted to the\r\nextent of thousands as the result of sheer starvation. This was the\r\nexperience of Darius, King of Persia, who, in 513 B.C., crossed the\r\nBosporus, on a bridge of boats, with an army of 700,000, followed the\r\nretreating Scythians, and lost 80,000 of his men in wild steppes where\r\nno means existed for feeding them. When, also, Alexander the Great was\r\nwithdrawing from India, in 325 B.C., two-thirds of his force died on\r\nthe desert plains of Beluchistan from thirst or hunger. Lack of the\r\nsupplies from which he found himself entirely cut off was, again, a main\r\ncause of the disaster that overtook Napoleon in his Russian campaign.\r\nEven fertile or comparatively fertile lands, satisfying the needs of\r\ntheir inhabitants in time of peace, may fail to afford provisions for\r\nan invading army, either because of the great number of the latter or\r\nbecause the retreating population have destroyed the food supplies\r\nthey could not take with them into the interior whether for their own\r\nsustenance or with a view to starving the invaders.\r\n\r\nShould the invading army succeed in \"living on the country,\" the effect\r\nof leaving the troops to their own resources, in the way of collecting\r\nfood, may still be not only subversive of discipline but of strategic\r\ndisadvantage through their being scattered on marauding expeditions at a\r\ntime when, possibly, it would be preferable to keep them concentrated.\r\n\r\nGeneral Friron, chief of the staff of Marshal Masséna, wrote concerning\r\nNapoleon's campaign in Portugal:--\r\n\r\n    The day the soldier became convinced that, for the future,\r\n    he would have to depend on himself, discipline disappeared\r\n    from the ranks of the army. The officer became powerless in\r\n    the presence of want; he was no longer disposed to reprimand\r\n    the soldier who brought him the nourishment essential to his\r\n    existence, and who shared with him, in brotherly goodwill, a\r\n    prey which may have cost him incalculable dangers and fatigues.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which a combination of physical fatigue and shortness of\r\nsupplies in an inhospitable country may interfere with the efficiency of\r\nan army is well shown by Thiers (\"Histoire du Consulat et de l'Empire\")\r\nin regard to the conditions at the very outset of Napoleon's Russian\r\ncampaign. The French troops arriving on the Niemen--at which point they\r\nwere merely on the frontiers of Russia--were already overcome by the\r\nlong marches they had made. They had no bread, no salt, and no spirits;\r\ntheir craving for food could no longer be satisfied by meat without salt\r\nand meal mixed with water. The horses, too, were out of condition for\r\nwant of proper food. Behind the army a great number of soldiers dropped\r\nout of the ranks and had lost their way, while the few people they met\r\nin a scantily-populated district could speak nothing but Polish, which\r\nthe wearied and famished men were unable to understand. Yet, under the\r\nconditions of former days, it was by troops thus exhausted by marches of\r\nhundreds of miles, done on, possibly, a starvation diet, that battles\r\ninvolving the severest strain on human energy were fought.\r\n\r\nWhen \"living on the country\" is no longer practicable, the only\r\nalternative for an army is, of course, that of sending supplies after it\r\nfor the feeding of the troops; but when, or where, this has had to be\r\ndone by means of ordinary road services, it has involved--together with\r\nthe transport of artillery, ammunition and stores--(1) the employment\r\nof an enormous number of vehicles and animals, greatly complicating\r\nthe movements of the army; and (2) a limitation of the distance within\r\nwhich a campaign can be waged by an army depending entirely on its own\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nThe latter of these conditions was the direct consequence of the former;\r\nand the reason for this was shown by General W. T. Sherman in an article\r\ncontributed by him to the _Century Magazine_ for February, 1888 (pp.\r\n595-6), in the course of which he says:--\r\n\r\n    According to the Duke of Wellington, an army moves upon its\r\n    belly, not upon its legs; and no army dependent on wagons can\r\n    operate more than a hundred miles from its base because the\r\n    teams going and returning consume the contents of their wagons,\r\n    leaving little or nothing for the maintenance of men and animals\r\n    at the front who are fully employed in fighting.\r\n\r\nThere was, again, the risk when food supplies followed the army by road\r\neither of perishables going bad _en route_, owing to the time taken in\r\ntheir transport by wagon, or of their suffering deterioration as the\r\nresult of exposure to weather, the consequence in either case being a\r\ndiminution in the amount of provisions available for feeding the army.\r\n\r\nAll these various conditions have been changed by the railway, the use\r\nof which for the purposes of war has, in regard to the forwarding of\r\nsupplies, introduced innovations which are quite as important as those\r\nrelating to the movement of troops--if, indeed, the former advantages\r\nare not of even greater importance than the latter.\r\n\r\nThanks to the railway, an army can now draw its supplies from the\r\nwhole of the interior of the home country--provided that the lines of\r\ncommunication can be kept open; and, with the help not only of regular\r\nrail services but of stores and magazines _en route_ those supplies can\r\nbe forwarded to railhead in just such quantities as they may be wanted.\r\nUnder these conditions the feeding of an army in the field should\r\nbe assured regardless alike of the possible scanty resources of the\r\ncountry in which it is engaged and of its own distance from the base of\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nARMOURED TRAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the issue of the now defunct London periodical, _Once a Week_, for\r\nAugust 13, 1859, there was published an article on \"English Railway\r\nArtillery: A Cheap Defence against Invasion,\" in which it was said,\r\namong other things:--\r\n\r\n    We have hitherto regarded the rail merely as a vehicle\r\n    of transport, to carry materials which are not to be set in\r\n    work till off the rails. If we look at the rail as part of an\r\n    instrument of warfare, we shall be startled at the enormous\r\n    means we have at hand, instantly available, from mercantile\r\n    purposes, to convert to engines of war.\r\n\r\nThe writer was William Bridges Adams (1797-1872), an authority on\r\nrailways who had grown up with them, had introduced into their operation\r\nmany inventions and improvements (including the fish-joint still used\r\nfor connecting rails), and was the author of various books and papers on\r\nrailways, transport, and other subjects. His new idea, as set forth in\r\nthe article in question, was specially directed to the utilisation of\r\nrailways for defending the shores of Great Britain against an invader;\r\nand in developing this idea he was, also, as far as can be traced, the\r\nfirst to suggest the employment of armoured trains.\r\n\r\nThe immediate reason alike for the writing of the article and for the\r\nmaking of the suggestion was that in 1859 Great Britain appeared to be\r\nfaced by the prospect of invasion by France,--a prospect which, in view\r\nof the then admittedly defective condition of the national defences,\r\nled to the creation of the Volunteer Corps, to the appointment of a\r\nRoyal Commission to inquire into the question of coast defence, and\r\nto suggestions being put forward by many different authorities as to\r\nwhat should be done. Among those suggestions was one by the writer in\r\nquestion for supplementing any system of coast defence that might be\r\nadopted by the mounting of guns on railway trucks protected by armour,\r\nsuch trucks being moved from point to point along the coast railways to\r\nmeet, as far as possible, the needs of the military situation.\r\n\r\nHeavy artillery, wrote Adams, though the most formidable implement of\r\nmodern warfare, had the disadvantage of requiring many horses to draw\r\nit. So the problem arose as to how the horses could be dispensed with.\r\nThis could best be done, he thought, by putting artillery on \"our true\r\nline of defence,--our rails,\" and having it drawn, or propelled, by a\r\nlocomotive. \"Mount,\" he said, \"a gun of twenty tons weight on a railway\r\ntruck, with a circular traversing platform, and capable of throwing\r\na shot or shell weighing one hundred to one and a half a distance of\r\nfive miles. A truck on eight wheels would carry this very easily, and\r\nthere would be no recoil.\" Such a battery would be \"practically a\r\nmoving fortress,\" and, used on the coast railways, which he regarded as\r\nconstituting lines of defence, would be \"the cheapest of all possible\r\nfortresses--absolutely a continuous fortress along the whole coast.\"\r\nCommunication with coast railways at all strategical points should,\r\nhowever, be facilitated by the placing of rails along the ordinary\r\nhighways. After giving some technical details as to the construction\r\nalike of coast railways and road tramways, he proceeded:--\r\n\r\n    With these roads communicating with the railroads, the whole\r\n    railway system becomes applicable to military purposes.\r\n\r\n    The railway system is so especially adapted for defence, and\r\n    so little adapted to invaders, that it should become at once a\r\n    matter of experiment how best to adapt Armstrong or other guns\r\n    to its uses. The process of fitting the engines with shot-proof\r\n    walls to protect the drivers against riflemen would be very\r\n    easy.... Nothing but artillery could damage the engines or\r\n    moving batteries, and artillery could not get near them if it\r\n    were desirable to keep out of the way.\r\n\r\n    One gun transportable would do the work of ten which are\r\n    fixtures in forts, and there would be no men to take prisoners,\r\n    for no forts would be captured.\r\n\r\n    The more this system is thought of the more the conviction\r\n    will grow that it is the simplest mode of rendering the country\r\n    impenetrable to invaders at a comparatively trifling cost.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the scheme here proposed included three separate\r\npropositions--(1) the use of railways, as \"engines of war,\" for coast\r\ndefence; (2) the mounting of Armstrong or other guns on railway trucks\r\nfrom which they could be discharged for the purposes of such defence;\r\nand (3) the providing of the engines with \"shot-proof walls\" for the\r\nprotection of the drivers. A similar protection for the men operating\r\nthe guns on the trucks was not then, apparently, considered necessary;\r\nbut we have here what was clearly the germ of the \"armoured train.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the other suggestions advanced on the same occasion were some for\r\nthe employment of railways in general for strategical purposes, and more\r\nespecially for the defence of London; and here, again, the employment of\r\narmoured trains was advocated.\r\n\r\n\"A Staff Officer,\" writing in _The Times_ of July 16, 1860, declared\r\nthat the most efficacious and the most economical line of defence which\r\nLondon could have would be a circular railway forming a complete cordon\r\naround the Metropolis at a distance of fifteen miles from the centre,\r\nand having for its interior lines of operation the numerous railways\r\nalready existing within that radius. On this circular railway there\r\nshould be \"Armstrong and Whitworth ordnance mounted on large iron-plated\r\ntrucks\" fitted with traversing platforms in the way already recommended\r\nby W. Bridges Adams, the trucks themselves, however, and not only the\r\nlocomotives, being protected by \"shot-proof shields.\" The circular\r\nrailway was to be constructed primarily for strategical purposes; but\r\nduring peace the line would be available for ordinary traffic, and in\r\nthis way it could be made to yield at least some return on the capital\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this letter, Lieut. Arthur Walker, then an officer of the\r\n79th Highlanders and the holder of a staff appointment at the School\r\nof Musketry, Fleetwood, followed up the subject by reading a paper\r\non \"Coast Railways and Railway Artillery\" at a meeting of the Royal\r\nUnited Service Institution on January 30, 1865.[12] On this occasion\r\nhe specially advocated the use of \"moveable batteries\" for coast\r\ndefence in conjunction with railways constructed more or less within\r\na short parallel distance of the entire coast line. Field artillery,\r\nhe recommended, should be mounted on a truck the sides of which would\r\nbe \"encased in a cuirass of sufficient thickness,\" while the engine\r\nand tender would also be \"protected by an iron cuirass, and placed\r\nbetween two cupolas for further protection.\" He considered that \"to\r\nattempt to land in face of such an engine of war as this would be simply\r\nimpossible.\" Moving batteries of this kind would be \"the cheapest of\r\nall possible fortresses.... We have nothing to do but to improvise\r\nwell-adapted gun-carriages for our rails.\" At the same meeting Mr. T.\r\nWright, C.E., gave details of a proposed railway train battery for\r\ncoast, frontier and inland defence which was designed to carry ten,\r\ntwenty or forty guns or mortars.\r\n\r\nAnother early advocate of the use of railways as an actual instrument\r\nof warfare was Colonel E. R. Wethered, who, in 1872, wrote to the War\r\nOffice suggesting that heavy ordnance should be mounted on wheeled\r\ncarriages so constructed that they could be moved along any of the\r\nrailways, from point to point. In this way the three-fold advantage\r\nwould be gained of (1) utilising the railway system for purposes of\r\nnational defence; (2) rendering possible a concentration of artillery\r\nwith overwhelming force at any given spot, and, (3) by the use of these\r\nmoveable carriages for the conveyance of the guns, exposing the men to\r\nless risk.\r\n\r\nColonel Wethered further communicated to _The Times_ of May 25, 1877,\r\na letter on \"Portable Batteries\" in which he declared that if, before\r\nan enemy could effect a landing, we were to provide the means of\r\nconcentrating, with unerring certainty, on any given points of the\r\ncoast, a crushing force of artillery, with guns of heavier calibre than\r\neven the warships of the invader could command, it would be impossible\r\nfor the vessels of an invading force to approach near enough to effect\r\nthe landing of their men. He continued:--\r\n\r\n    My proposal is to take the full advantage which our railway\r\n    system, in connection with our insular position, affords, and\r\n    provide powerful moveable batteries which can be sent fully\r\n    equipped in fighting order direct by railway to any required\r\n    point; and the recent experimental trials of the 81-ton gun\r\n    have proved that the heaviest ordnance can be moved and fought\r\n    on railway metals with considerable advantage.... In connection\r\n    with our present main lines of railway, which probably would\r\n    require strengthening at certain points, I would construct\r\n    branch lines or sidings leading to every strategical point\r\n    of our coast and into every fort, as far as possible, with\r\n    requisite platforms.... These branch lines during peace would,\r\n    doubtless, be of some small commercial value.... I would mount\r\n    as many of our heaviest guns as practicable on railway gun\r\n    carriages so that they could be moved by rail from one face of a\r\n    front to another, and from one place to another.\r\n\r\nHe also recommended that guns thus mounted, fully equipped, and ready\r\nfor use, should be kept at three large central depôts which might be\r\nutilised for the defence of London. At each of them he would station (1)\r\nMilitia and Volunteer Artillery able not only to work the guns but to\r\nconstruct, repair or destroy railway lines, and (2) a locomotive corps\r\nspecially trained in the working of traffic under war conditions.\r\n\r\nBy reading a paper at the Royal United Service Institution on April\r\n24, 1891, on \"The Use of Railways for Coast and Harbour Defence,\"[13]\r\nLieut. E. P. Girouard, R.E. (now Major-General Sir E. Percy C. Girouard,\r\nK.C.M.G.), made what was, at that time, an important contribution to a\r\nsubject on which there was then still much to be learned. Sketching a\r\ndetailed scheme comprising the employment of all the coastal railways\r\nfor the purposes of national defence, he emphasised the value of\r\nBritain's \"enormous railway power\" as the strong point of her defensive\r\nposition, whether regarded from the point of view of (1) railway mileage\r\nopen as compared with the square mile of coastal area to be defended,\r\nor (2) the length of coast line compared with the railway mileage at or\r\nnear that coast line, and, therefore, locally available for its defence.\r\n\"Why,\" he asked, \"should we not turn to account the enormous advantage\r\nwhich our great railway power gives us to concentrate every available\r\ngun at a threatened point in the right and the proper time, which the\r\nproper utilisation of our railways can and will do, thereby practically\r\ndoubling or quadrupling our available gun power?\"\r\n\r\nWhilst the subject had thus been under discussion in the United Kingdom,\r\nAmerica, in her _Civil War of 1861-65_, had set the rest of the world an\r\nexample by actually introducing armoured-protected gun-carrying trucks\r\ninto modern warfare.\r\n\r\nWriting from Washington, under date August 29, 1862, to Colonel Herman\r\nHaupt, then Chief of Construction and Transportation in the Department\r\nof Rappahannock, Mr. P. H. Watson, Assistant-Secretary of War,\r\nsaid:--\"An armour-clad car, bullet proof, and mounting a cannon, has\r\narrived here and will be sent down to Alexandria.\" A later message, on\r\nthe same date added:--\"After you see the bullet-proof car, let me know\r\nwhat you think of it. I think you ought at once to have a locomotive\r\nprotected by armour. Can you have the work done expeditiously and well\r\nat Alexandria, or shall I get it done at Philadelphia or Wilmington?\"\r\nThe car was duly received; but Haupt's comments in respect to it, as\r\nrecorded in his \"Reminiscences,\" show that he was not greatly impressed\r\nby the innovation. \"P. H. Watson, Assistant-Secretary of War, sent me,\"\r\nhe says, \"an armour-clad, bullet-proof car, mounting a cannon. The\r\nkindness was appreciated, but the present was an elephant. I could not\r\nuse it, and, being in the way, it was finally side-tracked on an old\r\nsiding in Alexandria.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem, however, that other armour-clad cars were brought into\r\nactual use during the course of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nIn the _Railway Age Gazette_ (Chicago) for January 22, 1915, Mr.\r\nFrederick Hobart, associated editor of the New York _Engineer and Mining\r\nJournal_, writes, from personal knowledge, of two armoured cars which\r\nwere in use in the Civil War. One of these, formed by heavy timbers\r\nbuilt up on a flat car, was put together in the shops of the Atlantic\r\nand North Carolina Railroad Company at Newberne, N.C., in 1862, about\r\ntwo months after the city had been captured by the Burnside expedition.\r\nThe armour consisted of old rails spiked on the outside of the planking\r\ncomposing the sides and front of the car. Along the sides there were\r\nslits for musketry fire, and at the front end there was a port hole\r\ncovered with a shutter behind which a gun from one of the field\r\nbatteries was mounted. The second car was similarly constructed, but was\r\narmed with a naval howitzer. The cars were run ahead of the engine, and\r\nwere used in reconnoitring along the railroad line west of Newberne. Mr.\r\nHobart adds that he was quite familiar with the cars, having assisted in\r\nthe design and construction of both.\r\n\r\nIn the _Century Magazine_ for September, 1887 (page 774), there is given\r\nan illustration (\"from a photograph\") of an armour-clad car described as\r\n\"the Union Railroad Battery\" which was, apparently, used in connection\r\nwith the springing of the mine in front of Petersburg on July 30, 1864.\r\nThe car is shown to have consisted of a low truck with, at one end, a\r\nsloping armour plate coming down almost to the rails, and having a hole\r\nthrough which the gun placed behind it on the truck could be fired. The\r\nsides of the truck were protected from the top of the sloping armour\r\ndownwards, but the back was open. The car was, of course, designed to be\r\npushed in front of the locomotive.\r\n\r\nMr. L. Lodian, also, contributed to the issue of the American\r\nperiodical, _Railway and Locomotive Engineering_, for May, 1915, a\r\ncommunication, under the title of \"The Origin of Armoured Railroad\r\nCars Unquestionably the Product of the American Civil War,\" in which,\r\nclaiming that \"our own Civil War\" originated those cars, he said:--\r\n\r\n    Attached is a picture of one in use on the old\r\n    Philadelphia-Baltimore Railroad. The illustration appeared in\r\n    Frank Leslie's illustrated periodical on May 18, 1864. No better\r\n    proof could be furnished of the authenticity of the fact that\r\n    such a car was in use at that time.... There appears to be no\r\n    great variation even to-day in armoured car design from the\r\n    initial effort of half a century ago. Pictures are appearing\r\n    in numerous periodicals, at the period of writing, of those in\r\n    use by the European belligerents, and in general appearance\r\n    and outline they are about the same as the original, the chief\r\n    variation in their use being that the war-going locomotive is\r\n    also sheathed in armour, whereas that in use in the sixties was\r\n    entirely unprotected, except in front, and then only by reason\r\n    of the mailclad car being placed in front to do the fighting.\r\n\r\nAs against this suggestion, there is the undoubted fact that in the\r\nAmerican Civil War the plan was adopted of having the locomotives\r\nof ordinary troop or supply trains protected by armour-plating as a\r\nprecaution against attack when there was no armoured car in front of\r\nthem. Writing to the Director of Military Railroads on October 8, 1862,\r\nHaupt said:--\r\n\r\n    I have been thinking over the subject of locomotives. It\r\n    is one which, at the present time, and in view of the future\r\n    requirements of the service, demands especial attention.\r\n    Experience has shown that on engines men are targets for\r\n    the enemy; the cabs where they are usually seated have been\r\n    riddled by bullets, and they have only escaped by lying on the\r\n    footboard. It will be necessary to inspire confidence in our men\r\n    by placing iron cabins (bullet proof) upon all or nearly all our\r\n    engines, and the necessity will increase as we penetrate further\r\n    into the enemy's country.\r\n\r\n    Again, it is desirable that the smaller and more delicate\r\n    portions of the apparatus should be better protected than at\r\n    present, and I would be pleased if you would give to the plans,\r\n    of which I spoke to you recently, a careful consideration. It\r\n    seems to me that they are peculiarly well adapted to military\r\n    service.\r\n\r\nHaupt adds that \"protected locomotives and bullet-proof cabs were soon\r\nafter provided, as recommended\"; and elsewhere in his \"Reminiscences\" he\r\nsays, on the same subject:--\r\n\r\n    The bullet-proof cabs on locomotives were very useful--in\r\n    fact, indispensable. I had a number of them made and put on\r\n    engines, and they afforded protection to engineers and firemen\r\n    against the fire from guerillas from the bushes that lined the\r\n    road.\r\n\r\nIn the _Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71_ guns mounted on four\r\narmour-plated trucks, fitted up in the workshops of the Orléans Company,\r\nunder the supervision of M. Dupuy de Lorme, Engineer-in-Chief for Naval\r\nConstruction, were taken into action on four occasions during the siege\r\nof Paris, namely, at Choisy-le-Roi, for the sortie preceding the one\r\nfrom Champigny; near Brie-sur-Marne, to support the Champigny sortie;\r\nat Le Bourget, for one of the attempts to recapture that position; and\r\nat La Malmaison, to support the Montretout sortie. The wagons were\r\nprotected by a covering which consisted of five plates of wrought\r\niron, each two-fifths of an inch thick, and giving, therefore, a total\r\nthickness of two inches. The two engines used were also protected by\r\narmour-plating. One or two of the wagons were struck by field-gun shells\r\nwithout, however, sustaining further damage than the denting of their\r\nplates. The engines escaped damage altogether. On going into action the\r\narmoured wagons were followed by another bullet-proof engine conveying a\r\nparty of men with tools and materials to repair any interruption of the\r\nlines that might interfere with the return of the trains; but the only\r\ndamage done was so slight that it was remedied in about a quarter of an\r\nhour.[14]\r\n\r\nFurther use was made of armoured trains in the _Egyptian Campaign of\r\n1882_. One that was put together to assist in the defensive works at\r\nAlexandria is declared in the official history of the campaign[15] to\r\nhave \"proved most serviceable.\" Two of the trucks, fitted with iron\r\nplating and sand bags as a protecting cover, carried one Nordenfelt and\r\ntwo Gatling guns. A 9-pr. was also placed on one of the trucks, together\r\nwith a crane by means of which it could be lowered out immediately.\r\nOther trucks, rendered bullet proof by sand bags and boiler-plating,\r\nand carrying a force of 200 bluejackets, with small arms, completed the\r\nfighting force. On July 28, the train took part in a reconnaissance sent\r\nout to ascertain the extent of the damage which had been done to the\r\nrailway lines near Arabi's outpost. Shots were fired at the train by the\r\nenemy, but without effect. The reconnaissance was a complete success\r\ninasmuch as it enabled such repairs to be done to the railway as gave\r\nthe use of a second line between Ramleh and Alexandria.\r\n\r\nSo useful had the train been found that it was now further improved\r\nby adding to it a 40-pr. on a truck protected by an iron mantlet. The\r\nlocomotive was put in the middle of the train and was itself protected\r\nby sand bags and railway iron. Thus strengthened, the train went into\r\naction in the reconnaissance in force carried out from Alexandria\r\non August 5, and \"the most interesting incident of the engagement,\"\r\naccording to the official account, \"was the good service done by the\r\n40-pr. from the armoured train.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of September 13 the train, consisting of five\r\nwagons, and having, on this occasion, one Krupp gun and one Gatling in\r\naddition to the 40-pr., was sent to support the attack on Tel el-Kebir.\r\nIt was followed by another train having 350 yards of permanent-way\r\nmaterials, with all the necessary tools and appliances for the prompt\r\ncarrying out of any repairs that might be necessary. Owing, however, to\r\nthe hazy and uncertain light and to the ever-increasing clouds of smoke\r\nthat hung over the battle-field, it was impossible to fire the 40-pr.\r\n\r\nIn the futile attempt made in 1885 to construct a railway from Suakin\r\nto Berber, in support of the _Nile Expedition of 1884-85_, resort was\r\nhad to an armoured train for the purpose of protecting the line from\r\nthe constant attacks to which it was subjected by the enemy. The train\r\ncarried a 20-pr. B.L., which could be fired only either in prolongation\r\nof the line or at a slight angle from it.\r\n\r\nAt the Camp of Exercise in _Delhi_ in January, 1886, some important\r\nexperiments were carried out with a view to testing the practicability\r\nof firing guns at right angles to an ordinary line of railway, the\r\nresult being to establish the fact that a 40-pr. R.B.L. could be fired\r\nwith perfect safety broadside from (_a_) small empty wagons mounted\r\non four wheels; (_b_) small empty wagons weighted up to four tons;\r\nand (_c_) empty eight-wheel bogies. These experiments were especially\r\nsuccessful when account is taken of the fact that no attempt was made to\r\nreduce in any way the energy of recoil.\r\n\r\nOther experiments, begun in 1885, were successfully conducted during a\r\nsuccession of years both by the French Government and by private firms\r\nin _France_ in the transport and the firing of guns from railway trucks\r\nwith a view to obtaining definite data on the subject, more especially\r\nin relation to firing at right angles to the line.\r\n\r\nIn _Italy_ a distinguished officer raised the question in the Italian\r\nParliament, in 1891, as to whether Sicily should not be defended by\r\nmeans of a coast railway and armoured trains.\r\n\r\nSome experiments carried out at _Newhaven, Sussex_, in 1894, were the\r\nmore interesting because the results attained were due to the combined\r\nefforts of Artillery Volunteers and of the London, Brighton and South\r\nCoast Railway Company.\r\n\r\nUnder the Volunteer mobilization scheme of 1891 there were some 300\r\nmembers of the 1st Sussex Artillery Volunteers to whom no special\r\nduties had been allotted, and there happened to be, at Shoreham, a\r\n40-pr. Armstrong B.L. gun which was then serving no particular purpose.\r\nInspired by these two facts, the Secretary of the Committee for National\r\nDefence suggested, in November, 1891, that negotiations should be opened\r\nwith the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company with a view\r\nto their mounting the 40-pr. on a specially prepared truck, designed\r\nto form part of an armoured train, experiments in firing the gun from\r\nthe truck--in order to test the efficiency of this expedient for the\r\npurposes of coast defence--being afterwards carried out by the Artillery\r\nVolunteers whose services were available for the purpose.\r\n\r\nOn being approached, the directors of the railway company readily\r\nconsented to the fitting up of the truck being carried out at their\r\nengineering and carriage works; they contributed towards the expenses,\r\nand members of their staff entered with great cordiality into the\r\nscheme, Mr. R. J. Billington, the locomotive superintendent, being the\r\nfirst to suggest the mounting of the gun on a turntable to be fixed on\r\nthe truck,--a \"bold departure,\" as it was regarded at the time, and one\r\nexpected to produce excellent results. The railway staff were the more\r\ninterested, also, in the proposed experiments because a large proportion\r\nof the members of the 1st Sussex Artillery Volunteers consisted of men\r\nemployed at the Brighton Company's works.\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon these facts, Col. Charles Gervaise Boxall, the\r\ncommanding officer, said in a paper on \"The Armoured Train for Coast\r\nDefence,\" read by him at a meeting of officers and N.C.O.'s of the\r\nBrigade, held at Newhaven Fort, Sussex, on May 14, 1894:--\r\n\r\n    When one considers that a railway company is neither\r\n    a philanthropic institution nor a patriotic society, the\r\n    generous support given to this experiment by so powerful a\r\n    body as the directors of the London, Brighton and South Coast\r\n    Railway Company is in itself some considerable evidence of\r\n    the importance they themselves ascribe to this effort in the\r\n    direction of the maintenance of coast defence and protection\r\n    from invasion.\r\n\r\nPreliminary experiments with the gun were conducted on May 5, 1894,\r\nand they conclusively showed, Col. Boxall said, \"that the gun will\r\nrequire no traversing to correct variation caused by the recoil, while\r\nthe muzzle of the gun can be directed to any part of its circumference\r\nby handspike traversing within half a minute.\" He was evidently proud\r\nof the results even of these preliminary trials. They were the first\r\noccasion on which a heavy gun had been fired broadside on the permanent\r\nway of an English railway, and the truck was the first armour-plated one\r\non which a turntable, a recoil cylinder, and other inventions introduced\r\nhad been employed. So, he further declared:--\r\n\r\n    We do confidently submit that, having proved that such a\r\n    gun as this can be mounted so as to be transportable to any\r\n    part of our railway system at a moment's notice, brought into\r\n    action, and fired with accuracy either end on, broadside, or in\r\n    any other direction, without danger of capsizing, and without\r\n    injury to the permanent way, we have become pioneers of a new\r\n    departure in artillery which must lead to results of the highest\r\n    importance.\r\n\r\nThis was written prior to the full trials, which took place at Newhaven\r\non May 19, 1894, in the presence of a distinguished company of military\r\nmen and others. An account of the event will be found in _The Times_\r\nof May 21, 1894. The gun and its carriage are described as standing on\r\na turntable platform pivoted on the centre of the truck, and revolving\r\non a central \"racer.\" The gun detachments were protected by a plating\r\nsix feet high round three sides of the turntable, and the gun was fired\r\nthrough an aperture in the plating. Drawn by an ordinary locomotive,\r\nthe truck on which the gun was mounted was accompanied by two carriages\r\nconveying the Volunteer Artillerymen who were to serve the gun. Several\r\nrounds were fired at a target some 2,500 yards distant, and \"the\r\narmoured train passed through the searching and severe ordeal most\r\nsuccessfully, the jar caused being so slight that a stone placed on the\r\nrails remained unmoved by the firing.\" The truck, it is further stated,\r\nhad been provided with some cross girders which could be run out and\r\nsupported on blocks in order to secure a broad base when the gun was\r\nfired at right angles to the line, and there was a further arrangement\r\nfor connecting the truck to the rails by strong clips; but the truck\r\nremained sufficiently steady without any need for making use of these\r\nappliances.\r\n\r\nFinally, as will be told more fully in Chapter XVI, the _South African\r\nCampaign of 1899-1902_ definitely established the usefulness of armoured\r\ntrains as an \"instrument of war,\" and led both to the creation of an\r\nefficient organisation for their employment on the most scientific and\r\nmost practical lines and to the establishment of certain principles\r\nin regard to such important matters of detail as uses and purposes,\r\nadministration, staff, armament, tactics, etc. Published in the\r\n\"Detailed History of the Railways in the South African War\" which was\r\nissued by the Royal Engineers' Institute, Chatham, in 1905, these\r\nprinciples were adopted in the _United States_ with modifications to\r\nsuit American conditions, and, so modified, are reproduced in Major\r\nWilliam D. Connor's handbook on \"Military Railways,\" forming No. 32\r\nof the Professional Papers of the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army. An\r\nexcellent treatment of the subject, from a technical point of view,\r\nwill be found in a paper, by Capt. H. O. Nance, on \"Armoured Trains,\"\r\npublished, with photographs and drawings, in \"Papers of the Corps of\r\nRoyal Engineers,\" Fourth Series, Vol. I., Paper 4 (Chatham, 1906).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] _See_ the \"Journal of the Royal United Service Institution\" Vol.\r\nIX., pp. 221-31, 1865.\r\n\r\n[13] \"Journal of the Royal United Service Institution,\" Vol. XXXV., 1891.\r\n\r\n[14] For detailed description, with diagrams, of the trains here in\r\nquestion, _see_ \"Armour-plated Railway Wagons used during the late\r\nSieges of Paris,\" by Lieut.

Revised edition.

In the\r\nItalian campaign of 1859 the French lost 5,498 men, of whom 2,500 died\r\nfrom sickness. On the conclusion of the Russo-Turkish War the Russians\r\nhad 51,000 of their troops sick, the ravages of typhus having been\r\nespecially severe.\r\n\r\nThese conditions have been materially aggravated by the gathering\r\ntogether of great numbers of sick and wounded into overcrowded hospitals\r\nsituate on or near to the theatre of war and destined inevitably to\r\nbecome hot-beds of disease and pestilence far more dangerous to human\r\nlife, under these conditions, than even the most deadly weapons which\r\nthe art of war had invented for use on the battle-field itself.\r\n\r\nNor was it the armies alone that suffered. Returning troops spread the\r\nseeds of disease among the civil population, causing epidemics that\r\nlingered, in some instances, for several years and carried off many\r\nthousands of non-combatants, in addition to the great number of victims\r\namong the combatants themselves. In a volume of 866 pages, published by\r\nDr. E. Gurlt, under the title of \"Zur Geschichte der Internationellen\r\nund Freiwilligen Krankenpflege im Kriege\" (Leipzig, 1873), will be found\r\nmany terrible details concerning the ravages in France, Germany and\r\nAustria of the typhus which Napoleon's troops brought back with them on\r\nthe occasion of their disastrous retreat from Russia.\r\n\r\nThe most practicable means of mitigating, if not of avoiding, these\r\nvarious evils is to be found in the prompt removal of the sick and\r\nwounded from the theatre of war, and their distribution in smaller\r\nunits, not simply among a group of neighbouring towns, but over an\r\narea extending to considerable distances inland. The adoption of this\r\nremedy only became possible, however, with a provision of adequate rail\r\nfacilities, and even then many years were to elapse before an efficient\r\nsystem of railway ambulance transport was finally evolved.\r\n\r\nThe objects which the use of the railway in these directions was to\r\nattain were alike humanitarian and strategical.\r\n\r\nTo the sick and wounded among the troops, prompt removal and widespread\r\ndistribution among hospitals in the interior meant (1) that they avoided\r\nthe risks to which they would have been subjected in the aforesaid\r\novercrowded and pestilential hospitals near the fighting line, where\r\nslight injuries might readily develop dangerous symptoms, and contagious\r\ndisease complete the conditions leading to a fatal issue; (2) that,\r\napart from these considerations, it would be possible to give them a\r\ngreater degree of individual attention if they were distributed among a\r\nlarge number of hospitals away from the scene of the fighting; (3) that\r\nmore conservative methods of surgery became practicable when operations\r\nof a kind not to be attempted either on the battle-field or in temporary\r\nhospitals (from which the inmates might have to be suddenly removed,\r\nowing to some change in the strategical position) could be delayed until\r\nthe sufferer's arrival at some hospital in the interior, where better\r\nappliances and better facilities would be available, and where, after\r\nthe operation, the patient would be able to remain undisturbed until\r\nhe was cured; (4) that these improved conditions might more especially\r\npermit of the avoidance of amputations otherwise imperatively necessary;\r\nand (5) that, on the whole, the wounded soldier was afforded a better\r\nchance of effecting a speedy recovery and of saving both life and limb\r\nthan would be possible if railways were not available.\r\n\r\nTo the army in the field the innovation meant that with the speedy\r\nremoval of the sick and wounded it would be relieved of the great\r\nsource of embarrassment caused by the presence and dependence upon it\r\nof so many inefficients;[16] depôt and intermediate hospitals could\r\nbe reduced to the smallest proportions, and would thus occasion less\r\ninconvenience if, owing to a retreat or a change in the strategical\r\nposition, they were brought within the sphere of military operations;\r\nwith the delegation of so many of the sick and wounded to the care of\r\ncivil practitioners in the interior, fewer of the divisional, brigade\r\nand regimental medical officers would require to be detached from the\r\nmarching column; a smaller supplementary medical staff would suffice;\r\na considerable reduction could be effected in the stocks of ambulance\r\nsupplies kept on hand at the front; while important strategical\r\nadvantages would be gained through (1) the greater freedom of movement\r\nwhich the army would secure; (2) the decreased risk of the number of\r\nefficients being reduced through the outbreak of epidemics; and (3) the\r\nprospect of a large proportion of the sick and wounded being enabled to\r\nrejoin the fighting force on their making a speedy recovery from their\r\nillness or their wounds.\r\n\r\nThe earliest occasion on which the railway was made use of for the\r\nconveyance of sick and wounded from a scene of actual hostilities to the\r\nrear was on the occasion of the _Crimean War_, when the little military\r\nline between Balaklava and the camp before Sebastopol, of which an\r\naccount will be given in Chapter XV, was so employed. The facilities\r\nafforded were, however, of the most primitive character. Only the\r\nwagons used for the transport of supplies to the front--wagons, that is\r\nto say, little better than those known as \"contractors' trucks\"--were\r\navailable, and there were no means of adapting them to the conveyance\r\nof sufferers who could not be moved otherwise than in a recumbent\r\nposition. Sitting-up cases could, therefore, alone be carried; but what\r\nwas to develop into a revolution in the conditions of warfare was thus\r\nintroduced, all the same.\r\n\r\nIn the _Italian war of 1859_ both the French and the Austrians made use\r\nof the railways for the withdrawal of their sick and wounded, and, in\r\nhis \"Souvenir de Solferino,\" Jean Henri Dumant, the \"Father\" of the Red\r\nCross Movement, speaks of the transportation of wounded from Brescia to\r\nMilan by train to the extent of about 1,000 a night. No arrangements for\r\ntheir comfort on the journey had been made in advance, and the changes\r\nin the military situation were so rapid, when hostilities broke out,\r\nthat no special facilities could be provided then. All that was done\r\nwas to lay down straw on the floor of the goods or cattle trucks used\r\nfor the conveyance of some of the more serious cases. The remainder\r\ntravelled in ordinary third-class carriages, and their sufferings on the\r\njourney, before they reached the long and narrow sheds put up along the\r\nrailway lines at Milan or elsewhere to serve as temporary hospitals,\r\nmust often have been very great. They may, nevertheless, have escaped\r\nthe fate of those who died, not from their wounds, but from the fevers\r\nquickly generated in the overcrowded hospitals at the front, where there\r\nwas, besides, a general deficiency of ambulance requirements of all\r\nkinds. The good resulting from the removal by train is, indeed, said to\r\nhave been \"immense.\"\r\n\r\nThese experiences in the campaign of 1859 led to a recommendation\r\nbeing made in the following year by a _German_ medical authority, Dr.\r\nE. Gurlt,[17] that railway vehicles should be specially prepared for\r\nthe conveyance of the sick and wounded in time of war. The plan which\r\nhe himself suggested for adoption was the placing of the sufferers in\r\nhammocks suspended from hooks driven into the roof of the goods van or\r\ncarriage employed, mattresses being first put on the hammocks, when\r\nnecessary. By this means, he suggested, the sufferers would travel much\r\nmore comfortably than when seated in the ordinary passenger carriages,\r\nor when lying on straw in the goods wagons or cattle trucks.\r\n\r\nDr. Gurlt's pamphlet served the good purpose of drawing much attention\r\nto the subject, and his proposals were duly subjected to the test of\r\nexperiment. They failed, however, on two grounds,--(1) because the roofs\r\nof the goods vans, designed for shelter only, were not sufficiently\r\nstrong to bear the weight of a number of men carried in the way\r\nsuggested; and (2) because the motion of the train caused the hammocks\r\nto come into frequent contact with the sides of the wagon, to the\r\nserious discomfort of the occupants.\r\n\r\nIn November of the same year (1860) the Prussian War Minister, von Roon,\r\nappointed a Commission to enquire into the whole subject of the care\r\nof the sick and wounded in time of war, and the question of transport\r\nby rail was among the various matters considered. As a result of these\r\ninvestigations, the Minister issued, on July 1, 1861, an order to the\r\neffect that in future the less seriously wounded should travel in\r\nordinary first, second or third-class carriages, according to the degree\r\nof comfort they required, care being taken to let them have corner\r\nseats; while for those who were seriously ill, or badly wounded, there\r\nwere to be provided sacks of straw having three canvas loops on each\r\nside for the insertion of poles by means of which the sacks and the\r\nsufferers lying upon them could be readily lifted in or out of the goods\r\nwagons set apart for their conveyance. In these wagons they were to be\r\nplaced on the floor in such a way that each wagon would accommodate\r\neither seven or eight. In the event of a deficiency of sacks, loose\r\nstraw was to be used instead. The door on one side of the truck was to\r\nbe left open for ventilation. A doctor and attendants were to accompany\r\neach train, and they were to have a supply of bandages, medicines and\r\nappliances. Of the last-mentioned a list of five articles was appended\r\nas obligatory. The medical officer was to visit the wagons during the\r\nstoppages, and the attendants on duty in the wagons were to carry flags\r\nso that, when necessary, they could signal both for the train to pull\r\nup and for the doctor to come to the sufferers.\r\n\r\nThis was as far as Prussia had got by 1861, when the arrangements stated\r\nwere regarded as quite sufficient to meet the requirements of the\r\nsituation. Real progress was to come, rather, from the other side of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the _War of Secession_ (1861-65) the arrangements\r\nfor the conveyance by rail of the sick and wounded from the\r\nbattle-fields of the Eastern States to the hospitals in the large\r\ncities were still distinctly primitive. Those who could sit up in the\r\nordinary cars were conveyed in them. Those who could not sit up, or\r\nwould be injured by so doing, were carried to the railway, by hand, on\r\nthe mattresses or stretchers they had occupied in the hospitals to which\r\nthey had first been taken. At the station the mattresses were placed on\r\nthick layers of straw or hay strewn over the floors of the freight cars\r\nin which supplies had been brought to the front. Large window spaces\r\nwere cut in the sides or ends of the cars to provide for ventilation.\r\nOn some occasions, when hay or straw was not available, pine boughs or\r\nleaves were used instead. As only the floor space was occupied no more\r\nthan about ten patients could be carried comfortably in each car, though\r\nas many as twenty were occasionally crowded in. The wide doors of the\r\nbox cars readily permitted of the beds being lifted in or out. Medical\r\nofficers, with supplies, accompanied each train. On arrival at New\r\nYork, Washington, Philadelphia, Harrisburg, or other destination, the\r\nsufferers were taken out and carried, still on the same mattresses or\r\nstretchers, to the hospitals there.\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of sick or wounded were conveyed by rail under one or\r\nother of these conditions, and the work was done with great expedition.\r\nBetween the morning of June 12 and the evening of June 14, 1863, over\r\n9,000 wounded, victims of the Federal disaster at Chancellorsville,\r\nwere taken by the single-track Aquia Creek railroad from Aquia Creek to\r\nWashington. Many even of the severely wounded declared they had suffered\r\nno inconvenience from the journey. After the battle of Gettysburg, July\r\n1-3, 1863, more than 15,000 wounded had been sent by rail from the\r\nfield hospitals to Baltimore, New York, Harrisburg or Philadelphia by\r\nJuly 22. An even more rapid distribution was effected after the battles\r\nof the Wilderness and Spottsylvania when, with a few exceptions, the\r\ntransfer to the hospitals in the cities mentioned was effected in the\r\ncourse of a few days. Following on the battle of Olustree (February 20,\r\n1864), the serious cases were removed on the Mobile Railway by freight\r\ncars bedded with pine boughs, palmetto leaves and a small quantity of\r\nstraw, each patient having a blanket, in addition.\r\n\r\nAs an improvement on these methods of transport, the plan was adopted\r\nof fixing rows of upright wooden posts, connecting floor and ceiling,\r\non each side of a car as supports for two or three tiers of rough\r\nwooden bunks, a central gangway through the car being left. In this\r\nway the available space in the car was much better utilised than\r\nwith the straw-on-floor system. Next, in place of the bunks, came an\r\narrangement by which the stretchers whereon the patients lay could be\r\nsecurely lashed to the uprights; while this was followed, in turn, by\r\nthe insertion of wooden pegs into the uprights and the placing on them\r\nof large and strong india-rubber rings into which the handles of the\r\nstretchers could readily be slipped, and so suspended. The first car so\r\narranged came into use in March, 1863.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Philadelphia Railroad Company had, at the end of 1862,\r\nfitted up an ambulance car on the principle of a sleeping car, but so\r\nplanned that the stretchers on which the sufferers lay could be made to\r\nslide in or out of the wooden supports. This particular car was capable\r\nof accommodating fifty-one patients, in addition to a seat at each end\r\nfor an attendant. Other innovations introduced on the car were (1) a\r\nstove at which soups could be warmed or tea made; (2) a water tank, and\r\n(3) a locker.\r\n\r\nWhat the introducers of these improvements mainly prided themselves\r\nupon was the fact that the patient could remain, throughout the entire\r\njourney from field hospital to destination, on the stretcher he had been\r\nplaced on at the start. The adoption of this principle necessitated,\r\nhowever, uniformity in the dimensions of the stretchers in order that\r\nthese could always be accommodated on the ambulance-car fittings.\r\n\r\nThe next important development was reached when the ambulance _car_,\r\nrun in connection with ordinary trains, and used for exceptionally\r\nsevere cases, was succeeded by the ambulance _train_. Here came further\r\ninnovations, the nine or ten \"ward-cars,\" of which such a train mainly\r\nconsisted in the Eastern States, being supplemented by others fitted\r\nup as dispensary and store-room, kitchen, and quarters for surgeon,\r\nattendants, and staff of train, besides carrying all necessary\r\nappliances and provisions for the journey.\r\n\r\nWhat was now specially aimed at was to make the train as close an\r\napproach to an actual hospital on wheels as circumstances would\r\npermit. \"At present,\" wrote the Medical Director of the Department of\r\nWashington, \"the sick and wounded are transferred in cars ill-adapted\r\nfor the purpose and with difficulty spared from the other pressing\r\ndemands; and lives are lost on the route not infrequently which, in all\r\nprobability, might be saved by a more comfortable and easy method of\r\ntransportation.\" The train he caused to be constructed consisted of ten\r\nward-cars, one car for the surgeon and attendants, one as a dispensary\r\nand store-room, and one as a kitchen, etc. The ward-cars, arranged on\r\nan improved principle, each accommodated thirty recumbent and twenty or\r\nthirty seated patients. The train was to run regularly on the Orange and\r\nAlexandria Railroad between the theatre of war and the base hospitals at\r\nAlexandria and Washington. It was either to supplement or to supersede\r\nthe freight cars with their bedding of straw, hay or leaves. If only\r\nfrom the point of view of the inadequate supply of rolling stock, a car\r\nfitted up to accommodate fifty or sixty patients offered an obvious\r\nadvantage, in the speedy removal and distribution of sick and wounded,\r\nover a car, without fittings, in which the floor space alone could be\r\nutilised.\r\n\r\nSeveral complete trains of the type stated were soon running on the\r\nOrange and Alexandria Railroad, within the Union lines, and the\r\nhospital train thus became an established institution in modern warfare.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, in connection with the chief army in the West, the Army\r\nof the Cumberland, operating under General George H. Thomas, that the\r\nuseful purposes which could be served by hospital trains became most\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe need for them in the West was even greater than in the East,\r\nbecause the distances to be covered were greater and lay, also, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, in enemy country.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1863 and the winter of 1864, as narrated in the \"Medical\r\nand Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion,\" the chief army of the\r\nWest was concentrated principally along the line of railroads leading\r\nfrom Nashville, Tennessee, to the South-west, viâ Chattanooga, Tenn.,\r\nand onwards towards Atlanta, Georgia. At the outset the sick and wounded\r\nwho could travel in ordinary passenger cars to points in the North were\r\nso taken. Severe cases had to remain in the nearest available hospital\r\ndepôt. In addition to the discomfort suffered by the former in having\r\nto travel in cars not suited to invalids, they were liable to frequent\r\nand prolonged delays on the single-track lines by reason of the constant\r\npassing of supply trains proceeding to the front; and not unfrequently\r\nthe detentions were at points where nothing could be obtained for\r\nfeeding the sufferers or making them comfortable, while even if rations\r\ncould be drawn the train afforded no means of cooking them. So it was\r\nresolved to have a train which would be the equivalent of an ambulating,\r\nself-contained hospital, capable of carrying both recumbent and\r\nsitting-up patients and supplying all their wants on the journey.\r\n\r\nOn August 11, 1863, instructions were sent from the\r\nAssistant-Surgeon-General's Office to the Medical Officer of the Army\r\nof the Cumberland directing him \"to take immediate measures to fit up a\r\nspecial train for hospital purposes, with every possible comfort,\" to\r\nrun between Nashville, Ten., and Louisville, Ken. General Thomas, in\r\nturn, accorded the fullest authority to the Medical Officer to select\r\nfor the purpose the best locomotives and the best cars to be found among\r\nthe railway rolling stock, and to have new cars fitted up whenever\r\nnecessary. He further directed that the most experienced drivers,\r\nconductors and other necessary railway employés should be selected for\r\nthe conduct of the hospital-train service.\r\n\r\nThree of these trains were ready by the spring of 1864, and they ran\r\nregularly--each taking a section of the journey--between Atlanta and\r\nLouisville, a distance of 472 miles. They consisted, apparently, in\r\npart of specially-built and in part of adapted rolling stock, the\r\nlarge open American passenger cars, with their greater freedom from\r\ninternal fittings than ordinary European railway carriages, lending\r\nthemselves specially to the purpose. In the converted passenger cars\r\nthe carrying of the stretchers through the end doors was avoided by\r\nremoving two windows and the panelling underneath them from the side of\r\nthe car, and making an opening 6 ft. in width which could be closed by\r\na sliding door. Each train provided five ward-cars (converted passenger\r\ncars) for lying-down patients; a surgeon's car (a passenger car from\r\nwhich the seats had been removed, with partitions and fittings for the\r\naccommodation of the doctor and his helpers); a dispensary car (in which\r\nan ample supply of medicines, instruments and appliances was carried);\r\nan ordinary passenger car for sitting-up patients or convalescents; a\r\nkitchen car (divided into kitchen, dining-room and store-room); and\r\na conductor's car. The kitchen car was supplied with a small cooking\r\nrange, boilers, and other requisites for the feeding of from 175 to\r\n200 patients. The cars were warmed and lighted in winter, and special\r\nattention was paid to ventilation, so that Dr. F. L. Town, of the\r\nUnited States Army, was able to report of them:--\"In visiting these\r\nhospital trains, the air is found sweet and pure, the wards are neat\r\nand inviting; and it may unhesitatingly be said that men on hospital\r\ntrains are often as comfortable and better fed and attended than in many\r\npermanent hospitals.\" The trains had distinguishing signals which were\r\nrecognised by the Confederates, and none of them were ever fired on or\r\nmolested in any way.\r\n\r\nOne, at least, of the trains was despatched daily from the vicinity of\r\nthe field hospitals. The services rendered by them during the last\r\neighteen months of the war were of the greatest value. It has been said,\r\nindeed, that the combined effect of all the provision made for the care\r\nof the sick and wounded and their speedy recovery--including therein, as\r\none of the most important items, their prompt removal and distribution\r\nby rail--was to ensure for the Federals the retention of a force equal\r\nin itself to an army of 100,000 men. No single fact could show more\r\nconclusively the _strategical_ as well as the humanitarian value of\r\nrailway ambulance transport.\r\n\r\nThese details as to what was accomplished in the American Civil War are\r\nthe more deserving of record because they show that the evolution of the\r\n\"hospital on wheels,\" from the initial conditions of a bedding of straw\r\non the floor of a railway goods wagon, was really carried out, step by\r\nstep, in all its essential details, in the United States. The hospital\r\ntrain was thus _not_ an English invention, as is widely assumed to be\r\nthe case; though much was to be done here to improve its construction,\r\nequipment and organisation.\r\n\r\nWhilst America had been gaining all this very practical experience, the\r\n_Danish War of 1864_ had given Prussia the opportunity of testing the\r\nsystem approved by her in 1861 for the conveyance of the less severely\r\nwounded in ordinary passenger carriages and of the seriously wounded on\r\nsacks of straw laid on the floor of goods wagons. The results were found\r\nso unsatisfactory that on the conclusion of hostilities a fresh series\r\nof investigations and experiments was begun, and matters were still at\r\nthis stage when war broke out between Prussia and Austria.\r\n\r\nThe conditions in regard to the care of the sick and wounded in the\r\n_campaign of 1866_ were deplorably defective. Not only, according to\r\nDr. T. W. Evans[18]--an American medical man, settled in Paris, who\r\nvisited the battle-field and assisted in the work of relief--was there\r\nno advance on what had been done in the United States, but the American\r\nexample was in no way followed, the combatants having made no attempt\r\nwhatever to profit from her experience.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Sadowa, thousands of wounded were left on the\r\nbattle-field, and many remained there three days and three nights before\r\nthey could be removed in the carts and wagons which were alone available\r\nfor the purpose. Within five days every village in a radius of four\r\nleagues was crowded with wounded. Those taken to Dresden and Prague in\r\nordinary passenger carriages or goods vans were detained for days on\r\nthe journey owing to the congestion of traffic on the lines. Some of\r\nthem, also, were in the trains for two days before their wounds were\r\ndressed. Then the use of straw, depended on by the Austrians, was found\r\nto be unsatisfactory. It failed to afford the sufferers a sufficient\r\nprotection against the jolting of the wagons, especially when they\r\nworked through it to the bare boards; and even then there was not always\r\nsufficient straw available to meet requirements. Altogether, it is\r\ndeclared, the wounded suffered \"unheard-of tortures.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after the conclusion of the war there was appointed in _Prussia_\r\na further Commission of medical and military authorities to renew the\r\ninvestigation into the care and transport of sick and wounded. The\r\nCommission sat from March 18 to May 5, 1867. In the result it still\r\nfavoured the use of sacks of straw, with canvas loops, as the simplest\r\nand most comfortable method to adopt for the rail transport of recumbent\r\nsufferers, though it recommended that the sacks should be made with\r\nside pieces, giving them the form of paillasses, as this would afford a\r\ngreater degree of support to those lying on them. The American system of\r\nsuspending stretchers in tiers by means of india-rubber rings depending\r\nfrom pegs let into wooden uprights was disapproved of, partly because\r\nof the continuous swinging of the stretchers so carried, and partly\r\nbecause of the assumed discomfort to one set of patients of having\r\nothers just above them. The report also recommended the adoption of\r\nthe following principles:--(1) Through communication between all the\r\ncarriages employed in one and the same train for the conveyance of sick\r\nand wounded; (2) provision, for the severely wounded, either of beds\r\nwith springs or of litters suspended from the roof or the sides of the\r\ncarriages; and (3) extra carriages for the accommodation of doctor,\r\nnurses, surgical appliances, medical stores, cooking utensils, etc.\r\n\r\nThese principles were subjected to various tests, and it was found that\r\nin Germany the existing carriages which could best be adapted to the\r\ndesired purpose were those belonging to the fourth-class, inasmuch as\r\nthey had no internal divisions or fittings, travellers by them being\r\nexpected either to stand during the journey or to sit on their luggage.\r\nThe only structural alteration necessary was the placing of the doors at\r\nthe end of the carriages instead of at the sides, so that, on opening\r\nthese end doors, and letting down a small bridge to be provided for the\r\npurpose, access could readily be obtained from one carriage to another.\r\nInstructions were accordingly given that all fourth-class carriages\r\non the Prussian railways should thenceforward have end doors--an\r\narrangement which had, in fact, already been adopted in South Germany.\r\nSteps were also taken in Prussia to adapt goods vans and horse boxes\r\nfor the conveyance of sick and wounded in the event of the number of\r\nfourth-class carriages not being sufficient to meet requirements.\r\n\r\nThe widespread interest which was being attracted throughout Europe to\r\nthe subject of the care of the sick and wounded in war led to a series\r\nof experimental trials being carried out at the _Paris International\r\nExhibition of 1867_, when, with the help of a short line of railway laid\r\ndown in the exhibition grounds and of a goods wagon supplied by the\r\nWestern of France Railway Company, a number of different systems were\r\ntested. On this occasion, also, a model of an American car fitted up\r\nwith india-rubber rings for the handles of stretchers was shown.\r\n\r\nAt this time, and for many years afterwards, the ideal arrangement was\r\nconsidered, on the Continent of Europe, to be one under which railway\r\nvehicles sent to the front with troops, supplies or munitions could be\r\nreadily adapted for bringing back the sick and wounded on the return\r\njourney; and alike in Germany, Russia, France, Austria and Italy the\r\nrespective merits of a great variety of internal fittings designed to\r\nadapt existing rolling stock, whether passenger coaches, luggage vans,\r\nPost Office vans or goods wagons, to the serving of these dual purposes\r\nformed the subject of much experiment and controversy. Rope cables\r\nacross the roof of a goods wagon, with dependent loops of rope for\r\nthe reception of the stretcher handles (as in the Zavodovski method);\r\nstretchers laid on springs on the floor, suspended from the roof either\r\nby strong springs or by rope, resting on brackets attached to the\r\nsides, or partly resting and partly suspended; and collapsible frames\r\nof various kinds, each had their respective advocates.[19] The use and\r\nequipment of ambulance or hospital trains constituted, also, a regular\r\nsubject of discussion at all the international congresses of Red Cross\r\nSocieties which have been held since 1869.\r\n\r\nThe experimental trials at the Paris Exhibition of 1867 were followed\r\nby the appointment in _Prussia_ of still another Commission of inquiry,\r\nand, acting on the recommendations of this body, the Prussian Government\r\nadopted the \"Grund\" system, under which the stretchers whereon the\r\nrecumbent sufferers lay in the goods wagons or fourth-class carriages\r\nwere placed on poles resting in slots over the convexity of laminated\r\nsprings having one end screwed into the floor while the other, and\r\nfree, end was provided with a roller designed to respond to the varying\r\nconditions of weight by sliding to and fro. This was the system mainly\r\nused in the \"sanitary trains\" of the Germans in the _Franco-Prussian\r\nWar of 1870-71_. It was criticised on the ground (1) that the sick\r\nand wounded were still subject to the same jolts and concussions as\r\nordinary seated passengers; (2) that the number who could be carried per\r\ncarriage or wagon was very small, since it was still the case that only\r\nthe floor space was utilised; and (3) that it was inconvenient for the\r\ndoctor and the attendants to have to kneel down in order to attend to\r\nthe patients.[20] Apart from these disadvantages, the ambulance service\r\nof the Germans was well organised during the war. Of ambulance trains,\r\nfitted up more or less as complete travelling hospitals, twenty-one were\r\nrun, and the total number of sufferers removed by rail is said to have\r\nbeen over 89,000.\r\n\r\nOwing to traffic congestions, the transport to Berlin of wounded from\r\nthe army engaged in the investment of Paris occupied no less a period\r\nthan six days; but these journeys were made in the special ambulance\r\ntrains which, provided in the later stages of the war, ensured full\r\nprovision for the feeding, nursing and general comfort of the sufferers.\r\nThe fact that such journeys could be undertaken at all showed the great\r\nadvance which had been made since the battle of Sadowa, when most of the\r\nwounded could be conveyed no further than to cottages and farm-houses in\r\nneighbouring villages.\r\n\r\nIn the _South-African War of 1899-1902_ the system favoured was that\r\nof having hospital trains either expressly built for the purpose or\r\nadapted from ordinary rolling stock and devoted exclusively, for the\r\nduration of the war, to the conveyance of the sick and wounded. The\r\n\"Princess Christian\" hospital train, specially constructed for the\r\nBritish Central Red Cross Committee by the Birmingham Railway Carriage\r\nand Wagon Company Ltd., according to the plans of Sir John Furley and\r\nMr. W. J. Fieldhouse, and sent out to South Africa early in 1900,\r\nconsisted of seven carriages, each about 36 ft. in length, and 8 ft.\r\nin width, for running on the Cape standard gauge of 3ft. 6in. The\r\ncarriages were arranged as follows:--I., divided into three compartments\r\nfor (_a_) linen and other stores, (_b_) two nurses and (_c_) two invalid\r\nofficers; II., also divided into three compartments, for (_a_) two\r\nmedical officers; (_b_) dining-room and (_c_) dispensary; III., IV.,\r\nV., and VI., ward-cars for invalids, carried on beds arranged in three\r\ntiers; VII., kitchen, pantry, and a compartment for the guard. The train\r\ncarried everything that was necessary for patients and staff even though\r\nthey might be cut off from other sources of supply for a period of two\r\nor three weeks.\r\n\r\nSeven other hospital trains, all adapted from existing rolling stock\r\nin Cape Colony or Natal, were made available for the transport of sick\r\nand wounded in the same war. One of these, No. 4, was arranged and\r\nequipped at the cost of the British Central Red Cross Committee, under\r\nthe direction of Sir John Furley, then acting as the Society's Chief\r\nCommissioner in South Africa. The arrangement of the other converted\r\ntrains was carried out by the Army Medical Service in South Africa,\r\nwith the co-operation of the Government Railway officials in Cape Town\r\nand Natal. A number of specially-fitted carriages, placed at convenient\r\ndistances on the railways occupied by the British, were made use of to\r\npick up small parties of sick from the various posts along the lines,\r\nsuch carriages being attached to passing trains for the conveyance\r\nof the sufferers to the nearest hospital. Many of them had a regular\r\nservice up and down a particular stretch of railway. Some were provided\r\nwith iron frames for the support of service stretchers, and others were\r\nfitted up similarly to the ward-carriages of the converted hospital\r\ntrains. Convalescents and \"sitting-up\" patients for whom no special\r\naccommodation was necessary travelled in such ordinary trains as might\r\nbe available.\r\n\r\nIn effect, there are four classes of trains by which, under the\r\nconditions of to-day, the sick and wounded may be despatched from the\r\nseat of war:--(1) Permanent hospital trains, specially constructed for\r\nthe purpose; (2) temporary hospital trains, made up either entirely\r\nof converted ordinary vehicles or partly of converted and partly of\r\nspecially-constructed rolling stock, their use for this purpose\r\ncontinuing for the duration of the war; (3) ambulance trains improvised\r\nat railhead out of rolling stock bringing troops, supplies and stores to\r\nthe front, the internal fittings for \"lying-down\" cases being of such\r\na kind that they can be readily fixed or dismantled; and (4) ordinary\r\npassenger carriages for slightly wounded or convalescents.\r\n\r\nThe advantages conferred on armies from a strategical point of view,\r\nunder all these improved conditions, are no less beyond dispute than\r\nthe benefits conferred on the individual soldiers, and if railways had\r\ndone no more in regard to the conduct of warfare than ensure these dual\r\nresults, they would still have rendered a service of incalculable value.\r\nWhile, also, their provision of an efficient ambulance transport system,\r\nwith its speedy removal of non-effectives, has served the purposes\r\nof war, it has, in addition, by its regard for the sick and wounded\r\nthemselves, further served to relieve warfare of some, at least, of its\r\nhorrors.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] A saying attributed to Napoleon is that he preferred a dead soldier\r\nto a wounded one.\r\n\r\n[17] \"Ueber den Transport Schwerverwundeter und Kranker im Kriege, nebst\r\nVorschlägen über die Benutzung der Eisenbahnen dabei.\" 33 pp. Berlin,\r\n1860.\r\n\r\n[18] \"Les Institutions Sanitaires pendant le Conflit\r\nAustro-Prussien-Italien.\" Par Thomas W. Evans. Paris, 1867.\r\n\r\n[19] For \"A short consideration and comparison of the regulations for\r\nthe transport of sick and wounded by rail, as laid down in four of the\r\nleading Continental armies (the German, French, Austrian and Italian),\"\r\nsee a paper on \"Continental Regulations for the Transport of Sick and\r\nWounded by Rail,\" by Surg.-Capt. C. H. Melville, A.M.S., _Royal United\r\nService Institution Journal_, vol. 42 (1898), pp. 560-594.\r\n\r\n[20] In an article on \"Military Hospital Trains; their Origin and\r\nProgress,\" in _The Railway Gazette_ of December 4, 1914, it is said:\r\n\"The comparatively small loss of the Germans by death from wounds in\r\n1870 was due solely to the fact that they entered upon the war with what\r\nwere then considered wonderfully elaborate arrangements for removing the\r\nwounded.... The trains were composed partly of first-class carriages,\r\nfor the less badly wounded, and partly of covered goods wagons.... In\r\nthese covered vans were placed beds formed of boards laid on springs.\r\nEach van would hold four or five men, and a sister rode in the van.\" One\r\nwould not, however, consider to-day that there was anything wonderfully\r\nelaborate in an arrangement under which no more than four or five\r\nsufferers were accommodated in each goods van.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPREPARATION IN PEACE FOR WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater the experience gained of the application of rail-power\r\nin practice, and the closer the study devoted to its possibilities,\r\nin theory, the more obvious it became that the fullest degree of\r\nadvantage to be derived therefrom could only be assured as the result\r\nof preparation and organisation in peace; and this conclusion appeared\r\nspecially to apply to countries whose geographical and political\r\nconditions led them to regard it as expedient that they should always\r\nbe ready to meet some great national emergency. The Federal Government\r\nof the United States certainly did succeed, in the early sixties,\r\nin creating an excellent military rail-transport organisation after\r\nhostilities had broken out; but the conditions of warfare to-day make\r\nit essentially necessary that arrangements for the use of railways for\r\nmilitary purposes should, as far as possible, be planned, perfected or\r\nprovided for long in advance of any possible outbreak of hostilities.\r\n\r\nAmong other considerations which strengthen this view are the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nI. The increasing dependence of armies on rail transport owing to\r\n(_a_) the vastly greater number of troops employed now than in former\r\ndays; (_b_) the supreme importance of time as a factor in enabling\r\na Commander-in-Chief to effect, possibly, an earlier concentration\r\nthan the enemy, and so obtain the power of initiative; and (_c_) the\r\nmagnitude of the supplies, munitions and other necessaries wanted to\r\nmeet the daily wants of the prodigious forces in the field, and only\r\nto be assured by the employment of rail transport from a more or less\r\ndistant base.\r\n\r\nII. The complications, confusion and possible chaos which may result\r\nif, without prior preparation, railway lines designed to serve ordinary\r\ntransport purposes are suddenly required to meet military demands taxing\r\ntheir resources to the utmost extreme.\r\n\r\nIII. The further troubles that will assuredly arise if, in the\r\nabsence of efficient control by properly-constituted and responsible\r\nintermediaries, railwaymen unfamiliar with military technicalities\r\nare left to deal with the possibly conflicting and impracticable\r\norders of individual military officers themselves unfamiliar with the\r\ntechnicalities and limitations of railway working.\r\n\r\nIV. The imperative necessity of having an organised and well-regulated\r\nsystem of forwarding military supplies, etc., in order both to avoid\r\ncongestion of stations and lines and to ensure the punctual arrival of\r\nthose supplies in the right quantities, at the right spot, and at the\r\nright time.\r\n\r\nV. The need, in view of the vital importance of the part that railways\r\nmay play in war, of having organised forces of railway troops and\r\nrailway workers available, together with stores of materials and\r\nappliances, to carry out, speedily and thoroughly, all the work that\r\nmay be necessary for the repair, construction or destruction of railway\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nIn making the necessary preparations, in time of peace, to ensure the\r\nsuccessful realisation of these and other purposes, there is a vast\r\namount of work that requires to be done.\r\n\r\nIn readiness for the excessive strain that will be thrown on the\r\nrailways as soon as they pass from a peace footing to a war footing, on\r\nthe order being given for mobilisation, the military authorities and\r\nthe railway authorities must needs have at their command the fullest\r\ninformation as to the physical conditions, the resources and the\r\ntransport capabilities of every line of railway in the country which,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, may be able to render useful service. Details as\r\nto double or single track; gradients; number of locomotives, carriages,\r\nwagons, horse-boxes and other vehicles available; and facilities\r\nafforded by stations in important centres as regards number and length\r\nof platforms and sidings, water supply, loading, unloading or storage\r\naccommodation, etc., are all carefully compiled and kept up to date.\r\nAs regards rolling stock, lines not likely to be called upon to carry\r\nany military transports at all may still be able to contribute to the\r\nsupply of carriages and wagons wanted to meet the heavy demands on other\r\nrailways. By including all lines of railway in the collected data, it\r\nwill be known exactly where additional rolling stock may be obtained\r\nif wanted. The carrying capacity of the different types of carriages,\r\ntrucks, etc., is also noted. If necessary, arrangements will be made for\r\nthe reduction of gradients, the improvement of curves, the construction\r\nof connecting links between different main lines, the lengthening of\r\nstation platforms, or the provision of increased loading or unloading\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the information collected elaborate calculations are\r\nmade in regard to such matters as (1) the number of vehicles required\r\nfor a given number of men, with horses, guns, munitions, stores, road\r\nvehicles, etc., so that rolling stock can be used to the best advantage\r\nand according as to whether the troops carried belong to the Infantry,\r\nCavalry or the Artillery; (2) the number of vehicles that can be made\r\nup into a train going by any one route; (3) the length of time likely\r\nto be taken for the entraining and detraining respectively of a given\r\nunit; (4) the time intervals at which a succession of troop trains can\r\nfollow one another on the same line; (5) the speed of troop trains; and\r\n(6) the further intervals to be allowed in the arrival at one and the\r\nsame station, or centre, of a number of trains starting from different\r\npoints, so as to avoid the risk of congestion and of consequent delays.\r\n\r\nMilitary time-tables, corresponding to those in everyday use, have\r\nnext to be prepared, showing exactly what trains must run from given\r\nstations, at fixed hours, by clearly defined routes, to specified\r\ndestinations as soon as the occasion arises. The great aim kept in view\r\nin the compilation of these time-tables is, not alone preparation in\r\nadvance, but the most complete utilisation possible of the available\r\ntransport facilities of the country as a whole.\r\n\r\nA selection must also be made in advance of the stations at which troops\r\non long journeys can obtain food, as well as of the stations to be used\r\nas depôts for stores and supplies, all the necessary arrangements being\r\nprovided for.\r\n\r\nAfter the initial great strain on the railway resources involved in\r\nmobilisation and concentration, there will still be an enormous amount\r\nof transport to be done during the campaign. In the one direction there\r\nwill be a constant despatch of reinforcements, provisions, clothing,\r\nmunitions and supplies or stores to the front; in the other direction\r\nthere will be a steady flow of sick and wounded, of prisoners of war,\r\nand of materiel not wanted at the front, followed by the final return\r\nhome of the troops at the end of the campaign.\r\n\r\nAt each important point along the lines of communication where special\r\nservices in connection with the rail transport, in either direction, are\r\nto be rendered, there must be organisation of such kind as will ensure\r\nthat whatever is necessary shall be done promptly and efficiently under\r\nthe control of persons of recognised authority and responsibility, and\r\nwithout any of the friction that would, inevitably, lead to delays,\r\ntraffic blocks and other complications.\r\n\r\nNor can the same system of organisation apply to the whole line of\r\ncommunication, from the base to the limit of the rail service at the\r\nfront. A point will be reached therein where the control, if not the\r\nactual operation, of the railway lines must needs be transferred from\r\nthe civil to the military authorities, rendering necessary a scheme of\r\nsupervision and working different from that which can be followed on the\r\nsections not within the actual theatre of war.\r\n\r\nThen, if the army should be compelled to retreat before the enemy,\r\nthere should be available a sufficiency of forces skilled in the art of\r\nrapidly and effectively destroying lines, bridges, viaducts, tunnels, or\r\nother railway property, with a view to retarding the enemy's movements\r\nuntil, it may be, reinforcements can be brought up in sufficient number\r\nto check his further progress. If, alternatively, the army should\r\nadvance into the enemy's country, there must again be a provision of\r\nRailway Troops fully qualified by previous training and experience both\r\nto repair quickly the demolitions or the damage which the enemy will\r\nhave carried out on his own lines and to construct hastily such new\r\nlines--light railways or otherwise--as the circumstances of the moment\r\nrequire. These things done, and still further advance being made into\r\nthe invaded territory, the need will also arise for a staff capable of\r\noperating, under war conditions, the lines of which possession has been\r\ntaken, in order that communications with the advanced front and the\r\nforwarding of reinforcements and supplies can still be maintained.\r\n\r\nAll these and many other things, besides, must needs be thought out and\r\nprepared for in time of peace, long in advance of any probable or even\r\nany possible war. They are, in fact, made the subject of exhaustive and\r\ncontinuous study alike by military officers specially entrusted with\r\nthe task and by railway managers commanding all the technical knowledge\r\nrequisite for making arrangements calculated to ensure the prompt and\r\nefficient satisfaction of all such demands for military rail-transport\r\nas may, with whatever urgency, and under whatever conditions, some day\r\nbe put forward.\r\n\r\nStill more practical do the preparations in peace for war become when\r\nthey include the construction of a network of strategical railways\r\nexpressly designed to facilitate the mobilisation of troops, their\r\nspeedy concentration on the frontier, or their movement from one point\r\nof attack to another at the theatre of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nORGANISATION IN GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no country in the world was the desirability of preparing in time of\r\npeace for military rail-transport in time of war recognised earlier than\r\nin Germany. In none has the practice of such preparation in peace been\r\nfollowed up with greater study and persistence.\r\n\r\nAs shown in Chapter I, the military use of railways led to the proposal\r\nand discussion in Germany of definite schemes for such use as early as\r\n1833; and it is not too much to say that, from that date down to the\r\noutbreak of the World-War in 1914, the whole subject had received there\r\nan ever-increasing degree of attention from the military authorities,\r\nand, also, from a large body of writers as a question of the day in its\r\nrelation more especially to German expansion.\r\n\r\nOne great mistake, however, made alike by historians, by writers in the\r\nPress, and by popular tradition, has been the attributing to Germany of\r\na far higher degree of credit in regard to the alleged perfection of\r\nher preparations for the _Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71_ than she was\r\nreally entitled to claim. Nor, indeed, has the fact been sufficiently\r\nrecognised that the organisation eventually elaborated by Germany for\r\nthe efficient conduct of her rail-transport in war had been evolved\r\nfrom studies, investigations, trials, experiments and tests (in actual\r\nwarfare or otherwise) extending over a period of half a century or more,\r\nduring which time, also, there was issued a bewildering mass of laws,\r\nrules and regulations, each more or less modifying those that had gone\r\nbefore and adding still further to the elaborate, if not the extremely\r\ncomplicated, machinery laboriously built up as the result of the\r\nuniversally recognised genius of the German people for organisation.\r\n\r\nThe final great test of all this machinery was to be applied in 1914.\r\nHere, however, it must suffice, for present purposes, to show how the\r\nmachinery itself was created and the form it finally assumed.\r\n\r\nDown to 1861 Prussia had done no more, in the way of organising military\r\ntransport by rail, than issue a series of Ordinances dealing with the\r\nmovement of large bodies of troops, such Ordinances being akin to those\r\nwhich all the leading countries of Europe had either compiled or were\r\nengaged in compiling. Directly influenced by the developments of the\r\nCivil War in America, Prussia took the further step, in 1864, of forming\r\na Railway Section of her General Staff. This new body was actively\r\nemployed in the furtherance of Prussia's interests in the Danish War of\r\nthe same year, when confirmatory evidence was given of the advantages\r\nto be derived from the use of rail transport for military movements,\r\njourneys that would have taken the troops sixteen days by road being\r\ndone within six days by rail.\r\n\r\nThe organisation thus applied on a comparatively small scale in 1864 was\r\nfurther developed by Prussia in the _campaign of 1866_.\r\n\r\nOn that occasion mobilisation and concentration of the Prussian troops\r\nwere both carried out mainly by rail, under the direction of an\r\nExecutive Commission consisting of an officer of the General Staff and\r\na representative of the Ministry of Commerce. This Executive Commission\r\nsat in Berlin, and was assisted by Line Commissions operating on the\r\ndifferent railways utilised for military purposes. Movements of troops\r\nby rail were certainly effected in one-third of the time they would have\r\ntaken by road, while the Prussians, gaining a great advantage, by the\r\nrapidity of such movements, over Austria, routed her combined forces\r\nwithin seven days of crossing the frontier, and dictated terms of peace\r\nto her within a month.\r\n\r\nSome serious faults were nevertheless developed, even in the course of\r\nthis very short campaign, in Prussia's rail-transport arrangements,\r\nsuch being especially the case in regard to the forwarding of supplies.\r\nThese were rushed to the front in excess of immediate requirements, the\r\nonly concern of contractors or of officers at the base being to get them\r\naway, while the railway companies--bound to accept goods for transport\r\nand delivery as ordered--dispatched them without regard for any possible\r\ndeficiency in the unloading and storage arrangements at the other\r\nend. The supplies, forwarded in bulk, followed as close up behind the\r\ntroops as they could be taken; but the provision made for unloading was\r\ninadequate, the railway staffs disclaimed responsibility for the work,\r\nand, before long, stations and sidings at the front were hopelessly\r\nblocked, although elsewhere the shortage of wagons was so great that\r\neverything was at a standstill. Even when wagons had been unloaded, they\r\nwere too often left on the lines, in long trains of empties, instead of\r\nbeing sent where they were most needed. Each railway company disposed\r\nof its own rolling stock independently of the other companies, adopting\r\nthe view that it had no concern with what was happening elsewhere. In\r\nsome instances special trains were dispatched for the conveyance of a\r\nfew hundred men or a few hundredweights of stores. Orders which should\r\nhave gone direct from one responsible person to another went through\r\na variety of channels with the result that serious delays and no less\r\nserious blunders occurred. One East Prussian Battalion, for instance,\r\nwas sent off by train in a direction exactly opposite to that which it\r\nshould have taken.\r\n\r\nAll these and other troubles experienced were directly due to the\r\nabsence of a central controlling body formed on such a basis that\r\nit could (1) govern the rail-transport arrangements as a whole;\r\n(2) supervise the forwarding of supplies; (3) provide for a proper\r\ndistribution, and better utilisation, of rolling stock; (4) secure\r\nthe prompt unloading and return of wagons, and (5) form a direct link\r\nbetween the military authorities and the railway managements and staffs.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the close of the war a mixed committee of Staff officers\r\nand railway authorities was appointed, under the supervision of von\r\nMoltke, to inquire what steps should be taken to organise the Prussian\r\nmilitary transport services on such a basis as would avoid a repetition\r\nof the faults already experienced, and give a greater guarantee of\r\nefficiency on the occasion of the next war in which Prussia might be\r\nengaged. The desirability of making such preparations in time of peace\r\ndoubtless appeared the greater in proportion as it became more and more\r\nevident that the trial of strength between Prussia and Austria would\r\ninevitably be followed by one between Prussia and France.\r\n\r\nThe scheme elaborated by the committee in question took the form of a\r\n_Route Service Regulation_ which was approved by the King on May 2,\r\n1867, and was, also, adopted by most of the other German States, but was\r\nkept secret until the time came for applying it in practice, as was done\r\nin the war of 1870-71.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the scheme was the creation of a system of _Route\r\nInspection_ (\"Etappen Inspektion\") constituting a department of the\r\nGeneral Staff, and designed--\r\n\r\nI. To watch over the replenishing of the operating army with men,\r\nhorses, provisions, ammunition, and other military stores.\r\n\r\nII. To see to the removal into the interior of the country of the sick\r\nand wounded, prisoners and trophies of war.\r\n\r\nIII. With the assistance of the troops appointed for the purpose and\r\nthe Railway Field Corps, to maintain the line of communication, viz.,\r\nrailway, roads, bridges, telegraphs, and postal arrangements; to\r\nundertake the government of the hostile conquered provinces, and other\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the necessary plans for the attainment of these\r\nobjects was entrusted to a _Central Commission_ composed, partly of\r\nofficers connected with the General Staff and the Ministry of War, and\r\npartly of prominent functionaries on the staffs of the Ministry of\r\nCommerce, Industry and Public Works (then in supreme control over the\r\nrailways), and of the Minister of the Interior. Two of its members--a\r\nStaff Officer and a railway expert from the Ministry of Commerce--formed\r\nan _Executive Commission_ and exercised a general supervision over the\r\narrangements for military transports; though on the removal of the\r\nGreat Head-quarters from Berlin, the Executive Commission was to be\r\nsucceeded by an _Auxiliary Executive Commission_, which would supervise\r\nthe railways in the interior to be made use of for supplying the needs\r\nof the army.\r\n\r\nIn time of war the Central Commission was to be supplemented by _Line\r\nCommissions_ formed by military officers and railway officers in\r\ncombination, and operating each in a leading centre of railway traffic.\r\nTheir function it would be--with the assistance of _District Line\r\nCommissions_--not only to communicate to the line or lines of railway in\r\ntheir district such orders as might be necessary for the transport of\r\ntroops, guns, ammunition, horses, and supplies, but, also, to draw up\r\nor make the final arrangements in connection with the time-tables for\r\nthe running of military trains; to fix the direction in which the trains\r\nwould go; to decide at what stations the troops should stop for their\r\nmeals or for their coffee; and, in fact, to arrange everything connected\r\nwith the said transport down to--as it appeared at the time--the\r\nsmallest details.\r\n\r\nIn the forwarding of supplies, each Army Corps was to have its own line\r\nof communication, separate and distinct from that of the other Army\r\nCorps, the object aimed at being that of avoiding the confusion and\r\ndisorder which might result from the fact of several Army Corps using\r\nthe same railway.\r\n\r\nEach of such lines of communication would start from some large railway\r\nstation forming a _Point of Concentration_ (\"Etappenanfangsort\") for the\r\ncollection and the dispatch therefrom of supplies for the Army Corps it\r\nwould serve, or for the receipt and further distribution in the interior\r\nof persons or commodities coming back from the seat of war.\r\n\r\nAlong the line of railway, at distances of about 100 or 125 miles,\r\nstations were to be selected which would serve as halting-places for the\r\nfeeding of troops, for the watering of horses, for the reception of sick\r\nand wounded unable to continue their journey, for the repair of rolling\r\nstock, or for other such purposes. The furthest point to be reached by\r\nrail from day to day would constitute _Railhead_ (\"Etappenhauptort\"),\r\nwhence communication with the fighting line would be carried on by road,\r\nbeing further facilitated by _Halting Places_ (\"Etappenörter\") _en\r\nroute_.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this elaborate organisation--and here we come to the\r\nweakest point in the system--was to be under the supreme direction\r\nand control of an _Inspector-General of Communications_--a sort of\r\nUniversal Provider of every requirement the Army could possibly need,\r\nand responsible for the fulfilment of a long and exceedingly varied list\r\nof obligations among which the conduct of military rail-transport became\r\nsimply one of many items. The special merit of his position was assumed\r\nto be that of a superior authority who, having the rank of Commandant of\r\na Division, and being in constant touch both with the Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the Army and with the War Minister, would be able to establish\r\nharmony in the operations of the different services and corps. The\r\nprinciple itself was sound; but, in practice, such a multiplicity of\r\nduties fell upon him, or, through him, on his department, that the\r\nbreak-down which actually occurred in the campaign of 1870-71 should\r\nhave been foreseen in advance.\r\n\r\nOn the declaration of war the Inspector-General was to organise the\r\nstations for the feeding of the troops and horses proceeding to the\r\nfront, and was then himself to go to some station one or two marches\r\nfrom the fighting-line, and fix, each day, the Railhead Station for the\r\ntime being, moving his own head-quarters as occasion might require.\r\nFrom these head-quarters he was to exercise control and direction over\r\na staff among whose duties--apart from those relating to railways\r\nor rail-transport--were the following:--A centralisation of all the\r\nservices through a Chief of the Staff giving a common impulse to them\r\naccording to the instructions of the Inspector-General; the forwarding\r\nof all troops to the front, special precautions having to be taken\r\nthat none were left behind; distribution of the troops on arrival at\r\ntheir destination; the forwarding of all supplies; decision of all\r\npersonal questions that might arise in connection with the troops;\r\nthe keeping of journals and registers, the drawing up of reports,\r\nand the carrying on of correspondence with the War Minister and the\r\nChiefs of the army; everything concerned with horses for the troops,\r\ntransport and distribution of prisoners of war, and maintenance of good\r\norder among the troops; assurance of an ample supply of ammunition\r\nfor the artillery; construction or provision of barracks, huts, or\r\ntemporary hospitals; maintenance of roads and telegraphs; control\r\nof telegraphs and postal services at the seat of war; supervision\r\nof road communications; responsibility for the safe and regular\r\ndelivery to the troops of all supplies and necessaries ordered to meet\r\ntheir requirements, and establishment of hospitals, infirmaries and\r\nconvalescent homes, with the arrangements for the removal thereto of the\r\nsick and wounded.\r\n\r\nIn regard to railway matters, the Inspector-General was assisted by a\r\n_Director of Field Railways_ who, in turn, had many duties to perform.\r\nActing in the name and with the authority of the Inspector-General,\r\nhe gave directions to the Line Commissions concerning the succession\r\nin which supplies were to be forwarded, and, in conjunction with\r\nthe military and railway authorities, drew up the time-tables for\r\nmilitary transports, submitting them, however, for the approval of\r\nhis chief before they were put into operation. The actual transport\r\nof troops and material--on the basis of principles the details of\r\nwhich would have been worked out in advance--was also to be conducted\r\nunder the supervision of the Director of Railways. In the event of\r\nany of the lines being destroyed by the enemy, he was to undertake\r\ntheir reconstruction, obtaining through the Inspector-General such\r\nhelpers--whether soldiers or civilians--as he might require to\r\nsupplement his own working staff in the accomplishment of the necessary\r\nwork. On the lines being restored, the Director was further to take\r\ncontrol of their operation by means of troops and, also, of railway\r\nemployés to be furnished by the Minister of Commerce on the requisition\r\nof the Inspector-General of Communications.\r\n\r\nSuch was the elaborate machinery which, constructed alike in peace and\r\nin secret by the Great General Staff, under the direct supervision of\r\nvon Moltke himself, was to be tested in the inevitable war with France\r\nfor which it had been designed.\r\n\r\nAccording to popular belief, Germany's preparations for that war were\r\nso complete that she had only, as it were, to press a button, or pull\r\na lever, in order to ensure the immediate and perfect working of all\r\nthe plans she had made in advance. Whether or not this was really so\r\nin regard to her transport arrangements, at least, is a point to which\r\nattention may now be directed.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war a _Route Inspection_, organised on the basis\r\nalready detailed, and having its own Inspector-General of Communications\r\nin charge of, and responsible for, the efficient working of the entire\r\nnetwork of duties and obligations, was called into being for each of the\r\nthree German armies. Subsequently a fourth, under the Crown Prince of\r\nSaxony, was added.\r\n\r\nSo far as the mobilisation of the German troops and their concentration\r\non the frontier were concerned the plans worked, on the whole,\r\nremarkably well; though even in this respect complete success was not\r\nattained. There were, in 1870, nine lines of concentration available,\r\nnamely, six for the Northern and three for the Southern Army; and\r\nbetween July 24 and August 3, there were dispatched by these different\r\nroutes 1,200 trains, conveying 350,000 men, 87,000 horses, and 8,400\r\nguns or road vehicles. Yet the delays which occurred to some of these\r\ntrains were alone sufficient to show that the machinery which had been\r\nelaborated was not working with perfect smoothness. On, for example, the\r\nroute known as line \"C,\" the troops sent to Giessen were--as told by\r\nBalck, in his \"Taktik\"--eleven hours late in their arrival. They then\r\nhad their first warm food after a journey which had lasted twenty-one\r\nhours. For the transport to Homburg-in-der-Pfalz and Neunkirchen forty\r\nhours had been allowed. The first train did the journey in the time, but\r\nthe next one took ninety hours.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, in the forwarding of supplies and in the provisioning\r\nof the troops that the greatest difficulties were experienced; and here\r\nthere certainly appeared to be little real advance on the shortcomings\r\nof the campaign of 1866, notwithstanding all the preparations which had\r\nbeen made in the meantime.\r\n\r\nComprehensive as it undoubtedly was, the scheme prepared in time of\r\npeace included no adequate organisation for regulating the transport of\r\nsupplies to the front and for ensuring alike their dispatch and their\r\narrival in just such quantities, and under just such conditions, as\r\nwould provide for the needs of the troops from day to day. Magazines\r\nhad certainly been set up, but not in sufficient number or always in\r\nthe right place. The system, too, of operating them was defective.\r\nJust as in 1866, so in 1870, army officers, contractors and railway\r\ncompanies, all inspired by zeal for the welfare of the troops, rushed\r\noff train-load after train-load of supplies to stations provided\r\nwith an inadequate supply alike of sidings where the wagons could be\r\naccommodated and of labour for the work of unloading. Stores were handed\r\nto the railway staffs under the same conditions as in peace time, the\r\nidea being, apparently, that if they were only dispatched as soon as\r\npossible they would be sure to get to the troops in want of them.\r\n\r\nAs for the conditions at the other end, it not unfrequently happened\r\nthat even though the supply-trains might go to stations where the\r\nfacilities for unloading them were ample, the Commissariat or other\r\nofficers in charge would follow the example already being set in France\r\nby regarding loaded railway trucks as convenient movable magazines\r\nwhich should not be unloaded until their contents were really wanted.\r\nThis was done regardless of the fact alike that the trucks thus kept\r\nstanding on the lines impeded the traffic and that they were urgently\r\nwanted to meet the shortage of trucks elsewhere. But for the stringent\r\naction taken to check it, the evil due to this use of railway trucks for\r\nstorage purposes would have assumed even graver proportions than was\r\nactually the case. Defective, also, as the German arrangements in this\r\nrespect undoubtedly were, they still did not attain to the same degree\r\nof inefficiency as was the case in France.\r\n\r\nAll the same, the general result of these various conditions was that\r\nserious difficulties were experienced on the German no less than on the\r\nFrench railways. No sooner had the concentration of the Prussian troops\r\nbeen completed than provisions and stores were sent after them in such\r\nvolume that a hopeless block, extending to Cologne in one direction and\r\nFrankfort in the other, was speedily produced on the lines along the\r\nleft bank of the Rhine, while the feeding of the troops was brought to\r\na temporary standstill. The combined efforts of the Prussian Executive\r\nCommission, of the Minister of Commerce and of the Line Commissions\r\nfailed for a time to overcome the conditions of chaos and confusion thus\r\nbrought about, and on August 11, 1870, instructions had to be given that\r\nthenceforward supplies were to be forwarded only on the express order of\r\nthe Intendant-General or of an Inspector-General of Communications. Yet\r\non September 5 there were standing, on five different lines, a total of\r\nno fewer than 2,322 loaded wagons, containing 16,830 tons of provisions\r\nfor the Second Army, or sufficient to keep it supplied for a period of\r\ntwenty-six days. Such blocks on the German lines--though not always on\r\nso great a scale--were of frequent occurrence throughout the war.\r\n\r\nTrouble arose, also, in getting provisions from the railway to the\r\ntroops by reason either of the inadequate number of road vehicles or\r\nbecause of the use of these for the conveyance of ammunition or for\r\nother purposes, instead. Thus the Inspector-General of the First Army\r\nstarted with 2,000 road vehicles; but on October 17 the total number\r\nstill at his disposal was only twenty. The position became still worse\r\nas the retreating French destroyed the lines behind them, increasing the\r\ndifficulties of the invaders in maintaining their communications with\r\nthe Fatherland.\r\n\r\nWhile the food supplies for the German troops were thus blocking the\r\nrailway lines--or, alternatively, were going bad on account either\r\nof the heated conditions of the closed wagons or of exposure to the\r\nweather after unloading--many of the German troops were suffering severe\r\nprivations from lack of adequate nourishment; and they would have\r\nsuffered still more but for the provision-trains or stores of supplies\r\nseized from the French at Metz, Forbach, Verdun, Dôle, Le Hans, and\r\nelsewhere. If, indeed, the French had only refrained from rushing their\r\nown supplies to the extreme front in excessive quantities, or if they\r\nhad destroyed those they could not remove in time, the invaders would,\r\non various occasions, have found themselves in a condition bordering on\r\nstarvation. Even as it was, they were often reduced to the necessity of\r\ndependence on their \"iron\" rations.\r\n\r\nDifficulty was especially experienced in feeding the army of occupation\r\nduring the investment of Paris. The supplies received by train from\r\nGermany were equal to scarcely one half of the actual requirements;\r\na resort to \"requisitions\" on the French territory occupied yielded\r\ninadequate results; and the making of a regular daily money-allowance\r\nto officers and men, so that they could purchase their own supplies in\r\nthe open market or otherwise, was, at first, far from satisfactory. It\r\nwas, in fact, only owing to the most strenuous effort on the part of the\r\nresponsible officers, both during the investment of Paris and in earlier\r\nphases of the war, that the German troops were often saved from actual\r\nwant.[21]\r\n\r\nThe main reasons for the defects and shortcomings thus developed in a\r\nscheme on which so much care and preparation had been bestowed were\r\n(1) that, while based on fundamentally sound principles, the scheme in\r\nits actual application threw too great a strain on the department of\r\nthe Inspector-General of Communications, which, as we have seen, was\r\nexpected to look after, not only rail transport, but route marching,\r\ntelegraphs, postal arrangements, and a great variety of other things\r\nbesides; (2) that, owing to the larger number of Army Corps, it was no\r\nlonger possible, as had been done in 1866, to place a separate line of\r\nrailway at the disposal of each, so as to allow the said department to\r\nsuperintend the traffic on the basis of its own organisation; and (3)\r\nthe absence of a central administration specially designed (_a_) to\r\nact as an intermediary and to ensure co-operation and mutual working\r\nbetween the various Line Commissions and, also, between the individuals\r\nand administrations, both military and civil, engaged in the conduct of\r\nrail-transport; and (_b_) to control the traffic as a whole, avoiding\r\ndifficulties, blocks and delays assuring a prompt and efficient\r\ndistribution of supplies, and guaranteeing the utilisation of rolling\r\nstock to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nWith a view to overcoming, as far as possible, the trouble due to the\r\nwide extent and the great variety of duties falling on the department\r\nof the Inspector-General of Communications, it was arranged, during\r\nthe latter part of the war, to relieve that department of all\r\nresponsibility for the railway services and to transfer the control and\r\ndirection of these to the Executive Commission established at the Royal\r\nHead-quarters. In this way it was hoped to utilise the rail-transport\r\nfacilities to greater advantage, to decrease the risk of collisions\r\nand delays, and, through a central organisation, to distribute the\r\ntransport demands more equally among the various railways concerned.\r\nBy means of these provisional modifications in the original scheme a\r\nbetter system of operation was obtained during the remainder of the\r\nwar. But the complete reorganisation that was really necessary was then\r\nimpracticable, and much friction in the working of the railway services\r\nwas still experienced, partly because this needful reorganisation could\r\nnot be carried out, and partly because of the conflicting orders coming\r\nfrom different authorities, each of whom, under the conditions then\r\nexisting, was perfectly within his right in giving them.[22]\r\n\r\nThe difficulties due to the attempts to rush supplies in excessive\r\nquantities direct to the fighting-line, or as near thereto as possible,\r\nwere also met, to a certain extent, during the course of the war, by\r\nthe setting up of additional railway magazines or depôts where the\r\nforwarding of necessaries could be better controlled; but it was not\r\nuntil the end of 1870 that any approach to regularity in supplying the\r\nwants of the German forces was finally secured.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the war come to an end than the work of remedying the\r\ndefects which had been developed was taken in hand by the Minister of\r\nWar and the Great General Staff. Following the creation, on October\r\n1, 1871, of a Railway Battalion on a permanent basis came, on July\r\n20, 1872, a new Regulation cancelling the one of May 2, 1867, which\r\nhad been in operation during the war, and substituting a new basis of\r\norganisation in its place.\r\n\r\nWhile retaining the principle of a Central Commission in Berlin, the\r\nscheme of 1872 relieved the route authorities of all responsibility\r\nfor rail transport as well as for railway restoration and operation\r\nat the theatre of war, transferring to a new military department all\r\nthe duties falling under these heads, with the further advantage\r\nthat such department would be able to control the railways in time\r\nof war independently of the civil authorities, and without the\r\ndisadvantages hitherto resulting from the need to deal, in regard to\r\nrailway questions, with nine separate Ministries of Commerce and about\r\nfifty different railway companies. At the same time the principle\r\nof co-ordination was to be maintained by the appointment of an\r\n_Inspector-General of Railways and Lines of Communication_ who, in each\r\nof these departments, would control a far more efficient organisation\r\nthan had previously existed, and, also, as director-in-chief, would\r\nconstitute a central authority and an intermediary between the services\r\nconcerned and the head of the Great General Staff, under whose direction\r\nhe would himself act.\r\n\r\nAnother important feature of the new Regulation was that a distinction\r\nwas now drawn between (1) railways on or near to the theatre of war\r\nwhich could not be worked by their ordinary staffs, and must needs pass\r\nunder military operation, with a paramount military control; and (2)\r\n\"home\" or other railways, in the rear of the fighting, which might\r\ncarry ordinary traffic--except so far as the lines were wanted for\r\nmilitary purposes--and might still be worked by their own staffs, but in\r\nthe operation of which there should be a military element in time of war\r\nin order to facilitate the transport of troops and military necessaries.\r\n\r\nVarious other Regulations, and notably a series in 1878 and 1888,\r\nfollowed that of 1872, and eventually the whole scheme of organisation,\r\nwith its additions and modifications, seeking to provide for every\r\npossible contingency, became extremely complicated. Of the multifarious\r\ninstructions, provisions and orders which had been compiled, some\r\napplied to peace only, some to war only, and some to both peace and war;\r\nsome to \"home\" railways and some to railways at the seat of war; some\r\nto military men and some to railway men, and so on. As an elaborate\r\npiece of machinery the organisation was more comprehensive and more\r\ncomplete than ever; but the fear arose that there had again been a\r\nfailure to take the human element sufficiently into account. Of those in\r\nthe military and the railway service who should have applied themselves\r\nin time of peace to a study of the elaborate and extremely involved\r\nprovisions which would apply in time of war, comparatively few, it was\r\nfound, were disposed to devote themselves to so uninviting a task.\r\n\r\nSo there was issued, on January 18, 1899, still another new Regulation\r\nwhich repealed some of the earlier ones and aimed at amplifying,\r\ncondensing, rearranging and facilitating reference to the provisions\r\nremaining in force, in order that the whole scheme should be made\r\nclearer, simpler and easier to grasp. These results were fully attained,\r\nand, though still subject to the final test of a great war, such as that\r\nwhich broke out in 1914, the German Regulation of 1899 might certainly\r\nbe considered a masterpiece of organisation as prepared in time of\r\npeace. One especially useful purpose it served was that of defining\r\nclearly the duties, responsibilities, and spheres of action of all the\r\nauthorities, civil or military, concerned in the control and operation\r\nof railways for military purposes.\r\n\r\nThe various Regulations here in question have been supplemented from\r\ntime to time by _Field Service Regulations_, the first series of which,\r\nissued under date May 23, 1887, was designed to take the place of the\r\nOrdinances of 1861 relating to the movement by rail of great bodies of\r\ntroops. These Field Service Regulations of 1887 constituted an epoch\r\nin the military history of Germany. They were regarded at the time as\r\noffering a resumé of the most advanced ideas of Moltke, if not, also,\r\nas the crowning glory of military organisation in the reign of William\r\nI; and they certainly exercised a powerful influence on German military\r\nliterature. They were, further, the starting-point of a prolonged\r\nseries of similar Regulations, all amending, modifying, adding to, or\r\nabbreviating their predecessors. These changes led to the issue, on\r\nJanuary 1, 1900, of a new edition, based on the exhaustive studies of a\r\nCommission of fourteen members; and still later revisions resulted in\r\nthe publication of a further series on March 22, 1908.[23]\r\n\r\nHere, then, we get still further evidence of the keenness with which\r\nGermany has followed up, in times of peace, her preparations for war,\r\nwhile the Field Service Regulations, no less than the other Regulations\r\nalready detailed, show the important place that military rail-transport\r\nholds in the view of those responsible in Germany for the making of\r\nthese arrangements. \"Railways,\" it is declared in the Regulations of\r\n1908, \"exercise a decisive influence on the whole conduct of a war. They\r\nare of the greatest importance for mobilising and concentrating the\r\narmy, and for maintaining it in a state of efficiency, and they enable\r\nportions of it to be transported from one place to another during the\r\noperations.\" What the Field Service Regulations do is to present in\r\nconcentrated and compact form the working details, in respect to field\r\nservice requirements, of those other and fuller Regulations which cover\r\nthe whole ground of military transport in general.\r\n\r\nTaking these various sources of information, the nature of the\r\norganisation that Germany has thus effected as the result of so many\r\nyears of study and experience may be summarised as follows:--\r\n\r\nIn time of peace the authorities entrusted with the task of ensuring,\r\nby their preparations in advance, the success of the whole system of\r\nmilitary rail-transport include (1) the Minister of War; the Prussian\r\nChief of the General Staff of the Army; the members of the Railway\r\nSection of the Great General Staff, the Line Commissions and the\r\nStation Commissions; authorities concerned in the forwarding, transport\r\nand receiving of supplies, and representatives of the Commissariat\r\ndepartment; and (2) the Imperial Chancellor, the Imperial Railway\r\nBureau, the Imperial Administration of Posts and Telegraphs, and the\r\nvarious railway administrations.\r\n\r\nThe _Prussian Minister of War_ is the chief representative of the\r\ninterests of the Army in all questions relating to the military use of\r\nthe railways.\r\n\r\nThe _Prussian Chief of the General Staff_ of the Army has under his\r\norders, in time of peace, the military authorities concerned in\r\nrail-transport, and gives them the necessary instructions. He keeps\r\nin close relations with the Imperial Railway Bureau, and serves as\r\nintermediary between that Bureau and the Prussian Minister of War. It is\r\nhe who gives the directions according to which the use of the railways\r\nin war-time is regulated, and he prescribes all the preparations\r\nthat are to be made in advance for the facilitating of such use. On\r\nmobilisation, he discharges all the duties appertaining to the office\r\nof the Inspector-General of Railways and Lines of Communication until\r\nthat officer has himself taken them in hand. From that time he issues\r\ninstructions according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe _Railway Section of the Great General Staff_ is required, among\r\nother duties, to collect, and have always available, the fullest and\r\nmost complete information as to the powers and facilities of the\r\nrailways for the transport of troops, etc. To this end it keeps in\r\nconstant communication with the railway administrations, and, also,\r\nwith the Imperial Railway Bureau (which centralises all questions\r\naffecting railway administration), completing, if necessary, through\r\ninvestigations made by its own officers, the information furnished\r\nannually by the Bureau. The Railway Section further takes charge\r\nof a wide range of details and preparations concerning military\r\nrail-transport in war-time.\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of hostilities there is appointed for each theatre of\r\nwar an _Inspector-General of Railways and Lines of Communication_ who,\r\nreceiving his orders from the Chief of the General Staff, co-ordinates\r\nthe two groups of services, and ensures harmony in their joint\r\nworking. For the operation of the railways, as applied to military\r\npurposes, there is a _Director of Field Railways_ who, acting under the\r\nInspector-General, controls the whole railway service. Through the Line\r\nCommissions or Commandants subordinate to him he conveys to the railway\r\nauthorities the necessary demands or instructions in respect to military\r\ntransport, and, in concert with his superior officers, he fixes the\r\nboundary between the lines to be operated on a peace footing and those\r\nthat are to be subject to military working. In the discharge of these\r\nand other duties he is assisted by a staff composed partly of military\r\nmen and partly of railwaymen. Each officer concerned in the transport\r\narrangements has a recognised deputy who can act for him in case of need.\r\n\r\nOf _Line Commissions_, placed in charge, for military purposes,\r\nover the lines of railway in certain districts, and becoming _Line\r\nCommandants_ on the outbreak of war, there were twenty under the revised\r\nRegulation of 1899, the number being increased in 1904 to twenty-one.\r\nThe headquarters of these Commissions are at such centres of traffic as\r\nBerlin, Hanover, Erfurt, Dresden, Cologne, Altona, Breslau, etc. They\r\nserve as intermediaries between the higher military authorities and\r\nthe railway administrations with which they are associated. Each Line\r\nCommission consists, normally, of a staff officer of the active army and\r\na prominent railway functionary, the former having a non-commissioned\r\nofficer, and the latter a railway official, as secretary, with such\r\nfurther assistance as may be needed.\r\n\r\nSubordinate, in turn, to the Line Commissions are the _Station\r\nCommissions_, which, receiving instructions from the former, see to the\r\ncarrying out of the necessary transport requirements either at their\r\nparticular station or on the section of line of which they are placed in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nWhile full provision is thus made for the representation of the military\r\nelement in the conduct of rail-transport in time of war, with a view\r\nto ensuring its efficiency, precautions are no less taken to avoid\r\nrepetitions of earlier troubles due to questions of responsibility and\r\ncontrol, and, more especially, to the interference of military officers\r\nin the technical operation of the railway lines. On this subject the\r\nField Service Regulations of 1900 stated (paragraph 496):--\r\n\r\n    Railways can only fully accomplish their important and\r\n    difficult task during war if no serious hindrances to their\r\n    management are created by the conduct of the troops.\r\n\r\nIn the later Regulations of 1908 it was said (paragraph 527):--\r\n\r\n    The important rôle which railways have to fulfil renders it\r\n    incumbent on every commander to do all in his power to prevent\r\n    any interference with the traffic due to delay, etc., on the\r\n    part of the troops. The railway staff and conducting officers\r\n    are bound by the transport arrangements made by the railway\r\n    authorities.\r\n\r\n    The conducting officer is responsible for the administration\r\n    of the detachment of troops or consignment of stores under his\r\n    charge. It is his duty, as regards himself and his charge, to\r\n    obey the instructions of the railway officials.\r\n\r\n    Any interference with the service of the railways is\r\n    forbidden.\r\n\r\n    At important stations Railway Staff Officers are appointed\r\n    who act as intermediaries between the conducting officers and\r\n    the railway officials.\r\n\r\nConcerning _Lines of Communication_ the Field Service Regulations of\r\n1908 say:--\r\n\r\n    A railway station, to serve as a Home Base\r\n    (\"Etappenanfangsort\") will be assigned to every Army Corps. From\r\n    these home bases supplies are sent forward to Collecting Depôts\r\n    (\"Sammelstationen\"), which will be established at not too great\r\n    a distance from the theatre of war.\r\n\r\n    In the theatre of war a base will be assigned to each Army,\r\n    the situation of which will change according to the progress\r\n    of the operations. The Army Corps are connected with the Field\r\n    Base by lines of communication roads (\"Etappenstrassen\"), and on\r\n    these roads posts are formed about 13½ miles apart.\r\n\r\nAs for the mass of working details also included in the various\r\nRegulations, these may well appear to provide in advance for every\r\npossible requirement in regard to military transport by rail, from\r\nthe movement of entire armies down to the supply of drinking water at\r\nstations and the taking of carrier pigeons in the troop trains.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] In \"Der Kriegs-Train des deutschen Heeres,\" by E. Schäffer,\r\n(Berlin, 1883), the author, dealing with the subject of transport\r\nin the war of 1870-71, and its effect on the feeding of the German\r\nArmy, says of the situation in August-September, 1870: \"Immerhin\r\nwurden den Truppen damals nicht unerhebliche Entbehrungen auferlegt\";\r\nwhile concerning the position of the army of occupation in France he\r\nwrites: \"Immerhin erforderte es umfassender Massregeln seitens der\r\nIntendantur, die Truppen vor wirklichem Mangel zu schützen, namentlich\r\nda die Requisitionen wenig ergiebig ausfielen, und anfänglich auch der\r\nfreihändige Ankauf keinen rechten Erfolg hatte.\"\r\n\r\n[22] \"Revue militaire de l'Étranger,\" 27 Novembre, 1872.\r\n\r\n[23] \"Field Service Regulations (Felddienst Ordnung, 1908) of the German\r\nArmy.\" Translated by the General Staff, War Office. London, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nRAILWAY TROOPS IN GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe innovation introduced into modern warfare by the Federal Government\r\nof the United States, in the organisation on a comprehensive scale of a\r\nConstruction Corps for the combined purposes of repairing, destroying\r\nand operating the railways on which so much might depend in the conduct\r\nof war, attracted great attention in Europe, and more especially so in\r\nGermany, which was the first country on this side of the Atlantic to\r\nfollow the American precedent, since adopted more or less completely by\r\nall nations possessed alike of railways and a standing army.\r\n\r\nDown to the time of the War of Secession the need for such a corps\r\nhad not been realised in Europe; but the advantages which might be\r\ngained therefrom had been shown in so unmistakable a form that when,\r\nin 1866, there was the certainty of an early conflict between Prussia\r\nand Austria, one of the first steps taken by the former country was to\r\nprovide, under a decree of May 6, 1866, for a _Field Railway Section_,\r\n(\"Feldeisenbahnabteilung,\") to be formed, and designed to operate,\r\non a basis closely approximating to that which had applied to the\r\ncorresponding American corps. The special purposes to be served were\r\ndefined as those of rapidly repairing lines of railway destroyed by\r\nthe enemy and of destroying railways it might be thought expedient to\r\nprevent the enemy from using. The section was to be under the orders\r\nof the General Staff either of the Army or of an Army Corps. It was,\r\nhowever, not to come into being until its services were really required,\r\nand it was then to act for the duration of the war only.\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of hostilities three divisions of the corps were\r\nmobilised, under Cabinet Orders of May 25 and June 1, one division\r\nbeing allotted to each of the three Prussian armies operating in\r\ndifferent parts of the theatre of war. The composition of the corps was\r\npartly military and partly civil. The military element was supplied by\r\nofficers of the Engineers (one of whom acted as chief), non-commissioned\r\nofficers, and a detachment of Pioneers, the last-mentioned being either\r\ncarpenters or smiths. The civil element comprised railway engineers,\r\nthoroughly acquainted with the construction and repair of permanent\r\nway, bridges, etc.; assistant railway engineers, performing the duties\r\nof clerks of the works; head platelayers, foremen, locomotive drivers,\r\nmachinists (for the repair of engines, rolling-stock, water pumps\r\nand water tanks), and others. The members of the civil section were\r\nchosen from the staff of the Prussian State railways by the Minister of\r\nCommerce, their services being placed by him at the disposal of the War\r\nMinister. Each of the three divisions constituted a complete unit.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the Austrians there was at that time no similar force\r\navailable. Three years before there had been published in Vienna\r\na book, by Oberst. von Panz, entitled \"Das Eisenbahnwesen, vom\r\nmilitärischen Standpuncte,\" in which the author expressed the view that\r\ndetails on the following points, among others, concerning railways\r\nshould be collected in time of peace and classified for reference\r\nin case of need:--Permanent way: system and construction; gauge and\r\nnumber of lines; whether lines single or double. Stations: size and\r\nconstruction; which of them best fitted to serve as depôts. Bridges:\r\nunderground works, etc.; which of these could be the most easily\r\ndestroyed, or soonest repaired if destroyed, and if prepared beforehand\r\nfor destruction. Embankments: size; how made; slope; if provided\r\nwith culverts and size of these. Cuttings: length and depth; slopes;\r\nnature of ground; whether much or little water, and whether danger of\r\nlandslips. Tunnels: dimensions and construction; if lined or cut in\r\nrock; nature of cuttings at end and whether they can be blocked. Large\r\nbridges and viaducts: system of construction; span of arches; whether or\r\nnot the piers are mined.[24] Where men, tools, stores and materials can\r\nbe obtained, and to what extent.\r\n\r\nThese recommendations attracted much attention at the time. They\r\nwere quoted by H. L. Westphalen in his book on \"Die Kriegführung\r\nunter Benutzung der Eisenbahnen\" (Leipzig, 1868), of which a French\r\ntranslation was published under the title of \"De l'Emploi des Chemins\r\nde Fer en Temps de Guerre\" (Paris, 1869); yet when, just before the\r\noutbreak of war with Prussia, the Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian\r\nNorthern Army recommended that a Construction Corps should be formed,\r\nthe Minister of War replied that \"the repair of railways was work which\r\nshould be done by the railway companies concerned.\"\r\n\r\nAll the same, the retarding of the Prussian advance by interrupting\r\nthe rail communications became an important phase of Austrian tactics\r\nand was followed up with great activity. Bridges and viaducts were\r\ndestroyed, rails torn up, sleepers burned, points and turntables carried\r\naway, tunnels obstructed and water cranes and pumps rendered useless.\r\nAt one place (between Libenau and Sichrau), where the railway passed\r\nthrough a deep cutting, the explosion of mines along the top of each\r\nbank detached great masses of rock which, falling on the lines, filled\r\nup the cutting to a height of six or eight feet for a distance of about\r\n250 ft., and could not be removed until, by means of blasting, they had\r\nbeen broken up into pieces sufficiently small to be carried away in\r\nballast trucks.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements made by the Prussians were, however, so complete as to\r\npermit, in most instances, of a speedy restoration. Even in the instance\r\njust mentioned, fifty Pioneers, aided by twenty labourers, had the line\r\nclear for traffic again before midnight of the day the destruction was\r\ncaused.\r\n\r\nEach division of the Construction Corps had at its disposal two\r\nlocomotives and thirty closed wagons or open trucks, provision thus\r\nbeing made for the transport of, among other things, six light covered\r\ncarts (for use on the roads in the country to be invaded, horses being\r\nrequisitioned therein as necessary); tools; supplies of blasting powder\r\nor gun-cotton; and rails, sleepers, bolts, etc., for 250 yards of\r\nrailway, reserve materials for a further quarter of a mile of track\r\nbeing left at intermediate depôts, supplemented by an unlimited supply\r\nat the base of operations. The construction trains also carried timber,\r\nropes, nails, scaffolding, clamps, etc., for the prompt repair of\r\nsmall bridges. Materials for larger bridges or viaducts were stored at\r\nconvenient centres.\r\n\r\nHow the reconnaissance of a line which might have been subjected to the\r\nenemy's destructive tactics was carried out is thus told by Captain C.\r\nE. Webber, R.E., in his \"Notes on the Campaign in Bohemia in 1866\":--\r\n\r\n    The reconnaissance starts with, and, until interrupted,\r\n    keeps up with, the advance guard, the movement being covered by\r\n    cavalry scouts on each side of the line.\r\n\r\n    The greater portion of the train in charge of the\r\n    department, with one engine in front and another behind,\r\n    advances slowly, preceded at a distance of about 500 paces by a\r\n    trolley carrying one of the officers, four men to work it, and\r\n    a bugler. On arriving at any obstruction the trolley signals\r\n    to the train by bugle and extra caution is used in advancing\r\n    towards it. If in presence of the enemy, the scouts give warning\r\n    to the officer in the trolley, who returns to the train and the\r\n    whole retires. The second engine can be detached from the rear\r\n    to send messages or bring up fresh supplies.\r\n\r\nBut for the successes already gained in the same direction by the\r\nFederals in the United States, the speed with which repairs were\r\ncarried out by the Prussian Construction Corps--then so recently\r\norganised--would have been regarded as remarkable. In various instances\r\ncommunication was restored within from one and a half to three days\r\nafter the destruction even of important bridges.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, however, whilst the Austrians had shown an excess of\r\nzeal in some directions by destroying bridges when the tearing up\r\nof the rails would have answered the same purpose, the hesitation\r\nof the responsible Austrian officer to fire the mines which had\r\nalready been laid to the bridge over the Elbe at Lobkowitz was of\r\ngreat advantage to the Prussians, leaving them the use of the line\r\nfrom Turnau to Prague, Pardubitz and Brünn between July 18 and July\r\n27, on which latter date the bridge was at last destroyed by order\r\nof the governor of Theresienstadt. This particular bridge was one of\r\nexceptional strategical importance, and, according to Captain Webber,\r\nthe construction even of a temporary substitute--had the Austrians blown\r\nup the bridge before the Prussians could cross it--would have taken no\r\nless than six weeks. The omission, also, of the Austrians to remove or\r\nto destroy the railway rolling stock they left behind at Prague, on\r\ntheir retirement from that city, conferred a further benefit on the\r\nPrussians. These examples would seem to show that promptness in carrying\r\nout destruction at a critical moment may be no less important on the one\r\nside than efficient organisation on the other for accomplishing the work\r\nof restoration in the shortest possible time.\r\n\r\nWhile the Construction Corps had thus fully justified its existence,\r\nthe sudden creation of such a corps for the purposes of a particular\r\nwar, and for the period of the war only, was considered inadequate for\r\na country where a large standing Army had to be maintained in readiness\r\nfor action at any moment, in case of need. Hence it was thought\r\ndesirable that Prussia should have a Field Railway Section established\r\non a permanent and well-organised footing. There was the further\r\nreason for adopting this course because the Pioneers, composed almost\r\nexclusively of reservists, had received no special training in railway\r\nwork, while the railway men themselves, accustomed to building lines in\r\na solid way for public use, were at a disadvantage when called on to\r\ncarry out, with great rapidity, and in a rough and ready manner, work\r\nthat was wanted only to serve the temporary purposes of the Army with\r\nwhich they were associated.\r\n\r\nIt was found, also, that the corps, comprising so large a civil element,\r\nhad escaped the supervision and control of the Executive Commission\r\nat Berlin which had for its function the regulation of all matters\r\nconcerning military rail-transport. Nor did the Construction _and_\r\nDestruction Corps constitute, as well, an Operation Corps, providing\r\nfor the working of railways at the theatre of war, and especially of\r\nrailways taken from the enemy. The Prussians had, indeed, been able to\r\ncommand the services of Austrian railwaymen in working the railways\r\nseized in that country; but there was no certainty that the adoption of\r\na like expedient would be possible in any future war.\r\n\r\nBy this time the whole subject of the destruction and restoration of\r\nrailway lines as an important element in modern warfare was attracting\r\nattention among military authorities and writers in Germany. A\r\ntranslation of McCallum's report was published, and the issue was begun\r\nof what was to develop into a long series of technical papers, pamphlets\r\nor books--such as, for example, Wilhelm Basson's \"Die Eisenbahnen\r\nim Kriege, nach den Erfahrungen des letzten Feldzuges\" (Ratibor,\r\n1867)--dealing with the art of rapidly destroying and restoring railways\r\nin time of war and the most effective measures to be adopted in the\r\nattainment of either end.\r\n\r\nThese various considerations and developments were, no doubt, the reason\r\nfor the issuing, on August 10, 1869, of a Prussian Royal Decree which\r\ncreated a permanent cadre of _Railway Troops_ to be constituted of\r\nPioneers who were to undergo regular instruction in everything relating\r\nto the construction, destruction and operation of railways. A new\r\nBattalion of Pioneers was to be raised for the purpose, and the whole\r\nscheme was to be carried into effect in the course of 1871.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1870, the war with France broke out, the preparations for\r\nthe creation of this permanent corps were still proceeding; but the\r\nPrussians were, nevertheless, able to enter on the campaign with four\r\nsections of Railway Troops, subsequently increased to six, including one\r\nBavarian section. Each section comprised Engineers, Pioneers, railwaymen\r\nand auxiliary helpers, all of whom wore a uniform having the letter \"E\"\r\n(\"Eisenbahntruppen\") on the shoulder, and carried rifles. Prussia, in\r\nfact, once more started, as in 1866, with such advantage over her enemy\r\nas might result from her control of a Railway Construction Corps. At the\r\noutset France had no similar body, and though, during the progress of\r\nthe war, she hurriedly set about the creation of a Construction Corps\r\nof her own, that corps did not do very much beyond collecting at Metz\r\nand Strasburg a great store of railway materials which was afterwards\r\nto fall into the hands of the Prussians, and assist them in their own\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the advantage thus gained, the practical benefits\r\nsecured by the Germans, although important in their effect on the\r\nfinal issue, were far from being as great as the Army leaders may have\r\nanticipated or desired. The destruction work carried out by the French\r\non their own railways, on their retirement, was much more serious\r\nthan anything experienced in the Prussian campaign in Austria. Thus\r\nthe works for the re-establishment of the Paris-Strasburg line (of\r\nprimary importance to the Germans for the siege of Paris) extended\r\nfrom September 17 to November 22. The French had blocked the tunnel\r\nof Nanteuil by the explosion therein of six mines which brought down\r\nthe walls and filled the western end of the tunnel with about 4,000\r\nsquare yards of sand. Attempts to clear away the obstruction were a\r\nfailure, owing to the occurrence of fresh slips due to the wet weather,\r\nand eventually the Construction Corps built a loop line which avoided\r\nthe tunnel, and so restored communication. The defence of some of the\r\nprincipal lines by fortresses also contributed to the difficulties of\r\nthe invaders; though, on the other hand, these difficulties would have\r\nbeen greater still if the French had always adopted the best and most\r\nscientific methods of interrupting rail communications, as, presumably,\r\nthey would have done if they had had the advantage of a well-organised\r\ncorps prepared in advance for the work that required to be done.\r\n\r\nAt Fontenoy-sur-Moselle, between Nancy and Toul, there was, for example,\r\na bridge of seven arches, effective destruction of which would have made\r\na very serious check in the communications along the principal line\r\nbetween Germany and Paris; but, instead of blowing up the bridge in the\r\nmiddle, the men entrusted with the work (in January, 1871) brought down\r\ntwo arches at the side of the bridge, causing a break which the Germans\r\nwere able to fill in with stones and earth, restoring communication\r\nin about seventeen days. Then, although several of the tunnels in the\r\nVosges mountains were mined, the mines had not been charged, and before\r\ninstructions to blow up the tunnels had been received by those awaiting\r\nthem, the Germans were on the spot and took possession.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the absence on the side of the French of an organised\r\ncorps for destruction as well as construction did not prevent the\r\ncarrying out of some very bold and highly successful work by parties of\r\n_franc tireurs_, who showed alike their appreciation of the importance\r\nof rail communications and their skill in impeding them.\r\n\r\nOne especially striking feat in this direction was accomplished by a\r\ncompany known as the \"Franc Tireurs of the Meuse.\"\r\n\r\nLearning that a Prussian troop train was to pass through Lanois (on\r\nthe line between Reims and Mons) on October 26, 1870, they resolved to\r\neffect its destruction. How they operated is told by Lieutenant Fraser,\r\nR. E.,[25] who arrived on the spot shortly afterwards, and heard the\r\nstory from some of the men engaged on the work.\r\n\r\nAny obstruction placed on the line would have been seen. Hence a\r\ndifferent course had to be adopted. Selecting a spot where the line ran\r\nalong a 12-ft. high embankment, to which a well-wooded slope came down\r\non one side, the _franc tireurs_ took up a pair of rails, removed the\r\nsleepers, cut a deep trench across the line, laid some pieces of iron\r\nat the bottom of the trench, placed on the iron a box containing thirty\r\nkilos (2 qrs. 10 lbs.) of powder, and fixed into the lid of the box a\r\nFrench field shell in such a way that, when the rail was replaced over\r\nthe box, the head of the fuse would be just below the lower flange of\r\nthe rail. In restoring the line again in order that there should be\r\nnothing to attract attention, the _franc tireurs_ omitted one sleeper so\r\nthat the weight of the locomotive should in passing press the rail down\r\non to the head of the fuse. The party--some seventy-five strong--then\r\nwithdrew to the shelter of the woods to await developments.\r\n\r\nIn due time the train of forty coaches approached at the ordinary speed,\r\nthe driver not suspecting any danger. When the engine reached the spot\r\nwhere the \"torpedo\" had been placed, an explosion occurred which tore\r\nup a mass of earth, rails and sleepers, threw the engine and several\r\ncarriages down the embankment, and wrecked the train. Those of the\r\nPrussian troops who got clear from the wreckage were shot down by the\r\n_franc tireurs_ under the protection of their cover. The number of the\r\nenemy thus disposed of was said to be about 400.\r\n\r\nAltogether the French, in their efforts to impede the rail movements of\r\nthe invader, destroyed many miles of line, together with no fewer than\r\nseventy-eight large bridges and tunnels, apart from minor interruptions.\r\nThe repairs and reconstruction thus rendered necessary threw a great\r\namount of labour on the Prussian Railway Troops, and much trouble arose\r\nfrom time to time on account, not only of the inadequate supply of\r\nmaterials even for temporary constructions, but, also, by reason of the\r\nshortcomings of the workers themselves. The sections of Railway Troops\r\nhad been so recently formed that the men were still without adequate\r\ntraining. In 1870-71, as in 1866, military members and civilian members\r\nof the Construction Corps were alike unfamiliar with the special class\r\nof work called for in the repair or the rebuilding of railways under the\r\nemergency conditions of actual warfare. This instruction had, in fact,\r\nto be completed at the theatre of war at a time when the Corps should\r\nhave been prepared to show the greatest efficiency.\r\n\r\nDifficulties arose, also, on the side of the Germans in operating the\r\n2,500 miles of French railway lines of which they took possession.\r\n\r\nThere was, in the first place, a deficiency both of locomotives and of\r\nrolling stock. So far as circumstances would permit, the French, as\r\nthey retreated, either took their railway rolling stock with them or\r\ndestroyed it, in order that it should not be used by the enemy. Attempts\r\nwere made to meet the difficulty by obtaining constant reinforcements\r\nof engines and wagons from Germany; but even then the organisation for\r\ncontrolling the use of rolling stock, among other transport details, was\r\nstill so defective that commanders who wanted to ensure the movement of\r\ntheir own troops by rail did not hesitate to take possession of engines\r\nand carriages set aside for the regular services of the line. There\r\nwere, in fact, occasions when, for this reason, the regular services had\r\nto be stopped altogether.\r\n\r\nIn the next place troubles with the _personnel_ were no less acute\r\nthan those with the _matériel_. In proportion as the Germans advanced\r\ntowards Paris the bulk of the French population retired, while threats\r\nand offers of liberal pay alike failed to secure from those who remained\r\nassistance either in repairing or in operating the lines of which the\r\ninvaders had taken possession. In these circumstances not only engines,\r\ncarriages and wagons, but no fewer than 3,500 railwaymen--in addition\r\nto the German Railway Troops already in France--had to be brought\r\nfrom Germany. Yet even the resort to this expedient started a fresh\r\nlot of troubles. The railwaymen so imported had been in the service\r\nof different German railway companies whose equipment and methods of\r\noperation varied considerably; so that when the men were required to\r\nwork together--and that, also, on the lines of a foreign country, with\r\nthe accompaniment of much laxity in discipline as well as of much mutual\r\nmisunderstanding--a vast amount of friction arose.\r\n\r\nAll these experiences emphasised and strengthened the conclusion arrived\r\nat even before the campaign of 1870-71--that the real efficiency of\r\nRailway Troops can only be obtained by organising them in time of\r\npeace in readiness for times of war. Such conclusion being now beyond\r\nall possible dispute, action was taken by Prussia with characteristic\r\npromptness.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with a Royal Order of May 19, 1871, there was added to the\r\nPrussian Army, on October 1 of the same year, a _Railway Battalion_\r\n(\"Eisenbahnbataillon\"), the special purposes of which were (1) to afford\r\nto those constituting it the means of obtaining, in time of peace,\r\nsuch technical training as would enable them to construct any railway\r\nworks necessary in time of war, to repair promptly any damage done to\r\nrailways, and to undertake the entire railway traffic along lines of\r\ncommunication; (2) to procure, or prepare, in time of peace, all plant,\r\nmaterials, tools, etc., likely to be required in time of war; and (3)\r\nto constitute the nucleus of all necessary railway formations in war.\r\nThe Battalion was formed of non-commissioned officers and men of the now\r\ndisbanded sections of Railway Troops who were still liable to military\r\nservice, supplemented by three-year volunteers and recruits from all\r\nparts of the territory subject to the Prussian Minister of War, only\r\nthose being accepted, however, whose previous occupations fitted them\r\nfor one or other of the various grades of railway work. The officers\r\nwere obtained mainly, though not exclusively, from the Engineers.\r\nMembers of that corps, together with others who were mechanical\r\nengineers by profession, were accepted as one-year volunteers.\r\n\r\nOn a peace footing the Battalion was composed of a Staff and four\r\nCompanies, each of 100 or 125 men, with a depôt, and provided with its\r\nown means of transport. One of the Companies consisted exclusively\r\nof platelayers and watchmen. On mobilisation each Company was to be\r\nenlarged into two Construction Companies and one Traffic Company, giving\r\na total, on a war footing, of eight Construction and four Traffic\r\nCompanies. The Corps also had a reserve division consisting of a Staff,\r\ntwo Companies and a section of railway employés. All officers having\r\nrailway experience who had served in the war of 1870-71 were included in\r\nthe reserve.\r\n\r\nThe training of the Battalion was under the direction of the\r\nInspector-General of the Engineers Corps. It comprised (1) theoretical\r\nand scientific instruction of the officers in all branches of railway\r\nconstruction, repair and destruction, coupled with the study of every\r\nbranch of railway science likely to be of advantage in military\r\ntransport, while special importance was attached to a close and\r\nconstant intercourse with the staffs of the various railways, and\r\n(2) practical experience of railway construction and operation. This\r\nexperience was afforded (_a_) on the Battalion's practice grounds, where\r\ninstruction was more especially given in the art of rapidly destroying\r\nrailway track; (_b_) through the employment of the men--subject to\r\nthe continued maintenance among them of the principle of a military\r\norganisation--on many of the private as well as on the State railways\r\nin Germany, such employment including the repair of bridges, the\r\nlaying of track, the enlargement of stations, etc., and (_c_) by the\r\nconstruction, operation and management of a short line of railway which,\r\non completion, was devoted to the public service. The period of training\r\nwas for either one or three years and the Battalion was kept up to a\r\nnormal standard of about 500 men by a succession of recruits. These\r\nrecruits were generally men of a good type, admission to the Battalion\r\nbeing regarded with the greater favour inasmuch as the experience gained\r\nwas found to be of advantage to the men in obtaining railway employment\r\non their return to civil life.\r\n\r\nIn the giving of this practical instruction the purpose specially\r\nkept in view was that of anticipating as far as possible actual war\r\nconditions, and providing for them accordingly. Thus in the laying of\r\nrails for any new line built by the Railway Troops great importance was\r\nattached to the speed with which the work could be done, the records of\r\nthe time taken being very closely watched.\r\n\r\nTo one group of officers was allocated the duty of studying all\r\ndevelopments in railway science and operation at home or abroad and\r\nconveying information thereon to those under instruction. A further\r\nimportant feature of the scheme included the publication of a series of\r\ntextbooks on railway subjects regarded from a military standpoint. A\r\nbeginning was also made with the collection of large supplies of rails,\r\nbridge materials, etc., for use as required.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1872, Bavaria created a similar Battalion, comprising a\r\nsingle Company attached to the 1st Bavarian Corps. The constitution\r\nand the operations of this Battalion followed closely the precedents\r\nestablished by Prussia.\r\n\r\nSuch was the importance attached by the highest military authorities in\r\nGermany to the formation of these Railway Troops that the Chief of the\r\nGreat General Staff was their Inspector-General from the time of the\r\nfirst Prussian Battalion being created down to the year 1899.\r\n\r\nIn December 30, 1875, came the conversion of the Railway Battalion into\r\na _Railway Regiment_. It was felt that the cadres of the former did\r\nnot respond sufficiently to the needs of the military rail-transport\r\nsituation, and they were accordingly enlarged into a Regiment of two\r\nBattalions, with a regimental Staff of forty-eight, and 502 men in\r\neach Battalion. In 1887 the Prussian Regiment was increased from two\r\nBattalions to four, and the Bavarian Battalion expanded to the extent\r\nof two companies in place of one. In 1890 the Prussian Regiment further\r\nbecame a _Brigade_ of two Regiments, each of two Battalions, the number\r\nof units thus remaining the same as before; though in 1893 the Prussian\r\nBrigade was augmented by two more Battalions, increasing its force to\r\nthree Regiments, each of two Battalions with four Companies in each\r\nBattalion, or a total of twenty-four Companies, of which one was a\r\nWürtemberg Company and two were Saxon Companies, while the Bavarian\r\nBattalion acquired three Companies in the place of two.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 Prussia took a further new departure by grouping together, as\r\n_Communication Troops_ (\"Verkerstrüppen\"), all the technical units\r\nconcerned in the railway, the telegraphic and the air-craft services.\r\nThis new arm was put under the control of an officer holding the rank\r\nof a General of Division and receiving his orders direct from the\r\nEmperor. A change was also effected in regard to the Berlin-Juterbog\r\nrailway--a single-track line, 70 km. (44 miles) in length, which,\r\noriginally constructed mainly by the Railway Troops, was operated by\r\nthem as a means of acquiring experience in railway working. Prior to\r\nthe passing of the law of March 25, 1899, troops for the working staff\r\nwere supplied by the Brigade, and the frequent changes were a cause of\r\nsome inconvenience. Under the new law a section constituted of three\r\nPrussian Companies and a Saxon detachment, with a Lieutenant-Colonel as\r\ndirector, was specially created for the operation of the line.\r\n\r\nAltogether the Railway Troops comprised a total of thirty-one Companies,\r\nhaving 180 officers and 4,500 non-commissioned officers and men; but\r\nthese figures were irrespective of carefully-compiled lists (subjected\r\nto frequent revision) of all reservists possessing railway experience\r\nand still liable for military service. Brigade, Battalions and Companies\r\nthus formed only the cadres of a small army of men considered qualified\r\nto undertake railway work of one kind or another in time of war.\r\n\r\nEven in Germany itself the need for having so large a body of Railway\r\nTroops was called into question some years ago, on the ground, partly,\r\nthat it was desirable to keep to the lowest practicable minimum the\r\nnumber of non-combatants closely associated with the Army; and,\r\npartly, because of the view--favoured by Von der Goltz, in his\r\n\"Kriegführung\"--that much of the construction work which the Railway\r\nTroops would carry out might be left to contractors, without hampering\r\nthe Army with further bodies of new troops for special purposes.\r\n\r\nTo these suggestions it was replied, in effect, (1) that in any future\r\nwar the movement of large bodies of troops would be directly associated\r\nwith the provision and the maintenance of adequate railway facilities;\r\n(2) that Railway Troops, constituted in time of peace, would alone\r\nbe capable of ensuring the rapid renovation of damaged lines, or the\r\nconstruction of new ones, in time of war; (3) that works of this kind,\r\ndone under great pressure, and serving temporary purposes only, would\r\ndiffer essentially from railway works undertaken in peace by ordinary\r\ncontractors; and (4) that Germany required a large body of Railway\r\nTroops on account of her geographical position, inasmuch as she might\r\nhave to face an enemy on either, or both, of two fronts--France and\r\nRussia; while if, in the event of a war with Russia, she should want to\r\nsend her forces into that country by rail, she would require to have\r\na large body of Railway Troops available either for the conversion of\r\nthe Russian 5 ft. gauge into the 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge of the German lines\r\n(in order that the engines and rolling stock of the latter could be\r\nutilised on Russian territory), or for the construction of special\r\nmilitary railways as substitutes for the Russian lines.\r\n\r\nWhatever the merits of these respective arguments, the fact remains\r\nthat the Railway Troops of Germany, created under the circumstances and\r\nconditions here detailed, have been maintained in steadily increasing\r\nnumbers, and, also, in constantly expanding efficiency thanks to what\r\nis, in effect, their School of Railway Instruction and to the great\r\namount of practical work they have been called upon to do, whether in\r\nthe building of strategical lines or in other departments of railway\r\nconstruction, destruction or working in which they could gain experience\r\nlikely to be of advantage in time of war.\r\n\r\nThere was, also, according to M. Paul Lanoir, as related by him in his\r\nbook on \"The German Spy System,\" a still further purpose that these Army\r\nrailwaymen might be called on to serve. He tells how in 1880, the chief\r\nof the system, the notorious Stieber, conceived the idea of securing the\r\nappointment in every portion of the national railway system of France\r\n(and more especially at important junctions or strategical centres) of\r\nGerman spies who, competent to act as railway workers, would, in the\r\nevent of any future war between Germany and France, and on receiving\r\nthe necessary instructions, destroy or block the railway lines at those\r\npoints in such a manner--as planned, of course, in advance--that great\r\ndelay would occur in the mobilisation of the French troops owing to\r\nthe traffic being paralysed for the time being; the Germans, in the\r\nmeantime, rushing their own forces to the frontier. \"The extremely\r\nimportant rôle which would devolve on our railwaymen,\" adds M. Lanoir,\r\n\"at the moment of the declaration of war, in fulfilling their functions\r\nas indispensable auxiliaries to the combatant army, was already\r\nthoroughly appreciated at this period.\"\r\n\r\nSubmitted to Prince Bismarck, Stieber's scheme was approved by him,\r\nand, so far as the obtaining of appointments on the French railways\r\nby Stieber's agents was concerned, the plan had been quietly carried\r\ninto effect by the end of 1883; but a casual incident then led to the\r\ndiscovery of the conspiracy by M. Lanoir himself. Within a week, as the\r\nresult of his communications with General Campenau, Minister of War,\r\nthe railway companies received a confidential circular requiring that\r\nthey should call upon every foreigner employed by them in any capacity\r\nwhatever to become naturalised without delay. Those who would not adopt\r\nthis course were to be immediately dismissed. The number of foreigners\r\nthen in the employ of the railway companies was 1,641, and, although\r\n1,459 of them agreed to become naturalised, there were 182 Germans who\r\nrefused so to do. These 182 were at once discharged--the assumption\r\nbeing that they were the spies, qualified to act as railway workers, by\r\nwhom the dislocation of traffic was to have been ensured whenever they\r\nmight receive word to that effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] Captain A. de Formanoir states in his book, \"Des Chemins de Fer en\r\nTemps de Guerre\" (Conférences militaires belges. Bruxelles, 1870), that\r\nin France and Austria all the railway bridges have mine-chambers so that\r\nthey can be readily destroyed when the occasion arises.\r\n\r\n[25] \"Account of a Torpedo used for the Destruction of a Railway Train\r\non the 26th of October, 1870.\" By Lieut. Fraser, R.E. Papers of the\r\nCorps of Royal Engineers, N.S., Vol. XX. Woolwich, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFRANCE AND THE WAR OF 1870-71\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen France went to war with Germany in 1870-71, her military\r\nrail-transport was still governed by regulations which, adopted as far\r\nback as 1851 and 1855, related only to such matters of detail as the\r\nfinancial arrangements between the Army and the railway companies,\r\nthe length of troop trains, etc., without making any provision for an\r\norganisation controlling the transport of large bodies of men in time\r\nof war. It certainly had been under these regulations that the French\r\ntroops were conveyed to Italy when they took part in the campaign of\r\n1859; but the defects then developed, coupled with the further lessons\r\ntaught by the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, had shown the need for\r\nbringing these early French regulations into harmony with the conditions\r\nand requirements of modern warfare.\r\n\r\nImpressed by these considerations, and realising the disadvantages and\r\ndangers of the position into which his country had drifted, the French\r\nMinister of War, Marshal Niel, appointed in March, 1869, a \"Commission\r\nCentrale des Chemins de Fer,\" composed of representatives of the Army,\r\nthe Ministry of Public Works, and the principal railway companies,\r\nfor the purpose not only of revising the existing regulations on\r\nmilitary transports but of preparing a new one to take their place. The\r\nCommission held twenty-nine sittings and it drew up a provisional scheme\r\non lines closely following those already adopted in Germany and Austria\r\nand based, especially, on the same principle of a co-ordination of the\r\nmilitary with the railway technical element. This provisional scheme\r\nwas subjected to various tests and trials with a view to perfecting\r\nit before it was placed on a permanent basis. But Marshal Niel died;\r\nno new regulation was adopted; the projected scheme was more or less\r\nforgotten; time was against the early completion of the proposed\r\nexperiments, while political and military developments succeeded one\r\nanother with such rapidity that, on the outbreak of war in 1870, it was\r\nno longer possible to carry out the proposed plans. So the studies of\r\nthe Commission came to naught, and France embarked on her tremendous\r\nconflict with no organisation for military transport apart from the\r\nout-of-date and wholly defective regulations under which her troops had\r\nalready suffered in the Italian war of 1859.\r\n\r\nThere was an impression that the talent of the French soldier would\r\nenable him to \"se débrouiller\"--to \"pull,\" if not (in the English sense)\r\nto \"muddle,\" through. But the conditions were hopeless, and the results\r\nspeedily brought about were little short of chaos.\r\n\r\nSo far as the actual conveyance of troops was concerned, the railway\r\ncompanies themselves did marvels. \"The numerical superiority of\r\nGermany,\" as Von der Goltz says in his \"Nation in Arms,\" \"was known in\r\nParis, and it was thought to neutralise this superiority by boldness\r\nand rapidity. The idea was a good one ... but ... it was needful that\r\nthe Germans should be outdone in the rapidity with which the armies\r\nwere massed.\" That the railway managements and staffs did their best to\r\nsecure this result is beyond any possibility of doubt.\r\n\r\nOn July 15, 1870, the Minister of Public Works directed the Est, Nord\r\nand Paris-Lyon Companies to place all their means of transport at the\r\ndisposal of the War Minister, suspending as far as necessary their\r\nordinary passenger and goods services; and the Ouest and Orléans\r\nCompanies were asked to put their rolling stock at the disposal of the\r\nthree other companies. The Est, to which the heaviest part in the work\r\ninvolved was to fall, had already taken various measures in anticipation\r\nof an outbreak of war; and such was the energy shown by the companies,\r\nas a whole, that the first troop train was started from Paris at 5.45\r\np.m. on July 16, within, that is to say, twenty-four hours of the\r\nreceipt of the notice from the Minister of Public Works. Between July 16\r\nand July 26 there were despatched 594 troop trains, conveying 186,620\r\nmen, 32,410 horses, 3,162 guns and road vehicles, and 995 wagon-loads of\r\nammunition and supplies. In the nineteen days of the whole concentration\r\nperiod (July 16-August 4) the companies carried 300,000 men, 64,700\r\nhorses, 6,600 guns and road vehicles, and 4,400 wagon-loads of\r\nammunition and supplies.\r\n\r\nAll this activity on the part of the railway companies was, however,\r\nneutralised more or less by the absence of any adequate organisation for\r\nregulating and otherwise dealing with the traffic, so far as concerned\r\nthe military authorities themselves.\r\n\r\nThe first regiment to leave Paris, on July 16, arrived at the station\r\nat 2 p.m. for the train due to start at 5.45 p.m. The men had been\r\naccompanied through the streets by an immense crowd shouting \"À Berlin!\"\r\nand, with so much time to spare, they either blocked up the station or\r\nwere taken off by their friends to the neighbouring taverns, where the\r\nconsumption of liquor was such that, by the time the train started, most\r\nof the men were excessively drunk. In addition to this, many had been\r\nrelieved of their ammunition--taken from them, perhaps, as \"souvenirs\"\r\nof an historic occasion, though destined to reappear and to be put to\r\nbad use in the days of the Commune, later on.\r\n\r\nIf, however, at the beginning, the troops got to the station three hours\r\nbefore there was any need, other occasions were to arise when they kept\r\ntrains waiting three or four hours before they themselves were ready to\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nThen, in Germany the concentration of the troops at some safe point\r\nin the interior, and their transport thence by rail to the frontier\r\nin complete units, took place as separate and distinct operations. In\r\nFrance the two movements were conducted simultaneously; and this, in\r\nitself, was a prolific source of confusion and disorganisation on the\r\nrailways. The troops came to the stations on a peace footing and in\r\nvarious strengths. One regiment might have only one-third the strength\r\nof another despatched earlier the same day or on the previous day,\r\nalthough the railway company would have provided the same number of\r\nvehicles for both. There was thus a choice of evils as between removing\r\ntwo-thirds of the carriages (a procedure which time or the station\r\narrangements did not always permit); sending the train away only\r\npartially loaded; or filling up the available space either with men\r\nbelonging to other corps or with such supplies as might be available\r\nat the moment. Some trains did leave nearly empty, but it was the\r\nlast mentioned of the three courses that was generally adopted. Men\r\nof different arms--Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery; mobilised troops,\r\nreservists, and individuals, separated, it might be, from their own\r\nofficers and not willing to show themselves amenable to the discipline\r\nof other officers--were thus transported at the same time as, possibly,\r\na miscellaneous collection of horses, material and commissariat\r\nsupplies. Other trains, again, went away so overcrowded that they could\r\nnot accommodate all the men who should have gone by them, many being\r\nleft behind in consequence.\r\n\r\nConfusion and delays at the railway stations during the entraining\r\nof the troops were rendered the more complete because the railway\r\nstaffs failed to get an adequate degree of support from the military\r\nauthorities. According to one of the articles in those regulations of\r\n1855 which were still in force, \"officers were responsible for the\r\nprescribed movements in connection with the entraining, and should\r\npersonally co-operate in ensuring observance of the regulations\r\nreferring thereto\"; but, according to Baron Ernouf, (\"Histoire des\r\nChemins de Fer Français pendant la Guerre Franco-Prussienne,\") there\r\nwere officers who refused absolutely to concern themselves with the\r\nentraining of their men at the Est station in Paris, declaring that this\r\nwas a matter to be looked after by the railway officials with the help\r\nof subordinate officers, if they wanted it.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions as these, officers in charge of troops got\r\nhopelessly separated from their men, who themselves might have been\r\nsent off with no knowledge of their proper destination. One General\r\ntelegraphed to Paris on July 21:--\"Have arrived at Belfort. Not found\r\nmy Brigade. Not found General of Division. What should I do? Don't know\r\nwhere my Regiments are.\" As for the men, it was not many days before\r\nthe stations _en route_ to the front were occupied by a floating mass\r\nof \"lost\" soldiers, who pretended to be looking for their corps but too\r\noften found it much pleasanter to remain in the station buffets, and\r\nthere enjoy the hospitality of local patriots. Such proportions did this\r\nevil assume that in August, 1870, the railway station at Reims had to be\r\nprotected against a mob of from 4,000 to 5,000 \"lost\" ones, who wanted\r\nto plunder the wagons containing supplies for the front.\r\n\r\nConfusion, again, was made still worse confounded by the multiplicity\r\nof orders--too often contradictory or impossible to carry out--which\r\nbombarded the railway officials, and must have driven them at times\r\nalmost to distraction. Orders came direct from anybody and everybody\r\npossessed of the slightest degree of military authority. They came from\r\nthe Ministry of War, the General Staff, and the Administrative Staff;\r\nfrom the Quartermaster-General's Department and the Commissariat; from\r\nofficers and non-commissioned officers of Infantry, Artillery and\r\nEngineers; while each individual invariably gave his orders based on\r\nthe range of his own particular sphere, or the convenience of his own\r\nparticular troops, without any regard for the situation as a whole,\r\nfor what might be wanted in other spheres, or for whether or not it\r\nwas physically possible for the railway staffs to do at all what was\r\nasked of them, even if they were not being overwhelmed with those other\r\norders, besides. Commanding officers of different corps especially\r\ndistinguished themselves by presenting to the railway managements claims\r\nfor priority in the despatch of Infantry, Artillery or supplies, as the\r\ncase might be, threatening them with grave consequences if, in each\r\ninstance, they did not yield such priority at once, though leaving them\r\nto meet an obviously impracticable position as best they could. Then it\r\nmight happen that when all the necessary arrangements--involving much\r\ninterference with other traffic--had been made, another order would come\r\ncountermanding the first one, or postponing the execution of it until a\r\nlater occasion.\r\n\r\nAs though, again, the orders from all these independent military\r\nauthorities were not sufficient, the railways were further worried by\r\nlocal authorities who wanted special trains for some such service as the\r\nconveyance of detachments of garde mobile a distance of ten or twelve\r\nmiles to an instruction camp so that the men would not have to march by\r\nroad. There were even demands from certain of the local authorities that\r\nthey should be allowed to use railway wagons as barracks for troops.\r\n\r\nM. Jacqmin, general manager of the Chemin de Fer de l'Est, relates in\r\nhis book, \"Les Chemins de Fer Pendant la Guerre de 1870-71,\" that at\r\nthe moment when the Compagnie de l'Est was providing for the transport\r\nof Bourbacki's forces, and preparing for the revictualling of Paris,\r\nthe préfet of the Rhone demanded the use of railway wagons in which to\r\nhouse the garde nationale mobilised on the plain of Vénissieux, on the\r\nleft bank of the Rhone, there having been a delay in the delivery of\r\nthe material for barracks. The company refused the request, and they\r\nhad with the departmental authorities a lively controversy which was\r\nonly settled by the decision of the Bordeaux Government that those\r\nauthorities were in the wrong.\r\n\r\nTypical of the general conditions, as they prevailed not only in\r\nParis but elsewhere in France, were the circumstances under which the\r\nNineteenth Army Corps, of 32,000 men, 3,000 horses and 300 guns, was\r\nsent from Cherbourg to Alençon. The troops were late in arriving at the\r\nstation; the officers neglected to look after the men; the men refused\r\nto travel in goods trucks; orders and counter-orders succeeded one\r\nanother in rapid succession; two or three hours were required for the\r\ndespatch of each train, and delays occurred which must have disorganised\r\nthe traffic all along the line.\r\n\r\nGreat as the confusion undoubtedly was at the points of despatch, it\r\nwas far surpassed by that which prevailed at stations to which trains\r\nwere sent regardless of any consideration as to whether or not they\r\ncould be unloaded there with such despatch as to avoid congestion.\r\nNo transfer stations--constituting the points beyond which only the\r\nsupplies wanted for immediate or early use at the extreme front should\r\nbe taken, the remainder being forwarded as wanted--had been arranged,\r\nand the consignors, military or civil, had assumed that all supplies\r\nshould be sent in bulk to places as near to the troops as possible.\r\nThere were, consequently, many stations close to the frontier where the\r\nrails leading to them were occupied for miles together by loaded wagons,\r\nthe number of which was being constantly added to by fresh arrivals.\r\nMany of these wagons were, in fact, used as magazines or storehouses on\r\nwheels. The same was, also, being done to a certain extent on the German\r\nlines, though with this difference--that whereas in Germany there were\r\nat the railway stations route commandants whose duty it was to enforce\r\nthe prompt unloading of wagons, in France there was no corresponding\r\nauthority. It suited the officers or the military department concerned\r\nto keep the supplies in the wagons until they were wanted; and this\r\narrangement may have appeared an especially desirable one from their\r\npoint of view because if the army moved forward--or backward--the\r\nsupplies could be more readily moved with it if they were still in the\r\nwagons.\r\n\r\nFor these various reasons, there were officers who gave the most\r\nstringent orders that the wagons were not to be unloaded until their\r\ncontents were actually required. It was evidently a matter of no concern\r\nto them that the wagons they were detaining might be wanted elsewhere,\r\nand that, for lack of them, other troops might be experiencing a\r\nshortage in their own supplies.\r\n\r\nWhen the wagons were not deliberately kept loaded, it might still be\r\nimpossible for the unloading to be done because of there being no\r\nmilitary in attendance to do the work. As for the picking out, from\r\namong the large number in waiting, of some one wagon the contents of\r\nwhich were specially wanted, the trouble involved in this operation must\r\noften have been far greater than if the wagon had been unloaded and the\r\nsupplies stored in the first instance.\r\n\r\nEven the stations themselves got congested, under like conditions. The\r\nCommissariat wanted to convert them into depôts, and the Artillery\r\nsought to change them into arsenals. There were stations at which no\r\nplatform was any longer available and troops arriving by any further\r\ntrain had to descend some distance away, several days elapsing before\r\ntheir train could be moved from the place where it had pulled up. At\r\nstations not thus blocked trains might be hours late in arriving, or\r\nthey might bring a squadron of cavalry when arrangements had been made\r\nfor receiving a battalion of infantry.\r\n\r\nIn one instance a General refused to allow his men to detrain on arrival\r\nat their destination at night, saying they would be more comfortable\r\nin the carriages than in the snow. This was, indeed, the case; but so\r\nlong as the train remained where it was standing no other traffic could\r\npass. Sometimes it was necessary for troop trains to wait on the lines\r\nfor hours because no camp had been assigned to the men, and there was at\r\nleast one occasion when a Colonel had to ask the stationmaster where it\r\nwas his troops were to go.\r\n\r\nMost of the traffic had been directed to Metz and Strasburg, and the\r\nstate of chaos speedily developed at the former station has become\r\nhistoric.\r\n\r\nThe station at Metz was a large one; it had eight good depôts and four\r\nmiles of sidings, and it was equal to the unloading of 930 wagons in\r\ntwenty-four hours under well-organised conditions. But when the first\r\ninfantry trains arrived the men were kept at the station four or five\r\nhours owing to the absence of orders as to their further destination.\r\nThe men detrained, and the wagons containing road vehicles, officers'\r\nluggage, etc., were left unloaded and sent into the sidings. Other\r\ntrains followed in rapid succession, bringing troops and supplies, and\r\nthe block began to assume serious proportions.\r\n\r\nThe railway officials appealed to the local Commissariat force to unload\r\nthe wagons so that they could be got out of the way. They were told\r\nthat this could not be done because no orders had been received. The\r\nCommissariat force for the division also declined to unload the wagons,\r\nsaying it was uncertain whether the troops for whom the supplies were\r\nintended would remain at Metz or go further on.\r\n\r\nAny unloading at all for several days was next rendered impossible by\r\nthe higher military authorities. They asked the railway officers to\r\nprepare for the transport of an army corps of 30,000 men. This was done,\r\nand forty trains were located at various points along the line. An order\r\nwas then given that the trains should be brought to Metz, to allow of\r\nthe troops leaving at once. Within four hours every train was ready, and\r\nits locomotive was standing with the steam up; but no troops appeared.\r\nThe order was countermanded. Then it was repeated, and then it was\r\ncountermanded over again.\r\n\r\nAll this time fresh train-loads of supplies and ammunition had been\r\narriving at Metz, adding to the collection of unloaded wagons which,\r\nhaving filled up all the sidings began to overflow and block up, first\r\nthe lines leading to the locomotive sheds and next the main lines\r\nthemselves. Everything was in inextricable confusion. Nobody knew where\r\nany particular commodity was to be found or, if they did, how to get\r\nthe truck containing it from the consolidated mass of some thousands of\r\nvehicles. \"In Metz,\" telegraphed the Commissary-General to Paris, \"there\r\nis neither coffee, nor sugar; no rice, no brandy, no salt, only a little\r\nbacon and biscuit. Send me at least a million rations to Thionville.\"\r\nYet it was quite possible that the articles specified were already in\r\nsome or other of the trucks on hand, had the Commissary-General only\r\nknown where they were and how to get them.\r\n\r\nThe railway people did what they could. They unloaded some of the\r\nconsignments and removed them a considerable distance by road--only to\r\nhave them sent back again to Metz station for re-loading and conveyance\r\nelsewhere. Hay unloaded at the station was sent into Metz to some\r\nmagazines which, in turn, and at the same time, were sending hay to\r\nthe railway for another destination. Finally, as a last resource,\r\nand in order both to reduce the block and to get further use out of\r\nthe wagons, the railway officials began to unload them and put their\r\ncontents on the ground alongside. A big capture alike of wagons and of\r\nsupplies was made by the enemy on his occupation of Metz.\r\n\r\nAnalogous conditions prevailed in many other places. At Dôle (Dep. Jura)\r\nan accumulated stock of loaded wagons not only filled up all the sidings\r\nbut blocked up a large portion of the main line. When the evacuation\r\nwas decided on a great waste of time occurred in selecting the wagons\r\nto be moved. Orders given one hour were countermanded the next; trains\r\nwhich had been made up were moved forward and backward, instead of being\r\ngot out of the way at once; and, eventually, a considerable quantity of\r\nrolling stock, which might and should have been removed, had to be left\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nOn the Paris-Lyon railway a collection of 7,500 loaded trucks had\r\naccumulated at a time when a great truck shortage began to be felt,\r\nand the whole of these, together with the provisions and the materials\r\nthey contained, fell into the hands of the Germans, whose total haul\r\nof wagons, including those captured at Metz and other places, numbered\r\nno fewer than 16,000. The wagons thus taken were first used by them\r\nfor their own military transport during the remainder of the war;\r\nwere then utilised for ordinary traffic on lines in Germany, and were\r\neventually returned to France. Not only, therefore, had the French\r\nfailed to get from these 16,000 railway wagons the benefit they should\r\nhave derived from their use but, in blocking their lines with them\r\nunder such conditions that it was impossible to save them from capture,\r\nthey conferred a material advantage on the enemy, providing him with\r\nsupplies, and increasing his own means both of transport and of attack\r\non themselves.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of the German haul of wagons would, probably, have been\r\nlarger still had not some of the French railway companies, on seeing the\r\nadvance the enemy was making, assumed the responsibility of stopping\r\ntraffic on certain of their lines and sending off their rolling stock\r\nto a place of safety. In taking this action they adopted a course\r\nbased alike on precedent and prudence, and one fully warranted by the\r\nprinciple of keeping railway rolling stock designed for purposes of\r\ndefence from being utilised by the enemy for his own purposes of attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nORGANISATION IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile, on the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian war, Germany began,\r\nas we have seen in Chapter X., to improve her own system of military\r\nrail-transport, with a view to remedying the faults developed\r\ntherein, France applied herself with equal, if not with even greater,\r\ndetermination and perseverance to the task of creating for herself a\r\nsystem which, in her case, had been entirely lacking.\r\n\r\nRecognising alike her own shortcomings, the imperative need to prepare\r\nfor future contingencies, and the still more important part that\r\nrailways would inevitably play in the next great war in which she might\r\nbe engaged, France resolved to create, in time of peace, and as an\r\nindispensable factor in her scheme of national defence, a system of\r\nmilitary transport comprehensive in its scope, complete in its working\r\ndetails, and leaving nothing to chance. Everything was to be foreseen,\r\nprovided for, and, as far as circumstances would permit, tested in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian organisation of 1870-71 was, admittedly, and as recommended\r\nby Jacqmin, taken as a starting point for what was to be done. From\r\nthat time, also, every new regulation adopted by Prussia in regard to\r\nmilitary transport, and every important alteration made in the Prussian\r\nsystem, was promptly recorded and commended or criticised in the\r\nably-conducted French military papers; though in the actual creation\r\nof her own system there was no mere following by France of Prussian\r\nexamples. What was considered worth adopting certainly was adopted;\r\nbut the organisation eventually built up, as the result of many years\r\nof pertinacious efforts, was, in reality, based on French conditions,\r\nFrench requirements, and the most progressive ideas of French military\r\nscience. The French were, also, to show that, when they applied\r\nthemselves to the task, they had a genius for organisation in no way\r\ninferior to that of the Germans themselves.\r\n\r\nIn his review of the events of 1870-71, Jacqmin declared that, while\r\nthe education of France in the use of railways in time of war had still\r\nto be completed, the basis for such education had already been laid\r\ndown by Marshal Niel's \"Commission Centrale\" of 1869. The two essential\r\nconditions were (1) unification of control in the use of railways for\r\nmilitary purposes, whether for the transport of men or of supplies; and\r\n(2) association of the military element and the technical element,--an\r\nassociation which should be permanent in its nature and apply to every\r\nphase of the railway service, so that before any order was given there\r\nshould be a guarantee that it was one possible of achievement, and this,\r\nalso, without prejudice to other transport orders already given or\r\nlikely to become necessary.\r\n\r\nIt was these essential conditions that formed the basis of the\r\norganisation which France created.\r\n\r\nAs early as November, 1872, there was called into existence a\r\n_Commission Militaire Superieure des Chemins de Fer_ consisting of\r\ntwelve members, who represented the Ministry of Public Works, the Army,\r\nthe Navy, and the great railway companies. Attached to the Ministry of\r\nWar, and charged with the task of studying all questions relating to\r\nthe use of railways by the Army, the Commission had for its first duty\r\na revision of the proposals made by Marshal Niel's Commission of 1869.\r\nFollowing on this came a succession of laws, decrees and instructions\r\ndealing with various aspects of the situation in regard to military\r\ntransport and the military organization of the railways, the number\r\nissued between 1872 and 1883 being no fewer than seventeen. These,\r\nhowever, represented more or less tentative or sectional efforts made in\r\ncombination with the railway companies, who gave to the Chambers and to\r\nthe administrative authorities their most earnest support and the full\r\nbenefit of all their technical knowledge and experience in regard to\r\nthe many problems which had to be solved.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 there were issued two decrees (July 7 and October 29) which\r\ncodified, modified or further developed the various legislative\r\nor administrative measures already taken, and laid down both the\r\nfundamental principles and the leading details of a comprehensive\r\nscheme which, after additional modifications or amendments, based on\r\nlater experiences, was to develop into the system of organised military\r\nrail-transport as it exists in France to-day.\r\n\r\nThese later modifications were more especially effected by three\r\ndecrees which, based on the law of December 28, 1888, dealt with (1)\r\nthe composition and powers of the Commission Militaire Superieure des\r\nChemins de Fer; (2) the creation of Field Railway Sections and Railway\r\nTroops; and (3) the organisation of the military service of railways.\r\n\r\nSince its original formation in 1872, the _Superior Military Commission_\r\nhad already undergone reconstruction in 1886, and still further changes,\r\nin addition to those made by the decree of February 5, 1889, were to\r\nfollow. In its final form the Commission still retains the principle of\r\nrepresentation thereon alike of the military and the technical (railway)\r\nelement. Presided over by the Chief of the General Staff--who, with\r\nthe help of a special department of that Staff, exercises the supreme\r\ndirection of the military transport services, subject to the authority\r\nof the War Minister--the Commission is composed of six Generals or other\r\nmilitary officers of high rank, three representatives of the Ministry of\r\nPublic Works, and the members of the Line Commission appointed for each\r\nof the great railway systems and, also, for the Chemin de Fer d'État.\r\n\r\nAll the members of the Commission are nominated by the Minister of\r\nWar. The function they discharge is a purely consultative one. Their\r\nbusiness it is to give to the Minister their views on all such questions\r\nas he may submit to them for consideration in regard to the use of the\r\nrailways by the Army, and more especially in regard to--\r\n\r\n1. Preparations for military transports.\r\n\r\n2. Examination of all projects for new lines or junctions and\r\nalterations of existing lines, as well as all projects which concern\r\nrailway facilities (stations, platforms, water supply, locomotive sheds,\r\netc.)\r\n\r\n3. The fixing of the conditions to be fulfilled by railway rolling stock\r\nin view of military requirements, and the alterations which may be\r\nnecessary to adapt it thereto.\r\n\r\n4. Special instructions to be given to troops of all arms as to their\r\ntravelling by rail.\r\n\r\n5. Agreements to be made between railway companies and the War\r\nDepartment in respect to transport of troops, provisions, etc.\r\n\r\n6. Organisation, instruction and employment of special corps of\r\nrailwaymen (for repairs, etc.).\r\n\r\n7. Measures to be taken for ensuring the supervision and protection of\r\nrailways and their approaches.\r\n\r\n8. The means of destroying and of rapidly repairing lines of railway.\r\n\r\nHeads of the different services at the Ministry of War can attend\r\nmeetings of the Commission, in a consultative capacity, in respect to\r\nmatters coming within their jurisdiction, and the Commission can, in\r\nturn, apply to the Minister for the attendance of any person it may\r\ndesire to hear.\r\n\r\nAs far as possible, all plans and arrangements concerning the transport\r\nof troops and supplies in time of war, from the moment of mobilisation\r\nonward, are thus prepared, examined or provided for in advance. In\r\narticle 8 of the Regulation of December 8, 1913, on Military Transports\r\nby Railway (\"Réglement sur les transports stratégiques par chemin de\r\nfer\") it is, in fact, stated that--\r\n\r\n    All the arrangements relating to the organisation and\r\n    carrying out of transport for mobilisation, concentration,\r\n    revictualling and evacuation are studied and prepared in time\r\n    of peace. The Minister gives, to this effect, all the necessary\r\n    instructions to the General Staff, to the commanders of Army\r\n    Corps, and to the different services. A like course is adopted,\r\n    in time of peace, with regard to the study of the conditions\r\n    under which the railways will be operated on the lines of\r\n    communication.\r\n\r\nThe creation, under the law of March 13, 1875, of Field Railway Sections\r\nand Railway Troops was the outcome of the obvious need of having an\r\norganised force able to take up the duties of constructing, repairing,\r\ndestroying or operating railways at the theatre of war, such force being\r\nestablished in time of peace and assured all the experience needed to\r\nqualify them for the discharge of those various duties. France, in fact,\r\nwas now, in this respect, to follow the example of Germany, just as\r\nGermany had already been inspired by the example of the United States.\r\n\r\nUnder a decree of February 5, 1889, _Field Railway Sections_ (\"Sections\r\nde chemins de fer de campagne\") were defined as permanent military corps\r\ncharged, in time of war, and concurrently with the Railway Troops,\r\nwith the construction, renovation and operation of those railways of\r\nwhich the working could not be assured by the national companies. Their\r\npersonnel was to be recruited from among the engineers, officials\r\nand men employed by the railway companies and by the State Railways\r\nAdministration, such recruiting being carried out either voluntarily\r\nor by reason of liability to render military service; and they were to\r\nform a distinct corps, having its own governing body with, as its head,\r\na commandant exercising the functions of a Chef de Corps. In time of\r\npeace there were to be nine sections, each designated by a distinctive\r\nnumber according to the particular railway system or systems from which\r\nit was formed; though authority was given to the Minister of War to call\r\nfurther sections into being in case of war. The number in peace was\r\nincreased, in 1906, by the formation of a tenth section from among the\r\nstaffs of railways in the \"secondary\" group, including local lines and\r\ntramways, in order to assure, or to assist in, the operation of these\r\nrailways or tramways for military transport in time of war.\r\n\r\nIn time of peace the sections were to be subject to inspections,\r\nmusters, reviews and assemblies, as ordered by the Minister of War. A\r\nfurther provision in the decree of 1889 says:--\"All the arrangements\r\nrelative to the mobilisation of each section shall be studied and\r\nplanned in time of peace. Each section should always be ready, in the\r\nmost complete manner, to render its services to the Minister of War.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequent decrees or instructions constituted each of the sections a\r\ncomplete unit on the following basis: (1) A central body; (2) three\r\ndistinct divisions, namely, (_a_) \"movement,\" (_b_) \"voie,\" and (_c_)\r\n\"traction\"; (3) a central depôt common to the three divisions and the\r\ncentral body; and (4) complementary territorial subdivisions in the same\r\nthree classes, and attached to the central depôt of the section. The\r\nterritorial subdivisions are designed to provide a reserve force of men\r\nwho can complete or strengthen the existing sections, or, alternatively,\r\nbe constituted into additional sections, if so desired by the Minister\r\nof War. The total strength of each section (including 141 allotted to\r\nthe central depôt) was fixed as 1,466.\r\n\r\nThe administration of a section rests with an Administrative Council\r\nformed by the president and the heads of the several departments, and\r\nmeeting at least once in every three months in time of peace, and once\r\na week in time of war. Authority is exercised over the sections by the\r\nField Railway Commissions to which they are attached.[26]\r\n\r\nMen in the active divisions of the sections who are liable to military\r\nservice are excused from taking part in the ordinary military exercises,\r\nbut may be assembled for inspections, etc., or to undergo courses of\r\ninstruction in railway work. Men in the territorial subdivisions can be\r\nsummoned by the Minister of War for \"a period of exercises\" in railway\r\nwork in time of peace; and the fact may be recalled that advantage of\r\nthis power was taken during the French railway troubles of 1910, when\r\nthe strikers were required to assume the rôle of soldiers doing railway\r\nwork under military authority and control.\r\n\r\nThe _Railway Troops_ (\"Troupes de chemin de fer\") now constitute a\r\nRailway Regiment (\"5e régiment du génie\") organised under the decree\r\nof July 11, 1899, and comprising on a peace footing, three Battalions,\r\neach of four Companies.\r\n\r\nRecruits for the Railway Regiment come from one or other of the\r\nfollowing classes: (1) Young soldiers who were in the railway service\r\nbefore they joined the Army; (2) an annual contingent of railway\r\nemployés selected by the Minister of War from lists supplied for this\r\npurpose by the administrations of the five great railway companies\r\nand of the State railways, the number so selected not to exceed 240,\r\ndistributed as follows: Compagnie du Nord, 42; Est, 18; P. L. M., 54;\r\nOrléans, 42; Midi, 15; État, 69; and (3) soldiers belonging to Infantry\r\nRegiments who, after one year of training therein, are sent to the\r\nRailway Regiment, those chosen for this purpose being, by preference,\r\nmen whose previous occupation in life has adapted them for railway work.\r\n\r\nThe railway administrations are also required to provide from among\r\ntheir officials a certain number of officers and non-commissioned\r\nofficers to form a reserve for the Regiment.\r\n\r\nA most complete and systematic course of instruction is arranged.[27] It\r\nis divided into (1) military instruction and (2) technical instruction,\r\nthe purpose of the latter being defined as that of qualifying the\r\nRailway Troops to undertake at the theatre of war, subject to the\r\nauthority of the Director-General of Railways and Communications,\r\nworks of repair or destruction of railway lines, or, in case of need,\r\nthe provisional working of the railways. In time of peace it is the\r\nduty of the Superior Military Commission for Railways to advise on all\r\nquestions concerning the organisation, instruction and employment of the\r\nspecial troops for railway work. To enable it to discharge this function\r\nthe Commission receives, through the Chief of the General Staff, all\r\nprogrammes, proposals or reports that may be issued in regard to the\r\ntechnical instruction of the troops, giving its views thereon, and\r\nmaking such recommendations as it may consider desirable.\r\n\r\nSuch technical instruction comprises (_a_) that which is given to the\r\nwhole of the troops; (_b_) instruction in particular branches of railway\r\nwork given to a limited number of individuals; (_c_) instruction to\r\ngroups of men operating in companies or otherwise, and (_d_) instruction\r\nobtained on the ordinary railways. It is further divided into (i)\r\ntheoretical and (ii) practical.\r\n\r\nAmong the measures adopted for ensuring the success of the general\r\nscheme, mention might be made of the issuing of special series of\r\ntextbooks; the regular working by the Regiment of about forty miles of\r\nrailway--including an important junction--between Chartres and Orléans,\r\non the State Railway system; and arrangements made with the railway\r\nadministrations under which (1) a certain number of Companies belonging\r\nto the Regiment are attached to the ordinary railway systems every\r\nyear, for periods of two or three months; and (2) power is given to the\r\nrailway administrations to engage the services of the Railway Troops\r\nin carrying out repairs or construction works on their lines, a mutual\r\nadvantage thus being obtained.\r\n\r\nFinally there is a Railway School (\"École de chemins de fer\") which\r\nhas charge of all the materials, tools, etc., used in the technical\r\ninstruction of the troops; draws up, under the orders of the Colonel,\r\nprogrammes of practical work and instruction; and provides (1) a library\r\nwhich is supplied with books and periodicals dealing with military,\r\nrailway, scientific and historical subjects, together with maps,\r\nplans, decrees, regulations, etc., relating to the military operation\r\nof railways; (2) a collection of tools, instruments and models; (3)\r\nphotographic and lithographic departments; (4) stores of railway\r\nconstruction material for instruction purposes; (5) other stores of like\r\nmaterial for use in case of war; (6) workshops for practical instruction\r\nin railway repairs, etc.; and (7) practice grounds reserved exclusively\r\nfor the Railway Troops.\r\n\r\nThe fact of these two bodies of Field Railway Sections and Railway\r\nTroops being organised on so practical and comprehensive a basis\r\nsecured to France the control of forces certain to be of the greatest\r\nservice to her in the next war in which she might be engaged. It would,\r\nalso, even suffice by itself to prove the earnestness, the vigour and\r\nthe thoroughness with which, after 1870-71, France entered upon the\r\nimprovement of her system of military rail-transport for national\r\ndefence. There was, however, much more to be done, besides, before that\r\nsystem could be considered complete; and here, again, a vast amount of\r\nstudy, foresight and energy was shown.\r\n\r\nFollowing, indeed, the laws, decrees, regulations, orders, and\r\ninstructions issued down to 1889 came so many others--dealing, in some\r\ninstances, with even the minutest detail concerning some particular\r\nphase of the organisation in course of being perfected--that a collected\r\nseries of those still in force in 1902 formed a volume of over 700\r\npages.[28] Since the issue of this somewhat formidable collection, still\r\nfurther changes have been introduced, the general conditions being\r\nfinally modified by decrees passed on December 8, 1913.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to indicate all the successive stages in this\r\nprolonged series of legislative and administrative efforts, it may\r\nsuffice to offer a general sketch of the French organisation of military\r\nrail-transport on the basis of the laws, regulations and practices in\r\noperation on the outbreak of war in 1914.\r\n\r\nConnected with each of the great railway systems there is a permanent\r\n_Line Commission_ (\"Commission de réseau\") which consists of (1) a\r\ntechnical member who, in practice, is the general manager of the line;\r\nand (2) a military member, who is a member of the General Staff of the\r\nArmy. The former is chosen by the railway administration, subject to\r\nthe approval of the War Minister, and the latter by the War Minister\r\nhimself. Each Line Commission controls the services of a combined\r\ntechnical and military staff, and each Commissioner has a deputy who\r\ncan take his place and exercise his powers in case of need. While the\r\nMilitary Commissioner is specially responsible for measures adopted\r\nfrom a military point of view, the Railway Commissioner is specially\r\nresponsible for putting at the command of the Army, as far as may be\r\nnecessary or practicable, all the resources of the particular railway\r\nsystem he represents.\r\n\r\nThe authority of a Line Commission on any one of the great railway\r\nsystems extends to the smaller, or secondary, lines situate within the\r\nsame territory; but the smaller companies may themselves claim to be\r\nrepresented on the Commission by a duly credited agent.\r\n\r\nAmong the duties to be discharged by a Line Commission in time of peace\r\nare the following:--\r\n\r\n1. Investigation of all matters to which military transport on the line\r\nor the system can give rise.\r\n\r\n2. Study of all the available resources of the system, in material and\r\nmen, from the point of view of military requirements.\r\n\r\n3. Preparation of plans, estimates, and other data in connection with\r\nthe movement of troops, etc.\r\n\r\n4. Verification of reports concerning extent of lines, rolling stock,\r\nand station or traffic facilities.\r\n\r\n5. Special instruction of the railway staff.\r\n\r\n6. Inspection of lines, bridges, etc.\r\n\r\n7. The carrying out of experiments of all kinds with a view to\r\nameliorating or accelerating the facilities offered by the system in\r\nrespect to military transports.\r\n\r\nShould several Line Commissions be interested in some particular\r\nquestion concerning military movements by rail, the Chief of the\r\nGeneral Staff can summon them to a joint conference as often as may be\r\nnecessary. The fact, also, that the members of the Line Commissions are\r\nmembers of the Superior Commission assures co-ordination in the studies\r\ncarried on as regards the railways in general, and provides a ready\r\nmeans by which the central body can obtain the information it desires\r\nconcerning any one system or group of systems.\r\n\r\nAs their district executives, the Line Commissions have such number of\r\n_Sub-Line Commissions_ as may be found necessary. Each of these is,\r\nin turn, composed of a military member, nominated by the Minister,\r\nand a technical member, chosen by the Line Commission. Then, also, to\r\ndischarge the function of local executive, there is at every important\r\ncentre of traffic a _Station Commission_ (\"Commission de gare\") which\r\nconsists of a military officer and the stationmaster. It receives from\r\nthe Line or Sub-Line Commission all orders or instructions concerning\r\nmilitary transport to, from, or passing through, such station, and is\r\nthe recognised intermediary for carrying them into effect and seeing\r\nthat efficiency is ensured and good order maintained.\r\n\r\nA staff, formed of military men and railwaymen acting in combination,\r\nis allotted to each Line, Sub-Line or Station Commission. Concerning\r\nthe representation of these two elements, military and civil, on the\r\none body, article 10 of the decree of December 8, 1913, on Military\r\nTransports says:--\r\n\r\n    The special function of each of the agents, military or\r\n    technical, on the Commissions or Sub-Commissions must, in the\r\n    operation of the service, be maintained in the most absolute\r\n    manner. At the same time these agents should not lose from their\r\n    view the fact that their association is designed to effect\r\n    harmony between the exigencies alike of military requirements\r\n    and of rail transport, subordinating those of the one to those\r\n    of the other, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that mobilisation begins--or even earlier, on the order\r\nof the War Minister--the members of the Superior Commission take up\r\ntheir posts _en permanence_ at the War Office, and those of the Line,\r\nSub-Line and Station Commissions locate themselves at the stations\r\nwhich will have been allotted to them in time of peace. Thenceforward\r\neach Station Commission is in constant communication by telegraph with\r\nthe Line or Sub-Line Commission under which it acts, supplementing\r\nsuch communication by daily written reports. Among the duties to be\r\ndischarged by the Station Commissions are those of superintending the\r\nentrainment or detrainment of troops and the loading or unloading\r\nof material; seeing that the trains required for transport purposes\r\nare provided; preventing congestion of the lines or of the station\r\napproaches; and ensuring the security of the station and of the lines\r\nwithin a certain radius thereof.\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of war the railway companies must place at the service\r\nof the State either the whole or such of their lines, rolling stock, and\r\nother means of transport as may be needed for the conveyance of troops,\r\nstores, etc., to any points served by them. Thenceforward the lines so\r\nrequired for \"strategic transports\"--including therein mobilisation,\r\nconcentration, reinforcements, supplies and evacuations from the theatre\r\nof war--can be used for ordinary passengers and goods only to such\r\nextent as the Minister may approve.\r\n\r\nFollowing on the order for mobilisation the Minister, after consultation\r\nwith the Commander-in-Chief, divides the railways of the country into\r\ntwo zones--the \"Zone of the Interior,\" and the \"Zone of the Armies.\" Of\r\nthese the former passes under the supreme control of the War Minister,\r\nand the latter under that of the Commander-in-Chief. The location of\r\nthe _Stations of Transition_, dividing the one zone from the other,\r\ncan be varied from time to time by the Minister, in consultation with\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, according to the developments of the military\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe _Zone of the Interior_ is that part of the railway system which,\r\nthough not situated at the theatre of war, is subject to military\r\ncontrol by reason of the services required of it in the forwarding of\r\ntroops, supplies, guns, ammunition and other necessaries. Operation\r\nby the ordinary staffs of the railway systems is continued, but the\r\ntransports ordered by the War Minister are regulated by the Chief of the\r\nGeneral Staff. The execution of the orders given is entrusted from the\r\nday of mobilisation to the Line Commissions, each of which, acting under\r\nthe authority of the War Minister, takes charge over the whole of the\r\nservices on the lines comprised in its particular territory.\r\n\r\nThe _Zone of the Armies_ is, in turn, divided into two sections (1)\r\nthe \"Zone de l'avant,\" in which military operation of the railways is\r\nnecessary on account of their nearness to the fighting-line; and (2)\r\nthe \"Zone de l'Arrière,\" in which the railways can still be operated by\r\nthe ordinary railway staffs, under the direction of Line and Station\r\nCommissions, as in the adjoining Zone of the Interior.\r\n\r\nOrders given by the Commander-in-Chief in respect to transport in the\r\nZone of the Armies are carried out under the supreme control of an\r\nofficer now known as the _Directeur de l'Arrière_. The history of this\r\nimportant functionary affords an excellent example of the way in which\r\nthe whole scheme of operations has been evolved.\r\n\r\nThe \"Règlement général\" of July 1, 1874,--one of the earliest attempts\r\nto meet the difficulties which had arisen in 1870-71 in respect to\r\nmilitary rail-transport--was found to be defective inasmuch as it\r\ndid not apply, also, to those road and rear services (\"Services de\r\nl'Arrière\") which are necessarily associated with the rail services\r\nand themselves constitute so important a phase of military transport\r\nas a whole. In 1878 an attempt was made to meet this defect by the\r\ninauguration of a system of \"Services des Étapes\"; but here, again,\r\nthe existence of separate organisations for rail service and road\r\nservice, without any connecting and controlling link, was found to be\r\nunsatisfactory. In 1883 a Commission, presided over by General Fay,\r\nwas appointed to consider what would be the best course to adopt, and,\r\nin the result, there was issued, on July 7, 1884, a Decree creating\r\na \"Directeur Général des Chemins de Fer et des Étapes,\" whose duties\r\nwere more clearly defined under a Decree of February 21, 1900. In\r\n1908 the title of this officer was changed to that of \"Directeur de\r\nl'Arrière,\" and, after further revisions, the scope of his authority and\r\nresponsibility was eventually fixed by the Regulation of December 8,\r\n1913.\r\n\r\nTaking up his position at the head-quarters of the Commander-in-Chief,\r\nand keeping in close touch, also, with the Minister of War through the\r\nChief of the General Staff, the Directeur de l'Arrière has for his\r\nspecial function that of securing complete co-ordination alike between\r\nrail services and road services and between the services in the Zone of\r\nthe Interior and those in the Zone of the Armies. Both from the Minister\r\nand from the Commander-in-Chief he receives information as to operations\r\nprojected or in progress, and as to the needs of the armies in\r\n_personnel_ and _matériel_. His business it is to see that these needs,\r\naccording to their order of urgency--as further communicated to him--are\r\nsupplied under conditions which shall provide for all contingencies\r\nand guard against all possible confusion or delays. He fixes, among\r\nother things, the lines of communication; he keeps in close touch with\r\nthe road services, and--having, within the limit of his instructions,\r\ncomplete control over the railways in the Zone of the Armies--he decides\r\non the conditions to be adopted in respect to all transport alike\r\nfrom the interior to the armies and from the armies to the interior.\r\nAs between, also, the Minister of War and the Commander-in-Chief, he\r\nmaintains a constant exchange of information concerning time-tables for\r\nmilitary trains and other such matters.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of these duties the Directeur de l'Arrière is aided by\r\na staff which comprises both the technical and the military elements;\r\nbut he is not himself responsible for the actual working of either the\r\nrail or the road services.\r\n\r\nRailway services in the Zone of the Armies are--subject to the supreme\r\nauthority of the Directeur de l'Arrière--under the control of a\r\n_Director of Railways_ who is assisted by (1) a combined military and\r\ntechnical staff; (2) a Line Commission for that section of the zone\r\nwhere the railways can still be worked by their ordinary staffs; and (3)\r\none or more _Field Line Commissions_ (\"Commissions de chemins de fer de\r\ncampagne\"), together with Railway Troops, for the section where military\r\noperation is necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of that co-ordination to which so much importance is\r\nrightly attached, the Director of Railways refers to the Directeur\r\nde l'Arrière all demands for transport that concern the railways of\r\nboth the Zone of the Interior and the Zone of the Armies or involve\r\nconveyance by road as well as by rail. He also passes on to the\r\nCommissions in charge of either section of the railways included in the\r\nZone of the Armies the orders he himself receives from the Directeur de\r\nl'Arrière in respect to such transport requirements as may concern them.\r\nTime-tables drawn up, and other arrangements made, by these Commissions\r\nare subject to his approval. He further decides as to the distribution,\r\nwithin the Zone of the Armies, of the rolling stock and the railway\r\npersonnel placed at his disposal by the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nThe _Field Line Commissions_ are the executive agents of the Director\r\nof Railways in the discharge of the various duties assigned to him. The\r\nnumber of these Commissions is decided by the Directeur de l'Arrière,\r\nand the date of their entering on their functions is fixed by the\r\nDirector of Railways. Each Commission consists of a staff officer and\r\na railway engineer. Of these the former is military president of the\r\nCommission and has the controlling voice. When he considers it necessary\r\nthat he should accept, in addition to his own responsibility, that of\r\nthe technical commissioner, the latter must defer to his views and\r\nto the orders he gives. The president has an assistant--also a staff\r\nofficer--who can replace him when necessary, while the Commission has\r\na staff of secretaries and orderlies as approved by the Minister of\r\nWar. The personnel of the Commissions includes Railway Troops (\"Sapeurs\r\nde chemins de fer\" and \"Sections de chemins de fer de campagne\"); a\r\ntelegraphy staff; Station Commissions; and \"gendarmerie\" to undertake\r\npolice duties in the stations and on the trains.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making traffic arrangements and undertaking the operation\r\nof those lines at the theatre of war that may pass under full military\r\ncontrol, the Field Line Commissions are required to carry out such\r\nconstruction, repair, maintenance or destruction work on the railways as\r\nshould be found necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the _Lines of Communication_ passing through the two zones and\r\nensuring direct communication between the interior and such accessible\r\npoints on the railway as may, from time to time, be nearest to the\r\narmies in the field, the leading stations _en route_ are required to\r\nserve a variety of military purposes; though in each and every such\r\ninstance the system of organisation is such that the duties to be\r\ndischarged or the responsibilities to be fulfilled are undertaken by,\r\nor are under the control of, a Commission formed on the now established\r\nbasis of representation thereon of both the military and the technical\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nFor the conveyance of troops, there are, in the first place,\r\n_Mobilisation Stations_ and _Junction Stations_, whence the men\r\nwithin a certain district are sent to the _Embarkation Stations_, at\r\nwhich complete units for the front are made up. These are followed by\r\n_Stations for Meals_ (\"Stations haltes-repas\"), for men and horses;\r\nthough in this case the \"stations\" may really be goods or locomotive\r\nsheds, able to accommodate a large number of men. At the end of the\r\nrailway line, so far as it is available for troops, come the _Detraining\r\nStations_.\r\n\r\nIn regard to supplies and stores, the first link in the chain of\r\norganisation is constituted by the _Base Supply Stations_ (\"gares de\r\nrassemblement\"). Here the supplies going from a certain district outside\r\nthe theatre of operations to any one Army Corps must be delivered; and\r\nhere they are checked, made up into full train loads, or otherwise dealt\r\nwith in such a way as to simplify and facilitate their further transport.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases full train-loads arriving at these assembling stations\r\npass through to destination, after being checked; but the general\r\npractice is for the consignments forwarded from base supply stations to\r\ngo to the _Supply Depôts_ (\"Stations-magasins\"), serving the purposes\r\nof storehouses from which supplies, whether received from the base or\r\ncollected locally, can be despatched in just such quantities, and at\r\njust such intervals, as circumstances may require. These depôts are\r\norganised on a different basis according to the particular service or\r\npurpose for which they are designed,--Cavalry, Engineers, Artillery,\r\nMedical, Telegraph Corps; provisions, live stock, clothing, camp\r\nequipment, etc. Their number, character, and location are decided by\r\nthe Minister of War in time of peace. On the outbreak of war those in\r\nthe Zone of the Armies pass under the control of the Commander-in-Chief\r\ntogether with the railway lines within that zone. The situation of\r\nthe depôts may be changed, or additional depôts may be opened, by the\r\nDirecteur de l'Arrière, with the consent of the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nEach station depôt is under the charge of the military member of the\r\nStation Commission. His special function it is to supply therefrom the\r\nwants of the Army in accordance with the demands he receives. These\r\ndemands he distributes among the different departments of the depôt,\r\ngiving instructions as to the time by which the railway wagons must\r\nbe loaded. He also takes, with the stationmaster, all the necessary\r\nmeasures for ensuring the making up, the loading, and the departure of\r\nthe trains; but he must not interfere with the internal administration\r\nof the station or with the technical direction and execution of the\r\nrailway services.\r\n\r\nProvision is also made for the immediate unloading of trains bringing\r\nsupplies to the station depôts for storage there, the military\r\ncommissioner being expressly instructed to guard against any block on\r\nthe lines in or near to the station. Wagons need not be unloaded if\r\nthey are to be sent on after only a brief detention, or if they contain\r\nammunition forming part of the current needs of the Army.\r\n\r\nFrom the supply depôts the supplies and stores pass on to the\r\n_Regulating Station_ (\"gare régulatrice\"). This is located at such point\r\non each line of communication as, while allowing of a final regulation\r\nof supplies going to the front, does not--owing to its nearness to the\r\nfighting line--permit of any guarantee of a fixed train service beyond\r\nthat point. The locality of the regulating station is changed from day\r\nto day, or from time to time, according to developments in the military\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe regulating station is in charge of a _Regulating Commission_\r\n(\"Commission régulatrice\"), constituted on the same basis as a Sub-Line\r\nCommission. Receiving orders or instructions as to the nature and\r\nquantities of the supplies and stores required by the troops at the\r\nfront, and drawing these from the supply depôts, the Commission must\r\nalways have on hand a sufficiency to meet requirements. It is, also,\r\nleft to the Commission to arrange for the further despatch of the\r\nsupplies from the regulating station by means of such trains as, in the\r\ncircumstances of the moment, may be found practicable.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of daily routine, and without further instructions, the\r\nsupply depôts send one train of provisions each day to the regulating\r\nstation, and the latter sends on one train daily to the front, always,\r\nhowever, keeping a further day's supply on hand, at or near the\r\nregulating station, to meet further possible requirements. Additional\r\ntrains, whether from the supply depôts or from the regulating station\r\n(where rolling stock is kept available) are made up as needed.\r\n\r\nSupplementing these arrangements, the Regulating Commission may, at\r\nthe request of the Director of Road Services, further keep permanently\r\nwithin its zone of action a certain number of wagons of provisions in\r\nreadiness to meet contingencies, the wagons so utilised as _Stores\r\non wheels_ being known as \"en-cas mobiles.\" Should the Directeur de\r\nl'Arrière so desire, railway wagons with ammunition can, in the same\r\nway, be kept loaded at any station within the Zone of the Armies, or,\r\nby arrangement with the Minister of War, in the Zone of the Interior.\r\nIt is, however, stipulated that the number of these wagons should\r\nbe reduced to a minimum, in order to avoid congestion either of the\r\nstations or of the railway lines.\r\n\r\nBeyond the regulating station comes _Railhead_, which constitutes the\r\nfurthest limit of possible rail-transport for the time being, and\r\nthe final point of connection between rail and road services, the\r\nlatter being left with the responsibility of continuing the line of\r\ncommunication thence to the armies on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the Regulating Commission, as soon as it enters on the\r\ndischarge of its functions and as often afterwards as may be necessary,\r\nto advise both the General in command of the Army served by the line\r\nof communication and the Director of Road Services as to the station\r\nwhich can be used as railhead and the facilities offered there for the\r\naccommodation, unloading, and loading of wagons. On the basis of the\r\ninformation so given the General-in-Command decides each day, or as the\r\noccasion requires, on the particular station which shall be regarded\r\nas railhead for the purposes of transport. He advises the Regulating\r\nCommission and the Director of Road Services accordingly, and he\r\nfurther notifies to them his wishes in regard to the forwarding of\r\nsupplies to the point thus fixed.\r\n\r\nThese elaborate arrangements for ensuring a maintenance of efficiency\r\nalong the whole line of communication from the interior to the front\r\nequally apply to transport of all kinds from the theatre of war to the\r\ninterior. In principle, evacuations from the army of sick and wounded,\r\nprisoners, surplus stores, and so on, are effected from railhead by\r\nmeans of the daily supply-trains returning thence to the regulating\r\nstation, where the Regulating Commission takes them in charge, and\r\npasses them on by the trains going back to the Depôt Stations, or\r\nbeyond. Should special trains be necessary for the removal of a\r\nlarge number of wounded, or otherwise, the Director of Road Services\r\ncommunicates with the Regulating Commission, which either makes up the\r\ndesired specials from the rolling stock it has on hand or, if it cannot\r\ndo this, itself applies, in turn, to the Director of Railways.\r\n\r\nFor dealing with the sick and wounded, every possible provision is made\r\nunder the authority of the Minister of War and the Director-General,\r\nthe arrangements in advance, as detailed in the decrees relating to\r\nthis branch of the subject, being on the most comprehensive scale.\r\nAmong other measures provided for is the setting up of _Evacuation\r\nHospitals_ (\"hôpitaux d'évacuation\") in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nthe Regulating Stations, if not, also, at railhead. Elsewhere along\r\nthe line certain stations become _Infirmary Stations_, (\"infirmaries\r\nde gare\") where, in urgent cases, and under conditions laid down by\r\nthe War Minister, the sick and wounded _en route_ to the interior can\r\nreceive prompt medical attention in case of need. From the _Distribution\r\nStations_ (\"gares de répartition\"), the sick and wounded are sent to the\r\nhospitals in the interior to which they may be assigned.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this comprehensive scheme of organisation aims at\r\npreventing the recurrence of any of those defects or deficiencies which\r\ncharacterised the military rail-transport movements of France in the war\r\nof 1870-71.\r\n\r\nThe presence, at every important link in the chain of rail\r\ncommunication, of a Commission designed to secure regularity and\r\nefficiency in the traffic arrangements should avoid confusion,\r\ncongestion and delay.\r\n\r\nThe association, on each of these Commissions, of the military and\r\ntechnical elements, with a strict definition of their respective powers,\r\nduties and responsibilities, should ensure the best use of the available\r\ntransport facilities under conditions in themselves practicable, and\r\nwithout the risk either of friction between the representatives of the\r\ntwo interests or, alternatively, of any interference with the railway\r\nservices owing to contradictory or impossible orders being given by\r\nindividual officers acting on their own responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe setting up of the supply depôts and regulating stations along the\r\nline of communication should prevent (i) the rushing through of supplies\r\nin excessive quantities to the extreme front; (ii) the congestion of\r\nrailway lines and stations; (iii) the undue accumulation of provisions\r\nat one point, with a corresponding deficiency elsewhere, and (iv) the\r\npossibility of large stocks being eventually seized by the enemy and\r\nmade use of by him to his own advantage.\r\n\r\nThe measures adopted both to prevent any excessive employment of railway\r\nwagons as storehouses on wheels and to secure their prompt unloading\r\nshould afford a greater guarantee of the best utilisation of rolling\r\nstock under conditions of, possibly, extreme urgency.\r\n\r\nFinally, the unification of control, the co-ordination of the many\r\ndifferent services involved, and the harmony of working established\r\nbetween all the various sections on the line of communication linking up\r\nthe interior of the country with the troops in the fighting line should\r\nassure, not only the nearest possible approach to complete efficiency in\r\nthe transport conditions, but the conferring of great advantages on the\r\narmies concerned, with a proportionate increase of their strength in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThe effect of all these things on the military position of France must\r\nneeds be great. Had France controlled a rail-transport organisation such\r\nas this--instead of none at all--in 1870-71; and had Germany controlled\r\na system no better than what we have seen to be the admittedly imperfect\r\none she put into operation on that occasion, the results of the\r\nFranco-German war and the subsequent course of events in Europe might\r\nalike have been wholly different.\r\n\r\n_Tests_ of what were being planned or projected in France as\r\nprecautionary measures, for application in war, could not, of course,\r\nbe carried out exhaustively in peace; but many parts of the machinery\r\ndesigned came into daily use as a matter of ordinary routine. Full\r\nadvantage was taken, also, of whatever opportunities did present\r\nthemselves--in the form of exercises in partial mobilisation, reviews,\r\nand other occasions involving the movement by rail of large bodies\r\nof troops--to effect such trials as were possible of regulations and\r\ninstructions already based on exhaustive studies by the military and\r\nrailway authorities. In 1892 the results attained were so satisfactory\r\nthat a German authority, Lieutenant Becker, writing in his book on \"Der\r\nnächste Krieg und die deutschen Bahnverwaltungen,\" (Hanover, 1893,)\r\nconcerning the trials in France, in that year, of the new conditions\r\nintroduced by the law of December 28, 1888, was not only greatly\r\nimpressed thereby but even appeared disposed to think that the French\r\nwere becoming superior to the Germans in that very organisation which\r\nthe latter had regarded as their own particular province. The following\r\npassages from his book may be worth recalling:--\r\n\r\n    Towards the middle of September, 1892, from a military\r\n    railway station improvised for the occasion, there were sent off\r\n    in less than eight hours forty-two trains conveying a complete\r\n    Army Corps of 25,000 men.\r\n\r\n    In their famous mobilisation test of 1887 the French\r\n    despatched from the Toulouse station 150 military trains without\r\n    interrupting the ordinary traffic, and without any accident.\r\n\r\n    Such figures speak a significant language. They show what\r\n    enormous masses of troops the railway can carry in the course of\r\n    a few hours to a given point....\r\n\r\n    If I have referred to the results obtained by our neighbours\r\n    on their railway systems, it is not because I have the least\r\n    fear as to the final issue of the next war. Quite the contrary;\r\n    but the fact does not prevent me from asking why the German\r\n    Army cannot base on the railways of that country the same hopes\r\n    which neighbouring countries are able to entertain in regard to\r\n    theirs.\r\n\r\nThe favourable impression thus given, even to a German critic, by the\r\nprogress France was making in her creation, not so much _de novo_ as _ab\r\novo_, of a system of organised military rail-transport, were confirmed\r\nby many subsequent trials, experiments and experiences, all, in turn,\r\nleading to further improvements in matters of detail; but it was,\r\nindeed, the \"nächste Krieg\" concerning which Lieutenant Becker wrote\r\nthat was to be the real test of the organisation which, during more than\r\nforty years of peace, France followed up with a zeal, a pertinacity and\r\na thoroughness fully equal to those of Germany herself.\r\n\r\nIn any case it would seem that France, though having to make up for\r\nthe headway gained by Germany, finally created a system of military\r\nrail-transport which would be able to stand the fullest comparison with\r\neven the now greatly-improved system of her traditional foe; while the\r\norganisation she thus elaborated, not for the purposes of aggression\r\nbut as an arm of her national defence, illustrates in a striking degree\r\nthe ever-increasing importance of the problem of rail-power, and the\r\ncomprehensive nature of the measures for its effective exercise which a\r\ngreat Continental nation regards as indispensable under the conditions\r\nof modern warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENSIVE RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nThe measures adopted included, also, the improvement of the French\r\nrailway system, since this was no less in need of amendment and\r\nadditions in order to adapt it to the needs of the military situation.\r\n\r\nWhilst, as we have seen in Chapter I, the important part that railways\r\nwere likely to play in war was recognised in France as early as 1833,\r\nand whilst, in 1842, attention was called in that country to the\r\n\"aggressive lines\" which Germany was then already building in the\r\ndirection of the French frontiers, the French railway system itself\r\nwas, prior to the war of 1870-71, developed on principles which\r\npractically ignored strategical considerations, were based mainly on\r\neconomic, political and local interests, and not only refrained from\r\nbecoming \"aggressive\" in turn, but even failed to provide adequately, as\r\nthey should have done, for the legitimate purposes of national defence.\r\n\r\nApart from the absence of any designs on the part of France against\r\nher neighbours' territory, during this period of her history, one of\r\nthe main reasons for the conditions just mentioned is to be found in\r\nthe predominant position of Paris as the capital and centre-point of\r\nFrench life and French movement. Germany at this time consisted of a\r\ncollection of States each of which had its own chief city and built its\r\nrailways to serve its own particular interests, without much regard\r\nfor the interests of its sister States, even if it escaped the risk\r\nof cherishing more or less jealousy towards them. In France there was\r\nbut one State and one capital, and Paris was regarded as the common\r\ncentre from which the main lines were to radiate in all directions.\r\nCommunication was thus established as between the capital and the\r\nprincipal inland towns or important points on the frontiers or on the\r\ncoasts of France; but the inadequate number of lateral or transverse\r\nlines linking up and connecting these main lines placed great difficulty\r\nin the way of communication between the provincial centres themselves\r\notherwise than viâ Paris.\r\n\r\nSome of these disadvantages were to have been overcome under a law\r\npassed in 1868 which approved the construction of seventeen new lines\r\nhaving a total length of 1,840 km. (1,143 miles). When, however, war\r\nbroke out in 1870, comparatively little had been done towards the\r\nachievement of this programme, and France entered upon the conflict with\r\na railway system which had been even less developed towards her eastern\r\nfrontiers than towards the north, the west and the south, while for the\r\npurposes of concentrating her troops in the first-mentioned direction\r\nshe had available only three lines, and of these three one alone was\r\nprovided with double-track throughout. Such were the inadequacies of the\r\nsystem at this time that the important line between Verdun and Metz had\r\nnot yet been completed.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the war come to an end than the French Government started\r\non the improvement of the railway system in order to adapt it to the\r\npossible if not prospective military requirements of the future, so that\r\nthey should never again be taken at a disadvantage; and in carrying on\r\nthis work--in addition to the reorganisation of their military-transport\r\nsystem in general--they showed an unexampled energy and thoroughness.\r\nWithin five years of the restoration of peace the French railway system\r\nhad already undergone an extension which, according to Captain A.\r\nPernot, as told in his \"Aperçu historique sur le service des transports\r\nmilitaires,\" would have been possible in but few countries in so short\r\na period; while of the situation at the time he wrote (1894) the same\r\nauthority declared:--\"One can say that everything is ready in a vast\r\norganisation which only awaits the word of command in order to prove the\r\nstrength of its capacity.\"\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to give exhaustive details of all that was done, it\r\nmay suffice to indicate generally the principles adopted.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of these related to an improvement of the\r\nconditions in and around Paris.\r\n\r\nHere the purposes specially aimed at were (1) to establish further\r\nconnecting links between the various trunk lines radiating from the\r\ncapital, and (2) to obviate the necessity for traffic from, for example,\r\nthe south or the west having to pass through Paris _en route_ to the\r\neast or the north.\r\n\r\nThese aims it was sought to effect by means of a series of circular\r\nrailways, or \"rings\" of railways, joining up the existing lines, and\r\nallowing of the transfer of military transport from one to the other\r\nwithout coming into Paris at all. An \"inner\" circular railway (\"Chemin\r\nde Fer de Petite Ceinture\") had already been constructed within the\r\nfortifications prior to 1870, and this was followed in 1879 by an\r\n\"outer\" line, (\"Chemin de Fer de Grande Ceinture\"), which provided a\r\nwider circle at an average distance of about 20 km. (12½ miles) and\r\nestablished direct rail connection, not only between a large number of\r\nthe more remote suburbs, together with the different trunk lines at a\r\ngreater distance from the city, but, also, between the various forts\r\nconstructed for the defence of Paris.\r\n\r\nThese circular railways were, in turn, succeeded by a series of\r\nconnecting links which ensured the provision of a complete ring of\r\nrail communication at a still greater distance around Paris, the towns\r\ncomprised therein including Rouen, Amiens, La Fère, Laon, Reims,\r\nChalons-sur-Marne, Troyes, Sens, Montargis, Orléans, Dreux, and so on\r\nback to Rouen. Within, again, this outermost ring there was provided\r\na further series of lines which, by linking up Orléans, Malesherbes,\r\nMontereau, Nogent, Epernay, Soissons, Beauvais and Dreux, established\r\nadditional connections between all the lines from Paris to the north and\r\nthe east of France, and gave increased facilities for the distribution\r\nin those directions of troops arriving at Orléans from the south-west,\r\nthis being once more done without any need for their entering Paris or\r\neven approaching it at a closer distance than about forty miles.\r\n\r\nOrléans itself was recognised as a point of great strategical importance\r\nin regard to the movement of troops, and it was, accordingly, provided\r\nwith a number of new lines radiating therefrom, and establishing better\r\nconnections with other lines. Tours and other centres of military\r\nsignificance, from the same point of view, were strengthened in a like\r\nmanner. At important junctions, and notably so in the case of Troyes\r\n(Champagne), loop lines were built in order that troop trains could be\r\ntransferred direct from one line to another without stopping, and with\r\nno need for shunting or for changing the position of the engine.\r\n\r\nIn the direction of the eastern frontier the line from Verdun to Metz\r\nwas completed, and by 1899 the three routes which could alone be made\r\nuse of in 1870-71 had been increased to ten. Most of them were provided\r\nwith double-track throughout, and all of them were independent of one\r\nanother, though having intercommunication by means of cross lines.\r\n\r\nOther new railways established connection with or between the forts on\r\nboth the eastern and the northern frontiers. Others, again, provided\r\ndirect communication between different harbours or between each of\r\nthem and strategical points in the interior, thus contributing to the\r\npossibilities of their defence in case of attack from the sea. Still\r\nothers were designed for the defence of the French Alps.\r\n\r\nApart from the provision of all these new lines, much was done in\r\nthe doubling or even the quadrupling of existing track wherever the\r\nquestion of military transport came into consideration at all. Then at\r\nrailway stations near to arsenals, and at important strategical centres,\r\nspecially long platforms were provided to allow of the rapid entraining\r\nof men or material in case of need.\r\n\r\nWhile, also, so much was being done for the improvement of the French\r\nrailway system from an avowedly strategical point of view, there were\r\nmany additional lines constructed or improvements made which, although\r\ndesigned to further the interests of trade and travel, also added to the\r\nsum total of available facilities for military transport.\r\n\r\nThe advantages specially aimed at were (1) the ensuring of a more\r\nrapid mobilisation of troops through the betterment of cross-country\r\nconnections; (2) the avoidance of congestion of traffic in Paris; (3)\r\nthe securing of a more rapid concentration on the frontiers, especially\r\nwhen each Army Corps could be assured the independent use of a\r\ndouble-track line of rails for its own use; and (4) the more effective\r\ndefence of all vital points.\r\n\r\nNational defence, rather than the building of strategical lines\r\ndesigned to serve \"aggressive\" purposes, was the fundamental principle\r\non which the policy thus followed since 1870-71 was based; and if,\r\nas Captain Pernot wrote in 1894, everything was even then ready for\r\nall emergencies, the continuous additions and improvements made since\r\nthat time, bringing the railway system of the country more and more\r\ninto harmony with the \"perfectionnement\" aimed at by France in the\r\norganisation of her military transport, must have made the conditions of\r\npreparedness still more complete by 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] For details concerning the functions and duties of the various\r\ndivisions, subdivisions, etc., see \"Mouvements et Transports.

Here there was no question of\r\nbuilding lines of invasion or lines to facilitate the massing of troops\r\non a neighbour's frontiers. The questions that alone seemed to arise\r\nin England were--(1) the relations between the State and the companies\r\nin regard to the use of the railways for the transport of troops and\r\nmilitary necessaries under conditions either of peace or of war; (2)\r\nthe employment of railways both for resisting invasion and for the\r\nconveyance of expeditionary forces to the port of embarkation; (3)\r\nthe adoption of such means as would ensure the efficient working of\r\nthe railways under war conditions; and (4) the creation of an Army\r\nengineering force providing for the construction, repair, operation\r\nor destruction of railways either at home, in case of invasion, or to\r\nfacilitate operations in overseas expeditions through the building and\r\nworking of military railways.\r\n\r\nWith these various considerations it may be convenient to deal in the\r\norder as here given.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE AND THE RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nIn the Railway Regulation Act, 1842, (5 and 6 Vict., c. 55,) entitled\r\n\"An Act for the better Regulation of Railways and for the Conveyance of\r\nTroops,\" it was provided, by section 20:--\r\n\r\n    Whenever it shall be necessary to move any of the officers\r\n    or soldiers of her Majesty's forces of the line ... by any\r\n    railway, the directors shall permit them, with baggage, stores,\r\n    arms, ammunition and other necessaries and things, to be\r\n    conveyed, at the usual hours of starting, at such prices or upon\r\n    such conditions as may be contracted for between the Secretary\r\n    at War and such railway companies on the production of a route\r\n    or order signed by the proper authorities.\r\n\r\nThis was the first provision made in the United Kingdom in respect to\r\nthe conveyance of troops by rail. It was succeeded in 1844 by another\r\nAct (7 and 8 Vict., c. 85,) by which (sec. 12) railway companies were\r\nrequired to provide conveyances for the transport of troops at fares\r\nnot exceeding a scale given in the Act, and maximum fares were also\r\nprescribed in regard to public baggage, stores, ammunition, (with\r\ncertain exceptions, applying to gunpowder and explosives,) and other\r\nmilitary necessaries. In 1867 these provisions were extended to the Army\r\nReserve. Further revision of the fares and charges took place under\r\nthe Cheap Trains Act, 1883, (46 and 47 Vict., c. 34,) entitled \"An Act\r\nto amend the Law Relating to Railway Passenger Duty and to amend and\r\nconsolidate the law relating to the conveyance of the Queen's forces by\r\nrailway.\"\r\n\r\nState control of the railways in case of war was provided for under the\r\nRegulation of the Forces Act, 1871, (34 and 35 Vict., c. 86,) \"An Act\r\nfor the Regulation of the Regular and Auxiliary Forces of the Crown, and\r\nfor other purposes relating thereto.\" Section 16 laid down that--\r\n\r\n    When her Majesty, by Order in Council, declares that an\r\n    emergency has arisen in which it is expedient for the public\r\n    service that her Majesty's Government should have control\r\n    over the railroads of the United Kingdom, or any of them, the\r\n    Secretary of State may, by warrant under his hand, empower any\r\n    person or persons named in such warrant to take possession in\r\n    the name or on behalf of her Majesty of any railroad in the\r\n    United Kingdom, and of the plant belonging thereto, or of any\r\n    part thereof, and may take possession of any plant without\r\n    taking possession of the railroad itself, and to use the same\r\n    for her Majesty's service at such times and in such manner as\r\n    the Secretary of State may direct; and the directors, officers\r\n    and servants of any such railroad shall obey the directions of\r\n    the Secretary of State as to the user of such railroad or plant\r\n    as aforesaid for her Majesty's service.\r\n\r\n    Any warrant granted by the said Secretary of State in\r\n    pursuance of this section shall remain in force for one week\r\n    only, but may be renewed from week to week so long as, in the\r\n    opinion of the said Secretary of State, the emergency continues.\r\n\r\nProvision was also made for the payment of \"full compensation\" to the\r\ninterests concerned.\r\n\r\nThe powers of control thus acquired by the Government followed, in\r\neffect, closely upon the precedent already established in the United\r\nStates, (see p. 16,) even although they were not defined with the same\r\nelaborate detail. On the other hand greater emphasis is laid in the\r\nEnglish Act on the provision that the Government \"may take possession\r\nof any plant without taking possession of the railroad itself.\" This\r\ngives them the right to take over the locomotives and rolling stock of\r\nany railway in any part of the United Kingdom, even though the lines\r\nin question may not themselves be wanted for the purposes of military\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the National Defence Act, 1888, (51 and 52\r\nVict., c. 31,) traffic for naval and military purposes is to have\r\nprecedence over other traffic on the railways of the United Kingdom\r\nwhenever an Order for the embodiment of the Militia is in force.\r\n\r\nIt was by virtue of the above section of the Act of 1871 that the\r\nGovernment took control over the railways of Great Britain on the\r\noutbreak of war in 1914.\r\n\r\nAs regards the earlier Acts of 1842 and 1844, these were mainly domestic\r\nmeasures relating to the conveyance of troops in time of peace rather\r\nthan war. The beginnings of organisation of military rail-transport\r\nfor the purposes of war followed, rather, on a realisation both of the\r\npossibilities of invasion and of the weakness of the position in which\r\nEngland at one time stood from the point of view of national defence.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVASION PROSPECTS AND HOME DEFENCE\r\n\r\nIn 1847 the Duke of Wellington, (then Commander-in-Chief,) addressed\r\nto Sir John Burgoyne a letter in which he said he had endeavoured to\r\nawaken the attention of different Administrations to the defenceless\r\nstate of the country. We had, he declared, no defence, or hope of chance\r\nof defence, except in our Fleet, and he was especially sensible both of\r\nthe certainty of failure if we did not, at an early moment, attend to\r\nthe measures necessary to be taken for our defence and of \"the disgrace,\r\nthe indelible disgrace,\" of such failure. Then, in words that greatly\r\nimpressed the country, he added:--\r\n\r\n    I am bordering upon seventy-seven years of age, passed in\r\n    honour; I hope that the Almighty may protect me from being the\r\n    witness of the tragedy which I cannot persuade my contemporaries\r\n    to take measures to avert.\r\n\r\nAs the result alike of this pathetic warning; of a \"Letter on the\r\nDefence of England by Volunteer Corps and Militia\" issued in pamphlet\r\nform by Sir Charles Napier in 1852; and of the Indian Mutiny in 1857,\r\nwhich event called attention to the defenceless condition of the Empire\r\nas a whole, continuous efforts were made to secure the creation of\r\nVolunteer Corps for the purposes of defence. For a period of twelve\r\nyears these efforts met with persistent discouragement, the Government\r\nrefusing official recognition to certain corps of riflemen tentatively\r\nformed; but in 1859 the prospect of an early invasion of this country by\r\nFrance aroused public feeling to such an extent that on May 12 the then\r\nSecretary of State for War, General Peel, addressed a circular to the\r\nLord-Lieutenants of counties in Great Britain announcing that Volunteer\r\nCorps might be formed under an Act passed in 1804, when a like course\r\nhad been adopted as a precautionary measure against the threatened\r\ninvasion of England by Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe formation of Volunteer Corps was thereupon taken up with the\r\ngreatest zeal, and by the end of 1860 the number of Volunteers enrolled\r\nthroughout Great Britain was no fewer than 120,000. Other results of the\r\nnational awakening in 1859 were the public discussion of the questions\r\nof coast defence and armoured trains, (of which mention has been made in\r\nChapter VII,) and the appropriation, in 1860, of a loan of seven and a\r\nhalf millions for the improvement of our coast defences and notably the\r\nfortifications of Portsmouth and Plymouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINEER AND RAILWAY STAFF CORPS\r\n\r\nAlready in December, 1859, the necessity for some definite engineering\r\ninstruction for Volunteers was being pointed out, and in January, 1860,\r\nthe first corps of Volunteer Engineers was created, under the title\r\nof the 1st Middlesex Volunteer Engineers. Similar corps were formed\r\nin various parts of the country, and by 1867 the number of Volunteer\r\nEngineers enrolled was 6,580.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1860 a further proposal was made for the formation\r\nof a body which, composed of eminent civil engineers, the general\r\nmanagers of leading lines of railway, and the principal railway\r\ncontractors or other employers of labour, would undertake a variety of\r\nduties considered no less essential in the interests of national defence.\r\n\r\nThere was, in the first place, the question of the transport by rail\r\nalike of Volunteers and of the regular forces, either on the occasion of\r\nreviews or for the protection of our coasts against an invader. While\r\nit was evident that the railways could be efficiently worked only by\r\ntheir own officers, it was no less obvious that plans for the movement\r\nof large bodies of men, and especially of troops, with horses, guns,\r\nammunition and stores, should be well considered and prepared long\r\nbeforehand, and not left for the occasion or the emergency when the need\r\nfor them would arise.\r\n\r\nIn the next place it was suggested that the engineering talent of the\r\ncountry should be made available for the purpose of supplementing the\r\nservices of the Royal Engineers in carrying out various defensive\r\nworks, such as the destruction of railway lines, bridges and roads, the\r\nthrowing up of earthworks, or the flooding of the lowland districts,\r\nwith a view to resisting the advance of a possible invader.\r\n\r\nFinally the great contractors were to be brought into the combination\r\nso that they could provide the labour necessary for the execution of\r\nthese defensive works under the direction of the civil engineers, who\r\nthemselves would act under the direction of the military commanders.\r\n\r\nEach of the three groups was to discharge the function for which it\r\nwas specially adapted, while the co-ordination of the three, for the\r\npurpose of strengthening the country's powers of resisting invasion, was\r\nexpected to add greatly to the value of the proposed organisation.\r\n\r\nThe author of this scheme was Mr. Charles Manby, F.R.S., (1804-1884,) a\r\ndistinguished civil engineer who for nearly half a century was secretary\r\nof the Institution of Civil Engineers and was closely associated with\r\nthe leading civil engineers, contractors and railway interests of the\r\ncountry. He submitted his ideas to several members of the Council\r\nof his Institution, and though, at first, the scheme was not well\r\nreceived, he was subsequently so far encouraged that in August, 1860,\r\nhe laid his plan before Mr. Sidney Herbert, then Minister at War in\r\nLord Palmerston's second administration. Mr. Herbert expressed cordial\r\napproval of the project, giving the assurance, on behalf of the War\r\nOffice, that an organisation on the basis suggested could not fail to be\r\nof public benefit; but Mr. Manby still met with difficulties alike from\r\nseveral members of the Council, who either offered direct opposition\r\nto the scheme or else gave unwilling consent to join, and, also, from\r\nthe railway companies, who thought that arrangements for rail-transport\r\nmight very well be left to themselves, and that there was no necessity\r\nfor the suggested system so far as they, at least, were concerned.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances Mr. Manby made, at first, very little progress;\r\nbut he was unremitting in his efforts to demonstrate alike to civil\r\nengineers and to the railway companies the practical benefits from\r\nthe point of view of public interests that would result from the\r\norganisation he advocated, and in 1864 he felt sufficiently encouraged\r\nto lay his views once more before the War Office. Earl de Grey, then in\r\ncharge of that Department, thereupon instructed the Inspector-General\r\nof Volunteers, Colonel McMurdo, (afterwards General Sir W. M. McMurdo,\r\nC.B.,) to inquire into and report to him on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the result there was created, in January, 1865, a body known as the\r\nEngineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps, constituted, according to\r\nits rules, \"for the purpose of directing the application of skilled\r\nlabour and of railway transport to the purposes of national defence,\r\nand for preparing, in time of peace, a system on which such duties\r\nshould be conducted.\" The Corps was to consist of officers only, and its\r\nmembers were to be civil engineers and contractors, officers of railway\r\nand dock companies, and, under special circumstances, Board of Trade\r\nInspectors of Railways. Civil engineers of standing and experience who\r\nhad directed the construction of the chief railways and other important\r\nworks, general managers of railways and commercial docks, and Board\r\nof Trade Inspectors of Railways, were alone eligible for the rank of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel. Other civil engineers and contractors connected\r\nchiefly with railway works, and, also, railway officers other than\r\ngeneral managers, take the rank of Major. Col. McMurdo was appointed\r\nHonorary Colonel of the Corps on February 9, 1865.[29] As ultimately\r\nconstituted, the corps consisted of an Honorary Colonel (now Maj.-Gen.\r\nD. A. Scott, C.V.O., C.B., D.S.C.), thirty Lieutenant-Colonels including\r\na Commandant, (now Lieut.-Col. Sir William Forbes, general manager of\r\nthe London, Brighton and South Coast Railway) and twenty Majors.[30]\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONS AND PURPOSES\r\n\r\nThat the Corps thus created was the direct outcome, first, of the\r\nVolunteer movement, and, through that movement, of the state of\r\nsemi-panic into which the country had drifted in 1859, as the result\r\nboth of the anticipations of invasion and the admitted weakness, at\r\nthat time, of our national defences, has thus been clearly established.\r\nWriting in 1869, Major-General McMurdo, who had been raised to that\r\nrank in 1868, said in a pamphlet he issued under the title of \"Rifle\r\nVolunteers for Field Service\" that the Corps was \"prepared to work,\r\nnot for Volunteers alone, but for the entire defensive forces of the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nIn this same publication Major-General McMurdo gave an account of the\r\nfunctions and purposes the Corps had been designed to serve. Alluding\r\nfirst to the Volunteer movement, he showed how the railway carriage must\r\nboth carry and shelter the Volunteer when moving from one part of the\r\ncountry to another; and he proceeded:--\r\n\r\n    I will ask you to look attentively for a moment at a\r\n    Bradshaw's railway map, and you will see that throughout the\r\n    network of rails that overspreads the land none of the meshes,\r\n    so to speak, in any vital parts of the country, exceed fifteen\r\n    miles across, from rail to rail; but as the eye approaches the\r\n    Metropolis, or any of the commercial centres, these meshes are\r\n    diminished to about one-half the area of the others.\r\n\r\nHe then dealt with the operations which the movement of troops along\r\nthese lines of railway would involve, and continued:--\r\n\r\n    The railway schemes for the accomplishment of such delicate\r\n    operations would emanate from the Council of the Engineer and\r\n    Railway Staff Corps....\r\n\r\n    During peace the railway branch of this body is employed in\r\n    working out hypothetical plans of campaign, in the development\r\n    of which they manipulate in theory the entire rolling-stock\r\n    and railway resources of the country, elaborated by special\r\n    time-tables and technical reports.\r\n\r\n    The share taken by the civil engineers is not confined to\r\n    providing merely for the class of railway works contingent on\r\n    war, whether of construction, demolition, or of reconstruction,\r\n    but in supplying the military engineers with information, advice\r\n    and labour. No one, for example, can be more familiar with the\r\n    features and character of a district than the engineer who has\r\n    constructed a line of railway through it. No one is so well able\r\n    to point out the results of _letting in_ that which he had been\r\n    so often employed in _keeping out_, viz., the inundations of the\r\n    sea. None better acquainted with the existing distribution of\r\n    labour power throughout the country, and of the means by which\r\n    it could be concentrated upon given points, for the construction\r\n    of works of defence. All these elements, in short, by which\r\n    the gigantic resources of our country may be safely wielded\r\n    for her defence, are now being silently considered and woven\r\n    into strategical schemes of operations by these eminent and\r\n    patriotic men, the value of whose voluntary services will not be\r\n    fully comprehended or appreciated till the day comes when the\r\n    discomfiture of the invader shall be accomplished through their\r\n    instrumentality.\r\n\r\nThe same distinguished authority wrote concerning the Engineer and\r\nRailway Volunteer Staff Corps in an article on \"Volunteers\" which he\r\ncontributed to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" (ninth edition):--\r\n\r\n    The ready labour power of this useful Corps is estimated\r\n    at from 12,000 to 20,000 navvies, with tools, barrows and\r\n    commissariat complete. It has already performed important\r\n    service in tabulating, and printing at great private cost,\r\n    complete time-tables and special reports for six general\r\n    concentrations against possible invasion. A special return\r\n    was also prepared by the Corps (the first of its kind) of the\r\n    entire rolling stock of all the railways in Great Britain.\r\n    This important work--which is corrected and republished\r\n    annually--shows where the requisite number of carriages of every\r\n    description can be obtained for the composition of troop trains.\r\n\r\nIn the official catalogue of books in the War Office Library there is an\r\nitem which reads:--\"Time Tables for Special Troop Trains, etc. Compiled\r\nby the Railway Companies. 311 pp. 8vo. London, 1866.\" This, presumably,\r\nrefers to the first of the complete time tables mentioned in the\r\n\"Encyclopædia Britannica\" article as having been compiled by the Corps.\r\nIt is evident, from the date given, that the Corps must have got quickly\r\nto work after its formation in 1865.\r\n\r\nAt one time there was an expectation that the Engineer and Railway\r\nVolunteer Staff Corps would develop into a body exercising still wider\r\nand more responsible duties than those already mentioned. On this point\r\nwe have the testimony of the late Sir George Findlay, formerly general\r\nmanager of the London and North-Western Railway Company, and himself a\r\nLieutenant-Colonel in the Corps.\r\n\r\nCol. J. S. Rothwell had written some articles[31] in which, while\r\nadmitting their practically unlimited resources, he questioned the\r\nability of the British railways, at a few hours notice, to transport to\r\nany part of our coasts which might be the scene of a hostile invasion a\r\nsufficient body of troops to dispute the advance of an army upon London,\r\nand he further suggested that the whole question was one which had not\r\nyet received the mature consideration it deserved. Col. Rothwell said,\r\nin the course of what he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    Though the actual working of our railways must be left in\r\n    the hands of the proper railway officials, it does not follow\r\n    that the planning of the arrangements for the military traffic\r\n    should also be entrusted to them exclusively. This, however,\r\n    appears to be contemplated, as, under existing circumstances,\r\n    such arrangements would rest with the members of a body called\r\n    the \"Volunteer Engineer and Railway Staff Corps.\"... Though the\r\n    efficiency of these gentlemen in their own sphere is undeniable,\r\n    it appears open to question whether they are likely to have\r\n    sufficient leisure personally to work out the details of a\r\n    large concentration of troops by rail, and whether the special\r\n    requirements of military transport will be fully appreciated by\r\n    them, or by the subordinates whom they presumably will employ.\r\n\r\nMuch, he argued, required to be done before the country could be\r\nconsidered ready to meet a possible invader; and he concluded:--\r\n\r\n    If the invasion of England is to be regarded as an event\r\n    which is within the bounds of possibility, it is surely not\r\n    unreasonable to ask that those precautionary measures which\r\n    require time for their elaboration shall be thoroughly worked\r\n    out before there is any risk of our wanting to employ them. The\r\n    organisation for the conveyance of our troops by railway is such\r\n    a measure.\r\n\r\nTo these criticisms Sir George Findlay replied in an article \"On the\r\nUse of Railways in the United Kingdom for the Conveyance of Troops,\"\r\npublished in the _United Service Magazine_ for April, 1892. The complete\r\nnetwork of railways covering these islands, admirably equipped and\r\nefficiently worked as they were, would, he declared, be found equal\r\nto any part they might be called upon to play in a scheme of national\r\ndefence. As regarded the attention already paid to the question he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    The War Office, so far from having in any way neglected\r\n    the subject, have devoted considerable attention to it, and a\r\n    complete scheme for the working of our railways for transport\r\n    purposes in time of war has been elaborated, and would at once\r\n    be put in operation, if ever the emergency arose.\r\n\r\nPassing on to describe the composition and duties of the Engineer and\r\nRailway Volunteer Staff Corps, he spoke of its members as meeting in\r\ncouncil at their headquarters to discuss from time to time details of\r\nrailway organisation and other matters delegated to their consideration,\r\nafterwards reporting their conclusions to the War Office; and he went on\r\nto say that for the operation of the railways, under State control, on\r\nany occasion of national energy or danger--\r\n\r\n    A draft scheme has been prepared, has been worked out in\r\n    detail, and would, in all probability, be adopted and put in\r\n    operation if, unhappily, the necessity should ever arise.\r\n\r\n    This scheme in its main features provides that, at such\r\n    time as we are contemplating, the principal railway officials\r\n    in Great Britain and Ireland would at once become, for the\r\n    time being, the officers of the State, and in addition to the\r\n    general managers of the leading railways, who are officers of\r\n    the Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps, military rank\r\n    of some kind would be conferred upon the engineers, locomotive\r\n    superintendents, chief passenger superintendents and goods\r\n    managers of the principal railway companies, as well as on the\r\n    managers of the principal Irish railways.\r\n\r\n    The railways of the country would be divided into sections,\r\n    and for each section there would be a committee composed\r\n    of the general managers of the railways included in the\r\n    section, together with the principal engineers, locomotive\r\n    superintendents and other chief officers. The railways would\r\n    be worked and controlled for military purposes by these\r\n    committees of sections, each committee having as its president a\r\n    Lieutenant-Colonel of the Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff\r\n    Corps, who would be directly responsible for providing transport\r\n    for troops and stores over the section of which his committee\r\n    had charge, while if the operation to be carried out required\r\n    the co-operation of one or more sections of the railways, the\r\n    committees of those sections would act in unison. In such a\r\n    case the Quartermaster-General's requisition for the service to\r\n    be performed would be made upon the president of the section\r\n    embracing the point of departure, that officer and his committee\r\n    taking the initiative and arranging with the other committees\r\n    for the performance of the service.\r\n\r\n    For each section, or group, of railways, a military officer\r\n    of rank would be appointed, with full power to arrange for\r\n    food, forage and water for the troops and horses _en route_,\r\n    and having at his disposal a sufficient number of soldiers or\r\n    labourers to assist in loading and unloading baggage, stores,\r\n    etc., at the points of entrainment and detrainment within his\r\n    section. He would also be able to command the services of the\r\n    Royal or Volunteer Engineers to assist in the erection of\r\n    temporary platforms or landings, or the laying down of temporary\r\n    rails, and would be instructed to co-operate with, and assist\r\n    in every way, the committee of section having charge of his\r\n    district, but not in any way to attempt to interfere with the\r\n    working of the line or the movement of the trains or traffic.\r\n\r\nThe number of sections into which the railways were to be divided for\r\nthe purposes of this scheme was nine. After defining the various areas,\r\nSir George continued:--\r\n\r\n    It is contemplated that during any such period of crisis as\r\n    we are now discussing, the Council of the Engineer and Railway\r\n    Volunteer Staff Corps would be sitting _en permanence_ at its\r\n    headquarters, and, with a full knowledge of the nature and\r\n    extent of the operations to be carried out, would have power to\r\n    regulate the supply and distribution of rolling stock throughout\r\n    the area affected, all the vehicles in the country being, for\r\n    the time being, treated as a common stock.\r\n\r\n    This is a mere outline of the scheme, with the further\r\n    details of which it is not necessary to trouble the reader,\r\n    though probably enough has been said to show that the subject,\r\n    far from having been neglected, as Colonel Rothwell appears to\r\n    assume, has been carefully studied and thought out.\r\n\r\nHad the scheme in question been matured and adopted on the lines here\r\nstated, a still greater degree of importance would have been attached\r\nto the position and proceedings of a Corps then--and still--almost\r\nunknown to the world at large, since its chief function was to carry out\r\ninvestigations at the request of the authorities, and prepare reports,\r\nstatements and statistics which have invariably got no further than the\r\nWar Office and the Horse Guards, where, alone, the value of the services\r\nrendered has been fully understood and appreciated. The scheme was,\r\nhowever, allowed to drop, the policy eventually adopted being based,\r\npreferably, (1) on the railways of Great Britain being operated in war\r\ntime as one group instead of in a series of groups or sections; and (2)\r\non such operation being entrusted to a body specially created for the\r\npurpose; though prior to the adoption of the latter course there was to\r\nbe a fresh development in another direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR RAILWAY COUNCIL\r\n\r\nWhile the Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps remained, down to\r\n1896, the only organised body which (apart from the individual railway\r\ncompanies) Government departments could consult as to the technical\r\nworking and traffic facilities of the railways, from the point of view\r\nof military transport, it was thought desirable, in the year mentioned,\r\nto supplement that Corps by a smaller body known at first as the \"Army\r\nRailway Council\" and afterwards as the \"War Railway Council.\"\r\n\r\nDesigned to act in a purely advisory capacity, without assuming any\r\nadministrative or executive functions, this Council was eventually\r\nconstituted as follows:--The Deputy Quartermaster-General (president);\r\nsix railway managers, who represented the British railway companies\r\nand might or might not already be members of the Engineer and Railway\r\nStaff Corps; one Board of Trade Inspector of Railways; two members\r\n(not being railway managers) of the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps;\r\nthe Deputy-Assistant Quartermaster-General; one mobilisation officer;\r\ntwo Naval officers; and one officer of the Royal Engineers, with a\r\nrepresentative of the Quartermaster-General's Department as secretary.\r\n\r\nThe Council approximated closely to the \"Commission Militaire Superieure\r\ndes Chemins de Fer\" in France, of which an account has been given in\r\nChapter IX. It also undertook many of the duties which in the case of\r\nthe German Army would be performed by a special section of the General\r\nStaff; though some of these duties it took over from the Engineer and\r\nRailway Staff Corps, reducing the functions and the importance of that\r\nbody proportionately.\r\n\r\nIn time of peace the Council was (1) generally to advise the Secretary\r\nof State for War on matters relating to military rail-transport; (2) to\r\ndraw up, in conjunction with the different railway companies concerned,\r\nand on the basis of data to be supplied to them by the War Office, a\r\ndetailed scheme for the movement of troops on mobilisation; (3) to\r\narrange in advance as to the composition of the trains which would be\r\nrequired for any such movement; (4) to determine the nature of the\r\ndata to be asked for from the railway companies,[32] and to prepare\r\nthe necessary regulations and instructions in regard to the said troop\r\nmovements; (5) to draw up rules for the organisation of a body of\r\nRailway Staff Officers who, located at railway stations to be selected\r\nby the Council, would act there as intermediaries between the railway\r\nofficials and the troops; and (6) to confer with the different railway\r\ncompanies as to the provision of such extra sidings, loading platforms,\r\nramps, barriers, etc., as might be necessary to facilitate military\r\ntransport, and to decide on the best means by which the provision\r\nthereof could be arranged. Information on these subjects was to be\r\ncarefully compiled, elaborated, and, with explanatory maps, placed on\r\nrecord for use as required.\r\n\r\nIn the event of mobilisation, or of some national emergency, the Council\r\nwas, also, to advise the Secretary of State for War in regard to matters\r\nrelating to the movement of troops by rail; to act as a medium of\r\ncommunication between the War Office and the railway companies, and to\r\nmake all the necessary arrangements in connection with such movements.\r\n\r\nOther questions likely to arise, and requiring consideration in time\r\nof peace, included the guarding of the railways against possible\r\nattack; the prompt repair of any damage that might be done to them; the\r\nequipment of armoured trains, and the provision of ambulance trains on\r\nlines where they might be required.\r\n\r\nAll these and various other matters were dealt with at the periodical\r\nmeetings held by the Council, which, within the range of its limitations\r\nas an advisory body, rendered good service to the War Office; though\r\nthat Department was still left to deal with the individual railway\r\ncompanies in regard to all arrangements and matters of detail directly\r\nconcerning them.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAY TRANSPORT OFFICERS\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing statement as to the functions to be discharged by the\r\nWar Railway Council it is mentioned that these were to include the\r\ndrawing up of rules for the organisation of a body of Railway Staff\r\nOfficers who were to act as intermediaries between the troops and the\r\nrailway station staffs in the conduct of military rail-transport.\r\n\r\nWe touch here upon those questions of control and organisation of\r\nmilitary traffic which had been a fruitful source of trouble in earlier\r\nwars, and more especially so on the French railways in the war of\r\n1870-71. There was, indeed, much wisdom in the attempt now being made,\r\nas a precautionary measure, to provide well in advance against the risk\r\nof similar experiences in regard to movements of British troops by rail,\r\nwhile the course adopted led to the creation of a system which was to\r\nensure excellent results later on.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance the officers appointed under the system here in\r\nquestion were known as \"Railway Control Officers,\" (R.C.O.'s,) their\r\nchief as the \"Director of Railways,\" (D.R.,) and the organisation itself\r\nas the \"Railway Control Establishment\"; but the titles of Railway\r\nTransport Officers (R.T.O.'s), Director of Railway Transport (D.R.T.)\r\nand Transport Establishments were afterwards substituted.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the Director of Railway Transport are thus defined in\r\nField Service Regulations, Part II, section 23 (1913):--\r\n\r\n    Provision of railway transport and administration of\r\n    railway transport personnel. Control, construction, working and\r\n    maintenance of all railways. Provision of telegraph operators\r\n    for railway circuits. Control and working of telephones and\r\n    telegraphs allotted to the railway service. For the erection\r\n    and maintenance of all telegraph circuits on railways which are\r\n    worked by the troops, a representative of the Director of Army\r\n    Signals will be attached to his headquarters and the necessary\r\n    signal troops allotted to him as may be ordered by the I.G.C.\r\n    (Inspector-General of Communications).\r\n\r\nAs regards the Railway Transport Establishments, the Regulations say\r\n(section 62):--\r\n\r\n    In railway matters, the authority of each member of a\r\n    railway transport establishment will be paramount on that\r\n    portion of a railway system where he is posted for duty.\r\n\r\n    Railway technical officials will always receive the demands\r\n    of the troops for railway transport through the railway\r\n    transport establishment.\r\n\r\n    Except when fighting is imminent or in progress, a member of\r\n    the railway transport establishment will receive orders from the\r\n    Director of Railway Transport only, or his representative.\r\n\r\n    An officer, or officers, of the railway transport\r\n    establishment, recognized by a badge worn on the left arm marked\r\n    R.T.O., will be posted for duty at each place where troops are\r\n    constantly entraining, detraining, or halting _en route_. Their\r\n    chief duties will be:--\r\n\r\n    1. To facilitate the transport of troops, animals and\r\n    material.\r\n\r\n    2. To act as a channel of communication between the military\r\n    authorities and the technical railway personnel.\r\n\r\n    3. To advise the local military authorities as to the\r\n    capacity and possibilities of the railway.\r\n\r\n    4. To bring to the notice of the Director of Railway\r\n    Transport any means by which the carrying power of the railway\r\n    may, for military purposes, be increased.\r\n\r\nAll details as to the entraining and detraining of troops and the\r\nloading and unloading of stores will be arranged in conjunction with the\r\ntechnical officials by the railway transport establishment, who will\r\nmeet all troops arriving to entrain, inform commanders of the times\r\nand places of entrainment, and allot trucks and carriages to units in\r\nbulk. They will see that the necessary rolling stock is provided by\r\nthe railway officials, that only the prescribed amount of baggage is\r\nloaded, and that no unauthorised person travels by rail. They will meet\r\nall troop trains, and see that troops and stores are detrained with the\r\nutmost despatch.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed from these regulations that, whatever his own rank\r\nmay be, the R.T.O., subject to the instructions he has received from his\r\nsuperior Transport Officer, exercises at the railway station to which he\r\nis delegated an authority that not even a General may question or seek\r\nto set aside by giving orders direct to the station staff. The R.T.O.\r\nalone is the \"channel of communication\" between the military and the\r\nrailway elements. He it is who, acting in conjunction with the railway\r\npeople, must see that all the details in connection with entraining and\r\ndetraining are properly arranged and efficiently carried out, while the\r\noperations of the station staff are, in turn, greatly facilitated alike\r\nby his co-operation and by the fact that there is now only one military\r\nauthority to be dealt with at a station instead, possibly, of several\r\nacting more or less independently of one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUNTEER REVIEWS\r\n\r\nWhile all these developments had been proceeding, the railway companies\r\nhad, since the formation of the Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff\r\nCorps, given repeated evidence of their capacity to move large bodies\r\nof Volunteers with complete efficiency. They specially distinguished\r\nthemselves in this respect on the occasion of the great Volunteer\r\nreviews held from time to time. In a book entitled \"England's Naval\r\nand Military Weakness,\" (London, 1882,) Major James Walter, of the 4th\r\nLancashire Artillery Volunteers, was highly eulogistic of what was done\r\nby the railways on the occasion of the reviews in Edinburgh and Windsor\r\nin 1881. In regard to the Windsor review he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    The broad result has been, so far as the railway part of\r\n    the business goes, to prove that it is perfectly feasible to\r\n    concentrate fifty thousand men from all parts of the kingdom\r\n    in twenty-four hours.... The two lines most concerned in the\r\n    Windsor review--the Great Western and the South Western--carried\r\n    out this great experiment with ... the regularity and dispatch\r\n    of the Scotch mail.\r\n\r\nMajor Walter seems to have had the idea, rightly or wrongly, that the\r\nsuccess of this performance was mainly due to the Engineer and Railway\r\nVolunteer Staff Corps. He says concerning that body:--\r\n\r\n    Not the least valued result of the Windsor and Edinburgh\r\n    reviews of 1881 is the having introduced with becoming\r\n    prominence to public knowledge the necessary and indispensable\r\n    services of the \"Engineer and Railway Volunteer Staff Corps.\"\r\n    Until these reviews bore testimony to the national importance of\r\n    this Corps, few knew anything of its duties, or even existence,\r\n    beyond a list of officers recorded in the Army List.... Since\r\n    the embodiment of the Volunteers the Engineer and Railway\r\n    Transport Corps has done much service, invariably thorough and\r\n    without a hitch.... These several officers of the Railway Staff\r\n    Corps set about their transport work of the 1881 reviews in a\r\n    manner worthy of their vocation. They proved to the country that\r\n    their Corps was a reality and necessity.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the authors of the \"Army Book for the British Empire\" wrote (p.\r\n531):--\r\n\r\n    There is every reason to believe that, in case of the\r\n    military forces in the United Kingdom being mobilised for the\r\n    purposes of home defence, and being concentrated in any part\r\n    or parts of the country for the purpose of guarding against or\r\n    confronting an invasion, the railway arrangements would work\r\n    satisfactorily. The remarkable success which has attended the\r\n    concentration of large bodies of Volunteers gathered from all\r\n    quarters of the Kingdom for military functions and reviews, on\r\n    more than one occasion, has shown the extraordinary capabilities\r\n    of the British railway system for military transport on a great\r\n    scale. Rolling stock is abundant. The more important lines in\r\n    England have a double line of rails; some have four or more\r\n    rails. Gradients, moreover, as a rule are easy, an important\r\n    point, since troop trains are very heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR\r\n\r\nWhile no one was likely to dispute these conclusions, it had to be\r\nremembered that the transport by rail even of exceptionally large bodies\r\nof Volunteers, carrying their rifles only, was a very different matter\r\nfrom the conveyance, under conditions of great pressure, of large forces\r\nof troops accompanied by horses, guns, ammunition, road wagons, stores\r\nand other necessaries for prospective actual warfare. So the accepted\r\ncapacity of the British railways had still to stand the test of actual\r\nwar conditions, with or without the accompaniment of invasion; and this\r\ntest was applied, to a certain extent, by the South African War.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the military traffic on that occasion passed over the lines\r\nof the London and South Western Railway Company, troops from all parts\r\nof the country being conveyed by different routes and different lines of\r\nrailway to Southampton, whence they and their stores, etc., were shipped\r\nto the Cape. Such was the magnitude of this traffic that between the\r\noutbreak of the war, in 1899, and the end of 1900 there were carried on\r\nthe London and South Western, and despatched from Southampton, 6,160\r\nofficers; 229,097 men; 29,500 horses; and 1,085 wheeled vehicles. The\r\nconveyance of this traffic involved the running of 1,154 special trains,\r\nin addition to a large number of others carrying baggage, stores,\r\netc. At times the pressure was very great. On October 20, 1899, five\r\ntransports sailed from Southampton with 167 officers and 4,756 men,\r\nbesides guns horses and wagons. Yet the whole of the operations were\r\nconducted with perfect smoothness, there being no overtaxing either of\r\nthe railway facilities or of the dock accommodation.[33]\r\n\r\nMuch of this smoothness of working was due to the fact that the War\r\nOffice had, in accordance with the principle adopted on the appointment\r\nof the War Railway Council, stationed at Southampton a Railway Transport\r\nOfficer who was to act as a connecting link, or intermediary, between\r\nthe railway, the docks, the military and the Admiralty authorities,\r\nco-ordinating their requirements, superintending the arrivals by train,\r\narranging for and directing the embarkation of the troops and their\r\nequipment in the transports allotted to them, and preventing any of\r\nthat confusion which otherwise might well have arisen. Similar officers\r\nhad also been stationed by the War Office at leading railway stations\r\nthroughout the country to ensure co-operation between the military and\r\nthe railway staffs and, while avoiding the possibility of friction or\r\ncomplications, facilitate the handling of the military traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the account to be given in Chapter XVI. of \"Railways in the Boer\r\nWar,\" it will be shown that a like course was pursued in South Africa\r\nfor the duration of the campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMY MANOEUVRES OF 1912\r\n\r\nFurther evidence as to what the British railways were capable of\r\naccomplishing was afforded by the Army Manoeuvres in East Anglia\r\nin 1912. This event also constituted a much more severe test than\r\nthe Volunteer reviews of former days, since it meant not only the\r\nassembling, in the manoeuvre area, of four divisions of the Army and\r\nsome thousands of Territorials, but the transport, at short notice, and\r\nwithin a limited period, of many horses, guns, transport wagons, etc.,\r\ntogether with considerable quantities of stores. Certain sections of\r\nthe traffic were dealt with by the Great Northern and the London and\r\nNorth-Western Companies; but the bulk of it was handled by the Great\r\nEastern and was carried in nearly 200 troop trains, consisting in all\r\nof about 4,000 vehicles. Of these trains 50 per cent. started before\r\nor exactly to time, while the others were only a few minutes late in\r\nleaving the station. Such was the regularity and general efficiency with\r\nwhich the work of transportation was carried out that in the course of\r\nan address to the Generals, at Cambridge, his Majesty the King referred\r\nto the rapid concentration of troops by rail, without dislocating\r\nthe ordinary civilian traffic, as one of the special features of the\r\nmanoeuvres. The dispersal of the forces on the conclusion of the\r\nmanoeuvres was effected in a little over two days, and constituted\r\nanother smart piece of work.[34]\r\n\r\n\r\nA RAILWAYS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\r\n\r\nIn view of all such testimony and of all such actual achievements,\r\nthere was no reason to doubt that the railway companies, with their\r\ngreat resources in material and personnel, and with the excellence of\r\ntheir own organisation, would themselves be able to respond promptly\r\nand effectively to such demands as might be made upon them in a time of\r\nnational emergency.\r\n\r\nThere still remained, however, the singular fact that although, so\r\nfar back as 1871, the Government had acquired power of control over\r\nthe railways, in the event of an emergency arising, a period of forty\r\nyears had elapsed without any action being taken to create, even as\r\na precautionary measure, the administrative machinery by which that\r\ncontrol would be exercised by the State. Such machinery had been\r\nperfected in Germany, France, and other countries, but in England it\r\nhad still to be provided. Not only had section 16 of the Act of 1871\r\nremained practically a dead letter, but even the fact that it existed\r\ndid not seem to be known to so prominent a railway manager as Sir George\r\nFindlay when he wrote \"Working and Management of an English Railway\"\r\nand the article he contributed to the _United Service Magazine_ of\r\nApril, 1892, his assumption that the State would control the railways\r\nin time of war being based, not on the Act of 1871--which he failed to\r\nmention--but on the Act of 1888, which simply gives a right of priority\r\nto military traffic, under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, too, the draft scheme spoken of by Sir George Findlay,\r\nunder which the operation of the railways was to be entrusted, in case\r\nof emergency, to the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps, that body and,\r\nalso, the War Railway Council, continued to occupy a purely advisory\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nSo it was clearly desirable to supplement the recognized efficiency of\r\nthe railways themselves by the creation of a central executive body\r\nwhich, whenever the State assumed control of the railways, under the Act\r\nof 1871, would (1) secure the necessary co-operation between Government\r\ndepartments and the railway managements; (2) ensure the working of the\r\nvarious railway systems on a national basis; and (3) co-ordinate such\r\nvarious needs as naval and military movements to or from all parts of\r\nthe Kingdom; coal supply for the Fleet; transport of munitions; the\r\nrequirements of the civil population, etc.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for this machinery--which could not possibly be created at\r\na moment's notice--became still more apparent in the autumn of 1911, and\r\nsteps were taken to provide what was so obviously a missing link in the\r\nexisting organisation.\r\n\r\nThus it was that in 1912 the War Railway Council was succeeded by a\r\nRailways Executive Committee which, constituted of the general managers\r\nof leading railway companies, was to prepare plans \"with a view to\r\nfacilitate the working\" of the provisions of the Act of 1871, and would,\r\nalso, in the event of the Government assuming control over the railways\r\nof Great Britain, under the provisions of that Act, constitute the\r\nexecutive body for working them on behalf of the State, becoming the\r\nrecognised intermediary (1) for receiving the instructions of Government\r\ndepartments in respect to military and naval requirements; and (2) for\r\ntaking the necessary measures in order to give effect to them through\r\nthe individual companies, each of which, subject to the instructions\r\nit received from the Committee, would retain the management of its own\r\nline.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the principle thus adopted, it was through the\r\nRailways Executive Committee that the Government, subject to certain\r\nfinancial arrangements which need not be dealt with here, established\r\ntheir control over the railways of Great Britain on the outbreak of war\r\nin 1914, the announcement to this effect issued from the War Office,\r\nunder date August 4, stating:--\r\n\r\n    An Order in Council has been made under Section 16 of\r\n    the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, declaring that it is\r\n    expedient that the Government should have control over the\r\n    railroads in Great Britain. This control will be exercised\r\n    through an Executive Committee composed of general managers of\r\n    railways which has been formed for some time, and has prepared\r\n    plans with a view to facilitating the working of this Act.\r\n\r\nIn a notification issued by the Executive Committee, of which the\r\nofficial chairman was the President of the Board of Trade and the acting\r\nchairman was Mr. (now Sir Herbert A.) Walker, general manager of the\r\nLondon and South Western Railway, it was further stated:--\r\n\r\n    The control of the railways has been taken over by the\r\n    Government for the purpose of ensuring that the railways,\r\n    locomotives, rolling stock and staff shall be used as one\r\n    complete unit in the best interests of the State for the\r\n    movement of troops, stores and food supplies.... The staff on\r\n    each railway will remain under the same control as heretofore,\r\n    and will receive their instructions through the same channels as\r\n    in the past.\r\n\r\nAs eventually constituted, the Committee consisted of the following\r\ngeneral managers:--Mr. D. A. Matheson, Caledonian Railway; Sir Sam\r\nFay, Great Central Railway; Mr. C. H. Dent, Great Northern Railway;\r\nMr. F. Potter, Great Western Railway; Mr. Guy Calthrop, London and\r\nNorth Western Railway; Mr. J. A. F. Aspinall, Lancashire and Yorkshire\r\nRailway; Sir Herbert A. Walker, London and South Western Railway; Sir\r\nWilliam Forbes, London, Brighton and South Coast Railway; Sir Guy\r\nGranet, Midland Railway; Sir A. K. Butterworth, North Eastern Railway,\r\nand Mr. F. H. Dent, South Eastern and Chatham Railway, with Mr. Gilbert\r\nS. Szlumper as secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n1860 AND 1914\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the final outcome of a movement which, started in 1860,\r\nby individual effort, as the result of an expected invasion of England\r\nby France, was, in 1914, and after undergoing gradual though continuous\r\ndevelopment, to play an important part on behalf of the nation in\r\nhelping France herself, now England's cherished Ally, to resist the\r\ninvader of her own fair territory.\r\n\r\nWith what smoothness the transport of our troops was conducted cannot\r\nyet be told in detail; but the facts here narrated will show that the\r\nsuccess attained was mainly due to three all-important factors,--(1)\r\nthe efficiency of the railway organisation; (2) the willingness of the\r\nGovernment, on assuming control of the railways under the Act of 1871,\r\nto leave their management in the hands of railway men; and (3) the ready\r\nadoption, alike by the railway interests and by State departments,\r\nof the fundamental principle enforced by a succession of wars from\r\nthe American Civil War of 1861-65 downwards,--that in the conduct of\r\nmilitary rail transport there should be, in each of its various stages,\r\nintermediaries between the military and the railway technical elements,\r\nco-ordinating their mutual requirements, constituting the recognised\r\nand only channel for orders and instructions, and ensuring, as far as\r\nprudence, foresight and human skill can devise, the perfect working of\r\nso delicate and complicated an instrument as the railway machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAY TROOPS\r\n\r\nWhile Germany, inspired by the American example, had begun the creation\r\nof special bodies of Railway Troops in 1866, it was not until 1882 that\r\na like course was adopted in England. Prior to the last-mentioned year\r\nit was, possibly, thought that the labour branch of the Engineer and\r\nRailway Volunteer Staff Corps would suffice to meet requirements in\r\nregard to the destruction or the re-establishment of railways at home in\r\nthe event of invasion; but the arrangements of the Corps did not provide\r\nfor the supply of men to take up railway construction and operation on\r\nthe occasion of military expeditions to other countries.\r\n\r\nIt was this particular need that led, in the summer of 1882, to\r\nthe conversion of the 8th Company of Royal Engineers into the 8th\r\n(Railway) Company, R.E., the occasion therefore being the dispatch of\r\nan expeditionary force under Sir Garnet (afterwards Lord) Wolseley to\r\nEgypt, where the necessity for railway work of various kinds was likely\r\nto arise. This pioneer corps of British Railway Troops was formed of\r\nseven officers, one warrant officer, two buglers, and ninety-seven\r\nN.C.O.'s and sappers. So constituted, it was thought better adapted\r\nfor railway work under conditions of active service than a body of\r\ncivilian railwaymen would be. There certainly was the disadvantage that\r\nthose constituting the 8th were not then proficient in railway matters;\r\nbut, before they left, both officers and men were given the run of the\r\nLondon, Chatham and Dover Railway lines, and were there enabled to pick\r\nup what they could of railway working in the locomotive and traffic\r\ndepartments, while on the London and South Western and the South Eastern\r\nRailways they were initiated, as far as could be done in the time, into\r\nthe art of platelaying. The Corps took out to Egypt four small tank\r\nlocomotives; two first-class, two second-class and six third-class\r\ncarriages; forty cattle trucks; four brake vans; two travelling cranes;\r\ntwo breakdown vans, and five miles of permanent way, complete, with\r\naccessories, tools, etc. Excellent work was done in carrying on regular\r\ntrain services, repairing damaged track, etc., running an armoured\r\ntrain, constructing supplementary short lines, and conveying troops,\r\nsick and wounded, and stores, the practical utility of such an addition\r\nto the engineering forces of the Army being thus fully assured.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1885, the 10th Company, Royal Engineers, was converted\r\ninto the 10th (Railway) Company, and sent to Egypt to assist in the\r\nconstruction of the then contemplated Suakin-Berber line, to which\r\nfurther reference will be made in Chapter XV. Both companies also\r\nrendered good service in the South African War.\r\n\r\nAccording to the \"Manual of Military Railways,\" issued with Army Orders\r\ndated March 1st, 1889, the duties likely to be required from the Royal\r\nEngineers with regard to railways are as follows:-- (1) Laying, working,\r\nand maintaining a military line of railway between two places; (2)\r\nrestoring an existing line which has been damaged or destroyed by an\r\nenemy; (3) destroying an existing line as much as possible with a given\r\nnumber of men and in a specified time, and (4) working and maintaining\r\nan existing line. The \"Manual\" itself gave much technical information as\r\nto the construction, maintenance, destruction and working of railways.\r\nIt was re-issued by the War Office in 1898 as Part VI of \"Instruction\r\nin Military Engineering,\" and was stated to embody a portion of the\r\ncourse of instruction in railways at the school of Military Engineering,\r\nChatham. In the \"Manual of Military Engineering,\" issued by the General\r\nStaff of the War Office in 1905, instructions are given (Chap. XVII,\r\npars. 238-244) on the \"hasty demolition, without explosives,\" of\r\nrailways, stations, buildings, rolling stock, permanent way, water\r\nsupply, etc.; and in Chapter XXIII, \"Railways and Telegraphs,\" the\r\nstatement is made that--\r\n\r\n    The duties likely to be required of troops in the field with\r\n    regard to railways (apart from large railway schemes, for which\r\n    special arrangements would be necessary,) may be considered as\r\n    either temporary repairs or the laying of short lengths of line\r\n    to join up breaks, the construction of additional works, such\r\n    as platforms, etc., to adapt the line for military use, or the\r\n    demolition of an existing line.\r\n\r\nDetailed information is given, for the benefit of R.E. officers,\r\nconcerning railway construction, repair and reconstruction, and the\r\nmain principles on which such work should be carried out for military\r\npurposes are explained. The best system to adopt for the effecting of\r\nrapid repairs is said to be that of establishing construction trains.\r\n\"The reconstruction staff live in these trains, which rapidly advance\r\nalong the line as it is being repaired, conveying, also, the necessary\r\nmaterial.\"\r\n\r\nThe peace training[35] of the Companies includes: reconnaissance, survey\r\nand final location of a railway; laying out station yards; laying out\r\ndeviations; rapid laying of narrow-gauge \"military\" lines; construction\r\nof all kinds of railway bridges; signal installation; water supply;\r\nrepairs to telegraphs and telephones necessary for working construction\r\nlines; working of electric block instruments; fitting up armoured\r\ntrains; construction of temporary platforms, and working and maintenance\r\nof construction trains.\r\n\r\nInstruction in reconnaissance and survey work is given to officers\r\nwhile at head-quarters, and a certain number of N.C.O.'s and men are\r\nalso instructed in railway survey work. Parties, each commanded by an\r\nofficer, are sent to carry out a reconnaissance and final location of\r\na railway between two points about forty miles apart on the assumption\r\nthat it is an unmapped country, and complete maps and sections are\r\nprepared. The Companies have also undertaken the construction and\r\nmaintenance of the Woolmer Instructional Military Railway,--a 4 ft. 8½\r\nin. gauge military line, about six miles in length, connecting Bordon\r\n(London and South Western Railway) with Longmore Camp. All the plant\r\nnecessary for railway work and workshops for the repair of rolling stock\r\nare provided at Longmore.\r\n\r\nIn time of war the chief duties of a Railway Company, R.E., would be to\r\nsurvey, construct, repair and demolish railways and to work construction\r\nand armoured trains.\r\n\r\nIn the South African campaign, when the military had to operate the\r\nrailways of which they took possession in the enemy's country, some\r\ndifficulty was experienced in obtaining from the ranks of the Army a\r\nsufficient number of men capable of working the lines. As the result\r\nof these conditions, it was arranged, in 1903, between the War Office\r\nand certain of the British railway companies that the latter should\r\nafford facilities in their locomotive departments and workshops for the\r\ntraining of a number of non-commissioned officers and men as drivers,\r\nfiremen and mechanics, (capable of carrying out repairs,) in order to\r\nqualify them better for railway work in the field, in case of need. This\r\narrangement was carried out down to the outbreak of war in 1914. The\r\nperiod of training lasted either six or nine months. In order to avoid\r\nthe raising of any \"labour\" difficulties, no wages were given during\r\nthis period to Army men who were already receiving Army pay as soldiers,\r\nbut a bonus was granted to them by the railway companies, when they\r\nleft, on their obtaining from the head of the department to which they\r\nhad been attached a certificate of their efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRATEGICAL RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nThe subject of strategical railways will be dealt with, both generally\r\nand in special reference to their construction in Germany, in Chapter\r\nXVIII. In regard to Great Britain it may be said that the position as\r\nexplained by Sir George Findlay in his article in the _United Service\r\nMagazine_ for April, 1892, is that whilst Continental countries have\r\nbeen spending large sums of money on the building of strategical\r\nlines for the defence of their frontiers, (or, he might have added,\r\nfor the invasion, in some instances, of their neighbours' territory,)\r\nGreat Britain, more fortunate, possesses already a system of railways\r\nwhich, though constructed entirely by private enterprise, could not,\r\neven if they had been laid out with a view to national defence, \"have\r\nbeen better adapted for the purpose, since there are duplicated lines\r\ndirected from the great centres of population and of military activity\r\nupon every point of the coast, while there are lines skirting the coast\r\nin every direction, north, east, south and west.\"\r\n\r\nSome years ago there were certain critics who recommended the building\r\nof lines, for strategical purposes, along sections of our coast which\r\nthe ordinary railways did not directly serve; but the real necessity for\r\nsuch lines was questioned, the more so because the transport of troops\r\nby rail on such short-distance journeys as those that would have been\r\nhere in question might, with the marching to and from the railway and\r\nthe time occupied in entraining and detraining, take longer than if the\r\ntroops either marched all the way, or (in the event of there being only\r\na small force) if they went by motor vehicles to the coast.\r\n\r\nOne point that was, indeed, likely to arise in connection with the\r\nmovement of troops was the provision of facilities for their ready\r\ntransfer from one railway system to another, without change of carriage,\r\nwhen making cross-country journeys or travelling, for instance, from the\r\nNorth or the Midlands to ports in the South.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in France many such links were established, subsequent\r\nto the war of 1870-71, expressly for strategical reasons; but in\r\nGreat Britain a like result has been attained, apart from military\r\nconsiderations, from the fact that some years ago the different railway\r\ncompanies established physical connections between their different\r\nsystems with a view to the ready transfer of ordinary traffic. When,\r\ntherefore, the necessity arose for a speedy mobilisation, or for the\r\ntransport of troops from any part of Great Britain to any particular\r\nport for an overseas destination, the necessary facilities for through\r\njourneys by rail, in the shortest possible time, already existed.\r\n\r\nIn effect, the nearest approach to purely strategical lines in Great\r\nBritain is to be found, perhaps, in those which connect military camps\r\nwith the ordinary railways; yet, while these particular lines may\r\nhave been built to serve a military purpose, they approximate less to\r\nstrategical railways proper, as understood in Germany, than to branch\r\nlines and sidings constructed to meet the special needs of some large\r\nindustrial concern.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the attitude of Parliament and of British\r\nauthorities in general has not been sympathetic to suggestions of\r\nstrategical railways, even when proposals put forward have had the\r\nsupport of the War Office itself.\r\n\r\nThis tendency was well shown in connection with the Northern Junction\r\nRailway scheme which was inquired into by a Select Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons in 1913. Under the scheme in question, a railway was\r\nto be constructed from Brentford, on the west of London, to Wood Green,\r\non the north, passing through Acton, Ealing, Wembley Park, Hampstead\r\nand Finchley, and establishing connections with and between several of\r\nthe existing main-line systems. In this respect it compared with those\r\n\"outer circle\" railway systems which, as a further result of the war of\r\n1870-71, were expressly designed by the French Government for the better\r\ndefence of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Junction scheme was introduced to the Select Committee\r\nas one which, among other considerations, \"would be important from a\r\nmilitary point of view for moving troops from one point to another\r\nwithout taking them through London.\" Lieut.-General Sir J. S. Cowans,\r\nQuartermaster-General, a member of the Army Council responsible for\r\nthe movement of troops, and deputed by the Secretary for War to give\r\nevidence, said:\r\n\r\n    The proposed line would be a great advantage in time of\r\n    emergency if it was constructed in its entirety. The Army\r\n    Council felt that it would provide important routes between\r\n    the South of England and East Anglia and the North. At present\r\n    trains had to come from Aldershot to Clapham Junction by the\r\n    South-Western line, and be there broken up and sent over\r\n    congested City lines on to the Great Northern. By the proposed\r\n    line military trains could be handled without dividing them and\r\n    be transferred to the Great Northern or Great Eastern without\r\n    being sent over the congested City lines.\r\n\r\nStrong opposition was offered, however, on the ground that the\r\nconstruction of the line would do \"irreparable damage\" to the amenities\r\nof the Hampstead Garden Suburb; and, after a sitting which extended\r\nover several days, the Committee threw out the Bill, the Chairman\r\nsubsequently admitting that \"they had been influenced very largely by\r\nthe objection of the Hampstead Garden Suburb.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1914 the scheme was introduced afresh into the House of Commons, with\r\ncertain modifications, the proposed line of route no longer passing\r\nthrough the Hampstead Garden Suburb, though near to it. One member\r\nof the House said he had collaborated in promoting the Bill because\r\n\"he most earnestly believed this railway was of vital import to the\r\nmobilisation of our troops in time of emergency\"; but another declared\r\nthat the alleged military necessity for the railway was \"all fudge,\"\r\nwhile much was now said as to the pernicious effect the line would have\r\non the highly-desirable residential district of Finchley. In the result\r\nstrategical considerations were again set aside, and the House rejected\r\nthe Bill by a majority of seventy-seven.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] Colonel McMurdo had special qualifications for the post.\r\nBecoming a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army in October, 1853, he was\r\nAssistant-Adjutant-General at Dublin from May, 1854, to January,\r\n1855. On February 2, 1855, he was entrusted with the duties of\r\nDirector-General of the new Land-Transport Corps, and was sent out to\r\nthe Crimea, with the local rank of Colonel, to reorganize the transport\r\nservice, then in a deplorably defective condition. He is said to have\r\naccomplished this task with great energy and success. Before the close\r\nof the campaign his corps numbered 17,000 men, with 28,000 horses,\r\nmules, etc. He also took over the working of the pioneer military\r\nrailway in the Crimea. In 1857 the Land-Transport Corps was converted\r\ninto the Military Train, with Colonel McMurdo as Colonel-Commandant.\r\nEarly in 1860, when the Volunteer movement was assuming a permanent\r\ncharacter, Colonel McMurdo was appointed Inspector of Volunteers,\r\nand in June of the same year he became Inspector-General, a post he\r\nretained until January, 1865. He was chosen as Colonel of the Inns of\r\nCourt Volunteers on January 23, 1865, and his further appointment to\r\nthe post of Colonel of the newly-formed Engineer and Railway Volunteer\r\nStaff Corps followed, as stated above, in February, 1865. He was created\r\nK.C.B. in 1881 and G.C.B. in 1893. He died in 1894.\r\n\r\n[30] The names of present members of the Corps will be found in \"Hart's\r\nArmy List.\" Under the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act of 1907\r\nthe Corps became part of the Territorial Force, and the designation\r\n\"Volunteer\" was dropped from its title, which since that date has been\r\n\"The Engineer and Railway Staff Corps.\"\r\n\r\n[31] \"The Conveyance of Troops by Railway.\" By Col.

The traffic conveyed was, approximately, 514\r\nofficers, 14,552 men, 208 officers' horses, 2,474 troop horses, 25 guns,\r\n34 limbers, and 581 wagons and carts. \"The military authorities and the\r\nArmy contractors,\" it is said, \"expressed their pleasure at the manner\r\nin which the work was performed by the Company's staff.\"\r\n\r\n[35] \"General Principles, Organisation and Equipment of Royal\r\nEngineers,\" _Royal Engineers Journal_, February, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nMILITARY RAILWAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the expression \"military railways\" is meant lines of railways which,\r\nas distinct from commercial lines serving public purposes, have been\r\ndesigned expressly for military use. The fact that any line forming\r\npart of the ordinary railway system of the country is employed for the\r\nconveyance of troops either direct to the theatre of war or to some port\r\nfor embarkation therefrom does not constitute that line a \"military\"\r\nrailway, in the strict sense of the term, whatever the extent of its\r\nuse for military transport for the time being. Such line remains a\r\ncommercial railway, all the same, and the application to it of the\r\ndesignation \"military\" is erroneous.\r\n\r\nMilitary railways proper fall mainly into two groups--(1) \"field\"\r\nor \"siege\" railways, constructed on the theatre of war for moving\r\nheavy guns, platform materials, etc., to their position; conveying\r\nammunition and supplies to siege batteries, magazines, advanced\r\ntrenches or bombproofs; bringing up reinforcements rapidly in case of\r\na sortie; conveying working-parties to and from their work; removing\r\nsick and wounded to the rear, and other kindred purposes, the loads\r\nbeing generally hauled by animals, by gasoline motor or by men; and\r\n(2) \"supply\" railways, specially constructed to convey troops, stores,\r\netc., from the base to the front, in time of war, or from an ordinary\r\nmain-line railway to a military camp or depôt in time of peace, where\r\nlocal lines of railway are not available for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThese two main groups include various types of railways coming under\r\none or the other designation, and ranging from a very light portable\r\ntramway, put down at express speed to serve an emergency, and worked\r\nby small engines, mules or horses, to substantially built lines, of\r\nstandard gauge, designed both to be worked by locomotives and to carry\r\nthe largest possible number of troops or amount of freight.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the details of construction, equipment and operation of\r\na military railway vary from those of a commercial railway since the\r\none would be intended to serve only a specific and possibly temporary\r\npurpose, in the attainment of which the question of speed would be a\r\nsecondary consideration, whereas the other would require to assume\r\na permanent form, be capable of higher speeds, and afford adequate\r\nguarantee of safety for the public, by whom it would be used. The\r\nbuilding, also, of a military railway may be, and generally is, carried\r\nout by a corps of Railway Troops to which are specially delegated\r\nthe duties of laying, working, maintaining, repairing, restoring or\r\ndestroying railways; and, provided the desired lines were built with\r\nsufficient dispatch, and answered the desired purpose, the military\r\ncommanders who would alone be concerned might well be satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn many different ways the resort to military railways, whatever\r\ntheir particular type, has greatly extended the range of advantages\r\nto be gained from the application of rail-power to war. A full record\r\nof all that has been accomplished in this direction could hardly be\r\nattempted here; but a few typical examples of what has been done in this\r\ndirection--though not always with conspicuous success--may be offered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRIMEAN WAR\r\n\r\nThe earliest instance of a purely military railway being constructed\r\nto serve the purpose of a campaign occurred in the Crimean War; and,\r\nalthough the line then made would to-day be regarded as little more than\r\nan especially inefficient apology for a railway, it was looked upon at\r\nthe time as a remarkable innovation in warfare. It further established a\r\nprecedent destined to be widely followed in later years.\r\n\r\nBetween the camp of the allies at Sebastopol and their base of supplies\r\nat Balaklava the distance was only seven or eight miles; yet in the\r\nwinter of 1854-55 the fatigue parties sent for rations, clothing, fuel,\r\nhuts, ammunition and other necessaries were frequently no less than\r\ntwelve hours in doing the return journey. The reason was that during\r\nthe greater part of that time they were floundering in a sea of mud.\r\nThe soil of the Crimea is clay impregnated with salt, and, under the\r\ncombined influence of climatic conditions and heavy traffic, the route\r\nbetween camp and base had been converted into a perfect quagmire.\r\nHorses, mules and carts were, at first, alone available for transport\r\npurposes; but, although plenty of animals were to be obtained in the\r\nsurrounding country, only a limited number could be employed by reason\r\nof the lack of forage, a totally inadequate supply having been sent\r\nout from England. As for the animals that were used, their sufferings,\r\nas the result of those terrible journeys, their own shortage of food,\r\nand the effect of the intense cold on their half-starved bodies, were\r\nterrible. \"In the rear of each Division,\" says General Sir Edward\r\nHamley, in \"The War in the Crimea,\" \"a scanty group of miserable ponies\r\nand mules, whose backs never knew what it was to be quit of the saddle,\r\nshivered, and starved, and daily died.\" They died, also, on every\r\njourney to or from the base. The toil of going through the quagmire\r\neven for their own forage, or of bringing it back when they had got it,\r\nwas too great for them, and the whole line of route was marked by their\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nAs for the troops, they experienced great hardships owing to the\r\ninadequate supplies of provisions and fuel at the camp, although there\r\nmight be plenty of both at the base. Apart from the physical conditions\r\nof the roads, or apologies for roads, between the two points, the\r\ncampaign was begun without transport arrangements of any kind whatever.\r\nA transport corps formed for the British Army in 1799, under the title\r\nof the Royal Wagon Train, had been disbanded in 1833, and, whether from\r\nmotives of economy or because the need for war preparations in time\r\nof peace was not sufficiently appreciated, no other corps had been\r\ncreated to take its place. Hence the troops sent to the Crimea were\r\nrequired, at the outset, to look after the transport themselves, and in\r\nmany instances they even had to do the work of mules and horses. It was\r\nnot until January 24, 1855, that a Land Transport Corps, composed of\r\nvolunteers from various arms of the service, was raised by Royal Warrant\r\nand began to provide for a defect in the military organisation which\r\nhad, in the meantime, involved the allies, and especially the British,\r\nin severe privations owing to the frequent shortage of supplies.\r\nThe original intention to establish a depôt at head-quarters before\r\nSebastopol had had to be abandoned because of the hopelessness of any\r\nattempt to get a sufficient surplus of provisions to form a store.\r\n\r\nSuch were the conditions that the pioneer military railway was designed\r\nto remedy. Built, at a very slow rate, by English contractors, who\r\narrived at the Crimea with their men and material during the month\r\nof January, 1855, the line was a single-track one, with a 4 feet 8½\r\ninch gauge. For the first two miles from Balaklava it was worked by a\r\nlocomotive. Then the trucks were drawn up an incline, eight at a time,\r\nby a stationary engine. Six horses next drew two trucks at a time up\r\nanother incline. After this came a fairly level piece of road, followed\r\nby two gullies where each wagon was detached in succession and made to\r\nrun down one side of the gully and up the other by its own momentum.\r\nThen horses were again attached to the trucks and so drew them, finally,\r\nto the end of the line on the Upland.\r\n\r\nFive locomotives, of from 12 to 18 tons weight, were provided, and\r\nthere were about forty ordinary side-tip ballast wagons--all entirely\r\nunsuitable for use on a military railway.\r\n\r\nAt first the men belonging to the contractors' staff--navvies and\r\nothers--were entrusted with the working of the line. The question had\r\nbeen raised as to whether their services should not be made use of in\r\nother directions, as well. On their being sent out from England the\r\nidea was entertained that they might construct trenches and batteries,\r\nin addition to building the railway, and there was a suggestion that\r\nthey should, also, join the siege parties in the attack on Sebastopol.\r\nIn order to test the question (as recorded by Major-General Whitworth\r\nPorter, in his \"History of the Corps of Royal Engineers\"), Sir John\r\nBurgoyne wrote to Mr. Beattie, principal engineer of the Railway\r\nDepartment, asking if he would approve of an invitation being given to\r\nthe men to undergo such training as would qualify them to defend any\r\nposition in which they might happen to be. In his answer Mr. Beattie\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n    The subject of your letter was very fully and anxiously\r\n    discussed in London before I left, and it was determined _not_\r\n    to arm the men. They were considered too valuable to be used as\r\n    soldiers, and were distinctly told that they would not be called\r\n    upon to fight.\r\n\r\nTheir value, however, did not stand the test it underwent when they\r\nwere called on to work the railway they had built. They were found to\r\nbe lacking in any sense of discipline; they repeatedly struck work when\r\ntheir services were most urgently needed, and they had to be got rid of\r\naccordingly. They were replaced by men from the Army Works Corps and the\r\nLand Transport Corps, then in operation in the Crimea, and the members\r\nof the new staff--constituting a disciplined force--worked admirably.\r\nMajor Powell, who became traffic manager of the line in March, 1855,\r\nand chief superintendent in the following July, has said concerning\r\nthem[36]:--\r\n\r\n    Many lost their lives in the execution of their duty. When\r\n    I required them to work night and day to throw forward supplies\r\n    for the great struggle--the capture of Sebastopol--several of\r\n    them remained seventy-two hours continuously at work.\r\n\r\nThe quantities of ammunition and stores which could be carried were\r\nbelow the requirements of the troops engaged in the siege operations;\r\nbut during the last bombardment of Sebastopol--when the line was worked\r\ncontinuously, night and day, by a staff increased to about 1,000 men, of\r\nwhom 400 were Turks--the transport effected rose from 200 tons a day,\r\nthe limit attained under operation by the undisciplined navvies, to\r\n700 tons. The line also did excellent work on the re-embarkment of the\r\ntroops at the end of the campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\nIn the American War of Succession, the existing lines of railway\r\nwere supplemented in various instances by \"surface railroads,\" which\r\nconsisted of rails and sleepers laid on the ordinary ground without\r\nany preparation of a proper road bed, yet serving a useful purpose,\r\nnotwithstanding the rough and ready way in which they were put together.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABYSSINIAN CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\nHow a railway specially constructed for the purpose may assist a\r\nmilitary expedition in the prosecution of a \"little war\" in an\r\nuncivilised country, practically devoid of roads, and offering great\r\nphysical difficulties, was shown on the occasion of the British Campaign\r\nin Abyssinia in 1867-68; though the circumstances under which the\r\nline in question was built were not in themselves creditable to the\r\nauthorities concerned.\r\n\r\nSent to effect the release of the British prisoners whom King Theodore\r\nwas keeping in captivity at Magdala, the expedition under Sir Robert\r\nNapier (afterwards Lord Napier of Magdala) entered upon what was to be\r\nquite as much an engineering as a military exploit. Not only was Magdala\r\n300 miles from Annesley Bay, the base of operations on the Red Sea, but\r\nit stood, as a hill fortress, on a plateau more than 9,000 feet above\r\nthe sea-level. To reach it meant the construction of roads in three\r\nsections. The first, which, in parts, had to be cut in the mountain\r\nside, rose to a height of 7,400 feet in 63 miles; the second allowed\r\nof no more than a cart road, and the third and final stage was a mere\r\nmountain track where the only transport possible was that of mules or\r\nelephants.\r\n\r\nWhen, in October, 1867, the advance Brigade landed at Zoulla, the port\r\nin Annesley Bay from which the advance inland was to be made, they took\r\nwith them the materials for some tramway lines intended to connect\r\ntwo landing piers with the depôts it was proposed to establish a mile\r\ninland. In November these plans were altered in favour of a line of\r\nrailway, twelve miles in length, from the landing-place to Koomayleh, at\r\nthe entrance of the Soroo Pass, the route to be taken by the expedition\r\non its journey to the Abyssinian highlands. All the necessary plant\r\nwas to be supplied by the Government of Bombay, who also undertook to\r\nprovide the labour; but it was the middle of January, 1868, before a\r\nreal start could be made with the work.\r\n\r\nEven then, as told by Lieut. Willans, R.E.,[37] who took part in the\r\nexpedition, the progress made was extremely slow. The rails obtained\r\nfrom different railway companies in India were of five different\r\npatterns, of odd lengths, and varying in weight from 30 lb. to 65 lb.\r\na yard. Some of them had been in use many years on the harbour works\r\nat Karachi, had been taken up and laid down several times, and had,\r\nalso, been bent to fit sharp curves or cut to suit the original line.\r\nSome single-flanged rails had been fitted in the Government workshops\r\nat Bombay with fish-plates and bolts; but the holes in the plates and\r\nrails were not at uniform distances, and the bolts fitted the holes so\r\ntightly as to allow of no play. Then, when the rails arrived, no spikes\r\ncame with them, and without spikes they could not be laid. When the\r\nspikes followed, it was found that the augurs for boring holes in the\r\nsleepers had been left at Bombay, to come on by another ship; though\r\nthis particular difficulty was met by the artisans of the 23rd Punjab\r\nPioneer Regiment making augurs for themselves.\r\n\r\nIf the rails gave much trouble--and even when they had been laid it was\r\nno unusual thing for them to break between two sleepers and throw the\r\nengine off the line--the locomotives and rolling stock caused still\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nSix locomotives were shipped from Bombay; but, owing to the great\r\ndifficulty in landing and the labour involved in putting them together,\r\nonly four were used. Of these, one was a tank engine which, although\r\njust turned out from the railway workshops at Bombay, required new\r\ndriving wheels after it had been running a fortnight. Another came with\r\nworn-out boiler tubes, and these had to be replaced at Zoulla. The\r\ntwo others, tank engines with only four wheels each, had previously\r\nseen many years' service at Karachi. All the engines were very light,\r\nweighing with coal and water from 16 to 20 tons each. The best of them\r\ncould do no more than draw fifteen small loaded trucks up an incline of\r\none in sixty.\r\n\r\nThe sixty wagons sent were ordinary trolleys having no springs, no\r\nspring buffers and no grease boxes. Their axle-boxes were of cast iron,\r\nand wore out within a fortnight, owing to the driving sand. As the\r\nrailway came into use, every truck was loaded to its fullest capacity,\r\nand the combination of this weight with the jarring and oscillation on a\r\nvery rough line led either to the breaking of the coupling chains or to\r\nthe coupling bars being pulled from the wagons at starting. When fresh\r\ncoupling chains were asked for it was found that the boxes containing\r\nthem had either been left behind at Bombay or were buried beneath\r\nseveral hundred tons of other supplies on board ship. At least forty per\r\ncent. of the trucks were either constantly under repair or had to be put\r\naside as unfit for use. In May a number of open wagons with springs and\r\nspring buffers arrived from Bombay. Some of these were converted into\r\npassenger carriages.\r\n\r\nDifficulties arose in other directions, besides.\r\n\r\nThe plant forwarded was adapted to the Indian standard gauge of 5 feet\r\n6 inches, and was heavy and difficult to handle, especially under the\r\ntroublesome conditions of landing. To-day, of course, a narrow-gauge\r\nrailway, easily dealt with, would be employed in circumstances such as\r\nthose of the Abyssinian expedition.\r\n\r\nThe Indian natives who had been sent in the first instance to construct\r\nthe line were found unsuitable, and had to be replaced by gangs of\r\nChinese picked up in Bombay. The latter worked well and gave no trouble.\r\n\r\nThe country through which the line was laid was timberless, if not,\r\nalso, practically waterless. Wells had to be sunk for the water wanted\r\nfor the locomotives and the working-parties.\r\n\r\nThe heat was excessive. The temperature at times was 180 degrees Fahr.\r\nin the sun. English navvies could not have made the line at all.\r\n\r\nThe two piers where the incoming vessels could alone be unloaded got\r\nso congested with traffic that it was only with the greatest trouble\r\nrailway material could be landed.\r\n\r\nUse began to be made of the line as soon as any of it was ready, and the\r\ntraffic at the shore end at once became so heavy that it was difficult\r\nto get materials and supplies through to the construction parties at\r\nthe other end. Officers, also, who should have been superintending the\r\nconstruction had to devote a good deal of time, instead, to details of\r\noperation, or to looking after the repairs of rolling stock.\r\n\r\nIn all these circumstances one cannot be surprised at the slow rate of\r\nprogress made. One may, rather, wonder that the line got built at all.\r\nAs it was, four months were spent on eleven miles of railway, or a total\r\nof twelve miles including sidings. There remained still another mile or\r\nso to be built when, at the end of April, news arrived that the object\r\nof the expedition had been attained, and that Magdala had fallen. It was\r\nthen decided not to complete the line, but to devote all energies to\r\npreparing for the heavy traffic to be dealt with in the conveyance of\r\ntroops, baggage and stores on the return journey.\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of May to the middle of June the resources of the line\r\nwere severely taxed; but a great improvement had been made in the\r\nworking arrangements, and a railway which had involved so much trouble\r\nin the making was eventually found to be of great practical service.\r\nLieutenant Willans says of it:--\r\n\r\n    The Abyssinian railway was a great success, if one may gauge\r\n    it by the amount of assistance it gave to the expedition, by\r\n    the celerity and dispatch with which, by its aid, stores were\r\n    landed and brought up to the store sheds, and by the rapidity\r\n    and ease with which the troops and their baggage were brought\r\n    back and re-embarked at once....\r\n\r\n    As an auxiliary to the expedition, and as an additional\r\n    means of transport, no one who had anything to do in connection\r\n    with it can have doubted its extreme utility.\r\n\r\nFaulty, therefore, as had been the conditions under which the line\r\nwas constructed, the results nevertheless established definitely the\r\nprinciple that, in such campaigns as the one in Abyssinia, military\r\nrailways might serve an extremely useful purpose in facilitating the\r\ntransport of troops and supplies.\r\n\r\nThe Abyssinian experiences did, however, further show the desirability\r\nof any country likely to find itself in a position requiring the\r\nconstruction of military railways--as an aid to wars small or\r\ngreat--creating in advance an organisation designed to enable it, as far\r\nas possible, to meet promptly whatever emergency might arise, without\r\nthe risk of having to deal with defective material, unsatisfactory\r\nlabour, and administrative mismanagement.\r\n\r\nThe same lesson was to be enforced by other expeditions in which\r\nEngland has taken part, and, down to the period when improvements in\r\nour system--or lack of system--began to be effected, there was much\r\nscope for criticism as to the way in which military railways, designed\r\nto facilitate operations undertaken in countries having a lack of\r\ncommunications, had been either constructed or worked. Writing, in\r\n1882, in the \"Professional Papers\" of the Royal Engineers (Chatham) on\r\n\"Railways for Military Communication in the Field,\" Col. J. P. Maquay,\r\nR.E., observed in regard to what had been the experiences to that date:--\r\n\r\n    In most of the wars that England has undertaken during\r\n    the past thirty years, attempts have been made to construct\r\n    railways for the transport of stores and materials from the base\r\n    of operations. This base must necessarily be on the sea coast\r\n    for a country situated as England is. These railways have not\r\n    been successful chiefly because, when war had broken out, such\r\n    material was hastily got together as seemed most suitable to\r\n    the occasion; and, further, the construction of these lines was\r\n    not carried out on any system. It is not surprising, therefore,\r\n    that our military railways were never completed in time to be\r\n    of much use to the troops they were intended to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCO-GERMAN WAR\r\n\r\nIn the Franco-German War of 1870-71 the Germans constructed two military\r\nrailways--(1) a line, twenty-two miles in length, connecting Remilly, on\r\nthe Saarbrück Railway, with Pont à Mousson, on the Metz-Frouard line;\r\nand (2) a loop line, three miles long, passing round the tunnel at\r\nNanteuil, blown up by the French.\r\n\r\nSpecial interest attached to these two lines inasmuch as they were the\r\nresult of construction work done, not in anticipation of a war, or even\r\nimmediately preceding hostilities, but during the course of an active\r\ncampaign. In addition to this, they afforded an opportunity for showing\r\nwhat Prussia could do, under pressure, with the Construction Corps she\r\nhad formed in order, among other things, to meet just such contingencies\r\nas those that now arose.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war the Prussian General Staff had (according to\r\nRüstow) assumed that Metz would offer a prolonged resistance, and that\r\nthe defenders would be certain to make an attempt to interrupt the rail\r\ncommunication between Germany and her troops in the field. To meet the\r\nposition which might thus be created, it was decided to build from Pont\r\nà Mousson to Remilly a field railway which, avoiding Metz, would link up\r\nat Remilly with the line proceeding thence to Saarbrück, and so ensure\r\nthe maintenance of direct rail communication to and from Germany. On\r\nAugust 14, 1870, the day of the rearguard action at Borny, the survey\r\nand the levelling of the ground were begun, and three days later a start\r\nwas made with the construction. Altogether some 4,200 men were employed\r\non the work, namely, 400 belonging to two Field Railway Companies; 800\r\nforming four Fortress Pioneer Companies, and about 3,000 miners from the\r\ncolliery districts of Saarbrück who had been thrown out of work owing to\r\nthe war and accepted employment on the railway. The building corps had\r\nat their disposal a park of 330 wagons and other vehicles, and patrol\r\nand requisition duties were performed for them by a squadron of Cavalry.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that so considerable a force was available for the\r\npurpose, the work of building the twenty-two miles of railway took\r\nforty-eight days, the line not being ready for operation until October\r\n4. This was in no way a great achievement, and it did not compare\r\nfavourably with much that was done by the Federal Construction Corps\r\nemployed in the American War of Secession. It is true that the\r\nirregularities of the ground were such as to render necessary numerous\r\ncuttings and embankments, and that two bridges and two viaducts had\r\nto be provided; but the cuttings were only about 3 feet deep, and the\r\nembankments were only 5 feet high, except near one of the viaducts,\r\nwhere they were 10 feet high. The viaducts and bridges were of timber,\r\nwith spans of about 16 feet. The building of the line was, therefore, in\r\nno way a formidable undertaking, from an engineering point of view.\r\n\r\nNot only, however, did it take over 4,000 men nearly fifty days to make\r\ntwenty-two miles of line, but the work had been done in such a way that\r\nwhen the autumn rains came on the track settled in many places; traffic\r\non the lines became very dangerous; one of the bridges was washed away\r\nby the floods, and almost as many men had to be put on to do repairs as\r\nhad previously been employed for the construction. Traffic of a very\r\nmoderate description--each locomotive drawing only four wagons at a\r\ntime--was carried on for just twenty-six days, and then, happily for the\r\nengineers concerned, the developments in and around Metz rendered the\r\nline no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nHow the restoration of the traffic interrupted through the explosion of\r\nFrench mines in the tunnel at Nanteuil occupied from September 17 to\r\nNovember 22 has already been told on page 128.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSO-TURKISH WAR\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of one English military critic, what short lines were\r\nmade in the Franco-German War \"were neither so speedily constructed\r\nnor so successful in result as to encourage the idea that lines of any\r\nlength could be made during a campaign\"; but a different impression\r\nis to be derived from the story of what was accomplished in the same\r\ndirection in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78.\r\n\r\nRussia planned her campaign against Turkey in the hope and expectation\r\nthat it would be short, sharp and decisive. She started her mobilisation\r\nin good time, that is to say, in November, 1876, although she did\r\nnot declare war until April 24, 1877. Making the mistake, however,\r\nof despising her foe, she anticipated no serious opposition from the\r\nTurks, but expected, rather, to paralyse them by a rapid advance, have a\r\ntriumphal march to Constantinople, secure the desired safeguards for the\r\nChristians in Turkey, and see the war over before the end of the summer.\r\n\r\nOne reason why Russia specially desired to bring the campaign to so\r\nearly a conclusion lay in the deficient and precarious nature of the\r\nrail communication. Under a convention which had been agreed to with\r\nRumania on April 16, 1877, Russia was to have a free passage for her\r\ntroops through that country. She was, also, to have the use of the\r\nRumanian railways and of all their transport facilities. But the only\r\nline then running through Rumania was one that went from Galatz, on the\r\nRusso-Rumanian frontier, to Bucharest, and thence (with a branch to\r\nSlatina) to Giurgevo, on the Danube, where it connected with a Bulgarian\r\nline from Rustchuk, on the south of the river, to Varna, the Turkish\r\nbase of supplies on the Black Sea. Not only was the Rumanian railway\r\nsystem thus limited in extent, but the lines had been indifferently\r\nconstructed, they were badly maintained, and they had an inadequate\r\npersonnel together with an insufficiency both of rolling stock and of\r\nterminal facilities. Still further, the fact that the Russian railways\r\nhad a broader gauge than the railways of Rumania (among other European\r\ncountries) caused great delay in the transfer, at the frontier, from the\r\none system to the other, not alone of 200,000 men, but of the 850 field\r\nand 400 siege guns, of the ammunition, and of much other material the\r\ntroops required to take with them. The alternative to dependence on the\r\nrailway was a resort to roads impassable in wet weather.\r\n\r\nWhat really caused the Russian plans to miscarry, however, was the\r\nobstinate defence of Plevna by Osman Pasha, who took up his position\r\nthere on July 19, subjected the Russians to successive repulses, and did\r\nnot capitulate until December 10, the siege costing the Russians 55,000\r\nmen and the Rumanians 10,000.\r\n\r\nWhen it was realised that the check at Plevna rendered certain a\r\nprolongation of the campaign, Russia set about the construction of\r\na series of new lines of railway during the course of the war. The\r\nprincipal lines thus taken in hand were:--\r\n\r\n1. A line in Russia, from Bender, on the Dniester, to Galatz,\r\nestablishing direct communication between the Odessa railways and the\r\nRumanian frontier, and affording improved facilities for the sending of\r\nreinforcements to the seat of war.\r\n\r\n2. A line from Fratesti, on the Bucharest-Giurgevo Railway, to Simnitza,\r\nthe point on the north bank of the Danube where, on the night of June\r\n26-7, the Russians built the bridge which enabled them to cross the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n3. A line from Sistova, on the south side of the Danube, to Tirnova\r\n(Bulgaria), situate about thirty miles south-east of Plevna, and about\r\ntwenty-five north of the Shipka Pass.\r\n\r\nOf these three lines the construction of the first, 189 miles in\r\nlength, was begun at the end of July, 1877. The original intention\r\nwas to build a railway to serve the purposes of the war only; but the\r\nconclusion that ulterior strategical and commercial purposes would\r\nalike be served by linking up Odessa with the Rumanian frontier led\r\nto the building of a railway likely to be of permanent usefulness.\r\nThe line was a single-track one, with a sufficient number of stations\r\nand passing places to allow of the running of seven trains in each\r\ndirection in the twenty-four hours. The construction, carried out by\r\ncontract, involved the building of a number of timber bridges and the\r\nprovision of several embankments, one of which was over three miles in\r\nlength. Great difficulties were experienced in regard to labour, and\r\nespecially by reason of the refusal of the men to work either on Sundays\r\nor on their numerous saints' days. Trains were, nevertheless, running\r\non the line within 100 days of the construction being started, and this\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the number of actual working days had been\r\nonly fifty-eight. Whereas, therefore, the Germans had, in 1870, with the\r\nhelp of a Construction Corps over 4,000 strong, taken forty-eight days\r\nto build twenty-two miles of railway between Pont à Mousson and Remilly,\r\nthe Russians in 1877 built, by contract, 189 miles of railway in just\r\nover double the same period.\r\n\r\nA railway from Fratesti to Simnitza had become indispensable inasmuch\r\nas the main line of communication for the Russian Army could not be\r\ncontinued for an indefinite period along the forty miles of defective\r\nroads--speedily worn out by the heavy traffic--which separated the\r\nBucharest-Giurgevo line from the bridge built across the Danube. The\r\nonly important earthwork necessary was an embankment a mile and a half\r\nlong and fourteen feet high. The bridges to be provided included one\r\nof 420 feet and two of 210 feet each. In this instance the troubles\r\nexperienced were due to the difficulty in getting the necessary\r\nmaterials for the work of construction owing partly to the existing\r\nRumanian lines being blocked with military traffic, and partly to the\r\nstate of the roads and to the use of all available draught horses for\r\nArmy transport purposes. There could thus be no great celerity shown in\r\nconstruction, and the forty miles of railway, begun in the middle of\r\nSeptember, were, in fact, not ready for working until the beginning of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nLike difficulties were experienced, though to a still more acute degree,\r\nin regard to the Sistova-Tirnova line, the length of which was to be\r\nseventy-five miles; and here only the earthworks could be finished\r\nbefore the end of the campaign.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, had been accomplished during the time the war was in\r\nprogress was (1) the completion of 229 miles of new railway, and the\r\nmaking of the road-bed for another seventy-five miles, together with the\r\ncarrying out of a number of minor railway works; (2) the acquisition,\r\nby purchase in different countries, of 120 locomotives and 2,150 wagons\r\nand trucks, all new, and (3) the provision of a steam railway ferry\r\nacross the Danube.[38]\r\n\r\nSo the development of the rail-power principle in warfare was\r\ncarried still further by this construction, during the course of the\r\nRusso-Turkish conflict, of a greater length of railways, designed for\r\nmilitary use, than had ever been built under like conditions before.\r\nThe world gained a fresh lesson as to the importance of the rôle played\r\nby railways in war, and it was offered, also, a striking example of\r\nwhat could be done in the way of rapidly providing them in a time of\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it had to be remembered that, of the three railways in\r\nquestion, the one which included 189 miles out of the total 229 miles\r\nbuilt was constructed on Russian territory where there was no danger of\r\ninterruption by the enemy, while the delays which occurred with the two\r\nother lines, owing to the congestion of traffic, under war conditions,\r\non existing railways depended upon for the supply of materials, seemed\r\nto point (1) to the risk that might, from this cause, be run if the\r\nbuilding of lines necessary or desirable in the interests of some\r\nprospective campaign were left until the outbreak of hostilities, and\r\n(2) to the wisdom of constructing all such lines, as far as necessary\r\nand practicable, in time of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUDAN\r\n\r\nIf we turn now to the Sudan, we gain examples of military railways\r\nwhich, designed for the purposes of war, and constructed, in part,\r\nduring the progress of active hostilities, first rendered great services\r\nin facilitating the conquest of a vast area, and then developed into a\r\nsystem of Government railways operated, in turn, for the purposes of\r\npeace, and accomplishing results as conspicuously successful in the\r\nlatter direction as they had previously done in the former.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that Saïd Pasha was Viceroy of Egypt (1854-63) there\r\nwas brought forward a scheme for the linking up of Egypt and the Sudan\r\nby means of a single line of railway from Cairo to Khartoum, with a\r\nbranch to Massowa, on the Red Sea. It was an ambitious proposal, and,\r\nif it could have been carried into effect, the opening up of the Sudan\r\nto civilisation, by means of an iron road, might have altered the\r\nwhole subsequent history of that much-suffering land. But the cost was\r\nregarded as prohibitive, and the scheme was abandoned for a time, to\r\nbe revived, however, in a modified form in 1871, when Ismail Pasha was\r\nKhedive. It was then proposed that the line should start at Wady Halfa\r\nand be continued to Matemmeh (Shendy), situate about 100 miles north of\r\nKhartoum--a total distance of 558 miles. In 1875 a beginning was made\r\nwith the building of this railway, which was to consist of a single\r\nline, with a gauge of 3 feet 6 inches, and was to be made with 50-lb.\r\nrails and 7-ft. sleepers; but when, in 1877, after an expenditure of\r\nabout £400,000, the railway had been carried no farther than Sarras,\r\nthirty-three and a half miles from the starting-point, it was stopped\r\nfor lack of funds.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1884 the British expedition to Khartoum, where General\r\nGordon was endeavouring to maintain his position against the Mahdi's\r\nfollowers, was resolved upon, and it was then decided to extend the\r\nSudan Railway beyond the point already reached, at Sarras, in order to\r\nfacilitate still further the journey of the troops along the valley of\r\nthe Nile, which had been selected as the route of the expedition.\r\n\r\nPlatelaying for the extension was begun in September by a party of\r\nEnglish and Egyptian infantry and native labourers, afterwards joined\r\nby the 4th Battalion Egyptian Army and the 8th (Railway) Company of the\r\nRoyal Engineers. While, however, materials previously stored at Sarras\r\nwere found to be still available, the trucks containing rails, etc.,\r\nfor the extension work had to be pushed by hand from Sarras to railhead\r\nowing to the absence of engines; sleepers were carried on the backs of\r\ncamels, of which 300 were employed for the purpose, and the coolie work\r\nwas entrusted to 700 native labourers, mainly old men and boys, most\r\nof whom had deserted by the end of October, when further platelaying\r\nwas discontinued. By that time the extension works had reached the\r\nthirty-ninth mile, and the line from Sarras to this point was opened on\r\nDecember 4.\r\n\r\nFollowing on the fall of Khartoum and the death of Gordon in January,\r\n1885, came the decision to extend the line to Firket (103 miles), in\r\nview of a then projected further campaign in the autumn of that year.\r\nThe extension was sanctioned towards the end of February; fifty-two\r\nmiles of permanent way were ordered from England; 300 platelayers\r\nand railway mechanics were obtained from India, to supplement the\r\nconstruction forces already available; and on August 7 the extension was\r\ncompleted as far as Akasha (87 miles).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, there had been a change of policy which affected\r\nthe whole situation. On the return of the expeditionary force to\r\nKorti (situate at the southern extremity of the great Nile bend), the\r\nwhole of the country to the south thereof passed under the control of\r\nthe Dervishes; and the British Government, reluctant at that time to\r\nenter on the formidable task of reconquest, decided that no further\r\nmilitary operations should be taken in hand, and that the Sudan must be\r\ndefinitely abandoned. Orders were accordingly given by Lord Wolseley in\r\nMay, 1885, for the withdrawal of the troops from all stations south of\r\nDongola, which itself was abandoned on June 15, the retreat continuing\r\nas far as Akasha. Beyond this point, therefore, platelaying for the\r\nproposed railway extension was not carried, although the formation\r\nlevels had been completed to Firket.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the British retreat was continued to Wady Halfa, which then\r\nbecame the southern frontier of Egypt, the railway extension thence to\r\nAkasha, together with all posts to the south of Wady Halfa, being also\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nExcellent service had, nevertheless, been rendered by the railway, as\r\nfar as it was carried.\r\n\r\nOperation of the line had been taken over by the 8th (Railway) Company,\r\nR.E., who, at the outset, had at their disposal only five more or less\r\ndecrepit locomotives, fifty open trucks, five covered goods vans, and\r\nsix brake vans. The troops were conveyed in the open trucks, and by the\r\nend of 1884 all the stores for the opening of the campaign had been\r\npassed up. During the course of 1885 additional locomotives and rolling\r\nstock were obtained from the Cape.\r\n\r\nSumming up the work done on the Sudan Military Railway for the Nile\r\nExpedition of 1884-5, Lieut. M. Nathan, R.E.,[39] says that it included\r\n(1) the repair and maintenance of thirty-three and a half miles of\r\nexisting railway; (2) the construction of fifty-three and a half\r\nmiles of new line through a nearly waterless desert, with no means of\r\ndistributing material except the line itself; (3) the transport, for\r\nthe most part with limited and indifferent stock, of about 9,000 troops\r\nround the worst part of the second cataract when going up the river, and\r\nround nearly the whole of it when coming down; and (4) the carriage of\r\n40,000 tons for an average distance of thirty-six and a half miles.\r\n\r\nAs against what had thus been achieved in the Nile Valley must be set a\r\nfailure on the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the fall of Khartoum in January, 1885, the British Government\r\nfirst decided on an extension of the Nile Valley Railway, they further\r\nresolved on the building of a military railway from Suakin to Berber,\r\non the Nile, in order to have a second line of communication available\r\nfor Lord Wolseley's Army; and an Anglo-Indian force was sent to Suakin,\r\nunder the command of General Sir Gerald Graham, in order, first, to\r\ndefeat the Dervishes in the Eastern Sudan, and then to protect the\r\nconstruction of the proposed railway. Such a line would obviously have\r\nbeen of great strategical value to a Nile expeditionary force; but\r\nthe attempt to build it broke down owing, in part, to the defective\r\nnature of the organisation resorted to, though still more to the active\r\nopposition of the enemy.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew Clarke, Inspector-General of Fortifications, had from the\r\nfirst advocated that the line should be supplied and laid by the\r\nmilitary engineering strength then available; but he was over-ruled, and\r\nthe work was given to an English firm of contractors in the expectation,\r\nas Major-General Whitworth Porter tells, in volume two of the \"History\r\nof the Corps of Royal Engineers,\" \"that the necessary material would be\r\nsupplied more readily, and in shorter time, through civilian agency.\"\r\nIt was, however, decided to send the 10th (Railway) Company of Royal\r\nEngineers both to carry out some local works in the neighbourhood of\r\nSuakin and to assist the contractors in the longer undertaking; and\r\nthis military element was strengthened, not only by a force of Indian\r\ncoolies, but, also, by the addition of thirty-nine members of Engineer\r\nVolunteer Corps in England who had enlisted for the campaign, all having\r\nhad experience in trades qualifying them for railway work.[40] There was\r\nthus practically a dual system, workable, in the opinion of Sir Andrew\r\nClarke, \"only by a species of compromise which was both unscientific and\r\nuneconomical.\"\r\n\r\nAs for interruptions by the Dervishes, these took the form of constant\r\nattacks both on the line under construction and on the workers. Several\r\nactions were fought, and at Tofrik, near Suakin, the British sustained a\r\nserious loss of life. Posts were erected as the work slowly progressed,\r\nand the bullet-proof train mentioned on page 76 was used for patrolling\r\nthe line at night; but in face of all the difficulties experienced the\r\nwork was definitely abandoned when only twenty miles of the intended\r\nrailway had been completed. The troops were recalled in June, 1885,\r\nthe railway material not used was brought back to England, and a line\r\nlinking up Suakin (and Port Sudan) with Berber, via Atbara Junction, was\r\nnot finally opened until 1906.\r\n\r\nReverting to the Nile Valley Railway, it is gratifying to be able to\r\nsay that the success already spoken of as having been attained in this\r\ndirection was but a prelude to still more important developments that\r\nwere to follow.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the carrying out of schemes which the Dervishes were known to\r\nbe preparing for an invasion of Egypt, the British Government decided,\r\nearly in 1896, to allow Egypt to resume occupation of the country along\r\nthe Nile Valley abandoned at the time of the withdrawal in 1885, and\r\non March 12, 1896, Sir Herbert (now Earl) Kitchener, who had succeeded\r\nto the command of the Egyptian army in 1892, received instructions\r\nto advance to the south from Wady Halfa. Akasha, the point to which\r\nthe Nile Valley Railway had been built, was occupied on March 20, the\r\nDervishes retreating to Firket.\r\n\r\nAs a means towards realising the objects of the expedition, Sir Herbert\r\nKitchener resolved to continue the railway along the Nile Valley to\r\nKerma; but this meant the construction of practically a new railway,\r\nsince the Dervishes had torn up over fifty of the eighty-seven miles of\r\nthe original line between Wady Halfa and Akasha, burning the sleepers\r\nand twisting the rails, while the remainder of the line was in such\r\na condition that it required relaying. The work of construction was\r\nentrusted to a staff of Royal Engineers operating under Lieut. (now\r\nMajor-General Sir E. Percy C.) Girouard, and it was pushed forward with\r\ngreat energy, the line being urgently required for the forwarding of\r\nstores to the front, and especially so on account of the impediments to\r\nnavigation along the Nile due to the cataracts.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the railway, so far as it had then been restored, Sir\r\nHerbert Kitchener concentrated a force of 9,000 men at Akasha, and\r\nearly in June he made a successful advance on Firket. The Dervishes\r\nretired to Dongola; but it was thought prudent, before following them\r\nup, to await a further extension of the railway. This was completed as\r\nfar as Kosha, 116 miles from Wady Halfa, by August 4, 1896. Three weeks\r\nlater some heavy rains, lasting three days, were the cause of floods\r\nwhich, in a few hours, destroyed twelve miles of the newly-constructed\r\nline. The repairs were completed in about a week, but in the same month\r\nthere was an outbreak of cholera which carried off a large number of the\r\nworking staff.\r\n\r\nUtilising the railway as far as Kosha, Sir Herbert Kitchener\r\nconcentrated the whole of his force at Fereig, on the north of the\r\nKaibar cataract, and from thence a further advance was made to Dongola,\r\nwhich place the Dervishes made no attempt to defend.\r\n\r\nThe immediate purpose of the expedition had thus been attained; but, in\r\nthe meantime, a further campaign had been resolved upon for the purpose\r\nof breaking down the power of the Khalifa and effecting the conquest\r\nof Khartoum. To this end the railway was continued another hundred\r\nmiles, from Kosha to Kerma, which point was reached in May, 1897. Some\r\n216 miles of railway had thus been completed in about thirteen months,\r\nnotwithstanding interruptions which had led to very little progress\r\nbeing made during five months of this period, and notwithstanding, also,\r\nthe fact that construction work had to be carried on simultaneously with\r\nthe transport of troops and stores so far as the line had been completed.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, Kerma was reached, Sir Herbert Kitchener instructed\r\nthe staff of the Royal Engineers to make a survey of the Nubian Desert\r\nwith a view to seeing whether or not it would be practicable to build\r\nan alternative line of railway across it from Wady Halfa direct to Abu\r\nHamed (a distance of 232 miles), thus giving a direct route to Khartoum.\r\n\r\nA survey carried out at the end of 1896 showed that the work was not\r\nlikely to present any unsurmountable engineering difficulties, and that\r\nthe absence of water could be overcome by the sinking of wells. The\r\nonly doubtful point was whether construction could be carried through\r\nwithout interruption by a still active enemy.\r\n\r\nIt was seen that the proposed desert line was likely to be of far\r\ngreater importance, both strategically and politically, than a\r\ncontinuation of the Wady Halfa-Kerma line round the remainder of the\r\nNile bend. The cutting off of this bend altogether would confer a great\r\nadvantage on the Expeditionary Force. It was thus resolved to build the\r\nline, to run the risk of attacks by the enemy, and to push construction\r\nforward with the greatest energy.\r\n\r\nA start was made with the work on May 15, 1897, the staff which had\r\nbeen engaged on the Nile Valley line to Kerma returning to Wady Halfa\r\nin order to take the desert line in hand. By the end of July, 115 of\r\nthe 232 miles of line had been completed, and Sir Herbert Kitchener,\r\nutilising the railway which had already been constructed to Kerma, then\r\nsent a force along the Nile Valley to effect the capture of Abu Hamed.\r\nThis was accomplished on August 7, and the constructors of the desert\r\nline were thus enabled to resume their work with greater security and\r\neven accelerated speed. Abu Hamed was reached on October 31, 1897,\r\nthe two extreme points of the great Nile bend being thus brought into\r\ncommunication by a direct line of railway. The construction of the\r\n232 miles of track had been accomplished in five and a half months,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the work was carried on during the hottest\r\ntime of the year. An average length of a mile and a quarter of line\r\nwas laid per day, while on one day in October a maximum of three and a\r\nquarter miles was attained. So well, too, had the work been done that\r\ntrains carrying 200 tons of stores, drawn by engines weighing, without\r\ntender, fifty tons, were taken safely across the desert at a speed of\r\ntwenty-five miles per hour.\r\n\r\nFrom Abu Hamed the line was at once pushed on in the direction of\r\nBerber, and its value from a military point of view was speedily to\r\nbe proved. Receiving information, towards the end of 1897, that the\r\nDervishes were planning an attack on Berber, Sir Herbert Kitchener sent\r\nto Cairo for a Brigade of British troops to join with the Egyptian\r\nforces then at Berber in opposing this advance, and the Brigade arrived\r\nin January, 1898, having travelled by the desert railway not only to Abu\r\nHamed, but to a point twenty miles farther south, which then constituted\r\nrailhead. Early in March the Anglo-Egyptian Army was concentrated\r\nbetween Berber and the Atbara river, and the battle of Atbara, fought in\r\nthe following month, led to the complete annihilation of the forces sent\r\nby the Khalifa to drive the Egyptians out of Berber.\r\n\r\nThere was known to be still an army of 50,000 men in Omdurman, at the\r\ncommand of the Khalifa; but it was considered desirable, before any\r\nfurther advance was made by the Anglo-Egyptian forces, to await not\r\nonly the completion of the railway to the Atbara but the rise, also, of\r\nthe Nile, so that the river would be available for the bringing up of\r\nsteamers and gunboats to take part in the attack on Omdurman.\r\n\r\nOnce more, therefore, Lieut. Girouard and his staff had to make the most\r\nstrenuous efforts, and these were again so successful that the line was\r\ncarried to the Atbara early in July. It was of the greatest service in\r\nfacilitating the concentration of an Anglo-Egyptian Army, 22,000 strong,\r\nat Wad Hamed, and the victory of Omdurman, on September 2, 1898--when\r\n20,000 of the enemy were killed or wounded--followed by the occupation\r\nof Khartoum, meant the overthrow of the Mahdi, the final reconquest of\r\nthe Sudan, and the gaining of a further great triumph in the cause of\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nIn the account of these events which he gives in volume three of the\r\n\"History of the Corps of the Royal Engineers,\" Colonel Sir Charles M.\r\nWatson says concerning this ultimate outcome of a rebellion which had\r\nlasted, altogether, for a period of eighteen years:--\r\n\r\n    Lord Kitchener, of course, by the skill and determination\r\n    with which he conducted the operations to a successful\r\n    termination, deserves the principal credit for the happy\r\n    conclusion of the campaign. But it must not be forgotten that\r\n    a large part of the work was carried out by the officers of\r\n    the Royal Engineers, especially those who had charge of the\r\n    construction and maintenance of that railway without which, it\r\n    is fair to say, the campaign could not have been conducted at\r\n    all.\r\n\r\nThe final triumph was the more gratifying because, although the desert\r\nrailway had contributed so materially thereto, dependence upon it had\r\nnot been without an element of serious risk which cannot be told better\r\nthan in the words of Lord Cromer, in his book on \"Modern Egypt\":--\r\n\r\n    The interval which elapsed between the occupation of Abu\r\n    Hamed and the final advance on Khartoum was a period of much\r\n    anxiety. Sir Herbert Kitchener's force depended entirely on\r\n    the desert railway for its supplies. I was rather haunted with\r\n    the idea that some European adventurer, of the type familiar\r\n    in India a century and more ago, might turn up at Khartoum and\r\n    advise the Dervishes to make frequent raids across the Nile\r\n    below Abu Hamed with a view to cutting the communication of the\r\n    Anglo-Egyptian force with Wady Halfa. This was unquestionably\r\n    the right military operation to have undertaken; neither, I\r\n    think, would it have been very difficult of accomplishment.\r\n    Fortunately the Dervishes ... failed to take advantage of the\r\n    opportunity presented to them. To myself it was a great relief\r\n    when the period of suspense was over. I do not think that the\r\n    somewhat perilous position in which Sir Herbert Kitchener's army\r\n    was undoubtedly placed for some time was at all realised by the\r\n    public in general.\r\n\r\nWithin about two months of the battle of Omdurman the plans were made\r\nfor a further extension of the railway from Atbara to Khartoum, and\r\nKhartoum North was reached on the last day of 1899. The construction\r\nof a bridge over the Blue Nile subsequently allowed of trains running\r\ndirect into Khartoum.\r\n\r\nTo-day this same railway has been carried a distance of 430 miles south\r\nof Khartoum. It continues along the Blue Nile to Sennah, where it turns\r\nto the westward, crosses the White Nile at Kosti, and has its terminus\r\nat El Obeid, the capital of Kordofan Province. What this means is that\r\nan enormous expanse of territory has been opened up both to civilisation\r\nand to commercial development.\r\n\r\nApart from the important gum trade of which El Obeid is the centre, the\r\nSudan is pre-eminently a pastoral country. The number of its cattle,\r\nsheep and goats is estimated at \"several millions\"; it has thousands of\r\nsquare miles available for cotton-growing, already carried on there for\r\ncenturies, and it has wide possibilities in other directions, besides;\r\nthough stock-raising and cotton cultivation should alone suffice to\r\nensure for the Sudan a future of great wealth and commercial importance.\r\n\r\nBeyond the districts immediately served by the extension there are\r\nothers which are to be brought into touch with the railway, either\r\ndirect or via the Nile, by means of a \"roads system\" linking up towns\r\nand villages with a number of highways extending to all the frontiers of\r\nthe Sudan. On these roads and highways motor traction will, it is hoped,\r\nbe gradually substituted for transport animals, the troubles caused by\r\nthe tsetse fly and other pests being thus avoided.\r\n\r\nThe scheme here in question is certainly an ambitious one, considering\r\nthat the Sudan covers an area of 1,000,000 square miles, and is equal\r\nin extent to the whole of British India; but already the outlook is\r\nmost promising. For twelve years before its rescue from heathenism by\r\nthe British and Egyptian forces in 1898, Khartoum, which formerly had\r\na population of 50,000, was represented by the mass of ruins to which\r\nit had been reduced by order of the Khalifa. To-day it is a large,\r\nbeautiful, and well-built city, possessed of a Governor-General's\r\npalace, cathedrals, a mosque, schools, hospitals, hotels, broad streets,\r\npublic gardens, boulevards, imposing business premises, a good water\r\nsupply, electric light, tramways, ferries, and other essentials of a\r\ncapital city of the most progressive type. Khartoum itself has now about\r\n30,000 inhabitants; in Khartoum North, on the other side of the Blue\r\nNile, there are 20,000, and in Omdurman 70,000, a total of 120,000 for\r\nthe three sister cities. Not only, also, have the natives, once living\r\nunder the terror of their oppressors, settled down to peaceful pursuits,\r\nbut many thousands of immigrants have come into the Sudan from West\r\nAfrica (a striking testimony of the confidence felt by native tribes\r\nin the justice and security of British rule), while great expansion\r\nhas taken place in the commercial interests of the Sudan and more\r\nespecially in the export of cattle and sheep.\r\n\r\nIn the bringing about of these developments, affecting the peace and\r\nprosperity of so huge a country and of so many millions of people,\r\nthe Sudan Military Railways have played a leading part. They rendered\r\npossible, in the first instance, the conquest of the Sudan, and then\r\n(save for the now abandoned line from Wady Halfa to Kerma) they became,\r\nwith their extensions and improvements, the system of \"Sudan Government\r\nRailways,\" having their branches to-day both from Atbara to Port Sudan\r\nand Suakin, on the Red Sea, and from Abu Hamed to Kareima, on the south\r\nside of the great Nile bend, whence there is free communication by water\r\nto the third cataract at Kerma. Concurrently, also, with the carrying\r\nout of the railway extension schemes, and in order to make greater\r\nprovision for the prospective increase of traffic, 460 miles of the line\r\nnorth of Khartoum were relaid with 75-lb. rails, in place of the 50-lb.\r\nrails originally used, and the whole of the track from Khartoum to El\r\nObeid was also laid with the heavier rails.\r\n\r\nSo we are enabled to regard military railways from still another point\r\nof view--that, namely, in which they may develop into lines of permanent\r\ncommunication and promote the blessings of peace and security no less\r\nthan afford unquestionable advantages in the prosecution of war. Other\r\nexamples of a similar kind might be offered from the history of British\r\nrule in Africa; but the record of what has been accomplished in the\r\nSudan may suffice to establish the further claim here presented as to\r\nthe varied purposes that military railways may serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] See lecture by Capt.

As it was the Volunteers worked well with\r\ntheir comrades of the Royal Engineers.... It may be considered the first\r\nexperiment in associating the Volunteer force with a combatant branch of\r\nthe Regular Army on active service.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nRAILWAYS IN THE BOER WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe South African campaign of 1899-1902 afforded to Great Britain and\r\nto British Imperial interests their greatest, most instructive, and,\r\nalso, their most anxious experiences, down to that time, not only of\r\nthe services railways can render in the conduct of war, but of the\r\ndifficulties and complications which may result from their employment,\r\nand especially from dependence on them for the purposes of military\r\ntransport; though, in the result, the services so rendered were a\r\nmaterial factor in the success by which the military operations carried\r\nout by the British forces were crowned.\r\n\r\nWhen the Boers declared war in October, 1899, the various railway\r\nsystems, working in direct communication with one another, in South\r\nAfrica, had a total length of 4,268 miles, namely, British South Africa,\r\n3,267; the Transvaal, 918; the Orange Free State, 388; and in Portuguese\r\nterritory, 55. These railways consisted of single-track, narrow-gauge\r\nlines (3 feet 6 inches), never designed for such heavy traffic as the\r\ntransport of an army and all its impedimenta would involve; but it was\r\nobvious from the first that they must needs play a part of paramount\r\nimportance in the campaign. Independently of all that was involved in\r\nthe conveyance of troops, munitions, supplies, etc., from England to the\r\nCape, there was the consideration that from Cape Town, the principal\r\nbase of our forces, to Pretoria, their eventual objective, the distance\r\nwas 1,040 miles. From Port Elizabeth it was 740 miles, and from Durban\r\n511 miles. Journeys such as these could be made only by rail, and\r\nthere was seen to be an imperative need, not only for the railways\r\nthemselves, but for an organisation which would, among other things,\r\nsuperintend military rail-transport in order to ensure efficiency in\r\nthe movement of troops, stores, etc., and, also, provide for the speedy\r\nrepair or rebuilding of damaged lines as well as for the operation of\r\nlines taken possession of in the captured territory.\r\n\r\nIn view of the uncertainty of events in the Transvaal, and as a\r\nprecautionary measure, the 8th (Railway) Company, Royal Engineers, was\r\nsent out to the Cape in July, 1899; and when, subsequently, the dispatch\r\nof an Army Corps was being arranged by the British Government, it was\r\ndecided to create a _Department of Military Railways_, of which Major\r\nGirouard, R.E. (now Major-General Sir E. Percy C. Girouard, K.C.M.G.),\r\nwho had rendered such valuable services in connection with military\r\nrailways in the Sudan, and was then President of the Egyptian Railway\r\nAdministration, was put in charge as \"Director of Railways for the South\r\nAfrican Field Force.\" A number of other Royal Engineer officers who had\r\nhad experience of railway work in India and other parts of the British\r\nEmpire were selected to serve as Assistant Directors or staff officers\r\nin various capacities, and the 10th (Railway) Company, Royal Engineers,\r\nwith the 6th, 20th, 31st and 42nd Fortress Companies, were sent to join\r\nthe 8th (Railway) Company in the carrying out of railway work.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANISATION AND CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe creation of this Department of Military Railways for South Africa\r\ncarried still further the development of those questions of organisation\r\nand control which, as we have seen, had already raised important issues\r\nin the United States, in Germany, and in France.\r\n\r\nAccording to the official \"History of the War in South Africa,\r\n1899-1902,\" the Director and his staff were (1) to be the intermediaries\r\nbetween the Army and the technical working administration of the\r\nrailway; (2) to see that the ordinary working of the railway was carried\r\non in such a manner as to ensure the greatest military efficiency;\r\nand (3) to satisfy the demands of the Army on the railway without\r\ndisorganising the working of the railway system as a whole.\r\n\r\n\"In war,\" the official \"History\" further declares, \"these services are\r\nessential, for the officers of a civil railway administration cannot\r\ndiscriminate between the demands of the various branches and departments\r\nof the Army, or class them in the order of urgency.\" This is perfectly\r\ntrue of the civil railway administration, and it is only what could be\r\nexpected of railwaymen who, while competent to discharge their ordinary\r\nrailway duties, might not be well versed in military matters, and ought\r\nnot to be left with the responsibility of deciding between the possibly\r\nconflicting orders of different military commanders.\r\n\r\nAll the same, there was another side to the question; and this is dealt\r\nwith by Sir Percy Girouard in his \"History of the Railways during the\r\nWar in South Africa,\" wherein he says, in regard to rail transport\r\nconditions in time of war:--\r\n\r\n    Military commanders who have not previously studied the\r\n    working of a railway attempt to seize and work the portion of\r\n    line nearest to them, regardless of the remainder of the system.\r\n    They often look upon trucks as another form of commissariat\r\n    wagon which may be kept loaded for an indefinite period. They\r\n    expect trains to stop and off-load, or load, on the main line.\r\n    They like to have a number of trains ready, either loaded or\r\n    unloaded, in case they should be required. They are apt to\r\n    give orders for large entrainments and detrainments to be\r\n    carried out at any part of the line, regardless of the railway\r\n    facilities at that point, although perhaps a suitable place is\r\n    within reasonable distance. Frequently they have been known\r\n    to countermand their orders for entrainments, heedless of the\r\n    fact that, once arrangements have been made to concentrate\r\n    rolling stock on a certain place, it takes time to alter these\r\n    arrangements, and is sure to cause confusion. Many of them\r\n    expect railway accommodation for troops to be on a liberal\r\n    scale, and consider that there is no necessity, when close to a\r\n    railway, to make any effort to cut down baggage and stores....\r\n\r\n    Commandants of posts on the line, which are very often\r\n    placed at railway stations, are inclined to think that, because\r\n    they are called \"station commandants,\" it means that they are\r\n    in charge of the railway station, and can give orders to railway\r\n    officials as to traffic and other matters....\r\n\r\n    Civil railway officials have been heard to say that attacks\r\n    by the enemy are not nearly so disturbing to traffic as the\r\n    arrival of a friendly General with his force.\r\n\r\nIt was under these circumstances that Sir Percy Girouard saw from the\r\nfirst the necessity for having in South Africa, for the duration of\r\nthe war, a staff of officers whose business it would be, as he himself\r\ndefines their duties, (_a_) to keep the military commanders fully\r\ninformed of the capacity and possibilities of the railway, and to convey\r\ntheir orders and requests to the civil railway staff; and (_b_) to\r\nprotect the civil railway administration from interference by military\r\ncommanders and commandants of posts; in fact, to act as intermediaries\r\nbetween the army and the civil railway officials.\r\n\r\nIn arriving at this conclusion Sir Percy was especially impressed by\r\nthe rail transport experiences of France in her war with Prussia in\r\n1870-1; and in his Report he gives a digest of Jacqmin's facts and\r\nrecommendations by way of further justifying the step that he himself\r\ntook. He thought it absolutely necessary that the staff of the Director\r\nof Railways should be paramount on the railway, and that no officer\r\nshould be able to give any orders to railway staff officers or other\r\nrailway officials unless fighting was actually proceeding at that spot.\r\n\"This,\" he adds, \"was the system adopted with great success by the\r\nGermans, the want of which caused such chaos on the French railways, and\r\nthe correctness of which has been entirely established by the experience\r\nof this war. It is not too much to say that, unless it had been adopted\r\nin South Africa, the chaos would have been past belief.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Military Railway Controlling-Staff_ created, in accordance with\r\nthese principles and policy, to co-operate with the technical working\r\nstaff under the Director of Railways, was constituted as follows:--\r\n\r\nI. An _Assistant-Director of Railways_ for Cape Colony, who was on\r\nthe staff both of the Director of Railways and on that of the General\r\nOfficer Commanding Lines of Communication, Cape Colony. His business\r\nit was to co-operate with the General Traffic Manager of the Cape\r\nGovernment Railway, in whose office he was given accommodation. In\r\nthis dual capacity it was his duty to inform both the General Officer\r\nCommanding and the Director as to the traffic capacities of the\r\nrailways; to take the orders of the G.O.C. while advising him as to the\r\nbest method of carrying them out; to inform the railway officials what\r\nwas required, and, Sir Percy adds, in giving these details, \"to protect\r\nthem from interference by unauthorised military officers.\" It was the\r\nduty, also, of the Assistant-Director to see that proper regulations\r\nwere issued to the Army for (_a_) the efficient conduct of entrainments\r\nand detrainments; (_b_) the forwarding of stores, and (_c_) the keeping\r\nof financial accounts in respect to the use made of the lines for\r\nmilitary purposes. As between the General Officer Commanding and the\r\nChief Traffic Manager, the Assistant-Director of Railways was the sole\r\nchannel of communication.\r\n\r\nII. Four _Deputy-Assistant-Directors_, undertaking similar duties over\r\nparticular sections of the railway system.\r\n\r\nIII. _Railway Staff Officers_, located at leading stations to\r\nsuperintend all important movements, and constituting the only means of\r\ncommunication between the Army and the stationmasters. The latter were\r\nto take orders in respect to military requirements from no one else,\r\nand were, in turn, to be protected by the railway staff officers from\r\ninterference with by other officers having no authority to give them\r\ndirect orders.\r\n\r\nThe defective step in the scheme, as originally planned, was in respect\r\nto the railway staff officers, who, of all those constituting the\r\nMilitary Railway Controlling Staff, were, under Army Regulations, on\r\nthe staff of officers commanding lines of communication and thus not\r\ncontrolled by the Director of Railways. The officers in question, though\r\ncharged with the duty of looking after entrainments, detrainments, etc.,\r\nwere in no way to interfere with the railway staff in the shunting\r\nor marshalling of trains or in regard to the traffic arrangements\r\ngenerally. For this reason the framers of the Army Regulations had\r\nassumed that there was no need for the railway staff officers to have\r\nany knowledge of railway operation, or to be under the control of others\r\nwho did possess such knowledge.\r\n\r\nAfter the annexation of the Orange Free State railways, the Chief\r\nof the Staff agreed that the railway staff officers in that State\r\nshould be under the orders of the Director of Railways through his\r\nDeputy-Assistant-Directors; and a like course was adopted shortly\r\nafterwards in respect to the railway staff officers in Cape Colony. In\r\nthis way an undivided chain of responsibility was secured, affording\r\na much greater guarantee of efficiency alike in control and in actual\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Deputy-Assistant-Directors, Sir Percy Girouard says\r\nthey were found to be of great benefit to the railway officials, who\r\nappreciated their work and laboured in hearty co-operation with them;\r\nthough they experienced difficulty in establishing their position with\r\nthe Generals and Staff officers, to whom the arrangement was an entire\r\nnovelty, and one they did not at first understand.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance the principle of military control applied\r\nspecially to the lines in Cape Colony, those in Natal being still\r\noperated by the Natal Government Railway Department, with certain\r\nassistance in the matter of repairs; though after eighteen months of\r\nwar, the military transport system first established in Cape Colony\r\nbecame uniform throughout British South Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPORT CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nThe need for the elaborate organisation thus brought into existence was\r\nall the greater because of the difficulties by which those responsible\r\nfor the conduct of military transport were faced.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1899, considerable portions of the lines both in Cape\r\nColony and in Natal were in the possession of the Boers, so that, beyond\r\na certain distance, the British would have to fight for every mile\r\nof railway before they could make use of it. After, also, regaining\r\npossession of the lines on British territory controlled by the Boers,\r\nthey would require first to capture and then to operate those on the\r\nenemy's territory; and in each case they would have to be prepared to\r\nrepair the damage the enemy would be certain to do to the lines in order\r\nto prevent their use by the advancing forces. Meanwhile the traffic\r\nmust be kept open, as far as possible, for the conveyance of troops and\r\nstores to the theatre of war and for the carrying out of such strategic\r\nmovements as the requirements of the military situation might render\r\nnecessary, adequate protection of the lines being meanwhile assured.\r\nThere were, in fact, occasions when the whole issue of the campaign\r\nseemed to turn upon the question as to whether or not the British could\r\neither secure possession of the railways or, alternatively, repair them\r\nas fast, more or less, as the enemy could demolish them.\r\n\r\nAlthough, again, so elaborate a system of organisation had been\r\narranged, there was much that required to be done to adapt it to the\r\nconditions of African warfare. Initial mistakes had to be remedied;\r\nold evils reappeared in new forms; regulations had to be made or\r\nmodified according to experiences gained; and, while there was at no\r\ntime any general failure of transport, there certainly were partial\r\nfailures. Not only was there an inadequate supply of trucks, partly\r\nbecause of the considerable number in the Boer States at the time of\r\nthe declaration of war and partly because of the number locked up in\r\nKimberley and Mafeking, but trucks were kept loaded when they should\r\nhave been promptly unloaded and released for service elsewhere; lines\r\nwere seriously blocked at critical moments by these loaded trucks, while\r\nchaos in certain large troop movements was only avoided owing to the\r\ncontrol of Cape Town facilities by the Director's staff and to the fact\r\nthat the Deputy-Assistant-Directors of Railways were enabled to have\r\nspecial officers at all important points.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE SYSTEM WORKED\r\n\r\nAs regards the _operation of the railways_ during the war Sir Percy\r\nGirouard says:--\r\n\r\n    Although not, perhaps, so much a matter of railway as of\r\n    general staff administration, a word should be said as to the\r\n    methods whereby the very limited resources of the single line of\r\n    railway communication were allotted to ensure an equal attention\r\n    to the requirements of the Army as a whole.\r\n\r\n    The allocation of railway facilities was reserved strictly\r\n    to the Chief of Staff, without whose order, in each case,\r\n    nothing could pass by rail towards the front. The number of\r\n    trains, or, more accurately, the number of trucks which could\r\n    be hauled daily in the \"up\" direction, being communicated by\r\n    the railway authorities to Lord Kitchener, he placed a number,\r\n    liable to vary from day to day, at the disposal of the supply\r\n    and remount departments, either generally for the maintenance of\r\n    their depôts or for specific traffic.\r\n\r\n    The number reserved for hospital, ordnance, engineer and\r\n    special stores was even more closely calculated, and the demands\r\n    of these departments had to be submitted for approval in the\r\n    utmost detail. All authorisations were passed to the railway\r\n    representatives at Headquarters, whose business it was to\r\n    notify when the total of such orders outstanding for dispatch\r\n    from the advanced base was exceeding the accommodation which\r\n    could be provided within a reasonable time under the scheme of\r\n    proportion in force for the time being. In such case the issue\r\n    of permits fell temporarily into abeyance, or the outstanding\r\n    list was revised to accord with the necessities of the moment.\r\n    No truck could be loaded and no troops dispatched by rail\r\n    without such authority, with the single exception of details\r\n    and small parties, who were invariably made to travel upon\r\n    the loaded supply trucks. Proposed troop movements by rail\r\n    requiring separate accommodation had to be carefully considered\r\n    in view of the supply traffic they would displace, and, when\r\n    time permitted, were generally made by road. It was this system\r\n    alone which co-ordinated the railway requirements of the various\r\n    departments and did so much to falsify previously accepted\r\n    figures as to the limits of the fighting force which could be\r\n    maintained by a single line of railway.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIAL MILITARY RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nFollowing the questions which arose as to the working of railways on\r\nBritish territory within the sphere of the military operations came\r\nthose concerning the _railways taken from the enemy_ in the Boer States,\r\nand converted into a system of Imperial Military Railways for which the\r\nDepartment also became responsible.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Bloemfontein led to that place becoming the base of\r\nsupplies for an army of 35,000 men, likely to increase to 100,000, while\r\neventually the Imperial Military Railways included 1,130 miles of line.\r\nEfficient operation thus became a matter of grave importance, and the\r\ntask to be accomplished was one of considerable magnitude, especially\r\nconsidering that a staff for the working of the system had to be\r\ncreated. In the traffic and locomotive departments alone no fewer than\r\n3,000 white workers were needed.\r\n\r\nMany of the employés of the Netherlands Railway Company were kept on,\r\neven at the risk of their showing hostility to the British; but the\r\nnumber who thus made themselves available was quite inadequate, even\r\nif they could all have been trusted. The Cape Government Railways were\r\ndrawn on to the fullest possible extent for workers; the Railway and\r\nthe Fortress Companies of the Royal Engineers in South Africa were\r\nemployed in operating the lines; railwaymen in the Special Railway\r\nReserve in England were sent for, and, of the remaining posts, from\r\n800 to 1,000 were filled--the approval of the Commander-in-Chief being\r\nfirst obtained--by inviting soldiers and reservists serving in the Army\r\nwho had had experience of railway work in civil life to join the staff\r\nof the Imperial Military Railways, pay at Royal Engineer rates being\r\nguaranteed to them. Positions of the least importance were filled by\r\nmen who had had no previous railway experience at all. Railway staff\r\nofficers were also obtained mainly from among the troops; though many\r\neven of these, being unfamiliar with the details of railway operation,\r\nhad to be taught their special duties before they could attempt to\r\ndischarge them.\r\n\r\nOn September 30, 1900, the staff employed on the Imperial Military\r\nRailways comprised close on 18,000 officers and men. From the time these\r\nrailways were brought under the control of the British forces to August\r\n31, 1900, they carried 177,000 passengers, 86,000 animals, and 520,000\r\ntons of goods.\r\n\r\nAs the moral to be drawn from his experiences in having to create, under\r\ncircumstances of exceptional difficulty, a staff for the operation of\r\nrailways captured from the enemy, Sir Percy Girouard says:--\r\n\r\n    The South African campaign has fully shown the necessity of\r\n    having a number of traffic employés registered in peace time,\r\n    who are paid a small retaining fee which will render them liable\r\n    to be called out in case of war at home or abroad. The want of\r\n    this system forced the Director of Railways in South Africa to\r\n    employ a large number of men who had been employed by the enemy,\r\n    and who could not be relied on, and also to withdraw from the\r\n    fighting-line a large number of soldiers with railway experience\r\n    prior to enlistment; and he was compelled to work the railways\r\n    with this heterogeneous mass of individuals whose qualifications\r\n    were unknown. The amount of correspondence entailed over\r\n    conditions of service, pay, transfer, etc., of all these men,\r\n    coming from different parts of South Africa and from different\r\n    units, was tremendous. The registration system would also\r\n    arrange for the men on the railways being subject to Military\r\n    Law, the necessity for which has been clearly proved.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPAIR OF RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nWhilst all these arrangements in regard to operation and transport\r\nwere thus being perfected, the need had arisen for an equally complete\r\norganisation in another direction, that, namely, of providing for the\r\n_repair or restoration of railway lines_ damaged or destroyed by the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nSince the American Civil War the art of railway demolition had\r\nmade considerable advance by reason of the use for this purpose of\r\ndynamite--an agency which was now to be employed very freely by the\r\nBoers. With dynamite they easily blew up the bridges, or material\r\nportions thereof; they destroyed the track for considerable distances\r\nby the simple process of exploding dynamite cartridges under alternate\r\nrail-joints; they wrecked culverts, pumps and water tanks, and they\r\neffectively damaged locomotives which they had not time or opportunity\r\nto remove. Then, among other things, they derailed engines and trucks\r\nby means of mines; they caused obstructions by throwing down into the\r\nrailway cuttings boulders of up to two or three tons in weight; they cut\r\ntelegraph lines; they removed or smashed up instruments and batteries at\r\nrailway stations; they wrecked the stations; they burned many railway\r\ntrucks, or otherwise rendered them useless; they set fire to stacks of\r\nfuel, and, when dynamite cartridges were not available, they deprived\r\nthe locomotives of their vital parts and tore up considerable lengths of\r\nrails.\r\n\r\nBy December, 1899, it had become evident that the Railway Companies\r\nand the Fortress Companies of the Royal Engineers, sent out to the\r\nCape and brought up to their fullest strength, would be unequal to the\r\nrequirements of the prospective situation. The Railway Corps thus formed\r\nwas, accordingly, augmented by a Railway Pioneer Regiment, composed of\r\nminers, artisans and labourers who had been employed at Cape Town or\r\nJohannesburg, volunteers from the ranks of the Army (preference being\r\ngiven to those already possessed of experience in railway work), and\r\nemployés of the Orange Free State Railway. Some Field Railway Sections,\r\ncreated to form the nucleus of a staff to take over the working of\r\nrailways in the enemy's country became construction parties, doing\r\nrepairs only, and having no control of traffic except at railhead. In\r\naddition to all these, a large number of natives were engaged through\r\nNative Labour Depôts opened at De Aar, Bloemfontein and Johannesburg,\r\nthe number so employed at any one time attaining a maximum of about\r\n20,000.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal that the Boers\r\ndisplayed their greatest activity in the way of railway destruction.\r\nAt Norval's Pont and Bethulie they broke down the bridges crossing the\r\nOrange River, which divided Cape Colony from the Orange Free State.\r\nBefore leaving Bloemfontein (occupied by the British March 13, 1900),\r\nthey destroyed all the bridges and all the culverts on the railway in\r\ntheir rear; they blew up miles of the permanent way, and they left the\r\nrailway itself an almost complete wreck. North of Bloemfontein they\r\npursued similar tactics along 180 miles of track, on which they wrecked\r\nmore or less completely no fewer than fifty bridges, including the one\r\nover the Vaal River--a high structure with seven spans each of 130 feet.\r\nNo sooner, too, had the line been reopened as far as Johannesburg than\r\nCommandant De Wet made a raid on it and undid all that the repairing\r\nparties had done over a length of thirty miles. Speedily following the\r\nre-establishing of rail communication with Pretoria, the Boers began\r\na fresh series of guerilla attacks on the lines both in the Transvaal\r\nand in the Orange Free State; and they continued these attacks for\r\nmonths--until, in fact, their power for doing further mischief had been\r\nfinally checked.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out repairs and reconstruction work of such vital importance\r\nto the advance and security of the British forces, the policy adopted\r\nby the Director of Railways was that of employing Royal Engineers to do\r\nrapid temporary repairs--with a view to having a line of some sort made\r\navailable with the least possible delay--and leaving permanent or even\r\nsemi-permanent repairs to the Railway Pioneer Regiment. At convenient\r\nsidings on the railways throughout the theatre of war _construction\r\ntrains_ were stationed in charge of permanent-way inspectors and\r\nsections of Royal Engineers who had at their disposal, at each of such\r\nsidings, a gang of men--whites and natives--varying in number from 300\r\nto 1,000, according to circumstances. Infantry working-parties were also\r\nobtained wherever possible.\r\n\r\nGangers began a patrol of the lines at dawn. Information as to any\r\nbreak or alarm was communicated to the nearest military post and\r\ntelegraphed to the Deputy-Superintendent of Works, who thereupon ordered\r\nthe dispatch of a construction train to the scene of any reported or\r\nprospective break without waiting for confirmation of the news received\r\nor of the suspicions aroused.\r\n\r\nThis well-organised system operated to great advantage. At 2.30\r\na.m. on January 1, 1901, for instance, information reached the\r\nDeputy-Superintendent of Works at Bloemfontein that a break of the line\r\nhad occurred at Wolvehoek, sixty-three miles distant. The construction\r\ntrain was instantly dispatched, and the repairs were completed by 8\r\na.m. Rail communication with Johannesburg, notwithstanding the great\r\namount of destruction done by the Boers, was restored within eleven\r\ndays of the arrival of Lord Roberts at that place. It was restored to\r\nPretoria within sixteen days of the occupation thereof by our troops. On\r\nthe western side, where the enemy had been no less active than in the\r\nOrange Free State, rail communication was reopened within thirteen days\r\nof the relief of Mafeking.\r\n\r\nIn the official report on Field Transport in the South African War, it\r\nis said in regard to the Railways Department:--\r\n\r\n    All temporary repairs in the Cape Colony, Transvaal, and\r\n    Orange River Colony were carried out, with a few exceptions,\r\n    by the military railway staff. Up to 31 October, 1900, these\r\n    temporary repairs included the restoration of seventy-five\r\n    bridges, ninety-four culverts, and 37 miles of line. A detail\r\n    of the general advance from Bloemfontein to Johannesburg, a\r\n    distance of 265 miles, will give some idea of the expedition\r\n    with which repairs were affected. The period during which the\r\n    advance was being made was from 3 May to 11 June, 1900, in which\r\n    space of time the following temporary repairs were executed:\r\n    Twenty-seven bridges, forty-one culverts, 10 miles of line,\r\n    including seven deviations, varying in length from 200 yards to\r\n    2 miles.\r\n\r\n    From 6 June to 15 November, 1900, the Imperial Military\r\n    Railways were more or less seriously damaged by the enemy on 115\r\n    occasions, but all such damages were promptly repaired, and did\r\n    not materially affect the working of the railways, except that\r\n    the running of trains after dark had to be suspended. During the\r\n    same period fully 60 per cent. of damaged bridges and culverts\r\n    were permanently or semi-permanently repaired.\r\n\r\nOf _bridges_, over 200, with spans ranging from nine feet to 130 feet,\r\nwere destroyed wholly or in part during the progress of the war; but\r\neven here the speedy restoration of traffic did not, as a rule, present\r\nany very grave difficulty. The course generally adopted, as one suited\r\nto South African conditions, was, not to start at once on the repair\r\nof the damaged bridge, but, in order to meet the exigencies of the\r\nmoment, to construct a diversion or deviation line alongside, with small\r\nlow-level bridges on piers, built of sleepers and rails.[41] These\r\ndeviation lines offered great disadvantages by reason of their sharp\r\ncurves, their steep approaches and their liability to be washed away in\r\nwet weather. The building even of temporary bridges across deep rivers\r\nhaving a considerable volume of water also caused inevitable delays.\r\nBut the lines in question served their purpose until the reconstruction\r\nof the damaged bridges--taken in hand as speedily as possible--could\r\nbe effected. Anticipating the needs for this more permanent work, the\r\nDirector of Railways had arranged before leaving England for a supply\r\nof girders, similar to those in use in South Africa, to be sent out,\r\ntogether with sufficient timber, of useful dimensions, to rebuild the\r\nwhole of the railway bridges in the Orange Free State, should it become\r\nnecessary so to do--as, in point of fact, it did. Of new rails he had\r\navailable, at one time, a total length of 300 miles.\r\n\r\nBy October, 1900, the makeshift repairs completed on all the lines\r\ntaken from the enemy were being gradually converted into permanent or\r\nsemi-permanent reconstruction by the Works Department of the Imperial\r\nMilitary Railways; but the continuous guerilla raids of the enemy still\r\nmade it impossible to run trains by night. These conditions led to a\r\nresort to the system of _blockhouses_ which, first constructed for the\r\ndefence of railway bridges in Natal during the advance for the relief\r\nof Ladysmith, and used extensively when Lord Roberts marched from\r\nBloemfontein into the Transvaal, leaving a long track of railway lines\r\nbehind him, were subsequently so far extended that the whole of the\r\nrailway lines in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony were provided\r\nwith them.[42] So well did they answer the purpose that by April, 1901,\r\nthe worst of the trouble involved in maintaining railway communications\r\nwas over, although another year was to elapse before peace was restored.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY TRAFFIC\r\n\r\nAn especially remarkable achievement with which, under the various\r\nconditions here narrated, the Department of Military Railways is to be\r\ncredited was in connection with the concentration of the force with\r\nwhich Lord Roberts marched from the Modder River to Bloemfontein. The\r\nmovement began on January 21, 1900, by which time the repairs of the\r\nlines had been completed, and within three weeks no fewer than 20,000\r\nmen, 13,590 horses and over 24,000 tons of stores had been conveyed over\r\na single line of railway.\r\n\r\nTaking the sum total of the military traffic carried on the Cape\r\nGovernment and the Natal Government Railways respectively during the war\r\nperiod, we get the following substantial figures:--\r\n\r\nCape Government Railways, from October 1, 1899, to March 31,\r\n1901:--Officers, men, and other passengers, 1,247,000; supplies, etc.,\r\n1,058,000 tons; horses and other live stock, 540,321, besides many\r\nwagons and guns.\r\n\r\nNatal Government Railways:--Officers, men, prisoners of war, sick and\r\nwounded, women and children (including Boer refugees), natives and\r\nIndians, 522,186; baggage and stores, supplies, hay, forage, etc.,\r\n861,000 tons; ammunition, 9,784 boxes; guns, 454; vehicles, 6,430;\r\npontoons, 48; traction engines, 84; horses and other live stock, 399,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS SERVICES\r\n\r\nThe figures here given as to the military traffic carried do not\r\nrepresent the full extent of the work that was done by the South African\r\nrailways during the course of the war. One must also take into account\r\nthe wide variety of subsidiary services rendered, and these are the\r\nmore deserving of attention because they show, more than had, perhaps,\r\nbeen the case in any previous war, that railways can afford valuable\r\naid in the conduct of a campaign apart from the achievement of their\r\nfundamental purpose in the transport of men and matériel.\r\n\r\nIf we look atthe list of services rendered by the Natal Government\r\nRailways we find that the Railway Department--in addition to the\r\ntransport work represented by the above figures--adapted six armoured\r\ntrains; prepared special carriages for the 6 in. and 4·7 in. guns;\r\nadapted and equipped three hospital trains, withdrawing for this\r\npurpose fully a quarter of the most serviceable carriage stock from\r\nthe ordinary traffic; wired and lamped the hospitals at four different\r\ncentres, supplying them, also, with electric current; mounted the\r\nelectric search-light apparatus with engine, dynamo, etc.; supplied\r\n30,000 troops at Colenso with water; found the plant and fuel at\r\nLadysmith for condensing water from the Klip River for 20,000 persons\r\nduring the four months' siege; allotted and arranged a portion of the\r\ngoods-shed as the Base Medical Stores at Durban, and fitted up vans to\r\nfollow the army with reserve medical supplies.\r\n\r\nThe Department's Engineering Staff speedily restored, or temporarily\r\nprovided--either on the Natal system or along 100 miles of the Transvaal\r\nrailways, when these passed under control of the British forces--72\r\nbridges and culverts, varying in length from 10 to 600 feet; 32\r\ndifferent portions of permanent way; and many water tanks, etc. The\r\nEngineering Staff also effected in seven days a clearance through the\r\nLang's Nek Tunnel, blown in by the Boers, and constructed several miles\r\nof new lines, sidings and deviations.\r\n\r\nThe Natal Railway Pioneer Staff advanced with General Buller and worked\r\nthe Netherlands Railway as far as Greylingstad, 100 miles beyond\r\nCharlestown (the point of traffic exchange with the Transvaal system),\r\nuntil the line was taken over by the Imperial authorities on August 15,\r\n1900.\r\n\r\n\"For nearly six months, up to the relief of Ladysmith,\" says Mr. C. W.\r\nFrancis Harrison, from whose official work on \"Natal\"[43] these details\r\nare mainly taken, \"the Natal lines were robbed of about 40 per cent. of\r\ntheir total mileage and a quantity of their stock. On the clearance of\r\nthe enemy from Natal and the south-eastern portion of the Transvaal,\r\nlarge supply depôts were formed at Newcastle, Volksrust, Standerton and\r\nintermediate points; and on the joining of the two main portions of the\r\nBritish army at Heidelberg, the greater portion of the stores for the\r\nforces was conveyed via Natal; and this continued unceasingly until the\r\ntermination of hostilities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nARMOURED TRAINS\r\n\r\nIt was, again, in the South African war that armoured trains underwent\r\ntheir greatest development--down to that time--for the purposes alike\r\nof line protection and of attack on the enemy, although their real\r\nusefulness and the conditions necessary to their efficient operation\r\nwere not established until after certain early experiences which had\r\ntended to throw doubts upon their efficiency, and had even led to their\r\nbeing regarded as of little or no account for the purposes of war.\r\n\r\nIn view of prospective requirements, five armoured trains had been\r\nconstructed in advance in the locomotive shops at Cape Town and another\r\nat Natal. Others were put together shortly afterwards; but one of the\r\nCape trains was wrecked by the Boers the first night of the war, and\r\ntwo of the Natal trains were locked up in Ladysmith. The remainder\r\nwere employed on scouting expeditions during the earlier phases of the\r\nwar. Their use not being then rightly understood, they were often sent\r\nconsiderable distances without any support, with the result that one of\r\nthe Natal trains was destroyed by the Boers at Chieveley, on November\r\n15, 1899, and the Cape trains had several narrow escapes of sharing the\r\nsame fate.\r\n\r\nOn the occupation of Bloemfontein by the British, more armoured trains\r\nwere constructed at the railway workshops there, and eventually the\r\nnumber available was increased to a fleet of twenty. Under an improved\r\nsystem of control and operation, and converted, by the addition of guns,\r\ninto what were virtually batteries on wheels, the trains came to be\r\nregarded as offering possibilities of much practical usefulness.\r\n\r\nIn a lecture on \"Railways in War,\" delivered by him at the Royal\r\nEngineers' Institute, Chatham, and reported in the \"Royal Engineers\r\nJournal\" for July, 1905, Sir Percy Girouard, said:--\r\n\r\n    The South African War at one time threatened to produce\r\n    a siege, that of Pretoria, where fairly modern forts with\r\n    modern armaments were known to exist. At the same time the\r\n    enemy at Modder River were giving us some trouble with their\r\n    heavy artillery. The Navy came to our rescue with heavy B.L.\r\n    guns mounted on wheels. With a view to trying the use of the\r\n    railway itself, it was pointed out that the railway department\r\n    had both the shops and the goodwill to mount heavy guns, if\r\n    required. This offer was approved, and in a few weeks the two\r\n    heaviest siege guns ever seen in the field were made ready.\r\n    The carriages, designed by the combined wit of the machinery\r\n    officers and the Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the Cape\r\n    Government Railway, were most creditable achievements, old\r\n    engine and tender frames being used as a foundation. The guns\r\n    mounted were a 6-inch B.L., and no less a monster than a 9·2\r\n    inch B.L. The 6-inch went into action at Modder River. It\r\n    was deemed unsafe to fix it at an angle of more than sixteen\r\n    degrees to either side of the centre line of the railway; but\r\n    by placing it on a so-called firing curve a wider field of fire\r\n    was secured. The gun behaved exceedingly well in every way; and\r\n    later on it was fired at right angles to the railway, without\r\n    any damage either to itself or to the line.\r\n\r\nThe 9·2-inch gun gave good results in its trials, but, although it was\r\nrun up to Pretoria on its truck, there was no opportunity of firing it\r\non the enemy.\r\n\r\nSir Percy says in his \"History\" that--\r\n\r\n    The experiments demonstrated the possibility of big guns\r\n    being used in siege operations without any difficulty, the only\r\n    limit to the size of the gun being the weight which the railway\r\n    bridges will stand.\r\n\r\nApart from the powers of usefulness offered by these batteries on\r\nwheels, there arose, in the early days of the war, the further question\r\nwhether the usefulness of armoured trains proper might not be marred as\r\nthe result of a defective system of control.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the trains were placed entirely under the orders of\r\nofficers commanding sections of the line; but the arrangement was found\r\nunsatisfactory as the trains were constantly being rushed out regardless\r\nof Traffic Department regulations, and sometimes without even a \"line\r\nclear\" message. Having, also, the trains at their disposal, as they\r\nconsidered officers commanding sections of the line often made use of\r\nthem to inspect posts between stations, other traffic being stopped\r\nwhile the inspections were being made. On one occasion, when a large mob\r\nof cattle was being sent to Pretoria and there were no mounted troops\r\navailable to convoy them, the expedient was resorted to of employing an\r\narmoured train for the purpose. The train had to adapt its speed to the\r\nrate of progress of the cattle alongside, and such was the interference\r\nwith other traffic that the entire length of railway on the Delagoa\r\nmain line was blocked until the cattle had reached their destination.\r\nIn fact, instead of assisting traffic by preventing the enemy from\r\ninterrupting it, the armoured trains caused, Sir Percy Girouard\r\ndeclares, \"more interruptions than the enemy themselves.\"\r\n\r\nWith a view both to meet these particular difficulties and to ensure\r\na better use of the trains, there was appointed an Assistant-Director\r\nof Armoured Trains who was placed on the staff both of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief and of the Director of Railways and had under his\r\ncontrol all the armoured trains in South Africa. Captain H. C. Nanton,\r\nR.E., the officer so appointed, had practical acquaintance alike with\r\nrailway requirements and regulations and with armoured trains. In touch\r\nwith Headquarters, and kept informed as to which portions of the line\r\nwere most threatened by the enemy, it became his duty to order where\r\nthe trains should be sent. Once despatched to a particular section of\r\nthe line, an armoured train was to be under the control of the General\r\nor other officer commanding that section. The Assistant-Director\r\nhad power to remove it, however, if he thought it was more urgently\r\nrequired elsewhere. It was his duty, also, to work in harmony with\r\nthe officers in question; but they, in turn, were not to use as a\r\nprivate conveyance the train sent to them, and they were not to alter\r\nits garrison or equipment, or to give orders to the officer in charge\r\nwhich were contrary to the spirit of the general instructions. The\r\nAssistant-Director was himself required to instruct officers in command\r\nof the trains as to the proper tactics to adopt, the best methods\r\nof patrolling, etc., and to see that they \"worked in harmony with\r\nthe railway officials, and were an assistance and not a hindrance to\r\ntraffic.\"\r\n\r\nThese improved conditions led to a recognised system for the employment\r\nof armoured trains, the purposes and duties of which were eventually\r\ndefined as follows[44]:--\r\n\r\n1. In conjunction with columns in the field, to intercept the enemy whom\r\nthe columns were driving on to the line.\r\n\r\n2. To act on the flank of a column or line of columns, the train being\r\nwell advanced so as to prevent the enemy breaking to that flank.\r\n\r\n3. To reinforce stations and camps on the railway which were threatened\r\nby the enemy.\r\n\r\n4. To escort ordinary traffic trains.\r\n\r\n5. To reconnoitre.\r\n\r\n6. To patrol by day and night.\r\n\r\n7. To protect traffic routes generally.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of an armoured train consisted of an Infantry escort and\r\nRoyal Artillery and Royal Engineer detachments. The R.E. detachment\r\nconsisted of one N.C.O. and six sappers skilled in railway repairing\r\nwork and in re-setting derailed engines and trucks; two telegraph\r\nlinesmen; one telegraph clerk; two engine-drivers and two firemen.\r\nWhen the train was engaged, all counted as effective rifles with the\r\nexception of the driver and firemen on the footplate, and even they\r\ncarried rifles in their engine cab for use against an enemy endeavouring\r\nto gain possession of the engine.\r\n\r\nResponsibility for the efficiency of the garrisons was placed upon the\r\nAssistant-Director of Armoured Trains. Whenever, also, a concentration\r\nof the trains had been decided upon, he was to attach himself to one of\r\nthem, and take charge of the concerted action of the whole.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the operation of the trains Captain M. H. Grant\r\nwrites[45]:--\r\n\r\n    It was important that the officer commanding the train\r\n    should be a man of judgment and strong nerve. He was often\r\n    called upon to act on his own responsibility. His strong\r\n    armament and defences enabled him to attack superior forces.\r\n    Yet his vulnerable points were many. He had ever to be alert\r\n    that the enemy did not cut the line behind him. In addition\r\n    to his visible foes and the constant risks of traffic in war\r\n    time, he had to contend with skilfully-used automatic and\r\n    observation mines, and had to keep his head even amid the roar\r\n    which followed the passage of his leading truck over a charge\r\n    of dynamite, and then to deal with the attack which almost\r\n    certainly ensued. Officers, therefore, had to be chosen from\r\n    men of no common stamp. The danger from contact mines was to\r\n    a certain extent obviated by a standing order that each train\r\n    should propel a heavily-loaded bogie truck. Such trucks had\r\n    low sides and ends; they in no way obstructed the view, or\r\n    fire, from the trains; and they performed the double purpose of\r\n    exploding contact mines and carrying the railway and telegraph\r\n    materials. The necessity for this propelled unoccupied bogie was\r\n    exemplified on several occasions.\r\n\r\nAs regards their protection of the railway lines, the armoured trains\r\nrendered an invaluable service, and this was especially the case when\r\nthe blockhouse system had been fully developed, and when, concurrently\r\ntherewith, the enemy's artillery became scarce. In recording this\r\nopinion, Sir Percy Girouard further observes:--\"There is no doubt, also,\r\nthat the enemy disliked them intensely, and the presence of an armoured\r\ntrain had a great moral effect.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the organisation and running of these armoured trains,\r\nthere was included in every ordinary train, as far as possible, a\r\nspecial gun-truck on which was a pedestal-mounted Q. F. gun, under the\r\ncharge of an escort. The trains also carried a machine gun at each end,\r\narranged with a lateral sweep, to allow the fires to cross on either\r\nside of the train at a distance of from fifty to eighty yards. In\r\naddition to this, armour plates were hung on each side of the driver's\r\ncab, and the first train run each morning had two or three trucks in\r\nfront of the engine as a precaution against any mine that might have\r\nbeen laid over-night.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBULANCE AND HOSPITAL TRAINS\r\n\r\nSupplementing the references already made on pp. 95-6 to the employment\r\nof ambulance and hospital trains in the South African War, it may here\r\nbe stated that three out of the seven adapted from rolling stock already\r\nin use on the Cape or the Natal Government lines had been prepared in\r\nadvance of the outbreak of hostilities, namely, two at the Cape and one\r\nin Natal, and these three were, consequently, available for immediate\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\"In Cape Colony,\" as stated in \"_The Times_ History of the War in South\r\nAfrica,\" \"the two hospital trains that had been prepared in September\r\nwere manned by a complete _personnel_ from England, and were kept in\r\nconstant touch with Lord Methuen's advance. In most cases they were\r\nrun up almost into the firing line, and during the actions at Belmont,\r\nGraspan, Modder River and Magersfontein, they relieved the force of its\r\nsick and wounded in an incredibly short time, conveying some to De Aar\r\nand Orange River, and others to the general hospitals at Cape Town.\" The\r\nservices thus rendered by the hospital trains were greatly facilitated\r\nby the fact that during the first three months of the war the fighting\r\nwas almost entirely on or alongside the railways. It was, therefore,\r\npossible to arrange for a speedy evacuation of wounded from the field\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\nThe same two trains, after working along the line of communication in\r\nCape Colony, reached Bloemfontein early in April, 1900; and here they\r\nwere of great use in helping to remove the sufferers from the enteric\r\nfever which was filling up, not only all the hospitals, but every other\r\navailable building, as well, and finally attained, by the end of May, a\r\nmaximum of 4,000 cases. Unable to meet all requirements arising under\r\nthese exceptional conditions, the two hospital trains were supplemented\r\nby a number of locally-prepared or ordinary trains, made available for\r\nthe transport either of sick or of convalescents.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Natal, \"_The Times_ History\" says that of all the medical\r\narrangements made in connection with the war, \"those during Sir Redvers\r\nBuller's operations in Natal presented the most satisfactory features.\"\r\n\r\nThe line of communication with the base was short, and it was amply\r\nsupplied with hospital trains. In addition to the one that had been\r\nformed before the outbreak of hostilities, a second and similar\r\ntrain was prepared in November, 1889. The hospital train, \"Princess\r\nChristian,\" constructed in England at a cost of £14,000, mainly raised\r\nby Her Royal Highness--with a handsome contribution from the town of\r\nWindsor--reached Cape Town early in February, 1900. It was sent on in\r\nsections to Durban, where it was put together in the Natal Government\r\nRailway workshops. Under the charge of Sir John Furley, who had also\r\nsupervised its reconstruction, the train was the first to cross the\r\ntemporary trestle bridge provided to take the place of the one across\r\nthe Tugela, at Colenso, which had been destroyed by the Boers, and it\r\nwas, also, the first train to enter Ladysmith (March 18, 1900) after the\r\nsiege. Between this time and September 5, 1901, it made 108 journeys,\r\nmainly on the Natal side and on the Pretoria-Koomati Poort line; it ran\r\na total of 42,000 miles, and it carried (in addition to the medical and\r\nnursing staff) 321 officers and 7,208 non-commissioned officers and men,\r\na total of 7,529 sick and wounded, of whom only three died _en route_.\r\nIn June, 1901, the train was formally presented by the Central Red Cross\r\nCommittee to the Secretary of State for War as a complete hospital\r\ntrain unit for the use of the military forces in South Africa; but, on\r\nthe assumption, apparently, that no further use for its services as a\r\nhospital train was likely to arise, it was subsequently dismantled.\r\n\r\nAs showing the extent of the work done by the other hospital trains\r\nduring the course of the war, it may be added that No. 2 ran 114,539\r\nmiles, in 226 trips, between November 22, 1898, and the end of August,\r\n1902, conveying 471 officers and 10,325 non-commissioned officers and\r\nmen, a total of 10,796, of whom only seven died _en route_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSVAAL RAILWAYS AND THE WAR\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing account of the British use of railways for military\r\npurposes during the course of the South African War it may be of\r\ninterest to add a few notes giving the experiences of the Boers, as\r\ndetailed in a statement on \"The Netherlands South African Railway\r\nCompany and the Transvaal War,\" drawn up at Pretoria, in April, 1900, by\r\nthe Secretary of the Company, Mr. Th. Steinnetz, and published in _De\r\nIngenieur_ of July 14 and 21, 1900.[46]\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of the concession granted to the Netherlands South\r\nAfrican Railway Company (otherwise the Nederland Zuid Afrikaansche\r\nSpoorweg Maatschappij) by the Government of the Transvaal Republic,\r\nthe latter were, in the event either of war or of danger of war, to\r\nhave complete control alike over the railway and over everything--and\r\neverybody--necessary for its use, subject to certain undertakings\r\nas to the payment of compensation to concessionaires. By virtue of\r\nthese powers the Executive Raad issued a decree on September 13,\r\n1899, establishing Government control over the lines, and stating\r\nfurther:--\"With the view of ensuring that proper use can be made of\r\nthe railway, the whole of the _personnel_ of the company are ...\r\ncommandeered to do duty on the railways in the functions they now\r\noccupy, and they are placed under the orders of the Commandant-General\r\nand the war officers indicated by him, or of other officials.\" The\r\nGovernment, in effect, took possession of all the lines, rolling stock,\r\nworkshops and other properties of the railway company for the purposes\r\nof military transport, and they assumed control over the staff in order\r\nto ensure the working, not only of the company's own lines, but, also,\r\nof the lines in such portions of British territory as might be occupied\r\nby the forces of the Republic.\r\n\r\nAgainst the possibility of an immediate invasion of the\r\nTransvaal--\"about which,\" says the statement, \"there was much anxiety\r\non account of the armoured trains, which the English advertised so\r\nloudly\"--precautions were taken by preparing for demolition some of the\r\nbridges on the south-eastern section of the company's lines. Guards\r\nwere, also, stationed at bridges and other important points throughout\r\nthe Transvaal in order to protect them against attack or interference by\r\n\"the great number of Anglophiles\" assumed to be still in the Republic;\r\nbut the statement seems to suggest that, as shown by the small number\r\nof attempts made in this direction, the British rather neglected their\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the transport of Transvaal troops, difficulties arose at\r\nthe outset owing to the absence of data, even of the vaguest character,\r\nas to the numbers of burghers, horses and wagons it would be necessary\r\nto convey by train. Consequently, no military time-tables could be\r\ndrawn up, and the traffic demands were met as best they could be when\r\nthey were made. No more, however, than eleven trains a day, in each\r\ndirection, could be run on the south-eastern branch--a single-track\r\nline, with stations and crossing places about one hour's journey apart.\r\nConcerning the amount of traffic carried, Mr. Steinnetz says:--\r\n\r\n    The total military traffic to the frontier was not so great\r\n    as one would expect, in spite of only a portion of the burghers\r\n    having taken up arms. From various districts the commandos\r\n    marched mounted, with ox-wagons, to the place of assembly, as\r\n    had been the custom in the past, although the use of the railway\r\n    would have saved time and trouble to both horses and men. Yet\r\n    it was not the first time that the Transvaalers had had the\r\n    opportunity of learning the use of railways in warfare. At the\r\n    time of the Jameson Raid and the Magato Campaign full use had\r\n    been made of them.\r\n\r\nAmong the railway bridges which the Boers had prepared for destruction,\r\nin case of need, was an iron one of 116 ft. span, the blowing up of\r\nwhich would have checked the anticipated British invasion of the\r\nTransvaal via Lang's Nek; but the concentration of the British forces\r\nat Dundee and Ladysmith allowed the Boers to enter Natal without\r\nresistance; and they took over, in sections, the working of the Natal\r\nrailway in proportion as they advanced. At various stations in northern\r\nNatal long platforms had been specially constructed by the British,\r\nand other arrangements made, to permit of large movements of troops\r\nand especially the detraining of cavalry. These improvements, says Mr.\r\nSteinnetz, came in very handy for the Federal Army. The _personnel_\r\nof the lines had \"retired in a great hurry,\" without attempting any\r\ndemolitions or doing any damage to the lines beyond what could be easily\r\nrepaired. The Lang's Nek tunnel was \"wholly untouched.\" Mr. Steinnetz\r\ncontinues:--\r\n\r\n    The Boers themselves, however, through fear of being\r\n    surprised by armoured trains, and for other reasons, gave\r\n    the breakdown gangs more work to do. The telegraph line was\r\n    destroyed by them for long distances, the track was broken up\r\n    and two bridges were damaged. In order to obstruct the retreat\r\n    of General Yule from Dundee a bridge of two 30-foot spans on\r\n    the Dundee branch line was blown up by the Irish Brigade with\r\n    a dynamite charge in the central pier. The damage done was not\r\n    very great and was easily repaired. The same ineffective measure\r\n    was applied with greater success to a similar bridge over a\r\n    small spruit near Waschbank. But even here the repair was not\r\n    difficult.\r\n\r\nThese admissions as to the ease with which the work of destruction\r\ncould, as a rule, readily be put right again are in full accord with\r\nSir Percy Girouard's report, in dealing with the same subject. It is\r\nonly fair to accept, in turn, the assertion made by Mr. Steinnetz that\r\nthe damage which the British did to certain of the railway bridges was\r\n\"speedily repaired.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the later destruction work carried out by the Boers was of\r\na more serious character. The blowing up of the Tugela bridge at\r\nColenso--a structure consisting of five iron lattice girder spans of\r\n100 ft. each on masonry piles--was entrusted by the Boer military\r\nauthorities to an inspector of the railway company who had served in the\r\nDutch engineers. It was accomplished by the simultaneous detonation of\r\nforty dynamite charges all connected by leads to a Siemens and Halske\r\n\"exploder,\" the bridge being \"thoroughly demolished.\" In the destruction\r\nof the three-span bridge over the Orange River at Norval's Pont the\r\ncharge employed consisted of about three and a half chests of dynamite,\r\nor 198 lbs. Concerning the general destruction of bridges by which the\r\nBoers sought to check pursuit after their abandonment of the siege of\r\nLadysmith, Mr. Steinnitz says:--\"There was no lack of explosives, and no\r\nneed to spare them.\"\r\n\r\nThe central workshops of the Netherlands Company were made use of by the\r\nGovernment for the repair of guns, rifles, wagons, etc., and for the\r\nmanufacture of war material. Four complete ambulance trains were also\r\nfitted up there for the use of wounded burghers.\r\n\r\nAll the traffic on the lines was done on Government orders, and all\r\nexpenses were charged to them. No private traffic at all was carried.\r\nThere were, consequently, no railway receipts, and the railway company\r\nhad no responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF RAIL POWER\r\n\r\nIn one way or another the South African War of 1899-1902 was concerned\r\nin many of the most complicated of the problems that arise in connection\r\nwith the use of railways for military purposes.[47]\r\n\r\nIn various ways, also, it advanced to a still further stage the whole\r\nquestion of the nature and possibilities of rail-power in war.\r\n\r\nIt confirmed under especially remarkable conditions a fact which\r\nthe American War of Secession had already established, namely, that\r\neven single lines of railway, passing through country occupied by or\r\nbelonging to the enemy, may allow of campaigns being conducted at\r\nsuch distances from the base of supplies as, but for this means of\r\ncommunication, would render war impracticable.\r\n\r\nIt offered further evidence as to the possibility, in favourable\r\ncircumstances, of employing railways for the carrying out of important\r\ntactical movements.\r\n\r\nIt re-established the essential need of organisation for the attainment\r\nof efficiency in military transport and especially in so far as such\r\norganisation deals with questions of control and co-ordination of the\r\nmilitary and the technical elements.\r\n\r\nIt placed on a recognised and clearly defined basis the uses of armoured\r\ntrains and the best methods to be adopted for their construction and\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nIt showed still more clearly, perhaps, than any previous war had done,\r\nthe useful and beneficent purposes served by ambulance and hospital\r\ntrains, whether constructed for the purpose or adapted from existing\r\nrailway stock.\r\n\r\nIt proved that, however apparently insecure a line of rail communication\r\nmay be, and however active and destructive the attacks made on it by\r\na pertinacious enemy, yet, with a strong and well-organised force of\r\nRailway Troops following close on the advancing army, and supplemented\r\nby an efficient system of line-protection, repairs and reconstruction\r\ncan be carried out with such speed that comparatively little material\r\ndelay will be caused, the final result of the campaign will not\r\nnecessarily be affected, and the value of rail-power as an instrument of\r\nwar will suffer no actual reduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] In Vol. II of the \"Detailed History of the Railways in the South\r\nAfrican War\" (Chatham: Royal Engineers Institute, 1904), there is\r\na series of 45 full-page photographs of damaged bridges and of the\r\nlow-level deviations constructed to take their place.\r\n\r\n[42] For a description of these blockhouses, see vol. iii, pp. 125-6, of\r\nthe \"History of the Corps of the Royal Engineers,\" by Col.

C.\r\nGirouard, K.C.M.G., R.E., of the British Army, whose work in Egypt and\r\nSouth Africa has set a high standard for any engineer who in future may\r\nbe required to meet and solve railway problems in the theatre of war.\r\nThese reports give the solution of many points as worked out in the\r\nfield, and confirm the main lessons to be learned from the history of\r\nthe military railways in our Civil War.\" (See \"Bibliography.\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSO-JAPANESE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5 was a test not so much of the military\r\nstrength of the two combatants as of their respective means of\r\ncommunication and concentration.\r\n\r\nFrom Moscow to Port Arthur the distance is 5,300 miles, and, save for\r\nthe sea journey via the Baltic, the North Sea, the Atlantic and the\r\nIndian Ocean, the Russians were dependent for the transport of their\r\ntroops and stores to Manchuria on such very inadequate railways as they\r\nthen controlled. Japan, on the other hand, was able to rely on her fleet\r\nand her considerably developed mercantile marine; and, as soon as she\r\nhad paralysed the Russian fleet and established her own command of the\r\nsea--as she did within two days of the outbreak of hostilities--she\r\ncould land her forces whenever she chose at almost any convenient point\r\non the sea-board of the theatre of war.\r\n\r\nThe situation recalled, somewhat, the still worse position in which\r\nRussia had found herself at the time of the Crimean War when, in the\r\nabsence of any rail facilities at all, her troops had to march, and\r\ntheir supplies and munitions had to be conveyed, hundreds of miles over\r\ndreary steppes--\"huge columns that had quitted the far north and east of\r\nthe interior dwindling to a few broken-down Battalions before they came\r\nin sight of Sebastopol\"--whereas the allies could send their troops all\r\nthe way to the Crimea by sea.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many other causes which, rightly or wrongly, have been\r\nregarded as contributing to the defeat of Russia by Japan--included\r\ntherein being personal shortcomings of the Russian officers; mistakes\r\nmade by them in strategy and tactics; defects in the Russian military\r\nsystem, and the half-hearted interest of the Russian nation in the\r\nstruggle--the really decisive factors in the situation were the\r\ntransport deficiencies of the Siberian and Manchurian railways.\r\n\r\nThe construction of a _Trans-Siberian Railway_ as a great strategic\r\nline stretching across Asia, facilitating the development of a vast\r\nterritory, and, above all, calculated to foster the realisation of\r\nRussia's aims in the Far East, first came under discussion about the\r\nyear 1860. It was made the subject of an exhaustive study by a Committee\r\nof Ministers in 1875, but it was not until 1891 that the first sod was\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nMilitary and political considerations being paramount, such energy was\r\nshown in the work of construction that by 1896 the western section\r\nhad been carried through Irkutsk to Lake Baikal and from the eastern\r\nshores thereof to Strietensk, while the eastern section--known as the\r\nUsuri Railway--had been made through Russia's Maritime Province from\r\nVladivostok to Khabarovsk. The original design was that the line should\r\nbe constructed on Russian territory all the way to Vladivostok; but\r\nthis meant that from Strietensk it would have to follow the great bend\r\nmade to the north by the Amur, the southern boundary of Russia, and the\r\nRussian Government thought it desirable to secure a more direct route.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1896, in return for the great services which she\r\nconsidered she had rendered to China in the war between that country and\r\nJapan, Russia obtained the concession for a railway which, starting from\r\nChita, Trans-Baikalia, about 200 miles west of Strietensk, would pass\r\nthrough Manchuria to Vladivostok, avoiding the great bend of the Amur,\r\nthough still offering the disadvantage that one important section of the\r\nthrough route would not be on Russian territory. Under a contract made\r\nbetween the Chinese Government and the Russo-Chinese Bank, a _Chinese\r\nEastern Railway Company_ was formed to build and operate the line thus\r\nconceded; but the arrangements made were carried out through the Russian\r\nMinister of Finance, and the line was directly dependent on the Russian\r\nState.\r\n\r\nRussia's occupation of Port Arthur in March, 1898, led, in the spring\r\nof the following year, to the further construction being begun of a\r\nsouthern branch of the Chinese Eastern Railway from Harbin, a station on\r\nthe Chita-Vladivostok line, to the extremity of the Liao-tung peninsula.\r\n\r\nIt was these two railways, the Trans-Siberian and the Chinese Eastern,\r\nterminating at Vladivostok in the one direction and at Port Arthur in\r\nthe other, which came into special consideration in the war of 1904-5.\r\nIt was on the Trans-Siberian line, more especially, that Russia was\r\nmainly dependent (as the German official report on the war points out)\r\nnot only for the concentration and maintenance of her army but even for\r\nthe raising and organisation of most of its units.\r\n\r\nWhen the Trans-Siberian was first built, the desire to avoid undue\r\nexpenditure on a line which must necessarily involve a huge expenditure,\r\nwith little or no prospect of yielding a return sufficient for the\r\npayment of interest thereon, led to the adoption of an economy which was\r\nto hamper very materially the transport capacity of the railway. Only a\r\nsingle line of rails was allowed for; a limit was placed on the breadth\r\nof the embankments; the curves were greater than considerations of speed\r\nand safety should have permitted; the gradients were either dangerously\r\nvaried or so excessive that divisions of the trains were necessary;\r\nthe rails used were of no greater weight than from 42 lbs. to 47 lbs.\r\nper yard, and they were badly laid, even then; the bridges across the\r\nsmaller streams were made of wood only; the crossing-places and the\r\nrailway stations were few and far between, while all the secondary\r\nconstructions were provided on what was almost the cheapest possible\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nThese conditions necessitated the limitation of the traffic, when the\r\nline was first opened, to the running of three trains a day in each\r\ndirection. The length of the trains was restricted to sixty axles. It\r\nwas thus impossible to meet the demands even of the ordinary traffic\r\nin peace time, apart altogether from any question as to military\r\nrequirements in time of war. No sooner, therefore, were the main\r\nportions of the line ready, in 1898, than there was set aside, for\r\na railway which was already to cost over £350,000,000, a further sum\r\nof £9,130,000 for relaying those portions of the line with a better\r\nquality of rails and sleepers, the reconstruction of sections dangerous\r\nto traffic, the provision of more stations and more rolling stock, and\r\nother improvements. It was expected that this additional work would be\r\ncompleted by 1904, by which time the line was to be equal to the running\r\nof thirteen pairs of trains daily.\r\n\r\nReporting on the condition of the Russian railways in 1900 (at which\r\ndate the Eastern Chinese line was still unfinished), General Kuropatkin,\r\nthen War Minister, afterwards Commander-in-Chief in Manchuria, did not\r\nhesitate to declare that it was still impossible for them to cope with\r\nheavy traffic.\r\n\r\nRelations between Russia and Japan became strained towards the end of\r\n1903, though the Government of the former country were desirous that any\r\noutbreak of hostilities should be avoided until they were better able\r\nto undertake them. In his account of \"The Russian Army and the Japanese\r\nWar\" General Kuropatkin says concerning the position at this period:--\r\n\r\n    Our unreadiness was only too plain, and it seemed at that\r\n    time that we should be able, with two or three years' steady\r\n    work, so to strengthen our position in the Far East, and improve\r\n    the railway, the fleet, the land forces, and the fortresses of\r\n    Port Arthur and Vladivostok that Japan would have small chance\r\n    of success against us.\r\n\r\nRegarding war as inevitable, and disinclined to give Russia an\r\nopportunity of first strengthening her position in the directions here\r\nsuggested, Japan broke off diplomatic relations with Russia on February\r\n6, 1904, this being the immediate prelude to the hostilities that\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of a possible rupture, Russia had already despatched\r\nreinforcements and stores to the Far East by sea; but the rupture,\r\nwhen it did come, found her quite unprepared to send further large\r\nreinforcements by land, while her forces in the Far East were scattered\r\nover the vast area extending from Lake Baikal to Vladivostok, and from\r\nPort Arthur to Nikolaievsk. No orders for mobilisation had been issued;\r\nthe army was in the midst of rearmament and reorganisation, and the\r\nunreadiness of the railways had prevented the drawing up of time-tables\r\nfor the concentration of the troops. Ten days after the outbreak of war\r\nthe Russian Government issued a statement in which they said:--\r\n\r\n    The distance of the territory now attacked and the desire of\r\n    the Tsar to maintain peace were the causes of the impossibility\r\n    of preparations for war being made a long time in advance.\r\n\r\nNot only, too, was the seat of war 5,000 miles away, and not only was\r\na single-track ill-equipped line of railway the only practicable means\r\nof sending troops and war material there by land, but an exceptionally\r\ngreat obstacle to traffic had to be met owing to the interruption of\r\nrail communication by Lake Baikal.\r\n\r\nHaving a length of 380 miles, a breadth ranging from eighteen miles to\r\nfifty-six miles, a mean depth of 850 feet (with a maximum, in parts, of\r\nno less than 4,500 ft.), and a total area of over 13,000 square miles,\r\n_Lake Baikal_ ranks, next to the great lakes of the United States and\r\nCentral Africa, as the largest fresh-water lake in the world; though it\r\nshould, in reality, be regarded less as a lake than as a great inland\r\nsea. As it happened, also, this vast expanse of water stood in the\r\ndirect line of route of the Trans-Siberian railway, and the crossing of\r\nit by the Russian reinforcements going to the Far East constituted a\r\nseriously defective link in the chain of communication.\r\n\r\nAt an elevation of 1,360 feet above sea level, the lake is subject\r\nalike to severe gales, to heavy fogs, and to frosts so intense that in\r\nmid-winter the water may be frozen to a depth of ten feet. From the end\r\nof April to the end of December troops and travellers arriving by rail\r\nat one side of the lake crossed to the other by passenger steamers.\r\nGoods wagons were taken over by ferry-boats which, also, acted as\r\nice-breakers early and late in the winter season, so long as the passage\r\ncould be kept open. When, in the winter, the ice was strong enough\r\nto bear, traffic was conducted by transport sledges; but when there\r\nwas sufficient ice to stop the ferry-boats, though not sufficient to\r\npermit of the sledges being used--conditions which generally prevailed\r\nfor about six weeks in the year--the traffic had to be discontinued\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nThe question will naturally be asked,--Why had not the constructors of\r\nthe line avoided these disadvantages by carrying it round the lake? The\r\nreply is that this had not been done, prior to the outbreak of war,\r\nowing to the formidable nature of the work involved from an engineering\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nLake Baikal is bordered, on the south--the route a Circum-Baikal line\r\nwould have to take--by mountains which rise sheer up from the water's\r\nedge to a height of, in places, no less than 4,600 ft. Across the\r\nmountains, along the rocky shores, and over the intervening valleys the\r\nrailway would require to be carried for a distance of 160 miles in order\r\nto link up the two sections then divided by the lake. The difficulties\r\nof the work were likely to be as great as the cost would certainly be\r\nenormous, compared with that of the remainder of the Trans-Siberian\r\nrailway. So it was that when the war broke out there were still 112\r\nmiles of the Circum-Baikal line to be constructed.\r\n\r\nSo it was, also, that, pending the completion of this line round the\r\nlake, Russia's reinforcements from Europe for the Far East had to\r\ncross the lake itself; and the outbreak of hostilities in the month of\r\nFebruary placed Russia at an especially great disadvantage in regard to\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\nThe combined ferry-steamers and ice-breakers had made their final\r\njourney for the winter on January 27, and at first the only way in\r\nwhich the troops could cross the ice was by marching or by sledge.\r\nAfter a day's rest at Irkutsk, they were brought by train to Baikal\r\nstation, at the lake side, arriving there at about four o'clock in\r\nthe morning in order that they could complete the journey to Tanchoi\r\nstation, on the other side of the lake--a distance of about twenty-five\r\nmiles--in the day. The track was marked out by posts, supplemented by\r\nlanterns at night, and it was kept in order by gangs of labourers.\r\nSmall bridges were placed over cracks in the ice. Shelters, in\r\ntelephonic communication with one another, were provided at four-mile\r\ndistances alike for the purpose of rest and for the distribution of food\r\nprepared by regimental field kitchens; but the principal meal of the\r\nday was taken at a more substantial half-way house, where the cooking\r\narrangements were on a more elaborate scale and better accommodation\r\nwas provided. Around the half-way house at night petroleum flares were\r\nburned, so that it could be seen a long way off. In foggy weather, or\r\nduring snow storms, bells were rung at all the shelters. Inasmuch as the\r\ntemperature fell, at times, to 22 deg., Fahr., below zero, the provision\r\nof these rest-houses must have been greatly appreciated. Baggage was\r\ntaken across in sledges, the normal supply of which had been increased\r\nby an additional 3,000. Some of the troops also made the journey by this\r\nform of conveyance, four men being seated in each sledge. The batteries\r\ncrossed with their own horses.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ice attained a thickness of about 4½ ft., the expedient\r\nwas adopted of laying a pair of rails along it in order, more\r\nespecially, that the additional engines and railway wagons urgently\r\nneeded on the lines east of the lake could be taken across. The\r\nrails were laid on sleepers of exceptional length, the weight being\r\nthus distributed over a greater surface of ice; but, even with this\r\nprecaution, it was no easy matter to keep the line in working order\r\nowing to the extreme cold, to storms, to the occasional ice movements\r\nand cracks, or to the effect of earthquake shocks in destroying lengths\r\nof line, sections of which sometimes required to be relaid almost as\r\nsoon as they had been put down. The line was begun on February 10 and\r\ncompleted by the 29th of the same month. Between March 1 and March 26\r\nthere were taken across the lake, by this means, sixty-five dismantled\r\nlocomotives (rebuilt on arrival on the eastern side), twenty-five\r\nrailway carriages, and 2,313 goods wagons. Transport was provided by\r\nhorses, the number so used being about 1,000.\r\n\r\nConstructed to serve an exclusively military purpose, this\r\ntwenty-five-mile line across Lake Baikal may certainly be regarded as\r\na \"military railway,\" while as a military ice-railway it holds a unique\r\nposition in the history of warfare.\r\n\r\nWhen, owing to the advancing season, the ice on the lake could no longer\r\nbe trusted to bear either railway trucks or sledges, and when navigation\r\nwas again open, dependence had to be placed on the ferry services. There\r\nwere, however, only two vessels available for the transfer of railway\r\ntrucks across the lake, and each of these, accommodating twenty-seven\r\ntrucks at a time, could make no more than three return crossings in the\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nOnly in one way could an improvement be effected in these obviously\r\ninadequate facilities for getting an army to Manchuria, and that was in\r\ncarrying the railway round the southern end of the lake, thus avoiding\r\nthe delay caused by the hitherto unavoidable transshipment and crossing,\r\nand ensuring a continuous rail journey. The need for this _Circum-Baikal\r\nlink_ had, in fact, become urgent, and the work was pushed on with the\r\ngreatest vigour.\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of the engineering difficulties which the\r\nconstruction of the line involved. These will be better understood if\r\nit is added that the 160-mile link passes through thirty-four tunnels,\r\nhaving an aggregate length of over six miles; that it is carried across\r\nvalleys, or open spaces, on two hundred bridges, and that numerous\r\ncuttings and many large culverts had also to be provided. The total\r\ncost worked out at no less than £52,000 per mile--probably the largest\r\nsum per mile ever spent on a railway designed, in the first instance,\r\nto serve a distinctly military purpose, and exceeding by £35,000 the\r\naverage cost per mile, down to that date, of the entire system of\r\nRussian railways. Delays occurred, also, through strikes and other\r\ncauses, and, in the result, it was not until September 25, 1904--more\r\nthan seven months after the outbreak of war--that the line was ready for\r\nuse, and that an interruption of the rail journey by the crossing of\r\nLake Baikal became no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, an inadequate supply of engines and rolling stock had been\r\na serious hindrance to traffic alike on the Trans-Baikal section of\r\nthe Siberian line and on the Eastern Chinese lines. The locomotives and\r\nwagons taken across Lake Baikal either on the ice-railway or on the\r\nferry boats had served a useful purpose, but six months elapsed before\r\nthe Eastern Chinese lines could be worked to their full efficiency.\r\n\r\nThere were other directions, as well, in which _traffic hindrances_\r\narose. The freezing, down to the very bottom, of the rivers between\r\nthe eastern side of Lake Baikal and Harbin (Manchuria) was a cause of\r\nserious difficulty in the early part of the year in getting water even\r\nfor such locomotives as were available. In the western Siberian section\r\nthe supply of water was impaired by the great percentage of salt in the\r\nstreams. In Manchuria the fuel reserve was inadequate; soldiers were\r\nthe only reliable portion of the subordinate railway staff; the railway\r\nworkshops were poorly equipped; there were not nearly enough engine\r\ndepôts; large supplies of rails, fish-plates, sleepers and ballast were\r\nneeded, and much work had to be done in the construction of additional\r\nsidings, etc. All these shortcomings required to be made good whilst\r\nthe war was in actual progress, though for the transport of most of the\r\nnecessary materials and appliances there was only a single-track line of\r\nrailway already overtaxed for the conveyance of troops, munitions and\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nThe _number of trains_ that could be run was extremely limited. The\r\ncapacity of the line of communication as a whole was fixed by that\r\nof the Eastern Chinese Railway between Chita and Harbin; and after\r\nthree months of war it was still possible to run from west to east in\r\neach twenty-four hours no more than three military trains (conveying\r\ntroops, supplies, stores and remounts), one light mail train, and, when\r\nnecessary, one ambulance train; though these conditions were improved\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\nThe _speed_ at which the trains ran--allowing for necessary stops in\r\nstations or at crossing places on the line--ranged from five to eleven\r\nmiles an hour, with seven miles an hour as a good average. For the\r\njourney from Warsaw to Mukden the military trains took forty days,\r\nincluding one day's rest for the troops at the end of every 600 or 700\r\nmiles. In April and May the journey from Wirballen, on the frontier\r\nof Russia and Germany, to Liao-yang, situate between Mukden and Port\r\nArthur, took fifty days--an average speed of five and a quarter miles\r\nper hour.\r\n\r\nWhat with the transport and other difficulties that arose, it was not\r\nfor three months after the outbreak of hostilities that the Russian\r\ntroops in the Ear East received reinforcements. It was not until after\r\nseven months of war that the three Army Corps sent from European Russia\r\nto join the field army were all concentrated in Manchuria.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions the Japanese, free to send their own armies by\r\nsea to the theatre of war, and able to concentrate them with far greater\r\nspeed, had all the initial advantage. The Russian reinforcements arrived\r\nin driblets, and they were either cut off as they came or, as regards,\r\nat least, the fighting from May 14 to October 14, provided only 21,000\r\nmen to replace 100,000 killed, wounded or sick; whereas the Japanese\r\nwere able to maintain a continuous flow of reinforcements to make good\r\ntheir own casualties.\r\n\r\nGeneral Kuropatkin is of opinion that if the Russians had been able\r\nto command better transport from the outset the whole course of the\r\ncampaign would have been changed. He thinks that even a single extra\r\nthrough troop train per day would have made a material difference, while\r\nthe running, from the start, of six trains a day would, he believes,\r\nhave secured for Russia alike the initiative and the victory. Referring\r\nto the Siberian and Eastern Chinese Railways he says:--\r\n\r\n    If these lines had been more efficient, we could have\r\n    brought up our troops more rapidly, and, as things turned out,\r\n    150,000 men concentrated at first would have been of far more\r\n    value to us than the 300,000 who were gradually assembled during\r\n    nine months, only to be sacrificed in detail.... If we had had a\r\n    better railway and had been able to mass at Liao-yang the number\r\n    specified, we should undoubtedly have won the day in spite of\r\n    our mistakes.\r\n\r\nKuropatkin himself certainly did all he could to improve the transport\r\nconditions. In a statement he submitted to the Tsar on March 7, 1904,\r\nhe declared that of all urgently pressing questions that of bettering\r\nthe railway communication between Russia and Siberia was the most\r\nimportant; and he added:--\"It must, therefore, be taken up at once, in\r\nspite of the enormous cost. The money expended will not be wasted; it\r\nwill, on the contrary, be in the highest sense productive inasmuch as it\r\nwill shorten the duration of the war.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Trans-Baikal section six new stations were added, and additional\r\ncrossing places to facilitate the passing of trains were provided\r\nelsewhere, so that by May some additional trains per day could be\r\nrun. In June orders were given by the Government for the execution of\r\nextensive works designed to increase the capacity of the Siberian and\r\nEastern Chinese main lines to seven trains per day in each direction,\r\nand that of the southern branch to twelve per day. The cost of these\r\nimprovements was estimated at £4,400,000.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1904, Kuropatkin submitted to the Tsar a recommendation\r\nthat the lines should be at once doubled throughout their whole length.\r\nThe reinforcements, he declared, were even then still coming in\r\ndriblets. \"Supplies despatched in the spring are still on the Siberian\r\nside. Waterproofs sent for the summer will arrive when we want fur\r\ncoats; fur coats will come to hand when waterproofs are wanted.\"\r\n\r\nThere was need, also, to provide stores of provisions for the troops. So\r\nlong as the army was a comparatively small one it could depend mainly on\r\nlocal resources. In proportion as it increased in size it became more\r\nand more dependent on supplies from European Russia; but the collection\r\nof a sufficiency for a single month meant the running of five extra\r\ntrains a day for a like period. Even when ample supplies were available\r\nat one point, weakness and inefficiency in the transport arrangements\r\nmight lead to the troops elsewhere suffering privations which should be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nWhether for financial or other reasons, the Russian Government did not\r\nadopt the idea of converting the single track of the railway system\r\ninto double track; but the improvements made in the traffic facilities\r\n(including the provision of sixty-nine additional places for the passing\r\nof trains) were such that by the time peace was concluded, on September\r\n5, 1905, the Russians had ten, or even twelve pairs of full-length\r\ntrains running in the twenty-four hours, as compared with the two per\r\nday which could alone be run six months before the outbreak of war and\r\nthe three per day which were running nine months later. The capacity of\r\nthe lines had been increased practically fourfold; though the general\r\nsituation remained such as to evoke the following comment from the\r\nwriter of the official German account of the war[48]:--\r\n\r\n    In spite of the efforts made to improve the line, the\r\n    connection of the Russian forces in East Asia with their home\r\n    country was, and remained, an unreliable and uncertain factor\r\n    in the calculations of Army Headquarters. No measures, were\r\n    they ever so energetic, could be designed to remove this\r\n    uncertainty, and it was only gradually, as the Manchurian Army\r\n    itself increased and concentrated, and as the railway works\r\n    advanced, that greater freedom of action was assured to the\r\n    Commander-in-Chief; but even then the army as a whole, with all\r\n    its wants and supplies, remained dependent on the Siberian and\r\n    Eastern Chinese Railways.\r\n\r\nWhat the railways did was to enable the Russians to collect at the\r\ntheatre of war, by the time the war itself came to an end, an army of\r\n1,000,000 men--of whom two-thirds had not yet been under fire--together\r\nwith machine-guns, howitzers, shells, small-arm ammunition, field\r\nrailways, wireless telegraphy, supplies, and technical stores of all\r\nkinds. Kuropatkin says of this achievement:--\r\n\r\n    The War Department had, with the co-operation of other\r\n    departments, successfully accomplished a most colossal task.\r\n    What single authority would have admitted a few years ago the\r\n    possibility of concentrating an army of a million men 5,400\r\n    miles away from its base of supply and equipment by means of a\r\n    poorly-constructed single-line railway? Wonders were effected;\r\n    but it was too late. Affairs in the interior of Russia for which\r\n    the War Department could not be held responsible were the cause\r\n    of the war being brought to an end at a time when decisive\r\n    military operations should really have only just been beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia, in fact, agreed to make peace at a time when the prospect of her\r\nbeing able to secure a victory was greater than it had been at any time\r\nduring the earlier phases of the war; but the Japanese failed to attain\r\nall they had hoped for, the primary causes of such failure, in spite\r\nof their repeated victories, being, as told in the British \"Official\r\nHistory\" of the war, that \"Port Arthur held out longer than had been\r\nexpected, and the Trans-Siberian Railway enabled Russia to place more\r\nmen in the field than had been thought possible.\"[49]\r\n\r\nThus, in respect to rail-power, at least, Russia still achieved a\r\nremarkable feat in her transport of an army so great a distance by a\r\nsingle-track line of railway. Such an achievement was unexampled, while,\r\nalthough Fate was against the ultimate success of her efforts, Russia\r\nprovided the world with a fresh object lesson as to what might have\r\nbeen done, in a campaign waged more than 5,000 miles from the base of\r\nsupplies, if only the line of rail communication had been equal from the\r\nfirst to the demands it was called upon to meet.\r\n\r\nApart from this main consideration, there were some other phases of the\r\nRusso-Japanese War which are of interest from the point of view of the\r\npresent study.\r\n\r\nThe _Field railways_, mentioned on the previous page, constituted a\r\nnetwork of, altogether, 250 miles of narrow-gauge railways built and\r\noperated by the Russian troops--either alone or with the help of Chinese\r\nlabourers--and designed to act as subsidiary arteries of the broad-gauge\r\nEastern Chinese Railway by (1) providing for the transport therefrom of\r\ntroops and supplies to the front; (2) conveying guns and munitions to\r\nthe siege batteries, and (3) bringing back the sick and wounded. Horses,\r\nponies and mules were employed for traction purposes. Each of the three\r\nRussian armies in the field had its own group of narrow-gauge lines,\r\nand the lines themselves served a most useful purpose in a country of\r\nprimitive roads and inadequate local means of transport.\r\n\r\nIn one instance a broad-gauge branch line was built inland, during the\r\ncourse of the war, from the Eastern Chinese Railway for a distance of\r\ntwenty-five miles. A depôt was set up at its terminus, and thence the\r\nsupplies were conveyed to the troops by a series of narrow-gauge lines\r\nextending to every part of that particular section of the theatre of war.\r\n\r\nConstruction of the narrow-gauge line serving the Second Army, and\r\nextending nineteen miles from a point on the Eastern Chinese Railway\r\nnear to Port Arthur, necessitated the provision of six bridges and three\r\nembankments. Three lines, the building of which was begun in January,\r\n1905, were siege lines specially designed to serve the positions taken\r\nup at Liao-yang; but all three were abandoned on the evacuation of\r\nMukden, early in March. It was, however, subsequent to the retreat from\r\nMukden that the greatest degree of energy in constructing narrow-gauge\r\nlines was shown by the Russians. In addition to the 250 miles brought\r\ninto use, there was still another 100 miles completed; but these could\r\nnot be operated owing to the inadequate supply of wagons--a supply\r\nreduced still further through seizures made by the Japanese.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the war the traffic carried on these military\r\nnarrow-gauge lines included over 58,000 tons of provisions, stores,\r\netc., 75,132 sick and wounded, and 24,786 other troops.[50]\r\n\r\nFor the carrying out of all this construction work, and, also, for the\r\noperation of the Manchurian and Ussuri railways, Russia had twenty-four\r\ncompanies of _Railway Troops_, the total force of which was estimated\r\nat 11,431. In the first part of the war she relied upon her six East\r\nSiberian Railway Battalions. As the work increased other Battalions were\r\nbrought from European Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese were not well provided with Railway Troops; but they were\r\nnone the less active in endeavouring to destroy the Russian lines of\r\ncommunication, on which so much depended. For instance, the railway\r\nto Port Arthur was cut by them near Wa-fang-tien at 11 p.m. on May 6.\r\nThe Russians repaired the line, and by May 10 a further train-load of\r\nammunition was sent over it into Port Arthur. Three days later the\r\nJapanese cut the line at another point, and from that time Port Arthur\r\nwas isolated.\r\n\r\nAs regards the _operation_ of the Siberian and Eastern Chinese Railways,\r\nColonel W. H. H. Waters says:--[51]\r\n\r\n    Taking the railway as a whole, from Chelyabinsk, which is\r\n    the western terminus of the Siberian portion, to Mukden, a\r\n    distance of close upon 4,000 miles, it has worked better than I\r\n    expected; but the one great fault connected with it has been,\r\n    and is, the incapacity of Russian railwaymen, civil or military,\r\n    to handle heavy station traffic properly. If Russia were to pay\r\n    a British or American goods-yard foreman, say from Nine Elms\r\n    station, a salary, no matter how high, and let him import his\r\n    own staff of assistants, the improvement of the Asiatic lines in\r\n    question would be remarkable.\r\n\r\nThen, again, Captain C. E. Vickers, R.E., writing on \"The Siberian\r\nRailway in War,\" in the issue of \"The Royal Engineers Journal\" (Chatham)\r\nfor August, 1905, points to the need which was developed for the\r\n_control_ of the railway during war by a separate staff, as distinct\r\nfrom the staffs concerned in arranging operations, distributing supplies\r\nand munitions, and other military duties.\r\n\r\nWhether due to the personal incapacity spoken of by the one authority\r\nhere quoted, or to the lack of a separate organisation alluded to by the\r\nother, the fact remains that the operation of the Siberian and Eastern\r\nChinese lines did give rise to a degree of confusion that must have\r\ngreatly increased the difficulties of the position in which the Russians\r\nwere placed.\r\n\r\nWhen, for example, in September, 1904, reservists were urgently\r\nwanted at Mukden after the retreat from Liao-yang, the traffic was so\r\nmismanaged that it took the troops seven days to do the 337 miles from\r\nHarbin--an average speed of two miles per hour. On December 5, Harbin\r\nJunction was so blocked in all directions by trains which could neither\r\nmove in nor go out that traffic had to be suspended for twelve hours\r\nuntil the entanglement was set right. Still further, after the fall of\r\nPort Arthur, on January 2, 1905, and the augmentation of the Japanese\r\nforces by Nogi's army, the arrival of reinforcements then so greatly\r\nneeded by the Russians was delayed for over one month to allow of the\r\nforwarding of a quantity of stores which had accumulated on the line.\r\n\r\nSome, at least, of the difficulties and delays experienced in operation\r\nwere undoubtedly due to developments of that _interference by individual\r\nofficers_ with the working of the railways of which we have already had\r\nstriking examples in the case of the American War of Secession and the\r\nFranco-German War of 1870-71. Colonel Waters writes on this subject:--\r\n\r\n    It is interesting to note how the working of the line was\r\n    interfered with by those who should have been the first to see\r\n    that no extraneous calls were made upon it when the organisation\r\n    of the army and the strengthening of Port Arthur were of vital\r\n    importance.\r\n\r\n    The chief of the Viceroy's Staff was the intermediary\r\n    between Admiral Alexeiev and General Kuropatkin, the former\r\n    being at Mukden and the latter at Liao-yang, thirty-seven miles\r\n    distant. Frequent conferences took place between Kuropatkin\r\n    and this officer, who always used to come in a special train\r\n    to Liao-yang. This necessitated the line being kept clear for\r\n    indefinite periods of time and dislocated all the other traffic\r\n    arrangements, as the then chief of the railways himself declared.\r\n\r\n    In the first days of May, 1904, the Viceroy and the Grand\r\n    Duke Boris were at Port Arthur, and wished to leave it before\r\n    they should be cut off. I heard that they actually took three\r\n    special trains to quit Port Arthur, namely, one for each of\r\n    them, and one for their baggage and stores. This entirely upset\r\n    the troop train, supply and ammunition services, at a time,\r\n    too, when the scarcity of heavy gun munition in the fortress was\r\n    such that, within a week, Kuropatkin called for volunteers to\r\n    run a train-load through, which was done a few hours only before\r\n    the place was definitely invested.\r\n\r\n    There were, throughout 1904, plenty of other instances\r\n    of special trains being run for, and siding accommodation\r\n    occupied by, various individuals, so that the organisation and\r\n    maintenance of the army was considerably hampered thereby.\r\n\r\nThese experiences simply confirm the wisdom of the action which other\r\ncountries had already taken (1) to ensure the efficient operation of\r\nrailways in time of war by staffs comprising the military and the\r\ntechnical elements in combination, and (2) to prevent the interference\r\nof the former in the details of the actual working by the latter.\r\n\r\nRussia was, in fact, distinctly behind Western nations in these respects\r\nin 1904-5, and the need for placing her military transport system on a\r\nsounder basis was among the many lessons she learnt--and acted upon--as\r\nthe result of her experiences in the war with Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] \"The Russo-Japanese War.

They approximate to commercial lines in construction,\r\nequipment and operation, and they are worked in connection with them\r\nfor the ordinary purposes of trade and travel; though in their case any\r\nconsiderations as to whether the traffic they carry is remunerative\r\ndoes not arise, provided only that they are capable of fulfilling\r\ntheir real purpose--that, namely, of ensuring such military transports\r\nas may, sooner or later, be required of them. It is possible that in\r\ntimes of peace the amount of actual traffic passing over them will\r\nbe comparatively small, if not even practically _nil_, and that many\r\nyears may elapse before the special facilities they must necessarily\r\noffer,--such as extensive siding accommodation and long platforms for\r\nthe loading and unloading of troop trains--are likely to be employed to\r\nthe fullest extent; but they nevertheless form an integral part both\r\nof the railway system and of the military system of the country, and,\r\nhaving been constructed, they are, at least, available for military\r\npurposes whenever wanted.\r\n\r\nOne must, however, again bear in mind that a railway built to meet\r\nthe ordinary requirements of trade and travel does not become a\r\n\"strategical\" any more than a \"military\" railway simply because, in\r\ntime of war, it is used, to whatever extent, for the conveyance of\r\ntroops, supplies or war material. The essential factor in each instance\r\nis, not the use that is made of the line, but the particular, or, at\r\nleast, the main object it has been built to serve. Just, also, as a\r\ncommercial line remains a commercial line notwithstanding its use for\r\nmilitary traffic, so, in turn, a strategical line remains a strategical\r\nline whatever the amount of civilian traffic it may carry in time of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nYet while the distinction thus drawn between general railways and\r\nstrategical railways is abundantly warranted, the increase of the former\r\nmay still have an important bearing on the operation of the latter\r\nbecause of the improvement of transport facilities in the interior,\r\nand because of the greater amount of rolling stock which will be made\r\navailable for war purposes. \"From a military point of view,\" said von\r\nMoltke in the Prussian Herrenhaus on March 26, 1876, \"every railway is\r\nwelcome, and two are still more welcome than one\"; and he developed\r\nthis idea in a further speech on December 17, 1879, when, in declaring\r\nthat the ownership and operation of the leading Prussian railways was\r\ndesirable from a military standpoint, he said:--[52]\r\n\r\n    Railways have become, in our time, one of the most essential\r\n    instruments for the conduct of war. The transport of large\r\n    bodies of troops to a given point is an extremely complicated\r\n    and comprehensive piece of work, to which continuous attention\r\n    must be paid. Every fresh railway junction makes a difference,\r\n    while, although we may not want to make use of every railway\r\n    line that has been constructed, we may still want to make use of\r\n    the whole of the rolling stock that is available.\r\n\r\nAnother important distinction between military and strategical railways\r\nis that whereas the building of the former will be governed primarily\r\nby military requirements, that of the latter may be fundamentally due\r\nto considerations of State policy. Strategical railways are wanted\r\nto serve the purposes of national defence or, alternatively, of\r\nnational expansion. They are especially provided to ensure the speedy\r\nconcentration of troops on the frontier, whether to resist invasion by\r\na neighbouring country or to facilitate the invasion either of that\r\ncountry or, it may be, of territory on the other side thereof. The fact\r\nthat they have been built may, in some cases, even further the interests\r\nof peace, should the increased means they offer for military transports\r\nrender the country concerned a more formidable antagonist than it\r\nmight otherwise be, and influence the policy of other States or lands\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nIn tropical dependencies the building of railways as a practical proof\r\nof \"effective occupation\" is often regarded as preferable to military\r\nconquest, being likely, in most cases, to answer the same purpose while\r\noffering many other advantages, besides. In West Africa there are not\r\nonly railways of this class but others that have, in addition, been\r\ndesigned as a precautionary measure against a not impossible invasion,\r\nat some future date, by Mohammedan tribes from North Central Africa. All\r\nsuch lines as these belong to the strategical type, though they may,\r\nalso, serve an important part in furthering the economic development of\r\nthe territories concerned.\r\n\r\nStrategical railways, whether designed for defensive or aggressive\r\npurposes, may, in turn, be divided into two main groups, (1) those that\r\nconstitute a network of lines; and (2) single or individual lines for\r\nshort or long distances.\r\n\r\nA network of strategical railways is generally found in direct\r\nassociation with frontiers. Single or individual strategical lines fall\r\ninto various groups including (1) short lines or branches running out\r\nto some point on or near to a frontier; (2) single lines carried for\r\nlong distances, and, possibly, crossing entire continents; (3) circular\r\nor short lines, connecting different railway systems with one another,\r\nin order to facilitate the movement of troops during mobilisation or\r\nconcentration or for defensive purposes in the event of invasion; (4)\r\nlines passing round cities or large towns in order to avoid delay of\r\ntroop trains; and (5) lines for coast defence.\r\n\r\nThe ideal conditions for a network of strategical railways was already\r\na subject of discussion in Germany in 1842, when Pönitz brought\r\nforward his proposal that that country should provide herself with\r\nsuch a system. There were, he said, theorists who designed, on paper,\r\nstrategical railways which, starting from a common centre, radiated in\r\nstraight lines to different points on the frontier and were connected\r\nwith one another by parallel or intersecting lines of railway on the\r\nprinciple of a geometrical design, or, he might have added, of a\r\nspider's web. Pönitz admitted the excellence of the idea, suggesting\r\nthat if there were, indeed, a group of lines to the frontier connected\r\nby cross lines allowing of a complete interchange of traffic, the enemy\r\nwould never know at what point a sudden advance in force might not be\r\nmade, while the linking up of the entire system would greatly facilitate\r\nworking.\r\n\r\nIn practice, however, as he proceeded to point out, this ideal system\r\ncould not be fully adopted, partly because the planning of railways is\r\ninfluenced by the configuration of the country, which may not permit\r\nof geometrical designs for iron roads; and partly because the trunk\r\nlines of national systems of rail communication had already been laid\r\nby private enterprise on the principle of catering for the social and\r\neconomic needs of the community and of returning interest on capital\r\nexpenditure, rather than of serving military or political purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the proposals which Pönitz himself advanced for providing Germany\r\nwith a complete network of strategical lines he sought to combine, as\r\nfar as possible, the commercial and the military principle; though the\r\nsubsequent predominance, in most countries, of the economic element in\r\nregard to railways in general strengthened the force of his contention\r\nthat an ideal system was not necessarily a practicable one. The\r\nsuggested geometrical design was, nevertheless, not lost sight of,\r\nand it continued to be regarded as the plan that should, at least, be\r\nfollowed in respect to strategical railways, as far as circumstances\r\nwould permit.\r\n\r\nDealing with this particular subject in his \"Geschichte und System\r\nder Eisenbahnbenutzung im Kriege\" (Leipzig, 1896), Dr. Josef Joesten\r\nincluded the following among the conditions which, theoretically\r\nand practically, should enable a railway system to respond to the\r\nnecessities of war:--\r\n\r\n1. To each of the strategical fronts of the national territory there\r\nshould be the largest possible number of railway lines, all independent\r\nthe one of the other.\r\n\r\n2. The converging lines terminating at the bases of concentration, and\r\nmore especially those leading to the coast or to great navigable rivers,\r\nshould be crossed by numerous transverse lines in order to allow of the\r\nrapid passing of troops from any one of the lines of concentration to\r\nany other.\r\n\r\n3. Positions or localities having a recognised strategical value should\r\nbe selected as the places where the two types of lines should cross, and\r\nthese intersection points, when they are near to the frontier, should\r\nthemselves be protected by fortifications serving as _points d'appui_\r\nfor movements of advance or retirement.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that, if the building of railways in Germany had been\r\nleft entirely to the State from the outset, these principles would have\r\nbeen generally followed there; but in Prussia the private lines taken\r\nover as the result of the policy of nationalisation adopted by that\r\ncountry--the total length of those acquired since 1872 being now nearly\r\n10,000 miles--had been originally constructed to serve, not strategic,\r\nbut economic purposes, and, more especially, the industrial interests\r\nof Westphalia and the Rhineland, the Government having been left by\r\nprivate enterprise to provide, not alone the strategical lines, but,\r\nalso, the lines that were wanted to serve the less promising economic\r\nrequirements, of Eastern Prussia. To say, therefore, as some writers\r\nhave done, that the Prussian--if not the German--railways as a whole\r\nhave been designed to serve military purposes is erroneous. It is none\r\nthe less true that the adoption of the principle of State ownership\r\nconferred alike on Prussia and on other German States a great advantage\r\nin enabling them both to build strategical lines as, ostensibly, part\r\nof the ordinary railway system and to adapt existing lines to military\r\npurposes so far as conditions allowed and occasion might require.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances any close adherence to ideal systems has, indeed,\r\nnot been practicable; yet the activity shown in Germany in providing\r\neither new or adapted strategical lines of railway has been beyond all\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nSuch activity has been especially manifest since the Franco-German war\r\nof 1870-1. It is, indeed, the case that during the last twenty-five\r\nyears there have been constant representations by Prussian trading\r\ninterests that the railways in Westphalia and Rhineland, numerous\r\nas they might appear to be, were unequal to the industrial needs\r\nof those districts. The reasons for these conditions were that the\r\nAdministration, eager to secure railway \"profits,\" had neglected to\r\nprovide adequately for improvements, widenings and extensions of\r\nline, and for additions to rolling stock. No one, however, is likely\r\nto suggest that Prussia has shown any lack of enterprise in the\r\nconstruction of strategical lines which would enable her to concentrate\r\ngreat masses of troops on her frontiers with the utmost dispatch. \"The\r\nrivalry between neighbouring States,\" writes von der Goltz in \"The\r\nConduct of War,\" \"has had the effect of causing perfectly new lines\r\nto be constructed solely for military reasons. Strategical railways\r\nconstitute a special feature of our time\"; and in no country has this\r\nfact been recognised more clearly, and acted upon more thoroughly, than\r\nin Germany.\r\n\r\nIt would, nevertheless, be a mistake to attempt to form a reliable\r\nestimate of the situation, from a strategical point of view, on the\r\nbasis of the ordinary German railway maps, and certain reproductions\r\nthereof recently offered in the English Press have been wholly\r\nmisleading. Not only may these maps be hopelessly out of date--one, for\r\ninstance, that was published in a military journal in the autumn of 1914\r\ncontained none of the strategical lines built by Prussia since 1900\r\nfor troop movements in the direction of Belgium--but they invariably\r\ndraw no distinction between State-owned lines which do come into\r\nconsideration in regard to military transports and agricultural or other\r\nlines--including many narrow-gauge ones--which serve local purposes\r\nonly and are still owned by private companies, the State not having\r\nthought it necessary in the general interest to take them over.\r\n\r\nA more accurate idea of the real bearings of German railways on the\r\nmilitary and strategical situation can be gathered from the large map\r\n(\"Kartenbeilage I\") which accompanies the \"Bericht\" presented to the\r\nKaiser, in 1911, by the Prussian Minister of Public Works under the\r\ntitle of \"Die Verwaltung der öffentlichen Arbeiten in Preussen, 1900 bis\r\n1910.\" On this map a clear distinction is drawn between State-owned and\r\ncompany-owned lines, while difference in colouring shows the additions\r\nmade to the State system during the decade either by construction of new\r\nlines or by State acquisition of existing lines.\r\n\r\nOne especially noticeable feature brought out by this map is the fact\r\nthat, in addition to the innumerable railway lines built either to the\r\nfrontiers or establishing intercommunication and exchange of traffic\r\nbetween those lines themselves, there is an almost unbroken series\r\nrunning parallel to the coasts of _Pomerania_ and _East Prussia_, and\r\nthence southward all along and close to the frontiers of Russia and\r\nRussian Poland. In this way troops can be moved, not only by different\r\nroutes _to_ many points along the Baltic coast or the Russian frontier,\r\nbut, also, _from_ one of these coastal or frontier points direct to\r\nanother, as may be desired.\r\n\r\nThe strategical significance of this arrangement is sufficiently\r\nobvious; but any possible doubt as to the purpose aimed at is removed\r\nby some observations thereon made by Joesten, who further says in his\r\n\"Geschichte und System der Eisenbahnbenutzung im Kriege\":--\r\n\r\n    If it is true that, generally speaking, the best\r\n    railways for general purposes constitute excellent lines of\r\n    communication for armies, it is no less true that good, or\r\n    very good, strategical lines cannot, and ought not to, in all\r\n    cases constitute good commercial lines. In support of this\r\n    assertion one can refer to the immense extent of railway lines\r\n    on the coasts of Pomerania. These lines, which are of the\r\n    first importance from a strategical point of view, have only\r\n    a moderate value from a commercial standpoint, considering\r\n    that they do not connect the interior of the country with any\r\n    district providing goods or passenger traffic on a material\r\n    scale, and only provide means of communication between\r\n    localities having identical needs.\r\n\r\nWhat is thus admitted in regard to the coastal railways of Pomerania\r\napplies no less to many, if not to most, of the frontier lines in East\r\nPrussia, West Prussia and Silesia.\r\n\r\nNot only, again, is the number of German lines going to the frontiers,\r\nand no farther, out of all proportion to the number of those providing\r\nfor international communication, but the map on which these observations\r\nare based shows that between 1900 and 1910 there were added to the\r\nPrussian State system many lines which (1) established additional\r\ntransverse links between those already going to the Russian frontier,\r\n(2) provided alternative routes thereto, or (3) supplemented the\r\nlines which skirt the frontier, a few miles inland, by branches going\r\ntherefrom to strategic points actually on the frontier itself.\r\n\r\nAs against this construction of an elaborate network of strategical\r\nlines towards and along _the Russian frontier_, there must be put the\r\nfact that although, by this means, Germany acquired the power to effect\r\na great and speedy concentration of troops on the frontier itself, her\r\nlocomotives and rolling stock would not be able to cross into Russia and\r\nrun on the railways there because of _the difference in gauge_. On the\r\neastern frontier the question as to how an invasion in large force could\r\nbe effected was, consequently, quite different from that which would\r\npresent itself on the western frontiers, where the railway gauges of\r\nBelgium, Luxemburg and France were the same as those of Germany.\r\n\r\nIt was certain that whenever, in the event of war, German troops were\r\nable to enter Russian territory, Russia would withdraw into the interior\r\nor else destroy such of her locomotives and rolling stock as the enemy\r\nmight otherwise utilise for his own purpose. If, therefore, the Germans\r\nwanted to use the existing Russian lines, they would either have to\r\nbuild, in advance, locomotives and rolling stock capable of running\r\nthereon, or they would have to convert the Russian gauge of 5 feet to\r\nthe German gauge of 4 feet 8½ inches, so that German trains could run\r\non the other side of the frontier. As already remarked on page 61, the\r\nreduction of the broader gauge into a narrower one would involve fewer\r\nengineering difficulties than an expansion of the German gauge into the\r\nRussian gauge; yet even the former procedure, if carried out over any\r\nconsiderable length of line, would take up a good deal of time, and\r\nthis would be still more the case if the Russians, when they retreated,\r\ndestroyed the railway track and bridges behind them, as they might\r\nconfidently be expected to do.\r\n\r\nDependence, again, on the existing lines across the frontier would,\r\napart from questions of conversion and reconstruction, still give\r\nGermany only a very small number of railway routes into Russia, and\r\nthese, also, at points where the opposition offered might be especially\r\nactive.\r\n\r\nWhat, in these circumstances, Germany evidently planned to do as soon\r\nas her troops crossed the frontier, in the event of a war with Russia,\r\nwas to supplement the strategical lines on her own side of that frontier\r\nby military light railways which, laid on the ordinary roads, or on\r\nclearances to be effected, on Russian territory, would render her\r\nindependent of the ordinary railways there, while offering the further\r\nadvantage (1) that the laying of these narrow-gauge military lines--in\r\nrough and ready fashion, yet in a way that would answer the purposes of\r\nthe moment--could be effected in shorter time than the gauge-conversion\r\nand the reconstruction of the Russian trunk lines would take; and (2)\r\nthat these military railways could be built from any points along\r\nthe frontier which were capable of being reached direct from the\r\nGerman strategical lines, and offered either an existing road or the\r\nopportunity of making one for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the light of this assumption, one can understand more clearly the\r\nreason for those short lines which, branching out from the German\r\nstrategical railways that run parallel to the Russian frontier though\r\nsome miles from it, are carried to the frontier and there suddenly stop.\r\nIt was, presumably, from such terminal points as these that the laying\r\nof the military railways on Russian territory would begin.\r\n\r\nAs regards the type of railways to be employed and the preparations made\r\nin advance for supplying and constructing them, we have the testimony of\r\nMr. Roy Norton, an American writer, who says in \"The Man of Peace\"--one\r\nof the \"Oxford Pamphlets, 1914-15,\" published by the Oxford University\r\nPress:--\r\n\r\n    On February 14 of this year (1914) I was in Cologne, and\r\n    blundered, where I had no business, into what I learned was\r\n    a military-stores yard. Among other curious things were tiny\r\n    locomotives loaded on flats which could be run off those cars\r\n    by an ingenious contrivance of metals, or, as we call them in\r\n    America, rails. Also there were other flats loaded with sections\r\n    of tracks fastened on cup ties (sleepers that can be laid on the\r\n    surface of the earth) and sections of miniature bridges on other\r\n    flats. I saw how it was possible to lay a line of temporary\r\n    railway, including bridges, almost anywhere in an incredibly\r\n    short space of time, if one had the men.... Before I could\r\n    conclude my examination I discovered that I was on _verboten_\r\n    ground; but the official who directed me out told me that what I\r\n    had seen were construction outfits.\r\n\r\nMr. Norton further quotes the following from a letter he had just\r\nreceived from a Hollander who was a refugee in Germany at the outbreak\r\nof the war, and reached home on August 30, 1914:--\r\n\r\n    Never, I believe, did a country so thoroughly get ready\r\n    for war. I saw the oddest spectacle, the building of a railway\r\n    behind a battle-field. They had diminutive little engines and\r\n    rails in sections, so that they could be bolted together, and\r\n    even bridges that could be put across ravines in a twinkling.\r\n    Flat cars that could be carried by hand and dropped on the\r\n    rails, great strings of them. Up to the nearest point of battle\r\n    came, on the regular railway, this small one.... It seemed to\r\n    me that hundreds of men had been trained for this task, for in\r\n    but a few minutes that small portable train was buzzing backward\r\n    and forward on its own small portable rails, distributing food\r\n    and supplies.... I've an idea that in time of battle it would\r\n    be possible for those sturdy little trains to shift troops to\r\n    critical or endangered points at the rate of perhaps twenty\r\n    miles an hour.... A portable railway for a battle-field struck\r\n    me as coming about as close to making war by machinery as\r\n    anything I have ever heard of.\r\n\r\nOne may thus reasonably conclude, in regard to the Russo-German\r\nfrontier, (1) that the broader gauge of the Russian railways would\r\nitself offer no real obstacle to the German troops whenever the time\r\ncame for their invading Russian territory; (2) that in this eventuality\r\nthe Germans would be able, by reason of the preparations made by them in\r\nadvance, to lay down along the ordinary Russian roads lines of military\r\nlight railways already put together in complete sections of combined\r\nrails and sleepers, which sections would only require to be fastened\r\nthe one to the other to be at once ready for use; and (3) that these\r\nportable military railways, to be built on Russian territory, were\r\ndesigned both to supplement and to render still more efficient Germany's\r\nnetwork of strategical railways along her eastern frontier.\r\n\r\nIn _southern Silesia_ many improvements in the rail communication with\r\nAustria were made in 1900-10. New connections were established with the\r\nfrontier railways, offering alternative routes from interior points,\r\nwhile various lines which stopped short of the frontier were extended to\r\nit and linked up with Austrian lines on the other side.\r\n\r\nIn her relations with _France_, Germany's efforts to improve still\r\nfurther her rail communications to the eastern and north-eastern\r\nfrontiers of that country have been continuous since the war of 1870-1,\r\non which campaign she started with a great advantage over the French\r\nsince she was able to concentrate her troops on those frontiers by\r\nnine different routes, namely, six in North Germany, and three in\r\nSouth Germany, whereas France herself had then only three available.\r\nThe course adopted by Germany has been (1) to secure a larger number\r\nof routes to the French frontier, South Germany's three lines, for\r\ninstance, being increased to six; (2) to provide double track, or to\r\nsubstitute double for single track, for lines leading to the frontier\r\nand having a strategical importance; (3) to construct lines which\r\ncross transversely those proceeding direct to the French frontiers,\r\nthus allowing of intercommunication and transfer of traffic from one\r\nto another; and (4) improvement of the interior network of lines,\r\nwith a view to facilitating military transport services in time of\r\nwar. \"Altogether,\" says Joesten, \"we have nineteen points at which\r\nour railways cross the Rhine, and sixteen double-track lines for the\r\ntransport of our troops from east to west, as against the nine which\r\nwere alone available for concentration in 1870.\"\r\n\r\nWhile showing all this activity on the immediate frontiers of France,\r\nGermany was no less zealous in providing alternative routes for a fresh\r\ninvasion of French territory, the adoption of this further policy being\r\nobviously inspired by the energy that France was herself showing in the\r\nstrengthening of her north-east frontier against invasion.\r\n\r\nOne such alternative route was represented by _Luxemburg_. Not only\r\ndid Germany have lines of her own on the north, south, and east of\r\nLuxemburg, but the lines within the Grand Duchy itself had passed under\r\nGerman control; and if Germany thought fit to disregard her treaty\r\nobligations, and use the lines for strategical purposes, Luxemburg was\r\npowerless to prevent her from so doing.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative route was by way of _Belgium_; and the various\r\ndevelopments of Germany's railway policy on the Belgian frontier since\r\n1908 point in an unmistakable manner to deliberate preparation on her\r\npart for an invasion of that country, whether for the purpose of passing\r\nthrough it, as a means of reaching a more vulnerable part of French\r\nterritory than the strongly fortified north-east corner, or in pursuance\r\nof designs against Belgium itself.\r\n\r\nThe full story of Germany's activity in this direction will be found in\r\na series of articles from the _Fortnightly Review_ reproduced by the\r\nauthor, Mr. Demetrius C. Boulger, in \"England's Arch-Enemy: A Collection\r\nof Essays forming an Indictment of German Policy during the last sixteen\r\nyears\" (London, 1914).[53]\r\n\r\nThe story opens with the establishment by Germany, about the year 1896,\r\nof a camp at Elsenborn, ten miles north-east of Malmédy, a town situate\r\nclose to the Belgian frontier and four miles from the Belgian town of\r\nStavelot. The camp was begun on a small scale, and at the outset the\r\nestablishment of it on the site in question was declared by the Prussian\r\nauthorities to have no strategical significance. It steadily developed,\r\nhowever, in size and importance, and its position, character and\r\nsurroundings all suggested that it was designed for aggressive rather\r\nthan defensive purposes.\r\n\r\nAt first the camp was reached from Hellenthal, a station, fourteen miles\r\naway, on a light railway connected with the lines in the Eifel district,\r\nbetween Cologne and Treves (Trier), on the Moselle; but in 1896 a light\r\nrailway was constructed from Aix-la-Chapelle parallel with the Belgian\r\nfrontier as far as St. Vith, a distance of fifty miles, the main purpose\r\nof this line being stated to be the securing of a better connection,\r\nfrom Sourbrodt, for the camp at Elsenborn. The line was, nevertheless,\r\nextended to Trois Vièrges (Ger. Uflingen), where it connected both\r\nwith the railway system of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg and with the\r\nmain lines of the Belgian System from Pepinster, via Spa, Stavelot,\r\nTrois Ponts and Gouvy, to Trois Vièrges. From Trois Ponts there is a\r\ndirect route to Liége, while Gouvy, situate only a few miles from Trois\r\nVièrges, is the junction both for Libramont, on the main line from\r\nBrussels to Metz and Alsace, and for the further junction of Beatrix,\r\nthe central point of a Belgian line running parallel with the French\r\nfrontier from Dinant to Luxemburg.\r\n\r\nThe single-track line from Aix-la-Chapelle along the Belgian frontier,\r\nsupplemented by a light-railway branch from Weismes to Malmédy, met all\r\nthe traffic requirements of a scantily-populated and primitive district,\r\ndevoid alike of industries and of local resources, and offering very\r\nlittle traffic; but in 1908 the Prussian Government suddenly decided\r\nto double the line, first as far as Weismes, and then to St. Vith,\r\nnotwithstanding that there was no apparent justification for such a\r\nprocedure. The widening involved, also, the reconstruction of a high\r\nembankment originally designed for one set of metals, a fact which\r\nshowed that only a few years previously--since when the local traffic\r\nhad not materially increased--there was no idea that a double-track\r\nline would ever be wanted. Still more significant was the fact that, in\r\naddition to the second set of metals, sidings were provided on such a\r\nscale at the stations _en route_, in localities possessing only a dozen\r\nor so of cottages, that, in the aggregate, trains containing a complete\r\nArmy Corps could have been accommodated on them. At one station three\r\nsidings, each about 500 yards long, were supplied, and at another a\r\nperfect network of sidings was constructed, including two which were at\r\nleast half a mile long and were, also, equipped with turntables.[54]\r\n\r\nThe provision, more especially, of sidings such as these at local\r\nstations where the trains were few and far between and the ordinary\r\nmerchandise was represented by some occasional coal trucks, could have\r\nbut one purpose. They were obviously designed--in conjunction with\r\nthe substitution of double for single track--to permit of a large\r\nbody of troops, whether from Aix-la-Chapelle (an important point of\r\nconcentration for the Prussian Army, on mobilisation), or elsewhere,\r\nbeing assembled in the immediate neighbourhood of Weismes, the junction\r\nof the branch line to Malmédy, for an invasion of Belgium. The doubling\r\nof the rails as far as Weismes was completed by May, 1909. It was\r\nafterwards continued to St. Vith, and so on to Trois Vièrges.\r\n\r\nWe have thus far, however, got only the first chapter of the story. The\r\nsecond opens with the further attempt of the Prussian Government to\r\nsecure an extension of the Weismes-Malmédy line as a \"light railway\"\r\nacross the frontier to Stavelot, three miles east of Trois Ponts, thus\r\ngiving a shorter route from Aix-la-Chapelle and the camp at Elsenborn\r\nto Liége, Namur, Louvain and Brussels, and a second route to Gouvy for\r\nLibramont, Bertrix and the north of France.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the influence they were able to bring to bear on them,\r\nthe Germans succeeded in persuading the Belgian Government, not only to\r\nagree to the Weismes-Malmédy branch being continued to Stavelot, but\r\nthemselves to build the greater part of this connecting link, and even\r\nto cut, on the north of Stavelot, a tunnel without which that town would\r\nhave remained inaccessible by rail.\r\n\r\nOnce more there could be no suggestion that this connecting link, opened\r\nin October, 1913, was wanted in the interests of the ordinary traffic,\r\nthe needs of which were adequately met by the diligence running twice\r\na day between Malmédy and Stavelot. What was really aimed at was a\r\nrail connection with the Belgian system by means of which the troops\r\nconcentrated in those extensive sidings on the Aix-la-Chapelle-St.\r\nVith line could be poured into Belgium in a continuous stream for the\r\nachievement of designs on Belgium or--operating from either the Belgian\r\nor the Luxemburg frontier--on France.\r\n\r\nIn helping to provide this connection, Belgium, as subsequent events\r\nwere to show, was in a position akin to that of a man forced to dig\r\nthe grave in which he is to be buried after being shot; but Belgium,\r\nwe are told, \"yielded in this and other matters because she could not\r\nresist without support, and no support was forthcoming.\" There certainly\r\nwas an attempt to lull possible suspicions by the designation of the\r\nMalmédy-Stavelot link as a \"light railway.\" It was, also, evident that\r\nthe physical conditions of the Weismes-Malmédy branch, with which it\r\nwas to connect, would not permit of any heavy traffic along it. But\r\nthe so-called \"light railway\" was built with the same gauge as the\r\nmain-line systems on each side of the frontier; the powers obtained in\r\nrespect to it allowed of trains being run at a speed of forty miles an\r\nhour, as against the recognised speed of sixteen miles an hour on light\r\nrailways proper; while no sooner had the link been established than\r\nGermany discarded the defective Weismes-Malmédy branch for the purposes\r\nof military transport, and built a new line from Malmédy to Weywertz,\r\na station to the north or north-east of Weismes. This Malmédy-Weywertz\r\nbranch would, it was understood, be used exclusively for military\r\ntraffic, and the station at Weywertz was, in due course, provided with\r\nits own extensive platforms and network of sidings for the accommodation\r\nof troop trains.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the third chapter of the story; and here we learn that\r\nwhat was happening in the immediate proximity of the German-Belgian\r\nfrontier was but part of a much wider scheme, though one still designed\r\nto serve the same purpose--that, namely, of ensuring the invasion of\r\nBelgium by German troops with the greatest facility and in the least\r\npossible time.\r\n\r\nFrom Weywertz, the new junction for Stavelot and the Belgian railways\r\nin general, the Germans built a line to Jünkerath, a station north of\r\nGerolstein, on the line from Cologne to Treves. Then from Blankenheim,\r\nimmediately north of Jünkerath, and from Lissendorf, on the south\r\nof the same station, there were opened for traffic, in July, 1912,\r\nnew double-track lines which, meeting at Dümpelfeld, on the existing\r\nRemagen-Adenau line, gave a through route for troops from the Rhine,\r\nacross the Eifel district to Weywertz, and so on to Stavelot for\r\ndestinations (in war-time) throughout Belgium, Luxemburg, or along the\r\nnorthern frontier of France.\r\n\r\nThis direct route to Belgium offered the further advantage that it\r\navoided any necessity for troops from the Rhine to pass through\r\nCologne, where much congestion might otherwise occur. It also left\r\nthe Aix-la-Chapelle-Weywertz route free for troops from Cologne and\r\nWestphalia, while a further improvement of the facilities for crossing\r\nthe Rhine made Remagen still more accessible for troops from all parts\r\nof Central Germany destined for Belgium--and beyond.\r\n\r\nReference to the Prussian State Railways official map shows, also, (1)\r\na new line from Coblenz which joins, at Mayen, the existing railway\r\nfrom Andernach, on the Rhine, to Gerolstein, in the Eifel, whence the\r\nBelgian border can be reached either via Jünkerath and Weywertz or\r\nvia Lammersweiler and the Luxemburg station of Trois-Vièrges; (2) the\r\nextension to Daun, also on the Andernach-Gerolstein route, of a short\r\nbranch on the Coblenz-Treves Railway which previously terminated at\r\nWittlich; and (3) several other small lines in the Eifel district,\r\noffering additional facilities for the concentration of troops on the\r\nBelgian frontier.\r\n\r\nSo the Malmédy-Stavelot \"light railway\"--especially in view of this\r\nseries of new German lines all leading thereto--had become a railway\r\nof the greatest strategical importance; and the fourth chapter of the\r\nstory (though one upon which it is not proposed to enter here) would\r\nshow how this network of strategical lines, developed with so much\r\nenergy and thoroughness, was brought into operation in 1914 immediately\r\non the outbreak of war, and, from that time, constituted one of the\r\nmain arteries for the passage of German troops to and from Belgium and\r\nNorthern France.\r\n\r\nIn regard to _Holland_, one finds a new line of railway from Jülich--a\r\nstation reached from Düren, on the main line between Cologne and\r\nAix-la-Chapelle--to Dalheim, the German frontier station on the direct\r\nline from Cologne via Rheydt to Roermond, a Dutch station on the right\r\nbank of the Meuse (which is here crossed by two bridges), and thence\r\nthrough the Belgian stations of Moll and Herenthals and across the flat\r\nexpanse of the Campine to Antwerp.\r\n\r\nThis line obviously offers an alternative route for the transport of\r\ntroops from Cologne and Aix-la-Chapelle to Dalheim; but of still greater\r\nsignificance is the information given by the writer of the _Fortnightly\r\nReview_ articles as to the changes carried out at Dalheim itself,\r\ntransforming that place from \"an unimportant halting-place\" into \"a\r\npoint of concentration of great strategical importance\" on the frontiers\r\nof Holland.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the line from Dalheim to Roermond and on to Antwerp was\r\nalready a double one, the alterations made at Dalheim were confined\r\nto a liberal provision of railway sidings in order that, as we have\r\nseen was done on the Belgian frontier, a large body of troops could\r\nbe concentrated for a possible invasion, in this instance, either of\r\nHolland itself, or of Belgium by the alternative route across the\r\nsouth-eastern corner of Dutch territory.\r\n\r\nOne of the Dalheim sidings, about a quarter of a mile in length,\r\nsituate on a high embankment; and, in order that it could be reached\r\nwithout interfering with other traffic, a bridge over which the main\r\nline runs east of Dalheim station was widened to allow of the laying\r\nacross it of a third pair of rails. Other sidings adjoining Dalheim\r\nstation have no fewer than ten pairs of parallel rails, and there\r\nare still others on the west of the same station, towards the Dutch\r\nfrontier. At Wegberg and Rheydt, east of Dalheim, further sidings were\r\nprovided which, like those at Dalheim, would not possibly be required\r\nfor other than military reasons.\r\n\r\nSumming up the situation in regard alike to the Belgian and the Dutch\r\nfrontiers, Mr. Boulger remarks, in his article of February, 1914:--\r\n\r\n    Thus on an arc extending from Treves to Nijmegen (excluding\r\n    from our purview what is called the main concentration on the\r\n    Saar, behind Metz), the German War Department has arranged for a\r\n    simultaneous advance by fourteen separate routes across Holland,\r\n    Belgium and the Grand Duchy.\r\n\r\nIn view of all these facts, there is no possible room for doubt as to\r\nthe prolonged and extensive nature of the preparations made by Germany\r\nfor the war she instigated in 1914; but the particular consideration\r\nwith which we are here concerned is that of seeing to what extent those\r\npreparations related either to the construction of strategical lines of\r\nrailway or to the adaptation of existing lines to strategical purposes.\r\n\r\nLeaving Belgium and Holland, and looking at the Prussian State lines in\r\n_Schleswig-Holstein_, one finds on the official map the indication of\r\na new line (partly built and partly under construction in 1910) which,\r\nstarting from Holtenau, at the mouth of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in the\r\nBaltic, continues the short distance to Kiel, then turns to the west,\r\nconnects with the Neumünster-Vandrup main line to Denmark, crosses the\r\ncanal, and so on to Husum, a junction on the Altona-Esbjerg west-coast\r\nroute. This new line would evidently be of strategical advantage in\r\nmoving troops from Kiel either for the defence of the Kaiser Wilhelm\r\nCanal or to resist invasion by sea on the north of the waterway. Then\r\nthe existing line from Kiel through Eckernförde to Flensburg, on the\r\nNeumünster-Vandrup route to Denmark, and giving through connection from\r\nKiel to Tondern and Hoyer on the west coast--has been \"nationalised,\"\r\nand so added to the Prussian State system; while from two stations just\r\nto the north of Flensburg there are short new lines which, meeting at\r\nTorsbüll, continue to the Alsener Sund, on the west of the Little Belt,\r\nand may--or may not--be of value in improving Prussia's strategical\r\nposition in this corner of the Baltic, and in immediate proximity to the\r\nDanish island of Fünen.\r\n\r\nFinally a large number of additions have been made in recent years to\r\nthe State Railway systems in the interior of Germany; and, although a\r\ngood proportion of these may have been provided to meet the increased\r\neconomic and social needs of the German people, many of them must\r\nbe regarded as strategical lines designed to facilitate (1) the\r\nmobilisation of troops on the outbreak of war; (2) their concentration,\r\nby routes covering all parts of the Empire, as arranged long in advance;\r\nand (3) their speedy transfer across country from one frontier to\r\nanother, should several campaigns be fought at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe resort by Germany to strategical railways in Africa and elsewhere,\r\nas a means of furthering her Weltpolitik, will be dealt with in the two\r\nchapters that follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[52] \"Gesammelte Schriften.\" Berlin, 1891, etc.\r\n\r\n[53] The articles which here specially come into question are--\"The\r\nMenace of Elsenborn\" (published in the _Fortnightly_, July, 1908); \"An\r\nObject Lesson in German Plans\" (February, 1910); and \"A Further Object\r\nLesson in German Plans\" (February, 1914).\r\n\r\n[54] They were \"hydraulic turntables,\" according to Major\r\nStuart-Stephens. See _The English Review_ for June, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nA GERMAN-AFRICAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nStrategical railways in South-West Africa were built by Germany as\r\na means towards the achievement of her designs on British South\r\nAfrica; but these, in turn, were only part of a still greater plan\r\nhaving for its purpose the transformation of Africa as a whole into a\r\nGerman-African Empire which should compare in value, if not in glory,\r\nwith that of the Indian Empire itself.\r\n\r\nColonisation societies began to be formed in Germany as early as 1849;\r\nthough in the first instance the aims of their promoters were directed\r\nmainly to such parts of the world as Brazil, Texas, the Mosquito Shore,\r\nChili and Morocco. All such places as these, however, offered the\r\ndisadvantage that Germans going there could only become foreign settlers\r\nunder the more or less civilised Powers already in possession.[55]\r\nIn the 60's and 70's of the nineteenth century attention in Germany\r\nbegan to be diverted, rather, to Africa as a land where vast expanses,\r\npossessing great prospects and possibilities, and not yet controlled by\r\nany civilised Power, were still available not only for colonisation but\r\nfor acquisition. So it was that successive German travellers explored\r\nmany different parts of Africa and published accounts of their journeys\r\ndesigned, not merely as contributions to geographical science, but,\r\nalso, to impress a then somewhat apathetic German public with the\r\nimportance of their acquiring a \"footing\" on the African continent.\r\nIn 1873 a German Society for the Exploration of Equatorial Africa was\r\nfounded. This was followed in 1876 by the German African Society, and\r\nsubsequently these two bodies were combined under the name of the Berlin\r\nAfrican Society.\r\n\r\nNot long after this, evidence was forthcoming that something far more\r\nthan the settling of German colonists in Africa and the securing of a\r\n\"footing\" on African soil by Germany was really being kept in view.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 Sir Bartle Frere, at that time Governor of the Cape and High\r\nCommissioner for South Africa, forwarded to Lord Kimberley a translation\r\nof an article which had just been contributed to the _Geographische\r\nNachrichten_ by Ernst von Weber; and, in doing so he informed the\r\nColonial Secretary that the article contained \"a clear and well-argued\r\nstatement in favour of the plan for a German colony in South Africa\r\nwhich was much discussed in German commercial and political circles\r\neven before the Franco-German War, and is said to have been one of the\r\nimmediate motives of the German mission of scientific inquiry which\r\nvisited southern and eastern Africa in 1870-71.\"\r\n\r\nVon Weber's proposals[56] pointed, however, to the creation, not simply\r\nof \"a German colony\" in South Africa, but of a German Empire in Africa.\r\n\"A new Empire,\" he wrote, \"possibly more valuable and more brilliant\r\nthan even the Indian Empire, awaits in the newly-discovered Central\r\nAfrica that Power which shall possess sufficient courage, strength and\r\nintelligence to acquire it\"; and he proceeded to show (1) why Germany\r\nshould be this Power, and (2) the means by which she might eventually\r\nsecure control of the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of trading settlements was to ensure for the Germans\r\na footing in the districts north of the Transvaal, and this was to\r\nbe followed by the flooding of South Africa generally with German\r\nimmigrants. The Boers spread throughout South Africa were already allied\r\nto the Germans by speech and habits, and they would, he thought, be\r\nsure to emigrate to the north and place themselves under the protection\r\nof the German colonies there, rather than remain subject to the hated\r\nBritish. In any case, \"a constant mass-immigration of Germans would\r\ngradually bring about a decided numerical preponderance of Germans over\r\nthe Dutch population, and of itself would effect the Germanisation of\r\nthe country in a peaceful manner. It was,\" he continued, \"this free,\r\nunlimited room for annexation in the north, this open access to the\r\nheart of Africa, which principally inspired me with the idea, now more\r\nthan four years ago, that Germany should try, by the acquisition of\r\nDelagoa Bay and the subsequent continued influx of German immigrants\r\ninto the Transvaal, to secure future dominion over the country, and\r\nso pave the way for the foundation of a German-African Empire of the\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\nThe procedure to be followed was (1) the acquiring of territory in\r\nAfrica by Germany wherever she could get it, whether in the central or\r\nin the coastal districts; (2) co-operation with the Boers as a step\r\ntowards bringing them and their Republics under German suzerainty; and\r\n(3) the overthrow of British influence, with the substitution for it of\r\nGerman supremacy.\r\n\r\nThese ideas gained wide acceptance in Germany; they became a leading\r\nfactor in the colonial policy of the Imperial Government, and they\r\nreconciled the German people, more or less, to the heavy burdens which\r\nthe developments of that policy were to involve.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN SOUTH-WEST AFRICA\r\n\r\nThe first steps towards the attainment of the aspirations entertained\r\nwere taken by Herr Adolf Lüderitz, a Bremen merchant who, acting under\r\nthe auspices of the German Colonial Society, and having received from\r\nthe Imperial Foreign Office assurances of its protection, established\r\na trading settlement, in April, 1883, in the bay of Angra Pequeña,\r\nsituate between Namaqualand and Damaraland on the west coast of Africa,\r\nand about 150 miles north of Orange River, the northern boundary of\r\nCape Colony. Acquiring from a Hottentot chief a stretch of territory\r\n215 miles in extent in the Hinterland of Angra Pequeña, Lüderitz\r\nraised the German flag in the settlement, which thus became Germany's\r\nfirst colony. Further concessions of territory were obtained, and in\r\nSeptember, 1884, Germany announced that the west coast of Africa, from\r\n26 degrees S. latitude to Cape Frio, excepting Walfisch Bay (declared\r\nBritish in 1878), had been placed under the protection of the German\r\nEmperor. A treaty made between England and Germany in 1890 defined the\r\nlimits of the German South-West African Protectorate as bounded on the\r\nsouth by the Orange River and Cape Colony, on the north by Portuguese\r\nAngola, on the west by the Atlantic, and on the east by British\r\nBechuanaland, with the so-called \"Caprivi Strip,\" giving Germany access\r\nfrom the north-east corner of her Protectorate to a point on the Zambezi\r\nRiver north of Victoria Falls.[57] The total area comprised within these\r\nboundaries was about 322,200 square miles.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, the new Protectorate aroused little enthusiasm in Germany\r\nas a colony where her surplus population could hope to settle and\r\nprosper under the German flag instead of going to foreign countries,\r\nas so many thousands of Germans were then doing. On a coast-line of\r\n900 miles there was no good natural harbour except the one at Walfisch\r\nBay, owned by the British. Swakopmund and Lüderitzbucht, on which the\r\nGerman colonists would have to rely, were then little better than open\r\nroadsteads. Considerable expanses of the territory itself consist of\r\ndrought-stricken desert. The rainfall in Damaraland and Namaqualand\r\naverages only about three inches a year. In certain districts a period\r\nof five or six years has been known to pass without any rain at all.\r\nA record of rainfall on some parts of the coast has shown a total of\r\none-fifth of an inch in the course of twelve months. At Walfisch Bay the\r\nBritish settlement imports its fresh water from Capetown. On the higher\r\nof the series of plateaux rising gradually to the Kalahari desert the\r\nclimatic conditions are more favourable, and the better rainfall in the\r\nnorth-east allows of good crops being grown, while various sections are\r\nfavourable for stock-raising. In later years, also, various deposits\r\nof copper were found in the district of Otavi, some 400 miles from\r\nSwakopmund, and diamond fields, which yielded nearly £1,000,000 worth of\r\nstones in the first year, were discovered east of Lüderitzbucht in 1908.\r\nBut in Germany the Protectorate was regarded as a desirable acquisition\r\nmainly, if not exclusively, because of the advantages it was expected to\r\nafford as a base for the eventual creation of a German-African Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HERERO RISING\r\n\r\nThe attainment of this higher purpose seemed likely to be furthered as\r\nthe result of the steps taken to suppress the risings of the Hereros\r\nand the Hottentots between the years 1903 and 1907. Not only did the\r\nreinforcements sent out from Germany assume such proportions that at one\r\ntime the Germans are said to have had no fewer than 19,000 men under\r\narms in the Protectorate, but the troops took with them a plentiful\r\nsupply of pom-poms, mountain guns, field guns and Maxims of various\r\nkinds, the _Revue Militaire des Armées Étrangères_ being led to remark\r\nthereon that \"the German columns had an unusually large proportion of\r\nartillery, roughly two batteries to three companies of mounted infantry;\r\nand it is difficult to believe that so many guns were necessary,\r\nespecially as the Hereros had no artillery at all.[58] Probably,\"\r\nthe _Revue_ continued, \"the artillery could have been dispensed with\r\naltogether; and had this been done, the columns would have been rendered\r\nmore mobile.\"\r\n\r\nThe military measures taken appeared to be in excess of requirements\r\neven when allowance was made for the fact that the campaign was fought\r\nin difficult country and that the Germans themselves lost about 5,000\r\nmen; but the real significance of the policy adopted lay in the keeping\r\nof a considerable proportion of the German expeditionary force in the\r\ncolony after the rising had, with German thoroughness, been effectively\r\ncrushed.\r\n\r\nThis procedure attracted attention and adverse comment even in Germany,\r\nwhere doubts were already being entertained as to whether good value was\r\nbeing received for the £30,000,000 which the suppression of the troubles\r\nhad cost. It was, however, made clear that the still considerable\r\nbody of German troops left in the colony was being kept on hand there\r\nin case of the opportunity arising for its employment in another\r\ndirection--that, namely, of achieving Germany's aspirations in regard\r\nto the conquest of British South Africa, and the final elimination of\r\nBritish influence from Africa in general.\r\n\r\nEvidence both as to the nature of these continued aspirations and as to\r\nthe further purpose it was hoped the troops on the spot might effect was\r\nforthcoming in various directions.\r\n\r\nIn a book of 416 pages, published in 1905, under the title of \"Das\r\nneue Südafrika,\" Dr. Paul Samassa emphasised the part which the German\r\npeople had taken in the settlement of South Africa; pointed to the\r\nclose relationship and affinity of feeling between Germans and Boers;\r\nencouraged the idea of their mutually looking forward to the opening up\r\nof South Africa as \"a land of settlement for the German race,\" and said,\r\nfurther:--\r\n\r\n    German South-West Africa is, to-day, a strong tramp card in\r\n    our hands, from the point of view of Weltpolitik. In England\r\n    much has been said of late as to what a good thing it would\r\n    be for that country if our fleet were annihilated before it\r\n    became dangerous.... On our side we might cool these hot-heads,\r\n    and strengthen the peace party in England, if we reminded them\r\n    that, whatever the loss to ourselves of a war with that country,\r\n    England would run a greater risk--that of losing South Africa.\r\n    We have in German South-West Africa to-day about 12,000 troops,\r\n    of whom one-half will remain there for a considerable time. In\r\n    the event of a war between Germany and England the South African\r\n    coast would naturally be blockaded by England; and there would\r\n    then be nothing left for our troops to do but to go on to Cape\r\n    Colony--for their food supplies.\r\n\r\nIn so doing they could, he argued, count upon the support of the Boers,\r\nof whom there were 14,000 opposed to the English at the end of the\r\nSouth African war. As against this possible concentration of German\r\ntroops and Boers there was the fact that the English garrison in South\r\nAfrica did not exceed 20,000. So, he added, the people in England could\r\nconsider \"what an incalculable adventure a war with Germany might be,\r\nnotwithstanding the superiority of the English fleet.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking in the Reichstag in February, 1906, Herr Ledebour called\r\nattention to the fact that Major von François, who at one time was\r\nin command of German South-West Africa, had declared, in his book,\r\n\"Nama und Damara,\" issued three months previously, that fewer than one\r\nthousand troops would suffice to maintain order in the colony; and Herr\r\nLedebour added:--\"For two years imaginative Pan-German politicians\r\nhave been disseminating the idea that a large force must be maintained\r\nin South-West Africa for the purpose of exercising in the sphere of\r\nWeltpolitik pressure upon England, with the eventual object of invading\r\nCape Colony.\"\r\n\r\nThere is the testimony, also, of \"An Anglo-German,\" who, in the course\r\nof an article on \"German Clerks in British Offices,\" published in _The\r\nLondon Magazine_ for November, 1910, tells the following story:--\r\n\r\n    During a recent stay in Germany I was introduced by a man\r\n    I know to be one of the chief functionaries of the Commerce\r\n    Defence League[59] to a friend of his who had just returned\r\n    from German South-West Africa. On a subsequent meeting I entered\r\n    into conversation with this gentleman, and made inquiries about\r\n    German progress in that part of the world. He answered my\r\n    questions without reserve. Little headway was being made, and\r\n    little was looked for. Men and money were being freely expended,\r\n    without present return. The only good harbour (Walfisch Bay) is\r\n    a British possession, as likewise are all the islands of any\r\n    value which are dotted along the coast.\r\n\r\n    \"Why then,\" was my inevitable query, \"do the Germans persist\r\n    in their occupation of the country?\"\r\n\r\n    He smiled craftily.\r\n\r\n    \"We Germans look far ahead, my friend,\" he replied. \"We\r\n    foresee a British débácle in South Africa, and we are on the\r\n    spot. Thanks to the pioneers of our excellent League, our\r\n    plans are all matured. The League finances the scheme and the\r\n    Imperial Government supplies the military forces. By cession--or\r\n    otherwise--Walfisch Bay will before long be German territory;\r\n    but in the meantime British Free Trade opposes no obstacle to\r\n    us, and we can pursue our purpose unmolested.\"\r\n\r\n    \"But what is that purpose?\" I asked, with the object of\r\n    leading him on.\r\n\r\n    \"Surely you are not so blind as to need enlightenment!\" was\r\n    his reply. \"Germany has long regarded South Africa as a future\r\n    possession of her own. When the inevitable happens, and Great\r\n    Britain finds her hands full elsewhere, we are ready to strike\r\n    the moment the signal is given, and Cape Colony, Bechuanaland,\r\n    Rhodesia--all frontier States--will fall like ripe apples into\r\n    our grasp.\"\r\n\r\nIn order, however, that Germany might be prepared thus to take action\r\nat a moment's notice, two things were essential, in addition to having\r\ntroops on the spot, namely, (1) that the colony should possess railways\r\nwithin striking distance alike of the Cape, of Bechuanaland and of\r\nRhodesia; and (2) that the military preparations as a whole should be so\r\ncomplete as to be ready for any emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAYS IN G.S.W. AFRICA\r\n\r\nRailways were indispensable on account, not only of the considerable\r\ndistances to be covered, but, also, of the sand-belts and stretches of\r\ndesert across which the transport of troops and stores would be a matter\r\nof great difficulty without the help of railways. They were, in fact, a\r\nvital part of the whole scheme.\r\n\r\nFollowing on Germany's annexation of Damaraland and Great Namaqualand,\r\nand her conversion of them into the Protectorate of German South-West\r\nAfrica, a party of German engineers and surveyors landed at Swakopmund\r\nwith the design of planning a line of railway to be constructed from\r\nthat point to Windhoek, and thence across the Kalahari desert to the\r\nTransvaal. About the same time, also, Germans and Boers were alike\r\nworking to secure as much of Bechuanaland as they could, without\r\nattracting too much attention to their proceedings. A realisation\r\nof these further aims might have been of great value to Germany in\r\nfacilitating the attainment of her full programme in respect to\r\nAfrica; but the scheme was frustrated by Great Britain's annexation of\r\nBechuanaland in September, 1885, the result of the step thus taken being\r\nto drive a wedge of British territory between German South-West Africa\r\nand the Boer Republics.\r\n\r\nSo the railway in question got no further east than Windhoek, the\r\ncapital of the colony, a distance inland of 237 miles.\r\n\r\nHaving failed in one direction, Germany tried another. Under a\r\nconcession granted to them in 1887 by the Government of the Transvaal\r\nRepublic, a group of Dutch, German and other capitalists, constituting\r\nthe Netherlands South African Railway Company, built a railway from\r\nDelagoa Bay to Pretoria; and the new aim of Germany was, apparently,\r\nto make use of this line, and so get access to the Transvaal--and\r\nbeyond--from the east coast instead of from the west.\r\n\r\nConfirmation of this fact is to be found in \"A Brief History of the\r\nTransvaal Secret Service System, from its Inception to the Present\r\nTime,\" written by Mr. A. E. Heyer, and published at Cape Town in 1899.\r\nThe writer had held a position in the Transvaal which enabled him to\r\nlearn many interesting facts concerning the working of the system in\r\nquestion. Among other things he tells how, at Lisbon, every effort\r\nwas made to obtain a port in Delagoa Bay, and how, \"aided by Germany,\r\nDr. Leyds approached Lisbon over and over again with a view to get\r\nDelagoa Bay ceded to the Transvaal\"; though the Doctor got no more\r\nfrom the Portuguese authorities than a reminder that, under the London\r\nConvention of 1884, the South African Republic could conclude no treaty\r\nor engagement with any foreign State or nation (except the Orange Free\r\nState) until such treaty or engagement had been submitted to the Queen\r\nof England for her approval.\r\n\r\nThat Germany, in giving her \"aid\" in these matters to the Transvaal\r\nRepublic, was inspired by a regard for the furthering of her own\r\nparticular schemes is beyond all reasonable doubt; but Mr. Heyer shows,\r\nalso, that when the negotiations with Portugal were unsuccessful, there\r\nwas elaborated a scheme under which Germany and the Transvaal were to\r\nget what they wanted by means of a _coup de main_. Mr. Heyer says on\r\nthis subject:--\r\n\r\n    I have before me a copy of a document, dated Pretoria,\r\n    August 24, 1892 (the original of which is still in a certain\r\n    Government office in Pretoria), wherein a Pretoria-Berlin\r\n    scheme is detailed, namely, \"How a few regiments of Prussian\r\n    Infantry could be landed at Delagoa Bay and force their way into\r\n    Transvaal territory, and, 'once in,' defy British suzerainty,\r\n    and for all time 'hang the annoying question of her paramountcy\r\n    on the nail.'\" The name of Herr von Herff, then German Consul\r\n    at Pretoria, appears on the document. Any one reading this\r\n    cleverly-planned \"Descent on Delagoa\" would be readily convinced\r\n    as to how very easily a German raid on Delagoa territory could\r\n    be successfully accomplished.\r\n\r\nThis project, also, proved abortive, and, in default of Delagoa Bay,\r\nGermany had still to regard her South-West African Protectorate, with\r\nits railways and its armed forces, as the base from which British\r\ninterests were to be wiped out--sooner or later--from the Cape to Cairo.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the outbreak of war in 1914, the principal railways in\r\nGerman South-West Africa--apart from some minor lines which do not come\r\ninto consideration--were as follows:--\r\n\r\n    -----------------+---------------+-------------------\r\n                     | 2 ft. GAUGE.  | 3 ft. 6 in. GAUGE.\r\n        RAILWAY.     |    Miles.     |      Miles.\r\n    -----------------+---------------+-------------------\r\n    Northern         |      121      |      119½\r\n    Otavi            |      425      |       --\r\n    Southern         |       --      |      340½\r\n    North-to-South   |       --      |      317\r\n    -----------------+---------------+-------------------\r\n          Total      |      546      |      777\r\n    -----------------+---------------+-------------------\r\n\r\nGranting that the Northern Railway was needed to afford a means of\r\ncommunication between Swakopmund and the capital of the colony, and that\r\nthe original purpose of the Otavi line was to provide an outlet for the\r\ncopper obtained from the mines in that district, it is, nevertheless,\r\nthe fact that the Southern and the North-to-South lines were designed to\r\nserve what were mainly or exclusively strategical purposes.\r\n\r\nWhen the building of the first section of the Southern line--from\r\nLüderitzbucht to Aus--was under consideration in the Reichstag, one\r\nof the members of that body, Herr Lattmann, recommended that the vote\r\nshould be passed without being referred to a committee; and in support\r\nof his recommendation he said:--\r\n\r\n    This way of passing the vote would be of particular\r\n    importance for the whole nation, since the railway would not\r\n    then have to be regarded from the point of view of provisioning\r\n    our troops, or with regard to the financially remunerative\r\n    character of the colony, but because a much more serious\r\n    question lies behind it, namely, what significance has the\r\n    railway in the event of complications between Germany and other\r\n    nations? Yes, this railway can be employed for other purposes\r\n    than for transport from the coast to the interior; our troops\r\n    can be easily conveyed by it from the interior to the coast and\r\n    thence to other places. If, for example, a war had broken out\r\n    with England we could send them into Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nFrom Aus the line was extended in 1908 to Keetmanshoop, a distance\r\ninland of 230 miles from Lüderitzbucht. Situate in the _Bezirk_\r\n(district) of South-West Africa nearest to Cape Province, Keetmanshoop,\r\nwith the railway as a source of supply from the chief harbour of the\r\ncolony, developed into the leading military station of German South-West\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nAt Keetmanshoop all the chief military authorities were stationed. It\r\nbecame the headquarters of the Medical Corps, the Ordnance Department,\r\nthe Engineer and Railway Corps, and the Intelligence Corps of the\r\nSouthern Command. It was the point of mobilisation for all the troops\r\nin that Command. It had a considerable garrison, and it had, also, an\r\narsenal which a correspondent of the _Transvaal Chronicle_, who visited\r\nthe town about two years before the outbreak of war in 1914 and gathered\r\nmuch information concerning the military preparations which had then\r\nalready been made,[60] described as four times as large, and, in regard\r\nto its contents, four times as important, as the arsenal at Windhoek.\r\nThose contents included--47 gun carriages; fourteen 16-pounders;\r\neighteen ambulances; 82 covered convoy vehicles; 3,287 wheels, mostly\r\nfor trek ox-wagons; three large transportable marquees used as magazines\r\nand containing 28,000 military rifles; huge quantities of bandoliers,\r\nkits, etc.; three further magazines for ammunition, and large stores\r\nof fodder; while further military supplies were constantly arriving\r\nby train from Lüderitzbucht, whither they were brought from Germany\r\nby German ships. In the arsenal workshops was a staff of men actively\r\nengaged on the making of, among other military requirements, 1,000\r\nsaddles and water bags for the Camel Corps kept available for crossing\r\nthe desert between the furthest limit of the railway and the Cape\r\nProvince border.\r\n\r\nIt was, also, in this south-eastern district, and in immediate\r\nproximity, therefore, to Cape Province and Bechuanaland, that the\r\nmilitary forces kept in the colony had all their principal manoeuvres.\r\n\r\nOf still greater importance, from a strategical standpoint, was the\r\nbranch of this Southern Railway which, starting from Seeheim, forty\r\nmiles west of Keetmanshoop, continued in a south-easterly direction\r\nto Kalkfontein, eighty miles north of Raman's Drift, on the Orange\r\nRiver, and less than ninety miles from Ukamas, where the Germans had\r\nestablished a military post within five miles of Nakob, situate on the\r\nBechuanaland border, only forty miles from Upington, in Cape Province.\r\nFrom Kalkfontein the branch was to be continued another thirty miles to\r\nWarmbad, and so on to Raman's Drift--a convenient point for the passage\r\nof the Orange River into Cape Province territory by an attacking force.\r\nAt Seeheim, the junction of this branch line, a Service Corps was\r\nstationed; Kalkfontein was the headquarters of the Camel Corps of 500\r\nmen and animals; and at Warmbad there was a military post and a military\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nThe North-to-South line allowed of an easy movement of troops between\r\nthe military headquarters at Keetmanshoop and Windhoek, or vice versâ.\r\nAccording to the original estimates this line was not to be completed\r\nbefore 1913. Special reasons for urgency--as to the nature of which it\r\nwould be easy to speculate--led, however, to the line being opened for\r\ntraffic on March 8, 1912. From Windhoek, also, troops were supplied to\r\nGobabis, situate 100 miles east of the capital and about forty miles\r\nwest of the Bechuanaland frontier. Gobabis became a German military\r\nstation in 1895. Provided with a well-equipped fort, it became the chief\r\nstrategical position on the eastern border of German South-West Africa.\r\nA railway connecting Gobabis with Windhoek was to have been commenced in\r\n1915.\r\n\r\nFrom Windhoek, as already told, there is rail communication with\r\nSwakopmund.\r\n\r\nGrootfontein, the terminus, on the east, of the Swakopmund-Otavi line,\r\nhad been a military station since 1899. Its special significance lay\r\nin the fact that it was the nearest point of approach by rail to the\r\n\"Caprivi Strip,\" along which the German troops, conveyed as far as\r\nGrootfontein by rail, were to make their invasion of the adjoining\r\nBritish territory of Rhodesia. Troop movements in this direction would\r\nhave been further facilitated by a link at Karibib connecting the\r\nSwakopmund-Otavi-Grootfontein line with the one to Windhoek and thence\r\nto the military headquarters at Keetmanshoop. Karibib was itself a\r\nmilitary base, in addition to having large railway offices and workshops.\r\n\r\nWith, therefore, the minor exceptions, the system of railways in German\r\nSouth-West Africa had been designed or developed in accordance with\r\nplans which had for their basis an eventual attack on British territory\r\nin three separate directions--(1) Cape Province, (2) Bechuanaland and\r\n(3) Rhodesia. The Southern and the North-to-South lines had, also, been\r\nbuilt exclusively with the standard Cape gauge of 3 ft. 6 in., so that,\r\nwhen \"der Tag\" arrived, and German succeeded British supremacy in South\r\nAfrica, these particular lines could be continued in order to link up\r\nwith those which the Germans would then expect to take over from Cape\r\nProvince. Keetmanshoop was eventually to be converted from a terminus to\r\na stopping-place on a through line of German railway from Lüderitzbucht\r\nto Kimberley, the effect of which, it was pointed out, would be to\r\nshorten the distance from Europe to Bulawayo by 1,300 miles as compared\r\nwith the journey via the Cape. Surveys had been made for extensions (1)\r\nfrom Keetmanshoop, via Hasuur, to the Union frontier near Rietfontein,\r\nand (2) from Kalkfontein, on the southern branch, to Ukamas, also on the\r\nfrontier and in the direction of Upington, in Union territory. Each of\r\nthese additions would have carried the original scheme a stage further,\r\nthough it was not, apparently, thought wise to make them before \"der\r\nTag\" actually arrived.\r\n\r\nOn these various railways the Government of German South-West Africa\r\nhad expended, so far as the available figures show, a total of,\r\napproximately, £8,400,000, defrayed in part from Imperial funds and\r\nin part from the revenue of the Protectorate. This total includes the\r\namount paid by the Government to the South-West Africa Company for\r\ntheir line from Swakopmund to the Company's mines at Otavi and Tsumeb,\r\nbut it does not include the cost of the original narrow-gauge Government\r\nline from Swakopmund to Windhoek, of which the section between\r\nSwakopmund and Karibib was abandoned when the Swakopmund-Otavi line, via\r\nKaribib, was taken over, the remaining section from Karibib to Windhoek\r\nbeing then converted into the Cape 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. On most of the\r\nopen lines no more than two or three trains a week were run, and on some\r\nof the branches there was only one train in the week.[61]\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY PREPARATIONS\r\n\r\nFurther details as to the elaborate nature of the preparations made for\r\nthe realisation of Germany's dreams of conquest in Africa are supplied\r\nby Mr. J. K. O'Connor in a pamphlet published at Capetown, towards the\r\nend of 1914, under the title of \"The Hun in our Hinterland; or the\r\nMenace of G.S.W.A.\" Mr. O'Connor made a tour through German South-West\r\nAfrica a few months before the outbreak of the war, assuming the rôle\r\nof a journalist in search of data concerning the agricultural resources\r\nof the territory. He obtained much information which had other than an\r\nagricultural interest.\r\n\r\nHe ascertained, for instance, that the German troops then in the\r\nterritory consisted of Mounted Infantry, Field Artillery, Machine Gun\r\nDivisions, Intelligence Divisions, an Engineer and Railway Corps, Field\r\nRailway Divisions, an Etappen-Formation, a Camel Corps, a Police Force\r\nand a Reserve, representing altogether--apart from natives--a trained\r\nEuropean force of approximately 10,000 men, whose duties and location in\r\nthe event of war had all been assigned to them in advance.\r\n\r\nHe found that the railways had been supplemented by a strong transport\r\nservice of natives, who had an abundant supply of oxen and mules for\r\ntheir wagons.\r\n\r\nHe tells how (in addition to the military stations already mentioned)\r\nthe Germans had established throughout the territory a network of\r\nblock-houses, strengthened by forts at intervals and supplemented by\r\nmagazines and storehouses at central points; while 1,600 miles of\r\ntelegraph and telephone wires, together with the \"Funken-telegraph,\"\r\nplaced all these stations and outposts in touch with one another as well\r\nas with the military headquarters and the various towns.[62]\r\n\r\nHe says concerning Keetmanshoop that its conversion into the chief\r\nmilitary station in the territory was \"the first move in the German\r\ngame.\"\r\n\r\nHe points to the fact that \"Das Koloniale Jahrbuch,\" published by\r\nauthority, laid it down that the Boers in British South Africa must be\r\nconstantly reminded of their Low-German origin; that German ideas must\r\nbe spread among them by means of German schools and German churches, and\r\nhe declares:--\"For thirty years Teuton ideas have been foisted upon the\r\nBoer population of British South Africa. For thirty years, under the\r\nguise of friendship, Germany has plotted and planned for the elimination\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon element from South Africa.\"\r\n\r\nMr. O'Connor further writes:--\r\n\r\n    From what I was able to gather it was evident that the\r\n    military plans of the Germans were completed for an invasion of\r\n    the Union territory, and that they were only awaiting the day\r\n    when Peace would spread her wings and soar from the embassies of\r\n    Europe. It was not anticipated, however, that that would be in\r\n    August, 1914.\r\n\r\n    They were confident of success, and from the conversations\r\n    that took place between officers and myself it was evident that\r\n    the possession of the African continent was the greatest desire\r\n    of the Teutons.\r\n\r\n    The smashing up of France and Great Britain were only\r\n    incidents that would lead to the whole continent of Africa\r\n    becoming a German possession; and it was considered that as\r\n    Germany would accomplish this, despite her late entrance upon\r\n    the stage as a Colonial Power, she would have more to show for\r\n    her thirty years as such a Power than could either England or\r\n    France, who had started colonising centuries before her.\r\n\r\n    The great aim became to break France and England, for the\r\n    purpose of acquiring their African possessions; and, having\r\n    broken these Powers, Germany would have turned her attention to\r\n    the African possessions of smaller Powers who, having neither\r\n    England nor France to rely upon, would have been compelled to\r\n    relinquish their possessions, and, by so doing, would have made\r\n    Germany the supreme Power in Africa.\r\n\r\nSumming up the conclusions at which he arrived, as the result of all\r\nthat he saw for himself and all that he had heard from responsible\r\nGerman officers during the course of his tour, Mr. O'Connor says:--\r\n\r\n    From the day the Germans set their feet upon South-West\r\n    African soil they have prepared themselves for a raid into\r\n    British territory. For years the Reichstag has voted two million\r\n    pounds per annum for the purpose. Had these millions been spent\r\n    on the development of South-West Africa it would, to-day, be a\r\n    colony of which any country might be proud. But what can they\r\n    show for this expenditure? Nothing but a military camp.\r\n\r\n    It is evident, then, that this territory has not been\r\n    regarded by the Berliners as a colony, but as a jumping-off\r\n    ground for an invasion of British South Africa.\r\n\r\nHere we have simply an amplification of ideas which, as we have seen,\r\nhad long been entertained in Germany; though they were ideas it was now\r\nbeing sought to reduce to practice by a resort, in advance, to every\r\nstep that could possibly be taken for ensuring their realisation. Any\r\nsuggestion that the system of strategical railways which had been built,\r\nand the elaborate military preparations which had been effected, were\r\nmerely precautions against a further possible rising of the natives\r\nwould have been absurd.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAIL CONNECTION WITH ANGOLA\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. O'Connor says in regard to Germany's attitude towards the\r\nAfrican possessions of the smaller Powers gives additional significance\r\nto a report published in the _Leipziger Neueste Nachrichten_ of May 31,\r\n1914, concerning a project for building a line of railway along the\r\ncoast of German South-West Africa to connect with Portuguese Angola.\r\nThis was to be the first of a series of lines which \"after lengthy\r\ndiscussions with the Imperial Government,\" were to be carried out in\r\nGerman South-West Africa by a syndicate of prominent shipping and\r\nbanking houses in Germany, controlling an initial capital of 50,000,000\r\nmarks (£2,500,000). It was further reported that in the early part of\r\n1914 the Governor of German South-West Africa made a tour through the\r\nnorthern part of the Protectorate, going as far as Tiger Bay, in Angola,\r\n\"in connection with possible railway construction in the near future.\"\r\n\r\nAngola was certainly an item on the German list of desirable\r\nacquisitions in Africa. It has been in the occupation of Portugal since\r\nthe middle of the fifteenth century; but the point of view from which it\r\nwas regarded by advocates of German expansion may be judged from some\r\nremarks made in the _Kölnische Zeitung_ by a traveller who returned to\r\nGermany from Angola in June, 1914:--\r\n\r\n    The game is worth the candle. An enormous market for\r\n    industrial products, rich and virgin mineral treasures, a\r\n    fruitful and healthy country equally suitable for agriculture,\r\n    cattle-breeding and immigration, and the finest harbours on the\r\n    west coast--that is the prize that awaits us.\r\n\r\nA territory offering these advantages, having an area estimated at\r\n484,000 square miles, and extending inland for a distance of 1,500\r\nmiles, might be coveted for its own sake; but its possession would\r\nhave been of still greater value to Germany (1) as a continuation,\r\nnorthwards, of German South-West Africa, and (2) as the starting point\r\nfor a chain of communications, under German control, extending right\r\nacross the African continent, from west to east.\r\n\r\nThe coast-railway spoken of by the _Leipziger Neueste Nachrichten_ was\r\nto link up German South-West Africa with Angola, in which country,\r\nalso, the Germans hoped to obtain extensive mining and agricultural\r\nconcessions, thus forwarding their established policy of peaceful\r\npenetration by means of commerce and railways, and establishing economic\r\ninterests which might be expected to lead to political developments in\r\ndue course, and so prepare the way for an eventual seizure of \"the prize\r\nthat awaits us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Germans had also sought to finance the completion eastwards of the\r\nLobito Bay or Benguela Railway, to which reference will be made later\r\non in connection with the development of the Katanga district of the\r\nBelgian Congo; but the condition they advanced, namely that the control\r\nof the line should be left in their hands, coupled with their adoption\r\nof suspicious lines of policy in other directions,[63] led to their\r\nrailway proposals being declined by the Portuguese, with thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN EAST AFRICA\r\n\r\nThen, in order to understand the full scope of the aspirations Germany\r\nwas cherishing towards the African Continent, one must take into account\r\nher railways on the east coast no less than those on the west coast,\r\nsince these, also, formed an essential part of the general scheme.\r\n\r\nThe line which stretches right across German East Africa, from\r\nDar-es-Salaam, the capital of the Protectorate, to Kigoma, on Lake\r\nTanganyika, and north of Ujiji, has a total length of 1,439 miles;\r\nand if the economic development of a territory estimated as having a\r\ntotal area of 384,000 square miles had been the sole aim in view, the\r\nTanganyikabahn would have well deserved to rank as a notable enterprise\r\nin German colonial expansion, and one calling for commendation rather\r\nthan criticism. The question arises, however, whether, in addition to\r\nthe development of German East Africa itself, the railway in question\r\nwas not intended, also, to facilitate the realisation of Germany's\r\ndesigns against Central Africa as part of her aforesaid scheme for the\r\neventual conquest of the African continent.\r\n\r\nThe feverish haste with which the second and third sections of the\r\nrailway were built sufficed, in itself, to give rise to suspicions of\r\nulterior designs. The first section, from Dar-es-Salaam to Morogo (136½\r\nmiles), was constructed by a syndicate of German bankers acting under a\r\nState guarantee of interest, and the work, begun in February, 1905, was\r\ncompleted in September, 1907. The second section, from Morogo to Tabora\r\n(526½ miles), was to have been completed by July 1, 1914; but in 1910,\r\nthe Reichstag voted a special credit both for the earlier completion of\r\nthis second section--which was thus finished by February 26, 1912--and\r\nfor surveys for the third section, from Tabora to Kigoma (776 miles).\r\nSuch, again, was the celerity with which the work on this third section\r\nwas pushed forward that, although the date fixed for the completion of\r\nthe line was April 1, 1915, through rail communication from the Indian\r\nOcean to Lake Tanganyika was established by February 1, 1914--that is to\r\nsay, one year and two months in advance of time.\r\n\r\nWe here come to the two-fold question (1) Why was the railway extended\r\nat all for the 776 miles from Tabora to Lake Tanganyika, considering\r\nthat this portion of the German Protectorate offered, in itself, the\r\nprospect of no traffic at all for the line[64]; and (2) why was it\r\nnecessary that such haste should be shown in the completion of the\r\nundertaking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE OTHER SIDE OF TANGANYIKA\"\r\n\r\nTo the first of these questions the reply is (1) that the traffic on\r\nwhich the western section of the Tanganyikabahn was mainly to rely for\r\nits receipts was traffic originating in or destined for the Belgian\r\nCongo; (2) that the control it was hoped to secure over Belgian trade\r\nwas, in combination with the strategical advantages offered by the\r\nrailway, to be the preliminary to an eventual annexation by Germany of\r\nthe Belgian Congo itself; and (3) that like conditions were to lead, if\r\npossible, to the final realisation of von Weber's dream of 1880.\r\n\r\n\"That we are directing our gaze to the other side of Tanganyika,\" said\r\nthe _Kolonial Zeitung_ of April 4, 1914, in referring to the completion\r\nof the railway to Kigoma--an event which occasioned a great outburst of\r\nenthusiasm in Germany--\"goes, of course, without saying.\"\r\n\r\nThere certainly is much on \"the other side of Tanganyika\" to which\r\nGermany might look with feelings of envy. In regard to mineral wealth,\r\nalone, the resources of the South-eastern section of the Belgian Congo\r\ncould not fail to make a strong appeal to her.\r\n\r\nThe great copper belt in the Katanga district,[65] commences about 100\r\nmiles north-west of the British South African post, Ndola (situate\r\ntwelve miles south of the Congo border), and extends thence, in a\r\nnorth-westerly direction, for a distance of 180 miles, with an average\r\nbreadth of twenty-five miles. \"In the not far distant future, when the\r\nmany problems of development are solved, the Katanga copper belt,\"\r\nsays Mr. J. B. Thornhill,[66] \"will be one of the controlling factors\r\nin the copper supply of the world.\" In the report of the British South\r\nAfrica Company for the year ending March 31, 1914, it was stated that\r\nthe copper-mining industry in Katanga had attained to considerable\r\ndimensions; that furnaces with a capacity of 1,000 tons of copper per\r\nmonth were at work, and that further large additions to the plant were\r\nbeing made.\r\n\r\nKatanga has, also, a tin belt, and coal, gold, iron and other minerals\r\nare found there, besides.\r\n\r\nIn the German territory on the eastern side of Lake Tanganyika there\r\nare, indeed, minerals; but they are found in no such abundance as in the\r\nBelgian territory on the western side of the lake. German East Africa\r\ncan, however, produce in great abundance the wheat, the rice and the\r\nother food supplies necessary for the workers in Katanga mines, and\r\nthe German view has been that the eastern and the western sides of the\r\nlake should be regarded as complementary the one to the other, and that\r\nthe Tanganyikabahn should convey these food supplies to the lake, for\r\ntransfer to the other side by steamer, and bring back the products of\r\nthe mines for distribution, via the German east coast route and the\r\nIndian Ocean, among the markets of the world. In the same way it was\r\nhoped that all goods and necessaries likely to be imported into the\r\nKatanga and Mweru districts from Europe would reach their destination\r\nvia this German East Africa Central Railway; and German business houses\r\nwere strongly advised to establish branches in those districts,[67] so\r\nthat, apparently, Germany would eventually control the trade as well as\r\nthe transport of \"the other side of Tanganyika.\"\r\n\r\nThe development of the south-western section of Germany's east-coast\r\nProtectorate had, in itself, become a matter of vital importance (\"eine\r\nLebensfrage\"[68]); but the Belgian Congo was the only quarter to which\r\nthat section could look for markets for its produce. The possibility\r\nof securing sufficient traffic for the Central Railway to ensure its\r\nfinancial success may have been a secondary consideration; but the\r\nrailway itself was to serve a most important purpose, economically, by\r\nhelping Germany to capture the Tanganyika and trans-Tanganyika trade,\r\nand by making her East Africa colony more prosperous; politically, by\r\nstrengthening her hold on the Belgian Congo through the increase of her\r\ncommercial interests there; and strategically, by affording her the\r\nmeans of effecting a speedy concentration of troops in Central Africa,\r\nshould the occasion for so doing arise.\r\n\r\nThis last-mentioned purpose was to be further attained by the projected\r\nconstruction of what would have been a purely strategical line from\r\nTabora, on the Tanganyikabahn, to Mwanza, on the southern shores of the\r\nVictoria Nyanza, whence German troops would--in case of need--be in a\r\nposition to make a rear attack on British East Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL AFRICA\r\n\r\nGermany's hopes of thus strengthening her position in Central Africa\r\nby means of the Tanganyikabahn received, however, a serious set-back\r\nthrough the activity and enterprise of Belgian and British interests in\r\nproviding, opening up or projecting alternative transport routes which\r\nthreatened (1) to divert a large proportion of the traffic she had\r\nexpected to secure for the East Africa Central line; (2) to diminish\r\ngreatly the prospect of her achieving the commercial and political aims\r\nshe cherished in regard to the Belgian Congo; (3) to make it still\r\nmore difficult for German East Africa to emerge from a position of\r\ncomparative isolation, and (4) to impede greatly the realisation of\r\nGermany's aspirations in regard alike to Central Africa and the African\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nIt is the more necessary that the bearing of all these facts on the\r\ngeneral situation should be understood because they tend to indicate\r\nthe critical nature of the position into which the said aspirations had\r\ndrifted, and the imperative necessity by which Germany may, by 1914,\r\nhave considered she was faced for adopting some bold course of action if\r\nshe were still to look forward to the possibility of those aspirations\r\nbeing realised.\r\n\r\nThe principle originally adopted by King Leopold in his efforts to\r\ndevelop the Congo State was that of supplementing navigation on the\r\nCongo by railways wherever these were necessary either to overcome the\r\ndifficulties presented by rapids or to supply missing links in the chain\r\nof communication to or from the west coast. The same policy was followed\r\nby the Belgian Government when they assumed control, and the last of\r\nthese links--the line, 165 miles long, from Kabalo to Albertville,\r\nconnecting the Congo with the Tanganyika--was opened in March, 1915.\r\nOne reason, in fact, given in Germany for the express speed at which\r\nthe Tanganyikabahn was completed to Kigoma was an alleged fear that\r\nthe Belgians might capture the trade and transport of the territory in\r\nquestion by getting to the lake first.\r\n\r\nThis combined river and rail transport still left it necessary for\r\ntraffic from the Congo basin to the west coast to follow the winding\r\ncourse of that river, with a number of transhipments; and if the route\r\nin question had been the only competitor of the Tanganyikabahn, Germany\r\nwould have had less cause for uneasiness. Meanwhile, however, the\r\nCompagnie du Chemin de Fer du Bas-Congo had built a line--forming a\r\ncontinuation of the Rhodesian Railways--from the boundary of Northern\r\nRhodesia, at Elizabethville, to Kambove (Katanga); and a continuation of\r\nthis line to Bukama, on the Lualaba, a navigable tributary of the Congo,\r\nwas (1) to give shorter and better access to the Congo for products\r\nfrom Katanga, and (2) to establish combined rail and water transport\r\nbetween the entire railway system of South Africa and the mouth of the\r\nCongo. Already the minerals from Katanga were finding their outlet to\r\nthe sea on the east coast via the Rhodesian Railways and the Portuguese\r\nport of Beira, instead of via the Tanganyikabahn and the German port of\r\nDar-es-Salaam. The former had, indeed, become the recognised route for\r\nthis important traffic in preference to the latter. The line between\r\nKambove and Bukama had not been completed when war broke out in 1914;\r\nbut the provision of this through route, and the various facilities\r\nit would offer, rendered still more uncertain the prospect of Germany\r\ngetting control of the trans-Tanganyika traffic for her own lines.\r\n\r\nThere were other important railway schemes, besides.\r\n\r\nFrom Bukama rail communication is to be continued right across Central\r\nAfrica to Matadi, to which point the Congo is navigable for large\r\nvessels from its mouth, less than a hundred miles distant. This line,\r\nin addition to avoiding the great bend of the Congo, will open up and\r\ndevelop the vast and promising territory in the northern districts of\r\nthe Belgian Congo, south of that river.\r\n\r\nAnother scheme which is to be carried out is a line from Kambove, in the\r\nSouthern Katanga, to the south-western boundary of the Belgian Congo,\r\nand thence across Portuguese territory to the present eastern terminus\r\nof the Lobito Bay Railway. This will give to the mining interests of\r\nKatanga direct rail communication, by the shortest possible route, with\r\na port on the west coast, while the connection at Kambove with the\r\nRhodesian and South African systems will make the line a still more\r\nimportant addition to the railways of Africa for the purposes alike of\r\ndevelopment in the central districts and as a shorter route to and from\r\nEurope. German financiers were at one time desirous of undertaking the\r\nextension eastward of the Lobito Bay Railway--mainly, as it seemed, with\r\na view to furthering German interests in Portuguese territory (see page\r\n314); but the Kambove-Lobito Bay line is now to be constructed with\r\nBritish capital.\r\n\r\nFinally there is the Cape-to-Cairo Railway which, passing through the\r\nKatanga mining districts, is likely to divert still more of the traffic\r\nGermany had counted upon alike for her Tanganyikabahn and as a means\r\ntowards the attainment of her political aspirations in Central Africa.\r\n\r\nWhilst these various developments were proceeding, there were still\r\nothers, in the Cameroons, to which attention may now be directed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMEROONS, LAKE CHAD AND THE SUDAN\r\n\r\nAnticipations of the great results for Germany which would follow from\r\nthe building of railways in the Cameroons began to be entertained about\r\nthe year 1897. The main objective of the schemes brought forward seems\r\nto have been, however, not simply the internal economic development of\r\nan already vast area, but the carrying of lines of communication to the\r\nfurthest limits of that area in order, apparently, to extend German\r\ninterests and influence to territories beyond.\r\n\r\nOne of these schemes was for the building of a line of railway from\r\nDuala, the chief port of the Cameroons, to Lake Chad (otherwise Tsâd), a\r\nsheet of water some 7,000 square miles in extent which, situate on the\r\nwestern borders of the Sudan, constitutes the extreme northern limits\r\nof German territory in this direction, while the shores of the lake are\r\noccupied jointly by Germany, England and France.\r\n\r\nThe proposed line was to have an estimated total length of about 1,000\r\nkilometres (621 miles). In September, 1902, the German Imperial\r\nGovernment granted to a Kamerun-Eisenbahn-Syndikat a concession for\r\nbuilding the line; an expedition sent out by the syndicate made a survey\r\nof the route in 1902-3; and a Kamerun-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, with a\r\ncapital of 17,000,000 marks (£850,000), was formed by a group of bankers\r\nand others in Germany to build the first section.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1903, the German Emperor, at his reception of the President\r\nof the Reichstag, gave his blessing to all such enterprises by declaring\r\nthat an essential condition (\"eine Lebensbedingung\") for the welfare of\r\nGermany's colonies in Africa was that the building of railways should\r\nbe taken earnestly in hand. In 1905 the prospects of the proposed line\r\nseemed so hopeful that the early commencement of construction was\r\nannounced as probable; but various difficulties arose, including much\r\ntrouble in regard to labour, and the line did not get beyond the end of\r\nits first stage, a distance of only 160 km. (100 miles) from the coast.\r\n\r\nAlthough the scheme was thus not fully carried out, there was no doubt\r\nas to the nature of the purposes it had been designed to serve. In his\r\nofficial and detailed account of the proposed undertaking[69]--a book\r\nof exceptional merit from the point of view of the clearness and of the\r\nexhaustive data with which \"the case for the line\" is presented--the\r\ndirector of the syndicate says:--\r\n\r\n    My opinion is that only a great railway--one that unites\r\n    the Sudan with the Atlantic, and that extends from Lake Chad to\r\n    the west coast of Africa--will be in a position both to develop\r\n    fully the economic interests of the Cameroons and to assure to\r\n    Germany a means of access to the richest territory that Central\r\n    Africa possesses.\r\n\r\nHad the line been completed as far as Lake Chad, it would have been a\r\npowerful competitor of British railways via the Nile or the Red Sea for\r\nthe traffic of the Sudan, with its vast commercial possibilities; and,\r\nhad it been found the better route, it might have established German\r\ncommercial supremacy in this part of Central Africa, with the inevitable\r\npolitical developments to follow. \"The German Tsâdsee-Eisenbahn,\" the\r\ndirector of the syndicate further wrote, \"will, especially when it has\r\nbeen completed, be for the whole of Central Africa a _Kulturwerk_ of the\r\nfirst importance.\"\r\n\r\nThe Germanisation of Lake Chad, combined with an eventual acquiring\r\nby Germany of French interests in the Sahara and North Africa, would\r\nfurther have permitted the continuation of the Tsâdsee-Eisenbahn from\r\nthat lake to Algeria along the route already projected in France for a\r\nTrans-African line linking up the Mediterranean alike with the Congo\r\nand with the Rhodesian and other British railways in South Africa, via\r\nLake Chad--a line which, it is said, would offer no great technical\r\ndifficulty in construction.[70]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMEROONS AND THE CONGO\r\n\r\nAnother ambitious scheme was for the building of a Mittellandbahn which,\r\ncrossing the Njong, would eventually link up the chief port of the\r\nCameroons with a navigable tributary of the Congo. Here, again, the line\r\nas actually constructed has not been carried a greater distance than\r\nabout 300 km. (186 miles). At one time, in fact, the original project\r\nseemed to have been abandoned; but quite recently it has been brought\r\nforward again under conditions which have a distinct bearing on what has\r\nalready been said concerning Germany and Central Africa.\r\n\r\nFrom the views expressed by Emil Zimmermann in his \"Neu-Kamerun,\"[71]\r\none gathers that in 1913 Germany was regarding with some degree of\r\nconcern alike the outlook for her Tanganyikabahn, on which over\r\n£7,000,000 had been spent, and the prospective set-back to her\r\naspirations in regard to the Belgian Congo; and Herr Zimmermann, in\r\ngiving an account of the additions made to her Cameroons possessions\r\nat the expense of France, under the agreement of November 4, 1911,\r\nfollowing on the Agadir crisis, makes certain overtures to Belgium,\r\nand follows them up with a distinct threat, should she refrain from\r\nresponding to them.\r\n\r\nBelgium and Germany, he says, in effect, are the two dominant Powers\r\nin Central Africa; and he is of opinion that it will be to their mutual\r\ninterest to co-operate in the development of that great territory.\r\nBelgium, however, he finds to be faced by the need for a great outlay\r\nof money (1) on account of necessary improvements of her Congo rail and\r\nriver communication, to meet expanding traffic requirements, and (2) in\r\norder to develop her Katanga territory. She cannot herself command the\r\nnecessary capital, but Germany could assist her to raise it, and would\r\ndo so--provided Belgium undertook that traffic from her Tanganyika and\r\nMweru districts, and, also, from points east of the Middle Congo, should\r\nreach the sea by \"its natural outlet,\" that is to say, by the German\r\nEast African Central Railway.\r\n\r\nShould Belgium refuse to agree to these proposals, and should she, by\r\nher high tariffs, continue to impede the flow of traffic to German\r\nterritory, then it would be open to Germany to construct lines of\r\nrailway from the west coast either to navigable tributaries of the Congo\r\nor to the Congo itself, and so divert the traffic from the Belgian\r\nCongo at certain important points, to the serious prejudice of Belgian\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nApart from what might be done in the way of extending the Duala-Njong\r\nline to the said navigable tributaries of the Congo, as originally\r\nprojected, Herr Zimmermann says that, under the treaty of November 4,\r\n1911, Germany has the right to continue her Cameroons railways across\r\nFrench territory (France having reciprocal rights as regards German\r\nterritory); and he points out how she could exercise this power, to the\r\ndetriment of Belgium, should that country not accept her proposals in\r\nregard to the Congo basin and Central Africa. He specially mentions the\r\nfact that when the boundaries of the 100,000 square miles of territory\r\nadded, at the expense of France, to the German Cameroons (then already\r\n191,000 square miles in extent), were fixed by virtue of the treaty of\r\n1911, the wedge-like strip on the south of Spanish Muni was so defined\r\nas to leave at the eastern point thereof a gap between the Spanish\r\nterritory and the French Cameroons wide enough for either a road or a\r\nrailway; and he emphasises the fact that, by taking advantage of the\r\nfacilities thus open to her, Germany could, under the treaty of 1911,\r\nconstruct a railway 1,000 km. (621 miles) long from Muni Bay through\r\nthe said gap and cross French territory to the junction of the Sangha\r\nwith the Congo. Alternatively, and by arrangement with France, the\r\nline could start from Libreville. \"What such a railway, tapping the\r\nCongo-Sangha-Ubangi traffic at its most favourable point, would mean,\r\ncan,\" Herr Zimmermann remarks, \"be left to the Belgians themselves to\r\nsay.\"\r\n\r\nHe does not suggest that such schemes as these would in themselves be\r\nof great value to Germany; but he thinks they might have a powerful\r\ninfluence, both politically and economically, on the solution of the\r\nTanganyika problem in Germany's favour. In fact, he considers that since\r\nthe 1911 treaty Germany has practically controlled the situation in\r\nCentral Africa; and from all he says it is a reasonable assumption that\r\nthe Agadir crisis, the concession of territory exacted from France, and\r\nthe undertaking as to the carrying of German Cameroon railways across\r\nFrench territory, had far more to do with German designs on the Belgian\r\nCongo and Central Africa than is generally supposed.\r\n\r\nIn another work, published a year later,[72] the same writer, adopting\r\nnow a distinctly different tone, endeavoured to appease an \"Anti-Central\r\nAfrica agitation\" which, he tells us, had developed in Germany and\r\nwas protesting alike against the \"danger\" of acquiring any more\r\n\"Congo-swamps\" and against the \"boundless German plans\" in Africa.\r\nHe further sought to soothe the suspicions which, he found, had been\r\nexcited in Belgium and elsewhere as to the nature of Germany's plans in\r\nAfrica. Germany, he declared, had no annexation projects in view. Her\r\naspirations were purely economic. Kamerun, thanks to the German-French\r\ntreaty of 1911 (which, he reiterated, had changed the whole situation),\r\ncould now take a considerable share in the development of Central\r\nAfrica, and was the more entitled so to do since she had, in Duala, \"one\r\nof the best harbours on the west coast of Africa.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL ADMISSIONS\r\n\r\nAs against, however, affirmations such as these, there is the\r\nundisputable evidence of no less an authority than the German Foreign\r\nMinister himself as to the real nature of Germany's designs on the\r\nBelgian Congo.\r\n\r\nIn the second Belgian Grey Book, published in August, 1915, under the\r\ntitle of \"Correspondance Diplomatique relative à la Guerre de 1914-15,\"\r\nthere is given (pp. 2-3) a letter from the Belgian Minister in Berlin,\r\nBaron Beyens, to his Government, recording, under date April 2, 1914,\r\na conversation which the French Ambassador in Berlin informed him he\r\nhad had quite recently (and, therefore, only about four months before\r\nthe outbreak of war) with the German Foreign Minister. Herr von Jagow\r\nsuggested to him that Germany, France and England should arrive at an\r\nagreement on the construction and linking up of railways in Africa. M.\r\nGambon replied that in this case Belgium ought to be invited to confer\r\nwith them, as she was constructing some new railways on the Congo. He\r\nalso expressed the view that any conference held on the subject should\r\nmeet at Brussels. To this Herr von Jagow responded, \"Oh no; for it is\r\nat the expense of Belgium that our agreement should be made. Do you\r\nnot think,\" he added, \"that King Leopold placed too heavy a burden on\r\nthe shoulders of Belgium? Belgium is not rich enough to develop that\r\nvast possession. It is an enterprise beyond her financial resources and\r\nher means of expansion.\" The French Ambassador dissented, but Herr von\r\nJagow went on to affirm that the great Powers were alone in a position\r\nto colonise, and that the small Powers were destined to disappear or\r\nto gravitate towards the orbit of the large ones. In the words of the\r\nBelgian Minister:--\r\n\r\n    Il développa l'opinion que seules les grandes Puissances\r\n    sont en situation de coloniser. Il dévoila même le fond de sa\r\n    pensée en soutenant que les petits États ne pourraient plus\r\n    mener, dans la transformation qui s'opérait en Europe au profit\r\n    des nationalités les plus fortes, par suite du développement des\r\n    forces économiques et des moyens de communication, l'existence\r\n    indépendante dont ils avaient joui jusqu'à présent. Ils étaient\r\n    destinés à disparaître ou à graviter dans l'orbite des grandes\r\n    Puissances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DER TAG\" AND ITS PROGRAMME\r\n\r\nThe story here presented of Germany's aims in Africa has taken us over\r\nalmost the entire African Continent. It now only remains to be seen how\r\nthose aims were to be realised, not merely as the outcome of Pan-German\r\ndreams and advocacy, but as the result of many years of scheming,\r\nplotting and actual preparation, all directed to the wiping out of the\r\ninfluence in Africa of other Powers, great as well as small, and the\r\nfinal realisation of Germany's long-cherished purpose.\r\n\r\nAccording to conversations Mr. O'Connor had with military officers in\r\nGerman South-West Africa just before the outbreak of war in 1914, the\r\nprogramme under which Germany hoped to become \"the supreme power in\r\nAfrica\" when \"der Tag\" so long looked forward to should arrive was, in\r\neffect, as follows:--\r\n\r\nBelgium was to be disposed of \"at one gulp.\" This would make it an easy\r\nmatter for Germany to take over the Belgian Congo.\r\n\r\nFrance would be paralysed; and, being paralysed, she would not be able\r\nto prevent Germany from succeeding to the whole of her possessions in\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThe Dervishes would stir up a rebellion in Egypt,[73] and other\r\nrebellions were anticipated in Ireland and India.\r\n\r\nWhile England was fully occupied in these directions the Afrikanders\r\nwere to rise _en masse_ and declare British South Africa an Afrikander\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nThe forces in German East Africa would make a sudden raid into British\r\nEast Africa. Having annexed that territory and got possession of the\r\nrailway, they would next invade Rhodesia from the east, in co-operation\r\nwith troops from German South-West Africa advancing to the Zambezi, via\r\nthe Caprivi Strip, from the railway terminus at Grootfontein.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile German columns would have moved (1) from the military station\r\nat Gobabis into Bechuanaland, crossing the desert of Kalahari, to effect\r\nthe capture of Vryburg; and (2) from Keetmanshoop, and other points\r\nserved by the Seeheim branch, into northern Cape Province, via Raman's\r\nDrift, Schuit Drift and the south-east corner of the territory.\r\n\r\nRhodesia having been seized, more troops would be available to proceed\r\nto the assistance of the Afrikander forces operating in the Cape\r\nProvince, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State--a \"rising\" on the\r\npart of the Afrikanders as soon as they saw a good opportunity for one\r\nbeing taken for granted. In return for the services thus rendered by her\r\nto the Afrikanders in establishing their Republic, Germany would take a\r\nportion of the Transvaal, as well as part of the Zululand coast.\r\n\r\nWith Belgium and France effectively crushed, and the power of Great\r\nBritain in South Africa broken down, those countries would no longer\r\nbe in a position to prevent Germany from annexing Portuguese Angola;\r\nand this she was to do next. She would \"allow\" the Afrikander Republic\r\nto take Delagoa Bay; but the Republic itself was to come under the\r\n\"guardianship\" of Germany. The word \"suzerainty,\" Mr. O'Connor says, was\r\nnot mentioned, \"guardianship\" being preferred; but, with the exception\r\nof Italian Somaliland--about which nothing was said--practically the\r\nwhole of Africa was either to belong to Germany or to be brought\r\ndirectly or indirectly under her control.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OBJECTIVE OF THE WORLD-WAR\r\n\r\nSince the outbreak of the World-War in 1914 there has been much\r\nspeculation as to the real objective and purpose of Germany in bringing\r\nit about.\r\n\r\nDo the facts stated in the present chapter afford any help towards a\r\nsolution of this problem?\r\n\r\nWe have seen the nature of the aims cherished by Germany towards Africa,\r\nthe practical and persistent efforts she made during a long series of\r\nyears for their attainment, and the substantial expenditure she incurred\r\nin the hope of at last securing the prize she considered was awaiting\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the purpose of Germany in Africa was less to develop\r\ncolonies for their own sake than to regard them as points from which to\r\nabsorb or to control neighbouring territories.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the development of rival railways in Central Africa had\r\nrecently threatened the supremacy Germany hoped to gain and may, indeed,\r\nhave suggested to her the need for early vigorous effort, if she wished\r\nstill to secure the realisation of her aims.\r\n\r\nWe have seen what, in the view of the German Foreign Minister, should be\r\nthe fate of small Powers which stand in the way of the aggrandisement of\r\ngreat ones.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, also, how, in the opinion of officers serving in\r\nGerman South-West Africa, the real purpose of the war to which they\r\nwere looking forward, and for which they were preparing, was the\r\nGerman annexation of Africa, and how the \"smashing up\" of France and\r\nGreat Britain, the overthrow of Belgium, the seizure of Portuguese\r\npossessions, and the virtual absorption of the proposed new Boer\r\nRepublics were to be the preliminaries to a final transformation of\r\nthe whole African Continent into a German possession--the \"new Empire\"\r\nwhich, in the words of von Weber, was to be \"possibly more valuable and\r\nmore brilliant than even the Indian Empire.\"\r\n\r\nMay one not conclude, in face of these and of all the other facts which\r\nhave here been narrated, that one, at least, of the main objectives\r\nof Germany (apart from minor ones) in provoking the Great War was no\r\nless a prize than the African Continent;[74] and that when she invaded\r\nBelgium and France she did so less with the object of annexing the\r\nformer country, and of creating another Alsace-Lorraine in the latter\r\nthan of having \"something in her hand\" with which to \"bargain\"--in the\r\ninterests of her projects in Africa--when the time came for discussing\r\nthe terms of peace, assuming that she had not already attained her\r\npurpose at the outset by the sheer force of what she thought would be\r\nher irresistible strength?\r\n\r\nIf this conclusion should seem to be warranted, on the basis of what\r\nhas already been told, it may certainly be regarded as confirmed by the\r\nfact that, down to the moment when these lines are being written, any\r\nsuggestions coming from German sources as to possible terms of peace\r\nhave invariably included proposals for the concession to Germany of\r\nterritory in Africa as \"compensation\" for the surrender of territory she\r\nhas herself occupied in Belgium and France.\r\n\r\nThus, in a despatch published in _The Times_ of September 4, 1915, a\r\nstatement was reproduced from the Chicago _Tribune_ giving, on the\r\nauthority of \"a writer in close touch with the German Embassy,\" the\r\nterms on which Germany would be prepared to agree to peace. These terms\r\nincluded the following:--\r\n\r\n    The cession of the Belgian Congo to Germany, as compensation\r\n    for the evacuation of Belgium.\r\n\r\n    The cession of African colonial territory to Germany by\r\n    France, as compensation for the evacuation of Northern France.\r\n\r\nThen, also, on October 24, 1915, the _New York American_ published a\r\nlong interview with Professor Hans Delbrück on the terms of peace which\r\nGermany hoped to secure if \"President Wilson and the Pope\" would consent\r\nto act as mediators. The interview (which had been approved by the\r\nGerman censor) included the following passage:--\r\n\r\n    It is quite possible that peace could be secured by ceding\r\n    to Germany such colonies as Uganda by England and the French\r\n    and Belgian Congos as a ransom for the evacuation by Germany of\r\n    Northern France and Belgium.\r\n\r\nSuch concessions, if one can conceive the possibility of their being\r\nmade--would still leave Germany far from the attainment of her full\r\nAfrican programme; but the fact of these proposals being put forward at\r\nall as \"terms of peace\" is quite in keeping with the whole course of\r\nGermany's policy in Africa, and points clearly to what may, in fact,\r\nhave been her chief objective in the war itself.\r\n\r\nAny moral reflections either on the said policy or on the \"programme\" by\r\nmeans of which it was to have been carried out would be beyond the scope\r\nof the present work.\r\n\r\nWhat we are here concerned in is the fact that Germany's dreams of\r\nan African Empire, given expression to by von Weber in 1880, and the\r\nsubject of such continuous effort ever since, were, in the possibilities\r\nof their realisation, based primarily on the extension and utilisation\r\nof such facilities for rail-transport as she might be able either to\r\ncreate or to acquire.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[55] See Vol. III. of \"The Story of Africa,\" by Robert Brown.

A\r\nGerman White Book on the rebellion stated that the cause of the outbreak\r\nwas the spirit of independence which characterised the Hereros, \"to\r\nwhom the increasing domination of the Germans had become insupportable,\r\nand who believed themselves stronger than the whites.\" According to Mr.\r\nH. A. Bryden (\"The Conquest of German South-West Africa,\" _Fortnightly\r\nReview_, July, 1915) the real causes were the abuses of the white\r\ntrader, the brutal methods of certain officials, and the seizure and\r\noccupation of tribal lands. The war developed into one of practical\r\nextermination for the natives concerned. Of the Hereros between 20,000\r\nand 30,000 were either killed outright or driven into the Kalahari\r\ndesert to die of starvation. The Hottentots also lost heavily.\r\n\r\n[59] The Commerce Defence League, as explained by the writer of the\r\narticle, is an organisation of German traders which gives subsidies to\r\nGerman clerks so that they can take up appointments at nominal salaries\r\nin foreign countries, on the understanding that they are to report to\r\nthe League as to the business methods, etc., of those countries and on\r\nopenings for German trade or industry therein, the League acting on such\r\ninformation and dividing among its subscribers the profits derived from\r\nthe agencies opened or the competitive businesses started.\r\n\r\n[60] See _South Africa_, November 14, 1914.\r\n\r\n[61] \"Memorandum on the Country known as German South-West Africa.\r\nCompiled from such information as is at present available to the\r\nGovernment of the Union of South Africa.\" Pretoria, 1915.\r\n\r\n[62] The colony was also in wireless-telegraphic communication, via\r\nTogoland, with Berlin.\r\n\r\n[63] For details of so-called \"invasions\" of Portuguese territory by\r\nGerman political agents, posing as engineers and prospectors, see an\r\narticle on \"The Invasion of Angola,\" by Mr. George Bailey, in the issue\r\nof \"United Empire: The Royal Colonial Institute Journal,\" for October,\r\n1915.\r\n\r\n[64] \"Le Chemin de Fer du Tanganyika et les progrès de l'Afrique\r\norientale allemande.\" Par Camille Martin.

Professor Delbrück, while agreeing with Herr Rohrbach,\r\nas to the importance of Central Africa, as well as of Angola and the\r\nwhole of British East Africa, further emphasises the necessity for the\r\nacquisition of the Sudan and the southern part of the Sahara, now in\r\nthe possession of France. We are quite in agreement with these eminent\r\nleaders that we must found an \"India\" of our own, and that the greater\r\npart of the African continent must furnish the requisite territory.\r\nOnce well established in this new empire, we shall link ourselves with\r\nAsiatic Turkey, and also with China, reconstructing the political and\r\neconomic foundations of both on a scientific German basis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nDESIGNS ON ASIATIC TURKEY\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as avowedly strategical lines in Africa were to lead the way to the\r\ncreation of a German African Empire, so, in turn, was that system of\r\neconomic-political-strategical lines comprised within the scheme of what\r\nis known as the \"Baghdad Railway\" designed to ensure the establishment\r\nof a German Middle-Asian Empire, bringing under German control the\r\nentire region from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf, and providing\r\nconvenient stepping-off places from which an advance might be made on\r\nEgypt in the one direction and India in the other.\r\n\r\nThe conception of this further programme was spread over (1) the period\r\nduring which Germany's aspirations were limited to the inheritance of\r\nTurkey's possessions in Asia; and (2) the period when such inheritance\r\nbegan to be regarded as a means to the realisation of still greater aims\r\nin the domain of Weltpolitik.\r\n\r\nFor more than half a century Asiatic Turkey has been looked upon as\r\nGermany's Land of Promise. Anatolia was thought a most desirable\r\nterritory for her surplus population. The development, under German\r\ninfluence, of that territory as a whole--especially with a revival\r\nof the Babylonian system of irrigation--was considered to offer vast\r\npossibilities of commercial prosperity. Wheat, cotton and tobacco,\r\nespecially, might be raised in prodigious quantities, and there was the\r\nprospect, also, of a petroleum industry rivalling that of Baku itself.\r\nTurkey was a decadent nation, and as soon as \"the Sick Man\" succumbed\r\nto his apparently inevitable fate--or even before, should circumstances\r\npermit--Germany was ready to step into his shoes.\r\n\r\nThat these aspirations had, indeed, long been cherished is a fact\r\ncapable of ready proof.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Wilhelm Roscher, the leading expounder of the historical school\r\nof political economy in Germany, selected Asia Minor as Germany's share\r\nin the Turkish spoils, whenever the division thereof should take place;\r\nand Johann Karl Robertus (1805-1875), the founder of the so-called\r\nscientific socialism in Germany, expressed the hope that he would live\r\nlong enough to see Turkey fall into the hands of Germany, and, also, to\r\nsee German soldiers on the shores of the Bosporus.\r\n\r\nComing to a more recent period, we find that Dr. Aloys Sprenger, the\r\nGerman orientalist, published, in 1886, a pamphlet on \"Babylonia, the\r\nrichest land in the past, and the most promising field for colonisation\r\nin the present,\"[75] in which, after dealing with the history, physical\r\nconditions and resources of Babylonia, he predicted that, before the end\r\nof the century, not only Babylonia but Assyria, which was inseparable\r\nfrom it, would, if not formally annexed, at least come under the control\r\nof some European Power. Assyria and Syria, he declared, were even better\r\nadapted for colonisation than Babylonia. He continued:--\r\n\r\n    The Orient is the only territory on earth which has not yet\r\n    been taken possession of by some aspiring nation. It offers the\r\n    finest opportunities for colonisation, and if Germany, taking\r\n    care not to let the opportunity slip, should act before the\r\n    Cossacks come along, she would, in the division of the world,\r\n    get the best share.... The German Kaiser, as soon as a few\r\n    hundred thousand armed German colonists bring these promising\r\n    fields into cultivation, will have in his hand the fate of Asia\r\n    Minor, and he can--and will--then become the Protector of Peace\r\n    for the whole of Asia.\r\n\r\nDr. Karl Kaerger, traveller and economist, lamented, in his \"Kleinasien;\r\nein deutsches Kolonisationsfeld\" (Berlin, 1892), the enormous loss\r\nsustained by Germany in the migration of so many of her people and of so\r\nmuch capital to Anglo-Saxon lands; but there were, he affirmed, only two\r\ncountries to which German settlers could go with any hope of retaining\r\nalike their nationality and their commercial relations with the\r\n_Mutterland_. Those countries were--Africa and Asia Minor. He had been\r\nespecially impressed, during the course of his travels, by the prospects\r\nand possibilities of Anatolia, and he recommended the establishment\r\nthere of large German companies which would organise schemes of\r\ncolonisation and land cultivation on a large scale. The colonies so\r\nestablished should be self-governing, free from all taxation for ten\r\nyears, have the right of duty-free importation of necessaries, and enjoy\r\nvarious other privileges, while Turkey, in return for the concessions\r\nshe thus made to the settlers, would be assured \"the protection of\r\nGermany against attack.\" Not only hundreds of thousands, but millions,\r\nof colonists could find a second home on those wide expanses. Germany\r\nherself would gain a dual advantage--an economical one, and a political\r\none. Concerning the latter, Dr. Kaerger observed:--\r\n\r\n    If the German Empire, while maintaining her friendship with\r\n    Austria and Italy--which, under all circumstances, the political\r\n    situation in Europe undoubtedly requires--can direct the stream\r\n    of her emigration to the fertile territories of Turkey, and if\r\n    she can conclude with that country a closer customs convention,\r\n    then the entire economic, and with it, also, the political\r\n    future of Germany will rest on a broader and a firmer basis\r\n    than if the present streams of hundreds of thousands of her\r\n    people, and millions of capital, continue to pass in increasing\r\n    proportions, year by year, to countries which are economically\r\n    hostile to us.\r\n\r\nDr. Kaerger was especially concerned lest Germany might be anticipated\r\nby Russia or England in the realisation of her own designs on Asia\r\nMinor. Should, he declared, either of those countries acquire any\r\nfurther territory from Turkey, or increase in any way Turkey's\r\ndependence upon them, the result would be the most serious disturbance\r\nof the prevailing situation in Europe that had occurred since 1870.\r\n\r\nThe development of all these ideas went so far that in 1895 the\r\n_Alldeutscher Blätter_ recommended that Germany should establish a\r\nProtectorate over the Turkish possessions in Asia Minor; and in the\r\nfollowing year the _Alldeutscher_ _Verband_ published a manifesto on\r\n\"German claims to the Inheritance of Turkey\" (\"Deutschlands Anspruch an\r\ndas türkische Erbe\"), making a formal statement of Germany's alleged\r\nrights to the Turkish succession.\r\n\r\nGermany had by this time already secured a footing on the soil of\r\nAsiatic Turkey by virtue of the _Anatolian Railway_. The first\r\nsection--a length of about seventy miles, extending from Haidar Pacha\r\n(situate on the north-eastern coast of the Sea of Marmara, and opposite\r\nConstantinople) to Ismidt--was built in 1875 by German engineers to\r\nthe order of the Turkish Government. It was transferred in 1888 to a\r\nGerman syndicate, nominees of the Deutsche Bank. Under the powers then\r\nconferred upon them, the syndicate opened an extension, on the east, to\r\nAngora, in 1892, and another, on the south, to Konia, in 1896, the total\r\nlength of line being thus increased to 633 miles.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the visit of the German Emperor to Constantinople in\r\n1898, followed by negotiations between the Porte and the director of\r\nthe Deutsche Bank, authority was given to a new German Company--the\r\nImperial Ottoman Baghdad Railway Company--under conventions of 1889,\r\n1902 and 1903, to continue the existing Anatolian Railway from Konia to\r\nthe Persian Gulf, via Adana, Nisibin, Mosul and Baghdad. This extension\r\nwas to constitute the main line of the _Baghdad Railway_ proper; but the\r\nCompany also acquired control over most of the branch railways already\r\nin operation. One of these was the French Smyrna--Afium Karahissar line,\r\nwhich constitutes the direct trade route between Smyrna and places\r\nserved by the Anatolian railway, and has, also, a branch to Panderma, on\r\nthe southern shores of the Sea of Marmara. Another was the short line\r\nfrom Adana to Mersina, giving access to the Mediterranean. This meant\r\nthe substitution of German for French interests, while the course taken\r\nby the Anatolia-Baghdad Railway from the Bosporus to Adana shut off the\r\npossibility of an extension of the British line from Smyrna via Aidin to\r\nEgerdir (west of Konia) into the interior.\r\n\r\nThen in 1911 the Company acquired the right to build a _new port at\r\nAlexandretta_, with quays, docks, bonded warehouses, etc., and to\r\nconstruct thence a short line of railway connecting with the Baghdad\r\nmain line at Osmanieh, east of Adana. By these means the Germans\r\nacquired the control over, if not an actual monopoly of, the traffic\r\nbetween one of the most important ports on the eastern sea-board of the\r\nMediterranean--a port where a trade valued at three and a half million\r\nsterling is already being done--and the vast extent of territory in Asia\r\nMinor designed to be served by the Baghdad Railway.\r\n\r\nFrom Muslimiyeh, a little town on the north of Aleppo, there is a short\r\nbranch connecting the Baghdad Railway with the _Hedjaz line_ from\r\nDamascus to Medina, which is eventually to be carried on to Mecca;\r\nwhile from Rayak, north of Damascus, a branch built in a south-westerly\r\ndirection was to be carried to within a short distance of the Egyptian\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nFrom the junction for the Aleppo branch, the main line was to continue\r\nacross the Mesopotamian plain to Baghdad (whence a branch to Khanikin,\r\non the Persian frontier was projected) and so on to Basra, for the\r\nPersian Gulf.\r\n\r\nThus the scheme for what passes under the title of the Baghdad Railway\r\nembraces three separate and distinct regions of Asiatic Turkey--(1)\r\nAnatolia, (2) Syria and (3) Mesopotamia. In other words, whereas in\r\ntheir first phase, German aspirations for Turkish territory were based\r\non the economic advantages of settlement in Anatolia--a region in\r\nitself large enough to accommodate all the Germans who were likely\r\nto want to settle there--in the second phase those aspirations were\r\nbased on an extension of the Baghdad Railway towards Egypt in the\r\none direction and the Persian Gulf in the other. This dual extension\r\nbecame the more noticeable, also, inasmuch as for the passage of the\r\nTaurus range of mountains a total of nearly 100 miles of blasting and\r\ntunnelling would have to be carried out, the cost of construction on\r\ncertain sections of the line rising to between £35,000 and £40,000 a\r\nmile. The extension, therefore, was likely to be a costly business, the\r\ntotal length of the Baghdad Railway proper, apart from the Anatolian\r\nsystem, being, as projected, about 1,350 miles, of which, however,\r\nonly about 600 miles were, in June, 1915, available for traffic.[76]\r\nAdmitting the desirability of opening up Mesopotamia to commercial and\r\nagricultural development, it may, nevertheless, be asked, were there\r\nother motives--and motives to which still greater weight might have been\r\nattached--for this expansion of the earlier designs?\r\n\r\nAbdul Hamid's reason for granting the concession is said to have been\r\nthat the extension of the line to the Persian Gulf would greatly\r\nstrengthen the military position of Turkey, since it would enable her to\r\neffect a speedy transfer of troops between the Bosporus and the Gulf, or\r\nintermediate places, as against the many months that might be occupied\r\nby marching on foot across plains and mountains.\r\n\r\nGermany's reasons for seeking to construct the Baghdad Railway, its\r\nbranches and connections, to the full extent of the programme laid\r\ndown, were, not simply the development of new trade routes, as certain\r\ninspired representations have sought to make the world believe, and not\r\nsimply the gain of various other economic advantages, but (1) a desire\r\nto increase German influence over Turkey; to strengthen her military\r\nand other resources with a view to employing them eventually in the\r\nadvancement of Germany's own interests; and to ensure the realisation\r\nof that eventual Protectorate over Turkey which would convert the\r\ncountry into practically a German province; and (2) the furthering\r\nof Germany's aims against Great Britain in the belief that she, too,\r\nwas a decadent country whose possessions, when we could no longer\r\ndefend them effectively, Germany would be the more likely to secure\r\nfor herself if, with a concentration of Turkish forces to assist her,\r\nshe were established within striking distance of some of the most\r\nvulnerable points of the British Empire, ready to take instant advantage\r\nof any favourable opportunity that might present itself, whether in a\r\nprospective break-up of that Empire or otherwise.\r\n\r\nOf evidence concerning Germany's efforts to obtain increasing influence\r\nover Turkey there is no lack.\r\n\r\nWe have, in the first place, the fact that in 1882 a German military\r\nmission, of which General the Baron Colmar von der Goltz was the\r\nprincipal member, undertook the training of the Turkish Army according\r\nto the principles of German military science, with the result that the\r\nTurkish Army became a more efficient instrument for the attainment, not\r\nonly of her own aims or purposes, but those, also, of Germany herself.\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser, although the supreme head of the Lutheran Church, and\r\nalthough having no Mohammedan subjects of his own, sought to pose as the\r\nchampion of Mohammedans in general and the Defender of _their_ Faith.\r\nDuring his visit to Damascus in November, 1898, he declared--\"May the\r\nSultan, may the three hundred million Mohammedans living who, scattered\r\nthroughout the earth, honour in his person their Caliph, rest assured\r\nthat at all times the German Kaiser will be their friend.\"[77]\r\n\r\nWhenever political trouble threatened to fall upon Turkey, as the result\r\nof such occurrences as the Armenian and Macedonian atrocities or the\r\ninsurrection in Crete, it was Germany who became her champion as against\r\nthe other Powers of Europe.\r\n\r\nEverything possible was done to push German trade in Turkey and to\r\nestablish closer commercial relations with her. There came a time when\r\nevery city of importance in the Turkish Empire was declared to be\r\n\"overrun with German bankers, German clerks and German bagmen.\"\r\n\r\nNot only, too, were German engineers active in seeking to get\r\nconcessions for new railways, and not only were German financiers\r\nequally active in endeavouring to control existing ones, but, as Dr.\r\nCharles Sarolea points out, in his book on \"The Anglo-German Problem,\"\r\nthere are, in the agreements between the Baghdad Railway Company and the\r\nPorte, financial clauses which must ultimately place Turkey entirely at\r\nthe mercy of her professed champion. \"In Turkey Germany alone would rule\r\nsupreme\"; and the aspirations for a German Protectorate over Turkey,\r\nwith the Sultan as a vassal of Germany, would then be realised.\r\n\r\nWriting on the position as he found it in 1903, M. André Chéradame said\r\nin \"La Question d'Orient\":--\r\n\r\n    More and more the Germans seem to regard the land of\r\n    the Turks as their personal property. All the recent German\r\n    literature relating to Turkey affords proof of the tendency. An\r\n    ordinary book of travels is entitled, \"In Asia Minor, by German\r\n    Railways.\" In his \"Pan-Germanic Atlas\" Paul Langhams gives a\r\n    map of \"German Railways in Asia Minor.\" So it is, indeed, a\r\n    matter of the organised conquest of Turkey. Everywhere and in\r\n    everything, Turkey is being encircled by the tentacles of the\r\n    German octopus.\r\n\r\nComing, next, to the nature of _Germany's aims against England_ and the\r\npart which the Baghdad Railway was to play in their attainment, we have\r\nthe frank confessions of Dr. Paul Rohrbach, an authority on the subject\r\nof Germany's Weltpolitik, and a traveller who has paid four visits to\r\nAsia Minor. In \"Die Baghdadbahn\" (2nd. edition, 1911) he tells us that\r\nLudwig Ross, a professor at Halle who was well acquainted with Anatolia,\r\nwas the first to point to Asia Minor as a desirable place for German\r\nsettlement. At the outset economic considerations were alone concerned,\r\nand in Bismarck's day Germany's relations to England played only a minor\r\nrôle in her foreign politics; but in proportion as Germany's interests\r\nwere developed and her soil no longer provided sufficient food for her\r\npeople or sufficient raw products for her manufactures, she had to look\r\nabroad for the supply of her surplus needs. In so doing, however, her\r\ninterests abroad might be endangered by the British Fleet. Hence the\r\nnecessity for a German Fleet; and, although the German sea-power might\r\nnot be strong enough, by itself, to attack and conquer England, it\r\ncould bring certain considerations home to English policy. Dr. Rohrbach\r\ncontinues:--\r\n\r\n    If it came to a matter of war with England, it would be for\r\n    Germany simply a question of life and death. The possibility\r\n    of a successful issue for Germany depends exclusively on one\r\n    consideration, namely, on whether or not we can succeed in\r\n    bringing England herself into a dangerous position. That end\r\n    can in no way be obtained by means of a direct attack across\r\n    the North Sea; any idea of a German invasion of England being\r\n    possible is a mere phantasy. One must seek, therefore, another\r\n    combination in order to assail England at some vulnerable spot;\r\n    and here we come to the point where the relations of Germany to\r\n    Turkey, and the conditions prevailing in Turkey, are found to\r\n    be of decisive importance for German foreign policy. There is,\r\n    in fact, only one means possible by which Germany can resist a\r\n    war of aggression by England, and that is the strengthening of\r\n    Turkey.\r\n\r\n    England can, from Europe, be attacked by land and mortally\r\n    wounded only in one place--Egypt. If England were to lose Egypt\r\n    she would lose, not only her control over the Suez Canal and her\r\n    connexions with India and the Far East, but, presumably, also,\r\n    her possessions in Central and East Africa. The conquest of\r\n    Egypt by a Mohammedan Power, such as Turkey, might, in addition,\r\n    have a dangerous effect on her 60,000,000 Mohammedan subjects in\r\n    India, besides being to her prejudice in Afghanistan and Persia.\r\n\r\n    Turkey, however, can never dream of recovering Egypt until\r\n    she controls a fully-developed railway system in Asia Minor\r\n    and Syria; until, by the extension of the Anatolian Railway to\r\n    Baghdad, she can resist an attack by England on Mesopotamia;\r\n    until her army has been increased and improved; and until\r\n    progress has been made in her general economic and financial\r\n    conditions.... The stronger Turkey becomes, the greater will be\r\n    the danger for England if, in a German-English conflict, Turkey\r\n    should be on the side of Germany; and, with Egypt for a prize,\r\n    it certainly would be worth the while of Turkey to run the risk\r\n    of fighting with Germany against England. On the other hand the\r\n    mere fact that Turkey had increased in military strength, had\r\n    improved her economic position, and had an adequate railway\r\n    system, would make England hesitate to attack Germany; and this\r\n    is the point at which Germany must aim. The policy of supporting\r\n    Turkey which is now being followed by Germany has no other\r\n    purpose than that of effecting a strong measure against the\r\n    danger of war with England.\r\n\r\nFrom other directions, besides, similar testimony was forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist _Liepziger Volkszeitung_ declared in March, 1911, that\r\n\"the new situation shortly to be created in Asia Minor would hasten the\r\nbreak-up of the British Empire, which was already beginning to totter\r\n(schwanken).\"\r\n\r\nIn _Die Neue Zeit_ for June 2, 1911, Herr Karl Radek said:--\r\n\r\n    The strengthening of German Imperialism, the first success\r\n    of which, attained with so much effort, is the Baghdad Railway;\r\n    the victory of the revolutionary party in Turkey; the prospect\r\n    of a modern revolutionary movement in India, which, of course,\r\n    must be regarded as a very different thing from the earlier\r\n    scattered risings of individual tribes; the movement towards\r\n    nationalisation in Egypt; the beginning of reform in Egypt--all\r\n    this has raised to an extraordinary degree the political\r\n    significance of the Baghdad Railway question.\r\n\r\n    The Baghdad Railway being a blow at the interests of English\r\n    Imperialism, Turkey could only entrust its construction to the\r\n    German Company because she knew that Germany's army and navy\r\n    stood behind her, which fact makes it appear to England and\r\n    Russia inadvisable to exert too sensitive a pressure upon Turkey.\r\n\r\nIn the _Akademische Blätter_ of June 1, 1911, Professor R. Mangelsdorf,\r\nanother recognised authority on German policy and politics, wrote:--\r\n\r\n    The political and military power an organised railway\r\n    system will confer upon Turkey is altogether in the interest\r\n    of Germany, which can only obtain a share in actual economic\r\n    developments if Turkey is independent; and, besides, any attempt\r\n    to increase the power and ambition of England, in any case\r\n    oppressively great, is thereby effectively thwarted. To some\r\n    extent, indeed, Turkey's construction of a railway system is\r\n    a threat to England, for it means that an attack on the most\r\n    vulnerable part of the body of England's world-empire, namely\r\n    Egypt, comes well within the bounds of possibility.\r\n\r\nThese declarations and admissions render perfectly clear the reasons for\r\nGermany's professions of friendship for Turkey and for her desire that\r\nthat country should become stronger and more powerful. They also leave\r\nno doubt as to the real purpose the south-western branch of the Baghdad\r\nRailway was designed to effect. The _conquest of Egypt_ by a combined\r\nGerman and Turkish force was the first object to be accomplished\r\nwith the help of the railway extension to the Egyptian frontier in\r\none direction and to Mecca in another; but Dr. Rohrbach's suggestion\r\nthat the loss of Egypt by England would entail the loss, also, of her\r\npossessions in Central and East Africa has a further bearing on what has\r\nbeen told in the previous chapter concerning Germany's designs on Africa\r\nas a whole. The strategical railways in German South-West Africa; the\r\nprojected extensions thereof--when circumstances permitted; the German\r\nEast African lines, _and_ the south-western branch of the Baghdad\r\nRailway in the direction of Egypt were all to play their part in the\r\neventual creation of a Cape-to-Cairo German-African Empire.\r\n\r\nIf we now direct our attention to the south-eastern branch of the\r\nBaghdad Railway, we are met by the repeated protests made by Germany\r\nthat in desiring the construction of a railway to the _Persian Gulf_\r\nshe was influenced solely by commercial considerations. Against these\r\nprotests, however, there are to be put various material facts which\r\nleave no room for doubt that Germany's aims in this direction were\r\notherwise than exclusively economic, while even the economic purposes\r\nwhich the Baghdad Railway would, undoubtedly, have served must have\r\neventually led to a strengthening of Germany's political position, this,\r\nin turn, helping her military and strategical purposes.\r\n\r\nAs originally planned, the port of Basra (the commercial centre of\r\ntrade in Mesopotamia, situate, sixty miles from the sea, on the\r\nShat-el-Arab--the great river formed by the junction of the Tigris and\r\nthe Euphrates--and open to the shipping of the world) was to have been\r\nthe terminus of the Baghdad Railway; and if commercial considerations\r\nhad, indeed, been exclusively aimed at, this terminus would have\r\nanswered all requirements.\r\n\r\nNo objection was, or could be, raised by the British Government to the\r\nconstruction of the Baghdad Railway, on Turkish territory, as far as\r\nBasra. In the later developments of the scheme, however, Germany and her\r\nTurkish partner sought to ensure the continuation of the line from its\r\nnatural commercial terminus, at Basra, to a political and strategical\r\nterminus, at Koweit, on the shores of the Persian Gulf. The _Abendpost_\r\n(Berlin) voiced the German view when it spoke of Koweit as \"the only\r\npossible outlet to the Baghdad Railway.\"\r\n\r\nBut the extension of an avowedly German line of railway to Koweit would\r\nhave been a direct challenge to the paramountcy which Great Britain\r\nclaimed over the Persian Gulf. It would have come into collision with\r\nBritish policy, interests and prestige in the East. It would have\r\ngiven the German and Turkish allies an excuse for creating at Koweit a\r\nharbour, with wharves, docks, warehouses, etc., which might be converted\r\ninto a naval and military base capable of serving far different purposes\r\nthan those of trade and commerce--those, namely, of a new line of\r\nadvance on _India_. It would, in combination with the control already\r\nexercised by the Deutsche Bank over the railways in European Turkey,\r\nhave assured to Germany the means of sending her Naval forces or her\r\ntroops, together with supplies and ammunition, direct to the Persian\r\nGulf, either to strengthen her fleet or to carry out any further designs\r\nshe might cherish in the domain of Weltpolitik as affecting the Far\r\nEast. It would have meant that, as far as the head of the Persian Gulf,\r\nat least, rail-power would have rendered her less dependent on the\r\nexercise of sea-power, on her own account, and would have enabled her to\r\nneutralise, also, as far as the said Gulf, the sea-power of England.\r\n\r\nWhat so fundamental a change in the strategical position might imply was\r\nwell expressed by so eminent and impartial an authority as A. T. Mahan,\r\nwhen he said, in his \"Retrospect and Prospect\" (1902):--\r\n\r\n    The control of the Persian Gulf by a foreign State of\r\n    considerable naval potentiality, a \"fleet in being\" there, based\r\n    upon a strong military port, would reproduce the relations of\r\n    Cadiz, Gibraltar and Malta to the Mediterranean. It would flank\r\n    all the routes to the Farther East, to India and to Australia,\r\n    the last two actually internal to the Empire, regarded as\r\n    a political system; and, although at present Great Britain\r\n    unquestionably could check such a fleet, it might well require a\r\n    detachment large enough to affect seriously the general strength\r\n    of her naval position.... Concession in the Persian Gulf,\r\n    whether by positive formal arrangement, or by simple neglect\r\n    of the local commercial interests which now underlie political\r\n    and military control, will imperil Great Britain's naval\r\n    situation in the Farther East, her political position in India,\r\n    her commercial interests in both, and the Imperial tie between\r\n    herself and Australia.\r\n\r\nOne is thus led to the conclusion that Koweit, as the terminus of\r\nthe south-eastern branch of the Baghdad Railway, and within four days\r\nof Bombay, would have been as vital a point for British interests as\r\nthe terminus of the south-western branch within about twelve hours of\r\nEgypt; while the possession of this further advantage by Germany would\r\nhave been in full accord with the proposition laid down by Rohrbach\r\nand others as to the line of policy Germany should adopt for \"bringing\r\nEngland herself into a dangerous position.\"\r\n\r\nWith a view to safeguarding British interests from any possible\r\ndrifting into this position, as regards the Persian Gulf, the claim\r\nwas raised, some years ago, that England should have entire control\r\nof the railway from Baghdad to Koweit. Germany did not see her way\r\nto assent to this proposal; but in 1911 she announced that she would\r\nforgo her right to construct the section from Baghdad to Basra on the\r\nunderstanding that this final section would be completed by Turkey.\r\nBy way of compensation for the concession thus made by her to British\r\nviews, she secured certain financial advantages and the right both to\r\nbuild the Alexandretta extension and to convert Alexandretta itself into\r\npractically a German port on the shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe precise value of the \"concession\" thus made by Germany was, however,\r\nopen to considerable doubt. If she could succeed in her long-cherished\r\naim of establishing a virtual protectorate over Turkey, then the fact\r\nthat the final section of the Baghdad Railway had been built by Turkey,\r\nand not by Germany, would have become a matter of detail not likely to\r\naffect the reality of Germany's control. The line to Basra might have\r\nbeen nominally Turkish but the directing policy would have been German;\r\nand like conditions would have arisen had Great Britain agreed to allow\r\nTurkey--though not Germany--to continue the railway from Basra to Koweit.\r\n\r\nIn the wide scope of their aggressive purpose, the Baghdad Railway\r\nand its associated lines can best be compared with those roads which\r\nthe Romans, in the days of their pride--the pride that came before\r\ntheir fall--built for the better achievement of their own aims as\r\nworld-conquerors. Apart from the fact that the roads now in question are\r\niron roads, and that the locomotive has superseded the chariot, the main\r\ndifference between Roman and German is to be found in the fact that the\r\nworld which the former sought to conquer was far smaller than the one\r\ncoveted by the latter.\r\n\r\nThe programme of Weltpolitik comprised in the German schemes embraced\r\nnot only countries but continents. In addition to the aspirations\r\ncherished as regards Europe, that programme aimed at the eventual\r\nannexation to the German Empire of three other Empires--the Turkish,\r\nthe Indian, and a new one to be known as the German-African. It was\r\nfurther to secure the means of sending troops direct from Germany via\r\nConstantinople and the Baghdad Railway to the frontiers of Persia\r\nfor possible operations against that country in combination with the\r\nTurkish military forces, these having first been brought under German\r\ncontrol. The Baghdad Railway itself was, in the same way, and with like\r\nsupport, to afford to Germany the means of threatening Russian interests\r\nboth in Persia and in Trans-Caucasia. It was to nullify England's sea\r\npower in the Mediterranean, if not, to a certain extent--through the\r\nestablishment of a new Power at the gate of India--in the Far East, as\r\nwell. It would, as Mahan showed, have flanked our communications with\r\nAustralia, giving Germany an advantage in this direction, also, had Asia\r\nand Africa failed to satisfy her aspirations.\r\n\r\nRegarded from the point of view of its designed effect on the destinies\r\nof nations, on the balance of political power, and on the reconstruction\r\nof the world's forces--all for the aggrandisement of a single\r\npeople--the full programme must be looked upon as the most ambitious and\r\nthe most unscrupulous project of world-conquest that has yet been placed\r\non record in the history of mankind.\r\n\r\nFor its attainment, however, it clearly depended no less upon\r\nrail-transport than upon force of arms; and in this respect it\r\nrepresented Germany's greatest attempt to apply, in practice, that\r\nprinciple of rail-power to which she had devoted eight decades of\r\ninquiry, trial and organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[75] \"Babylonien, das reichste Land in der Vorzeit und das lohnendste\r\nKolonisationsfeld für die Gegenwart.\" 128 pp. Heidelberg, 1886.\r\n\r\n[76] Important extensions have been carried out since.\r\n\r\n[77] Dr. Dillon, in _The Contemporary Review_, April, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs will have been gathered from the preceding chapters, a prolonged\r\nperiod of consideration, preparation and application in many different\r\ncountries throughout the world, prior to the outbreak of the Great\r\nWar in 1914, had established certain definite facts and fundamental\r\nprinciples in regard to the relations of railways to warfare in\r\ngeneral. These may now be brought together and summarised in four\r\ngroups or divisions, namely, (A) Advantages; (B) Conditions Essential\r\nto Efficiency; (C) Limitations in Usefulness; and (D) Drawbacks and\r\nDisadvantages.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.--ADVANTAGES\r\n\r\nAssuming (1) the provision, in advance, of a system or systems of\r\nrailways capable of meeting all the requirements of the military\r\nsituation on the outbreak of war, or (2) the possibility of constructing\r\nmilitary railways during the progress of hostilities, such railways\r\nshould permit of--\r\n\r\nA mobilisation of troops and their concentration at the frontier, or\r\nat the seat of war, with a speed that was impossible under earlier\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nSimultaneous use of different routes across the national territory\r\nfor concentration either on the frontier or at a point some distance\r\ntherefrom where the concentration can be completed without fear of\r\ninterruption by the enemy.\r\n\r\nSudden invasion of neighbouring territory by troops sent in a succession\r\nof rapidly-following trains direct from various points in the interior\r\nof the country where they might have been concentrated without the\r\nknowledge of the enemy, this procedure being adopted in preference to\r\ncollecting at the frontier in advance a force on such a scale as would\r\ndisclose prematurely the intentions entertained.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of using promptly, for these purposes, the full strength\r\nof the country's available resources--the railway lines in the interior\r\nhaving already been adapted thereto, as well as those on or directly\r\nconnecting with the frontier--with a proportionate increase of the\r\noffensive and defensive power of the State.\r\n\r\nThe supplementing of increased mobility and celerity by decreased\r\nstrain on the physical powers of the troops and the avoidance of such\r\ninevitable reduction in their numbers as would result from the trials\r\nand fatigues of prolonged marches by road (in combination with the\r\ncarrying of kits, etc.), should railway lines not be available.\r\n\r\nA further consequent increase in the fighting strength of the army.\r\n\r\nThe possible attainment of the power of initiative through an early\r\nconcentration of large forces at points of strategic importance either\r\non national or on enemy's territory.[78]\r\n\r\nThe carrying out of strategical combinations on a scale or of a\r\ncharacter which would formerly have been impracticable.\r\n\r\nEmployment of railways for tactical purposes during the progress of\r\na war, including therein (_a_) movement of troops from one part of\r\nthe theatre of war to another, whether with a view to effecting big\r\nchanges of front or otherwise; (_b_) employment of the same Army Corps\r\non different fronts in succession, their transfer being effected in\r\nthe briefest possible interval of time; (_c_) the rapid bringing up\r\nof reinforcements at a critical moment to some position exposed to\r\noverpowering attack which might otherwise be lost; (_d_) surprise\r\nattacks on the enemy; (_e_) the throwing of great masses of troops on\r\ndistant points; (_f_) strengthening weak places in the fighting line;\r\n(_g_) strengthening threatened forts by means of troops, guns, munitions\r\nor supplies; (_h_) relief of invested fortresses, and (_i_) retirement\r\nby rail--when circumstances permit--of troops after defeat.\r\n\r\nControl of a line of rail communication between the base and the\r\nstrategic centre of operations, facilitating the enormous amount of\r\ntransport in both directions which must be kept up in the rear of the\r\narmy, and for which the elements of speed, safety and regularity may be\r\nof vital importance.\r\n\r\nThe possibility, thanks to railways, of regarding the whole interior of\r\nthe national territory as a base for the supply of requirements at the\r\nfront, dependence having no longer to be placed on a base established in\r\none particular district with its restricted range of possible supplies\r\nand its collection of magazines, stores, workshops, transport parks,\r\netc., protected by fortresses, entrenched camps, or other means of\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of supplementary, sectional or advanced bases along\r\nthe line of communication, with railway services so arranged that\r\nsupplies can be dispatched daily in such regulated quantities, and to\r\nsuch points, as will serve the immediate needs of the army in the field,\r\nwithout risk either of shortage or of excess.\r\n\r\nAvoidance, under these conditions, of congestion of the railway lines\r\nin the immediate rear of the army by trains or loaded wagons containing\r\na redundancy of supplies which (_a_) cannot be unloaded, (_b_) restrict\r\nthe use of the lines for other purposes, and (_c_) might have to be\r\nabandoned to the enemy in the event of a sudden retreat.\r\n\r\nMaterial benefits from the substitution of rail for road transport of\r\nfood, etc., by reason of (_a_) greater speed and regularity; (_b_)\r\nless risk of deterioration from exposure to weather, and other causes;\r\n(_c_) decreased cost of transport as compared with earlier conditions\r\ninvolving the employment of a greater number of drivers, escort,\r\nguards, horses and road vehicles; and (_d_) the arrival at destination\r\nof the full quantities dispatched, the need for the consumption of an\r\nappreciable proportion _en route_ by men and animals in a convoying\r\nwagon train, carrying supplies for long distances by road, being\r\nnon-existent.\r\n\r\nReduction in the need for field ovens and other paraphernalia of the\r\narmy cook, since much of the food required--bread, for example--can\r\nbe prepared in cities or elsewhere at a distant base and forwarded\r\nregularly by rail.\r\n\r\nFreedom, more or less complete, from the once prevalent obligation on\r\nthe part of an advancing army that it should \"live upon the country\"--a\r\ncondition which the enormous increase in the size of armies to-day would\r\nrender impossible of fulfilment, even assuming that the people of the\r\ncountry invaded had not withdrawn live stock, vehicles and food supplies\r\non their retirement before the invader.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this provision for the wants of an army in its advance\r\ninto hostile country, the safeguarding of the troops against the risk\r\nof their becoming a band of demoralized marauders, wandering over a\r\nwide area to seek and appropriate food whenever they can find it--as\r\nwas the case, for instance, in the Napoleonic wars--the maintenance of\r\ndiscipline and the continued usefulness of the troops as a concentrated\r\nbody for the military purposes in view being further assured when both\r\nmen and leaders are relieved of anxiety as to the continuance of their\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of war at a great distance from the base by reason of the\r\nfacilities offered for the forwarding alike of troops, reinforcements,\r\nsupplies and military materials, the value of even a single line of\r\nrailway in the achievement of this purpose having been incontestably\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nDefence of frontiers by strategical railways which may, also, become\r\navailable for general use.\r\n\r\nInvestment of cities or fortresses in occupied territory when, owing to\r\nthe lack or the deficiency of food supplies in the surrounding country,\r\nthe troops engaged are mainly if not entirely dependent on those brought\r\nto them by rail from their own base.[79]\r\n\r\nVictualling of cities before, and their revictualling after,\r\ninvestment.[80]\r\n\r\nExtension of lines of communication by means of quickly-constructed\r\nnarrow-gauge siege railways to be operated by motor traction, animal\r\npower, or otherwise, including therein trench tramways for (_a_) removal\r\nof wounded men from the trenches; (_b_) transport of siege guns to\r\ntrenches; and (_c_) supplying ammunition to battery.\r\n\r\nTransport of heavy siege guns, mortars, ammunition and other materials\r\nof a size or weight that would render impracticable their conveyance,\r\nwhether singly or in the aggregate, along ordinary roads, the railway\r\noffering, in this respect, facilities for ponderous transport comparable\r\nto those of the steamship, with the further advantage of being able, in\r\nmost instances, to take the guns, etc., to the spot or to the locality\r\nwhere they are wanted.\r\n\r\nMaterial aid given to expeditions to countries otherwise devoid of means\r\nof communication, by the construction of military railways.\r\n\r\nEmployment of armoured trains which, apart from their usefulness in\r\ndefending railways against attack, may, as movable fortresses, render\r\nimportant service in the operations against the enemy.\r\n\r\nRemoval of sick and wounded from the theatre of war, and the ensuring\r\nof their distribution among hospitals in the rear or throughout the\r\ninterior, thus (_a_) avoiding alike the embarrassment to the army and\r\nthe many dangers and evils that would result from their remaining in\r\novercrowded hospitals on or near the battle-field; (_b_) giving the men\r\na better chance of effecting a speedy recovery and returning soon to\r\nthe ranks; and (_c_) adding to the fighting strength of the army by the\r\ncombination of these two advantages.\r\n\r\nFacilities for giving a short leave to officers and men who, though\r\nneither sick nor wounded, have been so far affected by their strenuous\r\nexertions that they stand in need of a rest, or change, for which they\r\nwill fight all the better subsequently.\r\n\r\nDispatch of prisoners of war into the interior by trains which have\r\nbrought reinforcements or supplies, the army thus being speedily\r\nrelieved of what might otherwise be a hindrance to its operations.\r\n\r\nReturn of material no longer wanted at the front and constituting\r\nimpedimenta of which it is desirable to get rid as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nConveyance into the interior of \"trophies of war\"--including\r\nplunder--taken from captured towns or cities.\r\n\r\nRetirement of troops from occupied territory on the declaration of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.--CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL TO EFFICIENCY\r\n\r\nIn the matter of railway construction there should be--\r\n\r\ni. Uniformity of gauge, together with physical connections between the\r\ndifferent systems or sections, in order (_a_) that the locomotives and\r\nrolling stock on any one line can be used for military transport on\r\nany other; (_b_) that mobilisation, concentration and the forwarding\r\nof supplies and military material can be facilitated by the running of\r\nthrough trains from any probable or possible point of dispatch; and\r\n(_c_) that troops can readily be transferred from one front, or from one\r\npart of the coast, to another for the purpose either of attack or of\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nii. Lines linking up the interior of the country with the frontier, with\r\nthe coast, or with principal ports by different routes, transverse lines\r\nconnecting them, in turn, one with another.\r\n\r\niii. Double track for all lines leading direct to the frontier.\r\n\r\niv. In the case of single-track lines crossing continents or otherwise,\r\na liberal provision of passing places each capable of accommodating the\r\nlongest troop train likely to be run.\r\n\r\nv. On all lines, and at all important stations, a sufficiency of\r\nsidings, with provision of, or the possibility of providing speedily,\r\nall such facilities as may be needed for the prompt and efficient\r\nhandling of military transports whenever the occasion should arise.\r\n\r\nPreparations in advance should include--\r\n\r\ni. The carrying out of a scheme of organisation based on recognition\r\nof the following principles:--(_a_) That, while the railway is an\r\ninstrument capable of rendering great and even incalculable services in\r\nthe conduct of war, the working of it is a highly-skilled business only\r\nto be entrusted to those possessed of the necessary experience; (_b_)\r\nthat interference with such working on the part of military officers\r\nnot possessing the requisite technical knowledge of the details and\r\nlimitations of railway operation may result in chaos and disaster; (_c_)\r\nthat railwaymen, in turn, are not likely to be fully acquainted with the\r\ntechnicalities of military conditions and requirements, and should not,\r\nin any case, be left with the responsibility of having to decide between\r\nthe possibly conflicting demands of various military authorities;\r\n(_d_) that, for these reasons, there should be co-ordination of the\r\nmilitary and the technical railway elements, operating throughout\r\nthe whole scheme of organisation in its manifold details, avoiding\r\nconflict of authority, ensuring harmony of working, and offering the\r\nfullest guarantee that all military requirements will be met so far as\r\nthe capacity of the railway, together with a due regard for safe and\r\nefficient operation, will allow; and (_e_) that effect can best be given\r\nto these various conditions by the appointment of intermediary bodies\r\nwhich, representing the dual elements, shall alone have power to give\r\ndirections, or to make demands, in respect to military rail-transport\r\nduring the continuance of war.\r\n\r\nii. Collection of data concerning the physical character, resources and\r\ntransport capabilities of the railways both in the national territory\r\nand in any other country to which the war operations may extend.\r\n\r\niii. Study of all movements of troops, etc., likely to be necessary\r\non the outbreak of war; the preparation of special time-tables for the\r\nrunning of troop trains, etc., and the working out of all essential\r\ndetails respecting military transport in general.\r\n\r\niv. Creation and training of bodies of Railway Troops qualified to\r\nundertake the construction, destruction, repair and operation of\r\nrailways in time of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.--LIMITATIONS IN USEFULNESS\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of railways in war is limited by the following\r\nconsiderations, among others:--\r\n\r\nRailways are \"inferior to ships in power of simultaneously transporting\r\nheavy loads\" (Von der Goltz). For this reason an overland route to\r\nIndia could never compete, in respect to military transport, with\r\nthe sea route via the Suez Canal. Such overland route, also, passing\r\nthrough foreign countries, would be especially liable to attack and\r\ninterruption. Where, however, the overland route goes entirely through\r\nnational territory (as in the case of the Trans-Siberian Railway), and\r\nwhen the questions of time and safety, in regard to an alternative sea\r\nroute, suggest possible disadvantages, railways will be preferred to\r\nships in spite of the said inferiority.\r\n\r\nRailways are inferior to roads in so far as, like rivers and canals,\r\nthey are on fixed spots. Troops depending on them are thus able to\r\nmove only in the direction in which lines have been or can quickly be\r\nlaid, whereas if they went by road they might have a greater choice of\r\nalternative routes.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the choice of the zone of concentration or of the\r\n\"decisive points\" may depend less to-day on political, military or\r\ngeographical reasons (as in the Napoleonic wars) than on the direction,\r\nextent and capacity of the available railways.\r\n\r\nGreat masses of troops can be entrained only at stations where\r\nfacilities for their so doing have been prepared in advance. The\r\nprovision of these facilities is even more necessary in the case of\r\nCavalry or Artillery than in that of Infantry. Hence the movement of\r\nconsiderable bodies of troops may be restricted to certain lines, and\r\ntheir entrainment or detrainment even to certain large stations. In the\r\ncase of road marching these restrictions would not apply.\r\n\r\nVehicles specially constructed for the purpose can alone be used on\r\nrailways. Any deficiency in their supply must needs cause delay.\r\n\r\nDuring the time the troops are travelling by railway their power of\r\nresisting attack is much more restricted than it would be if they were\r\nmarching by road, they can do little or nothing to protect the railway\r\nlines, while if the enemy can only get to the railway he may be in a\r\nposition to prevent the train from continuing its journey, and take the\r\ntroops in it at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, among others, troop movements by rail at the theatre\r\nof war, and especially in the enemy's country, are attended by a degree\r\nof risk which may render it desirable to abandon the use of the railway\r\nfor the time being.\r\n\r\nRailways are especially liable to destruction by the enemy, and,\r\nalthough the arrangements made in advance may permit of speedy repairs\r\nor reconstruction, the interruption of traffic for even a day or half a\r\nday may be a matter of grave importance during the concentration of the\r\narmy or at some critical moment.\r\n\r\nDestructions of line carried out by a retreating force, in order to\r\ndelay pursuit by the enemy, will be to the disadvantage of that force\r\nwhen, after having driven back the enemy, it would itself make use of\r\nthe line it had rendered unserviceable.\r\n\r\nDependence on the railway for the transport of considerable bodies\r\nof troops on short journeys--say for twenty, twenty-five or thirty\r\nmiles--is rendered inexpedient by the fact that, when allowance is made\r\nfor the time likely to be taken, not only on the journey, but in the\r\nassembling at the station, in the entraining and detraining (perhaps at\r\nsome place devoid of adequate platform or siding accommodation), and in\r\nthe march from the arrival station to destination, it may well be found\r\nthat the troops could cover the distance in less time by road, apart\r\nfrom the consideration, suggested above, as to their being in a better\r\nposition, when marching, to resist attack. Experts in all countries\r\nhave studied this question with a view to deciding, on the basis of\r\ntheir national conditions, within what limit it would be better for\r\ntroops to march by road in preference to going by rail.\r\n\r\nFor reasons akin to those here stated, supplemented by the recent great\r\nexpansion of motor transport, less has been heard of late concerning the\r\nproposed construction in this country of strategical railways along a\r\ncoast-line remarkable for its sinuosities, and presenting, therefore, an\r\nexceptional position from the point of view of coast railways for purely\r\ndefensive purposes.\r\n\r\nAs regards long-distance journeys, whilst armies marching by road have\r\noften been materially reduced in proportions by the number of men\r\nfalling out owing to lameness, exhaustion, or other causes, those who\r\nreached the theatre of war, representing \"the survival of the fittest,\"\r\nwere better able to endure the trials and fatigues of the subsequent\r\ncampaign than if they could have made the journey by rail under\r\nconditions involving no strain, but affording them no such exercise and\r\nstrengthening of their physical powers.[81]\r\n\r\nExperience has further shown that exceptionally long railway journeys\r\nmay have a prejudicial effect upon troops from the point of view, also,\r\nof maintenance of discipline.[82]\r\n\r\nThe services rendered by railways in war relate much more to strategy\r\nthan to tactics. Great masses of troops and munitions, brought from\r\nall parts of the interior, may be conveyed readily and safely by rail\r\nto particular points in the theatre of war; but the possibility of\r\neffecting their transport by rail from one point to another on the\r\nbattle-field when the opposing forces are in actual contact is subject\r\nto many restrictions and constitutes a much more difficult undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe imperative need for guarding a long line of railway communications,\r\nmore especially in occupied territory, may lead to the withdrawal of a\r\nconsiderable number of men from the main army, weakening the strength of\r\nthe available fighting force proportionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nD.--DRAWBACKS AND DISADVANTAGES\r\n\r\nWhile, notwithstanding the conditions to be observed and the limitations\r\nto be experienced, the balance of advantage conferred by railways on the\r\nconduct of war may appear so pronounced, from a military and a political\r\npoint of view, there is a darker side to the story, as regards the world\r\nat large, which must also be taken into account.\r\n\r\nIf railways have increased the power of defending a country against\r\ninvasion they have, also, increased enormously the power of aggression\r\nat the command of an invader.\r\n\r\nThey offer vastly greater facilities to military Powers for the making\r\nof sudden attacks on neighbouring countries--themselves, it may be, in a\r\nstate of more or less unpreparedness.\r\n\r\nThey afford the opportunity for overwhelming weaker Powers by means\r\nof armies mobilised and concentrated in the interior and poured on to\r\nor across the frontier in an endless succession of trains following\r\none another with such rapidity that the initial movement may, in some\r\ninstances, be carried out within the short space of twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThey permit of the prosecution of war at distances which, but for\r\nthe means offered for military transport by rail, would render war\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nThey allow of war being carried on between a number of nations at one\r\nand the same time, thus spreading the area over which the conflicts of\r\nto-day may extend.\r\n\r\nThey encourage the cherishing of designs of world-power and dreams of\r\nuniversal conquest.\r\n\r\nThey have added to the horrors of war by facilitating the transport and\r\nthe employment of the most terrible engines of war.\r\n\r\nThey have rendered possible the carrying off of plunder from an occupied\r\nterritory to an extent which would be impossible if the invaders had to\r\ndepend on ordinary road vehicles for their means of transport.\r\n\r\nThey have brought fresh risks and dangers upon civil populations,\r\nthe maintenance of lines of rail communication being a matter of\r\nsuch paramount importance to an invader that the severest measures\r\nmay be adopted by him towards the community in general as a means of\r\nterrorising them and ensuring the security of the railway lines.\r\n\r\nWhat, in effect, count as \"advantages\" in one direction may be the\r\ngravest of disadvantages in another.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch, for attack or for defence, for good or for evil, is the nature,\r\nand such are the possibilities, of that rail-power in warfare which,\r\nafter eighty years of continuous evolution, was, in the War of the\r\nNations imposed on mankind in 1914, to undergo a development and an\r\napplication on a wider, more impressive, and more terrible scale than\r\nthe world had ever seen before.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[78] Von Moltke is reported to have said on one occasion in the\r\nReichstag: \"Our Great General Staff is so much persuaded of the\r\nadvantages to be derived from obtaining the initiative at the outset\r\nof a war that it prefers to construct railways rather than forts. An\r\nadditional railway, crossing the whole country, makes a difference of\r\ntwo days in the assembling of the army, and advances the operations\r\nproportionately.\" \"In the concentration of armies,\" says von der Goltz\r\nin \"The Conduct of War,\" \"we reckon almost by hours.\"\r\n\r\n[79] \"Without railroads, it is said, the siege of Paris would have been\r\nimpossible\" (Bigelow's \"Principles of Strategy\"). \"During the siege\r\nof Paris one railway for some time fed the [German] army of, in round\r\nnumbers, 200,000 men, brought up the siege materials and reinforcements\r\naveraging 2,000 to 3,000 men a day, and even, at one time, fed Prince\r\nFrederick Charles' army, as well, with very slight assistance from the\r\nexhausted theatre of war\" (Hamley's \"Operations of War\").\r\n\r\n[80] During the thirty-five days preceding the investment, Paris\r\nreceived by the Western Railway, alone, 72,442 tons of provisions and\r\n67,716 head of cattle. But for these supplies she could not have endured\r\nso long a siege. In the revictualling of Paris, after the siege, the\r\nrailways, though much restricted by the Germans, brought into the city,\r\nin the course of twenty days, 155,955 tons of provisions and 42,580 head\r\nof cattle.\r\n\r\n[81] \"The railways spare the troops fatigue,\" remarks Lieut.-Col.\r\nTovey, R.E., in \"The Elements of Strategy\"; \"but it may be that when\r\nthey have to use their legs afterwards there will be more falling out\r\nand lagging behind, in consequence.\" Balck, in his \"Taktik,\" says: \"It\r\nis only in respect to the important consideration as to speed that the\r\nrail-transport of troops is to be preferred to road-marching. The real\r\nadvantages of marching on foot--which was formerly the rule, and had\r\nthe effect of 'separating the chaff from the wheat' and of preparing\r\nthe men for the toils of fighting--are not counterbalanced by the fact\r\nthat the troops arrive at the theatre of war in their full numbers.\r\nWhen time permits, marching on foot is preferable because it accustoms\r\nthe men both to their new equipment and to marching in large bodies.\r\nAfter a long railway journey--on which the feet will have swollen and\r\nthe new boots will have been especially troublesome--marching becomes\r\nparticularly irksome, and the falling out of footsore men is very\r\nconsiderable. It is, nevertheless, the almost invariable rule that the\r\ntroops shall begin their marching immediately they get to the end of\r\nthe rail journey, since it may be a matter of great importance that\r\nthe station at which they detrain should be cleared again as soon as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n[82] In alluding to the conditions under which Russian reinforcements\r\nwere sent to Manchuria during the Russo-Japanese War, General Kuropatkin\r\nwrites (\"The Russian Army and the Japanese War\"): \"In former days troops\r\nhad to make long marches in full service order before they reached the\r\nbattle-field. If properly conducted these marches hardened the men, and\r\nenabled units to settle down; all superfluous luggage was discarded;\r\nthe weaker men were left behind; the officers and men got to know one\r\nanother. But, nowadays, with railway transport, the results are very\r\ndifferent. Going to the Far East, our men were crowded in railway\r\ncarriages for as long as forty days at a time, out of the control of\r\ntheir officers, who were in different compartments. In the old and\r\nwell-disciplined units in particular no harm was done; but in the case\r\nof newly-formed units ... it was most harmful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN FRONTIER RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nOn the north-west frontier of India the plains of the Punjab are\r\nseparated from the great central valley of Afghanistan, from the deserts\r\nof Baluchistan, and from the Russian Empire on the north thereof, by\r\nranges of mountains, otherwise \"a gridiron of stupendous ridges and\r\nfurrows,\" intersected by passes which have always been regarded as the\r\nmost vulnerable points of the Indian Empire. Through these passes from\r\nthe earliest days of recorded history there has come a long succession\r\nof invasions instigated by that incalculable wealth of India which may\r\nwell have inspired the envy of dwellers in less favoured lands.[83]\r\n\r\nThese considerations would alone suffice to establish the need for an\r\neffective control of the more important of the said passes by the Power\r\nwhich exercises supremacy in India; but the obligation thus devolving\r\nupon the British people as the present holders of that supremacy has\r\nbeen increased in recent times by two further factors--(1) troubles\r\nwith frontier tribes; and (2) the development of that Central Asian\r\nQuestion which, though now no longer acute, was, not so many years\r\nago, a source of great anxiety in England and India. Frontier troubles\r\ngave rise to a number of expeditions to Afghanistan from time to time,\r\nwhile the gravity of the general situation was increased by the once\r\nsteady advance of Russia towards India--whether for the purposes of\r\nactual conquest thereof or, alternatively, for the attainment of the aim\r\ncherished by Russia during three centuries for an outlet to a southern\r\nsea, such outlet being sought via the Persian Gulf on her disappointment\r\nin regard to the Dardanelles; though British interests were concerned in\r\neither case.\r\n\r\nThis combination of circumstances, with the possibility, at one\r\ntime, that Afghanistan might become the theatre of war in a conflict\r\nbetween two great European Powers, invested with special interest and\r\nimportance the provision on the north-west frontier of India of railway\r\nlines which, whether constructed to the more important passes or going\r\nactually through them, would form a ready means of concentrating\r\nAnglo-Indian troops at such places on the frontier, or beyond, as\r\noccasion might require.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view the Bolan and Khyber passes--the former leading\r\nto Quetta and Kandahar and the latter to Kabul--have more especially had\r\nimportance attached to them as \"the two gates of India.\"\r\n\r\nProposals for constructing railways through them were advanced as early\r\nas 1857, when Mr. (afterwards Sir) W. P. Andrew, chairman of the Sind,\r\nPunjab and Delhi Railway, acted as spokesman of a deputation which\r\nwaited on Lord Palmerston in order to urge the construction of (1) a\r\nrailway down the valley of the Euphrates, improving our communications\r\nwith India by connecting the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf;\r\nand (2) railways through the Bolan and Khyber passes, not only, as\r\nhe urged, facilitating the movement of troops to the frontier, but\r\noffering alternative routes by means of which the flank or the rear\r\nof an enemy operating beyond or between the limits of the two lines\r\nmight be threatened. Mr. Andrew followed up with great earnestness and\r\nperseverance for many years his advocacy of these views, publishing a\r\nsuccession of books and pamphlets, and writing many letters to the Press\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nSuch advocacy had, however, no practical issue, and, though the\r\narguments originally advanced in favour of the Euphrates railway lost\r\nmost of their force on the opening of the Suez Canal, the consequences\r\nof the neglect to provide better means of communication with the\r\nnorth-west frontier were well manifested in the troubles of 1878-79-80.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the Ameer of Afghanistan--who had already accorded an\r\nostentatious welcome to a Russian Embassy at Kabul--to receive a British\r\nmission led, in 1878, to an order being given for the advance of three\r\ncolumns of British forces upon Afghan territory, the routes selected for\r\nthis purpose being (1) the Khyber Pass, (2) the Kuram Pass, and (3) the\r\nBolan Pass. At this time, however, the system of frontier railways which\r\nhad been advocated so long scarcely existed except on paper. The nearest\r\npoint of railway communication with Afghanistan was then at Sukkur, on\r\nthe Indus. An extension across the Sind desert to the entrance to the\r\nBolan Pass had been surveyed, and a very short section had been laid;\r\nbut in their advance on Kandahar Sir Donald Stewart and his force had to\r\nmarch all the way from the Indus, experiencing great trials in crossing\r\nthe intervening desert, where many of the men lost their lives. The\r\nwork of constructing this desert railway--which presented no engineering\r\ndifficulty--was now taken actively in hand, and the line was available\r\nfor the troops on their return.\r\n\r\nSuccess attended the expedition of 1878 so far as it led to the flight\r\nof Shere Ali, the occupation of Kandahar by Sir Donald Stewart, the\r\ncontrol by the British of the three main highways between India and\r\nAfghanistan, and the signing of the treaty of Gandamak; but the murder\r\nof Sir Louis Cavagnari and his staff at Kabul, in September, 1879,\r\nrendered necessary the sending of a further expedition, General Sir\r\nFrederick (afterwards Lord) Roberts being directed to proceed with a\r\nBritish force by the Kuram route to Kabul.\r\n\r\nThereupon the whole question of transport facilities was revived afresh,\r\nand, although the expedition itself was a conspicuous success, delays\r\nand commissariat difficulties arose which might have been avoided had\r\nbetter railway facilities been available.[84] The terminus, at that\r\ntime, of the Punjab State Railway was at Jhelum, seventy miles from\r\nRawal Pindi, 180 from Peshawar, and 260 from Thal, the frontier post of\r\nthe Kuram pass; and in spite of the vigorous efforts made, between 1878\r\nand 1880, to extend the line, Jhelum remained the actual railway base\r\nthroughout, no material assistance being gained from the twenty miles of\r\nextension which, owing to the great engineering difficulties presented\r\nby innumerable ravines, could alone be carried out during that period.\r\nCommenting on the \"painfully slow\" progress being made by the Khyber\r\ncolumn, _The Times_ of October 13, 1879, remarked:--\r\n\r\n    It is now upwards of a quarter of a century since the\r\n    chairman of the Sind railway commenced to broach the idea\r\n    of connecting the Khyber and Bolan passes with the railway\r\n    system of India. For more than a quarter of a century he\r\n    has unsparingly advocated these views.... Had the views so\r\n    persistently advocated by Mr. Andrew, and so repeatedly brought\r\n    forward by us, been adopted at the commencement of the struggle\r\n    last October, as we then ventured to insist upon, vast sums\r\n    would have been spared in the hire of transport, and we should\r\n    have been spared the ignominy of feeling that a British army,\r\n    nominally on active service, has occupied five weeks in covering\r\n    less than seventy miles.\r\n\r\nRawal Pindi--one of the most important strategical points in India--was\r\nnot reached by the railway until October, 1880, by which time the Afghan\r\nWar of 1878-80 had been brought to a close; and the further extension of\r\nthe Indian railway system to Peshawar,--another position of the utmost\r\nstrategic importance, situate ten miles from the entrance to the Khyber\r\nPass, and 190 from Kabul--was effected by May, 1883.\r\n\r\nFrom a military point of view, however, still greater importance was\r\nattached, at that time, to the securing of rail communication through\r\nthe Bolan Pass to Quetta and Pishin in the direction of Kandahar, this\r\nbeing the route by which, it was thought, the Russians would be certain\r\nto attempt their invasion of India,--if they should undertake one at all.\r\n\r\nSurveys for an extension of the Sukkur-Sibi desert line to Pishin were\r\nmade whilst that line was under construction, and early in 1880 the\r\nGovernment gave directions that the extension was to be proceeded with;\r\nthough they decided that the route to be taken from Sibi should be\r\nthrough the Hurnai Pass in preference to the Bolan route, the former\r\nbeing regarded as preferable for the broad-gauge line (5 ft. 6 in.) with\r\nwhich the \"Kandahar State Railway,\" as it was to be called, would be\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nArrangements were at once made for collecting the necessary materials\r\nand for carrying through the work with the least possible delay; but\r\nfurther progress was checked, in July, 1880, by the disaster at Maiwand.\r\nIn the following October the Gladstone Government, who had succeeded\r\nthe Beaconsfield Administration and had, apparently, resolved upon a\r\ncomplete reversal of the Indian policy of their predecessors, followed\r\nup an earlier announcement of their intention to withdraw from Kandahar\r\nby giving orders for the cessation of the work on the Sind-Pishin\r\nrailway. Maiwand having been avenged, and some refractory tribes\r\nsubdued, Afghanistan was completely evacuated by the British at the end\r\nof April, 1881, and the construction of frontier railways in India was\r\ndropped, for the time being.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of 1883 came a reconsideration of the position. Russia\r\nwas then showing increased activity in the direction of Merv, and\r\nthe British Government concluded, apparently, that they had been too\r\nhasty in ordering the abandonment of the Kandahar State Railway scheme\r\nnearly three years before. So they gave orders that the work should be\r\nresumed; though, in order to render this _volte face_ on their part less\r\nconspicuous, they directed that the undertaking should now be known only\r\nas the \"Hurnai Road Improvement Scheme\"; that it should be proceeded\r\nwith quietly, in order that it might not attract too much attention,\r\nand that the suggestion of a \"road improvement scheme,\" instead of\r\na railway, should be kept up by the engineers not being allowed to\r\nhave even a temporary line of rails for conveying stores, materials\r\nfor bridges, etc., from the base to the passes. This last-mentioned\r\nstipulation meant that the stores and materials had to be either\r\ntransported on the backs of camels or dragged on wheels up stream; and\r\nit was estimated that, in addition to the great loss of time, a sum\r\nof not less than £1,000,000 was wasted in this way before the order\r\nprohibiting the use of temporary rails was rescinded.\r\n\r\nA start was made with the work in October, 1883, and the fact that\r\nthe Russians were then actually approaching Merv, and that a sudden\r\nadvance by them in force was regarded as probable, led to the laying of\r\ngreat emphasis on the need for construction being pushed on with the\r\nutmost vigour. When, in February, 1884, the Russians did occupy Merv,\r\nthe pressure brought to bear on the Engineer-in-chief became still\r\nmore acute. Then, in May, the British Government formally announced\r\nthat, owing to the encroachments of Russia, the line _would_ be built.\r\nThe fiction of a \"Hurnai Road Improvement Scheme\" was now abandoned.\r\nHenceforth the line under construction was to be known as \"The\r\nSind-Pishin State Railway.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the very outset, however, the difficulties which crowded upon\r\nColonel (afterwards Sir James) Browne, R.E., an officer well experienced\r\nin railway and engineering work who was entrusted with the carrying\r\nout of the scheme, were unfavourable to the prospects of speed in\r\nconstruction. The surveys which had already been made were found not\r\nonly worthless but misleading. The first members of his staff were\r\nunacquainted with railway work and had to be succeeded by men brought\r\nfrom England. The plant and materials previously collected, but disposed\r\nof at scrap-iron prices when the line was abandoned in 1880, had now to\r\nbe replaced at an almost fabulous cost, owing to the urgency of the need\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nAll these were, nevertheless, minor troubles as compared with the\r\nphysical conditions to be overcome.\r\n\r\nStarting from an elevation, at Sibi, of 300 ft., the line was to rise\r\n6,200 ft. in the 120 miles between Sibi and the summit level at Kach.\r\n\r\nThen, for the greater part of the 224 miles to which the line was to\r\nextend, the country was a wilderness of rocks and stones--a land of\r\nbarrenness and desolation, where there was no timber, no fuel, scarcely\r\na blade of grass, and, in places, for stretches of several miles, no\r\nwater. It was a land, too, almost devoid of inhabitants, while those\r\nwho did dwell there were described as \"a savage and blood-thirsty race\r\nof robbers,\" continually engaged in plunder and inter-tribal warfare,\r\nand not growing sufficient food even for their own consumption. Almost\r\neverything that was wanted--including supplies for from 15,000 to 30,000\r\nworkers and materials for the line--had to be imported from a distance.\r\n\r\nStill less inviting was this inhospitable region by reason of its range\r\nof climatic conditions. The lowlands have the reputation of being one of\r\nthe hottest corners of the earth's surface. A temperature of 124 deg.\r\nFahr. has been registered in the Nari valley. The highlands, in turn,\r\noffer the alternative of Arctic cold, the temperature there falling in\r\nwinter to 18 deg. below zero. Between the lowlands and the highlands\r\nthere is a temperate zone; but here the constant pestilence was dreaded\r\nno less than the extremes of heat and cold elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs the result of these conditions, the work of construction could be\r\ncarried on in certain districts for part of the year only, and the\r\nworkers had to be transferred from one section of the line to another\r\naccording to the season. Such a movement of front involved the transport\r\nof everything,--stores, tools, offices and some thousands of men. \"The\r\nmanagement of this vast exodus,\" says Captain Scott-Moncrieff, R.E.,\r\nin his paper on \"The Frontier Railways of India,\"[85] \"was a work of\r\nconsiderable anxiety and difficulty. A sudden influx of people, such\r\nas this, into a desolate and barren land naturally caused a famine.\r\nEverything was eaten up, and for some days the question of supplies was\r\nthe burning question of the hour.... Nine hundred camel loads of food\r\nwere consumed daily on the works.\" The customary load for a camel was\r\n400 lbs., but some of the camels carried loads of 800 lbs. up the pass.\r\n\r\nThe engineering difficulties fell into four principal groups,--(1) the\r\nNari Gorge; (2) the Gundakin Defile; (3) the Chuppur Rift, and (4) the\r\nMud Gorge.[86]\r\n\r\nThe Nari Gorge, about fourteen miles in length, beginning just beyond\r\nSibi, has been described as \"one of the most weird tracks through which\r\na railway has ever been carried. The hills, absolutely bare, rise above\r\nthe valley for many thousands of feet in fantastic pinnacles and cliffs.\r\nIt is a scene of the wildest desolation.\" The Nari river, running\r\nthrough the gorge, is formed by a combination of three streams having\r\nbut little water on ordinary occasions, but becoming, in time of flood,\r\na raging torrent which fills up the whole gorge for miles, attains a\r\ndepth of ten feet, and has a velocity of five feet per second. Over\r\nthis river the railway had to be carried in five different places. Not\r\nalone bridges, but heavy embankments, cuttings and tunnels were needed.\r\nAt one point there was an especially dangerous tunnel in which so many\r\naccidents occurred, owing to roof or sides falling in, that at last no\r\nworkmen would enter it except at a wage five-fold that of the high rate\r\nalready being paid. The whole work was liable to be stopped for months\r\ntogether, owing to the washing away of half-completed embankments or\r\nbridges; though until this portion of the line had been completed no\r\nmaterials could be sent to the sections beyond.\r\n\r\nIn the Gundakin Defile, eight miles long, two tunnels had to be made\r\nthrough some most treacherous material, and four bridges had to be\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nThe Chuppur Rift is a chasm three miles long in the spurs of a rocky\r\nmountain forming an apparently insuperable barrier. In time of floods\r\nthe river attains a height of from 30 to 40 ft. The running of the\r\nrailway on a ledge along the side of the mountain being impracticable,\r\nowing to the nature of the rock, the engineers cut a line of continuous\r\ntunnels partly on one side of the rift and partly on the other,\r\nconnecting the two series by an iron girder bridge; but, instead of\r\nconstructing the tunnels in the usual way, from each end--a procedure\r\nwhich would have taken much time--they adopted the expedient of driving\r\nopenings (adits) into the side of the cliff at various points, and then\r\ncutting the tunnel right and left of each of these openings until the\r\nvarious sections met. The only way in which the openings could be made\r\nwas by lowering men down by ropes several hundred feet from the top of\r\nthe cliff until they reached the point where the work for an opening was\r\nto be started. They then drove crowbars into the perpendicular sides of\r\nthe cliff in order to gain the necessary support for a platform from\r\nwhich the blasting operations could be carried on. Six of these openings\r\nwere made on one side of the cliff and six on the other. As a separate\r\ngang of men could operate at each it was possible to complete the whole\r\nwork in the course of a few months. Altogether there is a collective\r\nlength of 6,400 ft. of tunnels in the rift, in addition to a viaduct\r\n75 ft. high, with seven spans of 40 ft. each, and a bridge having an\r\nelevation over the river of 250 ft., and consisting of a central span of\r\n150 ft. and eight spans of 40 ft.\r\n\r\nOn the summit level, twenty-five miles in length, came the five-mile\r\nlong Mud Gorge,--a narrow valley, between precipitous mountains, filled\r\nwith a soil little better than dried mud, and of such a character that\r\nseveral bad slips of road-bed, carrying away the whole of the line,\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nOne would think that with all these difficulties--physical, climatic and\r\nengineering--to face, the constructors of the railway might have been\r\nexcused any more; but there were others besides.\r\n\r\nIn August and September, 1884, the troops and native labourers employed\r\non the work on the lower part of the line were visited by an outbreak\r\nof fever and scurvy of a virulence almost unprecedented in Indian\r\nexperience. Large numbers of the men died. In one gang of 200 the\r\naverage number of deaths was ten a day. Of those who survived the\r\nmajority were so prostrated as to be scarcely capable of doing anything.\r\nSixty per cent. of the Sappers were in hospital.\r\n\r\nFresh troops, to the extent of three Battalions of Pioneers, were\r\nbrought on to the work; but they had scarcely arrived before--in\r\nNovember--there was a severe outbreak of cholera. The Afghans thereupon\r\n\"bolted to a man\"; and they were followed by many skilled artisans who\r\nhad been collected from various parts of India. Additional labour had to\r\nbe obtained from the Eastern Punjab, but much time was lost.\r\n\r\nWhilst the engineers were struggling to overcome these manifold\r\ndifficulties, the political situation was steadily becoming still more\r\nacute. The climax seemed to be reached by the Penj-deh incident of\r\nMarch 30, 1885, when a Russian force under General Komaroff seized this\r\nimportant strategical position, situate near the junction of the Khushk\r\nand Murghab rivers. On April 27, 1885, Mr. Gladstone proposed in the\r\nHouse of Commons a vote of £11,000,000 for the purposes of what then\r\nseemed to be an inevitable war with Russia. The money was voted the same\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nSo the urgency for completing the line which would now, probably, have\r\nbeen available for use had it not been stopped in 1880, was greater\r\nthan ever. Orders were sent to India that the work must be continued\r\nalong all parts of the line regardless of seasons. Within a week or two,\r\nhowever, of the war vote at Westminster, cholera broke out afresh among\r\nthe construction party in India. By the end of May it was spreading\r\namong them \"like a raging fire\"; while to the cholera itself there was\r\nadded a heat so intense that even the most willing of workers found it\r\nalmost unendurable.\r\n\r\nUnder this combination of cholera and excessive heat, work on the lower\r\nsections of the line was stopped altogether for a time--Government\r\norders and Russians notwithstanding. All possible measures were taken to\r\nmitigate the severity of the epidemic; but the death-rate increased with\r\nfrightful rapidity. Some of the best workers, European and Asiatic--men\r\nwho could least be spared, on account of the responsible positions they\r\nheld--were carried off. During the month of June no fewer than 2,000\r\ndied out of 10,000. Of the remainder large numbers sought safety in\r\nflight. Many of the minor Government officials, such as telegraph and\r\nPost Office clerks, went off in a body.\r\n\r\nWhilst sickness and disease had thus been afflicting the camps, fresh\r\ntroubles had arisen in another direction. Early in 1885 the district\r\nwas visited by a succession of floods exceeding in severity anything\r\nknown there for sixty years. In the course of three months the rainfall\r\namounted to 19.27 inches,--a total six times in excess of the average.\r\nSeveral bridges and many miles of temporary roads were washed away;\r\nnumerous accidents were caused; camping grounds were destroyed;\r\ncommunications were interrupted; food supplies became scarcely\r\nobtainable, and great delay resulted in the prosecution of a work for\r\nwhich urgency was being so persistently demanded. The floods did not\r\nfinally subside until the end of May.\r\n\r\nNature having done so much to impede the progress of the undertaking,\r\nit only remained for politicians and officials to do what they could to\r\nfollow her example.\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of the initial prohibition of temporary\r\nlines of rails for the conveyance of stores and materials, and the\r\nloss of time and waste of money involved in the use of camels instead;\r\nbut to this one fact may be added another, namely, that after the\r\nEngineer-in-Chief had made his arrangements to obtain sleepers from the\r\njuniper forests on the north of the line--this being the only timber\r\navailable in the whole district--the Government vetoed the arrangement\r\non the ground that it might, possibly, lead to quarrels among the Afghan\r\ntribes. The timber had to be procured from India, instead. Hence more\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nThen the original arrangement with the Engineer-in-Chief, that the\r\nwork was to be carried out under the Military Department of the Indian\r\nGovernment, and that, in the interests of urgency, he should have a\r\nfree hand, was changed into one which required that the work should\r\nbe controlled by a new member of the Public Works Department, who, it\r\nis alleged, interfered with many of the working details which should\r\nhave been left to an Engineer-in-Chief, and, by his \"unskilled and\r\nunqualified control,\" caused still further delay, together with much\r\nexpense and confusion. A good deal of time was lost, for instance,\r\nbefore Col. Browne could get even some indispensable instruments and\r\nsurvey appliances. Especially persistent, also, was Col. Browne's\r\nimmediate superior in demanding from him \"detailed estimates\" which,\r\non account of the uncertainties of the engineering work and of the\r\nother factors in the situation, it was impossible to prepare whilst the\r\nconstruction of the line was in progress.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, was the energy which had been shown, in spite of all\r\nthese difficulties and drawbacks, that the work was completed within the\r\ntwo years and a half fixed by the Engineer-in-Chief at the start as the\r\nperiod in which--\"with money freely granted\"--it could be done. On March\r\n27, 1887, an engine ran over the line all the way from Sibi to Quetta,\r\nand the Hurnai Railway was formally declared open for traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the apparent certainty of war with Russia, following,\r\nespecially, on her seizure of Penj-deh, had led, in April, 1885, to\r\nan order being given for the construction of a light railway from\r\nSibi through the Bolan Pass to Quetta, as an alternative, more direct\r\nand more quickly constructed route, of which use could be made for\r\na movement of troops to the frontier on the anticipated partial\r\nmobilisation of the Indian Army.\r\n\r\nThe laying of this light railway constituted another notable engineering\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nRunning through the heart of what has been described as \"some of the\r\nboldest mountain scenery in India,\" the Bolan Pass has a length of about\r\nsixty miles and a breadth ranging from one mile to a space, in places,\r\nof only about twenty yards between the rugged mountain walls which here\r\nconvert the pass into a mere defile. The pass is, in fact, practically\r\nthe bed of the Bolan River, and is dry for the greater part of the\r\nyear, but liable to floods. The temporary narrow-gauge line was to be\r\nlaid along the river bed without interfering with the military road\r\nconstructed in 1882-84 as far as Quetta.\r\n\r\nFor the first forty miles there was a fairly good gradient; but beyond\r\nthat came a very heavy rise to the top of the pass; and here, at least,\r\nanything more than a metre-gauge line would have been impracticable.\r\nThe possibility of constructing a line of railway through the pass at\r\nall had long been the despair of engineers, and this was the reason why\r\nthe Hurnai route had been decided on in preference to the Bolan for the\r\nbroad-gauge line to Quetta. Unfortunately, too, the climatic were even\r\ngreater than the engineering difficulties. The heat in the lower parts\r\nof the pass was \"beyond all description,\" and cholera or other diseases\r\ncarried off thousands of the workers.\r\n\r\nWith these two lines at their disposal, the Government were, in the\r\nspring of 1887, quite prepared for a concentration of British and\r\nIndian forces in Afghanistan, had the political condition rendered such\r\na course necessary; but the situation had by then greatly improved,\r\nthanks to the negotiations which had been proceeding with Russia for\r\nthe demarcation of frontiers. In April, 1877, the British and Russian\r\ncommissioners met at St. Petersburg, and, as the result of still further\r\nnegotiations, the questions at issue were settled without the appeal to\r\narms which had at one time appeared inevitable.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 some fifty miles of the Bolan light railway were abandoned in\r\nfavour of another route which, avoiding the first part of the pass,\r\nallowed of a broad-gauge line being laid from Sibi through Quetta\r\nto Bostan Junction, where it connects with what is now known as the\r\nHurnai-Pishin Loop. A branch ninety miles in length, from Quetta to\r\nMushki, on the Seistan trade route, was opened in 1905.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Sind-Pishin railway, with its two sections, via the Bolan\r\nand the Hurnai respectively, has its terminus at New Chaman, on the\r\nactual frontier of Afghanistan, and within seventy miles of Kandahar.\r\nA broad-gauge line throughout, it forms part of the railway system of\r\nIndia, linking up at Ruk junction with the line running thence along the\r\nnorth bank of the Indus to Karachi, and, by means of a bridge across the\r\nIndus, with a line on the south of the river which, in one direction\r\nprovides an alternative route to Karachi, and in the other connects with\r\nCalcutta and other leading cities. The Sind-Pishin line affords, in\r\nfact, a most valuable means for concentrating on the Afghan frontier,\r\nwithin a short distance of Kandahar, and in the shortest possible time a\r\nconsiderable body of troops collected from all parts of India, together\r\nwith reinforcements from Europe, landed at Karachi. As a strategical\r\nline, therefore, the railway is of exceptional importance to India and\r\nto British interests in general; though there can be no suggestion that\r\nit would be used otherwise than for purely defensive purposes.\r\n\r\nThen, in what, since 1901, has constituted the North-West Frontier\r\nProvince of India, there has been a considerable extension of frontier\r\nrailways in recent years,--all serving important strategical purposes.\r\nFrom Peshawar--1,520 miles from Calcutta--there is a broad-gauge\r\nextension, twelve miles in length, to Fort Jamrud, at the mouth of the\r\nKhyber Pass; from Naushahra, a cantonment twenty-seven miles due east\r\nof Peshawar, there is a narrow-gauge line to Dargai, at the foot of\r\nthe Malakand Pass; while among other lines is one to Thal, a military\r\noutpost on the extreme limit of British territory which serves also as a\r\ndepôt for the trade with Northern Afghanistan passing through the Kurram\r\nvalley; and one to Banu, a garrison town, seventy-nine miles south of\r\nKohat, built on a site chosen for political reasons by Sir Herbert\r\nEdwards in 1848.\r\n\r\nA number of other railways on the north-west frontiers of India have\r\nbeen proposed. Whatever may or may not be ultimately done in regard to\r\nthese further schemes, it is obvious that those already constructed have\r\nmade an enormous difference in our strategical position in regard to\r\nAfghanistan and the lands beyond as compared with the military transport\r\nconditions of 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEFENCE OF AUSTRALIA\r\n\r\nWith a total area of 2,948,000 square miles, a population of less than\r\nfour and a half million, and a coast line of 11,300 miles, the continent\r\nof Australia is peculiarly open to attack, and the possibilities of\r\ninvasion, or of attempts at invasion, have not only been much discussed\r\nthere of late years, but they have given rise to schemes of land defence\r\nin which the building of strategical railways and the adapting of\r\nexisting lines to strategical purposes form important factors.\r\n\r\nUnder present conditions Western Australia and the Northern Territory\r\nare isolated from the remaining States of the Commonwealth so far as\r\nregards rail communication, and are at the mercy of any invader who\r\nmight be able to land a force there unchallenged by the British Fleet.\r\n\r\nSince the autumn of 1912, however, there has been under construction a\r\nrailway which, starting from Kalgoorlie, the eastern terminus of the\r\nWestern Australian system, will proceed in a direct line for 1,063 miles\r\nto Port Augusta, on the South Australian system, thus establishing\r\nthrough rail connection between Perth (Western Australia) and the\r\nfarthest limit of the Queensland railway system, a total distance, that\r\nis, of about 4,000 miles. When this, the first of Australia's proposed\r\ntrans-continental lines, is completed, it will be possible to send\r\ntroops from the Central or the Eastern States to Western Australia, not\r\nonly by rail, but by a railway laid so far inland that they will be safe\r\nfrom attack from the sea. There would thus be a reasonable certainty\r\nof the troops arriving at their destination; whereas if they had to\r\ngo by water there might be the risk of the vessels in which they were\r\nmaking the journey being captured by the enemy. While, therefore, the\r\nKalgoorlie-Port Augusta line is expected to serve other than purely\r\nstrategical purposes, it is, in effect, the latter which claim first\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nReferring to the Northern Territory, in an article contributed by him to\r\n_The Empire Review_ for May, 1910, Mr. F. A. W. Gisborne, an authority\r\non Australian questions, wrote:--\r\n\r\n    This vast region embraces 523,620 square miles of land,\r\n    and lies close to Asia, the most populous of the continents.\r\n    At present it contains, exclusive of the aborigines, barely\r\n    one thousand white people and about twice as many Chinese. It\r\n    lacks railway communication with the settled parts of Australia,\r\n    and is completely isolated from them. Its magnificent harbour,\r\n    accessible to the largest vessels afloat, and constituting\r\n    the natural gateway to tropical Australia, lies, save for\r\n    the British Fleet, absolutely defenceless. Behind it extend\r\n    millions of acres of fertile plains never yet tilled, and\r\n    never likely to be cultivated by white hands. Practically no\r\n    industry flourishes in a region which could support myriads of\r\n    agriculturists and operatives.\r\n\r\nThat some of the peoples of crowded Asia may, sooner or later, seek\r\na settlement for their surplus millions on what, for them, would be\r\nso desirable a land as the Northern Territory, with its magnificent\r\nopportunities for those capable of working in a tropical climate, is a\r\ncontingency that has been fully realised in Australia, and the questions\r\nhave arisen (1) as to whether the presence of a thousand whites in a\r\nregion half a million square miles in extent constitutes such \"effective\r\noccupation\" thereof as gives them a right to its exclusive possession;\r\nand (2) whether it would be possible either to prevent Asiatics from\r\ninvading the Northern Territory, if they sought so to do, or to eject\r\nthem therefrom if they did.\r\n\r\nThe latter question raises in an especially interesting form the\r\nproblem as to the respective merits and possibilities of sea-power and\r\nrail-power.\r\n\r\nSea-power would, assuredly, have to be relied upon for safeguarding\r\nthe Northern Territory against invasion, since it would be impossible\r\nfor the Commonwealth Government to station troops at every prospective\r\nlanding point along 1,200 miles of a tropical coast-line in sufficient\r\nforce to keep off any invader who might appear there at some unexpected\r\nmoment. For the checking, therefore, of such invasion, dependence would\r\nhave to be placed on the power of the British Fleet (1) to stop the\r\ninvader, (2) to cut off his connections if he should effect a landing,\r\nor (3) to carry war into the invader's own country.\r\n\r\nNor, if any large Asiatic settlement--as distinct from an \"invasion\" in\r\nthe ordinary acceptation of that term--did take place in the Northern\r\nTerritory under conditions that might not call for the intervention of\r\nthe British Fleet, is it certain that the ejection of the settlers could\r\nbe ensured with the help even of a trans-continental line of railway.\r\nHere the question is not that of the carrying power of a single line\r\nof railway. The examples offered by the War of Secession, the South\r\nAfrican War and the Russo-Japanese War have well established the great\r\nadvantages that even single lines, extending for great distances, can\r\nconfer in the effecting of military transport. The considerations that\r\nwould arise in Australia are, rather, (1) the fact that troops arriving\r\nat Pine Creek or Port Darwin from the south might have to make some\r\nvery long and very trying marches across the 523,000 square miles\r\ncomprising the Northern Territory before they reached the settlement\r\nof the Asiatics whom they were to eject, while they would be dependent\r\nfor their supplies on a far-distant railway base; and (2) the doubt as\r\nto whether Australia could spare a sufficiently large body of troops to\r\nundertake such an expedition, having regard to the defence requirements\r\nof her south-eastern States, the integrity of which would count as of\r\nmore vital importance than an Asiatic settlement in her Far North. So\r\nthere are those who think that if such a settlement were eventually\r\neffected in the Northern Territory, under conditions not constituting a\r\n_casus belli_, Australia would simply have to accept the situation, and\r\nreconcile herself to it as best she could.\r\n\r\nAll these things may seem to reflect on the precise value, from the\r\nrail-power point of view, of that direct communication which, more\r\nespecially for strategical reasons, Australia has hoped eventually to\r\nobtain between north and south as well as between west and east. It\r\nis, nevertheless, desirable to see what has already been done in this\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe construction of a north-to-south trans-continental line, passing\r\nthrough the very centre of the Australian mainland, and linking up\r\nthe Northern Territory with the southern and eastern States, has\r\nbeen under discussion for a period of about forty years. Progress\r\nseemed to be assured by the Acceptance Act of 1910, under which the\r\nGovernment of the Commonwealth, in taking over the Northern Territory\r\nfrom South Australia, agreed to build a trans-continental line\r\nconnecting Oodnadatta, the northern terminus of the South Australian\r\nrailway system, and 688 miles from Adelaide, with Pine Creek, the\r\nsouthern terminus of the Northern Territory system, and 145 miles\r\ndistant from Port Darwin. This connecting link would have a length\r\nof 1,063 miles,--the same, by a singular coincidence, as that of the\r\nKalgoorlie-Port Augusta line.\r\n\r\nSince this \"bargain\" between the South Australia and the Commonwealth\r\nGovernments was made, there have been many advocates of an alternative,\r\nor, otherwise, a supplementary route which, instead of going direct from\r\nSouth Australia to the Northern Territory, (passing through the central\r\nAustralian desert,) would link up--on their west--with the railway\r\nsystems of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, connections with\r\nthe new line being made by these States where necessary. This \"eastern\r\ndeviation route\" would, it is argued, offer a greater strategical\r\nadvantage, as compared with the other route, because if troops had to\r\nbe despatched to the north, they could more readily be supplied from\r\nMelbourne and Sydney--which, between them, contain over one-fourth of\r\nthe entire population of Australia--than from Adelaide; while to send\r\ntroops from Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria to South Australia\r\nin order that they might start on their journey to the Northern\r\nTerritory from Oodnadatta, would involve a material delay under,\r\npossibly, urgent conditions. Thus it is estimated that if the eastern\r\nroute were adopted, troops and travellers from Brisbane to Port Darwin\r\nwould only travel about 2,234 miles as against 3,691 miles via Sydney,\r\nMelbourne, Adelaide and the central Australian route from Oodnadatta.\r\n\r\nHow these rival claims and contentions will be eventually settled\r\nremains to be seen; but there has now been added to them a project for\r\nthe building of other avowedly strategical lines, establishing a more\r\ndirect connection between the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta trans-continental\r\nline, when it is finished, and the capitals of Victoria, New South Wales\r\nand Queensland respectively, facilitating the mutual defence of the\r\neastern, southern and western States in a time of crisis. This further\r\nscheme is, however, designed only to supplement the trans-continental\r\nlines already mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs regards the eastern States and the \"central\" State of South\r\nAustralia, the question of an Asiatic invasion may be assumed not to\r\narise. It has, however, long been regarded as possible that if Great\r\nBritain were at war with some non-Asiatic Power able to challenge her\r\nsupremacy on the seas, the enemy might make an attack, not on the\r\nadmittedly vulnerable Northern Territory--which he would not want\r\neither as a colony for Europeans or as a \"jumping-off\" place from which\r\nto conquer the remainder of Australia--but on some point along the\r\ncoast-line of nearly 2,000 miles which, stretching from Rockhampton,\r\nin Queensland, to Adelaide, in South Australia, comprises (with a\r\nHinterland of some 200 miles) the most populous, the most wealthy and\r\n(for non-Asiatics) the most desirable section of the whole Australian\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Germany--the Power which claims first attention from\r\nthis point of view--has shown far greater desire to convert Africa into\r\na German Empire than she has to effect the annexation of Australia. Yet\r\nthat she has recognized the weakness of the Australian situation is\r\nsuggested by the fact that, in dealing with the defensive power of the\r\nCommonwealth, Dr. Rohrbach, one of the exponents of German World-Policy,\r\nand author of \"Deutschland unter den Weltvölkern,\" among other works,\r\nhas declared that Australia could not resist if her four chief towns,\r\nall of them near the coast, were occupied by an invader.[87]\r\n\r\nWhich of these four towns, or which particular point along the said\r\n2,000 miles of coast-line, an invader would select for his main\r\nattack--apart from feints elsewhere--must needs be uncertain; but this\r\nvery fact only adds to the imperative importance of those responsible\r\nfor the defence of Australia being able to move troops freely, and\r\nwithin the shortest possible period, either from one State to another or\r\nfrom any place to another within one and the same State, as the defence\r\nconditions might require.\r\n\r\nWhen we thus pass on to consider the question as to the use of existing\r\nlines of railway in Australia for strategical purposes, we find that\r\nthe most noteworthy expression of opinion on this branch of the subject\r\nis contained in the following extract from the \"Memorandum\" which Lord\r\nKitchener wrote in 1910, as the result of an investigation made by him,\r\nat the request of the Commonwealth Government, into the \"Defence of\r\nAustralia\":--\r\n\r\n    Railway construction has, while developing the country,\r\n    resulted in lines that would appear to be more favourable to an\r\n    enemy invading Australia than to the defence of the country.\r\n    Different gauges in most of the States isolate each system, and\r\n    the want of systematic interior connection makes the present\r\n    lines running inland of little use for defence, although\r\n    possibly of considerable value to an enemy who would have\r\n    temporary command of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe \"different gauges\" undoubtedly constitute one of the most serious\r\nshortcomings of the existing railways in Australia in regard to those\r\nmilitary movements with which we are here alone concerned.\r\n\r\nStrategical considerations as applied to rail transport require, not\r\nonly that troops shall be readily conveyed, when necessary, from one\r\npart of a country or one part of a continent to another, but that a\r\nmobilisation of the forces shall be followed by a mobilisation of\r\nrailway rolling stock. Locomotives, carriages and trucks on lines which\r\nare not themselves likely to be wanted for military transport should be\r\navailable for use on the lines that will be so wanted, in order that all\r\nthe rolling stock of all the railways in all parts of the country or of\r\nthe States concerned can, at a time of possibly the gravest emergency,\r\nbe concentrated or employed on whatever lines, or in whatever direction,\r\nadditional transport facilities may be needed.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this principle was first recognised by von Moltke;\r\nbut when the railways of Australia were originally planned, each State\r\ntook a more or less parochial view of its own requirements, its own\r\ngeographical conditions, or its own resources, and adopted the gauge\r\nwhich accorded best therewith, regardless of any future need for a\r\nco-ordinated system of rail-transport serving the requirements of the\r\nAustralian continent as a whole.\r\n\r\nSo we find that the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge has been adopted in Queensland,\r\nSouth Australia (with a further 600 miles of 5 ft. 3 in. gauge), Western\r\nAustralia, and the Northern Territory; the 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge (the\r\nstandard gauge in Great Britain and, also, of over 65 per cent. of\r\nthe world's railway mileage,) in New South Wales; and the 5 ft. 3 in.\r\ngauge in Victoria. This means, in most cases, that when the frontier of\r\na State is reached, passengers, mails, baggage and merchandise must\r\nchange or be transferred from the trains on the one system to those of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the west-to-east trans-continental railway (which is\r\nbeing built with the 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge) were now available for use, a\r\ntraveller by it from Perth, Western Australia, through South Australia,\r\nVictoria, New South Wales, and Queensland would require, on account\r\nof the differences in gauge, to change trains at least five times.\r\nThis may be regarded as an extreme case; but the evils of the existing\r\nconditions are presented to us in a concrete form by an estimate which\r\nthe Defence Department of the Commonwealth recently made as to the time\r\nit would take to move a force of 30,000 mounted troops from Melbourne\r\nto Brisbane. It was shown that, with the present break of gauge, this\r\noperation would occupy no less a time than sixty-three days; whereas\r\nif there were no break of gauge twenty-three days would suffice. Thus\r\nthe differences of gauge would mean a loss of forty days in effecting\r\ntransfers at the frontier. In this time much might happen if the enemy\r\nhad obtained temporary control of the sea. Under these conditions, in\r\nfact, he would be able to move his own forces by sea for the still\r\nlonger distance from Adelaide to Brisbane in five days. Brisbane might\r\nthus be captured by the enemy while the reinforcements it wanted were\r\nstill changing trains at the State boundaries.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest here to recall the fact that at one time there\r\nwere still greater differences of gauge on the railways in the\r\nUnited States; that in 1885 the American railway companies resolved\r\nupon establishing uniformity as a means of overcoming the great\r\ninconveniences due to these conditions; and that in 1886, after adequate\r\npreparation, the conversion of practically the entire system of railways\r\nin the United States to the 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge was effected in two\r\ndays. Strategically, therefore, the United States Federal Government\r\ncould now, not only send troops by rail from any one part of their vast\r\nterritory to another, but utilise almost the whole of the available\r\nrolling stock for military purposes.[88]\r\n\r\nUnification of gauge forms, however, a serious proposition for Australia\r\non account of the prodigious outlay which, owing to the short-sighted\r\npolicy of the past, it would now involve.[89]\r\n\r\nThe estimated cost of converting all the 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge in New South\r\nWales and all the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge in Queensland, South Australia,\r\nWestern Australia and the Northern Territory to the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge of\r\nVictoria is no less than £51,659,000. To convert all the 3 ft. 6 in. and\r\n5 ft. 3 in. railways to the 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge of the New South Wales\r\nlines would cost £37,164,000. To convert to the 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge all\r\nthe trunk lines connecting the capitals--and this without shortening the\r\npresent circuitous routes or modifying the heavy grades--would alone\r\ncost about £12,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this still undecided \"battle of the gauges\" there\r\nare in Australia other disadvantages, from a strategical standpoint,\r\nin the existing railway system, included therein being (1) an undue\r\npreponderance of single over double track, so that any exceptional\r\namount of traffic causes a congestion which is likely only to be\r\naggravated by new lines constructed, or extensions made, before the\r\ncarrying capacity of the trunk lines has been increased; and (2) the\r\nbuilding of lines which either lead nowhere or have been expressly\r\nstopped short of the boundaries of a State in order to retain, for the\r\nrailways of that State, traffic from outlying districts which would\r\npass, by a much shorter journey, to the port of a neighbouring State if,\r\nby means of through railway connexion, the residents in the districts\r\nconcerned were free to avail themselves of their geographical advantage\r\nin respect to their nearness to such port.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the efforts she has already made, or is proposing to\r\nmake, to effect such improvement both in her railway system and in\r\nher military transport facilities as may be practicable, Australia\r\nhas sought to provide for that effective organisation without which,\r\nas experience elsewhere has fully shown, great and even disastrous\r\nconfusion may arise at a critical moment owing to conflicts of authority\r\nand other troubles or difficulties in the working of such railways as\r\nmay be utilised for military movements.\r\n\r\nThe action taken in this direction is based on a further recommendation\r\nmade by Lord Kitchener, who, in the course of his Memorandum to the\r\nCommonwealth Government in 1910 said (paragraph 85):--\r\n\r\n    Preparation for mobilisation is primarily the work of\r\n    the General Staff, who recommend the lines to be followed\r\n    and advise where, and in what quantities, the munitions of\r\n    war of the various units should be stored. Concentration can\r\n    only be satisfactorily effected when the railway and military\r\n    authorities are in the closest touch, and work in absolute\r\n    harmony. To secure this co-operation, I advise that a War\r\n    Railway Council be formed, as is the case in the United Kingdom,\r\n    composed of the Chief Railway Commissioner from each State,\r\n    under the presidency of the Quartermaster-General of the Citizen\r\n    Forces, and with an officer of the Headquarters Staff as\r\n    secretary.\r\n\r\nA War Railway Council for the Commonwealth was duly constituted in\r\n1911. The Council, which forms an adjunct of the Commonwealth Defence\r\nDepartment, consists of the Quartermaster-General, (president,) the\r\nsenior officer of the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps also created\r\nfor the railway system alike of the Commonwealth and of each State\r\n(such senior officer being the Chief or the Deputy Commissioner of\r\nRailways); the Consulting Military Engineer of the Commonwealth,\r\nand two representatives of the naval and military forces, with a\r\nmilitary officer as secretary. The duties of the Council in time of\r\npeace are, generally, to furnish advice to the Minister of Defence on\r\nrailway matters, and, particularly (_a_) to determine the method of\r\nsupplying information to, and obtaining it from, the different railway\r\ndepartments; (_b_) to suggest regulations and instructions for carrying\r\nout movement of troops; (_c_) to suggest the method of organising\r\nrailway staff officers in time of war to act as intermediaries between\r\nthe various railway authorities and the troops; (_d_) to consider the\r\nquestion of extra sidings, loading platforms, etc.; and proposals for\r\nunification of gauges; and (_e_) to suggest the organisation and system\r\nof training of railway troops. In time of war the Council further\r\nadvises the Minister of defence on questions of mobilisation. The\r\norganisation for military rail-transport in the several States follows\r\non the lines of the system already adopted in the United Kingdom, as\r\nlaid down in the Field Service Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[83] Altogether there have been twenty-six invasions of India, dating\r\nback to about 2,000 years B.C., and of this number no fewer than\r\ntwenty-one have ended in conquest.\r\n\r\n[84] It has been stated that the number of camels employed during the\r\nexpeditions of 1878-80 for transport purposes, in default of better\r\nrail communication, was so great as almost to exhaust the supply of\r\nthe frontier provinces of Sind and Punjab, while from 30,000 to 40,000\r\nof them died owing to the excessive toils and trials of the work they\r\nwere required to perform, the financial loss resulting therefrom to the\r\nTreasury being estimated at £200,000.\r\n\r\n[85] \"Professional Papers of the Corps of Royal Engineers,\" Vol xi, 1885.\r\n\r\n[86] \"Life and Times of General Sir James Browne, R.E., K.C.B.,\r\nK.C.S.I.\" by General J.
