Sincere apologies to Greek scholars! Longer\r\npassages in Greek have been omitted and where possible replaced with a\r\nreference to the original from which they were taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nIt is an honourable characteristic of the Spirit of this Age, that\r\nprojects of violence and warfare are regarded among civilized states\r\nwith gradually increasing aversion. The Universal Peace Society\r\ncertainly does not, and probably never will, enrol the majority of\r\nstatesmen among its members. But even those who look upon the Appeal\r\nof Battle as occasionally unavoidable in international controversies,\r\nconcur in thinking it a deplorable necessity, only to be resorted to\r\nwhen all peaceful modes of arrangement have been vainly tried; and when\r\nthe law of self-defence justifies a State, like an individual, in using\r\nforce to protect itself from imminent and serious injury. For a writer,\r\ntherefore, of the present day to choose battles for his favourite topic,\r\nmerely because they were battles, merely because so many myriads of\r\ntroops were arrayed in them, and so many hundreds or thousands of human\r\nbeings stabbed, hewed, or shot each other to death during them, would\r\nargue strange weakness or depravity of mind. Yet it cannot be denied\r\nthat a fearful and wonderful interest is attached to these scenes of\r\ncarnage. There is undeniable greatness in the disciplined courage, and\r\nin the love of honour, which make the combatants confront agony and\r\ndestruction. And the powers of the human intellect are rarely more\r\nstrongly displayed than they are in the Commander, who regulates,\r\narrays, and wields at his will these masses of armed disputants; who,\r\ncool yet daring, in the midst of peril reflects on all, and provides for\r\nall, ever ready with fresh resources and designs, as the vicissitudes of\r\nthe storm of slaughter require. But these qualities, however high they\r\nmay appear, are to be found in the basest as well as in the noblest of\r\nmankind. Catiline was as brave a soldier as Leonidas, and a much better\r\nofficer. Alva surpassed the Prince of Orange in the field; and Suwarrow\r\nwas the military superior of Kosciusko. To adopt the emphatic words of\r\nByron:--\r\n\r\n     \"'Tis the Cause makes all,\r\n      Degrades or hallows courage in its fall.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some battles, also, which claim our attention, independently\r\nof the moral worth of the combatants, on account of their enduring\r\nimportance, and by reason of the practical influence on our own social\r\nand political condition, which we can trace up to the results of those\r\nengagements. They have for us an abiding and actual interest, both\r\nwhile we investigate the chain of causes and effects, by which they have\r\nhelped to make us what we are; and also while we speculate on what we\r\nprobably should have been, if any one of those battles had come to\r\na different termination. Hallam has admirably expressed this in his\r\nremarks on the victory gained by Charles Martel, between Tours and\r\nPoictiers, over the invading Saracens.\r\n\r\nHe says of it, that \"it may justly be reckoned among those few battles\r\nof which a contrary event would have essentially varied the drama of the\r\nworld in all its subsequent scenes: with Marathon, Arbela, the Metaurus,\r\nChalons, and Leipsic.\" It was the perusal of this note of Hallam's that\r\nfirst led me to the consideration of my present subject. I certainly\r\ndiffer from that great historian as to the comparative importance of\r\nsome of the battles which he thus enumerates, and also of some which he\r\nomits. It is probable, indeed, that no two historical inquirers would\r\nentirely agree in their lists of the Decisive Battles of the World.\r\nDifferent minds will naturally vary in the impressions which particular\r\nevents make on them; and in the degree of interest with which they\r\nwatch the career, and reflect on the importance, of different historical\r\npersonages. But our concurrence in our catalogues is of little moment,\r\nprovided we learn to look on these great historical events in the spirit\r\nwhich Hallam's observations indicate. Those remarks should teach us\r\nto watch how the interests of many states are often involved in the\r\ncollisions between a few; and how the effect of those collisions is not\r\nlimited to a single age, but may give an impulse which will sway the\r\nfortunes of successive generations of mankind. Most valuable also is the\r\nmental discipline which is thus acquired, and by which we are trained\r\nnot only to observe what has been, and what is, but also to ponder on\r\nwhat might have been. [See Bolingbroke, On the Study and Use of History,\r\nvol. ii. p. 497 of his collected works.]\r\n\r\nWe thus learn not to judge of the wisdom of measures too exclusively by\r\nthe results. We learn to apply the juster standard of seeing what the\r\ncircumstances and the probabilities were that surrounded a statesman or\r\na general at the time when he decided on his plan: we value him not by\r\nhis fortune, but by his PROAIRESIZ, to adopt the expressive Greek word,\r\nfor which our language gives no equivalent.\r\n\r\nThe reasons why each of the following Fifteen Battles has been selected\r\nwill, I trust, appear when it is described. But it may be well to\r\npremise a few remarks on the negative tests which have led me to\r\nreject others, which at first sight may appear equal in magnitude and\r\nimportance to the chosen Fifteen.\r\n\r\nI need hardly remark that it is not the number of killed and wounded in\r\na battle that determines its general historical importance. It is not\r\nbecause only a few hundreds fell in the battle by which Joan of Arc\r\ncaptured the Tourelles and raised the siege of Orleans, that the effect\r\nof that crisis is to be judged: nor would a full belief in the largest\r\nnumber which Eastern historians state to have been slaughtered in any\r\nof the numerous conflicts between Asiatic rulers, make me regard the\r\nengagement in which they fell as one of paramount importance to mankind.\r\nBut, besides battles of this kind, there are many of great consequence,\r\nand attended with circumstances which powerfully excite our feelings,\r\nand rivet our attention, and yet which appear to me of mere secondary\r\nrank, inasmuch as either their effects were limited in area, or they\r\nthemselves merely confirmed some great tendency or bias which an earlier\r\nbattle had originated. For example, the encounters between the Greeks\r\nand Persians, which followed Marathon, seem to me not to have been\r\nphenomena of primary impulse. Greek superiority had been already\r\nasserted, Asiatic ambition had already been checked, before Salamis and\r\nPlatea confirmed the superiority of European free states over Oriental\r\ndespotism. So, AEgos-Potamos, which finally crushed the maritime\r\npower of Athens, seems to me inferior in interest to the defeat before\r\nSyracuse, where Athens received her first fatal check, and after which\r\nshe only struggled to retard her downfall. I think similarly of Zama\r\nwith respect to Carthage, as compared with the Metaurus: and, on the\r\nsame principle, the subsequent great battles of the Revolutionary\r\nwar appear to me inferior in their importance to Valmy, which first\r\ndetermined the military character and career of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nI am aware that a little activity of imagination, and a slight exercise\r\nof metaphysical ingenuity, may amuse us, by showing how the chain of\r\ncircumstances is so linked together, that the smallest skirmish, or the\r\nslightest occurrence of any kind, that ever occurred, may be said to\r\nhave been essential, in its actual termination, to the whole order of\r\nsubsequent events. But when I speak of Causes and Effects, I speak of\r\nthe obvious and important agency of one fact upon another, and not of\r\nremote and fancifully infinitesimal influences. I am aware that, on the\r\nother hand, the reproach of Fatalism is justly incurred by those,\r\nwho, like the writers of a certain school in a neighbouring country,\r\nrecognise in history nothing more than a series of necessary phenomena,\r\nwhich follow inevitably one upon the other. But when, in this work,\r\nI speak of probabilities, I speak of human probabilities only. When I\r\nspeak of Cause and Effect, I speak of those general laws only, by which\r\nwe perceive the sequence of human affairs to be usually regulated; and\r\nin which we recognise emphatically the wisdom and power of the Supreme\r\nLawgiver, the design of The Designer.\r\n\r\nMITRE COURT CHAMBERS, TEMPLE, June 26, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

The\r\nimmediate subject of their meeting was to consider whether they should\r\ngive battle to an enemy that lay encamped on the shore beneath them; but\r\non the result of their deliberations depended not merely the fate of two\r\narmies, but the whole future progress of human civilization.\r\n\r\nThere were eleven members of that council of war. Ten were the generals,\r\nwho were then annually elected at Athens, one for each of the local\r\ntribes into which the Athenians were divided. Each general led the men\r\nof his own tribe, and each was invested with equal military authority.\r\nOne also of the Archons was associated with them in the joint command\r\nof the collective force. This magistrate was termed the Polemarch or\r\nWar-Ruler: he had the privilege of leading the right wing of the army\r\nin battle, and of taking part in all councils of war. A noble Athenian,\r\nnamed Callimachus, was the War-Ruler of this year; and as such, stood\r\nlistening to the earnest discussion of the ten generals. They had,\r\nindeed, deep matter for anxiety, though little aware how momentous to\r\nmankind were the votes they were about to give, or how the generations\r\nto come would read with interest that record of their debate. They saw\r\nbefore them the invading forces of a mighty empire, which had in the\r\nlast fifty years shattered and enslaved nearly all the kingdoms and\r\nprincipalities of the then known world. They knew that all the resources\r\nof their own country were comprised in the little army entrusted to\r\ntheir guidance. They saw before them a chosen host of the Great King\r\nsent to wreak his special wrath on that country, and on the other\r\ninsolent little Greek community, which had dared to aid his rebels\r\nand burn the capital of one of his provinces. That victorious host\r\nhad already fulfilled half its mission of vengeance. Eretria, the\r\nconfederate of Athens in the bold march against Sardis nine years\r\nbefore, had fallen in the last few days; and the Athenian generals could\r\ndiscern from the heights the island of AEgilia, in which the Persians\r\nhad deposited their Eretrian prisoners, whom they had reserved to be led\r\naway captives into Upper Asia, there to hear their doom from the lips of\r\nKing Darius himself. Moreover, the men of Athens knew that in the camp\r\nbefore them was their own banished tyrant, Hippias, who was seeking to\r\nbe reinstated by foreign scimitars in despotic sway over any remnant of\r\nhis countrymen that might survive the sack of their town, and might be\r\nleft behind as too worthless for leading away into Median bondage.\r\n\r\nThe numerical disparity between the force which the Athenian commanders\r\nhad under them, and that which they were called on to encounter, was\r\nfearfully apparent to some of the council. The historians who wrote\r\nnearest to the time of the battle do not pretend to give any detailed\r\nstatements of the numbers engaged, but there are sufficient data for\r\nour making a general estimate. Every free Greek was trained to military\r\nduty: and, from the incessant border wars between the different states,\r\nfew Greeks reached the age of manhood without having seen some service.\r\nBut the muster-roll of free Athenian citizens of an age fit for military\r\nduty never exceeded thirty thousand, and at this epoch probably did not\r\namount to two-thirds of that number. Moreover, the poorer portion\r\nof these were unprovided with the equipments, and untrained to the\r\noperations of the regular infantry. Some detachments of the best armed\r\ntroops would be required to garrison the city itself, and man the\r\nvarious fortified posts in the territory; so that it is impossible to\r\nreckon the fully equipped force that marched from Athens to Marathon,\r\nwhen the news of the Persian landing arrived, at higher than ten\r\nthousand men. [The historians who lived long after the time of the\r\nbattle, such as Justin, Plutarch and others, give ten thousand as the\r\nnumber of the Athenian army. Not much reliance could be placed on their\r\nauthority, if unsupported by other evidence; but a calculation made from\r\nthe number of the Athenian free population remarkably confirms it. For\r\nthe data of this, see Boeck's \"Public Economy of Athens,\" vol. i. p. 45.\r\nSome METOIKOI probably served as Hoplites at Marathon, but the number of\r\nresident aliens at Athens cannot have been large at this period.]\r\n\r\nWith one exception, the other Greeks held back from aiding them. Sparta\r\nhad promised assistance; but the Persians had landed on the sixth day\r\nof the moon, and a religious scruple delayed the march of Spartan troops\r\ntill the moon should have reached its full. From one quarter only, and\r\nthat a most unexpected one, did Athens receive aid at the moment of her\r\ngreat peril.\r\n\r\nFor some years before this time, the little state of Plataea in Boeotia,\r\nbeing hard pressed by her powerful neighbour, Thebes, had asked the\r\nprotection of Athens, and had owed to an Athenian army the rescue of her\r\nindependence. Now when it was noised over Greece that the Mede had\r\ncome from the uttermost parts of the earth to destroy Athens, the brave\r\nPlataeans, unsolicited, marched with their whole force to assist in the\r\ndefence, and to share the fortunes of their benefactors. The general\r\nlevy of the Plataeans only amounted to a thousand men: and this little\r\ncolumn, marching from their city along the southern ridge of Mount\r\nCithaeron, and thence across the Attic territory, joined the Athenian\r\nforces above Marathon almost immediately before the battle. The\r\nreinforcement was numerically small; but the gallant spirit of the men\r\nwho composed it must have made it of tenfold value to the Athenians: and\r\nits presence must have gone far to dispel the cheerless feeling of being\r\ndeserted and friendless, which the delay of the Spartan succours was\r\ncalculated to create among the Athenian ranks.\r\n\r\nThis generous daring of their weak but true-hearted ally was never\r\nforgotten at Athens. The Plataeans were made the fellow-countrymen\r\nof the Athenians, except the right of exercising certain political\r\nfunctions; and from that time forth in the solemn sacrifices at Athens,\r\nthe public prayers were offered up for a joint blessing from Heaven upon\r\nthe Athenians, and the Plataeans also. [Mr. Grote observes (vol. iv. p.\r\n484), that \"this volunteer march of the whole Plataean force to Marathon\r\nis one of the most affecting incidents of all Grecian history.\" In\r\ntruth, the whole career of Plataea, and the friendship, strong even unto\r\ndeath, between her and Athens, form one of the most affecting episodes\r\nin the history of antiquity. In the Peloponnesian War the Plataeans\r\nagain were true to the Athenians against all risks and all calculation\r\nof self-interest; and the destruction of Plataea was the consequence.\r\nThere are few nobler passages in the classics than the speech in which\r\nthe Plataean prisoners of war, after the memorable siege of their city,\r\njustify before their Spartan executioners their loyal adherence to\r\nAthens. (See Thucydides, lib. iii. secs. 53-60.)]\r\n\r\nAfter the junction of the column from Plataea, the Athenians commanders\r\nmust have had under them about eleven thousand fully-armed and\r\ndisciplined infantry, and probably a larger number of irregular\r\nlight-armed troops; as, besides the poorer citizens who went to\r\nthe field armed with javelins, cutlasses, and targets, each regular\r\nheavy-armed soldier was attended in the camp by one or more slaves, who\r\nwere armed like the inferior freemen. [At the battle of Plataea, eleven\r\nyears after Marathon, each of the eight thousand Athenian regular\r\ninfantry who served there, was attended by a light-armed slave. (Herod.\r\nlib. viii. c. 28,29.)] Cavalry or archers the Athenians (on this\r\noccasion) had none: and the use in the field of military engines was not\r\nat that period introduced into ancient warfare.\r\n\r\nContrasted with their own scanty forces, the Greek commanders saw\r\nstretched before them, along the shores of the winding bay, the tents\r\nand shipping of the varied nations that marched to do the bidding of the\r\nKing of the Eastern world. The difficulty of finding transports and\r\nof securing provisions would form the only limit to the numbers of a\r\nPersian army. Nor is there any reason to suppose the estimate of Justin\r\nexaggerated, who rates at a hundred thousand the force which on this\r\noccasion had sailed, under the satraps Datis and Artaphernes, from the\r\nCilician shores, against the devoted coasts of Euboea and Attica.\r\nAnd after largely deducting from this total, so as to allow for mere\r\nmariners and camp followers, there must still have remained fearful odds\r\nagainst the national levies of the Athenians. Nor could Greek generals\r\nthen feel that confidence in the superior quality of their troops which\r\never since the battle of Marathon has animated Europeans in conflicts\r\nwith Asiatics; as, for instance, in the after struggles between Greece\r\nand Persia, or when the Roman legions encountered the myriads of\r\nMithridates and Tigranes, or as is the case in the Indian campaigns of\r\nour own regiments. On the contrary, up to the day of Marathon the Medes\r\nand Persians were reputed invincible. They had more than once met Greek\r\ntroops in Asia Minor, in Cyprus, in Egypt, and had invariably beaten\r\nthem. Nothing can be stronger than the expressions used by the early\r\nCreek writers respecting the terror which the name of the Medes\r\ninspired, and the prostration of men's spirits before the apparently\r\nresistless career of the Persian arms. It is therefore, little to be\r\nwondered at, that five of the ten Athenian generals shrank from the\r\nprospect of fighting a pitched battle against an enemy so superior in\r\nnumbers, and so formidable in military renown. Their own position on the\r\nheights was strong, and offered great advantages to a small defending\r\nforce against assailing masses. They deemed it mere foolhardiness\r\nto descend into the plain to be trampled down by the Asiatic horse,\r\noverwhelmed with the archery, or cut to pieces by the invincible\r\nveterans of Cambyses and Cyrus. Moreover, Sparta, the great war-state of\r\nGreece, had been applied to, and had promised succour to Athens, though\r\nthe religious observance which the Dorians paid to certain times and\r\nseasons had for the present delayed their march. Was it not wise, at\r\nany rate, to wait till the Spartans came up, and to have the help of the\r\nbest troops in Greece, before they exposed themselves to the shock of\r\nthe dreaded Medes?\r\n\r\nSpecious as these reasons might appear, the other five generals were for\r\nspeedier and bolder operations. And, fortunately for Athens and for the\r\nworld, one of them was a man, not only of the highest military genius,\r\nbut also of that energetic character which impresses its own type and\r\nideas upon spirits feebler in conception.\r\n\r\nMiltiades was the head of one of the noblest houses at Athens: he ranked\r\nthe AEacidae among his ancestry, and the blood of Achilles flowed in\r\nthe veins of the hero of Marathon. One of his immediate ancestors had\r\nacquired the dominion of the Thracian Chersonese, and thus the family\r\nbecame at the same time Athenian citizens and Thracian princes. This\r\noccurred at the time when Pisistratus was tyrant of Athens. Two of the\r\nrelatives of Miltiades--an uncle of the same name, and a brother named\r\nStesagoras--had ruled the Chersonese before Miltiades became its prince.\r\nHe had been brought up at Athens in the house of his father Cimon,\r\n[Herodotus, lib. vi. c. 102] who was renowned throughout Greece for his\r\nvictories in the Olympic chariot-races, and who must have been possessed\r\nof great wealth. The sons of Pisistratus, who succeeded their father in\r\nthe tyranny at Athens, caused Cimon to be assassinated, but they treated\r\nthe young Miltiades with favour and kindness; and when his brother\r\nStesagoras died in the Chersonese, they sent him out there as lord of\r\nthe principality. This was about twenty-eight years before the battle\r\nof Marathon, and it is with his arrival in the Chersonese that our first\r\nknowledge of the career and character of Miltiades commences. We\r\nfind, in the first act recorded of him, proof of the same resolute and\r\nunscrupulous spirit that marked his mature age. His brother's authority\r\nin the principality had been shaken by war and revolt: Miltiades\r\ndetermined to rule more securely. On his arrival he kept close within\r\nhis house, as if he was mourning for his brother. The principal men\r\nof the Chersonese, hearing of this, assembled from all the towns and\r\ndistricts, and went together to the house of Miltiades on a visit of\r\ncondolence. As soon as he had thus got them in his power, he made\r\nthem all prisoners. He then asserted and maintained his own absolute\r\nauthority in the peninsula, taking into his pay a body of five hundred\r\nregular troops, and strengthening his interest by marrying the daughter\r\nof the king of the neighbouring Thracians.\r\n\r\nWhen the Persian power was extended to the Hellespont and its\r\nneighbourhood, Miltiades, as prince of the Chersonese, submitted to King\r\nDarius; and he was one of the numerous tributary rulers who led their\r\ncontingents of men to serve in the Persian army in the expedition\r\nagainst Scythia. Miltiades and the vassal Greeks of Asia Minor were left\r\nby the Persian king in charge of the bridge across the Danube, when\r\nthe invading army crossed that river, and plunged into the wilds of\r\nthe country that now is Russia, in vain pursuit of the ancestors of the\r\nmodern Cossacks. On learning the reverses that Darius met with in the\r\nScythian wilderness, Miltiades proposed to his companions that they\r\nshould break the bridge down, and leave the Persian king and his army\r\nto perish by famine and the Scythian arrows. The rulers of the Asiatic\r\nGreek cities whom Miltiades addressed, shrank from this bold and\r\nruthless stroke against the Persian power, and Darius returned in\r\nsafety. But it was known what advice Miltiades had given; and the\r\nvengeance of Darius was thenceforth specially directed against the man\r\nwho had counselled such a deadly blow against his empire and his person.\r\nThe occupation of the Persian arms in other quarters left Miltiades\r\nfor some years after this in possession of the Chersonese; but it\r\nwas precarious and interrupted. He, however, availed himself of the\r\nopportunity which his position gave him of conciliating the goodwill\r\nof his fellow-countrymen at Athens, by conquering and placing under\r\nAthenian authority the islands of Lemnos and Imbros, to which Athens had\r\nancient claims, but which she had never previously been able to\r\nbring into complete subjection. At length, in 494 B.C., the complete\r\nsuppression of the Ionian revolt by the Persians left their armies and\r\nfleets at liberty to act against the enemies of the Great King to the\r\nwest of the Hellespont. A strong squadron of Phoenician galleys was sent\r\nagainst the Chersonese. Miltiades knew that resistance was hopeless; and\r\nwhile the Phoenicians were at Tenedos, he loaded five galleys with all\r\nthe treasure that he could collect, and sailed away for Athens. The\r\nPhoenicians fell in with him, and chased him hard along the north of\r\nthe AEgean. One of his galleys, on board of which was his eldest son,\r\nMetiochus, was actually captured; but Miltiades, with the other four,\r\nsucceeded in reaching the friendly coast of Imbros in safety. Thence\r\nhe afterwards proceeded to Athens, and resumed his station as a free\r\ncitizen of the Athenian commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians at this time had recently expelled Hippias, the son of\r\nPisistratus, the last of their tyrants. They were in the full glow\r\nof their newly-recovered liberty and equality; and the constitutional\r\nchanges of Cleisthenes had inflamed their republican zeal to the utmost.\r\nMiltiades had enemies at Athens; and these, availing themselves of the\r\nstate of popular feeling, brought him to trial for his life for having\r\nbeen tyrant of the Chersonese. The charge did not necessarily import any\r\nacts of cruelty or wrong to individuals: it was founded on so specific\r\nlaw; but it was based on the horror with which the Greeks of that age\r\nregarded every man who made himself compulsory master of his fellow-men,\r\nand exercised irresponsible dominion over them. The fact of Miltiades\r\nhaving so ruled in the Chersonese was undeniable; but the question which\r\nthe Athenians, assembled in judgment, must have tried, was, whether\r\nMiltiades, by becoming tyrant of the Chersonese, deserved punishment as\r\nan Athenian citizen. The eminent service that he had done the state in\r\nconquering Lemnos and Imbros for it, pleaded strongly in his favour. The\r\npeople refused to convict him. He stood high in public opinion; and when\r\nthe coming invasion of the Persians was known, the people wisely elected\r\nhim one of their generals for the year.\r\n\r\nTwo other men of signal eminence in history, though their renown was\r\nachieved at a later period than that of Miltiades, were also among the\r\nten Athenian generals at Marathon. One was Themistocles, the future\r\nfounder of the Athenian navy and the destined victor of Salamis: the\r\nother was Aristides, who afterwards led the Athenian troops at Plataea,\r\nand whose integrity and just popularity acquired for his country, when\r\nthe Persians had finally been repulsed, the advantageous pre-eminence of\r\nbeing acknowledged by half of the Greeks as their impartial leader and\r\nprotector. It is not recorded what part either Themistocles or Aristides\r\ntook in the debate of the council of war at Marathon. But from the\r\ncharacter of Themistocles, his boldness, and his intuitive genius for\r\nextemporizing the best measures in every emergency (a quality which the\r\ngreatest of historians ascribes to him beyond all his contemporaries),\r\nwe may well believe that the vote of Themistocles was for prompt and\r\ndecisive action. [See the character of Themistocles in the 138th section\r\nof the first book of Thucydides, especially the last sentence.] On\r\nthe vote of Aristides it may be more difficult to speculate. His\r\npredilection for the Spartans may have made him wish to wait till they\r\ncame up; but, though circumspect, he was neither timid as a soldier\r\nnor as a politician; and the bold advice of Miltiades may probably have\r\nfound in Aristides a willing, most assuredly it found in him a candid,\r\nhearer.\r\n\r\nMiltiades felt no hesitation as to the course which the Athenian\r\narmy ought to pursue: and earnestly did he press his opinion on his\r\nbrother-generals. Practically acquainted with the organization of the\r\nPersian armies, Miltiades was convinced of the superiority of the Greek\r\ntroops, if properly handled: he saw with the military eye of a great\r\ngeneral the advantage which the position of the forces gave him for\r\na sudden attack, and as a profound politician he felt the perils of\r\nremaining inactive, and of giving treachery time to ruin the Athenian\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nOne officer in the council of war had not yet voted. This was\r\nCallimachus, the War-Ruler. The votes of the generals were five and\r\nfive, so that the voice of Callimachus would be decisive.\r\n\r\nOn that vote, in all human probability, the destiny of all the nations\r\nof the world depended. Miltiades turned to him, and in simple soldierly\r\neloquence, the substance of which we may read faithfully reported in\r\nHerodotus, who had conversed with the veterans of Marathon, the great\r\nAthenian thus adjured his countryman to vote for giving battle:--\r\n\r\n\"It now rests with you, Callimachus, either to enslave Athens, or, by\r\nassuring her freedom, to win yourself an immortality of fame, such as\r\nnot even Harmodius and Aristogeiton have acquired. For never, since the\r\nAthenians were a people, were they in such danger as they are in at this\r\nmoment. If they bow the knee to these Medes, they are to be given up to\r\nHippias, and you know what they then will have to suffer. But if Athens\r\ncomes victorious out of this contest, she has it in her to become the\r\nfirst city of Greece. Your vote is to decide whether we are to join\r\nbattle or not. If we do not bring on a battle presently, some factious\r\nintrigue will disunite the Athenians, and the city will be betrayed to\r\nthe Medes. But if we fight, before there is anything rotten in the state\r\nof Athens, I believe that, provided the Gods will give fair play and\r\nno favour, we are able to get the best of it in the engagement.\"\r\n[Herodotus, lib. vi. sec. 209. The 116th section is to my mind clear\r\nproof that Herodotus had personally conversed with Epizelus, one of the\r\nveterans of Marathon. The substance of the speech of Miltiades would\r\nnaturally become known by the report of some of his colleagues.]\r\n\r\nThe vote of the brave War-Ruler was gained; the council determined\r\nto give battle; and such was the ascendancy and military eminence of\r\nMiltiades, that his brother-generals, one and all, gave up their days of\r\ncommand to him, and cheerfully acted under his orders. Fearful, however,\r\nof creating any jealousy, and of so failing to obtain the co-operation\r\nof all parts of his small army, Miltiades waited till the day when the\r\nchief command would have come round to him in regular rotation, before\r\nhe led the troops against the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe inaction of the Asiatic commanders, during this interval, appears\r\nstrange at first sight; but Hippias was with them, and they and he were\r\naware of their chance of a bloodless conquest through the machinations\r\nof his partisans among the Athenians. The nature of the ground also\r\nexplains, in many points, the tactics of the opposite generals\r\nbefore the battle, as well as the operations of the troops during the\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nThe plain of Marathon, which is about twenty-two miles distant from\r\nAthens, lies along the bay of the same name on the north-eastern coast\r\nof Attica. The plain is nearly in the form of a crescent, and about six\r\nmiles in length. It is about two miles broad in the centre, where the\r\nspace between the mountains and the sea is greatest, but it narrows\r\ntowards either extremity, the mountains coming close down to the water\r\nat the horns of the bay. There is a valley trending inwards from the\r\nmiddle of the plain, and a ravine comes down to it to the southward.\r\nElsewhere it, is closely girt round on the land side by rugged limestone\r\nmountains, which are thickly studded with pines, olive-trees, and\r\ncedars, and overgrown with the myrtle, arbutus, and the other low\r\nodoriferous shrubs that everywhere perfume the Attic air. The level of\r\nthe ground is now varied by the mound raised over those who fell in the\r\nbattle, but it was an unbroken plain when the Persians encamped on it.\r\nThere are marshes at each end, which are dry in spring and summer, and\r\nthen offer no obstruction to the horseman, but are commonly flooded with\r\nrain, and so rendered impracticable for cavalry, in the autumn, the time\r\nof year at which the action took place.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, lying encamped on the mountains, could watch every movement\r\nof the Persians on the plain below, while they were enabled completely\r\nto mask their own. Miltiades also had, from his position, the power of\r\ngiving battle whenever he pleased, or of delaying it at his discretion,\r\nunless Datis were to attempt the perilous operation of storming the\r\nheights.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the map of the old world, to test the comparative\r\nterritorial resources of the two states whose armies were now about to\r\ncome into conflict, the immense preponderance of the material power of\r\nthe Persian king over that of the Athenian republic is more striking\r\nthan any similar contrast which history can supply. It has been truly\r\nremarked, that, in estimating mere areas, Attica, containing on\r\nits whole surface only seven hundred square miles, shrinks into\r\ninsignificance if compared with many a baronial fief of the Middle\r\nAges, or many a colonial allotment of modern times. Its antagonist, the\r\nPersian empire, comprised the whole of modern Asiatic and much of modern\r\nEuropean Turkey, the modern kingdom of Persia, and the countries of\r\nmodern Georgia, Armenia, Balkh, the Punjaub, Affghanistan, Beloochistan,\r\nEgypt, and Tripoli.\r\n\r\nNor could a European, in the beginning of the fifth century before our\r\nera, look upon this huge accumulation of power beneath the sceptre of a\r\nsingle Asiatic ruler, with the indifference with which we now observe on\r\nthe map the extensive dominions of modern Oriental sovereigns. For, as\r\nhas been already remarked, before Marathon was fought, the prestige\r\nof success and of supposed superiority of race was on the side of\r\nthe Asiatic against the European. Asia was the original seat of human\r\nsocieties and long before any trace can be found of the inhabitants of\r\nthe rest of the world having emerged from the rudest barbarism, we can\r\nperceive that mighty and brilliant empires flourished in the Asiatic\r\ncontinent. They appear before us through the twilight of primeval\r\nhistory, dim and indistinct, but massive and majestic, like mountains in\r\nthe early dawn.\r\n\r\nInstead, however, of the infinite variety and restless change which\r\nhave characterised the institutions and fortunes of European states\r\never since the commencement of the civilization of our continent, a\r\nmonotonous uniformity pervades the histories of nearly all Oriental\r\nempires, from the most ancient down to the most recent times. They are\r\ncharacterised by the rapidity of their early conquests; by the immense\r\nextent of the dominions comprised in them; by the establishment of a\r\nsatrap or pacha system of governing the provinces; by an invariable\r\nand speedy degeneracy in the princes of the royal house, the effeminate\r\nnurslings of the seraglio succeeding to the warrior-sovereigns reared in\r\nthe camp; and by the internal anarchy and insurrections, which indicate\r\nand accelerate the decline and fall of those unwieldy and ill-organized\r\nfabrics of power. It is also a striking fact that the governments of all\r\nthe great Asiatic empires have in all ages been absolute despotisms.\r\nAnd Heeren is right in connecting this with another great fact, which is\r\nimportant from its influence both on the political and the social life\r\nof Asiatics. \"Among all the considerable nations of Inner Asia, the\r\npaternal government of every household was corrupted by polygamy; where\r\nthat custom exists, a good political constitution is impossible. Fathers\r\nbeing converted into domestic despots, are ready to pay the same abject\r\nobedience to their sovereign which they exact from their family and\r\ndependants in their domestic economy.\" We should bear in mind also the\r\ninseparable connexion between the state religion and all legislation,\r\nwhich has always prevailed in the East, and the constant existence of a\r\npowerful sacerdotal body, exercising some check, though precarious and\r\nirregular, over the throne itself, grasping at all civil administration,\r\nclaiming the supreme control of education, stereotyping the lines in\r\nwhich literature and science must move, and limiting the extent to which\r\nit shall be lawful for the human mind to prosecute its inquiries.\r\n\r\nWith these general characteristics rightly felt and understood, it\r\nbecomes a comparatively easy task to investigate and appreciate the\r\norigin, progress, and principles of Oriental empires in general, as well\r\nas of the Persian monarchy in particular. And we are thus better enabled\r\nto appreciate the repulse which Greece gave to the arms of the East,\r\nand to judge of the probable consequences to human civilization, if the\r\nPersians had succeeded in bringing Europe under their yoke, as they had\r\nalready subjugated the fairest portions of the rest of the then known\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, from their geographical position, formed the natural\r\nvanguard of European liberty against Persian ambition; and they\r\npre-eminently displayed the salient points of distinctive national\r\ncharacter, which have rendered European civilization so far superior\r\nto Asiatic. The nations that dwelt in ancient times around and near\r\nthe northern shores of the Mediterranean Sea, were the first in our\r\ncontinent to receive from the East the rudiments of art and literature,\r\nand the germs of social and political organization. Of these nations,\r\nthe Greeks, through their vicinity to Asia Minor, Phoenicia, and Egypt,\r\nwere among the very foremost in acquiring the principles and habits of\r\ncivilized life; and they also at once imparted a new and wholly original\r\nstamp on all which they received. Thus, in their religion they received\r\nfrom foreign settlers the names of all their deities and many of their\r\nrites, but they discarded the loathsome monstrosities of the Nile, the\r\nOrontes, and the Ganges;--they nationalized their creed; and their\r\nown poets created their beautiful mythology. No sacerdotal caste ever\r\nexisted in Greece. So, in their governments they lived long under\r\nhereditary kings, but never endured the permanent establishment of\r\nabsolute monarchy. Their early kings were constitutional rulers,\r\ngoverning with defined prerogatives. And long before the Persian\r\ninvasion the kingly form of government had given way in almost all the\r\nGreek states to republican institutions, presenting infinite varieties\r\nof the balancing or the alternate predominance of the oligarchical and\r\ndemocratical principles. In literature and science the Greek intellect\r\nfollowed no beaten track, and acknowledged no limitary rules. The Greeks\r\nthought their subjects boldly out; and the novelty of a speculation\r\ninvested it in their minds with interest, and not with criminality.\r\nVersatile, restless, enterprising and self-confident, the Greeks\r\npresented the most striking contrast to the habitual quietude and\r\nsubmissiveness of the Orientals. And, of all the Greeks, the Athenians\r\nexhibited these national characteristics in the strongest degree. This\r\nspirit of activity and daring, joined to a generous sympathy for the\r\nfate of their fellow-Greeks in Asia, had led them to join in the last\r\nIonian war; and now, mingling with their abhorrence of the usurping\r\nfamily of their own citizens, which for a period had forcibly seized on\r\nand exercised despotic power at Athens, it nerved them to defy the wrath\r\nof King Darius, and to refuse to receive back at his bidding the tyrant\r\nwhom they had some years before driven from their land.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise and genius of an Englishman have lately confirmed by\r\nfresh evidence, and invested with fresh interest, the might of the\r\nPersian monarch, who sent his troops to combat at Marathon. Inscriptions\r\nin a character termed the Arrow-headed, or Cuneiform, had long been\r\nknown to exist on the marble monuments at Persepolis, near the site of\r\nthe ancient Susa, and on the faces of rocks in other places formerly\r\nruled over by the early Persian kings. But for thousands of years\r\nthey had been mere unintelligible enigmas to the curious but baffled\r\nbeholder: and they were often referred to as instances of the folly of\r\nhuman pride, which could indeed write its own praises in the solid rock,\r\nbut only for the rock to outlive the language as well as the memory of\r\nthe vain-glorious inscribers. The elder Niebuhr, Grotefend, and Lassen\r\nhad made some guesses at the meaning of the Cuneiform letters; but Major\r\nRawlinson, of the East India Company's service, after years of labour,\r\nhas at last accomplished the glorious achievement of fully revealing\r\nthe alphabet and the grammar of this long unknown tongue. He has, in\r\nparticular, fully deciphered and expounded the inscriptions on the\r\nsacred rock of Behistun, on the western frontiers of Media. These\r\nrecords of the Achaemenidae have at length found their interpreter; and\r\nDarius himself speaks to us from the consecrated mountain, and tells\r\nus the names of the nations that obeyed him, the revolts that he\r\nsuppressed, his victories, his piety, and his glory. [See the tenth\r\nvolume of the \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society.\"]\r\n\r\nKings who thus seek the admiration of posterity are little likely to\r\ndim the record of their successes by the mention of their occasional\r\ndefeats; and it throws no suspicion on the narrative of the Greek\r\nhistorians, that we find these inscriptions silent respecting the\r\noverthrow of Datis and Artaphernes, as well as respecting the reverses\r\nwhich Darius sustained in person during his Scythian campaigns. But\r\nthese indisputable monuments of Persian fame confirm, and even increase,\r\nthe opinion with which Herodotus inspires us, of the vast power which\r\nCyrus founded and Cambyses increased; which Darius augmented by Indian\r\nand Arabian conquests, and seemed likely, when he directed his arms\r\nagainst Europe, to make the predominant monarchy of the world.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Chinese empire, in which, throughout all ages\r\ndown to the last few years, one-third of the human race has dwelt almost\r\nunconnected with the other portions, all the great kingdoms which we\r\nknow to have existed in Ancient Asia, were, in Darius's time, blended\r\nwith the Persian. The northern Indians, the Assyrians, the Syrians, the\r\nBabylonians, the Chaldees, the Phoenicians, the nations of Palestine,\r\nthe Armenians, the Bactrians, the Lydians, the Phrygians, the Parthians,\r\nand the Medes,--all obeyed the sceptre of the Great King: the Medes\r\nstanding next to the native Persians in honour, and the empire being\r\nfrequently spoken of as that of the Medes, or as that of the Medes and\r\nPersians. Egypt and Cyrene were Persian provinces; the Greek colonists\r\nin Asia Minor and the islands of the AEgean were Darius's subjects; and\r\ntheir gallant but unsuccessful attempts to throw off the Persian yoke\r\nhad only served to rivet it more strongly, and to increase the general\r\nbelief: that the Greeks could not stand before the Persians in a field\r\nof battle. Darius's Scythian war, though unsuccessful in its immediate\r\nobject, had brought about the subjugation of Thrace and the submission\r\nof Macedonia. From the Indus to the Peneus, all was his.\r\n\r\nWe may imagine the wrath with which the lord of so many nations must\r\nhave heard, nine years before the battle of Marathon, that a strange\r\nnation towards the setting sun, called the Athenians, had dared to help\r\nhis rebels in Ionia against him, and that they had plundered and burnt\r\nthe capital of one of his provinces. Before the burning of Sardis,\r\nDarius seems never to have heard of the existence of Athens; but his\r\nsatraps in Asia Minor had for some time seen Athenian refugees at their\r\nprovincial courts imploring assistance against their fellow-countrymen.\r\nWhen Hippias was driven away from Athens, and the tyrannic dynasty of\r\nthe Pisistratidae finally overthrown in 510 B.C., the banished tyrant\r\nand his adherents, after vainly seeking to be restored by Spartan\r\nintervention, had betaken themselves to Sardis, the capital city of\r\nthe satrapy of Artaphernes. There Hippias (in the expressive words\r\nof Herodotus) [Herod. lib. v. c. 96.] began every kind of agitation,\r\nslandering the Athenians before Artaphernes, and doing all he could to\r\ninduce the satrap to place Athens in subjection to him, as the tributary\r\nvassal of King Darius. When the Athenians heard of his practices, they\r\nsent envoys to Sardis to remonstrate with the Persians against taking up\r\nthe quarrel of the Athenian refugees. But Artaphernes gave them in reply\r\na menacing command to receive Hippias back again if they looked for\r\nsafety. The Athenians were resolved not to purchase safety at such a\r\nprice; and after rejecting the satrap's terms, they considered that they\r\nand the Persians were declared enemies. At this very crisis the Ionian\r\nGreeks implored the assistance of their European brethren, to enable\r\nthem to recover their independence from Persia. Athens, and the city of\r\nEretria in Euboea, alone consented. Twenty Athenian galleys, and five\r\nEretrian, crossed the AEgean Sea; and by a bold and sudden march upon\r\nSardis the Athenians and their allies succeeded in capturing the capital\r\ncity of the haughty satrap, who had recently menaced them with servitude\r\nor destruction. The Persian forces were soon rallied, and the Greeks\r\nwere compelled to retire. They were pursued, and defeated on their\r\nreturn to the coast, and Athens took no further part in the Ionian war.\r\nBut the insult that she had put upon the Persian power was speedily made\r\nknown throughout that empire, and was never to be forgiven or forgotten.\r\nIn the emphatic simplicity of the narrative of Herodotus, the wrath of\r\nthe Great King is thus described:--\"Now when it was told to King Darius\r\nthat Sardis had been taken and burnt by the Athenians and Ionians, he\r\ntook small heed of the Ionians, well knowing who they were, and that\r\ntheir revolt would soon be put down: but he asked who, and what manner\r\nof men, the Athenians were. And when he had been told, he called for his\r\nbow; and, having taken it, and placed an arrow on the string, he let the\r\narrow fly towards heaven; and as he shot it into the air, he said, 'O\r\nSupreme God! grant me that I may avenge myself on the Athenians.' And\r\nwhen he had said this, he appointed one of his servants to say to him\r\nevery day as he sat at meat, 'Sire, remember the Athenians.'\"\r\n\r\nSome years were occupied in the complete reduction of Ionia. But when\r\nthis was effected, Darius ordered his victorious forces to proceed to\r\npunish Athens and Eretria, and to conquer European Greece. The first\r\narmament sent for this purpose was shattered by shipwreck, and nearly\r\ndestroyed off Mount Athos, But the purpose of King Darius was not\r\neasily shaken. A larger army was ordered to be collected in Cilicia; and\r\nrequisitions were sent to all the maritime cities of the Persian empire\r\nfor ships of war, and for transports of sufficient size for carrying\r\ncavalry as well as infantry across the AEgean. While these preparations\r\nwere being made, Darius sent heralds round to the Grecian cities\r\ndemanding their submission to Persia. It was proclaimed in the\r\nmarket-place of each little Hellenic state (some with territories not\r\nlarger than the Isle of Wight), that King Darius, the lord of all men,\r\nfrom the rising to the setting sun, required earth and water to be\r\ndelivered to his heralds, as a symbolical acknowledgment that he was\r\nhead and master of the country. [Aeschines in Ctes. p. 622, ed. Reiske.\r\nMitford, vol. i. p. 485. AEschines is speaking of Xerxes, but Mitford\r\nis probably right in considering it as the style of the Persian kings\r\nin their proclamations. In one of the inscriptions at Persepolis, Darius\r\nterms himself \"Darius the great king, king of kings, the king of the\r\nmany peopled countries, the supporter also of this great world.\" In\r\nanother, he styles himself \"the king of all inhabited countries.\"\r\n(See \"Asiatic Journal\" vol. X pp. 287 and 292, and Major Rawlinson's\r\nComments.)] Terror-stricken at the power of Persia and at the severe\r\npunishment that had recently been inflicted on the refractory Ionians,\r\nmany of the continental Greeks and nearly all the islanders submitted,\r\nand gave the required tokens of vassalage. At Sparta and Athens an\r\nindignant refusal was returned: a refusal which was disgraced by outrage\r\nand violence against the persons of the Asiatic heralds.\r\n\r\nFresh fuel was thus added to the anger of Darius against Athens, and the\r\nPersian preparations went on with renewed vigour. In the summer of 490\r\nB.C., the army destined for the invasion was assembled in the Aleian\r\nplain of Cilicia, near the sea. A fleet of six hundred galleys and\r\nnumerous transports was collected on the coast for the embarkation\r\nof troops, horse as well as foot. A Median general named Datis, and\r\nArtaphernes, the son of the satrap of Sardis, and who was also nephew of\r\nDarius, were placed in titular joint command of the expedition. That the\r\nreal supreme authority was given to Datis alone is probable, from the\r\nway in which the Greek writers speak of him. We know no details of the\r\nprevious career of this officer; but there is every reason to believe\r\nthat his abilities and bravery had been proved by experience, or his\r\nMedian birth would have prevented his being placed in high command by\r\nDarius. He appears to have been the first Mede who was thus trusted by\r\nthe Persian kings after the overthrow of the conspiracy of the Median\r\nMagi against the Persians immediately before Darius obtained the throne.\r\nDatis received instructions to complete the subjugation of Greece, and\r\nespecial orders were given him with regard to Eretria and Athens. He\r\nwas to take these two cities; and he was to lead the inhabitants away\r\ncaptive, and bring them as slaves into the presence of the Great King.\r\n\r\nDatis embarked his forces in the fleet that awaited them; and coasting\r\nalong the shores of Asia Minor till he was off Samos, he thence sailed\r\ndue westward through the AEgean Sea for Greece, taking the islands in\r\nhis way. The Naxians had, ten years before, successfully stood a siege\r\nagainst a Persian armament, but they now were too terrified to offer any\r\nresistance, and fled to the mountain-tops, while the enemy burnt their\r\ntown and laid waste their lands. Thence Datis, compelling the Greek\r\nislanders to join him with their ships and men, sailed onward to the\r\ncoast of Euboea. The little town of Carystus essayed resistance, but was\r\nquickly overpowered. He next attacked Eretria. The Athenians sent four\r\nthousand men to its aid. But treachery was at work among the Eretrians;\r\nand the Athenian force received timely warning from one of the leading\r\nmen of the city to retire to aid in saving their own country, instead\r\nof remaining to share in the inevitable destruction of Eretria. Left to\r\nthemselves, the Eretrians repulsed the assaults of the Persians against\r\ntheir walls for six days; on the seventh day they were betrayed by two\r\nof their chiefs and the Persians occupied the city. The temples were\r\nburnt in revenge for the burning of Sardis, and the inhabitants were\r\nbound and placed as prisoners in the neighbouring islet of AEgylia,\r\nto wait there till Datis should bring the Athenians to join them in\r\ncaptivity, when both populations were to be led into Upper Asia, there\r\nto learn their doom from the lips of King Darius himself.\r\n\r\nFlushed with success, and with half his mission thus accomplished, Datis\r\nreimbarked his troops, and crossing the little channel that separates\r\nEuboea from the mainland, he encamped his troops on the Attic coast\r\nat Marathon, drawing up his galleys on the shelving beach, as was the\r\ncustom with the navies of antiquity. The conquered islands behind him\r\nserved as places of deposit for his provisions and military stores. His\r\nposition at Marathon seemed to him in every respect advantageous; and\r\nthe level nature of the ground on which he camped was favourable for\r\nthe employment of his cavalry, if the Athenians should venture to\r\nengage him. Hippias, who accompanied him, and acted as the guide of the\r\ninvaders, had pointed out Marathon as the best place for a landing,\r\nfor this very reason. Probably Hippias was also influenced by the\r\nrecollection, that forty-seven years previously he, with his father\r\nPisistratus, had crossed with an army from Eretria to Marathon, and\r\nhad won an easy victory over their Athenian enemies on that very plain,\r\nwhich had restored them to tyrannic power. The omen seemed cheering.\r\nThe place was the same; but Hippias soon learned to his cost how great a\r\nchange had come over the spirit of the Athenians.\r\n\r\nBut though \"the fierce democracy\" of Athens was zealous and true against\r\nforeign invader and domestic tyrant, a faction existed in Athens, as\r\nat Eretria, of men willing to purchase a party triumph over their\r\nfellow-citizens at the price of their country's ruin. Communications\r\nwere opened between these men and the Persian camp, which would have led\r\nto a catastrophe like that of Eretria, if Miltiades had not resolved,\r\nand had not persuaded his colleagues to resolve, on fighting at all\r\nhazards.\r\n\r\nWhen Miltiades arrayed his men for action, he staked on the arbitrement\r\nof one battle not only the fate of Athens, but that of all Greece; for\r\nif Athens had fallen, no other Greek state, except Lacedaemon, would\r\nhave had the courage to resist; and the Lacedaemonians, though they\r\nwould probably have died in their ranks to the last man, never could\r\nhave successfully resisted the victorious Persians, and the numerous\r\nGreek troops, which would have soon marched under the Persian satraps,\r\nhad they prevailed over Athens.\r\n\r\nNor was there any power to the westward of Greece that could have\r\noffered an effectual opposition to Persia, had she once conquered\r\nGreece, and made that country a basis for future military operations.\r\nRome was at this time in her season of utmost weakness. Her dynasty of\r\npowerful Etruscan kings had been driven out, and her infant commonwealth\r\nwas reeling under the attacks of the Etruscans and Volscians from\r\nwithout, and the fierce dissensions between the patricians and plebeians\r\nwithin. Etruria, with her Lucumos and serfs, was no match for Persia.\r\nSamnium had not grown into the might which she afterwards put forth: nor\r\ncould the Greek colonies in South Italy and Sicily hope to survive when\r\ntheir parent states had perished. Carthage had escaped the Persian\r\nyoke in the time of Cambyses, through the reluctance of the Phoenician\r\nmariners to serve against their kinsmen. But such forbearance could not\r\nlong have been relied on, and the future rival of Rome would have become\r\nas submissive a minister of the Persian power as were the Phoenician\r\ncities themselves. If we turn to Spain, or if we pass the great mountain\r\nchain which, prolonged through the Pyrenees, the Cevennes, the Alps, and\r\nthe Balkan, divides Northern from Southern Europe, we shall find nothing\r\nat that period but mere savage Finns, Celts, Slaves, and Teutons. Had\r\nPersia beaten Athens at Marathon, she could have found no obstacle to\r\nprevent Darius, the chosen servant of Ormuzd, from advancing his sway\r\nover all the known Western races of mankind. The infant energies of\r\nEurope would have been trodden out beneath universal conquest; and the\r\nhistory of the world, like the history of Asia, would have become a mere\r\nrecord of the rise and fall of despotic dynasties, of the incursions\r\nof barbarous hordes, and of the mental and political prostration of\r\nmillions beneath the diadem, the tiara, and the sword.\r\n\r\nGreat as the preponderance of the Persian over the Athenian power\r\nat that crisis seems to have been, it would be unjust to impute wild\r\nrashness to the policy of Miltiades, and those who voted with him in the\r\nAthenian council of war, or to look on the after-current of events as\r\nthe mere result of successful indiscretion, as before has been remarked,\r\nMiltiades, whilst prince of the Chersonese, had seen service in the\r\nPersian armies; and he knew by personal observation how many elements of\r\nweakness lurked beneath their imposing aspect of strength. He knew that\r\nthe bulk of their troops no longer consisted of the hardy shepherds and\r\nmountaineers from Persia Proper and Kurdistan, who won Cyrus's battles:\r\nbut that unwilling contingents from conquered nations now largely filled\r\nup the Persian muster rolls, fighting more from compulsion than from\r\nany zeal in the cause of their masters. He had also the sagacity and\r\nthe spirit to appreciate the superiority of the Greek armour and\r\norganization over the Asiatic, notwithstanding former reverses. Above\r\nall, he felt and worthily trusted the enthusiasm of the men under his\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, whom he led, had proved by their new-born valour in\r\nrecent wars against the neighbouring states, that \"Liberty and Equality\r\nof civic rights are brave spirit-stirring things: and they who, while\r\nunder the yoke of a despot, had been no better men of war than any of\r\ntheir neighbours, as soon as they were free, became the foremost men of\r\nall; for each felt that in fighting for a free commonwealth, he fought\r\nfor himself, and, whatever he took in hand, he was zealous to do the\r\nwork thoroughly.\" So the nearly contemporaneous historian describes the\r\nchange of spirit that was seen in the Athenians after their tyrants were\r\nexpelled; [Herod. lib. v. c. 87.] and Miltiades knew that in leading\r\nthem against the invading army, where they had Hippias, the foe they\r\nmost hated, before them, he was bringing into battle no ordinary men,\r\nand could calculate on no ordinary heroism. As for traitors, he was\r\nsure, that whatever treachery might lurk among some of the higher-born\r\nand wealthier Athenians, the rank and file whom he commanded were ready\r\nto do their utmost in his and their own cause. With regard to future\r\nattacks from Asia, he might reasonably hope that one victory would\r\ninspirit all Greece to combine against common foe; and that the latent\r\nseeds of revolt and disunion in the Persian empire would soon burst\r\nforth and paralyse its energies, so as to leave Greek independence\r\nsecure.\r\n\r\nWith these hopes and risks, Miltiades, on the afternoon of a September\r\nday, 490 B.C., gave the word for the Athenian army to prepare for\r\nbattle. There were many local associations connected with those mountain\r\nheights, which were calculated powerfully to excite the spirits of the\r\nmen, and of which the commanders well knew how to avail themselves in\r\ntheir exhortations to their troops before the encounter. Marathon itself\r\nwas a region sacred to; Hercules. Close to them was the fountain of\r\nMacaria, who had in days of yore devoted herself to death for the\r\nliberty of her people. The very plain on which they were to fight was\r\nthe scene of the exploits of their national hero, Theseus; and there,\r\ntoo, as old legends told, the Athenians and the Heraclidae had routed\r\nthe invader, Eurystheus. These traditions were not mere cloudy myths, or\r\nidle fictions, but matters of implicit earnest faith to the men of that\r\nday: and many a fervent prayer arose from the Athenian ranks to the\r\nheroic spirits who while on earth had striven and suffered on that very\r\nspot, and who were believed to be now heavenly powers, looking down with\r\ninterest on their still beloved country, and capable of interposing with\r\nsuperhuman aid in its behalf.\r\n\r\nAccording to old national custom, the warriors of each tribe were\r\narrayed together; neighbour thus fighting by the side of neighbour,\r\nfriend by friend, and the spirit of emulation and the consciousness of\r\nresponsibility excited to the very utmost. The War-Ruler, Callimachus,\r\nhad the leading of the right wing; the Plataeans formed the extreme\r\nleft; and Themistocles and Aristides commanded the centre. The line\r\nconsisted of the heavy-armed spearmen only. For the Greeks (until the\r\ntime of Iphicrates) took little or no account of light-armed soldiers in\r\na pitched battle, using them only in skirmishes or for the pursuit of a\r\ndefeated enemy. The panoply of the regular infantry consisted of a long\r\nspear, of a shield, helmet, breast-plate, greaves, and short sword. Thus\r\nequipped, they usually advanced slowly and steadily into action in an\r\nuniform phalanx of about eight spears deep. But the military genius\r\nof Miltiades led him to deviate on this occasion from the commonplace\r\ntactics of his countrymen. It was essential for him to extend his line\r\nso as to cover all the practicable ground, and to secure himself from\r\nbeing outflanked and charged in the rear by the Persian horse. This\r\nextension involved the weakening of his line. Instead of an uniform\r\nreduction of its strength, he determined on detaching principally from\r\nhis centre, which, from the nature of the ground, would have the best\r\nopportunities for rallying if broken; and on strengthening his wings, so\r\nas to insure advantage at those points; and he trusted to his own skill,\r\nand to his soldiers' discipline, for the improvement of that advantage\r\ninto decisive victory.\r\n\r\n[It is remarkable that there is no other instance of a Greek general\r\ndeviating from the ordinary mode of bringing a phalanx of spearmen into\r\naction, until the battles of Leuctra and Mantineia, more than a century\r\nafter Marathon, when Epaminondas introduced the tactics (which Alexander\r\nthe Great in ancient times, and Frederic the Great in modern times, made\r\nso famous) of concentrating an overpowering force on some decisive point\r\nof the enemy's line, while he kept back, or, in military phrase, refused\r\nthe weaker part of his own.]\r\n\r\nIn this order, and availing himself probably of the inequalities of the\r\nground, so as to conceal his preparations from the enemy till the last\r\npossible moment, Miltiades drew up the eleven thousand infantry whose\r\nspears were to decide this crisis in the struggle between the European\r\nand the Asiatic worlds. The sacrifices, by which the favour of Heaven\r\nwas sought, and its will consulted, were announced to show propitious\r\nomens. The trumpet sounded for action, and, chanting the hymn of battle,\r\nthe little army bore down upon the host of the foe. Then, too, along the\r\nmountain slopes of Marathon must have resounded the mutual exhortation\r\nwhich AEschylus, who fought in both battles, tells us was afterwards\r\nheard over the waves of Salamis,--\"On, sons of the Greeks! Strike for\r\nthe freedom of your country! strike for the freedom of your children\r\nand of your wives--for the shrines of your fathers' gods, and for the\r\nsepulchres of your sires. All--all are now staked upon the strife!\"\r\n\r\nInstead of advancing at the usual slow pace of the phalanx, Miltiades\r\nbrought his men on at a run. They were all trained in the exercises of\r\nthe palaestra, so that there was no fear of their ending the charge in\r\nbreathless exhaustion: and it was of the deepest importance for him\r\nto traverse as rapidly as possible the space of about a mile of level\r\nground, that lay between the mountain foot and the Persian outposts, and\r\nso to get his troops into close action before the Asiatic cavalry could\r\nmount, form, and manoeuvre against him, or their archers keep him long\r\nunder bow-shot, and before the enemy's generals could fairly deploy\r\ntheir masses.\r\n\r\n\"When the Persians,\" says Herodotus, \"saw the Athenians running down on\r\nthem, without horse or bowmen, and scanty in numbers, they thought them\r\na set of madmen rushing upon certain destruction.\" They began, however,\r\nto prepare to receive them and the Eastern chiefs arrayed, as quickly\r\nas time and place allowed, the varied races who served in their motley\r\nranks. Mountaineers from Hyrcania and Affghanistan, wild horsemen from\r\nthe steppes of Khorassan, the black archers of Ethiopia, swordsmen from\r\nthe banks of the Indus, the Oxus, the Euphrates, and the Nile, made\r\nready against the enemies of the Great King. But no national cause\r\ninspired them, except the division of native Persians; and in the large\r\nhost there was no uniformity of language, creed, race, or military\r\nsystem. Still, among them there were many gallant men, under a veteran\r\ngeneral; they were familiarized with victory; and in contemptuous\r\nconfidence their infantry, which alone had time to form, awaited\r\nthe Athenian charge. On came the Greeks, with one unwavering line of\r\nlevelled spears, against which the light targets, the short lances and\r\nscymetars of the Orientals offered weak defence. The front rank of the\r\nAsiatics must have gone down to a man at the first shock. Still they\r\nrecoiled not, but strove by individual gallantry, and by the weight of\r\nnumbers, to make up for the disadvantages of weapons and tactics, and\r\nto bear back the shallow line of the Europeans. In the centre, where the\r\nnative Persians and the Sacae fought, they succeeded in breaking through\r\nthe weaker part of the Athenian phalanx; and the tribes led by Aristides\r\nand Themistocles were, after a brave resistance, driven back over\r\nthe plain, and chased by the Persians up the valley towards the inner\r\ncountry. There the nature of the ground gave the opportunity of rallying\r\nand renewing the struggle: and meanwhile, the Greek wings, where\r\nMiltiades had concentrated his chief strength, had routed the Asiatics\r\nopposed to them; and the Athenian and Plataean officers, instead of\r\npursuing the fugitives, kept their troops well in hand, and wheeling\r\nround they formed the two wings together. Miltiades instantly led them\r\nagainst the Persian centre, which had hitherto been triumphant, but\r\nwhich now fell back, and prepared to encounter these new and unexpected\r\nassailants. Aristides and Themistocles renewed the fight with their\r\nre-organized troops, and the full force of the Greeks was brought into\r\nclose action with the Persian and Sacian divisions of the enemy. Datis's\r\nveterans strove hard to keep their ground, and evening [ARISTOPH. Vesvoe\r\n1085.] was approaching before the stern encounter was decided.\r\n\r\nBut the Persians, with their slight wicker shields, destitute of\r\nbody-armour, and never taught by training to keep the even front and\r\nact with the regular movement of the Greek infantry, fought at grievous\r\ndisadvantage with their shorter and feebler weapons against the compact\r\narray of well-armed Athenian and Plataean spearmen, all perfectly\r\ndrilled to perform each necessary evolution in concert, and to preserve\r\nan uniform and unwavering line in battle. In personal courage and in\r\nbodily activity the Persians were not inferior to their adversaries.\r\nTheir spirits were not yet cowed by the recollection of former defeats;\r\nand they lavished their lives freely, rather than forfeit the fame which\r\nthey had won by so many victories. While their rear ranks poured\r\nan incessant shower of arrows over the heads of their comrades, the\r\nforemost Persians kept rushing forward, sometimes singly, sometimes\r\nin desperate groups of twelve or ten upon the projecting spears of the\r\nGreeks, striving to force a lane into the phalanx, and to bring their\r\nscimetars and daggers into play. But the Greeks felt their superiority,\r\nand though the fatigue of the long-continued action told heavily on\r\ntheir inferior numbers, the sight of the carnage that they dealt amongst\r\ntheir assailants nerved them to fight still more fiercely on.\r\n\r\n[See the description, in the 62nd section of the ninth book of\r\nHerodotus, of the gallantry shown by the Persian infantry against the\r\nLacedaemonians at Plataea. We have no similar detail of the fight at\r\nMarathon, but we know that it was long and obstinately contested (see\r\nthe 113th section of the sixth book of Herodotus, and the lines from the\r\n\"Vespae\" already quoted), and the spirit of the Persians must have been\r\neven higher at Marathon than at Plataea. In both battles it was only the\r\ntrue Persians and the Sacae who showed this valour; the other Asiatics\r\nfled like sheep.]\r\n\r\nAt last the previously unvanquished lords of Asia turned their backs and\r\nfled, and the Greeks followed, striking them down, to the water's edge,\r\nwhere the invaders were now hastily launching their galleys, and seeking\r\nto embark and fly. Flushed with success, the Athenians dashed at the\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [The flying Mede, his shaftless broken bow;\r\n      The fiery Greek, his red pursuing spear;\r\n      Mountains above, Earth's, Ocean's plain below,\r\n      Death in the front, Destruction in the rear!\r\n      Such was the scene.--Byron's CHILDE HARROLD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Bring fire, bring fire,\" was their cry; and they began to lay hold of\r\nthe ships. But here the Asiatics resisted desperately, and the principal\r\nloss sustained by the Greeks was in the assault on the fleet. Here\r\nfell the brave War-Ruler Callimachus, the general Stesilaus, and other\r\nAthenians of note. Conspicuous among them was Cynaegeirus, the brother\r\nof the tragic poet AEschylus. He had grasped the ornamental work on\r\nthe stern of one of the galleys, and had his hand struck off by an axe.\r\nSeven galleys were captured; but the Persians succeeded in saving the\r\nrest. They pushed off from the fatal shore: but even here the skill of\r\nDatis did not desert him, and he sailed round to the western coast of\r\nAttica, in hopes to find the city unprotected, and to gain possession\r\nof it from some of the partisans of Hippias. Miltiades, however, saw\r\nand counteracted his manoeuvre. Leaving Aristides, and the troops of his\r\ntribe, to guard the spoil and the slain, the Athenian commander led\r\nhis conquering army by a rapid night-march back across the country to\r\nAthens. And when the Persian fleet had doubled the Cape of Sunium and\r\nsailed up to the Athenian harbour in the morning, Datis saw arrayed on\r\nthe heights above the city the troops before whom his men had fled on\r\nthe preceding evening. All hope of further conquest in Europe for the\r\ntime was abandoned, and the baffled armada returned to the Asiatic\r\ncoasts.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle had been fought, but while the dead bodies were yet on\r\nthe ground, the promised reinforcement from Sparta arrived. Two thousand\r\nLacedaemonian spearmen, starting immediately after the full moon, had\r\nmarched the hundred and fifty miles between Athens and Sparta in the\r\nwonderfully short time of three days. Though too late to share in\r\nthe glory of the action, they requested to be allowed to march to the\r\nbattle-field to behold the Medes. They proceeded thither, gazed on the\r\ndead bodies of the invaders, and then, praising the Athenians and what\r\nthey had done, they returned to Lacedaemon.\r\n\r\nThe number of the Persian dead was six thousand four hundred; of the\r\nAthenians, a hundred and ninety-two. The number of Plataeans who fell is\r\nnot mentioned, but as they fought in the part of the army which was not\r\nbroken, it cannot have been large.\r\n\r\nThe apparent disproportion between the losses of the two armies is not\r\nsurprising, when we remember the armour of the Greek spearmen, and the\r\nimpossibility of heavy slaughter being inflicted by sword or lance on\r\ntroops so armed, as long as they kept firm in their ranks. [Mitford\r\nwell refers to Crecy, Poictiers, and Agincourt, as instances of similar\r\ndisparity of loss between the conquerors and the conquered.]\r\n\r\nThe Athenian slain were buried on the field of battle. This was contrary\r\nto the usual custom, according to which the bones of all who fell\r\nfighting for their country in each year were deposited in a public\r\nsepulchre in the suburb of Athens called the Cerameicus. But it was felt\r\nthat a distinction ought to be made in the funeral honours paid to the\r\nmen of Marathon, even as their merit had been distinguished over that of\r\nall other Athenians. A lofty mound was raised on the plain of Marathon,\r\nbeneath which the remains of the men of Athens who fell in the battle\r\nwere deposited. Ten columns were erected on the spot, one for each of\r\nthe Athenian tribes; and on the monumental column of each tribe were\r\ngraven the names of those of its members whose glory it was to have\r\nfallen in the great battle of liberation. The antiquary Pausanias read\r\nthose names there six hundred years after the time when they were first\r\ngraven. The columns have long perished, but the mound still marks the\r\nspot where the noblest heroes of antiquity, the MARATHONOMAKHOI repose.\r\n[Pausanias states, with implicit belief, that the battlefield was\r\nhaunted at night by supernatural beings, and that the noise of\r\ncombatants and the snorting of horses were heard to resound on it. The\r\nsuperstition has survived the change of creeds, and the shepherds of the\r\nneighbourhood still believe that spectral warriors contend on the\r\nplain at midnight, and they say that they have heard the shouts of the\r\ncombatants and the neighing of the steeds. See Grote and Thirlwall.]\r\n\r\nA separate tumulus was raised over the bodies of the slain Plataeans,\r\nand another over the light-armed slaves who had taken part and had\r\nfallen in the battle. [It is probable that the Greek light-armed\r\nirregulars were active in the attack on the Persian ships and it was in\r\nthis attack that the Greeks suffered their principal loss.] There was\r\nalso a distinct sepulchral monument to the general to whose genius\r\nthe victory was mainly due. Miltiades did not live long after his\r\nachievement at Marathon, but he lived long enough to experience a\r\nlamentable reverse of his popularity and good fortune. As soon as the\r\nPersians had quitted the western coasts of the AEgean, he proposed to\r\nan assembly of the Athenian people that they should fit out seventy\r\ngalleys, with a proportionate force of soldiers and military stores,\r\nand place them at his disposal; not telling them whither he meant to\r\nproceed, but promising them that if they would equip the force he asked\r\nfor, and give him discretionary powers, he would lead it to a land where\r\nthere was gold in abundance to be won with ease. The Greeks of that time\r\nbelieved in the existence of Eastern realms teeming with gold, as firmly\r\nas the Europeans of the sixteenth century believed in Eldorado of the\r\nWest. The Athenians probably thought that the recent victor of Marathon,\r\nand former officer of Darius, was about to guide them on a secret\r\nexpedition against some wealthy and unprotected cities of treasure in\r\nthe Persian dominions. The armament was voted and equipped, and sailed\r\neastward from Attica, no one but Miltiades knowing its destination,\r\nuntil the Greek isle of Paros was reached, when his true object\r\nappeared. In former years, while connected with the Persians as prince\r\nof the Chersonese, Miltiades had been involved in a quarrel with one of\r\nthe leading men among the Parians, who had injured his credit and caused\r\nsome slights to be put upon him at the court of the Persian satrap,\r\nHydarnes. The feud had ever since rankled in the heart of the Athenian\r\nchief, and he now attacked Paros for the sake of avenging himself on his\r\nancient enemy. His pretext, as general of the Athenians, was, that the\r\nParians had aided the armament of Datis with a war-galley. The Parians\r\npretended to treat about terms of surrender, but used the time which\r\nthey thus gained in repairing the defective parts of the fortifications\r\nof their city; and they then set the Athenians at defiance. So far, says\r\nHerodotus, the accounts of all the Greeks agree. But the Parians, in\r\nafter years, told also a wild legend, how a captive priestess of a\r\nParian temple of the Deities of the Earth promised Miltiades to give him\r\nthe means of capturing Paros: how, at her bidding, the Athenian general\r\nwent alone at night and forced his way into a holy shrine, near the city\r\ngate, but with what purpose it was not known: how a supernatural awe\r\ncame over him, and in his flight he fell and fractured his leg: how\r\nan oracle afterwards forbad the Parians to punish the sacrilegious and\r\ntraitorous priestess, \"because it was fated that Miltiades should come\r\nto an ill end, and she was only the instrument to lead him to evil.\"\r\nSuch was the tale that Herodotus heard at Paros. Certain it was that\r\nMiltiades either dislocated or broke his leg during an unsuccessful\r\nsiege of that city, and returned home in evil plight with his baffled\r\nand defeated forces.\r\n\r\nThe indignation of the Athenians was proportionate to the hope and\r\nexcitement which his promises had raised. Xanthippus, the head of one\r\nof the first families in Athens, indicted him before the supreme popular\r\ntribunal for the capital offence of having deceived the people.\r\nHis guilt was undeniable, and the Athenians passed their verdict\r\naccordingly. But the recollections of Lemnos and Marathon, and the sight\r\nof the fallen general who lay stretched on a couch before them, pleaded\r\nsuccessfully in mitigation of punishment, and the sentence was commuted\r\nfrom death to a fine of fifty talents. This was paid by his son, the\r\nafterwards illustrious Cimon, Miltiades dying, soon after the trial, of\r\nthe injury which he had received at Paros.\r\n\r\n[The common-place calumnies against the Athenians respecting Miltiades\r\nhave been well answered by Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton in his \"Rise and\r\nFall of Athens,\" and Bishop Thirlwall in the second volume of his\r\n\"History of Greece;\" but they have received their most complete\r\nrefutation from Mr. Grote in the fourth volume of his History, p.490 et\r\nseq., and notes. I quite concur with him that, \"looking to the practice\r\nof the Athenian dicastery in criminal cases, fifty talents was the minor\r\npenalty actually proposed by the defenders of Miltiades themselves as a\r\nsubstitute for the punishment of death. In those penal cases at Athens,\r\nwhere the punishment was not fixed beforehand by the terms of the law,\r\nif the person accused was found guilty, it was customary to submit to\r\nthe jurors subsequently and separately, the question as to the amount\r\nof punishment. First, the accuser named the penalty which he thought\r\nsuitable; next, the accused person was called upon to name an amount\r\nof penalty for himself, and the jurors were constrained to take their\r\nchoice between these two; no third gradation of penalty being admissible\r\nfor consideration. Of course, under such circumstances, it was the\r\ninterest of the accused party to name, even in his own case, some real\r\nand serious penalty, something which the jurors might be likely to deem\r\nnot wholly inadequate to his crime just proved; for if he proposed\r\nsome penalty only trifling, he drove them to far the heavier sentence\r\nrecommended by his opponent.\" The stories of Miltiades having been cast\r\ninto prison and died there, and of his having been saved from death only\r\nby the interposition of the Prytanis of the day, are, I think, rightly\r\nrejected by Mr. Grote as the fictions of after ages. The silence of\r\nHerodotus respecting them is decisive. It is true that Plato, in the\r\nGorgias, says that the Athenians passed a vote to throw Miltiades into\r\nthe Barathrum, and speaks of the interposition of the Prytanis in his\r\nfavour; but it is to be remembered that Plato, with all his transcendent\r\ngenius, was (as Niebuhr has termed him) a very indifferent patriot, who\r\nloved to blacken the character of his country's democratic institutions;\r\nand if the fact was that the Prytanis, at the trial of Miltiades,\r\nopposed the vote of capital punishment, and spoke in favour of the\r\nmilder sentence, Plato (in a passage written to show the misfortunes\r\nthat befell Athenian statesmen) would readily exaggerate this fact into\r\nthe story that appears in his text.]\r\n\r\nThe melancholy end of Miltiades, after his elevation to such a height\r\nof power and glory, must often have been recalled to the mind of the\r\nancient Greeks by the sight of one, in particular, of the memorials of\r\nthe great battle which he won. This was the remarkable statue (minutely\r\ndescribed by Pausanias) which the Athenians, in the time of Pericles,\r\ncaused to be hewn out of a huge block of marble, which, it was believed,\r\nhad been provided by Datis to form a trophy of the anticipated victory\r\nof the Persians. Phidias fashioned out of this a colossal image of the\r\ngoddess Nemesis, the deity whose peculiar function was to visit the\r\nexuberant prosperity both of nations and individuals with sudden and\r\nawful reverses. This statue was placed in a temple of the goddess at\r\nRhamnus, about eight miles from Marathon, Athens herself contained\r\nnumerous memorials of her primary great victory. Panenus, the cousin\r\nof Phidias, represented it in fresco on the walls of the painted porch;\r\nand, centuries afterwards, the figures of Miltiades and Callimachus at\r\nthe head of the Athenians were conspicuous in the fresco. The tutelary\r\ndeities were exhibited taking part in the fray. In the back-ground were\r\nseen the Phoenician galleys; and nearer to the spectator, the Athenians\r\nand the Plataeans (distinguished by their leathern helmets) were chasing\r\nrouted Asiatics into the marshes and the sea. The battle was sculptured\r\nalso on the Temple of Victory in the Acropolis; and even now there may\r\nbe traced on the frieze the figures of the Persian combatants with their\r\nlunar shields, their bows and quivers, their curved scimetars, their\r\nloose trowsers, and Phrygian tiaras. [Wordsworth's \"Greece,\" p. 115.]\r\n\r\nThese and other memorials of Marathon were the produce of the meridian\r\nage of Athenian intellectual splendour--of the age of Phidias and\r\nPericles. For it was not merely by the generation of men whom the battle\r\nliberated from Hippias and the Medes, that the transcendent importance\r\nof their victory was gratefully recognised. Through the whole epoch\r\nof her prosperity, through the long Olympiads of her decay, through\r\ncenturies after her fall, Athens looked back on the day of Marathon as\r\nthe brightest of her national existence.\r\n\r\nBy a natural blending of patriotic pride with grateful piety, the very\r\nspirits of the Athenians who fell at Marathon were deified by their\r\ncountrymen. The inhabitants of the districts of Marathon paid religious\r\nrites to them; and orators solemnly invoked them in their most\r\nimpassioned adjurations before the assembled men of Athens. \"Nothing was\r\nomitted that could keep alive the remembrance of a deed which had first\r\ntaught the Athenian people to know its own strength, by measuring it\r\nwith the power which had subdued the greater part of the known world.\r\nThe consciousness thus awakened fixed its character, its station, and\r\nits destiny; it was the spring of its later great actions and ambitious\r\nenterprises.\" [Thirlwall.]\r\n\r\nIt was not indeed by one defeat, however signal, that the pride of\r\nPersia could be broken, and her dreams of universal empire be dispelled.\r\nTen years afterwards she renewed her attempts upon Europe on a grander\r\nscale of enterprise, and was repulsed by Greece with greater and\r\nreiterated loss. Larger forces and heavier slaughter than had been\r\nseen at Marathon signalised the conflicts of Greeks and Persians\r\nat Artemisium, Salamis, Plataea, and the Eurymedon. But mighty and\r\nmomentous as these battles were, they rank not with Marathon in\r\nimportance. They originated no new impulse. They turned back no current\r\nof fate. They were merely confirmatory of the already existing bias\r\nwhich Marathon had created. The day of Marathon is the critical epoch in\r\nthe history of the two nations. It broke for ever the spell of Persian\r\ninvincibility, which had paralysed men's minds. It generated among\r\nthe Greeks the spirit which beat back Xerxes, and afterwards led on\r\nXenophon, Agesilaus, and Alexander, in terrible retaliation, through\r\ntheir Asiatic campaigns. It secured for mankind the intellectual\r\ntreasures of Athens, the growth of free institutions the liberal\r\nenlightenment of the Western world, and the gradual ascendency for many\r\nages of the great principles of European civilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATORY REMARKS ON SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BATTLE OF\r\nMARATHON.\r\n\r\nNothing is said by Herodotus of the Persian cavalry taking any part in\r\nthe battle, although he mentions that Hippias recommended the Persians\r\nto land at Marathon, because the plain was favourable for cavalry\r\nevolutions. In the life of Miltiades, which is usually cited as the\r\nproduction of Cornelius Nepos, but which I believe to be of no authority\r\nwhatever, it is said that Miltiades protected his flanks from the\r\nenemy's horse by an abattis of felled trees. While he was on the high\r\nground he would not have required this defence; and it is not likely\r\nthat the Persians would have allowed him to erect it on the plain.\r\n\r\nBishop Thirlwall calls our attention to a passage in Suidas, where\r\nthe proverb KHORIS HIPPEIS is said to have originated from some Ionian\r\nGreeks, who were serving compulsorily in the army of Datis, contriving\r\nto inform Miltiades that the Persian cavalry had gone away, whereupon\r\nMiltiades immediately joined battle and gained the victory. There may\r\nprobably be a gleam of truth in this legend. If Datis's cavalry was\r\nnumerous, as the abundant pastures of Euboea were close at hand, the\r\nPersian general, when he thought, from the inaction of his enemy, that\r\nthey did not mean to come down from the heights and give battle, might\r\nnaturally send the larger part of his horse back across the channel to\r\nthe neighbourhood of Eretria, where he had already left a detachment,\r\nand where his military stores must have been deposited. The knowledge of\r\nsuch a movement would of course confirm Miltiades in his resolution to\r\nbring on a speedy engagement.\r\n\r\nBut, in truth, whatever amount of cavalry we suppose Datis to have\r\nhad with him on the day of Marathon, their inaction in the battle is\r\nintelligible, if we believe the attack of the Athenian spearmen to have\r\nbeen as sudden as it was rapid. The Persian horse-soldier, on an alarm\r\nbeing given, had to take the shackles off his horse, to strap the saddle\r\non, and bridle him, besides equipping himself (see Xenoph. Anab. lib.iii\r\nc.4); and when each individual horseman was ready, the line had to be\r\nformed; and the time that it takes to form the Oriental cavalry in line\r\nfor a charge, has, in all ages, been observed by Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe wet state of the marshes at each end of the plain, in the time of\r\nyear when the battle was fought, has been adverted to by Mr Wordsworth;\r\nand this would hinder the Persian general from arranging and employing\r\nhis horsemen on his extreme wings, while it also enabled the Greeks, as\r\nthey came forward, to occupy the whole breadth of the practicable ground\r\nwith an unbroken line of levelled spears, against which, if any Persian\r\nhorse advanced they would be driven back in confusion upon their own\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nEven numerous and fully-arrayed bodies of cavalry have been repeatedly\r\nbroken, both in ancient and modern warfare, by resolute charges of\r\ninfantry. For instance, it was by an attack of some picked cohorts that\r\nCaesar routed the Pompeian cavalry, which had previously defeated his\r\nown at Pharsalia.\r\n\r\nI have represented the battle of Marathon as beginning in the afternoon,\r\nand ending towards evening. If it had lasted all day, Herodotus would\r\nhave probably mentioned that fact. That it ended towards evening is, I\r\nthink, proved by the line from the \"Vespae\" which I have already quoted,\r\nand to which my attention was called by Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton's\r\naccount of the battle. I think that the succeeding lines in\r\nAristophanes, also already quoted, justify the description which I have\r\ngiven of the rear-ranks of the Persians keeping up a flight of arrows\r\nover the heads of their comrades against the Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF EVENTS BETWEEN THE BATTLE OF MARATHON, B.C. 490, AND THE\r\nDEFEAT OF THE ATHENIANS AT SYRACUSE, B.C. 413.\r\n\r\nB.C. 490 to 487. All Asia is filled with the preparations made by King\r\nDarius for a new expedition against Greece. Themistocles persuades the\r\nAthenians to leave off dividing the proceeds of their silver mines among\r\nthemselves, and to employ the money in strengthening their navy.\r\n\r\n487. Egypt revolts from the Persians, and delays the expedition against\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\n485. Darius dies, and Xerxes his son becomes King of Persia in his\r\nstead.\r\n\r\n484 The Persians recover Egypt.\r\n\r\n480 Xerxes invades Greece. Indecisive actions between the Persian and\r\nGreek fleets at Artemisium. Destruction of the three hundred Spartans\r\nat Thermopyae. The Athenians abandon Attica and go on shipboard. Great\r\nnaval victory of the Greeks at Salamis. Xerxes returns to Asia, leaving\r\na chosen army under Mardonius, to carry on the war against the Greeks.\r\n\r\n478. Mardonius and his army destroyed by the Greeks at Plataea The\r\nGreeks land in Asia Minor, and defeat a Persian force at Mycale. In this\r\nand the following years the Persians lose all their conquests in Europe,\r\nand many on the coast of Asia.\r\n\r\n477. Many of the Greek maritime states take Athens as their leader,\r\ninstead of Sparta.\r\n\r\n466. Victories of Cimon over the Persians at the Eurymedon.\r\n\r\n464. Revolt of the Helots against Sparta. Third Messenian war.\r\n\r\n460. Egypt again revolts against Persia. The Athenians send a powerful\r\narmament to aid the Egyptians, which, after gaining some successes, is\r\ndestroyed, and Egypt submits. This war lasted six years.\r\n\r\n457. Wars in Greece between the Athenian and several Peloponnesian\r\nstates. Immense exertions of Athens at this time. There is an original\r\ninscription still preserved in the Louvre, which attests the energies of\r\nAthens at this crisis, when Athens, like England in modern wars, at once\r\nsought conquests abroad, and repelled enemies at home. At the period we\r\nnow advert to (B.C. 457), an Athenian armament of two hundred galleys\r\nwas engaged in a bold though unsuccessful expedition against Egypt. The\r\nAthenian crews had landed, had won a battle; they had then re-embarked\r\nand sailed up the Nile, and were busily besieging the Persian garrison\r\nin Memphis. As the complement of a trireme galley was at least two\r\nhundred men, we cannot estimate the forces then employed by Athens\r\nagainst Egypt at less than forty thousand men. At the same time she kept\r\nsquadrons on the coasts of Phoenicia and Cyprus, and yet maintained\r\na home-fleet that enabled her to defeat her Peloponnesian enemies\r\nat Cecryphalae and AEgina, capturing in the last engagement seventy\r\ngalleys. This last fact may give us some idea of the strength of the\r\nAthenian home-fleet that gained the victory; and by adopting the same\r\nratio of multiplying whatever number of galleys we suppose to have been\r\nemployed, by two hundred, so as to gain the aggregate number of the\r\ncrews, we may form some estimate of the forces which this little, Greek\r\nstate then kept on foot. Between sixty and seventy thousand men must\r\nhave served in her fleets during that year. Her tenacity of purpose was\r\nequal to her boldness of enterprise. Sooner than yield or withdraw from\r\nany of their expeditions the Athenians at this very time, when Corinth\r\nsent an army to attack their garrison at Megara, did not recall a single\r\ncrew or a single soldier from AEgina or from abroad; but the lads and\r\nold men, who had been left to guard the city, fought and won a battle\r\nagainst these new assailants. The inscription which we have referred to\r\nis graven on a votive tablet to the memory of the dead, erected in that\r\nyear by the Erecthean tribe, one of the ten into which the Athenians\r\nwere divided. It shows, as Thirlwall has remarked, \"that the Athenians\r\nwere conscious of the greatness of their own effort;\" and in it this\r\nlittle civic community of the ancient world still \"records to us with\r\nemphatic simplicity, that 'its slain fell in Cyprus, in Egypt, in\r\nPhoenicia, at Haliae, in AEgina, and in Megara, IN THE SAME YEAR.'\"\r\n[Paeans of the Athenian Navy.]\r\n\r\n455. A thirty years' truce concluded between Athens and Lacedaemon.\r\n\r\n440. The Samians endeavour to throw off the supremacy of Athens. Samos\r\ncompletely reduced to subjection. Pericles is now sole director of the\r\nAthenian councils.\r\n\r\n431. Commencement of the great Peloponnesian war, in which Sparta,\r\nat the head of nearly all the Peloponnesian states, and aided by the\r\nBoeotians and some of the other Greeks beyond the Isthmus, endeavours\r\nto reduce the power of Athens, and to restore independence to the\r\nGreek maritime states who were the subject allies of Athens. At the\r\ncommencement of the war the Peloponnesian armies repeatedly invade and\r\nravage Attica, but Athens herself is impregnable, and her fleets secure\r\nher the dominion of the sea.\r\n\r\n430. Athens visited by a pestilence, which sweeps off large numbers of\r\nher population.\r\n\r\n426. The Athenians gain great advantages over the Spartans at\r\nSphacteria, and by occupying Cythera; but they suffer a severe defeat\r\nin Boeotia, and the Spartan general Brasidas, leads an expedition to\r\nthe Thracian coasts, and conquers many of the most valuable Athenian\r\npossessions in those regions.\r\n\r\n421. Nominal truce for thirty years between Athens and Sparta, but\r\nhostilities continue on the Thracian coast and in other quarters.\r\n\r\n415. The Athenians send an expedition to conquer Sicily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. -- DEFEAT OF THE ATHENIANS AT SYRACUSE, B.C.413.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The Romans knew not, and could not know, how deeply the\r\n  greatness of their own posterity, and the fate of the whole\r\n  Western world, were involved in the destruction of the fleet of\r\n  Athens in the harbour of Syracuse.  Had that great expedition\r\n  proved victorious, the energies of Greece during the next\r\n  eventful century would have found their field in the West no less\r\n  than in the East; Greece, and not Rome, might have conquered\r\n  Carthage; Greek instead of Latin might have been at this day the\r\n  principal element of the language of Spain, of France, and of\r\n  Italy; and the laws of Athens, rather than of Rome, might be the\r\n  foundation of the law of the civilized world.\"--ARNOLD.\r\n\r\n  \"The great expedition to Sicily, one of the most decisive events in\r\n  the history of the world.\"--NIEBUHR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew cities have undergone more memorable sieges during ancient and\r\nmediaeval times, than has the city of Syracuse. Athenian, Carthaginian,\r\nRoman, Vandal, Byzantine, Saracen, and Norman, have in turns beleaguered\r\nher walls; and the resistance which she successfully opposed to some\r\nof her early assailants was of the deepest importance, not only to the\r\nfortunes of the generations then in being, but to all the subsequent\r\ncurrent of human events. To adopt the eloquent expressions of Arnold\r\nrespecting the check which she gave to the Carthaginian arms, \"Syracuse\r\nwas a breakwater, which God's providence raised up to protect the yet\r\nimmature strength of Rome.\" And her triumphant repulse of the great\r\nAthenian expedition against her was of even more wide-spread and\r\nenduring importance. It forms a decisive epoch in the strife\r\nfor universal empire, in which all the great states of antiquity\r\nsuccessively engaged and failed.\r\n\r\nThe present city of Syracuse is a place of little or no military\r\nstrength, as the fire of artillery from the neighbouring heights would\r\nalmost completely command it. But in ancient warfare its position, and\r\nthe care bestowed on its walls, rendered it formidably strong against\r\nthe means of offence which then were employed by besieging armies.\r\n\r\nThe ancient city, in the time of the Peloponnesian war, was chiefly\r\nbuilt on the knob of land which projects into the sea on the eastern\r\ncoast of Sicily, between two bays; one of which, to the north, was\r\ncalled the bay of Thapsus, while the southern one formed the great\r\nharbour of the city of Syracuse itself. A small island, or peninsula\r\n(for such it soon was rendered), lies at the south-eastern extremity of\r\nthis knob of land, stretching almost entirely across the mouth of\r\nthe great harbour, and rendering it nearly land-locked. This island\r\ncomprised the original settlement of the first Greek colonists from\r\nCorinth, who founded Syracuse two thousand five hundred years ago; and\r\nthe modern city has shrunk again into these primary limits. But, in the\r\nfifth century before our era, the growing wealth and population of the\r\nSyracusans had led them to occupy and include within their city walls\r\nportion after portion of the mainland lying next to the little isle; so\r\nthat at the time of the Athenian expedition the seaward part of the land\r\nbetween the two bays already spoken of was built over, and fortified\r\nfrom bay to bay; constituting the larger part of Syracuse.\r\n\r\nThe landward wall, therefore, of the city traversed this knob of land,\r\nwhich continues to slope upwards from the sea, and which to the west of\r\nthe old fortifications (that is, towards the interior of Sicily)\r\nrises rapidly for a mile or two, but diminishes in width, and finally\r\nterminates in a long narrow ridge, between which and Mount Hybla a\r\nsuccession of chasms and uneven low ground extend. On each flank of\r\nthis ridge the descent is steep and precipitous from its summits to\r\nthe strips of level land that lie immediately below it, both to the\r\nsouth-west and north-west.\r\n\r\nThe usual mode of assailing fortified towns in the time of the\r\nPeloponnesian war, was to build a double wall round them, sufficiently\r\nstrong to check any sally of the garrison from within, or any attack of\r\na relieving force from without. The interval within the two walls of\r\nthe circumvallation was roofed over, and formed barracks, in which\r\nthe besiegers posted themselves, and awaited the effects of want or\r\ntreachery among the besieged in producing a surrender. And, in every\r\nGreek city of those days, as in every Italian republic of the middle\r\nages, the rage of domestic sedition between aristocrats and democrats\r\nran high. Rancorous refugees swarmed in the camp of every invading\r\nenemy; and every blockaded city was sure to contain within its walls\r\na body of intriguing malcontents, who were eager to purchase a\r\nparty-triumph at the expense of a national disaster. Famine and faction\r\nwere the allies on whom besiegers relied. The generals of that time\r\ntrusted to the operation of these sure confederates as soon as they\r\ncould establish a complete blockade. They rarely ventured on the attempt\r\nto storm any fortified post. For the military engines of antiquity were\r\nfeeble in breaching masonry, before the improvements which the first\r\nDionysius effected in the mechanics of destruction; and the lives of\r\nspearmen the boldest and most highly-trained would, of course, have been\r\nidly spent in charges against unshattered walls.\r\n\r\nA city built, close to the sea, like Syracuse, was impregnable, save\r\nby the combined operations of a superior hostile fleet and a superior\r\nhostile army. And Syracuse, from her size, her population, and her\r\nmilitary and naval resources, not unnaturally thought herself secure\r\nfrom finding in another Greek city a foe capable of sending a sufficient\r\narmament to menace her with capture and subjection. But in the spring of\r\n414 B.C. the Athenian navy was mistress of her harbour and the adjacent\r\nseas; an Athenian army had defeated her troops, and cooped them within\r\nthe town; and from bay to bay a blockading wall was being rapidly\r\ncarried across the strips of level ground and the high ridge outside\r\nthe city (then termed Epipolae), which, if completed, would have cut the\r\nSyracusans off from all succour from the interior of Sicily, and have\r\nleft them at the mercy of the Athenian generals. The besiegers' works\r\nwere, indeed, unfinished; but every day the unfortified interval in\r\ntheir lines grew narrower, and with it diminished all apparent hope of\r\nsafety for the beleaguered town.\r\n\r\nAthens was now staking the flower of her forces, and the accumulated\r\nfruits of seventy years of glory, on one bold throw for the dominion of\r\nthe Western world. As Napoleon from Mount Coeur de Lion pointed to St.\r\nJean d'Acre, and told his staff that the capture of that town would\r\ndecide his destiny, and would change the face of the world; so the\r\nAthenian officers, from the heights of Epipolae, must have looked on\r\nSyracuse, and felt that with its fall all the known powers of the\r\nearth would fall beneath them. They must have felt also that Athens, if\r\nrepulsed there, must pause for ever in her career of conquest, and sink\r\nfrom an imperial republic into a ruined and subservient community.\r\n\r\nAt Marathon, the first in date of the Great Battles of the World, we\r\nbeheld Athens struggling for self-preservation against the invading\r\narmies of the East. At Syracuse she appears as the ambitious and\r\noppressive invader of others. In her, as in other republics of old\r\nand of modern times, the same energy that had inspired the most heroic\r\nefforts in defence of the national independence, soon learned to employ\r\nitself in daring and unscrupulous schemes of self-aggrandizement at the\r\nexpense of neighbouring nations. In the interval between the Persian and\r\nPeloponnesian wars she had rapidly grown into a conquering and dominant\r\nstate, the chief of a thousand tributary cities, and the mistress of the\r\nlargest and best-manned navy that the Mediterranean had yet beheld.\r\nThe occupations of her territory by Xerxes and Mardonius, in the second\r\nPersian war, had forced her whole population to become mariners; and the\r\nglorious results of that struggle confirmed them in their zeal for their\r\ncountry's service at sea. The voluntary suffrage of the Greek cities of\r\nthe coasts and islands of the AEgean first placed Athens at the head of\r\nthe confederation formed for the further prosecution of the war against\r\nPersia. But this titular ascendancy was soon converted by her into\r\npractical and arbitrary dominion. She protected them from piracy and\r\nthe Persian power, which soon fell into decrepitude and decay; but\r\nshe exacted in return implicit obedience to herself. She claimed and\r\nenforced a prerogative of taxing them at her discretion; and proudly\r\nrefused to be accountable for her mode of expending their supplies.\r\nRemonstrance against her assessments was treated as factious disloyalty;\r\nand refusal to pay was promptly punished as revolt. Permitting and\r\nencouraging her subject allies to furnish all their contingents in\r\nmoney, instead of part consisting of ships and men, the sovereign\r\nrepublic gained the double object of training her own citizens by\r\nconstant and well-paid service in her fleets, and of seeing her\r\nconfederates lose their skill and discipline by inaction, and become\r\nmore and more passive and powerless under her yoke. Their towns were\r\ngenerally dismantled; while the imperial city herself was fortified with\r\nthe greatest care and sumptuousness: the accumulated revenues from her\r\ntributaries serving to strengthen and adorn to the utmost her havens,\r\nher docks, her arsenals, her theatres, and her shrines; and to array\r\nher in that plenitude of architectural magnificence, the ruins of which\r\nstill attest the intellectual grandeur of the age and people, which\r\nproduced a Pericles to plan and a Phidias to execute.\r\n\r\nAll republics that acquire supremacy over other nations, rule them\r\nselfishly and oppressively. There is no exception to this in either\r\nancient or modern times. Carthage, Rome, Venice, Genoa, Florence, Pisa,\r\nHolland, and Republican France, all tyrannized over every province\r\nand subject state where they gained authority. But none of them openly\r\navowed their system of doing so upon principle, with the candour which\r\nthe Athenian republicans displayed, when any remonstrance was made\r\nagainst the severe exactions which they imposed upon their vassal\r\nallies. They avowed that their empire was a tyranny, and frankly stated\r\nthat they solely trusted to force and terror to uphold it. They appealed\r\nto what they called \"the eternal law of nature, that the weak should be\r\ncoerced by the strong.\" [THUC. i. 77.] Sometimes they stated, and not\r\nwithout some truth, that the unjust hatred of Sparta against themselves\r\nforced them to be unjust to others in self-defence. To be safe they\r\nmust be powerful; and to be powerful they must plunder and coerce their\r\nneighbours. They never dreamed of communicating any franchise, or share\r\nin office, to their dependents; but jealously monopolized every post of\r\ncommand, and all political and judicial power; exposing themselves to\r\nevery risk with unflinching gallantry; enduring cheerfully the laborious\r\ntraining and severe discipline which their sea-service required;\r\nventuring readily on every ambitious scheme; and never suffering\r\ndifficulty or disaster to shake their tenacity of purpose. Their hope\r\nwas to acquire unbounded empire for their country, and the means\r\nof maintaining each of the thirty thousand citizens who made up the\r\nsovereign republic, in exclusive devotion to military occupations, and\r\nto those brilliant sciences and arts in which Athens already had reached\r\nthe meridian of intellectual splendour.\r\n\r\nHer great political, dramatist speaks of the Athenian empire as\r\ncomprehending a thousand states. The language of the stage must not be\r\ntaken too literally; but the number of the dependencies of Athens,\r\nat the time when the Peloponnesian confederacy attacked her, was\r\nundoubtedly very great. With a few trifling exceptions, all the islands\r\nof the AEgean, and all the Greek cities, which in that age fringed the\r\ncoasts of Asia Minor, the Hellespont, and Thrace paid tribute to Athens,\r\nand implicitly obeyed her orders. The AEgean Sea was an Attic lake.\r\nWestward of Greece, her influence though strong, was not equally\r\npredominant. She had colonies and allies among the wealthy and populous\r\nGreek settlements in Sicily and South Italy, but she had no organized\r\nsystem of confederates in those regions; and her galleys brought her no\r\ntribute from the western seas. The extension of her empire over Sicily\r\nwas the favourite project of her ambitious orators and generals. While\r\nher great statesman Pericles lived, his commanding genius kept his\r\ncountrymen under control and forbade them to risk the fortunes of Athens\r\nin distant enterprises, while they had unsubdued and powerful enemies at\r\ntheir own doors. He taught Athens this maxim; but he also taught her\r\nto know and to use her own strength, and when Pericles had departed the\r\nbold spirit which he had fostered overleaped the salutary limits which\r\nhe had prescribed. When her bitter enemies, the Corinthians, succeeded,\r\nin 431 B.C., in inducing Sparta to attack her, and a confederacy was\r\nformed of five-sixths of the continental Greeks, all animated by anxious\r\njealousy and bitter hatred of Athens; when armies far superior in\r\nnumbers and equipment to those which had marched against the Persians\r\nwere poured into the Athenian territory, and laid it waste to the city\r\nwalls; the general opinion was that Athens would, in two or three\r\nyears at the farthest, be reduced to submit to the requisitions of\r\nher invaders. But her strong fortifications, by which she was girt and\r\nlinked to her principal haven, gave her, in those ages, almost all the\r\nadvantages of an insular position. Pericles had made her trust to her\r\nempire of the seas. Every Athenian in those days was a practised seaman.\r\nA state indeed whose members, of an age fit for service, at no time\r\nexceeded thirty thousand, and whose territorial extent did not equal\r\nhalf Sussex, could only have acquired such a naval dominion as Athens\r\nonce held, by devoting, and zealously training, all its sons to service\r\nin its fleets. In order to man the numerous galleys which she sent out,\r\nshe necessarily employed also large numbers of hired mariners and slaves\r\nat the oar; but the staple of her crews was Athenian, and all posts of\r\ncommand were held by native citizens. It was by reminding them of this,\r\nof their long practice in seamanship, and the certain superiority which\r\ntheir discipline gave them over the enemy's marine, that their great\r\nminister mainly encouraged them to resist the combined power of\r\nLacedaemon and her allies. He taught them that Athens might thus reap\r\nthe fruit of her zealous devotion to maritime affairs ever since the\r\ninvasion of the Medes; \"she had not, indeed, perfected herself; but\r\nthe reward of her superior training was the rule of the sea--a mighty\r\ndominion, for it gave her the rule of much fair land beyond its waves,\r\nsafe from the idle ravages with which the Lacedaemonians might harass\r\nAttica, but never could subdue Athens.\" [THUC. lib. i. sec. 144.]\r\n\r\nAthens accepted the war with which her enemies threatened her, rather\r\nthan descend from her pride of place. And though the awful visitation of\r\nthe Plague came upon her, and swept away more of her citizens than the\r\nDorian spear laid low, she held her own gallantly against her foes. If\r\nthe Peloponnesian armies in irresistible strength wasted every spring\r\nher corn lands, her vineyards, and her olive groves with fire and sword,\r\nshe retaliated on their coasts with her fleets; which, if resisted,\r\nwere only resisted to display the pre-eminent skill and bravery of her\r\nseamen. Some of her subject-allies revolted, but the revolts were in\r\ngeneral sternly and promptly quelled. The genius of one enemy had,\r\nindeed, inflicted blows on her power in Thrace which she was unable to\r\nremedy; but he fell in battle in the tenth year of the war; and with the\r\nloss of Brasidas the Lacedaemonians seemed to have lost all energy and\r\njudgment. Both sides at length grew weary of the war; and in 421 B.C. a\r\ntruce of fifty years was concluded, which, though ill kept, and\r\nthough many of the confederates of Sparta refused to recognise it,\r\nand hostilities still continued in many parts of Greece, protected the\r\nAthenian territory from the ravages of enemies, and enabled Athens to\r\naccumulate large sums out of the proceeds of her annual revenues. So\r\nalso, as a few years passed by, the havoc which the pestilence and the\r\nsword had made in her population was repaired; and in 415 B.C. Athens\r\nwas full of bold and restless spirits, who longed for some field\r\nof distant enterprise, wherein they might signalize themselves, and\r\naggrandize the state; and who looked on the alarm of Spartan hostility\r\nas a mere old woman's tale. When Sparta had wasted their territory she\r\nhad done her worst; and the fact of its always being in her power to\r\ndo so, seemed a strong reason for seeking to increase the transmarine\r\ndominion of Athens.\r\n\r\nThe West was now the quarter towards which the thoughts of every\r\naspiring Athenian were directed. From the very beginning of the war\r\nAthens had kept up an interest in Sicily; and her squadrons had from\r\ntime to time appeared on its coasts and taken part in the dissensions\r\nin which the Sicilian Greeks were universally engaged one against the\r\nother. There were plausible grounds for a direct quarrel, and an open\r\nattack by the Athenians upon Syracuse.\r\n\r\nWith the capture of Syracuse all Sicily, it was hoped, would be secured.\r\nCarthage and Italy were next to be assailed. With large levies of\r\nIberian mercenaries she then meant to overwhelm her Peloponnesian\r\nenemies. The Persian monarchy lay in hopeless imbecility, inviting Greek\r\ninvasion; nor did the known world contain the power that seemed capable\r\nof checking the growing might of Athens, if Syracuse once could be hers.\r\n\r\nThe national historian of Rome has left us, as an episode of his great\r\nwork, a disquisition on the probable effects that would have followed,\r\nif Alexander the Great had invaded Italy. Posterity has generally\r\nregarded that disquisition as proving Livy's patriotism more\r\nstrongly than his impartiality or acuteness. Yet, right or wrong, the\r\nspeculations of the Roman writer were directed to the consideration of\r\na very remote possibility. To whatever age Alexander's life might have\r\nbeen prolonged, the East would have furnished full occupation for his\r\nmartial ambition, as well as for those schemes of commercial grandeur\r\nand imperial amalgamation of nations, in which the truly great\r\nqualities of his mind loved to display themselves. With his death the\r\ndismemberment of his empire among his generals was certain, even as the\r\ndismemberment of Napoleon's empire among his marshals would certainly\r\nhave ensued, if he had been cut off in the zenith of his power. Rome,\r\nalso, was far weaker when the Athenians were in Sicily, than she was a\r\ncentury afterwards, in Alexander's time. There can be little doubt but\r\nthat Rome would have been blotted out from the independent powers of the\r\nWest, had she been attacked at the end of the fifth century B.C., by an\r\nAthenian army, largely aided by Spanish mercenaries, and flushed with\r\ntriumphs over Sicily and Africa; instead of the collision between\r\nher and Greece having been deferred until the latter had sunk into\r\ndecrepitude, and the Roman Mars had grown into full vigour.\r\n\r\nThe armament which the Athenians equipped against Syracuse was in every\r\nway worthy of the state which formed such projects of universal empire;\r\nand it has been truly termed \"the noblest that ever yet had been sent\r\nforth by a free and civilized commonwealth.\" [Arnold's History of Rome.]\r\nThe fleet consisted of one hundred and thirty-four war galleys, with\r\na multitude of store ships. A powerful force of the best heavy-armed\r\ninfantry that Athens and her allies could furnish was sent on board,\r\ntogether with a smaller number of slingers and bowmen. The quality\r\nof the forces was even more remarkable than the number. The zeal of\r\nindividuals vied with that of the republic in giving every galley the\r\nbest possible crew, and every troop the most perfect accoutrements. And\r\nwith private as well as public wealth eagerly lavished on all that could\r\ngive splendour as well as efficiency to the expedition, the fated fleet\r\nbegan its voyage for the Sicilian shores in the summer of 415 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe Syracusans themselves, at the time of the Peloponnesian war, were a\r\nbold and turbulent democracy, tyrannizing over the weaker Greek\r\ncities in Sicily, and trying to gain in that island the same arbitrary\r\nsupremacy which Athens maintained along the eastern coast of the\r\nMediterranean. In numbers and in spirit they were fully equal to the\r\nAthenians, but far inferior to them in military and naval discipline.\r\nWhen the probability of an Athenian invasion was first publicly\r\ndiscussed at Syracuse, and efforts were made by some of the wiser\r\ncitizens to improve the state of the national defences, and prepare for\r\nthe impending danger, the rumours of coming war and the proposals for\r\npreparation were received by the mass of the Syracusans with scornful\r\nincredulity. The speech of one of their popular orators is preserved to\r\nus in Thucydides, [Lib. vi. sec. 36 et seq., Arnold's edition. I have\r\nalmost literally transcribed some of the marginal epitomes of the\r\noriginal speech.] and many of its topics might, by a slight alteration\r\nof names and details, serve admirably for the party among ourselves at\r\npresent which opposes the augmentation of our forces, and derides\r\nthe idea of our being in any peril from the sudden attack of a French\r\nexpedition. The Syracusan orator told his countrymen to dismiss\r\nwith scorn the visionary terrors which a set of designing men among\r\nthemselves strove to excite, in order to get power and influence thrown\r\ninto their own hands. He told them that Athens knew her own interest\r\ntoo well to think of wantonly provoking their hostility:--\"EVEN IF THE\r\nENEMIES WERE TO COME,\" said he, \"SO DISTANT FROM THEIR RESOURCES, AND\r\nOPPOSED TO SUCH A POWER AS OURS, THEIR DESTRUCTION WOULD BE EASY AND\r\nINEVITABLE. THEIR SHIPS WILL HAVE ENOUGH TO DO TO GET TO OUR ISLAND\r\nAT ALL, AND TO CARRY SUCH STORES OF ALL SORTS AS WILL BE NEEDED. THEY\r\nCANNOT THEREFORE CARRY, BESIDES, AN ARMY LARGE ENOUGH TO COPE WITH SUCH\r\nA POPULATION AS OURS. THEY WILL HAVE NO FORTIFIED PLACE FROM WHICH TO\r\nCOMMENCE THEIR OPERATIONS; BUT MUST REST THEM ON NO BETTER BASE THAN A\r\nSET OF WRETCHED TENTS, AND SUCH MEANS AS THE NECESSITIES OF THE MOMENT\r\nWILL ALLOW THEM. BUT IN TRUTH I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD EVEN BE\r\nABLE TO EFFECT A DISEMBARKATION. LET US, THEREFORE, SET AT NOUGHT THESE\r\nREPORTS AS ALTOGETHER OF HOME MANUFACTURE; AND BE SURE THAT IF ANY ENEMY\r\nDOES COME, THE STATE WILL KNOW HOW TO DEFEND ITSELF IN A MANNER WORTHY\r\nOF THE NATIONAL HONOUR.\"\r\n\r\nSuch assertions pleased the Syracusan assembly; and their counterparts\r\nfind favour now among some portion of the English public. But the\r\ninvaders of Syracuse came; made good their landing in Sicily; and, if\r\nthey had promptly attacked the city itself, instead of wasting nearly\r\na year in desultory operations in other parts of the island, the\r\nSyracusans must have paid the penalty of their self-sufficient\r\ncarelessness in submission to the Athenian yoke. But, of the three\r\ngenerals who led the Athenian expedition, two only were men of ability,\r\nand one was most weak and incompetent. Fortunately for Syracuse,\r\nAlcibiades, the most skilful of the three, was soon deposed from his\r\ncommand by a factious and fanatic vote of his fellow-countrymen, and\r\nthe other competent one, Lamachus, fell early in a skirmish: while, more\r\nfortunately still for her, the feeble and vacillating Nicias remained\r\nunrecalled and unhurt, to assume the undivided leadership of the\r\nAthenian army and fleet, and to mar, by alternate over-caution and\r\nover-carelessness, every chance of success which the early part of the\r\noperations offered. Still, even under him, the Athenians nearly won the\r\ntown. They defeated the raw levies of the Syracusans, cooped them\r\nwithin the walls, and, as before mentioned, almost effected a continuous\r\nfortification from bay to bay over Epipolae, the completion of which\r\nwould certainly have been followed by capitulation.\r\n\r\nAlcibiades, the most complete example of genius without principle that\r\nhistory produces, the Bolingbroke of antiquity, but with high military\r\ntalents superadded to diplomatic and oratorical powers, on being\r\nsummoned home from his command in Sicily to take his trial before the\r\nAthenian tribunal had escaped to Sparta; and he exerted himself there\r\nwith all the selfish rancour of a renegade to renew the war with Athens,\r\nand to send instant assistance to Syracuse.\r\n\r\nWhen we read his words in the pages of Thucydides (who was himself an\r\nexile from Athens at this period, and may probably have been at Sparta,\r\nand heard Alcibiades speak), we are at loss whether most to admire or\r\nabhor his subtile and traitorous counsels. After an artful exordium,\r\nin which he tried to disarm the suspicions which he felt must be\r\nentertained of him, and to point out to the Spartans how completely his\r\ninterests and theirs were identified, through hatred of the Athenian\r\ndemocracy, he thus proceeded:--\"Hear me, at any rate, on the matters\r\nwhich require your grave attention, and which I, from the personal\r\nknowledge that I have of them, can and ought to bring before you. We\r\nAthenians sailed to Sicily with the design of subduing, first the Greek\r\ncities there, and next those in Italy. Then we intended to make an\r\nattempt on the dominions of Carthage, and on Carthage itself. [Arnold,\r\nin his notes on this passage, well reminds the reader that Agathocles,\r\nwith a Greek force far inferior to that of the Athenians at this period,\r\ndid, a century afterwards, very nearly conquer Carthage.] If all\r\nthese projects succeeded (nor did we limit ourselves to them in these\r\nquarters), we intended to increase our fleet with the inexhaustible\r\nsupplies of ship timber which Italy affords, to put in requisition the\r\nwhole military force of the conquered Greek states, and also to hire\r\nlarge armies of the barbarians; of the Iberians, and others in those\r\nregions, who are allowed to make the best possible soldiers. [It will\r\nbe remembered that Spanish infantry were the staple of the Carthaginian\r\narmies. Doubtless Alcibiades and other leading Athenians had made\r\nthemselves acquainted with the Carthaginian system of carrying on war,\r\nand meant to adopt it. With the marvellous powers which Alcibiades\r\npossessed of ingratiating himself with men of every class and every\r\nnation, and his high military genius, he would have been as formidable a\r\nchief of an army of CONDOTTIERI as Hannibal afterwards was.] Then,\r\nwhen we had done all this, we intended to assail Peloponnesus with our\r\ncollected force. Our fleets would blockade you by sea, and desolate your\r\ncoasts; our armies would be landed at different points, and assail your\r\ncities. Some of these we expected to storm and others we meant to take\r\nby surrounding them with fortified lines. [Alcibiades here alluded to\r\nSparta itself, which was unfortified. His Spartan hearers must have\r\nglanced round them at these words, with mixed alarm and indignation.] We\r\nthought that it would thus be an easy matter thoroughly to war you down;\r\nand then we should become the masters of the whole Greek race. As for\r\nexpense, we reckoned that each conquered state would give us supplies of\r\nmoney and provisions sufficient to pay for its own conquest, and furnish\r\nthe means for the conquest of its neighbours.\r\n\r\n\"Such are the designs of the present Athenian expedition to Sicily, and\r\nyou have heard them from the lips of the man who, of all men living, is\r\nmost accurately acquainted with them. The other Athenian generals, who\r\nremain with the expedition, will endeavour to carry out these plans.\r\nAnd be sure that without your speedy interference they will all be\r\naccomplished. The Sicilian Greeks are deficient in military training;\r\nbut still if they could be at once brought to combine in an organised\r\nresistance to Athens, they might even now be saved. But as for the\r\nSyracusans resisting Athens by themselves, they have already with the\r\nwhole strength of their population fought a battle and been beaten; they\r\ncannot face the Athenians at sea; and it is quite impossible for them\r\nto hold out against the force of their invaders. And if this city falls\r\ninto the hands of the Athenians, all Sicily is theirs, and presently\r\nItaly also: and the danger which I warned you of from that quarter will\r\nsoon fall upon yourselves. You must, therefore, in Sicily fight for the\r\nsafety of Peloponnesus. Send some galleys thither instantly. Put men on\r\nboard who can work their own way over, and who, as soon as they land,\r\ncan do duty as regular troops. But above all, let one of yourselves, let\r\na man of Sparta, go over to take the chief command, to bring into order\r\nand effective discipline the forces that are in Syracuse, and urge\r\nthose, who at present hang back to come forward and aid the Syracusans.\r\nThe presence of a Spartan general at this crisis will do more to save\r\nthe city than a whole army.\" [THUC., lib. vi sec. 90,91.] The renegade\r\nthen proceeded to urge on them the necessity of encouraging their\r\nfriends in Sicily, by showing that they themselves were earnest in\r\nhostility to Athens. He exhorted them not only to march their armies\r\ninto Attica again, but to take up a permanent fortified position in\r\nthe country: and he gave them in detail information of all that the\r\nAthenians most dreaded, and how his country might receive the most\r\ndistressing and enduring injury at their hands.\r\n\r\nThe Spartans resolved to act on his advice, and appointed Gylippus to\r\nthe Sicilian command. Gylippus was a man who, to the national bravery\r\nand military skill of a Spartan, united political sagacity that was\r\nworthy of his great fellow-countryman Brasidas; but his merits were\r\ndebased by mean and sordid vice; and his is one of the cases in which\r\nhistory has been austerely just, and where little or no fame has been\r\naccorded to the successful but venal soldier. But for the purpose for\r\nwhich he was required in Sicily, an abler man could not have been found\r\nin Lacedaemon. His country gave him neither men nor money, but she gave\r\nhim her authority; and the influence of her name and of his own talents\r\nwas speedily seen in the zeal with which the Corinthians and other\r\nPeloponnesian Greeks began to equip a squadron to act under him for the\r\nrescue of Sicily. As soon as four galleys were ready, he hurried over\r\nwith them to the southern coast of Italy; and there, though he received\r\nsuch evil tidings of the state of Syracuse that he abandoned all hope of\r\nsaving that city, he determined to remain on the coast, and do what he\r\ncould in preserving the Italian cities from the Athenians.\r\n\r\nSo nearly, indeed, had Nicias completed his beleaguering lines, and so\r\nutterly desperate had the state of Syracuse seemingly become, that\r\nan assembly of the Syracusans was actually convened, and they were\r\ndiscussing the terms on which they should offer to capitulate, when\r\na galley was seen dashing into the great harbour, and making her way\r\ntowards the town with all the speed that her rowers could supply. From\r\nher shunning the part of the harbour where the Athenian fleet lay, and\r\nmaking straight for the Syracusan side, it was clear that she was a\r\nfriend; the enemy's cruisers, careless through confidence of success,\r\nmade no attempt to cut her off; she touched the beach, and a Corinthian\r\ncaptain springing on shore from her, was eagerly conducted to the\r\nassembly of the Syracusan people, just in time to prevent the fatal vote\r\nbeing put for a surrender.\r\n\r\nProvidentially for Syracuse, Gongylus, the commander of the galley, had\r\nbeen prevented by an Athenian squadron from following Gylippus to South\r\nItaly, and he had been obliged to push direct for Syracuse from Greece.\r\n\r\nThe sight of actual succour, and the promise of more, revived the\r\ndrooping spirits of the Syracusans. They felt that they were not left\r\ndesolate to perish; and the tidings that a Spartan was coming to command\r\nthem confirmed their resolution to continue their resistance. Gylippus\r\nwas already near the city. He had learned at Locri that the first report\r\nwhich had reached him of the state of Syracuse was exaggerated; and that\r\nthere was an unfinished space in the besiegers' lines through which it\r\nwas barely possible to introduce reinforcements into the town. Crossing\r\nthe straits of Messina, which the culpable negligence of Nicias had left\r\nunguarded, Gylippus landed on the northern coast of Sicily, and there\r\nbegan to collect from the Greek cities an army, of which the regular\r\ntroops that he brought from Peloponnesus formed the nucleus. Such was\r\nthe influence of the name of Sparta, [The effect of the presence of a\r\nSpartan officer on the troops of the other Greeks, seems to have been\r\nlike the effect of the presence of an English officer upon native Indian\r\ntroops.] and such were his own abilities and activity, that he succeeded\r\nin raising a force of about two thousand fully armed infantry, with a\r\nlarger number of irregular troops. Nicias, as if infatuated, made no\r\nattempt to counteract his operations; nor, when Gylippus marched his\r\nlittle army towards Syracuse, did the Athenian commander endeavour\r\nto check him. The Syracusans marched out to meet him: and while the\r\nAthenians were solely intent on completing their fortifications on the\r\nsouthern side towards the harbour, Gylippus turned their position by\r\noccupying the high ground in the extreme rear of Epipolae. He then\r\nmarched through the unfortified interval of Nicias's lines into the\r\nbesieged town; and, joining his troops with the Syracusan forces, after\r\nsome engagements with varying success, gained the mastery over\r\nNicias, drove the Athenians from Epipolae, and hemmed them into a\r\ndisadvantageous position in the low grounds near the great harbour.\r\n\r\nThe attention of all Greece was now fixed on Syracuse; and every enemy\r\nof Athens felt the importance of the opportunity now offered of checking\r\nher ambition, and, perhaps, of striking a deadly blow at her power.\r\nLarge reinforcements from Corinth, Thebes, and other cities, now reached\r\nthe Syracusans; while the baffled and dispirited Athenian general\r\nearnestly besought his countrymen to recall him, and represented the\r\nfurther prosecution of the siege as hopeless.\r\n\r\nBut Athens had made it a maxim never to let difficulty or disaster drive\r\nher back from any enterprise once undertaken, so long as she\r\npossessed the means of making any effort, however desperate, for its\r\naccomplishment. With indomitable pertinacity she now decreed, instead of\r\nrecalling her first armament from before Syracuse, to send out a second,\r\nthough her enemies near home had now renewed open warfare against\r\nher, and by occupying a permanent fortification in her territory, had\r\nseverely distressed her population, and were pressing her with almost\r\nall the hardships of an actual siege. She still was mistress of the sea,\r\nand she sent forth another fleet of seventy galleys, and another army,\r\nwhich seemed to drain the very last reserves of her military population,\r\nto try if Syracuse could not yet be won, and the honour of the Athenian\r\narms be preserved from the stigma of a retreat. Hers was, indeed, a\r\nspirit that might be broken, but never would bend. At the head of this\r\nsecond expedition she wisely placed her best general Demosthenes, one\r\nof the most distinguished officers whom the long Peloponnesian war had\r\nproduced, and who, if he had originally held the Sicilian command, would\r\nsoon have brought Syracuse to submission.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Demosthenes the general, has been dimmed by the superior\r\nlustre of his great countryman, Demosthenes the orator. When the name of\r\nDemosthenes is mentioned, it is the latter alone that is thought of. The\r\nsoldier has found no biographer. Yet out of the long list of the great\r\nmen of the Athenian republic, there are few that deserve to stand higher\r\nthan this brave, though finally unsuccessful, leader of her fleets and\r\narmies in the first half of the Peloponnesian war. In his first campaign\r\nin AEtolia he had shown some of the rashness of youth, and had received\r\na lesson of caution, by which he profited throughout the rest of his\r\ncareer, but without losing any of his natural energy in enterprise or\r\nin execution. He had performed the eminent service of rescuing Naupactus\r\nfrom a powerful hostile armament in the seventh year of the war; he had\r\nthen, at the request of the Acarnanian republics, taken on himself the\r\noffice of commander-in-chief of all their forces, and at their head\r\nhe had gained some important advantages over the enemies of Athens in\r\nWestern Greece. His most celebrated exploits had been the occupation\r\nof Pylos on the Messenian coast, the successful defence of that place\r\nagainst the fleet and armies of Lacedaemon, and the subsequent capture\r\nof the Spartan forces on the isle of Sphacteria; which was the severest\r\nblow dealt to Sparta throughout the war, and which had mainly caused\r\nher to humble herself to make the truce with Athens. Demosthenes was\r\nas honourably unknown in the war of party politics at Athens, as he was\r\neminent in the war against the foreign enemy. We read of no intrigues of\r\nhis on either the aristocratic or democratic side. He was neither in the\r\ninterest of Nicias, nor of Cleon. His private character was free from\r\nany of the stains which polluted that of Alcibiades. On all these points\r\nthe silence of the comic dramatist is decisive evidence in his favour.\r\nHe had also the moral courage, not always combined with physical of\r\nseeking to do his duty to his country, irrespectively of any odium that\r\nhe himself might incur, and unhampered by any petty jealousy of those\r\nwho were associated with him in command. There are few men named in\r\nancient history, of whom posterity would gladly know more, or whom we\r\nsympathise with more deeply in the calamities that befel them, than\r\nDemosthenes, the son of Alcisthenes, who, in the spring of the year 413\r\nB.C., left Piraeus at the head of the second Athenian expedition against\r\nSicily.\r\n\r\nHis arrival was critically timed; for Gylippus had encouraged the\r\nSyracusans to attack the Athenians under Nicias by sea as well as by\r\nland, and by an able stratagem of Ariston, one of the admirals of the\r\nCorinthian auxiliary squadron, the Syracusans and their confederates had\r\ninflicted on the fleet of Nicias the first defeat that the Athenian\r\nnavy had ever sustained from a numerically inferior foe. Gylippus was\r\npreparing to follow up his advantage by fresh attacks on the Athenians\r\non both elements, when the arrival of Demosthenes completely changed the\r\naspect of affairs, and restored the superiority to the invaders. With\r\nseventy-three war-galleys in the highest state of efficiency, and\r\nbrilliantly equipped, with a force of five thousand picked men of the\r\nregular infantry of Athens and her allies, and a still larger number of\r\nbowmen, javelin-men, and slingers on board, Demosthenes rowed round the\r\ngreat harbour with loud cheers and martial music, as if in defiance of\r\nthe Syracusans and their confederates. His arrival had indeed changed\r\ntheir newly-born hopes into the deepest consternation. The resources of\r\nAthens seemed inexhaustible, and resistance to her hopeless. They had\r\nbeen told that she was reduced to the last extremities, and that her\r\nterritory was occupied by an enemy; and yet, here they saw her, as if in\r\nprodigality of power, sending forth, to make foreign conquests, a second\r\narmament, not inferior to that with which Nicias had first landed on the\r\nSicilian shores.\r\n\r\nWith the intuitive decision of a great commander, Demosthenes at once\r\nsaw that the possession of Epipolae was the key to the possession of\r\nSyracuse, and he resolved to make a prompt and vigorous attempt\r\nto recover that position, while his force was unimpaired, and the\r\nconsternation which its arrival had produced among the besieged remained\r\nunabated. The Syracusans and their allies had run out an outwork along\r\nEpipolae from the city walls, intersecting the fortified lines of\r\ncircumvallation which Nicias had commenced, but from which they had been\r\ndriven by Gylippus. Could Demosthenes succeed in storming this outwork,\r\nand in re-establishing the Athenian troops on the high ground, he might\r\nfairly hope to be able to resume the circumvallation of the city, and\r\nbecome the conqueror of Syracuse: for, when once the besiegers' lines\r\nwere completed, the number of the troops with which Gylippus had\r\ngarrisoned the place would only tend to exhaust the stores of\r\nprovisions, and accelerate its downfall.\r\n\r\nAn easily-repelled attack was first made on the outwork in the day-time,\r\nprobably more with the view of blinding the besieged to the nature of\r\nthe main operations than with any expectation of succeeding in an open\r\nassault, with every disadvantage of the ground to contend against. But,\r\nwhen the darkness had set in, Demosthenes formed his men in columns,\r\neach soldier taking with him five days' provisions, and the engineers\r\nand workmen of the camp following the troops with their tools, and\r\nall portable implements of fortification, so as at once to secure\r\nany advantage of ground that the army might gain. Thus equipped and\r\nprepared, he led his men along by the foot of the southern flank of\r\nEpipolae, in a direction towards the interior of the island, till he\r\ncame immediately below the narrow ridge that forms the extremity of the\r\nhigh ground looking westward. He then wheeled his vanguard to the right,\r\nsent them rapidly up the paths that wind along the face of the cliff,\r\nand succeeded in completely surprising the Syracusan outposts, and in\r\nplacing his troops fairly on the extreme summit of the all-important\r\nEpipolae. Thence the Athenians marched eagerly down the slope towards\r\nthe town, routing some Syracusan detachments that were quartered in\r\ntheir way, and vigorously assailing the unprotected part of the outwork.\r\nAll at first favoured them. The outwork was abandoned by its garrison,\r\nand the Athenian engineers began to dismantle it. In vain Gylippus\r\nbrought up fresh troops to check the assault: the Athenians broke and\r\ndrove them back, and continued to press hotly forward, in the full\r\nconfidence of victory. But, amid the general consternation of the\r\nSyracusans and their confederates, one body of infantry stood firm. This\r\nwas a brigade of their Boeotian allies, which was posted low down the\r\nslope of Epipolae, outside the city walls. Coolly and steadily the\r\nBoeotian infantry formed their line, and, undismayed by the current of\r\nflight around them, advanced against the advancing Athenians. This was\r\nthe crisis of the battle. But the Athenian van was disorganized by its\r\nown previous successes; and, yielding to the unexpected charge thus made\r\non it by troops in perfect order, and of the most obstinate courage, it\r\nwas driven back in confusion upon the other divisions of the army that\r\nstill continued to press forward. When once the tide was thus turned,\r\nthe Syracusans passed rapidly from the extreme of panic to the extreme\r\nof vengeful daring, and with all their forces they now fiercely assailed\r\nthe embarrassed and receding Athenians. In vain did the officers of the\r\nlatter strive to re-form their line. Amid the din and the shouting\r\nof the fight, and the confusion inseparable upon a night engagement,\r\nespecially one where many thousand combatants were pent and whirled\r\ntogether in a narrow and uneven area, the necessary manoeuvres were\r\nimpracticable; and though many companies still fought on desperately,\r\nwherever the moonlight showed them the semblance of a foe, [THUC. vii.\r\n44. Compare Tacitus's description of the night engagement in the civil\r\nwar between Vespasian and Vitellius: \"Neutro inclinaverat fortuna, donec\r\nadulta nocte, LUNA OSTENDERET ACIES, FALERESQUE.\"--Hist. Lib. iii. sec.\r\n23.] they fought without concert or subordination; and not unfrequently,\r\namid the deadly chaos, Athenian troops assailed each other. Keeping\r\ntheir ranks close, the Syracusans and their allies pressed on against\r\nthe disorganized masses of the besiegers; and at length drove them, with\r\nheavy slaughter, over the cliffs, which, scarce an hour before, they had\r\nscaled full of hope, and apparently certain of success.\r\n\r\nThis defeat was decisive of the event of the siege. The Athenians\r\nafterwards struggled only to protect themselves from the vengeance which\r\nthe Syracusans sought to wreak in the complete destruction of their\r\ninvaders. Never, however, was vengeance more complete and terrible.\r\nA series of sea-fights followed, in which the Athenian galleys were\r\nutterly destroyed or captured. The mariners and soldiers who escaped\r\ndeath in disastrous engagements, and in a vain: attempt to force a\r\nretreat into the interior of the island, became prisoners of war. Nicias\r\nand Demosthenes were put to death in cold blood; and their men either\r\nperished miserably in the Syracusan dungeons, or were sold into slavery\r\nto the very persons whom, in their pride of power, they had crossed the\r\nseas to enslave.\r\n\r\nAll danger from Athens to the independent nations of the West was now\r\nfor ever at an end. She, indeed, continued to struggle against her\r\ncombined enemies and revolted allies with unparalleled gallantry; and\r\nmany more years of varying warfare passed away before she surrendered\r\nto their arms. But no success in subsequent conquests could ever have\r\nrestored her to the pre-eminence in enterprise, resources, and maritime\r\nskill which she had acquired before her fatal reverses in Sicily. Nor\r\namong the rival Greek republics, whom her own rashness aided to crush\r\nher, was there any capable of reorganizing her empire, or resuming her\r\nschemes of conquest. The dominion of Western Europe was left for Rome\r\nand Carthage to dispute two centuries later, in conflicts still more\r\nterrible, and with even higher displays of military daring and genius,\r\nthan Athens had witnessed either in her rise, her meridian, or her fall.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF THE EVENTS BETWEEN THE DEFEAT OF THE ATHENIANS AT SYRACUSE,\r\nAND THE BATTLE OF ARBELA.\r\n\r\n412 B.C. Many of the subject allies of Athens revolt from her, on her\r\ndisasters before Syracuse being known; the seat of war is transferred to\r\nthe Hellespont and eastern side of the AEgean.\r\n\r\n410. The Carthaginians attempt to make conquests in Sicily.\r\n\r\n407. Cyrus the Younger is sent by the king of Persia to take the\r\ngovernment of all the maritime parts of Asia Minor, and with orders to\r\nhelp the Lacedaemonian fleet against the Athenian.\r\n\r\n406. Agrigentum taken by the Carthaginians.\r\n\r\n405. The last Athenian fleet destroyed by Lysander at AEgospotamos.\r\nAthens closely besieged. Rise of the power of Dionysius at Syracuse.\r\n\r\n404. Athens surrenders. End of the Peloponnesian war. The ascendancy of\r\nSparta complete throughout Greece.\r\n\r\n403. Thrasybulus, aided by the Thebans and with the connivance of one\r\nof the Spartan kings, liberates Athens from the Thirty Tyrants, and\r\nrestores the democracy.\r\n\r\n401. Cyrus the Younger commences his expedition into Upper Asia to\r\ndethrone his brother Artaxerxes Mnemon. He takes with him an auxiliary\r\nforce of ten thousand Greeks. He in killed in battle at Cunaxa; and\r\nthe ten thousand, led by Xenophon, effect their retreat in spite of the\r\nPersian armies and the natural obstacles of their march.\r\n\r\n399. In this, and the five following years, the Lacedaemonians under\r\nAgesilaus and other commanders, carry on war against the Persian satraps\r\nin Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n396. Syracuse is besieged by the Carthaginians, and successfully\r\ndefended by Dionysius.\r\n\r\n394. Rome makes her first great stride in the career of conquest by the\r\ncapture of Veii.\r\n\r\n393. The Athenian admiral Conon, in conjunction with the Persian satrap\r\nPharnabazus, defeats the Lacedaemonian fleet off Cnidus, and restores\r\nthe fortifications of Athens. Several of the former allies of Sparta in\r\nGreece carry on hostilities against her.\r\n\r\n388. The nations of Northern Europe now first appear in authentic\r\nhistory. The Gauls overrun great part of Italy, and burn Rome. Rome\r\nrecovers from the blow, but her old enemies, the AEquians and Volscians,\r\nare left completely crushed by the Gallic invaders.\r\n\r\n387. The peace of Antalcidas is concluded among the Greeks by the\r\nmediation, and under the sanction, of the Persian king.\r\n\r\n378 to 361. Fresh wars in Greece. Epaminondas raises Thebes to be the\r\nleading state of Greece, and the supremacy of Sparta is destroyed at\r\nthe battle of Leuctra. Epaminondas is killed in gaining the victory of\r\nMantinea, and the power of Thebes falls with him. The Athenians attempt\r\na balancing system between Sparta and Thebes.\r\n\r\n359. Philip becomes king of Macedon.\r\n\r\n357. The Social War breaks out in Greece, and lasts three years. Its\r\nresult checks the attempt of Athens to regain her old maritime empire.\r\n\r\n356. Alexander the Great is born.\r\n\r\n343. Rome begins her wars with the Samnites: they extend over a period\r\nof fifty years. The result of this obstinate contest is to secure for\r\nher the dominion of Italy.\r\n\r\n340. Fresh attempts of the Carthaginians upon Syracuse. Timoleon defeats\r\nthem with great slaughter.\r\n\r\n338. Philip defeats the confederate armies of Athens and Thebes\r\nat Chaeronea, and the Macedonian supremacy over Greece is firmly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n336. Philip is assassinated, and Alexander the Great becomes king of\r\nMacedon.

Alexander passes the Hellespont.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. -- THE BATTLE OF ARBELA, B.C. 331.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Alexander deserves the glory which he has enjoyed for so\r\n     many centuries and among all nations; but what if he had\r\n     been beaten at Arbela having the Euphrates, the Tigris, and\r\n     the deserts in his rear, without any strong places of\r\n     refuge, nine hundred leagues from Macedonia?\"--NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Asia beheld with astonishment and awe the uninterrupted\r\n     progress of a hero, the sweep of whose conquests was as wide\r\n     and rapid as that of her own barbaric kings, or the Scythian\r\n     or Chaldaean hordes; but, far unlike the transient\r\n     whirlwinds of Asiatic warfare, the advance of the Macedonian\r\n     leader was no less deliberate than rapid; at every step the\r\n     Greek power took root, and the language and the civilization\r\n     of Greece were planted from the shores of the AEgean to the\r\n     banks of the Indus, from the Caspian and the great Hyrcanian\r\n     plain to the cataracts of the Nile; to exist actually for\r\n     nearly a thousand years, and in their effects to endure for\r\n     ever.\"--ARNOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nA long and not uninstructive list might be made out of illustrious\r\nmen, whose characters have been vindicated during recent times from\r\naspersions which for centuries had been thrown on them. The spirit of\r\nmodern inquiry, and the tendency of modern scholarship, both of which\r\nare often said to be solely negative and destructive, have, in truth,\r\nrestored to splendour, and almost created anew, far more than they have\r\nassailed with censure, or dismissed from consideration as unreal. The\r\ntruth of many a brilliant narrative of brilliant exploits has of\r\nlate years been triumphantly demonstrated; and the shallowness of the\r\nsceptical scoffs with which little minds have carped at the great minds\r\nof antiquity, has been in many instances decisively exposed. The laws,\r\nthe politics, and the lines of action adopted or recommended by eminent\r\nmen and powerful nations have been examined with keener investigation,\r\nand considered with more comprehensive judgment, than formerly were\r\nbrought to bear on these subjects. The result has been at least as often\r\nfavourable as unfavourable to the persons and the states so scrutinized;\r\nand many an oft-repeated slander against both measures and men has thus\r\nbeen silenced, we may hope, for ever.\r\n\r\nThe veracity of Herodotus, the pure patriotism of Pericles, of\r\nDemosthenes, and of the Gracchi, the wisdom of Cleisthenes and of\r\nLicinius as constitutional reformers, may be mentioned as facts which\r\nrecent writers have cleared from unjust suspicion and censure. And it\r\nmight be easily shown that the defensive tendency which distinguishes\r\nthe present and recent best historians of Germany, France, and England,\r\nhas been equally manifested in the spirit in which they have treated the\r\nheroes of thought and the heroes of action who lived during what we\r\nterm the Middle Ages and whom it was so long the fashion to sneer at or\r\nneglect.\r\n\r\nThe name of the victor of Arbela has led to these reflections; for,\r\nalthough the rapidity and extent of Alexander's conquests have through\r\nall ages challenged admiration and amazement, the grandeur of genius\r\nwhich he displayed in his schemes of commerce, civilization, and of\r\ncomprehensive union and unity amongst nations, has, until lately, been\r\ncomparatively unhonoured. This long-continued depreciation was of early\r\ndate. The ancient rhetoricians--a class of babblers, a school for lies\r\nand scandal, as Niebuhr justly termed them--chose among the stock themes\r\nfor their commonplaces, the character and exploits of Alexander. They\r\nhad their followers in every age; and until a very recent period,\r\nall who wished to \"point a moral or adorn a tale\" about unreasoning\r\nambition, extravagant pride, and the formidable frenzies of free will\r\nwhen leagued with free power, have never failed to blazon forth the\r\nso-called madman of Macedonia as one of the most glaring examples.\r\nWithout doubt, many of these writers adopted with implicit credence\r\ntraditional ideas and supposed, with uninquiring philanthropy, that in\r\nblackening Alexander they were doing humanity good service. But also,\r\nwithout doubt, many of his assailants, like those of other great men,\r\nhave been mainly instigated by \"that strongest of all antipathies, the\r\nantipathy of a second-rate mind to a first-rate one,\" [De Stael.] and by\r\nthe envy which talent too often bears to genius.\r\n\r\nArrian, who wrote his history of Alexander when Hadrian was emperor of\r\nthe Roman world, and when the spirit of declamation and dogmatism was at\r\nits full height, but who was himself, unlike the dreaming pedants of the\r\nschools, a statesman and a soldier of practical and proved ability, well\r\nrebuked the malevolent aspersions which he heard continually thrown upon\r\nthe memory of the great conqueror of the East. He truly says, \"Let the\r\nman who speaks evil of Alexander not merely bring forward those passages\r\nof Alexander's life which were really evil, but let him collect and\r\nreview all the actions of Alexander, and then let him thoroughly\r\nconsider first who and what manner of man he himself is, and what has\r\nbeen his own career; and then let him consider who and what manner of\r\nman Alexander was, and to what an eminence of human grandeur HE arrived.\r\nLet him consider that Alexander was a king, and the undisputed lord of\r\nthe two continents; and that his name is renowned throughout the whole\r\nearth. Let the evil-speaker against Alexander bear all this in mind, and\r\nthen let him reflect on his own insignificance, the pettiness of his own\r\ncircumstances and affairs, and the blunders that he makes about these,\r\npaltry and trifling as they are. Let him then ask himself whether he is\r\na fit person to censure and revile such a man as Alexander. I believe\r\nthat there was in his time no nation of men, no city, nay, no single\r\nindividual, with whom Alexander's name had not become a familiar word. I\r\ntherefore hold that such a man, who was like no ordinary mortal was not\r\nborn into the world without some special providence.\" [Arrian, lib. vii.\r\nAD FINEM.]\r\n\r\nAnd one of the most distinguished soldiers and writers of our own\r\nnation, Sir Walter Raleigh, though he failed to estimate justly the full\r\nmerits of Alexander, has expressed his sense of the grandeur of the part\r\nplayed in the world by \"The Great Emathian Conqueror\" in language that\r\nwell deserves quotation:--\"So much hath the spirit of some one man\r\nexcelled as it hath undertaken and effected the alteration of the\r\ngreatest states and commonwealths, the erection of monarchies, the\r\nconquest of kingdoms and empires, guided handfuls of men against\r\nmultitudes of equal bodily strength, contrived victories beyond all\r\nhope and discourse of reason, converted the fearful passions of his\r\nown followers into magnanimity, and the valour of his enemies into\r\ncowardice; such spirits have been stirred up in sundry ages of the\r\nworld, and in divers parts thereof, to erect and cast down again, to\r\nestablish and to destroy, and to bring all things, persons, and states\r\nto the same certain ends, which the infinite spirit of the UNIVERSAL,\r\npiercing, moving, and governing all things, hath ordained. Certainly,\r\nthe things that this king did were marvellous, and would hardly have\r\nbeen undertaken by any one else: and though his father had determined\r\nto have invaded the Lesser Asia, it is like that he would have contented\r\nhimself with some part thereof, and not have discovered the river of\r\nIndus, as this man did.\" [\"The Historie of the World,\" by Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh, Knight, p. 628.]\r\n\r\nA higher authority than either Arrian or Raleigh may now be referred to\r\nby those who wish to know the real merit of Alexander as a general, and\r\nhow far the commonplace assertions are true, that his successes were the\r\nmere results of fortunate rashness and unreasoning pugnacity, Napoleon\r\nselected Alexander as one of the seven greatest generals whose noble\r\ndeeds history has handed down to us, and from the study of whose\r\ncampaigns the principles of war are to be learned. The critique of the\r\ngreatest conqueror of modern times on the military career of the great\r\nconqueror of the old world, is no less graphic than true.\r\n\r\n\"Alexander crossed the Dardanelles 334 B.C. with an army of about forty\r\nthousand men, of which one-eighth was cavalry; he forced the passage\r\nof the Granicus in opposition to an army under Memnon, the Greek, who\r\ncommanded for Darius on the coast of Asia, and he spent the whole of the\r\nyear 333 in establishing his power in Asia Minor. He was seconded by the\r\nGreek colonists, who dwelt on the borders of the Black Sea, and on the\r\nMediterranean, and in Smyrna, Ephesus, Tarsus, Miletus, &c. The kings of\r\nPersia left their provinces and towns to be governed according to their\r\nown particular laws. Their empire was a union of confederated states,\r\nand did not form one nation; this facilitated its conquest. As Alexander\r\nonly wished for the throne of the monarch, he easily effected the\r\nchange, by respecting the customs, manners, and laws of the people, who\r\nexperienced no change in their condition.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 332, he met with Darius at the head of sixty thousand men,\r\nwho had taken up a position near Tarsus, on the banks of the Issus, in\r\nthe province of Cilicia. He defeated him, entered Syria, took Damascus,\r\nwhich contained all the riches of the Great King, and laid siege to\r\nTyre. This superb metropolis of the commerce of the world detained\r\nhim nine months. He took Gaza after a siege of two months; crossed\r\nthe Desert in seven days; entered Pelusium and Memphis, and founded\r\nAlexandria. In less than two years, after two battles and four or five\r\nsieges, the coasts of the Black Sea from Phasis to Byzantium, those\r\nof the Mediterranean as far as Alexandria, all Asia Minor, Syria, and\r\nEgypt, had submitted to his arms.\r\n\r\n\"In 331, he repassed the Desert, encamped in Tyre, recrossed Syria,\r\nentered Damascus, passed the Euphrates and Tigris, and defeated Darius\r\non the field of Arbela, when he was at the head of a still stronger army\r\nthan that which he commanded on the Issus, and Babylon opened her gates\r\nto him. In 330, he overran Susa, and took that city, Persepolis, and\r\nPasargada, which contained the tomb of Cyrus. In 329, he directed his\r\ncourse northward, entered Ecbatana, and extended his conquests to the\r\ncoasts of the Caspian, punished Bessus, the cowardly assassin of Darius,\r\npenetrated into Scythia, and subdued the Scythians. In 328, he forced\r\nthe passage of the Oxus, received sixteen thousand recruits from\r\nMacedonia, and reduced the neighbouring people to subjection. In 327,\r\nhe crossed the Indus, vanquished Poros in a pitched battle, took him\r\nprisoner, and treated him as a king. He contemplated passing the Ganges,\r\nbut his army refused. He sailed down the Indus, in the year 326, with\r\neight hundred vessels; having arrived at the ocean, he sent Nearchus\r\nwith a fleet to run along the coasts of the Indian Ocean and the Persian\r\nGulf, as far as the mouth of the Euphrates. In 325, he took sixty days\r\nin crossing from Gedrosia, entered Keramania, returned to Pasargada,\r\nPersepolis, and Susa, and married Statira, the daughter of Darius. In\r\n324, he marched once more to the north, passed Ecbatana, and terminated\r\nhis career at Babylon.\" [See Count Montolon's Memoirs of Napoleon.]\r\n\r\nThe enduring importance of Alexander's conquests is to be estimated not\r\nby the duration of his own life and empire, or even by the duration\r\nof the kingdoms which his generals after his death formed out of the\r\nfragments of that mighty dominion. In every region of the world that he\r\ntraversed, Alexander planted Greek settlements, and founded cities,\r\nin the populations of which the Greek element at once asserted its\r\npredominance. Among his successors, the Seleucids and the Ptolemies\r\nimitated their great captain in blending schemes of civilization, of\r\ncommercial intercourse, and of literary and scientific research with all\r\ntheir enterprises of military aggrandizement, and with all their systems\r\nof civil administration. Such was the ascendancy of the Greek genius, so\r\nwonderfully comprehensive and assimilating was the cultivation which\r\nit introduced, that, within thirty years after Alexander crossed the\r\nHellespont, the language, the literature, and the arts of Hellas,\r\nenforced and promoted by the arms of semi-Hellenic Macedon, predominated\r\nin every country from the shores of that sea to the Indian waters. Even\r\nsullen Egypt acknowledged the intellectual supremacy of Greece; and the\r\nlanguage of Pericles and Plato became the language of the statesmen\r\nand the sages who dwelt in the mysterious land of the Pyramids and the\r\nSphinx. It is not to be supposed that this victory of the Greek tongue\r\nwas so complete as to exterminate the Coptic, the Syrian, the Armenian,\r\nthe Persian, or the other native languages of the numerous nations and\r\ntribes between the AEgean, the Iaxertes, the Indus, and the Nile; they\r\nsurvived as provincial dialects. Each probably was in use as the vulgar\r\ntongue of its own district. But every person with the slightest pretence\r\nto education spoke Greek. Greek was universally the State language, and\r\nthe exclusive language of all literature and science, It formed also\r\nfor the merchant, the trader, and the traveller, as well as for the\r\ncourtier, the government official, and the soldier, the organ of\r\nintercommunication among the myriads of mankind inhabiting these large\r\nportions of the Old World. [See Arnold, Hist. Rome, ii. 406.] Throughout\r\nAsia Minor, Syria, and Egypt, the Hellenic character that was thus\r\nimparted, remained in full vigour down to the time of the Mahometan\r\nconquests. The infinite value of this to humanity in the highest and\r\nholiest point of view has often been pointed out; and the workings of\r\nthe finger of Providence have been gratefully recognised by those who\r\nhave observed how the early growth and progress of Christianity\r\nwere aided by that diffusion of the Greek language and civilization\r\nthroughout Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt which had been caused by the\r\nMacedonian conquest of the East.\r\n\r\nIn Upper Asia, beyond the Euphrates, the direct and material influence\r\nof Greek ascendancy was more short-lived. Yet, during the existence of\r\nthe Hellenic kingdoms in these regions, especially of the Greek kingdom\r\nof Bactria, the modern Bokhara, very important effects were produced\r\non the intellectual tendencies and tastes of the inhabitants of those\r\ncountries and of the adjacent ones, by the animating contact of the\r\nGrecian spirit. Much of Hindoo science and philosophy, much of the\r\nliterature of the later Persian kingdom of the Arsacidae, either\r\noriginated from, or was largely modified by, Grecian influences. So,\r\nalso, the learning and science of the Arabians were in a far less degree\r\nthe result of original invention and genius, than the reproduction, in\r\nan altered form, of the Greek philosophy and the Greek lore, acquired\r\nby the Saracenic conquerors together with their acquisition of the\r\nprovinces which Alexander had subjugated nearly a thousand years before\r\nthe armed disciples of Mahomet commenced their career in the East. It is\r\nwell known that Western Europe in the Middle ages drew its philosophy,\r\nits arts, and its science, principally from Arabian teachers. And thus\r\nwe see how the intellectual influence of ancient Greece, poured on the\r\nEastern world by Alexander's victories, and then brought back to bear on\r\nMediaeval Europe by the spread of the Saracenic powers, has exerted its\r\naction on the elements of modern civilization by this powerful though\r\nindirect channel as well as by the more obvious effects of the remnants\r\nof classic civilization which survived in Italy, Gaul, Britain, and\r\nSpain, after the irruption of the Germanic nations. [See Humboldt's\r\nCosmos.]\r\n\r\nThese considerations invest the Macedonian triumphs in the East with\r\nnever-dying interest, such as the most showy and sanguinary successes of\r\nmere \"low ambition and the pride of kings,\" however they may dazzle\r\nfor a moment, can never retain with posterity. Whether the old Persian\r\nempire, which Cyrus founded, could have survived much longer than\r\nit did, even if Darius had been victorious at Arbela, may safely be\r\ndisputed. That ancient dominion, like the Turkish at the present time,\r\nlaboured under every cause of decay and dissolution. The satraps, like\r\nthe modern pachas, continually rebelled against the central power,\r\nand Egypt, in particular, was almost always in a state of insurrection\r\nagainst its nominal sovereign. There was no longer any effective central\r\ncontrol, or any internal principle of unity fused through the huge mass\r\nof the empire, and binding it together. Persia was evidently about to\r\nfall; but, had it not been for Alexander's invasion of Asia, she would\r\nmost probably have fallen beneath some other Oriental power, as Media\r\nand Babylon had formerly fallen before herself, and as, in after times,\r\nthe Parthian supremacy gave way to the revived ascendancy of Persia in\r\nthe East, under the sceptres of the Arsacidae. A revolution that merely\r\nsubstituted one Eastern power for another would have been utterly barren\r\nand unprofitable to mankind.\r\n\r\nAlexander's victory at Arbela not only overthrew an Oriental dynasty,\r\nbut established European rulers in its stead. It broke the monotony,\r\nof the Eastern world by the impression of Western energy and superior\r\ncivilization; even as England's present mission is to break up the\r\nmental and moral stagnation of India and Cathay, by pouring upon and\r\nthrough them the impulsive current of Anglo-Saxon commerce and conquest.\r\n\r\nArbela, the city which has furnished its name to the decisive battle\r\nthat gave Asia to Alexander, lies more than twenty miles from the actual\r\nscene of conflict. The little village then named Gaugamela is close to\r\nthe spot where the armies met, but has ceded the honour of naming the\r\nbattle to its more euphonious neighbour. Gaugamela is situate in one\r\nof the wide plains that lie between the Tigris and the mountains of\r\nKurdistan. A few undulating hillocks diversify the surface of this sandy\r\ntrack; but the ground is generally level, and admirably qualified for\r\nthe evolutions of cavalry, and also calculated to give the larger of\r\ntwo armies the full advantage of numerical superiority. The Persian King\r\n(who before he came to the throne, had proved his personal valour as a\r\nsoldier, and his skill as a general) had wisely selected this region for\r\nthe third and decisive encounter between his forces and the invaders.\r\nThe previous defeats of his troops, however severe they had been,\r\nwere not looked on as irreparable, The Granicus had been fought by his\r\ngenerals rashly and without mutual concert. And, though Darius himself\r\nhad commanded and been beaten at Issus, that defeat might be attributed\r\nto the disadvantageous nature of the ground; where, cooped up between\r\nthe mountains, the river, and the sea, the numbers of the Persians\r\nconfused and clogged alike the general's skill and the soldiers'\r\nprowess, so that their very strength became their weakness. Here, on the\r\nbroad plains of Kurdistan, there was scope for Asia's largest host\r\nto array its lines, to wheel, to skirmish, to condense or expand its\r\nsquadrons, to manoeuvre, and to charge at will. Should Alexander and\r\nhis scanty band dare to plunge into that living sea of war, their\r\ndestruction seemed inevitable.\r\n\r\nDarius felt, however, the critical nature to himself as well as to his\r\nadversary of the coming encounter. He could not hope to retrieve the\r\nconsequences of a third overthrow. The great cities of Mesopotamia and\r\nUpper Asia, the central provinces of the Persian empire, were certain\r\nto be at the mercy of the victor. Darius knew also the Asiatic character\r\nwell enough to be aware how it yields to the prestige of success, and\r\nthe apparent career of destiny. He felt that the diadem was now either\r\nto be firmly replaced on his own brow, or to be irrevocably transferred\r\nto the head of his European conqueror. He, therefore, during the\r\nlong interval left him after the battle of Issus, while Alexander was\r\nsubjugating Syria and Egypt, assiduously busied himself in selecting the\r\nbest troops which his vast empire supplied, and in training his varied\r\nforces to act together with some uniformity of discipline and system.\r\n\r\nThe hardy mountaineers of Affghanistan, Bokhara, Khiva, and Thibet, were\r\nthen, as at present, far different from the generality of Asiatics in\r\nwarlike spirit and endurance. From these districts Darius collected\r\nlarge bodies of admirable infantry; and the countries of the modern\r\nKurds and Turkomans supplied, as they do now, squadrons of horsemen,\r\nstrong, skilful, bold, and trained to a life of constant activity and\r\nwarfare. It is not uninteresting to notice that the ancestors of our\r\nown late enemies, the Sikhs, served as allies of Darius against the\r\nMacedonians. They are spoken of in Arrian as Indians who dwelt near\r\nBactria. They were attached to the troops of that satrapy, and their\r\ncavalry was one of the most formidable forces in the whole Persian army.\r\n\r\nBesides these picked troops, contingents also came in from the numerous\r\nother provinces that yet obeyed the Great King. Altogether, the horse\r\nare said to have been forty thousand, the scythe-bearing chariots two\r\nhundred, and the armed elephants fifteen in number. The amount of the\r\ninfantry is uncertain; but the knowledge which both ancient and modern\r\ntimes supply of the usual character of Oriental armies, and of their\r\npopulations of camp-followers, may warrant us in believing that many\r\nmyriads were prepared to fight, or to encumber those who fought, for the\r\nlast Darius.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Persian king near Mesopotamia was chosen with great\r\nmilitary skill. It was certain that Alexander on his return from Egypt\r\nmust march northward along the Syrian coast, before he attacked the\r\ncentral provinces of the Persian empire. A direct eastward march from\r\nthe lower part of Palestine across the great Syrian Desert was then,\r\nas now, utterly impracticable. Marching eastward from Syria, Alexander\r\nwould, on crossing the Euphrates, arrive at the vast Mesopotamian\r\nplains. The wealthy capitals of the empire, Babylon, Susa, and\r\nPersepolis, would then lie to his south; and if he marched down through\r\nMesopotamia to attack them, Darius might reasonably hope to follow the\r\nMacedonians with his immense force of cavalry, and, without even risking\r\na pitched battle, to harass and finally overwhelm them. We may remember\r\nthat three centuries afterwards a Roman army under Crassus was thus\r\nactually destroyed by the Oriental archers and horsemen in these very\r\nplains; [See Mitford.] and that the ancestors of the Parthians who thus\r\nvanquished the Roman legions, served by thousands under King Darius. If,\r\non the contrary, Alexander should defer his march against Babylon, and\r\nfirst seek an encounter with the Persian army, the country on each side\r\nof the Tigris in this latitude was highly advantageous for such an\r\narmy as Darius commanded; and he had close in his rear the mountainous\r\ndistricts of Northern Media, where he himself had in early life been\r\nsatrap, where he had acquired reputation as a soldier and a general,\r\nand where he justly expected to find loyalty to his person, and a safe\r\nrefuge in case of defeat. [Mitford's remarks on the strategy of Darius\r\nin his last campaign are very just. After having been unduly admired as\r\nan historian, Mitford is now unduly neglected. His partiality, and his\r\ndeficiency in scholarship, have been exposed sufficiently to make him no\r\nlonger a dangerous guide as to Greek polities; while the clearness and\r\nbrilliancy of his narrative, and the strong common sense of his remarks\r\n(where his party prejudices do not interfere) must always make his\r\nvolumes valuable as well as entertaining.]\r\n\r\nHis great antagonist came on across the Euphrates against him, at the\r\nhead of an army which Arrian, copying from the journals of Macedonian\r\nofficers, states to have consisted of forty thousand foot, and seven\r\nthousand horse. In studying the campaigns of Alexander, we possess the\r\npeculiar advantage of deriving our information from two of Alexander's\r\ngenerals of division, who bore an important part in all his enterprises.\r\nAristobulus and Ptolemy (who afterwards became king of Egypt) kept\r\nregular journals of the military events which they witnessed; and these\r\njournals were in the possession of Arrian, when he drew up his history\r\nof Alexander's expedition. The high character of Arrian for integrity\r\nmakes us confident that he used them fairly, and his comments on the\r\noccasional discrepancies between the two Macedonian narratives prove\r\nthat he used them sensibly. He frequently quotes the very words of his\r\nauthorities: and his history thus acquires a charm such as very few\r\nancient or modern military narratives possess. The anecdotes and\r\nexpressions which he records we fairly believe to be genuine, and not\r\nto be the coinage of a rhetorician, like those in Curtius. In fact, in\r\nreading Arrian, we read General Aristobulus and General Ptolemy on the\r\ncampaigns of the Macedonians; and it is like reading General Jomini or\r\nGeneral Foy on the campaigns of the French.\r\n\r\nThe estimate which we find in Arrian of the strength of Alexander's\r\narmy, seems reasonable when we take into account both the losses which\r\nhe had sustained, and the reinforcements which he had received since he\r\nleft Europe. Indeed, to Englishmen, who know with what mere handfuls of\r\nmen our own generals have, at Plassy, at Assaye, at Meeanee, and other\r\nIndian battles, routed large hosts of Asiatics, the disparity of\r\nnumbers that we read of in the victories won by the Macedonians over the\r\nPersians presents nothing incredible. The army which Alexander now led\r\nwas wholly composed of veteran troops in the highest possible state of\r\nequipment and discipline, enthusiastically devoted to their leader, and\r\nfull of confidence in his military genius and his victorious destiny.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Macedonian phalanx formed the main strength of his\r\ninfantry. This force had been raised and organized by his father Philip,\r\nwho on his accession to the Macedonian throne needed a numerous and\r\nquickly-formed army, and who, by lengthening the spear of the ordinary\r\nGreek phalanx, and increasing the depth of the files, brought the tactic\r\nof armed masses to the greatest efficiency of which it was capable with\r\nsuch materials as he possessed. [See Niebuhr's Hist. of Rome, iii. 488.]\r\nHe formed his men sixteen deep, and placed in their grasp the SARISSA,\r\nas the Macedonian pike was called, which was four-and-twenty feet in\r\nlength, and when couched for action, reached eighteen feet in front of\r\nthe soldier: so that, as a space of about two feet was allowed between\r\nthe ranks, the spears of the five files behind him projected in advance\r\nof each front-rank man. The phalangite soldier was fully equipped in\r\nthe defensive armour of the regular Greek infantry. And thus the phalanx\r\npresented a ponderous and bristling mass, which as long as its order was\r\nkept compact, was sure to bear down all opposition. The defects of such\r\nan organization are obvious, and were proved in after years, when the\r\nMacedonians were opposed to the Roman legions. But it is clear that,\r\nunder Alexander, the phalanx was not the cumbrous unwieldy body which\r\nit was at Cynoscephalae and Pydna. His men were veterans; and he could\r\nobtain from them an accuracy of movement and steadiness of evolution,\r\nsuch as probably the recruits of his father would only have floundered\r\nin attempting, and such as certainly were impracticable in the phalanx\r\nwhen handled by his successors: especially as under them it ceased to\r\nbe a standing force, and became only a militia. [See Niebuhr.] Under\r\nAlexander the phalanx consisted of an aggregate of eighteen thousand\r\nmen, who were divided into six brigades of three thousand each. These\r\nwere again subdivided into regiments and companies; and the men were\r\ncarefully trained to wheel, to face about, to take more ground, or to\r\nclose up, as the emergencies of the battle required. Alexander also\r\narrayed in the intervals of the regiments of his phalangites, troops\r\narmed in a different manner, which could prevent their line from being\r\npierced, and their companies taken in flank, when the nature of the\r\nground prevented a close formation; and which could be withdrawn, when a\r\nfavourable opportunity arrived for closing up the phalanx or any of its\r\nbrigades for a charge, or when it was necessary to prepare to receive\r\ncavalry.\r\n\r\nBesides the phalanx, Alexander had a considerable force of infantry\r\nwho were called shield-bearers: they were not so heavily armed as the\r\nphalangites, or as was the case with the Greek regular infantry\r\nin general; but they were equipped for close fight, as well as for\r\nskirmishing, and were far superior to the ordinary irregular troops of\r\nGreek warfare. They were about six thousand strong. Besides these,\r\nhe had several bodies of Greek regular infantry; and he had archers,\r\nslingers, and javelin-men, who fought also with broadsword and target.\r\nThese were principally supplied to him by the highlanders of Illyria and\r\nThracia. The main strength of his cavalry consisted in two chosen corps\r\nof cuirassiers, one Macedonian, and one Thessalian each of which was\r\nabout fifteen hundred strong. They were provided with long lances and\r\nheavy swords, and horse as well as man was fully equipped with defensive\r\narmour. Other regiments of regular cavalry were less heavily armed, and\r\nthere were several bodies of light horsemen, whom Alexander's conquests\r\nin Egypt and Syria had enabled him to mount superbly.\r\n\r\nA little before the end of August, Alexander crossed the Euphrates\r\nat Thapsacus, a small corps of Persian cavalry under Mazaeus retiring\r\nbefore him. Alexander was too prudent to march down through the\r\nMesopotamian deserts, and continued to advance eastward with the\r\nintention of passing the Tigris, and then, if he was unable to find\r\nDarius and bring him to action, of marching southward on the left side\r\nof that river along the skirts of a mountainous district where his men\r\nwould suffer less from heat and thirst, and where provisions would be\r\nmore abundant.\r\n\r\nDarius, finding that his adversary was not to be enticed into the march\r\nthrough Mesopotamia against his capital, determined to remain on the\r\nbattle-ground which he had chosen on the left of the Tigris; where, if\r\nhis enemy met a defeat or a check, the destruction of the invaders would\r\nbe certain with two such rivers as the Euphrates and the Tigris in their\r\nrear. The Persian king availed himself to the utmost of every advantage\r\nin his power. He caused a large space of ground to be carefully levelled\r\nfor the operation of his scythe-armed chariots; and he deposited his\r\nmilitary stores in the strong town of Arbela, about twenty miles in\r\nhis rear. The rhetoricians of after ages have loved to describe Darius\r\nCodomannus as a second Xerxes in ostentation and imbecility; but a fair\r\nexamination of his generalship in this his last campaign, shows that he\r\nwas worthy of bearing the same name as his great predecessor, the royal\r\nson of Hystaspes.\r\n\r\nOn learning that Darius was with a large army on the left of the Tigris,\r\nAlexander hurried forward and crossed that river without opposition. He\r\nwas at first unable to procure any certain intelligence of the precise\r\nposition of the enemy, and after giving his army a short interval\r\nof rest, he marched for four days down the left bank of the river. A\r\nmoralist may pause upon the fact, that Alexander must in this march have\r\npassed within a few miles of the remains of Nineveh, the great, city of\r\nthe primaeval conquerors of the human race. Neither the Macedonian king\r\nnor any of his followers knew what those vast mounds had once been. They\r\nhad already become nameless masses of grass-grown ruins; and it is only\r\nwithin the last few years that the intellectual energy of one of our own\r\ncountrymen has rescued Nineveh from its long centuries of oblivion. [See\r\nLayard's \"Nineveh,\" and also Vaux's \"Nineveh and Persepolis,\" p. 16.]\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day of Alexander's southward march, his advanced guard\r\nreported that a body of the enemy's cavalry was in sight. He instantly\r\nformed his army in order for battle, and directing them to advance\r\nsteadily, he rode forward at the head of some squadrons of cavalry,\r\nand charged the Persian horse whom he found before him. This was a\r\nmere reconnoitring party, and they broke and fled immediately; but the\r\nMacedonians made some prisoners, and from them Alexander found that\r\nDarius was posted only a few miles off and learned the strength of the\r\narmy that he had with him. On receiving this news, Alexander halted, and\r\ngave his men repose for four days, so that they should go into action\r\nfresh and vigorous. He also fortified his camp, and deposited in it all\r\nhis military stores, and all his sick and disabled soldiers; intending\r\nto advance upon the enemy with the serviceable part of his army\r\nperfectly unencumbered. After this halt, he moved forward, while it was\r\nyet dark, with the intention of reaching the enemy, and attacking\r\nthem at break of day. About half-way between the camps there were some\r\nundulations of the ground, which concealed the two armies from each\r\nother's view. But, on Alexander arriving at their summit, he saw by the\r\nearly light the Persian host arrayed before him; and he probably also\r\nobserved traces of some engineering operation having been carried on\r\nalong part of the ground in front of them. Not knowing that these marks\r\nhad been caused by the Persians having levelled the ground for the free\r\nuse of their war-chariots, Alexander suspected that hidden pitfalls had\r\nbeen prepared with a view of disordering the approach of his cavalry.\r\nHe summoned a council of war forthwith, some of the officers were for\r\nattacking instantly at all hazards, but the more prudent opinion of\r\nParmenio prevailed, and it was determined not to advance farther till\r\nthe battle-ground had been carefully surveyed.\r\n\r\nAlexander halted his army on the heights; and taking with him some\r\nlight-armed infantry and some cavalry, he passed part of the day in\r\nreconnoitring the enemy, and observing the nature of the ground which he\r\nhad to fight on. Darius wisely refrained from moving from his position\r\nto attack the Macedonians on eminences which they occupied, and the two\r\narmies remained until night without molesting each other. On Alexander's\r\nreturn to his head-quarters, he summoned his generals and superior\r\nofficers together, and telling them that he well knew that THEIR\r\nzeal wanted no exhortation, he besought them to do their utmost in\r\nencouraging and instructing those whom each commanded, to do their best\r\nin the next day's battle. They were to remind them that they were now\r\nnot going to fight for a province, as they had hitherto fought, but\r\nthey were about to decide by their swords the dominion of all Asia. Each\r\nofficer ought to impress this upon his subalterns and they should urge\r\nit on their men. Their natural courage required no long words to excite\r\nits ardour: but they should be reminded of the paramount importance of\r\nsteadiness in action. The silence in the ranks must be unbroken as long\r\nas silence was proper; but when the time came for the charge, the shout\r\nand the cheer must be full of terror for the foe. The officers were to\r\nbe alert in receiving and communicating orders; and every one was to act\r\nas if he felt that the whole result of the battle depended on his own\r\nsingle good conduct.\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly instructed his generals, Alexander ordered that the\r\narmy should sup, and take their rest for the night.\r\n\r\nDarkness had closed over the tents of the Macedonians, when Alexander's\r\nveteran general, Parmenio, came to him, and proposed that they should\r\nmake a night attack on the Persians. The King is said to have answered,\r\nthat he scorned to such a victory, and that Alexander must conquer\r\nopenly and fairly. Arrian justly remarks that Alexander's resolution was\r\nas wise as it was spirited. Besides the confusion and uncertainty which\r\nare inseparable from night engagements, the value of Alexander's victory\r\nwould have been impaired, if gained under circumstances which might\r\nsupply the enemy with any excuse for his defeat, and encourage him\r\nto renew the contest. It was necessary for Alexander not only to beat\r\nDarius, but to gain such a victory as should leave his rival without\r\napology for defeat, and without hope of recovery.\r\n\r\nThe Persians, in fact, expected, and were prepared to meet a night\r\nattack. Such was the apprehension that Darius entertained of it, that\r\nhe formed his troops at evening in order of battle, and kept them under\r\narms all night. The effect of this was, that the morning found them\r\njaded and dispirited, while it brought their adversaries all fresh and\r\nvigorous against them.\r\n\r\nThe written order of battle which Darius himself caused to be drawn\r\nup, fell into the hands of the Macedonians after the engagement, and\r\nAristobulus copied it into his journal. We thus possess, through Arrian,\r\nunusually authentic information as to the composition and arrangement\r\nof the Persian army. On the extreme left were the Bactrian, Daan, and\r\nArachosian cavalry. Next to these Darius placed the troops from Persia\r\nproper, both horse and foot. Then came the Susians, and next to these\r\nthe Cadusians. These forces made up the left wing. Darius's own station\r\nwas in the centre. This was composed of the Indians, the Carians, the\r\nMardian archers, and the division of Persians who were distinguished\r\nby the golden apples that formed knobs of their spears. Here also were\r\nstationed the body-guard of the Persian nobility. Besides these, there\r\nwere in the centre, formed in deep order, the Uxian and Babylonian\r\ntroops, and the soldiers from the Red Sea. The brigade of Greek\r\nmercenaries, whom Darius had in his service, and who were alone\r\nconsidered fit to stand in the charge of the Macedonian phalanx,\r\nwas drawn up on either side of the royal chariot. The right wing\r\nwas composed of the Coelosyrians and Mesopotamians, the Medes, the\r\nParthians, the Sacians, the Tapurians, Hyrcanians, Albanians, and\r\nSacesinae. In advance of the line on the left wing were placed the\r\nScythian cavalry, with a thousand of the Bactrian horse, and a hundred\r\nscythe-armed chariots. The elephants and fifty scythe-armed chariots\r\nwere ranged in front of the centre; and fifty more chariots, with the\r\nArmenian and Cappadocian cavalry, were drawn up in advance of the right\r\nwing.\r\n\r\nThus arrayed, the great host of King Darius passed the night, that to\r\nmany thousands of them was the last of their existence. The morning of\r\nthe first of October, two thousand one hundred and eighty-two years ago,\r\ndawned slowly to their wearied watching, and they could hear the note of\r\nthe Macedonian trumpet sounding to arms, and could see King Alexander's\r\nforces descend from their tents on the heights, and form in order of\r\nbattle on the plain. [See Clinton's \"Fasti Hellenici.\" The battle was\r\nfought eleven days after an eclipse of the moon, which gives the means\r\nof fixing the precise date.]\r\n\r\nThere was deep need of skill, as well as of valour, on Alexander's side;\r\nand few battle-fields have witnessed more consummate generalship than\r\nwas now displayed by the Macedonian king. There were no natural barriers\r\nby which he could protect his flanks; and not only was he certain to\r\nbe overlapped on either wing by the vast lines of the Persian army, but\r\nthere was imminent risk of their circling round him and charging him in\r\nthe rear, while he advanced against their centre. He formed, therefore,\r\na second or reserve line, which was to wheel round, if required, or\r\nto detach troops to either flank; as the enemy's movements might\r\nnecessitate: and thus, with their whole army ready at any moment to\r\nbe thrown into one vast hollow square, the Macedonians advanced in two\r\nlines against the enemy, Alexander himself leading on the right wing,\r\nand the renowned phalanx forming the centre, while Parmenio commanded on\r\nthe left.\r\n\r\nSuch was the general nature of the disposition which Alexander made\r\nof his army. But we have in Arrian the details of the position of each\r\nbrigade and regiment; and as we know that these details were taken from\r\nthe journals of Macedonian generals, it is interesting to examine them,\r\nand to read the names and stations of King Alexander's generals and\r\ncolonels in this the greatest of his battles.\r\n\r\nThe eight troops of the royal horse-guards formed the right of\r\nAlexander's line. Their captains were Cleitus (whose regiment was on the\r\nextreme right, the post of peculiar danger), Graucias, Ariston, Sopolis,\r\nHeracleides, Demetrias, Meleager, and Hegelochus. Philotas was general\r\nof the whole division. Then came the shield-bearing infantry: Nicanor\r\nwas their general. Then came the phalanx, in six brigades. Coenus's\r\nbrigade was on the right, and nearest to the shield-bearers; next\r\nto this stood the brigade of Perdiccas, then Meleager's, then\r\nPolysperchon's; and then the brigade of Amynias, but which was now\r\ncommanded by Simmias, as Amynias had been sent to Macedonia to levy\r\nrecruits. Then came the infantry of the left wing, under the command of\r\nCraterus. Next to Craterus's infantry were placed the cavalry regiments\r\nof the allies, with Eriguius for their general. The Messalian cavalry,\r\ncommanded by Philippus, were next, and held the extreme left of\r\nthe whole army. The whole left wing was entrusted to the command of\r\nParmenio, who had round his person the Pharsalian troop of\r\ncavalry, which was the strongest and best amid all the Thessalian\r\nhorse-regiments.\r\n\r\nThe centre of the second line was occupied by a body of phalangite\r\ninfantry, formed of companies, which were drafted for this purpose from\r\neach of the brigades of their phalanx. The officers in command of\r\nthis corps were ordered to be ready to face about, if the enemy should\r\nsucceed in gaining the rear of the army. On the right of this reserve\r\nof infantry, in the second line, and behind the royal horse-guards,\r\nAlexander placed half the Agrian light-armed infantry under Attalus, and\r\nwith them Brison's body of Macedonian archers, and Cleander's regiment\r\nof foot. He also placed in this part of his army Menidas's squadron of\r\ncavalry, and Aretes's and Ariston's light horse. Menidas was ordered to\r\nwatch if the enemy's cavalry tried to turn the flank, and if they did\r\nso, to charge them before they wheeled completely round, and so take\r\nthem in flank themselves. A similar force was arranged on the left of\r\nthe second line for the same purpose, The Thracian infantry of Sitalces\r\nwas placed there, and Coeranus's regiment of the cavalry of the Greek\r\nallies, and Agathon's troops of the Odrysian irregular horse.\r\nThe extreme left of the second line in this quarter was held by\r\nAndromachus's cavalry. A division of Thracian infantry was left in guard\r\nof the camp. In advance of the right wing and centre was scattered\r\na number of light-armed troops, of javelin-men and bowmen, with the\r\nintention of warding off the charge of the armed chariots. [Kleber's\r\narrangement of his troops at the battle of Heliopolis, where, with ten\r\nthousand Europeans, he had to encounter eighty thousand Asiatics in an\r\nopen plain, is worth comparing with Alexander's tactics at Arbela. See\r\nThiers's \"Histoire du Consulat,\" &c. vol. ii. livre v.]\r\n\r\nConspicuous by the brilliancy of his armour, and by the chosen band of\r\nofficers who were round his person, Alexander took his own station, as\r\nhis custom was, in the right wing, at the head of his cavalry: and when\r\nall the arrangements for the battle were complete, and his generals were\r\nfully instructed how to act in each probable emergency, he began to lead\r\nhis men towards the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt was ever his custom to expose his life freely in battle, and to\r\nemulate the personal prowess of his great ancestor, Achilles. Perhaps in\r\nthe bold enterprise of conquering Persia, it was politic for Alexander\r\nto raise his army's daring to the utmost by the example of his own\r\nheroic valour: and, in his subsequent campaigns, the love of the\r\nexcitement, of \"the rapture of the strife,\" may have made him, like\r\nMurat, continue from choice a custom which he commenced from duty.\r\nBut he never suffered the ardour of the soldier to make him lose the\r\ncoolness of the general; and at Arbela, in particular, he showed that he\r\ncould act up to his favourite Homeric maxim.\r\n\r\nGreat reliance had been placed by the Persian king on the effects of\r\nthe scythe-bearing chariots. It was designed to launch these against the\r\nMacedonian phalanx, and to follow them up by a heavy charge of cavalry,\r\nwhich it was hoped would find the ranks of the spearmen disordered by\r\nthe rush of the chariots, and easily destroy this most formidable part\r\nof Alexander's force. In front, therefore, of the Persian centre, where\r\nDarius took his station, and which it was supposed the phalanx would\r\nattack, the ground had been carefully levelled and smoothed, so as to\r\nallow the chariots to charge over it with their full sweep and speed.\r\nAs the Macedonian army approached the Persian, Alexander found that the\r\nfront of his whole line barely equalled the front of the Persian centre,\r\nso that he was outflanked on his right by the entire left; wing of the\r\nenemy, and by their entire right wing on his left. His tactics were\r\nto assail some one point of the hostile army, and gain a decisive\r\nadvantage; while he refused, as far as possible, the encounter along the\r\nrest of the line. He therefore inclined his order of march to the right\r\nso as to enable his right wing and centre to come into collision with\r\nthe enemy on as favourable terms as possible though the manoeuvre might\r\nin some respects compromise his left.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this oblique movement was to bring the phalanx and his\r\nown wing nearly beyond the limits of the ground which the Persians had\r\nprepared for the operations of the chariots; and Darius, fearing to\r\nlose the benefit of this arm against the most important parts of the\r\nMacedonian force, ordered the Scythian and Bactrian cavalry, who were\r\ndrawn up on his extreme left, to charge round upon Alexander's right\r\nwing, and check its further lateral progress. Against these assailants\r\nAlexander sent from his second line Menidas's cavalry. As these proved\r\ntoo few to make head against the enemy, he ordered Ariston also from the\r\nsecond line with his light horse, and Cleander with his foot, in support\r\nof Menidas. The Bactrians and Scythians now began to give way, but\r\nDarius reinforced them by the mass of Bactrian cavalry from his main\r\nline, and an obstinate cavalry fight now took place. The Bactrians and\r\nScythians were numerous, and were better armed than the horseman\r\nunder Menidas and Ariston; and the loss at first was heaviest on the\r\nMacedonian side. But still the European cavalry stood the charge of the\r\nAsiatics, and at last, by their superior discipline, and by acting in\r\nsquadrons that supported each other, instead of fighting in a confused\r\nmass like the barbarians, the Macedonians broke their adversaries, and\r\ndrove them off the field. [The best explanation of this may be found\r\nin Napoleon's account of the cavalry fights between the French and\r\nthe Mamelukes:--\"Two Mamelukes were able to make head against three\r\nFrenchmen, because they were better armed, better mounted, and better\r\ntrained; they had two pair of pistols, a blunderbuss, a carbine, a\r\nhelmet with a vizor, and a coat of mail; they had several horses, and\r\nseveral attendants on foot. One hundred cuirassiers, however were not\r\nafraid of one hundred Mamelukes; three hundred could beat; an equal\r\nnumber, and one thousand could easily put to the rout fifteen hundred,\r\nso great is the influence of tactics, order, and evolutions! Leclerc and\r\nLasalle presented their men to the Mamelukes in several lines. When the\r\nArabs were on the point of overwhelming the first, the second came to\r\nits assistance on the right and left; the Mamelukes then halted and\r\nwheeled, in order to turn the wings of this new line; this moment\r\nwas always seized upon to charge them, and they were uniformly\r\nbroken.\"--MONTHOLON'S HISTORY OF THE CAPTIVITY OF NAPOLEON, iv. 70.]\r\n\r\nDarius, now directed the scythe-armed chariots to be driven against\r\nAlexander's horse-guards and the phalanx; and these formidable vehicles\r\nwere accordingly sent rattling across the plain, against the Macedonian\r\nline. When we remember the alarm which the war-chariots of the Britons\r\ncreated among Caesar's legions, we shall not be prone to deride this arm\r\nof ancient warfare as always useless. The object of the chariots was\r\nto create unsteadiness in the ranks against which they were driven,\r\nand squadrons of cavalry followed close upon them, to profit by such\r\ndisorder. But the Asiatic chariots were rendered ineffective at Arbela\r\nby the light-armed troops whom Alexander had specially appointed for\r\nthe service, and who, wounding the horses and drivers with their missile\r\nweapons, and running alongside so as to cut the traces or seize the\r\nreins, marred the intended charge; and the few chariots that reached\r\nthe phalanx passed harmlessly through the intervals which the spearmen\r\nopened for them, and were easily captured in the rear.\r\n\r\nA mass of the Asiatic cavalry was now, for the second time, collected\r\nagainst Alexander's extreme right, and moved round it, with the view of\r\ngaining the flank of his army. At the critical moment, Aretes, with his\r\nhorsemen from Alexander's second line, dashed on the Persian squadrons\r\nwhen their own flanks were exposed by this evolution. While Alexander\r\nthus met and baffled all the flanking attacks of the enemy with troops\r\nbrought up from his second line, he kept his own horse-guards and the\r\nrest of the front line of his wing fresh, and ready to take advantage\r\nof the first opportunity for striking a decisive blow. This soon came. A\r\nlarge body of horse, who were posted on the Persian left wing nearest to\r\nthe centre, quitted their station, and rode off to help their comrades\r\nin the cavalry fight that still was going on at the extreme right of\r\nAlexander's wing against the detachments from his second line. This made\r\na huge gap in the Persian array, and into this space Alexander instantly\r\ndashed with his guard; and then pressing towards his left, he soon\r\nbegan to make havoc in the left flank of the Persian centre. The\r\nshield-bearing infantry now charged also among the reeling masses of the\r\nAsiatics; and five of the brigades of the phalanx, with the irresistible\r\nmight of their sarissas, bore down the Greek mercenaries of Darius,\r\nand dug their way through the Persian centre. In the early part of the\r\nbattle, Darius had showed skill and energy; and he now for some time\r\nencouraged his men, by voice and example, to keep firm. But the lances\r\nof Alexander's cavalry, and the pikes of the phalanx now gleamed nearer\r\nand nearer to him. His charioteer was struck down by a javelin at his\r\nside; and at last Darius's nerve failed him; and, descending from\r\nhis chariot, he mounted on a fleet horse and galloped from the plain,\r\nregardless of the state of the battle in other parts of the field, where\r\nmatters were going on much more favourably for his cause, and where his\r\npresence might have done much towards gaining a victory.\r\n\r\nAlexander's operations with his right and centre had exposed his left\r\nto an immensely preponderating force of the enemy. Parmenio kept out of\r\naction as long as possible; but Mazaeus, who commanded the Persian right\r\nwing, advanced against him, completely outflanked him, and pressed\r\nhim severely with reiterated charges by superior numbers. Seeing the\r\ndistress of Parmenio's wing, Simmias, who commanded the sixth brigade of\r\nthe phalanx, which was next to the left wing, did not advance with the\r\nother brigades in the great charge upon the Persian centre, but kept\r\nback to cover Parmenio's troops on their right flank; as otherwise they\r\nwould have been completely surrounded and cut off from the rest of the\r\nMacedonian army. By so doing, Simmias had unavoidably opened a gap in\r\nthe Macedonian left centre; and a large column of Indian and Persian\r\nhorse, from the Persian right centre, had galloped forward through this\r\ninterval, and right through the troops of the Macedonian second line.\r\nInstead of then wheeling round upon Sarmenio, or upon the rear of\r\nAlexander's conquering wing, the Indian and Persian cavalry rode\r\nstraight on to the Macedonian camp, overpowered the Thracians who were\r\nleft in charge of it, and began to plunder. This was stopped by the\r\nphalangite troops of the second line, who, after the enemy's horsemen\r\nhad rushed by them, faced about, countermarched upon the camp, killed\r\nmany of the Indians and Persians in the act of plundering, and forced\r\nthe rest to ride off again. Just at this crisis, Alexander had been\r\nrecalled from his pursuit of Darius, by tidings of the distress of\r\nParmenio, and of his inability to bear up any longer against the hot\r\nattacks of Mazaeus. Taking his horse-guards with him, Alexander rode\r\ntowards the part of the field where his left wing was fighting; but on\r\nhis way thither he encountered the Persian and Indian cavalry, on their\r\nreturn from his camp.\r\n\r\nThese men now saw that their only chance of safety was to cut their\r\nway through; and in one huge column they charged desperately upon the\r\nMacedonians. There was here a close hand-to-hand fight, which lasted\r\nsome time, and sixty of the royal horse-guards fell, and three generals,\r\nwho fought close to Alexander's side, were wounded. At length the\r\nMacedonian, discipline and valour again prevailed, and a large number of\r\nthe Persian and Indian horsemen were cut down; some few only succeeded\r\nin breaking through and riding away. Relieved of these obstinate\r\nenemies, Alexander again formed his horse-guards, and led them towards\r\nParmenio; but by this time that general also was victorious. Probably\r\nthe news of Darius's flight had reached Mazaeus, and had damped the\r\nardour of the Persian right wing; while the tidings of their comrades'\r\nsuccess must have proportionally encouraged the Macedonian forces under\r\nParmenio. His Thessalian cavalry particularly distinguished themselves\r\nby their gallantry and persevering good conduct; and by the time that\r\nAlexander had ridden up to Parmenio, the whole Persian army was in full\r\nflight from the field.\r\n\r\nIt was of the deepest importance to Alexander to secure the person of\r\nDarius, and he now urged on the pursuit. The river Lycus was between the\r\nfield of battle and the city of Arbela, whither the fugitives directed\r\ntheir course, and the passage of this river was even more destructive to\r\nthe Persians than the swords and spears of the Macedonians had been\r\nin the engagement. [I purposely omit any statement of the loss in the\r\nbattle. There is a palpable error of the transcribers in the numbers\r\nwhich we find in our present manuscripts of Arrian; and Curtius is of no\r\nauthority.] The narrow bridge was soon choked up by the flying\r\nthousands who rushed towards it, and vast numbers of the Persians\r\nthrew themselves, or were hurried by others, into the rapid stream, and\r\nperished in its waters. Darius had crossed it, and had ridden on through\r\nArbela without halting. Alexander reached that city on the next day, and\r\nmade himself master of all Darius's treasure and stores; but the Persian\r\nking unfortunately for himself, had fled too fast for his conqueror:\r\nhe had only escaped to perish by the treachery of his Bactrian satrap,\r\nBessus.\r\n\r\nA few days after the battle Alexander entered Babylon, \"the oldest\r\nseat of earthly empire\" then in existence, as its acknowledged lord and\r\nmaster. There were yet some campaigns of his brief and bright career\r\nto be accomplished. Central Asia was yet to witness the march of his\r\nphalanx. He was yet to effect that conquest of Affghanistan in which\r\nEngland since has failed. His generalship, as well as his valour, were\r\nyet to be signalised on the banks of the Hydaspes, and the field of\r\nChillianwallah; and he was yet to precede the Queen of England in\r\nannexing the Punjaub to the dominions of an European sovereign. But the\r\ncrisis of his career was reached; the great object of his mission was\r\naccomplished; and the ancient Persian empire, which once menaced all\r\nthe nations of the earth with subjection, was irreparably crushed, when\r\nAlexander had won his crowning victory at Arbela.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF EVENTS BETWEEN THE BATTLE OF ARBELA AND THE BATTLE OF THE\r\nMETAURUS.\r\n\r\nB.C. 330.

Alexander's campaigns in Upper Asia. \"Having conquered\r\nDarius, Alexander pursued his way, encountering difficulties which would\r\nhave appalled almost any other general, through Bactriana, and taking\r\nBactra, or Zariaspa, (now Balkh), the chief city of that province, where\r\nhe spent the winter. Crossing the Oxus, he advanced in the following\r\nspring to Marakanda (Samarcand) to replace the loss of horses which he\r\nhad sustained in crossing the Caucasus, to obtain supplies from the rich\r\nvalley of Sogd (the Mahometan Paradise of Mader-al-Nahr), and to enforce\r\nthe submission of Transoxiana. The northern limit of his march is\r\nprobably represented by the modern Uskand, or Aderkand, a village on the\r\nIaxartes, near the end of the Ferganah district. In Margiana he founded\r\nanother Alexandria. Returning from the north, he led on his army in the\r\nhope of conquering India, till at length, marching in a line apparently\r\nnearly parallel with the Kabul river, he arrived at the celebrated rock\r\nAornos, the position of which must have been on the right bank of the\r\nIndus, at some distance from Attock; and it may perhaps be represented\r\nby the modern Akora\"--(VAUX.)\r\n\r\n327, 326.

Alexander returns to Babylon. \"In the tenth year after he had\r\ncrossed the Hellespont, Alexander, having won his vast dominion, entered\r\nBabylon; and resting from his career in that oldest seat of earthly\r\nempire, he steadily surveyed the mass of various nations which owned his\r\nsovereignty, and revolved in his mind the great work of breathing into\r\nthis huge but inert body the living spirit of Greek civilization. In the\r\nbloom of youthful manhood, at the age of thirty-two, he paused from\r\nthe fiery speed of his earlier course; and for the first time gave the\r\nnations an opportunity of offering their homage before his throne. They\r\ncame from all the extremities of the earth to propitiate his anger, to\r\ncelebrate his greatness, or to solicit his protection.... History may\r\nallow us to think that Alexander and a Roman ambassador did meet at\r\nBabylon; that the greatest man of the ancient world saw and spoke with\r\na citizen of that great nation, which was destined to succeed him in\r\nhis appointed work, and to found a wider and still more enduring empire.\r\nThey met, too, in Babylon, almost beneath the shadow of the temple of\r\nBel, perhaps the earliest monument ever raised by human pride and power,\r\nin a city stricken, as it were, by the word of God's heaviest\r\njudgment, as the symbol of greatness apart from and opposed to\r\ngoodness.\"--(ARNOLD.)\r\n\r\n323. Alexander dies at Babylon. On his death being known at Greece, the\r\nAthenians, and others of the southern states, take up arms to shake off\r\nthe domination of Macedon. They are at first successful; but the return\r\nof some of Alexander's veterans from Asia enables Antipater to prevail\r\nover them.\r\n\r\n317 to 289. Agathocles is tyrant of Syracuse; and carries on repeated\r\nwars with the Carthaginians; in the course of which (311) he invades\r\nAfrica, and reduces the Carthaginians to great distress.\r\n\r\n306. After a long series of wars with each other, and after all the\r\nheirs of Alexander had been murdered, his principal surviving generals\r\nassume the title of king, each over the provinces which he has occupied.\r\nThe four chief among them were Antigonus, Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and\r\nSeleucus. Antipater was now dead, but his son Cassander succeeded to his\r\npower in Macedonia and Greece.\r\n\r\n301. Seleucus and Lysimachus defeat Antigonus at Ipsus. Antigonus is\r\nkilled in the battle.\r\n\r\n280. Seleucus, the last of Alexander's captains, is assassinated. Of all\r\nAlexander's successors, Seleucus had formed the most powerful empire.\r\nHe had acquired all the provinces between Phrygia and the Indus. He\r\nextended his dominion in India beyond the limits reached by Alexander.\r\nSeleucus had some sparks of his great master's genius in promoting\r\ncivilization and commerce, as well as in gaining victories. Under his\r\nsuccessors, the Seleucidae, this vast empire rapidly diminished; Bactria\r\nbecame independent, and a separate dynasty of Greek kings ruled there\r\nin the year 125, when it was overthrown by the Scythian tribes. Parthia\r\nthrew off its allegiance to the Seleucidae in 250 B.C., and the powerful\r\nParthian kingdom, which afterwards proved so formidable a foe to Rome,\r\nabsorbed nearly all the provinces west of the Euphrates, that had obeyed\r\nthe first Seleucus. Before the battle of Ipsus, Mithridates, a Persian\r\nprince of the blood-royal of the Achaemenidae, had escaped to Pontus,\r\nand founded there the kingdom of that name.\r\n\r\nBesides the kingdom of Seleucus, which, when limited to Syria,\r\nPalestine, and parts of Asia Minor, long survived; the most important\r\nkingdom formed by a general of Alexander was that of the Ptolemies in\r\nEgypt. The throne of Macedonia was long and obstinately contended for by\r\nCassander, Polysperchon, Lysimachus, Pyrrhus, Antigonus, and others;\r\nbut at last was secured by the dynasty of Antigonus Gonatas. The old\r\nrepublics of southern Greece suffered severely during these tumults,\r\nand the only Greek states that showed any strength and spirit were\r\nthe cities of the Achaean league, the AEtolians, and the islanders of\r\nRhodes.\r\n\r\n290. Rome had now thoroughly subdued the Samnites and the Etruscans,\r\nand had gained numerous victories over the Cisalpine Gauls. Wishing to\r\nconfirm her dominion in Lower Italy, she became entangled in a war with\r\nPyrrhus, fourth king of Epirus, who was called over by the Tarentines\r\nto aid them. Pyrrhus was at first victorious, but in the year 275\r\nwas defeated by the Roman legions in a pitched battle. He returned to\r\nGreece, remarking, \"Rome becomes mistress of all Italy from the Rubicon\r\nto the Straits of Messina.\"\r\n\r\n264. The first Punic war begins. Its primary cause was the desire of\r\nboth the Romans and the Carthaginians to possess themselves of Sicily.\r\nThe Romans form a fleet, and successfully compete with the marine of\r\nCarthage. [There is at this present moment [written in June, 1851]\r\nin the Great Exhibition at Hyde Park a model of a piratical galley of\r\nLabuan, part of the mast of which can be let down on an enemy, and\r\nform a bridge for boarders. It is worth while to compare this with the\r\naccount in Polybius of the boarding bridges which the Roman admiral\r\nDullius, affixed to the masts of his galleys and by means of which he\r\nwon his great victory over the Carthaginian fleet.] During the latter\r\nhalf of the war, the military genius of Hamilcar Barca sustains the\r\nCarthaginian cause in Sicily. At the end of twenty-four years, the\r\nCarthaginians sue for peace, though their aggregate loss in ships and\r\nmen had been less than that sustained by the Romans since the beginning\r\nof the war. Sicily becomes a Roman province.\r\n\r\n240 to 218. The Carthaginian mercenaries who had been brought back\r\nfrom Sicily to Africa, mutiny against Carthage, and nearly succeed in\r\ndestroying her. After a sanguinary and desperate struggle, Hamilcar\r\nBarca crushes them. During this season of weakness to Carthage, Rome\r\ntakes from her the island of Sardinia. Hamilcar Barca forms the project\r\nof obtaining compensation by conquests in Spain, and thus enabling\r\nCarthage to renew the struggle with Rome. He takes Hannibal (then a\r\nchild) to Spain with him. He and, after his death, his brother, win\r\ngreat part of southern Spain to the Carthaginian interest. Hannibal\r\nobtains the command of the Carthaginian armies in Spain, 221 B.C., being\r\nthen twenty-six years old. He attacks Saguntum, a city on the Ebro in\r\nalliance with Rome, which is the immediate pretext for the second Punic\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval Rome had to sustain a storm from the north. The\r\nCisalpine Gauls, in 226, formed an alliance with one of the fiercest\r\ntribes of their brethren north of the Alps, and began a furious war\r\nagainst the Romans, which lasted six years. The Romans gave them several\r\nsevere defeats, and took from them part of their territories near the\r\nPo. It was on this occasion that the Roman colonies of Cremona and\r\nPlacentia were founded, the latter of which did such essential service\r\nto Rome in the second Punic war, by the resistance which it made to the\r\narmy of Hasdrubal. A muster-roll was made in this war of the effective\r\nmilitary force of the Romans themselves, and of those Italian states\r\nthat were subject to them. The return showed a force of seven hundred\r\nthousand foot, and seventy thousand horse. Polybius mentions this\r\nmuster.\r\n\r\n228. Hannibal crosses the Alps and invades Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. -- THE BATTLE OF THE METAURUS, B.C. 207.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Quid debeas, O Roma, Neronibus,\r\n   Testis Metaurum flumen, et Hasdrubal\r\n   Devictus, et pulcher fugatis\r\n   Ille dies Latio tenebris,\r\n\r\n   Qui primus alma risit adorea;\r\n   Dirus per urbes Afer ut Italas,\r\n   Ceu flamma per taedas, vel Eurus\r\n   Per Siculas equitavit undas.--HORATIUS, iv. Od. 4.\r\n\r\n   \"... The consul Nero, who made the unequalled march which\r\n   deceived Hannibal, and defeated Hasdrubal, thereby accomplishing\r\n   an achievement almost unrivalled in military annals.  The first\r\n   intelligence of his return, to Hannibal, was the sight of\r\n   Hasdrubal's head thrown into his camp.  When Hannibal saw this,\r\n   he exclaimed with a sigh, that 'Rome would now be the mistress of\r\n   the world.' To this victory of Nero's it might be owing that his\r\n   imperial namesake reigned at all.  But the infamy of the one has\r\n   eclipsed the glory of the other.  When the name of Nero is heard,\r\n   who thinks of the consul!  But such are human things.\"--BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout midway between Rimini and Ancona a little river falls into the\r\nAdriatic, after traversing one of those districts of Italy, in which\r\na vain attempt has lately been made to revive, after long centuries of\r\nservitude and shame, the spirit of Italian nationality, and the energy\r\nof free institutions. That stream is still called the Metauro; and\r\nwakens by its name recollections of the resolute daring of ancient\r\nRome, and of the slaughter that stained its current two thousand and\r\nsixty-three years ago, when the combined consular armies of Livius\r\nand Nero encountered and crushed near its banks the varied hosts which\r\nHannibal's brother was leading from the Pyrenees, the Rhone, the Alps,\r\nand the Po, to aid the great Carthaginian in his stern struggle to\r\nannihilate the growing might of the Roman Republic, and make the Punic\r\npower supreme over all the nations of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Roman historian, who termed that struggle the most memorable of all\r\nwars that ever were carried on, [Livy, Lib. xxi. sec. 1.] wrote-in no\r\nspirit of exaggeration. For it is not in ancient but in modern history,\r\nthat parallels for its incidents and its heroes are to be found. The\r\nsimilitude between the contest which Rome maintained against Hannibal,\r\nand that which England was for many years engaged in against Napoleon,\r\nhas not passed unobserved by recent historians. \"Twice,\" says Arnold,\r\n[Vol. iii, p. 62. See also Alison--PASSIM.] \"has there been witnessed\r\nthe struggle of the highest individual genius against the resources and\r\ninstitutions of a great nation; and in both cases the nation has been\r\nvictorious. For seventeen years Hannibal strove against Rome; for\r\nsixteen years Napoleon Bonaparte strove against England; the efforts of\r\nthe first ended in Zama, those of the second in Waterloo.\" One point,\r\nhowever, of the similitude between the two wars has scarcely been\r\nadequately dwelt on. That is, the remarkable parallel between the Roman\r\ngeneral who finally defeated the great Carthaginian, and the English\r\ngeneral who gave the last deadly overthrow to the French emperor. Scipio\r\nand Wellington both held for many years commands of high importance,\r\nbut distant from the main theatres of warfare. The same country was the\r\nscene of the principal military career of each. It was in Spain that\r\nScipio, like Wellington, successively encountered and overthrew nearly\r\nall the subordinate generals of the enemy, before being opposed to\r\nthe chief champion and conqueror himself. Both Scipio and Wellington\r\nrestored their countrymen's confidence in arms, when shaken by a series\r\nof reverses. And each of them closed a long and perilous war by a\r\ncomplete and overwhelming defeat of the chosen leader and the chosen\r\nveterans of the foe.\r\n\r\nNor is the parallel between them limited to their military characters\r\nand exploits. Scipio, like Wellington, became an important leader of\r\nthe aristocratic party among his countrymen, and was exposed to\r\nthe unmeasured invectives of the violent section of his political\r\nantagonists. When, early in the last reign, an infuriated mob assaulted\r\nthe Duke of Wellington in the streets of the English capital on the\r\nanniversary of Waterloo, England was even more disgraced by that\r\noutrage, than Rome was by the factious accusations which demagogues\r\nbrought against Scipio, but which he proudly repelled on the day of\r\ntrial, by reminding the assembled people that it was the anniversary\r\nof the battle of Zama. Happily, a wiser and a better spirit has now for\r\nyears pervaded all classes of our community; and we shall be spared\r\nthe ignominy of having worked out to the end the parallel of national\r\niugratitude. Scipio died a voluntary exile from the malevolent\r\nturbulence of Rome. Englishmen of all ranks and politics have now long\r\nunited in affectionate admiration of our modern Scipio: and even\r\nthose who have most widely differed from the Duke on legislative or\r\nadministrative questions, forget what they deem the political errors of\r\nthat time-honoured head, while they gratefully call to mind the laurels\r\nthat have wreathed it.\r\n\r\nScipio at Zama trampled in the dust the power of Carthage; but that\r\npower had been already irreparably shattered in another field, where\r\nneither Scipio nor Hannibal commanded. When the Metaurus witnessed the\r\ndefeat and death of Hasdrubal, it witnessed the ruin of the scheme\r\nby which alone Carthage could hope to organise decisive success,--the\r\nscheme of enveloping Rome at once from the north and the south of Italy\r\nby chosen armies, led by two sons of Hamilcar. [See Arnold, vol. iii, p.\r\n387.] That battle was the determining crisis of the contest, not merely\r\nbetween Rome and Carthage, but between the two great families of the\r\nworld, which then made Italy the arena of their oft-renewed contest for\r\npre-eminence.\r\n\r\nThe French historian Michelet whose \"Histoire Romaine\" would have been\r\ninvaluable, if the general industry and accuracy of the writer had in\r\nany degree equalled his originality and brilliancy, eloquently remarks:\r\n\"It is not without reason that so universal and vivid a remembrance of\r\nthe Punic wars has dwelt in the memories of men. They formed no mere\r\nstruggle to determine the lot of two cities or two empires; but it was a\r\nstrife on the event of which depended the fate of two races of mankind,\r\nwhether the dominion of the world should belong to the Indo-Germanic or\r\nto the Semitic family of nations. Bear in mind, that the first of these\r\ncomprises, besides the Indians and the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans,\r\nand the Germans. In the other are ranked the Jews and the Arabs, the\r\nPhoenicians and the Carthaginians. On the one side is the genius\r\nof heroism, of art, and legislation: on the other is the spirit of\r\nindustry, of commerce, of navigation. The two opposite races have\r\neverywhere come into contact, everywhere into hostility. In the\r\nprimitive history of Persia and Chaldea, the heroes are perpetually\r\nengaged in combat with their industrious and perfidious, neighbours.\r\nThe struggle is renewed between the Phoenicians and the Greeks on every\r\ncoast of the Mediterranean. The Greek supplants the Phoenician in all\r\nhis factories, all his colonies in the east: soon will the Roman come,\r\nand do likewise in the west. Alexander did far more against Tyre than\r\nSalmanasar or Nabuchodonosor had done. Not content with crushing her, he\r\ntook care that she never should revive: for he founded Alexandria as\r\nher substitute, and changed for ever the track of commerce of the\r\nworld. There remained Carthage--the great Carthage, and her mighty\r\nempire,--mighty in a far different degree than Phoenicia's had been.\r\nRome annihilated it. Then occurred that which has no parallel in\r\nhistory,--an entire civilisation perished at one blow--vanished, like a\r\nfalling star. The 'Periplus' of Hanno, a few coins, a score of lines in\r\nPlautus, and, lo, all that remains of the Carthaginian world!\r\n\r\n\"Many generations must needs pass away before the struggle between the\r\ntwo races could be renewed; and the Arabs, that formidable rear-guard of\r\nthe Semitic world, dashed forth from their deserts. The conflict between\r\nthe two races then became the conflict of two religions. Fortunate was\r\nit that those daring Saracenic cavaliers encountered in the East the\r\nimpregnable walls of Constantinople, in the West the chivalrous valour\r\nof Charles Martel and the sword of the Cid. The crusades were the\r\nnatural reprisals for the Arab invasions, and form the last epoch of\r\nthat great struggle between the two principal families of the human\r\nrace.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult amid the glimmering light supplied by the allusions\r\nof the classical writers to gain a full idea of the character and\r\ninstitutions of Rome's great rival. But we can perceive how inferior\r\nCarthage was to her competitor in military resources; and how far\r\nless fitted than Rome she was to become the founder of centralized and\r\ncentralizing dominion, that should endure for centuries, and fuse into\r\nimperial unity the narrow nationalities of the ancient races that dwelt\r\naround and near the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nCarthage was originally neither the most ancient nor the most powerful\r\nof the numerous colonies which the Phoenicians planted on the coast of\r\nNorthern Africa. But her advantageous position, the excellence of her\r\nconstitution (of which, though ill-informed as to its details, we know\r\nthat it commanded the admiration of Aristotle), and the commercial and\r\npolitical energy of her citizens, gave her the ascendancy over Hippo,\r\nUtica, Leptis, and her other sister Phoenician cities in those regions;\r\nand she finally seduced them to a condition of dependency, similar to\r\nthat which the subject allies of Athens occupied relatively to that once\r\nimperial city. When Tyre and Sidon and the other cities of Phoenicia\r\nitself sank from independent republics into mere vassal states of the\r\ngreat Asiatic monarchies and obeyed by turns a Babylonian, a Persian,\r\nand a Macedonian master, their power and their traffic rapidly declined;\r\nand Carthage succeeded to the important maritime and commercial\r\ncharacter which they had previously maintained. The Carthaginians did\r\nnot seek to compete with the Greeks on the north-eastern shores of the\r\nMediterranean, or in the three inland seas which are connected with\r\nit; but they maintained an active intercourse with the Phoenicians,\r\nand through them with lower and Central Asia; and they, and they\r\nalone, after the decline and fall of Tyre, navigated the waters of the\r\nAtlantic. They had the monopoly of all the commerce of the world that\r\nwas carried on beyond the Straits of Gibraltar. We have yet extant (in\r\na Greek translation) the narrative of the voyage of Hanno, one of their\r\nadmirals, along the western coast of Africa as far as Sierra Leone. And\r\nin the Latin poem of Festus Avienus, frequent references are made to\r\nthe records of the voyages of another celebrated Carthaginian admiral,\r\nHimilco, who had explored the north-western coast of Europe. Our own\r\nislands are mentioned by Himilco as the lands of the Hiberni and the\r\nAlbioni. It is indeed certain that the Carthaginians frequented the\r\nCornish coast (as the Phoenicians had done before them) for the purpose\r\nof procuring tin; and there is every reason to believe that they sailed\r\nas far as the coasts of the Baltic for amber. When it is remembered that\r\nthe mariner's compass was unknown in those ages, the boldness and skill\r\nof the seamen of Carthage, and the enterprise of her merchants, may be\r\nparalleled with any achievements that the history of modern navigation\r\nand commerce can supply.\r\n\r\nIn their Atlantic voyages along the African shores, the Carthaginians\r\nfollowed the double object of trade and colonization. The numerous\r\nsettlements that were planted by them along the coast from Morocco to\r\nSenegal, provided for the needy members of the constantly-increasing\r\npopulation of a great commercial capital; and also strengthened the\r\ninfluence which Carthage exercised among the tribes of the African\r\ncoast. Besides her fleets, her caravans gave her a large and lucrative\r\ntrade with the native Africans; nor must we limit our belief of the\r\nextent of the Carthaginian trade with the tribes of Central and Western\r\nAfrica, by the narrowness of the commercial intercourse which civilized\r\nnations of modern times have been able to create in those regions.\r\n\r\nAlthough essentially a mercantile and seafaring people, the\r\nCarthaginians by no means neglected agriculture. On the contrary, the\r\nwhole of their territory was cultivated like a garden. The fertility of\r\nthe soil repaid the skill and toil bestowed on it; and every invader,\r\nfrom Agathocles to Scipio AEmilianus, was struck with admiration at\r\nthe rich pasture-lands carefully irrigated, the abundant harvests,\r\nthe luxuriant vineyards, the plantations of fig and olive-trees, the\r\nthriving villages, the populous towns, and the splendid villas of the\r\nwealthy Carthaginians, through which his march lay, as long as he was on\r\nCarthaginian ground.\r\n\r\nThe Carthaginians abandoned the Aegean and the Pontus to the Greeks,\r\nbut they were by no means disposed to relinquish to those rivals the\r\ncommerce and the dominion of the coasts of the Mediterranean westward of\r\nItaly. For centuries the Carthaginians strove to make themselves masters\r\nof the islands that lie between Italy and Spain. They acquired the\r\nBalearic islands, where the principal harbour, Port Mahon, still bears\r\nthe name of the Carthaginian admiral. They succeeded in reducing the\r\ngreater part of Sardinia; but Sicily could never be brought into their\r\npower. They repeatedly invaded that island, and nearly overran it; but\r\nthe resistance which was opposed to them by the Syracusans under Gelon,\r\nDionysius, Timoleon, and Agathocles, preserved the island from becoming\r\nPunic, though many of its cities remained under the Carthaginian rule,\r\nuntil Rome finally settled the question to whom Sicily was to belong, by\r\nconquering it for herself.\r\n\r\nWith so many elements of success, with almost unbounded wealth with\r\ncommercial and maritime activity, with a fertile territory, with a\r\ncapital city of almost impregnable strength, with a constitution\r\nthat ensured for centuries the blessings of, social order, with an\r\naristocracy singularly fertile in men of the highest genius, Carthage\r\nyet failed signally and calamitously in her contest for power with Rome.\r\nOne of the immediate causes of this may seem to have been the want, of\r\nfirmness among her citizens, which made them terminate the first Punic\r\nwar by begging peace, sooner than endure any longer the hardships and\r\nburdens caused by a state of warfare, although their antagonists had\r\nsuffered far more severely than themselves. Another cause was the spirit\r\nof faction among their leading men, which prevented Hannibal in the\r\nsecond war from being properly reinforced and supported. But there were\r\nalso more general causes why Carthage proved inferior to Rome. These\r\nwere her position relatively to the mass of the inhabitants of the\r\ncountry which she ruled, and her habit of trusting to mercenary armies\r\nin her wars.\r\n\r\nOur clearest information as to the different races of men in and about\r\nCarthage is derived from Diodorus Siculus. [Vol. ii. p. 447, Wesseling's\r\ned.] That historian enumerates four different races: first, he\r\nmentions the Phoenicians who dwelt in Carthage: next, he speaks of the\r\nLiby-Phoenicians; these, he tells us, dwelt in many of the maritime\r\ncities, and were connected by intermarriages with the Phoenicians, which\r\nwas the cause of their compound name: thirdly, he mentions the Libyans,\r\nthe bulk and the most ancient part of the population, hating the\r\nCarthaginians intensely, on account of the oppressiveness of their\r\ndomination: lastly, he names the Numidians, the nomad tribes of the\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from this description, that the native Libyans were a\r\nsubject class, without franchise or political rights; and, accordingly,\r\nwe find no instance specified in history of a Libyan holding political\r\noffice or military command. The half-castes, the Liby-Phoenicians, seem\r\nto have been sometimes sent out as colonists; [See the \"Periplus\"\r\nof Hanno.] but it may be inferred, from what Diodorus says of their\r\nresidence, that they had not the right of the citizenship of Carthage:\r\nand only a solitary case occurs of one of this race being entrusted with\r\nauthority, and that, too, not emanating from the home government. This\r\nis the instance of the officer sent by Hannibal to Sicily, after the\r\nfall of Syracuse; whom Polybius [Lib. ix. 22.] calls Myttinus the\r\nLibyan, but whom, from the fuller account in Livy, we find to have been\r\na Liby-Phoenician [Lib. xxv. 40.] and it is expressly mentioned what\r\nindignation was felt by the Carthaginian commanders in the island that\r\nthis half-caste should control their operations.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the composition of their armies, it is observable that,\r\nthough thirsting for extended empire, and though some of the leading men\r\nbecame generals of the highest order, the Carthaginians, as a people,\r\nwere anything but personally warlike. As long as they could hire\r\nmercenaries to fight for them, they had little appetite for the irksome\r\ntraining, and they grudged the loss of valuable time, which military\r\nservice would have entailed on themselves.\r\n\r\nAs Michelet remarks, \"The life of an industrious merchant, of a\r\nCarthaginian, was too precious to be risked, as long as it was possible\r\nto substitute advantageously for it that of a barbarian from Spain or\r\nGaul. Carthage knew, and could tell to a drachma, what the life of a\r\nman of each nation came to. A Greek was worth more than a Campanian, a\r\nCampanian worth more than a Gaul or a Spaniard. When once this tariff\r\nof blood was correctly made out, Carthage began a war as a mercantile\r\nspeculation. She tried to make conquests in the hope of getting new\r\nmines to work, or to open fresh markets for her exports. In one venture\r\nshe could afford to spend fifty thousand mercenaries, in another, rather\r\nmore. If the returns were good, there was no regret felt for the capital\r\nthat had been lavished in the investment; more money got more men, and\r\nall went on well.\" [Histoire Romaine, vol. ii. p. 40.]\r\n\r\nArmies composed of foreign mercenaries have, in all ages, been as\r\nformidable to their employers as to the enemy against whom they were\r\ndirected. We know of one occasion (between the first and second Punic\r\nwars) when Carthage was brought to the very brink of destruction by a\r\nrevolt of her foreign troops. Other mutinies of the same kind must from\r\ntime to time have occurred. Probably one of these was the cause of the\r\ncomparative weakness of Carthage at the time of the Athenian expedition\r\nagainst Syracuse; so different from the energy with which she attacked\r\nGelon half a century earlier, and Dionysius half a century later. And\r\neven when we consider her armies with reference only to their efficiency\r\nin warfare, we perceive at once the inferiority of such bands of\r\ncondottieri, brought together without any common bond of origin,\r\ntactics, or cause, to the legions of Rome, which at the time of the\r\nPunic wars were raised from the very flower of a hardy agricultural\r\npopulation trained in the strictest discipline, habituated to victory,\r\nand animated by the most resolute patriotism. And this shows also\r\nthe transcendency of the genius of Hannibal, which could form such\r\ndiscordant materials into a compact organized force, and inspire them\r\nwith the spirit of patient discipline and loyalty to their chief; so\r\nthat they were true to him in his adverse as well as in his prosperous\r\nfortunes; and throughout the chequered series of his campaigns no panic\r\nrout ever disgraced a division under his command; no mutiny, or even\r\nattempt at mutiny, was ever known in his camp; and, finally, after\r\nfifteen years of Italian warfare, his men followed their old leader to\r\nZama, \"with no fear and little hope;\" [\"We advanced to Waterloo as the\r\nGreeks did to Thermopylae; all of us without fear and most of us without\r\nhope.\"--SPEECH OF GENERAL FOY.] and there, on that disastrous field,\r\nstood firm around him, his Old Guard, till Scipio's Numidian allies came\r\nup on their flank; when at last, surrounded and overpowered, the veteran\r\nbattalions sealed their devotion to their general with their blood.\r\n\r\n\"But if Hannibal's genius may be likened to the Homeric god, who, in his\r\nhatred to the Trojans, rises from the deep to rally the fainting Greeks,\r\nand to lead them against the enemy, so the calm courage with which\r\nHector met his more than human adversary in his country's cause, is\r\nno unworthy image of the unyielding magnanimity displayed by the\r\naristocracy of Rome. As Hannibal utterly eclipses Carthage, so, on the\r\ncontrary, Fabius, Marcellus, Claudius Nero, even Scipio himself, are as\r\nnothing when compared to the spirit, and wisdom, and power of Rome. The\r\nsenate, which voted its thanks to its political enemy, Varro, after his\r\ndisastrous defeat, 'because he had not despaired of the commonwealth,'\r\nand which disdained either to solicit, or to reprove, or to threaten,\r\nor in any way to notice the twelve colonies which had refused their\r\ncustomary supplies of men for the army, is far more to be honoured than\r\nthe conqueror of Zama. This we should the more carefully bear in mind\r\nbecause our tendency is to admire individual greatness far more than\r\nnational; and, as no single Roman will bear comparison to Hannibal, we\r\nare apt to murmur at the event of the contest, and to think that the\r\nvictory was awarded to the least worthy of the combatants. On the\r\ncontrary, never was the wisdom of God's Providence more manifest than in\r\nthe issue of the struggle between Rome and Carthage. It was clearly\r\nfor the good of man kind that Hannibal should be conquered: his triumph\r\nwould have stopped the progress of the world. For great men can only\r\nact permanently by forming great nations; and no one man, even though\r\nit were Hannibal himself, can in one generation effect such a work. But\r\nwhere the nation has been merely enkindled for a while by a great man's\r\nspirit, the light passes away with him who communicated it; and the\r\nnation, when he is gone, is like a dead body, to which magic power had,\r\nfor a moment, given unnatural life: when the charm has ceased, the body\r\nis cold and stiff as before. He who grieves over the battle of Zama\r\nshould carry on his thoughts to a period thirty years later, when\r\nHannibal must, in the course of nature, have been dead, and consider how\r\nthe isolated Phoenician city of Carthage was fitted to receive and to\r\nconsolidate the civilization of Greece, or by its laws and institutions\r\nto bind together barbarians of every race and language into an organized\r\nempire, and prepare them for becoming, when that empire was dissolved,\r\nthe free members of the commonwealth of Christian Europe.\" [Arnold, vol.\r\niii. p. 61. The above is one of the numerous bursts of eloquence that\r\nadorn Arnold's third volume, and cause such deep regret that that volume\r\nshould have been the last, and its great and good author have been cut\r\noff with his work thus incomplete.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring of 207 B.C. that Hasdrubal, after skilfully\r\ndisentangling himself from the Roman forces in Spain, and, after a march\r\nconducted with great judgment and little loss, through the interior of\r\nGaul and the passes of the Alps, appeared in the country that now is the\r\nnorth of Lombardy, at the head of troops which he had partly brought out\r\nof Spain, and partly levied among the Gauls and Ligurians on his way.\r\nAt this time Hannibal with his unconquered, and seemingly unconquerable\r\narmy, had been eleven years in Italy, executing with strenuous ferocity\r\nthe vow of hatred to Rome which had been sworn by him while yet a child\r\nat the bidding of his father, Hamilcar; who, as he boasted, had trained\r\nup his three sons, Hannibal, Hasdrubal, and Mago, Like three lion's\r\nwhelps, to prey upon the Romans. But Hannibal's latter campaigns had not\r\nbeen signalised by any such great victories as marked the first years\r\nof his invasion of Italy. The stern spirit of Roman resolution, ever\r\nhighest in disaster and danger, had neither bent nor despaired beneath\r\nthe merciless blows which \"the dire African\" dealt her in rapid\r\nsuccession at Trebia, at Thrasymene, and at Cannae. Her population was\r\nthinned by repeated slaughter in the field; poverty and actual scarcity\r\nwore down the survivors, through the fearful ravages which Hannibal's\r\ncavalry spread through their corn-fields, their pasture-lands, and their\r\nvineyards; many of her allies went over to the invader's side; and new\r\nclouds of foreign war threatened her from Macedonia and Gaul. But Rome\r\nreceded not. Rich and poor among her citizens vied with each other in\r\ndevotion to their country. The wealthy placed their stores, and all\r\nplaced their lives at the state's disposal. And though Hannibal could\r\nnot be driven out of Italy, though every year brought its sufferings and\r\nsacrifices, Rome felt that her constancy had not been exerted in vain.\r\nIf she was weakened by the continual strife, so was Hannibal also; and\r\nit was clear that the unaided resources of his army were unequal to the\r\ntask of her destruction. The single deer-hound could not pull down the\r\nquarry which he had so furiously assailed. Rome not only stood fiercely\r\nat bay, but had pressed back and gored her antagonist, that still,\r\nhowever, watched her in act to spring. She was weary, and bleeding at\r\nevery pore; and there seemed to be little hope of her escape, if the\r\nother hound of old Hamilcar's race should come up in time to aid his\r\nbrother in the death-grapple.\r\n\r\nHasdrubal had commanded the Carthaginian armies in Spain for some time,\r\nwith varying but generally unpropitious fortune. He had not the full\r\nauthority over the Punic forces in that country which his brother and\r\nhis father had previously exercised. The faction at Carthage, which was\r\nat feud with his family, succeeded in fettering and interfering with his\r\npower; and other generals were from time to time sent into Spain, whose\r\nerrors and misconduct caused the reverses that Hasdrubal met with.\r\nThis is expressly attested by the Greek historian Polybius, who was\r\nthe intimate friend of the younger Africanus, and drew his information\r\nrespecting the second Punic war from the best possible authorities.\r\nLivy gives a long narrative of campaigns between the Roman commanders\r\nin Spain and Hasdrubal, which is so palpably deformed by fictions and\r\nexaggerations as to be hardly deserving of attention. [See the excellent\r\ncriticisms of Sir Walter Raleigh on this, in his \"History of the World,\"\r\nbook v. chap. iii. sec. 11.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that in the year 208 B.C., at least, Hasdrubal outmanoeuvred\r\nPublius Scipio, who held the command of the Roman forces in Spain; and\r\nwhose object was to prevent him from passing the Pyrenees and marching\r\nupon Italy. Scipio expected that Hasdrubal would attempt the nearest\r\nroute, along the coast of the Mediterranean; and he therefore carefully\r\nfortified and guarded the passes of the eastern Pyrenees. But Hasdrubal\r\npassed these mountains near their western extremity; and then, with a\r\nconsiderable force of Spanish infantry, with a small number of African\r\ntroops, with some elephants and much treasure, he marched, not directly\r\ntowards the coast of the Mediterranean, but in a north-eastern line\r\ntowards the centre of Gaul. He halted for the winter in the territory\r\nof the Arverni, the modern Auvergne; and conciliated or purchased the\r\ngood-will of the Gauls in that region so far, that he not only found\r\nfriendly winter quarters among them, but great numbers of them enlisted\r\nunder him, and on the approach of spring marched with him to invade\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nBy thus entering Gaul at the south-west, and avoiding its southern\r\nmaritime districts, Hasdrubal kept the Romans in complete ignorance of\r\nhis precise operations and movements in that country; all that they knew\r\nwas that Hasdrubal had baffled Scipio's attempts to detain him in Spain;\r\nthat he had crossed the Pyrenees with soldiers, elephants, and money,\r\nand that he was raising fresh forces among the Gauls. The spring was\r\nsure to bring him into Italy; and then would come the real tempest of\r\nthe war, when from the north and from the south the two Carthaginian\r\narmies, each under a son of the Thunderbolt, were to gather together\r\naround the seven hills of Rome. [Hamilcar was surnamed Barca, which\r\nmeans the Thunderbolt. Sultan Bajazet had the similar surname of\r\nYilderim.]\r\n\r\nIn this emergency the Romans looked among themselves earnestly and\r\nanxiously for leaders fit to meet the perils of the coming campaign.\r\n\r\nThe senate recommended the people to elect, as one of their consuls,\r\nCaius Claudius Nero, a patrician of one of the families of the great\r\nClaudian house. Nero had served during the preceding years of the war,\r\nboth against Hannibal in Italy, and against Hasdrubal in Spain; but it\r\nis remarkable that the histories, which we possess, record no successes\r\nas having been achieved by him either before or after his great campaign\r\nof the Metaurus. It proves much for the sagacity of the leading men of\r\nthe senate, that they recognised in Nero the energy and spirit which\r\nwere required at this crisis, and it is equally creditable to the\r\npatriotism of the people, that they followed the advice of the senate by\r\nelecting a general who had no showy exploits to recommend him to their\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of greater difficulty to find a second consul; the laws\r\nrequired that one consul should be a plebeian; and the plebeian nobility\r\nhad been fearfully thinned by the events of the war. While the senators\r\nanxiously deliberated among themselves what fit colleague for Nero could\r\nbe nominated at the coming comitia, and sorrowfully recalled the\r\nnames of Marcellus, Gracchus, and other plebeian generals who were no\r\nmore--one taciturn and moody old man sat in sullen apathy among the\r\nconscript fathers. This was Marcus Livius, who had been consul in the\r\ngear before the beginning of this war, and had then gained a victory\r\nover the Illyrians. After his consulship he had been impeached before\r\nthe people on a charge of peculation and unfair division of the spoils\r\namong his soldiers: the verdict was unjustly given against him, and the\r\nsense of this wrong, and of the indignity thus put upon him, had rankled\r\nunceasingly in the bosom of Livius, so that for eight years after his\r\ntrial he had lived in seclusion at his country seat, taking no part in\r\nany affairs of state. Latterly the censors had compelled him to come to\r\nRome and resume his place in the senate, where he used to sit gloomily\r\napart, giving only a silent vote. At last an unjust accusation against\r\none of his near kinsmen made him break silence; and he harangued the\r\nhouse in words of weight and sense, which drew attention to him, and\r\ntaught the senators that a strong spirit dwelt beneath that unimposing\r\nexterior. Now, while they were debating on what noble of a plebeian\r\nhouse was fit to assume the perilous honours of the consulate, some of\r\nthe elder of them looked on Marcus Livius, and remembered that in the\r\nvery last triumph which had been celebrated in the streets of Rome this\r\ngrim old man had sat in the car of victory; and that he had offered the\r\nlast grand thanksgiving sacrifice for the success of the Roman arms\r\nthat had bled before Capitoline Jove. There had been no triumphs since\r\nHannibal came into Italy. [Marcellus had been only allowed an ovation\r\nfor the conquest of Syracuse.] The Illyrian campaign of Livius was the\r\nlast that had been so honoured; perhaps it might be destined for him now\r\nto renew the long-interrupted series. The senators resolved that Livius\r\nshould be put in nomination as consul with Nero; the people were willing\r\nto elect him; the only opposition came from himself. He taunted them\r\nwith their inconsistency is honouring a man they had convicted of a base\r\ncrime. \"If I am innocent,\" said he, \"why did you place such a stain on\r\nme? If I am guilty, why am I more fit for a second consulship than I was\r\nfor my first one?\" The other senators remonstrated with him urging the\r\nexample of the great Camillus, who, after an unjust condemnation on a\r\nsimilar charge, both served and saved his country. At last Livius ceased\r\nto object; and Caius Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius were chosen consuls\r\nof Rome.\r\n\r\nA quarrel had long existed between the two consuls, and the senators\r\nstrove to effect a reconciliation between them before the campaign.\r\nHere again Livius for a long time obstinately resisted the wish of his\r\nfellow-senators. He said it was best for the state that he and Nero\r\nshould continue to hate one another. Each would do his duty better,\r\nwhen he knew that he was watched by an enemy in the person of his own\r\ncolleague. At last the entreaties of the senators prevailed, and Livius\r\nconsented to forego the feud, and to co-operate with Nero in preparing\r\nfor the coming struggle.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the winter snows were thawed, Hasdrubal commenced his march\r\nfrom Auvergne to the Alps. He experienced none of the difficulties which\r\nhis brother had met with from the mountain tribes. Hannibal's army\r\nhad been the first body of regular troops that had ever traversed the\r\nregions; and, as wild animals assail a traveller, the natives rose\r\nagainst it instinctively, in imagined defence of their own habitations,\r\nwhich they supposed to be the objects of Carthaginian ambition. But\r\nthe fame of the war, with which Italy had now been convulsed for eleven\r\nyears, had penetrated into the Alpine passes; and the mountaineers\r\nunderstood that a mighty city, southward of the Alps, was to be attacked\r\nby the troops whom they saw marching among them. They not only opposed\r\nno resistance to the passage of Hasdrubal, but many of them, out of\r\nthe love of enterprise and plunder, or allured by the high pay that he\r\noffered, took service with him; and thus he advanced upon Italy with an\r\narmy that gathered strength at every league. It is said, also, that some\r\nof the most important engineering works which Hannibal had constructed,\r\nwere found by Hasdrubal still in existence, and materially favoured the\r\nspeed of his advance. He thus emerged into Italy from the Alpine valleys\r\nmuch sooner than had been anticipated. Many warriors of the Ligurian\r\ntribes joined him; and, crossing the river Po, he marched down its\r\nsouthern bank to the city of Placentia, which he wished to secure as a\r\nbase for his future operations. Placentia resisted him as bravely as it\r\nhad resisted Hannibal eleven years before; and for some time Hasdrubal\r\nwas occupied with a fruitless siege before its walls.\r\n\r\nSix armies were levied for the defence of Italy when the long-dreaded\r\napproach of Hasdrubal was announced. Seventy thousand Romans served in\r\nthe fifteen legions of which, with an equal number of Italian allies,\r\nthose armies and the garrisons were composed. Upwards of thirty thousand\r\nmore Romans were serving in Sicily, Sardinia, and Spain. The whole\r\nnumber of Roman citizens of an age fit for military duty scarcely\r\nexceeded a hundred and thirty thousand. The census taken before the war\r\nhad shown a total of two hundred and seventy thousand, which had been\r\ndiminished by more than half during twelve years. These numbers are\r\nfearfully emphatic of the extremity to which Rome was reduced, and of\r\nher gigantic efforts in that great agony of her fate. Not merely men,\r\nbut money and military stores, were drained to the utmost; and if\r\nthe armies of that year should be swept off by a repetition of the\r\nslaughters of Thrasymene and Cannae, all felt that Rome would cease to\r\nexist. Even if the campaign were to be marked by no decisive success on\r\neither side, her ruin seemed certain. In South Italy Hannibal had either\r\ndetached Rome's allies from her, or had impoverished them by the ravages\r\nof his army. If Hasdrubal could have done the same in Upper Italy; if\r\nEtruria, Umbria, and Northern Latium had either revolted or been laid\r\nwaste, Rome must have sunk beneath sheer starvation; for the hostile\r\nor desolated territory would have yielded no supplies of corn for her\r\npopulation; and money, to purchase it from abroad, there was none.\r\nInstant victory was a matter of life and death. Three of her six armies\r\nwere ordered to the north, but the first of these was required to\r\noverawe the disaffected Etruscans. The second army of the north was\r\npushed forward, under Porcius, the praetor, to meet and keep in, check\r\nthe advanced troops of Hasdrubal; while the third, the grand army of the\r\nnorth, which was to be under the immediate command of the consul Livius,\r\nwho had the chief command in all North Italy, advanced more slowly in\r\nits support. There were similarly three armies in the south, under the\r\norders of the other consul Claudius Nero.\r\n\r\nThe lot had decided that Livius was to be opposed to Hasdrubal, and\r\nthat Nero should face Hannibal. And \"when all was ordered as themselves\r\nthought best, the two consuls went forth of the city; each his several\r\nway. The people of Rome were now quite otherwise affected, than they had\r\nbeen, when L. AEmilius Paulus and C. Tarentius Varro were sent against\r\nHannibal. They did no longer take upon them to direct their generals, or\r\nbid them dispatch, and win the victory betimes; but rather they stood\r\nin fear, lest all diligence, wisdom, and valour should prove too little.\r\nFor since, few years had passed, wherein some one of their generals\r\nhad not been slain; and since it was manifest, that if either of\r\nthese present consuls were defeated, or put to the worst, the two\r\nCarthaginians would forthwith join, and make short work with the other:\r\nit seemed a greater happiness than could be expected, that each of them\r\nshould return home victor; and come off with honour from such mighty\r\nopposition as he was like to find. With extreme difficulty had Rome held\r\nup her head ever since the battle of Cannae; though it were so, that\r\nHannibal alone, with little help from Carthage, had continued the war in\r\nItaly. But there was now arrived another son of Amilcar; and one that,\r\nin his present expedition, had seemed a man of more sufficiency than\r\nHannibal himself. For, whereas in that long and dangerous march through\r\nbarbarous nations, over great rivers and mountains, that were thought\r\nunpassable, Hannibal had lost a great part of his army; this Asdrubal,\r\nin the same places, had multiplied his numbers; and gathering the\r\npeople that he found in the way, descended from the Alps like a rolling\r\nsnow-ball, far greater than he came over the Pyrenees at his first\r\nsetting out of Spain. These considerations, and the like, of which fear\r\npresented many unto them, caused the people of Rome to wait upon their\r\nconsuls out of the town, like a pensive train of mourners; thinking upon\r\nMarcellus and Crispinus, upon whom, in the like sort, they had given\r\nattendance the last year, but saw neither of them return alive from\r\na less dangerous war. Particularly old Q. Fabius gave his accustomed\r\nadvice to M. Livius, that he should abstain from giving or taking\r\nbattle, until he well understood the enemies' condition. But the consul\r\nmade him a froward answer, and said, that he would fight the very first\r\nday, for that he thought it long till he should either recover his\r\nhonour by victory, or, by seeing the overthrow of his own unjust\r\ncitizens, satisfy himself with the joy of a great, though not an\r\nhonest revenge. But his meaning was better than his words.\" [Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh.]\r\n\r\nHannibal at this period occupied with his veteran but much reduced\r\nforces the extreme south of Italy. It had not been expected either by\r\nfriend or foe, that Hasdrubal would effect his passage of the Alps so\r\nearly in the year as actually occurred. And even when Hannibal learned\r\nthat his brother was in Italy, and had advanced as far as Placentia,\r\nhe was obliged to pause for further intelligence, before he himself\r\ncommenced active operations, as he could not tell whether his brother\r\nmight not be invited into Etruria, to aid the party there that was\r\ndisaffected to Rome or whether he would march down by the Adriatic Sea.\r\nHannibal led his troops out of their winter quarters in Bruttium, and\r\nmarched northward as far as Canusium. Nero had his head-quarters near\r\nVenusia, with an army which he had increased to forty thousand foot and\r\ntwo thousand five hundred horse, by incorporating under his own command\r\nsome of the legions which had been intended to set under other generals\r\nin the south. There was another Roman army twenty thousand strong, south\r\nof Hannibal, at Tarentum. The strength of that city secured this Roman\r\nforce from any attack by Hannibal, and it was a serious matter to march\r\nnorthward and leave it in his rear, free to act against all his depots\r\nand allies in the friendly part of Italy, which for the last two or\r\nthree campaigns had served him for a base of his operations. Moreover,\r\nNero's army was so strong that Hannibal could not concentrate troops\r\nenough to assume the offensive against it without weakening his\r\ngarrisons, and relinquishing, at least for a time, his grasp upon the\r\nsouthern provinces. To do this before he was certainly informed of his\r\nbrother's operations would have been an useless sacrifice; as Nero could\r\nretreat before him upon the other Roman armies near the capital, and\r\nHannibal knew by experience that a mere advance of his army upon the\r\nwalls of Rome would have no effect on the fortunes of the war. In\r\nthe hope, probably, of inducing Nero to follow him, and of gaining an\r\nopportunity of outmanoeuvring the Roman consul and attacking him on his\r\nmarch, Hannibal moved into Lucania, and then back into Apulis;--he\r\nagain marched down into Bruttium, and strengthened his army by a levy of\r\nrecruits in that district. Nero followed him, but gave him no chance of\r\nassailing him at a disadvantage. Some partial encounters seem to have\r\ntaken place; but the consul could not prevent Hannibal's junction\r\nwith his Bruttian levies, nor could Hannibal gain an opportunity of\r\nsurprising and crushing the consul. Hannibal returned to his former\r\nhead-quarters at Canusium, and halted there in expectation of further\r\ntidings of his brother's movements. Nero also resumed his former\r\nposition in observation of the Carthaginian army.\r\n\r\n[The annalists whom Livy copied, spoke of Nero's gaining repeated\r\nvictories over Hannibal, and killing; and taking his men by tens of\r\nthousands. The falsehood of all this is self-evident. If Nero could thus\r\nalways beat Hannibal, the Romans would not have been in such an agony\r\nof dread about Hasdrubal, as all writers describe. Indeed, we have the\r\nexpress testimony of Polybius that such statements as we read in Livy\r\nof Marcellus, Nero, and others gaining victories over Hannibal in Italy,\r\nmust be all fabrications of Roman vanity. Polybius states (Lib. xv. sec.\r\n16) that Hannibal was never defeated before the battle of Zama; and in\r\nanother passage (Book ix. chap, 3) he mentions that after the defeats\r\nwhich Hannibal inflicted on the Romans in the early years of the war,\r\nthey no longer dared face his army in a pitched battle on a fair field,\r\nand yet they resolutely maintained the war. He rightly explains this by\r\nreferring to the superiority of Hannibal's cavalry the arm which gained\r\nhim all his victories. By keeping within fortified lines, or close to\r\nthe sides of the mountains when Hannibal approached them, the Romans\r\nrendered his cavalry ineffective; and a glance at the geography of Italy\r\nwill show how an army can traverse the greater part of that country\r\nwithout venturing far from the high grounds.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Hasdrubal had raised the siege of Placentia, and was\r\nadvancing towards Ariminum on the Adriatic, and driving before him the\r\nRoman army under Porcina. Nor when the consul Livius had come up, and\r\nunited the second and third armies of the north, could he make head\r\nagainst the invaders. The Romans still fell back before Hasdrubal,\r\nbeyond Ariminum, beyond the Metaurus, and as far as the little town of\r\nSena, to the southeast of that river. Hasdrubal was not unmindful of the\r\nnecessity of acting in concert with his brother. He sent messengers\r\nto Hannibal to announce his own line of march and to propose that they\r\nshould unite their armies in South Umbria, and then wheel round against\r\nRome. Those messengers traversed the greater part of Italy in safety;\r\nbut, when close to the object of their mission, were captured by a Roman\r\ndetachment; and Hasdrubal's letter, detailing his whole plan of the\r\ncampaign, was laid, not in his brother's hands, but in those of the\r\ncommander of the Roman armies of the south. Nero saw at once the full\r\nimportance of the crisis. The two sons of Hamilcar were now within two\r\nhundred miles of each other, and if Rome were to be saved, the brothers\r\nmust never meet alive. Nero instantly ordered seven thousand picked men,\r\na thousand being cavalry, to hold themselves in readiness for a secret\r\nexpedition against one of Hannibal's garrisons; and as soon as night had\r\nset in, he hurried forward on his bold enterprise: but he quickly left\r\nthe southern road towards Lucania, and wheeling round, pressed northward\r\nwith the utmost rapidity towards Picenum. He had, during the preceding\r\nafternoon, sent messengers to Rome, who were to lay Hasdrubal's letters\r\nbefore the senate. There was a law forbidding a consul to make war or to\r\nmarch his army beyond the limits of the province assigned to him; but in\r\nsuch an emergency Nero did not wait for the permission of the senate to\r\nexecute his project, but informed them that he was already on his\r\nmarch to join Livius against Hasdrubal. He advised them to send the two\r\nlegions which formed the home garrison, on to Narnia, so as to defend\r\nthat pass of the Flaminian road against Hasdrubal, in case he should\r\nmarch upon Rome before the consular armies could attack him. They were\r\nto supply the place of those two legions at Rome by a levy EN MASSE in\r\nthe city, and by ordering up the reserve legion from Capua. These were\r\nhis communications to the senate. He also sent horseman forward along\r\nhis line of march, with orders to the local authorities to bring stores\r\nof; provisions and refreshments of every kind to the road-side, and\r\nto have relays of carriages ready for the conveyance of the wearied\r\nsoldiers. Such were the precautions which he took for accelerating his\r\nmarch; and when he had advanced some little distance from his camp, he\r\nbriefly informed his soldiers of the real object of their expedition.\r\nHe told them that there never was a design more seemingly audacious, and\r\nmore really safe. He said he was leading them to a certain victory, for\r\nhis colleague had an army large enough to balance the enemy already, so\r\nthat THEIR swords would decisively turn the scale. The very rumour\r\nthat a fresh consul and a fresh army had come up, when heard on the\r\nbattle-field (and he would take care that they should not be heard of\r\nbefore they were seen and felt) would settle the campaign. They would\r\nhave all the credit of the victory, and of having dealt the final\r\ndecisive blow, He appealed to the enthusiastic reception which they\r\nalready met with on their line of march as a proof and an omen of their\r\ngood fortune. [Livy. lib. xxvii. c. 45.] And, indeed, their whole path\r\nwas amidst the vows and prayers and praises of their countrymen. The\r\nentire population of the districts through which they passed, flocked\r\nto the road-side to see and bless the deliverers of their country. Food,\r\ndrink, and refreshments of every kind were eagerly pressed on their\r\nacceptance. Each peasant thought a favour was conferred on him, if one\r\nof Nero's chosen band would accept aught at his hands. The soldiers\r\ncaught the full spirit of their leader. Night and day they marched\r\nforwards, taking their hurried meals in the ranks and resting by relays\r\nin the waggons which the zeal of the country-people provided, and which\r\nfollowed in the rear of the column.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at Rome, the news of Nero's expedition had caused the\r\ngreatest excitement and alarm. All men felt the full audacity of the\r\nenterprise, but hesitated what epithet to apply to it. It was evident\r\nthat Nero's conduct would be judged of by the event, that most unfair\r\ncriterion, as the Roman historian truly terms it. [\"Adparebat (quo nihil\r\niniquius est) ex eventu famam habiturum.\"--LIVY, lib. xxvii. c. 44.]\r\nPeople reasoned on the perilous state in which Nero had left the rest of\r\nhis army, without a general, and deprived of the core of its strength,\r\nin the vicinity of the terrible Hannibal. They speculated on how long\r\nit would take Hannibal to pursue and overtake Nero himself, and his\r\nexpeditionary force. They talked over the former disasters of the war,\r\nand the fall of both the consuls of the last year. All these calamities\r\nhad come on them while they had only one Carthaginian general and army\r\nto deal with in Italy. Now they had two Punic wars at one time. They\r\nhad two Carthaginian armies; they had almost two Hannibals in Italy,\r\nHasdrubal was sprung from the same father; trained up in the same\r\nhostility to Rome; equally practised in battle against its legions; and,\r\nif the comparative speed and success with which he had crossed the Alps\r\nwas a fair test, he was even a better general than his brother. With\r\nfear for their interpreter of every rumour, they exaggerated the\r\nstrength of their enemy's forces in every quarter, and criticised and\r\ndistrusted their own.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Rome, while she was thus a prey to terror and anxiety,\r\nher consul's nerves were strong, and he resolutely urged on his march\r\ntowards Sena, where his colleague, Livius, and the praetor Portius were\r\nencamped; Hasdrubal's army being in position about half a mile to the\r\nnorth. Nero had sent couriers forward to apprise his colleague of his\r\nproject and of his approach; and by the advice of Livius, Nero so timed\r\nhis final march as to reach the camp at Sena by night. According to a\r\nprevious arrangement, Nero's men were received silently into the tents\r\nof their comrades, each according to his rank. By these means there was\r\nno enlargement of the camp that could betray to Hasdrubal the accession\r\nof force which the Romans had received. This was considerable; as Nero's\r\nnumbers had been increased on the march by the volunteers, who offered\r\nthemselves in crowds, and from whom he selected the most promising men,\r\nand especially the veterans of former campaigns. A council of war was\r\nheld on the morning after his arrival, in which some advised that time\r\nshould be given for Nero's men to refresh themselves, after the fatigue\r\nof such a march. But Nero vehemently opposed all delay. \"The officer,\"\r\nsaid he, \"who is for giving time for my men here to rest themselves, is\r\nfor giving time to Hannibal to attack my men, whom I have left in the\r\ncamp in Apulia. He is for giving time to Hannibal and Hasdrubal to\r\ndiscover my march, and to manoeuvre for a junction with each other in\r\nCisalpine Gaul at their leisure. We must fight instantly, while both the\r\nfoe here and the foe in the south are ignorant of our movements. We must\r\ndestroy this Hasdrubal, and I must be back In Apulia before Hannibal\r\nawakes from his torpor.\" [Livy, lib. xxvii. c. 45.] Nero's advice\r\nprevailed. It was resolved to fight directly; and before the consuls and\r\npraetor left the tent of Livius, the red ensign, which was the signal to\r\nprepare for immediate action, was hoisted, and the Romans forthwith drew\r\nup in battle array outside the camp.\r\n\r\nHasdrubal had been anxious to bring Livius and Porcius to battle, though\r\nhe had not judged it expedient to attack them in their lines. And now,\r\non hearing that the Romans offered battle, he also drew up his men, and\r\nadvanced towards them. No spy or deserter had informed him of Nero's\r\narrival; nor had he received any direct information that he had more\r\nthan his old enemies to deal with. But as he rode forward to reconnoitre\r\nthe Roman lines, he thought that their numbers seemed to have increased,\r\nand that the armour of some-of them was unusually dull and stained. He\r\nnoticed also that the horses of some of the cavalry appeared to be rough\r\nand out of condition, as if they had just come from a succession of\r\nforced marches. So also, though, owing to the precaution of Livius, the\r\nRoman camp showed no change of size, it had not escaped the quick ear of\r\nthe Carthaginian general, that the trumpet, which gave the signal to\r\nthe Roman legions, sounded that morning once oftener than usual, as if\r\ndirecting the troops of some additional superior officer. Hasdrubal,\r\nfrom his Spanish campaigns, was well acquainted with all the sounds\r\nand signals of Roman war; and from all that he heard and saw, he felt\r\nconvinced that both the Roman consuls were before him. In doubt and\r\ndifficulty as to what might have taken place between the armies of the\r\nsouth, and probably hoping that Hannibal also was approaching, Hasdrubal\r\ndetermined to avoid an encounter with the combined Roman forces, and\r\nto endeavour to retreat upon Insubrian Gaul, where he would be in a\r\nfriendly country, and could endeavour to re-open his communications with\r\nhis brother. He therefore led his troops back into their camp; and, as\r\nthe Romans did not venture on an assault upon his entrenchments, and\r\nHasdrubal did not choose to commence his retreat in their sight, the day\r\npassed away in inaction. At the first watch of the night, Hasdrubal led\r\nhis men silently out of their camp, and moved northwards towards the\r\nMetaurus, in the hope of placing that river between himself and the\r\nRomans before his retreat was discovered. His guides betrayed him;\r\nand having purposely led him away from the part of the river that was\r\nfordable, they made their escape in the dark, and left Hasdrubal and his\r\narmy wandering in confusion along the steep bank, and seeking in vain\r\nfor a spot where the stream could be safely crossed. At last they\r\nhalted; and when day dawned on them, Hasdrubal found that great numbers\r\nof his men, in their fatigue and impatience, had lost all discipline and\r\nsubordination, and that many of his Gallic auxiliaries had got drunk,\r\nand were lying helpless in their quarters. The Roman cavalry was soon\r\nseen coming up in pursuit, followed at no great distance by the legions,\r\nwhich marched in readiness for an instant engagement. It was hopeless\r\nfor Hasdrubal, to think of continuing his retreat before them. The\r\nprospect of immediate battle might recall the disordered part of his\r\ntroops to a sense of duty, and revive the instinct of discipline. He\r\ntherefore ordered his men to prepare for action instantly, and made the\r\nbest arrangement of them that the nature of the ground would permit.\r\n\r\nHeeren has well described the general appearance of a Carthaginian army.\r\nHe says: \"It was an assemblage of the most opposite races of the human\r\nspecies, from the farthest parts of the globe. Hordes of half-naked\r\nGauls were ranged next to companies of white clothed Iberians, and\r\nsavage Ligurians next to the far-travelled Nasamones and Lotophagi.\r\nCarthaginians and Phoenici-Africans formed the centre; while innumerable\r\ntroops of Numidian horse-men, taken from all the tribes of the Desert,\r\nswarmed about on unsaddled horses, and formed the wings; the van was\r\ncomposed of Balearic slingers; and a line of colossal elephants, with\r\ntheir Ethiopian guides, formed, as it were, a chain of moving fortresses\r\nbefore the whole army. Such were the usual materials and arrangements of\r\nthe hosts that fought for Carthage; but the troops under Hasdrubal were\r\nnot in all respects thus constituted or thus stationed. He seems to have\r\nbeen especially deficient in cavalry, and he had few African troops,\r\nthough some Carthaginians of high rank were with him. His veteran\r\nSpanish infantry, armed with helmets and shields, and short\r\ncut-and-thrust swords, were the best part of his army. These, and his\r\nfew Africans, he drew up on his right wing, under his own personal\r\ncommand. In the centre, he placed his Ligurian infantry, and on the left\r\nwing he placed or retained the Gauls, who were armed with long javelins\r\nand with huge broadswords and targets. The rugged nature of the ground\r\nin front and on the flank of this part of his line, made him hope that\r\nthe Roman right wing would be unable to come to close quarters with\r\nthese unserviceable barbarians, before he could make some impression\r\nwith his Spanish veterans on the Roman left. This was the only chance\r\nthat he had of victory or safety, and he seems to have done everything\r\nthat good generalship could do to secure it. He placed his elephants in\r\nadvance of his centre and right wing. He had caused the driver of each\r\nof them to be provided with a sharp iron spike and a mallet; and had\r\ngiven orders that every beast that became unmanageable, and ran back\r\nupon his own ranks, should be instantly killed, by driving the spike\r\ninto the vertebra at the junction of the head and the spine. Hasdrubal's\r\nelephants were ten in number. We have no trustworthy information as to\r\nthe amount of his infantry, but it is quite clear that he was greatly\r\noutnumbered by the combined Roman forces.\"\r\n\r\nThe tactic of the Roman legions had not yet acquired the perfection\r\nwhich it received from the military genius of Marius, [Most probably\r\nduring the period of his prolonged consulship, from B.C. 104 to B.C.\r\n101, while he was training his army against the Cimbri and the Teutons.]\r\nand which we read of in the first chapter of Gibbon. We possess in\r\nthat great work an account of the Roman legions at the end of the\r\ncommonwealth, and during the early ages of the empire, which those alone\r\ncan adequately admire, who have attempted a similar description. We\r\nhave also, in the sixth and seventeenth books of Polybius, an elaborate\r\ndiscussion on the military system of the Romans in his time, which was\r\nnot far distant from the time of the battle of the Metaurus. But the\r\nsubject is beset with difficulties: and instead of entering into minute\r\nbut inconclusive details, I would refer to Gibbon's first chapter, as\r\nserving for a general description of the Roman army in its period of\r\nperfection; and remark, that the training and armour which the whole\r\nlegion received in the time of Augustus, was, two centuries earlier,\r\nonly partially introduced. Two divisions of troops, called Hastati and\r\nPrincipes, formed the bulk of each Roman legion in the second Punic war.\r\nEach of these divisions was twelve hundred strong. The Hastatus and the\r\nPrinceps legionary bore a breast-plate or coat of mail, brazen greaves,\r\nand a brazen helmet, with a lofty, upright crest of scarlet or black\r\nfeathers. He had a large oblong shield; and, as weapons of offence, two\r\njavelins, one of which was light and slender, but the other was a strong\r\nand massive weapon, with a shaft about four feet long, and an iron head\r\nof equal length. The sword was carried on the right thigh, and was a\r\nshort cut-and thrust weapon, like that which was used by the Spaniards.\r\nThus armed, the Hastati formed the front division of the legion, and the\r\nPrincipes the second. Each division was drawn up about ten deep; a space\r\nof three feet being allowed between the files as well as the ranks, so\r\nas to give each legionary ample room for the use of his javelins, and\r\nof his sword and shield. The men in the second rank did not stand\r\nimmediately behind those in the first rank, but the files were\r\nalternate, like the position of the men on a draught board. This was\r\ntermed the quincunx order. Niebuhr considers that this arrangement\r\nenabled the legion to keep up a shower of javelins on the enemy for some\r\nconsiderable time. He says: \"When the first line had hurled its pila,\r\nit probably stepped back between those who stood behind it, who with\r\ntwo steps forward restored the front nearly to its first position; a\r\nmovement which, on account of the arrangement of the quincunx, could be\r\nexecuted without losing a moment. Thus one line succeeded the other in\r\nthe front till it was time to draw the swords; nay, when it was found\r\nexpedient, the lines which had already been in the front might repeat\r\nthis change, since the stores of pila were surely not confined to the\r\ntwo which each soldier took with him into battle.\r\n\r\n\"The same change must have taken place in fighting with the sword;\r\nwhich, when the same tactic was adopted on both sides, was anything but\r\na confused MELEE; on the contrary, it was a series of single combats.\"\r\nHe adds, that a military man of experience had been consulted by him on\r\nthe subject, and had given it as his opinion, \"that the change of the\r\nlines as described above was by no means impracticable; and in the\r\nabsence of the deafening noise of gunpowder, it cannot have had even any\r\ndifficulty with trained troops.\"\r\n\r\nThe third division of the legion was six hundred strong, and acted as a\r\nreserve. It was always composed of veteran soldiers, who were called the\r\nTriarii. Their arms were the same as those of the Principes and Hastati;\r\nexcept that each Triarian carried a spear instead of javelins. The rest\r\nof the legion consisted of light armed troops, who acted as skirmishers.\r\nThe cavalry of each legion was at this period about three hundred\r\nstrong. The Italian allies, who were attached to the legion, seem to\r\nhave been similarly armed and equipped, but their numerical proportion\r\nof cavalry was much larger.\r\n\r\nSuch was the nature of the forces that advanced on the Roman side to the\r\nbattle of the Metaurus. Nero commanded the right wing, Livius the left,\r\nand the praetor Porcius had the command of the centre. \"Both Romans and\r\nCarthaginians well understood how much depended upon the fortune of this\r\nday, and how little hope of safety there was for the vanquished. Only\r\nthe Romans herein seemed to have had the better in conceit and opinion,\r\nthat they were to fight with men desirous to have fled from them. And\r\naccording to this presumption came Livius the consul, with a proud\r\nbravery, to give charge on the Spaniards and Africans, by whom he was so\r\nsharply entertained that victory seemed very doubtful. The Africans and\r\nSpaniards were stout soldiers, and well acquainted with the manner\r\nof the Roman fight. The Ligurians, also, were a hardy nation, and not\r\naccustomed to give ground; which they needed the less, or were able now\r\nto do, being placed in the midst. Livius, therefore, and Porcius found\r\ngreat opposition; and, with great slaughter on both sides, prevailed\r\nlittle or nothing. Besides other difficulties, they were exceedingly\r\ntroubled by the elephants, that brake their first ranks, and put them in\r\nsuch disorder, as the Roman ensigns were driven to fall back; all this\r\nwhile Claudius Nero, labouring in vain against a steep hill, was unable\r\nto come to blows with the Gauls that stood opposite him, but out of\r\ndanger. This made Hasdrubal the more confident, who, seeing his own left\r\nwing safe, did the more boldly and fiercely make impression on the other\r\nside upon the left wing of the Romans.\" [\"Historie of the World,\" by Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh, p. 946.]\r\n\r\nBut at last Nero, who found that Hasdrubal refused his left wing, and\r\nwho could not overcome the difficulties of the ground in the quarter\r\nassigned to him, decided the battle by another stroke of that military\r\ngenius which had inspired his march. Wheeling a brigade of his best men\r\nround the rear of the rest of the Roman army, Nero fiercely charged the\r\nflank of the Spaniards and Africans. The charge was as successful as it\r\nwas sudden. Rolled back in disorder upon each other, and overwhelmed\r\nby numbers, the Spaniards and Ligurians died, fighting gallantly to the\r\nlast. The Gauls, who had taken little or no part in the strife of the\r\nday, were then surrounded, and butchered almost without resistance.\r\nHasdrubal, after having, by the confession of his enemies, done all that\r\na general could do, when he saw that the victory was irreparably lost,\r\nscorning to survive the gallant; host which he had led, and to gratify,\r\nas a captive, Roman cruelty and pride, spurred his horse into the midst\r\nof a Roman cohort; where, sword in hand, he met the death that was\r\nworthy of the son of Hamilcar and the brother of Hannibal.\r\n\r\nSuccess the most complete had crowned Nero's enterprise. Returning as\r\nrapidly as he had advanced, he was again facing the inactive enemies in\r\nthe south, before they even knew of his march. But he brought with him\r\na ghastly trophy of what he had done. In the true spirit of that savage\r\nbrutality which deformed the Roman national character, Nero ordered\r\nHasdrubal's head to be flung into his brother's camp. Eleven years had\r\npassed since Hannibal had last gazed on those features. The sons of\r\nHamilcar had then planned their system of warfare against Rome, which\r\nthey had so nearly brought to successful accomplishment. Year after year\r\nhad Hannibal been struggling in Italy, in the hope of one day hailing\r\nthe arrival of him whom he had left in Spain; and of seeing his\r\nbrother's eye flash with affection and pride at the junction of their\r\nirresistible hosts. He now saw that eye glazed in death and, in the\r\nagony of his heart, the great Carthaginian groaned aloud that he\r\nrecognised his country's destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Carthagini jam non ego nuntios\r\n      Mittam superbos.  Occidit, occidit\r\n      Spes omnis et fortuna nostri\r\n      Nominis, Hastrubale interemto.--HORACE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRome was almost delirious with joy: [See the splendid description in\r\nLivy, lib. xxvii. sec. 50, 51.] so agonising had been the suspense with\r\nwhich the battle's verdict on that great issue of a nation's life and\r\ndeath had been awaited; so overpowering was the sudden reaction to the\r\nconsciousness of security, and to the full glow of glory and success.\r\nFrom the time when it had been known at Rome that the armies were in\r\npresence of each other, the people had never ceased to throng the forum,\r\nthe Conscript Fathers had been in permanent sitting at the senate house.\r\nEver and anon a fearful whisper crept among the crowd of a second Cannae\r\nwon by a second Hannibal. Then came truer rumours that the day was\r\nRome's; but the people were sick at heart, and heeded them not. The\r\nshrines were thronged with trembling women, who seemed to weary heaven\r\nwith prayers to shield them from the brutal Gaul and the savage African.\r\nPresently the reports of good fortune assumed a more definite form. It\r\nwas said that two Narnian horseman had ridden from the east into the\r\nRoman camp of observation in Umbria, and had brought tidings of the\r\nutter slaughter of the foe. Such news seemed too good to be true,\r\nMen tortured their neighbours and themselves by demonstrating its\r\nimprobability and by ingeniously criticising its evidence. Soon,\r\nhowever, a letter came from Lucius Manlius Acidinus, who commanded in\r\nUmbria, and who announced the arrival of the Narnian horsemen in his\r\ncamp, and the intelligence which they brought thither. The letter\r\nwas first laid before the senate, and then before the assembly of the\r\npeople. The excitement grew more and more vehement. The letter was read\r\nand re-read aloud to thousands. It confirmed the previous rumour. But\r\neven this was insufficient to allay the feverish anxiety that thrilled\r\nthrough every breast in Rome. The letter might be a forgery: the Narnian\r\nhorseman might be traitors or impostors. \"We must see officers from the\r\narmy that fought, or hear despatches from the consuls themselves, and\r\nthen only will we believe.\" Such was the public sentiment, though some\r\nof more hopeful nature already permitted themselves a foretaste of joy.\r\nAt length came news that officers who really had been in the battle were\r\nnear at hand. Forthwith the whole city poured forth to meet them, each\r\nperson coveting to be the first to receive with his own eyes and ears\r\nconvincing proofs of the reality of such a deliverance. One vast throng\r\nof human beings filled the road from Rome to the Milvian bridge. The\r\nthree officers, Lucius Veturius Pollio, Publius Licinius Vasus, and\r\nQuintus Caecilius Metellus came riding on, making their way slowly\r\nthrough the living sea around them, As they advanced, each told the\r\nsuccessive waves of eager questioners that Rome was victorious. \"We have\r\ndestroyed Hasdrubal and his army, our legions are safe, and our consuls\r\nare unhurt.\" Each happy listener, who caught the welcome sounds from\r\ntheir lips, retired to communicate his own joy to others, and became\r\nhimself the centre of an anxious and inquiring group. When the officers\r\nhad, with much difficulty, reached the senate house, and the crowd was\r\nwith still greater difficulty put back from entering and mingling with\r\nthe Conscript Fathers, the despatches of Livius and Nero were produced\r\nand read aloud. From the senate house the officers proceeded to the\r\npublic assembly, where the despatches were read again; and then the\r\nsenior officer, Lucius Veturius, gave in his own words a fuller detail\r\nof how went the fight. When he had done speaking to the people,\r\nan universal shout of rapture rent the air. The vast assembly then\r\nseparated: some hastening to the temples to find in devotion a vent for\r\nthe overflowing excitement of their hearts; others seeking their homes\r\nto gladden their wives and children with the good news, and to feast\r\ntheir own eyes with the sight of the loved ones, who now, at last, were\r\nsafe from outrage and slaughter. The senate ordained a thanksgiving of\r\nthree days for the great deliverance which had been vouchsafed to Rome;\r\nand throughout that period the temples were incessantly crowded with\r\nexulting worshippers; and the matrons, with their children round them,\r\nin their gayest attire, and with joyous aspects and voices, offered\r\ngrateful praises to the immortal gods, as if all apprehension of evil\r\nwere over, and the war were already ended.\r\n\r\nWith the revival of confidence came also the revival of activity in\r\ntraffic and commerce, and in all the busy intercourse of daily life.\r\nA numbing load was taken off each heart and brain, and once more men\r\nbought and sold, and formed their plans fleely, as had been done before\r\nthe dire Carthaginians came into Italy. Hannibal was, certainly, still\r\nin the land; but all felt that his power to destroy was broken, and that\r\nthe crisis of the war-fever was past. The Metaurus, indeed, had not only\r\ndetermined the event of the strife between Rome and Carthage, but it\r\nhad ensured to Rome two centuries more of almost unchanged conquest.\r\nHannibal did actually, with almost superhuman skill, retain his hold on\r\nSouthern Italy for a few years longer, but the imperial city, and her\r\nallies, were no longer in danger from his arms; and, after Hannibal's\r\ndownfall, the great military republic of the ancient world met in her\r\ncareer of conquest no other worthy competitor. Byron has termed Nero's\r\nmarch \"unequalled,\" and, in the magnitude of its consequences, it is\r\nso. Viewed only as a military exploit, it remains unparalleled save by\r\nMarlborough's bold march from Flanders to the Danube, in the campaign\r\nof Blenheim, and perhaps also by the Archduke Charles's lateral march\r\nin 1796, by which he overwhelmed the French under Jourdain, and then,\r\ndriving Moreau through the Black Forest and across the Rhine, for a\r\nwhile freed Germany from her invaders.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF EVENTS BETWEEN THE BATTLE OF THE METAURUS, B.C. 207, AND\r\nARMININIUS'S VICTORY OVER THE ROMAN LEGIONS UNDER VARUS, A.D. 9.\r\n\r\nB.C. 205 to 201.

Rome makes war upon Philip, king of Macedonia. She pretends to\r\ntake the Greek cities of the Achaean league and the AEtolians under her\r\nprotection as allies. Philip is defeated by the proconsul Flaminius at\r\nCynocephalae, 198; and begs for peace. The Macedonian influence is now\r\ncompletely destroyed in Greece, and the Roman established in its stead,\r\nthough Rome nominally acknowledged the independence of the Greek cities.\r\n\r\n194. Rome makes war upon Antiochus, king of Syria. He is completely\r\ndefeated at the battle of Magnesia, 192, and is glad to accept peace on\r\nconditions which leave him dependent upon Rome.\r\n\r\n200-190. \"Thus, within the short; space of ten years, was laid the\r\nfoundation of the Roman authority in the East, and the general state\r\nof affairs entirely changed. If Rome was not yet the ruler, she was at\r\nleast the arbitress of the world from the Atlantic to the Euphrates. The\r\npower of the three principal states was so completely humbled, that\r\nthey durst not, without the permission of Rome, begin any new war; the\r\nfourth, Egypt, had already, in the year 201, placed herself under the\r\nguardianship of Rome; and the lesser powers followed of themselves:\r\nesteeming it an honour to be called the allies of Rome. With this name\r\nthe nations were lulled into security, and brought under the Roman yoke;\r\nthe new political system of Rome was founded and strengthened partly by\r\nexciting and supporting the weaker states against the stronger, however\r\nunjust the cause of the former might be, and partly by factions which\r\nshe found means to raise in every state, even the smallest.\"--(HEEREN.)\r\n\r\n172. War renewed between Macedon and Rome. Decisive defeat of Perses,\r\nthe Macedonian king, by Paulus AEmilius at Pydna, 168, Destruction of\r\nthe Macedonian monarchy.\r\n\r\n150. Rome oppresses the Carthaginians till they are driven to take up\r\narms, and the third Punic war begins, Carthage is taken and destroyed by\r\nScipio AEmilianus, 146, and the Carthaginian territory is made a Roman\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\n146. In the same year in which Carthage falls, Corinth is stormed by\r\nthe Roman army under Mummius. The Achaean league had been goaded into\r\nhostilities with Rome, by means similar to those employed against\r\nCarthage. The greater part of Southern Greece is made a Roman province,\r\nunder the name of Achaia.\r\n\r\n133. Numantium is destroyed by Scipio AEmilianus. \"The war against the\r\nSpaniards, who, of all the nations subdued by the Romans, defended their\r\nliberty with the greatest obstinacy, began in the year 200, six years\r\nafter the total expulsion of the Carthaginians from their country,\r\n206. It was exceedingly obstinate, partly from the natural state of the\r\ncountry, which was thickly populated, and where every place became a\r\nfortress; partly from the courage of the inhabitants; but at last all,\r\nowing to the peculiar policy of the Romans, who yielded to employ their\r\nallies to subdue other nations. This war continued, almost without\r\ninterruption, from the year 200 to 133, and was for the most part\r\ncarried on at the same time in Hispania Citerior, where the Celtiberi\r\nwere the most formidable adversaries, and in Hispania Ulterior, where\r\nthe Lusitani were equally powerful. Hostilities were at the highest\r\npitch in 195, under Cato, who reduced Hispania Citerior to a state\r\nof tranquillity in 185-179, when the Celtiberi were attacked in their\r\nnative territory; and 155-150, when the Romans in both provinces were so\r\noften beaten, that nothing was more dreaded by the soldiers at home than\r\nto be sent there. The extortions and perfidy of Servius Galba placed\r\nViriathus, in the year 146, at the head of his nations, the Lusitani:\r\nthe war, however, soon extended itself to Hispania Citerior, where many\r\nnations, particularly the Numantines, took up arms against Rome, 143.\r\nViriathus, sometimes victorious and sometimes defeated, was never more\r\nformidable than in the moment of defeat; because he knew how to take\r\nadvantage of his knowledge of the country and of the dispositions of his\r\ncountrymen. After his murder, caused by the treachery of Saepio, 140,\r\nLusitania was subdued; but the Numantine war became still more violent,\r\nand the Numantines compelled the consul Mancinus to a disadvantageous\r\ntreaty, 137. When Scipio, in the year 133, put an end to this war,\r\nSpain was certainly tranquil; the northern parts, however, were still\r\nunsubdued, though the Romans penetrated as far as Galatia.\"--HEEREN.\r\n\r\n134. Commencement of the revolutionary century at Rome, I.E. from the\r\ntime of the excitement produced by the attempts made by the Gracchi\r\nto reform the commonwealth, to the battle of Actium (B.C. 31), which\r\nestablished Octavianus Caesar as sole master of the Roman world.\r\nThroughout this period Rome was engaged in important foreign wars, most\r\nof which procured large accessions to her territory.\r\n\r\n118-106.

Caesar\r\ndrives Pompeius out of Italy, conquers his enemy's forces in Spain,\r\nand then passes into Greece, where Pompeius and the other aristocratic\r\nchiefs had assembled a large army. Caesar gives them a decisive\r\ndefeat at the great battle of Pharsalia. Pompeius flies for refuge\r\nto Alexandria, where he is assassinated. Caesar, who had followed him\r\nthither, is involved in a war with the Egyptians, in which he is finally\r\nvictorious. The celebrated Cleopatra is made Queen of Egypt. Caesar next\r\nmarches into Pontus, and defeats the son of Mithridates, who had taken\r\npart in the war against him. He then proceeds to the Roman province of\r\nAfrica, where some of the Pompeian chiefs had established themselves,\r\naided by Juba, a native prince. He over throws them at the battle of\r\nThapsus. He is again obliged to lead an army into Spain, where the sons\r\nof Pompeius had collected the wrecks of their father's party. He crushes\r\nthe last of his enemies at the battle of Munda. Under the title of\r\nDictator, he is the sole master of the Roman world.\r\n\r\n44. Caesar is killed in the Senate-house; the Civil wars are soon\r\nrenewed, Brutus and Cassius being at the head of the aristocratic party,\r\nand the party of Caesar being led by Mark Antony and Octavianus Caesar,\r\nafterwards Augustus.\r\n\r\n42. Defeat and death of Brutus and Cassius at Philippi. Dissensions soon\r\nbreak out between Octavianus Caesar and Antony.\r\n\r\n31. Antony is completely defeated by Octavianus Caesar at Actium.\r\nHe flies to Egypt with Cleopatra. Octavianus pursues him. Antony\r\nand Cleopatra kill themselves. Egypt becomes a Roman province, and\r\nOctavianus Caesar is left undisputed master of Rome, and all that is\r\nRome's. The state of the Roman world at this time is best described\r\nin two lines of Tacitus:--\"Postquam bellatum apud Actium, atque OMNEM\r\nPOTESTATEM AD UNUM CONFERRI PACIS INTERFUIT.\" (Hist. lib. i. s. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe 44th year of the reign of Augustus, and the 1st year of the 195th\r\nOlympiad, is commonly assigned as the date of THE NATIVITY OF OUR LORD.\r\nThere is much of the beauty of holiness in the remarks with which the\r\nAmerican historian, Eliot, closes his survey of the conquering career\r\nand civil downfall of the Roman Commonwealth:--\r\n\r\n\"So far as humility amongst men was necessary for the preparation of\r\na truer freedom than could ever be known under heathenism, the part\r\nof Rome, however dreadful was yet sublime. It was not to unite, to\r\ndiscipline, or to fortify humanity, but to enervate, to loosen, and\r\nto scatter its forces, that the people whose history we have read were\r\nallowed to conquer the earth, and were then themselves reduced to deep\r\nsubmission. Every good labour of theirs that failed was, by reason\r\nof what we esteem its failure, a step gained nearer to the end of the\r\nwell-nigh universal evil that prevailed; while every bad achievement\r\nthat may seem to us to have succeeded, temporarily or lastingly, with\r\nthem was equally, by reason of its success, a progress towards the good\r\nof which the coming would have been longed and prayed for, could it have\r\nbeen comprehended. Alike in the virtues and in the vices of antiquity,\r\nwe may read the progress towards its humiliation. [\"The Christian\r\nrevelation,\" says Leland, in his truly admirable work on the subject\r\n(vol. i. p. 488), \"was made to the world at a time when it was most\r\nwanted; when the darkness and corruption of mankind were arrived at the\r\nheight.... if it had been published much sooner, and before there had\r\nbeen a full trial made of what was to be expected from human wisdom and\r\nphilosophy, the great need men stood in of such an extraordinary divine\r\ndispensation would not have been so apparent.\"] Yet, on the other hand,\r\nit must not seem, at the last, that the disposition of the Romans or\r\nof mankind to submission was secured solely through the errors, and the\r\napparently ineffectual toils which we have traced back to these times of\r\nold. Desires too true to have been wasted, and strivings too humane to\r\nhave been unproductive, though all were overshadowed by passing wrongs,\r\nstill gleam as if in anticipation or in preparation of the advancing\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"At length, when it had been proved by ages of conflict and loss, that\r\nno lasting joy and no abiding truth could be procured through the power,\r\nthe freedom, or the faith of mankind, the angels sang their song in\r\nwhich the glory of God and the good-will of men were together blended.\r\nThe universe was wrapped In momentary tranquillity, and 'peaceful was\r\nthe night' above the manger at Bethlehem. We may believe, that when\r\nthe morning came, the ignorance, the confusion, and the servitude of\r\nhumanity had left their darkest forms amongst the midnight clouds. It\r\nwas still, indeed, beyond the power of man to lay hold securely of the\r\ncharity and the regeneration that were henceforth to be his law; and the\r\nindefinable terrors of the future, whether seen from the West or from\r\nthe East, were not at once to be dispelled. But before the death of the\r\nEmperor Augustus, in the midst of his fallen subjects, the business of\r\nTHE FATHER had already been begun in the Temple at Jerusalem; and near\r\nby, THE SON was increasing in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with\r\nGod and man.\" [Eliot's \"Liberty of Rome,\" vol. ii. p. 521.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. -- VICTORY OF ARMINIUS OVER THE ROMAN LEGIONS UNDER VARUS,\r\nA.D. 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Hac clade factum, ut Imperium quod in littore oceani non\r\n   steterat, in ripa Rheni fluminis staret.\"--FLORUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a truly illustrious Frenchman, whose reverses as a minister can never\r\nobscure his achievements in the world of letters, we are indebted for\r\nthe most profound and most eloquent estimate that we possess of the\r\nimportance of the Germanic element in European civilization, and of the\r\nextent to which the human race is indebted to those brave warriors,\r\nwho long were the unconquered antagonists, and finally became the\r\nconquerors, of Imperial Rome.\r\n\r\nTwenty-three eventful years have passed away since M. Guizot delivered\r\nfrom the chair of modern history at Paris his course of lectures on\r\nthe History of Civilization in Europe. During those years the spirit\r\nof earnest inquiry into the germs and early developments of existing\r\ninstitutions has become more and more active and universal; and the\r\nmerited celebrity of M. Guizot's work has proportionally increased. Its\r\nadmirable analysis of the complex political and social organizations of\r\nwhich the modern civilized world is made up, must have led thousands to\r\ntrace with keener interest the great crises of times past, by which the\r\ncharacteristics of the present were determined. The narrative of one of\r\nthese great crises, of the epoch A.D. 9, when Germany took up arms\r\nfor her independence against Roman invasion, has for us this special\r\nattraction--that it forms part of our own national history. Had Arminius\r\nbeen supine or unsuccessful, our Germanic ancestors would have been\r\nenslaved or exterminated in their original seats along the Eyder and the\r\nElbe; this island would never have borne the name of England, and \"we,\r\nthis great English nation, whose race and language are now over-running\r\nthe earth, from one end of it to the other,\" [Arnold's Lectures on\r\nModern History.] would have been utterly cut off from existence.\r\n\r\nArnold may, indeed, go too far in holding that we are wholly unconnected\r\nin race with the Romans and Britons who inhabited this country before\r\nthe coming over of the Saxons; that, \"nationally speaking, the history\r\nof Caesar's invasion has no more to do with us than the natural history\r\nof the animals which then inhabited our forests.\" There seems\r\nample evidence to prove that the Romanized Celts, whom our Teutonic\r\nforefathers found here, influenced materially the character of our\r\nnation. But the main stream of our people was and is Germanic. Our\r\nlanguage alone decisively proves this. Arminius is far more truly one\r\nof our national heroes than Caractacus: and it was our own primeval\r\nfatherland that the brave German rescued, when he slaughtered the Roman\r\nlegions eighteen centuries ago in the marshy glens between the Lippe and\r\nthe Ems. [See post, remarks on the relationship between the Cherusci and\r\nthe English.]\r\n\r\nDark and disheartening, even to heroic spirits, must have seemed the\r\nprospects of Germany when Arminius planned the general rising of his\r\ncountrymen against Rome. Half the land was occupied by Roman garrisons;\r\nand, what was worse, many of the Germans seemed patiently acquiescent\r\nin their state of bondage. The braver portion, whose patriotism could\r\nbe relied on, was ill-armed and undisciplined; while the enemy's troops\r\nconsisted of veterans in the highest state of equipment and training,\r\nfamiliarized with victory, and commanded by officers of proved skill and\r\nvalour. The resources of Rome seemed boundless; her tenacity of purpose\r\nwas believed to be invincible. There was no hope of foreign sympathy or\r\naid; for \"the self-governing powers that had filled the old world,\r\nhad bent one after another before the rising power of Rome, and had\r\nvanished. The earth seemed left void of independent nations.\" [Ranke.]\r\n\r\nThe (German) chieftain knew well the gigantic power of the oppressor.\r\nArminius was no rude savage, fighting out of mere animal instinct, or in\r\nignorance of the might of his adversary. He was familiar with the Roman\r\nlanguage and civilization; he had served in the Roman armies; he had\r\nbeen admitted to the Roman citizenship, and raised to the dignity of\r\nthe equestrian order. It was part of the subtle policy of Rome to confer\r\nrank and privileges on the youth of the leading families in the nations\r\nwhich she wished to enslave. Among other young German chieftains,\r\nArminius and his brother, who were the heads of the noblest house in the\r\ntribe of the Cherusci, had been selected as fit objects for the exercise\r\nof this insidious system. Roman refinements and dignities succeeded in\r\ndenationalizing the brother, who assumed the Roman name of Flavius, and\r\nadhered to Rome throughout all her wars against his country. Arminius\r\nremained unbought by honours or wealth, uncorrupted by refinement or\r\nluxury. He aspired to and obtained from Roman enmity a higher title than\r\never could have been given him by Roman favour. It is in the page of\r\nRome's greatest historian, that his name has come down to us with the\r\nproud addition of \"Liberator haud dubie Germaniae.\" [Tacitus, Annals,\r\nii. 88.]\r\n\r\nOften must the young chieftain, while meditating the exploit which has\r\nthus immortalised him, have anxiously revolved in his mind the fate\r\nof the many great men who had been crushed in the attempt which he was\r\nabout to renew,--the attempt to stay the chariot-wheels of triumphant\r\nRome. Could he hope to succeed where Hannibal and Mithridates had\r\nperished? What had been the doom of Viriathus? and what warning against\r\nvain valour was written on the desolate site where Numantia once had\r\nfourished? Nor was a caution wanting in scenes nearer home and in\r\nmore recent times. The Gauls had fruitlessly struggled for eight years\r\nagainst Caesar; and the valiant Vercingetorix, who in the last year of\r\nthe war had roused all his countrymen to insurrection, who had cut off\r\nRoman detachments, and brought Caesar himself to the extreme of peril at\r\nAlesia--he, too, had finally succumbed, had been led captive in Caesar's\r\ntriumph, and had then been butchered in cold blood in a Roman dungeon.\r\n\r\nIt was true that Rome was no longer the great military republic which\r\nfor so many ages had shattered the kingdoms of the world. Her system\r\nof government was changed; and, after a century of revolution and civil\r\nwar, she had placed herself under the despotism of a single ruler. But\r\nthe discipline of her troops was yet unimpaired, and her warlike spirit\r\nseemed unabated. The first wars of the empire had been signalised by\r\nconquests as valuable as any gained by the republic in a corresponding\r\nperiod. It is a great fallacy, though apparently sanctioned by great\r\nauthorities, to suppose that the foreign policy pursued by Augustus\r\nwas pacific. He certainly recommended such a policy to his successors,\r\neither from timidity, or from jealousy of their fame outshining his\r\nown; [\"Incertum metu an per invidiam.\"--Tac. Ann. i. 11] but he himself,\r\nuntil Arminius broke his spirit, had followed a very different course.\r\nBesides his Spanish wars, his generals, in a series of principally\r\naggressive campaigns, had extended the Roman frontier from the Alps\r\nto the Danube; and had reduced into subjection the large and important\r\ncountries that now form the territories of all Austria south of\r\nthat river, and of East Switzerland, Lower Wirtemberg, Bavaria, the\r\nValteline, and the Tyrol. While the progress of the Roman arms thus\r\npressed the Germans from the south, still more formidable inroads had\r\nbeen made by the Imperial legions in the west. Roman armies, moving from\r\nthe province of Gaul, established a chain of fortresses along the right\r\nas well as the left bank of the Rhine, and, in a series of victorious\r\ncampaigns, advanced their eagles as far as the Elbe; which now seemed\r\nadded to the list of vassal rivers, to the Nile, the Rhine, the Rhone,\r\nthe Danube, the Tagus, the Seine, and many more, that acknowledged the\r\nsupremacy of the Tiber. Roman fleets also, sailing from the harbours of\r\nGaul along the German coasts, and up the estuaries, co-operated with the\r\nland-forces of the empire; and seemed to display, even more decisively\r\nthan her armies, her overwhelming superiority over the rude Germanic\r\ntribes. Throughout the territory thus invaded, the Romans had, with\r\ntheir usual military skill, established chains of fortified posts; and a\r\npowerful army of occupation was kept on foot, ready to move instantly on\r\nany spot where a popular outbreak might be attempted.\r\n\r\nVast however, and admirably organized as the fabric of Roman power\r\nappeared on the frontiers and in the provinces, there was rottenness at\r\nthe core. In Rome's unceasing hostilities with foreign foes, and, still\r\nmore, in her long series of desolating civil wars, the free middle\r\nclasses of Italy had almost wholly disappeared. Above the position which\r\nthey had occupied, an oligarchy of wealth had reared itself: beneath\r\nthat position a degraded mass of poverty and misery was fermenting.\r\nSlaves, the chance sweepings of every conquered country, shoals of\r\nAfricans, Sardinians, Asiatics, Illyrians, and others, made up the bulk\r\nof the population of the Italian peninsula. The foulest profligacy of\r\nmanners was general in all ranks. In universal weariness of revolution\r\nand civil war, and in consciousness of being too debased for\r\nself-government, the nation had submitted itself to the absolute\r\nauthority of Augustus. Adulation was now the chief function the senate:\r\nand the gifts of genius and accomplishments of art were devoted to\r\nthe elaboration of eloquently false panegyrics upon the prince and his\r\nfavourite courtiers. With bitter indignation must the German chieftain\r\nhave beheld all this, and contrasted with it the rough worth of his own\r\ncountrymen;--their bravery, their fidelity to their word, their manly\r\nindependence of spirit their love of their national free institutions,\r\nand their loathing of every pollution and meanness. Above all, he must\r\nhave thought of the domestic virtues that hallowed a German home; of the\r\nrespect there shown to the female character, and of the pure affection\r\nby which that respect was repaid. His soul must have burned within him\r\nat the contemplation of such a race yielding to these debased Italians.\r\n\r\nStill, to persuade the Germans to combine, in spite of their frequent\r\nfeuds among themselves, in one sudden outbreak against Rome; to keep the\r\nscheme concealed from the Romans until the hour for action had arrived;\r\nand then, without possessing a single walled town, without military\r\nstores, without training, to teach his insurgent countrymen to defeat\r\nveteran armies, and storm fortifications, seemed so perilous an\r\nenterprise, that probably Arminius would have receded from it, had not a\r\nstronger feeling even than patriotism urged him on. Among the Germans\r\nof high rank who had most readily submitted to the invaders, and become\r\nzealous partisans of Roman authority, was a chieftain named Segestes.\r\nHis daughter, Thusnelda, was pre-eminent among the noble maidens of\r\nGermany. Arminius had sought her hand in marriage; but Segestes, who\r\nprobably discerned the young chief's disaffection to Rome, forbade\r\nhis suit, and strove to preclude all communication between him and\r\nhis daughter. Thusnelda, however, sympathised far more with the heroic\r\nspirit of her lover, than with the time serving policy of her father. An\r\nelopement baffled the precautions of Segestes; who, disappointed in\r\nhis hope of preventing the marriage, accused Arminius, before the Roman\r\ngovernor, of having carried off his daughter, and of planning treason\r\nagainst Rome. Thus assailed, and dreading to see his bride torn from him\r\nby the officials of the foreign oppressor, Arminius delayed no longer,\r\nbut bent all his energies to organize and execute a general insurrection\r\nof the great mass of his countrymen, who hitherto had submitted in\r\nsullen inertness to the Roman dominion.\r\n\r\nA change of governors had recently taken place, which, while it\r\nmaterially favoured the ultimate success of the insurgents, served, by\r\nthe immediate aggravation of the Roman oppressions which it produced,\r\nto make the native population more universally eager to take arms.\r\nTiberius, who was afterwards emperor, had lately been recalled from\r\nthe command in Germany, and sent into Pannonia to put down a dangerous\r\nrevolt which had broken out against the Romans in that province. The\r\nGerman patriots were thus delivered from the stern supervision of one\r\nof the most auspicious of mankind, and were also relieved from having\r\nto contend against the high military talents of a veteran commander, who\r\nthoroughly understood their national character, and the nature of\r\nthe country, which he himself had principally subdued. In the room of\r\nTiberius, Augustus sent into Germany Quintilius Varus, who had lately\r\nreturned from the proconsulate of Syria. Varus was a true representative\r\nof the higher classes of the Romans; among whom a general taste for\r\nliterature, a keen susceptibility to all intellectual gratifications,\r\na minute acquaintance with the principles and practice of their own\r\nnational jurisprudence, a careful training in the schools of the\r\nrhetoricians, and a fondness for either partaking in or watching the\r\nintellectual strife of forensic oratory, had become generally diffused;\r\nwithout, however, having humanized the old Roman spirit of cruel\r\nindifference for human feelings and human sufferings, and without acting\r\nas the least check on unprincipled avarice and ambition, or on habitual\r\nand gross profligacy. Accustomed to govern the depraved and debased\r\nnatives of Syria, a country where courage in man, and virtue in woman,\r\nhad for centuries been unknown, Varus thought that he might gratify\r\nhis licentious and rapacious passions with equal impunity among the\r\nhigh-minded sons and pure-spirited daughters of Germany. When the\r\ngeneral of an army sets the example of outrages of this description, he\r\nis soon faithfully imitated by his officers, and surpassed by his\r\nstill more brutal soldiery. The Romans now habitually indulged in those\r\nviolations of the sanctity of the domestic shrine, and those insults\r\nupon honour and modesty, by which far less gallant spirits than those of\r\nour Teutonic ancestors have often been maddened into insurrection.\r\n\r\n[I cannot forbear quoting Macaulay's beautiful lines, where he describes\r\nhow similar outrages in the early times of Rome goaded the plebeians to\r\nrise against the patricians:--\r\n\r\n     \"Heap heavier still the fetters; bar closer still the grate;\r\n      Patient as sheep we yield us up unto your cruel hate.\r\n      But by the shades beneath us, and by the gods above,\r\n      Add not unto your cruel hate your still more cruel love.\r\n      *      *      *\r\n      Then leave the poor plebeian his single tie to life--\r\n      The sweet, sweet love of daughter, of sister, and of wife,\r\n      The gentle speech, the balm for all that his vext soul endures,\r\n      The kiss in which he half forgets even such a yoke as yours.\r\n      Still let the maiden's beauty swell the father's breast with\r\n      pride;\r\n      Still let the bridegroom's arms enfold an unpolluted bride.\r\n      Spare us the inexpiable wrong, the unutterable shame,\r\n      That turns the coward's heart to steel, the sluggard's blood to\r\n      flame;\r\n      Lest when our latest hope is fled ye taste of our despair,\r\n      And learn by proof in some wild hour, how much the wretched\r\n      dare.\"]\r\n\r\nArminius found among the other German chiefs many who sympathised with\r\nhim in his indignation at their country's debasement, and many whom\r\nprivate wrongs had stung yet more deeply. There was little difficulty in\r\ncollecting bold leaders for an attack on the oppressors, and little\r\nfear of the population not rising readily at those leaders' call. But\r\nto declare open war against Rome, and to encounter Varus's army in a\r\npitched battle, would have been merely rushing upon certain destruction.\r\nVarus had three legions under him, a force which, after allowing for\r\ndetachments, cannot be estimated at less than fourteen thousand Roman\r\ninfantry. He had also eight or nine hundred Roman cavalry, and at least\r\nan equal number of horse and foot sent from the allied states, or raised\r\namong those provincials who had not received the Roman franchise.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely the number, but the quality of this force that made\r\nit formidable; and however contemptible Varus might be as a general,\r\nArminius well knew how admirably the Roman armies were organized and\r\nofficered, and how perfectly the legionaries understood every manoeuvre\r\nand every duty which the varying emergencies of a stricken field might\r\nrequire. Stratagem was, therefore, indispensable; and it was necessary\r\nto blind Varus to his schemes until a favourable opportunity should\r\narrive for striking a decisive blow.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose the German confederates frequented the headquarters of\r\nVarus, which seem to have been near the centre of the modern country\r\nof Westphalia, where the Roman general conducted himself with all the\r\narrogant security of the governor of a perfectly submissive province.\r\nThere Varus gratified at once his vanity, his rhetorical taste, and his\r\navarice, by holding courts, to which he summoned the Germans for\r\nthe settlement of all their disputes, while a bar of Roman advocates\r\nattended to argue the cases before the tribunal of the Proconsul;\r\nwho did not omit the opportunity of exacting court-fees and accepting\r\nbribes. Varus trusted implicitly to the respect which the Germans\r\npretended to pay to his abilities as a judge, and to the interest which\r\nthey affected to take in the forensic eloquence of their conquerors.\r\nMeanwhile a succession of heavy rains rendered the country more\r\ndifficult for the operations of regular troops; and Arminius, seeing\r\nthat the infatuation of Varus was complete, secretly directed the tribes\r\nnear the Weser and the Ems to take up arms in open revolt against the\r\nRomans. This was represented to Varus as an occasion which required his\r\nprompt attendance at the spot; but he was kept in studied ignorance of\r\nits being part of a concerted national rising; and he still looked\r\non Arminius as his submissive vassal, whose aid he might rely on\r\nin facilitating the march of his troops against the rebels, and in\r\nextinguishing the local disturbance. He therefore set his army in\r\nmotion, and marched eastward in a line parallel to the course of the\r\nLippe. For some distance his route lay along a level plain; but on\r\narriving at the tract between the curve of the upper part of that\r\nstream and the sources of the Ems, the country assumes a very different\r\ncharacter; and here, in the territory of the modern little principality\r\nof Lippe, it was that Arminius had fixed the scene of his enterprise.\r\n\r\nA woody and hilly region intervenes between the heads of the two rivers,\r\nand forms the water-shed of their streams. This region still retains\r\nthe name (Teutoberger wald--Teutobergiensis saltus) which it bore in the\r\ndays of Arminius. The nature of the ground has probably also remained\r\nunaltered. The eastern part of it, round Detmoldt, the present capital\r\nof the principality of Lippe, is described by a modern German scholar,\r\nDr. Plate, as being \"a table-land intersected by numerous deep and\r\nnarrow valleys, which in some places form small plains, surrounded by\r\nsteep mountains and rocks, and only accessible by narrow defiles. All\r\nthe valleys are traversed by rapid streams, shallow in the dry season,\r\nbut subject to sudden swellings in autumn and winter. The vast forests\r\nwhich cover the summits and slopes of the hills consist chiefly of oak;\r\nthere is little underwood, and both men and horse would move with ease\r\nin the forests if the ground were not broken by gulleys, or rendered\r\nimpracticable by fallen trees.\" This is the district to which Varus is\r\nsupposed to have marched; and Dr. Plate adds, that \"the names of several\r\nlocalities on and near that spot seem to indicate that a great battle\r\nhad once been fought there. We find the names 'das Winnefeld' (the field\r\nof victory), 'die Knochenbahn' (the bone-lane), 'die Knochenleke' (the\r\nbone-brook), 'der Mordkessel' (the kettle of slaughter), and others.\" [I\r\nam indebted for much valuable information on this subject to my friend\r\nMr. Henry Pearson.]\r\n\r\nContrary to the usual strict principles of Roman discipline, Varus had\r\nsuffered his army to be accompanied and impeded by an immense train of\r\nbaggage-waggons, and by a rabble of camp followers; as if his troops had\r\nbeen merely changing their quarters in a friendly country. When the long\r\narray quitted the firm level ground, and began to wind its way among the\r\nwoods, the marshes, and the ravines, the difficulties of the march, even\r\nwithout the intervention of an armed foe, became fearfully apparent. In\r\nmany places the soil, sodden with rain, was impracticable for cavalry\r\nand even for infantry, until trees had been felled, and a rude causeway\r\nformed through the morass.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the engineer were familiar to all who served in the Roman\r\narmies. But the crowd and confusion of the columns embarrassed the\r\nworking parties of the soldiery, and in the midst of their toil and\r\ndisorder the word was suddenly passed through their ranks that the\r\nrear-guard was attacked by the barbarians. Varus resolved on pressing\r\nforward; but a heavy discharge of missiles from the woods on either\r\nflank taught him how serious was the peril, and he saw the best men\r\nfalling round him without the opportunity of retaliation; for his\r\nlight-armed auxiliaries, who were principally of Germanic race, now\r\nrapidly deserted, and it was impossible to deploy the legionaries on\r\nsuch broken ground for a charge against the enemy. Choosing one of the\r\nmost open and firm spots which they could force their way to, the Romans\r\nhalted for the night; and, faithful to their national discipline and\r\ntactics, formed their camp amid the harassing attacks of the rapidly\r\nthronging foes, with the elaborate toil and systematic skill, the traces\r\nof which are impressed permanently on the soil of so many European\r\ncountries, attesting the presence in the olden time of the imperial\r\neagles.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow the Romans renewed their march; the veteran officers who\r\nserved under Varus now probably directing the operations, and hoping\r\nto find the Germans drawn up to meet them; in which case they relied on\r\ntheir own superior discipline and tactics for such a victory as\r\nshould reassure the supremacy of Rome. But Arminius was far too sage a\r\ncommander to lead on his followers, with their unwieldy broadswords and\r\ninefficient defensive armour, against the Roman legionaries, fully armed\r\nwith helmet, cuirass, greaves, and shield; who were skilled to commence\r\nthe conflict with a murderous volley of heavy javelins, hurled upon the\r\nfoe when a few yards distant, and then, with their short cut-and-thrust\r\nswords, to hew their way through all opposition; preserving the utmost\r\nsteadiness and coolness, and obeying each word of command. In the midst\r\nof strife and slaughter with the same precision and alertness as if upon\r\nparade. [See Gibbon's description (vol. i, chap. 1) of the Roman legions\r\nin the time of Augustus; and see the description in Tacitus (Ann. lib.\r\ni) of the subsequent battles between Caecina and Arminius.] Arminius\r\nsuffered the Romans to march out from their camp, to form first in\r\nline for action, and then in column for marching, without the show\r\nof opposition. For some distance Varus was allowed to move on, only\r\nharassed by slight skirmishes, but struggling with difficulty through\r\nthe broken ground; the toil and distress of his men being aggravated by\r\nheavy torrents of rain, which burst upon the devoted legions as if the\r\nangry gods of Germany were pouring out the vials of their wrath upon the\r\ninvaders. After some little time their van approached a ridge of high\r\nwoody ground, which is one of the off-shoots of the great Hercynian\r\nforest, and is situate between the modern villages of Driburg and\r\nBielefeld. Arminius had caused barricades of hewn trees to be formed\r\nhere, so as to add to the natural difficulties of the passage. Fatigue\r\nand discouragement now began to betray themselves in the Roman ranks.\r\nTheir line became less steady; baggage-waggons were abandoned from\r\nthe impossibility of forcing them along; and, as this happened, many\r\nsoldiers left their ranks and crowded round the waggons to secure the\r\nmost valuable portions of their property; each was busy about his own\r\naffairs, and purposely slow in hearing the word of command from his\r\nofficers. Arminius now gave the signal for a general attack. The fierce\r\nshouts of the Germans pealed through the gloom of the forests, and in\r\nthronging multitudes they assailed the flanks of the invaders, pouring\r\nin clouds of darts on the encumbered legionaries, as they struggled up\r\nthe glens or floundered in the morasses, and watching every opportunity\r\nof charging through the intervals of the disjointed column, and so\r\ncutting off the communication between its several brigades. Arminius,\r\nwith a chosen band of personal retainers round him, cheered on his\r\ncountrymen by voice and example. He and his men aimed their weapons\r\nparticularly at the horses of the Roman cavalry. The wounded animals,\r\nslipping about in the mire and their own blood, threw their riders,\r\nand plunged among the ranks of the legions, disordering all round\r\nthem. Varus now ordered the troops to be countermarched, in the hope of\r\nreaching the nearest Roman garrison on the Lippe. [The circumstances\r\nof the early part of the battle which Arminius fought with Caecina six\r\nyears afterwards, evidently resembled those of his battle with Varus,\r\nand the result was very near being the same: I have therefore adopted\r\npart of the description which Tacitus gives (Ann. lib. i. c. 65) of the\r\nlast mentioned engagement: \"Neque tamen Arminius, quamquam libero in\r\ncursu, statim prorupit: sed ut haesere caeno fossisque impedimenta,\r\nturbati circum milites; incertus signorum ordo; utque tali in tempore\r\nsibi quisque properus, et lentae adversum imperia aures, irrumpere\r\nGermanos jubet, clamitans 'En Varus, et eodem iterum fato victae\r\nlegiones!' Simul haec, et cum delectis scindit agmen, equisque maxime\r\nvulnera ingerit; illi sanguine suo et lubrico paludum lapsantes,\r\nexcussis rectoribus, disjicere obvios, proterere jacentes.\"] But retreat\r\nnow was as impracticable as advance; and the falling back of the Romans\r\nonly augmented the courage of their assailants, and caused fiercer and\r\nmore frequent charges on the flanks of the disheartened army. The Roman\r\nofficer who commanded the cavalry, Numonius Vala, rode off with his\r\nsquadrons, in the vain hope of escaping by thus abandoning his comrades.\r\nUnable to keep together, or force their way across the woods and swamps,\r\nthe horsemen were overpowered in detail and slaughtered to the last man.\r\nThe Roman infantry still held together and resisted, but more through\r\nthe instinct of discipline and bravery than from any hope of success or\r\nescape. Varus, after being severely wounded in a charge of the Germans\r\nagainst his part of the column, committed suicide to avoid falling into\r\nthe hands of those whom he had exasperated by his oppressions. One of\r\nthe lieutenant-generals of the army fell fighting; the other surrendered\r\nto the enemy. But mercy to a fallen foe had never been a Roman virtue,\r\nand those among her legions who now laid down their arms in hope of\r\nquarter, drank deep of the cup of suffering, which Rome had held to\r\nthe lips of many a brave but unfortunate enemy. The infuriated Germans\r\nslaughtered their oppressors with deliberate ferocity; and those\r\nprisoners who were not hewn to pieces on the spot, were only preserved\r\nto perish by a more cruel death in cold blood.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the Roman army fought steadily and stubbornly, frequently\r\nrepelling the masses of the assailants, but gradually losing the\r\ncompactness of their array, and becoming weaker and weaker beneath the\r\nincessant shower of darts and the reiterated assaults of the vigorous\r\nand unencumbered Germans. At last, in a series of desperate attacks the\r\ncolumn was pierced through and through, two of the eagles captured, and\r\nthe Roman host, which on the yester morning had marched forth in such\r\npride and might, now broken up into confused fragments, either fell\r\nfighting beneath the overpowering numbers of the enemy, or perished in\r\nthe swamps and woods in unavailing efforts at flight. Few, very few,\r\never saw again the left bank of the Rhine. One body of brave veterans,\r\narraying themselves in a ring on a little mound, beat off every charge\r\nof the Germans, and prolonged their honourable resistance to the close\r\nof that dreadful day. The traces of a feeble attempt at forming a ditch\r\nand mound attested in after years the spot where the last of the Romans\r\npassed their night of suffering and despair. But on the morrow this\r\nremnant also, worn out with hunger, wounds, and toil, was charged by the\r\nvictorious Germans, and either massacred on the spot, or offered up in\r\nfearful rites at the alters of the deities of the old mythology of the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nA gorge in the mountain ridge, through which runs the modern road\r\nbetween Paderborn and Pyrmont, leads from the spot where the heat of the\r\nbattle raged, to the Extersteine, a cluster of bold and grotesque rocks\r\nof sandstone; near which is a small sheet of water, overshadowed by a\r\ngrove of aged trees. According to local tradition, this was one of the\r\nsacred groves of the ancient Germans, and it was here that the Roman\r\ncaptives were slain in sacrifice by the victorious warriors of Arminius.\r\n[\"Lucis propinquis barbarae arae, apud quas tribunos ac primorum ordinam\r\ncenturiones mactaverant.\"--TACITUS, Ann. lib. i. c. 61.]\r\n\r\nNever was victory more decisive, never was the liberation of an\r\noppressed people more instantaneous and complete. Throughout Germany the\r\nRoman garrisons were assailed and cut off; and, within a few weeks after\r\nVarus had fallen, the German soil was freed from the foot of an invader.\r\n\r\nAt Rome, the tidings of the battle was received with an agony of terror,\r\nthe descriptions of which we should deem exaggerated, did they not come\r\nfrom Roman historians themselves. These passages in the Roman writers\r\nnot only tell emphatically how great was the awe which the Romans felt\r\nof the prowess of the Germans, if their various tribes could be brought\r\nto reunite for a common purpose, but also they reveal bow weakened and\r\ndebased the population of Italy had become. [It is clear that the Romans\r\nfollowed the policy of fomenting dissension and wars of the Germans\r\namong themselves. See the thirty-third section of the \"Germania\" of\r\nTacitus, where he mentions the destruction of the Bructeri by the\r\nneighbouring tribes: \"Favore quodam erga nos deorum: nam ne spectaculo\r\nquidem proelii invidere: super LX. millia non armis telisque Romanis,\r\nsed, quod magnificentius est, oblectationi oculisque ceciderunt. Maneat\r\nquaeso, duretque gentibus, si non amor nostri at certe odium sui quando\r\nurgentibus imperii fatis, nihil jam praestare fortuna majus potes quam\r\nhostiam discordiam.\"] Dion Cassius says: [Lib. lvi. sec. 23.] \"Then\r\nAugustus, when he heard the calamity of Varus, rent his garments, and\r\nwas in great affliction for the troops he had lost, and for terror\r\nrespecting the Germans and the Gauls. And his chief alarm was, that he\r\nexpected them to push on against Italy and Rome: and there remained no\r\nRoman youth fit for military duty, that were worth speaking of, and the\r\nallied populations that were at all serviceable had been wasted away.\r\nYet he prepared for the emergency as well as his means allowed; and when\r\nnone of the citizens of military age were willing to enlist he made them\r\ncast lots, and punished by confiscation of goods and disfranchisement\r\nevery fifth man among those under thirty-five, and every tenth man of\r\nthose above that age. At last, when he found that not even thus; could\r\nhe make many come forward, he put some of them to death. So he made\r\na conscription of discharged veterans and emancipated slaves, and\r\ncollecting as large a force as he could, sent it, under Tiberius, with\r\nall speed into Germany.\"\r\n\r\nDion mentions, also, a number of terrific portents that were believed to\r\nhave occurred at the time; and the narration of which is not immaterial,\r\nas it shows the state of the public mind, when such things were so\r\nbelieved in, and so interpreted. The summits of the Alps were said to\r\nhave fallen, and three columns of fire to have blazed up from them. In\r\nthe Campus Martius, the temple of the War-God, from whom the founder of\r\nRome had sprung, was struck by a thunderbolt. The nightly heavens glowed\r\nseveral times, as if on fire. Many comets blazed forth together; and\r\nfiery meteors shaped like spears, had shot from the northern quarter of\r\nthe sky, down into the Roman camps. It was said, too, that a statue of\r\nVictory, which had stood at a place on the frontier, pointing the way\r\ntowards Germany, had of its own accord turned round, and now pointed\r\nto Italy. These and other prodigies were believed by the multitude to\r\naccompany the slaughter of Varus's legions, and to manifest the anger of\r\nthe gods against Rome, Augustus himself was not free from superstition;\r\nbut on this occasion no supernatural terrors were needed to increase the\r\nalarm and grief that he felt; and which made him, even for months after\r\nthe news of the battle had arrived, often beat his head against the\r\nwall, and exclaim, \"Quintilius Varus, give me back my legions!\" We learn\r\nthis from his biographer, Suetonius; and, indeed, every ancient writer\r\nwho alludes to the overthrow of Varus, attests the importance of the\r\nblow against the Roman power, and the bitterness with which it was felt.\r\n[Florus expresses its effect most pithily: \"Hac clade factum est ut\r\nimperium quod in litore oceani non steterat, in ripa Rheni fluminis\r\nstaret\" (iv. 12).]\r\n\r\nThe Germans did not pursue their victory beyond their own territory.\r\nBut that victory secured at once and for ever the independence of the\r\nTeutonic race. Rome sent, indeed, her legions again into Germany, to\r\nparade a temporary superiority; but all hopes of permanent conquest were\r\nabandoned by Augustus and his successors.\r\n\r\nThe blow which Arminius had struck never was forgotten, Roman fear\r\ndisguised itself under the specious title of moderation; and the Rhine\r\nbecame the acknowledged boundary of the two nations until the fifth\r\ncentury of our era, when the Germans became the assailants, and carved\r\nwith their conquering swords the provinces of Imperial Rome into the\r\nkingdoms of modern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMINIUS.\r\n\r\nI have said above that the great Cheruscan is more truly one of our\r\nnational heroes than Caractacus is. It may be added that an Englishman\r\nis entitled to claim a closer degree of relationship with Arminius\r\nthan can be claimed by any German of modern Germany. The proof of this\r\ndepends on the proof of four facts: first, that the Cherusci were\r\nOld Saxons, or Saxons of the interior of Germany; secondly, that the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, or Saxons of the coast of Germany, were more closely akin\r\nthan other German tribes were to the Cheruscan Saxons; thirdly, that the\r\nOld Saxons were almost exterminated by Charlemagne; fourthly, that\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons are our immediate ancestors. The last of these may be\r\nassumed as an axiom in English history. The proofs of the other three\r\nare partly philological, and partly historical. I have not space to\r\ngo into them here, but they will be found in the early chapters of the\r\ngreat work of Dr. Robert Gordon Latham on the \"English Language;\" and\r\nin the notes to his edition of the \"Germania of Tacitus.\" It may be,\r\nhowever, here remarked that the present Saxons of Germany are of the\r\nHigh Germanic division of the German race, whereas both the Anglo-Saxon\r\nand Old Saxon were of the Low Germanic.\r\n\r\nBeing thus the nearest heirs of the glory of Arminius, we may fairly\r\ndevote more attention to his career than, in such a work as the present,\r\ncould be allowed to any individual leader, and it is interesting to\r\ntrace how far his fame survived during the middle ages, both among the\r\nGermans of the Continent and among ourselves.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the jealousy with which Maraboduus, the king of\r\nthe Suevi and Marcomanni, regarded Arminius, and which ultimately broke\r\nout into open hostilities between those German tribes and the Cherusci,\r\nprevented Arminius from leading the confederate Germans to attack Italy\r\nafter his first victory. Perhaps he may have had the rare moderation\r\nof being content with the liberation of his country, without seeking to\r\nretaliate on her former oppressors. When Tiberius marched into Germany\r\nin the year 10, Arminius was too cautious to attack him on ground\r\nfavourable to the legions, and Tiberius was too skilful, to entangle his\r\ntroops in difficult parts of the country. His march and counter-march\r\nwere as unresisted as they were unproductive. A few years later, when\r\na dangerous revolt of the Roman legions near the frontier caused\r\ntheir generals to find them active employment by leading them into the\r\ninterior of Germany, we find Arminius again energetic in his country's\r\ndefence. The old quarrel between him and his father-in-law, Segestes,\r\nhad broken out afresh. Segestes now called in the aid of the Roman\r\ngeneral, Germanicus, to whom he surrendered himself; and by his\r\ncontrivance his daughter Thusnelda, the wife of Arminius, also came into\r\nthe hands of the Romans, being far advanced in pregnancy. She showed, as\r\nTacitus relates, [Ann. i. 57.] more of the spirit of her husband than\r\nof her father, a spirit that could not be subdued into tears or\r\nsupplications. She was sent to Ravenna, and there gave birth to a son,\r\nwhose life we find, from an allusion in Tacitus, to have been eventful\r\nand unhappy; but the part of the great historian's work which narrated\r\nhis fate has perished, and we only know from another quarter that\r\nthe son of Arminius was, at the age of four years, led captive in a\r\ntriumphal pageant along the streets of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe high spirit of Arminius was goaded almost into frenzy by these\r\nbereavements. The fate of his wife, thus torn from him, and of his\r\nbabe doomed to bondage even before its birth, inflamed the eloquent\r\ninvectives with which he roused his countrymen against the home\r\ntraitors, and against their invaders, who thus made war upon women and\r\nchildren. Germanicus had marched his army to the place where Varus had\r\nperished, and had there paid funeral honours to the ghastly relics\r\nof his predecessor's legions that he found heaped around him. [In\r\nthe Museum of Rhenish antiquities at Bonn there is a Roman sepulchral\r\nmonument, the inscription on which records that it was erected to the\r\nmemory of M. Coelius, who fell \"BELLO VARIANO.\"] Arminius lured him to\r\nadvance a little further into the country, and then assailed him, and\r\nfought a battle, which, by the Roman accounts, was a drawn one. The\r\neffect of it was to make Germanicus resolve on retreating to the Rhine.\r\nHe himself, with part of his troops, embarked in some vessels on the\r\nEms, and returned by that river, and then by sea; but part of his forces\r\nwere entrusted to a Roman general, named Caecina, to lead them back by\r\nland to the Rhine. Arminius followed this division on its march, and\r\nfought several battles with it, in which he inflicted heavy loss on\r\nthe Romans, captured the greater part of their baggage, and would have\r\ndestroyed them completely, had not his skilful system of operations been\r\nfinally thwarted by the haste of Inguiomerus, a confederate German chief\r\nwho insisted on assaulting the Romans in their camp, instead of waiting\r\ntill they were entangled in the difficulties of the country, and\r\nassailing their columns on the march.\r\n\r\nIn the following year the Romans were inactive; but in the year\r\nafterwards Germanicus led a fresh invasion. He placed his army on\r\nship-board, and sailed to the mouth of the Ems, where he disembarked,\r\nand marched to the Weser, where he encamped, probably in the\r\nneighbourhood of Minden. Arminius had collected his army on the other\r\nside of the river; and a scene occurred, which is powerfully told by\r\nTacitus, and which is the subject of a beautiful poem by Praed. It has\r\nbeen already mentioned that the brother of Arminius, like himself, had\r\nbeen trained up, while young, to serve in the Roman armies; but, unlike\r\nArminius, he not only refused to quit the Roman service for that of his\r\ncountry, but fought against his country with the legions of Germanicus.\r\nHe had assumed the Roman name of Flavius, and had gained considerable\r\ndistinction in the Roman service, in which he had lost an eye from a\r\nwound in battle. When the Roman outposts approached the river Weser,\r\nArminius called out to them from the opposite bank, and expressed a wish\r\nto see his brother. Flavius stepped forward, and Arminius ordered\r\nhis own followers to retire, and requested that the archers should\r\nbe removed from the Roman bank of the river. This was done: and the\r\nbrothers, who apparently had not seen each other for some years, began\r\na conversation from the opposite sides of the stream, in which Arminius\r\nquestioned his brother respecting the loss of his eye, and what battle\r\nit had been lost in, and what reward he had received for his wound.\r\nFlavius told him how the eye was destroyed, and mentioned the increased\r\npay that he had on account of its loss, and showed the collar and other\r\nmilitary decorations that had been given him. Arminius mocked at these\r\nas badges of slavery; and then each began to try to win the other\r\nover; Flavius boasting the power of Rome, and her generosity to the\r\nsubmissive; Arminius appealing to him in the name of their country's\r\ngods, of the mother that had borne them, and by the holy names of\r\nfatherland and freedom, not to prefer being the betrayer to being\r\nthe champion of his country. They soon proceeded to mutual taunts and\r\nmenaces, and Flavius called aloud for his horse and his arms, that he\r\nmight dash across the river and attack his brother; nor would he have\r\nbeen checked from doing so, had not the Roman general, Stertinius, run\r\nup to him, and forcibly detained him. Arminius stood on the other bank,\r\nthreatening the renegade, and defying him to battle.\r\n\r\nI shall not be thought to need apology for quoting here the stanzas in\r\nwhich Praed has described this scene--a scene among the most affecting,\r\nas well as the most striking, that history supplies. It makes us reflect\r\non the desolate position of Arminius, with his wife and child captives\r\nin the enemy's hands, and with his brother a renegade in arms against\r\nhim. The great liberator of our German race stood there, with every\r\nsource of human happiness denied him, except the consciousness of doing\r\nhis duty to his country.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Back, back!  he fears not foaming flood\r\n       Who fears not steel-clad line:--\r\n      No warrior thou of German blood,\r\n       No brother thou of mine.\r\n      Go, earn Rome's chain to load thy neck,\r\n       Her gems to deck thy hilt;\r\n      And blazon honour's hapless wreck\r\n       With all the gauds of guilt.\r\n\r\n     \"But wouldst thou have ME share the prey?\r\n       By all that I have done,--\r\n      The Varian bones that day by day\r\n       Lie whitening in the sun,\r\n      The legion's trampled panoply,\r\n       The eagle's shattered wing,--\r\n      I would not be for earth or sky\r\n       So scorn'd and mean a thing.\r\n\r\n     \"Ho, call me here the wizard, boy,\r\n       Of dark and subtle skill,\r\n      To agonise but not destroy,\r\n       To curse, but not to kill.\r\n      When swords are out, and shriek and shout,\r\n       Leave little room for prayer,\r\n      No fetter on man's arm or heart\r\n       Hangs half so heavy there.\r\n\r\n     \"I curse him by the gifts the land\r\n       Hath won from him and Rome--\r\n      The riving axe, the wasting brand,\r\n       Rent forest, blazing home.\r\n      I curse him by our country's gods,\r\n       The terrible, the dark,\r\n      The breakers of the Roman rods,\r\n       The smiters of the bark.\r\n\r\n     \"Oh misery, that such a ban\r\n       On such a brow should be!\r\n      Why comes he not in battle's van\r\n       His country's chief to be?--\r\n      To stand a comrade by my side,\r\n       The sharer of my fame,\r\n      And worthy of a brother's pride\r\n       And of a brother's name?\r\n\r\n     \"But it is past!--where heroes press\r\n       And cowards bend the knee\r\n      Arminius is not brotherless;\r\n       His brethren are the free.\r\n      They come around:  one hour, and light\r\n       Will fade from turf and tide,\r\n      Then onward, onward to the fight\r\n       With darkness for our guide.\r\n\r\n     \"To-night, to-night, when we shall meet\r\n       In combat face to face,\r\n      Then only would Arminius greet\r\n       The renegade's embrace.\r\n      The canker of Rome's guilt shall be\r\n       Upon his dying name;\r\n      And as he lived in slavery,\r\n       So shall he fall in shame.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day after the Romans had reached the Weser, Germanicus led his\r\narmy across that river, and a partial encounter took place, in which\r\nArminius was successful. But on the succeeding day a general action was\r\nfought, in which Arminius was severely wounded, and the German infantry\r\nrouted with heavy loss. The horsemen of the two armies encountered\r\nwithout either party gaining the advantage. But the Roman army remained\r\nmaster of the ground, and claimed a complete victory. Germanicus erected\r\na trophy in the field, with a vaunting inscription, that the nations\r\nbetween the Rhine and the Elbe had been thoroughly conquered by his\r\narmy. But that army speedily made a final retreat to the left bank of\r\nthe Rhine; nor was the effect of their campaign more durable than their\r\ntrophy. The sarcasm with which Tacitus speaks of certain other\r\ntriumphs of Roman generals over Germans, may apply to the pageant which\r\nGermanicus celebrated on his return to Rome from his command of the\r\nRoman army of the Rhine. The Germans were \"TRIUMPHATI POTIUS QUAM\r\nVICTI.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Romans had abandoned their attempts on Germany, we find\r\nArminius engaged in hostilities with Maroboduus, the king of the Suevi\r\nand Marcomanni who was endeavouring to bring the other German tribes\r\ninto a state of dependency on him. Arminius was at the head of the\r\nGermans who took up arms against this home invader of their liberties.\r\nAfter some minor engagements, a pitched battle was fought between the\r\ntwo confederacies, A.D. 16, in which the loss on each side was equal;\r\nbut Maroboduus confessed the ascendency of his antagonist by avoiding\r\na renewal of the engagement, and by imploring the intervention of the\r\nRomans in his defence. The younger Drusus then commanded the Roman\r\nlegions in the province of Illyricum, and by his mediation a peace was\r\nconcluded between Arminius and Maroboduus, by the terms of which it\r\nis evident that the latter must have renounced his ambitious schemes\r\nagainst the freedom of the other German tribes.\r\n\r\nArminius did not long survive this second war of independence, which\r\nhe successfully waged for his country. He was assassinated in the\r\nthirty-seventh year of his age, by some of his own kinsmen, who\r\nconspired against him. Tacitus says that this happened while he was\r\nengaged in a civil war, which had been caused by his attempts to make\r\nhimself king over his countrymen. It is far more probable (as one of the\r\nbest biographers of Arminius has observed) that Tacitus misunderstood an\r\nattempt of Arminius to extend his influence as elective war-chieftain\r\nof the Cherusci, and other tribes, for an attempt to obtain the royal\r\ndignity. [Dr. Plate, in Biographical Dictionary commenced by the Society\r\nfor the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.] When we remember that his\r\nfather-in-law and his brother were renegades, we can well understand\r\nthat a party among his kinsmen may have been bitterly hostile to him,\r\nand have opposed his authority with the tribe by open violence, and when\r\nthat seemed ineffectual, by secret assassination.\r\n\r\nArminius left a name, which the historians of the nation against which\r\nhe combated so long and so gloriously have delighted to honour. It is\r\nfrom the most indisputable source, from the lips of enemies, that\r\nwe know his exploits. [See Tacitus, Ann. lib. ii. sec. 88; Velleius\r\nPaterculus, lib. ii. sec. 118.] His country men made history, but did\r\nnot write it. But his memory lived among them in the lays of their\r\nbards, who recorded\r\n\r\n\"The deeds he did, the fields he won, The freedom he restored.\"\r\n\r\nTacitus, many years after the death of Arminius, says of him, \"Canitur\r\nadhuc barbaras apud gentes.\" As time passed on, the gratitude of ancient\r\nGermany to her great deliverer grew into adoration, and divine honours\r\nwere paid for centuries to Arminius by every tribe of the Low Germanic\r\ndivision of the Teutonic races. The Irmin-sul, or the column of Herman,\r\nnear Eresburg, the modern Stadtberg, was the chosen object of worship to\r\nthe descendants of the Cherusci, the Old Saxons, and in defence of which\r\nthey fought most desperately against Charlemagne and his christianized\r\nFranks. \"Irmin, in the cloudy Olympus of Teutonic belief, appears as a\r\nking and a warrior; and the pillar, the 'Irmin-sul,' bearing the statue,\r\nand considered as the symbol of the deity, was the Palladium of the\r\nSaxon nation, until the temple of Eresburg was destroyed by Charlemagne,\r\nand the column itself transferred to the monastery of Corbey, where,\r\nperhaps, a portion of the rude rock idol yet remains, covered by the\r\nornaments of the Gothic era.\" [Palgrave on the English Commonwealth,\r\nvol. ii. p. 140.]\r\n\r\nTraces of the worship of Arminius are to be found among our Anglo-Saxon\r\nancestors, after their settlement in this island. One of the four great\r\nhighways was held to be under the protection of the deity, and was\r\ncalled the \"Irmin-street.\" The name Arminius is, of course, the mere\r\nLatinized form of \"Herman,\" the name by which the hero and the deity\r\nwere known by every man of Low German blood, on either side of the\r\nGerman Sea. It means, etymologically, the \"War-man,\" the \"man of hosts.\"\r\nNo other explanation of the worship of the \"Irmin-sul,\" and of the name\r\nof the \"Irmin-street,\" is so satisfactory as that which connects them\r\nwith the deified Arminius. We know for certain of the existence of other\r\ncolumns of an analogous character. Thus, there was the Roland-seule\r\nin North Germany; there was a Thor-seule in Sweden, and (what is\r\nmore important) there was an Athelstan-seule in Saxon England. [See\r\nLappenburg's Anglo-Saxons, p. 378. For nearly all the philological and\r\nethnographical facts respecting Arminius, I am indebted to Dr. R. G.\r\nLatham.]\r\n\r\nThere is at the present moment a song respecting the Irmin-sul current\r\nin the bishopric of Minden, one version of which might seem only to\r\nrefer to Charlemagne having pulled down the Irmin-sul:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Herman, sla dermen, Sla pipen, sla trummen,\r\n    De Kaiser will kummen,\r\n    Met hamer un stangen,\r\n    Will Herman uphangen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there is another version, which probably is the oldest, and which\r\nclearly refers to the great Arminius:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Un Herman slaug dermen; Slaug pipen, slaug trummen;\r\n    De fursten sind kammen,\r\n    Met all eren-mannen\r\n    Hebt VARUS uphangen.\"\r\n   [See Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, p. 329.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout ten centuries and a half after the demolition of the Irmin-sul,\r\nand nearly eighteen after the death of Arminius, the modern Germans\r\nconceived the idea of rendering tardy homage to their great hero; and,\r\naccordingly some eight or ten years ago, a general subscription was\r\norganized in Germany, for the purpose of erecting on the Osning--a\r\nconical mountain, which forms the highest summit of the Teutoberger\r\nWald, and is eighteen hundred feet above the level of the sea--a\r\ncolossal bronze statue of Arminius. The statue was designed by Bandel.\r\nThe hero was to stand uplifting a sword in his right hand, and looking\r\ntowards the Rhine. The height of the statue was to be eighty feet from\r\nthe base to the point of the sword, and was to stand on a circular\r\nGothic temple, ninety feet high, and supported by oak trees as columns.\r\nThe mountain, where it was to be erected, is wild and stern, and\r\noverlooks the scene of the battle. It was calculated that the statue\r\nwould be clearly visible at a distance of sixty miles. The temple is\r\nnearly finished, and the statue itself has been cast at the copper works\r\nat Lemgo. But there, through want of funds to set it up, it has lain for\r\nsome years, in disjointed fragments, exposed to the mutilating homage\r\nof relic-seeking travellers. The idea of honouring a hero who belongs to\r\nALL Germany, is not one which the present rulers of that divided country\r\nhave any wish to encourage; and the statue may long continue to lie\r\nthere, and present too true a type of the condition of Germany herself.\r\n[On the subject of this statue I must repeat an acknowledgment of my\r\nobligations to my friend Mr. Henry Pearson.]\r\n\r\nSurely this is an occasion in which Englishmen might well prove, by acts\r\nas well as words, that we also rank Arminius among our heroes.\r\n\r\nI have quoted the noble stanzas of one of our modern English poets on\r\nArminius, and I will conclude this memoir with one of the odes of the\r\ngreat poet of modern Germany, Klopstock, on the victory to which we owe\r\nour freedom, and Arminius mainly owes his fame. Klopstock calls it\r\nthe \"Battle of Winfield.\" The epithet of \"Sister of Cannae\" shows that\r\nKlopstock followed some chronologers, according to whom, Varus was\r\ndefeated on the anniversary of the day on which Paulus and Varro were\r\ndefeated by Hannibal.\r\n\r\nSONG OF TRIUMPH AFTER THE VICTORY OF HERRMAN, THE DELIVERER OF GERMANY\r\nFROM THE ROMANS.\r\n\r\nFROM KLOPSTOCK'S \"HERRMAN UND DIE FURSTEN.\" Supposed to be sung by a\r\nChorus of Bards.\r\n\r\nA CHORUS.\r\n\r\n      Sister of Cannae!

The long rows of poplars, through which the river Marne winds\r\nits way, and a few thinly-scattered villages, are almost the only\r\nobjects that vary the monotonous aspect of the greater part of this\r\nregion. But about five miles from Chalons, near the little hamlets of\r\nChaps and Cuperly, the ground is indented and heaped up in ranges of\r\ngrassy mounds and trenches, which attest the work of man's hand in ages\r\npast; and which, to the practised eye, demonstrate that this quiet spot\r\nhas once been the fortified position of a huge military host.\r\n\r\nLocal tradition gives to these ancient earthworks the name of Attila's\r\nCamp. Nor is there any reason to question the correctness of the title,\r\nor to doubt that behind these very ramparts it was that, 1400 years ago,\r\nthe most powerful heathen king that ever ruled in Europe mustered the\r\nremnants of his vast army, which had striven on these plains against\r\nthe Christian soldiery of Thoulouse and Rome. Here it was that Attila\r\nprepared to resist to the death his victors in the field; and here he\r\nheaped up the treasures of his camp in one vast pile, which was to be\r\nhis funeral pyre should his camp be stormed. It was here that the Gothic\r\nand Italian forces watched but dared not assail, their enemy in his\r\ndespair, after that great and terrible day of battle, when\r\n\r\n     \"The sound\r\n      Of conflict was o'erpast, the shout of all\r\n      Whom earth could send from her remotest bounds,\r\n      Heathen or faithful;--from thy hundred mouths,\r\n      That feed the Caspian with Riphean snows,\r\n      Huge Volga!  from famed Hypanis, which once\r\n      Cradled the Hun; from all the countless realms\r\n      Between Imaus and that utmost strand\r\n      Where columns of Herculean rock confront\r\n      The blown Atlantic; Roman, Goth, and Hun,\r\n      And Scythian strength of chivalry, that tread\r\n      The cold Codanian shore, or what far lands\r\n      Inhospitable drink Cimmerian floods,\r\n      Franks, Saxons, Suevic, and Sarmartian chiefs,\r\n      And who from green Armorica or Spain\r\n      Flocked to the work of death.\"\r\n      [Herbert's Attila, book i. line 13.]\r\n\r\nThe victory which the Roman general Aetius, with his Gothic allies, had\r\nthen gained over the Huns, was the last victory of Imperial Rome. But\r\namong the long Fasti of her triumphs, few can be found that, for their\r\nimportance and ultimate benefit to mankind, are comparable with this\r\nexpiring effort of her arms. It did not, indeed, open to her any new\r\ncareer of conquest; it did not consolidate the relics of her power; it\r\ndid not turn the rapid ebb of her fortunes. The mission of Imperial Rome\r\nwas, in truth, already accomplished. She had received and transmitted\r\nthrough her once ample dominion the civilization of Greece. She had\r\nbroken up the barriers of narrow nationalities among the various states\r\nand tribes that dwelt around the coast of the Mediterranean. She had\r\nfused these and many other races into one organized empire, bound\r\ntogether by a community of laws, of government and institutions. Under\r\nthe shelter of her full power the True Faith had arisen in the earth and\r\nduring the years of her decline it had been nourished to maturity, and\r\nhad overspread all the provinces that ever obeyed her sway. [See the\r\nIntroduction to Ranke's History of the Popes.] For no beneficial\r\npurpose to mankind could the dominion of the seven-hilled city have been\r\nrestored or prolonged. But it was all-important to mankind what nations\r\nshould divide among them Rome's rich inheritance of empire: whether the\r\nGermanic and Gothic warriors should form states and kingdoms out of\r\nthe fragments of her dominions, and become the free members of the\r\ncommonwealth of Christian Europe; or whether pagan savages from the\r\nwilds of Central Asia should crush the relics of classic civilization,\r\nand the early institutions of the christianized Germans, in one hopeless\r\nchaos of barbaric conquest. The Christian Vistigoths of King Theodoric\r\nfought and triumphed at Chalons, side by side with the legions of\r\nAetius. Their joint victory over the Hunnish host not only rescued for\r\na time from destruction the old age of Rome, but preserved for centuries\r\nof power and glory the Germanic element in the civilization of modern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIn order to estimate the full importance to mankind of the battle of\r\nChalons, we must keep steadily in mind who and what the Germans were,\r\nand the important distinctions between them and the numerous other races\r\nthat assailed the Roman Empire: and it is to be understood that the\r\nGothic and the Scandinavian nations are included in the German race.\r\nNow, \"in two remarkable traits the Germans differed from the Sarmatic,\r\nas well as from the Slavic nations, and, indeed, from all those other\r\nraces to whom the Greeks and Romans gave the designation of barbarians.\r\nI allude to their personal freedom and regards for the rights of men;\r\nsecondly, to the respect paid by them to the female sex and the chastity\r\nfor which the latter were celebrated among the people of the North.\r\nThese were the foundations of that probity of character, self-respect,\r\nand purity of manners which may be traced among the Germans and\r\nGoths even during pagan times, and which, when their sentiments were\r\nenlightened by Christianity, brought out those splendid traits of\r\ncharacter which distinguish the age of chivalry and romance.\" [See\r\nPrichard's Researches into the Physical History of Mankind, vol iii. p.\r\n423.] What the intermixture of the German stock with the classic, at\r\nthe fall of the Western Empire, has done for mankind may be best felt\r\nby watching, with Arnold, over how large a portion of the earth the\r\ninfluence of the German element is now extended.\r\n\r\n\"It affects, more or less, the whole west of Europe, from the head of\r\nthe Gulf of Bothnia to the most southern promontory of Sicily, from the\r\nOder and the Adriatic to the Hebrides and to Lisbon. It is true that the\r\nlanguage spoken over a large portion of this space is not predominantly\r\nGerman; but even in France, and Italy, and Spain, the influence of the\r\nFranks, Burgundians, Visigoths, Ostrogoths, and Lombards, while it has\r\ncoloured even the language, has in blood and institutions left its mark\r\nlegibly and indelibly. Germany, the Low Countries, Switzerland for the\r\nmost part, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and our own islands, are all in\r\nlanguage, in blood, and in institutions, German most decidedly. But\r\nall South America is peopled with Spaniards and Portuguese; all North\r\nAmerica, and all Australia with Englishmen. I say nothing of the\r\nprospects and influence of the German race in Africa and in India: it\r\nis enough to say that half of Europe, and all America and Australia,\r\nare German, more or less completely, in race, in language, or in\r\ninstitutions, or in all.\" [Arnold's Lectures on Modern History, p. 35.]\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the fifth century, Germanic nations had settled\r\nthemselves in many of the fairest regions of the Roman empire,\r\nhad imposed their yoke on the provincials, and had undergone, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, that moral conquest which the arts and refinements\r\nof the vanquished in arms have so often achieved over the rough victor.\r\nThe Visigoths held the north of Spain and Gaul south of the Loire.\r\nFranks, Alemanni, Alans, and Burgundians had established themselves in\r\nother Gallic provinces, and the Suevi were masters of a large southern\r\nportion of the Spanish peninsula. A king of the Vandals reigned in\r\nNorth Africa, and the Ostrogoths had firmly planted themselves in the\r\nprovinces north of Italy. Of these powers and principalities, that of\r\nthe Visigoths, under their king Theodoric, son of Alaric, was by far the\r\nfirst in power and in civilization.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the Huns upon Europe had first been felt in the fourth\r\ncentury of our era. They had long been formidable to the Chinese empire;\r\nbut the ascendency in arms which another nomadic tribe of Central Asia,\r\nthe Sienpi gained over them, drove the Huns from their Chinese conquests\r\nwestward; and this movement once being communicated to the whole chain\r\nof barbaric nations that dwelt northward of the Black Sea and the Roman\r\nempire, tribe after tribe of savage warriors broke in upon the barriers\r\nof civilized Europe, \"velut unda supervenit undam.\" The Huns crossed the\r\nTanais into Europe in 375, and rapidly reduced to subjection the Alans,\r\nthe Ostrogoths, and other tribes that were then dwelling along the\r\ncourse of the Danube. The armies of the Roman emperor that tried to\r\ncheck their progress were cut to pieces by them; and Panonia and other\r\nprovinces south of the Danube were speedily occupied by the victorious\r\ncavalry of these new invaders. Not merely the degenerate Romans, but the\r\nbold and hardy warriors of Germany and Scandinavia were appalled at the\r\nnumbers, the ferocity, the ghastly appearance, and the lightning-like\r\nrapidity of the Huns. Strange and loathsome legends were coined and\r\ncredited, which attributed their origin to the union of \"Secret, black,\r\nand midnight hags\" with the evil spirits of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nTribe after tribe, and city after city, fell before them. Then came\r\na pause in their career of conquest in South-western Europe caused\r\nprobably by dissensions among their chiefs, and also by their arms being\r\nemployed in attack upon the Scandinavian nations. But when Attila (or\r\nAtzel, as he is called in the Hungarian language) became their ruler,\r\nthe torrent of their arms was directed with augmented terrors upon the\r\nwest and the south; and their myriads marched beneath the guidance of\r\none master-mind to the overthrow both of the new and the old powers of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nRecent events have thrown such a strong interest over everything\r\nconnected with the Hungarian name, that even the terrible name of Attila\r\nnow impresses us the more vividly through our sympathising admiration of\r\nthe exploits of those who claim to be descended from his warriors, and\r\n\"ambitiously insert the name of Attila among their native kings.\" The\r\nauthenticity of this martial genealogy is denied by some writers, and\r\nquestioned by more. But it is at least certain that the Magyars of\r\nArpad, who are the immediate ancestors of the bulk of the modern\r\nHungarians, and who conquered the country which bears the name of\r\nHungary in A.D. 889, were of the same stock of mankind as were the Huns\r\nof Attila, even if they did not belong to the same subdivision of that\r\nstock. Nor is there any improbability in the tradition, that after\r\nAttila's death many of his warriors remained in Hungary, and that their\r\ndescendants afterwards joined the Huns of Arpad in their career of\r\nconquest. It is certain that Attila made Hungary the seat of his empire.\r\nIt seems also susceptible of clear proof that the territory was then\r\ncalled Hungvar, and Attila's soldiers Hungvari. Both the Huns of Attila\r\nand those of Arpad came from the family of nomadic nations, whose\r\nprimitive regions were those vast wildernesses of High Asia which are\r\nincluded between the Altaic and the Himalayan mountain-chains. The\r\ninroads of these tribes upon the lower regions of Asia and into Europe,\r\nhave caused many of the most remarkable revolutions in the history of\r\nthe world. There is every reason to believe that swarms of these nations\r\nmade their way into distant parts of the earth, at periods long before\r\nthe date of the Scythian invasion of Asia, which is the earliest inroad\r\nof the nomadic race that history records. The first, as far as we can\r\nconjecture, in respect to the time of their descent were the Finnish and\r\nUgrian tribes, who appear to have come down from the Asiatic border of\r\nHigh Asia towards the north-west, in which direction they advanced\r\nto the Uralian mountains. There they established themselves: and that\r\nmountain chain, with its valleys and pasture-lands, became to them a\r\nnew country, whence they sent out colonies on every side; but the Ugrian\r\ncolony, which under Arpad occupied Hungary, and became the ancestors of\r\nthe bulk of the present Hungarian nation, did not quit their settlements\r\non the Uralian mountains till a very late period, not until four\r\ncenturies after the time when Attila led from the primary seats of the\r\nnomadic races in High Asia the host with which he advanced into the\r\nheart of France. [See Prichard's Researches into the Physical History of\r\nMankind.] That host was Turkish; but closely allied in origin, language,\r\nand habits, with the Finno-Ugrian settlers on the Ural.\r\n\r\nAttila's fame has not come down to us through the partial and suspicious\r\nmedium of chroniclers and poets of his own race. It is not from Hunnish\r\nauthorities that we learn the extent of his might: It is from his\r\nenemies, from the literature and the legends of the nations whom he\r\nafflicted with his arms, that we draw the unquestionable evidence of\r\nhis greatness. Besides the express narratives of Byzantine, Latin, and\r\nGothic writers, we have the strongest proof of the stern reality of\r\nAttila's conquests in the extent to which he and his Huns have been the\r\nthemes of the earliest German and Scandinavian lays. Wild as many of\r\nthese legends are, they bear concurrent and certain testimony to the awe\r\nwith which the memory of Attila was regarded by the bold warriors who\r\ncomposed and delighted in them. Attila's exploits, and the wonders of\r\nhis unearthly steed and magic sword, repeatedly occur in the Sagas\r\nof Norway and Iceland; and the celebrated Niebelungen Lied, the most\r\nancient of Germanic poetry, is full of them. There Etsel or Attila, is\r\ndescribed as the wearer of twelve mighty crowns, and as promising to\r\nhis bride the lands of thirty kings, whom his irresistible sword has\r\nsubdued. He is, in fact, the hero of the latter part of this remarkable\r\npoem; and it is at his capital city, Etselenburgh, which evidently\r\ncorresponds to the modern Buda, that much of its action takes place.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from the legendary to the historic Attila, we see\r\nclearly that he was not one of the vulgar herd of barbaric conquerors.\r\nConsummate military skill may be traced in his campaigns; and he relied\r\nfar less on the brute force of armies for the aggrandizement of his\r\nempire, than on the unbounded influence over the affections of friends\r\nand the fears of foes which his genius enabled him to acquire.\r\nAusterely sober in his private life, severely just on the judgment-seat,\r\nconspicuous among a nation of warriors for hardihood, strength, and\r\nskill in every martial exercise, grave and deliberate in counsel, but\r\nrapid and remorseless in execution, he gave safety and security to all\r\nwho were under his dominion, while he waged a warfare of extermination\r\nagainst all who opposed or sought to escape from it. He matched the\r\nnational passions, the prejudices, the creeds, and the superstitions of\r\nthe varied nations over which he ruled, and of those which he sought to\r\nreduce beneath his sway: and these feelings he had the skill to turn\r\nto his own account. His own warriors believed him to be the inspired\r\nfavourite of their deities, and followed him with fanatic zeal: his\r\nenemies looked on him as the pre-appointed minister of Heaven's wrath\r\nagainst themselves; and, though they believed not in his creed, their\r\nown made them tremble before him.\r\n\r\nIn one of his early campaigns he appeared before his troops with an\r\nancient iron sword in his grasp, which he told them was the god of war\r\nwhom their ancestors had worshipped. It is certain that the nomadic\r\ntribes of Northern Asia, whom Herodotus described under the name of\r\nScythians, from the earliest times worshipped as their god a bare sword.\r\nThat sword-God was supposed, in Attila's time, to have disappeared from\r\nearth; but the Hunnish king now claimed to have received it by special\r\nrevelation. It was said that a herdsman, who was tracking in the desert\r\na wounded heifer by the drops of blood, found the mysterious sword\r\nstanding fixed in the ground, as if it had been darted down from heaven.\r\nThe herdsman bore it to Attila, who thenceforth was believed by the Huns\r\nto wield the Spirit of Death in battle; and the seers prophesied that\r\nthat sword was to destroy the world. A Roman, [Priscus.] who was on\r\nan embassy to the Hunnish camp, recorded in his memoirs Attila's\r\nacquisition of this supernatural weapon, and the immense influence over\r\nthe minds of the barbaric tribes which its possession gave him. In the\r\ntitle which he assumed, we shall see the skill with which he availed\r\nhimself of the legends and creeds of other nations as well as of his\r\nown. He designated himself \"ATTILA, Descendant of the Great Nimrod.\r\nNurtured in Engaddi. By the Grace of God, King of the Huns, the Goths,\r\nthe Danes, and the Medes. The Dread of the World.\"\r\n\r\nHerbert states that Attila is represented on an old medallion with a\r\nTeraphim, or a head, on his breast; and the same writer adds: \"We know,\r\nfrom the 'Hamartigenea' of Prudentius, that Nimrod, with a snaky-haired\r\nhead, was the object of adoration to the heretical followers of Marcion;\r\nand the same head was the palladium set up by Antiochus Epiphanes over\r\nthe gates of Antioch, though it has been called the visage of Charon.\r\nThe memory of Nimrod was certainly regarded with mystic veneration by\r\nmany; and by asserting himself to be the heir of that mighty hunter\r\nbefore the Lord, he vindicated to himself at least the whole Babylonian\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n\"The singular assertion in his style, that he was nurtured in Engaddi\r\nwhere he certainly, had never been, will be more easily understood on\r\nreference to the twelfth chapter of the Book of Revelation, concerning\r\nthe woman clothed with the sun, who was to bring forth in the\r\nwilderness--'where she hath a place prepared of God'--a man-child, who\r\nwas to contend with the dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and\r\nrule all nations with a rod of iron. This prophecy was at that time\r\nunderstood universally by the sincere Christians to refer to the birth\r\nof Constantine, who was to overwhelm the paganism of the city on the\r\nseven hills, and it is still so explained; but it is evident that the\r\nheathens must have looked on it in a different light, and have regarded\r\nit as a foretelling of the birth of that Great One who should master the\r\ntemporal power of Rome. The assertion, therefore, that he was nurtured\r\nin Engaddi, is a claim to be looked upon as that man-child who was to\r\nbe brought forth in a place prepared of God in the wilderness. Engaddi\r\nmeans, a place of palms and vines, in the desert; it was hard by Zoar,\r\nthe city of refuge, which was saved in the vale of Siddim, or Demons,\r\nwhen the rest were destroyed by fire and brimstone from the Lord in\r\nheaven, and might, therefore, be especially called a place prepared of\r\nGod in the wilderness.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious enough why he styled himself \"By the grace of God, King of\r\nthe Huns and Goths;\" and it seems far from difficult to see why he added\r\nthe names of the Medes and the Danes. His armies had been engaged in\r\nwarfare against the Persian kingdom of the Sassanidae; and it is\r\ncertain [See the narrative of Priscus.] that he meditated the attack\r\nand overthrow of the Medo-Persian power. Probably some of the northern\r\nprovinces of that kingdom had been compelled to pay him tribute; and\r\nthis would account for his styling himself King of the Medes, they being\r\nhis remotest subjects to the south. From a similar cause he may have\r\ncalled himself King of the Danes, as his power may well have extended\r\nnorthwards as far as the nearest of the Scandinavian nations; and\r\nthis mention of Medes and Danes as his subjects would serve at once to\r\nindicate the vast extent of his dominion. [In the \"Niebelungen-Lied,\"\r\nthe old poet who describes the reception of the heroine Chrimhild by\r\nAttila (Etsel) says that Attila's dominions were so vast, that among his\r\nsubject-warriors there were Russian, Greek, Wallachian, Polish, and even\r\nDANISH KNIGHTS.]\r\n\r\nThe extensive territory north of the Danube and Black sea, and eastward\r\nof Caucasus, over which Attila ruled, first in conjunction with his\r\nbrother Bleda, and afterwards alone, cannot be very accurately defined;\r\nbut it must have comprised within it, besides the Huns, many nations of\r\nSlavic, Gothic, Teutonic, and Finnish origin. South also of the Danube,\r\nthe country from the river Sau as far as Novi in Thrace was a Hunnish\r\nprovince. Such was the empire of the Huns in A.D. 445; a memorable year,\r\nin which Attila founded Buda on the Danube as his capital city; and\r\nridded himself of his brother by a crime, which seems to have been\r\nprompted not only by selfish ambition, but also by a desire of turning\r\nto his purpose the legends and forebodings which then were universally\r\nspread throughout the Roman empire, and must have been well known to the\r\nwatchful and ruthless Hun.\r\n\r\nThe year 445 of our era completed the twelfth century from the\r\nfoundation of Rome, according to the best chronologers. It had always\r\nbeen believed among the Romans that the twelve vultures which were said\r\nto have appeared to Romulus when he founded the city, signified the time\r\nduring which the Roman power should endure. The twelve vultures denoted\r\ntwelve centuries. This interpretation of the vision of the birds of\r\ndestiny was current among learned Romans, even when there were yet many\r\nof the twelve centuries to run, and while the imperial city was at the\r\nzenith of its power. But as the allotted time drew nearer and nearer to\r\nits conclusion, and as Rome grew weaker and weaker beneath the blows\r\nof barbaric invaders, the terrible omen was more and more talked\r\nand thought of; and in Attila's time, men watched for the momentary\r\nextinction of the Roman state with the last beat of the last vulture's\r\nwing. Moreover, among the numerous legends connected with the foundation\r\nof the city, and the fratricidal death of Remus, there was one most\r\nterrible one, which told that Romulus did not put his brother to death\r\nin accident, or in hasty quarrel, but that\r\n\r\n     \"He slew his gallant twin\r\n      With inexpiable sin.\"\r\n\r\ndeliberately, and in compliance with the warnings of supernatural\r\npowers. The shedding of a brother's blood was believed to have been the\r\nprice at which the founder of Rome had purchased from destiny her twelve\r\ncenturies of existence. [See a curious justification of Attila's murder\r\nof his brother, by a zealous Hungarian advocate, in the note to Pray's\r\n\"Annales Hunnorum,\" p. 117. The example of Romulus is the main authority\r\nquoted.]\r\n\r\nWe may imagine, therefore, with what terror in this, the\r\ntwelve-hundredth year after the foundation of Rome, the inhabitants of\r\nthe Roman empire must have heard the tidings that the royal brethren,\r\nAttila and Bleda, had founded a new capitol on the Danube, which was\r\ndesigned to rule over the ancient capitol on the Tiber; and that Attila,\r\nlike Romulus, had consecrated the foundations of his new city by\r\nmurdering his brother; so that, for the new cycle of centuries then\r\nabout to commence, dominion had been bought from the gloomy spirits of\r\ndestiny in favour of the Hun, by a sacrifice of equal awe and value with\r\nthat which had formerly obtained it for the Romans.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that not only the pagans, but also the Christians\r\nof that age, knew and believed in these legends and omens, however they\r\nmight differ as to the nature of the superhuman agency by which such\r\nmysteries had been made known to mankind. And we may observe, with\r\nHerbert, a modern learned dignitary of our Church, how remarkably this\r\naugury was fulfilled. For, \"if to the twelve centuries denoted by the\r\ntwelve vultures that appeared to Romulus, we add for the six birds that\r\nappeared to Remus six lustra, or periods of five years each, by which\r\nthe Romans were wont to number their time, it brings us precisely to\r\nthe year 476, in which the Roman empire was finally extinguished by\r\nOdoacer.\"\r\n\r\nAn attempt to assassinate Attila, made, or supposed to have been\r\nmade, at the instigation of Theodosius the Younger, the Emperor of\r\nConstantinople, drew the Hunnish armies, in 445, upon the Eastern\r\nempire, and delayed for a time the destined blow against Rome. Probably\r\na more important cause of delay was the revolt of some of the Hunnish\r\ntribes to the north of the Black Sea against Attila, which broke out\r\nabout this period, and is cursorily mentioned by the Byzantine writers.\r\nAttila quelled this revolt; and having thus consolidated his power, and\r\nhaving punished the presumption of the Eastern Roman emperor by fearful\r\nravages of his fairest provinces, Attila, A.D. 450, prepared to set\r\nhis vast forces in motion for the conquest of Western Europe. He\r\nsought unsuccessfully by diplomatic intrigues to detach the King of the\r\nVisigoths from his alliance with Rome, and he resolved first to crush\r\nthe power of Theodoric, and then to advance with overwhelming power to\r\ntrample out the last sparks of the doomed Roman empire.\r\n\r\nA strong invitation from a Roman princess gave him a pretext for\r\nthe war, and threw an air of chivalric enterprise over his invasion.\r\nHonoria, sister of Valentinian III., the Emperor of the West, had sent\r\nto Attila to offer him her hand, and her supposed right to share in the\r\nimperial power. This had been discovered by Romans, and Honoria had been\r\nforthwith closely imprisoned, Attila now pretended to take up arms in\r\nbehalf of his self-promised bride, and proclaimed that he was about to\r\nmarch to Rome to redress Honoria's wrongs. Ambition and spite against\r\nher brother must have been the sole motives that led the lady to woo the\r\nroyal Hun for Attila's face and person had all the national ugliness of\r\nhis race and the description given of him by a Byzantine ambassador must\r\nhave been well known in the imperial courts. Herbert has well versified\r\nthe portrait drawn by Priscus of the great enemy of both Byzantium and\r\nRome:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Terrific was his semblance, in no mould\r\n      Of beautiful proportion cast; his limbs\r\n      Nothing exalted, but with sinews braced\r\n      Of Chalybaean temper, agile, lithe,\r\n      And swifter than the roe; his ample chest\r\n      Was overbrowed by a gigantic head,\r\n      With eyes keen, deeply sunk, and small, that gleam'd\r\n      Strangely in wrath, as though some spirit unclean\r\n      Within that corporal tenement installed\r\n      Look'd from its windows, but with temper'd fire\r\n      Beam'd mildly on the unresisting. Thin\r\n      His beard and hoary; his flat nostrils crown'd\r\n      A cicatrised, swart visage,--but withal\r\n      That questionable shape such glory wore\r\n      That mortals quail'd beneath him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo chiefs of the Franks, who were then settled on the lower Rhine, were\r\nat this period engaged in a feud with each other: and while one of them\r\nappealed to the Romans for aid, the other invoked the assistance and\r\nprotection of the Huns. Attila thus obtained an ally whose co-operation\r\nsecured for him the passage of the Rhine; and it was this circumstance\r\nwhich caused him to take a northward route from Hungary for his attack\r\nupon Gaul. The muster of the Hunnish hosts was swollen by warriors of\r\nevery tribe that they had subjugated; nor is there any reason to suspect\r\nthe old chroniclers of wilful exaggeration in estimating Attila's army\r\nat seven hundred thousand strong. Having crossed the Rhine, probably\r\na little below Coblentz, he defeated the King of the Burgundians, who\r\nendeavoured to bar his progress. He then divided his vast forces into\r\ntwo armies,--one of which marched north-west upon Tongres and Arras,\r\nand the other cities of that part of France; while the main body, under\r\nAttila himself marched up the Moselle, and destroyed Besancon, and other\r\ntowns in the country of the Burgundians. One of the latest and best\r\nbiographers of Attila well observes, that, \"having thus conquered the\r\neastern part of France, Attila prepared for an invasion of the West\r\nGothic territories beyond the Loire. He marched upon Orleans, where he\r\nintended to force the passage of that river; and only a little attention\r\nis requisite to enable us to perceive that he proceeded on a systematic\r\nplan: he had his right wing on the north, for the protection of his\r\nFrank allies; his left wing on the south, for the purpose of preventing\r\nthe Burgundians from rallying, and of menacing the passes of the Alps\r\nfrom Italy; and he led his centre towards the chief object of the\r\ncampaign--the conquest of Orleans, and an easy passage into the West\r\nGothic dominion. The whole plan is very like that of the allied powers\r\nin 1814, with this difference, that their left wing entered France\r\nthrough the defiles of the Jura, in the direction of Lyons, and that the\r\nmilitary object of the campaign was the capture of Paris.\" [Biographical\r\nDictionary commenced by the Useful Knowledge Society in 1844.]\r\n\r\nIt was not until the year 451 that the Huns commenced the siege of\r\nOrleans; and during their campaign in Eastern Gaul, the Roman general\r\nAetius had strenuously exerted himself in collecting and organizing such\r\nan army as might, when united to the soldiery of the Visigoths, be fit\r\nto face the Huns in the field. He enlisted every subject of the Roman\r\nempire whom patriotism, courage, or compulsion could collect beneath the\r\nstandards; and round these troops, which assumed the once proud title of\r\nthe legions of Rome, he arrayed the large forces of barbaric auxiliaries\r\nwhom pay, persuasion, or the general hate and dread of the Huns, brought\r\nto the camp of the last of the Roman generals. King Theodoric exerted\r\nhimself with equal energy, Orleans resisted her besiegers bravely as in\r\nafter times. The passage of the Loire was skilfully defended against the\r\nHuns; and Aetius and Theodoric, after much manoeuvring and difficulty,\r\neffected a junction of their armies to the south of that important\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nOn the advance of the allies upon Orleans, Attila instantly broke up the\r\nsiege of that city, and retreated towards the Marne. He did not choose\r\nto risk a decisive battle with only the central corps of his army\r\nagainst the combined power of his enemies; and he therefore fell\r\nback upon his base of operations; calling in his wings from Arras and\r\nBesancon, and concentrating the whole of the Hunnish forces on the\r\nvast plains of Chalons-sur-Marne. A glance at the map will show how\r\nscientifically this place was chosen by the Hunnish general, as the\r\npoint for his scattered forces to converge upon; and the nature of the\r\nground was eminently favourable for the operations of cavalry, the arm\r\nin which Attila's strength peculiarly lay.\r\n\r\nIt was during the retreat from Orleans that a Christian is reported to\r\nhave approached the Hunnish king, and said to him, \"Thou art the Scourge\r\nof God for the chastisement of Christians.\" Attila instantly assumed\r\nthis new title of terror, which thenceforth became the appellation by\r\nwhich he was most widely and most fearfully known.\r\n\r\nThe confederate armies of Romans and Visigoths at last met their great\r\nadversary, face to face, on the ample battle-ground of the Chalons\r\nplains. Aetius commanded on the right of the allies; King Theodoric on\r\nthe left; and Sangipan, king of the Alans, whose fidelity was suspected,\r\nwas placed purposely in the centre and in the very front of the\r\nbattle. Attila commanded his centre in person, at the head of his own\r\ncountrymen, while the Ostrogoths, the Gepidae, and the other subject\r\nallies of the Huns, were drawn up on the wings. Some manoeuvring\r\nappears to have occurred before the engagement, in which Attila had the\r\nadvantage, inasmuch as he succeeded in occupying a sloping hill, which\r\ncommanded the left flank of the Huns. Attila saw the importance of the\r\nposition taken by Aetius on the high ground, and commenced the battle\r\nby a furious attack on this part of the Roman line, in which he seems to\r\nhave detached some of his best troops from his centre to aid his left.\r\nThe Romans having the advantage of the ground, repulsed the Huns, and\r\nwhile the allies gained this advantage on their right, their left,\r\nunder King Theodoric, assailed the Ostrogoths, who formed the right of\r\nAttila's army. The gallant king was himself struck down by a javelin, as\r\nhe rode onward at the head of his men, and his own cavalry charging\r\nover him trampled him to death in the confusion. But the Visigoths,\r\ninfuriated, not dispirited, by their monarch's fall, routed the enemies\r\nopposed to them, and then wheeled upon the flank of the Hunnish centre,\r\nwhich had been engaged in a sanguinary and indecisive contest with the\r\nAlans.\r\n\r\nIn this peril Attila made his centre fall back upon his camp; and when\r\nthe shelter of its entrenchments and waggons had once been gained,\r\nthe Hunnish archers repulsed, without difficulty, the charges of the\r\nvengeful Gothic cavalry. Aetius had not pressed the advantage which he\r\ngained on his side of the field, and when night fell over the wild\r\nscene of havoc, Attila's left was still unbroken, but his right had been\r\nrouted, and his centre forced back upon his camp.\r\n\r\nExpecting an assault on the morrow, Attila stationed his best archers\r\nin front of the cars and waggons, which were drawn up as a fortification\r\nalong his lines, and made every preparation for a desperate resistance.\r\nBut the \"Scourge of God\" resolved that no man should boast of the honour\r\nof having either captured or slain him; and he caused to be raised in\r\nthe centre of his encampment a huge pyramid of the wooden saddles of his\r\ncavalry: round it he heaped the spoils and the wealth that he had won;\r\non it he stationed his wives who had accompanied him in the campaign;\r\nand on the summit he placed himself, ready to perish in the flames, and\r\nbaulk the victorious foe of their choicest booty, should they succeed in\r\nstorming his defences.\r\n\r\nBut when the morning broke, and revealed the extent of the carnage, with\r\nwhich the plains were heaped for miles, the successful allies saw also\r\nand respected the resolute attitude of their antagonist. Neither were\r\nany measures taken to blockade him in his camp, and so to extort by\r\nfamine that submission which it was too plainly perilous to enforce with\r\nthe sword. Attila was allowed to march back the remnants of his army\r\nwithout molestation, and even with the semblance of success.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the crafty Aetius was unwilling to be too\r\nvictorious. He dreaded the glory which his allies the Visigoths had\r\nacquired; and feared that Rome might find a second Alaric in Prince\r\nThorismund, who had signalized himself in the battle, and had been\r\nchosen on the field to succeed his father Theodoric. He persuaded the\r\nyoung king to return at once to his capital: and thus relieved himself\r\nat the same time of the presence of a dangerous friend, as well as of a\r\nformidable though beaten foe.\r\n\r\nAttila's attacks on the Western, empire were soon renewed; but never\r\nwith such peril to the civilized world as had menaced it before his\r\ndefeat at Chalons. And on his death, two years after that battle, the\r\nvast empire which his genius had founded was soon dissevered by the\r\nsuccessful revolts of the subject nations. The name of the Huns ceased\r\nfor some centuries to inspire terror in Western Europe, and their\r\nascendency passed away with the life of the great king by whom it had\r\nbeen so fearfully augmented. [If I seem to have given fewer of the\r\ndetails of the battle itself than its importance would warrant, my\r\nexcuse must be, that Gibbon has enriched our language with a description\r\nof it, too long for quotation and too splendid for rivalry. I have not,\r\nhowever, taken altogether the same view of it that he has. The notes to\r\nMr. Herbert's poem of \"Attila\" bring together nearly all the authorities\r\non the subject.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF EVENTS BETWEEN THE BATTLE OF CHALONS, A.D. 451, AND THE\r\nBATTLE OF TOURS, 732.\r\n\r\nA.D. 476. The Roman Empire of the West extinguished by Odoacer.\r\n\r\n482. Establishment of the French monarchy in Gaul by Clovis.\r\n\r\n455-482. The Saxons, Angles, and Frisians conquer Britain except the\r\nnorthern parts, and the districts along the west coast. The German\r\nconquerors found eight independent kingdoms.\r\n\r\n533-568. The generals of Justinian, the Emperor of Constantinople,\r\nconquer Italy and North Africa; and these countries are for a short time\r\nannexed to the Roman Empire of the East.\r\n\r\n568-570. The Lombards conquer great part of Italy.\r\n\r\n570-627. The wars between the Emperors of Constantinople and the Kings\r\nof Persia are actively continued.\r\n\r\n622. The Mahometan era of the Hegira. Mahomet is driven from Mecca, and\r\nis received as prince of Medina.\r\n\r\n629-632. Mahomet conquers Arabia.\r\n\r\n632-651. The Mahometan Arabs invade and conquer Persia.\r\n\r\n632-709. They attack the Roman Empire of the East. They conquer Syria,\r\nEgypt, and Africa.\r\n\r\n709-713. They cross the straits of Gibraltar, and invade and conquer\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n\"At the death of Mohammad, in 632, his temporal and religious\r\nsovereignty embraced and was limited by the Arabian Peninsula. The Roman\r\nand Persian empires, engaged in tedious and indecisive hostility upon\r\nthe rivers of Mesopotamia and the Armenian mountains, were viewed by the\r\nambitious fanatics of his creed as their quarry. In the very first\r\nyear of Mohammad's immediate successor, Abubeker, each of these mighty\r\nempires was invaded. The crumbling fabric of Eastern despotism is never\r\nsecured against rapid and total subversion; a few victories, a few\r\nsieges, carried the Arabian arms from the Tigris to the Oxus, and\r\noverthrew, with the Sassanian dynasty, the ancient and famous religion\r\nthey had professed. Seven years of active and unceasing warfare sufficed\r\nto subjugate the rich province of Syria, though defended by numerous\r\narmies and fortified cities; and the Khalif Omar had scarcely returned\r\nthanks for the accomplishment of this conquest, when Amrou, his\r\nlieutenant, announced to him the entire reduction of Egypt. After some\r\ninterval, the Saracens won their way along the coast of Africa, as far\r\nas the Pillars of Hercules, and a third province was irretrievably torn\r\nfrom the Greek empire. These western conquests introduced them to fresh\r\nenemies, and ushered in more splendid successes. Encouraged by the\r\ndisunion of the Visigoths, and invited by treachery, Musa, the general\r\nof a master who sat beyond the opposite extremity of the Mediterranean\r\nSea, passed over into Spain, and within about two years the name of\r\nMohammad was invoked under the Pyrenees.\"--[HALLAM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. -- THE BATTLE OF TOURS, A.D. 732,\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The events that rescued our ancestors of Britain, and our\r\n   neighbours of Gaul, from the civil and religious yoke of the\r\n   Koran.\"--GIBBON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broad tract of champaign country which intervenes between the cities\r\nof Poictiers and Tours is principally composed of a succession of rich\r\npasture lands, which are traversed and fertilized by the Cher, the\r\nCreuse, the Vienne, the Claine, the Indre, and other tributaries of\r\nthe river Loire. Here and there, the ground swells into picturesque\r\neminences; and occasionally a belt of forest land, a brown heath, or a\r\nclustering series of vineyards, breaks the monotony of the wide-spread\r\nmeadows; but the general character of the land is that of a grassy\r\nplain, and it seems naturally adapted for the evolutions of numerous\r\narmies, especially of those vast bodies of cavalry which, principally\r\ndecided the fate of nations during the centuries that followed the\r\ndownfall of Rome, and preceded the consolidation of the modern European\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nThis region has been signalized by more than one memorable conflict; but\r\nit is principally interesting to the historian, by having been the scene\r\nof the great victory won by Charles Martel over the Saracens, A.D. 732,\r\nwhich gave a decisive check to the career of Arab conquest in Western\r\nEurope, rescued Christendom from Islam, preserved the relics of ancient\r\nand the germs of modern civilization, and re-established the old\r\nsuperiority of the Indo-European over the Semitic family of mankind.\r\n\r\nSismondi and Michelet have underrated the enduring interest of this\r\ngreat Appeal of Battle between the champions of the Crescent and the\r\nCross. But, if French writers have slighted the exploits of their\r\nnational hero, the Saracenic trophies of Charles Martel have had full\r\njustice done to them by English and German historians. Gibbon devotes\r\nseveral pages of his great work to the narrative of the battle of Tours,\r\nand to the consideration of the consequences which probably would\r\nhave resulted, if Abderrahman's enterprise had not been crushed by the\r\nFrankish chief. [Vol, vii. p. 11, ET SEQ. Gibbon's remark, that if the\r\nSaracen conquest had not then been checked, \"Perhaps the interpretation\r\nof the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her\r\npulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth\r\nof the revelation of Mahomat,\" has almost an air of regret.] Schlegel\r\nspeaks of this \"mighty victory\" in terms of fervent gratitude; and\r\ntells how \"the arms of Charles Martel saved and delivered the Christian\r\nnations of the West from the deadly grasp of all-destroying Islam;\"\r\n[Philosophy of History, p. 331.] and Ranke points out, as \"one of the\r\nmost important epochs in the history of the world, the commencement of\r\nthe eighth century; when, on the one side, Mahommedanism threatened to\r\noverspread Italy and Gaul, and on the other, the ancient idolatry of\r\nSaxony and Friesland once more forced its way across the Rhine. In this\r\nperil of Christian institutions, a youthful prince of Germanic race,\r\nKarl Martell, arose as their champion; maintained them with all the\r\nenergy which the necessity for self-defence calls forth, and finally\r\nextended them into new regions.\" [History of the Reformation in Germany,\r\nvol. i. p. 5.]\r\n\r\nArnold ranks the victory of Charles Martel even higher than the victory\r\nof Arminius, \"among those signal deliverances which have affected\r\nfor centuries the happiness of mankind.\" [History of the later Roman\r\nCommonwealth, vol ii. p. 317.] In fact, the more we test its importance,\r\nthe higher we shall be led to estimate it; and, though the authentic\r\ndetails which we possess of its circumstances and its heroes are but\r\nmeagre, we can trace enough of its general character to make us watch\r\nwith deep interest this encounter between the rival conquerors of the\r\ndecaying Roman empire. That old classic world, the history of which\r\noccupies so large a portion of our early studies, lay, in the eighth\r\ncentury of our era, utterly exanimate and overthrown. On the north the\r\nGerman, on the south the Arab, was rending away its provinces. At last\r\nthe spoilers encountered one another, each striving for the full mastery\r\nof the prey. Their conflict brought back upon the memory of Gibbon the\r\nold Homeric simile, where the strife of Hector and Patroclus over the\r\ndead body of Cebriones is compared to the combat of two lions, that\r\nin their hate and hunger fight together on the mountain-tops over the\r\ncarcass of a slaughtered stag: and the reluctant yielding of the Saracen\r\npower to the superior might of the Northern warriors, might not inaptly\r\nrecall those other lines of the same book of the Iliad, where the\r\ndownfall of Patroclus beneath Hector is likened to the forced yielding\r\nof the panting and exhausted wild boar, that had long and furiously\r\nfought with a superior beast of prey for the possession of the fountain\r\namong the rocks, at which each burned to drink.\r\n\r\nAlthough three centuries had passed away since the Germanic conquerors\r\nof Rome had crossed the Rhine, never to repass that frontier stream,\r\nno settled system of institutions or government, no amalgamation of the\r\nvarious races into one people, no uniformity of language or habits, had\r\nbeen established in the country, at the time when Charles Martel was\r\ncalled on to repel the menacing tide of Saracenic invasion from the\r\nsouth. Gaul was not yet France. In that, as in other provinces of the\r\nRoman empire of the West, the dominion of the Caesars had been shattered\r\nas early as the fifth century, and barbaric kingdoms and principalities\r\nhad promptly arisen on the ruins of the Roman power. But few of these\r\nhad any permanency; and none of them consolidated the rest, or any\r\nconsiderable number of the rest, into one coherent and organized civil\r\nand political society. The great bulk of the population still consisted\r\nof the conquered provincials, that is to say, of Romanized Celts, of a\r\nGallic race which had long been under the dominion of the Caesars,\r\nand had acquired, together with no slight infusion of Roman blood, the\r\nlanguage, the literature, the laws, and the civilization of Latium.\r\nAmong these, and dominant over them, roved or dwelt the German victors:\r\nsome retaining nearly all the rude independence of their primitive\r\nnational character; others, softened and disciplined by the aspect and\r\ncontact of the manners and institutions of civilized life. For it is to\r\nbe borne in mind, that the Roman empire in the West was not crushed by\r\nany sudden avalanche of barbaric invasion. The German conquerors came\r\nacross the Rhine, not in enormous hosts, but in bands of a few thousand\r\nwarriors at a time. The conquest of a province was the result of an\r\ninfinite series of partial local invasions, carried on by little armies\r\nof this description. The victorious warriors either retired with their\r\nbooty, or fixed themselves in the invaded district, taking care to keep\r\nsufficiently concentrated for military purposes, and ever ready for\r\nsome fresh foray, either against a rival Teutonic band, or some hitherto\r\nunassailed city of the provincials. Gradually, however, the conquerors\r\nacquired a desire for permanent landed possessions. They lost somewhat\r\nof the restless thirst for novelty and adventure which had first made\r\nthem throng beneath the banner of the boldest captains of their tribe,\r\nand leave their native forests for a roving military Life on the left\r\nbank of the Rhine. They were converted to the Christian faith; and gave\r\nup with their old creed much of the coarse ferocity, which must have\r\nbeen fostered in the spirits of the ancient warriors of the North by\r\na mythology which promised, as the reward of the brave on earth, an\r\neternal cycle of fighting and drunkenness in heaven.\r\n\r\nBut, although their conversion and other civilizing influences operated\r\npowerfully upon the Germans in Gaul; and although the Franks (who were\r\noriginally a confederation of the Teutonic tribes that dwelt between the\r\nRhine, the Maine, and the Weser) established a decided superiority over\r\nthe other conquerors of the province, as well as over the conquered\r\nprovincials, the country long remained a chaos of uncombined and\r\nshifting elements. The early princes of the Merovingian dynasty were\r\ngenerally occupied in wars against other princes of their house,\r\noccasioned by the frequent subdivisions of the Frank monarchy: and\r\nthe ablest and best of them had found all their energies tasked to the\r\nutmost to defend the barrier of the Rhine against the Pagan Germans, who\r\nstrove to pass that river and gather their share of the spoils of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nThe conquests which the Saracens effected over the southern and eastern\r\nprovinces of Rome were far more rapid than those achieved by the Germans\r\nin the north; and the new organizations of society which the Moslems\r\nintroduced were summarily and uniformly enforced. Exactly a century\r\npassed between the death of Mohammed and the date of the battle of\r\nTours. During that century the followers of the Prophet had torn away\r\nhalf the Roman empire; and besides their conquests over Persia, the\r\nSaracens had overrun Syria, Egypt, Africa, and Spain, in an unchequered\r\nand apparently irresistible career of victory. Nor, at the commencement\r\nof the eighth century of our era, was the Mohammedan world divided\r\nagainst itself, as it subsequently became. All these vast regions obeyed\r\nthe Caliph; throughout them all, from the Pyrenees to the Oxus, the name\r\nof Mohammed was invoked in prayer, and the Koran revered as the book of\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nIt was under one of their ablest and most renowned commanders, with\r\na veteran army, and with every apparent advantage of time, place, and\r\ncircumstance, that the Arabs made their great effort at the conquest of\r\nEurope north of the Pyrenees. The victorious Moslem soldiery in Spain,\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"A countless multitude;\r\n      Syrian, Moor, Saracen, Greek renegade,\r\n      Persian, and Copt, and Tartar, in one bond\r\n      Of erring faith conjoined--strong in the youth\r\n      And heat of zeal--a dreadful brotherhood,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nwere eager for the plunder of more Christian cities and shrines, and\r\nfull of fanatic confidence in the invincibility of their arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Nor were the chiefs\r\n      Of victory less assured, by long success\r\n      Elate, and proud of that o'erwhelming strength\r\n      Which surely, they believed, as it had rolled\r\n      Thus far uncheck'd, would roll victorious on,\r\n      Till, like the Orient, the subjected West\r\n      Should bow in reverence at Mahommed's name;\r\n      And pilrims from remotest Arctic shores\r\n      Tread with religious feet the burning sands\r\n      Of Araby and Mecca's stony soil.\"\r\n                                   SOUTHEY'S RODERICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not only by the modern Christian poet, but by the old Arabian\r\nchroniclers also, that these feelings of ambition and arrogance are\r\nattributed to the Moslems, who had overthrown the Visigoth power in\r\nSpain. And their eager expectations of new wars were excited to the\r\nutmost on the re-appointment by the Caliph of Abderrahman Ibn Abdillah\r\nAlghafeki to the government of that country, A.D. 729, which restored\r\nthem a general who had signalized his skill and prowess during the\r\nconquests of Africa and Spain, whose ready valour and generosity had\r\nmade him the idol of the troops, who had already been engaged in several\r\nexpeditions into Gaul, so as to be well acquainted with the national\r\ncharacter and tactics of the Franks; and who was known to thirst, like\r\na good Moslem, for revenge for the slaughter of some detachments of the\r\ntrue believers, which had been cut off on the north of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his cardinal military virtues, Abderrahman is described\r\nby the Arab writers as a model of integrity and justice. The first two\r\nyears of his second administration in Spain were occupied in severe\r\nreforms of the abuses which under his predecessors had crept into the\r\nsystem of government, and in extensive preparations for his intended\r\nconquest of Gaul. Besides the troops which he collected from his\r\nprovince, he obtained from Africa a large body of chosen Barber cavalry,\r\nofficered by Arabs of proved skill and valour: and in the summer of 732\r\nhe crossed the Pyrenees at the head of an army which some Arab writers\r\nrate at eighty thousand strong, while some of the Christian chroniclers\r\nswell its numbers to many hundreds of thousands more. Probably the Arab\r\naccount diminishes, but of the two keeps nearer to the truth. It was\r\nfrom this formidable host, after Eudes, the Count of Acquitaine, had\r\nvainly striven to check it, after many strong cities had fallen before\r\nit, and half the land been overrun, that Gaul and Christendom were\r\nat last rescued by the strong arm of Prince Charles, who acquired\r\na surname, [Martel--'The Hammer.' See the Scandinavian Sagas for an\r\naccount of the favourite weapon of Thor.] like that of the war-god of\r\nhis forefathers' creed, from the might with which he broke and shattered\r\nhis enemies in the battle.\r\n\r\nThe Merovingian kings had sunk into absolute insignificance, and had\r\nbecome mere puppets of royalty before the eighth century. Charles Martel\r\nlike his father, Pepin Heristal, was Duke of the Austrasian Franks, the\r\nbravest and most thoroughly Germanic part of the nation: and exercised,\r\nin the name of the titular king, what little paramount authority the\r\nturbulent minor rulers of districts and towns could be persuaded or\r\ncompelled to acknowledge. Engaged with his national competitors in\r\nperpetual conflicts for power, engaged also in more serious struggles\r\nfor safety against the fierce tribes of the unconverted Frisians,\r\nBavarians, Saxons, and Thuringians, who at that epoch assailed with\r\npeculiar ferocity the christianized Germans on the left bank of the\r\nRhine, Charles Martel added experienced skill to his natural courage,\r\nand he had also formed a militia of veterans among the Franks. Hallam\r\nhas thrown out a doubt whether, in our admiration of his victory at\r\nTours, we do not judge a little too much by the event, and whether there\r\nwas not rashness in his risking the fate of France on the result of a\r\ngeneral battle with the invaders. But, when we remember that Charles had\r\nno standing army, and the independent spirit of the Frank warriors who\r\nfollowed his standard, it seems most probable that it was not in his\r\npower to adopt the cautious policy of watching the invaders, and wearing\r\nout their strength by delay. So dreadful and so wide-spread were the\r\nravages of the Saracenic light cavalry throughout Gaul that it must have\r\nbeen impossible to restrain for any length of time the indignant ardour\r\nof the Franks. And, even if Charles could have persuaded his men to\r\nlook tamely on while the Arabs stormed more towns and desolated more\r\ndistricts, he could not have kept an army together when the usual period\r\nof a military expedition had expired. If, indeed, the Arab account of\r\nthe disorganization of the Moslem forces be correct, the battle was\r\nas well-timed on the part of Charles as it was beyond all question,\r\nwell-fought.\r\n\r\nThe monkish chroniclers, from whom we are obliged to glean a narrative\r\nof this memorable campaign, bear full evidence to the terror which the\r\nSaracen invasion inspired, and to the agony of that; great struggle. The\r\nSaracens, say they, and their king, who was called Abdirames, came out\r\nof Spain, with all their wives, and their children, and their substance,\r\nin such great multitudes that no man could reckon or estimate them. They\r\nbrought with them all their armour, and whatever they had, as if they\r\nwere thence forth always to dwell in France. [\"Lors issirent d'Espaigne\r\nli Sarrazins, et un leur Roi qui avoit nom Abdirames, et ont leur fames\r\net leur enfans at touts leur substance an si grand plente que nus ne\r\nle prevoit nombrer ne estimer: tout leur harnois et quanques il avoient\r\namenement avec ents, aussi comme si ils deussent toujours mes habiter en\r\nFrance.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Then Abderrahman, seeing the land filled with the multitude of his\r\narmy, pierces through the mountains, tramples over rough and level\r\nground plunders far into the country of the Franks, and smites all with\r\nthe sword, insomuch that when Eudo came to battle with him at the river\r\nGaronne, and fled before him, God alone knows the number of the slain.\r\nThen Abderrahman pursued after Count Eudo, and while he strives to\r\nspoil and burn the holy shrine at Tours, he encounters the chief of the\r\nAustrasian Franks, Charles, a man of war from his youth up, to whom Eudo\r\nhad sent warning. There for nearly seven days they strive intensely,\r\nand at last they set themselves in battle array; and the nations of\r\nthe north standing firm as a wall, and impenetrable as a zone of ice,\r\nutterly slay the Arabs with the edge of the sword.\" [\"Tunc Abdirrahman,\r\nmultitudine sui exercitus repletam prospiciane terram,\" &c.--SCRIPT.\r\nGEST. FRANC. p. 785.]\r\n\r\nThe European writers all concur in speaking of the fall of Abderrahman\r\nas one of the principal causes of the defeat of the Arabs; who,\r\naccording to one writer, after finding that their leader was slain,\r\ndispersed in the night, to the agreeable surprise of the Christians, who\r\nexpected the next morning to see them issue from their tents, and renew\r\nthe combat. One monkish chronicler puts the loss of the Arabs at 375,000\r\nmen, while he says that only 1,007 Christians fell--a disparity of\r\nloss which he feels bound to account for by a special interposition of\r\nProvidence. I have translated above some of the most spirited passages\r\nof these writers; but it is impossible to collect from them anything\r\nlike a full or authentic description of the great battle itself, or of\r\nthe operations which preceded or followed it.\r\n\r\nThough, however, we may have cause to regret the meagreness and doubtful\r\ncharacter of these narratives, we have the great advantage of being\r\nable to compare the accounts given of Abderrahman's expedition by the\r\nnational writers of each side. This is a benefit which the inquirer into\r\nantiquity so seldom can obtain, that the fact of possessing it, in the\r\ninstance of the battle of Tours, makes us think the historical testimony\r\nrespecting that great event more certain and satisfactory than is\r\nthe case in many other instances, where we possess abundant details\r\nrespecting military exploits, but where those details come to us from\r\nthe annalist of one nation only; and where we have, consequently, no\r\nsafeguard against the exaggerations, the distortions, and the fictions\r\nwhich national vanity has so often put forth in the garb and under the\r\ntitle of history. The Arabian writers who recorded the conquests and\r\nwars of their countrymen in Spain, have narrated also the expedition\r\ninto Gaul of their great Emir, and his defeat and death near Tours in\r\nbattle with the host of the Franks under King Caldus, the name into\r\nwhich they metamorphose Charles. [The Arabian chronicles were compiled\r\nand translated into Spanish by Don Jose Antonio Conde, in his \"Historia\r\nde la Dominacion de los Arabos an Espana,\" published at Madrid in 1820.\r\nConde's plan, which I have endeavoured to follow, was to present both\r\nthe style and spirit of his oriental authorities, so that we find in\r\nhis pages a genuine Saracenic narrative of the wars in Western Europe\r\nbetween the Mahommedans and the Christians.]\r\n\r\nThey tell us how there was war between the count of the Frankish\r\nfrontier and the Moslems, and how the count gathered together all his\r\npeople, and fought for a time with doubtful success. \"But,\" say the\r\nArabian chroniclers, \"Abderrahman drove them back; and the men of\r\nAbderrahman were puffed up in spirit by their repeated successes, and\r\nthey were full of trust in the valour and the practice in war of their\r\nEmir. So the Moslems smote their enemies, and passed the river Garonne,\r\nand laid waste the country, and took captives without number. And that\r\narmy went through all places like a desolating storm. Prosperity made\r\nthose warriors insatiable. At the passage of the river, Abderrahman\r\noverthrew the count, and the count retired into his stronghold, but the\r\nMoslems fought against it, and entered it by force, and slew the count;\r\nfor everything gave way to their scimetars, which were the robbers of\r\nlives. All the nations of the Franks trembled at that terrible army, and\r\nthey betook them to their king Caldus, and told him of the havoc made\r\nby the Moslem horsemen, and how they rode at their will through all the\r\nland of Narbonne Toulouse, and Bordeaux, and they told the king of the\r\ndeath of their count. Then the king bade them be of good cheer, and\r\noffered to aid them. And in the 114th year [Of the Hegira.] he mounted\r\nhis home, and he took with him a host that could not be numbered, and\r\nwent against the Moslems. And he came upon them at the great city of\r\nTours. And Abderrahman and other prudent cavaliers saw the disorder of\r\nthe Moslem troops, who were loaded with spoil; but they did not venture\r\nto displease the soldiers by ordering them to abandon everything except\r\ntheir arms and war-horses. And Abderrahman trusted in the valour of his\r\nsoldiers, and in the good fortune which had ever attended him. But\r\n(the Arab writer remarks) such defect of discipline always is fatal to\r\narmies. So Abderrahman and his host attacked Tours to gain still more\r\nspoil, and they fought against it so fiercely that they stormed the city\r\nalmost before the eyes of the army that came to save it; and the fury\r\nand the cruelty of the Moslems towards the inhabitants of the city were\r\nlike the fury and cruelty of raging tigers. It was manifest,\" adds the\r\nArab, \"that God's chastisement was sure to follow such excesses; and\r\nfortune thereupon turned her back upon the Moslems.\"\r\n\r\nNear the river Owar, [Probably the Loire.] the two great hosts of the\r\ntwo languages and the two creeds were set in array against each other.\r\nThe hearts of Abderrahman, his captains, and his men were filled with\r\nwrath and pride, and they were the first to begin the fight. The Moslem\r\nhorseman dashed fierce and frequent forward against the battalions of\r\nthe Franks, who resisted manfully, and many fell dead on either side,\r\nuntil the going down of the sun. Night parted the two armies: but in the\r\ngrey of the morning the Moslems returned to the battle. Their cavaliers\r\nhad soon hewn their way into the centre of the Christian host. But many\r\nof the Moslems were fearful for the safety of the spoil which they had\r\nstored in their tents, and a false cry arose in their ranks that some of\r\nthe enemy were plundering the camp; whereupon several squadrons of the\r\nMoslem horseman rode off to protect their tents. But it seemed as if\r\nthey fled; and all the host was troubled. And while Abderrahman strove\r\nto check their tumult, and to lead them back to battle, the warriors of\r\nthe Franks came around him, and he was pierced through with many spears,\r\nso that he died. Then all the host fled before the enemy, and many died\r\nin the flight. This deadly defeat of the Moslems, and the loss of the\r\ngreat leader and good cavalier Abderrahman, took place in the hundred\r\nand fifteenth year.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to expect from an adversary a more explicit\r\nconfession of having been thoroughly vanquished, than the Arabs here\r\naccord to the Europeans. The points on which their narrative differs\r\nfrom those of the Christians,--as to how many days the conflict\r\nlasted, whether the assailed city was actually rescued or not, and the\r\nlike,--are of little moment compared with the admitted great fact that\r\nthere was a decisive trial of strength between Frank and Saracen, in\r\nwhich the former conquered. The enduring importance of the battle\r\nof Tours in the eyes of the Moslems, is attested not only by the\r\nexpressions of \"the deadly battle,\" and \"the disgraceful overthrow,\"\r\nwhich their writers constantly employ when referring to it, but also\r\nby the fact that no further serious attempts at conquest beyond the\r\nPyrenees were made by the Saracens. Charles Martel, and his son and\r\ngrandson, were left at leisure to consolidate and extend their power.\r\nThe new Christian Roman Empire of the West, which the genius of\r\nCharlemagne founded, and throughout which his iron will imposed peace on\r\nthe old anarchy of creeds and races, did not indeed retain its integrity\r\nafter its great ruler's death. Fresh troubles came over Europe; but\r\nChristendom, though disunited, was safe. The progress of civilization,\r\nand the development of the nationalities and governments of modern\r\nEurope, from that time forth, went forward in not uninterrupted, but,\r\nultimately, certain career.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF EVENTS BETWEEN THE BATTLE OF TOURS, A.D. 732, AND THE BATTLE\r\nOF HASTINGS, 1066.\r\n\r\nA.D. 768-814. Reign of Charlemagne. This monarch has justly been termed\r\nthe principal regenerator of Western Europe, after the destruction of\r\nthe Roman empire. The early death of his brother, Carloman, left him\r\nsole master of the dominions of the Franks, which, by a succession\r\nof victorious wars, he enlarged into the new Empire of the West. He\r\nconquered the Lombards, and re-established the Pope at Rome, who, in\r\nreturn, acknowledged Charles as suzerain of Italy; and in the year 800,\r\nLeo III, in the name of the Roman people, solemnly crowned Charlemagne\r\nat Rome, as Emperor of the Roman Empire of the West. In Spain,\r\nCharlemagne ruled the country between the Pyrenees and the Ebro; but\r\nhis most important conquests were effected on the eastern side of\r\nhis original kingdom, over the Sclavonians of Bohemia, the Avars of\r\nPannonia, and over the previously uncivilized German tribes who had\r\nremained in their fatherland. The old Saxons were his most obstinate\r\nantagonists, and his wars with them lasted for thirty years. Under him\r\nthe greater part of Germany was compulsorily civilized, and converted\r\nfrom Paganism to Christianity, His empire extended eastward as far as\r\nthe Elbe, the Saal, the Bohemian mountains, and a line drawn from thence\r\ncrossing the Danube above Vienna, and prolonged to the Gulf of Istria.\r\n[Hallam's Middle Ages.]\r\n\r\nThroughout this vast assemblage of provinces, Charlemagne established an\r\norganized and firm government. But it is not as a mere conqueror that he\r\ndemands admiration. \"In a life restlessly active, we see him reforming\r\nthe coinage, and establishing the legal divisions of money, gathering\r\nabout him the learned of every country; founding schools and\r\ncollecting libraries; interfering, with the air of a king, in religious\r\ncontroversies; attempting, for the sake of commerce, the magnificent\r\nenterprise of uniting the Rhine and the Danube, and meditating to mould\r\nthe discordant code of Roman and barbarian laws into an uniform system.\"\r\n[Hallam, UT SUPRA.]\r\n\r\n814-888. Repeated partitions of the empire and civil wars between\r\nCharlemagne's descendants. Ultimately, the kingdom of France is finally\r\nseparated from Germany and Italy. In 982, Otho the Great, of Germany,\r\nrevives the imperial dignity.\r\n\r\n827. Egbert, king of Wessex, acquires the supremacy over the Anglo-Saxon\r\nkingdoms.\r\n\r\n832. The first Danish squadron attacks part of the English coast.\r\nThe Danes, or Northmen, had begun their ravages in France a few years\r\nearlier. For two centuries Scandinavia sends out fleet after fleet of\r\nsea-rovers, who desolate all the western kingdoms of Europe, and in many\r\ncases effect permanent conquests.\r\n\r\n871-900. Reign of Alfred in England. After a long and varied struggle,\r\nhe rescues England from the Danish invaders.\r\n\r\n911, The French king cedes Neustria to Hrolf the Northman. Hrolf (or\r\nDuke Rollo, as he thenceforth was termed) and his army of Scandinavian\r\nwarriors, become the ruling class of the population of the province,\r\nwhich is called after them Normandy.\r\n\r\n1016. Four knights from Normandy, who had been on a pilgrimage to the\r\nHoly Land, while returning through Italy, head the people of Salerno in\r\nrepelling an attack of a band of Saracen corsairs. In the next year many\r\nadventurers from Normandy settle in Italy, where they conquer Apulia\r\n(1040), and afterwards (1060) Sicily.\r\n\r\n1017. Canute, king of Denmark, becomes king of England. On the death of\r\nthe last of his sons, in 1041, the Saxon line is restored, and Edward\r\nthe Confessor (who had been bred in the court of the Duke of Normandy),\r\nis called by the English to the throne of this island, as the\r\nrepresentative of the House of Cerdic.\r\n\r\n1035. Duke Robert of Normandy dies on his return from a pilgrimage to\r\nthe Holy Land, and his son William (afterwards the conqueror of England)\r\nsucceeds to the dukedom of Normandy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. -- THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS, 1066.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Eis vos la Bataille assemblee,\r\n      Dunc encore est grant renomee.\"\r\n          ROMAN DE ROU, 1. 3183.\r\n\r\n\r\nArletta's pretty feet twinkling in the brook gained her a duke's love,\r\nand gave us William the Conqueror. Had she not thus fascinated Duke\r\nRobert, the Liberal, of Normandy, Harold would not have fallen at\r\nHastings, no Anglo-Norman dynasty could have arisen, no British empire.\r\nThe reflection is Sir Francis Palgrave's: [History of Normandy and\r\nEngland, vol. i. p. 528.] and it is emphatically true. If any one should\r\nwrite a history of \"Decisive loves that; have materially influenced the\r\ndrama of the world in all its subsequent scenes,\" the daughter of the\r\ntanner of Falaise would deserve a conspicuous place in his pages. But\r\nit is her son, the victor of Hastings, who is now the object of our\r\nattention; and no one, who appreciates the influence of England and her\r\nempire upon the destinies of the world, will ever rank that victory as\r\none of secondary importance.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the last century some writers of eminence on our\r\nhistory and laws mentioned the Norman Conquest in terms, from which it\r\nmight be supposed that the battle of Hastings led to little more than\r\nthe substitution of one royal family for another on the throne of this\r\ncountry, and to the garbling and changing of some of our laws through\r\nthe \"cunning of the Norman lawyers.\" But, at least since the appearance\r\nof the work of Augustin Thierry on the Norman Conquest, these forensic\r\nfallacies have been exploded. Thierry made his readers keenly appreciate\r\nthe magnitude of that political and social catastrophe. He depicted\r\nin vivid colours the atrocious cruelties of the conquerors, and the\r\nsweeping and enduring innovations that they wrought, involving the\r\noverthrow of the ancient constitution, as well as of the last of the\r\nSaxon kings. In his pages we see new tribunals and tenures superseding\r\nthe old ones, new divisions of race and class introduced, whole\r\ndistricts devastated to gratify the vengeance or the caprice of the new\r\ntyrant, the greater part of the lands of the English confiscated\r\nand divided among aliens, the very name of Englishmen turned into a\r\nreproach, the English language rejected as servile and barbarous, and\r\nall the high places in Church and State for upwards of a century filled\r\nexclusively by men of foreign race.\r\n\r\nNo less true than eloquent is Thierry's summing up of the social effects\r\nof the Norman Conquest on the generation that witnessed it, and on many\r\nof their successors. He tells his reader that \"if he would form a just\r\nidea of England conquered by William of Normandy, he must figure to\r\nhimself, not a mere change of political rule, not the triumph of one\r\ncandidate over another candidate, of the man of one party over the man\r\nof another party; but the intrusion of one people into the bosom of\r\nanother people, the violent placing of one society over another society,\r\nwhich it came to destroy, and the scattered fragments of which it\r\nretained only as personal property, or (to use the words of an old act)\r\nas 'the clothing of the soil:' he must not picture to himself on the one\r\nhand, William, a king and a despot--on the other, subjects of William's,\r\nhigh and low, rich and poor, all inhabiting England, and consequently\r\nall English; but he must imagine two nations, of one of which William\r\nis a member and the chief--two nations which (if the term must be used)\r\nwere both subject to William, but as applied to which the word has quite\r\ndifferent senses, meaning in the one case subordinate, in the other\r\nsubjugated. He must consider that there are two countries, two soils,\r\nincluded in the same geographical circumference; that of the Normans\r\nrich and free, that of the Saxons poor and serving, vexed by RENT and\r\nTAILLAGE; the former full of spacious mansions, and walled and moated\r\ncastles, the latter scattered over with huts and straw, and ruined\r\nhovels; that peopled with the happy and the idle, with men of the army\r\nand of the court, with knights and nobles,--this with men of pain\r\nand labour, with farmers and artizans: on the one side, luxury and\r\ninsolence, on the other, misery and envy--not the envy of the poor at\r\nthe sight of opulence they cannot reach, but the envy of the despoiled\r\nwhen in presence of the despoilers.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the effect of Thierry's work has been to cast into the shade the\r\nultimate good effects on England of the Norman Conquest. Yet these are\r\nas undeniable as are the miseries which that conquest inflicted on our\r\nSaxon ancestors from the time of the battle of Hastings to the time of\r\nthe signing of the Great Charter at Runnymede. That last is the true\r\nepoch of English nationality: it is the epoch when Anglo-Norman and\r\nAnglo-Saxon ceased to keep aloof from each other, the one in haughty\r\nscorn, the other in sullen abhorrence; and when all the free men of the\r\nland; whether barons, knights, yeomen, or burghers, combined to lay the\r\nfoundations of English freedom.\r\n\r\nOur Norman barons were the chiefs of that primary constitutional\r\nmovement; those \"iron barons\" whom Chatham has so nobly eulogized.\r\nThis alone should make England remember her obligations to the Norman\r\nConquest, which planted far and wide, as a dominant class in her land,\r\na martial nobility of the bravest and most energetic race that ever\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nIt may sound paradoxical, but it is in reality no exaggeration to say,\r\nwith Guizot, [Essais sur l'Histoirs de France, p. 273, et seq.] that\r\nEngland owes her liberties to her having been conquered by the Normans.\r\nIt is true that the Saxon institutions were the primitive cradle of\r\nEnglish liberty, but by their own intrinsic force they could never have\r\nfounded the enduring free English constitution. It was the Conquest that\r\ninfused into them a new virtue; and the political liberties of England\r\narose from the situation in which the Anglo-Saxon and the Anglo-Norman\r\npopulations and laws found themselves placed relatively to each other\r\nin this island. The state of England under her last Anglo-Saxon kings\r\nclosely resembled the state of France under the last Carlovingian, and\r\nthe first Capetian princes. The crown was feeble, the great nobles were\r\nstrong and turbulent. And although there was more national unity\r\nin Saxon England than in France; although the English local free\r\ninstitutions had more reality and energy than was the case with anything\r\nanalogous to them on the Continent in the eleventh century, still the\r\nprobability is that the Saxon system of polity, if left to itself, would\r\nhave fallen into utter confusion, out of which would have arisen first\r\nan aristocratic hierarchy like that which arose in France, next an\r\nabsolute monarchy, and finally a series of anarchical revolutions, such\r\nas we now behold around, but not among us. [See Guizot, UT SUPRA.]\r\n\r\nThe latest conquerors of this island were also the bravest and the best.\r\nI do not except even the Romans. And, in spite of our sympathies with\r\nHarold and Hereward, and our abhorrence of the founder of the New\r\nForest, and the desolator of Yorkshire, we must confess the superiority\r\nof the Normans to the Anglo-Saxons and Anglo-Danes, whom they met here\r\nin 1066, as well as to the degenerate Frank noblesse and the crushed and\r\nservile Romanesque provincials, from whom, in 912, they had wrested the\r\ndistrict in the north of Gaul which still bears the name of Normandy.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely by extreme valour and ready subordination or military\r\ndiscipline, that the Normans were pre-eminent among all the conquering\r\nraces of the Gothic stock, but also by their instinctive faculty\r\nof appreciating and adopting the superior civilizations which they\r\nencountered. Thus Duke Rollo and his Scandinavian warriors readily\r\nembraced the creed, the language, the laws, and the arts which France,\r\nin those troubled and evil times with which the Capetian dynasty\r\ncommenced, still inherited from imperial Rome and imperial Charlemagne.\r\nThey adopted the customs, the duties, the obedience that the\r\ncapitularies of emperors and kings had established; but that which they\r\nbrought to the application of those laws, was the spirit of life, the\r\nspirit of liberty--the habits also of military subordination, and the\r\naptness for a state politic, which could reconcile the security of all\r\nwith the independence of each. [Sismondi, Histoire des Francais,\r\nvol. iii. p. 174.] So also in all chivalric feelings, in enthusiastic\r\nreligious zeal, in almost idolatrous respect to females of gentle birth,\r\nin generous fondness for the nascent poetry of the time, in a keen\r\nintellectual relish for subtle thought and disputation, in a taste for\r\narchitectural magnificence, and all courtly refinement and pageantry,\r\nthe Normans were the Paladins of the world. Their brilliant qualities\r\nwere sullied by many darker traits of pride, of merciless cruelty, and\r\nof brutal contempt for the industry, the rights, and the feelings of all\r\nwhom they considered the lower classes of mankind.\r\n\r\nTheir gradual blending with the Saxons softened these harsh and evil\r\npoints of their national character, and in return they fired the duller\r\nSaxon mass with a new spirit of animation and power. As Campbell boldly\r\nexpressed it, \"THEY HIGH-METTLED THE BLOOD OF OUR VEINS.\" Small had been\r\nthe figure which England made in the world before the coming over of\r\nthe Normans; and without them she never would have emerged from\r\ninsignificance. The authority of Gibbon may be taken as decisive when he\r\npronounces that, \"Assuredly England was a gainer by the Conquest.\" and\r\nwe may proudly adopt the comment of the Frenchman Rapin, who, writing of\r\nthe battle of Hastings more than a century ago, speaks of the revolution\r\neffected by it, as \"the first step by which England has arrived to that\r\nheight of grandeur and glory we behold it in at present.\" [Rapin, Hist.\r\nEngland, p. 164. See also Sharon Turner, vol. iv. p. 72; and, above all,\r\nPalgrave's Normandy and England.]\r\n\r\nThe interest of this eventful struggle, by which William of Normandy\r\nbecame King of England, is materially enhanced by the high personal\r\ncharacters of the competitors for our crown. They were three in number.\r\nOne was a foreign prince from the North. One was a foreign prince from\r\nthe South: and one was a native hero of the land. Harald Hardrada, the\r\nstrongest and the most chivalric of the kings of Norway, was the first;\r\n[See in Snerre the Saga of Harald Hardrada.] Duke William of Normandy\r\nwas the second; and the Saxon Harold, the son of Earl Godwin, was the\r\nthird. Never was a nobler prize sought by nobler champions, or striven\r\nfor more gallantly. The Saxon triumphed over the Norwegian, and the\r\nNorman triumphed over the Saxon: but Norse valour was never more\r\nconspicuous than when Harald Hardrada and his host fought and fell at\r\nStamford Bridge; nor did Saxons ever face their foes more bravely than\r\nour Harold and his men on the fatal day of Hastings.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of King Edward the Confessor over this land, the claims\r\nof the Norwegian king to our Crown were little thought of; and though\r\nHardrada's predecessor, King Magnus of Norway had on one occasion\r\nasserted that, by virtue of a compact with our former king, Hardicanute,\r\nhe was entitled to the English throne, no serious attempt had been made\r\nto enforce his pretensions. But the rivalry of the Saxon Harold and\r\nthe Norman William was foreseen and bewailed by the Confessor, who was\r\nbelieved to have predicted on his death-bed the calamities that were\r\npending over England. Duke William was King Edward's kinsman. Harold was\r\nthe head of the most powerful noble house, next to the royal blood, in\r\nEngland; and personally, he was the bravest and most popular chieftain\r\nin the land. King Edward was childless, and the nearest collateral heir\r\nwas a puny unpromising boy. England had suffered too severely during\r\nroyal minorities, to make the accession of Edgar Atheling desirable; and\r\nlong before King Edward's death, Earl Harold was the destined king of\r\nthe nation's choice, though the favour of the Confessor was believed to\r\nlean towards the Norman duke.\r\n\r\nA little time before the death of King Edward, Harold was in Normandy.\r\nThe causes of the voyage of the Saxon earl to the continent are\r\ndoubtful; but the fact of his having been, in 1065, at the ducal court,\r\nand in the power of his rival, is indisputable. William made skilful\r\nand unscrupulous use of the opportunity. Though Harold was treated\r\nwith outward courtesy and friendship, he was made fully aware that his\r\nliberty and life depended on his compliance with the Duke's requests.\r\nWilliam said to him, in apparent confidence and cordiality, \"When King\r\nEdward and I once lived like brothers under the same roof, he promised\r\nthat if ever he became King of England, he would make me heir to his\r\nthrone. Harold, I wish that thou wouldst assist me to realize this\r\npromise.\" Harold replied with expressions of assent: and further agreed,\r\nat William's request, to marry William's daughter Adela, and to send\r\nover his own sister to be married to one of William's barons. The crafty\r\nNorman was not content with this extorted promise; he determined to bind\r\nHarold by a more solemn pledge, which if broken, would be a weight on\r\nthe spirit of the gallant Saxon, and a discouragement to others from\r\nadopting his cause. Before a full assembly of the Norman barons, Harold\r\nwas required to do homage to Duke William, as the heir-apparent of the\r\nEnglish crown. Kneeling down, Harold placed his hands between those of\r\nthe Duke, and repeated the solemn form, by which he acknowledged the\r\nDuke as his lord, and promised to him fealty and true service. But\r\nWilliam exacted more. He had caused all the bones and relics of saints,\r\nthat were preserved in the Norman monasteries and churches, to be\r\ncollected into a chest, which was placed in the council-room, covered\r\nover with a cloth of gold. On the chest of relics, which were thus\r\nconcealed, was laid a missal. The Duke then solemnly addressed his\r\ntitular guest and real captive, and said to him, \"Harold, I require\r\nthee, before this noble assembly, to confirm by oath the promises which\r\nthou hast made me, to assist me in obtaining the crown of England after\r\nKing Edward's death, to marry my daughter Adela, and to send me thy\r\nsister, that I may give her in marriage to one of my barons.\" Harold,\r\nonce more taken by surprise, and not able to deny his former words,\r\napproached the missal, and laid his hand on it, not knowing that the\r\nchest of relics was beneath. The old Norman chronicler, who describes\r\nthe scene most minutely, [Wace, Roman de Rou. I have nearly followed his\r\nwords.] says, when Harold placed his hand on it, the hand trembled, and\r\nthe flesh quivered; but he swore, and promised upon his oath, to\r\ntake Ele [Adela] to wife, and to deliver up England to the Duke, and\r\nthereunto to do all in his power, according to his might and wit, after\r\nthe death of Edward, if he himself should live: so help him God. Many\r\ncried, \"God grant it!\" and when Harold rose from his knees, the Duke\r\nmade him stand close to the chest, and took off the pall that had\r\ncovered it, and showed Harold upon what holy relics he had sworn; and\r\nHarold was sorely alarmed at the sight.\r\n\r\nHarold was soon, after this permitted to return to England; and, after a\r\nshort interval, during which he distinguished himself by the wisdom\r\nand humanity with which he pacified some formidable tumults of the\r\nAnglo-Danes in Northumbria, he found himself called on to decide whether\r\nhe would keep the oath which the Norman had obtained from him, or mount\r\nthe vacant throne of England in compliance with the nation's choice.\r\nKing Edward the Confessor died on the 5th of January, 1066, and on the\r\nfollowing day an assembly of the thanes and prelates present in London,\r\nand of the citizens of-the metropolis, declared that Harold should be\r\ntheir king. It was reported that the dying Edward had nominated him as\r\nhis successor; but the sense which his countrymen entertained of his\r\npre-eminent merit was the true foundation of his title to the crown.\r\nHarold resolved to disregard the oath which he made in Normandy, as\r\nviolent and void, and on the 7th day of that January he was anointed\r\nKing of England, and received from the archbishop's hands the golden\r\ncrown and sceptre of England, and also an ancient national symbol, a\r\nweighty battle-axe. He had deep and speedy need of this significant\r\npart of the insignia of Saxon royalty.\r\n\r\nA messenger from Normandy soon arrived to remind Harold of the oath\r\nwhich he had sworn to the Duke \"with his mouth, and his hand upon good\r\nand holy relics.\" \"It is true,\" replied the Saxon king, \"that I took an\r\noath to William; but I took it under constraint: I promised what did\r\nnot belong to me--what I could not in any way hold: my royalty is not my\r\nown; I could not lay it down against the will of the country, nor can I\r\nagainst the will of the country take a foreign wife. As for my sister,\r\nwhom the Duke claims that he may marry her to one of his chiefs, she has\r\ndied within the year; would he have me send her corpse?\"\r\n\r\nWilliam sent another message, which met with a similar answer; and then\r\nthe Duke published far and wide through Christendom what he termed the\r\nperjury and bad faith of his rival; and proclaimed his intention of\r\nasserting his rights by the sword before the year should expire, and\r\nof pursuing and punishing the perjurer even in those places where he\r\nthought he stood most strongly and most securely.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, he commenced hostilities, William, with deep laid\r\npolicy submitted his claims to the decision of the Pope. Harold refused\r\nto acknowledge this tribunal, or to answer before an Italian priest for\r\nhis title as an English king. After a formal examination of William's\r\ncomplaints by the Pope and the cardinals, it was solemnly adjudged at\r\nRome that England belonged to the Norman duke; and a banner was sent to\r\nWilliam from the holy see, which the Pope himself had consecrated and\r\nblessed for the invasion of this island. The clergy throughout the\r\ncontinent were now assiduous and energetic in preaching up William's\r\nenterprise as undertaken in the cause of God. Besides these spiritual\r\narms (the effect of which in the eleventh century must not be measured\r\nby the philosophy or the indifferentism of the nineteenth), the Norman\r\nduke applied all the energies of his mind and body, all the resources of\r\nhis duchy, and all the influence he possessed among vassals or allies,\r\nto the collection of \"the most remarkable and formidable armament which\r\nthe Western nations had witnessed.\" [Sir James Mackintosh's History\r\nof England, vol. i. p. 97.] All the adventurous spirits of Christendom\r\nflocked to the holy banner, under which Duke William, the most renowned\r\nknight and sagest general of the age, promised to lead them to glory\r\nand wealth in the fair domains of England. His army was filled with\r\nthe chivalry of continental Europe, all eager to save their souls by\r\nfighting at the Pope's bidding, ardent to signalise their valour in so\r\ngreat an enterprise, and longing also for the pay and the plunder which\r\nWilliam liberally promised. But the Normans themselves were the pith\r\nand the flower of the army; and William himself was the strongest, the\r\nsagest, and fiercest spirit of them all.\r\n\r\nThroughout the spring and summer of 1066, all the seaports of Normandy,\r\nPicardy, and Brittany rang with the busy sound of preparation. On the\r\nopposite side of the Channel, King Harold collected the army and the\r\nfleet with which he hoped to crush the southern invaders. But the\r\nunexpected attack of King Harald Hardrada of Norway upon another part\r\nof England, disconcerted the skilful measures which the Saxon had taken\r\nagainst the menacing armada of Duke William.\r\n\r\nHarold's renegade brother, Earl Tostig, had excited the Norse king to\r\nthis enterprise, the importance of which has naturally been eclipsed\r\nby the superior interest attached to the victorious expedition of Duke\r\nWilliam, but which was on a scale of grandeur which the Scandinavian\r\nports had rarely, if ever, before witnessed. Hardrada's fleet consisted\r\nof two hundred war-ships, and three hundred other vessels, and all\r\nthe best warriors of Norway were in his host. He sailed first to the\r\nOrkneys, where many of the islanders joined him, and then to Yorkshire.\r\nAfter a severe conflict near York, he completely routed Earls Edwin and\r\nMorcar, the governors of Northumbria. The city of York opened its gates,\r\nand all the country, from the Tyne to the Humber, submitted to him. The\r\ntidings of the defeat of Edwin and Morcar compelled Harold to leave\r\nhis position an the southern coast, and move instantly against the\r\nNorwegians. By a remarkably rapid, march, he reached Yorkshire in\r\nfour days, and took the Norse king and his confederates by surprise.\r\nNevertheless, the battle which ensued, and which was fought near\r\nStamford Bridge, was desperate, and was long doubtful. Unable to break\r\nthe ranks of the Norwegian phalanx by force, Harold at length tempted\r\nthem to quit their close order by a pretended flight. Then the English\r\ncolumns burst in among them, and a carnage ensued, the extent of which\r\nmay be judged of by the exhaustion and inactivity of Norway for a\r\nquarter of a century afterwards. King Harald Hardrada, and all the\r\nflower of his nobility, perished on the 25th of September, 1066, at\r\nStamford Bridge; a battle which was a Flodden to Norway.\r\n\r\nHarold's victory was splendid; but he had bought it dearly by the fall\r\nof many of his best officers and men; and still more dearly by the\r\nopportunity which Duke William had gained of effecting an unopposed\r\nlanding on the Sussex coast. The whole of William's shipping had\r\nassembled at the mouth of the Dive, a little river between the Seine\r\nand the Orme, as early as the middle of August. The army which he had\r\ncollected, amounted to fifty thousand knights, and ten thousand soldiers\r\nof inferior degree. Many of the knights were mounted, but many must have\r\nserved on foot; as it is hardly possible to believe that William could\r\nhave found transports for the conveyance of fifty thousand war-horses\r\nacross the Channel. For a long time the winds were adverse; and the Duke\r\nemployed the interval that passed before he could set sail in completing\r\nthe organization and in improving the discipline of his army; which he\r\nseems to have brought into the same state of perfection, as was seven\r\ncenturies and a half afterwards the boast of another army assembled on\r\nthe same coast, and which Napoleon designed (but providentially in vain)\r\nfor a similar descent upon England.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the approach of the equinox that the wind veered from\r\nthe north-east to the west, and gave the Normans an opportunity of\r\nquitting the weary shores of the Dive. They eagerly embarked, and set\r\nsail; but the wind soon freshened to a gale, and drove them along\r\nthe French coast to St. Valery, where the greater part of them found\r\nshelter; but many of their vessels were wrecked and the whole coast of\r\nNormandy was strewn with the bodies of the drowned. William's army\r\nbegan to grow discouraged and averse to the enterprise, which the very\r\nelements thus seemed to fight against; though in reality the north-east\r\nwind which had cooped them so long at the mouth of the Dive, and the\r\nwestern gale which had forced them into St. Valery, were the best\r\npossible friends to the invaders. They prevented the Normans from\r\ncrossing the Channel until the Saxon king and his army of defence had\r\nbeen called away from the Sussex coast to encounter Harald Hardrada\r\nin Yorkshire: and also until a formidable English fleet, which by\r\nKing Harold's orders had been cruising in the Channel to intercept the\r\nNormans, had been obliged to disperse temporarily for the purpose of\r\nrefitting and taking in fresh stores of provisions.\r\n\r\nDuke William used every expedient to re-animate the drooping spirits\r\nof his men at St. Valery; and at last he caused the body of the patron\r\nsaint of the place to be exhumed and carried in solemn procession, while\r\nthe whole assemblage of soldiers, mariners, and appurtenant priests\r\nimplored the saint's intercession for a change of wind. That very night\r\nthe wind veered, and enabled the mediaeval Agamemnon to quit his Aulia.\r\n\r\nWith full sails, and a following southern breeze, the Norman armada\r\nleft the French shores and steered for England. The invaders crossed an\r\nundefended sea, and found an undefended coast. It was in Pevensey Bay\r\nin Sussex, at Bulverhithe, between the castle of Pevensey and Hastings,\r\nthat the last conquerors of this island landed, on the 29th of\r\nSeptember, 1066.\r\n\r\nHarold was at York, rejoicing over his recent victory, which had\r\ndelivered England from her ancient Scandinavian foes, and resettling the\r\ngovernment of the counties which Harald Hardrada had overrun, when\r\nthe tidings reached him that Duke William of Normandy and his host had\r\nlanded on the Sussex shore. Harold instantly hurried southward to meet\r\nthis long-expected enemy. The severe loss which his army had sustained\r\nin the battle with the Norwegians must have made it impossible for any\r\nlarge number of veteran troops to accompany him in his forced march to\r\nLondon, and thence to Sussex. He halted at the capital only six days;\r\nand during that time gave orders for collecting forces from his southern\r\nand midland counties, and also directed his fleet to reassemble off the\r\nSussex coast. Harold was well received in London, and his summons to\r\narms was promptly obeyed by citizen, by thane, by sokman, and by ceorl;\r\nfor he had shown himself during his brief reign a just and wise king,\r\naffable to all men, active for the good of his country, and (in the\r\nwords of the old historian) sparing himself from no fatigue by land or\r\nsea. [See Roger de Hoveden and William of Malmesbury, cited in Thierry,\r\nbook iii.] He might have gathered a much more numerous force than that\r\nof William, but his recent victory had made, him over-confident, and\r\nhe was irritated by the reports of the country being ravaged by the\r\ninvaders. As soon therefore, as he had collected a small army in London,\r\nhe marched off towards the coast: pressing forward as rapidly as his\r\nmen could traverse Surrey and Sussex in the hope of taking the Normans\r\nunawares, as he had recently by a similar forced march succeeded in\r\nsurprising the Norwegians. But he had now to deal with a foe equally\r\nbrave with Harald Hardrada, and far more skilful and wary.\r\n\r\nThe old Norman chroniclers describe the preparations of William on\r\nhis landing, with a graphic vigour, which would be wholly lost by\r\ntransfusing their racy Norman couplets and terse Latin prose into the\r\ncurrent style of modern history. It is best to follow them closely,\r\nthough at the expense of much quaintness and occasional uncouthness of\r\nexpression. They tell us how Duke William's own ship was the first\r\nof the Norman fleet. \"It was called the Mora, and was the gift of his\r\nduchess, Matilda. On the head of the ship in the front, which mariners\r\ncall the prow, there was a brazen child bearing an arrow with a bended\r\nbow. His face was turned towards England, and thither he looked, as\r\nthough he was about to shoot. The breeze became soft and sweet, and the\r\nsea was smooth for their landing. The ships ran on dry land, and each\r\nranged by the other's side. There you might see the good sailors,\r\nthe sergeants, and squires sally forth and unload the ships; cast the\r\nanchors, haul the ropes, bear out shields and saddles, and land the\r\nwar-horses and palfreys. The archers came forth, and touched land the\r\nfirst, each with his bow strong and with his quiver full of arrows,\r\nslung at his side. All were shaven and shorn; and all clad in short\r\ngarments, ready to attack, to shoot, to wheel about and skirmish. All\r\nstood well equipped, and of good courage for the fight; and they scoured\r\nthe whole shore, but found not an armed man there. After the archers had\r\nthus gone forth, the knights landed all armed, with their hauberks on,\r\ntheir shields slung at their necks, and their helmets laced. They formed\r\ntogether on the shore, each armed, and mounted on his war-horse: all\r\nhad their swords girded on, and rode forward into the country with their\r\nlances raised. Then the carpenters landed, who had great axes in their\r\nhands, and planes and adzes hung at their sides. They took counsel\r\ntogether, and sought for a good spot to place a castle on. They had\r\nbrought with them in the fleet, three wooden castles from Normandy, in\r\npieces, all ready for framing together, and they took the materials of\r\none of these out of the ships, all shaped and pierced to receive the\r\npins which they had brought cut and ready in large barrels; and before\r\nevening had set in, they had finished a good fort on the English ground,\r\nand there they placed their stores. All then ate and drank enough, and\r\nwere right glad that they were ashore.\r\n\r\n\"When Duke William himself landed, as he stepped on the shore, he\r\nslipped and fell forward upon his two hands. Forthwith all raised a loud\r\ncry of distress. 'An evil sign,' said they, 'is here.' But he cried out\r\nlustily, 'See, my lords! by the splendour of God, [William's customary\r\noath.] I have taken possession of England with both my hands. It is now\r\nmine; and what is mine is yours.'\r\n\r\n\"The next day they marched along the sea-shore to Hastings. Near\r\nthat place the Duke fortified a camp, and set up the two other wooden\r\ncastles. The foragers, and those who looked out for booty, seized all\r\nthe clothing and provisions they could find, lest what had been brought\r\nby the ships should fail them. And the English were to be seen fleeing\r\nbefore them, driving off their cattle, and quitting their houses. Many\r\ntook shelter in burying-places, and even there they were in grievous\r\nalarm.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the marauders from the Norman camp, strong bodies of cavalry\r\nwere detached by William into the country, and these, when Harold and\r\nhis army made their rapid march from London southward, fell, back in\r\ngood order upon the main body of the Normans, and reported that the\r\nSaxon king was rushing on like a madman. But Harold, when he found that\r\nhis hopes of surprising his adversary were vain changed his tactics, and\r\nhalted about seven miles from the Norman lines. He sent some spies, who\r\nspoke the French language, to examine the number and preparations of the\r\nenemy, who, on their return, related with astonishment that there were\r\nmore priests in William's camp than there were fighting men in the\r\nEnglish army. They had mistaken for priests all the Norman soldiers\r\nwho had short hair and shaven chins; for the English layman were then\r\naccustomed to wear long hair and mustachios, Harold, who knew the Norman\r\nusages, smiled at their words and said, \"Those whom you have seen in\r\nsuch numbers are not priests, but stout soldiers, as they will soon make\r\nus feel.\"\r\n\r\nHarold's army was far inferior in number to that of the Normans, and\r\nsome of his captains advised him to retreat upon London, and lay waste\r\nthe country, so as to starve down the strength, of the invaders. The\r\npolicy thus recommended was unquestionably the wisest; for the Saxon\r\nfleet had now reassembled, and intercepted all William's communications\r\nwith Normandy; so that as soon as his stores of provisions were\r\nexhausted he must have moved forward upon London; where Harold, at the\r\nhead of the full military strength of the kingdom, could have defied his\r\nassault, and probably might have witnessed his rival's destruction by\r\nfamine and disease, without having to strike a single blow. But Harold's\r\nbold blood was up, and his kindly heart could not endure to inflict\r\non his South Saxon subjects even the temporary misery of wasting the\r\ncountry. \"He would not burn houses and villages, neither would he take\r\naway the substance of his people.\"\r\n\r\nHarold's brothers, Gurth and Leofwine, were with him in the camp, and\r\nGurth endeavoured to persuade him to absent himself from the battle.\r\nThe incident shows how well devised had been William's scheme of binding\r\nHarold by the oath on the holy relics. \"My brother\", said the young\r\nSaxon prince, \"thou canst not deny that either by force or free-will\r\nthou hast made Duke William an oath on the bodies of saints. Why then\r\nrisk thyself in the battle with a perjury upon thee? To us, who have\r\nsworn nothing, this is a holy and a just war, for we are fighting for\r\nour country. Leave us then, alone to fight this battle, and he who has\r\nthe right will win.\" Harold replied that he would not look on while\r\nothers risked their lives for him. Men would hold him a coward, and\r\nblame him for sending his best friends where he dared not go himself. He\r\nresolved, therefore, to fight, and to fight in person: but he was still\r\ntoo good a general to be the assailant in the action. He strengthened\r\nhis position on the hill where he had halted, by a palisade of stakes\r\ninterlaced with osier hurdles, and there, he said, he would defend\r\nhimself against whoever should seek him.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Battle Abbey at this hour attest the place where Harold's\r\narmy was posted. The high altar of the abbey stood on the very spot\r\nwhere Harold's own standard was planted during the fight, and where the\r\ncarnage was the thickest. Immediately after his victory William vowed to\r\nbuild an abbey on the site; and a fair and stately pile soon rose there,\r\nwhere for many ages the monks prayed, and said masses for the souls\r\nof those who were slain in the battle, whence the abbey took its name.\r\nBefore that time the place was called Senlac. Little of the ancient\r\nedifice now remains: but it is easy to trace among its relics and in the\r\nneighbourhood the scenes of the chief incidents in the action; and it\r\nis impossible to deny the generalship shown by Harold in stationing his\r\nmen; especially when we bear in mind that he was deficient in cavalry,\r\nthe arm in which his adversary's main strength consisted.\r\n\r\nA neck of hills trends inwards for nearly seven miles from the high\r\nground immediately to the north-east of Hastings. The line of this neck\r\nof hills is from south-east to north-west, and the usual route from\r\nHastings to London must, in ancient as in modern times, have been along\r\nits summits. At the distance from Hastings which has been mentioned, the\r\ncontinuous chain of hills ceases. A valley must be crossed, and on the\r\nother side of it, opposite to the last of the neck of hills, rises a\r\nhigh ground of some extent, facing to the south-east. This high ground,\r\nthen termed Senlac, was occupied by Harold's army. It could not be\r\nattacked in front without considerable disadvantage to the assailants,\r\nand could hardly be turned without those engaged in the manoeuvre\r\nexposing themselves to a fatal charge in flank, while they wound round\r\nthe base of the height, and underneath the ridges which project from\r\nit on either side. There was a rough and thickly-wooded district in the\r\nrear, which seemed to offer Harold great facilities for rallying his\r\nmen, and checking the progress of the enemy, if they should succeed in\r\nforcing him back from his post. And it seemed scarcely possible that the\r\nNormans, if they met with any repulse, could save themselves from utter\r\ndestruction. With such hopes and expectations (which cannot be termed\r\nunreasonable, though \"Successum Dea dira negavit,\") King Harold bade his\r\nstandard be set up a little way down the slope of Senlac-hill, at the\r\npoint where the ascent from the valley was least steep, and on which the\r\nfiercest attacks of the advancing enemy were sure to be directed.\r\n\r\nThe foundation-stones of the high altar of Battle Abbey have, during\r\nlate years, been discovered; and we may place our feet on the very spot\r\nwhere Harold stood with England's banner waving over him; where, when\r\nthe battle was joined, he defended himself to the utmost; where the\r\nfatal arrow came down on him; where he \"leaned in agony on his shield;\"\r\nand where at last he was beaten to the earth, and with him the Saxon\r\nbanner was beaten down, like him never to rise again. The ruins of\r\nthe altar are a little to the west of the high road, which leads from\r\nHastings along the neck of hills already described, across the valley,\r\nand through the modern town of Battle, towards London. Before a railway\r\nwas made along this valley, some of the old local features were more\r\neasy than now to recognise. The eye then at once saw that the ascent\r\nfrom the valley was least steep at the point which Harold selected\r\nfor his own post in the engagement. But this is still sufficiently\r\ndiscernible; and we can fix the spot, a little lower down the slope,\r\nimmediately in front of the high altar, where the brave Kentish men\r\nstood, \"whose right it was to strike first when ever the king went to\r\nbattle,\" and who, therefore, were placed where the Normans would be most\r\nlikely to make their first charge. Round Harold himself, and where the\r\nplantations wave which now surround the high altar's ruins, stood the\r\nmen of London, \"whose privilege it was to guard the king's body, to\r\nplace themselves around it, and to guard his standard.\" On the right\r\nand left were ranged the other warriors of central and southern\r\nEngland, whose shires the old Norman chronicler distorts in his French\r\nnomenclature. Looking thence in the direction of Hastings, we can\r\ndistinguish the \"ridge of the rising ground over which the Normans\r\nappeared advancing.\" It is the nearest of the neck of hills. It is along\r\nthat hill that Harold and his brothers saw approach in succession the\r\nthree divisions of the Norman army. The Normans came down that slope,\r\nand then formed in the valley, so as to assault the whole front of the\r\nEnglish position. Duke William's own division, with \"the best men and\r\ngreatest strength of the army,\" made the Norman centre, and charged the\r\nEnglish immediately in front of Harold's banner, as the nature of the\r\nground had led the Saxon king to anticipate.\r\n\r\nThere are few battles the localities of which can be more completely\r\ntraced; and the whole scene is fraught with associations of deep\r\ninterest: but the spot which, most of all, awakens our sympathy and\r\nexcites our feelings, is that where Harold himself fought and fell. The\r\ncrumbling fragments of the grey altar-stones, with the wild flowers that\r\ncling around their base, seem fitting memorials of the brave Saxon who\r\nthere bowed his head in death; while the laurel-trees that are planted\r\nnear, and wave over the ruins, remind us of the Conqueror, who there, at\r\nthe close of that dreadful day, reared his victorious standard high over\r\nthe trampled banner of the Saxon, and held his triumphant carousal amid\r\nthe corses of the slain, with his Norman chivalry exulting around him.\r\n\r\nWhen it was known in the invaders' camp at Hastings that King Harold had\r\nmarched southward with his power, but a brief interval ensued before the\r\ntwo hosts met in decisive encounter.\r\n\r\nWilliam's only chance of safety lay in bringing on a general engagement;\r\nand he joyfully advanced his army from their camp on the hill over\r\nHastings, nearer to the Saxon position. But he neglected no means of\r\nweakening his opponent, and renewed his summonses and demands on Harold\r\nwith an ostentatious air of sanctity and moderation.\r\n\r\n\"A monk named Hugues Maigrot came in William's name to call upon the\r\nSaxon king to do one of three things--either to resign his royalty in\r\nfavour of William, or to refer it to the arbitration of the Pope to\r\ndecide which of the two ought to be king, or to let it be determined\r\nby the issue of a single combat. Harold abruptly replied, 'I will not\r\nresign my title, I will not refer it to the Pope, nor will I accept the\r\nsingle combat.' He was far from being deficient in bravery; but he was\r\nno more at liberty to stake the crown which he had received from a whole\r\npeople on the chance of a duel, than to deposit it in the hands of an\r\nItalian priest. William was not at all ruffled by the Saxon's refusal,\r\nbut steadily pursuing the course of his calculated measures, sent the\r\nNorman monk again, after giving him these instructions:--'Go and tell\r\nHarold, that if he will keep his former compact with me, I will leave\r\nto him all the country which is beyond the Humber, and will give his\r\nbrother Gurth all the lands which Godwin held. If he still persist in\r\nrefusing my offers, then thou shalt tell him, before all his people,\r\nthat he is a perjurer and a liar; that he, and all who shall support\r\nhim, are excommunicated by the mouth of the Pope; and that the bull to\r\nthat effect is in my hands.'\r\n\r\n\"Hugues Maigrot delivered this message in a solemn tone; and the Norman\r\nchronicle says that at the word EXCOMMUNICATION, the English chiefs\r\nlooked at one another as if some great danger were impending. One of\r\nthem then spoke as follows: 'We must fight, whatever may be the danger\r\nto us; for what we have to consider is not whether we shall accept\r\nand receive a new lord as if our king were dead: the case is quite\r\notherwise. The Norman has given our lands to his captains, to his\r\nknights, to all his people, the greater part of whom have already done\r\nhomage to him for them; they will all look for their gift, if their\r\nDuke become our king; and he himself is bound to deliver up to them our\r\ngoods, our wives, and our daughters: all is promised to them beforehand.\r\nThey come, not only to ruin us, but to ruin our descendants also, and to\r\ntake from us the country of our ancestors and what shall we do--whither\r\nshall we go--when we have no longer a country?' The English promised by\r\na unanimous oath, to make neither peace, nor truce nor treaty, with the\r\ninvader, but to die, or drive away the Normans.\" [Thierry.]\r\n\r\nThe 13th of October was occupied in these negotiations; and at night the\r\nDuke announced to his men that the next day would, be the day of\r\nbattle. That night is said to have been passed by the two armies in very\r\ndifferent manners. The Saxon soldiers spent it in joviality, singing\r\ntheir national songs, and draining huge horns of ale and wine round\r\ntheir camp-fires. The Normans, when they had looked to their arms and\r\nhorses, confessed themselves to the priests, with whom their camp was\r\nthronged, and received the sacrament by thousands at a time.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 14th of October, was fought the great battle.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to compose a narrative of its principal incidents,\r\nfrom the historical information which we possess, especially if aided\r\nby an examination of the ground. But it is far better to adopt the\r\nspirit-stirring words of the old chroniclers, who wrote while the\r\nrecollections of the battle were yet fresh, and while the feelings and\r\nprejudices of the combatants yet glowed in the bosoms of their near\r\ndescendants. Robert Wace, the Norman poet, who presented his \"Roman de\r\nRou\" to our Henry II., is the most picturesque and animated of the old\r\nwriters; and from him we can obtain a more vivid and full description of\r\nthe conflict, than even the most brilliant romance-writer of the present\r\ntime can supply. We have also an antique memorial of the battle, more to\r\nbe relied on than either chronicler or poet (and which confirms\r\nWace's narrative remarkably), in the celebrated Bayeux tapestry, which\r\nrepresents the principal scenes of Duke William's expedition, and of the\r\ncircumstances connected with it, in minute though occasionally grotesque\r\ndetails, and which was undoubtedly the production of the same age in\r\nwhich the battle took place; whether we admit or reject the legend that\r\nQueen Matilda and the ladies of her court wrought it with their own\r\nhands in honour of the royal Conqueror.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore suffer the old Norman chronicler to transport our\r\nimaginations to the fair Sussex scenery, north-west of Hastings, with\r\nits breezy uplands, its grassy slopes, and ridges of open down swelling\r\ninland from the sparkling sea, its scattered copses, and its denser\r\nglades of intervening forests, clad in all the varied tints of autumn,\r\nas they appeared on the morning of the fourteenth of October, seven\r\nhundred and eighty-five years ago. The Norman host is pouring forth\r\nfrom its tents; and each troop, and each company, is forming fast under\r\nthe banner of its leader. The masses have been sung, which were finished\r\nbetimes in the morning; the barons have all assembled round Duke\r\nWilliam; and the Duke has ordered that the army shall be formed in three\r\ndivisions, so as to make the attack upon the Saxon position in three\r\nplaces. The Duke stood on a hill where he could best see his men; the\r\nbarons surrounded him, and he spake to them proudly. He told them how he\r\ntrusted them, and how all that he gained should be theirs; and how sure\r\nhe felt of conquest, for in all the world there was not so brave an army\r\nor such good men and true as were then forming around him. Then they\r\ncheered him in turn, and cried out, \"'You will not see one coward; none\r\nhere will fear to die for love of you, if need be.' And he answered\r\nthem, 'I thank you well. For God's sake spare not; strike hard at the\r\nbeginning; stay not to take spoil; all the booty shall be in common,\r\nand there will be plenty for everyone. There will be no safety in asking\r\nquarter or in fight: the English will never love or spare a Norman.\r\nFelons they were, and felons they are; false they were, and false they\r\nwill be. Show no weakness towards them, for they will have no pity on\r\nyou. Neither the coward for running well, nor the bold man for smiting\r\nwell, will be the better liked by the English, nor will any be the more\r\nspared on either account. You may fly to the sea, but you can fly no\r\nfurther; you will find neither ships nor bridge there; there will be no\r\nsailors to receive you; and the English will overtake you there and slay\r\nyou in your shame. More of you will die in flight than in the battle.\r\nThen, as flight will not secure you, fight, and you will conquer. I have\r\nno doubt of the victory: we are come for glory, the victory is in our\r\nhands, and we may make sure of obtaining it if we so please.' As the\r\nDuke was speaking thus, and would yet have spoken more, William Fitz\r\nOsber rode up with his horse all coated with iron: 'Sire,' said he, 'we\r\ntarry here too long, let us all arm ourselves. ALLONS! ALLONS!'\r\n\r\n\"Then all went to their tents and armed themselves as they best might;\r\nand the Duke was very busy, giving every one his orders; and he was\r\ncourteous to all the vassals, giving away many arms and horses to them.\r\nWhen he prepared to arm himself, he called first for his good hauberk,\r\nand a man brought it on his arm, and placed it before him, but in\r\nputting his head in, to get it on, he unawares turned it the wrong way,\r\nwith the back part in front. He soon changed it, but when he saw that\r\nthose who stood by were sorely alarmed, he said, 'I have seen many a man\r\nwho, if such a thing had happened to him, would not have borne arms,\r\nor entered the field the same day; but I never believed in omens, and I\r\nnever will. I trust in God, for He does in all things His pleasure, and\r\nordains what is to come to pass, according to His will. I have never\r\nliked fortune-tellers, nor believed in diviners; but I commend myself to\r\nour Lady. Let not this mischance give you trouble. The hauberk which\r\nwas turned wrong, and then set right by me, signifies that a change will\r\narise out of the matter which we are now stirring. You shall see the\r\nname of duke changed into king. Yea, a king shall I be, who hitherto\r\nhave been but duke.' Then he crossed himself and straightway took his\r\nhauberk, stooped his head, and put it on aright, and laced his helmet,\r\nand girt on his sword, which a varlet brought him. Then the Duke called\r\nfor his good horse--a better could not be found. It had been sent him\r\nby a king of Spain, out of very great friendship. Neither arms nor the\r\npress of fighting men did it fear, if its lord spurred it on. Walter\r\nGiffard brought it. The Duke stretched out his hand, took the reins, put\r\nfoot in stirrup, and mounted; and the good horse pawed, pranced, reared\r\nhimself up, and curvetted. The Viscount of Toarz saw how the Duke bore\r\nhimself in arms, and said to his people that were around him, 'Never\r\nhave I seen a man so fairly armed, nor one who rods so gallantly, or\r\nbore his arms or became his hauberk so well; neither any one who bore\r\nhis lance so gracefully, or sat his horse and managed him so nobly.\r\nThere is no such knight under heaven! a fair count he is, and fair king\r\nhe will be. Let him fight, and he shall overcome: shame be to the man\r\nwho shall fail him.'\r\n\r\n\"Then the Duke called for the standard which the Pope had sent him, and\r\nhe who bore it having unfolded it, the Duke took it, and, called to Raol\r\nde Conches. 'Bear my standard,' said he, 'for I would not but do you\r\nright; by right and by ancestry your line are standard-bearers of\r\nNormandy, and very good knights have they all been.' But Raol said that\r\nhe would serve the Duke that day in other guise, and would fight the\r\nEnglish with his hand as long as life should last. Then the Duke bade\r\nGaltier Giffart bear the standard. But he was old and white-headed,\r\nand bade the Duke give the standard to some younger and stronger man to\r\ncarry. Then the Duke said fiercely, 'By the splendour of God, my lords,\r\nI think you mean to betray and fail me in this great need.'--'Sire,'\r\nsaid Giffart, 'not so! we have done no treason, nor do I refuse from any\r\nfelony towards you; but I have to lead a great chivalry, both hired men\r\nand the men of my fief. Never had I such good means of serving you as\r\nI now have; and if God please, I will serve you; if need be, I will die\r\nfor you, and will give my own heart for yours.\r\n\r\n\"'By my faith,' quoth the Duke, 'I always loved thee, and now I love\r\nthee more; if I survive this day, thou shalt be the better for it all\r\nthy days.' Then he called out a knight, whom he had heard much praised,\r\nTosteins Fitz-Rou le Blanc by name, whose abode was at Bec-en-Caux. To\r\nhim he delivered the standard; and Tosteins took it right cheerfully,\r\nand bowed low to him in thanks, and bore it gallantly, and with good\r\nheart. His kindred still have quittance of all service for their\r\ninheritance on that account, and their heirs are entitled so to hold\r\ntheir inheritance for ever.\r\n\r\n\"William sat on his war-horse, and called on Rogier, whom they call De\r\nMongomeri. 'I rely much upon you,' said he: 'lead your men thitherward,\r\nand attack them from that side. William, the son of Osber the seneschal,\r\na right good vassal, shall go with you and help in the attack, and you\r\nshall have the men of Boulogne and Poix, and all my soldiers. Alain\r\nFergert and Ameri shall attack on the other side; they shall lead the\r\nPoitevins and the Bretons, and all the Barons of Maine; and I, with my\r\nown great men, my friends and kindred, will fight in the middle throng,\r\nwhere the battle shall be the hottest.'\r\n\r\n\"The barons, and knights, and men-at-arms were all now armed; the\r\nfoot-soldiers were well equipped, each bearing bow and sword; on their\r\nheads were caps, and to their feet were bound buskins. Some had good\r\nhides which they had bound round their bodies; and many were clad in\r\nfrocks, and had quivers and bows hung to their girdles. The knights\r\nhad hauberks and swords, boots of steel and shining helmets; shields at\r\ntheir necks, and in their hands lances. And all had their cognizances,\r\nso that each might know his fellow, and Norman might not strike Norman,\r\nnor Frenchman kill his countryman by mistake. Those on foot led the\r\nway, with serried ranks, bearing their bows. The knights rode next,\r\nsupporting the archers from behind. Thus both horse and foot kept their\r\ncourse and order of march as they began; in close ranks at a gentle\r\npace, that the one might not pass or separate from the other. All went\r\nfirmly and compactly, bearing themselves gallantly.\r\n\r\n\"Harold had summoned his men, earls, barons, and vavassours, from, the\r\ncastles and the cities; from the ports, the villages, and boroughs. The\r\npeasants were also called together from the villages, bearing such arms\r\nas they found; clubs and great picks, iron forge and stages. The English\r\nhad enclosed the place where Harold was, with his friends and the barons\r\nof the country whom he had summoned and called together.\r\n\r\n\"Those of London had come at once, and those of Kent, Hartfort, and of\r\nEssesse; those of Suree and Susesse, of St. Edmund and Sufoc; of Norwis\r\nand Norfoc; of Cantorbierre and Stanfort Bedefort and Hundetone. The men\r\nof Northanton also came; and those of Eurowic and Bokingkeham, of Bed\r\nand Notinkeham, Lindesie and Nichole. There came also from the west\r\nall, who heard the summons; and very many were to be seen coming from\r\nSalebiere and Dorset, from Bat and from Somerset. Many came, too, from\r\nabout Glocestre, and many from Wirecestre, from Wincestre, Hontesire,\r\nand Brichesire; and many more from other counties that we have not\r\nnamed, and cannot indeed recount. All who could bear arms, and had\r\nlearnt the news of the Duke's arrival, came to defend the land. But none\r\ncame from beyond Humbre, for they had other business upon their hands;\r\nthe Danes and Tosti having much damaged and weakened them.\r\n\r\n\"Harold knew that the Normans would come and attack him hand to hand; so\r\nhe had early enclosed the field in which he placed his men. He made them\r\narm early, and range themselves for the battle; he himself having put on\r\narms and equipments that became such a lord. The Duke, he said, ought\r\nto seek him, as he wanted to conquer England; and it became him to abide\r\nthe attack who had to defend the land. He commanded the people,\r\nand counselled his barons to keep themselves altogether, and defend\r\nthemselves in a body; for if they once separated, they would with\r\ndifficulty recover themselves. 'The Normans,' he said, 'are good\r\nvassals, valiant on foot and on horseback; good knights are they on\r\nhorseback, and well used to battle; all is lost if they once penetrate\r\nour ranks. They have brought long lances and swords, but you have\r\npointed lances and keen-edged bills; and I do not expect that their arms\r\ncan stand against yours. Cleave wherever you can; it will be ill done if\r\nyou spare aught.'\r\n\r\n\"The English had built up a fence before them with their shields, and\r\nwith ash and other wood; and had well joined and wattled in the whole\r\nwork, so as not to leave even a crevice; and thus they had a barricade\r\nin their front, through which any Norman who would attack them must\r\nfirst pass. Being covered in this way by their shields and barricades,\r\ntheir aim was to defend themselves: and if they had remained steady for\r\nthat purpose, they would not have been conquered that day; for every\r\nNorman who made his way in, lost his life, either by hatchet, or bill,\r\nby club, or other weapons. They wore short and close hauberks, and\r\nhelmets that hung over their garments. King Harold issued orders and\r\nmade proclamation round, that all should be ranged with their faces\r\ntowards the enemy; and that no one should move from where he was; so\r\nthat, whoever came, might find them ready; and that whatever any one, be\r\nhe Norman or other, should do, each should do his best to defend his\r\nown place. Then he ordered the men of Kent to go where the Normans\r\nwere likely to make the attack; for they say that the men of Kent are\r\nentitled to strike first; and that whenever the king goes to battle, the\r\nfirst blow belongs to them. The right of the men of London is to guard\r\nthe king's body, to place themselves around him, and to guard his\r\nstandard; and they were accordingly placed by the standard to watch and\r\ndefend it.\r\n\r\n\"When Harold had made his reply, and given his orders, he came into\r\nthe midst of the English, and dismounted by the side of the standard:\r\nLeofwin and Gurth, his brothers, were with him, and around him he had\r\nbarons enough, as he stood by his standard, which was in truth a noble\r\none, sparkling with gold and precious stones. After the victory, William\r\nsent it to the Pope, to prove and commemorate his great conquest and\r\nglory. The English stood in close ranks, ready and eager for the fight;\r\nand they moreover made a fosse, which went across the field, guarding\r\none side of their army,\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile the Normans appeared advancing over the ridge of a rising\r\nground; and the first division of their troops moved onwards along the\r\nhill and across a vallley. And presently another division, still larger,\r\ncame in sight, close following upon the first, and they were led towards\r\nanother part of the field, forming together as the first body had done.\r\nAnd while Harold saw and examined them, and was pointing them out to\r\nGurth, a fresh company came in sight, covering all the plain; and in the\r\nmidst of them was raised the standard that came from Rome. Near it was\r\nthe Duke, and the best men and greatest strength of the army were there.\r\nThe good knights, the good vassals, and brave warriors were there; and\r\nthere were gathered together the gentle barons, the good archers,\r\nand the men-at-arms, whose duty it was to guard the Duke, and range\r\nthemselves around him. The youths and common herd of the camp, whose\r\nbusiness was not to join in the battle, but to take care of the harness\r\nand stores, moved on towards a rising ground. The priests and the clerks\r\nalso ascended a hill, there to offer up prayers to God, and watch the\r\nevent of the battle.\r\n\r\n\"The English stood firm on foot in close ranks, and carried themselves\r\nright boldly. Each man had his hauberk on, with his sword girt, and his\r\nshield at his neck. Great hatchets were also slung at their necks, with\r\nwhich they expected to strike heavy blows.\r\n\r\n\"The Normans brought on the three divisions of their army to attack\r\nat different places. They set out in three companies, and in three\r\ncompanies did they fight. The first and second had come up, and then\r\nadvanced the third, which was the greatest; with that came the Duke with\r\nhis own men, and all moved boldly forward.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the two armies were in full view of each other, great noise\r\nand tumult arose. You might hear the sound of many trumpets, of bugles,\r\nand of horns: and then you might see men ranging themselves in line,\r\nlifting their shields, raising their lances, bending their bows,\r\nhandling their arrows, ready for assault and defence.\r\n\r\n\"The English stood ready to their post, the Normans still moved on; and\r\nwhen they drew near, the English were to be seen stirring to and fro;\r\nwere going and coming; troops ranging themselves in order; some with\r\ntheir colour rising, others turning pale; some making ready their arms,\r\nothers raising their shields; the brave man rousing himself to fight,\r\nthe coward trembling at the approach of danger.\r\n\r\n\"Then Taillefer, who sang right well, rode mounted on a swift horse,\r\nbefore the Duke, singing of Charlemagne and of Roland, of Olivier and\r\nthe Peers who died in Roncesvalles, and when they drew nigh to the\r\nEnglish, 'A boon, sire!' cried Taillefer; 'I have long served you, and\r\nyou owe me for all such service. To-day, so please you, you shall repay\r\nit. I ask as my guerdon, and beseech you for it earnestly, that you will\r\nallow me to strike the first blow in the battle!' And the Duke answered,\r\n'I grant it.' Then Taillefer put his horse to a gallop, charging before\r\nall the rest, and struck an Englishman dead, driving his lance below the\r\nbreast into his body, and stretching him upon the ground. Then he drew\r\nhis sword, and struck another, crying out, 'Come on, come on! What do\r\nye, sirs! lay on, lay on!' At the second blow he struck, the English\r\npushed forward, and surrounded and slew him. Forthwith arose the noise\r\nand cry of war, and on either side the people put themselves in motion.\r\n\r\n\"The Normans moved on to the assault, and the English defended\r\nthemselves well. Some were striking, others urging onwards; all were\r\nbold, and cast aside fear. And now, behold, that battle was gathered,\r\nwhereof the fame is yet mighty.\r\n\r\n\"Loud and far resounded the bray of the horns; and the shocks of the\r\nlances, the mighty strokes of maces, and the quick clashing of swords.\r\nOne while the Englishmen rushed on, another while they fell back; one\r\nwhile the men from over the sea charged onwards, and again at other\r\ntimes retreated. The Normans shouted 'Dex aie,' the English people\r\n'Out.' Then came the cunning manoeuvres, the rude shocks and strokes\r\nof the lance and blows of the swords, among the sergeants and soldiers,\r\nboth English and Norman.\r\n\r\n\"When the English fall, the Normans shout. Each side taunts and defies\r\nthe other, yet neither knoweth what the other saith; and the Normans say\r\nthe English bark, because they understand not their speech.\r\n\r\n\"Some wax strong, others weak: the brave exult, but the cowards tremble,\r\nas men who are sore dismayed. The Normans press on the assault, and the\r\nEnglish defend their post well: they pierce the hauberks, and cleave the\r\nshields, receive and return mighty blows. Again, some press forwards,\r\nothers yield; and thus in various ways the struggle proceeds. In the\r\nplain was a fosse, which the Normans had now behind them, having passed\r\nit in the fight without regarding it. But the English charged, and drove\r\nthe Normans before them till they made them fall back upon this fosse,\r\noverthrowing into it horses and men. Many were to be seen falling\r\ntherein, rolling one over the other, with their faces to the earth, and\r\nunable to rise. Many of the English, also, whom the Normans drew down\r\nalong with them, died there. At no time during the day's battle did so\r\nmany Normans die as perished in that fosse. So those said who saw the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n\"The varlets who were set to guard the harness began to abandon it as\r\nthey saw the loss of the Frenchmen, when thrown back upon the fosse\r\nwithout power to recover themselves. Being greatly alarmed at seeing\r\nthe difficulty in restoring order, they began to quit the harness, and\r\nsought around, not knowing where to find shelter. Then Duke William's\r\nbrother, Odo, the good priest, the Bishop of Bayeux, galloped up, and\r\nsaid to them, 'Stand fast! stand fast! be quiet and move not! fear\r\nnothing, for if God please, we shall conquer yet.' So they took courage,\r\nand rested where they were; and Odo returned galloping back to where the\r\nbattle was most fierce, and was of great service on that day. He had put\r\nhauberk on, over a white aube, wide in the body, with the sleeve tight;\r\nand sat on a white horse, so that all might recognise him. In his hand\r\nhe held a mace, and wherever he saw most need he held up and stationed\r\nthe knights, and often urged them on to assault and strike the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"From nine o'clock in the morning, when the combat began, till three\r\no'clock came, the battle was up and down, this way and that, and no one\r\nknew who would conquer and win the land. Both sides stood so firm and\r\nfought so well, that no one could guess which would prevail. The Norman\r\narchers with their bows shot thickly upon the English; but they covered\r\nthemselves with their shields, so that the arrows could not reach their\r\nbodies, nor do any mischief, how true soever was their aim, or however\r\nwell they shot. Then the Normans determined to shoot their arrows\r\nupwards into the air, so that they might fall on their enemies' heads,\r\nand strike their faces. The archers adopted this scheme, and shot up\r\ninto the air towards the English; and the arrows in falling struck their\r\nheads and faces, and put out the eyes of many; and all feared to open\r\ntheir eyes, or leave their faces unguarded.\r\n\r\n\"The arrows now flew thicker than rain before the wind; fast sped the\r\nshafts that the English called 'wibetes.' Then it was that an arrow,\r\nthat had been thus shot upwards, struck Harold above his right eye and\r\nput it out. In his agony he drew the arrow and threw it away, breaking\r\nit with his hands; and the pain to his head was so great, that he leaned\r\nupon his shield. So the English were wont to say, and still say to the\r\nFrench, that the arrow was well shot which was so sent up against\r\ntheir king; and that the archer won them great glory, who thus put out\r\nHarold's eye.\r\n\r\n\"The Normans saw that the English defended themselves well, and were so\r\nstrong in their position that they could do little against them. So they\r\nconsulted together privily, and arranged to draw off, and pretend to\r\nflee, till the English should pursue and scatter themselves over the\r\nfield; for they saw that if they could once get their enemies to break:\r\ntheir ranks, they might be attacked and discomfited much more easily. As\r\nthey had said, so they did. The Normans by little and little fled, the\r\nEnglish following them. As the one fell back, the other pressed after;\r\nand when the Frenchmen retreated, the English thought and cried out that\r\nthe men of France fled, and would never return.\r\n\r\n\"Thus they were deceived by the pretended flight, and great mischief\r\nthereby befell them; for if they had not moved from their position, it\r\nis not likely that they would have been conquered at all; but like fools\r\nthey broke their lines and pursued.\r\n\r\n\"The Normans were to be seen following up their stratagem, retreating\r\nslowly so as to draw the English further on. As they still flee, the\r\nEnglish pursue; they push out their lances and stretch forth their\r\nhatchets: following the Normans, as they go rejoicing in the success of\r\ntheir scheme, and scattering themselves over the plain. And the English\r\nmeantime jeered and insulted their foes with words. 'Cowards,' they\r\ncried, 'you came hither in an evil hour, wanting our lands, and seeking\r\nto seize our property, fools that ye were to come! Normandy is too far\r\noff and you will not easily reach it. It is of little use to run back;\r\nunless you can cross the sea at a leap, or can drink it dry, your sons\r\nand daughters are lost to you.\r\n\r\n\"The Normans bore it all, but in fact they knew not what the English\r\nsaid: their language seemed like the baying of dogs, which they could\r\nnot understand. At length they stopped and turned round, determined to\r\nrecover their ranks; and the barons might be heard crying 'Dex aie!' for\r\na halt. Then the Normans resumed their former position, turning their\r\nfaces towards the enemy; and their men were to be seen facing round and\r\nrushing onwards to a fresh MELEE; the one party assaulting the other;\r\nthis man striking, another pressing onwards. One hits, another misses;\r\none flies, another pursues; one is aiming a stroke, while another\r\ndischarges his blow. Norman strives with Englishman again, and aims his\r\nblows afresh. One flies, another pursues swiftly: the combatants are\r\nmany, the plain wide, the battle and the MELEE fierce. On every hand\r\nthey fight hard, the blows are heavy, and the struggle becomes fierce.\r\n\r\n\"The Normans were playing their part well, when an English knight came\r\nrushing up, having in his company a hundred men, furnished with various\r\narms. He wielded a northern hatchet, with the blade a full foot long;\r\nand was well armed after his manner, being tall, bold, and of noble\r\ncarriage. In the front of the battle where the Normans thronged most, he\r\ncame bounding on swifter than the stag, many Normans falling before\r\nhim and his company. He rushed straight upon a Norman who was armed and\r\nriding on a war-horse, and tried with, his hatchet of steel to cleave\r\nhis helmet; but the blow miscarried and the sharp blade glanced down\r\nbefore the saddle-bow, driving through the horse's neck down to the\r\nground, so that both horse and master fell together to the earth. I know\r\nnot whether the Englishman struck another blow; but the Normans who saw\r\nthe stroke were astonished and about to abandon the assault, when Roger\r\nde Mongomeri came galloping up, with his lance set, and heeding not the\r\nlong-handled axe, which the English-man wielded aloft, struck him\r\ndown, and left him stretched upon the ground. Then Roger cried out,\r\n'Frenchmen, strike! the day is ours!' and again a fierce MELEE was to be\r\nseen, with many a blow of lance and sword; the English still defending\r\nthemselves, killing the horses and cleaving the shields.\r\n\r\n\"There was a French soldier of noble mien, who sat his horse gallantly.\r\nHe spied two Englishmen who were also carrying themselves boldly. They\r\nwere both men of great worth, and had become companions in arms and\r\nfought together, the one protecting the other. They bore two long and\r\nbroad bills, and did great mischief to the Normans, killing both horses\r\nand men. The French soldier looked at them and their bills, and was sore\r\nalarmed, for he was afraid of losing his good horse, the best that he\r\nhad; and would willingly have turned to some other quarter, if it would\r\nnot have looked like cowardice. He soon, however, recovered his courage,\r\nand spurring his horse gave him the bridle, and galloped swiftly\r\nforward. Fearing the two bills, he raised his shield, and struck one of\r\nthe Englishmen with his lance on the breast, so that the iron passed\r\nout at his back; at the moment that he fell the lance broke, and the\r\nFrenchmen seized the mace that hung at his right side, and struck the\r\nother Englishman a blow that completely broke his skull.\r\n\r\n\"On the other side was an Englishman who much annoyed the French,\r\ncontinually assaulting them with a keen-edged hatchet. He had a helmet\r\nmade of wood, which he had fastened down to his coat, and laced round\r\nhis neck, so that no blows could reach his head. The ravage he was\r\nmaking was seen by a gallant Norman knight, who rode a horse that\r\nneither fire nor water could stop in its career, when its master urged\r\nit on. The knight spurred, and his horse carried him on well till he\r\ncharged the Englishman, striking him over the helmet, so that it fell\r\ndown over his eyes; and as he stretched out his hand to raise it and\r\nuncover the face, the Norman cut off his right hand, so that his hatchet\r\nfell to the ground. Another Norman sprang forward and eagerly seized the\r\nprize with both his hands, but he kept it little space, and paid dearly\r\nfor it, for as he stooped to pick up the hatchet, an Englishman with his\r\nlong-handled axe struck him over the back, breaking all his bones, so\r\nthat his entrails and lungs gushed forth. The knight of the good\r\nhorse meantime returned without injury; but on his way he met another\r\nEnglishman, and bore him down under his his horse, wounding him\r\ngrievously, and trampling him altogether under foot.\r\n\r\n\"And now might be heard the loud clang and cry of battle, and the\r\nclashing of lances. The English stood firm in their barricades, and\r\nshivered the lances, beating them into pieces with their bills and\r\nmaces. The Normans drew their swords, and hewed down the barricades, and\r\nthe English in great trouble fell back upon their standard, where were\r\ncollected the maimed and wounded.\r\n\r\n\"There were many knights of Chauz, who jousted and made attacks. The\r\nEnglish knew not how to joust, or bear arms on horseback but fought with\r\nhatchets and bills. A man when he wanted to strike with one of their\r\nhatchets, was obliged to hold it with both his hands, and could not at\r\nthe same time, as it seems to me, both cover himself and strike with any\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n\"The English fell back towards the standard, which was upon a rising\r\nground, and the Normans followed them across the valley, attacking them\r\non foot and horseback. Then Hue de Mortemer, with the sires D'Auviler,\r\nD'Onebac, and St. Cler, rode up and charged, overthrowing many.\r\n\r\n\"Robert Fitz Erneis fixed his lance, took his shield, and, galloping\r\ntowards the standard, with his keen-edged sword struck an Englishman who\r\nwas in front, killed him, and then drawing back his sword, attacked many\r\nothers, and pushed straight for the standard, trying to beat it down,\r\nbut the English surrounded it, and killed him with their bills. He was\r\nfound on the spot, when they afterwards sought for him, dead, and lying\r\nat the standard's foot.\r\n\r\n\"Duke William pressed close upon the English with his lance; striving\r\nhard to reach the standard with the great troop he led; and seeking\r\nearnestly for Harold, on whose account the whole war was. The Normans\r\nfollow their lord, and press around him; they ply their blows upon the\r\nEnglish; and these defend themselves stoutly, striving hard with their\r\nenemies, returning blow for blow.\r\n\r\n\"One of them was a man of great strength, a wrestler, who did great\r\nmischief to the Normans with his hatchet; all feared him, for he struck\r\ndown a great many Normans. The Duke spurred on his horse, and aimed a\r\nblow at him, but he stooped, and so escaped the stroke; then jumping on\r\none side, he lifted his hatchet aloft, and as the Duke bent to avoid\r\nthe blow the Englishman boldly struck him on the head, and beat in his\r\nhelmet, though without doing much injury. He was very near falling,\r\nhowever, but bearing on his stirrups he recovered himself immediately;\r\nand when he thought to have revenged himself upon the churl by killing\r\nhim, he had escaped, dreading the Duke's blow. He ran back in among the\r\nEnglish, but he was not safe even there; for the Normans seeing him,\r\npursued and caught him; and having pierced him through and through with\r\ntheir lances, left him dead on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Where the throng of the battle was greatest, the men of Kent and Essex\r\nfought wondrously well, and made the Normans again retreat, but without\r\ndoing them much injury. And when the Duke saw his men fall back and the\r\nEnglish triumphing over them, his spirit rose high, and he seized his\r\nshield and his lance, which a vassal handed to him, and took his post by\r\nhis standard.\r\n\r\n\"Then those who kept close guard by him and rode where he rode, being\r\nabout a thousand armed men, came and rushed with closed ranks upon the\r\nEnglish; and with the weight of their good horses, and the blows the\r\nknights gave, broke the press of the enemy, and scattered the crowd\r\nbefore them, the good Duke leading them on in front. Many pursued and\r\nmany fled; many were the Englishmen who fell around, and were trampled\r\nunder the horses, crawling upon the earth, and not able to rise. Many\r\nof the richest and noblest men fell in that rout, but the English still\r\nrallied in places; smote down those whom they reached, and maintained\r\nthe combat the best they could; beating down the men and killing the\r\nhorses. One Englishman watched the Duke, and plotted to kill him; he\r\nwould have struck him with his lance, but he could not, for the Duke\r\nstruck him first, and felled him to the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Loud was now the clamour, and great the slaughter; many a soul then\r\nquitted the body it inhabited. The living marched over the heaps of\r\ndead, and each side was weary of striking. He charged on who could, and\r\nhe who could no longer strike still pushed forward. The strong struggled\r\nwith the strong; some failed, others triumphed; the cowards fell back,\r\nthe brave pressed on; and sad was his fate who fell in the midst, for\r\nhe had little chance of rising again; and many in truth fell, who never\r\nrose at all, being crushed under the throng.\r\n\r\n\"And now the Normans pressed on so far, that at last they had reached\r\nthe standard. There Harold had remained, defending himself to the\r\nutmost; but he was sorely wounded in his eye by the arrow, and suffered\r\ngrievous pain from the blow. An armed man came in the throng of the\r\nbattle, and struck him on the ventaille of his helmet, and beat him to\r\nthe ground; and as he sought to recover himself, a knight beat him down\r\nagain, striking him on the thick of his thigh, down to the bone.\r\n\r\n\"Gurth saw the English falling around, and that there was no remedy. He\r\nsaw his race hastening to ruin, and despaired of any aid; he would have\r\nfled but could not, for the throng continually increased and the Duke\r\npushed on till he reached him, and struck him with great force. Whether\r\nhe died of that blow I know not, but it was said that he fell under it,\r\nand rose no more.\r\n\r\n\"The standard was beaten down, the golden standard was taken, and Harold\r\nand the best of his friends were slain; but there was so much eagerness,\r\nand throng of so many around, seeking to kill him, that I know not who\r\nit was that slew him.\r\n\r\n\"The English were in great trouble at having lost their king, and at\r\nthe Duke's having conquered and beat down the standard; but they still\r\nfought on, and defended themselves long, and in fact till the day drew\r\nto a close. Then it clearly appeared to all that the standard was lost,\r\nand the news had spread throughout the army that Harold for certain was\r\ndead; and all saw that there was no longer any hope, so they left the\r\nfield, and those fled who could.\r\n\r\n\"William fought well; many an assault did he lead, many a blow did he\r\ngive, and many receive, and many fell dead under his hand. Two horses\r\nwere killed under him, and he took a third at time of need, so that he\r\nfell not to the ground; and he lost not a drop of blood. But whatever\r\nany one did, and whoever lived or died, this is certain, that William\r\nconquered, and that many of the English fled from the field, and many\r\ndied on the spot. Then he returned thanks to God, and in his pride\r\nordered his standard to be brought and set up on high where the English\r\nstandard had stood; and that was the signal of his having conquered and\r\nbeaten down the foe. And he ordered his tent to be raised on the\r\nspot among the dead, and had his meat brought thither, and his supper\r\nprepared there.\r\n\r\n\"Then he took off his armour; and the barons and knights, pages and\r\nsquires came, when he had unstrung his shield: and they took the helmet\r\nfrom his head, and the hauberk from his back, and saw the heavy blows\r\nupon his shield, and how his helmet was dinted in. And all greatly\r\nwondered, and said, 'Such a baron never bestrode war-horse, or dealt\r\nsuch blows, or did such feats of arms; neither has there been on earth\r\nsuch a knight since Rollant and Olivier.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus they lauded and extolled him greatly, and rejoiced in what they\r\nsaw; but grieving also for their friends who were slain in the battle.\r\nAnd the Duke stood meanwhile among them of noble stature and mien; and\r\nrendered thanks to the King of Glory, through whom he had the victory;\r\nand thanked the knights around him, mourning also frequently for the\r\ndead. And he ate and drank among the dead, and made his bed that night\r\nupon the field.\r\n\r\n\"The morrow was Sunday; and those who had slept upon the field of\r\nbattle, keeping watch around, and suffering great fatigue, bestirred\r\nthemselves at break of day and sought out and buried such of the bodies\r\nof their dead friends as they might find. The noble ladies of the land\r\nalso came, some to seek their husbands, and others their fathers, sons,\r\nor brothers. They bore the bodies to their villages, and interred them\r\nat the churches; and the clerks and priests of the country were ready,\r\nand at the request of their friends, took the bodies that were found,\r\nand prepared graves and laid them therein.\r\n\r\n\"King Harold was carried and buried at Varham; but I know not who it was\r\nthat bore him thither, neither do I know who buried him. Many remained\r\non the field, and many had fled in the night.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is a Norman account of the battle of Hastings, which does full\r\njustice to the valour of the Saxons, as well as to the skill and bravery\r\nof the victors. [In the preceding pages, I have woven together the\r\n\"purpureos pannos\" of the old chronicler. In so doing, I have largely\r\navailed myself of Mr. Edgar Taylor's version of that part of the \"Roman\r\nde Rou\" which describes the conquest. By giving engravings from the\r\nBayeux Tapestry, and excellent notes, Mr. Taylor has added much to the\r\nvalue and interest of his volume.] It is indeed evident that the loss of\r\nthe battle to the English was owing to the wound which Harold received\r\nin the afternoon, and which must have incapacitated him from effective\r\ncommand. When we remember that he had himself just won the battle of\r\nStamford Bridge over Harald Hardrada by the manoeuvre of a feigned\r\nflight, it is impossible to suppose that he could be deceived by the\r\nsame stratagem on the part of the Normans at Hastings. But his men,\r\nwhen deprived of his control would very naturally be led by their\r\ninconsiderate ardour into the pursuit that proved so fatal to them.\r\nAll the narratives of the battle, however much they may vary as to the\r\nprecise time and manner of Harold's fall, eulogise the generalship and\r\nthe personal prowess which he displayed, until the fatal arrow struck\r\nhim. The skill with which he had posted his army was proved, both by the\r\nslaughter which it cost the Normans to force the position, and also by\r\nthe desperate rally which some of the Saxons made, after the battle,\r\nin the forest in the rear, in which they cut off a large number of the\r\npursuing Normans. This circumstance is particularly mentioned by William\r\nof Poictiers, the Conqueror's own chaplain. Indeed, if Harold, or either\r\nof his brothers, had survived, the remains of the English army might\r\nhave formed again in the wood, and could at least have effected an\r\norderly retreat, and prolonged the war. But both Gurth and Leofwine, and\r\nall the bravest thanes of Southern England, lay dead on Senlac, around\r\ntheir fallen king and the fallen standard of their country. The exact\r\nnumber of the slain on the Saxon side is unknown; but we read that on\r\nthe side of the victors, out of sixty thousand men who had been engaged,\r\nno less than a fourth perished: so well had the English bill-men \"plied\r\nthe ghastly blow\" and so sternly had the Saxon battle-axe cloven Norman\r\ncasque and mail. [The Conqueror's chaplain calls the Saxon battle-axes\r\n\"saevissimas secures.\"] The old historian Daniel justly as well as\r\nforcibly remarks, [As cited in the \"Pictorial History.\"] \"Thus was\r\ntried, by the great assize of God's judgment in battle, the right\r\nof power between the English and Norman nations; a battle the most\r\nmemorable of all others; and, however miserably lost, yet most nobly\r\nfought on the part of England.\"\r\n\r\nMany a pathetic legend was told in after years respecting the\r\ndiscovery and the burial of the corpse of our last Saxon king. The main\r\ncircumstances, though they seem to vary, are perhaps reconcilable. [See\r\nthem collected in Lingard, vol. i p. 452, ET SEQ.; Thierry, vol i.\r\np. 299; Sharon Turner, Vol. i. p. 82; and Histoire de Normandie par\r\nLieguet, p. 242.] Two of the monks of Waltham abbey, which Harold had\r\nfounded a little time before his election to the throne, had accompanied\r\nhim to the battle. On the morning after the slaughter they begged and\r\ngained permission of the Conqueror to search for the body of their\r\nbenefactor. The Norman soldiery and camp-followers had stripped and\r\ngashed the slain; and the two monks vainly strove to recognise from\r\namong the mutilated and gory heaps around them the features of their\r\nformer king. They sent for Harold's mistress, Edith, surnamed \"the Fair\"\r\nand the \"Swan-necked,\" to aid them. The eye of love proved keener than\r\nthe eye of gratitude, and the Saxon lady, even in that Aceldama, knew\r\nher Harold.\r\n\r\nThe king's mother now sought the victorious Norman, and begged the dead\r\nbody of her son. But William at first answered in his wrath, and in the\r\nhardness of his heart, that a man who had been false to his word and his\r\nreligion should have no other sepulchre than the sand of the shore. He\r\nadded, with a sneer, \"Harold mounted guard on the coast while he was\r\nalive; he may continue his guard now he is dead.\" The taunt was an\r\nunintentional eulogy; and a grave washed by the spray of the Sussex\r\nwaves would have been the noblest burial-place for the martyr of Saxon\r\nfreedom. But Harold's mother was urgent in her lamentations and her\r\nprayers: the Conqueror relented: like Achilles, he gave up the dead body\r\nof his fallen foe to a parent's supplications; and the remains of King\r\nHarold were deposited with regal honours in Waltham Abbey.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas day of the same year, William the Conqueror was crowned at\r\nLondon, King of England.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF EVENTS BETWEEN THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS, A.D. 1066, AND JOAN\r\nOF ARC'S VICTORY AT ORLEANS, 1429.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1066-1087. Reign of William the Conqueror. Frequent risings of the\r\nEnglish against him, which are quelled with merciless rigour.\r\n\r\n1096. The first Crusade.\r\n\r\n1112. Commencement of the disputes about investitures between the\r\nemperors and the popes.\r\n\r\n1140. Foundation of the city of Lubeck, whence originated the Hanseatic\r\nLeague. Commencement of the feuds in Italy between the Guelphs and\r\nGhibellines.\r\n\r\n1146. The second Crusade.\r\n\r\n1154. Henry II. becomes King of England. Under him Thomas a Becket is\r\nmade Archbishop of Canterbury: the first instance of any man of the\r\nSaxon race being raised to high office in Church or State since the\r\nConquest.\r\n\r\n1170. Strongbow, earl of Pembroke, lands with an English army in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n1189. Richard Coeur de Lion becomes King of England. He and King Philip\r\nAugustus of France join in the third Crusade.\r\n\r\n1199-1204. On the death of King Richard, his brother John claims\r\nand makes himself master of England and Normandy and the other large\r\ncontinental possessions of the early Plantagenet princes. Philip\r\nAugustus asserts the cause of Prince Arthur, John's nephew, against him.\r\nArthur is murdered, but the French king continues the war against John,\r\nand conquers from him Normandy, Brittany, Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and\r\nPoictiers.\r\n\r\n1216. The barons, the freeholders, the citizens, and the yeomen of\r\nEngland rise against the tyranny of John and his foreign favourites.\r\nThey compel him to sign Magna Charta. This is the commencement of our\r\nnationality: for our history from this time forth is the history of a\r\nnational life, then complete, and still in being. All English history\r\nbefore this period is a mere history of elements, of their collisions,\r\nand of the processes of their fusion. For upwards of a century after the\r\nConquest, Anglo-Norman and Anglo-Saxon had kept aloof from each other:\r\nthe one in haughty scorn, the other in sullen abhorrence. They were two\r\npeoples, though living in the same land. It is not until the thirteenth\r\ncentury, the period of the reigns of John and his son and grandson, that\r\nwe can perceive the existence of any feeling of common patriotism among\r\nthem. But in studying the history of these reigns, we read of the old\r\ndissensions no longer. The Saxon no more appears in civil war against\r\nthe Norman; the Norman no longer scorns the language of the Saxon, or\r\nrefuses to bear together with him the name of Englishman. No part of the\r\ncommunity think themselves foreigners to another part. They feel that\r\nthey are all one people, and they have learned to unite their efforts\r\nfor the common purpose of protecting the rights and promoting the\r\nwelfare of all. The fortunate loss of the Duchy of Normandy in John's\r\nreign greatly promoted these new feelings. Thenceforth our barons' only\r\nhomes were in England. One language had, in the reign of Henry III.,\r\nbecome the language of the land; and that, also, had then assumed the\r\nform in which we still possess it. One law, in the eye of which all\r\nfreemen are equal without distinction of race, was modelled, and\r\nsteadily enforced, and still continues to form the groundwork of our\r\njudicial system.

By it Edward III.\r\nrenounces his pretensions to the French crown. The treaty is ill kept,\r\nand indecisive hostilities continue between the forces of the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n1414. Henry V. of England claims the crown of France, and resolves to\r\ninvade and conquer that kingdom. At this time France was in the most\r\ndeplorable state of weakness and suffering, from the factions that\r\nraged among her nobility, and from the cruel oppressions which the\r\nrival nobles practised on the mass of the community. \"The people were\r\nexhausted by taxes, civil wars, and military executions; and they had\r\nfallen into that worst of all states of mind, when the independence of\r\none's country is thought no longer a paramount and sacred object. 'What\r\ncan the English do to us worse than the things we suffer at the hands\r\nof our own princes?' was a common exclamation among the poor people of\r\nFrance.\" [Pictorial Hist. of England, vol. i. p. 28.]\r\n\r\n1415. Henry invades France, takes Harfleur, and wins the great battle of\r\nAgincourt.\r\n\r\n1417-1419. Henry conquers Normandy. The French Dauphin assassinates the\r\nDuke of Burgundy, the most powerful of the French nobles, at Montereau.\r\nThe successor of the murdered duke becomes the active ally of the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n1420. The Treaty of Troyes is concluded between Henry V. of England and\r\nCharles VI. of France, and Philip, duke of Burgundy. By this treaty it\r\nwas stipulated that Henry should marry the Princess Catherine of France;\r\nthat King Charles, during his life-time, should keep the title and\r\ndignity of King of France, but that Henry should succeed him, and should\r\nat once be entrusted with the administration of the government, and\r\nthat the French crown should descend to Henry's heirs; that France\r\nand England should for ever be united under one king, but should still\r\nretain their several usages, customs, and privileges; that all the\r\nprinces, peers, vassals, and communities of France should swear\r\nallegiance to Henry as their future king, and should pay him present\r\nobedience as regent; that Henry should unite his arms to those of King\r\nCharles and the Duke of Burgundy, in order to subdue the adherents of\r\nCharles, the pretended dauphin; and that these three princes should make\r\nno truce or peace with the Dauphin, but by the common consent of all\r\nthree.\r\n\r\n1421. Henry V. gains several victories over the French, who refuse to\r\nacknowledge the treaty of Troyes. His son, afterwards Henry VI., is\r\nborn.\r\n\r\n1422. Henry V. and Charles VI. of France die. Henry VI. is proclaimed at\r\nParis, King of England and France. The followers of the French Dauphin\r\nproclaim him Charles VII., King of France. The Duke of Bedford, the\r\nEnglish Regent in France, defeats the army of the Dauphin at Crevant.\r\n\r\n1424. The Duke of Bedford gains the great victory of Verneuil over the\r\nFrench partizans of the Dauphin, and their Scotch auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n1428. The English begin the siege of Orleans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. -- JOAN OF ARC'S VICTORY OVER THE ENGLISH AT ORLEANS, A.D.\r\n1429.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The eyes of all Europe were turned towards this scene; where, it\r\n   was reasonably supposed, the French were to make their last stand\r\n   for maintaining the independence of their monarchy and the rights\r\n   of their; sovereign\"--HUME.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, after their victory at Salamis, the generals of the various\r\nGreek states voted the prizes for distinguished individual merit,\r\neach assigned the first place of excellence to himself, but they all\r\nconcurred in giving their second votes to Themistocles. [Plutarch, Vit.\r\nThem. 17.] This was looked on as a decisive proof that Themistocles\r\nought to be ranked first of all. If we were to endeavour, by a similar\r\ntest, to ascertain which European nation has contributed the most to\r\nthe progress of European civilization, we should find Italy, Germany,\r\nEngland, and Spain, each claiming the first degree, but each also naming\r\nFrance as clearly next in merit. It is impossible to deny her paramount\r\nimportance in history. Besides the formidable part that she has\r\nfor nearly three centuries played, as the Bellona of the European\r\ncommonwealth of states, her influence during all this period over the\r\narts, the literature, the manners and the feelings of mankind, has been\r\nsuch as to make the crisis of her earlier fortunes a point of world-wide\r\ninterest; and it may be asserted without exaggeration, that the future\r\ncareer of every nation was involved in the result of the struggle\r\nby which the unconscious heroine of France, in the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth century, rescued her country from becoming a second Ireland\r\nunder the yoke of the triumphant English.\r\n\r\nSeldom has the extinction of a a nation's independence appeared more\r\ninevitable than was the case in France, when the English invaders\r\ncompleted their lines round Orleans, four hundred and twenty-three years\r\nago. A series of dreadful defeats had thinned the chivalry of France,\r\nand daunted the spirits of her soldiers. A foreign King had been\r\nproclaimed in her capital; and foreign armies of the bravest veterans,\r\nand led by the ablest captains then known in the world, occupied the\r\nfairest portions of her territory. Worse to her even than the fierceness\r\nand the strength of her foes were the factions, the vices, and the\r\ncrimes of her own children. Her native prince was a dissolute trifler,\r\nstained with the assassination of the most powerful noble of the land,\r\nwhose son, in revenge, had leagued himself with the enemy. Many more\r\nof her nobility, many of her prelates, her magistrates, and rulers, had\r\nsworn fealty to the English king. The condition of the peasantry amid\r\nthe general prevalence of anarchy and brigandage, which were added to\r\nthe customary devastations of contending armies, was wretched beyond the\r\npower of language to describe. The sense of terror and suffering seemed\r\nto have extended itself even to the brute creation.\r\n\r\n\"In sooth, the estate of France was then most miserable. There\r\nappeared nothing but a horrible face, confusion, poverty, desolation,\r\nsolitarinesse, and feare. The lean and bare labourers in the country did\r\nterrifie even theeves themselves, who had nothing left them to spoile\r\nbut the carkasses of these poore miserable creatures, wandering up\r\nand down like ghostes drawne out of their graves. The least farmes and\r\nhamlets were fortified by these robbers, English, Bourguegnons, and\r\nFrench, every one striving to do his worst; all men-of-war were\r\nwell agreed to spoile the countryman and merchant. EVEN THE CATTELL,\r\nACCUSTOMED TO THE LARUME BELL, THE SIGNE OF THE ENEMY'S APPROACH, WOULD\r\nRUN HOME OF THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY GUIDE BY THIS ACCUSTOMED MISERY.\" [De\r\nSerres, quoted in the notes to Southey's Joan of Arc.]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1428, the English, who were already masters of all\r\nFrance north of the Loire, prepared their forces for the conquest of the\r\nsouthern provinces, which yet adhered to the cause of the Dauphin. The\r\ncity of Orleans, on the banks of that river, was looked upon as the\r\nlast stronghold of the French national party. If the English could once\r\nobtain possession of it, their victorious progress through the residue\r\nof the kingdom seemed free from any serious obstacle. Accordingly,\r\nthe Earl of Salisbury, one of the bravest and most experienced of the\r\nEnglish generals, who had been trained under Henry V., marched to the\r\nattack of the all-important city; and, after reducing several places of\r\ninferior consequence in the neighbourhood, appeared with his army before\r\nits walls on the 12th of October, 1428.\r\n\r\nThe city of Orleans itself was on the north side of the Loire, but its\r\nsuburbs extended far on the southern side, and a strong bridge connected\r\nthem with the town. A fortification which in modern military phrase\r\nwould be termed a tete-du-pont, defended the bridge-head on the southern\r\nside, and two towers, called the Tourelles, were built on the bridge\r\nitself, where it rested on an island at a little distance from the\r\ntete-du-pont. Indeed, the solid masonry of the bridge terminated at the\r\nTourelles; and the communication thence with the tete-du-pont on the\r\nsouthern shore was by means of a drawbridge. The Tourelles and the\r\ntete-du-pont formed together a strong fortified post, capable of\r\ncontaining a garrison of considerable strength; and so long as this was\r\nin possession of the Orleannais, they could communicate freely with\r\nthe southern provinces, the inhabitants of which, like the Orleannais\r\nthemselves, supported the cause of their Dauphin against the foreigners.\r\nLord Salisbury rightly judged the capture of the Tourelles to be the\r\nmost material step towards the reduction of the city itself. Accordingly\r\nhe directed his principal operations against this post, and after\r\nsome severe repulses, he carried the Tourelles by storm, on the 23d of\r\nOctober. The French, however, broke down the part of the bridge which\r\nwas nearest to the north bank and thus rendered a direct assault from\r\nthe Tourelles upon the city impossible. But the possession of this post\r\nenabled the English to distress the town greatly by a battery of cannon\r\nwhich they planted there, and which commanded some of the principal\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed by Hume, that this is the first siege in which\r\nany important use appears to have been made of artillery. And even at\r\nOrleans both besiegers and besieged seem to have employed their cannons\r\nmore as instruments of destruction against their enemy's men, than\r\nas engines of demolition against their enemy's walls and works. The\r\nefficacy of cannon in breaching solid masonry was taught Europe by\r\nthe Turks, a few years after wards, at the memorable siege of\r\nConstantinople. In our French wars, as in the wars of the classic\r\nnations, famine was looked on as the surest weapon to compel the\r\nsubmission of a well-walled town and the great object of the besiegers\r\nwas to effect a complete circumvallation. The great ambit of the walls\r\nof Orleans, and the facilities which the river gave for obtaining\r\nsuccour and supplies, rendered the capture of the place by this process\r\na matter of great difficulty. Nevertheless, Lord Salisbury, and Lord\r\nSuffolk, who succeeded him in command of the English after his death\r\nby a cannon-ball, carried on the necessary works with great skill and\r\nresolution. Six strongly fortified posts, called bastillos, were formed\r\nat certain intervals round the town and the purpose of the English\r\nengineers was to draw strong lines between them. During the winter\r\nlittle progress was made with the entrenchments, but when the spring\r\nof 1429 came, the English resumed their works with activity; the\r\ncommunications between the city and the country became more difficult,\r\nand the approach of want began already to be felt in Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe besieging force also fared hardly for stores and provisions, until\r\nrelieved by the effects of a brilliant victory which Sir John Fastolfe,\r\none of the best English generals, gained at Rouvrai, near Orleans, a few\r\ndays after Ash Wednesday, 1429. With only sixteen hundred fighting men,\r\nSir John completely defeated an army of French and Scots, four\r\nthousand strong, which had been collected for the purpose of aiding the\r\nOrleannais, and harassing the besiegers. After this encounter, which\r\nseemed decisively to confirm the superiority of the English in battle\r\nover their adversaries, Fastolfe escorted large supplies of stores\r\nand food to Suffolk's camp, and the spirits of the English rose to the\r\nhighest pitch at the prospect of the speedy capture of the city before\r\nthem, and the consequent subjection of all France beneath their arms.\r\n\r\nThe Orleannais now in their distress offered to surrender the city into\r\nthe hands of the Duke of Burgundy, who, though the ally of the English,\r\nwas yet one of their native princes. The Regent Bedford refused these\r\nterms, and the speedy submission of the city to the English seemed\r\ninevitable. The Dauphin Charles, who was now at Chinon with his remnant\r\nof a court, despaired of maintaining any longer the struggle for his\r\ncrown; and was only prevented from abandoning the country by the more\r\nmasculine spirits of his mistress and his queen. Yet neither they, nor\r\nthe boldest of Charles's captains, could have shown him where to find\r\nresources for prolonging the war; and least of all could any human skill\r\nhave predicted the quarter whence rescue was to come to Orleans and to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIn the village of Domremy, on the borders of Lorraine, there was a poor\r\npeasant of the name of Jacques d'Arc, respected in his station of life,\r\nand who had reared a family in virtuous habits and in the practice of\r\nthe strictest devotion. His eldest daughter was named by her parents\r\nJeannette, but she was called Jeanne by the French, which was Latinised\r\ninto Johanna, and anglicised into Joan. [\"Respondit quod in partibus\r\nsuis vocabatur Johanneta, et postquam venit in Franciam vocata est\r\nJohanna.\"--PROCES DE JEANNE D'ARC, vol i. p. 46.]\r\n\r\nAt the time when Joan first attracted attention, she was about eighteen\r\nyears of age. She was naturally of a susceptible disposition, which\r\ndiligent attention to the legends of saints, and tales of fairies, aided\r\nby the dreamy loneliness of her life while tending her father's flocks,\r\nhad made peculiarly prone to enthusiastic fervour. At the same time\r\nshe was eminent for piety and purity of soul, and for her compassionate\r\ngentleness to the sick and the distressed.\r\n\r\n[Southey, in one of the speeches which he puts in the mouth of his Joan\r\nof Arc, has made her beautifully describe the effect; on her mind of the\r\nscenery in which she dwelt:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Here in solitude and peace\r\n      My soul was nurst, amid the loveliest scenes\r\n      Of-unpolluted nature.  Sweet it was,\r\n      As the white mists of morning roll'd away,\r\n      To see the mountain's wooded heights appear\r\n      Dark in the early dawn, and mark its slope\r\n      With gorse-flowers glowing, as the rising sun\r\n      On the golden ripeness pour'd a deepening light.\r\n      Pleasant at noon beside the vocal brook\r\n      To lay me down, and watch the the floating clouds,\r\n      And shape to Fancy's wild similitudes\r\n      Their ever-varying forms; and oh, how sweet,\r\n      To drive my flock at evening to the fold,\r\n      And hasten to our little hut, and hear\r\n      The voice of kindness bid me welcome home!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only foundation for the story told by the Burgundian partisan\r\nMonstrelet, and adopted by Hume, of Joan having been brought up as\r\nservant at an inn, is the circumstance of her having been once, with the\r\nrest of her family, obliged to take refuge in an AUBERGE in Neufchateau\r\nfor fifteen days, when a party of Burgundian cavalry made an incursion\r\ninto Domremy. (See the Quarterly Review, No. 138.)]\r\n\r\nThe district where she dwelt had escaped comparatively free from the\r\nravages of war, but the approach of roving bands of Burgundian or\r\nEnglish troops frequently spread terror through Domremy. Once the\r\nvillage had been plundered by some of these marauders, and Joan and her\r\nfamily had been driven from their home, and forced to seek refuge for a\r\ntime at Neufchateau. The peasantry in Domremy were principally attached\r\nto the House of Orleans and the Dauphin; and all the miseries which\r\nFrance endured, were there imputed to the Burgundian faction and their\r\nallies, the English, who were seeking to enslave unhappy France.\r\n\r\nThus from infancy to girlhood Joan had heard continually of the woes of\r\nthe war, and she had herself witnessed some of the wretchedness that it\r\ncaused. A feeling of intense patriotism grew in her with her growth. The\r\ndeliverance of France from the English was the subject of her reveries\r\nby day and her dreams by night. Blended with these aspirations were\r\nrecollections of the miraculous interpositions of Heaven in favour of\r\nthe oppressed, which she had learned from the legends of her Church. Her\r\nfaith was undoubting; her prayers were fervent. \"She feared no danger,\r\nfor she felt no sin;\" and at length she believed herself to have\r\nreceived the supernatural inspiration which, she sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to her own narrative, delivered by her to her merciless\r\ninquisitors in the time of her captivity and approaching death, she was\r\nabout thirteen years old when her revelations commenced. Her own words\r\ndescribe them best: [Proces de Jeanne d'Arc, vol. i. p. 52.] \"At the\r\nage of thirteen, a voice from God came near to her to help her in ruling\r\nherself, and that voice came to her about the hour of noon, in summer\r\ntime, while she was in her father's garden. And she had fasted the day\r\nbefore. And she heard the voice on her right, in the direction of\r\nthe church; and when she heard the voice she also saw a bright light.\r\nAfterwards, St. Michael and St. Margaret and St. Catherine appeared to\r\nher. They were always in a halo of glory; she could see that their heads\r\nwere crowned with jewels: and she heard their voices, which were sweet\r\nand mild. She did not distinguish their arms or limbs. She heard them\r\nmore frequently than she saw them; and the usual time when she heard\r\nthem was when the church bells were sounding for prayer. And if she was\r\nin the woods when she heard them, she could plainly distinguish their\r\nvoices drawing near to her. When she thought that she discerned the\r\nHeavenly Voices, she knelt down, and bowed herself to the ground. Their\r\npresence gladdened her even to tears; and after they departed she wept\r\nbecause they had not taken her with them back to Paradise. They always\r\nspoke soothingly to her. They told her that France would be saved, and\r\nthat she was to save it.\" Such were the visions and the Voices that\r\nmoved the spirit of the girl of thirteen; and as she grew older they\r\nbecame more frequent and more clear. At last the tidings of the siege of\r\nOrleans reached Domremy, Joan heard her parents and neighbours talk of\r\nthe sufferings of its population, of the ruin which its capture would\r\nbring on their lawful sovereign, and of the distress of the Dauphin and\r\nhis court. Joan's heart was sorely troubled at the thought of the fate\r\nof Orleans; and her Voices now ordered her to leave her home; and warned\r\nher that she was the instrument chosen by Heaven for driving away the\r\nEnglish from that city, and for taking the Dauphin to be anointed king\r\nat Rheims. At length she informed her parents of her divine mission, and\r\ntold them that she must go to the Sire de Baudricourt, who commanded\r\nat Vaucouleurs, and who was the appointed person to bring her into the\r\npresence of the king, whom she was to save. Neither the anger nor the\r\ngrief of her parents, who said that they would rather see her drowned\r\nthan exposed to the contamination of the camp, could move her from her\r\npurpose. One of her uncles consented to take her to Vaucouleurs, where\r\nDe Baudricourt at first thought her mad, and derided her; but by\r\ndegrees was led to believe, if not in her inspiration, at least in her\r\nenthusiasm and in its possible utility to the Dauphin's cause.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Vaucouleurs were completely won over to her side, by\r\nthe piety and devoutness which she displayed and by her firm assurance\r\nin the truth of her mission. She told them that it was God's will\r\nthat she should go to the King, and that no one but her could save the\r\nkingdom of France. She said that she herself would rather remain with\r\nher poor mother and spin; but the Lord had ordered her forth. The fame\r\nof \"The Maid,\" as she was termed, the renown of her holiness, and of\r\nher mission, spread far and wide. Baudricourt sent her with an escort to\r\nChinon, where the Dauphin Charles was dallying away his time. Her Voices\r\nhad bidden her assume the arms and the apparel of a knight; and the\r\nwealthiest inhabitants of Vaucouleurs had vied with each other in\r\nequipping her with warhorse, armour, and sword. On reaching Chinon,\r\nshe was, after some delay, admitted into the presence of the Dauphin.\r\nCharles designedly dressed himself far less richly than many of\r\nhis courtiers were apparelled, and mingled with them, when Jean\r\nwas introduced, in order to see if the Holy Maid would address her\r\nexhortations to the wrong person. But she instantly singled him out,\r\nand kneeling before him, said, \"Most noble Dauphin, the King of Heaven\r\nannounces to you by me, that you shall be anointed and crowned king in\r\nthe city of Rheims, and that you shall be His viceregent in France.\" His\r\nfeatures may probably have been seen by her previously in portraits, or\r\nhave been described to her by others; but she herself believed that\r\nher Voices inspired her when she addressed the King; [Proces de Jeanne\r\nd'Arc, vol. i. p. 56.] and the report soon spread abroad that the Holy\r\nMaid had found the King by a miracle; and this, with many other similar\r\nrumours, augmented the renown and influence that she now rapidly\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nThe state of public feeling in France was not favourable to an\r\nenthusiastic belief in Divine interposition in favour of the party that\r\nhad hitherto been unsuccessful and oppressed. The humiliations which had\r\nbefallen the French royal family and nobility were looked on as the just\r\njudgments of God upon them for their vice and impiety. The misfortunes\r\nthat had come upon France as a nation, were believed to have been drawn\r\ndown by national sins. The English, who had been the instruments of\r\nHeaven's wrath against France, seemed now by their pride and cruelty to\r\nbe fitting objects of it themselves. France in that age was a profoundly\r\nreligious country. There was ignorance, there was superstition there was\r\nbigotry; but there was Faith--a Faith that itself worked true miracles,\r\neven while it believed in unreal ones. At this time, also, one of those\r\ndevotional movements began among the clergy in France, which from time\r\nto time occur in national Churches, without it being possible for the\r\nhistorian to assign any adequate human cause for their immediate date or\r\nextension. Numberless friars and priests traversed the rural districts\r\nand towns of France, preaching to the people that they must seek\r\nfrom Heaven a deliverance from the pillages of the soldiery, and the\r\ninsolence of the foreign oppressors. [See, Sismondi vol. xiii. p. 114;\r\nMichelet, vol. v. Livre x.] The idea of a Providence that works only\r\nby general laws was wholly alien to the feelings of the age. Every\r\npolitical event, as well as every natural phenomenon, was believed to be\r\nthe immediate result of a special mandate of God. This led to the belief\r\nthat His holy angels and saints were constantly employed in executing\r\nHis commands and mingling in the affairs of men. The Church encouraged\r\nthese feelings; and at the same time sanctioned; the concurrent popular\r\nbelief that hosts of evil spirits were also ever actively interposing\r\nin the current of earthly events, with whom sorcerers and wizards could\r\nleague themselves, and thereby obtain the exercise of supernatural\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThus all things favoured the influence which Joan obtained both over\r\nfriends and foes. The French nation, as well as the English and the\r\nBurgundians, readily admitted that superhuman beings inspired her:\r\nthe only question was, whether these beings were good or evil angels;\r\nwhether she brought with her \"airs from heaven, or blasts from hell.\"\r\nThis question seemed to her countrymen to be decisively settled in her\r\nfavour, by the austere sanctity of her life, by the holiness of her\r\nconversation, but, still more, by her exemplary attention to all the\r\nservices and rites of the Church. The dauphin at first feared the injury\r\nthat might be done to his cause if he had laid himself open to the\r\ncharge of having leagued himself with a sorceress. Every imaginable\r\ntest, therefore, was resorted to in order to set Joan's orthodoxy and\r\npurity beyond suspicion. At last Charles and his advisers felt safe in\r\naccepting her services as those of a true and virtuous daughter of the\r\nHoly Church.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed probable that Charles himself, and some of his counsellors,\r\nmay have suspected Joan of being a mere enthusiast; and it is certain\r\nthat Dunois, and others of the best generals, took considerable latitude\r\nin obeying or deviating from the military orders that she gave. But over\r\nthe mass of the people and the soldiery, her influence was unbounded.\r\nWhile Charles and his doctors of theology, and court ladies, had been\r\ndeliberating as to recognising or dismissing the Maid, a considerable\r\nperiod had passed away, during which a small army, the last gleanings,\r\nas it seemed, of the English sword, had been assembled at Blois, under\r\nDunois, La Hire, Xaintrailles, and other chiefs, who to their natural\r\nvalour were now beginning to unite the wisdom that is taught by\r\nmisfortune. It was resolved to send Joan with this force and a convoy of\r\nprovisions to Orleans. The distress of that city had now become urgent.\r\nBut the communication with the open country was not entirely cut off:\r\nthe Orleannais had heard of the Holy Maid whom Providence had raised\r\nup for their deliverance, and their messengers urgently implored the\r\ndauphin to send her to them without delay.\r\n\r\nJoan appeared at the camp at Blois, clad in a new suit of brilliant\r\nwhite armour, mounted on a stately black war-horse, and with a lance\r\nin her right hand, which she had learned to wield with skill and grace.\r\n[See the description of her by Gui de Laval, quoted in the note to\r\nMichelet, p. 69; and see the account of the banner at Orleans, which is\r\nbelieved to bear an authentic portrait of the Maid, in Murray's Handbook\r\nfor France, p. 175.] Her head was unhelmeted; so that all could behold\r\nher fair and expressive features, her deep-set and earnest eyes, and her\r\nlong black hair, which was parted across her forehead, and bound by a\r\nribbon behind her back. She wore at her side a small battle-axe, and the\r\nconsecrated sword, marked on the blade with five crosses, which had\r\nat her bidding been taken for her from the shrine of St. Catherine at\r\nFierbois. A page carried her banner, which she had caused to be made and\r\nembroidered as her Voices enjoined. It was white satin [Proces de Jeanne\r\nd'Arc, vol. i. p. 238.] strewn with fleur-de-lis; and on it were the\r\nwords \"JHESUS MARIA,\" and the representation of the Saviour in His\r\nglory. Joan afterwards generally bore her banner herself in battle; she\r\nsaid that though she loved her sword much, she loved her banner forty\r\ntimes as much; and she loved to carry it because it could not kill any\r\none.\r\n\r\nThus accoutred, she came to lead the troops of France, who looked with\r\nsoldierly admiration on her well-proportioned and upright figure, the\r\nskill with which she managed her war-horse, and the easy grace with\r\nwhich she handled her weapons. Her military education had been short,\r\nbut she had availed herself of it well. She had also the good sense to\r\ninterfere little with the manoeuvres of the troops, leaving those things\r\nto Dunois, and others whom she had the discernment to recognise as the\r\nbest officers in the camp. Her tactics in action were simple enough. As\r\nshe herself described it--\"I used to say to them, 'Go boldly in among\r\nthe English,' and then I used to go boldly in myself.\" [Ibid.] Such, as\r\nshe told her inquisitors, was the only spell she used; and it was one of\r\npower. But while interfering little with the military discipline of the\r\ntroops, in all matters of moral discipline she was inflexibly strict.\r\nAll the abandoned followers of the camp were driven away. She compelled\r\nboth generals and soldiers to attend regularly at confessional. Her\r\nchaplain and other priests marched with the army under her orders; and\r\nat every halt, an altar was set up and the sacrament administered. No\r\noath or foul language passed without punishment or censure. Even the\r\nroughest and most hardened veterans obeyed her. They put off for a\r\ntime the bestial coarseness which had grown on them during a life of\r\nbloodshed and rapine; they felt that they must go forth in a new spirit\r\nto a new career, and acknowledged the beauty of the holiness in which\r\nthe heaven-sent Maid was leading them to certain victory.\r\n\r\nJoan marched from Blois on the 26th of April with a convoy of provisions\r\nfor Orleans, accompanied by Dunois, La Hire, and the other chief\r\ncaptains of the French; and on the evening of the 28th they approached\r\nthe town. In the words of the old chronicler Hall: [Hall, f. 127.] \"The\r\nEnglishmen, perceiving that they within could not long continue for\r\nfaute of vitaile and pouder, kepte not their watche so diligently as\r\nthei were accustomed, nor scoured now the countrey environed as thei\r\nbefore had ordained. Whiche negligence the citizens shut in perceiving,\r\nsente worde thereof to the French captaines, which with Pucelle in the\r\ndedde tyme of the nighte, and in a greats rayne and thunders, with all\r\ntheir vitaile and artillery entered into the citie.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it was day, the Maid rode in solemn procession through the city,\r\nclad in complete armour, and mounted on a white horse. Dunois was by\r\nher side, and all the bravest knights of her army and of the garrison\r\nfollowed in her train. The whole population thronged around her; and\r\nmen, women, and children strove to touch her garments, or her banner,\r\nor her charger. They poured forth blessings on her, whom they already\r\nconsidered their deliverer. In the words used by two of them afterwards\r\nbefore the tribunal, which reversed the sentence, but could not restore\r\nthe life of the Virgin-martyr of France, \"the people of Orleans, when\r\nthey first saw her in their city, thought that it was an angel from\r\nheaven that had come down to save them.\" Joan spoke gently in reply to\r\ntheir acclamations and addresses. She told them to fear God, and trust\r\nin Him for safety from the fury of their enemies. She first went to the\r\nprincipal church, where TE DEUM was chaunted; and then she took up her\r\nabode in the house of Jacques Bourgier, one of the principal citizens,\r\nand whose wife was a matron of good repute. She refused to attend a\r\nsplendid banquet which had been provided for her, and passed nearly all\r\nher time in prayer.\r\n\r\nWhen it was known by the English that the Maid was in Orleans, their\r\nminds were not less occupied about her than were the minds of those in\r\nthe city; but it was in a very different spirit. The English believed in\r\nher supernatural mission as firmly as the French did; but they thought\r\nher a sorceress who had come to overthrow them by her enchantments. An\r\nold prophecy, which told that a damsel from Lorraine was to save\r\nFrance, had long been current; and it was known and applied to Joan by\r\nforeigners as well as by the natives. For months the English had heard\r\nof the coming Maid; and the tales of miracles which she was said to have\r\nwrought, had been listened to by the rough yeomen of the English camp\r\nwith anxious curiosity and secret awe. She had sent a herald to the\r\nEnglish generals before she marched for Orleans; and he had summoned the\r\nEnglish generals in the name of the Most High to give up to the Maid\r\nwho was sent by Heaven, the keys of the French cities which they had\r\nwrongfully taken: and he also solemnly adjured the English troops,\r\nwhether archers, or men of the companies of war, or gentlemen, or\r\nothers, who were before the city of Orleans, to depart thence to their\r\nhomes, under peril of being visited by the judgment of God. On her\r\narrival in Orleans, Joan sent another similar message; but the English\r\nscoffed at her from their towers, and threatened to burn her heralds.\r\nShe determined before she shed the blood of the besiegers, to repeat\r\nthe warning with her own voice; and accordingly she mounted one of the\r\nboulevards of the town, which was within hearing of the Tourelles; and\r\nthence she spoke to the English, and bade them depart, otherwise they\r\nwould meet with shame and woe. Sir William Gladsdale (whom the French\r\ncall GLACIDAS) commanded the English post at the Tourelles, and he and\r\nanother English officer replied by bidding her go home and keep her\r\ncows, and by ribald jests, that brought tears of shame and indignation\r\ninto her eyes. But though the English leaders vaunted aloud, the effect\r\nproduced on their army by Joan's presence in Orleans, was proved four\r\ndays after her arrival; when, on the approach of reinforcements and\r\nstores to the town, Joan and La Hire marched out to meet them, and\r\nescorted the long train of provision waggons safely into Orleans,\r\nbetween the bastilles of the English, who cowered behind their walls,\r\ninstead of charging fiercely and fearlessly, as had been their wont, on\r\nany French band that dared to show itself within reach.\r\n\r\nThus far she had prevailed without striking a blow; but the time was now\r\ncome to test her courage amid the horrors of actual slaughter. On the\r\nafternoon of the day on which she had escorted the reinforcements into\r\nthe city, while she was resting fatigued at home, Dunois had seized an\r\nadvantageous opportunity of attacking the English bastille of St. Loup:\r\nand a fierce assault of the Orleannais had been made on it, which the\r\nEnglish garrison of the fort stubbornly resisted. Joan was roused by a\r\nsound which she believed to be that of Her Heavenly Voices; she called\r\nfor her arms and horse, and quickly equipping herself she mounted to\r\nride off to where the fight was raging. In her haste she had forgotten\r\nher banner; she rode back, and, without dismounting, had it given to her\r\nfrom the window, and then she galloped to the gate, whence the sally had\r\nbeen made. On her way she met some of the wounded French who had been\r\ncarried back from the fight. \"Ha,\" she exclaimed, \"I never can see\r\nFrench blood flow, without my hair standing on end.\" She rode out of the\r\ngate, and met the tide of her countrymen, who had been repulsed from the\r\nEnglish fort, and were flying back to Orleans in confusion. At the sight\r\nof the Holy Maid and her banner they rallied and renewed the assault.\r\nJoan rode forward at their head, waving her banner and cheering them on.\r\nThe English quailed at what they believed to be the charge of hell; St.\r\nLoup was stormed, and its defenders put to the sword, except some few,\r\nwhom Jean succeeded in saving. All her woman's gentleness returned when\r\nthe combat was over. It was the first time that she had ever seen a\r\nbattle-field. She wept at the sight of so many blood-stained and mangled\r\ncorpses; and her tears flowed doubly when she reflected that they were\r\nthe bodies of Christian men who had died without confession.\r\n\r\nThe next day was ascension-day, and it was passed by Joan in prayer. But\r\non the following morrow it was resolved by the chiefs of the garrison\r\nto attack the English forts on the south of the river. For this purpose\r\nthey crossed the river in boats, and after some severe fighting, in\r\nwhich the Maid was wounded in the heel, both the English bastilles of\r\nthe Augustins and St. Jean de Blanc were captured. The Tourelles were\r\nnow the only post which the besiegers held on the south of the river.\r\nBut that post was formidably strong, and by its command of the bridge,\r\nit was the key to the deliverance of Orleans. It was known that a fresh\r\nEnglish army was approaching under Falstolfe to reinforce the besiegers,\r\nand should that army arrive, while the Tourelles were yet in the\r\npossession of their comrades, there was great peril of all the\r\nadvantages which the French had gained being nullified, and of the siege\r\nbeing again actively carried on.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved, therefore, by the French, to assail the Tourelles at\r\nonce, while the enthusiasm which the presence and the heroic valour\r\nof the Maid had created was at its height. But the enterprise was\r\ndifficult. The rampart of the tete-du-pont, or landward bulwark, of\r\nthe Tourelles was steep and high; and Sir John Gladsdale occupied this\r\nall-important fort with five hundred archers and men-at-arms, who were\r\nthe very flower of the English army.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the 7th of May, some thousands of the best\r\nFrench troops in Orleans heard mass and attended the confessional by\r\nJoan's orders; and then crossing the river in boats, as on the preceding\r\nday they assailed the bulwark of the Tourelles, \"with light hearts and\r\nheavy hands.\" But Gladsdale's men, encouraged by their bold and skilful\r\nleader, made a resolute and able defence. The Maid planted her banner\r\non the edge of the fosse, and then springing down into the ditch, she\r\nplaced the first ladder against the wall, and began to mount. An English\r\narcher sent an arrow at her, which pierced her corslet and wounded\r\nher severely between the neck and shoulder. She fell bleeding from the\r\nladder; and the English were leaping down from the wall to capture her,\r\nbut her followers bore her off. She was carried to the rear, and laid\r\nupon the grass; her armour was taken off, and the anguish of her wound\r\nand the sight of her blood, made her at first tremble and weep. But her\r\nconfidence in her celestial mission soon returned: her patron saints\r\nseemed to stand before her and reassure her. She sate up and drew the\r\narrow out with her own hands. Some of the soldiers who stood by wished\r\nto stanch the blood, by saying a charm over the wound; but she forbade\r\nthem, saying, that she did not wish to be cured by unhallowed means. She\r\nhad the wound dressed with a little oil, and then bidding her confessor\r\ncome to her, she betook herself to prayer.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the English in the bulwark of the Tourelles, had\r\nrepulsed the oft-renewed efforts of the French to scale the wall.\r\nDunois, who commanded the assailants, was at first discouraged, and\r\ngave orders for a retreat to be sounded, Joan sent for him and the other\r\ngenerals, and implored them not to despair. \"By my God\" she said to\r\nthem, \"you shall soon enter in there. Do not doubt it. When you see my\r\nbanner wave again up to the wall, to your arms again! the fort is yours.\r\nFor the present rest a little, and take some food and drink. They did\r\nso,\" says the old chronicler of the siege, [Journal du Siege d'Orleans,\r\np. 87.] \"for they obeyed her marvellously.\" The faintness caused by\r\nher wound had now passed off, and she headed the French in another\r\nrush against the bulwark. The English, who had thought her slain, were\r\nalarmed at her reappearance; while the French pressed furiously and\r\nfanatically forward. A Biscayan soldier was carrying Joan's banner.\r\nShe had told the troops that directly the banner touched the wall they\r\nshould enter. The Biscayan waved the banner forward from the edge of\r\nthe fosse, and touched the wall with it; and then all the French host\r\nswarmed madly up the ladders that now were raised in all directions\r\nagainst the English fort. At this crisis, the efforts of the English\r\ngarrison were distracted by an attach from another quarter. The French\r\ntroops who had been left in Orleans, had placed some planks over the\r\nbroken part of the bridge, and advanced across them to the assault of\r\nthe Tourelles on the northern side. Gladsdale resolved to withdraw his\r\nmen from the landward bulwark, and concentrate his whole force in\r\nthe Tourelles themselves. He was passing for this purpose across the\r\ndrawbridge that connected the Tourelles and the tete-du-pont, when Joan,\r\nwho by this time had scaled the wall of the bulwark, called out to him,\r\n\"Surrender, surrender to the King of Heaven. Ah, Glacidas, you have\r\nfoully wronged me with your words, but I have great pity on your soul\r\nand the souls of your men.\" The Englishman, disdainful of her summons,\r\nwas striding on across the drawbridge, when a cannon-shot from the town\r\ncarried it away, and Gladsdale perished in the water that ran beneath.\r\nAfter his fall, the remnant of the English abandoned all further\r\nresistance. Three hundred of them had been killed in the battle, and two\r\nhundred were made prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe broken arch was speedily repaired by the exulting Orleannais; and\r\nJoan made her triumphal re-entry into the city by the bridge that had so\r\nlong been closed. Every church in Orleans rang out its gratulating\r\npeal; and throughout the night the sounds of rejoicing echoed, and the\r\nbonfires blazed up from the city. But in the lines and forts which the\r\nbesiegers yet retained on the northern shore, there was anxious watching\r\nof the generals, and there was desponding gloom among the soldiery. Even\r\nTalbot now counselled retreat. On the following morning, the Orleannais,\r\nfrom their walls, saw the great forts called \"London\" and \"St.\r\nLawrence,\" in flames; and witnessed their invaders busy in destroying\r\nthe stores and munitions which had been relied on for the destruction of\r\nOrleans. Slowly and sullenly the English army retired; but not before\r\nit had drawn up in battle array opposite to the city, as if to challenge\r\nthe garrison to an encounter. The French troops were eager to go out and\r\nattack, but Joan forbade it. The day was Sunday. \"In the name of God,\"\r\nshe said, \"let them depart, and let us return thanks to God.\" She led\r\nthe soldiers and citizens forth from Orleans, but not for the shedding\r\nof blood. They passed in solemn procession round the city walls; and\r\nthen, while their retiring enemies were yet in sight, they knelt in\r\nthanksgiving to God for the deliverance which he had vouchsafed them.\r\n\r\nWithin three months from the time of her first interview with the\r\nDauphin, Joan had fulfilled the first part of her promise, the raising\r\nof the siege of Orleans. Within three months more she fulfilled the\r\nsecond part also; and she stood with her banner in her hand by the high\r\naltar at Rheims while he was anointed and crowned as King Charles VII.\r\nof France. In the interval she had taken Jargeau, Troyes, and other\r\nstrong places; and she had defeated an English army in a fair field\r\nat Patay. The enthusiasm of her countrymen knew no bounds; but the\r\nimportance of her services, and especially of her primary achievement\r\nat Orleans, may perhaps be best proved by the testimony of her enemies.\r\nThere is extant a fragment of a letter from the Regent Bedford to his\r\nroyal nephew, Henry VI., in which he bewails the turn that the war\r\nhad taken, and especially attributes it to the raising of the siege\r\nof Orleans by Joan. Bedford's own words, which are preserved in Rymer,\r\n[Vol. x. p. 403.] are as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"AND ALLE THING THERE PROSPERED FOR YOU TIL THE TYME OF THE SIEGE OF\r\nORLEANS, TAKEN IN HAND, GOD KNOWETH BY WHAT ADVIS.\r\n\r\n\"AT THE WHICHE TYME, AFTER THE ADVENTURE FALLEN TO THE PERSONE OF MY\r\nCOUSIN OF SALISBURY, WHOM GOD ASSOILLE, THERE FELLE, BY THE HAND OF GOD\r\nAS IT SEEMETH, A GREAT STROOK UPON YOUR PEUPLE THAT WAS ASSEMBLED THERE\r\nIN GRETE NOMBRE, CAUSED IN GRETE PARTIE, AS Y TROWE, OF LAKKE OF SADDE\r\nBELEVE, AND OF UNLEVEFULLE DOUBTE, THAT THEI HADDE OF A DISCIPLE AND\r\nLYME OF THE FEENDE, CALLED THE PUCELLE, THAT USED FALS ENCHANTMENTS AND\r\nSORCERIE.\r\n\r\n\"THE WHICHE STROOKE AND DISCOMFITURE NOT OONLY LESSED IN GRETE PARTIE\r\nTHE NOMBRE OF YOUR PEUPLE THERE, BUT AS WELL WITHDREWE THE COURAGE OF\r\nTHE REMENANT IN MERVEILLOUS WYSE, AND COURAIGED YOUR ADVERSE PARTIE AND\r\nENNEMYS TO ASSEMBLE THEM FORTHWITH IN GRETE NOMBRE.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Charles had been anointed King of France, Joan believed that her\r\nmission was accomplished. And in truth the deliverance of France from\r\nthe English, though not completed for many years afterwards, was then\r\ninsured. The ceremony of a royal coronation and anointment was not\r\nin those days regarded as a mere costly formality. It was believed to\r\nconfer the sanction and the grace of heaven upon the prince, who had\r\npreviously ruled with mere human authority. Thenceforth he was the\r\nLord's Anointed. Moreover, one of the difficulties that had previously\r\nlain in the way of many Frenchman when called on to support Charles\r\nVII. was now removed. He had been publicly stigmatised, even by his own\r\nparents, as no true son of the royal race of France. The queen-mother,\r\nthe English, and the partisans of Burgundy, called him the \"Pretender\r\nto the title of Dauphin;\" but those who had been led to doubt his\r\nlegitimacy, were cured of their scepticism by the victories of the Holy\r\nMaid, and by the fulfilment of her pledges. They thought that heaven had\r\nnow declared itself in favour of Charles as the true heir of the crown\r\nof St. Louis; and the tales about his being spurious were thenceforth\r\nregarded as mere English calumnies. With this strong tide of national\r\nfeeling in his favour, with victorious generals and soldiers round him,\r\nand a dispirited and divided enemy before him, he could not fail to\r\nconquer; though his own imprudence and misconduct, and the stubborn\r\nvalour which some of the English still displayed, prolonged the war in\r\nFrance nearly to the time when the civil war of the Roses broke out in\r\nEngland, and insured for France peace and repose.\r\n\r\nJoan knelt before the new-crowned king in the cathedral of Rheims, and\r\nshed tears of joy. She said that she had then fulfilled the work which\r\nthe Lord had commanded her. The young girl now asked for her dismissal.\r\nShe wished to return to her peasant home, to tend her parent's flocks\r\nagain, and to live at her own will in her native village. [\"Je voudrais\r\nbien qu'il voulut me faire ramener aupres mes pere et mere, et garder\r\nleurs brebis et betail, et faire ce que je voudrois faire.\"] She had\r\nalways believed that her career would be a short one. But Charles and\r\nhis captains were loth to lose the presence of one who had such an\r\ninfluence upon the soldiery and the people. They persuaded her to stay\r\nwith the army. She still showed the same bravery and zeal for the cause\r\nof France. She was as fervent as before in her prayers, and as exemplary\r\nin all religious duties. She still heard her Heavenly Voices, but; she\r\nnow no longer thought herself the appointed minister of heaven to lead\r\nher countrymen to certain victory. Our admiration for her courage\r\nand patriotism ought to be increased a hundred-fold by her conduct\r\nthroughout the latter part of her career, amid dangers, against which\r\nshe no longer believed herself to be divinely secured. Indeed she\r\nbelieved herself doomed to perish in little more than a year; [\"Des le\r\ncommencement elle avait dit, 'Il me faut employer: je ne durerai qu'un\r\nan, ou guere plus.\"--MICHELAIT v. p. 101.] but she still fought on as\r\nresolutely, if not as exultingly as ever.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Arminius, the interest attached to individual heroism\r\nand virtue makes us trace the fate of Joan of Arc after she had saved\r\nher country. She served well with Charles's army in the capture of\r\nLaon, Soissons, Compeigne, Beauvais, and other strong places; but in a\r\npremature attack on Paris, in September 1429, the French were repulsed,\r\nand Joan was severely wounded in the winter she was again in the field\r\nwith some of the French troops; and in the following spring she threw\r\nherself into the fortress of Compeigne, which she had herself won for\r\nthe French king in the preceding autumn, and which was now besieged by a\r\nstrong Burgundian force.\r\n\r\nShe was taken prisoner in a sally from Compeigne, on the 24th of May,\r\nand was imprisoned by the Burgundians first at Arras, and then at a\r\nplace called Crotoy, on the Flemish coast, until November, when for\r\npayment of a large sum of money, she was given up to the English, and\r\ntaken to Rouen, which was then their main stronghold in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Sorrow it were, and shame to tell,\r\n      The butchery that there befell:\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the revolting details of the cruelties practised upon this young\r\ngirl may be left to those, whose duty as avowed biographers, it is\r\nto describe them. [The whole of the \"Proces de Condamnation at de\r\nRehabilitation de Jeanne d'Arc\" has been published in five volumes, by\r\nthe Societe de l'Histoire de France. All the passages from contemporary\r\nchroniclers and poets are added; and the most ample materials are\r\nthus given for acquiring full information on a subject which is, to an\r\nEnglishman, one of painful interest. There is an admirable essay on Joan\r\nof Arc, in the 138th number of the QUARTERLY.] She was tried before an\r\necclesiastical tribunal on the charge of witchcraft, and on the 30th of\r\nMay, 1431, she was burnt alive in the market-place at Rouen.\r\n\r\nI will add but one remark on the character of the truest heroine that\r\nthe world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nIf any person can be found in the present age who would join in the\r\nscoffs of Voltaire against the Maid of Orleans and the Heavenly Voices\r\nby which she believed herself inspired, let him read the life of the\r\nwisest and best man that the heathen nations ever produced. Let him\r\nread of the Heavenly Voice, by which Socrates believed himself to be\r\nconstantly attended; which cautioned him on his way from the field of\r\nbattle at Delium, and which from his boyhood to the time of his death\r\nvisited him with unearthly warnings. [See Cicero, de Divinatione, lib.\r\ni. sec. 41; and see the words of Socrates himself, in Plato, Apol. Soc.]\r\nLet the modern reader reflect upon this; and then, unless he is prepared\r\nto term Socrates either fool or impostor, let him not dare to deride or\r\nvilify Joan of Arc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF EVENTS BETWEEN JOAN OF ARC'S VICTORY AT ORLEANS, A.D. 1429,\r\nAND THE DEFEAT OP THE SPANISH ARMADA, A.D. 1588.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1452.

HIST. vol. i. p. 220.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 19th of July, A.D. 1588, a group of English\r\ncaptains was collected at the Bowling Green on the Hoe at Plymouth,\r\nwhose equals have never before or since been brought together, even at\r\nthat favourite mustering-place of the heroes of the British navy. There\r\nwas Sir Francis Drake, the first English circumnavigator of the globe,\r\nthe terror of every Spanish coast in the Old World and the New; there\r\nwas Sir John Hawkins, the rough veteran of many a daring voyage on the\r\nAfrican and American seas, and of many a desperate battle; there was Sir\r\nMartin Frobisher, one of the earliest explorers of the Arctic seas in\r\nsearch of that North-West Passage which is still the darling object of\r\nEngland's boldest mariners. There was the high-admiral of England, Lord\r\nHoward of Effingham, prodigal of all things in his country's cause, and\r\nwho had recently had the noble daring to refuse to dismantle part of the\r\nfleet, though the Queen had sent him orders to do so, in consequence of\r\nan exaggerated report that the enemy had been driven back and shattered\r\nby a storm. Lord Howard (whom contemporary writers describe as being of\r\na wise and noble courage, skilful in sea matters, wary and provident,\r\nand of great esteem among the sailors) resolved to risk his sovereign's\r\nanger, and to keep the ships afloat at his own charge, rather than that\r\nEngland should run the peril of losing their protection.\r\n\r\nAnother of our Elizabethan sea-kings, Sir Walter Raleigh, was at that\r\ntime commissioned to raise and equip the land-forces of Cornwall; but,\r\nas he was also commander of Plymouth, we may well believe that he\r\nmust have availed himself of the opportunity of consulting with the\r\nlord-admiral and other high officers which was offered by the English\r\nfleet putting into that port; and we may look on Raleigh as one of the\r\ngroup that was assembled at the Bowling Green on the Hoe. Many other\r\nbrave men and skilful mariners, besides the chiefs whose names have been\r\nmentioned, were there, enjoying, with true sailor-like merriment, their\r\ntemporary relaxation from duty. In the harbour lay the English fleet\r\nwith which they had just returned from a cruise to Corunna in search of\r\ninformation respecting the real condition and movements of the\r\nhostile, Armada. Lord Howard had ascertained that our enemies, though\r\ntempest-tost, were still formidably strong; and fearing that part of\r\ntheir fleet might make for England in his absence, he had hurried back\r\nto the Devonshire coast. He resumed his station at Plymouth, and waited\r\nthere for certain tidings of the Spaniard's approach.\r\n\r\nA match at bowls was being played, in which Drake and other high\r\nofficers of the fleet were engaged, when a small armed vessel was seen\r\nrunning before the wind into Plymouth harbour, with all sails set.\r\nHer commander landed in haste, and eagerly sought the place where\r\nthe English lord-admiral and his captains were standing. His name\r\nwas Fleming; he was the master of a Scotch privateer; and he told the\r\nEnglish officers that he had that morning seen the Spanish Armada off\r\nthe Cornish coast. At this exciting information the captains began to\r\nhurry down to the water, and there was a shouting for the ship's boats:\r\nbut Drake coolly checked his comrades, and insisted that the match\r\nshould be played out. He said that there was plenty of time both to win\r\nthe game and beat the Spaniards. The best and bravest match that ever\r\nwas scored was resumed accordingly. Drake and his friends aimed their\r\nlast bowls with the same steady calculating coolness with which they\r\nwere about to point their guns. The winning cast was made; and then they\r\nwent on board and prepared for action, with their hearts as light and\r\ntheir nerves as firm as they had been on the Hoe Bowling Green.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the messengers and signals had been despatched fast and far\r\nthrough England, to warn each town and village that the enemy had come\r\nat last. In every seaport there was instant making ready by land and by\r\nsea; in every shire and every city there was instant mustering of horse\r\nand man. [In Macaulay's Ballad on the Spanish Armada, the transmission\r\nof the tidings of the Armada's approach, and the arming of the English\r\nnation, are magnificently described. The progress of the fire-signals\r\nis depicted in lines which are worthy of comparison with the renowned\r\npassage in the Agamemnon, which describes the transmission of the\r\nbeacon-light announcing the fall of Troy, from Mount Ida to Argos.] But\r\nEngland's best defence then, as ever, was her fleet; and after warping\r\nlaboriously out of Plymouth harbour against the wind, the lord-admiral\r\nstood westward under easy sail, keeping an anxious look-out for\r\nthe Armada, the approach of which was soon announced by Cornish\r\nfishing-boats, and signals from the Cornish cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe England of our own days is so strong, and the Spain of our own days\r\nis so feeble, that it is not possible, without some reflection and care,\r\nto comprehend the full extent of the peril which England then ran from\r\nthe power and the ambition of Spain, or to appreciate the importance\r\nof that crisis in the history of the world. We had then no Indian or\r\nColonial Empire save the feeble germs of our North American settlements,\r\nwhich Raleigh and Gilbert had recently planted. Scotland was a separate\r\nkingdom; and Ireland was then even a greater source of weakness, and\r\na worse nest of rebellion than she has been in after times. Queen\r\nElizabeth had found at her accession an encumbered revenue, a divided\r\npeople and an unsuccessful foreign war, in which the last remnant of our\r\npossessions in France had been lost; she had also a formidable pretender\r\nto her crown, whose interests were favoured by all the Roman Catholic\r\npowers; and even some of her subjects were warped by religious bigotry\r\nto deny her title, and to look on her as an heretical usurper. It is\r\ntrue that during the years of her reign which had passed away before the\r\nattempted invasion of 1588, she had revived the commercial prosperity,\r\nthe national spirit, and the national loyalty of England. But her\r\nresources, to cope with the colossal power of Philip II., still seemed\r\nmost scanty; and she had not a single foreign ally, except the Dutch,\r\nwho were themselves struggling hard, and, as it seemed, hopelessly, to\r\nmaintain their revolt against Spain.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Philip II, was absolute master of an empire so\r\nsuperior to the other states of the world in extent, in resources and\r\nespecially in military and naval forces, as to make the project of\r\nenlarging that empire into a universal monarchy seem a perfectly\r\nfeasible scheme; and Philip had both the ambition to form that project,\r\nand the resolution to devote all his energies, and all his means, to\r\nits realization. Since the downfall of the Roman empire no such\r\npreponderating power had existed in the world. During the mediaeval\r\ncenturies the chief European kingdoms were slowly moulding themselves\r\nout of the feudal chaos. And, though their wars with each other were\r\nnumerous and desperate, and several of their respective kings figured\r\nfor a time as mighty conquerors, none of them in those times acquired\r\nthe consistency and perfect organization which are requisite for a\r\nlong-sustained career of aggrandizement. After the consolidation of\r\nthe great kingdoms, they for some time kept each other in mutual check.\r\nDuring the first half of the sixteenth century, the balancing system\r\nwas successfully practised by European statesmen. But when Philip II.\r\nreigned, France had become so miserably weak through her civil wars,\r\nthat he had nothing to dread from the rival state, which had so long\r\ncurbed his father the Emperor Charles V. In Germany, Italy, and Poland\r\nhe had either zealous friends and dependents, or weak and divided\r\nenemies. Against the Turks he had gained great and glorious successes;\r\nand he might look round the continent of Europe without discerning a\r\nsingle antagonist of whom he could stand in awe. Spain, when he acceded\r\nto the throne, was at the zenith of her power. The hardihood and spirit\r\nwhich the Arragonese, the Castilians, and the other nations of the\r\npeninsula had acquired during centuries of free institutions and\r\nsuccessful war against the Moors, had not yet become obliterated.\r\nCharles V. had, indeed, destroyed the liberties of Spain; but that had\r\nbeen done too recently for its full evil to be felt in Philip's time. A\r\npeople cannot be debased in a single generation; and the Spaniards under\r\nCharles V. and Philip II. proved the truth of the remark, that no nation\r\nis ever so formidable to its neighbours, for a time, as is a nation,\r\nwhich, after being trained up in self-government, passes suddenly under\r\na despotic ruler. The energy of democratic institutions survives for\r\na few generations, and to it are superadded the decision and certainty\r\nwhich are the attributes of government, when all its powers are\r\ndirected by a single mind. It is true that this preter-natural vigour\r\nis short-lived: national corruption and debasement gradually follow the\r\nloss of the national liberties; but there is an interval before their\r\nworkings are felt, and in that interval the most ambitious schemes of\r\nforeign conquest are often successfully undertaken.\r\n\r\nPhilip had also the advantage of finding himself at the head of a large\r\nstanding army in a perfect state of discipline and equipment, in an age\r\nwhen, except some few insignificant corps, standing armies were unknown\r\nin Christendom. The renown of the Spanish troops was justly high, and\r\nthe infantry in particular was considered the best in the world. His\r\nfleet, also, was far more numerous, and better appointed, than that of\r\nany other European power; and both his soldiers and his sailors had the\r\nconfidence in themselves and their commanders, which a long career of\r\nsuccessful warfare alone can create.\r\n\r\nBesides the Spanish crown, Philip succeeded to the kingdom, of Naples\r\nand Sicily, the Duchy of Milan, Franche-Comte, and the Netherlands. In\r\nAfrica he possessed Tunis, Oran, the Cape Verde and the Canary Islands;\r\nand in Asia, the Philippine and Sunda Islands and a part of the\r\nMoluccas. Beyond the Atlantic he was lord of the most splendid portions\r\nof the New world which \"Columbus found for Castile and Leon.\" The empire\r\nof Peru and Mexico, New Spain, and Chili, with their abundant mines of\r\nthe precious metals, Hispaniola and Cuba, and many other of the American\r\nIslands, were provinces of the sovereign of Spain.\r\n\r\nPhilip had, indeed, experienced the mortification of seeing the\r\ninhabitants of the Netherlands revolt against his authority, nor\r\ncould he succeed in bringing back beneath the Spanish sceptre all\r\nthe possessions which his father had bequeathed to him. But he had\r\nreconquered a large number of the towns and districts that originally\r\ntook up arms against him. Belgium was brought more thoroughly into\r\nimplicit obedience to Spain than she had been before her insurrection,\r\nand it was only Holland and the six other Northern States that still\r\nheld out against his arms. The contest had also formed a compact and\r\nveteran army on Philip's side, which, under his great general, the\r\nPrince of Parma, had been trained to act together under all difficulties\r\nand all vicissitudes of warfare; and on whose steadiness and loyalty\r\nperfect reliance might be placed throughout any enterprise,\r\nhowever difficult and tedious. Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma,\r\ncaptain-general of the Spanish armies, and governor of the Spanish\r\npossessions in the Netherlands was beyond all comparison the greatest\r\nmilitary genius of his age. He was also highly distinguished for\r\npolitical wisdom and sagacity, and for his great administrative talents.\r\nHe was idolised by his troops, whose affections he knew how to win\r\nwithout relaxing their discipline or diminishing his own authority.\r\nPre-eminently cool and circumspect in his plans, but swift and energetic\r\nwhen the moment arrived for striking a decisive blow, neglecting no risk\r\nthat caution could provide against, conciliating even the populations\r\nof the districts which he attacked by his scrupulous good faith, his\r\nmoderation, and his address, Farnese was one of the most formidable\r\ngenerals that ever could be placed at the head of an army designed not\r\nonly to win battles, but to effect conquests. Happy it is for England\r\nand the world that this island was saved from becoming an arena for the\r\nexhibition of his powers.\r\n\r\nWhatever diminution the Spanish empire might have sustained in the\r\nNetherlands, seemed to be more than compensated by the acquisition of\r\nPortugal, which Philip had completely conquered in 1580. Not only that\r\nancient kingdom itself, but all the fruits of the maritime enterprises\r\nof the Portuguese had fallen into Philip's hands. All the Portuguese\r\ncolonies in America, Africa, and the East Indies, acknowledged the\r\nsovereignty of the King of Spain; who thus not only united the\r\nwhole Iberian peninsula under his single sceptre, but had acquired a\r\ntransmarine empire, little inferior in wealth and extent to that which\r\nhe had inherited at his accession. The splendid victory which his\r\nfleet, in conjunction with the Papal and Venetian galleys, had gained at\r\nLepanto over the Turks, had deservedly exalted the fame of the Spanish\r\nmarine throughout Christendom; and when Philip had reigned thirty-five\r\nyears, the vigour of his empire seemed unbroken, and the glory of the\r\nSpanish arms had increased, and was increasing throughout the world.\r\n\r\nOne nation only had been his active, his persevering, and his successful\r\nfoe. England had encouraged his revolted subjects in Flanders against\r\nhim, and given them the aid in men and money without which they must\r\nsoon have been humbled in the dust. English ships had plundered his\r\ncolonies; had denied his supremacy in the New World, as well as the\r\nOld; they had inflicted ignominious defeats on his squadrons; they\r\nhad captured his cities, and burned his arsenals on the very coasts\r\nof Spain. The English had made Philip himself the object of personal\r\ninsult. He was held up to ridicule in their stage plays and masks, and\r\nthese scoffs at the man had (as is not unusual in such cases) excited\r\nthe anger of the absolute king, even more vehemently than the injuries\r\ninflicted on his power. [See Ranke's Hist. Popes, vol. ii. p. 170.]\r\nPersonal as well as political revenge urged him to attack England. Were\r\nshe once subdued, the Dutch must submit; France could not cope with him,\r\nthe empire would not oppose him; and universal dominion seemed sure to\r\nbe the result of the conquest of that malignant island.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another and a stronger feeling which armed King Philip\r\nagainst England. He was one of the sincerest and sternest bigots of his\r\nage. He looked on himself, and was looked on by others, as the\r\nappointed champion to extirpate heresy and re-establish the Papal power\r\nthroughout Europe. A powerful reaction against Protestantism had\r\ntaken place since the commencement of the second half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and Philip believed that he was destined to complete it. The\r\nReform doctrines had been thoroughly rooted out from Italy and Spain.\r\nBelgium, which had previously been half Protestant, had been reconquered\r\nboth in allegiance and creed by Philip, and had become one of the most\r\nCatholic countries in the world. Half Germany had been won back to\r\nthe old faith. In Savoy, in Switzerland and many other countries, the\r\nprogress of the counter-Reformation had been rapid and decisive. The\r\nCatholic league seemed victorious in France. The Papal Court itself had\r\nshaken off the supineness of recent centuries; and, at the head of the\r\nJesuits and the other new ecclesiastical orders, was displaying a vigour\r\nand a boldness worthy of the days of Hildebrand or Innocent III.\r\n\r\nThroughout continental Europe, the Protestants, discomfited and\r\ndismayed, looked to England as their protector and refuge. England was\r\nthe acknowledged central point of Protestant power and policy; and to\r\nconquer England was to stab Protestantism to the very heart. Sixtus V.,\r\nthe then reigning pope, earnestly exhorted Philip to this enterprise.\r\nAnd when the tidings reached Italy and Spain that the Protestant Queen\r\nof England had put to death her Catholic prisoner, Mary Queen of Scots,\r\nthe fury of the Vatican and Escurial knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Parma, who was appointed military chief of the expedition,\r\ncollected on the coast of Flanders a veteran force that was to play a\r\nprincipal part in the conquest of England. Besides the troops who were\r\nin his garrisons, or under his colours, five thousand infantry were sent\r\nto him from northern and central Italy, four thousand from the kingdom\r\nof Naples, six thousand from Castile, three thousand from Arragon,\r\nthree thousand from Austria and Germany, together with four squadrons\r\nof heavy-armed horse; besides which he received forces from the\r\nFranche-Comte and the Walloon country. By his command, the forest of\r\nWaes was felled for the purpose of building flat-bottomed boats, which,\r\nfloating down the rivers and canals to Meinport and Dunkerque, were to\r\ncarry this large army of chosen troops to the mouth of the Thames, under\r\nthe escort of the great Spanish fleet. Gun-carriages, fascines, machines\r\nused in sieges, together with every material requisite for building\r\nbridges, forming camps, and raising fortresses, were to be placed on\r\nboard the flotillas of the Prince of Parma, who followed up the conquest\r\nof the Netherlands, whilst he was making preparations for the invasion\r\nof this island. Favoured by the dissensions between the insurgents of\r\nthe United Provinces and Leicester, the Prince of Parma had recovered\r\nDeventer, as well as a fort before Zutphen, which the English\r\ncommanders, Sir William Stanley, the friend of Babbington, and Sir\r\nRoland York, had surrendered to him, when with their troops they passed\r\nover to the service of Philip II., after the death of Mary Stuart, and\r\nhe had also made himself master of the Sluys. His intention was to leave\r\nto the Count de Mansfeldt sufficient forces to follow up the war with\r\nthe Dutch, which had now become a secondary object, whilst he himself\r\nwent at the head of fifty thousand men of the Armada and the flotilla,\r\nto accomplish the principal enterprise--that enterprise, which, in the\r\nhighest degree, affected the interests of the pontifical authority. In\r\na bull, intended to be kept secret until the day of landing, Sixtus\r\nV., renewing the anathema fulminated against Elizabeth by Pius V. and\r\nGregory XIII., affected to depose her from our throne. [See Mignet's\r\nMary Queen of Scots vol. ii.]\r\n\r\nElizabeth was denounced as a murderous heretic whose destruction was an\r\ninstant duty. A formal treaty was concluded (in June, 1587), by which\r\nthe pope bound himself to contribute a million of scudi to the expenses\r\nof the war; the money to be paid as soon as the king had actual\r\npossession of an English port. Philip, on his part, strained the\r\nresources of his vast empire to the utmost. The French Catholic chiefs\r\neagerly co-operated with him. In the sea-ports of the Mediterranean, and\r\nalong almost the whole coast from Gibraltar to Jutland, the preparations\r\nfor the great armament were urged forward with all the earnestness of\r\nreligious zeal, as well as of angry ambition.--\"Thus,\" says the German\r\nhistorian of the Popes, [Ranke, vol ii. p. 172.] \"thus did the united\r\npowers of Italy and Spain, from which such mighty influences had gone\r\nforth over the whole world, now rouse themselves for an attack upon\r\nEngland! The king had already compiled, from the archives of Simancas,\r\na statement of the claims which he had to the throne of that country\r\non the extinction of the Stuart line; the most brilliant prospects,\r\nespecially that of an universal dominion of the seas, were associated\r\nin his mind with this enterprise. Everything seemed to conspire to such\r\nend; the predominance of Catholicism in Germany, the renewed attack upon\r\nthe Huguenots in France, the attempt upon Geneva, and the enterprise\r\nagainst England. At the same moment a thoroughly Catholic prince,\r\nSigismund III., ascended the throne of Poland, with the prospect also of\r\nfuture succession to the throne of Sweden. But whenever any principle\r\nor power, be it what it may, aims at unlimited supremacy in Europe, some\r\nvigorous resistance to it, having its origin in the deepest springs\r\nof human nature, invariably arises. Philip II. had had, to encounter\r\nnewly-awakened powers, braced by the vigour of youth, and elevated by a\r\nsense of their future destiny. The intrepid corsairs, who had rendered\r\nevery sea insecure, now clustered round the coasts of their native\r\nisland. The Protestants in a body,--even the Puritans, although they had\r\nbeen subjected to as severe oppressions as the Catholics,--rallied round\r\ntheir queen, who now gave admirable proof of her masculine courage, and\r\nher princely talent of winning the affections, and leading the minds,\r\nand preserving the allegiance of men.\"\r\n\r\nRanke should have added that the English Catholics at this crisis proved\r\nthemselves as loyal to their queen, and true to their country, as were\r\nthe most vehement anti-Catholic zealots in the island. Some few traitors\r\nthere were; but, as a body, the Englishmen who held the ancient faith,\r\nstood the trial of their patriotism nobly. The lord-admiral himself was\r\na Catholic, and (to adopt the words of Hallam) \"then it was that\r\nthe Catholics in every county repaired to the standard of the\r\nlord-lieutenant, imploring that they might not be suspected of bartering\r\nthe national independence for their religion itself.\" The Spaniard\r\nfound no partisans in the country which he assailed, nor did England,\r\nself-wounded,\r\n\r\n    \"Lie at the proud foot of her enemy.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time the destination of the enormous armament of Philip was not\r\npublicly announced. Only Philip himself, the Pope Sixtus, the Duke of\r\nGuise, and Philip's favourite minister, Mendoza, at first knew its real\r\nobject. Rumours were sedulously spread that it was designed to proceed\r\nto the Indies to realize vast projects of distant conquest. Sometimes\r\nhints were dropped by Philip's ambassadors in foreign courts, that his\r\nmaster had resolved on a decisive effort to crush his rebels in the Low\r\nCountries. But Elizabeth and her statesmen could not view the gathering\r\nof such a storm without feeling the probability of its bursting on their\r\nown shores. As early as the spring of 1587, Elizabeth sent Sir Francis\r\nDrake to cruise off the Tagus. Drake sailed into the Bay of Cadiz and\r\nthe Lisbon Roads, and burnt much shipping and military stores, causing\r\nthereby an important delay in the progress of the Spanish preparations.\r\nDrake called this \"Singeing the King of of Spain's beard.\" Elizabeth\r\nalso increased her succours of troops to the Netherlanders, to prevent\r\nthe Prince of Parma from overwhelming them, and from thence being at\r\nfull leisure to employ his army against her dominions.\r\n\r\nEach party at this time thought it politic to try to amuse its adversary\r\nby pretending to treat for peace, and negotiations were opened at Ostend\r\nin the beginning of 1588, which were prolonged during the first six\r\nmonths of that year. Nothing real was effected, and probably nothing\r\nreal had been intended to be effected by them. But, in the meantime,\r\neach party had been engaged in important communications with the chief\r\npowers in France, in which Elizabeth seemed at first to have secured a\r\ngreat advantage, but in which Philip ultimately prevailed. \"Henry III.\r\nof France was alarmed at the negotiations that were going on at Ostend;\r\nand he especially dreaded any accommodation between Spain and England,\r\nin consequence of which Philip II. might be enabled to subdue the United\r\nProvinces, and make himself master of France. In order, therefore, to\r\ndissuade Elizabeth from any arrangement, he offered to support her,\r\nin case she were attacked by the Spaniards, with twice the number\r\nof troops, which he was bound by the treaty of 1574 to send to her\r\nassistance. He had a long conference with her ambassador, Stafford,\r\nupon this subject, and told him that the Pope and the Catholic King had\r\nentered into a league against the queen, his mistress, and had invited\r\nhimself and the Venetians to join them, but they had refused to do\r\nso. 'If the Queen of England,' he added, 'concludes a peace with the\r\nCatholic king, that peace will not last three months, because the\r\nCatholic king will aid the League with all his forces to overthrow her,\r\nand you may imagine what fate is reserved for your mistress after\r\nthat.' On the other hand, in order most effectually to frustrate this\r\nnegotiation, he proposed to Philip II. to form a still closer union\r\nbetween the two crowns of France and Spain: and, at the same time, he\r\nsecretly despatched a confidential envoy to Constantinople to warn the\r\nSultan, that if he did not again declare war against the Catholic King,\r\nthat monarch, who already possessed the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain,\r\nthe Indies, and nearly all Italy, would soon make himself master of\r\nEngland, and would then turn the forces of all Europe against the\r\nTurks.\" [Mignet's History of Mary Queen of Scots. vol. ii.]\r\n\r\nBut Philip had an ally in France, who was far more powerful than the\r\nFrench king. This was the Duke of Guise, the chief of the League, and\r\nthe idol of the fanatic partisans of the Romish faith. Philip prevailed\r\non Guise openly to take up arms against Henry III. (who was reviled by\r\nthe Leaguers as a traitor to the true Church, and a secret friend to the\r\nHuguenots); and thus prevent the French king from interfering in favour\r\nof Queen Elizabeth. \"With this object, the commander, Juan Iniguez\r\nMoreo, was despatched by him in the early part of April to the Duke of\r\nGuise at Soissons. He met with complete success. He offered the Duke of\r\nGuise, as soon as he took the field against Henry III., three hundred\r\nthousand crowns, six thousand infantry, and twelve hundred pikemen,\r\non behalf of the king his master, who would, in addition, withdraw\r\nhis ambassador from the court of France, and accredit an envoy to the\r\nCatholic party. A treaty was concluded on these conditions, and the\r\nDuke of Guise entered Paris, where he was expected by the Leaguers, and\r\nwhence he expelled Henry III. on the 12th of May, by the insurrection of\r\nthe barricades. A fortnight after this insurrection, which reduced Henry\r\nIII. to impotence, and, to use the language of the Prince of Parma, did\r\nnot even 'permit him to assist the Queen of England with his tears, as\r\nhe needed them all to weep over his own misfortunes,' the Spanish fleet\r\nleft the Tagus and sailed towards the British isles.\" [Mignet.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in England, from the sovereign on the throne to the peasant in\r\nthe cottage, all hearts and hands made ready to meet the imminent\r\ndeadly peril. Circular letters from the queen were sent round to\r\nthe lord-lieutenants of the several counties requiring them \"to call\r\ntogether the best sort of gentlemen under their lieutenancy, and to\r\ndeclare unto them these great preparations and arrogant threatenings,\r\nnow burst forth in action upon the seas, wherein every man's particular\r\nstate, in the highest degree, could be touched in respect of country,\r\nliberty, wives, children, lands, lives, and (which was specially to be\r\nregarded) the profession of the true and sincere religion of Christ: and\r\nto lay before them the infinite and unspeakable miseries that would\r\nfall out upon any such change, which miseries were evidently seen by\r\nthe fruits of that hard and cruel government holden in countries not far\r\ndistant. We do look,\" said the queen, \"that the most part of them should\r\nhave, upon this instant extraordinary occasion, a larger proportion of\r\nfurniture, both for horseman and footmen, but especially horsemen, than\r\nhath been certified; thereby to be in their best strength against any\r\nattempt, or to be employed about our own person, or otherwise. Hereunto\r\nas we doubt not but by your good endeavours they will be the rather\r\nconformable, so also we assure ourselves, that Almighty God will so\r\nbless these their loyal hearts borne towards us, their loving sovereign,\r\nand their natural country, that all the attempts of any enemy whatsoever\r\nshall be made void and frustrate, to their confusion, your comfort, and\r\nto God's high glory.\" [Strype, cited in Southey's Naval History.]\r\n\r\nLetters of a similar kind were also sent by the council to each of the\r\nnobility, and to the great cities. The primate called on the clergy for\r\ntheir contributions; and by every class of the community the appeal was\r\nresponded to with liberal zeal, that offered more even than the queen\r\nrequired. The boasting threats of the Spaniards had roused the spirit of\r\nthe nation; and the whole people \"were thoroughly irritated to stir\r\nup their whole forces for their defence against such prognosticated\r\nconquests; so that, in a very short time, all the whole realm, and every\r\ncorner were furnished with armed men, on horseback and on foot; and\r\nthese continually trained, exercised, and put into bands, in warlike\r\nmanner, as in no age ever was before in this realm. There was no sparing\r\nof money to provide horse, armour, weapons, powder, and all necessaries;\r\nno, nor want of provision of pioneers, carriages, and victuals, in every\r\ncounty of the realm, without exception, to attend upon the armies. And\r\nto this general furniture every man voluntarily offered, very many their\r\nservices personally without wages, others money for armour and weapons,\r\nand to wage soldiers: a matter strange, and never the like heard of in\r\nthis realm or else where. And this general reason moved all men to large\r\ncontributions, that when a conquest was to be withstood wherein\r\nall should be lost, it was no time to spare a portion.\" [Copy of\r\ncontemporary letter in the Harleian Collection, quoted by Southey.]\r\n\r\nOur lion-hearted queen showed herself worthy of such a people. A camp\r\nwas formed at Tilbury; and there Elizabeth rode through the ranks,\r\nencouraging her captains and her soldiers by her presence and her words.\r\nOne of the speeches which she addressed to them during this crisis has\r\nbeen preserved; and, though often quoted, it must not be omitted here.\r\n\r\n\"My loving people,\" she said, \"we have been persuaded by some that are\r\ncareful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourselves to armed\r\nmultitudes for fear of treachery; but I assure you I do not desire to\r\nlive to distrust my faithful and loving people. Let tyrants fear! I have\r\nalways so behaved myself, that, under God, I have placed my chiefest\r\nstrength and safeguard in the loyal hearts and good will of my subjects;\r\nand, therefore, I am come amongst you, as you see, at this time, not for\r\nmy recreation or disport, but being resolved, in the midst and heat of\r\nthe battle, to live or die amongst you all, to lay down for my God, for\r\nmy kingdom, and for my people, my honour and my blood, even in the dust.\r\nI know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the\r\nheart and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too; and think it\r\nfoul scorn that Parma, or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should dare\r\nto invade the borders of my realm; to which, rather than any dishonour\r\nshall grow by me, I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your\r\ngeneral, judge, and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field.\r\nI know already for your forwardness you have deserved rewards and\r\ncrowns; and we do assure you, on the word of a prince, they shall be\r\nduly paid you. In the meantime, my lieutenant-general shall be in my\r\nstead, than whom never prince commanded a more noble or worthy subject,\r\nnot doubting but by your obedience to my general, by your concord in\r\nthe camp, and your valour in the field, we shall shortly have a famous\r\nvictory over those enemies of my God, of my kingdom, and of my people.\"\r\n\r\nWe have minute proofs of the skill with which the government of\r\nElizabeth made its preparations; for the documents still exist which\r\nwere drawn up at that time by the ministers and military men who were\r\nconsulted by Elizabeth respecting the defence of the country. [See note\r\nin Tytler's Life of Raleigh, p. 71.] Among those summoned to the advice\r\nof their queen at this crisis, were Sir Walter Raleigh, Lord Grey,\r\nSir Francis Knolles, Sir Thomas Leighton, Sir John Norris, Sir Richard\r\nGrenville, Sir Richard Bingham, and Sir Roger Williams; and the\r\nbiographer of Sir Walter Raleigh observes that \"These councillors were\r\nchosen by the queen, as being not only men bred to arms, and some of\r\nthem, as Grey, Norris, Bingham, and Grenville, of high military talents,\r\nbut of grave experience in affairs of state, and in the civil government\r\nof provinces,--qualities by no means means unimportant, when the debate\r\nreferred not merely to the leading of an army or the plan of a campaign,\r\nbut to the organization of a militia, and the communication with the\r\nmagistrates for arming the peasantry, and encouraging them to a resolute\r\nand simultaneous resistance. From some private papers of Lord\r\nBurleigh, it appears that Sir Walter took a principal share in these\r\ndeliberations; and the abstract of their proceedings, a document still\r\npreserved, is supposed to have been drawn up by him. They first prepared\r\na list of places where it was likely the Spanish army might attempt a\r\ndescent, as well as of those which lay most exposed to the forces under\r\nthe Duke of Parma. They next considered the speediest and most effectual\r\nmeans of defence, whether by fortification or the muster of a military\r\narray; and, lastly, deliberated on the course to be taken for fighting\r\nthe enemy if he should land.\"\r\n\r\nSome of Elizabeth's advisers recommended that the whole care and\r\nresources of the government should be devoted to the equipment of\r\nthe armies, and that the enemy, when he attempted to land, should be\r\nwelcomed with a battle on the shore. But the wiser counsels of Raleigh\r\nand others prevailed, who urged the importance of fitting out a fleet,\r\nthat should encounter the Spaniards at sea, and, if possible, prevent\r\nthem from approaching the land at all. In Raleigh's great work on the\r\n\"History of the World,\" he takes occasion, when discussing some of the\r\nevents of the first Punic war, to give his reasonings on the proper\r\npolicy of England when menaced with invasion. Without doubt, we have\r\nthere the substance of the advice which he gave to Elizabeth's council;\r\nand the remarks of such a man, on such a subject, have a general and\r\nenduring interest, beyond the immediate peril which called them forth.\r\nRaleigh [Historie of the World pp. 799--801.] says:--\"Surely I hold\r\nthat the best way is to keep our enemies from treading upon our ground:\r\nwherein if we fail, then must we seek to make him wish that he had\r\nstayed at his own home. In such a case if it should happen, our\r\njudgments are to weigh many particular circumstances, that belongs not\r\nunto this discourse. But making the question general, the positive,\r\nWHETHER England, WITHOUT THE HELP OF HER FLEET, BE ABLE TO DEBAR AN\r\nENEMY FROM LANDING; I hold that it is unable so to do; and therefore I\r\nthink it most dangerous to make the adventure. For the encouragement of\r\na first victory to an enemy, and the discouragement of being beaten, to\r\nthe invaded, may draw after it a most perilous consequence.\r\n\r\n\"Great difference I know there is, and a diverse consideration to\r\nbe had, between such a country as France is, strengthened with many\r\nfortified places; and this of ours, where our ramparts are but the\r\nbodies of men. But I say that an army to be transported over sea, and to\r\nbe landed again in an enemy's country, and the place left to the choice\r\nof the invader, cannot be resisted on the coast of England, without\r\na fleet to impeach it; no, nor on the coast of France, or any other\r\ncountry; except every creek, port, or sandy bay, had a powerful army,\r\nin each of them, to make opposition. For let the supposition be granted\r\nthat Kent is able to furnish twelve thousand foot, and that those twelve\r\nthousand be layed in the three best landing-places within that country,\r\nto wit, three thousand at Margat, three thousand at the Nesse, and six\r\nthousand at Foulkstone, that is, somewhat equally distant from them\r\nboth; as also that two of these troops (unless some other order be\r\nthought more fit) be directed to strengthen the third, when they shall\r\nsee the enemies' fleet to head towards it: I say, that notwithstanding\r\nthis provision, if the enemy, setting sail from the Isle of Wight,\r\nin the first watch of the night, and towing their long boats at their\r\nsterns, shall arrive by dawn of day at the Nesse, and thrust their army\r\non shore there, it will be hard for those three thousand that are at\r\nMargat (twenty-and-four long miles from thence), to come time enough to\r\nreinforce their fellows at the Nesse. Nay, how shall they at Foulkstone\r\nbe able to do it, who are nearer by more than half the way? seeing that\r\nthe enemy, at his first arrival, will either make his entrance by force,\r\nwith three or four shot of great artillery, and quickly put the first\r\nthree thousand that are entrenched at the Nesse to run, or else\r\ngive them so much to do that they shall be glad to send for help to\r\nFoulkstone, and perhaps to Margat, whereby those places will be left\r\nbare. Now let us suppose that all the twelve thousand Kentish soldiers\r\narrive at the Nesse, ere the enemy can be ready to disembarque his army,\r\nso that he will find it unsafe to land in the face of so many prepared\r\nto withstand him, yet must we believe that he will play the best of his\r\nown game (having liberty to go which way he list), and under covert of\r\nthe night, set sail towards the east, where what shall hinder him to\r\ntake ground either at Margat, the Downes, or elsewhere, before they,\r\nat the Nesse, can be well aware of his departure? Certainly there is\r\nnothing more easy than to do it. Yea, the like may be said of Weymouth,\r\nPurbeck, Poole, and of all landing-places on the south-west. For there\r\nis no man ignorant, that ships without putting themselves out of breath,\r\nwill easily outrun the souldiers that coast them. 'LES ARMEES NE VOLENT\r\nPOINT EN POSTE;'--'Armies neither flye, nor run post,' saith a marshal\r\nof France. And I know it to be true, that a fleet of ships may be seen\r\nat sunset, and after it at the Lizard, yet by the next morning they may\r\nrecover Portland, whereas an army of foot shall not be able to march it\r\nin six dayes. Again, when those troops lodged on the sea-shores, shall\r\nbe forced to run from place to place in vain, after a fleet of ships,\r\nthey will at length sit down in the midway, and leave all at adventure.\r\nBut say it were otherwise, that the invading enemy will offer to land in\r\nsome such place, where there shall be an army of ours ready to receive\r\nhim; yet it cannot be doubted, but that when the choice of all our\r\ntrained bands, and the choice of our commanders and captains, shall be\r\ndrawn together (as they were at Tilbury in the year 1588) to attend the\r\nperson of the prince, and for the defence of the city of London; they\r\nthat remain to guard the coast can be of no such force as to encounter\r\nan army like unto that wherewith it was intended that the Prince of\r\nParma should have landed in England.\r\n\r\n\"For end of this digression, I hope that this question shall never come\r\nto trial; his majestie's many moveable forts will forbid the experience.\r\nAnd although the English will no less disdain that any nation under\r\nheaven can do, to be beaten, upon their own ground, or elsewhere, by a\r\nforeign enemy; yet to entertain those that shall assail us with their\r\nown beef in their bellies, and before they eat of our Kentish capons, I\r\ntake it to be the wisest way; to do which his majesty, after God, will\r\nemploy his good ships on the sea, and not trust in any intrenchment upon\r\nthe shore.\"\r\n\r\nThe introduction of steam as a propelling power at sea, has added\r\ntenfold weight to these arguments of Raleigh, On the other hand, a\r\nwell-constructed system of railways, especially of coast-lines, aided\r\nby the operation or the electric telegraph, would give facilities for\r\nconcentrating a defensive army to oppose an enemy on landing, and for\r\nmoving troops from place to place in observation of the movements of the\r\nhostile fleet, such as would have astonished Sir Walter even more than\r\nthe sight of vessels passing rapidly to and fro without the aid of wind\r\nor tide. The observation of the French marshal, whom he quotes, is now\r\nno longer correct. Armies can be made to pass from place to place almost\r\nwith the speed of wings, and far more rapidly than any post-travelling\r\nthat was known in the Elizabethan or any other age. Still, the presence\r\nof a sufficient armed force at the right spot, at the right time, can\r\nnever be made a matter of certainty; and even after the changes that\r\nhave taken place, no one can doubt but that the policy of Raleigh is\r\nthat which England should ever seek to follow in defensive war. At the\r\ntime of the Armada, that policy certainly saved the country, if not from\r\nconquest, at least from deplorable calamities. If indeed the enemy had\r\nlanded, we may be sure that he would have been heroically opposed. But\r\nhistory shows us so many examples of the superiority of veteran troops\r\nover new levies, however numerous and brave, that without disparaging\r\nour countrymen's soldierly merits, we may well be thankful that no trial\r\nof them was then made on English land. Especially must we feel this,\r\nwhen we contrast the high military genius of the Prince of Parma, who\r\nwould have headed the Spaniards, with the imbecility of the Earl of\r\nLeicester, to whom the deplorable spirit of favouritism, which formed\r\nthe greatest blemish in Elizabeth's character, had then committed the\r\nchief command of the English armies.\r\n\r\nThe ships of the royal navy at this time amounted to no more than\r\nthirty-six; but the most serviceable merchant vessels were collected\r\nfrom all the ports of the country; and the citizens of London, Bristol,\r\nand the other great seats of commerce, showed as liberal a zeal in\r\nequipping and manning vessels as the nobility and gentry displayed in\r\nmustering forces by land. The seafaring population of the coast, of\r\nevery rank and station, was animated by the same ready spirit; and the\r\nwhole number of seamen who came forward to man the English fleet was\r\n17,472. The number of the ships that were collected was 191; and the\r\ntotal amount of their tonnage 31,985. There was one ship in the fleet\r\n(the Triumph) of 1100 tons, one of 1000, one of 900, two of 800 each,\r\nthree of 600, five of 600, five of 400, six of 300, six of 250, twenty\r\nof 200, and the residue of inferior burden. Application was made to the\r\nDutch for assistance; and, as Stows expresses it, \"The Hollanders came\r\nroundly in, with threescore sail, brave ships of war, fierce and full of\r\nspleen, not so much for England's aid, as in just occasion for their\r\nown defence; these men foreseeing the greatness of the danger that might\r\nensue, if the Spaniards should chance to win the day and get the mastery\r\nover them; in due regard whereof their manly courage was inferior to\r\nnone.\"\r\n\r\nWe have more minute information of the numbers and equipment of the\r\nhostile forces than we have of our own. In the first volume of Hakluyt's\r\n\"Voyages,\" dedicated to Lord Effingham, who commanded against the\r\nArmada, there is given (from the contemporary foreign writer, Meteran) a\r\nmore complete and detailed catalogue than has perhaps ever appeared of a\r\nsimilar armament.\r\n\r\n\"A very large and particular description of this navie was put in print\r\nand published by the Spaniards; wherein was set downe the number,\r\nnames, and burthens of the shippes, the number of mariners and soldiers\r\nthroughout the whole fleete; likewise the quantitie of their ordinance,\r\nof their armour of bullets, of match, of gun-poulder, of victuals,\r\nand of all their navall furniture, was in the saide description\r\nparticularized. Unto all these were added the names of the governours,\r\ncaptaines, noblemen, and gentlemen voluntaries, of whom there was so\r\ngreat a multitude, that scarce was there any family of accompt, or any\r\none principall man throughout all Spaine, that had not a brother, sonne,\r\nor kinsman in that fleete; who all of them were in good hope to purchase\r\nunto themselves in that navie (as they termed it) invincible, endless\r\nglory and renown, and to possess themselves of great seigniories and\r\nriches in England, and in the Low Countreys. But because the said\r\ndescription was translated and published out of Spanish into divers\r\nother languages, we will here only make an abridgement or brief\r\nrehearsal thereof.\r\n\r\n\"Portugal furnished and set foorth under the conduct of the Duke of\r\nMedina Sidonia, generall of the fleete, ten galeons, two zabraes,\r\n1300 mariners, 3300 souldiers, 300 great pieces, with all requisite\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\n\"Biscay, under the conduct of John Martines de Ricalde, admiral of the\r\nwhole fleete, set forth tenne galeons, four pataches, 700 mariners, 2000\r\nsouldiers, 260 great pieces, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Guipusco, under the conduct of Michael de Orquendo, tenne galeons, four\r\npataches, 700 mariners, 2000 souldiers, 310 great pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Italy with the Levant Islands, under Martine de Vertendona, ten\r\ngaleons, 800 mariners, 2000 souldiers, 310 great pieces, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Castile, under Diego Flores de Valdez, fourteen galeons, two pataches,\r\n1700 mariners, 2400 souldiers, and 388 great pieces, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Andaluzia, under the conduct of Petro de Valdez, ten galeons, one\r\npatache, 800 mariners, 2400 souldiers, 280 great pieces, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Item, under the conduct of John Lopez de Medina, twenty-three great\r\nFlemish hulkes, with 700 mariners, 3200 souldiers, and 400 great pieces,\r\n\r\n\"Item, under Hugo de Moncada, fours galliasses, containing 1200\r\ngally-slaves, 460 mariners, 870 souldiers, 200 great pieces, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Item, under Diego de Mandrana, fours gallies of Portugall with 888\r\ngally-slaves, 360 mariners, twenty great pieces, and other requisite\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\n\"Item, under Anthonie de Mendoza, twenty-two pataches and zabraes, with\r\n574 mariners, 488 souldiers, and 193 great pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Besides the ships aforementioned, there were twenty caravels rowed with\r\noares, being appointed to perform necessary services under the greater\r\nships, insomuch that all the ships appertayning to this navie amounted\r\nunto the summe of 150, eche one being sufficiently provided of furniture\r\nand victuals.\r\n\r\n\"The number of mariners in the saide fleete were above 8000, of slaves\r\n2088, of souldiers 20,000 (besides noblemen and gentlemen voluntaries),\r\nof great cast pieces 2600. The aforesaid ships were of an huge and\r\nincredible capacitie and receipt: for the whole fleete was large enough\r\nto contains the burthen of 60,000 tunnes.\r\n\r\n\"The galeons were 64 in number, being of an huge bignesse, and very\r\nflately built, being of marveilous force also, and so high, that they\r\nresembled great castles, most fit to defend themselves and to withstand\r\nany assault, but in giving any other ships the encounter farr inferiour\r\nunto the English and Dutch ships, which can with great dexteritie weild\r\nand turne themselves at all assayes. The upperworke of the said galeons\r\nwas of thicknesse and strength sufficient to bear off musket-shot. The\r\nlower works and the timbers thereof were out of measure strong, being\r\nframed of plankes and ribs fours or five foote in thicknesse, insomuch\r\nthat no bullets could pierce them, but such as were discharged hard at\r\nhand; which afterward prooved true, for a great number of bullets\r\nwere found to sticke fast within the massie substance of those thicke\r\nplankes. Great and well pitched cables were twined about the masts of\r\ntheir shippes, to strengthen them against the battery of shot.\r\n\r\n\"The galliasses were of such bignesse, that they contained within them\r\nchambers, chapels, turrets, pulpits, and other commodities of great\r\nhouses. The galliasses were rowed with great oares, there being in eche\r\none of them 300 slaves for the same purpose and were able to do great\r\nservice with the force of their ordinance. All these, together with\r\nthe residue aforenamed, were furnished and beautified with trumpets,\r\nstreamers, banners, warlike ensignes, and other such like ornaments.\r\n\r\n\"Their pieces of brazen ordinance were 1600, and of yron 1000.\r\n\r\n\"The bullets thereto belonging were 120 thousand.\r\n\r\n\"Item of gun-poulder, 5600 quintals. Of matche, 1200 quintals. Of\r\nmuskets and kaleivers, 7000. Of haleberts and partisans, 10,000.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover they had great store of canons, double-canons, culverings and\r\nfield-pieces for land services.\r\n\r\n\"Likewise they were provided of all instruments necessary on land to\r\nconveigh and transport their furniture from place to place; as namely of\r\ncarts, wheeles, wagons, &c. Also they had spades, mattocks, and baskets,\r\nto set pioners to works. They had in like sort great store of mules and\r\nhorses, and whatsoever else was requisite for a land-armie. They were so\r\nwell stored of biscuit, that for the space of halfe a yeere, they might\r\nallow eche person in the whole fleete halfe a quintall every month;\r\nwhereof the whole summe amounteth unto an hundreth thousand quintals.\r\n\r\n\"Likewise of wine they had 147 thousand pipes, sufficient also for halfe\r\na yeeres expedition. Of bacon, 6500 quintals. Of cheese, three thousand\r\nquintals. Besides fish, rise, beanes, pease, oils, vinegar, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover they had 12,000 pipes of fresh water, and all other necessary\r\nprovision, as, namely, candles, lanternes, lampes, sailes, hempe,\r\noxe-hides, and lead to stop holes that should be made with the battery\r\nof gun-shot. To be short, they brought all things expedient, either for\r\na fleete by sea, or for an armie by land.\r\n\r\n\"This navie (as Diego Pimentelli afterward confessed) was esteemed by\r\nthe king himselfe to containe 32,000 persons, and to cost him every day\r\n30 thousand ducates.\r\n\r\n\"There were in the said navie five terzaes of Spaniards (which terzaes\r\nthe Frenchmen call regiments), under the command of five governours,\r\ntermed by the Spaniards masters of the field, and amongst the rest\r\nthere were many olde and expert souldiers chosen out of the garisons\r\nof Sicilie, Naples, and Tercera. Their captaines or colonels were Diego\r\nPimentelli, Don Francisco de Toledo, Don Alonco de Lucon, Don Nicolas de\r\nIsla, Don Augustin de Mexia; who had each of them thirty-two companies\r\nunder their conduct. Besides the which companies, there were many bands\r\nalso of Castilians and Portugals, every one of which had their peculiar\r\ngovernours, captains, officers, colours, and weapons.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this huge armada was making ready in the southern ports of the\r\nSpanish dominions, the Prince of Parma, with almost incredible toil and\r\nskill, collected a squadron of war-ships at Dunkirk, and his flotilla of\r\nother ships and of flat-bottomed boats for the transport to England of\r\nthe picked troops, which were designed to be the main instruments in\r\nsubduing England. Thousands of workmen were employed, night and day, in\r\nthe construction of these vessels, in the ports of Flanders and Brabant.\r\nOne hundred of the kind called hendes, built at Antwerp, Bruges, and\r\nGhent, and laden with provision and ammunition, together with sixty\r\nflat-bottomed boats, each capable of carrying thirty horses, were\r\nbrought, by means of canals and fosses, dug expressly for the purpose,\r\nto Nieuport and Dunkirk. One hundred smaller vessels were equipped\r\nat the former place, and thirty-two at Dunkirk, provided with twenty\r\nthousand empty barrels, and with materials for making pontoons, for\r\nstopping up the harbours, and raising forts and entrenchments. The\r\narmy which these vessels were designed to convey to England amounted\r\nto thirty thousand strong, besides a body of four thousand cavalry,\r\nstationed at Courtroi, composed chiefly of the ablest veterans of\r\nEurope; invigorated by rest, (the siege of Sluys having been the only\r\nenterprise in which they were employed during the last campaign,) and\r\nexcited by the hopes of plunder and the expectation of certain conquest.\r\n[Davis's Holland, vol. ii. p. 219.] And \"to this great enterprise\r\nand imaginary conquest, divers princes and noblemen came from divers\r\ncountries; out of Spain came the Duke of Pestrana, who was said to be\r\nthe son of Ruy Gomez de Silva, but was held to be the king's bastard;\r\nthe Marquis of Bourgou, one of the Archduke Ferdinand's sons, by\r\nPhilippina Welserine; Don Vespasian Gonzaga, of the house of Mantua,\r\na great soldier, who had been viceroy in Spain; Giovanni de Medici,\r\nBastard of Florence; Amedo, Bastard of Savoy, with many such like,\r\nbesides others of meaner quality.\" [Grimstone, cited in Southey.]\r\n\r\nPhilip had been advised by the deserter, Sir William Stanley, not to\r\nattack England in the first instance, but first to effect a landing\r\nand secure a strong position in Ireland; his admiral, Santa Cruz, had\r\nrecommended him to make sure, in the first instance, of some large\r\nharbour on the coast of Holland or Zealand, where the Armada, having\r\nentered the Channel, might find shelter in case of storm, and whence\r\nit could sail without difficulty for England; but Philip rejected both\r\nthese counsels, and directed that England itself should be made the\r\nimmediate object of attack; and on the 20th of May the Armada left the\r\nTagus, in the pomp and pride of supposed invincibility, and amidst the\r\nshouts of thousands, who believed that England was already conquered.\r\nBut steering to the northward, and before it was clear of the coast of\r\nSpain, the Armada, was assailed by a violent storm, and driven back with\r\nconsiderable damage to the ports of Biscay and Galicia. It had, however,\r\nsustained its heaviest loss before it left the Tagus, in the death\r\nof the veteran admiral Santa Cruz, who had been destined to guide it\r\nagainst England.\r\n\r\nThis experienced sailor, notwithstanding his diligence and success, had\r\nbeen unable to keep pace with the impatient ardour of his master.\r\nPhilip II. had reproached him with his dilatoriness, and had said with\r\nungrateful harshness, \"You make an ill return for all my kindness to\r\nyou.\" These words cut the veteran's heart, and proved fatal to Santa\r\nCruz. Overwhelmed with fatigue and grief, he sickened and died. Philip\r\nII. had replaced him by Alonzo Perez de Gusman, Duke of Medina Sidonia,\r\none of the most powerful of the Spanish grandees, but wholly unqualified\r\nto command such an expedition. He had, however, as his lieutenants, two\r\nsea men of proved skill and bravery, Juan de Martinez Recalde of Biscay,\r\nand Miguel Orquendo of Guipuzcoa.\r\n\r\nThe report of the storm which had beaten back the Armada reached England\r\nwith much exaggeration, and it was supposed by some of the queen's\r\ncounsellors that the invasion would now be deferred to another year. But\r\nLord Howard of Effingham, the lord high-admiral of the English fleet,\r\njudged more wisely that the danger was not yet passed, and, as already\r\nmentioned, had the moral courage to refuse to dismantle his principal\r\nships, though he received orders to that effect. But it was not Howard's\r\ndesign to keep the English fleet in costly inaction, and to wait\r\npatiently in our own harbours, till the Spaniards had recruited their\r\nstrength, and sailed forth again to attack us. The English seamen of\r\nthat age (like their successors) loved to strike better than to parry,\r\nthough, when emergency required, they could be patient and cautious in\r\ntheir bravery. It was resolved to proceed to Spain, to learn the enemy's\r\nreal condition, and to deal him any blow for which there might be\r\nopportunity. In this bold policy we may well believe him to have been\r\neagerly seconded by those who commanded under him. Howard and Drake\r\nsailed accordingly to Corunna, hoping to surprise and attack some part\r\nof the Armada in that harbour; but when near the coast of Spain, the\r\nnorth wind, which had blown up to that time, veered suddenly to the\r\nsouth; and fearing that the Spaniards might put to sea and pass him\r\nunobserved, Howard returned to the entrance of the Channel, where he\r\ncruised for some time on the look-out for the enemy. In part of a letter\r\nwritten by him at this period, he speaks of the difficulty of guarding\r\nso large a breadth of sea--a difficulty that ought not to be forgotten\r\nwhen modern schemes of defence against hostile fleets from the south are\r\ndiscussed. \"I myself,\" he wrote, \"do lie in the midst of the Channel,\r\nwith the greatest force; Sir Francis Drake hath twenty ships, and four\r\nor five pinnaces, which lie towards Ushant; and Mr. Hawkins, with as\r\nmany more, lieth towards Scilly. Thus we are fain to do, or else with\r\nthis wind they might pass us by, and we never the wiser. The SLEEVE is\r\nanother manner of thing than it was taken for: we find it by experience\r\nand daily observation to be 100 miles over: a large room for me to\r\nlook unto!\" But after some time further reports that the Spaniards\r\nwere inactive in their harbour, where they were suffering severely from\r\nsickness, caused Howard also to relax in his vigilance; and he returned\r\nto Plymouth with the greater part of his fleet.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of July, the Armada having completely refitted, sailed again\r\nfor the Channel, and reached it without obstruction or observation by\r\nthe English.\r\n\r\nThe design of the Spaniards was, that the Armada should give them, at\r\nleast for a time, the command of the sea, and that it should join the\r\nsquadron which Parma had collected, off Calais. Then, escorted by an\r\noverpowering naval force, Parma and his army were to embark in their\r\nflotilla, and cross the sea to England where they were to be landed,\r\ntogether with the troops which the Armada brought from the ports of\r\nSpain. The scheme was not dissimilar to one formed against England a\r\nlittle more than two centuries afterwards.\r\n\r\nAs Napoleon, in 1805, waited with his army and flotilla at Boulogne,\r\nlooking for Villeneuve to drive away the English cruisers, and secure\r\nhim a passage across the Channel, so Parma, in 1588, waited for Medina\r\nSidonia to drive away the Dutch and English squadrons that watched his\r\nflotilla, and to enable his veterans to cross the sea to the land that\r\nthey were to conquer. Thanks to Providence, in each case England's enemy\r\nwaited in vain!\r\n\r\nAlthough the numbers of sail which the queen's government, and the\r\npatriotic zeal of volunteers, had collected for the defence of England\r\nexceeded the number of sail in the Spanish fleet, the English ships\r\nwere, collectively, far inferior in size to their adversaries; their\r\naggregate tonnage being less by half than that of the enemy. In the\r\nnumber of guns, and weight of metal, the disproportion was still\r\ngreater. The English admiral was also obliged to subdivide his force;\r\nand Lord Henry Seymour, with forty of the best Dutch and English\r\nships, was employed in blockading the hostile ports in Flanders, and in\r\npreventing the Prince of Parma from coming out of Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nThe orders of King Philip to the Duke de Medina Sidonia were, that he\r\nshould, on entering the Channel, keep near the French coast, and, if\r\nattacked by the English ships, avoid an action, and steer on to Calais\r\nroads, where the Prince of Parma's squadron was to join him. The hope of\r\nsurprising and destroying the English fleet in Plymouth, led the Spanish\r\nadmiral to deviate from these orders, and to stand across to the English\r\nshore; but, on finding that Lord Howard was coming out to meet him,\r\nhe resumed the original plan, and determined to bend his way steadily\r\ntowards Calais and Dunkirk, and to keep merely on the defensive against\r\nsuch squadrons of the English as might come up with him.\r\n\r\nIt was on Saturday, the 20th of July, that Lord Effingham came in sight\r\nof his formidable adversaries. The Armada was drawn up in form of a\r\ncrescent, which from horn to horn measured some seven miles. There was\r\na south-west wind; and before it the vast vessels sailed slowly on. The\r\nEnglish let them pass by; and then, following in the rear, commenced\r\nan attack on them. A running fight now took place, in which some of\r\nthe best ships of the Spaniards were captured; many more received heavy\r\ndamage; while the English vessels, which took care not to close with\r\ntheir huge antagonists, but availed themselves of their superior\r\ncelerity in tacking and manoeuvring, suffered little comparative loss.\r\nEach day added not only to the spirit, but to the number of Effingham's\r\nforce. Raleigh, Oxford, Cumberland, and Sheffield joined him; and \"the\r\ngentlemen of England hired ships from all parts at their own charge, and\r\nwith one accord came flocking thither as to a set field, where glory\r\nwas to be attained, and faithful service performed unto their prince and\r\ntheir country.\"\r\n\r\nRaleigh justly praises the English admiral for his skilful tactics. He\r\nsays, [Historie of the World, p. 791.] \"Certainly, he that will happily\r\nperform a fight at sea, must be skillful in making choice of vessels\r\nto fight in; he must believe that there is more belonging to a good\r\nman-of-war, upon the waters, than great daring; and must know that there\r\nis a great deal of difference between fighting loose or at large and\r\ngrappling. The guns of a slow ship pierce as well, and make as\r\ngreat holes, as those in a swift. To clap ships together, without\r\nconsideration, belongs rather to a madman than to a man of war; for by\r\nsuch an ignorant bravery was Peter Strossie lost at the Azores, when\r\nhe fought against the Marquis of Santa Cruza. In like sort had the Lord\r\nCharles Howard, admiral of England, been lost in the year 1588, if he\r\nhad not been better advised, than a great many malignant fools were,\r\nthat found fault with his demeanour. The Spaniards had an army aboard\r\nthem, and he had none; they had more ships than he had, and of higher\r\nbuilding and charging; so that, had he entangled himself with those\r\ngreat and powerful vessels, he had greatly endangered this kingdom of\r\nEngland. For, twenty men upon the defences are equal to a hundred\r\nthat board and enter; whereas then, contrariwise, the Spaniards had\r\na hundred, for twenty of ours, to defend themselves withall. But our\r\nadmiral knew his advantage, and held it: which had he not done, he had\r\nnot been worthy to have held his head.\"\r\n\r\nThe Spanish admiral also showed great judgment and firmness in following\r\nthe line of conduct that had been traced out for him; and on the 27th of\r\nJuly he brought his fleet unbroken, though sorely distressed, to anchor\r\nin Calais roads. But the King of Spain, had calculated ill the number\r\nand activity of the English and Dutch fleets; as the old historian\r\nexpresses it, \"It seemeth that the Duke of Parma and the Spaniards\r\ngrounded upon a vain and presumptuous expectation, that all the ships of\r\nEngland and of the Low Countreys would at the first sight of the Spanish\r\nand Dunkerk navie have betaken themselves to flight, yeelding them\r\nsea-room, and endeavouring only to defend themselves, their havens, and\r\nsea-coasts from invasion. Wherefore their intent and purpose was, that\r\nthe Duke of Parma, in his small and flat-bottomed ships should, as it\r\nwere, under the shadow and wing of the Spanish fleet, convey over all\r\nhis troupes, armour, and warlike provisions, and with their forces so\r\nunited, should invade England; or, while the English fleet were busied\r\nin fight against the Spanish, should enter upon any part of the coast\r\nwhich he thought to be most convenient. Which invasion (as the captives\r\nafterwards confessed) the Duke of Parma thought first to have attempted\r\nby the river of Thames; upon the banks whereof, having at the first\r\narrivall landed twenty or thirty thousand of his principall souldiers,\r\nhe supposed that he might easily have wonne the citie of London;\r\nboth because his small shippes should have followed and assisted\r\nhis land-forces, and also for that the citie itselfe was but meanely\r\nfortified and easie to overcome, by reason of the citizens' delicacie\r\nand discontinuance from the warres, who, with continuall and constant\r\nlabour, might be vanquished, if they yielded not at the first assault.\"\r\n[Hakluyt's Voyages, vol. i. 601.]\r\n\r\nBut the English and Dutch found ships and mariners enough to keep\r\nthe Armada itself in check, and at the same time to block up Parma's\r\nflotilla. The greater part of Seymour's squadron left its cruising\r\nground off Dunkirk to join the English admiral off Calais; but the Dutch\r\nmanned about five-and-thirty sail of good ships, with a strong force of\r\nsoldiers on board, all well seasoned to the sea-service, and with these\r\nthey blockaded the Flemish ports that were in Parma's power. Still\r\nit was resolved by the Spanish admiral and the prince to endeavour to\r\neffect a junction, which the English seamen were equally resolute to\r\nprevent: and bolder measures on our side now became necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Armada lay off Calais, with its largest ships ranged outside, \"like\r\nstrong castles fearing no assault; the lesser placed in the middle\r\nward.\" The English admiral could not attack them in their position\r\nwithout great disadvantage, but on the night of the 29th he sent\r\neight fire-ships among them, with almost equal effect to that of the\r\nfire-ships which the Greeks so often employed against the Turkish fleets\r\nin their late war of independence. The Spaniards cut their cables\r\nand put to sea in confusion. One of the largest galeasses ran foul of\r\nanother vessel and was stranded. The rest of the fleet was scattered\r\nabout on the Flemish coast, and when the morning broke, it was with\r\ndifficulty and delay that they obeyed their admiral's signal to range\r\nthemselves round him near Gravelines. Now was the golden opportunity\r\nfor the English to assail them, and prevent them from ever letting loose\r\nParma's flotilla against England; and nobly was that opportunity used.\r\nDrake and Fenner were the first English captains who attacked the\r\nunwieldy leviathans: then came Fenton, Southwell, Burton, Cross, Raynor,\r\nand then the lord admiral, with Lord Thomas Howard and Lord Sheffield.\r\nThe Spaniards only thought of forming and keeping close together, and\r\nwere driven by the English past Dunkirk, and far away from the Prince\r\nof Parma, who in watching their defeat from the coast, must, as Drake\r\nexpressed it, have chafed like a bear robbed of her whelps. This was\r\nindeed the last and the decisive battle between the two fleets. It is,\r\nperhaps, best described in the very words of the contemporary writer as\r\nwe may read them in Hakluyt. [Vol. i. p. 602.]\r\n\r\n\"Upon the 29th of July in the morning, the Spanish fleet after the\r\nforsayd tumult, having arranged themselves againe into order, were,\r\nwithin sight of Greveling, most bravely and furiously encountered by\r\nthe English; where they once again got the wind of the Spaniards; who\r\nsuffered themselves to be deprived of the commodity of the place in\r\nCalais road, and of the advantage of the wind neer unto Dunkerk,\r\nrather than they would change their array or separate their forces now\r\nconjoyned and united together, standing only upon their defence.\r\n\r\n\"And howbeit there were many excellent and warlike ships in the English\r\nfleet, yet scarce were there 22 or 23 among them all, which matched 90\r\nof the Spanish ships in the bigness, or could conveniently assault them.\r\nWherefore the English ships using their prerogative of nimble steerage,\r\nwhereby they could turn and wield themselves with the wind which way\r\nthey listed, came often times very near upon the Spaniards, and charged\r\nthem so sore, that now and then they were but a pike's length asunder:\r\nand so continually giving them one broadside after another, they\r\ndischarged all their shot both great and small upon them, spending one\r\nwhole day from morning till night in that violent kind of conflict,\r\nuntill such time as powder and bullets failed them. In regard of which\r\nwant they thought it convenient not to pursue the Spaniards any longer,\r\nbecause they had many great vantages of the English, namely, for the\r\nextraordinary bigness of their ships, and also for that they were so\r\nneerley conjoyned, and kept together in so good array, that they\r\ncould by no meanes be fought withall one to one. The English thought,\r\ntherefore, that they had right well acquitted themselves, in chasing the\r\nSpaniards first from Caleis, and then from Dunkerk, and by that meanes\r\nto have hindered them from joyning with the Duke of Parma his forces,\r\nand getting the wind of them, to have driven them from their own coasts.\r\n\r\n\"The Spaniards that day sustained great loss and damage, having many of\r\ntheir shippes shot thorow and thorow, and they discharged likewise great\r\nstore of ordinance against the English; who, indeed, sustained some\r\nhindrance, but not comparable to the Spaniard's loss: for they lost not\r\nany one ship or person of account, for very diligent inquisition being\r\nmade, the English men all that time wherein the Spanish navy sayled\r\nupon their seas, are not found to have wanted aboue one hundred of their\r\npeople: albeit Sir Francis Drake's ship was pierced with shot above\r\nforty times, and his very cabben was twice shot thorow, and about the\r\nconclusion of the fight, the bed of a certaine gentleman, lying weary\r\nthereupon, was taken quite from under him with the force of a bullet.\r\nLikewise, as the Earle of Northumberland and Sir Charles Blunt were\r\nat dinner upon a time, the bullet of a demy-culverin brake thorow the\r\nmiddest of their cabben, touched their feet, and strooke downe two of\r\nthe standers by, with many such accidents befalling the English shippes,\r\nwhich it were tedious to rehearse.\"\r\n\r\nIt reflects little credit on the English Government that the English\r\nfleet was so deficiently supplied with ammunition, as to be unable to\r\ncomplete the destruction of the invaders. But enough was done to ensure\r\nit. Many of the largest Spanish ships were sunk or captured in the\r\naction of this day. And at length the Spanish admiral, despairing of\r\nsuccess, fled northward with a southerly wind, in the hope of rounding\r\nScotland, and so returning to Spain without a farther encounter with the\r\nEnglish fleet. Lord Effingham left a squadron to continue the blockade\r\nof the Prince of Parma's armament; but that wise general soon\r\nwithdrew his troops to more promising fields of action. Meanwhile the\r\nlord-admiral himself and Drake chased the vincible Armada, as it was now\r\ntermed, for some distance northward; and then, when it seemed to bend\r\naway from the Scotch coast towards Norway, it was thought best, in the\r\nwords of Drake, \"to leave them to those boisterous and uncouth northern\r\nseas.\"\r\n\r\nThe sufferings and losses which the unhappy Spaniards sustained in their\r\nflight round Scotland and Ireland, are well known. Of their whole Armada\r\nonly fifty-three shattered vessels brought back their beaten and wasted\r\ncrews to the Spanish coast which they had quitted in such pageantry and\r\npride.\r\n\r\nSome passages from the writings of those who took part in the struggle,\r\nhave been already quoted; and the most spirited description of the\r\ndefeat of the Armada which ever was penned, may perhaps be taken from\r\nthe letter which our brave vice-admiral Drake wrote in answer to some\r\nmendacious stories by which the Spaniards strove to hide their shame.\r\nThus does he describe the scenes in which he played so important a part:\r\n[See Strypo, and the notes to the Life of Drake, in the \"Biographia\r\nBritannica.\"]\r\n\r\n\"They were not ashamed to publish, in sundry languages in print, great\r\nvictories in words, which they pretended to have obtained against\r\nthis realm, and spread the same in a most false sort over all parts of\r\nFrance, Italy, and elsewhere; when, shortly afterwards, it was happily\r\nmanifested in very deed to all nations, how their navy, which they\r\ntermed invincible, consisting of one hundred and forty sail of ships,\r\nnot only of their own kingdom, but strengthened with the greatest\r\nargosies, Portugal carracks, Florentines, and large hulks of other\r\ncountries, were by thirty of her majesty's own ships of war, and a few\r\nof our own merchants, by the wise, valiant, and advantageous conduct of\r\nthe Lord Charles Howard, high-admiral of England, beaten and shuffled\r\ntogether even from the Lizard in Cornwall, first to Portland, when they\r\nshamefully left Don Pedro de Valdez with his mighty ship; from Portland\r\nto Calais, where they lost Hugh de Moncado, with the galleys of which he\r\nwas captain; and from Calais driven with squibs from their anchors, were\r\nchased out of the sight of England, round about Scotland and Ireland.\r\nWhere, for the sympathy of their religion, hoping to find succour and\r\nassistance, a great part of them were crushed against the rocks,\r\nand those others that landed, being very many in number, were,\r\nnotwithstanding, broken, slain, and taken; and so sent from village\r\nto village, coupled in halters, to be shipped into England, where her\r\nmajesty, of her princely and invincible disposition, disdaining to put\r\nthem to death, and scorning either to retain or to entertain them, they\r\nwere all sent back again to their countries, to witness and recount the\r\nworthy achievement of their invincible and dreadful navy. Of which the\r\nnumber of soldiers, the fearful burthen of their ships, the commanders'\r\nnames of every squadron, with all others, their magazines of provision\r\nwere put in print, as an army and navy irresistible and disdaining\r\nprevention: with all which their great and terrible ostentation, they\r\ndid not in all their sailing round about England so much as sink or take\r\none ship, bark, pinnace, or cockboat of ours, or even burn so much as\r\none sheep-cote on this land.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF EVENTS BETWEEN THE DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA, A.D. 1588;\r\nAND THE BATTLE OF BLENHEIM, A.D. 1704.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1594.

If tested by the amount of permanent\r\naggrandisement which each procured for France, the ambition of the royal\r\nBourbon was more successful than were the enterprises of the imperial\r\nCorsican. All the provinces that Bonaparte conquered, were rent again\r\nfrom France within twenty years from the date when the very earliest of\r\nthem was acquired. France is not stronger by a single city or a single\r\nacre for all the devastating wars of the Consulate and the Empire. But\r\nshe still possesses Franche-Comte, Alsace, and part of Flanders. She has\r\nstill the extended boundaries which Louis XIV. gave her. And the royal\r\nSpanish marriages, a few years ago, proved clearly how enduring has\r\nbeen the political influence which the arts and arms of France's \"Grand\r\nMonarque\" obtained for her southward of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nWhen Louis XIV. took the reins of government into his own hands,\r\nafter the death of Cardinal Mazarin, there was a union of ability with\r\nopportunity, such as France had not seen since the days of Charlemagne.\r\nMoreover, Louis's career was no brief one. For upwards of forty years,\r\nfor a period nearly equal to the duration of Charlemagne's reign, Louis\r\nsteadily followed an aggressive and a generally successful policy. He\r\npassed a long youth and manhood of triumph, before the military genius\r\nof Marlborough made him acquainted with humiliation and defeat. The\r\ngreat Bourbon lived too long. He should not have outstayed our two\r\nEnglish kings--one his dependent, James II., the other his antagonist,\r\nWilliam III. Had he died in the year within which they died, his reign\r\nwould be cited as unequalled in the French annals for its prosperity.\r\nBut he lived on to see his armies beaten, his cities captured, and his\r\nkingdom wasted by disastrous war. It is as if Charlemagne had survived\r\nto be defeated by the Northmen, and to witness the misery and shame that\r\nactually fell to the lot of his descendants.\r\n\r\nStill, Louis XIV. had forty years of success; and from the permanence of\r\ntheir fruits we may judge what the results would have been if the last\r\nfifteen years of his reign had been equally fortunate. Had it not been\r\nfor Blenheim, all Europe might at this day suffer under the effect of\r\nFrench conquests resembling those of Alexander in extent, and those of\r\nthe Romans in durability.\r\n\r\nWhen Louis XIV. began to govern, he found all the materials for a\r\nstrong government ready to his hand. Richelieu had completely tamed the\r\nturbulent spirit of the French nobility, and had subverted the \"imperium\r\nin imperio\" of the Huguenots. The faction of the Frondeurs in Mazarin's\r\ntime had had the effect of making the Parisian parliament utterly\r\nhateful and contemptible in the eyes of the nation. The assemblies of\r\nthe States-General were obsolete. The royal authority alone remained.\r\nThe King was the State. Louis knew his position. He fearlessly avowed\r\nit, and he fearlessly acted up to it. [\"Quand Louis XIV. dit, 'L'etat,\r\nc'est moi:' il n'y eut dans cette parole ni enflure, ni vanterie, mais\r\nla simple enonciation d'un fait.\"--MICHELET, HISTOIRE MODERNE vol. ii.\r\np. 106.]\r\n\r\nNot only was his government a strong one, but the country which he\r\ngoverned was strong: strong in its geographical situation, in the\r\ncompactness of its territory, in the number and martial spirit of its\r\ninhabitants, and in their complete and undivided nationality. Louis had\r\nneither a Hungary nor an Ireland in his dominions, and it was not till\r\nlate in his reign, when old age had made his bigotry more gloomy, and\r\nhad given fanaticism the mastery over prudence, that his persecuting\r\nintolerance caused the civil war in the Cevennes.\r\n\r\nLike Napoleon in after-times, Louis XIV. saw clearly that the great\r\nwants of France were \"ships, colonies, and commerce.\" But Louis did\r\nmore than see these wants: by the aid of his great minister, Colbert, he\r\nsupplied them. One of the surest proofs of the genius of Louis was his\r\nskill in finding out genius in others, and his promptness in calling it\r\ninto action. Under him, Louvois organized, Turenne, Conde, Villars and\r\nBerwick, led the armies of France; and Vauban fortified her frontiers.\r\nThroughout his reign, French diplomacy was marked by skilfulness\r\nand activity, and also by comprehensive far-sightedness, such as the\r\nrepresentatives of no other nation possessed. Guizot's testimony to\r\nthe vigour that was displayed through every branch of Louis XIV.'s\r\ngovernment, and to the extent to which France at present is indebted to\r\nhim, is remarkable. He says, that, \"taking the public services of every\r\nkind, the finances, the departments of roads and public works, the\r\nmilitary administration, and all the establishments which belong to\r\nevery branch of administration, there is not one that will not be found\r\nto have had its origin, its development, or its greatest perfection,\r\nunder the reign of Louis XIV.\" [History of European Civilization,\r\nLecture 13.] And he points out to us, that \"the government of Louis XIV.\r\nwas the first that presented itself to the eyes of Europe as a power\r\nacting upon sure grounds, which had not to dispute its existence with\r\ninward enemies, but was at ease as to its territory and its people, and\r\nsolely occupied with the task of administering government, properly so\r\ncalled. All the European governments had been previously thrown into\r\nincessant wars, which deprived them of all security as well as of all\r\nleisure, or so harassed by internal parties or antagonists, that their\r\ntime was passed in fighting for existence. The government of Louis XIV.\r\nwas the first to appear as a busy thriving administration of affairs,\r\nas a power at once definitive and progressive, which was not afraid to\r\ninnovate, because it could reckon securely on the future. There have\r\nbeen in fact very few governments equally innovating. Compare it with\r\na government of the same nature, the unmixed monarchy of Philip II. in\r\nSpain; it was more absolute than that of Louis XIV., and yet it was far\r\nless regular and tranquil. How did Philip II. succeed in establishing\r\nabsolute power in Spain? By stifling all activity in the country,\r\nopposing himself to every species of amelioration, and rendering the\r\nstate of Spain completely stagnant. The government of Louis XIV., on the\r\ncontrary, exhibited alacrity for all sorts of innovations, and showed\r\nitself favourable to the progress of letters, arts, wealth in short,\r\nof civilization. This was the veritable cause of its preponderance\r\nin Europe, which arose to such a pitch, that it became the type of\r\na government not only to sovereigns, but also to nations, during the\r\nseventeenth century.\"\r\n\r\nWhile France was thus strong and united in herself, and ruled by a\r\nmartial, an ambitious, and (with all his faults) an enlightened and\r\nhigh-spirited sovereign, what European power was there fit to cope with\r\nher, or keep her in check?\r\n\r\n\"As to Germany, the ambitious projects of the German branch of Austria\r\nhad been entirely defeated, the peace of the empire had been restored,\r\nand almost a new constitution formed, or an old revived, by the treaties\r\nof Westphalia; NAY, THE IMPERIAL EAGLE WAS NOT ONLY FALLEN, BUT HER\r\nWINGS WERE CLIPPED.\" [Bolingbroke, vol. ii. p. 378. Lord Bolingbroke's\r\n\"Letters on the Use of History,\" and his \"Sketch of the History\r\nand State of Europe,\" abound with remarks on Louis XIV. and his\r\ncontemporaries, of which the substance is as sound as the style is\r\nbeautiful. Unfortunately, like all his other works, they contain also\r\na large proportion of sophistry and misrepresentation. The best test\r\nto use before we adopt any opinion or assertion of Bolingbroke's, is\r\nto consider whether in writing it he was thinking either of Sir Robert\r\nWalpole or of Revealed Religion. When either of these objects of his\r\nhatred was before his mind, he scrupled at no artifice or exaggeration\r\nthat; might serve the purpose of his malignity. On most other occasions\r\nhe may be followed with advantage, as he always may be read with\r\npleasure.]\r\n\r\n\"As to Spain, the Spanish branch of the Austrian house had sunk equally\r\nlow. Philip II. left his successors a ruined monarchy. He left them\r\nsomething worse; he left them his example and his principles of\r\ngovernment, founded in ambition, in pride, in ignorance, in bigotry, and\r\nall the pedantry of state.\" [Bolingbroke, vol. ii. p. 378.]\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, to be wondered at, that France, in the first war\r\nof Louis XIV., despised the opposition of both branches of the once\r\npredominant house of Austria. Indeed, in Germany the French king\r\nacquired allies among the princes of the Empire against the emperor\r\nhimself. He had a still stronger support in Austria's misgovernment of\r\nher own subjects. The words of Bolingbroke on this are remarkable,\r\nand some of them sound as if written within the last three years.\r\nBolingbroke says, \"It was not merely the want of cordial co-operation\r\namong the princes of the Empire that disabled the emperor from acting\r\nwith vigour in the cause of his family then, nor that has rendered the\r\nhouse of Austria a dead weight upon all her allies ever since. Bigotry,\r\nand its inseparable companion, cruelty, as well as the tyranny\r\nand avarice of the court of Vienna, created in those days, and has\r\nmaintained in ours, almost a perpetual diversion of the imperial arms\r\nfrom all effectual opposition to France. I MEAN TO SPEAK OF THE TROUBLES\r\nIN HUNGARY. WHATEVER THEY BECAME IN THEIR PROGRESS, THEY WERE CAUSED\r\nORIGINALLY BY THE USERPATIONS AND PERSECUTIONS OF THE EMPEROR; AND WHEN\r\nTHE HUNGARIANS WERE CALLED REBELS FIRST, THEY WERE CALLED SO FOR NO\r\nOTHER REASON THAN THIS, THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE SLAVES. The dominion of\r\nthe emperor being less supportable than that of the Turks, this unhappy\r\npeople opened a door to the latter to infest the empire, instead of\r\nmaking their country, what it had been before, a barrier against the\r\nOttoman power. France became a sure though secret ally of the Turks, as\r\nwell as the Hungarians, and has found her account in it, by keeping\r\nthe emperor in perpetual alarms on that side, while she has ravaged the\r\nEmpire and the Low Countries on the other.\" [Bolingbroke, vol. ii. p.\r\n397.]\r\n\r\nIf, after having seen the imbecility of Germany and Spain against the\r\nFrance of Louis XIV., we turn to the two only remaining European powers\r\nof any importance at that time, to England and to Holland, we find the\r\nposition of our own country as to European politics, from 1660 to 1688,\r\nmost painful to contemplate. From 1660 to 1688, \"England, by the return\r\nof the Stuarts, was reduced to a nullity.\" The words are Michelet's,\r\n[Histoire Moderne, vol. ii. p.106.] and though severe they are just.\r\nThey are, in fact, not severe enough: for when England, under her\r\nrestored dynasty of the Stuarts, did take any part in European politics,\r\nher conduct, or rather her king's conduct, was almost invariably wicked\r\nand dishonourable.\r\n\r\nBolingbroke rightly says that, \"previous to the Revolution of 1688,\r\nduring the whole progress that Louis XIV. made in obtaining such\r\nexorbitant power, as gave him well-grounded hopes of acquiring at last\r\nto his family the Spanish monarchy, England had been either an idle\r\nspectator of what passed on the continent, or a faint and uncertain\r\nally against France, or a warm and sure ally on her side, or a partial\r\nmediator between her and the powers confederated together in their\r\ncommon defence. But though the court of England submitted to abet\r\nthe usurpations of France, and the King of England stooped to be her\r\npensioner, the crime was not national. On the contrary, the nation cried\r\nout loudly against it even whilst it was being committed.\" [Bolingbroke,\r\nvol. ii p. 418.]\r\n\r\nHolland alone, of all the European powers, opposed from the very\r\nbeginning a steady and uniform resistance to the ambition and power of\r\nthe French king. It was against Holland that the fiercest attacks of\r\nFrance were made, and though often apparently on the eve of complete\r\nsuccess, they were always ultimately baffled by the stubborn bravery of\r\nthe Dutch, and the heroism of their leader, William of Orange. When he\r\nbecame king of England, the power of this country was thrown decidedly\r\ninto the scale against France; but though the contest was thus rendered\r\nless unequal, though William acted throughout \"with invincible firmness,\r\nlike a patriot and a hero,\" [Bolingbroke, vol, ii, p.404.] France\r\nhad the general superiority in every war and in every treaty: and the\r\ncommencement of the eighteenth century found the last league against her\r\ndissolved, all the forces of the confederates against her dispersed, and\r\nmany disbanded; while France continued armed, with her veteran forces\r\nby sea and land increased, and held in readiness to act on all sides,\r\nwhenever the opportunity should arise for seizing on the great prizes\r\nwhich, from the very beginning of his reign, had never been lost sight\r\nof by her king.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place for any narrative of the first essay which Louis\r\nXIV. made of his power in the war of 1667; of his rapid conquest of\r\nFlanders and Franche-Comte; of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which\r\n\"was nothing more than a composition between the bully and the bullied;\"\r\n[Ibid p. 399.] of his attack on Holland in 1672; of the districts and\r\nbarrier-towns of the Spanish Netherlands which were secured to him by\r\nthe treaty of Nimeguen in 1678; of how, after this treaty, he \"continued\r\nto vex both Spain and the Empire, and to extend his conquests in the Low\r\nCountries and on the Rhine, both by the pen and the sword; how he took\r\nLuxembourg by force, stole Strasburg, and bought Casal;\" of how the\r\nleague of Augsburg was formed against him in 1686, and the election of\r\nWilliam of Orange to the English throne in 1688, gave a new spirit to\r\nthe opposition which France encountered; of the long and chequered war\r\nthat followed, in which the French armies were generally victorious\r\non the continent, though his fleet was beaten at La Hogue, and his\r\ndependent, James II,, was defeated at the Boyne, or of the treaty of\r\nRyswick, which left France in possession of Roussillon, Artois, and\r\nStrasburg, which gave Europe no security against her claims on the\r\nSpanish succession, and which Louis regarded as a mere truce, to gain\r\nbreathing-time before a more decisive struggle. It must be borne in\r\nmind that the ambition of Louis in these wars was twofold. It had its\r\nimmediate and its ulterior objects. Its immediate object was to conquer\r\nand annex to France the neighbouring provinces and towns that were most\r\nconvenient for the increase of her strength; but the ulterior object of\r\nLouis, from the time of his marriage to the Spanish Infanta in 1659, was\r\nto acquire for the house of Bourbon the whole empire of Spain. A formal\r\nrenunciation of all right to the Spanish succession had been made at the\r\ntime of the marriage; but such renunciations were never of any practical\r\neffect, and many casuists and jurists of the age even held them to be\r\nintrinsically void, as time passed on, and the prospect of Charles II.\r\nof Spain dying without lineal heirs became more and more certain, so did\r\nthe claims of the house of Bourbon to the Spanish crown after his death\r\nbecome matters of urgent interest to French ambition on the one hand,\r\nand to the other powers of Europe on the other. At length the unhappy\r\nKing of Spain died. By his will he appointed Philip, Duke of Anjou, one\r\nof Louis XIV.'s grandsons, to succeed him on the throne of Spain, and\r\nstrictly forbade any partition of his dominions. Louis well knew that a\r\ngeneral European war would follow if he accepted for his house the crown\r\nthus bequeathed. But he had been preparing for this crisis throughout\r\nhis reign. He sent his grandson into Spain as King Philip V. of that\r\ncountry, addressing to him on his departure the memorable words, \"There\r\nare no longer any Pyrenees.\"\r\n\r\nThe empire, which now received the grandson of Louis as its king,\r\ncomprised, besides Spain itself, the strongest part of the Netherlands,\r\nSardinia, Sicily, Naples, the principality of Milan, and other\r\npossessions in Italy, the Philippines and Marilla Islands in Asia, and,\r\nin the New World, besides California and Florida the greatest part of\r\nCentral and of Southern America. Philip was well received in Madrid,\r\nwhere he was crowned as King Philip V. in the beginning of 1701. The\r\ndistant portions of his empire sent in their adhesion; and the house of\r\nBourbon, either by its French or Spanish troops, now had occupation both\r\nof the kingdom of Francis I., and of the fairest and amplest portion of\r\nthe empire of the great rival of Francis, Charles V.\r\n\r\nLoud was the wrath of Austria, whose princes were the rival claimants of\r\nthe Bourbons for the empire of Spain. The indignation of William\r\nIII., though not equally loud, was far more deep and energetic. By\r\nhis exertions a league against the house of Bourbon was formed between\r\nEngland, Holland, and the Austrian Emperor, which was subsequently\r\njoined by the kings of Portugal and Prussia, by the Duke of Savoy, and\r\nby Denmark. Indeed, the alarm throughout Europe was now general and\r\nurgent. It was clear that Louis aimed a consolidating France and the\r\nSpanish dominions into one preponderating empire. At the moment when\r\nPhilip was departing to take possession of Spain, Louis had issued\r\nletters-patent in his favour to the effect of preserving his rights to\r\nthe throne of France. And Louis had himself obtained possession of\r\nthe important frontier of the Spanish Netherlands, with its numerous\r\nfortified cities, which were given up to his troops under pretence of\r\nsecuring them for the young King of Spain. Whether the formal union of\r\nthe two crowns was likely to take place speedily or not, it was evident\r\nthat the resources of the whole Spanish monarchy were now virtually at\r\nthe French king's disposal.\r\n\r\nThe peril that seemed to menace the empire, England, Holland, and\r\nthe other independent powers, is well summed up by Alison: \"Spain had\r\nthreatened the liberties of Europe in the end of the sixteenth century,\r\nFrance had all but overthrown them in the close of the seventeenth.\r\nWhat hope was there of their being able to make head against them both,\r\nunited under such a monarch as Louis XIV.?\" [Military History of the\r\nDuke of Marlborough, p. 32.]\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the decayed state into which the Spanish power had\r\nfallen, ought not to make us regard their alarms as chimerical. Spain\r\npossessed enormous resources, and her strength was capable of being\r\nregenerated by a vigorous ruler. We should remember what Alberoni\r\neffected, even after the close of the War of Succession. By what that\r\nminister did in a few years, we may judge what Louis XIV. would have\r\ndone in restoring the maritime and military power of that great country\r\nwhich nature has so largely gifted, and which man's misgovernment has so\r\ndebased.\r\n\r\nThe death of King William on the 8th of March, 1702, at first seemed\r\nlikely to paralyse the league against France, for \"notwithstanding the\r\nill-success with which he made war generally, he was looked upon as the\r\nsole centre of union that could keep together the great confederacy then\r\nforming; and how much the French feared from his life, had appeared a\r\nfew years before, in the extravagant and indecent joy they expressed on\r\na false report of his death. A short time showed how vain the fears of\r\nsome, and the hopes of others were.\" [Bolingbroke, vol. ii. p. 445.]\r\nQueen Anne, within three days after her accession, went down to the\r\nHouse of Lords, and there declared her resolution to support the\r\nmeasures planned by her predecessor, who had been \"the great support,\r\nnot only of these kingdoms, but of all Europe.\" Anne was married to\r\nPrince George of Denmark, and by her accession to the English throne the\r\nconfederacy against Louis obtained the aid of the troops of Denmark; but\r\nAnne's strong attachment to one of her female friends led to far\r\nmore important advantages to the anti-Gallican confederacy, than the\r\nacquisition of many armies, for it gave them MARLBOROUGH as their\r\nCaptain-General.\r\n\r\nThere are few successful commanders on whom Fame has shone so\r\nunwillingly as upon John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, Prince of\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire,--victor of Blenheim, Ramilies, Oudenarde, and\r\nMalplaquet,--captor of Liege, Bonn, Limburg, Landau, Ghent, Bruges,\r\nAntwerp, Oudenarde, Ostend, Menin, Dendermonde, Ath, Lille, Tourney,\r\nMons, Douay, Aire, Bethune, and Bouchain; who never fought a battle\r\nthat he did not win, and never besieged a place that he did not take.\r\nMarlborough's own private character is the cause of this. Military glory\r\nmay, and too often does, dazzle both contemporaries and posterity, until\r\nthe crimes as well as the vices of heroes are forgotten. But even a few\r\nstains of personal meanness will dim a soldier's reputation irreparably;\r\nand Marlborough's faults were of a peculiarly base and mean order. Our\r\nfeelings towards historical personages are in this respect like our\r\nfeelings towards private acquaintances. There are actions of that shabby\r\nnature, that, however much they may be outweighed by a man's good deeds\r\non a general estimate of his character, we never can feel any cordial\r\nliking for the person who has been guilty of them. Thus, with respect to\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough, it goes against our feelings to admire the man,\r\nwho owed his first advancement in life to the court-favour which he and\r\nhis family acquired through his sister becoming one of the mistresses\r\nof the Duke of York. It is repulsive to know that Marlborough laid the\r\nfoundation of his wealth by being the paid lover of one of the fair and\r\nfrail favourites of Charles II. His treachery and ingratitude to his\r\npatron and benefactor, James II., stand out in dark relief, even in\r\nthat age of thankless perfidy. He was almost equally disloyal to his new\r\nmaster, King William; and a more un-English act cannot be recorded than\r\nGodolphin's and Marlborough's betrayal to the French court in 1694 of\r\nthe expedition then designed against Brest, an act of treason which\r\ncaused some hundreds of English soldiers and sailors to be helplessly\r\nslaughtered on the beach in Camaret Bay.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, only in his military career that we have now to consider\r\nhim; and there are very few generals, of either ancient or modern times,\r\nwhose campaigns will bear a comparison with those of Marlborough, either\r\nfor the masterly skill with which they were planned, or for the bold\r\nyet prudent energy with which each plan was carried into execution.\r\nMarlborough had served while young under Turenne, and had obtained the\r\nmarked praise of that great tactician. It would be difficult, indeed,\r\nto name a single quality which a general ought to have, and with which\r\nMarlborough was not eminently gifted. What principally attracted the\r\nnotice of contemporaries, was the imperturbable evenness of his spirit.\r\nVoltaire [Siecle de Louis Quatorze.] says of him:--\"He had, to a degree\r\nabove all other generals of his time, that calm courage in the midst of\r\ntumult, that serenity of soul in danger, which the English call a COOL\r\nHEAD (que les Anglais appellant COOL HEAD, TETE FROID), and it was\r\nperhaps this quality, the greatest gift of nature for command, which\r\nformerly gave the English so many advantages over the French in the\r\nplains of Cressy, Poictiers, and Agincourt.\"\r\n\r\nKing William's knowledge of Marlborough's high abilities, though he knew\r\nhis faithlessness equally well, is said to have caused that sovereign\r\nin his last illness to recommend Marlborough to his successor as the\r\nfittest person to command her armies: but Marlborough's favour with\r\nthe new queen by means of his wife was so high, that he was certain of\r\nobtaining the highest employment: and the war against Louis opened to\r\nhim a glorious theatre for the display of those military talents, which\r\nhe had before only had an opportunity of exercising in a subordinate\r\ncharacter, and on far less conspicuous scenes.\r\n\r\nHe was not only made captain-general of the English forces at home and\r\nabroad, but such was the authority of England in the council of the\r\nGrand Alliance, and Marlborough was so skilled in winning golden\r\nopinions from all whom he met with, that, on his reaching the Hague, he\r\nwas received with transports of joy by the Dutch, and it was agreed\r\nby the heads of that republic, and the minister of the emperor, that\r\nMarlborough should have the chief command of all the allied armies.\r\n\r\nIt must indeed, in justice to Marlborough, be borne in mind, that mere\r\nmilitary skill was by no means all that was required of him in this\r\narduous and invidious station. Had it not been for his unrivalled\r\npatience and sweetness of temper, and his marvellous ability in\r\ndiscerning the character of those with whom he had to act, his intuitive\r\nperception of those who were to be thoroughly trusted, and of those\r\nwho were to be amused with the mere semblance of respect and\r\nconfidence,--had not Marlborough possessed and employed, while at the\r\nhead of the allied armies, all the qualifications of a polished courtier\r\nand a great statesman, he never would have led the allied armies to the\r\nDanube. The Confederacy would not have held together for a single year.\r\nHis great political adversary, Bolingbroke, does him ample justice here.\r\nBolingbroke, after referring to the loss which King William's death\r\nseemed to inflict on the cause of the Allies, observes that, \"By his\r\ndeath the Duke of Marlborough was raised to the head of the army, and,\r\nindeed, of the Confederacy; where he, a new, a private man, a subject,\r\nacquired by merit and by management, a more deciding influence, than\r\nhigh birth, confirmed authority, and even the crown of Great Britain,\r\nhad given to King William. Not only all the parts of that vast machine,\r\nthe Grand Alliance, were kept more compact and entire; but a more rapid\r\nand vigorous motion was given to the whole; and instead of languishing\r\nand disastrous campaigns, we saw every scene of the war full of action.\r\nAll those wherein he appeared and many of those wherein he was not then\r\nan actor, but abettor, however, of their action, were crowned with the\r\nmost triumphant success.\r\n\r\n\"I take with pleasure this opportunity of doing justice to that great\r\nman, whose faults I knew, whose virtues I admired; and whose memory, as\r\nthe greatest general and as the greatest minister that our country, or\r\nperhaps any other, has produced, I honour.\" [Bolingbroke, vol. ii. p.\r\n445.]\r\n\r\nWar, was formally declared by the allies against France on the 4th\r\nof May, 1702. The principal scenes of its operation were, at first,\r\nFlanders, the Upper Rhine, and North Italy. Marlborough headed the\r\nallied troops in Flanders during the first two years of the war, and\r\ntook some towns from the enemy, but nothing decisive occurred. Nor did\r\nany actions of importance take place during this period, between the\r\nrival armies in Italy. But in the centre of that line from north to\r\nsouth, from the mouth of the Scheldt to the mouth of the Po, along which\r\nthe war was carried on, the generals of Louis XIV. acquired advantages\r\nin 1703, which threatened one chief member of the Grand Alliance with\r\nutter destruction. France had obtained the important assistance of\r\nBavaria, as her confederate in the war. The Elector of this powerful\r\nGerman state made himself master of the strong fortress of Ulm, and\r\nopened a communication with the French armies on the Upper Rhine. By\r\nthis junction, the troops of Louis were enabled to assail the Emperor in\r\nthe very heart of Germany. In the autumn of the year 1703, the\r\ncombined armies of the Elector and French king completely defeated\r\nthe Imperialists in Bavaria; and in the following winter they made\r\nthemselves masters of the important cities of Augsburg and Passau.\r\nMeanwhile the French army of the Upper Rhine and Moselle had beaten the\r\nallied armies opposed to them, and taken Treves and Landau. At the same\r\ntime the discontents in Hungary with Austria again broke out into open\r\ninsurrection, so as to distract the attention, and complete the terror\r\nof the Emperor and his council at Vienna.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. ordered the next campaign to be commenced by his troops on\r\na scale of grandeur and with a boldness of enterprise, such as even\r\nNapoleon's military schemes have seldom equalled. On the extreme left of\r\nthe line of the war, in the Netherlands, the French armies were to act\r\nonly on the defensive. The fortresses in the hands of the French there,\r\nwere so many and so strong that no serious impression seemed likely to\r\nbe made by the Allies on the French frontier in that quarter during\r\none campaign; and that one campaign was to give France such triumphs\r\nelsewhere as would (it was hoped) determine the war. Large detachments\r\nwere, therefore, to be made from the French force in Flanders, and they\r\nwere to be led by Marshal Villeroy to the Moselle and Upper Rhine. The\r\nFrench army already in the neighbourhood of those rivers was to march\r\nunder Marshal Tallard through the Black Forest, and join the Elector of\r\nBavaria and the French troops that were already with the Elector under\r\nMarshal Marsin. Meanwhile the French army of Italy was to advance\r\nthrough the Tyrol into Austria, and the whole forces were to combine\r\nbetween the Danube and the Inn. A strong body of troops was to be\r\ndespatched into Hungary, to assist and organize the insurgents in that\r\nkingdom; and the French grand army of the Danube was then, in collected\r\nand irresistible might, to march upon Vienna, and dictate terms of peace\r\nto the Emperor. High military genius was shown in the formation of this\r\nplan, but it was met and baffled by a genius higher still.\r\n\r\nMarlborough had watched, with the deepest anxiety, the progress of the\r\nFrench arms on the Rhine and in Bavaria, and he saw the futility of\r\ncarrying on a war of posts and sieges in Flanders, while death-blows to\r\nthe empire were being dealt on the Danube. He resolved therefore to let\r\nthe war in Flanders languish for a year, while he moved with all\r\nthe disposable forces that he could collect to the central scenes\r\nof decisive operations. Such a march was in itself difficult, but\r\nMarlborough had, in the first instance, to overcome the still greater\r\ndifficulty of obtaining the consent and cheerful co-operation of the\r\nAllies, especially of the Dutch, whose frontier it was proposed thus\r\nto deprive of the larger part of the force which had hitherto been its\r\nprotection. Fortunately, among the many slothful, the many foolish, the\r\nmany timid, and the not few treacherous rulers, statesmen, and generals\r\nof different nations with whom he had to deal, there were two\r\nmen, eminent both in ability and integrity, who entered fully into\r\nMarlborough's projects, and who, from the stations which they occupied,\r\nwere enabled materially to forward them. One of these was the Dutch\r\nstatesman Heinsius, who had been the cordial supporter of King William,\r\nand who now, with equal zeal and good faith, supported Marlborough in\r\nthe councils of the Allies; the other was the celebrated general\r\nPrince Eugene, whom the Austrian cabinet had recalled from the Italian\r\nfrontier, to take the command of one of the Emperor's armies in Germany.\r\nTo these two great men, and a few more, Marlborough communicated his\r\nplan freely and unreservedly; but to the general councils of his allies\r\nhe only disclosed part, of his daring scheme. He proposed to the Dutch\r\nthat he should march from Flanders to the Upper Rhine and Moselle, with\r\nthe British troops and part of the Foreign auxiliaries, and commence\r\nvigorous operations against the French armies in that quarter,\r\nwhilst General Auverquerque, with the Dutch and the remainder of the\r\nauxiliaries, maintained a defensive war in the Netherlands. Having with\r\ndifficulty obtained the consent of the Dutch to this portion of his\r\nproject, he exercised the same diplomatic zeal, with the same success,\r\nin urging the King of Prussia, and other princes of the empire, to\r\nincrease the number of the troops which they supplied, and to post them\r\nin places convenient for his own intended movements.\r\n\r\nMarlborough commenced his celebrated march on the 19th of May. The\r\narmy, which he was to lead, had been assembled by his brother, General\r\nChurchill, at Bedburg, not far from Maestricht on the Meuse: it included\r\nsixteen thousand English troops, and consisted of fifty-one battalions\r\nof foot, and ninety-two squadrons of horse. Marlborough was to collect\r\nand join with him on his march the troops of Prussia, Luneburg, and\r\nHesse, quartered on the Rhine, and eleven Dutch battalions that were\r\nstationed at Rothweil. [Coxe's Life of Marlborough.] He had only\r\nmarched a single day, when the series of interruptions, complaints, and\r\nrequisitions from the other leaders of the Allies began, to which he\r\nseemed doomed throughout his enterprise, and which would have caused\r\nits failure in the hands of any one not gifted with the firmness and the\r\nexquisite temper of Marlborough. One specimen of these annoyances and of\r\nMarlborough's mode of dealing with them may suffice. On his encamping\r\nat Kupen, on the 20th, he received an express from Auverquerque\r\npressing him to halt, because Villeroy, who commanded the French army\r\nin Flanders, had quitted the lines, which he had been occupying, and\r\ncrossed the Meuse at Namur with thirty-six battalions and forty-five\r\nsquadrons, and was threatening the town of Huys. At the same time\r\nMarlborough received letters from the Margrave of Baden and Count\r\nWratislaw, who commanded the Imperialist forces at Stollhoffen near the\r\nleft bank of the Rhine, stating that Tallard had made a movement, as if\r\nintending to cross the Rhine, and urging him to hasten his march\r\ntowards the lines of Stollhoffen. Marlborough was not diverted by these\r\napplications from the prosecution of his grand design. Conscious that\r\nthe army of Villeroy would be too much reduced to undertake offensive\r\noperations, by the detachments which had already been made towards the\r\nRhine, and those which must follow his own march, he halted only a day\r\nto quiet the alarms of Auverquerque. To satisfy also the margrave he\r\nordered the troops of Hompesch and Bulow to draw towards Philipsburg,\r\nthough with private injunctions not to proceed beyond a certain\r\ndistance. He even exacted a promise to the same effect from Count\r\nWratislaw, who at this juncture arrived at the camp to attend him during\r\nthe whole campaign. [Coxe.]\r\n\r\nMarlborough reached the Rhine at Coblentz, where he crossed that river,\r\nand then marched along its right bank to Broubach and Mentz. His march,\r\nthough rapid, was admirably conducted, so as to save the troops from all\r\nunnecessary fatigue; ample supplies of provisions were ready, and the\r\nmost perfect discipline was maintained. By degrees Marlborough obtained\r\nmore reinforcements from the Dutch and the other confederates, and he\r\nalso was left more at liberty by them to follow his own course. Indeed,\r\nbefore even a blow was struck, his enterprise had paralysed the enemy,\r\nand had materially relieved Austria from the pressure of the war.\r\nVilleroy, with his detachments from the French-Flemish army, was\r\ncompletely bewildered by Marlborough's movements; and, unable to divine\r\nwhere it was that the English general meant to strike his blow, wasted\r\naway the early part of the summer between Flanders and the Moselle\r\nwithout effecting anything. [\"Marshal Villeroy,\" says Voltaire, \"who had\r\nwished to follow Marlborough on his first marches, suddenly lost sight\r\nof him altogether, and only learned where he really was, on hearing of\r\nhis victory at Donauwert.\"--SIECLE DE LOUIS XIV.]\r\n\r\nMarshal Tallard, who commanded forty-five thousand men at Strasburg, and\r\nwho had been destined by Louis to march early in the year into Bavaria,\r\nthought that Marlborough's march along the Rhine was preliminary to\r\nan attack upon Alsace; and the marshal therefore kept his forty-five\r\nthousand men back in order to support France in that quarter.\r\nMarlborough skilfully encouraged his apprehensions by causing a bridge\r\nto be constructed across the Rhine at Philipsburg, and by making the\r\nLandgrave of Hesse advance his artillery at Manheim, as if for a\r\nsiege of Landau. Meanwhile the Elector of Bavaria and Marshal Marsin,\r\nsuspecting that Marlborough's design might be what it really proved\r\nto be, forbore to press upon the Austrians opposed to them, or to\r\nsend troops into Hungary; and they kept back so as to secure their\r\ncommunications with France. Thus, when Marlborough, at the beginning of\r\nJune, left the Rhine and marched for the Danube, the numerous hostile\r\narmies were uncombined, and unable to check him.\r\n\r\n\"With such skill and science had this enterprise been concerted, that at\r\nthe very moment when it assumed a specific direction, the enemy was no\r\nlonger enabled to render it abortive. As the march was now to be bent\r\ntowards the Danube, notice was given for the Prussians, Palatines, and\r\nHessians, who were stationed on the Rhine, to order their march so as\r\nto join the main body in its progress. At the same time directions\r\nwere sent to accelerate the advance of the Danish auxiliaries, who were\r\nmarching from the Netherlands.\" [Coxe.]\r\n\r\nCrossing the river Neckar, Marlborough marched in a south-eastern\r\ndirection to Mundelshene, where he had his first personal interview with\r\nPrince Eugene, who was destined to be his colleague on so many glorious\r\nfields. Thence, through a difficult and dangerous country, Marlborough\r\ncontinued his march against the Bavarians, whom he encountered on the 2d\r\nof July, on the heights of the Schullenberg near Donauwert. Marlborough\r\nstormed their entrenched camp, crossed the Danube, took several strong\r\nplaces in Bavaria, and made himself completely master of the Elector's\r\ndominions, except the fortified cities of Munich and Augsburg. But the\r\nElector's army, though defeated at Donauwert, was still numerous and\r\nstrong; and at last Marshal Tallard, when thoroughly apprised of the\r\nreal nature of Marlborough's movements, crossed the Rhine. He was\r\nsuffered through the supineness of the German general at Stollhoffen,\r\nto march without loss through the Black Forest, and united his powerful\r\narmy at Biberach near Augsburg, with that of the Elector and the French\r\ntroops under Marshal Marsin, who had previously been co-operating with\r\nthe Bavarians. On the other hand, Marlborough re-crossed the Danube, and\r\non the 11th of August united his army with the Imperialist forces under\r\nPrince Eugene. The combined armies occupied a position near Hochstadt,\r\na little higher up the left bank of the Danube than Donauwert, the scene\r\nof Marlborough's recent victory, and almost exactly on the ground where\r\nMarshal Villars and the Elector had defeated an Austrian army in the\r\npreceding year. The French marshals and the Elector were now in position\r\na little farther to the east, between Blenheim and Lutzingen, and\r\nwith the little stream of the Nebel between them and the troops of\r\nMarlborough and Eugene. The Gallo-Bavarian army consisted of about sixty\r\nthousand men, and they had sixty-one pieces of artillery. \"The army of\r\nthe Allies was about fifty-six thousand strong, with fifty-two guns.\" [A\r\nshort time before the War of the Succession the musquet and bayonet\r\nhad been made the arms of all the French infantry. It had formerly been\r\nusual to mingle pike-men with musqueteers. The other European nations\r\nfollowed the example of France, and the weapons used at Blenheim were\r\nsubstantially the same as those still employed.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the French army of Italy had been unable to penetrate into\r\nAustria, and although the masterly strategy of Marlborough had hitherto\r\nwarded off the destruction with which the cause of the Allies seemed\r\nmenaced at the beginning of the campaign, the peril was still most\r\nserious. It was absolutely necessary for Marlborough to attack the\r\nenemy, before Villeroy should be roused into action. There was nothing\r\nto stop that general and his army from marching into Franconia, whence\r\nthe Allies drew their principal supplies; and besides thus distressing\r\nthem, he might, by marching on and joining his army to those of Tallard\r\nand the Elector, form a mass which would overwhelm the force under\r\nMarlborough and Eugene. On the other hand, the chances of a battle\r\nseemed perilous, and the fatal consequences of a defeat were certain.\r\nThe inferiority of the Allies in point of number was not very great, but\r\nstill it was not to be disregarded; and the advantage which the enemy\r\nseemed to have in the composition of their troops was striking. Tallard\r\nand Marsin had forty-five thousand Frenchmen under them, all veterans,\r\nand all trained to act together: the Elector's own troops also were good\r\nsoldiers. Marlborough, like Wellington at Waterloo, headed an army, of\r\nwhich the larger proportion consisted not of English, but of men of many\r\ndifferent nations, and many different languages. He was also obliged\r\nto be the assailant in the action, and thus to expose his troops to\r\ncomparatively heavy loss at the commencement of the battle, while the\r\nenemy would fight under the protection of the villages and lines which\r\nthey were actively engaged in strengthening. The consequences of a\r\ndefeat of the confederated army must have broken up the Grand Alliance,\r\nand realised the proudest hopes of the French king. Mr. Alison, in his\r\nadmirable military history of the Duke of Marlborough, has truly stated\r\nthe effects which would have taken place if France had been successful\r\nin the war. And, when the position of the Confederates at the time when\r\nBlenheim was fought is remembered; when we recollect the exhaustion of\r\nAustria, the menacing insurrection of Hungary, the feuds and jealousies\r\nof the German princes, the strength and activity of the Jacobite party\r\nin England, the imbecility of nearly all the Dutch statesmen of the\r\ntime, and the weakness of Holland if deprived of her allies, we may\r\nadopt his words in speculating on what would have ensued, if France\r\nhad been victorious in the battle, and \"if a power, animated by the\r\nambition, guided by the fanaticism and directed by the ability of that\r\nof Louis XIV., had gained the ascendancy in Europe. Beyond all question,\r\na universal despotic dominion would have been established over the\r\nbodies, a cruel spiritual thraldom over the minds of men. France and\r\nSpain united under Bourbon princes, and in a close family alliance--the\r\nempire of Charlemagne with that of Charles V.--the power which revolted\r\nthe edict of Nantes, and perpetrated the massacre of St. Bartholomew,\r\nwith that which banished the Moriscoes, and established the Inquisition,\r\nwould have proved irresistible, and beyond example destructive to the\r\nbest interests of mankind.\r\n\r\n\"The Protestants might have been driven, like the Pagan heathens of old\r\nby the son of Pepin, beyond the Elbe; the Stuart race, and with them\r\nRomish, ascendancy, might have been re-established in England; the fire\r\nlighted by Latimer and Ridley might have been extinguished in blood; and\r\nthe energy breathed by religious freedom into the Anglo-Saxon race\r\nmight have expired. The destinies of the world would have been changed.\r\nEurope, instead of a variety of independent states, whose mutual,\r\nhostility kept alive courage, while their national rivalry stimulated\r\ntalent, would have sunk into the slumber attendant on universal\r\ndominion. The colonial empire of England would have withered away and\r\nperished, as that of Spain has done in the grasp of the Inquisition. The\r\nAnglo-Saxon race would have been arrested in its mission to overspread\r\nthe earth and subdue it. The centralised despotism of the Roman empire\r\nwould have been renewed on Continental Europe; the chains of Romish\r\ntyranny, and with them the general infidelity of France before the\r\nRevolution, would have extinguished or perverted thought in the British\r\nislands.\" [Alison's Life of Marlborough, p. 248.]\r\n\r\nMarlborough's words at the council of war, when a battle was resolved\r\non, are remarkable, and they deserve recording. We know them on the\r\nauthority of his chaplain, Mr. (afterwards Bishop) Hare, who accompanied\r\nhim throughout the campaign, and in whose journal the biographers of\r\nMarlborough have found many of their best materials. Marborough's words\r\nto the officers who remonstrated with him on the seeming temerity of\r\nattacking the enemy in their position, were--\"I know the danger, yet a\r\nbattle is absolutely necessary; and I rely on the bravery and discipline\r\nof the troops, which will make amends for our disadvantages.\" In the\r\nevening orders were issued for a general engagement, and received by the\r\narmy with an alacrity which justified his confidence.\r\n\r\nThe French and Bavarians were posted behind a little stream called the\r\nNebel, which runs almost from north to south into the Danube immediately\r\nin front of the village of Blenheim. The Nebel flows along a little\r\nvalley, and the French occupied the rising ground to the west of it.\r\nThe village of Blenheim was the extreme right of their position, and the\r\nvillage of Lutzingen, about three miles north of Blenheim, formed their\r\nleft. Beyond Lutzingen are the rugged high grounds of the Godd Berg, and\r\nEich Berg, on the skirts of which some detachments were posted so as to\r\nsecure the Gallo-Bavarian position from being turned on the left flank.\r\nThe Danube protected their right flank; and it was only in front that\r\nthey could be attacked. The villages of Blenheim and Lutzingen had been\r\nstrongly palisadoed and entrenched. Marshal Tallard, who held the chief\r\ncommand, took his station at Blenheim: Prince Maximilian the Elector,\r\nand Marshal Marsin commanded on the left. Tallard garrisoned Blenheim\r\nwith twenty-six battalions of French infantry, and twelve squadrons\r\nof French cavalry. Marsin and the Elector had twenty-two battalions of\r\ninfantry, and thirty-six squadrons of cavalry in front of the village of\r\nLutzingen. The centre was occupied by fourteen battalions of infantry,\r\nincluding the celebrated Irish Brigade. These were posted in the little\r\nhamlet of Oberglau, which lies somewhat nearer to Lutzingen than to\r\nBlenheim. Eighty squadrons of cavalry and seven battalions of foot were\r\nranged between Oberglau and Blenheim. Thus the French position was very\r\nstrong at each extremity, but was comparatively weak in the centre.\r\nTallard seems to have relied on the swampy state of the part of the\r\nvalley that reaches from below Oberglau to Blenheim, for preventing any\r\nserious attack on this part of his line.\r\n\r\nThe army of the Allies was formed into two great divisions: the largest\r\nbeing commanded by the Duke in person, and being destined to act against\r\nTallard, while Prince Eugene led the other division, which consisted\r\nchiefly of cavalry, and was intended to oppose the enemy under Marsin\r\nand the Elector. As they approached the enemy, Marlborough's troops\r\nformed the left and the centre, while Eugene's formed the right of the\r\nentire army. Early in the morning of the 13th of August, the Allies left\r\ntheir own camp and marched towards the enemy. A thick haze covered the\r\nground, and it was not until the allied right and centre had advanced\r\nnearly within cannon-shot of the enemy that Tallard was aware of their\r\napproach. He made his preparations with what haste he could, and about\r\neight o'clock a heavy fire of artillery was opened from the French right\r\non the advancing left wing of the British. Marlborough ordered up some\r\nof his batteries to reply to it, and while the columns that were to form\r\nthe allied left and centre deployed, and took up their proper stations\r\nin the line, a warm cannonade was kept up by the guns on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe ground which Eugene's columns had to traverse was peculiarly\r\ndifficult, especially for the passage of the artillery; and it was\r\nnearly mid-day before he could get his troops into line opposite to\r\nLutzingen. During this interval, Marlborough ordered divine service to\r\nbe performed by the chaplains at the head of each regiment; and then\r\nrode along the lines, and found both officers and men in the highest\r\nspirits, and waiting impatiently for the signal for the the attack. At\r\nlength an aide-de-camp galloped up from the right with the welcome news\r\nthat Eugene was ready. Marlborough instantly sent Lord Cutts, with a\r\nstrong brigade of infantry, to assault the village of Blenheim, while he\r\nhimself led the main body down the eastward slope of the valley of the\r\nNebel, and prepared to effect the passage of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe assault on Blenheim, though bravely made, was repulsed with severe\r\nloss; and Marlborough, finding how strongly that village was garrisoned,\r\ndesisted from any further attempts to carry it, and bent all his\r\nenergies to breaking the enemy's line between Blenheim and Oberglau.\r\nSome temporary bridges had been prepared, and planks and fascinas had\r\nbeen collected; and by the aid of these and a little stone bridge which\r\ncrossed the Nebel, near a hamlet called Unterglau, that lay in the\r\ncentre of the valley, Marlborough succeeded in getting several squadrons\r\nacross the Nebel, though it was divided into several branches, and the\r\nground between them was soft, and in places, little better than a mere\r\nmarsh. But the French artillery was not idle. The cannon balls plunged\r\nincessantly among the advancing squadrons of the allies; and bodies of\r\nFrench cavalry rode frequently down from the western ridge, to charge\r\nthem before they had time to form on the firm ground. It was only by\r\nsupporting his men by fresh troops, and by bringing up infantry, who\r\nchecked the advance of the enemy's horse by their steady fire, that\r\nMarlborough was able to save his army in this quarter from a repulse,\r\nwhich, following the failure of the attack upon Blenheim, would probably\r\nhave been fatal to the Allies. By degrees, his cavalry struggled over\r\nthe blood-stained streams; the infantry were also now brought across, so\r\nas to keep in check the French troops who held Blenheim, and who, when\r\nno longer assailed in front, had begun to attack the Allies on their\r\nleft with considerable effect.\r\n\r\nMarlborough had thus at last succeeded in drawing up the whole left wing\r\nof his army beyond the Nebel, and was about to press forward with it,\r\nwhen he was called away to another part of the field by a disaster that\r\nhad befallen his centre. The Prince of Holstein-Beck had, with eleven\r\nHanoverian battalions, passed the Nebel opposite to Oberglau, when he\r\nwas charged and utterly routed by the Irish brigade which held that\r\nvillage. The Irish drove the Hanoverians back with heavy slaughter,\r\nbroke completely through the line of the Allies, and nearly achieved a\r\nsuccess as brilliant as that which the same brigade afterwards gained\r\nat Fontenoy. But at Blenheim their ardour in pursuit led them too far.\r\nMarlborough came up in person, and dashed in upon their exposed flank\r\nwith some squadrons of British cavalry. The Irish reeled back, and as\r\nthey strove to regain the height of Oberglau, their column was raked\r\nthrough and through by the fire of three battalions of the Allies,\r\nwhich Marlborough had summoned up from the reserve. Marlborough having\r\nre-established the order and communication of the Allies in this\r\nquarter, now, as he returned to his own left wing, sent to learn how his\r\ncolleague fared against Marsin and the Elector, and to inform Eugene of\r\nhis own success.\r\n\r\nEugene had hitherto not been equally fortunate. He had made three\r\nattacks on the enemy opposed to him, and had been thrice driven back.\r\nIt was only by his own desperate personal exertions, and the remarkable\r\nsteadiness of the regiments of Prussian infantry which were under him,\r\nthat he was able to save his wing from being totally defeated. But\r\nit was on the southern part of the battle-field, on the ground which\r\nMarlborough had won beyond the Nebel with such difficulty, that the\r\ncrisis of the battle was to be decided.\r\n\r\nLike Hannibal, Marlborough relied principally on his cavalry for\r\nachieving his decisive successes, and it was by his cavalry that\r\nBlenheim, the greatest of his victories, was won. The battle had lasted\r\ntill five in the afternoon. Marlborough had now eight thousand horseman\r\ndrawn up in two lines, and in the most perfect order for a general\r\nattack on the enemy's line along the space between Blenheim and\r\nOberglau. The infantry was drawn up in battalions in their rear, so as\r\nto support them if repulsed, and to keep in check the large masses of\r\nthe French that still occupied the village of Blenheim. Tallard now\r\ninterlaced his squadrons of cavalry with battalions of infantry; and\r\nMarlborough by a corresponding movement, brought several regiments of\r\ninfantry, and some pieces of artillery, to his front line, at intervals\r\nbetween the bodies of horse. A little after five, Marlborough commenced\r\nthe decisive movement, and the allied cavalry, strengthened and\r\nsupported by foot and guns, advanced slowly from the lower ground near\r\nthe Nebel up the slope to where the French cavalry, ten thousand strong,\r\nawaited them. On riding over the summit of the acclivity, the Allies\r\nwere received with so hot a fire from the French artillery and small\r\narms, that at first the cavalry recoiled, but without abandoning the\r\nhigh ground. The guns and the infantry which they had brought with them,\r\nmaintained the contest with spirit and effect. The French fire seemed\r\nto slacken Marlborough instantly ordered a charge along the line. The\r\nallied cavalry galloped forward at the enemy's squadrons, and the hearts\r\nof the French horseman failed them. Discharging their carbines at an\r\nidle distance, they wheeled round and spurred from the field, leaving\r\nthe nine infantry battalions of their comrades to be ridden down by\r\nthe torrent of the allied cavalry. The battle was now won. Tallard and\r\nMarsin, severed from each other, thought only of retreat. Tallard drew\r\nup the squadrons of horse which he had left in a line extended towards\r\nBlenheim, and sent orders to the infantry in that village to leave and\r\njoin him without delay. But long ere his orders could be obeyed,\r\nthe conquering squadrons of Marlborough had wheeled to the left and\r\nthundered down on the feeble army of the French marshal. Part of the\r\nforce which Tallard had drawn up for this last effort was driven into\r\nthe Danube; part fled with their general to the village of Sonderheim,\r\nwhere they were soon surrounded by the victorious Allies, and compelled\r\nto surrender. Meanwhile, Eugene had renewed his attack upon the\r\nGallo-Bavarian left, and Marsin, finding his colleague utterly routed,\r\nand his own right flank uncovered, prepared to retreat. He and the\r\nElector succeeded in withdrawing a considerable part of their troops\r\nin tolerable order to Dillingen; but the large body of French\r\nwho garrisoned Blenheim were left exposed to certain destruction.\r\nMarlborough speedily occupied all the outlets from the village with\r\nhis victorious troops, and then, collecting his artillery round it, he\r\ncommenced a cannonade that speedily would have destroyed Blenheim itself\r\nand all who were in it. After several gallant but unsuccessful attempts\r\nto cut their way through the Allies, the French in Blenheim were at\r\nlength compelled to surrender at discretion; and twenty-four battalions,\r\nand twelve squadrons, with all their officers, laid down their arms, and\r\nbecame the captives of Marlborough.\r\n\r\n\"Such,\" says Voltaire, \"was the celebrated battle, which the French call\r\nthe battle of Hochstet, the Germans Plentheim, and the English Blenheim,\r\nThe conquerors had about five thousand killed, and eight thousand\r\nwounded, the greater part being on the side of Prince Eugene. The French\r\narmy was almost entirely destroyed: of sixty thousand men, so long\r\nvictorious, there never reassembled more than twenty thousand effective.\r\nAbout twelve thousand killed, fourteen thousand prisoners, all the\r\ncannon, a prodigious number of colours and standards, all the tents\r\nand equipages, the general of the army, and one thousand two hundred\r\nofficers of mark, in the power of the conqueror, signalised that day!\"\r\n\r\nUlm, Landau, Treves, and Traerbach surrendered to the allies before the\r\nclose of the year. Bavaria submitted to the emperor, and the Hungarians\r\nlaid down their arms. Germany was completely delivered from France;\r\nand the military ascendancy of the arms of the Allies was completely\r\nestablished. Throughout the rest of the war Louis fought only in\r\ndefence. Blenheim had dissipated for ever his once proud visions of\r\nalmost universal conquest.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF EVENTS BETWEEN THE BATTLE OF BLENHEIM, 1704, AND THE BATTLE\r\nOF PULTOWA, 1709.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1705.

Four years ago, the fulfilment of the last of\r\nthese alternatives appeared most probable. But the democratic movements\r\nof 1848 were sternly repressed in 1849. The absolute authority of\r\na single ruler, and the austere stillness of martial law, are now\r\nparamount in the capitals of the continent, which lately owned no\r\nsovereignty save the will of the multitude; and where that which the\r\ndemocrat calls his sacred right of insurrection, was so loudly asserted\r\nand so often fiercely enforced. Many causes have contributed to bring\r\nabout this reaction, but the most effective and the most permanent have\r\nbeen Russian influence and Russian arms. Russia is now the avowed and\r\nacknowledged champion of Monarchy against Democracy;--of constituted\r\nauthority, however acquired, against revolution and change for whatever\r\npurpose desired;--of the imperial supremacy of strong states over their\r\nweaker neighbours against all claims for political independence, and\r\nall striving for separate nationality. She has crushed the heroic\r\nHungarians; and Austria, for whom nominally she crushed them, is now one\r\nof her dependents. Whether the rumours of her being about to engage\r\nin fresh enterprises be well or ill founded, it is certain that recent\r\nevents must have fearfully augmented the power of the Muscovite empire,\r\nwhich, even previously, had been the object of well-founded anxiety to\r\nall Western Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was truly stated, twelve years ago, that \"the acquisitions which\r\nRussia has made within the [then] last sixty-four years, are equal in\r\nextent and importance to the whole empire she had in Europe before that\r\ntime; that the acquisitions she had made from Sweden are greater than\r\nwhat remains of that ancient kingdom; that her acquisitions from Poland\r\nare as large as the whole Austrian empire; that the territory she has\r\nwrested from Turkey in Europe is equal to the dominions of Prussia,\r\nexclusive of her Rhenish provinces; and that her acquisitions from\r\nTurkey in Asia are equal in extent to all the smaller states of Germany,\r\nthe Rhenish provinces of Prussia, Belgium, and Holland taken together;\r\nthat the country she has conquered from Persia is about the size of\r\nEngland; that her acquisitions in Tartary have an area equal to Turkey\r\nin Europe, Greece, Italy, and Spain. In sixty-four years she has\r\nadvanced her frontier eight hundred and fifty miles towards Vienna,\r\nBerlin, Dresden, Munich, and Paris; she has approached four hundred and\r\nfifty miles nearer to Constantinople; she has possessed herself of the\r\ncapital of Poland, and has advanced to within a few miles of the capital\r\nof Sweden, from which, when Peter the Great mounted the throne, her\r\nfrontier was distant three hundred miles. Since that time she has\r\nstretched herself forward about one thousand miles towards India, and\r\nthe same distance towards the capital of Persia.\" [Progress of Russia in\r\nthe East. p. 142.]\r\n\r\nSuch, at that period, had been the recent aggrandisement of Russia; and\r\nthe events of the last few years, by weakening and disuniting all\r\nher European neighbours, have immeasurably augmented the relative\r\nsuperiority of the Muscovite empire over all the other continental\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nWith a population exceeding sixty millions, all implicitly obeying the\r\nimpulse of a single ruling mind; with a territorial area of six millions\r\nand a half of square miles; with a standing army eight hundred thousand\r\nstrong; with powerful fleets on the Baltic and Black Seas; with a\r\nskilful host of diplomatic agents planted in every court, and among\r\nevery tribe; with the confidence which unexpected success creates, and\r\nthe sagacity which long experience fosters, Russia now grasps with an\r\narmed right hand the tangled thread of European politics, and issues her\r\nmandate as the arbitress of the movements of the age. Yet a century and\r\na half have hardly elapsed since she was first recognised as a member\r\nof the drama of modern European history--previously to the battle of\r\nPultowa, Russia played no part. Charles V. and his great rival our\r\nElizabeth and her adversary Philip of Spain, the Guises, Sully,\r\nRichelieu, Cromwell, De Witt, William of Orange, and the other leading\r\nspirits of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, thought no more\r\nabout the Muscovite Czar than we now think about the King of Timbuctoo.\r\nEven as late as 1735, Lord Bollingbroke, in his admirable \"Letters on\r\nHistory,\" speaks of the history of the Muscovites, as having no relation\r\nto the knowledge which a practical English statesman ought to acquire.\r\n[Bolingbroke's Works, vol ii. p. 374. In the same page he observes how\r\nSweden had often turned her arms southwards with prodigious effect.] It\r\nmay be doubted whether a cabinet council often takes place now in\r\nour Foreign Office, without Russia being uppermost in every English\r\nstatesman's thoughts.\r\n\r\nBut though Russia remained thus long unheeded amid her snows, there\r\nwas a northern power, the influence of which was acknowledged in the\r\nprincipal European quarrels, and whose good will was sedulously courted\r\nby many of the boldest chiefs and ablest councillors of the leading\r\nstates. This was Sweden; Sweden, on whose ruins Russia has risen; but\r\nwhose ascendancy over her semi-barbarous neighbours was complete, until\r\nthe fatal battle that now forms our subject.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1542 France had sought the alliance of Sweden to aid her in\r\nher struggle against Charles V. And the name of Gustavus Adolphus is of\r\nitself sufficient to remind us, that in the great contest for religious\r\nliberty, of which Germany was for thirty years the arena, it was Sweden\r\nthat rescued the falling cause of Protestantism; and it was Sweden that\r\nprincipally dictated the remodelling of the European state system at the\r\npeace of Westphalia.\r\n\r\nFrom the proud pre-eminence in which the valour of the \"Lion of the\r\nNorth\" and of Torstenston, Bannier, Wrangel and the other Generals of\r\nGustavus, guided by the wisdom of Oxenstiern, had placed Sweden, the\r\ndefeat of Charles XII. at Pultowa hurled her down at once and for ever.\r\nHer efforts during the wars of the French revolution to assume a leading\r\npart in European politics, met with instant discomfiture, and almost\r\nprovoked derision. But the Sweden, whose sceptre was bequeathed to\r\nChristina, and whose alliance Cromwell valued so highly, was a different\r\npower from the Sweden of the present day. Finland, Ingria, Livonia,\r\nEsthonia, Carelia, and other districts east of the Baltic, then were\r\nSwedish provinces; and the possession of Pomerania, Rugen, and Bremen,\r\nmade her an important member of the Germanic empire. These territories\r\nare now all reft from her; and the most valuable of them form the staple\r\nof her victorious rival's strength. Could she resume them, could\r\nthe Sweden of 1648 be reconstructed, we should have a first-class\r\nScandinavian State in the North, well qualified to maintain the balance\r\nof power, and check the progress of Russia; whose power, indeed, never\r\ncould have become formidable to Europe, save by Sweden becoming weak.\r\n\r\nThe decisive triumph of Russia over Sweden at Pultowa was therefore\r\nall-important to the world, on account of what it overthrew as well as\r\nfor what it established; and it is the more deeply interesting because\r\nit was not merely the crisis of a struggle between two states, but it\r\nwas a trial of strength between two great races of mankind. We must bear\r\nin mind, that while the Swedes, like the English, the Dutch, and others,\r\nbelong to the Germanic race, the Russians are a Sclavonic people.\r\nNations of Sclavonian origin have long occupied the greater part of\r\nEurope eastward of the Vistula, and the populations also of Bohemia,\r\nCroatia, Servia, Dalmatia, and other important regions westward of that\r\nriver, are Sclavonic. In the long and varied conflicts between them and\r\nthe Germanic nations that adjoin them, the Germanic race had, before\r\nPultowa, almost always maintained a superiority. With the single\r\nbut important exception of Poland, no Sclavonic state had made any\r\nconsiderable figure in history before the time when Peter the Great won\r\nhis great victory over the Swedish king. [The Hussite wars may, perhaps,\r\nentitle Bohemia to be distinguished.] What Russia has done since that\r\ntime we know and we feel. And some of the wisest and best men of our own\r\nage and nation, who have watched with deepest care the annals and the\r\ndestinies of humanity, have believed that the Sclavonic element in the\r\npopulation of Europe has as yet only partially developed its powers:\r\nthat, while other races of mankind (our own, the Germanic, included)\r\nhave exhausted their creative energies, and completed their allotted\r\nachievements, the Sclavonic race has yet a great career to run: and,\r\nthat the narrative of Sclavonic ascendancy is the remaining page that;\r\nwill conclude the history of the world. [See Arnold's Lectures on Modern\r\nHistory, pp. 36-39.]\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed that in thus regarding the primary triumph of\r\nRussia over Sweden as a victory of the Sclavonic over the Germanic\r\nrace, we are dealing with matters of mere ethnological pedantry, or\r\nwith themes of mere speculative curiosity. The fact that Russia is\r\na Sclavonic empire, is a fact of immense practical influence at\r\nthe present moment. Half the inhabitants of the Austrian empire are\r\nSclavonian. The population of the larger part of Turkey in Europe is of\r\nthe same race. Silesia, Posen, and other parts of the Prussian dominions\r\nare principally Sclavonic. And during late years an enthusiastic zeal\r\nfor blending all Sclavonians into one great united Sclavonic empire,\r\nhas been growing up in these countries, which, however we may deride its\r\nprinciple, is not the less real and active, and of which Russia, as\r\nthe head and champion of the Sclavonic race, knows well how to take her\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n[\"The idea of Panslavism had a purely literary origin. It was started by\r\nPollar, a Protestant clergyman of the Sclavonic congregation at\r\nPesth, in Hungary, who wished to establish a national literature,\r\nby circulating all works, written in the various Sclavonic dialects,\r\nthrough every country where any of them are spoken. He suggested, that\r\nall the Slavonic literati should become acguainted with the sister\r\ndialects, so that a Bohemian, or other work, might be read on the shores\r\nof the Adriatic, as well as on the banks of the Volga, or any other\r\nplace where a Sclavonic language was spoken; by which means an extensive\r\nliterature might be created, tending to advance knowledge in all\r\nSclavonic countries; and he supported his arguments by observing, that\r\nthe dialects of ancient Greece differed from each other, like those of\r\nhis own language, and yet that they formed only one Hellenic literature.\r\nThe idea of an intellectual union of all those nations naturally led to\r\nthat of a political one; and the Sclavonians, seeing that their numbers\r\namounted to about one-third part of the whole population of Europe, and\r\noccupied more than half its territory, began to be sensible that they\r\nmight claim for themselves a position, to which they had not hitherto\r\naspired.\r\n\r\n\"The opinion gained ground; and the question now is, whether the\r\nSlavonians can form a nation independent of Russia; or whether they\r\nought to rest satisfied in being part of one great race, with the most\r\npowerful member of it as their chief. The latter, indeed, is gaining\r\nground amongst them; and some Poles are disposed to attribute their\r\nsufferings to the arbitrary will of the Czar, without extending the\r\nblame to the Russians themselves. These begin to think that, if they\r\ncannot exist as Poles, the best thing to be done is to rest satisfied\r\nwith a position in the Sclavonic empire, and they hope that, when once\r\nthey give up the idea of restoring their country, Russia may grant some\r\nconcessions to their separate nationality.\r\n\r\n\"The same idea has been put forward by writers in the Russian interest;\r\ngreat efforts are making among other Sclavonic people, to induce them\r\nto look upon Russia as their future head; and she has already\r\ngained considerable influence over the Sclavonic populations of\r\nTurkey.\"--WILKINSON'S DALMATIA.]\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that Russia owes her very name to a band of\r\nSwedish invaders who conquered her a thousand years ago. They were soon\r\nabsorbed in the Sclavonic population, and every trace of the Swedish\r\ncharacter had disappeared in Russia for many centuries before her\r\ninvasion by Charles XII. She was long the victim and the slave of the\r\nTartars; and for many considerable periods of years the Poles held her\r\nin subjugation. Indeed, if we except the expeditions of some of\r\nthe early Russian chiefs against Byzantium, and the reign of Ivan\r\nVasilovitch, the history of Russia before the time of Peter the Great is\r\none long tale of suffering and degradation.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may have been the amount of national injuries that she\r\nsustained from Swede, from Tartar, or from Pole in the ages of her\r\nweakness, she has certainly retaliated ten-fold during the century and\r\na half of her strength. Her rapid transition at the commencement of that\r\nperiod from being the prey of every conqueror to being the conqueror of\r\nall with whom she comes into contact, to being the oppressor instead of\r\nthe oppressed, is almost without a parallel in the history of nations.\r\nIt was the work of a single ruler; who, himself without education,\r\npromoted science and literature among barbaric millions; who gave them\r\nfleets, commerce, arts, and arms; who, at Pultowa, taught them to face\r\nand beat the previously invincible Swedes: and who made stubborn valour,\r\nand implicit subordination, from that time forth the distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of the Russian soldiery, which had before his time been\r\na mere disorderly and irresolute rabble.\r\n\r\nThe career of Philip of Macedon resembles most nearly that of the great\r\nMuscovite Czar: but there is this important difference, that Philip\r\nhad, while young, received in Southern Greece the best education in all\r\nmatters of peace and war that the ablest philosophers and generals of\r\nthe age could bestow. Peter was brought up among barbarians, and in\r\nbarbaric ignorance. He strove to remedy this when a grown man, by\r\nleaving all the temptations to idleness and sensuality, which his court\r\noffered, and by seeking instruction abroad. He laboured with his own\r\nhands as a common artisan in Holland and in England, that he might\r\nreturn and teach his subjects how ships, commerce, and civilization\r\ncould be acquired. There is a degree of heroism here superior\r\nto anything that we know of in the Macedonian king. But Philip's\r\nconsolidation of the long disunited Macedonian empire,--his raising a\r\npeople which he found the scorn of their civilized southern neighbours,\r\nto be their dread,--his organization of a brave and well-disciplined\r\narmy, instead of a disorderly militia,--his creation of a maritime\r\nforce, and his systematic skill in acquiring and improving sea-ports and\r\narsenals,--his patient tenacity of purpose under reverses,--his\r\npersonal bravery,--and even his proneness to coarse amusements and\r\npleasures,--all mark him out as the prototype of the imperial founder of\r\nthe Russian power. In justice, however, to the ancient hero, it ought\r\nto be added, that we find in the history of Philip no examples of that\r\nsavage cruelty which deforms so grievously the character of Peter the\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\nIn considering the effects of the overthrow which the Swedish arms\r\nsustained at Pultowa, and in speculating on the probable consequences\r\nthat would have followed if the invaders had been successful we must not\r\nonly bear in mind the wretched state In which Peter found Russia at his\r\naccession, compared with her present grandeur, but we must also keep in\r\nview the fact, that, at the time when Pultowa was fought, his reforms\r\nwere yet incomplete, and his new institutions immature. He had broken\r\nup the old Russia; and the New Russia, which he ultimately created,\r\nwas still in embryo. Had he been crushed at Pultowa, his mighty schemes\r\nwould have been buried with him; and (to use the words of Voltaire) \"the\r\nmost extensive empire in the world would have relapsed into the chaos\r\nfrom which it had been so lately taken.\" It is this fact that makes the\r\nrepulse of Charles XII. the critical point in the fortunes of Russia.\r\nThe danger which she incurred a century afterwards from her invasion by\r\nNapoleon was in reality far less than her peril when Charles attacked\r\nher; though the French Emperor, as a military genius, was infinitely\r\nsuperior to the Swedish King, and led a host against her, compared with\r\nwhich the armies of Charles seem almost insignificant. But, as Fouche\r\nwell warned his imperial master, when he vainly endeavoured to dissuade\r\nhim from his disastrous expedition against the empire of the Czars,\r\nthe difference between the Russia of 1812 and the Russia of 1709 was\r\ngreater, than the disparity between the power of Charles and the might\r\nof Napoleon. \"If that heroic king,\" said Fouche, \"had not, like your\r\nimperial Majesty, half Europe in arms to back him, neither had his\r\nopponent, the Czar Peter, 400,000 soldiers, and 60,000 Cossacks.\"\r\nThe historians, who describe the state of the Muscovite empire when\r\nrevolutionary and imperial France encountered it, narrate with truth and\r\njustice, how \"at the epoch of the French Revolution this immense empire,\r\ncomprehending nearly half of Europe and Asia within its dominions,\r\ninhabited by a patient and indomitable race, ever ready to exchange the\r\nluxury and adventure of the south for the hardships and monotony of the\r\nnorth, was daily becoming more formidable to the liberties of Europe.\r\nThe Russian infantry had then long been celebrated for its immoveable\r\nfirmness. Her immense population, amounting then in Europe alone to\r\nnearly thirty-five millions, afforded an inexhaustible supply of men.\r\nHer soldiers, inured to heat and cold from their infancy, and actuated\r\nby a blind devotion to their Czar, united the steady valour of the\r\nEnglish to the impetuous energy of the French troops.\" [Alison.] So,\r\nalso, we read how the haughty aggressions of Bonaparte \"went to excite\r\na national feeling, from the banks of the Borysthenes to the wall of\r\nChina, and to unite against him the wild and uncivilized inhabitants\r\nof an extended empire, possessed by a love to their religion, their\r\ngovernment, and their country, and having a character of stern devotion,\r\nwhich he was incapable of estimating.\" [Scott's Life of Napoleon] But\r\nthe Russia of 1709 had no such forces to oppose to an assailant. Her\r\nwhole population then was below sixteen millions; and, what is far more\r\nimportant, this population had neither acquired military spirit, nor\r\nstrong nationality; nor was it united in loyal attachment to its ruler.\r\n\r\nPeter had wisely abolished the old regular troops of the empire, the\r\nStrelitzes; but the forces which he had raised in their stead on a new\r\nand foreign plan, and principally officered with foreigners, had, before\r\nthe Swedish invasion, given no proof that they could be relied on. In\r\nnumerous encounters with the Swedes, Peter's soldiery had run like sheep\r\nbefore inferior numbers. Great discontent, also, had been excited among\r\nall classes of the community by the arbitrary changes which their\r\ngreat emperor introduced, many of which clashed with the most cherished\r\nnational prejudices of his subjects. A career of victory and prosperity\r\nhad not yet raised Peter above the reach of that disaffection, nor had\r\nsuperstitious obedience to the Czar yet become the characteristic of\r\nthe Muscovite mind. The victorious occupation of Moscow by Charles XII.\r\nwould have quelled the Russian nation as effectually, as had been the\r\ncase when Batou Khan, and other ancient invaders, captured the capital\r\nof primitive Muscovy. How little such a triumph could effect towards\r\nsubduing modern Russia, the fate of Napoleon demonstrated at once and\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nThe character of Charles XII. has been a favourite theme with\r\nhistorians, moralists, philosophers, and poets. But it is his military\r\nconduct during the campaign in Russia that alone requires comment here.\r\nNapoleon, in the memoirs dictated by him at St. Helena, has given us a\r\nsystematic criticism on that, among other celebrated campaigns, his\r\nown Russian campaign included. He labours hard to prove that he himself\r\nobserved all the true principles of offensive war: and probably his\r\ncensures of Charles's generalship were rather highly coloured, for\r\nthe sake of making his own military skill stand out in more favourable\r\nrelief. Yet, after making all allowances, we must admit the force of\r\nNapoleon's strictures on Charles's tactics, and own that his judgment,\r\nthough severe, is correct, when he pronounces that the Swedish king,\r\nunlike his great predecessor Gustavus, knew nothing of the art of war,\r\nand was nothing more than a brave and intrepid soldier. Such, however,\r\nwas not the light in which Charles was regarded by his contemporaries at\r\nthe commencement of his Russian expedition. His numerous victories,\r\nhis daring and resolute spirit, combined with the ancient renown of the\r\nSwedish arms, then filled all Europe with admiration and anxiety. As\r\nJohnson expresses it, his name was then one at which the world grew\r\npale. Even Louis le Grand earnestly solicited his assistance; and our\r\nown Marlborough, then in the full career of his victories, was specially\r\nsent by the English court to the camp of Charles, to propitiate the hero\r\nof the north in favour of the cause of the allies and to prevent the\r\nSwedish sword from being flung into the scale in the French king's\r\nfavour. But Charles at that time was solely bent on dethroning the\r\nsovereign of Russia, as he had already dethroned the sovereign of\r\nPoland, and all Europe fully believed that he would entirely crush the\r\nCzar, and dictate conditions of peace in the Kremlin. [Voltaire attests,\r\nfrom personal inspection of the letters of several public ministers to\r\ntheir respective courts, that such was the general expectation.] Charles\r\nhimself looked on success as a matter of certainty; and the romantic\r\nextravagance of his views was continually increasing. \"One year, he\r\nthought, would suffice for the conquest of Russia. The court of Rome\r\nwas next to feel his vengeance, as the pope had dared to oppose\r\nthe concession of religious liberty to the Silesian Protestants.\r\nNo enterprise at that time appeared impossible to him. He had even\r\ndispatched several officers privately into Asia and Egypt, to take\r\nplans of the towns, and examine into the strength and resources of those\r\ncountries.\" [Crighton's Scandinavia.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon thus epitomises the earlier operations of Charles's invasion of\r\nRussia:--\r\n\r\n\"That prince set out from his camp at Aldstadt, near Leipsic, in\r\nSeptember 1707, at the head of 46,000 men, and traversed Poland; 20,000\r\nmen, under Count Lewenhaupt, disembarked at Riga; and 15,000 were in\r\nFinland. He was therefore in a condition to have brought together 80,000\r\nof the best troops in the world. He left 10,000 men at Warsaw to guard\r\nKing Stanislaus, and in January 1708, arrived at Grodno, where he\r\nwintered. In June he crossed the forest of Minsk, and presented himself\r\nbefore Borisov; forced the Russian army, which occupied the left bank\r\nof the Beresina; defeated 20,000 Russians who were strongly entrenched\r\nbehind marshes; passed the Borysthenes at Mohiloev, and vanquished a\r\ncorps of 16,000 Muscovites near Smolensko, on the 22d of September. He\r\nwas now advanced to the confines of Lithuania, and was about to enter\r\nRussia Proper: the Czar, alarmed at his approach, made him proposals of\r\npeace. Up to this time all his movements mere conformable to rule, and\r\nhis communications were well secured. He was master of Poland and Riga,\r\nand only ten days' march distant from Moscow: and it is probable that\r\nhe would have reached that capital, had he not quitted the high road\r\nthither, and directed his steps towards the Ukraine, in order to form a\r\njunction with Mazeppa, who brought him only 6,000 men. By this movement\r\nhis line of operations, beginning at Sweden, exposed his flank to Russia\r\nfor a distance of four hundred leagues, and he was unable to protect it,\r\nor to receive either reinforcements or assistance.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon severely censures this neglect of one of the great rules of\r\nwar. He points out that Charles had not organized his war like Hannibal,\r\non the principle of relinquishing all communications with home, keeping\r\nall his forces concentrated, and creating a base of operations in the\r\nconquered country. Such had been the bold system of the Carthaginian\r\ngeneral; but Charles acted on no such principle, inasmuch as he caused\r\nLewenhaupt, one of his generals who commanded a considerable detachment,\r\nand escorted a most important convoy, to follow him at a distance\r\nof twelve days' march. By this dislocation of his forces he exposed\r\nLewenhaupt to be overwhelmed separately by the full force of the enemy,\r\nand deprived the troops under his own command of the aid which that\r\ngeneral's men and stores might have afforded, at the very crisis of the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThe Czar had collected an army of about a hundred thousand effective\r\nmen; and though the Swedes, in the beginning of the invasion, were\r\nsuccessful in every encounter, the Russian troops were gradually\r\nacquiring discipline; and Peter and his officers were learning\r\ngeneralship from their victors, as the Thebans of old learned it from\r\nthe Spartans. When Lewenhaupt, in the October of 1708, was striving to\r\njoin Charles in the Ukraine, the Czar suddenly attacked him near the\r\nBorysthenes with an overwhelming force of fifty thousand Russians.\r\nLewenhaupt fought bravely for three days, and succeeded in cutting his\r\nway through the enemy, with about four thousand of his men, to where\r\nCharles awaited him near the river Desna; but upwards of eight thousand\r\nSwedes fell in these battles; Lewenhaupt's cannon and ammunition were\r\nabandoned; and the whole of his important convoy of provisions, on which\r\nCharles and his half-starved troops were relying, fell into the enemy's\r\nhands. Charles was compelled to remain in the Ukraine during the winter;\r\nbut in the spring of 1709 he moved forward towards Moscow, and invested\r\nthe fortified town of Pultowa, on the river Vorskla, a place where the\r\nCzar had stored up large supplies of provisions and military stores, and\r\nwhich commanded the roads leading towards Moscow. The possession of this\r\nplace would have given Charles the means of supplying all the wants of\r\nhis suffering army, and would also have furnished him with a secure base\r\nof operations for his advance against the Muscovite capital. The\r\nsiege was therefore hotly pressed by the Swedes; the garrison resisted\r\nobstinately; and the Czar, feeling the importance of saving the town,\r\nadvanced in June to its relief, at the head of an army from fifty to\r\nsixty thousand strong.\r\n\r\nBoth sovereigns now prepared for the general action, which each\r\nperceived to be inevitable, and which each felt would be decisive of his\r\nown and of his country's destiny. The Czar, by some masterly manoeuvres,\r\ncrossed the Vorskla, and posted his army on the same side of that river\r\nwith the besiegers, but a little higher up. The Vorskla falls into the\r\nBorysthenes about fifteen leagues below Pultowa, and the Czar arranged\r\nhis forces in two lines, stretching from one river towards the other; so\r\nthat if the Swedes attacked him and were repulsed, they would be driven\r\nbackwards into the acute angle formed by the two streams at their\r\njunction. He fortified these lines with several redoubts, lined with\r\nheavy artillery; and his troops, both horse and foot, were in the best\r\npossible condition, and amply provided with stores and ammunition.\r\nCharles's forces were about twenty-four thousand strong. But not more\r\nthan half of these were Swedes; so much had battle, famine, fatigue, and\r\nthe deadly frosts of Russia, thinned the gallant bands which the Swedish\r\nking and Lewenhaupt had led to the Ukraine. The other twelve thousand\r\nmen under Charles were Cossacks and Wallachians, who had joined him\r\nin that country. On hearing that the Czar was about to attack him,\r\nhe deemed that his dignity required that he himself should be the\r\nassailant; and leading his army out of their entrenched lines before the\r\ntown, he advanced with them against the Russian redoubts.\r\n\r\nHe had been severely wounded in the foot in a skirmish a few days\r\nbefore; and was borne in a litter along the ranks, into the thick of the\r\nfight. Notwithstanding the fearful disparity of numbers and disadvantage\r\nof position, the Swedes never showed their ancient valour more nobly\r\nthan on that dreadful day. Nor do their Cossack and Wallachian allies\r\nseem to have been unworthy of fighting side by side with Charles's\r\nveterans. Two of the Russian redoubts were actually entered, and the\r\nSwedish infantry began to raise the cry of victory. But on the other\r\nside, neither general nor soldiers flinched in their duty. The Russian\r\ncannonade and musketry were kept up; fresh masses of defenders were\r\npoured into the fortifications, and at length the exhausted remnants of\r\nthe Swedish columns recoiled from the blood-stained redoubts. Then the\r\nCzar led the infantry and cavalry of his first line outside the works,\r\ndrew them up steadily and skilfully, and the action was renewed along\r\nthe whole fronts of the two armies on the open ground. Each sovereign\r\nexposed his life freely in the world-winning battle; and on each side\r\nthe troops fought obstinately and eagerly under their ruler's eye.\r\nIt was not till two hours from the commencement of the action that,\r\noverpowered by numbers, the hitherto invincible Swedes gave way. All was\r\nthen hopeless disorder and irreparable rout. Driven downward to where\r\nthe rivers join, the fugitive Swedes surrendered to their victorious\r\npursuers, or perished in the waters of the Borysthenes. Only a few\r\nhundreds swam that river with their king and the Cossack Mazeppa, and\r\nescaped into the Turkish territory. Nearly ten thousand lay killed and\r\nwounded in the redoubts and on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nIn the joy of his heart the Czar exclaimed, when the strife was over,\r\n\"That the son of the morning had fallen from heaven; and that the\r\nfoundations of St. Petersburg at length stood firm.\" Even on that\r\nbattle-field, near the Ukraine, the Russian emperor's first thoughts\r\nwere of conquests and aggrandisement on the Baltic. The peace of\r\nNystadt, which transferred the fairest provinces of Sweden to Russia,\r\nratified the judgment of battle which was pronounced at Pultowa. Attacks\r\non Turkey and Persia by Russia commenced almost directly after that\r\nvictory. And though the Czar failed in his first attempts against\r\nthe Sultan, the successors of Peter have, one and all, carried on an\r\nuniformly aggressive and uniformly successful system of policy against\r\nTurkey, and against every other state, Asiatic as well as European,\r\nwhich has had the misfortune of having Russia for a neighbour.\r\n\r\nOrators and authors, who have discussed the progress of Russia, have\r\noften alluded to the similitude between the modern extension of the\r\nMuscovite empire and the extension of the Roman dominions in ancient\r\ntimes. But attention has scarcely been drawn to the closeness of the\r\nparallel between conquering Russia and conquering Rome, not only in the\r\nextent of conquests, but in the means of effecting conquest. The history\r\nof Rome during the century and a half which followed the close of the\r\nsecond Punic war, and during which her largest acquisitions of territory\r\nwere made, should be minutely compared with the history of Russia for\r\nthe last one hundred and fifty years. The main points of similitude\r\ncan only be indicated in these pages; but they deserve the fullest\r\nconsideration. Above all, the sixth chapter of Montesquieu's great\r\nTreatise on Rome, the chapter \"DE LA CONDUITE QUE LES ROMAINS TINRENT\r\nPOUR SOUMETTRE LES PEUPLES,\" should be carefully studied by every one\r\nwho watches the career and policy of Russia. The classic scholar will\r\nremember the state-craft of the Roman Senate, which took care in\r\nevery foreign war to appear in the character of a PROTECTOR. Thus Rome\r\nPROTECTED the AEtolians, and the Greek cities, against Macedon; she\r\nPROTECTED Bithynia, and other small Asiatic states, against the Syrian\r\nkings; she protected Numidia against Carthage; and in numerous other\r\ninstances assumed the same specious character. But, \"Woe to the people\r\nwhose liberty depends on the continued forbearance of an over-mighty\r\nprotector.\" [Malkin's History of Greece.] Every state which Rome\r\nprotected was ultimately subjugated and absorbed by her. And Russia\r\nhas been the protector of Poland, the protector of the Crimea,--the\r\nprotector of Courland,--the protector of Georgia, Immeritia, Mingrelia,\r\nthe Tcherkessian and Caucasian tribes. She has first protected, and then\r\nappropriated them all. She protects Moldavia and Wallachia. A few years\r\nago she became the protector of Turkey from Mehemet Ali; and since the\r\nsummer of 1849 she has made herself the protector of Austria.\r\n\r\nWhen the partisans of Russia speak of the disinterestedness with\r\nwhich she withdrew her protecting troops from Constantinople, and from\r\nHungary, let us here also mark the ominous exactness of the parallel\r\nbetween her and Rome. While the ancient world yet contained a number of\r\nindependent states, which might have made a formidable league against\r\nRome if she had alarmed them by openly avowing her ambitious schemes,\r\nRome's favourite policy was seeming disinterestedness and moderation.\r\nAfter her first war against Philip, after that against Antiochus, and\r\nmany others, victorious Rome promptly withdrew her troops from the\r\nterritories which they occupied. She affected to employ her arms only\r\nfor the good of others; but, when the favourable moment came, she\r\nalways found a pretext for marching her legions back into each coveted\r\ndistrict, and making it a Roman province. Fear, not moderation, is the\r\nonly effective check on the ambition of such powers as Ancient Rome and\r\nModern Russia. The amount of that fear depends on the amount of timely\r\nvigilance and energy which other states choose to employ against the\r\ncommon enemy of their freedom and national independence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF EVENTS FROM THE BATTLE OF PULTOWA, 1709, AND THE DEFEAT OF\r\nBURGOYNE AT SARATOGA, 1777.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1713. Treaty of Utrecht. Philip is left by it in possession of\r\nthe throne of Spain. But Naples, Milan, the Spanish territories on the\r\nTuscan coast, the Spanish Netherlands, and some parts of the French\r\nNetherlands, are given to Austria. France cedes to England Hudson's\r\nBay and Straits, the Island of St. Christopher, Nova Scotia, and\r\nNewfoundland in America, Spain cedes to England Gibraltar and Minorca,\r\nwhich the English had taken during the war. The King of Prussia and the\r\nDuke of Savoy both obtain considerable additions of territory to their\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\n1714. Death of Queen Anne. The House of Hanover begins to reign in\r\nEngland. A rebellion in favour of the Stuarts is put down. Death of\r\nLouis XIV.\r\n\r\n1718. Charles XII. killed at the siege of Frederickshall.\r\n\r\n1725. Death of Peter the Great of Russia.\r\n\r\n1740. Frederick II, King of Prussia, begins his reign. He attacks the\r\nAustrian dominions, and conquers Silesia.\r\n\r\n1742. War between France and England.\r\n\r\n1743. Victory of the English at Dettingen.\r\n\r\n1745. Victory of the French at Fontenoy. Rebellion in Scotland in favour\r\nof the House of Stuart: finally quelled by the battle of Culloden in the\r\nnext year.\r\n\r\n1748. Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle.\r\n\r\n1756-1763. The Seven Years' War, during which Prussia makes an heroic\r\nresistance against the allies of Austria, Russia, and France. England,\r\nunder the administration of the elder Pitt (afterwards Lord Chatham),\r\ntakes a glorious part in the war in opposition to France and Spain.\r\nWolfe wins the battle of Quebec, and the English conquer Canada, Cape\r\nBreton, and St. John. Clive begins his career of conquest in India.\r\nCuba, is taken by the English from Spain.\r\n\r\n1763. Treaty of Paris: which leaves the power of Prussia increased, and\r\nits military reputation greatly exalted.\r\n\r\n\"France, by the treaty of Paris, ceded to England Canada, and the island\r\nof Cape Breton, with the islands and coasts of the gulf and river of St.\r\nLawrence. The boundaries between the two nations in North America were\r\nfixed by a line drawn along the middle of the Mississippi, from its\r\nsource to its mouth. All on the left or eastern bank of that river, was\r\ngiven up to England, except the city of New Orleans, which was reserved\r\nto France; as was also the liberty of the fisheries on a part of the\r\ncoasts of Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The islands of St.\r\nPeter and Miquelon were given them as a shelter for their fishermen, but\r\nwithout permission to raise fortifications. The islands of Martinico,\r\nGuadaloupe, Mariegalante, Desirada, and St. Lucia, were surrendered\r\nto France; while Grenada, the Grenadines, St. Vincent, Dominica, and\r\nTobago, were ceded to England. This latter power retained her conquests\r\non the Senegal, and restored to France the island of Gores, on-the coast\r\nof Africa. France was put in possession of the forts and factories which\r\nbelonged to her in the East Indies, on the coasts of Coromandel, Orissa,\r\nMalabar, and Bengal under the restriction of keeping up no military\r\nforce in Bengal.\r\n\r\n\"In Europe, France restored all the conquests she had made in Germany;\r\nas also the island, of Minorca, England gave up to her Belleisle, on the\r\ncoast of Brittany; while Dunkirk was kept in the same condition as had\r\nbeen determined by the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. The island of Cuba,\r\nwith the Havannah, were restored to the King of Spain, who, on his part,\r\nceded to England Florida, with Port-Augustine and the Bay of Pensacola.\r\nThe King of Portugal was restored to the same state in which he had\r\nbeen before the war. The colony of St. Sacrament in America, which the\r\nSpaniards had conquered, was given back to him.\r\n\r\n\"The peace of Paris, of which we have just now spoken, was the era of\r\nEngland's greatest prosperity. Her commerce and navigation extended over\r\nall parts of the globe, and were supported by a naval force so much\r\nthe more imposing, as it was no longer counter-balanced by the maritime\r\npower of France, which had been almost annihilated in the preceding war.\r\nThe immense territories which that peace had secured her, both in Africa\r\nand America, opened up new channels for her industry: and what deserves\r\nspecially to be remarked is, that she acquired at the same time vast\r\nand important possessions in the East Indies.\" [Koch's Revolutions of\r\nEurope.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. -- VICTORY OF THE AMERICANS OVER BURGOYNE AT SARATOGA,\r\nA.D. 1777.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Westward the course of empire takes its way;\r\n      The first four acts already past,\r\n      A fifth shall close the drama with the day:\r\n      TIME'S NOBLEST OFFSPRING IS ITS LAST.\"\r\n                                      BISHOP BERKELEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Even of those great conflicts, in which hundreds of thousands have been\r\nengaged and tens of thousands have fallen, none has been more fruitful\r\nof results than this surrender of thirty-five hundred fighting-men\r\nat Saratoga. It not merely changed the relations of England and\r\nthe feelings of Europe towards these insurgent colonies, but it has\r\nmodified, for all times to come, the connexion between every colony and\r\nevery parent state.\"--LORD MAHON.\r\n\r\nOf the four great powers that now principally rule the political\r\ndestinies of the world, France and England are the only two whose\r\ninfluence can be dated back beyond the last century and a half. The\r\nthird great power, Russia, was a feeble mass of barbarism before the\r\nepoch of Peter the Great; and the very existence of the fourth great\r\npower, as an independent nation, commenced within the memory of\r\nliving men. By the fourth great power of the world I mean the mighty\r\ncommonwealth of the western continent, which now commands the admiration\r\nof mankind. That homage is sometimes reluctantly given, and accompanied\r\nwith suspicion and ill-will. But none can refuse it. All the physical\r\nessentials for national strength are undeniably to be found in the\r\ngeographical position and amplitude of territory which the United States\r\npossess: in their almost inexhaustible tracts of fertile, but hitherto\r\nuntouched soil; in their stately forests, in their mountain-chains and\r\ntheir rivers, their beds of coal, and stores of metallic wealth; in\r\ntheir extensive seaboard along the waters of two oceans, and in their\r\nalready numerous and rapidly increasing population. And, when we examine\r\nthe character of this population, no one can look on the fearless\r\nenergy, the sturdy determination, the aptitude for local self\r\ngovernment, the versatile alacrity, and the unresting spirit of\r\nenterprise which characterise the Anglo-Americans, without feeling that\r\nhe here beholds the true moral elements of progressive might.\r\n\r\nThree quarters of a century have not yet passed away since the United\r\nStates ceased to be mere dependencies of England. And even if we\r\ndate their origin from the period when the first permanent European\r\nsettlements, out of which they grew, were made on the western coast\r\nof the North Atlantic, the increase of their strength is unparalleled,\r\neither in rapidity or extent.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Roman boasted, with reason, of the growth of Rome from\r\nhumble beginnings to the greatest magnitude which the world had then\r\never witnessed. But the citizen of the United States is still more\r\njustly entitled to claim this praise. In two centuries and a half his\r\ncountry has acquired ampler dominion than the Roman gained in ten. And\r\neven if we credit the legend of the band of shepherds and outlaws with\r\nwhich Romulus is said to have colonized the Seven Hills, we find not\r\nthere so small a germ of future greatness, as we find in the group of\r\na hundred and five ill-chosen and disunited emigrants who founded\r\nJamestown in 1607, or in the scanty band of the Pilgrim-Fathers, who, a\r\nfew years later, moored their bark on the wild and rock-bound coast of\r\nthe wilderness that was to become New England. The power of the United\r\nStates is emphatically the \"Imperium quo neque ab exordio ullum fere\r\nminus, neque incrementis toto orbe amplius humans potest memoria\r\nrecordari.\" [Eutropius, lib. i. (exordium).]\r\n\r\nNothing is more calculated to impress the mind with a sense of the\r\nrapidity with which the resources of the American republic advance, than\r\nthe difficulty which the historical inquirer finds in ascertaining their\r\nprecise amount. If he consults the most recent works, and those written\r\nby the ablest investigators of the subject, he finds in them admiring\r\ncomments on the change which the last few years, before those books were\r\nwritten, had made; but when he turns to apply the estimates in those\r\nbooks to the present moment, he finds them wholly inadequate. Before\r\na book on the subject of the United States has lost its novelty, those\r\nstates have outgrown the description which it contains. The celebrated\r\nwork of the French statesman, De Tocqueville, appeared about fifteen\r\nyears ago. In the passage which I am about to quote, it will be seen\r\nthat he predicts the constant increase of the Anglo-American power, but\r\nhe looks on the Rocky Mountains as their extreme western limit for many\r\nyears to come. He had evidently no expectation of himself seeing that\r\npower dominant along the Pacific as well as along the Atlantic coast. He\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"The distance from Lake Superior to the Gulf of Mexico extends from\r\nthe 47th to the 30th degree of latitude, a distance of more than 1,200\r\nmiles, as the bird flies. The frontier of the United States winds along\r\nthe whole of this immense line; sometimes falling within its limits,\r\nbut more frequently extending far beyond it into the waste. It has\r\nbeen calculated that the Whites, advance every year a mean distance of\r\nseventeen miles along the whole of this vast boundary. Obstacles, such\r\nas an unproductive district, a lake, or an Indian nation unexpectedly\r\nencountered, are sometimes met with. The advancing column then halts for\r\na while; its two extremities fall back upon themselves, and as soon as\r\nthey are re-united they proceed onwards. This gradual and continuous\r\nprogress of the European race towards the Rocky Mountains has the\r\nsolemnity of a Providential event: it is like a deluge of men rising\r\nunabatedly, and daily driven onwards by the hand of God.\r\n\r\n\"Within this first line of conquering settlers towns are built, and\r\nvast estates founded. In 1790 there were only a few thousand pioneers\r\nsprinkled along the valleys of the Mississippi: and at the present day\r\nthese valleys contain as many inhabitants as were to be found in the\r\nwhole Union in 1790. Their population amounts to nearly four millions.\r\nThe city of Washington was founded in 1800, in the very centre of the\r\nUnion; but such are the changes which have taken place, that it now\r\nstands at one of the extremities; and the delegates of the most remote\r\nWestern States are already obliged to perform a journey as long so that\r\nfrom Vienna to Paris.\r\n\r\n\"It must not, then, be imagined that the impulse of the British race in\r\nthe New World can be arrested. The dismemberment of the Union, and the\r\nhostilities which might ensue, the abolition of republican institutions,\r\nand the tyrannical government which might succeed it, may retard this\r\nimpulse, but they cannot prevent it from ultimately fulfilling the\r\ndestinies to which that race is reserved. No power upon earth can close\r\nupon the emigrants that fertile wilderness, which offers resources to\r\nall industry, and a refuge from all want. Future events, of whatever\r\nnature they may be, will not deprive the Americans of their climate or\r\nof their inland seas, or of their great rivers, or of their exuberant\r\nsoil. Nor will bad laws, revolutions, and anarchy be able to obliterate\r\nthat love of prosperity and that spirit of enterprise which seem to be\r\nthe distinctive characteristics of their race, or to extinguish that\r\nknowledge which guides them on their way.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, in the midst of the uncertain future, one event at least is sure.\r\nAt a period which may be said to be near (for we are speaking of the\r\nlife of a nation), the Anglo-Americans will alone cover the immense\r\nspace contained between the Polar regions and the Tropics, extending\r\nfrom the coast of the Atlantic to the shores of the Pacific Ocean; the\r\nterritory which will probably be occupied by the Anglo-Americans at\r\nsome future time, may be computed to equal three-quarters of Europe in\r\nextent. The climate of the Union is upon the whole preferable to that of\r\nEurope, and its natural advantages are not less great; it is therefore\r\nevident that its population will at some future time be proportionate to\r\nour own. Europe, divided as it is between so many different nations, and\r\ntorn as it has been by incessant wars and the barbarous manners of\r\nthe Middle Ages, has notwithstanding attained a population of 410\r\ninhabitants to the square league. What cause can prevent the United\r\nStates from having as numerous a population in time?\r\n\r\n\"The time will therefore come when one hundred and fifty millions of men\r\nwill be living in North America, equal in condition, the progeny of\r\none race, owing their origin to the same cause, and preserving the same\r\ncivilization, the same language, the same religion, the same habits, the\r\nsame manners, and imbued with the same opinions, propagated under the\r\nsame forms. The rest is uncertain, but this is certain; and it is a fact\r\nnew to the world, a fact fraught with such portentous consequences as to\r\nbaffle the efforts even of the imagination.\"\r\n\r\n[The original French of these passages will be found in the chapter on\r\n\"Quelles sont les chances de duree de l'Union Americaine--Quels dangers\r\nla menacent.\" in the third volume of the first part of De Tocqueville,\r\nand in the conclusion of the first part. They are (with others)\r\ncollected and translated by Mr. Alison, in his \"Essays,\" vol. iii. p.\r\n374.]\r\n\r\nLet us turn from the French statesman writing in 1835, to an English\r\nstatesman, who is justly regarded as the highest authority on all\r\nstatistical subjects, and who described the United States only seven\r\nyears ago. Macgregor [Macgregor's Commercial Statistics.] tells us--\r\n\r\n\"The States which, on the ratification of independence, formed the\r\nAmerican Republican Union, were thirteen, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\"Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York,\r\nNew Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nSouth Carolina, and Georgia.\" The foregoing thirteen states (THE\r\nWHOLE INHABITED TERRITORY OF WHICH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW SMALL\r\nSETTLEMENTS, WAS CONFINED TO THE REGION EXTENDING BETWEEN THE ALLEGHANY\r\nMOUNTAINS AND THE ATLANTIC) were those which existed at the period when\r\nthey became an acknowledged separate and independent federal sovereign\r\npower. The thirteen stripes of the standard or flag of the United\r\nStates, continue to represent the original number, The stars have\r\nmultiplied to twenty-six, [Fresh stars have dawned since this was\r\nwritten.] according as the number of States have increased.\r\n\r\n\"The territory of the thirteen original States of the Union, including\r\nMaine and Vermont, comprehended a superficies of 371,124 English square\r\nmiles; that of the whole United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,\r\n120,354; that of France, including Corsica, 214,910; that of the\r\nAustrian Empire, including Hungary and all the Imperial States, 257,540\r\nEnglish square miles.\r\n\r\n\"The present superficies of the twenty-six constitutional States of the\r\nAnglo-American Union, and the district of Columbia, and territories\r\nof Florida, include 1,029,025 square miles; to which if we add the\r\nnorth-west, or Wisconsin territory, east of the Mississippi, and bounded\r\nby Lake Superior on the north, and Michigan on the east, and occupying\r\nat least 100,000 square miles, and then add the great western region,\r\nnot yet well-defined territories, but at the most limited calculation\r\ncomprehending 700,000 square miles, the whole unbroken in its vast\r\nlength and breadth by foreign nations, comprehends a portion of the\r\nearth's surface equal to 1,729,025 English, or 1,296,770 geographical\r\nsquare miles.\"\r\n\r\nWe may add that the population of the States, when they declared their\r\nindependence, was about two millions and a half; it is now twenty-three\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nI have quoted Macgregor, not only on account of the clear and full view\r\nwhich he gives of the progress of America to the date when he wrote, but\r\nbecause his description may be contrasted with what the United States\r\nhave become even since his book appeared. Only three years after the\r\ntime when Macgregor thus wrote, the American President truly stated:--\r\n\r\n\"Within less than four years the annexation of Texas to the Union has\r\nbeen consummated; all conflicting title to the Oregon territory, south\r\nof the 49th degree of north latitude, adjusted; and New Mexico and\r\nUpper California have been acquired by treaty. The area of these several\r\nterritories contains 1,193,061 square miles, or 763,559,040 acres; while\r\nthe area of the remaining twenty-nine States, and the territory not yet\r\norganized into States east of the Rocky Mountains, contains 2,059,513\r\nsquare miles, or 1,318,126,058 acres. These estimates show that the\r\nterritories recently acquired, and over which our exclusive jurisdiction\r\nand dominion have been extended, constitute a country more than half\r\nas large as all that which was held by the United States before their\r\nacquisition. If Oregon be excluded from the estimate, there will still\r\nremain within the limits of Texas, New Mexico, and California, 851,598\r\nsquare miles, or 545,012,720 acres; being an addition equal to more than\r\none-third of all the territory owned by the United States before\r\ntheir acquisition; and, including Oregon, nearly as great an extent of\r\nterritory as the whole of Europe, Russia only excepted. THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\nSO LATELY THE FRONTIER OF OUR COUNTRY, IS NOW ONLY ITS CENTRE. With the\r\naddition of the late acquisitions, the United States are now estimated\r\nto be nearly as large as the whole of Europe. The extent of the\r\nsea-coast of Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico, is upwards of 400 miles;\r\nof the coast of Upper California, on the Pacific, of 970 miles; and of\r\nOregon, including the Straits of Fuca, of 650 miles; MAKING THE WHOLE\r\nEXTENT OF SEA-COAST ON THE PACIFIC 1,620 MILES; and the whole extent on\r\nboth the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico, 2,020 miles. The length of the\r\ncoast on the Atlantic, from the northern limits of the United States,\r\nround the Capes of Florida to the Sabine on the eastern boundary\r\nof Texas, is estimated to be 3,100 miles, so that the addition of\r\nsea-coast, including Oregon, is very nearly two-thirds as great as all\r\nwe possessed before; and, excluding Oregon, is an addition of 1,370\r\nmiles; being nearly equal to one-half of the extent of coast which we\r\npossessed before these acquisitions. We have now three great maritime\r\nfronts--on the Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific; making,\r\nin the whole, an extent of sea-coast exceeding 5,000 miles. This is\r\nthe extent of the sea-coast of the United States, not including bays,\r\nsounds, and small irregularities of the main shore, and of the sea\r\nislands. If these be included, the length of the shore line of coast,\r\nas estimated by the superintendent of the Coast Survey, in his report,\r\nwould be 33,063 miles.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of the power of the United States being then firmly\r\nplanted along the Pacific applies not only to the New World, but to\r\nthe Old. Opposite to San Francisco, on the coast of that ocean, lie\r\nthe wealthy but decrepit empires of China and Japan. Numerous groups of\r\nislets stud the larger part of the intervening sea, and form convenient\r\nstepping-stones for the progress of commerce or ambition. The\r\nintercourse of traffic between these ancient Asiatic monarchies, and the\r\nyoung Anglo-American Republic, must be rapid and extensive. Any attempt\r\nof the Chinese or Japanese rulers to check it, will only accelerate an\r\narmed collision. The American will either buy or force his way. Between\r\nsuch populations as that of China and Japan on the one side, and that\r\nof the United States on the other--the former haughty, formal, and\r\ninsolent, the latter bold, intrusive, and unscrupulous--causes of\r\nquarrel must, sooner or later, arise, The results of such a quarrel\r\ncannot be doubted. America will scarcely imitate the forbearance shown\r\nby England at the end of our late war with the Celestial Empire; and\r\nthe conquests of China and Japan by the fleets and armies of the United\r\nStates, are events which many now living are likely to witness. Compared\r\nwith the magnitude of such changes in the dominion of the Old World,\r\nthe certain ascendancy of the Anglo-Americans over Central and Southern\r\nAmerica, seems a matter of secondary importance. Well may we repeat De\r\nTocqueville's words, that the growing power of this commonwealth is, \"Un\r\nfait entierement nouveau dans le monde, et dont l'imagination ellememe\r\nne saurait saisir la portee.\" [These remarks were written in May 1851,\r\nand now, in May 1852, a powerful squadron of American war-steamers has\r\nbeen sent to Japan, for the ostensible purpose of securing protection\r\nfor the crews of American vessels shipwrecked on the Japanese coasts,\r\nbut also evidently for important ulterior purposes.]\r\n\r\nAn Englishman may look, and ought to look, on the growing grandeur\r\nof the Americans with no small degree of generous sympathy and\r\nsatisfaction. They, like ourselves, are members of the great Anglo-Saxon\r\nnation \"whose race and language are now overrunning the world from one\r\nend of it to the other.\" [Arnold.] and whatever differences of form of\r\ngovernment may exist between us and them; whatever reminiscences of the\r\ndays when, though brethren, we strove together, may rankle in the\r\nminds of us, the defeated party; we should cherish the bonds of common\r\nnationality that still exist between us. We should remember, as the\r\nAthenians remembered of the Spartans at a season of jealousy and\r\ntemptation, that our race is one, being of the same blood, speaking the\r\nsame language, having an essential resemblance in our institutions and\r\nusages, and worshipping in the temples of the same God. [HERODOTUS,\r\nviii. 144.] All this may and should be borne in mind. And yet an\r\nEnglishman can hardly watch the progress of America, without the\r\nregretful thought that America once was English, and that, but for the\r\nfolly of our rulers, she might be English still. It is true that\r\nthe commerce between the two countries has largely and beneficially\r\nincreased; but this is no proof that the increase would not have been\r\nstill greater, had the States remained integral portions of the same\r\ngreat empire. By giving a fair and just participation in political\r\nrights, these, \"the fairest possessions\" of the British crown, might\r\nhave been preserved to it. \"This ancient and most noble monarchy\" [Lord\r\nChatham.] would not have been dismembered; nor should we see that which\r\nought to be the right arm of our strength, now menacing us in every\r\npolitical crisis, as the most formidable rival of our commercial and\r\nmaritime ascendancy.\r\n\r\nThe war which rent away the North American colonies of England is, of\r\nall subjects in history, the most painful for an Englishman to dwell on.\r\nIt was commenced and carried on by the British ministry in iniquity and\r\nfolly, and it was concluded in disaster and shame. But the contemplation\r\nof it cannot be evaded by the historian, however much it may be\r\nabhorred. Nor can any military event be said to have exercised more\r\nimportant influence on the future fortunes of mankind, than the complete\r\ndefeat of Burgoyne's expedition in 1777; a defeat which rescued the\r\nrevolted colonists from certain subjection; and which, by inducing the\r\ncourts of France and Spain to attack England in their behalf, ensured\r\nthe independence of the United States, and the formation of that\r\ntrans-Atlantic power which, not only America, but both Europe and Asia,\r\nnow see and feel.\r\n\r\nStill, in proceeding to describe this \"decisive battle of the world,\"\r\na very brief recapitulation of the earlier events of the war may be\r\nsufficient; nor shall I linger unnecessarily on a painful theme.\r\n\r\nThe five northern colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island,\r\nNew Hampshire, and Vermont, usually classed together as the New\r\nEngland colonies, were the strongholds of the insurrection against the\r\nmother-country. The feeling of resistance was less vehement and\r\ngeneral in the central settlement of New York; and still less so in\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland, and the other colonies of the south, although\r\neverywhere it was formidably active. Virginia should, perhaps, be\r\nparticularised for the zeal which its leading men displayed in the\r\nAmerican cause; but it was among the descendants of the stern Puritans\r\nthat the spirit of Cromwell and Vane breathed in all its fervour; it was\r\nfrom the New Englanders that the first armed opposition to the British\r\ncrown had been offered; and it was by them that the most stubborn\r\ndetermination to fight to the last, rather than waive a single right or\r\nprivilege, had been displayed. In 1775, they had succeeded in forcing\r\nthe British troops to evacuate Boston; and the events of 1776 had made\r\nNew York (which the royalists captured in that year) the principal basis\r\nof operations for the armies of the mother-country.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map will show that the Hudson river, which falls into\r\nthe Atlantic at New York, runs down from the north at the back of the\r\nNew England States, forming an angle of about forty-five degrees with\r\nthe line of the coast of the Atlantic, along which the New England\r\nstates are situate. Northward of the Hudson, we see a small chain of\r\nlakes communicating with the Canadian frontier. It is necessary to\r\nattend closely to these geographical points, in order to understand the\r\nplan of the operations which the English attempted in 1777, and which\r\nthe battle of Saratoga defeated.\r\n\r\nThe English had a considerable force in Canada; and in 1776 had\r\ncompletely repulsed an attack which the Americans had made upon that\r\nprovince. The British ministry resolved to avail themselves, in the next\r\nyear, of the advantage which the occupation of Canada gave them, not\r\nmerely for the purpose of defence, but for the purpose of striking a\r\nvigorous and crushing blow against the revolted colonies. With this\r\nview, the army in Canada was largely reinforced. Seven thousand veteran\r\ntroops were sent out from England, with a corps of artillery abundantly\r\nsupplied, and led by select and experienced officers. Large quantities\r\nof military stores were also furnished for the equipment of the Canadian\r\nvolunteers, who were expected to join the expedition. It was intended\r\nthat the force thus collected should march southward by the line of the\r\nlakes, and thence along the banks of the Hudson river. The British army\r\nin New York (or a large detachment of it) was to make a simultaneous\r\nmovement northward, up the line of the Hudson, and the two expeditions\r\nwere to unite at Albany, a town on that river. By these operations all\r\ncommunication between the northern colonies and those of the centre and\r\nsouth would be cut off. An irresistible force would be concentrated,\r\nso as to crush all further opposition in New England; and when this was\r\ndone, it was believed that the other colonies would speedily submit. The\r\nAmericans had no troops in the field that seemed able to baffle these\r\nmovements. Their principal army, under Washington, was occupied in\r\nwatching over Pennsylvania and the south. At any rate it was believed\r\nthat, in order to oppose the plan intended for the new campaign, the\r\ninsurgents must risk a pitched battle, in which the superiority of\r\nthe royalists, in numbers, in discipline, and in equipment, seemed to\r\npromise to the latter a crowning victory. Without question the plan\r\nwas ably formed; and had the success of the execution been equal to the\r\ningenuity of the design, the re-conquest or submission of the thirteen\r\nUnited States must, in all human probability, have followed; and the\r\nindependence which they proclaimed in 1776 would have been extinguished\r\nbefore it existed a second year. No European power had as yet come\r\nforward to aid America. It is true that England was generally regarded\r\nwith jealousy and ill-will, and was thought to have acquired, at the\r\ntreaty of Paris, a preponderance of dominion which was perilous to the\r\nbalance of power; but though many were willing to wound, none had yet\r\nventured to strike; and America, if defeated in 1777, would have been\r\nsuffered to fall unaided.\r\n\r\n[In Lord Albemarle's \"Memoirs of the Marquis of Rockingham.\" is\r\ncontained the following remarkable state paper, drawn up by King George\r\nIII himself respecting the plan of Burgoyne's expedition. The original\r\nis in the king's own hand.\r\n\r\n\"REMARKS ON THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR FROM CANADA.\r\n\r\n\"The outlines of the plan seem to be on a proper foundation. The rank\r\nand file of the army now in Canada (including the 11th Regiment of\r\nBritish, M'Clean's corps, the Brunswicks and Hanover), amount to 10,527;\r\nadd the eleven additional companies and four hundred Hanover Chasseurs,\r\nthe total will be 11,443.\r\n\r\n\"As sickness and other contingencies must be expected, I should think\r\nnot above 7,000 effectives can be spared over Lake Champlain; for it\r\nwould be highly imprudent to run any risk in Canada.\r\n\r\n\"The fixing the stations of those left in the province may not be quite\r\nright, though the plan proposed may be recommended. Indians must be\r\nemployed, and this measure must be avowedly directed, and Carleton must\r\nbe in the strongest manner directed that the Apollo shall be ready by\r\nthat day, to receive Burgoyne.\r\n\r\n\"The magazines must be formed with the greatest expedition, at Crown\r\nPoint.\r\n\r\n\"If possible, possession must be taken of Lake George, and nothing but\r\nan absolute impossibility of succeeding in this, can be an excuse for\r\nproceeding by South Bay and Skeenborough.\r\n\r\n\"As Sir W. Howe does not think of acting from Rhode island into the\r\nMassachusets, the force from Canada must join him in Albany.\r\n\r\n\"The diversion on the Mohawk River ought at least to be strengthened by\r\nthe addition of the four hundred Hanover Chasseurs.\r\n\r\n\"The Ordnance ought to furnish a complete proportion of intrenching\r\ntools.\r\n\r\n\"The provisions ought to be calculated for a third more than the\r\neffective soldiery, and the General ordered to avoid delivering these\r\nwhen the army can be subsisted by the country. Burgoyne certainly\r\ngreatly undervalues the German recruits.\r\n\r\n\"The idea of carrying the army by sea to Sir W. Howe, would certainly\r\nrequire the leaving a much larger part of it in Canada, as in that case\r\nthe rebel army would divide that province from the immense one under Sir\r\nW. Howe. I greatly dislike this last idea.\"]\r\n\r\nBurgoyne had gained celebrity by some bold and dashing exploits in\r\nPortugal during the last war; he was personally as brave an officer as\r\never headed British troops; he had considerable skill as a tactician;\r\nand his general intellectual abilities and acquirements were of a high\r\norder. He had several very able and experienced officers under him,\r\namong whom were Major-General Phillips and Brigadier-General Fraser. His\r\nregular troops amounted, exclusively of the corps of artillery, to about\r\nseven thousand two hundred men, rank and file. Nearly half of these were\r\nGermans. He had also an auxiliary force of from two to three thousand\r\nCanadians. He summoned the warriors of several tribes of the Red Indians\r\nnear the western lakes to join his army. Much eloquence was poured\r\nforth, both in America and in England, in denouncing the use of these\r\nsavage auxiliaries. Yet Burgoyne seems to have done no more than\r\nMontcalm, Wolfe, and other French, American, and English generals had\r\ndone before him. But, in truth, the lawless ferocity of the Indians,\r\ntheir unskilfulness in regular action, and the utter impossibility of\r\nbringing them under any discipline, made their services of little or no\r\nvalue in times of difficulty: while the indignation which their\r\noutrages inspired, went far to rouse the whole population of the invaded\r\ndistricts into active hostilities against Burgoyne's force.\r\n\r\nBurgoyne assembled his troops and confederates near the river Bouquet,\r\non the west side of Lake Champlain. He then, on the 21st of June, 1777,\r\ngave his Red Allies a war-feast, and harangued them on the necessity of\r\nabstaining from their usual cruel practices against unarmed people and\r\nprisoners. At the same time he published a pompous manifesto to the\r\nAmericans, in which he threatened the refractory with all the horrors\r\nof war, Indian as well as European. The army proceeded by water to\r\nCrown Point, a fortification which the Americans held at the northern\r\nextremity of the inlet by which the water from Lake George is conveyed\r\nto Lake Champlain. He landed here without opposition; but the reduction\r\nof Ticonderoga, a fortification about twelve miles to the south of Crown\r\nPoint, was a more serious matter, and was supposed to be the critical\r\npart of the expedition. Ticonderoga commanded the passage along the\r\nlakes, and was considered to be the key to the route which Burgoyne\r\nwished to follow. The English had been repulsed in an attack on it\r\nin the war with the French in 1768 with severe loss. But Burgoyne now\r\ninvested it with great skill; and the American general, St. Clair, who\r\nhad only an ill-equipped army of about three thousand men, evacuated it\r\non the 5th of July. It seems evident that a different course would have\r\ncaused the destruction or capture of his whole army; which, weak as it\r\nwas, was the chief force then in the field for the protection of the New\r\nEngland states. When censured by some of his countrymen for abandoning\r\nTiconderoga, St. Clair truly replied, \"that he had lost a post, but\r\nsaved a province.\" Burgoyne's troops pursued the retiring Americans,\r\ngained several advantages over them, and took a large part of their\r\nartillery and military stores.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the British in these engagements was trifling. The army\r\nmoved southward along Lake George to Skenesborough; and thence slowly,\r\nand with great difficulty, across a broken country, full of creeks and\r\nmarshes, and clogged by the enemy with felled trees and other obstacles,\r\nto Fort Edward, on the Hudson river, the American troops continuing to\r\nretire before them.\r\n\r\nBurgoyne reached the left bank of the Hudson river on the 30th of July.\r\nHitherto he had overcome every difficulty which the enemy and the nature\r\nof the country had placed in his way. His army was in excellent order\r\nand in the highest spirits; and the peril of the expedition seemed over,\r\nwhen they were once on the bank of the river which was to be the channel\r\nof communication between them and the British army in the south. But\r\ntheir feelings, and those of the English nation in general when their\r\nsuccesses were announced, may best be learned from a contemporary\r\nwriter. Burke, in the \"Annual Register\" for 1777, describes them thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Such was the rapid torrent of success, which swept everything away\r\nbefore the northern army in its onset. It is not to be wondered at,\r\nif both officers and private men were highly elated with their good\r\nfortune, and deemed that and their prowess to be irresistible; if they\r\nregarded their enemy with the greatest contempt; considered their own\r\ntoils to be nearly at an end; Albany to be already in their hands; and\r\nthe reduction of the northern provinces to be rather a matter of some\r\ntime, than an arduous task full of difficulty and danger.\r\n\r\n\"At home, the joy and exultation was extreme; not only at court, but\r\nwith all those who hoped or wished the unqualified subjugation, and\r\nunconditional submission of the colonies. The loss in reputation was\r\ngreater to the Americans, and capable of more fatal consequences,\r\nthan even that of ground, of posts, of artillery, or of men. All the\r\ncontemptuous and most degrading charges which had been made by their\r\nenemies, of their wanting the resolution and abilities of men, even\r\nin their defence of whatever was dear to them, were now repeated and\r\nbelieved. Those who still regarded them as men, and who had not yet lost\r\nall affection to them as brethren, who also retained hopes that a happy\r\nreconciliation upon constitutional principles, without sacrificing\r\nthe dignity or the just authority of government on the one side, or\r\na dereliction of the rights of freemen on the other, was not even now\r\nimpossible, notwithstanding their favourable dispositions in general,\r\ncould not help feeling upon this occasion that the Americans sunk not a\r\nlittle in their estimation. It was not difficult to diffuse an opinion\r\nthat the war in effect was over; and that any further resistance could\r\nserve only to render the terms of their submission the worse. Such were\r\nsome of the immediate effects of the loss of those grand keys of North\r\nAmerica, Ticonderoga and the lakes.\"\r\n\r\nThe astonishment and alarm which these events produced among the\r\nAmericans were naturally great; but in the midst of their disasters none\r\nof the colonists showed any disposition to submit. The local governments\r\nof the New England States, as well as the Congress, acted with vigour\r\nand firmness in their efforts to repel the enemy. General Gates was sent\r\nto take command of the army at Saratoga; and Arnold, a favourite leader\r\nof the Americans, was despatched by Washington to act under him,\r\nwith reinforcements of troops and guns from the main American army.\r\nBurgoyne's employment of the Indians now produced the worst possible\r\neffects. Though he laboured hard to check the atrocities which they\r\nwere accustomed to commit, he could not prevent the occurrence of many\r\nbarbarous outrages, repugnant both to the feelings of humanity and to\r\nthe laws of civilized warfare. The American commanders took care that\r\nthe reports of these excesses should be circulated far and wide, well\r\nknowing that they would make the stern New Englanders not droop, but\r\nrage. Such was their effect; and though, when each man looked upon his\r\nwife, his children, his sisters, or his aged parents, the thought of the\r\nmerciless Indian \"thirsting for the blood of man, woman, and child,\"\r\nof \"the cannibal savage torturing, murdering, roasting, and eating the\r\nmangled victims of his barbarous battles,\" [Lord Chatham's speech on\r\nthe employment of Indians in the war.] \"might raise terror in the bravest\r\nbreasts; this very terror produced a directly contrary effect to causing\r\nsubmission to the royal army. It was seen that the few friends of the\r\nroyal cause, as well as its enemies, were liable to be the victims of\r\nthe indiscriminate rage of the savages;\" [See in the \"Annual Register\"\r\nfor 1777, p.117, the \"Narrative of the Murder of Miss M'Crea, the\r\ndaughter of an American loyalist.\"] and thus \"the inhabitants of the\r\nopen and frontier countries had no choice of acting: they had no means\r\nof security left, but by abandoning their habitations and taking up\r\narms. Every man saw the necessity of becoming a temporary soldier, not\r\nonly for his own security, but for the protection and defence of those\r\nconnexions which are dearer than life itself. Thus an army was poured\r\nforth by the woods, mountains, and marshes, which in this part were\r\nthickly sown with plantations and villages. The Americans recalled their\r\ncourage; and when their regular army seemed to be entirely wasted,\r\nthe spirit of the country produced a much greater and more formidable\r\nforce.\" [Burke.]\r\n\r\nWhile resolute recruits, accustomed to the use of fire-arms, and all\r\npartially trained by service in the provincial militias, were thus\r\nflocking to the standard of Gates and Arnold at Saratoga; and while\r\nBurgoyne was engaged at Port Edward in providing the means for the\r\nfurther advance of his army through the intricate and hostile country\r\nthat still lay before him, two events occurred, in each of which the\r\nBritish sustained loss, and the Americans obtained advantage, the moral\r\neffects of which were even more important than the immediate result\r\nof the encounters. When Burgoyne left Canada, General St. Leger was\r\ndetached from that province with a mixed force of about one thousand\r\nmen, and some light field-pieces, across Lake Ontario against Fort\r\nStanwix, which the Americans held. After capturing this, he was to\r\nmarch along the Mohawk river to its confluence with the Hudson, between\r\nSaratoga and Albany, where his force and that of Burgoyne were to unite.\r\nBut, after some successes, St. Leger was obliged to retreat, and to\r\nabandon his tents and large quantities of stores to the garrison. At the\r\nvery time that General Burgoyne heard of this disaster, he experienced\r\none still more severe in the defeat of Colonel Baum with a large\r\ndetachment of German troops at Benington, whither Burgoyne had sent them\r\nfor the purpose of capturing some magazines of provisions, of which\r\nthe British army stood greatly in need. The Americans, augmented by\r\ncontinual accessions of strength, succeeded, after many attacks, in\r\nbreaking this corps, which fled into the woods, and left its commander\r\nmortally wounded on the field: they then marched against a force of five\r\nhundred grenadiers and light infantry, which was advancing to Colonel\r\nBaum's assistance under Lieutenant-Colonel Breyman; who, after a gallant\r\nresistance, was obliged to retreat on the main army. The British loss\r\nin these two actions exceeded six hundred men: and a party of American\r\nloyalists, on their way to join the army, having attached themselves to\r\nColonel Baum's corps, were destroyed with it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these reverses, which added greatly to the spirit and\r\nnumbers of the American forces, Burgoyne determined to advance. It was\r\nimpossible any longer to keep up his communications with Canada by\r\nway of the lakes, so as to supply his army on his southward march; but\r\nhaving by unremitting exertions collected provisions for thirty days, he\r\ncrossed the Hudson by means of a bridge of rafts, and, marching a short\r\ndistance along its western bank, he encamped on the 14th of September on\r\nthe heights of Saratoga, about sixteen miles from Albany. The Americans\r\nhad fallen back from Saratoga, and were now strongly posted near\r\nStillwater, about half way between Saratoga and Albany, and showed a\r\ndetermination to recede no farther.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lord Howe, with the bulk of the British army that had lain\r\nat New York, had sailed away to the Delaware, and there commenced\r\na campaign against Washington, in which the English general took\r\nPhiladelphia, and gained other showy, but unprofitable successes,\r\nBut Sir Henry Clinton, a brave and skilful officer, was left with a\r\nconsiderable force at New York; and he undertook the task of moving up\r\nthe Hudson to co-operate with Burgoyne. Clinton was obliged for this\r\npurpose to wait for reinforcements which had been promised from England,\r\nand these did not arrive till September. As soon as he received them,\r\nClinton embarked about 3,000 of his men on a flotilla, convoyed by some\r\nships of war under Commander Hotham, and proceeded to force his may up\r\nthe river, but it was long before he was able to open any communication\r\nwith Burgoyne.\r\n\r\nThe country between Burgoyne's position at Saratoga and that of\r\nthe Americans at Stillwater was rugged, and seamed with creeks and\r\nwater-courses; but after great labour in making bridges and temporary\r\ncauseways, the British army moved forward. About four miles from\r\nSaratoga, on the afternoon of the 19th of September, a sharp encounter\r\ntook place between part of the English right wing, under Burgoyne\r\nhimself, and a strong body of the enemy, under Gates and Arnold. The\r\nconflict lasted till sunset. The British remained masters of the field;\r\nbut the loss on each side was nearly equal (from five hundred to six\r\nhundred men); and the spirits of the Americans were greatly raised by\r\nhaving withstood the best regular troops of the English army. Burgoyne\r\nnow halted again, and strengthened his position by field-works and\r\nredoubts; and the Americans also improved their defences. The two armies\r\nremained nearly within cannon-shot of each other for a considerable\r\ntime, during which Burgoyne was anxiously looking for intelligence of\r\nthe promised expedition from New York, which, according to the original\r\nplan, ought by this time to have been approaching Albany from the south.\r\nAt last, a messenger from Clinton made his way, with great difficulty,\r\nto Burgoyne's camp, and brought the information that Clinton was on his\r\nway up the Hudson to attack the American forts which barred the passage\r\nup that river to Albany. Burgoyne, in reply, on the 30th of September,\r\nurged Clinton to attack the forts as speedily as possible, stating that\r\nthe effect of such an attack, or even the semblance of it, would be\r\nto move the American army from its position before his own troops. By\r\nanother messenger, who reached Clinton on the 5th of October, Burgoyne\r\ninformed his brother general that he had lost his communications with\r\nCanada, but had provisions which would last him till the 20th. Burgoyne\r\ndescribed himself as strongly posted, and stated that though the\r\nAmericans in front of him were strongly posted also, he made no doubt\r\nof being able to force them, and making his way to Albany; but that he\r\ndoubted whether he could subsist there, as the country was drained of\r\nprovisions. He wished Clinton to meet him there, and to keep open a\r\ncommunication with New York. [See the letters of General Clinton to\r\nGeneral Harvey, published by Lord Albemarle in his \"Memoirs of the\r\nMarquis of Rockingham,\" vol. ii. p. 335, ET SEQ.]\r\n\r\nBurgoyne had over-estimated his resources, and in the very beginning of\r\nOctober found difficulty and distress pressing him hard.\r\n\r\nThe Indians and Canadians began to desert him; while, on the other hand,\r\nGates's army was continually reinforced by fresh bodies of the militia.\r\nAn expeditionary force was detached by the Americans, which made a bold,\r\nthough unsuccessful, attempt to retake Ticonderoga. And finding the\r\nnumber and spirit of the enemy to increase daily, and his own stores of\r\nprovision to diminish, Burgoyne determined on attacking the Americans\r\nin front of him, and by dislodging them from their position, to gain the\r\nmeans of moving upon Albany, or at least of relieving his troops from\r\nthe straitened position in which they were cooped up.\r\n\r\nBurgoyne's force was now reduced to less than 6,000 men. The right of\r\nhis camp was on some high ground a little to the west of the river;\r\nthence his entrenchments extended along the lower ground to the bank of\r\nthe Hudson, the line of their front being nearly at a right angle with\r\nthe course of the stream. The lines were fortified with redoubts and\r\nfield-works, and on a height on the bank of the extreme right a strong\r\nredoubt was reared, and entrenchments, in a horse-shoe form, thrown\r\nup. The Hessians, under Colonel Breyman, were stationed here, forming\r\na flank defence to Burgoyne's main army. The numerical force of the\r\nAmericans was now greater than the British even in regular troops, and\r\nthe numbers of the militia and volunteers which had joined Gates and\r\nArnold were greater still.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lincoln with 2,000 New England troops, had reached the American\r\ncamp on the 29th of September. Gates gave him the command of the\r\nright wing, and took in person the command of the left wing, which was\r\ncomposed of two brigades under Generals Poor and Leonard, of Colonel\r\nMorgan's rifle corps, and part of the fresh New England Militia. The\r\nwhole of the American lines had been ably fortified under the direction\r\nof the celebrated Polish general, Kosciusko, who was now serving as a\r\nvolunteer in Gates's army. The right of the American position, that\r\nis to say, the part of it nearest to the river, was too strong to be\r\nassailed with any prospect of success: and Burgoyne therefore determined\r\nto endeavour to force their left. For this purpose he formed a column\r\nof 1,500 regular troops, with two twelve-pounders, two howitzers and\r\nsix six-pounders. He headed this in person, having Generals Phillips,\r\nReidesel, and Fraser under him. The enemy's force immediately in front\r\nof his lines was so strong that he dared not weaken the troops who\r\nguarded them, by detaching any more to strengthen his column of attack.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 7th of October that Burgoyne led his column forward;\r\nand on the preceding day, the 6th, Clinton had successfully executed\r\na brilliant enterprise against the two American forts which barred his\r\nprogress up the Hudson. He had captured them both, with severe loss to\r\nthe American forces opposed to him; he had destroyed the fleet which the\r\nAmericans had been forming on the Hudson, under the protection of their\r\nforts; and the upward river was laid open to his squadron. He had also,\r\nwith admirable skill and industry, collected in small vessels, such\r\nas could float within a few miles of Albany, provisions sufficient to\r\nsupply Burgoyne's Army for six months. [See Clinton's letters in Lord\r\nAlbemarle, p. 337.] He was now only a hundred and fifty-six miles\r\ndistant from Burgoyne; and a detachment of 1,700 men actually advanced\r\nwithin forty miles of Albany. Unfortunately Burgoyne and Clinton were\r\neach ignorant of the other's movements; but if Burgoyne had won his\r\nbattle on the 7th, he must on advancing have soon learned the tidings of\r\nClinton's success, and Clinton would have heard of his. A junction would\r\nsoon have been made of the two victorious armies, and the great objects\r\nof the campaign might yet have been accomplished. All depended on\r\nthe fortune of the column with which Burgoyne, on the eventful 7th of\r\nOctober, 1777, advanced against the American position. There were\r\nbrave men, both English and German, in its ranks; and in particular it\r\ncomprised one of the best bodies of grenadiers in the British service.\r\n[I am indebted for many of the details of the battle, to Mr Lossing's\r\n\"Field-book of the Revolution.\"]\r\n\r\nBurgoyne pushed forward some bodies of irregular troops to distract the\r\nenemy's attention; and led his column to within three-quarters of a mile\r\nfrom the left of Gates's camp, and then deployed his men into line. The\r\ngrenadiers under Major Ackland, and the artillery under Major Williams,\r\nwere drawn up on the left; a corps of Germans under General Reidesel,\r\nand some British troops under General Phillips, were in the centre; and\r\nthe English light infantry, and the 24th regiment under Lord Balcarres\r\nand General Fraser, were on the right. But Gates did not wait to be\r\nattacked; and directly the British line was formed and began to advance,\r\nthe American general, with admirable skill, caused General Poor's\r\nbrigade of New York and New Hampshire troops, and part of General\r\nLeonard's brigade, to make a sudden and vehement rush against its left,\r\nand at the same time sent Colonel Morgan, with his rifle corps and\r\nother troops, amounting to 1,500, to turn the right of the English. The\r\ngrenadiers under Ackland sustained the charge of superior numbers nobly.\r\nBut Gates sent more Americans forward, and in a few minutes the action\r\nbecame general along the centre, so as to prevent the Germans from\r\ndetaching any help to the grenadiers. Morgan, with his riflemen, was now\r\npressing Lord Balcarres and General Fraser hard, and fresh masses of the\r\nenemy were observed advancing from their extreme left, with the evident\r\nintention of forcing the British right, and cutting off its retreat. The\r\nEnglish light infantry and the 24th now fell back, and formed an oblique\r\nsecond line, which enabled them to baffle this manoeuvre, and also to\r\nsuccour their comrades in the left wing, the gallant grenadiers, who\r\nwere overpowered by superior numbers, and, but for this aid, must have\r\nbeen cut to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe contest now was fiercely maintained on both sides. The English\r\ncannon were repeatedly taken and retaken; but when the grenadiers near\r\nthem were forced back by the weight of superior numbers, one of the guns\r\nwas permanently captured by the Americans, and turned upon the English.\r\nMajor Williams and Major Ackland were both made prisoners, and in\r\nthis part of the field the advantage of the Americans was decided. The\r\nBritish centre still held its ground; but now it was that the American\r\ngeneral Arnold appeared upon the scene, and did more for his countrymen\r\nthan whole battalions could have effected. Arnold, when the decisive\r\nengagement of the 7th of October commenced, had been deprived of his\r\ncommand by Gates, in consequence of a quarrel between them about the\r\naction of the 19th of September. He had listened for a short time in the\r\nAmerican camp to the thunder of the battle, in which he had no military\r\nright to take part, either as commander or as combatant. But his excited\r\nspirit could not long endure such a state of inaction. He called for his\r\nhorse, a powerful brown charger, and springing on it, galloped furiously\r\nto where the fight seemed to be the thickest. Gates saw him, and sent\r\nan aide-de-camp to recall him; but Arnold spurred far in advance, and\r\nplaced himself at the head of three regiments which had formerly been\r\nunder him, and which welcomed their old commander with joyous cheers. He\r\nled them instantly upon the British centre; and then galloping along the\r\nAmerican line, he issued orders for a renewed and a closer attack, which\r\nwere obeyed with alacrity, Arnold himself setting the example of the\r\nmost daring personal bravery, and charging more than once, sword in\r\nhand, into the English ranks. On the British side the officers did\r\ntheir duty nobly; but General Fraser was the most eminent of them all,\r\nrestoring order wherever the line began to waver, and infusing fresh\r\ncourage into his men by voice and example. Mounted on an iron-grey\r\ncharger, and dressed in the full uniform of a general officer, he was\r\nconspicuous to foes as well as to friends. The American Colonel Morgan\r\nthought that the fate of the battle rested on this gallant man's life,\r\nand calling several of his best marksman round him, pointed Fraser out,\r\nand said: \"That officer is General Fraser; I admire him, but he must\r\ndie. Our victory depends on it. Take your stations in that clump of\r\nbushes, and do your duty.\" Within five minutes Fraser fell mortally\r\nwounded, and was carried to the British camp by two grenadiers. Just\r\npreviously to his being struck by the fatal bullet, one rifle-ball had\r\ncut the crupper of his saddle and smother had passed through his horse's\r\nmane close behind the ears. His aide-de-camp had noticed this, and said:\r\n\"It is evident that you are marked out for particular aim; would it not\r\nbe prudent; for you to retire from this place?\" Fraser replied: \"My duty\r\nforbids me to fly from danger;\" and the next moment he fell. [Lossing.]\r\n\r\nBurgoyne's whole force was now compelled to retreat towards their camp;\r\nthe left and centre were in complete disorder, but the light infantry\r\nand the 24th checked the fury of the assailants, and the remains of\r\nthe column with great difficulty effected their return to their camp;\r\nleaving six of their cannons in the possession of the enemy, and great\r\nnumbers of killed and wounded on the field; and especially a large\r\nproportion of the artillerymen, who had stood to their guns until shot\r\ndown or bayoneted beside them by the advancing Americans.\r\n\r\nBurgoyne's column had been defeated, but the action was not yet over.\r\nThe English had scarcely entered the camp, when the Americans,\r\npursuing their success, assaulted it in several places with remarkable\r\nimpetuosity, rushing in upon the intrenchments and redoubts through a\r\nsevere fire of grape-shot and musketry. Arnold especially, who on this\r\nday appeared maddened with the thirst of combat and carnage, urged on\r\nthe attack against a part of the intrenchments which was occupied by the\r\nlight infantry under Lord Balcarres. [Botta's American War, book viii.]\r\nBut the English received him with vigour and spirit. The struggle here\r\nwas obstinate and sanguinary. At length, as it grew towards evening,\r\nArnold, having forced all obstacles, entered the works with some of the\r\nmost fearless of his followers. But in this critical moment of glory and\r\ndanger, he received a painful wound in the same leg which had already\r\nbeen injured at the assault on Quebec. To his bitter regret he was\r\nobliged to be carried back. His party still continued the attack, but\r\nthe English also continued their obstinate resistance, and at last\r\nnight fell, and the assailants withdrew from this quarter of the British\r\nintrenchments. But, in another part the attack had been more successful.\r\nA body of the Americans, under Colonel Brooke, forced their way in\r\nthrough a part of the horse-shoe intrenchments on the extreme right,\r\nwhich was defended by the Hessian reserve under Colonel Breyman. The\r\nGermans resisted well, and Breyman died in defence of his post; but the\r\nAmericans made good the ground which they had won, and captured baggage,\r\ntents, artillery, and a store of ammunition, which they were greatly in\r\nneed of. They had by establishing themselves on this point, acquired the\r\nmeans of completely turning the right flank of the British, and gaining\r\ntheir rear. To prevent this calamity, Burgoyne effected during the night\r\nan entire change of position. With great skill he removed his whole army\r\nto some heights near the river, a little northward of the former camp,\r\nand he there drew up his men, expecting to be attacked on the following\r\nday. But Gates was resolved not to risk the certain triumph which\r\nhis success had already secured for him. He harassed the English with\r\nskirmishes, but attempted no regular attack. Meanwhile he detached\r\nbodies of troops on both sides of the Hudson to prevent the British from\r\nrecrossing that river, and to bar their retreat. When night fell,\r\nit became absolutely necessary for Burgoyne to retire again, and,\r\naccordingly, the troops were marched through a stormy and rainy night\r\ntowards Saratoga, abandoning their sick and wounded, and the greater\r\npart of their baggage to the enemy.\r\n\r\nBefore the rear-guard quitted the camp, the last sad honours were paid\r\nto the brave General Fraser, who expired on the day after the action.\r\n\r\nHe had, almost with his last breath, expressed a wish to be buried in\r\nthe redoubt which had formed the part of the British lines where he had\r\nbeen stationed, but which had now been abandoned by the English, and\r\nwas within full range of the cannon which the advancing Americans were\r\nrapidly placing in position to bear upon Burgoyne's force. Burgoyne\r\nresolved, nevertheless, to comply with the dying wish of his comrade;\r\nand the interment took place under circumstances the most affecting\r\nthat have ever marked a soldier's funeral. Still more interesting is\r\nthe narrative of Lady Ackland's passage from the British to the American\r\ncamp, after the battle, to share the captivity and alleviate the\r\nsufferings of her husband who had been severely wounded, and left in the\r\nenemy's power. The American historian, Lossing, has described both these\r\ntouching episodes of the campaign, in a spirit that does honour to the\r\nwriter as well as to his subject. After narrating the death of General\r\nFraser on the 8th of October, he says that \"It was just at sunset, on\r\nthat calm October evening, that the corpse of General Fraser was carried\r\nup the hill to the place of burial within the 'great redoubt.' It was\r\nattended only by the military members of his family and Mr. Brudenell,\r\nthe chaplain; yet the eyes of hundreds of both armies followed the\r\nsolemn procession, while the Americans, ignorant of its true character,\r\nkept up a constant cannonade upon the redoubt. The chaplain, unawed by\r\nthe danger to which he was exposed, as the cannon-balls that struck the\r\nhill threw the loose soil over him, pronounced the impressive funeral\r\nservice of the Church of England with an unfaltering voice. The growing\r\ndarkness added solemnity to the scene. Suddenly the irregular firing\r\nceased, and the solemn voice of a single cannon, at measured intervals,\r\nboomed along the valley, and awakened the responses of the hills. It was\r\na minute gun fired by the Americans in honour of the gallant dead. The\r\nmoment the information was given that the gathering at the redoubt was a\r\nfuneral company, fulfilling, at imminent peril, the last-breathed wishes\r\nof the noble Fraser, orders were issued to withhold the cannonade with\r\nballs, and to render military homage to the fallen brave.\r\n\r\n\"The case of Major Ackland and his heroic wife presents kindred\r\nfeatures. He belonged to the grenadiers, and was an accomplished\r\nsoldier. His wife accompanied him to Canada in 1776; and during the\r\nwhole campaign of that year, and until his return to England after the\r\nsurrender of Burgoyne, in the autumn of 1777, endured all the hardships,\r\ndangers, and privations of an active campaign in an enemy's country. At\r\nChambly, on the Sorel, she attended him in illness, in a miserable\r\nhut; and when he was wounded in the battle of Hubbardton, Vermont\r\nshe hastened to him at Henesborough from Montreal, where she had been\r\npersuaded to remain, and resolved to follow the army hereafter. Just\r\nbefore crossing the Hudson, she and her husband had had a narrow escape\r\nfrom losing their lives in consequence of their tent accidentally taking\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"During the terrible engagement of the 7th October, she heard all the\r\ntumult and dreadful thunder of the battle in which her husband was\r\nengaged; and when, on the morning of the 8th, the British fell back in\r\nconfusion to their new position, she, with the other women, was obliged\r\nto take refuge among the dead and dying; for the tents were all struck,\r\nand hardly a shed was left standing. Her husband was wounded, and a\r\nprisoner in the American camp. That gallant officer was shot through\r\nboth legs. When Poor and Learned's troops assaulted the grenadiers and\r\nartillery on the British left, on the afternoon of the 7th, Wilkinson,\r\nGates's adjutant-general, while pursuing the flying enemy when they\r\nabandoned their battery, heard a feeble voice exclaim 'Protect me,\r\nsir, against that boy.' He turned and saw a lad with a musket taking\r\ndeliberate aim at a wounded British officer, lying in a corner of a low\r\nfence. Wilkinson ordered the boy to desist, and discovered the wounded\r\nman to be Major Ackland. He had him conveyed to the quarters of General\r\nPoor (now the residence of Mr. Neilson) on the heights, where every\r\nattention was paid to his wants.\r\n\r\n\"When the intelligence that he was wounded and a prisoner reached his\r\nwife, she was greatly distressed, and, by the advice of her friend,\r\nBaron Reidesel, resolved to visit the American camp, and implore the\r\nfavour of a personal attendance upon her husband. On the 9th she sent\r\na message to Burgoyne by Lord Petersham, his aide-de-camp, asking\r\npermission to depart. 'Though I was ready to believe,' says Burgoyne,\r\n'that patience and fortitude, in a supreme degree, were to be found,\r\nas well as every other virtue, under the most tender forms, I was\r\nastonished at this proposal. After so long an agitation of spirits,\r\nexhausted not only for want of rest, but absolutely want of food,\r\ndrenched in rain for twelve hours together, that a woman should be\r\ncapable of such an undertaking as delivering herself to an enemy,\r\nprobably in the night, and uncertain of what hands she might fall into,\r\nappeared an effort above human nature. The assistance I was able to give\r\nwas small indeed. I had not even a cup of wine to offer her. All I could\r\nfurnish her with was an open boat, and a few lines, written upon dirty\r\nwet paper, to General Gates, recommending her to his protection.'\r\nThe following is a copy of the note sent by Burgoyne to General\r\nGates:--'Sir,--Lady Harriet Ackland, a lady of the first distinction of\r\nfamily, rank, and personal virtues, is under such concern on account of\r\nMajor Ackland, her husband, wounded and a prisoner in your hands, that\r\nI cannot refuse her request to commit her to your protection. Whatever\r\ngeneral impropriety there may be in persons of my situation and yours to\r\nsolicit favours, I cannot see the uncommon perseverance in every female\r\ngrace, and the exaltation of character of this lady, and her very hard\r\nfortune, without testifying that your attentions to her will lay me\r\nunder obligations. I am, sir, your obedient servant, J. Burgoyne.' She\r\nset out in an open boat upon the Hudson, accompanied by Mr. Brudenell,\r\nthe chaplain, Sarah Pollard, her waiting maid, and her husband's valet,\r\nwho had been severely wounded while searching for his master upon the\r\nbattle-field. It was about sunset when they started, and a violent\r\nstorm of rain and wind, which had been increasing since the morning,\r\nrendered the voyage tedious and perilous in the extreme. It was long\r\nafter dark when they reached the American out-posts; the sentinel heard\r\ntheir oars, and hailed them, Lady Harriet returned the answer herself.\r\nThe clear, silvery tones of a woman's voice amid the darkness, filled\r\nthe soldier on duty with superstitious fear, and he called a comrade\r\nto accompany him to the river bank. The errand of the voyagers was made\r\nknown, but the faithful guard, apprehensive of treachery, would not\r\nallow them to laud until they sent for Major Dearborn. They were invited\r\nby that officer to his quarters, where every attention was paid to them,\r\nand Lady Harriet was comforted by the joyful tidings that her husband\r\nwas safe. In the morning she experienced parental tenderness from\r\nGeneral Gates who sent her to her husband, at Poor's quarters, under a\r\nsuitable escort. There she remained until he was removed to Albany.\"\r\n\r\nBurgoyne now took up his last position on the heights near Saratoga; and\r\nhemmed in by the enemy, who refused any encounter, and baffled in all\r\nhis attempts at finding a path of escape, he there lingered until famine\r\ncompelled him to capitulate. The fortitude of the British army during\r\nthis melancholy period has been justly eulogised by many native\r\nhistorians, but I prefer quoting the testimony of a foreign writer, as\r\nfree from all possibility of partiality. Botta says: [Botta, book viii.]\r\n\r\n\"It exceeds the power of words to describe the pitiable condition to\r\nwhich the British army was now reduced. The troops were worn down by a\r\nseries of toil, privation, sickness, and desperate fighting. They were\r\nabandoned by the Indians and Canadians; and the effective force of the\r\nwhole army was now diminished by repeated and heavy losses, which had\r\nprincipally fallen on the best soldiers and the most distinguished\r\nofficers, from ten thousand combatants to less than one-half that\r\nnumber. Of this remnant little more than three thousand were English.\r\n\r\n\"In these circumstances, and thus weakened, they were invested by an\r\narmy of four times their own number, whose position extended three parts\r\nof a circle round them; who refused to fight them, as knowing their\r\nweakness, and who, from the nature of the ground, could not be attacked\r\nin any part. In this helpless condition, obliged to be constantly under\r\narms, while the enemy's cannon played on every part of their camp, and\r\neven the American rifle-balls whistled in many parts of the lines, the\r\ntroops of Burgoyne retained their customary firmness, and, while sinking\r\nunder a hard necessity, they showed themselves worthy of a better fate.\r\nThey could not be reproached with an action or a word, which betrayed a\r\nwant of temper or of fortitude.\"\r\n\r\nAt length the 13th of October arrived, and as no prospect of assistance\r\nappeared, and the provisions were nearly exhausted, Burgoyne, by the\r\nunanimous advice of a council of war, sent a messenger to the American\r\ncamp to treat of a convention.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gates in the first instance demanded that the royal army should\r\nsurrender prisoners of war. He also proposed that the British should\r\nground their arms. Burgoyne replied, \"This article is inadmissible in\r\nevery extremity; sooner than this army will consent to ground their arms\r\nin their encampment, they will rush on the enemy, determined to take no\r\nquarter.\" After various messages, a convention for the surrender of the\r\narmy was settled, which provided that \"The troops under General Burgoyne\r\nwere to march out of their camp with the honours of war, and the\r\nartillery of the intrenchments, to the verge of the river, where the\r\narms and artillery were to be left. The arms to be piled by word of\r\ncommand from their own officers. A free passage was to be granted to the\r\narmy under Lieutenant-General Burgoyne to Great Britain, upon condition\r\nof not serving again in North America during the present contest.\"\r\n\r\nThe articles of capitulation were settled on the 15th of October: and\r\non that very evening a messenger arrived from Clinton with an account\r\nof his successes, and with the tidings that part of his force had\r\npenetrated as far as Esopus, within fifty miles of Burgoyne's camp. But\r\nit was too late. The public faith was pledged; and the army was, indeed,\r\ntoo debilitated by fatigue and hunger to resist an attack if made; and\r\nGates certainly would have made it, if the convention had been broken\r\noff. Accordingly, on the 17th, the convention of Saratoga was carried\r\ninto effect. By this convention 5,790 men surrendered themselves as\r\nprisoners. The sick and wounded left in the camp when the British\r\nretreated to Saratoga, together with the numbers of the British, German,\r\nand Canadian troops, who were killed, wounded, or taken, and who had\r\ndeserted in the preceding part of the expedition, were reckoned to be\r\n4,689.\r\n\r\nThe British sick and wounded who had fallen into the hands of the\r\nAmericans after the battle of the 7th, were treated with exemplary\r\nhumanity; and when the convention was executed, General Gates showed a\r\nnoble delicacy of feeling which deserves the highest degree of honour.\r\nEvery circumstance was avoided which could give the appearance of\r\ntriumph. The American troops remained within their lines until the\r\nBritish had piled their arms; and when this was done, the vanquished\r\nofficers and soldiers were received with friendly kindness by their\r\nvictors, and their immediate wants were promptly and liberally supplied.\r\nDiscussions and disputes afterwards arose as to some of the terms of the\r\nconvention; and the American Congress refused for a long time to carry\r\ninto effect the article which provided for the return of Burgoyne's men\r\nto Europe; but no blame was imputable to General Gates or his army, who\r\nshowed themselves to be generous as they had proved themselves to be\r\nbrave.\r\n\r\nGates after the victory, immediately despatched Colonel Wilkinson to\r\ncarry the happy tidings to Congress. On being introduced into the hall,\r\nhe said, \"The whole British army has laid down its arms at Saratoga;\r\nour own, full of vigour and courage, expect your order. It is for\r\nyour wisdom to decide where the country may still have need for their\r\nservice.\" Honours and rewards were liberally voted by the Congress to\r\ntheir conquering general and his men; \"and it would be difficult\" (says\r\nthe Italian historian) \"to describe the transports of joy which the\r\nnews of this event excited among the Americans. They began to flatter\r\nthemselves with a still more happy future. No one any longer felt any\r\ndoubt about their achieving their independence. All hoped, and with\r\ngood reason, that a success of this importance would at length determine\r\nFrance, and the other European powers that waited for her example, to\r\ndeclare themselves in favour of America. THERE COULD NO LONGER BE ANY\r\nQUESTION RESPECTING THE FUTURE; SINCE THERE WAS NO LONGER THE RISK OF\r\nESPOUSING THE CAUSE OF A PEOPLE TOO FEEBLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth of this was soon displayed in the conduct of France. When\r\nthe news arrived at Paris of the capture of Ticonderoga, and of the\r\nvictorious march of Burgoyne towards Albany, events which seemed\r\ndecisive in favour of the English, instructions had been immediately\r\ndespatched to Nantz, and the other ports of the kingdom, that no\r\nAmerican privateers should be suffered to enter them, except from\r\nindispensable necessity, as to repair their vessels, to obtain\r\nprovisions, or to escape the perils of the sea. The American\r\ncommissioners at Paris, in their disgust and despair, had almost\r\nbroken off all negotiations with the French government; and they even\r\nendeavoured to open communications with the British ministry. But the\r\nBritish government, elated with the first successes of Burgoyne, refused\r\nto listen to any overtures for accommodation. But when the news of\r\nSaratoga reached Paris, the whole scene was changed. Franklin and his\r\nbrother commissioners found all their difficulties with the French\r\ngovernment vanish. The time seemed to have arrived for the House of\r\nBourbon to take a full revenge for all its humiliations and losses in\r\nprevious wars. In December a treaty was arranged, and formally signed\r\nin the February following, by which France acknowledged the INDEPENDENT\r\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA. This was, of course, tantamount to a\r\ndeclaration of war with England. Spain soon followed France; and before\r\nlong Holland took the same course. Largely aided by French fleets and\r\ntroops, the Americans vigorously maintained the war against the armies\r\nwhich England, in spite of her European foes, continued to send across\r\nthe Atlantic. But the struggle was too unequal to be maintained by this\r\ncountry for many years: and when the treaties of 1783 restored peace\r\nto the world, the independence of the United States was reluctantly\r\nrecognized by their ancient parent and recent enemy, England.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF EVENTS BETWEEN THE DEFEAT OF BURGOYNE AT SARATOGA, 1777, AND\r\nTHE BATTLE OF VALMY, 1792.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1781.

Od. i 35.\r\n\r\n     \"A little fire is quickly trodden out,\r\n     Which, being suffered, rivers cannot quench.\"\r\n                             SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few miles distant from the little town of St. Menehould, in the\r\nnorth-east of France, are the village and hill of Valmy; and near the\r\ncrest of that hill, a simple monument points out the burial-place of\r\nthe heart of a general of the French republic, and a marshal of the\r\nFrench empire.\r\n\r\nThe elder Kellerman (father of the distinguished officer of that name,\r\nwhose cavalry-charge decided the battle of Marengo) held high commands\r\nin the French armies throughout the wars of the Convention, the\r\nDirectory, the Consulate, and the Empire. He survived those wars, and\r\nthe empire itself, dying in extreme old age in 1820. The last wish of\r\nthe veteran on his death bed was that his heart should be deposited in\r\nthe battle-field of Valmy, there to repose among the remains of his old\r\ncompanions in arms, who had fallen at his side on that spot twenty-eight\r\nyears before, on the memorable day when they won the primal victory\r\nof revolutionary France, and prevented the armies of Brunswick and\r\nthe emigrant bands of Conde from marching on defenceless Paris, and\r\ndestroying the immature democracy in its cradle.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Valmy (for Kellerman, when made one of Napoleon's\r\nmilitary peers in 1802, took his title from this same battlefield) had\r\nparticipated, during his long and active career, in the gaining of\r\nmany a victory far more immediately dazzling than the the one, the\r\nremembrance of which he thus cherished. He had been present at many a\r\nscene of carnage, where blood flowed in deluges, compared with which the\r\nlibations of slaughter poured out at Valmy would have seemed scant and\r\ninsignificant. But he rightly estimated the paramount importance of the\r\nbattle with which he thus wished his appellation while living, and his\r\nmemory after his death, to be identified. The successful resistance,\r\nwhich the new Carmagnole levies, and the disorganized relics of the old\r\nmonarchy's army, then opposed to the combined hosts and chosen leaders\r\nof Prussia, Austria, and the French refugee noblesse, determined at\r\nonce and for ever the belligerent character of the revolution. The raw\r\nartisans and tradesmen, the clumsy burghers, the base mechanics and low\r\npeasant churls, as it had been the fashion to term the middle and\r\nlower classes in France, found that they could face cannon-balls, pull\r\ntriggers, and cross bayonets, without having been drilled into military\r\nmachines, and without being officered by scions of noble houses. They\r\nawoke to the consciousness of their own instinctive soldiership. They\r\nat once acquired confidence in themselves and in each other; and that\r\nconfidence soon grew into a spirit of unbounded audacity and ambition.\r\n\"From the cannonade of Valmy may be dated the commencement of that\r\ncareer of victory which carried their armies to Vienna and the Kremlin.\"\r\n[Alison.]\r\n\r\nOne of the gravest reflections that arises from the contemplation of the\r\ncivil restlessness and military enthusiasm which the close of the last\r\ncentury saw nationalised in France, is the consideration that these\r\ndisturbing influences have become perpetual. No settled system of\r\ngovernment, that shall endure from generation to generation, that shall\r\nbe proof against corruption and popular violence, seems capable of\r\ntaking root among the French. And every revolutionary movement in Paris\r\nthrills throughout the rest of the world. Even the successes which the\r\npowers allied against France gained in 1814 and 1815, important as they\r\nwere, could not annul the effects of the preceding twenty-three years of\r\ngeneral convulsion and war.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, the dynasty which foreign bayonets had imposed on France was\r\nshaken off; and men trembled at the expected outbreak of French anarchy\r\nand the dreaded inroads of French ambition. They \"looked forward with\r\nharassing anxiety to a period of destruction similar to that which the\r\nRoman world experienced about the middle of the third century of our\r\nera.\" [See Niebuhr's Preface to the second volume of the \"History of\r\nRome,\" written in October 1830.] Louis Philippe cajoled revolution, and\r\nthen strove with seeming success to stifle it. But in spite of Fieschi\r\nlaws, in spite of the dazzle of Algerian razzias and Pyrenees-effacing\r\nmarriages, in spite of hundreds of armed forts, and hundreds of\r\nthousands of coercing troops, Revolution lived, and struggled to get\r\nfree. The old Titan spirit heaved restlessly beneath \"the monarchy based\r\non republican institutions.\" At last, four years ago, the whole fabric\r\nof kingcraft was at once rent and scattered to the winds, by the\r\nuprising of the Parisian democracy; and insurrections, barricades and\r\ndethronements, the downfall of coronets and crowns, the armed collisions\r\nof parties, systems, and populations, became the commonplaces of recent\r\nEuropean history.\r\n\r\nFrance now calls herself a republic. She first assumed that title on the\r\n20th of September, 1792, on the very day on which the battle of Valmy\r\nwas fought and won. To that battle the democratic spirit which in\r\n1848, as well as in 1792, proclaimed the Republic in Paris, owed its\r\npreservation, and it is thence that the imperishable activity of its\r\nprinciples may be dated.\r\n\r\nFar different seemed the prospects of democracy in Europe on the eve of\r\nthat battle; and far different would have been the present position and\r\ninfluence of the French nation, if Brunswick's columns had charged with\r\nmore boldness, or the lines of Dumouriez resisted with less firmness.\r\nWhen France, in 1792, declared war with the great powers of Europe, she\r\nwas far from possessing that splendid military organization which the\r\nexperience of a few revolutionary campaigns taught her to assume, and\r\nwhich she has never abandoned. The army of the old monarchy had, during\r\nthe latter part of the reign of Louis XV. sunk into gradual decay,\r\nboth in numerical force, and in efficiency of equipment and spirit. The\r\nlaurels gained by the auxiliary regiments which Louis XVI. sent to the\r\nAmerican war, did but little to restore the general tone of the army.\r\nThe insubordination and licence, which the revolt of the French guards,\r\nand the participation of other troops in many of the first excesses\r\nof the Revolution introduced among the soldiery, were soon rapidly\r\ndisseminated through all the ranks. Under the Legislative Assembly\r\nevery complaint of the soldier against his officer, however frivolous\r\nor ill-founded, was listened to with eagerness, and investigated with\r\npartiality, on the principles of liberty and equality. Discipline\r\naccordingly became more and more relaxed; and the dissolution of several\r\nof the old corps, under the pretext of their being tainted with an\r\naristocratic feeling, aggravated the confusion and inefficiency of the\r\nwar department. Many of the most effective regiments during the last\r\nperiod of the monarchy had consisted of foreigners. These had either\r\nbeen slaughtered in defence of the throne against insurrections, like\r\nthe Swiss; or had been disbanded, and had crossed the frontier to\r\nrecruit the forces which were assembling for the invasion of France.\r\nAbove all, the emigration of the noblesse had stripped the French army\r\nof nearly all its officers of high rank, and of the greatest portion\r\nof its subalterns. More than twelve thousand of the high-born youth\r\nof France, who had been trained to regard military command as their\r\nexclusive patrimony, and to whom the nation had been accustomed to look\r\nup as its natural guides and champions in the storm of war; were now\r\nmarshalled beneath the banner of Conde and the other emigrant princes,\r\nfor the overthrow of the French armies, and the reduction of the French\r\ncapital. Their successors in the French regiments and brigades had\r\nas yet acquired neither skill nor experience: they possessed neither\r\nself-reliance nor the respect of the men who were under them.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the wrecks of the old army; but the bulk of the\r\nforces with which France began the war, consisted of raw insurrectionary\r\nlevies, which were even less to be depended on. The Carmagnoles, as the\r\nrevolutionary volunteers were called, flocked, indeed, readily to the\r\nfrontier from every department when the war was proclaimed, and the\r\nfierce leaders of the Jacobins shouted that the country was in danger.\r\nThey were full of zeal and courage, \"heated and excited by the scenes of\r\nthe Revolution, and inflamed by the florid eloquence, the songs, dances,\r\nand signal-words with which it had been celebrated.\" [Scott, Life of\r\nNapoleon, vol. i c. viii.] But they were utterly undisciplined, and\r\nturbulently impatient of superior authority, or systematical control.\r\nMany ruffians, also, who were sullied with participation in the most\r\nsanguinary horrors of Paris, joined the camps, and were pre-eminent\r\nalike for misconduct before the enemy and for savage insubordination\r\nagainst their own officers. On one occasion during the campaign of\r\nValmy, eight battalions of federates, intoxicated with massacre and\r\nsedition, joined the forces under Dumouriez, and soon threatened to\r\nuproot all discipline, saying openly that the ancient officers were\r\ntraitors, and that it was necessary to purge the army, as they had\r\nParis, of its aristocrats. Dumouriez posted these battalions apart from\r\nthe others, placed a strong force of cavalry behind them, and two pieces\r\nof cannon on their flank. Then, affecting to review them, he halted at\r\nthe head of the line, surrounded by all his staff, and an escort of a\r\nhundred hussars. \"Fellows,\" said he, \"for I will not call you either\r\ncitizens or soldiers, you see before you this artillery, behind you\r\nthis cavalry; you are stained with crimes, and I do not tolerate here\r\nassassins or executioners. I know that there are scoundrels amongst you\r\ncharged to excite you to crime. Drive them from amongst you, or denounce\r\nthem to me, for I shall hold you responsible for their conduct.\"\r\n[Lamartine.]\r\n\r\nOne of our recent historians of the Revolution, who narrates this\r\nincident, [Carlyle.] thus apostrophises the French general:--\r\n\r\n\"Patience, O Dumouriez! This uncertain heap of shriekers, mutineers,\r\nwere they once drilled and inured, will become a phalanxed mass of\r\nfighters; and wheel and whirl to order swiftly, like the wind or the\r\nwhirlwind; tanned mustachio-figures; often barefoot, even barebacked,\r\nwith sinews of iron; who require only bread and gunpowder; very sons of\r\nfire; the adroitest, hastiest, hottest, ever seen perhaps since Attila's\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nSuch phalanxed masses of fighters did the Carmagnoles ultimately become;\r\nbut France ran a fearful risk in being obliged to rely on them when the\r\nprocess of their transmutation had barely commenced.\r\n\r\nThe first events, indeed, of the war were disastrous and disgraceful to\r\nFrance, even beyond what might have been expected from the chaotic state\r\nin which it found her armies as well as her government. In the hopes of\r\nprofiting by the unprepared state of Austria, then the mistress of the\r\nNetherlands, the French opened the campaign of 1792 by an invasion of\r\nFlanders, with forces whose muster-rolls showed a numerical overwhelming\r\nsuperiority to the enemy, and seemed to promise a speedy conquest of\r\nthat old battle-field of Europe. But the first flash of an Austrian\r\nsabre, or the first sound of Austrian gun, was enough to discomfit the\r\nFrench. Their first corps, four thousand strong, that advanced from\r\nLille across the frontier, came suddenly upon a far inferior detachment\r\nof the Austrian garrison of Tournay. Not a shot was fired, not a bayonet\r\nlevelled. With one simultaneous cry of panic the French broke and\r\nran headlong back to Lille, where they completed the specimen of\r\ninsubordination which they had given in the field, by murdering their\r\ngeneral and several of their chief officers. On the same day, another\r\ndivision under Biron, mustering ten thousand sabres and bayonets, saw\r\na few Austrian skirmishers reconnoitering their position. The French\r\nadvanced posts had scarcely given and received a volley, and only a few\r\nballs from the enemy's field-pieces had fallen among the lines, when two\r\nregiments of French dragoons raised the cry, \"We are betrayed,\" galloped\r\noff, and were followed in disgraceful rout by the rest of the whole\r\narmy. Similar panics, or repulses almost equally discreditable, occurred\r\nwhenever Rochambeau, or Luckner, or La Fayette, the earliest French\r\ngenerals in the war, brought their troops into the presence of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the allied sovereigns had gradually collected on the Rhine\r\na veteran and finely-disciplined army for the invasion of France, which\r\nfor numbers, equipment, and martial renown, both of generals and men,\r\nwas equal to any that Germany had ever sent forth to conquer. Their\r\ndesign was to strike boldly and decisively at the heart of France, and\r\npenetrating the country through the Ardennes, to proceed by Chalons upon\r\nParis. The obstacles that lay in their way seemed insignificant. The\r\ndisorder and imbecility of the French armies had been even augmented by\r\nthe forced flight of La Fayette, and a sudden change of generals. The\r\nonly troops posted on or near the track by which the allies were about\r\nto advance, were the twenty-three thousand men at Sedan, whom La Fayette\r\nhad commanded, and a corps of twenty thousand near Metz, the command of\r\nwhich had just been transferred from Luckner to Kellerman. There were\r\nonly three fortresses which it was necessary for the allies to capture\r\nor mask--Sedan, Longwy, and Verdun. The defences and stores of these\r\nthree were known to be wretchedly dismantled and insufficient; and when\r\nonce these feeble barriers were overcome, and Chalons reached, a fertile\r\nand unprotected country seemed to invite the invaders to that \"military\r\npromenade to Paris,\" which they gaily talked of accomplishing.\r\n\r\nAt the end of July the allied army, having completed all preparations\r\nfor the campaign, broke up from its cantonments, and marching from\r\nLuxembourg upon Longwy, crossed the French frontier. Eighty thousand\r\nPrussians, trained in the school, and many of them under the eye of\r\nthe Great Frederick, heirs of the glories of the Seven Years' War, and\r\nuniversally esteemed the best troops in Europe, marched in one column\r\nagainst the central point of attack. Forty-five thousand Austrians, the\r\ngreater part of whom were picked troops, and had served in the recent\r\nTurkish war, supplied two formidable corps that supported the flanks of\r\nthe Prussians. There was also a powerful body of Hessians, and leagued\r\nwith the Germans against the Parisian democracy, came fifteen thousand\r\nof the noblest and bravest amongst the sons of France. In these corps\r\nof emigrants, many of the highest born of the French nobility, scions\r\nof houses whose chivalric trophies had for centuries filled Europe with\r\nrenown, served as rank and file. They looked on the road to Paris as the\r\npath which they were to carve out by their swords to victory, to honour,\r\nto the rescue of their king, to reunion with their families, to the\r\nrecovery of their patrimony, and to the restoration of their order. [See\r\nScott, Life of Napoleon, vol. i. c. xi.]\r\n\r\nOver this imposing army the allied sovereigns placed as generalissimo\r\nthe Duke of Brunswick, one of the minor reigning princes of Germany, a\r\nstatesman of no mean capacity, and who had acquired in the Seven Years'\r\nWar, a military reputation second only to that of the Great Frederick\r\nhimself. He had been deputed a few years before to quell the popular\r\nmovements which then took place in Holland; and he had put down\r\nthe attempted revolution in that country with a promptitude and\r\ncompleteness, which appeared to augur equal success to the army that now\r\nmarched under his orders on a similar mission into France.\r\n\r\nMoving majestically forward, with leisurely deliberation, that seemed\r\nto show the consciousness of superior strength, and a steady purpose of\r\ndoing their work thoroughly, the Allies appeared before Longwy on the\r\n20th of August, and the dispirited and dependent garrison opened the\r\ngates of that fortress to them after the first shower of bombs. On\r\nthe 2d of September the still more important stronghold of Verdun\r\ncapitulated after scarcely the shadow of resistance.\r\n\r\nBrunswick's superior force was now interposed between Kellerman's troops\r\non the left, and the other French army near Sedan, which La Fayette's\r\nflight had, for the time, left destitute of a commander. It was in the\r\npower of the German general, by striking with an overwhelming mass to\r\nthe right and left, to crush in succession each of these weak armies,\r\nand the allies might then have marched irresistible and unresisted upon\r\nParis. But at this crisis Dumouriez, the new commander-in-chief of\r\nthe French, arrived at the camp near Sedan, and commenced a series of\r\nmovements, by which he reunited the dispersed and disorganized forces\r\nof his country, checked the Prussian columns at the very moment when the\r\nlast obstacles of their triumph seemed to have given way, and finally\r\nrolled back the tide of invasion far across the enemy's frontier.\r\n\r\nThe French fortresses had fallen; but nature herself still offered\r\nto brave and vigorous defenders of the land, the means of opposing a\r\nbarrier to the progress of the Allies. A ridge of broken ground, called\r\nthe Argonne, extends from the vicinity of Sedan towards the south-west\r\nfor about fifteen or sixteen leagues, The country of L'Argonne has now\r\nbeen cleared and drained; but in 1792 it was thickly wooded, and the\r\nlower portions of its unequal surface were filled with rivulets and\r\nmarshes. It thus presented a natural barrier of from four to five\r\nleagues broad, which was absolutely impenetrable to an army, except by a\r\nfew defiles, such as an inferior force might easily fortify and defend.\r\nDumouriez succeeded in marching his army down from Sedan behind the\r\nArgonne, and in occupying its passes, while the Prussians still lingered\r\non the north-eastern side of the forest line. Ordering Kellerman to\r\nwheel round from Metz to St. Menehould, and the reinforcements from the\r\ninterior and extreme north also to concentrate at that spot, Dumouriez\r\ntrusted to assemble a powerful force in the rear of the south-west\r\nextremity of the Argonne, while, with the twenty-five thousand men under\r\nhis immediate command, he held the enemy at bay before the passes, or\r\nforced him to a long circumvolution round one extremity of the forest\r\nridge, during which, favourable opportunities of assailing his flank\r\nwere almost certain to occur. Dumouriez fortified the principal defiles,\r\nand boasted of the Thermopylae which he had found for the invaders; but\r\nthe simile was nearly rendered fatally complete for the defending force.\r\nA pass, which was thought of inferior importance, had been but slightly\r\nmanned, and an Austrian corps under Clairfayt, forced it after some\r\nsharp fighting. Dumouriez with great difficulty saved himself from being\r\nenveloped and destroyed by the hostile columns that now pushed through\r\nthe forest. But instead of despairing at the failure of his plans,\r\nand falling back into the interior, to be completely severed from\r\nKellerman's army, to be hunted as a fugitive under the walls of Paris\r\nby the victorious Germans, and to lose all chance of ever rallying his\r\ndispirited troops, he resolved to cling to the difficult country in\r\nwhich the armies still were grouped, to force a junction with Kellerman,\r\nand so to place himself at the head of a force, which the invaders would\r\nnot dare to disregard, and by which he might drag them back from the\r\nadvance on Paris, which he had not been able to bar. Accordingly, by a\r\nrapid movement to the south, during which, in his own words, \"France was\r\nwithin a hair's-breadth of destruction,\" and after, with difficulty,\r\nchecking several panics of his troops in which they ran by thousands at\r\nthe sight of a few Prussian hussars, Dumouriez succeeded in establishing\r\nhis head-quarters in a strong position at St. Menehould, protected by\r\nthe marshes and shallows of the river Aisne and Aube, beyond which, to\r\nthe north-west, rose a firm and elevated plateau, called Dampierre's\r\nCamp, admirably situated for commanding the road by Chalons to Paris,\r\nand where he intended to post Kellerman's army so soon as it came\r\nup. [Some late writers represent that Brunswick did not wish to check\r\nDumouriez. There is no sufficient authority for this insinuation, which\r\nseems to have been first prompted by a desire to soothe the wounded\r\nmilitary pride of the Prussians.]\r\n\r\nThe news of the retreat of Dumouriez from the Argonne passes, and of the\r\npanic flight of some divisions of his troops, spread rapidly throughout\r\nthe country; and Kellerman, who believed that his comrade's army had\r\nbeen annihilated, and feared to fall among the victorious masses of the\r\nPrussians, had halted on his march from Metz when almost close to\r\nSt. Menehould. He had actually commenced a retrograde movement, when\r\ncouriers from his commander-in-chief checked him from that fatal course;\r\nand then continuing to wheel round the rear and left flank of the troops\r\nat St. Menehould, Kellerman, with twenty thousand of the army of Metz,\r\nand some thousands of volunteers who had joined him in the march,\r\nmade his appearance to the west of Dumouriez, on the very evening\r\nwhen Westerman and Thouvenot, two of the staff-officers of Dumouriez,\r\ngalloped in with the tidings that Brunswick's army had come through\r\nthe upper passes of the Argonne in full force, and was deploying on the\r\nheights of La Lune, a chain of eminences that stretch obliquely from\r\nsouth-west to north-east opposite the high ground which Dumouriez held,\r\nand also opposite, but at a shorter distance from, the position which\r\nKellerman was designed to occupy.\r\n\r\nThe Allies were now, in fact, nearer to Paris than were the French\r\ntroops themselves; but, as Dumouriez had foreseen, Brunswick deemed it\r\nunsafe to march upon the capital with so large a hostile force left in\r\nhis rear between his advancing columns and his base of operations. The\r\nyoung King of Prussia, who was in the allied camp, and the emigrant\r\nprinces, eagerly advocated an instant attack upon the nearest French\r\ngeneral. Kellerman had laid himself unnecessarily open, by advancing\r\nbeyond Dampierre's Camp, which Dumouriez had designed for him, and\r\nmoving forward across the Aube to the plateau of Valmy, a post inferior\r\nin strength and space to that which he had left, and which brought him\r\nclose upon the Prussian lines, leaving him separated by a dangerous\r\ninterval from the troops under Dumouriez himself. It seemed easy for the\r\nPrussian army to overwhelm him while thus isolated, and then they might\r\nsurround and crush Dumouriez at their leisure.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the right wing of the allied army moved forward, in the\r\ngrey of the morning of the 20th of September, to gain Kellerman's left\r\nflank and rear, and cut him off from retreat upon Chalons, while\r\nthe rest of the army, moving from the heights of La Lune, which here\r\nconverge semi-circularly round the plateau of Valmy, were to assail\r\nhis position in front, and interpose between him and Dumouriez. An\r\nunexpected collision between some of the advanced cavalry on each side\r\nin the low ground, warned Kellerman of the enemy's approach. Dumouriez\r\nhad not been unobservant of the danger of his comrade, thus isolated and\r\ninvolved; and he had ordered up troops to support Kellerman on either\r\nflank in the event of his being attacked. These troops, however, moved\r\nforward slowly; and Kellerman's army, ranged on the plateau of Valmy,\r\n\"projected like a cape into the midst of the lines of the Prussian\r\nbayonets.\" [See Lamartine, Hist. Girond. livre xvii. I have drawn much\r\nof the ensuing description from him.] A thick autumnal mist floated in\r\nwaves of vapour over the plains and ravines that lay between the two\r\narmies, leaving only the crests and peaks of the hills glittering in the\r\nearly light. About ten o'clock the fog began to clear off, and then\r\nthe French from their promontory saw emerging from the white wreaths\r\nof mist, and glittering in the sunshine, the countless Prussian cavalry\r\nwhich were to envelops them as in a net if once driven from their\r\nposition, the solid columns of the infantry that moved forward as if\r\nanimated by a single will, the bristling batteries of the artillery,\r\nand the glancing clouds of the Austrian light troops, fresh from their\r\ncontests with the Spahis of the east.\r\n\r\nThe best and bravest of the French must have beheld this spectacle with\r\nsecret apprehension and awe. However bold and resolute a man may be in\r\nthe discharge of duty, it is an anxious and fearful thing to be called\r\non to encounter danger among comrades of whose steadiness you can feel\r\nno certainty. Each soldier of Kellerman's army must have remembered the\r\nseries of panic routs which had hitherto invariably taken place on the\r\nFrench side during the war; and must have cast restless glances to\r\nthe right and left, to see if any symptoms of wavering began to show\r\nthemselves, and to calculate how long it was likely to be before a\r\ngeneral rush of his comrades to the rear would either harry him off with\r\ninvoluntary disgrace, or leave him alone and helpless, to be cut down by\r\nassailing multitudes.\r\n\r\nOn that very morning, and at the self-same hour, in which the allied\r\nforces and the emigrants began to descend from La Lune to the attack of\r\nValmy, and while the cannonade was opening between the Prussian and the\r\nRevolutionary batteries, the debate in the National Convention at Paris\r\ncommenced on the proposal to proclaim France a Republic.\r\n\r\nThe old monarchy had little chance of support in the hall of the\r\nConvention; but if its more effective advocates at Valmy had triumphed,\r\nthere were yet the elements existing in France for a permanent revival\r\nof the better part of the ancient institutions, and for substituting\r\nReform for Revolution. Only a few weeks before, numerously signed\r\naddresses from the middle classes in Paris, Rouen, and other large\r\ncities, had been presented to the king, expressive of their horror of\r\nthe anarchists, and their readiness to uphold the rights of the crown,\r\ntogether with the liberties of the subject. And an armed resistance\r\nto the authority of the Convention, and in favour of the king, was in\r\nreality at this time being actively organized in La Vendee and Brittany,\r\nthe importance of which may be estimated from the formidable opposition\r\nwhich the Royalists of these provinces made to the Republican party, at\r\na later period, and under much more disadvantageous circumstances. It is\r\na fact peculiarly illustrative of the importance of the battle of Valmy,\r\nthat \"during the summer of 1792, the gentlemen of Brittany entered into\r\nan extensive association for the purpose of rescuing the country from\r\nthe oppressive yoke which had been imposed by the Parisian demagogues.\r\nAt the head of the whole was the Marquis de la Rouarie, one of those\r\nremarkable men who rise into pre-eminence during the stormy days of\r\na revolution, from conscious ability to direct its current. Ardent,\r\nimpetuous, and enthusiastic, he was first distinguished in the American\r\nwar, when the intrepidity of his conduct attracted the admiration of\r\nthe Republican troops, and the same qualities rendered him at first an\r\nardent supporter of the Revolution in France; but when the atrocities of\r\nthe people began, he espoused with equal warmth the opposite side, and\r\nused the utmost efforts to rouse the noblesse of Brittany against the\r\nplebeian yoke which had been imposed upon them by the National Assembly.\r\nHe submitted his plan to the Count d'Artois, and had organized one so\r\nextensive, as would have proved extremely formidable to the Convention,\r\nif the retreat of the Duke of Brunswick, in September 1792, had not\r\ndamped the ardour of the whole of the west of France, then ready to\r\nbreak out into insurrection.\" [Alison, vol. iii. p. 323.]\r\n\r\nAnd it was not only among the zealots of the old monarchy that the cause\r\nof the king would then have found friends. The ineffable atrocities of\r\nthe September massacres had just occurred, and the reaction produced\r\nby them among thousands who had previously been active on the\r\nultra-democratic side, was fresh and powerful. The nobility had not yet\r\nbeen made utter aliens in the eyes of the nation by long expatriation\r\nand civil war. There was not yet a generation of youth educated in\r\nrevolutionary principles, and knowing no worship-save that of military\r\nglory, Louis XVI. was just and humane, and deeply sensible of the\r\nnecessity of a gradual extension of political rights among all classes\r\nof his subjects. The Bourbon throne, if rescued in 1792, would have had\r\nchances of stability, such as did not exist for it in 1814, and seem\r\nnever likely to be found again in France.\r\n\r\nServing under Kellerman on that day was one who experienced, perhaps\r\nthe most deeply of all men, the changes for good and for evil which the\r\nFrench Revolution has produced. He who, in his second exile, bore the\r\nname of the Count de Neuilly in this country, and who lately was Louis\r\nPhilippe, King of the French, figured in the French lines at Valmy, as\r\na young and gallant officer, cool and sagacious beyond his years, and\r\ntrusted accordingly by Kellerman and Dumouriez with an important station\r\nin the national army. The Duc de Chartres (the title he then bore)\r\ncommanded the French right, General Valence was on the left, and\r\nKellerman himself took his post in the centre, which was the strength\r\nand key of his position.\r\n\r\nBesides these celebrated men, who were in the French army, and besides\r\nthe King of Prussia, the Duke of Brunswick, and other men of rank and\r\npower, who were in the lines of the Allies, there was an individual\r\npresent at the battle of Valmy, of little political note, but who has\r\nexercised, and exercises, a greater influence over the human mind, and\r\nwhose fame is more widely spread, than that of either duke, or general,\r\nor king. This was the German poet, Goethe, who had, out of curiosity,\r\naccompanied the allied army on its march into France as a mere\r\nspectator. He has given us a curious record of the sensations which\r\nhe experienced during the cannonade. It must be remembered that\r\nmany thousands in, the French ranks then, like Goethe, felt the\r\n\"cannon-fever\" for the first time. The German poet says, [Goethe's\r\nCampaign in France in 1792. Farie's translation, p.77.]--\r\n\r\n\"I had heard so much of the cannon-fever, that I wanted to know what\r\nkind of thing it was. ENNUI, and a spirit which every kind of danger\r\nexcites to daring, nay even to rashness, induced me to ride up quite\r\ncoolly to the outwork of La Lune. This was again occupied by our people;\r\nbut it presented the wildest aspect. The roofs were shot to pieces;\r\nthe corn-shocks scattered about, the bodies of men mortally wounded\r\nstretched upon them here and there; and occasionally a spent cannon-ball\r\nfell and rattled among the ruins of the the roofs.\r\n\r\n\"Quite alone, and left to myself, I rode away on the heights to the\r\nleft, and could plainly survey the favourable position of the French;\r\nthey were standing in the form of a semicircle in the greatest quiet and\r\nsecurity; Kellerman, then on the left wing, being the easiest to reach.\r\n\r\n\"I fell in with good company on the way, officers of my acquaintance,\r\nbelonging to the general staff and the regiment, greatly surprised to\r\nfind me here. They wanted to take me back again with them; but I spoke\r\nto them of particular objects I had in view, and they left me without\r\nfurther dissuasion, to my well-known singular caprice.\r\n\r\n\"I had now arrived quite in the region where the balls were playing\r\nacross me: the sound of them is curious enough, as if it were composed\r\nof the humming of tops, the gurgling of water, and the whistling of\r\nbirds. They were less dangerous, by reason of the wetness of the ground:\r\nwherever one fell, it stuck fast. And thus my foolish experimental ride\r\nwas secured against the danger at least of the balls rebounding.\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of these circumstances, I was soon able to remark that\r\nsomething unusual was taking place within me. I paid close attention\r\nto it, and still the sensation can be described only by similitude. It\r\nappeared as if you were in some extremely hot place, and, at the same\r\ntime, quite penetrated by the heat of it, so that you feel yourself,\r\nas it were, quite one with the element in which you are. The eyes lose\r\nnothing of their strength or clearness; but it is as if the world had\r\na kind of brown-red tint, which makes the situation, as well as the\r\nsurrounding objects, more impressive. I was unable to perceive any\r\nagitation of the blood; but everything seemed rather to be swallowed up\r\nin the glow of which I speak. From this, then, it is clear in what sense\r\nthis condition can be called a fever. It is remarkable, however, that\r\nthe horrible uneasy feeling arising from it is produced in us solely\r\nthrough the ears; for the cannon-thunder, the howling and crashing of\r\nthe balls through the air, is the real cause of these sensations.\r\n\r\n\"After I had ridden back, and was in perfect security, I remarked\r\nwith surprise that the glow was completely extinguished, and not\r\nthe slightest feverish agitation was left behind. On the whole, this\r\ncondition is one of the least desirable; as, indeed, among my dear and\r\nnoble comrades, I found scarcely one who expressed a really passionate\r\ndesire to try it.\"\r\n\r\nContrary to the expectations of both friends and foes, the French\r\ninfantry held their ground steadily under the fire of the Prussian guns,\r\nwhich thundered on them from La Lune; and their own artillery replied\r\nwith equal spirit and greater effect on the denser masses of the\r\nallied army. Thinking that the Prussians were slackening in their fire,\r\nKellerman formed a column in charging order, and dashed down into the\r\nvalley, in the hopes of capturing some of the nearest guns of the enemy.\r\nA masked battery opened its fire on the French column, and drove it back\r\nin disorder. Kellerman having his horse shot under him, and being with\r\ndifficulty carried off by his men. The Prussian columns now advanced in\r\nturn. The French artillerymen began to waver and desert their posts,\r\nbut were rallied by the efforts and example of their officers; and\r\nKellerman, reorganizing the line of his infantry, took his station in\r\nthe ranks on foot, and called out to his men to let the enemy come close\r\nup, and then to charge them with the bayonet. The troops caught the\r\nenthusiasm of their general, and a cheerful shout of VIVE LA NATION!\r\ntaken by one battalion from another, pealed across the valley to the\r\nassailants. The Prussians flinched from a charge up-hill against a force\r\nthat seemed so resolute and formidable; they halted for a while in the\r\nhollow, and then slowly retreated up their own side of the valley.\r\n\r\nIndignant at being thus repulsed by such a foe, the King of Prussia\r\nformed the flower of his men in person, and, riding along the column,\r\nbitterly reproached them with letting their standard be thus humiliated.\r\nThen he led them on again to the attack marching in the front line,\r\nand seeing his staff mowed down around him by the deadly fire which the\r\nFrench artillery re-opened. But the troops sent by Dumouriez were now\r\nco-operating effectually with Kellerman, and that general's own men,\r\nflushed by success, presented a firmer front than ever. Again the\r\nPrussians retreated, leaving eight hundred dead behind, and at nightfall\r\nthe French remained victors on the heights of Valmy.\r\n\r\nAll hopes of crushing the revolutionary armies, and of the promenade to\r\nParis, had now vanished, though Brunswick lingered long in the Argonne,\r\ntill distress and sickness wasted away his once splendid force,\r\nand finally but a mere wreck of it recrossed the frontier. France,\r\nmeanwhile, felt that she possessed a giant's strength, and like a giant\r\ndid she use it. Before the close of that year, all Belgium obeyed the\r\nNational Convention at Paris, and the kings of Europe, after the lapse\r\nof eighteen centuries, trembled once more before a conquering military\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nGoethe's description of the cannonade has been quoted. His observation\r\nto his comrades in the camp of the Allies, at the end of the battle,\r\ndeserves citation also. It shows that the poet felt (and, probably, he\r\nalone of the thousands there assembled felt) the full importance of that\r\nday. He describes the consternation and the change of demeanour which he\r\nobserved among his Prussian friends that evening, he tells us that \"most\r\nof them were silent; and, in fact, the power of reflection and judgment\r\nwas wanting to all. At last I was called upon to say what I thought of\r\nthe engagement; for I had been in the habit of enlivening and amusing\r\nthe troop with short sayings. This time I said: 'FROM THIS PLACE, AND\r\nFROM THIS DAY FORTH, COMMENCES A NEW ERA IN THE WORLD'S HISTORY, AND YOU\r\nCAN ALL SAY THAT YOU WERE PRESENT AT ITS BIRTH.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OP EVENTS BETWEEN THE BATTLE OF VALMY, 1792, AND THE BATTLE OF\r\nWATERLOO, 1815.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1793.

At no other\r\nperiod of her history can a similarly long cessation from a state of\r\nwarfare be found. It is true that our troops have had battles to fight\r\nduring this interval for the protection and extension of our Indian\r\npossessions and our colonies; but these have been with distant and\r\nunimportant enemies. The danger has never been brought near our own\r\nshores, and no matter of vital importance to our empire has ever been\r\nat stake. We have not had hostilities with either France, America, or\r\nRussia; and when not at war with any of our peers, we feel ourselves\r\nto be substantially at peace. There has, indeed, throughout this long\r\nperiod, been no great war, like those with which the previous history\r\nof modern Europe abounds. There have been formidable collisions between\r\nparticular states; and there have been still more formidable collisions\r\nbetween the armed champions of the conflicting principles of absolutism\r\nand democracy; but there has been no general war, like those of the\r\nFrench Revolution, like the American, or the Seven Years' War, or like\r\nthe War of the Spanish Succession. It would be far too much to augur\r\nfrom this, that no similar wars will again convulse the world; but the\r\nvalue of the period of peace which Europe has gained, is incalculable;\r\neven if we look on it as only a truce, and expect again to see the\r\nnations of the earth recur to what some philosophers have termed man's\r\nnatural state of warfare.\r\n\r\nNo equal number of years can be found, during which science, commerce,\r\nand civilization have advanced so rapidly and so extensively, as has\r\nbeen the case since 1815. When we trace their progress, especially\r\nin this country, it is impossible not to feel that their wondrous\r\ndevelopment has been mainly due to the land having been at peace. [See\r\nthe excellent Introduction to Mr. Charles Knight's \"History of the\r\nThirty Years' Peace.\"] Their good effects cannot be obliterated, even\r\nif a series of wars were to recommence. When we reflect on this, and\r\ncontrast these thirty-seven years with the period that preceded them,\r\na period of violence, of tumult, of unrestingly destructive energy,--a\r\nperiod throughout which the wealth of nations was scattered like sand,\r\nand the blood of nations lavished like water,--it is impossible not to\r\nlook with deep interest on the final crisis of that dark and dreadful\r\nepoch; the crisis out of which our own happier cycle of years has been\r\nevolved. The great battle which ended the twenty-three years' war of\r\nthe first French Revolution, and which quelled the man whose genius and\r\nambition had so long disturbed and desolated the world, deserves to be\r\nregarded by us, not only with peculiar pride, as one of our greatest\r\nnational victories, but with peculiar gratitude for the repose which it\r\nsecured for us, and for the greater part of the human race.\r\n\r\nOne good test for determining the importance of Waterloo, is to\r\nascertain what was felt by wise and prudent statesmen before that\r\nbattle, respecting the return of Napoleon from Elba to the Imperial\r\nthrone of France, and the probable effects of his success. For\r\nthis purpose, I will quote the words, not of any of our vehement\r\nanti-Gallican politicians of the school of Pitt, but of a leader of our\r\nLiberal party, of a man whose reputation as a jurist, a historian and a\r\nfar-sighted and candid statesman, was, and is, deservedly high, not only\r\nin this country, but throughout Europe. Sir James Mackintosh, in the\r\ndebate in the British House of Commons, on the 20th April, 1815, spoke\r\nthus of the return from Elba:--\r\n\r\n\"Was it in the power of language to describe the evil. Wars which had\r\nraged for more than twenty years throughout Europe; which had\r\nspread blood and desolation from Cadiz to Moscow, and from Naples to\r\nCopenhagen; which had wasted the means of human enjoyment, and destroyed\r\nthe instruments of social improvement; which threatened to diffuse among\r\nthe European nations, the dissolute and ferocious habits of a predatory\r\nsoldiery,--at length, by one of those vicissitudes which bid defiance to\r\nthe foresight of man, had been brought to a close, upon the whole, happy\r\nbeyond all reasonable expectation, with no violent shock to national\r\nindependence, with some tolerable compromise between the opinions of\r\nthe age and reverence due to ancient institutions; with no too signal or\r\nmortifying triumph over the legitimate interests or avowable feelings\r\nof any numerous body of men, and, above all, without those retaliations\r\nagainst nations or parties, which beget new convulsions, often as\r\nhorrible as those which they close, and perpetuate revenge and hatred\r\nand bloodshed, from age to age. Europe seemed to breathe after her\r\nsufferings. In the midst of this fair prospect, and of these consolatory\r\nhopes, Napoleon Bonaparte escaped from Elba; three small vessels reached\r\nthe coast of Provence; our hopes are instantly dispelled; the work of\r\nour toil and fortitude is undone; the blood of Europe is spilt in vain--\r\n\r\n\"'Ibi omnis effusus labor!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Congress of Emperors, Kings, Princes, Generals, and Statesmen, who\r\nhad assembled at Vienna to remodel the world after the overthrow of the\r\nmighty conqueror, and who thought that Napoleon had passed away for ever\r\nfrom the great drama of European politics, had not yet completed their\r\ntriumphant festivities, and their diplomatic toils, when Talleyrand,\r\non the 11th of March, 1815, rose up among them, and announced that the\r\nex-emperor had escaped from Elba, and was Emperor of France once more.\r\nIt is recorded by Sir Walter Scott, as a curious physiological fact,\r\nthat the first effect of the news of an event which threatened to\r\nneutralise all their labours, was to excite a loud burst of laughter\r\nfrom nearly every member of the Congress. [Life of Napoleon, vol. viii.\r\nchap. 1.] But the jest was a bitter one: and they soon were deeply\r\nbusied in anxious deliberations respecting the mode in which they\r\nshould encounter their arch-enemy, who had thus started from torpor and\r\nobscurity into renovated splendour and strength:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Qualis ubi in lucem coluber mala gramina pastus,\r\n      Frigida sub terra tumidum quem bruma tegebat,\r\n      Nunc positis novus exuviis nitidusque juventa,\r\n      Lubrica convolvit sublato pectore terga\r\n      Arduus ad solem, at linguis micat ore trisulcis.\"  Virg. AEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNapoleon sought to disunite the formidable confederacy, which he knew\r\nwould be arrayed against him, by endeavouring to negotiate separately\r\nwith each of the allied sovereigns. It is said that Austria and Russia\r\nwere at first not unwilling to treat with him. Disputes and jealousies\r\nhad been rife among several of the Allies on the subject of the division\r\nof the conquered countries; and the cordial unanimity with which they\r\nhad acted during 1813 and the first months of 1814, had grown\r\nchill during some weeks of discussions. But the active exertions of\r\nTralleyrand, who represented Louis XVIII. at the Congress, and who both\r\nhated and feared Napoleon with all the intensity of which his powerful\r\nspirit was capable, prevented the secession of any member of the\r\nCongress from the new great league against their ancient enemy. Still it\r\nis highly probable that, if Napoleon had triumphed in Belgium over\r\nthe Prussians and the English, he would have succeeded in opening\r\nnegotiations with the Austrians and Russians; and he might have thus\r\ngained advantages similar to those which he had obtained on his return\r\nfrom Egypt, when he induced the Czar Paul to withdraw the Russian armies\r\nfrom co-operating with the other enemies of France in the extremity of\r\nperil to which she seemed reduced in 1799. But fortune now had deserted\r\nhim both in diplomacy and in war.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of March, 1815, the Ministers of the seven powers, Austria,\r\nSpain, England, Portugal, Prussia, Russia, and Sweden, signed a\r\nmanifesto, by which they declared Napoleon an outlaw; and this\r\ndenunciation was instantly followed up by a treaty between England,\r\nAustria, Prussia, and Russia (to which other powers soon acceded), by\r\nwhich the rulers of those countries bound themselves to enforce that\r\ndecree, and to prosecute the war until Napoleon should be driven from\r\nthe throne of France, and rendered incapable of disturbing the peace of\r\nEurope. The Duke of Wellington was the representative of England at the\r\nCongress of Vienna, and he was immediately applied to for his advice\r\non the plan of military operations against France. It was obvious that\r\nBelgium would be the first battle-field; and by the general wish of the\r\nAllies, the English Duke proceeded thither to assemble an army from the\r\ncontingents of Dutch, Belgian, and Hanoverian troops, that were most\r\nspeedily available, and from the English regiments which his own\r\nGovernment was hastening to send over from this country. A strong\r\nPrussian corps was near Aix-la-Chapelle, having remained there since\r\nthe campaign of the preceding year. This was largely reinforced by other\r\ntroops of the same nation; and Marshal Blucher, the favourite hero of\r\nthe Prussian soldiery, and the deadliest foe of France, assumed the\r\ncommand of this army, which was termed the Army of the Lower Rhine; and\r\nwhich, in conjunction with Wellington's forces, was to make the van of\r\nthe armaments of the Allied Powers. Meanwhile Prince Swartzenburg was to\r\ncollect 130,000 Austrians, and 124,000 troops of other Germanic States,\r\nas \"the Army of the Upper Rhine;\" and 168,000 Russians, under the\r\ncommand of Barclay de Tolly, were to form \"the Army of the Middle\r\nRhine,\" and to repeat the march from Muscovy to that river's banks.\r\n\r\nThe exertions which the Allied Powers thus made at this crisis to\r\ngrapple promptly with the French emperor have truly been termed\r\ngigantic; and never were Napoleon's genius and activity more signally\r\ndisplayed, than in the celerity and skill by which he brought forward\r\nall the military resources of France, which the reverses of the three\r\npreceding years, and the pacific policy of the Bourbons during\r\nthe months of their first restoration, had greatly diminished and\r\ndisorganized. He re-entered Paris on the 20th of March, and by the end\r\nof May, besides sending a force into La Vendee to put down the armed\r\nrising of the royalists in that province, and besides providing troops\r\nunder Massena and Suchet for the defence of the southern frontiers of\r\nFrance, Napoleon had an army assembled in the north-east for active\r\noperations under his own command, which amounted to between one hundred\r\nand twenty, and one hundred and thirty thousand men, with a superb park\r\nof artillery and in the highest possible state of equipment, discipline,\r\nand efficiency. [See for these numbers Siborne's History of the Campaign\r\nof Waterloo, vol. i. p. 41.]\r\n\r\nThe approach of the multitudinous Russian, Austrian, Bavarian, and other\r\nfoes of the French Emperor to the Rhine was necessarily slow; but the\r\ntwo most active of the allied powers had occupied Belgium with their\r\ntroops, while Napoleon was organizing his forces. Marshal Blucher was\r\nthere with one hundred and sixteen thousand Prussians; and, before the\r\nend of May, the Duke of Wellington was there also with about one hundred\r\nand six thousand troops, either British or in British pay. [Ibid. vol.\r\ni. chap. 3. Wellington had but a small part of his old Peninsular army\r\nin Belgium. The flower of it had been sent on the expeditions against\r\nAmerica. His troops, in 1815, were chiefly second battalions, or\r\nregiments lately filled up with new recruits. See Scott, vol viii.\r\np. 474.] Napoleon determined to attack these enemies in Belgium. The\r\ndisparity of numbers was indeed great, but delay was sure to increase\r\nthe proportionate numerical superiority of his enemies over his own\r\nranks. The French Emperor considered also that \"the enemy's troops were\r\nnow cantoned under the command of two generals, and composed of nations\r\ndiffering both in interest and in feelings.\" [See Montholon's Memoirs,\r\np. 45.] His own army was under his own sole command. It was composed\r\nexclusively of French soldiers, mostly of veterans, well acquainted with\r\ntheir officers and with each other, and full of enthusiastic confidence\r\nin their commander. If he could separate the Prussians from the British,\r\nso as to attack each singly, he felt sanguine of success, not only\r\nagainst these the most resolute of his many adversaries, but also\r\nagainst the other masses, that were slowly labouring up against his\r\neastern dominions.\r\n\r\nThe triple chain of strong fortresses, which the French possessed on the\r\nBelgian frontier, formed a curtain, behind which Napoleon was able to\r\nconcentrate his army, and to conceal, till the very last moment, the\r\nprecise line of attack which he intended to take. On the other hand,\r\nBlucher and Wellington were obliged to canton their troops along a line\r\nof open country of considerable length, so as to watch for the outbreak\r\nof Napoleon from whichever point of his chain of strongholds he should\r\nplease to make it. Blucher, with his army, occupied the banks of the\r\nSambre and the Meuse, from Liege on his left, to Charleroi on his right;\r\nand the Duke of Wellington covered Brussels; his cantonments being\r\npartly in front of that city and between it and the French frontier, and\r\npartly on its west their extreme right reaching to Courtray and Tournay,\r\nwhile the left approached Charleroi and communicated with the Prussian\r\nright. It was upon Charleroi that Napoleon resolved to level his attack,\r\nin hopes of severing the two allied armies from each other, and then\r\npursuing his favourite tactic of assailing each separately with a\r\nsuperior force on the battle-field, though the aggregate of their\r\nnumbers considerably exceeded his own.\r\n\r\nThe first French corps d'armee, commanded by Count d'Erlon, was\r\nstationed in the beginning of June in and around the city of Lille, near\r\nto the north-eastern frontier of France. The second corps, under Count\r\nReille, was at Valenciennes, to the right of the first one. The third\r\ncorps, under Count Vandamme, was at Mezieres. The fourth, under Count\r\nGerard, had its head-quarters at Metz, and the sixth under Count Lobau,\r\nwas at Laon. [The fifth corps was under Count Rapp at Strasburg.] Four\r\ncorps of reserve cavalry, under Marshal Grouchy, were also near the\r\nfrontier, between the rivers Aisne and Sambre. The Imperial Guard\r\nremained in Paris until the 8th of June, when it marched towards\r\nBelgium, and reached Avesnes on the 13th; and in the course of the same\r\nand the following day, the five corps d'armee with the cavalry reserves\r\nwhich have been mentioned, were, in pursuance of skilfully combined\r\norders, rapidly drawn together, and concentrated in and around the\r\nsame place, on the right bank of the river Sambre. On the 14th Napoleon\r\narrived among his troops, who were exulting at the display of their\r\ncommander's skill in the celerity and precision with which they had been\r\ndrawn together, and in the consciousness of their collective strength.\r\nAlthough Napoleon too often permitted himself to use language unworthy\r\nof his own character respecting his great English adversary, his real\r\nfeelings in commencing this campaign may be judged from the last words\r\nwhich he spoke, as he threw himself into his travelling carriage to\r\nleave Paris for the army. \"I go,\" he said, \"to measure myself with\r\nWellington.\"\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm of the French soldiers at seeing their Emperor among\r\nthem, was still more excited by the \"Order of the day,\" in which he thus\r\nappealed to them:\r\n\r\n\"Napoleon, by the Grace of God, and the Constitution of the Empire,\r\nEmperor of the French, &c. to the Grand Army.\r\n\r\n\"AT THE IMPERIAL HEAD-QUARTERS, AVESNES, JUNE 14th, 1815.\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers!  this day is the anniversary of Marengo and of\r\nFriedland, which twice decided the destiny of Europe. Then, as after\r\nAusterlitz, as after Wagram, we were too generous! We believed in\r\nthe protestations and in the oaths of princes, whom we left on their\r\nthrones. Now, however, leagued together, they aim at the independence\r\nand the most sacred rights of France. They have commenced the most\r\nunjust of aggressions. Let us, then, march to meet them. Are they and we\r\nno longer the same men?\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers! at Jena, against these same Prussians, now so arrogant, you\r\nwere one to three, and at Montmirail one to six!\r\n\r\n\"Let those among you who have been captives to the English, describe the\r\nnature of their prison ships, and the frightful miseries they endured.\r\n\r\n\"The Saxons, the Belgians, the Hanoverians, the soldiers of the\r\nConfederation of the Rhine, lament that they are compelled to use their\r\narms in the cause of princes, the enemies of justice and of the rights\r\nof all nations.

After\r\nhaving devoured twelve millions of Poles, twelve millions of Italians,\r\none million of Saxons, and six millions of Belgians, it now wishes to\r\ndevour the states of the second rank in Germany.\r\n\r\n\"Madmen! one moment of prosperity has bewildered them.

If they\r\nenter France they will there find their grave.\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers! we have forced marches to make, battles to fight, dangers\r\nto encounter; but, with firmness victory will, be ours. The rights, the\r\nhonour, and the happiness of the country will be recovered!\r\n\r\n\"To every Frenchman who has a heart, the moment is now arrived to\r\nconquer or to die.\r\n\r\n\"NAPOLEON.\"\r\n\r\n\"THE MARSHAL DUKE OF DALMATIA. MAJOR GENERAL.\"\r\n\r\nThe 15th of June had scarcely dawned before the French army was in\r\nmotion for the decisive campaign, and crossed the frontier in three\r\ncolumns, which were pointed upon Charleroi and its vicinity. The French\r\nline of advance upon Brussels, which city Napoleon resolved to occupy,\r\nthus lay right through the centre of the cantonments of the Allies.\r\n\r\nMuch criticism has been expended on the supposed surprise of\r\nWellington's army in its cantonments by Napoleon's rapid advance. These\r\ncomments would hardly have been made if sufficient attention had been\r\npaid to the geography of the Waterloo campaign; and if it had been\r\nremembered that the protection of Brussels was justly considered by\r\nthe allied generals a matter of primary importance. If Napoleon could,\r\neither by manoeuvring or fighting, have succeeded in occupying that\r\ncity, the greater part of Belgium would unquestionably have declared in\r\nhis favour; and the results of such a success, gained by the Emperor at\r\nthe commencement of the campaign, might have decisively influenced\r\nthe whole after-current of events. A glance at the map will show the\r\nnumerous roads that lead from the different fortresses on the French\r\nnorth-eastern frontier, and converge upon Brussels; any one of which\r\nNapoleon might have chosen for the advance of a strong force upon that\r\ncity. The Duke's army was judiciously arranged, so as to enable him to\r\nconcentrate troops on any one of these roads sufficiently in advance of\r\nBrussels to check an assailing enemy. The army was kept thus available\r\nfor movement in any necessary direction, till certain intelligence\r\narrived on the 15th of June that the French had crossed the frontier in\r\nlarge force near Thuin, that they had driven back the Prussian advanced\r\ntroops under General Ziethen, and were also moving across the Sambre\r\nupon Charleroi.\r\n\r\nMarshal Blucher now rapidly concentrated his forces, calling them in\r\nfrom the left upon Ligny, which is to the north-east of Charleroi.\r\nWellington also drew his troops together, calling them in from the\r\nright. But even now, though it was certain that the French were in large\r\nforce at Charleroi it was unsafe for the English general to place his\r\narmy directly between that place and Brussels, until it was certain that\r\nno corps of the enemy was marching upon Brussels by the western road\r\nthrough Mons and Hal. The Duke therefore, collected his troops in\r\nBrussels and its immediate vicinity, ready to move due southward upon\r\nQuatre Bras, and co-operate with Blucher, who was taking his station at\r\nLigny: but also ready to meet and defeat any manoeuvre, that the enemy\r\nmight make to turn the right of the Allies, and occupy Brussels by\r\na flanking movement. The testimony of the Prussian general, Baron\r\nMuffling, who was attached to the Duke's staff during the campaign, and\r\nwho expressly states the reasons on which the English general acted,\r\nought for ever to have silenced the \"weak inventions of the enemy\"\r\nabout the Duke of Wellington having been deceived and surprised by his\r\nassailant, which some writers of our own nation, as well as foreigners,\r\nhave incautiously repeated. [See \"Passages from my Life and Writings,\"\r\nby Baron Muffling, p. 224 of the English Translation, edited by Col.\r\nYorke. See also the 178th number of the QUARTERLY. It is strange that\r\nLamartine should, after the appearance of Muffling's work, have repeated\r\nin his \"History of the Restoration\" the myth of Wellington having been\r\nsurprised in the Brussels ball-room, &c.]\r\n\r\nIt was about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 15th, that a Prussian\r\nofficer reached Brussels, whom General Ziethen had sent to Muffling\r\nto inform him of the advance of the main French army upon Charleroi.\r\nMuffling immediately communicated this to the Duke of Wellington; and\r\nasked him whether he would now concentrate his army, and what would\r\nbe his point of concentration; observing that Marshal Blucher in\r\nconsequence of this intelligence would certainly concentrate the\r\nPrussians at Ligny. The Duke replied--\"If all is as General Ziethen\r\nsupposes, I will concentrate on my left wing, and so be in readiness to\r\nfight in conjunction with the Prussian army. Should, however, a portion\r\nof the enemy's force come by Mons, I must concentrate more towards my\r\ncentre. This is the reason why I must wait for positive news from Mons\r\nbefore I fix the rendezvous. Since, however, it is certain that the\r\ntroops MUST march, though it is uncertain upon what precise spot they\r\nmust march, I will order all to be in readiness, and will direct a\r\nbrigade to move at once towards Quatre Bras.\" [Muffling, p. 231.]\r\n\r\nLater in the same day a message from Blucher himself was delivered to\r\nMuffling, in which the Prussian Field-Marshal informed the Baron that he\r\nwas concentrating his men at Sombref and Ligny, and charged Muffling to\r\ngive him speedy intelligence respecting the concentration of Wellington.\r\nMuffling immediately communicated this to the Duke, who expressed his\r\nsatisfaction with Blucher's arrangements, but added that he could not\r\neven then resolve upon his own point of concentration before he obtained\r\nthe desired intelligence from Mons. About midnight this information\r\narrived. The Duke went to the quarters of General Muffling, and told\r\nhim that he now had received his reports from Mons, and was sure that\r\nno French troops were advancing by that route, but that the mass of\r\nthe enemy's force was decidedly directed on Charleroi. He informed the\r\nPrussian general that he had ordered the British troops to move forward\r\nupon Quatre Bras; but with characteristic coolness and sagacity resolved\r\nnot to give the appearance of alarm by hurrying on with them himself. A\r\nball was to be given by the Duchess of Richmond at Brussels that night,\r\nand the Duke proposed to General Muffling that they should go to the\r\nball for a few hours, and ride forward in the morning to overtake the\r\ntroops at Quatre Bras.\r\n\r\nTo hundreds, who were assembled at that memorable ball, the news that\r\nthe enemy was advancing, and that the time for battle had come, must\r\nhave been a fearfully exciting surprise, and the magnificent stanzas of\r\nByron are as true as they are beautiful; but the Duke and his principal\r\nofficers knew well the stern termination to that festive scene which\r\nwas approaching. One by one, and in such a way as to attract as little\r\nobservation as possible, the leaders of the various corps left the\r\nball-room, and took their stations at the head of their men, who were\r\npressing forward through the last hours of the short summer night to the\r\narena of anticipated slaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [There was a sound of revelry by night,\r\n      And Belgium's capital had gather'd then\r\n      Her Beauty and her chivalry, and bright\r\n      The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;\r\n      A thousand hearts beat happily; and when\r\n      Music arose with its voluptuous swell,\r\n      Soft eyes look'd love to eyes which spake again,\r\n      And all went merry as a marriage bell;\r\n      But hush!  hark!  a deep sound strikes like a rising knell,\r\n\r\n      Did ye not hear it?--No; 'twas but; the wind,\r\n      Or the car rattling o'er the stony street;\r\n      On with the dance!  let joy be unconfined;\r\n      No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet\r\n      To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet--\r\n      But, hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more,\r\n      As if the clouds its echo would repeat;\r\n      And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!\r\n      Arm!  Arm!  it is--it is--the cannon's opening roar!\r\n\r\n      Within a window'd niche of that high hall\r\n      Sate Brunswick's fated chieftain; he did hear\r\n      That sound the first amidst the festival,\r\n      And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;\r\n      And when they smiled because he deem'd it near,\r\n      His heart more truly knew that peal too well\r\n      Which stretch'd his father on a bloody bier,\r\n      And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell;\r\n      He rush'd into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.\r\n\r\n      Ah!  then and there was hurrying to and fro,\r\n      And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,\r\n      And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago\r\n      Blush'd at the praise of their own loveliness;\r\n      And there were sudden partings, such as press\r\n      The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs\r\n      Which ne'er might be repeated; who could guess\r\n      If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,\r\n      Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise!\r\n\r\n      And there was mounting in hot haste:  the steed,\r\n      The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,\r\n      Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,\r\n      And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;\r\n      And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;\r\n      And near, the beat of the alarming drum\r\n      Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;\r\n      While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,\r\n      Or whispering, with white lips--\"The foe!\r\n      They come! they come!\"\r\n\r\n      And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,\r\n      Dewy with nature's teardrops, as they pass,\r\n      Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,\r\n      Over the unreturning brave,--alas!\r\n      Ere evening to be trodden like the grass\r\n      Which now beneath them, but above shall grow\r\n      In its next verdure, when this fiery mass\r\n      Of living valour, rolling on the foe\r\n      And burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low.\r\n\r\n      Last noon beheld them full of lusty life,\r\n      Last eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay,\r\n      The midnight brought the signal-sound of strife,\r\n      The morn the marshalling in arms,--the day\r\n      Battle's magnificently stern array!\r\n      The thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent\r\n      The earth is covered thick with other clay,\r\n      Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,\r\n      Rider and horse,--friend, foe,--in one red burial blent.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNapoleon's operations on the 16th had been conducted with signal skill\r\nand vigour; and their results had been very advantageous for his plan of\r\nthe campaign. With his army formed in three vast columns, [Victoires et\r\nConquetes des Francais, vol. xxv. p. 177.] he had struck at the centre\r\nof the line of cantonments of his allied foes; and he had so far made\r\ngood his blow, that he had affected the passage of the Sambre, he had\r\nbeaten with his left wing the Prussian corps of General Ziethen at\r\nThuin, and with his centre he had in person advanced right through\r\nCharleroi upon Fleurus, inflicting considerable loss upon the Prussians\r\nthat fell back before him. His right column had with little opposition\r\nmoved forward as far as the bridge of Chatelet.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had thus a powerful force immediately in front of the point\r\nwhich Blucher had fixed for the concentration of the Prussian army, and\r\nthat concentration was still incomplete. The French Emperor designed\r\nto attack the Prussians on the morrow in person, with the troops of his\r\ncentre and right columns, and to employ his left wing in beating back\r\nsuch English troops as might advance to the help of their allies, and\r\nalso in aiding his own attack upon Blucher. He gave the command of this\r\nleft wing to Marshal Ney. Napoleon seems not to have originally intended\r\nto employ this celebrated General in the campaign. It was only on the\r\nnight of the 11th of June, that Marshal Ney received at Paris an order\r\nto join the army. Hurrying forward to the Belgian frontier, he met the\r\nEmperor near Charleroi. Napoleon immediately directed him to take the\r\ncommand of the left wing, and to press forward with it upon Quatre Bras\r\nby the line of the road which leads from Charleroi to Brussels, through\r\nGosselies, Frasne, Quatre Bras, Genappe, and Waterloo. Ney immediately\r\nproceeded to the post assigned him; and before ten on the night of the\r\n15th he had occupied Gosselies and Frasne, driving out without much\r\ndifficulty some weak Belgian detachments which had been stationed in\r\nthose villages. The lateness of the hour, and the exhausted state of\r\nthe French troops, who had been marching and fighting since ten in the\r\nmorning, made him pause from advancing further to attack the much more\r\nimportant position of Quatre Bras. In truth, the advantages which the\r\nFrench gained by their almost superhuman energy and activity throughout\r\nthe long day of the 15th of June, were necessarily bought at the price\r\nof more delay and inertness during the following night and morrow, than\r\nwould have been observable if they had not been thus overtasked. Ney has\r\nbeen blamed for want of promptness in his attack upon Quatre Bras; and\r\nNapoleon has been criticised for not having fought at Ligny before the\r\nafternoon of the 16th: but their censors should remember that soldiers\r\nare but men; and that there must be necessarily some interval of time,\r\nbefore troops, that have been worn and weakened by twenty hours of\r\nincessant fatigue and strife, can be fed, rested, reorganized, and\r\nbrought again into action with any hope of success.\r\n\r\nHaving on the night of the 15th placed the most advanced of the French\r\nunder his command in position in front of Frasne, Ney rode back to\r\nCharleroi, where Napoleon also arrived about midnight, having returned\r\nfrom directing the operations of the centre and right column of the\r\nFrench. The Emperor and the Marshal supped together, and remained in\r\nearnest conversation till two in the morning. An hour or two afterwards\r\nNey rode back to Frasne, where he endeavoured to collect tidings of\r\nthe numbers and movements of the enemy in front of him; and also busied\r\nhimself in the necessary duty of learning the amount and composition\r\nof the troops which he himself was commanding. He had been so suddenly\r\nappointed to his high station, that he did not know the strength of\r\nthe several regiments under him, or even the names of their commanding\r\nofficers. He now caused his aides-de-camp to prepare the requisite\r\nreturns, and drew together the troops, whom he was thus learning before\r\nhe used them.\r\n\r\nWellington remained at the Duchess of Richmond's ball at Brussels till\r\nabout three o'clock in the morning of the 16th, \"showing himself very\r\ncheerful\" as Baron Muffling, who accompanied him, observes. [Muffling,\r\np. 233.] At five o'clock the Duke and the Baron were on horseback, and\r\nreached the position at Quatre Bras about eleven. As the French, who\r\nwere in front of Frasne, were perfectly quiet, and the Duke was informed\r\nthat a very large force under Napoleon in person was menacing Blucher,\r\nit was thought possible that only a slight detachment of the French\r\nwas posted at Frasne in order to mask the English army. In that event\r\nWellington, as he told Baron Muffling, would be able to employ his whole\r\nstrength in supporting the Prussians: and he proposed to ride across\r\nfrom Quatre Bras to Blucher's position, in order to concert with him\r\npersonally the measures which should be taken in order to bring on\r\na decisive battle with the French. Wellington and Muffling rode\r\naccordingly towards Ligny, and found Marshal Blucher and his staff\r\nat the windmill of Bry, near that village. The Prussian army, 80,000\r\nstrong, was drawn up chiefly along a chain of heights, with the villages\r\nof Sombref, St. Amand, and Ligny in their front. These villages were\r\nstrongly occupied by Prussian detachments, and formed the keys of\r\nBlucher's position. The heads of the columns which Napoleon was forming\r\nfor the attack, were visible in the distance. The Duke asked Blucher\r\nand General Gneisenau (who was Blucher's adviser in matters of strategy)\r\nwhat they wished him to do, Muffling had already explained to them in\r\na few words the Duke's earnest desire to support the Field-Marshal, and\r\nthat he would do all that they wished, provided they did not ask him to\r\ndivide his army, which was contrary to his principles. The Duke wished\r\nto advance with his army (as soon as it was concentrated) upon Frasne\r\nand Gosselies, and thence to move upon Napoleon's flank and rear. The\r\nPrussian leaders preferred that he should march his men from Quatre Bras\r\nby the Namur road, so as to form a reserve in rear of Blucher's army.\r\nThe Duke replied, \"Well, I will come if I am not attacked myself,\" and\r\ngalloped back with Muffling to Quatre Bras, where the French attack was\r\nnow actually raging.\r\n\r\nMarshal Ney began the battle about two o'clock in the afternoon. He had\r\nat this time in hand about 16,000 infantry, nearly 2,000 cavalry, and 38\r\nguns. The force which Napoleon nominally placed at his command exceeded\r\n40,000 men. But more than one half of these consisted of the first\r\nFrench corps d'armee, under Count d'Erlon; and Ney was deprived of the\r\nuse of this corps at the time that he most required it, in consequence\r\nof its receiving orders to march to the aid of the Emperor at Ligny. A\r\nmagnificent body of heavy cavalry under Kellerman, nearly 5,000 strong,\r\nand several more battalions of artillery were added to Ney's army\r\nduring the battle of Quatre Bras; but his effective infantry force never\r\nexceeded 16,000.\r\n\r\nWhen the battle began, the greater part of the Duke's army was yet on\r\nits march towards Quatre Bras from Brussels and the other parts of\r\nits cantonments. The force of the Allies, actually in position there,\r\nconsisted only of a Dutch and Belgian division of infantry, not quite\r\n7,000 strong, with one battalion of foot, and one of horse-artillery.\r\nThe Prince of Orange commanded them. A wood, called the Bois de Bossu,\r\nstretched along the right (or western) flank of the position of Quatre\r\nBras; a farmhouse and building, called Gemiancourt, stood on some\r\nelevated ground in its front; and to the left (or east), were\r\nthe inclosures of the village of Pierremont. The Prince of Orange\r\nendeavoured to secure these posts; but Ney carried Gemiancourt in\r\nthe centre, and Pierremont on the east, and gained occupation of the\r\nsouthern part of the wood of Bossu. He ranged the chief part of his\r\nartillery on the high ground of Gemiancourt, whence it played throughout\r\nthe action with most destructive effect upon the Allies. He was pressing\r\nforward to further advantages, when the fifth infantry division under\r\nSir Thomas Picton and the Duke of Brunswick's corps appeared upon the\r\nscene. Wellington (who had returned to Quatre Bras from his interview\r\nwith Blucher shortly before the arrival of these forces) restored the\r\nfight with them; and, as fresh troops of the Allies arrived, they were\r\nbrought forward to stem the fierce attacks which Ney's columns and\r\nsquadrons continued to make with unabated gallantry and zeal. The only\r\ncavalry of the anglo-allied army that reached Quatre Bras during\r\nthe action, consisted of Dutch and Belgians, and a small force of\r\nBrunswickers, under their Duke, who was killed on the field. These\r\nproved wholly unable to encounter Kellerman's cuirassiers and Pire's\r\nlancers; the Dutch and Belgian infantry also gave way early in the\r\nengagement; so that the whole brunt of the battle fell on the British\r\nand German infantry. They sustained it nobly. Though repeatedly charged\r\nby the French cavalry, though exposed to the murderous fire of the\r\nFrench batteries, which from the heights of Gemiancourt sent shot and\r\nshell into the devoted squares whenever the French horseman withdrew,\r\nthey not only repelled their assailants, but Kempt's and Pack's\r\nbrigades, led, on by Picton, actually advanced against and through their\r\ncharging foes, and with stern determination made good to the end of the\r\nday the ground which they had thus boldly won. Some, however, of the\r\nBritish regiments were during the confusion assailed by the French\r\ncavalry before they could form squares, and suffered severely. One\r\nregiment, the 92d, was almost wholly destroyed by the cuirassiers. A\r\nFrench private soldier, named Lami, of the 8th regiment of cuirassiers,\r\ncaptured one of the English colours, and presented it to Ney. It was a\r\nsolitary trophy. The arrival of the English Guards about half-past six\r\no'clock, enabled the Duke to recover the wood of Bossu, which the French\r\nhad almost entirely won, and the possession of which by them would have\r\nenabled Ney to operate destructively upon the allied flank and rear.\r\nNot only was the wood of Bossu recovered on the British right, but the\r\ninclosures of Pierremont were also carried on the left. When night set\r\nin the French had been driven back on all points towards Frasne; but\r\nthey still held the farm of Gemiancourt in front of the Duke's centre.\r\nWellington and Muffling were unacquainted with the result of the\r\ncollateral battle between Blucher and Napoleon, the cannonading of which\r\nhad been distinctly audible at Quatre Bras throughout the afternoon and\r\nevening. The Duke observed to Muffling, that of course the two Allied\r\narmies would assume the offensive against the enemy on the morrow; and\r\nconsequently, it would be better to capture the farm at once, instead\r\nof waiting till next morning. Muffling agreed in the Duke's views and\r\nGemiancourt was forthwith attacked by the English and captured with\r\nlittle loss to its assailants. [Muffling, p. 242.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the French and the Prussians had been fighting in and round\r\nthe villages of Ligny, Sombref, and St. Armand, from three in the\r\nafternoon to nine in the evening, with a savage inveteracy almost\r\nunparalleled in modern warfare. Blucher had in the field, when he began\r\nthe battle, 83,417 men, and 224 guns. Bulow's corps, which was 25,000\r\nstrong, had not joined him; but the Field-Marshal hoped to be reinforced\r\nby it, or by the English army before the end of the action. But Bulow,\r\nthrough some error in the transmission of orders, was far in the rear;\r\nand the Duke of Wellington was engaged, as we have seen, with Marshal\r\nNey. Blucher received early warning from Baron Muffling that the Duke\r\ncould not come to his assistance; but, as Muffling observes, Wellington\r\nrendered the Prussians the great service of occupying more than 40,000\r\nof the enemy, who otherwise would have crushed Blucher's right flank.\r\nFor, not only did the conflict at Quatre Bras detain the French troops\r\nwhich actually took part in it, but d'Erlon received orders from Ney to\r\njoin him, which hindered d'Erlon from giving effectual aid to Napoleon.\r\nIndeed, the whole of d'Erlon's corps, in consequence of conflicting\r\ndirections from Ney and the Emperor, marched and countermarched, during\r\nthe 16th, between Quatre Bras and Ligny without firing a shot in either\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nBlucher had, in fact, a superiority of more than 12,000 in number over\r\nthe French army that attacked him at Ligny. The numerical difference was\r\neven greater at the beginning of the battle, as Lobau's corps did not\r\ncome up from Charleroi till eight o'clock. After five hours and a half\r\nof desperate and long-doubtful struggle, Napoleon succeeded in breaking\r\nthe centre of the Prussian line at Ligny, and in forcing his obstinate\r\nantagonists off the field of battle. The issue was attributable to his\r\nskill, and not to any want of spirit or resolution on the part of\r\nthe Prussian troops; nor did they, though defeated, abate one jot in\r\ndiscipline, heart, or hope. As Blucher observed, it was a battle in\r\nwhich his army lost the day but not its honour. The Prussians retreated\r\nduring the night of the 16th, and the early part of the 17th, with\r\nperfect regularity and steadiness, The retreat was directed not towards\r\nMaestricht, where their principal depots were established, but\r\ntowards Wavre, so as to be able to maintain their communication with\r\nWellington's army, and still follow out the original plan of the\r\ncampaign. The heroism with which the Prussians endured and repaired\r\ntheir defeat at Ligny, is more glorious than many victories.\r\n\r\nThe messenger who was sent to inform Wellington of the retreat of the\r\nPrussian army, was shot on the way; and it was not until the morning of\r\nthe 17th that the Allies, at Quatre Bras, knew the result of the battle\r\nof Ligny. The Duke was ready at daybreak to take the offensive\r\nagainst the enemy with vigour, his whole army being by that time fully\r\nassembled. But on learning that Blucher had been defeated, a different\r\ncourse of action was clearly necessary. It was obvious that Napoleon's\r\nmain army would now be directed against Wellington, and a retreat was\r\ninevitable. On ascertaining that the Prussian army had retired upon\r\nWavre, that there was no hot pursuit of them by the French, and that\r\nBulow's corps had taken no part in the action at Ligny, the Duke\r\nresolved to march his army back towards Brussels, still intending to\r\ncover that city, and to halt at a point in a line with Wavre, and there\r\nrestore his communication with Blucher. An officer from Blucher's army\r\nreached the Duke about nine o'clock, from whom he learned the effective\r\nstrength that Blucher still possessed, and how little discouraged his\r\nally was by the yesterday's battle. Wellington sent word to the Prussian\r\ncommander that he would halt in the position of Mont St. Jean, and\r\naccept a general battle with the French, if Blucher would pledge himself\r\nto come to his assistance with a single corps of 25,000 men. This was\r\nreadily promised; and after allowing his men ample time for rest and\r\nrefreshment, Wellington retired over about half the space between Quatre\r\nBras and Brussels. He was pursued, but little molested, by the main\r\nFrench army, which about noon of the 17th moved laterally from Ligny,\r\nand joined Ney's forces, which had advanced through Quatre Bras when the\r\nBritish abandoned that position. The Earl of Uxbridge, with the British\r\ncavalry, covered the retreat of the Duke's army, with great skill and\r\ngallantry; and a heavy thunderstorm, with torrents of rain, impeded the\r\noperations of the French pursuing squadrons. The Duke still expected\r\nthat the French would endeavour to turn his right, and march upon\r\nBrussels by the high road that leads through Mons and Hal. In order to\r\ncounteract this anticipated manoeuvre, he stationed a force of 18,000\r\nmen, under Prince Frederick of the Netherlands, at Hal, with orders to\r\nmaintain himself there if attacked, as long as possible. The Duke halted\r\nwith the rest of his army at the position near Mont St. Jean, which,\r\nfrom a village in its neighbourhood, has received the ever-memorable\r\nname of the field of Waterloo.\r\n\r\nWellington was now about twelve miles distant, on a line running\r\nfrom west to east, from Wavre, where the Prussian army had now been\r\ncompletely reorganised and collected, and where it had been strengthened\r\nby the junction of Bulow's troops, which had taken no part in the battle\r\nof Ligny. Blucher sent word from Wavre to the Duke, that he was coming\r\nto help the English at Mont St. Jean, in the morning, not with one\r\ncorps, but with his whole army. The fiery old man only stipulated that\r\nthe combined armies, if not attacked by Napoleon on the 18th, should\r\nthemselves attack him on the 19th. So far were Blucher and his army from\r\nbeing in the state of annihilation described in the boastful bulletin by\r\nwhich Napoleon informed the Parisians of his victory at Ligny. Indeed,\r\nthe French Emperor seems himself to have been misinformed as to the\r\nextent of loss which he had inflicted on the Prussians. Had he known in\r\nwhat good order and with what undiminished spirit they were retiring, he\r\nwould scarcely have delayed sending a large force to press them in their\r\nretreat until noon on the 17th. Such, however, was the case. It was\r\nabout that time that he confided to Marshal Grouchy the duty of pursuing\r\nthe defeated Prussians, and preventing them from joining Wellington. He\r\nplaced for this purpose 32,000 men and 96 guns under his orders. Violent\r\ncomplaints and recriminations passed afterwards between the Emperor and\r\nthe marshal respecting the manner in which Grouchy attempted to perform\r\nthis duty, and the reasons why he failed on the 18th to arrest the\r\nlateral movement of the Prussians from Wavre to Waterloo. It is\r\nsufficient to remark here, that the force which Napoleon gave to Grouchy\r\n(though the utmost that the Emperor's limited means would allow) was\r\ninsufficient to make head against the entire Prussian army, especially\r\nafter Bulow's junction with Blucher. We shall presently have occasion to\r\nconsider what opportunities were given to Grouchy during the 18th, and\r\nwhat he might have effected if he had been a man of original military\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nBut the failure of Grouchy was in truth mainly owing to the indomitable\r\nheroism of Blucher himself; who, though he had received severe personal\r\ninjuries in the battle of Ligny, was as energetic and ready as ever in\r\nbringing his men into action again, and who had the resolution to expose\r\na part of his army, under Thielman, to be overwhelmed by Grouchy at\r\nWavre on the 18th, while he urged the march of the mass of his troops\r\nupon Waterloo. \"It is not at Wavre, but at Waterloo,\" said the old\r\nField-Marshal, \"that the campaign is to be decided;\" and he risked a\r\ndetachment, and won the campaign accordingly. Wellington and Blucher\r\ntrusted each other as cordially, and co-operated as zealously, as\r\nformerly had been the case with Marlborough and Eugene. It was in full\r\nreliance on Blucher's promise to join him that the Duke stood his ground\r\nand fought at Waterloo; and those who have ventured to impugn the\r\nDuke's capacity as a general, ought to have had common-sense enough to\r\nperceive, that to charge the Duke with having won the battle of Waterloo\r\nby the help of the Prussians, is really to say that he won it by the\r\nvery means on which he relied, and without the expectation of which the\r\nbattle would not have been fought.\r\n\r\nNapoleon himself has found fault with Wellington for not having\r\nretreated further, so as to complete a junction of his army with\r\nBlucher's before he risked a general engagement. [See Montholon's\r\nMemoirs, vol. iv. p. 44.] But, as we have seen, the Duke justly\r\nconsidered it important to protect Brussels. He had reason to expect\r\nthat his army could singly resist the French at Waterloo until the\r\nPrussians came up; and that, on the Prussians joining, there would be\r\na sufficient force united under himself and Blucher for completely\r\noverwhelming the enemy. And while Napoleon thus censures his great\r\nadversary, he involuntarily bears the highest possible testimony to\r\nthe military character of the English, and proves decisively of what\r\nparamount importance was the battle to which he challenged his fearless\r\nopponent. Napoleon asks, \"IF THE ENGLISH ARMY HAD BEEN BEATEN AT\r\nWATERLOO, WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE USE OF THOSE NUMEROUS BODIES OF\r\nTROOPS, OF PRUSSIANS, AUSTRIANS, GERMANS, AND SPANIARDS, WHICH WERE\r\nADVANCING BY FORCED MARCHES TO THE RHINE, THE ALPS, AND THE PYRENEES?\"\r\n[Ibid.]\r\n\r\nThe strength of the army under the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo was\r\n49,608 infantry, 12,402 cavalry, and 5,645 artillerymen with 156 guns.\r\n[Siborne, vol. i. p. 376.] But of this total of 67,655 men, scarcely\r\n24,000 were British, a circumstance of very serious importance, if\r\nNapoleon's own estimate of the relative value of troops of different\r\nnations is to be taken. In the Emperor's own words, speaking of this\r\ncampaign, \"A French soldier would not be equal to more than one English\r\nsoldier, but he would not be afraid to meet two Dutchmen, Prussians, or\r\nsoldiers of the Confederation.\" [Montholon's Memoirs, vol. iv. p. 41.]\r\nThere were about 6,000 men of the old German Legion with the Duke; these\r\nwere veteran troops, and of excellent quality. Of the rest of the\r\narmy the Hanoverians and Brunswickers proved themselves deserving of\r\nconfidence and praise. But the Nassauers, Dutch, and Belgians were\r\nalmost worthless; and not a few of them were justly suspected of a\r\nstrong wish to fight, if they fought at all, under the French eagles\r\nrather than against them.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's army at Waterloo consisted of 48,950 infantry, 15,765\r\ncavalry, 7,232 artillerymen, being a total of 71,947 men, and 246 guns.\r\n[See Siborne, UT SUPRA.] They were the flower of the national forces of\r\nFrance; and of all the numerous gallant armies which that martial land\r\nhas poured forth, never was there one braver, or better disciplined, or\r\nbetter led, than the host that took up its position at Waterloo on the\r\nmorning of the 18th of June, 1815.\r\n\r\nPerhaps those who have not seen the field of battle at Waterloo, or the\r\nadmirable model of the ground, and of the conflicting armies, which was\r\nexecuted by Captain Siborne, may gain a generally accurate idea of the\r\nlocalities, by picturing to themselves a valley between two and three\r\nmiles long, of various breadths at different points, but generally not\r\nexceeding half a mile. On each side of the valley there is a winding\r\nchain of low hills running somewhat parallel, with each other. The\r\ndeclivity from each of these ranges of hills to the intervening valley\r\nis gentle but not uniform, the undulations of the ground being frequent\r\nand considerable. The English army was posted on the northern, and the\r\nFrench army occupied the southern ridge. The artillery of each side\r\nthundered at the other from their respective heights throughout the day,\r\nand the charges of horse and foot were made across the valley that has\r\nbeen described. The village of Mont St. Jean is situate a little behind\r\nthe centre of the northern chain of hills, and the village of La Belle\r\nAlliance is close behind the centre of the southern ridge. The high road\r\nfrom Charleroi to Brussels (a broad paved causeway) runs through both\r\nthese villages, and bisects therefore both the English and the French\r\npositions. The line of this road was the line of Napoleon's intended\r\nadvance on Brussels.\r\n\r\nThere are some other local particulars connected with the situation of\r\neach army, which it is necessary to bear in mind. The strength of the\r\nBritish position did not consist merely in the occupation of a ridge of\r\nhigh ground. A village and ravine, called Merk Braine, on the Duke of\r\nWellington's extreme right, secured his flank from being turned on that\r\nside; and on his extreme left, two little hamlets called La Haye and\r\nPapelotte, gave a similar, though a slighter, protection. Behind the\r\nwhole British position is the extensive forest of Soignies. As no\r\nattempt was made by the French to turn either of the English flanks,\r\nand the battle was a day of straightforward fighting, it is chiefly\r\nimportant to ascertain what posts there were in front of the British\r\nline of hills, of which advantage could be taken either to repel or\r\nfacilitate an attack; and it will be seen that there were two, and that\r\neach was of very great importance in the action. In front of the British\r\nright, that is to say, on the northern slope of the valley towards its\r\nwestern end, there stood an old-fashioned Flemish farm-house called\r\nGoumont, or Hougoumont, with out-buildings and a garden, and with a\r\ncopse of beach trees of about two acres in extent round it. This was\r\nstrongly garrisoned by the allied troops; and, while it was in their\r\npossession, it was difficult for the enemy to press on and force the\r\nBritish right wing. On the other hand, if the enemy could take it, it\r\nwould be difficult for that wing to keep its ground on the heights, with\r\na strong post held adversely in its immediate front, being one that;\r\nwould give much shelter to the enemy's marksmen, and great facilities\r\nfor the sudden concentration of attacking columns. Almost immediately\r\nin front of the British centre, and not so far down the slope as\r\nHougoumont, there was another farm-house, of a smaller size, called La\r\nHaye Sainte, [Not to be confounded with the hamlet of La Haye at the\r\nextreme left of the British line.] which was also held by the British\r\ntroops, and the occupation of which was found to be of very serious\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the French position, the principal feature to be noticed\r\nis the village of Planchenoit, which lay a little in the rear of their\r\nright (I.E. on the eastern side), and which proved to be of great\r\nimportance in aiding them to check the advance of the Prussians.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, in his memoirs, and other French writers, have vehemently\r\nblamed the Duke for having given battle in such a position as that of\r\nWaterloo. They particularly object that the Duke fought without\r\nhaving the means of a retreat, if the attacks of his enemy had proved\r\nsuccessful; and that the English army, if once broken, must have lost\r\nall its guns and MATERIEL in its flight through the Forest of Soignies,\r\nthat lay in its rear. In answer to these censures, instead of merely\r\nreferring to the event of the battle as proof of the correctness of the\r\nDuke's judgment, it is to be observed that many military critics of\r\nhigh authority, have considered the position of Waterloo to have been\r\nadmirably adapted for the Duke's purpose of protecting Brussels by a\r\nbattle; and that certainly the Duke's opinion in favour of it was not\r\nlightly or hastily formed. It is a remarkable fact (mentioned in the\r\nspeech of Lord Bathurst when moving the vote of thanks to the Duke in\r\nthe House of Lords), [Parliamentary Debates, vol. xxxi. p. 875.] that\r\nwhen the Duke of Wellington was passing through Belgium in the preceding\r\nsummer of 1814, he particularly noticed the strength of the position of\r\nWaterloo, and made a minute of it at the time, stating to those who were\r\nwith him, that if it ever should be his fate to fight a battle in that\r\nquarter for the protection of Brussels, he should endeavour to do so\r\nin that position. And with respect to the Forest of Soignies, which the\r\nFrench (and some few English) critics have thought calculated to prove\r\nso fatal to a retreating force, the Duke on the contrary believed it to\r\nbe a post that might have proved of infinite value to his army in the\r\nevent of his having been obliged to give way. The Forest of Soignies\r\nhas no thicket or masses of close-growing trees. It consists of tall\r\nbeeches, and is everywhere passable for men and horses. The artillery\r\ncould have been withdrawn by the broad road which traverses it towards\r\nBrussels; and in the meanwhile a few regiments of resolute infantry\r\ncould have held the forest and kept the pursuers in check. One of\r\nthe best writers on the Waterloo campaign, Captain Pringle, [See the\r\nAppendix to the 8th volume of Scott's Life of Napoleon.] well observes\r\nthat \"every person, the least experienced in war, knows the extreme\r\ndifficulty of forcing infantry from a wood which cannot be turned.\" The\r\ndefence of the Bois de Bossu near Quatre Bras on the 16th of June had\r\ngiven a good proof of this; and the Duke of Wellington, when speaking\r\nin after years of the possible events that might have followed if he had\r\nbeen beaten back from the open field of Waterloo, pointed to the wood\r\nof Soignies as his secure rallying place, saying, \"they never could have\r\nbeaten us so, that we could not have held the wood against them.\" He was\r\nalways confident that he could have made good that post until joined by\r\nthe Prussians, upon whose co-operation he throughout depended. [See\r\nLord Ellesmere's Life and Character of the Duke of Wellington, p. 40.]\r\n\r\nAs has been already mentioned, the Prussians, on the morning of the\r\n18th, were at Wavre, which is about twelve miles to the east of the\r\nfield of battle of Waterloo. The junction of Bulow's division had more\r\nthan made up for the loss sustained at Ligny; and leaving Thielman\r\nwith about seventeen thousand men to hold his ground, as he best could,\r\nagainst the attack which Grouchy was about to make on Wavre, Bulow and\r\nBlucher moved with the rest of the Prussians through St. Lambert upon\r\nWaterloo. It was calculated that they would be there by three o'clock;\r\nbut the extremely difficult nature of the ground which they had to\r\ntraverse, rendered worse by the torrents of rain that had just fallen,\r\ndelayed them long on their twelve miles' march.\r\n\r\nAn army indeed, less animated by bitter hate against the enemy than was\r\nthe Prussians, and under a less energetic chief than Blucher, would have\r\nfailed altogether in effecting a passage through the swamps, into\r\nwhich the incessant rain had transformed the greater part of the ground\r\nthrough which it was necessary to move not only with columns of foot,\r\nbut with cavalry and artillery. At one point of the march, on entering\r\nthe defile of St. Lambert, the spirits of the Prussians almost gave way.\r\nExhausted in the attempts to extricate and drag forward the heavy guns,\r\nthe men began to murmur. Blucher came to the spot, and heard cries from\r\nthe ranks of--\"We cannot get on.\" \"But you must get on,\" was the old\r\nField-Marshal's answer. \"I have pledged my word to Wellington, and you\r\nsurely will not make me break it. Only exert yourselves for a few hours\r\nlonger, and we are sure of victory.\" This appeal from old \"Marshal\r\nForwards,\" as the Prussian soldiers loved to call Blucher, had its\r\nwonted affect. The Prussians again moved forward, slowly, indeed, and\r\nwith pain and toil; but still they moved forward. [See Siborne, vol. ii.\r\np. 137.]\r\n\r\nThe French and British armies lay on the open field during the wet and\r\nstormy night of the 17th; and when the dawn of the memorable 18th of\r\nJune broke, the rain was still descending heavily upon Waterloo. The\r\nrival nations rose from their dreary bivouacs, and began to form, each\r\non the high ground which it occupied. Towards nine the weather grew\r\nclearer, and each army was able to watch the position and arrangements\r\nof the other on the opposite side of the valley.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington drew up his army in two lines; the principal one\r\nbeing stationed near the crest of the ridge of hills already described,\r\nand the other being arranged along the slope in the rear of his\r\nposition. Commencing from the eastward, on the extreme left of the first\r\nor main line, were Vivian's and Vandeleur's brigades of light cavalry,\r\nand the fifth Hanoverian brigade of infantry, under Von Vincke. Then\r\ncame Best's fourth Hanoverian brigade. Detachments from these bodies of\r\ntroops occupied the little villages of Papelotte and La Haye, down the\r\nhollow in advance of the left of the Duke's position. To the right of\r\nBest's Hanoverians, Bylandt's brigade of Dutch and Belgian infantry was\r\ndrawn up on the outer slope of the heights. Behind them were the ninth\r\nbrigade of British infantry under Pack; and to the right of these last,\r\nbut more in advance, stood the eighth brigade of English infantry under\r\nKempt. These were close to the Charleroi road, and to the centre of the\r\nentire position. These two English brigades, with the fifth Hanoverian,\r\nmade up the fifth division, commanded by Sir Thomas Picton. Immediately\r\nto their right, and westward of the Charleroi road, stood the third\r\ndivision, commanded by General Alten, and consisting of Ompteda's\r\nbrigade of the King's German legion, and Kielmansegge's Hanoverian\r\nbrigade. The important post of La Haye Sainte, which it will be\r\nremembered lay in front of the Duke's centre, close to the Charleroi\r\nroad, was garrisoned with troops from this division. Westward, and on\r\nthe right of Kielmansegge's Hanoverians, stood the fifth British brigade\r\nunder Halkett; and behind, Kruse's Nassau brigade was posted. On the\r\nright of Halkett's men stood the English Guards. They were in two\r\nbrigades, one commanded By Maitland, and the other by Byng. The\r\nentire division was under General Cooke. The buildings and gardens of\r\nHougoumont, which lay immediately under the height, on which stood\r\nthe British Guards, were principally manned by detachments from Byng's\r\nBrigade, aided by some brave Hanoverian riflemen, and accompanied by\r\na battalion of a Nassau regiment. On a plateau in the rear of Cooks's\r\ndivision of Guards, and inclining westward towards the village of Merk\r\nBraine, were Clinton's second infantry division, composed of Adams's\r\nthird brigade of light infantry, Du Plat's first brigade of the King's\r\nGerman legion, and third Hanoverian brigade under Colonel Halkett.\r\n\r\nThe Duke formed his second line of cavalry. This only extended behind\r\nthe right and centre of his first line. The largest mass was drawn up\r\nbehind the brigades of infantry in the centre, on either side of the\r\nCharleroi road. The brigade of household cavalry under Lord Somerset was\r\non the immediate right of the road, and on the left of it was Ponsonby's\r\nbrigade. Behind these were Trip's and Ghingy's brigades of Dutch and\r\nBelgian horse. The third Hussars of the King's German Legion were to\r\nthe right of Somerset's brigade. To the right of these, and behind\r\nMaitland's infantry, stood the third brigade under Dornberg, consisting\r\nof the 23d English Light Dragoons, and the regiments of Light Dragoons\r\nof the King's German Legion. The last cavalry on the right was Grant's\r\nbrigade, stationed in the rear of the Foot-Guards. The corps of\r\nBrunswickers, both horse and foot, and the 10th British brigade of foot,\r\nwere in reserve behind the centre and right of the entire position. The\r\nartillery was distributed at convenient intervals along the front of\r\nthe whole line. Besides the Generals who have been mentioned, Lord Hill,\r\nLord Uxbridge (who had the general command of the cavalry), the Prince\r\nof Orange, and General Chasse, were present, and acting under the Duke.\r\n\r\n[Prince Frederick's force remained at Hal, and took no part in the\r\nbattle of the 18th. The reason for this arrangement (which has been much\r\ncavilled at), may be best given in the words of Baron Muffling:--\"The\r\nDuke had retired from Quatre Bras in three columns, by three chaussees;\r\nand on the evening of the 17th, Prince Frederick of Orange was at Hal,\r\nLord Hill at Braine la Leud, and the Prince of Orange with the reserve,\r\nat Mont St. Jean. This distribution was necessary, as Napoleon could\r\ndispose of these three roads for his advance on Brussels. Napoleon on\r\nthe 17th had pressed on by Genappe as far as Rossomme. On the two other\r\nroads no enemy had yet shown himself. On the 18th the offensive was\r\ntaken by Napoleon on its greatest scale, but still the Nivelles road was\r\nnot overstepped by his left wing. These circumstances made it possible\r\nto draw Prince Frederick to the army, which would certainly have\r\nbeen done if entirely new circumstances had not arisen. The Duke had,\r\ntwenty-four hours before, pledged himself to accept a battle at Mont St.\r\nJean if Blucher would assist him there with one corps, of 25,000 men.\r\nThis being promised, the Duke was taking his measures for defence, when\r\nhe learned that, in addition to the one corps promised, Blucher was\r\nactually already on the march with his whole force, to break in by\r\nPlanchenoit on Napoleon's flank and rear. If three corps of the Prussian\r\narmy should penetrate by the unguarded plateau of Rossomme, which was\r\nnot improbable, Napoleon would be thrust from his line of retreat by\r\nGenappe, and might possibly lose even that by Nivelles. In this case\r\nPrince Frederick with his 18,000 men (who might be accounted superfluous\r\nat Mont St. Jean), might have rendered the most essential service.\"--See\r\nMuffling, p. 246 and the QUARTERLY REVIEW, No. 178. It is also worthy of\r\nobservation that Napoleon actually detached a force of 2,000 cavalry to\r\nthreaten Hal, though they returned to the main French army during the\r\nnight of the 17th. See \"Victoires at Conquetes des Francais,\" vol. xxiv.\r\np 186.]\r\n\r\nOn the opposite heights the French army was drawn up in two general\r\nlines, with the entire force of the Imperial Guards, cavalry as well as\r\ninfantry, in rear of the centre, as a reserve.\r\n\r\nThe first line of the French army was formed of the two corps commanded\r\nby Count d'Erlon and Count Reille. D'Erlon's corps was on the right,\r\nthat is, eastward of the Charleroi road, and consisted of four divisions\r\nof infantry under Generals Durette, Marcognet, Alix, and Donzelot, and\r\nof one division of light cavalry under General Jaquinot. Count Reille's\r\ncorps formed the left or western wing, and was formed of Bachelu's,\r\nFoy's, and Jerome Bonaparte's divisions of infantry, and of Pire's\r\ndivision of cavalry. The right wing of the second general French line\r\nwas formed of Milhaud's corps, consisting of two divisions of heavy\r\ncavalry. The left wing of this line was formed by Kellerman's cavalry\r\ncorps, also in two divisions. Thus each of the corps of infantry that\r\ncomposed the first line had a corps of cavalry behind it; but the\r\nsecond line consisted also of Lobau's corps of infantry, and Domont\r\nand Subervie's divisions of light cavalry; these three bodies of troops\r\nbeing drawn up on either side of La Belle Alliance, and forming the\r\ncentre of the second line. The third, or reserve line, had its centre\r\ncomposed of the infantry of the Imperial Guard. Two regiments of\r\ngrenadiers and two of chasseurs, formed the foot of the Old Guard under\r\nGeneral Friant. The Middle Guard, under Count Morand, was similarly\r\ncomposed; while two regiments of voltigeurs, and two of tirailleurs,\r\nunder Duhesme, constituted the Young Guard. The chasseurs and lancers of\r\nthe Guard were on the right of the infantry, under Lefebvre Desnouettes;\r\nand the grenadiers and dragoons of the Guards, under Guyot, were on the\r\nleft. All the French corps comprised, besides their cavalry and infantry\r\nregiments, strong batteries of horse artillery; and Napoleon's numerical\r\nsuperiority in guns was of deep importance throughout the action.\r\n\r\nBesides the leading generals who have been mentioned as commanding\r\nparticular corps, Ney and Soult were present, and acted as the Emperor's\r\nlieutenants in the battle.\r\n\r\nEnglish military critics have highly eulogised the admirable arrangement\r\nwhich Napoleon made of his forces of each arm, so as to give him the\r\nmost ample means of sustaining, by an immediate and sufficient support,\r\nany attack, from whatever point he might direct it; and of drawing\r\npromptly together a strong force, to resist any attack that might be\r\nmade on himself in any part of the field. [Siborne, vol. i. p. 376.]\r\nWhen his troops were all arrayed, he rode along the lines, receiving\r\neverywhere the most enthusiastic cheers from his men, of whose entire\r\ndevotion to him his assurance was now doubly sure. On the northern side\r\nof the valley the Duke's army was also drawn up, and ready to meet the\r\nmenaced attack.\r\n\r\nWellington had caused, on the preceding night, every brigade and corps\r\nto take up its station on or near the part of the ground which it was\r\nintended to hold in the coming battle. He had slept a few hours at his\r\nheadquarters in the village of Waterloo; and rising on the 18th, while\r\nit was yet deep night, he wrote several letters to the Governor of\r\nAntwerp, to the English Minister at Brussels, and other official\r\npersonages, in which he expressed his confidence that all would go well,\r\nbut \"as it was necessary to provide against serious losses; should any\r\naccident occur,\" he gave a series of judicious orders for what should be\r\ndone in the rear of the army, in the event of the battle going against\r\nthe Allies. He also, before he left the village of Waterloo, saw to the\r\ndistribution of the reserves of ammunition which had been parked there,\r\nso that supplies should be readily forwarded to every part of the line\r\nof battle, where they might be required, The Duke, also, personally\r\ninspected the arrangements that had been made for receiving the wounded,\r\nand providing temporary hospitals in the houses in the rear of the\r\narmy. Then, mounting a favourite charger, a small thorough-bred chestnut\r\nhorse, named \"Copenhagen,\" Wellington rode forward to the range of hills\r\nwhere his men were posted. Accompanied by his staff and by the Prussian\r\nGeneral Muffling, he rode along his lines, carefully inspecting all\r\nthe details of his position. Hougoumont was the object of his special\r\nattention. He rode down to the south-eastern extremity of its\r\nenclosures, and after having examined the nearest French troops, he made\r\nsome changes in the disposition of his own men, who were to defend that\r\nimportant post.\r\n\r\nHaving given his final orders about Hougoumont, the Duke galloped back\r\nto the high ground in the right centre of his position; and halting\r\nthere, sat watching the enemy on the opposite heights, and conversing\r\nwith his staff with that cheerful serenity which was ever his\r\ncharacteristic in the hour of battle.\r\n\r\nNot all brave men are thus gifted; and many a glance of anxious\r\nexcitement must have been cast across the valley that separated the two\r\nhosts during the protracted pause which ensued between the completion\r\nof Napoleon's preparations for attack and the actual commencement of\r\nthe contest. It was, indeed, an awful calm before the coming storm, when\r\narmed myriads stood gazing on their armed foes, scanning their number,\r\ntheir array, their probable powers of resistance and destruction, and\r\nlistening with throbbing hearts for the momentarily expected note\r\nof death; while visions of victory and glory came thronging on each\r\nsoldier's high-strung brain, not unmingled with recollections of the\r\nhome which his fall might soon leave desolate, nor without shrinking\r\nnature sometimes prompting the cold thought, that in a few moments he\r\nmight be writhing in agony, or lie a trampled and mangled mass of clay\r\non the grass now waving so freshly and purely before him.\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts WILL arise in human breasts, though the brave man soon\r\nsilences \"the child within us that trembles before death,\" [See Plato,\r\nPhaedon, c. 60; and Grote's History of Greece, vol. viii. p. 656.] and\r\nnerves himself for the coming struggle by the mental preparation which\r\nXenophon has finely called \"the soldier's arraying his own soul for\r\nbattle.\" [Hellenica, lib. vii. c. v. s. 22.] Well, too, may we hope and\r\nbelieve that many a spirit sought aid from a higher and holier source;\r\nand that many a fervent though silent prayer arose on that Sabbath morn\r\n(the battle of Waterloo was fought on a Sunday) to the Lord of Sabaoth,\r\nthe God of Battles, from the ranks, whence so many thousands were about\r\nto appear that day before his judgment-seat.\r\n\r\nNot only to those who were thus present as spectators and actors in\r\nthe dread drama, but to all Europe, the decisive contest then impending\r\nbetween the rival French and English nations, each under its chosen\r\nchief was the object of exciting interest and deepest solicitude.\r\n\"Never, indeed, had two such generals as the Duke of Wellington and the\r\nEmperor Napoleon encountered since the day when Scipio and Hannibal met\r\nat Zama.\" [See SUPRA, p. 82.]\r\n\r\nThe two great champions, who now confronted each other, were equals in\r\nyears, and each had entered the military profession at the same early\r\nage. The more conspicuous stage, on which the French general's youthful\r\ngenius was displayed, his heritage of the whole military power of the\r\nFrench Republic, the position on which for years he was elevated as\r\nsovereign head of an empire surpassing that of Charlemagne, and the\r\ndazzling results of his victories, which made and unmade kings, had\r\ngiven him a formidable pre-eminence in the eyes of mankind. Military men\r\nspoke with justly rapturous admiration of the brilliancy of his first\r\nItalian campaigns, when he broke through the pedantry of traditional\r\ntactics, and with a small but promptly-wielded force, shattered army\r\nafter army of the Austrians, conquered provinces and capitals, dictated\r\ntreaties, and annihilated or created states. The iniquity of his\r\nEgyptian expedition was too often forgotten in contemplating the\r\nskill and boldness with which he destroyed the Mameluke cavalry at the\r\nPyramids, and the Turkish infantry at Aboukir. None could forget the\r\nmarvellous passage of the Alps in 1800, or the victory of Marengo,\r\nwhich wrested Italy back from Austria, and destroyed the fruit of\r\ntwenty victories, which the enemies of France had gained over her in the\r\nabsence of her favourite chief. Even higher seemed the glories of\r\nhis German campaigns, the triumphs of Ulm, of Austerlitz, of Jena, of\r\nWagram. Napoleon's disasters in Russia, in 1812, were imputed by\r\nhis admirers to the elements; his reverses in Germany, in 1813, were\r\nattributed by them to treachery: and even those two calamitous years had\r\nbeen signalised by his victories at Borodino, at Lutzen, at Bautzen, at\r\nDresden, and at Hanau. His last campaign, in the early months of 1814,\r\nwas rightly cited as the most splendid exhibition of his military\r\ngenius, when, with a far inferior army, he long checked and frequently\r\ndefeated the vast hosts that were poured upon France. His followers\r\nfondly hoped that the campaign of 1815 would open with another \"week\r\nof miracles,\" like that which had seen his victories at Montmirail\r\nand Montereau. The laurel of Ligny was even now fresh upon his brows.\r\nBlucher had not stood before him; and who was the Adversary that now\r\nshould bar the Emperor's way?\r\n\r\nThat Adversary had already overthrown the Emperor's best generals, and\r\nthe Emperor's best armies; and, like Napoleon himself, had achieved a\r\nreputation in more than European wars. Wellington was illustrious as the\r\ndestroyer of the Mahratta power, as the liberator of Portugal and Spain,\r\nand the successful invader of Southern France. In early youth he had\r\nheld high command in India; and had displayed eminent skill in planning\r\nand combining movements, and unrivalled celerity and boldness in\r\nexecution. On his return to Europe several years passed away before any\r\nfitting opportunity was accorded for the exercise of his genius. In\r\nthis important respect, Wellington, as a subject, and Napoleon, as a\r\nsovereign, were far differently situated. At length his appointment\r\nto the command in the Spanish Peninsula gave him the means of showing\r\nEurope that England had a general who could revive the glories of Crecy,\r\nof Poictiers, of Agincourt, of Blenheim, and of Ramilies. At the head of\r\nforces always numerically far inferior to the armies with which\r\nNapoleon deluged the Peninsula;--thwarted by jealous and incompetent\r\nallies;--ill-supported by friends, and assailed by factious enemies at\r\nhome; Wellington maintained the war for several years, unstained by any\r\nserious reverse, and marked by victory in thirteen pitched battles,\r\nat Vimiera, the Douro, Talavera, Busaco, Fuentes d'Onore, Salamanca,\r\nVittoria, the Pyrenees, the Bidassoa, the Nive, the Nivelle, Orthes, and\r\nToulouse. Junot, Victor, Massena, Ney, Marmont, and Jourdain,--marshals\r\nwhose names were the terrors of continental Europe--had been baffled\r\nby his skill, and smitten down by his energy, while he liberated the\r\nkingdoms of the Peninsula from them and their Imperial master. In vain\r\ndid Napoleon at last despatch Soult, the ablest of his lieutenants,\r\nto turn the tide of Wellington's success and defend France against the\r\nEnglish invader. Wellington met Soult's manoeuvres with superior skill,\r\nand his boldness with superior vigour. When Napoleon's first abdication,\r\nin 1814, suspended hostilities, Wellington was master of the fairest\r\ndistricts of Southern France; and had under him a veteran army, with\r\nwhich (to use his own expressive phrase) \"he felt he could have gone\r\nanywhere and done anything.\" The fortune of war had hitherto kept\r\nseparate the orbits in which Napoleon and he had moved. Now, on the ever\r\nmemorable 18th of June, 1815, they met at last.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, remarkable that Napoleon, during his numerous campaigns\r\nin Spain as well as other countries, not only never encountered the Duke\r\nof Wellington before the day of Waterloo, but that he was never until\r\nthen personally engaged with British troops, except at the siege of\r\nToulon, in 1793, which was the very first incident of his military\r\ncareer. Many, however, of the French generals who were with him in 1815,\r\nknew well, by sharp experience, what English soldiers were, and what\r\nthe leader was who now headed them. Ney, Foy, and other officers who had\r\nserved in the Peninsula, warned Napoleon that he would find the English\r\ninfantry \"very devils in fight.\" The Emperor, however, persisted in\r\nemploying the old system of attack, with which the French generals\r\noften succeeded against continental troops, but which had always failed\r\nagainst the English in the Peninsula. He adhered to his usual tactics of\r\nemploying the order of the column; a mode of attack probably favoured by\r\nhim (as Sir Walter Scott remarks) on account of his faith in the extreme\r\nvalour of the French officers by whom the column was headed. It is a\r\nthreatening formation, well calculated to shake the firmness of ordinary\r\nfoes; but which, when steadily met, as the English have met it, by heavy\r\nvolleys of musketry from an extended line, followed up by a resolute\r\nbayonet charge, has always resulted in disaster to the assailants. [See\r\nespecially Sir W. Napier's glorious pictures of the battles of Busaco\r\nand Albuera. The THEORETICAL advantages of the attack in column, and\r\nits peculiar fitness for a French army, are set forth in the Chevalier\r\nFolard's \"Traite de la Colonne,\" prefixed to the first volume of his\r\n\"Polybius,\" See also the preface to his sixth volume.]\r\n\r\nIt was approaching noon before the action commenced. Napoleon, in his\r\nMemoirs, gives as the reason for this delay, the miry state of the\r\nground through the heavy rain of the preceding night and day, which\r\nrendered it impossible for cavalry or artillery to manoeuvre on it till\r\na few hours of dry weather had given it its natural consistency. It has\r\nbeen supposed, also, that he trusted to the effect which the sight of\r\nthe imposing array of his own forces was likely to produce on the part\r\nof the allied army. The Belgian regiments had been tampered with;\r\nand Napoleon had well-founded hopes of seeing them quit the Duke of\r\nWellington in a body, and range themselves under his own eagles. The\r\nDuke, however, who knew and did not trust them, had guarded against the\r\nrisk of this, by breaking up the corps of Belgians, and distributing\r\nthem in separate regiments among troops on whom he could rely. [Siborne,\r\nvol. i. p. 373.]\r\n\r\nAt last, at about half-past eleven o'clock, Napoleon began the battle by\r\ndirecting a powerful force from his left wing under his brother, Prince\r\nJerome, to attack Hougoumont. Column after column of the French now\r\ndescended from the west of the southern heights, and assailed that\r\npost with fiery valour, which was encountered with the most determined\r\nbravery. The French won the copse round the house, but a party of the\r\nBritish Guards held the house itself throughout the day. The whole of\r\nByng's brigade was required to man this hotly-contested post. Amid\r\nshell and shot, and the blazing fragments of part of the buildings,\r\nthis obstinate contest was continued. But still the English were firm in\r\nHougoumont; though the French occasionally moved forward in such numbers\r\nas enabled them to surround and mask it with part of their troops from\r\ntheir left wing, while others pressed onward up the slope, and assailed\r\nthe British right.\r\n\r\nThe cannonade, which commenced at first between the British right and\r\nthe French left, in consequence of the attack on Hougoumont, soon became\r\ngeneral along both lines; and about one o'clock, Napoleon directed a\r\ngrand attack to be made under Marshal Ney upon the centre and left wing\r\nof the allied army. For this purpose four columns of infantry, amounting\r\nto about eighteen thousand men, were collected, supported by a strong\r\ndivision of cavalry under the celebrated Kellerman; and seventy-four\r\nguns were brought forward ready to be posted on the ridge of a little\r\nundulation of the ground in the interval between the two principal\r\nchains of heights, so as to bring their fire to bear on the Duke's line\r\nat a range of about seven hundred yards. By the combined assault of\r\nthese formidable forces, led on by Ney, \"the bravest of the brave,\"\r\nNapoleon hoped to force the left centre of the British position, to take\r\nLa Haye Sainte, and then pressing forward, to occupy also the farm of\r\nMont St. Jean. He then could cut the mass of Wellington's troops off\r\nfrom their line of retreat upon Brussels, and from their own left,\r\nand also completely sever them from any Prussian troops that might be\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nThe columns destined for this great and decisive operation descended\r\nmajestically from the French line of hills, and gained the ridge of the\r\nintervening eminence, on which the batteries that supported them were\r\nnow ranged. As the columns descended again from this eminence, the\r\nseventy-four guns opened over their heads with terrible effect upon the\r\ntroops of the Allies that were stationed on the heights to the left\r\nof the Charleroi road. One of the French columns kept to the east, and\r\nattacked the extreme left of the Allies; the other three continued to\r\nmove rapidly forwards upon the left centre of the allied position. The\r\nfront line of the Allies here was composed of Bylandt's brigade of Dutch\r\nand Belgians. As the French columns moved up the southward slope of the\r\nheight on which the Dutch and Belgians stood, and the skirmishers in\r\nadvance began to open their fire, Bylandt's entire brigade turned and\r\nfled in disgraceful and disorderly panic; but there were men more worthy\r\nof the name behind.\r\n\r\nIn this part of-the second line of the Allies were posted Pack and\r\nKempt's brigades of English infantry, which had suffered severely at\r\nQuatre Bras. But Picton was here as general of division, and not even\r\nNey himself surpassed in resolute bravery that stern and fiery spirit.\r\nPicton brought his two brigades forward, side by side, in a thin,\r\ntwo-deep line. Thus joined together, they were not three thousand\r\nstrong. With these Picton had to make head against the three victorious\r\nFrench columns, upwards of four times that strength, and who, encouraged\r\nby the easy rout of the Dutch and Belgians, now came confidently over\r\nthe ridge of the hill. The British infantry stood firm; and as the\r\nFrench halted and began to deploy into line, Picton seized the critical\r\nmoment. He shouted in his stentorian voice to Kempt's brigade: \"A\r\nvolley, and then charge!\" At a distance of less than thirty yards that\r\nvolley was poured upon the devoted first sections of the nearest column;\r\nand then, with a fierce hurrah, the British dashed in with the bayonet.\r\nPicton was shot dead as he rushed forward, but his men pushed on with\r\nthe cold steel. The French reeled back in confusion. Pack's infantry had\r\nchecked the other two columns and down came a whirlwind of British horse\r\non the whole mass, sending them staggering from the crest of the hill,\r\nand cutting them down by whole battalions. Ponsonby's brigade of heavy\r\ncavalry (the Union Brigade as it was called, from its being made up of\r\nthe British Royals, the Scots Greys, and the Irish Inniskillings), did\r\nthis good service. On went the horsemen amid the wrecks of the French\r\ncolumns, capturing two eagles, and two thousand prisoners; onwards\r\nstill they galloped, and sabred the artillerymen of Ney's seventy-four\r\nadvanced guns; then severing the traces, and cutting the throats of the\r\nartillery horses, they rendered these guns totally useless to the French\r\nthroughout the remainder of the day. While thus far advanced beyond the\r\nBritish position and disordered by success, they were charged by a\r\nlarge body of French lancers, and driven back with severe loss, till\r\nVandeleur's Light horse came to their aid, and beat off the French\r\nlancers in their turn.\r\n\r\nEqually unsuccessful with the advance of the French infantry in this\r\ngrand attack, had been the efforts of the French cavalry who moved\r\nforward in support of it, along the east of the Charleroi road.\r\nSomerset's cavalry of the English Household Brigade had been launched,\r\non the right of Picton's division, against the French horse, at the same\r\ntime that the English Union Brigade of heavy horse charged the French\r\ninfantry columns on the left.\r\n\r\nSomerset's brigade was formed of the Life Guards, the Blues, and the\r\nDragoon Guards. The hostile cavalry, which Kellerman led forward,\r\nconsisted chiefly of Cuirassiers. This steel-clad mass of French\r\nhorsemen rode down some companies of German infantry, near La Haye\r\nSainte, and flushed with success, they bounded onward to the ridge of\r\nthe British position. The English Household Brigade, led on by the\r\nEarl of Uxbridge in person, spurred forward to the encounter, and in\r\nan instant, the two adverse lines of strong swordsmen, on their\r\nstrong steeds, dashed furiously together. A desperate and sanguinary\r\nhand-to-hand fight ensued, in which the physical superiority of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, guided by equal skill, and animated with equal valour,\r\nwas made decisively manifest. Back went the chosen cavalry of France;\r\nand after them, in hot pursuit, spurred the English Guards. They went\r\nforward as far and as fiercely as their comrades of the Union Brigade;\r\nand, like them, the Household cavalry suffered severely before they\r\nregained the British position, after their magnificent charge and\r\nadventurous pursuit.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's grand effort to break the English left centre had thus\r\ncompletely failed; and his right wing was seriously weakened by the\r\nheavy loss which it had sustained. Hougoumont was still being assailed,\r\nand was still successfully resisting. Troops were now beginning to\r\nappear at the edge of the horizon on Napoleon's right, which he too well\r\nknew to be Prussian, though he endeavoured to persuade his followers\r\nthat they were Grouchy's men coming to their aid.\r\n\r\nGrouchy was in fact now engaged at Wavre with his whole force, against\r\nThielmam's single Prussian corps, while the other three corps of the\r\nPrussian army were moving without opposition, save from the difficulties\r\nof the ground, upon Waterloo. Grouchy believed, on the 17th, and caused\r\nNapoleon to believe, that the Prussian army was retreating by lines of\r\nmarch remote from Waterloo upon Namur and Maestricht. Napoleon learned\r\nonly on the 18th, that there were Prussians in Wavre, and felt jealous\r\nabout the security of his own right. He accordingly, before he attacked\r\nthe English, sent Grouchy orders to engage the Prussians at Wavre\r\nwithout delay, AND TO APPROACH THE MAIN FRENCH ARMY, SO AS TO UNITE HIS\r\nCOMMUNICATIONS WITH THE EMPEROR'S. Grouchy entirely neglected this last\r\npart of his instructions; and in attacking the Prussians whom he found\r\nat Wavre, he spread his force more and more towards his right, that is\r\nto say, in the direction most remote from Napoleon. He thus knew nothing\r\nof Blucher's and Bulow's flank march upon Waterloo, till six in the\r\nevening of the 18th, when he received a note which Soult by Napoleon's\r\norders had sent off from the field of battle at Waterloo at one o'clock,\r\nto inform Grouchy that Bulow was coming over the heights of St. Lambert,\r\non the Emperor's right flank, and directing Grouchy to approach and join\r\nthe main army instantly, and crush Bulow EN FLAGRANT DELIT. It was then\r\ntoo late for Grouchy to obey; but it is remarkable that as early as noon\r\non the 18th, and while Grouchy had not proceeded as far as Wavre, he\r\nand his suite heard, the sound of heavy cannonading In the direction\r\nof Planchenoit and Mont St. Jean. General Gerard, who was with Grouchy,\r\nimplored him to march towards the cannonade, and join his operations\r\nwith those of Napoleon, who was evidently engaged with the English.\r\nGrouchy refused to do so, or even to detach part of his force in that\r\ndirection. He said that his instructions were to fight the Prussians\r\nat Wavre. He marched upon Wavre and fought for the rest of the day\r\nwith Thielman accordingly, while Blucher and Bulow were attacking the\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\n[I have heard the remark made that Grouchy twice had in his hands the\r\npower of changing the destinies of Europe, and twice wanted nerve to\r\nact: first when he flinched from landing the French army at Bantry Bay\r\nin 1796 (he was second in command to Hoche, whose ship was blown back\r\nby a storm), and secondly, when he failed to lead his whole force from\r\nWavre to the scene of decisive conflict at Waterloo. But such were the\r\narrangements of the Prussian General, that even if Grouchy had marched\r\nupon Waterloo, he would have been held in check by the nearest Prussian\r\ncorps, or certainly by the two nearest ones, while the rest proceeded\r\nto join Wellington. This, however, would have diminished the number of\r\nPrussians who appeared at Waterloo, and (what is still more important)\r\nwould have kept them back to a later hour.--See Siborne, vol i. p. 323,\r\nand Gleig, p. 142.\r\n\r\nThere are some very valuable remarks on this subject in the 70th No. of\r\nthe QUARTERLY in an article on the \"Life of Blucher,\" usually attributed\r\nto Sir Francis Head. The Prussian writer, General Clausewitz, is there\r\ncited as \"expressing a positive opinion, in which every military critic\r\nbut a Frenchman must concur, that, even had the whole of Grouchy's\r\nforce been at Napoleon's disposal, the Duke had nothing to fear pending\r\nBlucher's arrival.\r\n\r\n\"The Duke is often talked of as having exhausted his reserves in the\r\naction. This is another gross error, which Clausewitz has thoroughly\r\ndisposed of. He enumerates the tenth British Brigade, the division of\r\nChasse, and the cavalry of Collaert, as having been little or not at all\r\nengaged; and he might have also added two brigades of light cavalry.\"\r\nThe fact, also, that Wellington did not at any part of the day order up\r\nPrince Frederick's corps from Hal, is a conclusive proof that the Duke\r\nwas not so distressed as some writers have represented. Hal is not ten\r\nmiles from the field of Waterloo.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon had witnessed with bitter disappointment the rout of his\r\ntroops,--foot, horse, and artillery,--which attacked the left centre\r\nof the English, and the obstinate resistance which the garrison of\r\nHougoumont opposed to all the exertions of his left wing. He now\r\ncaused the batteries along the line of high ground held by him to be\r\nstrengthened, and for some time an unremitting and most destructive\r\ncannonade raged across the valley, to the partial cessation of other\r\nconflict. But the superior fire of the French artillery, though it\r\nweakened, could not break the British line, and more close and summary\r\nmeasures were requisite.\r\n\r\nIt was now about half-past three o'clock; and though Wellington's army\r\nhad suffered severely by the unremitting cannonade, and in the late\r\ndesperate encounter, no part of the British position had been forced.\r\nNapoleon determined therefore to try what effect he could produce on the\r\nBritish centre and right by charges of his splendid cavalry, brought on\r\nin such force that the Duke's cavalry could not check them. Fresh troops\r\nwere at the same time sent to assail La Haye Sainte and Hougoumont, the\r\npossession of these posts being the Emperor's unceasing object. Squadron\r\nafter squadron of the French cuirassiers accordingly ascended the slopes\r\non the Duke's right, and rode forward with dauntless courage against\r\nthe batteries of the British artillery in that part of the field. The\r\nartillery-men were driven from their guns, and the cuirassiers cheered\r\nloudly at their supposed triumph. But the Duke had formed his infantry\r\nin squares, and the cuirassiers charged in vain against the impenetrable\r\nhedges of bayonets, while the fire from the inner ranks of the squares\r\ntold with terrible effect on their squadrons. Time after time they rode\r\nforward with invariably the same result: and as they receded from each\r\nattack the British artillerymen rushed forward from the centres of\r\nthe squares, where they had taken refuge, and plied their guns on the\r\nretiring horsemen. Nearly the whole of Napoleon's magnificent body of\r\nheavy cavalry was destroyed in these fruitless attempts upon the British\r\nright. But in another part of the field fortune favoured him for a time.\r\nTwo French columns of infantry from Donzelot's division took La Haye\r\nSainte between six and seven o'clock, and the means were now given for\r\norganizing another formidable attack on the centre of the Allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [\"On came the whirlwind--like the last\r\n      But fiercest sweep of tempest blast--\r\n      On came the whirlwind--steel-gleams broke\r\n      Like lightning through the rolling smoke;\r\n      The war was waked anew,\r\n      Three hundred cannon-mouths roar'd loud,\r\n      And from their throats, with flash and cloud,\r\n      Their showers of iron threw.\r\n      Beneath their fire in full career,\r\n      Rush'd on the ponderous cuirassier,\r\n      The lancer couch'd his ruthless spear,\r\n      And hurrying as to havoc near,\r\n      The cohorts' eagles flew.\r\n      In one dark torrent, broad and strong,\r\n      The advancing onset roll'd along,\r\n      Forth harbinger'd by fierce acclaim,\r\n      That, from the shroud of smoke and flame,\r\n      Peal'd wildly the imperial name.\r\n\r\n     \"But on the British heart were lost\r\n      The terrors of the charging host;\r\n      For not an eye the storm that view'd\r\n      Changed its proud glance of fortitude,\r\n      Nor was one forward footstep staid,\r\n      As dropp'd the dying and the dead.\r\n      Fast as their ranks the thunders tear,\r\n      Fast they renew'd each serried square;\r\n      And on the wounded and the slain\r\n      Closed their diminish'd files again,\r\n      Till from their line scarce spears' lengths three,\r\n      Emerging from the smoke they see\r\n      Helmet, and plume, and panoply,--\r\n      Then waked their fire at once!\r\n      Each musketeer's revolving knell,\r\n      As fast, as regularly fell,\r\n      As when they practise to display\r\n      Their discipline on festal day.\r\n      Then down went helm and lance,\r\n      Down were the eagle banners sent,\r\n      Down reeling steeds and riders went,\r\n      Corslets were pierced, and pennons rent;\r\n      And, to augment the fray,\r\n      Wheeled full against their staggering flanks,\r\n      The English horsemen's foaming ranks\r\n      Forced their resistless way.\r\n      Then to the musket-knell succeeds\r\n      The clash of swords--the neigh of steeds--\r\n      As plies the smith his clanging trade,\r\n      Against the cuirass rang the blade;\r\n      And while amid their close array\r\n      The well-served cannon rent their way,\r\n      And while amid their scatter'd band\r\n      Raged the fierce rider's bloody brand,\r\n      Recoil'd in common rout and fear,\r\n      Lancer and guard and cuirassier,\r\n      Horseman and foot,--a mingled host,\r\n      Their leaders fall'n, their standards lost.\"--SCOTT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no time to be lost--Blucher and Bulow were beginning to press\r\nhard upon the French right. As early as five o'clock, Napoleon had been\r\nobliged to detach Lobau's infantry and Domont's horse to check these new\r\nenemies. They succeeded in doing so for a time; but as larger numbers\r\nof the Prussians came on the field, they turned Lobau's right flank, and\r\nsent a strong force to seize the village of Planchenoit, which, it will\r\nbe remembered, lay in the rear of the French right.\r\n\r\nThe design of the Allies was not merely to prevent Napoleon from\r\nadvancing upon Brussels, but to cut off his line of retreat and utterly\r\ndestroy his army. The defence of Planchenoit therefore became absolutely\r\nessential for the safety of the French, and Napoleon was obliged to send\r\nhis Young Guard to occupy that village, which was accordingly held\r\nby them with great gallantry against the reiterated assaults of the\r\nPrussian left, under Bulow. Three times did the Prussians fight their\r\nway into Planchenoit, and as often did the French drive them out: the\r\ncontest was maintained with the fiercest desperation on both sides,\r\nsuch being the animosity between the two nations that quarter was seldom\r\ngiven or even asked. Other Prussian forces were now appearing on the\r\nfield nearer to the English left; whom also Napoleon kept in check, by\r\ntroops detached for that purpose. Thus a large part of the French army\r\nwas now thrown back on a line at right angles with the line of that\r\nportion which still confronted and assailed the English position. But\r\nthis portion was now numerically inferior to the force under the Duke\r\nof Wellington, which Napoleon had been assailing throughout the day,\r\nwithout gaining any other advantage than the capture of La Haye Sainte.\r\nIt is true that, owing to the gross misconduct of the greater part of\r\nthe Dutch and Belgian troops, the Duke was obliged to rely exclusively\r\non his English and German soldiers, and the ranks of these had been\r\nfearfully thinned; but the survivors stood their ground heroically, and\r\nopposed a resolute front to every forward movement of their enemies.\r\n\r\nOn no point of the British line was the pressure more severe than on\r\nHalkett's brigade in the right centre which was composed of battalions\r\nof the 30th, the 33d, the 69th, and the 73d British regiments. We\r\nfortunately can quote from the journal of a brave officer of the 30th, a\r\nnarrative of what took place in this part of the field. [This excellent\r\njournal was published in the \"United Service Magazine\" during the year\r\n1852.] The late Major Macready served at Waterloo in the light company\r\nof the 30th. The extent of the peril and the carnage which Halkett's\r\nbrigade had to encounter, may be judged of by the fact that this light\r\ncompany marched into the field three officers and fifty-one men, and\r\nthat at the end of the battle they stood one officer and ten men. Major\r\nMacready's blunt soldierly account of what he actually saw and felt,\r\ngives a far better idea of the terrific scene, than can be gained from\r\nthe polished generalisations which the conventional style of history\r\nrequires, or even from the glowing stanzas of the poet. During the\r\nearlier part of the day Macready and his light company were thrown\r\nforward as skirmishers in front of the brigade; but when the French\r\ncavalry commenced their attacks on the British right centre, he and his\r\ncomrades were ordered back. The brave soldier thus himself describes\r\nwhat passed:\r\n\r\n\"Before the commencement of this attack our company and the Grenadiers\r\nof the 73d were skirmishing briskly in the low ground, covering our\r\nguns, and annoying those of the enemy. The line of tirailleurs\r\nopposed to us was not stronger than our own, but on a sudden they were\r\nreinforced by numerous bodies, and several guns began playing on us with\r\ncanister. Our poor fellows dropped very fast, and Colonel Vigoureux,\r\nRumley, and Pratt, were carried off badly wounded in about two minutes.\r\nI was now commander of our company. We stood under this hurricane of\r\nsmall shot till Halkett sent to order us in, and I brought away about a\r\nthird of the light bobs; the rest were killed or wounded, and I really\r\nwonder how one of them escaped. As our bugler was killed, I shouted\r\nand made signals to move by the left, in order to avoid the fire of our\r\nguns, and to put as good a face upon the business as possible.\r\n\r\n\"When I reached Lloyd's abandoned guns, I stood near them for about\r\na minute to contemplate the scene: it was grand beyond description.\r\nHougoumont and its wood sent up a broad flame through the dark masses\r\nof smoke that overhung the field; beneath this cloud the French were\r\nindistinctly visible. Here a waving mass of long red feathers could be\r\nseen; there, gleams as from a sheet of steel showed that the cuirassiers\r\nwere moving; 400 cannon were belching forth fire and death on every\r\nside; the roaring and shouting were indistinguishably commixed--together\r\nthey gave me an idea of a labouring volcano. Bodies of infantry and\r\ncavalry were pouring down on us, and it was time to leave contemplation,\r\nso I moved towards our columns, which were standing up in square. Our\r\nregiment and 73d formed one, and 33d and 69th another; to our right\r\nbeyond them were the Guards, and on our left the Hanoverians and German\r\nlegion of our division. As I entered the rear face of our square I\r\nhad to step over a body, and looking down, recognised Harry Beers, an\r\nofficer of our Grenadiers, who about an hour before shook hands with me,\r\nlaughing, as I left the columns. I was on the usual terms of military\r\nintimacy with poor Harry--that is to say, if either of us had died a\r\nnatural death, the other would have pitied him as a good fellow, and\r\nsmiled at his neighbour as he congratulated him on the step; but seeing\r\nhis herculean frame and animated countenance thus suddenly stiff and\r\nmotionless before me (I know not whence the feeling could originate, for\r\nI had just seen my dearest friend drop, almost with indifference), the\r\ntears started in my eyes as I sighed out, 'Poor Harry!' The tear was\r\nnot dry on my cheek when poor Harry was no longer thought of. In a few\r\nminutes after, the enemy's cavalry galloped up and crowned the crest of\r\nour position. Our guns were abandoned, and they formed between the two\r\nbrigades, about a hundred paces in our front. Their first charge was\r\nmagnificent. As soon as they quickened their trot into a gallop, the\r\ncuirassiers bent their heads so that the peaks of their helmets looked\r\nlike vizors, and they seemed cased in armour from the plume to the\r\nsaddle. Not a shot was fired till they were within thirty yards, when\r\nthe word was given, and our men fired away at them. The effect was\r\nmagical. Through the smoke we could see helmets falling, cavaliers\r\nstarting from their seats with convulsive springs as they received our\r\nballs, horses plunging and rearing in the agonies of fright and pain,\r\nand crowds of the soldiery dismounted, part of the squadron in retreat,\r\nbut the more daring remainder backing their horses to force them on\r\nour bayonets. Our fire soon disposed of these gentlemen. The main\r\nbody re-formed in our front, and rapidly and gallantly repeated their\r\nattacks, In fact, from this time (about four o'clock) till near six, we\r\nhad a constant repetition of these brave but unavailing charges. There\r\nwas no difficulty in repulsing them, but our ammunition decreased\r\nalarmingly. At length an artillery wagon galloped up, emptied two or\r\nthree casks of cartridges into the square, and we were all comfortable.\r\n\r\n\"The best cavalry is contemptible to a steady and well-supplied\r\ninfantry regiment; even our men saw this, and began to pity the useless\r\nperseverance of their assailants, and, as they advanced, would growl\r\nout, 'Here come these fools again!' One of their superior officers tried\r\na RUSE DE GUERRE, by advancing and dropping his sword, as though he\r\nsurrendered; some of us were deceived by him, but Halkett ordered the\r\nmen to fire, and he coolly retired, saluting us. Their devotion was\r\ninvincible. One officer whom we had taken prisoner was asked what force\r\nNapoleon might have in the field, and replied with a smile of mingled\r\nderision and threatening, 'Vous verrez bientot sa force, messieurs.' A\r\nprivate cuirassier was wounded and dragged into the square; his only cry\r\nwas, 'Tuez donc, tuez, tuez moi, soldats!' and as one of our men dropped\r\ndead close to him, he seized his bayonet, and forced it into his own\r\nneck; but this not despatching him, he raised up his cuirass, and\r\nplunging the bayonet into his stomach, kept working it about till he\r\nceased to breathe.\r\n\r\n\"Though we constantly thrashed our steel-clad opponents, we found more\r\ntroublesome customers in the round shot and grape, which all this time\r\nplayed on us with terrible effect, and fully avenged the cuirassiers.\r\nOften as the volleys created openings in our square would the cavalry\r\ndash on, but they were uniformly unsuccessful. A regiment on our\r\nright seemed sadly disconcerted, and at one moment was in considerable\r\nconfusion. Halkett rode out to them, and seizing their colour, waved\r\nit over his head, and restored them to something like order, though not\r\nbefore his horse was shot under him. At the height of their unsteadiness\r\nwe got the order to 'right face' to move to their assistance; some of\r\nthe men mistook it for 'right about face,' and faced accordingly, when\r\nold Major M'Laine, 73d, called out, 'No, my boys, its \"right face;\"\r\nyou'll never hear the right about as long as a French bayonet is in\r\nfront of you!' In a few moments he was mortally wounded. A regiment of\r\nlight Dragoons, by their facings either the 16th or 23d, came up to our\r\nleft and charged the cuirassiers. We cheered each other as they passed\r\nus; they did all they could, but were obliged to retire after a few\r\nminutes at the sabre. A body of Belgian cavalry advanced for the same\r\npurpose, but on passing our square, they stopped short. Our noble\r\nHalkett rode out to them and offered to charge at their head; it was of\r\nno use; the Prince of Orange came up and exhorted them to do their duty,\r\nbut in vain. They hesitated till a few shots whizzed through them, when\r\nthey turned about, and galloped like fury, or, rather, like fear. As\r\nthey passed the right face of our square the men, irritated by their\r\nrascally conduct, unanimously took up their pieces and fired a volley\r\ninto them, and 'many a good fellow was destroyed so cowardly.'\r\n\r\n\"The enemy's cavalry were by this time nearly disposed of, and as they\r\nhad discovered the inutility of their charges, they commenced annoying\r\nus by a spirited and well-directed carbine fire. While we were employed\r\nin this manner it was impossible to see farther than the columns on our\r\nright and left, but I imagine most of the army were similarly situated:\r\nall the British and Germans were doing their duty. About six o'clock\r\nI perceived some artillery trotting up our hill, which I knew by their\r\ncaps to belong to the Imperial Guard. I had hardly mentioned this to\r\na brother officer when two guns unlimbered within seventy paces of us,\r\nand, by their first discharge of grape, blew seven men into the centre\r\nof the square. They immediately reloaded, and kept up a constant and\r\ndestructive fire. It was noble to see our fellows fill up the gaps after\r\nevery discharge. I was much distressed at this moment; having ordered up\r\nthree of my light bobs, they had hardly taken their station when two\r\nof them fell horribly lacerated. One of them looked up in my face and\r\nuttered a sort of reproachful groan, and I involuntarily exclaimed, 'I\r\ncouldn't help it.' We would willingly have charged these guns, but, had\r\nwe deployed, the cavalry that flanked them would have made an example of\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"The 'vivida vis animi'--the glow which fires one upon entering into\r\naction--had ceased; it was now to be seen which side had most bottom,\r\nand would stand killing longest. The Duke visited us frequently at this\r\nmomentous period; he was coolness personified. As he crossed the rear\r\nface of our square a shell fell amongst our grenadiers, and he checked\r\nhis horse to see its effect. Some men were blown to pieces by the\r\nexplosion, and he merely stirred the rein of his charger, apparently\r\nas little concerned at their fate as at his own danger. No leader ever\r\npossessed so fully the confidence of his soldiery: wherever he appeared,\r\na murmur of 'Silence--stand to your front--here's the Duke,' was\r\nheard through the column, and then all was steady as on a parade. His\r\naides-de-camp, Colonels Canning and Gordon, fell near our square, and\r\nthe former died within it. As he came near us late in the evening,\r\nHalkett rode out to him and represented our weak state, begging his\r\nGrace to afford us a little support. 'It's impossible, Halkett,' said\r\nhe. And our general replied, 'If so, sir, you may depend on the brigade\r\nto a man!'\"\r\n\r\nAll accounts of the battle show that the Duke was ever present at each\r\nspot where danger seemed the most pressing; inspiriting his men by a few\r\nhomely and good-humoured words; and restraining their impatience to be\r\nled forward to attack in their turn.--\"Hard pounding this, gentlemen: we\r\nwill try who can pound the longest,\" was his remark to a battalion, on\r\nwhich the storm from the French guns was pouring with peculiar fury.\r\nRiding up to one of the squares, which had been dreadfully weakened, and\r\nagainst which a fresh attack of French cavalry was coming, he called to\r\nthem: \"Stand firm, my lads; what will they say of this in England?\" As\r\nhe rode along another part of the line where the men had for some time\r\nbeen falling fast beneath the enemy's cannonade, without having any\r\nclose fighting, a murmur reached his ear of natural eagerness to advance\r\nand do something more than stand still to be shot at. The Duke called to\r\nthem: \"Wait a little longer, my lads, and you shall have your wish.\" The\r\nmen were instantly satisfied and steady. It was, indeed, indispensable\r\nfor the Duke to bide his time. The premature movement of a single corps\r\ndown from the British line of heights, would have endangered the whole\r\nposition, and have probably made Waterloo a second Hastings.\r\n\r\nBut the Duke inspired all under him with his own spirit of patient\r\nfirmness. When other generals besides Halkett sent to him, begging for\r\nreinforcements, or for leave to withdraw corps which were reduced to\r\nskeletons, the answer was the same: \"It is impossible; you must hold\r\nyour ground to the last man, and all will be well.\" He gave a similar\r\nreply to some of his staff; who asked instructions from him, so that,\r\nin the event of his falling, his successor might follow out his plan. He\r\nanswered, \"My plan is simply to stand my ground here to the last man.\"\r\nHis personal danger was indeed imminent throughout the day; and though\r\nhe escaped without injury to himself or horse, one only of his numerous\r\nstaff was equally fortunate.\r\n\r\n[\"As far as the French accounts would lead us to infer, it appears that\r\nthe losses among Napoleon's staff were comparatively trifling. On this\r\nsubject perhaps the marked contrast afforded by the following anecdotes,\r\nwhich have been related to me on excellent authority, may tend to throw\r\nsome light. At one period of the battle, when the Duke was surrounded by\r\nseveral of his staff, it was very evident that the group had become the\r\nobject of the fire of a French battery. The shot fell fast about them,\r\ngenerally striking and turning up the ground on which they stood. Their\r\nhorses became restive and 'Copenhagen' himself so fidgetty, that the\r\nDuke, getting impatient, and having reasons for remaining on the\r\nspot, said to those about him, 'Gentlemen we are rather too close\r\ntogether--better to divide a little.' Subsequently, at another point of\r\nthe line, an officer of artillery came up to the Duke, and stated that\r\nhe had a distinct view of Napoleon, attended by his staff; that he had\r\nthe guns of his battery well pointed in that direction, and was prepared\r\nto fire. His Grace instantly and emphatically exclaimed, 'No! no! I'll\r\nnot allow it. It is not the business of commanders to be firing upon\r\neach other.'\"--Siborne, vol. ii. p. 263. How different is this from\r\nNapoleon's conduct at the battle of Dresden, when he personally directed\r\nthe fire of the battery which, as he thought, killed the Emperor\r\nAlexander, and actually killed Moreau.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon had stationed himself during the battle on a little hillock\r\nnear La Belle Alliance, in the centre of the French position. Here he\r\nwas seated, with a large table from the neighbouring farm-house before\r\nhim, on which maps and plans were spread; and thence with his telescope\r\nhe surveyed the various points of the field. Soult watched his orders\r\nclose at his left hand, and his staff was grouped on horseback a\r\nfew paces in the rear. [\"Souvenirs Militaires,\" par Col.\r\nLemonnier-Delafosse, p. 407. \"Ouvrard, who attended Napoleon as chief\r\ncommissary of the French army on that occasion, told me that Napoleon\r\nwas suffering from a complaint which made it very painful for him to\r\nride.\"--Lord Ellesmere, p. 47.] Here he remained till near the close\r\nof the day, preserving the appearance at least of calmness, except some\r\nexpressions of irritation which escaped him, when Ney's attack on the\r\nBritish left centre was defeated. But now that the crisis of the battle\r\nwas evidently approaching, he mounted a white Persian charger, which\r\nhe rode in action because the troops easily recognised him by the horse\r\ncolour. He had still the means of effecting a retreat. His Old Guard\r\nhad yet taken no part in the action. Under cover of it, he might have\r\nwithdrawn his shattered forces and retired upon the French frontier. But\r\nthis would only have given the English and Prussians the opportunity\r\nof completing their junction; and he knew that other armies were fast\r\ncoming up to aid them in a march upon Paris, if he should succeed in\r\navoiding an encounter with them, and retreating upon the capital. A\r\nvictory at Waterloo was his only alternative from utter ruin, and he\r\ndetermined to employ his Guard in one bold stroke more to make that\r\nvictory his own.\r\n\r\nBetween seven and eight o'clock, the infantry of the Old Guard was\r\nformed into two columns, on the declivity near La Belle Alliance. Ney\r\nwas placed at their head. Napoleon himself rode forward to a spot by\r\nwhich his veterans were to pass; and, as they approached, he raised his\r\narm, and pointed to the position of the Allies, as if to tell them\r\nthat their path lay there. They answered with loud cries of \"Vive\r\nl'Empereur!\" and descended the hill from their own side, into that\r\n\"valley of the shadow of death\" while the batteries thundered with\r\nredoubled vigour over their heads upon the British line. The line of\r\nmarch of the columns of the Guard was directed between Hougoumont and La\r\nHaye Sainte, against the British right centre; and at the same time the\r\nFrench under Donzelot, who had possession of La Haye Sainte, commenced\r\na fierce attack upon the British centre, a little more to its left. This\r\npart of the battle has drawn less attention than the celebrated attack\r\nof the Old Guard; but it formed the most perilous crisis for the allied\r\narmy; and if the Young Guard had been there to support Donzelot, instead\r\nof being engaged with the Prussians at Planchenoit, the consequences to\r\nthe Allies in that part of the field must have been most serious. The\r\nFrench tirailleurs, who were posted in clouds in La Haye Sainte, and\r\nthe sheltered spots near it, picked off the artillerymen of the English\r\nbatteries near them: and taking advantage of the disabled state of the\r\nEnglish guns, the French brought some field-pieces up to La Haye Sainte,\r\nand commenced firing grape from them on the infantry of the Allies, at\r\na distance of not more than a hundred paces. The allied infantry here\r\nconsisted of some German brigades, who were formed in squares, as it was\r\nbelieved that Donzelot had cavalry ready behind La Haye Sainte to charge\r\nthem with, if they left that order of formation. In this state the\r\nGermans remained for some time with heroic fortitude, though the\r\ngrape-shot was tearing gaps in their ranks and the side of one square\r\nwas literally blown away by one tremendous volley which the French\r\ngunners poured into it. The Prince of Orange in vain endeavoured to lead\r\nsome Nassau troops to the aid of the brave Germans. The Nassauers would\r\nnot or could not face the French; and some battalions of Brunswickers,\r\nwhom the Duke of Wellington had ordered up as a reinforcement, at first\r\nfell back, until the Duke in person rallied them, and led them on.\r\nHaving thus barred the farther advance of Donzelot, the Duke galloped\r\noff to the right to head his men who were exposed to the attack of the\r\nImperial Guard. He had saved one part of his centre from being routed;\r\nbut the French had gained ground and kept it; and the pressure on the\r\nallied line in front of La Haye Sainte was fearfully severe, until it\r\nwas relieved by the decisive success which the British in the right\r\ncentre achieved over the columns of the Guard.\r\n\r\nThe British troops on the crest of that part of the position, which the\r\nfirst column of Napoleon's Guards assailed, were Maitland's brigade of\r\nBritish Guards, having Adams's brigade (which had been brought forward\r\nduring the action) on their right. Maitland's men were lying down, in\r\norder to avoid as far as possible the destructive effect of the French\r\nartillery, which kept up an unremitting fire from the opposite heights,\r\nuntil the first column of the Imperial Guard had advanced so far up\r\nthe slope towards the British position, that any further firing of the\r\nFrench artillerymen would have endangered their own comrades. Meanwhile\r\nthe British guns were not idle; but shot and shell ploughed fast through\r\nthe ranks of the stately array of veterans that still moved imposingly\r\non. Several of the French superior officers were at its head. Ney's\r\nhorse was shot under him, but he still led the way on foot, sword in\r\nhand. The front of the massive column now was on the ridge of the hill.\r\nTo their surprise they saw no troops before them. All they could discern\r\nthrough the smoke was a small band of mounted officers. One of them was\r\nthe Duke himself. The French advanced to about fifty yards from where\r\nthe British Guards were lying down when the voice of one of the group of\r\nBritish officers was heard calling, as if to the ground before him, \"Up,\r\nGuards, and at them!\" It was the Duke who gave the order; and at the\r\nwords, as if by magic, up started before them a line of the British\r\nGuards four deep, and in the most compact and perfect order. They poured\r\nan instantaneous volley upon the head of the French column, by which\r\nno less than three hundred of those chosen veterans are said to have\r\nfallen. The French officers rushed forwards; and, conspicuous in front\r\nof their men, attempted to deploy them into a more extended line, so as\r\nto enable them to reply with effect to the British fire. But Maitland's\r\nbrigade kept showering in volley after volley with deadly rapidity. The\r\ndecimated column grew disordered in its vain efforts to expand itself\r\ninto a more efficient formation. The right word was given at the right\r\nmoment to the British for the bayonet-charge, and the brigade sprang\r\nforward with a loud cheer against their dismayed antagonists. In an\r\ninstant the compact mass of the French spread out into a rabble, and\r\nthey fled back down the hill, pursued by Maitland's men, who, however,\r\nreturned to their position in time to take part in the repulse of the\r\nsecond column of the Imperial Guard.\r\n\r\nThis column also advanced with great spirit and firmness under the\r\ncannonade which was opened on it; and passing by the eastern wall of\r\nHougoumont, diverged slightly to the right as it moved up the slope\r\ntowards the British position, so as to approach nearly the same spot\r\nwhere the first column had surmounted the height, and been defeated.\r\nThis enabled the British regiments of Adams's brigade to form a line\r\nparallel to the left flank of the French column; so that while the front\r\nof this column of French Guards had to encounter the cannonade of the\r\nBritish batteries, and the musketry of Maitlands Guards, its left flank\r\nwas assailed with a destructive fire by a four-deep body of British\r\ninfantry, extending all along it. In such a position all the bravery\r\nand skill of the French veterans were vain. The second column, like its\r\npredecessor, broke and fled, taking at first a lateral direction along\r\nthe front of the British line towards the rear of La Haye Sainte, and\r\nso becoming blended with the divisions of French infantry, which under\r\nDonzelot had been assailing the Allies so formidably in that quarter.\r\nThe sight of the Old Guard broken and in flight checked the ardour which\r\nDonzelot's troops had hitherto displayed. They, too, began to waver.\r\nAdams's victorious brigade was pressing after the flying Guard, and now\r\ncleared away the assailants of the allied centre. But the battle was\r\nnot yet won. Napoleon had still some battalions in reserve near La Belle\r\nAlliance. He was rapidly rallying the remains of the first column of his\r\nGuards, and he had collected into one body the remnants of the various\r\ncorps of cavalry, which had suffered so severely in the earlier part of\r\nthe day. The Duke instantly formed the bold resolution of now himself\r\nbecoming the assailant, and leading his successful though enfeebled army\r\nforward, while the disheartening effect of the repulse of the Imperial\r\nGuard on the rest of the French army was still strong, and before\r\nNapoleon and Ney could rally the beaten veterans themselves for another\r\nand a fiercer charge. As the close approach of the Prussians now\r\ncompletely protected the Duke's left, he had drawn some reserves of\r\nhorse from that quarter, and he had a brigade of Hussars under Vivian\r\nfresh and ready at hand. Without a moment's hesitation he launched these\r\nagainst the cavalry near La Belie Alliance. The charge was as successful\r\nas it was daring: and as there was now no hostile cavalry to check\r\nthe British infantry in a forward movement, the Duke gave the\r\nlong-wished-for command for a general advance of the army along the\r\nwhole line upon the foe. It was now past eight o'clock, and for nearly\r\nnine deadly hours had the British and German regiments stood unflinching\r\nunder the fire of artillery, the charge of cavalry, and every variety of\r\nassault, which the compact columns or the scattered tirailleurs of the\r\nenemy's infantry could inflict. As they joyously sprang forward against\r\nthe discomfited masses of the French, the setting sun broke through the\r\nclouds which had obscured the sky during the greater part of the day,\r\nand glittered on the bayonets of the Allies, while they poured down into\r\nthe valley and towards the heights that were held by the foe. The Duke\r\nhimself was among the foremost in the advance, and personally directed\r\nthe movements against each body of the French that essayed resistance.\r\nHe rode in front of Adams's brigade, cheering it forward, and even\r\ngalloped among the most advanced of the British skirmishers,\r\nspeaking joyously to the men, and receiving their hearty shouts of\r\ncongratulation. The bullets of both friends and foes were whistling fast\r\nround him; and one of the few survivors of his staff remonstrated with\r\nhim for thus exposing a life of such value. \"Never mind,\" was the Duke's\r\nanswer;--\"Never mind, let them fire away; the battle's won, and my life\r\nis of no consequence now.\" And, indeed, almost the whole of the French\r\nhost was now in irreparable confusion. The Prussian army was coming more\r\nand more rapidly forwards on their right; and the Young Guard, which\r\nhad held Planchenoit so bravely, was at last compelled to give way. Some\r\nregiments of the Old Guard in vain endeavoured to form in squares and\r\nstem the current. They were swept away, and wrecked among the waves of\r\nthe flyers. Napoleon had placed himself in one of these squares: Marshal\r\nSoult, Generals Bertrand, Drouot, Corbineau, De Flahaut, and Gourgaud,\r\nwere with him. The Emperor spoke of dying on the field, but Soult seized\r\nhis bridle and turned his charger round, exclaiming, \"Sire, are not the\r\nenemy already lucky enough?\" [Colonel Lemonnier-Delafosse, \"Memoires,\"\r\np. 388. The Colonel states that he heard these details from General\r\nGourgaud himself. The English reader will be reminded of Charles I.'s\r\nretreat from Naseby.] With the greatest difficulty, and only by the\r\nutmost exertion of the devoted officers round him, Napoleon cleared the\r\nthrong of fugitives, and escaped from the scene of the battle and the\r\nwar, which he and France had lost past all recovery. Meanwhile the Duke\r\nof Wellington still rode forward with the van of his victorious troops,\r\nuntil he reined up on the elevated ground near Rossomme. The daylight\r\nwas now entirely gone; but the young moon had risen, and the light which\r\nit cast, aided by the glare from the burning houses and other buildings\r\nin the line of the flying French and pursuing Prussians, enabled the\r\nDuke to assure himself that his victory was complete. He then rode back\r\nalong the Charleroi road toward Waterloo: and near La Belle Alliance he\r\nmet Marshal Blucher. Warm were the congratulations that were exchanged\r\nbetween the Allied Chiefs. It was arranged that the Prussians should\r\nfollow up the pursuit, and give the French no chance of rallying.\r\nAccordingly the British army, exhausted by its toils and sufferings\r\nduring that dreadful day, did not advance beyond the heights which the\r\nenemy had occupied. But the Prussians drove the fugitives before them\r\nin merciless chase throughout the night. Cannon, baggage, and all the\r\nmateriel of the army were abandoned by the French; and many thousands\r\nof the infantry threw away their arms to facilitate their escape. The\r\nground was strewn for miles with the wrecks of their host. There was no\r\nrear-guard; nor was even the semblance of order attempted, an attempt\r\nat resistance was made at the bridge and village of Genappe, the first\r\nnarrow pass through which the bulk of the French retired. The situation\r\nwas favourable; and a few resolute battalions, if ably commanded, might\r\nhave held their pursuers at bay there for some considerable time. But\r\ndespair and panic were now universal in the beaten army. At the first\r\nsound of the Prussian drums and bugles, Genappe was abandoned, and\r\nnothing thought of but headlong flight. The Prussians, under General\r\nGneisenau, still followed and still slew; nor even when the Prussian\r\ninfantry stopped in sheer exhaustion, was the pursuit given up.\r\nGneisenau still pushed on with the cavalry; and by an ingenious\r\nstratagem, made the French believe that his infantry were still close on\r\nthem, and scared them from every spot where they attempted to pause and\r\nrest. He mounted one of his drummers on a horse which had been taken\r\nfrom the captured carriage of Napoleon, and made him ride along with\r\nthe pursuing cavalry, and beat the drum whenever they came on any large\r\nnumber of the French. The French thus fled, and the Prussians pursued\r\nthrough Quatre Bras, and even over the heights of Frasne; and when at\r\nlength Gneisenau drew bridle, and halted a little beyond Frasne with the\r\nscanty remnant of keen hunters who had kept up the chace with him to\r\nthe last, the French were scattered through Gosselies, Marchiennes,\r\nand Charleroi; and were striving to regain the left bank of the river\r\nSambre, which they had crossed in such pomp and pride not a hundred\r\nhours before.\r\n\r\nPart of the French left wing endeavoured to escape from the field\r\nwithout blending with the main body of the fugitives who thronged\r\nthe Genappe causeway. A French officer, who was among those who thus\r\nretreated across the country westward of the high-road, has\r\nvividly described what he witnessed and what he suffered. Colonel\r\nLemonnier-Delafosse served in the campaign of 1815 in General Foy's\r\nstaff, and was consequently in that part of the French army at Waterloo,\r\nwhich acted against Hougoumont and the British right wing. When the\r\ncolumn of the Imperial Guard made their great charge at the end of\r\nthe day, the troops of Foy's division advanced in support of them, and\r\nColonel Lemonnier-Delafosse describes the confident hopes of victory\r\nand promotion with which he marched to that attack, and the fearful\r\ncarnage and confusion of the assailants, amid which he was helplessly\r\nhurried back by his flying comrades. He then narrates the closing scene,\r\n[Col. Lemonnier-Delafosse, \"Memoires,\" pp. 385-405. There are omissions\r\nand abridgments in the translation which I have given.]:\r\n\r\n\"Near one of the hedges of Hougoumont farm, without even a drummer to\r\nbeat the RAPPEL, we succeeded in rallying under the enemy's fire 300\r\nmen: they were nearly all that remained of our splendid division,\r\nThither came together a band of generals. There was Reille, whose horse\r\nhad been shot under him; there were D'Erlon, Bachelu, Foy, Jamin, and\r\nothers. All were gloomy and sorrowful, like vanquished men. Their words\r\nwere,--'Here is all that is left of my corps, of my division, of\r\nmy brigade. I, myself.' We had seen the fall of Duhesme, of\r\nPelet-de-Morvan, of Michel--generals who had found a glorious death. My\r\nGeneral, Foy, had his shoulder pierced through by a musket-ball: and out\r\nof his whole staff two officers only were left to him, Cahour Duhay and\r\nI. Fate had spared me in the midst of so many dangers, though the first\r\ncharger I rode had been shot and had fallen on me.\r\n\r\n\"The enemy's horse were coming down on us, and our little group was\r\nobliged to retreat. 'What had happened to our division of the left wing\r\nhad taken place all along the line. The movement of the hostile cavalry,\r\nwhich inundated the whole plain, had demoralised our soldiers, who\r\nseeing all regular retreat of the army cut off, strove each man to\r\neffect one for himself. At each instant the road became more encumbered.\r\nInfantry, cavalry, and artillery, were pressing along pell-mell: jammed\r\ntogether like a solid mass. Figure to yourself 40,000 men struggling and\r\nthrusting themselves along a single causeway. We could not take that way\r\nwithout destruction; so the generals who had collected together near the\r\nHougoumont hedge dispersed across the fields. General Foy alone remained\r\nwith the 300 men whom he had gleaned from the field of battle, and\r\nmarched at their head. Our anxiety was to withdraw from the scene of\r\naction without being confounded with the fugitives. Our general wished\r\nto retreat like a true soldier. Seeing three lights in the southern\r\nhorizon, like beacons, General Foy asked me what I thought of the\r\nposition of each. I answered, 'The first to the left is Genappe, the\r\nsecond is at Bois de Bossu, near the farm of Quatre Bras; the third is\r\nat Gosselies.' 'Let us march on the second one, then,' replied Foy, 'and\r\nlet no obstacle stop us--take the head of the column, and do not lose\r\nsight of the guiding light.' Such was his order, and I strove to obey.\r\n\r\n\"After all the agitation and the incessant din of a long day of battle,\r\nhow imposing was the stillness of that night! We proceeded on our sad\r\nand lonely march. We were a prey to the most cruel reflections, we were\r\nhumiliated, we were hopeless; but not a word of complaint was heard. We\r\nwalked silently as a troop of mourners, and it might have been said\r\nthat we were attending the funeral of our country's glory. Suddenly the\r\nstillness was broken by a challenge,--'QUI VIVE?' 'France!' 'Kellerman!'\r\n'Foy!' 'Is it you, General? come nearer to us.' At that moment we were\r\npassing over a little hillock, at the foot of which was a hut, in which\r\nKellerman and some of his officers had halted. They came out to join\r\nas Foy said to me, 'Kellerman knows the country: he has been along here\r\nbefore with his cavalry; we had better follow him.' But we found that\r\nthe direction which Kellerman chose was towards the first light, towards\r\nGenappe. That led to the causeway which our general rightly wished to\r\navoid I went to the left to reconnoitre, and was soon convinced that\r\nsuch was the case. It was then that I was able to form a full idea of\r\nthe disorder of a routed army. What a hideous spectacle! The mountain\r\ntorrent, that uproots and whirls along with it every momentary obstacle,\r\nis a feeble image of that heap of men, of horses, of equipages, rushing\r\none upon another; gathering before the least obstacle which dams up\r\ntheir way for a few seconds, only to form a mass which overthrows\r\neverything in the path which it forces for itself. Woe to him whose\r\nfooting failed him in that deluge! He was crushed, trampled to death! I\r\nreturned and told my general what I had seen, and he instantly abandoned\r\nKellerman, and resumed his original line of march.\r\n\r\n\"Keeping straight across the country over fields and the rough thickets,\r\nwe at last arrived at the Bois de Bossu, where we halted. My General\r\nsaid to me, 'Go to the farm of Quatre Bras and announce that we are\r\nhere. The Emperor or Soult must be there. Ask for orders, and recollect\r\nthat I am waiting here for you. The lives of these men depend on your\r\nexactness.' To reach the farm I was obliged to cross the high road: I\r\nwas on horseback, but nevertheless was borne away by the crowd that fled\r\nalong the road, and it was long are I could extricate myself and reach\r\nthe farmhouse. General Lobau was there with his staff, resting in\r\nfancied security. They thought that their troops had halted there; but,\r\nthough a halt had been attempted, the men had soon fled forwards, like\r\ntheir comrades of the rest of the army. The shots of the approaching\r\nPrussians were now heard; and I believe that General Lobau was taken\r\nprisoner in that farmhouse. I left him to rejoin my general, which I\r\ndid with difficulty. I found him alone. His men, as they came near the\r\ncurrent of flight, were infected with the general panic, and fled also.\r\n\r\n\"What was to be done? Follow that crowd of runaways? General Foy would\r\nnot hear of it. There were five of us still with him, all officers. He\r\nhad been wounded at about five in the afternoon, and the wound had not\r\nbeen dressed. He suffered severely; but his moral courage was unbroken.\r\n'Let us keep,' he said, 'a line parallel to the high road, and work our\r\nway hence as we best can.' A foot-track was before us, and we followed\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"The moon shone out brightly, and revealed the full wretchedness of the\r\nTABLEAU which met our eyes. A brigadier and four cavalry soldiers, whom\r\nwe met with, formed our escort. We marched on; and, as the noise grew\r\nmore distant, I thought that we were losing the parallel of the highway.\r\nFinding that we had the moon more and more on the left, I felt sure of\r\nthis, and mentioned it to the General. Absorbed in thought, he made me\r\nno reply. We came in front of a windmill, and endeavoured to procure\r\nsome information; but we could not gain an entrance, or make any one\r\nanswer, and we continued our nocturnal march. At last we entered a\r\nvillage, but found every door closed against us, and were obliged to use\r\nthreats in order to gain admission into a single house. The poor woman\r\nto whom it belonged, more dead than alive, received us as if we had been\r\nenemies. Before asking where we were, 'Food, give as some food!' was our\r\ncry. Bread and butter and beer were brought, and soon disappeared before\r\nmen who had fasted for twenty-four hours. A little revived, we ask,\r\n'Where are we? what is the name of this village?'--'Vieville.'\r\n\r\n\"On looking at the map, I saw that in coming to that village we had\r\nleaned too much to the right, and that we were in the direction of Mons.\r\nIn order to reach the Sambre at the bridge of Marchiennes, we had four\r\nleagues to traverse; and there was scarcely time to march the distance\r\nbefore daybreak. I made a villager act as our guide, and bound him by\r\nhis arm to my stirrup. He led us through Roux to Marchiennes. The\r\npoor fellow ran alongside of my horse the whole way. It was cruel, but\r\nnecessary to compel him, for we had not an instant to spare. At six in\r\nthe morning we entered Marchiennes.\r\n\r\n\"Marshal Ney was there. Our general went to see him, and to ask what\r\norders he had to give. Ney was asleep; and, rather than rob him of\r\nthe first repose he had had for four days, our General returned to us\r\nwithout seeing him. And, indeed, what orders could Marshal Ney have\r\ngiven? The whole army was crossing the Sambre, each man where and now he\r\nchose; some at Charleroi, some at Marchiennes. We were about to do the\r\nsame thing. When once beyond the Sambre we might safely halt; and both\r\nmen and horses were in extreme need of rest. We passed through Thuin;\r\nand finding a little copse near the road, we gladly sought its shelter.\r\nWhile our horses grazed, we lay down and slept. How sweet was that sleep\r\nafter the fatigues of the long day of battle, and after the night of\r\nretreat more painful still! We rested in the little copse till noon, and\r\nsate there watching the wrecks of our army defile along the road before\r\nus. It was a soul-harrowing sight! Yet the different arms of the service\r\nhad resumed a certain degree of order amid their disorder; and our\r\nGeneral, feeling his strength revive, resolved to follow a strong\r\ncolumn of cavalry which was taking the direction of Beaumont, about four\r\nleagues off. We drew near Beaumont, when suddenly a regiment of horse\r\nwas seen debouching from a wood on our left. The column that we followed\r\nshouted out, 'The Prussians! the Prussians!' and galloped off in utter\r\ndisorder. The troops that thus alarmed them were not a tenth part of\r\ntheir number, and were in reality our own 8th Hussars, who wore\r\ngreen uniforms. But the panic had been brought even thus far from the\r\nbattle-field, and the disorganized column galloped into Beaumont, which\r\nwas already crowded with our infantry. We were obliged to follow that\r\nDEBACLE. On entering Beaumont we chose a house of superior appearance,\r\nand demanded of the mistress of it refreshments for the General. 'Alas!'\r\nsaid the lady, 'this is the tenth General who has been to this house\r\nsince this morning. I have nothing left. Search, if you please, and\r\nsee.' Though unable to find food for the General, I persuaded him to\r\ntake his coat off and let me examine his wound. The bullet had gone\r\nthrough the twists of the left epaulette, and penetrating the skin, had\r\nrun round the shoulder without injuring the bone. The lady of the house\r\nmade some lint for me; and without any great degree of surgical skill I\r\nsucceeded in dressing the wound.\r\n\r\n\"Being still anxious to procure some food for the General and\r\nourselves, if it were but a loaf of ammunition bread, I left the house\r\nand rode out into the town. I saw pillage going on in every direction:\r\nopen caissons, stripped and half-broken, blocked up the streets. The\r\npavement was covered with plundered and torn baggage. Pillagers and\r\nrunaways, such were all the comrades I met with. Disgusted at them, I\r\nstrove, sword in hand, to stop one of the plunderers; but, more active\r\nthan I, he gave me a bayonet stab in my left arm, in which I fortunately\r\ncaught his thrust, which had been aimed full at my body. He disappeared\r\namong the crowd, through which I could not force my horse. My spirit of\r\ndiscipline had made me forget that in such circumstances the soldier is\r\na mere wild beast. But to be wounded by a fellow-countryman after\r\nhaving passed unharmed through all the perils of Quatre Bras and\r\nWaterloo!--this did seem hard, indeed. I was trying to return to General\r\nFoy, when another horde of flyers burst into Beaumont, swept me into the\r\ncurrent of their flight, and hurried me out of the town with them. Until\r\nI received my wound I had preserved my moral courage in full force; but\r\nnow, worn out with fatigue, covered with blood, and suffering\r\nsevere pain from the wound, I own that I gave way to the general\r\ndemoralisation, and let myself be inertly borne along with the rushing\r\nmass. At last I reached Landrecies, though I know not how or when. But\r\nI found there our Colonel Hurday, who had been left behind there in\r\nconsequence of an accidental injury from a carriage. He took me with\r\nhim to Paris, where I retired amid my family, and got cured of my wound,\r\nknowing nothing of the rest of political and military events that were\r\ntaking place.\"\r\n\r\nNo returns ever were made of the amount of the French loss in the battle\r\nof Waterloo; but it must have been immense, and may be partially judged\r\nof by the amount of killed and wounded in the armies of the conquerors.\r\nOn this subject both the Prussian and British official evidence is\r\nunquestionably full and authentic. The figures are terribly emphatic.\r\n\r\nOf the army that fought under the Duke of Wellington nearly 15,000 men\r\nwere killed and wounded on this single day of battle. Seven thousand\r\nPrussians also fell at Waterloo. At such a fearful price was the\r\ndeliverance of Europe purchased.\r\n\r\nBy none was the severity of that loss more keenly felt than by our great\r\ndeliverer himself. As may be seen in Major Macready's narrative, the\r\nDuke, while the battle was raging, betrayed no sign of emotion at\r\nthe most ghastly casualties; but, when all was over, the sight of the\r\ncarnage with which the field was covered, and still more, the sickening\r\nspectacle of the agonies of the wounded men who lay moaning in their\r\nmisery by thousands and tens of thousands, weighed heavily on the spirit\r\nof the victor, as he rode back across the scene of strife. On reaching\r\nhis head-quarters in the village of Waterloo, the Duke inquired\r\nanxiously after the numerous friends who had been round him in the\r\nmorning, and to whom he was warmly attached. Many he was told were dead;\r\nothers were lying alive, but mangled and suffering, in the houses\r\nround him. It is in our hero's own words alone that his feelings can be\r\nadequately told. In a letter written by him almost immediately after his\r\nreturn from the field, he thus expressed himself:--\"My heart is broken\r\nby the terrible loss I have sustained in my old friends and companions,\r\nand my poor soldiers. Believe me, nothing except a battle lost, can\r\nbe half so melancholy as a battle won; the bravery of my troops has\r\nhitherto saved me from the greater evil; but to win such a battle as\r\nthis of Waterloo, at the expense of so many gallant friends, could only\r\nbe termed a heavy misfortune but for the result to the public.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not often that a successful General in modern warfare is called\r\non, like the victorious commander of the ancient Greek armies, to award\r\na prize of superior valour to one of his soldiers. Such was to some\r\nextent the case with respect to the battle of Waterloo. In the August\r\nof 1818, an English clergyman offered to confer a small annuity on some\r\nWaterloo soldier, to be named by the Duke. [Siborne, vol. i. p. 391.]\r\nThe Duke requested Sir John Byng to choose a man from the 2d Brigade\r\nof Guards, which had so highly distinguished itself in the defence of\r\nHougoumont. There were many gallant candidates, but the election fell\r\non Sergeant James Graham, of the light company of the Coldstreams. This\r\nbrave man had signalised himself, throughout the day, in the defence of\r\nthat important post, and especially in the critical struggle that\r\ntook place at the period when the French, who had gained the wood, the\r\norchard, and detached garden, succeeded in bursting open a gate of\r\nthe courtyard of the chateau itself, and rushed in in large masses,\r\nconfident of carrying all before them. A hand-to-hand fight, of the most\r\ndesperate character, was kept up between them and the Guards for a few\r\nminutes; but at last the British bayonets prevailed. Nearly all the\r\nFrenchmen who had forced their way in were killed on the spot; and,\r\nas the few survivors ran back, five of the Guards, Colonel Macdonnell,\r\nCaptain Wyndham, Ensign Gooch, Ensign Hervey, and Sergeant Graham, by\r\nsheer strength, closed the gate again, in spite of the efforts of the\r\nFrench from without, and effectually barricaded it against further\r\nassaults. Over and through the loopholed wall of the courtyard, the\r\nEnglish garrison now kept up a deadly fire of musketry, which was\r\nfiercely answered by the French, who swarmed round the curtilage like\r\nravening wolves. Shells, too, from their batteries, were falling fast\r\ninto the besieged place, one of which set part of the mansion and some\r\nof the out-buildings on fire. Graham, who was at this time standing\r\nnear Colonel Macdonnell at the wall, and who had shown the most perfect\r\nsteadiness and courage, now asked permission of his commanding officer\r\nto retire for a moment. Macdonnell replied, \"By all means, Graham; but\r\nI wonder you should ask leave now.\" Graham answered, \"I would not, sir,\r\nonly my brother is wounded, and he is in that out-building there, which\r\nhas just caught fire.\" Laying down his musket, Graham ran to the blazing\r\nspot, lifted up his brother, and laid him in a ditch. Then he was back\r\nat his post, and was plying his musket against the French again, before\r\nhis absence was noticed, except by his colonel.\r\n\r\nMany anecdotes of individual prowess have been preserved: but of all\r\nthe brave men who were in the British army on that eventful day, none\r\ndeserve more honour for courage and indomitable resolution than Sir\r\nThomas Picton, who, as has been mentioned, fell in repulsing the great\r\nattack of the French upon the British left centre. It was not until the\r\ndead body was examined after the battle, that the full heroism of Picton\r\nwas discerned. He had been wounded on the 16th, at Quatre Bras, by a\r\nmusket-ball, which had broken two of his ribs, and caused also severe\r\ninternal injuries; but he had concealed the circumstance, evidently in\r\nexpectation that another and greater battle would be fought in a short\r\ntime, and desirous to avoid being solicited to absent himself from the\r\nfield. His body was blackened and swollen by the wound, which must have\r\ncaused severe and incessant pain; and it was marvellous how his spirit\r\nhad borne him up, and enabled him to take part in the fatigues and\r\nduties of the field. The bullet which, on the 18th, killed the renowned\r\nloader of \"the fighting Division\" of the Peninsula, entered the head\r\nnear the left temple, and passed through the brain; so that Picton's\r\ndeath must have been instantaneous.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting narratives of personal adventure at\r\nWaterloo, is that of Colonel Frederick Ponsonby, of the 12th Light\r\nDragoons, who was severely wounded when Vandeleur's brigade, to which he\r\nbelonged, attacked the French lancers, in order to bring off the Union\r\nBrigade, which was retiring from its memorable charge. [See p. 361,\r\nSUPRA.] The 12th, like those whom they rescued, advanced much further\r\nagainst the French position than prudence warranted. Ponsonby, with many\r\nothers, was speared by a reserve of Polish lancers, and left for dead\r\non the field. It is well to refer to the description of what he suffered\r\n(as he afterwards gave it, when almost miraculously recovered from his\r\nnumerous wounds), because his fate, or worse, was the fate of thousands\r\nmore; and because the narrative of the pangs of an individual, with whom\r\nwe can identify ourselves, always comes more home to us than a general\r\ndescription of the miseries of whole masses. His tale may make us\r\nremember what are the horrors of war as well as its glories. It is to\r\nbe remembered that the operations which he refers to, took place about\r\nthree o'clock in the day, and that the fighting went on for at least\r\nfive hours more. After describing how he and his men charged through the\r\nFrench whom they first encountered, and went against other enemies, he\r\nstates:--\r\n\r\n\"We had no sooner passed them than we were ourselves attacked before\r\nwe could form, by about 300 Polish lancers, who had hastened to their\r\nrelief; the French artillery pouring in among us a heavy fire of grape,\r\nthough for one of our men they killed three of their own.\r\n\r\n\"In the MELEE I was almost instantly disabled in both arms, losing\r\nfirst my sword, and then my reins, and followed by a few men, who were\r\npresently cut down, no quarter being allowed, asked or given, I was\r\ncarried along by my horse, till, receiving a blow from a sabre, I fell\r\nsenseless on my face to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Recovering, I raised myself a little to look round, being at that time,\r\nI believe, in a condition to get up and run away; when a lancer passing\r\nby, cried out, 'Tu n'est pas mort, coquin!' and struck his lance through\r\nmy back. My head dropped, the blood gushed into my mouth, a difficulty\r\nof breathing came on, and I thought all was over.\r\n\r\n\"Not long afterwards (it was impossible to measure time, but I must have\r\nfallen in less than ten minutes after the onset), a tirailleur\r\nstopped to plunder me, threatening my life. I directed him to a\r\nsmall side-pocket, in which he found three dollars, all I had; but\r\nhe continued to threaten, and I said he might search me: this he did\r\nimmediately, unloosing my stock and tearing open my waistcoat, and\r\nleaving me in a very uneasy posture.\r\n\r\n\"But he was no sooner gone, than an officer bringing up some troops,\r\nto which probably the tirailleur belonged and happening to halt where\r\nI lay, stooped down and addressed me, saying, he feared I was badly\r\nwounded; I said that I was, and expressed a wish to be removed to the\r\nrear. He said it was against their orders to remove even their own men;\r\nbut that if they gained the day (and he understood that the Duke of\r\nWellington was killed, and that some of our battalions had surrendered),\r\nevery attention in his power would be shown me. I complained of thirst,\r\nand he held his brandy-bottle to my lips, directing one of the soldiers\r\nto lay me straight on my side, and place a knapsack under my head. He\r\nthen passed on into action--soon, perhaps, to want, though not receive,\r\nthe same assistance; and I shall never know to whose generosity I was\r\nindebted, as I believe, for my life. Of what rank he was, I cannot say:\r\nhe wore a great coat. By-and-by another tirailleur came up, a fine\r\nyoung man, full of ardour. He knelt down and fired over me, loading and\r\nfiring many times, and conversing with me all the while.\" The Frenchman,\r\nwith strange coolness, informed Ponsonby of how he was shooting, and\r\nwhat he thought of the progress of the battle. \"At last he ran off,\r\nexclaiming, 'You will probably not be sorry to hear that we are going\r\nto retreat. Good day, my friend.' It was dusk,\" Ponsonby adds, \"when two\r\nsquadrons of Prussian cavalry, each of them two deep, came across the\r\nvalley, and passed over me in full trot, lifting me from the ground,\r\nand tumbling me about cruelly. The clatter of of their approach and the\r\napprehensions they excited, may be imagined; a gun taking that direction\r\nmust have destroyed me.\r\n\r\n\"The battle was now at an end, or removed to a distance. The shouts,\r\nthe imprecations, the outcries of 'Vive l'Empereur!' the discharge of\r\nmusketry and cannon, were over; and the groans of the wounded all around\r\nme, became every moment more and more audible. I thought the night would\r\nnever end.\r\n\r\n\"Much about this time I found a soldier of the Royals lying across my\r\nlegs: he had probably crawled thither in his agony; and his weight, his\r\nconvulsive motions, and the air issuing through a wound in his side,\r\ndistressed me greatly; the last circumstance most of all, as I had\r\na wound of the same nature myself. It was not a dark night, and the\r\nPrussians were wandering about to plunder; the scene in Ferdinand Count\r\nFathom came into my mind, though no women appeared. Several stragglers\r\nlooked at me, as they passed by, one after another, and at last one of\r\nthem stopped to examine me. I told him as well as I could, for I spoke\r\nGerman very imperfectly, that I was a British officer, and had been\r\nplundered already; he did not desist, however, and pulled me about\r\nroughly.\r\n\r\n\"An hour before midnight I saw a man in an English uniform walking\r\ntowards me. He was, I suspect, on the same errand, and he came and\r\nlooked in my face. I spoke instantly, telling him who I was, and\r\nassuring him of a reward if he would remain by me. He said he belonged\r\nto the 40th, and had missed his regiment; he released me from the dying\r\nsoldier, and being unarmed, took up a sword from the ground, and stood\r\nover me, pacing backwards and forwards.\r\n\r\n\"Day broke; and at six o'clock in the morning some English were seen at\r\na distance, and he ran to them. A messenger being sent off to Hervey, a\r\ncart came for me, and I was placed in it, and carried to the village\r\nof Waterloo, a mile and a half off, and laid in the bed from which as I\r\nunderstood afterwards, Gordon had been just carried out. I had received\r\nseven wounds; a surgeon slept in my room, and I was saved by excessive\r\nbleeding.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Macready, in the journal already cited, [See SUPRA. p. 368.]\r\njustly praises the deep devotion to their Emperor which, marked the\r\nFrench at Waterloo. Never, indeed, had the national bravery of the\r\nFrench people been more nobly shown. One soldier in the French ranks was\r\nseen, when his arm was shattered by a cannon-ball, to wrench it off with\r\nthe other; and throwing it up in the air, he exclaimed to his comrades,\r\n\"Vive l'Empereur jusqu'a la mort!\" Colonel Lemonnier-Delafosse mentions\r\nin his Memoirs, [Page 388.] that at the beginning of the action, a\r\nFrench soldier who had had both legs carried off by a cannon-ball,\r\nwas borne past the front of Foy's division, and called out to them, \"Ca\r\nn'est rien, camarades; Vive l'Empereur! Gloire a la France!\" The same\r\nofficer, at the end of the battle, when all hope was lost, tells us that\r\nhe saw a French grenadier, blackened with powder, and with his clothes\r\ntorn and stained, leaning on his musket, and immoveable as a statue.\r\nThe colonel called to him to join his comrades and retreat; but the\r\ngrenadier showed him his musket and his hands; and said, \"These\r\nhands have with this musket used to-day more than twenty packets of\r\ncartridges: it was more than my share: I supplied myself with ammunition\r\nfrom the dead. Leave me to die here on the field of battle. It is not\r\ncourage that fails me, but strength.\" Then, as Colonel Delafosse left\r\nhim, the soldier stretched himself on the ground to meet his fate,\r\nexclaiming, \"Tout est perdu! pauvre France!\" The gallantry of the French\r\nofficers at least equalled that of their men. Ney, in particular, set\r\nthe example of the most daring courage. Here, as in every French army\r\nin which he ever served or commanded, he was \"le brave des braves.\"\r\nThroughout the day he was in the front of the battle; and was one of the\r\nvery last Frenchmen who quitted the field. His horse was killed under\r\nhim in the last attack made on the English position; but he was seen\r\non foot, his clothes torn with bullets, his face smirched with powder,\r\nstriving, sword in hand, first to urge his men forward, and at last to\r\ncheck their flight.\r\n\r\nThere was another brave general of the French army, whose valour and\r\ngood conduct on that day of disaster to his nation should never be\r\nunnoticed when the story of Waterloo is recounted. This was General\r\nPolet, who, about seven in the evening, led the first battalion of the\r\n2d regiment of the Chasseurs of the Guard to the defence of Planchenoit;\r\nand on whom Napoleon personally urged the deep importance of maintaining\r\npossession of that village. Pelet and his men took their post in the\r\ncentral part of the village, and occupied the church and churchyard in\r\ngreat strength. There they repelled every assault of the Prussians,\r\nwho in rapidly increasing numbers rushed forward with infuriated\r\npertinacity. They held their post till the utter rout of the main army\r\nof their comrades was apparent, and the victorious Allies were thronging\r\naround Planchenoit. When Pelet and his brave chasseurs quitted the\r\nchurchyard, and retired with steady march, though they suffered\r\nfearfully from the moment they left their shelter, and Prussian cavalry\r\nas well as infantry dashed fiercely after them. Pelet kept together a\r\nlittle knot of 250 veterans, and had the eagle covered over, and borne\r\nalong in the midst of them. At one time the inequality of the ground\r\ncaused his ranks to open a little; and in an instant the Prussian\r\nhorseman were on them, and striving to capture the eagle. Captain\r\nSiborne relates the conduct of Pelet with the admiration worthy of one\r\nbrave soldier for another:--\r\n\r\n\"Pelet, taking advantage of a spot of ground which afforded them some\r\ndegree of cover against the fire of grape by which they were constantly\r\nassailed, halted the standard-bearer, and called out, \"A moi chasseurs!\r\nsauvons l'aigle ou mourons autour d'elle!\" The chasseurs immediately\r\npressed around him, forming what is usually termed the rallying square,\r\nand, lowering their bayonets, succeeded in repulsing the charge of\r\ncavalry. Some guns were then brought to bear upon them, and subsequently\r\na brisk fire of musketry; but notwithstanding the awful sacrifice which\r\nwas thus offered up in defence of their precious charge, they succeeded\r\nin reaching the main line of retreat, favoured by the universal\r\nconfusion, as also by the general obscurity which now prevailed; and\r\nthus saved alike the eagle and the honour of the regiment.\"\r\n\r\nFrench writers do injustice to their own army and general, when they\r\nrevive malignant calumnies against Wellington, and speak of his having\r\nblundered into victory. No blunderer could have successfully encountered\r\nsuch troops as those of Napoleon, and under such a leader. It is\r\nsuperfluous to cite against these cavils the testimony which other\r\ncontinental critics have borne to the high military genius of our\r\nillustrious chief. I refer to one only, which is of peculiar value, on\r\naccount of the quarter whence it comes. It is that of the great German\r\nwriter Niebuhr, whose accurate acquaintance with every important scene\r\nof modern as well as ancient history was unparalleled: and who was no\r\nmere pedant, but a man practically versed in active life, and had been\r\npersonally acquainted with most of the leading men in the great events\r\nof the early part of this century. Niebuhr, in the passage which I\r\nallude to, [Roman History, vol. v. p. 17.] after referring to the\r\nmilitary \"blunders\" of Mithridates, Frederick the Great, Napoleon,\r\nPyrrhus, and Hannibal, uses these remarkable words, \"The Duke of\r\nWellington is, I believe, the only general in whose conduct of war we\r\ncannot discover any important mistake.\" Not that it is to be supposed\r\nthat the Duke's merits were simply of a negative order, or that he was\r\nmerely a cautious, phlegmatic general fit only for defensive warfare,\r\nas some recent French historians have described him. On the contrary,\r\nhe was bold even to audacity when boldness was required. \"The intrepid\r\nadvance and fight at Assaye, the crossing of the Douro, and the movement\r\non Talavera in 1809, the advance to Madrid and Burgos in 1812, the\r\nactions before Bayonne in 1813, and the desperate stand made at Waterloo\r\nitself, when more tamely-prudent generals would have retreated beyond\r\nBrussels, place this beyond a doubt.\" [See the admirable parallel of\r\nWellington and Marlborough at the end of Sir Archibald Alison's \"Life of\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough.\" Sir Archibald justly considers Wellington the\r\nmore daring general of the two.]\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the French military power at Waterloo was so complete,\r\nthat the subsequent events of the brief campaign have little interest.\r\nLamartine truly says: \"This defeat left nothing undecided in future\r\nevents, for victory had given judgment. The war began and ended in a\r\nsingle battle.\" Napoleon himself recognised instantly and fully the\r\ndeadly nature of the blow which had been dealt to his empire. In his\r\nflight from the battle-field he first halted at Charleroi, but the\r\napproach of the pursuing Prussians drove him thence before he had rested\r\nthere an hour. With difficulty getting clear of the wrecks of his own\r\narmy, he reached Philippeville, where he remained a few hours, and sent\r\norders to the French generals in the various extremities of France to\r\nconverge with their troops upon Paris. He ordered Soult to collect\r\nthe fugitives of his own force, and lead them to Laon. He then hurried\r\nforward to Paris, and reached his capital before the news of his own\r\ndefeat. But the stern truth soon transpired. At the demand of the\r\nChambers of Peers and Representatives, he abandoned the throne by a\r\nsecond and final abdication on the 22d of June. On the 29th of June he\r\nleft the neighbourhood of Paris, and proceeded to Rochefort in the hope\r\nof escaping to America; but the coast was strictly watched, and on the\r\n15th of July the ex-emperor surrendered himself on board of the English\r\nman-of-war the Bellerophon.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the allied armies had advanced steadily upon Paris, driving\r\nbefore them Grouchy's corps, and the scanty force which Soult had\r\nsucceeded in rallying at Laon. Cambray, Peronne, and other fortresses\r\nwere speedily captured; and by the 29th of June the invaders were taking\r\ntheir positions in front of Paris. The Provisional Government, which\r\nacted in the French capital after the Emperor's abdication, opened\r\nnegotiations with the allied chiefs. Blucher, in his quenchless hatred\r\nof the French, was eager to reject all proposals for a suspension of\r\nhostilities, and to assault and storm the city. But the sager and\r\ncalmer spirit of Wellington prevailed over his colleague; the entreated\r\narmistice was granted; and on the 3d of July the capitulation of Paris\r\nterminated the War of the Battle of Waterloo.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn closing our observations on this the last of the Decisive Battles of\r\nthe World, it is pleasing to contrast the year which it signalized with\r\nthe year that is now [Written in June 1851.] passing over our heads. We\r\nhave not (and long may we be without) the stern excitement of martial\r\nstrife, and we see no captive standards of our European neighbours\r\nbrought in triumph to our shrines. But we behold an infinitely prouder\r\nspectacle. We see the banners of every civilized nation waving over the\r\narena of our competition with each other, in the arts that minister\r\nto our race's support and happiness, and not to its suffering and\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n     \"Peace hath her victories\r\n      No less renowned than War;\"\r\n\r\nand no battle-field ever witnessed a victory more noble than that which\r\nEngland, under her Sovereign Lady and her Royal Prince, is now teaching\r\nthe peoples of the earth to achieve over selfish prejudices and\r\ninternational feuds, in the great cause of the general promotion of the\r\nindustry and welfare of mankind.",
