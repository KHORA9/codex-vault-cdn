Thence, by\r\ninevitable sequence, issued the independence of the United States. The\r\ncontest, thus completed, covered forty-three years.\r\n\r\nThe four seniors of our series, Hawke, Rodney, Howe, and Jervis,\r\nwitnessed the whole of this momentous period, and served conspicuously,\r\nsome more, some less, according to their age and rank, during its\r\nvarious stages. Hawke, indeed, was at the time of the American\r\nRevolution too old to go to sea, but he did not die until October 16,\r\n1781, three days before the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, which\r\nis commonly accepted as the closing incident of our struggle for\r\nindependence. On the other hand, the two younger men, Saumarez and\r\nPellew, though they had entered the navy before the American Revolution,\r\nsaw in it the beginnings of an active service which lasted to the end of\r\nthe Napoleonic wars, the most continuous and gigantic strife of modern\r\ntimes. It was as the enemies of our cause that they first saw gunpowder\r\nburned in anger.\r\n\r\nNor was it only amid the commonplaces of naval warfare that they then\r\ngained their early experiences in America. Pellew in 1776, on Lake\r\nChamplain, bore a brilliant part in one of the most decisive--though\r\namong the least noted--campaigns of the Revolutionary contest; and a\r\nyear later, as leader of a small contingent of seamen, he shared the\r\nfate of Burgoyne's army at Saratoga. In 1776 also, Saumarez had his part\r\nin an engagement which ranks among the bloodiest recorded between ships\r\nand forts, being on board the British flag-ship Bristol at the attack\r\nupon Fort Moultrie, the naval analogue of Bunker Hill; for, in the one\r\nof these actions as in the other, the great military lesson was the\r\nresistant power against frontal attack of resolute marksmen, though\r\nuntrained to war, when fighting behind entrenchments,--a teaching\r\nrenewed at New Orleans, and emphasized in the recent South African War.\r\nThe well-earned honors of the comparatively raw colonials received\r\ngenerous recognition at the time from their opponents, even in the midst\r\nof the bitterness proverbially attendant upon family quarrels; but it is\r\nonly just to allow that their endurance found its counterpart in the\r\nresolute and persistent valor of the assailants. In these two battles,\r\nwith which the War of Independence may be said fairly to have begun, by\r\nland and by water, in the far North and in the far South, the men of the\r\nsame stock, whose ancestors there met face to face as foes, have now in\r\npeace a common heritage of glory. If little of bitterness remains in the\r\nrecollections which those who are now fellow-citizens retain of the\r\nstruggle between the North and the South, within the American Republic,\r\nwe of two different nations, who yet share a common tongue and a common\r\ntradition of liberty and law, may well forget the wrongs of the earlier\r\nstrife, and look only to the common steadfast courage with which each\r\nside then bore its share in a civil conflict.\r\n\r\nThe professional lives of these men, therefore, touch history in many\r\npoints; not merely history generally, but American history specifically.\r\nNor is this contact professional only, devoid of personal tinge. Hawke\r\nwas closely connected by blood with the Maryland family of Bladen; that\r\nhaving been his mother's maiden name, and Governor Bladen of the then\r\ncolony being his first cousin. Very much of his early life was spent\r\nupon the American Station, largely in Boston. But those were the days of\r\nWalpole's peace policy; and when the maritime war, which the national\r\noutcry at last compelled, attained large dimensions, Hawke's already\r\ndemonstrated eminence as a naval leader naturally led to his employment\r\nin European waters, where the more immediate dangers, if not the\r\ngreatest interests, of Great Britain were then felt to be. The universal\r\ncharacter, as well as the decisive issues of the opening struggle were\r\nas yet but dimly foreseen. Rodney also had family ties with America,\r\nthough somewhat more remote. Cæsar Rodney, a signer of the Declaration\r\nof Independence from Delaware, was of the same stock; their\r\ngreat-grandfathers were brothers. It was from the marriage of his\r\nancestor with the daughter of a Sir Thomas Cæsar that the American\r\nRodney derived his otherwise singular name.\r\n\r\nHowe, as far as known, had no relations on this side of the water; but\r\nhis elder brother, whom he succeeded in the title, was of all British\r\nofficers the one who most won from the colonial troops with whom he was\r\nassociated a personal affection, the memory of which has been\r\ntransmitted to us; while the admiral's own kindly attitude towards the\r\ncolonists, and his intimacy with Franklin, no less than his professional\r\nability, led to his being selected for the North American command at the\r\ntime when the home country had not yet lost all hope of a peaceable\r\nsolution of difficulties. To this the Howe tradition was doubtless\r\nexpected to contribute. Jervis, a man considerably younger than the\r\nother three, by the accidents of his career came little into touch with\r\neither the colonies or the colonists, whether before or during the\r\nRevolutionary epoch; yet even he, by his intimate friendship with Wolfe,\r\nand intercourse with his last days, is brought into close relation with\r\nan event and a name indelibly associated with one of the great\r\nlandmarks--crises--in the history of the American Continent. Although\r\nthe issue of the strife depended, doubtless, upon deeper and more\r\nfar-reaching considerations, it is not too much to say that in the\r\nheights of Quebec, and in the name of Wolfe, is signalized the downfall\r\nof the French power in America. There was prefigured the ultimate\r\npredominance of the traditions of the English-speaking races throughout\r\nthis continent, which in our own momentous period stands mediator\r\nbetween the two ancient and contrasted civilizations of Europe and Asia,\r\nthat so long moved apart, but are now brought into close, if not\r\nthreatening, contact.\r\n\r\nInteresting, however, as are the historical and social environments in\r\nwhich their personalities played their part, it is as individual men,\r\nand as conspicuous exemplars--types--of the varied characteristics which\r\ngo to the completeness of an adequate naval organization, that they are\r\nhere brought forward. Like other professions,--and especially like its\r\nsister service, the Army,--the Navy tends to, and for efficiency\r\nrequires, specialization. Specialization, in turn, results most\r\nsatisfactorily from the free play of natural aptitudes; for aptitudes,\r\nwhen strongly developed, find expression in inclination, and readily\r\nseek their proper function in the body organic to which they belong.\r\nEach of these distinguished officers, from this point of view, does not\r\nstand for himself alone, but is an eminent exponent of a class; while\r\nthe class itself forms a member of a body which has many organs, no one\r\nof which is independent of the other, but all contributive to the body's\r\nwelfare. Hence, while the effort has been made to present each in his\r\nfull individuality, with copious recourse to anecdote and illustrative\r\nincident as far as available, both as a matter of general interest and\r\nfor accurate portrayal, special care has been added to bring out\r\noccurrences and actions which convey the impression of that natural\r\ncharacter which led the man to take the place he did in the naval body,\r\nto develop the professional function with which he is more particularly\r\nidentified; for personality underlies official character.\r\n\r\nIn this sense of the word, types are permanent; for such are not the\r\nexclusive possession of any age or of any service, but are found and are\r\nessential in every period and to every nation. Their functions are part\r\nof the bed-rock of naval organization and of naval strategy, throughout\r\nall time; and the particular instances here selected owe their special\r\ncogency mainly to the fact that they are drawn from a naval era,\r\n1739-1815, of exceptional activity and brilliancy.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another sense in which an officer, or a man, may be\r\naccurately called a type; a sense no less significant, but of more\r\nlimited and transient application. The tendency of a period,--especially\r\nwhen one of marked transition,--its activities and its results, not\r\ninfrequently find expression in one or more historical characters. Such\r\ntypes may perhaps more accurately be called personifications; the man or\r\nmen embodying, and in action realizing, ideas and processes of thought,\r\nthe progress of which is at the time united, but is afterwards\r\nrecognized as a general characteristic of the period. Between the\r\nbeginning and the end a great change is found to have been effected,\r\nwhich naturally and conveniently is associated with the names of the\r\nmost conspicuous actors; although they are not the sole agents, but\r\nsimply the most eminent.\r\n\r\nIt is in this sense more particularly that Hawke and Rodney are\r\npresented as types. It might even be said that they complement each\r\nother and constitute together a single type; for, while both were men of\r\nunusually strong personality, private as well as professional, and with\r\nvery marked traits of character, their great relation to naval advance\r\nis that of men who by natural faculty detect and seize upon incipient\r\nideas, for which the time is ripe, and upon the practical realization of\r\nwhich the healthful development of the profession depends. With these\r\ntwo, and with them not so much contemporaneously as in close historical\r\nsequence, is associated the distinctive evolution of naval warfare in\r\nthe eighteenth century; in their combined names is summed up the\r\nimprovement of system to which Nelson and his contemporaries fell heirs,\r\nand to which Nelson, under the peculiar and exceptional circumstances\r\nwhich made his opportunity, gave an extension that immortalized him. Of\r\nHawke and Rodney, therefore, it may be said that they are in their\r\nprofession types of that element of change, in virtue of which the\r\nprofession grows; whereas the other four, eminent as they were,\r\nexemplify rather the conservative forces, the permanent features, in the\r\nstrength of which it exists, and in the absence of any one of which it\r\ndroops or succumbs. It does not, however, follow that the one of these\r\ngreat men is the simple continuator of the other's work; rather it is\r\ntrue that each contributed, in due succession of orderly development,\r\nthe factor of progress which his day demanded, and his personality\r\nembodied.\r\n\r\nIt was not in the forecast of the writer, but in the process of\r\ntreatment he came to recognize that, like Hawke and Rodney, the four\r\nothers also by natural characteristics range themselves in\r\npairs,--presenting points of contrast, in deficiencies and in\r\nexcellencies, which group them together, not by similarity chiefly, but\r\nas complementary. Howe and Jervis were both admirable general officers;\r\nbut the strength of the one lay in his tactical acquirements, that of\r\nthe other in strategic insight and breadth of outlook. The one was\r\neasy-going and indulgent as a superior; the other conspicuous for\r\nseverity, and for the searchingness with which he carried the exactions\r\nof discipline into the minute details of daily naval life. Saumarez and\r\nPellew, less fortunate, did not reach high command until the great days\r\nof naval warfare in their period had yielded to the comparatively\r\nuneventful occupation of girdling the enemy's coast with a system of\r\nblockades, aimed primarily at the restriction of his commerce, and\r\nincidentally at the repression of his navy, which made no effort to take\r\nthe sea on a large scale. Under these circumstances the functions of an\r\nadmiral were mainly administrative; and if Saumarez and Pellew\r\npossessed eminent capacity as general officers on the battle-field, they\r\nhad not opportunity to prove it. The distinction of their careers\r\ncoincides with their tenure of subordinate positions in the organisms of\r\ngreat fleets. With this in common, and differentiating them from Howe\r\nand Jervis, the points of contrast are marked. Saumarez preferred the\r\nship-of-the-line, Pellew the frigate. The choice of the one led to the\r\nduties of a division commander, that of the other to the comparative\r\nindependence of detached service, of the partisan officer. In the one,\r\nlove of the military side of his calling predominated; the other was,\r\nbefore all, the seaman. The union of the two perfects professional\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe question may naturally be asked,--Why, among types of naval\r\nofficers, is there no mention, other than casual, of the name of Nelson?\r\nThe answer is simple. Among general officers, land and sea, the group to\r\nwhich Nelson belongs defies exposition by a type, both because it is\r\nsmall in aggregate numbers, and because the peculiar eminence of the\r\nseveral members,--the eminence of genius,--so differentiates each from\r\nhis fellows that no one among them can be said to represent the others.\r\nEach, in the supremacy of his achievement, stands alone,--alone, not\r\nonly regarded as towering above a brilliant surrounding of distinguished\r\nfollowers, but alone even as contrasted with the other great ones who in\r\ntheir own day had a like supremacy. Such do not in fact form a class,\r\nbecause, though a certain community of ideas and principles may be\r\ntraced in their actions, their personalities and methods bear each the\r\nstamp of originality in performance; and where originality is found,\r\nclassification ceases to apply. There is a company, it may be, but not a\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe last four biographies first appeared as contributions to the\r\n\"Atlantic Monthly,\" in 1893 and 1894.

Such a reckoning, however, is not a mere matter of\r\nmore and less, of comparison between the beginning and the end,\r\nregardless of intermediate circumstances. The question involved is one\r\nof an historical process, of cause and effect; of an evolution, probably\r\nmarked, as such series of events commonly are, by certain salient\r\nincidents, the way-marks of progress which show the road traversed and\r\nthe succession of stages through which the past has become the present.\r\nFrequently, also, such development associates itself not only with\r\nconspicuous events, but with the names of great men, to whom, either by\r\noriginality of genius or by favoring opportunity, it has fallen to\r\nillustrate in action the changes which have a more silent antecedent\r\nhistory in the experience and reflection of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe development of naval warfare in the eighteenth century, its advance\r\nin spirit and methods, is thus exemplified in certain striking events,\r\nand yet more impressively is identified with the great names of Hawke\r\nand Rodney. The period of nearly half a generation intervened between\r\ntheir births, but they were contemporaries and actors, though to no\r\nlarge extent associates, during the extensive wars that occupied the\r\nmiddle of the century--the War of the Austrian Succession, 1739-1748,\r\nand the Seven Years War, 1756-1763. These two conflicts are practically\r\none; the same characteristic jealousies and motives being common to\r\nboth, as they were also to the period of nominal peace, but scarcely\r\nveiled contention, by which they were separated. The difference of age\r\nbetween the two admirals contributed not only to obviate rivalry, by\r\nthrowing their distinctive activities into different generations, but\r\nhad, as it were, the effect of prolonging their influence beyond that\r\npossible to a single lifetime, thus constituting it into a continuous\r\nand fruitful development.\r\n\r\nThey were both successful men, in the ordinary acceptation of the word\r\nsuccess. They were great, not only in professional character, but in the\r\nresults which do not always attend professional desert; they were great\r\nin achievement. Each name is indissolubly linked with a brilliant\r\nvictory, as well as with other less known but equally meritorious\r\nactions; in all of which the personal factor of the principal agent, the\r\ndistinctive qualities of the commander-in-chief, powerfully contributed\r\nand were conspicuously illustrated. These were, so to say, the examples,\r\nthat enforced upon the men of their day the professional ideas by which\r\nthe two admirals were themselves dominated, and upon which was forming a\r\nschool, with professional standards of action and achievement destined\r\nto produce great effects.\r\n\r\nYet, while this is so, and while such emphatic demonstrations by deeds\r\nundoubtedly does more than any other teaching to influence\r\ncontemporaries, and so to promote professional development, it is\r\nprobably true that, as a matter of historical illustration, the advance\r\nof the eighteenth century in naval warfare is more clearly shown by two\r\ngreat failures, for neither of which were these officers responsible,\r\nand in one only of which in fact did either appear, even in a\r\nsubordinate capacity. The now nearly forgotten miscarriage of Admiral\r\nMathews off Toulon, in 1744, and the miserable incompetency of Byng, at\r\nMinorca, in 1756, remembered chiefly because of the consequent execution\r\nof the admiral, serve at least, historically, to mark the low extreme to\r\nwhich had then sunk professional theory and practice--for both were\r\nthere involved. It is, however, not only as a point of departure from\r\nwhich to estimate progress that these battles--if they deserve the\r\nname--are historically useful. Considered as the plane to which\r\nexertion, once well directed and virile, had gradually declined through\r\nthe prevalence of false ideals, they link the seventeenth century to the\r\neighteenth, even as the thought and action--the theory and practice--of\r\nHawke and Rodney uplifted the navy from the inefficiency of Mathews and\r\nByng to the crowning glories of the Nile and Trafalgar, with which the\r\nnineteenth century opened. It is thus, as the very bottom of the wave,\r\nthat those singular and signal failures have their own distinctive\r\nsignificance in the undulations of the onward movement. On the one hand\r\nthey are not unaccountable, as though they, any more than the Nile and\r\nTrafalgar, were without antecedent of cause; and on the other they\r\nserve, as a background at least, to bring out the figures of the two\r\nadmirals now before us, and to define their true historical import, as\r\nagents and as exponents, in the changes of their day.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, important to the comprehension of the changes effected\r\nin that period of transition, for which Hawke and Rodney stand, to\r\nrecognize the distinctive lesson of each of these two abortive actions,\r\nwhich together may be said to fix the zero of the scale by which the\r\nprogress of the eighteenth century is denoted. They have a relation to\r\nthe past as well as to the future, standing far below the level of the\r\none and of the other, through causes that can be assigned. Naval warfare\r\nin the past, in its origin and through long ages, had been waged with\r\nvessels moved by oars, which consequently, when conditions permitted\r\nengaging at all, could be handled with a scope and freedom not securable\r\nwith the uncertain factor of the wind. The motive power of the sea,\r\ntherefore, then resembled essentially that of the land,--being human\r\nmuscle and staying power, in the legs on shore and in the arms at sea.\r\nHence, movements by masses, by squadrons, and in any desired direction\r\ncorresponding to a fixed plan, in order to concentrate, or to\r\noutflank,--all these could be attempted with a probability of success\r\nnot predicable of the sailing ship. Nelson's remarkable order at\r\nTrafalgar, which may almost be said to have closed and sealed the record\r\nof the sail era, began by assuming the extreme improbability of being\r\nable at any given moment to move forty ships of his day in a fixed order\r\nupon an assigned plan. The galley admiral therefore wielded a weapon far\r\nmore flexible and reliable, within the much narrower range of its\r\nactivities, than his successor in the days of sail; and engagements\r\nbetween fleets of galleys accordingly reflected this condition, being\r\nmarked not only by greater carnage, but by tactical combinations and\r\naudacity of execution, to which the sailing ship did not so readily lend\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nWhen the field of naval warfare became extended beyond the\r\nMediterranean,--for long centuries its principal scene,--the galley no\r\nlonger met the more exacting nautical conditions; and the introduction\r\nof cannon, involving new problems of tactics and ship-building,\r\naccelerated its disappearance. The traditions of galley-fighting,\r\nhowever, remained, and were reinforced by the habits of land\r\nfighting,--the same men in fact commanding armies on shore and fleets at\r\nsea. In short, a period of transition ensued, marked, as such in their\r\nbeginnings are apt to be, by an evident lack of clearness in men's\r\nappreciation of conditions, and of the path of development, with a\r\nconsequent confusion of outline in their practice. It is not always easy\r\nto understand either what was done, or what was meant to be done, during\r\nthat early sail era; but two things appear quite certainly. There is\r\nstill shown the vehemence and determination of action which\r\ncharacterized galley fighting, visible constantly in the fierce effort\r\nto grapple the enemy, to break his ranks, to confuse and crush him; and\r\nfurther there is clear indication of tactical plan on the grand scale,\r\nbroad in outline and combination, involving different--but not\r\nindependent--action by the various great divisions of the fleet, each of\r\nwhich, in plan at least, has its own part, subordinate but contributory\r\nto the general whole.\r\n\r\nThe results, though not unimportant, were not satisfactory, for men\r\nwere compelled to see that from various causes the huge numbers brought\r\nupon the field lapsed into confusion, and that battle, however well\r\nplanned in large outline, resolved itself into a mere mass of warring\r\nunits incoherently struggling one with another. There was lack of\r\nproportion between effort exerted and effect achieved. A period of\r\nsystematization and organization set in. Unwieldy numbers were reduced\r\nto more manageable dimensions by excluding ships whose size and strength\r\ndid not add to the efficiency of the order of battle; the powers and\r\nlimitations of those which remained were studied, and certain simple\r\ntactical dispositions, fitted to particular emergencies, were recognized\r\nand adopted,--all tending to impart unity of movement and action, and to\r\nkeep the whole in regulated order under the hand of the\r\ncommander-in-chief, free from confusion.\r\n\r\nTo this point there was improvement; but reaction, as often, went too\r\nfar. The change in accepted ideas is emphatically shown by a comparison\r\nof the Fighting Instructions of 1740 and 1756, when the crystallization\r\nof the system was complete but disintegration had not yet begun, with\r\nthose issued in 1665 by the Duke of York, afterwards James II., at the\r\nbeginning of the second of the three Anglo-Dutch Wars. His in turn are\r\ndirectly deducible from others framed shortly after the first war, in\r\n1652-1654, when sail tactics had not passed the stage of infancy, and\r\nwere still strongly affected by the galley tradition. There is here\r\nfound, on the one hand, the prescription of the line of battle,--a\r\nsingle column of ships formed in each other's wake,--with the provision\r\nthat if the enemy is to leeward, and awaits attack, the headmost\r\nsquadron of the British shall steer for the headmost of the enemy's\r\nships. This accords with the general tenor of the later Instructions;\r\nbut there occurs elsewhere, and previously, the direction that, when the\r\nenemy is to windward, if the leading British Squadron finds it can\r\nweather any considerable part of them, it is to \"tack and stand in, and\r\nstrive to divide the enemy's body,\" and that, \"being got to windward, is\r\nto bear down on those ships to leeward of them,\" which have thus been\r\ncut off.\r\n\r\nThe thing to be observed here is the separate, but positive, initiative\r\nprescribed for a portion of the fleet, with a view to divide the enemy,\r\nand then concentrate the whole fleet upon the fraction thus isolated.\r\nThe British van takes a particular, but not an independent, action; for\r\nthe other divisions contribute their part to the common purpose. \"The\r\nmiddle squadron is to keep her wind, and to observe the motion of the\r\nenemy's van, which\" [that is, \"which\" action of the middle squadron]\r\n\"the last squadron--the rear--is to second; and both of these squadrons\r\nare to do their utmost to assist or relieve the first squadron, that\r\ndivided the enemy's fleet.\" Evidently here we have tactical combination\r\nin order to decisive action; clearly contemplated also beforehand, not\r\nmerely by a capable individual general, but by the consensus of\r\nprofessional opinion which such a paper as the Fighting Instructions\r\nnecessarily reflects. The stamp of the galley period is upon this:\r\nstrenuous and close battle, the piercing of the enemy's order, the\r\nmovement of the squadrons differentiated, in order that they may in a\r\nreal and effective sense _combine_, instead of being merely\r\n_distributed_, as they afterwards were by both the letter of the later\r\nInstructions and the tradition by which these became encrusted. Nor\r\nshould there be overlooked, in this connection, the discretion allowed\r\nthe centre and rear. They are to \"keep their wind;\" an expression which\r\nleaves optional whether to tack, or stand as they are, whether to engage\r\nthe separated enemies to windward or to leeward, as occasion may offer,\r\nin support of the van. The provisions of 1665 afterwards disappear. In\r\n1740, and even as late as 1781, they are traceable only in certain\r\ncolorless articles, suggestive of the atrophied organs of a body\r\nconcerning whose past use physiologists may speculate.\r\n\r\nAs in the restoration of sounder methods, with which we shall be\r\nconcerned, this degeneration of ideals was a work of time. In June,\r\n1666, the British met with a severe check in the Four Days Battle, in\r\nwhich Monk, a soldier, commanded in chief. This reverse is chiefly to\r\nbe attributed to antecedent strategic errors, which made a portion only\r\nof the available British force bear the brunt of the first three days;\r\nbut, among the inevitable criticisms, we find stress laid upon fighting\r\nin line as essential to success. This insistence upon the line as an\r\neffective instrument proceeded, among others, from Sir William Penn, a\r\nseaman, and was at that time in the direction of professional advance.\r\nThe line had not yet obtained the general professional acceptance needed\r\nto establish and utilize its indisputable value. This process was\r\ngradual, but when effected it followed the usual laws of human\r\ndevelopment; from a valuable means, it became in men's estimation an\r\nexaggerated necessity. It came to pass in time that the line no longer\r\nexisted for tactics, but tactics for the line, in which they found their\r\nconsummation and end.\r\n\r\nThere intervened, however, a happier period,--one of transition,--and in\r\nthe third Anglo-Dutch war, 1672-1674, we seem to find a close approach\r\nto just proportion between regularity of formation and decisive tactical\r\npurpose; in which the principle of the line is recognized and observed,\r\nbut is utilized by professional audacity for definite and efficient\r\ntactical action, aiming at conclusive results. The finest exponent of\r\nthis, the culminating epoch of naval warfare in the seventeenth century,\r\nis the Dutchman Ruyter, who, taken altogether, was the greatest naval\r\nseaman of that era, which may be roughly identified with the reign of\r\nCharles II. After that, naval warfare was virtually suspended for\r\nfifteen years, and when resumed in the last decade of the century, the\r\ntraces of incipient degeneracy can already be noted amid much brilliant\r\nperformance. From that time completeness of military achievement became\r\nin men's minds less of an object than accurate observance of rule, and\r\nin practice the defensive consideration of avoiding disaster began to\r\npreponderate over offensive effort for the destruction of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the development of tactical science, the French had played a leading\r\npart, as they usually have where reflective mental processes and formal\r\nevolution of ideas are concerned. Among admirals, the greatest name of\r\nthis later period is the French Tourville, a master of the science of\r\nhis profession, and gifted with a personal courage of the heroic type;\r\nwhile the leading exponent of Tourville's ideas, as well as historian of\r\nhis achievements, was the French priest Paul Hoste,--chaplain to his\r\nfleet, and the father of the systematic treatment of naval evolutions.\r\nBut with Tourville's name is associated not only a high level of\r\nprofessional management, but a caution in professional action not far\r\nremoved from timidity, so that an impatient Minister of Marine of his\r\nday and nation styled him \"poltroon in head, though not in heart.\" His\r\npowers were displayed in the preservation and orderly movement of his\r\nfleet; in baffling, by sheer skill, and during long periods, the efforts\r\nof the enemy to bring him to action; in skilful disposition, when he\r\npurposely accepted battle under disadvantage; but under most favorable\r\nopportunities he failed in measures of energy, and, after achieving\r\npartial success, superfluous care of his own command prevented his blows\r\nfrom being driven home.\r\n\r\nTourville, though a brilliant seaman, thus not only typified an era of\r\ntransition, with which he was contemporary, but foreshadowed the period\r\nof merely formal naval warfare, precise, methodical, and unenterprising,\r\nemasculated of military virility, although not of mere animal courage.\r\nHe left to his successors the legacy of a great name, but also\r\nunfortunately that of a defective professional tradition. The splendid\r\ndays of the French Navy under Louis XIV. passed away with him,--he died\r\nin 1701; but during the long period of naval lethargy on the part of the\r\nstate, which followed, the French naval officers, as a class, never\r\nwholly lost sight of professional ideals. They proved themselves, on the\r\nrare occasions that offered, before 1715 and during the wars of Hawke\r\nand Rodney, not only gallant seamen after the pattern of Tourville, but\r\nalso exceedingly capable tacticians, upon a system good as far as it\r\nwent, but defective on Tourville's express lines, in aiming rather at\r\nexact dispositions and defensive security than at the thorough-going\r\ninitiative and persistence which confounds and destroys the enemy.\r\n\"War,\" to use Napoleon's phrase, \"was to be waged without running\r\nrisks.\" The sword was drawn, but the scabbard was kept ever open for its\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nThe English, in the period of reaction which succeeded the Dutch wars,\r\nproduced their own caricature of systematized tactics. Even under its\r\ninfluence, up to 1715, it is only just to say they did not construe\r\nnaval skill to mean anxious care to keep one's own ships intact. Rooke,\r\noff Malaga, in 1704, illustrated professional fearlessness of\r\nconsequences as conspicuously as he had shown personal daring in the\r\nboat attack at La Hougue; but his plans of battle exemplified the\r\nparticularly British form of inefficient naval action. There was no\r\ngreat difference in aggregate force between the French fleet and that of\r\nthe combined Anglo-Dutch under his orders. The former, drawing up in the\r\naccustomed line of battle, ship following ship in a single column,\r\nawaited attack. Rooke, having the advantage of the wind, and therefore\r\nthe power of engaging at will, formed his command in a similar and\r\nparallel line a few miles off, and thus all stood down together, the\r\nships maintaining their line parallel to that of the enemy, and coming\r\ninto action at practically the same moment, van to van, centre to\r\ncentre, rear to rear. This ignored wholly the essential maxim of all\r\nintelligent warfare, which is so to engage as markedly to outnumber the\r\nenemy at a point of main collision. If he be broken there, before the\r\nremainder of his force come up, the chances all are that a decisive\r\nsuperiority will be established by this alone, not to mention the moral\r\neffect of partial defeat and disorder. Instead of this, the impact at\r\nMalaga was so distributed as to produce a substantial equality from one\r\nend to the other of the opposing fronts. The French, indeed, by\r\nstrengthening their centre relatively to the van and rear, to some\r\nextent modified this condition in the particular instance; but the fact\r\ndoes not seem to have induced any alteration in Rooke's dispositions.\r\nBarring mere accident, nothing conclusive can issue from such\r\narrangements. The result accordingly was a drawn battle, although Rooke\r\nsays that the fight, which was maintained on both sides \"with great fury\r\nfor three hours, ... was the sharpest day's service that I ever saw;\" and\r\nhe had seen much,--Beachy Head, La Hougue, Vigo Bay, not to mention his\r\nown great achievement in the capture of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThis method of attack remained the ideal--if such a word is not a\r\nmisnomer in such a case--of the British Navy, not merely as a matter of\r\nirreflective professional acceptance, but laid down in the official\r\n\"Fighting Instructions.\" It cannot be said that these err on the side of\r\nlucidity; but their meaning to contemporaries in this particular\r\nrespect is ascertained, not only by fair inference from their contents,\r\nbut by the practical commentary of numerous actions under commonplace\r\ncommanders-in-chief. It further received authoritative formulation in\r\nthe specific finding of the Court-Martial upon Admiral Byng, which was\r\nsigned by thirteen experienced officers. \"Admiral Byng should have\r\ncaused his ships to tack together, and should immediately have borne\r\ndown upon the enemy; his van steering for the enemy's van, his rear for\r\nits rear, each ship making for the one opposite to her in the enemy's\r\nline, under such sail as would have enabled the worst sailer to preserve\r\nher station in the line of battle.\" Each phrase of this opinion is a\r\nreflection of an article in the Instructions. The line of battle was the\r\nnaval fetich of the day; and, be it remarked, it was the more dangerous\r\nbecause in itself an admirable and necessary instrument, constructed on\r\nprinciples essentially accurate. A standard wholly false may have its\r\nerror demonstrated with comparative ease; but no servitude is more\r\nhopeless than that of unintelligent submission to an idea formally\r\ncorrect, yet incomplete. It has all the vicious misleading of a\r\nhalf-truth unqualified by appreciation of modifying conditions; and so\r\nseamen who disdained theories, and hugged the belief in themselves as\r\n\"practical,\" became _doctrinaires_ in the worst sense.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, however, that a necessary antecedent to deliverance from\r\na false conception,--as from any injurious condition,--is a practical\r\nillustration of its fallacy. Working consequences must receive\r\ndemonstration, concrete in some striking disastrous event, before\r\nimprovement is undertaken. Such experience is painful to undergo; but\r\nwith most men, even in their private capacity, and in nearly all\r\ngovernmental action where mere public interests are at stake, remedy is\r\nrarely sought until suffering is not only felt, but signalized in a\r\nconspicuous incident. It is needless to say that the military\r\nprofessions in peace times are peculiarly liable to this apathy; like\r\nsome sleepers, they can be awakened only by shaking. For them, war alone\r\ncan subject accepted ideas to the extreme test of practice. It is\r\ndoubtless perfectly true that acquaintance with military and naval\r\nhistory, mastery of their teachings, will go far to anticipate the\r\npenalty attaching to truth's last argument--chastisement; but\r\nimagination is fondly impatient of warning by the past, and easily\r\navails itself of fancied or superficial differences in contemporary\r\nconditions, to justify measures which ignore, or even directly\r\ncontravene, ascertained and fundamental principles of universal\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nEven immediate practical experience is misinterpreted when incidents are\r\nthus viewed through the medium of a precedent bias. The Transvaal War,\r\nfor instance, has afforded some striking lessons of needed\r\nmodifications, consequent upon particular local factors, or upon\r\ndevelopments in the material of war; but does any thoughtful military\r\nman doubt that imagination has been actively at work, exaggerating or\r\ndistorting, hastily waiving aside permanent truth in favor of temporary\r\nprepossessions or accidental circumstance? It is at least equally likely\r\nthat the naval world at the present time is hugging some fond delusions\r\nin the excessive size and speed to which battle-ships are tending, and\r\nin the disproportionate weight assigned to the defensive as compared to\r\nthe offensive factors in a given aggregate tonnage. Imagination, theory,\r\n_a priori_ reasoning, is here at variance with rational historical\r\nprecedent, which has established the necessity of numbers as well as of\r\nindividual power in battle-ships, and demonstrated the superiority of\r\noffensive over defensive strength in military systems. These--and\r\nother--counterbalancing considerations have in past wars enforced the\r\nadoption of a medium homogeneous type, as conducive both to adequate\r\nnumbers,--which permit the division of the fleet when required for\r\nstrategic or tactical purposes,--and also directly to offensive fleet\r\nstrength by the greater facility of manoeuvring possessed by such\r\nvessels; for the strength of a fleet lies not chiefly in the single\r\nunits, but in their mutual support in elastic and rapid movement. Well\r\ntested precedent--experience--has here gone to the wall in favor of an\r\nuntried forecast of supposed fundamental change in conditions. But\r\nexperience is uncommonly disagreeable when she revenges herself after\r\nher own fashion.\r\n\r\nThe British Navy of the eighteenth century in this way received an\r\nunpleasant proof of the faultiness of its then accepted conclusions, in\r\nthe miscarriages of Mathews off Toulon, in 1744, and of Byng off\r\nMinorca, in 1756. So fixed were men's habits of thought that the lessons\r\nwere not at once understood. As evidenced by the distribution of\r\ncensure, the results were attributed by contemporary judges to\r\nparticular incidents of each battle, not to the erroneous underlying\r\ngeneral plans, contravening all sound military precedent, which from the\r\nfirst made success improbable, indeed impossible, except by an\r\ninefficiency of the enemy which was not to be presumed. These battles\r\ntherefore are important, militarily, in a sense not at all dependent\r\nupon their consequences, which were ephemeral. They are significant as\r\nextreme illustrations of incompetent action, deriving from faulty\r\ntraditions; and they have the further value of showing the starting\r\npoint, the zero of the scale, from which the progress of the century is\r\nto be measured. In describing them, therefore, attention will be given\r\nchiefly to those circumstances which exhibit the shackles under which\r\nfleet movements then labored, not only from the difficulties inherent to\r\nthe sea and sailing ships, but from the ideas and methods of the times.\r\nThose incidents also will be selected which show how false standards\r\naffected particular individuals, according to their personal\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nIn Admiral Mathews' action, in February, 1744, an allied fleet composed\r\nof sixteen French ships-of-the-line and twelve Spanish lay in Toulon,\r\nwaiting to sail for a Spanish port. The British, in force numerically\r\nequal, were at anchor under the Hyères Islands, a few miles to the\r\neastward. They got underway when the allied movement began on February\r\n20th; but anchored again for the night, because the enemy that day came\r\nno farther than the outer road of Toulon. The next morning the French\r\nand Spaniards put to sea with a wind at first westerly, and stretched to\r\nthe southward in long, single column, the sixteen French leading. At 10\r\nA.M. the British followed, Vice-Admiral Lestock's division taking the\r\nvan; but the wind, shifting to east, threw the fleet on the port tack,\r\non which the rear under Rear-Admiral Rowley had to lead. It became\r\nnecessary, therefore, for this division and the centre to pass Lestock,\r\nwhich took some time with the light airs prevailing. Two or three\r\nmanoeuvres succeeded, with the object of forming the fighting order, a\r\ncolumn similar and parallel to that of the enemy, and to get closer to\r\nhim. When night fell a signal was still flying for the line abreast, by\r\nwhich, if completed, the ships would be ranged on a line parallel to the\r\nallies, and heading towards them; consequently abreast of each other. It\r\nwould then need only a change of course to place them in column, sides\r\nto the enemy; which, as before said, was the fighting order--the \"line\r\nof battle.\"\r\n\r\nThe line abreast, however, was not fully formed at dark. Therefore the\r\nadmiral, in order to hasten its completion, soon afterwards made a night\r\nsignal, with lanterns, for the fleet to bring-to,--that is, bring their\r\nsides to the wind, and stop. He intended thereby that the ships already\r\nin station should stand still, while the others were gaining their\r\nplaces, all which is a case of simple evolution, by land as by sea. It\r\nwas contended by the admiral that Vice-Admiral Lestock's division was\r\nthen too far to the right and rear, and hence too distant from the\r\nenemy, and that it was his duty first to get into his station and then\r\nto bring-to. To this the vice-admiral on his trial replied, first, that\r\nhe was not out of his station; and, second, that if he were, the later\r\nsignal, to bring-to, suspended the earlier, to form line abreast, and\r\nthat it was therefore his business, without any discretion, to stop\r\nwhere he was. Concerning the first plea, a number of witnesses, very\r\nrespectable in point of rank and opportunity for seeing, testified that\r\nthe vice-admiral did bring-to three or four miles to the right and rear\r\nof his place in the line abreast, reckoning his station from the\r\nadmiral's ship; yet, as the Court peremptorily rejected their evidence,\r\nit is probably proper to accept the contemporary decision as to this\r\nmatter of fact.\r\n\r\nBut as regards the second plea, being a matter of military correctness,\r\na difference of opinion is allowable. The Court adopted as its own the\r\nargument of the vice-admiral. Without entering here into a technical\r\ndiscussion, the Court's ruling, briefly stated, was that the second\r\nsignal superseded the first, so that, if the vice-admiral was in the\r\nwrong place, it was not his duty to get into the right before stopping;\r\nand that this was doubly the case because an article of the Night\r\nSignals (7) prescribed that, under the conditions of the alleged\r\noffence, \"a fleet sailing before the wind, or nearly so, if the admiral\r\nmade the signal for the fleet to bring-to, the windward ships should\r\nbring-to first.\" Therefore, if Lestock was to windward, as the charge\r\nread, it was his duty to bring-to first and at once. It is evident,\r\nhowever, that even the Sailing Instructions, cast-iron as they were,\r\ncontemplated a fleet in order, not one in process of forming order; and\r\nthat to bring-to helter-skelter, regardless of order, was to obey the\r\nletter rather than the spirit. Muddle-headed as Mathews seems to have\r\nbeen, what he was trying to do was clear enough; and the duty of a\r\nsubordinate was to carry out his evident aim. An order does not\r\nnecessarily supersede its predecessor, unless the two are incompatible.\r\nThe whole incident, from Lestock's act to the Court's finding, is\r\ninstructive as showing the slavish submission to the letter of the\r\nInstructions; a submission traceable not to the law merely, but to the\r\nadded tradition that had then fast hold of men's minds. It is most\r\ninteresting to note that the unfortunate Byng was one of the signers of\r\nthis opinion, as he was also one of the judges that sentenced Mathews to\r\nbe dismissed from the navy, as responsible for the general failure.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 21st the allies, who had stopped after dark,\r\nappear again to have made sail. Consequently, when day broke, the\r\nBritish found themselves some distance astern and to windward--\r\nnortheast; the wind continuing easterly. Their line, indifferently\r\nwell formed in van and centre, stretched over a length of nine\r\nmiles through the straggling of the rear. Lestock's ship was six\r\nmiles from that of Mathews, whereas it should not have been more than\r\ntwo and a half, at most, in ordinary sailing; for battle, the\r\nInstructions allowed little over a half-mile. Accepting the Court's\r\nfinding that he was in position at dark, this distance can only be\r\nattributed, as Lestock argued and the Court admitted, to a current--that\r\nmost convenient of scape-goats in navigation. The allies, too, had a\r\nlagging rear body, five Spanish ships being quite a distance astern; but\r\nfrom van to rear they extended but six miles, against the British nine.\r\nIt was the distance of the British rear, not straggling in van or\r\ncentre, that constituted this disadvantage.\r\n\r\nMathews wished to wait till Lestock reached his place, but the allies\r\nwere receding all the time; and, though their pace was slackened to\r\nenable the five sternmost Spaniards to come up, the space between the\r\nfleets was increasing. It was the duty of the British admiral to force\r\nan action, on general principles; but in addition he believed that the\r\nFrench intended to push for Gibraltar, enter the Atlantic, and join\r\ntheir Brest fleet, in order to cover an invasion of England by an army\r\nreported to be assembling at Dunkirk. Clearly, therefore, something must\r\nbe done; yet to enter into a general engagement with near a third of his\r\ncommand out of immediate supporting distance was contrary to the\r\naccepted principles of the day. The fleet was not extended with that of\r\nthe enemy, by which is meant that the respective vans, centres, and\r\nrears were not opposed; the British van being only abreast of the allied\r\ncentre, their centre of the allied rear, Lestock tailing away astern and\r\nto windward, while the dozen leading French were some distance ahead of\r\nboth bodies. Now the Fighting Instructions required that, \"If the\r\nadmiral and his fleet have the wind of the enemy, and they have\r\nstretched themselves in a line of battle, the van of the admiral's fleet\r\nis to steer with the van of the enemies, and _there_ to engage them.\"\r\nThere was no alternative course laid down; just as there was no\r\npunishment alternative to death in the Article of War under which Byng\r\nwas shot.\r\n\r\nYet the indications all were that to wait for this most formal and\r\npedantic disposition, which ignored every principle of warfare, would\r\nbe to throw away the chance of battle. The French, fresh from port and\r\nclean-bottomed, out-sailed the bulk of the British, as did the\r\nSpaniards, though to a less degree; and it was part of Lestock's\r\ndefence, admitted by the Court, that, doing his utmost, his division, as\r\na whole, certainly could not get abreast the allied rear. Lestock,\r\nindeed, directly submitted to the Court that the commander-in-chief was\r\nat fault in not waiting till his line was thus extended and formed, and\r\nthen all bearing down together, in line abreast; although by his own\r\ncontention no such issue could have been reached that day, unless the\r\nallies were obliging enough to wait. \"I aver, and I shall die in this\r\nopinion, that no man that is an officer, who knows his duty, will make\r\nthe signal for line abreast to steer down upon an enemy, until the fleet\r\nhas been stretched and extended in a line of battle, according to the\r\n19th Article of the Fighting Instructions. Can it be service,\" he adds,\r\n\"to bear down so much unformed and in confusion, that the van cannot\r\npossibly join battle with, or engage the van of the enemy, the centre\r\nwith the centre, and the rear with the rear?\"\r\n\r\nMathews not being then on trial, the Court in its finding did not reply\r\ndirectly to this question; but indirectly it left no doubt as to its\r\nopinion. \"The Admiral, by bearing down as he did upon the rear division\r\nof the combined fleet, excluded the Vice-Admiral from any part of the\r\nengagement, if he could have come up; for if both lines had been closed,\r\nwhen the Admiral engaged the _Real_, there would have been no more than\r\none ship of the enemy's fleet for the Vice-Admiral and his whole\r\ndivision to have engaged.\" Again, \"It does not appear that the\r\nVice-Admiral was in any part the cause of the miscarriage of his\r\nMajesty's fleet in the Mediterranean; the _bringing on of the general\r\nengagement according to the 19th Article_ of the Fighting\r\nInstructions ... not depending upon him.\" Sixteen officers of the rank of\r\ncaptain and above signed these opinions, and there is no denying the\r\nwords of the 19th Article; yet one wonders to see no recognition of the\r\nnecessity of using your opportunity as you find it, of the moral effect\r\nof an approaching reserve, which Lestock's division would have\r\nconstituted, of the part it may take in improving or repairing the\r\nresults of an action--taking the place of injured friends, preventing\r\ninjured foes escaping, turning doubtful battle into victory. But no;\r\nthese commonplaces of to-day and of all time were swamped by the\r\nFighting Instructions. It will be seen in the sequel what a disastrous\r\nmoral influence Lestock's aloofness exercised upon a few timid captains,\r\nand not improbably upon the entire subsequent course and worst errors of\r\nhis unfortunate superior.\r\n\r\nOne of the witnesses in the ensuing Courts-Martial testified that the\r\ncommander-in-chief, under these perplexing circumstances, went into the\r\nstern gallery of the flag-ship _Namur_, and called to Captain Cornwall\r\nof the _Marlborough_, next astern, asking what he thought. Cornwall\r\nreplied he \"believed they would lose the glory of the day, if they did\r\nnot attack the Spaniards,\"--_i.e._, the allied rear-centre and\r\nrear,--\"the Vice-Admiral--Lestock--being so far astern.\" To which the\r\nadmiral said, \"If you'll bear down and attack the _Real_,\"--the _Real\r\nFelipe_, Spanish flag-ship,--\"I'll be your second.\" This was about one\r\no'clock, and the signal to engage had been made two hours earlier,\r\nprobably with the double object of indicating the ultimate intention of\r\nthe movements in hand, and the immediate urgency of forming the line.\r\nThe admiral's words betray the indecision of an irresolute nature and of\r\nprofessional rustiness, but not of timidity, and Cornwall's words turned\r\nthe scale. The course of the flag-ship _Namur_ had hitherto been but a\r\nlittle off the wind, \"lasking\" down, to use the contemporary but long\r\nobsolete expression, in such manner as to show the admiral's desire to\r\nengage himself with the enemy's centre, according to the Fighting\r\nInstructions; but now, in hopelessness of that result, she kept broad\r\noff, directly for the nearest enemy, accompanied closely by the\r\n_Norfolk_, her next ahead, and by the _Marlborough_. Rear-Admiral\r\nRowley, commanding the van, imitated the admiral's example, bringing the\r\nFrench ship abreast him to close action. He also was thoroughly\r\nsupported by the two captains next astern of him, the second of whom was\r\nEdward Hawke,--afterwards the brilliant admiral,--in the _Berwick_. Two\r\nBritish groups, each of three ships, were thus hotly engaged; but with\r\nan interval between them of over half a mile, corresponding to the\r\nplaces open for six or seven other vessels. The conduct of the ships\r\nnamed, under the immediate influence of the example set by the two\r\nadmirals, suggests how much the average man is sustained by professional\r\ntone; for a visible good example is simply a good standard, a high\r\nideal, realized in action.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, just as Hawke's later doings showed the man able\r\nto rise above the level of prescribed routine duty, there was found in\r\nthe second astern of the _Namur_ a captain capable of exceptional\r\nbackwardness, of reasoning himself into dereliction of clear duty, and\r\nthus effecting a demonstration that the example of timidity is full as\r\ncontagious and more masterful than that of audacity. The flag-ships and\r\ntheir supporters ranged themselves along the hostile line to windward,\r\nwithin point-blank range; according to the 20th Article of the Fighting\r\nInstructions, which read, \"Every Commander is to take care that his guns\r\nare not fired till he is sure he can reach the enemy upon a point-blank;\r\nand by no means to suffer his guns to be fired over any of our own\r\nships.\" The point-blank is the range of a cannon laid level, and the\r\nrequirement was necessary to efficient action in those days of crude\r\ndevices for pointing, with ordnance material of inferior power. Even\r\nsixty years later Nelson expressed his indifference to improvements in\r\npointing, on the ground that the true way of fighting was to get so\r\nclose that you could not miss your aim. Thus Mathews' captain placed the\r\n_Namur_, of ninety guns, within four hundred yards--less than quarter of\r\na mile--of the Spanish flag-ship, the _Real Felipe_, of one hundred and\r\nten guns; and Cornwall brought the _Marlborough_ immediately in the wake\r\nof the _Namur_, engaging the Spanish _Hercules_. But the _Dorsetshire_,\r\nwhich should have followed the _Marlborough_, was stopped by her\r\ncommander, Captain George Burrish, at a distance which was estimated by\r\nseveral witnesses to be from half a mile to nearly a mile from the\r\nenemy, or, to use a very expressive phrase then current, \"at random\r\nshot.\" The Court-Martial, however, in pronouncing upon this point,\r\ndecided that inasmuch as a bar-shot came on board the _Dorsetshire_ in\r\nthis early part of the engagement, she must be construed to have brought\r\nto within extreme point-blank. In view of the mass of testimony to the\r\ngreater distance, this seems to have been simply giving the benefit of a\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nThus situated, the action between the _Namur_ and _Marlborough_ on the\r\none side, and the _Real Felipe_ and _Hercules_ on the other, was for\r\nsome time very hot; but the _Marlborough_, moving faster than the\r\n_Namur_, closed upon her, so that she had to get out of the way, which\r\nshe did by moving ahead and at the same time hauling to windward, till\r\nshe reached as far from the Spanish line as the _Dorsetshire_ had\r\nremained. The Court in this matter decided that, after the admiral had\r\nthus hauled off, the _Dorsetshire_ was in a line, or as far to\r\nleeward--towards the enemy--as the admiral. The _Marlborough_ was thus\r\nleft alone, exposed to the fire of a ship heavier than herself, and also\r\nto that of the _Hercules_, which was able to train upon her a\r\nconsiderable part of her battery. Under these circumstances, it was the\r\nduty of the _Dorsetshire_, as it was the opportunity of her commander,\r\nby attacking the _Hercules_, to second, and support, the engaged ship;\r\nbut she continued aloof. After two hours--by 3 P.M.--the main and mizzen\r\nmasts were cut out of the _Marlborough_, and she lost her captain with\r\nforty-two men killed, and one hundred and twenty wounded, out of a crew\r\nof seven hundred and fifty. Thus disabled, the sails on the foremast\r\nturned her head towards the enemy, and she lay moving sluggishly,\r\nbetween the fleets, but not under control. The admiral now sent an\r\nofficer to Burrish--the second that morning--to order him into his\r\nstation and to support the _Marlborough_; while to the latter, in\r\nresponse to an urgent representation by boat of her condition, and that\r\nshe was threatened by the approach of the hitherto separated ships of\r\nthe Spanish rear, he replied that the _Namur_ was wearing and would come\r\nto her assistance.\r\n\r\nWhen Burrish received his message, he sent for his lieutenants on the\r\nquarter-deck, and spoke to them words which doubtless reflect the\r\nreasoning upon which he was justifying to himself his most culpable\r\ninaction. \"Gentlemen, I sent for you to show you the position of our\r\nships to windward,\" (_i.e._ the ships of the centre division behind him,\r\nand Lestock's division), \"likewise those five sail [Spanish] of the\r\nenemy that are astern of us. I have my orders to engage the _Real_, and\r\nyou see I am bearing down for that purpose.\" The lieutenants remarked\r\nthat he could do so with safety. To this he rejoined, with a curtness\r\nthat testifies to the uneasiness of his mind, \"I did not send for you to\r\nask your opinions, but only to observe that not one of our ships is\r\ncoming down to my assistance, in order to cut those five sail off, and\r\nin case those five sail should oblige me to haul my wind again, and\r\nleave the _Marlborough_, that you may be able to indemnify my conduct,\r\nif called in question.\" One witness also testified that he \"was angry\r\nthat Admiral Lestock's division did not bear down,\"--which was just\r\nenough,--and that \"he thought it most advisable to keep his station;\"\r\nmeaning by this, apparently, to remain where he was. His\r\ncross-examination of the evidence was directed to prove the danger to\r\nhis ship from these remaining Spaniards. This anxiety was wholly\r\nmisplaced, and professionally unworthy. Quite independent of orders by\r\nsignal and message, he was bound, in view of the condition of the\r\n_Marlborough_, to go to her relief, and to assume that the three English\r\nships of the centre division, in his rear, would surely sustain him. To\r\nbase contrary action upon a doubt of their faithfulness was to condemn\r\nhimself. Four ships to five under such conditions should be rather a\r\nspur than a deterrent to an officer of spirit, who understands the\r\nobligation of his calling.\r\n\r\nTill this, the _Dorsetshire_ had been under her three topsails only. She\r\nappears then to have stood down under more sail, but very slowly, and\r\nhere occurred another disaster which was largely chargeable to her being\r\nout of her station. Seeing the desperate state of the _Marlborough_,\r\nMathews, who throughout managed blunderingly, with the single exception\r\nof the original attack, had thought to aid her and divert the fire of\r\nthe _Real_ by sending against the latter a fire-ship. It was elementary\r\nthat vessels of this class needed energetic support and cover in their\r\ndesperate work. Small in size, of no battery-force except against boat\r\nattacks, loaded with combustibles and powder, success in the use of them\r\nunder an enemy's guns required not only imperturbable coolness and\r\nnerve, but the utmost attainable immunity from the attention of the\r\nenemy. This could be secured only by a heavy and sustained fire from\r\ntheir own fleet. With the _Norfolk_, _Namur_, _Marlborough_, and\r\n_Dorsetshire_ in close line, as they should have been, and heavily\r\nengaged, a fire-ship might have passed between them, and, though at\r\nimminent hazard even so, have crossed the four hundred yards of\r\nintervening water to grapple the hostile flag-ship; but with the\r\n_Marlborough_ lying disabled and alone, the admiral himself acting with\r\nindecision, and the _Dorsetshire_ hanging aloof, the attempt was little\r\nshort of hopeless. Still it was made, and the _Anne Galley_--such was\r\nher odd name--bore down, passing close by the _Dorsetshire_.\r\n\r\nIt became doubly the duty of Burrish to act, to push home whatever\r\ndemonstration was in his power to make; the fire-ship, however, went by\r\nhim and was permitted to pursue her desperate mission without his\r\nsupport. The _Real_, seeing the _Anne_ approach, bore up out of her\r\nline, and at the same time sent a strongly-manned launch to grapple and\r\ntow her out of the way. This was precisely one of the measures that it\r\nwas the business of supporting ships to repel. The captain of the\r\nfire-ship, thrown upon his own resources, opened fire, a most hazardous\r\nmeasure, as much of his priming was with loose powder; but the launch\r\nreadily avoided injury by taking position directly ahead, where the guns\r\nwould not bear. The crew of the _Anne_ were now ordered into the boat,\r\nexcept the captain and five others, who were to remain to the last\r\nmoment, and light the train; but from some cause not certainly\r\ndemonstrated she exploded prematurely, being then within a hundred yards\r\nof the _Real_. It is necessary to say that the Court-Martial acquitted\r\nBurrish of blame, because he \"had no orders to cover the fire-ship,\r\neither by signal or otherwise.\" Technically, the effect of this finding\r\nwas to shift an obvious and gross blunder from the captain to some one\r\nelse; but it is evident that if the _Dorsetshire_ had occupied her\r\nstation astern of the _Marlborough_, the fire-ship's attempt would have\r\nbeen much facilitated.\r\n\r\nThe Court decided unanimously that Burrish \"ought to have borne down as\r\nfar to leeward as where the admiral first began to engage,\r\nnotwithstanding that the admiral might be hauled off before the\r\n_Dorsetshire_ got so far to leeward.\" The point upon which the line\r\nshould have been formed was thus established by the Court's finding. The\r\nsubsequent proceedings of this ship need not be related. She now came\r\nslowly into close action, but that part of the enemy's order was already\r\nbroken, and their rear vessels, the fear of which had controlled her\r\ncaptain, passed by as they came up without serious action.\r\n\r\nHow far Burrish's example influenced the captains immediately behind him\r\ncannot certainly be affirmed. Such shyness as he displayed is not only\r\ninfectious, but saps that indispensable basis upon which military\r\neffectiveness reposes, namely, the certainty of co-operation and\r\nsupport, derived from mutual confidence, inspired by military\r\ndiscipline, obedience, and honor. It is well to note here that the\r\nremoteness of Lestock's division thus affected Burrish, who evidently\r\ncould not understand either its distance or its failure to approach, and\r\nwho, being what he was, saw himself threatened with want of that backing\r\nwhich he himself was refusing to the _Marlborough_. While he was blaming\r\nLestock, hard things were being said about him in Lestock's division;\r\nbut the lesson of Lestock's influence upon Burrish is not less\r\nnoteworthy because the latter forfeited both duty and honor by his\r\nhesitation. It is to be feared that the captain of the _Essex_,\r\nfollowing the _Dorsetshire_, was a coward; even so Burrish, an old\r\ncaptain, certainly did not cheer his heart by good example, but rather\r\ngave him the pretext for keeping still farther off. The rearmost two\r\nships of the division but confirm the evidences of demoralization, and\r\nthe more so that their captains seem from the evidence to have been\r\nwell-disposed average men; but the five Spanish vessels approaching,\r\nwith the _Dorsetshire_ and the _Essex_ holding aloof, was too much for\r\ntheir resolution--and not unnaturally. The broad result, however, was\r\nlamentable; for four British ships feared to come to the aid of an\r\nheroic and desperately injured consort, in deadly peril, because five\r\nenemies were drawing nigh.\r\n\r\nUpon these four therefore fell, and not unjustly, the weight of national\r\nanger. Burrish was cashiered, and declared forever incapable of being an\r\nofficer in the Navy. Norris, of the _Essex_, absconded to avoid trial.\r\nThe two others were pronounced unfit to command, but, although never\r\nagain employed, mitigating circumstances in their behavior caused them\r\nto be retained on the lists of the Navy. It is not too much to say that\r\nthey were men just of the stamp to have escaped this shame and ruin of\r\nreputation, under more favorable conditions of professional tone.\r\n\r\nConcerning the vice-admiral's action at this time, which had its share\r\nin the ruin of these captains, another curious instance of men's bondage\r\nto the order of battle transpires. The three rear ships of his squadron\r\nwere clean, that is, relatively fast; and they were rearmost for this\r\nvery reason of speed, because, when the division led on the other tack,\r\nthey, as headmost ships of the fleet, would be ready to chase.\r\nNevertheless, when the admiral sent to Lestock in the forenoon to hurry\r\nhim into line, no order was given to these ships to press ahead. Why?\r\nLestock answers that to send those ships ahead, out of the place in the\r\nline prescribed to them by the commander-in-chief, was breaking the\r\nline, which should expose him to condign punishment; and this opinion\r\nthe Court also adopts: \"The [only] messages sent to the Vice-Admiral by\r\nthe Admiral's two lieutenants were to make what sail he possibly could,\r\nand to close the line with his division; no signal was made for him to\r\nchase with his division, or send ships of his division to chase; without\r\nwhich, _while the signal for the line of battle was flying_, and more\r\nespecially after the messages brought him, he could not, _without breach\r\nof duty_, either have chased or sent ships to chase out of the line.\" It\r\nis to be noted that the word \"chase\" is here used in the strictest\r\ntechnical sense, not merely to exclude Lestock from diverting a ship to\r\nsome other purpose than that of the engagement, but even from shifting\r\nher place in the general order in the view of furthering the engagement;\r\nfor the Court says again: \"The Vice-Admiral could not send any ships of\r\nhis division to the relief of the _Namur_ and _Marlborough without\r\nbreaking the order of battle_, there being four ships of the Admiral's\r\ndivision\" (to wit, the _Dorsetshire_ and that crowd) \"stationed between\r\nthe Vice-Admiral's division and the _Marlborough_, which four ships\r\nmight have gone to the assistance of the _Marlborough_.\"\r\n\r\nThe second in command thus had no liberty to repair either the\r\noversights of his superior, or the results of obvious bad conduct in\r\njuniors; for Burrish's backwardness was observed throughout the rear.\r\nThere was a long road yet to travel to Nelson's personal action at St.\r\nVincent and Copenhagen, or to his judicious order at Trafalgar, \"The\r\nSecond in command will, after my intentions are made known to him, have\r\nthe entire direction of his line.\" Even that great officer Hood, off the\r\nChesapeake in 1781, felt himself tied hand and foot by the union flag at\r\nthe mizzen peak,--the signal for the line. Only the commander-in-chief\r\ncould loose the bonds; either by his personal initiative alone, and\r\nvigilant supervision, as did Hawke and Rodney, or by adding to this the\r\nbroad view of discretion in subordinates which Nelson took. Before\r\nleaving this subject, note may be taken of a pettifogging argument\r\nadvanced by Lestock and adopted by the Court, that orders to these three\r\nships to press ahead would have resulted in nothing, because of the\r\nlightness of the wind then and afterwards. True, doubtless, and known\r\nafter the fact; but who before the event could predict the uncertain\r\nMediterranean breeze, or how much each foot gained might contribute to\r\nthe five minutes which measure the interval between victory and defeat.\r\nIt is not by such lagging hesitations that battles are won.\r\n\r\nIt is a trivial coincidence, though it may be noted in passing, that as\r\nit was the second astern of the commander-in-chief on whom fell the\r\nweight of the disgrace, so it was the second astern of the commander of\r\nthe van who alone scored a distinct success, and achieved substantial\r\ngain of professional reputation. Hawke, at first bearing down, had come\r\nto close action with the Spanish _Neptuno_, a vessel nominally of less\r\nforce than his own ship, the _Berwick_. The _Neptuno_ was at length\r\ndriven out of her line, with a loss of some two hundred killed and\r\nwounded. Thus left without an immediate antagonist, Hawke's attention\r\nwas attracted by another Spanish vessel, the _Poder_, of the same\r\nnominal force as the _Neptuno_, and following her in the order; with\r\nwhich four or five of the seven British ships, that should have closed\r\nthe interval between Mathews and Rowley, were carrying on a distant and\r\ncircumspect engagement, resembling in caution that of the _Dorsetshire_\r\nand her followers. He carried the _Berwick_ close alongside the new\r\nenemy, dismasted her, and after two hours compelled her to strike her\r\nflag; the only vessel in either fleet that day to surrender, and then\r\nonly after a resistance as honorable to Spain as that of the\r\n_Marlborough_ had been to Great Britain. Her commander refused to yield\r\nhis sword to any but Hawke, who also took possession of the prize with a\r\nparty from his own ship; thus establishing beyond dispute, by all\r\ncustomary formalities, his claim to the one trophy of the day. The\r\noccurrences through which she was afterwards lost to the British, so\r\nthat only the honor of the capture remained, and that to Hawke alone,\r\nmust be briefly told; for they, too, are a part of the mismanagement\r\nthat has given to this battle its particular significance in naval\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAs the unlucky fire-ship bore down, Mathews began wearing the\r\n_Namur_,--turning her round, that is, from the wind, and therefore\r\ntowards the _Marlborough_ and her opponents. In this he seems to have\r\nhad first in view supporting the fire-ship and covering the\r\n_Marlborough_. Boats were ahead of the latter towing her from the enemy.\r\nAs she was thus being dragged off, but after the fire-ship blew up, the\r\n_Namur_ passed between her and the hostile line; then, hauling to the\r\nwind on the starboard tack, she stood north towards Lestock's division.\r\nThis movement to the rear was imitated by the British ships of the\r\ncentre,--the _Dorsetshire_ and others,--and, beyond a brush with the\r\nrear five Spanish vessels as they came up, the action in the centre here\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nThis retrograde movement of Mathews and his division drew the centre\r\naway from the van. At about the same time the allied van, composed\r\nwholly of French ships, seeing the straits of the _Poder_ and the\r\n_Real_, tacked--turned round--to come down to their assistance. This\r\nimposed a like movement upon the British van, lest it should be engaged\r\napart from the rest of the fleet, and perhaps doubled on, by a number of\r\nperfectly fresh ships. The _Poder_, having lost her chief spars, could\r\nnot be carried off, nor was Hawke able even to remove the men he had\r\nthrown on board. She was therefore retaken by the French. Lieutenant\r\nLloyd, the officer in charge, escaped with a part of the prize crew,\r\ntaking with him also a number of Spanish prisoners; but a junior\r\nlieutenant and some seamen were left behind and captured. The _Berwick_\r\nbeing compelled to follow her division, Lloyd could not rejoin her till\r\nthe following day, and sought refuge for that night on board another\r\nship.\r\n\r\nThe next day, February 23d, Mathews had another chance. As he did not\r\npursue during the night, while the allies continued to retire, he was a\r\nlong way off at daylight; but his fleet was now united, and the enemy\r\nretreating. He need therefore have no anxiety about the crippled\r\n_Marlborough_, but could follow freely; whereas, the enemy being\r\npursued, their injured ships both retarded the movement and were\r\nendangered. In the course of the day, the _Poder_ had lagged so far\r\nbehind that Admiral Rowley, who had recognized Hawke's enterprise the\r\nday before, directed him to move down upon her. As he approached, the\r\nFrench ship in company abandoned her, but in taking possession Hawke was\r\nanticipated by the _Essex_, which Mathews himself had ordered to do so.\r\nThe captain of the _Essex_ got hold of the Spanish flag, with some other\r\nsmall trophies, which he afterwards refused to give up unless compelled;\r\nand, as Mathews would not give an order, Hawke never got them. Thus\r\ncuriously it came to pass that the one man who above several\r\nmisdemeanants distinguished himself by bad conduct, amounting to\r\ncowardice, and who ran away to escape trial, kept the tokens of the\r\nsingle achievement of the day from him whose valor had won them. The\r\n_Poder_ herself was set on fire, and destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe British fleet continued to follow during the 23d, and at nightfall\r\nwas within three or four miles of the enemy, when Mathews again stopped.\r\nThe allies, continuing to withdraw, were next morning nearly out of\r\nsight, and further pursuit was abandoned.\r\n\r\nThus ended this almost forgotten affair, which in its day occasioned to\r\nan unusual degree the popular excitement and discussion which always\r\nfollow marked disaster, and but rarely attend success. Besides the\r\nparticular missteps of Lestock and the individual captains, which have\r\nbeen mentioned, Mathews's conduct was marked by serious failures in\r\nprofessional competency. The charge preferred against him which seems\r\nmost to have attracted attention, and to have been considered most\r\ndamaging, was taking his fleet into action in a confused and disorderly\r\nmanner. It is significant of professional standards that this should\r\nhave assumed such prominence; for, however faulty may have been his\r\nprevious management, the most creditable part of his conduct was the\r\nmanner of his attack. He did not wait for a pedantically accurate line,\r\nbut by a straightforward onslaught, at a favorable moment, upon a part\r\nof the enemy,--and that the rear,--set an example which, had it been\r\nfollowed by all who could do so, would probably have resulted in a\r\ndistinct and brilliant success. He was justified--if he reasoned at\r\nall--in expecting that Lestock could get into action as soon as the\r\nFrench van; or, at the least, before it could reverse the conditions\r\nwhich would have ensued from a vigorous encounter upon the lines of\r\nMathews's attack. It is most doubtful, indeed, whether the French van\r\nwould have ventured to engage, in the case supposed; for the French\r\nadmiral, writing to the French ambassador in Spain, used these words:\r\n\"It is clear, in the situation I was in, it could not be expected that a\r\nFrench admiral should go to the assistance of the Spaniards; neither\r\ncould the vanguard of the fleet do it without running the hazard of\r\nbeing surrounded by the vanguard of the English, which had the wind of\r\nthem; but _as soon as the English left me_ I drew together all the ships\r\nof both squadrons, and sailed immediately to the assistance of the _Real\r\nFelipe_, in doing which I was exposed to the fire of the whole English\r\nline; but happily the English did not punish my _rashness_ as it\r\ndeserved.\" Evidently De Court shared to the full the professional\r\ncaution which marked the French naval officers, with all their personal\r\ncourage; for if it was rash to pass the hostile line after it wore, it\r\nwould be reckless to do so before.\r\n\r\nConsidered simply as a tactical situation, or problem, quite independent\r\nof any tactical forethought or insight on the part of the\r\ncommander-in-chief,--of which there is little indication,--the\r\nconditions resulting from his attack were well summed up in a\r\ncontemporary publication, wholly adverse to Mathews in tone, and\r\nsaturated with the professional prepossessions embodied in the Fighting\r\nInstructions. This writer, who claims to be a naval officer, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The whole amount of this fight is that the centre, consisting of\r\n     eleven ships-of-the-line, together with two of-the-line and two\r\n     fifty-gun ships of the Rear-Admiral's division [the van], _were\r\n     able to destroy_ the whole Spanish squadron, much more so as three\r\n     of those ships went on with the French [the allied van], and four\r\n     of the sternmost did not get up with their admiral before it was\r\n     darkish, long after the fire-ship's misfortune, so that the whole\r\n     afternoon there were only five, out of which the _Constante_ was\r\n     beat away in less than an hour; what then fifteen ships could be\r\n     doing from half an hour past one till past five, no less than four\r\n     hours, and these ships not taken, burnt, and destroyed, is the\r\n     question which behooves them to answer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn brief, then, Mathews's attack was so delivered that the weight of\r\nthirteen of-the-line fell upon five Spanish of the same class, the\r\ndiscomfiture of which, actually accomplished even under the misbehavior\r\nof several British ships, separated the extreme rear, five other Spanish\r\nvessels, from the rest of the allies. Whatever the personal merit or\r\nlack of merit on the part of the commander-in-chief, such an\r\nopportunity, pushed home by a \"band of brothers,\" would at the least\r\nhave wiped out these rear ten ships of the allies; nor could the\r\nremainder in the van have redeemed the situation. As for the method of\r\nattack, it is worthy of note that, although adopted by Mathews\r\naccidentally, it anticipated, not only the best general practice of a\r\nlater date, but specifically the purpose of Rodney in the action which\r\nhe himself considered the most meritorious of his whole career,--that of\r\nApril 17, 1780. The decisive signal given by him on that occasion, as\r\nexplained by himself, meant that each ship should steer, not for the\r\nship corresponding numerically to her in the enemy's order, but for the\r\none immediately opposite at the time the signal was made. This is what\r\nMathews and his seconds did, and others should have imitated. Singularly\r\nenough, not only was the opportunity thus created lost, but there is no\r\ntrace of its existence, even, being appreciated in such wise as to\r\naffect professional opinion. As far as Mathews himself was concerned,\r\nthe accounts show that his conduct, instead of indicating tactical\r\nsagacity, was a mere counsel of desperation.\r\n\r\nBut after engaging he committed palpable and even discreditable\r\nmistakes. Hauling to windward--away--when the _Marlborough_ forced him\r\nahead, abandoned that ship to overwhelming numbers, and countenanced the\r\nirresolution of the _Dorsetshire_ and others. Continuing to stand north,\r\nafter wearing on the evening of the battle, was virtually a retreat,\r\nunjustified by the conditions; and it would seem that the same false\r\nstep gravely imperilled the _Berwick_, Hawke holding on, most properly,\r\nto the very last moment of safety, in order to get back his prize-crew.\r\nBringing-to on the night of the 23d was an error of the same character\r\nas standing north during that of the 22d. It was the act of a doubtful,\r\nirresolute man,--irresolute, not because a coward, but because wanting\r\nin the self-confidence that springs from conscious professional\r\ncompetency. In short, the commander-in-chief's unfitness was graphically\r\nportrayed in the conversation with Cornwall from the quarter gallery of\r\nthe flag-ship. \"If you approve and will go down with me, I will go\r\ndown.\" Like so many men, he needed a backer, to settle his doubts and to\r\nstiffen his backbone. The instance is far from unique.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Byng, as of Mathews, we are not concerned with the\r\ngeneral considerations of the campaign to which the battle was\r\nincidental. It is sufficient to note that in Minorca, then a British\r\npossession, the French had landed an army of 15,000 men, with siege\r\nartillery sufficient to reduce the principal port and fortress, Port\r\nMahon; upon which the whole island must fall. Their communications with\r\nFrance depended upon the French fleet cruising in the neighborhood.\r\nSerious injury inflicted upon it would therefore go far to relieve the\r\ninvested garrison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of Byng's Action off Minorca, May 20, 1756]\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: This illustration shows on a map the positions of\r\nthe fleets and their ships at various times in the action.  Critical\r\npositions on the map are marked with codes such as \"B1\" and \"F2\",\r\nwhich will be referred to below in the text.  This illustration is\r\navailable in the HTML version of the e-book.]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the British fleet sighted Minorca on the 19th\r\nof May, 1756, and was attempting to exchange information with the\r\nbesieged, when the French fleet was seen in the southeast. Byng stood\r\ntowards it, abandoning for the time the effort to communicate. That\r\nnight both fleets manoeuvred for advantage of position with regard to\r\nthe wind. The next day, between 9 and 10 A.M., they came again in view\r\nof each other, and at 11 were about six miles apart, the French still to\r\nthe southeast, with a breeze at south-southwest to southwest. The\r\nBritish once more advanced towards them, close hauled on the starboard\r\ntack, heading southeasterly, the enemy standing on the opposite tack,\r\nheading westerly, both carrying sail to secure the weather gage (B1,\r\nF1). It appeared at first that the French would pass ahead of the\r\nBritish, retaining the windward position; but towards noon the wind\r\nchanged, enabling the latter to lie up a point or two higher (B2). This\r\nalso forced the bows of the several French vessels off their course, and\r\nput them out of a regular line of battle; that is, they could no longer\r\nsail in each other's wake (F2). Being thus disordered, they reformed on\r\nthe same tack, heading northwest, with the wind very little forward of\r\nthe beam. This not only took time, but lost ground to leeward, because\r\nthe quickest way to re-establish the order was for the mass of the fleet\r\nto take their new positions from the leewardmost vessel. When formed\r\n(F3), as they could not now prevent the British line from passing\r\nahead, they hove-to with their main-topsails aback,--stopped,--awaiting\r\nthe attack, which was thenceforth inevitable and close at hand.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of what has been stated, the British line (B2-B3)--more\r\nproperly, column--was passing ahead of the French (F2-F3), steering\r\ntowards their rear, in a direction in a general sense opposite to\r\ntheirs, but not parallel; that is, the British course made an angle, of\r\nbetween thirty and forty-five degrees, with the line on which their\r\nenemy was ranged. Hence, barring orders to the contrary,--which were not\r\ngiven,--each British ship was at its nearest to the enemy as she passed\r\ntheir van, and became more and more distant as she drew to the rear. It\r\nwould have been impossible to realize more exactly the postulate of the\r\n17th Article of the Fighting Instructions, which in itself voiced the\r\nideal conditions of an advantageous naval position for attack, as\r\nconceived by the average officer of the day; and, as though most\r\neffectually to demonstrate once for all how that sort of thing would\r\nwork, the adjunct circumstances approached perfection. The admiral was\r\nthoroughly wedded to the old system, without an idea of departing from\r\nit, and there was a fair working breeze with which to give it effect,\r\nfor the ships under topsails and foresail would go about three knots;\r\nwith top-gallant sails, perhaps over four. A fifty-gun ship, about the\r\nmiddle of the engagement, had to close her lower deck ports when she set\r\nher top-gallant sails on the wind, which had then freshened a little.\r\n\r\nThe 17th Article read thus: \"If the admiral see the enemy standing\r\ntowards him, and he has the wind of them, the van of the fleet is to\r\nmake sail till they come the length of the enemy's rear, and our rear\r\nabreast of the enemy's van; then he that is in the rear of our fleet is\r\nto tack first, and every ship one after another as fast as they can\r\nthroughout the whole line; and if the admiral will have the whole fleet\r\nto tack together, the sooner to put them in a posture of engaging the\r\nenemy, he will hoist\" a prescribed signal, \"and fire a gun; and whilst\r\nthey are in fight with the enemy the ships will keep at half a cable's\r\nlength--one hundred yards--one of the other.\" All this Byng aimed to do.\r\nThe conditions exactly fitted, and he exactly followed the rules, with\r\none or two slight exceptions, which will appear, and for which the Court\r\nduly censured him.\r\n\r\nWhen thus much had been done, the 19th Article in turn found its\r\npostulate realized, and laid down its corresponding instruction: \"If the\r\nadmiral and his fleet have the wind of the enemy, and they have\r\nstretched themselves in a line of battle, the van of the admiral's fleet\r\nis to _steer with_ the van of the enemy's, and there to engage with\r\nthem.\" The precise force of \"steer with\" is not immediately apparent to\r\nus to-day, nor does it seem to have been perfectly clear then; for the\r\nquestion was put to the captain of the flag-ship,--the heroic Gardiner,\r\n--\"You have been asked if the admiral did not express some uneasiness at\r\nCaptain Andrews\"--of the van ship in the action--\"not seeming to\r\nunderstand the 19th Article of the Fighting Instructions; Do not you\r\nunderstand that article to relate to our van particularly when the two\r\nfleets are [already] in a parallel line of battle to each other?\" (As\r\nTT, F3). _Answer_: \"I apprehended it in the situation\" [not parallel]\r\n\"we were in[1] if the word _For_ were instead of the word _With_, he\r\nwould, I apprehend, have steered directly _for_ the van ship of the\r\nEnemy.\" _Question_. \"As the 19th Article expresses to steer with the van\r\nof the enemy, if the leading ship had done so, in the oblique line we\r\nwere in with the enemy, and every ship had observed it the same, would\r\nit not have prevented our rear coming to action at all, at least within\r\na proper distance?\" _Answer_: \"Rear, and van too.\" \"Steer with\"\r\ntherefore meant, to the Court and to Gardiner, to steer parallel to the\r\nenemy,--possibly likewise abreast,--and if the fleets were already\r\nparallel the instruction would work; but neither the articles\r\nthemselves, nor Byng by his signals, did anything to effect parallelism\r\nbefore making the signal to engage.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the ship sternmost in passing, which became the van when\r\nthe fleet tacked together according to the Instructions and signals,\r\nevidently shared Gardiner's impression; when about, he steered parallel\r\nto--\"with\"--the French, who had the wind nearly abeam. The mischief was\r\nthat the ships ahead of him in passing were successively more and more\r\ndistant from the enemy, and if they too, after tacking, steered with the\r\nlatter, they would never get any nearer. The _impasse_ is clear. Other\r\nmeasures doubtless would enable an admiral to range his fleet parallel\r\nto the enemy at any chosen distance, by taking a position himself and\r\nforming the fleet on his ship; or, in this particular instance, Byng\r\nbeing with the van as it, on the starboard tack, was passing the enemy\r\n(B3 B3), could at any moment have brought his fleet parallel to the\r\nFrench by signalling the then van ship to keep away a certain amount,\r\nthe rest following in her wake. Nothing to that effect being in the\r\nInstructions, it seems not to have occurred to him. His one idea was to\r\nconform to them, and he apprehended that after tacking, as they\r\nprescribed, the new van ship would bear down and engage without further\r\norders, keeping parallel to the French when within point-blank, the\r\nothers following her as they could; a process which, from the varying\r\ndistances, would expose each to a concentrated fire as they successively\r\napproached. Byng's action is only explicable to the writer by supposing\r\nthat he thus by \"steer with\" understood \"steer for;\" for when, after the\r\nfleet tacked together, the new van ship (formerly the rear) did not of\r\nher own motion head for the leading enemy, he signalled her to steer one\r\npoint, and then two points, in that direction. This, he explained in his\r\ndefence, was \"to put the leading captain in mind of his Instructions,\r\nwho I perceived did not steer away with the enemy's leading ship\r\nagreeable to the 19th Article of the Fighting Instructions.\" The results\r\nof these orders not answering his expectations, he then made the signal\r\nto engage, as the only remaining way perceptible to him for carrying out\r\nthe Instructions.\r\n\r\nTo summarize the foregoing, up to the moment the signal for battle was\r\nmade: While the fleets were striving for the weather gage, the wind had\r\nshifted to the southwest. The French, momentarily disordered by the\r\nchange, had formed in line ahead about noon, heading northwest,\r\nwesterly, so as just to keep their main topsails aback and the ships\r\nwith bare steerage way, but under command (F3). The British standing\r\nsouth-southeast, by the wind, were passing (B2-B3) across the\r\nhead of the enemy's fleet at a distance of from three to two miles--the\r\nlatter being the estimate by their ships then in the rear. The French\r\nhaving twelve vessels in line and the British thirteen, the gradual\r\nprogress of the latter should bring their then van \"the length of the\r\nenemy's rear,\" about the time the rear came abreast of his van. When\r\nthis happened, the Instructions required that the fleet tack together,\r\nand then stand for the enemy, ship to ship, number one to number one,\r\nand so along the line till the number twelves met[2].\r\n\r\nThis Byng purposed to do, but, unluckily for himself, ventured on a\r\nrefinement. Considering that, if his vessels bore down when abreast\r\ntheir respective antagonists, they would go bows-on, perpendicularly,\r\nsubject to a raking--enfilading--fire, he deferred the signal to tack\r\ntill his van had passed some distance beyond the French rear, because\r\nthus they would have to approach in a slanting direction. He left out of\r\nhis account here the fact that all long columns tend to straggle in the\r\nrear; hence, although he waited till his three or four leading ships had\r\npassed the enemy before making signal to tack, the rear had got no\r\nfarther than abreast the hostile van. Two of the clearest witnesses,\r\nBaird of the _Portland_, next to the then rear ship, and Cornwall of the\r\n_Revenge_, seventh from it, testified that, after tacking together, to\r\nthe port tack, when they kept away for the enemy in obedience to the\r\nsignal for battle, it was necessary, in order to reach their particular\r\nopponents, to bring the wind not only as far as astern, but on the\r\nstarboard quarter, showing that they had been in rear of their station\r\nbefore tacking, and so too far ahead after it; while Durell of the\r\n_Trident_, ninth from rear and therefore fifth from van, asserted that\r\nat the same moment the British van, which after tacking became the rear,\r\nhad overpassed the enemy by five or six ships. This may be an\r\nexaggeration, but that three or four vessels had gone beyond is proved\r\nby evidence from the ships at that end of the line.\r\n\r\nThe Court therefore distinctly censured the admiral for this novelty:\r\n\"Unanimously, the Court are of opinion that when the British fleet on\r\nthe starboard tack were stretched abreast, _or about the beam_ of the\r\nenemy's line, the admiral should have tacked the fleet all together, and\r\nimmediately have conducted it on a direct course for the enemy, the van\r\nsteering for the enemy's van,\" etc. The instructive point, however, is\r\nnot Byng's variation, nor the Court's censure, but the idea, common to\r\nboth, that the one and only way to use your dozen ships under the\r\nconditions was to send each against a separate antagonist. The highest\r\nand authoritative conception of a fleet action was thus a dozen naval\r\nduels, occurring simultaneously, under initial conditions unfavorable to\r\nthe assailant. It is almost needless to remark that this is as contrary\r\nto universal military teaching as it was to the practice of Rodney,\r\nHowe, Jervis, and Nelson, a generation or two later.\r\n\r\nThis is, in fact, the chief significance of this action, which ratified\r\nand in a measure closed the effete system to which the middle eighteenth\r\ncentury had degraded the erroneous, but comparatively hearty, tradition\r\nreceived by it from the seventeenth. It is true, the same blundering\r\nmethod was illustrated in the War of 1778. Arbuthnot and Graves,\r\ncaptains when Byng was tried, followed his plan in 1781, with like\r\ndemonstration of practical disaster attending false theory; but, while\r\nthe tactical inefficiency was little less, the evidence of faint-hearted\r\nprofessional incompetency, of utter personal inadequacy, was at least\r\nnot so glaring. It is the combination of the two in the person of the\r\nsame commander that has given to this action its pitiful pre-eminence in\r\nthe naval annals of the century.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, not so much to point out the lesson, as to reinforce\r\nits teaching by the exemplification of the practical results, that there\r\nis advantage in tracing the sequel of events in this battle. The signal\r\nto tack was made when the British van had reached beyond the enemy's\r\nrear, at a very little after 1 P.M. (B3). This reversed the line of\r\nbattle, the rear becoming the van, on the port tack. When done, the new\r\nvan was about two miles from that of the French (F4); the new rear,\r\nin which Byng was fourth from sternmost, was three and a half or four\r\nfrom their rear. Between this and 2 P.M. came the signals for the ship\r\nthen leading to keep two points, twenty-five degrees, more to starboard,\r\n--towards the enemy; a measure which could only have the bad effect of\r\nincreasing the angle which the British line already made with that of\r\nthe French, and the consequent inequality of distance to be traversed by\r\ntheir vessels in reaching their opponents. At 2.20 the signal for battle\r\nwas made, and was repeated by the second in command, Rear-Admiral Temple\r\nWest, who was in the fourth ship from the van. His division of six bore\r\nup at once and ran straight down before the wind, under topsails only,\r\nfor their several antagonists; the sole exception being the van-most\r\nvessel, which took the slanting direction desired by Byng, with the\r\nconsequence that she got ahead of her position, had to back and to wear\r\nto regain it, and was worse punished than any of her comrades. The\r\nothers engaged in line, within point-blank, the rear-admiral hoisting\r\nthe flag for close action (B4). Fifteen minutes later, the sixth ship,\r\nand rearmost of the van, the _Intrepid_, lost her foretopmast, which\r\ncrippled her.\r\n\r\nThe seventh ship, which was the leader of the rear, Byng's own division,\r\ngot out of his hands before he could hold her. Her captain, Frederick\r\nCornwall, was nephew to the gallant fellow who fell backing Mathews so\r\nnobly off Toulon, and had then succeeded to the command of the\r\n_Marlborough_, fighting her till himself disabled. He had to bring the\r\nwind on the starboard quarter of his little sixty-four, in order to\r\nreach the seventh in the enemy's line, which was an eighty-gun ship,\r\ncarrying the flag of the French admiral. This post, by professional\r\netiquette, as by evident military considerations, Byng owed to his own\r\nflag-ship, of equal force.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the rear division the commander-in-chief attempted to carry\r\nwith himself, slanting down; or, as the naval term then had it,\r\n\"lasking\" towards the enemy. The flag-ship kept away four\r\npoints--forty-five degrees; but hardly had she started, under the very\r\nmoderate canvas of topsails and foresail, to cover the much greater\r\ndistance to be travelled, in order to support the van by engaging the\r\nenemy's rear, when Byng observed that the two ships on his left--towards\r\nthe van--were not keeping pace with him. He ordered the main and mizzen\r\ntopsails to be backed to wait for them. Gardiner, the captain, \"took the\r\nliberty of offering the opinion\" that, if sail were increased instead of\r\nreduced, the ships concerned would take the hint, that they would all be\r\nsooner alongside the enemy, and probably receive less damage in going\r\ndown. It was a question of example. The admiral replied, \"You see that\r\nthe signal for the line is out, and I am ahead of those two ships; and\r\nyou would not have me, as admiral of the fleet, run down as if I was\r\ngoing to engage a single ship. It was Mr. Mathews's misfortune to be\r\nprejudiced by not carrying his force down together, which I shall\r\nendeavor to avoid.\" Gardiner again \"took the liberty\" of saying he would\r\nanswer for one of the two captains doing his duty. The incident, up to\r\nthe ship gathering way again, occupied less than ten minutes; but with\r\nthe van going down headlong--as it ought--one ceases to wonder at the\r\nimpression on the public produced by one who preferred lagging for\r\nlaggards to hastening to support the forward, and that the populace\r\nsuspected something worse than pedantry in such reasoning at such a\r\nmoment. When way was resumed, it was again under the very leisurely\r\ncanvas of topsails and foresail.\r\n\r\nBy this had occurred the incident of the _Intrepid_ losing her\r\nforetopmast. It was an ordinary casualty of battle, and one to be\r\nexpected; but to such a temper as Byng's, and under the cast-iron\r\nregulations of the Instructions, it entailed consequences fatal to\r\nsuccess in the action,--if success were ever attainable under such a\r\nmethod,--and was ultimately fatal to the admiral himself. The wreck of\r\nthe fallen mast was cleared, and the foresail set to maintain speed,\r\nbut, despite all, the _Intrepid_ dropped astern in the line. Cornwall in\r\nthe _Revenge_ was taking his place at the moment, and fearing that the\r\n_Intrepid_ would come back upon him, if in her wake, he brought up first\r\na little to windward, on her quarter; then, thinking that she was\r\nholding her way, he bore up again. At this particular instant he looked\r\nbehind, and saw the admiral and other ships a considerable distance\r\nastern and to windward; much Lestock's position in Mathews's action.\r\nThis was the stoppage already mentioned, to wait for the two other\r\nships. Had Cornwall been Burrish, he might in this have seen occasion\r\nfor waiting himself; but he saw rather the need of the crippled ship.\r\nThe _Revenge_ took position on the _Intrepid's_ lee quarter, to support\r\nher against the enemy's fire, concentrated on her when her mast was seen\r\nto fall. As her way slackened, the _Revenge_ approached her, and about\r\nfifteen minutes later the ship following, the _Princess Louisa_,--one of\r\nthose for which Byng had waited,--loomed up close behind Cornwall, who\r\nexpected her to run him on board, her braces being shot away. She\r\nmanaged, however, with the helm to back her sails, and dropped clear;\r\nbut in so doing got in the way of the vessel next after her, the\r\n_Trident_, which immediately preceded Byng. The captain of the\r\n_Trident_, slanting down with the rest of the division, saw the\r\nsituation, put his helm up, ran under the stern of the _Louisa_, passed\r\non her lee side,--nearest the enemy,--and ranged up behind the\r\n_Revenge_; but in doing this he not only crossed the stern of the\r\n_Louisa_, but the bow of the admiral's ship--the _Ramillies_.\r\n\r\nUnder proper management the _Ramillies_ doubtless could have done just\r\nwhat the _Trident_ did,--keep away with the helm, till the ships ahead\r\nof her were cleared; she would be at least hasting towards the enemy.\r\nBut the noise of battle was in the air, and the crew of the _Ramillies_\r\nbegan to fire without orders, at an improper distance. The admiral\r\npermitted them to continue, and the smoke enveloping the ship prevented\r\nfully noting the incidents just narrated. It was, however, seen before\r\nthe firing that the _Louisa_ was come up into the wind with her topsails\r\nshaking, and the _Trident_ passing her to leeward. There should,\r\ntherefore, have been some preparation of mind for the fact suddenly\r\nreported to the admiral, by a military passenger on the quarter deck,\r\nthat a British ship was close aboard, on the lee bow. It was the\r\n_Trident_ that had crossed from windward to leeward for the reasons\r\ngiven, and an instant later the _Louisa_ was seen on the weather bow.\r\nInstead of keeping off, as the _Trident_ had done, the admiral ordered\r\nthe foresail hauled up, the helm down, luffed the ship to the wind, and\r\nbraced the fore-topsail sharp aback; the effect of which was first to\r\nstop her way, and then to pay her head off to leeward, clear of the two\r\nvessels. About quarter of an hour elapsed, by Captain Gardiner's\r\nevidence, from the time that the _Ramillies's_ head pointed clear of the\r\n_Trident_ and _Louisa_ before sail was again made to go forward to aid\r\nthe van. The battle was already lost, and in fact had passed out of\r\nByng's control, owing to his previous action; nevertheless this further\r\ndelay, though probably due only to the importance attached by the\r\nadmiral to regularity of movement, had a discreditable appearance.\r\n\r\nThe Court held that the admiral was justified in not trying to go to\r\nleeward of the two ships, under the circumstances when they were seen;\r\nbut blamed him for permitting the useless cannonade which prevented\r\nseeing them sooner. The results at this moment in other parts of the\r\nfield should be summarized, as they show both the cause and the\r\ncharacter of the failures due to faulty management.\r\n\r\nThe five ships of the British van had already seen their adversaries\r\nwithdraw after a sharp engagement. This seems to have been due to the\r\nfact that two were individually overmatched and driven off; whereupon\r\nthe other three retired because unable to contend with five. But no\r\nsupport reached the British van at this important moment; on the\r\ncontrary, the British rear was now two or three miles distant, astern\r\nand to windward. The lagging of the crippled _Intrepid_ held back the\r\n_Revenge_. Cornwall was detained some time by the old idea that he\r\nneeded a signal to pass her, because to do so was breaking the order\r\nestablished by the admiral; but concluding at last that Byng was unaware\r\nof the conditions, and seeing that his immediate opponent--the French\r\nadmiral--was drawing ahead, he sent word to the _Intrepid_ to hold her\r\nfire for a few moments till he could go by. He then made sail.\r\n\r\nThe French rear with its commander-in-chief had been watching the\r\nincidents narrated: the crippling of the _Intrepid_, the consequent\r\ndisorder in the British rear, and the increasing distance between it and\r\nthe van. When the _Revenge_, however, passed ahead, and Byng\r\ndisentangled his flag-ship, the moment for a decisive step arrived. The\r\nFrench rear vessels were nearer the British van than Byng's division\r\nwas. They now filled their topsails, made more sail, stood for the\r\nBritish leading ships, already partially unrigged, passed by, and in so\r\ndoing gave them the fire of a number of substantially fresh vessels,\r\nwhich had undergone only a distant and ineffective cannonade. Byng saw\r\nwhat was about to happen, and also set more canvas; but it was no longer\r\npossible to retrieve the preceding errors. The French admiral had it in\r\nhis power very seriously to damage, if not to destroy the hostile van;\r\nbut in accordance with the tradition of his nation he played an\r\nover-prudent game, strictly defensive, and kept too far off. After\r\nexchanging distant broadsides, he steered northwest towards Mahon,\r\nsatisfied that he had for the time disabled his opponent. The British\r\nthat evening tacked off-shore and stood to the southeast. Four days\r\nlater they abandoned the field, returning to Gibraltar. The fall of\r\nMinorca followed.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been much worse than the deplorable management of\r\nthis action on the part of the commander-in-chief. It is a conspicuous\r\ninstance of weak and halting execution, superimposed upon a professional\r\nconception radically erroneous; and it reflected throughout the timid\r\nhesitancy of spirit which dictated the return to Gibraltar, under the\r\nalways doubtful sanction of a Council of War. But the historical value\r\nof the lesson is diminished if attention is confined to the shortcomings\r\nof the admiral, neglectful of the fact that his views as to the\r\nnecessity to observe the routine of the Fighting Instructions are\r\nreproduced in the evidence of the captains; and that the finding of the\r\nCourt censures, not the general idea, but certain details, important yet\r\nsecondary. Durell, being asked whether the admiral could not have passed\r\nunder the stern of the _Trident_, as the _Trident_ had under that of the\r\n_Louisa_, replies, \"Yes, but she would have been to leeward of those\r\nships ahead;\" that is, to leeward of the line. Gardiner \"knows no other\r\nmethod than what the admiral took, for preserving the line regular.\"\r\nCornwall cannot pass the _Intrepid_ without a signal, because it would\r\nbe breaking the order. These were all good men.\r\n\r\nThe Court, composed of four admirals and nine captains, the junior of\r\nwhom had over ten years seniority, give in their finding no shadow of\r\ndisapproval to the broad outlines of the action. There can be,\r\ntherefore, no doubt about service standards. The questions put to the\r\nwitnesses reveal indeed a distinct preference for forming the line of\r\nbattle _parallel_ to that of the enemy before bearing down, so that all\r\nthe ships may have the same distance to go, have a clear field ahead of\r\neach, and the comparatively simple mutual bearing of \"abeam\" to observe;\r\nbut it refrains from censuring the admiral for forming on a line very\r\noblique to that of the enemy, which entailed the burden of changing the\r\nrelative positions during standing down, so as to arrive all together,\r\non a line parallel to his; while the course itself being oblique alike\r\nto their own front and the enemy's, each preceding ship was liable to\r\nget in the way, \"to prove an impediment,\" to its follower,--as actually\r\nhappened. It was indeed impossible to fault the commander-in-chief in\r\nthis particular, because his action was conformable to the letter of the\r\nInstructions, with which he was evidently and subserviently eager to\r\ncomply.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Court therefore was, in substance, that in bearing\r\ndown upon the enemy Byng did not do wrong in starting upon a line\r\noblique to them; but that he should have steered such a course, and\r\nmaintained such spread of sail, graduated to the speed of the slowest\r\nship in the fleet, that all should reach point-blank range at the same\r\ntime, and be then ranged on a line parallel to that of the enemy. \"When\r\non the starboard tack, the admiral should have tacked the fleet all\r\ntogether and immediately conducted it on a direct course for the\r\nenemy; ... each ship steering for her opposite ship in the enemy's line,\r\nand under such sail as might have enabled the worst sailing ship, under\r\nall her plain sail, to preserve her station.\" It is needless to insist with\r\nany naval man, or to any soldier, that such an advance, in orderly\r\nfashion, oblique to the front, is unattainable except by long drill,\r\nwhile this fleet had been but a few weeks assembled; and the difficulty\r\nis enhanced when each ship has not only to keep its station in line, but\r\nto reach a particular enemy, who may not be just where he ought, having\r\nrespect to the British order. The manoeuvre favored by the Court for the\r\nfleet as a whole was in fact just that which Byng attempted for his own\r\ndivision, with the results that have been narrated. These were\r\naggravated by his mismanagement, but did not originate from it.\r\n\r\nThe invariable result of an attack thus attempted, however vigorously\r\nmade, was that the van of the assailant got into action first, receiving\r\nthe brunt of the enemy's fire without proper support. Not infrequently,\r\nit also underwent a second hammering from the enemy's rear, precisely in\r\nthe same way as occurred in Byng's action; and whether this happened or\r\nnot depended more upon the enemy than upon the British rear. In\r\nignoring, therefore, the idea of combining an attack in superior\r\nnumbers upon a part of the enemy, and adopting instead that of an\r\nonslaught upon his whole, all along the line, the British practice of\r\nthe eighteenth century not only surrendered the advantage which the\r\ninitiative has, of effecting a concentration, but subjected their own\r\nfleets to being beaten in detail, subject only to the skill of the\r\nopponent in using the opportunity extended to him. The results, at best,\r\nwere indecisive, tactically considered. The one apparent exception was\r\nin June, 1794, when Lord Howe, after long vainly endeavoring a better\r\ncombination with a yet raw fleet, found himself forced to the old\r\nmethod; but although then several ships were captured, this issue seems\r\nattributable chiefly to the condition of the French Navy, greatly fallen\r\nthrough circumstances foreign to the present subject. It was with this\r\nsystem that Rodney was about to break, the first of his century formally\r\nto do so. A false tactical standard, however, was not the only drawback\r\nunder which the British Navy labored in 1739. The prolonged series of\r\nwars, which began when the establishment of civil order under Cromwell\r\npermitted the nation to turn from internal strife to external interests,\r\nhad been for England chiefly maritime. They had recurred at brief\r\nintervals, and had been of such duration as to insure a continuity of\r\nexperience and development. Usage received modification under the\r\ninfluence of constant warlike practice, and the consequent changes in\r\nmethods, if not always thoroughly reasoned, at the least reflected a\r\nsimilar process of professional advance in the officers of the service.\r\nThis was consecutively transmitted, and by the movement of actual war\r\nwas prevented from stagnating and hardening into an accepted finality.\r\nThus the service and its officers, in the full performance of their\r\nfunctions, were alive and growing. Nor was this all. The same\r\nsurroundings that promoted this healthful evolution applied also a\r\ncontinual test of fitness to persons. As each war began, there were\r\nstill to be found in the prime of vigor and usefulness men whose\r\nefficiency had been proved in its predecessor, and thus the line of\r\nsustained ability in leadership was carried on from one naval generation\r\nto another, through the sixty-odd years, 1652-1713, over which these\r\nconditions extended.\r\n\r\nThe peace of Utrecht in 1713 put an end to this period. A disputed\r\nsuccession after the death of Queen Anne, in 1714, renewed the condition\r\nof internal disquietude which had paralyzed the external action of\r\nEngland under Charles I.; and this co-operated with the mere weariness\r\nof war, occasioned by prolonged strife, to give both the country and the\r\nnavy a temporary distaste to further military activity. The man of the\r\noccasion, who became the exponent and maintainer of this national\r\ninclination, was Sir Robert Walpole; to whom, during his ministry of\r\nover twenty years, can fairly be applied Jefferson's phrase concerning\r\nhimself, that his \"passion was peace.\" But, whatever the necessity to\r\nthe country of such a policy, it too often results, as it did in both\r\nthese cases, in neglect of the military services, allowing the equipment\r\nto decay, and tending to sap the professional interest and competency of\r\nthe officers.\r\n\r\nFrom this last evil the United States Navy in Jefferson's day was saved\r\nby the simple fact that the officers were young men, or at the most in\r\nthe early prime of life,--the Navy itself, in 1812, being less than\r\ntwenty years old as a corporate organization. The British Navy of 1739\r\nwas in very different case. For a quarter of a century the only\r\nimportant military occurrence had been the Battle of Cape Passaro, in\r\n1718, where the British fleet in a running fight destroyed a much\r\ninferior Spanish force; and the occasion then was not one of existent\r\nwar, but of casual hostilities, which, precipitated by political\r\nconditions, began and ended with the particular incident, as far as the\r\nsea was concerned. Back of this lay only Malaga, in 1704; for the\r\nremaining years of war, up to 1713, had been unmarked by fleet battles.\r\nThe tendency of this want of experience, followed by the long\r\nperiod--not of peace only, but--of professional depression resultant\r\nupon inactivity and national neglect, was to stagnation, to obviate\r\nwhich no provision existed or was attempted. Self-improvement was not a\r\nnote of the service, nor of the times. The stimulus of occupation and\r\nthe corrective of experience being removed, average men stuck where they\r\nwere, and grew old in a routine of service, or, what was perhaps worse,\r\nout of the service in all but name. In naval warfare, the Battle of\r\nMalaga, the last point of performance, remained the example, and the\r\nFighting Instructions the passively accepted authority. The men at the\r\nhead of the Navy, to whom the country naturally looked, either had no\r\nrecord--no proof of fitness--because but youths in the last war, or\r\nelse, in simple consequence of having then had a chance to show\r\nthemselves, were now superannuated. This very fact, however, had the\r\nsingular and unfortunate result that, because the officers of reputation\r\nwere old, men argued, by a curious perversion of thought, that none but\r\nthe old should be trusted.\r\n\r\nOf this two significant cases will tell more than many words. Mathews,\r\nwho commanded at Toulon in 1744, was then sixty-seven years old, and had\r\nnot been at sea between 1724 and 1742. Hawke, in 1747, when he had\r\nalready established an excellent reputation as a captain, and for\r\nenterprise in recent battle, was thought young to be entrusted with a\r\nsquadron of a dozen ships-of-the-line, although he was forty-two,--two\r\nyears older than Nelson at the Nile, but four years younger than\r\nNapoleon and Wellington at Waterloo, and one year less in age than Grant\r\nat the close of the American Civil War. Such instances are not of\r\nmerely curious interest; they are symptoms of professional states of\r\nmind, of a perplexity and perversion of standards which work\r\ndisastrously whenever war succeeds to a prolonged period of peace, until\r\nexperience has done its work by sorting out the unsound from among the\r\nfair-seeming, and has shown also that men may be too old as well as too\r\nyoung for unaccustomed responsibility. The later prevalence of juster\r\nviews was exemplified in the choice of Wolfe, who was but thirty-two\r\nwhen he fell before Quebec in 1759, charged with one of the most\r\ndifficult enterprises that had then been entrusted to a British general.\r\n\r\nIt is these two factors, therefore, an erroneous standard and a\r\nlethargic peace, which principally caused the weakness of the British\r\nofficial staff for battle service at the period of lowest descent, which\r\nwas reached in the first quarter of the eighteenth century, but was\r\nprolonged and intensified by a protracted interval of professional\r\napathy. Other grievous evils doubtless existed, serious defects in\r\nadministration, involving indifferent equipment, bad and scanty\r\nprovisions, inferior physique in the ships' companies, and wretched\r\nsanitary arrangements; but while all these unquestionably gravely\r\naffected general efficiency for war, they belonged rather to the civil\r\nthan the military side of the profession. In the hour of battle it was\r\nnot these, but the tone and efficiency of the officers, that chiefly\r\ntold. A false pattern of action had been accepted at a moment favorable\r\nto its perpetuation, when naval warfare on the grand scale had ceased,\r\nowing to the decline of the principal enemy, the navy of France; while\r\nthe average competency of naval officers had been much lowered through\r\nwant of professional incentive, and the absence of any sifting process\r\nby which the unfit could be surely eliminated. That plenty of good\r\nmaterial existed, was sufficiently shown by the number of names,\r\nafterwards distinguished, which soon began to appear. Weeding went on\r\napace; but before its work was done, there had to be traversed a painful\r\nperiod, fruitful of evidences of unfitness, of personal weakness, of low\r\nor false professional ideas.\r\n\r\nIt is with this period that we have first had to do as our point of\r\ndeparture, by which not only to estimate the nature and degree of the\r\nsubsequent advance, but to illustrate also the part specifically\r\ncontributed to it by Hawke and Rodney, through their personal and\r\nprofessional characteristics. While types, they are more than mere\r\nexponents of the change as a whole, and will be found to bear to it\r\nparticular relations,--its leaders in fact, as well as in name. It is\r\nnot merely fanciful to say that Hawke stands for and embodies the spirit\r\nof the new age, while Rodney rather exemplifies and develops the form in\r\nwhich that spirit needed ultimately to cloth itself in order to perfect\r\nits working. The one is a protest in act against the professional\r\nfaintheartedness, exaggerated into the semblance of personal timidity,\r\nshown by the captains off Toulon in 1774; the other, in the simple but\r\nskilful methods and combinations adopted by him, both represents and\r\ngives effect to a reaction against the extravagant pedantry, which it\r\nfell to Byng, in all the honesty of a thoroughly commonplace man, to\r\nexhibit in unintentional caricature.\r\n\r\nIn thus ascribing to these great men complementary parts in leading and\r\nshaping the general movement, it is not meant that either is deficient\r\non the side attributed to the other. Hawke showed by his actions that he\r\nwas by no means indifferent to tactical combinations, which is another\r\nway of saying that he appreciated the advantage of form in warfare;\r\nwhile Rodney, though a careful organizer and driller of fleets, and\r\npatient in effort to obtain advantage before attacking, exhibited on\r\noccasion headlong, though not inconsiderate, audacity, and also\r\ntenacious endurance in fight. Still, it will probably be admitted by the\r\nstudent of naval biography that to him Hawke suggests primarily the\r\nunhesitating sudden rush--the swoop--upon the prey, while Rodney\r\nresembles rather the patient astute watcher, carefully keeping his own\r\npowers in hand, and waiting for the unguarded moment when the adversary\r\nmay be taken suddenly at unawares. Certain it is that, with\r\nopportunities much more numerous than were permitted to Hawke, his\r\nsuccesses would have been far greater but for an excess of methodical\r\ncaution. There was a third, who combined in due proportion, and\r\npossessed to an extraordinary degree, the special qualities here\r\nassigned to each. It is one of the ironies of history that the first Sir\r\nSamuel Hood should have had just opportunity enough to show how great\r\nwere his powers, and yet have been denied the chance to exhibit them\r\nunder conditions to arrest the attention of the world; nay, have been\r\nmore than once compelled to stand by hopelessly, and see occasions lost\r\nwhich he would unquestionably have converted into signal triumphs. In\r\nhim, as far as the record goes, was consummated the advance of the\r\neighteenth century. He was the greatest of the sowers. It fell to\r\nNelson, his pupil,--in part at least,--to reap the harvest.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this part of our subject, the necessary preliminary to\r\nunderstanding the progress of naval warfare in the eighteenth century,\r\nit is pertinent to note the respect in which advance there differs from\r\nthat of the nineteenth, and in some degree, though less, from that of\r\nthe seventeenth centuries. The period was not one of marked material\r\ndevelopment. Improvements there were, but they were slow, small in\r\nultimate extent, and in no sense revolutionary. Ships and guns, masts\r\nand sails, grew better, as did also administrative processes; it may\r\nindeed be asserted, as an axiom of professional experience, that as the\r\nmilitary tone of the sea-officers rises, the effect will be transmitted\r\nto those civil functions upon which efficiency for war antecedently\r\ndepends. Still, substantially, the weapons of war were in principle, and\r\nconsequently in general methods of handling, the same at the end of the\r\nperiod as at the beginning. They were intrinsically more efficient; but\r\nthe great gain was not in them, but in the spirit and intellectual grasp\r\nof the men who wielded them. There was no change in the least analogous\r\nto that from oars to sails, or from sails to steam.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions of continued similarity in means, advance in the\r\npractice of any profession is effected rather in the realm of ideas, in\r\nintellectual processes; and even their expert application involves mind\r\nrather than matter. In the nineteenth century such intellectual\r\nprocesses have been largely devoted to the purposes of material\r\ndevelopment, and have found their realization, in the navy as elsewhere,\r\nin revolutionizing instruments, in providing means never before\r\nattainable. The railroad, the steamer, the electric telegraph, find\r\ntheir counterpart in the heavily armored steamship of war. But in\r\nutilizing these new means the navy must still be governed by the ideas,\r\nwhich are, indeed, in many ways as old as military history, but which in\r\nthe beginning of the eighteenth century had passed out of the minds of\r\nnaval men. It was the task of the officers of that period to recall\r\nthem, to formulate them anew, to give them a living hold upon the theory\r\nand practice of the profession. This they did, and they were undoubtedly\r\nhelped in so doing by the fact that their attention was not diverted and\r\nabsorbed, as that of our day very largely has been, by decisive changes\r\nin the instruments with which their ideas were to be given effect. Thus\r\nthey were able to make a substantial and distinctive contribution to the\r\nart of naval warfare, and that on its highest side. For the artist is\r\ngreater than his materials, the warrior than his arms; and it was in the\r\nman rather than in his weapons that the navy of the eighteenth century\r\nwrought its final conspicuous triumph.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This wording and punctuation is exact from the text.\r\n\r\n[2] So far was literalism carried, that, before the signal for battle,\r\nByng evened numbers with his opponent by directing his weakest ship to\r\nleave the line, with no other orders than to be ready to take the place\r\nof a disabled vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAWKE\r\n\r\n1705-1781\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first great name in British naval annals belonging distinctively to\r\nthe eighteenth century rather than to the seventeenth, is that of Edward\r\nHawke. He was born in 1705, of a family of no marked social distinction,\r\nhis father being a barrister, and his grandfather a London merchant. His\r\nmother's maiden name was Bladen. One of her brothers held an important\r\ncivil office as Commissioner of Trade and Plantations, and was for many\r\nyears a member of Parliament. Under the conditions which prevailed then,\r\nand for some generations longer, the influence attaching to such\r\npositions enabled the holder to advance substantially the professional\r\ninterests of a naval officer. Promotion in rank, and occupation both in\r\npeace and war, were largely a matter of favor. Martin Bladen naturally\r\nhelped his nephew in this way, a service especially valuable in the\r\nearlier part of a career, lifting a man out of a host of competitors and\r\ngiving him a chance to show what was in him. It may readily be believed\r\nthat Hawke's marked professional capacity speedily justified the\r\nadvantage thus obtained, and he seems to have owed his promotion to\r\npost-captain to a superior officer when serving abroad; though it is\r\nnever possible to affirm that even such apparent official recognition\r\nwas not due either to an intimation from home, or to the give and take\r\nof those who recognized Bismarck's motto, \"Do ut des.\"\r\n\r\nHowever this may have been, the service did not suffer by the favors\r\nextended to Hawke. Nor was his promotion unduly rapid, to the injury of\r\nprofessional character, as often happened when rank was prematurely\r\nreached. It was not till March 20, 1734, that he was \"made post,\" as the\r\nexpression went, by Sir Chaloner Ogle into the frigate _Flamborough_, on\r\nthe West India Station. Being then twenty-nine years old, in the prime\r\nof life for naval efficiency, he had reached the position in which a\r\nfair opportunity for all the honors of the profession lay open to him,\r\nprovided he could secure occupation until he was proved to be\r\nindispensable. Here also his uncle's influence stood good. Although the\r\nparty with which the experienced politician was identified had gone out\r\nof power with Sir Robert Walpole, in 1742, his position on the Board\r\ndealing with Colonial affairs left him not without friends. \"My\r\ncolleague, Mr. Cavendish,\" he writes, \"has already laid in his claim for\r\nanother ship for you. But after so long a voyage\" (he had been away over\r\nthree years) \"I think you should be allowed a little time to spend with\r\nyour friends on shore. It is some consolation, however, that I have some\r\nfriends on the new Board of Admiralty.\" \"There has been a clean sweep,\"\r\nhe says again, \"but I hope I may have some friends amongst the new Lords\r\nthat will upon my account afford you their protection.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in the beginning of 1743, when Hawke had just returned from a\r\nprotracted cruise on the West India and North American stations, where\r\nby far the greater part of his early service was passed. He never again\r\nreturned there, and very shortly after his uncle's letter, just quoted,\r\nhe was appointed to the _Berwick_, a ship-of-the-line of seventy guns.\r\nIn command of her he sailed in September, 1743, for the Mediterranean;\r\nand a few months after, by his decided and seamanlike course in\r\nMathews's action, he established his professional reputation and\r\nfortunes, the firm foundations of which had been laid during the\r\nprevious years of arduous but inconspicuous service. Two years later, in\r\n1746, Martin Bladen died, and with him political influence, in the\r\nordinary acceptation, departed from Hawke. Thenceforth professional\r\nmerit, forced upon men's recognition, stood him in stead.\r\n\r\nHe was thirty-nine when he thus first made his mark, in 1744. Prior to\r\nthis there is not found, in the very scanty records that remain of his\r\ncareer, as in that of all officers of his period while in subordinate\r\npositions, any certain proof that he had ever been seriously engaged\r\nwith an enemy. War against Spain had been declared, October 19, 1739. He\r\nhad then recently commissioned a fifty-gun ship, the _Portland_, and in\r\nher sailed for the West Indies, where he remained until the autumn of\r\n1742; but the inert manner in which Spain maintained the naval contest,\r\nnotwithstanding that her transmarine policy was the occasion of the\r\nquarrel, and her West Indian possessions obviously endangered, removed\r\nall chance of active service on the large scale, except in attacking her\r\ncolonies; and in none of those enterprises had the _Portland_ been\r\ncalled upon to share.\r\n\r\nMeantime, a general European war had begun in 1740, concerning the\r\nsuccession to the Austrian throne; and, in the political combinations\r\nwhich followed, France and Great Britain had as usual ranged themselves\r\non opposite sides, though without declaring war upon each other.\r\nFurther, there had existed for some time a secret defensive alliance\r\nbetween France and Spain, binding each party to support the other, under\r\ncertain conditions, with an effective armed force, to be used not for\r\naggressive purposes, but in defence only. It was claimed, indeed, that\r\nby so doing the supporting country was not to be considered as going to\r\nwar, or even as engaged in hostilities, except as regarded the\r\ncontingent furnished. This view received some countenance from\r\ninternational law, in the stage of development it had then reached; yet\r\nit is evident that if a British admiral met a Spanish fleet, of strength\r\nfairly matching his own, but found it accompanied by a French division,\r\nthe commander of which notified him that he had orders to fight if an\r\nattack were made, friendly relations between the two nations would be\r\nstrained near to the breaking point. This had actually occurred to the\r\nBritish Admiral Haddock, in the Mediterranean, in 1741; and conditions\r\nessentially similar, but more exasperated, constituted the situation\r\nunder which Hawke for the first time was brought into an action between\r\ntwo great fleets.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of January, 1744, when the _Berwick_ joined the British\r\nfleet, it had rendezvoused at the Hyères Islands, a little east of\r\nToulon, watching the movements of twelve Spanish ships-of-the-line,\r\nwhich had taken refuge in the port. As these were unwilling to put to\r\nsea trusting to their own strength, the French Admiral De Court was\r\nordered to accompany and protect them when they sailed. This becoming\r\nknown, Admiral Mathews had concentrated his fleet, which by successive\r\nreinforcements--the _Berwick_ among others--numbered twenty-eight\r\nof-the-line when the allies, in about equal force, began to come out on\r\nthe 20th of February.\r\n\r\nThe action which ensued owes its historical significance wholly to the\r\nfact that it illustrated conspicuously, and in more than one detail, the\r\ndegenerate condition of the official staff of the British navy; the\r\ndemoralization of ideals, and the low average of professional\r\ncompetency.[3] That there was plenty of good metal was also shown, but\r\nthe proportion of alloy was dangerously great. That the machinery of the\r\norganization was likewise bad, the administrative system culpably\r\nnegligent as well as inefficient, had been painfully manifested in the\r\nequipment of the ships, in the quality of the food, and in the\r\nindifferent character of the ships' crews; but in this respect Hawke had\r\nnot less to complain of than others, having represented forcibly to the\r\nAdmiralty the miserable unfitness of the men sent him. Nevertheless,\r\ndespite all drawbacks, including therein a signalling system so\r\nrudimentary and imperfect as to furnish a ready excuse to the unwilling,\r\nas well as a recurrent perplexity to those honestly wishing to obey\r\ntheir orders, he showed that good will and high purpose could not only\r\nlead a man to do his full duty as directed, but guide him to independent\r\ninitiative action when opportunity offered. Under all external\r\nconditions of difficulty and doubt, or even of cast-iron rule, the\r\nprinciple was as true then as when Nelson formulated it, that no captain\r\nwhen in doubt could do very wrong if he placed his ship alongside an\r\nenemy. That Hawke so realized it brought out into more glaring relief\r\nthe failure of so many of his colleagues on this occasion.\r\n\r\nBut the lesson would be in great part lost, if there were to be seen in\r\nthis lapse only the personal element of the delinquents, and not the\r\nwidespread decline of professional tone. Undoubtedly, of course, it is\r\ntrue that the personal equation, as always, made itself felt, but here\r\nas intensifying an evil which had its principal source elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHawke carried Nelson's maxim into effect. Upon the signal for battle he\r\ntook his own ship into close action with the antagonist allotted to him\r\nby the order of the fleet; but after beating her out of the line he\r\nlooked round for more work to do. Seeing then that several of the\r\nBritish vessels had not come within point-blank, but, through\r\nprofessional timidity, or over-cautious reverence for the line of\r\nbattle, were engaging at long range a single Spaniard, he quitted his\r\nown position, brought her also to close quarters, and after an obstinate\r\ncontest, creditable to both parties, forced her to surrender. She was\r\nthe only ship to haul down her flag that day, and her captain refused to\r\nsurrender his sword to any but Hawke, whom alone he accepted as his\r\nvanquisher.\r\n\r\nA generation or two later Hawke's conduct in this matter would have\r\ndrawn little attention; it would not have been exceptional in the days\r\nof St. Vincent and Nelson, nor even in that of Howe. At the time of its\r\noccurrence, it was not only in sharp contrast with much that happened\r\non the same field of battle, but it was somewhat contrary to rule. It\r\npossessed so far the merit of originality; and that on the right\r\nside,--the side of fighting. As in all active life, so in war a man is\r\nmore readily pardoned for effecting too much than too little; and it was\r\ndoubly so here, because it was evident from the behavior of his peers\r\nthat he must expect no backing in the extra work he took upon himself.\r\nTheir aloofness emphasized his forwardness; and the fact that through\r\nthe withdrawal of his admiral for the night, the prize was ultimately\r\nretaken, together with an officer and seamen he had placed on board,\r\nfixed still further attention upon the incident, in which Hawke's action\r\nwas the one wholly creditable feature.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the battle upon his fortunes was summed up in a phrase.\r\nWhen his first lieutenant was sent to report the loss of the prize-crew\r\nto Rear-Admiral Rowley, the commander of the division, the latter\r\nreplied, among other things, that \"he had not been well acquainted with\r\nCaptain Hawke before, but he should now be well acquainted with him from\r\nhis behavior.\" Like Nelson at St. Vincent, Hawke was now revealed, not\r\nto the navy only but to the nation,--\"through his behavior.\" Somewhat\r\nexceptionally, the king personally took knowledge of him, and stood by\r\nhim. George II. paid most interested attention to the particulars\r\nelicited by the Courts-Martial,--a fact which doubtless contributed to\r\nmake him so sternly unyielding in the case of Byng, twelve years later.\r\nTo the king Hawke became \"my captain;\" and his influence was directly\r\nused when, in a flag promotion in 1747, some in the Admiralty proposed\r\nto include Hawke in the retirement of senior captains, which was a\r\ncommon incident in such cases. \"I will not have Hawke 'yellowed,'\" was\r\nthe royal fiat; a yellow admiral being the current phrase for one set\r\naside from further active employment.\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances under which Hawke first received experience\r\nof the fighting conditions of the navy. Whatever his previous attitude\r\ntowards accepted traditions of professional practice, this no doubt\r\nloosened the fetters; for they certainly never constrained him in his\r\nsubsequent career. He remained in the Mediterranean fleet, generally\r\nupon detached services in command of divisions of ships, until the end\r\nof 1745. Returning then to England, he saw no further active service\r\nuntil he became a Rear-Admiral--of the White--on July 15, 1747.\r\n\r\nThe promotions being numerous, Hawke's seniority as captain carried him\r\nwell up the list of rear-admirals, and he was immediately employed;\r\nhoisting his flag July 22d. He then became second to Sir Peter Warren,\r\ncommander-in-chief of the \"Western Squadron.\" This cruised in the Bay of\r\nBiscay, from Ushant to Finisterre, to intercept the naval divisions,\r\nand the accompanying convoys of merchant and transport ships, with\r\nwhich the French were then seeking to maintain their colonial empire in\r\nNorth America and in India: an empire already sorely shaken, and\r\ndestined to fall finally in the next great war.\r\n\r\nHawke was now in the road of good luck, pure and unadulterated. His\r\nhappy action in capturing the _Poder_ illustrates indeed opportunity\r\nimproved; but it was opportunity of the every day sort, and it is the\r\nmerit that seized it, rather than the opportunity itself, that strikes\r\nthe attention. The present case was different. A young rear-admiral had\r\nlittle reason to hope for independent command; but Warren, a well-tried\r\nofficer, possessing the full confidence of the First Lord, Anson,\r\nhimself a master in the profession, was in poor health, and for that\r\nreason had applied for Hawke to be \"joined with him in the command,\"\r\napparently because he was the one flag-officer immediately available. He\r\nproposed that Hawke should for the present occasion take his place, sail\r\nwith a few ships named, and with them join the squadron, then at sea in\r\ncharge of a captain. Anson demurred at first, on the ground of Hawke's\r\njuniority,--he was forty-two,--and Warren, while persisting in his\r\nrequest, shares the doubt; for he writes, \"I observe what you say about\r\nthe ships abroad being under so young an officer. I am, and have been\r\nuneasy about it, though I hope he will do well, _and it could not then\r\nbe avoided_.\" Anson, however, was not fixed in his opposition; for\r\nWarren continued, \"From your letter I have so little reason to doubt his\r\nbeing put under my command, that I have his instructions all ready; and\r\nhe is prepared to go at a moment's notice.\" The instructions were issued\r\nthe following day, August 8th, and on the 9th Hawke sailed. But while\r\nthere was in this so much of luck, he was again to show that he was not\r\none to let occasion slip. Admiral Farragut is reported to have said,\r\n\"Every man has _one_ chance.\" It depends upon himself whether he is by\r\nit made or marred. Burrish and Hawke toed the same line on the morning\r\nof February 22d, and they had had that day at least equal opportunity.\r\n\r\nHawke's adequacy to his present fortune betrayed itself again in a\r\nphrase to Warren, \"I have nothing so much at heart as the faithful\r\ndischarge of my duty, and in such manner as will give satisfaction both\r\nto the Lords of the Admiralty and yourself. This shall ever be my utmost\r\nambition, and _no lucre of profit, or other views_, shall induce me to\r\nact otherwise.\" Not prize-money; but honor, through service. And this in\r\nfact not only ruled his thought but in the moment of decision inspired\r\nhis act. Curiously enough, however, he was here at odds with the spirit\r\nof Anson and of Warren. The latter, in asking Hawke's employment, said\r\nthe present cruise was less important than the one to succeed it, \"for\r\nthe galleons\"--the Spanish treasure-ships--\"make it a general rule to\r\ncome home late in the fall or winter.\" Warren by prize-money and an\r\nAmerican marriage was the richest commoner in England, and Anson it was\r\nthat had captured the great galleon five years before, to his own great\r\nincrease; but it was Hawke who, acknowledging a letter from Warren, as\r\nthis cruise was drawing to its triumphant close, wrote, \"With respect to\r\nthe galleons, as it is uncertain when they will come home and _likewise\r\nimpossible for me to divide my force in the_ present necessitous\r\ncondition of the ships under my command, I must lay aside all thoughts\r\nof them during this cruise.\" In this unhesitating subordination of\r\npecuniary to military considerations we see again the temper of Nelson,\r\nbetween whom and Hawke there was much community of spirit, especially in\r\ntheir independence of ordinary motives and standards. \"Not that I\r\ndespise money,\" wrote Nelson near the end of a career in which he had\r\nnever known ease of circumstances; \"quite the contrary, I wish I had a\r\nhundred thousand pounds this moment;\" but \"I keep the frigates about me,\r\nfor I know their value in the day of battle, and compared with that day,\r\nwhat signifies any prizes they might take?\" Yet he had his legal share\r\nin every such prize.\r\n\r\nThe opening of October 14th, the eighth day after Hawke's letter to\r\nWarren just quoted, brought him the sight of his reward. At seven that\r\nmorning, the fleet being then some four hundred miles west of La\r\nRochelle in France, a number of sails were seen in the southeast. Chase\r\nwas given at once, and within an hour it was evident, from the great\r\ncrowd of vessels, that it was a large convoy outward-bound which could\r\nonly be enemies. It was in fact a fleet of three hundred French\r\nmerchantmen, under the protection of eight ships-of-the-line and one of\r\nfifty guns, commanded by Commodore L'Etenduère. The force then with\r\nHawke were twelve of-the-line and two of fifty guns. Frigates and\r\nlighter vessels of course accompanied both fleets. The average size and\r\narmament of the French vessels were considerably greater than those of\r\nthe British; so that, although the latter had an undoubted superiority,\r\nit was far from as great as the relative numbers would indicate.\r\nProminent British officers of that day claimed that a French sixty-gun\r\nship was practically the equal of a British seventy-four. In this there\r\nmay have been exaggeration; but they had good opportunity for judging,\r\nas many French ships were captured.\r\n\r\nWhen L'Etenduère saw that he was in the presence of a superior enemy, he\r\nvery manfully drew out his ships of war from the mass, and formed them\r\nin order of battle, covering the convoy, which he directed to make its\r\nescape accompanied by one of the smaller ships-of-the-line with the\r\nlight cruisers. He contrived also to keep to windward of the approaching\r\nBritish. With so strong a force interposed, Hawke saw that no\r\nprize-money was easily to be had, but for that fortune his mind was\r\nalready prepared. He first ordered his fleet to form order of battle;\r\nbut finding time was thereby lost he changed the signal to that for a\r\ngeneral chase, which freed the faster sailers to use their utmost speed\r\nand join action with the enemy, secure of support in due time by their\r\nconsorts as they successively came up.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour before noon the leading British reached the French rear,\r\nalready under short canvas. The admiral then made signal to engage, and\r\nthe battle began. As the ships under fire reduced sail, the others\r\novertook them, passed by the unengaged side and successively attacked\r\nfrom rear to van. As Hawke himself drew near, Rodney's ship, the\r\n_Eagle_, having her wheel and much of her rigging shot away, was for the\r\ntime unmanageable and fell twice on board the flag-ship, the\r\n_Devonshire_, driving her to leeward, and so preventing her from close\r\naction with the French flag-ship _Tonnant_, of eighty guns, a force far\r\nexceeding that of the _Devonshire_, which had but sixty-six. \"This\r\nprevented our attacking _Le Monarque_, 74, and the _Tonnant_, within any\r\ndistance to do execution. However we attempted both, especially the\r\nlatter. While we were engaged with her, the breechings of all our\r\nlower-deck guns broke, and the guns flew fore and aft, which obliged us\r\nto shoot ahead, for our upper guns could not reach her.\" The breaking\r\nof the breechings--the heavy ropes which take the strain of the guns'\r\nrecoil--was doubtless accelerated by the undue elevation necessitated by\r\nthe extreme range. The collision with the _Eagle_ was one of the\r\nincidents common to battle, but it doubtless marred the completeness of\r\nthe victory. Of the eight French ships engaged, six were taken; two, the\r\n_Tonnant_ and her next astern, escaped, though the former was badly\r\nmauled.\r\n\r\nDespite the hindrance mentioned, Hawke's personal share in the affair\r\nwas considerable, through the conspicuous activity of the flag-ship.\r\nBesides the skirmish at random shot with the _Tonnant_, she engaged\r\nsuccessively the _Trident_, 64, and the _Terrible_, 74, both which were\r\namong the prizes. He was entirely satisfied also with the conduct of all\r\nhis captains,--save one. The freedom of action permitted to them by the\r\ngeneral chase, with the inspiring example of the admiral himself, was\r\nnobly used. \"Captain Harland of the _Tilbury_, 60, observing that the\r\n_Tonnant_ fired single guns at us in order to dismast us, stood on the\r\nother tack, _between her and the Devonshire_, and gave her a very smart\r\nfire.\" It was no small gallantry for a 60 thus to pass close under the\r\nundiverted broadside of an 80,--nearly double her force,--and that\r\nwithout orders; and Hawke recognized the fact by this particular notice\r\nin the despatch. With similar initiative, as the _Tonnant_ and\r\n_Intrépide_ were seen to be escaping, Captain Saunders of the Yarmouth,\r\n64, pursued them on his own motion, and was accompanied, at his\r\nsuggestion, by the sixty-gun ships of Rodney and of Saumarez. A detached\r\naction of an hour followed, in which Saumarez fell. The enemy escaped,\r\nit is true; but that does not impeach the judgment, nor lessen the\r\nmerits, of the officers concerned, for their ships were both much\r\nsmaller and more injured than those they attacked. Harland and Saunders\r\nbecame distinguished admirals; of Rodney it is needless to say the same.\r\n\r\nIn his report of the business, Hawke used a quaint but very expressive\r\nphrase, \"As the enemy's ships were large, _they took a great deal of\r\ndrubbing_, and (consequently) lost all their masts, except two, who had\r\ntheir foremasts left. This has obliged me to lay-to for these two days\r\npast, in order to put them into condition to be brought into port, as\r\nwell as our own, which have suffered greatly.\" Ships large in tonnage\r\nwere necessarily also ships large in scantling, heavy ribbed,\r\nthick-planked, in order to bear their artillery; hence also with sides\r\nnot easy to be pierced by the weak ordnance of that time. They were in a\r\ndegree armored ships, though from a cause differing from that of to-day;\r\nhence much \"drubbing\" was needed, and the prolongation of the drubbing\r\nentailed increase of incidental injury to spars and rigging, both their\r\nown and those of the enemy. Nor was the armor idea, directly, at all\r\nunrecognized even then; for we are told of the _Real Felipe_ in\r\nMathews's action, that, being so weakly built that she could carry only\r\ntwenty-four-pounders on her lower deck, she had been \"fortified in the\r\nmost extraordinary surprising manner; her sides being lined four or five\r\nfoot thick everywhere with junk or old cables to hinder the shot from\r\npiercing.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the conduct of one captain fell under Hawke's\r\ndispleasure. At a Council of War called by him after the battle, to\r\nestablish the fitness of the fleet to pursue the convoy, the other\r\ncaptains objected to sitting with Captain Fox of the _Kent_, until he\r\nhad cleared himself from the imputation of misbehavior in incidents they\r\nhad noticed. Hawke was himself dissatisfied with Fox's failure to obey a\r\nsignal, and concurred in the objection. On the subsequent trial, the\r\nCourt expressly cleared the accused of cowardice, but found him guilty\r\nof certain errors of judgment, and specifically of leaving the _Tonnant_\r\nwhile the signal for close action was flying. As the _Tonnant_ escaped,\r\nthe implication of accountability for that result naturally follows. For\r\nso serious a consequence the sentence only was that he be dismissed his\r\nship, and, although never again employed, he was retired two years after\r\nas a rear-admiral. It was becoming increasingly evident that error of\r\njudgment is an elastic phrase which can be made to cover all degrees of\r\nfaulty action, from the mistakes to which every man is liable and the\r\nmost faithful cannot always escape, to conduct wholly incompatible with\r\nprofessional efficiency or even manly honor.\r\n\r\nThe case of Fox was one of many occurring at about this period, which,\r\nhowever differing in detail between themselves, showed that throughout\r\nthe navy, both in active service before the enemy, and in the more\r\ndeliberate criteria of opinion which influence Courts-Martial, there was\r\na pronounced tendency to lowness of standard in measuring officer-like\r\nconduct and official responsibility for personal action; a misplaced\r\nleniency, which regarded failure to do the utmost with indulgence, if\r\nwithout approval. In the stringent and awful emergencies of war too much\r\nis at stake for such easy tolerance. Error of judgment is one thing;\r\nerror of conduct is something very different, and with a difference\r\nusually recognizable. To style errors of conduct \"errors of judgment\"\r\ndenies, practically, that there are standards of action external to the\r\nindividual, and condones official misbehavior on the ground of personal\r\nincompetency. Military standards rest on demonstrable facts of\r\nexperience, and should find their sanction in clear professional\r\nopinion. So known, and so upheld, the unfortunate man who falls below\r\nthem, in a rank where failure may work serious harm, has only himself to\r\nblame; for it is his business to reckon his own capacity before he\r\naccepts the dignity and honors of a position in which the interests of\r\nthe nation are intrusted to his charge.\r\n\r\nAn uneasy consciousness of these truths, forced upon the Navy and the\r\nGovernment by widespread shortcomings in many quarters--of which\r\nMathews's battle was only the most conspicuous instance--resulted in a\r\nvery serious modification of the Articles of War, after the peace. Up to\r\n1748 the articles dealing with misconduct before the enemy, which had\r\nbeen in force since the first half of the reign of Charles II., assigned\r\nupon conviction the punishment of \"death, or other punishment, as the\r\ncircumstances of the offence shall deserve and the Court-Martial shall\r\njudge fit.\" After the experiences of this war, the last clause was\r\nomitted. Discretion was taken away. Men were dissatisfied, whether\r\njustly or not, with the use of their discretion made by Courts-Martial,\r\nand deprived them of it. In the United States Navy, similarly, at the\r\nbeginning of the Civil War, the Government was in constant struggle with\r\nCourts-Martial to impose sentences of severity adequate to the offence;\r\nleaving the question of remission, or of indulgence, to the executive.\r\nThese facts are worthy of notice, for there is a facile popular\r\nimpression that Courts-Martial err on the side of stringency. The\r\nwriter, from a large experience of naval Courts, upon offenders of many\r\nranks, is able to affirm that it is not so. Marryat, in his day, midway\r\nbetween the two periods here specified, makes the same statement, in\r\n\"Peter Simple.\" \"There is an evident inclination towards the prisoner;\r\nevery allowance and every favor granted him, and no legal quibbles\r\nattended to.\" It may be added that the inconvenience and expense of\r\nassembling Courts make the executive chary of this resort, which is\r\nrarely used except when the case against an accused is pretty clear,--a\r\nfact that easily gives rise to a not uncommon assertion, that\r\nCourts-Martial are organized to convict.\r\n\r\nThis is the antecedent history of Byng's trial and execution. There had\r\nbeen many examples of weak and inefficient action--of distinct errors of\r\nconduct--such as Byng was destined to illustrate in the highest rank and\r\nupon a large scale, entailing an unusual and conspicuous national\r\ndisaster; and the offenders had escaped, with consequences to themselves\r\nmore or less serious, but without any assurance to the nation that the\r\npunishment inflicted was raising professional standards, and so giving\r\nreasonable certainty that the like derelictions would not recur. Hence\r\nit came to pass, in 1749, not amid the agitations of war and defeats,\r\nbut in profound peace, that the article was framed under which Byng\r\nsuffered:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Every person in the fleet, who through cowardice, negligence, or\r\n     disaffection, shall in time of action, ... not do his utmost to take\r\n     or destroy every ship which it shall be his duty to engage; and to\r\n     assist all and every of His Majesty's ships, or those of His\r\n     allies, which it shall be his duty to assist and relieve, ... being\r\n     convicted thereof by sentence of a Court-Martial, shall suffer\r\n     death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLet it therefore be observed, as historically certain, that the\r\nexecution of Byng in 1757 is directly traceable to the war of 1739-1747.\r\nIt was not determined, as is perhaps generally imagined, by an obsolete\r\nstatute revived for the purpose of a judicial murder; but by a recent\r\nAct, occasioned, if not justified, by circumstances of marked national\r\nhumiliation and injury. The offences specified are those of which\r\nrepeated instances had been recently given; and negligence is ranked\r\nwith more positive faults, because in practice equally harmful and\r\nequally culpable. Every man in active life, whatever his business, knows\r\nthis to be so.\r\n\r\nAt the time his battle with L'Etenduère was fought, Hawke was actually a\r\ncommander-in-chief; for Warren, through his disorder increasing upon\r\nhim, had resigned the command, and Hawke had been notified of the fact.\r\nHence there did not obtain in his case the consideration, so absurdly\r\nadvanced for limiting Nelson's reward after the Nile, that he was acting\r\nunder the orders of a superior several hundred miles away. Nevertheless,\r\nHawke, like Nelson later, was then a new man,--\"a young officer;\" and\r\nthe honor he received, though certainly adequate for a victory over a\r\nforce somewhat inferior, was not adequate when measured by that given\r\nto Anson, the First Lord of the Admiralty, for a much less notable\r\nachievement six months before. Anson was raised to the peerage; Hawke\r\nwas only given the Order of the Bath, the ribbon which Nelson coveted,\r\nbecause a public token, visible to all, that the wearer had done\r\ndistinguished service. It was at that period a much greater distinction\r\nthan it afterwards became, through the great extension in numbers and\r\nthe division into classes. He was henceforth Sir Edward Hawke; and\r\nshortly after the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, signed April 30, 1748,\r\nanother flag-promotion raised him to the rank of Vice-Admiral, of the\r\nBlue Squadron.\r\n\r\nSuch rank, accompanied by such recognized merit, insured that he should\r\nthenceforth always command in chief; and so it was, with a single brief\r\ninterval due to a very special and exceptional cause to be hereafter\r\nrelated. During the years of peace, from 1748 to 1755, his employment\r\nwas mainly on shore, in dockyard command, which carried with it\r\nincidentally a good deal of presiding over Courts-Martial. This duty, in\r\nhis hands, could hardly fail to raise professional standards, with all\r\nthe effect that precedents, established by the rulings and decisions of\r\nCourts, civil and military, exert upon practice. Such a period, however,\r\naffords but little for narration, either professional or personal,\r\nexcept when the particular occupations mentioned are the subject of\r\nspecial study. General interest they cannot be said to possess.\r\n\r\nBut while thus unmarked on the biographical side, historically these\r\nyears were pregnant with momentous events, which not only affected the\r\nfuture of great nations then existing, but were to determine for all\r\ntime the extension or restriction of their social systems and political\r\ntendencies in vast distant regions yet unoccupied by civilized man, or\r\nstill in unstable political tenure. The balance of world power, in\r\nshort, was in question, and that not merely as every occurrence, large\r\nor small, contributes its something to a general result, but on a grand\r\nand decisive scale. The phrase \"world politics,\" if not yet invented,\r\ncharacterizes the issues then eminently at stake, though they probably\r\nwere not recognized by contemporaries, still blinded by the traditions\r\nwhich saw in Europe alone the centre of political interests.\r\n\r\nTo realize the conditions, and their bearing upon a future which has\r\nbecome our present, we should recall that in 1748 the British Empire, as\r\nwe understand the term, did not exist; that Canada and Louisiana--\r\nmeaning by the latter the whole undefined region west of the\r\nMississippi--were politically and socially French; that between them the\r\nwide territory from the Alleghanies to the Mississippi was claimed by\r\nFrance, and the claim vigorously contested not only by Great Britain\r\nherself, but by the thirteen British colonies which became the United\r\nStates of America; that in India the representatives of both mother\r\ncountries were striving for mastery, not merely through influence in the\r\ncouncils of native rulers, but by actual territorial sway, and that the\r\nchances seemed on the whole to favor France.\r\n\r\nIn the great struggle for Anglo-Saxon predominance, which had begun\r\nunder William III., but was now approaching its crisis and final\r\ndecision in the Seven Years War, the determining factor was to be the\r\nmaritime strength of Great Britain. It is, therefore, the distinctive\r\nand distinguished significance of Hawke's career that during so critical\r\na period he not only was the most illustrious and able officer of her\r\nnavy--the exponent of her sea-power--but that by the force of his\r\npersonality he chiefly shaped the naval outcome. He carried on the\r\ndevelopment of naval warfare, revolutionized ideas, raised professional\r\nstandards, and thereby both affected the result in his own time, and\r\nperpetuated an influence, the effect of which was to be felt in the\r\ngigantic contests of later days. In this eminent particular, which\r\ninvolves real originality, no sea officer of the eighteenth century\r\nstands with him; in this respect only he and Nelson, who belongs rather\r\nto the nineteenth, are to be named together.\r\n\r\nIn the years of nominal peace, 1748-1755, the Navy of Great Britain was\r\npermitted by a politically cautious Government to decline much in\r\npower; but there was compensation in the fact that that of France\r\ndrooped equally. In both countries there was then, as there has been\r\never since, a party opposed to over-sea enterprise. \"The partisans of\r\nthe Ministry,\" wrote Walpole in 1755, \"d----n the Plantations [Colonies],\r\nand ask if we are to involve ourselves in a war for them.\" The French\r\ngovernment underwent a like revulsion of feeling as regarded India, and\r\nin 1754 recalled Dupleix in mid-career, in order to quiet the\r\nremonstrances of Great Britain. It would be irrelevant, were it not\r\nsignally instructive, to remark that both nations passed under the\r\ninfluence of the same ideas a hundred years later. In the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, the preponderant expression in England was that the\r\ncolonies were unprofitable incumbrances, and, if occasion arose, should\r\nbe encouraged to separate rather than urged to remain; while France,\r\nthrough whatever motive, at a critical moment abandoned the field in\r\nEgypt, by refusing joint action. It is, therefore, probably the result\r\nof a true national genius, asserting itself above temporary aberrations,\r\nthat the close of the nineteenth century saw France wholly excluded,\r\npolitically, from Egypt, as she had before been from India, and Great\r\nBritain involved in an expensive war, the aim of which was the\r\npreservation of the imperial system, in the interest not only of the\r\nmother country, but of the colonies as well.\r\n\r\nAnd that it was in the interest of her colonies was precisely the all\r\nimportant part which differentiated the Seven Years War in its day, and\r\nthe South African War in our day, from the struggle, so disastrous to\r\nthe Empire, that is known as the American Revolution. \"There is no\r\nrepose for our thirteen colonies,\" wrote Franklin a hundred and fifty\r\nyears ago, \"so long as the French are masters of Canada.\" \"There is no\r\nrepose for British colonists in South Africa,\" was the virtual assertion\r\nof Natal and the Cape Colony, \"so long as the Boer political methods are\r\nmaintained in the Transvaal with the pledged support of the Orange Free\r\nState.\" Irreconcilable differences of political and social systems, when\r\nbrought into close contact, involve irrepressible conflict, and admit of\r\nno lasting solution except the subjugation and consequent submersion of\r\none or the other.\r\n\r\nSuch a final settlement was attained in North America and in India by\r\nthe Seven Years War. The full results thereof even we of this day have\r\nnot yet seen; for who can yet predict the effect upon the question of\r\nthe Pacific and of China, that by this war was assured the dominance of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon political and legal tradition over the whole American\r\ncontinent north of the tropics, and that the same tradition shall, for a\r\nfuture yet indeterminate, decisively shape the course of India and the\r\nPhilippines? The preceding war, 1739-1748, had been substantially\r\ninconclusive on the chief points at issue, because European questions\r\nintervening had diverted the attention of both France and Great Britain\r\nfrom America and from India; and the exhaustion of both had led to a\r\nperfunctory compact, in which the underlying contention was\r\nsubstantially ignored in order to reach formal agreement. That the\r\nFrench conquest of Madras, in India, was yielded in exchange for\r\nLouisburg and Cape Breton Island, which the American colonists had won\r\nfor England, typifies concisely the _status quo_ to which both parties\r\nwere willing momentarily to revert, while they took breath before the\r\ninevitable renewal of the strife, with added fury, a few years later;\r\nbut then upon its proper scene, the sea and the over-sea regions in\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\nIn this great arbitrament Hawke was at once called forth to play his\r\npart. In 1754 diplomatic contention had become acrimonious, and various\r\nevents showed that the moment of open conflict was approaching. The\r\nsquadron in India was then considerably increased. In the beginning of\r\n1755 Hawke was again afloat to command the Channel Fleet, the operations\r\nof which extended ordinarily from the Channel, over the Bay of Biscay,\r\nto Cape Finisterre. A naval force was collecting at the same time at\r\nPortsmouth, under Boscawen, to counteract the preparations the French\r\nwere known to be making in North America. It sailed soon afterwards,\r\nwith orders to intercept a squadron convoying reinforcements for\r\nCanada; and on the 8th of June two of these ships were captured off the\r\nmouth of the St. Lawrence, the remainder escaping under cover of a fog.\r\nIn July Hawke went out, with instructions to take any French\r\nships-of-the-line that he might meet; and in August he was further\r\ndirected to send into port French ships of every kind, merchant and\r\nother, that he might encounter. Before the end of the year three hundred\r\ntrading vessels, valued at $6,000,000, had been thus seized. War had not\r\nyet been declared, but the captured vessels were held, as on other\r\noccasions before and after, as hostages to await the settlement of\r\nexisting difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe French government protested of course, and recalled its ambassador,\r\nbut it did not proceed to formal hostilities. A great stroke was in\r\npreparation at Toulon, which could be covered for a while by diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence, coupled with angry demonstrations on the Atlantic and\r\nChannel coasts. On the 10th of April, 1756, twelve French\r\nships-of-the-line and fifteen thousand troops sailed for Minorca, then a\r\nBritish possession, and in the absence of a hostile fleet effected a\r\nlanding without opposition. The British cabinet having taken alarm too\r\nlate, Admiral Byng had sailed from Portsmouth, with ten ships, only\r\nthree days before the French left Toulon; when he arrived off Port\r\nMahon, six weeks later, a practicable breach in the works had already\r\nbeen made. The French fleet was cruising outside in support of the\r\nsiege, and Byng, whose force had been increased to thirteen ships,\r\nengaged it on May 20. The action was in itself indecisive; but, upon the\r\nopinion of a council of war that nothing more could be done, Byng\r\nretired to Gibraltar. The result to him personally is well known. Port\r\nMahon surrendered on June 28. War had by this been declared; by Great\r\nBritain on the 17th of May, and by France June 20, 1756.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of Byng's retreat was received in England, Hawke was sent\r\nout to supersede him. He went only personally, accompanied by a second\r\nin command, but with no fleet, and with sealed instructions. Opening\r\nthese when he reached Gibraltar, he found orders to send home Byng and\r\nhis second in command, and to institute an inquiry into the conduct of\r\nthe captains, suspending any one found \"not to have acted with due\r\nspirit and vigor.\" An investigation of this kind would enable him to\r\nform an opinion of Byng's own conduct even more exact and authentic than\r\nhis other official opportunities for personal intercourse with the chief\r\nactors, but he must have refrained with much discretion from expressing\r\nhis judgment on the affair in such way as to reach the public ear. It\r\nwas stated in the \"Gentleman's Magazine,\" in 1766, that an inquiry was\r\nprovoked in the House of Commons, shortly after these events, by Pitt,\r\nwho took Byng's side; but that Hawke, being a member of the House,\r\ndenied some of Pitt's allegations as to the inadequacy of Byng's fleet,\r\non the strength of his own personal observation after taking over the\r\ncommand. Thereupon, so the account says, the categorical test question,\r\nthe _argumentum ad hominem_, was put to him whether with Byng's means he\r\ncould have beat the enemy; and the manner of the first Pitt, in thus\r\ndealing with an opponent in debate, can be imagined from what we know of\r\nhim otherwise. Whether the story be true or not, Hawke was not a man to\r\nbe so overborne, and the reply related is eminently characteristic, \"By\r\nthe grace of God, he would have given a good account of them.\" Whatever\r\nthe reason, there seems little doubt that Pitt did not like Hawke; but\r\nthe latter was at once too independent to care, and too necessary to be\r\ndiscarded.\r\n\r\nHe remained in the Mediterranean only six months, returning to England\r\nin January, 1757. His tenure of this command was marked by an incident\r\nwhich exemplifies the vigorous exercise of power frequent in naval\r\ncommanders, in the days when neither steam nor telegraph existed to\r\nfacilitate reference home for instructions; when men with their strong\r\nright arms redressed on the spot what they thought a wrong. A British\r\nship carrying supplies to Gibraltar, where Hawke was then lying, was\r\ncaptured by a French privateer and taken into the Spanish port of\r\nAlgeciras, on the opposite side of the bay. Her surrender was demanded\r\nfrom the governor of the port, Spain being then neutral; but, being\r\nrefused, the admiral sent the boats of the squadron and cut her out.\r\nThis being resisted by the Spanish forts, a hundred British seamen were\r\nkilled or wounded. On the admiral's return home, Pitt is reported to\r\nhave told him that he thought he would himself have acted in the same\r\nway, but would have made some concession afterwards. Hawke replied that\r\nhis duty, having the country's force in his hands, was to act as he\r\nhad,--not to make concessions; but that the Ministry could deal with the\r\ncase subsequently as it thought fit. In other words, as in joint\r\noperations with the army, later in the year, he took the ground that the\r\nland officers were the judges of their own business, but that he would\r\nsee them put safe on shore, as a first step; so in a matter affecting\r\nnational honor, as he conceived it, he would do the seaman's part and\r\nredress the injury, after which the civil authority could arrange with\r\nthe other party. The known details of this transaction are not full\r\nenough to permit a decided opinion as to how far the admiral was\r\njustified in his action, judged even by the international law of the\r\nday. It was not necessarily a breach of neutrality to admit a\r\nbelligerent with her prize; but it would have been, had the French ship\r\ngone out from Algeciras, seized her prey, and returned with it. Whatever\r\nthe facts, however, the episode illustrates interestingly the spirit of\r\nHawke himself, and of the service of that day, as well as his\r\ncharacteristic independence towards superiors when he felt himself\r\nright.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward Hawke's service was confined to the Channel\r\nFleet. This was, during that war, the post for the most capable of\r\nBritish officers; for, while the matter at stake was over-sea\r\npredominance and conquest, yet both these depended upon the\r\ncommunications of the French colonies and distant possessions with the\r\nmother country. The source of all their strength, the one base\r\nindispensable to their operations, was the coast of France; to close\r\nexit from this was therefore to strike at the root. This was much less\r\ntrue for the colonies of Great Britain, at least in America; their\r\nnumbers, and resources in every way, were so far superior to those of\r\nCanada that they needed only to be preserved from interference by the\r\nnavy of France,--an end also furthered by the close watch of the French\r\nports. This blockade, as it is often, but erroneously, styled, Hawke was\r\nthe first to maintain thoroughly and into the winter months; and in so\r\ndoing he gave an extension to the practice of naval warfare, which\r\namounted to a veritable revolution in naval strategy. The conception was\r\none possible only to a thorough seaman, who knew exactly and practically\r\nwhat ships could do; one also in whom professional knowledge received\r\nthe moral support of strong natural self-confidence,--power to initiate\r\nchanges, to assume novel responsibility, through the inner assurance of\r\nfull adequacy to bear it.\r\n\r\nAll this Hawke had. The method, therefore, the holding the sea, and the\r\nexposure of heavy ships to weather before thought impossible, was well\r\nwithin the range of his ability,--of his native and acquired faculties;\r\nbut it is due to him to recognize the intellectual force, the\r\noriginality, which lifted him above the accepted tradition of his\r\npredecessors, and by example transmitted to the future a system of\r\nwarfare that then, as well as in his own hands, was to exercise a\r\ndecisive effect upon the course of history. It is also to be remembered\r\nthat he took this weighty step with instruments relatively imperfect,\r\nand greatly so. The bottoms of ships were not yet coppered; in\r\nconsequence they fouled very rapidly, the result of which was loss of\r\nspeed. This meant that much greater power, press of canvas, was needed\r\nto force them through the water, and that they had to be sent frequently\r\ninto port to be cleaned. Thus they were less able than ships of later\r\ndays to overtake an enemy, or to keep off a lee shore, while more\r\nintricate administration and more ships were required to maintain the\r\nefficiency of the squadron by a system of reliefs. Hawke noted also\r\nanother difficulty,--the fatigue of the crews in cleaning their ships'\r\nbottoms. It was even more important to success, he said, to restore the\r\nseaman, worn by cruising, by a few days quiet and sleep in port, than to\r\nclean thoroughly at the expense of exhausting them. \"If the enemy should\r\nslip out and run,\" he writes, \"we must follow as fast as we can.\"\r\nDetails such as these, as well as the main idea, must be borne in mind,\r\nif due credit is to be given to Hawke for one of the most decisive\r\nadvances ever made in the practice of naval campaigning.\r\n\r\nSome time, however, was to elapse before the close watch of the French\r\nports became a leading feature in the naval policy of the government.\r\nThe early disasters of the war had forced the king, after much\r\nresistance, finally to accept the first Pitt as the leading minister of\r\nthe Crown, in June, 1757. Pitt's military purpose embraced two principal\r\nobjects: 1, the establishment of the British colonial system by the\r\ndestruction of that of France, which involved as a necessary precedent\r\nthe control of the sea by a preponderant navy; and, 2, the support of\r\nFrederic of Prussia, then engaged in his deadly contest with the\r\ncombined armies of France, Austria, and Russia. Frederic's activity made\r\na heavy drain upon the troops and the treasure of France, preventing her\r\nby just so much from supporting her colonies and maintaining her fleet;\r\nbut, heavily outnumbered as he was, it was desirable to work all\r\npossible diversion in his favor by attacks elsewhere. This Pitt proposed\r\nto do by a series of descents upon the French coast, compelling the\r\nenemy to detach a large force from before the Prussian king to protect\r\ntheir own shores.\r\n\r\nAs far as the home naval force was concerned, the years 1757 and 1758\r\nwere dominated by this idea of diversion in favor of Frederic the\r\nGreat. From the general object of these enterprises, the army was\r\nnecessarily the principal agent; but the navy was the indispensable\r\nauxiliary. Hawke's association with them is interesting chiefly as\r\nillustrative of professional character; for there was little or no room\r\nfor achievement of naval results. The first expedition in which he was\r\nconcerned was that against Rochefort in 1757. This, though now long\r\nforgotten, occasioned by its failure a storm of contemporary\r\ncontroversy. Whatever chances of success it may under any circumstances\r\nhave had were lost beforehand, owing to the lateness of the\r\nseason--June--in which Pitt took office. Preparation began at the moment\r\nwhen execution was due. The troops which should have sailed in early\r\nsummer could not, from delays apparently unavoidable under the\r\nconditions, get away before September 10. Hawke himself hoisted his\r\nflag--assumed active command--only on August 15. The previous\r\nadministration was responsible for whatever defect in general readiness\r\nincreased this delay; as regards the particular purpose, Pitt's\r\ngovernment was at fault in attempting at all an undertaking which, begun\r\nso late in the year, could not expect success under the notorious\r\ninadequacy of organization bequeathed to him by his predecessors. But\r\nthere will always be found at the beginning of a war, or upon a change\r\nof commanders, a restless impatience to do something, to make a showing\r\nof results, which misleads the judgment of those in authority, and\r\ncommonly ends, if not in failure, at least in barren waste of powder and\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nNot the least of the drawbacks under which the enterprise labored was\r\nextremely defective information--especially hydrographic. The character\r\nof the coast, the places suited for landing, the depths of water, and\r\nthe channels, were practically unknown. Hence a necessity for\r\nreconnoissances, pregnant of indefinite delay, as might have been\r\nforeseen. Among Hawke's memoranda occur the words, \"Not to undertake\r\nanything without good pilots.\" The phrase is doubly significant, for he\r\nwas not a man to worry needlessly about pilots, knowing that pilots look\r\nnot to military results, but merely to their own responsibility not to\r\ntake the ground; and it shows the total ignorance under which labored\r\nall who were charged with an undertaking that could only succeed as a\r\nsurprise, executed with unhesitating rapidity. Hawke himself was\r\nastounded at finding in Basque Roads, before Rochefort, \"a safe spacious\r\nroad in which all the navy of England, merchant ships included, may ride\r\nwithout the least annoyance. Before I came here, the place was\r\nrepresented as very difficult of access, and so narrow that ships could\r\nnot lie in safety from the forts--nay, _the pilots made many baulks\r\nbefore we came in_.\" In fact, want of good pilotage summed up the fault\r\nof the expedition, from its inception in the Cabinet throughout all the\r\nantecedent steps of consultation and preparation. Pitt's impetuosity\r\ndoubtless acted as a spur to laggards, but it was accompanied by a\r\ntendency to overbearing insolence that not infrequently browbeats\r\ncautious wisdom. When applied to a man like Hawke, strong in natural\r\ntemper and in conscious mastery of his profession, the tone\r\ncharacteristic of Pitt provokes an equally resolute self-assertion, as\r\nfar removed from subjection as it is from insubordination; but\r\nfriendship becomes impossible, and even co-operation difficult.\r\n\r\nThroughout all Hawke kept his head, and made no serious mistake; but he\r\naccepts no unmerited censures. Seeing that the transports are not enough\r\nfor the healthful carriage of the troops, he so represents it. The\r\ngovernment, already impatient at any report of defects, hopes that\r\nthings are now arranged to his _satisfaction_. \"I am astonished at this\r\nexpression,\" he says, \"it is my duty to represent defects, but I am\r\n_satisfied_ with any decision _you_ make.\" Again, \"I have received your\r\nletter signifying His Majesty's directions to use the utmost diligence\r\nin embarking the troops and getting to sea. As I cannot doubt my letter\r\nof Sunday being immediately communicated to you, I should have expected\r\nthat _before yours was sent_ His Majesty would have been fully satisfied\r\nthat I needed no spur in executing his orders.\" As Hawke and Anson--the\r\nFirst Lord--were friends, there can be little doubt that we see here a\r\nfirm protest against the much lauded tone to which the efficiency of the\r\nBritish army and navy under Pitt has been too exclusively attributed. It\r\nwas in the civil administration, the preparation that underlies military\r\nsuccess, which being at home was under his own eye, that Pitt's energy\r\nwas beneficially felt, and also in his prompt recognition of fit\r\ninstruments; but he had no need to discover Hawke or Boscawen. He might\r\nas well be thought to have discovered the sun.\r\n\r\nIn discharging his part of the expedition Hawke's course is consistent\r\nand clear. It must in the first place be recognized that such\r\nenterprises are of secondary importance, and do not warrant the risks\r\nwhich are not only justifiable but imperative when a decisive issue is\r\nat stake. Hawke's heroic disregard of pilotage difficulties at Quiberon,\r\nin 1759, would have been culpable temerity at Basque Roads, in 1757.\r\nBut, save delays on this account, no time is lost by him. When the\r\ndecision to land is reached, he is clear as to the possibility of\r\nlanding; but when the generals think it impossible to effect certain\r\nresults, he replies that is their business, on which he does not pretend\r\nto judge. In his evidence before the Court afterwards, he said, \"Whether\r\nthey should land or not, he constantly thought it the part of the\r\ngenerals to determine. He could not but suppose they were infinitely\r\nbetter judges of their own business than he could be.\" Their conduct was\r\nmarked by vacillations strange to him, and which apparently displeased\r\nhim; the troops being, on one occasion, embarked in the boats for some\r\nhours, and yet returning to the ships without proceeding. He then\r\naddressed a formal letter to the commanding general, saying that if he\r\nhad no further operation to propose the fleet would return at once to\r\nEngland, and he declined to attend a Council of War to decide either of\r\nthese points. The Army should decide, alone, whether it could effect\r\nanything by landing; if not, he, without asking counsel, would stay no\r\nlonger. On October 7th he reached Spithead.\r\n\r\nPitt, who had espoused Byng's cause against the previous administration,\r\nfollowed its precedent in throwing the blame on the military and naval\r\nleaders. In Parliament, he \"declared solemnly his belief that there was\r\na determined resolution, both in the naval and military commanders,\r\nagainst any vigorous exertion of the national power.\" For far less than\r\nthis accusation Byng had been condemned; but in fact the fault at\r\nRochefort lay clearly on those who issued the orders,--upon the Cabinet;\r\nupon the character of the expedition itself,--a great risk for a\r\nsecondary and doubtful object; upon the inconsiderate haste which\r\ndisregarded alike the season and the inadequate knowledge; upon\r\ndefective preparation in the broadest sense of the words. Diversions, in\r\ntruth, are feints, in which the utmost smoke with the least fire is the\r\nobject. Carried farther, they entail disaster; for they rest on no solid\r\nbasis of adequate force, but upon successful deception. Pitt's angry\r\ninjustice met with its due rebuke the next year at St. Cas. It can\r\nscarcely be doubted that words such as those quoted were responsible, in\r\npart at least, for the disastrous issue of that diversion, the story of\r\nwhich belongs, if to the navy at all, to the life of Howe.\r\n\r\nThat Hawke resented this language can scarcely be doubted, and none the\r\nless that he evidently himself felt that something might have been\r\nattempted by the troops. He was clear of fault in his own consciousness;\r\nbut in the general censure he was involved with his associates--known,\r\nso to say, by his friends, implicated in the meshes of a half-truth,\r\nwhere effort to clear one's self results in worse entanglement. He had\r\nthe manly cast of character which will not struggle for\r\nself-vindication; but his suppressed wrath gathered force, until a year\r\nlater it resulted, upon occasion of official provocation, in an\r\nexplosion that has not a close parallel in naval history.\r\n\r\nHe had hoisted his flag again on February 28, 1758. His first service\r\nwas directed against a French squadron of five ships-of-the-line,\r\nfitting at Rochefort to convoy troops for the relief of Louisburg, in\r\nCape Breton Island, then about to be besieged by British and colonial\r\nforces. Hawke's observations of the previous year had ascertained the\r\nhitherto unknown facilities of Basque Roads for occupation by a fleet\r\nand consequent effectual interception of such an expedition. Upon\r\nmaking the land the French vessels were found already in the Roads,\r\ntherefore soon to sail; but before this superior force of seven ships\r\nthey cut their cables, and fled across the shoals up the river Charente,\r\non which Rochefort lies. Hawke, instructed by his previous experience,\r\nhad earnestly but fruitlessly demanded fire-ships and bomb-vessels to\r\ndestroy the enemy in case they grounded on the flats; which they did,\r\nand for some hours lay exposed to such an attack. Not having these\r\nmeans, he had to watch helplessly the process of lightening and towing\r\nby which they at last made their escape. He then returned to England,\r\nhaving frustrated the relief expedition but, through defective\r\nequipment, not destroyed the vessels. The Admiralty, upon receiving his\r\nreport of the transaction, made no acknowledgments to him.\r\n\r\nPitt had profited by Hawke's ineffectual request for small vessels and\r\nhis suffering from the want of them; but he utilized the suggestions in\r\na manner that robbed their author of any share in the results. A\r\nsquadron of that sort was to be constituted, to operate on the French\r\ncoast in diversions like that of 1757; but it was to be an independent\r\ncommand, under an officer chosen by the Government without consulting\r\nthe admiral. To the main fleet was assigned the necessary, but in credit\r\nvery secondary, office of cruising off Brest, to prevent interruption by\r\nthe French ships there; to play, in short, the inconspicuous rôle of a\r\ncovering force, while the light squadron had the brilliant part of\r\nfighting. The officer selected for the latter was Howe, deservedly a\r\nfavorite of Hawke's, but not therefore acceptable to him as a supplanter\r\nin his honors.\r\n\r\nThe admiral had been for some time superintending the equipment of the\r\nvessels for the light division, when, on May 10, 1758, Howe reported to\r\nhim, bringing his orders. Hawke boiled over at once; and, in a heat\r\nevidently beyond his will to control, despatched the following letter,\r\nthree hours after Howe's arrival.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Portsmouth, 7 o'clock p.m. 10th May, 1758.\r\n\r\n     Sir,--About 4 o'clock arrived here Captain Howe, and delivered me\r\n     their Lordships' order of the 9th. In last September I was sent out\r\n     to command an expedition under all the disadvantages one could\r\n     possibly labor under, arising chiefly from my being under the\r\n     influence of land-officers in Councils of War at sea.[4] Last\r\n     cruise (March-April, 1758) I went out on a particular service,\r\n     almost without the least means of performing it. Now every means to\r\n     ensure success is provided; another is to reap the credit; while it\r\n     is probable that I, with the capital ships, might be ordered to\r\n     cruise in such a manner as to prevent his failing in this attempt.\r\n     To fit out his ships for this service I have been kept here,[5] and\r\n     even now have their Lordships' directions, at least in terms, to\r\n     obey him. He is to judge of what he wants for his expedition; he is\r\n     to make his demands, and I am to comply with them. I have\r\n     therefore directed my flag immediately to be struck, and left their\r\n     Lordships' orders with Vice-Admiral Holburne. For no consequence\r\n     that can attend my striking it without orders shall ever outbalance\r\n     with me the wearing it one moment with discredit.\r\n\r\n      I am, etc.\r\n      E. HAWKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to justify so extreme a step as abandoning one's\r\ncommand without permission, and especially under circumstances that\r\npermitted the orderly course of asking for detachment. Nevertheless,\r\nHawke did well to be angry; and, as is sometimes the case, an\r\ninjudicious and, in point of occasion, unseemly loss of temper,\r\ndoubtless contributed to insure for him in the future, to a degree which\r\nforbearance or mere remonstrance would not have assured, the\r\nconsideration essential to his duties. Many will remember the effect\r\nproduced by Plimsoll's unparliamentary outbreak. The erroneous\r\nimpression, that admirals and generals fit to be employed at all were to\r\nbe ridden booted and spurred, needed correction. Hawke had\r\nmisapprehended the intention of the Government, in so far as believing\r\nthat the light squadron was to be employed in Basque Roads, the scene of\r\nlast year's failure; but he was right in thinking that intrusting the\r\nenterprise to another, on that occasion his junior, would be a\r\nreflection upon himself, intensified by making the command practically\r\nindependent, while he was limited to the covering duty. Under these\r\ncircumstances, erroneously imagined by him, the squadron should have\r\nbeen attached to his command, and the particular direction left to him;\r\nthe Government giving to him, instead of to Howe, the general orders\r\nwhich it issued, and arranging with him beforehand as to the command of\r\nthe detached squadron.\r\n\r\nBut even under the actual conditions, of an intention to operate on the\r\nwestern Channel coast of France, it would have been graceful and\r\nappropriate to recognize Hawke's eminent past, and recent experience, by\r\nkeeping under his command the ships he had himself fitted for the\r\nservice, and directing him to despatch Howe with the necessary\r\ninstructions. It was as in the Nile campaign, where the general\r\ndirections were sent to St. Vincent, with a clear expression of the\r\nGovernment's preference for Nelson as the officer to take charge. The\r\nintended scene of Howe's operations, if not formally within Hawke's\r\ndistrict, was far less distant from Brest than Toulon and Italy were\r\nfrom Cadiz, where St. Vincent covered Nelson's detachment. In the wish\r\nfor secrecy, perhaps, or perhaps through mere indifference to the effect\r\nproduced upon Hawke, as a man assumed to need curb and spur, he was left\r\nin ignorance, to imagine what he pleased; and this action, succeeding\r\nprevious neglects and Pitt's imputations of the previous year, elicited\r\nan outburst which, while it cannot be justified in its particular\r\nmanifestation, was in spirit inevitable. A man submissive to such\r\ntreatment as he had good cause to suspect, would be deficient in the\r\nindependence of character, and sensitive regard to official reputation,\r\nwithout which he was unfit to command the Channel Fleet.\r\n\r\nHawke was summoned at once to the Admiralty, and in the interview which\r\nensued, as shown by the minutes endorsed on his own letter, his\r\nmisconception as to the quarter in which Howe was to act afforded\r\nstanding ground for a compromise. Hawke having committed himself\r\nofficially, and upon a mistaken premise, the Admiralty had him\r\ntechnically at their mercy; but such a triumph as they could win by\r\ndisciplining him would be more disastrous than a defeat. He disclaimed\r\nresentment towards any person, and reiterated that his action was\r\nintended merely to defend his character and honor, which he said--to\r\nquote the minute exactly--\"were not _so much_ touched as he apprehended\r\nwhen the suspicion he had of Mr. Howe's going to Basque Roads\r\narose--from the Lords asking him some days since for a draft of the\r\nRoads.\" The italics are the present writer's; but the words as they\r\nstand would indicate that he did not yield his view of the matter in\r\ngeneral, nor leave hearers under any doubt as to how far he could safely\r\nbe treated with contumely or slight. There can be little doubt that the\r\nsubstantial result was to strengthen his position in the exacting duty\r\nthat lay before him in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe whole business was then salved over by the First Lord, Anson, taking\r\ncommand of the Channel Fleet for the particular occasion. Hawke\r\naccompanied him as second in command, while Howe went his way with the\r\nlight squadron and the troops. Both divisions sailed on the 1st of June.\r\nOn the 18th our admiral was so unwell with a severe fever and cold--a\r\ncomplaint to which he was much subject--that he had to ask to be sent\r\ninto port. He went ashore before the end of the month, and remained\r\nunemployed till the following May.\r\n\r\nThe year 1759 is the culminating epoch of Hawke's career. In it occurred\r\nthe signal triumph of Quiberon Bay, the seal of his genius, significant\r\nabove all as demonstrating that the ardor of the leader had found\r\nfulfilment in his followers, that the spirit of Hawke had become the\r\nspirit of the Navy. This year also yielded proof of his great capacity\r\nas a seaman and administrator, in the efficient blocking of Brest,\r\nprolonged through six months of closest watching into the period of the\r\nwinter gales, in face of which it had hitherto been thought impossible\r\nto keep the sea with heavy ships massed in fleets; for, as he most\r\njustly said, in explaining the necessity of maintaining the rendezvous\r\nfixed by him, \"A single ship may struggle with a hard gale of wind when\r\na squadron cannot. In working against a strong westerly gale in the\r\nChannel, where it cannot make very long stretches,\"--because it finds\r\nshores and shoals on either side,--\"it must always by wearing lose\r\nground, but more especially if it should so blow as to put it past\r\ncarrying sail.\" The method used by Hawke was not only an innovation on\r\nall past practice, but, as has before been said, constituted the pattern\r\nwhereon were framed the great blockades of the Napoleonic period, which\r\nstrangled both the naval efficiency and the commercial and financial\r\nresources of the Empire. These were but developments of Hawke's fine\r\nachievement of 1759; the prestige of originality belongs to him. Even\r\ntheir success, with better ships and the improvement of detail always\r\naccompanying habit, is foreshadowed by his. \"I may safely affirm that,\r\nexcept the few ships that took refuge in Conquet, hardly a vessel of any\r\nkind has been able to enter or come out of Brest for four\r\nmonths,\"--ending October 10th. \"They have been obliged to unload near\r\nforty victuallers at Quimperley and carry their cargoes by land to\r\nBrest. It must be the fault of the weather, not ours, if any of them\r\nescape.\"\r\n\r\nIt was suitable indeed that so strenuous and admirable an exhibition of\r\nprofessional ability,--of naval generalship,--alike in strategic\r\ncombination, tactical disposition, and administrative superintendence,\r\nshould terminate in a brilliant triumph, at once its fruit and its\r\ncrown; wherein sedulous and unremittent readiness for instant action,\r\ncomprehended by few, received a startling demonstration which none could\r\nfail to understand. As Nelson was pursued by ignorant sneers before the\r\nNile, so Hawke was burned in effigy by the populace, at the very moment\r\nwhen laborious effort was about to issue in supreme achievement. The\r\nvictory in either case is less than the antecedent labor, as the crown,\r\nafter all, is less than the work, the symbol than the fact symbolized.\r\n\r\nA brief account of preceding conditions, and of the dispositions\r\nmaintained to meet them, is therefore necessary to due appreciation of\r\nthe victory of Quiberon Bay. Although the diversions of 1758 had not\r\nvery materially aided Frederic of Prussia, they had inflicted distinct\r\nhumiliation and harassment upon France. This, added to defeat upon the\r\nContinent and in North America, had convinced the French Government, as\r\nit convinced Napoleon a half-century later, that a determined blow must\r\nbe struck at England herself as the operative centre upon which rested,\r\nand from which proceeded, the most serious detriment to their cause and\r\nthat of their allies. It was resolved, therefore, to attempt an invasion\r\nof England; to the threat of which the English people were always\r\nextremely sensitive.\r\n\r\nFrom local conditions the French preparations had to be made in several\r\nseparate places; it was the task of the British Navy to prevent the\r\nconcentration of these different detachments in a joint effort. The\r\ntroops must embark, of course, from some place near to England; their\r\nprincipal points of assembly were on the Channel, whence they were to\r\ncross in flat-boats, and in the Biscay ports, from Brest to the mouth of\r\nthe Loire. The Bay of Quiberon, from which Hawke's action takes its\r\nname, lies between the two latter points. It is sheltered from the full\r\nforce of the Atlantic gales by a peninsula of the same name, and by some\r\nshoals which prolong the barrier to the southward of the promontory.\r\n\r\nTo cross safely, it was necessary to provide naval protection. To this\r\nend squadrons were equipped in Toulon and in Brest. Combined at the\r\nlatter point, and further strengthened by divisions expected to return\r\nfrom North America, they would constitute a force of very serious\r\nconsideration in point of numbers. Rochefort also was an element in the\r\nproblem, though a minor one; for either the small force already there\r\nmight join the concentration, or, if the port were unwatched, the\r\nAmerican or other divisions might get in there, and be at least so much\r\nnearer to Brest, or to a neighboring point of assembly, as Quiberon Bay.\r\n\r\nAs the French Navy was essential to the French crossing, as its junction\r\nwas essential to action, as the point of junction was at or near\r\nBrest--for there was the district near which the troops were\r\nassembling--and as by far the largest detachment was already in Brest,\r\nthat port became the important centre upon blocking which depended\r\nprimarily the thwarting of the invasion. If the French Navy succeeded in\r\nconcentrating at Brest, the first move in the game would be lost. Hawke\r\ntherefore had the double duty of not allowing the squadron there to get\r\nout without fighting, and of closing the entrance to reinforcements. The\r\nlatter was far the more difficult, and could not be assured beyond the\r\nchance of failure, because an on-shore gale, which would carry his fleet\r\ninto the Channel to avoid being driven on the French coast, would be\r\nfair for an outside enemy to run into the port, friendly to him. This\r\nactually occurred at a most critical moment, but it could only happen by\r\na combination of circumstances; that is, by the hostile squadron\r\nchancing to arrive at a moment when the British had been blown off. If\r\nit approached under ordinary conditions of weather it would run into the\r\nmidst of foes.\r\n\r\nThe great names of the British Navy were then all afloat in active\r\ncommand. Rodney was before Havre, which he bombarded in the course of\r\nthe summer, doing a certain amount of damage, harassing the local\r\npreparations for invasion, and intercepting vessels carrying supplies to\r\nthe Brest fleet and coastwise. Boscawen, second only to Hawke, was\r\nbefore Toulon, to hold there the dozen ships-of-the-line under De la\r\nClue, as Hawke was charged to stop the score under Conflans.\r\n\r\nIn broad conception, Hawke's method was simple and can be easily stated;\r\nthe difficulty lay in carrying it out. The main body of his force had a\r\nrendezvous, so chosen that in violent weather from the westward it could\r\nat worst drift up Channel, but usually would have a fair wind for\r\nTorbay, a roadstead on the British coast about a hundred miles distant.\r\nTo the rendezvous the fleet was not tied under ordinary circumstances;\r\nit was merely a headquarters which admitted of cruising, but where\r\ndespatches from home would always find the admiral in person, or news of\r\nhis whereabouts. Near Brest itself was kept an inshore squadron of three\r\nor four ships, which under ordinary circumstances could see the enemy\r\ninside, noting his forwardness; for the cannon of the day could not\r\nmolest a vessel more than a mile from the entrance, while the conditions\r\nwithin of spars and sails indicated to a seaman the readiness or\r\nintention to move, to a degree not ascertainable with ships dependent on\r\nsteam only.\r\n\r\nWith these dispositions, if a westerly gale came on, the fleet held its\r\nground while it could, but when expedient to go put into Torbay. Owing\r\nto the nearness of the two places, the weather, when of a pronounced\r\ncharacter, was the same at both. While the wind held to the westward of\r\nsouth, or even at south-southeast, a ship-of-the-line could not beat out\r\nfrom Brest; much less a fleet. The instant the wind went east, fair for\r\nexit, the British left Torbay, with certainty of not being too late;\r\nfor, though the enemy might get out before their return, the east wind\r\nwould not suffer them to close with the French coast at another point\r\nsoon enough to avoid a meeting. While in Torbay the time was improved by\r\ntaking on board stores and provisions; nor was the night's rest at\r\nanchor a small consideration for seamen worn with continual cruising.\r\n\r\nThe practical merits displayed by Hawke in maintaining this simple but\r\narduous service were, first and supremely, the recognition of its\r\npossibility, contrary to a tradition heretofore as commonly and as\r\nblindly accepted as those of the line-of-battle, and of the proper\r\nmethods for fleet attack before described. It must be remembered also\r\nthat in these wars, 1739-1763, for the first time the British Navy found\r\nthe scene of action, in European waters, to be the Biscay coast of\r\nFrance. In the former great wars of the seventeenth century, French\r\nfleets entered the Channel, and pitched battles were fought there and in\r\nthe North Sea. Thence the contest shifted to the Mediterranean, where\r\nthe great fleets operated in the later days of William III., and the\r\nreign of Anne. Then, too, the heavy ships, like land armies, went into\r\nwinter quarters. It was by distinguished admirals considered\r\nprofessionally criminal to expose those huge yet cumbrous engines of the\r\nnation's power to the buffetings of winter gales, which might unfit them\r\nnext year to meet the enemy, snugly nursed and restored to vigor in\r\nhome ports during the same time. The need of periodical refitting and\r\ncleaning the bottoms clinched the argument in favor of this seasonable\r\nwithdrawal from the sea.\r\n\r\nWith this presumed necessity, attention had not been paid to developing\r\na system of maintenance and refit adapted to the need of a fleet\r\nperforming what Hawke undertook. In this, of course, there cannot be\r\nassigned to him the individuality of merit that may belong to a\r\nconception, and does belong to the man who initiates and assumes, as he\r\ndid, the responsibility for a novel and hazardous course of action. Many\r\nagents had to contribute to the forwarding of supplies and repairs; but,\r\nwhile singleness of credit cannot be assumed, priority is justly due to\r\nhim upon whose shoulders fell not only all blame, in case his enterprise\r\nfailed, but the fundamental difficulty of so timing the reliefs of the\r\nvessels under his command, so arranging the order of rotation in their\r\ngoing and coming as to keep each, as well as the whole body, in a\r\nconstant condition of highest attainable efficiency--in numbers, in\r\nspeed, and in health--for meeting the enemy, whose time of exit could\r\nnot be foreknown. Naturally, too, the man on whom all this fell, and who\r\nto the nation would personify success or failure, as the event might\r\nbe,--terms which to him would mean honor or ruin,--that man, when\r\nprofessionally so competent as Hawke, would be most fruitful in orders\r\nand in suggestions to attain the desired end. In this sense there can be\r\nno doubt that he was foremost, and his correspondence bears evidence of\r\nhis preoccupation with the subject.\r\n\r\nInto particulars it is scarcely necessary to go. Administrative details\r\nare interesting only to specialists. But one quality absolutely\r\nessential, and in which most men fail, he manifested in high degree. He\r\nfeared no responsibility, either towards the enemy, or towards the home\r\nauthorities. Superior and inferior alike heard plainly from him in case\r\nof defects; still more plainly in case of neglect. \"It is a matter of\r\nindifference to me whether I fight the enemy, should they come out, with\r\nan equal number, one ship more, or one ship less.\" \"I depend not on\r\nintelligence from the French ports; what I see I believe, and regulate\r\nmy conduct accordingly;\" a saying which recalls one of Farragut's,--\"The\r\nofficers say I don't believe anything. I certainly believe very little\r\nthat comes in the shape of reports. They keep everybody stirred up. I\r\nmean to be whipped or to whip my enemy, and not to be scared to death.\"\r\nAgitation, to a very considerable degree, was the condition of Hawke's\r\nsuperiors; to say the least, anxiety strained to the point of\r\napproaching panic. But Hawke could have adopted truly as his own\r\nFarragut's other words, \"I have full confidence in myself and in my\r\njudgment,\"--that is, of course, in professional matters; and he spoke\r\nreassuringly out of the firmness of his self-reliance. \"Their Lordships\r\nwill pardon me for observing that from the present disposition of the\r\nsquadron I think there is little room for alarm while the weather\r\ncontinues tolerable.\" Again, a few days later, \"Their Lordships may rest\r\nassured there is little foundation for the present alarms. While the\r\nwind is fair for the enemy's coming out, it is also favorable for our\r\nkeeping them in; and while we are obliged to keep off they cannot stir.\"\r\nThis was in October, when the weather was already wild and the days\r\nshortening.\r\n\r\nWith equally little hesitancy, though without breach of subordination,\r\nhe overbears the Admiralty when they wish to pay what he considers\r\nexaggerated care to cleaning the bottoms, traceable, no doubt, to the\r\nprejudices of the Sea Lords. \"If the ships take up a month by cleaning,\r\nfrom the time they leave me to their return, it will be impossible for\r\nme to keep up the squadron. The only practicable way is to heel, etc.,\r\nand confine them to ten days in port for the refreshment of their\r\ncompanies in case they should miss the spring tide.\" \"Their Lordships\r\nwill give me leave to observe that the relief of the squadron depends\r\nmore on the refreshment of the ships' companies than on cleaning the\r\nships. By the hurry the latter must be performed in, unless the ship\r\ncontinues a month or five weeks in port, which the present exigency will\r\nby no means admit of, the men would be so harassed and fatigued that\r\nthey would return to me in a worse condition than when they left me....\r\nHowever, I shall endeavor to comply with all their Lordships' directions\r\nin such manner as, _to the best of my judgment, will answer their\r\nintentions in employing me here_.\" The words italicized strike the true\r\nnote of subordination duly tempered with discretion.\r\n\r\nTo the Navy Board, a civil adjunct to the Admiralty, but possessed of\r\nconsiderable independent power to annoy officers in active military\r\nservice, he took a more peremptory tone. He had discharged on his own\r\nauthority, and for reasons of emergency, a mutinous surgical officer.\r\nFor this he was taken to task, as Nelson a generation later was rebuked\r\nby the same body. \"I have to acquaint you,\" he replied, \"that there was\r\nno mistake in his being ordered by me to be discharged.\" He then gives\r\nhis reasons, and continues, \"For the real good of the service I ordered\r\nhim to be discharged, and his crime noted on his list of pay, for your\r\ninformation. I shall not enter into any dispute with you about my\r\nauthority as a Commanding Officer, neither do I ever think of\r\ninconveniences or prejudices to myself, as a party, according to your\r\ninsinuations, where the good of the service is concerned.\" It must be\r\nadded that to subordinates he was as liberal with praise as he was with\r\ncensure, where either was merited; nor did he fail in kindly personal\r\nintervention upon due occasion for deserving or unfortunate men. More\r\nreserved, apparently, than Nelson, he seems to have been like him\r\nsympathetic; and hence it was that, as before observed, it was his\r\nspirit that he communicated to the navy rather than a system, admirable\r\nas was the strategic system embodied in his methods of blockade. It was\r\nby personal influence rather than by formulated precept that Hawke\r\ninspired his service, and earned a just claim to be reckoned the\r\ngreatest force of his century in naval development.\r\n\r\nThe general conditions being as described, the fighting in the naval\r\ncampaign of 1759 began in the Mediterranean. On June 8th Boscawen,\r\nhaving driven two French frigates into a fortified bay near Toulon,\r\nattacked them with three ships-of-the-line. The attack failed, and the\r\nBritish ships were badly injured; a timely lesson on the general\r\ninexpediency of attacking shore batteries with vessels, unless for\r\nspecial and adequate reasons of probable advantage. In July he returned\r\nto Gibraltar, to refit and for provisions. In the absence of details,\r\npositive criticism is unwarranted; but it is impossible not to note the\r\ndifference between this step, during summer weather, and the Toulon\r\nblockades of Lord St. Vincent, who, when before Brest, modelled his\r\ncourse upon that of Hawke. The port being thus left open, De la Clue\r\nsailed on the 5th of August for Brest. On the 17th he was near the\r\nstraits of Gibraltar, hugging the African coast, and falling night gave\r\npromise of passing unseen, when a British lookout frigate caught sight\r\nof his squadron. She hauled in for Gibraltar at once, firing signal\r\nguns. Boscawen's ships were in the midst of repairs, mostly dismantled;\r\nbut, the emergency not being unforeseen, spars and sails were sent\r\nrapidly aloft, and within three hours they were underway in pursuit. The\r\nFrench division separated during the night. Five ships put into Cadiz.\r\nThe British next morning caught sight of the remaining seven, among\r\nwhich was the admiral, and a sharp chase resulted in the destruction of\r\nfive. From August 18th the Toulon fleet was eliminated from the\r\ncampaign; though the vessels in Cadiz remained to the end a charge upon\r\nHawke's watchfulness, similar to that caused by the enemy's divisions\r\nexpected from America.\r\n\r\nThat one of the latter was already on its way home, under the command of\r\nCommodore Bompart, was notified to our admiral on September 21st by a\r\ndespatch from England. He immediately sent a division of heavy ships to\r\nreinforce the light squadron to the southward. \"If the alarm is great\r\nnow,\" he said, \"it will be much greater if he get into Rochefort.\"\r\nFurther information from the West Indies contradicted the first report,\r\nand on October 10th Hawke recalled the ships-of-the-line, apparently at\r\nthe wish of the Admiralty; for he expresses his regret at doing so, and\r\nasks for more of the \"many ships\" then in England, that Rochefort may be\r\nblocked as well as Brest. The incident has now little importance,\r\nexcept as indicating the general national nervousness, and the\r\ndifficulty under which he labored through force inadequate to the\r\nnumerous and exacting duties entailed by constant holding the sea in\r\nwar. From this point of view it bears upon his conduct.\r\n\r\nThat Bompart was coming proved to be true. On November 10th Hawke\r\nanchored with the fleet in Torbay, after three days of struggle against\r\na very heavy westerly storm. \"Bompart, if near, may get in,\" he wrote\r\nthe Admiralty, \"but no ship can get out from any port in the Bay.\" The\r\nweather had then moderated, but was still too rough for boating, even in\r\nthe sheltered roadstead; hence he could get no reports of the state of\r\nthe ships, which shows incidentally the then defective system of\r\nsignalling. On the 12th he sailed, on the 13th was again forced into\r\nTorbay by a south-wester, but on the 14th got away finally. On the\r\nafternoon of the 16th the fleet was twenty-five miles from the Island of\r\nUshant, near Brest, and there learned from transports, returning from\r\nthe light division off Quiberon, that the French fleet had been seen the\r\nday before, seventy-five miles northwest of Belleisle; therefore some\r\nfifty or sixty miles southeast of the point where this news was\r\nreceived. Conflans had sailed the same day that the British last left\r\nTorbay, but before his departure Bompart had opportunely arrived, as\r\nHawke had feared. His ships were not able to go at once to sea on so\r\nimportant a mission, but their seasoned crews were a welcome\r\nreinforcement and were distributed through the main fleet, which\r\nnumbered twenty-one ships-of-the-line. Hawke had twenty-three.\r\n\r\nConcluding that the enemy were bound for Quiberon, Hawke carried a press\r\nof sail for that place. He knew they must be within a hundred miles of\r\nhim and aimed to cut them off from their port. During the 17th the wind,\r\nhanging to the south and east, was adverse to both fleets, but on the\r\n18th and 19th it became more favorable. At half-past eight on the\r\nmorning of the 20th, one of the lookout frigates ahead of the British\r\nmade the signal for sighting a fleet. It was then blowing strong from\r\nthe west-northwest, and Belleisle, which is ten miles west of Quiberon\r\nBay, and south of which the fleets must pass, was by the English\r\nreckoning forty miles distant. A course of some fifty or sixty miles was\r\ntherefore to be run before the enemy could close the land, and there\r\nremained about eight hours of sun.\r\n\r\nHawke's day had come. Towards ten o'clock he had the enemy sufficiently\r\nin view to see that they were intent upon securing their arrival, rather\r\nthan fighting. He therefore made signal for the seven ships nearest them\r\n\"to chase and draw into a line-of-battle ahead of me, and endeavour to\r\nstop them till the rest of the squadron should come up, who also were\r\n_to form as they chased that no time might be lost_ in the pursuit.\" The\r\nFrench \"kept going off under such sail as all their squadron could\r\ncarry and _yet keep together_, while we crowded after him _with every\r\nsail our ships could bear_.\" The words italicized sum up the whole\r\nphilosophy of a general chase. The pursued are limited to the speed of\r\nthe slowest, otherwise he who cannot but lag is separated and lost; the\r\npursuer need slacken no whit, for his friends are ever coming up to his\r\naid. Overtaking is inevitable, unless the distance is too short.\r\n\r\nAt half-past two firing began between the French rear and the leading\r\nBritish. Of the two foremost in the chase, who thus opened the fight,\r\none was the same _Dorsetshire_ which in Mathews's battle had played the\r\nlaggard. Her captain, who thus rose to his opportunity, was one of the\r\ntwo to whom Hawke addressed the enthusiastic compliment that they had\r\n\"behaved like angels.\" Hawke himself was at this moment south of\r\nBelleisle, with several ships ahead of him; while the French admiral was\r\nleading his fleet, in order better to pilot them over dangerous ground,\r\nand by his own action show more surely than was possible by signal what\r\nhe wished done from moment to moment. At the southern extreme of the\r\nshoals which act as a breakwater to Quiberon Bay are some formidable\r\nrocks, known as the Cardinals. Around these M. de Conflans passed soon\r\nafter the firing began, his rear being then in hot action.\r\n\r\nHawke himself was without a pilot, as were most of his captains. The\r\nsailing master of the flag-ship was charged with that duty for the\r\nfleet, but had of the ground before him no exact personal knowledge; nor\r\ncould reliance be placed upon the imperfect surveys of a locality, which\r\nit was not the interest of an almost constant enemy to disclose. Enough,\r\nhowever, was known to leave no doubt of the greatness of the risks, and\r\nit was the master's part to represent them. The occasion, however, was\r\nnot one of a mere diversion, of a secondary operation, but of one vital\r\nto the nation's cause; and Hawke's reply, stamped with the firmness of a\r\ngreat officer, showed how little professional timidity had to do with\r\nhis laudable care of his fleet in Basque Roads two years before. \"You\r\nhave done your duty in warning me,\" he replied; \"now lay us alongside\r\nthe French Commander-in-chief.\" So amid the falling hours of the day the\r\nBritish fleet, under the unswerving impulse of its leader, moved\r\nsteadfastly forward, to meet a combination of perils that embraced all\r\nmost justly dreaded by seamen,--darkness, an intricate navigation, a lee\r\nshore fringed with outlying and imperfectly known reefs and shoals,\r\ntowards which they were hurried by a fast-rising wind and sea, that\r\nforbade all hope of retracing their steps during the long hours of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\"Had we but two hours more daylight,\" wrote Hawke in his official\r\nreport, \"the whole had been totally destroyed or taken; for we were\r\nalmost up with their van when night overtook us.\" His success would\r\nhave been greater, though not more decisive of issues than the event\r\nproved it; but nothing could have added to the merit or brilliancy of\r\nhis action, to which no element of grandeur was wanting. This was one of\r\nthe most dramatic of sea fights. Forty-odd tall ships, pursuers and\r\npursued, under reefed canvas, in fierce career drove furiously on; now\r\nrushing headlong down the forward slope of a great sea, now rising on\r\nits crest as it swept beyond them; now seen, now hidden; the helmsmen\r\nstraining at the wheels, upon which the huge hulls, tossing their prows\r\nfrom side to side, tugged like a maddened horse, as though themselves\r\nfeeling the wild \"rapture of the strife\" that animated their masters,\r\nrejoicing in their strength and defying the accustomed rein.\r\n\r\nThe French admiral had flattered himself that the enemy, ignorant of the\r\nground, would not dare to follow him round the Cardinals. He was soon\r\nundeceived. Hawke's comment on the situation was that he was \"for the\r\nold way of fighting, to make downright work with them.\" It was an old\r\nway, true; but he had more than once seen it lost to mind, and had\r\nhimself done most to restore it to its place,--a new way as well as an\r\nold. The signals for the general chase and for battle were kept aloft,\r\nand no British ship slacked her way. Without ranged order, save that of\r\nspeed, the leaders mingled with the French rear; the roar and flashes\r\nof the guns, the falling spars and drifting clouds of smoke, now adding\r\ntheir part to the wild magnificence of the scene. Though tactically\r\nperfect in the sole true sense of tactics, that the means adopted\r\nexactly suited the situation, this was a battle of incidents, often\r\nuntold,--not one of manoeuvres. As the ships, rolling heavily, buried\r\ntheir flanks deeply in the following seas, no captain dared to open his\r\nlower tier of ports, where the most powerful artillery was arrayed--none\r\nsave one, the French _Thésée_, whose rashness was rebuked by the\r\ninpouring waters, which quickly engulfed both ship and crew. The\r\n_Superbe_ met a like fate, though not certainly from the same cause. She\r\nsank under the broadside of the _Royal George_, Hawke's flag-ship. \"The\r\n_Royal George's_ people gave a cheer,\" wrote an eye witness, \"but it was\r\na faint one; the honest sailors were touched at the miserable state of\r\nso many hundreds of poor creatures.\" Americans and English can couple\r\nthis story of long ago with Philip's ejaculation off Santiago de Cuba,\r\nbut three years since: \"Don't cheer, boys, those poor devils are dying.\"\r\n\r\nBy five o'clock two French ships had struck, and two had been sunk.\r\n\"Night was now come,\" wrote Hawke, \"and being on a part of the coast,\r\namong islands and shoals of which we were totally ignorant, without a\r\npilot, as was the greatest part of the squadron, and blowing hard on a\r\nlee shore, I made the signal to anchor.\" The day's work was over, and\r\ndoubtless looked to him incomplete, but it was effectually and finally\r\ndone. The French Navy did not again lift up its head during the three\r\nyears of war that remained. Balked in their expectation that the foe's\r\nfear of the beach would give them refuge, harried and worried by the\r\nchase, harnessed to no fixed plan of action, Conflans's fleet broke\r\napart and fled. Seven went north, and ran ashore at the mouth of the\r\nlittle river Vilaine which empties into Quiberon Bay. Eight stood south,\r\nand succeeded in reaching Rochefort. The fate of four has been told.\r\nConflans's flag-ship anchored after night among the British, but at\r\ndaybreak next morning cut her cables, ran ashore, and was burned by the\r\nFrench. One other, wrecked on a shoal in the bay, makes up the tale of\r\ntwenty-one. Six were wholly lost to their navy; the seven that got into\r\nVilaine only escaped to Brest by twos, two years later, while the\r\nRochefort division was effectually blocked by occupying Basque Roads,\r\nthe islands of which and of Quiberon were cultivated as kitchen gardens\r\nfor the refreshment of British crews.\r\n\r\nOf the British, one ship went on a shoal during the action, and on the\r\nfollowing day another coming to her assistance also grounded. Both were\r\nlost, but most of their people were saved. Beyond this Hawke's fleet\r\nsuffered little. \"As to the loss we have sustained,\" wrote he, \"let it\r\nbe placed to the account of the necessity I was under of running all\r\nrisks to break this strong force of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nA contemporary witness assigns to Hawke's own ship a large individual\r\nshare in the fighting. Of this he does not himself speak, nor is it of\r\nmuch matter. That all was done with her that could be done, to aid in\r\nachieving success, is sufficiently assured by his previous record.\r\nHawke's transcendent merit in this affair was that of the general\r\nofficer, not of the private captain. The utmost courage shown by the\r\ncommander of a single ship before the enemy's fire cannot equal the\r\nheroism which assumes the immense responsibility of a doubtful issue, on\r\nwhich may hang a nation's fate; nor would the admiral's glory be shorn\r\nof a ray, if neither then nor at any other time had a hostile shot\r\ntraversed his decks.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 20th passed in anxieties inseparable from a situation\r\ndangerous at best, but still more trying to an admiral upon whom, after\r\nsuch a day, night had closed without enabling him to see in what case\r\nmost of his ships were. \"In the night,\" he reports, \"we heard many guns\r\nof distress fired, but, blowing hard, want of knowledge of the coast,\r\nand whether they were fired by a friend or an enemy, prevented all means\r\nof relief.\" In the morning he resumed his activity. Little, however,\r\ncould be done. The continuing violence of the wind, and ignorance of\r\nthe ground, prevented approach within gun-shot to the ships at the mouth\r\nof the Vilaine, while they, by lightening and favor of the next flood\r\ntide, warped their way inside through the mud flats.\r\n\r\nHawke remained nearly two months longer, returning to England January\r\n17, 1760. He had then been thirty-five weeks on board, without setting\r\nfoot on shore. At the age of fifty-four, and amid such manifold cares,\r\nit is not to be wondered at that he should need relief. Rather must he\r\nbe considered fortunate that his health, never robust in middle life,\r\nheld firm till his great triumph was achieved. Boscawen succeeded him\r\ntemporarily in the command.\r\n\r\nHe was received in England with acclamations and with honors; yet the\r\nmost conspicuous mark of approval conferred on admirals before and\r\nafter, the grant of the peerage, was not given to him, who had wrought\r\none of the very greatest services ever done for the country. Recent\r\nprecedent--that of Anson--demanded such recognition; and popular\r\nenthusiasm would have applauded, although the full military merit of the\r\nman could scarcely be appreciated by the standards of his generation.\r\nThat no such reward was bestowed is most probably attributable to\r\nHawke's own indifference to self-advancement. If demanded by him, it\r\ncould scarcely have been refused; but he never pushed his own interests.\r\nHis masculine independence in professional conduct, towards superiors\r\nand inferiors, found its root and its reflection in personal\r\nunconcern--as well antecedent as subsequent--about the results from his\r\nactions to his fortunes. To do his own part to the utmost, within the\r\nlines of the profession he knew, was his conception of duty. As he would\r\nnot meddle with the land officers' decision as to what they should or\r\nshould not do, so he left to the politicians, in whose hands the gifts\r\nlay, to decide what they would, or should, accord to a successful\r\nadmiral. Pitt, the Great Commoner, left Hawke a commoner. Possibly he\r\nrecognized that only by stretch of imagination could Hawke be reckoned\r\none of the creations of a great Minister's genius.\r\n\r\nLittle remains to tell. On September 3, 1762, the admiral's flag was\r\nhauled down for the last time. He never went to sea again. In 1766, when\r\nPitt came back to power as Lord Chatham, Hawke became First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, and so remained till 1771. It was a time of unbroken peace,\r\nsucceeding a period of continuous wars extending over a quarter of a\r\ncentury; consequently there was in naval and military matters the\r\nlassitude usual to such a period. Hawke is credited with formulating the\r\nprinciple that \"the British fleet could only be termed considerable in\r\nthe proportion it bore to that of the House of Bourbon;\" that is, to the\r\ncombined navies of France and Spain, over which that House then reigned.\r\nThe maxim proves that he had some claim to statesmanship in his view of\r\naffairs outside his service; and his manifested freedom from\r\nself-seeking is the warrant that no secondary political motives would\r\ndivert his efforts from this aim. That he succeeded in the main, that he\r\nwas not responsible for the fallen condition of the fleet when war again\r\narose in 1778, is evidenced by a statement, uncontradicted, in the House\r\nof Lords in 1779, that when he left office the navy had 139\r\nships-of-the-line, of which 81 were ready for sea.\r\n\r\nIn 1765 Hawke, who was then already a full admiral, wearing his flag at\r\nthe mainmast head, was made Vice-Admiral of Great Britain; an honorary\r\nposition, but the highest in point of naval distinction that the nation\r\nhad to give. As one who held it three-quarters of a century later wrote,\r\n\"It has ever been regarded as the most distinguished compliment\r\nbelonging to our profession.\" The coincidence is significant that upon\r\nHawke's death Rodney succeeded him in it; affirming, as it were, the\r\nconsecutiveness of paramount influence exercised by the two on the\r\ndevelopment of the Navy. In 1776 the peerage was at last conferred;\r\nseventeen years after his great victory, and when, having passed three\r\nscore and ten, a man who had ever disdained to ask must have felt the\r\nhonor barren to himself, though acceptable for his son.\r\n\r\nHis last recorded professional utterances are in private letters\r\naddressed in the summer of 1780 to the commander-in-chief of the\r\nChannel Fleet--Francis Geary--who had served with him in the Bay of\r\nBiscay, though he missed Quiberon. He recommends the maintenance of his\r\nold station off Brest, and says, \"For God's sake, if you should be so\r\nlucky as to get sight of the enemy, get as close to them as possible. Do\r\nnot let them shuffle with you by engaging at a distance, but get within\r\nmusket shot if you can. This will be the means to make the action\r\ndecisive.\" In these words we find an unbroken chain of tradition between\r\nHawke and Nelson. One of Hawke's pupils was William Locker; and Locker\r\nin turn, just before Hawke's death, had Nelson for a lieutenant. To him\r\nNelson in after years, in the height of his glory, wrote, \"To you, my\r\ndear friend, I owe much of my success. It was you who taught me,--'Lay a\r\nFrenchman close and you will beat him.'\"\r\n\r\nHawke died October 16, 1781. On his tomb appear these words, \"Wherever\r\nhe sailed, victory attended him.\" It is much to say, but it is not all.\r\nVictory does not always follow desert. \"It is not in mortals to command\r\nsuccess,\"--a favorite quotation with the successful admirals St. Vincent\r\nand Nelson. Hawke's great and distinctive glory is this,--that he, more\r\nthan any one man, was the source and origin of the new life, the new\r\nspirit, of his service. There were many brave men before him, as there\r\nwere after; but it fell to him in a time of great professional\r\nprostration not only to lift up and hand on a fallen torch, but in\r\nhimself to embody an ideal and an inspiration from which others drew,\r\nthus rekindling a light which it is scarcely an exaggeration to say had\r\nbeen momentarily extinguished.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] For the account of Mathews's action, including Hawke's personal\r\nshare in it, see _ante_, pp. 21-47.\r\n\r\n[4] By express orders from the Ministry Councils of War had to be held.\r\n\r\n[5] An application for four days' leave for private business had been\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRODNEY\r\n\r\n1719-1792\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike Hawke, Rodney drew his descent from the landed gentry of England,\r\nand had relatives among the aristocracy. The name was originally Rodeney.\r\nWe are told by his son-in-law and biographer that the Duke of Chandos, a\r\nconnection by marriage, obtained the command of the Royal yacht for the\r\nadmiral's father, Henry Rodney. In one of the trips which George I.\r\nfrequently made between England and Hanover, he asked his captain if\r\nthere were anything he could do for him. The reply was a request that he\r\nwould stand sponsor for his son, who accordingly received the name of\r\nGeorge; his second name Brydges coming from the family through which\r\nChandos and the Rodneys were brought into relationship. The social\r\nposition and surroundings resulting from such antecedents contributed of\r\ncourse to hasten the young officer's advancement, irrespective of the\r\nunquestionable professional merit shown by him, even in early years; but\r\nto them also, combined with narrow personal fortune, inadequate to the\r\ntastes thus engendered, was probably due the pecuniary embarrassment\r\nwhich dogged him through life, and was perhaps the moving incentive to\r\ndoubtful procedures that cast a cloud upon his personal and official\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nRodney was born in February, 1719, and went to sea at the age of\r\nthirteen; serving for seven years in the Channel Fleet. Thence he was\r\ntransferred to the Mediterranean, where he was made lieutenant in 1739.\r\nIn 1742 he went again to the Mediterranean with Admiral Mathews, who\r\nthere gave him command of a \"post\" ship, with which he brought home the\r\ntrade,--three hundred merchant vessels,--from Lisbon. Upon arriving in\r\nEngland his appointment by Mathews was \"confirmed\" by the Admiralty.\r\nBeing then only twenty-four, he anticipated by five years the age at\r\nwhich Hawke reached the same rank of post-captain, the attainment of\r\nwhich fixed a man's standing in the navy. Beyond that, advancement went\r\nby seniority; a post-captain might be \"yellowed,\"--retired as a rear\r\nadmiral,--but while in active service he kept the advantage of his early\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\nWhen Rodney was in later years commander-in-chief in the West Indies, he\r\nmade his son a post-captain at fifteen; an exercise of official powers\r\nwhich, though not singular to him, is too characteristic of the man and\r\nthe times to be wholly unmentioned. His own promotion, though rapid, was\r\nnot too much so for his professional good; but it is likely that\r\nneither that consideration, nor the good of the service, counted for\r\nmuch alongside of the influence he possessed. He appears, however, to\r\nhave justified from the first the favor of his superiors. His employment\r\nwas continuous, and in a military point of view he was more fortunate\r\nthan Hawke was at the same period of his career. Within two years, when\r\nin command of a forty-gun ship, he fought and took a French privateer of\r\nthe same nominal force, and with a crew larger by one hundred than his\r\nown. Thence he was advanced into the _Eagle_, sixty, in which, after\r\nsome commerce-destroying more lucrative than glorious, he bore an\r\nextremely honorable part in Hawke's battle with L'Etenduère, already\r\nrelated. The _Eagle_ was heavily engaged, and was one of the three small\r\nships that on their own initiative pursued and fought, though\r\nunsuccessfully, the two escaping French vessels. Rodney shared Hawke's\r\ngeneral encomium, that \"as far as fell within my notice, the commanders,\r\ntheir officers, and ships' companies, behaved with the greatest spirit\r\nand resolution.\" Rodney came under his close observation, for, the\r\n_Eagle's_ \"wheel being shot to pieces and all the men at it killed, and\r\nall her braces and bowlines gone,\" she drove twice on board the\r\nflag-ship. This was before her pursuit of the two fliers.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent trial of Captain Fox,--the minutes of which the\r\npresent writer has not seen,--it appears, according to the biographer\r\nof Lord Hawke,[6] that it was Captain Saunders's and Captain Rodney's\r\n\"sense of being deserted by Fox, and of the two French ships having\r\nescaped through his failure of duty, which forms the chief feature of\r\nthe Court-Martial. Rodney especially describes his being exposed to the\r\nfire of four of the enemy's ships, when, as he asserted, Fox's ship\r\nmight well have taken off some of it.\" The incident is very noteworthy,\r\nfor it bears the impress of personal character. Intolerance of\r\ndereliction of duty, and uncompromising condemnation of the delinquent,\r\nwere ever leading traits in Rodney's course as a commander-in-chief. He\r\nstood over his officers with a rod, dealt out criticism unsparingly, and\r\navowed it as his purpose and principle of action so to rule. It is not\r\nmeant that his censures were undeserved, or even excessive; but there\r\nentered into them no ingredient of pity. His despatches are full of\r\ncomplaints, both general and specific. When he spared, it was from a\r\nsense of expediency,--or of justice, a trait in which he was by no\r\nmeans deficient; but for human weakness he had no bowels. Hawke\r\ncomplains of but this one captain, Fox, and towards him he seems not to\r\nhave evinced the strong feeling that animated his juniors. Each man has\r\nhis special gift, and to succeed must needs act in accordance with it.\r\n\r\nThere are those who lead and those who drive; Hawke belonged to the one\r\nclass, Rodney to the other.\r\n\r\nIn direct consequence of this difference of temperament, it will be\r\nfound, in contrasting the schools of which Hawke and Rodney are the\r\nconspicuous illustrations, that the first represents the spirit, and the\r\nsecond the form, which were the two efficient elements of the progress\r\nmade during the eighteenth century. The one introduces into a service\r\narrested in development, petrified almost, by blindly accepted rules and\r\nunintelligent traditions, a new impulse, which transforms men from\r\nwithin, breaking through the letter of the law in order to realize its\r\nforgotten intent; the other gives to the spirit, thus freed from old\r\nlimitations, a fresh and sagacious direction, but needs nevertheless to\r\nimpose its own methods by constraint from without. It is the old\r\nstruggle, ever renewed, between liberty and law; in the due, but\r\ndifficult, combination of which consist both conservation and progress.\r\n\r\nAnd so in the personality of the two great admirals who respectively\r\nrepresent these contrasting schools of practice; while we find in both\r\nthese two elements, as they must exist in every efficient officer, yet\r\nit is to be said that the one inspires and leads, the other moulds and\r\ncompels. The one, though seemingly reserved, is in character\r\nsympathetic, and influences by example chiefly; the other, austerely\r\ncourteous, is towards associates distant and ungenial, working by fear\r\nrather than by love. For these broad reasons of distinction it is\r\nMathews's battle that best measures the reaction of which Hawke is the\r\ntype, for there was especially illustrated defect of spirit, to cover\r\nwhich the letter of the law was invoked; whereas in Byng's action,\r\nextremely bad form, in the attempt to conform to the letter of the\r\nInstructions, emphasizes the contrast with Rodney's methods, precise and\r\nformal unquestionably, but in which form ceases to be an end in itself\r\nand is reduced to its proper function as the means to carry into effect\r\na sound military conception. Of these two factors in the century's\r\nprogress, it needs hardly to be said that the one contributed by Hawke\r\nis the greater. In spirit and in achievement he, rather than Rodney, is\r\nthe harbinger of Nelson.\r\n\r\nA short time after the action with L'Etenduère the cruise of the _Eagle_\r\ncame to an end. When she was paid off Rodney was presented at Court by\r\nAnson, the First Lord of the Admiralty; a merited and not unusual honor\r\nafter distinguished service in battle. The King was struck by his\r\nyouthful appearance, and said he had not known there was so young a\r\ncaptain in the Navy. As he was then nearly thirty, and had seen much and\r\ncontinuous service, it is singular that his face should not have borne\r\nclear traces of the facts. Anson replied that he had been a captain for\r\nsix years, and it was to be wished that His Majesty had a hundred more\r\nas good as he. Making allowance for courtly manners and fair-speaking,\r\nthe incident may be accepted as showing, not only that aptitude for the\r\nservice which takes its hardships without undue wear and tear, but also\r\nan official reputation already well established and recognized.\r\n\r\nProfessional standing, therefore, as well as family influence, probably\r\ncontributed to obtain for him in 1749 the appointment of Commodore and\r\nCommander-in-chief on the Newfoundland station; for he was still junior\r\non the list of captains, and had ten years more to run before obtaining\r\nhis admiral's flag. He remained in this post from 1749 to 1752. They\r\nwere years of peace, but of peace charged full with the elements of\r\ndiscord which led to the following war. Canada was still French, and the\r\nterritorial limits between the North American possessions of the two\r\nnations remained a subject of dispute and intrigue. The uncertain state\r\nof political relations around the Gulf of St. Lawrence added to the\r\nresponsibility of Rodney's duty, and emphasized the confidence shown in\r\nassigning him a position involving cautious political action.\r\n\r\nExplicit confirmation of this indirect testimony is found in a private\r\nletter to him from the Earl of Sandwich, who had succeeded Anson as\r\nFirst Lord in 1748. \"I think it necessary to inform you that, if the\r\nGovernor of Nova Scotia should have occasion to apply to you for succor,\r\nand send to you for that purpose to Newfoundland, it would be approved\r\nby Government if you should comply with his request. It is judged\r\nimproper, as yet, to send any public order upon a business of so\r\ndelicate a nature, which is the reason of my writing to you in this\r\nmanner; and I am satisfied that your prudence is such as will not suffer\r\nyou to make any injudicious use of the information you now receive.\r\nThere are some people that cannot be trusted with any but public orders,\r\nbut I shall think this important affair entirely safe under your\r\nmanagement and secrecy.\" Language such as this undoubtedly often covers\r\na hint, as well as expresses a compliment, and may have done so in this\r\ninstance; nevertheless, in after life it is certain that Rodney gave\r\nproof of a very high order of professional discretion and of independent\r\ninitiative. It is therefore perfectly reasonable to suppose that he had\r\nthus early convinced the Government that he was a man competent and\r\ntrustworthy under critical conditions, such as then characterized the\r\nintercolonial relations of the two states. The particular incident is\r\nfarther noteworthy in connection with the backwardness, and even\r\nreluctance, of the Government to employ him in the War of the American\r\nRevolution, though Sandwich was again First Lord, and Rodney a strong\r\npolitical supporter of the party in power. The precise cause for this is\r\nprobably not ascertainable; but it is a matter of perfectly reasonable\r\ninference that the early promise of the young officer had meanwhile\r\nbecome overclouded, that distrust had succeeded to confidence, for\r\nreasons professional, but not strictly military. Rodney's war record\r\ncontinued excellent from first to last; one not good only, but of\r\nexceptional and singular efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1752, Rodney returned to England, having been elected to\r\nParliament. The Seven Years War, which, after two years of irregular\r\nhostilities, began formally in 1756, found him still a captain. With its\r\nmost conspicuous opening incident, the attempted relief of Minorca, and\r\nthe subsequent trial and execution of the unsuccessful commander,\r\nAdmiral Byng, he had no connection, personal or official; nor was he a\r\nmember of the Court-Martial, although he seems to have been in England\r\nat the time, and was senior to at least one of the sitting captains. The\r\nabortive naval engagement off Port Mahon, however, stands in a directly\r\nsignificant relation to his career, for it exemplifies to the most\r\nexaggerated degree, alike in the purpose of the admiral and the finding\r\nof the Court, the formal and pedantic conception of a correctly fought\r\nfleet action, according to the rules and regulations \"in such cases\r\nprescribed\" by the Fighting Instructions.[7] It was Rodney's lot to\r\nbreak with this tradition, and to be the first to illustrate juster\r\nideas in a fairly ranged battle, where the enemy awaited attack, as he\r\nhad done at Malaga in 1704, and at Minorca in 1756. Precisely such an\r\nopportunity never came to Hawke; for, although L'Etenduère waited, he\r\ndid so under conditions and dispositions which gave the ensuing affair a\r\nnearer analogy to a general chase than to a pitched battle. Though the\r\nBritish approach then was in a general sense parallel to the enemy's\r\nline, it was from the rear, not from the beam; and through this\r\ncircumstance of overtaking, and from the method adopted, their vessels\r\ncame under fire in succession, not together. This was perfectly correct,\r\nthe course pre-eminently suited to the emergency, and therefore\r\ntactically most sound; but the conditions were not those contemplated by\r\nthe Fighting Instructions, as they were in the case of Byng, and also in\r\nthe battle most thoroughly characteristic of Rodney--that of April 17,\r\n1780. The contrast in conduct between the two commanders is strikingly\r\nsignificant of progress, because of the close approach to identity in\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nRodney accompanied the Rochefort expedition of 1757, under Hawke, some\r\naccount of which is given in the life of that admiral; and he commanded\r\nalso a ship-of-the-line in Boscawen's fleet in 1758, when the reduction\r\nof Louisburg and Cape Breton Island was effected by the combined British\r\nand colonial forces. After this important service, the necessary and\r\neffectual antecedent of the capture of Quebec and the fall of Canada in\r\nthe following year, he returned to England, where on the 19th of May,\r\n1759, he was promoted to Rear Admiral; being then forty. He was next,\r\nand without interval of rest, given command of a squadron to operate\r\nagainst Havre, where were gathering boats and munitions of war for the\r\nthreatened invasion of England; with the charge also of suppressing the\r\nFrench coastwise sailings, upon which depended the assembling of the\r\nvarious bodies of transports, and the carriage of supplies to the fleet\r\nin Brest, that Hawke at the same time was holding in check. The service\r\nwas important, but of secondary interest, and calls for no particular\r\nmention beyond that of its general efficiency as maintained by him.\r\n\r\nIn 1761, Rodney was again elected to Parliament, and, with a certain\r\npolitical inconsequence, was immediately afterwards sent out of the\r\ncountry, being appointed to the Leeward Islands Station, which embraced\r\nthe smaller Antilles, on the eastern side of the Caribbean Sea, with\r\nheadquarters at Barbados; Jamaica, to the westward, forming a distinct\r\ncommand under an admiral of its own. He sailed for his new post October\r\n21, 1761, taking with him instructions to begin operations against\r\nMartinique upon the arrival of troops ordered from New York. These\r\nreached Barbados December 24th, a month after himself, and on the 7th of\r\nJanuary, 1762, the combined forces were before Martinique, which after a\r\nmonth of regular operations passed into the possession of the British on\r\nthe 16th of February. Its fall was followed shortly by that of the\r\nother French Lesser Antilles,--Grenada, Santa Lucia, and St. Vincent.\r\nGuadaloupe had been taken in 1759, and Dominica in June, 1761.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the contest on the seas had been between Great Britain\r\nand France only; but on March 5th a frigate reached Rodney with\r\ninstructions, then already nine weeks old, to begin hostilities against\r\nSpain, whose clearly inimical purpose had induced the British Government\r\nto anticipate her action, by declaring war. The same day another vessel\r\ncame in with like orders from the admiral at Gibraltar, while a third\r\nfrom before Brest brought word that a French squadron of seven\r\nships-of-the-line, with frigates and two thousand troops, had escaped\r\nfrom that port at the end of the year. With these circumstances before\r\nhim Rodney's conduct was like himself; prompt and officer-like. Lookout\r\nships were stationed along the length of the Caribbees, to windward, to\r\nbring timely intelligence of the approach of the enemy's squadron; and\r\nas its first destination was probably Martinique, the fall of which was\r\nnot yet known in Europe, he concentrated his fleet there, calling in\r\noutlying detachments.\r\n\r\nSo far there was nothing in his course markedly different from that of\r\nany capable officer, dealing with well ascertained conditions within the\r\nlimits of his own command. Occasion soon arose, however, to require more\r\nexceptional action, and thus to illustrate at once the breadth of view,\r\nand the readiness to assume responsibility, which already raised Rodney\r\nconspicuously above the average level. On the 9th of March two lookout\r\nvessels came in with news that they had sighted a fleet, corresponding\r\nin numbers to the Brest division, fifteen miles to windward of\r\nMartinique and standing to the southward; the trade wind making it\r\ngenerally expedient to round the south point of the island in order to\r\nreach the principal port on the west side,--Fort Royal. The British\r\nsquadron at once weighed anchor in pursuit; but the enemy, having\r\nascertained that the surrender was accomplished, had turned back north,\r\nand were soon after reported from Guadaloupe as having passed there,\r\nstanding to the westward.\r\n\r\nRodney at once inferred that they must be gone to Santo Domingo. To\r\nfollow with the object of intercepting them was hopeless, in view of the\r\nstart they had; but the direction taken threatened Jamaica, the exposed\r\ncondition of which, owing to inadequate force, had been communicated to\r\nhim by the military and naval authorities there. His measures to meet\r\nthe case were thorough and deliberate, as well as rapid; no time was\r\nlost either by hesitancy or delay, nor by the yet more facile error of\r\ntoo precipitate movement. Orders for concentration were already out, but\r\nthe point on which to effect it was shifted to Antigua, where, although\r\ninferior in natural resources to Martinique, the established British\r\nnaval station with its accumulated equipment was fixed; and the work of\r\nprovisioning and watering, so as to permit long continuance at sea\r\nunhampered by necessity of replenishing, there went on apace. It was the\r\nadmiral's intention to leave his own command to look out for itself,\r\nwhile he took away the mass of his fleet to protect national interests\r\nelsewhere threatened.\r\n\r\nSuch a decision may seem superficially a commonplace matter of course;\r\nthat it was much more is a commonplace historical certainty. The merit\r\nof Rodney's action appears not only in the details of execution, but in\r\nits being undertaken at all; and in this case, as in a later instance in\r\nhis career, his resolution received the concrete emphasis that a sharp\r\nand immediate contrast best affords. Prior to the enemy's arrival he had\r\nlaid the conditions before his colleague in service, General Moncton,\r\ncommanding the forces on shore, and asked a reinforcement of troops for\r\ndestitute Jamaica, if necessity arose. The result is best told in his\r\nown words; for they convey, simply and without egotistic enlargement,\r\nthat settled personal characteristic, the want of which Jervis and\r\nNelson in their day noted in many, and which Rodney markedly possessed.\r\nThis was the capacity, which Sandwich eighteen years later styled\r\n\"taking the great line of considering the King's whole dominions under\r\nyour care;\" an attribute far from common, as Moncton's reply showed. \"I\r\nacquainted him that I should certainly assist them with all the naval\r\nforce that could possibly be spared from the immediate protection of His\r\nMajesty's Caribbee islands. I have again solicited the General for a\r\nbody of troops, since the enemy left these seas, and must do him the\r\njustice to say, that he seems much concerned at the present distress of\r\nJamaica, but does not think himself sufficiently _authorized_ to detach\r\na body of troops without orders from England. I flatter myself their\r\nLordships will not be displeased with me if I take the liberty to\r\nconstrue my instructions in such a manner as to think myself _authorized\r\nand obliged_ to succor any of His Majesty's colonies that may be in\r\ndanger; and shall, therefore, without a moment's loss of time, hasten to\r\nthe succor of Jamaica, with ten sail-of-the-line, three frigates and\r\nthree bombs.\"[8]\r\n\r\nIt was not because, in so doing this, the obligation was absolute, and\r\nthe authority indisputable, that Rodney's course was professionally\r\nmeritorious. In such case his action would have risen little above that\r\nobedience to orders, in which, as Nelson said, the generality find \"all\r\nperfection.\" The risk was real, not only to his station, but to the\r\npossible plans of his superiors at home; the authority was his own only,\r\nread by himself into his orders--at most their spirit, not their letter.\r\nConsequently, he took grave chance of the penalty--loss of reputation,\r\nif not positive punishment,--which, as military experience shows, almost\r\ninvariably follows independent action, unless results are kind enough to\r\njustify it. It is, however, only the positive characters capable of\r\nrising to such measures that achieve reputations enduring beyond their\r\nown day. The incident needs to be coupled with Sandwich's compliment\r\njust quoted, as well as with the one paid him when on the Newfoundland\r\ncommand. Taken together, they avouch a personality that needs only\r\nopportunity to insure itself lasting fame.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, Rodney not only took the responsibility of stripping his\r\nown station to the verge of bareness in favor of the general interest,\r\nbut in so doing he came very near traversing, unwittingly, the plans of\r\nthe general government by his local action, laudable and proper as that\r\ncertainly was. He was, however, professionally lucky to a proverb, and\r\nescaped this mischance by a hair's breadth. The purposed detachment had\r\nalready started for Jamaica, and he was accompanying it in person, when\r\nthere joined him on March 25th, off the island of St. Kitt's, not far\r\nfrom Antigua, a frigate bearing Admiralty despatches of February 5th.\r\nThese required him to desist from any enterprises he might have in hand,\r\nin order to give his undivided attention to the local preparations for\r\nan expedition, as yet secret, which was shortly to arrive on his\r\nstation, under the command of Admiral Pocock, with ultimate destination\r\nagainst Havana.\r\n\r\nTo be thus arrested at the very outset of a movement from which he\r\nnaturally expected distinction was a bitter disappointment to Rodney.\r\nSeveral years later, in 1771, he wrote to Sandwich, who was not the\r\nFirst Lord when Pocock was sent out, \"I had the misfortune of being\r\nsuperseded in the command of a successful fleet, entrusted to my care in\r\nthe West Indies, at the very time I had sailed on another expedition\r\nagainst the enemy's squadron at Santo Domingo, and was thereby deprived\r\nof pursuing those conquests which so honorably attended upon another,\r\nand which secured him such great emoluments,\"--for Havana proved a\r\nwealthy prize. His steps, however, upon this unexpected reversal of his\r\nplans, were again characterized by an immediateness, most honorable to\r\nhis professional character, which showed how thoroughly familiar he was\r\nwith the whole subject and its possible contingencies, and the\r\nconsequent readiness of his mind to meet each occasion as it arose;\r\nmarks, all, of the thoroughly equipped general officer. The order as to\r\nhis personal movements being not discretional, was of course absolutely\r\naccepted; but his other measures were apparently his own, and were\r\ninstantaneous. A vessel was at once sent off to Barbados to notify\r\nAdmiral Pocock that the best place in the West Indies for his rendezvous\r\nwas Fort Royal Bay, in the newly acquired Martinique. The ten\r\nsail-of-the-line, accompanied by two large transports from St. Kitt's,\r\nwere then sent on to Jamaica to move troops from there to join Pocock;\r\nthe command of the detachment being now entrusted to Sir James Douglas,\r\nwho received the further instruction to send back his fastest frigate,\r\nwith all the intelligence he could gather, directing her to keep in the\r\ntrack Pocock would follow, in order to meet him betimes. The frigate\r\nthus sent, having first made a running survey of the unfrequented\r\npassage north of Cuba, by which the expedition was to proceed, joined\r\nPocock, and, by the latter's report, acted as pilot for the fleet.\r\n\"Having taken sketches of the land and cayos on both sides, Captain\r\nElphinstone kept ahead of the fleet, and led us through very well.\" This\r\nservice is claimed to the credit of Rodney's foresight by his\r\nbiographer. This may very well be, though more particular inquiry and\r\ndemonstration by his letters would be necessary to establish specific\r\norders beyond the general instructions given by him. It is, however,\r\nsafe to say that such particularity and minuteness of detail would be\r\nentirely in keeping with the tenor of his course at this period. His\r\ncorrespondence bears the stamp of a mind comprehensive as well as exact;\r\ngrasping all matters with breadth of view in their mutual relations, yet\r\nwith the details at his fingers' ends. The certainty of his touch is as\r\nobvious as the activity of his thought.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the spirit of his instructions, Rodney went in person\r\nto Martinique, the spot named by him as best for the rendezvous, there\r\nto superintend the preparations; to sow the seed for a harvest in which\r\nhe was to have no share. Incidental mention reveals that the sending of\r\nthe ships-of-the-line with Douglas had reduced him to three for his own\r\ncommand; and also that Moncton, having now superior authority to do so,\r\nfound himself able to spare troops for Jamaica, which were afloat in\r\ntransports by the time Pocock came. In the same letter the admiral\r\nfrankly admits his anxiety for his station, under the circumstances of\r\nthe big detachment he had made; a significant avowal, which enhances the\r\nmerit of his spontaneous action by all the credit due to one who endures\r\na well-weighed danger for an adequate end.\r\n\r\nThe despatch of Pocock's expedition, which resulted in the fall of\r\nHavana, August 13, 1762, practically terminated Rodney's active service\r\nin the Seven Years War. In a career marked by unusual professional good\r\nfortune in many ways, the one singular mischance was that he reached a\r\nforemost position too late in life. When he returned to England in\r\nAugust, 1763, he was in his full prime, and his conduct of affairs\r\nentrusted to him had given clear assurance of capacity for great things.\r\nThe same evidence is to be found in his letters, which, as studies of\r\nofficial character and competency, repay a close perusal. But now\r\nfifteen years of peace were to elapse before a maritime war again broke\r\nout, and the fifteen years between forty-five and sixty tell sorely upon\r\nthe physical stamina which need to underlie the mental and moral forces\r\nof a great commander. St. Vincent himself staggered under the load, and\r\nRodney was not a St. Vincent in the stern self-discipline that had\r\nbraced the latter for old age. He had not borne the yoke in his youth,\r\nand from this time forward he fought a losing fight with money troubles,\r\nwhich his self-controlled contemporary, after one bitter experience, had\r\nshaken off his shoulders forever.\r\n\r\nThe externals of Rodney's career during the period now in question are\r\nsufficiently known; of his strictly private life we are left largely to\r\ninfer from indications, not wholly happy. He returned to England a\r\nVice-Admiral of the Blue, and had advanced by the successive grades of\r\nthat rank to Vice-Admiral of the Red, when, in January, 1771, he was\r\nappointed Commander-in-chief at Jamaica. At this time he had been for\r\nfive years Governor of Greenwich Hospital, and he took it hard that he\r\nwas not allowed to retain the appointment in connection with his new\r\ncommand, alleging precedents for such a favor; the latest of which,\r\nhowever, was then twenty-five years old. The application was denied by\r\nSandwich. From the earnest tone in which it was couched, as well as the\r\ncomparatively weak grounds upon which Rodney bases his claims to such a\r\nrecognition, it can scarcely be doubted that pecuniary embarrassment as\r\nwell as mortification entered into his sense of disappointment. It is\r\nthe first recorded of a series of jars between the two, in which,\r\nalthough the external forms of courtesy were diligently observed, an\r\nunderlying estrangement is evident.\r\n\r\nThe Jamaica Station at that day required, in an even greater degree than\r\nNewfoundland before the conquest of Canada, a high order of political\r\ntact and circumspection on the part of the naval commander-in-chief. The\r\nisland lies in the centre of what was then a vast semi-circular sweep of\r\nSpanish colonies--Porto Rico, Santo Domingo, Cuba, Mexico, Central\r\nAmerica, and the mainland of South America from the Isthmus to the\r\nOrinoco. Over this subject empire the mother country maintained\r\ncommercial regulations of the most mediæval and exclusive type;\r\noutraging impartially the British spirit of commercial enterprise, and\r\nthe daily needs of her own colonists, by the restrictions placed upon\r\nintercourse between these and foreigners. Smuggling on a large scale,\r\nconsecrated in the practice of both parties by a century of tradition,\r\nwas met by a coast-guard system, employing numerous small vessels called\r\nguarda-costas, which girt the Spanish coasts, but, being powerless to\r\nrepress effectually over so extensive a shore line, served rather to\r\nincrease causes of vexation. The British government, on the other hand,\r\nnot satisfied to leave the illicit trade on which Jamaica throve to\r\ntake care of itself, sought to increase the scope of transactions by the\r\ninstitution of three free ports on the island,--free in the sense of\r\nbeing open as depots, not for the entrance of goods, but where they\r\ncould be freely brought, and transshipped to other parts of the world by\r\nvessels of all nations; broker ports, in short, for the facilitation of\r\ngeneral external trade.\r\n\r\nTo this open and ingenuous bid for fuller advantage by Spanish resort,\r\nSpain replied by doubling her custom-house forces and introducing\r\nrenewed stringency into her commercial orders. The two nations, with\r\nFrance in Hayti for a third, stood on ceaseless guard one against the\r\nother; all imbued with the spirit of exclusive trade, and differing only\r\nin the method of application, according to their respective day-to-day\r\nviews of policy. The British by the free-port system, instituted in\r\ntheir central geographical position, hoped to make the profits of the\r\nmiddleman. Rodney reported that the effect had been notably to\r\ndiscourage the direct Spanish intercourse, and to destroy carriage by\r\nBritish colonial vessels in favor of those of France, which now flocked\r\nto Jamaica, smuggled goods into the island, and apparently cut under\r\ntheir rivals by the greater benevolence shown them in Spanish ports.\r\n\"Commerce by British bottoms has totally ceased.\" Herewith, he added,\r\ndisappeared the opportunities of British seamen to become familiar with\r\nthe Spanish and French waters, while their rivals were invited to\r\nfrequent those of Jamaica; so that in case of war--which in those days\r\nwas periodical--the advantage of pilotage would be heavily on the side\r\nof Great Britain's enemies. He also stated that the diminution of\r\nemployment to British merchant vessels had greatly impaired his means of\r\nobtaining information from within Spanish ports; for British ships of\r\nwar were never allowed inside them, even when sent with a message from\r\nhim. The French permitted them indeed to enter, but surrounded them\r\nthroughout their visits with flattering attentions which wholly\r\nprevented the making of observations.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions of mutual jealousy between the governments and\r\nofficials, with the subjects on either side straining continually at the\r\nleashes which withheld them from traffic mutually beneficial, causes of\r\noffence were quick to arise. Rodney, like Sandwich, was a pronounced\r\nTory, in full sympathy with traditional British policy, as well as an\r\nofficer naturally of haughty temper and sharing all the prepossessions\r\nof his service; but he found himself almost at once involved in a\r\ndifference with his superiors in his political party, which throws a\r\ngood deal of side light on personal as well as political relations. The\r\nBritish man-of-war schooner _Hawke_ was overhauled off the Venezuelan\r\ncoast by two Spanish guarda-costas and compelled to enter the harbor of\r\nCartagena, under alleged orders from the Governor of the colony. After a\r\nbrief detention, she was let go with the admonition that, if any British\r\nships of war were found again within twelve leagues of the coast, they\r\nwould be taken and their crews imprisoned.\r\n\r\nRodney's course was unimpeachable, as far as appears. He wrote a civil\r\nletter to the Governor, and sent it by a ship of war, the captain of\r\nwhich was directed to deliver it in person. He was confident, he wrote,\r\nthat the Governor would disavow the action by calling to strict account\r\nthe officers concerned, and would also confirm his own belief that it\r\nwas impossible such a menace could have proceeded from any adequate\r\nauthority. A sufficient intimation of what would follow an attempt to\r\ncarry out the threat was conveyed by the words: \"The British officer who\r\nhas dishonoured his King's colours by a tame submission to this insult\r\nhas been already dismissed the service.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see what less could have been done; but the British\r\ngovernment was at the moment extremely reluctant to war, and sensitive\r\nto any step that seemed to make towards it. Spain was thought to be\r\nseeking a quarrel. She had entered the Seven Years War so near its\r\ntermination as not to feel exhaustive effects; and the capture of Havana\r\nand Manila, with the pecuniary losses involved, had left her merely\r\nembittered by humiliation, prone rather to renew hostilities than to\r\nprofit by experience. At the same time the foreign policy of Great\r\nBritain was enfeebled by a succession of short ministries, and by\r\ninternal commotions; while the discontent of the American continental\r\ncolonies over the Stamp Act emphasized the weakness of her general\r\nposition. Barely a year before the _Hawke_ incident the insult by Spain\r\nat the Falkland Islands had brought the two nations to the verge of\r\nrupture, which was believed to have been averted only by the refusal of\r\nLouis XV., then advanced in years, to support the Spanish Bourbons at\r\nthe cost of another war.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances Rodney's report of the occurrences at\r\nCartagena filled the ministry with apprehensions, and brought him from\r\nSandwich an expression of dissatisfaction little removed from a\r\nreprimand. The communication is remarkable rather for what it intimates,\r\nand from the inferences naturally deducible, than for its direct\r\nutterances. \"I cannot help cautioning you, as a friend, to be upon your\r\nguard, to avoid by every justifiable means the drawing this country into\r\na war, which, if it comes on too speedily, I fear we shall have cause to\r\nlament.\" The warning is renewed in a later part of the letter, but in\r\nitself has little significance compared with other hints, rather\r\npersonal than official. \"I cannot conceal from you, that many people\r\nhave industriously spread stories here, that, among the foreign\r\nministers and others, you have expressed your wishes for a Spanish\r\nwar.\" Such expressions--if used--were asserted of the time succeeding\r\nhis appointment to Jamaica, and near his departure for it; for Sandwich\r\nadds, \"This sort of declaration is too little founded on your\r\ninstructions, and too indiscreet, to allow me to give them the least\r\ncredit.\" It is clear, however, that he thought them not improbable,--a\r\nSpanish war was popular with seamen for the prize-money it brought, and\r\nRodney was poor,--for he adds, \"I shall discredit the idea till I have\r\nreceived your answer to this letter.\" He concludes with a warning, not\r\nto be misunderstood, that a war, so far from helping Rodney, would\r\nprobably cause his supersession. \"I will add one word more: Upon a\r\ndeclaration of war larger squadrons must be sent out, and, very\r\nprobably, senior officers to most of our stations in foreign parts.\" In\r\nface of an intimation thus thinly veiled, one scarcely needs to be told\r\nwhat was being said round the table of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThat Rodney would have welcomed war for reasons personal as well as\r\nprofessional, for money and for glory, can readily be believed; but his\r\nmeasures in this case give no ground for such an innuendo as Sandwich\r\nconveyed. Therefore, after making full allowance for the panic of\r\nministers ready to fear the worst, and to throw blame on anybody, it is\r\nthe more significant that he should have been suspected of an unworthy\r\npersonal motive underlying a worthy official act. It is an indication\r\nof reputation already compromised by damaging association with pecuniary\r\nembarrassments; an evidence of latent distrust easily quickened into\r\nactive suspicion. An officer of his rank and service, so far from home,\r\nand with the precedents of his day, could scarcely be faulted for what\r\nhe had done to uphold the honor of the country; and his manner of doing\r\nit was dignified and self-restrained, as well as forcible. There was no\r\nviolence like that of Hawke at Gibraltar, less than twenty years before,\r\nwhich that admiral had boldly vindicated to Pitt himself; but there were\r\nno weak joints in Hawke's armor. In the particular instance, time and\r\ncooler judgment set Rodney right in men's opinion; but subsequent events\r\nshowed that his general reputation did not recover, either then, or\r\nthrough his Jamaica career.\r\n\r\nAfter immediate apprehension had subsided, Rodney's action was justified\r\nby the government. Sandwich wrote him, a little later, that no\r\ncommander-in-chief stood upon a better footing, and assured him that his\r\nprivate interests were safe in his hands. Sandwich, however, was an\r\nextremely practical politician, who had much personal use for his own\r\npatronage; and Rodney's necessities were great. Fulfilment therefore\r\nfell far short of promise. Employment was necessary to the admiral, and\r\nhis hopes fixed upon a colonial governorship when his present\r\nappointment should expire; Jamaica being his first choice. Sandwich\r\nrenewed assurances, but advised a personal application also to the Prime\r\nMinister and other Cabinet officers. New York was mentioned, but nothing\r\ncame of it all. After three years Rodney was superseded, with permission\r\nto remain in the island instead of returning to England. This he\r\ndeclined. \"I cannot bear to think of remaining here in a private\r\nstation, after commanding in chief with the approbation of the whole\r\nisland.\" How far this approbation was universal, or unqualified, is\r\nperhaps doubtful; but the letters quoted by his biographer from his\r\ncorrespondence bear continuous evidence, in this peace employment, of\r\nthe activity and perspicacity of mind characteristic of his more\r\nstrictly military proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1774, Rodney landed again in England, a disappointed man\r\nand in embarrassed circumstances. Professional occupation was almost\r\nhopeless, for in peace times there were few positions for an officer of\r\nhis rank; and, although recognized for able, he had not then the\r\ndistinction by which he is known to us. It is also evident, from\r\nsubsequent events, that he just now lacked the influence necessary to\r\nobtain a preference over rivals in quest of employment. Under the\r\ncircumstances, his debts determined his action, and to escape\r\nharassments he before long passed over into France and settled in Paris.\r\nIn that capital, as in London, he mixed with the best society; and\r\nthere, as before, the mode of life among his associates led him beyond\r\nhis means and involved him in further distresses. Consequently, when war\r\nbetween France and Great Britain became imminent, in 1778, the vigilance\r\nof his creditors prevented his going home in person to offer his\r\nservices. In February of that year, however, he made formal application\r\nto the Admiralty to be sent at a moment's warning on any enterprise. To\r\nthis Sandwich, who was still First Lord, despite his previous assurances\r\nof friendship, paid no attention beyond the formal customary\r\nacknowledgment given to all such letters when they came from officers of\r\nRodney's standing. No indication was shown of intention, or even of\r\nwish, to employ him.\r\n\r\nRodney was therefore compelled to look on idly while others, of\r\nwell-earned reputation indeed but as yet of less experience than himself\r\nin high command, were preferred before him. Howe had already been sent\r\nto North America in 1776, on a mission at once diplomatic and military;\r\nand there he still was when war began. As it became imminent, Keppel was\r\nappointed to the Channel Fleet, and Byron to the North American command,\r\nfrom which Howe had asked to be relieved. All these were junior to\r\nRodney; and, as though to emphasize the neglect of him, rear-admirals\r\nwere sent to the two West India stations, Jamaica and the Leeward\r\nIslands, which he had formerly commanded, and to which it would seem,\r\nfrom one of his letters, that he desired to return. He had, too, now\r\nreached the rank, the want of which had formed the burden of Sandwich's\r\nwarning that he was in danger of supersession at Jamaica; for in a\r\ngeneral flag promotion in January, 1778, he had become Admiral of the\r\nWhite Squadron, than which no higher then obtained, commissions as\r\nAdmirals of the Red not being issued. For this persistent ignoring of an\r\nofficer of his unquestionable ability there were necessarily reasons\r\nmore controlling than appears on the surface; for the naval conditions\r\nand the national emergency called for men of demonstrated high capacity.\r\nSuch Rodney was professionally; and although his age--he was now in his\r\nsixtieth year--was against him, this consideration did not in those days\r\nweigh; nor should it, unless accompanied by probable indication of\r\npowers sapped.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is inevitable that the objection lay in personal record\r\nas bearing upon military efficiency. The Administration, responsible for\r\nresults, knew Rodney's capacity, though its full extent was yet to be\r\nrevealed; the question in their minds clearly must have been, \"Can we\r\ndepend upon its exertion, full, sustained, and disinterested?\" Sandwich,\r\ndespite the coldness with which he had received Rodney's\r\napplication,--going so far as to refuse to support it actively,--was\r\napparently in a minority among his colleagues in believing that they\r\ncould. He declared in the House of Lords that, \"When it was first\r\nproposed in the Council to employ Sir George, I, who knew him from a\r\nvery young man, declared that Rodney _once afloat_ would do his duty.\"\r\nNaval officers will recognize a familiar ring in these words, and will\r\nrecall instances where high professional ability has been betrayed by\r\npersonal foible. Nor does Sandwich stand alone in offering a clue to the\r\nhesitation of the Government. Rodney's biographer and son-in-law quotes\r\nwithout reprobation the account of Mr. Richard Cumberland, who professed\r\nto have interested himself warmly for Rodney's employment and to have\r\nsecured the support of the Secretary for War, Lord George Germaine. \"The\r\nWest India merchants had been alarmed, and clamoured against the\r\nappointment so generally and so decidedly as to occasion no small\r\nuneasiness in my friend and patron, Lord George, and drew from him\r\nsomething that resembled a remonstrance for the risk I had exposed him\r\nto. But in the brilliancy of the capture of Langara's squadron all was\r\ndone away, and past alarms were only recollected to contrast the joy\r\nwhich this success diffused.\" The opposition of the commercial class in\r\nthe West Indies might arise from an officer's over-faithfulness to duty,\r\nas Nelson found to his cost; but it seems clear that in this case\r\ndistrust rested upon personal observation, which raised doubts as to the\r\nsinglemindedness of Rodney's administration of a command. Of the\r\nparticulars of observation or experience from which the feeling sprang,\r\nwe have no information; but St. Eustatius was destined to show that\r\napprehension was not wholly unfounded.\r\n\r\nA summons to active employment would at once have silenced Rodney's\r\ncreditors by the assurance of increase of means, both through regular\r\nincome and probable prize-money; Admiralty neglect left him in fetters.\r\nLady Rodney returned to England to negotiate the means for his\r\nliberation; but the matter dragged, and in the end he owed his release\r\nto the friendly intervention of a French nobleman, the Maréchal Biron,\r\nwho volunteered in warm terms to make him an advance to the amount of\r\n£2,000. This chivalrous offer was for some time declined; but finally\r\nconditions became so threatening, and his position so intolerable, that\r\nhe accepted a loan of about a thousand louis. \"Nothing but a total\r\ninattention to the distressed state I was in,\" he wrote to his wife,\r\n\"could have prevailed upon me to have availed myself of his voluntary\r\nproposal; but not having had, for a month past, a letter from any person\r\nbut Mr. Hotham and yourself, and my passport being expired, it was\r\nimpossible for me to remain in this city at the risk of being sued by my\r\ncreditors, who grew so clamorous it was impossible to bear it; and had\r\nthey not been overawed by the Lieutenant of police, would have carried\r\ntheir prosecutions to the greatest length. Their demands were all\r\nsatisfied this day,\"--May 6th, 1778. Friends in England enabled him to\r\nrepay Biron immediately after his return.\r\n\r\nThis benevolent interference on behalf of a national enemy, although in\r\nits spirit quite characteristic, at once of the country and of the class\r\nto which the individual extending it belonged, has retained a certain\r\nunique flavor of its own among military anecdotes; due undoubtedly to\r\nthe distinction subsequently acquired by Rodney at the expense of the\r\npeople to which his liberator belonged, rather than to anything\r\nexceptional in its nature. As it is, it has acquired a clear\r\npre-eminence among the recorded courtesies of warfare. It is pleasant to\r\nadd that Great Britain had the opportunity in after times to requite\r\nBiron's daughters an act from which she had so greatly benefited. They\r\nhaving sought refuge, though with loss of fortune, from the early\r\nexcesses of the French Revolution, received for some time pensions from\r\nthe British Government.\r\n\r\nRodney came back to England feeling anything but cordial towards\r\nSandwich, whose decided support he had found wanting throughout a very\r\ncritical period of his career. More than any one else the First Lord had\r\nhad both the opportunity and the insight to see his professional value.\r\nTory though Rodney was, he hoped that \"Lord Chatham (Pitt) would be\r\nminister, and another First Lord of the Admiralty be appointed.\" \"We\r\nhear of a change of Administration. I hope it is true, and that I may\r\nhave a chance of being employed, should another be at the Admiralty.\"\r\n\"The refusal of Lord Sandwich does not surprise me. He cannot say but I\r\nhave offered my services, and some friend will let the King know I have\r\nso done.\" Apparently he was to be ignored as well as overlooked.\r\n\r\nCircumstances, however, soon compelled his employment. Sandwich was an\r\nable man, but his personal character inspired mistrust. Not only was he\r\ncontrolled by political considerations in administration; he was\r\nsuspected of corruptly using the Navy for party advantage. Whatever\r\nmight be thought of Byng's conduct, his execution, but twenty years\r\nbefore, was commonly ascribed to political exigency, making him a\r\nvicarious sacrifice to cover the neglects of a Government. As in Byng's\r\ncase, the material of the service was believed to be now inadequate to\r\nthe emergency come upon it; and it was known to have deteriorated\r\ngravely during the seven years of Sandwich's tenure of office. He was a\r\nTory, as were his colleagues of the Cabinet; the leaders of the Navy in\r\nprofessional estimation, Hawke and Keppel, with other distinguished\r\nofficers, were pronounced Whigs, whom it was thought the Administration\r\nwould be willing to destroy. Keppel evidently feared an intention to\r\nruin him by the command of the Channel Fleet, and the public discussion\r\nof the Courts-Martial which followed his indecisive action with\r\nD'Orvilliers, in July, 1778, assumed a decided and rancorous party\r\ntone. His accuser then was his third-in-command, Vice-Admiral Palliser,\r\nwho had left his place on the Admiralty Board to take this position in\r\nthe fleet; and popular outcry charged him with having betrayed his chief\r\nin the battle. So far was professional feeling moved that twelve\r\nprominent admirals,--not all of whom were Whigs,--with Hawke at their\r\nhead, presented to the King a memorial, deprecating \"particularly the\r\nmischief and scandal of permitting men, _who are at once in high office\r\nand subordinate military command_, previous to their making\r\nrecriminating accusations against their commander-in-chief, to attempt\r\nto corrupt the public judgment by the publication of libels on their\r\nofficers in a common newspaper, thereby exciting mutiny in your\r\nMajesty's Navy,\" etc. The words italicized show that this was aimed at\r\nPalliser; and at Sandwich, who inferentially had \"permitted\" his action,\r\nand ultimately rewarded him with the Governorship of Greenwich Hospital.\r\n\r\nIn this demoralized condition of professional sentiment the Admiralty\r\ncould no longer command the services of the best men. Howe came home in\r\ndisgust from America. Keppel threw up the command of the Channel Fleet,\r\nand Barrington subsequently refused it on the expressed ground of\r\nself-distrust, underlying which was real distrust of the ministry. He\r\nwould serve as second, but not as first. Byron, after relieving Howe in\r\nNew York, went to the West Indies, there made a failure, and so came\r\nhome in the summer of 1779. The Channel squadron fell into the hands of\r\nmen respectable, indeed, but in no way eminent, and advanced in years,\r\nwhose tenures of office were comparatively short. Hardy was sixty-three,\r\nGeary seventy; and on both Hawke, who was friendly to them, passed the\r\ncomment that they were \"too easy.\" The first had allowed \"the discipline\r\nof the fleet to come to nothing,\" and he feared the same for the other.\r\nNot until the fall of the ministry, consequent upon Cornwallis's\r\nsurrender, was the post filled by a distinguished name, when Howe took\r\nthe command in 1782.\r\n\r\nThe Administration was thus forced back upon Rodney; fortunately for\r\nitself, for, as far as history has since revealed, there was no other\r\nman then in the service, and of suitable rank, exactly fitted to do the\r\nwork he did. Samuel Hood alone, then an unproved captain, and\r\npractically in voluntary retirement, could have equalled and surpassed\r\nhim. Howe, like Rodney, was an accomplished tactician, and in conception\r\nfar in advance of the standards of the day. In his place he did\r\nadmirable service, which has been too little appreciated, and he was\r\nfortunate in that the work which fell to him, at the first, and again at\r\nthe last of this war, was peculiarly suited to his professional\r\ncharacteristics; but he was not interchangeable with Rodney. In the\r\nlatter there was a briskness of temper, a vivacity, very\r\ndistinguishable from Howe's solidity of persistence; and he was in no\r\nsense one to permit \"discipline to come to nought,\" the direction in\r\nwhich Howe's easy though reserved disposition tended. The West Indies\r\nwere to be the great scene of battles, and, while the tactical ideas of\r\nthe two appear to have been essentially alike, in the common recognition\r\nof combination as imperative to success, the severity of Rodney was\r\nneeded to jerk the West India fleet sharply out of sleepy tradition; to\r\ncompel promptness of manoeuvre and intelligent attention to the\r\nunderlying ideas which signals communicate. Flexibility of movement,\r\nearnestness and rapidity of attack, mutual support by the essential\r\ncoherence of the battle order without too formal precision,--these were\r\nthe qualities which Rodney was to illustrate in practice, and to enforce\r\nby personal impression upon his officers. The official staff of the\r\nfleet had to pass under the rod of the schoolmaster, to receive new\r\nideas, and to learn novel principles of obedience,--to a living chief,\r\nnot to a dead letter crusted over by an unintelligent tradition. Not\r\ntill this step had been made, till discipline had full hold of men's\r\naffections and understanding, was there room for the glorious liberty of\r\naction which Nelson extended to his officers; preaching it in word, and\r\npractising it in act. Hawke re-begat the British Navy in the spirit he\r\nimparted to it; Rodney, first of several, trained its approaching\r\nmaturity in habits which, once acquired, stand by men as principles;\r\nNelson reaped the fulness of the harvest.\r\n\r\nOn October 1, 1779, Rodney was again appointed to the command of the\r\nLeeward Islands Station. The year had been one of maritime misfortune\r\nand discouragement. The French declaration of war in 1778 had been\r\nfollowed by that of Spain in June, 1779; and a huge allied\r\nfleet--sixty-six ships-of-the-line, to which the British could oppose\r\nonly thirty-five--had that summer entered and dominated the English\r\nChannel. Nothing was effected by it, true; but the impression produced\r\nwas profound. In the West Indies Grenada had been lost, and Byron badly\r\nworsted in an attempt to relieve it. On assuming his command, Rodney\r\ncould not but feel that he had more to do than to establish a\r\nreputation; he had a reputation to redeem, and that under a burden of\r\nnational depression which doubly endangered the reputation of every\r\nofficer in responsible position. He must have known that, however\r\nundeservedly, he had not the full confidence of the government, although\r\nparty and personal ties would naturally have predisposed it in his\r\nfavor. He therefore entered upon his career under the necessity to do\r\nand to dare greatly; he had not a strong hand, and needed the more to\r\nplay a game not only strong, but to some extent adventurous.\r\n\r\nTo the radical difference between his personal standing at this opening\r\nof his command, and that which he had at its close, in 1782, may\r\nreasonably be attributed the clear difference in his action at the two\r\nperiods. The first was audacious and brilliant, exhibiting qualities of\r\nwhich he was capable on occasion, but which did not form the groundwork\r\nof his professional character. The display was therefore exceptional,\r\nelicited by exceptional personal emergency. It was vitally necessary at\r\nthe outset, if opportunity offered, to vindicate his selection by the\r\ngovernment; to strike the imagination of the country, and obtain a hold\r\nupon its confidence which could not easily be shaken. This prestige once\r\nestablished, he could safely rest upon it to bear him through doubtful\r\nperiods of suspense and protracted issues. It would have been well had\r\nhe felt the same spur after his great battle in 1782. A necessity like\r\nthis doubtless lies upon every opening career, and comparatively few\r\nthere be that rise to it; but there is an evident distinction to be\r\ndrawn between one in the early prime of life, who may afford to wait,\r\nwho has at least no errors to atone, and him who is about to make his\r\nlast cast, when upon the turning of a die depends a fair opportunity to\r\nshow what is in him. Rodney was near sixty-one, when he took up the\r\ncommand which has given him his well earned place in history.\r\n\r\nHe experienced at once indications of the attitude towards him; and in\r\ntwo directions, from the Admiralty and from his subordinates. A month\r\nbefore he was ready, Sandwich urges him, with evident impatience, to get\r\noff. \"For God's sake, go to sea without delay. You cannot conceive of\r\nwhat importance it is to yourself, to me, and to the public\" (this very\r\norder of importance is suggestive), \"that you should not lose this fair\r\nwind; if you do, I shall not only hear of it in Parliament, but in\r\nplaces to which I pay more attention.... I must once more repeat to you\r\nthat any delay in your sailing will have the most disagreeable\r\nconsequences.\" On the other hand, he had to complain not only of\r\ninattention on the part of the dockyard officials, but of want of zeal\r\nand activity in the officers of the fleet, many of whom behaved with a\r\ndisrespect and want of cordiality which are too often the precursor of\r\nworse faults. Rodney was not the man to put up with such treatment. That\r\nit was offered, and that he for the moment bore with it, are both\r\nsignificant; and are to be remembered in connection with the fast\r\napproaching future.\r\n\r\nGibraltar was then at the beginning of the three years siege, and his\r\nintended departure was utilized to give him command of the first of the\r\nthree great expeditions for its relief, which were among the\r\ncharacteristic operations of this war. He sailed from Plymouth on the\r\n29th of December, 1779, having under him twenty-two sail-of-the-line, of\r\nwhich only four were to continue with him to the West Indies. With this\r\ngreat fleet, and its attendant frigates, went also a huge collection of\r\nstoreships, victuallers, ordnance vessels, troop ships, and merchantmen;\r\nthe last comprising the \"trade\" for Portugal and the West Indies, as the\r\nother classes carried the reinforcements for the Rock.\r\n\r\nOn January 7th, the West India trade parted company off Cape Finisterre,\r\nand the next day began the wonderful good fortune for which Rodney's\r\nlast command was distinguished. It is no disparagement to his merit to\r\nsay that in this he was, to use Ball's phrase about Nelson, \"a\r\nheaven-born admiral.\" A Spanish convoy of twenty-two sail, seven of\r\nwhich were ships of war, the rest laden with supplies for Cadiz, were\r\nsighted at daylight of the 8th, and all taken; not one escaped. Twelve\r\nloaded with provisions were turned into the British convoy, and went on\r\nwith it to feed the Gibraltar garrison. A prince of the blood-royal,\r\nafterwards King William IV., was with the fleet as a midshipman. One of\r\nthe prizes being a line-of-battle ship, Rodney had an opportunity to\r\nshow appositely his courtliness of breeding. \"I have named her the\r\n_Prince William_, in respect to His Royal Highness, in whose presence\r\n_she had the honor to be taken_.\"\r\n\r\nRepeated intelligence had reached the admiral that a Spanish division\r\nwas cruising off Cape St. Vincent. Therefore, when it was sighted at 1\r\nP.M. of January 16th, a week after the capture of the convoy, he was\r\nprepared for the event. A brief attempt to form line was quickly\r\nsucceeded by the signal for a general chase, the ships to engage to\r\nleeward as they came up with the enemy, who, by taking flight to the\r\nsoutheast, showed the intention to escape into Cadiz. The wind was\r\nblowing strong from the westward, giving a lee shore and shoals to the\r\nBritish fleet in the approaching long hours of a wintry night; but\r\nopportunity was winging by, with which neither Rodney nor the Navy could\r\nafford to trifle. He was already laid up with an attack of the gout that\r\ncontinued to harass him throughout this command, and the decision to\r\ncontinue the chase was only reached after a discussion between him and\r\nhis captain, the mention of which is transmitted by Sir Gilbert Blane,\r\nthe surgeon of the ship, who was present professionally. The merit of\r\nthe resolution must remain with the man who bore the responsibility of\r\nthe event; but that he reached it at such a moment only after\r\nconsultation with another, to whom current gossip attributed the chief\r\ndesert, must be coupled with the plausible claim afterwards advanced for\r\nSir Charles Douglas, that he suggested the breaking of the enemy's line\r\non April 12th. Taken together, they indicate at least a common\r\ncontemporary professional estimate of Rodney's temperament. No such\r\nanecdote is transmitted of Hawke. The battle of Cape St. Vincent,\r\ntherefore, is not that most characteristic of Rodney's genius. Judged by\r\nhis career at large, it is exceptional; yet of all his actions it is\r\nthe one in which merit and success most conspicuously met. Nor does it\r\nat all detract from his credit that the enemy was much inferior in\r\nnumbers; eleven to twenty-one. As in Hawke's pursuit of Conflans, with\r\nwhich this engagement is worthy to be classed, what was that night\r\ndared, rightly and brilliantly dared, was the dangers of the deep, not\r\nof the foe. The prey was seized out of the jaws of disaster.\r\n\r\nThe results were commensurate to the risk. The action, which began at 4\r\nP.M., lasted till two the following morning, the weather becoming\r\ntempestuous with a great sea, so that it was difficult to take\r\npossession of the captured vessels. Many of the heavy British ships\r\ncontinued also in danger during the 17th, and had to carry a press of\r\nsail to clear the shoals, on which two of their prizes were actually\r\nwrecked. One Spanish ship-of-the-line was blown up and six struck, among\r\nthem the flag-ship of Admiral Langara, who was taken into Gibraltar.\r\nOnly four escaped.\r\n\r\nTwo such strokes of mingled good fortune and good management, within ten\r\ndays, formed a rare concurrence, and the aggregate results were as\r\nexceptional as the combination of events. Sandwich congratulated Rodney\r\nthat he had already \"taken more line-of-battle ships than had been\r\ncaptured in any one action in either of the two last preceding wars.\"\r\nMilitarily regarded, it had a further high element of praise, for the\r\nenemy's detachment, though in itself inferior, was part of a much\r\nsuperior force; twenty-four allied ships-of-the-line besides it being at\r\nthe moment in Cadiz Bay. It is the essence of military art thus to\r\noverwhelm in detail. A technical circumstance like this was doubtless\r\noverlooked in the general satisfaction with the event, the most evident\r\nfeature in which was the relief of the Government, who just then stood\r\nbadly in need of credit. \"The ministerial people feel it very sensibly,\"\r\nLady Rodney wrote him. \"It is a lucky stroke for them at this juncture.\"\r\nSalutes were fired, and the city illuminated; the press teemed with\r\npoetical effusion. Sandwich, somewhat impudently when the past is\r\nconsidered, but not uncharacteristically regarded as an officeholder,\r\ntook to himself a large slice of the credit. \"The worst of my enemies\r\nnow allow that I have pitched upon a man who knows his duty, and is a\r\nbrave, honest, and able officer.... I have obtained you the thanks of\r\nboth houses of Parliament.\" The letter does not end without a further\r\ncaution against indiscreet talking about the condition of his ships. It\r\nall comes back on the Government, he laments. What Rodney may have said\r\nto others may be uncertain; to his wife, soon after reaching his\r\nstation, he wrote, \"What are the ministers about? Are they determined to\r\nundo their country? Is it fair that the British fleet should be so\r\ninferior to the French, and that the British officers and men are\r\nalways to be exposed to superior numbers? What right had the\r\nadministration to expect anything but defeat?\" Then he passes on to\r\nremark himself, what has been alluded to above, the change in his\r\npersonal position effected by his successes. \"Thank God, I now fear no\r\nfrowns of ministers, and hope never again to stand in need of their\r\nassistance. I know them well. All are alike, and no dependence is to be\r\nplaced on their promises.\" It is to be feared his sense of obligation to\r\nSandwich did not coincide with the latter's estimate.\r\n\r\nIn his official report Rodney gave much credit to his officers for the\r\nSt. Vincent affair. \"The gallant behaviour of the admirals, captains,\r\nofficers and men, I had the honour to command, was conspicuous; they\r\nseemed animated with the same spirit, and were eager to exert themselves\r\nwith the utmost zeal.\" Here also, however, he was biding his time for\r\nobvious reasons; for to his wife he writes, \"I have done them all like\r\nhonour, but it is because I would not have the world believe that there\r\nwere officers slack in their duty. Without a thorough change in naval\r\naffairs, the discipline of our navy will be lost. I could say much, but\r\nwill not. You will hear of it from _themselves_;\" that is, probably, by\r\ntheir mutual recriminations. Such indulgent envelopment of good and bad\r\nalike in a common mantle of commendation is far from unexampled; but it\r\nrarely fails to return to plague its authors, as has been seen in\r\ninstances more recent than that of Rodney. He clearly had told Sandwich\r\nthe same in private letters, for the First Lord writes him, \"I fear the\r\npicture you give of the faction in your fleet is too well drawn. Time\r\nand moderation will by degrees get the better of this bane of\r\ndiscipline. I exceedingly applaud your resolution to shut your ears\r\nagainst the illiberal language of your officers, who are inclined to\r\narraign each other's conduct.\" In this two things are to be remarked:\r\nfirst, the evident and undeniable existence of serious cause of\r\ncomplaint, which was preparing Rodney for the stern self-assertion soon\r\nto be shown; and, second, that such imputations are frequent with him,\r\nwhile he seems in turn to have had a capacity for eliciting\r\ninsubordination of feeling, though he can repress the act. It is a\r\nquestion of personal temperament, which explains more than his relations\r\nwith other men. Hawke and Nelson find rare fault with those beneath\r\nthem; for their own spirit takes possession of their subordinates. Such\r\ndifference of spirit reveals itself in more ways than one in the active\r\nlife of a military community.\r\n\r\nIf there was joy in England over Rodney's achievement, still more and\r\nmore sympathetic was the exultation of those who in the isolation of\r\nGibraltar's Rock, rarely seeing their country's flag save on their own\r\nflagstaff, witnessed and shared the triumph of his entrance there with\r\nhis train of prizes. The ships of war and transports forming the convoy\r\ndid not indeed appear in one body, but in groups, being dispersed by the\r\nlight airs, and swept eastward by the in-drag of the current from the\r\nAtlantic to the Mediterranean; but the presence of the great fleet, and\r\nthe prestige of its recent victory, secured the practical immunity of\r\nmerchant vessels during its stay. Of the first to come in, on January\r\n15th, an eye-witness wrote, \"A ship with the British flag entering the\r\nBay was so uncommon a sight that almost the whole garrison were\r\nassembled at the southward to welcome her in; but words are insufficient\r\nto describe their transports on being informed that she was one of a\r\nlarge convoy which had sailed the latter end of the preceding month for\r\nour relief.\" The admiral himself had been carried beyond and gone into\r\nTetuan, in Morocco, whence he finally arrived on January 26th, having\r\nsent on a supply fleet to Minorca, the garrison of which was undergoing\r\na severance from the outer world more extreme even than that of\r\nGibraltar. Upon the return thence of the convoying ships he again put to\r\nsea, February 13th, with the entire fleet, which accompanied him three\r\ndays sail to the westward, when it parted company for England; he with\r\nonly four ships-of-the-line pursuing his way to his station. On March\r\n27th he reached Santa Lucia, where he found seventeen of-the-line,\r\ncomposing his command. Three weeks later he met the enemy; barely three\r\nmonths, almost to a day, after the affair at St. Vincent.\r\n\r\nThe antecedent circumstances of the war, and the recent history of the\r\nFrench navy, gave a singular opportuneness of occasion, and of personal\r\nfitness, to Rodney's arrival at this moment. The humiliations of the\r\nSeven Years War, with the loss of so much of the French colonial empire,\r\ntraceable in chief measure to naval decadence, had impressed the French\r\ngovernment with the need of reviving their navy, which had consequently\r\nreceived a material development in quality, as well as in quantity,\r\nunparalleled since the days of Colbert and Seignelay, near a century\r\nbefore. Concomitant with this had been a singular progress in the theory\r\nof naval evolutions, and of their handmaid, naval signalling, among\r\nFrench officers; an advance to which the lucid, speculative, character\r\nof the national genius greatly contributed. Although they as yet lacked\r\npractice, and were numerically too few, the French officers were well\r\nequipped by mental resources, by instruction and reflection, to handle\r\nlarge fleets; and they now had large fleets to handle. No such\r\nconjunction had occurred since Tourville; none such recurred during the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nThe condition was unique in naval history of the sail period. To meet\r\nit, assuming an approach to equality in contending fleets, was required,\r\nfirst, a commander-in-chief, and then a competent body of officers. The\r\nlatter the British had only in the sense of fine seamen and gallant men.\r\nIn courage there is no occasion to institute comparisons between the two\r\nnations; in kind there may have been a difference, but certainly not in\r\ndegree. The practical superiority of seamanship in the British may be\r\ntaken as a set-off to the more highly trained understanding of military\r\nprinciples and methods on the part of their enemy. For commander-in-chief,\r\nthere were at this time but two, Howe and Rodney, whose professional\r\nequipment, as shown in practice, fitted them to oppose the French methods.\r\nOf these Rodney was the better, because possessed of a quicker power of\r\ninitiative, and also of that personal severity required to enforce strict\r\nconformity of action among indifferent or sullen subordinates.\r\n\r\nRodney has therefore a singularly well defined place among British naval\r\nchiefs. He was to oppose form to form, theory to theory, evolution to\r\nevolution, upon the battle ground of the sea; with purpose throughout\r\ntactically offensive, not defensive, and facing an adversary his equal\r\nin professional equipment. Had he arrived a year before he would have\r\nmet no fair match in D'Estaing, a soldier, not a sailor, whose\r\ndeficiencies as a seaman would have caused a very different result from\r\nthat which actually followed his encounter with Byron, who in conduct\r\nshowed an utter absence of ideas and of method inconceivable in Rodney.\r\nThe French were now commanded by De Guichen, considered the most capable\r\nof their officers by Rodney, whose recent abode in Paris had probably\r\nfamiliarized him with professional reputations among the enemy.\r\nEverything therefore conspired to make the occasion one eminently fitted\r\nto his capacities. Such are the conditions--the man _and_ the hour--that\r\nmake reputations; though they do not form characters, which are growths\r\nof radically different origin.\r\n\r\nDe Guichen put to sea from Martinique on April 15th, with a convoy for\r\nSanto Domingo which he intended to see clear of British interference.\r\nRodney, whose anchorage was but thirty miles away, learned instantly the\r\nFrench sailing and followed without delay. On the evening of April 16th,\r\nthe two fleets were in sight of each other to leeward of Martinique, the\r\nBritish to windward; an advantage that was diligently maintained during\r\nthe night. At daylight of the 17th the two enemies were twelve to\r\nfifteen miles apart, ranged on nearly parallel lines, the British twenty\r\nheading northwest, the French twenty-three southeast. The numerical\r\ndifference represents sufficiently nearly the actual difference of\r\nforce, although French vessels averaged more powerful than British of\r\nthe same rates.\r\n\r\nAt 6.45 A.M. Rodney signalled that it was his intention to attack the\r\nenemy's rear with his whole force. This was never annulled, and the\r\npurpose governed his action throughout the day. This combination--on the\r\nrear--is the one generally preferable to be attempted when underway, and\r\nthe relative situations of the fleets at this moment made it\r\nparticularly opportune; for the British, in good order, two cables\r\ninterval between the ships, were abreast the rear centre and rear of the\r\nenemy, whose line was in comparison greatly extended,--the result\r\nprobably of inferior practical seamanship. To increase his advantage,\r\nRodney at 7 ordered his vessels to close to one cable, and at 8.30, when\r\nthe antagonists were still heading as at daybreak, undertook to lead the\r\nfleet down by a series of signals directive of its successive movements.\r\nIn this he was foiled by De Guichen, who by wearing brought what was\r\npreviously his van into position to support the extreme threatened. \"The\r\ndifferent movements of the enemy,\" wrote Rodney, \"obliged me to be very\r\nattentive and watch every opportunity of attacking them at advantage;\" a\r\nsentence that concisely sums up his special excellencies, of which the\r\npresent occasion offers the most complete illustration. It may be fully\r\nconceded also that it would have vindicated his high title to fame by\r\nconspicuous results, had the intelligence of his officers seconded his\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\nThe forenoon passed in manoeuvres, skilfully timed, to insure a definite\r\nissue. At 11.50 Rodney considered that his opportunity had arrived.\r\nBoth fleets were then heading in the same direction, on the starboard\r\ntack, and he had again succeeded in so placing his own that, by the\r\nwords of his report, he expected to bring \"the whole force of His\r\nMajesty's fleet against the enemy's rear, and of course part of their\r\ncentre, by which means the twenty sail of British ships would have been\r\nopposed to only fifteen sail of the enemy's, and must in all probability\r\nhave totally disabled them before their van could have given them any\r\nassistance.\" It would be difficult to cite a clearer renouncement of the\r\noutworn \"van to van,\" ship to ship, dogma; but Rodney is said to have\r\nexpressed himself in more emphatic terms subsequently, as follows:\r\n\"During all the commands Lord Rodney has been entrusted with, he made it\r\na rule to bring his whole force against a part of the enemy's, and never\r\nwas so absurd as to bring ship against ship, when the enemy gave him an\r\nopportunity of acting otherwise.\" Though not distinctly so stated, it\r\nwould seem that his first movement on the present occasion had failed\r\nbecause of the long distance between the fleets permitting the enemy to\r\nsuccor the part threatened, before he could close. He was now nearer,\r\nfor at this second attempt only an hour proved to be needed for the\r\nfirst British ship to open fire at long range. It may be for this\r\nreason, also, that he at this stage threw himself upon his captains, no\r\nlonger prescribing the successive movements, but issuing the general\r\nsignal to bear down, each vessel to \"steer,\" according to the 21st\r\nArticle of the _Additional_ Fighting Instructions, \"for the ship of the\r\nenemy which from the disposition of the two squadrons it must be her lot\r\nto engage, notwithstanding the signal for the line ahead will be kept\r\nflying: making or shortening sail in such proportion as _to preserve the\r\ndistance assigned by the signal for the line_, in order that the whole\r\nsquadron may, as near as possible, come into action at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for his manoeuvre, the Admiral here ran up against the\r\nstolid idea of the old--and still existing--Fighting Instructions\r\nconcerning the line-of-battle in action, embodied in a typical\r\nrepresentative in the senior captain of his fleet. This gentleman,\r\nRobert Carkett, had risen from before the mast, and after a lieutenancy\r\nof thirteen years had become post in 1758, by succeeding to the command\r\nwhen his captain was killed, in one of the most heroic single-ship\r\nfights of the British navy. Unluckily, his seniority gave him the lead\r\nof the fleet as it was now formed on the starboard tack, and he\r\nconsidered that the signal for attacking the enemy's rear was annulled\r\nby the present situation. \"Both fleets,\" he stated in a letter to the\r\nAdmiralty, \"were at 11.15 parallel to and abreast of each other. As I\r\nwas then the leading ship, it became my duty to engage the leading ship\r\nof the French fleet, as this signal disannulled all former ones\r\nrelative to the mode of attack.\" The word \"abreast,\" critically used,\r\nwould imply that the fleets were abreast, ship to ship, van to van; but\r\nthere appears no reason to question Rodney's statement of the facts made\r\nto Carkett himself: \"Forgetting that the signal for the line was only at\r\ntwo cables length distance from each other, the van division was by you\r\nled to more than two leagues distance from the centre division, which\r\nwas thereby exposed to the greatest strength of the enemy, and not\r\nproperly supported.\" Rodney, in short, meant by opposite the enemy's\r\nship opposite at the moment the signal was made; and he also expected\r\nthat the movements of his ships would be further controlled by the words\r\nof the 21st Article, \"preserve the distance assigned by the signal for\r\nthe line,\" which distance was to be taken from the centre; or, as\r\nsometimes worded in the Instructions, \"the distance shall be that\r\nbetween the admiral and the ships next ahead and astern of him.\" Carkett\r\nconceived that he was to attack the ship opposite him in numerical\r\norder, that is, the leader of the enemy, and that the remaining British\r\nwould take distance from him.\r\n\r\nWhy the rest of the van should also have been led thus astray can be\r\nexplained only on the ground that Carkett's general views were shared by\r\nthe divisional commander, a rear-admiral, who, as was proved a year\r\nlater, possessed high courage of the pure game-cock order, but was\r\nwholly thoughtless of gaining an unfair advantage, two against one, by\r\ntactical ingenuity. The result was that the van as a body left the\r\ncentre to itself, and thereby not only wrecked the concentration at\r\nwhich Rodney aimed, but was out of hand to support his flag and his\r\ndivision, when badly battered by the enemy's fire. This was the great\r\ntactical blunder which brought to nought Rodney's patient, wary\r\nmanoeuvres of the past six hours. To it especially, but not to it alone,\r\nhe referred in the stinging words of his despatch: \"'T is with concern\r\ninexpressible, mixt with indignation, that the duty I owe my sovereign\r\nand country obliges me to acquaint their Lordships that, during the\r\naction with the French fleet on the 17th instant [and] His Majesty's,\r\nthe British flag was not properly supported.\" To the specific error of\r\nthe van was added a widespread disregard of the order for close action,\r\ndespite the example of the commander-in-chief, who pressed the enemy so\r\nhard that towards the end his flag-ship was to leeward of De Guichen's\r\nwake. \"Perceiving several of our ships engaging at a distance, I\r\nrepeated the signal for close action. With truth, but sorrow, I must say\r\nit was little attended to.\" It is noticeable that one of the ships thus\r\ncensured, the _Cornwall_, next ahead of Rodney, lost as heavily in\r\nkilled and wounded as did the flag-ship herself; one of many instances\r\nshowing that distance lessened efficiency without increasing safety. The\r\nforwardness of Rodney's flag on this occasion proves clearly enough his\r\nconsciousness that tactics, to succeed, must be more than a veil for\r\ntimidity; that hard hitting is as essential as skilful leading.\r\n\r\nThis combination of steady, patient, wary, skilful guidance, with\r\nresolute and tenacious personal leadership, constituted the firm tissue\r\nof Rodney's professional character, and at no time received such clear\r\nillustration as in the case before us; for no like opportunity recurred.\r\nOne experience was enough for De Guichen; he did not choose again to\r\nyield the advantage of the weather gage, and he had the tactical skill\r\nnecessary to retain it in his future contacts with this adversary. The\r\nbattle of April 12, 1782, upon which Rodney's fame has rested, was\r\nrather an accident than an achievement, and as a revelation of character\r\nits most conspicuous feature is wariness exaggerated into professional\r\ntimidity. He himself has weighed the relative professional value of the\r\ntwo affairs. A letter published in 1809, anonymous, but bearing strong\r\ninternal evidence of being written by Sir Gilbert Blane, long on a\r\ntrusted physician's terms of intimacy with Rodney, states that he\r\n\"thought little of his victory on the 12th of April.\" He would have\r\npreferred to rest his reputation upon this action with De Guichen, and\r\n\"looked upon that opportunity of beating, with an inferior fleet, such\r\nan officer, whom he considered the best in the French service, as one by\r\nwhich, but for the disobedience of his captains, he might have gained\r\nan immortal renown.\"\r\n\r\nThe misconduct of his officers brought out in full vigor the severity\r\nwhich was a salient feature of Rodney's professional character. In the\r\nSt. Vincent business he may have been partly actuated to spare, by the\r\nreflection that the offenders were not his own captains; that they were\r\nabout to quit him finally. Moreover, there had been then a very\r\nconsiderable tangible success; results cover a multitude of sins. No\r\nsuch extenuations applied here. The wreck of his reasonable hopes of\r\npersonal distinction coincided with failure towards the nation itself.\r\nRodney's hand came down heavy upon the offenders; but so far as seen it\r\nwas the hand always of a gentleman. In private letters his full feelings\r\nbetrayed themselves in vehemence; but in public they were measured to\r\nausterity. To Carkett, when questioned concerning the rumored\r\nexpressions in his despatch, he is withering in the pointed enumeration\r\nof varied shortcomings; but he never lapses into a breach of\r\nprofessional decorum of utterance. The unfortunate man represented to\r\nthe Admiralty his view of the matter,--already cited; but it bears no\r\nindorsement to show that it had passed under Rodney's eye. Captain,\r\nship, and ship's company, were swept away a few months later in the\r\nmemorable hurricane of October, 1780.\r\n\r\nThe despatch specified no other delinquent by name; but the selection\r\nof five captains to receive personal commendation, and the persistent\r\nrefusal of the same to all other subordinates, including the junior\r\nflag-officers, made censure sufficiently individual; and the admiral's\r\nsubsequent line of conduct emphasized rebuke bitterly. The cruise was\r\nnot yet finished; for the French having taken refuge at Guadaloupe, it\r\nwas important to prevent them from regaining Martinique, their chief\r\ndepot and place of repairs. To intercept them there, Rodney at first\r\ntook station off Fort Royal, and when compelled for a moment to return\r\nto Santa Lucia, kept lookouts to warn him betimes of the enemy's\r\nappearance. So, when De Guichen approached from the windward side of the\r\nislands, on May 9th, he found the British getting underway to meet him.\r\nFrom that time until the 20th--eleven days--the fleets were manoeuvring\r\nin sight of one another, beating to windward; the British endeavoring to\r\nforce action, the French to avoid it. De Guichen's orders from home were\r\n\"to keep the sea, so far as the force maintained by England in the\r\nWindward Islands would permit, _without too far compromising_ the fleet\r\nentrusted to him.\" Such instructions compelled him to defensive tactics;\r\nas Rodney's views, and those traditional in his service, impelled him to\r\nattack. Hence ensued a struggle of sustained vigilance, activity, and\r\nskill, profoundly interesting professionally, but which does not lend\r\nitself to other than technical narrative. \"For fourteen days and\r\nnights,\" wrote Rodney, \"the fleets were so near each other that neither\r\nofficers nor men could be said to sleep. Nothing but the goodness of the\r\nweather and climate could have enabled us to endure so continual a\r\nfatigue. Had it been in Europe, half the people must have sunk under it.\r\nFor my part, it did me good.\" No evidence of professional aptness could\r\nbe given clearer than the last words. A man is easy under such\r\ncircumstances only when they fit him. De Guichen asked to be superseded;\r\n\"my health cannot endure such continual fatigue and anxiety.\" Twice the\r\nwary Frenchman was nearly caught, but the wind did not favor Rodney long\r\nenough to give him the weather position, the only sure one for offence.\r\nBut, while thus unable to compass results, he gave conclusive evidence\r\nof the quickness of his eye, the alertness of his action, and the\r\nflexibility which he was enabled to impress upon his fleet by sheer\r\nforce of personal character. The contest resembled that of two expert\r\nswordsmen; more intermittent doubtless, but also much more prolonged.\r\n\r\nThere can be no trifling with such conditions. A moment's relaxation, or\r\ninaptness, may forfeit opportunity, offered only by chance and not to be\r\nregained by effort. Rodney was fixed that no such slip should occur\r\nthrough the neglect of others, and his stern supervision, as represented\r\nby himself to his wife, was that of a slave driver, lash in hand. \"As I\r\nhad given public notice to all my captains, etc. that I should hoist my\r\nflag on board one of my frigates, and that I expected implicit obedience\r\nto every signal made, under the certain penalty of being instantly\r\nsuperseded, it had an admirable effect, as they were all convinced,\r\nafter their late gross behaviour, that they had nothing to expect at my\r\nhands but instant punishment to those who neglected their duty. My eye\r\non them had more dread than the enemy's fire, and they knew it would be\r\nfatal. No regard was paid to rank,--admirals as well as captains, if out\r\nof their station, were instantly reprimanded by signals, or messages\r\nsent by frigates: and, in spite of themselves, I taught them to be what\r\nthey had never been before--_officers_: and showed them that an inferior\r\nfleet, properly conducted, was more than a match for one far superior.\"\r\nMaking allowance for exaggeration in the irresponsible utterances of\r\nfamily life, the above is eminently characteristic of temperament. It\r\nmust be added, as equally characteristic of an underlying justice which\r\nRodney possessed, that in his official account of these last manoeuvres\r\nhe gave credit to his subordinates as a whole. \"I must inform their\r\nLordships, in justice to the commanders and officers of the fleet under\r\nmy command, that since the action of the 17th of April, and during the\r\npursuit of the enemy's fleet, and in the two rencontres with them, all\r\nmy officers, of every rank and denomination, were obedient and attentive\r\nto orders and signals, and, I am convinced, if the enemy had given them\r\nan opportunity, they would have done their duty to their King and\r\nCountry.\" The claims of justice against its own strict requirements he\r\nalso recognized to Carkett. \"Nothing but the former service you had done\r\nyour King and Country, and my firm belief of your being a brave man,\r\ncould have induced me, as commander of a great fleet, to overlook.\" It\r\nwill not escape attention that this exact observance of credit, where\r\ndue, lends increased weight to censure, when inflicted.\r\n\r\nTo the pursuit of the French fleet, relinquished forty leagues eastward\r\nof Martinique after the brush of May 19th, succeeded a period marked\r\nonly by the routine administrative cares attendant upon an admiral\r\ncharged with the defence of a lengthy, exposed chain of islands, and an\r\nextensive trade, against enemies numerically much superior. The details\r\nserve to show the breadth of intelligence, the sound judgment, and clear\r\nprofessional conceptions that characterized Rodney in small things as\r\nwell as great; but it would be wearisome to elaborate demonstration of\r\nthis, and these qualities he had in common with many men otherwise\r\ninferior to himself. Reaction from the opening strain of the campaign,\r\nwith the relaxation of vigor from the approach of the hot rainy season,\r\nnow began to tell on his health; and to this contributed the harassment\r\nof mind due to the arrival of a large Spanish fleet, while\r\nreinforcements promised him unaccountably failed to appear.\r\nNevertheless, his personal efficiency was not impaired, and towards the\r\nend of July he resolved to execute a project which he had long\r\nentertained, of carrying the mass of his fleet from the islands to the\r\nContinental waters of North America.\r\n\r\nDuring the year between his return from Paris and his present\r\nappointment, he had laid before the Admiralty two papers, containing an\r\nadmirable summary of the leading strategic conditions of the whole scene\r\nof war in the western hemisphere, with suggestions for action amounting\r\nto a plan of campaign. One feature of this was based upon the weather\r\ndifferences, which rendered cruising dangerous in the West Indies when\r\nmost favorable to the northward, and unsure in North America when most\r\ncertain among the islands. He proposed to utilize this alternation of\r\nseasons, by shifting a mobile reinforcement suddenly and secretly from\r\none end to the other of the long front of operations. This is a common\r\nenough expedient in military art, but had rarely received the convincing\r\nformulation which he gave it; while that such a conception was a novelty\r\nto the average naval mind of the day, may be inferred from the startled\r\nwrath of the admiral in North America at Rodney's unexpected intrusion\r\nupon his bailiwick.\r\n\r\nSandwich, however, had entertained the project, and in October, 1779,\r\njust as Rodney's appointment issued, a vessel sailed from England with\r\nletters to Admiral Arbuthnot in New York, directing him to send several\r\nships-of-the-line to the West Indies for the winter campaign. The vessel\r\nlost a mast, kept off to Nassau in the Bahamas, and after arrival there\r\nher captain, while spending some months in repairs, did not think to\r\nsend on the despatches. Arbuthnot, therefore, received them only on\r\nMarch 16, 1780; too late, doubtless, to collect and equip a force in\r\ntime to reach Rodney before the affair of April 17th.\r\n\r\nAt the end of July, 1780, the conditions in the West Indies were that\r\nthe allied French and Spanish fleets had gone to leeward from\r\nMartinique; to Havana, and to Cap François, in Hayti. At the latter port\r\nwas assembling a large trade convoy--three hundred ships, according to\r\nRodney's information. He reasoned that this must go to Europe, but would\r\nnot require the full strength of the French fleet; therefore,\r\ntransferring his own insight to the enemy's mind, he convinced himself\r\nthat a part of their vessels would seek Narragansett Bay, to reinforce\r\nthe seven ships-of-the-line that had reached there on July 12th, under\r\nDe Ternay, of whose arrival Rodney now knew. Great possibilities might\r\nbe open to such a combination, skilfully handled against the inferior\r\nnumbers of Arbuthnot. \"As it plainly appeared to me that His Majesty's\r\nterritory, fleet, and army, in America were in imminent danger of being\r\noverpowered by the superior force of the public enemy, I deemed it a\r\nduty incumbent upon me to forego any emoluments that might have accrued\r\nby the enterprise intended by General Vaughan and myself during the\r\nhurricane months, and without a moment's hesitation flew with all\r\ndespatch possible to prevent the enemy's making any impression upon the\r\ncontinent before my arrival there.\" The protestation of\r\ndisinterestedness here is somewhat intrusive, and being wholly\r\nunnecessary excites rather criticism than confidence.\r\n\r\nAlthough reasonable precautions had been taken for the security of his\r\nown station, and all circumstances carefully weighed, there was in this\r\nstep of Rodney's an assumption of responsibility,--of risk,--as in his\r\nsimilar action of 1762, before noted. This, as well as the military\r\ncorrectness of the general conception, deserves to be noted to the\r\ncredit of his professional capacity. Making the land about Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina, he swept along the coast to the northward, until he\r\nanchored off Sandy Hook, September 14th. The following day he issued an\r\norder to Admiral Arbuthnot, directing him to put himself under his\r\ncommand and to obey his instructions.\r\n\r\nRodney's coming was a grievous blow to Washington, who instead had\r\nhoped, as Rodney had feared, the arrival of De Guichen, or at the least\r\nof a strong French naval division. The enemy's disappointment is perhaps\r\nthe best proof of sagacity in a military movement, but Sandwich's clear\r\napproval was also forthcoming. \"It is impossible for us to have a\r\nsuperior fleet in every part; and unless our commanders-in-chief will\r\ntake the great line, as you do, and consider the King's whole dominions\r\nas under their care, our enemies must find us unprepared somewhere, and\r\ncarry their point against us.\" Arbuthnot, nevertheless, saw only\r\npersonal injury to himself; a natural feeling, but one which should not\r\nbe allowed display. Rodney had given various particular orders, and had\r\nsuggested that it would be better that the commander-in-chief on the\r\nstation should keep headquarters at New York, leaving the blockade of\r\nTernay, a hundred and thirty miles distant, to a junior admiral; also,\r\nhe intimated the opinion that such a blockade would be better conducted\r\nunderway than anchored in Gardiner's Bay, fifty miles from the enemy's\r\nport. Though suggestion did not override discretion, Arbuthnot resented\r\nit in all its forms. After explaining his reasons, he added, \"How far,\r\nSir, your conduct (similarly circumstanced as you are) is praiseworthy\r\nand proper, consequences must determine. Your partial interference in\r\nthe conduct of the American War is certainly incompatible with\r\nprinciples of reason, and precedents of service. The frigates attending\r\non a cruising squadron you have taken upon you to counter-order, (a due\r\nrepresentation of which and other circumstances I shall make where it\r\nwill have every possible effect), and thus I have been for some time\r\nwithout even a repeater of signals.\"\r\n\r\nThough Rodney's step was unusual, his position as Arbuthnot's superior\r\nofficer, locally present, was impregnable. He nevertheless kept his\r\ntemper under provocation, and the dignified restraint of his reply is\r\nnotable; indeed, the only significant feature of this incident, from the\r\nbiographical point of view. \"No offence to you was intended on my part.\r\nEvery respect due to you, as an officer and a gentleman, my inclination\r\nas well as my duty led me to pay you in the strictest sense.\" He leaves\r\nno doubt, however, that he does not intend to allow his functions to\r\nlapse into a mere official primacy,--that he will rule, as well as\r\nreign. \"Duty, not inclination, brought me to North America. I came to\r\ninterfere in the American War, to command by sea in it, and to do my\r\nbest endeavours towards the putting an end thereto. I knew the dignity\r\nof my own rank entitled me to take the supreme command, which I ever\r\nshall do on every station where His Majesty's and the public service may\r\nmake it necessary for me to go, unless I meet a superior officer, in\r\nwhich case it will be my duty to obey his orders.\" He then proceeds to\r\nexercise his authority, by explicit directions and some criticism of\r\nexisting arrangements.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, in submitting the papers to the Admiralty, Rodney wrote, \"I\r\nam ashamed to mention what appears to me the real cause, and from\r\nwhence Mr. Arbuthnot's chagrin proceeds, but the proofs are so plain\r\nthat prize-money is the occasion that I am under the necessity of\r\ntransmitting them. I can solemnly assure their Lordships that I had not\r\nthe least conception of any other prize-money on the coast of America\r\nbut that which would be most honourably obtained by the destruction of\r\nthe enemy's ships of war and privateers--but when prize-money appeared\r\npredominant in the mind of my brother officer, I was determined to have\r\nmy share of that bounty so graciously bestowed by His Majesty and the\r\npublic.\" Nelson's retort to Arbuthnot's successor, two years later, may\r\nbe recalled. \"You have come to a good station for prize-money.\" \"Yes,\r\nbut the West Indies is the station for honour.\"\r\n\r\nThe visit to continental waters was on this occasion productive of\r\nlittle result. Contrary alike to Rodney's anticipations and those of\r\nWashington, De Guichen's whole fleet had returned to Europe. Some slight\r\nredistribution of cruisers, the more frequent capture of privateers,\r\nwith increased security to the trade of New York and incidental support\r\nto some rather predatory land operations, were all that Rodney could\r\nshow of tangible consequence from his presence. Arbuthnot alone was\r\nsuperior to Ternay if neither received reinforcements. Rodney's health\r\nfelt the keener atmosphere, so that he had to go ashore in New York, and\r\nhe accepted the views of Arbuthnot as to the strength of the French\r\nfleet's position in Newport, without examining it himself. Had he done\r\nso, however, it is unlikely that he would have formed more strenuous\r\npurposes. The disposition of the enemy's squadron there was so imposing\r\nthat only the genius of a Nelson, mindful as at Revel of the moral\r\ninfluence of a great blow at a critical period of the war, could have\r\nrisen to the necessity of daring such a hazard. His phrase was there\r\napplicable, \"Desperate affairs require desperate remedies.\" There is no\r\nindication of this supreme element in Rodney's composition. It is\r\ninteresting to note, however, that personal observation had given\r\nconviction of success at Newport to the officer who was afterwards\r\nNelson's gallant second at Copenhagen,--Sir Thomas Graves.\r\n\r\nThis paucity of results in no way lessens the merit of the movement from\r\nthe West Indies to the continent. It was indubitably correct in idea,\r\nand, as has been pointed out, the conception was Rodney's own, the\r\npossibilities were great, the risk in many ways undeniable; when these\r\ncan be affirmed of a military action, failure to obtain results, because\r\nconditions take an improbable direction, does not detract from credit.\r\nNor should the obviousness of this measure hide the fact that the\r\nsuggestion appears to have been original with him, occurring fully\r\ndeveloped in his memorandum of May, 1778, to the Admiralty; whether\r\nwritten in Paris or England does not appear. The transfer of Hotham's\r\nsquadron to the southward in the following December, 1779, enabling\r\nBarrington to conquer Santa Lucia,--a place insisted upon in the same\r\nmemorandum as of the first importance,--may not improbably be attributed\r\nto this fruitful paper. In the next year, 1781, a detachment was again\r\nsent to New York, and had Rodney been able to accompany it in person\r\nthere is no room to doubt that he would have saved Cornwallis; reversing\r\nissues, at least momentarily, certainly prolonging the war, possibly\r\ndeciding the contest otherwise than as befell.\r\n\r\nRodney's return to the West Indies in December, 1780, concluded the most\r\neventful and illustriously characteristic year of his life. The\r\ndestruction of Langara's fleet in January, the brilliant tactical\r\ndisplays of April 17th, and of the chase manoeuvres in May, the\r\nstrategic transference in August of a large division, unawares to the\r\nenemy, from one point of the field of action to another, are all feats\r\nthat testify to his great ability as a general officer. Nor should there\r\nbe left out of the account the stern dignity of conduct which assured\r\nhis personal control of the fleet, his certainty of touch in the face of\r\nan enemy. Thus considered, it was a year full of events, successful\r\nthroughout as regards personal desert, and singularly significant of\r\nability and temperament.\r\n\r\nThe year 1781 was far less happy, nor does the great victory, which in\r\n1782 crowned his career with glory, contribute to the enhancement of his\r\nprofessional distinction; rather the contrary. Upon reaching Barbados,\r\nDecember 5th, he found the island shorn to the ground by the noted\r\nhurricane, which in the previous October had swept the Caribbean, from\r\nthe Lesser Antilles to Jamaica. Eight of the division left by him in the\r\nWest Indies had been wrecked,--two being ships-of-the-line; and the\r\nefficiency of the whole fleet was grievously impaired by the widespread\r\ninjury to vessels.\r\n\r\nAn event charged with more serious consequences to himself soon\r\nfollowed. On the 27th of January, 1781, at Barbados, despatches from the\r\nAdmiralty notified him that Great Britain had declared war against\r\nHolland, and directed him to proceed at once against the Dutch shipping\r\nand West Indies. First among the enumerated objects of attack was the\r\nsmall island of St. Eustatius. This, having enjoyed the advantages of\r\nneutrality at a time when almost the whole Caribbean was in hostilities,\r\nhad become a depot for the accumulation and distribution of stores,\r\ncommercial and warlike. Ostensibly, it served all parties, giving to and\r\nreceiving from Europe, America, and the Caribbean alike. The political\r\nsympathies of Holland, however, and it may be added those of the West\r\nIndies in general, even of the British islands themselves, were rather\r\nadverse to Great Britain in the current struggle; and this, combined\r\nwith the greater self-sufficingness of the British naval and commercial\r\nadministration, had made the neutral support of St. Eustatius more\r\nbenevolent, and much more useful, to the enemies of Great Britain,\r\nincluding the revolted colonists, than it was to the mother country.\r\nRodney asserted that help from there was readily forthcoming to supply\r\nFrench and Spanish requirements, while professions of inability abounded\r\nwhenever his fleet made a demand in occasional emergencies.\r\n\r\nHe was therefore full of gall against the island and its merchants, the\r\nmore so because he suspected that British subjects, unpatriotically\r\nardent for gain, were largely concerned in maintaining conditions thus\r\nhurtful to their country; and, when the orders to act came, it needed\r\nbut three days for himself and General Vaughan to sail on an errand of\r\nwhich they probably had previous intimations. On the 3d of February they\r\narrived off St. Eustatius, which in the face of their imposing force\r\nsubmitted at once. They took possession of the island, with goods stored\r\nto the estimated value of £3,000,000,--an immense spoil in those days. A\r\nDutch ship-of-war, with a hundred and fifty sail of traders of various\r\nnationalities, were also seized; while a convoy of thirty merchant\r\nships, which had sailed thirty-six hours before, was pursued and\r\ncaptured by a British detachment,--the Dutch admiral commanding the\r\nships-of-war being killed in the attendant action.\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view this was an enormous success, though unproductive\r\nof glory. It destroyed at a blow a centre of commerce and supply\r\npowerfully contributive to the maintenance of the enemies of Great\r\nBritain; both to their hostile operations, and to the indirect but no\r\nless vital financial support that trade gives to national endurance,--to\r\nthe sinews of war. Besides this, however, there was the unprecedented\r\nimmediate booty, transferable as so much asset to the conquerors. It was\r\nupon this present tangible result that Rodney's imagination fastened,\r\nwith an engrossment and tenacity that constitute a revelation of\r\ncharacter. It perverted his understanding of conditions, and paralyzed\r\nhis proper action as commander-in-chief. It is needless in this\r\nconnection to consider whether it was the matter of personal profit,\r\nthrough legitimate prize-money, that thus influenced him,--an effect to\r\nsome extent pardonable in a man who had long suffered, and still was\r\nsuffering, from pecuniary straitness,--or whether, as he loudly\r\nprotested, it was the interest to the nation that made his personal\r\nsuperintendence of the proceeds imperative. In either case the point to\r\nbe noted is not a palpable trait of covetousness,--if such it were,\r\n--but the limitation to activity occasioned by preoccupation with a\r\nrealized, but imperfect, success. The comparatively crude impression of\r\ngreediness, produced by apparent absorption in a mere money gain, has\r\nprevented the perception of this more important and decisive element in\r\nRodney's official character, revealed at St. Eustatius and confirmed on\r\nthe evening of the 12th of April. What he had won, he had won; what more\r\nhe might and should do, he would not see, nor would he risk.\r\n\r\nHis discontent with his junior flag-officers in the West Indies, and the\r\npeculiar demoralization of professional tone at the moment, had made it\r\ndifficult for the Admiralty to provide him a satisfactory second in\r\ncommand. In order to do this, they had \"to make a promotion,\" as the\r\nphrase went; that is, in order to get the man wanted, the seniors on the\r\ncaptains' list were promoted down to and including him. The choice had\r\nfallen on Sir Samuel Hood,--in later days Nelson's honored Lord\r\nHood,--than which none could have been happier in respect of capacity.\r\nIt has been truly said that he was as able as Rodney, and more\r\nenergetic; but even this falls short of his merit. He had an element of\r\nprofessional--as distinguished from personal--daring, and an imaginative\r\nfaculty that penetrated the extreme possibilities of a situation,\r\nquickened by the resolve, in which Rodney was deficient, to have all or\r\nnothing; and these invaluable traits were balanced by the sound and\r\naccurate judgment of a thorough seaman, without which imagination lures\r\nto disaster. The man who as a junior formed the idea of seizing De\r\nGrasse's anchorage in the Chesapeake in 1781, to effect the relief of\r\nCornwallis, and who in 1782, when momentarily in chief command,\r\nillustrated the idea by actual performance under similar conditions in\r\nthe West Indies, rose to heights of conception and of achievement for\r\nwhich we have no equivalent in Rodney's career. Unfortunately for him,\r\nthough thus mighty in act, opportunity for great results never came to\r\nhim. The hour never met the man.\r\n\r\nHood with eight ships-of-the-line and a large convoy arrived on the\r\nstation in January, 1781, and was at St. Eustatius with the\r\ncommander-in-chief when Rodney received a report, which proved to be\r\nfalse, that eight to ten French ships-of-the-line, with a numerous\r\nsupply-fleet, had been sighted in European waters evidently bound for\r\nthe West Indies. He thereupon detached Hood, on February 12th, and\r\ndirected him with seventeen of-the-line to await the enemy to windward\r\nof Martinique, their probable destination. A month later he ordered the\r\nposition to be shifted to leeward of the island, in front of the French\r\narsenal port, Fort Royal. Hood dissented from this, remonstrating\r\nvigorously, and the event proved him right; but Rodney insisted, the\r\nmore injudiciously in that he was throwing the tactical burden upon his\r\njunior while fettering thus his tactical discretion. Meantime, twenty\r\nFrench ships-of-the-line did sail on March 22d for Martinique, under\r\nCount De Grasse: beginning then the campaign which ended in the great\r\ndisaster of April 12, 1782, but not until it had been signalized by the\r\nsurrender of Cornwallis, due to this fleet, as Washington said. On the\r\n28th of April it came in sight of Hood; but, owing to the leewardly\r\nposition insisted upon by Rodney, the English commander could not\r\nprevent the junction to it of four French ships then in the port. A\r\nbattle followed next day, of eighteen British--one having just\r\njoined--against twenty-four enemies; odds which, combined with the\r\nweather gage held by the French, should have insured them a decisive\r\nvictory. This result was prevented by the tentative action of De Grasse,\r\nencountering the tactical capacity and imperturbable self-possession of\r\nHood.\r\n\r\nRodney could not have bettered Hood's management, though he of course\r\nattributed to him the blame for results. It is evident, however, that\r\nfor various reasons the commander-in-chief should have been with the\r\nbody of his fleet. Even barring certain and timely information of the\r\nFrench coming, which Hood at least did not have, there was every\r\nreasonable probability that such an expedition would arrive at about the\r\nseason it did. Hood's insight, which was adequate to divining\r\npossibilities as well as to dealing with ascertained conditions, had\r\ntaught him that the latter half of April--and not sooner--was the time\r\nby which the British should be refitted, provisioned and watered full,\r\nand in all respects ready for prolonged operations against a powerful\r\nenemy; as well as concentrated to windward. He reasoned thus from the\r\nfact that the French navy, to the number of forty odd,--being the\r\ncombined fleets of D'Estaing from Brest and De Guichen from the West\r\nIndies,--had been assembled in Cadiz towards the end of 1780, and did\r\nnot return to Brest until January, 1781. To refit, sail, and reach\r\nMartinique again, would in his judgment postpone arrival to the middle\r\nof April, and this respite should be improved by getting the British\r\nships into the best campaigning condition, so as not to be hampered in\r\nsubsequent movements by necessities of repair and supply. With this\r\npersuasion he became eager, by the first of the month, for the admiral's\r\npresence; the more so because confident that, if he were on the spot, he\r\nwould see the necessity of changing position from leeward to windward.\r\n\"I begin to be extremely impatient for the honour of being and acting\r\nimmediately under your flag, as I do not find myself pleasant in being\r\nto leeward; for should an enemy's fleet attempt to get into Martinique,\r\nand the commander of it inclines to avoid battle, nothing but a skirmish\r\nwill probably happen, which in its consequences may operate as a defeat\r\nto the British squadron, though not a ship is lost and the enemy suffer\r\nmost.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a clear case in which events that actually befell were foreseen;\r\nnot by supernatural illumination, but by the clear light of unbiassed\r\nreason acting upon evident considerations. There _was_ but a skirmish,\r\nthe British _did_ suffer badly, and the consequences _were_ equivalent\r\nto defeat; for, had the whole British force of the line been present to\r\nwindward, it would have prevented the junction of the French, and\r\ntherefore have been so nearly equal to the main body as to have assured\r\nan action inflicting very serious injury, incapacitating the enemy for\r\nthe attacks upon Santa Lucia and Tobago, before which the latter fell,\r\nand not improbably deterring De Grasse from the expedition to the\r\nChesapeake which forced the capitulation of Cornwallis. Such deductions\r\nare of course dependent upon the contingencies inseparable from warfare.\r\nThey are not certainties, indeed; but they are inferences of very great\r\nprobability. So much hinged upon the presence of an officer with the\r\nfull discretion denied to Hood; of the officer primarily responsible for\r\nthe fleet, which was intrusted to him and not to another.\r\n\r\nProbable also is Hood's solution of Rodney's persistence in remaining at\r\nSt. Eustatius, and keeping the squadron under the command of his second\r\nto leeward of Martinique. He was possessed with the fancied paramount\r\nnecessity of protecting St. Eustatius against a sudden attack by the\r\nenemy, which he imagined might be supported by the small division in\r\nFort Royal; and the value of the booty shut his eyes to every other\r\nconsideration. As on the evening of the 12th of April, the great day of\r\nglory in his career, the captures already made assumed sufficiency in\r\nhis eyes, and co-operating with surmisings as to what the beaten and\r\nscattered French might do deterred him from further action; so now the\r\nprize already secured at St. Eustatius combined with the imaginative\r\n\"picture he made for himself\"--to use Napoleon's phrase--of its possible\r\ndangers, to blind him to the really decisive needs of the situation. It\r\nis clear, however, that local naval provision for the safety of a petty\r\nisland was in point of difficulty, as of consequence, a secondary\r\nmatter, within the competence of many of his captains; and that the\r\nprimary factor, on which all depended, was the control of the sea, by\r\nthe British fleet predominating over the enemy's. Consequently the\r\ncommander-in-chief should have been where his second was, at the centre\r\nof decisive action, where an enemy's fleet was to be expected.\r\n\r\nThis was the more incumbent because Rodney himself, writing to Admiral\r\nParker in Jamaica on April 16th, said, \"As the enemy hourly expect a\r\ngreat fleet in these seas, I have scarcely a sufficient number of\r\nline-of-battle-ships to blockade the island of Martinique, or to engage\r\nthe enemy's fleet should they appear, if their number should be so large\r\nas reported,\"--twenty-four. This report came from French sources, and it\r\nwill be noted, from the date of his letter, was in his possession\r\ntwelve days before the enemy arrived. It was both specific and\r\nantecedently probable, and should have determined the admiral's action.\r\nWhether he had similar news from home does not appear. Sandwich writing\r\nhim on March 21st, the day before the French left Brest, professed\r\nignorance of their destination, but added, \"the most prevailing and most\r\nprobable opinion is that they are to go to the West India Islands, and\r\nafterwards to North America.\" Their number he estimated at twenty-five,\r\nwhich tallied with Rodney's intelligence of twenty-four. The latter was\r\nexact, save that four were armed _en flûte_; that is, as transports,\r\nwith their guns below, to be subsequently mounted. Despite everything,\r\nthe admiral remained at St. Eustatius until May 4th, when the arrival of\r\na crippled ship from Hood brought him the news of the skirmish. He was\r\nattending, doubtless, to details pertaining to his command, but he was\r\nchiefly occupied with the disposition of the property seized on the\r\nisland; a matter which he afterwards found to his cost would have been\r\nmuch better committed to administrators skilled in the law. \"Had they\r\nabided by the first plan settled before I left them,\" wrote Hood, \"and\r\nnot have interfered, but have left the management to the land and sea\r\nfolk appointed for that purpose, all would have gone smooth and easy.\"\r\n\r\nHowever this might have proved, the immediate supervision of the island\r\nand its spoils was no business for a commander-in-chief in active war\r\ntime; particularly when it entailed leaving the charge of his main\r\nfleet, at a critical moment, to a junior admiral of very recent\r\nappointment, and still unproved. It was not the separate importance of\r\nthe position intrusted to Hood that made it peculiarly the station for\r\nthe commander-in-chief. It might have been intrinsically as important,\r\nyet relatively secondary; but actually it was the centre and key upon\r\nwhich, and upon which alone, the campaign could turn and did turn.\r\nNeither was the question one of the relative merits, as yet unknown, of\r\nRodney and Hood. A commander-in-chief cannot devolve his own proper\r\nfunctions upon a subordinate, however able, without graver cause than\r\ncan be shown in this instance. The infatuation which detained Rodney at\r\na side issue can only be excused--not justified--by a temporary\r\ninability to see things in their true proportion, induced on more than\r\none occasion by a temperamental defect,--the lack of the single eye to\r\nmilitary considerations,--which could find contentment in partial\r\nsuccess, and be indifferent to further results to be secured by\r\nsustained action.\r\n\r\nThere is a saying, apt to prove true, that war does not forgive. For his\r\ninitial error Rodney himself, and the British campaign in general, paid\r\nheavily throughout the year 1781. The French fleet in undiminished vigor\r\nlay a dead weight upon all his subsequent action, which, like the\r\ndispositions prior to its arrival, underwent the continued censure of\r\nHood; acrid, yet not undiscriminating nor misplaced. As already\r\nobserved, the surrender of Cornwallis can with probability be ascribed\r\nto this loss of an opportunity afforded to strike a blow at the outset,\r\nwhen the enemy was as yet divided, embarrassed with convoy, raw in\r\norganization and drill, in all which it could not but improve as the\r\nmonths passed. The results began at once to be apparent, and\r\nembarrassments accumulated with time. Hood's ships, though no one was\r\nwholly disabled, had suffered very considerably; and, while\r\nindispensable repairs could temporarily be made, efficiency was\r\naffected. They needed, besides, immediate water and supplies, as Rodney\r\nhimself stated--a want which Hood would have anticipated. To increase\r\ndifficulty, the French mounted the batteries of the vessels _en flûte_,\r\nand so raised their total nominal force to twenty-eight. Hood was unable\r\nto regain Santa Lucia, because his crippled ships could not beat against\r\nthe current. He therefore left it to itself, and bore away to the\r\nnorthward, where he joined Rodney on May 11th, between St. Kitts and\r\nAntigua. The campaign of 1781, destined to be wholly defensive for the\r\nBritish, opened under these odds, the responsibility for which lies in\r\nconsiderable measure on Rodney.\r\n\r\nAfter the junction, the British fleet went to Barbados, where it arrived\r\nMay 18th. Meantime, the French had proceeded in force against Santa\r\nLucia, landing a considerable body of troops, and investing the island\r\nwith twenty-five sail-of-the-line, two of which with 1300 soldiers went\r\non to attempt the British Tobago. The attack on Santa Lucia failed, and\r\nthe French returned to Martinique; but learning there that Rodney was at\r\nsea, heading southward, De Grasse became alarmed for his detachment at\r\nTobago, and moved to its support with his entire fleet. Rodney, knowing\r\nof the detachment only, sent against it six ships under Rear Admiral\r\nDrake; a half-measure severely censured by Hood, whose comments\r\nthroughout indicate either a much superior natural sagacity, or else the\r\nclearer insight of a man whose eye dwells steadfastly on the military\r\nsituation, untroubled by conflicting claims. \"What a wonderful happy\r\nturn would have been given to the King's affairs in this country had Sir\r\nGeorge Rodney gone with his whole force to Tobago as soon as he might,\r\nand in my humble opinion ought to have done. Nay, had he even gone when\r\nMr. Drake did, the island would have been saved. I laboured much to\r\neffect it, but all in vain, and fully stated my reasons in writing as\r\nsoon as the intelligence came. Every ship there with all the troops must\r\nhave fallen into our hands two days before De Grasse got there with his\r\ntwenty-one sail;\" to which Rodney, in full strength, would again have\r\nopposed twenty. \"_Now_ the enemy may do as they will;\" for they were\r\nunited in Martinique, twenty-eight to twenty. In short, Rodney saw at\r\nTobago only the one French detachment; Hood saw therein the definition\r\nof the enemy's purpose, the necessity laid on them to fly to the aid of\r\ntheir exposed division, and the chance to anticipate them,--to gain an\r\nadvantage first, and to beat them afterwards.\r\n\r\nRodney's tentative and inadequate action was not improbably induced\r\npartly by the \"extreme want of water,\" which he reported in his\r\ndespatches; and this again was due to failure to prepare adequately\r\nduring the period of respite foreseen by Hood, but unnoted by his own\r\npreoccupied mind. The result is instructive. Drake fell in with the main\r\nbody of the French, and of course had to retire,--fortunate in regaining\r\nhis commander-in-chief unmolested. De Grasse's movement had become known\r\nin Barbados, and as soon as Drake appeared Rodney sailed with the fleet,\r\nbut upon arriving off Tobago, on June 5th, learned that it had\r\nsurrendered on the 2d. Its fall he duly attributed to local neglect and\r\ncowardice; but evidently the presence of the British fleet might have\r\nhad some effect. He then returned to Barbados, and during the passage\r\nthe hostile fleets sighted each other on the 9th,--twenty British to\r\ntwenty-three French; but Rodney was unwilling to engage lest he might be\r\nentangled with the foul ground about Grenada. As that island was then in\r\nthe enemy's hands, he could get no anchorage there, and so might be\r\ndriven to leeward of his opponent, exposing Barbados. It is perhaps\r\nneedless to point out that had he been to windward of Martinique when De\r\nGrasse first arrived, as Hood wished, he would have been twenty to\r\ntwenty, with clear ground, and the antagonist embarrassed with convoy.\r\nHis present perplexities, in their successive phases, can be seen\r\nthroughout to be the result of sticking to St. Eustatius, not only\r\nphysically, but mentally.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was with what followed. On reaching Barbados again, he had to\r\nreport that the French were back in Martinique, and now twenty-eight\r\nthrough the arming of the ships _en flûte_. Despite their superiority,\r\n\"they do not venture to move,\" he said somewhat sneeringly, and\r\ndoubtless his \"fleet in being\" had an effect on them; but they were also\r\nintent on a really great operation. On July 5th, De Grasse sailed for\r\nCap François in Hayti, there to organize a visit to the continent in\r\nsupport of Washington's operations. Rodney, pursuant to his sagacious\r\nplan of the previous years, sent also a detachment of fourteen ships\r\nunder Hood, which he endeavored, but unsuccessfully, to have increased\r\nby some from Jamaica. That De Grasse would take his whole fleet to North\r\nAmerica, leaving none in the West Indies, nor sending any to Europe, was\r\na step that neither Rodney nor Hood foresaw. The miscalculation cannot\r\nbe imputed to either as an error at this time. It was simply one of the\r\ndeceptions to which the defensive is ever liable; but it is fairly\r\nchargeable to the original fault whereby the French admiral was enabled\r\nto enter Fort Royal uninjured in the previous April. From the time his\r\nfleet was concentrated, the British had to accept the defensive with its\r\nembarrassments.\r\n\r\nRodney had contemplated going in person with his ships, which Sandwich\r\nalso had urged upon him; but his health was seriously impaired, and the\r\nnecessity for a surgical operation combined to induce his return to\r\nEngland. The final decision on this point he postponed to the last\r\nmoment of the homeward voyage, keeping a frigate in company in which to\r\ngo to New York, if able; but ultimately he felt compelled to give up.\r\nThis conclusion settled Cornwallis's fate, antecedently but finally.\r\nThat year Great Britain fell between two stools. In view of De Grasse's\r\nknown expressions, it may be affirmed with great confidence that he\r\nwould have seen reason to abandon the Chesapeake, leaving open the sea\r\nroad for Cornwallis to escape, had either Rodney or Hood commanded the\r\nBritish fleet there in the battle of September 5th; but Rodney was away,\r\nand Hood second only to an incompetent superior.\r\n\r\nRodney landed in England, September 19th, and was again afloat by\r\nDecember 12th, although he did not finally sail for his station until\r\nthe middle of January, 1782. This brief period was one of the deepest\r\nmilitary depression; for during it occurred Cornwallis's surrender,\r\nOctober 19th, under conditions of evident British inferiority, on sea\r\nand shore alike, which enforced the conviction that the colonies must be\r\ngranted their independence. Not only so, but the known extensive\r\npreparations of the Bourbon courts pointed to grave danger also for the\r\nCaribbean colonies, the sugar and import trade of which counted largely\r\nin the financial resources of the empire. Amid the general gloom Rodney\r\nhad his own special vexation; for, before he left, news was received of\r\nthe recapture of St. Eustatius by a small French expedition, prior to\r\nthe return of Hood to the West Indies from the unfortunate operations on\r\nthe continent. As in the case of Tobago, Rodney severely blamed the\r\nlocal defence, and very possibly justly; but attention should not wander\r\nfrom the effect that must have been produced upon all subsequent\r\nconditions by preparation and action on the part of the British fleet,\r\nin the spring of 1781, on the lines then favored by Hood.\r\n\r\nShortly before he had sailed for home, Rodney had written his wife, \"In\r\nall probability, the enemy, when they leave these seas, will go to\r\nAmerica. Wherever they go, I will watch their motions, and certainly\r\nattack them if they give me a proper opportunity. The fate of England\r\nmay depend upon the event.\" The last sentence was in measure a prophecy,\r\nso far, that is, as decisive of the original issue at stake,--the\r\nsubjugation or independence of the United Colonies; but, without further\r\nlaboring the point unduly, it may be permitted here to sum up what has\r\nbeen said, with the remark that in the summer of 1781 control of events\r\nhad passed out of Rodney's hands. From the time of the original fault,\r\nin suffering the French to meet Hood to leeward of Martinique, with an\r\ninferior force, more and more did it become impossible to him to assure\r\nconditions sufficiently favorable. With the highest personal courage, he\r\ndid not have eminent professional daring; nor, with considerable\r\ntactical acquirement, was he gifted with that illuminative originality\r\nwhich characterized Hood and Nelson. He therefore needed either a\r\nreasonable probability of success, or the spur of imminent emergency, to\r\nelicit the kind of action needed to save the British cause. The chances\r\nto windward of Martinique would have been ninety out of a hundred; from\r\nthat time forward they diminished with continually increasing rapidity.\r\nWith such a situation he was not the man to cope.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Barbados, February 19, 1782, Rodney learned that the\r\ngarrison of St. Kitts was besieged in Brimstone Hill, and the island\r\nitself beleaguered by the French fleet, thirty-three of-the-line, which\r\nSir Samuel Hood, with two thirds their number, had so far held in check\r\nby a series of manoeuvres unusually acute in conception and brilliant\r\nin execution. Proceeding immediately to Antigua, he there heard on the\r\n23d that St. Kitts had capitulated on the 13th. Two days later he was\r\njoined by Hood, and then took the united fleet to Santa Lucia, where he\r\nwas on March 5th. The knowledge of a large supply fleet expected for the\r\nFrench, and essential to the known project of the allies against\r\nJamaica, carried the British fleet again to sea; but it failed to\r\nintercept the convoy, and returned once more to Santa Lucia, where it\r\nanchored in Gros Ilet Bay, thirty miles from Fort Royal, where the\r\nFrench were lying. Various changes made the respective numbers, when\r\noperations opened, British thirty-six of-the-line, French thirty-five,\r\nwith two fifty-gun ships; a near approach to equality.\r\n\r\nRodney's faculties were now all alert. He had had some needed repose,\r\nand he was again under the stimulus of reputation to restore; for it\r\nwould have been vain to assert, even to himself, that he was entirely\r\nclear, not merely of error, to which the most careful is liable, but of\r\nserious fault in the previous year. Moreover, he had been sharply\r\nassailed in Parliament for the transactions at St. Eustatius on the\r\ncivil side, distinct from his military conduct. To such ills there is no\r\nplaster so healing as a victory; and the occasion about to arise proved,\r\nin its successive stages,--until the last,--admirably adapted to his\r\nnatural and acquired qualifications. First, a series of manoeuvres\r\nprotracted over three or four days; and afterwards a hard fought battle,\r\nconverted by a happy yet by no means unusual accident into a decided and\r\nshowy success. Decided, but not decisive; for, like the soldier\r\ndesperate in deed before rewarded, but who, when summoned again, advised\r\nthat the chance be given to a man who had not a purse of gold, Rodney\r\npreferred to pause on that personally safe side of moderation in\r\nachievement which is rarely conducive to finality, and is nowhere so\r\nill-placed as in the aims of a commander-in-chief. The true prudence of\r\nwar,--as it is also its mercy, to friend and to foe,--is to strike\r\nwithout cessation or slackness till power of future action is crushed.\r\n\r\nDe Grasse's immediate task was to protect a large convoy from Martinique\r\nto Cap François (now Cap Haytien), in Hayti, a distance of about a\r\nthousand miles. Cumbered with merchant vessels, and aware that Rodney\r\nwould be at once on his track, he could not go straight across the\r\nCaribbean; the British fleet, not so hampered, would be sure to overtake\r\nand destroy. He purposed, therefore, to skirt the Antilles, keeping\r\ncontinually in reach of a port of refuge. Rodney, knowing the aim to be\r\nJamaica, had little doubt of overtaking in any case, if started\r\npromptly. He therefore kept himself in signal touch of Fort Royal by a\r\nchain of frigates, extending from its offing to his own anchorage.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of April the French sailed. The British followed instantly,\r\nand before sundown had them in sight, not only by lookout vessels, but\r\nfrom the mastheads of the main fleet. At daybreak next morning they were\r\nvisible from the decks of the British van; a very marked gain. De Grasse\r\nsaw that at that rate, unless he got rid of the convoy, he would\r\ncertainly be overtaken, which it was his aim to elude in pursuance of\r\nthe usual French policy of ulterior purposes; so, being then north of\r\nDominica, he sent the merchant vessels into Guadaloupe, and undertook to\r\ncarry the ships-of-war through the passage between the two islands,\r\nbeating to windward. This would draw the British away from the convoy,\r\nunless they were content to let the fleet go, which was not to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nBetween 8 A.M. and 2 P.M. of April 9th, several sharp skirmishes took\r\nplace between the French and the British van, under Hood.[9] De Grasse\r\nhad here an opportunity of crushing a fraction of the enemy, but failed\r\nto use it, thus insuring his own final discomfiture. Rodney, who was\r\nbecalmed with the centre and rear of his command, could do nothing but\r\npush forward reinforcements to Hood as the wind served; and this he did.\r\nPursuit was maintained tenaciously during the following night and the\r\nnext two days,--April 10th and 11th; but in sustained chases of bodies\r\nof ships, the chased continually drops units, which must be forsaken or\r\nelse the retreat of the whole must be retarded. So in this case, certain\r\nof De Grasse's ships were either so leewardly or so ill handled that the\r\nbulk of the fleet, which had gained considerably to windward, had to\r\nbear down to them, thus losing the ground won. Under such circumstances\r\nthe chapter of accidents--or of incidents--frequently introduces great\r\nresults; and so it proved here.\r\n\r\nAt 2 A.M. of April 12th, De Grasse's flag-ship, the _Ville de Paris_,\r\nand the seventy-four-gun ship _Zélé_, crossing on opposite tacks, came\r\ninto collision. The former received little damage, but the _Zélé_ lost\r\nher foremast and bowsprit. De Grasse then ordered her into Guadaloupe,\r\nin tow of a frigate. When day broke, about five o'clock, these two were\r\nonly about six miles from the British rear, under Hood, whose division\r\nhad been shifted from the van in consequence of injuries received on the\r\n9th. The British column was then standing east-northeast, closehauled on\r\nthe starboard tack, the crippled vessel under its lee, but the French of\r\nthe main body well to windward. To draw them within reach, Rodney\r\nsignalled Hood to send chasers after the _Zélé_. De Grasse took the bait\r\nand ran down to her support, ordering his ships to form line-of-battle\r\non the port tack, which was done hastily and tumultuously. The two lines\r\non which the antagonists were respectively advancing now pointed to a\r\ncommon and not distant point of intersection, which the French, despite\r\nthe loss of ground already undergone, reached first, passing in front\r\nand to windward of the head of the British column. Eight ships thus went\r\nby clear, but the ninth arrived at the same moment with the leading\r\nBritish vessel, which put her helm up and ran along close to leeward of\r\nthe French line towards its rear, followed in so doing by the rest of\r\nher fleet.\r\n\r\nThe battle thus assumed the phase of two fleets passing each other in\r\nopposite directions, on parallel lines; a condition usually unproductive\r\nof results, and amounting to little more than a brush, as had been the\r\ncase in two rencounters between Rodney and De Guichen in the prolonged\r\nchase of May, 1780. Chance permitted a different issue on this occasion.\r\nThe wind at the moment of first collision, shortly before 8 A.M., was\r\neast, and so continued till five minutes past nine, when it shifted\r\nsuddenly to the southeastward, ahead for the French, abaft for the\r\nBritish. The former, being already close to the wind, could keep their\r\nsails full only by bearing away, which broke up their line ahead, the\r\norder of battle as ranged for mutual support; while the British being\r\nable to luff could stand into the enemy's line. Rodney's flag-ship, the\r\n_Formidable_, 90, was just drawing up with the _Glorieux_, 74, nineteenth\r\nfrom the van in the French order and fourth astern of the _Ville de\r\nParis_, De Grasse's flag-ship. Luffing to the new wind, she passed\r\nthrough the French line at this point, followed by the five ships astern\r\nof her; while the sixth astern, the _Bedford_, 74, luffing on her own\r\naccount, broke also through the French astern of the _César_ and the\r\n_Hector_, 74's, eleventh and twelfth in their order. The twelve British\r\nvessels in rear of the _Bedford_ followed in her wake. Hood was in one\r\nof these, the _Barfleur_, 90. Of the ships ahead of Rodney the nearest\r\none imitated his example instantly and went through the line; the\r\nremainder, sixteen in all, continued northward for a space.\r\n\r\nThese sudden and unexpected movements overpowered the _César_, _Hector_,\r\nand _Glorieux_ under a weight of successive broadsides that completely\r\ncrushed them, separated De Grasse with six companion vessels from his\r\nvan and his rear, and placed the British main body to windward of the\r\nFrench. Both sides were disordered, but the French were not only\r\ndisordered but severed, into three formless groups, not to be united\r\nexcept by a good breeze and exceeding good management, neither of which\r\nwas forthcoming. Even to frame a plan operative under such conditions\r\nrequires in an admiral accuracy of judgment and readiness rarely\r\nbestowed; but to communicate his designs and enforce execution upon\r\ncaptains under such a staggering shock of disaster is even more uncommon\r\nof accomplishment. During the remainder of the day light airs from the\r\neastward prevailed, interspersed with frequent calms; conditions\r\nunfavorable to movement of any kind, but far more to the French,\r\ndeprived of concert of purpose, than to the British, whose general\r\ncourse was sufficiently defined by the confusion of the enemy, and the\r\naccident of a small group surrounding their commander-in-chief, to\r\ncapture whom was always a recognized principal object. The very\r\nfeebleness of the breeze favored them by comparison; for they had but to\r\ngo before it with all their light sails, while their opponents, in order\r\nto join, were constrained to lateral movement, which did not allow the\r\nsame canvas.\r\n\r\nThere was, in short, during the rest of the day an unusual opportunity\r\nfor success, on such a scale as should be not only brilliant, but really\r\ndecisive of the future course of the war; opportunity to inflict a\r\nmaritime blow from which the enemy could not recover. Does it need to\r\nsay clearly that here the choice was between a personal triumph, already\r\nsecured for the successful admiral, and the general security of the\r\nnation by the \"annihilation\"--the word is Nelson's--of the enemy? That\r\nRodney thus phrased the alternative to himself is indeed most unlikely;\r\nbut that he failed to act efficiently, to rise to an emergency, for the\r\npossible occurrence of which he had had ample time as well as warning to\r\nprepare, is but too certain. Even after the British had got to windward\r\nof the enemy and seen their disorder, although the signal for the line\r\nwas hauled down, none was made for a general chase. That for close\r\naction, hoisted at 1 P.M., was discontinued thirty minutes later, when\r\nfive full hours of daylight remained. Even in example the admiral was\r\nslack, by Hood's account. \"He pursued only under topsails (sometimes his\r\nforesail set, and at other times his mizzen topsail aback) the greatest\r\npart of the afternoon, though the flying enemy had all the sail set\r\ntheir very shattered state would allow.\" Hood, curbed by his superior's\r\nimmediate presence, did what he could by putting all sail on the\r\n_Barfleur_, and signalling the various ships of his personal command to\r\ndo the same; \"not one but chased in the afternoon with studding sails\r\nbelow and aloft.\" It was bare poetic justice, therefore, that the _Ville\r\nde Paris_, the great prize of the day, though surrounded by numerous\r\nfoes, struck formally to him.\r\n\r\nThe _Hector_, _César_, and _Glorieux_, already paralyzed ere the chase\r\nbegan, were the only results of this languid movement, except the French\r\nflag-ship and the _Ardent_, 64. The latter was taken because,\r\nnotwithstanding her being an indifferent sailer, she gallantly tried to\r\npass from her own division, the van, to support her commander-in-chief\r\nin his extremity. It was 6.29 P.M. when the _Ville de Paris_ struck;\r\nsixteen minutes later, 6.45, Rodney made signal to bring-to for the\r\nnight--to give over pursuit. Only the _Ville de Paris_ and the _Ardent_\r\ncan be considered to have been secured by following, after the battle\r\nproper closed.\r\n\r\nNor was any other attempt made to profit by the victory. On the 13th the\r\nfleet began to move very slowly towards Jamaica, the local protection of\r\nwhich had become imperative through the failure to annihilate the enemy,\r\nwho must now go to leeward--to Hayti; but after four hours Rodney\r\nbrought-to again, and on the 16th, according to Hood, was in \"the exact\r\nsame spot off Guadaloupe. It has indeed been calm some part of the time,\r\nbut we might have been more than twenty leagues farther to the\r\nwestward.\" The _César_ having been accidentally burned on the night of\r\nthe battle, the prizes _Hector_ and _Glorieux_ were sent ahead in charge\r\nof three ships-of-the-line. This was a questionable disposition, as they\r\nwere advancing in the direction of the enemy, without being covered by\r\nthe interposition of the main fleet. The _Ville de Paris_ Rodney kept\r\nclose by his own side, unable to tear himself from her; so at least said\r\nHood, who \"would to God she had sunk the moment she had yielded to the\r\narms of His Majesty,\" for \"we would then have had a dozen better ships\r\nin lieu of her.\" Rodney was so tickled with her that he \"can talk of\r\nnothing else, and says he will hoist his flag on board of her.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 17th Hood, having vainly urged his commander to improve the\r\nsituation by more energetic action, represented to him that the small\r\ndetachment convoying the _Hector_ and _Glorieux_ might fall in with a\r\nsuperior enemy, if not supported. Rodney then directed him to go ahead\r\nwith ten ships until as far as Altavela, midway on the south side of\r\nSanto Domingo, where he was to await the main body. Hood gave a wide\r\nconstruction to these orders, and pushed for the Mona Passage, between\r\nSanto Domingo and Porto Rico, where on the 19th he intercepted two\r\nsixty-four gun ships, and two smaller cruisers. In reporting this\r\nincident to Rodney, he added, \"It is a very mortifying circumstance to\r\nrelate to you, Sir, that the French fleet which you put to flight on the\r\n12th went through the Mona Channel on the 18th, only the day before I\r\nwas in it.\" That sustained vigorous chase could not have been fruitless\r\nis further shown by the fact that Rodney himself, deliberately as he\r\nmoved, apparently lying-to each night of the first half-dozen succeeding\r\nthe battle, reached Jamaica three days only after the main body of the\r\ndefeated French gained Cap François, though they had every motive to\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nOf the reasons for such lethargic action, wholly inconsistent with true\r\nmilitary principle, and bitterly criticised by Hood,--who affirmed that\r\ntwenty ships might have been taken,--Rodney drew up an express account,\r\nwhich cannot be considered as adequate to his justification. In this he\r\nargued that, if he had pursued, the enemy, who \"went off in a close\r\nconnected body, might have defeated by rotation the ships that had come\r\nup with them, and thereby exposed the British fleet, after a victory, to\r\na defeat.\" \"They went off in a body of twenty-six ships-of-the-line, and\r\nmight, by ordering two or three of their best-sailing ships or frigates\r\nto have shown lights at times, and by changing their course, have\r\ninduced the British fleet to have followed them, while the main of their\r\nfleet, by hiding their lights, might have hauled their wind, have been\r\nfar to windward before daylight, and intercepted the captured ships, and\r\nthe most crippled ships of the English;\" and he even conceived that, as\r\nthe main body of the British would at the same time have gone far to\r\nleeward, the French, regaining their own ports in Guadaloupe and\r\nMartinique, might have taken Antigua, Barbados, and Santa Lucia.\r\n\r\nThe principal impression produced by this formal summary of reasons is\r\nthat of unwisdom after the event, and that it was elicited by the\r\nremonstrances of Hood to himself, which are known to have voiced\r\ndiscontent prevalent in the fleet, and rendered some ready reply\r\nexpedient. The substance of them, when analyzed, is that war must be\r\nrendered effective by not running risks, and that calculation to that\r\neffect is to be made by attributing every chance and advantage to the\r\nenemy, and none to one's self. Further, no account is to be taken of\r\nthat most notable factor, ultimate risk,--as distinguished from present\r\nrisk. This phantasm, of the sudden assumption of the offensive by a\r\nbeaten and disordered fleet, which, through the capture of its chief,\r\nhad changed commanders at nightfall, is as purely and mischievously\r\nimaginative as the fiction, upon which it rests, of the close connected\r\nbody. Instead of being close-connected, the French were scattered\r\nhopelessly, utterly disabled for immediate, or even proximate,\r\nresistance to a well sustained chase and attack. During the next\r\ntwenty-four hours their new admiral had with him but ten ships; and only\r\nfive joined in the following twelve days, to April 25th, when he reached\r\nCap François, where four more were found. Six others had strayed to\r\nCuraçao, six hundred miles distant, whence they did not rejoin the flag\r\nuntil May. Neither in Rodney's surmises, nor in the actual facts of the\r\ncase, is to be found any reasonable excuse for failure to observe the\r\nevident military duty of keeping touch with the enemy during the dark\r\nhours,--\"pursue under easy sail,\" to use Hood's words, \"so as never to\r\nhave lost sight of the enemy in the night,\"--with a view to resume the\r\nengagement next day, at farthest. This, and to regain to windward, were\r\nas feasible to the victor as to the vanquished.\r\n\r\nA truer explanation of this grave negligence is to be found in Rodney's\r\nmore casual words recorded by Hood. \"I lamented to Sir George on the\r\ntwelfth that the signal for a general chase was not made when that for\r\nthe line was hauled down, and that he did not continue to pursue so as\r\nto keep sight of the enemy all night; to which he only answered, 'Come,\r\nwe have done very handsomely as it is.' I could therefore say no more\r\nupon the subject.\" He did, however, resume the subject with Sir Charles\r\nDouglas, the chief of staff. Douglas was of the same opinion as Hood,\r\nand for making the suggestion at the proper moment had been snubbed by\r\nRodney, who had established over him a domination of manner which\r\nprecluded proper insistence, or even due representation, such as became\r\nhis office. \"His answer was, 'Sir George chose to pursue in a body;'\"\r\nthat is, in regular order, not by general chase. \"'Why, Sir Charles,' I\r\nreplied, 'if that was Sir George's wish, could it have been more\r\neffectually complied with than by the signal for a general chase, with\r\n_proper attention_? Because, if a ship is too wide on the starboard\r\nwing, you have a signal to make her steer more to port. If a ship is too\r\nwide on the larboard wing, you have a signal to make her steer more to\r\nstarboard. If a ship is too far ahead, you can by signal make her\r\nshorten sail,'\" etc. This by daylight; while, \"'if Sir George was\r\nunwilling his ships should engage in the night, there is a signal to\r\ncall every ship in, and, that followed by the one for the form of\r\nsailing, the fleet might have gone on in sight of the enemy all night in\r\nthe most compact and safe order for completing the business most\r\ngloriously the next day.' Sir Charles walked off without saying another\r\nword.\" There was in fact nothing to say. Hood's methods were not only\r\ncorrect, but in no respect novel. Every capable officer was familiar\r\nwith them before, as well as after the battle. The trouble was that\r\nRodney was content with a present clear success, and averse from further\r\nrisk. He had reached his limitations. It is known now that Douglas\r\nagreed with Hood, but he was too loyal to his chief to say so publicly,\r\nthen or afterwards; and especially, doubtless, to so irritable a talker.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of Rodney's professional character the events of April\r\n8th to 12th are therefore unfavorable rather than the reverse.\r\nConcerning his stronger qualities their evidence is simply cumulative;\r\nthe new light thrown reveals defects, not unsuspected excellencies. The\r\nreadiness in which his fleet was held at Santa Lucia, the promptness\r\nwith which he followed, the general conduct of the chase as far as\r\nappears, though doubtless open to criticism in detail as in the ever\r\ncensorious remarks of Hood,--all these show the same alert,\r\naccomplished, and diligent officer, resolute to the utmost of his\r\nnatural and acquired faculties. It is the same after the battle joins,\r\nso long as its progress does not transcend his accepted ideas,--which\r\nwere much in advance of the great mass of his contemporaries,--though\r\nunder the conditions he saw no chance to apply the particular methods\r\nfamiliar to his thought.\r\n\r\nBut when sudden opportunity offered, of a kind he had not anticipated,\r\nhe is found unequal to it. Neither natural temper, nor acquired habit of\r\nmind, respond to the call. To pass through the French line, when the\r\nwind shifted, was an instigation too sudden and a risk too great for his\r\nown initiative. The balance of evidence shows that it was due to the\r\nsuggestion, and even more to the pressure, of Sir Charles Douglas.\r\nCarried beyond his habitual submission by the impulse of a great\r\nthought, and unburdened by the ultimate responsibility which must remain\r\nwith the admiral, the Captain of the Fleet not only urged luffing\r\nthrough the enemy's line, but--so the story runs--in the excitement of\r\nthe moment, and seeing the chance slipping past, even under the then\r\nsluggish breeze, he ordered the helm down. The admiral, thus faced,\r\ncountermanded the order. A moment of silence followed, during which the\r\ntwo men stepped apart, the admiral even entering the cabin, which would\r\nbe but a few paces from the wheel. Returning, he permitted Douglas to\r\nhave his way; an act which, whether done courteously or grudgingly, does\r\nnot bespeak professional conviction, but the simple acceptance of\r\nanother's will in place of one's own indecision.\r\n\r\nThe incident is in entire keeping with the picture of Rodney's\r\nirresolution, and consequent uncertain course, drawn in successive\r\ntouches by Hood in the hours and days succeeding the victory. Events\r\nhad called him to deeds beyond his limitations. Age of course counted\r\nfor much; fatigue, after three days of doubtful chase and one of\r\nprolonged battle, for more; but it may here be recalled that an older\r\nman, after a more wearisome and doubtful exposure, willed of his own\r\nmotion to do what Rodney left undone. Sir Byam Martin has recorded,[10]\r\n\"After the battle of the 1st of June, Lord Howe was quite exhausted, as\r\nwell indeed he might, considering that they had been manoeuvring and\r\nfighting for three days. Although feeble in body, and so exhausted as to\r\nbe obliged to sit down in a chair on deck, he expressed a wish to pursue\r\nthe flying enemy; but Sir Roger Curtis, the Captain of the Fleet (Chief\r\nof Staff, as Douglas to Rodney) said, 'I vow to God, my lord, if you do\r\nthey will turn the tables upon us.' This anecdote I had from the late\r\nAdmiral Bowen, who was master of the _Queen Charlotte_ and a party to\r\nthe conversation.\" Under circumstances approaching similarity,--so far\r\nas North Atlantic fogs and weather resemble West India climate,--Howe\r\nwas sixty-eight, Rodney sixty-three, at the moment of testing. The one\r\nlost the support of the man--Curtis--upon whom he must chiefly rely for\r\nobservation and execution; the other was urged in vain by the officer\r\nwho held the same relation to him. Nelson once spoke slightingly of \"a\r\nLord Howe's victory, take a part, and retire into port;\" as a trait of\r\nofficial character, however, Howe's purpose was far in advance of\r\nRodney's, as this was viewed by Nelson's ideal admiral, Hood. It is now\r\nknown, by a letter of Nelson's very recently published, that he held the\r\nsame opinion of Rodney's remissness in this instance, although he\r\ncordially recognized the general obligation of the country and the navy\r\nto that eminent seaman. Writing in 1804 to his intimate friend\r\nCornwallis, one of Rodney's captains, he used these words: \"On the score\r\nof fighting, I believe, my dear friend, that you have had your full\r\nshare, and in obtaining the greatest victory, _if it had been followed\r\nup_, that our country ever saw.\"[11] It was a clear case of spirit being\r\nbrought into subjection to form.\r\n\r\nRodney's professional career may be reckoned to have ended with his\r\narrival at Jamaica on the 29th of April. The change of ministry\r\nconsequent upon Cornwallis's surrender brought into power his political\r\nopponents, and in May the new Admiralty superseded him. News of the\r\nvictory reached England just too late to permit them to revoke the\r\norder; his successor, Admiral Pigot, having already sailed. On the 22d\r\nof July Rodney left Jamaica, and on the 15th of September landed at\r\nBristol. Although not so intended, his recall may be considered in line\r\nwith his proverbial good fortune. He left his successor to grapple with\r\ndifficulties, and with numbers, the continued existence of which was due\r\nchiefly to his own neglect after April 12th, and by the burden of which\r\nthe conditions of peace were influenced adversely to Great Britain. To\r\nquote again Hood's apt comment, \"Had Sir George Rodney's judgment, after\r\nthe enemy had been so totally put to flight, bore any proportion to the\r\nhigh courage, zeal and exertion, shown by every captain, officer, and\r\nman under his command in battle, _all_ difficulty would now have been at\r\nan end. We might have done just as we pleased, instead of being at this\r\nhour (April 30th) upon the defensive.\" This is ultimate risk, which is\r\nentailed by exaggerated concern for immediate apparent security, and\r\nends in sapping endurance.\r\n\r\nThe auspicious moment at which the news of the battle reached England,\r\nand the surface brilliancy of the achievement,--especially the capture\r\nof the enemy's commander-in-chief,--diverted attention from any\r\nexamination of possible shortcomings. Rodney received a vote of thanks\r\nfrom Parliament, and was advanced to the peerage by the King. A pension\r\nof £2,000 per annum was also voted, additional doubtless to a similar\r\nsum granted after his destruction of Langara's squadron and relief of\r\nGibraltar. Other rewards and recognition had already attended his naval\r\ncareer. He had been made a baronet in 1764, at the expiration of his\r\nfirst tenure of the Leeward Islands Station; in 1780 the order of the\r\nBath was bestowed upon him,--the distinction being enhanced by not\r\nawaiting a vacancy, but making him a supernumerary member,--and in 1781,\r\nupon the death of Lord Hawke, he became Vice-Admiral of Great Britain,\r\nthe highest professional honor in the service.\r\n\r\nAfter his return to England Rodney lived generally in retirement. His\r\nlatter years were harassed by law suits, growing chiefly out of his\r\nproceedings at St. Eustatius, and the attendant expenses kept him poor.\r\nHe died in May, 1792, at the age of seventy-three.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Life of Lord Hawke, by Captain Montagu Burrows, Royal Navy, p. 194.\r\n\r\n[7] For account and analysis of Byng's action, see _ante_, pp. 47-67.\r\n\r\n[8] The italics are the author's.\r\n\r\n[9] The writer does not purpose to give an account of these actions,\r\nexcept so far as Rodney himself is concerned.

The elder\r\nbrother of the subject of this sketch, during the few short months in\r\nwhich he was brought into close contact with the colonists of 1758,\r\nbefore the unlucky campaign of Ticonderoga, won from them not merely the\r\ntrust inspired by his soldierly qualities and his genius for war,--the\r\ngenius of sound common sense and solidity of character,--but got a deep\r\nhold upon their affections by the consideration and respect shown to\r\nthem by him, traits to which they had been too little accustomed in the\r\nBritish officers of that day. Nor was this attitude on his part only a\r\nsuperficial disguise assumed by policy to secure a needed support. The\r\nshrewd, suspicious provincials would soon have penetrated a veil so\r\nthin, that covered only the usual supercilious arrogance which they had\r\nheretofore encountered. Lord Howe, almost alone among his military\r\ncontemporaries, warmly greeted them as fellow-countrymen, men of no\r\nalien or degenerate blood. He admitted at once the value of their\r\nexperience, sought their advice, and profited by both; thus gaining,\r\nbesides the material advantage of methods adapted to the difficulties\r\nbefore him, the adhesion of willing hearts that followed\r\nenthusiastically, confident in their leader's wisdom, and glowing with\r\nthe unaccustomed sense of being appreciated, of receiving recognition\r\nlong withheld, but now at last ungrudgingly accorded. \"The army felt\r\nhim, from general to drummer boy. He was its soul; and while breathing\r\ninto it his own energy and ardor, he broke through the traditions of the\r\nservice, and gave it new shapes to suit the time and place.... He made\r\nhimself greatly beloved by the provincial officers, and he did what he\r\ncould to break down the barriers between the colonial soldiers and the\r\nBritish regulars.\"[12]\r\n\r\nIn campaign, Lord Howe adopted the tried expedients of forest warfare,\r\nassociating with himself its most practised exponents; and on the\r\nmorning of his death, in one of those petty skirmishes which have cut\r\nshort the career of so many promising soldiers, he discussed the\r\nquestion of Ticonderoga and its approaches, lying on a bearskin beside\r\nthe colonial ranger, John Stark, to whose energy, nineteen years later,\r\nwas due the serious check that precipitated the ruin of Burgoyne's\r\nexpedition. Endeared as he was to American soldiers by the ties of\r\nmutual labors and mutual perils gladly shared, and to all classes by\r\ngenial bearing and social accomplishments, his untimely end was followed\r\nthroughout the Northern colonies by a spontaneous outburst of sorrow,\r\nelicited not only by the anticipated failure of the enterprise that hung\r\nupon his life, but also by a sense of personal regret and loss.\r\nMassachusetts perpetuated the memory of her grief by a tablet in\r\nWestminster Abbey, which hands down to our day \"the affection her\r\nofficers and soldiers bore to his command.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Richard Howe of the Royal Navy, afterwards Admiral and Earl,\r\nsucceeded him in the Irish viscounty which had been bestowed upon their\r\ngrandfather by William III. Of a temperament colder, at least in\r\nexternal manifestation, than that of his brother, the new Lord Howe was\r\ndistinguished by the same fairness of mind, and by an equanimity to\r\nwhich perturbation and impulsive injustice were alike unknown. There\r\nseems to have been in his bearing something of that stern, impassive\r\ngravity that marked Washington, and imposed a constraint upon\r\nbystanders; but whatever apparent harshness there was in the face only\r\nconcealed a genuine warmth of heart, which at times broke with an\r\nillumining smile through the mask that covered it, and was always ready\r\nto respond to the appeals of benevolence. If, as an officer, he had a\r\nfault conspicuously characteristic, it was a reluctance to severity, a\r\ntendency to push indulgence to undue extremes, into which may perhaps\r\nhave entered not merely leniency of disposition, but the weakness of\r\nloving popularity. To be called by the seamen, as Howe was, the\r\n\"sailor's friend,\" is in the experience of navies a suspicious encomium,\r\ninvolving more of flattery to a man's foibles than of credit to his\r\ndiscretion and his judgment. But at the time when the quarrel between\r\nGreat Britain and her colonies was fast becoming imbittered, the same\r\nkindliness, coupled with a calm reasonableness of temper, ruled his\r\nfeelings and guided his action. Although by political creed a moderate\r\nTory, he had none of the wrong-headedness of the party zealot; and the\r\ngrowing alienation between those whom he, like his brother, regarded as\r\nof one family, caused only distress and an earnest desire to avert\r\ncoming evils. Influenced by these sentiments, he sought the acquaintance\r\nof Franklin, then in London as a commissioner from the colonies; and the\r\ninterviews between them, while resultless by reason of the\r\nirreconcilable differences of opinion severing the two parties to the\r\ndispute, convinced the wary American of the good will and\r\nopen-mindedness of the already distinguished British seaman. The same\r\nqualities doubtless suggested the selection of Howe for the mission of\r\nconciliation to America, in 1776, where his associate was his younger\r\nbrother, Sir William, in whom the family virtues had, by exaggeration,\r\ndegenerated into an indolent good humor fatal to his military\r\nefficiency. The admiral, on the contrary, was not more remarkable for\r\namiability and resolute personal courage than he was for sustained\r\nenergy and untiring attention to duty,--traits which assured adequate\r\nnaval direction, in case conciliation should give place, as it did, to\r\ncoercive measures.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the methods, or the opportunities, of naval\r\nbiographers and historians of the past century have preserved to us\r\nlittle, in personal detail and anecdote, of a period the peculiarities\r\nof which, if not exactly picturesque, were at least grotesque and\r\namusing. The humor of Smollett has indeed drawn in broad caricature some\r\nof the salient features of the seaman of his day, which was that of\r\nHowe's entrance into the navy; and those who are familiar with the naval\r\nlight literature based upon the times of Nelson can recognize in it\r\ncharacteristics so similar, though evidently softened by advancing\r\ncivilization and increased contact with the world, as to vouch for the\r\naccuracy of the general impression conveyed by the earlier novelist. It\r\nis, however, correct only as a _general_ impression, in which, too,\r\nallowance must be made for the animus of an author who had grievances to\r\nexploit, and whose great aim was to amuse, even if exact truthfulness\r\nwere sacrificed at the shrine of exaggerated portrayal. Though not\r\nwholly without occasional gleams of light, shed here and there by\r\nrecorded incident and anecdote upon the strange life of the seamen of\r\nthat period, the early personal experiences of individuals have had\r\nscant commemoration; and with the exception of St. Vincent, who\r\nfortunately had a garrulous biographer, we learn little of men like\r\nHawke, Howe, Hood, and Keppel, until, already possessors of naval rank,\r\nthey stand forth as actors in events rather historical than\r\nbiographical.\r\n\r\nOf Howe's first services, therefore, not much record remains except a\r\nbare summary of dates,--of promotions, and of ships to which he was\r\nattached,--until 1755, the beginning of the Seven Years War, when he was\r\nalready a post-captain. Born in 1726, he entered the navy in 1739, at\r\nthe outbreak of the war with Spain which initiated a forty years'\r\nstruggle over colonies and colonial trade. With short intervals of\r\npeace, this contest was the prominent characteristic of the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century, and terminated in the conquest of Canada, the\r\nindependence of the United States, and the establishment of British\r\npredominance in India and upon the ocean. This rupture of a quiet that\r\nhad then endured a quarter of a century was so popular with the awakened\r\nintelligence of England, aroused at last to the imminent importance of\r\nher call to expansion by sea, that it was greeted by a general pealing\r\nof the bells, which drew from the reluctant prime minister, Walpole,\r\nthat bitter gibe, \"Ay, to-day they are ringing their bells, and\r\nto-morrow they will be wringing their hands.\" Howe embarked with Anson's\r\nsquadron, celebrated for its sufferings, its persistence, and its\r\nachievements, to waste the Spanish colonies of the Pacific; but the ship\r\nin which he had started was so racked in the attempt to double Cape Horn\r\nthat she was forced to return to England. The young officer afterwards\r\nserved actively in the West Indies and in home waters. On the 1st of\r\nMay, 1746, being then in command of a small sloop of war, he was\r\nseverely wounded in action with a superior enemy's force off the coast\r\nof Scotland. A few days before that, on the 10th of April, he had been\r\npromoted post-captain, being barely turned twenty. Thus early he was\r\nsecurely placed on the road to the highest honors of his profession,\r\nwhich, however, were not to prove beyond the just claim of his already\r\nestablished personal merit.\r\n\r\nDuring the first thirty months of the Seven Years War, Howe was closely\r\nengaged with, and at times in command of, the naval part of combined\r\nexpeditions of the army and navy, fitted out to harass the French\r\ncoasts. The chief, though not the sole aim in these undertakings was to\r\neffect diversions in favor of Frederick the Great, then plunged in his\r\ndesperate struggle with the allied forces of Russia, Austria, and\r\nFrance. It was believed that the last would be compelled, for the\r\ndefence of her own shores against those raids,--desultory, it is true\r\nbut yet uncertain as to the time and place where the attack would\r\nfall,--to withdraw a number of troops that would sensibly reduce the\r\ngreat odds then overbearing the Prussian king. It is more than doubtful\r\nwhether this direction of British power, in partial, eccentric efforts,\r\nproduced results adequate to the means employed. In immediate injury to\r\nFrance they certainly failed, and it is questionable whether they\r\nmaterially helped Frederick; but they made a brisk stir in the Channel\r\nports, their operations were within easy reach of England in a day when\r\nnews travelled slowly, and they drew the attention of the public and of\r\nLondon society in a degree wholly disproportionate to their importance\r\nrelatively to the great issues of the war. Their failures, which\r\nexceeded their achievements, caused general scandal; and their\r\noccasional triumphs aroused exaggerated satisfaction at this earlier\r\nperiod, before the round of unbroken successes under the first Pitt had\r\naccustomed men, to use Walpole's lively phrase, to come to breakfast\r\nwith the question, \"What new victory is there this morning?\" The\r\nbrilliant letter-writer's correspondence is full of the gossip arising\r\nfrom these usually paltry affairs; and throughout, whether in success or\r\ndisaster, the name of Howe appears frequently, and always as the subject\r\nof praise. \"Howe, brother of the lord of that name, was the third on the\r\nnaval list. He was undaunted as a rock, and as silent, the\r\ncharacteristics of his whole race. He and Wolfe soon contracted a\r\nfriendship like the union of cannon and gunpowder.\" \"Howe,\" he says in\r\nanother place, \"never made a friendship except at the mouth of a\r\ncannon.\"\r\n\r\nOf his professional merits, however, professional opinions will be more\r\nconvincing. A Frenchman, who had acted as pilot of his ship, the\r\n_Magnanime_, when going into action, was asked if it were possible to\r\ntake a lighter vessel, the _Burford_, close to the walls of another fort\r\nfarther in. \"Yes,\" he replied, \"but I should prefer to take the\r\n_Magnanime_.\" \"But why?\" it was rejoined; \"for the _Burford_ draws less\r\nwater.\" \"True,\" he said, \"_mais le capitaine Howe est jeune et brave_.\"\r\nSir Edward Hawke, the most distinguished admiral of that generation,\r\ngave a yet higher commendation to the \"young and brave\" captain, who at\r\nthis time served under his orders,--one that must cause a sigh of\r\nregretful desire to many a troubled superior. Several years later, when\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty, he nominated Howe, in October, 1770, to\r\ncommand a squadron destined to the Mediterranean, when hostilities with\r\nSpain were expected. The appointment was criticised on the ground that\r\nhe was a junior admiral in the fleet, having been very recently\r\npromoted; but Hawke, doubtless mindful that the same objection had been\r\nmade to him at a similar period of his career, answered, in the spirit\r\nof St. Vincent defending his choice of Nelson, \"I have tried Lord Howe\r\non most important occasions. He never asked me _how_ he was to execute\r\nany service entrusted to his charge, but always went straight forward\r\nand _did it_.\" Some quaint instances are recorded of the taciturnity for\r\nwhich he was also noted. Amid the recriminations that followed the\r\nfailure at Rochefort, Howe neither wrote nor said anything. At last the\r\nAdmiralty asked why he had not expressed an opinion. In the somewhat\r\nponderous style that marked his utterances, he replied, \"With regard to\r\nthe operations of the troops I was silent, as not being at that time\r\nwell enough informed thereof, and to avoid the mention of any\r\nparticulars that might prove not exactly agreeable to the truth.\" The\r\nnext year, an army officer of rank, putting questions to him and\r\nreceiving no answer, said, \"Mr. Howe, don't you hear me? I have asked\r\nyou several questions.\" Howe answered curtly, \"I don't like\r\nquestions,\"--in which he was perhaps not peculiar.\r\n\r\nIt was during the continuance of these petty descents upon the French\r\ncoast, in 1758, that Howe was directed to receive on board, as\r\nmidshipman, and for service in the fleet, the Duke of York, a grandson\r\nof the reigning monarch; in connection with whom arose a saying that was\r\nlong current, perhaps is still current, in the British navy. The young\r\nlad of nineteen, before beginning his routine duties, held a reception\r\non board Commodore Howe's ship, at which the captains of the squadron\r\nwere presented to him. The seamen, unpractised in ceremonial\r\ndistinctions other than naval, saw with wonder that the midshipman kept\r\non his hat, while the rest uncovered. \"The young gentleman,\" whispered\r\none, \"isn't over civil, as I thinks. Look if he don't keep his hat on\r\nbefore all the captains!\" \"Why,\" another was heard to reply, \"where\r\nshould he learn manners, seeing as how he was never at sea before?\"\r\n\r\nIt is likewise from this period of Howe's career that two of the rare\r\npersonal anecdotes have been transmitted, illustrative of his coolness\r\nand self-possession under all circumstances of danger, as well as when\r\nunder the enemy's fire; one of them also touched with a bit of\r\nhumor,--not a usual characteristic of his self-contained reticence. The\r\nservice involved considerable danger, being close in with the enemy's\r\ncoast, which was indifferently well known and subject to heavy gales of\r\nwind blowing dead on shore. On one such occasion his ship had anchored\r\nwith two anchors ahead, and he had retired to his cabin, when the\r\nofficer of the watch hurriedly entered, saying, \"My lord, the anchors\r\nare coming home,\"--the common sea expression for their failure to grip\r\nthe bottom, whereupon the ship of course drags toward the beach. \"Coming\r\nhome, are they?\" rejoined Howe. \"I am sure they are very right. I don't\r\nknow who would stay abroad on such a night, if he could help it.\" Yet\r\nanother time he was roused from sleep by a lieutenant in evident\r\nperturbation: \"My lord, the ship is on fire close to the magazine; but\r\ndon't be frightened; we shall get it under shortly.\" \"Frightened, sir!\"\r\nsaid Howe. \"What do you mean? I never was frightened in my life.\" Then,\r\nlooking the unlucky officer in the face, he continued, \"Pray, Mr. ----,\r\nhow does a man _feel_ when he is frightened? I need not ask how he\r\n_looks_.\"\r\n\r\nThe even, unaffected self-possession indicated by these anecdotes of the\r\nearly prime of life remained with him to the end, as is shown by another\r\nincident collected by a biographer who knew many of his contemporaries.\r\n\"When Howe was in command of the Channel Fleet, after a dark and\r\nboisterous night, in which the ships had been in some danger of running\r\nfoul of each other, Lord Gardner, then the third in command, the next\r\nday went on board the _Queen Charlotte_ and inquired of Lord Howe how he\r\nhad slept, for that he himself had not been able to get any rest from\r\nanxiety of mind. Lord Howe said he had slept perfectly well, for as he\r\nhad taken every possible precaution he could before dark, he laid\r\nhimself down with a conscious feeling that everything had been done,\r\nwhich it was in his power to do, for the safety of the ships, and the\r\nlives of those intrusted to his care, and this conviction set his mind\r\nat ease.\" The apprehensiveness with which Gardner was afflicted \"is\r\nfurther exemplified by an anecdote told by Admiral Sir James Whitshed,\r\nwho commanded the _Alligator_, next him in the line. Such was his\r\nanxiety, even in ordinary weather, that, though each ship carried three\r\npoop lanterns, he always kept one burning in his cabin, and when he\r\nthought the _Alligator_ was approaching too near he used to run out into\r\nthe stern gallery with the lantern in his hand, waving it so as to be\r\nnoticed.\" From Gardner's rank at the time, the conversation narrated\r\nmust have occurred during the early years of the French Revolution, when\r\nHowe was over sixty-seven. As illustrative of character it is\r\nparticularly interesting, for Gardner was not only a much younger man,\r\nbut one whose gallantry and competence had been eminently proved as a\r\ncaptain in several hard fought battles, while as an admiral in chief\r\ncommand he later acquired considerable reputation as a tactician.\r\n\r\nComposure under suspense is chiefly a matter of temperament; of the\r\nconstitutional outfit with which Nature favors some, and does not\r\nothers. It may be cultivated by its happy possessor; but when wanting,\r\nthe sufferer can supply its place only by laborious self-control, the\r\ntension of which by itself expends the energies it seeks to maintain,\r\nand so imposes limitations of strength that are often insuperable\r\nobstacles to achievement, especially if prolonged. The strain of this\r\nendurance is prominent among those borne by commanders-in-chief, who can\r\nat no moment afford to be lax, nor yet precipitate; and it increases\r\nwith time at compound interest. Howe's native imperturbability was\r\ntherefore one of the chief factors in his great professional powers,\r\nmaking possible the full exercise of all the others. By dint of it\r\nprincipally he reached the eminence which must be attributed to him as a\r\ngeneral officer; for it underlay the full, continuous, and sustained\r\nplay of the very marked faculties, personal and professional, natural\r\nand acquired, which he had. It insured that they should be fully\r\ndeveloped, and should not flag; for it preserved his full command over\r\nthem by delivering him from the factitious burdens of the imagination.\r\n\r\nThis quality not only entered into his external professional life, but\r\ncharacterized the habitual temper of his mind. \"He divested himself in a\r\nremarkable manner,\" says his biographer, \"of every approach to a state\r\nof anger or resentment\"--instancing herein, it may be noted, the\r\nimprovement of a natural gift; \"and he carefully abstained from all\r\nirritating language, whether in speaking or writing. In the perusal of\r\nthe four hundred letters and upwards that have been mentioned, embracing\r\nopinions of, and unreserved discussions upon, the merits or otherwise of\r\nmany and various characters, of all classes of individuals, it did not\r\nfail forcibly to strike the reader of them, how invariably, with one\r\nsingle exception, he takes the good natured and favorable side of every\r\nquestion. In the whole series, the harshest word employed is\r\n'blockhead,' bestowed on his steward for not taking care of his _own_\r\ninterests.\"\r\n\r\nThis equable frame of mind was thus a fundamental trait in Howe, private\r\nas well as public, personal as well as professional; not assumed for the\r\nmoment, but constant in operation. He had none of the irritability\r\nattributed to genius, as also he gives no sign of its inspiration,--of\r\noriginality. He is seen at his strongest in dealing stage by stage with\r\ndifficult situations created for him, following step by step, and step\r\nby step checking, the lead of another; his action being elicited by\r\nsuccessive circumstances, not deriving from some creative, far-reaching\r\nconception of his own. The temperament is one eminently practical,\r\ncapable on due opportunity of very great deeds, as Howe showed; for,\r\nhaving improved much native capacity by the constant cultivation of\r\nprofessional knowledge, and with the self-confidence which naturally\r\nsprings from such acquisition, he rose readily to the level of exertion\r\ndemanded by any emergency not in excess of his abilities, and so long as\r\nthe need lasted maintained himself there easily, without consciousness\r\nof exhaustive effort, or apprehension of improbable contingencies.\r\n\"Never hasting, never resting,\" might be safely affirmed of him.\r\n\r\nHe is seen therefore at his best in a defensive campaign, such as that\r\nagainst D'Estaing in the summer of 1778, which in the writer's opinion\r\nwas his greatest achievement; or again in a great deliberate operation\r\nlike the relief of Gibraltar,--the one of his deeds most esteemed, it is\r\nsaid, by himself,--protracted over a month in its performance, and\r\nessentially defensive in character, not only because of the much\r\nsuperior fleet of the enemies, but because the adverse forces of nature\r\nand the obstinate incapacity of the captains of supply ships had to be\r\ncounteracted by unremitting watchfulness, foresight, and skill, dealing\r\nhowever with conditions determined for him, not imposed by his own\r\ninitiative; or, finally, in the chase and partial actions of May 28 and\r\n29, 1794, in which persistence, endurance, and aptitude are alike and\r\nequally displayed, assuring to him beyond dispute the credit of a great\r\ntactician. Accordingly, in direct consequence of what has been noted, it\r\nis as a tactician, and not as a strategist, that he can claim rank; for\r\nwhatever may be the fundamental identity of principles in the military\r\nart, whether applied to strategy or to tactics, it in the end remains\r\ntrue that the tactician deals with circumstances immediately before him\r\nand essentially transient, while the strategist has to take wider views\r\nof more lasting conditions, and into them to introduce his own\r\nconceptions to be modifying factors. Creative thought and faculty of\r\ninitiation are therefore more characteristic of the natural endowments\r\nof the born strategist. There is also more room for them in his work,\r\nbecause in the larger and more complicated field there is greater\r\nelasticity and opportunity to effect new combinations, to contrive which\r\nmakes a greater call upon originative power.\r\n\r\nIn the chain of eminent typical names which leads up to that of Nelson,\r\nthere will be found between Howe and his next conspicuous\r\nsuccessor,--conspicuous, that is, not only by merit, as was Hood, but by\r\nachievement, which was denied to Hood,--between Howe and Jervis, just\r\nthat difference which essentially separates the tactician from the\r\nstrategist: the lifting of the eye from the moves of the game\r\nimmediately before one, to glance over the whole board, to view the\r\nwider field, and from its possibilities to form conceptions directive of\r\nimmediate action for distant ends. In both these distinguished general\r\nofficers,--for such both were,--there is seen a similar close attention\r\nto details, based upon and guided by an acquaintance with their\r\nprofession profound as well as extensive, minute as well as general; in\r\nboth the same diligence and iron equanimity in difficult situations,\r\nalthough in Jervis the impression received is rather that of a burden\r\nborne with resolute fortitude, whereas in Howe the burden is thrown off\r\nby a placid, unforeboding temper; but in the adoption of measures, those\r\nof Howe will be found generally not to extend beyond the situation\r\nimmediately before him, by which they are dictated, whereas Jervis seeks\r\nto bend circumstances to his will, according to a conception he has\r\nformed of what the situation ought to be, and can be forced to become.\r\n\r\nThe idiosyncrasy of either officer is emphasized in their respective\r\nplans of campaign, while commanding the Channel Fleet during the French\r\nRevolution. Howe will maintain a certain station in port, keeping his\r\nfleet there in hand, well conditioned, and as far as may be well\r\ndrilled; then, when the French do something, he also will do something\r\nto counteract them. Jervis, on the contrary, confronting substantially\r\nthe same conditions, frames his measures with a view to prevent the\r\nenemy from doing anything, and all the details of his plan rest upon\r\nthis one idea, to the fulfilment of which they contribute. He puts the\r\nfleet at once into the position of action, instead of that of awaiting,\r\nas Howe does. Both are charged with the same duty,--the defence of Great\r\nBritain,--and by the same Government, which evidently in each case\r\nframes its instructions upon the ascertained views of the eminent\r\nofficer intrusted with the work. To carry out this defensive campaign,\r\nHowe of his own choice narrows his strategic plan to the sheer\r\ndefensive, which follows the initiative of the enemy; Jervis of set\r\npurpose seeks the same object by offensive dispositions, by which the\r\nenemy is to be forced to regulate his movements. Howe sees the defence\r\nof the empire in the preservation of his own fleet; Jervis in the\r\ndestruction of the enemy. The one view is local, narrow, and negative;\r\nthe other general, broad, and positive. As often happens--and very\r\nnaturally--Jervis's preoccupation with considerations wider than his own\r\ncommand found expression, twice at least, in phrases which pithily\r\nsummed up his steadfast enduring habit of mind. On the morning of St.\r\nVincent he was overheard to mutter, \"A victory is very necessary to\r\nEngland at this time.\" The present odds to his own fleet, twenty-seven\r\nagainst fifteen, disappeared in the larger needs of the country. Again,\r\nwhen wrestling with the perplexities and exigencies of the wild Brest\r\nblockade in midwinter, in January, 1801, he wrote concerning repairs to\r\nhis own vessels, \"Under the present impending storm from the north of\r\nEurope, and the necessity there is of equipping every ship in the royal\r\nports that can swim, no ship under my command must have anything done to\r\nher at Plymouth or Portsmouth that can be done at this anchorage,\"--at\r\nTorbay, an open though partially sheltered roadstead. Here again is seen\r\nthe subordination of the particular and personal care to the broad\r\nconsiderations of a great strategic emergency.\r\n\r\nThe series of diversions upon the French coast in which Howe was\r\nemployed during 1758, terminated with that season, and he returned to\r\nhis own ship, the _Magnanime_, rejoining with her the main fleet under\r\nHawke in the great Brest blockade of 1759. The French Government, after\r\nfour years of disaster upon the continent, of naval humiliation, and of\r\nloss of maritime and colonial power, had now realized that its worst\r\nevils and chief danger sprang from the sea power of Great Britain, and,\r\nlike Napoleon a half-century later, determined to attempt an invasion.\r\nIts preparations and Hawke's dispositions to counteract them, have been\r\ndescribed in the life of that admiral, as have Rodney's bombardment of\r\nHavre and interception of coastwise communications; all directed to the\r\nsame general end of confounding designs against England, but no longer\r\nas mere diversions in favor of Frederick. Howe was still a private\r\ncaptain, but he bore a characteristically conspicuous part in the stormy\r\nfinal scene at Quiberon, when Hawke drove Conflans before him to utter\r\nconfusion. When the French fleet was sighted, the _Magnanime_ had been\r\nsent ahead to make the land. She was thus in the lead in the headlong\r\nchase which ensued, and was among the first in action; at 3 P.M., by\r\nHowe's journal, the firing having begun at 2.30, according to Hawke's\r\ndespatch. The foreyard being soon shot away, the consequent loss of\r\nmanoeuvring power impeded her captain's designs in placing her, but she\r\nremained closely engaged throughout, compelling one French vessel to\r\nstrike and anchor alongside her. The bad weather prevented taking\r\npossession that night of the prize, which, in consequence, availed\r\nherself of her liberty by running ashore, and so was lost to her\r\ncaptors. The _Magnanime_ was reported as having thirteen killed and\r\nsixty-six wounded, out of a total of hurt not much exceeding three\r\nhundred in the entire fleet. The casualty list proves exposure to fire,\r\ndoubtless; but is no sure test of the effectiveness of a vessel's\r\naction. The certainty of Howe's conduct in this affair, otherwise\r\nimperfectly described, rests on a broader and firmer basis of\r\nreputation, won by unvarying efficiency in many differing capacities and\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nHe continued to serve, but without further noteworthy incident, up to\r\nthe peace made in the winter of 1762-63. From that time until the\r\ndifficulties with the American colonies came to a head in 1775, he was\r\nnot actively employed afloat, although continuously engaged upon\r\nprofessional matters, especially as a close student of naval tactics and\r\nits kindred subjects, to which he always gave sympathetic attention.\r\nDuring this period, also, he became a member of the House of Commons,\r\nand so continued until transferred from the Irish peerage to that of\r\nGreat Britain, in 1782. In 1770, at the age of forty-five, he became a\r\nrear-admiral, and, as has been already stated, received at once a proof\r\nof Hawke's high confidence, by being appointed to the command of the\r\nsquadron destined for the Mediterranean, when hostilities concerning the\r\nFalkland Islands threatened with Spain; a dispute chiefly memorable as\r\nthe means of bringing into the navy both Nelson and Exmouth. In 1775 he\r\nwas promoted to vice-admiral, and in February of the following year was\r\nappointed commander-in-chief of the North American station. Together\r\nwith his military duties, he was, as has before been said, given powers,\r\nconjointly with his brother, to treat for the settlement of existing\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nAlthough his habitual reticence restrained his sentiments from finding\r\nexpression in positive words, there can be little doubt that the\r\nnecessity of raising his hand against the Americans caused Howe keener\r\nregret than it did to many of his brother officers. He took instant\r\noccasion to address to Franklin a personal note, recalling their former\r\nassociation, and expressing an earnest hope that their friendship might\r\ncontribute something to insure the success of his official mission. In\r\nthe five years that had elapsed, however, Franklin had been in the heat\r\nof the political struggle, and, philosopher though he was, he had not\r\nHowe's natural phlegm. Hence, his reply, while marked by respect and\r\neven formal cordiality toward the admiral himself, displayed a vivacity\r\nof resentment and a bitterness for which the latter had scarcely looked.\r\nStill, his habitual equanimity was not ruffled, and he read the letter\r\nwith the simple comment, \"My old friend expresses himself very warmly.\"\r\n\r\nHowe's arrival antedated the signature of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence by less than a week. During the period of attempted\r\nnegotiation, while scrupulously faithful to his instructions, he showed\r\nto his late fellow-countrymen all the courtesy and consideration that\r\nthe most cordial esteem could extend. The incident of the official\r\ncommunication addressed by the Howes to Washington, in which they sought\r\nto evade giving him the title of \"General,\" is sufficiently familiar;\r\nbut it is more rarely recalled that, in verbal intercourse with American\r\nofficers, the admiral habitually styled him \"General Washington,\" and\r\nsent complimentary messages to him as such. He even spoke of the\r\ncolonies as \"states,\" and at the same time dwelt with evident emotion\r\nupon the testimonials of respect and affection which had been shown to\r\nhis brother's memory by the colonists.\r\n\r\nTo narrate Howe's share in the operations by which New York in 1776, and\r\nPhiladelphia in 1777, fell into the hands of the British, would be only\r\nto repeat well-known historical episodes, enlivened by few or no\r\nincidents personal to himself. In them the navy played a part at once\r\nsubordinate and indispensable, as is the office of a foundation to its\r\nsuperstructure. The cause of the Americans was hopeless as long as their\r\nwaters remained in the undisputed control of the enemy's ships; and it\r\nwas the attempt of Great Britain to cast aside this essential support,\r\nand to rely upon the army alone in a wild and intricate country, that\r\nled to her first great disaster,--Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga. Upon\r\nthis, France at once recognized the independence of the colonies, and\r\ntheir alliance with that kingdom followed. A French fleet of twelve\r\nships-of-the-line under the Count D'Estaing, left Toulon April 15, 1778,\r\nfor the American coast. This force far exceeded Howe's; and it was no\r\nthanks to the British Government, but only to the admiral's sleepless\r\nvigilance and activity, seconded, as such qualities are apt to be, by at\r\nleast an average degree of supineness on the part of his antagonist,\r\nthat his scanty squadron was not surprised and overpowered in Delaware\r\nBay, when Sir Henry Clinton evacuated Philadelphia to retreat upon New\r\nYork. Howe, who had the defects of his qualities, whose deliberate and\r\nalmost stolid exterior evinced a phlegmatic composure of spirit which\r\nrequired the spur of imminent emergency to rouse it into vehement\r\naction, never in his long career appeared to greater advantage, nor\r\nachieved military results more truly brilliant, than at this time, and\r\nup to the abandonment of the attack on Rhode Island by the Americans\r\nunder Sullivan, three months later. Then only, if ever, did he rise\r\nabove the level of an accomplished and resolute general officer, and\r\nestablish a claim to genius, of that order, however, which is not\r\noriginative in character, but signalized by an infinite capacity for\r\ntaking pains; and that not for a short time merely, but through a long,\r\nprotracted period of strain. The display, nevertheless, does not assure\r\nhim a place in the front rank of great commanders, whose actions find\r\ntheir source in the living impulse of their own creative energy; for it\r\nis elicited by extreme circumstances alone, by obvious pressure, to\r\nwhich he must adapt himself. This he does with unfailing adequacy,\r\nindeed; resolutely checkmating, but never initiating. Steady as a rock,\r\nlike a rock, also, Howe only gave forth sparks under blows that would\r\nhave broken weaker men.\r\n\r\nD'Estaing was twelve weeks in coming from Toulon to Cape May, but Howe\r\nknew nothing of his sailing until three weeks after he had started. Then\r\norders were received to abandon Philadelphia and concentrate upon New\r\nYork. The naval forces were scattered, and had to be collected; the\r\nsupplies of the army, except those needed for the march across Jersey,\r\nwere to be embarked at Philadelphia, and the great train of transports\r\nand ships of war moved over a hundred miles down a difficult river, and\r\nthence to New York. Despite every effort, a loss of ten days was\r\nincurred, through calms, in the mere transit from Philadelphia to the\r\nsea; but during this momentous crisis D'Estaing did not appear. Two days\r\nmore sufficed to bring the fleet into New York Bay on June 29th; but yet\r\nthe grave admiral, roused to the full tension of his great abilities,\r\nrested not. With a force little more than half that coming against him,\r\nhe knew that all depended upon the rapidity with which his squadron took\r\nthe imposing position he had in mind. Still D'Estaing tarried, giving\r\nto his untiring enemy twelve more precious days, during which the army\r\nof Sir Henry Clinton, reaching Navesink beach the day after the fleet,\r\nwas snatched by it from the hot pursuit of the disappointed Washington,\r\nand carried safely to New York.\r\n\r\nIn the expected French squadron were eight ships of seventy-four guns or\r\nover, with three sixty-fours. To confront these, for the defence of the\r\nport, Howe disposed of six, none heavier than a sixty-four; but they\r\nwere ranged to command the entrance of the harbor upon a tactical plan\r\nthat evinced both a careful study of the ground and the resources of a\r\nthorough seaman. This instance alone, had Howe never done anything else,\r\nwould have established his reputation as a tactician. The ships, placed\r\nin échelon, and enabled to turn their batteries in any direction, by the\r\nprovision of springs and adaptation to the tide conditions at the moment\r\nwhen alone attack would be possible, could concentrate their entire\r\nforce of guns upon the enemy, raking them as they advanced up channel;\r\nwhile, if they succeeded in coming abreast, then also the broadsides\r\nwould be turned upon them. When D'Estaing at last came, all was ready;\r\nthe energy that had improved every fleeting moment then gave place to\r\nthe imperturbable resolution which was Howe's greatest attribute, and\r\nagainst which, seconded by his careful preparation, success could be\r\nwon only by a desperate and sanguinary struggle. The attempt was not\r\nmade. Ten days after arriving, the French admiral again put to sea,\r\nheading to the southward. By combined energy and skill Howe had won the\r\nfirst move in the game. Clinton's army and New York were saved.\r\n\r\n\"The arrival of the French fleet,\" wrote Washington a little later, \"is\r\na great and striking event; but the operations of it have been injured\r\nby a number of unforeseen and unfavorable circumstances, which have\r\nlessened the importance of its services to a great degree. The length of\r\nthe passage, in the first instance, was a capital misfortune; for, had\r\neven one of common length taken place, Lord Howe, with the British ships\r\nof war and all the transports in the river Delaware, must inevitably\r\nhave fallen; and Sir Henry Clinton must have had better luck than is\r\ncommonly dispensed to men of his profession under such circumstances, if\r\nhe and his troops had not shared at least the fate of Burgoyne.\" If this\r\nnarration of events is so carefully worded as not to imply a censure\r\nupon D'Estaing, it none the less, however unintentionally, measures the\r\ngreat military merit of Lord Howe.\r\n\r\nNor did this end his achievements. Two or three days after the French\r\ndeparted a small reinforcement from England reached New York, and in the\r\ncourse of a week Howe, who had not failed to keep touch with the enemy's\r\nfleet till it was ninety miles at sea, heard that it had been seen\r\nagain, heading for Narragansett Bay, then controlled by a British\r\ngarrison on Rhode Island. This was in pursuance of a prearranged plan to\r\nsupport the American forces under General Sullivan, which had already\r\nadvanced against the place. Adapting anew his action to the\r\ncircumstances of the enemy's movements, Howe, though still much\r\ninferior, hurried to the spot, arriving and anchoring off Point Judith,\r\nat the entrance to Newport, on August 9th, the day after D'Estaing had\r\nrun the fire of the British works and entered the harbor. With correct\r\nstrategic judgment, with a flash of insight which did not usually\r\ndistinguish him when an enemy was not in view, and contrary to his\r\navowed policy when commander of the Channel Fleet, he saw that the true\r\nposition for his squadron was in face of the hostile port, ready to act\r\nas circumstances might dictate. His mere presence blocked this operation\r\nalso. D'Estaing, either fearing that the British admiral might take the\r\noffensive and gain some unexpected advantage, or tempted by the apparent\r\nopportunity of crushing a small hostile division, put to sea the next\r\nday. Howe, far superior as a seaman to his antagonist, manoeuvred to\r\navoid a battle with a force superior by a half to his own; and this\r\npurpose was effected by his skilful management of his fleet, aided by\r\nhis adversary's irresolution, notwithstanding that the unusual action of\r\nthe wind thwarted his effort to control the situation by gaining the\r\nweather gage. Both the general manoeuvres, and the special dispositions\r\nmade of his ships to meet the successive intentions of the enemy, as\r\nthey became apparent, showed a mind fortified by previous preparation as\r\nwell as by the natural self-possession for which he was conspicuous. It\r\nwas eminently a tactical triumph.\r\n\r\nA tremendous gale followed, scattered both fleets, and dismasted several\r\nof the French. D'Estaing appeared again off Rhode Island only to notify\r\nSullivan that he could no longer aid him; and the latter, deprived of an\r\nindispensable support, withdrew in confusion. The disappointment of the\r\nAmericans showed itself by mobbing some French seamen in Boston, whither\r\ntheir fleet retired. \"After the enterprise upon Rhode Island had been\r\nplanned,\" continues Washington, in the letter above quoted, \"and was in\r\nthe moment of execution, that Lord Howe with the British ships should\r\ninterpose merely to create a diversion, and draw the French fleet from\r\nthe island, was again unlucky, as the Count had not returned on the 17th\r\nto the island, though drawn from it on the 10th; by which the whole was\r\nsubjected to a miscarriage.\" What Washington politicly calls bad luck\r\nwas French bad management, provoked and baffled by Howe's accurate\r\nstrategy, untiring energy, consummate seamanship, and tactical\r\nproficiency. Clinton's army delivered, the forcing of New York\r\nfrustrated, Rhode Island and its garrison saved, by a squadron never\r\nmore than two thirds of that opposed to it, were achievements to\r\nillustrate any career; and the more so that they were effected by sheer\r\nscientific fencing, like some of Bonaparte's greatest feats, with little\r\nloss of blood. They form Howe's highest title to fame, and his only\r\nclaim as a strategist. It will be observed, however, that the\r\ncharacteristic of his course throughout is untiring and adequate\r\nadaption to the exigencies of the situation, as momentarily determined\r\nby the opponent's movements. There is in it no single original step.\r\nSuch, indeed, is commonly the case with a strictly defensive campaign by\r\na decisively inferior force. It is only the rare men who solve such\r\ndifficulties by unexpected exceptional action.\r\n\r\nIt is indicative of Howe's personal feelings about the colonial quarrel,\r\nduring the two years in which he thus ably discharged his official\r\nduties, that both he and his brother determined to ask relief from their\r\ncommands as soon as it appeared that all hopes of conciliation were\r\nover. The appointment of other commissioners hastened their decision,\r\nand the permission to return was already in the admiral's hands when the\r\nnews of D'Estaing's coming was received. Fighting a traditional foreign\r\nfoe was a different thing from shedding the blood of men between whom\r\nand himself there was so much in common; nor was Howe the man to dodge\r\nresponsibility by turning over an inferior force, threatened by such\r\nheavy odds, to a junior officer before the new commander-in-chief came.\r\nHis resolution to remain was as happy for his renown as it was\r\ncreditable to his character. After the brief campaign just sketched,\r\ntrue to his steady previous policy, he followed the French fleet to\r\nNewport when he heard of its reappearance there, and thence to Boston,\r\ncoming off that port only three days after it; but finding it now\r\nsheltered under shore batteries, impregnable to his still inferior\r\nnumbers, and learning that it was in need of extensive repairs, he\r\nresigned the command in New York to a rear-admiral, and departed to\r\nNewport to meet his successor, Vice-Admiral Byron. Upon the latter's\r\narrival he sailed for England, towards the end of September, 1778.\r\nGeneral Howe had preceded him by four months.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers went home with feelings of great resentment against the\r\nministry. The course of the war had so far been unfortunate. The loss of\r\nBoston, the surrender of Burgoyne, the evacuation of Philadelphia, and\r\nfinally the entrance of France into the contest, constituted a\r\ncombination of mishaps which certainly implied fault somewhere. As\r\nusual, no one was willing to accept blame, and hot disputes, with\r\ninjurious imputations, raged in Parliament. There is here, happily, no\r\nnecessity for apportioning the responsibility, except in the case of\r\nLord Howe; and as to him, it is reasonably clear that all was done that\r\ncould be up to the coming of the French, while it is incontestable that\r\nafterwards, with a force utterly inadequate, for which the Government\r\nwas answerable, he had averted imminent disaster by most masterly\r\nmanagement. His words in the House of Commons were bitter. \"He had been\r\ndeceived into his command, and he was deceived while he retained it.\r\nTired and disgusted, he had desired permission to resign it; and he\r\nwould have returned as soon as he obtained leave, but he could not think\r\nof doing so while a superior enemy remained in American seas; that, as\r\nsoon as that impediment was removed, he gladly embraced the first\r\nopportunity of returning to Europe. Such, and the recollection of what\r\nhe had suffered, were his motives for resigning the command, and such\r\nfor declining any future service so long as the present ministry\r\nremained in office.\"\r\n\r\nIn terms like these could officers holding seats in Parliament speak\r\nconcerning the Government of the day. It was a period in which not only\r\ndid party feeling run high, but corruption was an almost avowed method\r\nof political management. The navy itself was split into factions by\r\npolitical bias and personal jealousies, and there was a saying that \"if\r\na naval officer were to be roasted, another officer could always be\r\nfound to turn the spit.\" The head of the Admiralty, Lord Sandwich, was a\r\nman of much ability, but also of profligate character, as well public as\r\nprivate. He doubtless wished the success of his department,--under the\r\nterrible chances of war no chief can do otherwise, for the\r\nresponsibility of failure must fall upon his own head; but through\r\ncorrupt administration the strength of the navy, upon the outbreak of\r\nwar, had been unequal to the work it had to do. Some one must suffer for\r\nthis remissness, and who more naturally than the commander of a distant\r\nstation, who confessed himself \"no politician\"? Hence, Howe certainly\r\nthought, the neglect with which he had been treated. \"It would not be\r\nprudent to trust the little reputation he had earned by forty years'\r\nservice, his personal honor and everything else he held dear, in the\r\nhands of men who have neither the ability to act on their own judgment,\r\nnor the integrity and good sense to follow the advice of others who\r\nmight know more of the matter.\" A year later, it was roundly charged\r\nthat the Channel Fleet had been brought home at a most critical moment,\r\nlosing an exceptional opportunity for striking the enemy, in order to\r\naffect the elections in a dockyard town. Admiral Keppel considered that\r\nhe had been sacrificed to party feeling; and a very distinguished\r\nofficer, Barrington, refused to take a fleet, although willing to serve\r\nas second, even under a junior. \"Who,\" he wrote, \"would trust himself in\r\nchief command with such a set of scoundrels as are now in office?\" Even\r\na quarter of a century later, Earl St. Vincent gave to George III.\r\nhimself the same reason for declining employment. After eliciting from\r\nhim an unfavorable opinion as to the discipline and efficiency of the\r\nChannel Fleet, the king asked, \"Where such evils exist, does Lord St.\r\nVincent feel justified in refusing his conspicuous ability to remedy\r\nthem?\" \"My life,\" replied the old seaman, \"is at your Majesty's\r\ndisposal, and at that of my country; but my honour is in my own keeping,\r\nand I will not expose myself to the risk of losing it by the\r\nmachinations of this ministry, under which I should hold command.\" To\r\nsuch feelings it was due that Howe, Keppel, and Barrington did not go to\r\nsea during the anxious three years that followed the return of the\r\nfirst. The illustrious Rodney, their only rival, but in himself a host,\r\nwas the one distinguished naval chief who belonged heart and soul to the\r\nparty with which Sandwich was identified.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that Rodney's period of activity during the war of the\r\nAmerican Revolution coincided substantially with that of Howe's\r\nretirement. The same change of administration, in the spring of 1782,\r\nthat led to the recall of the older man, brought Howe again into\r\nservice, to replace the mediocrities who for three campaigns had\r\ncommanded the Channel Fleet, the mainstay of Great Britain's safety.\r\nUpon it depended not only the protection of the British Islands and of\r\nthe trade routes converging upon them, but also the occasional\r\nrevictualling of Gibraltar, now undergoing the third year of the famous\r\nsiege. Its operations extended to the North Sea, where the Dutch, now\r\nhostile, flanked the road to the Baltic, whence came the naval stores\r\nessential to the efficiency of the British fleet; to the Bay of Biscay,\r\nintercepting the convoys despatched from France to her navies abroad;\r\nand to the Chops of the Channel, where focussed the trade routes from\r\nEast and West, and where more than once heavy losses had been inflicted\r\nupon British commerce by the allies. All these services received\r\nconspicuous and successful illustration during Howe's brief command, at\r\nthe hands either of the commander-in-chief or of his subordinates, among\r\nwhom were the very distinguished Barrington and Kempenfelt. Howe\r\nhimself, with twenty-five sail-of-the-line, in July encountered an\r\nallied fleet of forty off Scilly. By an adroit tactical movement, very\r\ncharacteristic of his resolute and adequate presence of mind, he carried\r\nhis ships between Scilly and Land's End by night, disappearing before\r\nmorning from the enemy's view. He thus succeeded in meeting to the\r\nwestward a valuable Jamaica convoy, homeward bound, and taking it under\r\nhis protection. The allies being afterwards driven south by a heavy\r\ngale, the vessels of war and trade slipped by and reached England\r\nsafely. Thus does good luck often give its blessing to good management.\r\n\r\nTo relieve Gibraltar, however, was the one really great task,\r\ncommensurate to his abilities, that devolved upon Howe during this\r\nshort command. In the summer of 1782, the Spaniards were completing ten\r\nheavy floating batteries, expected to be impervious to shot and to\r\ncombustion, and from an attack by which upon the sea front of the works\r\ndecisive results were anticipated. At the same time prolonged blockade\r\nby land and sea, supported by forty-nine allied ships-of-the-line\r\nanchored at Algeciras, the Spanish port on the opposite side of the Bay,\r\nwas producing its inevitable results, and the place was now in the last\r\nextremity for provisions and munitions of war. To oppose the hostile\r\nfleets and introduce the essential succors, to carry which required\r\nthirty-one sail of supply ships, Great Britain could muster only\r\nthirty-four of-the-line, but to them were adjoined the superb\r\nprofessional abilities of Lord Howe, never fully evoked except when in\r\nsight of an enemy, as he here must act, with Barrington and Kempenfelt\r\nas seconds; the one the pattern of the practical, experienced, division\r\ncommander, tested on many occasions, the other an officer much of Howe's\r\nown stamp, and like him a diligent student and promoter of naval\r\nmanoeuvres and naval signals, to the development of which both had\r\ngreatly contributed. To the train of supply ships were added for convoy\r\na number of merchant vessels destined to different parts of the world,\r\nso that the grand total which finally sailed on September 11th was 183.\r\nWhile this great body was gathering at Spithead, there occurred the\r\ncelebrated incident of the oversetting of the _Royal George_ at her\r\nanchors, on August 29th,\r\n\r\n    \"When Kempenfelt went down\r\n      With twice four hundred men.\"\r\n\r\nHowe thus lost the man upon whom principally he must have relied for the\r\nmore purely tactical development of the fleet, opportunity for which he\r\nanticipated in the necessarily slow and graduated progress of so large\r\nan assemblage.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was indeed one that called for deliberation as well as for\r\ncalculated audacity, both controlled by a composure and ability rarely\r\nconjoined to the same great extent as in Howe. Circumstances were more\r\nimminent than in the two previous reliefs by Rodney and Darby; for the\r\ngreatly superior numbers of the allies were now not in Cadiz, as before,\r\nbut lying only four miles from the anchorage which the supply vessels\r\nmust gain. True, certainly, that for these a certain portion of their\r\npath would be shielded by the guns of the fortress, but a much greater\r\npart would be wholly out of their range; and the mere question of\r\nreaching his berth, a navigational problem complicated by uncertain\r\nwinds, and by a very certain current sweeping in from the Atlantic, was\r\nextremely difficult for the merchant skipper of the day, a seaman rough\r\nand ready, but not always either skilful or heedful. The problem before\r\nHowe demanded therefore the utmost of his seamanlike qualities and of\r\nhis tactical capacity.\r\n\r\nThe length of the passage speaks for the deliberate caution of Howe's\r\nmanagement, as his conduct at the critical moment of approach, and\r\nduring the yet more critical interval of accomplishing the entrance of\r\nthe supply ships, evinces the cool and masterful self-control which\r\nalways assured the complete and sustained exertion of his great\r\nprofessional powers at a required instant. Thirty days were consumed in\r\nthe voyage from Spithead to Gibraltar, but no transport was dropped. Of\r\nthe huge convoy even, it is narrated that after a heavy gale, just\r\nbefore reaching Cape Finisterre, the full tally of 183 was counted.\r\nAfter passing that cape, the traders probably parted for their several\r\ndestinations, each body under a suitable escort. The stoppages for the\r\nrounding-up of straying or laggard vessels, or for re-establishing the\r\nobservance of order which ever contributes to regulated movement, and\r\nthrough it to success, were not in this case time lost. The admiral made\r\nof them opportunities for exercising his ships-of-the-line in the new\r\nsystem of signals, and in the simple evolutions depending upon them,\r\nwhich underlie flexibility of action, and in the day of battle enable\r\nthe fleet to respond to the purposes of its commander with reasonable\r\nprecision, and in mutual support.\r\n\r\nSuch drill was doubly necessary, for it not only familiarized the\r\nintelligence of the captains with ideas too generally neglected by\r\nseamen until called upon to put them into practice, and revealed to them\r\ndifficulties not realized until encountered, but also enforced\r\nrecognition of the particular qualities of each vessel, upon the due\r\nobservance of which substantial accuracy of manoeuvre depends. The\r\nexperience gained during this cruise, going and returning, probably\r\nopened the eyes of many officers to unsuspected deficiencies in\r\nthemselves, in handling a ship under the exigencies of fleet tactics.\r\nHowe certainly was in this respect disappointed in his followers, but\r\nprobably not greatly surprised. At the same time it is but fair to note\r\nthat the service was performed throughout without any marked hitch\r\ntraceable to want of general professional ability. A French writer has\r\ncommented upon this. \"There occurred none of those events, so frequent\r\nin the experiences of a squadron, which often oblige admirals to take a\r\ncourse wholly contrary to the end they have in view. It is impossible\r\nnot to recall the unhappy incidents which, from the 9th to the 12th of\r\nApril, of this same year, befell the squadron of the Count De Grasse. If\r\nit is just to admit that Lord Howe displayed the highest talent, it\r\nshould be added that he had in his hands excellent instruments.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of October the fleet and storeships drew nigh the Straits of\r\nGibraltar. On that day it was rejoined by a frigate, which forty-eight\r\nhours before had been sent ahead to communicate the approach of the\r\nrelief, and to concert action. She brought the cheering news of the\r\nvictorious repulse by the British of the grand attack by sea and land\r\nupon September 13th, with the entire destruction of the trusted floating\r\nbatteries. Under this flush of national triumph, and with a fair\r\nwesterly wind, the great expedition entered the straits on October 11th,\r\nin ranged order for action. The convoy went first, because, sailing\r\nbefore the wind, it was thus to leeward of the ships of war, in position\r\nto be immediately defended, if attacked. Two squadrons of the fleet\r\nsucceeded them, in line-of-battle ahead, formed thus for instant\r\nengagement, Howe leading in the _Victory_; while the third of the\r\nsquadrons followed in reserve, in an order not stated, but probably in a\r\nline abreast, sweeping a broader belt of sea, and more nearly under the\r\neye of the Commander-in-chief, who, for the purposes of the present\r\noperation, had left his traditional post in the centre. Howe's reasons\r\nfor this change of position, if ever stated, have not come under the\r\neyes of the writer; but analysis shows that he was there close to the\r\nstoreships, whose safe entrance to the port was at once the main object\r\nof the enterprise and the one most critically uncertain of achievement,\r\nbecause of the general bad behavior of convoys. There he could control\r\nthem more surely, and at the same time by his own conduct indicate his\r\ngeneral purposes to subordinates, who, however deficient in distinctly\r\ntactical proficiency, had the seamanship and the willingness adequately\r\nto support him.\r\n\r\nAt 6 P.M. the supply ships were off the mouth of the bay, with the wind\r\nfair for their anchorage; but, although full and particular instructions\r\nhad been issued to them concerning currents and other local conditions,\r\nall save four missed the entrance and were swept to the eastward of the\r\nRock. The fleet of course had to follow its charge, and by their failure\r\na new task confronted Howe's professional abilities and endurance.\r\nFortunately he had an able adviser in the captain of the fleet, who had\r\nhad long experience of the locality, invaluable during the trying week\r\nthat ensued. The allies had not yet stirred. To move near fifty\r\nsail-of-the-line in pursuit of an enemy, inferior indeed, but ranged for\r\nbattle, and the precise moment of whose appearance could not have been\r\nforeseen, was no slight undertaking, as Nelson afterwards said. It may\r\nbe recalled that before Trafalgar over twenty-four hours were needed for\r\nthe allied thirty-three to get out of Cadiz Bay. On the 13th, however,\r\nthe combined French and Spaniards sailed, intent primarily, it would\r\nseem, not on the true and vital offensive purpose of frustrating the\r\nrelief, but upon the very secondary defensive object of preserving two\r\nof their own numbers, which in a recent gale had been swept to the\r\neastward. Thus trivially preoccupied, they practically neglected Howe,\r\nwho on his part stripped for action by sending the supply vessels to the\r\nZaffarine Islands, where the vagarious instincts of their captains would\r\nbe controlled by an anchor on the bottom. On the 14th the allies bore\r\nnorth from the British, close under the Spanish coast, and visible only\r\nfrom the mastheads. On the 15th the wind came east, and the convoy and\r\nfleet began cautiously to move towards Gibraltar, the enemy apparently\r\nout of sight, and certainly to the eastward. On the evening of the 16th\r\neighteen supply ships were at the mole, and on the 18th all had arrived.\r\nGibraltar was equipped for another year's endurance.\r\n\r\nWe have less than could be wished of particulars touching this\r\nperformance of Howe's, from the day of leaving England to that of\r\nfulfilment, five full weeks later. Inference and comment has to be built\r\nup upon incidents transmitted disconnectedly, interpreted in connection\r\nwith the usual known conditions and the relative strength of the two\r\nopposing parties. To professional understanding, thus far supplemented,\r\nmuch is clear; quite enough, at the least, to avouch the deliberation,\r\nthe steadiness, the professional aptitude, the unremitting exertion that\r\nso well supplies the place of celerity,--never resting, if never\r\nhasting,--the calculated daring at fit moments, and above all the\r\nunfailing self-possession and self-reliance which at every instant up\r\nto the last secured to the British enterprise the full value of the\r\nother qualities possessed by the Commander-in-chief. A biographical\r\nnotice of Howe cannot be complete without quoting the tribute of an\r\naccomplished officer belonging to one of the navies then arrayed against\r\nhim. \"The qualities displayed by Lord Howe during this short campaign,\"\r\nsays Captain Chevalier of the French service, \"rose to the full height\r\nof the mission which he had to fulfil. This operation, one of the finest\r\nin the War of American Independence, merits a praise equal to that of a\r\nvictory. If the English fleet was favored by circumstances,--and it is\r\nrare that in such enterprises one can succeed without the aid of\r\nfortune,--it was above all the Commander-in-chief's quickness of\r\nperception, the accuracy of his judgment, and the rapidity of his\r\ndecisions that assured success.\"\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished his main object and landed besides fifteen hundred\r\nbarrels of powder from his own ships, Howe tarried no longer. Like\r\nNelson, at Gibraltar on his way to St. Vincent, he would not trifle with\r\nan easterly wind, without which he could not leave the Straits against\r\nthe constant inset; neither would he adventure action, against a force\r\nsuperior by a third, amid the currents that had caused him so trying an\r\nexperience. There was, moreover, the important strategic consideration\r\nthat if the allied fleets, which were again in sight, followed him out,\r\nthey would thereby be drawn from any possible molestation of the\r\nunloading of the supply ships, which had been attempted, though with no\r\ngreat success, on the occasion of the relief by Darby, in 1781. Howe\r\ntherefore at once headed for the Atlantic. The allies pursued, and\r\nengaged partially on the afternoon and evening of October 20th; but the\r\nattack was not pushed home, although they had the advantage of the wind\r\nand of numbers. On the 14th of November the British fleet regained\r\nSpithead. It may be remarked that Admirals Barrington and Millbank both\r\npraised their captains very highly, for the maintenance of the order in\r\ntheir respective divisions during this action; the former saying it \"was\r\nthe finest close connected line I ever saw during my service at sea.\"\r\nHowe, who held higher ideals, conceived through earnest and prolonged\r\nstudy and reflection, was less well satisfied. It seems, however,\r\nreasonable to infer that the assiduity of his efforts to promote\r\ntactical precision had realized at least a partial measure of success.\r\n\r\nAnother long term of shore life now intervened, carrying the gallant\r\nadmiral over the change-fraught years of failing powers from fifty-six\r\nto sixty-seven, at which age he was again called into service, in the\r\ncourse of which he was to perform the most celebrated, but, it may\r\nconfidently be affirmed, not the most substantial, nor even the most\r\nbrilliant, action of his career. During much of this intermediate\r\nperiod, between 1783 and 1788, Howe occupied the Cabinet position of\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty, the civil head and administrator of the\r\nNavy. Into the discharge of this office he carried the same qualities of\r\nassiduous attention to duty, and of close devotion to details of\r\nprofessional progress, which characterized him when afloat; but, while\r\nfar from devoid of importance, there is but little in this part of his\r\nstory that needs mention as distinctive. Perhaps the most interesting\r\nincidents, seen in the light of afterwards, are that one of his earliest\r\nappointments to a ship was given to Nelson; and that the cordiality of\r\nhis reception at the end of the cruise is said to have removed from the\r\nhero an incipient but very strong disgust for the service. \"You ask me,\"\r\nwrote the future admiral to his brother, \"by what interest did I get a\r\nship? I answer, having served with credit was my recommendation to Lord\r\nHowe. Anything in reason that I can ask, I am sure of obtaining from his\r\njustice.\"\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the French Revolution, Howe stood conspicuously at\r\nthe head of the navy, distinguished at once for well-known professional\r\naccomplishments and for tried capacity in chief command. His rivals in\r\nrenown among his contemporaries--Keppel, Barrington, and Rodney--had\r\ngone to their rest. Jervis, Duncan, Nelson, Collingwood, and their\r\ncompeers, had yet to show what was in them as general officers. Lord\r\nHood alone remained; and he, although he had done deeds of great\r\npromise, had come to the front too late in the previous war for his\r\nreputation to rest upon sustained achievement as well as upon hopeful\r\nindication. The great commands were given to these two: Hood, the\r\njunior, going to the Mediterranean with twenty ships-of-the-line, Howe\r\ntaking the Channel Fleet of somewhat superior numbers.\r\n\r\nThe solid, deliberate, methodical qualities of the veteran admiral were\r\nbetter adapted to the more purely defensive rôle, forced upon Great\r\nBritain by the allied superiority in 1782, than to the continuous,\r\nvigilant, aggressive action demanded by the new conditions with which he\r\nnow had to deal, when the great conflagration of the Revolution was to\r\nbe hemmed in and stamped out by the unyielding pressure and massive\r\nblows of the British sea power. The days of regulated, routine\r\nhostilities between rulers had passed away with the uprising of a\r\npeople; the time foretold, when nation should rise against nation, was\r\nsuddenly come with the crash of an ancient kingdom and of its social\r\norder. An admirable organizer and indefatigable driller of ships, though\r\napparently a poor disciplinarian, Howe lacked the breadth of view, the\r\nclear intuitions, the alacrity of mind, brought to bear upon the problem\r\nby Jervis and Nelson, who, thus inspired, framed the sagacious plan to\r\nwhich, more than to any other one cause, was due the exhaustion alike\r\nof the Revolutionary fury and of Napoleon's imperial power. Keenly\r\ninterested in the material efficiency of his ships, as well as in the\r\nprecision with which they could perform necessary evolutions and\r\nmaintain prescribed formations, he sought to attain these ends by long\r\nstays in port, varied by formal cruises devoted to secondary objects and\r\nto fleet tactics. For these reasons also he steadfastly refused to\r\ncountenance the system of close-watching the enemy's ports, by the\r\npresence before each of a British force adequate to check each movement\r\nat its beginning.\r\n\r\nThus nursing ships and men, Howe flattered himself he should insure the\r\nperfection of the instrument which should be his stay in the hour of\r\nbattle. Herein he ignored the fundamental truth, plainly perceived by\r\nhis successor, St. Vincent, that the effectiveness of a military\r\ninstrument consists more in the method of its use, and in the practised\r\nskill of the human element that wields it, than in the material\r\nperfection of the weapon itself. It may justly be urged on his behalf\r\nthat the preparation he sought should have been made, but was not, by\r\nthe Government in the long years of peace. This is true; but yet the\r\nfact remains that he pursued his system by choice and conviction\r\nrepeatedly affirmed; that continuous instead of occasional cruising in\r\nthe proper positions would better have reached the ends of drill; and\r\nthat to the material well being of his ships he sacrificed those correct\r\nmilitary dispositions before the enemy's ports, instituted and\r\nmaintained by Hawke, and further developed and extended by Jervis, who\r\nat the same time preserved the efficiency of the vessels by increased\r\nenergy and careful prevision of their wants. The brilliant victory of\r\nthe 1st of June has obscured the accompanying fact, that lamentable\r\nfailure characterized the general strategic use of the Channel Fleet\r\nunder Howe and his immediate successor.\r\n\r\nOnce in sight of the enemy, however, the old man regained the fire of\r\nyouth, and showed the attainments which long study and careful thought\r\nhad added to his natural talent for war, enabling him to introduce\r\ndistinct advances upon the tactical conceptions of his predecessors. The\r\nbattle of June 1, 1794, was brought about in the following manner.\r\nPolitical anarchy and a bad season had combined to ruin the French\r\nharvests in 1793, and actual famine threatened the land. To obviate\r\nthis, at least partially, the Government had bought in the United States\r\na large quantity of breadstuffs, which were expected to arrive in May or\r\nJune, borne by one hundred and eighty merchant vessels. To insure the\r\nsafety of this valuable convoy, the Brest Fleet was sent to meet it at a\r\ndesignated point; five ships going first, and twenty-five following a\r\nfew days later. Robespierre's orders to the admiral, Villaret-Joyeuse,\r\nwere to avoid battle, if possible, but at all hazards to secure the\r\nmerchant fleet, or his head would answer for it.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, Howe, who had kept his vessels in port during the\r\nwinter, sailed from the Channel with thirty-two ships-of-the-line. These\r\nhe soon divided into two squadrons; one of which, numbering six, after\r\nperforming a specific service, was not ordered to rejoin the main body,\r\nbut to cruise in a different spot. These ships were sadly missed on the\r\nday of battle, when they could have changed a brilliant into a crushing\r\nvictory. Howe himself went to seek the French, instead of taking a\r\nposition where they must pass; and after some running to and fro, in\r\nwhich the British actually got to the westward of their foes, and might\r\nwell have missed them altogether, he was lucky enough, on the 28th of\r\nMay, some four hundred miles west of the island of Ushant, to find the\r\nlarger of their two detachments. This having been meanwhile joined by\r\none ship from the smaller, both opponents now numbered twenty-six heavy\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nThe French were to windward, a position which gives the power of\r\nrefusing or delaying decisive action. The average speed of any fleet,\r\nhowever, must fall below the best of some of the force opposed to it;\r\nand Howe, wishing to compel battle, sent out six of his fastest and\r\nhandiest ships. These were directed to concentrate their fire upon the\r\nenemy's rear, which, from the point of view of naval tactics, was the\r\nweakest part of a line-of-battle of sailing ships; because, to aid it,\r\nvessels ahead must turn round and change their formation, performing a\r\nregular evolution, whereas, if the van be assailed, the rear naturally\r\nadvances to its help. If this partial attack crippled one or more of the\r\nFrench, the disabled ships would drift towards the British, where either\r\nthey would be captured, or their comrades would be obliged to come to\r\ntheir rescue, hazarding the general engagement that Howe wanted. As it\r\nhappened, the French had in the rear an immense ship of one hundred and\r\nten guns, which beat off in detail the successive attacks of her smaller\r\nantagonists; but in so doing she received so much injury that she left\r\nthe fleet after nightfall, passing the British unmolested, and went back\r\nto Brest. One of her assailants, also, had to return to England; but, as\r\nthe relative force of the units thus clipped from the respective\r\nopponents was as three to two, the general result was a distinct\r\nmaterial gain for Howe. It is to be scored to his credit as a tactician\r\nthat he let this single enemy go, rather than scatter his fleet and lose\r\nground in trying to take her. He had a more important object.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, May 29th, the French by poor seamanship had lost to\r\nleeward, and were consequently somewhat nearer. Both fleets were heading\r\nsoutheasterly, with the wind at south-southwest; both, consequently, on\r\nthe starboard tack. Howe saw that, by tacking in succession, his column\r\nwould so head that several of his vessels in passing could bring the\r\nhostile rear under their guns, and that it was even possible that three\r\nor four might be cut off, unless reinforced; to attempt which by the\r\nenemy would involve also tactical possibilities favorable to the\r\nBritish. The necessary movement was ordered; and the French admiral,\r\nseeing things in the same light, was justly so alarmed for the result\r\nthat he turned his head ships, and after them his whole column in\r\nsuccession, to run down to help the rear. Judicious, and indeed\r\nnecessary, as this was, it played right into Howe's hands, and was a\r\ntribute to his tactical skill, by which it was compelled; for in doing\r\nthis the French necessarily gave up much of their distance to windward,\r\nand so hastened the collision they wished to avoid. Although the attack\r\nupon their rear was limited to a few desultory broadsides, the two\r\nfleets were at last nearly within cannon shot, whereas the day before\r\nthey had been eight or ten miles apart. Both were now on the port tack,\r\nrunning west in parallel lines.\r\n\r\nTowards noon, Howe saw that the morning's opportunity of directing his\r\nwhole column upon the enemy's rear again offered, but with a far better\r\nchance; that if his ships manoeuvred well half a dozen of the French\r\nmust be cut off, unless their admiral, to save them, repeated his\r\nprevious manoeuvre of running down to their assistance, which would\r\ninfallibly entail the general engagement sought by the British. The\r\nsignal to tack in succession was again made, and to pass through the\r\nenemy's line; but here Howe's purpose was foiled, as Rodney's on April\r\n17th, by the failure of his leading vessel. Her captain, like Carkett,\r\nwas of considerable seniority, having commanded a ship-of-the-line under\r\nHowe at New York, in 1778. His conduct during this brief campaign was so\r\nunfavorably noticed by his admiral that he asked a Court-Martial, which\r\ndismissed him from his ship, though clearing him of cowardice. Upon the\r\npresent occasion he for some time delayed obedience; and, when he did go\r\nabout, wore instead of tacking, which lost ground and caused confusion\r\nby going to leeward. The second ship acted well, and struck the French\r\ncolumn some distance from its rear, proving Howe right in judging that\r\nthe enemy's order could there be pierced. As this vessel was not closely\r\nsupported, she received such injuries from successive fires, that, when\r\nshe at last found an opening through which to pass, she was unable to\r\nmanoeuvre.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the van was failing him, Howe, whose flag-ship, the _Queen\r\nCharlotte_, was tenth from the head of his column, now took the lead\r\nhimself, tacked his own vessel, though her turn was not yet come, and,\r\naccompanied by his next ahead and astern,--another striking instance of\r\nthe inspiring influence of a high example,--stood straight for the\r\nhostile order. The three broke through astern of the sixth ship from the\r\nFrench rear, and cut off two of the enemy, which were speedily\r\nsurrounded by others of the British. Villaret-Joyeuse then repeated his\r\nformer evolution, and nothing could have saved a general engagement\r\nexcept the disorder into which the British had fallen, and Howe's\r\nmethodical abhorrence of attacks made in such confusion as prevailed.\r\nMoreover, the decisive result of this last brush was that the French\r\nentirely lost the windward position, and the British admiral knew that\r\nhe now had them where they could not escape; he could afford to postpone\r\nthe issue. Accordingly, fighting ceased for the day; but the French had\r\nbeen so mauled that three more ships had to go into port, leaving them\r\nbut twenty-two to the enemy's twenty-five.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate Howe's personal merit as a tactician, reflection should be\r\nbestowed upon the particulars of his conduct on these two days, with\r\nwhich the First of June is not to be compared; for in them culminated,\r\nso to speak, a long course of preparation in the study of tactical\r\npossibilities, and of the system of signals needed to insure necessary\r\nevolutions. His officers, as a body, do not appear to have deserved by\r\ntheir manoeuvring the encomium passed by Rodney upon his, during the\r\nlong chase to windward in May, 1780; and, as Howe had now held command\r\nfor a year, this failure may probably be assigned to lack of that\r\npunctilious severity to which Rodney attributed his own success. But in\r\nthe matter of personal acquirement Howe shows a distinct advance upon\r\nRodney's ideas and methods. There is not to be noted in Rodney's actions\r\nany foreshadowing of the judicious attack upon the enemy's rear, on May\r\n28th, by a smart flying squadron. This doubtless presents some analogy\r\nto a general chase, but there is in it more of system and of regulated\r\naction; in short, there is development. Again, although Rodney doubtless\r\ntacked in succession repeatedly, between May 9th and May 20th, in his\r\nefforts to reach the enemy to windward, there does not then appear, nor\r\ndid there appear on either of the two occasions when he succeeded in\r\nstriking their column from to leeward, any intention, such as Howe on\r\nthe 29th communicated by signal and enforced by action, of breaking\r\nthrough the enemy's line even at the cost of breaking his own. Not even\r\non April 12th had Rodney, as far as appears, any such formulated plan.\r\nThere is here, therefore, distinct progress, in the nature of reflective\r\nand reasoned development; for it is scarcely to be supposed that Howe's\r\nassiduity and close contact with the navy had failed to note, for future\r\napplication, the incidents of Rodney's battles, which had been the\r\nsubject of animated discussion and censure by eye-witnesses.\r\n\r\nIt will be recognized that the conception in Howe's mind, maintained\r\nunchangeably and carried consistently into effect during these two days,\r\nwas to attack continually, as opportunity offered, the rear end of the\r\nenemy's column, which corresponds precisely with the attack upon the\r\nflank of a line of battle on shore. Merit does not depend upon result,\r\nbut fortunate result should be noted for the encouragement and guidance\r\nof the future. In consequence of these sustained and judiciously\r\ndirected movements, and of the steps found necessary by the French\r\nadmiral because of injuries received, the enemy had lost from their line\r\nfour ships, of which one was of one hundred and twenty guns, another of\r\neighty; while of those retained one had lost all her spars save the\r\nlower masts, and had thenceforth to be towed in action. Against this was\r\nto be set only one British seventy-four, disabled on the 28th and\r\nreturned to port; their other damaged vessels refitted at sea and stayed\r\nwith the fleet. On the other hand, Howe's separated division of six\r\nremained separated, whereas four fresh French ships joined their main\r\nfleet on the 30th. Admirable tactics were thus neutralized by defective\r\nstrategy; and therefore it may with substantial accuracy be said that\r\nHowe's professional qualities and defects were both signally illustrated\r\nin this, his last conspicuous service.\r\n\r\nThe French admiral on the evening of the 29th saw that he now must\r\nfight, and at a disadvantage; consequently, he could not hope to protect\r\nthe convoy. As to save this was his prime object, the next best thing\r\nwas to entice the British out of its path. With this view he stood away\r\nto the northwest; while a dense fog coming on both favored his design\r\nand prevented further encounter during the two ensuing days, throughout\r\nwhich Howe continued to pursue. In the evening of May 31st the weather\r\ncleared, and at daybreak the next morning the enemies were in position,\r\nready for battle, two long columns of ships, heading west, the British\r\ntwenty-five, the French again twenty-six through the junction of the\r\nfour vessels mentioned. Howe now had cause to regret his absent six, and\r\nto ponder Nelson's wise saying, \"Only numbers can annihilate.\"\r\n\r\nThe time for manoeuvring was past. Able tactician as he personally was,\r\nand admirable as had been the direction of his efforts in the two days'\r\nfighting, Howe had been forced in them to realize two things, namely,\r\nthat his captains were, singly, superior in seamanship, and their crews\r\nin gunnery, to the French; and again, that in the ability to work\r\ntogether as a fleet the British were so deficient as to promise very\r\nimperfect results, if he attempted any but the simplest formation. To\r\nsuch, therefore, he resorted; falling back upon the old, unskilful,\r\nsledge-hammer fashion of the British navy. Arranging his ships in one\r\nlong line, three miles from the enemy, he made them all go down\r\ntogether, each to attack a specified opponent, coming into action as\r\nnearly as might be at the same instant. Thus the French, from the\r\nindividual inferiority of the units of their fleet, would be at all\r\npoints overpowered. The issue justified the forecast; but the manner of\r\nperformance was curiously and happily marked by Howe's own peculiar\r\nphlegm. There was a long summer day ahead for fighting, and no need for\r\nhurry. The order was first accurately formed, and canvas reduced to\r\nproper proportions. Then the crews went to breakfast. After breakfast,\r\nthe ships all headed for the hostile line, under short sail, the admiral\r\nkeeping them in hand during the approach, as an infantry officer dresses\r\nhis company. Hence the shock from end to end was so nearly simultaneous\r\nas to induce success unequalled in any engagement conducted on the same\r\nprimitive plan.\r\n\r\nPicturesque as well as sublime, animating as well as solemn, on that\r\nbright Sunday morning, was this prelude to the stern game of war about\r\nto be played: the quiet summer sea stirred only by a breeze sufficient\r\nto cap with white the little waves that ruffled its surface; the dark\r\nhulls gently rippling the water aside in their slow advance, a ridge of\r\nfoam curling on either side of the furrow ploughed by them in their\r\nonward way; their massive sides broken by two, or at times three, rows\r\nof ports, whence, the tompions drawn, yawned the sullen lines of guns,\r\nbehind which, unseen, but easily realized by the instructed eye,\r\nclustered the groups of ready seamen who served each piece. Aloft swung\r\nleisurely to and fro the tall spars, which ordinarily, in so light a\r\nwind, would be clad in canvas from deck to truck, but whose naked\r\ntrimness now proclaimed the deadly purpose of that still approach. Upon\r\nthe high poops, where floated the standard of either nation, gathered\r\nround each chief the little knot of officers through whom commands were\r\nissued and reports received, the nerves along which thrilled the\r\nimpulses of the great organism, from its head, the admiral, through\r\nevery member to the dark lowest decks, nearly awash, where, as farthest\r\nfrom the captain's own oversight, the senior lieutenants controlled the\r\naction of the ships' heaviest batteries.\r\n\r\nOn board the _Queen Charlotte_, Lord Howe, whose burden of sixty-eight\r\nyears had for four days found no rest save what he could snatch in an\r\narm-chair, now, at the prospect of battle, \"displayed an animation,\"\r\nwrites an eye-witness, \"of which, at his age, and after such fatigue of\r\nbody and mind, I had not thought him capable. He seemed to contemplate\r\nthe result as one of unbounded satisfaction.\" By his side stood his\r\nfleet-captain, Curtis, of whose service among the floating batteries,\r\nand during the siege of Gibraltar, the governor of the fortress had\r\nsaid, \"He is the man to whom the king is chiefly indebted for its\r\nsecurity;\" and Codrington, then a lieutenant, who afterwards commanded\r\nthe allied fleets at Navarino. Five ships to the left, Collingwood, in\r\nthe _Barfleur_, was making to the admiral whose flag she bore the remark\r\nthat stirred Thackeray: \"Our wives are now about going to church, but\r\nwe will ring about these Frenchmen's ears a peal which will drown their\r\nbells.\" The French officers, both admirals and captains, were mainly\r\nunknown men, alike then and thereafter. The fierce flames of the\r\nRevolution had swept away the men of the old school, mostly aristocrats,\r\nand time had not yet brought forward the very few who during the\r\nNapoleonic period showed marked capacity. The commander-in-chief,\r\nVillaret-Joyeuse, had three years before been a lieutenant. He had a\r\nhigh record for gallantry, but was without antecedents as a general\r\nofficer. With him, on the poop of the _Montagne_, which took her name\r\nfrom Robespierre's political supporters, stood that anomalous companion\r\nof the generals and admirals of the day, the Revolutionary commissioner,\r\nJean Bon Saint-André, about to learn by experience the practical working\r\nof the system he had advocated, to disregard all tests of ability save\r\npatriotism and courage, depreciating practice and skill as unnecessary\r\nto the valor of the true Frenchman.\r\n\r\nAs the British line drew near the French, Howe said to Curtis, \"Prepare\r\nthe signal for close action.\" \"There is no such signal,\" replied Curtis.\r\n\"No,\" said the admiral, \"but there is one for closer action, and I only\r\nwant that to be made in case of captains not doing their duty.\" Then\r\nclosing a little signal book he always carried, he continued to those\r\naround him, \"Now, gentlemen, no more book, no more signals. I look to\r\nyou to do the duty of the _Queen Charlotte_ in engaging the flag-ship. I\r\ndon't want the ships to be bilge to bilge, but if you can lock the\r\nyardarms, so much the better; the battle will be the quicker decided.\"\r\nHis purpose was to go through the French line, and fight the _Montagne_\r\non the far side. Some doubted their succeeding, but Howe overbore them.\r\n\"That's right, my lord!\" cried Bowen, the sailing-master, who looked to\r\nthe ship's steering. \"The _Charlotte_ will make room for herself.\" She\r\npushed close under the French ship's stern, grazing her ensign, and\r\nraking her from stern to stem with a withering fire, beneath which fell\r\nthree hundred men. A length or two beyond lay the French _Jacobin_. Howe\r\nordered the _Charlotte_ to luff, and place herself between the two. \"If\r\nwe do,\" said Bowen, \"we shall be on board one of them.\" \"What is that to\r\nyou, sir?\" asked Howe quickly. \"Oh!\" muttered the master, not inaudibly.\r\n\"D----n my eyes if I care, if you don't. I'll go near enough to singe\r\nsome of our whiskers.\" And then, seeing by the _Jacobins_ rudder that\r\nshe was going off, he brought the _Charlotte_ sharp round, her jib boom\r\ngrazing the second Frenchman as her side had grazed the flag of the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment the battle raged furiously from end to end of the field\r\nfor nearly an hour,--a wild scene of smoke and confusion, under cover of\r\nwhich many a fierce ship duel was fought, while here and there men\r\nwandered, lost, in a maze of bewilderment that neutralized their better\r\njudgment. An English naval captain tells a service tradition of one who\r\nwas so busy watching the compass, to keep his position in the ranks,\r\nthat he lost sight of his antagonist, and never again found him. Many a\r\nquaint incident passed, recorded or unrecorded, under that sulphurous\r\ncanopy. A British ship, wholly dismasted, lay between two enemies, her\r\ncaptain desperately wounded. A murmur of surrender was somewhere heard;\r\nbut as the first lieutenant checked it with firm authority, a cock flew\r\nupon the stump of a mast and crowed lustily. The exultant note found\r\nquick response in hearts not given to despair, and a burst of merriment,\r\naccompanied with three cheers, replied to the bird's triumphant scream.\r\nOn board the _Brunswick_, in her struggle with the _Vengeur_, one of the\r\nlongest and fiercest fights the sea has ever seen, the cocked hat was\r\nshot off the effigy of the Duke of Brunswick, which she bore as a\r\nfigure-head. A deputation from the crew gravely requested the captain to\r\nallow the use of his spare chapeau, which was securely nailed on, and\r\nprotected his grace's wig during the rest of the action. After this\r\nbattle with the ships of the new republic, the partisans of monarchy\r\nnoted with satisfaction that, among the many royal figures that\r\nsurmounted the stems of the British fleet, not one lost his crown. Of a\r\nharum-scarum Irish captain are told two droll stories. After being\r\nhotly engaged for some time with a French ship, the fire of the latter\r\nslackened, and then ceased. He called to know if she had surrendered.\r\nThe reply was, \"No.\" \"Then,\" shouted he, \"d----n you, why don't you\r\nfire?\" Having disposed of his special antagonist without losing his own\r\nspars, the same man kept along in search of new adventures, until he\r\ncame to a British ship totally dismasted and otherwise badly damaged.\r\nShe was commanded by a captain of rigidly devout piety. \"Well, Jemmy,\"\r\nhailed the Irishman, \"you are pretty well mauled; but never mind, Jemmy,\r\nwhom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.\"\r\n\r\nThe French have transmitted to us less of anecdote, nor is it easy to\r\nconnect the thought of humor with those grimly earnest republicans and\r\nthe days of the Terror. There is, indeed, something unintentionally\r\nfunny in the remark of the commander of one of the captured ships to his\r\ncaptors. They had, it was true, dismasted half the French fleet, and had\r\ntaken over a fourth; yet he assured them it could not be considered a\r\nvictory, \"but merely a butchery, in which the British had shown neither\r\nscience nor tactics.\" The one story, noble and enduring, that will ever\r\nbe associated with the French on the 1st of June is in full keeping with\r\nthe temper of the times and the enthusiasm of the nation. The\r\nseventy-four-gun ship _Vengeur_, after a three hours' fight, yardarm to\r\nyardarm, with the British _Brunswick_, was left in a sinking state by\r\nher antagonist, who was herself in no condition to help. In the\r\nconfusion, the _Vengeur's_ peril was for some time not observed; and\r\nwhen it was, the British ships that came to her aid had time only to\r\nremove part of her survivors. In their report of the event the latter\r\nsaid: \"Scarcely had the boats pulled clear of the sides, when the most\r\nfrightful spectacle was offered to our gaze. Those of our comrades who\r\nremained on board the _Vengeur du Peuple_, with hands raised to heaven,\r\nimplored, with lamentable cries, the help for which they could no longer\r\nhope. Soon disappeared the ship and the unhappy victims it contained. In\r\nthe midst of the horror with which this scene inspired us all, we could\r\nnot avoid a feeling of admiration mingled with our grief. As we drew\r\naway, we heard some of our comrades still offering prayers for the\r\nwelfare of their country. The last cries of these unfortunates were,\r\n'Vive la République!' They died uttering them.\" Over a hundred Frenchmen\r\nthus went down.\r\n\r\nSeven French ships were captured, including the sunk _Vengeur_. Five\r\nmore were wholly dismasted, but escaped,--a good fortune mainly to be\r\nattributed to Howe's utter physical prostration, due to his advanced\r\nyears and the continuous strain of the past five days. He now went to\r\nbed, completely worn out. \"We all got round him,\" wrote an officer,\r\nLieutenant Codrington, who was present; \"indeed, I saved him from a\r\ntumble, he was so weak that from a roll of the ship he was nearly\r\nfalling into the waist. 'Why, you hold me up as if I were a child,' he\r\nsaid good-humoredly.\" Had he been younger, there can be little doubt\r\nthat the fruits of victory would have been gathered with an ardor which\r\nhis assistant, Curtis, failed to show. The fullest proof of this is the\r\nanecdote, already quoted in the sketch of Rodney,[13] which has been\r\ntransmitted by Admiral Sir Byam Martin direct from the sailing-master of\r\nthe _Queen Charlotte_, afterwards Admiral Bowen; but his account is\r\nabundantly confirmed by other officers, eye and ear witnesses. Taken in\r\nconnection with these, Codrington's story of his physical weakness bears\r\nthe note, not of pathos only, but of encouragement; for the whole\r\ntestifies assuredly to the persistence, through great bodily debility,\r\nof a strong quality diligently cultivated in the days of health and\r\nvigor. In truth, it was impossible for Howe to purpose otherwise. Having\r\nbeen continuously what he was in his prime, it could not be that he\r\nwould not intend, with all the force of his will, to persevere to the\r\nutmost in the duty before him. The faithfulness of a lifetime does not\r\nso forsake a man in his end. What he lacked in that critical hour was\r\nnot the willing mind, but the instrument by which to communicate to the\r\nfleet the impulse which his own failing powers were no longer able\r\ndirectly to impart.\r\n\r\nLord Howe's career practically ended with this battle and the honors\r\nthat followed it. Infirmities then gained rapidly upon him, and it would\r\nhave been well had his own wish to retire been granted by the\r\nGovernment. He remained in nominal command of the Channel Fleet, though\r\nnot going to sea, until the occurrence of the great mutinies of 1797.\r\nThe suppression--or, more properly, the composing--of this ominous\r\noutbreak was devolved upon him by the ministry. He very wisely observed\r\nthat \"preventive measures rather than corrective are to be preferred for\r\npreserving discipline in fleets and armies;\" but it was in truth his own\r\nfailure to use such timely remedies, owing to the lethargy of increasing\r\nyears, acting upon a temperament naturally indulgent and unapprehensive,\r\nthat was largely responsible for disorders of whose imminence he had\r\nwarning. From the military standpoint, the process of settlement had\r\nmuch the air of opéra bouffe,--a consummation probably inevitable when\r\njust grievances and undeniable hardships get no attention until the\r\nsufferers break through all rules, and seek redress by force. The\r\nmutinous seamen protested to Howe the bitterness of their sorrow at the\r\nsense of wrong doing, but in the same breath insisted that their demands\r\nmust be conceded, and that certain obnoxious officers must be removed\r\nfrom their ships. The demands were yielded, Howe gently explaining to\r\nthe men how naughty they had been; and that, as to the unpopular\r\nofficers, they themselves asked relief from so unpleasant a situation.\r\nIn his curiously involved style, he wrote: \"This request has been\r\ncomplied with, under the pretext of an equal desire on the part of the\r\nofficers not to be employed in ships where exception, without\r\nspecification of facts, has been taken to their conduct. However\r\nineligible the concession, it was become indispensably necessary.\" Under\r\nthis thin veil, men persuaded themselves that appearances were saved, as\r\na woman hides a smile behind her fan. Admiral Codrington, a firm admirer\r\nof Howe, justly said: \"It was want of discipline which led to the\r\ndiscontent and mutiny in the Channel Fleet. Lord Howe got rid of the\r\nmutiny by granting the men all they asked; but discipline was not\r\nrestored until the ships most remarkable for misconduct had been, one\r\nafter the other, placed under the command of Lord St. Vincent.\"\r\n\r\nWith the settlement of this mutiny Lord Howe's long career of active\r\nservice closed. Immediately afterwards he retired formally, as he\r\nsometime before had actually, from the command of the Channel Fleet, and\r\non the 5th of August, 1799, he died full of years and honors; having\r\nlived just long enough to welcome the rising star of Nelson's glory as\r\nit burst upon men's sight at Cape St. Vincent and the Nile.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] Parkman's \"Montcalm and Wolfe,\" vol. ii. p. 90.\r\n\r\n[13] _Ante_, p. 250.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERVIS\r\n\r\n1735-1823\r\n\r\n\r\nThe renown of Nelson is part of the heritage of the world. His deeds,\r\nalthough their full scope and real significance have been but little\r\nunderstood, stand out conspicuous among a host of lesser achievements,\r\nand are become to mankind the symbol of Great Britain's maritime power\r\nin that tremendous era when it drove the French Revolution back upon\r\nitself, stifling its excesses, and so insuring the survival of the\r\nbeneficent tendencies which for a time seemed well nigh lost in the\r\nmadness of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a prodigy like Nelson, however, is not an isolated\r\nevent, independent of antecedents. It is the result of a happy meeting\r\nof genius and opportunity. The hour has come, and the man. Other men\r\nhave labored, and the hero enters into their labors; not unjustly, for\r\nthereto he also has been appointed by those special gifts which fit him\r\nto reap as theirs fitted them to sow. In relation to Nelson and his\r\ncareer, the illustrious officer whose most distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics we have now to trace stood pre-eminent among many\r\nforerunners. It was he, above all others, who made the preparation\r\nindispensable to the approaching triumphal progress of the first of\r\nBritish naval heroes, so that his own work underlies that of his\r\nsuccessor, as foundation supports superstructure. There is not between\r\nthem the vital connection of root to branch, of plant to fruit. In the\r\nmatter of professional kinship Nelson has far more in common with Hood.\r\nBetween these there is an identity of kind, an orderly sequence of\r\ndevelopment, an organic bond, such as knits together the series of a\r\nprogressive evolution. It is not so with Jervis. Closely conjoined as\r\nthe two men long were in a common service, and in mutual admiration and\r\nsympathy, it would be an error to think of the elder as in any sense the\r\nprofessional progenitor of the younger; yet he was, as it were, an\r\nadoptive father, who from the first fostered, and to the last gloried\r\nin, the genius which he confessed unparalleled. \"It does not become me\r\nto make comparisons,\" he wrote after Copenhagen; \"all agree that there\r\nis but one Nelson.\" And when the great admiral had been ten years in his\r\ngrave, he said of an officer's gallant conduct at the Battle of Algiers,\r\n\"He seems to have felt Lord Nelson's eye upon him;\" as though no\r\nstronger motive could be felt nor higher praise given.\r\n\r\nJohn Jervis was born on the 20th of January, 1735, at Meaford, in\r\nStaffordshire. He was intended for his father's profession, the law;\r\nbut, by his own account, a disinclination which was probably natural\r\nbecame invincible through the advice of the family coachman. \"Don't be a\r\nlawyer, Master Jacky,\" said the old man; \"all lawyers are rogues.\"\r\nSometime later, his father receiving the appointment of auditor to\r\nGreenwich Hospital, the family removed to the neighborhood of London;\r\nand there young Jervis, being thrown in contact with ships and seamen,\r\nand particularly with a midshipman of his own age, became confirmed in\r\nhis wish to go to sea. Failing to get his parents' consent, he ran away\r\ntowards the close of the year 1747. From this escapade he was brought\r\nback; but his father, seeing the uselessness of forcing the lad's\r\ninclinations, finally acquiesced, though it seems likely, from his after\r\nconduct, that it was long before he became thoroughly reconciled to the\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1748, the future admiral and peer first went afloat in a\r\nship bound to the West Indies. The time was inauspicious for one making\r\nthe navy his profession. The war of the Austrian succession had just\r\nbeen brought to an end by the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, and the\r\nmonotonous discomfort of hard cruising, unrelieved by the excitements of\r\nbattle or the flush of prize-taking, was the sole prospect of one whose\r\nnarrow means debarred him from such pleasures as the station afforded\r\nand youth naturally prompted him to seek. His pay was little over twenty\r\npounds a year, and his father had not felt able to give more than that\r\nsum towards his original outfit. After being three years on board,\r\npractising a rigid economy scarcely to be expected in one of his years,\r\nthe lad of sixteen drew a bill upon home for twenty pounds more. It came\r\nback dishonored. The latent force of his character was at once aroused.\r\nTo discharge the debt, he disposed of his pay tickets at a heavy\r\ndiscount; sold his bed, and for three years slept on the deck; left the\r\nmess to which he belonged, living forward on the allowance of a seaman,\r\nand making, mending, and washing his own clothes, to save expense. Doubt\r\nhas been expressed as to the reality of these early privations, on the\r\nground that his father's office at Greenwich, and the subsequent\r\npromotions of the young officer, show the existence of a family\r\ninfluence, which would have counteracted such extreme restriction in\r\nmoney matters. The particulars, however, have been so transmitted as to\r\nentitle them to acceptance, unless contradicted by something more\r\npositive than circumstantial inference from other conditions, not\r\nnecessarily contradictory.\r\n\r\nThis sharp experience was singularly adapted to develop and exaggerate\r\nhis natural characteristics, self-reliance, self-control, stern\r\ndetermination, and, it must be added, the exacting harshness which\r\ndemanded of others all that he had himself accepted. His experience of\r\nsuffering and deprivation served, not to enlarge his indulgence, but to\r\nintensify his severity. Yet it may be remarked that Jervis was at all\r\nperiods in thorough touch with distinctively naval feeling, sympathizing\r\nwith and respecting its sensibilities, sharing its prejudices, as well\r\nas comprehending its weaknesses. Herein he differed from Rodney, who in\r\nthe matter of community of sentiment stood habitually external to his\r\nprofession; in it, but in heart not of it; belonging consciously and\r\nwillingly to a social class which cherished other ideals of life and\r\naction. His familiarity with the service quickened him to criticise more\r\nkeenly and accurately than a stranger, to recognize failings with\r\nharsher condemnation; but there appears no disposition to identify\r\nhimself with it further than as an instrument of personal advancement\r\nand distinction.\r\n\r\nUpon Jervis's naval future, the results of his early ordeal were wholly\r\ngood. Unable to pursue pleasure ashore, he stuck to sea-going ships; and\r\nthe energies of a singularly resolute mind were devoted to mastering all\r\nthe details of his profession. After six years in the Caribbean, he\r\nreturned to England in the autumn of 1754. The troubles between France\r\nand Great Britain which issued in the Seven Years War had already begun,\r\nand Jervis, whose merit commanded immediate recognition from those under\r\nwhom he served, found family influence to insure his speedy promotion\r\nand employment. Being made lieutenant early in 1755, he was with\r\nBoscawen off the Gulf of St. Lawrence when that admiral, although peace\r\nyet reigned, was ordered to seize the French fleet bearing\r\nreinforcements to Quebec. At the same time, Braddock's unfortunate\r\nexpedition was miscarrying in the forests of Pittsburg. A year later, in\r\n1756, Jervis went to the Mediterranean with Admiral Hawke, sent to\r\nrelieve Byng after the fiasco at Minorca which brought that unhappy\r\ncommander to trial and to death.\r\n\r\nBefore and during this Mediterranean cruise Jervis had been closely\r\nassociated with Sir Charles Saunders, one of the most distinguished\r\nadmirals of that generation, upon whom he made so favorable an\r\nimpression that he was chosen for first lieutenant of the flag-ship,\r\nwhen Saunders, in 1758, was named to command the fleet to act against\r\nQuebec. The gallant and romantic General Wolfe, whose death in the hour\r\nof victory saddened the triumph of the conquerors, embarked in the same\r\nship; and the long passage favored the growth of a close personal\r\nintimacy between the two young men, who had been at school together as\r\nboys, although the soldier was several years older than the sailor. The\r\nrelations thus formed and the confidences exchanged are shown by a\r\ntouching incident recorded by Jervis's biographer. On the night before\r\nthe battle on the Heights of Abraham, Wolfe went on board the\r\n_Porcupine_, a small sloop of war to whose command Jervis had meanwhile\r\nbeen promoted, and asked to see him in private. He then said that he was\r\nstrongly impressed with the feeling that he should fall on the morrow,\r\nand therefore wished to entrust to his friend the miniature of the lady,\r\nMiss Lowther, to whom he was engaged, and to have from him the promise\r\nthat, if the foreboding proved true, he would in person deliver to her\r\nboth the portrait and Wolfe's own last messages. From the interview the\r\nyoung general departed to achieve his enterprise, to which daring\r\naction, brilliant success, and heroic death have given a lustre that\r\ntime itself has not been able to dim, whose laurels remain green to our\r\nown day; while Jervis, to whose old age was reserved the glory that his\r\ncomrade reaped in youth, remained behind to discharge his last\r\nrequest,--a painful duty which, upon returning to England, was\r\nscrupulously fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAlthough the operations against Quebec depended wholly upon the control\r\nof the water by the navy, its influence, as often happens, was so\r\nquietly exerted as to draw no attention from the general eye, dazzled by\r\nthe conspicuous splendor of Wolfe's conduct. To Jervis had been assigned\r\nthe distinguished honor of leading the fleet with his little ship, in\r\nthe advance up river against the fortifications of the place; and it is\r\ninteresting to note that in this duty he was joined with the afterwards\r\ncelebrated explorer, James Cook, who, as master of the fleet, had\r\nspecial charge of the pilotage in those untried waters. Wolfe, Cook, and\r\nJervis form a striking trio of names, then unknown, yet closely\r\nassociated, afterwards to be widely though diversely renowned.\r\n\r\nWhen the city fell, Commander Jervis was sent to England, probably with\r\ndespatches. There he was at once given a ship, and ordered to return\r\nwith her to North America. Upon her proving leaky, he put in to\r\nPlymouth, where, as his mission was urgent, he was directed to take\r\ncharge of a sloop named the _Albany_, then lying at anchor near by, and\r\nto proceed in her. To this moment has been attributed an incident which,\r\nas regards time and place, has been more successfully impeached than the\r\nstory of his early privations, in that no mention of it is found in the\r\nship's log; and there are other discrepancies which need reconcilement.\r\nNevertheless it is, as told, so entirely characteristic, that the\r\npresent writer has no doubt it occurred, at some time, substantially as\r\ngiven by his biographer, who was son to a secretary long in close\r\nrelations with him when admiral. It would be entirely in keeping with\r\nall experience of testimony that the old man's recollections, or those\r\nof his secretary, may have gone astray on minor circumstances, while\r\npreserving accurately the fundamental and only really important facts,\r\nwhich are perfectly consistent with, and illustrative of, the stern\r\ndecision afterwards shown in meeting and suppressing mutiny of the most\r\nthreatening description. The crew of the _Albany_, it is said, from some\r\nmotives of discontent refused to sail. Jervis had brought with him a few\r\nseamen from his late command. These he ordered to cut the cables which\r\nheld the ship to her anchors, and to loose the foresail. Daunted more,\r\nperhaps, by the bearing of the man than by the mere acts, the mutineers\r\nsubmitted, and in twenty-four days, an extraordinarily short passage for\r\nthat time, the _Albany_ was at New York. Here Jervis was unfortunately\r\ndelayed, and thus, being prevented from rejoining Sir Charles Saunders,\r\nlost the promotion which a British commander-in-chief could then give to\r\nan officer in his own command who had merited his professional approval.\r\nIt was not until October, 1761, when he was twenty-six, that Jervis\r\nobtained \"post\" rank,--the rank, that is, of full, or post, captain. By\r\nthe rule of the British navy, an officer up to that rank could be\r\nadvanced by selection; thenceforth he waited, through the long\r\nsuccession of seniority, for his admiral's commission. This Jervis did\r\nnot receive until 1787, when he was fifty-two.\r\n\r\nIt was as a general officer, as an admiral commanding great fleets and\r\nbearing responsibilities unusually grave through a most critical period\r\nof his country's history, that Jervis made his high and deserved\r\nreputation. For this reason, the intervening years, though pregnant with\r\nthe finished character and distinguished capacity which fitted him for\r\nhis onerous work, and though by no means devoid of incident, must be\r\nhastily sketched. The Treaty of Paris, which in 1763 closed the Seven\r\nYears War, was followed by twelve years of peace. Then came the American\r\nRevolution, bringing in its train hostilities with France and Spain.\r\nDuring the peace, Jervis for nearly four years commanded a frigate in\r\nthe Mediterranean. It is told that while his ship was at Genoa two\r\nTurkish slaves escaped from a Genoese galley, and took refuge in a\r\nBritish boat lying at the mole, wrapping its flag round their persons.\r\nGenoese officers took them forcibly from the boat and restored them to\r\ntheir chains. Jervis resented this, as being not only an insult to the\r\nBritish flag, but also an enforcement of slavery against men under its\r\nprotection; and so peremptory was his tone that an apology was made, the\r\ntwo captives were given up on the frigate's quarter-deck, and the\r\noffending officers punished. The captain's action, however, was not\r\nsustained by his own government. It is curious to note that,\r\nnotwithstanding his course in this case, and although he was not merely\r\nnominally, but strenuously, a Whig, or Liberal, in political faith,\r\nconnected by party ties with Fox and his coterie of friends, Jervis was\r\nalways opposed to the abolition of the slave trade and to the education\r\nof the lower orders. Liberty was to him an inherited worship, associated\r\nwith certain stock beliefs and phrases, but subordination was the true\r\nidol of his soul.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 Captain Jervis commissioned the _Foudroyant_, of eighty-four\r\nguns, a ship captured in 1758 from the French, and thereafter thought to\r\nbe the finest vessel in the British fleet. To this, her natural\r\nsuperiority, Jervis added a degree of order, discipline, and drill which\r\nmade her the pride and admiration of the navy. He was forty when his\r\npennant first flew from her masthead, and he held the command for eight\r\nyears, a period covering the full prime of his own maturity, as well as\r\nthe entire course of the American Revolution. It was also a period\r\nmarked for him, professionally, less by distinguished service than by\r\nthat perfection of military organization, that combination of dignified\r\nyet not empty pomp with thorough and constant readiness, which was so\r\neminently characteristic of all the phases of Jervis's career, and\r\nwhich, when the rare moments came, was promptly transformed into\r\nunhesitating, decisive, and efficient action. The _Foudroyant_, in her\r\nstate and discipline, was the type in miniature of Jervis's\r\nMediterranean fleet, declared by Nelson to be the finest body of ships\r\nhe had ever known; nay, she was the precursor of that regenerate British\r\nnavy in which Nelson found the instruments of his triumphs. Sixty years\r\nlater, old officers recalled the feelings of mingled curiosity and awe\r\nwith which, when sent to her on duty from their own ships, they climbed\r\non board the _Foudroyant_, and from the larboard side of her\r\nquarter-deck gazed upon the stern captain, whose qualities were\r\nembodied in his vessel and constituted her chief excellences.\r\n\r\nDuring Jervis's command, the _Foudroyant_ was continuously attached to\r\nthe Channel Fleet, whose duty, as the name implies, was to protect the\r\nEnglish Channel and its approaches; a function which often carried the\r\nships far into the Bay of Biscay. Thus he took a prominent part in\r\nKeppel's battle off Ushant in 1778, in the movements occasioned by the\r\nentrance into the Channel of an overpowering Franco-Spanish fleet in\r\n1779 and 1781, and in the brilliant relief of Gibraltar by Admiral Howe\r\ntowards the end of 1782. His most distinguished service, however, was\r\ntaking, single-handed, the French seventy-four _Pégase_, in the spring\r\nof the latter year. The capture was effected after an action of fifty\r\nminutes, preceded by a chase of twelve hours, running before a half-gale\r\nof wind. The _Foudroyant_ was unquestionably superior in battery to her\r\nenemy, who, moreover, had but recently been commissioned; but, as has\r\njustly been remarked of some of the victories of our own ships over\r\nthose of the British in the War of 1812, although there was disparity of\r\nforces, the precision and rapidity with which the work was done bore\r\nincontrovertible testimony to the skill and training of the captain and\r\ncrew. Single combats, such as this, were rare between vessels of the\r\nsize of the _Foudroyant_ and _Pégase_, built to sail and fight in\r\nfleets. That one occurred here was due to the fact that the speed of\r\nthe two opponents left the British squadron far astern. The exploit\r\nobtained for Jervis a baronetcy and the ribbon of the Order of the Bath.\r\n\r\nSir John Jervis did not serve afloat during the ten years of peace\r\nfollowing 1783, although, from his high repute, he was one of those\r\nsummoned upon each of the alarms of war that from time to time arose.\r\nThroughout this period he sat in Parliament, voting steadily with his\r\nparty, the Whigs, and supporting Fox in his opposition to measures which\r\nseemed to tend towards hostilities with France. When war came, however,\r\nhe left his seat, ready to aid his country with his sword in the quarrel\r\nfrom which he had sought to keep her.\r\n\r\nHaving in the mean time risen from the rank of captain to that of\r\nrear-and of vice-admiral, Jervis's first service, in 1794, was in the\r\nCaribbean Sea, as commander of the naval part of a joint expedition of\r\narmy and navy to subdue the French West India islands. The operation,\r\nalthough most important and full of exciting and picturesque incident,\r\nbears but a small share in his career, and therefore may not be dwelt\r\nupon in so short a sketch as the present aims to be. Attended at first\r\nby marked and general success, it ended with some severe reverses,\r\noccasioned by the force given him being less than he demanded, and than\r\nthe extent of the work to be done required. A quaintly characteristic\r\nstory is told of the admiral's treatment of a lieutenant who at this\r\nperiod sought employment on board his ship. Knowing that he stood high\r\nin the old seaman's favor, the applicant confidently expected his\r\nappointment, but, upon opening the \"letter on service,\" was stunned to\r\nread:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     SIR,--You, having thought fit to take to yourself a\r\n     wife, are to look for no further attentions from\r\n\r\n     Your humble servant,\r\n     J. JERVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe supposed culprit, guiltless even in thought of this novel\r\nmisdemeanor, hastened on board, and explained that he abhorred such an\r\noffence as much as could the admiral. It then appeared that the letter\r\nhad been sent to the wrong person. Jervis was himself married at this\r\ntime; but his well-regulated affections had run steadily in harness\r\nuntil the mature age of forty-eight, and he saw no reason why other men\r\nshould depart from so sound a precedent. \"When an officer marries,\" he\r\ntersely said, \"he is d----d for the service.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to England in February, 1795, Jervis was in August nominated\r\nto command the Mediterranean station, and in November sailed to take up\r\nhis new duties. At the end of the month, in San Fiorenzo Bay, an\r\nanchorage in the north of Corsica, he joined the fleet, which continued\r\nunder his flag until June, 1799. He had now reached the highest rank in\r\nhis profession, though not the highest grade of that rank as it was\r\nthen subdivided; being a full Admiral of the Blue. The crowning period\r\nof his career here began. Admirable and striking as had been his\r\nprevious services, dignified and weighty as were the responsibilities\r\nborne by him in the later part of a life prolonged far beyond the span\r\nof man, the four years of Jervis's Mediterranean command stand\r\nconspicuous as the time when preparation flowered into achievement,\r\nsolid, durable, and brilliant. It may be interesting to Americans to\r\nrecall that his age was nearly the same as that of Farragut when the\r\nlatter assumed the charge in which, after long years of obscure\r\npreparation, he also reaped his harvest of glory. It is likewise worthy\r\nof note that this happy selection was made wholly independent of the\r\npolitical bias, which till then had so often and unworthily controlled\r\nnaval appointments. Jervis belonged to the small remnant of Whigs who\r\nstill followed Fox and inveighed against the current war, as unnecessary\r\nand impolitic. It was a pure service choice, as such creditable alike to\r\nthe Government and the officer.\r\n\r\nThough distinguished success now awaited him, a period of patient\r\neffort, endurance, and disappointment had first to be passed,\r\nreproducing in miniature the longer years of faithful service preceding\r\nhis professional triumphs. Jervis came to the Mediterranean too late for\r\nthe best interests of England. The year 1795, just ending, was one in\r\nwhich the energies of France, after the fierce rush of the Terror, had\r\nflagged almost to collapse. Not only so, but in its course the republic,\r\ndiscouraged by frequent failure, had decided to abandon the control of\r\nthe sea to its enemy, to keep its great fleets in port, and to confine\r\nits efforts to the harassment of British commerce. To this change of\r\npolicy in France is chiefly to be ascribed the failure of naval\r\nachievement with which Macaulay has reproached Pitt's earlier ministry.\r\nBattles cannot be fought if the foe keeps behind his walls. Prior to\r\nthis decision, two fleet battles had been fought in the Mediterranean in\r\nthe spring and summer of 1795, in which the British had missed great\r\nsuccesses only through the sluggishness of their admiral. \"To say how\r\nmuch we wanted Lord Hood\" (the last commander-in-chief), wrote Nelson,\r\n\"is to ask, 'Will you have all the French fleet or no battle?'\" Could he\r\nhave foreseen all that Jervis was to be to the Mediterranean, his\r\ndistress must have been doubled to know that the fortunes of the nation\r\nthus fell between two stools.\r\n\r\nHis predecessor's slackness in pushing military opportunities, due\r\npartly to ill health, was mainly constitutional, and therefore could not\r\nbut show itself by tangible evidences in the more purely administrative\r\nand disciplinary work. Jervis found himself at once under the necessity\r\nof bringing his fleet--in equipment, in discipline, and in\r\ndrill--sharply up to that level of efficiency which is essential to the\r\nfull development of power when occasion offers. This his perfect\r\nachievement, of organization and administration, in its many intricate\r\ndetails, needs at least to be clearly noted, even though space do not\r\nadmit many particulars; because his capacity as administrator at the\r\nhead of the Admiralty a few years later has been seriously impugned, by\r\na criticism both partial and excessive, if not wholly unjust. Nelson, a\r\nwitness of his Mediterranean service from beginning to end, lauded to\r\nthe utmost the excellence there reached, and attributed most of the\r\nshort-coming noted in the later office to the yielding of a man then\r\nadvanced in years, to advisers, in trusting whom fully he might well\r\nbelieve himself warranted by experience.\r\n\r\nAlthough, when taking command, his fleet reached the seemingly large\r\nproportions of twenty-five ships-of-the-line and some fifty cruisers,\r\nheavy allowance must be made for the variety of services extending over\r\nthe two thousand miles of the Mediterranean, from east to west. Seven\r\nof-the-line had to be kept before Cadiz, though still a neutral port, to\r\ncheck a French division within. One of the same class was on the Riviera\r\nwith Nelson; and other demands, with the necessities of occasional\r\nabsences for refit, prevented the admiral from ever assembling before\r\nToulon, his great strategic care, much more than a round dozen to watch\r\nequal French numbers there. The protection of Corsica, then in British\r\nhands; the convoy of commerce, dispersed throughout the station; the\r\nassurance of communications to the fortress and Straits of Gibraltar, by\r\nwhich all transit to and from the Mediterranean passes; diplomatic\r\nexigencies with the various littoral states of the inland sea; these\r\ndivergent calls, with the coincident necessity of maintaining every ship\r\nin fit condition for action, show the extent of the administrative work\r\nand of the attendant correspondence. The evidence of many eye-witnesses\r\nattests the successful results.\r\n\r\nSimilar attention, broad yet minute, was demanded for the more onerous\r\nand invidious task of enforcing relaxed discipline and drill. Concerning\r\nthese, the most pregnant testimony, alike to the stringency and the\r\npersistence of his measures, may be found in the imbittered expressions\r\nof enemies. Five years later, when the rumor spread that he was to have\r\nthe Channel Fleet, the toast was drunk at the table of the man then in\r\ncommand, \"May the discipline of the Mediterranean never be introduced\r\ninto the Channel.\" \"May his next glass of wine choke the wretch,\" is a\r\nspeech attributed to a captain's wife, wrathful that her husband was\r\nkept from her side by the admiral's regulations. For Jervis's discipline\r\nbegan at the top, with the division and ship commanders. One of the\r\nsenior admirals under him persisting in a remonstrance, beyond the point\r\nwhich he considered consistent with discipline, was sent home. \"The very\r\ndisorderly state of His Majesty's ship under your command,\" he writes to\r\na captain, \"obliges me to require that neither yourself nor any of your\r\nofficers are to go on shore on what is called pleasure.\" \"The\r\ncommander-in-chief finds himself under the painful necessity of publicly\r\nreprimanding Captains ---- and ---- for neglect of duty, in not\r\nmaintaining the stations assigned to their ships during the last night.\"\r\nIn a letter to a lieutenant he says, \"If you do not immediately make a\r\nsuitable apology to Commissioner Inglefield for the abominable neglect\r\nand disrespect you have treated him with, I will represent your\r\nbehaviour to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and recommend\r\nyour name to be struck off the list of lieutenants.\" Captains of vessels\r\nwere not only subject to strict regulation as to their personal\r\nproceedings, compelled to sleep on board, for instance, even in home\r\nports; but duties customarily left to subordinates, with results to\r\ndiscipline that might not now obtain but which were in those days\r\ndeplorable, were also assigned to them.\r\n\r\n\"The commander-in-chief has too exalted an opinion of the respective\r\ncaptains of the squadron to doubt their being upon deck when the signal\r\nis made to tack or wear _in the night_, and he requires all lieutenants\r\nthen to be at their stations, except those who had the watch\r\nimmediately preceding.\" Nor did he leave this delicately worded, but\r\npointed, admonition, issued in the Mediterranean, to take care of\r\nitself. In after years, when he was nigh seventy, his secretary tells\r\nthat on a cold and rainy November night off Brest, the signal to tack\r\nbeing made, he hurried to the cabin to persuade the old man not to go on\r\ndeck, as was his custom. He was not, however, in his cot, nor could he\r\nfor a long time be found; but at last a look into the stern gallery\r\ndiscovered him, in flannel dressing-gown and cocked hat, watching the\r\nmovements of the fleet. To remonstrance he replied, \"Hush, I want to see\r\nhow the evolution is performed on such a night, and to know whether\r\nJemmy Vashon (commanding the ship next astern) is on deck;\" but soon\r\nhearing the captain's well-known shrill voice, crying, \"Are you all\r\nready forward?\" he consented then to retire.\r\n\r\nPost-captains and commanders were required to attend at points on shore\r\nwhere the boats and crews of ships congregated on service; at landing\r\nplaces and watering places,--scenes fruitful in demoralization,--to\r\nmaintain order and suppress disturbance. \"The Masters and Commanders are\r\nto take it in turn, according to rank, to attend the duty on shore at\r\nthe ragged staff [at Gibraltar], from gun-fire in the morning to sunset,\r\nto keep order and prevent disputes, and to see that boats take their\r\nregular turns. They are never to be absent from the spot except at\r\nregular meal times.\" \"When the squadron is at anchor in Torbay [in the\r\nEnglish Channel], a captain of a ship-of-the-line is to command at the\r\nwatering place at Brixham, taking to his assistance his commanding\r\nofficer of marines with a party of his men. He also may take with him a\r\nlieutenant of the ship and as many midshipmen as he thinks fit; _but he\r\nhimself_ is not to quit his command until regularly relieved.\" A greater\r\nstringency is observable at this later date, in the Channel Fleet, than\r\nin the Mediterranean; for at the earlier period the spirit of mutiny had\r\nnot openly broken out, and he had besides on the distant station better\r\ncaptains than those who had clung to the home fleet under its lax\r\ndiscipline. \"Old women in the guise of young men,\" he affirmed many of\r\nthem to be.\r\n\r\nThere was in fact an imminent necessity that naval rank should be made\r\nto feel its responsibilities, and to exert its predominance; to be\r\nrestored to prestige, not by holding aloof in its privileges, but by\r\nasserting itself in act. The preponderance of political and family\r\ninfluence in determining promotion of officers, unbalanced by valid\r\ntests of fitness such as later days imposed, had not only lowered the\r\ncompetency of the official body as a whole, but impaired the respect\r\nwhich personal merit alone can in the long run maintain. On the other\r\nhand, the scarcity of seamen in proportion to the heavy demands of the\r\nwar, and the irregular methods of impressment and recruiting then\r\nprevailing, swept into the service a vast number of men not merely\r\nunfit, but of extremely bad character,--\"miscreants,\" to use\r\nCollingwood's word,--to be ruled only by fear of the law and of their\r\nofficers, supported by the better element among the crews. But these\r\nbetter men also were becoming alienated by the harsh restrictions of the\r\ntimes, and by the procrastination of superiors--Howe, the Sailor's\r\nFriend, among others--to heed their just complaints. The stern Jervis,\r\nwhom none suspected of fatherly tenderness, if less indulgent to\r\nculprits, was far more attentive to meet the reasonable demands of those\r\nunder him. While quelling insubordination mercilessly, he ever sought to\r\nanticipate grievance; exhibiting thus the two sides of the same spirit\r\nof careful, even-handed justice.\r\n\r\nJervis's work during the first eighteen months of his command was\r\ntherefore not only necessary, but most timely. By improving that period\r\nof comparative internal quiet, he educated his officers and men to pass\r\nsteadfastly, though not unmoved, through the awful crisis of the\r\nmutinies in 1797-98. Professional self-respect, a most powerful moral\r\nforce, was more than restored; it was intensified by the added dignity\r\nand power manifest in the surroundings of daily life, as well as in the\r\nmilitary results obtained. Seamen, like others, deal more conservatively\r\nwith that of which they are proud because it reflects honor upon\r\nthemselves; and they obey more certainly men who share their labors and\r\nlead them capably in danger, as did Jervis's Mediterranean captains.\r\nWith himself, severity was far from being the only instrument.\r\nThoroughly capable professionally, and thereby commandful of respect, he\r\nappealed also to men's regard by intelligent and constant thought for\r\nthe wants and comfort of those under him; by evidence of strong service\r\nfeeling on his own part; by clear and clearly expressed recognition of\r\nmerit, wherever found; by avoidance of misunderstandings through\r\nexplanation volunteered when possible,--not apologetically, but as it\r\nwere casually, yet appealing to men's reason. Watchfulness and\r\nsympathetic foresight were with him as constant as sternness, though\r\nless in evidence.\r\n\r\nOf this prevalence of kindly naval feeling amid the harshness which\r\nseemed superficially the chief characteristic of his rule, many\r\ninstances could be cited. Passing by the frequent incidental praise of\r\ndistinguished captains, Nelson, Troubridge, and others, he thus\r\nadvocates the claims of one of the humble, hopeless class of\r\nsailing-masters, out of the line of promotion. After an act of brilliant\r\nmerit in the West Indies, \"Mr. White was ambitious to become a\r\nlieutenant; but not having served six years in the navy, and being a\r\nmaster, I could not then comply with his wishes. He is now Master of the\r\n_Defence_, and his captain speaks in the highest terms of him; and it is\r\na tribute _due to the memory_ of Captain Faulknor,--whose certificate\r\nof that matchless service is enclosed,--and _to the gallantry of his\r\nofficers and crew_, to state the claims of Mr. White to your Lordship,\r\nwho is the protector of us all.\" The present and the past, the merits of\r\nthe living, the memory of the glorious dead, the claims of the navy to\r\nsee well-doers rewarded, are all pressed into service to support a just\r\nrequest, and with a manifest heartiness which in virtue of its reality\r\napproaches eloquence. \"I have given an order to Mr. Ellis to command as\r\na lieutenant, he being the son of a very old officer whom I knew many\r\nyears; and coming very strongly recommended from his last ship, I place\r\nhim under your Lordship's protection as _a child of the service_.\" When\r\na man thus bears others' deserts and the profession on his heart, he can\r\nretain the affections of his subordinates even though he show all the\r\nunbending severity of Jervis, and despite the numerous hangings, which,\r\nfor that matter, rarely fell except on the hopelessly bad. A most\r\nsignificant feature of his rule as a disciplinarian was his peculiar\r\ncare of health, by instructed sanitary measures, by provision of\r\nsuitable diet, and by well-ordered hospital service. This was not merely\r\na prudential consideration for the efficiency of the fleet; he regarded\r\nalso the welfare of the sufferers. He made it a rule to inspect the\r\nhospitals himself, and he directed a daily visit by a captain and by the\r\nsurgeons of the ships from which patients were sent, thus keeping the\r\nsick in touch with those they knew, and who had in them a personal\r\ninterest. An odd provision, amusingly illustrative of the obverse side\r\nof the admiral's character, was that the visiting captain should be\r\naccompanied by a boatswain's mate, the functionary charged with\r\nadministering floggings, and, \"if they find the patients do not conduct\r\nthemselves properly and orderly, they are to punish them agreeably to\r\nthe rules of the Navy.\" It was, however, on his care of health, in its\r\nvarious exposures, that the admiral specially valued himself; it was, he\r\nsaid, his proudest boast among the services to which he laid claim.\r\n\r\nBut while he labored thus for the welfare of the seamen, it was\r\nnaturally upon the professional tone of his officers that his chief\r\nreliance must be placed; and the leaders among them he grappled to his\r\nsoul with hooks of steel, as they recognized the wisdom and force of his\r\nmeasures, and the appreciation given to them and others. Whatever\r\nbeneficent influence might issue from him as a fountain-head must\r\nthrough them be distributed, and by them reinforced and sustained. \"The\r\ndiscipline of the fleet,\" he said, \"is in the ward-room;\" and greatly\r\ndid he lament the loose insubordinate talk, the spirit of irresponsible\r\ncriticism that found voice at mess-tables, within the hearing of\r\nservants, by whom it was disseminated throughout the body of the ship.\r\nNot only he, but many, attributed to this hot-bed the fomenting of\r\ndiscontent into organized mutiny. This could not be stopped by direct\r\nmeasures, but only by imposing a feeling of fear, and nurturing that of\r\nofficer-like propriety, by stringent prescription of forms of respect\r\nand rigid exaction of their observance. To stand uncovered before a\r\nsuperior, instead of lightly touching the hat, to pay outward reverence\r\nto the national flag, to salute the quarter-deck as the seat of\r\nauthority, were no vain show under him. \"Discipline,\" he was fond of\r\nquoting, \"is summed up in the one word, 'Obedience;'\" and these customs\r\nwere charged with the observance which is obedience in spirit. They\r\nconduced to discipline as conventional good manners, by rendering the\r\ndue of each to each, knit together the social fabric and maintain the\r\nregularity and efficiency of common life; removing friction, suppressing\r\njars, and ministering constantly to the smooth and even working of the\r\nsocial machinery.\r\n\r\nBy measures such as these, extending to all ranks and every detail,\r\nexemplifying, in spirit and in form, the extremes of cordial reward,\r\niron restraint, and weighty punishment, Jervis patiently fashioned the\r\nfleet which was to be both a pattern for coming days, and the highly\r\ntempered instrument to achieve his own victory of Cape St. Vincent and\r\nthe earlier triumphs of Nelson; as well as to sustain and to crush the\r\nonset of mutiny which soon afterwards shook the Navy to its centre. For\r\npurely military action of an aggressive character no opportunity was\r\nafforded him. His coming to the Mediterranean coincided with that of\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte to the Army of Italy. During 1795, wrote Nelson, if\r\nthe British fleet had done its duty, the French army could not have\r\nmoved along the Riviera of Genoa. It failed, and the Austrian general,\r\nits ally, also failed to act with vigor. So the year had ended, for the\r\nAustrians, with a disastrous defeat and a retreat behind the Apennines.\r\nTo the Riviera they never returned to receive the co-operation which\r\nJervis stood eager to give. At their first move to cross the mountains,\r\nBonaparte struck, and followed up his blows with such lightning-like\r\nrapidity that in thirty days they were driven back over a hundred miles,\r\nbehind the Adige; their chief fortress, Mantua, was blockaded; all\r\nnorthwest Italy with its seaboard, including Leghorn, was in the power\r\nof France; and Naples also had submitted. Jervis, powerless to strike a\r\nblow when no enemy was within reach, found his fleet without a friendly\r\nport nearer than Gibraltar, while Corsica, where alone he could expect\r\nanchorage and water, was seething with revolt against the British crown,\r\nto which, by its own vote, it had been annexed but two years before.\r\n\r\nAmid these adverse circumstances, the only large operation possible to\r\nhim was the close watching of the port of Toulon, conducted on the same\r\ngeneral plan that was afterwards more illustriously exhibited before\r\nBrest, between 1800 and 1805, under conditions of surpassing difficulty.\r\nAll contemplated movements of the French fleet were thus dammed at the\r\nsource, for it must first fight the British, after which there was\r\nlittle hope of being in a state to fulfil any further mission. For six\r\nmonths, from April to October, Jervis held his fleet close up to the\r\nport, the advanced body two miles from the entrance. The effort was\r\nadmirable as a pattern, and for disciplinary purposes. The ships, forced\r\nto self-dependence, became organically self-reliant. Their routine life\r\nof seamanship and military exercise perfected habit and efficiency, and\r\ndifficulties to others insuperable were as the light burdens which a\r\ngiant carries unwittingly.\r\n\r\nFurther than this, achievement could not then go. During the summer\r\nBonaparte held Mantua by the throat, and overthrew one after another the\r\nAustrian forces approaching to its relief. Two French armies, under\r\nJourdan and Moreau, penetrated to the heart of Germany; while Spain,\r\nlately the confederate of Great Britain, made an offensive and defensive\r\nalliance with France, and sent a fleet of over twenty ships-of-the-line\r\ninto the Mediterranean. Staggered by these reverses, the British\r\nministry ordered Corsica evacuated and the Mediterranean abandoned.\r\nJervis was cruelly embarrassed. A trusted subordinate of high reputation\r\nhad been before Cadiz with seven ships-of-the-line, watching a French\r\ndivision in that port. Summoned, in view of the threatening attitude of\r\nSpain, to reinforce the main fleet in San Fiorenzo Bay, he lost his head\r\naltogether, hurried past Gibraltar without getting supplies, and brought\r\nhis ships destitute to the admiral, already pressed to maintain the\r\nvessels then with him. Although there were thirty-five hostile ships in\r\nToulon and the British had only twenty-two, counting this division,\r\nthere was nothing to do but to send it back to Gibraltar, under urgent\r\norders to return with all speed. With true military insight and a\r\ncorrect appreciation of the forces opposed to him, Jervis saw the need\r\nof fighting the combined enemies then and there.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the division commander, Admiral Mann, on reaching\r\nGibraltar, became infected with the spirit of discouragement then\r\nprevailing in the garrison, called a council of naval captains, and upon\r\ntheir advice, which could in no wise lessen his own responsibility,\r\ndecided to return to England. This culpably unwarrantable act aptly\r\nillustrates the distinction, rarely appreciated, between an error of\r\njudgment and an error of conduct. Upon arrival, he was at once deprived\r\nof his command, a step of unquestionable justice, but which could not\r\nhelp Jervis. \"We were all eyes, looking westward from the mountain\r\ntops,\" wrote Collingwood, then a captain in the fleet, \"but we looked in\r\nvain. The Spanish fleet, nearly double our number, was cruising almost\r\nin view, and our reconnoitring frigates sometimes got among them, while\r\nwe expected them hourly to be joined by the French fleet.\" \"I cannot\r\ndescribe to your lordship,\" wrote Jervis himself, \"the disappointment my\r\nambition and zeal to serve my country have suffered by this diminution\r\nof my force; for had Admiral Mann sailed from Gibraltar on the 10th of\r\nOctober, the day he received my orders, and fulfilled them, I have every\r\nreason to believe the Spanish fleet would have been cut to pieces. The\r\nextreme disorder and confusion they were observed to be in, by the\r\njudicious officers who fell in with them, leave no doubt upon my mind\r\nthat a fleet so trained and generally well commanded as this is would\r\nhave made its way through them in every direction.\"\r\n\r\nNelson shared this opinion, the accuracy of which was soon to be tested\r\nand proved. \"They at home,\" wrote he to his wife, \"do not know what this\r\nfleet is capable of performing; anything and everything. The fleets of\r\nEngland are equal to meet the world in arms; and of all the fleets I\r\never saw, I never beheld one, in point of officers and men, equal to Sir\r\nJohn Jervis's, who is a commander-in-chief able to lead them to glory.\"\r\nTo a friend he wrote: \"Mann is ordered to come up; we shall then be\r\ntwenty-two sail-of-the-line such as England hardly ever produced,\r\ncommanded by an admiral who will not fail to look the enemy in the face,\r\nbe their force what it may. I suppose it will not be more than\r\nthirty-four of-the-line.\" \"The admiral is firm as a rock,\" wrote at the\r\nsame moment the British viceroy of Corsica. Through all doubts and\r\nuncertainties he held on steadily, refusing to leave the rendezvous till\r\ndire necessity forced him, lest Mann, arriving, should be exposed alone\r\nand lost. At last, with starvation staring him in the face if delaying\r\nlonger, he sailed for Gibraltar, three men living on the rations of one\r\nduring the passage down.\r\n\r\nMann's defection had reduced the fleet from twenty-two vessels to\r\nfifteen. A series of single accidents still further diminished it. In a\r\nviolent gale at Gibraltar three ships-of-the-line drove from their\r\nanchors. One, the _Courageux_, stretching over toward the Barbary coast,\r\nran ashore there and was totally wrecked, nearly all her crew perishing.\r\nHer captain, a singularly capable seaman named Hallowell, was out of her\r\nupon a courtmartial, and it was thought she would not have been lost had\r\nhe been on board. Another, the _Gibraltar_, struck so heavily on a reef\r\nthat she had to be sent to England. Upon being docked, a large piece of\r\nrock was found to have penetrated the bottom and stuck fast in the hole.\r\nHad it worked out, the ship would have foundered. The third vessel, the\r\n_Zealous_, was less badly hurt, but she had to be left behind in\r\nGibraltar when Jervis, by orders from home, took his fleet to Lisbon.\r\nThere, in entering the Tagus, a fourth ship was lost on a shoal, so\r\nthat but eleven remained out of twenty-two. Despite these trials of his\r\nconstancy, the old man's temper still continued \"steady as a rock.\"\r\n\"Whether you send me a reinforcement or not,\" he wrote to the Admiralty,\r\n\"I shall sleep perfectly sound,--not in the Tagus, but at sea; for as\r\nsoon as the _St. George_ has shifted her topmast, the _Captain_ her\r\nbowsprit, and the _Blenheim_ repaired her mainmast, I will go out.\"\r\n\"Inactivity in the Tagus,\" he wrote again, \"will make cowards of us\r\nall.\" This last expression summed up much of his naval philosophy. Keep\r\nmen at sea, he used to say, and they cannot help being seamen, though\r\nattention will be needed to assure exercise at the guns. And it may be\r\nbelieved he would thus contemn the arguments which supported Howe's idea\r\nof preserving the ships by retaining them in port. Keep them at sea, he\r\nwould doubtless have replied, and they will learn to take care of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn quitting the river another vessel took the ground, and had to be left\r\nbehind. This, however, was the last of the admiral's trials for that\r\ntime. A few days later, on the 6th of February, 1797, there joined him a\r\nbody of five ships-of-the line, detached from England as soon as the\r\ngovernment had been freed from the fear of the invasion of Ireland,\r\nwhich the French had attempted on a large scale in December. On the\r\n13th, Nelson, a host in himself, returned from an adventurous mission\r\nup the Mediterranean. The next day, February 14th, Jervis with his\r\nfifteen ships met a Spanish fleet of twenty-seven some thirty miles from\r\nCape St. Vincent, which has given its name to the battle.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards were running for Cadiz, to the east-southeast,--say,\r\nacross the page from left to right, inclining a little downward,--while\r\nJervis's fleet was approaching nearly at right angles from the north, or\r\ntop of the page. It was in two close, compact columns, of seven and\r\neight ships respectively. The Spaniards, on the contrary, were in\r\ndisorder and dispersed. Six of their ships were far ahead of the others,\r\nan interval of nearly eight miles separating the two groups. The\r\nweather, which was foggy, cleared gradually. Jervis was walking back and\r\nforth on the poop with Hallowell, lately captain of the wrecked\r\n_Courageux_, and he was heard to say, \"A victory is very essential to\r\nEngland at this moment.\" As ship after ship of the enemy loomed up\r\nthrough the haze, successive reports were made to him. \"There are eight\r\nsail-of-the-line, Sir John.\" \"There are twenty sail-of-the-line, Sir\r\nJohn.\" \"There are twenty-five of-the-line, Sir John.\" Finally, when the\r\nfull tale of twenty-seven was made out, the captain of the fleet\r\nremarked on the greatness of the odds. \"Enough of that, sir,\" retorted\r\nthe admiral, intent on that victory which was so essential to England;\r\n\"if there are fifty sail, I will go through them.\" This reply so\r\ndelighted Hallowell, an eccentric man, who a year later gave Nelson the\r\ncoffin made from the mainmast of the _Orient_, that he patted his august\r\nsuperior on the back. \"That's right, Sir John,\" said he, \"and, by G----,\r\nwe'll give them a d----d good licking!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the weather finally cleared, toward 10 A.M., the British were near\r\nto the enemy and heading direct for the gap, which the Spaniards, too\r\nlate, were trying to close. Almost at the moment of meeting, Jervis\r\nformed his two columns into one--the order of battle--\"with the utmost\r\ncelerity;\" thus doubling the length of the line interposed between the\r\ntwo divisions of the enemy. Soon opened the guns of the leading ship,\r\nthe _Culloden_, Captain Troubridge; the reports following one another in\r\nregular succession, as though firing a salute by watch. The _Culloden's_\r\ncourse led so direct upon a Spanish three-decker, that the first\r\nlieutenant reported a collision imminent. \"Can't help it, Griffiths,\"\r\nreplied Troubridge; \"hardest fend off.\" But the Spaniard, in confusion,\r\nput his helm up and went clear. By this time the Spanish division on the\r\nright, or west, of the British had changed its course and was steering\r\nnorth, parallel but opposite to its foes. As the _Culloden_ went\r\nthrough, the admiral signalled her to put about and follow it.\r\nTroubridge, fully expecting this order, obeyed at once; and Jervis's\r\nsignal was scarce unfurled when, by the flapping of the _Culloden's_\r\nsails, he saw it was receiving execution. \"Look at Troubridge!\" he\r\nshouted. \"Doesn't he handle his ship as though the eyes of all England\r\nwere on him? I would to God they were, that she might know him as I know\r\nhim!\" But here a graver matter drew the admiral's care. The Spanish\r\ndivision from the left, steering across his path of advance, approached,\r\npurposing in appearance to break through the line. The _Victory_\r\nstopped, or, as seamen say, hove-to; and as the Spanish admiral came\r\nnear within a hundred yards, her broadside rang out, sweeping through\r\nthe crowded decks and lofty spars a storm of shot, to which, in the\r\nrelative positions, the foe could not reply. Staggered and crippled he\r\nwent about, and the _Victory_ stood on.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the ships which Troubridge and his followers were pursuing\r\ndrew toward the tail of the British column, and as they did so made a\r\nmovement to pass round it, and so join their friends who had just been\r\nso severely handled in making the attempt to pass through. But Nelson\r\nwas in this part of the order, there being but two ships behind him.\r\nNow, as far as signals went, he should continue on, and, like the\r\nothers, follow in due succession behind the _Culloden_. He saw that if\r\nthis were done the Spaniards would effect their junction, so he\r\ninstantly turned his ship toward the rear, out of her place, and threw\r\nher alone across the enemy's advance. It is said that the Captain of the\r\nFleet drew Jervis's attention to this breach of discipline. \"Ay,\"\r\nreplied the old seaman, \"and if ever you offend in the same way, I\r\npromise you my forgiveness beforehand.\" For a while Nelson took the\r\nbrunt of the hostile fire from half a dozen ships, but not for long.\r\nSoon Troubridge, his dearest friend, came up with a couple of others;\r\nand Collingwood, the close associate of early days, who had the rear\r\nship, was signalled to imitate Nelson's act. In doing this, he silenced\r\nthe fire of two enemies; but, wrote Nelson, \"disdaining the parade of\r\ntaking possession of beaten ships, Captain Collingwood most gallantly\r\npushed on to save his old friend and messmate, who appeared to be in a\r\ncritical state, being then fired upon by three first-rates, and the _San\r\nNicolas_, eighty.\" To get between Nelson's ship and the _San Nicolas_,\r\nCollingwood had to steer close, passing within ten feet of the latter;\r\nso that, to use his own expression, \"though we did not touch sides, you\r\ncould not put a bodkin between us.\" His fire drove the _San Nicolas_\r\nupon one of the first-rates, the _San Josef_; and when, continuing on to\r\nseek other unbeaten foes, he left the field again clear for Nelson, the\r\nlatter, by a movement of the helm, grappled the _San Nicolas_.\r\nIncredible as it may appear, the crew of this one British seventy-four\r\ncarried, sword in hand, both the enemy's ships, though of far superior\r\nforce. \"Extravagant as the story may seem,\" wrote Nelson, \"on the\r\nquarter-deck of a Spanish first-rate I received the swords of the\r\nvanquished Spaniards, which, as I received, I gave to William Fearney,\r\none of my bargemen, who placed them with the greatest _sang-froid_ under\r\nhis arm.\"\r\n\r\nFour Spanish ships, two of them of the largest size, were the trophies\r\nof this victory; but its moral effect in demonstrating the relative\r\nvalues of the two navies, and the confidence England could put in men\r\nlike Jervis, Nelson, and the leading captains, was far greater. The\r\nspirit of the nation, depressed by a long series of reverses, revived\r\nlike a giant refreshed with wine. Jervis had spoken truth when he said a\r\nvictory was essential to England at that time. The gratitude of the\r\nstate was shown in the profusion of rewards showered upon the victors.\r\nPromotions and honors were liberally distributed. The Government had\r\nalready purposed to recognize Jervis's previous services by raising him\r\nto the lower ranks of the peerage; but this timely triumph procured him\r\nat one step a higher elevation. He was created Earl of St. Vincent, with\r\na pension of three thousand pounds per annum.\r\n\r\nThe tactical decisions made by Jervis on this momentous occasion were\r\ncorrect as far as they went; but, except the initial determination to\r\nattack the larger body of the enemy, because to windward, there is no\r\nevidence of tactical originality in him, no innovation comparable to\r\nHowe's manoeuvres on May 28 and 29,--and there was undoubted oversight\r\nin not providing by signal against that move of the weather Spanish\r\ndivision which it became Nelson's opportunity and glory to counteract.\r\nIt is also possible that the signal to tack in succession, a wholly\r\nroutine proceeding, might have been made earlier to advantage; but the\r\nwriter does not think that the body of the fleet should then have tacked\r\ntogether, as some criticism would have it. Until the British van\r\napproached on the new tack, the broadsides of the centre were better\r\nranged on the original line to counteract the efforts, actually made, by\r\nthe lee Spanish division to break through. As regards the decision not\r\nto follow the victory further, which has been censured in the instances\r\nof Rodney and Howe, the conditions here differed in much. The disparity\r\nof numbers was very great; if many of the enemy had suffered greatly,\r\nmany also had not suffered at all; they were now reunited; above all\r\nJervis's strategic and political insight--far superior to his tactical\r\nequipment--had rightly read the situation when he said that what England\r\nneeded was a victory,--moral effect. The victory was there, undeniable\r\nand brilliant, it was better not risked.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the Spaniards, many of them badly crippled, took refuge in\r\nCadiz, and there Jervis, after repairing damages, held them blockaded\r\nfor two years, from April, 1797, to May, 1799. For the greater part of\r\nthis time the operation was conducted by anchoring the British fleet, a\r\nresource which the character of the ground permitted, and which, though\r\nnot everywhere possible, St. Vincent declared the only way of assuring\r\nthe desired end of holding a position in all weathers. During this\r\nperiod was rendered the other most signal service done by him to the\r\nstate, in suppressing the mutinous action of the seamen, which there, as\r\neverywhere else in the British navy at that time, sought to overthrow\r\nthe authority of the officers.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the mutinies of 1797 is not here in question. Suffice it to\r\nsay that, in their origin, they alleged certain tangible material\r\ngrievances which were clearly stated, and, being undeniable, were\r\nredressed. The men returned to their duty; but, like a horse that has\r\nonce taken the bit between his teeth, the restive feeling remained,\r\nfermenting in a lot of vicious material which the exigencies of the day\r\nhad forced the navy to accept. Coinciding in time with the risings in\r\nIreland, 1796-1798, there arose between the two movements a certain\r\nsympathy, which was fostered by the many Irish in the fleets, where\r\nagents were in communication with the leaders of the United Irishmen on\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nIn the Channel and the North Sea, the seamen took the ships, with few\r\nexceptions, out of the hands of their officers. In the former, they\r\ndictated their terms; in the latter, after a month of awful national\r\nsuspense, they failed: the difference being that in the one case the\r\ndemands, being reasonable, carried conviction, while in the other,\r\nbecoming extravagant, the Government's resistance was supported by\r\npublic opinion. It remained to be seen how the crisis would be met in a\r\nfleet so far from home that the issue must depend upon the firmness and\r\njudgment of a man of adamant. It was no more than prudent to expect that\r\nthe attempt would be made there also; and the watchfulness of the\r\nsuperior officers of the fleet soon obtained certain information of its\r\napproach, though as yet without proof adequate to the arrest of\r\nindividuals. The policy of the admiral, broadly stated, was that of\r\nisolating ship from ship--_divide et impera_--to prevent concerted\r\naction; a measure effected to all practical purpose by his unremitting\r\nvigilance, and by the general devotion to his policy among his leading\r\nofficers. On the other hand, evidence was not wanting that in the ships\r\nlong under his orders his own character was now fairly understood, and\r\nobtained for him a backing among the seamen themselves, without which\r\nhis severity alone might have failed.\r\n\r\nThe first overt sign of trouble was the appearance of letters addressed\r\nto the leading petty officers of the different ships of the\r\nMediterranean fleet. These were detected by a captain, who held on to\r\nthem, and sent to St. Vincent to ask if they should be delivered.\r\nCareful to betray no sign of anxiety, the admiral's reply was a general\r\nsignal for a lieutenant from each ship to come to him; and by them word\r\nwas sent that all letters should be delivered as addressed, unopened.\r\n\"Should any disturbance arise,\" he added, \"the commander-in-chief will\r\nknow how to repress it.\"\r\n\r\nDisturbance soon did arise, and it is significant to note that it\r\nappeared in a ship which, by taking the ground when leaving Lisbon, had\r\nnot shared in the Battle of St. Vincent. In July, 1797, two seamen of\r\nthe _St. George_ had been condemned to death for an infamous crime.\r\nTheir shipmates presented a petition, framed in somewhat peremptory\r\nterms, for their liberation, on the ground that execution for such an\r\noffence would bring disgrace upon all. The admiral refusing to pardon,\r\nthe occasion was seized to bring mutiny to a head. A plot to take\r\npossession of the ship was formed, but was betrayed to the captain. The\r\noutburst began with a tumultuous assembling of the crew, evidently,\r\nhowever, mistrustful of their cause. After vainly trying to restore\r\norder, the captain and first lieutenant rushed among them, each\r\ncollaring a ringleader. The rest fell back, weakened, as men of\r\nAnglo-Saxon traditions are apt to be, by the sense of law-breaking. The\r\nculprits were secured, and at once taken to the flag-ship. A\r\ncourtmartial was ordered for the next day, Saturday; and as the\r\nprisoners were being taken to the court, St. Vincent, with a hard\r\nbluntness of speech which characterized him,--a survival of the frank\r\nbrutality of the past century,--said, \"My friends, I hope you are\r\ninnocent, but if you are guilty make your peace with God; for, if you\r\nare condemned, and there is daylight to hang you, you will die this\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nThey were condemned; but the trial ended late, and the president of the\r\ncourt told them they should have Sunday to prepare. \"Sir,\" said the\r\nearl, \"when you passed sentence, your duty was done; you had no right to\r\nsay that execution should be delayed;\" and he fixed it for eight the\r\nnext morning. One of the junior admirals saw fit to address him a\r\nremonstrance upon what he termed a desecration of the Sabbath. Nelson,\r\non the contrary, approved. \"Had it been Christmas instead of Sunday,\"\r\nwrote he, \"I would have hanged them. Who can tell what mischief would\r\nhave been brewed over a Sunday's grog?\" Contrary to previous custom,\r\ntheir own shipmates, the partners and followers in their crime, were\r\ncompelled to hang them, manning the rope by which the condemned were\r\nswayed to the yardarm. The admiral, careful to produce impression,\r\nordered that all the ships should hold divine service immediately upon\r\nthe execution. Accordingly, when the bell struck eight, the fatal gun\r\nwas fired, the bodies swung with a jerk aloft, the church flags were\r\nhoisted throughout the fleet, and all went to prayers. Ere yet the\r\nceremony was over, the Spanish gunboats came out from Cadiz and opened\r\nfire; but St. Vincent would not mar the solemnity of the occasion by\r\nshortening the service. Gravely it was carried to its end; but when the\r\nflags came down, all boats were ordered manned. The seamen, with nerves\r\ntense from the morning's excitement, gladly hurried into action, and the\r\nenemy were forced back into port.\r\n\r\nOne such incident was far from ending the ordeal through which the\r\nadmiral had to pass, and which was prolonged throughout the period of\r\nthe Cadiz blockade. In May, 1798, when Nelson was sent into the\r\nMediterranean to win the Battle of the Nile, the detachment committed to\r\nhim was replaced by a dozen ships-of-the-line from the Channel, seething\r\nwith the mutinous temper which at home had been humored rather than\r\nscotched. Immediately on their joining, request was made for a Court\r\nMartial on some men of the _Marlborough_, on board which two violent\r\nmutinies had occurred,--one on the passage out. St. Vincent, having\r\nknown beforehand that this ship had been pre-eminent for\r\ninsubordination, had ordered her anchored in the centre of the fleet,\r\nbetween the two lines in which it was ranged; and the Court met without\r\ndelay. The remainder of the incident is quoted substantially from one of\r\nSt. Vincent's biographers, for it illustrates most forcibly the\r\nsternness of his action, as well when dealing with weakness in officers\r\nas with mutiny in crews. The written order to the commander of the\r\ndivision of launches appears among the earl's papers, as does also a\r\nsimilar one in the case of a mutiny on board the _Defence_ some months\r\nearlier. The ulterior object of parading these boats was kept profoundly\r\nsecret. They appeared to be only part of the pageantry, of the solemn\r\nceremonial, with which the wisdom of the great commander-in-chief\r\nprovidently sought to invest all exhibitions of authority, in order to\r\ndeepen impression.\r\n\r\nThe object of the last mutiny on board the _Marlborough_ had been to\r\nprotect the life of a seaman forfeited by a capital crime. No sooner was\r\none sentenced to die than the commander-in-chief ordered him to be\r\nexecuted on the following morning, \"and by the crew of the _Marlborough_\r\nalone, no part of the boats' crews from the other ships, as had been\r\nused on similar occasions, to assist in the punishment,--his lordship's\r\ninvariable order on the execution of mutineers. On the receipt of the\r\nnecessary commands for this execution, Captain Ellison of the\r\n_Marlborough_ waited upon the commander-in-chief, and reminding his\r\nlordship that a determination that their shipmates should not suffer\r\ncapital punishment had been the very cause of the ship's company's\r\nmutiny, expressed his conviction that the _Marlborough's_ crew would\r\nnever permit the man to be hanged on board that ship.\r\n\r\n\"Receiving the captain on the _Ville de Paris's_ quarter-deck, before\r\nthe officers and ship's company hearkening in breathless silence to\r\nwhat passed, and standing with his hat in his hand over his head, as\r\nwas his lordship's invariable custom during the whole time that any\r\nperson, whatever were his rank, even a common seaman, addressed him on\r\nservice, Lord St. Vincent listened very attentively till the captain\r\nceased to speak; and then after a pause replied,--\r\n\r\n\"'Do you mean to tell me, Captain Ellison, that you cannot _command_ his\r\nMajesty's ship, the _Marlborough_? for if that is the case, sir, I will\r\nimmediately send on board an officer who can.'\r\n\r\n\"The captain then requested that, at all events, the boats' crews from\r\nthe rest of the fleet might, as always had been customary in the\r\nservice, on executions, attend at this also, to haul the man up; for he\r\nreally did not expect the _Marlborough's_ would do it.\r\n\r\n\"Lord St. Vincent sternly answered: 'Captain Ellison, you are an old\r\nofficer, sir, have served long, suffered severely in the service, and\r\nhave lost an arm in action, and I should be very sorry that any\r\nadvantage should be now taken of your advanced years. That man shall be\r\nhanged, at eight o'clock to-morrow morning, _and by his own ship's\r\ncompany_: for not a hand from any other ship in the fleet shall touch\r\nthe rope. You will now return on board, sir; and, lest you should not\r\nprove able to command your ship, an officer will be at hand who can.'\r\n\r\n\"Without another word Captain Ellison instantly retired. After he had\r\nreached his ship, he received orders to cause her guns to be housed and\r\nsecured, and that at daybreak in the morning her ports should be\r\nlowered. A general order was then issued to the fleet for all launches\r\nto rendezvous under the _Prince_ at seven o'clock on the following\r\nmorning, armed with carronades and twelve rounds of ammunition for\r\nservice; each launch to be commanded by a lieutenant, having an expert\r\nand trusty gunner's-mate and four quarter gunners, exclusive of the\r\nlaunch's crew. The whole were to be under the command of Captain\r\nCampbell, of the _Blenheim_, to whom, on presenting to him the written\r\norders under which he was to act, Lord St. Vincent further said, 'he was\r\nto attend the execution, and if any symptoms of mutiny appeared in the\r\n_Marlborough_, any attempt to open her ports, or any resistance to the\r\nhanging of the prisoner, he was to proceed close touching the ship, and\r\nto fire into her, and to continue to fire until all mutiny or resistance\r\nshould cease; and that, should it become absolutely necessary, he should\r\neven sink the ship in face of the fleet.'\r\n\r\n\"Accordingly, at seven the next morning, all the launches, thus armed,\r\nproceeded, from the _Prince_ to the _Blenheim_, and thence, Captain\r\nCampbell having assumed the command, to the _Marlborough_.\r\n\r\n\"Having lain on his oars a short time alongside, the captain then formed\r\nhis force in a line athwart her bows, at rather less than pistol shot\r\ndistance off, and then he ordered the tompions to be taken out of the\r\ncarronades, and to load.\r\n\r\n\"At half-past seven, the hands throughout the fleet having been turned\r\nup to witness punishment, the eyes of all bent upon a powerfully armed\r\nboat as it quitted the flag-ship; every one knowing that there went the\r\nprovost-marshal conducting his prisoner to the _Marlborough_ for\r\nexecution. The crisis was come; now was to be seen whether the\r\n_Marlborough's_ crew would hang one of their own men.\r\n\r\n\"The ship being in the centre between the two lines of the fleet, the\r\nboat was soon alongside, and the man was speedily placed on the cathead\r\nand haltered. A few awful minutes of universal silence followed, which\r\nwas at last broken by the watch bells of the fleet striking eight\r\no'clock. Instantly the flag-ship's gun fired, and at the sound the man\r\nwas lifted well off; but then, and visibly to all, he dropped back\r\nagain; and the sensation throughout the fleet was intense. For, at this\r\ndreadful moment, when the eyes of every man in every ship was straining\r\nupon this execution, as the decisive struggle between authority and\r\nmutiny, as if it were destined that the whole fleet should see the\r\nhesitating unwillingness of the _Marlborough's_ crew to hang their\r\nrebel, and the efficacy of the means taken to enforce obedience, by an\r\naccident on board the ship the men at the yard-rope unintentionally let\r\nit slip, and the turn of the balance seemed calamitously lost; but then\r\nthey hauled him up to the yard arm with a run. The law was satisfied,\r\nand, said Lord St. Vincent at the moment, perhaps one of the greatest of\r\nhis life, 'Discipline is preserved, sir!'\"\r\n\r\nAgain a year later, in May, 1799, when twenty-five French\r\nships-of-the-line broke through the wretchedly inefficient guard at that\r\ntime kept before Brest, and entered the Mediterranean, a reinforcement\r\nof over a dozen was sent from the Channel to Lord St. Vincent, who was\r\nfound then in Port Mahon, Minorca. Sir Edward Pellew, captain of one of\r\nthe new-comers, asked a Court-Martial upon a mutiny that had occurred\r\njust before leaving the home port. St. Vincent at first demurred,\r\nstartled, according to Pellew's biographer, by the extent of the plot\r\nthen revealed, and thinking it politic to suppress the facts; but it is\r\nalleged with equal probability that he was indignant at being\r\ncontinually called upon to remedy evils due to the general indiscipline\r\nof the Channel Fleet. \"What do they mean by invariably sending the\r\nmutinous ships to me? Do they think that I will be hangman to the\r\nfleet?\" Both versions are likely enough to be correct. There is a limit\r\nto all human endurance, and the earl was now broken in health; he was\r\nsixty-four, had borne his load for three years, and was on the point of\r\nresigning his command to Lord Keith. The Court, however, was ordered,\r\nand three men were sentenced to be hanged. Pellew then interceded for\r\none, on the ground of previous good character. \"No,\" replied St.\r\nVincent. \"Those who have suffered hitherto have been so worthless before\r\nthat their fate was of little use as an example. I shall now convince\r\nthe seamen that no character, however good, shall save a man who is\r\nguilty of mutiny.\"\r\n\r\nBut St. Vincent was not content with mere repression. Outwardly, and\r\nindeed inwardly, unshaken, he yet unwearyingly so ordered the fleet as\r\nto avoid occasions of outbreak. With the imposing moral control exerted\r\nby his unflinching steadiness, little trouble was to be apprehended from\r\nsingle ships; ignorant of what might be hoped from sympathizers\r\nelsewhere, but sure of the extreme penalty in case of failure, the\r\nmovements lacked cohesion and were easily nipped. Concerted action only\r\nwas to be feared, and careful measures were taken to remove\r\nopportunities. Captains were forbidden to entertain one another at\r\ndinner,--the reason, necessarily unavowed, being that the boats from\r\nvarious ships thus assembling gave facilities for transmitting messages\r\nand forming plans; and when ships arrived from England they underwent a\r\nmoral quarantine, no intercourse with them being permitted until\r\nsanctioned by the admiral. When the captain reported to him, his boat,\r\nwhile waiting, was shoved off out of earshot. It is said that on one\r\noccasion a seaman in such a boat managed to call to one looking out of\r\na port of the flag-ship, \"I say, there, what have you fellows been doing\r\nout here, while we have been fighting for your beef and pork?\" To which\r\nthe other replied, \"You'd best say nothing at all about that out here,\r\nfor if old Jarvie hears ye he'll have ye dingle-dangle at the yardarm at\r\neight o'clock to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe severe strain of this prolonged watchfulness told on even his iron\r\nhardihood, and it would almost appear that some of the rough practical\r\njokes told of this period must represent reaction from the tension under\r\nwhich he necessarily was through the grave anxieties pressing upon him.\r\nHumor he certainly had, but at this time it often showed itself in\r\nhorse-play, so fantastic as to suggest some unusual exciting cause.\r\nThus, for one such prank he seemed to draw his inspiration from the\r\nSunday celebration of Divine Service. Upon its conclusion, he framed and\r\npublished a new signal, for \"all chaplains,\" the employment of which,\r\nhowever, was postponed to an occasion suited to his lordship's fun. \"A\r\nfew days after it blew great guns from west-southwest, which is directly\r\ninto the Bay of Cadiz. The inshore squadron lay six miles from the\r\nflag-ship, directly to leeward, and up went the signal for all\r\nchaplains. It was a hard pull for the rowers, and no luxury for the\r\nsitters. When they reached the quarter-deck of the _Ville de Paris_,\r\nliterally drenched with salt-water, the admiral presented them to\r\n'Bishop Morgan,' as he called the chaplain of the flag-ship, and desired\r\nthat they would go down into the ward-room and hold a conclave.\" One who\r\nhas had a pull of that kind, as most officers have in their day, can\r\nunderstand that the humor was less appreciable to the victims than to\r\nthe author.\r\n\r\n\"He sometimes amused himself by paying a visit to the quarter-deck at\r\nwhat most people would deem very unseasonable hours. Coming up one\r\nmorning at half-past two, in the middle watch, he sent for Colonel\r\nFlight, the commanding officer of marines. Up came the colonel, armed at\r\nall points, supposing that some enterprise was in hand. 'I have sent for\r\nyou,' said the Chief, in the quiet and gentlemanly style which he could\r\nalways command, 'I have sent for you, Colonel, that you might smell, for\r\nthe first time in your life, the delicious odors brought off by the land\r\nwind from the shores of Andalusia. Take a good sniff, and then you may\r\ngo and turn in again.'\"\r\n\r\n\"A lieutenant one day came on board to answer a signal. Lord St. Vincent\r\nthought there was about him too much _embonpoint_ for an officer of that\r\nrank. 'Calder,' said he to the captain of the fleet, 'all the\r\nlieutenants are running to belly; they have been too long at anchor (for\r\nthe fleet was still off Cadiz); block up the entering port, except for\r\nadmirals and captains, and make them climb over the hammocks.' The\r\nentering port in a three-decked ship being on the middle deck, the\r\ndifference between going into that and climbing over the hammocks may be\r\ncompared to entering the drawing-room by the balcony window, or mounting\r\nto the parapet and taking the attics by storm. There was also great\r\ninconvenience, and even expense, attending this painful operation, since\r\nin those days all officers wore white knee-breeches, or shorts, as they\r\nwere called, and many useful garments which could not readily be\r\nreplaced, were torn and spoiled in this attempt at juvenile activity,\r\nand many oaths probably sworn, which but for this needless exertion\r\nwould not have been elicited.\"\r\n\r\nA more pleasing, and it may well be believed much more characteristic,\r\ninstance of his playfulness has also been transmitted; one illustrative\r\ntoo of his deep fund of kindliness which was shown in many acts, often\r\nof large pecuniary liberality, and tinged especially with a certain\r\ndistinct service coloring, with sympathy for the naval officer and the\r\nnaval seaman, which must have gone far to obtain for him the obedience\r\nof the will as well as submission of conduct. He wisely believed in the\r\nvalue of forms, and was careful to employ them, in this crisis of the\r\nmutinies, to enforce the habit of reverence for the insignia of the\r\nstate and the emblems of military authority. Young lieutenants--for\r\nthere were _young_ lieutenants in those days--were directed to stand\r\ncap in hand before their superiors, and not merely to touch their hats\r\nin a careless manner. \"The discipline of the cabin and ward-room\r\nofficers is the discipline of the fleet,\" said the admiral; and savage,\r\nalmost, were the punishments that fell upon officers who disgraced their\r\ncloth. The hoisting of the colors, the symbol of the power of the\r\nnation, from which depended his own and that of all the naval hierarchy,\r\nwas made an august and imposing ceremony. The marine guard, of near a\r\nhundred men, was paraded on board every ship-of-the-line. The national\r\nanthem was played, the scarlet-clad guard presented, and all officers\r\nand crews stood bareheaded, as the flag with measured dignity rose\r\nslowly to the staff-head. Lord St. Vincent himself made a point of\r\nattending always, and in full uniform; a detail he did not require of\r\nother officers. Thus the divinity that hedges kings was, by due\r\nobservance, associated with those to whom their authority was delegated,\r\nand the very atmosphere the seaman breathed was saturated with\r\nreverence.\r\n\r\nThe presence of Lord St. Vincent on these occasions, and in full\r\nuniform, gave rise to an amusing skit by one of the lieutenants of the\r\nfleet, attributing the homage exacted, not to the flag, but to the great\r\nman himself; and this, becoming known to the admiral, elicited from him\r\nin turn the exhibition of practical humor to which allusion has just\r\nbeen made. Parodying the Scriptural story of Nebuchadnezzar's golden\r\nimage, the squib began:--\r\n\r\n\"I. The Earl of St. Vincent, the commander-in-chief, made an Image of\r\nblue and gold, whose height was about five feet seven inches, and the\r\nbreadth thereof was about twenty inches\" (which we may infer were the\r\nproportions of his lordship). \"He set it up every ten o'clock A.M. on\r\nthe quarter-deck of the _Ville de Paris_, before Cadiz.\"\r\n\r\nPassing from hand to hand, it can be understood that this effusion,\r\nwhich was characterized throughout by a certain sprightliness, gave more\r\namusement to men familiar with the local surroundings, and welcoming any\r\ntrifle of fun in the dulness of a blockade, than it does to us. At last\r\nit reached the admiral, who knew the author well. Sending for him on\r\nsome pretext, an hour before the time fixed for a formal dinner to the\r\ncaptains of the fleet, he detained him until the meal was served, and\r\nthen asked him to share it. All passed off quietly until the cloth was\r\nremoved, and then the host asked aloud, \"What shall be done to the man\r\nwhom the commander-in-chief delights to honour?\" \"Promote him,\" said one\r\nof the company. \"Not so,\" replied St. Vincent, \"but set him on high\r\namong the people. So, Cumby,\" addressing the lieutenant, \"do you sit\r\nthere,\"--on a chair previously arranged at some height above the\r\ndeck,--\"and read this paper to the captains assembled.\" Mystified, but\r\nnot yet guessing what was before him, Cumby took his seat, and, opening\r\nthe paper, saw his own parody. His imploring looks were lost upon the\r\nadmiral, who sat with his stern quarter-deck gravity unshaken, while the\r\nabashed lieutenant, amid the suppressed mirth of his audience, stumbled\r\nthrough his task, until the words were reached, \"Then the Earl of St.\r\nVincent was full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against\r\nthe poor Captain of the Main-Top,\" who had not taken off his hat before\r\nthe Image of blue and gold. Here a roar of laughter from the head of the\r\ntable unloosed all tongues, and Cumby's penance ended in a burst of\r\ngeneral merriment. \"Lieutenant Cumby,\" said the admiral, when quiet was\r\nrestored, \"you have been found guilty of parodying Holy Writ to bring\r\nyour commander-in-chief into disrespect; and the sentence is that you\r\nproceed to England at once on three months' leave of absence, and upon\r\nyour return report to me to take dinner here again.\"\r\n\r\nCompelled by general break-down of health to seek rest at home, St.\r\nVincent returned to England in August, 1799. He was not left long in\r\nrepose. The condition of the Channel Fleet as regards discipline has\r\nalready appeared, and the very recent incident of the escape of the\r\ngreat French fleet from Brest, coupled with the equally humiliating and\r\neven more threatening experience of the same character in 1796, when the\r\ninvasion of Ireland was attempted,--both which occurred under the same\r\nBritish commander-in-chief,--showed the urgent necessity of placing in\r\ncontrol the only man of suitable rank, whose complete adequacy to such a\r\npost had been demonstrated. St. Vincent accordingly hoisted his flag in\r\nApril, 1800.\r\n\r\nIn the effort to restore discipline, he here encountered not only\r\nopposition, intensified by the greater desire for shore privileges that\r\nalways attends a home station and the proximity of wives and children,\r\nbut something very like an attempt at combination against his orders--a\r\nvery grave military offence--on the part of the captains. All this he\r\ntrampled down with severity amounting to ruthlessness. The insubordinate\r\ntoast--\"May the discipline of the Mediterranean never be introduced into\r\nthe Channel Fleet\"--was met face to face by republishing every order and\r\nrestriction upon which the discipline of the Mediterranean had rested.\r\nIn the more distinctly military part of his task, the closing of the\r\nport of Brest to evasions by the enemy, such as those just mentioned, he\r\nachieved a noteworthy success. Modelling his scheme upon that of Hawke,\r\nforty years before, he gave to it a development, a solidity, and an\r\nextension which his distinguished forerunner had not been able to\r\nimpart. Hawke had not the advantage, which St. Vincent had, of following\r\na period of inefficiency, the remembrance of which compelled the\r\nAdmiralty vigorously to support all measures of the commander-in-chief,\r\nif they desired to replace the interminable uncertainties and anxieties\r\nof the last administration of the fleet by a sense of security, and\r\nconsequent popular content.\r\n\r\nSt. Vincent's institution and maintenance of the Brest blockade must be\r\nregarded under two principal heads. There is, first, the usefulness of\r\nthe blockade as an instrument to the general ends of the current war,\r\nwhich is the strategic point of view, involving a conception permanent\r\nin character; and there are again the local dispositions, arising from\r\nthe local conditions, that may rightly be styled tactical, and vary from\r\nport to port thus watched. The former, the strategic, was more directly\r\nin line with his natural gifts; and in the possession which the idea\r\ntook of him is to be found the germ of the system that thenceforward\r\nbegan to throttle the power of the French Revolution, whether under the\r\nRepublic or the Empire. The essence of the scheme was to cut loose from\r\nthe beach, and keep to the sea; ever watchful, with the same\r\nwatchfulness that had not only crushed mutiny, but by diligent care\r\nforestalled occasions of revolt. \"Our great reliance,\" he said,--not\r\ndirectly in reference to the blockade, but to the general thought of\r\nwhich the blockade, as instituted by him, was the most illustrious\r\nexemplification,--\"is on the vigilance and activity of our cruisers at\r\nsea, any reduction in the number of which, by applying them to guard our\r\nports, inlets, and beaches, would in my judgment tend to our\r\ndestruction.\" Amplified as the idea was by him, when head of the\r\nAdmiralty, to cover not only Brest but all ports where hostile divisions\r\nlay, it became a strategic plan of wide sweep, which crushed the\r\nvitality of the hostile navies, isolated France from all support by\r\ncommerce, and fatally sapped her strength. To St. Vincent, more than to\r\nany one man, is due the effective enforcement and maintenance of this\r\nsystem; and in this sense, as practically the originator of a decisive\r\nmethod, he is fairly and fully entitled to be considered the organizer\r\nof ultimate victory.\r\n\r\nThe local dispositions before Brest will not here be analyzed.[14]\r\nSuffice it to say that, as revealed in Jervis's correspondence, they\r\nshow that equipment of general professional knowledge, that careful\r\nstudy of conditions,--of what corresponds to \"the ground\" of a shore\r\nbattle-field,--and the thoughtful prevision of possibilities, which\r\nconstitute so far the skilful tactician. The defence and the attack of\r\nseaports, embracing as they do both occupation of permanent positions\r\nand the action of mobile bodies, are tactical questions; differing much,\r\nyet not radically, from field operations, where positions are taken\r\nincidentally, but where movement of armed men is the principal factor.\r\nIn the one sense St. Vincent displayed a high degree of aptitude for\r\nordered permanent dispositions, which is the side of tactics most akin\r\nto strategy. On the more distinctively tactical side, in the movements\r\nof a fleet in action, he had little opportunity. As far as shown by his\r\none battle, Cape St. Vincent, it would not appear that either by nature\r\nor cultivation he possessed to any great extent the keen insight and\r\nquick appreciation that constitute high tactical ability.\r\n\r\nEarl St. Vincent rendered three great services to England. The first was\r\nthe forming and disciplining the Mediterranean fleet into the perfection\r\nthat has been mentioned. Into it, thus organized, he breathed a spirit\r\nwhich, taking its rise from the stern commander himself, rested upon a\r\nconviction of power, amply justified in the sequel by Cape St. Vincent\r\nand the Nile, its two greatest achievements. The second was the winning\r\nof the Battle of St. Vincent at a most critical political moment. The\r\nthird was the suppression of mutiny in 1797 and 1798. But, in estimating\r\nthe man, these great works are not to be considered as isolated from his\r\npast and his future. They were the outcome and fruitage of a character\r\nnaturally strong, developed through long years of patient sustained\r\ndevotion to the ideals of discipline and professional tone, which in\r\nthem received realization. Faithful in the least, Jervis, when the time\r\ncame, was found faithful also in the greatest. Nor was the future\r\nconfined to his own personal career. Though he must yield to Nelson the\r\nrare palm of genius, which he himself cannot claim, yet was the glory\r\nof Nelson, from the Nile to Trafalgar, the fair flower that could only\r\nhave bloomed upon the rugged stalk of Jervis's navy. Upon him,\r\ntherefore, Nelson showered expressions of esteem and reverence,\r\namounting at times almost to tenderness, in his early and better days.\r\nIn later years their mutual regard suffered an estrangement which,\r\nwhatever its origin, appears as a matter of feeling to have been chiefly\r\non the part of the younger man, whose temper, under the malign influence\r\nof an unworthy passion, became increasingly imbittered, at strife within\r\nitself and at variance with others. The affectionate admiration of St.\r\nVincent for his brilliant successor seems to have remained proof against\r\nexternal differences.\r\n\r\nIt was poetic justice, then, that allotted to St. Vincent the\r\narrangement of the responsible expedition which, in 1798, led to the\r\ncelebrated Battle of the Nile; in its lustre and thorough workmanship\r\nthe gem of all naval exploits. To him it fell to choose for its command\r\nhis brilliant younger brother, and to winnow for him the flower of his\r\nfleet, to form what Nelson after the victory called \"his band of\r\nbrothers.\" \"The Battle of the Nile,\" said the veteran admiral, Lord\r\nHowe, \"stands singular in this, that every captain distinguished\r\nhimself.\" The achievement of the battle was Nelson's own, and Nelson's\r\nonly; but it was fought on St. Vincent's station, by a detachment from\r\nSt. Vincent's fleet. He it was who composed the force, and chose for\r\nits leader the youngest flag-officer in his command. Bitter reclamations\r\nwere made by the admirals senior to Nelson, but St. Vincent had one\r\nsimple sufficient reply,--\"Those who are responsible for measures must\r\nhave the choice of the men to execute them.\"\r\n\r\nWhen St. Vincent, in 1799, quitted the Mediterranean, he had yet nearly\r\na quarter of a century to live. His later years were distinguished by\r\nimportant services, but they embody the same spirit and exemplify the\r\nsame methods that marked his Mediterranean command, which was the\r\nculminating period of his career. In 1801, when Pitt's long term of\r\noffice came to an end, he became First Lord of the Admiralty,--the head\r\nof naval affairs for the United Kingdom,--and so continued during the\r\nAddington administration, till 1804. In 1806, at the age of seventy-two,\r\nhe was again for a short time called to command the Channel fleet; but\r\nin 1807 he retired from active service, and the square flag that had so\r\nlong flown with honor was hauled down forever.\r\n\r\nThe rest of his life was spent chiefly at his country-seat, Rochetts, in\r\nEssex, sixteen miles from London. Having a handsome income, though not\r\nwealthy, he entertained freely; and his retreat was cheered by frequent\r\nvisits from his old naval subordinates and political friends. Generous\r\nin the use of money, and without children for whom to save, the\r\nneighborhood learned to love him as a benefactor. In cases of necessity,\r\nhis liberality rose to profusion, and he carried into the management of\r\nhis estate a carelessness he never showed in administering a fleet. It\r\nis told that he once undertook to raise a sum by mortgage, in entire\r\nforgetfulness of a much larger amount in bank. Far into old age he\r\nretained the active habits of his prime. To say that he rose at four,\r\nasserts a biographer, would be to understate the case; he was frequently\r\nin the fields at half-past two in the early summer dawn of\r\nEngland,--always before his laborers,--and he was not pleased if his\r\nmale guests did not appear by six. To ladies he was more tolerant. With\r\nmind unclouded and unweakened to the last, he retained his interest in\r\npublic affairs and in the navy, contributing to the conversation which\r\nanimated his home the judgment of an acute intellect, though one deeply\r\ntinged by prejudices inseparable from so strong a character. Thus\r\nhonored and solaced by the companionship of his friends, he awaited in\r\ncalm dignity the summons, which came on the 13th of March, 1823. He was\r\ntwo months over eighty-eight when he passed away, the senior admiral of\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[14] This has been done by the author elsewhere (Influence of Sea Power\r\nupon the French Revolution and Empire, Vol. I. pp. 371-377).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUMAREZ\r\n\r\n1757-1836\r\n\r\n\r\n\"These were honourable among the thirty,\" says the ancient Hebrew\r\nchronicler, \"yet they attained not unto the first three.\" Since that\r\nfar-away day, when the three mighty men broke through the host of the\r\nPhilistines that they might bring their chieftain water from the well of\r\nBethlehem, to how many fighters, land and sea, have these words been\r\napplicable!--men valiant in deed, wise in council, patient in endurance,\r\nyet lacking that divine somewhat which, for want of a better name, we\r\ncall genius. Of such an one now, and, in contrasted sequence, of another\r\nof his peers, we are about to give an account; men who in their\r\nrespective careers illustrated more conspicuously, the one the\r\ndistinctively military, the other the more purely nautical, aspects, in\r\nthe due blending of which the excellence of the profession is realized;\r\nforemost, both, among the ocean warriors whose pennants flew through the\r\nwild scenes where England's flag was called to brave the battle and the\r\nbreeze,\r\n\r\n    \"Till danger's troubled night depart,\r\n        And the star of peace return.\"\r\n\r\nJames Saumarez was born on the 11th of March, 1757, in Guernsey, one of\r\nthe Channel group of islands that still remain attached to the English\r\ncrown,--the sole remaining fragment of the Norman duchy to which the\r\nkingdom itself was for a while but an appendage. In Saumarez's\r\nchildhood, French was still so generally spoken there that, despite the\r\nvery early age at which he went to sea, he always retained a perfect\r\nmastery of that language; and it is recorded that one of his uncles,\r\nbeing intended for the sea service, was sent to school in England when\r\nten years old, in order to acquire the use of English. From such a\r\nstock, whose lineage among the gentry of the island can be traced to the\r\nfourteenth century, sprang three distinguished officers of this name,\r\ndestined to illustrate the British flag by their deeds in several wars,\r\nin which their chief opponent was the French navy. Among these, the\r\nsubject of this article attained the most brilliant renown. Eighteen\r\nmonths older than Nelson, not even Nelson saw more or harder fighting\r\nthan did James Saumarez, nor bore himself more nobly throughout their\r\nday and generation.\r\n\r\nHaving early shown a taste for the navy, his father, who had six sons\r\nand a restricted income, obtained of a naval captain to have his name\r\nborne on the books of a ship of war at the early age of ten; a curious\r\ncustom of that day allowing such constructive service to be counted in\r\nthe time prescribed for attaining a lieutenant's commission. The boy did\r\nnot actually go afloat until 1770, when a little over thirteen. This\r\nfirst employment kept him from home continuously for five years, a\r\nperiod spent wholly in the Mediterranean, and for the most part in the\r\nLevant; the active naval war then existing between Turkey and Russia, in\r\nthe waters of Asia Minor, necessitating a special protection to British\r\ninterests. It is a singular circumstance that this sea, esteemed so\r\nimportant to Great Britain, was never again visited by him, with the\r\nexception of the few brief months from May to October, 1798, when, as\r\nsecond in command, he followed Nelson's flag during the pursuit of\r\nBonaparte's fleet which ended in its destruction at the Battle of the\r\nNile.\r\n\r\nReturning to England in 1775, his actual and constructive service\r\npermitted Saumarez to appear for examination for a lieutenancy. This he\r\npassed, but was not at once promoted. The troubles with the American\r\ncolonies had now become open hostilities, and he was appointed, as\r\nmaster's mate or passed midshipman, to the _Bristol_ of fifty guns,\r\nselected as flag-ship for the expedition against Charleston. This duty,\r\nwhich, by bringing him immediately under the eyes of the naval\r\ncommander-in-chief, placed him also on the highway to advancement, he\r\nowed to Admiral Keppel, then one of the leading flag officers of the\r\nBritish navy. His uncle, Philip Saumarez, and Keppel had shared the\r\nperils and sufferings of Anson's well-known expedition to the South Seas\r\nin 1740. Together they had buffeted the wild weather off Cape Horn, with\r\nships' companies more than decimated by scurvy; together they had spread\r\nterror among the Spanish colonies of the Pacific; together they had\r\ncaptured the great galleon off Manila; and Keppel still retained an\r\naffectionate interest in the kinsman of his old shipmate, who had long\r\nsince fallen gloriously on the deck of his ship, in close action with a\r\nFrench vessel of far superior force.\r\n\r\nThe squadron, which was commanded by Commodore Sir Peter Parker,\r\nassembled at Cork, whence it sailed in January, 1776. Embarked on board\r\nthe _Bristol_ was Lord Cornwallis, afterwards so closely, and for\r\nhimself disastrously, associated with the course of the American\r\nRevolution. Struck by Saumarez's activity and efficiency, he offered him\r\na commission in his own regiment, with the position of aide-de-camp to\r\nhimself. The young seaman, having a naturally strong military bent,\r\nwhich at that moment seemed more likely to receive satisfaction on shore\r\nthan at sea, and swayed doubtless also by the prospect of a powerful\r\npatron, in the days when patronage had so much to do with men's careers,\r\nwas on the point of accepting; but his messmates chaffed him so\r\nmercilessly upon adopting a profession which habitually supplied them\r\nwith derisive illustrations and comparisons, that he finally declined.\r\nMany years later, when Saumarez was among the senior captains of the\r\nnavy, the two gentlemen met as guests at the table of the head of the\r\nAdmiralty, who upon hearing the incident from Cornwallis remarked that\r\nhe would have deprived the navy of one of its best officers.\r\n\r\nOwing partly to delays inseparable from sailing vessels, and partly to\r\nthe dilatoriness with which war was most often waged before the days of\r\nthe French Revolution, the British expedition did not appear off\r\nCharleston until the beginning of June, 1776. To Americans who know\r\ntheir own history, the stirring story of Fort Moultrie and its repulse\r\nof the British fleet has been familiar from childhood. Few are the\r\nAmerican boys to whom the names of Jasper, of Marion, and of their brave\r\ncommander, Moultrie himself, are unknown. But while all honor is due to\r\nthe band of raw provincials who at this critical moment--one week before\r\nthe Declaration of Independence was signed--withstood the enemy, and for\r\nthe moment saved the province, the steady, obstinate valor shown by the\r\nseamen of kindred race, who contended with them, was no less brilliant,\r\nand was even more severely tested. The loss of the fort was thirty-seven\r\nkilled and wounded; that of the _Bristol_ alone was one hundred and\r\neleven out of a crew of three hundred and fifty; and during much of the\r\naction, which lasted thirteen hours, she was powerless to return the\r\nraking fire of the enemy, in consequence of shot severing the ropes that\r\nkept her broadside in position. Saumarez was here for the first time\r\nengaged, and had two narrow escapes. Once, when pointing a gun, a\r\ncannon-ball entering the port swept away seven of the eight men who\r\nserved the piece; and somewhat later another ball struck off the head of\r\na messmate by whom he was standing, covering him with blood.\r\n\r\nIn this, his maiden action, Saumarez gave full proof of the steady\r\ncourage which ever distinguished him; and it is worthy of passing remark\r\nthat, in the doggedness of the fighting and the severity of the\r\nslaughter, the battle was typical of a great part of his after\r\nexperience. Several death vacancies resulting among the officers, he was\r\npromoted to be lieutenant a fortnight later; and when the _Bristol_ went\r\nnorth he was again actively engaged in the operations on Long Island,\r\nand along the East and Hudson rivers, up to the evacuation of New York\r\nby the Americans. His conspicuous activity at length obtained for him\r\nthe command of a galley, with which he was sent to Rhode Island in\r\nFebruary, 1778. The judgment of the illustrious Rodney, as well as the\r\nrepeated efforts of the Americans to regain control of Narragansett Bay,\r\nmay be cited against the opinion expressed by Bancroft, that the seizure\r\nof this important naval centre by the British was a mistake. The tenure\r\nof the island, however, depended upon the control of the surrounding\r\nwaters, and upon the active destruction of the American means of\r\ntransport. Saumarez's galley was one of the force stationed in the\r\neastern, or Seakonnet, passage; and in the five months thus employed it\r\nis recorded that he was forty-seven times under fire.\r\n\r\nSullivan was at this time preparing for his attack upon the British\r\nlines, expecting co-operation by the French fleet. This arrived on the\r\n29th of July, and six days later Seakonnet Channel was entered by a\r\ndetachment superior in force to the British there. The latter burned\r\ntheir ships and retreated to Rhode Island, where the officers and\r\nseamen, Saumarez among them, continued actively engaged in the defence\r\nof the works. On August 8th, the main French fleet, under the Count\r\nd'Estaing, ran the batteries of the principal channel, and anchored off\r\nthe north end of the island, seriously increasing the perils of the\r\ndefenders; but next day the appearance of Lord Howe with an inferior\r\nsquadron lured the French admiral out of the bay, his vessels were\r\ncrippled by a storm, and he abandoned the coast. Sullivan, deprived of\r\nan essential factor in his scheme, had then to fall back; and the\r\nBritish captains, with their crews, being no longer needed, returned to\r\nEngland to seek other ships.\r\n\r\nBoth by fortune and by choice, Saumarez's lot throughout life was thrown\r\nwith the line-of-battle force of the navy, that body of heavy fighting\r\nships which constitute the true backbone of a sea service, because their\r\nessential function is to fight, not singly, but in masses, co-operating\r\nwith others like themselves. In that respect they correspond to the\r\nsolid masses of infantry, which, however disposed tactically, form the\r\nstrength of armies. The aptitudes of brilliant officers differ. Some are\r\nborn frigate-captains, partisan warriors, ever actively on the wing, and\r\nrejoicing in the comparative freedom and independence of their\r\nmovements, like the cavalry raider and outpost officer. Of this type was\r\nPellew, Lord Exmouth, a seaman inbred, if ever there was one, who in\r\nthis sphere won the renown most distinctively associated with his name,\r\nwhile giving proof throughout a long career of high professional\r\ncapacity in many directions. But while Saumarez, in his turn, was\r\noccasionally employed in frigate and light cruiser service, and always\r\nwith great credit, his heart was with the ship-of-the-line, whose high\r\norganization, steady discipline, and decisive influence upon the issues\r\nof war appealed to a temperament naturally calm, methodical, and\r\nenduring. \"He always preferred the command of a ship-of-the-line to a\r\nfrigate,\" says his biographer, who knew him well,--\"notwithstanding the\r\nchances of prize-money are in favor of the latter;\" and he himself\r\nconfirmed the statement, not only by casual utterance,--\"My station as\r\nrepeating frigate is certainly more desirable than a less conspicuous\r\none, at the same time I would rather command a seventy-four,\"--but by\r\nrepeated formal applications. In variety and interest of operations, as\r\nwell as in prize-money, did a cruising frigate have advantages; for much\r\nof the time of ships-of-the-line passed necessarily in methodical\r\nroutine and combined movements, unfavorable to individual initiative.\r\nNevertheless, their functions are more important and more military in\r\ncharacter. In accordance with this preference Saumarez is found, whether\r\nby his own asking or not, serving the remaining three years of his\r\nlieutenant's time upon vessels of that class; and in one of them he\r\npassed through his next general action, a scene of carnage little\r\ninferior to the Charleston fight, illustrated by the most dogged courage\r\non the part of the combatants, but also, it must be said, unrelieved by\r\nany display of that skill which distinguishes scientific warfare from\r\naimless butchery. This, however, was not Saumarez's fault.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1780, Great Britain, having already France, Spain,\r\nand America upon her hands, found herself also confronted by a league\r\nbetween the Baltic states to enforce by arms certain neutral claims\r\nwhich she contested. To this league, called the Armed Neutrality,\r\nHolland acceded, whereupon England at once declared war. Both nations\r\nhad extensive commercial interests in the Baltic, and it was in\r\nprotecting vessels engaged in this trade, by a large body of ships of\r\nwar, that the only general action between the two navies occurred. This\r\nwas on the 5th of August, 1781, in the North Sea, off the Dogger-Bank,\r\nfrom which it has taken its name.\r\n\r\nAt the time of meeting, the British, numbering six ships-of-the-line,\r\nwere returning from the Baltic; the Dutch, with seven ships, were bound\r\nthither. Despite the numerical difference, no great error is made in\r\nsaying that the two squadrons were substantially of equal force. Each at\r\nonce ordered the merchant vessels under its protection to make the best\r\nof their way towards port, while the ships of war on either side began\r\nto form in order of battle between the enemy and their own convoy. The\r\nlists being thus cleared and the lines ranged, the British vessels,\r\nwhich were to windward, stood down together, after what was then the\r\ntime-honored and unintelligent practice of their service, each to attack\r\none of the Dutch; disdaining to attempt doubling upon any part of the\r\nhostile line. Their ideal appears to have been that of the tournament,\r\nwhere every advantage of numbers and combination was rejected in order\r\nto insure that the test should be that of individual courage and skill.\r\nSo strong was this tradition in the British navy that its ablest\r\ncontemporary chronicler, James, has sought to explain away, half\r\napologetically, the advantage gained by Nelson in doubling on the French\r\nvan at the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch, equally quixotic, refrained from taking advantage of the\r\nenemy's inability to use his broadsides while thus approaching nearly\r\nhead-on. Arrayed in a close column, the ships about six hundred feet\r\napart, the crews at the guns, and the marines drawn up on the poops,\r\nthey waited in silence until the English, at 8 A.M., were in position at\r\nhalf musket shot. Then the battle-flag was hoisted by each admiral, and\r\nall opened together, the conflict raging with fury for nearly four\r\nhours. It was the first time since the days of the great De Ruyter, more\r\nthan a century before, that these kindred people had thus met in fair\r\nfight upon the sea. Equal in courage and in seamanship, and each\r\nneglecting to seek a tactical advantage, the usual result followed. Many\r\nmen were killed and wounded, no ship was taken, and the combatants\r\nseparated after a drawn battle; but as one Dutch ship sank the next day,\r\nand their convoy could not proceed, the British claimed a victory. Their\r\nown merchant vessels, being on the return voyage, were able to complete\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSaumarez had shown his usual gallantry, and was again promoted. On the\r\n23d of August, eighteen days after the action, he was made commander\r\ninto the _Tisiphone_, a small but fast cruiser, technically called a\r\nfire-ship, and attached to the Channel fleet. In December, the British\r\ngovernment learned that a large number of transports and supply ships\r\nwere about to sail from Brest for the West Indies. These were to carry\r\ntroops and stores to the fleet of Count De Grasse, who had returned to\r\nMartinique after the surrender at Yorktown, and was now about to\r\nundertake the conquest of Jamaica. It was imperative to intercept an\r\nexpedition so essential to the success of the French plan, and Admiral\r\nKempenfelt--the same who afterwards, in the _Royal George_, \"went down\r\nwith twice four hundred men\"--was sent in pursuit with twelve\r\nships-of-the-line. The _Tisiphone_ accompanied them as lookout vessel,\r\nand on the 12th of December, 1781, being then well ahead of the fleet,\r\nshe was able to signal the admiral that the enemy was in sight to\r\nleeward with seventeen of-the-line; but that the latter, instead of\r\nbeing between the British and the transports, were on the far side.\r\nKempenfelt, an able tactician as well as seaman, seized his advantage,\r\npushed between the men-of-war and the convoy, and carried off fifteen\r\nsail laden with military and naval stores, of great money value and\r\ngreater military importance. More could not be done without risking a\r\nbattle with a too superior force. It was essential, therefore, to\r\napprise the British commander in the West Indies of the approach of the\r\nFrench reinforcements as well as of Kempenfelt's successes, and the\r\n_Tisiphone_ was the same day despatched on this errand.\r\n\r\nAlthough he knew it not, Saumarez was now being borne by the tide which\r\nleads on to fortune. The next step in promotion then fixed, and still\r\nfixes, the seniority of a British officer, and the _Tisiphone's_\r\nmission led him straight to it. Easily outsailing the unwieldy mass of\r\nenemies, he reached Barbados, and there learned that the British fleet,\r\nunder Sir Samuel Hood, was anchored off the island of St. Christopher,\r\nthen invaded by a French army supported by De Grasse's fleet. The tenure\r\nof the island depended upon a fort on Brimstone Hill, still held by the\r\nBritish; and Hood, though much inferior in force, had by a brilliant\r\ntactical move succeeded in dislodging De Grasse from his anchorage\r\nground, taking it himself, and establishing there his fleet in such\r\norder that its position remained impregnable. The French, however,\r\ncontinued cruising to the southward, off the adjoining island of Nevis,\r\nwhere they interposed between Hood and Saumarez; and the latter could\r\nreach his commander only by threading the reefs lining the passage\r\nbetween the two islands,--a feat considered hazardous, if not\r\nimpracticable. Nevertheless, the _Tisiphone_ effected it by diligent\r\ncare and seamanship, joining the fleet on January 31st, 1782.\r\n\r\nSaumarez now found himself in the midst of the most active operations,\r\nat the opening of a campaign which promised to be of singular and\r\ncritical importance. But in the midst of his rejoicing at the good\r\nfortune which had transferred him from the comparative inactivity of the\r\nChannel fleet, a momentary reverse befell. Called by signal on board the\r\nflag-ship, he received a bag of despatches, with orders to sail that\r\nnight for England. As he went dejectedly down the ship's side to his\r\nboat and was shoving off, the gig of a post-captain pulled alongside.\r\n\"Hallo, Saumarez,\" said its occupant, \"where are you going?\" \"To\r\nEngland, I grieve to say.\" \"Grieve!\" rejoined the other. \"I wish I were\r\nin your place. I have been wanting this long time to go home for my\r\nhealth. Hold on a moment; perhaps it can be arranged.\" The new-comer,\r\nnamed Stanhope, went at once to the admiral, who a few minutes later\r\nsent for Saumarez. Hood had learned to value the active young officer\r\nwho had taken a forward part in the guerilla enterprises of the fleet.\r\n\"Captain Saumarez,\" he said, \"you know not how much I wish to serve you.\r\nCaptain Stanhope shall go home, as he desires, and you shall have\r\ncommand of the _Russell_.\" The same night the _Tisiphone_ sailed;\r\nSaumarez remaining as an acting post-captain, with a ship of\r\nseventy-four guns under him.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that two months later, at the age of twenty-five,\r\nSaumarez commanded a ship-of-the-line in Rodney's renowned battle of the\r\n12th of April; with one exception the most brilliant and decisive action\r\nfought by the British navy in a century. This circumstance alone would\r\nhave insured the confirmation of his rank by the Admiralty, even had he\r\nnot also eminently distinguished himself; but it was for him one of\r\nthose periods when inconstant fortune seems bent upon lavishing her\r\nfavors. He was near the head of the British column, as the hostile\r\nfleets passed in opposite directions, exchanging broadsides. As his ship\r\ncleared the French rear, a neighboring British vessel, commanded by one\r\nof the senior captains, turned to pursue the enemy. Saumarez gladly\r\nimitated him; but when the other resumed his former course, because the\r\nadmiral of the van, his immediate superior, had not turned, the\r\n_Russell_ kept on after the French. At this moment, Rodney in the centre,\r\nand Hood in the rear, favored by a change of wind, were breaking through\r\nthe French line. The _Russell's_ course carried her toward them, and\r\nconsequently, in the _mêlée_ which followed, she had the distinguished\r\nhonor of engaging De Grasse's flag-ship, and of being in action with her\r\nwhen she surrendered. Indeed, although Saumarez with characteristic\r\nmodesty refrained from pressing his claim, he always, when questioned on\r\nthe subject, maintained that although the enemy's vessel certainly\r\nstruck to Hood's flag-ship, she did so immediately upon the latter\r\njoining the _Russell_.\r\n\r\nHowever regarded, this was a brilliant achievement for so young a\r\ncaptain, less than a twelvemonth having elapsed since he was but a\r\nlieutenant. Rodney, who had meanwhile signalled his van to go about, was\r\nsomewhat perplexed at finding a single ship thus opportunely in the\r\ndirection whence the _Russell_ appeared; and, upon being informed that\r\nshe belonged to the van squadron, declared that her commander had\r\ndistinguished himself above all others in the fleet. It proved, in fact,\r\nthe keen military sense of the demands of an occasion which constitutes\r\nthe born corps or division commander. This was Saumarez's third general\r\naction, at a time when Nelson, although three years a post-captain, had\r\ncommanded only frigates, and had never seen a battle between fleets.\r\nBut, if Saumarez used well the singular opportunities with which fortune\r\nfavored him, it was characteristic of Nelson that his value transpired\r\nthrough the simplest intercourse and amid the most commonplace incidents\r\nof service. Men felt, rather than realized, that under the slight,\r\nquaint, boyish exterior there lay the elements of a great man, who would\r\none day fulfil his own boast of climbing to the top of the tree; and he\r\nhad been made a full captain in 1779, when not quite twenty-one.\r\nAccording to the rule of the British service, already mentioned, this\r\nassured for life his precedence over Saumarez, promoted in 1782.\r\n\r\nThe latter, however, if outstripped by a younger competitor, who was to\r\nbecome the greatest of British admirals, had secured a position of\r\nvantage for that great war which then lay in the womb of the future.\r\nReturning to England in 1782, he passed in retirement the ten years that\r\npreceded the outbreak of hostilities with the French republic. During\r\nthis period he was twice called out for service upon occasions of war\r\nthreatening,--in 1787 with France, and in 1790 with Spain; but though in\r\neach case appointed to a ship, the employment went no farther, as\r\nhostilities were timely averted. This protracted withdrawal from active\r\npursuit of his profession, viewed in connection with his prolonged and\r\nefficient service of the twenty following years, may be taken as\r\nindicating two things: first, that to professional excellence once\r\nattained such a break is not as fatal as is commonly argued; and second,\r\nconsidered with his favorable entertainment of Cornwallis's proposal to\r\nexchange into the army, this contentment with shore life during the\r\npeace confirms the remark already made, that, although a thorough\r\nseaman, Saumarez was so incidentally. His quickening interest was in the\r\nmilitary rather than the nautical side of his calling. Pellew, on the\r\ncontrary, now eagerly sought duty at sea, impelled thereto by clear\r\nrestless predilection as well as, possibly, by need of increased income.\r\nIt was during this interval of repose, in 1788, that Saumarez married; a\r\nstep which did not in his case entail the professional deterioration\r\ncharged against it by the cynical criticisms of St. Vincent. At this\r\ntime, also, he made a trip to France, upon the occasion of sinking the\r\nfirst cone of the great Cherbourg breakwater, designed to give the\r\nFrench navy a first-class arsenal upon the Channel,--a purpose which it\r\nnow fulfils. Louis XVI. was present at this ceremony, and treated\r\nSaumarez with much attention. This was the only time that he ever set\r\nfoot upon French soil, although his home was in sight of the coast and\r\nhe spoke the language fluently.\r\n\r\nWhen war with France again began, in 1793, Saumarez was appointed to the\r\nfrigate _Crescent_, of thirty-six guns, with which he served actively in\r\nthe Channel. In her, on the 20th of October, 1793, he succeeded in\r\nintercepting the French frigate _Réunion_, of substantially equal force,\r\nwhich he had learned was in the habit of quitting Cherbourg in pursuit\r\nof British merchant vessels every night, returning in the morning. The\r\nensuing action called for an exhibition of seamanship which showed he\r\nhad not lost aptitude during his retirement. In the beginning he placed\r\nthe _Crescent_ on the weather quarter of the French ship,--that is, on\r\nthe windward side, but a little to the rear. This was well judged,\r\nbecause (1) the all-important rudder is thus less exposed, (2) in case\r\nof an unfavorable accident the adversary tends to leave rather than to\r\napproach, and (3) the vessel, moving ahead, is at once under command to\r\nstop short of the opponent. After being placed, speed was regulated by\r\nbacking or filling the mizzen-topsail, thus maintaining the relative\r\npositions, and directing fire upon the enemy's rudder. In this situation\r\nthe fore-topsail yard and foretopmast of the _Crescent_ were shot away\r\nin quick succession, and the ship flew up head to wind, bringing all her\r\nsails aback. For a moment she was in an awkward plight, but the\r\n_Réunion_, drawing away, could not rake; and Saumarez, by adroit\r\nmanagement of the rudder and sails, _backed_ his ship round,--always a\r\nnice operation and especially when near an enemy,--till the wind came\r\nagain abaft, restoring the normal conditions of moving ahead under\r\ncontrol of the helm. The contest was then renewed, and ended in the\r\nsurrender of the French vessel. The disparity of loss--1 British to 118\r\nFrench--proved the discipline of the _Crescent_ and the consummate\r\nseamanship of her commander. For this exploit Saumarez was knighted.\r\nFaithful to his constant preference, he as soon as possible exchanged\r\ninto a ship-of-the-line, the _Orion_, of seventy-four guns. In her he\r\nagain bore a foremost part, in 1795, in a fleet-battle off the Biscay\r\ncoast of France, where three enemy's ships were taken; and two years\r\nlater he was in the action with the Spaniards off Cape St. Vincent, of\r\nwhich an account has been given in the sketch of Earl St. Vincent. After\r\nthis Saumarez remained on the same station, blockading Cadiz.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1798, it became necessary to send a small\r\ndetachment into the Mediterranean, and off the chief arsenal of the\r\nenemy, Toulon, to ascertain the facts concerning a great armament, since\r\nknown as Bonaparte's Egyptian expedition, which rumor said was there in\r\npreparation. The hazardous nature of the duty, which advanced three\r\nships of medium size, unsupported, in the very teeth of over a dozen\r\nenemies, many of superior strength, demanded the utmost efficiency in\r\neach member of the little body so exposed; a consideration which\r\ndoubtless led Lord St. Vincent to choose Saumarez, though one of the\r\nsenior captains, for this service, of which Nelson, the junior flag\r\nofficer of the fleet, was given charge.\r\n\r\nIt seems scarcely credible that, when it was afterwards decided to raise\r\nthis detachment to fourteen ships-of-the-line, sufficient to cope with\r\nthe enemy, both St. Vincent and Nelson wished to remove Saumarez, with\r\nhis antecedents of brilliant service, so as to allow Troubridge, his\r\njunior, to be second in command. The fact, however, is certain. Nelson\r\nhad orders which would have allowed him to send the _Orion_ back, when\r\nthus proceeding on a service pregnant with danger and distinction, to\r\nthe immeasurable humiliation of her brave commander. After making every\r\ndeduction for the known partiality for Troubridge of both St. Vincent\r\nand Nelson, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Saumarez, with\r\nall his undoubted merit, was in their eyes inferior to Troubridge in the\r\nqualities necessary to chief command, in case of Nelson's death, at a\r\njuncture which called for the highest abilities of a general officer.\r\nThe moment was too critical to permit mere favoritism to sway two such\r\nmen against their judgment. As it was, however, Nelson felt he could not\r\npart with so efficient a ship; and he therefore contented himself with\r\ngiving Troubridge and Saumarez each a subdivision of four vessels,\r\nkeeping six under his own immediate direction.\r\n\r\nAs all know, the French, when found, were at anchor. Thus surprised, the\r\nBritish fleet was hurled at them in a single mass; nor was there any\r\nsubordinate command exercised, by Saumarez or any other, except that of\r\neach captain over his particular ship. Nelson's first expectation was to\r\novertake the unwieldy numbers of the enemy, amounting to over four\r\nhundred sail, at sea, and there to destroy both convoy and escort. In\r\nsuch an encounter there would be inestimable tactical advantage in those\r\ncompact subdivisions, which could be thrown as units, under a single\r\nhead, in a required direction. For such a charge Saumarez possessed most\r\neminent capacity.\r\n\r\nThe warm family affection that was among the many winning traits of\r\nSaumarez's symmetrical and attractive character impelled him to copious\r\nletter-writing. Hence we have a record of this pursuit of the French\r\nfleet, with almost daily entries; an inside picture, reflecting the\r\nhopes, fears, and perplexities of the squadron. Bonaparte's enterprise\r\nhas been freely condemned in later days as chimerical; but it did not so\r\nappear at the time to the gallant seamen who frustrated it. The\r\npreparations had been so shrouded in mystery that neither Nelson nor his\r\ngovernment had any certainty as to its destination,--an ignorance\r\nshared by most of the prominent French officials. When, after many\r\nsurmises, the truth gradually transpired, the British officers realized\r\nthat much time must yet elapse before the English ministry could know\r\nit. Two months, for instance, passed before news of the Battle of the\r\nNile reached London. Then, if India were the ultimate object, to which\r\nEgypt was but the stepping-stone, four months more, at least, would be\r\nneeded to get a naval reinforcement to the threatened point. What if,\r\nmeanwhile, the ally of France in the peninsula, Tippoo Saib, had been\r\nassembling transports with the secrecy observed at Toulon and the other\r\nports whence the divisions had sailed? \"I dined with Sir Horatio\r\nto-day,\" writes Saumarez on June 15th, nearly four weeks after\r\nBonaparte's starting, \"and find that his intelligence extends only to\r\nthe enemy's fleet having been seen off Sicily; but we have reason to\r\nsuppose them gone for Alexandria, the distance from which to the Red Sea\r\nis only three days' journey. They may soon be transported thence by\r\nwater to the East Indies, with the assistance of Tippoo Saib; and with\r\ntheir numerous army they expect to drive us out of our possessions in\r\nIndia. This profound scheme, _which is thought very feasible_, we hope\r\nto frustrate by coming up with them before they reach the place of their\r\ndestination.\" A week later, Nelson received off Sicily news of the\r\nsurrender of Malta to the French. In accordance with the views above\r\nexpressed, Sir James now--June 22d--gave Nelson his written opinion,\r\nfavoring the course adopted of seeking the enemy off the coast of Egypt;\r\none of the most responsible decisions ever taken by an admiral in chief\r\ncommand, especially at the beginning of a career, as Nelson then was.\r\n\"We are now crowding sail for Alexandria; but it is very doubtful if we\r\nfall in with them at all, as we are proceeding on the merest conjecture,\r\nand not on any positive information. If, at the end of our journey, we\r\nfind we are upon the wrong scent, our embarrassment will be great\r\nindeed. Fortunately, I only act here _en second_; but did the chief\r\nresponsibility rest with me, I fear it would be more than my too\r\nirritable nerves would bear.\" Nelson, in truth, was passing these hours\r\nin a fever of anxiety, scarce able to eat or drink. Yet at that very\r\nmoment the British were crossing the enemy's wake, unseeing and unseen,\r\nand barely fifty miles separated the two fleets.\r\n\r\nThe perplexity foreshadowed by Saumarez actually fell upon the English\r\nadmiral, through his reaching Alexandria three days before the French.\r\nHarassed out of his better judgment, he hurried back to the westward,\r\ntouched at Sicily, and thence once more to Egypt. Meantime, the French\r\nhad landed successfully. On the 1st of August the British fleet again\r\nsighted Alexandria; saw the French flag on the walls, but no ships of\r\nwar. \"When the reconnoitring squadron made the signal that the enemy\r\nwas not there,\" wrote Saumarez, \"despondency nearly took possession of\r\nmy mind, and I do not remember ever to have felt so utterly hopeless or\r\nout of spirits as when we sat down to dinner. Judge, then, what a change\r\ntook place when, as the cloth was being removed, the officer of the\r\nwatch hastily came in, saying, 'Sir, a signal is just now made that the\r\nenemy is in Aboukir Bay, and moored in a line of battle.' All sprang\r\nfrom their seats, and, only staying to drink a bumper to our success, we\r\nwere in a moment on deck.\" As the captain appeared, the crew hailed him\r\nwith three hearty cheers, a significant token of the gloom which had\r\nwrapped the entire squadron through the recent ordeal of suspense and\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nIt is only with Saumarez's share in this renowned battle that we are\r\nhere concerned. As is generally known, Nelson's tactics consisted in\r\ndoubling upon the van and centre of the enemy, who lay at anchor in a\r\ncolumn head to wind, or nearly so. Their rear, being to leeward, was\r\nthus thrown out of action. The French had thirteen ships-of-the-line, of\r\nwhich one was of one hundred and twenty guns, and two eighties. The\r\nBritish also had thirteen, all seventy-fours, and one of fifty guns; but\r\none of the former going aground left them equal in numbers and inferior\r\nin force. There were two successive acts in the drama. In the first, ten\r\nBritish ships engaged the eight leading French; in the second, the\r\nfifty and two of the seventy-fours, which had been belated, came upon\r\nthe field and strengthened the attack upon the enemy's centre. The\r\n_Orion_, being third in the order, was one of the five vessels which\r\npassed within the French, and fought on that side. In so doing, she\r\ndescribed a wide sweep around her two predecessors. While thus standing\r\ndown to her station, an enemy's frigate, the _Sérieuse_, opened fire\r\nupon her, wounding two men. It was then part of the chivalrous comity of\r\nfleet-actions that frigates should not be molested by the\r\nships-of-the-line, so long as they minded their own business,--an\r\nimmunity which of course ceased if they became aggressive. Saumarez was\r\nurged to return her fire. \"No,\" he replied, \"let her alone; she will get\r\nbolder and come nearer. Shorten sail.\" She did draw nearer, and then the\r\n_Orion_, swinging sharply towards her, let drive her broadside of\r\ndouble-shotted guns. All the masts of the unlucky frigate went\r\noverboard, and she shortly sank, nothing but her poop being visible the\r\nnext day. The helm of the British vessel was then shifted, but so much\r\nground had been lost that she could anchor only abreast the fifth French\r\nship; the interval left being filled by those who followed. In this\r\nposition the _Orion_ silenced her immediate opponent, the _Peuple\r\nSouverain_, which, being in an hour and a half totally dismasted, cut\r\nher cables and dropped out of the line; the contest being then\r\ncontinued with the sixth in the French order, the _Franklin_, next ahead\r\nof the flag-ship, _Orient_. The _Orion_ was thus near by the latter when\r\nshe blew up, but the few burning fragments which fell on board were\r\nquickly extinguished.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours after the battle, Saumarez, who had been delayed till\r\nthen by a severe wound from a splinter, went on board the flag-ship to\r\ncall on the admiral; and to this visit we owe the knowledge of two\r\nclosely related incidents, recorded by his biographer and friend, which\r\nare significant at once of his individual ideas on tactical combination,\r\nand of the lack of personal sympathy apparent between him and Nelson. He\r\n\"found several of his brother officers on the quarter-deck, discussing\r\nthe merits of the action. Some regret having been expressed at the\r\nescape of the two sternmost ships of the French line, Sir James said to\r\nthe admiral, 'It was unfortunate we did not--' and was proceeding to say\r\n'all anchor on the same side.' But, before he could finish the sentence,\r\nNelson hastily interrupted him, exclaiming, 'Thank God there was no\r\norder!' Then turning the conversation, he entered his cabin and sent for\r\nCaptain Ball.... We may relate the circumstances which induced Saumarez,\r\nwithout the least intention to offend, to make the observation at which\r\noffence was taken. It was Nelson's custom, when in communication or\r\ncompany with the captains under his command, to converse with them on\r\nthe various modes of attacking the enemy under different circumstances;\r\nand, on one of these occasions, Sir James Saumarez, who had seen the\r\nevil consequences of _doubling_ on the enemy, especially in a night\r\naction, had differed with the admiral in that plan of attack, saying\r\nthat 'it never required two English ships to capture one French, and\r\nthat the damage which they must necessarily do each other might render\r\nthem both unable to fight an enemy's ship that had not been engaged;\r\nand, as in this case two ships could be spared to the three-decker,\r\neveryone might have his opponent.'\"\r\n\r\nInasmuch as Nelson, in pursuance of his previously announced idea, had\r\nhimself in the flag-ship--the sixth to enter action--set the example of\r\n_doubling_, by anchoring on the side of the enemy's line opposite to\r\nthat of his first five ships, and in doing so had deliberately taken\r\nposition on one side of a French vessel already engaged on the other,\r\nSaumarez's remark was substantially a censure, inopportune to a degree\r\nsingular in a man of his kindly and generous temper; and its reception\r\nby Nelson is not a cause for surprise. On the other hand, as a matter of\r\ntactical criticism, based upon tactical conceptions previously adopted,\r\nif we assume it to be true that two British ships were not needed to\r\ncapture one French, it may yet be confidently affirmed that to attack\r\nwith decisively superior force a part of the enemy's order--to combine\r\nin short--is shown by experience to attain the same degree of success\r\nmore certainly and at less cost than the simple distribution of effort\r\nadvocated by Saumarez. To double, and to beat in detail, remained the\r\nideal of Nelson, as it had been of Howe. It was by him applied then and\r\nafterwards to all cases, small or great, actual or supposed. To it he\r\nchiefly owed his dazzling successes, and this divergence of ideals marks\r\nthe difference in professional insight which mainly determines the\r\nrelative positions of Nelson and Saumarez in naval biography. It\r\nindicates the distinction between the great general officer and the\r\naccomplished and resolute division or corps commander.\r\n\r\nAt the Battle of the Nile Saumarez received the only wound that ever\r\nfell to him throughout his numerous meetings with the enemy, being\r\nstruck on the thigh and side by a heavy splinter, which had killed two\r\nofficers before reaching him. The total loss of his ship was forty-two\r\nkilled and wounded, out of a crew of six hundred. Ten days after the\r\naction he was ordered to take charge of six of the prizes, which had\r\nbeen partly repaired, and with seven of the fleet to convoy them to\r\nGibraltar. At the same time he was notified that the _Orion_ was to go\r\nhome as soon as this duty was performed. A more charming prospect can\r\nscarcely be imagined than this returning to his family after a long\r\nabsence, fresh from the completest achievement ever wrought by the\r\nBritish navy; but even his tranquil temper, whose expressions never\r\nlapse into the complaints of Nelson or the querulousness of Collingwood,\r\nwas tried by the slow progress of his battered and crippled squadron.\r\n\"The prizes get on very slowly,\" he writes; \"but I am endowed with\r\nunparalleled patience, having scarcely uttered a murmur at their\r\ntardiness, so perfectly satisfied am I with the prospect before me.\"\r\nSome time later he notes: \"We have been three weeks effecting what might\r\nbe accomplished in two days. This extraordinary delay makes me more\r\nfractious than can be imagined, and I begin to lose the character for\r\npatience which I had given myself, by so tiresome a situation.\" It was\r\nstill the season of westerly winds, and the voyage from Alexandria to\r\nGibraltar occupied sixty-nine days.\r\n\r\nThe _Orion_ was now completely worn out, having been continuously in\r\ncommission since the war began in 1793. Besides the three general\r\nactions in which Saumarez commanded her, she had borne a valiant part in\r\nHowe's great battle of the 1st of June. \"This last business has so\r\nshattered the poor _Orion_\" wrote Saumarez, \"that she will not, without\r\nconsiderable repairs, be in a state for more service.\" On reaching\r\nEngland she was paid off; and in February, 1799, he was appointed to the\r\n_Cæsar_, of eighty-four guns, one of the finest ships in the navy, which\r\nwas to bear his flag in the last and most brilliant episode of his\r\nhard-fighting career.\r\n\r\nA year later, Lord St. Vincent, having returned from the Mediterranean,\r\ntook command of the Channel Fleet, and at once instituted in its\r\nmethods, and particularly in the blockade of Brest, changes which\r\ngradually revolutionized the character of the general naval war;\r\nbaffling beyond any other single cause the aims of Napoleon, and\r\ninsuring the fall of his empire. One of the new requirements was the\r\nmaintenance of a powerful advanced division of six or eight\r\nships-of-the-line, within ten miles of the harbor's mouth. It was a duty\r\nsingularly arduous, demanding neither dash nor genius, but calmness,\r\nsteadiness, method, and seamanship of a high order, for all which\r\nSaumarez was conspicuous. From either side of the Bay of Brest a long\r\nline of reefs projects for fifteen miles to the westward. Far inside\r\ntheir outer limits, and therefore embayed by the westerly winds which\r\nblow at times with hurricane violence, was the station of the advanced\r\nsquadron, off some well-marked rocks of the northern reef, known as the\r\nBlack Rocks. On this spot, called Siberia by the seamen, during fifteen\r\nweeks, from August to December, Sir James Saumarez kept so close a watch\r\nthat not a vessel of any force entered or left Brest. \"With you there,\"\r\nwrote Earl St. Vincent, \"I sleep as sound as if I had the key of Brest\r\nin my pocket.\" No work ever done by him was more meritorious or more\r\nuseful. Near its expiration St. Vincent wrote to him, \"The employment\r\nyou have conducted is the most important of this war.\" He there\r\ndemonstrated that what before had apparently been thought impossible\r\ncould be done, though involving a degree of anxiety and peril far\r\nexceeding that of battle, while accompanied by none of the distinction,\r\nnor even recognition, which battle bestows. \"None but professional men\r\nwho have been on that service,\" says his biographer with simple truth,\r\n\"can have any idea of its difficulties,--surrounded by dangers of every\r\nkind, exposed to the violence of storms, sailing amidst a multitude of\r\nrocks and variable currents in the longest and darkest nights, and often\r\non a lee shore on the enemy's coast, while the whole of their fleet is\r\nnear, ready to take advantage of any disaster.\" Collingwood, who in the\r\nnext war succeeded to the same unenviable duty, wrote home that, even in\r\nthe summer month of August, \"I bid adieu to comfortable naps at night,\r\nnever lying down but in my clothes. An anxious time I have of it, what\r\nwith tides and rocks, which have more of danger in them than a battle\r\nonce a week.\" In this laborious task Saumarez was the patient,\r\nunobserved pioneer.\r\n\r\nThere was one man, however, who could and did recognize to the full the\r\nquality of the work done by Saumarez, and its value to those sagacious\r\nplans which he himself had framed, and which in the future were to sap\r\nthe foundations of the French power. That man was St. Vincent. \"The\r\nmerit of Sir James Saumarez,\" he said, \"cannot be surpassed;\" and\r\nagain, to Saumarez himself, \"The manner in which you have conducted the\r\nadvanced squadron calls upon me to repeat my admiration of it.\"\r\nSucceeding soon after to the post of First Lord of the Admiralty, he\r\ngave him an opportunity for distinction, which resulted in an action of\r\nsingular lustre and striking success.\r\n\r\nBonaparte, long before returned from Egypt, and now, as First Consul,\r\npractically the absolute ruler of France, had overthrown all enemies on\r\nthe Continent. Peace with Austria, after her disasters of Marengo and\r\nHohenlinden, had been signed in February, 1801. The great objects of the\r\nFrench ruler now were to compass a maritime peace and withal to retain\r\nEgypt, associated from far back with the traditional policies of France,\r\nand moreover a conquest in which his own reputation was peculiarly\r\ninterested. To compel Great Britain to peace, he sought, by diplomacy or\r\nforce, to exclude her commerce from the Continent, as well as to raise\r\nup maritime enemies against her. Thus he had fostered, if not actually\r\nengendered, the Baltic league of 1801, shattered by Nelson at\r\nCopenhagen; and for this purpose he intended to occupy both Portugal and\r\nthe kingdom of Naples. A powerful British expedition against Egypt had\r\nentered the Mediterranean. It was essential either to attack this\r\ndirectly, or to cripple its communications. Unable to do the former,\r\nand persistently thwarted in his attempts to reinforce his own troops in\r\nthat distant dependency by the close watch of the British navy, of which\r\nSaumarez gave so conspicuous an illustration before Brest, Napoleon\r\nresorted to the common and sound military expedient of collecting a\r\nthreatening force upon the flank of his enemy's line of communications.\r\nHe directed a concentration of the Spanish and French navies at Cadiz,\r\nwhich, by its nearness to the straits, met the desired requirement.\r\nAmong others, three French ships were ordered thither from Toulon.\r\n\r\nThe British ministry was informed that at Cadiz were collecting Spanish\r\nvessels, said by report to be intended against Portugal. This is\r\nunlikely, as Bonaparte could have subdued that country from the land\r\nside by the assistance of Spain; moreover, the object of the\r\nconcentration is stated in his letters. A squadron of five\r\nships-of-the-line was accordingly formed, and placed under the command\r\nof Saumarez, who on the 1st of January, 1801, had been made a rear\r\nadmiral. His orders were to go off Cadiz, where he would find two more\r\nvessels, and to prevent the enemies within the port from sailing, or\r\nfrom being joined by any from outside. Whatever Bonaparte's object, it\r\nwould be thwarted by a force thus interposed, in a position to meet\r\neither one or the other of the converging detachments before they could\r\nunite.\r\n\r\nSaumarez sailed on his mission June 16, 1801, and on the 28th arrived\r\noff Cadiz. On the 5th of July he was informed that three French ships\r\nhad anchored off Algeciras, the Spanish port on the west side of\r\nGibraltar Bay, confronting the British fortress on the east side. This\r\nwas the division from Toulon, which upon reaching the straits first\r\nlearned of the British squadron that effectually prevented its entrance\r\nto Cadiz.\r\n\r\nSaumarez at once started for Algeciras with six of his\r\nships-of-the-line, the seventh being out of recall to the northward. The\r\nfollowing day, July 6th, he entered the bay, and found the French moored\r\nin a strong position, under cover of Spanish land batteries, and\r\nsupported by a number of gunboats. Still, though difficult and doubtful,\r\nthe enterprise was not hopeless; and, as the breeze allowed his vessels\r\nto head for the enemy, he steered to engage at once. Unfortunately, the\r\nwind fell as the squadron drew nigh, and only four ships were able to\r\ntake their intended places; the other two had to anchor outside their\r\nconsorts, and fire as they could through the intervals. This mishap\r\nlessened by one-third the fighting power of the British, and, coupled\r\nwith the acknowledged superiority of guns on solid ground over those\r\nafloat, reduced them to inferiority. Their disadvantage was increased by\r\nthe arrangements of the French admiral, carefully elaborated during the\r\ntwo preceding days. Had the preparations of Brueys at the Nile equalled\r\nthose of Linois at Algeciras, Nelson's task must have been harder and\r\nhis victory less complete. Nevertheless, after an engagement of an hour\r\nand a half, the British fire so far prevailed that the enemy resorted to\r\na measure for which precautions had been taken beforehand. Lines had\r\nbeen run from each French ship to the shoal water lying close inside\r\nthem; and by means of these they were warped away from their opponents\r\nuntil they took the ground. This increase of distance was in every way a\r\ngain to the party standing on the defensive, and a corresponding loss to\r\nthe assailants. Saumarez ordered the cables cut and sail made to close\r\nonce more; but the light and fickle airs both baffled this effort and\r\nfurther embarrassed the British, through the difficulty of keeping their\r\nbroadsides in position. Here happened the great disaster of the day. One\r\nof the outer ships, the _Hannibal_, tried to pass inside the headmost of\r\nthe French, not realizing that the latter had moved. In so doing she ran\r\naground close under a battery, to whose fire she could make no reply.\r\nAfter a brave and prolonged resistance, in which she lost seventy-five\r\nkilled and seventy wounded out of a crew of six hundred, and had many of\r\nher guns dismounted, she hauled down her flag. By this time another\r\nship, the _Pompée_, was dismasted, and success was plainly hopeless. The\r\nBritish admiral, therefore, ordered the action discontinued, and\r\nwithdrew to the Gibraltar side; the _Pompée_ having to be towed away by\r\nthe boats of the squadron.\r\n\r\nSaumarez had failed, and failure, however explained, can hardly be\r\ncarried to a man's credit; but his after course, by wresting success out\r\nof seemingly irretrievable disaster, has merited the highest eulogium.\r\nMaintaining both courage and energy unimpaired, every effort was\r\ninstantly made to get the ships once more into fighting condition, that\r\nthe attack might be renewed. \"Tell the Admiralty,\" said he to the bearer\r\nof his despatches, \"that I feel confident I shall soon have an\r\nopportunity of attacking the enemy again, and that they may depend upon\r\nmy availing myself of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe opportunity did come. On the morning of July 9th, the _Superb_, the\r\nseventh ship, which had not been in the action, was seen rounding the\r\nwest point of the bay under all sail, with a signal flying that the\r\nenemy was in pursuit. A few moments later appeared five Spanish vessels,\r\ntwo of which, the _Real Carlos_ and the _Hermenegildo_, carrying each\r\none hundred and twelve guns, were among the largest then afloat. On\r\nboard them had embarked a number of the _jeunesse dorée_ of Cadiz, eager\r\nto join the triumphal procession which it was thought would soon enter\r\nthe port, flushed with a victory considered by them to be rather Spanish\r\nthan French, and escorting the rare trophy of a British ship-of-the-line\r\nthat had struck to Spanish batteries. Besides the two giants, there\r\nwere a ninety-gun ship and two seventy-fours; and the next day a French\r\nvessel of the latter class joined, making a total reinforcement of six\r\nheavy ships.\r\n\r\nTo these Saumarez could oppose but five. The _Hannibal_ he had lost. The\r\n_Pompée_ could not be repaired in time; her people were therefore\r\ndistributed among the other vessels of the squadron. Even his own\r\nflag-ship, the _Cæsar_, was so injured that he thought it impossible to\r\nrefit her; but when her crew heard his decision, one cry arose,--to work\r\nall day and night till she was ready for battle. This was zeal not\r\naccording to knowledge; but, upon the pleading of her captain in their\r\nname, it was agreed that they should work all day, and by watches at\r\nnight. So it happened, by systematic distribution of effort and\r\nenthusiastic labor, that the _Cæsar_, whose mainmast on the 9th was out\r\nand her rigging cut to pieces, was on the 12th able to sail in pursuit\r\nof the foe.\r\n\r\nDuring the forenoon of the latter day the combined squadron was seen\r\ngetting under way. The wind, being easterly, was fair for the British,\r\nand, besides, compelled the enemy to make some tacks to clear the land.\r\nThis delay was invaluable to Saumarez, whose preparations, rapid as they\r\nhad been, were still far from complete. Not till one in the afternoon\r\ndid the headmost Spaniards reach the straits, and there they had to\r\nawait their companions. The _Hannibal_ was unable to join them, and\r\nreanchored at Algeciras. At half-past two the _Cæsar_ hauled out from\r\nGibraltar mole, her band playing, \"Cheer up, my lads, 't is to glory we\r\nsteer!\" which was answered from the mole-head with \"Britons, strike\r\nhome!\" At the same moment Saumarez's flag, provisionally shifted to\r\nanother vessel, was rehoisted at her masthead. The rugged flanks of the\r\nrock and the shores of Algeciras were crowded with eager and cheering\r\nsight-seers, whose shouts echoed back the hurrahs of the seamen. Rarely,\r\nindeed, is so much of the pride and circumstance, if not of the pomp, of\r\nwar rehearsed before an audience which, breathless with expectation, has\r\nin it no part save to admire and applaud.\r\n\r\nOff Europa Point, on the Gibraltar side, there clustered round the\r\n_Cæsar_ her four consorts, all but one bearing, like herself, the still\r\nfresh wounds of the recent conflict. Four miles away, off Cabrita Point,\r\nassembled the three French of Linois's division, having like honorable\r\nmarks, together with the six new unscarred arrivals. At 8 P.M. of the\r\nsummer evening the allies kept away for Cadiz; Linois's division\r\nleading, the other six interposing between them and the five ships of\r\nSaumarez, which followed at once. It was a singular sight, this pursuit\r\nof nine ships by five, suggestive of much of the fatal difference, in\r\nideals and efficiency, between the navies concerned. Towards nine\r\no'clock Saumarez ordered the _Superb_, whose condition alone was\r\nunimpaired by battle, to press ahead and bring the rear of the enemy to\r\naction. The wind was blowing strong from the east, with a heavy sea. At\r\nhalf-past eleven the _Superb_ overtook the _Real Carlos_, and opened\r\nfire. Abreast the Spanish vessel, on her other side, was the\r\n_Hermenegildo_. The latter, probably through receiving some of the\r\n_Superb's_ shot, fancied the ship nearest her to be an enemy, and\r\nreplied. In the confusion, one of them caught fire, the other ran on\r\nboard her, and in a few moments there was presented to the oncoming\r\nBritish the tremendous sight of these two huge ships, with their twenty\r\nhundred men, locked in a fast embrace and blazing together. At half-past\r\ntwo in the morning, having by that time drifted apart, they blew up in\r\nquick succession.\r\n\r\nLeaving them to their fate, the hostile squadron passed on. The _Superb_\r\nnext encountered the _St. Antoine_, and forced her to strike. Soon\r\nafterwards the wind died away, and both fleets were much scattered. A\r\nBritish ship brought to action one of the French which had been in the\r\nfirst battle; indeed, the French accounts say that the latter had fought\r\nthree enemies. However that may be, she was again severely mauled; but\r\nthe English vessel opposed to her ran on a shoal, and lost all her\r\nmasts. With this ended the events of that awful night.\r\n\r\nThe net results of this stirring week completely relieved the fears of\r\nthe British ministers. Whatever the objects of the concentration at\r\nCadiz, they were necessarily frustrated. Though the first attack was\r\nrepulsed, the three French ships had been very roughly handled; and, of\r\nthe relieving force, three out of six were now lost to the enemy. \"Sir\r\nJames Saumarez's action has put us upon velvet,\" wrote St. Vincent, then\r\nhead of the Admiralty; and in the House of Peers he highly eulogized the\r\nadmiral's conduct, as also did Nelson. The former declared that \"this\r\ngallant achievement surpassed everything he had ever met with in his\r\nreading or service,\" a statement sufficiently sweeping; while the praise\r\nof the hero of the Nile was the more to be prized because there never\r\nwas cordial sympathy between him and Saumarez. Closely as they had been\r\nassociated, Nelson's letters to his brother officer began always \"My\r\ndear Sir James,\" not \"My dear Saumarez.\"\r\n\r\nIn this blaze of triumph the story of Saumarez fitly terminates. He was\r\nnever again engaged in serious encounter with the enemy. The first war\r\nwith the French republic ended three months after the battle of\r\nAlgeciras. After the second began, in 1803, he was, until 1807,\r\ncommander-in-chief at the Channel Islands, watching the preparations for\r\nthe invasion of England, and counteracting the efforts of cruisers\r\nagainst British commerce. In 1808, in consequence of the agreements of\r\nTilsit between the Czar and Napoleon, affairs in the Baltic became such\r\nas to demand the presence of a large British fleet,--first to support\r\nSweden, then at war with Russia, and later to protect the immense\r\nBritish trade, which, under neutral flags and by contraband methods,\r\nmaintained by way of the northern sea the intercourse of Great Britain\r\nwith the Continent. Of this trade Sweden was an important intermediary,\r\nand her practical neutrality was essential to its continuance. This was\r\ninsured by the firm yet moderate attitude of Sir James Saumarez, even\r\nwhen she had been forced by France to declare war against Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIt may be said without exaggeration that from this time, and until the\r\nbreach between Napoleon and Russia in 1812, the maritime interest of the\r\nwar between Great Britain and France centred in the Baltic. Elsewhere\r\nthe effective but monotonous blockade of the continental ports\r\ncontrolled by the French Emperor absorbed the attention of the British\r\nfleets. Of great battles there were none after Trafalgar. To Saumarez,\r\ntherefore, fell the most distinctive, and probably also the most\r\ndecisive, field of work open to the British navy. The importance of the\r\nBaltic was twofold. It was then the greatest source of materials\r\nessential to ship-building--commonly called naval stores; and further,\r\nthe Russian part of its coast line, being independent of Napoleon's\r\ndirect regulation, was the chief means of approach by which Great\r\nBritain maintained commercial intercourse with the Continent, to exclude\r\nher from which had become the leading object with the Emperor. The\r\ncontravention of his policy in this way, in disregard, as he claimed, of\r\nthe agreements existing between him and the Czar, led eventually to the\r\nRussian war, and so finally to his own overthrow and the deliverance of\r\nthe Continent from his domination.\r\n\r\nThe historical significance of the position now occupied by Saumarez,\r\nand its importance to the great issues of the future, are thus manifest.\r\nIt was a post that he was eminently qualified to fill. Firm, yet calm,\r\nsagacious, and moderate, he met with rare efficiency the varied and\r\nvarying demands of those changeful times. The unremitting and well\r\ndirected efforts of his cruisers broke up reciprocal commerce between\r\nthe countries surrounding the narrow inland sea, so essential to their\r\nwelfare while submitting to Napoleon; while the main fleet sustained the\r\nforeign trade with Russia and Sweden, carried on through neutral ships\r\nfor the advantage of Great Britain. Two instances will illustrate his\r\nactivities better than many words. In the year 1809 four hundred and\r\nthirty local vessels were captured, averaging the small size of sixty\r\ntons each, three hundred and forty of which belonged to Denmark, then\r\nunder Napoleon's absolute sway. At the close of the open season of 1810,\r\nthe merchant ships for England, which ordinarily were despatched under\r\nconvoy in bodies of five hundred, numbered, according to Saumarez's\r\nflag-lieutenant and biographer, no less than one thousand vessels,\r\ngathered in one mass.\r\n\r\nAs long as Sweden remained friendly, the admiral's duties, though\r\nweighty, did not differ materially from those usual to his profession;\r\nbut when she was unwillingly forced into a declaration of war by\r\nNapoleon, his task became more complicated and more delicate. The\r\nBritish minister having to leave, Saumarez succeeded to a diplomatic\r\nsituation, in which the problem was to support the interests and dignity\r\nof his own nation, without transforming the formal war into actual\r\nhostilities, and substituting imbitterment for the secret good will of\r\nthe Swedish government and people, who, in common with the Russian\r\nnobles and subjects, were alienated by the imperious and merciless\r\nexactions of the French demands. The secret aim of Great Britain was so\r\nto nourish this ill-will towards France, and so to avoid causes of\r\noffence by herself, as to convert covert hostility into open antagonism,\r\nand thus to reverse the political and military combinations of Europe.\r\nIn the absence of regular accredited diplomatic representatives,\r\nSaumarez became at once the exponent and the minister of this vital\r\npolicy. He had to avoid quarrels, and yet at the same time to restrain\r\nSweden from acts of injury to which she was constantly impelled by the\r\nEmperor, whose purpose naturally was exactly the opposite of his; and\r\nwho sought further to estrange all people from Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of this task Saumarez's success was not only\r\ncomplete, but peculiarly his own. His temper was at times severely\r\ntried, but it never got beyond his control. He repressed injury, and\r\ndemanded satisfaction for it, when committed; but, relying with good\r\nreason on the motives of the Swedish government, he contrived to secure\r\nredress without resorting to force, which, however understood by\r\nstatesmen, would enrage the peoples he had to conciliate. After the\r\nordeal was over, and Russia was at war with France, a leading Swedish\r\nstatesman wrote to him: \"You have been the guardian angel of my country;\r\nby your wise, temperate, and loyal conduct, you have been the first\r\ncause of the plans which have been formed against the demon of the\r\ncontinent.... Once more I must tell you, that _you_ were the first cause\r\nthat Russia had dared to make war against France; had you fired one\r\nshot when we declared war against England, all had been ended and Europe\r\nwould have been enslaved.\" Saumarez, an extremely religious man, may\r\nhave reflected that \"he who ruleth his spirit is greater than he that\r\ntaketh a city.\"\r\n\r\nThough in the strictest sense professional, the Baltic service of\r\nSaumarez involved little of purely military interest. Shortly after his\r\nassuming the command, in 1808, a Russian fleet which had been keeping\r\nthe sea took refuge, on the approach of the allied British and Swedes,\r\nin a harbor on the Gulf of Finland. Saumarez followed close upon their\r\nheels, and after a consultation and reconnoissance of the position,\r\nwhich consumed two days, secured the co-operation of the Swedish admiral\r\nfor an attack on the day following; an essential condition, for the\r\nRussian force was superior to his own in the proportion of eight to six.\r\nUnhappily, the wind shifted, and blew an adverse gale for eight days; at\r\nthe end of which time the enemy had so far fortified the surroundings\r\nthat Saumarez thought it inexpedient to attack. In this decision he was\r\nsupported by the opinion of captains of such established reputation as,\r\njoined to his own brilliant record, must be taken to justify his action,\r\nwhich seems to have caused some dissatisfaction in England. On the face,\r\nit could not but be a disappointment to people accustomed to the\r\nbrilliant victories of Nelson, and his apparent invincibility by\r\nobstacles; but in the end it was all for the best, for doubtless the\r\nmortifying destruction of a Russian fleet would not have furthered the\r\nreconciliation, which soon became a leading object with the British\r\ngovernment and the great bulk of the Russian nation. It is, however,\r\nprobable that to this frustration of public expectation, which had been\r\nvividly aroused by preceding accounts of the conditions, is to be\r\nattributed the delay in granting the peerage, eagerly desired by\r\nSaumarez in his later days,--not for itself merely, but as a recognition\r\nwhich he not unnaturally thought earned by his long and distinguished\r\nservice. Saumarez held the Baltic command through five eventful\r\nyears,--from 1808 to 1812. After Napoleon's disastrous Russian\r\nexpedition, affairs in that sea no longer required a force adequate to\r\nhis rank, and he then finally retired from service afloat, still in the\r\nfull maturity of a healthy prime, at the age of fifty-five. The\r\nremainder of his life, with brief exception, was passed in his native\r\nisland of Guernsey, amid those charms of family affection and general\r\nesteem which he had deserved by his fidelity to all the duties of the\r\nman and the citizen. Though so far removed from the active centres of\r\nlife, he kept touch with it by the variety of his interests in all\r\nuseful and benevolent undertakings, to which an ample fortune allowed\r\nhim freely to contribute. \"The hopes entertained of his assistance and\r\nsympathy,\" observes his biographer, \"were never disappointed.\" Among\r\nnaval biographies, there is none that presents a more pleasing picture\r\nof genial and dignified enjoyment of well-earned repose. In 1831, upon\r\nthe accession of William IV., the Sailor King, the long-coveted peerage\r\nwas at last bestowed. Lord de Saumarez died on the 9th of October, 1836,\r\nin his eightieth year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPELLEW\r\n\r\n1757-1833\r\n\r\n\r\nLike the English tongue itself, the names of British seamen show the\r\ncomposite origin of their nation. As the Danes after the day of\r\nCopenhagen, to them both glorious and disastrous, claimed that in Nelson\r\nthey had been vanquished by a man of their own blood, descended from\r\ntheir Viking forefathers; as Collingwood and Troubridge indicate the\r\nEnglish descent of the two closest associates of the victor of\r\nTrafalgar; so Saumarez and the hero of this sketch, whose family name\r\nwas Pellew, represent that conquering Norman race which from the shores\r\nof the Northern ocean carried terror along the coasts of Europe and the\r\nMediterranean, and as far inland as their light keels could enter. After\r\nthe great wars of the French Revolution and the Battle of Algiers, when\r\nLord Exmouth had won his renown and his position had been attained,\r\nkinship with him was claimed by a family still residing in Normandy,\r\nwhere the name was spelled \"Pelleu.\" Proof of common origin was offered,\r\nnot only in the name, but also in the coat of arms. In England, the\r\nPellew family was settled in the extreme southwest, in Cornwall and\r\nDevonshire, counties whose nearness to the great Atlantic made them the\r\nsource of so much of the maritime enterprise that marked the reign of\r\nElizabeth. Lord Exmouth's grandfather was a man of wealth; but, as he\r\nleft many children, the juniors had to shift for themselves, and the\r\nyoungest son, Samuel Pellew, the father of the admiral, at the time of\r\nthe latter's birth commanded a post-office packet on the Dover station.\r\nHe accordingly made the town of that name the home of his wife and\r\nchildren; and there Edward, the second of his four sons, was born, April\r\n19, 1757. Their mother was the daughter of a Jacobite gentleman, who had\r\nbeen out for the Pretender in 1715,--a fact which probably emphasized\r\nthe strong Hanoverian sympathies of Samuel Pellew, whose habit was to\r\nmake his children, every Sunday, drink King George's health upon their\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nIn 1765, when the future admiral was only eight years old, his father\r\ndied, and the mother making an imprudent marriage three years later, the\r\nchildren were thrown upon the world with small provision and scanty\r\ncare. The resolute, active, and courageous character of the lads,\r\nhowever, brought them well forward among their equals in age. At school\r\nEdward was especially distinguished for fearlessness. Of this he gave a\r\nmarked instance, when not yet twelve, by entering a burning house where\r\ngunpowder was stored, which no other of the bystanders would approach.\r\nAlone and with his own hands the lad brought out the powder. A less\r\ncommendable but very natural result of the same energetic spirit was\r\nshown in the numerous fighting matches in which he was engaged. Being\r\nthreatened with a flogging for one of these, the circumstance became the\r\nimmediate occasion of his going to sea. If flogged, he declared, he\r\nwould run away; and as a decided taste for seafaring life had already\r\nmanifested itself, his guardian thought better to embrace at once the\r\nmore favorable alternative and enter him regularly in the navy. He thus\r\nwent afloat towards the end of 1770, the date at which Nelson, also,\r\nthough one year younger, began his career.\r\n\r\nHis first cruise was in the Mediterranean. It came to a premature end\r\nthrough a quarrel between the commander of the ship and one of the\r\nmidshipmen. In this the captain was clearly and grossly in the wrong;\r\nyet nevertheless carried his resentment, and the power of oppression in\r\nhis hands, then little restrained by law, so far as to expel the\r\nyoungster from the ship and set him on shore in Marseilles. Pellew\r\ninsisted upon accompanying his messmate, and the two lads of fourteen,\r\naided by some of the lieutenants, secured a passage home. It shows a\r\npleasing trait in our hero's character that, some years afterwards, he\r\nadvanced materially the professional fortunes of the son of the officer\r\nwho had thus abused his authority.\r\n\r\nHe next passed under the command of a Captain Pownoll, between whom and\r\nhimself were established such warm relations, of affectionate interest\r\non the one side and reverential regard on the other, that Pownoll became\r\na family name among the descendants of the admiral. He himself gave it\r\nto his first-born, and it still appears in the present generation. Under\r\nhim, also, Pellew was brought into direct contact with the American\r\nRevolution; for on board the frigate _Blonde_, Pownoll's ship, General\r\nBurgoyne embarked in 1775 for Canada, there beginning the undertaking\r\nwhich ended so disastrously for him. It is told that when the\r\ndistinguished passenger came on board, the yards being manned to receive\r\nhim with the honors due to his rank, he was startled to see on one\r\nyardarm a midshipman standing on his head. Upon expressing alarm, he was\r\nlaughingly reassured by the captain, who said that Pellew--for he it was\r\nwho put this extra touch upon the general's reception--was quite capable\r\nof dropping from the yard, passing under the ship's bottom, and coming\r\nup on the other side. A few days later the young officer actually did\r\nleap from the yardarm, the ship going fast through the water--not,\r\nhowever, as bravado, but to aid a seaman who had fallen overboard, and\r\nwhom he succeeded in saving.\r\n\r\nThroughout his youth the exuberant vitality of the man delighted in\r\nthese feats of wanton power. To overturn a boat by press of canvas, as a\r\nfrolic, is not unexampled among lads of daring; but it is at least\r\nunusual, when a hat goes overboard, to follow it into the water, if\r\nalone in a boat under sail. This Pellew did, on one occasion, when he\r\nwas old enough to know better; being at the moment in the open Channel,\r\nin a small punt, going from Falmouth to Plymouth. The freak nearly cost\r\nhim his life; for, though he had lashed the helm down and hove-to the\r\nboat, she fell off and gathered way whenever he approached. When at last\r\nhe laid hold of her rail, after an hour of this fooling, barely strength\r\nremained to drag himself on board, where he fell helpless, and waited\r\nlong before his powers were restored. It is trite to note in such\r\nexhibitions of recklessness many of the qualities of the ideal seaman,\r\nthough not so certainly those of the foreordained commander-in-chief.\r\nPellew was a born frigate captain.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1775 the Americans were still engaged in the enterprise\r\nagainst Quebec, the disastrous termination of which is familiarly known.\r\nAfter the fall of General Montgomery in the unsuccessful night assault\r\nof December 31, 1775, the American operations were reduced to a land\r\nblockade of the town, which was cut off from the sea by ice in the\r\nriver. A close investment was thus maintained for five months, until\r\nthe early part of May, 1776, when the place was relieved by the arrival\r\nof a small naval force, commanded by Captain Charles Douglas.\r\nImmediately upon its appearance the commanding British general Carleton,\r\nattacked the besiegers, who, already prostrated by disease and\r\nprivation, abandoned their positions and fell back upon Sorel, at the\r\nmouth of the river Richelieu, the outlet from Lake Champlain to the St.\r\nLawrence. Here they remained until June, when the enemy, who had\r\nreceived heavy reinforcements, advanced in overpowering numbers. The\r\nAmericans again retired above the rapids of the Richelieu to St. Johns.\r\nThence there is a clear channel southward; and embarking there, the\r\nretreating force without further molestation reached Crown Point, a\r\nfortified post a hundred miles distant, at the head of the lake,\r\ncommanding the narrow stream to which it is reduced in its upper part.\r\nTwelve miles above Crown Point is Ticonderoga, the well-known border\r\nfortress of the Colonial and Revolutionary wars; and for fifteen or\r\ntwenty miles farther the stream is navigable for boats of some size,\r\nthus affording an easy means of communication in those early days of\r\nimpassable forests and scanty transport.\r\n\r\nThough greatly superior on land, the British had now for a time to stay\r\ntheir pursuit; for the water highway essential to its continuance was\r\ncontrolled by the flotilla under the command of Benedict Arnold,\r\nforbidding further advance until it was subdued. The presence of these\r\nvessels, which, though few, were as yet unopposed, gained for the\r\nAmericans, in this hour of extremity, the important respite from June to\r\nOctober, 1776; and then the lateness of the season compelled the\r\npostponement of the invasion to the following year. The toil with which\r\nthis little force had been created, a few months before, was thus amply\r\njustified; for delay is ever to the advantage of the defence. In this\r\ncase it also gave time for a change of commanders on the part of the\r\nenemy, from Carleton to Burgoyne, which not improbably had a decisive\r\neffect upon the fortunes of the next campaign.\r\n\r\nAs soon as established at St. Johns, the British took steps to place a\r\nnaval force upon the lake, an undertaking involving trouble and delay,\r\nnotwithstanding their greatly superior resources in men and material.\r\nSome thirty fighting vessels, suitable to the waters upon which they\r\nwere to act, were required, and also four hundred bateaux for the\r\ntransport of the troops. These had either to be built upon the spot,\r\ndespite the lack of all dockyard facilities, or else to be brought\r\nbodily from the St. Lawrence, by road, or through the rapids of the\r\nRichelieu, until the deep water at St. Johns was reached. In this hardy,\r\nstrenuous work, Pellew naturally was conspicuously active; and in its\r\ncourse he gained a particular professional accomplishment which\r\nafterwards stood him in good stead. Several vessels were built upon the\r\nshores of the stream; among others, one of one hundred and eighty tons,\r\nthe _Inflexible_, whose heavier timbers were brought overland to St.\r\nJohns. The construction of these craft was superintended by a\r\nlieutenant--afterwards Admiral Schank--of scientific knowledge as a ship\r\narchitect; and through close association with him Pellew's instinctive\r\nappreciation of all things nautical received an intelligent guidance,\r\nwhich gave him a quick insight into the probable behavior of a ship from\r\nan examination of her build, and enabled him often to suggest a suitable\r\nremedy for dangerous faults. During this period of equipment occurred a\r\ncharacteristic incident which has only recently become public through a\r\ndescendant.[15] \"On the day the _Inflexible_ was launched, Pellew on the\r\ntop of the sheers was trying to get in the mainmast. The machinery not\r\nbeing of the best gave way, and down came mainmast, Pellew, and all,\r\ninto the lake. 'Poor Pellew,' exclaimed Schank, 'he is gone at last!'\r\nHowever, he speedily emerged and was the first man to mount the sheers\r\nagain. 'Sir,' Admiral Schank used to conclude, 'he was like a\r\nsquirrel.'\"\r\n\r\nThirty days after the keel of the _Inflexible_ was laid at St. Johns,\r\nthe vessel herself not only was launched, but had set sail for the\r\nsouthward. She carried eighteen twelve-pounders, nine on a side, and was\r\nthus superior in power, not only to any one vessel of the Americans, but\r\nto their whole assembled flotilla on Lake Champlain. Except the\r\nprincipal pieces of her hull, the timber of which she was built was\r\nhewed in the neighboring forest; and indeed, the whole story of the\r\nrapid equipment of this squadron recalls vividly the vigorous\r\npreparation of Commander Perry, of the United States navy, in 1813, for\r\nhis successful attempt to control Lake Erie. The entire British force,\r\nland and naval, now moved toward Crown Point. On the 11th of October the\r\nAmerican flotilla was discovered, a short distance above Plattsburg and\r\nabout twenty miles from the foot of the lake, drawn up between Valcour\r\nIsland and the western shore, which are from one-half to three-fourths\r\nof a mile apart. It lay there so snugly that the British, wafted by a\r\nnorthwest wind, had actually passed to the southward without seeing it,\r\nand the discovery was purely accidental,--a fact which suggests that\r\nArnold, who must have felt the impossibility of a force so inferior as\r\nhis own contesting, or even long delaying, the enemy's advance by direct\r\nopposition, may have entertained some purpose of operating in their\r\nrear, and thus causing a diversion which at this late season might\r\neffectually arrest their progress. It is true that such a stroke would\r\nfrightfully imperil his little squadron; but, in circumstances of\r\nabsolute inferiority, audacity, usually the best policy in war, offers\r\nthe only chance of success. Mere retreat, however methodical, must end\r\nin final destruction. To act towards St. Johns, trusting to dexterity\r\nand to local knowledge of the network of islands at the foot of the lake\r\nto escape disaster, or at least to protract the issue, offered the best\r\nchance; and that the situation thus accepted would not be hopeless was\r\nproved by the subsequent temporary evasion of pursuit by the Americans,\r\neven in the open and narrow water of the middle lake.\r\n\r\nThe British moved to attack as soon as the hostile shipping was\r\ndiscovered. Pellew was second officer of the schooner _Carleton_, of\r\ntwelve guns, the third vessel of the flotilla in point of force. The\r\nwind being contrary, and apparently light, the _Carleton_ alone of the\r\nsailing vessels got into action; and although she was supported by a\r\nnumber of rowing gunboats, whose artillery was heavy, the match was\r\nunequal. According to Arnold's own account, he had disposed his gunboats\r\nand gondolas \"on the west side of Valcour Island, as near together as\r\npossible, and in such a form that few vessels can attack us at the same\r\ntime, and those will be exposed to the fire of the whole fleet.\" To this\r\nCaptain Douglas, in his report of the occurrences, adds the suggestive\r\nparticular that the _Carleton_, by a lucky slant of wind, fetched\r\n\"nearly into the middle of the rebel half-moon, where she anchored with\r\na spring on her cable.\" The position was one of honorable distinction,\r\nbut likewise of great exposure. Her first officer lost an arm; her\r\ncaptain, Lieutenant Dacres, was so severely wounded that he was about\r\nto be thrown overboard as dead; and Pellew, thus left without a\r\nsuperior, fought the vessel through the engagement. When signal was at\r\nlast made to withdraw, the _Carleton_ was able to do so only by help of\r\nthe gunboats, which towed her out of fire. On the other hand, Arnold's\r\nflag-ship, the schooner _Royal Savage_, which had fought in advance of\r\nher consorts and under canvas, fell to leeward, and came there under the\r\ndistant fire of the _Inflexible_, by which she was badly crippled. She\r\nthen was run ashore on the southern point of the island, where she fell\r\nmomentarily into the hands of the British, who turned her guns on her\r\nformer friends. Later in the day, it seeming probable that she might be\r\nretaken, she was set on fire and burned to the water's edge. Thus\r\nabandoned, she sank to the bottom, where her hull rests to this day.\r\nDuring the recent summer of 1901 some gun-carriages have been recovered\r\nfrom her, after lying for a century and a quarter beneath the surface of\r\nthe lake.\r\n\r\nPellew's personal activity and strength enabled his gallantry to show to\r\nparticular advantage in this sanguinary contest. When the _Carleton_, in\r\nher attempt to withdraw, hung in stays under the island, her decks swept\r\nby the bullets of the riflemen on shore, it was he who sprang out on the\r\nbowsprit to bear the jib over to windward. When the tow-rope was cut by\r\na shot, it was Pellew again who exposed his person for the safety of the\r\nvessel. His two seniors being forced by their wounds to leave the\r\nschooner, he succeeded to the command, in which he was afterwards\r\nconfirmed. In this sharp affair the _Carleton_ lost eight killed and six\r\nwounded,--about half her crew,--and had two feet of water in her hold\r\nwhen she anchored out of range.\r\n\r\nTowards evening the _Inflexible_ succeeded in getting within point-blank\r\nrange of the American flotilla, \"when five broadsides,\" wrote Douglas,\r\n\"silenced their whole line;\" a sufficient testimony to the superiority\r\nof her concentrated battery over the dispersed force of all her numerous\r\npetty antagonists. The British then anchored to the southward of\r\nArnold's little force; but that active and enterprising officer\r\nsucceeded in stealing during the night between the enemy and the western\r\nshore, and retired towards Crown Point. The chase to windward continued\r\nduring the next day, but a favorable shift of wind, to the north,\r\nreached the British first, and enabled them to close. Arnold again\r\nbehaved with the extraordinary bravery and admirable conduct which\r\ndistinguished him in battle. Sending on the bulk of the squadron, he\r\ntook the rear with two galleys, covering the retreat. Fighting like a\r\nlion, he opposed the enemy's advance long enough to secure the escape of\r\nsix of his vessels; and then, seeing his one consort forced to strike,\r\nhe ran his own galley ashore and set her on fire. \"Arnold,\" says the\r\nnaval historian Cooper, \"covered himself with glory, and his example\r\nseems to have been nobly followed by most of his officers and men. The\r\nmanner in which the Congress was fought until she had covered the\r\nretreat of the galleys, and the stubborn resolution with which she was\r\ndefended until destroyed, converted the disasters of this part of the\r\nday into a species of triumph.\" \"The Americans,\" says a contemporary\r\nBritish writer, \"chiefly gloried in the dangerous attention paid by\r\nArnold to a nice point of honor, in keeping his flag flying, and not\r\nquitting his galley till she was in flames, lest the enemy should have\r\nboarded and struck it.\"\r\n\r\nPellew received like recognition, not, perhaps, from the popular voice,\r\nbut from his official superiors. Douglas, the senior naval officer at\r\nQuebec, who was made a baronet in reward of these operations, Lord Howe\r\nat New York, and the First Lord of the Admiralty in England, all sent\r\nhim personal letters of commendation; and the two latter promised him\r\npromotion as soon as he came within their respective jurisdictions. His\r\ncontinuance at the front of operations during this and the following\r\nyear therefore postponed his deserved advancement to a lieutenancy, by\r\nretaining him from the \"jurisdiction\" of those able to bestow it.\r\n\r\nThe two gallant enemies were soon again brought together in an incident\r\nwhich came near to change the career of one of them, and, in so doing,\r\nto modify seriously the fortunes of many others. Arnold having one day\r\npulled out on the open lake, in his venturesome manner, Pellew gave\r\nchase in another boat. The Americans being hard pressed and capture\r\nprobable, Arnold unbuckled his stock and himself took an oar. So nearly\r\ncaught was he, that he had to escape into the bushes, leaving behind him\r\nstock and buckle; and these, as late as sixty years after, remained in\r\nthe possession of Pellew's brother. Had he thus been deprived of the\r\nopportunity that Saratoga gave him the next year, Arnold's name might\r\nnow be known to us only as that of the brave officer who kept his\r\ncountry's flag flying till his vessel was in flames.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of October Carleton landed at Crown Point, which the\r\nAmericans had abandoned; but the lateness of the season deterred him\r\nfrom advancing against Ticonderoga, and he soon afterwards returned to\r\nCanada. The full import of this halt is too easily overlooked, with\r\nconsequent failure to appreciate the momentous influence exerted upon\r\nthe course of the Revolutionary War by this naval campaign, in which\r\nPellew bore so conspicuous a part. It has never been understood in\r\nAmerica, where the smallness of the immediate scale has withdrawn\r\nattention from the greatness of the ultimate issue, in gaining time for\r\nthe preparations which resulted in the admittedly decisive victories\r\nabout Saratoga. \"If we could have begun our expedition four weeks\r\nearlier,\" wrote a German general there present, \"I am satisfied\r\neverything would have been ended this year [1776]; were our whole army\r\nhere, it would be an easy matter to drive the enemy from their\r\nentrenchments at Ticonderoga.\" The delay, not of four weeks only, but of\r\nthe whole summer, was obtained by the naval force organized upon\r\nChamplain by Arnold and his superior, General Schuyler. The following\r\nyear the invasion was resumed, under General Burgoyne. Pellew\r\naccompanied him with a body of seamen, taking part in all the operations\r\ndown to the final surrender. Burgoyne, indeed, afterwards chaffed him\r\nwith being the cause of the disaster, by rebuilding the bridge which\r\nenabled the army to cross from the east bank of the Hudson to the west.\r\n\r\nReturning to England in the early part of 1778, Pellew was made\r\nlieutenant, and in 1780 we find him again serving under Captain Pownoll,\r\nas first lieutenant of the _Apollo_ frigate. On the 15th of June, in the\r\nsame year, the _Apollo_ met the French frigate _Stanislas_. A severe\r\naction followed, and at the end of an hour Pownoll was shot through the\r\nbody. As his young friend raised him from the deck, he had barely time\r\nto say, \"Pellew, I know you won't give his Majesty's ship away,\" and\r\nimmediately expired. The engagement lasted an hour longer, when the\r\nenemy, which had all the time been standing in for the Belgian coast,\r\ntook the ground, the most of her spars, already wounded, going overboard\r\nwith the shock. The _Apollo_ had hauled off a few moments before,\r\nfinding that she had less than five feet of water under her keel.\r\n\r\nThough unable again to attack the _Stanislas_, which claimed the\r\nprotection of the neutral flag, the result was substantially a victory;\r\nbut to Pellew's grief for the death of a tried friend was added the\r\nmaterial loss of a powerful patron. Happily, however, his reputation was\r\nknown to the head of the Admiralty, who not only promoted him for this\r\naction, but also gave him a ship, though a poor one. After a succession\r\nof small commands, he was fortunate enough again to distinguish\r\nhimself,--driving ashore and destroying several French privateers, under\r\ncircumstances of such danger and difficulty as to win him his next\r\ngrade, post-captain. This step, which, so far as selection went, fixed\r\nhis position in the navy, he received on the 25th of May, 1782.\r\n\r\nThe ten years of peace that shortly followed were passed by many\r\nofficers in retirement, which we have seen was contentedly accepted by\r\nhis distinguished contemporary, Saumarez; but Pellew was a seaman to the\r\nmarrow, and constantly sought employment afloat. When out of occupation,\r\nhe for a while tried farming, the Utopian employment that most often\r\nbeguiles the imagination of the inbred seaman in occasional weariness of\r\nsalt water; but, as his biographer justly remarks, his mind, which\r\nallowed him to be happy only when active, could ill accommodate itself\r\nto pursuits that almost forbade exertion. \"To have an object in view,\r\nyet to be unable to advance it by any exertions of his own, was to him a\r\nsource of constant irritation. He was wearied with the imperceptible\r\ngrowth of his crops, and complained that he made his eyes ache by\r\nwatching their daily progress.\"\r\n\r\nHis assiduous applications, however, were not wholly unavailing to\r\nobtain him the professional employments usually so hard to get in times\r\nof peace. For five of the ten years, 1783-1793, he commanded frigates,\r\nchiefly on the Newfoundland station; and in them, though now turning\r\nthirty, he displayed the superabundant vitality and restless activity\r\nthat had characterized his early youth. \"Whenever there was exertion\r\nrequired aloft,\" wrote a midshipman who served with him at this period,\r\n\"to preserve a sail or a mast, the captain was foremost in the work,\r\napparently as a mere matter of amusement, and there was not a man in the\r\nship that could equal him in personal activity. He appeared to play\r\namong the elements in the hardest storms. I remember once, in\r\nclose-reefing the main topsail, the captain had given his orders from\r\nthe quarter-deck and sent us aloft. On gaining the topsail yard, the\r\nmost active and daring of our party hesitated to go upon it, as the sail\r\nwas flapping violently, making it a service of great danger; but a voice\r\nwas heard from the extreme end of the yard, calling upon us to exert\r\nourselves to save the sail, which would otherwise beat to pieces. A man\r\nsaid, 'Why, that's the captain! How the ---- did he get there?' He had\r\nfollowed us up, and, clambering over the backs of the sailors, had\r\nreached the topmast head, above the yard, and thence descended by the\r\nlift,\"--a feat unfortunately not easy to be explained to landsmen, but\r\nwhich will be allowed by seamen to demand great hardihood and address.\r\n\r\nAll this was the simple overflow of an animal energy not to be\r\nrepressed, the exulting prowess of a giant delighting to run his course.\r\nIt found expression also in joyous practical jests, like those of a big\r\nboy, which at times had ludicrous consequences. On one occasion of state\r\nceremony, the king's birthday, Pellew had dressed in full uniform to\r\nattend a dinner on shore. The weather was hot, and the crew had been\r\npermitted an hour's swimming around the ship. While his boat was being\r\nmanned, the captain stood by the frigate's rail watching the bathers,\r\nand near by him was one of the ship's boys. \"I too shall have a good\r\nswim soon,\" called the latter to a comrade in the water. \"The sooner,\r\nthe better,\" said Pellew, coming behind him and tipping him overboard.\r\nNo sooner had the lad risen to the surface from his plunge than it was\r\nplain that he could not swim; so in after him went the practical joker,\r\nwith all his toggery. \"If ever the captain was frightened,\" writes the\r\nofficer just quoted, \"it was then.\"\r\n\r\nBut along with all this physical exuberance and needless assumption of\r\nmany of the duties of a foremast hand, Pellew possessed to a very\r\nremarkable extent that delicate art of seamanship which consists in so\r\nhandling a ship as to make her do just what you want, and to put her\r\njust where she should be; making her, to use a common sea expression, do\r\neverything but talk. This is a faculty probably inborn, like most others\r\nthat reach any great degree of perfection, and, while a very desirable\r\ngift, it is by no means indispensable to the highest order of naval\r\nexcellence. Nelson did not at all equal Pellew in this respect, as is\r\nindicated by an amusing story transmitted by a Colonel Stewart, who\r\nserved on board the great admiral's flag-ship during the expedition\r\nagainst Copenhagen: \"His lordship was rather too apt to interfere in the\r\nworking of the ship, and not always with the best judgment or success.\r\nThe wind, when off Dungeness, was scanty, and the ship was to be put\r\nabout. Lord Nelson would give the orders, and caused her to miss stays.\r\nUpon this he said, rather peevishly, to the officer of the watch, 'Well,\r\nnow see what we have done. Well, sir, what mean you to do now?' The\r\nofficer saying, with hesitation, 'I don't exactly know, my lord. I fear\r\nshe won't do,' Lord Nelson turned sharply to the cabin, and replied,\r\n'Well, I am sure if you do not know what to do with her, no more do I,\r\neither.' He went in, leaving the officer to work the ship as he liked.\"\r\nYet Nelson understood perfectly what ships could do, and what they could\r\nnot; no one could better handle or take care of a fleet, or estimate the\r\npossibility of performing a given manoeuvre; and long before he was\r\ncalled to high command he was distinguished for a knowledge of naval\r\ntactics to which few, if any other, of his time attained. He was a great\r\ngeneral officer; and whether he had the knack of himself making a ship\r\ngo through all her paces without a fault mattered as little as whether\r\nhe was a crack shot with a gun.\r\n\r\nA ship is certainly the most beautiful and most graceful of machines; a\r\nmachine, too, so varied in its movements and so instinct with life that\r\nthe seaman affectionately transfers to her credit his own virtues in\r\nhandling her. Pellew's capacity in this part of his profession was so\r\nremarkable that it is somewhat singular to find him, in his first\r\nfrigate action, compelled to discard manoeuvring, and to rely for\r\nvictory upon sheer pluck and luck. When war with the French republic\r\nbegan in 1793, his high reputation immediately insured him command of a\r\nfrigate, the _Nymphe_. The strength of England as a naval power lay\r\nlargely in the great reserve of able seamen manning her merchant ships;\r\nbut as these were scattered in all quarters of the world, great\r\nembarrassment was commonly felt at the outbreak of a war, and especially\r\nwhen it came with the unexpected rapidity of the revolutionary fury. As\r\nthe object of first importance was to get the fleets of\r\nships-of-the-line to sea, Pellew had to depend chiefly upon his own\r\nindefatigable exertions to procure a crew for his vessel. Seamen being\r\nhard to find, he had on board a disproportionate number of landsmen when\r\nthe _Nymphe_, on the 19th of June, 1793, encountered the French vessel\r\n_Cléopâtre_, of force slightly inferior, except in men, but not\r\nsufficiently so to deny the victor the claim of an even fight.\r\n\r\nA peculiar incident preceding the action has interest, as showing the\r\nstrong preoccupation of men's minds at the opening of war, before\r\nmeetings with the enemy have lost novelty. Pellew's younger brother,\r\nIsrael, a commander in the navy, being otherwise unemployed, had come\r\nout with him for the cruise. The _Cléopâtre_ having been first seen in\r\nthe early morning, Edward would not have him called till just as the\r\n_Nymphe_ was closing. As he came on deck, the brother said\r\naffectionately, \"Israel, you have no business here. We are too many eggs\r\nfrom one nest. I am sorry I brought you from your wife.\" But the other\r\nwas unheeding, his eyes fixed upon the stranger. \"That's the very\r\nfrigate,\" he cried, \"that I've been dreaming of all night! I dreamt that\r\nwe shot away her wheel.\" And, hastening to the after-gun, he made the\r\nFrench ship's wheel the object of an unremitting fire.\r\n\r\nBy the way the enemy was handled it was evident that she was well\r\nmanned and ably commanded. She had, in fact, been in commission for over\r\na year. Great as was his own skill, Pellew could not venture upon\r\nmanoeuvres with a green crew, untrained save at the guns, and only\r\nfilled the night before by pressing from a merchant vessel. He therefore\r\ndetermined upon a simple artillery duel. The Frenchman waited under\r\nshort canvas, while the _Nymphe_, with greater way, drew slowly up on\r\nhis starboard, or right-hand side; both ships running nearly before the\r\nwind, but having it a little on the left side. Each captain stood\r\nuncovered, and as the bows of the _Nymphe_ doubled upon the stern of the\r\n_Cléopâtre_, within three hundred feet, a French sailor was seen to run\r\naloft and fasten a red cap of liberty to the mainmast head. The eyes of\r\nthe British seamen were fastened upon their commander, awaiting the\r\ngesture which he had set, instead of word of mouth, for opening fire. At\r\nquarter-past six he gave it, raising his cap to his head. A furious\r\ncannonade at once began, and, the _Nymphe_ shortening sail as soon as\r\nfairly abreast her antagonist, the two frigates continued on parallel\r\nlines, maintaining their relative positions as though at anchor, and\r\nrolling easily in the soft summer sea under the recoil of their guns. So\r\nnearly matched were the gunners that the conflict, unusually deadly\r\nthough it was, might have lasted long, but at a little before seven\r\nIsrael Pellew's dream was fulfilled. The Frenchman's wheel was shot\r\naway, and, the mizzenmast going overboard at the same time, the\r\n_Cléopâtre_ yielded to the impulse of her forward sails, turned sharp\r\nround to the right, and ran perpendicularly into the _Nymphe_. The\r\nBritish boarded her, fixed in this disadvantageous position, fought\r\ntheir way aft, and, although the French crew was numerically superior,\r\nin ten minutes hauled down the colors. In this brief hour they had lost\r\ntwenty-three killed and twenty-seven wounded, the enemy sixty-three\r\nkilled and wounded, out of ships' companies numbering respectively two\r\nhundred and forty and three hundred and twenty.\r\n\r\nThis was the first decisive frigate action of the War of the French\r\nRevolution, and in consequence great was the enthusiasm aroused. Lord\r\nHowe wrote to Pellew, \"The manner in which you have taken the enemy's\r\nship will set an example for the war.\" In truth, however, while\r\nadmitting the soundness of Pellew's judgment in adopting the course he\r\ndid, the actual demand upon his personal skill was less, and in so far\r\nthe credit due therefore less, than in the second successful frigate\r\naction, in the following October, in which Sir James Saumarez commanded.\r\nNot only was the French vessel's superiority in force more marked in the\r\nlatter instance, but Saumarez's ship there met with an accident similar\r\nin character to that which befell the _Cléopâtre_, from the consequences\r\nof which she was extricated by his masterly seamanship. Still, it may\r\nwith fairness be argued that, as the one action from its attendant\r\ncircumstances evidenced the individual skill of the commander, so the\r\nother testified to the antecedent preparation and efficiency of the\r\ncrew, which are always to be attributed to the care of the captain,\r\nespecially under the conditions of Pellew's enlistments. Both captains\r\nfully deserved the reward of knighthood bestowed upon their success.\r\nIsrael Pellew was promoted to post-captain.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three years of this war British commerce in the\r\nneighborhood of the Channel suffered most severely from French cruisers.\r\nThe latter resumed the methods of Jean Bart and other celebrated\r\nprivateers of the days of Louis XIV.; the essence of which was to prey\r\nupon the enemy's commerce, not by single vessels, but by small squadrons\r\nof from five to seven. Cruisers so combined, acting in mutual support,\r\nwere far more efficient than the same number acting separately.\r\nSpreading like a fan, they commanded a wider expanse than a ship alone;\r\nif danger arose, they concentrated for mutual support; did opportunity\r\noffer, the work was cut out and distributed, thus insuring by\r\nco-operation more thorough results. At the suggestion of Sir Edward\r\nPellew, the British Admiralty determined to oppose to these organized\r\ndepredators a similar system. Groups of crack frigates were constituted,\r\nand sent to cruise within the limits of the Channel Fleet, but\r\nindependent of its admiral. In these Pellew served for the next five\r\nyears, much of the time as squadron commander; to him a period of\r\nincessant, untiring activity, and illustrated by many brilliant and\r\nexciting incidents, for which the limits of this sketch afford no space.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two episodes in which he was so distinctly the\r\ncentral figure that they demand at least a brief narration. In January,\r\n1796, while his ship was repairing, a large East Indiaman, the _Dutton_,\r\ncarrying some six hundred troops and passengers, was by a series of\r\nmishaps driven ashore on the beach of Plymouth, then an unprotected\r\nsound. As she struck, all her masts went overboard, and she lay\r\nbroadside to the waves, pounding heavily as they broke over her. Pellew\r\nwas at this moment driving to a dinner with his wife. Seeing crowds\r\nrunning from various directions towards the same quarter, he asked the\r\nreason. Upon learning it, he left his carriage and hurried to the scene.\r\nWhen he arrived, he recognized, by the confusion on board, by the way\r\nthe ship was laboring, by the poverty of the means that had been\r\ncontrived for landing the imperilled souls,--only a single hawser having\r\nbeen run to the shore,--that the loss of nearly all on board was\r\nimminent. Night, too, was falling, as well as the destruction of the\r\nvessel impending. After vainly offering rewards to the hardy boatmen\r\nstanding by, if they would board the wreck with a message from him, he\r\nsaid, \"Then I must go myself.\" Though then close to forty years of age,\r\nhis immense personal strength and activity enabled him, though sorely\r\nbruised thereby, to be hauled on board through the breakers by the\r\nhawser, which alternately slacked and then tightened with a jerk as the\r\ndoomed ship rolled to and fro in the seas. Once on board, he assumed\r\ncommand, the want of which, through the absence of the proper captain,\r\nhad until then hampered and well-nigh paralyzed all effectual effort.\r\nWhen his well-known name was spoken, three hearty cheers arose from the\r\ntroops on board, echoed by the thousands of spectators on shore; and the\r\nhope that revived with the presence of a born leader of men showed\r\nitself at once in the renewed activity and intelligent direction of\r\neffort, on the decks and on the beach. The degree of the danger can be\r\nestimated from the fact that boats from the ships of war in port, his\r\nown included, tried in vain to approach and had to run for safety to the\r\ninner harbor. With sword drawn,--for many of the soldiers were drunk and\r\nriotous,--Pellew maintained order, guided with a seaman's readiness the\r\npreparations for landing, and saw the women, the children,--one child\r\nbut three weeks old,--the sick, landed first, then the soldiers, lastly\r\nthe seamen. When he himself was transferred to the beach by the same\r\nmeans that his skill had contrived for others, but three persons\r\nremained on board, officers of the ship, who eased him on shore. The\r\ninjuries he had received in his perilous passage out, and which confined\r\nhim to his bed for a week, forbade his being last. To the end of his\r\nlife, this saving of the crew of the _Dutton_ was the action in which he\r\ntook most pride.\r\n\r\nThe year that opened with this magnificent act of self-devotion saw\r\nPellew, at its close, bearing a seaman's part in the most serious crisis\r\nthat befell his country during the wars of the French Revolution. The\r\nend of 1796 and the earlier months of 1797 marked the nadir of Great\r\nBritain's military fortunes. The successes of Bonaparte's Italian\r\ncampaign were then culminating; Austria was on the point of making peace\r\nwith France; England was about to find herself alone, and the discontent\r\nof the seamen of the navy, long smouldering, was soon to break out into\r\nthe famous and threatening mutinies of the Channel Fleet and of the\r\nNore. At the same time France, relieved on her eastern frontiers, felt\r\nable to devote seventeen ships-of-the-line and eighteen thousand troops\r\nto the invasion of Ireland.\r\n\r\nPellew, with two frigates besides his own, was stationed off the mouth\r\nof Brest harbor to watch the enemy's movements; the main British fleet\r\nbeing some fifty miles to seaward. To this emergency he brought not only\r\nthe intrepidity of a great seaman and the ardor of an anxious patriot,\r\nbut likewise the intense though narrow Protestant feeling transmitted\r\nfrom a past, then not so remote, when Romanism and enmity to England\r\nwere almost synonymous. \"How would you like,\" said he to an officer who\r\nshared Pitt's liberal tendencies, \"to see Roman Catholic chaplains on\r\nboard our ships?\" and to the end of his life he opposed the political\r\nenfranchisement of persons of that creed.\r\n\r\nThe French expedition against Ireland sailed from Brest on the 16th of\r\nDecember, 1796. Having sent off successively each of his consorts with\r\ninformation for the fleet, Pellew remained with his own ship alone, the\r\n_Indefatigable_, at the moment of the final start. There are two\r\nprincipal channels by which Brest can be left, one leading to the south,\r\nthe other due west. The French admiral had at first intended to use the\r\nformer; but, the wind showing signs of an unfavorable shift, he\r\nendeavored to change the orders just as night was falling. The weather\r\nbeing hazy, his signals were understood by but few of the forty-odd\r\nvessels composing the force. Eight or ten joined him; the remainder\r\nfollowed the original instructions and went out by the south. Pellew\r\nattached himself to the admiral's division, kept along with it just out\r\nof gun-shot, and by making false signals, burning blue lights and\r\nsending up rockets, introduced into the attempts to convey the wishes of\r\nthe commander-in-chief such confusion as rendered them utterly futile.\r\nHaving satisfied himself as to the general direction taken by the\r\nenemy, he left them, and made all sail for Falmouth, where he arrived on\r\nthe 20th.\r\n\r\nThe general fortunes of the expedition do not belong to the present\r\nstory. Suffice it to say that the greater part reached Ireland safely,\r\nbut through stress of weather was unable to land the troops, and went\r\nback to France by detachments, in January, 1797. It is during this\r\nprocess of return that Sir Edward Pellew again appears, in perhaps the\r\nmost dramatic incident of his stirring career.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of January 13th, being then in company with the frigate\r\n_Amazon_, and about one hundred and twenty miles west of Brest, a French\r\nship-of-the-line was discovered. The stranger, named the _Droits de\r\nl'Homme_, was returning from Ireland, and heading east. The frigates\r\nsteered courses converging towards hers, seeking to cut her off from the\r\nland. The weather was thick and gloomy, with a strong west wind fast\r\nrising to a gale. At half-past four, as night was falling, the French\r\nship carried away her fore and main topmasts in a heavy squall; and an\r\nhour later the _Indefatigable_, now under close reefs, passed across her\r\nstern, pouring in a broadside from so near that the French flag floated\r\nacross her poop, where it was seized and torn away by some of the\r\nBritish seamen. The enemy, having on board nearly a thousand soldiers\r\nbesides her crew, replied with rapid volleys of musketry, and, as the\r\nfrigate passed ahead, sheered impetuously towards her, attempting to\r\nboard, and in her turn grazing the stern of the _Indefatigable_. In\r\nanother hour the _Amazon_ drew up, and then the British vessels took\r\ntheir positions, one on either bow of the _Droits de l'Homme_, whence,\r\nby movements of the helm, they alternately raked her. The labor of the\r\ngunners, however, was arduous, due to the deep rolling of the ships, on\r\nboard which, also, the seas poured in volumes through the gun-ports. On\r\nthe main decks the men fought up to their middles in water, the heavy\r\ncannon broke away from the breechings, or ropes used to control them,\r\nand even iron bolts tore out from the ships' sides under the severe\r\nrecoil of the guns. Thus through the long winter night the three ships\r\nrushed headlong before the gale towards the French coast, intent on\r\nmutual destruction; the constant storm of shot, though flying wild under\r\nthe violent motions of the vessels, tearing through spars and rigging,\r\nand crippling them in much that was essential to their safety.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock in the morning of the 14th, long before daybreak, land\r\nwas sighted right ahead. The _Indefatigable_ hauled at once to the\r\nsouthward, the _Amazon_ to the northward; the enemy alone, seemingly\r\nunconscious of the danger, kept on, and as she passed Pellew's ship\r\nfired a broadside which severely wounded all the masts. The situation of\r\nthe combatants was well-nigh desperate. They had reached the coast of\r\nFrance at a point where it forms a deep recess, called Audierne Bay,\r\nfrom either side of which project capes that must be cleared in order to\r\ngain once more the open sea. One only of the three escaped. The _Droits\r\nde l'Homme_, unmanageable for want of sail power, tried to anchor, but\r\ndrove, and struck on a shoal some distance from the beach. Of sixteen\r\nhundred souls on board when the battle began, over one hundred had been\r\nkilled; and of those who survived the fight three hundred perished in\r\nthe wreck. The _Amazon_, likewise crippled, though not so badly, had\r\ngone ashore to the northward only ten minutes after she ceased firing.\r\nOf her people, but six were drowned. The _Indefatigable_, beating back\r\nand forth against the gale before the scene of the French disaster, upon\r\nwhich her crew gazed with the solemn feeling that such might soon be\r\ntheir own fate, succeeded at last in clearing the southern cape. At\r\neleven o'clock, nearly twenty-four hours after first meeting the foe,\r\nand with six feet of water in her hold, she passed only three-quarters\r\nof a mile outside of the Penmarcks, a rocky promontory thirty miles\r\nsouth of Brest.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable encounter is said to have suggested to Marryat the vivid\r\nsea picture with which \"The King's Own\" ends. Pellew's unusual personal\r\nendurance was signally illustrated on the same day, very shortly after\r\nthe safety of the ship from wreck was assured. Her principal sails had\r\nbeen so torn by shot as to require immediate renewing, and this had\r\nscarcely been done when two vessels were sighted, one of which was for\r\nthe moment supposed to be the _Amazon_, whose fate was yet unknown.\r\nPellew gave orders to chase, but his officers represented to him that,\r\nwhatever he himself was capable of, the ship's company was too exhausted\r\nfor present further exertion; and that, besides, the ammunition was very\r\nshort, almost the last filled cartridge having been expended. Under\r\nthese circumstances he was compelled to desist.\r\n\r\nThe interest of Pellew's career centres mainly in his command of\r\nfrigates. This independent but yet restricted sphere afforded the\r\nfullest scope for a conspicuous display of those splendid\r\nqualities--fearlessness, enterprise, sound judgment, instant decision,\r\nand superb seamanship--which he so eminently possessed. He was, above\r\nall, the frigate captain. \"Nothing like hesitation was ever seen in him.\r\nHis first order was always his last; and he often declared of himself\r\nthat he never had a second thought worth sixpence.\" In 1799, by a new\r\nAdmiralty rule, he was transferred to the _Impétueux_, a\r\nship-of-the-line, and thenceforth served in that class of vessel until\r\nhis promotion to admiral.\r\n\r\nAs a general officer, Pellew had no opportunity to show whether he\r\npossessed ability of the highest order. For five years he held the\r\ncommand in India; and soon after Collingwood's death he was, in 1811,\r\nappointed commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean. On both stations he\r\nevinced that faculty for careful organization, systematic preparation,\r\nand sagacious distribution of force which carries success up to the\r\npoint which administrative capacity can reach. His ability in planning,\r\nwhile yet a subordinate in command of squadrons, had been recognized by\r\nSt. Vincent during his management of the Brest blockade. \"The\r\ndisposition made by Sir Edward Pellew for the descent on a certain point\r\nis the most masterly I have ever seen.... Although the naval command in\r\nQuiberon may appear too important for a captain, I shall not divest him\r\nof it, unless I am ordered to do so; feeling a thorough conviction that\r\nno man in His Majesty's Navy, be his rank ever so high, will fill it so\r\nwell.\" At the time this was written, June, 1800, he had seven\r\nships-of-the-line under his orders. After the Peace of Amiens, when war\r\nagain began in 1803, he commanded a similar division watching the\r\nSpanish port of Ferrol, in which, although formally neutral, a French\r\ndivision lay at anchor; and in discharge of this duty, both as a seaman\r\nand an administrator, he again justified the eulogium of the old Earl,\r\nnow at the head of the navy as First Lord.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 he was promoted Rear-Admiral, and soon afterwards assigned to\r\nthe East India Station, which he held from 1805 to 1809. Here no naval\r\nactions on the great scale were to be fought, but under his systematic\r\norganization of convoys and cruisers for the protection of commerce the\r\ninsurance premium--the war risk--on the most exposed routes fell\r\nmarkedly,--for the port of Bombay fifty per cent less than at any former\r\nperiod of hostilities; while the losses by capture, when the merchants\r\nobserved his instructions, amounted to but one per cent on the property\r\ninsured, which was less than those caused by the dangers of the sea, and\r\nconsiderably less, also, than the average war losses in other parts of\r\nthe world. All this shows great ability, carefully utilized in diligent\r\npreparation and efficient precaution; and the same characteristics are\r\nto be observed in his administration of the Mediterranean command, of\r\nwider scope and more purely military importance. Nevertheless, it gives\r\nno sure proof of the particular genius of a great captain. Whether,\r\nhaving forged his weapon, Pellew could also wield it; whether, having\r\ncarefully sowed, he could also reap the harvest by large combinations on\r\nthe battle-field, must remain uncertain, at least until probable\r\ndemonstration of his conceptions is drawn from his papers. Nothing is as\r\nyet adduced to warrant positive inference.\r\n\r\nPellew's Mediterranean command coincided in time with the period of\r\nNapoleon's falling fortunes. After Trafalgar, the Emperor decided to\r\nincrease his navy largely, but to keep it in port instead of at sea,\r\nforcing Great Britain also to maintain huge fleets, the expense of\r\nwhich, concurring with the commercial embarrassments that he sought to\r\nbring upon her, might exhaust her power to continue the war. In\r\nconsequence of this policy, British military achievement on the grand\r\nscale was confined to the army in the Spanish peninsula; and in the\r\nbestowal of rewards, after Napoleon's first abdication, but one peerage\r\nwas given to the navy. The great claims of Sir James Saumarez, who was\r\nthe senior of the two, were disregarded on the ground that his flag was\r\nnot flying at the moment, and Pellew was created Baron Exmouth.\r\n\r\nDuring the process of settlement which succeeded the final fall of\r\nNapoleon at Waterloo, Lord Exmouth remained in the Mediterranean. In the\r\nearly part of 1816 he was ordered to visit with his fleet the Barbary\r\nports, and to compel the unconditional release of all slaves who were\r\nnatives of the Ionian Islands; they having become subjects of Great\r\nBritain by the terms of the peace. For many years, while the powers of\r\nEurope were engrossed in the tremendous strife of the French Revolution,\r\nthese piratical states, under pretence of regular hostilities, had\r\npreyed upon the coasts as well as upon the commerce of the weak\r\nMediterranean countries, and captives taken by them were kept in bitter\r\nslavery. Nelson in his correspondence, in 1796, mentions a curious\r\nincident which sufficiently characterizes the general motives and\r\npolicy of these barbarian Courts. He asked an Algerine official visiting\r\nhis ship, why the Dey would not make peace with Genoa and Naples, for\r\nthey would pay well for immunity, as the United States also at that time\r\ndid. The reply was, \"If we make peace with every one, what is the Dey to\r\ndo with his ships?\" In his later experience with the Mediterranean the\r\ngreat admiral realized yet more forcibly the crying shame of Great\r\nBritain's acquiescence. \"My blood boils that I cannot chastise these\r\npirates. They could not show themselves in this sea did not our country\r\npermit. Never let us talk of the cruelty of the African slave trade,\r\nwhile we permit such a horrid war.\" The United States alone, although\r\nthen among the least of naval powers, had taken arms before 1805 to\r\nrepress outrages that were the common reproach of all civilized\r\nnations,--a measure the success of which went far to establish the\r\ncharacter of her navy and prepare it for 1812. Lord Exmouth was also\r\ndirected to demand peace for Sardinia, as well as for any other state\r\nthat should authorize him to act for it. Only Naples availed itself of\r\nthis opportunity.\r\n\r\nAs far as his instructions went, his mission was successful, and, by a\r\nhappy accident, he was able at Tunis and Tripoli to extort further from\r\nthe rulers a promise that thereafter captives should be treated as in\r\ncivilized countries; in other words, that they should no longer be\r\nreduced to slavery. Algiers refused this concession; and the admiral\r\ncould not take steps to enforce it, because beyond his commission. The\r\nDey, however, undertook to consult the Porte; and the fleet, with a few\r\nexceptions, returned to England, where it arrived towards the end of\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile British public feeling had become aroused; for men were saying\r\nthat the outrages of the past had been rather welcome to the commercial\r\nselfishness of the country. The well-protected traders of Great Britain,\r\nshielded by her omnipotent navy, had profited by crimes which drove\r\ntheir weaker rivals from the sea. Just then news came that at the port\r\nof Bona, on the Algiers coast, where there was under the British flag an\r\nestablishment for carrying on the coral fishery, a large number of the\r\nfishermen, mostly Italians, had been wantonly slaughtered by a band of\r\nTurkish troops. To insist, arms in hand, upon reparation for such an\r\noutrage, and upon guarantees for the future, would doubtless be\r\ncondemned by some of our recent lights; but such was not then the temper\r\nof Great Britain. The government determined at once to send a fleet to\r\nthe spot, and Lord Exmouth was chosen for the command, with such a force\r\nas he himself should designate. The gist of his instructions was to\r\ndemand the release, without ransom, of _all_ Christian slaves, and a\r\nsolemn declaration from the Dey that, in future wars, prisoners should\r\nreceive the usage accorded them by European states. Great Britain thus\r\nmade herself, as befitted the obligation imposed by her supreme maritime\r\npower, the avenger of all those oppressed by these scourges of the sea.\r\nThe times of the barbarians were fulfilled.\r\n\r\nDuring a long career of successful piracy, the port of Algiers had\r\naccumulated an extensive and powerful system of defences. These had\r\ndoubtless suffered in condition from the nonchalant fatalism of Turkish\r\nrule, encouraged by a long period of impunity; but they constituted\r\nstill, and under all the shortcomings of the defenders, a most imposing\r\nmenace to an attacking fleet. To convey a precise impression of them by\r\ndetailed verbal description would be difficult, and the attempt probably\r\nconfusing. It may be said, in brief, that the town faces easterly,\r\nrising abruptly up a steep hill; that from its front there then\r\nprojected a pier, nearly a thousand feet long, at whose end was a\r\ncircular fort, carrying seventy guns in three tiers; from that point a\r\nmole extended at right angles to the southward,--parallel, that is, in a\r\ngeneral sense, to the town front, but curving inward through the\r\nsouthern half of its length, so as better to embrace and shelter the\r\nvessels inside. This mole was somewhat over a thousand feet in length,\r\nand had throughout two tiers of guns, linked at their northern extremity\r\nto the circular fort at the pier end. These principal works were flanked\r\nand covered, at either end and on the hillside, by others which it is\r\nunnecessary to particularize. The total number of guns bearing seaward\r\nnumbered near three hundred, of very respectable size for that day. The\r\nbasin formed by the pier and the mole constituted the port proper, and\r\nin it, at the time of the attack, was collected the entire Algerine\r\nnavy, nine frigates and corvettes and thirty-seven gunboats, the paltry\r\nforce that had so long terrorized the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nIn prevision of his present enterprise, Lord Exmouth before leaving the\r\nMediterranean had despatched a light cruiser to Algiers, on a casual\r\nvisit similar to those continually made by ships of war to foreign\r\nports. Her commander, Captain Charles Warde, received from him very\r\nprecise and most secret instructions to examine closely into the\r\ndefences and soundings; to do which it was necessary not only to observe\r\nevery precaution of seeming indifference,--even to the extent of\r\nappearing engrossed with social duties,--but also to conduct under this\r\ncover measurements and observations of at least approximate correctness.\r\nThis duty was performed with singular diligence and success, with the\r\ndouble result of revealing the hopeless inaccuracy of existing charts\r\nand of placing in Exmouth's hands a working plan of the ground,\r\nperfectly trustworthy for his tactical dispositions.\r\n\r\nAs before remarked, in the sketch of Lord St. Vincent, the defence and\r\nattack of seaports, involving as they do both occupation of permanent\r\npositions and the action of mobile bodies, are tactical questions. They\r\ndiffer much, though not radically, from operations in the open sea, or\r\nin the field, where positions may be taken incidentally, but where the\r\nmovements of mobile bodies are the principal factor. In this way, though\r\nwithout using the word tactical, Exmouth treated the problem before him.\r\nFurnished, thanks to his own foresight and Warde's efficiency, with\r\nreliable information concerning the preparations of the enemy, he\r\ncalculated the dispositions necessary to meet them and to crush their\r\nfire. Having assigned to the hostile works, severally and collectively,\r\nthe force needed to overbear them, and having arranged the anchoring\r\npositions for the vessels of his command with reference to the especial\r\ntask of each, as well as for mutual support, he had substantially his\r\nplan of battle, afterwards communicated to the fleet before going into\r\naction; and the same data afforded the foundation for his statement to\r\nthe Government of the number and character of ships needed for success.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of the Admiralty, Lord Exmouth asked for but five\r\nships-of-the-line, five frigates, and five smaller vessels, to which\r\nwere added four mortar boats to play upon the town and arsenal. When met\r\nwith expressions of doubt, he replied, \"I am satisfied, and take the\r\nresponsibility entirely upon myself.\" To satisfy the hesitancy of the\r\nGovernment, he left with the Secretary to the Admiralty a written\r\nstatement that his every requirement had been fulfilled, and that to him\r\nalone, therefore, would failure from deficient power be attributable. On\r\nthe eve of departure he said to his brother Israel, \"If they open fire\r\nwhen the ships are coming up, and cripple them in their masts, the\r\ndifficulty and loss will be greater; but if they allow us to take our\r\nstations, I am sure of them, for I know that nothing can resist a\r\nline-of-battle ship's fire.\" He trusted to the extreme care of his\r\npreparations, which neglected no particular of equipment or\r\norganization, elaborating every detail of training and discipline, and\r\nproviding, by the most diligent foresight and minute instruction, that\r\neach officer concerned should know exactly what was expected of him. In\r\nshort, it was to perfection of quality, and not to an unwieldy bulk of\r\nsuperfluous quantity, that Exmouth confided his fortunes in this last\r\nhazard.\r\n\r\nThe fleet sailed from England on the 28th of July, 1816, was joined at\r\nGibraltar by a Dutch squadron of five frigates, whose commander asked to\r\nshare the coming contest, and on the 26th of August was off the north\r\npoint of Algiers Bay, some twenty miles from the town. At daybreak the\r\nnext morning, the weather being almost calm, a flag of truce was sent\r\nin, bearing the British demands. During its absence a breeze from the\r\nsea sprang up, and the fleet stood in to a mile from the works, where\r\nit stopped to await the reply. At two P.M. the boat was seen returning,\r\nwith the signal that no answer had been given. The flag-ship queried,\r\n\"Are you ready?\" Each ship at once replied, \"Yes;\" and all filling away\r\ntogether stood down to the attack, the admiral leading.\r\n\r\nThe Algerine batteries were fully manned; the mole, moreover, was\r\ncrowded with troops. With singular temerity, they fired no gun as the\r\nships came on, thus relieving the most anxious of Exmouth's\r\npreoccupations concerning the difficulties before him; fearing,\r\nseemingly, that, if otherwise received, the prey might turn and escape.\r\nThe British, on their side, observed the utmost silence; not a gun, not\r\na cheer, marred the solemn impression of the approach. The flag-ship,\r\n_Queen Charlotte_,[16] piloted by an officer who had served continuously\r\nwith Exmouth since 1793, anchored by the stern across the mole head, at\r\na distance of fifty yards, her starboard batteries pointing to sweep it\r\nfrom end to end. Still no sound of battle, as she proceeded to lash her\r\nbows to those of an Algerine brig lying just within the mole. This done,\r\nher crew gave three cheers, as well they might. Then the stolid,\r\nunaccountable apathy of the barbarians ceased, and three guns in quick\r\nsuccession were fired from the eastern battery. Stirred by a movement\r\nof compassion, Lord Exmouth, from the flag-ship's poop, seeing the\r\nMoorish soldiery clustered thick upon the parapets to watch the ships,\r\nwaved to them with his hand to get down. At the first hostile gun he\r\ngave the order \"Stand by!\" at the second, \"Fire!\" and simultaneously\r\nwith the third the _Queen Charlotte's_ broadside rang out, and the\r\nbattle began.\r\n\r\nThe other vessels of the squadron were not all as successful as the\r\nflag-ship in taking the exact position assigned, and the admiral's plan\r\nthereby suffered some of that derangement to which every undertaking,\r\nespecially military and naval, is liable. This, however, produced no\r\neffect upon the general result, except by increasing somewhat the lists\r\nof killed and wounded, through loss of advantageous offensive position,\r\nwith consequent defect in mutual support. But the first broadside is\r\nproverbially half the battle. It was a saying of Collingwood to his\r\ncrew, in a three-decker like the _Queen Charlotte_, that if they could\r\ndeliver three effective fires in the first five minutes no vessel could\r\nresist them; and this was yet more certain when opposed to the\r\nsemi-discipline of adversaries such as the Algerine pirates. Exmouth's\r\ngeneral design was to concentrate his heavy ships at the southern end of\r\nthe mole, whence the curve in the line of batteries would enable them to\r\nenfilade or take in reverse the works at the northern extremity. Here\r\nwere to be the two three-deckers, with a seventy-four between them, all\r\nthree in close order, stem to stern. The two-decker, however, anchored\r\nsome seven hundred feet astern of the _Queen Charlotte_, the intervening\r\nspace being left empty until filled by a thirty-six-gun frigate, upon\r\nwhose captain St. Vincent passed the eulogium, \"He seems to have felt\r\nLord Nelson's eye upon him.\" The two remaining seventy-fours placed\r\nthemselves successively close astern of the first, which was in accord\r\nwith the original purpose, while the other three-decker took the right\r\nflank of the line, and somewhat too far out; in which exposed and\r\nunintended position, beyond the extreme north point contemplated for the\r\nBritish order, she underwent a very heavy loss.\r\n\r\nIn general summary, therefore, it may be said that the broadsides of the\r\nships-of-the-line were opposed from end to end to the heavy central\r\nbatteries on the mole, while the lighter vessels engaged the flanking\r\nworks on the shore to the southward, thus diverting the fire which would\r\nhave harassed the chief assailants,--a service in which the Dutch\r\nsquadron, composed entirely of frigates, rendered important assistance.\r\nThe bomb vessels from the rear threw their shells over the fighting\r\nships into the town and arsenal, and in the admiral's report are\r\ncredited with firing all the shipping in the harbor, except one frigate,\r\ncreating a conflagration which spread over the arsenal and storehouses.\r\nSoon after the contest opened, the thirty-seven Algerine gunboats,\r\ncrowded with troops, were seen advancing under cover of the smoke to\r\nboard the flag-ship. The attempt, rash to insanity, met the fate it\r\nshould have expected; thirty-three were sent to the bottom by the guns\r\nof the _Leander_, stationed ahead of the _Queen Charlotte_, and\r\ncommanding the entrance to the port. An hour later, Lord Exmouth\r\ndetermined to set fire to the remaining frigate. The service was\r\nperformed by an officer and boat's crew, with a steadiness which\r\nelicited from him such admiration that, on the return of the party, he\r\nstopped the working of the ship's upper battery to give them three\r\ncheers. As the hostile vessel burned, she drifted so near the _Queen\r\nCharlotte_ as nearly to involve her in the same fate.\r\n\r\nFrom three to ten P.M. the battle lasted, steady disciplined valor\r\ncontending with a courage in no way inferior, absolutely insensible to\r\ndanger, but devoid of that coherent, skilful direction which is to\r\ncourage what the brain and eye are to the heart. \"I never,\" wrote\r\nExmouth to his brother, \"saw any set of men more obstinate at their\r\nguns, and it was superior fire only that could keep them back. To be\r\nsure, nothing could stand before the _Queen Charlotte's_ broadside.\r\nEverything fell before it, and the Swedish consul assures me we killed\r\nabove five hundred at the very first fire, from the crowded way in which\r\nthe troops were drawn up, four deep above the gunboats, which were also\r\nfull of men. It was a glorious sight,\" he continues, \"to see the\r\n_Charlotte_ take her anchorage, and to see her flag towering on high,\r\nwhen she appeared to be in the flames of the mole itself; and never was\r\na ship nearer burnt; it almost scorched me off the poop. We were obliged\r\nto haul in the ensign, or it would have caught fire.\" He was himself\r\nstruck thrice, though not seriously injured. A cannon-ball carried away\r\nthe skirts of his coat, and one glass of the spectacles in his pocket\r\nwas broken, and the frame bulged, by a shot.\r\n\r\nAt ten P.M., the ammunition of the fleet running short, and its work\r\nbeing substantially accomplished, the ships began to haul off. The sea\r\ndefences and a great part of the town were in ruins. \"To be again\r\neffective,\" wrote Exmouth, \"the defences must be rebuilt from the\r\nfoundation.\" The flanking batteries and the hill forts continued to\r\nannoy the vessels as they retired, but the spirit of the Dey was broken.\r\nTowards eleven a light air from the land sprang up, which freshened into\r\na violent and prolonged thunderstorm, lasting for three hours; and the\r\nflashes of heaven's artillery combined with the glare of the burning\r\ntown to illuminate the withdrawal of the ships.\r\n\r\nThe following morning the Dey signified his submission, and on the 30th\r\nof August Lord Exmouth made known to the fleet that all the terms of\r\nGreat Britain had been yielded; that Christian slavery was forever\r\nabolished, and that by noon of the following day all slaves then in\r\nAlgiers would be delivered to his flag. This was accordingly done, the\r\nwhole number amounting to 1642; which, with those previously released at\r\nTunis and Tripoli, raised to 3003 the human beings whom Exmouth had been\r\nthe instrument of freeing from a fate worse than death. Of this total,\r\nbut eighteen were English; the remainder were almost wholly from the\r\nMediterranean countries. On the 3d of September, just one week after the\r\nattack, the fleet sailed for England.\r\n\r\nProfuse acknowledgment necessarily awaited the hero of a deed in which\r\nnational exultation so happily blended with the sentiment of pity for\r\nthe oppressed. The admiral was raised to the next rank in the peerage,\r\nand honors poured in upon him from every side,--from abroad as well as\r\nfrom his own countrymen. His personal sense of the privilege permitted\r\nhim, thus to crown a life of strenuous exertion by a martial deed of\r\nfar-reaching beneficence, was a reward passing all others. In the\r\nopening words of his official report he voices his thankfulness: \"In all\r\nthe vicissitudes of a long life of public service, no circumstance has\r\never produced on my mind such impressions of gratitude and joy as the\r\nevent of yesterday. To have been one of the humble instruments in the\r\nhands of Divine Providence for bringing to reason a ferocious\r\nGovernment, and destroying for ever the horrid system of Christian\r\nslavery, can never cease to be a source of delight and heartfelt comfort\r\nto every individual happy enough to be employed in it.\"\r\n\r\nHere Lord Exmouth's career closes. Just forty years had elapsed since as\r\na youth he had fought the _Carleton_ on Lake Champlain, and he was yet\r\nto live sixteen in honored retreat; bearing, however, the burden of\r\nthose whose occupation is withdrawn at an age too advanced to form new\r\ninterests. Though in vigorous health and with ample fortune, \"he would\r\nsometimes confess,\" says his biographer, \"that he was happier amid his\r\nearly difficulties.\" The idea of retirement, indeed, does not readily\r\nassociate itself with the impression of prodigious vitality, which from\r\nfirst to last is produced by the record of his varied activities. In\r\nthis respect, as in others, the contrast is marked between him and\r\nSaumarez, the two who more particularly illustrate the complementary\r\nsides of the brilliant group of naval leaders, in the second rank of\r\ndistinction, which clustered around the great names of Nelson, Howe, and\r\nJervis. In the old age of Saumarez, the even, ordered tenor of his\r\nactive military life is reflected in the peaceful, satisfied enjoyment\r\nof repose and home happiness, of the fruits of labors past, which\r\nCollingwood, probably without good reason, fancied to be characteristic\r\nof his own temperament. Lord Exmouth, compelled to be a passive\r\nspectator, saw with consequent increased apprehension the internal\r\npolitical troubles of Great Britain in his later days. Though not a\r\nparty man, he was strongly conservative, so that the agitations of the\r\nReform era concealed from him the advantages towards which it was\r\ntending, and filled him with forebodings for the future of his country.\r\n\r\nLike his distinguished contemporary, Admiral Saumarez, and like many\r\nothers of those lion-hearted, masculine men who had passed their lives\r\namid the storms of the elements and of battle,--and like our own\r\nFarragut,--Lord Exmouth was a deeply religious man. Strong as was his\r\nself-reliance in war and tempest, he rested upon the Almighty with the\r\ndependence of a child upon its father. His noble brother, Sir Israel\r\nPellew, who had followed Nelson into the fire at Trafalgar, departed\r\nwith the words, \"I know in Whom I have believed;\" and of the admiral\r\nhimself, an officer who was often with him during the closing scene\r\nsaid, \"I have seen him great in battle, but never so great as on his\r\ndeathbed.\"\r\n\r\nLord Exmouth died on January 23, 1833. He was at the time Vice-Admiral\r\nof England, that distinguished honorary rank having been conferred upon\r\nhim but a few months before his death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the last four admirals whose careers have been here sketched, Howe\r\nalone inherited fortune and high social rank; but he also fought his\r\nway far beyond the modest position bequeathed to him by his brother.\r\nEminent all, though in varying manner and degree, each illustrated a\r\ndistinct type in the same noble profession. All were admirable officers,\r\nbut they differed greatly in original endowments and consequent\r\ndevelopment. It was intuitive with St. Vincent to take wide and\r\nfar-sighted views, and to embody them in sustained, relentless action.\r\nEndued by nature with invincible energy and determination, he moved\r\nspontaneously and easily along his difficult path. He approached,\r\nalthough he did not attain genius. In Howe is seen rather the result of\r\nconscientious painstaking acting upon excellent abilities, but\r\nstruggling always against a native heaviness and a temper\r\nconstitutionally both indolent and indulgent; a temper to which indeed\r\nhe does not yield, over which he triumphs, but which nevertheless\r\nimposes itself upon his general course with all the force inseparable\r\nfrom hereditary disposition. A man of talent, he educates himself to\r\nacquirements which in his rival have the character of perception; and\r\nonly under the spur of emergency does he rise to the height of\r\ngreatness. Both were great general officers, a claim which can scarcely\r\nbe advanced for Saumarez and Exmouth, able, brilliant, and devoted as\r\nthey were. Saumarez was the steadfast, skilful, accomplished master of\r\nhis profession, but one whose aptitudes and tastes placed him in the\r\ngreat organization of the fleet, as a principal subordinate rather than\r\nas head. Exmouth was the typical, innate seaman, intensely active, whose\r\ninstincts are those of the partisan warrior, and who shines most in the\r\nfreedom of detached service. All bore a conspicuous part in the greatest\r\nwar of modern times, with honor such that their names will be remembered\r\nas long as naval history endures.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] Fleetwood Hugo Pellew, in \"Our Naval Heroes.\"\r\n\r\n[16] This _Queen Charlotte_ was the successor of the ship which carried\r\nHowe's flag on the First of June, and which had been destroyed by fire\r\noff Leghorn in 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex\r\n\r\n\r\nAboukir Bay, 405.\r\n\r\nAge, standard of, a factor in efficiency, 70.\r\n\r\n_Albany_, sloop, 327, 328.\r\n\r\nAlexandria, 403; 404;\r\n  battle off, 405-408; 410.\r\n\r\nAlgeciras, allied fleet anchored at, 289;\r\n  French ships anchor off, 415;\r\n  Saumarez starts for, 415;\r\n  Saumarez finds French ships moored at, 415;\r\n  _Hannibal_ re-anchors at, 419;\r\n  crowded with eager sight-seers, 419;\r\n  renewed battle off, 420.\r\n\r\nAlgiers, battle of, 428;\r\n  policy of, 462,463;\r\n  Nelson denounces, 463;\r\n  refuses demand of Lord Exmouth in regard to treatment of captives, 464;\r\n  Italian coral fishermen slaughtered on coast of, 464;\r\n  Lord Exmouth demands release of Christian slaves in, 464;\r\n  its system of defences, 465;\r\n  navy of, in port, 466;\r\n  Capt.
