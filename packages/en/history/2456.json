THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED TERPSICHORE\r\n\r\n1. In the meantime those of the Persians who had been left behind in\r\nEurope by Dareios, of whom Megabazos was the commander, had subdued the\r\npeople of Perinthos first of the Hellespontians, since they refused to\r\nbe subject to Dareios. These had in former times also been hardly dealt\r\nwith by the Paionians: for the Paionians from the Strymon had been\r\ncommanded by an oracle of their god to march against the Perinthians;\r\nand if the Perinthians, when encamped opposite to them, should shout\r\naloud and call to them by their name, they were to attack them; but if\r\nthey should not shout to them, they were not to attack them: and thus\r\nthe Paionians proceeded to do. Now when the Perinthians were encamped\r\nopposite to them in the suburb of their city, a challenge was made and\r\na single combat took place in three different forms; for they matched a\r\nman against a man, and a horse against a horse, and a dog against a dog.\r\nThen, as the Perinthians were getting the better in two of the three,\r\nin their exultation they raised a shout of paion, 1 and the Paionians\r\nconjectured that this was the very thing which was spoken of in the\r\noracle, and said doubtless to one another, \"Now surely the oracle\r\nis being accomplished for us, now it is time for us to act.\" So the\r\nPaionians attacked the Perinthians when they had raised the shout of\r\npaion, and they had much the better in the fight, and left but few of\r\nthem alive.\r\n\r\n2. Thus it happened with respect to those things which had been done to\r\nthem in former times by the Paionians; and at this time, although the\r\nPerinthians proved themselves brave men in defence of their freedom,\r\nthe Persians and Megabazos got the better of them by numbers. Then after\r\nPerinthos had been conquered, Megabazos marched his army through the\r\nlength of Thracia, forcing every city and every race of those who\r\ndwell there to submit to the king, for so it had been commanded him by\r\nDareios, to subdue Thracia.\r\n\r\n3. Now the Thracian race is the most numerous, except the Indians, in\r\nall the world: and if it should come to be ruled over by one man, or\r\nto agree together in one, it would be irresistible in fight and the\r\nstrongest by far of all nations, in my opinion. Since however this is\r\nimpossible for them and cannot ever come to pass among them, 2 they are\r\nin fact weak for that reason. They have many names, belonging to their\r\nvarious tribes in different places; but they all follow customs which\r\nare nearly the same in all respects, except the Getai and Trausians and\r\nthose who dwell above the Crestonians.\r\n\r\n4. Of these the practices of the Getai, who believe themselves to be\r\nimmortal, have been spoken of by me already: 3 and the Trausians perform\r\neverything else in the same manner as the other Thracians, but in regard\r\nto those who are born and die among them they do as follows:--when\r\na child has been born, the nearest of kin sit round it and make\r\nlamentation for all the evils of which he must fulfil the measure, now\r\nthat he is born, 301 enumerating the whole number of human ills; but\r\nwhen a man is dead, they cover him up in the earth with sport and\r\nrejoicing, saying at the same time from what great evils he has escaped\r\nand is now in perfect bliss.\r\n\r\n5. Those who dwell above the Crestonians do as follows:--each man has\r\nmany wives, and when any man of them is dead, a great competition takes\r\nplace among his wives, with much exertion on the part of their friends,\r\nabout the question of which of them was most loved by their husband; and\r\nshe who is preferred by the decision and so honoured, is first praised\r\nby both men and women, then her throat is cut over the tomb by her\r\nnearest of kin, and afterwards she is buried together with her husband;\r\nand the others are exceedingly grieved at it, for this is counted as the\r\ngreatest reproach to them.\r\n\r\n6. Of the other Thracians the custom is to sell their children to be\r\ncarried away out of the country; and over their maidens they do not keep\r\nwatch, but allow them to have commerce with whatever men they please,\r\nbut over their wives they keep very great watch; and they buy their\r\nwives for great sums of money from their parents. To be pricked with\r\nfigures is accounted a mark of noble rank, and not to be so marked is a\r\nsign of low birth. 4 Not to work is counted most honourable, and to be a\r\nworker of the soil is above all things dishonourable: to live on war and\r\nplunder is the most honourable thing.\r\n\r\n7. These are their most remarkable customs; and of the gods they worship\r\nonly Ares and Dionysos and Artemis. Their kings, however, apart from the\r\nrest of the people, worship Hermes more than all gods, and swear by him\r\nalone; and they say that they are descended from Hermes.\r\n\r\n8. The manner of burial for the rich among them is this:--for three days\r\nthey expose the corpse to view, and they slay all kinds of victims\r\nand feast, having first made lamentation. Then they perform the burial\r\nrites, either consuming the body with fire or covering it up in the\r\nearth without burning; and afterwards when they have heaped up a mound\r\nthey celebrate games with every kind of contest, in which reasonably the\r\ngreatest prizes are assigned for single combat. 5 This is the manner of\r\nburial among the Thracians.\r\n\r\n9. Of the region lying further on towards the North of this country\r\nno one can declare accurately who the men are who dwell in it; but the\r\nparts which lie immediately beyond the Ister are known to be uninhabited\r\nand vast in extent. The only men of whom I can hear who dwell beyond\r\nthe Ister are those who are said to be called Sigynnai, and who use the\r\nMedian fashion of dress. Their horses, it is said, have shaggy hair all\r\nover their bodies, as much as five fingers long; and these are small and\r\nflat-nosed and too weak to carry men, but when yoked in chariots they\r\nare very high-spirited; therefore the natives of the country drive\r\nchariots. The boundaries of this people extend, it is said, to the parts\r\nnear the Enetoi, who live on the Adriatic; and people say that they\r\nare colonists from the Medes. In what way however these have come to\r\nbe colonists from the Medes I am not able for my part to conceive, but\r\neverything is possible in the long course of ages. However that may be,\r\nthe Ligurians who dwell in the region inland above Massalia call traders\r\nsigynnai, and the men of Cyprus give the same name to spears.\r\n\r\n10. Now the Thracians say that the other side of the Ister is occupied\r\nby bees, and that by reason of them it is not possible to pass through\r\nand proceed further: but to me it seems that when they so speak, they\r\nsay that which is not probable; for these creatures are known to be\r\nintolerant of cold, and to me it seems that the regions which go up\r\ntowards the pole are uninhabitable by reason of the cold climate. These\r\nthen are the tales reported about this country; and however that may\r\nbe, Megabazos was then making the coast-regions of it subject to the\r\nPersians.\r\n\r\n11. Meanwhile Dareios, so soon as he had crossed over the Hellespont and\r\ncome to Sardis, called to mind the service rendered to him by Histiaios\r\nthe Milesian and also the advice of the Mytilenian Coës, and having\r\nsent for them to come to Sardis he offered them a choice of rewards.\r\nHistiaios then, being despot of Miletos, did not make request for\r\nany government in addition to that, but he asked for the district of\r\nMyrkinos which belonged to the Edonians, desiring there to found a city.\r\nHistiaios chose this for himself; but Coës, not being a despot but a man\r\nof the people, asked to be made despot of Mitylene.\r\n\r\n12. After the desires of both had been fulfilled, they betook themselves\r\nto that which they had chosen: and at this same time it chanced that\r\nDareios saw a certain thing which made him desire to command Megabazos\r\nto conquer the Paionians and remove them forcibly from Europe into Asia:\r\nand the thing was this:--There were certain Paionians named Pigres and\r\nMantyas, who when Dareios had crossed over into Asia, came to Sardis,\r\nbecause they desired themselves to have rule over the Paionians, and\r\nwith them they brought their sister, who was tall and comely. Then\r\nhaving watched for a time when Dareios took his seat publicly in the\r\nsuburb of the Lydian city, they dressed up their sister in the best way\r\nthey could, and sent her to fetch water, having a water-jar upon her\r\nhead and leading a horse after her by a bridle round her arm, and at the\r\nsame time spinning flax. Now when the woman passed out of the city by\r\nhim, Dareios paid attention to the matter, for that which was done by\r\nthe woman was not of Persian nor yet of Lydian fashion, nor indeed\r\nafter the manner of any people of Asia. He sent therefore some of his\r\nspearmen, bidding them watch what the woman would do with the horse.\r\nThey accordingly followed after her; and she having arrived at the river\r\nwatered the horse, and having watered him and filled her jar with the\r\nwater, she passed along by the same way, bearing the water upon her\r\nhead, leading the horse after her by a bridle round her arm, and at the\r\nsame time turning the spindle.\r\n\r\n13. Then Dareios, marvelling both at that which he heard from those who\r\nwent to observe and also at that which he saw himself, bade them bring\r\nher into his presence: and when she was brought, her brothers also came,\r\nwho had been watching these things at no great distance off. So then\r\nwhen Dareios asked of what country she was, the young men said that they\r\nwere Paionians and that she was their sister; and he replied: \"Who then\r\nare these Paionians, and where upon the earth do they dwell?\" and he\r\nasked them also what they desired, that they had come to Sardis. They\r\ndeclared to him that they had come to give themselves up to him, and\r\nthat Paionia was a country situated upon the river Strymon, and that\r\nthe Strymon was not far from the Hellespont, and finally that they were\r\ncolonists from the Teucrians of Troy. All these things severally they\r\ntold him; and he asked whether all the women of that land were as\r\nindustrious as their sister; and they very readily replied to this also,\r\nsaying that it was so, for it was with a view to that very thing that\r\nthey had been doing this.\r\n\r\n14. Then Dareios wrote a letter to Megabazos, whom he had left to\r\ncommand his army in Thrace, bidding him remove the Paionians from their\r\nplace of habitation and bring them to the king, both themselves and\r\ntheir children and their wives. Then forthwith a horseman set forth to\r\nride in haste bearing the message to the Hellespont, and having passed\r\nover to the other side he gave the paper to Megabazos. So he having\r\nread it and having obtained guides from Thrace, set forth to march upon\r\nPaionia:\r\n\r\n15. and the Paionians, being informed that the Persians were coming\r\nagainst them, gathered all their powers together and marched out in the\r\ndirection of the sea, supposing that the Persians when they invaded them\r\nwould make their attack on that side. The Paionians then were prepared,\r\nas I say, to drive off the army of Megabazos when it came against them;\r\nbut the Persians hearing that the Paionians had gathered their powers\r\nand were guarding the entrance which lay towards the sea, directed their\r\ncourse with guides along the upper road; and passing unperceived by the\r\nPaionians they fell upon their cities, which were left without men, and\r\nfinding them without defenders they easily took possession of them. The\r\nPaionians when they heard that their cities were in the hands of the\r\nenemy, at once dispersed, each tribe to its own place of abode, and\r\nproceeded to deliver themselves up to the Persians. Thus then it\r\nhappened that these tribes of the Paionians, namely the Siropaionians,\r\n6 the Paioplians and all up to the lake Prasias, were removed from their\r\nplace of habitation and brought to Asia;\r\n\r\n16. but those who dwell about mount Pangaion, and about the Doberians\r\nand Agrianians and Odomantians, 7 and about the lake Prasias itself,\r\nwere not conquered at all by Megabazos. He tried however to remove even\r\nthose who lived in the lake and who had their dwellings in the following\r\nmanner:--a platform fastened together and resting upon lofty piles stood\r\nin the middle of the water of the lake, with a narrow approach to it\r\nfrom the mainland by a single bridge. The piles which supported the\r\nplatform were no doubt originally set there by all the members of the\r\ncommunity working together, but since that time they continue to set\r\nthem by observance of this rule, that is to say, every man who marries\r\nbrings from the mountain called Orbelos three piles for each wife and\r\nsets them as supports; and each man takes to himself many wives. And\r\nthey have their dwelling thus, that is each man has possession of a hut\r\nupon the platform in which he lives and of a trap-door 8 leading through\r\nthe platform down to the lake: and their infant children they tie with\r\na rope by the foot, for fear that they should roll into the water. To\r\ntheir horses and beasts of burden they give fish for fodder; and of fish\r\nthere is so great quantity that if a man open the trap-door and let down\r\nan empty basket by a cord into the lake, after waiting quite a short\r\ntime he draws it up again full of fish. Of the fish there are two kinds,\r\nand they call them paprax and tilon.\r\n\r\n17. So then those of the Paionians who had been conquered were being\r\nbrought to Asia: and Megabazos meanwhile, after he had conquered the\r\nPaionians, sent as envoys to Macedonia seven Persians, who after himself\r\nwere the men of most repute in the army. These were being sent to\r\nAmyntas to demand of him earth and water for Dareios the king. Now from\r\nlake Prasias there is a very short way into Macedonia; for first, quite\r\nclose to the lake, there is the mine from which after this time there\r\ncame in regularly a talent of silver every day to Alexander; and after\r\nthe mine, when you have passed over the mountain called Dysoron, you are\r\nin Macedonia.\r\n\r\n18. These Persians then, who had been sent to Amyntas, having arrived\r\ncame into the presence of Amyntas and proceeded to demand earth and\r\nwater for king Dareios. This he was willing to give, and also he invited\r\nthem to be his guests; and he prepared a magnificent dinner and received\r\nthe Persians with friendly hospitality. Then when dinner was over, the\r\nPersians while drinking pledges to one another 9 said thus: \"Macedonian\r\nguest-friend, it is the custom among us Persians, when we set forth a\r\ngreat dinner, then to bring in also our concubines and lawful wives to\r\nsit beside us. Do thou then, since thou didst readily receive us and\r\ndost now entertain us magnificently as thy guests, and since thou art\r\nwilling to give to king Dareios earth and water, consent to follow our\r\ncustom.\" To this Amyntas replied: \"Persians, among us the custom is not\r\nso, but that men should be separate from women. Since however ye being\r\nour masters make this request in addition, this also shall be given\r\nyou.\" Having so said Amyntas proceeded to send for the women; and\r\nwhen they came being summoned, they sat down in order opposite to the\r\nPersians. Then the Persians, seeing women of comely form, spoke to\r\nAmyntas and said that this which had been done was by no means well\r\ndevised; for it was better that the women should not come at all, than\r\nthat they should come and should not seat themselves by their side, but\r\nsit opposite and be a pain to their eyes. So Amyntas being compelled\r\nbade them sit by the side of the Persians; and when the women obeyed,\r\nforthwith the Persians, being much intoxicated, began to touch their\r\nbreasts, and some no doubt also tried to kiss them.\r\n\r\n19. Amyntas seeing this kept quiet, notwithstanding that he felt anger,\r\nbecause he excessively feared the Persians; but Alexander the son\r\nof Amyntas, who was present and saw this, being young and without\r\nexperience of calamity was not able to endure any longer; but being\r\nimpatient of it he said to Amyntas: \"My father, do thou grant that\r\nwhich thy age demands, and go away to rest, nor persevere longer in\r\nthe drinking; but I will remain here and give to our guests all that is\r\nconvenient.\" On this Amyntas, understanding that Alexander was intending\r\nto do some violence, said: \"My son, I think that I understand thy words,\r\nas the heat of anger moves thee, namely that thou desirest to send me\r\naway and then do some deed of violence: therefore I ask of thee not to\r\ndo violence to these men, that it may not be our ruin, but endure to see\r\nthat which is being done: as to my departure, however, in that I will do\r\nas thou sayest.\"\r\n\r\n20. When Amyntas after having made of him this request had departed,\r\nAlexander said to the Persians: \"With these women ye have perfect\r\nfreedom, guests, to have commerce with all, if ye so desire, or with as\r\nmany of them as ye will. About this matter ye shall be they who give the\r\nword; but now, since already the hour is approaching for you to go to\r\nbed and I see that ye have well drunk, let these women go away, if so it\r\nis pleasing to you, to bathe themselves; and when they have bathed, then\r\nreceive them back into your company.\" Having so said, since the Persians\r\nreadily agreed, he dismissed the women, when they had gone out, to the\r\nwomen's chambers; and Alexander himself equipped men equal in number to\r\nthe women and smooth-faced, in the dress of the women, and giving them\r\ndaggers he led them into the banqueting-room; and as he led them in, he\r\nsaid thus to the Persians: \"Persians, it seems to me that ye have been\r\nentertained with a feast to which nothing was wanting; for other things,\r\nas many as we had, and moreover such as we were able to find out and\r\nfurnish, are all supplied to you, and there is this especially besides,\r\nwhich is the chief thing of all, that is, we give you freely in addition\r\nour mothers and our sisters, in order that ye may perceive fully that\r\nye are honoured by us with that treatment which ye deserve, and also in\r\norder that ye may report to the king who sent you that a man of Hellas,\r\nruler under him of the Macedonians, entertained you well at board and\r\nbed.\" Having thus said Alexander caused a Macedonian man in the guise of\r\na woman to sit by each Persian, and they, when the Persians attempted to\r\nlay hands on them, slew them.\r\n\r\n21. So these perished by this fate, both they themselves and their\r\ncompany of servants; for there came with them carriages and servants and\r\nall the usual pomp of equipage, and this was all made away with at the\r\nsame time as they. Afterwards in no long time a great search was made by\r\nthe Persians for these men, and Alexander stopped them with cunning\r\nby giving large sums of money and his own sister, whose name was\r\nGygaia;--by giving, I say, these things to Bubares a Persian, commander\r\nof those who were searching for the men who had been killed, Alexander\r\nstopped their search.\r\n\r\n22. Thus the death of these Persians was kept concealed. And that these\r\ndescendants of Perdiccas are Hellenes, as they themselves say, I happen\r\nto know myself, and not only so, but I will prove in the succeeding\r\nhistory that they are Hellenes. 10 Moreover the Hellanodicai, who manage\r\nthe games at Olympia, decided that they were so: for when Alexander\r\nwished to contend in the games and had descended for this purpose into\r\nthe arena, the Hellenes who were to run against him tried to exclude\r\nhim, saying that the contest was not for Barbarians to contend in but\r\nfor Hellenes: since however Alexander proved that he was of Argos,\r\nhe was judged to be a Hellene, and when he entered the contest of the\r\nfoot-race his lot came out with that of the first. 11\r\n\r\n23. Thus then it happened with regard to these things: and at the same\r\ntime Megabazos had arrived at the Hellespont bringing with him the\r\nPaionians; and thence after passing over the straits he came to Sardis.\r\nThen, since Histiaios the Milesian was already engaged in fortifying\r\nwith a wall the place which he had asked and obtained from Dareios as a\r\nreward for keeping safe the bridge of boats (this place being that\r\nwhich is called Myrkinos, lying along the bank of the river Strymon),\r\nMegabazos, having perceived that which was being done by Histiaios, as\r\nsoon as he came to Sardis bringing the Paionians, said thus to Dareios:\r\n\"O king, what a thing is this that thou hast done, granting permission\r\nto a Hellene who is skilful and cunning to found a city in Thracia in\r\na place where there is forest for shipbuilding in abundance and great\r\nquantity of wood for oars and mines of silver and great numbers both\r\nof Hellenes and Barbarians living round, who when they have obtained\r\na leader will do that which he shall command them both by day and by\r\nnight. Therefore stop this man from doing so, that thou be not involved\r\nin a domestic war: and stop him by sending for him in a courteous\r\nmanner; but when thou hast got him in thy hands, then cause that he\r\nshall never again return to the land of the Hellenes.\"\r\n\r\n24. Thus saying Megabazos easily persuaded Dareios, who thought that he\r\nwas a true prophet of that which was likely to come to pass: and\r\nupon that Dareios sent a messenger to Myrkinos and said as follows:\r\n\"Histiaios, king Dareios saith these things:--By taking thought I find\r\nthat there is no one more sincerely well disposed than thou art to me\r\nand to my power; and this I know having learnt by deeds not words. Now\r\ntherefore, since I have it in my mind to accomplish great matters,\r\ncome hither to me by all means, that I may communicate them to thee.\"\r\nHistiaios therefore, trusting to these sayings and at the same time\r\naccounting it a great thing to become a counsellor of the king, came\r\nto Sardis; and when he had come Dareios spoke to him as follows:\r\n\"Histiaios, I sent for thee for this reason, namely because when I had\r\nreturned from the Scythians and thou wert gone away out of the sight of\r\nmy eyes, never did I desire to see anything again within so short a time\r\nas I desired then both to see thee and that thou shouldst come to speech\r\nwith me; since I perceived that the most valuable of all possessions is\r\na friend who is a man of understanding and also sincerely well-disposed,\r\nboth which qualities I know exist in thee, and I am able to bear witness\r\nof them in regard to my affairs. Now therefore (for thou didst well in\r\nthat thou camest hither) this is that which I propose to thee:--leave\r\nMiletos alone and also thy newly-founded city in Thracia, and coming\r\nwith me to Susa, have whatsoever things I have, eating at my table and\r\nbeing my counseller.\"\r\n\r\n25. Thus said Dareios, and having appointed Artaphrenes 12 his own\r\nbrother and the son of his father to be governor of Sardis, he marched\r\naway to Susa taking with him Histiaios, after he had first named Otanes\r\nto be commander of those who dwelt along the sea coasts. This man's\r\nfather Sisamnes, who had been made one of the Royal Judges, king\r\nCambyses slew, because he had judged a cause unjustly for money, and\r\nflayed off all his skin: then after he had torn away the skin he cut\r\nleathern thongs out of it and stretched them across the seat where\r\nSisamnes had been wont to sit to give judgment; and having stretched\r\nthem in the seat, Cambyses appointed the son of that Sisamnes whom he\r\nhad slain and flayed, to be judge instead of his father, enjoining him\r\nto remember in what seat he was sitting to give judgment.\r\n\r\n26. This Otanes then, who was made to sit in that seat, had now\r\nbecome the successor of Megabazos in the command: and he conquered the\r\nByzantians and Calchedonians, and he conquered Antandros in the land\r\nof Troas, and Lamponion; and having received ships from the Lesbians\r\nhe conquered Lemnos and Imbros, which were both at that time still\r\ninhabited by Pelasgians.\r\n\r\n27. Of these the Lemnians fought well, and defending themselves for a\r\nlong time were at length brought to ruin; 13 and over those of them\r\nwho survived the Persians set as governor Lycaretos the brother of that\r\nMaiandrios who had been king of Samos. This Lycaretos ruled in Lemnos\r\ntill his death. And the cause of it 14 was this:--he continued to\r\nreduce all to slavery and subdue them, accusing some of desertion to the\r\nScythians and others of doing damage to the army of Dareios as it was\r\ncoming back from Scythia.\r\n\r\n28. Otanes then effected so much when he was made commander: and after\r\nthis for a short time there was an abatement 15 of evils; and then again\r\nevils began a second time to fall upon the Ionians, arising from Naxos\r\nand Miletos. For Naxos was superior to all the other islands in wealth,\r\nand Miletos at the same time had just then come to the very height of\r\nits prosperity and was the ornament 16 of Ionia; but before these events\r\nfor two generations of men it had been afflicted most violently by\r\nfaction until the Parians reformed it; for these the Milesians chose of\r\nall the Hellenes to be reformers of their State.\r\n\r\n29. Now the Parians thus reconciled their factions:--the best men of\r\nthem came to Miletos, and seeing that the Milesians were in a grievously\r\nruined state, they said that they desired to go over their land: and\r\nwhile doing this and passing through the whole territory of Miletos,\r\nwhenever they saw in the desolation of the land any field that was well\r\ncultivated, they wrote down the name of the owner of that field. Then\r\nwhen they had passed through the whole land and had found but few of\r\nsuch men, as soon as they returned to the city they called a general\r\ngathering and appointed these men to manage the State, whose fields they\r\nhad found well cultivated; for they said that they thought these men\r\nwould take care of the public affairs as they had taken care of their\r\nown: and the rest of the Milesians, who before had been divided by\r\nfactions, they commanded to be obedient to these men.\r\n\r\n30. The Parians then had thus reformed the Milesians; but at the time of\r\nwhich I speak evils began to come to Ionia from these States 17 in the\r\nfollowing manner:--From Naxos certain men of the wealthier class 18 were\r\ndriven into exile by the people, and having gone into exile they\r\narrived at Miletos. Now of Miletos it happened that Aristagoras son\r\nof Molpagoras was ruler in charge, being both a son-in-law and also a\r\ncousin of Histiaios the son of Lysagoras, whom Dareios was keeping at\r\nSusa: for Histiaios was despot of Miletos, and it happened that he was\r\nat Susa at this time when the Naxians came, who had been in former\r\ntimes guest-friends of Histiaios. So when the Naxians arrived, they made\r\nrequest of Aristagoras, to see if perchance he would supply them with\r\na force, and so they might return from exile to their own land: and he,\r\nthinking that if by his means they should return to their own State, he\r\nwould be ruler of Naxos, but at the same time making a pretext of the\r\nguest-friendship of Histiaios, made proposal to them thus: \"I am not\r\nable to engage that I can supply you with sufficient force to bring you\r\nback from exile against the will of those Naxians who have control\r\nof the State; for I hear that the Naxians have an army which is eight\r\nthousand shields strong and many ships of war: but I will use every\r\nendeavour to devise a means; and my plan is this:--it chances that\r\nArtaphrenes is my friend: now Artaphrenes, ye must know, 1801 is a son\r\nof Hystaspes and brother of Dareios the king; and he is ruler of all the\r\npeople of the sea-coasts in Asia, with a great army and many ships. This\r\nman then I think will do whatsoever we shall request of him.\" Hearing\r\nthis the Naxians gave over the matter to Aristagoras to manage as\r\nbest he could, and they bade him promise gifts and the expenses of\r\nthe expedition, saying that they would pay them; for they had full\r\nexpectation that when they should appear at Naxos, the Naxians would do\r\nall their bidding, and likewise also the other islanders. For of these\r\nislands, that is the Cyclades, not one was as yet subject to Dareios.\r\n\r\n31. Aristagoras accordingly having arrived at Sardis, said to\r\nArtaphrenes that Naxos was an island not indeed large in size, but fair\r\nnevertheless and of fertile soil, as well as near to Ionia, and that\r\nthere was in it much wealth and many slaves: \"Do thou therefore send an\r\nexpedition against this land, and restore it to those who are now exiles\r\nfrom it: and if thou shalt do this, first I have ready for thee large\r\nsums of money apart from the expenses incurred for the expedition (which\r\nit is fair that we who conduct it should supply), and next thou wilt\r\ngain for the king not only Naxos itself but also the islands which are\r\ndependent upon it, Paros and Andros and the others which are called\r\nCyclades; and setting out from these thou wilt easily attack Euboea, an\r\nisland which is large and wealthy, as large indeed as Cyprus, and very\r\neasy to conquer. To subdue all these a hundred ships are sufficient.\"\r\nHe made answer in these words: \"Thou makest thyself a reporter of good\r\nthings to the house of the king; and in all these things thou advisest\r\nwell, except as to the number of the ships: for instead of one hundred\r\nthere shall be prepared for thee two hundred by the beginning of the\r\nspring. And it is right that the king himself also should join in\r\napproving this matter.\"\r\n\r\n32. So Aristagoras hearing this went back to Miletos greatly rejoiced;\r\nand Artaphrenes meanwhile, when he had sent to Susa and communicated\r\nthat which was said by Aristagoras, and Dareios himself also had joined\r\nin approving it, made ready two hundred triremes and a very great\r\nmultitude both of Persians and their allies, and appointed to be\r\ncommander of these Megabates a Persian, one of the Achaimenidai and a\r\ncousin to himself and to Dareios, to whose daughter afterwards Pausanias\r\nthe son of Cleombrotus the Lacedaemonian (at least if the story be true)\r\nbetrothed himself, having formed a desire to become a despot of Hellas.\r\nHaving appointed Megabates, I say, to be commander, Artaphrenes sent\r\naway the armament to Aristagoras.\r\n\r\n33. So when Megabates had taken force together with the Naxians, he\r\nsailed with the pretence of going to the Hellespont; but when he came\r\nto Chios, he directed his ships to Caucasa, in order that he might from\r\nthence pass them over to Naxos with a North Wind. Then, since it was\r\nnot fated that the Naxians should be destroyed by this expedition, there\r\nhappened an event which I shall narrate. As Megabates was going round to\r\nvisit the guards set in the several ships, it chanced that in a ship\r\nof Myndos there was no one on guard; and he being very angry bade his\r\nspearmen find out the commander of the ship, whose name was Skylax, and\r\nbind him in an oar-hole of his ship in such a manner 19 that his head\r\nshould be outside and his body within. When Skylax was thus bound, some\r\none reported to Aristagoras that Megabates had bound his guest-friend\r\nof Myndos and was doing to him shameful outrage. He accordingly came and\r\nasked the Persian for his release, and as he did not obtain anything\r\nof that which he requested, he went himself and let him loose. Being\r\ninformed of this Megabates was exceedingly angry and broke out in rage\r\nagainst Aristagoras; and he replied: \"What hast thou to do with\r\nthese matters? Did not Artaphrenes send thee to obey me, and to sail\r\nwhithersoever I should order? Why dost thou meddle with things which\r\nconcern thee not?\" Thus said Aristagoras; and the other being enraged at\r\nthis, when night came on sent men in a ship to Naxos to declare to the\r\nNaxians all the danger that threatened them.\r\n\r\n34. For the Naxians were not at all expecting that this expedition\r\nwould be against them: but when they were informed of it, forthwith\r\nthey brought within the wall the property which was in the fields, and\r\nprovided for themselves food and drink as for a siege, and strengthened\r\ntheir wall. 20 These then were making preparations as for war to come\r\nupon them; and the others meanwhile having passed their ships over from\r\nChios to Naxos, found them well defended when they made their attack,\r\nand besieged them for four months. Then when the money which the\r\nPersians had brought with them had all been consumed by them, and not\r\nonly that, but Aristagoras himself had spent much in addition, and\r\nthe siege demanded ever more and more, they built walls for the Naxian\r\nexiles and departed to the mainland again with ill success.\r\n\r\n35. And so Aristagoras was not able to fulfil his promise to\r\nArtaphrenes; and at the same time he was hard pressed by the demand made\r\nto him for the expenses of the expedition, and had fears because of\r\nthe ill success of the armament and because he had become an enemy of\r\nMegabates; and he supposed that he would be deprived of his rule over\r\nMiletos. Having all these various fears he began to make plans of\r\nrevolt: for it happened also that just at this time the man who had been\r\nmarked upon the head had come from Histiaios who was at Susa, signifying\r\nthat Aristagoras should revolt from the king. For Histiaios, desiring\r\nto signify to Aristagoras that he should revolt, was not able to do it\r\nsafely in any other way, because the roads were guarded, but shaved off\r\nthe hair of the most faithful of his slaves, and having marked his head\r\nby pricking it, waited till the hair had grown again; and as soon as it\r\nwas grown, he sent him away to Miletos, giving him no other charge but\r\nthis, namely that when he should have arrived at Miletos he should bid\r\nAristagoras shave his hair and look at his head: and the marks, as I\r\nhave said before, signified revolt. This thing Histiaios was doing,\r\nbecause he was greatly vexed by being detained at Susa. He had\r\ngreat hopes then that if a revolt occurred he would be let go to\r\nthe sea-coast; but if no change was made at Miletos 2001 he had no\r\nexpectation of ever returning thither again.\r\n\r\n36. Accordingly Histiaios with this intention was sending the messenger;\r\nand it chanced that all these things happened to Aristagoras together at\r\nthe same time. He took counsel therefore with his partisans, declaring\r\nto them both his own opinion and the message from Histiaios; and while\r\nall the rest expressed an opinion to the same effect, urging him namely\r\nto make revolt, Hecataios the historian urged first that they should not\r\nundertake war with the king of the Persians, enumerating all the nations\r\nover whom Dareios was ruler, and his power: and when he did not succeed\r\nin persuading him, he counselled next that they should manage to make\r\nthemselves masters of the sea. Now this, he continued, could not come\r\nto pass in any other way, so far as he could see, for he knew that the\r\nforce of the Milesians was weak, but if the treasures should be taken\r\n21 which were in the temple at Branchidai, which Croesus the Lydian\r\ndedicated as offerings, he had great hopes that they might become\r\nmasters of the sea; and by this means they would not only themselves\r\nhave wealth at their disposal, but the enemy would not be able to carry\r\nthe things off as plunder. Now these treasures were of great value, as\r\nI have shown in the first part of the history. 22 This opinion did not\r\nprevail; but nevertheless it was resolved to make revolt, and that one\r\nof them should sail to Myus, to make the force which had returned from\r\nNaxos and was then there, and endeavour to seize the commanders who\r\nsailed in the ships.\r\n\r\n37. So Iatragoras was sent for this purpose and seized by craft Oliatos\r\nthe son of Ibanollis of Mylasa, and Histiaios the son of Tymnes of\r\nTermera, and Coës the son of Erxander, to whom Dareios had given\r\nMytilene as a gift, and Aristagoras the son of Heracleides of Kyme, and\r\nmany others; and then Aristagoras openly made revolt and devised all\r\nthat he could to the hurt of Dareios. And first he pretended to resign\r\nthe despotic power and give to Miletos equality, 23 in order that\r\nthe Milesians might be willing to revolt with him: then afterwards he\r\nproceeded to do this same thing in the rest of Ionia also; and some of\r\nthe despots he drove out, but those whom he had taken from the ships\r\nwhich had sailed with him to Naxis, these he surrendered, because he\r\ndesired to do a pleasure to their cities, delivering them over severally\r\nto that city from which each one came.\r\n\r\n38. Now the men of Mitylene, so soon as they received Coës into their\r\nhands, brought him out and stoned him to death; but the men of Kyme let\r\ntheir despot go, and so also most of the others let them go. Thus then\r\nthe despots were deposed in the various cities; and Aristagoras the\r\nMilesian, after having deposed the despots, bade each people appoint\r\ncommanders in their several cities, and then himself set forth as an\r\nenvoy to Lacedemon; for in truth it was necessary that he should find\r\nout some powerful alliance.\r\n\r\n39. Now at Sparta Anaxandrides the son of Leon was no longer surviving\r\nas king, but had brought his life to an end; and Cleomenes the son of\r\nAnaxandrides was holding the royal power, not having obtained it by\r\nmerit but by right of birth. For Anaxandrides had to wife his own\r\nsister's daughter and she was by him much beloved, but no children were\r\nborn to him by her. This being so, the Ephors summoned him before them\r\nand said: \"If thou dost not for thyself take thought in time, yet we\r\ncannot suffer this to happen, that the race of Eurysthenes should become\r\nextinct. Do thou therefore put away from thee the wife whom thou now\r\nhast, since, as thou knowest, she bears thee no children, and marry\r\nanother: and in doing so thou wilt please the Spartans.\" He made answer\r\nsaying that he would do neither of these two things, and that they did\r\nnot give him honourable counsel, in that they advised him to send away\r\nthe wife whom he had, though she had done him no wrong, and to take to\r\nhis house another; and in short he would not follow their advice.\r\n\r\n40. Upon this the Ephors and the Senators deliberated together and\r\nproposed to Anaxandrides as follows: \"Since then we perceive that thou\r\nart firmly attached to the wife whom thou now hast, consent to do this,\r\nand set not thyself against it, lest the Spartans take some counsel\r\nabout thee other than might be wished. We do not ask of thee the putting\r\naway of the wife whom thou hast; but do thou give to her all that\r\nthou givest now and at the same time take to thy house another wife in\r\naddition to this one, to bear thee children.\" When they spoke to him\r\nafter this manner, Anaxandrides consented, having two wives, a thing\r\nwhich was not by any means after the Spartan fashion.\r\n\r\n41. Then when no long time had elapsed, the wife who had come in\r\nafterwards bore this Cleomenes of whom we spoke; and just when she was\r\nbringing to the light an heir to the kingdom of the Spartans, the former\r\nwife, who had during the time before been childless, then by some means\r\nconceived, chancing to do so just at that time: and though she was in\r\ntruth with child, the kinsfolk of the wife who had come in afterwards,\r\nwhen they heard of it cried out against her and said that she was making\r\na vain boast, and that she meant to pass off another child as her own.\r\nSince then they made a great show of indignation, as the time was fast\r\ndrawing near, the Ephors being incredulous sat round and watched the\r\nwoman during the birth of her child: and she bore Dorieos and then\r\nstraightway conceived Leonidas and after him at once Cleombrotos,--nay,\r\nsome even say that Cleombrotos and Leonidas were twins. The wife however\r\nwho had born Cleomenes and had come in after the first wife, being\r\nthe daughter of Primetades the son of Demarmenos, did not bear a child\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n42. Now Cleomenes, it is said, was not quite in his right senses but on\r\nthe verge of madness, 24 while Dorieos was of all his equals in age\r\nthe first, and felt assured that he would obtain the kingdom by merit.\r\nSeeing then that he had this opinion, when Anaxandrides died and the\r\nLacedemonians followed the usual custom established the eldest, namely\r\nCleomenes, upon the throne, Dorieos being indignant and not thinking it\r\nfit that he should be a subject of Cleomenes, asked the Spartans to give\r\nhim a company of followers and led them out to found a colony, without\r\neither inquiring of the Oracle at Delphi to what land he should go to\r\nmake a settlement, or doing any of the things which are usually\r\ndone; but being vexed he sailed away with his ships to Libya, and the\r\nTheraians were his guides thither. Then having come to Kinyps 25 he made\r\na settlement in the fairest spot of all Libya, along the banks of the\r\nriver; but afterwards in the third year he was driven out from thence\r\nby the Macai and the Libyans 26 and the Carthaginians, and returned to\r\nPeloponnesus.\r\n\r\n43. Then Antichares a man of Eleon gave him counsel out of the oracles\r\nof Laïos to make a settlement at Heracleia 27 in Sicily, saying that the\r\nwhole land of Eryx belonged to the Heracleidai, since Heracles himself\r\nhad won it: and hearing this he went forthwith to Delphi to inquire of\r\nthe Oracle whether he would be able to conquer the land to which he was\r\nsetting forth; and the Pythian prophetess replied to him that he would\r\nconquer it. Dorieos therefore took with him the armament which he\r\nconducted before to Libya, and voyaged along the coast of Italy. 28\r\n\r\n44. Now at this time, the men of Sybaris say that they and their king\r\nTelys were about to make an expedition against Croton, and the men of\r\nCroton being exceedingly alarmed asked Dorieos to help them and obtained\r\ntheir request. So Dorieos joined them in an expedition against Sybaris\r\nand helped them to conquer Sybaris. This is what the men of Sybaris say\r\nof the doings of Dorieos and his followers; but those of Croton say that\r\nno stranger helped them in the war against the Sybarites except Callias\r\nalone, a diviner of Elis and one of the descendants of Iamos, and he in\r\nthe following manner:--he ran away, they say, from Telys the despot of\r\nthe Sybarites, when the sacrifices did not prove favourable, as he was\r\nsacrificing for the expedition against Croton, and so he came to them.\r\n\r\n45. Such, I say, are the tales which these tell, and they severally\r\nproduce as evidence of them the following facts:--the Sybarites point\r\nto a sacred enclosure and temple by the side of the dried-up bed of\r\nthe Crathis, 29 which they say that Dorieos, after he had joined in the\r\ncapture of the city, set up to Athene surnamed \"of the Crathis\"; and\r\nbesides they consider the death of Dorieos himself to be a very strong\r\nevidence, thinking that he perished because he acted contrary to the\r\noracle which was given to him; for if he had not done anything by the\r\nway but had continued to do that for which he was sent, he would have\r\nconquered the land of Eryx and having conquered it would have become\r\npossessor of it, and he and his army would not have perished. On the\r\nother hand the men of Croton declare that many things were granted in\r\nthe territory of Croton as special gifts to Callias the Eleisan, of\r\nwhich the descendants of Callias were still in possession down to my\r\ntime, and that nothing was granted to Dorieos or the descendants of\r\nDorieos: but if Dorieos had in fact helped them in the way with Sybaris,\r\nmany times as much, they say, would have been given to him as to\r\nCallias. These then are the evidences which the two sides produce, and\r\nwe may assent to whichever of them we think credible.\r\n\r\n46. Now there sailed with Dorieos others also of the Spartans, to be\r\njoint-founders with him of the colony, namely Thessalos and Paraibates\r\nand Keleas and Euryleon; and these when they had reached Sicily with all\r\ntheir armament, were slain, being defeated in battle by the Phenicians\r\nand the men of Egesta; and Euryleon only of the joint-founders survived\r\nthis disaster. This man then having collected the survivors of the\r\nexpedition, took possession of Minoa the colony of Selinus, and he\r\nhelped to free the men of Selinus from their despot Peithagoras.\r\nAfterwards, when he had deposed him, he laid hands himself upon the\r\ndespotism in Selinus and became sole ruler there, though but for a short\r\ntime; for the men of Selinus rose in revolt against him and slew\r\nhim, notwithstanding that he had fled for refuge to the altar of Zeus\r\nAgoraios. 30\r\n\r\n47. There had accompanied Dorieos also and died with him Philip the\r\nson of Butakides, a man of Croton, who having betrothed himself to the\r\ndaughter of Telys the Sybarite, became an exile from Croton; and then\r\nbeing disappointed of this marriage he sailed away to Kyrene, whence\r\nhe set forth and accompanied Dorieos with a trireme of his own, himself\r\nsupplying the expenses of the crew. Now this man had been a victor at\r\nthe Olympic games, and he was the most beautiful of the Hellenes who\r\nlived in his time; and on account of his beauty he obtained from the\r\nmen of Egesta that which none else ever obtained from them, for they\r\nestablished a hero-temple over his tomb, and they propitiate him still\r\nwith sacrifices.\r\n\r\n48. In this manner Dorieos ended his life: but if he had endured to be a\r\nsubject of Cleomenes and had remained in Sparta, he would have been king\r\nof Lacedemon; for Cleomenes reigned no very long time, and died leaving\r\nno son to succeed him but a daughter only, whose name was Gorgo.\r\n\r\n49. However, Aristagoras the despot of Miletos arrived at Sparta while\r\nCleomenes was reigning: and accordingly with him he came to speech,\r\nhaving, as the Lacedemonians say, a tablet of bronze, on which was\r\nengraved a map 31 of the whole Earth, with all the sea and all the\r\nrivers. And when he came to speech with Cleomenes he said to him as\r\nfollows: \"Marvel not, Cleomenes, at my earnestness in coming hither, for\r\nthe case is this.--That the sons of the Ionians should be slaves instead\r\nof free is a reproach and a grief most of all indeed to ourselves, but\r\nof all others most to you, inasmuch as ye are the leaders of Hellas. Now\r\ntherefore I entreat you by the gods of Hellas to rescue from slavery the\r\nIonians, who are your own kinsmen: and ye may easily achieve this, for\r\nthe Barbarians are not valiant in fight, whereas ye have attained to the\r\nhighest point of valour in that which relates to war: and their fighting\r\nis of this fashion, namely with bows and arrows and a short spear, and\r\nthey go into battle wearing trousers and with caps 32 on their heads.\r\nThus they are easily conquered. Then again they who occupy that\r\ncontinent have good things in such quantity as not all the other nations\r\nof the world together possess; first gold, then silver and bronze and\r\nembroidered garments and beasts of burden and slaves; all which ye might\r\nhave for yourselves, if ye so desired. And the nations moreover dwell\r\nin such order one after the other as I shall declare:--the Ionians here;\r\nand next to them the Lydians, who not only dwell in a fertile land, but\r\nare also exceedingly rich in gold and silver,\" 33--and as he said this\r\nhe pointed to the map of the Earth, which he carried with him engraved\r\nupon the tablet,--\"and here next to the Lydians,\" continued Aristagoras,\r\n\"are the Eastern Phrygians, who have both the greatest number of sheep\r\nand cattle 34 of any people that I know, and also the most abundant\r\ncrops. Next to the Phrygians are the Cappadokians, whom we call Syrians;\r\nand bordering upon them are the Kilikians, coming down to this 35 sea,\r\nin which lies the island of Cyprus here; and these pay five hundred\r\ntalents to the king for their yearly tribute. Next to these Kilikians\r\nare the Armenians, whom thou mayest see here, and these also have great\r\nnumbers of sheep and cattle. Next to the Armenians are the Matienians\r\noccupying this country here; and next to them is the land of Kissia\r\nhere, in which land by the banks of this river Choaspes is situated that\r\ncity of Susa where the great king has his residence, and where the money\r\nis laid up in treasuries. After ye have taken this city ye may then with\r\ngood courage enter into a contest with Zeus in the matter of wealth.\r\nNay, but can it be that ye feel yourselves bound to take upon you the\r\nrisk of 36 battles against Messenians and Arcadians and Argives, who are\r\nequally matched against you, for the sake of land which is not much in\r\nextent nor very fertile, and for confines which are but small, though\r\nthese peoples have neither gold nor silver at all, for the sake of which\r\ndesire incites one to fight and to die,--can this be, I say, and will\r\nye choose some other way now, when it is possible for you easily to have\r\nthe rule over all Asia?\" Aristagoras spoke thus, and Cleomenes answered\r\nhim saying: \"Guest-friend from Miletos, I defer my answer to thee until\r\nthe day after to-morrow.\" 37\r\n\r\n50. Thus far then they advanced at that time; and when the appointed\r\nday arrived for the answer, and they had come to the place agreed upon,\r\nCleomenes asked Aristagoras how many days' journey it was from the sea\r\nof the Ionians to the residence of the king. Now Aristagoras, who in\r\nother respects acted cleverly and imposed upon him well, in this point\r\nmade a mistake: for whereas he ought not to have told him the truth, at\r\nleast if he desired to bring the Spartans out to Asia, he said in fact\r\nthat it was a journey up from the sea of three months: and the other\r\ncutting short the rest of the account which Aristagoras had begun to\r\ngive of the way, said: \"Guest-friend from Miletos, get thee away from\r\nSparta before the sun has set; for thou speakest a word which sounds not\r\nwell in the ears of the Lacedemonians, desiring to take them a journey\r\nof three months from the sea.\"\r\n\r\n51. Cleomenes accordingly having so said went away to his house:\r\nbut Aristagoras took the suppliant's branch and went to the house of\r\nCleomenes; and having entered in as a suppliant, he bade Cleomenes send\r\naway the child and listen to him; for the daughter of Cleomenes was\r\nstanding by him, whose name was Gorgo, and this as it chanced was his\r\nonly child, being of the age now of eight or nine years. Cleomenes\r\nhowever bade him say that which he desired to say, and not to stop on\r\naccount of the child. Then Aristagoras proceeded to promise him money,\r\nbeginning with ten talents, if he would accomplish for him that for\r\nwhich he was asking; and when Cleomenes refused, Aristagoras went on\r\nincreasing the sums of money offered, until at last he had promised\r\nfifty talents, and at that moment the child cried out: \"Father, the\r\nstranger will do thee hurt, 38 if thou do not leave him and go.\"\r\nCleomenes, then, pleased by the counsel of the child, departed into\r\nanother room, and Aristagoras went away from Sparta altogether, and had\r\nno opportunity of explaining any further about the way up from the sea\r\nto the residence of the king.\r\n\r\n52. As regards this road the truth is as follows.--Everywhere there are\r\nroyal stages 39 and excellent resting-places, and the whole road runs\r\nthrough country which is inhabited and safe. Through Lydia and Phrygia\r\nthere extend twenty stages, amounting to ninety-four and a half leagues;\r\n40 and after Phrygia succeeds the river Halys, at which there is a gate\r\n4001 which one must needs pass through in order to cross the river, and\r\na strong guard-post is established there. Then after crossing over into\r\nCappadokia it is twenty-eight stages, being a hundred and four leagues,\r\nby this way to the borders of Kilikia; and on the borders of the\r\nKilikians you will pass through two several gates and go by two several\r\nguard-posts: then after passing through these it is three stages,\r\namounting to fifteen and a half leagues, to journey through Kilikia;\r\nand the boundary of Kilikia and Armenia is a navigable river called\r\nEuphrates. In Armenia the number of stages with resting-places is\r\nfifteen, and of leagues fifty-six and a half, and there is a guard-post\r\non the way: then from Armenia, when one enters the land of Matiene, 41\r\nthere are thirty-four stages, amounting to a hundred and thirty-seven\r\nleagues; and through this land flow four navigable rivers, which cannot\r\nbe crossed but by ferries, first the Tigris, then a second and third\r\ncalled both by the same name, 42 though they are not the same river nor\r\ndo they flow from the same region (for the first-mentioned of them flows\r\nfrom the Armenian land and the other 43 from that of the Matienians),\r\nand the fourth of the rivers is called Gyndes, the same which once Cyrus\r\ndivided into three hundred and sixty channels. 44 Passing thence into\r\nthe Kissian land, there are eleven stages, forty-two and a half leagues,\r\nto the river Choaspes, which is also a navigable stream; and upon this\r\nis built the city of Susa. The number of these stages amounts in all to\r\none hundred and eleven.\r\n\r\n53. This is the number of stages with resting-places, as one goes up\r\nfrom Sardis to Susa: and if the royal road has been rightly measured as\r\nregards leagues, and if the league 45 is equal to thirty furlongs, 46\r\n(as undoubtedly it is), the number of furlongs from Sardis to that which\r\nis called the palace of Memnon is thirteen thousand five hundred, the\r\nnumber of leagues being four hundred and fifty. So if one travels a\r\nhundred and fifty furlongs each day, just ninety days are spent on the\r\njourney. 47\r\n\r\n54. Thus the Milesian Aristagoras, when he told Cleomenes the\r\nLacedemonian that the journey up from the sea to the residence of the\r\nking was one of three months, spoke correctly: but if any one demands\r\na more exact statement yet than this, I will give him that also: for we\r\nought to reckon in addition to this the length of the road from Ephesos\r\nto Sardis; and I say accordingly that the whole number of furlongs from\r\nthe sea of Hellas to Susa (for by that name the city of Memnon is known)\r\nis fourteen thousand and forty; for the number of furlongs from Ephesos\r\nto Sardis is five hundred and forty: thus the three months' journey is\r\nlengthened by three days added.\r\n\r\n55. Aristagoras then being driven out of Sparta proceeded to Athens;\r\nwhich had been set free from the rule of despots in the way which I\r\nshall tell.--When Hipparchos the son of Peisistratos and brother of the\r\ndespot Hippias, after seeing a vision of a dream which signified it to\r\nhim plainly, 48 had been slain by Aristogeiton and Harmodios, who were\r\noriginally by descent Gephyraians, the Athenians continued for\r\nfour years after this to be despotically governed no less than\r\nformerly,--nay, even more.\r\n\r\n56. Now the vision of a dream which Hipparchos had was this:--in the\r\nnight before the Panathenaia it seemed to Hipparchos that a man came\r\nand stood by him, tall and of fair form, and riddling spoke to him these\r\nverses:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"With enduring soul as a lion endure unendurable evil:\r\n  No one of men who doth wrong shall escape from the judgment appointed.\"\r\n\r\nThese verses, as soon as it was day, he publicly communicated to the\r\ninterpreters of dreams; but afterwards he put away thought of the vision\r\n49 and began to take part in that procession during which he lost his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n57. Now the Gephyraians, of whom were those who murdered Hipparchos,\r\naccording to their own account were originally descended from Eretria;\r\nbut as I find by carrying inquiries back, they were Phenicians of those\r\nwho came with Cadmos to the land which is now called Boeotia, and they\r\ndwelt in the district of Tanagra, which they had had allotted to them\r\nin that land. Then after the Cadmeians had first been driven out by the\r\nArgives, these Gephyraians next were driven out by the Boeotians and\r\nturned then towards Athens: and the Athenians received them on certain\r\nfixed conditions to be citizens of their State, laying down rules that\r\nthey should be excluded from a number of things not worth mentioning\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n58. Now these Phenicians who came with Cadmos, of whom were the\r\nGephyraians, brought in among the Hellenes many arts when they settled\r\nin this land of Boeotia, and especially letters, which did not exist, as\r\nit appears to me, among the Hellenes before this time; and at first they\r\nbrought in those which are used by the Phenician race generally, but\r\nafterwards, as time went on, they changed with their speech the form of\r\nthe letters also. During this time the Ionians were the race of Hellenes\r\nwho dwelt near them in most of the places where they were; and these,\r\nhaving received letters by instruction of the Phenicians, changed their\r\nform slightly and so made use of them, and in doing so they declared\r\nthem to be called \"phenicians,\" as was just, seeing that the Phenicians\r\nhad introduced them into Hellas. Also the Ionians from ancient time call\r\npaper \"skins,\" because formerly, paper being scarce, they used skins of\r\ngoat and sheep; nay, even in my own time many of the Barbarians write on\r\nsuch skins.\r\n\r\n59. I myself too once saw Cadmeian characters in the temple of Ismenian\r\nApollo at Thebes of the Boeotians, engraved on certain 4901 tripods, and\r\nin most respects resembling the Ionic letters: one of these tripods has\r\nthe inscription,\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Me Amphitryon offered from land Teleboian returning:\" 50\r\n this inscription would be of an age contemporary  with Laïos\r\n the son of Labdacos, the son of Polydoros, the son of Cadmos.\r\n\r\n60. Another tripod says thus in hexameter rhythm:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Me did Scaios offer to thee, far-darting Apollo,\r\n  Victor in contest of boxing, a gift most fair in thine honour:\"\r\n\r\nnow Scaios would be the son of Hippocoön (at least if it were really he\r\nwho offered it, and not another with  the same name as the son of\r\nHippocoön), being of an age contemporary with OEdipus the son of Laïos:\r\n\r\n61. and the third tripod, also in hexameter rhythm, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Me Laodamas offered to thee, fair-aiming Apollo,\r\n  He, of his wealth, 51 being king, as a gift most fair in thine honor:\"\r\n\r\nnow it was in the reign of this very Laodamas the son of Eteocles that\r\nthe Cadmeians were driven out by the Argives and turned to go to the\r\nEnchelians; and the Gephyraians being then left behind were afterwards\r\nforced by the Boeotians to retire to Athens. Moreover they have temples\r\nestablished in Athens, in which the other Athenians have no part, and\r\nbesides others which are different from the rest, there is especially a\r\ntemple of Demeter Achaia and a celebration of her mysteries.\r\n\r\n62. I have told now of the vision of a dream seen by Hipparchos, and\r\nalso whence the Gephrynians were descended, of which race were the\r\nmurderers of Hipparchos; and in addition to this I must resume and\r\ncontinue the story which I was about to tell at first, how the Athenians\r\nwere freed from despots. When Hippias was despot and was dealing harshly\r\nwith the Athenians because of the death of Hipparchos, the Alcmaionidai,\r\nwho were of Athenian race and were fugitives from the sons of\r\nPeisistratos, 52 as they did not succeed in their attempt made together\r\nwith the other Athenian exiles to return by force, but met with great\r\ndisaster when they attempted to return and set Athens free, after they\r\nhad fortified Leipsydrion which is above Paionia,--these Alomaionidai\r\nafter that, still devising every means against the sons of Peisistratos,\r\naccepted the contract to build and complete the temple at Delphi, that\r\nnamely which now exists but then did not as yet: and being wealthy and\r\nmen of repute already from ancient time, they completed the temple in\r\na manner more beautiful than the plan required, and especially in this\r\nrespect, that having agreed to make the temple of common limestone, 53\r\nthey built the front parts of it in Parian marble.\r\n\r\n63. So then, as the Athenians say, these men being settled at Delphi\r\npersuaded the Pythian prophetess by gifts of money, that whenever men of\r\nthe Spartans should come to inquire of the Oracle, either privately\r\nor publicly sent, she should propose to them to set Athens free. The\r\nLacedemonians therefore, since the same utterance was delivered to them\r\non all occasions, sent Anchimolios the son of Aster, who was of repute\r\namong their citizens, with an army to drive out the sons of Peisistratos\r\nfrom Athens, although these were very closely connected with them by\r\nguest-friendship; for they held that the concerns of the god 5301 should\r\nbe preferred to those of men: and this force they sent by sea in ships.\r\nHe therefore, having put in to shore at Phaleron, disembarked his army;\r\nbut the sons of Peisistratos being informed of this beforehand called\r\nin to their aid an auxiliary force from Thessaly, for they had made an\r\nalliance with the Thessalians; and the Thessalians at their request\r\nsent by public resolution a body of a thousand horse and also their king\r\nKineas, a man of Conion. 54 So having obtained these as allies, the sons\r\nof Peisistratos contrived as follows:--they cut down the trees in the\r\nplain of Phaleron and made this district fit for horsemen to ride over,\r\nand after that they sent the cavalry to attack the enemy's camp,\r\nwho falling upon it slew (besides many others of the Lacedemonians)\r\nAnchimolios himself also: and the survivors of them they shut up in\r\ntheir ships. Such was the issue of the first expedition from Lacedemon:\r\nand the burial-place of Anchimolios is at Alopecai in Attica, near the\r\ntemple of Heracles which is at Kynosarges.\r\n\r\n64. After this the Lacedemonians equipped a larger expedition and sent\r\nit forth against Athens; and they appointed to be commander of the army\r\ntheir king Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides, and sent it this time\r\nnot by sea but by land. With these, when they had invaded the land of\r\nAttica, first the Thessalian horse engaged battle; and in no long time\r\nthey were routed and there fell of them more than forty men; so the\r\nsurvivors departed without more ado and went straight back to Thessaly.\r\nThen Cleomenes came to the city together with those of the Athenians\r\nwho desired to be free, and began to besiege the despots shut up in the\r\nPelasgian wall.\r\n\r\n65. And the Lacedemonians would never have captured the sons of\r\nPeisistratos at all; for they on their side had no design to make a long\r\nblockade, and the others were well provided with food and drink; so that\r\nthey would have gone away back to Sparta after besieging them for a few\r\ndays only: but as it was, a thing happened just at this time which was\r\nunfortunate for those, and at the same time of assistance to these;\r\nfor the children of the sons of Peisistratos were captured, while being\r\nsecretly removed out of the country: and when this happened, all their\r\nmatters were thereby cast into confusion, and they surrendered receiving\r\nback their children on the terms which the Athenians desired, namely\r\nthat they should depart out of Attica within five days. After this they\r\ndeparted out of the country and went to Sigeion on the Scamander, after\r\ntheir family had ruled over the Athenians for six-and-thirty years.\r\nThese also were originally Pylians and sons of Neleus, descended from\r\nthe same ancestors as the family of Codros and Melanthos, who had\r\nformerly become kings of Athens being settlers from abroad. Hence too\r\nHippocrates had given to his son the name of Peisistratos as a memorial,\r\ncalling him after Peisistratos the son of Nestor.\r\n\r\nThus the Athenians were freed from despots; and the things worthy to be\r\nnarrated which they did or suffered after they were liberated, up to the\r\ntime when Ionia revolted from Dareios and Aristagoras the Milesian\r\ncame to Athens and asked them to help him, these I will set forth first\r\nbefore I proceed further.\r\n\r\n66. Athens, which even before that time was great, then, after having\r\nbeen freed from despots, became gradually yet greater; and in it two men\r\nexercised power, namely Cleisthenes a descendant of Alcmaion, the same\r\nwho is reported to have bribed the Pythian prophetess, and Isagoras,\r\nthe son of Tisander, of a family which was highly reputed, but of his\r\noriginal descent I am not able to declare; his kinsmen however offer\r\nsacrifices to the Carian Zeus. These men came to party strife for power;\r\nand then Cleisthenes was being worsted in the struggle, he made common\r\ncause with the people. After this he caused the Athenians to be in ten\r\ntribes, who were formerly in four; and he changed the names by which\r\nthey were called after the sons of Ion, namely Geleon, Aigicoreus,\r\nArgades, and Hoples, and invented for them names taken from other\r\nheroes, all native Athenians except Ajax, whom he added as a neighbour\r\nand ally, although he was no Athenian.\r\n\r\n67. Now in these things it seems to me that this Cleisthenes was\r\nimitating his mother's father Cleisthenes the despot of Sikyon: for\r\nCleisthenes when he went to war with Argos first caused to cease in\r\nSikyon the contests of rhapsodists, which were concerned with the\r\npoems of Homer, because Argives and Argos are celebrated in them almost\r\neverywhere; then secondly, since there was (as still there is) in the\r\nmarket-place itself of the Sikyonians a hero-temple of Adrastos the son\r\nof Talaos, Cleisthenes had a desire to cast him forth out of the land,\r\nbecause he was an Argive. So having come to Delphi he consulted the\r\nOracle as to whether he should cast out Adrastos; and the Pythian\r\nprophetess answered him saying that Adrastos was king of the Sikyonians,\r\nwhereas he was a stoner 55 of them. So since the god did not permit him\r\nto do this, he went away home and considered means by which Adrastos\r\nshould be brought to depart of his own accord: and when he thought that\r\nhe had discovered them, he sent to Thebes in Boeotia and said that he\r\ndesired to introduce into his city Melanippos the son of Astacos, and\r\nthe Thebans gave him leave. So Cleisthenes introduced Melanippos into\r\nhis city, and appointed for him a sacred enclosure within the precincts\r\nof the City Hall 56 itself, and established him there in the strongest\r\nposition. Now Cleisthenes introduced Melanippos (for I must relate this\r\nalso) because he was the greatest enemy of Adrastos, seeing that he had\r\nkilled both his brother Mekisteus and his son-in-law Tydeus: and when he\r\nhad appointed the sacred enclosure for him, he took away the sacrifices\r\nand festivals of Adrastos and gave them to Melanippos. Now the\r\nSikyonians were accustomed to honour Adrastos with very great honours;\r\nfor this land was formerly the land of Polybos, and Adrastos was\r\ndaughter's son to Polybos, and Polybos dying without sons gave his\r\nkingdom to Adrastos: the Sikyonians then not only gave other honours\r\nto Adrastos, but also with reference to his sufferings they specially\r\nhonoured him with tragic choruses, not paying the honour to Dionysos but\r\nto Adrastos. Cleisthenes however gave back the choruses to Dionysos, and\r\nthe other rites besides this he gave to Melannipos.\r\n\r\n68. Thus he had done to Adrastos; and he also changed the names of the\r\nDorian tribes, in order that the Sikyonians might not have the same\r\ntribes as the Argives; in which matter he showed great contempt of the\r\nSikyonians, for the names he gave were taken from the names of a pig\r\nand an ass by changing only the endings, except in the case of his own\r\ntribe, to which he gave a name from his own rule. These last then were\r\ncalled Archelaoi, 57 while of the rest those of one tribe were called\r\nHyatai, 58 of another Oneatai, 59 and of the remaining tribe Choireatai.\r\n60 These names of tribes were used by the men of Sikyon not only in the\r\nreign of Cleisthenes, but also beyond that for sixty years after his\r\ndeath; then however they considered the matter and changed them into\r\nHylleis, Pamphyloi, and Dymanatai, adding to these a fourth, to which\r\nthey gave the name Aigialeis after Aigialeus the son of Adrastos.\r\n\r\n69. Thus had the Cleisthenes of Sikyon done: and the Athenian\r\nCleisthenes, who was his daughter's son and was called after him,\r\ndespising, as I suppose, the Ionians, as he the Dorians, imitated his\r\nnamesake Cleisthenes in order that the Athenians might not have the same\r\ntribes as the Ionians: for when at the time of which we speak he added\r\nto his own party the whole body of the common people of the Athenians,\r\nwhich in former time he had despised, 61 he changed the names of the\r\ntribes and made them more in number than they had been; he made in fact\r\nten rulers of tribes instead of four, and by tens also he distributed\r\nthe demes in the tribes; and having added the common people to his party\r\nhe was much superior to his opponents.\r\n\r\n70. Then Isagoras, as he was being worsted in his turn, contrived a\r\nplan in opposition to him, that is to say, he called in Cleomenes the\r\nLacedemonian to help him, who had been a guest-friend to himself since\r\nthe siege of the sons of Peisistratos; moreover Cleomenes was accused\r\nof being intimate with the wife of Isagoras. First then Cleomenes sent\r\na herald to Athens demanding the expulsion of Cleisthenes and with him\r\nmany others of the Athenians, calling them the men who were under the\r\ncurse: 62 this message he sent by instruction of Isagoras, for the\r\nAlcmaionidai and their party were accused of the murder to which\r\nreference was thus made, while he and his friends had no part in it.\r\n\r\n71. Now the men of the Athenians who were \"under the curse\" got this\r\nname as follows:--there was one Kylon among the Athenians, a man who\r\nhad gained the victory at the Olympic games: this man behaved with\r\narrogance, wishing to make himself despot; and having formed for himself\r\nan association of men of his own age, he endeavoured to seize the\r\nAcropolis: but not being able to get possession of it, he sat down as a\r\nsuppliant before the image of the goddess. 63 These men were taken from\r\ntheir place as suppliants by the presidents of the naucraries, who then\r\nadministered affairs at Athens, on the condition that they should be\r\nliable to any penalty short of death; and the Alcmaionidai are accused\r\nof having put them to death. This had occurred before the time of\r\nPeisistratos.\r\n\r\n72. Now when Cleomenes sent demanding the expulsion of Cleisthenes and\r\nof those under the curse, Cleisthenes himself retired secretly; but\r\nafter that nevertheless Cleomenes appeared in Athens with no very\r\nlarge force, and having arrived he proceeded to expel as accursed seven\r\nhundred Athenian families, of which Isagoras had suggested to him the\r\nnames. Having done this he next endeavoured to dissolve the Senate, and\r\nhe put the offices of the State into the hands of three hundred, who\r\nwere the partisans of Isagoras. The Senate however making opposition,\r\nand not being willing to submit, Cleomenes with Isagoras and his\r\npartisans seized the Acropolis. Then the rest of the Athenians joined\r\ntogether by common consent and besieged them for two days; and on the\r\nthird day so many of them as were Lacedemonians departed out of the\r\ncountry under a truce. Thus was accomplished for Cleomenes the ominous\r\nsaying which was uttered to him: for when he had ascended the Acropolis\r\nwith the design of taking possession of it, he was going to the\r\nsanctuary of the goddess, as to address her in prayer; but the priestess\r\nstood up from her seat before he had passed through the door, and said,\r\n\"Lacedemonian stranger, go back and enter not into the temple, for it is\r\nnot lawful for Dorians to pass in hither.\" He said: \"Woman, I am not\r\na Dorian, but an Achaian.\" So then, paying no attention to the ominous\r\nspeech, he made his attempt and then was expelled again with the\r\nLacedemonians; but the rest of the men the Athenians laid in bonds to\r\nbe put to death, and among them Timesitheos the Delphian, with regard to\r\nwhom I might mention very great deeds of strength and courage which he\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\n73. These then having been thus laid in bonds were put to death; and the\r\nAthenians after this sent for Cleisthenes to return, and also for the\r\nseven hundred families which had been driven out by Cleomenes: and\r\nthen they sent envoys to Sardis, desiring to make an alliance with\r\nthe Persians; for they were well assured that the Lacedemonians and\r\nCleomenes had been utterly made their foes. So when these envoys had\r\narrived at Sardis and were saying that which they had been commanded\r\nto say, Artaphrenes the son of Hystaspes, the governor of Sardis, asked\r\nwhat men these were who requested to be allies of the Persians, and\r\nwhere upon the earth they dwelt; and having heard this from the envoys,\r\nhe summed up his answer to them thus, saying that if the Athenians\r\nwere willing to give earth and water to Dareios, he was willing to make\r\nalliance with them, but if not, he bade them begone: and the envoys\r\ntaking the matter upon themselves said that they were willing to do so,\r\nbecause they desired to make the alliance.\r\n\r\n74. These, when they returned to their own land, were highly censured:\r\nand Cleomenes meanwhile, conceiving that he had been outrageously dealt\r\nwith by the Athenians both with words and with deeds, was gathering\r\ntogether an army from the whole of the Peloponnese, not declaring the\r\npurpose for which he was gathering it, but desiring to take vengeance on\r\nthe people of the Athenians, and intending to make Isagoras despot; for\r\nhe too had come out of the Acropolis together with Cleomenes. Cleomenes\r\nthen with a large army entered Eleusis, while at the same time the\r\nBoeotians by agreement with him captured Oinoe and Hysiai, the demes\r\nwhich lay upon the extreme borders of Attica, and the Chalkidians on the\r\nother side invaded and began to ravage various districts of Attica. The\r\nAthenians then, though attacked on more sides than one, thought that\r\nthey would remember the Boeotians and Chalkidians afterwards, and\r\narrayed themselves against the Peloponnesians who were in Eleusis.\r\n\r\n75. Then as the armies were just about the join battle, the Corinthians\r\nfirst, considering with themselves that they were not acting rightly,\r\nchanged their minds and departed; and after that Demaratos the son of\r\nAriston did the same, who was king of the Spartans as well as Cleomenes,\r\nthough he had joined with him in leading the army out from Lacedemon and\r\nhad not been before this at variance with Cleomenes. In consequence\r\nof this dissension a law was laid down at Sparta that it should not be\r\npermitted, when an army went out, that both the kings should go with\r\nit, for up to this time both used to go with it, and that as one of the\r\nkings was set free from service, so one of the sons of Tyndareus 64\r\nalso should be left behind; for before this time both of these two were\r\ncalled upon by them for help and went with the armies.\r\n\r\n76. At this time then in Eleusis the rest of the allies, seeing that the\r\nkings of the Lacedemonians did not agree and also that the Corinthians\r\nhad deserted their place in the ranks, themselves too departed and got\r\nthem away quickly. And this was the fourth time that the Dorians had\r\ncome to Attica, twice having invaded it to make war against it, and\r\ntwice to help the mass of the Athenian people,--first when they at the\r\nsame time colonised Megara (this expedition may rightly be designated as\r\ntaking place when Codros was king of the Athenians), for the second and\r\nthird times when they came making expeditions from Sparta to drive out\r\nthe sons of Peisistratos, and fourthly on this occasion, when Cleomenes\r\nat the head of the Peloponnesians invaded Eleusis: thus the Dorians\r\ninvaded Athens then for the fourth time.\r\n\r\n77. This army then having been ingloriously broken up, the Athenians\r\nafter that, desiring to avenge themselves, made expedition first against\r\nthe Chalkidians; and the Boeotians came to the Euripos to help the\r\nChalkidians. The Athenians, therefore, seeing those who had come\r\nto help, 6401 resolved first to attack the Boeotians before the\r\nChalkidians. Accordingly they engaged battle with the Boeotians, and\r\nhad much the better of them, and after having slain very many they\r\ntook seven hundred of them captive. On this very same day the Athenians\r\npassed over into Euboea and engaged battle with the Chalkidians as well;\r\nand having conquered these also, they left four thousand holders of\r\nallotments in the land belonging to the \"Breeders of Horses\": 65 now the\r\nwealthier of the Chalkidians were called the Breeders of Horses. And\r\nas many of them as they took captive, they kept in confinement together\r\nwith the Boeotians who had been captured, bound with fetters; and then\r\nafter a time they let them go, having fixed their ransom at two pounds\r\nof silver apiece: 66 but their fetters, in which they had been bound,\r\nthey hung up on the Acropolis; and these were still existing even to my\r\ntime hanging on walls which had been scorched with fire by the Mede, 67\r\nand just opposite the sanctuary which lies towards the West. The tenth\r\npart of the ransom also they dedicated for an offering, and made of it a\r\nfour-horse chariot of bronze, which stands on the left hand as you enter\r\nthe Propylaia in the Acropolis, and on it is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Matched in the deeds of war with the tribes of Boeotia and Chalkis\r\n    The sons of Athens prevailed, conquered and tamed them in fight:\r\n  In chains of iron and darkness they quenched their insolent spirit;\r\n    And to Athene present these, of their ransom a tithe.\"\r\n\r\n78. The Athenians accordingly increased in power; and it is evident, not\r\nby one instance only but in every way, that Equality 68 is an excellent\r\nthing, since the Athenians while they were ruled by despots were not\r\nbetter in war that any of those who dwelt about them, whereas after they\r\nhad got rid of despots they became far the first. This proves that when\r\nthey were kept down they were wilfully slack, because they were working\r\nfor a master, whereas when they had been set free each one was eager to\r\nachieve something for himself.\r\n\r\n79. These then were faring thus: and the Thebans after this sent to the\r\ngod, desiring to be avenged on the Athenians; the Pythian prophetess\r\nhowever said that vengeance was not possible for them by their own\r\nstrength alone, but bade them report the matter to the \"many-voiced\"\r\nand ask help of those who were \"nearest\" to them. So when those who were\r\nsent to consult the Oracle returned, they made a general assembly and\r\nreported the oracle; and then the Thebans heard them say that they were\r\nto ask help of those who were nearest to them, they said: \"Surely\r\nthose who dwell nearest to us are the men of Tanagra and Coroneia and\r\nThespiai; and these always fight zealously on our side and endure the\r\nwar with us to the end: what need is there that we ask of these? Rather\r\nperhaps that is not the meaning of the oracle.\"\r\n\r\n80. While they commented upon it thus, at length one perceived \"that\r\nwhich the oracle means to tell us. Asopos is said to have had two\r\ndaughters born to him, Thebe and Egina; and as these are sisters, I\r\nthink that the god gave us for answer that we should ask the men of\r\nEgina to become our helpers.\" Then as there seemed to be no opinion\r\nexpressed which was better than this, they sent forthwith and asked\r\nthe men of Egina to help them, calling upon them in accordance with the\r\noracle; and they, when these made request, said that they sent with them\r\nthe sons of Aiacos to help them.\r\n\r\n81. After that the Thebans, having made an attempt with the alliance\r\nof the sons of Aiacos and having been roughly handled by the Athenians,\r\nsent again and gave them back the sons of Aiacos and asked them for men.\r\nSo the Eginetans, exalted by great prosperity and calling to mind an\r\nancient grudge against the Athenians, then on the request of the Thebans\r\ncommenced a war against the Athenians without notice: for while the\r\nAthenians were intent on the Boeotians, they sailed against them to\r\nAttica with ships of war, and they devastated Phaleron and also many\r\ndemes in the remainder of the coast region, and so doing they deeply\r\nstirred the resentment of the Athenians. 69\r\n\r\n82. Now the grudge which was due beforehand from the Eginetans to the\r\nAthenians came about from a beginning which was as follows:--The land\r\nof the Epidaurians yielded to its inhabitants no fruit; and accordingly\r\nwith reference to this calamity the Epidaurians went to inquire at\r\nDelphi, and the Pythian prophetess bade them set up images of Damia and\r\nAuxesia, and said that when they had set up these, they would meet with\r\nbetter fortune. The Epidaurians then asked further whether they should\r\nmake images of bronze or of stone; and the prophetess bade them not use\r\neither of these, but make them of the wood of a cultivated olive-tree.\r\nThe Epidaurians therefore asked the Athenians to allow them to cut for\r\nthemselves an olive-tree, since they thought that their olives were the\r\nmost sacred; nay some say that at that time there were no olives in any\r\npart of the earth except at Athens. The Athenians said that they would\r\nallow them on condition that they should every year bring due offerings\r\nto Athene Polias 70 and to Erechtheus. The Epidaurians, then, having\r\nagreed to these terms, obtained that which they asked, and they made\r\nimages out of these olive-trees and set them up: and their land bore\r\nfruit and they continued to fulfil towards the Athenians that which they\r\nhad agreed to do.\r\n\r\n83. Now during this time and also before this the Eginetans were subject\r\nto the Epidaurians, and besides other things they were wont to pass over\r\nto Epidauros to have their disputes with one another settled by law: 71\r\nbut after this time they built for themselves ships and made revolt\r\nfrom the Epidaurians, moved thereto by wilfulness. So as they were at\r\nvariance with them, they continued to inflict damage on them, since in\r\nfact they had command of the sea, and especially they stole away from\r\nthem these images of Damia and Auxesia, and they brought them and set\r\nthem up in the inland part of their country at a place called Oia, which\r\nis about twenty furlongs distant from their city. Having set them up\r\nin this spot they worshipped them with sacrifices and choruses of women\r\naccompanied with scurrilous jesting, ten men being appointed for each of\r\nthe deities to provide the choruses: and the choruses spoke evil of no\r\nman, but only of the women of the place. Now the Epidaurians also had\r\nthe same rites; and they have also rites which may not be divulged.\r\n\r\n84. These images then having been stolen, the Epidaurians no longer\r\ncontinued to fulfil towards the Athenians that which they had agreed.\r\nThe Athenians accordingly sent and expressed displeasure to the\r\nEpidaurians; and they declared saying that they were doing no wrong; for\r\nduring the time when they had the images in their country they continued\r\nto fulfil that which they had agreed upon, but since they had been\r\ndeprived of them, it was not just that they should make the offerings\r\nany more; and they bade them demand these from the men of Egina, who had\r\nthe images. So the Athenians sent to Egina and demanded the images back;\r\nbut the Eginetans said that they had nothing to do with the Athenians.\r\n\r\n85. The Athenians then report that in one single trireme were despatched\r\nthose of their citizens who were sent by the State after this demand;\r\nwho having come to Egina, attempted to tear up from off their pedestals\r\nthe images, (alleging that they were made of wood which belonged to the\r\nAthenians), in order to carry them back with them: but not being able\r\nto get hold of them in this manner (say the Athenians) they threw ropes\r\nround them and were pulling them, when suddenly, as they pulled, thunder\r\ncame on and an earthquake at the same time with the thunder; and the\r\ncrew of the trireme who were pulling were made beside themselves by\r\nthese, and being brought to this condition they killed one another as if\r\nthey were enemies, until at last but one of the whole number was left;\r\nand he returned alone to Phaleron.\r\n\r\n86. Thus the Athenians report that it came to pass: but the Eginetans\r\nsay that it was not with a single ship that the Athenians came; for\r\na single ship, and even a few more than one, they could have easily\r\nrepelled, even if they had not happened to have ships of their own: but\r\nthey say that the Athenians sailed upon their country with a large fleet\r\nof ships, and they gave way before them and did not fight a sea-battle.\r\nThey cannot however declare with certainty whether they gave way thus\r\nbecause they admitted that they were not strong enough to fight the\r\nbattle by sea, or because they intended to do something of the kind\r\nwhich they actually did. The Athenians then, they say, as no one met\r\nthem in fight, landed from their ships and made for the images; but\r\nnot being able to tear them up from their pedestals, at last they threw\r\nropes round them and began to pull, until the images, as they were being\r\npulled, did both the same thing (and here they report something which\r\nI cannot believe, but some other man may), for they say that the images\r\nfell upon their knees to them and that they continue to be in that\r\nposition ever since this time. The Athenians, they say, were doing thus;\r\nand meanwhile they themselves (say the Eginetans), being informed that\r\nthe Athenians were about to make an expedition against them, got the\r\nArgives to help them; and just when the Athenians had disembarked upon\r\nthe Eginetan land, the Argives had come to their rescue, and not having\r\nbeen perceived when they passed over from Epidauros to the island, they\r\nfell upon the Athenians before these had heard anything of the matter,\r\ncutting them off secretly from the way to their ships; and at this\r\nmoment it was that the thunder and the earthquake came upon them.\r\n\r\n87. This is the report which is given by the Argives and Eginetans both,\r\nand it is admitted by the Athenians also that but one alone of them\r\nsurvived and came back to Attica: only the Argives say that this one\r\nremained alive from destruction wrought by them upon the army of\r\nAthens, while the Athenians say that the divine power was the destroyer.\r\nHowever, even this one man did not remain alive, but perished, they say,\r\nin the following manner:--when he returned to Athens he reported the\r\ncalamity which had happened; and the wives of the men who had gone on\r\nthe expedition to Egina, hearing it and being very indignant that he\r\nalone of all had survived, came round this man and proceeded to stab him\r\nwith the brooches of their mantles, each one of them asking of him where\r\nher husband was. Thus he was slain; and to the Athenians it seemed\r\nthat the deed of the women was a much more terrible thing even than\r\nthe calamity which had happened; and not knowing, it is said, how they\r\nshould punish the women in any other way, they changed their fashion of\r\ndress to that of Ionia,--for before this the women of the Athenians wore\r\nDorian dress, very like that of Corinth,--they changed it therefore to\r\nthe linen tunic, in order that they might not have use for brooches.\r\n\r\n88. In truth however this fashion of dress is not Ionian originally but\r\nCarian, for the old Hellenic fashion of dress for women was universally\r\nthe same as that which we now call Dorian. Moreover it is said that with\r\nreference to these events the Argives and Eginetans made it a custom\r\namong themselves in both countries 72 to have the brooches made half\r\nas large again as the size which was then established in use, and that\r\ntheir women should offer brooches especially in the temple of these\r\ngoddesses, 73 and also that they should carry neither pottery of Athens\r\nnor anything else of Athenian make to the temple, but that it should be\r\nthe custom for the future to drink there from pitchers made in the lands\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n89. The women of the Argives and Eginetans from this time onwards\r\nbecause of the quarrel with the Athenians continued to wear brooches\r\nlarger than before, and still do so even to my time; and the origin of\r\nthe enmity of the Athenians towards the Eginetans came in the manner\r\nwhich has been said. So at this time, when the Thebans invaded them, the\r\nEginetans readily came to the assistance of the Boeotians, calling to\r\nmind what occurred about the images. The Eginetans then were laying\r\nwaste, as I have said, the coast regions of Attica; and when the\r\nAthenians were resolved to make an expedition against the Eginetans,\r\nan oracle came to them from Delphi bidding them stay for thirty years\r\nreckoned from the time of the wrong done by the Eginetans, and in the\r\none-and-thirtieth year to appoint a sacred enclosure for Aiacos and then\r\nto begin the war against the Eginetans, and they would succeed as they\r\ndesired; but if they should make an expedition against them at once,\r\nthey would suffer in the meantime very much evil and also inflict very\r\nmuch, but at last they would subdue them. When the Athenians heard the\r\nreport of this, they appointed a sacred enclosure for Aiacos, namely\r\nthat which is now established close to the market-place, but they could\r\nnot endure to hear that they must stay for thirty years, when they had\r\nsuffered injuries from the Eginetans.\r\n\r\n90. While however they were preparing to take vengeance, a matter arose\r\nfrom the Lacedemonians which provided a hindrance to them: for the\r\nLacedemonians, having learnt that which had been contrived by the\r\nAlcmaionidai with respect to the Pythian prophetess, and that which had\r\nbeen contrived by the Pythian prophetess against themselves and the sons\r\nof Peisistratos, were doubly grieved, not only because they had driven\r\nout into exile men who were their guest-friends, but also because after\r\nthey had done this no gratitude was shown to them by the Athenians.\r\nMoreover in addition to this, they were urged on by the oracles which\r\nsaid that many injuries would be suffered by them from the Athenians;\r\nof which oracles they had not been aware of before, but they had come to\r\nknow them, since Cleomenes had brought them to Sparta. In fact Cleomenes\r\nhad obtained from the Acropolis of the Athenians those oracles which the\r\nsons of Peisistratos possessed before and had left in the temple when\r\nthey were driven out; and Cleomenes recovered them after they had been\r\nleft behind.\r\n\r\n91. At this time, then, when the Lacedemonians had recovered the oracles\r\nand when they saw that the Athenians were increasing in power and were\r\nnot at all willing to submit to them, observing that the Athenian race\r\nnow that it was free was becoming 74 a match for their own, whereas when\r\nheld down by despots it was weak and ready to be ruled,--perceiving, I\r\nsay, all these things, they sent for Hippias the son of Peisistratos to\r\ncome from Sigeion on the Hellespont, whither the family of Peisistratos\r\ngo for refuge; 75 and when Hippias had come upon the summons, the\r\nSpartans sent also for envoys to come from their other allies and spoke\r\nto them as follows: \"Allies, we are conscious within ourselves that we\r\nhave not acted rightly; for incited by counterfeit oracles we drove out\r\ninto exile men who were very closely united with us as guest-friends and\r\nwho undertook the task of rendering Athens submissive to us, and then\r\nafter having done this we delivered over the State to a thankless\r\npopulace, which so soon as it had raised its head, having been freed by\r\nour means drove out us and our king with wanton outrage; and now exalted\r\nwith pride 76 it is increasing in power, so that the neighbours of these\r\nmen first of all, that is the Boeotians and Chalkidians, have already\r\nlearnt, and perhaps some others also will afterwards learn, that they\r\ncommitted an error. 7601 As however we erred in doing those things of\r\nwhich we have spoken, we will try now to take vengeance on them, going\r\nthither together with you; 77 since it was for this very purpose that we\r\nsent for Hippias, whom ye see here, and for you also, to come from your\r\ncities, in order that with common counsel and a common force we might\r\nconduct him to Athens and render back to him that which we formerly took\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\n92. Thus they spoke; but the majority of the allies did not approve of\r\ntheir words. The rest however kept silence, but the Corinthian Socles 78\r\nspoke as follows: (a) \"Surely now the heaven shall be below the earth,\r\nand the earth raised up on high above the heaven, and men shall have\r\ntheir dwelling in the sea, and fishes shall have that habitation which\r\nmen had before, seeing that ye, Lacedemonians, are doing away with free\r\ngovernments 79 and are preparing to bring back despotism again into our\r\ncities, than which there is no more unjust or more murderous thing\r\namong men. For if in truth this seems to you to be good, namely that\r\nthe cities should be ruled by despots, do ye yourselves first set up a\r\ndespot in your own State, and then endeavour to establish them also for\r\nothers: but as it is, ye are acting unfairly towards your allies, seeing\r\nthat ye have had no experience of despots yourselves and provide with\r\nthe greatest care at Sparta that this may never come to pass. If\r\nhowever ye had had experience of it, as we have had, ye would be able\r\nto contribute juster opinions of it than at present. (b) For the\r\nestablished order of the Corinthian State was this:--the government was\r\nan oligarchy, and the oligarchs, who were called Bacchiadai, had control\r\nover the State and made marriages among themselves. 80 Now one of these\r\nmen, named Amphion, had a daughter born to him who was lame, and her\r\nname was Labda. This daughter, since none of the Bacchiadai wished to\r\nmarry her, was taken to wife by Aëtion the son of Echecrates, who was of\r\nthe deme of Petra, but by original descent a Lapith and of the race of\r\nCaineus. Neither from this wife nor from another were children born to\r\nhim, therefore he set out to Delphi to inquire about offspring; and as\r\nhe entered, forthwith the prophetess addressed him in these lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"'Much to be honoured art thou, yet none doth render thee honour. 81\r\n  Labda conceives, and a rolling rock will she bear, which shall ruin\r\n  Down on the heads of the kings, and with chastisement visit Corinthos.'\r\n\r\nThis answer given to Aëtion was by some means reported to the\r\nBacchiadai, to whom the oracle which had come to Corinth before this was\r\nnot intelligible, an oracle which had reference to the same thing as\r\nthat of Aëtion and said thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"'An eagle conceives in the rocks 82 and shall bear a ravening lion,\r\n  Strong and fierce to devour, who the knees of many shall loosen.\r\n  Ponder this well in your minds, I bid you, Corinthians, whose dwelling\r\n  Lies about fair Peirene's spring and in craggy Corinthos.' 83\r\n\r\n(c) This oracle, I say, having come before to the Bacchiadai was\r\nobscure; but afterwards when they heard that which had come to Aëtion,\r\nforthwith they understood the former also, that it was in accord with\r\nthat of Aëtion; and understanding this one also they kept quiet,\r\ndesiring to destroy the offspring which should be born to Aëtion. Then,\r\nso soon as his wife bore a child, they sent ten of their own number to\r\nthe deme in which Aëtion had his dwelling, to slay the child; and when\r\nthese had come to Petra and had passed into the court of Aëtion's house,\r\nthey asked for the child; and Labda, not knowing anything of the purpose\r\nfor which they had come, and supposing them to be asking for the child\r\non account of friendly feeling towards its father, brought it and placed\r\nit in the hands of one of them. Now they, it seems, had resolved by the\r\nway that the first of them who received the child should dash it upon\r\nthe ground. However, when Labda brought and gave it, it happened by\r\ndivine providence that the child smiled at the man who had received it;\r\nand when he perceived this, a feeling of compassion prevented him from\r\nkilling it, and having this compassion he delivered it to the next man,\r\nand he to the third. Thus it passed through the hands of all the ten,\r\ndelivered from one to another, since none of them could bring himself to\r\ndestroy its life. So they gave the child back to its mother and went\r\nout; and then standing by the doors they abused and found fault with one\r\nanother, laying blame especially on the one who had first received the\r\nchild, because he had not done according to that which had been\r\nresolved; until at last after some time they determined again to enter\r\nand all to take a share in the murder. (d) From the offspring of Aëtion\r\nhowever it was destined that evils should spring up for Corinth: for\r\nLabda was listening to all this as she stood close by the door, and\r\nfearing lest they should change their mind and take the child a second\r\ntime and kill it, she carried it and concealed it in the place which\r\nseemed to her the least likely to be discovered, that is to say a\r\ncorn-chest, 84 feeling sure that if they should return and come to a\r\nsearch, they were likely to examine everything: and this in fact\r\nhappened. So when they had come, and searching had failed to find it,\r\nthey thought it best to return and say to those who had sent them that\r\nthey had done all that which they had been charged by them to do. (e)\r\nThey then having departed said this; and after this the son of Aëtion\r\ngrew, and because he had escaped this danger, the name of Kypselos was\r\ngiven him as a surname derived from the corn-chest. Then when Kypselos\r\nhad grown to manhood and was seeking divination, a two-edged 85 answer\r\nwas given him at Delphi, placing trust in which he made an attempt upon\r\nCorinth and obtained possession of it. Now the answer was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"'Happy is this man's lot of a truth, who enters my dwelling,\r\n  Offspring of Aëtion, he shall rule in famous Corinthos,\r\n  Kypselos, he and his sons, but his children's children no longer.'\r\n\r\nSuch was the oracle: and Kypselos when he became despot was a man of\r\nthis character,--many of the Corinthians he drove into exile, many he\r\ndeprived of their wealth, and very many more of their lives. (f) And\r\nwhen he had reigned for thirty years and had brought his life to a\r\nprosperous end, his son Periander became his successor in the despotism.\r\nNow Periander at first was milder than his father; but after he had had\r\ndealings through messengers with Thrasybulos the despot of Miletos, he\r\nbecame far more murderous even than Kypselos. For he sent a messenger to\r\nThrasybulos and asked what settlement of affairs was the safest for him\r\nto make, in order that he might best govern his State: and Thrasybulos\r\nled forth the messenger who had come from Periander out of the city, and\r\nentered into a field of growing corn; and as he passed through the crop\r\nof corn, while inquiring and asking questions repeatedly 86 of the\r\nmessenger about the occasion of his coming from Corinth, he kept cutting\r\noff the heads of those ears of corn which he saw higher than the rest;\r\nand as he cut off their heads he cast them away, until he had destroyed\r\nin this manner the finest and richest part of the crop. So having passed\r\nthrough the place and having suggested no word of counsel, he dismissed\r\nthe messenger. When the messenger returned to Corinth, Periander was\r\nanxious to hear the counsel which had been given; but he said that\r\nThrasybulos had given him no counsel, and added that he wondered at the\r\ndeed of Periander in sending him to such a man, for the man was out of\r\nhis senses and a waster of his own goods,--relating at the same time\r\nthat which he had seen Thrasybulos do. (g) So Periander, understanding\r\nthat which had been done and perceiving that Thrasybulos counselled him\r\nto put to death those who were eminent among his subjects, began then to\r\ndisplay all manner of evil treatment to the citizens of the State; for\r\nwhatsoever Kypselos had left undone in killing and driving into exile,\r\nthis Periander completed. And in one day he stripped all the wives of\r\nthe Corinthians of their clothing on account of his own wife Melissa.\r\nFor when he had sent messengers to the Thesprotians on the river Acheron\r\nto ask the Oracle of the dead about a deposit made with him by a\r\nguest-friend, Melissa appeared and said she would not tell in what place\r\nthe deposit was laid, for she was cold and had no clothes, since those\r\nwhich he had buried with her were of no use to her, not having been\r\nburnt; and this, she said, would be an evidence to him that she was\r\nspeaking the truth, namely that when the oven was cold, Periander had\r\nput his loaves into it. When the report of this was brought back to\r\nPeriander, the token made him believe, because he had had commerce with\r\nMelissa after she was dead; and straightway after receiving the message\r\nhe caused proclamation to be made that all the wives of the Corinthians\r\nshould come out to the temple of Hera. They accordingly went as to a\r\nfestival in their fairest adornment; and he having set the spearmen of\r\nhis guard in ambush, stripped them all alike, both the free women and\r\ntheir attendant; and having gathered together all their clothes in a\r\nplace dug out, he set fire to them, praying at the same time to Melissa.\r\nThen after he had done this and had sent a second time, the apparition\r\nof Melissa told him in what spot he had laid the deposit entrusted to\r\nhim by his guest-friend.\r\n\r\n\"Such a thing, ye must know, Lacedemonians, is despotism, and such are\r\nits deeds: and we Corinthians marvelled much at first when we saw that\r\nye were sending for Hippias, and now we marvel even more because ye say\r\nthese things; and we adjure you, calling upon the gods of Hellas, not\r\nto establish despotisms in the cities. If however ye will not cease from\r\nyour design, but endeavour to restore Hippias contrary to that which is\r\njust, know that the Corinthians at least do not give their consent to\r\nthat which ye do.\"\r\n\r\n93. Socles being the envoy of Corinth thus spoke, and Hippias made\r\nanswer to him, calling to witness the same gods as he, that assuredly\r\nthe Corinthians would more than all others regret the loss of the sons\r\nof Peisistratos, when the appointed days should have come for them to\r\nbe troubled by the Athenians. Thus Hippias made answer, being acquainted\r\nwith the oracles more exactly than any other man: but the rest of the\r\nallies, who for a time had restrained themselves and kept silence, when\r\nthey heard Socles speak freely, gave utterance every one of them to\r\nthat which they felt, and adopted the opinion of the Corinthian envoy,\r\nadjuring the Lacedemonians not to do any violence to a city of Hellas.\r\n\r\n94. Thus was this brought to an end: and Hippias being dismissed from\r\nthence had Anthemus offered to him by Amyntas king of the Macedonians\r\nand Iolcos by the Thessalians. He however accepted neither of these, but\r\nretired again to Sigeion; which city Peisistratos had taken by force\r\nof arms from the Mytilenians, and having got possession of it, had\r\nappointed his own natural son Hegesistratos, born of an Argive woman, to\r\nbe despot of it: he however did not without a struggle keep possession\r\nof that which he received from Peisistratos; for the Mytilenians and\r\nAthenians carried on war for a long time, having their strongholds\r\nrespectively at Achilleion and at Sigeion, the one side demanding that\r\nthe place be restored to them, and the Athenians on the other hand not\r\nadmitting this demand, but proving by argument that the Aiolians had\r\nno better claim to the territory of Ilion than they and the rest of the\r\nHellenes, as many as joined with Menelaos in exacting vengeance for the\r\nrape of Helen.\r\n\r\n95. Now while these carried on the war, besides many other things of\r\nvarious kinds which occurred in the battles, once when a fight took\r\nplace and the Athenians were conquering, Alcaios the poet, taking to\r\nflight, escaped indeed himself, but the Athenians retained possession of\r\nhis arms and hung them up on the walls of the temple of Athene which\r\nis at Sigeion. About this matter Alcaios composed a song and sent it to\r\nMytilene, reporting therein his misadventure to one Melanippos, who was\r\nhis friend. Finally Periander the son of Kypselos made peace between the\r\nAthenians and the Mytilenians, 87 for to him they referred the matter\r\nas arbitrator; and he made peace between them on the condition that each\r\nshould continue to occupy that territory which they then possessed.\r\n\r\n96. Sigeion then in this matter had come under the rule of the\r\nAthenians. And when Hippias had returned to Asia from Lacedemon, he\r\nset everything in motion, stirring up enmity between the Athenians and\r\nArtaphrenes, and using every means to secure that Athens should come\r\nunder the rule of himself and of Dareios. Hippias, I say, was thus\r\nengaged; and the Athenians meanwhile hearing of these things sent envoys\r\nto Sardis, and endeavoured to prevent the Persians from following the\r\nsuggestions of the exiled Athenians. Artaphrenes however commanded\r\nthem, if they desired to be preserved from ruin, to receive Hippias back\r\nagain. This proposal the Athenians were not by any means disposed to\r\naccept when it was reported; and as they did not accept this, it became\r\nat once a commonly received opinion among them that they were enemies of\r\nthe Persians.\r\n\r\n97. While they had these thoughts and had been set at enmity with the\r\nPersians, at this very time Aristagoras the Milesian, ordered away from\r\nSparta by Cleomenes the Lacedemonian, arrived at Athens; for this\r\nwas the city which had most power of all the rest besides Sparta. And\r\nAristagoras came forward before the assembly of the people and said the\r\nsame things as he had said at Sparta about the wealth which there was in\r\nAsia, and about the Persian manner of making war, how they used neither\r\nshield nor spear and were easy to overcome. Thus I say he said, and\r\nalso he added this, namely that the Milesians were colonists from the\r\nAthenians, and that it was reasonable that the Athenians should rescue\r\nthem, since they had such great power; and there was nothing which he\r\ndid not promise, being very urgent in his request, until at last he\r\npersuaded them: for it would seem that it is easier to deceive many than\r\none, seeing that, though he did not prove able to deceive Cleomenes the\r\nLacedemonian by himself, yet he did this to thirty thousand Athenians.\r\nThe Athenians then, I say, being persuaded, voted a resolution to\r\ndespatch twenty ships to help the Ionians, and appointed to command them\r\nMelanthios one of their citizens, who was in all things highly reputed.\r\nThese ships proved to be the beginning of evils for the Hellenes and the\r\nBarbarians.\r\n\r\n98. Aristagoras however sailed on before and came to Miletos; and then\r\nhaving devised a plan from which no advantage was likely to come for the\r\nIonians (nor indeed was he doing what he did with a view to that, but\r\nin order to vex king Dareios), he sent a man to Phrygia to the Paionians\r\nwho had been taken captive by Megabazos from the river Strymon, and who\r\nwere dwelling in a district and village of Phrygia apart by themselves;\r\nand when the messenger came to the Paionians he spoke these words:\r\n\"Paionians, Aristagoras the despot of Miletos sent me to offer to you\r\nsalvation, if ye shall be willing to do as he says; for now all Ionia\r\nhas revolted from the king and ye have an opportunity of coming safe to\r\nyour own land: to reach the sea shall be your concern, and after this it\r\nshall be thenceforth ours.\" The Paionians hearing this received it as\r\na most welcome proposal, and taking with them their children and their\r\nwomen they began a flight to the sea; some of them however were struck\r\nwith fear and remained in the place where they were. Having come to the\r\ncoast the Paionians crossed over thence to Chios, and when they were\r\nalready in Chios there arrived in their track a large body of Persian\r\nhorsemen pursuing the Paionians. These, as they did not overtake them,\r\nsent over to Chios to bid the Paionians return back: the Paionians\r\nhowever did not accept their proposal, but the men of Chios conveyed\r\nthem from Chios to Lesbos, and the Lesbians brought them to Doriscos,\r\nand thence they proceeded by land and came to Paionia.\r\n\r\n99. Aristagoras meanwhile, when the Athenians had arrived with twenty\r\nships, bringing with them also five triremes of the Eretrians, joined\r\nthe expedition not for the sake of the Athenians but of the Milesians\r\nthemselves, to repay them a debt which they owed (for the Milesians in\r\nformer times had borne with the Eretrians the burden of all that war\r\nwhich they had with the Chalkidians at the time when the Chalkidians\r\non their side were helped by the Samians against the Eretrians and\r\nMilesians),--when these, I say, had arrived and the other allies were\r\non the spot, Aristagoras proceeded to make a march upon Sardis. On\r\nthis march he did not go himself, but remained at Miletos and appointed\r\nothers to be in command of the Milesians, namely his brother Charopinos\r\nand of the other citizens one Hermophantos. 8701\r\n\r\n100. With this force then the Ionians came to Ephesos, and leaving their\r\nships at Coresos in the land of Ephesos, went up themselves in a large\r\nbody, taking Ephesians to guide them in their march. So they marched\r\nalong by the river Caÿster, and then when they arrived after crossing\r\nthe range of Tmolos, they took Sardis without any resistance, all except\r\nthe citadel, but the citadel Artaphrenes himself saved from capture,\r\nhaving with him a considerable force of men.\r\n\r\n101. From plundering this city after they had taken it they were\r\nprevented by this:--the houses in Sardis were mostly built of reeds,\r\nand even those of them which were of brick had their roofs thatched with\r\nreeds: of these houses one was set on fire by a soldier, and forthwith\r\nthe fire going on from house to house began to spread over the whole\r\ntown. So then as the town was on fire, the Lydians and all the Persians\r\nwho were in the city being cut off from escape, since the fire was\r\nprevailing in the extremities round about them, and not having any way\r\nout of the town, flowed together to the market-place and to the river\r\nPactolos, which brings down gold-dust for them from Tmolos, flowing\r\nthrough the middle of their market-place, and then runs out into the\r\nriver Hermos, and this into the sea;--to this Pactolos, I say, and to\r\nthe market-place the Lydians and Persians gathered themselves together,\r\nand were compelled to defend themselves. The Ionians then, seeing some\r\nof the enemy standing on their defence and others in great numbers\r\ncoming on to the attack, were struck with fear and retired to the\r\nmountain called Tmolos, and after that at nightfall departed to go to\r\ntheir ships.\r\n\r\n102. Sardis was then destroyed by fire, and in it also the temple of the\r\nnative goddess Hybebe; which the Persians alleged afterwards as a reason\r\nfor setting on fire in return the temples in the land of the Hellenes.\r\nHowever at the time of which I speak the Persians who occupied districts\r\nwithin the river Halys, informed beforehand of this movement, were\r\ngathering together and coming to the help of the Lydians; and, as it\r\nchanced, they found when they came that the Ionians no longer were in\r\nSardis; but they followed closely in their track and came up with them\r\nat Ephesos: and the Ionians stood indeed against them in array, but\r\nwhen they joined battle they had very much the worse; and besides other\r\npersons of note whom the Persians slaughtered, there fell also Eualkides\r\ncommander of the Eretrians, a man who had won wreaths in contests of\r\nthe games and who was much celebrated by Simonides of Keos: and those of\r\nthem who survived the battle dispersed to their various cities.\r\n\r\n103. Thus then they fought at that time; and after the battle the\r\nAthenians left the Ionians together, and when Aristagoras was urgent\r\nin calling upon them by messengers for assistance, they said that\r\nthey would not help them: the Ionians, however, though deprived of the\r\nalliance of the Athenians, none the less continued to prepare for the\r\nwar with the king, so great had been the offences already committed by\r\nthem against Dareios. They sailed moreover to the Hellespont and brought\r\nunder their power Byzantion and all the other cities which are in those\r\nparts; and then having sailed forth out of the Hellespont, they gained\r\nin addition the most part of Caria to be in alliance with them: for even\r\nCaunos, which before was not willing to be their ally, then, after they\r\nhad burnt Sardis, was added to them also.\r\n\r\n104. The Cyprians too, excepting those of Amathus, were added\r\nvoluntarily to their alliance; for these also had revolted from the\r\nMedes in the following manner:--there was one Onesilos, younger brother\r\nof Gorgos king of Salamis, and son of Chersis, the son of Siromos, the\r\nson of Euelthon. This man in former times too had been wont often to\r\nadvise Gorgos to make revolt from the king, and at this time, when\r\nhe heard that the Ionians had revolted, he pressed him very hard and\r\nendeavoured to urge him to it. Since however he could not persuade\r\nGorgos, Onesilos watched for a time when he had gone forth out of the\r\ncity of Salamis, and then together with the men of his own faction he\r\nshut him out of the gates. Gorgos accordingly being robbed of the city\r\nwent for refuge to the Medes, and Onesilos was ruler of Salamis and\r\nendeavoured to persuade all the men of Cyprus to join him in revolt. The\r\nothers then he persuaded; but since those of Amathus were not willing to\r\ndo as he desired, he sat down before their city and besieged it.\r\n\r\n105. Onesilos then was besieging Amathus; and meanwhile, when it was\r\nreported to king Dareios that Sardis had been captured and burnt by the\r\nAthenians and the Ionians together, and that the leader of the league\r\nfor being about these things 88 was the Milesian Aristagoras, it is said\r\nthat at first being informed of this he made no account of the Ionians,\r\nbecause he knew that they at all events would not escape unpunished for\r\ntheir revolt, but he inquired into who the Athenians were; and when\r\nhe had been informed, he asked for his bow, and having received it\r\nand placed an arrow upon the string, he discharged it upwards towards\r\nheaven, and as he shot into the air he said: \"Zeus, that it may be\r\ngranted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians!\" Having so said he\r\ncharged one of his attendants, that when dinner was set before the king\r\nhe should say always three times: \"Master, remember the Athenians.\"\r\n\r\n106. When he had given this charge, he called into his presence\r\nHistiaios the Milesian, whom Dareios had now been keeping with him for a\r\nlong time, and said: \"I am informed, Histiaios, that thy deputy, to whom\r\nthou didst depute the government of Miletos, has made rebellion against\r\nme; for he brought in men against me from the other continent and\r\npersuaded the Ionians also,--who shall pay the penalty to me for that\r\nwhich they did,--these, I say, he persuaded to go together with them,\r\nand thus he robbed me of Sardis. Now therefore how thinkest thou that\r\nthis is well? and how without thy counsels was anything of this kind\r\ndone? Take heed lest thou afterwards find reason to blame thyself for\r\nthis.\" Histiaios replied: \"O king, what manner of speech is this that\r\nthou hast uttered, saying that I counselled a matter from which it was\r\nlikely that any vexation would grow for thee, either great or small?\r\nWhat have I to seek for in addition to that which I have, that I should\r\ndo these things; and of what am I in want? for I have everything that\r\nthou hast, and I am thought worthy by thee to hear all thy counsels.\r\nNay, but if my deputy is indeed acting in any such manner as thou\r\nhast said, be assured that he has done it merely on his own account. I\r\nhowever, for my part, do not even admit the report to be true, that the\r\nMilesians and my deputy are acting in any rebellious fashion against thy\r\npower: but if it prove that they are indeed doing anything of that kind,\r\nand if that which thou hast heard, O king, be the truth, learn then what\r\na thing thou didst in removing me away from the sea-coast; for it seems\r\nthat the Ionians, when I had gone out of the sight of their eyes, did\r\nthat which they had long had a desire to do; whereas if I had been in\r\nIonia, not a city would have made the least movement. Now therefore as\r\nquickly as possible let me set forth to go to Ionia, that I may order\r\nall these matters for thee as they were before, and deliver into thy\r\nhands this deputy of Miletos who contrived these things: and when I have\r\ndone this after thy mind, I swear by the gods of the royal house that I\r\nwill not put off from me the tunic which I wear when I go down to Ionia,\r\nuntil I have made Sardinia tributary to thee, which is the largest of\r\nall islands.\"\r\n\r\n107. Thus saying Histiaios endeavoured to deceive the king, and\r\nDareios was persuaded and let him go, charging him, when he should have\r\naccomplished that which he had promised, to return to him again at Susa.\r\n\r\n108. In the meantime, while the news about Sardis was going up to the\r\nking, and while Dareios, after doing that which he did with the bow,\r\ncame to speech with Histiaios, and Histiaios having been let go by\r\nDareios was making his journey to the sea-coast,--during all that time\r\nthe events were happening which here follow.--As Onesilos of Salamis\r\nwas besieging those of Amathus, it was reported to him that Artybios\r\na Persian, bringing with him in ships a large Persian army, was to be\r\nexpected shortly to arrive in Cyprus. Being informed of this, Onesilos\r\nsent heralds to different places in Ionia to summon the Ionians to his\r\nassistance; and they took counsel together and came without delay with a\r\nlarge force. Now the Ionians arrived in Cyprus just at the time when the\r\nPersians having crossed over in ships from Kilikia were proceeding by\r\nland to attack Salamis, while the Phenicians with the ships were sailing\r\nround the headland which is called the \"Keys of Cyprus.\"\r\n\r\n109. This being the case, the despots of Cyprus called together the\r\ncommanders of the Ionians and said: \"Ionians, we of Cyprus give you\r\na choice which enemy ye will rather fight with, the Persians or the\r\nPhenicians: for if ye will rather array yourselves on land and make\r\ntrial of the Persians in fight, it is time now for you to disembark from\r\nyour ships and array yourselves on the land, and for us to embark in\r\nyour ships to contend against the Phenicians; but if on the other hand\r\nye will rather make trial of the Phenicians,--whichever of these two ye\r\nshall choose, ye must endeavour that, so far as it rests with you, both\r\nIonia and Cyprus shall be free.\" To this the Ionians replied: \"We were\r\nsent out by the common authority of the Ionians to guard the sea, and\r\nnot to deliver our ships to the Cyprians and ourselves fight with the\r\nPersians on land. We therefore will endeavour to do good service in that\r\nplace to which we were appointed; and ye must call to mind all the evils\r\nwhich ye suffered from the Medes, when ye were in slavery to them, and\r\nprove yourselves good men.\"\r\n\r\n110. The Ionians made answer in these words; and afterwards, when the\r\nPersians had come to the plain of Salamis, the kings of the Cyprians set\r\nin order their array, choosing the best part of the troops of Salamis\r\nand of Soloi to be arrayed against the Persians and setting the other\r\nCyprians against the rest of the enemy's troops; and against Artybios,\r\nthe commander of the Persians, Onesilos took up his place in the array\r\nby his own free choice.\r\n\r\n111. Now Artybios was riding a horse which had been trained to rear\r\nup against a hoplite. Onesilos accordingly being informed of this, and\r\nhaving a shield-bearer, by race of Caria, who was of very good repute\r\nas a soldier and full of courage besides, 89 said to this man: \"I am\r\ninformed that the horse of Artybios rears upright and works both with\r\nhis feet and his mouth against any whom he is brought to attack. Do thou\r\ntherefore consider the matter, and tell me forthwith which of the two\r\nthou wilt rather watch for and strike, the horse or Artybios himself.\"\r\nTo this his attendant replied: \"O king, I am ready to do both or either\r\nof these two things, and in every case to do that which thou shalt\r\nappoint for me; but I will declare to thee the way in which I think it\r\nwill be most suitable 90 for thy condition. I say that it is right for\r\none who is king and commander to fight with a king and commander; for if\r\nthou shalt slay the commander of the enemy, it turns to great glory for\r\nthee; and again, if he shall slay thee, which heaven forbid, even death\r\nwhen it is at the hands of a worthy foe is but half to be lamented: but\r\nfor us who are under thy command it is suitable to fight with the others\r\nwho are under his command and with his horse: and of the tricks of the\r\nhorse have thou no fear at all, for I engage to thee that after this\r\nat least he shall never stand against any man more.\" Thus he spoke; and\r\nshortly afterwards the opposed forces joined battle both on land and\r\nwith their ships.\r\n\r\n112. On that day the Ionians for their part greatly distinguished\r\nthemselves and overcame the Phenicians, and of them the Samians were\r\nbest: and meanwhile on land, when the armies met, they came to close\r\nquarters and fought; and as regards the two commanders, what happened\r\nwas this:--when Artybios came to fight with Onesilos sitting upon his\r\nhorse, Onesilos, as he had concerted with his shield-bearer, struck at\r\nArtybios himself, when he came to fight with him; and when the horse put\r\nits hoofs against the shield of Onesilos, then the Carian struck with a\r\nfalchion 91 and smote off the horse's feet.\r\n\r\n113. So Artybios the commander of the Persians fell there on the spot\r\ntogether with his horse: and while the others also were fighting,\r\nStesenor the despot of Curion deserted them, having with him a\r\nlarge force of men,--now these Curians are said to be settlers\r\nfrom Argos,--and when the Curians had deserted, forthwith also the\r\nwar-chariots of the men of Salamis proceeded to do the same as the\r\nCurians. When these things took place, the Persians had the advantage\r\nover the Cyprians; and after their army had been put to rout, many\r\nothers fell and among them Onesilos the son of Chersis, he who brought\r\nabout the revolt of the Cyprians, and also the king of the Solians,\r\nAristokypros the son of Philokypros,--that Philokypros whom Solon the\r\nAthenian, when he came to Cyprus, commended in verse above all other\r\ndespots.\r\n\r\n114. So the men of Amathus cut off the head of Onesilos, because he had\r\nbesieged them; and having brought it to Amathus they hung it over the\r\ngate of the city: and as the head hung there, when it had now become a\r\nhollow, a swarm of bees entered into it and filled it with honeycomb.\r\nThis having so come to pass, the Amathusians consulted an Oracle about\r\nthe head, and they received an answer bidding them take it down and bury\r\nit and sacrifice to Onesilos every year as a hero; and if they did this,\r\nit would go better with them.\r\n\r\n115. The Amathusians accordingly continued to do so even to my time. But\r\nthe Ionians who had fought the sea-fight in Cyprus, when they perceived\r\nthat the fortunes of Onesilos were ruined and that the cities of the\r\nCyprians were besieged, except Salamis, and that this city had been\r\ndelivered over by the Salaminians to Gorgos the former king,--as soon as\r\nthey perceived this, the Ionians sailed away back to Ionia. Now of the\r\ncities in Cyprus Soloi held out for the longest time under the siege;\r\nand the Persians took it in the fifth month by undermining the wall\r\nround.\r\n\r\n116. The Cyprians then, after they had made themselves free for one\r\nyear, had again been reduced to slavery afresh: and meanwhile Daurises,\r\nwho was married to a daughter of Dareios, and Hymaies and Otanes, who\r\nwere also Persian commanders and were married also to daughters\r\nof Dareios, after they had pursued those Ionians who had made the\r\nexpedition to Sardis and defeating them in battle had driven them\r\nby force to their ships,--after this distributed the cities amongst\r\nthemselves and proceeded to sack them.\r\n\r\n117. Daurises directed his march to the cities on the Hellespont, and he\r\ntook Dardanos and Abydos and Percote and Lampsacos and Paisos, of these\r\nhe took on each day one; and as he was marching from Paisos against the\r\ncity of Parion, the report came that the Carians had made common cause\r\nwith the Ionians and were in revolt from the Persians. He turned back\r\ntherefore from the Hellespont and marched his army upon Caria. 118.\r\nAnd, as it chanced, a report of this was brought to the Carians before\r\nDaurises arrived; and the Carians being informed of it gathered together\r\nat the place which is called the \"White Pillars\" and at the river\r\nMarsyas, which flows from the region of Idrias and runs out into the\r\nMaiander. When the Carians had been gathered together there, among many\r\nother counsels which were given, the best, as it seems to me, was that\r\nof Pixodaros the son of Mausolos, a man of Kindye, who was married to\r\nthe daughter of the king of the Kilikians, Syennesis. The opinion\r\nof this man was to the effect that the Carians should cross over the\r\nMaiander and engage battle with the Persians having the river at their\r\nbacks, in order that the Carians, not being able to fly backwards and\r\nbeing compelled to remain where they were, might prove themselves even\r\nbetter men in fight than they naturally would. This opinion did not\r\nprevail; but they resolved that the Persians rather than themselves\r\nshould have the Maiander at their backs, evidently 92 in order that if\r\nthere should be a flight of the Persians and they should be worsted in\r\nthe battle, they might never return home, but might fall into the river.\r\n\r\n119. After this, when the Persians had come and had crossed the\r\nMaiander, the Carians engaged with the Persians on the river Marsyas and\r\nfought a battle which was obstinately contested and lasted long; but at\r\nlength they were worsted by superior numbers: and of the Persians there\r\nfell as many as two thousand, but of the Carians ten thousand. Then\r\nthose of them who escaped were shut up in Labraunda 93 within\r\nthe sanctuary of Zeus Stratios, which is a large sacred grove of\r\nplane-trees; now the Carians are the only men we know who offer\r\nsacrifices to Zeus Stratios. These men then, being shut up there, were\r\ntaking counsel together about their safety, whether they would fare\r\nbetter if they delivered themselves over to the Persians or if they left\r\nAsia altogether.\r\n\r\n120. And while they were thus taking counsel, there came to their aid\r\nthe Milesians and their allies. Then the Carians dismissed the plans\r\nwhich they were before considering and prepared to renew the war again\r\nfrom the beginning: and when the Persians came to attack them, they\r\nengaged with them and fought a battle, and they were worsted yet more\r\ncompletely than before; and while many were slain of all parties, 94 the\r\nMilesians suffered most.\r\n\r\n121. Then afterwards the Carians repaired this loss and retrieved their\r\ndefeat; for being informed that the Persians had set forth to march upon\r\ntheir cities, they laid an ambush on the road which is by Pedasos, 95\r\nand the Persians falling into it by night were destroyed both they and\r\ntheir commanders, namely Daurises and Amorges and Sisimakes; and with\r\nthem died also Myrsos the son of Gyges. Of this ambush the leader was\r\nHeracleides the son of Ibanollis, a man of Mylasa.\r\n\r\n122. These then of the Persians were thus destroyed; and meanwhile\r\nHymaies, who was another of those who pursued after the Ionians that had\r\nmade the expedition to Sardis, directed his march to the Propontis and\r\ntook Kios in Mysia; and having conquered this city, when he was informed\r\nthat Daurises had left the Hellespont and was marching towards Caria, he\r\nleft the Propontis and led his army to the Hellespont: and he conquered\r\nall the Aiolians who occupy the district of Ilion, and also the\r\nGergithes, who were left behind as a remnant of the ancient Teucrians.\r\nWhile conquering these tribes Hymaies himself ended his life by sickness\r\nin the land of Troas.\r\n\r\n123. He thus brought his life to an end; and Artaphrenes the governor\r\nof the province of Sardis was appointed with Otanes the third of the\r\ncommanders to make the expedition against Ionia and that part of Aiolia\r\nwhich bordered upon it. Of Ionia these took the city of Clazomenai, and\r\nof the Aiolians Kyme.\r\n\r\n124. While the cities were thus being taken, Aristagoras the Milesian,\r\nbeing, as he proved in this instance, not of very distinguished courage,\r\nsince after having disturbed Ionia and made preparation of great matters\r\n96 he counselled running away when he saw these things, (moreover it\r\nhad become clear to him that it was impossible to overcome king\r\nDareios),--he, I say, having regard to these things, called together\r\nthose of his own party and took counsel with them, saying that it was\r\nbetter that there should be a refuge prepared for them, in case that\r\nthey should after all be driven out from Miletos, and proposing the\r\nquestion whether he should lead them from thence to Sardinia, to form\r\na colony there, or to Myrkinos in the land of the Edonians, which\r\nHistiaios had been fortifying, having received it as a gift from\r\nDareios. This was the question proposed by Aristagoras.\r\n\r\n125. Now the opinion of Hecataios the son of Hegesander the historian\r\n97 was that he should not take a colony to either of these places, but\r\nbuild a wall of defence for himself in the island of Leros and keep\r\nstill, if he should be forced to leave Miletos; and afterwards with this\r\nfor his starting point he would be able to return to Miletos.\r\n\r\n126. This was the counsel of Hecataios; but Aristagoras was most\r\ninclined to go forth to Myrkinos. He therefore entrusted the government\r\nof Miletos to Pythagoras, a man of repute among the citizens, and he\r\nhimself sailed away to Thrace, taking with him every one who desired to\r\ngo; and he took possession of the region for which he had set out.\r\nBut starting from this to make war, he perished by the hands of the\r\nThracians, that is both Aristagoras himself and his army, when he was\r\nencamped about a certain city and the Thracians desired to go out from\r\nit under a truce.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO BOOK V\r\n\r\n1 [ {ie paion} (or {paian}), as the burden of a song of triumph.]\r\n\r\n2 [ {eggenetai}: many MSS. and some Editors read {en genetai}, \"and the\r\nrace can never become united.\"]\r\n\r\n3 [ iv. 93.]\r\n\r\n301 [ Or \"from the time that he was born.\"]\r\n\r\n4 [ {to astikton} is probably for {to me estikhthai}: but possibly the\r\nmeaning may be, \"those who are not so marked are of low birth.\"]\r\n\r\n5 [ \"the greatest prizes are assigned for single combat in proportion\"\r\n(as it is more difficult).]\r\n\r\n6 [ Or \"Siriopaionians.\"]\r\n\r\n7 [ The words \"and about the Doberians and Agrianians and Odomantians\"\r\nare marked by Stein as an interpolation, on the ground that the two\r\ntribes first mentioned are themselves Paionian; but Doberians are\r\ndistinguished from Paionians in vii. 113.]\r\n\r\n8 [ {theres katarraktes}: the MSS. have {thures katapaktes} (which can\r\nhardly be right, since the Ionic form would be {katapektes}), meaning\r\n\"fastened down.\" Stein suggests {thures katepaktes} (from {katepago}),\r\nwhich might mean \"a door closed downwards,\" but the word is not found.\r\n(The Medicean MS. has {e} written over the last {a} of {katapaktes}.)]\r\n\r\n9 [ {diapinontes}: or perhaps, \"drinking against one another.\"]\r\n\r\n10 [ See viii. 137.]\r\n\r\n11 [ i.e. \"he was drawn to run in the first pair.\"]\r\n\r\n12 [ The best MSS. give this form throughout, which is also used by\r\nÆschylus: cp. iii. 70, note 60.]\r\n\r\n13 [ {ekakothesan}.]\r\n\r\n14 [ {toutou}: it is doubtful whether this means his power or his death.\r\nPerhaps something has dropped out after {teleuta}.]\r\n\r\n15 [ {anesis}: a conjectural emendation of {aneos}.

THE SIXTH BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED ERATO\r\n\r\n1. Aristagoras accordingly, after having caused Ionia to revolt, thus\r\nbrought his life to an end; and meanwhile Histiaios the despot of\r\nMiletos, having been let go by Dareios had arrived at Sardis: and when\r\nhe came from Susa, Artaphrenes the governor of Sardis asked him for what\r\nreason he supposed the Ionians had revolted; and he said that he could\r\nnot tell, and moreover he expressed wonder at that which had happened,\r\npretending that he knew nothing of the state of affairs. Then\r\nArtaphrenes seeing that he was using dissimulation said, having\r\nknowledge of the truth about the revolt: \"Thus it is with thee,\r\nHistiaios, about these matters,--this shoe was stitched by thee, and put\r\non by Aristagoras.\".\r\n\r\n2. Thus said Artaphrenes with reference to the revolt; and Histiaios\r\nfearing Artaphrenes because he understood the matter, ran away the\r\nnext night at nightfall and went to the sea-coast, having deceived king\r\nDareios, seeing that he had engaged to subdue Sardinia the largest of\r\nislands, and instead of that he was endeavouring to take upon himself\r\nleadership of the Ionians in the war against Dareios. Then having\r\ncrossed over to Chios he was put in bonds by the Chians, being accused\r\nby them of working for a change of their State by suggestion of Dareios.\r\nWhen however the Chians learnt the whole story and heard that he was an\r\nenemy to the king, they released him..\r\n\r\n3. Then Histiaios, being asked by the Ionians for what reason he had so\r\nurgently charged Aristagoras to revolt from the king and had wrought so\r\ngreat an evil for the Ionians, did not by any means declare to them\r\nthat which had been in truth the cause, but reported to them that king\r\nDareios had resolved to remove the Phenicians from their land and to\r\nsettle them in Ionia, and the Ionians in Phenicia; and for this reason,\r\nhe said, he had given the charge. Thus he attempted to alarm the\r\nIonians, although the king had never resolved to do so at all.\r\n\r\n4. After this Histiaios acting through a messenger, namely Hermippos\r\na man of Atarneus, sent papers to the Persians who were at Sardis,\r\nimplying that he had already talked matters over with them about a\r\nrevolt: and Hermippos did not deliver them to those to whom he was sent,\r\nbut bore the papers and put them into the hands of Artaphrenes. He then,\r\nperceiving all that was being done, bade Hermippos bear the papers sent\r\nby Histiaios and deliver them to those to whom he was sent to bear\r\nthem, and to deliver to him the replies sent back by the Persians to\r\nHistiaios. These things having been discovered, Artaphrenes upon that\r\nput to death many of the Persians.\r\n\r\n5. As regards Sardis therefore there was confusion of the design; and\r\nwhen Histiaios had been disappointed of this hope, the Chians attempted\r\nto restore him to Miletos at the request of Histiaios himself.\r\nThe Milesians, however, who had been rejoiced before to be rid of\r\nAristagoras, were by no means eager to receive another despot into their\r\nland, seeing that they had tasted of liberty: and in fact Histiaios,\r\nattempting to return to Miletos by force and under cover of night, was\r\nwounded in the thigh by one of the Milesians. He then, being repulsed\r\nfrom his own city, returned to Chios; and thence, as he could not\r\npersuade the Chians to give him ships, he crossed over to Mytilene and\r\nendeavoured to persuade the Lesbians to give him ships. So they manned\r\neight triremes and sailed with Histiaios to Byzantion, and stationing\r\nthemselves there they captured the ships which sailed out of the Pontus,\r\nexcepting where the crews of them said that they were ready to do the\r\nbidding of Histiaios.\r\n\r\n6. While Histiaios and the men of Mytilene were acting thus, a large\r\narmy both of sea and land forces was threatening to attack Miletos\r\nitself; for the commanders of the Persians had joined together to form\r\none single army and were marching upon Miletos, considering the other\r\ntowns of less account. Of their naval force the most zealous were the\r\nPhenicians, and with them also served the Cyprians, who had just been\r\nsubdued, and the Kilikians and Egyptians..\r\n\r\n7. These, I say, were advancing upon Miletos and the rest of Ionia; and\r\nmeanwhile the Ionians being informed of this were sending deputies 1\r\nchosen from themselves to the Panionion. 2 When these had arrived at\r\nthat place and took counsel together, they resolved not to gather a\r\nland-army to oppose the Persians, but that the Milesians should defend\r\ntheir walls by themselves, and that the Ionians should man their fleet,\r\nleaving out not one of their ships, and having done so should assemble\r\nas soon as possible at Lade, to fight a sea-battle in defence of\r\nMiletos. Now Lade is a small island lying opposite the city of the\r\nMilesians..\r\n\r\n8. Then the Ionians manned their ships and came thither, and with them\r\nalso those Aiolians who inhabit Lesbos; and they were drawn up in\r\norder thus:--the extremity of the line towards the East was held by the\r\nMilesians themselves, who furnished eighty ships; next to them were\r\nthe Prienians with twelve ships and the men of Myus with three; next to\r\nthose of Myus were the Teians with seventeen ships, and after the\r\nTeians the Chians with a hundred; after these were stationed the men\r\nof Erythrai and of Phocaia, the former furnishing eight ships and the\r\nlatter three; next to the Phocaians were the Lesbians with seventy\r\nships, and last, holding the extremity of the line towards the West,\r\nwere stationed the Samians with sixty ships. Of all these the total\r\nnumber proved to be three hundred and fifty-three triremes..\r\n\r\n9. These were the ships of the Ionians; and of the Barbarians the number\r\nof ships was six hundred. When these too were come to the Milesian coast\r\nand their whole land-army was also there, then the commanders of the\r\nPersians, being informed of the number of the Ionian ships, were struck\r\nwith fear lest they should be unable to overcome them, and thus on the\r\none hand should not be able to conquer Miletos from not having command\r\nof the sea, and at the same time should run a risk of being punished by\r\nDareios. Reflecting upon these things they gathered together the despots\r\nof the Ionians who were exiles with the Medes, having been deposed from\r\ntheir governments by Aristagoras the Milesian, and who chanced to be\r\nthen joining in the expedition against Miletos,--of these men they\r\ncalled together those who were present and spoke to them as follows:\r\n\"Ionians, now let each one of you show himself a benefactor of the\r\nking's house, that is to say, let each one of you endeavour to detach\r\nhis own countrymen from the body of the alliance: and make your\r\nproposals promising at the same time that they shall suffer nothing\r\nunpleasant on account of the revolt, and neither their temples nor their\r\nprivate houses shall be burnt, nor shall they have any worse treatment\r\nthan they had before this; but if they will not do so, but will by all\r\nmeans enter into a contest with us, threaten them and tell them this,\r\nwhich in truth shall happen to them, namely that if they are worsted in\r\nthe fight they shall be reduced to slavery, and we shall make their sons\r\neunuchs, and their maidens we shall remove to Bactria, and deliver their\r\nland to others.\".\r\n\r\n10. They thus spoke; and the despots of Ionia sent each one by night\r\nto his own people announcing to them this. The Ionians however, that\r\nis those to whom these messages came, continued obstinate and would not\r\naccept the thought of treason to their cause; and each people thought\r\nthat to them alone the Persians were sending this message.\r\n\r\n11. This happened as soon as the Persians came to Miletos; and after\r\nthis the Ionians being gathered together at Lade held meetings; and\r\nothers no doubt also made speeches to them, but especially the Phocaian\r\ncommander Dionysios, who said as follows: \"Seeing that our affairs are\r\nset upon the razor's edge, Ionians, whether we shall be free or slaves,\r\nand slaves too to be dealt with as runaways, now therefore if ye shall\r\nbe willing to take upon yourselves hardships, ye will have labour for\r\nthe time being, but ye will be able to overcome the enemy and be free;\r\nwhereas if ye continue to be self-indulgent and without discipline, I\r\nhave no hope for you that ye will not pay the penalty to the king for\r\nyour revolt. Nay, but do as I say, and deliver yourselves over to me;\r\nand I engage, if the gods grant equal conditions, that either the\r\nenemy will not fight with us, or that fighting he shall be greatly\r\ndiscomfited.\".\r\n\r\n12. Hearing this the Ionians delivered themselves to Dionysios; and he\r\nused to bring the ships out every day in single file, 3 that he might\r\npractise the rowers by making the ships break through one another's\r\nline, 4 and that he might get the fighting-men in the ships under arms;\r\nan then for the rest of the day he would keep the ships at anchor; and\r\nthus he gave the Ionians work to do during the whole day. For seven\r\ndays then they submitted and did that which he commanded; but on the\r\nday after these the Ionians, being unaccustomed to such toils and\r\nbeing exhausted with hard work and hot sun, spoke to one another thus:\r\n\"Against which of the deities have we offended, that we thus fill up the\r\nmeasure of evil? for surely we have delivered ourselves to a Phocaian,\r\nan impostor, who furnishes but three ships: and he has taken us into\r\nhis hands and maltreats us with evil dealing from which we can never\r\nrecover; and many of us in fact have fallen into sicknesses, and many\r\nothers, it may be expected, will suffer the same thing shortly; and for\r\nus it is better to endure anything else in the world rather than these\r\nills, and to undergo the slavery which will come upon us, whatever that\r\nshall be, rather than to be oppressed by that which we have now. Come,\r\nlet us not obey him after this any more.\" So they said, and forthwith\r\nafter this every one refused to obey him, and they pitched their tents\r\nin the island like an army, and kept in the shade, and would not go on\r\nboard their ships or practise any exercises.\r\n\r\n13. Perceiving this which was being done by the Ionians, the commanders\r\nof the Samians then at length accepted from Aiakes the son of Syloson\r\nthose proposals which Aiakes sent before at the bidding of the Persians,\r\nasking them to leave the alliance of the Ionians; the Samians, I say,\r\naccepted these proposals, perceiving that there was great want of\r\ndiscipline on the part of the Ionians, while at the same time it was\r\nclear to them that it was impossible to overcome the power of the king;\r\nand they well knew also that even if they should overcome the present\r\nnaval force of Dareios, 5 another would be upon them five times as\r\nlarge. Having found an occasion 6 then, so soon as they saw that the\r\nIonians refused to be serviceable, they counted it gain for themselves\r\nto save their temples and their private property. Now Aiakes, from whom\r\nthe Samians accepted the proposals, was the son of Syloson, the son of\r\nAiakes, and being despot of Samos he had been deprived of his rule by\r\nAristagoras the Milesian, like the other despots of Ionia..\r\n\r\n14. So when the Phenicians sailed to the attack, the Ionians also put\r\nout their ships from shore against them, sailing in single file: and\r\nwhen they came near and engaged battle with one another, as regards what\r\nfollowed I am not able exactly to record which of the Ionians showed\r\nthemselves cowards or good men in this sea-fight, for they throw blame\r\nupon one another. The Samians however, it is said, according to their\r\nagreement with Aiakes put up their sails then and set forth from their\r\nplace in the line to sail back to Samos, excepting only eleven ships:\r\nof these the captains stayed in their places and took part in the\r\nsea-fight, refusing to obey the commanders of their division; and the\r\npublic authority of the Samians granted them on account of this to have\r\ntheir names written up on a pillar with their fathers' names also, 601\r\nas having proved themselves good men; and this pillar exists still in\r\nthe market-place. Then the Lesbians also, when they saw that those next\r\nthem in order were taking to flight, did the same things as the Samians\r\nhad done, and so also most of the Ionians did the very same thing..\r\n\r\n15. Of those which remained in their places in the sea-fight the Chians\r\nsuffered very severely, 7 since they displayed brilliant deeds of valour\r\nand refused to play the coward. These furnished, as was before said,\r\na hundred ships and in each of them forty picked men of their citizens\r\nserved as fighting-men; 8 and when they saw the greater number of their\r\nallies deserting them, they did not think fit to behave like the\r\ncowards among them, but left along with a few only of their allies they\r\ncontinued to fight and kept breaking through the enemy's line; until at\r\nlast, after they had conquered many ships of the enemy, they lost the\r\ngreater number of their own..\r\n\r\n16. The Chians then with the remainder of their ships fled away to\r\ntheir own land; but those of the Chians whose ships were disabled by the\r\ndamage which they had received, being pursued fled for refuge to Mycale;\r\nand their ships they ran ashore there and left them behind, while the\r\nmen proceeded over the mainland on foot: and when the Chians had entered\r\nthe Ephesian territory on their way, then since 801 they came into it by\r\nnight and at a time when a festival of Thesmophoria was being celebrated\r\nby the women of the place, the Ephesians, not having heard beforehand\r\nhow it was with the Chians and seeing that an armed body had entered\r\ntheir land, supposed certainly that they were robbers and had a design\r\nupon the women; so they came out to the rescue in a body and slew the\r\nChians.\r\n\r\n17. Such was the fortune which befell these men: but Dionysios the\r\nPhocaian, when he perceived that the cause of the Ionians was ruined,\r\nafter having taken three ships of the enemy sailed away, not to Phocaia\r\nany more, for he knew well that it would be reduced to slavery together\r\nwith the rest of Ionia, and he sailed forthwith straight to Phenicia;\r\nand having there sunk merchant ships and taken a great quantity of\r\ngoods, he sailed thence to Sicily. Then with that for his starting-point\r\nhe became a freebooter, not plundering any Hellenes, but Carthaginians\r\nand Tyrsenians only.\r\n\r\n18. The Persians, then, being conquerors of the Ionians in the\r\nsea-fight, besieged Miletos by land and sea, undermining the walls and\r\nbringing against it all manner of engines; and they took it completely 9\r\nin the sixth year from the revolt of Aristagoras, and reduced the people\r\nto slavery; so that the disaster agreed with the oracle which had been\r\nuttered with reference to Miletos..\r\n\r\n19. For when the Argives were inquiring at Delphi about the safety of\r\ntheir city, there was given to them an oracle which applied to both,\r\nthat is to say, part of it had reference to the Argives themselves,\r\nwhile that which was added afterwards referred to the Milesians. The\r\npart of it which had reference to the Argives I will record when I reach\r\nthat place in the history, 10 but that which the Oracle uttered with\r\nreference to the Milesians, who were not there present, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"And at that time, O Miletos, of evil deeds the contriver,\r\n  Thou shalt be made for many a glorious gift and a banquet:\r\n  Then shall thy wives be compelled to wash the feet of the long-haired,\r\n  And in Didyma then my shrine shall be tended by others.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I speak these things came upon the Milesians, since\r\nmost of the men were killed by the Persians, who are long-haired, and\r\nthe women and children were dealt with as slaves; and the temple at\r\nDidyma, with the sacred building and the sanctuary of the Oracle, was\r\nfirst plundered and then burnt. Of the things in this temple I have made\r\nmention frequently in other parts of the history. 11.\r\n\r\n20. After this the Milesians who had been taken prisoner were conducted\r\nto Susa; and king Dareios did to them no other evil, but settled them\r\nupon the Sea called Erythraian, in the city of Ampe, by which the Tigris\r\nflows when it runs out into the sea. Of the Milesian land the Persians\r\nthemselves kept the surroundings of the city and the plain, but the\r\nheights they gave to the Carians of Pedasa for a possession.\r\n\r\n21. When the Milesians suffered this treatment from the Persians, the\r\nmen of Sybaris, who were dwelling in Laos and Skidros, being deprived of\r\ntheir own city, did not repay like with like: for when Sybaris was taken\r\nby the men of Croton, the Milesians all from youth upwards shaved their\r\nheads and put on great mourning: for these cities were more than all\r\nothers of which we know bound together by ties of friendship. Not like\r\nthe Sybarites were the Athenians; for these made it clear that they were\r\ngrieved at the capture of Miletos, both in many other ways and also by\r\nthis, that when Phrynichos had composed a drama called the \"Capture of\r\nMiletos\" and had put it on the stage, the body of spectators fell to\r\nweeping, and the Athenians moreover fined the poet a thousand drachmas\r\non the ground that he had reminded them of their own calamities; and\r\nthey ordered also that no one in future should represent this drama.\r\n\r\n22. Miletos then had been stripped bare of its former inhabitants: but\r\nof the Samians they who had substance were by no means satisfied with\r\nthat which had been concerted by the commanders of their fleet with the\r\nMedes; and taking counsel forthwith after the sea-fight it seemed good\r\nto them, before their despot Aiakes arrived in the country, to sail away\r\nand make a colony, and not to stay behind and be slaves of the Medes\r\nand of Aiakes: for just at this time the people of Zancle in Sicily\r\nwere sending messengers to Ionia and inviting the Ionians to come to the\r\n\"Fair Strand,\" 1101 desiring there to found a city of Ionians. Now this\r\nwhich is called the Fair Strand is in the land of the Sikelians and on\r\nthat side of Sicily which lies towards Tyrsenia. So when these gave the\r\ninvitation, the Samians alone of all the Ionians set forth, having with\r\nthem those of the Milesians who had escaped: and in the course of this\r\nmatter it happened as follows:--\r\n\r\n23. The Samians as they made their way towards Sicily reached Locroi\r\nEpizephyroi, and at the same time the people of Zancle, both themselves\r\nand their king, whose name was Skythes, were encamped about a city\r\nof the Sikelians, desiring to conquer it. Perceiving these things,\r\nAnaxilaos the despot of Rhegion, being then at variance with those of\r\nZancle, communicated with the Samians and persuaded them that they ought\r\nto leave the Fair Strand alone, to which they were sailing, and take\r\npossession of Zancle instead, since it was left now without men to\r\ndefend it. The Samians accordingly did as he said and took possession of\r\nZancle; and upon this the men of Zancle, being informed that their city\r\nwas possessed by an enemy, set out to rescue it, and invited Hippocrates\r\nthe despot of Gela to help them, for he was their ally. When however\r\nHippocrates also with his army had come up to their rescue, first he put\r\nSkythes the ruler of the Zanclaians in fetters, on the ground that he\r\nhad been the cause of the city being lost, and together with him his\r\nbrother Pythogenes, and sent them away to the town of Incyos; 12 then he\r\nbetrayed the cause of the remaining Zanclaians by coming to terms with\r\nthe Samians and exchanging oaths with them; and in return for this it\r\nhad been promised by the Samians that Hippocrates should receive as his\r\nshare the half of all the movable goods in the city and of the slaves,\r\nand the whole of the property in the fields round. So the greater number\r\nof the Zanclaians he put in bonds and kept himself as slaves, but the\r\nchief men of them, three hundred in number, he gave to the Samians to\r\nput to death; which however the Samians did not do.\r\n\r\n24. Now Skythes the ruler of the Zanclaians escaped from Incyos to\r\nHimera, and thence he came to Asia and went up to the court of Dareios:\r\nand Dareios accounted him the most righteous of all the men who had come\r\nup to him from Hellas; for he obtained leave of the king and went away\r\nto Sicily, and again came back from Sicily to the king; and at last he\r\nbrought his life to an end among the Persians in old age and possessing\r\ngreat wealth. The Samians then, having got rid of the rule of the Medes,\r\nhad gained for themselves without labour the fair city of Zancle.\r\n\r\n25. After the sea-battle which was fought for Miletos, the Phenicians by\r\nthe command of the Persians restored to Samos Aiakes the son of Syloson,\r\nsince he had been to them of much service and had done for them great\r\nthings; and the Samians alone of all who revolted from Dareios, because\r\nof the desertion of their ships which were in the sea-fight, 13 had\r\nneither their city nor their temples burnt. Then after the capture of\r\nMiletos the Persians forthwith got possession of Caria, some of the\r\ncities having submitted to their power voluntarily, while others of them\r\nthey brought over by force.\r\n\r\n26. Thus it came to pass as regards these matters: and meanwhile\r\nHistiaios the Milesian, who was at Byzantion and was seizing the\r\nmerchant vessels of the Ionians as they sailed forth out of the Pontus,\r\nreceived the report of that which had happened about Miletos. Upon that\r\nhe entrusted the matters which had to do with the Hellespont to Bisaltes\r\nthe son of Apollophanes, a man of Abydos, while he himself with the\r\nLesbians sailed to Chios; and when a body of the Chians who were on\r\nguard did not allow him to approach, he fought with them at that spot in\r\nthe Chian land which is called the \"Hollows.\" 14 Histiaios then not only\r\nslew many of these, but also, taking Polichne of the Chians as his base,\r\nhe conquered with the help of the Lesbians the remainder of the Chians\r\nas well, since they had suffered great loss by the sea-fight..\r\n\r\n27. And heaven is wont perhaps to give signs beforehand whenever great\r\nevils are about to happen to a city or a race of men; for to the Chians\r\nalso before these events remarkable signs had come. In the first place\r\nwhen they had sent to Delphi a chorus of a hundred youths, two only\r\nreturned home, the remaining ninety-eight of them having been seized by\r\na plague and carried off; and then secondly in their city about the same\r\ntime, that is shortly before the sea-fight, as some children were being\r\ntaught 15 in school the roof fell in upon them, so that of a hundred\r\nand twenty children only one escaped. These signs God showed to them\r\nbeforehand; and after this the sea-fight came upon them and brought\r\ntheir State down upon its knees; and as the Chians had suffered great\r\nloss, he without difficulty effected the conquest of them.\r\n\r\n28. Thence Histiaios made an expedition against Thasos, taking with him\r\na large force of Ionians and Aiolians; and while he was encamped about\r\nthe town of Thasos, a report came to him that the Phenicians were\r\nsailing up from Miletos to conquer the rest of Ionia. Being informed of\r\nthis he left Thasos unconquered and himself hastened to Lesbos, taking\r\nwith him his whole army. Then, as his army was in want of food, 16 he\r\ncrossed over from Lesbos to reap the corn in Atarneus and also that in\r\nthe plain of the Caïcos, which belonged to the Mysians. In these parts\r\nthere chanced to be a Persian named Harpagos commanding a considerable\r\nforce; and this man fought a battle with him after he had landed, and\r\nhe took Histiaios himself prisoner and destroyed the greater part of his\r\narmy..\r\n\r\n29. And Histiaios was taken prisoner in the following manner:--As the\r\nHellenes were fighting with the Persians at Malene in the district of\r\nAtarneus, after they had been engaged in close combat for a long time,\r\nthe cavalry at length charged and fell upon the Hellenes; and the\r\ncavalry in fact decided the battle. 17 So when the Hellenes had been\r\nturned to flight, Histiaios trusting that he would not be put to death\r\nby the king on account of his present fault, conceived a love of life,\r\nso that when he was being caught in his flight by a Persian and was\r\nabout to be run through by him in the moment of his capture, he spoke\r\nin Persian and made himself known, saying that he was Histiaios the\r\nMilesian..\r\n\r\n30. If then upon being taken prisoner he had been brought to king\r\nDareios, he would not, as I think, have suffered any harm, but Dareios\r\nwould have forgiven the crime with which he was charged; as it was,\r\nhowever, for this very reason and in order that he might not escape\r\nfrom punishment and again become powerful with the king, Artaphrenes\r\nthe governor of Sardis and Harpagos who had captured him, when he had\r\nreached Sardis on his way to the king, put him to death there and then,\r\nand his body they impaled, but embalmed his head and brought it up to\r\nDareios at Susa. Dareios having been informed of this, found fault\r\nwith those who had done so, because they had not brought him up to his\r\npresence alive; and he bade wash the head of Histiaios and bestow upon\r\nit proper care, and then bury it, as that of one who had been greatly a\r\nbenefactor both of the king himself and of the Persians.\r\n\r\n31. Thus it happened about Histiaios; and meanwhile the Persian fleet,\r\nafter wintering near Miletos, when it put to sea again in the following\r\nyear conquered without difficulty the islands lying near the mainland,\r\nChios, Lesbos, and Tenedos; and whenever they took one of the islands,\r\nthe Barbarians, as each was conquered, swept the inhabitants off it; 18\r\nand this they do in the following manner:--they extend themselves from\r\nthe sea on the North to the sea on the South, each man having hold\r\nof the hand of the next, and then they pass through the whole island\r\nhunting the people out of it. They took also the Ionian cities on the\r\nmainland in the same manner, except that they did not sweep off the\r\ninhabitants thus, for it was not possible..\r\n\r\n32. Then the commanders of the Persians proved not false to the threats\r\nwith which they had threatened the Ionians when these were encamped\r\nopposite to them: for in fact when they conquered the cities, they chose\r\nout the most comely of the boys and castrated them, making eunuchs of\r\nthem, and the fairest of the maidens they carried off by force to the\r\nking; and not only this, but they also burnt the cities together with\r\nthe temples. Thus for the third time had the Ionians been reduced\r\nto slavery, first by the Lydians and then twice in succession by the\r\nPersians.\r\n\r\n33. Departing from Ionia the fleet proceeded to conquer all the places\r\nof the Hellespont on the left as one sails in, for those on the right\r\nhad been subdued already by the Persians themselves, approaching them by\r\nland. Now the cities of the Hellespont in Europe are these:--first comes\r\nthe Chersonese, in which there are many cities, then Perinthos, the\r\nstrongholds of the Thracian border, Selymbria, and Byzantion. The people\r\nof Byzantion and those of Calchedon opposite did not even wait for\r\nthe coming of the Persian ships, but had left their own land first and\r\ndeparted, going within the Euxine; and there they settled in the city\r\nof Mesambria. 19 So the Phenicians, having burnt these places which have\r\nbeen mentioned, directed their course next to Proconnesos and Artake;\r\nand when they had delivered these also to the flames, they sailed back\r\nto the Chersonese to destroy the remaining cities which they had not\r\nsacked when they touched there before: but against Kyzicos they did\r\nnot sail at all; for the men of Kyzicos even before the time when the\r\nPhenicians sailed in had submitted to the king of their own accord, and\r\nhad made terms with Oibares the son of Megabazos, the Persian governor\r\nat Daskyleion. 20.\r\n\r\n34. In the Chersonese then the Phenicians made themselves masters of all\r\nthe other cities except the city of Cardia. Of these cities up to that\r\ntime Miltiades the son of Kimon, the son of Stesagoras, had been despot,\r\nMiltiades the son of Kypselos having obtained this government in the\r\nmanner which here follows:--The inhabitants of this Chersonese were\r\nDolonkian Thracians; and these Dolonkians, being hard pressed in war by\r\nthe Apsinthians, sent their kings to Delphi to consult the Oracle about\r\nthe war. And the Pythian prophetess answered them that they must bring\r\ninto their land as founder of a settlement the man who should first\r\noffer them hospitality as they returned from the temple. The Dolonkians\r\nthen passed along the Sacred Road through the land of the Phokians and\r\nof the Boeotians, and as no man invited them, they turned aside and came\r\nto Athens..\r\n\r\n35. Now at that time in Athens the government was held by Peisistratos,\r\nbut Miltiades also the son of Kypselos had some power, who belonged to\r\na family which kept four-horse chariot teams, and who was descended\r\noriginally from Aiacos and Egina, though in more recent times his family\r\nwas Athenian, Philaios the son of Ajax having been the first of his\r\nhouse who became an Athenian. This Miltiades was sitting in the entrance\r\nof his own dwelling, and seeing the Dolonkians going by with dress that\r\nwas not of the native Athenian fashion and with spears, he shouted to\r\nthem; and when they approached, he offered them lodging and hospitality.\r\nThey then having accepted and having been entertained by him, proceeded\r\nto declare all the utterances of the Oracle; and having declared it they\r\nasked him to do as the god had said: and Miltiades when he heard it\r\nwas at once disposed to agree, because he was vexed by the rule of\r\nPeisistratos and desired to be removed out of the way. He set out\r\ntherefore forthwith to Delphi to inquire of the Oracle whether he should\r\ndo that which the Dolonkians asked of him:.\r\n\r\n36, and as the Pythian prophetess also bade him do so, Miltiades the\r\nson of Kypselos, who had before this been victor at Olympia with a\r\nfour-horse chariot, now taking with him of the Athenians everyone who\r\ndesired to share in the expedition, sailed with the Dolonkians and took\r\npossession of the land: and they who had invited him to come to them\r\nmade him despot over them. First then he made a wall across the isthmus\r\nof the Chersonese from the city of Cardia to Pactye, in order that the\r\nApsinthians might not be able to invade the land and do them damage.\r\nNow the number of furlongs 21 across the isthmus at this place\r\nis six-and-thirty, and from this isthmus the Chersonese within is\r\naltogether four hundred and twenty furlongs in length..\r\n\r\n37. Having made a wall then across the neck of the Chersonese and having\r\nin this manner repelled the Apsinthians, Miltiades made war upon the\r\npeople of Lampsacos first of all others; and the people of Lampsacos\r\nlaid an ambush and took him prisoner. Now Miltiades had come to be a\r\nfriend 22 of Croesus the Lydian; and Croesus accordingly, being informed\r\nof this event, sent and commanded the people of Lampsacos to let\r\nMiltiades go; otherwise he threatened to destroy them utterly like a\r\npine-tree. 23 Then when the people of Lampsacos were perplexed in their\r\ncounsels as to what that saying should mean with which Croesus had\r\nthreatened them, namely that he would destroy them utterly like a\r\npine-tree, at length one of the elder men with difficulty perceived the\r\ntruth, and said that a pine alone of all trees when it has been cut\r\ndown does not put forth any further growth but perishes, being utterly\r\ndestroyed. The people of Lampsacos therefore fearing Croesus loosed\r\nMiltiades and let him go..\r\n\r\n38. He then escaped by means of Croesus, but afterwards he brought his\r\nlife to an end leaving no son to succeed him, but passing over his rule\r\nand his possessions to Stesagoras, who was the son of Kimon, his brother\r\non the mother's side: 24 and the people of the Chersonese still offer\r\nsacrifices to him after his death as it is usual to do to a founder, and\r\nhold in his honour a contest of horse-races and athletic exercises, in\r\nwhich none of the men of Lampsacos are allowed to contend. After this\r\nthere was war with those of Lampsacos; and it happened to Stesagoras\r\nalso that he died without leaving a son, having been struck on the head\r\nwith an axe in the City Hall by a man who pretended to be a deserter,\r\nbut who proved himself to be in fact an enemy and a rather hot one\r\nmoreover..\r\n\r\n39. Then after Stesagoras also had ended his life in this manner,\r\nMiltiades son of Kimon and brother of that Stesagoras who was dead, was\r\nsent in a trireme to the Chersonese to take possession of the government\r\nby the sons of Peisistratos, who had dealt well with him at Athens also,\r\npretending that they had had no share in the death of his father Kimon,\r\nof which in another part of the history I will set forth how it came\r\nto pass. 25 Now Miltiades, when he came to the Chersonese, kept himself\r\nwithin his house, paying honours in all appearance 26 to the memory\r\nof his brother Stesagoras; and the chief men of the inhabitants of the\r\nChersonese in every place, being informed of this, gathered themselves\r\ntogether from all the cities and came in a body to condole with him, and\r\nwhen they had come they were laid in bonds by him. Miltiades then was\r\nin possession of the Chersonese, supporting a body of five hundred\r\nmercenary troops; and he married the daughter of Oloros the king of the\r\nThracians, who was named Hegesipyle.\r\n\r\n40. Now this Miltiades son of Kimon had at the time of which we speak\r\nbut lately returned 27 to the Chersonese; and after he had returned,\r\nthere befell him other misfortunes worse than those which had befallen\r\nhim already; for two years before this he had been a fugitive out of\r\nthe land from the Scythians, since the nomad Scythians provoked by king\r\nDareios had joined all in a body and marched as far as this Chersonese,\r\nand Miltiades had not awaited their attack but had become a fugitive\r\nfrom the Chersonese, until at last the Scythians departed and the\r\nDolonkians brought him back again. These things happened two years\r\nbefore the calamities which now oppressed him:.\r\n\r\n41, and now, being informed that the Phenicians were at Tenedos, he\r\nfilled five triremes with the property which he had at hand and sailed\r\naway for Athens. And having set out from the city of Cardia he was\r\nsailing through the gulf of Melas; and as he passed along by the shore\r\nof the Chersonese, the Phenicians fell in with his ships, and while\r\nMiltiades himself with four of his ships escaped to Imbros, the fifth of\r\nhis ships was captured in the pursuit by the Phenicians. Of this ship\r\nit chanced that Metiochos the eldest of the sons of Miltiades was in\r\ncommand, not born of the daughter of Oloros the Thracian, but of another\r\nwoman. Him the Phenicians captured together with his ship; and being\r\ninformed about him, that he was the son of Miltiades, they brought him\r\nup to the king, supposing that they would lay up for themselves a great\r\nobligation; because it was Miltiades who had declared as his opinion to\r\nthe Ionians that they should do as the Scythians said, at that time when\r\nthe Scythians requested them to break up the bridge of boats and sail\r\naway to their own land. Dareios however, when the Phenicians brought up\r\nto him Metiochos the son of Miltiades, did Metiochos no harm but on the\r\ncontrary very much good; for he gave him a house and possessions and\r\na Persian wife, by whom he had children born who have been ranked as\r\nPersians. Miltiades meanwhile came from Imbros to Athens.\r\n\r\n42. In the course of this year there was done by the Persians nothing\r\nmore which tended to strife with the Ionians, but these things which\r\nfollow were done in this year very much to their advantage.--Artaphrenes\r\nthe governor of Sardis sent for envoys from all the cities and compelled\r\nthe Ionians to make agreements among themselves, so that they might\r\ngive satisfaction for wrongs and not plunder one another's land. This\r\nhe compelled them to do, and also he measured their territories by\r\nparasangs,--that is the name which the Persians give to the length\r\nof thirty furlongs, 28--he measured, I say, by these, and appointed\r\na certain amount of tribute for each people, which continues still\r\nunaltered from that time even to my own days, as it was appointed by\r\nArtaphrenes; and the tribute was appointed to be nearly of the same\r\namount for each as it had been before..\r\n\r\n43. These were things which tended to peace for the Ionians; but at the\r\nbeginning of the spring, the other commanders having all been removed\r\nby the king, Mardonios the son of Gobryas came down to the sea, bringing\r\nwith him a very large land-army and a very large naval force, being a\r\nyoung man and lately married to Artozostra daughter of king Dareios.\r\nWhen Mardonios leading this army came to Kilikia, he embarked on board\r\na ship himself and proceeded together with the other ships, while other\r\nleaders led the land-army to the Hellespont. Mardonios however sailing\r\nalong the coast of Asia came to Ionia: and here I shall relate a thing\r\nwhich will be a great marvel to those of the Hellenes who do not believe\r\nthat to the seven men of the Persians Otanes declared as his opinion\r\nthat the Persians ought to have popular rule; 29 for Mardonios deposed\r\nall the despots of the Ionians and established popular governments in\r\nthe cities. Having so done he hastened on to the Hellespont; and when\r\nthere was collected a vast number of ships and a large land-army, they\r\ncrossed over the Hellespont in the ships and began to make their way\r\nthrough Europe, and their way was directed against Eretria and Athens..\r\n\r\n44. These, I say, furnished them the pretence for the expedition,\r\nbut they had it in their minds to subdue as many as they could of the\r\nHellenic cities; and in the first place they subdued with their ships\r\nthe Thasians, who did not even raise a hand to defend themselves: then\r\nwith the land-army they gained the Macedonians to be their servants in\r\naddition to those whom they had already; for all the nations on the East\r\nof the Macedonians 30 had become subject to them already before this.\r\nCrossing over then from Thasos to the opposite coast, they proceeded\r\non their way near the land as far as Acanthos, and then starting from\r\nAcanthos they attempted to get round Mount Athos; but as they sailed\r\nround, there fell upon them a violent North Wind, against which they\r\ncould do nothing, and handled them very roughly, casting away very many\r\nof their ships on Mount Athos. It is said indeed that the number of the\r\nships destroyed was three hundred, 3001, and more than twenty thousand\r\nmen; for as this sea which is about Athos is very full of sea monsters,\r\nsome were seized by these and so perished, while others were dashed\r\nagainst the rocks; and some of them did not know how to swim and\r\nperished for that cause, others again by reason of cold..\r\n\r\n45. Thus fared the fleet; and meanwhile Mardonios and the land-army\r\nwhile encamping in Macedonia were attacked in the night by the Brygian\r\nThracians, and many of them were slain by the Brygians and Mardonios\r\nhimself was wounded. However not even these escaped being enslaved by\r\nthe Persians, for Mardonios did not depart from that region until he had\r\nmade them subject. But when he had subdued these, he proceeded to lead\r\nhis army back, since he had suffered great loss with his land-army in\r\nfighting against the Brygians and with his fleet in going round Athos.\r\nSo this expedition departed back to Asia having gained no honour by its\r\ncontests.\r\n\r\n46. In the next year after this Dareios first sent a messenger to the\r\nmen of Thasos, who had been accused by their neighbours of planning\r\nrevolt, and bade them take away the wall around their town and bring\r\ntheir ships to Abdera. The Thasians in fact, as they had been besieged\r\nby Histiaios the Milesian and at the same time had large revenues coming\r\nin, were using their money in building ships of war and in surrounding\r\ntheir city with a stronger wall. Now the revenues came to them from the\r\nmainland and from the mines: from the gold-mines in Scapte Hyle 31 there\r\ncame in generally eighty talents a year, and from those in Thasos itself\r\na smaller amount than this but so much that in general the Thasians,\r\nwithout taxes upon the produce of their soil, had a revenue from the\r\nmainland and from the mines amounting yearly to two hundred talents, and\r\nwhen the amount was highest, to three hundred..\r\n\r\n47. I myself saw these mines, and by much the most marvellous of\r\nthem were those which the Phenicians discovered, who made the first\r\nsettlement in this island in company with Thasos; and the island had the\r\nname which it now has from this Thasos the Phenician. These Phenician\r\nmines are in that part of Thasos which is between the places called\r\nAinyra and Koinyra and opposite Samothrake, where there is a great\r\nmountain which has been all turned up in the search for metal. Thus it\r\nis with this matter: and the Thasians on the command of the king both\r\nrazed their walls and brought all their ships to Abdera.\r\n\r\n48. After this Dareios began to make trial of the Hellenes, what they\r\nmeant to do, whether to make war with him or to deliver themselves up.\r\nHe sent abroad heralds therefore, and appointed them to go some to one\r\nplace and others to another throughout Hellas, bidding them demand earth\r\nand water for the king. These, I say, he sent to Hellas; and meanwhile\r\nhe was sending abroad other heralds to his own tributary cities which\r\nlay upon the sea-coast, and he bade them have ships of war built and\r\nalso vessels to carry horses..\r\n\r\n49. They then were engaged in preparing these things; and meanwhile\r\nwhen the heralds had come to Hellas, many of those who dwelt upon the\r\nmainland gave that for which the Persian made demand, 32 and all those\r\nwho dwelt in the islands did so, to whomsoever they came to make their\r\ndemand. The islanders, I say, gave earth and water to Dareios, and among\r\nthem also those of Egina, and when these had done so, the Athenians went\r\nforthwith urgent against them, supposing that the Eginetans had given\r\nwith hostile purpose against themselves, in order to make an expedition\r\nagainst them in combination with the Persians; and also they were glad\r\nto get hold of an occasion against them. Accordingly they went backward\r\nand forwards to Sparta and accused the Eginetans of that which they had\r\ndone, as having proved themselves traitors to Hellas..\r\n\r\n50. In consequence of this accusation Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides,\r\nking of the Spartans, crossed over to Egina meaning to seize those of\r\nthe Eginetans who were the most guilty; but as he was attempting\r\nto seize them, certain of the Eginetans opposed him, and among them\r\nespecially Crios the son of Polycritos, who said that he should not with\r\nimpunity carry off a single Eginetan, for he was doing this (said he)\r\nwithout authority from the Spartan State, having been persuaded to it by\r\nthe Athenians with money; otherwise he would have come and seized them\r\nin company with the other king: and this he said by reason of a message\r\nreceived from Demaratos. Cleomenes then as he departed from Egina, asked\r\nCrios 33 what was his name, and he told him the truth; and Cleomenes\r\nsaid to him: \"Surely now, O Ram, thou must cover over thy horns with\r\nbronze for thou wilt shortly have a great trouble to contend with.\"\r\n\r\n51. Meanwhile Demaratos the son of Ariston was staying behind in Sparta\r\nand bringing charges against Cleomenes, he also being king of the\r\nSpartans but of the inferior house; which however is inferior in no\r\nother way (for it is descended from the same ancestor), but the house of\r\nEurysthenes has always been honoured more, apparently because he was the\r\nelder brother..\r\n\r\n52. For the Lacedemonians, who herein agree with none of the poets, say\r\nthat Aristodemos the son of Aristomachos, the son of Cleodaios, the\r\nson of Hyllos, being their king, led them himself (and not the sons of\r\nAristodemos) to this land which they now possess. Then after no long\r\ntime the wife of Aristodemos, whose name was Argeia,--she was the\r\ndaughter, they say, of Autesion, the son of Tisamenes, the son of\r\nThersander, the son of Polyneikes,--she, it is said, brought forth\r\ntwins; and Aristodemos lived but to see his children and then ended his\r\nlife by sickness. So the Lacedemonians of that time resolved according\r\nto established custom to make the elder of the children their king; but\r\nthey did not know which of them they should take, because they were like\r\none another and of equal size; and when they were not able to make out,\r\nor even before this, they inquired of their mother; and she said\r\nthat even she herself did not know one from the other. She said this,\r\nalthough she knew in truth very well, because she desired that by some\r\nmeans both might be made kings. The Lacedemonians then were in a strait;\r\nand being in a strait they sent to Delphi to inquire what they should do\r\nin the matter. And the Pythian prophetess bade them regard both children\r\nas their kings, but honour most the first in age. 34 The prophetess,\r\nthey say, thus gave answer to them; and when the Lacedemonians were at a\r\nloss none the less how to find out the elder of them, a Messenian\r\nwhose name was Panites made a suggestion to them: this Panites, I say,\r\nsuggested to the Lacedemonians that they should watch the mother and see\r\nwhich of the children she washed and fed before the other; and if she\r\nwas seen to do this always in the same order, then they would have all\r\nthat they were seeking and desiring to find out, but if she too was\r\nuncertain and did it in a different order at different times, it would\r\nbe plain to them that even she had no more knowledge than any other,\r\nand they must turn to some other way. Then the Spartans following\r\nthe suggestion of the Messenian watched the mother of the sons of\r\nAristodemos and found that she gave honour thus to the first-born both\r\nin feeding and in washing; for she did not know with that design she was\r\nbeing watched. They took therefore the child which was honoured by its\r\nmother and brought it up as the first-born in the public hall, 35 and\r\nto it was given the name of Eurysthenes, while the other was called\r\nProcles. These, when they had grown up, both themselves were at\r\nvariance, they say, with one another, though they were brothers,\r\nthroughout the whole time of their lives, and their descendants also\r\ncontinued after the same manner.\r\n\r\n53. This is the report given by the Lacedemonians alone of all the\r\nHellenes; but this which follows I write in accordance with that which\r\nis reported by the Hellenes generally,--I mean that the names of these\r\nkings of the Dorians are rightly enumerated by the Hellenes up to\r\nPerseus the son of Danae (leaving the god out of account), 36 and proved\r\nto be of Hellenic race; for even from that time they were reckoned as\r\nHellenes. I said \"up to Perseus\" and did not take the descent from a yet\r\nhigher point, because there is no name mentioned of a mortal father for\r\nPerseus, as Amphitryon is for Heracles. Therefore with reason, as is\r\nevident, I have said \"rightly up to Perseus\"; but if one enumerates\r\ntheir ancestors in succession going back from Danae the daughter of\r\nAcrisios, the rulers of the Dorians will prove to be Egyptians by direct\r\ndescent..\r\n\r\n54. Thus I have traced the descent according to the account given by the\r\nHellenes; but as the story is reported which the Persians tell, Perseus\r\nhimself was an Assyrian and became a Hellene, whereas the ancestors of\r\nPerseus were not Hellenes; and as for the ancestors of Acrisios, who\r\n(according to this account) belonged not to Perseus in any way by\r\nkinship, they say that these were, as the Hellenes report, Egyptians..\r\n\r\n55. Let it suffice to have said so much about these matters; and as to\r\nthe question how and by what exploits being Egyptians they received the\r\nsceptres of royalty over the Dorians, we will omit these things, since\r\nothers have told about them; but the things with which other narrators\r\nhave not dealt, of these I will make mention.\r\n\r\n56. These are the royal rights which have been given by the Spartans\r\nto their kings, namely, two priesthoods, of Zeus Lakedaimon and Zeus\r\nUranios; 37 and the right of making war against whatsoever land they\r\nplease, and that no man of the Spartans shall hinder this right, or\r\nif he do, he shall be subject to the curse; and that when they go on\r\nexpeditions the kings shall go out first and return last; that a hundred\r\npicked men shall be their guard upon expeditions; and that they shall\r\nuse in their goings forth to war as many cattle as they desire, and take\r\nboth the hides and the backs of all that are sacrificed..\r\n\r\n57. These are their privileges in war; and in peace moreover things have\r\nbeen assigned to them as follows:--if any sacrifice is performed at the\r\npublic charge, it is the privilege of the kings to sit down at the feast\r\nbefore all others, and that the attendants shall begin with them first,\r\nand serve to each of them a portion of everything double of that which\r\nis given to the other guests, and that they shall have the first pouring\r\nof libations and the hides of the animals slain in sacrifice; that on\r\nevery new moon and seventh day of the month there shall be delivered at\r\nthe public charge to each one of these a full-grown victim in the temple\r\nof Apollo, and a measure 38 of barley-groats and a Laconian \"quarter\"\r\n39 of wine; and that at all the games they shall have seats of honour\r\nspecially set apart for them: moreover it is their privilege to appoint\r\nas protectors of strangers 40 whomsoever they will of the citizens, and\r\nto choose each two \"Pythians:\" now the Pythians are men sent to consult\r\nthe god at Delphi, and they eat with the kings at the public charge. And\r\nif the kings do not come to the dinner, it is the rule that there shall\r\nbe sent out for them to their houses two quarts 41 of barley-groats for\r\neach one and half a pint 42 of wine; but if they are present, double\r\nshares of everything shall be given them, and moreover they shall be\r\nhonoured in this same manner when they have been invited to dinner by\r\nprivate persons. The kings also, it is ordained, shall have charge of\r\nthe oracles which are given, but the Pythians also shall have knowledge\r\nof them. It is the rule moreover that the kings alone give decision on\r\nthe following cases only, that is to say, about the maiden who inherits\r\nher father's property, namely who ought to have her, if her father have\r\nnot betrothed her to any one, and about public ways; also if any man\r\ndesires to adopt a son, he must do it in presence of the kings: and it\r\nis ordained that they shall sit in council with the Senators, who are in\r\nnumber eight-and-twenty, and if they do not come, those of the Senators\r\nwho are most closely related to them shall have the privileges of the\r\nkings and give two votes besides their own, making three in all. 4201.\r\n\r\n58. These rights have been assigned to the kings for their lifetime by\r\nthe Spartan State; and after they are dead these which follow:--horsemen\r\ngo round and announce that which has happened throughout the whole of\r\nthe Laconian land, and in the city women go about and strike upon\r\na copper kettle. Whenever this happens so, two free persons of each\r\nhousehold must go into mourning, a man and a woman, and for those who\r\nfail to do this great penalties are appointed. Now the custom of the\r\nLacedemonians about the deaths of their kings is the same as that of the\r\nBarbarians who dwell in Asia, for most of the Barbarians practise the\r\nsame customs as regards the death of their kings. Whensoever a king of\r\nthe Lacedemonians is dead, then from the whole territory of Lacedemon,\r\nnot reckoning the Spartans, a certain fixed number of the \"dwellers\r\nround\" 43 are compelled to go to the funeral ceremony:\r\n\r\n59. and when there have been gathered together of these and of the\r\nHelots and of the Spartans themselves many thousands in the same place,\r\nwith their women intermingled, they beat their foreheads with a good\r\nwill and make lamentation without stint, saying that this one who has\r\ndied last of their kings was the best of all: and whenever any of their\r\nkings has been killed in war, they prepare an image to represent him,\r\nlaid upon a couch with fair coverings, and carry it out to be buried.\r\nThen after they have buried him, no assembly is held among them for ten\r\ndays, nor is there any meeting for choice of magistrates, but they have\r\nmourning during these days. In another respect too these resemble the\r\nPersians; that is to say, when the king is dead and another is appointed\r\nking, this king who is newly coming in sets free any man of the Spartans\r\nwho was a debtor to the king or to the State; while among the Persians\r\nthe king who comes to the throne remits to all the cities the arrears of\r\ntribute which are due.\r\n\r\n60. In the following point also the Lacedemonians resemble the\r\nEgyptians; that is to say, their heralds and fluteplayers and cooks\r\ninherit the crafts of their fathers, and a fluteplayer is the son of a\r\nfluteplayer, a cook of a cook, and a herald of a herald; other men do\r\nnot lay hands upon the office because they have loud and clear voices,\r\nand so shut them out of it, but they practise their craft by inheritance\r\nfrom their fathers.\r\n\r\n61. Thus are these things done: and at this time of which we speak, 44\r\nwhile Cleomenes was in Egina doing deeds 45 which were for the common\r\nservice of Hellas, Demaratos brought charges against him, not so much\r\nbecause he cared for the Eginetans as because he felt envy and jealousy\r\nof him. Then Cleomenes, after he returned from Egina, planned to depose\r\nDemaratos from being king, making an attempt upon him on account of this\r\nmatter which follows:--Ariston being king in Sparta and having married\r\ntwo wives, yet had no children born to him; and since he did not\r\nacknowledge that he himself was the cause of this, he married a third\r\nwife; and he married her thus:--he had a friend, a man of the Spartans,\r\nto whom of all the citizens Ariston was most inclined; and it chanced\r\nthat this man had a wife who was of all the women in Sparta the fairest\r\nby far, and one too who had become the fairest from having been the\r\nfoulest. For as she was mean in her aspect, her nurse, considering that\r\nshe was the daughter of wealthy persons and was of uncomely aspect, and\r\nseeing moreover that her parents were troubled by it,--perceiving I say\r\nthese things, her nurse devised as follows:--every day she bore her to\r\nthe temple of Helen, which is in the place called Therapne, lying above\r\nthe temple of Phoebus; and whenever the nurse bore her thither, she\r\nplaced her before the image and prayed the goddess to deliver the child\r\nfrom her unshapeliness. And once as the nurse was going away out of the\r\ntemple, it is said that a woman appeared to her, and having appeared\r\nasked her what she was bearing in her arms; and she told her that she\r\nwas bearing a child; upon which the other bade her show the child to\r\nher, but she refused, for it had been forbidden to her by the parents to\r\nshow it to any one: but the woman continued to urge her by all means to\r\nshow it to her. So then perceiving that the woman earnestly desired to\r\nsee it, the nurse showed her the child. Then the woman stroking the head\r\nof the child said that she should be the fairest of all the women in\r\nSparta; and from that day her aspect was changed. Afterwards when she\r\ncame to the age for marriage, she was married to Agetos the son of\r\nAlkeides, this friend of Ariston of whom we spoke..\r\n\r\n62. Now Ariston it seems was ever stung by the desire of this woman, and\r\naccordingly he contrived as follows:--he made an engagement himself with\r\nhis comrade, whose wife this woman was, that he would give him as a gift\r\none thing of his own possessions, whatsoever he should choose, and he\r\nbade his comrade make return to him in similar fashion. He therefore,\r\nfearing nothing for his wife, because he saw that Ariston also had\r\na wife, agreed to this; and on these terms they imposed oaths on one\r\nanother. After this Ariston on his part gave that which Agetos had\r\nchosen from the treasures of Ariston, whatever the thing was; and he\r\nhimself, seeking to obtain from him the like return, endeavoured then\r\nto take away the wife of his comrade from him: and he said that he\r\nconsented to give anything else except this one thing only, but at\r\nlength being compelled by the oath and by the treacherous deception, 46\r\nhe allowed her to be taken away from him..\r\n\r\n63. Thus had Ariston brought into his house the third wife, having\r\ndismissed the second: and this wife, not having fulfilled the ten months\r\n47 but in a shorter period of time, bore him that Demaratos of whom we\r\nwere speaking; and one of his servants reported to him as he was sitting\r\nin council 48 with the Ephors, that a son had been born to him. He then,\r\nknowing the time when he took to him his wife, and reckoning the months\r\nupon his fingers, said, denying with an oath, \"The child would not\r\nbe mine.\" This the Ephors heard, but they thought it a matter of no\r\nimportance at the moment; and the child grew up and Ariston repented of\r\nthat which he had said, for he thought Demaratos was certainly his\r\nown son; and he gave him the name \"Demaratos\" for this reason, namely\r\nbecause before these things took place the Spartan people all in a body\r\n49 had made a vow 50 praying that a son might be born to Ariston, as one\r\nwho was pre-eminent in renown over all the kings who had ever arisen in\r\nSparta.\r\n\r\n64. For this reason the name Demaratos 51 was given to him. And as time\r\nwent on Ariston died, and Demaratos obtained the kingdom: but it was\r\nfated apparently that these things should become known and should cause\r\nDemaratos to be deposed from the kingdom; and therefore 52 Demaratos\r\ncame to be at variance greatly with Cleomenes both at the former time\r\nwhen he withdrew his army from Eleusis, and also now especially, when\r\nCleomenes had crossed over to take those of the Eginetans who had gone\r\nover to the Medes..\r\n\r\n65. Cleomenes then, being anxious to take vengeance on him, concerted\r\nmatters with Leotychides the son of Menares, the son of Agis, who was of\r\nthe same house as Demaratos, under condition that if he should set\r\nhim up as king instead of Demaratos, he would go with him against the\r\nEginetans. Now Leotychides had become a bitter foe of Demaratos on\r\naccount of this matter which follows:--Leotychides had betrothed himself\r\nto Percalos the daughter of Chilon son of Demarmenos; and Demaratos\r\nplotted against him and deprived Leotychides of his marriage, carrying\r\noff Percalos himself beforehand, and getting her for his wife. Thus\r\nhad arisen the enmity of Leotychides against Demaratos; and now by the\r\ninstigation of Cleomenes Leotychides deposed against Demaratos, saying\r\nthat he was not rightfully reigning over the Spartans, not being a son\r\nof Ariston: and after this deposition he prosecuted a suit against him,\r\nrecalling the old saying which Ariston uttered at the time when his\r\nservant reported to him that a son was born to him, and he reckoning up\r\nthe months denied with an oath, saying that it was not his. Taking his\r\nstand upon this utterance, Leotychides proceeded to prove that Demaratos\r\nwas not born of Ariston nor was rightfully reigning over Sparta; and he\r\nproduced as witnesses those Ephors who chanced then to have been sitting\r\nwith Ariston in council and to have heard him say this..\r\n\r\n66. At last, as there was contention about those matters, the Spartans\r\nresolved to ask the Oracle at Delphi whether Demaratos was the son of\r\nAriston. The question then having been referred by the arrangement of\r\nCleomenes to the Pythian prophetess, thereupon Cleomenes gained over to\r\nhis side Cobon the son of Aristophantos, who had most power among the\r\nDelphians, and Cobin persuaded Perialla the prophetess of the Oracle\r\n53 to say that which Cleomenes desired to have said. Thus the Pythian\r\nprophetess, when those who were sent to consult the god asked her their\r\nquestion, gave decision that Demaratos was not the son of Ariston.\r\nAfterwards however these things became known, and both Cobon went into\r\nexile from Delphi and Perialla the prophetess of the Oracle was removed\r\nfrom her office.\r\n\r\n67. With regard to the deposing of Demaratos from the kingdom it\r\nhappened thus: but Demaratos became an exile from Sparta to the Medes\r\non account of a reproach which here follows:--After he had been deposed\r\nfrom the kingdom Demaratos was holding a public office to which he had\r\nbeen elected. Now it was the time of the Gymnopaidiai; and as Demaratos\r\nwas a spectator of them, Leotychides, who had now become king himself\r\ninstead of Demaratos, sent his attendant and asked Demaratos in mockery\r\nand insult what kind of a thing it was to be a magistrate after having\r\nbeen king; and he vexed at the question made answer and said that he\r\nhimself had now had experience of both, but Leotychides had not; this\r\nquestion however, he said, would be the beginning either of countless\r\nevil or countless good fortune for the Lacedemonians. Having thus said,\r\nhe veiled his head and went forth out of the theatre to his own house;\r\nand forthwith he made preparations and sacrificed an ox to Zeus, and\r\nafter having sacrificed he called his mother..\r\n\r\n68. Then when his mother had come, he put into her hands some of the\r\ninner parts 54 of the victim, and besought her, saying as follows:\r\n\"Mother, I beseech thee, appealing to the other gods and above all to\r\nthis Zeus the guardian of the household, 55 to tell me the truth, who is\r\nreally and truly my father. For Leotychides spoke in his contention\r\nwith me, saying that thou didst come to Ariston with child by thy former\r\nhusband; and others besides, reporting that which is doubtless an idle\r\ntale, 56 say that thou didst go in to one of the servants, namely the\r\nkeeper of the asses, and that I am his son. I therefore entreat thee by\r\nthe gods to tell me the truth; for if thou hast done any of these things\r\nwhich are reported, thou hast not done them alone, but with many other\r\nwomen; and the report is commonly believed in Sparta that there was not\r\nin Ariston seed which should beget children; for if so, then his former\r\nwives also would have borne children.\".\r\n\r\n69. Thus he spoke, and she made answer as follows: \"My son, since thou\r\ndost beseech me with entreaties to speak the truth, the whole truth\r\nshall be told to thee. When Ariston had brought me into his house, on\r\nthe third night 57 there came to me an apparition in the likeness of\r\nAriston, and having lain with me it put upon me the garlands which it\r\nhad on; and the apparition straitway departed, and after this Ariston\r\ncame; and when he saw me with garlands, he asked who it was who had\r\ngiven me them; and I said that he had given them, but he did not admit\r\nit; and I began to take oath of it, saying that he did not well to deny\r\nit, for he had come (I said) a short time before and had lain with me\r\nand given me the garlands. Then Ariston, seeing that I made oath of it,\r\nperceived that the matter was of the gods; and first the garlands were\r\nfound to be from the hero-temple which stands by the outer door of the\r\nhouse, which they call the temple of Astrabacos, 58 and secondly the\r\ndiviners gave answer that it was this same hero. Thus, my son, thou hast\r\nall, as much as thou desirest to learn; for either thou art begotten\r\nof this hero and the hero Astrabacos is thy father, or Ariston is thy\r\nfather, for on that night I conceived thee: but as to that wherein thy\r\nfoes most take hold of thee, saying that Ariston himself, when thy birth\r\nwas announced to him, in the hearing of many declared that thou wert\r\nnot his son, because the time, the ten months namely, had not yet been\r\nfulfilled, in ignorance of such matters he cast forth that saying;\r\nfor women bring forth children both at the ninth month and also at the\r\nseventh, and not all after they have completed ten months; and I bore\r\nthee, my son, at the seventh month: and Ariston himself also perceived\r\nafter no long time that he had uttered this saying in folly. Do not thou\r\nthen accept any other reports about thy begetting, for thou hast heard\r\nin all the full truth; but to Leotychides and to those who report these\r\nthings may their wives bear children by keepers of asses!\"\r\n\r\n70. Thus she spoke; and he, having learnt that which he desired to\r\nlearn, took supplies for travelling and set forth to go to Elis,\r\npretending that he was going to Delphi to consult the Oracle: but the\r\nLacedemonians, suspecting that he was attempting to escape, pursued\r\nafter him; and it chanced that before they came Demaratos had passed\r\nover to Zakynthos from Elis; and the Lacedemonians crossing over after\r\nhim laid hands on his person and carried away his attendants from him.\r\nAfterwards however, since those of Zakynthos refused to give him up, he\r\npassed over from thence to Asia, to the presence of king Dareios; and\r\nDareios both received him with great honour as a guest, and also gave\r\nhim land and cities. Thus Demaratos had come to Asia, and such was the\r\nfortune which he had had, having been distinguished in the estimation of\r\nthe Lacedemonians 59 in many other ways both by deeds and by counsels,\r\nand especially having gained for them an Olympic victory with the\r\nfour-horse chariot, being the only one who achieved this of all the\r\nkings who ever arose in Sparta.\r\n\r\n71. Demaratos being deposed, Leotychides the son of Menares succeeded to\r\nthe kingdom; and he had born to him a son Zeuxidemos, whom some of the\r\nSpartans called Kyniscos. This Zeuxidemos did not become king of\r\nSparta, for he died before Leotychides, leaving a son Archidemos: and\r\nLeotychides having lost Zeuxidemos married a second wife Eurydame, the\r\nsister of Menios and daughter of Diactorides, by whom he had no male\r\nissue, but a daughter Lampito, whom Archidemos the son of Zeuxidemos\r\ntook in marriage, she being given to him by Leotychides..\r\n\r\n72. Leotychides however did not himself 60 live to old age in Sparta,\r\nbut paid a retribution for Demaratos as follows:--he went as commander\r\nof the Lacedemonians to invade Thessaly, and when he might have reduced\r\nall to subjection, he accepted gifts of money amounting to a large sum;\r\nand being taken in the act there in the camp, as he was sitting upon a\r\nglove full of money, he was brought to trial and banished from Sparta,\r\nand his house was razed to the ground. So he went into exile to Tegea\r\nand ended his life there..\r\n\r\n73. These things happened later; but at this time, when Cleomenes had\r\nbrought to a successful issue the affair which concerned Demaratos,\r\nforthwith he took with him Leotychides and went against the Eginetans,\r\nbeing very greatly enraged with them because of their insults towards\r\nhim. So the Eginetans on their part, since both the kings had come\r\nagainst them, thought fit no longer to resist; and the Spartans selected\r\nten men who were the most considerable among the Eginetans both by\r\nwealth and by birth, and took them away as prisoners, and among\r\nothers also Crios 61 the son of Polycritos and Casambos the son of\r\nAristocrates, who had the greatest power among them; and having taken\r\nthese away to the land of Attica, they deposited them as a charge with\r\nthe Athenians, who were the bitterest enemies of the Eginetans.\r\n\r\n74. After this Cleomenes, since it had become known that he had devised\r\nevil against Demaratos, was seized by fear of the Spartans and retired\r\nto Thessaly. Thence he came to Arcadia, and began to make mischief 62\r\nand to combine the Arcadians against Sparta; and besides other oaths\r\nwith which he caused them to swear that they would assuredly follow him\r\nwhithersoever he should lead them, he was very desirous also to bring\r\nthe chiefs of the Arcadians to the city of Nonacris and cause them\r\nto swear by the water of Styx; for near this city it is said by the\r\nArcadians 63 that there is the water of Styx, and there is in fact\r\nsomething of this kind: a small stream of water is seen to trickle down\r\nfrom a rock into a hollow ravine, and round the ravine runs a wall\r\nof rough stones. Now Nonacris, where it happens that this spring is\r\nsituated, is a city of Arcadia near Pheneos..\r\n\r\n75. The Lacedemonians, hearing that Cleomenes was acting thus, were\r\nafraid, and proceeded to bring him back to Sparta to rule on the same\r\nterms as before: but when he had come back, forthwith a disease of\r\nmadness seized him (who had been even before this somewhat insane 64),\r\nand whenever he met any of the Spartans, he dashed his staff against the\r\nman's face. And as he continued to do this and had gone quite out of his\r\nsenses, his kinsmen bound him in stocks. Then being so bound, and seeing\r\nhis warder left alone by the rest, he asked him for a knife; and the\r\nwarder not being at first willing to give it, he threatened him with\r\nthat which he would do to him afterwards if he did not; until at last\r\nthe warder fearing the threats, for he was one of the Helots, gave him a\r\nknife. Then Cleomenes, when he had received the steel, began to\r\nmaltreat himself from the legs upwards: for he went on cutting his flesh\r\nlengthways from the legs to the thighs and from the thighs to the loins\r\nand flanks, until at last he came to the belly; and cutting this\r\ninto strips he died in that manner. And this happened, as most of the\r\nHellenes report, because he persuaded the Pythian prophetess to advise\r\nthat which was done about Demaratos; but as the Athenians alone\r\nreport, it was because when he invaded Eleusis he laid waste the sacred\r\nenclosure of the goddesses; 65 and according to the report of the\r\nArgives, because from their sanctuary dedicated to Argos he caused to\r\ncome down those of the Argives who had fled for refuge from the battle\r\nand slew them, and also set fire to the grove itself, holding it in no\r\nregard..\r\n\r\n76. For when Cleomenes was consulting the Oracle at Delphi, the answer\r\nwas given him that he should conquer Argos; so he led the Spartans and\r\ncame to the river Erasinos, which is said to flow from the Stymphalian\r\nlake; for this lake, they say, running out into a viewless chasm,\r\nappears again above ground in the land of Argos; and from thence onwards\r\nthis water is called by the Argives Erasinos: having come, I say, to\r\nthis river, Cleomenes did sacrifice to it; and since the sacrifices were\r\nnot at all favourable for him to cross over, he said that he admired\r\nthe Erasinos for not betraying the men of its country, but the Argives\r\nshould not even so escape. After this he retired back from thence and\r\nled his army down to Thyrea; and having done sacrifice to the Sea by\r\nslaying a bull, he brought them in ships to the land of Tiryns and\r\nNauplia..\r\n\r\n77. Being informed of this, the Argives came to the rescue towards the\r\nsea; and when they had got near Tiryns and were at the place which is\r\ncalled Hesipeia, 66 they encamped opposite to the Lacedemonians leaving\r\nno very wide space between the armies. There the Argives were not afraid\r\nof the open fighting, but only lest they should be conquered by\r\ncraft; for to this they thought referred the oracle which the Pythian\r\nprophetess gave in common to these and to the Milesians, 67 saying as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"But when the female at length shall conquer the male in the battle,\r\n  Conquer and drive him forth, and glory shall gain among Argives,\r\n  Then many wives of the Argives shall tear both cheeks in their mourning;\r\n  So that a man shall say some time, of the men that came after,\r\n  'Quelled by the spear it perished, the three-coiled terrible serpent,'\r\n\r\nThe conjunction of all these things caused fear to the Argives, and\r\nwith a view to this they resolved to make use of the enemy's herald;\r\nand having so resolved they proceeded to do as follows:--whenever the\r\nSpartan herald proclaimed anything to the Lacedemonians, the Argives\r\nalso did that same thing..\r\n\r\n78. So Cleomenes, perceiving that the Argives were doing whatever\r\nthe herald of the Lacedemonians proclaimed, passed the word to the\r\nLacedemonians that when the herald should proclaim that they were to\r\nget breakfast, then they should take up their arms and go to attack the\r\nArgives. This was carried out even so by the Lacedemonians; for as the\r\nArgives were getting breakfast according to the herald's proclamation,\r\nthey attacked them; and many of them they slew, but many more yet took\r\nrefuge in the sacred grove of Argos, and upon these they kept watch,\r\nsitting round about the place. Then Cleomenes did this which follows:--\r\n\r\n79. He had with him deserters, and getting information by inquiring of\r\nthese, he sent a herald and summoned forth those of the Argives who were\r\nshut up in the sanctuary, mentioning each by name; and he summoned\r\nthem forth saying that he had received their ransom. Now among the\r\nPeloponnesians ransom is two pounds weight of silver 68 appointed to be\r\npaid for each prisoner. So Cleomenes summoned forth about fifty of the\r\nArgives one by one and slew them; and it chanced that the rest who were\r\nin the enclosure did not perceive that this was being done; for since\r\nthe grove was thick, those within did not see how it fared with those\r\nwho were without, at least until one of them climbed up a tree and saw\r\nfrom above that which was being done. Accordingly they then no longer\r\ncame forth when they were called.\r\n\r\n80. So Cleomenes thereupon ordered all the Helots to pile up brushwood\r\nround the sacred grove; and they obeying, he set fire to the grove. And\r\nwhen it was now burning, he asked one of the deserters to what god the\r\ngrove was sacred, and the man replied that it was sacred to Argos. When\r\nhe heard that, he groaned aloud and said, \"Apollo who utterest oracles,\r\nsurely thou hast greatly deceived me, saying that I should conquer\r\nArgos: I conjecture that the oracle has had its fulfilment for me\r\nalready.\".\r\n\r\n81. After this Cleomenes sent away the greater part of his army to go\r\nback to Sparta, but he himself took a thousand of the best men and went\r\nto the temple of Hera to sacrifice: and when he wished to sacrifice upon\r\nthe altar, the priest forbade him, saying that it was not permitted\r\nby religious rule for a stranger to sacrifice in that place. Cleomenes\r\nhowever bade the Helots take away the priest from the altar and scourge\r\nhim, and he himself offered the sacrifice. Having so done he returned\r\nback to Sparta;.\r\n\r\n82, and after his return his opponents brought him up before the Ephors,\r\nsaying that he had received gifts and therefore had not conquered Argos,\r\nwhen he might easily have conquered it. He said to them,--but whether\r\nhe was speaking falsely or whether truly I am not able with certainty to\r\nsay,--however that may be, he spoke and said that when he had conquered\r\nthe sanctuary of Argos, it seemed to him that the oracle of the god had\r\nhad its fulfilment for him; therefore he did not think it right to make\r\nan attempt on the city, at least until he should have had recourse to\r\nsacrifice, and should have learnt whether the deity 69 permitted him or\r\nwhether she stood opposed to him: and as he was sacrificing for augury\r\n70 in the temple of Hera, a flame of fire blazed forth from the breasts\r\nof the image; and thus he knew the certainty of the matter, namely that\r\nhe would not conquer Argos: for if fire had blazed forth from the head\r\nof the image, he would have been conqueror of the city from top to\r\nbottom, 71 but since it blazed from the breasts, everything had been\r\naccomplished for him which the god desired should come to pass. Thus\r\nspeaking he seemed to the Spartans to speak credibly and reasonably, and\r\nhe easily escaped his pursuers. 72\r\n\r\n83. Argos however was so bereft of men that their slaves took possession\r\nof all the State, ruling and managing it until the sons of those who had\r\nperished grew to be men. Then these, endeavouring to gain Argos back\r\nto themselves, cast them out; and the slaves being driven forth gained\r\npossession of Tiryns by fighting. Now for a time these two parties had\r\nfriendly relations with one another; but afterwards there came to the\r\nslaves a prophet named Cleander, by race a Phigalian from Arcadia: this\r\nman persuaded the slaves to attack their masters, and in consequence\r\nof this there was war between them for a long time, until at last with\r\ndifficulty the Argives overcame them.\r\n\r\n84. The Argives then say that this was the reason why Cleomenes went mad\r\nand had an evil end: but the Spartans themselves say that Cleomenes was\r\nnot driven mad by any divine power, but that he had become a drinker of\r\nunmixed wine from having associated with Scythians, and that he went mad\r\nin consequence of this: for the nomad Scythians, they say, when Dareios\r\nhad made invasion of their land, desired eagerly after this to take\r\nvengeance upon him; and they sent to Sparta and tried to make an\r\nalliance, and to arrange that while the Scythians themselves attempted\r\nan invasion of Media by the way of the river Phasis, the Spartans should\r\nset forth from Ephesos and go up inland, and then that they should meet\r\nin one place: and they say that Cleomenes when the Scythians had\r\ncome for this purpose, associated with them largely, and that thus\r\nassociating more than was fit, he learnt the practice of drinking wine\r\nunmixed with water; and for this cause (as the Spartans think) he went\r\nmad. Thenceforth, as they say themselves, when they desire to drink\r\nstronger wine, they say \"Fill up in Scythian fashion.\" 73 Thus the\r\nSpartans report about Cleomenes; but to me it seems that this was a\r\nretribution which Cleomenes paid for Demaratos.\r\n\r\n85. Now when the Eginetans heard that Cleomenes had met his end, they\r\nsent messengers to Sparta to denounce Leotychides for the matter of the\r\nhostages which were being kept at Athens: and the Lacedemonians caused\r\na court to assemble and judged that the Eginetans had been dealt with\r\noutrageously by Leotychides; and they condemned him to be taken to Egina\r\nand delivered up in place of the men who were being kept at Athens. Then\r\nwhen the Eginetans were about to take Leotychides, Theasides the son\r\nof Leoprepes, a man of repute in Sparta, said to them: \"What are ye\r\nproposing 74 to do, men of Egina? Do ye mean to take away the king of\r\nthe Spartans, thus delivered up to you by his fellow-citizens? If the\r\nSpartans now being in anger have decided so, beware lest at some future\r\ntime, if ye do this, they bring an evil upon your land which may destroy\r\nit.\" Hearing this the Eginetans abstained from taking him; but they came\r\nto an agreement that Leotychides should accompany them to Athens and\r\nrestore the men to the Eginetans.\r\n\r\n86. When however Leotychides came to Athens and asked for the deposit\r\nback, the Athenians, not being willing to give up the hostages, produced\r\npretexts for refusing, and alleged that two kings had deposited them\r\nand they did not think it right to give them back to the one without the\r\nother: so since the Athenians said that they would not give them back,\r\nLeotychides spoke to them as follows:\r\n\r\n(a) \"Athenians, do whichever thing ye yourselves desire; for ye know\r\nthat if ye give them up, ye do that which religion commands, and if ye\r\nrefuse to give them up, ye do the opposite of this: but I desire to tell\r\nyou what kind of a thing came to pass once in Sparta about a deposit. We\r\nSpartans report that there was in Lacedemon about two generations before\r\nmy time on Glaucos the son of Epikydes. This man we say attained the\r\nhighest merit in all things besides, and especially he was well reported\r\nof by all who at that time dwelt in Lacedemon for his uprightness: and\r\nwe relate that in due time 75 it happened to him thus:--a man of Miletos\r\ncame to Sparta and desired to have speech with him, alleging the reasons\r\nwhich follow: 'I am a Milesian,' he said, 'and I am come hither desiring\r\nto have benefit from thy uprightness, Glaucos; for as there was much\r\nreport of thy uprightness throughout all the rest of Hellas and also in\r\nIonia, I considered with myself that Ionia is ever in danger, whereas\r\nPeloponnesus is safely established, and also that we never see wealth\r\ncontinue in the possession of the same persons long;--reflecting, I say,\r\non these things and taking counsel with myself, I resolved to turn into\r\nmoney the half of my possessions, and to place it with thee, being well\r\nassured that if it were placed with thee I should have it safe. Do\r\nthou therefore, I pray thee, receive the money, and take and keep these\r\ntallies; and whosoever shall ask for the money back having the tokens\r\nanswering to these, to him do thou restore it.' (b) The stranger who had\r\ncome from Miletos said so much; and Glaucos accepted the deposit on the\r\nterms proposed. Then after a long time had gone by, there came to Sparta\r\nthe sons of him who had deposited the money with Glaucos; and they came\r\nto speech with Glaucos, and producing the tokens asked for the money to\r\nbe given back: but he repulsed them answering them again thus: 'I do not\r\nremember the matter, nor does my mind bring back to me any knowledge of\r\nthose things whereof ye speak; but I desire to recollect and do all that\r\nis just; for if I received it, I desire to restore it honestly; and if\r\non the other hand I did not receive it at all, I will act towards you\r\nin accordance with the customs of the Hellenes: 76 therefore I defer\r\nthe settling of the matter with you for three months from now.' (c) The\r\nMilesians accordingly went away grieved, for they supposed that they had\r\nbeen robbed of the money; but Glaucos set forth to Delphi to consult the\r\nOracle: and when he inquired of the Oracle whether he should rob them\r\nof the money by an oath, the Pythian prophetess rebuked him with these\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"'Glaucos, thou, Epikydes' son, yea, this for the moment,\r\n   This, to conquer their word by an oath and to rob, is more gainful.\r\n   Swear, since the lot of death waits also for him who swears truly.\r\n   But know thou that Oath has a son, one nameless and handless and\r\n   footless, Yet without feet he pursues, without hands he seizes, and\r\n   wholly He shall destroy the race and the house of the man who offendeth.\r\n   But for the man who swears truly his race is the better hereafter.'\r\n\r\nHaving heard this Glaucos entreated that the god would pardon him for\r\nthat which he had said, but the prophetess said that to make trial of\r\nthe god and to do the deed were things equivalent. (d) Glaucos then,\r\nhaving sent for the Milesians, gave back to them the money: but the\r\nreason for which, O Athenians, I set forth to relate to you this story,\r\nshall now be told. At the present time there is no descendant of Glaucos\r\nexisting, nor any hearth which is esteemed to be that of Glaucos, but he\r\nhas been utterly destroyed and rooted up out of Sparta. Thus it is\r\ngood not even to entertain a thought about a deposit other than that of\r\nrestoring it, when they who made it ask for it again.\"\r\n\r\n87. When Leotychides had thus spoken, since not even so were the\r\nAthenians willing to listen to him, he departed back; and the Eginetans,\r\nbefore paying the penalty for their former wrongs wherein they\r\ndid outrage to the Athenians to please the Thebans, 77 acted as\r\nfollows:--complaining of the conduct of the Athenians and thinking that\r\nthey were being wronged, they made preparations to avenge themselves\r\nupon the Athenians; and since the Athenians were celebrating a\r\nfour-yearly festival 78 at Sunion, they lay in wait for the sacred ship\r\nwhich was sent to it and took it, the vessel being full of men who were\r\nthe first among the Athenians; and having taken it they laid the men in\r\nbonds..\r\n\r\n88. The Athenians after they had suffered this wrong from the Eginetans\r\nno longer delayed to contrive all things possible to their hurt.\r\nAnd there was 79 in Egina a man of repute, one Nicodromos the son of\r\nCnithos: 80 this man had cause of complaint against the Eginetans for\r\nhaving before this driven him forth out of the island; and hearing now\r\nthat the Athenians had resolved to do mischief to the Eginetans, he\r\nagreed with the Athenians to deliver up Egina to them, telling them on\r\nwhat day he would make his attempt and by what day it would be necessary\r\nfor them to come to his assistance..\r\n\r\n89. After this Nicodromos, according as he had agreed with the\r\nAthenians, seized that which is called the old city, but the Athenians\r\ndid not come to his support at the proper time; for, as it chanced, they\r\nhad not ships sufficient to fight with the Eginetans; so while they were\r\nasking the Corinthians to lend them ships, during this time their cause\r\nwent to ruin. The Corinthians however, being at this time exceedingly\r\nfriendly with them, gave the Athenians twenty ships at their request;\r\nand these they gave by selling them at five drachmas apiece, for by the\r\nlaw it was not permitted to give them as a free gift. Having taken these\r\nships of which I speak and also their own, the Athenians with seventy\r\nships manned in all sailed to Egina, and they were later by one day than\r\nthe time agreed..\r\n\r\n90. Nicodromos meanwhile, as the Athenians did not come to his support\r\nat the proper time, embarked in a ship and escaped from Egina, and\r\nwith him also went others of the Eginetans; and the Athenians gave them\r\nSunion to dwell in, starting from whence these men continued to plunder\r\nthe Eginetans who were in the island..\r\n\r\n91. This happened afterwards: but at the time of which we speak the\r\nwell-to-do class among the Eginetans prevailed over the men of the\r\npeople, who had risen against them in combination with Nicodromos, and\r\nthen having got them into their power they were bringing their prisoners\r\nforth to execution. From this there came upon them a curse which they\r\nwere not able to expiate by sacrifice, though they devised against it\r\nall they could; but they were driven forth from the island before the\r\ngoddess became propitious to them. For they had taken as prisoners\r\nseven hundred of the men of the people and were bringing them forth to\r\nexecution, when one of them escaped from his bonds and fled for refuge\r\nto the entrance of the temple of Demeter the Giver of Laws, 81 and he\r\ntook hold of the latch of the door and clung to it; and when they found\r\nthat they could not drag him from it by pulling him away, they cut off\r\nhis hands and so carried him off, and those hands remained clinging to\r\nthe latch of the door..\r\n\r\n92. Thus did the Eginetans to one another: and when the Athenians came,\r\nthey fought against them with seventy ships, and being worsted in\r\nthe sea-fight they called to their assistance the same whom they had\r\nsummoned before, namely the Argives. These would no longer come to their\r\nhelp, having cause of complaint because the ships of Egina compelled\r\nby Cleomenes had put in to the land of Argos and their crews had landed\r\nwith the Lacedemonians; with whom also had landed men from ships of\r\nSikyon in this same invasion: and as a penalty for this there was laid\r\nupon them by the Argives a fine of a thousand talents, five hundred\r\nfor each State. The Sikyonians accordingly, acknowledging that they had\r\ncommitted a wrong, had made an agreement to pay a hundred talents and be\r\nfree from the penalty; the Eginetans however did not acknowledge their\r\nwrong, but were more stubborn. For this reason then, when they made\r\nrequest, none of the Argives now came to their help at the charge of the\r\nState, but volunteers came to the number of a thousand; and their\r\nleader was a commander named Eurybates, a man who had practised the five\r\ncontests. 82 Of these men the greater number never returned back,\r\nbut were slain by the Athenians in Egina; and the commander himself,\r\nEurybates, fighting in single combat 83 killed in this manner three men\r\nand was himself slain by the fourth, Sophanes namely of Dekeleia.\r\n\r\n93. The Eginetans however engaged in contest with the Athenians in\r\nships, when these were in disorder, and defeated them; and they took of\r\nthem four ships together with their crews.\r\n\r\n94. So the Athenians were at war with the Eginetans; and meanwhile the\r\nPersian was carrying forward his design, since he was put in mind ever\r\nby his servant to remember the Athenians, and also because of the\r\nsons of Peisistratos were near at hand and brought charges continually\r\nagainst the Athenians, while at the same time Dareios himself wished to\r\ntake hold of this pretext and subdue those nations of Hellas which\r\nhad not given him earth and water. Mardonios then, since he had fared\r\nmiserably in his expedition, he removed from his command; and appointing\r\nother generals to command he despatched them against Eretria and\r\nAthens, namely Datis, who was a Mede by race, and Artaphrenes the son\r\nof Artaphrenes, a nephew of the king: and he sent them forth with the\r\ncharge to reduce Athens and Eretria to slavery and to bring the slaves\r\nback into his presence..\r\n\r\n95. When these who had been appointed to command came in their march\r\nfrom the king to the Aleïan plain in Kilikia, taking with them a large\r\nand well-equipped land-army, then while they were encamping there,\r\nthe whole naval armament came up, which had been appointed for several\r\nnations to furnish; and there came to them also the ships for carrying\r\nhorses, which in the year before Dareios had ordered his tributaries to\r\nmake ready. In these they placed their horses, and having embarked the\r\nland-army in the ships they sailed for Ionia with six hundred triremes.\r\nAfter this they did not keep their ships coasting along the mainland\r\ntowards the Hellespont and Thrace, but they started from Samos and made\r\ntheir voyage by the Icarian Sea 84 and between the islands; because, as\r\nI think, they feared more than all else the voyage round Athos, seeing\r\nthat in the former year 85 while making the passage by this way they had\r\ncome to great disaster. Moreover also Naxos compelled them, since it had\r\nnot been conquered at the former time. 86.\r\n\r\n96. And when they had arrived at Naxos, coming against it from the\r\nIcarian Sea (for it was against Naxos first that the Persians intended\r\nto make expedition, remembering the former events), the Naxians departed\r\nforthwith fleeing to the mountains, and did not await their attack; but\r\nthe Persians made slaves of those of them whom they caught and set fire\r\nto both the temples and the town. Having so done they put out to sea to\r\nattack the other islands.\r\n\r\n97. While these were doing thus, the Delians also had left Delos and\r\nfled away to Tenos; and when the armament was sailing in thither, Datis\r\nsailed on before and did not allow the ships to anchor at the island of\r\nDelos, but at Rhenaia on the other side of the channel; and he himself,\r\nhaving found out by inquiry where the men of Delos were, sent a herald\r\nand addressed them thus: \"Holy men, why are ye fled away and departed,\r\nhaving judged of me that which is not convenient? for even I of myself\r\nhave wisdom at least so far, and moreover it has been thus commanded me\r\nby the king, not to harm at all that land in which the two divinities\r\nwere born, neither the land itself nor the inhabitants of it. Now\r\ntherefore return to your own possessions and dwell in your island.\" Thus\r\nhe proclaimed by a herald to the Delians; and after this he piled up and\r\nburned upon the altar three hundred talents' weight of frankincense.\r\n\r\n98. Datis having done these things sailed away with his army to fight\r\nagainst Eretria first, taking with him both Ionians and Aiolians; and\r\nafter he had put out to sea from thence, Delos was moved, not having\r\nbeen shaken (as the Delians reported to me) either before that time\r\nor since that down to my own time; and this no doubt the god 8601\r\nmanifested as a portent to men of the evils that were about to be;\r\nfor in the time of Dareios the son of Hystaspes and Xerxes the son of\r\nDareios and Artoxerxes the son of Xerxes, three generations following\r\nupon one another, there happened more evils to Hellas than during the\r\ntwenty other generations which came before Dareios, some of the evils\r\ncoming to it from the Persians, and others from the leaders themselves\r\nof Hellas warring together for supremacy. Thus it was not unreasonable\r\nthat Delos should be moved, which was before unmoved. [And in an oracle\r\nit was thus written about it: 87\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Delos too will I move, unmoved though it hath been aforetime.\"]\r\n\r\nNow in the Hellenic tongue the names which have been mentioned have this\r\nmeaning--Dareios means \"compeller,\" 88 Xerxes \"warrior,\" 89 Artoxerxes\r\n\"great warrior.\" 90 Thus then might the Hellenes rightly call these\r\nkings in their own tongue.\r\n\r\n99. The Barbarians then, when they had departed from Delos, touched at\r\nthe islands as they went, and from them received additional forces and\r\ntook sons of the islanders as hostages: and when in sailing round about\r\nthe islands they put in also to Carystos, seeing that the Carystians\r\nwould neither give them hostages nor consent to join in an expedition\r\nagainst cities that were their neighbours, meaning Eretria and Athens,\r\nthey began to besiege them and to ravage their land; until at last the\r\nCarystians also came over to the will of the Persians..\r\n\r\n100. The Eretrians meanwhile being informed that the armament of the\r\nPersians was sailing to attack them, requested the Athenians to help\r\nthem; and the Athenians did not refuse their support, but gave as\r\nhelpers those four thousand to whom had been allotted the land of the\r\nwealthy 91 Chalkidians. The Eretrians however, as it turned out, had no\r\nsound plan of action, for while they sent for the Athenians, they had\r\nin their minds two different designs: some of them, that is, proposed\r\nto leave the city and go to the heights of Euboea; while others of them,\r\nexpecting to win gain for themselves from the Persian, were preparing to\r\nsurrender the place. Having got knowledge of how things were as regards\r\nboth these plans, Aischines the son of Nothon, one of the leaders of\r\nthe Eretrians, told the whole condition of their affairs to those of the\r\nAthenians who had come, and entreated them to depart and go to their own\r\nland, that they might not also perish. So the Athenians did according to\r\nthis counsel given to them by Aischines..\r\n\r\n101. And while these passed over to Oropos and saved themselves, the\r\nPersians sailed on and brought their ships to land about Temenos\r\nand Chioreai and Aigilea in the Eretrian territory; and having taken\r\npossession of these places, 9101 forthwith they began to disembark their\r\nhorses and prepared to advance against the enemy. The Eretrians however\r\ndid not intend to come forth against them and fight; but their endeavour\r\nwas if possible to hold out by defending their walls, since the counsel\r\nprevailed not to leave the city. Then a violent assault was made upon\r\nthe wall, and for six days there fell many on both sides; but on the\r\nseventh day Euphorbos the son of Alkimachos and Philagros the son\r\nof Kyneos, men of repute among the citizens, gave up the city to the\r\nPersians. These having entered the city plundered and set fire to the\r\ntemples in retribution for the temples which were burned at Sardis, and\r\nalso reduced the people to slavery according to the commands of Dareios.\r\n\r\n102. Having got Eretria into their power, they stayed a few days and\r\nthen sailed for the land of Attica, pressing on 92 hard and supposing\r\nthat the Athenians would do the same as the Eretrians had done. And\r\nsince Marathon was the most convenient place in Attica for horsemen\r\nto act and was also very near to Eretria, therefore Hippias the son of\r\nPeisistratos was guiding them thither..\r\n\r\n103. When the Athenians had information of this, they too went to\r\nMarathon to the rescue of their land; and they were led by ten generals,\r\nof whom the tenth was Miltiades, whose father Kimon of Stesagoras had\r\nbeen compelled to go into exile from Athens because of Peisistratos the\r\nson of Hippocrates: and while he was in exile it was his fortune to win\r\na victory at the Olympic games with a four-horse chariot, wherein, as\r\nit happened, he did the same thing as his half-brother Miltiades 93\r\nhad done, who had the same mother as he. Then afterwards in the next\r\nsucceeding Olympic games he gained a victory with the same mares and\r\nallowed Peisistratos to be proclaimed as victor; and having resigned to\r\nhim the victory he returned to his own native land under an agreement\r\nfor peace. Then after he had won with the same mares at another Olympic\r\nfestival, it was his hap to be slain by the sons of Peisistratos,\r\nPeisistratos himself being no longer alive. These killed him near the\r\nCity Hall, having set men to lie in wait for him by night; and the\r\nburial-place of Kimon is in the outskirts of the city, on the other side\r\nof the road which is called the way through Coile, and just opposite him\r\nthose mares are buried which won in three Olympic games. This same\r\nthing was done also by the mares belonging to Euagoras the Laconian,\r\nbut besides these by none others. Now the elder of the sons of Kimon,\r\nStesagoras, was at that time being brought up in the house of his\r\nfather's brother Miltiades in the Chersonese, while the younger son\r\nwas being brought up at Athens with Kimon himself, having been named\r\nMiltiades after Miltiades the settler of the Chersonese..\r\n\r\n104. This Miltiades then at the time of which we speak had come from the\r\nChersonese and was a general of the Athenians, after escaping death in\r\ntwo forms; for not only did the Phenicians, who had pursued after him as\r\nfar as Imbros, endeavour earnestly to take him and bring him up to the\r\npresence of the king, but also after this, when he had escaped from\r\nthese and had come to his own native land and seemed to be in safety\r\nfrom that time forth, his opponents, who had laid wait for him there,\r\nbrought him up before a court and prosecuted him for his despotism in\r\nthe Chersonese. Having escaped these also, he had then been appointed a\r\ngeneral of the Athenians, being elected by the people.\r\n\r\n105. First of all, while they were still in the city, the generals sent\r\noff to Sparta a herald, namely Pheidippides 94 an Athenian and for the\r\nrest a runner of long day-courses and one who practised this as his\r\nprofession. With this man, as Pheidippides himself said and as he made\r\nreport to the Athenians, Pan chanced to meet by mount Parthenion, which\r\nis above Tegea; and calling aloud the name of Pheidippides, Pan bade him\r\nreport to the Athenians and ask for what reason they had no care of him,\r\nthough he was well disposed to the Athenians and had been serviceable to\r\nthem on many occasions before that time, and would be so also yet again.\r\nBelieving that this tale was true, the Athenians, when their affairs had\r\nbeen now prosperously settled, established under the Acropolis a temple\r\nof Pan; and in consequence of this message they propitiate him with\r\nsacrifice offered every year and with a torch-race..\r\n\r\n106. However at that time, the time namely when he said that Pan\r\nappeared to him, this Pheidippides having been sent by the generals was\r\nin Sparta on the next day after that on which he left the city of\r\nthe Athenians; and when he had come to the magistrates he said:\r\n\"Lacedemonians, the Athenians make request of you to come to their help\r\nand not to allow a city most anciently established among the Hellenes to\r\nfall into slavery by the means of Barbarians; for even now Eretria has\r\nbeen enslaved, and Hellas has become the weaker by a city of renown.\"\r\nHe, as I say, reported to them that with which he had been charged,\r\nand it pleased them well to come to help the Athenians; but it was\r\nimpossible for them to do so at once, since they did not desire to break\r\ntheir law; for it was the ninth day of the month, and on the ninth day\r\nthey said they would not go forth, nor until the circle of the moon\r\nshould be full. 95\r\n\r\n107. These men were waiting for the full moon: and meanwhile Hippias\r\nthe son of Peisistratos was guiding the Barbarians in to Marathon, after\r\nhaving seen on the night that was just past a vision in his sleep of\r\nthis kind,--it seemed to Hippias that he lay with his own mother. He\r\nconjectured then from the dream that he should return to Athens and\r\nrecover his rule, and then bring his life to an end in old age in his\r\nown land. From the dream, I say, he conjectured this; and after this, as\r\nhe guided them in, first he disembarked the slaves from Eretria on the\r\nisland belonging to the Styrians, called Aigleia; 96 and then, as the\r\nships came in to shore at Marathon, he moored them there, and after\r\nthe Barbarians had come from their ships to land, he was engaged in\r\ndisposing them in their places. While he was ordering these things, it\r\ncame upon him to sneeze and cough more violently than was his wont. Then\r\nsince he was advanced in years, most of his teeth were shaken thereby,\r\nand one of these teeth he cast forth by the violence of the cough: 97\r\nand the tooth having fallen from him upon the sand, he was very\r\ndesirous to find it; since however the tooth was not to be found when he\r\nsearched, he groaned aloud and said to those who were by him: \"This land\r\nis not ours, nor shall we be able to make it subject to us; but so much\r\npart in it as belonged to me the tooth possesses.\"\r\n\r\n108. Hippias then conjectured that his vision had been thus fulfilled:\r\nand meanwhile, after the Athenians had been drawn up in the sacred\r\nenclosure of Heracles, there joined them the Plataians coming to their\r\nhelp in a body: for the Plataians had given themselves to the Athenians,\r\nand the Athenians before this time undertook many toils on behalf of\r\nthem; and this was the manner in which they gave themselves:--Being\r\noppressed by the Thebans, the Plataians at first desired to\r\ngive themselves to Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides and to the\r\nLacedemonians, who chanced to come thither; but these did not accept\r\nthem, and said to them as follows: \"We dwell too far off, and such\r\nsupport as ours would be to you but cold comfort; for ye might many\r\ntimes be reduced to slavery before any of us had information of it: but\r\nwe counsel you rather to give yourselves to the Athenians, who are both\r\nneighbours and also not bad helpers.\" Thus the Lacedemonians counselled,\r\nnot so much on account of their goodwill to the Plataians as because\r\nthey desired that the Athenians should have trouble by being involved in\r\na conflict with the Boetians. The Lacedemonians, I say, thus counselled\r\nthe men of Plataia; and they did not fail to follow their counsel, but\r\nwhen the Athenians were doing sacrifice to the twelve gods, they sat\r\ndown as suppliants at the altar and so gave themselves. Then the Thebans\r\nhaving been informed of these things marched against the Plataians, and\r\nthe Athenians came to their assistance: and as they were about to join\r\nbattle, the Corinthians did not permit them to do so, but being by\r\nchance there, they reconciled their strife; and both parties having put\r\nthe matter into their hands, they laid down boundaries for the land,\r\nwith the condition that the Thebans should leave those of the Boeotians\r\nalone who did not desire to be reckoned with the other Boeotians. The\r\nCorinthians having given this decision departed; but as the Athenians\r\nwere going back, the Boeotians attacked them, and having attacked them\r\nthey were worsted in the fight. Upon that the Athenians passed beyond\r\nthe boundaries which the Corinthians had set to be for the Plataians,\r\nand they made the river Asopos itself to be the boundary of the Thebans\r\ntowards the land of Plataia and towards the district of Hysiai. The\r\nPlataians then had given themselves to the Athenians in the manner which\r\nhas been said, and at this time they came to Marathon to bring them\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n109. Now the opinions of the generals of the Athenians were divided,\r\nand the one party urged that they should not fight a battle, seeing that\r\nthey were too few to fight with the army of the Medes, while the others,\r\nand among them Miltiades, advised that they should do so: and when they\r\nwere divided and the worse opinion was like to prevail, then, since he\r\nwho had been chosen by lot 98 to be polemarch of the Athenians had a\r\nvote in addition to the ten (for in old times the Athenians gave\r\nthe polemarch an equal vote with the generals) and at that time the\r\npolemarch was Callimachos of the deme of Aphidnai, to him came Miltiades\r\nand said as follows: \"With thee now it rests, Callimachos, either to\r\nbring Athens under slavery, or by making her free to leave behind\r\nthee for all the time that men shall live a memorial such as not even\r\nHarmodios and Aristogeiton have left. For now the Athenians have come\r\nto a danger the greatest to which they have ever come since they were\r\na people; and on the one hand, if they submit to the Medes, it is\r\ndetermined what they shall suffer, being delivered over to Hippias,\r\nwhile on the other hand, if this city shall gain the victory, it may\r\nbecome the first of the cities of Hellas. How this may happen and how it\r\ncomes to thee of all men 99 to have the decision of these matters, I\r\nam now about to tell. Of us the generals, who are ten in number, the\r\nopinions are divided, the one party urging that we fight a battle and\r\nthe others that we do not fight. Now if we do not, I expect that some\r\ngreat spirit of discord will fall upon the minds of the Athenians and\r\nso shake them that they shall go over to the Medes; but if we fight a\r\nbattle before any unsoundness appear in any part of the Athenian people,\r\nthen we are able to gain the victory in the fight, if the gods grant\r\nequal conditions. These things then all belong to thee and depend\r\non thee; for if thou attach thyself to my opinions, thou hast both a\r\nfatherland which is free and a native city which shall be the first\r\namong the cities of Hellas; but if thou choose the opinion of those who\r\nare earnest against fighting, thou shalt have the opposite of those good\r\nthings of which I told thee.\".\r\n\r\n110. Thus speaking Miltiades gained Callimachos to his side; and the\r\nopinion of the polemarch being added, it was thus determined to fight\r\na battle. After this, those generals whose opinion was in favour of\r\nfighting, as the turn of each one of them to command for the day 100\r\ncame round, gave over their command to Miltiades; and he, accepting\r\nit, would not however yet bring about a battle, until his own turn to\r\ncommand had come..\r\n\r\n111. And when it came round to him, then the Athenians were drawn up for\r\nbattle in the order which here follows:--On the right wing the polemarch\r\nCallimachos was leader (for the custom of the Athenians then was this,\r\nthat the polemarch should have the right wing); and he leading, next\r\nafter him came the tribes in order as they were numbered one after\r\nanother, and last were drawn up the Plataians occupying the left wing:\r\nfor 101 ever since this battle, when the Athenians offer sacrifices in\r\nthe solemn assemblies 102 which are made at the four-yearly festivals,\r\n103 the herald of the Athenians prays thus, \"that blessings 104 may come\r\nto the Athenians and to the Plataians both.\" On this occasion however,\r\nwhen the Athenians were being drawn up at Marathon something of this\r\nkind was done:--their army being made equal in length of front to that\r\nof the Medes, came to drawn up in the middle with a depth of but few\r\nranks, and here their army was weakest, while each wing was strengthened\r\nwith numbers..\r\n\r\n112. And when they had been arranged in their places and the sacrifices\r\nproved favourable, then the Athenians were let go, and they set forth at\r\na run to attack the Barbarians. Now the space between the armies was not\r\nless than eight furlongs: 105 and the Persians seeing them advancing\r\nto the attack at a run, made preparations to receive them; and in their\r\nminds they charged the Athenians with madness which must be fatal,\r\nseeing that they were few and yet were pressing forwards at a run,\r\nhaving neither cavalry nor archers. 106 Such was the thought of the\r\nBarbarians; but the Athenians when all in a body they had joined in\r\ncombat with the Barbarians, fought in a memorable fashion: for they were\r\nthe first of all the Hellenes about whom we know who went to attack the\r\nenemy at a run, and they were the first also who endured to face the\r\nMedian garments and the men who wore them, whereas up to this time the\r\nvery name of the Medes was to the Hellenes a terror to hear..\r\n\r\n113. Now while they fought in Marathon, much time passed by; and in the\r\ncentre of the army, where the Persians themselves and the Sacans were\r\ndrawn up, the Barbarians were winning,--here, I say, the Barbarians had\r\nbroken the ranks of their opponents and were pursuing them inland, but\r\non both wings the Athenians and the Plataians severally were winning\r\nthe victory; and being victorious they left that part of the Barbarians\r\nwhich had been routed to fly without molestation, and bringing together\r\nthe two wings they fought with those who had broken their centre, and\r\nthe Athenians were victorious. So they followed after the Persians as\r\nthey fled, slaughtering them, until they came to the sea; and then they\r\ncalled for fire and began to take hold of the ships..\r\n\r\n114. In this part of the work was slain the polemarch Callimachos\r\nafter having proved himself a good man, and also one of the generals,\r\nStesilaos the son of Thrasylaos, was killed; and besides this Kynegeiros\r\nthe son of Euphorion while taking hold 107 there of the ornament at\r\nthe stern of a ship had his hand cut off with an axe and fell; and many\r\nothers also of the Athenians who were men of note were killed..\r\n\r\n115. Seven of the ships the Athenians got possession of in this manner,\r\nbut with the rest the Barbarians pushed off from land, and after taking\r\nthe captives from Eretria off the island where they had left them,\r\nthey sailed round Sunion, purposing to arrive at the city before the\r\nAthenians. And an accusation became current among the Athenians to the\r\neffect that they formed this design by contrivance of the Alcmaionidai;\r\nfor these, it was said, having concerted matters with the Persians,\r\ndisplayed to them a shield when they had now embarked in their ships..\r\n\r\n116. These then, I say, were sailing round Sunion; and meanwhile the\r\nAthenians came to the rescue back to the city as speedily as they could,\r\nand they arrived there before the Barbarians came; and having arrived\r\nfrom the temple of Heracles at Marathon they encamped at another temple\r\nof Heracles, namely that which is in Kynosarges. The Barbarians however\r\ncame and lay with their ships in the sea which is off Phaleron, (for\r\nthis was then the seaport of the Athenians), they anchored their ships,\r\nI say, off this place, and then proceeded to sail back to Asia.\r\n\r\n117. In this fight at Marathon there were slain of the Barbarians about\r\nsix thousand four hundred men, and of the Athenians a hundred and ninety\r\nand two. Such was the number which fell on both sides; and it happened\r\nalso that a marvel occurred there of this kind:--an Athenian, Epizelos\r\nthe son of Cuphagoras, while fighting in the close combat and proving\r\nhimself a good man, was deprived of the sight of his eyes, neither\r\nhaving received a blow in any part of his body nor having been hit with\r\na missile, and for the rest of his life from this time he continued to\r\nbe blind: and I was informed that he used to tell about that which had\r\nhappened to him a tale of this kind, namely that it seemed to him that a\r\ntall man in full armour stood against him, whose beard overshadowed his\r\nwhole shield; and this apparition passed him by, but killed his comrade\r\nwho stood next to him. Thus, as I was informed, Epizelos told the tale.\r\n\r\n118. Datis, however, as he was going with his army to Asia, when he had\r\ncome to Myconos saw a vision in his sleep; and of what nature the vision\r\nwas it is not reported, but as soon as day dawned he caused a search to\r\nbe made of the ships, and finding in a Phenician ship an image of Apollo\r\noverlaid with gold, he inquired from whence it had been carried off.\r\nThen having been informed from what temple it came, he sailed in his\r\nown ship to Delos: and finding that the Delians had returned then to\r\nthe island, he deposited the image in the temple and charged the men of\r\nDelos to convey it back to Delion in the territory of the Thebans, which\r\nis situated by the sea-coast just opposite Chalkis. Datis having given\r\nthis charge sailed away: the Delians however did not convey the statue\r\nback, but after an interval of twenty years the Thebans themselves\r\nbrought it to Delion by reason of an oracle..\r\n\r\n119. Now as to those Eretrians who had been reduced to slavery, Datis\r\nand Artaphrenes, when they reached Asia in their voyage, brought them\r\nup to Susa; and king Dareios, though he had great anger against the\r\nEretrians before they were made captive, because the Eretrians had done\r\nwrong to him unprovoked, yet when he saw that they had been brought up\r\nto him and were in his power, he did them no more evil, but established\r\nthem as settlers in the Kissian land upon one of his own domains, of\r\nwhich the name is Ardericca: and this is distant two hundred and ten\r\nfurlongs from Susa and forty from the well which produces things of\r\nthree different kinds; for they draw from it asphalt, salt and oil, in\r\nthe manner which here follows:--the liquid is drawn with a swipe, to\r\nwhich there is fastened half a skin instead of a bucket, and a man\r\nstrikes this down into it and draws up, and then pours it into a\r\ncistern, from which it runs through into another vessel, taking three\r\nseparate ways. The asphalt and the salt become solid at once, and the\r\noil 108 which is called by the Persians rhadinake, is black and gives\r\nout a disagreeable smell. Here king Dareios established the Eretrians\r\nas settlers; and even to my time they continued to occupy this land,\r\nkeeping still their former language. Thus it happened with regard to the\r\nEretrians.\r\n\r\n120. Of the Lacedemonians there came to Athens two thousand after the\r\nfull moon, making great haste to be in time, so that they arrived in\r\nAttica on the third day after leaving Sparta: and though they had come\r\ntoo late for the battle, yet they desired to behold the Medes; and\r\naccordingly they went out to Marathon and looked at the bodies of the\r\nslain: then afterwards they departed home, commending the Athenians and\r\nthe work which they had done.\r\n\r\n121. Now it is a cause of wonder to me, and I do not accept the report,\r\nthat the Alcmaionidai could ever have displayed to the Persians a shield\r\nby a previous understanding, with the desire that the Athenians\r\nshould be under the Barbarians and under Hippias; seeing that they are\r\nevidently proved to have been haters of despots as much or more than\r\nCallias the son of Phainippos and father of Hipponicos, while Callias\r\nfor his part was the only man of all the Athenians who dared, when\r\nPeisistratos was driven out of Athens, to buy his goods offered for sale\r\nby the State, and in other ways also he contrived against him everything\r\nthat was most hostile:\r\n\r\n122. Of this Callias it is fitting that every one should have\r\nremembrance for many reasons: first because of that which has been\r\nbefore said, namely that he was a man of excellence in freeing his\r\ncountry; and then also for that which he did at the Olympic games,\r\nwherein he gained a victory in the horse-race and was second in the\r\nchariot-race, and he had before this been a victor at the Pythian games,\r\nso that he was distinguished in the sight of all Hellenes by the sums\r\nwhich he expended; and finally because he showed himself a man of such\r\nliberality towards his daughters, who were three in number; for\r\nwhen they came to be of ripe age for marriage, he gave them a most\r\nmagnificent dowry and also indulged their inclinations; for whomsoever\r\nof all the Athenians each one of them desired to choose as a husband for\r\nherself, to that man he gave her.] 109.\r\n\r\n123, and similarly, 110 the Alcmaionidai were haters of despots equally\r\nor more 111 than he. Therefore this is a cause of wonder to me, and I do\r\nnot admit the accusation that these they were who displayed the shield;\r\nseeing that they were in exile from the despots during their whole time,\r\nand that by their contrivance the sons of Peisistratos gave up their\r\nrule. Thus it follows that they were the men who set Athens free much\r\nmore than Harmodios and Aristogeiton, as I judge: for these my slaying\r\nHipparchos exasperated the rest of the family of Peisistratos, and\r\ndid not at all cause the others to cease from their despotism; but the\r\nAlcmaionidai did evidently set Athens free, at least if these were in\r\ntruth the men who persuaded the Pythian prophetess to signify to the\r\nLacedemonians that they should set Athens free, as I have set forth\r\nbefore..\r\n\r\n124. It may be said however that they had some cause of complaint\r\nagainst the people of the Athenians, and therefore endeavoured to betray\r\ntheir native city. But on the contrary there were no men in greater\r\nrepute than they, among the Athenians at least, nor who had been more\r\nhighly honoured. Thus it is not reasonable to suppose that by them a\r\nshield should have been displayed for any such purpose. A shield was\r\ndisplayed, however; that cannot be denied, for it was done: but as to\r\nwho it was who displayed it, I am not able to say more than this.\r\n\r\n125. Now the family of Alcmaionidai was distinguished in Athens in the\r\nearliest times also, and from the time of Alcmaion and of Megacles after\r\nhim they became very greatly distinguished. For first Alcmaion the son\r\nof Megacles showed himself a helper of the Lydians from Sardis who came\r\nfrom Croesus to the Oracle at Delphi, and assisted them with zeal; and\r\nCroesus having heard from the Lydians who went to the Oracle that\r\nthis man did him service, sent for him to Sardis; and when he came, he\r\noffered to give him a gift of as much gold as he could carry away at\r\nonce upon his own person. With a view to this gift, its nature being\r\nsuch, Alcmaion made preparations and used appliances as follows:--he put\r\non a large tunic leaving a deep fold in the tunic to hang down in front,\r\nand he draw on his feet the widest boots which he could find, and so\r\nwent to the treasury to which they conducted him. Then he fell upon a\r\nheap of gold-dust, and first he packed in by the side of his legs so\r\nmuch of the gold as his boots would contain, and then he filled the\r\nwhole fold of the tunic with the gold and sprinkled some of the gold\r\ndust on the hair of his head and took some into his mouth, and having so\r\ndone he came forth out of the treasury, with difficulty dragging along\r\nhis boots and resembling anything in the world rather than a man; for\r\nhis mouth was stuffed full, and every part of him was swelled out: and\r\nupon Croesus came laughter when he saw him, and he not only gave him all\r\nthat, but also presented him in addition with more not inferior in\r\nvalue to that. Thus this house became exceedingly wealthy, and thus the\r\nAlcmaion of whom I speak became a breeder of chariot-horses and won a\r\nvictory at Olympia..\r\n\r\n126. Then in the next generation after this, Cleisthenes the despot of\r\nSikyon exalted the family, so that it became of much more note among\r\nthe Hellenes than it had been formerly. For Cleisthenes the son of\r\nArisonymos, the son of Myron, the son of Andreas, had a daughter whose\r\nname was Agariste; and as to her he formed a desire to find out the best\r\nman of all the Hellenes and to assign her to him in marriage. So when\r\nthe Olympic games were being held and Cleisthenes was victor in them\r\nwith a four-horse chariot, he caused a proclamation to be made, that\r\nwhosoever of the Hellenes thought himself worthy to be the son-in-law of\r\nCleisthenes should come on the sixtieth day, or before that if he would,\r\nto Sikyon; for Cleisthenes intended to conclude the marriage within a\r\nyear, reckoning from the sixtieth day. Then all those of the Hellenes\r\nwho had pride either in themselves or in their high descent, 112 came\r\nas wooers, and for them Cleisthenes had a running-course and a\r\nwrestling-place made and kept them expressly for their use..\r\n\r\n127. From Italy came Smindyrides the son of Hippocrates of Sybaris, who\r\nof all men on earth reached the highest point of luxury (now Sybaris at\r\nthis time was in the height of its prosperity), and Damasos of Siris,\r\nthe son of that Amyris who was called the Wise; these came from Italy:\r\nfrom the Ionian gulf came Amphimnestos the son of Epistrophos of\r\nEpidamnos, this man from the Ionian gulf: from Aitolia came Males, the\r\nbrother of that Titormos who surpassed all the Hellenes in strength and\r\nwho fled from the presence of men to the furthest extremities of the\r\nAitolian land: from Peloponnesus, Leokedes the son of Pheidon the despot\r\nof the Argives, that Pheidon who established for the Peloponnesians\r\nthe measures which they use, and who went beyond all other Hellenes in\r\nwanton insolence, since he removed from their place the presidents of\r\nthe games appointed by the Eleians and himself presided over the\r\ngames at Olympia,--his son, I say, and Amiantos the son of Lycurgos an\r\nArcadian from Trapezus, and Laphanes an Azanian from the city of Paios,\r\nson of that Euphorion who (according to the story told in Arcadia)\r\nreceived the Dioscuroi as guests in his house and from thenceforth was\r\nwont to entertain all men who came, and Onomastos the son of Agaios\r\nof Elis; these, I say, came from Peloponnesus itself: from Athens came\r\nMegacles the son of that Alcmaion who went to Croesus, and besides him\r\nHippocleides the son of Tisander, one who surpassed the other Athenians\r\nin wealth and in comeliness of form: from Eretria, which at that time\r\nwas flourishing, came Lysanias, he alone from Euboea: from Thessalia\r\ncame Diactorides of Crannon, one of the family of the Scopadai: and from\r\nthe Molossians, Alcon..\r\n\r\n128. So many in number did the wooers prove to be: and when these had\r\ncome by the appointed day, Cleisthenes first inquired of their native\r\ncountries and of the descent of each one, and then keeping them for a\r\nyear he made trial continually both of their manly virtue and of\r\ntheir disposition, training and temper, associating both with each one\r\nseparately and with the whole number together: and he made trial of them\r\nboth by bringing out to bodily exercises those of them who were younger,\r\nand also especially in the common feast: for during all the time that he\r\nkept them he did everything that could be done, and at the same time he\r\nentertained them magnificently. Now it chanced that those of the wooers\r\npleased him most who had come from Athens, and of these Hippocleides the\r\nson of Tisander was rather preferred, both by reason of manly virtues\r\nand also because he was connected by descent with the family of Kypselos\r\nat Corinth.\r\n\r\n129. Then when the appointed day came for the marriage banquet and for\r\nCleisthenes himself to declare whom he selected from the whole number,\r\nCleisthenes sacrificed a hundred oxen and feasted both the wooers\r\nthemselves and all the people of Sikyon; and when the dinner was over,\r\nthe wooers began to vie with one another both in music and in speeches\r\nfor the entertainment of the company; 113 and as the drinking went\r\nforward and Hippocleides was very much holding the attention of the\r\nothers, 114 he bade the flute-player play for him a dance-measure;\r\nand when the flute-player did so, he danced: and it so befell that he\r\npleased himself in his dancing, but Cleisthenes looked on at the whole\r\nmatter with suspicion. Then Hippocleides after a certain time bade one\r\nbring in a table; and when the table came in, first he danced upon it\r\nLaconian figures, and then also Attic, and thirdly he planted his head\r\nupon the table and gesticulated with his legs. Cleisthenes meanwhile,\r\nwhen he was dancing the first and the second time, though he abhorred\r\nthe thought that Hippocleides should now become his son-in-law, because\r\nof his dancing and his shamelessness, yet restrained himself, not\r\ndesiring to break out in anger against him; but when he saw that he thus\r\ngesticulated with his legs, he was no longer able to restrain himself,\r\nbut said: \"Thou hast danced away thy marriage however, 115 son of\r\nTisander!\" and Hippocleides answered and said: \"Hippocleides cares not!\"\r\n\r\n130. and hence comes this saying. Then Cleisthenes caused silence to\r\nbe made, and spoke to the company as follows: \"Men who are wooers of my\r\ndaughter, I commend you all, and if it were possible I would gratify\r\nyou all, neither selecting one of you to be preferred, nor rejecting the\r\nremainder. Since however it is not possible, as I am deliberating about\r\none maiden only, to act so as to please all, therefore to those of you\r\nwho are rejected from this marriage I give as a gift a talent of silver\r\nto each one for the worthy estimation ye had of me, in that ye desired\r\nto marry from my house, and for the time of absence from your homes;\r\nand to the son of Alcmaion, Megacles, I offer my daughter Agariste in\r\nbetrothal according to the customs of the Athenians.\" Thereupon Megacles\r\nsaid that he accepted the betrothal, and so the marriage was determined\r\nby Cleisthenes.\r\n\r\n131. Thus it happened as regards the judgment of the wooers, and thus\r\nthe Alcmaionidai got renown over all Hellas. And these having been\r\nmarried, there was born to them that Cleisthenes who established the\r\ntribes and the democracy for the Athenians, he being called after the\r\nSikyonian Cleisthenes, his mother's father; this son, I say, was born to\r\nMegacles, and also Hippocrates: and of Hippocrates came another\r\nMegacles and another Agariste, called after Agariste, the daughter of\r\nCleisthenes, who having been married to Xanthippos the son of Ariphron\r\nand being with child, saw a vision in her sleep, and it seemed to her\r\nthat she had brought forth a lion: then after a few days she bore to\r\nXanthippos Pericles.\r\n\r\n132. After the defeat at Marathon, Miltiades, who even before was well\r\nreputed with the Athenians, came then to be in much higher estimation:\r\nand when he asked the Athenians for seventy ships and an army with\r\nsupplies of money, not declaring to them against what land he was\r\nintending to make an expedition, but saying that he would enrich them\r\ngreatly if they would go with him, for he would lead them to a land of\r\nsuch a kind that they would easily get from it gold in abundance,--thus\r\nsaying he asked for the ships; and the Athenians, elated by these words,\r\ndelivered them over to him..\r\n\r\n133. Then Miltiades, when he had received the army, proceeded to sail\r\nto Paris with the pretence that the Parians had first attacked Athens by\r\nmaking expedition with triremes to Marathon in company with the Persian:\r\nthis was the pretext which he put forward, but he had also a grudge\r\nagainst the Parians on account of Lysagoras the son of Tisias, who was\r\nby race of Paros, for having accused him to Hydarnes the Persian. So\r\nwhen Miltiades had arrived at the place to which he was sailing, he\r\nbegan to besiege the Parians with his army, first having shut them\r\nup within their wall; and sending in to them a herald he asked for a\r\nhundred talents, saying that if they refused to give them, his army\r\nshould not return back 116 until it had conquered them completely. The\r\nParians however had no design of giving any money to Miltiades, but\r\ncontrived only how they might defend their city, devising various things\r\nbesides and also this,--wherever at any time the wall proved to be open\r\nto attack, that point was raised when night came on to double its former\r\nheight..\r\n\r\n134. So much of the story is reported by all the Hellenes, but as to\r\nwhat followed the Parians alone report, and they say that it happened\r\nthus:--When Miltiades was at a loss, it is said, there came a woman to\r\nspeech with him, who had been taken prisoner, a Parian by race whose\r\nname was Timo, an under-priestess 117 of the Earth goddesses; 118 she,\r\nthey say, came into the presence of Miltiades and counselled him that if\r\nhe considered it a matter of much moment to conquer Paros, he could do\r\nthat which she should suggest to him; and upon that she told him her\r\nmeaning. He accordingly passed through to the hill which is before the\r\ncity and leapt over the fence of the temple of Demeter Giver of Laws,\r\n119 not being able to open the door; and then having leapt over he went\r\non towards the sanctuary 120 with the design of doing something within,\r\nwhether it were that he meant to lay hands on some of the things which\r\nshould not be touched, or whatever else he intended to do; and when he\r\nhad reached the door, forthwith a shuddering fear came over him and he\r\nset off to go back the same way as he came, and as he leapt down from\r\nthe wall of rough stones his thigh was dislocated, or, as others say, he\r\nstruck his knee against the wall..\r\n\r\n135. Miltiades accordingly, being in a wretched case, set forth to sail\r\nhomewards, neither bringing wealth to the Athenians nor having added\r\nto them the possession of Paros, but having besieged the city for\r\nsix-and-twenty days and laid waste the island: and the Parians being\r\ninformed that Timo the under-priestess of the goddesses had acted as\r\na guide to Miltiades, desired to take vengeance upon her for this, and\r\nthey sent messengers to Delphi to consult the god, so soon as they had\r\nleisure from the siege; and these messengers they sent to ask whether\r\nthey should put to death the under-priestess of the goddesses, who had\r\nbeen a guide to their enemies for the capture of her native city and had\r\nrevealed to Miltiades the mysteries which might not be uttered to a male\r\nperson. The Pythian prophetess however forbade them, saying that Timo\r\nwas not the true author of these things, but since it was destined that\r\nMiltiades should end his life not well, she had appeared to guide him to\r\nhis evil fate..\r\n\r\n136. Thus the Pythian prophetess replied to the Parians: and the\r\nAthenians, when Miltiades had returned back from Paros, began to talk of\r\nhim, and among the rest especially Xanthippos the son of Ariphron, who\r\nbrought Miltiades up before the people claiming the penalty of death and\r\nprosecuted him for his deception of the Athenians: and Miltiades did not\r\nhimself make his own defence, although he was present, for he was unable\r\nto do so because his thigh was mortifying; but he lay in public view\r\nupon a bed, while his friends made a defence for him, making mention\r\nmuch both of the battle which had been fought at Marathon and of\r\nthe conquest of Lemnos, namely how he had conquered Lemnos and taken\r\nvengeance on the Pelasgians, and had delivered it over to the Athenians:\r\nand the people came over to his part as regards the acquittal from the\r\npenalty of death, but they imposed a fine of fifty talents for the wrong\r\ncommitted: and after this Miltiades died, his thigh having gangrened and\r\nmortified, and the fifty talents were paid by his son Kimon.\r\n\r\n137. Now Miltiades son of Kimon had thus taken possession of the\r\nLemnos:--After the Pelasgians had been cast out of Attica by the\r\nAthenians, whether justly or unjustly,--for about this I cannot tell\r\nexcept the things reported, which are these:--Hecataois on the one hand,\r\nthe son of Hegesander, said in his history that it was done unjustly;\r\nfor he said that when the Athenians saw the land which extends below\r\nHymettos, which they had themselves given them 121 to dwell in, as\r\npayment for the wall built round the Acropolis in former times, when the\r\nAthenians, I say, saw that this land was made good by cultivation, which\r\nbefore was bad and worthless, they were seized with jealousy and with\r\nlonging to possess the land, and so drove them out, not alleging any\r\nother pretext: but according to the report of the Athenians themselves\r\nthey drove them out justly; for the Pelasgians being settled under\r\nHymettos made this a starting-point and committed wrong against them as\r\nfollows:--the daughters and sons of the Athenians were wont ever to go\r\nfor water to the spring of Enneacrunos; for at that time neither they\r\nnor the other Hellenes as yet had household servants; and when these\r\ngirls came, the Pelasgians in wantonness and contempt of the Athenians\r\nwould offer them violence; and it was not enough for them even to do\r\nthis, but at last they were found in the act of plotting an attack\r\nupon the city: and the narrators say that they herein proved themselves\r\nbetter men than the Pelasgians, inasmuch as when they might have slain\r\nthe Pelasgians, who had been caught plotting against them, they did not\r\nchoose to do so, but ordered them merely to depart out of the land: and\r\nthus having departed out of the land, the Pelasgians took possession of\r\nseveral older places and especially of Lemnos. The former story is that\r\nwhich was reported by Hecataios, while the latter is that which is told\r\nby the Athenians..\r\n\r\n138. These Pelasgians then, dwelling after that in Lemnos, desired to\r\ntake vengeance on the Athenians; and having full knowledge also of the\r\nfestivals of the Athenians, they got 122 fifty-oared galleys and laid\r\nwait for the women of the Athenians when they were keeping festival to\r\nArtemis in Brauron; and having carried off a number of them from thence,\r\nthey departed and sailed away home, and taking the women to Lemnos they\r\nkept them as concubines. Now when these women had children gradually\r\nmore and more, they made it their practice to teach their sons both\r\nthe Attic tongue and the manners of the Athenians. And these were not\r\nwilling to associate with the sons of the Pelasgian women, and moreover\r\nif any of them were struck by any one of those, they all in a body came\r\nto the rescue and helped one another. Moreover the boys claimed to\r\nhave authority over the other boys and got the better of them easily.\r\nPerceiving these things the Pelasgians considered the matter; and when\r\nthey took counsel together, a fear came over them and they thought, if\r\nthe boys were indeed resolved now to help one another against the sons\r\nof the legitimate wives, and were endeavouring already from the first to\r\nhave authority over them, what would they do when they were grown up to\r\nbe men? Then they determined to put to death the sons of the Athenian\r\nwomen, and this they actually did; and in addition to them they slew\r\ntheir mothers also. From this deed and from that which was done before\r\nthis, which the women did when they killed Thoas and the rest, who were\r\ntheir own husbands, it has become a custom in Hellas that all deeds of\r\ngreat cruelty should be called \"Lemnian deeds.\".\r\n\r\n139. After the Pelasgians had killed their own sons and wives, the earth\r\ndid not bear fruit for them, nor did their women or their cattle bring\r\nforth young as they did before; and being hard pressed by famine and by\r\nchildlessness, they sent to Delphi to ask for a release from the evils\r\nwhich were upon them; and the Pythian prophetess bade them pay such\r\npenalty to the Athenians as the Athenians themselves should appoint.\r\nThe Pelasgians came accordingly to Athens and professed that they were\r\nwilling to pay the penalty for all the wrong which they had done: and\r\nthe Athenians laid a couch in the fairest possible manner in the City\r\nHall, and having set by it a table covered with all good things, they\r\nbade the Pelasgians deliver up to them their land in that condition.\r\nThen the Pelasgians answered and said: \"When with a North Wind in one\r\nsingle day a ship shall accomplish the voyage from your land to ours,\r\nthen we will deliver it up,\" feeling assured that it was impossible for\r\nthis to happen, since Attica lies far away to the South of Lemnos..\r\n\r\n140. Such were the events which happened then: and very many years\r\nlater, after the Chersonese which is by the Hellespont had come to be\r\nunder the Athenians, Miltiades the son of Kimon, when the Etesian Winds\r\nblew steadily, accomplished the voyage in a ship from Elaius in the\r\nChersonese to Lemnos, and proclaimed to the Pelasgians that they should\r\ndepart out of the island, reminding them of the oracle, which the\r\nPelasgians had never expected would be accomplished for them. The men of\r\nHephaistia accordingly obeyed; but those of Myrina, not admitting that\r\nthe Chersonese was Attica, suffered a siege, until at last these also\r\nsubmitted. Thus it was that the Athenians and Miltiades took possession\r\nof Lemnos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO BOOK VI.\r\n\r\n1 [ {proboulous}.]\r\n\r\n2 [ See i. 148.]\r\n\r\n3 [ {epi keras}.]\r\n\r\n4 [ {diekploon poieumenos tesi neusi di alleleon}.]\r\n\r\n5 [ {tou Dareiou}: a conjecture based upon Valla's translation.

THE SEVENTH BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED POLYMNIA\r\n\r\n1. Now when the report came to Dareios the son of Hystaspes of the\r\nbattle which was fought at Marathon, the king, who even before this had\r\nbeen greatly exasperated with the Athenians on account of the attack\r\nmade upon Sardis, then far more than before displayed indignation, and\r\nwas far more desirous of making a march against Hellas. Accordingly\r\nat once he sent messengers to the various cities and ordered that they\r\nshould get ready a force, appointing to each people to supply much more\r\nthan at the former time, and not only ships of war, but also horses and\r\nprovisions and transport vessels; 1 and when these commands were carried\r\nround, all Asia was moved for three years, for all the best men were\r\nbeing enlisted for the expedition against Hellas, and were making\r\npreparations. In the fourth year however the Egyptians, who had been\r\nreduced to subjection by Cambyses, revolted from the Persians; and then\r\nhe was even more desirous of marching against both these nations.\r\n\r\n2. While Dareios was thus preparing to set out against Egypt and against\r\nAthens, there arose a great strife among his sons about the supreme\r\npower; and they said that he must not make his expeditions until he\r\nhad designated one of them to be king, according to the custom of the\r\nPersians. For to Dareios already before he became king three sons had\r\nbeen born of his former wife the daughter of Gobryas, and after he\r\nbecame king four other sons of Atossa the daughter of Cyrus: of the\r\nfirst the eldest was Artobazanes, and of those who had been born later,\r\nXerxes. These being not of the same mother were at strife with one\r\nanother, Artobazanes contending that he was the eldest of all the sons,\r\nand that it was a custom maintained by all men that the eldest should\r\nhave the rule, and Xerxes arguing that he was the son of Atossa the\r\ndaughter of Cyrus, and that Cyrus was he who had won for the Persians\r\ntheir freedom.\r\n\r\n3. Now while Dareios did not as yet declare his judgment, it chanced\r\nthat Demaratos also, the son of Ariston, had come up to Susa at this\r\nvery same time, having been deprived of the kingdom in Sparta and having\r\nlaid upon himself a sentence of exile from Lacedemon. This man, hearing\r\nof the difference between the sons of Dareios, came (as it is reported\r\nof him) and counselled Xerxes to say in addition to those things which\r\nhe was wont to say, that he had been born to Dareios at the time when he\r\nwas already reigning as king and was holding the supreme power over the\r\nPersians, while Artobazanes had been born while Dareios was still in\r\na private station: it was not fitting therefore nor just that another\r\nshould have the honour before him; for even in Sparta, suggested\r\nDemaratos, this was the custom, that is to say, if some of the sons had\r\nbeen born first, before their father began to reign, and another came\r\nafter, born later while he was reigning, the succession of the kingdom\r\nbelonged to him who had been born later. Xerxes accordingly made use of\r\nthe suggestion of Demaratos; and Dareios perceiving that he spoke that\r\nwhich was just, designated him to be king. It is my opinion however that\r\neven without this suggestion Xerxes would have become king, for Atossa\r\nwas all-powerful.\r\n\r\n4. Then having designated Xerxes to the Persians as their king, Dareios\r\nwished to go on his expeditions. However in the next year after this and\r\nafter the revolt of Egypt, it came to pass that Dareios himself died,\r\nhaving been king in all six-and-thirty years; and thus he did not\r\nsucceed in taking vengeance either upon the revolted Egyptians or upon\r\nthe Athenians.\r\n\r\n5. Dareios being dead the kingdom passed to his son Xerxes. Now Xerxes\r\nat the first was by no means anxious to make a march against Hellas, but\r\nagainst Egypt he continued to gather a force. Mardonios however, the son\r\nof Gobryas, who was a cousin of Xerxes, being sister's son to Dareios,\r\nwas ever at his side, and having power with him more than any other\r\nof the Persians, he kept continually to such discourse as this which\r\nfollows, saying: \"Master, it is not fitting that the Athenians, after\r\nhaving done to the Persians very great evil, should not pay the penalty\r\nfor that which they have done. What if thou shouldest 2 at this present\r\ntime do that which thou hast in thy hands to do; and when thou hast\r\ntamed the land of Egypt, which has broken out insolently against us,\r\nthen do thou march an army against Athens, that a good report may be\r\nmade of thee by men, and that in future every one may beware of making\r\nexpeditions against thy land.\" Thus far his speech had to do with\r\nvengeance, 3 and to this he would make addition as follows, saying\r\nthat Europe was a very fair land and bore all kinds of trees that are\r\ncultivated for fruit, and was of excellent fertility, and such that the\r\nking alone of all mortals was worthy to possess it.\r\n\r\n6. These things he was wont to say, since he was one who had a desire\r\nfor perilous enterprise and wished to be himself the governor of Hellas\r\nunder the king. So in time he prevailed upon Xerxes and persuaded him to\r\ndo this; for other things also assisted him and proved helpful to him\r\nin persuading Xerxes. In the first place there had come from Thessaly\r\nmessengers sent by the Aleuadai, who were inviting the king to come\r\nagainst Hellas and were showing great zeal in his cause, (now these\r\nAleuadai were kings of Thessaly): and then secondly those of the sons of\r\nPeisistratos who had come up to Susa were inviting him also, holding to\r\nthe same arguments as the Aleuadai; and moreover they offered him yet\r\nmore inducement in addition to these; for there was one Onomacritos an\r\nAthenian, who both uttered oracles and also had collected and arranged\r\nthe oracles of Musaios; 4 and with this man they had come up, after they\r\nhad first reconciled the enmity between them. For Onomacritos had been\r\ndriven forth from Athens by Hipparchos the son of Peisistratos, having\r\nbeen caught by Lasos of Hermion interpolating in the works of Musaios\r\nan oracle to the effect that the islands which lie off Lemnos should\r\ndisappear 5 under the sea. For this reason Hipparchos drove him forth,\r\nhaving before this time been very much wont to consult him. Now however\r\nhe had gone up with them; and when he had come into the presence of the\r\nking, the sons of Peisistratos spoke of him in magnificent terms, and\r\nhe repeated some of the oracles; and if there was in them anything\r\nwhich imported disaster to the Barbarians, of this he said nothing;\r\nbut choosing out of them the most fortunate things he told how it was\r\ndestined that the Hellespont should be yoked with a bridge by a Persian,\r\nand he set forth the manner of the march. He then thus urged Xerxes with\r\noracles, while the sons of Peisistratos and the Aleuadai pressed him\r\nwith their advice.\r\n\r\n7. So when Xerxes had been persuaded to make an expedition against\r\nHellas, then in the next year after the death of Dareios he made a march\r\nfirst against those who had revolted. Having subdued these and having\r\nreduced all Egypt to slavery much greater than it had suffered in the\r\nreign of Dareios, he entrusted the government of it to Achaimenes his\r\nown brother, a son of Dareios. Now this Achaimenes being a governor of\r\nEgypt was slain afterwards by Inaros the son of Psammetichos, a Libyan.\r\n\r\n8. Xerxes then after the conquest of Egypt, being about to take in hand\r\nthe expedition against Athens, summoned a chosen assembly of the best\r\nmen among the Persians, that he might both learn their opinions and\r\nhimself in the presence of all declare that which he intended to do;\r\nand when they were assembled, Xerxes spoke to them as follows: (a)\r\n\"Persians, I shall not be the first to establish this custom in your\r\nnation, but having received it from others I shall follow it: for as I\r\nam informed by those who are older than myself, we never yet have kept\r\nquiet since we received this supremacy in succession to the Medes, when\r\nCyrus overthrew Astyages; but God thus leads us, and for ourselves tends\r\nto good that we are busied about many things. Now about the nations\r\nwhich Cyrus and Cambyses and my father Dareios subdued and added to\r\ntheir possessions there is no need for me to speak, since ye know well:\r\nand as for me, from the day when I received by inheritance this throne\r\nupon which I sit 6 I carefully considered always how in this honourable\r\nplace I might not fall short of those who have been before me, nor\r\nadd less power to the dominion of the Persians: and thus carefully\r\nconsidering I find a way by which not only glory may be won by us,\r\ntogether with a land not less in extent nor worse than that which we now\r\npossess, (and indeed more varied in its productions), but also vengeance\r\nand retribution may be brought about. Wherefore I have assembled you\r\ntogether now, in order that I may communicate to you that which I have\r\nit in my mind to do. (b) I design to yoke the Hellespont with a bridge,\r\nand to march an army through Europe against Hellas, in order that I may\r\ntake vengeance on the Athenians for all the things which they have done\r\nboth to the Persians and to my father. Ye saw how my father Dareios also\r\nwas purposing to make an expedition against these men; but he has ended\r\nhis life and did not succeed in taking vengeance upon them. I however,\r\non behalf of him and also of the other Persians, will not cease until I\r\nhave conquered Athens and burnt it with fire; seeing that they did wrong\r\nunprovoked to me and to my father. First they went to Sardis, having\r\ncome with Aristagoras the Milesian our slave, and they set fire to the\r\nsacred groves and the temples; and then secondly, what things they did\r\nto us when we disembarked in their land, at the time when Datis and\r\nArtaphrenes were commanders of our army, ye all know well, as I think.\r\n7 (c) For these reasons 8 I have resolved to make an expedition against\r\nthem, and reckoning I find in the matter so many good things as ye shall\r\nhear:--if we shall subdue these and the neighbours of these, who dwell\r\nin the land of Pelops the Phrygian, we shall cause the Persian land to\r\nhave the same boundaries as the heaven of Zeus; since in truth upon no\r\nland will the sun look down which borders ours, but I with your help\r\nshall make all the lands into one land, having passed through the whole\r\nextent of Europe. For I am informed that things are so, namely that\r\nthere is no city of men nor any race of human beings remaining, which\r\nwill be able to come to a contest with us, when those whom I just now\r\nmentioned have been removed out of the way. Thus both those who have\r\ncommitted wrong against us will have the yoke of slavery, and also those\r\nwho have not committed wrong. (d) And ye will please me best if ye do\r\nthis:--whensoever I shall signify to you the time at which ye ought to\r\ncome, ye must appear every one of you with zeal for the service; and\r\nwhosoever shall come with a force best equipped, to him I will give\r\ngifts such as are accounted in our land to be the most honourable.\r\nThus must these things be done: but that I may not seem to you to be\r\nfollowing my own counsel alone, I propose the matter for discussion,\r\nbidding any one of you who desires it, declare his opinion.\"\r\n\r\n9. Having thus spoken he ceased; and after him Mardonios said: \"Master,\r\nthou dost surpass not only all the Persians who were before thee, but\r\nalso those who shall come after, since thou didst not only attain in\r\nthy words to that which is best and truest as regards other matters, but\r\nalso thou wilt not permit the Ionians who dwell in Europe to make a mock\r\nof us, having no just right to do so: for a strange thing it would\r\nbe if, when we have subdued and kept as our servants Sacans, Indians,\r\nEthiopians, Assyrians, and other nations many in number and great, who\r\nhave done no wrong to the Persians, because we desired to add to our\r\ndominions, we should not take vengeance on the Hellenes who committed\r\nwrong against us unprovoked. (a) Of what should we be afraid?--what\r\ngathering of numbers, or what resources of money? for their manner of\r\nfight we know, and as for their resources, we know that they are feeble;\r\nand we have moreover subdued already their sons, those I mean who are\r\nsettled in our land and are called Ionians, Aiolians, and Dorians.\r\nMoreover I myself formerly made trial of marching against these men,\r\nbeing commanded thereto by thy father; and although I marched as far as\r\nMacedonia, and fell but little short of coming to Athens itself, no man\r\ncame to oppose me in fight. (b) And yet it is true that the Hellenes\r\nmake wars, but (as I am informed) very much without wise consideration,\r\nby reason of obstinacy and want of skill: for when they have proclaimed\r\nwar upon one another, they find out first the fairest and smoothest\r\nplace, and to this they come down and fight; so that even the victors\r\ndepart from the fight with great loss, and as to the vanquished, of them\r\nI make no mention at all, for they are utterly destroyed. They ought\r\nhowever, being men who speak the same language, to make use of heralds\r\nand messengers and so to take up their differences and settle them in\r\nany way rather than by battles; but if they must absolutely war with one\r\nanother, they ought to find out each of them that place in which they\r\nthemselves are hardest to overcome, and here to make their trial.\r\nTherefore the Hellenes, since they use no good way, when I had marched\r\nas far as the land of Macedonia, did not come to the resolution of\r\nfighting with me. (c) Who then is likely to set himself against thee,\r\nO king, offering war, when thou art leading both all the multitudes of\r\nAsia and the whole number of the ships? I for my part am of opinion that\r\nthe power of the Hellenes has not attained to such a pitch of boldness:\r\nbut if after all I should prove to be deceived in my judgment, and they\r\nstirred up by inconsiderate folly should come to battle with us, they\r\nwould learn that we are the best of all men in the matters of war.\r\nHowever that may be, let not anything be left untried; for nothing comes\r\nof itself, but from trial all things are wont to come to men.\"\r\n\r\n10. Mardonios having thus smoothed over the resolution expressed by\r\nXerxes had ceased speaking: and when the other Persians were silent and\r\ndid not venture to declare an opinion contrary to that which had been\r\nproposed, then Artabanos the son of Hystaspes, being father's brother to\r\nXerxes and having reliance upon that, spoke as follows: (a) \"O king,\r\nif opinions opposed to one another be not spoken, it is not possible to\r\nselect the better in making the choice, but one must accept that which\r\nhas been spoken; if however opposite opinions be uttered, this is\r\npossible; just as we do not distinguish the gold which is free from\r\nalloy when it is alone by itself, but when we rub it on the touchstone\r\nin comparison with other gold, then we distinguish that which is\r\nthe better. Now I gave advice to thy father Dareios also, who was my\r\nbrother, not to march against the Scythians, men who occupied no abiding\r\ncity in any part of the earth. He however, expecting that he would\r\nsubdue the Scythians who were nomads, did not listen to me; but he made\r\na march and came back from it with the loss of many good men of his\r\narmy. But thou, O king, art intending to march against men who are much\r\nbetter than the Scythians, men who are reported to be excellent both by\r\nsea and on land: and the thing which is to be feared in this matter it\r\nis right that I should declare to thee. (b) Thou sayest that thou wilt\r\nyoke the Hellespont with a bridge and march an army through Europe to\r\nHellas. Now supposing it chance that we are 9 worsted either by land or\r\nby sea, or even both, for the men are reported to be valiant in fight,\r\n(and we may judge for ourselves that it is so, since the Athenians\r\nby themselves destroyed that great army which came with Datis and\r\nArtaphrenes to the Attic land),--suppose however that they do not\r\nsucceed in both, yet if they shall attack with their ships and conquer\r\nin a sea-fight, and then sail to the Hellespont and break up the bridge,\r\nthis of itself, O king, will prove to be a great peril. (c) Not however\r\nby any native wisdom of my own do I conjecture that this might happen:\r\nI am conjecturing only such a misfortune as all but came upon us at the\r\nformer time, when thy father, having yoked the Bosphorus of Thracia and\r\nmade a bridge over the river Ister, had crossed over to go against the\r\nScythians. At that time the Scythians used every means of entreaty\r\nto persuade the Ionians to break up the passage, to whom it had been\r\nentrusted to guard the bridges of the Ister. At that time, if Histiaios\r\nthe despot of Miletos had followed the opinion of the other despots and\r\nhad not made opposition to them, the power of the Persians would have\r\nbeen brought to an end. Yet it is a fearful thing even to hear it\r\nreported that the whole power of the king had come to depend upon one\r\nhuman creature. 10 (d) Do not thou therefore propose to go into any\r\nsuch danger when there is no need, but do as I say:--at the present time\r\ndissolve this assembly; and afterwards at whatever time it shall seem\r\ngood to thee, when thou hast considered prudently with thyself, proclaim\r\nthat which seems to thee best: for good counsel I hold to be a very\r\ngreat gain; since even if anything shall prove adverse, the counsel\r\nwhich has been taken is no less good, though it has been defeated by\r\nfortune; while he who took counsel badly at first, if good fortune\r\nshould go with him has lighted on a prize by chance, but none the\r\nless for that his counsel was bad. (e) Thou seest how God strikes with\r\nthunderbolts the creatures which stand above the rest and suffers them\r\nnot to make a proud show; while those which are small do not provoke\r\nhim to jealousy: thou seest also how he hurls his darts ever at those\r\nbuildings which are the highest and those trees likewise; for God is\r\nwont to cut short all those things which stand out above the rest. Thus\r\nalso a numerous army is destroyed by one of few men in some such manner\r\nas this, namely when God having become jealous of them casts upon them\r\npanic or thundering from heaven, then they are destroyed utterly and\r\nnot as their worth deserves; for God suffers not any other to have high\r\nthoughts save only himself. (f) Moreover the hastening of any matter\r\nbreeds disasters, whence great losses are wont to be produced; but in\r\nwaiting there are many good things contained, as to which, if they\r\ndo not appear to be good at first, yet one will find them to be so in\r\ncourse of time. (g) To thee, O king, I give this counsel: but thou son\r\nof Gobryas, Mardonios, cease speaking foolish words about the Hellenes,\r\nsince they in no way deserve to be spoken of with slight; for by\r\nuttering slander against the Hellenes thou art stirring the king himself\r\nto make an expedition, and it is to this very end that I think thou art\r\nstraining all thy endeavour. Let not this be so; for slander is a most\r\ngrievous thing: in it the wrongdoers are two, and the person who suffers\r\nwrong is one. The slanderer does a wrong in that he speaks against\r\none who is not present, the other in that he is persuaded of the thing\r\nbefore he gets certain knowledge of it, and he who is not present when\r\nthe words are spoken suffers wrong in the matter thus,--both because he\r\nhas been slandered by the one and because he has been believed to be\r\nbad by the other. (h) However, if it be absolutely needful to make an\r\nexpedition against these men, come, let the king himself remain behind\r\nin the abodes of the Persians, and let us both set to the wager our\r\nsons; and then do thou lead an army by thyself, choosing for thyself\r\nthe men whom thou desirest, and taking an army as large as thou thinkest\r\ngood: and if matters turn out for the king as thou sayest, let my sons\r\nbe slain and let me also be slain in addition to them; but if in the way\r\nwhich I predict, let thy sons suffer this, and with them thyself also,\r\nif thou shalt return back. But if thou art not willing to undergo this\r\nproof, but wilt by all means lead an army against Hellas, then I say\r\nthat those who are left behind in this land will hear 11 that Mardonios,\r\nafter having done a great mischief to the Persians, is torn by dogs and\r\nbirds, either in the land of the Athenians, or else perchance thou wilt\r\nbe in the land of the Lacedemonians (unless indeed this should have come\r\nto pass even before that upon the way), and that thou hast at length\r\nbeen made aware against what kind of men thou art persuading the king to\r\nmarch.\"\r\n\r\n11. Artabanos thus spoke; and Xerxes enraged by it made answer as\r\nfollows: \"Artabanos, thou art my father's brother, and this shall save\r\nthee from receiving any recompense such as thy foolish words deserve.\r\nYet I attach to thee this dishonour, seeing that thou art a coward and\r\nspiritless, namely that thou do not march with me against Hellas, but\r\nremain here together with the women; and I, even without thy help,\r\nwill accomplish all the things which I said: for I would I might not be\r\ndescended from Dareios, the son of Hystaspes, the son of Arsames, the\r\nson of Ariaramnes, the son of Teïspes, or from Cyrus, 12 the son of\r\nCambyses, the son of Teïspes, the son of Achaimenes, if I take not\r\nvengeance on the Athenians; since I know well that if we shall keep\r\nquiet, yet they will not do so, but will again 13 march against our\r\nland, if we may judge by the deeds which have been done by them to begin\r\nwith, since they both set fire to Sardis and marched upon Asia. It is\r\nnot possible therefore that either side should retire from the quarrel,\r\nbut the question before us is whether we shall do or whether we shall\r\nsuffer; whether all these regions shall come to be under the Hellenes\r\nor all those under the Persians: for in our hostility there is no middle\r\ncourse. It follows then now that it is well for us, having suffered\r\nwrong first, to take revenge, that I may find out also what is this\r\nterrible thing which I shall suffer if I lead an army against these\r\nmen,--men whom Pelops the Phrygian, who was the slave of my forefathers,\r\nso subdued that even to the present day both the men themselves and\r\ntheir land are called after the name of him who subdued them.\"\r\n\r\n12. Thus far was it spoken then; but afterwards when darkness came on,\r\nthe opinion of Artabanos tormented Xerxes continually; and making night\r\nhis counsellor he found that it was by no means to his advantage to make\r\nthe march against Hellas. So when he had thus made a new resolve, he\r\nfell asleep, and in the night he saw, as is reported by the Persians, a\r\nvision as follows:--Xerxes thought that a man tall and comely of shape\r\ncame and stood by him and said: \"Art thou indeed changing thy counsel,\r\nO Persian, of leading an expedition against Hellas, now that thou hast\r\nmade proclamation that the Persians shall collect an army? Thou dost not\r\nwell in changing thy counsel, nor will he who is here present with thee\r\nexcuse thee from it; 1301 but as thou didst take counsel in the day to\r\ndo, by that way go.\"\r\n\r\n13. After he had said this, Xerxes thought that he who had spoken flew\r\naway; and when day had dawned he made no account of this dream, but\r\ngathered together the Persians whom he had assembled also the former\r\ntime and said to them these words: \"Persians, pardon me that I make\r\nquick changes in my counsel; for in judgment not yet am I come to my\r\nprime, and they who advise me to do the things which I said, do not\r\nfor any long time leave me to myself. However, although at first when\r\nI heard the opinion of Artabanos my youthful impulses burst out, 14 so\r\nthat I cast out unseemly words 15 against a man older than myself; yet\r\nnow I acknowledge that he is right, and I shall follow his opinion.\r\nConsider then I have changed my resolve to march against Hellas, and do\r\nye remain still.\"\r\n\r\n14. The Persians accordingly when they heard this were rejoiced and made\r\nobeisance: but when night had come on, the same dream again came and\r\nstood by Xerxes as he lay asleep and said: \"Son of Dareios, it is\r\nmanifest then that thou hast resigned this expedition before the\r\nassembly of the Persians, and that thou hast made no account of my\r\nwords, as if thou hadst heard them from no one at all. Now therefore be\r\nwell assured of this:--if thou do not make thy march forthwith, there\r\nshall thence spring up for thee this result, namely that, as thou didst\r\nin short time become great and mighty, so also thou shalt speedily be\r\nagain brought low.\"\r\n\r\n15. Xerxes then, being very greatly disturbed by fear of the vision,\r\nstarted up from his bed and sent a messenger to summon Artabanos; to\r\nwhom when he came Xerxes spoke thus: \"Artabanos, at the first I was\r\nnot discreet, when I spoke to thee foolish words on account of thy good\r\ncounsel; but after no long time I changed my mind and perceived that I\r\nought to do these things which thou didst suggest to me. I am not able\r\nhowever to do them, although I desire it; for indeed, now that I have\r\nturned about and changed my mind, a dream appears haunting me and by no\r\nmeans approving that I should do so; and just now it has left me even\r\nwith a threat. If therefore it is God who sends it to me, and it is his\r\nabsolute will and pleasure that an army should go against Hellas, this\r\nsame dream will fly to thee also, laying upon thee a charge such as it\r\nhas laid upon me; and it occurs to my mind that this might happen thus,\r\nnamely if thou shouldst take all my attire and put it on, and then seat\r\nthyself on my throne, and after that lie down to sleep in my bed.\"\r\n\r\n16. Xerxes spoke to him thus; and Artabanos was not willing to obey the\r\ncommand at first, since he did not think himself worthy to sit upon\r\nthe royal throne; but at last being urged further he did that which was\r\ncommanded, first having spoken these words: (a) \"It is equally good in\r\nmy judgment, O king, whether a man has wisdom himself or is willing to\r\nfollow the counsel of him who speaks well: and thou, who hast attained\r\nto both these good things, art caused to err by the communications of\r\nevil men; just as they say that the Sea, which is of all things the\r\nmost useful to men, is by blasts of winds falling upon it prevented from\r\ndoing according to its own nature. I however, when I was evil spoken of\r\nby thee, was not so much stung with pain for this, as because, when\r\ntwo opinions were laid before the Persians, the one tending to increase\r\nwanton insolence and the other tending to check it and saying that it\r\nwas a bad thing to teach the soul to endeavour always to have something\r\nmore than the present possession,--because, I say, when such opinions as\r\nthese were laid before us, thou didst choose that one which was the more\r\ndangerous both for thyself and for the Persians. (b) And now that\r\nthou hast turned to the better counsel, thou sayest that when thou art\r\ndisposed to let go the expedition against the Hellenes, a dream haunts\r\nthee sent by some god, which forbids thee to abandon thy enterprise.\r\nNay, but here too thou dost err, my son, since this is not of the Deity;\r\n16 for the dreams of sleep which come roaming about to men, are of such\r\nnature as I shall inform thee, being by many years older than thou. The\r\nvisions of dreams are wont to hover above us 17 in such form 18 for the\r\nmost part as the things of which we were thinking during the day; and we\r\nin the days preceding were very much occupied with this campaign. (c) If\r\nhowever after all this is not such a thing as I interpret it to be, but\r\nis something which is concerned with God, thou hast summed the matter up\r\nin that which thou hast said: let it appear, as thou sayest, to me also,\r\nas to thee, and give commands. But supposing that it desires to appear\r\nto me at all, it is not bound to appear to me any the more if I have thy\r\ngarments on me than if I have my own, nor any more if I take my rest in\r\nthy bed than if I am in thy own; for assuredly this thing, whatever\r\nit may be, which appears to thee in thy sleep, is not so foolish as\r\nto suppose, when it sees me, that it is thou, judging so because the\r\ngarments are thine. That however which we must find out now is this,\r\nnamely if it will hold me in no account, and not think fit to appear to\r\nme, whether I have my own garments or whether I have thine, but continue\r\nstill to haunt thee; 19 for if it shall indeed haunt thee perpetually,\r\nI shall myself also be disposed to say that it is of the Deity. But if\r\nthou hast resolved that it shall be so, and it is not possible to turn\r\naside this thy resolution, but I must go to sleep in thy bed, then let\r\nit appear to me also, when I perform these things: but until then I\r\nshall hold to the opinion which I now have.\"\r\n\r\n17. Having thus said Artabanos, expecting that he would prove that\r\nXerxes was speaking folly, did that which was commanded him; and having\r\nput on the garments of Xerxes and seated himself in the royal throne,\r\nhe afterwards went to bed: and when he had fallen asleep, the same dream\r\ncame to him which used to come to Xerxes, and standing over Artabanos\r\nspoke these words: \"Art thou indeed he who endeavours to dissuade Xerxes\r\nfrom making a march against Hellas, pretending to have a care of him?\r\nHowever, neither in the future nor now at the present shalt thou escape\r\nunpunished for trying to turn away that which is destined to come to\r\npass: and as for Xerxes, that which he must suffer if he disobeys, hath\r\nbeen shown already to the man himself.\"\r\n\r\n18. Thus it seemed to Artabanos that the dream threatened him, and at\r\nthe same time was just about to burn out his eyes with hot irons; and\r\nwith a loud cry he started up from his bed, and sitting down beside\r\nXerxes he related to him throughout the vision of the dream, and then\r\nsaid to him as follows: \"I, O king, as one who has seen before now many\r\ngreat things brought to their fall by things less, urged thee not to\r\nyield in all things to the inclination of thy youth, since I knew that\r\nit was evil to have desire after many things; remembering on the one\r\nhand the march of Cyrus against the Massagetai, what fortune it had, and\r\nalso that of Cambyses against the Ethiopians; and being myself one who\r\ntook part with Dareios in the campaign against the Scythians. Knowing\r\nthese things I had the opinion that thou wert to be envied of all men,\r\nso long as thou shouldest keep still. Since however there comes a divine\r\nimpulse, and, as it seems, a destruction sent by heaven is taking hold\r\nof the Hellenes, I for my part am both changed in myself and also I\r\nreverse my opinions; and do thou signify to the Persians the message\r\nwhich is sent to thee from God, bidding them follow the commands which\r\nwere given by thee at first with regard to the preparations to be\r\nmade; and endeavour that on thy side nothing may be wanting, since God\r\ndelivers the matter into thy hands.\" These things having been said, both\r\nwere excited to confidence by the vision, and so soon as it became\r\nday, Xerxes communicated the matter to the Persians, and Artabanos,\r\nwho before was the only man who came forward to dissuade him, now came\r\nforward to urge on the design.\r\n\r\n19. Xerxes being thus desirous to make the expedition, there came to\r\nhim after this a third vision in his sleep, which the Magians, when they\r\nheard it, explained to have reference to the dominion of the whole Earth\r\nand to mean that all men should be subject to him; and the vision was\r\nthis:--Xerxes thought that he had been crowned with a wreath of an\r\nolive-branch and that the shoots growing from the olive-tree covered\r\nthe whole Earth; and after that, the wreath, placed as it was about his\r\nhead, disappeared. When the Magians had thus interpreted the vision,\r\nforthwith every man of the Persians who had been assembled together\r\ndeparted to his own province and was zealous by all means to perform the\r\ncommands, desiring each one to receive for himself the gifts which\r\nhad been proposed: and thus Xerxes was gathering his army together,\r\nsearching every region of the continent.\r\n\r\n20. During four full years from the conquest of Egypt he was preparing\r\nthe army and the things that were of service for the army, and in the\r\ncourse of the fifth year 20 he began his campaign with a host of great\r\nmultitude. For of all the armies of which we have knowledge this proved\r\nto be by far the greatest; so that neither that led by Dareios against\r\nthe Scythians appears anything as compared with it, nor the Scythian\r\nhost, when the Scythians pursuing the Kimmerians made invasion of the\r\nMedian land and subdued and occupied nearly all the upper parts of Asia,\r\nfor which invasion afterwards Dareios attempted to take vengeance,\r\nnor that led by the sons of Atreus to Ilion, to judge by that which is\r\nreported of their expedition, nor that of the Mysians and Teucrians,\r\nbefore the Trojan war, who passed over into Europe by the Bosphorus and\r\nnot only subdued all the Thracians, but came down also as far as the\r\nIonian Sea 21 and marched southwards to the river Peneios.\r\n\r\n21. All these expeditions put together, with others, if there be any,\r\nadded to them, 22 are not equal to this one alone. For what nation\r\ndid Xerxes not lead out of Asia against Hellas? and what water was not\r\nexhausted, being drunk by his host, except only the great rivers?\r\nFor some supplied ships, and others were appointed to serve in the\r\nland-army; to some it was appointed to furnish cavalry, and to others\r\nvessels to carry horses, while they served in the expedition themselves\r\nalso; 23 others were ordered to furnish ships of war for the bridges,\r\nand others again ships with provisions.\r\n\r\n22. Then in the first place, since the former fleet had suffered\r\ndisaster in sailing round Athos, preparations had been going on for\r\nabout three years past with regard to Athos: for triremes lay at anchor\r\nat Elaius in the Chersonese, and with this for their starting point men\r\nof all nations belonging to the army worked at digging, compelled by\r\nthe lash; and the men went to the work regularly in succession: moreover\r\nthose who dwelt round about Athos worked also at the digging: and\r\nBubares the son of Megabazos and Artachaies the son of Artaios, Persians\r\nboth, were set over the work. Now Athos is a mountain great and famous,\r\nrunning down to the sea and inhabited by men: and where the mountain\r\nends on the side of the mainland the place is like a peninsula with an\r\nisthmus about twelve furlongs 24 across. Here it is plain land or hills\r\nof no great size, extending from the sea of the Acanthians to that which\r\nlies off Torone; and on this isthmus, where Athos ends, is situated a\r\nHellenic city called Sane: moreover there are others beyond Sane 25 and\r\nwithin the peninsula of Athos, all which at this time the Persian had\r\nresolved to make into cities of an island and no longer of the mainland;\r\nthese are, Dion, Olophyxos, Acrothoon, Thyssos, Cleonai.\r\n\r\n23. These are the cities which occupy Athos: and they dug as follows,\r\nthe country being divided among the Barbarians by nations for the\r\nwork:--at the city of Sane they drew a straight line across the isthmus,\r\nand when the channel became deep, those who stood lowest dug, while\r\nothers delivered the earth as it was dug out to other men who stood\r\nabove, as upon steps, and they again to others when it was received,\r\nuntil they came to those that were highest; and these bore it away and\r\ncast it forth. Now the others except the Phenicians had double toil by\r\nthe breaking down of the steep edges of their excavation; for since they\r\nendeavoured to make the opening at the top and that at the bottom both\r\nof the same measure, some such thing was likely to result, as they\r\nworked: but the Phenicians, who are apt to show ability in their works\r\ngenerally, did so in this work also; for when they had had assigned\r\nto them by lot so much as fell to their share, they proceeded to dig,\r\nmaking the opening of the excavation at the top twice as wide as the\r\nchannel itself was to be; and as the work went forward, they kept\r\ncontracting the width; so that, when they came to the bottom, their work\r\nwas made of equal width with that of the others. Now there is a meadow\r\nthere, in which there was made for them a market and a place for buying\r\nand selling; and great quantities of corn came for them regularly from\r\nAsia, ready ground.\r\n\r\n24. It seems to me, making conjecture of this work, that Xerxes when\r\nhe ordered this to be dug was moved by a love of magnificence and by\r\na desire to make a display of his power and to leave a memorial behind\r\nhim; for though they might have drawn the ships across the isthmus with\r\nno great labour, he bade them dig a channel for the sea of such breadth\r\nthat two triremes might sail through, propelled side by side. To these\r\nsame men to whom the digging had been appointed, it was appointed also\r\nto make a bridge over the river Strymon, yoking together the banks.\r\n\r\n25. These things were being done by Xerxes thus; and meanwhile he caused\r\nropes also to be prepared for the bridges, made of papyrus and of white\r\nflax, 26 appointing this to the Phenicians and Egyptians; and also he\r\nwas making preparations to store provisions for his army on the way,\r\nthat neither the army itself nor the baggage animals might suffer from\r\nscarcity, as they made their march against Hellas. Accordingly, when he\r\nhad learnt by inquiry of the various places, he bade them make stores\r\nwhere it was most convenient, carrying supplies to different parts by\r\nmerchant ships and ferry-boats from all the countries of Asia. So they\r\nconveyed the greater part of the corn 27 to the place which is called\r\nLeuke Acte in Thrace, while others conveyed stores to Tyrodiza of the\r\nPerinthians, others to Doriscos, others to Eïon on the Strymon, and\r\nothers to Macedonia, the work being distributed between them.\r\n\r\n26. During the time that these were working at the task which had been\r\nproposed to them, the whole land-army had been assembled together and\r\nwas marching with Xerxes to Sardis, setting forth from Critalla in\r\nCappadokia; for there it had been ordered that the whole army should\r\nassemble, which was to go with Xerxes himself by the land: but which of\r\nthe governors of provinces brought the best equipped force and received\r\nfrom the king the gifts proposed, I am not able to say, for I do not\r\nknow that they even came to a competition in this matter. Then after\r\nthey had crossed the river Halys and had entered Phrygia, marching\r\nthrough this land they came to Kelainai, where the springs of the river\r\nMaiander come up, and also those of another river not less than the\r\nMaiander, whose name is Catarractes; 28 this rises in the market-place\r\nitself of Kelainai and runs into the Maiander: and here also is hanging\r\nup in the city the skin of Marsyas the Silenos, which is said by the\r\nPhrygians to have been flayed off and hung up by Apollo.\r\n\r\n27. In this city Pythios the son of Atys, a Lydian, was waiting for the\r\nking and entertained his whole army, as well as Xerxes himself, with\r\nthe most magnificent hospitality: moreover he professed himself ready\r\nto supply money for the war. So when Pythios offered money, Xerxes asked\r\nthose of the Persians who were present, who Pythios was and how much\r\nmoney he possessed, that he made this offer. They said: \"O king, this is\r\nhe who presented thy father Dareios with the golden plane-tree and the\r\ngolden vine; and even now he is in wealth the first of all men of whom\r\nwe know, excepting thee only.\"\r\n\r\n28. Marvelling at the conclusion of these words Xerxes himself asked of\r\nPythios then, how much money he had; and he said: \"O king, I will not\r\nconceal the truth from thee, nor will I allege as an excuse that I do\r\nnot know my own substance, but I will enumerate it to thee exactly,\r\nsince I know the truth: for as soon as I heard that thou wert coming\r\ndown to the Sea of Hellas, desiring to give thee money for the war I\r\nascertained the truth, and calculating I found that I had of silver two\r\nthousand talents, and of gold four hundred myriads 29 of daric staters\r\n30 all but seven thousand: and with this money I present thee. For\r\nmyself I have sufficient livelihood from my slaves and from my estates\r\nof land.\"\r\n\r\n29. Thus he said; and Xerxes was pleased by the things which he had\r\nspoken, and replied: \"Lydian host, ever since I went forth from the\r\nPersian land I have encountered no man up to this time who was desirous\r\nto entertain my army, or who came into my presence and made offer of his\r\nown free will to contribute money to me for the war, except only thee:\r\nand thou not only didst entertain my army magnificently, but also now\r\ndost make offer of great sums of money. To thee therefore in return I\r\ngive these rewards,--I make thee my guest-friend, and I will complete\r\nfor thee the four hundred myriads of staters by giving from myself the\r\nseven thousand, in order that thy four hundred myriads may not fall\r\nshort by seven thousand, but thou mayest have a full sum in thy\r\nreckoning, completed thus by me. Keep possession of that which thou hast\r\ngot for thyself, and be sure to act always thus; for if thou doest so,\r\nthou wilt have no cause to repent either at the time or afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n30. Having thus said and having accomplished his promise, he continued\r\nhis march onwards; and passing by a city of the Phrygians called Anaua\r\nand a lake whence salt is obtained, he came to Colossai, a great city\r\nof Phrygia, where the river Lycos falls into an opening of the earth and\r\ndisappears from view, and then after an interval of about five furlongs\r\nit comes up to view again, and this river also flows into the Maiander.\r\nSetting forth from Colossai towards the boundaries of the Phrygians and\r\nLydians, the army arrived at the city of Kydrara, where a pillar 3001\r\nis fixed, set up by Croesus, which declares by an inscription that the\r\nboundaries are there.\r\n\r\n31. From Phrygia then he entered Lydia; and here the road parts into\r\ntwo, and that which goes to the left leads towards Caria, while that\r\nwhich goes to the right leads to Sardis; and travelling by this latter\r\nroad one must needs cross the river Maiander and pass by the city\r\nof Callatebos, where men live whose trade it is to make honey of the\r\ntamarisk-tree and of wheat-flour. By this road went Xerxes and found a\r\nplane-tree, to which for its beauty he gave an adornment of gold, and\r\nappointed that some one should have charge of it always in undying\r\nsuccession; 31 and on the next day he came to the city of the Lydians.\r\n\r\n32. Having come to Sardis he proceeded first to send heralds to Hellas,\r\nto ask for earth and water, and also to give notice beforehand to\r\nprepare meals for the king; except that he sent neither to Athens nor\r\nLacedemon to ask for earth, but to all the other States: and the reason\r\nwhy he sent the second time to ask for earth and water was this,--as\r\nmany as had not given at the former time to Dareios when he sent, these\r\nhe thought would certainly give now by reason of their fear: this matter\r\nit was about which he desired to have certain knowledge, and he sent\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n33. After this he made his preparations intending to march to Abydos:\r\nand meanwhile they were bridging over the Hellespont from Asia to\r\nEurope. Now there is in the Chersonese of the Hellespont between the\r\ncity of Sestos and Madytos, a broad foreland 32 running down into\r\nthe sea right opposite Abydos; this is the place where no long time\r\nafterwards the Athenians under the command of Xanthippos the son of\r\nAriphron, having taken Artaÿctes a Persian, who was the governor of\r\nSestos, nailed him alive to a board with hands and feet extended (he was\r\nthe man who was wont to take women with him to the temple of Protesilaos\r\nat Elaius and to do things there which are not lawful).\r\n\r\n34. To this foreland they on whom this work was laid were making their\r\nbridges, starting from Abydos, the Phenicians constructing the one with\r\nropes of white flax, and the Egyptians the other, which was made with\r\npapyrus rope. Now from Abydos to the opposite shore is a distance of\r\nseven furlongs. But when the strait had been bridged over, a great storm\r\ncame on and dashed together all the work that had been made and broke it\r\nup. Then when Xerxes heard it he was exceedingly enraged, and bade them\r\nscourge the Hellespont with three hundred strokes of the lash and let\r\ndown into the sea a pair of fetters. Nay, I have heard further that he\r\nsent branders also with them to brand the Hellespont. However this\r\nmay be, he enjoined them, as they were beating, to say Barbarian and\r\npresumptuous words as follows: \"Thou bitter water, thy master lays upon\r\nthee this penalty, because thou didst wrong him not having suffered any\r\nwrong from him: and Xerxes the king will pass over thee whether thou be\r\nwilling or no; but with right, as it seems, no man doeth sacrifice to\r\nthee, seeing that thou art a treacherous 33 and briny stream.\" The sea\r\nhe enjoined them to chastise thus, and also he bade them cut off the\r\nheads of those who were appointed to have charge over the bridging of\r\nthe Hellespont.\r\n\r\n36. Thus then the men did, to whom this ungracious office belonged; and\r\nmeanwhile other chief-constructors proceeded to make the bridges;\r\nand thus they made them:--They put together fifty-oared galleys and\r\ntriremes, three hundred and sixty to be under the bridge towards the\r\nEuxine Sea, and three hundred and fourteen to be under the other, the\r\nvessels lying in the direction of the stream of the Hellespont (though\r\ncrosswise in respect to the Pontus), to support the tension of the\r\nropes. 34 They placed them together thus, and let down very large\r\nanchors, those on the one side 35 towards the Pontus because of the\r\nwinds which blow from within outwards, and on the other side, towards\r\nthe West and the Egean, because of the South-East 36 and South Winds.\r\nThey left also an opening for a passage through, so that any who wished\r\nmight be able to sail into the Pontus with small vessels, 37 and also\r\nfrom the Pontus outwards. Having thus done, they proceeded to stretch\r\ntight the ropes, straining them with wooden windlasses, not now\r\nappointing the two kinds of rope to be used apart from one another, but\r\nassigning to each bridge two ropes of white flax and four of the papyrus\r\nropes. The thickness and beauty of make was the same for both, but the\r\nflaxen ropes were heavier in proportion, 38 and of this rope a cubit\r\nweighed one talent. When the passage was bridged over, they sawed up\r\nlogs of wood, and making them equal in length to the breadth of the\r\nbridge they laid them above the stretched ropes, and having set them\r\nthus in order they again fastened them above. 39 When this was done,\r\nthey carried on brushwood, and having set the brushwood also in place,\r\nthey carried on to it earth; and when they had stamped down the\r\nearth firmly, they built a barrier along on each side, so that the\r\nbaggage-animals and horses might not be frightened by looking out over\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n37. When the construction of the bridges had been finished, and the\r\nworks about Athos, both the embankments about the mouths of the channel,\r\nwhich were made because of the breaking of the sea upon the beach, that\r\nthe mouths of it might not be filled up, and the channel itself, were\r\nreported to be fully completed, then, after they had passed the winter\r\nat Sardis, the army set forth from thence fully equipped, at the\r\nbeginning of spring, to march to Abydos; and when it had just set forth,\r\nthe Sun left his place in the heaven and was invisible, though there was\r\nno gathering of clouds and the sky was perfectly clear; and instead of\r\nday it became night. When Xerxes saw and perceived this, it became a\r\nmatter of concern to him; and he asked the Magians what the appearance\r\nmeant to portend. These declared that the god was foreshowing to the\r\nHellenes a leaving 40 of their cities, saying that the Sun was the\r\nforeshower of events for the Hellenes, but the Moon for the Persians.\r\nHaving been thus informed, Xerxes proceeded on the march with very great\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n38. Then as he was leading forth his army on its march, Pythios the\r\nLydian, being alarmed by the appearance in the heavens and elated by\r\nthe gifts which he had received, came to Xerxes, and said as follows:\r\n\"Master, I would desire to receive from thee a certain thing at my\r\nrequest, which, as it chances, is for thee an easy thing to grant, but\r\na great thing for me, if I obtain it.\" Then Xerxes, thinking that his\r\nrequest would be for anything rather than that which he actually asked,\r\nsaid that he would grant it, and bade him speak and say what he desired.\r\nHe then, when he heard this, was encouraged, and spoke these words:\r\n\"Master, I have, as it chances, five sons, and it is their fortune to\r\nbe all going together with thee on the march against Hellas. Do thou,\r\ntherefore, O king, have compassion upon me, who have come to so great\r\nan age, and release from serving in the expedition one of my sons,\r\nthe eldest, in order that he may be caretaker both of myself and of\r\nmy wealth: but the other four take with thyself, and after thou hast\r\naccomplished that which thou hast in thy mind, mayest thou have a safe\r\nreturn home.\"\r\n\r\n38. Then Xerxes was exceedingly angry and made answer with these words:\r\n\"Thou wretched man, dost thou dare, when I am going on a march myself\r\nagainst Hellas, and am taking my sons and my brothers and my relations\r\nand friends, dost thou dare to make any mention of a son of thine,\r\nseeing that thou art my slave, who ought to have been accompanying me\r\nthyself with thy whole household and thy wife as well? Now therefore\r\nbe assured of this, that the passionate spirit of man dwells within the\r\nears; and when it has heard good things, it fills the body with delight,\r\nbut when it has heard the opposite things to this, it swells up with\r\nanger. As then thou canst not boast of having surpassed the king in\r\nconferring benefits formerly, when thou didst to us good deeds and\r\nmadest offer to do more of the same kind, so now that thou hast turned\r\nto shamelessness, thou shalt receive not thy desert but less than thou\r\ndeservest: for thy gifts of hospitality shall rescue from death thyself\r\nand the four others of thy sons, but thou shalt pay the penalty with the\r\nlife of the one to whom thou dost cling most.\" Having answered thus, he\r\nforthwith commanded those to whom it was appointed to do these things,\r\nto find out the eldest of the sons of Pythios and to cut him in two in\r\nthe middle; and having cut him in two, to dispose the halves, one on\r\nthe right hand of the road and the other on the left, and that the army\r\nshould pass between them by this way.\r\n\r\n40. When these had so done, the army proceeded to pass between; and\r\nfirst the baggage-bearers led the way together with their horses, and\r\nafter these the host composed of all kinds of nations mingled together\r\nwithout distinction: and when more than the half had gone by, an\r\ninterval was left and these were separated from the king. For before\r\nhim went first a thousand horsemen, chosen out of all the Persians; and\r\nafter them a thousand spearmen chosen also from all the Persians, having\r\nthe points of their spears turned down to the ground; and then ten\r\nsacred horses, called \"Nesaian,\" 41 with the fairest possible trappings.\r\nNow the horses are called Nesaian for this reason:--there is a wide\r\nplain in the land of Media which is called the Nesaian plain, and this\r\nplain produces the great horses of which I speak. Behind these ten\r\nhorses the sacred chariot of Zeus was appointed to go, which was drawn\r\nby eight white horses; and behind the horses again followed on foot a\r\ncharioteer holding the reins, for no human creature mounts upon the seat\r\nof that chariot. Then behind this came Xerxes himself in a chariot drawn\r\nby Nesaian horses, and by the side of him rode a charioteer, whose name\r\nwas Patiramphes, son of Otanes a Persian.\r\n\r\n41. Thus did Xerxes march forth out of Sardis; and he used to change,\r\nwhenever he was so disposed, from the chariot to a carriage. And behind\r\nhim went spearmen, the best and most noble of the Persians, a thousand\r\nin number, holding their spear-points in the customary way; 42 and after\r\nthem another thousand horsemen chosen out from the Persians; and after\r\nthe horsemen ten thousand men chosen out from the remainder of the\r\nPersians. This body went on foot; and of these a thousand had upon their\r\nspears pomegranates of gold instead of the spikes at the butt-end, and\r\nthese enclosed the others round, while the remaining nine thousand were\r\nwithin these and had silver pomegranates. And those also had golden\r\npomegranates who had their spear-points turned towards the earth, while\r\nthose who followed next after Xerxes had golden apples. Then to follow\r\nthe ten thousand there was appointed a body of ten thousand Persian\r\ncavalry; and after the cavalry there was an interval of as much as two\r\nfurlongs. Then the rest of the host came marching without distinction.\r\n\r\n42. So the army proceeded on its march from Lydia to the river Caïcos\r\nand the land of Mysia; and then setting forth from the Caïcos and\r\nkeeping the mountain of Cane on the left hand, it marched through the\r\nregion of Atarneus to the city of Carene. From this it went through the\r\nplain of Thebe, passing by the cities of Adramytteion and Antandros of\r\nthe Pelasgians; and taking mount Ida on the left hand, it came on to the\r\nland of Ilion. And first, when it had stopped for the night close under\r\nmount Ida, thunder and bolts of lightning fell upon it, and destroyed\r\nhere in this place a very large number of men. 43\r\n\r\n43. Then when the army had come to the river Scamander,--which of all\r\nrivers to which they had come, since they set forth from Sardis and\r\nundertook their march, was the first of which the stream failed and\r\nwas not sufficient for the drinking of the army and of the animals\r\nwith it,--when, I say, Xerxes had come to this river, he went up to the\r\nCitadel of Priam, 44 having a desire to see it; and having seen it\r\nand learnt by inquiry of all those matters severally, he sacrificed a\r\nthousand heifers to Athene of Ilion, and the Magians poured libations in\r\nhonour of the heroes: and after they had done this, a fear fell upon\r\nthe army in the night. Then at break of day he set forth from thence,\r\nkeeping on his left hand the cities of Rhoition and Ophryneion and\r\nDardanos, which last borders upon Abydos, and having on the right hand\r\nthe Gergith Teucrians.\r\n\r\n44. When Xerxes had come into the midst of Abydos, 45 he had a desire to\r\nsee all the army; and there had been made purposely for him beforehand\r\nupon a hill in this place a raised seat of white stone, 46 which the\r\npeople of Abydos had built at the command of the king given beforehand.\r\nThere he took his seat, and looking down upon the shore he gazed both\r\nupon the land-army and the ships; and gazing upon them he had a longing\r\nto see a contest take place between the ships; and when it had taken\r\nplace and the Phenicians of Sidon were victorious, he was delighted both\r\nwith the contest and with the whole armament.\r\n\r\n45. And seeing all the Hellespont covered over with the ships, and all\r\nthe shores and the plains of Abydos full of men, then Xerxes pronounced\r\nhimself a happy man, and after that he fell to weeping.\r\n\r\n46. Artabanos his uncle therefore perceiving him,--the same who at\r\nfirst boldly declared his opinion advising Xerxes not to march against\r\nHellas,--this man, I say, having observed that Xerxes wept, asked as\r\nfollows: \"O king, how far different from one another are the things\r\nwhich thou hast done now and a short while before now! for having\r\npronounced thyself a happy man, thou art now shedding tears.\" He said:\r\n\"Yea, for after I had reckoned up, it came into my mind to feel pity at\r\nthe thought how brief was the whole life of man, seeing that of these\r\nmultitudes not one will be alive when a hundred years have gone by.\" He\r\nthen made answer and said: \"To another evil more pitiful than this we\r\nare made subject in the course of our life; for in the period of life,\r\nshort as it is, no man, either of these here or of others, is made by\r\nnature so happy, that there will not come to him many times, and not\r\nonce only, the desire to be dead rather than to live; for misfortunes\r\nfalling upon us and diseases disturbing our happiness make the time\r\nof life, though short indeed, seem long: thus, since life is full of\r\ntrouble, death has become the most acceptable refuge for man; and God,\r\nhaving given him to taste of the sweetness of life, is discovered in\r\nthis matter to be full of jealousy.\"\r\n\r\n47. Xerxes made answer saying: \"Artabanos, of human life, which is such\r\nas thou dost define it to be, let us cease to speak, and do not remember\r\nevils when we have good things in hand: but do thou declare to me\r\nthis:--If the vision of the dream had not appeared with so much\r\nevidence, wouldest thou still be holding thy former opinion,\r\nendeavouring to prevent me from marching against Hellas, or wouldest\r\nthou have changed from it? Come, tell me this exactly.\" He answered\r\nsaying: \"O king, may the vision of the dream which appeared have such\r\nfulfilment as we both desire! but I am even to this moment full of\r\napprehension and cannot contain myself, taking into account many things\r\nbesides, and also seeing that two things, which are the greatest things\r\nof all, are utterly hostile to thee.\"\r\n\r\n48. To this Xerxes made answer in these words: \"Thou strangest of men,\r\n47 of what nature are these two things which thou sayest are utterly\r\nhostile to me? Is it that the land-army is to be found fault with in\r\nthe matter of numbers, and that the army of the Hellenes appears to thee\r\nlikely to be many times as large as ours? or dost thou think that our\r\nfleet will fall short of theirs? or even that both of these things\r\ntogether will prove true? For if thou thinkest that in these respects\r\nour power is deficient, one might make gathering at once of another\r\nforce.\"\r\n\r\n49. Then he made answer and said: \"O king, neither with this army would\r\nany one who has understanding find fault, nor with the number of the\r\nships; and indeed if thou shalt assemble more, the two things of which\r\nI speak will be made thereby yet more hostile: and these two things\r\nare--the land and the sea. For neither in the sea is there, as I\r\nsuppose, a harbour anywhere large enough to receive this fleet of thine,\r\nif a storm should arise, and to ensure the safety of the ships till it\r\nbe over; and yet not one alone 48 ought this harbour to be, but there\r\nshould be such harbours along the whole coast of the continent by which\r\nthou sailest; and if there are not harbours to receive thy ships, know\r\nthat accidents will rule men and not men the accidents. Now having told\r\nthee of one of the two things, I am about to tell thee of the other. The\r\nland, I say, becomes hostile to thee in this way:--if nothing shall\r\ncome to oppose thee, the land is hostile to thee by so much the more\r\nin proportion as thou shalt advance more, ever stealing on further and\r\nfurther, 49 for there is no satiety of good fortune felt by men:\r\nand this I say, that with no one to stand against thee the country\r\ntraversed, growing more and more as time goes on, will produce for\r\nthee famine. Man, however, will be in the best condition, if when he is\r\ntaking counsel he feels fear, reckoning to suffer everything that can\r\npossibly come, but in doing the deed he is bold.\"\r\n\r\n50. Xerxes made answer in these words: \"Artabanos, reasonably dost thou\r\nset forth these matters; but do not thou fear everything nor reckon\r\nequally for everything: for if thou shouldest set thyself with regard to\r\nall matters which come on at any time, to reckon for everything equally,\r\nthou wouldest never perform any deed. It is better to have good courage\r\nabout everything and to suffer half the evils which threaten, than to\r\nhave fear beforehand about everything and not to suffer any evil at all:\r\nand if, while contending against everything which is said, thou omit to\r\ndeclare the course which is safe, thou dost incur in these matters the\r\nreproach of failure equally with him who says the opposite to this. This\r\nthen, I say, is evenly balanced: but how should one who is but man know\r\nthe course which is safe? I think, in no way. To those then who choose\r\nto act, for the most part gain is wont to come; but to those who reckon\r\nfor everything and shrink back, it is not much wont to come. Thou seest\r\nthe power of the Persians, to what great might it has advanced: if then\r\nthose who came to be kings before me had had opinions like to thine, or,\r\nthough not having such opinions, had had such counsellors as thou, thou\r\nwouldest never have seen it brought forward to this point. As it is\r\nhowever, by running risks they conducted it on to this: for great power\r\nis in general gained by running great risks. We therefore, following\r\ntheir example, are making our march now during the fairest season of the\r\nyear; and after we have subdued all Europe we shall return back home,\r\nneither having met with famine anywhere nor having suffered any other\r\nthing which is unpleasant. For first we march bearing with us ourselves\r\ngreat store of food, and secondly we shall possess the corn-crops of all\r\nthe peoples to whose land and nation we come; and we are making a march\r\nnow against men who plough the soil, and not against nomad tribes.\"\r\n\r\n51. After this Artabanos said: \"O king, since thou dost urge us not to\r\nhave fear of anything, do thou I pray thee accept a counsel from me;\r\nfor when speaking of many things it is necessary to extend speech to a\r\ngreater length. Cyrus the son of Cambyses subdued all Ionia except the\r\nAthenians, so that it was tributary to the Persians. These men therefore\r\nI counsel thee by no means to lead against their parent stock, seeing\r\nthat even without these we are able to get the advantage over our\r\nenemies. For supposing that they go with us, either they must prove\r\nthemselves doers of great wrong, if they join in reducing their mother\r\ncity to slavery, or doers of great right, if they join in freeing her:\r\nnow if they show themselves doers of great wrong, they bring us no\r\nvery large gain in addition; but if they show themselves doers of great\r\nright, they are able then to cause much damage to thy army. Therefore\r\nlay to heart also the ancient saying, how well it has been said that at\r\nthe first beginning of things the end does not completely appear.\"\r\n\r\n52. To this Xerxes made answer: \"Artabanos, of all the opinions which\r\nthou hast uttered, thou art mistaken most of all in this; seeing that\r\nthou fearest lest the Ionians should change side, about whom we have a\r\nmost sure proof, of which thou art a witness thyself and also the\r\nrest are witnesses who went with Dareios on his march against the\r\nScythians,--namely this, that the whole Persian army then came to be\r\ndependent upon these men, whether they would destroy or whether they\r\nwould save it, and they displayed righteous dealing and trustworthiness,\r\nand nought at all that was unfriendly. Besides this, seeing that they\r\nhave left children and wives and wealth in our land, we must not even\r\nimagine that they will make any rebellion. 50 Fear not then this thing\r\neither, but have a good heart and keep safe my house and my government;\r\nfor to thee of all men I entrust my sceptre of rule.\"\r\n\r\n53. Having thus spoken and having sent Artabanos back to Susa, next\r\nXerxes summoned to his presence the men of most repute among the\r\nPersians, and when they were come before him, he spoke to them as\r\nfollows: \"Persians, I assembled you together desiring this of you, that\r\nye should show yourselves good men and should not disgrace the deeds\r\ndone in former times by the Persians, which are great and glorious; but\r\nlet us each one of us by himself, and all together also, be zealous in\r\nour enterprise; for this which we labour for is a common good for all.\r\nAnd I exhort you that ye preserve in the war without relaxing your\r\nefforts, because, as I am informed, we are marching against good men,\r\nand if we shall overcome them, there will not be any other army of\r\nmen which will ever stand against us. Now therefore let us begin the\r\ncrossing, after having made prayer to those gods who have the Persians\r\n51 for their allotted charge.\"\r\n\r\n54. During this day then they were making preparation to cross over; and\r\non the next day they waited for the Sun, desiring to see him rise, and\r\nin the meantime they offered all kinds of incense upon the bridges and\r\nstrewed the way with branches of myrtle. Then, as the Sun was rising,\r\nXerxes made libation from a golden cup into the sea, and prayed to the\r\nSun, that no accident might befall him such as should cause him to cease\r\nfrom subduing Europe, until he had come to its furthest limits. After\r\nhaving thus prayed he threw the cup into the Hellespont and with it a\r\ngolden mixing-bowl and a Persian sword, which they call akinakes: but\r\nwhether he cast them into the sea as an offering dedicated to the\r\nSun, or whether he had repented of his scourging of the Hellespont and\r\ndesired to present a gift to the sea as amends for this, I cannot for\r\ncertain say.\r\n\r\n55. When Xerxes had done this, they proceeded to cross over, the whole\r\narmy both the footmen and the horsemen going by one bridge, namely that\r\nwhich was on the side of the Pontus, while the baggage-animals and the\r\nattendants went over the other, which was towards the Egean. First the\r\nten thousand Persians led the way, all with wreaths, and after them came\r\nthe mixed body of the army made up of all kinds of nations: these on\r\nthat day; and on the next day, first the horsemen and those who had\r\ntheir spear-points turned downwards, these also wearing wreaths; and\r\nafter them the sacred horses and the sacred chariot, and then Xerxes\r\nhimself and the spear-bearers and the thousand horsemen; and after them\r\nthe rest of the army. In the meantime the ships also put out from shore\r\nand went over to the opposite side. I have heard however another account\r\nwhich says that the king crossed over the very last of all.\r\n\r\n56. When Xerxes had crossed over into Europe, he gazed upon the army\r\ncrossing under the lash; and his army crossed over in seven days and\r\nseven nights, going on continuously without any pause. Then, it is said,\r\nafter Xerxes had now crossed over the Hellespont, a man of that coast\r\nexclaimed: \"Why, O Zeus, in the likeness of a Persian man and taking for\r\nthyself the name of Xerxes instead of Zeus, art thou proposing to\r\nlay waste Hellas, taking with thee all the nations of men? for it was\r\npossible for thee to do so even without the help of these.\"\r\n\r\n57. When all had crossed over, after they had set forth on their way\r\na great portent appeared to them, of which Xerxes made no account,\r\nalthough it was easy to conjecture its meaning,--a mare gave birth to a\r\nhare. Now the meaning of this was easy to conjecture in this way, namely\r\nthat Xerxes was about to march an army against Hellas very proudly and\r\nmagnificently, but would come back again to the place whence he came,\r\nrunning for his life. There happened also a portent of another kind\r\nwhile he was still at Sardis,--a mule brought forth young and gave birth\r\nto a mule which had organs of generation of two kinds, both those of the\r\nmale and those of the female, and those of the male were above. Xerxes\r\nhowever made no account of either of these portents, but proceeded on\r\nhis way, and with him the land-army.\r\n\r\n58. The fleet meanwhile was sailing out of the Hellespont and coasting\r\nalong, going in the opposite direction to the land-army; for the fleet\r\nwas sailing towards the West, making for the promontory of Sarpedon, to\r\nwhich it had been ordered beforehand to go, and there wait for the army;\r\nbut the land-army meanwhile was making its march towards the East and\r\nthe sunrising, through the Chersonese, keeping on its right the tomb of\r\nHelle the daughter of Athamas, and on its left the city of Cardia, and\r\nmarching through the midst of a town the name of which is Agora. 52\r\nThence bending round the gulf called Melas and having crossed over the\r\nriver Melas, the stream of which did not suffice at this time for the\r\narmy but failed,--having crossed, I say, this river, from which the gulf\r\nalso has its name, it went on Westwards, passing by Ainos a city of the\r\nAiolians, and by the lake Stentoris, until at last it came to Doriscos.\r\n\r\n59. Now Doriscos is a sea-beach and plain of great extent in Thrace, and\r\nthrough it flows the great river Hebros: here a royal fortress had been\r\nbuilt, the same which is now called Doriscos, and a garrison of Persians\r\nhad been established in it by Dareios, ever since the time when he went\r\non his march against the Scythians. It seemed then to Xerxes that the\r\nplace was convenient to order his army and to number it throughout, and\r\nso he proceeded to do. The commanders of the ships at the bidding of\r\nXerxes had brought all their ships, when they arrived at Doriscos, up\r\nto the sea-beach which adjoins Doriscos, on which there is situated\r\nboth Sale a city of the Samothrakians, and also Zone, and of which the\r\nextreme point is the promontory of Serreion, which is well known; and\r\nthe region belonged in ancient time to the Kikonians. To this beach then\r\nthey had brought in their ships, and having drawn them up on land they\r\nwere letting them get dry: and during this time he proceeded to number\r\nthe army at Doriscos.\r\n\r\n60. Now of the number which each separate nation supplied I am not able\r\nto give certain information, for this is not reported by any persons;\r\nbut of the whole land-army taken together the number proved to be one\r\nhundred and seventy myriads: 53 and they numbered them throughout in\r\nthe following manner:--they gathered together in one place a body of\r\nten thousand men, and packing them together 54 as closely as they could,\r\nthey drew a circle round outside: and thus having drawn a circle round\r\nand having let the ten thousand men go from it, they built a wall of\r\nrough stones round the circumference of the circle, rising to the height\r\nof a man's navel. Having made this, they caused others to go into the\r\nspace which had been built round, until they had in this manner numbered\r\nthem all throughout: and after they had numbered them, they ordered them\r\nseparately by nations.\r\n\r\n61. Now those who served were as follows:--The Persians with this\r\nequipment:--about their heads they had soft 55 felt caps called tiaras,\r\nand about their body tunics of various colours with sleeves, presenting\r\nthe appearance of iron scales like those of a fish, 56 and about the\r\nlegs trousers; and instead of the ordinary shields they had shields of\r\nwicker-work, 57 under which hung quivers; and they had short spears and\r\nlarge bows and arrows of reed, and moreover daggers hanging by the right\r\nthigh from the girdle: and they acknowledged as their commander Otanes\r\nthe father of Amestris the wife of Xerxes. Now these were called by the\r\nHellenes in ancient time Kephenes; by themselves however and by their\r\nneighbours they were called Artaians: but when Perseus, the son of\r\nDanae and Zeus, came to Kepheus the son of Belos 58 and took to wife\r\nhis daughter Andromeda, there was born to them a son to whom he gave\r\nthe name Perses, and this son he left behind there, for it chanced that\r\nKepheus had no male offspring: after him therefore this race was named.\r\n\r\n62. The Medes served in the expedition equipped in precisely the same\r\nmanner; for this equipment is in fact Median and not Persian: and the\r\nMedes acknowledged as their commander Tigranes an Achaimenid. These\r\nin ancient time used to be generally called Arians; but when Medea the\r\nColchian came from Athens to these Arians, they also changed their name.\r\nThus the Medes themselves report about themselves. The Kissians served\r\nwith equipment in other respects like that of the Persians, but instead\r\nof the felt caps they wore fillets: 59and of the Kissians Anaphes\r\nthe son of Otanes was commander. The Hyrcanians were armed like the\r\nPersians, acknowledging as their leader Megapanos, the same who after\r\nthese events became governor of Babylon.\r\n\r\n63. The Assyrians served with helmets about their heads made of bronze\r\nor plaited in a Barbarian style which it is not easy to describe; and\r\nthey had shields and spears, and daggers like the Egyptian knives, 60\r\nand moreover they had wooden clubs with knobs of iron, and corslets of\r\nlinen. These are by the Hellenes called Syrians, but by the Barbarians\r\nthey have been called always 61 Assyrians: [among these were the\r\nChaldeans]: 62 and the commander of them was Otaspes the son of\r\nArtachaies.\r\n\r\n64. The Bactrians served wearing about their heads nearly the same\r\ncovering as the Medes, and having native bows of reed and short spears.\r\nThe Scaran Scythians had about their heads caps 63 which were carried\r\nup to a point and set upright and stiff; and they wore trousers, and\r\ncarried native bows and daggers, and besides this axes of the kind\r\ncalled sagaris. These were called Amyrgian Sacans, being in fact\r\nScythians; for the Persians call all the Scythians Sacans: and of the\r\nBactrians and Sacans the commander was Hystaspes, the son of Dareios and\r\nof Atossa the daughter of Cyrus.\r\n\r\n65. The Indians wore garments made of tree-wool, and they had bows\r\nof reed and arrows of reed with iron points. Thus were the Indians\r\nequipped; and serving with the rest they had been assigned to\r\nPharnazathres the son of Artabates.\r\n\r\n66. The Arians 64 were equipped with Median bows, and in other respects\r\nlike the Bactrians: and of the Arians Sisamnes the son of Hydarnes was\r\nin command. The Parthians and Chorasmians and Sogdians and Gandarians\r\nand Dadicans served with the same equipment as the Bactrians. Of these\r\nthe commanders were, Artabazos the son of Pharnakes of the Parthians and\r\nChorasmians, Azanes the son of Artaios of the Sogdians, and Artyphios\r\nthe son of Artabanos of the Gandarians and Dadicans. The Caspians\r\nserved wearing coats of skin 65 and having native bows of reed and short\r\nswords: 66 thus were these equipped; and they acknowledged as their\r\nleader Ariomardos the brother of Artyphios. The Sarangians were\r\nconspicuous among the rest by wearing dyed garments; and they had\r\nboots reaching up to the knee, and Median bows and spears: of these\r\nthe commander was Pherendates the son of Megabazos. The Pactyans\r\nwere wearers of skin coats 67 and had native bows and daggers: these\r\nacknowledged as their commander Artaÿntes the son of Ithamitres.\r\n\r\n68. The Utians and Mycans and Paricanians were equipped like the\r\nPactyans: of these the commanders were, Arsamenes the son of Dareios\r\nof the Utians and Mycans, and of the Paricanians Siromitres the son of\r\nOiobazos.\r\n\r\n69. The Arabians wore loose mantles 68 girt up, and they carried\r\nat their right side bows that bent backward 69 of great length. The\r\nEthiopians had skins of leopards and lions tied upon them, and bows made\r\nof a slip 70 of palm-wood, which were of great length, not less than\r\nfour cubits, and for them small arrows of reed with a sharpened stone at\r\nthe head instead of iron, the same stone with which they engrave seals:\r\nin addition to this they had spears, and on them was the sharpened horn\r\nof a gazelle by way of a spear-head, and they had also clubs with knobs\r\nupon them. Of their body they used to smear over half with white, 71\r\nwhen they went into battle, and the other half with red. 72 Of the\r\nArabians and the Ethiopians who dwelt above Egypt the commander was\r\nArsames, the son of Dareios and of Artystone, the daughter of Cyrus,\r\nwhom Dareios loved most of all his wives, and had an image made of her\r\nof beaten gold.\r\n\r\n70. Of the Ethiopians above Egypt and of the Arabians the commander, I\r\nsay, was Arsames; but the Ethiopians from the direction of the sunrising\r\n(for the Ethiopians were in two bodies) had been appointed to serve with\r\nthe Indians, being in no way different from the other Ethiopians, but in\r\ntheir language and in the nature of their hair only; for the Ethiopians\r\nfrom the East are straight-haired, but those of Libya have hair more\r\nthick and woolly than that of any other men. These Ethiopians from Asia\r\nwere armed for the most part like the Indians, but they had upon their\r\nheads the skin of a horse's forehead flayed off with the ears and the\r\nmane, and the mane served instead of a crest, while they had the ears of\r\nthe horse set up straight and stiff: and instead of shields they used to\r\nmake defences to hold before themselves of the skins of cranes.\r\n\r\n71. The Libyans went with equipments of leather, and they used javelins\r\nburnt at the point. These acknowledged as their commander Massages the\r\nson of Oarizos.\r\n\r\n72. The Paphlagonians served with plaited helmets upon their heads,\r\nsmall shields, and spears of no great size, and also javelins and\r\ndaggers; and about their feet native boots reaching up to the middle of\r\nthe shin. The Ligyans and Matienians and Mariandynoi and Syrians served\r\nwith the same equipment as the Paphlagonians: these Syrians are called\r\nby the Persians Cappadokians. Of the Paphlagonians and Matienians the\r\ncommander was Dotos the son of Megasidros, and of the Mariandynoi and\r\nLygians and Syrians, Gobryas, who was the son of Dareios and Artystone.\r\n\r\n73. The Phrygians had an equipment very like that of the Paphlagonians\r\nwith some slight difference. Now the Phrygians, as the Macedonians say,\r\nused to be called Brigians during the time that they were natives of\r\nEurope and dwelt with the Macedonians; but after they had changed into\r\nAsia, with their country they changed also their name and were called\r\nPhrygians. The Armenians were armed just like the Phrygians, being\r\nsettlers from the Phrygians. Of these two together the commander was\r\nArtochmes, who was married to a daughter of Dareios.\r\n\r\n74. The Lydians had arms very closely resembling those of the Hellenes.\r\nNow the Lydians were in old time called Medonians, and they were named\r\nagain after Lydos the son of Atys, changing their former name. The\r\nMysians had upon their heads native helmets, and they bore small shields\r\nand used javelins burnt at the point. These are settlers from the\r\nLydians, and from mount Olympos they are called Olympienoi. Of\r\nthe Lydians and Mysians the commander was Artaphrenes the son of\r\nArtaphrenes, he who invaded Marathon together with Datis.\r\n\r\n75. The Thracians served having fox-skins upon their heads and tunics\r\nabout their body, with loose mantles of various colours thrown round\r\nover them; and about their feet and lower part of the leg they wore\r\nboots of deer-skin; and besides this they had javelins and round\r\nbucklers and small daggers. These when they had crossed over into Asia\r\ncame to be called Bithynians, but formerly they were called, as they\r\nthemselves report, Strymonians, since they dwelt upon the river Strymon;\r\nand they say that they were driven out of their abode by the Teucrians\r\nand Mysians. Of the Thracians who lived in Asia the commander was\r\nBassakes the son of Artabanos.\r\n\r\n76.... 73 and they had small shields of raw ox-hide, and each man\r\ncarried two hunting-spears of Lykian workmanship. 74 On their heads they\r\nwore helmets of bronze, and to the helmets the ears and horns of an ox\r\nwere attached, in bronze, and upon them also there were crests; and the\r\nlower part of their legs was wrapped round with red-coloured strips of\r\ncloth. Among these men there is an Oracle of Ares.\r\n\r\n77. The Meonian Cabelians, who are called Lasonians, had the same\r\nequipment as the Kilikians, and what this was I shall explain when in\r\nthe course of the catalogue I come to the array of the Kilikians. The\r\nMilyans had short spears, and their garments were fastened on with\r\nbuckles; some of them had Lykian bows, and about their heads they had\r\ncaps made of leather. Of all these Badres the son of Hystanes was in\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n78. The Moschoi had wooden caps upon their heads, and shields and small\r\nspears, on which long points were set. The Tibarenians and Macronians\r\nand Mossynoicoi served with equipment like that of the Moschoi, and\r\nthese were arrayed together under the following commanders,--the Moschoi\r\nand Tibarenians under Ariomardos, who was the son of Dareios and\r\nof Parmys, the daughter of Smerdis son of Cyrus; the Macronians and\r\nMossynoicoi under Artaÿctes the son of Cherasmis, who was governor of\r\nSestos on the Hellespont.\r\n\r\n79. The Mares wore on their heads native helmets of plaited work, and\r\nhad small shields of hide and javelins; and the Colchians wore wooden\r\nhelmets about their heads, and had small shields of raw ox-hide and\r\nshort spears, and also knives. Of the Mares and Colchians the commander\r\nwas Pharandates the son of Teaspis. The Alarodians and Saspeirians\r\nserved armed like the Colchians; and of these the commander was\r\nMasistios the son of Siromitres.\r\n\r\n80. The island tribes which came with the army from the Erythraian Sea,\r\nbelonging to the islands in which the king settles those who are called\r\nthe \"Removed,\" 75 had clothing and arms very like those of the Medes. Of\r\nthese islanders the commander was Mardontes the son of Bagaios, who in\r\nthe year after these events was a commander of the army at Mykale and\r\nlost his life in the battle.\r\n\r\n81. These were the nations which served in the campaign by land and had\r\nbeen appointed to be among the foot-soldiers. Of this army those who\r\nhave been mentioned were commanders; and they were the men who sit it in\r\norder by divisions and numbered it and appointed commanders of thousands\r\nand commanders of tens of thousands, but the commanders of hundreds and\r\nof tens were appointed by the commanders of ten thousands; and there\r\nwere others who were leaders of divisions and nations.\r\n\r\n82. These, I say, who have been mentioned were commanders of the army;\r\nand over these and over the whole army together that went on foot there\r\nwere in command Mardonios the son of Gobryas, Tritantaichmes the son of\r\nthat Artabanos who gave the opinion that they should not make the march\r\nagainst Hellas, Smerdomenes the son of Otanes (both these being sons of\r\nbrothers of Dareios and so cousins of Xerxes), 76 Masistes the son of\r\nDareios and Atossa, Gergis the son of Ariazos, and Megabyzos the son of\r\nZopyros.\r\n\r\n83. These were generals of the whole together that went on foot,\r\nexcepting the ten thousand; and of these ten thousand chosen Persians\r\nthe general was Hydarnes the son of Hydarnes; and these Persians\r\nwere called \"Immortals,\" because, if any one of them made the number\r\nincomplete, being overcome either by death or disease, another man was\r\nchosen to his place, and they were never either more or fewer than\r\nten thousand. Now of all the nations, the Persians showed the greatest\r\nsplendour of ornament and were themselves the best men. They had\r\nequipment such as has been mentioned, and besides this they were\r\nconspicuous among the rest for great quantity of gold freely used; and\r\nthey took with them carriages, and in them concubines and a multitude\r\nof attendants well furnished; and provisions for them apart from the\r\nsoldiers were borne by camels and beasts of burden.\r\n\r\n84. The nations who serve as cavalry are these; not all however supplied\r\ncavalry, but only as many as here follow:--the Persians equipped in the\r\nsame manner as their foot-soldiers, except that upon their heads some of\r\nthem had beaten-work of metal, either bronze or iron.\r\n\r\n85. There are also certain nomads called Sagartians, Persian in race\r\nand in language and having a dress which is midway between that of the\r\nPersians and that of the Pactyans. These furnished eight thousand horse,\r\nand they are not accustomed to have any arms either of bronze or of iron\r\nexcepting daggers, but they use ropes twisted of thongs, and trust to\r\nthese when they go into war: and the manner of fighting of these men is\r\nas follows:--when they come to conflict with the enemy, they throw the\r\nropes with nooses at the end of them, and whatsoever the man catches by\r\nthe throw, 77 whether horse or man, he draws to himself, and they being\r\nentangled in toils are thus destroyed.\r\n\r\n86. This is the manner of fighting of these men, and they were arrayed\r\nnext to the Persians. The Medes had the same equipment as their men\r\non foot, and the Kissians likewise. The Indians were armed in the same\r\nmanner as those of them who served on foot, and they both rode horses\r\n78 and drove chariots, in which were harnessed horses or wild asses. The\r\nBactrians were equipped in the same way as those who served on foot,\r\nand the Caspians likewise. The Libyans too were equipped like those who\r\nserved on foot, and these also all drove chariots. So too the Caspians\r\n79 and Paricanians were equipped like those who served on foot, and they\r\nall rode on camels, which in swiftness were not inferior to horses.\r\n\r\n87. These nations alone served 80 as cavalry, and the number of the\r\ncavalry proved to be eight myriads, 81 apart from the camels and the\r\nchariots. Now the rest of the cavalry was arrayed in squadrons, but the\r\nArabians were placed after them and last of all, for the horses could\r\nnot endure the camels, and therefore they were placed last, in order\r\nthat the horses might not be frightened.\r\n\r\n88. The commanders of the cavalry were Harmamithras and Tithaios sons of\r\nDatis, but the third, Pharnuches, who was in command of the horse with\r\nthem, had been left behind at Sardis sick: for as they were setting\r\nforth from Sardis, an accident befell him of an unwished-for kind,--as\r\nhe was riding, a dog ran up under his horse's feet, and the horse\r\nnot having seen it beforehand was frightened, and rearing up he threw\r\nPharnuches off his back, who falling vomited blood, and his sickness\r\nturned to a consumption. To the horse however they forthwith at the\r\nfirst did as he commanded, that is to say, the servants led him away\r\nto the place where he had thrown his master and cut off his legs at the\r\nknees. Thus was Pharnuches removed from his command.\r\n\r\n89. Of the triremes the number proved to be one thousand two hundred and\r\nseven, and these were they who furnished them:--the Phenicians, together\r\nwith the Syrians 82 who dwell in Palestine furnished three hundred;\r\nand they were equipped thus, that is to say, they had about their heads\r\nleathern caps made very nearly in the Hellenic fashion, and they wore\r\ncorslets of linen, and had shields without rims and javelins. These\r\nPhenicians dwelt in ancient time, as they themselves report, upon the\r\nErythraian Sea, and thence they passed over and dwell in the country\r\nalong the sea coast of Syria; and this part of Syria and all as far as\r\nEgypt is called Palestine. The Egyptians furnished two hundred ships:\r\nthese men had about their heads helmets of plaited work, and they had\r\nhollow shields with the rims large, and spears for sea-fighting, and\r\nlarge axes: 83 the greater number of them wore corslets, and they had\r\nlarge knives.\r\n\r\n90. These men were thus equipped; and the Cyprians furnished a hundred\r\nand fifty ships, being themselves equipped as follows,--their kings had\r\ntheir heads wound round with fillets, 84 and the rest had tunics, 85\r\nbut in other respects they were like the Hellenes. Among these there\r\nare various races as follows,--some of them are from Salamis and Athens,\r\nothers from Arcadia, others from Kythnos, others again from Phenicia and\r\nothers from Ethiopia, as the Cyprians themselves report.\r\n\r\n91. The Kilikians furnished a hundred ships; and these again had about\r\ntheir heads native helmets, and for shields they carried targets made of\r\nraw ox-hide: they wore tunics 86 of wool and each man had two javelins\r\nand a sword, this last being made very like the Egyptian knives. These\r\nin old time were called Hypachaians, and they got their later name from\r\nKilix the son of Agenor, a Phenician. The Pamphylians furnished thirty\r\nships and were equipped in Hellenic arms. These Pamphylians are of those\r\nwho were dispersed from Troy together with Amphilochos and Calchas.\r\n\r\n92. The Lykians furnished fifty ships; and they were wearers of corslets\r\nand greaves, and had bows of cornel-wood and arrows of reeds without\r\nfeathers and javelins and a goat-skin hanging over their shoulders, and\r\nabout their heads felt caps wreathed round with feathers; also they had\r\ndaggers and falchions. 87 The Lykians were formerly called Termilai,\r\nbeing originally of Crete, and they got their later name from Lycos the\r\nson of Pandion, an Athenian.\r\n\r\n93. The Dorians of Asia furnished thirty ships; and these had Hellenic\r\narms and were originally from the Peloponnese. The Carians supplied\r\nseventy ships; and they were equipped in other respects like Hellenes\r\nbut they had also falchions and daggers. What was the former name of\r\nthese has been told in the first part of the history. 88\r\n\r\n94. The Ionians furnished a hundred ships, and were equipped\r\nlike Hellenes. Now the Ionians, so long time as they dwelt in the\r\nPeloponnese, in the land which is now called Achaia, and before the\r\ntime when Danaos and Xuthos came to the Peloponnese, were called, as the\r\nHellenes report, Pelasgians of the Coast-land, 89 and then Ionians after\r\nIon the son of Xuthos.\r\n\r\n95. The islanders furnished seventeen ships, and were armed like\r\nHellenes, this also being a Pelasgian race, though afterwards it came to\r\nbe called Ionian by the same rule as the Ionians of the twelve cities,\r\nwho came from Athens. The Aiolians supplied sixty ships; and these were\r\nequipped like Hellenes and used to be called Pelasgians in the old time,\r\nas the Hellenes report. The Hellespontians, excepting those of Abydos\r\n(for the men of Abydos had been appointed by the king to stay in their\r\nplace and be guards of the bridges), the rest, I say, of those who\r\nserved in the expedition from the Pontus furnished a hundred ships,\r\nand were equipped like Hellenes: these are colonists of the Ionians and\r\nDorians.\r\n\r\n96. In all the ships there served as fighting-men Persians, Medes, or\r\nSacans;: and of the ships, those which sailed best were furnished by the\r\nPhenicians, and of the Phenicians the best by the men of Sidon. Over all\r\nthese men and also over those of them who were appointed to serve in the\r\nland-army, there were for each tribe native chieftains, of whom, since I\r\nam not compelled by the course of the inquiry, I make no mention by the\r\nway; for in the first place the chieftains of each separate nation were\r\nnot persons worthy of mention, and then moreover within each nation\r\nthere were as many chieftains as there were cities. These went with the\r\nexpedition too not as commanders, but like the others serving as slaves;\r\nfor the generals who had the absolute power and commanded the various\r\nnations, that is to say those who were Persians, having already been\r\nmentioned by me.\r\n\r\n97. Of the naval force the following were commanders,--Ariabignes the\r\nson of Dareios, Prexaspes the son of Aspathines, Megabazos the son of\r\nMegabates, and Achaimenes the son of Dareios; that is to say, of the\r\nIonian and Carian force Ariabignes, who was the son of Dareios and of\r\nthe daughter of Gobryas; of the Egyptians Achaimenes was commander,\r\nbeing brother of Xerxes by both parents; and of the rest of the armament\r\nthe other two were in command: and galleys of thirty oars and of fifty\r\noars, and light vessels, 90 and long 91 ships to carry horses had been\r\nassembled together, as it proved, to the number of three thousand.\r\n\r\n98. Of those who sailed in the ships the men of most note after the\r\ncommanders were these,--of Sidon, Tetramnestos son of Anysos; of\r\nTyre, Matten 92 son of Siromos; or Arados, Merbalos son of Agbalos; of\r\nKilikia, Syennesis son of Oromedon; of Lykia, Kyberniscos son of Sicas;\r\nof Cyprus, Gorgos son of Chersis and Timonax son of Timagoras; of Caria,\r\nHistiaios son of Tymnes, Pigres son of Hysseldomos, 93 and Damasithymos\r\nson of Candaules.\r\n\r\n99. Of the rest of the officers I make no mention by the way (since I am\r\nnot bound to do so), but only of Artemisia, at whom I marvel most that\r\nshe joined the expedition against Hellas, being a woman; for after her\r\nhusband died, she holding the power herself, although she had a son\r\nwho was a young man, went on the expedition impelled by high spirit\r\nand manly courage, no necessity being laid upon her. Now her name, as I\r\nsaid, was Artemisia and she was the daughter of Lygdamis, and by descent\r\nshe was of Halicarnassos on the side of her father, but of Crete by her\r\nmother. She was ruler of the men of Halicarnassos and Cos and Nisyros\r\nand Calydna, furnishing five ships; and she furnished ships which were\r\nof all the fleet reputed the best after those of the Sidonians, and\r\nof all his allies she set forth the best counsels to the king. Of the\r\nStates of which I said that she was leader I declare the people to be\r\nall of Dorian race, those of Halicarnassos being Troizenians, and the\r\nrest Epidaurians. So far then I have spoken of the naval force.\r\n\r\n100. Then when Xerxes had numbered the army, and it had been arranged in\r\ndivisions, he had a mind to drive through it himself and inspect it: and\r\nafterwards he proceeded so to do; and driving through in a chariot\r\nby each nation, he inquired about them and his scribes wrote down the\r\nnames, until he had gone from end to end both of the horse and of the\r\nfoot. When he had done this, the ships were drawn down into the sea,\r\nand Xerxes changing from his chariot to a ship of Sidon sat down under a\r\ngolden canopy and sailed along by the prows of the ships, asking of all\r\njust as he had done with the land-army, and having the answers written\r\ndown. And the captains had taken their ships out to a distance of about\r\nfour hundred feet from the beach and were staying them there, all having\r\nturned the prows of the ships towards the shore in an even line 94 and\r\nhaving armed all the fighting-men as for war; and he inspected them\r\nsailing within, between the prows of the ships and the beach.\r\n\r\n101. Now when he had sailed through these and had disembarked from his\r\nship, he sent for Demaratos the son of Ariston, who was marching\r\nwith him against Hellas; and having called him he asked as follows:\r\n\"Demaratos, now it is my pleasure to ask thee somewhat which I desire\r\nto know. Thou art not only a Hellene, but also, as I am informed both\r\nby thee and by the other Hellenes who come to speech with me, of a city\r\nwhich is neither the least nor the feeblest of Hellas. Now therefore\r\ndeclare to me this, namely whether the Hellenes will endure to raise\r\nhands against me: for, as I suppose, even if all the Hellenes and\r\nthe remaining nations who dwell towards the West should be gathered\r\ntogether, they are not strong enough in fight to endure my attack,\r\nsupposing them to be my enemies. 95 I desire however to be informed also\r\nof thy opinion, what thou sayest about these matters.\" He inquired thus,\r\nand the other made answer and said: \"O king, shall I utter the truth\r\nin speaking to thee, or that which will give pleasure?\" and he bade\r\nhim utter the truth, saying that he should suffer nothing unpleasant in\r\nconsequence of this, any more than he suffered before.\r\n\r\n102. When Demaratos heard this, he spoke as follows: \"O king, since thou\r\nbiddest me by all means utter the truth, and so speak as one who shall\r\nnot be afterwards convicted by thee of having spoken falsely, I say\r\nthis:--with Hellas poverty is ever an inbred growth, while valour is one\r\nthat has been brought in, being acquired by intelligence and the force\r\nof law; and of it Hellas makes use ever to avert from herself not only\r\npoverty but also servitude to a master. Now I commend all the Hellenes\r\nwho are settled in those Dorian lands, but this which I am about to say\r\nhas regard not to all, but to the Lacedemonians alone: of these I say,\r\nfirst that it is not possible that they will ever accept thy terms,\r\nwhich carry with them servitude for Hellas; and next I say that they\r\nwill stand against thee in fight, even if all the other Hellenes shall\r\nbe of thy party: and as for numbers, ask now how many they are, that\r\nthey are able to do this; for whether it chances that a thousand of them\r\nhave come out into the field, these will fight with thee, or if there be\r\nless than this, or again if there be more.\"\r\n\r\n103. Xerxes hearing this laughed, and said: \"Demaratos, what a speech is\r\nthis which thou hast uttered, saying that a thousand men will fight with\r\nthis vast army! Come tell me this:--thou sayest that thou wert thyself\r\nking of these men; wilt thou therefore consent forthwith to fight with\r\nten men? and yet if your State is such throughout as thou dost describe\r\nit, thou their king ought by your laws to stand in array against double\r\nas many as another man; that is to say, if each of them is a match for\r\nten men of my army, I expect of thee that thou shouldest be a match for\r\ntwenty. Thus would be confirmed the report which is made by thee: but if\r\nye, who boast thus greatly are such men and in size so great only as\r\nthe Hellenes who come commonly to speech with me, thyself included, then\r\nbeware lest this which has been spoken prove but an empty vaunt. For\r\ncome, let me examine it by all that is probable: how could a thousand or\r\nten thousand or even fifty thousand, at least if they were all equally\r\nfree and were not ruled by one man, stand against so great an army?\r\nsince, as thou knowest, we shall be more than a thousand coming about\r\neach one of them, supposing them to be in number five thousand. If\r\nindeed they were ruled by one man after our fashion, they might perhaps\r\nfrom fear of him become braver than it was their nature to be, or they\r\nmight go compelled by the lash to fight with greater numbers, being\r\nthemselves fewer in number; but if left at liberty, they would do\r\nneither of these things: and I for my part suppose that, even if equally\r\nmatched in numbers, the Hellenes would hardly dare to fight with the\r\nPersians taken alone. With us however this of which thou speakest is\r\nfound in single men, 96 not indeed often, but rarely; for there are\r\nPersians of my spearmen who will consent to fight with three men of the\r\nHellenes at once: but thou hast had no experience of these things and\r\ntherefore thou speakest very much at random.\"\r\n\r\n104. To this Demaratos replied: \"O king, from the first I was sure that\r\nif I uttered the truth I should not speak that which was pleasing to\r\nthee; since however thou didst compel me to speak the very truth, I told\r\nthee of the matters which concern the Spartans. And yet how I am at this\r\npresent time attached to them by affection thou knowest better than any;\r\nseeing that first they took away from me the rank and privileges which\r\ncame to me from my fathers, and then also they have caused me to be\r\nwithout native land and an exile; but thy father took me up and gave\r\nme livelihood and a house to dwell in. Surely it is not to be supposed\r\nlikely that the prudent man will thrust aside friendliness which is\r\noffered to him, but rather that he will accept it with full contentment.\r\n97 And I do not profess that I am able to fight either with ten men or\r\nwith two, nay, if I had my will, I would not even fight with one; but if\r\nthere were necessity or if the cause which urged me to the combat were\r\na great one, I would fight most willingly with one of these men who says\r\nthat he is a match for three of the Hellenes. So also the Lacedemonians\r\nare not inferior to any men when fighting one by one, and they are the\r\nbest of all men when fighting in a body: for though free, yet they are\r\nnot free in all things, for over them is set Law as a master, whom they\r\nfear much more even than thy people fear thee. It is certain at least\r\nthat they do whatsoever that master commands; and he commands ever the\r\nsame thing, that is to say, he bids them not flee out of battle from\r\nany multitude of men, but stay in their post and win the victory or lose\r\ntheir life. But if when I say these things I seem to thee to be speaking\r\nat random, of other things for the future I prefer to be silent; and\r\nat this time I spake only because I was compelled. May it come to pass\r\nhowever according to thy mind, O king.\"\r\n\r\n105. He thus made answer, and Xerxes turned the matter to laughter\r\nand felt no anger, but dismissed him with kindness. Then after he had\r\nconversed with him, and had appointed Mascames son of Megadostes to\r\nbe governor at this place Doriscos, removing the governor who had been\r\nappointed by Dareios, Xerxes marched forth his army through Thrace to\r\ninvade Hellas.\r\n\r\n106. And Mascames, whom he left behind here, proved to be a man of such\r\nqualities that to him alone Xerxes used to send gifts, considering him\r\nthe best of all the men whom either he himself or Dareios had appointed\r\nto be governors,--he used to send him gifts, I say, every year, and so\r\nalso did Artaxerxes the son of Xerxes to the descendants of Mascames.\r\nFor even before this march governors had been appointed in Thrace and\r\neverywhere about the Hellespont; and these all, both those in Thrace and\r\nin the Hellespont, were conquered by the Hellenes after this expedition,\r\nexcept only the one who was at Doriscos; but Mascames at Doriscos none\r\nwere ever 98 able to conquer, though many tried. For this reason the\r\ngifts are sent continually for him from the king who reigns over the\r\nPersians.\r\n\r\n107. Of those however who were conquered by the Hellenes Xerxes did not\r\nconsider any to be a good man except only Boges, who was at Eïon: him\r\nhe never ceased commending, and he honoured very highly his children who\r\nsurvived him in the land of Persia. For in truth Boges proved himself\r\nworthy of great commendation, seeing that when he was besieged by the\r\nAthenians under Kimon the son of Miltiades, though he might have gone\r\nforth under a truce and so returned home to Asia, he preferred not to\r\ndo this, for fear that the king should that it was by cowardice that he\r\nsurvived; and he continued to hold out till the last. Then when there\r\nwas no longer any supply of provisions within the wall, he heaped\r\ntogether a great pyre, and he cut the throats of his children, his wife,\r\nhis concubines and his servants, and threw them into the fire; and after\r\nthis he scattered all the gold and silver in the city from the wall into\r\nthe river Strymon, and having so done he threw himself into the fire.\r\nThus he is justly commended even to this present time by the Persians.\r\n\r\n108. Xerxes from Doriscos was proceeding onwards to invade Hellas; and\r\nas he went he compelled those who successively came in his way, to join\r\nhis march: for the whole country as far as Thessaly had been reduced to\r\nsubjection, as has been set forth by me before, and was tributary under\r\nthe king, having been subdued by Megabazos and afterwards by Mardonios.\r\nAnd he passed in his march from Doriscos first by the Samothrakian\r\nstrongholds, of which that which is situated furthest towards the West\r\nis a city called Mesambria. Next to this follows Stryme, a city of the\r\nThasians, and midway between them flows the river Lisos, which at this\r\ntime did not suffice when supplying its water to the army of Xerxes, but\r\nthe stream failed. This country was in old time called Gallaïke, but now\r\nBriantike; however by strict justice this also belongs to the Kikonians.\r\n\r\n109. Having crossed over the bed of the river Lisos after it had been\r\ndried up, he passed by these Hellenic cities, namely Maroneia, Dicaia\r\nand Abdera. These I say he passed by, and also the following lakes of\r\nnote lying near them,--the Ismarian lake, lying between Maroneia and\r\nStryme; the Bistonian lake near Dicaia, into which two rivers pour their\r\nwaters, the Trauos 99 and the Compsantos; 100 and at Abdera no lake\r\nindeed of any note was passed by Xerxes, but the river Nestos, which\r\nflows there into the sea. Then after passing these places he went by the\r\ncities of the mainland, 101 near one of which there is, as it chances,\r\na lake of somewhere about thirty furlongs in circumference, abounding in\r\nfish and very brackish; this the baggage-animals alone dried up, being\r\nwatered at it: and the name of this city is Pistyros. 102\r\n\r\n110. These cities, I say, lying by the sea coast and belonging to\r\nHellenes, he passed by, leaving them on the left hand; and the tribes of\r\nThracians through whose country he marched were as follows, namely\r\nthe Paitians, Kikonians, Bistonians, Sapaians, Dersaians, Edonians,\r\nSatrians. Of these they who were settled along the sea coast accompanied\r\nhim with their ships, and those of them who dwelt inland and have been\r\nenumerated by me, were compelled to accompany him on land, except the\r\nSatrians:\r\n\r\n111, the Satrians however never yet became obedient to any man, so far\r\nas we know, but they remain up to my time still free, alone of all the\r\nThracians; for they dwell in lofty mountains, which are covered with\r\nforest of all kinds and with snow, and also they are very skilful in\r\nwar. These are they who possess the Oracle of Dionysos; which Oracle is\r\non their most lofty mountains. Of the Satrians those who act as prophets\r\n103 of the temple are the Bessians; it is a prophetess 104 who utters\r\nthe oracles, as at Delphi; and beyond this there is nothing further of a\r\nremarkable character. 105\r\n\r\n112. Xerxes having passed over the land which has been spoken of, next\r\nafter this passed the strongholds of the Pierians, of which the name\r\nof the one is Phagres and of the other Pergamos. By this way, I say,\r\nhe made his march, going close by the walls of these, and keeping Mount\r\nPangaion on the right hand, which is both great and lofty and in which\r\nare mines both of gold and of silver possessed by the Pierians and\r\nOdomantians, and especially by the Satrians.\r\n\r\n113. Thus passing by the Paionians, Doberians and Paioplians, who dwell\r\nbeyond Pangaion towards the North Wind, he went on Westwards, until at\r\nlast he came to the river Strymon and the city of Eïon, of which,\r\nso long as he lived, Boges was commander, the same about whom I was\r\nspeaking a short time back. This country about Mount Pangaion is called\r\nPhyllis, and it extends Westwards to the river Angites, which flows into\r\nthe Strymon, and Southwards it stretches to the Strymon itself; and at\r\nthis river the Magians sacrificed for good omens, slaying white horses.\r\n\r\n114. Having done this and many other things in addition to this, as\r\ncharms for the river, at the Nine Ways 106 in the land of the Edonians,\r\nthey proceeded by the bridges, for they had found the Strymon already\r\nyoked with bridges; and being informed that this place was called the\r\nNine Ways, they buried alive in it that number of boys and maidens,\r\nchildren of the natives of the place. Now burying alive is a Persian\r\ncustom; for I am informed that Amestris also, the wife of Xerxes, when\r\nshe had grown old, made return for her own life to the god who is said\r\nto be beneath the earth by burying twice seven children of Persians who\r\nwere men of renown.\r\n\r\n115. As the army proceeded on its march from the Strymon, it found after\r\nthis a sea-beach stretching towards the setting of the sun, and passed\r\nby the Hellenic city, Argilos, which was there placed. This region and\r\nthat which lies above it is called Bisaltia. Thence, keeping on the left\r\nhand the gulf which lies of Posideion, he went through the plain which\r\nis called the plain of Syleus, passing by Stageiros a Hellenic city, and\r\nso came to Acanthos, taking with him as he went each one of these tribes\r\nand also of those who dwell about Mount Pangaion, just as he did those\r\nwhom I enumerated before, having the men who dwelt along the sea coast\r\nto serve in the ships and those who dwelt inland to accompany him on\r\nfoot. This road by which Xerxes the king marched his army, the Thracians\r\ndo not disturb nor sow crops over, but pay very great reverence to it\r\ndown to my own time.\r\n\r\n116. Then when he had come to Acanthos, Xerxes proclaimed a\r\nguest-friendship with the people of Acanthos and also presented them\r\nwith the Median dress 107 and commended them, perceiving that they were\r\nzealous to serve him in the war and hearing of that which had been dug.\r\n\r\n117. And while Xerxes was in Acanthos, it happened that he who had\r\nbeen set over the making of the channel, Artachaies by name, died of\r\nsickness, a man who was highly esteemed by Xerxes and belonged to\r\nthe Achaimenid family; also he was in stature the tallest of all the\r\nPersians, falling short by only four fingers of being five royal cubits\r\n108 in height, and he had a voice the loudest of all men; so that Xerxes\r\nwas greatly grieved at the loss of him, and carried him forth and buried\r\nhim with great honour, and the whole army joined in throwing up a mound\r\nfor him. To this Artachaies the Acanthians by the bidding of an oracle\r\ndo sacrifice as a hero, calling upon his name in worship.\r\n\r\n118. King Xerxes, I say, was greatly grieved at the loss of Artachaies:\r\nand meanwhile the Hellenes who were entertaining his army and providing\r\nXerxes with dinners had been brought to utter ruin, so that they were\r\nbeing driven from house and home; seeing that when the Thasians, for\r\nexample, entertained the army of Xerxes and provided him with a dinner\r\non behalf of their towns upon the mainland, Antipater the son of Orgeus,\r\nwho had been appointed for this purpose, a man of repute among the\r\ncitizens equal to the best, reported that four hundred talents of silver\r\nhad been spent upon the dinner.\r\n\r\n119. Just so or nearly so in the other cities also those who were set\r\nover the business reported the reckoning to be: for the dinner was\r\ngiven as follows, having been ordered a long time beforehand, and being\r\ncounted by them a matter of great importance:--In the first place,\r\nso soon as they heard of it from the heralds who carried round the\r\nproclamation, the citizens in the various cities distributed corn among\r\ntheir several households, and all continued to make wheat and barley\r\nmeal for many months; then they fed cattle, finding out and obtaining\r\nthe finest animals for a high price; and they kept birds both of the\r\nland and of the water, in cages or in pools, all for the entertainment\r\nof the army. Then again they had drinking-cups and mixing-bowls made of\r\ngold and of silver, and all the other things which are placed upon the\r\ntable: these were made for the king himself and for those who ate at his\r\ntable; but for the rest of the army only the things appointed for food\r\nwere provided. Then whenever the army came to any place, there was a\r\ntent pitched ready wherein Xerxes himself made his stay, while the rest\r\nof the army remained out in the open air; and when it came to be time\r\nfor dinner, then the entertainers had labour; but the others, after they\r\nhad been satiated with food and had spent the night there, on the next\r\nday tore up the tent and taking with them all the movable furniture\r\nproceeded on their march, leaving nothing, but carrying all away with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n120. Then was uttered a word well spoken by Megacreon, a man of Abdera,\r\nwho advised those of Abdera to go in a body, both themselves and their\r\nwives, to their temples, and to sit down as suppliants of the gods,\r\nentreating them that for the future also they would ward off from them\r\nthe half of the evils which threatened; and he bade them feel great\r\nthankfulness to the gods for the past events, because king Xerxes had\r\nnot thought good to take food twice in each day; for if it had been\r\nordered to them beforehand to prepare breakfast also in like manner as\r\nthe dinner, it would have remained for the men of Abdera either not\r\nto await the coming of Xerxes, or if they stayed, to be crushed by\r\nmisfortune more than any other men upon the Earth.\r\n\r\n121. They then, I say, though hard put to it, yet were performing that\r\nwhich was appointed to them; and from Acanthos Xerxes, after having\r\ncommanded the generals to wait for the fleet at Therma, let the ships\r\ntake their course apart from himself, (now this Therma is that which is\r\nsituated on the Thermaic gulf, from which also this gulf has its name);\r\nand thus he did because he was informed that this was the shortest way:\r\nfor from Doriscos as far as Acanthos the army had been making its march\r\nthus:--Xerxes had divided the whole land-army into three divisions, and\r\none of them he had set to go along the sea accompanying the fleet, of\r\nwhich division Mardonios and Masistes were commanders; another third\r\nof the army had been appointed to go by the inland way, and of this the\r\ngenerals in command were Tritantaichmes and Gergis; and meanwhile the\r\nthird of the subdivisions, with which Xerxes himself went, marched in\r\nthe middle between them, and acknowledged as its commanders Smerdomenes\r\nand Megabyzos.\r\n\r\n122. The fleet, when it was let go by Xerxes and had sailed right\r\nthrough the channel made in Athos (which went across to the gulf on\r\nwhich are situated the cities of Assa, Piloros, Singos and Sarte),\r\nhaving taken up a contingent from these cities also, sailed thence\r\nwith a free course to the Thermaïc gulf, and turning round Ampelos the\r\nheadland of Torone, it left on one side the following Hellenic cities,\r\nfrom which it took up contingents of ships and men, namely Torone,\r\nGalepsos, Sermyle, Mekyberna, Olynthos: this region is called Sithonia.\r\n\r\n123. And the fleet of Xerxes, cutting across from the headland of\r\nAmpelos to that of Canastron, which runs out furthest to sea of all\r\nPallene, took up there contingents of ships and men from Potidaia,\r\nAphytis, Neapolis, Aige, Therambo, Skione, Mende and Sane, for these are\r\nthe cities which occupy the region which now is called Pallene, but was\r\nformerly called Phlegra. Then sailing along the coast of this country\r\nalso the fleet continued its course towards the place which has been\r\nmentioned before, taking up contingents also from the cities which come\r\nnext after Pallene and border upon the Thermaïc gulf; and the names\r\nof them are these,--Lipaxos, Combreia, Lisai, Gigonos, Campsa, Smila,\r\nAineia; and the region in which these cities are is called even to\r\nthe present day Crossaia. Then sailing from Aineia, with which name I\r\nbrought to an end the list of the cities, at once the fleet came into\r\nthe Thermaïc gulf and to the region of Mygdonia, and so it arrived at\r\nthe aforesaid Therma and at the cities of Sindos and Chalestra upon the\r\nriver Axios. This river is the boundary between the land of Mygdonia\r\nand Bottiaia, of which district the narrow region which lies on the sea\r\ncoast is occupied by the cities of Ichnai and Pella.\r\n\r\n124. Now while his naval force was encamped about the river Axios an the\r\ncity of Therma and the cities which lie between these two, waiting for\r\nthe coming of the king, Xerxes and the land-army were proceeding from\r\nAcanthos, cutting through the middle by the shortest way 109 with a view\r\nto reaching Therma: and he was proceeding through Paionia and Crestonia\r\nto the river Cheidoros, 110 which beginning from the land of the\r\nCrestonians, runs through the region of Mygdonia and comes out alongside\r\nof the marsh which is by the river Axios.\r\n\r\n125. As he was proceeding by this way, lions attacked the camels which\r\ncarried his provisions; for the lions used to come down regularly by\r\nnight, leaving their own haunts, but they touched nothing else, neither\r\nbeast of burden nor man, but killed the camels only: and I marvel what\r\nwas the cause, and what was it that impelled the lions to abstain from\r\nall else and to attack the camels only, creatures which they had never\r\nseen before, and of which they had had no experience.\r\n\r\n126. Now there are in these parts both many lions and also wild oxen,\r\nthose that have the very large horns which are often brought into\r\nHellas: and the limit within which these lions are found is on the one\r\nside the river Nestos, which flows through Abdera, and on the other the\r\nAchelos, which flows through Acarnania; for neither do the East of the\r\nNestos, in any part of Europe before you come to this, would you see a\r\nlion, nor again in the remaining part of the continent to the West of\r\nthe Acheloos, but they are produced in the middle space between these\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\n127. When Xerxes had reached Therma he established the army there; and\r\nhis army encamping there occupied of the land along by the sea no less\r\nthan this,--beginning from the city of Therma and from Mygdonia it\r\nextended as far as the river Lydias and the Haliacmon, which form the\r\nboundary between the lands of Bottiaia and Macedonia, mingling their\r\nwaters together in one and the same stream. The Barbarians, I say, were\r\nencamped in these regions; and of the rivers which have been enumerated,\r\nonly the river Cheidoros flowing from the Crestonian land was\r\ninsufficient for the drinking of the army and failed in its stream.\r\n\r\n128. Then Xerxes seeing from Therma the mountains of Thessaly, Olympos\r\nand Ossa, that they were of very great height, and being informed that\r\nin the midst between them there was a narrow channel, through which\r\nflows the Peneios, and hearing also that by this way there was a good\r\nroad leading to Thessaly, formed a desire to sail thither and look at\r\nthe outlet of the Peneios, because he was meaning to march by the upper\r\nroad, through the land of the Macedonians who dwell inland, until he\r\ncame to the Perraibians, passing by the city of Gonnos; for by this way\r\nhe was informed that it was safest to go. And having formed this desire,\r\nso also he proceeded to do; that is, he embarked in a Sidonian ship, the\r\nsame in which he used always to embark when he wished to do anything of\r\nthis kind, and he displayed a signal for the others to put out to sea\r\nalso, leaving there the land-army. Then when Xerxes had looked at the\r\noutlet of the Peneios, he was possessed by great wonder, and summoning\r\nhis guides he asked them whether it was possible to turn the river aside\r\nand bring it out to the sea by another way.\r\n\r\n129. Now it is said that Thessaly was in old time a lake, being enclosed\r\non all sides by very lofty mountains: for the parts of it which lie\r\ntowards the East are shut in by the ranges of Pelion and Ossa, which\r\njoin one another in their lower slopes, the parts towards the North\r\nWind by Olympos, those towards the West by Pindos and those towards\r\nthe mid-day and the South Wind by Othrys; and the region in the midst,\r\nbetween these mountains which have been named, is Thessaly, forming as\r\nit were a hollow. Whereas then many rivers flow into it and among them\r\nthese five of most note, namely Peneios, Apidanos, Onochonos, Enipeus\r\nand Pamisos, these, which collect their waters from the mountains that\r\nenclose Thessaly round, and flow into this plain, with names separate\r\neach one, having their outflow into the sea by one channel and that a\r\nnarrow one, first mingling their waters all together in one and the\r\nsame stream; and so soon as they are mingled together, from that point\r\nonwards the Peneios prevails with its name over the rest and causes\r\nthe others to lose their separate names. And it is said that in\r\nancient time, there not being yet this channel and outflow between the\r\nmountains, these rivers, and besides these rivers the lake Boibeïs also,\r\nhad no names as they have now, but by their waters they made Thessaly\r\nto be all sea. The Thessalians themselves say that Poseidon made the\r\nchannel through which the Peneios flows; and reasonably they report\r\nit thus, because whosoever believes that it is Poseidon who shakes the\r\nEarth and that the partings asunder produced by earthquake are the work\r\nof this god, would say, if he saw this, that it was made by Poseidon;\r\nfor the parting asunder of the mountains is the work of an earthquake,\r\nas is evident to me.\r\n\r\n130. So the guides, when Xerxes asked whether there was any other\r\npossible outlet to the sea for the Peneios, said with exact knowledge\r\nof the truth: \"O king, for this river there is no other outgoing which\r\nextends to the sea, but this alone; for all Thessaly is circled about\r\nwith mountains as with a crown.\" To this Xerxes is said to have replied:\r\n\"The Thessalians then are prudent men. This it appears was that which\r\nthey desired to guard against in good time 111 when they changed their\r\ncounsel, 112 reflecting on this especially besides other things, namely\r\nthat they had a country which, it appears, is easy to conquer and may\r\nquickly be taken: for it would have been necessary only to let the\r\nriver flow over their land by making an embankment to keep it from going\r\nthrough the narrow channel and so diverting the course by which now it\r\nflows, in order to put all Thessaly under water except the mountains.\"\r\nThis he said in reference to the sons of Aleuas, because they, being\r\nThessalians, were the first of the Hellenes who gave themselves over to\r\nthe king; for Xerxes thought that they offered him friendship on behalf\r\nof their whole nation. Having said thus and having looked at the place,\r\nhe sailed back to Therma.\r\n\r\n131. He then was staying in the region of Pieria many days, for the road\r\nover the mountains of Macedonia was being cut meanwhile by a third part\r\nof his army, that all the host might pass over by this way into the land\r\nof the Perraibians: and now the heralds returned who had been sent to\r\nHellas to demand the gift of earth, some empty-handed and others bearing\r\nearth and water.\r\n\r\n132. And among those who gave that which was demanded were the\r\nfollowing, namely the Thessalians, Dolopians, Enianians, 113\r\nPerraibians, Locrians, Megnesians, Malians, Achaians of Phthiotis, and\r\nThebans, with the rest of the Boeotians also excepting the Thespians and\r\nPlataians. Against these the Hellenes who took up war with the Barbarian\r\nmade an oath; and the oath was this,--that whosoever being Hellenes had\r\ngiven themselves over to the Persian, not being compelled, these, if\r\ntheir own affairs should come to a good conclusion, they would dedicate\r\nas an offering 114 to the god at Delphi.\r\n\r\n133. Thus ran the oath which was taken by the Hellenes: Xerxes however\r\nhad not sent to Athens or to Sparta heralds to demand the gift of earth,\r\nand for this reason, namely because at the former time when Dareios had\r\nsent for this very purpose, the one people threw the men who made the\r\ndemand into the pit 115 and the others into a well, and bade them take\r\nfrom thence earth and water and bear them to the king. For this reason\r\nXerxes did not send men to make this demand. And what evil thing 116\r\ncame upon the Athenians for having done this to the heralds, I am not\r\nable to say, except indeed that their land and city were laid waste; but\r\nI do not think that this happened for that cause:\r\n\r\n134, on the Lacedemonians however the wrath fell of Talthybios, the\r\nherald of Agamemnon; for in Sparta there is a temple of Talthybios, and\r\nthere are also descendants of Talthybios called Talthybiads, to whom\r\nhave been given as a right all the missions of heralds which go from\r\nSparta; and after this event it was not possible for the Spartans when\r\nthey sacrificed to obtain favourable omens. This was the case with them\r\nfor a long time; and as the Lacedemonians were grieved and regarded it\r\nas a great misfortune, and general assemblies were repeatedly gathered\r\ntogether and proclamation made, asking if any one of the Lacedemonians\r\nwas willing to die for Sparta, at length Sperthias the son of Aneristos\r\nand Bulis the son of Nicolaos, Spartans of noble birth and in wealth\r\nattaining to the first rank, voluntarily submitted to pay the penalty to\r\nXerxes for the heralds of Dareios which had perished at Sparta. Thus the\r\nSpartans sent these to the Medes to be put to death.\r\n\r\n135. And not only the courage then shown by these men is worthy of\r\nadmiration, but also the following sayings in addition: for as they were\r\non their way to Susa they came to Hydarnes (now Hydarnes was a Persian\r\nby race and commander of those who dwelt on the sea coasts of Asia), and\r\nhe offered them hospitality and entertained them; and while they were\r\nhis guests he asked them as follows: \"Lacedemonians, why is it that ye\r\nflee from becoming friends to the king? for ye may see that the king\r\nknows how to honour good men, when ye look at me and at my fortunes. So\r\nalso ye, Lacedemonians, if ye gave yourselves to the king, since ye have\r\nthe reputation with him already of being good men, would have rule each\r\none of you over Hellenic land by the gift of the king.\" To this they\r\nmade answer thus: \"Hydarnes, thy counsel with regard to us is not\r\nequally balanced, 117 for thou givest counsel having made trial indeed\r\nof the one thing, but being without experience of the other: thou\r\nknowest well what it is to be a slave, but thou hast never yet made\r\ntrial of freedom, whether it is pleasant to the taste or no; for if thou\r\nshouldest make trial of it, thou wouldest then counsel us to fight for\r\nit not with spears only but also with axes.\"\r\n\r\n136. Thus they answered Hydarnes; and then, after they had gone up to\r\nSusa and had come into the presence of the king, first when the spearmen\r\nof the guard commanded them and endeavoured to compel them by force to\r\ndo obeisance to the king by falling down before him, they said that they\r\nwould not do any such deed, though they should be pushed down by them\r\nhead foremost; for it was not their custom to do obeisance to a man,\r\nand it was not for this that they had come. Then when they had resisted\r\nthis, next they spoke these words or words to this effect: \"O king of\r\nthe Medes, the Lacedemonians sent us in place of the heralds who were\r\nslain in Sparta, to pay the penalty for their lives.\" When they said\r\nthis, Xerxes moved by a spirit of magnanimity replied that he would\r\nnot be like the Lacedemonians; for they had violated the rules which\r\nprevailed among all men by slaying heralds, but he would not do that\r\nhimself which he blamed them for having done, nor would he free the\r\nLacedemonians from their guilt by slaying these in return.\r\n\r\n137. Thus the wrath of Talthybios ceased for the time being, even though\r\nthe Spartans had done no more than this and although Sperthias and Bulis\r\nreturned back to Sparta; but a long time after this it was roused\r\nagain during the war between the Peloponnesians and Athenians, as the\r\nLacedemonians report. This I perceive to have been most evidently\r\nthe act of the Deity: for in that the wrath of Talthybios fell upon\r\nmessengers and did not cease until it had been fully satisfied, so much\r\nwas but in accordance with justice; but that it happened to come upon\r\nthe sons of these men who went up to the king on account of the wrath,\r\nnamely upon Nicolaos the son of Bulis and Aneristos the son of Sperthias\r\n(the same who conquered the men of Halieis, who came from Tiryns, by\r\nsailing into their harbour with a merchant ship filled with fighting\r\nmen),--by this it is evident to me that the matter came to pass by\r\nthe act of the Deity caused by this wrath. For these men, sent by the\r\nLacedemonians as envoys to Asia, having been betrayed by Sitalkes the\r\nson of Teres king of the Thracians and by Nymphodoros the son of Pythes\r\na man of Abdera, were captured at Bisanthe on the Hellespont; and\r\nthen having been carried away to Attica they were put to death by\r\nthe Athenians, and with them also Aristeas the son of Adeimantos the\r\nCorinthian. These things happened many years after the expedition of the\r\nking; and I return now to the former narrative.\r\n\r\n138. Now the march of the king's army was in name against Athens, but in\r\nfact it was going against all Hellas: and the Hellenes being informed of\r\nthis long before were not all equally affected by it; for some of them\r\nhaving given earth and water to the Persian had confidence, supposing\r\nthat they would suffer no hurt from the Barbarian; while others not\r\nhaving given were in great terror, seeing that there were not ships\r\nexisting in Hellas which were capable as regards number of receiving the\r\ninvader in fight, and seeing that the greater part of the States were\r\nnot willing to take up the war, but adopted readily the side of the\r\nMedes.\r\n\r\n139. And here I am compelled by necessity to declare an opinion which in\r\nthe eyes of most men would seem to be invidious, but nevertheless I will\r\nnot abstain from saying that which I see evidently to be the truth. If\r\nthe Athenians had been seized with fear of the danger which threatened\r\nthem and had left their land, 118 or again, without leaving their land,\r\nhad stayed and given themselves up to Xerxes, none would have made any\r\nattempt by sea to oppose the king. If then none had opposed Xerxes by\r\nsea, it would have happened on the land somewhat thus:--even if\r\nmany tunics of walls 119 had been thrown across the Isthmus by the\r\nPeloponnesians, the Lacedemonians would have been deserted by their\r\nallies, not voluntarily but of necessity, since these would have been\r\nconquered city after city by the naval force of the Barbarian, and so\r\nthey would have been left alone: and having been left alone and having\r\ndisplayed great deeds of valour, they would have met their death nobly.\r\nEither they would have suffered this fate, or before this, seeing the\r\nother Hellenes also taking the side of the Medes, they would have made\r\nan agreement with Xerxes; and thus in either case Hellas would have come\r\nto be under the rule of the Persians: for as to the good to be got from\r\nthe walls thrown across the Isthmus, I am unable to discover what it\r\nwould have been, when the king had command of the sea. As it is however,\r\nif a man should say that the Athenians proved to be the saviours of\r\nHellas, he would not fail to hit the truth; for to whichever side these\r\nturned, to that the balance was likely to incline: and these were they\r\nwho, preferring that Hellas should continue to exist in freedom, roused\r\nup all of Hellas which remained, so much, that is, as had not gone over\r\nto the Medes, and (after the gods at least) these were they who repelled\r\nthe king. Nor did fearful oracles, which came from Delphi and cast them\r\ninto dread, induce them to leave Hellas, but they stayed behind and\r\nendured to receive the invader of their land.\r\n\r\n140. For the Athenians had sent men to Delphi to inquire and were\r\npreparing to consult the Oracle; and after these had performed the usual\r\nrites in the sacred precincts, when they had entered the sanctuary 120\r\nand were sitting down there, the Pythian prophetess, whose name was\r\nAristonike, uttered to them this oracle:\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Why do ye sit, O ye wretched? Flee thou 121 to the uttermost\r\n   limits, Leaving thy home and the heights of the wheel-round city\r\n   behind thee! Lo, there remaineth now nor the head nor the body in\r\n   safety,--Neither the feet below nor the hands nor the middle are\r\n   left thee,--All are destroyed 122 together; for fire and the\r\n   passionate War-god, 123 Urging the Syrian 124 car to speed, doth\r\n   hurl them 125 to ruin. Not thine alone, he shall cause many more\r\n   great strongholds to perish, Yes, many temples of gods to the\r\n   ravening fire shall deliver,--Temples which stand now surely with\r\n   sweat of their terror down-streaming, Quaking with dread; and lo!\r\n   from the topmost roof to the pavement Dark blood trickles,\r\n   forecasting the dire unavoidable evil. Forth with you, forth from\r\n   the shrine, and steep your soul in the sorrow!\" 126\r\n\r\n141. Hearing this the men who had been sent by the Athenians to consult\r\nthe Oracle were very greatly distressed; and as they were despairing by\r\nreason of the evil which had been prophesied to them, Timon the son of\r\nAndrobulos, a man of the Delphians in reputation equal to the first,\r\ncounselled them to take a suppliant's bough and to approach the second\r\ntime and consult the Oracle as suppliants. The Athenians did as he\r\nadvised and said: \"Lord, 127 we pray thee utter to us some better oracle\r\nabout our native land, having respect to these suppliant boughs which we\r\nhave come to thee bearing; otherwise surely we will not depart away from\r\nthe sanctuary, but will remain here where we are now, even until we\r\nbring our lives to an end.\" When they spoke these words, the prophetess\r\ngave them a second oracle as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Pallas cannot prevail to appease great Zeus in Olympos, Though she\r\n   with words very many and wiles close-woven entreat him. But I will\r\n   tell thee this more, and will clench it with steel adamantine: Then\r\n   when all else shall be taken, whatever the boundary 128 of Kecrops\r\n   Holdeth within, and the dark ravines of divinest Kithairon, A\r\n   bulwark of wood at the last Zeus grants to the Trito-born goddess\r\n   Sole to remain unwasted, which thee and thy children shall profit.\r\n   Stay thou not there for the horsemen to come and the footmen\r\n   unnumbered; Stay thou not still for the host from the mainland to\r\n   come, but retire thee, Turning thy back to the foe, for yet thou\r\n   shalt face him hereafter. Salamis, thou the divine, thou shalt cause\r\n   sons of women to perish, Or when the grain 129 is scattered or\r\n   when it is gathered together.\"\r\n\r\n142. This seemed to them to be (as in truth it was) a milder utterance\r\nthan the former one; therefore they had it written down and departed\r\nwith it to Athens: and when the messengers after their return made\r\nreport to the people, many various opinions were expressed by persons\r\ninquiring into the meaning of the oracle, and among them these, standing\r\nmost in opposition to one another:--some of the elder men said they\r\nthought that the god had prophesied to them that the Acropolis should\r\nsurvive; for the Acropolis of the Athenians was in old time fenced with\r\na thorn hedge; and they conjectured accordingly that this saying about\r\nthe \"bulwark of wood\" referred to the fence: others on the contrary said\r\nthat the god meant by this their ships, and they advised to leave all\r\nelse and get ready these. Now they who said that the ships were the\r\nbulwark of wood were shaken in their interpretation by the two last\r\nverses which the prophetess uttered:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Salamis, thou the divine, thou shalt cause sons of women to perish,\r\n  Or when the grain is scattered or when it is gathered together.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to these verses the opinions of those who said that the\r\nships were the bulwark of wood were disturbed; for the interpreters of\r\noracles took these to mean that it was fated for them, having got ready\r\nfor a sea-fight, to suffer defeat round about Salamis.\r\n\r\n143. Now there was one man of the Athenians who had lately been coming\r\nforward to take a place among the first, whose name was Themistocles,\r\ncalled son of Neocles. This man said that the interpreters of oracles\r\ndid not make right conjecture of the whole, and he spoke as follows,\r\nsaying that if these words that had been uttered referred really to the\r\nAthenians, he did not think it would have been so mildly expressed in\r\nthe oracle, but rather thus, \"Salamis, thou the merciless,\" instead of\r\n\"Salamis, thou the divine,\" at least if its settlers were destined to\r\nperish round about it: but in truth the oracle had been spoken by the\r\ngod with reference to the enemy, if one understood it rightly, and not\r\nto the Athenians: therefore he counselled them to get ready to fight a\r\nbattle by sea, for in this was their bulwark of wood. When Themistocles\r\ndeclared his opinion thus, the Athenians judged that this was to be\r\npreferred by them rather than the advice of the interpreters of oracles,\r\nwho bade them not make ready for a sea-fight, nor in short raise their\r\nhands at all in opposition, but leave the land of Attica and settle in\r\nsome other.\r\n\r\n144. Another opinion too of Themistocles before this one proved the best\r\nat the right moment, when the Athenians, having got large sums of money\r\nin the public treasury, which had come in to them from the mines which\r\nare at Laureion, were intending to share it among themselves, taking\r\neach in turn the sum of ten drachmas. Then Themistocles persuaded the\r\nAthenians to give up this plan of division and to make for themselves\r\nwith this money two hundred ships for the war, meaning by that the war\r\nwith the Eginetans: for this war having arisen 130 proved in fact the\r\nsalvation of Hellas at that time, by compelling the Athenians to become\r\na naval power. And the ships, not having been used for the purpose for\r\nwhich they had been made, thus proved of service at need to Hellas.\r\nThese ships then, I say, the Athenians had already, having built them\r\nbeforehand, and it was necessary in addition to these to construct\r\nothers. They resolved then, when they took counsel after the oracle was\r\ngiven, to receive the Barbarian invading Hellas with their ships in full\r\nforce, following the commands of the god, in combination with those of\r\nthe Hellenes who were willing to join them.\r\n\r\n145. These oracles had been given before to the Athenians: and when\r\nthose Hellenes who had the better mind about Hellas 131 came together to\r\none place, and considered their affairs and interchanged assurances with\r\none another, then deliberating together they thought it well first of\r\nall things to reconcile the enmities and bring to an end the wars which\r\nthey had with one another. Now there were wars engaged 132 between\r\nothers also, and especially between the Athenians and the Eginetans.\r\nAfter this, being informed that Xerxes was with his army at Sardis, they\r\ndetermined to send spies to Asia to make observation of the power of\r\nthe king; and moreover they resolved to send envoys to Argos to form an\r\nalliance against the Persian, and to send others to Sicily to Gelon\r\nthe son of Deinomenes and also to Corcyra, to urge them to come to the\r\nassistance of Hellas, and others again to Crete; for they made it their\r\naim that if possible the Hellenic race might unite in one, and that they\r\nmight join all together and act towards the same end, since dangers were\r\nthreatening all the Hellenes equally. Now the power of Gelon was said to\r\nbe great, far greater than any other Hellenic power.\r\n\r\n146. When they had thus resolved, they reconciled their enmities and\r\nthen sent first three men as spies to Asia. These having come to Sardis\r\nand having got knowledge about the king's army, were discovered, and\r\nafter having been examined by the generals of the land-army were being\r\nled off to die. For these men, I say, death had been determined; but\r\nXerxes, being informed of this, found fault with the decision of the\r\ngenerals and sent some of the spearmen of his guard, enjoining them, if\r\nthey should find the spies yet alive, to bring them to his presence. So\r\nhaving found them yet surviving they brought them into the presence of\r\nthe king; and upon that Xerxes, being informed for what purpose they\r\nhad come, commanded the spearmen to lead them round and to show them the\r\nwhole army both foot and horse, and when they should have had their fill\r\nof looking at these things, to let them go unhurt to whatsoever land\r\nthey desired.\r\n\r\n147. Such was the command which he gave, adding at the same time this\r\nsaying, namely that if the spies had been put to death, the Hellenes\r\nwould not have been informed beforehand of his power, how far beyond\r\ndescription it was; while on the other hand by putting to death three\r\nmen they would not very greatly have damaged the enemy; but when these\r\nreturned back to Hellas, he thought it likely that the Hellenes, hearing\r\nof his power, would deliver up their freedom to him themselves, before\r\nthe expedition took place which was being set in motion; and thus there\r\nwould be no need for them to have the labour of marching an army against\r\nthem. This opinion of his is like his manner of thinking at other times;\r\n133 for when Xerxes was in Abydos, he saw vessels which carried corn\r\nfrom the Pontus sailing out through the Hellespont on their way to Egina\r\nand the Peloponnese. Those then who sat by his side, being informed that\r\nthe ships belonged to the enemy, were prepared to capture them, and were\r\nlooking to the king to see when he would give the word; but Xerxes asked\r\nabout them whither the men were sailing, and they replied: \"Master, to\r\nthy foes, conveying to them corn\": he then made answer and said: \"Are we\r\nnot also sailing to the same place as these men, furnished with corn as\r\nwell as with other things necessary? How then do these wrong us, since\r\nthey are conveying provisions for our use?\"\r\n\r\n148. The spies then, having thus looked at everything and after that\r\nhaving been dismissed, returned back to Europe: and meanwhile those\r\nof the Hellenes who had sworn alliance against the Persian, after the\r\nsending forth of the spies proceeded to send envoys next to Argos. Now\r\nthe Argives report that the matters concerning themselves took place\r\nas follows:--They were informed, they say, at the very first of the\r\nmovement which was being set on foot by the Barbarian against Hellas;\r\nand having been informed of this and perceiving that the Hellenes would\r\nendeavour to get their alliance against the Persians, they had sent\r\nmessengers to inquire of the god at Delphi, and to ask how they should\r\nact in order that it might be best for themselves: because lately there\r\nhad been slain of them six thousand men by the Lacedemonians and by\r\nCleomenes the son of Anaxandrides, 134 and this in fact was the reason\r\nthat they were sending to inquire: and when they inquired, the Pythian\r\nprophetess made answer to them as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Thou to thy neighbours a foe, by the gods immortal beloved,\r\n  Keep thou thy spear 135 within bounds, and sit well-guarded behind it:\r\n  Guard well the head, and the head shall preserve the limbs and the body.\"\r\n\r\nThus, they say, the Pythian prophetess had replied to them before this;\r\nand afterwards when the messengers of the Hellenes came, as I said, to\r\nArgos, they entered the Council-chamber and spoke that which had been\r\nenjoined to them; and to that which was said the Council replied that\r\nthe Argives were ready to do as they were requested, on condition that\r\nthey got peace made with the Lacedemonians for thirty years and that\r\nthey had half the leadership of the whole confederacy: and yet by\r\nstrict right (they said) the whole leadership fell to their share, but\r\nnevertheless it was sufficient for them to have half.\r\n\r\n149. Thus they report that the Council made answer, although the oracle\r\nforbade them to make the alliance with the Hellenes; and they were\r\nanxious, they say, that a truce from hostilities for thirty years should\r\nbe made, although they feared the oracle, in order, as they allege, that\r\ntheir sons might grow to manhood in these years; whereas if a truce did\r\nnot exist, they had fear that, supposing another disaster should come\r\nupon them in fighting against the Persian in addition to that which had\r\nbefallen them already, they might be for all future time subject to\r\nthe Lacedemonians. To that which was spoken by the Council those of the\r\nenvoys who were of Sparta replied, that as to the truce they would refer\r\nthe matter to their public assembly, 136 but as to the leadership they\r\nhad themselves been commissioned to make reply, and did in fact say\r\nthis, namely that they had two kings, while the Argives had one; and it\r\nwas not possible to remove either of the two who were of Sparta from the\r\nleadership, but there was nothing to prevent the Argive king from having\r\nan equal vote with each of their two. Then, say the Argives, they could\r\nnot endure the grasping selfishness of the Spartans, but chose to\r\nbe ruled by the Barbarians rather than to yield at all to the\r\nLacedemonians; and they gave notice to the envoys to depart out of the\r\nterritory of the Argives before sunset, or, if not, they would be dealt\r\nwith as enemies.\r\n\r\n150. The Argives themselves report so much about these matters: but\r\nthere is another story reported in Hellas to the effect that Xerxes\r\nsent a herald to Argos before he set forth to make an expedition against\r\nHellas, and this herald, they say, when he had come, spoke as follows:\r\n\"Men of Argos, king Xerxes says to you these things:--We hold that\r\nPerses, from whom we are descended, was the son of Perseus, the son of\r\nDanae, and was born of the daughter of Kepheus, Andromeda; and according\r\nto this it would seem that we are descended from you. It is not fitting\r\nthen that we should go forth on an expedition against those from whom we\r\ntrace our descent, nor that ye should set yourselves in opposition to us\r\nby rendering assistance to others; but it is fitting that ye keep still\r\nand remain by yourselves: for if things happen according to my mind,\r\nI shall not esteem any people to be of greater consequence than you.\"\r\nHaving heard this the Argives, it is said, considered it a great matter;\r\nand therefore at first they made no offer of help nor did they ask for\r\nany share; but afterwards, when the Hellenes tried to get them on their\r\nside, then, since they knew well that the Lacedemonians would not give\r\nthem a share in the command, they asked for this merely in order that\r\nthey might have a pretext for remaining still.\r\n\r\n151. Also some of the Hellenes report that the following event, in\r\nagreement with this account, came to pass many years after these\r\nthings:--there happened, they say, to be in Susa the city of Memnon 137\r\nenvoys of the Athenians come about some other matter, namely Callias the\r\nson of Hipponicos and the others who went up with him; and the Argives\r\nat that very time had also sent envoys to Susa, and these asked\r\nArtoxerxes the son of Xerxes, whether the friendship which they had\r\nformed with Xerxes still remained unbroken, if they themselves desired\r\nto maintain it, 138 or whether they were esteemed by him to be enemies;\r\nand king Artoxerxes said that it most certainly remained unbroken, and\r\nthat there was no city which he considered to be more his friend than\r\nArgos.\r\n\r\n152. Now whether Xerxes did indeed send a herald to Argos saying that\r\nwhich has been reported, and whether envoys of the Argives who had gone\r\nup to Susa inquired of Artoxerxes concerning friendship, I am not able\r\nto say for certain; nor do I declare any opinion about the matters in\r\nquestion other than that which the Argives themselves report: but I know\r\nthis much, that if all the nations of men should bring together into one\r\nplace the evils which they have suffered themselves, desiring to make\r\nexchange with their neighbours, each people of them, when they had\r\nexamined closely the evils suffered by their fellows, would gladly carry\r\naway back with them those which they had brought. 139 Thus it is not the\r\nArgives who have acted most basely of all. I however am bound to report\r\nthat which is reported, though I am not bound altogether to believe\r\nit; and let this saying be considered to hold good as regards every\r\nnarrative in the history: for I must add that this also is reported,\r\nnamely that the Argives were actually those who invited the Persian to\r\ninvade Hellas, because their war with the Lacedemonians had had an evil\r\nissue, being willing to suffer anything whatever rather than the trouble\r\nwhich was then upon them.\r\n\r\n153. That which concerns the Argives has now been said: and meanwhile\r\nenvoys had come to Sicily from the allies, to confer with Gelon, among\r\nwhom was also Syagros from the Lacedemonians. Now the ancestor of this\r\nGelon, he who was at Gela as a settler, 140 was a native of the island\r\nof Telos, which lies off Triopion; and when Gela was founded by the\r\nLindians of Rhodes and by Antiphemos, he was not left behind. Then in\r\ncourse of time his descendants became and continued to be priests of the\r\nmysteries of the Earth goddesses, 141 an office which was acquired by\r\nTelines one of their ancestors in the following manner:--certain of the\r\nmen of Gela, being worsted in a party struggle, had fled to Mactorion,\r\nthe city which stands above Gela: these men Telines brought back to Gela\r\nfrom exile with no force of men but only with the sacred rites of these\r\ngoddesses; but from whom he received them, or whether he obtained them\r\nfor himself, 142 this I am not able to say; trusting in these\r\nhowever, he brought the men back from exile, on the condition that his\r\ndescendants should be priests of the mysteries of the goddesses. To me\r\nit has caused wonder also that Telines should have been able to perform\r\nso great a deed, considering that which I am told; for such deeds, I\r\nthink, are not apt to proceed from every man, but from one who has a\r\nbrave spirit and manly vigour, whereas Telines is said by the dwellers\r\nin Sicily to have been on the contrary a man of effeminate character and\r\nrather poor spirit.\r\n\r\n154. He then had thus obtained the privilege of which I speak: and when\r\nCleander the son of Pantares brought his life to an end, having been\r\ndespot of Gela for seven years and being killed at last by Sabyllos a\r\nman of Gela, then Hippocrates succeeded to the monarchy, who was\r\nbrother of Cleander. And while Hippocrates was despot, Gelon, who was a\r\ndescendant of Telines the priest of the mysteries, was spearman of the\r\nguard 143 to Hippocrates with many others and among them Ainesidemos the\r\nson of Pataicos. Then after no long time he was appointed by reason\r\nof valour to be commander of the whole cavalry; for when Hippocrates\r\nbesieged successively the cities of Callipolis, Naxos, Zancle, Leontini,\r\nand also Syracuse and many towns of the Barbarians, in these wars Gelon\r\nshowed himself a most brilliant warrior; and of the cities which I\r\njust now mentioned, not one except Syracuse escaped being reduced to\r\nsubjection by Hippocrates: the Syracusans however, after they had been\r\ndefeated in battle at the river Eloros, were rescued by the Corinthians\r\nand Corcyreans; these rescued them and brought the quarrel to a\r\nsettlement on this condition, namely that the Syracusans should deliver\r\nup Camarina to Hippocrates. Now Camarina used in ancient time to belong\r\nto the men of Syracuse.\r\n\r\n155. Then when it was the fate of Hippocrates also, after having been\r\ndespot for the same number of years as his brother Cleander, to be\r\nkilled at the city of Hybla, whither he had gone on an expedition\r\nagainst the Sikelians, then Gelon made a pretence of helping the sons\r\nof Hippocrates, Eucleides and Cleander, when the citizens were no longer\r\nwilling to submit; but actually, when he had been victorious in a battle\r\nover the men of Gela, he robbed the sons of Hippocrates of the power and\r\nwas ruler himself. After this stroke of fortune Gelon restored those of\r\nthe Syracusans who were called \"land-holders,\" 144 after they had been\r\ndriven into exile by the common people and by their own slaves, who\r\nwere called Kyllyrians, 145 these, I say, he restored from the city of\r\nCasmene to Syracuse, and so got possession of this last city also, for\r\nthe common people of Syracuse, when Gelon came against them, delivered\r\nup to him their city and themselves.\r\n\r\n156. So after he had received Syracuse into his power, he made less\r\naccount of Gela, of which he was ruler also in addition, and he gave\r\nit in charge to Hieron his brother, while he proceeded to strengthen\r\nSyracuse. So forthwith that city rose and shot up to prosperity; for in\r\nthe first place he brought all those of Camarina to Syracuse and made\r\nthem citizens, and razed to the ground the city of Camarina; then\r\nsecondly he did the same to more than half of the men of Gela, as he had\r\ndone to those of Camarina: and as regards the Megarians of Sicily, when\r\nthey were besieged and had surrendered by capitulation, the well-to-do\r\nmen 146 of them, though they had stirred up war with him and expected\r\nto be put to death for this reason, he brought to Syracuse and made them\r\ncitizens, but the common people of the Megarians, who had no share in\r\nthe guilt of this war and did not expect that they would suffer any\r\nevil, these also he brought to Syracuse and sold them as slaves to be\r\ncarried away from Sicily: and the same thing he did moreover to the men\r\nof Euboia in Sicily, making a distinction between them: and he dealt\r\nthus with these two cities because he thought that a body of commons was\r\na most unpleasant element in the State.\r\n\r\n157. In the manner then which has been described Gelon had become a\r\npowerful despot; and at this time when the envoys of the Hellenes had\r\narrived at Syracuse, they came to speech with him and said as follows:\r\n\"The Lacedemonians and their allies sent us to get thee to be on our\r\nside against the Barbarian; for we suppose that thou art certainly\r\ninformed of him who is about to invade Hellas, namely that a Persian\r\nis designing to bridge over the Hellespont, and to make an expedition\r\nagainst Hellas, leading against us out of Asia all the armies of the\r\nEast, under colour of marching upon Athens, but in fact meaning to bring\r\nall Hellas to subjection under him. Do thou therefore, seeing that 147\r\nthou hast attained to a great power and hast no small portion of Hellas\r\nfor thy share, being the ruler of Sicily, come to the assistance of\r\nthose who are endeavouring to free Hellas, and join in making her free;\r\nfor if all Hellas be gathered together in one, it forms a great body,\r\nand we are made a match in fight for those who are coming against us;\r\nbut if some of us go over to the enemy and others are not willing to\r\nhelp, and the sound portion of Hellas is consequently small, there is at\r\nonce in this a danger that all Hellas may fall to ruin. For do not thou\r\nhope that if the Persian shall overcome us in battle he will not come\r\nto thee, but guard thyself against this beforehand; for in coming to\r\nour assistance thou art helping thyself; and the matter which is wisely\r\nplanned has for the most part a good issue afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n158. The envoys spoke thus; and Gelon was very vehement with them,\r\nspeaking to them as follows: \"Hellenes, a selfish speech is this, with\r\nwhich ye have ventured to come and invite me to be your ally against the\r\nBarbarian; whereas ye yourselves, when I in former time requested of you\r\nto join with me in fighting against an army of Barbarians, contention\r\nhaving arisen between me and the Carthaginians, and when I charged you\r\nto exact vengeance of the men of Egesta for the death of Dorieos the son\r\nof Anaxandrides, 148 while at the same time I offered to help in setting\r\nfree the trading-places, from which great advantages and gains have\r\nbeen reaped by you,--ye, I say, then neither for my own sake came to my\r\nassistance, nor in order to exact vengeance for the death of Dorieos;\r\nand, so far as ye are concerned, all these parts are even now under the\r\nrule of Barbarians. But since it turned out well for us and came to a\r\nbetter issue, now that the war has come round and reached you, there has\r\nat last arisen in your minds a recollection of Gelon. However, though I\r\nhave met with contempt at your hands, I will not act like you; but I am\r\nprepared to come to your assistance, supplying two hundred triremes\r\nand twenty thousand hoplites, with two thousand horsemen, two thousand\r\nbowmen, two thousand slingers and two thousand light-armed men to run\r\nbeside the horsemen; and moreover I will undertake to supply corn for\r\nthe whole army of the Hellenes, until we have finished the war. These\r\nthings I engage to supply on this condition, namely that I shall be\r\ncommander and leader of the Hellenes against the Barbarian; but on any\r\nother condition I will neither come myself nor will I send others.\"\r\n\r\n159. Hearing this Syagros could not contain himself but spoke these\r\nwords: \"Deeply, I trow, would Agamemnon son of Pelops lament, 149 if he\r\nheard that the Spartans had had the leadership taken away from them by\r\nGelon and by the Syracusans. Nay, but make thou no further mention of\r\nthis condition, namely that we should deliver the leadership to thee;\r\nbut if thou art desirous to come to the assistance of Hellas, know that\r\nthou wilt be under the command of the Lacedemonians; and if thou dost\r\nindeed claim not to be under command, come not thou to our help at all.\"\r\n\r\n160. To this Gelon, seeing that the speech of Syagros was adverse, set\r\nforth to them his last proposal thus: \"Stranger from Sparta, reproaches\r\nsinking into the heart of a man are wont to rouse his spirit in anger\r\nagainst them; thou however, though thou hast uttered insults against me\r\nin thy speech, wilt not bring me to show myself unseemly in my reply.\r\nBut whereas ye so strongly lay claim to the leadership, it were fitting\r\nthat I should lay claim to it more than ye, seeing that I am the leader\r\nof an army many times as large and of ships many more. Since however\r\nthis condition is so distasteful to you, 150 we will recede somewhat\r\nfrom our former proposal. Suppose that ye should be leaders of\r\nthe land-army and I of the fleet; or if it pleases you to lead the\r\nsea-forces, I am willing to be leader of those on land; and either ye\r\nmust be contented with these terms or go away without the alliance which\r\nI have to give.\"\r\n\r\n161. Gelon, I say, made these offers, and the envoy of the Athenians,\r\nanswering before that of the Lacedemonians, replied to him as follows:\r\n\"O king of the Syracusans, it was not of a leader that Hellas was in\r\nwant when it sent us to thee, but of an army. Thou however dost not set\r\nbefore us the hope that thou wilt send an army, except thou have the\r\nleadership of Hellas; and thou art striving how thou mayest become\r\ncommander of the armies of Hellas. So long then as it was thy demand to\r\nbe leader of the whole army of the Hellenes, it was sufficient for us\r\nAthenians to keep silence, knowing that the Lacedemonian would be able\r\nto make defence even for us both; but now, since being repulsed from the\r\ndemand for the whole thou art requesting to be commander of the naval\r\nforce, we tell that thus it is:--not even if the Lacedemonian shall\r\npermit thee to be commander of it, will we permit thee; for this at\r\nleast is our own, if the Lacedemonians do not themselves desire to have\r\nit. With these, if they desire to be the leaders, we do not contend;\r\nbut none others beside ourselves shall we permit to be in command of\r\nthe ships: for then to no purpose should we be possessors of a\r\nsea-force larger than any other which belongs to the Hellenes, if, being\r\nAthenians, we should yield the leadership to Syracusans, we who boast of\r\na race which is the most ancient of all and who are of all the Hellenes\r\nthe only people who have not changed from one land to another; to whom\r\nalso belonged a man whom Homer the Epic poet said was the best of all\r\nwho came to Ilion in drawing up an army and setting it in array. 151\r\nThus we are not justly to be reproached if we say these things.\"\r\n\r\n162. To this Gelon made answer thus: \"Stranger of Athens, it would seem\r\nthat ye have the commanders, but that ye will not have the men to be\r\ncommanded. Since then ye will not at all give way, but desire to\r\nhave the whole, it were well that ye should depart home as quickly as\r\npossible and report to the Hellenes that the spring has been taken out\r\nof their year.\" Now this is the meaning of the saying:--evidently the\r\nspring is the noblest part of the year; and so he meant to say that\r\nhis army was the noblest part of the army of the Hellenes: for Hellas\r\ntherefore, deprived of his alliance, it was, he said, as if the spring\r\nhad been taken out of the year. 152\r\n\r\n163. The envoys of the Hellenes, having thus had conference with Gelon,\r\nsailed away; and Gelon upon this, fearing on the one hand about the\r\nHellenes, lest they should not be able to overcome the Barbarian, and\r\non the other hand considering it monstrous and not to be endured that\r\nhe should come to Peloponnesus and be under the command of the\r\nLacedemonians, seeing that he was despot of Sicily, gave up the thought\r\nof this way and followed another: for so soon as he was informed that\r\nthe Persian had crossed over the Hellespont, he sent Cadmos the son of\r\nSkythes, a man of Cos, with three fifty-oared galleys to Delphi, bearing\r\nlarge sums of money and friendly proposals, to wait there and see how\r\nthe battle would fall out: and if the Barbarian should be victorious,\r\nhe was to give him the money and also to offer him earth and water\r\nfrom those over whom Gelon had rule; but if the Hellenes should be\r\nvictorious, he was bidden to bring it back.\r\n\r\n164. Now this Cadmos before these events, having received from his\r\nfather in a prosperous state the government 153 of the people of Cos,\r\nhad voluntarily and with no danger threatening, but moved merely by\r\nuprightness of nature, placed the government in the hands of the people\r\nof Cos 154 and had departed to Sicily, where he took from 155 the\r\nSamians and newly colonised the city of Zancle, which had changed its\r\nname to Messene. This same Cadmos, having come thither in such manner\r\nas I have said, Gelon was now sending, having selected him on account of\r\nthe integrity which in other matters he had himself found to be in him;\r\nand this man, in addition to the other upright acts which had been done\r\nby him, left also this to be remembered, which was not the least of\r\nthem: for having got into his hands that great sum of money which Gelon\r\nentrusted to his charge, though he might have taken possession of it\r\nhimself he did not choose to do so; but when the Hellenes had got the\r\nbetter in the sea-fight and Xerxes had marched away and departed, he\r\nalso returned to Sicily bringing back with him the whole sum of money.\r\n\r\n165. The story which here follows is also reported by those who dwell in\r\nSicily, namely that, even though he was to be under the command of the\r\nLacedemonians, Gelon would have come to the assistance of the Hellenes,\r\nbut that Terillos, the son of Crinippos and despot of Himera, having\r\nbeen driven out of Himera by Theron the son of Ainesidemos 156 the ruler\r\nof the Agrigentines, was just at this very time bringing in an army\r\nof Phenicians, Libyans, Iberians, Ligurians, Elisycans, Sardinians and\r\nCorsicans, to the number of thirty myriads, 157 with Amilcas the son of\r\nAnnon king of the Carthaginians as their commander, whom Terillos had\r\npersuaded partly by reason of his own guest-friendship, and especially\r\nby the zealous assistance of Anaxilaos the son of Cretines, who was\r\ndespot of Rhegion, and who to help his father-in-law endeavoured to\r\nbring in Amilcas to Sicily, and had given him his sons as hostages;\r\nfor Anaxilaos was married to the daughter of Terillos, whose name was\r\nKydippe. Thus it was, they say, that Gelon was not able to come to the\r\nassistance of the Hellenes, and sent therefore the money to Delphi.\r\n\r\n166. In addition to this they report also that, as it happened, Gelon\r\nand Theron were victorious over Amilcas the Carthaginian on the very\r\nsame day when the Hellenes were victorious at Salamis over the Persian.\r\nAnd this Amilcas, who was a Carthaginian on the father's side but on\r\nthe mother's Syracusan, and who had become king of the Carthaginians by\r\nmerit, when the engagement took place and he was being worsted in the\r\nbattle, disappeared, as I am informed; for neither alive nor dead did he\r\nappear again anywhere upon the earth, though Gelon used all diligence in\r\nthe search for him.\r\n\r\n167. Moreover there is also this story reported by the Carthaginians\r\nthemselves, who therein relate that which is probable in itself, namely\r\nthat while the Barbarians fought with the Hellenes in Sicily from the\r\nearly morning till late in the afternoon (for to such a length the\r\ncombat is said to have been protracted), during this time Amilcas was\r\nremaining in the camp and was making sacrifices to get good omens of\r\nsuccess, offering whole bodies of victims upon a great pyre: and when he\r\nsaw that there was a rout of his own army, he being then, as it chanced,\r\nin the act of pouring a libation over the victims, threw himself into\r\nthe fire, and thus he was burnt up and disappeared. Amilcas then having\r\ndisappeared, whether it was in such a manner as this, as it is reported\r\nby the Phenicians, or in some other way, 159 the Carthaginians both\r\noffer sacrifices to him now, and also they made memorials of him then in\r\nall the cities of their colonies, and the greatest in Carthage itself.\r\n\r\n168. So far of the affairs of Sicily: and as for the Corcyreans, they\r\nmade answer to the envoys as follows, afterwards acting as I shall tell:\r\nfor the same men who had gone to Sicily endeavoured also to obtain the\r\nhelp of these, saying the same things which they said to Gelon; and\r\nthe Corcyreans at the time engaged to send a force and to help in the\r\ndefence, declaring that they must not permit Hellas to be ruined without\r\nan effort on their part, for if it should suffer disaster, they would\r\nbe reduced to subjection from the very first day; but they must give\r\nassistance so far as lay in their power. Thus speciously they made\r\nreply; but when the time came to send help, they manned sixty ships,\r\nhaving other intentions in their minds, and after making much difficulty\r\nthey put out to sea and reached Peloponnese; and then near Pylos and\r\nTainaron in the land of the Lacedemonians they kept their ships at\r\nanchor, waiting, as Gelon did, to see how the war would turn out: for\r\nthey did not expect that the Hellenes would overcome, but thought that\r\nthe Persian would gain the victory over them with ease and be ruler of\r\nall Hellas. Accordingly they were acting of set purpose, in order that\r\nthey might be able to say to the Persian some such words as these: \"O\r\nking, when the Hellenes endeavoured to obtain our help for this war,\r\nwe, who have a power which is not the smallest of all, and could have\r\nsupplied a contingent of ships in number not the smallest, but after the\r\nAthenians the largest, did not choose to oppose thee or to do anything\r\nwhich was not to thy mind.\" By speaking thus they hoped that they would\r\nobtain some advantage over the rest, and so it would have happened, as\r\nI am of opinion: while they had for the Hellenes an excuse ready made,\r\nthat namely of which they actually made use: for when the Hellenes\r\nreproached them because they did not come to help, they said that they\r\nhad manned sixty triremes, but had not been able to get past Malea\r\nowing to the Etesian Winds; therefore it was that they had not come to\r\nSalamis, nor was it by any want of courage on their part that they had\r\nbeen left of the sea-fight.\r\n\r\n169. These then evaded the request of the Hellenes thus: but the\r\nCretans, when those of the Hellenes who had been appointed to deal with\r\nthese endeavoured to obtain their help, did thus, that is to say, they\r\njoined together and sent men to inquire of the god at Delphi whether\r\nit would be better for them if they gave assistance to Hellas: and the\r\nPythian prophetess answered: \"Ye fools, do ye think those woes too\r\nfew, 160 which Minos sent upon you in his wrath, 161 because of the\r\nassistance that ye gave to Menelaos? seeing that, whereas they did\r\nnot join with you in taking vengeance for his death in Camicos, ye\r\nnevertheless joined with them in taking vengeance for the woman who by\r\na Barbarian was carried off from Sparta.\" When the Cretans heard this\r\nanswer reported, they abstained from the giving of assistance.\r\n\r\n170. For the story goes that Minos, having come to Sicania, which is now\r\ncalled Sicily, in search of Daidalos, died there by a violent death; and\r\nafter a time the Cretans, urged thereto by a god, all except the men of\r\nPolichne and Praisos, came with a great armament to Sicania and besieged\r\nfor seven years the city of Camicos, which in my time was occupied by\r\nthe Agrigentines; and at last not being able either to capture it or\r\nto remain before it, because they were hard pressed by famine, they\r\ndeparted and went away. And when, as they sailed, they came to be off\r\nthe coast of Iapygia, a great storm seized them and cast them away upon\r\nthe coast; and their vessels being dashed to pieces, they, since they\r\nsaw no longer any way of coming to Crete, founded there the city of\r\nHyria; and there they stayed and were changed so that they became\r\ninstead of Cretans, Messapians of Iapygia, and instead of islanders,\r\ndwellers on the mainland: then from the city of Hyria they founded those\r\nother settlements which the Tarentines long afterwards endeavoured to\r\ndestroy and suffer great disaster in that enterprise, so that this in\r\nfact proved to be the greatest slaughter of Hellenes that is known to\r\nus, and not only of the Tarentines themselves but of those citizens of\r\nRhegion who were compelled by Mikythos the son of Choiros to go to\r\nthe assistance of the Tarentines, and of whom there were slain in this\r\nmanner three thousand men: of the Tarentines themselves however, who\r\nwere slain there, there was no numbering made. This Mikythos, who was a\r\nservant of Anaxilaos, had been left by him in charge of Rhegion; and he\r\nit was who after being driven out of Rhegion took up his abode at Tegea\r\nof the Arcadians and dedicated those many statues at Olympia.\r\n\r\n171. This of the men of Rhegion and of the Tarentines has been an\r\nepisode 162 in my narrative: in Crete however, as the men of Praisos\r\nreport, after it had been thus stripped of inhabitants, settlements were\r\nmade by various nations, but especially by Hellenes; and in the next\r\ngeneration but one after the death of Minos came the Trojan war, in\r\nwhich the Cretans proved not the most contemptible of those who came to\r\nassist Menelaos. Then after this, when they had returned home from Troy,\r\nfamine and pestilence came upon both the men and their cattle, until at\r\nlast Crete was stripped of its inhabitants for the second time, and a\r\nthird population of Cretans now occupy it together with those which\r\nwere left of the former inhabitants. The Pythian prophetess, I say, by\r\ncalling these things to their minds stopped them from giving assistance\r\nto the Hellenes, though they desired to do so.\r\n\r\n172. As for the Thessalians, they at first had taken the side of the\r\nPersians against their will, and they gave proof that they were not\r\npleased by that which the Aleuadai were designing; for so soon as they\r\nheard that the Persian was about to cross over into Europe, they sent\r\nenvoys to the Isthmus: now at the Isthmus were assembled representatives\r\nof Hellas chosen by the cities which had the better mind about\r\nHellas: having come then to these, the envoys of the Thessalians\r\nsaid: \"Hellenes, ye must guard the pass by Olympos, in order that both\r\nThessaly and the whole of Hellas may be sheltered from the war. We are\r\nprepared to join with you in guarding it, but ye must send a large force\r\nas well as we; for if ye shall not send, be assured that we shall make\r\nagreement with the Persian; since it is not right that we, standing as\r\noutposts so far in advance of the rest of Hellas, should perish alone in\r\nyour defence: and not being willing 163 to come to our help, ye cannot\r\napply to us any force to compel inability; 164 but we shall endeavour to\r\ndevise some means of safety for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n173. Thus spoke the Thessalians; and the Hellenes upon this resolved to\r\nsend to Thessaly by sea an army of men on foot to guard the pass: and\r\nwhen the army was assembled it set sail through Euripos, and having\r\ncome to Alos in the Achaian land, it disembarked there and marched into\r\nThessaly leaving the ships behind at Alos, and arrived at Tempe,\r\nthe pass which leads from lower Macedonia into Thessaly by the river\r\nPeneios, going between the mountains of Olympos and Ossa. There the\r\nHellenes encamped, being assembled to the number of about ten thousand\r\nhoplites, and to them was added the cavalry of the Thessalians; and the\r\ncommander of the Lacedemonians was Euainetos the son of Carenos, who had\r\nbeen chosen from the polemarchs, 165 not being of the royal house, and\r\nof the Athenians Themistocles the son of Neocles. They remained however\r\nbut few days here, for envoys came from Alexander the son of Amyntas the\r\nMacedonian, who advised them to depart thence and not to remain in the\r\npass and be trodden under foot by the invading host, signifying to them\r\nat the same time both the great numbers of the army and the ships which\r\nthey had. When these gave them this counsel, they followed the advice,\r\nfor they thought that the counsel was good, and the Macedonian was\r\nevidently well-disposed towards them. Also, as I think, it was fear that\r\npersuaded them to it, when they were informed that there was another\r\npass besides this to the Thessalian land by upper Macedonia through\r\nthe Perraibians and by the city of Gonnos, the way by which the army of\r\nXerxes did in fact make its entrance. So the Hellenes went down to their\r\nships again and made their way back to the Isthmus.\r\n\r\n174. Such was the expedition to Thessaly, which took place when the king\r\nwas about to cross over from Asia to Europe and was already at Abydos.\r\nSo the Thessalians, being stripped of allies, upon this took the side of\r\nthe Medes with a good will and no longer half-heartedly, so that in the\r\ncourse of events they proved very serviceable to the king.\r\n\r\n175. When the Hellenes had returned to the Isthmus, they deliberated,\r\nhaving regard to that which had been said by Alexander, where and in\r\nwhat regions they should set the war on foot: and the opinion which\r\nprevailed was to guard the pass at Thermopylai; for it was seen to be\r\nnarrower than that leading into Thessaly, and at the same time it was\r\nsingle, 166 and nearer also to their own land; and as for the path by\r\nmeans of which were taken those of the Hellenes who were taken by the\r\nenemy at Thermopylai, they did not even know of its existence until\r\nthey were informed by the people of Trachis after they had come to\r\nThermopylai. This pass then they resolved to guard, and not permit the\r\nBarbarian to go by into Hellas; and they resolved that the fleet should\r\nsail to Artemision in the territory of Histiaia: for these points are\r\nnear to one another, so that each division of their forces could have\r\ninformation of what was happening to the other. And the places are so\r\nsituated as I shall describe.\r\n\r\n176. As to Artemision first, coming out of the Thracian Sea the space\r\nis contracted from great width to that narrow channel which lies between\r\nthe island of Skiathos and the mainland of Magnesia; and after the\r\nstrait there follows at once in Euboea the sea-beach called Artemision,\r\nupon which there is a temple of Artemis. Then secondly the passage into\r\nHellas by Trechis is, where it is narrowest, but fifty feet wide: it is\r\nnot here however that the narrowest part of this whole region lies,\r\nbut in front of Thermopylai and also behind it, consisting of a single\r\nwheel-track only 167 both by Alpenoi, which lies behind Thermopylai and\r\nagain by the river Phoinix near the town of Anthela there is no space\r\nbut a single wheel-track only: and on the West of Thermopylai there is\r\na mountain which is impassable and precipitous, rising up to a great\r\nheight and extending towards the range of Oite, while on the East of the\r\nroad the sea with swampy pools succeeds at once. In this passage there\r\nare hot springs, which the natives of the place call the \"Pots,\" 168 and\r\nan altar of Heracles is set up near them. Moreover a wall had once been\r\nbuilt at this pass, and in old times there was a gate set in it; which\r\nwall was built by the Phokians, who were struck with fear because the\r\nThessalians had come from the land of the Thesprotians to settle in\r\nthe Aiolian land, the same which they now possess. Since then the\r\nThessalians, as they supposed, were attempting to subdue them, the\r\nPhokians guarded themselves against this beforehand; and at that time\r\nthey let the water of the hot springs run over the passage, that the\r\nplace might be converted into a ravine, and devised every means that the\r\nThessalians might not make invasion of their land. Now the ancient wall\r\nhad been built long before, and the greater part of it was by that time\r\nin ruins from lapse of time; the Hellenes however resolved to set it\r\nup again, and at this spot to repel the Barbarian from Hellas: and very\r\nnear the road there is a village called Alpenoi, from which the Hellenes\r\ncounted on getting supplies.\r\n\r\n177. These places then the Hellenes perceived to be such as their\r\npurpose required; for they considered everything beforehand and\r\ncalculated that the Barbarians would not be able to take advantage\r\neither of superior numbers or of cavalry, and therefore they resolved\r\nhere to receive the invader of Hellas: and when they were informed that\r\nthe Persian was in Pieria, they broke up from the Isthmus and set forth\r\nfor the campaign, some going to Thermopylai by land, and others making\r\nfor Artemision by sea.\r\n\r\n178. The Hellenes, I say, were coming to the rescue with speed, having\r\nbeen appointed to their several places: and meanwhile the men of Delphi\r\nconsulted the Oracle of the god on behalf of themselves and on behalf\r\nof Hellas, being struck with dread; and a reply was given them that they\r\nshould pray to the Winds, for these would be powerful helpers of Hellas\r\nin fight. So the Delphians, having accepted the oracle, first reported\r\nthe answer which had been given them to those of the Hellenes who\r\ndesired to be free; and having reported this to them at a time when they\r\nwere in great dread of the Barbarian, they laid up for themselves\r\nan immortal store of gratitude: then after this the men of Delphi\r\nestablished an altar for the Winds in Thuia, where is the sacred\r\nenclosure of Thuia the daughter of Kephisos, after whom moreover this\r\nplace has its name; and also they approached them with sacrifices.\r\n\r\n179. The Delphians then according to the oracle even to this day make\r\npropitiary offerings to the Winds: and meanwhile the fleet of Xerxes\r\nsetting forth from the city of Therma had passed over with ten of its\r\nships, which were those that sailed best, straight towards Skiathos,\r\nwhere three Hellenic ships, a Troizenian, an Eginetan and an Athenian,\r\nwere keeping watch in advance. When the crews of these caught sight of\r\nthe ships of the Barbarians, they set off to make their escape:\r\n\r\n180, and the ship of Troizen, of which Prexinos was in command, was\r\npursued and captured at once by the Barbarians; who upon that took the\r\nman who was most distinguished by beauty among the fighting-men on board\r\nof her, 169 and cut his throat at the prow of the ship, making a good\r\nomen for themselves of the first of the Hellenes whom they had captured\r\nwho was pre-eminent for beauty. The name of this man who was sacrificed\r\nwas Leon, and perhaps he had also his name to thank in some degree for\r\nwhat befell him.\r\n\r\n181. The ship of Egina however, of which Asonides was master, even\r\ngave them some trouble to capture it, seeing that Pytheas the son of\r\nIschenoös served as a fighting-man on board of her, who proved himself a\r\nmost valiant man on this day; for when the ship was being taken, he\r\nheld out fighting until he was hacked all to pieces: and as when he had\r\nfallen he did not die, but had still breath in him, the Persians who\r\nserved as fighting-men on board the ships, because of his valour used\r\nall diligence to save his life, both applying unguents of myrrh to heal\r\nhis wounds and also wrapping him up in bands of the finest linen; and\r\nwhen they came back to their own main body, they showed him to all the\r\narmy, making a marvel of him and giving him good treatment; but the rest\r\nwhom they had taken in this ship they treated as slaves.\r\n\r\n182. Two of the three ships, I say, were captured thus; but the third,\r\nof which Phormos an Athenian was master, ran ashore in its flight at\r\nthe mouth of the river Peneios; and the Barbarians got possession of\r\nthe vessel but not of the crew; for so soon as the Athenians had run the\r\nship ashore, they leapt out of her, and passing through Thessaly made\r\ntheir way to Athens.\r\n\r\n183. Of these things the Hellenes who were stationed at Artemision were\r\ninformed by fire-signals from Skiathos; and being informed of them\r\nand being struck with fear, they removed their place of anchorage from\r\nAtermision to Chalkis, intending to guard the Euripos, but leaving at\r\nthe same time watchers by day 170 on the heights of Euboea. Of the ten\r\nships of the Barbarians three sailed up to the reef called Myrmex, 171\r\nwhich lies between Skiathos and Magnesia; and when the Barbarians had\r\nthere erected a stone pillar, which for that purpose they brought to\r\nthe reef, they set forth with their main body 172 from Therma, the\r\ndifficulties of the passage having now been cleared away, and sailed\r\nthither with all their ships, having let eleven days go by since the\r\nking set forth on his march from Therma. Now of this reef lying exactly\r\nin the middle of the fairway they were informed by Pammon of Skyros.\r\nSailing then throughout the day the Barbarians accomplished the voyage\r\nto Sepias in Magnesia and to the sea-beach which is between the city of\r\nCasthanaia and the headland of Sepias.\r\n\r\n184. So far as this place and so far as Thermopylai the army was exempt\r\nfrom calamity; and the number was then still, as I find by computation,\r\nthis:--Of the ships which came from Asia, which were one thousand two\r\nhundred and seven, the original number of the crews supplied by the\r\nseveral nations I find to have been twenty-four myriads and also in\r\naddition to them one thousand four hundred, 173 if one reckons at the\r\nrate of two hundred men to each ship: and on board of each of these\r\nships there served as fighting-men, 174 besides the fighting-men\r\nbelonging to its own nation in each case, thirty men who were Persians,\r\nMedes, or Sacans; and this amounts to three myriads six thousand two\r\nhundred and ten 175 in addition to the others. I will add also to this\r\nand to the former number the crews of the fifty-oared galleys, assuming\r\nthat there were eighty men, more or less, 176 in each one. Of these\r\nvessels there were gathered together, as was before said, three\r\nthousand: it would follow therefore that there were in them\r\nfour-and-twenty myriads 177 of men. This was the naval force which came\r\nfrom Asia, amounting in all to fifty-one myriads and also seven thousand\r\nsix hundred and ten in addition. 178 Then of the footmen there had been\r\nfound to be a hundred and seventy myriads, 179 and of the horsemen eight\r\nmyriads: 180 and I will add also to these the Arabian camel-drivers\r\nand the Libyan drivers of chariots, assuming them to amount to twenty\r\nthousand men. The result is then that the number of the ships'\r\ncrews combined with that of the land-army amounts to two hundred and\r\nthirty-one myriads and also in addition seven thousand six hundred and\r\nten. 181 This is the statement of the Army which was brought up out of\r\nAsia itself, without counting the attendants which accompanied it or the\r\ncorn-transports and the men who sailed in these.\r\n\r\n185. There is still to be reckoned, in addition to all this which has\r\nbeen summed up, the force which was being led from Europe; and of this\r\nwe must give a probable estimate. 182 The Hellenes of Thrace and of the\r\nislands which lie off the coast of Thrace supplied a hundred and twenty\r\nships; from which ships there results a sum of twenty-four thousand\r\nmen: and as regards the land-force which was supplied by the Thracians,\r\nPaionians, Eordians, Bottiaians, the race which inhabits Chalkidike, the\r\nBrygians, Pierians, Macedonians, Perraibians, Enianians, 183 Dolopians,\r\nMagnesians, Achaians, and all those who dwell in the coast-region of\r\nThrace, of these various nations I estimate that there were thirty\r\nmyriads. 184 These myriads then added to those from Asia make a total\r\nsum of two hundred and sixty-four myriads of fighting men and in\r\naddition to these sixteen hundred and ten. 185\r\n\r\n186. Such being the number of this body of fighting-men, 186 the\r\nattendants who went with these and the men who were in the small vessels\r\n187 which carried corn, and again in the other vessels which sailed\r\nwith the army, these I suppose were not less in number but more than\r\nthe fighting men. I assume them to be equal in number with these, and\r\nneither at all more nor less; and so, being supposed equal in number\r\nwith the fighting body, they make up the same number of myriads as they.\r\nThus five hundred and twenty-eight myriads three thousand two hundred\r\nand twenty 188 was the number of men whom Xerxes son of Dareios led as\r\nfar as Sepias and Thermopylai.\r\n\r\n187. This is the number of the whole army of Xerxes; but of the women\r\nwho made bread for it, and of the concubines and eunuchs no man can\r\nstate any exact number, nor again of the draught-animals and other\r\nbeasts of burden or of the Indian hounds, which accompanied it, could\r\nany one state the number by reason of their multitude: so that it does\r\nnot occur to me to wonder that the streams of some rivers should have\r\nfailed them, but I wonder rather how the provisions were sufficient\r\nto feed so many myriads; for I find on computation that if each man\r\nreceived a quart 189 of wheat every day and nothing more, there would be\r\nexpended every day eleven myriads of medimnoi 190 and three hundred and\r\nforty medimnoi besides: and here I am not reckoning anything for the\r\nwomen, eunuchs, baggage-animals, or dogs. Of all these men, amounting\r\nto so many myriads, not one was for beauty and stature more worthy than\r\nXerxes himself to possess this power.\r\n\r\n188. The fleet, I say, set forth and sailed: and when it had put in to\r\nland in the region of Magnesia at the beach which is between the city of\r\nCasthanaia and the headland of Sepias, the first of the ships which came\r\nlay moored by the land and the others rode at anchor behind them; for,\r\nas the beach was not large in extent, they lay at anchor with prows\r\nprojecting 191 towards the sea in an order which was eight ships deep.\r\nFor that night they lay thus; but at early dawn, after clear sky and\r\nwindless calm, the sea began to be violently agitated and a great storm\r\nfell upon them with a strong East 192 Wind, that wind which they who\r\ndwell about those parts call Hellespontias. Now as many of them as\r\nperceived that the wind was rising and who were so moored that it was\r\npossible for them to do so, drew up their ships on land before the storm\r\ncame, and both they and their ships escaped; but as for those of the\r\nships which it caught out at sea, some it cast away at the place called\r\nIpnoi 193 in Pelion and others on the beach, while some were wrecked\r\non the headland of Sepias itself, others at the city of Meliboia, and\r\nothers were thrown up on shore 194 at Casthanaia: and the violence of\r\nthe storm could not be resisted.\r\n\r\n189. There is a story reported that the Athenians had called upon Boreas\r\nto aid them, by suggestion of an oracle, because there had come to them\r\nanother utterance of the god bidding them call upon their brother by\r\nmarriage to be their helper. Now according to the story of the\r\nHellenes Boreas has a wife who is of Attica, Oreithuia the daughter\r\nof Erechththeus. By reason of this affinity, I say, the Athenians,\r\naccording to the tale which has gone abroad, conjectured that their\r\n\"brother by marriage\" was Boreas, and when they perceived the wind\r\nrising, as they lay with their ships at Chalkis in Euboea, or even\r\nbefore that, they offered sacrifices and called upon Boreas and\r\nOreithuia to assist them and to destroy the ships of the Barbarians, as\r\nthey had done before round about mount Athos. Whether it was for this\r\nreason that the wind Boreas fell upon the Barbarians while they lay at\r\nanchor, I am not able to say; but however that may be, the Athenians\r\nreport that Boreas had come to their help in former times, and that at\r\nthis time he accomplished those things for them of which I speak; and\r\nwhen they had returned home they set up a temple dedicated to Boreas by\r\nthe river Ilissos.\r\n\r\n190. In this disaster the number of the ships which were lost was not\r\nless than four hundred, according to the report of those who state the\r\nnumber which is lowest, with men innumerable and an immense quantity\r\nof valuable things; insomuch that to Ameinocles the son of Cretines,\r\na Magnesian who held lands about Sepias, this shipwreck proved very\r\ngainful; for he picked up many cups of gold which were thrown\r\nup afterwards on the shore, and many also of silver, and found\r\ntreasure-chests 195 which had belonged to the Persians, and made\r\nacquisition of other things of gold 196 more than can be described. This\r\nman however, though he became very wealthy by the things which he found,\r\nyet in other respects was not fortunate; for he too suffered misfortune,\r\nbeing troubled by the slaying of a child. 197\r\n\r\n191. Of the corn-transports and other vessels which perished there was\r\nno numbering made; and so great was the loss that the commanders of the\r\nfleet, being struck with fear lest the Thessalians should attack them\r\nnow that they had been brought into an evil plight, threw round their\r\ncamp a lofty palisade built of the fragments of wreck. For the storm\r\ncontinued during three days; but at last the Magians, making sacrifice\r\nof victims and singing incantations to appease the Wind by enchantments,\r\n198 and in addition to this, offering to Thetis and the Nereïds, caused\r\nit to cease on the fourth day, or else for some other reason it abated\r\nof its own will. Now they offered sacrifice to Thetis, being informed\r\nby the Ionians of the story that she was carried off from the place by\r\nPeleus, and that the whole headland of Sepias belonged to her and to the\r\nother Nereïds.\r\n\r\n192. The storm then had ceased on the fourth day; and meanwhile the\r\nday-watchers had run down from the heights of Euboea on the day after\r\nthe first storm began, and were keeping the Hellenes informed of all\r\nthat had happened as regards the shipwreck. They then, being informed of\r\nit, prayed first to Poseidon the Saviour and poured libations, and then\r\nthey hastened to go back to Artemision, expecting that there would be\r\nbut a very few ships of the enemy left to come against them.\r\n\r\n193. They, I say, came for the second time and lay with their ships\r\nabout Artemision: and from that time even to this they preserve the use\r\nof the surname \"Saviour\" for Poseidon. Meanwhile the Barbarians, when\r\nthe wind had ceased and the swell of the sea had calmed down, drew their\r\nships into the sea and sailed on along the shore of the mainland, and\r\nhaving rounded the extremity of Magnesia they sailed straight into the\r\ngulf which leads towards Pagasai. In this gulf of Magnesia there is a\r\nplace where it is said that Heracles was left behind by Jason and his\r\ncomrades, having been sent from the Argo to fetch water, at the time\r\nwhen they were sailing for the fleece to Aia in the land of Colchis: for\r\nfrom that place they designed, when they had taken in water, to loose\r\n199 their ship into the open sea; and from this the place has come\r\nto have the name Aphetai. Here then the fleet of Xerxes took up its\r\nmoorings.\r\n\r\n194. Now it chanced that fifteen of these ships put out to sea a good\r\ndeal later than the rest, and they happened to catch sight of the ships\r\nof the Hellenes at Artemision. These ships the Barbarians supposed to be\r\ntheir own, and they sailed thither accordingly and fell among the enemy.\r\nOf these the commander was Sandokes the son of Thamasios, the governor\r\nof Kyme in Aiolia, whom before this time king Dareios had taken and\r\ncrucified (he being one of the Royal Judges) for this reason, 19901\r\nnamely that Sandokes had pronounced judgment unjustly for money. So then\r\nafter he was hung up, Dareios reckoned and found that more good services\r\nhad been done by him to the royal house than were equal to his offences;\r\nand having found this, and perceived that he had himself acted with more\r\nhaste than wisdom, he let him go. Thus he escaped from king Dareios, and\r\ndid not perish but survived; now, however, when he sailed in toward the\r\nHellenes, he was destined not to escape the second time; for when the\r\nHellenes saw them sailing up, perceiving the mistake which was being\r\nmade they put out against them and captured them without difficulty.\r\n\r\n195. Sailing in one of these ships Aridolis was captured, the despot of\r\nAlabanda in Caria, and in another the Paphian commander Penthylos son of\r\nDemonoös, who brought twelve ships from Paphos, but had lost eleven\r\nof them in the storm which had come on by Sepias, and now was captured\r\nsailing in towards Artemision with the one which had escaped. These men\r\nthe Hellenes sent away in bonds to the Isthmus of the Corinthians, after\r\nhaving inquired of them that which they desired to learn of the army of\r\nXerxes.\r\n\r\n196. The fleet of the Barbarians then, except the fifteen ships of which\r\nI said that Sandokes was in command, had arrived at Aphetai; and Xerxes\r\nmeanwhile with the land-army, having marched through Thessalia and\r\nAchaia, had already entered the land of the Malians two days before, 200\r\nafter having held in Thessaly a contest for his own horses, making trial\r\nalso of the Thessalian cavalry, because he was informed that it was the\r\nbest of all among the Hellenes; and in this trial the horses of Hellas\r\nwere far surpassed by the others. Now of the rivers in Thessalia the\r\nOnochonos alone failed to suffice by its stream for the drinking of\r\nthe army; but of the rivers which flow in Achaia even that which is the\r\nlargest of them, namely Epidanos, even this, I say, held out but barely.\r\n\r\n197. When Xerxes had reached Alos of Achaia, the guides who gave him\r\ninformation of the way, wishing to inform him fully of everything,\r\nreported to him a legend of the place, the things, namely, which have to\r\ndo with the temple of Zeus Laphystios; 201 how Athamas the son of Aiolos\r\ncontrived death for Phrixos, having taken counsel with Ino, and after\r\nthis how by command of an oracle the Achaians propose to his descendants\r\nthe following tasks to be performed:--whosoever is the eldest of this\r\nrace, on him they lay an injunction that he is forbidden to enter the\r\nCity Hall, 202 and they themselves keep watch; now the City Hall is\r\ncalled by the Achaians the \"Hall of the People\"; 203 and if he enter\r\nit, it may not be that he shall come forth until he is about to be\r\nsacrificed. They related moreover in addition to this, that many of\r\nthese who were about to be sacrificed had before now run away and\r\ndeparted to another land, because they were afraid; and if afterwards\r\nin course of time they returned to their own land and were caught,\r\nthey were placed 204 in the City Hall: and they told how the man is\r\nsacrificed all thickly covered with wreaths, and with what form of\r\nprocession he is brought forth to the sacrifice. This is done to the\r\ndescendants of Kytissoros the son of Phrixos, because, when the Achaians\r\nwere making of Athamas the son of Aiolos a victim to purge the sins of\r\nthe land according to the command of an oracle, and were just about to\r\nsacrifice him, this Kytissoros coming from Aia of the Colchians rescued\r\nhim; and having done so he brought the wrath of the gods upon his own\r\ndescendants. Having heard these things, Xerxes, when he came to the\r\nsacred grove, both abstained from entering it himself, and gave the\r\ncommand to his whole army to so likewise; and he paid reverence both to\r\nthe house and to the sacred enclosure of the descendants of Athamas.\r\n\r\n198. These then are the things which happened in Thessalia and in\r\nAchaia; and from these regions he proceeded to the Malian land, going\r\nalong by a gulf of the sea, in which there is an ebb and flow of the\r\ntide every day. Round about this gulf there is a level space, which in\r\nparts is broad but in other parts very narrow; and mountains lofty and\r\ninaccessible surrounding this place enclose the whole land of Malis and\r\nare called the rocks of Trachis. The first city upon this gulf as one\r\ngoes from Achaia is Antikyra, by which the river Spercheios flowing from\r\nthe land of the Enianians 205 runs out into the sea. At a distance of\r\ntwenty furlongs 206 or thereabouts from this river there is another,\r\nof which the name is Dyras; this is said to have appeared that it\r\nmight bring assistance to Heracles when he was burning: then again at\r\na distance of twenty furlongs from this there is another river called\r\nMelas.\r\n\r\n199. From this river Melas the city of Trachis is distant five furlongs;\r\nand here, in the parts where Trachis is situated, is even the widest\r\nportion of all this district, as regards the space from the mountains to\r\nthe sea; for the plain has an extent of twenty-two thousand plethra.\r\n207 In the mountain-range which encloses the land of Trachis there is a\r\ncleft to the South of Trachis itself; and through this cleft the river\r\nAsopos flows, and runs along by the foot of the mountain.\r\n\r\n200. There is also another river called Phoinix, to the South of the\r\nAsopos, of no great size, which flowing from these mountains runs out\r\ninto the Asopos; and at the river Phoinix is the narrowest place, for\r\nhere has been constructed a road with a single wheel-track only.\r\nThen from the river Phoinix it is a distance of fifteen furlongs to\r\nThermopylai; and in the space between the river Phoinix and Thermopylai\r\nthere is a village called Anthela, by which the river Asopos flows, and\r\nso runs out into the sea; and about this village there is a wide space\r\nin which is set up a temple dedicated to Demeter of the Amphictyons, and\r\nthere are seats for the Amphictyonic councillors and a temple dedicated\r\nto Amphictyon himself.\r\n\r\n201. King Xerxes, I say, was encamped within the region of Trachis in\r\nthe land of the Malians, and the Hellenes within the pass. This place is\r\ncalled by the Hellenes in general Thermopylai, but by the natives of the\r\nplace and those who dwell in the country round it is called Pylai. Both\r\nsides then were encamped hereabout, and the one had command of all that\r\nlies beyond Trachis 208 in the direction of the North Wind, and the\r\nothers of that which tends towards the South Wind and the mid-day on\r\nthis side of the continent. 209\r\n\r\n202. These were the Hellenes who awaited the attack of the Persian in\r\nthis place:--of the Spartans three hundred hoplites; of the men of\r\nTegea and Mantineia a thousand, half from each place, from Orchomenos\r\nin Arcadia a hundred and twenty, and from the rest of Arcadia a\r\nthousand,--of the Arcadians so many; from Corinth four hundred, from\r\nPhlius two hundred, and of the men of Mykene eighty: these were they who\r\ncame from the Peloponnese; and from the Boeotians seven hundred of the\r\nThespians, and of the Thebans four hundred.\r\n\r\n203. In addition to these the Locrians of Opus had been summoned to come\r\nin their full force, and of the Phokians a thousand: for the Hellenes\r\nhad of themselves sent a summons to them, saying by messengers that they\r\nhad come as forerunners of the others, that the rest of the allies\r\nwere to be expected every day, that their sea was safely guarded, being\r\nwatched by the Athenians and the Eginetans and by those who had been\r\nappointed to serve in the fleet, and that they need fear nothing: for\r\nhe was not a god, they said, who was coming to attack Hellas, but a man;\r\nand there was no mortal, nor would be any, with those fortunes evil\r\nhad not been mingled at his very birth, and the greatest evils for the\r\ngreatest men; therefore he also who was marching against them, being\r\nmortal, would be destined to fail of his expectation. They accordingly,\r\nhearing this, came to the assistance of the others at Trachis.\r\n\r\n204. Of these troops, although there were other commanders also\r\naccording to the State to which each belonged, yet he who was most held\r\nin regard and who was leader of the whole army was the Lacedemonian\r\nLeonidas son of Anaxandrides, son of Leon, son of Eurycratides, son of\r\nAnaxander, son of Eurycrates, son of Polydoros, son of Alcamenes, son of\r\nTeleclos, son of Archelaos, son of Hegesilaos, son of Doryssos, son of\r\nLeobotes, son of Echestratos, son of Agis, son of Eurysthenes, son of\r\nAristodemos, son of Aristomachos, son of Cleodaios, son of Hyllos,\r\nson of Heracles; who had obtained the kingdom of Sparta contrary to\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\n205. For as he had two brothers each older than himself, namely\r\nCleomenes and Dorieos, he had been far removed from the thought of\r\nbecoming king. Since however Cleomenes had died without male child, and\r\nDorieos was then no longer alive, but he also had brought his life to an\r\nend in Sicily, 210 thus the kingdom came to Leonidas, both because was\r\nof elder birth than Cleombrotos (for Cleombrotos was the youngest of the\r\nsons of Anaxandrides) and also because he had in marriage the daughter\r\nof Cleomenes. He then at this time went to Thermopylai, having chosen\r\nthe three hundred who were appointed by law 211 and men who chanced\r\nto have sons; and he took with him besides, before he arrived, those\r\nThebans whom I mentioned when I reckoned them in the number of the\r\ntroops, of whom the commander was Leontiades the son of Eurymachos: and\r\nfor this reason Leonidas was anxious to take up these with him of all\r\nthe Hellenes, namely because accusations had been strongly brought\r\nagainst them that they were taking the side of the Medes; therefore\r\nhe summoned them to the war, desiring to know whether they would send\r\ntroops with them or whether they would openly renounce the alliance of\r\nthe Hellenes; and they sent men, having other thoughts in their mind the\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n206. These with Leonidas the Spartans had sent out first, in order that\r\nseeing them the other allies might join in the campaign, and for fear\r\nthat they also might take the side of the Medes, if they heard that the\r\nSpartans were putting off their action. Afterwards, however, when they\r\nhad kept the festival, (for the festival of the Carneia stood in their\r\nway), they intended then to leave a garrison in Sparta and to come to\r\nhelp in full force with speed: and just so also the rest of the allies\r\nhad thought of doing themselves; for it chanced that the Olympic\r\nfestival fell at the same time as these events. Accordingly, since\r\nthey did not suppose that the fighting in Thermopylai would so soon be\r\ndecided, they sent only the forerunners of their force.\r\n\r\n207. These, I say, had intended to do thus: and meanwhile the Hellenes\r\nat Thermopylai, when the Persian had come near to the pass, were in\r\ndread, and deliberated about making retreat from their position. To the\r\nrest of the Peloponnesians then it seemed best that they should go to\r\nthe Peloponnese and hold the Isthmus in guard; but Leonidas, when the\r\nPhokians and Locrians were indignant at this opinion, gave his vote\r\nfor remaining there, and for sending at the same time messengers to the\r\nseveral States bidding them to come up to help them, since they were but\r\nfew to repel the army of the Medes.\r\n\r\n208. As they were thus deliberating, Xerxes sent a scout on horseback\r\nto see how many they were in number and what they were doing; for he had\r\nheard while he was yet in Thessaly that there had been assembled in\r\nthis place a small force, and that the leaders of it were Lacedemonians\r\ntogether with Leonidas, who was of the race of Heracles. And when the\r\nhorseman had ridden up towards their camp, he looked upon them and had\r\na view not indeed of the whole of their army, for of those which were\r\nposted within the wall, which they had repaired and were keeping a\r\nguard, it was not possible to have a view, but he observed those who\r\nwere outside, whose station was in front of the wall; and it chanced at\r\nthat time that the Lacedemonians were they who were posted outside.\r\nSo then he saw some of the men practising athletic exercises and\r\nsome combing their long hair: and as he looked upon these things he\r\nmarvelled, and at the same time he observed their number: and when he\r\nhad observed all exactly, he rode back unmolested, for no one attempted\r\nto pursue him and he found himself treated with much indifference. And\r\nwhen he returned he reported to Xerxes all that which he had seen.\r\n\r\n209. Hearing this Xerxes was not able to conjecture the truth about the\r\nmatter, namely that they were preparing themselves to die and to deal\r\ndeath to the enemy so far as they might; but it seemed to him that they\r\nwere acting in a manner merely ridiculous; and therefore he sent for\r\nDemaratos the son of Ariston, who was in his camp, and when he came,\r\nXerxes asked him of these things severally, desiring to discover what\r\nthis was which the Lacedemonians were doing: and he said: \"Thou didst\r\nhear from my mouth at a former time, when we were setting forth to go\r\nagainst Hellas, the things concerning these men; and having heard them\r\nthou madest me an object of laughter, because I told thee of these\r\nthings which I perceived would come to pass; for to me it is the\r\ngreatest of all ends to speak the truth continually before thee, O\r\nking. Hear then now also: these men have come to fight with us for the\r\npassage, and this is it that they are preparing to do; for they have a\r\ncustom which is as follows;--whenever they are about to put their lives\r\nin peril, then they attend to the arrangement of their hair. Be assured\r\nhowever, that if thou shalt subdue these and the rest of them which\r\nremain behind in Sparta, there is no other race of men which will await\r\nthy onset, O king, or will raise hands against thee: for now thou art\r\nabout to fight against the noblest kingdom and city of those which are\r\namong the Hellenes, and the best men.\" To Xerxes that which was said\r\nseemed to be utterly incredible, and he asked again a second time in\r\nwhat manner being so few they would fight with his host. He said; \"O\r\nking, deal with me as with a liar, if thou find not that these things\r\ncome to pass as I say.\"\r\n\r\n210. Thus saying he did not convince Xerxes, who let four days go by,\r\nexpecting always that they would take to flight; but on the fifth day,\r\nwhen they did not depart but remained, being obstinate, as he thought,\r\nin impudence and folly, he was enraged and sent against them the Medes\r\nand the Kissians, charging them to take the men alive and bring them\r\ninto his presence. Then when the Medes moved forward and attacked\r\nthe Hellenes, there fell many of them, and others kept coming up\r\ncontinually, and they were not driven back, though suffering great loss:\r\nand they made it evident to every man, and to the king himself not least\r\nof all, that human beings are many but men are few. This combat went on\r\nthroughout the day:\r\n\r\n211, and when the Medes were being roughly handled, then these retired\r\nfrom the battle, and the Persians, those namely whom the king called\r\n\"Immortals,\" of whom Hydarnes was commander, took their place and came\r\nto the attack, supposing that they at least would easily overcome the\r\nenemy. When however these also engaged in combat with the Hellenes,\r\nthey gained no more success than the Median troops but the same as they,\r\nseeing that they were fighting in a place with a narrow passage, using\r\nshorter spears than the Hellenes, and not being able to take advantage\r\nof their superior numbers. The Lacedemonians meanwhile were fighting\r\nin a memorable fashion, and besides other things of which they made\r\ndisplay, being men perfectly skilled in fighting opposed to men who were\r\nunskilled, they would turn their backs to the enemy and make a pretence\r\nof taking to flight; and the Barbarians, seeing them thus taking a\r\nflight, would follow after them with shouting and clashing of arms: then\r\nthe Lacedemonians, when they were being caught up, turned and faced\r\nthe Barbarians; and thus turning round they would slay innumerable\r\nmultitudes of the Persians; and there fell also at these times a few of\r\nthe Spartans themselves. So, as the Persians were not able to obtain any\r\nsuccess by making trial of the entrance and attacking it by divisions\r\nand every way, they retired back.\r\n\r\n212. And during these onsets it is said that the king, looking on, three\r\ntimes leapt up from his seat, struck with fear for his army. Thus they\r\ncontended then: and on the following day the Barbarians strove with no\r\nbetter success; for because the men opposed to them were few in number,\r\nthey engaged in battle with the expectation that they would be found to\r\nbe disabled and would not be capable any longer of raising their hands\r\nagainst them in fight. The Hellenes however were ordered by companies as\r\nwell as by nations, and they fought successively each in turn, excepting\r\nthe Phokians, for these were posted upon the mountain to guard the path.\r\nSo the Persians, finding nothing different from that which they had seen\r\non the former day, retired back from the fight.\r\n\r\n213. Then when the king was in a strait as to what he should do in the\r\nmatter before him, Epialtes the son of Eurydemos, a Malian, came to\r\nspeech with him, supposing that he would win a very great reward\r\nfrom the king; and this man told him of the path which leads over the\r\nmountain to Thermopylai, and brought about the destruction of those\r\nHellenes who remained in that place. Afterwards from fear of the\r\nLacedemonians he fled to Thessaly, and when he had fled, a price was\r\nproclaimed for his life by the Deputies, 212 when the Amphictyons\r\nmet for their assembly at Pylai. 213 Then some time afterwards having\r\nreturned to Antikyra he was slain by Athenades a man of Trachis. Now\r\nthis Athenades killed Epialtes for another cause, which I shall set\r\nforth in the following part of the history, 214 but he was honoured for\r\nit none the less by the Lacedemonians.\r\n\r\n214. Thus Epialtes after these events was slain: there is however\r\nanother tale told, that Onetes the son of Phanagoras, a man of Carystos,\r\nand Corydallos of Antikyra were those who showed the Persians the way\r\nround the mountain; but this I can by no means accept: for first we must\r\njudge by this fact, namely that the Deputies of the Hellenes did not\r\nproclaim a price for the lives of Onetes and Corydallos, but for that\r\nof Epialtes the Trachinian, having surely obtained the most exact\r\ninformation of the matter; and secondly we know that Epialtes was an\r\nexile from his country to avoid this charge. True it is indeed that\r\nOnetes might know of this path, even though he were not a Malian, if he\r\nhad had much intercourse with the country; but Epialtes it was who led\r\nthem round the mountain by the path, and him therefore I write down as\r\nthe guilty man.\r\n\r\n215. Xerxes accordingly, being pleased by that which Epialtes engaged\r\nto accomplish, at once with great joy proceeded to send Hydarnes and the\r\nmen of whom Hydarnes was commander; 215 and they set forth from the camp\r\nabout the time when the lamps are lit. This path of which we speak\r\nhad been discovered by the Malians who dwell in that land, and having\r\ndiscovered it they led the Thessalians by it against the Phokians, at\r\nthe time when the Phokians had fenced the pass with a wall and thus were\r\nsheltered from the attacks upon them: so long ago as this had the pass\r\nbeen proved by the Malians to be of no value. 216 And this path lies\r\nas follows:--it begins from the river Asopos, which flows through the\r\ncleft, and the name of this mountain and of the path is the same, namely\r\nAnopaia; and this Anopaia stretches over the ridge of the mountain and\r\nends by the town of Alpenos, which is the first town of the Locrians\r\ntowards Malis, and by the stone called Black Buttocks 217 and the seats\r\nof the Kercopes, where is the very narrowest part.\r\n\r\n217. By this path thus situated the Persians after crossing over the\r\nAsopos proceeded all through the night, having on their right hand the\r\nmountains of the Oitaians and on the left those of the Trachinians: and\r\nwhen dawn appeared, they had reached the summit of the mountain. In\r\nthis part of the mountain there were, as I have before shown, a thousand\r\nhoplites of the Phokians keeping guard, to protect their own country and\r\nto keep the path: for while the pass below was guarded by those whom I\r\nhave mentioned, the path over the mountain was guarded by the Phokians,\r\nwho had undertaken the business for Leonidas by their own offer.\r\n\r\n218. While the Persians were ascending they were concealed from these,\r\nsince all the mountain was covered with oak-trees; and the Phokians\r\nbecame aware of them after they had made the ascent as follows:--the day\r\nwas calm, and not a little noise was made by the Persians, as was likely\r\nwhen leaves were lying spread upon the ground under their feet; upon\r\nwhich the Phokians started up and began to put on their arms, and by\r\nthis time the Barbarians were close upon them. These, when they saw men\r\narming themselves, fell into wonder, for they were expecting that no one\r\nwould appear to oppose them, and instead of that they had met with an\r\narmed force. Then Hydarnes, seized with fear lest the Phokians should\r\nbe Lacedemonians, asked Epialtes of what people the force was; and\r\nbeing accurately informed he set the Persians in order for battle. The\r\nPhokians however, when they were hit by the arrows of the enemy, which\r\nflew thickly, fled and got away at once to the topmost peak of the\r\nmountain, fully assured that it was against them that the enemy had\r\ndesigned to come, 218 and here they were ready to meet death. These,\r\nI say, were in this mind; but the Persians meanwhile with Epialtes and\r\nHydarnes made no account of the Phokians, but descended the mountain\r\nwith all speed.\r\n\r\n219. To the Hellenes who were in Thermopylai first the soothsayer\r\nMegistias, after looking into the victims which were sacrificed,\r\ndeclared the death which was to come to them at dawn of day; and\r\nafterwards deserters brought the report 219 of the Persians having gone\r\nround. These signified it to them while it was yet night, and thirdly\r\ncame the day-watchers, who had run down from the heights when day was\r\nalready dawning. Then the Hellenes deliberated, and their opinions were\r\ndivided; for some urged that they should not desert their post, while\r\nothers opposed this counsel. After this they departed from their\r\nassembly, 220 and some went away and dispersed each to their several\r\ncities, while others of them were ready to remain there together with\r\nLeonidas.\r\n\r\n220. However it is reported also that Leonidas himself sent them away,\r\nhaving a care that they might not perish, but thinking that it was not\r\nseemly for himself and for the Spartans who were present to leave the\r\npost to which they had come at first to keep guard there. I am inclined\r\nrather to be of this latter opinion, 221 namely that because Leonidas\r\nperceived that the allies were out of heart and did not desire to face\r\nthe danger with him to the end, he ordered them to depart, but held that\r\nfor himself to go away was not honourable, whereas if he remained, a\r\ngreat fame of him would be left behind, and the prosperity of Sparta\r\nwould not be blotted out: for an oracle had been given by the Pythian\r\nprophetess to the Spartans, when they consulted about this war at the\r\ntime when it was being first set on foot, to the effect that either\r\nLacedemon must be destroyed by the Barbarians, or their king must lose\r\nhis life. This reply the prophetess gave them in hexameter verses, and\r\nit ran thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"But as for you, ye men who in wide-spaced Sparta inhabit,\r\n  Either your glorious city is sacked by the children of Perses,\r\n  Or, if it be not so, then a king of the stock Heracleian\r\n  Dead shall be mourned for by all in the boundaries of broad Lacedemon.\r\n  Him 222 nor the might of bulls nor the raging of lions shall hinder;\r\n  For he hath might as of Zeus; and I say he shall not be restrained,\r\n  Till one of the other of these he have utterly torn and divided.\" 223\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that Leonidas considering these things and desiring to\r\nlay up for himself glory above all the other Spartans, 224 dismissed the\r\nallies, rather than that those who departed did so in such disorderly\r\nfashion, because they were divided in opinion.\r\n\r\n221. Of this the following has been to my mind a proof as convincing as\r\nany other, namely that Leonidas is known to have endeavoured to dismiss\r\nthe soothsayer also who accompanied this army, Megistias the Acarnanian,\r\nwho was said to be descended from Melampus, that he might not perish\r\nwith them after he had declared from the victims that which was about\r\nto come to pass for them. He however when he was bidden to go would\r\nnot himself depart, but sent away his son who was with him in the army,\r\nbesides whom he had no other child.\r\n\r\n222. The allies then who were dismissed departed and went away, obeying\r\nthe word of Leonidas, and only the Thespians and the Thebans remained\r\nbehind with the Lacedemonians. Of these the Thebans stayed against their\r\nwill and not because they desired it, for Leonidas kept them, counting\r\nthem as hostages; but the Thespians very willingly, for they said that\r\nthey would not depart and leave Leonidas and those with him, but they\r\nstayed behind and died with them. The commander of these was Demophilos\r\nthe son of Diadromes.\r\n\r\n223. Xerxes meanwhile, having made libations at sunrise, stayed for\r\nsome time, until about the hour when the market fills, and then made\r\nan advance upon them; for thus it had been enjoined by Epialtes, seeing\r\nthat the descent of the mountain is shorter and the space to be passed\r\nover much less than the going round and the ascent. The Barbarians\r\naccordingly with Xerxes were advancing to the attack; and the Hellenes\r\nwith Leonidas, feeling that they were going forth to death, now advanced\r\nout much further than at first into the broader part of the defile; for\r\nwhen the fence of the wall was being guarded, 225 they on the former\r\ndays fought retiring before the enemy into the narrow part of the pass;\r\nbut now they engaged with them outside the narrows, and very many of\r\nthe Barbarians fell: for behind them the leaders of the divisions with\r\nscourges in their hands were striking each man, ever urging them on to\r\nthe front. Many of them then were driven into the sea and perished, and\r\nmany more still were trodden down while yet alive by one another, and\r\nthere was no reckoning of the number that perished: for knowing the\r\ndeath which was about to come upon them by reason of those who were\r\ngoing round the mountain, they 226 displayed upon the Barbarians all the\r\nstrength which they had, to its greatest extent, disregarding danger and\r\nacting as if possessed by a spirit of recklessness.\r\n\r\n224. Now by this time the spears of the greater number of them were\r\nbroken, so it chanced, in this combat, and they were slaying the\r\nPersians with their swords; and in this fighting fell Leonidas, having\r\nproved himself a very good man, and others also of the Spartans with\r\nhim, men of note, of whose names I was informed as of men who had proved\r\nthemselves worthy, and indeed I was told also the names of all the three\r\nhundred. Moreover of the Persians there fell here, besides many others\r\nof note, especially two sons of Dareios, Abrocomes and Hyperanthes, born\r\nto Dareios of Phratagune the daughter of Artanes: now Artanes was the\r\nbrother of king Dareios and the son of Hystaspes, the son of Arsames;\r\nand he in giving his daughter in marriage to Dareios gave also with her\r\nall his substance, because she was his only child.\r\n\r\n225. Two brothers of Xerxes, I say, fell here fighting; and meanwhile\r\nover the body of Leonidas there arose a great struggle between the\r\nPersians and the Lacedemonians, until the Hellenes by valour dragged\r\nthis away from the enemy and turned their opponents to flight four\r\ntimes. This conflict continued until those who had gone with Epialtes\r\ncame up; and when the Hellenes learnt that these had come, from that\r\nmoment the nature of the combat was changed; for they retired backwards\r\nto the narrow part of the way, and having passed by the wall they went\r\nand placed themselves upon the hillock, 227 all in a body together\r\nexcept only the Thebans: now this hillock is in the entrance, where\r\nnow the stone lion is placed for Leonidas. On this spot while defending\r\nthemselves with daggers, that is those who still had them left, and also\r\nwith hands and with teeth, they were overwhelmed by the missiles of\r\nthe Barbarians, some of these having followed directly after them and\r\ndestroyed the fence of the wall, while others had come round and stood\r\nabout them on all sides.\r\n\r\n226. Such were the proofs of valour given by the Lacedemonians and\r\nThespians; yet the Spartan Dienekes is said to have proved himself\r\nthe best man of all, the same who, as they report, uttered this saying\r\nbefore they engaged battle with the Medes:--being informed by one of\r\nthe men of Trachis that when the Barbarians discharged their arrows they\r\nobscured the light of the sun by the multitude of the arrows, so great\r\nwas the number of their host, he was not dismayed by this, but making\r\nsmall account of the number of the Medes, he said that their guest from\r\nTrachis brought them very good news, for if the Medes obscured the light\r\nof the sun, the battle against them would be in the shade and not in the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n227. This and other sayings of this kind they report that Dienekes the\r\nLacedemonian left as memorials of himself; and after him the bravest\r\nthey say of the Lacedemonians were two brothers Alpheos and Maron, sons\r\nof Orsiphantos. Of the Thespians the man who gained most honour was\r\nnamed Dithyrambos son of Harmatides.\r\n\r\n228. The men were buried where they fell; and for these, as well as for\r\nthose who were slain before being sent away 228 by Leonidas, there is an\r\ninscription which runs thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Here once, facing in fight three hundred myriads of foemen,\r\n    Thousands four did contend, men of the Peloponnese.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the inscription for the whole body; and for the Spartans\r\nseparately there is this:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Stranger, report this word, we pray, to the Spartans, that lying\r\n    Here in this spot we remain, faithfully keeping their laws.\" 229\r\n\r\nThis, I say, for the Lacedemonians; and for the soothsayer as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"This is the tomb of Megistias renowned, whom the Median foemen,\r\n    Where Sperchios doth flow, slew when they forded the stream;\r\n  Soothsayer he, who then knowing clearly the fates that were coming,\r\n    Did not endure in the fray Sparta's good leaders to leave.\"\r\n\r\nThe Amphictyons it was who honoured them with inscriptions and\r\nmemorial pillars, excepting only in the case of the inscription to\r\nthe soothsayer; but that of the soothsayer Megistias was inscribed by\r\nSimonides the son of Leoprepes on account of guest-friendship.\r\n\r\n229. Two of these three hundred, it is said, namely Eurystos and\r\nAristodemos, who, if they had made agreement with one another, might\r\neither have come safe home to Sparta together (seeing that they had\r\nbeen dismissed from the camp by Leonidas and were lying at Alpenoi with\r\ndisease of the eyes, suffering extremely), or again, if they had not\r\nwished to return home, they might have been slain together with the\r\nrest,--when they might, I say, have done either one of these two\r\nthings, would not agree together; but the two being divided in opinion,\r\nEurystos, it is said, when he was informed that the Persians had gone\r\nround, asked for his arms and having put them on ordered his Helot to\r\nlead him to those who were fighting; and after he had led him thither,\r\nthe man who had led him ran away and departed, but Eurystos plunged into\r\nthe thick of the fighting, and so lost his life: but Aristodemos was\r\nleft behind fainting. 230 Now if either Aristodemos had been ill 231\r\nalone, and so had returned home to Sparta, or the men had both of\r\nthem come back together, I do not suppose that the Spartans would have\r\ndisplayed any anger against them; but in this case, as the one of them\r\nhad lost his life and the other, clinging to an excuse which the first\r\nalso might have used, 232 had not been willing to die, it necessarily\r\nhappened that the Spartans had great indignation against Aristodemos.\r\n\r\n230. Some say that Aristodemos came safe to Sparta in this manner, and\r\non a pretext such as I have said; but others, that he had been sent as a\r\nmessenger from the camp, and when he might have come up in time to find\r\nthe battle going on, was not willing to do so, but stayed upon the road\r\nand so saved his life, while his fellow-messenger reached the battle and\r\nwas slain.\r\n\r\n231. When Aristodemos, I say, had returned home to Lacedemon, he\r\nhad reproach and dishonour; 233 and that which he suffered by way of\r\ndishonour was this,--no one of the Spartans would either give him light\r\nfor a fire or speak with him, and he had reproach in that he was called\r\nAristodemos the coward. 234\r\n\r\n232. He however in the battle at Plataia repaired all the guilt that was\r\ncharged against him: but it is reported that another man also survived\r\nof these three hundred, whose name was Pantites, having been sent as a\r\nmessenger to Thessaly, and this man, when he returned back to Sparta and\r\nfound himself dishonoured, is said to have strangled himself.\r\n\r\n233. The Thebans however, of whom the commander was Leontiades, being\r\nwith the Hellenes had continued for some time to fight against the\r\nking's army, constrained by necessity; but when they saw that the\r\nfortunes of the Persians were prevailing, then and not before, while the\r\nHellenes with Leonidas were making their way with speed to the hillock,\r\nthey separated from these and holding out their hands came near to the\r\nBarbarians, saying at the same time that which was most true, namely\r\nthat they were on the side of the Medes and that they had been among the\r\nfirst to give earth and water to the king; and moreover that they had\r\ncome to Thermopylai constrained by necessity, and were blameless for the\r\nloss which had been inflicted upon the king: so that thus saying they\r\npreserved their lives, for they had also the Thessalians to bear witness\r\nto these words. However, they did not altogether meet with good fortune,\r\nfor some had even been slain as they had been approaching, and when they\r\nhad come and the Barbarians had them in their power, the greater\r\nnumber of them were branded by command of Xerxes with the royal marks,\r\nbeginning with their leader Leontiades, the same whose son Eurymachos\r\nwas afterwards slain by the Plataians, when he had been made commander\r\nof four hundred Thebans and had seized the city of the Plataians. 235\r\n\r\n234. Thus did the Hellenes at Thermopylai contend in fight; and\r\nXerxes summoned Demaratos and inquired of him, having first said this:\r\n\"Demaratos, thou art a good man; and this I conclude by the truth of thy\r\nwords, for all that thou saidest turned out so as thou didst say. Now,\r\nhowever, tell me how many in number are the remaining Lacedemonians, and\r\nof them how many are like these in matters of war; or are they so even\r\nall of them?\" He said: \"O king, the number of all the Lacedemonians is\r\ngreat and their cities are many, but that which thou desirest to learn,\r\nthou shalt know. There is in Lacedemon the city of Sparta, having about\r\neight thousand men; and these are all equal to those who fought here:\r\nthe other Lacedemonians are not equal to these, but they are good men\r\ntoo.\" To this Xerxes said: \"Demaratos, in what manner shall we with\r\nleast labour get the better of these men? Come set forth to us this; for\r\nthou knowest the courses of their counsels, 236 seeing that thou wert\r\nonce their king.\"\r\n\r\n235. He made answer: \"O king, if thou dost in very earnest take counsel\r\nwith me, it is right that I declare to thee the best thing. What if thou\r\nshouldest send three hundred ships from thy fleet to attack the Laconian\r\nland? Now there is lying near it an island named Kythera, about which\r\nChilon, who was a very wise man among us, said that it would be a\r\ngreater gain for the Spartans that it should be sunk under the sea than\r\nthat it should remain above it; for he always anticipated that something\r\nwould happen from it of such a kind as I am now setting forth to thee:\r\nnot that he knew of thy armament beforehand, but that he feared equally\r\nevery armament of men. Let thy forces then set forth from this island\r\nand keep the Lacedemonians in fear; and while they have a war of their\r\nown close at their doors, there will be no fear for thee from them that\r\nwhen the remainder of Hellas is being conquered by the land-army, they\r\nwill come to the rescue there. Then after the remainder of Hellas has\r\nbeen reduced to subjection, from that moment the Lacedemonian power will\r\nbe left alone and therefore feeble. If however thou shalt not do this,\r\nI will tell thee what thou must look for. There is a narrow isthmus\r\nleading to the Peloponnese, and in this place thou must look that other\r\nbattles will be fought more severe than those which have taken place,\r\nseeing that all the Peloponnesians have sworn to a league against thee:\r\nbut if thou shalt do the other thing of which I spoke, this isthmus and\r\nthe cities within it will come over to thy side without a battle.\"\r\n\r\n236. After him spoke Achaimenes, brother of Xerxes and also commander\r\nof the fleet, who chanced to have been present at this discourse and was\r\nafraid lest Xerxes should be persuaded to do this: \"O king,\" he said,\r\n\"I see that thou art admitting the speech of a man who envies thy good\r\nfortune, or is even a traitor to thy cause: for in truth the Hellenes\r\ndelight in such a temper as this; they envy a man for his good luck, and\r\nthey hate that which is stronger than themselves. And if, besides other\r\nmisfortunes which we have upon us, seeing that four hundred of our ships\r\n237 have suffered wreck, thou shalt send away another three hundred from\r\nthe station of the fleet to sail round Peloponnese, then thy antagonists\r\nbecome a match for thee in fight; whereas while it is all assembled\r\ntogether our fleet is hard for them to deal with, and they will not be\r\nat all a match for thee: and moreover the whole sea-force will support\r\nthe land-force and be supported by it, if they proceed onwards together;\r\nbut if thou shalt divide them, neither wilt thou be of service to them\r\nnor they to thee. My determination is rather to set thy affairs in good\r\norder 238 and not to consider the affairs of the enemy, either where\r\nthey will set on foot the war or what they will do or how many in number\r\nthey are; for it is sufficient that they should themselves take thought\r\nfor themselves, and we for ourselves likewise: and if the Lacedemonians\r\ncome to stand against the Persians in fight, they will assuredly not\r\nheal the wound from which they are now suffering.\" 239\r\n\r\n237. To him Xerxes made answer as follows: \"Achaimenes, I think that\r\nthou speakest well, and so will I do; but Demaratos speaks that which he\r\nbelieves to be best for me, though his opinion is defeated by thine: for\r\nI will not certainly admit that which thou saidest, namely that he is\r\nnot well-disposed to my cause, judging both by what was said by him\r\nbefore this, and also by that which is the truth, namely that though one\r\ncitizen envies another for his good fortune and shows enmity to him by\r\nhis silence, 240 nor would a citizen when a fellow-citizen consulted him\r\nsuggest that which seemed to him the best, unless he had attained to a\r\ngreat height of virtue, and such men doubtless are few; yet guest-friend\r\nto guest-friend in prosperity is well-disposed as nothing else on\r\nearth, and if his friend should consult him, he would give him the best\r\ncounsel. Thus then as regards the evil-speaking against Demaratos, that\r\nis to say about one who is my guest-friend, I bid every one abstain from\r\nit in the future.\"\r\n\r\n238. Having thus said Xerxes passed in review the bodies of the dead;\r\nand as for Leonidas, hearing that he had been the king and commander of\r\nthe Lacedemonians he bade them cut off his head and crucify him. And\r\nit has been made plain to me by many proofs besides, but by none more\r\nstrongly than by this, that king Xerxes was enraged with Leonidas while\r\nalive more than with any other man on earth; for otherwise he would\r\nnever have done this outrage to his corpse; since of all the men whom I\r\nknow, the Persians are accustomed most to honour those who are good men\r\nin war. They then to whom it was appointed to do these things, proceeded\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n239. I will return now to that point of my narrative where it remained\r\nunfinished. 241 The Lacedemonians had been informed before all others\r\nthat the king was preparing an expedition against Hellas; and thus it\r\nhappened that they sent to the Oracle at Delphi, where that reply was\r\ngiven them which I reported shortly before this. And they got this\r\ninformation in a strange manner; for Demaratos the son of Ariston\r\nafter he had fled for refuge to the Medes was not friendly to the\r\nLacedemonians, as I am of opinion and as likelihood suggests supporting\r\nmy opinion; but it is open to any man to make conjecture whether he did\r\nthis thing which follows in a friendly spirit or in malicious triumph\r\nover them. When Xerxes had resolved to make a campaign against Hellas,\r\nDemaratos, being in Susa and having been informed of this, had a desire\r\nto report it to the Lacedemonians. Now in no other way was he able to\r\nsignify it, for there was danger that he should be discovered, but he\r\ncontrived thus, that is to say, he took a folding tablet and scraped off\r\nthe wax which was upon it, and then he wrote the design of the king upon\r\nthe wood of the tablet, and having done so he melted the wax and poured\r\nit over the writing, so that the tablet (being carried without writing\r\nupon it) might not cause any trouble to be given by the keepers of the\r\nroad. Then when it had arrived at Lacedemon, the Lacedemonians were not\r\nable to make conjecture of the matter; until at last, as I am informed,\r\nGorgo, the daughter of Cleomenes and wife of Leonidas, suggested a plan\r\nof which she had herself thought, bidding them scrape the wax and they\r\nwould find writing upon the wood; and doing as she said they found\r\nthe writing and read it, and after that they sent notice to the other\r\nHellenes. These things are said to have come to pass in this manner. 242\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO BOOK VII\r\n\r\n1 [ {kai ploia}, for transport of horses and also of provisions: however\r\nthese words are omitted in some of the best MSS.]\r\n\r\n2 [ {all ei}: this is the reading of the better class of MSS.

THE EIGHTH BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED URANIA\r\n\r\n1. Those of the Hellenes who had been appointed to serve in the fleet\r\nwere these:—the Athenians furnished a hundred and twenty-seven ships,\r\nand the Plataians moved by valour and zeal for the service, although\r\nthey had had no practice in seamanship, yet joined with the Athenians in\r\nmanning their ships. The Corinthians furnished forty ships, the\r\nMegarians twenty; the Chalkidians manned twenty ships with which the\r\nAthenians furnished them; 1 the Eginetans furnished eighteen ships, the\r\nSikyonians twelve, the Lacedemonians ten, the Epidaurians eight, the\r\nEretrians seven, the Troizenians five, the Styrians two, the Keïans two\r\nships 2 and two fifty-oared galleys, while the Locrians of Opus came\r\nalso to the assistance of the rest with seven fifty-oared galleys.\r\n\r\n2. These were those who joined in the expedition to Artemision, and I\r\nhave mentioned them according to the number 3 of the ships which they\r\nseverally supplied: so the number of the ships which were assembled\r\nat Artemision was (apart from the fifty-oared galleys) two hundred and\r\nseventy-one: and the commander who had the supreme power was furnished\r\nby the Spartans, namely Eurybiades son of Eurycleides, since the allies\r\nsaid that they would not follow the lead of the Athenians, but unless a\r\nLacedemonian were leader they would break up the expedition which was to\r\nbe made:\r\n\r\n3, for it had come to be said at first, even before they sent to Sicily\r\nto obtain allies, that the fleet ought to be placed in the charge of the\r\nAthenians. So as the allies opposed this, the Athenians yielded, having\r\nit much at heart that Hellas should be saved, and perceiving that if\r\nthey should have disagreement with one another about the leadership,\r\nHellas would perish: and herein they judged rightly, for disagreement\r\nbetween those of the same race is worse than war undertaken with one\r\nconsent by as much as war is worse than peace. Being assured then of\r\nthis truth, they did not contend, but gave way for so long time as they\r\nwere urgently in need of the allies; and that this was so their conduct\r\nproved; for when, after repelling the Persian from themselves, they were\r\nnow contending for his land and no longer for their own, they alleged\r\nthe insolence of Pausanias as a pretext and took away the leadership\r\nfrom the Lacedemonians. This however took place afterwards.\r\n\r\n4. But at this time these Hellenes also who had come to Artemision, 4\r\nwhen they saw that a great number of ships had put in to Aphetai and\r\nthat everything was filled with their armament, were struck with fear,\r\nbecause the fortunes of the Barbarians had different issue from\r\nthat which they expected, and they deliberated about retreating from\r\nArtemision to the inner parts of Hellas. And the Euboeans perceiving\r\nthat they were so deliberating, asked Eurybiades to stay there by them\r\nfor a short time, until they should have removed out of their land their\r\nchildren, and their households; and as they did not persuade him, they\r\nwent elsewhere and persuaded Themistocles the commander of the Athenians\r\nby a payment of thirty talents, the condition being that the fleet\r\nshould stay and fight the sea-battle in front of Euboea.\r\n\r\n5. Themistocles then caused the Hellenes to stay in the following\r\nmanner:—to Eurybiades he imparted five talents of the sum with the\r\npretence that he was giving it from himself; and when Eurybiades had\r\nbeen persuaded by him to change his resolution, Adeimantos son of\r\nOkytos, the Corinthian commander, was the only one of all the others who\r\nstill made a struggle, saying that he would sail away from Artemision\r\nand would not stay with the others: to him therefore Themistocles said\r\nwith an oath: \"Thou at least shalt not leave us, for I will give thee\r\ngreater gifts than the king of the Medes would send to thee, if thou\r\nshouldest desert thy allies.\" Thus he spoke, and at the same time he\r\nsent to the ship of Adeimantos three talents of silver. So these all 5\r\nhad been persuaded by gifts to change their resolution, and at the same\r\ntime the request of the Euboeans had been gratified and Themistocles\r\nhimself gained money; and it was not known that he had the rest of the\r\nmoney, but those who received a share of this money were fully persuaded\r\nthat it had come from the Athenian State for this purpose.\r\n\r\n6. Thus they remained in Euboea and fought a sea-battle; and it came to\r\npass as follows:—when the Barbarians had arrived at Aphetai about the\r\nbeginning of the afternoon, having been informed even before they came\r\nthat a few ships of the Hellenes were stationed about Artemision and now\r\nseeing them for themselves, they were eager to attack them, to see if\r\nthey could capture them. Now they did not think it good yet to sail\r\nagainst them directly for this reason,—for fear namely that the\r\nHellenes, when they saw them sailing against them, should set forth to\r\ntake flight and darkness should come upon them in their flight; and so\r\nthey were likely (thought the Persians) 6 to get away; whereas it was\r\nright, according to their calculation, that not even the fire-bearer 7\r\nshould escape and save his life.\r\n\r\n7. With a view to this then they contrived as follows:—of the whole\r\nnumber of their ships they parted off two hundred and sent them round\r\nto sail by Caphereus and round Geriastos to the Euripos, going outside\r\nSkiathos so that they might not be sighted by the enemy as they sailed\r\nround Euboea: and their purpose was that with these coming up by that\r\nway, and blocking the enemies' retreat, and themselves advancing against\r\nthem directly, they might surround them on all sides. Having formed this\r\nplan they proceeded to send off the ships which were appointed for this,\r\nand they themselves had no design of attacking the Hellenes on that day\r\nnor until the signal agreed upon should be displayed to them by those\r\nwho were sailing round, to show that they had arrived. These ships, I\r\nsay, they were sending round, and meanwhile they were numbering the rest\r\nat Aphetai.\r\n\r\n8. During this time, while these were numbering their ships, it happened\r\nthus:—there was in that camp a man of Skione named Skyllias, as a diver\r\nthe best of all the men of that time, who also in the shipwreck which\r\ntook place by Pelion had saved for the Persians many of their goods and\r\nmany of them also he had acquired for himself: this Skyllias it appears\r\nhad had an intention even before this of deserting to the side of the\r\nHellenes, but it had not been possible for him to do so then. In what\r\nmanner after this attempt he did actually come to the Hellenes, I am not\r\nable to say with certainty, but I marvel if the tale is true which is\r\nreported; for it is said that he dived into the sea at Aphetai and did\r\nnot come up till he reached Artemision, having traversed here somewhere\r\nabout eighty furlongs through the sea. Now there are told about this man\r\nseveral other tales which seem likely to be false, but some also which\r\nare true: about this matter however let it be stated as my opinion that\r\nhe came to Artemision in a boat. Then when he had come, he forthwith\r\ninformed the commanders about the shipwreck, how it had come to pass,\r\nand of the ships which had been sent away to go round Euboea.\r\n\r\n9. Hearing this the Hellenes considered the matter with one another; and\r\nafter many things had been spoken, the prevailing opinion was that\r\nthey should remain there that day and encamp on shore, and then, when\r\nmidnight was past, they should set forth and go to meet those ships\r\nwhich were sailing round. After this however, as no one sailed out\r\nto attack them, they waited for the coming of the late hours of the\r\nafternoon and sailed out themselves to attack the Barbarians, desiring\r\nto make a trial both of their manner of fighting and of the trick of\r\nbreaking their line. 8\r\n\r\n10. And seeing them sailing thus against them with few ships, not only\r\nthe others in the army of Xerxes but also their commanders judged them\r\nto be moved by mere madness, and they themselves also put out their\r\nships to sea, supposing that they would easily capture them: and their\r\nexpectation was reasonable enough, since they saw that the ships of the\r\nHellenes were few, while theirs were many times as numerous and sailed\r\nbetter. Setting their mind then on this, they came round and enclosed\r\nthem in the middle. Then so many of the Ionians as were kindly disposed\r\nto the Hellenes and were serving in the expedition against their will,\r\ncounted it a matter of great grief to themselves when they saw them\r\nbeing surrounded and felt assured that not one of them would return\r\nhome, so feeble did they think the power of the Hellenes to be; while\r\nthose to whom that which was happening was a source of pleasure, were\r\nvying with one another, each one endeavouring to be the first to take an\r\nAthenian ship and receive gifts from the king: for in their camps there\r\nwas more report of the Athenians than of any others.\r\n\r\n11. The Hellenes meanwhile, when the signal was given, first set\r\nthemselves with prows facing the Barbarians and drew the sterns of their\r\nships together in the middle; and when the signal was given a second\r\ntime, although shut off in a small space and prow against prow, 9 they\r\nset to work vigorously; and they captured thirty ships of the Barbarians\r\nand also Philaon the son of Chersis, the brother of Gorgos kind of the\r\nSalaminians, who was a man of great repute in the army. Now the first of\r\nthe Hellenes who captured a ship of the enemy was an Athenian, Lycomedes\r\nthe son of Aischraios, and he received the prize for valour. So these,\r\nas they were contending in this sea-fight with doubtful result,\r\nwere parted from one another by the coming on of night. The Hellenes\r\naccordingly sailed away to Artemision and the Barbarians to Aphetai,\r\nthe contest having been widely different from their expectation. In this\r\nsea-fight Antidoros of Lemnos alone of the Hellenes who were with the\r\nking deserted to the side of the Hellenes, and the Athenians on account\r\nof this deed gave him a piece of land in Salamis.\r\n\r\n12. When the darkness had come on, although the season was the middle of\r\nsummer, yet there came on very abundant rain, which lasted through the\r\nwhole of the night, with crashing thunder 10 from Mount Pelion; and\r\nthe dead bodies and pieces of wreck were cast up at Aphetai and became\r\nentangled round the prows of the ships and struck against the blades of\r\nthe oars: and the men of the army who were there, hearing these things\r\nbecame afraid, expecting that they would certainly perish, to such\r\ntroubles had they come; for before they had had even breathing space\r\nafter the shipwreck and the storm which had arisen off Mount Pelion,\r\nthere had come upon them a hard sea-fight, and after the sea-fight a\r\nviolent storm of rain and strong streams rushing to the sea and crashing\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\n13. These then had such a night as I have said; and meanwhile those of\r\nthem who had been appointed to sail round Euboea experienced the very\r\nsame night, but against them it raged much more fiercely, inasmuch as it\r\nfell upon them while they were making their course in the open sea. And\r\nthe end of it proved distressful 11 to them; for when the storm and\r\nthe rain together came upon them as they sailed, being then off the\r\n\"Hollows\" of Euboea, 12 they were borne by the wind not knowing by what\r\nway they were carried, and were cast away upon the rocks. And all this\r\nwas being brought about by God in order that the Persian force might be\r\nmade more equal to that of the Hellenes and might not be by very much\r\nthe larger.\r\n\r\n14. These then, I say, were perishing about the Hollows of Euboea, and\r\nmeanwhile the Barbarians at Aphetai, when day had dawned upon them, of\r\nwhich they were glad, were keeping their ships quiet, and were satisfied\r\nin their evil plight to remain still for the present time; but to the\r\nHellenes there came as a reinforcement three-and-fifty Athenian ships.\r\nThe coming of these gave them more courage, and at the same time they\r\nwere encouraged also by a report that those of the Barbarians who had\r\nbeen sailing round Euboea had all been destroyed by the storm that had\r\ntaken place. They waited then for the same time of day as before, and\r\nthen they sailed and fell upon some Kilikian ships; and having destroyed\r\nthese, they sailed away when the darkness came on, and returned to\r\nArtemision.\r\n\r\n15. On the third day the commanders of the Barbarians, being exceedingly\r\nindignant that so small a number of ships should thus do them damage,\r\nand fearing what Xerxes might do, did not wait this time for the\r\nHellenes to begin the fight, but passed the word of command and put out\r\ntheir ships to sea about the middle of the day. Now it so happened that\r\nthese battles at sea and the battles on land at Thermopylai took place\r\non the same days; and for those who fought by sea the whole aim of the\r\nfighting was concerned with the channel of Euripos, just as the aim of\r\nLeonidas and of his band was to guard the pass: the Hellenes accordingly\r\nexhorted one another not to let the Barbarians go by into Hellas; while\r\nthese cheered one another on to destroy the fleet of the Hellenes and to\r\nget possession of the straits.\r\n\r\n16. Now while the forces of Xerxes were sailing in order towards them,\r\nthe Hellenes kept quiet at Artemision; and the Barbarians, having made a\r\ncrescent of their ships that they might enclose them, were endeavouring\r\nto surround them. Then the Hellenes put out to sea and engaged with\r\nthem; and in this battle the two sides were nearly equal to one another;\r\nfor the fleet of Xerxes by reason of its great size and numbers suffered\r\ndamage from itself, since the ships were thrown into confusion and ran\r\ninto one another: nevertheless it stood out and did not give way,\r\nfor they disdained to be turned to flight by so few ships. Many ships\r\ntherefore of the Hellenes were destroyed and many men perished, but many\r\nmore ships and men of the Barbarians. Thus contending they parted and\r\nwent each to their own place.\r\n\r\n17. In this sea-fight the Egyptians did best of the men who fought\r\nfor Xerxes; and these, besides other great deeds which they displayed,\r\ncaptured five ships of the Hellenes together with their crews: while of\r\nthe Hellenes those who did best on this day were the Athenians, and of\r\nthe Athenians Cleinias the son of Alkibiades, who was serving with two\r\nhundred man and a ship of his own, furnishing the expense at his own\r\nproper cost.\r\n\r\n18. Having parted, both sides gladly hastened to their moorings; and\r\nafter they had separated and got away out of the sea-fight, although the\r\nHellenes had possession of the bodies of the dead and of the wrecks\r\nof the ships, yet having suffered severely 13 (and especially\r\nthe Athenians, of whose ships half had been disabled), they were\r\ndeliberating now about retreating to the inner parts of Hellas.\r\n\r\n19. Themistocles however had conceived that if there should be detached\r\nfrom the force of the Barbarians the Ionian and Carian nations, they\r\nwould be able to overcome the rest; and when the people of Euboea were\r\ndriving their flocks down to that sea, 14 he assembled the generals and\r\nsaid to them that he thought he had a device by which he hoped to cause\r\nthe best of the king's allies to leave him. This matter he revealed to\r\nthat extent only; and with regard to their present circumstances, he\r\nsaid that they must do as follows:—every one must slaughter of the\r\nflocks of the Euboeans as many as he wanted, for it was better that\r\ntheir army should have them than the enemy; moreover he advised that\r\neach one should command his own men to kindle a fire: and as for the\r\ntime of their departure he would see to it in such wise that they should\r\ncome safe to Hellas. This they were content to do, and forthwith when\r\nthey had kindled a fire they turned their attention to the flocks.\r\n\r\n20. For in fact the Euboeans, neglecting the oracle of Bakis as if it\r\nhad no meaning at all, had neither carried away anything from their land\r\nnor laid in any store of provisions with a view to war coming upon them,\r\nand by their conduct moreover they had brought trouble upon themselves.\r\n15 For the oracle uttered by Bakis about these matters runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Mark, when a man, a Barbarian, shall yoke the Sea with papyrus,\r\n  Then do thou plan to remove the loud-bleating goats from Euboea.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evils which at this time were either upon them or soon to be\r\nexpected they might feel not a little sorry that they had paid no\r\nattention to these lines.\r\n\r\n21. While these were thus engaged, there came to them the scout from\r\nTrachis: for there was at Artemision a scout named Polyas, by birth\r\nof Antikyra, to whom it had been appointed, if the fleet should be\r\ndisabled, 16 to signify this to those at Thermopylai, and he had a\r\nvessel equipped and ready for this purpose; and similarly there was with\r\nLeonidas Abronichos son of Lysicles, an Athenian, ready to carry news to\r\nthose at Artemision with a thirty-oared galley, if any disaster should\r\nhappen to the land-army. This Abronichos then had arrived, and he\r\nproceeded to signify to them that which had come to pass about Leonidas\r\nand his army; and then when they were informed of it no longer put off\r\ntheir retreat, but set forth in the order in which they were severally\r\nposted, the Corinthians first and the Athenians last.\r\n\r\n22. Themistocles however selected those ships of the Athenians which\r\nsailed best, and went round to the springs of drinking-water, cutting\r\ninscriptions on the stones there, which the Ionians read when they\r\ncame to Artemision on the following day. These inscriptions ran thus:\r\n\"Ionians, ye act not rightly in making expedition against the fathers of\r\nyour race and endeavouring to enslave Hellas. Best of all were it that\r\nye should come and be on our side; but if that may not be done by you,\r\nstand aside even now from the combat against us and ask the Carians to\r\ndo the same as ye. If however neither of these two things is possible\r\nto be done, and ye are bound down by too strong compulsion to be able\r\nto make revolt, then in the action, when we engage battle, be purposely\r\nslack, remember that ye are descended from us and that our quarrel with\r\nthe Barbarian took its rise at the first from you.\" Themistocles wrote\r\nthus, having, as I suppose, two things together in his mind, namely that\r\neither the inscriptions might elude the notice of the king and cause\r\nthe Ionians to change and come over to the side on which he was, or\r\nthat having been reported and denounced to Xerxes they might cause the\r\nIonians to be distrusted by him, and so he might keep them apart from\r\nthe sea-fights.\r\n\r\n23. Themistocles then had set these inscriptions: and to the Barbarians\r\nthere came immediately after these things a man of Histaia in a boat\r\nbringing word of the retreat of the Hellenes from Artemision. They\r\nhowever, not believing it, kept the messenger under guard and sent\r\nswift-sailing ships to look on before. Then these having reported\r\nthe facts, at last as daylight was spreading over the sky, the whole\r\narmament sailed in a body to Artemision; and having stayed at this place\r\ntill mid-day, after this they sailed to Histaia, and there arrived they\r\ntook possession of the city of Histaia and overran all the villages\r\nwhich lie along the coast in the region of Ellopia, which is the land of\r\nHistaia.\r\n\r\n24. While they were there, Xerxes, after he had made his dispositions\r\nwith regard to the bodies of the dead, sent a herald to the fleet: and\r\nthe dispositions which he made beforehand were as follows:—for all those\r\nof his army who were lying dead at Thermopylai, (and there were as many\r\nas twenty thousand in all), with the exception of about a thousand whom\r\nhe left, he dug trenches and buried them, laying over them leaves and\r\nheaping earth upon them, that they might not be seen by the men of the\r\nfleet. Then when the herald had gone over to Histaia, he gathered an\r\nassembly of the whole force and spoke these words: \"Allies, king Xerxes\r\ngrants permission to any one of you who desires it, to leave his post\r\nand to come and see how he fights against those most senseless men who\r\nlooked to overcome the power of the king.\"\r\n\r\n25. When the herald had proclaimed this, then boats were of all things\r\nmost in request, so many were they who desired to see this sight; and\r\nwhen they had passed over they went through the dead bodies and looked\r\nat them: and every one supposed that those who were lying there were all\r\nLacedemonians or Thespians, though the Helots also were among those that\r\nthey saw: however, they who had passed over did not fail to perceive\r\nthat Xerxes had done that which I mentioned about the bodies of his own\r\ndead; for in truth it was a thing to cause laughter even: on the one\r\nside there were seen a thousand dead bodies lying, while the others\r\nlay all gathered together in the same place, four thousand 17 of them.\r\nDuring this day then they busied themselves with looking, and on the day\r\nafter this they sailed back to the ships at Histaia, while Xerxes and\r\nhis army set forth upon their march.\r\n\r\n26. There had come also to them a few deserters from Arcadia, men in\r\nwant of livelihood and desiring to be employed. These the Persians\r\nbrought into the king's presence and inquired about the Hellenes, what\r\nthey were doing; and one man it was who asked them this for all the\r\nrest. They told them that the Hellenes were keeping the Olympic festival\r\nand were looking on at a contest of athletics and horsemanship. He then\r\ninquired again, what was the prize proposed to them, for the sake of\r\nwhich they contended; and they told them of the wreath of olive which is\r\ngiven. Then Tigranes 18 the son of Artabanos uttered a thought which\r\nwas most noble, though thereby he incurred from the king the reproach\r\nof cowardice: for hearing that the prize was a wreath and not money, he\r\ncould not endure to keep silence, but in the presence of all he spoke\r\nthese words: \"Ah! Mardonios, what kind of men are these against whom\r\nthou hast brought us to fight, who make their contest not for money but\r\nfor honour!\" Thus was it spoken by this man.\r\n\r\n27. In the meantime, so soon as the disaster at Thermopylai had come\r\nabout, the Thessalians sent a herald forthwith to the Phokians, against\r\nwhom they had a grudge always, but especially because of the latest\r\ndisaster which they had suffered: for when both the Thessalians\r\nthemselves and their allies had invaded the Phokian land not many\r\nyears before this expedition of the king, they had been defeated by the\r\nPhokians and handled by them roughly. For the Phokians had been shut up\r\nin Mount Parnassos having with them a soothsayer, Tellias the Eleian;\r\nand this Tellias contrived for them a device of the following kind:—he\r\ntook six hundred men, the best of the Phokians, and whitened them over\r\nwith chalk, both themselves and their armour, and then he attacked the\r\nThessalians by night, telling the Phokians beforehand to slay every\r\nman whom they should see not coloured over with white. So not only the\r\nsentinels of the Thessalians, who saw these first, were terrified by\r\nthem, supposing it to be something portentous and other than it was,\r\nbut also after the sentinels the main body of their army; so that the\r\nPhokians remained in possession of four thousand bodies of slain men and\r\nshields; of which last they dedicated half at Abai and half at Delphi;\r\nand from the tithe of booty got by this battle were made the large\r\nstatues which are contending for the tripod in front of the temple 19\r\nat Delphi, and others similar to these are dedicated as an offering at\r\nAbai.\r\n\r\n28. Thus had the Phokians done to the Thessalian footmen, when they were\r\nbesieged by them; and they had done irreparable hurt to their cavalry\r\nalso, when this had invaded their land: for in the pass which is\r\nby Hyampolis they had dug a great trench and laid down in it empty\r\nwine-jars; and then having carried earth and laid it on the top and\r\nmade it like the rest of the ground, they waited for the Thessalians to\r\ninvade their land. These supposing that they would make short work with\r\nthe Phokians, 20 riding in full course fell upon the wine-jars; and\r\nthere the legs of their horses were utterly crippled.\r\n\r\n29. Bearing then a grudge for both of these things, the Thessalians sent\r\na herald and addressed them thus: \"Phokians, we advise you to be more\r\ndisposed now to change your minds and to admit that ye are not on a\r\nlevel with us: for in former times among the Hellenes, so long as it\r\npleased us to be on that side, we always had the preference over you,\r\nand now we have such great power with the Barbarian that it rests with\r\nus to cause you to be deprived of your land and to be sold into slavery\r\nalso. We however, though we have all the power in our hands, do not bear\r\nmalice, but let there be paid to us fifty talents of silver in return\r\nfor this, and we will engage to avert the dangers which threaten to come\r\nupon your land.\"\r\n\r\n30. Thus the Thessalians proposed to them; for the Phokians alone of\r\nall the people in those parts were not taking the side of the Medes,\r\nand this for no other reason, as I conjecture, but only because of their\r\nenmity with the Thessalians; and if the Thessalians had supported the\r\ncause of the Hellenes, I am of opinion that the Phokians would have been\r\non the side of the Medes. When the Thessalians proposed this, they said\r\nthat they would not give the money, and that it was open to them to take\r\nthe Median side just as much as the Thessalians, if they desired it for\r\nother reasons; but they would not with their own will be traitors to\r\nHellas.\r\n\r\n31. When these words were reported, then the Thessalians, moved with\r\nanger against the Phokians, became guides to the Barbarian to show him\r\nthe way: and from the land of Trachis they entered Doris; for a narrow\r\nstrip 21 of the Dorian territory extends this way, about thirty furlongs\r\nin breadth, lying between Malis and Phokis, the region which was in\r\nancient time called Dryopis; this land is the mother-country of the\r\nDorians in Peloponnese. Now the Barbarians did not lay waste this land\r\nof Doris when they entered it, for the people of it were taking the side\r\nof the Medes, and also the Thessalians did not desire it.\r\n\r\n32. When however from Doris they entered Phokis, they did not indeed\r\ncapture the Phokians themselves; for some of them had gone up to the\r\nheights of Parnassos,—and that summit of Parnassos is very convenient to\r\nreceive a large number, which lies by itself near the city of Neon, the\r\nname of it being Tithorea,—to this, I say, some of them had carried up\r\ntheir goods and gone up themselves; but most of them had conveyed their\r\ngoods out to the Ozolian Locrians, to the city of Amphissa, which is\r\nsituated above the Crissaian plain. The Barbarians however overran the\r\nwhole land of Phokis, for so the Thessalians led their army, and all\r\nthat they came to as they marched they burned or cut down, and delivered\r\nto the flames both the cities and the temples:\r\n\r\n33, for they laid everything waste, proceeding this way by the river\r\nKephisos, and they destroyed the city of Drymos by fire, and also\r\nthe following, namely Charadra, Erochos, Tethronion, Amphikaia, Neon,\r\nPedieis, Triteis, Elateia, Hyampolis, Parapotamioi and Abai, at which\r\nlast-named place there was a temple of Apollo, wealthy and furnished\r\nwith treasuries and votive offerings in abundance; and there was then,\r\nas there is even now, the seat of an Oracle there: this temple they\r\nplundered and burnt. Some also of the Phokians they pursued and captured\r\nupon the mountains, and some women they did to death by repeated\r\noutrage.\r\n\r\n34. Passing by Parapotamioi the Barbarians came to Panopeus, and from\r\nthis point onwards their army was separated and went different ways. The\r\nlargest and strongest part of the army, proceeding with Xerxes himself\r\nagainst Athens, entered the land of the Boeotians, coming into the\r\nterritory of Orchomenos. Now the general body of the Boeotians was\r\ntaking the side of the Medes, and their cities were being kept by\r\nMacedonians appointed for each, who had been sent by Alexander; and they\r\nwere keeping them this aim, namely in order to make it plain to Xerxes\r\nthat the Boeotians were disposed to be on the side of the Medes.\r\n\r\n35. These, I say, of the Barbarians took their way in this direction;\r\nbut others of them with guides had set forth to go to the temple at\r\nDelphi, keeping Parnassos on their right hand: and all the parts of\r\nPhokis over which these marched they ravaged; for they set fire to\r\nthe towns of Panopeus and Daulis and Aiolis. And for this reason they\r\nmarched in that direction, parted off from the rest of the army, namely\r\nin order that they might plunder the temple at Delphi and deliver over\r\nthe treasures there to king Xerxes: and Xerxes was well acquainted with\r\nall that there was in it of any account, better, I am told, than with\r\nthe things which he had left in his own house at home, seeing that many\r\nconstantly reported of them, and especially of the votive offerings of\r\nCroesus the son of Alyattes.\r\n\r\n36. Meanwhile the Delphians, having been informed of this, had been\r\nbrought to extreme fear; and being in great terror they consulted the\r\nOracle about the sacred things, whether they should bury them in the\r\nearth or carry them forth to another land; but the god forbade them to\r\nmeddle with these, saying that he was able by himself to take care of\r\nhis own. Hearing this they began to take thought for themselves, and\r\nthey sent their children and women over to Achaia on the other side\r\nof the sea, while most of the men themselves ascended up towards the\r\nsummits of Parnassos and carried their property to the Corykian cave,\r\nwhile others departed for refuge to Amphissa of the Locrians. In short\r\nthe Delphians had all left the town excepting sixty men and the prophet\r\nof the Oracle. 22\r\n\r\n37. When the Barbarians had come near and could see the temple, then the\r\nprophet, whose name was Akeratos, saw before the cell 23 arms lying\r\nlaid out, having been brought forth out of the sanctuary, 24 which were\r\nsacred and on which it was not permitted to any man to lay hands. He\r\nthen was going to announce the portent to those of the Delphians who\r\nwere still there, but when the Barbarians pressing onwards came opposite\r\nthe temple of Athene Pronaia, there happened to them in addition\r\nportents yet greater than that which had come to pass before: for though\r\nthat too was a marvel, that arms of war should appear of themselves laid\r\nforth outside the cell, yet this, which happened straightway after that,\r\nis worthy of marvel even beyond all other prodigies. When the Barbarians\r\nin their approach were opposite the temple of Athene Pronaia, at this\r\npoint of time from the heaven there fell thunderbolts upon them, and\r\nfrom Parnassos two crags were broken away and rushed down upon them with\r\na great crashing noise falling upon many of them, while from the temple\r\nof Pronaia there was heard a shout, and a battle-cry was raised.\r\n\r\n38. All these things having come together, there fell fear upon the\r\nBarbarians; and the Delphians having perceived that they were flying,\r\ncame down after them and slew a great number of them; and those who\r\nsurvived fled straight to Boeotia. These who returned of the Barbarians\r\nreported, as I am informed, that in addition to this which we have said\r\nthey saw also other miraculous things; for two men (they said) in\r\nfull armour and of stature more than human followed them slaying and\r\npursuing.\r\n\r\n39. These two the Delphians say were the native heroes Phylacos and\r\nAutonoös, whose sacred enclosures are about the temple, that of Phylacos\r\nbeing close by the side of the road above the temple of Pronaia and that\r\nof Autonoös near Castalia under the peak called Hyampeia. Moreover the\r\nrocks which fell from Parnassos were still preserved even to my time,\r\nlying in the sacred enclosure of Athene Pronaia, into which they fell\r\nwhen they rushed through the ranks of the Barbarians. Such departure had\r\nthese men from the temple.\r\n\r\n40. Meanwhile the fleet of the Hellenes after leaving Artemision put in\r\nto land at Salamis at the request of the Athenians: and for this reason\r\nthe Athenians requested them to put in to Salamis, namely in order that\r\nthey might remove out of Attica to a place of safety their children\r\nand their wives, and also deliberate what they would have to do; for in\r\ntheir present case they meant to take counsel afresh, because they had\r\nbeen deceived in their expectation. For they had thought to find the\r\nPeloponnesians in full force waiting for the Barbarians in Boeotia; they\r\nfound however nothing of this, but they were informed on the contrary\r\nthat the Peloponnesians were fortifying the Isthmus with a wall, valuing\r\nabove all things the safety of the Peloponnese and keeping this in\r\nguard; and that they were disposed to let all else go. Being informed of\r\nthis, the Athenians therefore made request of them to put in to Salamis.\r\n41. The others then put in their ships to land at Salamis, but the\r\nAthenians went over to their own land; and after their coming they made\r\na proclamation that every one of the Athenians should endeavour to save\r\nhis children and household as best he could. So the greater number sent\r\nthem to Troizen, but others to Egina, and others to Salamis, and they\r\nwere urgent to put these out of danger, both because they desired\r\nto obey the oracle and also especially for another reason, which was\r\nthis:—the Athenians say that a great serpent lives in the temple 25\r\nand guards the Acropolis; and they not only say this, but also they\r\nset forth for it monthly offerings, as if it were really there; and the\r\noffering consists of a honey-cake. This honey-cake, which before\r\nused always to be consumed, was at this time left untouched. When the\r\npriestess had signified this, the Athenians left the city much more and\r\nwith greater eagerness than before, seeing that the goddess also had (as\r\nthey supposed) left the Acropolis. Then when all their belongings had\r\nbeen removed out of danger, they sailed to the encampment of the fleet.\r\n\r\n42. When those who came from Artemision had put their ships in to land\r\nat Salamis, the remainder of the naval force of the Hellenes, being\r\ninformed of this, came over gradually to join them 26 from Troizen:\r\nfor they had been ordered beforehand to assemble at Pogon, which is the\r\nharbour of the Troizenians. There were assembled accordingly now many\r\nmore ships than those which were in the sea-fight at Artemision, and\r\nfrom more cities. Over the whole was set as admiral the same man as at\r\nArtemision, namely Eurybiades the son of Eurycleides, a Spartan but not\r\nof the royal house; the Athenians however supplied by far the greatest\r\nnumber of ships and those which sailed the best.\r\n\r\n43. The following were those who joined the muster:—From Peloponnese the\r\nLacedemonians furnishing sixteen ships, the Corinthians furnishing the\r\nsame complement as at Artemision, the Sikyonians furnishing fifteen\r\nships, the Epidaurians ten, the Troizenians five, the men of Hermion\r\n2601 three, these all, except the Hermionians, being of Doric and\r\nMakednian 27 race and having made their last migration from Erineos\r\nand Pindos and the land of Dryopis; 28 but the people of Hermion are\r\nDryopians, driven out by Heracles and the Malians from the land which is\r\nnow called Doris.\r\n\r\n44. These were the Peloponnesians who joined the fleet, and those of\r\nthe mainland outside the Peloponnese were as follows:—the Athenians,\r\nfurnishing a number larger than all the rest, 29 namely one hundred and\r\neighty ships, and serving alone, since the Plataians did not take\r\npart with the Athenians in the sea-fight at Salamis, because when the\r\nHellenes were departing from Artemision and come near Chalkis, the\r\nPlataians disembarked on the opposite shore of Boeotia and proceeded to\r\nthe removal of their households. So being engaged in saving these,\r\nthey had been left behind. As for the Athenians, in the time when\r\nthe Pelasgians occupied that which is now called Hellas, they were\r\nPelasgians, being named Cranaoi, and in the time of king Kecrops they\r\ncame to be called Kecropidai; then when Erechtheus had succeeded to his\r\npower, they had their name changed to Athenians; and after Ion the son\r\nof Xuthos became commander 30 of the Athenians, they got the name from\r\nhim of Ionians.\r\n\r\n45. The Megarians furnished the same complement as at Artermision; the\r\nAmprakiots came to the assistance of the rest with seven ships, and the\r\nLeucadians with three, these being by race Dorians from Corinth.\r\n\r\n46. Of the islanders the Eginetans furnished thirty; these had also\r\nother ships manned, but with them they were guarding their own land,\r\nwhile with the thirty which sailed best they joined in the sea-fight at\r\nSalamis. Now the Eginetans are Dorians from Epidauros, and their\r\nisland had formerly the name of Oinone. After the Eginetans came the\r\nChalkidians with the twenty ships which were at Artemision, and\r\nthe Eretrians with their seven: these are Ionians. Next the Keïans,\r\nfurnishing the same as before and being by race Ionians from Athens. The\r\nNaxians furnished four ships, they having been sent out by the citizens\r\nof their State to join the Persians, like the other islanders; but\r\nneglecting these commands they had come to the Hellenes, urged thereto\r\nby Democritos, a man of repute among the citizens and at that time\r\ncommander of a trireme. Now the Naxians are Ionians coming originally\r\nfrom Athens. The Styrians furnished the same ships as at Artemision, and\r\nthe men of Kythnos one ship and one fifty-oared galley, these both being\r\nDryopians. Also the Seriphians, the Siphnians and the Melians served\r\nwith the rest; for they alone of the islanders had not given earth and\r\nwater to the Barbarian.\r\n\r\n47. These all who have been named dwelt inside the land of the\r\nThesprotians and the river Acheron; for the Thesprotians border upon the\r\nland of the Amprakiots and Leucadians, and these were they who came from\r\nthe greatest distance to serve: but of those who dwell outside these\r\nlimits the men of Croton were the only people who came to the assistance\r\nof Hellas in her danger; and these sent one ship, of whom the commander\r\nwas Phaÿlos, a man who had three times won victories at the Pythian\r\ngames. Now the men of Croton are by descent Achaians.\r\n\r\n48. All the rest who served in the fleet furnished triremes, but the\r\nMelians, Siphnian and Seriphians fifty-oared galleys: the Melians,\r\nwho are by descent from Lacedemon, furnished two, the Siphnians and\r\nSeriphians, who are Ionians from Athens, each one. And the whole number\r\nof the ships, apart from the fifty-oared galleys, was three hundred and\r\nseventy-eight. 31\r\n\r\n49. When the commanders had assembled at Salamis from the States\r\nwhich have been mentioned, they began to deliberate, Eurybiades having\r\nproposed that any one who desired it should declare his opinion as\r\nto where he thought it most convenient to fight a sea-battle in those\r\nregions of which they had command; for Attica had already been let go,\r\nand he was now proposing the question about the other regions. And the\r\nopinions of the speakers for the most part agreed that they should\r\nsail to the Isthmus and there fight a sea-battle in defence of the\r\nPeloponnese, arguing that if they should be defeated in the sea-battle,\r\nsupposing them to be at Salamis they would be blockaded in an island,\r\nwhere no help would come to them, but at the Isthmus they would be able\r\nto land where their own men were.\r\n\r\n50. While the commanders from the Peloponnese argued thus, an Athenian\r\nhad come in reporting that the Barbarians were arrived in Attica and\r\nthat all the land was being laid waste with fire. For the army which\r\ndirected its march through Boeotia in company with Xerxes, after it had\r\nburnt the city of the Thespians (the inhabitants having left it and gone\r\nto the Peloponnese) and that of the Plataians likewise, had now come\r\nto Athens and was laying waste everything in those regions. Now he had\r\nburnt Thespiai 3101 and Plataia because he was informed by the Thebans\r\nthat these were not taking the side of the Medes.\r\n\r\n51. So in three months from the crossing of the Hellespont, whence the\r\nBarbarians began their march, after having stayed there one month while\r\nthey crossed over into Europe, they had reached Attica, in the year when\r\nCalliades was archon of the Athenians. And they took the lower city,\r\nwhich was deserted, and then they found that there were still a few\r\nAthenians left in the temple, either stewards of the temple or needy\r\npersons, who had barred the entrance to the Acropolis with doors and\r\nwith a palisade of timber and endeavoured to defend themselves against\r\nthe attacks of the enemy, being men who had not gone out to Salamis\r\npartly because of their poverty, and also because they thought that\r\nthey alone had discovered the meaning of the oracle which the Pythian\r\nprophetess had uttered to them, namely that the \"bulwark of wood\" should\r\nbe impregnable, and supposed that this was in fact the safe refuge\r\naccording to the oracle, and not the ships.\r\n\r\n52. So the Persians taking their post upon the rising ground opposite\r\nthe Acropolis, which the Athenians call the Hill of Ares, 32 proceeded\r\nto besiege them in this fashion, that is they put tow round about their\r\narrows and lighted it, and then shot them against the palisade. The\r\nAthenians who were besieged continued to defend themselves nevertheless,\r\nalthough they had come to the extremity of distress and their palisade\r\nhad played them false; nor would they accept proposals for surrender,\r\nwhen the sons of Peisistratos brought them forward: but endeavouring to\r\ndefend themselves they contrived several contrivances against the enemy,\r\nand among the rest they rolled down large stones when the Barbarians\r\napproached the gates; so that for a long time Xerxes was in a\r\ndifficulty, not being able to capture them.\r\n\r\n53. In time however there appeared for the Barbarians a way of approach\r\nafter their difficulties, since by the oracle it was destined that all\r\nof Attica which is on the mainland should come to be under the Persians.\r\nThus then it happened that on the front side 33 of the Acropolis behind\r\nthe gates and the way up to the entrance, in a place where no one was\r\nkeeping guard, nor would one have supposed that any man could ascend by\r\nthis way, here men ascended by the temple of Aglauros the daughter\r\nof Kecrops, although indeed the place is precipitous: and when the\r\nAthenians saw that they had ascended up to the Acropolis, some of them\r\nthrew themselves down from the wall and perished, while others took\r\nrefuge in the sanctuary 34 of the temple. Then those of the Persians\r\nwho had ascended went first to the gates, and after opening these they\r\nproceeded to kill the suppliants; and when all had been slain by them,\r\nthey plundered the temple and set fire to the whole of the Acropolis.\r\n\r\n54. Then Xerxes, having fully taken possession of Athens, sent to Susa\r\na mounted messenger to report to Artabanos the good success which they\r\nhad. And on the next day after sending the herald he called together the\r\nexiles of the Athenians who were accompanying him, and bade them go\r\nup to the Acropolis and sacrifice the victims after their own manner;\r\nwhether it was that he had seen some vision of a dream which caused him\r\nto give this command, or whether perchance he had a scruple in his\r\nmind because he had set fire to the temple. The Athenian exiles did\r\naccordingly that which was commanded them:\r\n\r\n55, and the reason why I made mention of this I will here declare:—there\r\nis in this Acropolis a temple 35 of Erechtheus, who is said to have been\r\nborn of the Earth, and in this there is an olive-tree and a sea, which\r\n(according to the story told by the Athenians) Poseidon and Athene,\r\nwhen they contended for the land, set as witnesses of themselves. Now\r\nit happened to this olive-tree to be set on fire with the rest of the\r\ntemple by the Barbarians; and on the next day after the conflagration\r\nthose of the Athenians who were commanded by the king to offer\r\nsacrifice, saw when they had gone up to the temple that a shoot had run\r\nup from the stock of the tree about a cubit in length. These then made\r\nreport of this.\r\n\r\n56. The Hellenes meanwhile at Salamis, when it was announced to them how\r\nit had been as regards the Acropolis of the Athenians, were disturbed so\r\ngreatly that some of the commanders did not even wait for the question\r\nto be decided which had been proposed, but began to go hastily to their\r\nships and to put up their sails, meaning to make off with speed; and by\r\nthose of them who remained behind it was finally decided to fight at\r\nsea in defence of the Isthmus. So night came on, and they having been\r\ndismissed from the council were going to their ships:\r\n\r\n57, and when Themistocles had come to his ship, Mnesiphilos an Athenian\r\nasked him what they had resolved; and being informed by him that it had\r\nbeen determined to take out the ships to the Isthmus and fight a battle\r\nby sea in defence of the Peloponnese, he said: \"Then, if they set sail\r\nwith the ships from Salamis, thou wilt not fight any more sea-battles\r\nat all for the fatherland, for they will all take their way to their\r\nseveral cities and neither Eurybiades nor any other man will be able\r\nto detain them or to prevent the fleet from being dispersed: and Hellas\r\nwill perish by reason of evil counsels. But if there by any means, go\r\nthou and try to unsettle that which has been resolved, if perchance thou\r\nmayest persuade Eurybiades to change his plans, so as to stay here.\"\r\n\r\n58. This advice very much commended itself to Themistocles; and without\r\nmaking any answer he went to the ship of Eurybiades. Having come thither\r\nhe said that he desired to communicate to him a matter which concerned\r\nthe common good; and Eurybiades bade him come into his ship and speak,\r\nif he desired to say anything. Then Themistocles sitting down beside\r\nhim repeated to him all those things which he had heard Mnesiphilos say,\r\nmaking as if they were his own thoughts, and adding to them many others;\r\nuntil at last by urgent request he persuaded him to come out of his ship\r\nand gather the commanders to the council.\r\n\r\n59. So when they were gathered together, before Eurybiades proposed\r\nthe discussion of the things for which he had assembled the commanders,\r\nThemistocles spoke with much vehemence 36 being very eager to gain his\r\nend; and as he was speaking, the Corinthian commander, Adeimantos the\r\nson of Okytos, said: \"Themistocles, at the games those who stand forth\r\nfor the contest before the due time are beaten with rods.\" He justifying\r\nhimself said: \"Yes, but those who remain behind are not crowned.\"\r\n\r\n60. At that time he made answer mildly to the Corinthian; and to\r\nEurybiades he said not now any of those things which he had said before,\r\nto the effect that if they should set sail from Salamis they would\r\ndisperse in different directions; for it was not seemly for him to bring\r\ncharges against the allies in their presence: but he held to another way\r\nof reasoning, saying: \"Now it is in thy power to save Hellas, if\r\nthou wilt follow my advice, which is to stay here and here to fight a\r\nsea-battle, and if thou wilt not follow the advice of those among these\r\nmen who bid thee remove the ships to the Isthmus. For hear both ways,\r\nand then set them in comparison. If thou engage battle at the Isthmus,\r\nthou wilt fight in an open sea, into which it is by no means convenient\r\nfor us that we go to fight, seeing that we have ships which are heavier\r\nand fewer in number than those of the enemy. Then secondly thou wilt\r\ngive up to destruction Salamis and Megara and Egina, even if we have\r\nsuccess in all else; for with their fleet will come also the land-army,\r\nand thus thou wilt thyself lead them to the Peloponnese and wilt risk\r\nthe safety of all Hellas. If however thou shalt do as I say, thou wilt\r\nfind therein all the advantages which I shall tell thee of:—in the first\r\nplace by engaging in a narrow place with few ships against many, if the\r\nfighting has that issue which it is reasonable to expect, we shall have\r\nvery much the better; for to fight a sea-fight in a narrow space is for\r\nour advantage, but to fight in a wide open space is for theirs. Then\r\nagain Salamis will be preserved, whither our children and our wives\r\nhave been removed for safety; and moreover there is this also secured\r\nthereby, to which ye are most of all attached, namely that by remaining\r\nhere thou wilt fight in defence of the Peloponnese as much as if\r\nthe fight were at the Isthmus; and thou wilt not lead the enemy to\r\nPeloponnese, if thou art wise. Then if that which I expect come to pass\r\nand we gain a victory with our ships, the Barbarians will not come to\r\nyou at the Isthmus nor will they advance further than Attica, but they\r\nwill retire in disorder; and we shall be the gainers by the preservation\r\nof Megara and Egina and Salamis, at which place too an oracle tells us\r\nthat we shall get the victory over our enemies. 37 Now when men take\r\ncounsel reasonably for themselves, reasonable issues are wont as a rule\r\nto come, but if they do not take counsel reasonably, then God is not\r\nwont generally to attach himself to the judgment of men.\"\r\n\r\n61. When Themistocles thus spoke, the Corinthian Adeimantos inveighed\r\nagainst him for the second time, bidding him to be silent because he\r\nhad no native land, and urging Eurybiades not to put to the vote\r\nthe proposal of one who was a citizen of no city; for he said that\r\nThemistocles might bring opinions before the council if he could show a\r\ncity belonging to him, but otherwise not. This objection he made against\r\nhim because Athens had been taken and was held by the enemy. Then\r\nThemistocles said many evil things of him and of the Corinthians both,\r\nand declared also that he himself and his countrymen had in truth a city\r\nand a land larger than that of the Corinthians, so long as they had two\r\nhundred ships fully manned; for none of the Hellenes would be able to\r\nrepel the Athenians if they came to fight against them.\r\n\r\n62. Signifying this he turned then to Eurybiades and spoke yet more\r\nurgently: \"If thou wilt remain here, and remaining here wilt show\r\nthyself a good man, well; but if not, thou wilt bring about the\r\noverthrow of Hellas, for upon the ships depends all our power in the\r\nwar. Nay, but do as I advise. If, however, thou shalt not do so, we\r\nshall forthwith take up our households and voyage to Siris in Italy,\r\nwhich is ours already of old and the oracles say that it is destined\r\nto be colonised by us; and ye, when ye are left alone and deprived of\r\nallies such as we are, will remember my words.\"\r\n\r\n63. When Themistocles thus spoke, Eurybiades was persuaded to change his\r\nmind; and, as I think, he changed his mind chiefly from fear lest the\r\nAthenians should depart and leave them, if he should take the ships to\r\nthe Isthmus; for if the Athenians left them and departed, the rest would\r\nbe no longer able to fight with the enemy. He chose then this counsel,\r\nto stay in that place and decide matters there by a sea-fight.\r\n\r\n64. Thus those at Salamis, after having skirmished with one another in\r\nspeech, were making preparations for a sea-fight there, since Eurybiades\r\nhad so determined: and as day was coming on, at the same time when the\r\nsun rose there was an earthquake felt both on the land and on the sea:\r\nand they determined to pray to the gods and to call upon the sons of\r\nAiacos to be their helpers. And as they had determined, so also they\r\ndid; for when they had prayed to all the gods, they called Ajax and\r\nTelamon to their help from Salamis, where the fleet was, 38 and sent\r\na ship to Egina to bring Aiacos himself and the rest of the sons of\r\nAiacos.\r\n\r\n65. Moreover Dicaios the son of Theokydes, an Athenian, who was an exile\r\nand had become of great repute among the Medes at this time, declared\r\nthat when the Attic land was being ravaged by the land-army of Xerxes,\r\nhaving been deserted by the Athenians, he happened then to be in company\r\nwith Demaratos the Lacedemonian in the Thriasian plain; and he saw a\r\ncloud of dust going up from Eleusis, as if made by a company of about\r\nthirty thousand men, and they wondered at the cloud of dust, by what men\r\nit was caused. Then forthwith they heard a sound of voices, and Dicaios\r\nperceived that the sound was the mystic cry Iacchos; but Demaratos,\r\nhaving no knowledge of the sacred rites which are done at Eleusis, asked\r\nhim what this was that uttered the sound, and he said: \"Demaratos, it\r\ncannot be but that some great destruction is about to come to the army\r\nof the king: for as to this, it is very manifest, seeing that Attica is\r\ndeserted, that this which utters the sound is of the gods, and that it\r\nis going from Eleusis to help the Athenians and their allies: if then it\r\nshall come down in the Peloponnese, there is danger for the king himself\r\nand for the army which is upon the mainland, but if it shall direct\r\nits course towards the ships which are at Salamis, the king will be in\r\ndanger of losing his fleet. This feast the Athenians celebrate every\r\nyear to the Mother and the Daughter; 39 and he that desires it, both of\r\nthem and of the other Hellenes, is initiated in the mysteries; and the\r\nsound of voices which thou hearest is the cry Iacchos which they utter\r\nat this feast.\" To this Demaratos said: \"Keep silence and tell not this\r\ntale to any other man; for if these words of thine be reported to the\r\nking, thou wilt surely lose thy head, and neither I nor any other man\r\nupon earth will be able to save thee: but keep thou quiet, and about\r\nthis expedition the gods will provide.\" He then thus advised, and after\r\nthe cloud of dust and the sound of voices there came a mist which was\r\nborne aloft and carried towards Salamis to the camp of the Hellenes: and\r\nthus they learnt (said he) that the fleet of Xerxes was destined to be\r\ndestroyed. Such was the report made by Dicaios the son of Theodykes,\r\nappealing to Demaratos and others also as witnesses.\r\n\r\n66. Meanwhile those who were appointed to serve in the fleet of Xerxes,\r\nhaving gazed in Trachis upon the disaster of the Lacedemonians and\r\nhaving passed over from thence to Histiaia, after staying three days\r\nsailed through Euripos, and in other three days they had reached\r\nPhaleron. And, as I suppose, they made their attack upon Athens not\r\nfewer in number both by land and sea than when they had arrived at\r\nSepias and at Thermopylai: for against those of them who perished by\r\nreason of the storm and those who were slain at Thermopylai and in the\r\nsea-fights at Artemision, I will set those who at that time were not\r\nyet accompanying the king, the Malians, Dorians, Locrians, and Boeotians\r\n(who accompanied him in a body, except the Thespians and Plataians),\r\nand moreover those of Carystos, Andros, and Tenos, with all the other\r\nislanders except the five cities of which I mentioned the names before;\r\nfor the more the Persian advanced towards the centre of Hellas, the more\r\nnations accompanied him.\r\n\r\n67. So then, when all these had come to Athens except the Parians (now\r\nthe Parians had remained behind at Kythnos waiting to see how the war\r\nwould turn out),—when all the rest, I say, had come to Phaleron, then\r\nXerxes himself came down to the ships desiring to visit them and to\r\nlearn the opinions of those who sailed in them: and when he had come and\r\nwas set in a conspicuous place, then those who were despots of their own\r\nnations or commanders of divisions being sent for came before him from\r\ntheir ships, and took their seats as the king had assigned rank to each\r\none, first the king of Sidon, then he of Tyre, and after them the\r\nrest: and when they were seated in due order, Xerxes sent Mardonios and\r\ninquired, making trial of each one, whether he should fight a battle by\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n68. So when Mardonios went round asking them, beginning with the king of\r\nSidon, the others gave their opinions all to the same effect, advising\r\nhim to fight a battle by sea, but Artemisia spoke these words:—(a) \"Tell\r\nthe king I pray thee, Mardonios, that I, who have proved myself not to\r\nbe the worst in the sea-fights which have been fought near Euboea, and\r\nhave displayed deeds not inferior to those of others, speak to him thus:\r\nMaster, it is right that I set forth the opinion which I really have,\r\nand say that which I happen to think best for thy cause: and this I\r\nsay,—spare thy ships and do not make a sea-fight; for the men are as\r\nmuch stronger than thy men by sea, as men are stronger than women. And\r\nwhy must thou needs run the risk of sea-battles? Hast thou not Athens in\r\nthy possession, for the sake of which thou didst set forth on thy march,\r\nand also the rest of Hellas? and no man stands in thy way to resist, but\r\nthose who did stand against thee came off as it was fitting that\r\nthey should. (b) Now the manner in which I think the affairs of thy\r\nadversaries will have their issue, I will declare. If thou do not\r\nhasten to make a sea-fight, but keep thy ships here by the land, either\r\nremaining here thyself or even advancing on to the Peloponnese, that\r\nwhich thou hast come to do, O master, will easily be effected; for the\r\nHellenes are not able to hold out against thee for any long time, but\r\nthou wilt soon disperse them and they will take flight to their several\r\ncities: since neither have they provisions with them in this island, as\r\nI am informed, nor is it probable that if thou shalt march thy land-army\r\nagainst the Peloponnese, they who have come from thence will remain\r\nstill; for these will have no care to fight a battle in defence of\r\nAthens. (c) If however thou hasten to fight forthwith, I fear that\r\ndamage done to the fleet may ruin the land-army also. Moreover, O king,\r\nconsider also this, that the servants of good men are apt to grow bad,\r\nbut those of bad men good; and thou, who art of all men the best, hast\r\nbad servants, namely those who are reckoned as allies, Egyptians and\r\nCyprians and Kilikians and Pamphylians, in whom there is no profit.\"\r\n\r\n69. When she thus spoke to Mardonios, those who were friendly to\r\nArtemisia were grieved at her words, supposing that she would suffer\r\nsome evil from the king because she urged him not to fight at sea; while\r\nthose who had envy and jealousy of her, because she had been honoured\r\nabove all the allies, were rejoiced at the opposition, 40 supposing\r\nthat she would now be ruined. When however the opinions were reported\r\nto Xerxes, he was greatly pleased with the opinion of Artemisia; and\r\nwhereas even before this he thought her excellent, he commended her\r\nnow yet more. Nevertheless he gave orders to follow the advice of the\r\ngreater number, thinking that when they fought by Euboea they were\r\npurposely slack, because he was not himself present with them, whereas\r\nnow he had made himself ready to look on while they fought a sea-battle.\r\n\r\n70. So when they passed the word to put out to sea, they brought their\r\nships out to Salamis and quietly ranged themselves along the shore in\r\ntheir several positions. At that time the daylight was not sufficient\r\nfor them to engage battle, for night had come on; but they made their\r\npreparations to fight on the following day. Meanwhile the Hellenes\r\nwere possessed by fear and dismay, especially those who were from\r\nPeloponnese: and these were dismayed because remaining in Salamis they\r\nwere to fight a battle on behalf of the land of the Athenians, and being\r\ndefeated they would be cut off from escape and blockaded in an island,\r\nleaving their own land unguarded. And indeed the land-army of the\r\nBarbarians was marching forward during that very night towards the\r\nPeloponnese.\r\n\r\n71. Yet every means had been taken that the Barbarians might not be able\r\nto enter Peloponnesus by land: for as soon as the Peloponnesians heard\r\nthat Leonidas and his company had perished at Thermopylai, they came\r\ntogether quickly from the cities and took post at the Isthmus, and\r\nover them was set as commander Cleombrotos, the son of Anaxandrides and\r\nbrother of Leonidas. These being posted at the Isthmus had destroyed the\r\nSkironian way, and after this (having so determined in counsel with one\r\nanother) they began to build a wall across the Isthmus; and as they were\r\nmany myriads 41 and every man joined in the work, the work proceeded\r\nfast; for stones and bricks and pieces of timber and baskets full of\r\nsand were carried to it continually, and they who had thus come to help\r\npaused not at all in their work either by night or by day.\r\n\r\n72. Now those of the Hellenes who came in full force to the Isthmus to\r\nhelp their country were these,—the Lacedemonians, the Arcadians of every\r\ndivision, the Eleians, Corinthians, Sikyonians, Epidaurians, Phliasians,\r\nTroizenians and Hermionians. These were they who came to the help of\r\nHellas in her danger and who had apprehension for her, while the rest\r\nof the Peloponnesians showed no care: and the Olympic and Carneian\r\nfestivals had by this time gone by.\r\n\r\n73. Now Peloponnesus is inhabited by seven races; and of these, two are\r\nnatives of the soil and are settled now in the place where they dwelt of\r\nold, namely the Arcadians and the Kynurians; and one race, that of the\r\nAchaians, though it did not remove from the Peloponnese, yet removed in\r\nformer time from its own land and dwells now in that which was not its\r\nown. The remaining races, four in number, have come in from without,\r\nnamely the Dorians, Aitolians, Dryopians and Lemnians. Of the Dorians\r\nthere are many cities and of great renown; of the Aitolians, Elis\r\nalone; of the Dryopians, Hermion 42 and Asine, which latter is opposite\r\nCardamyle in the Laconian land; and of the Lemnians, all the Paroreatai.\r\nThe Kynurians, who are natives of the soil, seem alone to be Ionians,\r\nbut they have become Dorians completely because they are subject to the\r\nArgives and by lapse of time, being originally citizens of Orneai or\r\nthe dwellers in the country round Orneai. 43 Of these seven nations the\r\nremaining cities, except those which I enumerated just now, stood aside\r\nand did nothing; and if one may be allowed to speak freely, in thus\r\nstanding aside they were in fact taking the side of the Medes.\r\n\r\n74. Those at the Isthmus were struggling with the labour which I have\r\nsaid, since now they were running a course in which their very being was\r\nat stake, and they did not look to have any brilliant success with their\r\nships: while those who were at Salamis, though informed of this\r\nwork, were yet dismayed, not fearing so much for themselves as for\r\nPeloponnesus. For some time then they spoke of it in private, one\r\nman standing by another, and they marvelled at the ill-counsel of\r\nEurybiades; but at last it broke out publicly. A meeting accordingly was\r\nheld, and much was spoken about the same points as before, some saying\r\nthat they ought to sail away to Peloponnesus and run the risk in defence\r\nof that, and not stay and fight for a land which had been captured by\r\nthe enemy, while the Athenians, Eginetans and Megarians urged that they\r\nshould stay there and defend themselves.\r\n\r\n75. Then Themistocles, when his opinion was like to be defeated by the\r\nPeloponnesians, secretly went forth from the assembly, and having gone\r\nout he sent a man to the encampment of the Medes in a boat, charging him\r\nwith that which he must say: this man's name was Sikinnos, and he was\r\na servant of Themistocles and tutor to his children; and after these\r\nevents Themistocles entered him as a Thespian citizen, when the\r\nThespians were admitting new citizens, and made him a wealthy man. He at\r\nthis time came with a boat and said to the commanders of the Barbarians\r\nthese words: \"The commander of the Athenians sent me privately without\r\nthe knowledge of the other Hellenes (for, as it chances, he is disposed\r\nto the cause of the king, and desires rather that your side should gain\r\nthe victory than that of the Hellenes), to inform you that the Hellenes\r\nare planning to take flight, having been struck with dismay; and now it\r\nis possible for you to execute a most noble work, if ye do not permit\r\nthem to flee away: for they are not of one mind with one another and\r\nthey will not stand against you in fight, but ye shall see them fighting\r\na battle by sea with one another, those who are disposed to your side\r\nagainst those who are not.\"\r\n\r\n76. He then having signified to them this, departed out of the way; and\r\nthey, thinking that the message deserved credit, landed first a large\r\nnumber of Persians in the small island of Psyttaleia, which lies between\r\nSalamis and the mainland; and then, as midnight came on, they put out\r\nthe Western wing of their fleet to sea, circling round towards Salamis,\r\nand also those stationed about Keos and Kynosura put out their ships\r\nto sea; and they occupied all the passage with their ships as far as\r\nMunychia. And for this reason they put out their ships, namely in order\r\nthat the Hellenes might not even be permitted to get away, but being cut\r\noff in Salamis might pay the penalty for the contests at Artemision:\r\nand they disembarked men of the Persians on the small island called\r\nPsyttaleia for this reason, namely that when the fight should take\r\nplace, these might save the men of one side and destroy those of the\r\nother, since there especially it was likely that the men and the wrecks\r\nof ships would be cast up on shore, for the island lay in the way of the\r\nsea-fight which was to be. These things they did in silence, that the\r\nenemy might not have information of them.\r\n\r\n77. They then were making their preparations thus in the night without\r\nhaving taken any sleep at all: and with regard to oracles, I am not able\r\nto make objections against them that they are not true, for I do not\r\ndesire to attempt to overthrow the credit of them when they speak\r\nclearly, looking at such matters as these which here follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"But when with ships they shall join the sacred strand of the goddess,\r\n  Artemis golden-sword-girded, and thee, wave-washed Kynosura,\r\n  Urged by a maddening hope, 44 having given rich Athens to plunder,\r\n  Then shall Justice divine quell Riot, of Insolence first-born, 45\r\n  Longing to overthrow all things 46 and terribly panting for bloodhshed:\r\n  Brass shall encounter with brass, and Ares the sea shall empurple,\r\n  Tinging its waves with the blood: then a day of freedom for Hellas\r\n  Cometh from wide-seeing Zeus 47 and from Victory, lady and mother.\" 48\r\n\r\nLooking to such things as this, and when Bakis speaks so clearly, I do\r\nnot venture myself to make any objections about oracles, nor can I admit\r\nthem from others.\r\n\r\n78. Now between the commanders that were at Salamis there came to be\r\ngreat contention of speech and they did not yet know that the Barbarians\r\nwere surrounding them with their ships, but they thought that they were\r\nstill in their place as they saw them disposed in the day.\r\n\r\n79. Then while the commanders were engaged in strife, there came over\r\nfrom Egina Aristeides the son of Lysimachos, an Athenian who had been\r\nostracised by the people, a man whom I hold (according to that which\r\nI hear of his character) to have been the best and most upright of all\r\nAthenians. This man came into the council and called forth Themistocles,\r\nwho was to him not a friend, but an enemy to the last degree; but\r\nbecause of the greatness of the present troubles he let those matters be\r\nforgotten and called him forth, desiring to communicate with him. Now he\r\nhad heard beforehand that the Peloponnesians were pressing to take\r\nthe ships away to the Isthmus. So when Themistocles came forth to him,\r\nAristeides spoke these words: \"Both at other times when occasion arises,\r\nand also especially at this time we ought to carry on rivalry as to\r\nwhich of us shall do more service to our country. And I tell thee now\r\nthat it is indifferent whether the Peloponnesians say many words or few\r\nabout sailing away from hence; for having been myself an eye-witness I\r\ntell thee that now not even if the Corinthians and Eurybiades himself\r\ndesire to sail out, will they be able; for we are encompassed round by\r\nthe enemy. Go thou in then, and signify this to them.\"\r\n\r\n80. He made answer as follows: \"Thou advisest very well, 49 and also\r\nthe news which thou hast brought is good, since thou art come having\r\nwitnessed with thine own eyes that which I desired might come to pass:\r\nfor know that this which is being done by the Medes is of my suggestion;\r\nbecause, when the Hellenes would not come to a battle of their own will,\r\nit was necessary to bring them over to us against their will. Do thou\r\nhowever, since thou art come bearing good news, thyself report it to\r\nthem; for if I say these things, I shall be thought to speak that which\r\nI have myself invented, and I shall not persuade them, but they will\r\nthink that the Barbarians are not doing so. Do thou thyself however come\r\nforward to speak, and declare to them how things are; and when thou hast\r\ndeclared this, if they are persuaded, that will be the best thing, but\r\nif this is not credible to them, it will be the same thing so far as\r\nconcerns us, for they will no longer be able to take to flight, if we\r\nare encompassed on all sides, as thou sayest.\"\r\n\r\n81. Aristeides accordingly came forward and told them this, saying that\r\nhe had come from Egina and had with difficulty escaped without being\r\nperceived by those who were blockading them; for the whole encampment of\r\nthe Hellenes was encompassed by the ships of Xerxes; and he counselled\r\nthem to get ready to defend themselves. He then having thus spoken\r\nretired, and among them again there arose dispute, for the greater\r\nnumber of the commanders did not believe that which was reported to\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n82. and while these were doubting, there came a trireme manned by\r\nTenians, deserting from the enemy, of which the commander was Panaitios\r\nthe son of Sosimenes, which brought them the whole truth. For this deed\r\nthe Tenians were inscribed at Delphi on the tripod among those who had\r\nconquered the Barbarians. With the ship which deserted at Salamis and\r\nthe Lemnian ship which deserted before and came to Artemision, the naval\r\nforce of the Hellenes was completed to the number of three hundred and\r\neighty ships, for before this two ships were yet wanting to make up this\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n83. The Hellenes then, since they believed that which was said by the\r\nTenians, were preparing for a sea-fight: and as the dawn appeared, they\r\nmade an assembly of those who fought on board the ships 50 and addressed\r\nthem, Themistocles making a speech which was eloquent beyond the rest;\r\nand the substance of it was to set forth all that is better as opposed\r\nto that which is worse, of the several things which arise in the nature\r\nand constitution of man; and having exhorted them to choose the better,\r\n51 and thus having wound up his speech, he bade them embark in their\r\nships. These then proceeded to embark, and there came in meanwhile the\r\ntrireme from Egina which had gone away to bring the sons of Aiacos.\r\n\r\n84. Then the Hellenes put out all their ships, and while they were\r\nputting out from shore, the Barbarians attacked them forthwith. Now\r\nthe other Hellenes began backing their ships and were about to run them\r\naground, but Ameinias of Pallene, an Athenian, put forth with his ship\r\nand charged one of the enemy; and his ship being entangled in combat and\r\nthe men not being able to get away, the others joined in the fight to\r\nassist Ameinias. The Athenians say that the beginning of the battle was\r\nmade thus, but the Eginetans say that the ship which went away to Egina\r\nto bring the sons of Aiacos was that which began the fight. It is also\r\nreported that an apparition of a woman was seen by them, and that having\r\nappeared she encouraged them to the fight so that the whole of the army\r\nof the Hellenes heard it, first having reproached them in these words:\r\n\"Madmen, 52 how far will ye yet back your ships?\"\r\n\r\n85. Opposite the Athenians had been ranged the Phenicians, for these\r\noccupied the wing towards Eleusis and the West, and opposite the\r\nLacedemonians were the Ionians, who occupied the wing which extended to\r\nthe East and to Piræus. Of them however a few were purposely slack\r\nin the fight according to the injunctions of Themistocles, 53 but\r\nthe greater number were not so. I might mention now the names of many\r\ncaptains of ships who destroyed ships of the Hellenes, but I will make\r\nno use of their names except in the case of Theomestor, the son of\r\nAndrodamas and Phylacos the son of Histiaios, of Samos both: and\r\nfor this reason I make mention of these and not of the rest, because\r\nTheomestor on account of this deed became despot of Samos, appointed by\r\nthe Persians, and Phylacos was recorded as a benefactor of the king\r\nand received much land as a reward. Now the benefactors of the king are\r\ncalled in the Persian tongue orosangai.\r\n\r\n86. Thus it was with these; but the greater number of their ships were\r\ndisabled at Salamis, being destroyed some by the Athenians and others\r\nby the Eginetans: for since the Hellenes fought in order and ranged in\r\ntheir places, while the Barbarians were no longer ranged in order nor\r\ndid anything with design, it was likely that there would be some such\r\nresult as in fact followed. Yet on this day they surpassed themselves\r\nmuch more than when they fought by Euboea, every one being eager\r\nand fearing Xerxes, and each man thinking that the king was looking\r\nespecially at him.\r\n\r\n87. As regards the rest I cannot speak of them separately, or say\r\nprecisely how the Barbarians or the Hellenes individually contended in\r\nthe fight; but with regard to Artemisia that which happened was this,\r\nwhence she gained yet more esteem than before from the king.—When the\r\naffairs of the king had come to great confusion, at this crisis a ship\r\nof Artemisia was being pursued by an Athenian ship; and as she was not\r\nable to escape, for in front of her were other ships of her own side,\r\nwhile her ship, as it chanced, was furthest advanced towards the enemy,\r\nshe resolved what she would do, and it proved also much to her advantage\r\nto have done so. While she was being pursued by the Athenian ship\r\nshe charged with full career against a ship of her own side manned by\r\nCalyndians and in which the king of the Calyndians Damasithymos was\r\nembarked. Now, even though it be true that she had had some strife with\r\nhim before, while they were still about the Hellespont, yet I am not\r\nable to say whether she did this by intention, or whether the Calyndian\r\nship happened by chance to fall in her way. Having charged against it\r\nhowever and sunk it, she enjoyed good fortune and got for herself good\r\nin two ways; for first the captain of the Athenian ship, when he saw her\r\ncharge against a ship manned by Barbarians, turned away and went after\r\nothers, supposing that the ship of Artemisia was either a Hellenic ship\r\nor was deserting from the Barbarians and fighting for the Hellenes,\r\n\r\n88,—first, I say, it was her fortune to have this, namely to escape and\r\nnot suffer destruction; and then secondly it happened that though she\r\nhad done mischief, she yet gained great reputation by this thing with\r\nXerxes. For it is said that the king looking on at the fight perceived\r\nthat her ship had charged the other; and one of those present said:\r\n\"Master, dost thou see Artemisia, how well she is fighting, and how she\r\nsank even now a ship of the enemy?\" He asked whether this was in truth\r\nthe deed of Artemisia, and they said that it was; for (they declared)\r\nthey knew very well the sign of her ship: and that which was destroyed\r\nthey thought surely was one of the enemy; for besides other things\r\nwhich happened fortunately for her, as I have said, there was this also,\r\nnamely that not one of the crew of the Calyndian ship survived to become\r\nher accuser. And Xerxes in answer to that which was said to him is\r\nreported to have uttered these words: \"My men have become women, and my\r\nwomen men.\" Thus it is said that Xerxes spoke.\r\n\r\n89. And meanwhile in this struggle there was slain the commander\r\nAriabignes, son of Dareios and brother of Xerxes, and there were slain\r\ntoo many others of note of the Persians and Medes and also of the\r\nallies; and of the Hellenes on their part a few; for since they knew\r\nhow to swim, those whose ships were destroyed and who were not slain in\r\nhand-to-hand conflict swam over to Salamis; but of the Barbarians the\r\ngreater number perished in the sea, not being able to swim. And when\r\nthe first ships turned to flight, then it was that the largest number\r\nperished, for those who were stationed behind, while endeavouring to\r\npass with their ships to the front in order that they also might display\r\nsome deed of valour for the king to see, ran into the ships of their own\r\nside as they fled.\r\n\r\n90. It happened also in the course of this confusion that some of the\r\nPhenicians, whose ships had been destroyed, came to the king and accused\r\nthe Ionians, saying that by means of them their ships had been lost, and\r\nthat they had been traitors to the cause. Now it so came about that not\r\nonly the commanders of the Ionians did not lose their lives, but the\r\nPhenicians who accused them received a reward such as I shall tell.\r\nWhile these men were yet speaking thus, a Samothrakian ship charged\r\nagainst an Athenian ship: and as the Athenian ship was being sunk by\r\nit, an Eginetan ship came up against the Samothrakian vessel and ran it\r\ndown. Then the Samothrakians, being skilful javelin-throwers, by hurling\r\ncleared off the fighting-men from the ship which had wrecked theirs and\r\nthen embarked upon it and took possession of it. This event saved the\r\nIonians from punishment; for when Xerxes saw that they had performed a\r\ngreat exploit, he turned to the Phenicians (for he was exceedingly vexed\r\nand disposed to find fault with all) and bade cut off their heads, in\r\norder that they might not, after having been cowards themselves, accuse\r\nothers who were better men than they. For whensoever Xerxes (sitting\r\njust under the mountain opposite Salamis, which is called Aigaleos) saw\r\nany one of his own side display a deed of valour in the sea-fight, he\r\ninquired about him who had done it, and the scribes recorded the name of\r\nthe ship's captain with that of his father and the city from whence he\r\ncame. Moreover also Ariaramnes, a Persian who was present, shared 54 the\r\nfate of the Phenicians, being their friend. They 55 then proceeded to\r\ndeal with the Phenicians.\r\n\r\n91. In the meantime, as the Barbarians turned to flight and were sailing\r\nout towards Phaleron, the Eginetans waited for them in the passage and\r\ndisplayed memorable actions: for while the Athenians in the confused\r\ntumult were disabling both those ships which resisted and those which\r\nwere fleeing, the Eginetans were destroying those which attempted to\r\nsail away; and whenever any escaped the Athenians, they went in full\r\ncourse and fell among the Eginetans.\r\n\r\n92. Then there met one another the ship of Themistocles, which was\r\npursuing a ship of the enemy, and that of Polycritos the son of Crios\r\nthe Eginetan. This last had charged against a ship of Sidon, the same\r\nthat had taken the Eginetan vessel which was keeping watch in advance at\r\nSkiathos, 56 and in which sailed Pytheas the son of Ischenoös, whom\r\nthe Persians kept in their ship, all cut to pieces as he was, making a\r\nmarvel of his valour. The Sidonian ship then was captured bearing with\r\nit this man as well as the Persians of whom I spoke, so that Pytheas\r\nthus came safe to Egina. Now when Polycritos looked at the Athenian\r\nvessel he recognised when he saw it the sign of the admiral's ship, and\r\nshouting out he addressed Themistocles with mockery about the accusation\r\nbrought against the Eginetans of taking the side of the Medes, 57 and\r\nreproached him. This taunt Polycritos threw out against Themistocles\r\nafter he had charged against the ship of Sidon. And meanwhile those\r\nBarbarians whose ships had escaped destruction fled and came to Phaleron\r\nto be under cover of the land-army.\r\n\r\n93. In this sea-fight the Eginetans were of all the Hellenes the best\r\nreported of, and next to them the Athenians; and of the individual\r\nmen the Eginetan Polycritos and the Athenians Eumenes of Anagyrus and\r\nAmeinias of Pallene, the man who had pursued after Artemisia. Now if\r\nhe had known that Artemisia was sailing in this ship, he would not have\r\nceased until either he had taken her or had been taken himself; for\r\norders had been given to the Athenian captains, and moreover a prize was\r\noffered of ten thousand drachmas for the man who should take her alive;\r\nsince they thought it intolerable that a woman should make an expedition\r\nagainst Athens. She then, as has been said before, had made her escape;\r\nand the others also, whose ships had escaped destruction, were at\r\nPhaleron.\r\n\r\n94. As regards Adeimantos the commander of the Corinthians, the\r\nAthenians say that forthwith at the beginning when the ships were\r\nengaging in the fight, being struck with panic and terror he put up his\r\nsails and fled away; and the Corinthians, when they saw the admiral's\r\nship fleeing, departed likewise: and after this, as the story goes, when\r\nthey came in their flight opposite to the temple of Athene Skiras in\r\nthe land of Salamis, there fell in with them by divine guidance a\r\nlight vessel, 58 which no one was ever found to have sent, and which\r\napproached the Corinthians at a time when they knew nothing of that\r\nwhich was happening with the fleet. And by this it is conjectured 59\r\nthat the matter was of the Deity; for when they came near to the ships,\r\nthe men in the light vessel said these words: \"Adeimantos, thou hast\r\nturned thy ships away and hast set forth to flee, deserting the cause of\r\nthe Hellenes, while they are in truth gaining a victory and getting\r\nthe better of their foes as much as they desired.\" When they said this,\r\nsince Adeimantos doubted of it, they spoke a second time and said that\r\nthey might be taken as hostages and slain, if the Hellenes should prove\r\nnot to be gaining the victory. Then he turned his ship back, he and the\r\nothers with him, and they reached the camp when the work was finished.\r\nSuch is the report spread by the Athenians against these: the\r\nCorinthians however do not allow this to be so, but hold that they were\r\namong the first in the sea-fight; and the rest of Hellas also bears\r\nwitness on their side.\r\n\r\n95. Aristeides moreover the son of Lysimachos, the Athenian, of whom\r\nI made mention also shortly before this as a very good man, he in this\r\ntumult which had arisen about Salamis did as follows:—taking with him\r\na number of the hoplites of Athenian race who had been ranged along the\r\nshore of the land of Salamis, with them he disembarked on the island of\r\nPsyttaleia; and these slew all the Persians who were in this islet.\r\n\r\n96. When the sea-fight had been broken off, the Hellenes towed in to\r\nSalamis so many of the wrecks as chanced to be still about there, and\r\nheld themselves ready for another sea-fight, expecting that the king\r\nwould yet make use of the ships which remained unhurt; but many of the\r\nwrecks were taken by the West Wind and borne to that strand in Attica\r\nwhich is called Colias; so as to fulfil 60 not only all that other\r\noracle which was spoken about this sea-fight by Bakis and Musaios, but\r\nalso especially, with reference to the wrecks cast up here, that\r\nwhich had been spoken in an oracle many years before these events by\r\nLysistratos, an Athenian who uttered oracles, and which had not been\r\nobserved by any of the Hellenes:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Then shall the Colian women with firewood of oars roast barley.\" 61\r\n\r\nThis was destined to come to pass after the king had marched away.\r\n\r\n97. When Xerxes perceived the disaster which had come upon him, he\r\nfeared lest some one of the Ionians should suggest to the Hellenes,\r\nor they should themselves form the idea, to sail to the Hellespont and\r\nbreak up the bridges; and so he might be cut off in Europe and run the\r\nrisk of perishing utterly: therefore he began to consider about taking\r\nflight. He desired however that his intention should not be perceived\r\neither by the Hellenes or by those of his own side; therefore he\r\nattempted to construct a mole going across to Salamis, and he bound\r\ntogether Phenician merchant vessels in order that they might serve him\r\nboth for a bridge and a wall, and made preparations for fighting as if\r\nhe were going to have another battle by sea. Seeing him do so, all the\r\nrest made sure that he had got himself ready in earnest and intended to\r\nstay and fight; but Mardonios did not fail to perceive the true meaning\r\nof all these things, being by experience very well versed in his way of\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\n98. While Xerxes was doing thus, he sent a messenger to the Persians,\r\nto announce the calamity which had come upon them. Now there is\r\nnothing mortal which accomplishes a journey with more speed than these\r\nmessengers, so skilfully has this been invented by the Persians: for\r\nthey say that according to the number of days of which the entire\r\njourney consists, so many horses and men are set at intervals, each man\r\nand horse appointed for a day's journey. These neither snow nor rain nor\r\nheat nor darkness of night prevents from accomplishing each one the task\r\nproposed to him, with the very utmost speed. The first then rides and\r\ndelivers the message with which he is charged to the second, and the\r\nsecond to the third; and after that it goes through them handed from\r\none to the other, 62 as in the torch-race among the Hellenes, which\r\nthey perform for Hephaistos. This kind of running of their horses the\r\nPersians call angareion.\r\n\r\n99. The first message then which came to Susa, announcing that Xerxes\r\nhad Athens in his possession, so greatly rejoiced the Persians who had\r\nbeen left behind, that they strewed all the ways with myrtle boughs and\r\noffered incense perpetually, and themselves continued in sacrifices and\r\nfeasting. The second message however, which came to them after this,\r\nso greatly disturbed them that they all tore their garments and gave\r\nthemselves up to crying and lamentation without stint, laying the blame\r\nupon Mardonios: and this the Persians did not so much because they were\r\ngrieved about the ships, as because they feared for Xerxes himself.\r\n\r\n100. As regards the Persians this went on for all the time which\r\nintervened, until the coming of Xerxes himself caused them to cease:\r\nand Mardonios seeing that Xerxes was greatly troubled by reason of\r\nthe sea-fight, and suspecting that he was meaning to take flight from\r\nAthens, considered with regard to himself that he would have to suffer\r\npunishment for having persuaded the king to make an expedition against\r\nHellas, and that it was better for him to run the risk of either\r\nsubduing Hellas or ending his own life honourably, placing his safety in\r\nsuspense for a great end, 63 though his opinion was rather that he would\r\nsubdue Hellas;—he reckoned up these things, I say, and addressed his\r\nspeech to the king as follows: \"Master, be not thou grieved, nor feel\r\ngreat trouble on account of this thing which has come to pass; for it is\r\nnot upon a contest of timbers that all our fortunes depend, but of\r\nmen and of horses: and none of these who suppose now that all has been\r\nachieved by them will attempt to disembark from the ships and stand\r\nagainst thee, nor will any in this mainland do so; but those who did\r\nstand against us paid the penalty. If therefore thou thinkest this good\r\nto do, let us forthwith attempt the Peloponnese, or if thou thinkest\r\ngood to hold back, we may do that. Do not despond however, for there is\r\nno way of escape for the Hellenes to avoid being thy slaves, after they\r\nhave first given an account of that which they did to thee both now\r\nand at former times. Thus it were best to do; but if thou hast indeed\r\nresolved to retire thyself and to withdraw thy army, I have another\r\ncounsel to offer for that case too. Do not thou, O king, let the\r\nPersians be an object of laughter to the Hellenes; for none of thy\r\naffairs have suffered by means of the Persians, nor wilt thou be able to\r\nmention any place where we proved ourselves cowards: but if Phenicians\r\nor Egyptians or Cyprians or Kilikians proved themselves cowards, the\r\ncalamity which followed does not belong to the Persians in any way. Now\r\ntherefore, since it is not the Persians who are guilty towards thee,\r\nfollow my counsel. If thou hast determined not to remain here, retire\r\nthou to thine own abode, taking with thee the main body of the army,\r\nand it must then be for me to deliver over to thee Hellas reduced to\r\nsubjection, choosing for this purpose thirty myriads 64 from the army.\"\r\n\r\n101. Hearing this Xerxes was rejoiced and delighted so far as he might\r\nbe after his misfortunes, 65 and to Mardonios he said that when he had\r\ntaken counsel he would reply and say which of these two things he would\r\ndo. So when he was taking counsel with those of the Persians who\r\nwere called to be his advisers, 66 it seemed good to him to send for\r\nArtemisia also to give him counsel, because at the former time she alone\r\nhad showed herself to have perception of that which ought to be done. So\r\nwhen Artemisia had come, Xerxes removed from him all the rest, both the\r\nPersian councillors and also the spearmen of the guard and spoke to\r\nher thus: \"Mardonios bids me stay here and make an attempt on the\r\nPeloponnese, saying that the Persians and the land-army are not guilty\r\nof any share in my calamity, and that they would gladly give me proof of\r\nthis. He bids me therefore either do this or, if not, he desires himself\r\nto choose thirty myriads from the army and to deliver over to me Hellas\r\nreduced to subjection; and he bids me withdraw with the rest of the army\r\nto my own abode. Do thou therefore, as thou didst well advise about the\r\nsea-fight which was fought, urging that we should not bring it on, so\r\nalso now advise me which of these things I shall do, that I may succeed\r\nin determining well.\"\r\n\r\n102. He thus consulted her, and she spoke these words: \"O king, it is\r\nhard for me to succeed in saying the best things when one asks me for\r\ncounsel; yet it seems good to me at the present that thou shouldest\r\nretire back and leave Mardonios here, if he desires it and undertakes\r\nto do this, together with those whom he desires to have: for on the one\r\nhand if he subdue those whom he says that he desires to subdue, and if\r\nthose matters succeed well which he has in mind when he thus speaks, the\r\ndeed will after all be thine, master, seeing that thy slaves achieved\r\nit: and on the other hand if the opposite shall come to pass of that\r\nwhich Mardonios intends, it will be no great misfortune, seeing that\r\nthou wilt thyself remain safe, and also the power in those parts 67\r\nwhich concerns thy house: 68 for if thou shalt remain safe with thy\r\nhouse, many contests many times over repeated will the Hellenes have\r\nto pass through for their own existence. 69 Of Mardonios however, if\r\nhe suffer any disaster, no account will be made; and if the Hellenes\r\nconquer they gain a victory which is no victory, having destroyed one\r\nwho is but thy slave. Thou however wilt retire having done that for\r\nwhich thou didst make thy march, that is to say, having delivered Athens\r\nto the fire.\"\r\n\r\n103. With this advice Xerxes was greatly delighted, since she succeeded\r\nin saying that very thing which he himself was meaning to do: for not\r\neven if all the men and all the women in the world had been counselling\r\nhim to remain, would he have done so, as I think, so much had he been\r\nstruck with terror. He commended Artemisia therefore and sent her away\r\nto conduct his sons to Ephesos, for there were certain bastard sons of\r\nhis which accompanied him.\r\n\r\n104. With these sons he sent Hermotimos to have charge of them, who was\r\nby race of Pedasa and was in the estimation of the king second to none\r\nof the eunuchs. [Now the Pedasians dwell above Halicarnassos, and at\r\nthis Pedasa a thing happens as follows:—whenever to the whole number of\r\nthose who dwell about this city some trouble is about to come within\r\na certain time, then the priestess of Athene in that place gets a long\r\nbeard; and this has happened to them twice before now.\r\n\r\n105. Of these Pedasians was Hermotimos.] 70 And this man of all persons\r\nwhom we know up to this time obtained the greatest revenge for a wrong\r\ndone to him. For he had been captured by enemies and was being sold, and\r\nPanionios a man of Chios bought him, one who had set himself to gain his\r\nlivelihood by the most impious practices; for whenever he obtained\r\nboys who possessed some beauty, he would make eunuchs of them, and then\r\ntaking them to Sardis or Ephesos sold them for large sums of money,\r\nsince with the Barbarians eunuchs are held to be of more value for all\r\nmatters of trust than those who are not eunuchs. Panionios then, I say,\r\nmade eunuchs of many others, since by this he got his livelihood,\r\nand also of this man about whom I speak: and Hermotimos, being not in\r\neverything unfortunate, was sent from Sardis to the king with other\r\ngifts, and as time went on he came to be honoured more than all the\r\nother eunuchs in the sight of Xerxes.\r\n\r\n106. And when the king, being at that time in Sardis, was setting the\r\nPersian army in motion to march against Athens, then Hermotimos, having\r\ngone down for some business to that part of Mysia which the Chians\r\noccupy and which is called Atarneus, found there Panionios: and having\r\nrecognised him he spoke to him many friendly words, first recounting\r\nto him all the good things which he had by his means, and next making\r\npromises in return for this, and saying how many good things he would do\r\nfor him, if he would bring his household and dwell in that land; so that\r\nPanionios gladly accepting his proposals brought his children and\r\nhis wife. Then, when he had caught him together with his whole house,\r\nHermotimos spoke as follows: \"O thou, who of all men that ever lived up\r\nto this time didst gain thy substance by the most impious deeds, what\r\nevil did either I myself or any of my forefathers do either to thee\r\nor to any of thine, that thou didst make me to be that which is nought\r\ninstead of a man? Didst thou suppose that thou wouldest escape the\r\nnotice of the gods for such things as then thou didst devise? They\r\nhowever following the rule of justice delivered 71 thee into my hands,\r\nsince thou hadst done impious deeds; so that thou shalt not have reason\r\nto find fault with the penalty which shall be inflicted upon thee by\r\nme.\" When he had thus reproached him, the man's sons were brought into\r\nhis presence and Panionios was compelled to make eunuchs of his own\r\nsons, who were four in number, and being compelled he did so; and then\r\nwhen he had so done, the sons were compelled to do the same thing to\r\nhim. Thus vengeance by the hands of Hermotimos 72 overtook Panionios.\r\n\r\n107. When Xerxes had entrusted his sons to Artemisia to carry them back\r\nto Ephesos, he called Mardonios and bade him choose of the army whom he\r\nwould, and make his deeds, if possible, correspond to his words. During\r\nthis day then things went so far; and in the night on the command of\r\nthe king the leaders of the fleet began to withdraw their ships from\r\nPhaleron to the Hellespont, as quickly as they might each one, to guard\r\nthe bridges for the king to pass over. And when the Barbarians were\r\nnear Zoster as they sailed, then seeing the small points of rock which\r\nstretch out to sea from this part of the mainland, they thought\r\nthat these were ships and fled for a good distance. In time however,\r\nperceiving that they were not ships but points of rock, they assembled\r\ntogether again and continued on their voyage.\r\n\r\n108. When day dawned, the Hellenes, seeing that the land-army was\r\nstaying still in its place, supposed that the ships also were about\r\nPhaleron; and thinking that they would fight another sea-battle, they\r\nmade preparations to repel them. When however they were informed that\r\nthe ships had departed, forthwith upon this they thought it good to\r\npursue after them. They pursued therefore as far as Andros, but did not\r\nget a sight of the fleet of Xerxes; and when they had come to Andros,\r\nthey deliberated what they should do. Themistocles then declared as\r\nhis opinion that they should take their course through the islands and\r\npursue after the ships, and afterwards sail straight to the Hellespont\r\nto break up the bridges; but Eurybiades expressed the opposite opinion\r\nto this, saying that if they should break up the floating-bridges, they\r\nwould therein do 73 the greatest possible evil to Hellas: for if the\r\nPersian should be cut off and compelled to remain in Europe, he would\r\nendeavour not to remain still, since if he remained still, neither\r\ncould any of his affairs go forward, nor would any way of returning\r\nhome appear; but his army would perish of hunger: whereas if he made the\r\nattempt and persevered in it, all Europe might be brought over to\r\nhim, city by city and nation by nation, the inhabitants being either\r\nconquered 74 or surrendering on terms before they were conquered:\r\nmoreover they would have for food the crops of the Hellenes which grew\r\nyear by year. He thought however that conquered in the sea-fight the\r\nPersian would not stay in Europe, and therefore he might be allowed to\r\nflee until in his flight he came to his own land. Then after that they\r\nmight begin the contest for the land which belonged to the Persian. To\r\nthis opinion the commanders of the other Peloponnesians adhered also.\r\n\r\n109. When Themistocles perceived that he would not be able to persuade\r\nthem, or at least the greater number of them, to sail to the Hellespont,\r\nhe changed his counsel 75 and turning to the Athenians (for these were\r\ngrieved most at the escape of the enemy and were anxious to sail to the\r\nHellespont even by themselves alone, 76 if the others were not willing)\r\nto them he spoke as follows: \"I myself also have been present before now\r\non many occasions, and have heard of many more, on which something\r\nof this kind came to pass, namely that men who were forced into great\r\nstraits, after they had been defeated fought again and repaired their\r\nformer disaster: and as for us, since we have won as a prize from\r\nfortune the existence of ourselves and of Hellas by repelling from our\r\nland so great a cloud of men, let us not pursue enemies who flee from\r\nus: for of these things not we were the doors, but the gods and heroes,\r\nwho grudged that one man should become king of both Asia and of Europe,\r\nand he a man unholy and presumptuous, one who made no difference between\r\nthings sacred and things profane, 77 burning and casting down the images\r\nof the gods, and who also scourged the Sea and let down into it fetters.\r\nBut as things are at present, it is well that we should now remain in\r\nHellas and look after ourselves and our households; and let each man\r\nrepair his house, and have a care for sowing his land, after he has\r\ncompletely driven away the Barbarian: and then at the beginning of\r\nthe spring let us sail down towards the Hellespont and Ionia.\" Thus he\r\nspoke, intending to lay up for himself a store of gratitude with the\r\nPersian, in order that if after all any evil should come upon him at the\r\nhands of the Athenians, he might have a place of refuge: and this was in\r\nfact that which came to pass.\r\n\r\n110. Themistocles then speaking thus endeavoured to deceive them, and\r\nthe Athenians followed his advice: for he had had the reputation even in\r\nformer times of being a man of ability 78 and he had now proved himself\r\nto be in truth both able and of good judgment; therefore they were ready\r\nin every way to follow his advice when he spoke. So when these had been\r\npersuaded by him, forthwith after this Themistocles sent men with a\r\nvessel, whom he trusted to keep silence, to whatever test they might be\r\nbrought, of that which he himself charged them to tell the king; and of\r\nthem Sikinnos his servant again was one. When these came to Attica, the\r\nrest stayed behind in the ship, while Sikinnos went up to Xerxes and\r\nspoke these words: \"Themistocles the son of Neocles sent me, who is\r\ncommander of the Athenians, and of all the allies the best and ablest\r\nman, to tell thee that Themistocles the Athenian, desiring to be of\r\nservice to thee, held back the Hellenes when they were desirous to\r\npursue after thy ships and to destroy the bridges on the Hellespont. Now\r\ntherefore thou mayest make thy way home quite undisturbed.\" They having\r\nsignified this sailed away again.\r\n\r\n111. The Hellenes meanwhile, having resolved not to pursue after the\r\nships of the Barbarians further, nor to sail to the Hellespont to break\r\nup the passage, were investing Andros intending to take it: for\r\nthe Andrians were the first of the islanders who, being asked by\r\nThemistocles for money, refused to give it: and when Themistocles made\r\nproposals to them and said that the Athenians had come having on their\r\nside two great deities, Persuasion and Compulsion, and therefore they\r\nmust by all means give them money, they replied to this that not without\r\nreason, as it now appeared, was Athens great and prosperous, since the\r\nAthenians were well supplied with serviceable deities; but as for the\r\nAndrians, they were poor, 79 having in this respect attained to the\r\ngreatest eminence, and there were two unprofitable deities which never\r\nleft their island but always remained attached to the place, Poverty,\r\nnamely, and Helplessness: and the Andrians being possessed of these\r\ndeities would not give money; for never could the power of the Athenians\r\nget the better of their inability. 80\r\n\r\n112. These, I say, having thus made answer and having refused to give\r\nthe money, were being besieged: and Themistocles not ceasing in his\r\ndesire for gain sent threatening messages to the other islands and asked\r\nthem for money by the same envoys, employing those whom he had before\r\nsent to the king; 81 and he said that if they did not give that which\r\nwas demanded of them, he would bring the fleet of the Hellenes against\r\nthem to besiege and take them. Thus saying he collected great sums of\r\nmoney from the Carystians and the Parians, who being informed how Andros\r\nwas being besieged, because it had taken the side of the Medes, and how\r\nThemistocles was held in more regard than any of the other commanders,\r\nsent money for fear of this. Whether any others of the islanders also\r\ngave money I am not able to say, but I think that some others gave and\r\nnot these alone. Yet to the Carystians at least there was no respite\r\nfrom the evil on this account, but the Parians escaped the attack,\r\nbecause they propitiated Themistocles with money. Thus Themistocles with\r\nAndros as his starting-point was acquiring sums of money for himself\r\nfrom the men of the islands without the knowledge of the other\r\ncommanders.\r\n\r\n113. Xerxes meanwhile with his army stayed for a few days after the\r\nsea-fight, and then they all began to march forth towards Boeotia by the\r\nsame way by which they had come: for Mardonios thought both that it was\r\nwell for him to escort the king on his way, and also that it was now\r\ntoo late in the year to carry on the war; it was better, he thought, to\r\nwinter in Thessaly and then at the beginning of spring to attempt the\r\nPeloponnese. When he came to Thessaly, then Mardonios chose out for\r\nhimself first all those Persians who are called \"Immortals,\" except only\r\ntheir commander Hydarnes (for Hydarnes said that he would not be left\r\nbehind by the king), and after them of the other Persians those who wore\r\ncuirasses, and the body of a thousand horse: also the Medes, Sacans,\r\nBactrians and Indians, foot and horsemen both. 82 These nations he chose\r\nin the mass, 83 but from the other allies he selected by few at a time,\r\nchoosing whose who had fine appearance of those of whom he knew that\r\nthey had done good service. From the Persians he chose more than from\r\nany other single nation, and these wore collars of twisted metal and\r\nbracelets; and after them came the Medes, who in fact were not inferior\r\nin number to the Persians, but only in bodily strength. The result was\r\nthat there were thirty myriads in all, including cavalry.\r\n\r\n114. During this time, while Mardonios was selecting his army and\r\nXerxes was in Thessaly, there had come an oracle from Delphi to the\r\nLacedemonians, bidding them ask satisfaction from Xerxes for the murder\r\nof Leonidas and accept that which should be given by him. The Spartans\r\ntherefore sent a herald as quickly as possible, who having found the\r\nwhole army still in Thessaly came into the presence of Xerxes and spoke\r\nthese words: \"O king of the Medes, the Lacedemonians and the sons of\r\nHeracles of Sparta demand of thee satisfaction for murder, because thou\r\ndidst kill their king, fighting in defence of Hellas.\" He laughed and\r\nthen kept silence some time, and after that pointing to Mardonios, who\r\nhappened to be standing by him, he said: \"Then Mardonios here shall give\r\nthem satisfaction, such as is fitting for them to have.\"\r\n\r\n115. The herald accordingly accepted the utterance and departed; and\r\nXerxes leaving Mardonios in Thessaly went on himself in haste to\r\nthe Hellespont and arrived at the passage where the crossing was in\r\nfive-and-thirty days, bringing back next to nothing, as one may say, 84\r\nof his army: and whithersoever they came on the march and to whatever\r\nnation, they seized the crops of that people and used them for\r\nprovisions; and if they found no crops, then they took the grass which\r\nwas growing up from the earth, and stripped off the bark from the trees\r\nand plucked down the leaves and devoured them, alike of the cultivated\r\ntrees and of those growing wild; and they left nothing behind them: thus\r\nthey did by reason of famine. Then plague too seized upon the army and\r\ndysentery, which destroyed them by the way, and some of them also who\r\nwere sick the king left behind, laying charge upon the cities where at\r\nthe time he chanced to be in his march, to take care of them and support\r\nthem: of these he left some in Thessaly, and some at Siris in Paionia,\r\nand some in Macedonia. In these parts too he had left behind him the\r\nsacred chariot of Zeus, when he was marching against Hellas; but on his\r\nreturn he did not receive it back: for the Paionians had given it to the\r\nThracians, and when Xerxes asked for it again, they said that the mares\r\nwhile at pasture had been carried off by the Thracians of the upper\r\ncountry, who dwelt about the source of the Strymon.\r\n\r\n116. Here also a Thracian, the king of the Bisaltians and of the\r\nCrestonian land, did a deed of surpassing horror; for he had said that\r\nhe would not himself be subject to Xerxes with his own will and had gone\r\naway up to Mount Rhodope, and also he had forbidden his sons to go on\r\nthe march against Hellas. They however, either because they cared not\r\nfor his command, or else because a desire came upon them to see the war,\r\nwent on the march with the Persian: and when they returned all unhurt,\r\nbeing six in number, their father plucked out their eyes for this cause.\r\n\r\n117. They then received this reward: and as to the Persians, when\r\npassing on from Thrace they came to the passage, they crossed over the\r\nHellespont in haste to Abydos by means of the ships, for they did not\r\nfind the floating-bridges still stretched across but broken up by a\r\nstorm. While staying there for a time they had distributed to them an\r\nallowance of food more abundant than they had had by the way, and from\r\nsatisfying their hunger without restraint and also from the changes of\r\nwater there died many of those in the army who had remained safe till\r\nthen. The rest arrived with Xerxes at Sardis.\r\n\r\n118. There is also another story reported as follows, namely that when\r\nXerxes on his march away from Athens came to Eïon on the Strymon, from\r\nthat point he did not continue further to make marches by road, but\r\ndelivered his army to Hydarnes to lead back to the Hellespont, while he\r\nhimself embarked in a Phenician ship and set forth for Asia; and as he\r\nsailed he was seized by a wind from the Strymon, 85 violent and raising\r\ngreat waves; and since he was tossed by the storm more and more, the\r\nship being heavily laden (for there were upon the deck great numbers of\r\nPersians, those namely who went with Xerxes), the king upon that falling\r\ninto fear shouted aloud and asked the pilot whether there were for them\r\nany means of safety. He said: \"Master, there are none, unless some way\r\nbe found of freeing ourselves of the excessive number of passengers.\"\r\nThen it is said that Xerxes, when he heard this, spoke thus: \"Persians,\r\nnow let each one of you show that he has care for the king; for my\r\nsafety, as it seems, depends upon you.\" He, they say, thus spoke, and\r\nthey made obeisance to him and leapt out into the sea; and so the ship\r\nbeing lightened came safe to Asia. As soon as they had landed Xerxes,\r\nthey say, first presented the pilot with a wreath of gold, because he\r\nhad saved the life of the king, and then cut off his head, because he\r\nhad caused the death of many of the Persians.\r\n\r\n119. This other story, I say, is reported about the return of Xerxes,\r\nbut I for my part can by no means believe it, either in other respects\r\nor as regards this which is said to have happened to the Persians; for\r\nif this which I have related had in truth been said by the pilot to\r\nXerxes, not one person's opinion in ten thousand will differ from mine\r\nthat the king would have done some such thing as this, that is to say,\r\nhe would have caused those who were upon the deck to go down below into\r\nthe hold, seeing that they were Persians of the highest rank among the\r\nPersians; and of the rowers, who were Phenicians, he would have thrown\r\nout into the sea a number equal to the number of those. In fact however,\r\nas I have said before, he made his return to Asia together with the rest\r\nof the army by road.\r\n\r\n120. And this also which follows is a strong witness that it was so; for\r\nXerxes is known to have come to Abdera on his way back, and to have made\r\nwith them a guest-friendship and presented them with a Persian sword of\r\ngold and a gold-spangled tiara: and as the men of Abdera themselves say\r\n(though I for my part can by no means believe it), he loosed his girdle\r\nfor the first time during his flight back from Athens, considering\r\nhimself to be in security. Now Abdera is situated further towards the\r\nHellespont than the river Strymon and Eïon, from which place the story\r\nsays that he embarked in the ship.\r\n\r\n121. The Hellenes meanwhile, when it proved that they were not able to\r\nconquer Andros, turned towards Carystos, and having laid waste the land\r\nof that people they departed and went to Salamis. First then for the\r\ngods they chose out first-fruits of the spoil, and among them three\r\nPersian triremes, one to be dedicated as an offering at the Isthmus,\r\nwhich remained there still up to my time, another at Sunion, and the\r\nthird to Ajax in Salamis where they were. After this they divided the\r\nspoil among themselves and sent the first-fruits 86 to Delphi, of which\r\nwas made a statue holding in its hand the beak of a ship and in height\r\nmeasuring twelve cubits. This statue stood in the same place with the\r\ngolden statue of Alexander the Macedonian.\r\n\r\n122. Then when the Hellenes had sent first-fruits to Delphi, they asked\r\nthe god on behalf of all whether the first-fruits which he had received\r\nwere fully sufficient and acceptable to him. He said that from the\r\nHellenes he had received enough, but not from the Eginetans, and from\r\nthem he demanded the offering of their prize of valour for the sea-fight\r\nat Salamis. Hearing this the Eginetans dedicated golden stars, three in\r\nnumber, upon a ship's mast of bronze, which are placed in the corner 87\r\nclose to the mixing-bowl of Croesus.\r\n\r\n123. After the division of the spoil the Hellenes sailed to the Isthmus,\r\nto give the prize of valour to him who of all the Hellenes had proved\r\nhimself the most worthy during this war: and when they had come thither\r\nand the commanders distributed 88 their votes at the altar of Poseidon,\r\nselecting from the whole number the first and the second in merit, then\r\nevery one of them gave in his vote for himself, each man thinking that\r\nhe himself had been the best; but for the second place the greater\r\nnumber of votes came out in agreement, assigning that to Themistocles.\r\nThey then were left alone in their votes, while Themistocles in regard\r\nto the second place surpassed the rest by far:\r\n\r\n124, and although the Hellenes would not give decision of this by reason\r\nof envy, but sailed away each to their own city without deciding, yet\r\nThemistocles was loudly reported of and was esteemed throughout Hellas\r\nto be the man who was the ablest 89 by far of the Hellenes: and since he\r\nhad not received honour from those who had fought at Salamis, although\r\nhe was the first in the voting, he went forthwith after this to\r\nLacedemon, desiring to receive honour there; and the Lacedemonians\r\nreceived him well and gave him great honours. As a prize of valour they\r\ngave to Eurybiades a wreath of olive; and for ability and skill they\r\ngave to Themistocles also a wreath of olive, and presented him besides\r\nwith the chariot which was judged to be the best in Sparta. So having\r\nmuch commended him, they escorted him on his departure with three\r\nhundred picked men of the Spartans, the same who are called the\r\n\"horsemen,\" 90 as far as the boundaries of Tegea: and he is the only man\r\nof all we know to whom the Spartans ever gave escort on his way.\r\n\r\n125. When however he had come to Athens from Lacedemon, Timodemos of\r\nAphidnai, one of the opponents of Themistocles, but in other respects\r\nnot among the men of distinction, maddened by envy attacked him,\r\nbringing forward against him his going to Lacedemon, and saying that it\r\nwas on account of Athens that he had those marks of honour which he had\r\nfrom the Lacedemonians, and not on his own account. Then, as Timodemos\r\ncontinued ceaselessly to repeat this, Themistocles said: \"I tell thee\r\nthus it is:—if I had been a native of Belbina 91 I should never have\r\nbeen thus honoured by the Spartans; but neither wouldest thou, my\r\nfriend, for all that thou art an Athenian.\" So far then went these\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n126. Artabazos meanwhile the son of Pharnakes, a man who was held in\r\nesteem among the Persians even before this and came to be so yet more\r\nafter the events about Plataia, was escorting the king as far as the\r\npassage with six myriads 92 of that army which Mardonios had selected\r\nfor himself; and when the king was in Asia and Artabazos on his march\r\nback came near to Pallene, finding that Mardonios was wintering in\r\nThessaly and Macedonia and was not at present urgent with him to come\r\nand join the rest of the army, he thought it not good to pass by without\r\nreducing the Potidaians to slavery, whom he had found in revolt: for the\r\nmen of Potidaia, when the king had marched by them and when the fleet of\r\nthe Persians had departed in flight from Salamis, had openly made revolt\r\nfrom the Barbarians; and so also had the others done who occupy Pallene.\r\n\r\n127. So upon this Artabazos began to besiege Potidaia, and suspecting\r\nthat the men of Olynthos also were intending revolt from the king, he\r\nbegan to besiege this city too, which was occupied by Bottiaians who had\r\nbeen driven away from the Thermaian gulf by the Macedonians. So when he\r\nhad taken these men by siege, he brought them forth to a lake and slew\r\nthem 93 there; and the city he delivered to Critobulos of Torone to have\r\nin charge, and to the natives of Chalkidike; and thus it was that the\r\nChalkidians got possession of Olynthos.\r\n\r\n128. Having taken this city Artabazos set himself to attack Potidaia\r\nwith vigour, and as he was setting himself earnestly to this work,\r\nTimoxeinos the commander of the troops from Skione concerted with him\r\nto give up the town by treachery. Now in what manner he did this at the\r\nfirst, I for my part am not able to say, for this is not reported; at\r\nlast however it happened as follows. Whenever either Timoxeinos wrote a\r\npaper wishing to send it to Artabazos, or Artabazos wishing to send one\r\nto Timoxeinos, they wound it round by the finger-notches 94 of an arrow,\r\nand then, putting feathers over the paper, they shot it to a place\r\nagreed upon between them. It came however to be found out that\r\nTimoxeinos was attempting by treachery to give up Potidaia; for\r\nArtabazos, shooting an arrow at the place agreed upon, missed this spot\r\nand struck a man of Potidaia in the shoulder; and when he was struck,\r\na crowd came about him, as is apt to happen when there is fighting, and\r\nthey forthwith took the arrow and having discovered the paper carried\r\nit to the commanders. Now there was present an allied force of the other\r\nmen of Pallene also. Then when the commanders had read the paper and\r\ndiscovered who was guilty of the treachery, they resolved not openly to\r\nconvict 95 Timoxeinos of treachery, for the sake of the city of Skione,\r\nlest the men of Skione should be esteemed traitors for all time to come.\r\n\r\n129. He then in such a manner as this had been discovered; and when\r\nthree months had gone by while Artabazos was besieging the town, there\r\ncame to be a great ebb of the sea backwards, which lasted for a long\r\ntime; and the Barbarians, seeing that shallow water had been produced,\r\nendeavoured to get by into the peninsula of Pallene, 96 but when they\r\nhad passed through two fifth-parts of the distance, and yet three-fifths\r\nremained, which they must pass through before they were within Pallene,\r\nthen there came upon them a great flood-tide of the sea, higher than\r\never before, as the natives of the place say, though high tides come\r\noften. So those of them who could not swim perished, and those who could\r\nwere slain by the men of Potidaia who put out to them in boats. The\r\ncause of the high tide and flood and of that which befell the Persians\r\nwas this, as the Potidaians say, namely that these same Persians who\r\nperished by means of the sea had committed impiety towards the temple of\r\nPoseidon and his image in the suburb of their town; and in saying that\r\nthis was the cause, in my opinion they say well. The survivors of his\r\narmy Artabazos led away to Thessaly to join Mardonios. Thus it fared\r\nwith these who escorted the king on his way.\r\n\r\n130. The fleet of Xerxes, so much of it as remained, when it had touched\r\nAsia in its flight from Salamis, and had conveyed the king and his army\r\nover from the Chersonese to Abydos, passed the winter at Kyme: and when\r\nspring dawned upon it, it assembled early at Samos, where some of the\r\nships had even passed the winter; and most of the Persians and Medes\r\nstill served as fighting-men on board of them. 97 To be commanders of\r\nthem there came Mardontes the son of Bagaios, and Artaÿntes the son of\r\nArtachaies, and with them also Ithamitres was in joint command, who was\r\nbrother's son to Artaÿntes and had been added by the choice of Artaÿntes\r\nhimself. They then, since they had suffered a heavy blow, did not\r\nadvance further up towards the West, nor did any one compel them to do\r\nso; but they remained still in Samos and kept watch over Ionia, lest\r\nit should revolt, having three hundred ships including those of the\r\nIonians; and they did not expect that the Hellenes on their part would\r\ncome to Ionia, but thought that it would satisfy them to guard their\r\nown land, judging from the fact that they had not pursued after them\r\nin their flight from Salamis but were well contented then to depart\r\nhomewards. As regards the sea then their spirit was broken, but on land\r\nthey thought that Mardonios would get much the advantage. So they being\r\nat Samos were taking counsel to do some damage if they could to their\r\nenemies, and at the same time they were listening for news how the\r\naffairs of Mardonios would fall out.\r\n\r\n131. The Hellenes on their part were roused both by the coming on of\r\nspring and by the presence of Mardonios in Thessaly. Their land-army had\r\nnot yet begun to assemble, when the fleet arrived at Egina, in\r\nnumber one hundred and ten ships, and the commander and admiral was\r\nLeotychides, who was the son of Menares, the son of Hegesilaos, the son\r\nof Hippocratides, the son of Leotychides, the son of Anaxilaos, the son\r\nof Archidemos, the son of Anaxandriddes, the son of Theopompos, the son\r\nof Nicander, the son of Charilaos, 98 the son of Eunomos, the son of\r\nPolydectes, the son of Prytanis, the son of Euryphon, 99 the son of\r\nProcles, the son of Aristodemos, the son of Aristomachos, the son of\r\nCleodaios, the son of Hyllos, the son of Heracles, being of the other\r\nroyal house. 100 These all, except the two 101 enumerated first\r\nafter Leotychides, had been kings of Sparta. And of the Athenians the\r\ncommander was Xanthippos the son of Ariphon.\r\n\r\n132. When all the ships had arrived at Egina, there came Ionian envoys\r\nto the camp of the Hellenes, who also came a short time before this to\r\nSparta and asked the Lacedemonians to set Ionia free; and of them\r\none was Herodotus the son of Basileides. These had banded themselves\r\ntogether and had plotted to put to death Strattis the despot of Chios,\r\nbeing originally seven in number; but when one of those who took part\r\nwith them gave information of it and they were discovered to be plotting\r\nagainst him, then the remaining six escaped from Chios and came both to\r\nSparta and also at this time to Egina, asking the Hellenes to sail over\r\nto Ionia: but they with difficulty brought them forward as far as Delos;\r\nfor the parts beyond this were all fearful to the Hellenes, since they\r\nwere without experience of those regions and everything seemed to them\r\nto be filled with armed force, while their persuasion was that it was as\r\nlong a voyage to Samos as to the Pillars of Heracles. Thus at the same\r\ntime it so chanced that the Barbarians dared sail no further up towards\r\nthe West than Samos, being smitten with fear, and the Hellenes no\r\nfurther down towards the East than Delos, when the Chians made request\r\nof them. So fear was guard of the space which lay between them.\r\n\r\n133. The Hellenes, I say, sailed to Delos; and Mardonios meanwhile had\r\nbeen wintering in Thessaly. From thence he sent round a man, a native of\r\nEuropos, whose name was Mys, to the various Oracles, charging him to\r\ngo everywhere to consult, 102 wherever they 103 were permitted to make\r\ntrial of the Oracles. What he desired to find out from the Oracles when\r\nhe gave this charge, I am not able to say, for that is not reported; but\r\nI conceive for my part that he sent to consult about his present affairs\r\nand not about other things.\r\n\r\n134. This Mys is known to have come to Lebadeia and to have persuaded\r\nby payment of money one of the natives of the place to go down to\r\nTrophonios, and also he came to the Oracle at Abai of the Phokians;\r\nand moreover when he came for the first time to Thebes, he not only\r\nconsulted the Ismenian Apollo,—there one may consult just as at Olympia\r\nwith victims,—but also by payment he persuaded a stranger who was not\r\na Theban, and induced him to lie down to sleep in the temple of\r\nAmphiaraos. In this temple no one of the Thebans is permitted to seek\r\ndivination, and that for the following reason:—Amphiaraos dealing by\r\noracles bade them choose which they would of these two things, either\r\nto have him as a diviner or else as an ally in war, abstaining from the\r\nother use; and they chose that he should be their ally in war: for this\r\nreason it is not permitted to any of the Thebans to lie down to sleep in\r\nthat temple.\r\n\r\n135. After this a thing which to me is a very great marvel is said by\r\nthe Thebans to have come to pass:—it seems that this man Mys of Europos,\r\nas he journeyed round to all the Oracles, came also to the sacred\r\nenclosure of the Ptoan Apollo. This temple is called \"Ptoon,\" and\r\nbelongs to the Thebans, and it lies above the lake Copaïs at the foot of\r\nthe mountains, close to the town of Acraiphia. When the man called Mys\r\ncame to this temple with three men chosen from the citizens 104 in his\r\ncompany, who were sent by the public authority to write down that which\r\nthe god should utter in his divination, forthwith it is said the prophet\r\n105 of the god began to give the oracle in a Barbarian tongue; and while\r\nthose of the Thebans who accompanied him were full of wonder, hearing a\r\nBarbarian instead of the Hellenic tongue, and did not know what to make\r\nof the matter before them, it is said that the man of Europos, Mys,\r\nsnatched from them the tablet which they bore and wrote upon it that\r\nwhich was being spoken by the prophet; and he said that the prophet was\r\ngiving his answer in the Carian tongue: and then when he had written it,\r\nhe went away and departed to Thessaly.\r\n\r\n136. Mardonios having read that which the Oracles uttered, whatever that\r\nwas, after this sent as an envoy to Athens Alexander the son of Amyntas,\r\nthe Macedonian, both because the Persians were connected with him by\r\nmarriage, (for Gygaia the sister of Alexander and daughter of Amyntas\r\nhad been married to a Persian Bubares, 106 and from her had been born\r\nto him that Amyntas who lived in Asia, having the name of his mother's\r\nfather, to whom the king gave Alabanda, 107 a great city of Phrygia,\r\nto possess), and also Mardonios was sending him because he was\r\ninformed that Alexander was a public guest-friend and benefactor of the\r\nAthenians; for by this means he thought that he would be most likely to\r\ngain over the Athenians to his side, about whom he heard that they were\r\na numerous people and brave in war, and of whom he knew moreover that\r\nthese were they who more than any others had brought about the disasters\r\nwhich had befallen the Persians by sea. Therefore if these should be\r\nadded to him, he thought that he should easily have command of the sea\r\n(and this in fact would have been the case), while on land he supposed\r\nhimself to be already much superior in force. Thus he reckoned that his\r\npower would be much greater than that of the Hellenes. Perhaps also the\r\nOracles told him this beforehand, counselling him to make the Athenian\r\nhis ally, and so he was sending in obedience to their advice.\r\n\r\n137. Now of this Alexander the seventh ancestor 108 was that Perdiccas\r\nwho first became despot of the Macedonians, and that in the manner which\r\nhere follows:—From Argos there fled to the Illyrians three brothers of\r\nthe descendents of Temenos, Gauanes, Aëropos, and Perdiccas; and passing\r\nover from the Illyrians into the upper parts of Macedonia they came\r\nto the city of Lebaia. There they became farm-servants for pay in the\r\nhousehold of the king, one pasturing horses, the second oxen, and the\r\nyoungest of them, namely Perdiccas, the smaller kinds of cattle; for 109\r\nin ancient times even those who were rulers over men 110 were poor in\r\nmoney, and not the common people only; and the wife of the king cooked\r\nfor them their food herself. And whenever she baked, the loaf of the boy\r\ntheir servant, namely Perdiccas, became double as large as by nature it\r\nshould be. When this happened constantly in the same manner, she told\r\nit to her husband, and he when he heard it conceived forthwith that\r\nthis was a portent and tended to something great. He summoned the\r\nfarm-servants therefore, and gave notice to them to depart out of his\r\nland; and they said that it was right that before they went forth they\r\nshould receive the wages which were due. Now it chanced that the sun\r\nwas shining into the house down through the opening which received the\r\nsmoke, and the king when he heard about the wages said, being infatuated\r\nby a divine power: \"I pay you then this for wages, and it is such as\r\nye deserve,\" pointing to the sunlight. So then Gauanes and Aëropos the\r\nelder brothers stood struck with amazement when they heard this, but\r\nthe boy, who happened to have in his hand a knife, said these words: \"We\r\naccept, O king, that which thou dost give;\" and he traced a line with\r\nhis knife round the sunlight on the floor of the house, and having\r\ntraced the line round he thrice drew of the sunlight into his bosom, and\r\nafter that he departed both himself and his fellows.\r\n\r\n138. They then were going away, and to the king one of those who sat\r\nby him at table told what manner of thing the boy had done, and how the\r\nyoungest of them had taken that which was given with some design: and\r\nhe hearing this and being moved with anger, sent after them horsemen to\r\nslay them. Now there is a river in this land to which the descendents of\r\nthese men from Argos sacrifice as a saviour. This river, so soon as the\r\nsons of Temenos had passed over it, began to flow with such great volume\r\nof water that the horsemen became unable to pass over. So the brothers,\r\nhaving come to another region of Macedonia, took up their dwelling near\r\nthe so-called gardens of Midas the son of Gordias, where roses grow wild\r\nwhich have each one sixty petals and excel all others in perfume.\r\nIn these gardens too Silenos was captured, as is reported by the\r\nMacedonians: and above the gardens is situated a mountain called\r\nBermion, which is inaccessible by reason of the cold. Having taken\r\npossession of that region, they made this their starting-point, and\r\nproceeded to subdue also the rest of Macedonia.\r\n\r\n139. From this Perdiccas the descent of Alexander was as\r\nfollows:—Alexander was the son of Amyntas, Amyntas was the son of\r\nAlketes, the father of Alketes was Aëropos, of him Philip, of Philip\r\nArgaios, and of this last the father was Perdiccas, who first obtained\r\nthe kingdom.\r\n\r\n140. Thus then, I say, Alexander the son of Amyntas was descended; and\r\nwhen he came to Athens sent from Mardonios, he spoke as follows: (a)\r\n\"Athenians, Mardonios speaks these words:—There has come to me a message\r\nfrom the king which speaks in this manner:—To the Athenians I remit all\r\nthe offences which were committed against me: and now, Mardonios,\r\nthus do,—first give them back their own land; then let them choose\r\nfor themselves another in addition to this, whichsoever they desire,\r\nremaining independent; and set up for them again all their temples,\r\nwhich I set on fire, provided that they consent to make a treaty with\r\nme. This message having come to me, it is necessary for me to do so,\r\nunless by your means I am prevented: and thus I speak to you now:—Why\r\nare ye so mad as to raise up war against the king? since neither will ye\r\novercome him, nor are ye able to hold out against him for ever: for\r\nye saw the multitude of the host of Xerxes and their deeds, and ye are\r\ninformed also of the power which is with me at the present time; so that\r\neven if ye overcome and conquer us (of which ye can have no hope if ye\r\nare rightly minded), another power will come many times as large. Do\r\nnot ye then desire to match yourselves with the king, and so to be both\r\ndeprived of your land and for ever running a course for your own lives;\r\nbut make peace with him: and ye have a most honourable occasion to make\r\npeace, since the king has himself set out upon this road: agree to a\r\nleague with us then without fraud or deceit, and remain free. (b) These\r\nthings Mardonios charged me to say to you, O Athenians; and as for me,\r\nI will say nothing of the goodwill towards you on my part, for ye\r\nwould not learn that now for the first time; but I ask of you to do as\r\nMardonios says, since I perceive that ye will not be able to war with\r\nXerxes for ever,—if I perceived in you ability to do this, I should\r\nnever have come to you speaking these words,—for the power of the king\r\nis above that of a man and his arm is very long. If therefore ye do not\r\nmake an agreement forthwith, when they offer you great things as the\r\nterms on which they are willing to make a treaty, I have fear on your\r\nbehalf, seeing that ye dwell more upon the highway than any of your\r\nallies, and are exposed ever to destruction alone, the land which ye\r\npossess being parted off from the rest and lying between the armies\r\nwhich are contending together. 111 Nay, but be persuaded, for this is\r\na matter of great consequence to you, that to you alone of the Hellenes\r\nthe great king remits the offences committed and desires to become a\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\n141. Thus spoke Alexander; and the Lacedemonians having been informed\r\nthat Alexander had come to Athens to bring the Athenians to make a\r\ntreaty with the Barbarians, and remembering the oracles, who it was\r\ndestined that they together with the other Dorians should be driven\r\nforth out of the Peloponnese by the Medes and the Athenians combined,\r\nhad been very greatly afraid lest the Athenians should make a treaty\r\nwith the Persians; and forthwith they had resolved to send envoys.\r\nIt happened moreover that they were introduced at the same time with\r\nAlexander; 112 for the Athenians had waited for them, protracting the\r\ntime, because they were well assured that the Lacedemonians would hear\r\nthat an envoy had come from the Barbarians to make a treaty, and that\r\nhaving heard it they would themselves send envoys with all speed. They\r\nacted therefore of set purpose, so as to let the Lacedemonians see their\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\n142. So when Alexander had ceased speaking, the envoys from Sparta\r\nfollowed him forthwith and said: \"As for us, the Lacedemonians sent us\r\nto ask of you not to make any change in that which concerns Hellas, nor\r\nto accept proposals from the Barbarian; since this is not just in any\r\nway nor honourable for any of the Hellenes to do, but least of all for\r\nyou, and that for many reasons. Ye were they who stirred up this war,\r\nwhen we by no means willed it; and the contest came about for your\r\ndominion, but now it extends even to the whole of Hellas. Besides this\r\nit is by no means to be endured that ye Athenians, who are the authors\r\nof all this, should prove to be the cause of slavery to the Hellenes,\r\nseeing that ye ever from ancient time also have been known as the\r\nliberators of many. We feel sympathy however with you for your\r\nsufferings and because ye were deprived of your crops twice and have had\r\nyour substance ruined now for a long time. In compensation for this the\r\nLacedemonians and their allies make offer to support your wives and all\r\nthose of your households who are unfitted for war, so long as this war\r\nshall last: but let not Alexander the Macedonian persuade you, making\r\nsmooth the speech of Mardonios; for these things are fitting for him to\r\ndo, since being himself a despot he is working in league with a despot:\r\nfor you however they are not fitting to do, if ye chance to be rightly\r\nminded; for ye know that in Barbarians there is neither faith nor truth\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke the envoys:\r\n\r\n143, and to Alexander the Athenians made answer thus: \"Even of ourselves\r\nwe know so much, that the Mede has a power many times as numerous as\r\nours; so that there is no need for thee to cast this up against us.\r\nNevertheless because we long for liberty we shall defend ourselves as we\r\nmay be able: and do not thou endeavour to persuade us to make a treaty\r\nwith the Barbarian, for we on our part shall not be persuaded. And now\r\nreport to Mardonios that the Athenians say thus:—So long as the Sun goes\r\non the same course by which he goes now, we will never make an agreement\r\nwith Xerxes; but we will go forth to defend ourselves 113 against\r\nhim, trusting in the gods and the heroes as allies, for whom he had no\r\nrespect when he set fire to their houses and to their sacred images.\r\nAnd in the future do not thou appear before the Athenians with any such\r\nproposals as these, nor think that thou art rendering them good service\r\nin advising them to do that which is not lawful; for we do not desire\r\nthat thou shouldest suffer anything unpleasant at the hands of the\r\nAthenians, who art their public guest and friend.\"\r\n\r\n144. To Alexander they thus made answer, but to the envoys from Sparta\r\nas follows: \"That the Lacedemonians should be afraid lest we should make\r\na treaty with the Barbarian was natural no doubt; 114 but it seems to be\r\nan unworthy fear for men who know so well the spirit of the Athenians,\r\nnamely that there is neither so great quantity of gold anywhere upon the\r\nearth, nor any land so much excelling in beauty and goodness, that we\r\nshould be willing to accept it and enslave Hellas by taking the side of\r\nthe Medes. For many and great are the reasons which hinder us from doing\r\nthis, even though we should desire it; first and greatest the images\r\nand houses of the gods set on fire or reduced to ruin, which we must\r\nnecessarily avenge to the very utmost rather than make an agreement with\r\nhim who did these deeds; then secondly there is the bond of Hellenic\r\nrace, by which we are of one blood and of one speech, the common temples\r\nof the gods and the common sacrifices, the manners of life which are the\r\nsame for all; to these it would not be well that the Athenians should\r\nbecome traitors. And be assured of this, if by any chance ye were not\r\nassured of it before, that so long as one of the Athenians remains\r\nalive, we will never make an agreement with Xerxes. We admire however\r\nthe forethought which ye had with regard to us, in that ye took thought\r\nfor us who have had our substance destroyed, and are willing to support\r\nthe members of our households; and so far as ye are concerned, the\r\nkindness has been fully performed: but we shall continue to endure as\r\nwe may, and not be a trouble in any way to you. Now therefore, with full\r\nconviction this is so, send out an army as speedily as ye may: for, as\r\nwe conjecture, the Barbarian will be here invading our land at no far\r\ndistant time but so soon as he shall be informed of the message sent,\r\nnamely that we shall do none of those things which he desired of us.\r\nTherefore before he arrives here in Attica, it is fitting that ye come\r\nto our rescue quickly in Boeotia.\" Thus the Athenians made answer, and\r\nupon that the envoys went away back to Sparta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO BOOK VIII\r\n\r\n1 [ See v. 77.]\r\n\r\n2 [ i.e. triremes.]\r\n\r\n3 [ {os to plethos ekastoi ton neon pareikhonto}: some read by\r\nconjecture {oson to plethos k.t.l.}]\r\n\r\n4 [ Perhaps \"also\" refers to the case of those who had come to\r\nThermopylai, cp. vii. 207: Others translate, \"these Hellenes who had\r\ncome after all to Artemision,\" i.e. after all the doubt and delay.]\r\n\r\n5 [ {pantes}: some MSS. have {plegentes}, which is adopted by most\r\nEditors, \"smitten by bribes.\"]\r\n\r\n6 [ {dethen}, with ironical sense.]\r\n\r\n7 [ {mede purphoron}: the {purphoros} had charge of the fire brought for\r\nsacrifices from the altar of Zeus Agetor at Sparta, and ordinarily his\r\nperson would be regarded as sacred; hence the proverb {oude purphoros\r\nesothe}, used of an utter defeat.]\r\n\r\n8 [ {tou diekploou}.]\r\n\r\n9 [ {kata stoma}.]\r\n\r\n10 [ {sklerai brontai}: the adjective means \"harsh-sounding.\"]\r\n\r\n11 [ {akhari}.]\r\n\r\n12 [ {ta Koila tes Euboies}.]\r\n\r\n13 [ \"having been roughly handled.\"]\r\n\r\n14 [ {epi ten thalassan tauten}: some MSS. read {taute} for {tauten},\r\nwhich is to be taken with {sullexas}, \"he assembled the generals\r\nthere.\"]\r\n\r\n15 [ {peripetea epoiesanto sphisi autoisi ta pregmata}.]\r\n\r\n16 [ {paleseie}, a word which does not occur elsewhere, and is explained\r\nby Hesychius as equivalent to {diaphtharein}.

THE NINTH BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED CALLIOPE\r\n\r\n1. Mardonios, when Alexander had returned back and had signified to him\r\nthat which was said by the Athenians, set forth from Thessaly and began\r\nto lead his army with all diligence towards Athens: and to whatever land\r\nhe came, he took up with him the people of that land. The leaders\r\nof Thessaly meanwhile did not repent of all that which had been done\r\nalready, but on the contrary they urged on the Persian yet much more;\r\nand Thorax of Larissa had joined in escorting Xerxes in his flight and\r\nat this time he openly offered Mardonios passage to invade Hellas..\r\n\r\n2. Then when the army in its march came to Boeotia, the Thebans\r\nendeavoured to detain Mardonios, and counselled him saying that there\r\nwas no region more convenient for him to have his encampment than that;\r\nand they urged him not to advance further, but to sit down there and\r\nendeavour to subdue to himself the whole of Hellas without fighting: for\r\nto overcome the Hellenes by open force when they were united, as at the\r\nformer time they were of one accord together, 1 was a difficult task\r\neven for the whole world combined, \"but,\" they proceeded, \"if thou wilt\r\ndo that which we advise, with little labour thou wilt have in thy power\r\nall their plans of resistance. 2 Send money to the men who have power in\r\ntheir cities, and thus sending thou wilt divide Hellas into two parties:\r\nafter that thou wilt with ease subdue by the help of thy party those who\r\nare not inclined to thy side.\".\r\n\r\n3. Thus they advised, but he did not follow their counsel; for there had\r\ninstilled itself into him a great desire to take Athens for the second\r\ntime, partly from obstinacy 3 and partly because he meant to signify to\r\nthe king in Sardis that he was in possession of Athens by beacon-fires\r\nthrough the islands. However he did not even at this time find the\r\nAthenians there when he came to Attica; but he was informed that the\r\ngreater number were either in Salamis or in the ships, and he captured\r\nthe city finding it deserted. Now the capture of the city by the king\r\nhad taken place ten months before the later expedition of Mardonios\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\n4. When Mardonios had come to Athens, he sent to Salamis Morychides\r\na man of the Hellespont, bearing the same proposals as Alexander the\r\nMacedonian had brought over to the Athenians. These he sent for the\r\nsecond time, being aware beforehand that the dispositions of the\r\nAthenians were not friendly, but hoping that they would give way and\r\nleave their obstinacy, since the Attic land had been captured by the\r\nenemy and was in his power..\r\n\r\n5. For this reason he sent Morychides to Salamis; and he came before\r\nthe Council 4 and reported the words of Mardonios. Then one of the\r\nCouncillors, Lykidas, expressed the opinion that it was better to\r\nreceive the proposal which Morychides brought before them and refer\r\nit to the assembly of the people. 5 He, I say, uttered this opinion,\r\nwhether because he had received money from Mardonios, or because this\r\nwas his own inclination: however the Athenians forthwith, both those\r\nof the Council and those outside, when they heard of it, were very\r\nindignant, and they came about Lykidas and stoned him to death; but\r\nthe Hellespontian Morychides they dismissed unhurt. Then when there had\r\narisen much uproar in Salamis about Lykidas, the women of the Athenians\r\nheard of that which was being done, and one woman passing the word to\r\nanother and one taking another with her, they went of their own accord\r\nto the house of Lykidas and stoned his wife and his children to death.\r\n\r\n6. The Athenians had passed over to Salamis as follows:—So long as they\r\nwere looking that an army should come from the Peloponnese to help them,\r\nthey remained in Attica; but as those in Peloponnesus acted very\r\nslowly and with much delay, while the invader was said to be already\r\nin Boeotia, they accordingly removed everything out of danger, and\r\nthemselves passed over to Salamis; and at the same time they sent envoys\r\nto Lacedemon to reproach the Lacedemonians for having permitted the\r\nBarbarian to invade Attica and for not having gone to Boeotia to meet\r\nhim in company with them, and also to remind them how many things\r\nthe Persian had promised to give the Athenians if they changed sides;\r\nbidding the envoys warn them that if they did not help the Athenians,\r\nthe Athenians would find some shelter 6 for themselves..\r\n\r\n7. For the Lacedemonians in fact were keeping a feast during this\r\ntime, and celebrating the Hyakinthia; and they held it of the greatest\r\nconsequence to provide for the things which concerned the god, while at\r\nthe same time their wall which they had been building at the Isthmus\r\nwas just at this moment being completed with battlements. And when the\r\nenvoys from the Athenians came to Lacedemon, bringing with them also\r\nenvoys from Megara and Plataia, they came in before the Ephors and said\r\nas follows: \"The Athenians sent us saying that the king of the Medes not\r\nonly offers to give us back our land, but also desires to make us his\r\nallies on fair and equal terms without deceit or treachery, 7 and\r\nis desirous moreover to give us another land in addition to our own,\r\nwhichsoever we shall ourselves choose. We however, having respect for\r\nZeus of the Hellenes and disdaining to be traitors to Hellas, did not\r\nagree but refused, although we were unjustly dealt with by the other\r\nHellenes and left to destruction, and although we knew that it was more\r\nprofitable to make a treaty with the Persian than to carry on war: nor\r\nshall we make a treaty at any future time, if we have our own will. Thus\r\nsincerely is our duty done towards the Hellenes: 8 but as for you, after\r\nhaving come then to great dread lest we should make a treaty with the\r\nPersian, so soon as ye learnt certainly what our spirit was, namely that\r\nwe should never betray Hellas, and because your wall across the Isthmus\r\nis all but finished, now ye make no account of the Athenians, but having\r\nagreed with us to come to Boeotia to oppose the Persian, ye have now\r\ndeserted us, and ye permitted the Barbarian moreover to make invasion of\r\nAttica. For the present then the Athenians have anger against you, for\r\nye did not do as was fitting to be done: and now they bid 9 you with all\r\nspeed send out an army together with us, in order that we may receive\r\nthe Barbarian in the land of Attica; for since we failed of Boeotia, the\r\nmost suitable place to fight in our land is the Thriasian plain.\".\r\n\r\n8. When the Ephors heard this they deferred their reply to the next day,\r\nand then on the next day to the succeeding one; and this they did even\r\nfor ten days, deferring the matter from day to day, while during this\r\ntime the whole body of the Peloponnesians were building the wall over\r\nthe Isthmus with great diligence and were just about to complete it.\r\nNow I am not able to say why, when Alexander the Macedonian had come\r\nto Athens, they were so very anxious lest the Athenians should take the\r\nside of the Medes, whereas now they had no care about it, except indeed\r\nthat their wall over the Isthmus had now been built, and they thought\r\nthey had no need of the Athenians any more; whereas when Alexander came\r\nto Attica the wall had not yet been completed, but they were working at\r\nit in great dread of the Persians..\r\n\r\n9. At last however the answer was given and the going forth of the\r\nSpartans took place in the following manner:—on the day before that\r\nwhich was appointed for the last hearing of the envoys, Chileos a man of\r\nTegea, who of all strangers had most influence in Lacedemon, heard from\r\nthe Ephors all that which the Athenians were saying; and he, it seems,\r\nsaid to them these words: \"Thus the matter stands, Ephors:—if the\r\nAthenians are not friendly with us but are allies of the Barbarian, then\r\nthough a strong wall may have been built across the Isthmus, yet a wide\r\ndoor has been opened for the Persian into Peloponnesus. Listen to their\r\nrequest, however, before the Athenians resolve upon something else\r\ntending to the fall of Hellas.\".\r\n\r\n10. Thus he counselled them, and they forthwith took his words to heart;\r\nand saying nothing to the envoys who had come from the cities, while\r\nyet it was night they sent out five thousand Spartans, with no less than\r\nseven of the Helots set to attend upon each man of them, 901 appointing\r\nPausanias the son of Cleombrotos to lead them forth. Now the leadership\r\nbelonged to Pleistarchos the son of Leonidas; but he was yet a boy, and\r\nthe other was his guardian and cousin: for Cleombrotos, the father of\r\nPausanias and son of Anaxandrides, was no longer alive, but when he had\r\nled home from the Isthmus the army which had built the wall, no long\r\ntime after this he died. Now the reason why Cleombrotos led home\r\nthe army from the Isthmus was this:—as he was offering sacrifice for\r\nfighting against the Persian, the sun was darkened in the heaven. And\r\nPausanias chose as commander in addition to himself Euryanax the son of\r\nDorieos, a man of the same house..\r\n\r\n11. So Pausanias with his army had gone forth out of Sparta; and the\r\nenvoys, when day had come, not knowing anything of this going forth,\r\ncame in before the Ephors meaning to depart also, each to his own State:\r\nand when they had come in before them they said these words: \"Ye, O\r\nLacedemonians, are remaining here and celebrating this Hyakinthia and\r\ndisporting yourselves, having left your allies to destruction; and the\r\nAthenians being wronged by you and for want of allies will make peace\r\nwith the Persians on such terms as they can: and having made peace,\r\nevidently we become allies of the king, and therefore we shall join with\r\nhim in expeditions against any land to which the Persians may lead us;\r\nand ye will learn then what shall be the issue for you of this matter.\"\r\nWhen the envoys spoke these words, the Ephors said and confirmed it with\r\nan oath, that they supposed by this time the men were at Orestheion on\r\ntheir way against the strangers: for they used to call the Barbarians\r\n\"strangers.\" 10 So they, not knowing of the matter, asked the meaning\r\nof these words, and asking they learnt all the truth; so that they were\r\nstruck with amazement and set forth as quickly as possible in pursuit;\r\nand together with them five thousand chosen hoplites of the Lacedemonian\r\n\"dwellers in the country round\" 11 did the same thing also.\r\n\r\n12. They then, I say, were hastening towards the Isthmus; and the\r\nArgives so soon as they heard that Pausanias with his army had gone\r\nforth from Sparta, sent as a herald to Attica the best whom they could\r\nfind of the long-distance runners, 12 because they had before of their\r\nown motion engaged for Mardonios that they would stop the Spartans from\r\ngoing forth: and the herald when he came to Athens spoke as follows:\r\n\"Mardonios, the Argives sent me to tell thee that the young men have\r\ngone forth from Lacedemon, and that the Argives are not able to stop\r\nthem from going forth: with regard to this therefore may it be thy\r\nfortune to take measures well.\" 13.\r\n\r\n13. He having spoken thus departed and went back; and Mardonios was\r\nby no means anxious any more to remain in Attica when he heard this\r\nmessage. Before he was informed of this he had been waiting, because he\r\ndesired to know the news from the Athenians as to what they were about\r\nto do; and he had not been injuring or laying waste the land of Attica,\r\nbecause he hoped always that they would make a treaty with him; but as\r\nhe did not persuade them, being now informed of everything he began to\r\nretire out of the country before the force of Pausanias arrived at the\r\nIsthmus, having first set fire to Athens and cast down and destroyed\r\nwhatever was left standing of the walls, houses or temples. Now he\r\nmarched away for this cause, namely first because Attica was not a\r\nland where horsemen could act freely, and also because, if he should be\r\ndefeated in a battle in Attica, there was no way of retreat except by a\r\nnarrow pass, so that a few men could stop them. He intended therefore\r\nto retreat to Thebes, and engage battle near to a friendly city and to a\r\ncountry where horsemen could act freely.\r\n\r\n14. Mardonios then was retiring out of the way, and when he was already\r\nupon a road a message came to him saying that another body of troops\r\nin advance of the rest 14 had come to Megara, consisting of a thousand\r\nLacedemonians. Being thus informed he took counsel with himself,\r\ndesiring if possible first to capture these. Therefore he turned back\r\nand proceeded to lead his army towards Megara, and the cavalry going in\r\nadvance of the rest overran the Megaran land: this was the furthest land\r\nin Europe towards the sun-setting to which this Persian army came..\r\n\r\n15. After this a message came to Mardonios that the Hellenes were\r\nassembled at the Isthmus; therefore he marched back by Dekeleia, for the\r\nchiefs of Boeotia 15 had sent for those of the Asopians who dwelt\r\nnear the line of march, and these were his guides along the road to\r\nSphendaleis and thence to Tanagra. So having encamped for the night at\r\nTanagra and on the next day having directed his march to Scolos, he was\r\nwithin the land of the Thebans. Then he proceeded to cut down the trees\r\nin the lands of the Thebans, although they were on the side of the\r\nMedes, moved not at all by enmity to them, but pressed by urgent\r\nnecessity both to make a defence for his camp, and also he was making it\r\nfor a refuge, in case that when he engaged battle things should not turn\r\nout for him as he desired. Now the encampment of his army extended\r\nfrom Erythrai along by Hysiai and reached the river Asopos: he was not\r\nhowever making the wall to extend so far as this, but with each face\r\nmeasuring somewhere about ten furlongs. 16\r\n\r\n16. While the Barbarians were engaged upon this work, Attaginos the son\r\nof Phyrnon, a Theban, having made magnificent preparations invited to\r\nan entertainment Mardonios himself and fifty of the Persians who were of\r\nmost account; and these being invited came; and the dinner was given at\r\nThebes. Now this which follows I heard from Thersander, an Orchomenian\r\nand a man of very high repute in Orchomenos. This Thersander said that\r\nhe too was invited by Attaginos to this dinner, and there were invited\r\nalso fifty men of the Thebans, and their host did not place them to\r\nrecline 17 separately each nation by themselves, but a Persian and\r\na Theban upon every couch. Then when dinner was over, as they were\r\ndrinking pledges to one another, 18 the Persian who shared a couch with\r\nhim speaking in the Hellenic tongue asked him of what place he was, and\r\nhe answered that he was of Orchomenos. The other said: \"Since now thou\r\nhast become my table-companion and the sharer of my libation, I desire\r\nto leave behind with thee a memorial of my opinion, in order that thou\r\nthyself also mayest know beforehand and be able to take such counsels\r\nfor thyself as may be profitable. Dost thou see these Persians who\r\nare feasting here, and the army which we left behind encamped upon the\r\nriver? Of all these, when a little time has gone by, thou shalt see but\r\nvery few surviving.\" While the Persian said these words he shed many\r\ntears, as Thersander reported; and he marvelling at his speech said\r\nto him: \"Surely then it is right to tell Mardonios and to those of the\r\nPersians who after him are held in regard.\" He upon this said: \"Friend,\r\nthat which is destined to come from God, it is impossible for a man to\r\navert; for no man is willing to follow counsel, even when one speaks\r\nthat which is reasonable. And these things which I say many of us\r\nPersians know well; yet we go with the rest being bound in the bonds of\r\nnecessity: and the most hateful grief of all human griefs is this,\r\nto have knowledge of the truth but no power over the event.\" 19 These\r\nthings I heard from Thersander of Orchomenos, and in addition to them\r\nthis also, namely that he told them to various persons forthwith, before\r\nthe battle took place at Plataia.\r\n\r\n17. Mardonios then being encamped in Boeotia, the rest of the Hellenes\r\nwho lived in these parts and took the side of the Medes were all\r\nsupplying troops and had joined in the invasion of Attica, but the\r\nPhokians alone had not joined in the invasion,—the Phokians, I say,\r\nfor these too were now actively 20 taking the side of the Medes, not of\r\ntheir own will however, but by compulsion. Not many days however after\r\nthe arrival of Mardonios at Thebes, there came of them a thousand\r\nhoplites, and their leader was Harmokydes, the man who was of most\r\nrepute among their citizens. When these too came to Thebes, Mardonios\r\nsent horsemen and bade the Phokians take up their position by themselves\r\nin the plain. After they had so done, forthwith the whole cavalry\r\nappeared; and upon this there went a rumour 21 through the army of\r\nHellenes which was with the Medes that the cavalry was about to shoot\r\nthem down with javelins, and this same report went through the Phokians\r\nthemselves also. Then their commander Harmokydes exhorted them, speaking\r\nas follows: \"Phokians, it is manifest that these men are meaning to\r\ndeliver us to a death which we may plainly foresee, 22 because we have\r\nbeen falsely accused by the Thessalians, as I conjecture: now therefore\r\nit is right that every one of you prove himself a good man; for it is\r\nbetter to bring our lives to an end doing deeds of valour and defending\r\nourselves, than to be destroyed by a dishonourable death offering\r\nourselves for the slaughter. Let each man of them learn that they\r\nare Barbarians and that we, against whom they contrived murder, are\r\nHellenes.\".\r\n\r\n18. While he was thus exhorting them, the horsemen having encompassed\r\nthem round were riding towards them as if to destroy them; and they were\r\nalready aiming their missiles as if about to discharge them, nay some\r\nperhaps did discharge them: and meanwhile the Phokians stood facing them\r\ngathered together and with their ranks closed as much as possible every\r\nway. Then the horsemen turned and rode away back. Now I am not able to\r\nsay for certain whether they came to destroy the Phokians at the request\r\nof the Thessalians, and then when they saw them turn to defence they\r\nfeared lest they also might suffer some loss, and therefore rode away\r\nback, for so Mardonios had commanded them; or whether on the other hand\r\nhe desired to make trial of them and to see if they had in them any\r\nwarlike spirit. Then, when the horsemen had ridden away back, Mardonios\r\nsent a herald and spoke to them as follows: \"Be of good courage,\r\nPhokians, for ye proved yourselves good men, and not as I was informed.\r\nNow therefore carry on this way with zeal, for ye will not surpass in\r\nbenefits either myself or the king.\" Thus far it happened as regards the\r\nPhokians.\r\n\r\n19. When the Lacedemonians came to the Isthmus they encamped upon it,\r\nand hearing this the rest of the Peloponnesians who favoured the better\r\ncause, and some also because they saw the Spartans going out, did not\r\nthink it right to be behind the Lacedemonians in their going forth.\r\nSo from the Isthmus, when the sacrifices had proved favourable,\r\nthey marched all together and came to Eleusis; and having performed\r\nsacrifices there also, when the signs were favourable they marched\r\nonwards, and the Athenians together with them, who had passed over\r\nfrom Salamis and had joined them at Eleusis. And then they had come to\r\nErythrai in Boeotia, then they learnt that the Barbarians were encamping\r\non the Asopos, and having perceived this they ranged themselves over\r\nagainst them on the lower slopes of Kithairon..\r\n\r\n20. Then Mardonios, as the Hellenes did not descend into the plain, sent\r\ntowards them all his cavalry, of which the commander was Masistios (by\r\nthe Hellenes called Makistios), a man of reputation among the Persians,\r\nwho had a Nesaian horse with a bridle of gold and in other respects\r\nfinely caparisoned. So when the horsemen had ridden up to the Hellenes\r\nthey attacked them by squadrons, and attacking 23 they did them much\r\nmischief, and moreover in contempt they called them women..\r\n\r\n21. Now it happened by chance that the Megarians were posted in the\r\nplace which was the most assailable of the whole position and to which\r\nthe cavalry could best approach: so as the cavalry were making\r\ntheir attacks, the Megarians being hard pressed sent a herald to the\r\ncommanders of the Hellenes, and the herald having come spoke these\r\nwords: \"The Megarians say:—we, O allies, are not able by ourselves to\r\nsustain the attacks of the Persian cavalry, keeping this position where\r\nwe took post at the first; nay, even hitherto by endurance and valour\r\nalone have we held out against them, hard pressed as we are: and now\r\nunless ye shall send some others to take up our position in succession\r\nto us, know that we shall leave the position in which we now are.\" The\r\nherald brought report to them thus; and upon this Pausanias made trial\r\nof the Hellenes, whether any others would voluntarily offer to go to\r\nthis place and post themselves there in succession to the Megarians: and\r\nwhen the rest were not desirous to go, the Athenians undertook the task,\r\nand of the Athenians those three hundred picked men of whom Olympidoros\r\nthe son of Lampon was captain.\r\n\r\n22. These they were who undertook the task and were posted at Erythrai\r\nin advance of the other Hellenes who ere there present, having chosen\r\nto go with them the bow-men also. For some time then they fought, and at\r\nlast an end was set to the fighting in the following manner:—while the\r\ncavalry was attacking by squadrons, the horse of Masistios, going in\r\nadvance of the rest, was struck in the side by an arrow, and feeling\r\npain he reared upright and threw Masistios off; and when he had fallen,\r\nthe Athenians forthwith pressed upon him; and his horse they took and\r\nhimself, as he made resistance, they slew, though at first they could\r\nnot, for his equipment was of this kind,—he wore a cuirass of gold\r\nscales underneath, and over the cuirass he had put on a crimson tunic.\r\nSo as they struck upon the cuirass they could effect nothing, until some\r\none, perceiving what the matter was, thrust into his eye. Then at length\r\nhe fell and died; and by some means the other men of the cavalry had not\r\nobserved this take place, for they neither saw him when he had fallen\r\nfrom his horse nor when he was being slain, and while the retreat\r\nand the turn 24 were being made, they did not perceive that which was\r\nhappening; but when they had stopped their horses, then at once they\r\nmissed him, since there was no one to command them; and when they\r\nperceived what had happened, they passed the word to one another and all\r\nrode together, that they might if possible recover the body..\r\n\r\n23. The Athenians upon that, seeing that the cavalry were riding to\r\nattack them no longer by squadrons but all together, shouted to the rest\r\nof the army to help them. Then while the whole number of those on foot\r\nwere coming to their help, there arose a sharp fight for the body; and\r\nso long as the three hundred were alone they had much the worse and were\r\nabout to abandon the body, but when the mass of the army came to their\r\nhelp, then the horsemen no longer sustained the fight, nor did they\r\nsucceed in recovering the body; and besides him they lost others of\r\ntheir number also. Then they drew off about two furlongs away and\r\ndeliberated what they should do; and it seemed good to them, as they had\r\nno commander, to ride back to Mardonios..\r\n\r\n24. When the cavalry arrived at the camp, the whole army and also\r\nMardonios made great mourning for Masistios, cutting off their own\r\nhair and that of their horses and baggage-animals and giving way to\r\nlamentation without stint; for all Boeotia was filled with the sound of\r\nit, because one had perished who after Mardonios was of the most account\r\nwith the Persians and with the king..\r\n\r\n25. The Barbarians then were paying honours in their own manner to\r\nMasistios slain: but the Hellenes, when they had sustained the attack of\r\nthe cavalry and having sustained it had driven them back, were much more\r\nencouraged; and first they put the dead body in a cart and conveyed it\r\nalong their ranks; and the body was a sight worth seeing for its size\r\nand beauty, wherefore also the men left their places in the ranks and\r\nwent one after the other 25 to gaze upon Masistios. After this they\r\nresolved to come down further towards Plataia; for the region of Plataia\r\nwas seen to be much more convenient for them to encamp in than that of\r\nErythrai, both for other reasons and because it is better watered. To\r\nthis region then and to the spring Gargaphia, which is in this region,\r\nthey resolved that they must come, and encamp in their several posts. So\r\nthey took up their arms and went by the lower slopes of Kithairon\r\npast Hysiai to the Plataian land; and having there arrived they posted\r\nthemselves according to their several nations near the spring Gargaphia\r\nand the sacred enclosure of Androcrates the hero, over low hills or\r\nlevel ground.\r\n\r\n26. Then in the arranging of the several posts there arose a contention\r\nof much argument 2501 between the Tegeans and the Athenians; for\r\nthey each claimed to occupy the other wing of the army 26 themselves,\r\nalleging deeds both new and old. The Tegeans on the one hand said as\r\nfollows: \"We have been always judged worthy of this post by the whole\r\nbody of allies in all the common expeditions which the Peloponnesians\r\nhave made before this, whether in old times or but lately, ever since\r\nthat time when the sons of Heracles endeavoured after the death of\r\nEurystheus to return to the Peloponnese. This honour we gained at that\r\ntime by reason of the following event:—When with the Achaians and the\r\nIonians who were then in Peloponnesus we had come out to the Isthmus to\r\ngive assistance and were encamped opposite those who desired to return,\r\nthen it is said that Hyllos made a speech saying that it was not right\r\nthat the one army should risk its safety by engaging battle with the\r\nother, and urging that that man of the army of the Peloponnesians whom\r\nthey should judge to be the best of them should fight in single combat\r\nwith himself on terms concerted between them. The Peloponnesians then\r\nresolved that this should be done; and they made oath with one another\r\non this condition,—that if Hyllos should conquer the leader of the\r\nPeloponnesians, then the sons of Heracles should return to their\r\nfather's heritage; but he should be conquered, then on the other hand\r\nthe sons of Heracles should depart and lead away their army, and not\r\nwithin a hundred years attempt to return to the Peloponnese. There was\r\nselected then of all the allies, he himself making a voluntary offer,\r\nEchemos the son of Aëropos, the son of Phegeus, 27 who was our commander\r\nand king: and he fought a single combat and slew Hyllos. By reason of\r\nthis deed we obtained among the Peloponnesians of that time, besides\r\nmany other great privileges which we still possess, this also of always\r\nleading the other wing of the army, when a common expedition is made.\r\nTo you, Lacedemonians, we make no opposition, but we give you freedom\r\nof choice, and allow you to command whichever wing ye desire; but of the\r\nother we say that it belongs to us to be the leaders as in former time:\r\nand apart from this deed which has been related, we are more worthy than\r\nthe Athenians to have this post; for in many glorious contests have\r\nwe contended against you, O Spartans, and in many also against others.\r\nTherefore it is just that we have the other wing rather than the\r\nAthenians; for they have not achieved deeds such as ours, either new or\r\nold.\".\r\n\r\n27. Thus they spoke, and the Athenians replied as follows: \"Though we\r\nknow that this gathering was assembled for battle with the Barbarian\r\nand not for speech, yet since the Tegean has proposed to us as a task\r\nto speak of things both old and new, the deeds of merit namely which by\r\neach of our two nations have been achieved in all time, it is necessary\r\nfor us to point out to you whence it comes that to us, who have been\r\nbrave men always, it belongs as a heritage rather than to the Arcadians\r\nto have the chief place. First as to the sons of Heracles, whose leader\r\nthey say that they slew at the Isthmus, these in the former time, when\r\nthey were driven away by all the Hellenes to whom they came flying from\r\nslavery under those of Mykene, we alone received; and joining with them\r\nwe subdued the insolence of Eurystheus, having conquered in fight\r\nthose who then dwelt in Peloponnesus. Again when the Argives who\r\nwith Polyneikes marched against Thebes, had been slain and were lying\r\nunburied, we declare that we marched an army against the Cadmeians\r\nand recovered the dead bodies and gave them burial in our own land at\r\nEleusis. We have moreover another glorious deed performed against\r\nthe Amazons who invaded once the Attic land, coming from the river\r\nThermodon: and in the toils of Troy we were not inferior to any. But it\r\nis of no profit to make mention of these things; for on the one hand,\r\nthough we were brave men in those times, we might now have become\r\nworthless, and on the other hand even though we were then worthless, yet\r\nnow we might be better. Let it suffice therefore about ancient deeds;\r\nbut if by us no other deed has been displayed (as many there have been\r\nand glorious, not less than by any other people of the Hellenes), yet\r\neven by reason of the deed wrought at Marathon alone we are worthy to\r\nhave this privilege and others besides this, seeing that we alone of\r\nall the Hellenes fought in single combat with the Persian, and having\r\nundertaken so great a deed we overcame and conquered six-and-forty\r\nnations. 28 Are we not worthy then to have this post by reason of that\r\ndeed alone? However, since at such a time as this it is not fitting to\r\ncontend for post, we are ready to follow your saying, O Lacedemonians,\r\nas to where ye think it most convenient that we should stand and\r\nopposite to whom; for wheresoever we are posted, we shall endeavour to\r\nbe brave men. Prescribe to us therefore and we shall obey.\" They made\r\nanswer thus; and the whole body of the Lacedemonians shouted aloud that\r\nthe Athenians were more worthy to occupy the wing than the Arcadians.\r\nThus the Athenians obtained the wing, and overcame the Tegeans.\r\n\r\n28. After this the Hellenes were ranged as follows, both those of them\r\nwho came in continually afterwards 29 and those who had come at the\r\nfirst. The right wing was held by ten thousand Lacedemonians; and of\r\nthese the five thousand who were Spartans were attended by thirty-five\r\nthousand Helots serving as light-armed troops, seven of them appointed\r\nfor each man. 30 To stand next to themselves the Spartans chose the\r\nTegeans, both to do them honour and also because of their valour; and\r\nof these there were one thousand five hundred hoplites. After these were\r\nstationed five thousand Corinthians, and they had obtained permission\r\nfrom Pausanias that the three hundred who were present of the men of\r\nPotidaia in Pallene should stand by their side. Next to these were\r\nstationed six hundred Arcadians of Orchomenos; and to these three\r\nthousand Sikyonians. Next after these were eight hundred Epidaurians:\r\nby the side of these were ranged a thousand Troizenians: next to the\r\nTroizenians two hundred Lepreates: next to these four hundred of the\r\nmen of Mikene and Tiryns; and then a thousand Phliasians. By the side of\r\nthese stood three hundred Hermionians; and next to the Hermionians were\r\nstationed six hundred Eretrians and Styrians; next to these four hundred\r\nChalkidians; and to these five hundred men of Amprakia. After these\r\nstood eight hundred Leucadians and Anactorians; and next to them two\r\nhundred from Pale in Kephallenia. After these were ranged five hundred\r\nEginetans; by their side three thousand Megarians; and next to these\r\nsix hundred Plataians. Last, or if you will first, were ranged the\r\nAthenians, occupying the left wing, eight thousand in number, and the\r\ncommander of them was Aristeides the son of Lysimachos..\r\n\r\n29. These all, excepting those who were appointed to attend the\r\nSpartans, seven for each man, were hoplites, being in number altogether\r\nthree myriads eight thousand and seven hundred. 31 This was the whole\r\nnumber of hoplites who were assembled against the Barbarian; and the\r\nnumber of the light-armed was as follows:—of the Spartan division\r\nthirty-five thousand men, reckoning at the rate of seven for each man,\r\nand of these every one was equipped for fighting; and the light-armed\r\ntroops of the rest of the Lacedemonians and of the other Hellenes, being\r\nabout one for each man, amounted to thirty-four thousand five hundred..\r\n\r\n30. Of the light-armed fighting men the whole number then was six\r\nmyriads nine thousand and five hundred; 32 and of the whole Hellenic\r\nforce which assembled at Plataia the number (including both the hoplites\r\nand the light-armed fighting men) was eleven myriads 33 all but one\r\nthousand eight hundred men; and with the Thespians who were present the\r\nnumber of eleven myriads was fully made up; for there were present also\r\nin the army those of the Thespians who survived, being in number about\r\none thousand eight hundred, and these too were without heavy arms.\r\n34 These then having been ranged in order were encamped on the river\r\nAsopos.\r\n\r\n31. Meanwhile the Barbarians with Mardonios, when they had sufficiently\r\nmourned for Masistios, being informed that the Hellenes were at Plataia\r\ncame themselves also to that part of the Asopos which flows there; and\r\nhaving arrived there, they were ranged against the enemy by Mardonios\r\nthus:—against the Lacedemonians he stationed the Persians; and since\r\nthe Persians were much superior in numbers, they were arrayed in deeper\r\nranks than those, and notwithstanding this they extended in front of the\r\nTegeans also: and he ranged them in this manner,—all the strongest part\r\nof that body he selected from the rest and stationed it opposite to the\r\nLacedemonians, but the weaker part he ranged by their side opposite\r\nto the Tegeans. This he did on the information and suggestion of the\r\nThebans. Then next to the Persians he ranged the Medes; and these\r\nextended in front of the Corinthians, Potidaians, Orchomenians and\r\nSikyonians. Next to the Medes he ranged the Bactrians; and these\r\nextended in front of the Epidaurians, Troizenians, Lepreates,\r\nTirynthians, Mykenians and Phliasians. After the Bactrians he stationed\r\nthe Indians; and these extended in front of the Hermionians, Eretrians,\r\nStyrians and Chalkidians. Next to the Indians he ranged the Sacans, who\r\nextended in front of the men of Amprakia, the Anactorians, Leucadians,\r\nPalians and Eginetans. Next to the Sacans and opposite to the Athenians,\r\nPlataians and Megarians, he ranged the Boeotians, Locrians, Malians,\r\nThessalians, and the thousand men of the Phokians: for not all the\r\nPhokians had taken the side of the Medes, but some of them were even\r\nsupporting the cause of the Hellenes, being shut up in Parnassos; and\r\nsetting out from thence they plundered from the army of Mardonios and\r\nfrom those of the Hellenes who were with him. He ranged the Macedonians\r\nalso and those who dwell about the borders of Thessaly opposite to the\r\nAthenians..\r\n\r\n32. These which have been named were the greatest of the nations who\r\nwere arrayed in order by Mardonios, those, I mean, which were the most\r\nrenowned and of greatest consideration: but there were in his army\r\nalso men of several other nations mingled together, of the Phrygians,\r\nThracians, Mysians, Paionians, and the rest; and among them also\r\nsome Ethiopians, and of the Egyptians those called Hermotybians and\r\nCalasirians, 35 carrying knives, 36 who of all the Egyptians are the\r\nonly warriors. These men, while he was yet at Phaleron, he had caused to\r\ndisembark from the ships in which they served as fighting-men; for the\r\nEgyptians had not been appointed to serve in the land-army which came\r\nwith Xerxes to Athens. Of the Barbarians then there were thirty myriads,\r\n37 as has been declared before; but of the Hellenes who were allies of\r\nMardonios no man knows what the number was, for they were not numbered;\r\nbut by conjecture I judge that these were assembled to the number of\r\nfive myriads. These who were placed in array side by side were on foot;\r\nand the cavalry was ranged apart from them in a separate body.\r\n\r\n33. When all had been drawn up by nations and by divisions, then on\r\nthe next day they offered sacrifice on both sides. For the Hellenes\r\nTisamenos the son of Antiochos was he who offered sacrifice, for he it\r\nwas who accompanied this army as diviner. This man the Lacedemonians had\r\nmade to be one of their own people, being an Eleian and of the race\r\nof the Iamidai: 38 for when Tisamenos was seeking divination at Delphi\r\nconcerning issue, the Pythian prophetess made answer to him that he\r\nshould win five of the greatest contests. He accordingly, missing the\r\nmeaning of the oracle, began to attend to athletic games, supposing\r\nthat he should win contests of athletics; and he practised for the\r\n\"five contests\" 39 and came within one fall of winning a victory at the\r\nOlympic games, 40 being set to contend with Hieronymos of Andros. The\r\nLacedemonians however perceived that the oracle given to Tisamenos had\r\nreference not to athletic but to martial contests, and they endeavoured\r\nto persuade Tisamenos by payment of money, and to make him a leader in\r\ntheir wars together with the kings of the race of Heracles. He then,\r\nseeing that the Spartans set much store on gaining him over as a friend,\r\nhaving perceived this, I say, he raised his price and signified to them\r\nthat he would do as they desired, if they would make him a citizen of\r\ntheir State and give him full rights, but for no other payment. The\r\nSpartans at first when they heard this displayed indignation and\r\naltogether gave up their request, but at last, when great terror\r\nwas hanging over them of this Persian armament, they gave way 41 and\r\nconsented. He then perceiving that they had changed their minds, said\r\nthat he could not now be satisfied even so, nor with these terms alone;\r\nbut it was necessary that his brother Hegias also should be made a\r\nSpartan citizen on the same terms as he himself became one..\r\n\r\n34. By saying this he followed the example of Melampus in his request,\r\n42 if one may compare royal power with mere citizenship; for Melampus\r\non his part, when the women in Argos had been seized by madness, and the\r\nArgives endeavoured to hire him to come from Pylos and to cause their\r\nwomen to cease from the malady, proposed as payment for himself the half\r\nof the royal power; and the Argives did not suffer this, but departed:\r\nand afterwards, when more of their women became mad, at length they\r\naccepted that which Melampus had proposed, and went to offer him this:\r\nbut he then seeing that they had changed their minds, increased his\r\ndemand, and said that he would not do that which they desired unless\r\nthey gave to his brother Bias also the third share in the royal power.\r\n43 And the Argives, being driven into straits, consented to this also.\r\n35. Just so the Spartans also, being very much in need of Tisamenos,\r\nagreed with him on any terms which he desired: and when the Spartans had\r\nagreed to this demand also, then Tisamenos the Eleian, having become a\r\nSpartan, had part with them in winning five of the greatest contests\r\nas their diviner: and these were the only men who ever were made\r\nfellow-citizens of the Spartans. Now the five contests were these: one\r\nand the first of them was this at Plataia; and after this the contest at\r\nTegea, which took place with the Tegeans and the Argives; then that at\r\nDipaieis against all the Arcadians except the Mantineians; after that\r\nthe contest with the Messenians at Ithome; 44 and last of all that which\r\ntook place at Tanagra against the Athenians and Argives. This, I say,\r\nwas accomplished last of the five contests.\r\n\r\n36. This Tisamenos was acting now as diviner for the Hellenes in the\r\nPlataian land, being brought by the Spartans. Now to the Hellenes the\r\nsacrifices were of good omen if they defended themselves only, but not\r\nif they crossed the Asopos and began a battle;.\r\n\r\n37, and Mardonios too, who was eager to begin a battle, found the\r\nsacrifices not favourable to this design, but they were of good omen\r\nto him also if he defended himself only; for he too used the Hellenic\r\nmanner of sacrifice, having as diviner Hegesistratos an Eleian and the\r\nmost famous of the Telliadai, whom before these events the Spartans had\r\ntaken and bound, in order to put him to death, because they had suffered\r\nmuch mischief from him. He then being in this evil case, seeing that he\r\nwas running a course for his life and was likely moreover to suffer\r\nmuch torment before his death, had done a deed such as may hardly be\r\nbelieved. Being made fast on a block bound with iron, he obtained\r\nan iron tool, which in some way had been brought in, and contrived\r\nforthwith a deed the most courageous of any that we know: for having\r\nfirst calculated how the remaining portion of his foot might be got out\r\nof the block, he cut away the flat of his own foot, 45 and after that,\r\nsince he was guarded still by warders, he broke through the wall and\r\nso ran away to Tegea, travelling during the nights and in the daytime\r\nentering a wood and resting there; so that, though the Lacedemonians\r\nsearched for him in full force, he arrived at Tegea on the third\r\nnight; and the Lacedemonians were possessed by great wonder both at\r\nhis courage, when they saw the piece of the foot that was cut off lying\r\nthere, and also because they were not able to find him. So he at that\r\ntime having thus escaped them took refuge at Tegea, which then was not\r\nfriendly with the Lacedemonians; and when he was healed and had procured\r\nfor himself a wooden foot, he became an open enemy of the Lacedemonians.\r\nHowever in the end the enmity into which he had fallen with the\r\nLacedemonians was not to his advantage; for he was caught by them while\r\npractising divination in Zakynthos, and was put to death.\r\n\r\n38. However the death of Hegesistratos took place later than the\r\nevents at Plataia, and he was now at the Asopos, having been hired by\r\nMardonions for no mean sum, sacrificing and displaying zeal for his\r\ncause both on account of his enmity with the Lacedemonians and on\r\naccount of the gain which he got: but as the sacrifices were not\r\nfavourable for a battle either for the Persians themselves or for\r\nthose Hellenes who were with them (for these also had a diviner for\r\nthemselves, Hippomachos a Leucadian), and as the Hellenes had men\r\nconstantly flowing in and were becoming more in number, Timagenides the\r\nson of Herpys, a Theban, counselled Mardonios to set a guard on the pass\r\nof Kithairon, saying that the Hellenes were constantly flowing in every\r\nday and that he would thus cut off large numbers..\r\n\r\n39. Eight days had now passed while they had been sitting opposite to\r\none another, when he gave this counsel to Mardonios; and Mardonios,\r\nperceiving that the advice was good, sent the cavalry when night came\r\non to the pass of Kithairon leading towards Plataia, which the Boeotians\r\ncall the \"Three Heads\" 46 and the Athenians the \"Oak Heads.\" 47 Having\r\nbeen thus sent, the cavalry did not come without effect, for they caught\r\nfive hundred baggage-animals coming out into the plain, which were\r\nbearing provisions from Peloponnesus to the army, and also the men\r\nwho accompanied the carts: and having taken this prize the Persians\r\nproceeded to slaughter them without sparing either beast or man; and\r\nwhen they were satiated with killing they surrounded the rest and drove\r\nthem into the camp to Mardonios.\r\n\r\n40. After this deed they spent two days more, neither side wishing to\r\nbegin a battle; for the Barbarians advanced as far as the Asopos to make\r\ntrial of the Hellenes, but neither side would cross the river. However\r\nthe cavalry of Mardonios made attacks continually and did damage to the\r\nHellenes; for the Thebans, being very strong on the side of the Medes,\r\ncarried on the war with vigour, and always directed them up to the\r\nmoment of fighting; and after this the Persians and Medes took up the\r\nwork and were they who displayed valour in their turn.\r\n\r\n41. For ten days then nothing more was done than this; but when the\r\neleventh day had come, while they still sat opposite to one another at\r\nPlataia, the Hellenes having by this time grown much more numerous and\r\nMardonios being greatly vexed at the delay of action, then Mardonios the\r\nson of Gobryas and Artabazos the son of Pharnakes, who was esteemed\r\nby Xerxes as few of the Persians were besides, came to speech with\r\none another; and as they conferred, the opinions they expressed were\r\nthese,—that of Artabazos, that they must put the whole army in motion\r\nas soon as possible and go to the walls of the Thebans, whither great\r\nstores of corn had been brought in for them and fodder for their beasts;\r\nand that they should settle there quietly and get their business done\r\nas follows:—they had, he said, great quantities of gold, both coined and\r\nuncoined, and also of silver and of drinking-cups; and these he advised\r\nthey should send about to the Hellenes without stint, more especially\r\nto those of the Hellenes who were leaders in their several cities; and\r\nthese, he said, would speedily deliver up their freedom: and he advised\r\nthat they should not run the risk of a battle. His opinion then was the\r\nsame as that of the Thebans, 48 for he as well as they had some true\r\nforesight: but the opinion of Mardonios was more vehement and more\r\nobstinate, and he was by no means disposed to yield; for he said that he\r\nthought their army far superior to that of the Hellenes, and he gave as\r\nhis opinion that they should engage battle as quickly as possible and\r\nnot allow them to assemble in still greater numbers than were already\r\nassembled; and as for the sacrifices of Hegesistratos, they should leave\r\nthem alone and not endeavour to force a good sign, but follow the custom\r\nof the Persians and engage battle..\r\n\r\n42. When he so expressed his judgment, none opposed him, and thus his\r\nopinion prevailed; for he and not Artabazos had the command of the\r\narmy given him by the king. He summoned therefore the commanders of\r\nthe divisions and the generals of those Hellenes who were with him, and\r\nasked whether they knew of any oracle regarding the Persians, which\r\nsaid that they should be destroyed in Hellas; and when those summoned to\r\ncouncil 49 were silent, some not knowing the oracles and others knowing\r\nthem but not esteeming it safe to speak, Mardonios himself said: \"Since\r\nthen ye either know nothing or do not venture to speak, I will tell you,\r\nsince I know very well. There is an oracle saying that the Persians are\r\ndestined when they come to Hellas to plunder the temple at Delphi, and\r\nhaving plundered it to perish every one of them. We therefore, just\r\nbecause we know this, will not go to that temple nor will we attempt\r\nto plunder it; and for this cause we shall not perish. So many of you\r\ntherefore as chance to wish well to the Persians, have joy so far\r\nas regards this matter, and be assured that we shall overcome the\r\nHellenes.\" Having spoken to them thus, he next commanded to prepare\r\neverything and to set all in order, since at dawn of the next day a\r\nbattle would be fought.\r\n\r\n43. Now this oracle, which Mardonios said referred to the Persians, I\r\nknow for my part was composed with reference with the Illyrians and the\r\narmy of the Enchelians, and not with reference to the Persians at all.\r\nHowever, the oracle which was composed by Bakis with reference to this\r\nbattle,\r\n\r\n\r\n \"The gathering of Hellenes together and cry of Barbarian voices,\r\n  Where the Thermodon flows, by the banks of grassy Asopos;\r\n  Here very many shall fall ere destiny gave them to perish,\r\n  Medes bow-bearing in fight, when the fatal day shall approach them,\"—\r\n\r\nthese sayings, and others like them composed by Musaios, I know had\r\nreference to the Persians. Now the river Thermodon flows between Tanagra\r\nand Glisas.\r\n\r\n44. After the inquiry about the oracles and the exhortation given by\r\nMardonios night came on and the guards were set: and when night was far\r\nadvanced, and it seemed that there was quiet everywhere in the camps,\r\nand that the men were in their deepest sleep, then Alexander the son of\r\nAmyntas, commander and king of the Macedonians, rode his horse up to\r\nthe guard-posts of the Athenians and requested that he might have speech\r\nwith their generals. So while the greater number of the guards stayed at\r\ntheir posts, some ran to the generals, and when they reached them they\r\nsaid that a man had come riding on a horse out of the camp of the Medes,\r\nwho discovered nothing further, but only named the generals and said\r\nthat he desired to have speech with them..\r\n\r\n45. Having heard this, forthwith they accompanied the men to the\r\nguard-posts, and when they had arrived there, Alexander thus spoke\r\nto them: \"Athenians, I lay up these words of mine as a trust to you,\r\ncharging you to keep them secret and tell them to no one except only to\r\nPausanias, lest ye bring me to ruin: for I should not utter them if I\r\ndid not care greatly for the general safety of Hellas, seeing that I am\r\na Hellene myself by original descent and I should not wish to see Hellas\r\nenslaved instead of free. I say then that Mardonios and his army cannot\r\nget the offerings to be according to their mind, 50 for otherwise ye\r\nwould long ago have fought. Now however he has resolved to let the\r\nofferings alone and to bring on a battle at dawn of day; for, as\r\nI conjecture, he fears lest ye should assemble in greater numbers.\r\nTherefore prepare yourselves; and if after all Mardonios should put\r\noff the battle and not bring it on, stay where ye are and hold out\r\npatiently; for they have provisions only for a few days remaining. And\r\nif this way shall have its issue according to your mind, then each one\r\nof you ought to remember me also concerning liberation, 51 since I have\r\ndone for the sake of the Hellenes so hazardous a deed by reason of my\r\nzeal for you, desiring to show you the design of Mardonios, in order\r\nthat the Barbarians may not fall upon you when ye are not as yet\r\nexpecting them: and I am Alexander the Macedonian.\" Thus having spoken\r\nhe rode away back to the camp and to his own position.\r\n\r\n46. Then the generals of the Athenians came to the right wing and told\r\nPausanias that which they had heard from Alexander. Upon this saying he\r\nbeing struck with fear of the Persians spoke as follows: \"Since then at\r\ndawn the battle comes on, it is right that ye, Athenians, should take\r\nyour stand opposite to the Persians, and we opposite to the Boeotians\r\nand those Hellenes who are now posted against you; and for this reason,\r\nnamely because ye are acquainted with the Medes and with their manner\r\nof fighting, having fought with them at Marathon, whereas we have had no\r\nexperience of these men and are without knowledge of them; for not\r\none of the Spartans has made trial of the Medes in fight, but of the\r\nBoeotians and Thessalians we have had experience. It is right therefore\r\nthat ye should take up your arms and come to this wing of the army, and\r\nthat we should go to the left wing.\" In answer to this the Athenians\r\nspoke as follows: \"To ourselves also long ago at the very first, when we\r\nsaw that the Persians were being ranged opposite to you, it occurred to\r\nus to say these very things, which ye now bring forward before we have\r\nuttered them; but we feared lest these words might not be pleasing to\r\nyou. Since however ye yourselves have made mention of this, know that\r\nyour words have caused us pleasure, and that we are ready to do this\r\nwhich ye say.\".\r\n\r\n47. Both then were content to do this, and as dawn appeared they began\r\nto change their positions with one another: and the Boeotians perceiving\r\nthat which was being done reported it to Mardonios, who, when he heard\r\nit, forthwith himself also endeavoured to change positions, bringing the\r\nPersians along so as to be against the Lacedemonians: and when\r\nPausanias learnt that this was being done, he perceived that he was not\r\nunobserved, and he led the Spartans back again to the right wing; and\r\njust so also did Mardonios upon his left.\r\n\r\n48. When they had been thus brought to their former positions, Mardonios\r\nsent a herald to the Spartans and said as follows: \"Lacedemonians, ye\r\nare said forsooth by those who are here to be very good men, and they\r\nhave admiration for you because ye do not flee in war nor leave\r\nyour post, but stay there and either destroy your enemies or perish\r\nyourselves. In this however, as it now appears, there is no truth; for\r\nbefore we engaged battle and came to hand-to-hand conflict we saw you\r\nalready flee and leave your station, desiring to make the trial with\r\nthe Athenians first, while ye ranged yourselves opposite to our slaves.\r\nThese are not at all the deeds of good men in war, but we were deceived\r\nin you very greatly; for we expected by reason of your renown that ye\r\nwould send a herald to us, challenging us and desiring to fight with the\r\nPersians alone; but though we on our part were ready to do this, we did\r\nnot find that ye said anything of this kind, but rather that ye cowered\r\nwith fear. Now therefore since ye were not the first to say this, we\r\nare the first. Why do we not forthwith fight, 52 ye on behalf of the\r\nHellenes, since ye have the reputation of being the best, and we on\r\nbehalf of the Barbarians, with equal numbers on both sides? and if we\r\nthink it good that the others should fight also, then let them fight\r\nafterwards; and if on the other hand we should not think it good, but\r\nthink it sufficient that we alone should fight, then let us fight it\r\nout to the end, and whichsoever of us shall be the victors, let these be\r\ncounted as victorious with their whole army.\".\r\n\r\n49. The herald having thus spoken waited for some time, and then, as no\r\none made him any answer, he departed and went back; and having returned\r\nhe signified to Mardonios that which had happened to him. Mardonios\r\nthen being greatly rejoiced and elated by his empty 53 victory, sent\r\nthe cavalry to attack the Hellenes: and when the horsemen had ridden\r\nto attack them, they did damage to the whole army of the Hellenes by\r\nhurling javelins against them and shooting with bows, being mounted\r\narchers and hard therefore to fight against: and they disturbed and\r\nchoked up the spring Gargaphia, from which the whole army of the\r\nHellenes was drawing its water. Now the Lacedemonians alone were posted\r\nnear this spring, and it was at some distance from the rest of the\r\nHellenes, according as they chanced to be posted, while the Asopos was\r\nnear at hand; but when they were kept away from the Asopos, then they\r\nused to go backwards and forwards to this spring; for they were not\r\npermitted by the horsemen and archers to fetch water from the river..\r\n\r\n50. Such then being the condition of things, the generals of the\r\nHellenes, since the army had been cut off from its water and was being\r\nharassed by the cavalry, assembled to consult about these and other\r\nthings, coming to Pausanias upon the right wing: for other things too\r\ntroubled them yet more than these of which we have spoken, since they\r\nno longer had provisions, and their attendants who had been sent to\r\nPeloponnese for the purpose of getting them had been cut off by the\r\ncavalry and were not able to reach the camp..\r\n\r\n51. It was resolved then by the generals in council with one another,\r\nthat if the Persians put off the battle for that day, they would go\r\nto the Island. This is distant ten furlongs 54 from the Asopos and the\r\nspring Gargaphia, where they were then encamped, and is in front of the\r\ncity of the Plataians: and if it be asked how there can be an island on\r\nthe mainland, thus it is 55:—the river parts in two above, as it flows\r\nfrom Kithairon down to the plain, keeping a distance of about three\r\nfurlongs between its streams, and after that it joins again in one\r\nstream; and the name of it is Oëroe, said by the natives of the country\r\nto be the daughter of Asopos. To this place of which I speak they\r\ndetermined to remove, in order that they might be able to get an\r\nabundant supply of water and that the cavalry might not do them damage,\r\nas now when they were right opposite. And they proposed to remove when\r\nthe second watch of the night should have come, so that the Persians\r\nmight not see them set forth and harass them with the cavalry pursuing.\r\nThey proposed also, after they had arrived at this place, round which,\r\nas I say, Oëroe the daughter of Asopos flows, parting into two streams\r\n56 as she runs from Kithairon, to send half the army to Kithairon during\r\nthis same night, in order to take up their attendants who had gone to\r\nget the supplies of provisions; for these were cut off from them in\r\nKithairon.\r\n\r\n52. Having thus resolved, during the whole of that day they had trouble\r\nunceasingly, while the cavalry pressed upon them; but when the day drew\r\nto a close and the attacks of the cavalry had ceased, then as it was\r\nbecoming night and the time had arrived at which it had been agreed\r\nthat they should retire from their place, the greater number of them set\r\nforth and began to retire, not however keeping it in mind to go to the\r\nplace which had been agreed upon; but on the contrary, when they had\r\nbegun to move, they readily took occasion to flee 57 from the cavalry\r\ntowards the city of the Plataians, and in their flight they came as\r\nfar as the temple of Hera, which temple is in front of the city of the\r\nPlataians at a distance of twenty furlongs from the spring Gargaphia;\r\nand when they had there arrived they halted in front of the temple.\r\n\r\n53. These then were encamping about the temple of Hera; and Pausanias,\r\nseeing that they were retiring from the camp, gave the word to the\r\nLacedemonians also to take up their arms and go after the others who\r\nwere preceding them, supposing that these were going to the place to\r\nwhich they had agreed to go. Then, when all the other commanders were\r\nready to obey Pausanias, Amompharetos the son of Poliades, the commander\r\nof the Pitanate division, 58 said that he would not flee from the\r\nstrangers, nor with his own will would he disgrace Sparta; and he\r\nexpressed wonder at seeing that which was being done, not having been\r\npresent at the former discussion. And Pausanias and Euryanax were\r\ngreatly disturbed that he did not obey them and still more that they\r\nshould be compelled to leave the Pitanate division behind, since he thus\r\nrefused; 59 for they feared that if they should leave it in order to do\r\nthat which they had agreed with the other Hellenes, both Amompharetos\r\nhimself would perish being left behind and also the men with him. With\r\nthis thought they kept the Lacedemonian force from moving, and meanwhile\r\nthey endeavoured to persuade him that it was not right for him to do\r\nso..\r\n\r\n54. They then were exhorting Amompharetos, who had been left behind\r\nalone of the Lacedemonians and Tegeans; and meanwhile the Athenians\r\nwere keeping themselves quiet in the place where they had been posted,\r\nknowing the spirit of the Lacedemonians, that they were apt to say\r\notherwise than they really meant; 60 and when the army began to move,\r\nthey sent a horseman from their own body to see whether the Spartans\r\nwere attempting to set forth, or whether they had in truth no design at\r\nall to retire; and they bade him ask Pausanias what they ought to do.\r\n55. So when the herald came to the Lacedemonians, he saw that they were\r\nstill in their place and that the chiefs of them had come to strife with\r\none another: for when Euryanax and Pausanias both exhorted Amompharetos\r\nnot to run the risk of remaining behind with his men, alone of all the\r\nLacedemonians, they did not at all persuade him, and at last they had\r\ncome to downright strife; and meanwhile the herald of the Athenians had\r\narrived and was standing by them. And Amompharetos in his contention\r\ntook a piece of rock in both his hands and placed it at the feet of\r\nPausanias, saying that with this pebble he gave his vote not to fly from\r\nthe strangers, meaning the Barbarians. 61 Pausanias then, calling him a\r\nmadman and one who was not in his right senses, bade tell the state of\r\ntheir affairs to the Athenian herald, 62 who was asking that which he\r\nhad been charged to ask; and at the same time he requested the Athenians\r\nto come towards the Lacedemonians and to do in regard to the retreat the\r\nsame as they did..\r\n\r\n56. He then went away back to the Athenians; and as the dawn of day\r\nfound them yet disputing with one another, Pausanias, who had remained\r\nstill throughout all this time, gave the signal, and led away all the\r\nrest over the low hills, supposing that Amonpharetos would not stay\r\nbehind when the other Lacedemonians departed (in which he was in fact\r\nright); and with them also went the Tegeans. Meanwhile the Athenians,\r\nfollowing the commands which were given them, were going in the\r\ndirection opposite to that of the Lacedemonians; for these were clinging\r\nto the hills and the lower slope of Kithairon from fear of the cavalry,\r\nwhile the Athenians were marching below in the direction of the plain..\r\n\r\n57. As for Amonpharetos, he did not at first believe that Pausanias\r\nwould ever venture to leave him and his men behind, and he stuck to it\r\nthat they should stay there and not leave their post; but when Pausanias\r\nand his troops were well in front, then he perceived that they had\r\nactually left him behind, and he made his division take up their arms\r\nand led them slowly towards the main body. This, when it had got away\r\nabout ten furlongs, stayed for the division of Amompharetos, halting\r\nat the river Moloeis and the place called Argiopion, where also there\r\nstands a temple of the Eleusinian Demeter: and it stayed there for this\r\nreason, namely in order that of Amonpharetos and his division should not\r\nleave the place where they had been posted, but should remain there, it\r\nmight be able to come back to their assistance. So Amompharetos and his\r\nmen were coming up to join them, and the cavalry also of the Barbarians\r\nwas at the same time beginning to attack them in full force: for the\r\nhorsemen did on this day as they had been wont to do every day; and\r\nseeing the place vacant in which the Hellenes had been posted on the\r\nformer days, they rode their horses on continually further, and as soon\r\nas they came up with them they began to attack them.\r\n\r\n58. Then Mardonios, when he was informed that the Hellenes had departed\r\nduring the night, and when he saw their place deserted, called Thorax of\r\nLarissa and his brothers Eurypylos and Thrasydeios, and said: \"Sons\r\nof Aleuas, will ye yet say anything, 63 now that ye see these places\r\ndeserted? For ye who dwell near them were wont to say that the\r\nLacedemonians did not fly from a battle, but were men unsurpassed in\r\nwar; and these men ye not only saw before this changing from their post,\r\nbut now we all of us see that they have run away during the past night;\r\nand by this they showed clearly, when the time came for them to contend\r\nin battle with those who were in truth the best of all men, that after\r\nall they were men of no worth, who had been making a display of valour\r\namong Hellenes, a worthless race. As for you, since ye had had no\r\nexperience of the Persians, I for my part was very ready to excuse you\r\nwhen ye praised these, of whom after all ye knew something good; but\r\nmuch more I marvelled at Artabazos that he should have been afraid of\r\nthe Lacedemonians, and that having been afraid he should have uttered\r\nthat most cowardly opinion, namely that we ought to move our army away\r\nand go to the city of the Thebans to be besieged there,—an opinion about\r\nwhich the king shall yet be informed by me. Of these things we will\r\nspeak in another place; now however we must not allow them to act thus,\r\nbut we must pursue them until they are caught and pay the penalty to us\r\nfor all that they did to the Persians in time past.\".\r\n\r\n59. Thus having spoken he led on the Persians at a run, after they had\r\ncrossed the Asopos, on the track of the Hellenes, supposing that\r\nthese were running away from him; and he directed his attack upon the\r\nLacedemonians and Tegeans only, for the Athenians, whose march was\r\ntowards the plain, he did not see by reason of the hills. Then the rest\r\nof the commanders of the Barbarian divisions, seeing that the Persians\r\nhad started to pursue the Hellenes, forthwith all raised the signals for\r\nbattle and began to pursue, each as fast as they could, not arranged in\r\nany order or succession of post..\r\n\r\n60. These then were coming on with shouting and confused numbers,\r\nthinking to make short work of 64 the Hellenes; and Pausanias, when the\r\ncavalry began to attack, sent to the Athenians a horseman and said thus:\r\n\"Athenians, now that the greatest contest is set before us, namely that\r\nwhich has for its issue the freedom or the slavery of Hellas, we have\r\nbeen deserted by our allies, we Lacedemonians and ye Athenians, seeing\r\nthat they have run away during the night that is past. Now therefore\r\nit is determined what we must do upon this, namely that we must defend\r\nourselves and protect one another as best we may. If then the cavalry\r\nhad set forth to attack you at the first, we and the Tegeans, who with\r\nus refuse to betray the cause of Hellas, should have been bound to go to\r\nyour help; but as it is, since the whole body has come against us, it is\r\nright that ye should come to that portion of the army which is hardest\r\npressed, to give aid. If however anything has happened to you which\r\nmakes it impossible for you to come to our help, then do us a kindness\r\nby sending to us the archers; and we know that ye have been in the\r\ncourse of this present war by far the most zealous of all, so that ye\r\nwill listen to our request in this matter also.\".\r\n\r\n61. When the Athenians heard this they were desirous to come to their\r\nhelp and to assist them as much as possible; and as they were already\r\ngoing, they were attacked by those of the Hellenes on the side of the\r\nking who had been ranged opposite to them, so that they were no longer\r\nable to come to the help of the Lacedemonians, for the force that\r\nwas attacking them gave them much trouble. Thus the Lacedemonians and\r\nTegeans were left alone, being in number, together with light-armed men,\r\nthe former fifty thousand and the Tegeans three thousand; for these\r\nwere not parted at all from the Lacedemonians: and they began to offer\r\nsacrifice, meaning to engage battle with Mardonios and the force\r\nwhich had come against them. Then since their offerings did not prove\r\nfavourable, and many of them were being slain during this time and many\r\nmore wounded,—for the Persians had made a palisade of their wicker-work\r\nshields 65 and were discharging their arrows in great multitude and\r\nwithout sparing,—Pausanias, seeing that the Spartans were hard pressed\r\nand that the offerings did not prove favourable, fixed his gaze upon\r\nthe temple of Hera of the Plataians and called upon the goddess to help,\r\npraying that they might by no means be cheated of their hope:.\r\n\r\n62, and while he was yet calling upon her thus, the Tegeans started\r\nforward before them and advanced against the Barbarians, and forthwith\r\nafter the prayer of Pausanias the offerings proved favourable for the\r\nLacedemonians as they sacrificed. So when this at length came to pass,\r\nthen they also advanced against the Persians; and the Persians put away\r\ntheir bows and came against them. Then first there was fighting about\r\nthe wicker-work shields, and when these had been overturned, after that\r\nthe fighting was fierce by the side of the temple of Demeter, and so\r\ncontinued for a long time, until at last they came to justling; for\r\nthe Barbarians would take hold of the spears and break them off. Now in\r\ncourage and in strength the Persians were not inferior to the others,\r\nbut they were without defensive armour, 66 and moreover they were\r\nunversed in war and unequal to their opponents in skill; and they would\r\ndart out one at a time or in groups of about ten together, some more and\r\nsome less, and fall upon the Spartans and perish..\r\n\r\n63. In the place where Mardonios himself was, riding on a white horse\r\nand having about him the thousand best men of the Persians chosen out\r\nfrom the rest, here, I say, they pressed upon their opponents most of\r\nall: and so long as Mardonios survived, they held out against them, and\r\ndefending themselves they cast down many of the Lacedemonians; but when\r\nMardonios was slain and the men who were ranged about his person, which\r\nwas the strongest portion of the whole army, had fallen, then the others\r\ntoo turned and gave way before the Lacedemonians; for their manner of\r\ndress, without defensive armour, was a very great cause of destruction\r\nto them, since in truth they were contending light-armed against\r\nhoplites..\r\n\r\n64. Then the satisfaction for the murder of Leonidas was paid by\r\nMardonios according to the oracle given to the Spartans, 67 and the most\r\nfamous victory of all those about which we have knowledge was gained\r\nby Pausanias the son of Cleombrotos, the son of Anaxandrides; of his\r\nancestors above this the names have been given for Leonidas, 68 since,\r\nas it happens, they are the same for both. Now Mardonios was slain by\r\nArimnestos, 69 a man of consideration in Sparta, who afterwards, when\r\nthe Median wars were over, with three hundred men fought a battle\r\nagainst the whole army of the Messenians, then at war with the\r\nLacedemonians, at Stenycleros, and both he was slain and also the three\r\nhundred..\r\n\r\n65. When the Persians were turned to flight at Plataia by the\r\nLacedemonians, they fled in disorder to their own camp and to the\r\npalisade which they had made in the Theban territory: 70 and it is a\r\nmarvel to me that, whereas they fought by the side of the sacred grove\r\nof Demeter, not one of the Persians was found to have entered the\r\nenclosure or to have been slain within it, but round about the temple in\r\nthe unconsecrated ground fell the greater number of the slain. I suppose\r\n(if one ought to suppose anything about divine things) that the goddess\r\nherself refused to receive them, because they had set fire to the\r\ntemple, that is to say the \"palace\" 71 at Eleusis.\r\n\r\n66. Thus far then had this battle proceeded: but Artabazos the son\r\nof Pharnakes had been displeased at the very first because Mardonios\r\nremained behind after the king was gone; and afterwards he had been\r\nbringing forward objections continually and doing nothing, but had urged\r\nthem always not to fight a battle: and for himself he acted as\r\nfollows, not being pleased with the things which were being done by\r\nMardonios.—The men of whom Artabazos was commander (and he had with him\r\nno small force but one which was in number as much as four myriads 72 of\r\nmen), these, when the fighting began, being well aware what the issue of\r\nthe battle would be, he led carefully, 73 having first given orders that\r\nall should go by the way which he should lead them and at the same pace\r\nat which they should see him go. Having given these orders he led his\r\ntroops on pretence of taking them into battle; and when he was well on\r\nhis way, he saw the Persians already taking flight. Then he no longer\r\nled his men in the same order as before, but set off at a run, taking\r\nflight by the quickest way not to the palisade nor yet to the wall of\r\nthe Thebans, but towards Phokis, desiring as quickly as possible to\r\nreach the Hellespont..\r\n\r\n67. These, I say, were thus directing their march: and in the meantime,\r\nwhile the other Hellenes who were on the side of the king were purposely\r\nslack in the fight, 74 the Boeotians fought with the Athenians for a\r\nlong space; for those of the Thebans who took the side of the Medes had\r\nno small zeal for the cause, and they fought and were not slack, so\r\nthat three hundred of them, the first and best of all, fell there by the\r\nhands of the Athenians: and when these also turned to flight, they fled\r\nto Thebes, not to the same place as the Persians: and the main body of\r\nthe other allies fled without having fought constantly with any one or\r\ndisplayed any deeds of valour..\r\n\r\n68. And this is an additional proof to me that all the fortunes of the\r\nBarbarians depended upon the Persians, namely that at that time these\r\nmen fled before they had even engaged with the enemy, because they saw\r\nthe Persians doing so. Thus all were in flight except only the cavalry,\r\nincluding also that of the Boeotians; and this rendered service to the\r\nfugitives by constantly keeping close to the enemy and separating the\r\nfugitives of their own side from the Hellenes..\r\n\r\n69. The victors then were coming after the troops of Xerxes, both\r\npursuing them and slaughtering them; and during the time when this\r\npanic arose, the report was brought to the other Hellenes who had posted\r\nthemselves about the temple of Hera and had been absent from the battle,\r\nthat a battle had taken place and that the troops of Pausanias were\r\ngaining the victory. When they heard this, then without ranging\r\nthemselves in any order the Corinthians and those near them turned to go\r\nby the skirts of the mountain and by the low hills along the way which\r\nled straight up to the temple of Demeter, while the Megarians and\r\nPhliasians and those near them went by the plain along the smoothest\r\nway. When however the Megarians and Phliasians came near to the enemy,\r\nthe cavalry of the Thebans caught sight of them from a distance hurrying\r\nalong without any order, and rode up to attack them, the commander of\r\nthe cavalry being Asopodoros the son of Timander; and having fallen upon\r\nthem they slew six hundred of them, and the rest they pursued and drove\r\nto Kithairon.\r\n\r\n70. These then perished thus ingloriously; 75 and meanwhile the Persians\r\nand the rest of the throng, having fled for refuge to the palisade,\r\nsucceeded in getting up to the towers before the Lacedemonians came; and\r\nhaving got up they strengthened the wall of defence as best they could.\r\nThen when the Lacedemonians 76 came up to attack it, there began between\r\nthem a vigorous 77 fight for the wall: for so long as the Athenians\r\nwere away, they defended themselves and had much the advantage over\r\nthe Lacedemonians, since these did not understand the art of fighting\r\nagainst walls; but when the Athenians came up to help them, then there\r\nwas a fierce fight for the wall, lasting for a long time, and at length\r\nby valour and endurance the Athenians mounted up on the wall and made a\r\nbreach in it, through which the Hellenes poured in. Now the Tegeans were\r\nthe first who entered the wall, and these were they who plundered the\r\ntent of Mardonios, taking, besides the other things which were in it,\r\nalso the manger of his horse, which was all of bronze and a sight worth\r\nseeing. This manger of Mardonios was dedicated by the Tegeans as an\r\noffering in the temple of Athene Alea, 78 but all the other things\r\nwhich they took, they brought to the common stock of the Hellenes. The\r\nBarbarians however, after the wall had been captured, no longer formed\r\nthemselves into any close body, nor did any of them think of making\r\nresistance, but they were utterly at a loss, 79 as you might expect from\r\nmen who were in a panic with many myriads of them shut up together in a\r\nsmall space: and the Hellenes were able to slaughter them so that out\r\nof an army of thirty myriads, 80 if those four be subtracted which\r\nArtabazos took with him in his flight, of the remainder not three\r\nthousand men survived. Of the Lacedemonians from Sparta there were slain\r\nin the battle ninety-one in all, of the Tegeans sixteen, and of the\r\nAthenians two-and-fifty.\r\n\r\n71. Among the Barbarians those who proved themselves the best men were,\r\nof those on foot the Persians, and of the cavalry the Sacans, and for\r\na single man Mardonios it is said was the best. Of the Hellenes, though\r\nboth the Tegeans and the Athenians proved themselves good men, yet the\r\nLacedemonians surpassed them in valour. Of this I have no other proof\r\n(for all these were victorious over their opposites), but only this,\r\nthat they fought against the strongest part of the enemy's force and\r\novercame it. And the man who proved himself in my opinion by much the\r\nbest was that Aristodemos who, having come back safe from Thermopylai\r\nalone of the three hundred, had reproach and dishonour attached to him.\r\nAfter him the best were Poseidonios and Philokyon and Amompharetos the\r\nSpartan. 81 However, when there came to be conversation as to which of\r\nthem had proved himself the best, the Spartans who were present gave it\r\nas their opinion that Aristodemos had evidently wished to be slain in\r\nconsequence of the charge which lay against him, and so, being as it\r\nwere in a frenzy and leaving his place in the ranks, he had displayed\r\ngreat deeds, whereas Poseidonios had proved himself a good man although\r\nhe did not desire to be slain; and so far he was the better man of the\r\ntwo. This however they perhaps said from ill-will; and all these whose\r\nnames I mentioned among the men who were killed in this battle, were\r\nspecially honoured, except Aristodemos; but Aristodemos, since he\r\ndesired to be slain on account of the before-mentioned charge, was not\r\nhonoured.\r\n\r\n72. These obtained the most renown of those who fought at Plataia, for\r\nas for Callicrates, the most beautiful who came to the camp, not of the\r\nLacedemonians alone, but also of all the Hellenes of his time, he\r\nwas not killed in the battle itself; but when Pausanias was offering\r\nsacrifice, he was wounded by an arrow in the side, as he was sitting\r\ndown in his place in the ranks; and while the others were fighting, he\r\nhaving been carried out of the ranks was dying a lingering death: and he\r\nsaid to Arimnestos 82 a Plataian that it did not grieve him to die for\r\nHellas, but it grieved him only that he had not proved his strength of\r\nhand, and that no deed of valour had been displayed by him worthy of the\r\nspirit which he had in him to perform great deeds. 83\r\n\r\n73. Of the Athenians the man who gained most glory is said to have been\r\nSophanes the son of Eutychides of the deme of Dekeleia,—a deme of which\r\nthe inhabitants formerly did a deed that was of service to them for all\r\ntime, as the Athenians themselves report. For when of old the sons of\r\nTyndareus invaded the Attic land with a great host, in order to bring\r\nhome Helen, and were laying waste the demes, not knowing to what\r\nplace of hiding Helen had been removed, then they say that the men\r\nof Dekeleia, or as some say Dekelos himself, being aggrieved by the\r\ninsolence of Theseus and fearing for all the land of the Athenians, told\r\nthem the whole matter and led them to Aphidnai, which Titakos who was\r\nsprung from the soil delivered up by treachery to the sons of Tyndareus.\r\nIn consequence of this deed the Dekeleians have had continually freedom\r\nfrom dues in Sparta and front seats at the games, 84 privileges which\r\nexist still to this day; insomuch that even in the war which many years\r\nafter these events arose between the Athenians and the Peloponnesians,\r\nwhen the Lacedemonians laid waste all the rest of Attica, they abstained\r\nfrom injury to Dekeleia..\r\n\r\n74. To this deme belonged Sophanes, who showed himself the best of all\r\nthe Athenians in this battle; and of him there are two different stories\r\ntold: one that he carried an anchor of iron bound by chains of bronze\r\nto the belt of his corslet; and this he threw whensoever he came up with\r\nthe enemy, in order, they say, that the enemy when they came forth out\r\nof their ranks might not be able to move him from his place; and when a\r\nflight of his opponents took place, his plan was to take up the anchor\r\nfirst and then pursue after them. This story is reported thus; but the\r\nother of the stories, disputing the truth of that which has been told\r\nabove, is reported as follows, namely that upon his shield, which was\r\never moving about and never remaining still, he bore an anchor as a\r\ndevice, and not one of iron bound to his corslet.\r\n\r\n75. There was another illustrious deed done too by Sophanes; for when\r\nthe Athenians besieged Egina he challenged to a fight and slew Eurybates\r\nthe Argive, 85 one who had been victor in the five contests 86 at the\r\ngames. To Sophanes himself it happened after these events that when he\r\nwas general of the Athenians together with Leagros the son of Glaucon,\r\nhe was slain after proving himself a good man by the Edonians at Daton,\r\nfighting for the gold mines.\r\n\r\n76. When the Barbarians had been laid low by the Hellenes at Plataia,\r\nthere approached to these a woman, the concubine of Pharandates the son\r\nof Teaspis a Persian, coming over of her own free will from the enemy,\r\nwho when she perceived that the Persians had been destroyed and that the\r\nHellenes were the victors, descended from her carriage and came up to\r\nthe Lacedemonians while they were yet engaged in the slaughter.\r\nThis woman had adorned herself with many ornaments of gold, and her\r\nattendants likewise, and she had put on the fairest robe of those which\r\nshe had; and when she saw that Pausanias was directing everything there,\r\nbeing well acquainted before with his name and with his lineage, because\r\nshe had heard it often, she recognised Pausanias and taking hold of his\r\nknees she said these words: \"O king of Sparta, deliver me thy suppliant\r\nfrom the slavery of the captive: for thou hast also done me service\r\nhitherto in destroying these, who have regard neither for demigods nor\r\nyet for gods. 87 I am by race of Cos, the daughter of Hegetorides the\r\nson of Antagoras; and the Persian took me by force in Cos and kept me\r\na prisoner.\" He made answer in these words: \"Woman, be of good courage,\r\nboth because thou art a suppliant, and also if in addition to this\r\nit chances that thou art speaking the truth and art the daughter of\r\nHegetorides the Coan, who is bound to me as a guest-friend more than any\r\nother of the men who dwell in those parts.\" Having thus spoken, for\r\nthat time her gave her in charge to those Ephors who were present, and\r\nafterwards he sent her away to Egina, whither she herself desired to go.\r\n\r\n77. After the arrival of the woman, forthwith upon this arrived the\r\nMantineians, when all was over; and having learnt that they had come\r\ntoo late for the battle, they were greatly grieved, and said that\r\nthey deserved to be punished: and being informed that the Medes with\r\nArtabazos were in flight, they pursued after them as far as Thessaly,\r\nthough the Lacedemonians endeavoured to prevent them from pursuing after\r\nfugitives. 88 Then returning back to their own country they sent the\r\nleaders of their army into exile from the land. After the Mantineians\r\ncame the Eleians; and they, like the Mantineians, were greatly grieved\r\nby it and so departed home; and these also when they had returned sent\r\ntheir leaders into exile. So much of the Mantineians and Eleians.\r\n\r\n78. At Plataia among the troops of the Eginetans was Lampon the son of\r\nPytheas, one of the leading men of the Eginetans, who was moved to go to\r\nPausanias with a most impious proposal, and when he had come with haste,\r\nhe said as follows: \"Son of Cleombrotos, a deed has been done by\r\nthee which is of marvellous greatness and glory, and to thee God has\r\npermitted by rescuing Hellas to lay up for thyself the greatest renown\r\nof all the Hellenes about whom we have any knowledge. Do thou then\r\nperform also that which remains to do after these things, in order that\r\nyet greater reputation may attach to thee, and also that in future every\r\none of the Barbarians may beware of being the beginner of presumptuous\r\ndeeds towards the Hellenes. For when Leonidas was slain at Thermopylai,\r\nMardonios and Xerxes cut off his head and crucified him: to him\r\ntherefore do thou repay like with like, and thou shalt have praise first\r\nfrom all the Spartans and then secondly from the other Hellenes also;\r\nfor if thou impale the body of Mardonios, thou wilt then have taken\r\nvengeance for Leonidas thy father's brother.\".\r\n\r\n79. He said this thinking to give pleasure; but the other made him\r\nanswer in these words: \"Stranger of Egina, I admire thy friendly spirit\r\nand thy forethought for me, but thou hast failed of a good opinion\r\nnevertheless: for having exalted me on high and my family and my deed,\r\nthou didst then cast me down to nought by advising me to do outrage to\r\na dead body, and by saying that if I do this I shall be better reported\r\nof. These things it is more fitting for Barbarians to do than for\r\nHellenes; and even with them we find fault for doing so. However that\r\nmay be, I do not desire in any such manner as this to please either\r\nEginetans or others who like such things; but it is enough for me that\r\nI should keep from unholy deeds, yea and from unholy speech also, and\r\nso please the Spartans. As for Leonidas, whom thou biddest me avenge, I\r\ndeclare that he has been greatly avenged already, and by the unnumbered\r\nlives which have been taken of these men he has been honoured, and\r\nnot he only but also the rest who brought their lives to an end at\r\nThermopylai. As for thee however, come not again to me with such a\r\nproposal, nor give me such advice; and be thankful moreover that thou\r\nhast no punishment for it now.\"\r\n\r\n80. He having heard this went his way; and Pausanias made a proclamation\r\nthat none should lay hands upon the spoil, and he ordered the Helots to\r\ncollect the things together. They accordingly dispersed themselves\r\nabout the camp and found tents furnished with gold and silver, and beds\r\noverlaid with gold and overlaid with silver, and mixing-bowls of gold,\r\nand cups and other drinking vessels. They found also sacks laid upon\r\nwaggons, in which there proved to be caldrons both of gold and of\r\nsilver; and from the dead bodies which lay there they stripped bracelets\r\nand collars, and also their swords 89 if they were of gold, for as to\r\nembroidered raiment, there was no account made of it. Then the Helots\r\nstole many of the things and sold them to the Eginetans, but many things\r\nalso they delivered up, as many of them as they could not conceal; so\r\nthat the great wealth of the Eginetans first came from this, that they\r\nbought the gold from the Helots making pretence that it was brass..\r\n\r\n81. Then having brought the things together, and having set apart a\r\ntithe for the god of Delphi, with which the offering was dedicated of\r\nthe golden tripod which rests upon the three-headed serpent of bronze\r\nand stands close by the altar, and also 90 for the god at Olympia, with\r\nwhich they dedicated the offering of a bronze statue of Zeus ten cubits\r\nhigh, and finally for the god at the Isthmus, with which was made a\r\nbronze statue of Poseidon seven cubits high,—having set apart these\r\nthings, they divided the rest, and each took that which they ought to\r\nhave, including the concubines of the Persians and the gold and the\r\nsilver and the other things, and also the beasts of burden. How much was\r\nset apart and given to those of them who had proved themselves the best\r\nmen at Plataia is not reported by any, though for my part I suppose that\r\ngifts were made to these also; Pausanias however had ten of each thing\r\nset apart and given to him, that is women, horses, talents, camels, and\r\nso also of the other things.\r\n\r\n82. It is said moreover that this was done which here follows, namely\r\nthat Xerxes in his flight from Hellas had left to Mardonios the\r\nfurniture of his own tent, and Pausanias accordingly seeing the\r\nfurniture of Mardonios furnished 91 with gold and silver and hangings of\r\ndifferent colours ordered the bakers and the cooks to prepare a meal as\r\nthey were used to do for Mardonios. Then when they did this as they had\r\nbeen commanded, it is said that Pausanias seeing the couches of gold and\r\nof silver with luxurious coverings, and the tables of gold and silver,\r\nand the magnificent apparatus of the feast, was astonished at the good\r\nthings set before him, and for sport he ordered his own servants to\r\nprepare a Laconian meal; and as, when the banquet was served, the\r\ndifference between the two was great, Pausanias laughed and sent for the\r\ncommanders of the Hellenes; and when these had come together, Pausanias\r\nsaid, pointing to the preparation of the two meals severally: \"Hellenes,\r\nfor this reason I assembled you together, because I desired to show you\r\nthe senselessness of this leader of the Medes, who having such fare as\r\nthis, came to us who have such sorry fare as ye see here, in order\r\nto take it away from us.\" Thus it is said that Pausanias spoke to the\r\ncommanders of the Hellenes.\r\n\r\n83. However, 92 in later time after these events many of the Plataians\r\nalso found chests of gold and of silver and of other treasures; and\r\nmoreover afterwards this which follows was seen in the case of the dead\r\nbodies here, after the flesh had been stripped off from the bones; for\r\nthe Plataians brought together the bones all to one place:—there was\r\nfound, I say, a skull with no suture but all of one bone, and there was\r\nseen also a jaw-bone, that is to say the upper part of the jaw, which\r\nhad teeth joined together and all of one bone, both the teeth that bite\r\nand those that grind; and the bones were seen also of a man five cubits\r\nhigh..\r\n\r\n84. The body of Mardonios however had disappeared 93 on the day after\r\nthe battle, taken by whom I am not able with certainty to say, but I\r\nhave heard the names of many men of various cities who are said to have\r\nburied Mardonios, and I know that many received gifts from Artontes the\r\nson of Mardonios for having done this: who he was however who took up\r\nand buried the body of Mardonios I am not able for certain to discover,\r\nbut Dionysophanes an Ephesian is reported with some show of reason to\r\nhave been he who buried Mardonios..\r\n\r\n85. He then was buried in some such manner as this: and the Hellenes\r\nwhen they had divided the spoil at Plataia proceeded to bury their dead,\r\neach nation apart by themselves. The Spartans made for themselves three\r\nseveral burial-places, one in which they buried the younger Spartans,\r\n94 of whom also were Poseidonios, Amompharetos, Philokyon and\r\nCallicrates,—in one of the graves, I say, were laid the younger men, in\r\nthe second the rest of the Spartans, and in the third the Helots. These\r\nthen thus buried their dead; but the Tegeans buried theirs all together\r\nin a place apart from these, and the Athenians theirs together; and the\r\nMegarians and Phliasians those who had been slain by the cavalry. Of\r\nall these the burial-places had bodies laid in them, but as to the\r\nburial-places of other States which are to be seen at Plataia, these, as\r\nI am informed, are all mere mounds of earth without any bodies in them,\r\nraised by the several peoples on account of posterity, because they were\r\nashamed of their absence from the fight; for among others there is one\r\nthere called the burial-place of the Eginetans, which I hear was raised\r\nat the request of the Eginetans by Cleades the son of Autodicos, a man\r\nof Plataia who was their public guest-friend, 95 no less than ten years\r\nafter these events.\r\n\r\n86. When the Hellenes had buried their dead at Plataia, forthwith they\r\ndetermined in common council to march upon Thebes and to ask the Thebans\r\nto surrender those who had taken the side of the Medes, and among the\r\nfirst of them Timagenides and Attaginos, who were leaders equal to the\r\nfirst; and if the Thebans did not give them up, they determined not to\r\nretire from the city until they had taken it. Having thus resolved,\r\nthey came accordingly on the eleventh day after the battle and began to\r\nbesiege the Thebans, bidding them give the men up: and as the Thebans\r\nrefused to give them up, they began to lay waste their land and also to\r\nattack their wall..\r\n\r\n87. So then, as they did not cease their ravages, on the twentieth day\r\nTimagenides spoke as follows to the Thebans: \"Thebans, since it has been\r\nresolved by the Hellenes not to retire from the siege until either they\r\nhave taken Thebes or ye have delivered us up to them, now therefore let\r\nnot the land of Boeotia suffer 96 any more for our sakes, but if they\r\ndesire to have money and are demanding our surrender as a colour for\r\nthis, let us give them money taken out of the treasury of the State;\r\nfor we took the side of the Medes together with the State and not by\r\nourselves alone: but if they are making the siege truly in order to get\r\nus into their hands, then we will give ourselves up for trial.\" 97 In\r\nthis it was thought that he spoke very well and seasonably, and the\r\nThebans forthwith sent a herald to Pausanias offering to deliver up the\r\nmen..\r\n\r\n88. After they had made an agreement on these terms, Attaginos escaped\r\nout of the city; and when his sons were delivered up to Pausanias, he\r\nreleased them from the charge, saying that the sons had no share in\r\nthe guilt of taking the side of the Medes. As to the other men whom the\r\nThebans delivered up, they supposed that they would get a trial, 98\r\nand they trusted moreover to be able to repel the danger by payment of\r\nmoney; but Pausanias, when he had received them, suspecting this very\r\nthing, first dismissed the whole army of allies, and then took the men\r\nto Corinth and put them to death there. These were the things which\r\nhappened at Plataia and at Thebes.\r\n\r\n89. Artabazos meanwhile, the son of Pharnakes, in his flight\r\nfrom Plataia was by this time getting forward on his way: and the\r\nThessalians, when he came to them, offered him hospitality and inquired\r\nconcerning the rest of the army, not knowing anything of that which had\r\nhappened at Plataia; and Artabazos knowing that if he should tell them\r\nthe whole truth about the fighting, he would run the risk of being\r\ndestroyed, both himself and the whole army which was with him, (for he\r\nthought that they would all set upon him if they were informed of that\r\nwhich had happened),—reflecting, I say, upon this he had told nothing of\r\nit to the Phokians, and now to the Thessalians he spoke as follows:\r\n\"I, as you see, Thessalians, am earnest to march by the shortest way to\r\nThracia; and I am in great haste, having been sent with these men for a\r\ncertain business from the army; moreover Mardonios himself and his army\r\nare shortly to be looked for here, marching close after me. To him give\r\nentertainment and show yourselves serviceable, for ye will not in the\r\nend repent of so doing.\" Having thus said he continued to march his army\r\nwith haste through Thessaly and Macedonia straight for Thracia, being\r\nin truth earnest to proceed and going through the land by the shortest\r\npossible way: 99 and so he came to Byzantion, having left behind him\r\ngreat numbers of his army, who had either been cut down by the Thracians\r\non the way or had been overcome by hunger and fatigue; 100 and from\r\nByzantion he passed over in ships. He himself 101 then thus made his\r\nreturn back to Asia.\r\n\r\n90. Now on the same day on which the defeat took place at Plataia,\r\nanother took place also, as fortune would have it, at Mycale in Ionia.\r\nFor when the Hellenes who had come in the ships with Leotychides the\r\nLacedemonian, were lying at Delos, there came to them as envoys\r\nfrom Samos Lampon the son of Thrasycles and Athenagoras the son of\r\nArchestratides and Hegesistratos the son of Aristagoras, who had been\r\nsent by the people of Samos without the knowledge either of the Persians\r\nor of the despot Theomestor the son of Androdamas, whom the Persians had\r\nset up to be despot of Samos. When these had been introduced before the\r\ncommanders, Hegesistratos spoke at great length using arguments of all\r\nkinds, and saying that so soon as the Ionians should see them they would\r\nat once revolt from the Persians, and that the Barbarians would not wait\r\nfor their attack; and if after all they did so, then the Hellenes\r\nwould take a prize such as they would never take again hereafter; and\r\nappealing to the gods worshipped in common he endeavoured to persuade\r\nthem to rescue from slavery men who were Hellenes and to drive away the\r\nBarbarian: and this he said was easy for them to do, for the ships of\r\nthe enemy sailed badly and were no match for them in fight. Moreover if\r\nthe Hellenes suspected that they were endeavouring to bring them on by\r\nfraud, they were ready to be taken as hostages in their ships..\r\n\r\n91. Then as the stranger of Samos was urgent in his prayer, Leotychides\r\ninquired thus, either desiring to hear for the sake of the omen or\r\nperhaps by a chance which Providence brought about: \"Stranger of Samos,\r\nwhat is thy name?\" He said \"Hegesistratos.\" 102 The other cut short the\r\nrest of the speech, stopping all that Hegesistratos had intended to say\r\nfurther, and said: \"I accept the augury given in Hegesistratos, stranger\r\nof Samos. Do thou on thy part see that thou give us assurance, thou and\r\nthe men who are with thee, that the Samians will without fail be our\r\nzealous allies, and after that sail away home.\".\r\n\r\n92. Thus he spoke and to the words he added the deed; for forthwith the\r\nSamians gave assurance and made oaths of alliance with the Hellenes, and\r\nhaving so done the others sailed away home, but Hegesistratos he bade\r\nsail with the Hellenes, considering the name to be an augury of good\r\nsuccess. Then the Hellenes after staying still that day made sacrifices\r\nfor success on the next day, their diviner being Deïphonos the son of\r\nEuenios an Apolloniate, of that Apollonia which lies in the Ionian gulf.\r\n10201.\r\n\r\n93. To this man's father Euenios it happened as follows:—There are at\r\nthis place Apollonia sheep sacred to the Sun, which during the day feed\r\nby a river 103 running from Mount Lacmon through the land of Apollonia\r\nto the sea by the haven of Oricos; and by night they are watched by\r\nmen chosen for this purpose, who are the most highly considered of the\r\ncitizens for wealth and noble birth, each man having charge of them for\r\na year; for the people of Apollonia set great store on these sheep by\r\nreason of an oracle: and they are folded in a cave at some distance from\r\nthe city. Here at the time of which I speak this man Euenios was keeping\r\nwatch over them, having been chosen for that purpose; and it happened\r\none night that he fell asleep during his watch, and wolves came by into\r\nthe cave and killed about sixty of the sheep. When he perceived this,\r\nhe kept it secret and told no one, meaning to buy others and substitute\r\nthem in the place of those that were killed. It was discovered however\r\nby the people of Apollonia that this had happened; and when they were\r\ninformed of it, they brought him up before a court and condemned him to\r\nbe deprived of his eyesight for having fallen asleep during his watch.\r\nBut when they had blinded Euenios, forthwith after this their flocks\r\nceased to bring forth young and their land to bear crops as before. Then\r\nprophesyings were uttered to them both at Dodona and also at Delphi,\r\nwhen they asked the prophets the cause of the evil which they were\r\nsuffering, and they told them 104 that they had done unjustly in\r\ndepriving of his sight Euenios the watcher of the sacred sheep; for the\r\ngods of whom they inquired had themselves sent the wolves to attack the\r\nsheep; and they would not cease to take vengeance for him till the men\r\nof Apollonia should have paid to Euenios such satisfaction as he himself\r\nshould choose and deem sufficient; and this being fulfilled, the gods\r\nwould give to Euenios a gift of such a kind that many men would think\r\nhim happy in that he possessed it..\r\n\r\n94. These oracles then were uttered to them, and the people of\r\nApollonia, making a secret of it, proposed to certain men of the\r\ncitizens to manage the affair; and they managed it for them thus:—when\r\nEuenios was sitting on a seat in public, they came and sat by him, and\r\nconversed about other matters, and at last they came to sympathising\r\nwith him in his misfortune; and thus leading him on they asked what\r\nsatisfaction he should choose, if the people of Apollonia should\r\nundertake to give him satisfaction for that which they had done. He\r\nthen, not having heard the oracle, made choice and said that if there\r\nshould be given him the lands belonging to certain citizens, naming\r\nthose whom he knew to possess the two best lots of land in Apollonia,\r\nand a dwelling-house also with these, which he knew to be the best house\r\nin the city,—if he became the possessor of these, he said, he would have\r\nno anger against them for the future, and this satisfaction would be\r\nsufficient for him if it should be given. Then as he was thus\r\nspeaking, the men who sat by him said interrupting him: \"Euenios, this\r\nsatisfaction the Apolloniates pay to thee for thy blinding in accordance\r\nwith the oracles which have been given to them.\" Upon this he was angry,\r\nbeing thus informed of the whole matter and considering that he had been\r\ndeceived; and they bought the property from those who possessed it and\r\ngave him that which he had chosen. And forthwith after this he had a\r\nnatural gift of divination, 105 so that he became very famous..\r\n\r\n95. Of this Euenios, I say, Deïphonos was the son, and he was acting\r\nas diviner for the army, being brought by the Corinthians. I have heard\r\nhowever also that Deïphonos wrongly made use of the name of Euenios, and\r\nundertook work of this kind about Hellas, not being really the son of\r\nEuenios.\r\n\r\n96. Now when the sacrifices were favourable to the Hellenes, they put\r\ntheir ships to sea from Delos to go to Samos; and having arrived off\r\nCalamisa 106 in Samos, they moored their ships there opposite the temple\r\nof Hera which is at this place, and made preparations for a sea-fight;\r\nbut the Persians, being informed that they were sailing thither, put out\r\nto sea also and went over to the mainland with their remaining ships,\r\n(those of the Phenicians having been already sent away to sail home):\r\nfor deliberating of the matter they thought it good not to fight a\r\nbattle by sea, since they did not think that they were a match for the\r\nenemy. And they sailed away to the mainland in order that they might\r\nbe under the protection of their land-army which was in Mycale, a body\r\nwhich had stayed behind the rest of the army by command of Xerxes and\r\nwas keeping watch over Ionia: of this the number was six myriads 107 and\r\nthe commander of it was Tigranes, who in beauty and stature excelled the\r\nother Persians. The commanders of the fleet then had determined to take\r\nrefuge under the protection of this army, and to draw up their ships\r\non shore and put an enclosure round as a protection for the ships and a\r\nrefuge for themselves..\r\n\r\n97. Having thus determined they began to put out to sea; and they came\r\nalong by the temple of the \"Revered goddesses\" 10701 to the Gaison\r\nand to Scolopoeis in Mycale, where there is a temple of the Eleusinian\r\nDemeter, which Philistos the son of Pasicles erected when he had\r\naccompanied Neileus the son of Codros for the founding of Miletos; and\r\nthere they drew up their ships on shore and put an enclosure round them\r\nof stones and timber, cutting down fruit-trees for this purpose, and\r\nthey fixed stakes round the enclosure and made their preparations\r\neither for being besieged or for gaining a victory, for in making their\r\npreparations they reckoned for both chances.\r\n\r\n98. The Hellenes however, when they were informed that the Barbarians\r\nhad gone away to the mainland, were vexed because they thought that they\r\nhad escaped; and they were in a difficulty what they should do, whether\r\nthey should go back home, or sail down towards the Hellespont. At last\r\nthey resolved to do neither of these two things, but to sail on to\r\nthe mainland. Therefore when they had prepared as for a sea-fight both\r\nboarding-bridges and all other things that were required, they sailed\r\ntowards Mycale; and when they came near to the camp and no one was seen\r\nto put out against them, but they perceived ships drawn up within\r\nthe wall and a large land-army ranged along the shore, then first\r\nLeotychides, sailing along in his ship and coming as near to the shore\r\nas he could, made proclamation by a herald to the Ionians, saying:\r\n\"Ionians, those of you who chance to be within hearing of me, attend to\r\nthis which I say: for the Persians will not understand anything at all\r\nof that which I enjoin to you. When we join battle, each one of you must\r\nremember first the freedom of all, and then the watchword 'Hebe'; and\r\nthis let him also who has not heard know from him who has heard.\" The\r\ndesign in this act was the same as that of Themistocles at Artemision;\r\nfor it was meant that either the words uttered should escape the\r\nknowledge of the Barbarians and persuade the Ionians, or that they\r\nshould be reported to the Barbarians and make them distrustful of the\r\nHellenes. 108\r\n\r\n99. After Leotychides had thus suggested, then next the Hellenes\r\nproceeded to bring their ships up to land, and they disembarked upon the\r\nshore. These then were ranging themselves for fight; and the Persians,\r\nwhen they saw the Hellenes preparing for battle and also that they\r\nhad given exhortation to the Ionians, in the first place deprived the\r\nSamians of their arms, suspecting that they were inclined to the side of\r\nthe Hellenes; for when the Athenian prisoners, the men whom the army\r\nof Xerxes had found left behind in Attica, had come in the ships of the\r\nBarbarians, the Samians had ransomed these and sent them back to\r\nAthens, supplying them with means for their journey; and for this reason\r\nespecially they were suspected, since they had ransomed five hundred\r\npersons of the enemies of Xerxes. Then secondly the Persians appointed\r\nthe Milesians to guard the passes which lead to the summits of Mycale,\r\non the pretext that they knew the country best, but their true reason\r\nfor doing this was that they might be out of the camp. Against these of\r\nthe Ionians, who, as they suspected, would make some hostile move 109 if\r\nthey found the occasion, the Persians sought to secure themselves in\r\nthe manner mentioned; and they themselves then brought together their\r\nwicker-work shields to serve them as a fence.\r\n\r\n100. Then when the Hellenes had made all their preparations, they\r\nproceeded to the attack of the Barbarians; and as they went, a rumour\r\ncame suddenly 110 to their whole army, and at the same time a herald's\r\nstaff was found lying upon the beach; and the rumour went through their\r\narmy to this effect, namely that the Hellenes were fighting in Boeotia\r\nand conquering the army of Mardonios. Now by many signs is the divine\r\npower seen in earthly things, and by this among others, namely that now,\r\nwhen the day of the defeat at Plataia and of that which was about to\r\ntake place at Mycale happened to be the same, a rumour came to the\r\nHellenes here, so that the army was encouraged much more and was more\r\neagerly desirous to face the danger..\r\n\r\n101. Moreover this other thing by coincidence happened besides, namely\r\nthat there was a sacred enclosure of the Eleusinian Demeter close by the\r\nside of both the battle-fields; for not only in the Plataian land did\r\nthe fight take place close by the side of the temple of Demeter, as\r\nI have before said, but also in Mycale it was to be so likewise. And\r\nwhereas the rumour which came to them said that a victory had been\r\nalready gained by the Hellenes with Pausanias, this proved to be a true\r\nreport; for that which was done at Plataia came about while it was yet\r\nearly morning, but the fighting at Mycale took place in the afternoon;\r\nand that it happened on the same day of the same month as the other\r\nbecame evident to them not long afterwards, when they inquired into\r\nthe matter. Now they had been afraid before the rumour arrived, not for\r\nthemselves so much as for the Hellenes generally, lest Hellas should\r\nstumble and fall over Mardonios; but when this report had come suddenly\r\nto them, they advanced on the enemy much more vigorously and swiftly\r\nthan before. The Hellenes then and the Barbarians were going with\r\neagerness into the battle, since both the islands and the Hellespont\r\nwere placed before them as prizes of the contest.\r\n\r\n102. Now for the Athenians and those who were ranged next to them,\r\nto the number perhaps of half the whole army, the road lay along the\r\nsea-beach and over level ground, while the Lacedemonians and those\r\nranged in order by these were compelled to go by a ravine and along the\r\nmountain side: so while the Lacedemonians were yet going round, those\r\nupon the other wing were already beginning the fight; and as long as\r\nthe wicker-work shields of the Persians still remained upright, they\r\ncontinued to defend themselves and had rather the advantage in the\r\nfight; but when the troops of the Athenians and of those ranged next to\r\nthem, desiring that the achievement should belong to them and not to\r\nthe Lacedemonians, with exhortations to one another set themselves more\r\nvigorously to the work, then from that time forth the fortune of the\r\nfight was changed; for these pushed aside the wicker-work shields and\r\nfell upon the Persians with a rush all in one body, and the Persians\r\nsustained their first attack and continued to defend themselves for\r\na long time, but at last they fled to the wall; and the Athenians,\r\nCorinthians, Sikyonians and Troizenians, for that was the order in which\r\nthey were ranged, followed close after them and rushed in together\r\nwith them to the space within the wall: and when the wall too had been\r\ncaptured, then the Barbarians no longer betook themselves to resistance,\r\nbut began at once to take flight, excepting only the Persians, who\r\nformed into small groups and continued to fight with the Hellenes as\r\nthey rushed in within the wall. Of the commanders of the Persians\r\ntwo made their escape and two were slain; Artaÿntes and Ithamitres\r\ncommanders of the fleet escaped, while Mardontes and the commander of\r\nthe land-army, Tigranes, were slain..\r\n\r\n103. Now while the Persians were still fighting, the Lacedemonians and\r\nthose with them arrived, and joined in carrying through the rest of the\r\nwork; and of the Hellenes themselves many fell there and especially many\r\nof the Sikyonians, together with their commander Perilaos. And those of\r\nthe Samians who were serving in the army, being in the camp of the Medes\r\nand having been deprived of their arms, when they saw that from the very\r\nfirst the battle began to be doubtful, 111 did as much as they could,\r\nendeavouring to give assistance to the Hellenes; and the other Ionians\r\nseeing that the Samians had set the example, themselves also upon that\r\nmade revolt from the Persians and attacked the Barbarians..\r\n\r\n104. The Milesians too had been appointed to watch the passes of the\r\nPersians 112 in order to secure their safety, so that if that should\r\nafter all come upon them which actually came, they might have guides\r\nand so get safe away to the summits of Mycale,—the Milesians, I say, had\r\nbeen appointed to do this, not only for that end but also for fear that,\r\nif they were present in the camp, they might make some hostile move: 113\r\nbut they did in fact the opposite of that which they were appointed\r\nto do; for they not only directed them in the flight by other than the\r\nright paths, by paths indeed which led towards the enemy, but also at\r\nlast they themselves became their worst foes and began to slay them.\r\nThus then for the second time Ionia revolted from the Persians.\r\n\r\n105. In this battle, of the Hellenes the Athenians were the best men,\r\nand of the Athenians Hermolycos the son of Euthoinos, a man who had\r\ntrained for the pancration. This Hermolycos after these events, when\r\nthere was war between the Athenians and the Carystians, was killed in\r\nbattle at Kyrnos in the Carystian land near Geraistos, and there was\r\nburied. After the Athenians the Corinthians, Troizenians and Sikyonians\r\nwere the best.\r\n\r\n106. When the Hellenes had slain the greater number of the Barbarians,\r\nsome in the battle and others in their flight, they set fire to the\r\nships and to the whole of the wall, having first brought out the spoil\r\nto the sea-shore; and among the rest they found some stores of money. So\r\nhaving set fire to the wall and to the ships they sailed away; and\r\nwhen they came to Samos, the Hellenes deliberated about removing the\r\ninhabitants of Ionia, and considered where they ought to settle them in\r\nthose parts of Hellas of which they had command, leaving Ionia to the\r\nBarbarians: for it was evident to them that it was impossible on the one\r\nhand for them to be always stationed as guards to protect the Ionians,\r\nand on the other hand, if they were not stationed to protect them,\r\nthey had no hope that the Ionians would escape with impunity from the\r\nPersians. Therefore it seemed good to those of the Peloponnesians that\r\nwere in authority that they should remove the inhabitants of the trading\r\nports which belonged to those peoples of Hellas who had taken the side\r\nof the Medes, and give that land to the Ionians to dwell in; but the\r\nAthenians did not think it good that the inhabitants of Ionia should\r\nbe removed at all, nor that the Peloponnesians should consult about\r\nAthenian colonies; and as these vehemently resisted the proposal, the\r\nPeloponnesians gave way. So the end was that they joined as allies to\r\ntheir league the Samians, Chians, Lesbians, and the other islanders who\r\nchanced to be serving with the Hellenes, binding them by assurance and\r\nby oaths to remain faithful and not withdraw from the league: and having\r\nbound these by oaths they sailed to break up the bridges, for they\r\nsupposed they would find them still stretched over the straits.\r\n\r\nThese then were sailing towards the Hellespont;.\r\n\r\n107, and meanwhile those Barbarians who had escaped and had been driven\r\nto the heights of Mycale, being not many in number, were making their\r\nway to Sardis: and as they went by the way, Masistes the son of Dareios,\r\nwho had been present at the disaster which had befallen them, was saying\r\nmany evil things of the commander Artaÿntes, and among other things he\r\nsaid that in respect of the generalship which he had shown he was worse\r\nthan a woman, and that he deserved every kind of evil for having brought\r\nevil on the house of the king. Now with the Persians to be called worse\r\nthan a woman is the greatest possible reproach. So he, after he had been\r\nmuch reviled, at length became angry and drew his sword upon Masistes,\r\nmeaning to kill him; and as he was running upon him, Xeinagoras the son\r\nof Prexilaos, a man of Halicarnassos, perceived it, who was standing\r\njust behind Artaÿntes; and this man seized him by the middle and\r\nlifting him up dashed him upon the ground; and meanwhile the spearmen of\r\nMasistes came in front to protect him. Thus did Xeinagoras, and thus he\r\nlaid up thanks for himself both with Masistes and also with Xerxes for\r\nsaving the life of his brother; and for this deed Xeinagoras became\r\nruler of all Kilikia by the gift of the king. Nothing further happened\r\nthan this as they went on their way, but they arrived at Sardis.\r\n\r\nNow at Sardis, as it chanced, king Xerxes had been staying ever since\r\nthat time when he came thither in flight from Athens, after suffering\r\ndefeat in the sea-fight..\r\n\r\n108. At that time, while he was in Sardis, he had a passionate desire,\r\nas it seems, for the wife of Masistes, who was also there: and as she\r\ncould not be bent to his will by his messages to her, and he did not\r\nwish to employ force because he had regard for his brother Masistes and\r\nthe same consideration withheld the woman also, for she well knew that\r\nforce would not be used towards her, then Xerxes abstained from all\r\nelse, and endeavoured to bring about the marriage of his own son Dareios\r\nwith the daughter of this woman and of Masistes, supposing that if\r\nhe should do so he would obtain her more easily. Then having made the\r\nbetrothal and done all the customary rites, he went away to Susa; and\r\nwhen he had arrived there and had brought the woman into his own house\r\nfor Dareios, then he ceased from attempting the wife of Masistes and\r\nchanging his inclination he conceived a desire for the wife of Dareios,\r\nwho was daughter of Masistes, and obtained her: now the name of this\r\nwoman was Artaÿnte..\r\n\r\n109. However as time went on, this became known in the following\r\nmanner:—Amestris the wife of Xerxes had woven a mantle, large and of\r\nvarious work and a sight worthy to be seen, and this she gave to Xerxes.\r\nHe then being greatly pleased put it on and went to Artaÿnte; and being\r\ngreatly pleased with her too, he bade her ask what she would to be given\r\nto her in return for the favours which she had granted to him, for she\r\nshould obtain, he said, whatsoever she asked: and she, since it was\r\ndestined that she should perish miserably with her whole house, said to\r\nXerxes upon this: \"Wilt thou give me whatsoever I ask thee for?\" and he,\r\nsupposing that she would ask anything rather than that which she did,\r\npromised this and swore to it. Then when he had sworn, she boldly asked\r\nfor the mantle; and Xerxes tried every means of persuasion, not being\r\nwilling to give it to her, and that for no other reason but only because\r\nhe feared Amestris, lest by her, who even before this had some inkling\r\nof the truth, he should thus be discovered in the act; and he offered\r\nher cities and gold in any quantity, and an army which no one else\r\nshould command except herself. Now this of an army is a thoroughly\r\nPersian gift. Since however he did not persuade her, he gave her the\r\nmantle; and she being overjoyed by the gift wore it and prided herself\r\nupon it..\r\n\r\n110. And Amestris was informed that she had it; and having learnt that\r\nwhich was being done, she was not angry with the woman, but supposing\r\nthat her mother was the cause and that she was bringing this about, she\r\nplanned destruction for the wife of Masistes. She waited then until her\r\nhusband Xerxes had a royal feast set before him:—this feast is served up\r\nonce in the year on the day on which the king was born, and the name\r\nof this feast is in Persian tycta, which in the tongue of the Hellenes\r\nmeans \"complete\"; also on this occasion alone the king washes his head,\r\n114 and he makes gifts then to the Persians:—Amestris, I say, waited\r\nfor this day and then asked of Xerxes that the wife of Masistes might\r\nbe given to her. And he considered it a strange and untoward thing\r\nto deliver over to her his brother's wife, especially since she was\r\ninnocent of this matter; for he understood why she was making the\r\nrequest..\r\n\r\n111. At last however as she continued to entreat urgently and he was\r\ncompelled by the rule, namely that it is impossible among them that he\r\nwho makes request when a royal feast is laid before the king should\r\nfail to obtain it, at last very much against his will consented; and in\r\ndelivering her up he bade Amestris do as she desired, and meanwhile he\r\nsent for his brother and said these words: \"Masistes, thou art the son\r\nof Dareios and my brother, and moreover in addition to this thou art\r\na man of worth. I say to thee, live no longer with this wife with whom\r\nthou now livest, but I give thee instead of her my daughter; with her\r\nlive as thy wife, but the wife whom thou now hast, do not keep; for it\r\ndoes not seem good to me that thou shouldest keep her.\" Masistes then,\r\nmarvelling at that which was spoken, said these words: \"Master, how\r\nunprofitable a speech is this which thou utterest to me, in that thou\r\nbiddest me send away a wife by whom I have sons who are grown up to be\r\nyoung men, and daughters one of whom even thou thyself didst take as\r\na wife for thy son, and who is herself, as it chances, very much to my\r\nmind,—that thou biddest me, I say, send away her and take to wife thy\r\ndaughter! I, O king, think it a very great matter that I am judged\r\nworthy of thy daughter, but nevertheless I will do neither of these\r\nthings: and do not thou urge me by force to do such a thing as this: but\r\nfor thy daughter another husband will be found not in any wise inferior\r\nto me, and let me, I pray thee, live still with my own wife.\" He\r\nreturned answer in some such words as these; and Xerxes being stirred\r\nwith anger said as follows: \"This then, Masistes, is thy case,—I will\r\nnot give thee my daughter for thy wife, nor yet shalt thou live any\r\nlonger with that one, in order that thou mayest learn to accept that\r\nwhich is offered thee.\" He then when he heard this went out, having\r\nfirst said these words: \"Master, thou hast not surely brought ruin upon\r\nme?\" 115.\r\n\r\n112. During this interval of time, while Xerxes was conversing with his\r\nbrother, Amestris had sent the spearmen of Xerxes to bring the wife of\r\nMasistes, and she was doing to her shameful outrage; for she cut away\r\nher breasts and threw them to dogs, and she cut off her nose and ears\r\nand lips and tongue, and sent her back home thus outraged.\r\n\r\n113. Then Masistes, not yet having heard any of these things, but\r\nsupposing that some evil had fallen upon him, came running to his house;\r\nand seeing his wife thus mutilated, forthwith upon this he took counsel\r\nwith his sons and set forth to go to Bactria together with his sons\r\nand doubtless some others also, meaning to make the province of Bactria\r\nrevolt and to do the greatest possible injury to the king: and this in\r\nfact would have come to pass, as I imagine, if he had got up to the land\r\nof the Bactrians and Sacans before he was overtaken, for they were much\r\nattached to him, and also he was the governor of the Bactrians: but\r\nXerxes being informed that he was doing this, sent after him an army as\r\nhe was on his way, and slew both him and his sons and his army. So far\r\nof that which happened about the passion of Xerxes and the death of\r\nMasistes.\r\n\r\n114. Now the Hellenes who had set forth from Mycale to the Hellespont\r\nfirst moored their ships about Lecton, being stopped from their voyage\r\nby winds; and thence they came to Abydos and found that the bridges had\r\nbeen broken up, which they thought to find still stretched across, and\r\non account of which especially they had come to the Hellespont. So the\r\nPeloponnesians which Leotychides resolved to sail back to Hellas, while\r\nthe Athenians and Xanthippos their commander determined to stay behind\r\nthere and to make an attempt upon the Chersonese. Those then sailed\r\naway, and the Athenians passed over from Abydos to the Chersonese and\r\nbegan to besiege Sestos..\r\n\r\n115. To this town of Sestos, since it was the greatest stronghold of\r\nthose in that region, men had come together from the cities which\r\nlay round it, when they heard that the Hellenes had arrived at the\r\nHellespont, and especially there had come from the city of Cardia\r\nOiobazos a Persian, who had brought to Sestos the ropes of the bridges.\r\nThe inhabitants of the city were Aiolians, natives of the country, but\r\nthere were living with them a great number of Persians and also of their\r\nallies..\r\n\r\n116. And of the province Artaÿctes was despot, as governor under Xerxes,\r\na Persian, but a man of desperate and reckless character, who also had\r\npractised deception upon the king on his march against Athens, in\r\ntaking away from Elaius the things belonging to Protesilaos the son\r\nof Iphiclos. For at Elaius in the Chersonese there is the tomb of\r\nProtesilaos with a sacred enclosure about it, where there were many\r\ntreasures, with gold and silver cups and bronze and raiment and other\r\nofferings, which things Artaÿctes carried off as plunder, the king\r\nhaving granted them to him. And he deceived Xerxes by saying to him\r\nsome such words as these: \"Master, there is here the house of a man,\r\na Hellene, who made an expedition against thy land and met with his\r\ndeserts and was slain: this man's house I ask thee to give to me, that\r\nevery one may learn not to make expeditions against thy land.\" By saying\r\nthis it was likely that he would easily enough persuade Xerxes to give\r\nhim a man's house, not suspecting what was in his mind: and when he said\r\nthat Protesilaos had made expedition against the land of the king, it\r\nmust be understood that the Persians consider all Asia to be theirs and\r\nto belong to their reigning king. So when the things had been given him,\r\nhe brought them from Elaius to Sestos, and he sowed the sacred enclosure\r\nfor crops and occupied it as his own; and he himself, whenever he came\r\nto Elaius, had commerce with women in the inner cell of the temple. 116\r\nAnd now he was being besieged by the Athenians, when he had not made any\r\npreparation for a siege nor had been expecting that the Hellenes would\r\ncome; for they fell upon him, as one may say, inevitably. 117.\r\n\r\n117. When however autumn came and the siege still went on, the Athenians\r\nbegan to be vexed at being absent from their own land and at the\r\nsame time not able to conquer the fortress, and they requested their\r\ncommanders to lead them away home; but these said that they would not do\r\nso, until either they had taken the town or the public authority of the\r\nAthenians sent for them home: and so they endured their present state.\r\n\r\n118. Those however who were within the walls had now come to the\r\ngreatest misery, so that they boiled down the girths of their beds and\r\nused them for food; and when they no longer had even these, then the\r\nPersians and with them Artaÿctes and Oiobazos ran away and departed in\r\nthe night, climbing down by the back part of the wall, where the place\r\nwas left most unguarded by the enemy; and when day came, the men of the\r\nChersonese signified to the Athenians from the towers concerning that\r\nwhich had happened, and opened the gates to them. So the greater number\r\nof them went in pursuit, and the rest occupied the city..\r\n\r\n119. Now Oiobazos, as he was escaping 119 into Thrace, was caught by the\r\nApsinthian Thracians and sacrificed to their native god Pleistoros with\r\ntheir rites, and the rest who were with him they slaughtered in another\r\nmanner: but Artaÿctes with his companions, who started on their flight\r\nlater and were overtaken at a little distance above Aigospotamoi,\r\ndefended themselves for a considerable time and were some of them\r\nkilled and others taken alive: and the Hellenes had bound these and were\r\nbringing them to Sestos, and among them Artaÿctes also in bonds together\r\nwith his son..\r\n\r\n120. Then, it is said by the men of the Chersonese, as one of those who\r\nguarded them was frying dried fish, a portent occurred as follows,—the\r\ndried fish when laid upon the fire began to leap and struggle just as\r\nif they were fish newly caught: and the others gathered round and were\r\nmarvelling at the portent, but Artaÿctes seeing it called to the man who\r\nwas frying the fish and said: \"Stranger of Athens, be not at all afraid\r\nof this portent, seeing that it has not appeared for thee but for me.\r\nProtesilaos who dwells at Elaius signifies thereby that though he is\r\ndead and his body is dried like those fish, 120 yet he has power given\r\nhim by the gods to exact vengeance from the man who does him wrong. Now\r\ntherefore I desire to impose this penalty for him, 121—that in place\r\nof the things which I took from the temple I should pay down a hundred\r\ntalents to the god, and moreover as ransom for myself and my son I will\r\npay two hundred talents to the Athenians, if my life be spared.\" Thus he\r\nengaged to do, but he did not prevail upon the commander Xanthippos; for\r\nthe people of Elaius desiring to take vengeance for Protesilaos asked\r\nthat he might be put to death, and the inclination of the commander\r\nhimself tended to the same conclusion. They brought him therefore to\r\nthat headland to which Xerxes made the passage across, or as some say to\r\nthe hill which is over the town of Madytos, and there they nailed him to\r\nboards 122 and hung him up; and they stoned his son to death before the\r\neyes of Artaÿctes himself..\r\n\r\n121. Having so done, they sailed away to Hellas, taking with them,\r\nbesides other things, the ropes also of the bridges, in order to\r\ndedicate them as offerings in the temples: and for that year nothing\r\nhappened further than this.\r\n\r\n122. Now a forefather of this Artaÿctes who was hung up, was that\r\nArtembares who set forth to the Persians a proposal which they took up\r\nand brought before Cyrus, being to this effect: \"Seeing that Zeus\r\ngrants to the Persians leadership, and of all men to thee, O Cyrus, by\r\ndestroying Astyages, come, since the land we possess is small and also\r\nrugged, let us change from it and inhabit another which is better: and\r\nthere are many near at hand, and many also at a greater distance, of\r\nwhich if we take one, we shall have greater reverence and from more men.\r\nIt is reasonable too that men who are rulers should do such things; for\r\nwhen will there ever be a fairer occasion than now, when we are rulers\r\nof many nations and of the whole of Asia?\" Cyrus, hearing this and not\r\nbeing surprised at the proposal, 123 bade them do so if they would;\r\nbut he exhorted them and bade them prepare in that case to be no longer\r\nrulers but subjects; \"For,\" said he, \"from lands which are not rugged\r\nmen who are not rugged are apt to come forth, since it does not belong\r\nto the same land to bring forth fruits of the earth which are admirable\r\nand also men who are good in war.\" So the Persians acknowledged that he\r\nwas right and departed from his presence, having their opinion defeated\r\nby that of Cyrus; and they chose rather to dwell on poor land and be\r\nrulers, than to sow crops in a level plain and be slaves to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO BOOK IX\r\n\r\n1  [ \"the same who at the former time also were of one accord\r\ntogether.\"]\r\n\r\n2  [ {ta ekeinon iskhura bouleumata}: some good MSS. omit\r\n{iskhura}, and so many Editors.]\r\n\r\n3  [ {up agnomosunes}.]\r\n\r\n4  [ {boulen}.]\r\n\r\n5  [ {exeneikai es ton dumon}.]\r\n\r\n6  [ {aleoren}.]\r\n\r\n7  [ Cp. viii. 140 (a).]\r\n\r\n8  [ {to men ap emeon outo akibdelon nemetai epi tous Ellenas},\r\n\"that which we owe to the Hellenes is thus paid in no counterfeit\r\ncoin.\"]\r\n\r\n9  [ {ekeleusan}, i.e. \"their bidding was\" when they sent us.]\r\n\r\n901  [ This clause, \"with no less—each man of them,\" is omitted\r\nin some MSS. and considered spurious by several Editors.]\r\n\r\n10  [ Cp. ch. 55.]\r\n\r\n11  [ {perioikon}.]\r\n\r\n12  [ {ton emerodromon}, cp. vi. 105.]\r\n\r\n13  [ {tugkhane eu bouleoumenos}: perhaps, \"endeavour to take\r\nmeasures well.\"]\r\n\r\n14  [ {prodromon}, a conjectural emendation of {prodromos}.]\r\n\r\n15  [ {boiotarkhai}, i.e. the heads of the Boeotian\r\nconfederacy.]\r\n\r\n16  [ {os epi deka stadious malista ke}.]\r\n\r\n17  [ {klinai}: several Editors have altered this, reading\r\n{klithenai} or {klinenai}, \"they were made to recline.\"]\r\n\r\n18  [ {diapinonton}, cp. v. 18.]\r\n\r\n19  [ {polla phroneonta medenos krateein}.]\r\n\r\n20  [ {sphodra}: not quite satisfactory with {emedizon}, but it\r\ncan hardly go with {ouk ekontes}, as Krüger suggests.]\r\n\r\n21  [ {pheme}, as in ch. 100.]\r\n\r\n22  [ {proopto thanato}.]\r\n\r\n23  [ {prosballontes}: most of the MSS. have {prosbalontes}, and\r\nso also in ch. 21 and 22 they have {prosbalouses}.]\r\n\r\n24  [ i.e. the retreat with which each charge ended and the turn\r\nfrom retreat in preparation for a fresh charge.
