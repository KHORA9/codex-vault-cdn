Their only regret is that the limits of space prevented them\r\nfrom inviting the assistance of others, and thus of including other\r\nsubjects, which, it may be, some readers would expect to find here.\r\n\r\nBut wide as the range is, it is manifestly impossible in a volume\r\nof this size to cover the whole ground. It does not profess to be a\r\ncomplete history, or to give _all_ those memories of the past which\r\nought to be of interest to those of the present day. Perhaps no county\r\nis richer in these treasures than the county of Chester, and every\r\ncorner of it has its own special ones. The city of Chester gives its\r\ntitle to the heir to the Crown, as the Prince of Wales is always Earl\r\nof Chester; and that fact in itself gives a dignity and importance\r\nto both city and county. Then, as will be pointed out in some of the\r\npapers which follow, as a County Palatine, Cheshire had privileges\r\nand rights of a peculiar character, and all this has made the task of\r\nselection of subjects to be treated of more difficult, and the reader\r\nwill doubtless sympathise with the Editors, even though he may not\r\naltogether approve of the result of their labours, and may lament\r\ncertain omissions.\r\n\r\nSome memorials of old Cheshire will be presented to the mind and eyes\r\nof many in the Historic Pageant which is to take place in July, and\r\nwill give further proof of the wealth of material from which selection\r\nhad to be made. We may hope that both this volume and the Pageant will\r\nhave an educative effect, in that they will lead residents in the\r\ncounty, and the rising generation in particular, to take a growing and\r\nintelligent interest in its history. This may be done either in the\r\nsmall and confined space of the parish in which they live, or in the\r\nwider sphere of the neighbourhood, or of the county as a whole. And it\r\ncan be done by individual search and inquiry, and by association with\r\nthe Societies which foster and promote such studies as conduce to the\r\ncreation of a greater interest in the story of the past, and in the\r\npreservation of the objects which will keep it alive.\r\n\r\nWe have to thank the Chester and North Wales Archæological and\r\nHistoric Society for the loan of some illustrations, and are only\r\nsorry that more could not be inserted. We have photographs from Dr.\r\nElliott, Mr. F. Simpson, Mr. G. W. Haswell, and others, some admirable\r\ndrawings by Mr. C. H. Minshull, whilst His Honour Sir Horatio Lloyd\r\nhas permitted us to reproduce a sketch of his of the old High Cross at\r\nChester.\r\n\r\nWe were fortunate to secure the services of so busy a man as Professor\r\nJ. C. Bridge, M.A., F.S.A., for two of the papers, both of which\r\nwill be found most instructive, dealing as they do with distinctive\r\npeculiarities of the county, and giving evidence of full and wide\r\nknowledge of the subjects treated of. To one and all, named and\r\nunnamed, we tender our cordial thanks, and trust that the present\r\nvolume may be regarded as a not unworthy successor of those in the\r\nsame series which have preceded it.\r\n\r\n                                                       Edward Barber.\r\n                                                       P.

Ditchfield, M.A., F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nBright and fair is the Cheshire land and well renowned in story. It\r\nis one of the most famous counties in England, and can raise its head\r\nproudly above other less noted shires. It rejoices in being a County\r\nPalatine, its Earls in former days having sovereign jurisdiction\r\nwithin its precincts. The Earls of Chester held their own Parliaments,\r\nsummoned the barons and tenants to the conclave, and Acts of\r\nParliament passed by English houses of representatives had no force\r\nwithin the Palatinate of Cheshire. It had its own courts of justice\r\nfor determining all pleas of land, tenements, contracts, felonies,\r\n&c. It was an _imperium in imperio_, and though Lancashire and Durham\r\nclaimed similar privileges of Palatinate, their County Palatines were\r\nestablished later than that of Chester and were not so well settled,\r\nnor their powers and privileges so clearly defined. For a brief space\r\nCheshire was a Principality, and Richard II. styled himself _Princeps\r\nCestriæ_, and it can still boast of having a Prince for its Earl, the\r\ntitle of Earl of Chester being always borne since the reign of King\r\nHenry III. by the eldest son of the kings of England.\r\n\r\nFamous, too, is the county for its illustrious sons. Speed, a Cheshire\r\nman, who ought therefore to know well the truth of his statements,\r\nthough perhaps for that reason a little partial, says: “The shire may\r\nwell be said to be a seedplot of Gentilitie, and the producer of many\r\nmost ancient and worthy families; neither hath any brought more men of\r\nvalour into the Field than Cheeseshire hath done, who, by a generall\r\nspeech, are to this day called The Chiefe of men; and for nature’s\r\nendowments (besides their noblenesse of mindes) may compare with any\r\nother nation in the world; their limmes strait and well-composed;\r\ntheir complexions faire, with a cheerfull countenance; and the Women\r\nof a grace, feature and beautie, inferior unto none.”\r\n\r\nVerily, Master Speed was a patriotic son, but he was not far from the\r\ntruth. Cheshire men have had their detractors, as who have not? These\r\nscurrilous, envious persons have dared to frame this distich:\r\n\r\n    “Cheshire born and Cheshire bred,\r\n     Strong i’ th’ arm and weak i’ th’ yed.”\r\n\r\nIt sounds like a taunt thrown across the border of my native county\r\nof Lancashire. Strong i’ th’ arm Cheshire men have ever been, as\r\nthe story of many a fight and foray in which they have gallantly\r\nplayed their part has effectually told, but the long line of Cheshire\r\nworthies serves to prove that their heads are not weaker than those\r\nof their neighbours. If you need a further testimony to their\r\nexcellences, you can refer to the sixteenth-century Cheshire tourist,\r\nwho wrote of them: “They are of a stomach, stout, bold, and hardy;\r\nof stature tall and mighty; withall impatient of wrong, and ready to\r\nresist the enemy or stranger that shall invade their countrey; the\r\nvery name whereof they cannot abide, and namely, of a Scot.” Possibly\r\nthey have since that time seen fit to modify their dislike of the\r\ngentlemen from across the Tweed, who are said by a modern critic “to\r\nkeep the Sabbath and everything else they can lay their hands on.”\r\n\r\nThe story of the shire presents many features of unique interest. Its\r\nproximity to Wales rendered it the field of many a wild fight between\r\nthe sturdy Cheshire men and the warlike Welsh folk, and required the\r\npossession of a powerful garrison. The port of Chester was the chief\r\nplace of embarkation for troops, which the turbulent Irishmen often\r\nneeded for the preservation of peace, and Briton, Saxon, Dane, and\r\nNorman have left traces behind them of their presence in the county.\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of the Romans the district was inhabited by a\r\nwarlike British tribe called Cornavii, whose territory embraced most\r\nof the counties on the Welsh border. They were a strong and martial\r\npeople, who gave much trouble to the Roman conquerors, and required a\r\nformidable company of legionaries to keep them in order. The Romans\r\nfirmly established themselves on the banks of the Dee, or Deva as\r\nthey called the river. They knew well the district of Great Meols,\r\nwhere many coins and _fibulæ_ have been discovered, but their great\r\nstronghold was Chester. The discoveries of Roman remains in the city\r\nare so important that no other place in the kingdom can rival it,\r\nand most of these have been found during the last twenty-two years.\r\nBuilt into the Roman city wall were found a large number of inscribed,\r\nsculptured, or moulded stones, probably taken from the Roman cemetery,\r\nerected in memory of the soldiers who fought in Roman legions. They\r\nestablish some interesting historical facts. First, we gather from a\r\nstone erected to the memory of a soldier, whose name is lost, that the\r\nlegionaries were here in the earliest years of the Roman conquest of\r\nBritain, about A.D. 50. The conquerors pushed along the old Watling\r\nStreet, which led to the Dee, and must have established themselves\r\nthere very soon after their advent to Britain. Secondly, we learn that\r\nChester was the permanent quarters of two special legions, Legio II.,\r\nAdiutrix Pia Fidelis, and Legio XX., Valeria Victrix. Nearly all the\r\ninscriptions relate to soldiers of one or other of these troops. When\r\nthe Second Legion was withdrawn to defend the Danube frontier, the\r\nTwentieth remained to guard the Chester country, and sent contingents\r\nto protect the forts of Manchester and North Wales. From the fact\r\nthat these memorial stones of Roman soldiers were afterwards taken\r\nfrom the cemetery and built up in the Roman wall of the city, Dr.\r\nHaverfield has determined that the Roman wall of Chester was built in\r\nthe latter part of the second century or in the commencement of the\r\nthird century. But we must leave the inviting subject of the Roman\r\nantiquities of Chester to another chapter.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a noble place in Roman times, with its walls and\r\nstreets and houses replete with the usual fittings with which the\r\nRomans used to love to surround themselves. It was a great centre of\r\ntraffic, situated on the Watling Street that ran from Richborough,\r\nthrough Chester to Anglesea, and through Chester to Manchester, York,\r\nand Carlisle. Suetonius pitched his camp at Chester, and Claudius\r\nCæsar and the Emperor Galba are said to have visited it. The existence\r\nof Julius Cæsar’s Tower will doubtless suggest to the “raw antiquary”\r\nmentioned below a visit of the illustrious conqueror.\r\n\r\nWhen the Roman legions were withdrawn to defend the centre of the\r\nEmpire, the British remained masters of the country as far as the\r\nPicts and Scots would permit. Cheshire is far from Kent, where soon\r\nthe dreaded Teutonic races made their appearance, and established\r\ntheir rule over the enfeebled Britons. The country of the Deeside\r\nremained at peace. Caer-Leon, or Caer Leon Vaur[1] as the Britons\r\ncalled it, heard only the smooth-tongued tones of Celtic speech, and\r\nnothing disturbed its quietude, as far as is known, until in A.D. 613\r\nthe fury of war burst upon the British people. Christianity had taught\r\nthem many holy lessons of faith. Wales, with Cheshire, was a land of\r\nsaints. Bede tells us that the monastery of Bangor, which may have\r\nbeen the Christian Banchor, about 15 miles from Chester, “flourished\r\nwith learned men at the coming of Augustine.” SS. David, Asaph, and\r\nPadern all flourished after the Saxons had occupied England, and the\r\nsixth century saw, not only the foundation of the Welsh bishoprics,\r\nbut also of the great Welsh monasteries, which were the especial\r\nglory of the Church in Wales. But the British Christians liked not\r\nAugustine, his haughty ways, and his new-fangled customs, and at a\r\ncouncil refused subjection. So Augustine waxed wroth, and said that\r\n“if they would not preach the way of life to the English, they should\r\nat their hands undergo the vengeance.”\r\n\r\n [1] The imagination of the Celtic mind has made Chester the Neomagus,\r\n founded by Magus, son of Samothes, son of Japheth, 240 years after the\r\n Flood. They say a giant named Leon Vaur, a conqueror of the Picts,\r\n built a city here, which was afterwards beautified by two British\r\n princes, Caerleid and Caerleir. But, concludes the chronicler, “they\r\n are but raw antiquaries that will give credit to such relations.”\r\n\r\nA terrible storm did burst upon the unhappy people. The heathen King\r\nEthelfrid of Northumbria came down upon the fair land of Cheshire,\r\ndefeated the Britons, captured and destroyed Chester. The monks of\r\nBangor came in crowds to the battle to offer prayers for the success\r\nof their countrymen, and nearly 1200 of them were slaughtered. Bede,\r\nwith his Roman leanings, sees in this slaughter the execution of the\r\nDivine judgment and a fulfilment of Augustine’s prophecy--a suggestion\r\nunworthy of the pious historian. If the Divine wrath was turned\r\nupon the people of Cheshire and the monks, it was soon dispelled.\r\nEthelfrid’s triumph was of short duration. Soon the gallant Welsh\r\nprinces raised an army, marched on Chester, defeated the Northumbrian\r\nKing with great slaughter, and elected Cadwan King of Wales at Chester.\r\n\r\nFor more than a century Cheshire remained under British rule, but\r\nstronger grew the Saxon power, when the rival kingdoms of Mercia and\r\nWessex had settled their quarrels; and in A.D. 828 King Egbert came to\r\nCheshire, captured the city, and made the country parts of the Mercian\r\nkingdom. This Mercian kingdom embraced a large extent of country, and\r\nwas not divided into shires until the beginning of the tenth century.\r\nThe older counties--Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Hants, Wilts, Berkshire,\r\nDorset, Somerset, Devon, Cornwall, Middlesex, Essex, Suffolk,\r\nNorfolk--some of them representing old kingdoms, are known to have\r\nexisted as defined districts in the ninth century. In these the shire\r\nis not named after the chief town except in Hants; but when, in A.D.\r\n912, Mercia was divided, each shire took its name from the county\r\ntown. Thus we have Stafford-shire, Worcester-shire, and others, and\r\nChester-shire or Cheshire. The county then assumed the concrete shape\r\nand size which it has since preserved.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the ninth century came the first visit of those dread\r\nmarauders, the Danes, who carried fire and sword through so many\r\nfair regions of England. From Northumberland they swooped down on\r\nthe fields of Cheshire, led by the sea-king Hastings, and “arrived\r\nat a western city in Wirall which is called Lega-ceaster. Then were\r\nthe forces [of King Alfred] unable to come up with them before they\r\nwere in the fortress; nevertheless they beset the fortress about for\r\nsome two days, and took all the cattle that were there without, and\r\nslew the men whom they were able to take without the fortress, and\r\nburned all the corn, and with their horses ate it every morning.”[2]\r\nThe Danes liked not this, and were reduced to eating horse-flesh,\r\nand were glad to leave the country and escape to North Wales. The\r\n_Saxon Chronicle_ tells us nothing more of the visits of the Danes.\r\nHigden mentions that at the close of the tenth century the county was\r\nlaid waste by pirates, doubtless the sea-rovers, the Danes, but the\r\nevidence of names proves that the Danes were firmly established in the\r\nshire as settlers. By the Peace of Wedmore in A.D. 878, they won from\r\nAlfred all the country east and north of Watling Street, including\r\nthe greater part of Cheshire. Indications of their presence are not\r\nso strong as in Lancashire, but these are sufficiently plain to show\r\nthey partially colonised the country. There is a church at Chester\r\ndedicated to St. Olave, a Scandinavian king and saint, to whom the\r\nDanish colony in London dedicated a church (Tooley Street in London\r\nis, of course, a corruption of St. Olaf’s Street). All names ending\r\nin _by_ are Danish, of which we have Kirby, Pensby, Irby, Frankby,\r\nGreasby. That the Danes were Christians is proved by such names as\r\nKirby, Kirkdale, Crosby. But the most remarkable memorial of all is\r\nthe name Thingwall, the place where the Folkmote or Thing met. It\r\nis surrounded by several other villages with Scandinavian names on\r\nthe small tongue of land between the Dee and the Mersey. Sometimes a\r\nCeltic name is met with, which has survived amid the Saxon and Danish\r\npopulation, such as Meols, Dove, Llandican, and Inch. Further inland\r\nSaxon names predominate, such as Bebington, Oldfield, Woodchurch,\r\nUpton.\r\n\r\n [2] _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, A.D. 892; according to other authorities,\r\n 894.\r\n\r\nOver the poor remains of Mercia that remained to Alfred’s rule he set\r\nthe Ealdorman Æthelred, the husband of his daughter Æthelflæd, or\r\nEthelfleda, a ruler well fitted for his courage to guard against the\r\ninroads of the Danes. He rebuilt Chester, which had been ruinated by\r\nthe wars. On his death the government devolved on his spirited widow\r\nof whom Henry of Huntingdon says:\r\n\r\n    “O potent Ethelfleda, terrible to men,\r\n     Whom courage made a king, nature a queen.”\r\n\r\nShe built a town or fortress at Eddisbury in the forest of Delamere,\r\nand another at Runcorn. The English power grew stronger in the land.\r\nIn 920 King Edward the Elder built the city Thelwall on the Mersey,\r\nand placed a garrison there. King Edgar was at Chester in 973, and\r\nreceived the homage of eight petty kings, or chieftains, Kenneth III.\r\nof Scotland, Malcome of Cumberland, Macon of the Isle of Man, James of\r\nGalloway, Howell of North Wales, Owen of South Wales, and two joint\r\nrulers, Sfreth of South Wales and Inkil of Cumberland. Ralph Higden,\r\nthe monk of Chester, relates a story of his having been rowed by them\r\nfrom his palace to the Church of St. John, and Dean Howson, when\r\nspeaking of this church, said:\r\n\r\n “As regards the historical associations, it should be observed in\r\n the first place that the water in front of the church is that reach\r\n of the river Dee over which the Saxon King Edgar was rowed in 973 by\r\n eight British chieftains. His landing place is on the rocky ground\r\n immediately under the church, and from the church, on looking down\r\n the river towards the old bridge, can be seen the starting point of\r\n that short but very expressive voyage. The picturesque little chapel\r\n among the foliage is also connected by tradition with Saxon history.\r\n It is said that Harold, having ‘lost hys lefte eye’ in the battle of\r\n Hastings, ‘yescaped to the countrey of Chester and lived there holylie\r\n in St. James’s cell, fast by Saynt John’s Church.’”\r\n\r\nThis last is, of course, pure legend, but the story of the wonderful\r\nrowing seems to be fully accepted by the Dean, and is not scoffed at by\r\nmost Cheshire historians.\r\n\r\nWhen Cnut the Dane ruled over English land, he committed the government\r\nof this part of Mercia to certain chief men with the dignity of Earl,\r\nwho were styled Earls of Chester. Only three of these ruled during\r\nthe closing years of the Anglo-Saxon period--Leofric, the son of\r\nLeofwin; Algar, the son of Leofric; and Edwin, son of Edgar. Then the\r\nNormans came, and many changes took place in the Cheshire land. The\r\nConqueror confiscated the estates of the Saxon gentlemen and nobility,\r\nand bestowed them upon his Norman adventurers and followers. He gave\r\nthe Earldom of Chester to Gherbod, a noble of Flanders; but he was\r\ncompelled to go to his native land, was seized by his enemies, and\r\nretained a prisoner. So the King gave the title to Hugh Lupus, son of\r\nthe Viscount of Avranches, his sister’s son, a valiant soldier, whose\r\nefforts were much needed to restrain the tumultuous Welsh. He gave to\r\nthe Earl a Palatinate jurisdiction and sovereign power, to be held\r\nunder the King in the province over which he ruled. These are the terms\r\nof the grant:\r\n\r\n “Tenere totum hunc comitatum sibi et heredibus suis ita liberè ad\r\n gladium ut ipse Rex tenebat Angliæ coronam.”\r\n\r\nHugh Lupus had several barons to assist him in council. These were\r\nNigel his cousin, Baron of Halton, Constable and Marshal of Chester;\r\nSir Pierce Malbane, Baron of Nantwich; Robert FitzHugh, Baron of\r\nMalpas; Robert de Vernon, Baron of Shipbrook; Hamon Massey, Baron of\r\nDunham; Walter de Pointon, Baron of Stockport; and Eustace Crew de\r\nMontalt, Baron of Hawarden.\r\n\r\nThe stark Earl was as good a Christian as he was a soldier. He sought\r\nthe advice of the saintly Anselm, and sent for him from Normandy to\r\nChester, and so brought to England its future Archbishop of Canterbury.\r\nBy his counsel Earl Hugh converted the Nunnery of St. Werburgh into an\r\nAbbey, replacing the nuns by monks of the Benedictine Order. His Welsh\r\nneighbours caused endless trouble. He built a castle at Halton, and\r\ngave the barony to Nigel, on condition that he should be Constable of\r\nChester, and by the service of leading the vanguard of the Earl’s army\r\nwhenever he should march into Wales.\r\n\r\nThe history of Cheshire during the two centuries after the coming of\r\nthe Normans is a record of the incursions of the Welsh, and of the\r\ncontinued attempts of the English to resist them. The country was\r\nreduced to a deplorable condition. The Welsh raided and ravaged the\r\nlands next their borders. English armies came to Cheshire, consumed\r\nthe produce of the farms, and often burned the corn and killed the\r\nlive-stock lest the Welsh should seek for plunder. Many of these raids\r\nfind no place in history; only those are recorded which were attended\r\nby startling results. We can mention only a few of them. In 1093\r\nthey came, led by Griffith ap Conan, and made great slaughter. They\r\nfought a great battle at Nantwich during the rule of Hugh Lupus. In\r\n1121 they made a raid and burned two castles, Shocklach and Malpas,\r\ncelebrated for its bad road. In 1150 they came again, but were cut off\r\non their return at Nantwich. King Henry II. in 1156 came with an army\r\nand encamped on Saltney Marsh. Ten years later he came by sea with\r\nan army to Chester, determining to crush the Welsh by invading their\r\nterritory; but his heart failed him, and he abandoned the enterprise.\r\nIn 1212 these terrible Welshmen took castles, killed the garrisons,\r\nburned several towns, and returned home rejoicing laden with plunder.\r\nKing John marched to Chester determined to punish these outrageous\r\nfolk who loved fighting, but he had certain troubles with his barons\r\nwhich need not be here chronicled; and being assured that if he marched\r\nagainst the foe he would be either assassinated or handed over to the\r\ntender mercies of the marauders, he preferred to hie him back to\r\nLondon. Matthew Paris, the old chronicler, tells us much about these\r\nterrible doings--how in 1245 Henry III. tried in vain to conquer them,\r\nand then caused a fearful famine in Cheshire by destroying all the\r\ncorn and produce, including the salt pits, lest the Welsh should gain\r\nplunder; how again in 1256 the Welsh invaded the country and ravaged\r\nit to the very gates of the city, and by way of reminder repeated the\r\nprocess in the next year. Even the stark Prince Edward they defeated,\r\nand King Henry came himself with a mighty army to reduce them to order.\r\nHe adopted the usual tactics of burning the provisions of the poor\r\nCheshire farmers, and was thus hoist on his own petard, as his army\r\ncould not find food, and the expedition was abandoned. Then James,\r\nLord Audley, who on returning from abroad found his castles burnt and\r\nhis retainers slaughtered, being mightily enraged, marched into Wales\r\nto slay these terrible folk. He killed many, but he might as well\r\nhave tried to sweep back the waves that beat on the Wirral shore. The\r\npertinacious foe only retaliated and attacked his lands again. And so\r\nthe fight went on backwards and forwards, houses and castles being\r\nburnt, men and women slain, crops destroyed, until the whole county\r\nwas reduced to a howling, desolate wilderness. The duel between Prince\r\nLlewellyn and Edward I. is well known. The King brought an army to\r\nChester; the Prince sued for peace, and the expedition was abandoned.\r\nIn 1274 the King summoned Llewellyn to a conference at Chester, which\r\ninvitation the Prince, perhaps wisely, declined. Instead of coming to a\r\nconference, he made inroads and plundered the country. Then Edward in\r\n1277 marched with a vast army to Chester. He cut great avenues through\r\nthe forests, so as to protect his men from ambuscades. He marched into\r\nWales in triumph. Llewellyn made his submission, but this did not\r\nprevent him from renewing his inroads four years later. At last he was\r\nkilled in a skirmish by Lord Mortimer, and the land had rest. Edward\r\ngave to his infant son, born at Carnarvon, the title of Prince of\r\nWales, and peace at length descended on the hills and vales of Cheshire\r\nwhich for two hundred years had been complete strangers to it.\r\n\r\nOur chronicle of the Welsh wars and plunderings has carried us far\r\nafield, and we must hark back to the line of Earls who ruled over the\r\nharassed Palatinate. When Hugh Lupus died without issue, the Earldom\r\ndescended to Ranulph Bohun, who married his sister, Margaret. He took\r\nfor his arms three wheat sheaves or in a field azure, which are the\r\npresent arms of the city. He was succeeded by his son, Hugh de Bohun,\r\nin 1152, who foolishly joined the rebellious Prince Henry against his\r\nfather Henry II., and was sent a prisoner to Normandy. Ranulph III.\r\nsucceeded, and earned the title of “the Good.” He founded several\r\nabbeys, fought in the Crusades, and drove the Dauphin Lewis out of\r\nEngland, who had come to depose King John.\r\n\r\nDuring the Wars of the Barons against Henry III., a battle was fought\r\nbetween the Earl of Derby and a large force for the barons against the\r\nroyal army led by William, Lord Zouche, David, brother to Llewellyn,\r\nand John, Lord Audley, when the Earl was victorious and Chester was\r\ncaptured in 1264. John, Earl of Chester, adopted a novel expedient to\r\nend the Welsh invasions. He married Helena, the daughter of Llewellyn,\r\nduring an interval of peace in order to confirm it. But the lion and\r\nthe lamb might as well have mated, and the wild turbulent Princess\r\nproved a strange bride. History records not the differences of that\r\nill-assorted alliance. Perhaps he tried to tame her too severely.\r\nPerhaps he was but a faint-hearted Petruchio. At any rate she poisoned\r\nhim, and, leaving no children, the King took the Earldom into his own\r\nhands and gave it to his eldest son, Prince Edward. When this Prince\r\nwas captured by Simon de Montfort, he was forced to relinquish the\r\nEarldom as part of his ransom, but on the triumph of the King’s forces\r\nit reverted again to the Crown.\r\n\r\nRichard II., in his troubles with the barons, chose a bodyguard of\r\n2000 Cheshire men, so trusting was he in their loyalty and bravery.\r\nAs a reward for their fidelity he made the county a Principality by\r\nAct of Parliament, styling himself _Princeps Cestriæ_, as we have\r\nalready noticed. This honour the county did not long enjoy, as Henry\r\nof Lancaster revoked the Act. Not all the men of Cheshire were loyal\r\nto Richard, or were perhaps wearied of him. When the storm burst some\r\nof them, including Sir Richard and Sir John Legh, went over to Henry’s\r\nside. He came to Chester and raised an army there, and executed Sir\r\nPiers Legh, who had remained faithful to Richard. Soon the men of\r\nChester saw the stern Duke of Lancaster marching into the city, and\r\nbehind him rode their unfortunate King, a prisoner in the hands of one\r\nwho knew no pity, and soon to be done to death at Pontefract Castle.\r\nReports were circulated that Richard was still alive. In 1403 the Earl\r\nof Northumberland and Lord Percy, commonly called “Hotspur,” conspired\r\nagainst Henry IV. and ordered the news that Richard was living to be\r\nproclaimed throughout the county, stating that he could be seen at\r\nChester Castle. The Cheshire men rallied to their old adherence, and\r\nreadily joined the standard of the Northumbrian Earl. Every one knows\r\nthe result of the fatal fight fought within sight of Chester walls,\r\nwhen most of the knights and squires, the flower of Cheshire chivalry,\r\nlay dead on the stricken field. Woeful was the day for Cheshire men.\r\nHenry captured the Baron of Kinderton and Sir Richard Vernon, and\r\nbeheaded them. Even some who fought on the King’s side fell in battle,\r\nincluding Sir John Calveley and Sir John Massey. Moreover, the stern\r\nHenry was wroth against the county, and every man felt that his head\r\nwas in jeopardy. But in the following year the King was pleased to\r\npardon the county, and extracted a fine of 300 marks from the city.\r\n\r\nThe valour of Cheshire men has shone forth on many a battlefield.\r\nLook at that gallant feat of arms at the battle of Poictiers, when\r\nLord Audley and his four Cheshire knights, Sir John Delves, Sir\r\nThomas Dutton, Sir Robert Foulshurst, and Sir John Hawkstone won for\r\nthemselves undying fame. Sir Piers Legh of Macclesfield, from whom are\r\ndescended the Leighs of Lyme, had the lordship of that place granted\r\nto him for taking the Count of Tankerville prisoner. He was afterwards\r\nslain at Agincourt. But in our unhappy Civil Wars the good gentlemen\r\nof Cheshire were never a united body. They espoused different causes,\r\nranged themselves under different banners, and so fought against each\r\nother and slew each other. It was so in Richard’s time. It was so at\r\nBlore Heath in 1459, when neighbour fought with neighbour and many\r\nfell, amongst whom were Sir Thomas Dutton, Sir John Done, Sir Hugh\r\nVenables, Sir Richard Molineux, Sir William Troutbeck, Sir John Legh of\r\nBooths, and Sir John Egerton. Thus does Drayton sing of this unhappy\r\nslaughter:--\r\n\r\n    “Then Dutton Dutton kills; and Done doth kill a Done;\r\n     A Booth a Booth; and Leigh by Leigh is overthrown;\r\n     A Venables against a Venables doth stand,\r\n     A Troutbeck fighteth with a Troutbeck hand to hand:\r\n     Then Molineux doth make a Molineux to die;\r\n     And Egerton the strength of Egerton doth try.\r\n     Oh Cheshire! wert thou mad of thine own native gore,\r\n     So much until this day thou never shedd’st before!\r\n     Above two thousand men upon the earth were thrown,\r\n     Of whom the greatest part were naturally thine own.”\r\n\r\nAgain, on Flodden Field, the valour of the Cheshire men was proved.\r\nMacclesfield had cause to weep over the slaughter of her sons,\r\nincluding her brave mayor, Sir Edmund Savage. Again, in the Scottish\r\nWar, in 1544, they showed their fighting powers; of the sixty men\r\nknighted at Leith, one-third were gallant Cheshire men.\r\n\r\nBefore we close this account of the mediæval period, we notice the\r\nshire studded with fine towns and villages, fine churches, and noble\r\nmonasteries. Of these we may mention the Monastery of St. Werburgh,\r\nfounded by Hugh Lupus at Chester; and the smaller houses of St. John\r\nfor secular canons, of St. Francis, a Franciscan monastery founded\r\nby King John and suppressed by Cardinal Wolsey for the founding of\r\nhis college at Oxford; and the Nunnery of St. Mary, founded by Earl\r\nRanulph. At Birkenhead there was a priory of Black Canons founded by\r\nHano de Massey, Earl of Derby, and dedicated to SS. Mary and James. At\r\nCombermere there was a house of White Monks founded in 1134 by Hugo\r\nMaltana. At Dernhall was a Cistercian house, founded by Edward I. in\r\nperformance of a vow which he made for a deliverance at sea. This was\r\nafterwards removed to Vale Royal, and became a large monastery with a\r\nhundred Cistercian monks, and was valued at £32,000. It was consecrated\r\nby the Patriarch of Jerusalem, with the Bishop of Durham and many other\r\nprelates. Another Cistercian monastery was founded by Robert Pincerna\r\nin 1153 at Poulton, and then removed to Dentacres. A Collegiate Church\r\nwas established at Macclesfield by Thomas Savage, Archbishop of York,\r\nin 1508. He was born at that place, and this showed his affection for\r\nit. His death prevented him from finishing it, but his heart was buried\r\nthere. Mobberley Abbey of the Canons Regular of St. Augustine was\r\nfounded by Patrick de Mobberley; a Priory at Norton by William, son of\r\nNigel, Constable of Chester. He founded also one at Runcorn in 1133,\r\nbut afterwards removed it to Norton. Stanlaw Abbey was founded in 1172\r\nby John de Lacy, Constable of Chester, but it was afterwards removed to\r\nWhalley, where the fine ruins testify to its former magnificence.\r\n\r\nSuch were the principal monastic houses in the county which the decree\r\nof ruthless Henry VIII. doomed to destruction. Chester was one of the\r\nsees founded by him out of the spoils of the monasteries, together with\r\nBristol, Oxford, Westminster, Gloucester, and Peterborough, and the\r\nChurch of the Monastery of St. Werburgh was assigned as a Cathedral.\r\nPreviously the Bishop’s Chair was placed in the grand old Church of St.\r\nJohn, as there were Bishops of Chester in ancient times, as the author\r\nof the _Holy Life of St. Werburgh_ sings:--\r\n\r\n    “Also the see of Lichfield was translate to Chester\r\n     By helpe and suffrance of the bysshop Peter”;\r\n\r\nand that good Bishop Peter enlarged the stately Church of St. John,\r\nwhich dated back to Earl Ethelred and his good wife Ethelfleda. The\r\nstory of St. John’s Church is full of fascination, especially when told\r\nby its vicar, Canon Cooper Scott.\r\n\r\nDesolation reigned throughout the land when the King’s Commissioners\r\nhad stripped the churches and chapels of their valuables and\r\nendowments. The historian of _Vale Royal_, writing of the deserted and\r\nruined chantries and chapels, states: “Wherein nothing now but the\r\ntune of lacrymæ is sung, crying out mercy, not for sinners, but for\r\nmiserable singers, in these days.”\r\n\r\nChester saw the sad burning of George Marsh, a Marian martyr.\r\n\r\nThe incessant passing of the military connected with the settlement\r\nof the Irish confiscated estates and of soldiers oscillating between\r\nthe Low Countries and Ireland, and the constant presence of fierce,\r\nreckless adventurers, kept alive a martial spirit and made the county\r\nextremely lively. The following examples may suffice to show how great\r\na thoroughfare Chester had become:--\r\n\r\n1594.--There came into Chester at several times 2200 footmen and 1000\r\nhorsemen to go to Ireland for the suppression of the rebellion of Hugh\r\nFardorough, Earl of Tyrone. The mayor had much ado to keep the soldiers\r\nquiet, and caused a gibbet to be set up at the high cross whereon three\r\nsoldiers had like to be hanged.\r\n\r\n1595.--There came to Chester at several times 2400 footmen and 300\r\nhorsemen to go to Ireland.\r\n\r\n1596.--Nine hundred soldiers came to Chester, whereof 500 were sent\r\nto Ireland, and the rest, staying for a wind, were disbanded and sent\r\naway.\r\n\r\n1597.--A thousand footmen and 280 horsemen came at several times and\r\nwent into Ireland.\r\n\r\n1598.--The Earl of Essex, lieutenant-general for the wars in Ireland,\r\ncame into Chester, and with him three other earls, besides many other\r\nlords, knights, and gentlemen, who were honourably received by the\r\nMayor and his brethren. A great army of soldiers went over to serve in\r\nIreland, both horsemen and footmen, all under the command of the said\r\nEarl.\r\n\r\n1599.--The 14th of February the Lord Mountjoy, Deputy of Ireland, and\r\nwith him a great train, dined with the Mayor the 17th of February,\r\nand departed towards Wales the 19th of February to take shipping for\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n1591.--Many soldiers were this year sent into Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn 1600 still larger consignments were sent and passed through the\r\ncounty. We hear of 4000 foot and 200 horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of the City of Chester.]\r\n\r\nSoon the bugles of war sounded nearer at hand, and Charles was fighting\r\nagainst the Parliamentarians. Another pen will describe the horrors\r\nof that fearful war, and of that terrible siege of Chester, when the\r\nloyal inhabitants were nearly starved. We seem to see the ill-fated\r\nmonarch watching with sad eyes from the Phœnix Tower on the city wall\r\nthe defeat of his troops at Rowton Moor. Cheshire was a vast theatre\r\nof war, and witnessed more fighting than almost any other county. And\r\nsad was the havoc wrought. As in olden days, the gentlemen of Cheshire\r\nwere as divided as ever; some were loyal, and others espoused the\r\ncause of the Parliament. Beeston Castle withstood a brave siege, and\r\nwas afterwards “slighted” by Cromwell and reduced to its present state\r\nof ruin. Doddington Castle, Crewe Hall, Dorfold Hall, Cholmondeley\r\nHall, Carden Hall were garrisoned, and endured attacks and sieges.\r\nNantwich was a stronghold of the Parliamentarians; and even churches,\r\nsuch as Barthomley and Acton, were garrisoned and besieged. Adlington\r\nHall, Stockport, Broughton Hall, Malpas, Tarvin, Huxley Hall, Birket\r\nHouse, Bunbury, and Nether-Legh all saw much fighting, and suffered\r\nfrom sieges or attacks. A volume would be needed to tell of all\r\nthe fightings in Cheshire during that disastrous war. No less than\r\ntwenty-two of the great and beautiful houses of the gentlemen of the\r\nshire were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe Cheshire folk soon wearied of Cromwell and Puritan ways, and as\r\nearly as 1655 several of the principal gentry were imprisoned at\r\nChester on the charge of disaffection to the Government. Four years\r\nlater Sir George Booth, with the Earl of Derby, Lord Cholmondeley, and\r\nothers raised 3000 men “to deliver the nation from slavery.” A battle\r\nwas fought at Winnington Bridge, near Northwich, but Booth’s forces\r\nwere defeated. The Restoration of King Charles in the following year\r\nwas but a fulfilment of the design of the Cheshire “Chief of Men.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Monmouth honoured the county with a visit in 1683,\r\nhunting for popularity and representing himself as the champion of\r\nProtestantism against the Roman tendencies of James II. His visit\r\ncaused a “No Popery” riot in the Cathedral, when the mob did terrible\r\ndamage, broke the font and organ, tore up surplices, destroyed the\r\nglass, and much else. The Duke acted as godfather to the Mayor’s infant\r\ndaughter, attended the Wallasey Races, rode his own horse, won the\r\ncup, and presented it to his godchild. The heads of the good citizens\r\nwere turned by his graciousness, but that did not prevent them from\r\nringing the bells of St. John’s Church when the news came of his\r\ndefeat at Sedgemoor. He is said to have hatched his insurrection at\r\nBidston. Henry, Lord Delamere, son of Sir George Booth, was accused of\r\nan intention of raising a troop for the Duke, and had the unpleasant\r\nexperience of being tried before the notorious Judge Jefferies, but\r\nstrange to say he was acquitted. A few years later came James II., who\r\nheard mass in the little Early English chapel at the Castle. The good\r\nfolk of Chester liked not his Roman Catholic ways, and we read the\r\n“King departed from Chester not well pleased with the disposition of\r\nthe people.” His course was soon run, and he fled the country.\r\n\r\nAgain the divided counsels of the Cheshire men were displayed. While\r\nLord Delamere was raising a great force to support Dutch William,\r\nmarching south to meet him, Lord Molyneux and Lord Acton seized Chester\r\nfor King James. Happily no fighting was needed.\r\n\r\nWhen James II. landed in Ireland in the spring of 1689 a large army\r\nwas collected to oppose him. It was led by the Duke Schomberg, and\r\nsuffered severely in camp during the ensuing winter for want of\r\nconveniences and even necessaries. Most of the army encamped for a\r\nweek at Neston, and then embarked at Highlake (Hoylake) for Ireland.\r\nThere were about a hundred vessels to convey them, and the port and\r\nriver must have presented an animated scene. In the following summer\r\nlarge reinforcements passed through the city at various times, and the\r\nfarmers of West Kirkby, Grange, Neston, and Meols made good profits\r\nby entertaining the officers billeted on them. William III. came in\r\nperson, the army being encamped on the Wallasey Leasowes. He was\r\nat Chester on Sunday, June 10, attended service at the Cathedral,\r\nand slept at the house of William Glegg, Esquire of Gayton, whom he\r\nafterwards knighted.\r\n\r\nSince that time no great events in the annals of England have occurred\r\nto disturb the peace of Cheshire. In subsequent chapters we hope to\r\nrecord the names of many of Cheshire’s illustrious sons, and of the\r\ngreat and noble families who have shed lustre on the shire. We shall\r\nroam the countryside, see the traces of the great historic past, note\r\nthe beauties of the ancestral houses, the half-timbered mansions, the\r\nred-sandstone farms, and if it be our good fortune to have been born\r\nwithin its borders, one of Cheshire’s “Chief of Men,” feel no little\r\nproud of our heritage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE COUNTY PALATINE OF CHESTER: ITS PLACE IN HISTORY\r\n\r\n  By Henry Taylor (Chester), F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat safe guide Stephen’s _Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of\r\nEngland_, the English law student’s _vade mecum_, in treating of “The\r\nKingdom of England itself,” says:--\r\n\r\n “Three of the English counties, viz. Chester, Durham, and Lancaster,\r\n are called Counties _Palatine_. The two former are such by\r\n prescription or immemorial custom, which dates back at least to the\r\n Norman Conquest. Lancaster was created a County Palatine by Edward the\r\n Third in favour of Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Lancaster, whose heiress\r\n being married to John of Gaunt, the King’s son, the franchise was\r\n greatly enlarged and confirmed in Parliament to honour John of Gaunt\r\n himself.\r\n\r\n “Counties Palatine are so called _a palatio_ because the owners\r\n thereof, the Earl of Chester, the Bishop of Durham, and the Duke of\r\n Lancaster, had formerly in those counties _jura regalia_ as fully as\r\n the King in his palace. That is to say, they might pardon treasons,\r\n murders, and felonies; they appointed judges and justices of the\r\n peace; all writs and indictments ran in their names, as in other\r\n counties in the King’s; and all offences were said to be done against\r\n their peace, and not as in other places _contra pacem domini regis_.\r\n These palatine privileges, so similar to the regal independent\r\n jurisdictions usurped by the great barons on the Continent, during\r\n the weak and infant state of the first feudal kingdoms in Europe,\r\n were in all probability originally granted to the counties of Chester\r\n and Durham because these counties bordered upon inimical countries,\r\n Wales and Scotland; in order that the owners, being encouraged by\r\n so large an authority, might be the more watchful in its defence.\r\n In the twenty-seventh year of Henry the Eighth, however, the powers\r\n before mentioned of the owners of these three counties palatine\r\n were abridged, the reason for their continuance having in a manner\r\n ceased, and in modern times alterations have taken place in regard to\r\n the administration of justice in the counties palatine, which have,\r\n for the most part, assimilated them in that respect to the rest of\r\n England. Thus by the Law Terms Act, 1830, the jurisdiction of the\r\n Court of Session of the County Palatine of Chester was abolished,\r\n and that county was subjected in all things to the jurisdiction of\r\n the Superior Courts of Westminster. And by the Judicature Act, 1873,\r\n the jurisdictions of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster and of\r\n the Court of Pleas of Durham were respectively transferred to the\r\n High Court of Justice, by that Act established. None of the counties\r\n palatine any longer remain in the hands of subjects. For the Earldom\r\n of Chester was united to the Crown by Henry the Third, and has ever\r\n since been one of the titles of the monarch’s eldest son; the palatine\r\n jurisdiction of Durham was taken from the Bishop of Durham by the\r\n Durham (County Palatine) Act, 1836 (amended by the Durham Palatine\r\n Act, 1858), and was vested as a separate franchise and royalty in the\r\n Crown; and the County Palatine of Lancaster, with the duchy which had\r\n been conferred on John of Gaunt, was at length, in the year 1485,\r\n vested in King Henry the Seventh and his heirs, as a distinct and\r\n separate inheritance from the Crown of England.”\r\n\r\nOf these three Palatinates we must, however, here treat only of\r\nChester, the eldest of the trio. There were Earls of Chester in Saxon\r\ntimes, but the establishment of the Palatine County of Chester dates\r\nfrom the Norman Invasion. Before we proceed to describe its foundation\r\nand history, let us see what Camden, in his quaint way, has to say\r\nabout Cheshire and its inhabitants. Quoting Lucian the Monk of Chester,\r\nhe remarks:--\r\n\r\n “Whoever sets about to describe the manners of the inhabitants of this\r\n County in general, or in particular, according to their situation, he\r\n will find them in comparison with those of other parts of England in\r\n some respects better, in others the same. Their manners seem to be in\r\n the main of the best sort, according to the general idea of manners.\r\n They are sociable in their entertainments, cheerful at meals, liberal\r\n in their hospitality, hasty, but soon brought to temper, impatient\r\n of dependance and bondage, kind to the distressed, compassionate\r\n to the poor, fond of their relations, sparing of labour, free from\r\n resentment, not given to excess in eating, undesigning, fond of\r\n borrowing other people’s property, abounding with woods and pastures,\r\n rich in meat and cattle. They border on one side the Britons, and by\r\n long commerce of manners are become very like them. Nor must I forget\r\n to observe that the County of Chester bounded by Lime (Macclesfield)\r\n Forest from the rest of England enjoys distinguished immunities, and\r\n by the indulgences of our Kings and the great merit of its Earls is\r\n more accustomed to attend on the Sword of its own Prince than on the\r\n Crown of the Sovereign in the assembly of the people, and without\r\n restraint or reserve determine the most important causes within its\r\n own territories. Hence Chester itself is much frequented by Irish, a\r\n neighbour to the Welsh, and plentifully supplied with provisions by\r\n the English; beautifully situated, its gates are of an ancient form\r\n of building; approved by hard experience. It has merited the name of\r\n City by its river and its watch-towers, defended by a watchful guard\r\n of holy men and through the mercy of our Saviour it has always been\r\n preserved by divine assistance.”\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Freeman has said: “Chester was the last English city\r\nto bow to the Norman invader. After the fall of Chester no integral\r\npart of the English kingdom remained unsubdued. William was full King\r\nover all England.”\r\n\r\nRecognising, as the Romans before him had done, that Chester was the\r\nkey to Wales, and also that it could be made the headquarters for an\r\ninvasion of Ireland, the Norman Conqueror placed a great military\r\ncamp there, and in A.D. 1070 granted to his kinsman and follower\r\nHugh, surnamed Lupus of Avranches (which is situate on the borders of\r\nNormandy and Brittany close by Mont St. Michael), the whole of the\r\npresent county of Chester, and as much of the neighbouring parts of\r\nWales as he could secure, to hold as an independent state inferior to\r\nthe Crown of England, “ita libere ad gladium, sicut ipse Rex totam\r\ntenebat Angliam ad coronam,” “as the very words of the Charter do run,”\r\nsaith Camden. Which words, says Leycester the Chester antiquary, “some\r\nexpound to be the tenure of being Sword-bearer of England, whence we\r\nread in Matthew Paris that when Henry III. married Eleanor of Provence,\r\nA.D. 1236, the marriage was pompously solemnised, and all the great men\r\nof the kingdom used those offices and places which had of ancient right\r\nbelonged to their ancestors at the coronation of the Kings. The Earl\r\nof Chester (John Scot) then carried the Sword of St. Edward (which is\r\ncalled Curtein) before the King in token that he was an Earl Palatine\r\nand had power by right to restrain the King if he should do amiss, his\r\nConstable of Cheshire attending on him.\r\n\r\n“But although this office might have of ancient right belonged to the\r\nEarls of Chester ever since the time of Hugh Lupus, yet I believe\r\nthere is something more magnificent couched in these words of the\r\nfirst Charter or donation--namely, a dignity inherent in the Sword,\r\nas purchased by it, and to be kept by it also; for as in the Crown of\r\nEngland there is an inherent right of regality annexed, so here is\r\ngiven an inherent right of dignity in the Sword. This is to hold as\r\nfreely by the Sword as the King holds by the Crown, only inferior to\r\nthe King. Hence was it that whatsoever we say concerning the pleas of\r\nthe Crown or to be done against the King’s Crown and Dignity, the same\r\nis also said (but in a more limited sense) concerning the pleas of\r\nthe Sword of Chester, or against the Sword and Dignity of the Earl of\r\nChester, as is most evident out of the records and indictments of those\r\ntimes.”\r\n\r\nThere were seven of these Norman Earls, viz.:--\r\n\r\n   I. Hugh Lupus, before mentioned.\r\n\r\n  II. Richard his son who, when only twenty-five years of age\r\n      and soon after his marriage, was drowned in the _White Ship_\r\n      catastrophe, together with his bride and the two sons (William\r\n      and Richard) of King Henry the First.\r\n\r\n III. Randle Meschines, Viscount Bayeux of Normandy.\r\n\r\n  IV. Randle Gernons.\r\n\r\n   V. Hugh Cyveilioc.\r\n\r\n  VI. Randle Blundeville.\r\n\r\n VII. John the Scot, Earl of Huntingdon, who died without issue at\r\n      Darnhall Abbey, Cheshire, on the 7th June 1237.\r\n\r\nThese Norman Earls had their Chamberlains or Chancellors; also Justices\r\n(before whom causes which of their nature should otherwise belong\r\nrespectively to the King’s Bench and Common Pleas were triable), a\r\nBaron of Exchequer, a Sheriff and other officers similar to those of\r\nthe Crown at Westminster.\r\n\r\nThey also had palatinate Barons who held court in council with them.\r\nThe form of act or grant of Hugh Lupus began thus: “Ego Comes Hugo et\r\nmei Barones.” These barons were--\r\n\r\n   I. Nigel, Baron of Halton, High Constable of Cheshire.\r\n\r\n  II. Robert, Baron of Monte Alto or Montalt (Hawarden and Mold),\r\n      High Steward of Cheshire.\r\n\r\n III. William, Baron of Wich Maldeberg (Nantwich).\r\n\r\n  IV. Robert FitzHugh, Baron of Malpas.\r\n\r\n   V. Richard Vernon, Baron of Shipbrook.\r\n\r\n  VI. Hamo de Massie, Baron of Dunham-Massie.\r\n\r\n VII. Gilbert Venables, Baron of Kinderton, whose heirs male in\r\n      the direct line continued until 1679--the last survivors of the\r\n      Barons of Cheshire.\r\n\r\nVIII. Nicholas, Baron of Stockport.\r\n\r\n  IX. Robert, Baron of Rhuddlan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Hugh Lupus Earle of Chester\r\n  sitting in his Parliament with\r\n  the Barons and Abbots of\r\n  that Countie Palatine.\r\n]\r\n\r\nEach of these barons had his own court of all pleas, suits, and plaints\r\n(except such as belonged to the Earl), and power of life and death. The\r\nlast instance of the execution of this latter power was in the person\r\nof Hugh Stringer, who was tried for murder in the court of Sir Thomas\r\nVenables, Baron of Kinderton, and was executed in 1597.\r\n\r\nThe business of these barons was to attend the Earl in Council, follow\r\nhim, and grace his court, and as an old record sets forth, “they were\r\nbound in time of war with the Welsh to find for each knights-fee\r\none horse harnessed or two unharnessed within the divisions of\r\nCheshire. And their knights and free tenants were to be furnished with\r\nbreastplates and haubergeons, and to defend their respective fees in\r\nperson.”\r\n\r\nThe Abbots of Chester and Combermere also had their own courts as\r\nwell as the barons, and doubtless they and the heads of the other\r\nmonasteries and priories were called to the Earl’s Council in the same\r\nway that other ecclesiastics were summoned to the Parliaments of the\r\nearly Kings of England. We here give a copy of the plate by Hollar in\r\nKing’s _Vale Royal_ of “Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, sitting in his\r\nParliament with the Barons and Abbots of that County Palatine.”\r\n\r\nOf these Norman Earls of Chester the distinguished pre-eminence of Earl\r\nRandle Blundeville during his long and active rule has been noticed by\r\nall writers on Cheshire history. That he was a strong man is evidenced\r\nby his refusal in 1232 to comply with the demand for money from the\r\ncounty made by Henry III., as well as by his resistance to that King’s\r\npermission given to the Pope’s officers to collect Peter’s Pence in\r\nhis Palatinate, and his expulsion of those officers from the county,\r\nwhereas all England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales paid.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Blundeville was surprised and surrounded in his Castle\r\nof Rhuddlan by a superior force of Welsh. He contrived to send a\r\nmessage to his Constable de Lacy for help. It happened that the Abbot’s\r\ngreat fair was being held at Chester, and de Lacy at once collected\r\nfrom those attending it an immense crowd of “Players, Fiddlers,\r\nMusicians, and other loose persons,” and marched with them to the\r\nrelief of Rhuddlan. The Welsh seeing this immense host, and hearing\r\nwithal the terrible discord of “harp, flute, sackbut, psaltery, and\r\nother kinds of music,” evidently concluded that Bedlam was let loose,\r\nraised the siege, and took flight.\r\n\r\n    “Was ever an enemy thrown in such plight?\r\n     Did ever a pen such a hist’ry indite?\r\n     And yet the fact’s true as black differs from white!”\r\n\r\nAfter the Earl’s return he rewarded de Lacy with an exclusive\r\nprerogative over the “Trades and Mysteries” of the followers in his\r\nrabble army. The Constable’s son, John de Lacy, reserved his exclusive\r\nprivileges over the mechanic occupations, but granted the Player and\r\nMinstrel prerogative to Hugh Dutton of Dutton and his heirs, who was\r\nthe son of that Dutton who marched at the head of the minstrels. The\r\nDutton family and their successors, down to the year 1756, regularly\r\nheld a court (which in the Cheshire Recognisance Rolls is called\r\n“a Court of Histrionics”), and granted licences to play on musical\r\ninstruments within the county and within the city of Chester. The\r\nvarious Acts of Parliament passed for the regulation of “Players\r\nMinstrels and other Rogues and Vagabonds” specially recognise this\r\nright, and exempt Cheshire from their provisions. We believe to this\r\nday this right is recognised in the grant of certain music diplomas.\r\n\r\nThe rule of the Norman Earls of Chester may be said to have extended\r\nover a period of about one hundred and sixty-seven years--that is to\r\nsay, from the time of the grant to Hugh Lupus down to the death of John\r\nthe Scot, when, he having died in 1237 without male issue, the Crown\r\nseized the Earldom. King Henry III. then gave it to his son, Prince\r\nEdward, probably in 1245 (together with other possessions), on his\r\nmarriage with the Princess Eleanor of Castile. Two years after this\r\nthe new Earl--the first of the royal Earls of Chester--made his public\r\nentry into his county palatine, and in its ancient metropolis received\r\nthe homage of his officers and military tenants. The entry in the\r\n_Chronicle_ of St. Werburgh’s Abbey recording the event runs thus:--\r\n\r\n “1236. On the Feast of Kenelm (July 17) The Lord Edward, Earl of\r\n Chester, entered Chester for the first time, and was received with all\r\n due respect, as well the Clergy as the laity having gone forth to meet\r\n him. Having remained three days to receive the homage and fealty, as\r\n well of the Nobles of Chester as of Wales, he set out for Wales, to\r\n inspect his lands and Castles there, and returning on the day of the\r\n invention (or finding) of (the relics of) S. Stephen, August 3rd, he\r\n left Chester and returned to England,[3] going by way of Darnall.”\r\n\r\n [3] Observe the expression “left Chester and returned to England.”\r\n Cheshire was a separate state apart from England.\r\n\r\nOn Prince Edward succeeding to the throne, he relinquished the Earldom\r\nin favour of his eldest son. His successors, on being invested with the\r\nexecutive power when they created their heirs-apparent to the Crown\r\nPrinces of Wales, at the same time invested them with the Earldom. The\r\noldest title the present King when Prince of Wales held was that of\r\nEarl of Chester.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the present county of Flint was held by the\r\nNorman Earls before the conquest of Wales. King Edward I., after he\r\nhad created it into a separate county, attached it to the “Sword of\r\nChester” as presently described. It is evident that it was considered\r\nan important appanage to the Earldom, as from time to time the name\r\nFlint has been associated with that of Chester, the title adopted being\r\nthat of Earl of Chester and Flint. Edward of Windsor, eldest son of\r\nEdward II., was summoned to Parliament by the name of Earl of Chester\r\nand Flint, “since which time it has been continued as a title in the\r\nPrinces of Wales; and there you will be sure to find who were Earls of\r\nFlint,” says Peter Heylyn in his _Help to English History_. The last\r\nPrince of Wales summoned by that title to Parliament was Prince George,\r\nafterwards George II., in 1714.\r\n\r\nIf the reigning sovereign had no son to succeed him, the Earldom\r\nappears to have been retained by the Crown until a new creation.\r\nThis was so in the case of Richard II., who styled himself Prince of\r\nChester, and created the county palatine a principality. This, however,\r\nwas revoked in the following reign.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been a close attachment between this King and the\r\npeople of Chester and of Wales, doubtless in consequence of the esteem\r\nin which they held his father, the Black Prince, whom they followed in\r\nhis French wars, and who had placed confidence in them. King Richard\r\nhad a bodyguard of 2000 Cheshire archers, many of whom accompanied him\r\nin his ill-fated expedition to Ireland, on his return from which he was\r\ntaken prisoner by Bolingbroke at Flint Castle, and from there, it is\r\nsaid, brought to Chester Castle on his way to London.\r\n\r\nWhen the conquest of Wales had been finally completed by the defeat\r\nand death of Prince Llewelyn, Edward the First proceeded to regulate\r\nthe administration of the territory he had acquired. By his ordinance\r\ncalled the “Statute of Rhudland,” he formed Flintshire into a county,\r\nattached, as previously mentioned, but subordinate to, that of Chester,\r\nand directed the Sheriff of Flintshire to render his accounts to\r\nthe Exchequer there. The judges were appointed, sometimes for both\r\ncounties, at others for each county separately. By the same statute the\r\ngreater part of the district governed by Llewelyn was divided into the\r\nthree counties of Anglesey, Carnarvon, and Merioneth, and it was to\r\nthese counties that the name of “North Wales” was originally confined.\r\nChester and North Wales were the oldest of the Welsh Judicial Circuits.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, on the petition of the Welsh themselves, in the reign of\r\nthe Tudor King, Henry VIII., Wales was incorporated with England, and\r\nthe Lordships Marches were divided into shires, the counties of Denbigh\r\nand Montgomery being added to North Wales. Wales then for the first\r\ntime sent representatives to the English Parliament, but it was not\r\nuntil the reign of his son, King Edward VI., that the County Palatine\r\nof Chester was given parliamentary representation. Professor Freeman\r\nhas said:--\r\n\r\n “The Earldom of Hugh of Avranches stood alone in its greatness from\r\n the rest of the realm. How distinct Chester and Durham stood from\r\n the rest of the kingdom, is best shown by their having for so many\r\n ages (not until the reign of Edward VI.) no voice in the national\r\n Parliament. While Chester had its own courts and own baronage, knights\r\n and citizens from the all but independent state would have been as\r\n much out of place as knights and citizens from the Isle of Man or the\r\n Norman islands of the English Channel.”\r\n\r\nAbout this time also, viz. in 1542, it was enacted that sessions for\r\nthe administration of justice should be held twice in every year in\r\neach of the twelve shires of Wales, to be called “The King’s Great\r\nSessions of Wales,” apparently to distinguish them from those of the\r\nJustices of the Peace, who were directed to be eight in number in each\r\ncounty, and to hold their sessions four times a year. For the business\r\nof the Great Sessions, Wales was divided into four districts, each\r\nindependent of the rest, with its own judge and its own establishment\r\nof judicial officers. Anglesey, Carnarvon, and Merioneth continued as\r\nbefore under the Justice of North Wales, and formed the North Wales\r\nCircuit; while Denbigh and Montgomery were joined to Chester, to\r\nwhich, as before mentioned, Flint from its first creation had been\r\nattached. Each Circuit at first had a single judge, but in the reign\r\nof Elizabeth a second one was added. The judges were styled Justices,\r\nand within the limits of their Circuits they exercised all the powers\r\nof the Justices of King’s Bench and Common Pleas. They also had an\r\nequitable jurisdiction, but important equity cases were seldom brought\r\nbefore them, as the Court of Chancery was open to Welsh suitors, and\r\nit was only in matters of immediate urgency that the powers of the\r\nGreat Sessions as a Court of Equity were found of use. In equity an\r\nappeal lay to the House of Lords, and in legal cases “error” could be\r\nbrought in the King’s Bench. In the administration of criminal law,\r\nwhen cases of difficulty arose the opinion of the twelve Judges was\r\nobtained, in a similar way to that which was pursued in England. The\r\nprocess of the Courts could only be executed in the counties of the\r\nCircuit, and the want of further power to give effect to their orders\r\noutside their jurisdiction was one of their greatest disadvantages. But\r\nwhen final judgment had been obtained, a transcript of the record could\r\nbe removed and execution issued from one of the Superior Courts. Each\r\nCircuit had its judicial seal. The use of seals was looked upon as a\r\nmatter of paramount importance (as it is in many foreign Courts at the\r\npresent time), and Henry VIII. himself is stated to have devised these\r\nseals. The original seal of Chester was used for Flint. Here we give\r\nan illustration from the last seal which was in use when the Chester\r\nPalatinate Court was dissolved. Another original seal for the shires\r\nof Denbigh and Montgomery was entrusted to the Steward and Chamberlain\r\nof Denbigh, and these two counties formed in some respects a distinct\r\ndivision of the Chester Circuit. Causes commenced in the Superior\r\nCourts could be sent down to Chester to be tried. The equitable\r\njurisdiction at Chester belonged to the Chamberlain and not to the\r\nJustices. The Chamberlain’s Court is described as having been one of a\r\nvery singular character, and to have administered a mixture of law and\r\nequity. The Vice-Chamberlain presided as the Judge, and the business,\r\nwhich is said to have been at one time considerable, appears latterly\r\nto have been small; but it is to be regretted that it was abolished and\r\nnot retained, as in the adjoining County Palatine of Lancaster, as in\r\nthese days it would have been of great use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The last seal which was in use when the Chester\r\nPalatinate Court was dissolved.]\r\n\r\nThe Chief-Justiceship of Chester, being the most lucrative as well as\r\nthe most important of the Welsh Judgeships, was looked upon as one of\r\nthe great prizes of the profession, and was held by many distinguished\r\nmen. When the Great Session came to an end the salary of the Chief\r\nJustice was £1630, and that of the second Justice £1250. An annual\r\npension of £1015, 12s. was granted to Thomas Jervis (father of Sir\r\nJohn Jervis, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas), who was second\r\nJustice of Chester, by way of compensation for loss of his office. The\r\nChief-Justiceship of Cheshire was vacant at the time. In Ormerod’s\r\n_History of Chester_, in the _History of the Great Sessions of Wales_,\r\nby Mr. W. R. Williams, and in the contribution to the _History of\r\nthe Courts of Great Session of Wales and of the Chester Circuit_,\r\nby the late Chancellor Trevor Parkins, from which I have obtained a\r\nconsiderable amount of information, is given a list of judges and\r\nofficers of these Courts from early days to their abolition in 1830.\r\nA very important person on every Circuit was the Attorney-General,\r\nwho was appointed by the Crown, and possessed all the powers of the\r\nKing’s Attorney-General. The principal officer on each Circuit was the\r\nProthonotary, who attended on the Justices when they held their Courts,\r\nand discharged similar duties to those now performed by the Associate.\r\nHe was appointed by the Crown, and was usually Clerk of the Crown also.\r\nThe subordinate officers were a marshal, a registrar, and a crier, and\r\nthese were appointed by the Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe Chamberlain of Chester or his Deputy was the Keeper of the original\r\nSeal of Chester and Flint. At Chester, where a considerable amount of\r\nbusiness was transacted, there was a much larger bar than there was\r\non the Welsh Circuits. The Northern Circuit was strongly represented\r\nthere. John Williams, James Parke (afterwards Lord Wensleydale),\r\nJoseph Littledale, William Wightman, and Charles Crompton, all of\r\nwhom became High Court Judges, were among the members of the Northern\r\nCircuit who practised at the Chester Assizes in the early years of the\r\nlast century. David Francis Jones, for some time Recorder of Chester,\r\nbetter known as Sergeant Atcherley, and those eminent lawyers, John\r\nHoratio Lloyd and William Newland Welsby, Recorder of Chester, and\r\nlong the leader of the present Chester and North Wales Circuit, were\r\nalso members of the Chester Palatine Bar. Lord Kenyon and Chief Baron\r\nRichards, both of whom were afterwards Chief Justices of Chester, were\r\namong those who belonged to the Welsh Circuit.\r\n\r\nWe give an illustration of the old County Hall and of the Old Court\r\nof Exchequer at Chester Castle (where causes were heard), before they\r\nwere taken down and the present classical buildings, the creation of a\r\nChester architect, were erected at the close of the eighteenth century,\r\ntaken from the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ of June 1789. The Exchequer Court\r\nis said to have been the building in which the Norman Earls sat in\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nSome years after the abolition of the Palatine Courts the records\r\nrelating to them and to the County Palatine were examined, arranged,\r\nand ably reported upon by the late Mr. Black of the Public Record\r\nOffice. Efforts were made to retain these records at Chester, where\r\nit was proposed that a branch of the Public Record Office should be\r\nestablished; but ultimately in the autumn of 1854 they were removed to\r\nLondon, first of all to the Tower, and afterwards to the Public Record\r\nOffice in Chancery and Fetter Lanes.\r\n\r\nI find in Appendix 11 of the Sixteenth Report of the Deputy Keeper of\r\nthe Public Records the following:--“The records brought from Chester\r\npacked as closely as possible, filled four or five large boxes and\r\n369 bags, about 100 of the latter being large five bushel bags. The\r\nweight was nearly 13 tons. They filled five of the largest London\r\nand North-Western Railway luggage vans.” These records are being\r\ngradually cleaned and classified. The reports and calendars relating\r\nto them, which have already been published, are extremely valuable\r\nand interesting, although they only touch the very fringe of the\r\ninformation contained in such an immense mass of documents. There are\r\nno more able or courteous public servants than those in the Record\r\nOffice, but they cannot do impossibilities, and unless the staff is\r\nincreased it will be ages before the public can be informed of the\r\nentire contents of these valuable Cheshire and Welsh records. We here\r\ngive one of the entries on the Chester Recognisance Roll of the time\r\nof the Owen Glyndwr rebellion, as a sample of the entries contained in\r\nthe Deputy-Keeper’s reports:--1403 September 4.--The Mayor, Sheriffs,\r\nand Aldermen of the City of Chester are empowered and directed by Writ\r\nto “expel all Welsh from the City, both men and women, the same not\r\nto enter the City before sunrise or tarry in it after sunset, on pain\r\nof decapitation, nor presume to walk about armed, except with a knife\r\nto cut their dinner, nor to use any tavern or to hold meetings in the\r\nsame, nor any three of the said Welsh to meet together within the Walls\r\non pain of being sent to prison as rebels; and should any strangers,\r\nWelshmen, viz. from the County of Flint, or other parts of Wales, come\r\nto the said City, the same to leave their arms, &c., outside the gate\r\nby which they entered.”\r\n\r\nCamden, in speaking of Cheshire, has said “this County ever surpassed\r\nthe rest in producing nobility, nor is there any County in England\r\nthat has anciently brought more Noblemen into the field or can boast a\r\ngreater number of Knightly Families.”\r\n\r\n“Cheshire Chief of Men” is an ancient Cheshire proverb, and is used by\r\nMichael Drayton in his _Polyolbion_.\r\n\r\nWe may summarise the history of the County Palatine of Chester\r\nthus:--On its foundation and during the reigns of the Norman Earls, it\r\nassumed the form of a semi-regal state. Afterwards, on the assumption\r\nof the Earldom by the eldest sons of the Kings of England, it became\r\ntheir most ancient appanage, and at first was maintained with all its\r\nregalities. Edward I. made Chester his headquarters during his Welsh\r\nwars, and resided in the city and neighbourhood more than any other\r\nsovereign or prince has done. Subsequently the powers of the Palatinate\r\nwere gradually vested in the Crown, and finally abolished in the reign\r\nof Henry VIII., the administration of the law being all that was left\r\nof its ancient prerogatives. Finally, by the Act of 1830 this peculiar\r\njurisdiction was also taken from it, and, as we have already seen,\r\nin 1854 all its records (the muniments of its former greatness) were\r\nremoved to London.\r\n\r\nAll that remains is the name “County Palatine,” and the title it gives\r\nto the reigning monarch’s eldest son.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Old Shire Hall, Chester.\r\n\r\n(_Now pulled down._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE ABBEYS OF CHESHIRE\r\n\r\n  By the Archdeacon of Chester\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is more than possible that the title of this paper will provoke the\r\nquestion from our readers, “Where are they?” There are no beautiful\r\nand picturesque ruins like Fountains, or Tintern, or Glastonbury to\r\nbe visited, and we are compelled to go back to the period of the\r\nDissolution of the Monasteries to find out how the county was in\r\nprevious ages served and helped by religious houses. When we do this\r\nwe discover that Cheshire did not contain a large number; in short,\r\nthat there were only four counties (those of Cumberland, Westmorland,\r\nRutland, and Lancaster) and the two Welsh dioceses of St. Asaph\r\nand Bangor, which had fewer. If, however, we look at their value,\r\nCheshire took a higher place, as ten counties, in addition to the\r\nfour Welsh dioceses, were inferior to it in this respect. This was\r\ndue to the richness of the Abbey of St. Werburgh at Chester, of which\r\nthe possessions amounted to three-fifths of the whole. In fact, St.\r\nWerburgh’s, valued at £1003, was richer than Fountains (£998), nearly\r\nas rich as Ely (£1084), though considerably poorer than Reading (£1938)\r\nand St. Albans (£2102).\r\n\r\nBut when we remember the debt which we owe in the past to the\r\nmonasteries, and how they kept alive in the dark ages both education\r\nand religion, we must admit that a volume like the present would be\r\nincomplete without some account of the Abbeys which were situated\r\nin the county, even though in some cases the name only remains. The\r\ntitle also excludes foundations like St. John’s, Chester, which was\r\nfor secular canons, and another of a similar character at Bunbury.\r\nIt might also reasonably take no count of the Hospital of Little St.\r\nJohn’s, Chester, though this is included in the list given by Dugdale,\r\nno doubt because it was connected with the Abbey of Birkenhead. On\r\nits site now stand the Blue Coat School and Almshouses founded by\r\nBishop Stratford in 1700. The Abbeys mentioned by Dugdale are St.\r\nWerburgh, Chester, St. Mary’s Nunnery, Chester, and Birkenhead, which\r\nwere Benedictine; Vale Royal and Combermere, which were Cistercian;\r\nand Norton, which belonged to the Augustinian Canons. There was\r\nalso Stanlow, which was translated to Whalley, in Lancashire, A.D.\r\n1294; and, for a very short period, a Cell of Augustinian Canons at\r\nMobberley. It will be convenient to take them in the reverse order to\r\nthat in which they are here given.\r\n\r\nThe small house at Mobberley was founded in 1206 by Patrick de\r\nMobberley. He no doubt intended to establish a permanent institution,\r\nbut it came to an end at his death, as he had only a life-interest in\r\nthe estate with which he endowed it, and the fact of its having existed\r\nonly remains as an interesting feature in the history of that parish.\r\n\r\nStanlaw, or Stanlow, was an Abbey of the Cistercian Order, and was\r\nbuilt on a rocky eminence jutting out into the river Mersey where\r\nthe river Gowy joins it. Some remains of the buildings still exist.\r\nOriginally they were extensive and handsome. At the end of the\r\nthirteenth century the lands and buildings suffered severely from the\r\nencroachments of the sea and from fire, and the great body of the\r\nmonks were transferred (not without protest from several quarters) to\r\nWhalley, in Lancashire, and only six left in charge of the church and\r\nbuildings. The ruins are interesting, but are now more difficult of\r\naccess, being cut off by the Manchester Ship Canal.\r\n\r\nNorton Priory belonged to the Augustinian or Austin Canons. At the\r\nDissolution it was purchased of the King by Richard Brooke, and the\r\nproperty still remains in that family. A mansion was built on its\r\nsite, and the only relics of the monastery are to be found now in the\r\nbasement or cellar, where an old doorway may be seen, which was no\r\ndoubt part of the substructure of the religious house. It is worthy of\r\nnote that the suppression of the monastery was stoutly resisted by the\r\nAbbot or Prior and his companions, who were taken prisoners. The house\r\nstill bears the name of Norton Priory. In 1643 it was besieged by the\r\nRoyalists, who were repulsed, owing to the sturdy defence which was\r\noffered by the eighty men who were sheltered in it.\r\n\r\nCombermere Abbey is, again, only a name for the country residence\r\nbelonging to the Cotton family, but now occupied by Katharine, Duchess\r\nof Westminster. The Abbey was Cistercian, but was apparently demolished\r\nwhen the present house was built, though some fancy that traces of\r\nthe old work are to be seen in portions of the building. It was the\r\nsecond richest Abbey in Cheshire, though it did not reach in value one\r\nquarter of what St. Werburgh’s was assessed at. A cell of this Abbey\r\nwas founded in 1153 at Pulford, near Chester, by Robert, the Earl of\r\nChester’s baker, when his lord was a prisoner to King Stephen. The\r\nEarl on his release confirmed the foundation, and granted the monks a\r\nfishery in the Dee. In 1214 the cell was removed into Staffordshire on\r\naccount of the frequent incursions of the Welsh.\r\n\r\nVale Royal was another Cistercian foundation. It had an interesting\r\nhistory, and it must be a matter of regret that no remains of the\r\noriginal building are left, unless traces of the refectory are to be\r\nseen in the south wing of the residence, now the seat of Lord Delamere.\r\nIt was founded in 1277 by King Edward I., hence the title Vale Royal.\r\nOriginally the monks had a temporary home at Darnhall, and it was not\r\nuntil 1330 that they were established at Vale Royal, where £32,000\r\nhad been spent upon the buildings. Their royal patron bestowed great\r\nprivileges upon the monks, including the extensive right of advowry\r\nor protection of criminals, and the power of life and death in their\r\nmanors of Darnhall, Over, and Weaverham. We learn from some records\r\nthat have been left that the Abbots had a somewhat troubled experience,\r\nand that some of their number were decidedly warlike in their tastes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Birkehedde Priory, _in_ Cheshire.]\r\n\r\nWe come now to consider the Benedictine houses which were situated\r\nin the county. Birkenhead was not large, and was for sixteen monks,\r\nand its value was only £93. As has been stated above, it had some\r\nconnection with Chester, for the Hospital of St. John, outside the\r\nNorth Gate, was attached to it. Some remains of the Abbey are left\r\nwhich are interesting. The monks were sixteen in number, and the Abbey\r\npossessed the exclusive right of ferryage, and the name Monks’ Brow\r\nFerry still survives. The ruins consist of the refectory and Prior’s\r\napartment, and of the church. There is also a crypt with elegant\r\ngroined roof, and the chapter-house, which was used as a chapel before\r\nthe present church was built at the beginning of the last century.\r\nWashington Irving, in his _Sketch Book_, vol. i., writes: “As we sailed\r\nup the Mersey I saw the mouldering ruin of an Abbey overrun with ivy\r\nand the taper spire of a village church rising from the brow of a\r\nneighbouring hill;--all were characteristic of England.” The Hospital\r\nof St. John, Chester, was attached to the Priory, the mastership being\r\ngranted to the Prior and his successors by Edward II. The chapel and\r\nhospital were destroyed during the civil wars.\r\n\r\nSt. Mary’s Nunnery, Chester, stood in the south-west corner of the\r\ncity, and the name was retained in the title Nuns’ Gardens, and now\r\nin the newer title Nuns’ Road. Until 1840 some of the ruins existed\r\non the site, but in that year they were removed, and an arch (which\r\nmay have been part of the church) was taken to St. John’s Priory, the\r\nhouse where De Quincey once lived, and was subsequently erected in the\r\nGrosvenor Park, where it may now be seen. The arch appears to indicate\r\na building of the thirteenth century. A plan in the British Museum of\r\nthe date of Queen Elizabeth gives certain details of the buildings,\r\nand we learn from it that the dimensions of the church were 66 feet by\r\n45 feet, of the cloisters 90 feet by 60 feet, and of the chapel (no\r\ndoubt the Abbess’) 27 feet by 14 feet. We gather from other sources\r\nthat the Abbess at the Dissolution was named Elizabeth Grosvenor, and\r\nthat she retired on a pension of £20 a year; and that in 1553 thirteen\r\nnuns were still living and in receipt of pensions. In the Calendar\r\nof Patent Rolls is preserved a chartulary of the nunnery down to the\r\nyear 1400. The foundation by Randulf Gernons, Earl of Chester, dates\r\nabout the year 1150. The founder and his successors, Earl Hugh and Earl\r\nRandulf Blundeville, and many others, gave many and valuable gifts to\r\nthe nunnery, which, besides manors and landed possessions, included the\r\nright to have one boat in the water of Chester, together with one net,\r\nand the privilege of free multure of their corn for the table at the\r\nChester mills. Even more interesting than these various charters is a\r\ncopy of the processional of the nuns, preserved in the collection of\r\nthe Earl of Ellesmere, for it throws some light upon their services\r\nand on the extent of their buildings, for no fewer than twelve altars\r\nare mentioned by name. But perhaps the most interesting relic is to be\r\nfound at the end of this manuscript in a charming carol, which has been\r\nrendered into modern notation by Professor J. C. Bridge, Mus. Doc.,\r\nM.A., F.S.A., and which is occasionally sung in Chester Cathedral.\r\nThere is thus a delightful connection between the present and the past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Norman Doorway in Cloisters, Chester Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nWe now come to St. Werburgh’s Abbey, preserved to us in the present\r\nCathedral. Here, as at Gloucester, Bristol, and Peterborough, the\r\nfoundation of a new See at the dissolution of the monasteries has\r\nhad the effect of keeping for us the church of the monks, with some\r\nadjacent buildings, so that we are able to estimate in some degree\r\nwhat their Abbey was like. Here, too, in the stones of the edifice,\r\nwith its varying styles of architecture, is written a history which\r\nis well worthy of careful consideration, and which brings before us\r\nmany personages of note and importance. We have reason to believe that\r\na religious house existed on the same spot in Saxon times, though no\r\ntrace of such a building is visible; for in the year 875 the remains of\r\nSt. Werburgh were brought to Chester from Hanbury, during an incursion\r\nof the Danes, and enshrined in a church said to have been dedicated\r\nto St. Peter and St. Paul. She was the daughter of Wulfhere, King of\r\nMercia, who, according to one authority, first built the Abbey in 660.\r\nShe was a niece of St. Etheldreda, Abbess of Ely, whom she succeeded,\r\nand was herself head of establishments for nuns at Trentham, Hanbury,\r\nand elsewhere, or perhaps it would be more correct to say that her\r\nuncle Ethelred placed all the religious women in the kingdom of Mercia\r\nunder her rule. It was probably from the date of the translation of\r\nher remains to the church in Chester that the dedication was changed\r\nto St. Werburgh. A century and a half later we are told that secular\r\ncanons were established in a monastery of St. Werburgh and St. Oswald.\r\nThe buildings were repaired and enlarged by Leofric, Earl of Chester,\r\nin 1057; but in 1093 the Abbey was reconstituted, the secular canons\r\nwere banished, and a body of regulars of the Order of St. Benedict was\r\nintroduced by Hugh Lupus, the Norman Earl of Chester. In this work he\r\nwas assisted by his friend St. Anselm, then Abbot of Bec in Normandy,\r\nwhom he had invited over for that purpose. The story is that Anselm\r\nhesitated to accept the invitation lest he should be placed in the\r\nvacant chair at Canterbury. Eventually he came, and was called to fill\r\nthe primatial see. There can be no doubt that Anselm was responsible\r\nfor the planning of the Norman Church of St. Werburgh, of which\r\ndistinct traces are to be seen in the north wall of the edifice, the\r\nbasement of a north-west tower (never finished), the north transept,\r\nand the large vaulted cellar or chamber on the west side of the\r\ncloisters. Though there are no remains of Norman cloisters left, there\r\nare plain indications that the cloister garth must have coincided with\r\nthat which we have at the present day. It is a matter of considerable\r\ninterest, then, to be able to associate the name of Anselm with the\r\nAbbey in Chester, and to know that he must have been anxious in some\r\nmeasure to reproduce in England the learning for which Bec had by that\r\ntime become noted. His chaplain, Richard, became the first Abbot of\r\nthe newly founded monastery; and even the material characteristics of\r\nhis old home may be said to have been reproduced, of which evidence is\r\nfound in the strange stone roof of the apse at the end of the south\r\nchoir aisle. There was now established a body of regulars of the\r\nBenedictine Order, which was to find its home here for four hundred and\r\nfifty years. During that period the monks, as well as their buildings,\r\nwent through many vicissitudes. In 1180 a destructive fire devastated\r\nthe whole of the city, and no doubt as a consequence of this, in 1194,\r\nwe find the seventh Abbot complaining that the church was in ruins.\r\nHe was able to raise enough money wherewith to build the choir, and\r\nhis successor appears to have completed the repairs, and even to\r\nhave extended the buildings under the patronage and with the aid of\r\nEarl Randle, surnamed Blundeville. But troublous times again arose,\r\nand the Abbots had much difficulty in protecting both their property\r\nand their church. In 1265 Simon de Whitchurch became Abbot, and has\r\nleft his mark behind him in the eastern bays of the nave and in the\r\nbeautiful and elegant Lady Chapel, which is such an excellent specimen\r\nof Early English architecture. Here is to be seen some early vaulting\r\non the roof, a feature not common in the building generally, as though\r\nprovision was made by graceful shafts in the choir and elsewhere, it\r\nwas only completed in the Lady Chapel and in the aisles of the choir,\r\neither from lack of funds or for some other reason. In the groining\r\none of the bosses has a representation of the martyrdom of St. Thomas\r\nof Canterbury, and as this must have been put up only a hundred years\r\nafter his death, it shows how soon Becket attained a high position in\r\nthe estimation of his countrymen. About the same time was erected the\r\nChapter-house with its vestibule, an exquisite example of architecture\r\nas it developed from the Norman to Early English; and to the same date\r\nwe may refer the refectory with its matchless reading pulpit. The\r\nlatter building is unfortunately in a maimed condition, as one-third\r\nof it is roofless and has been separated from the rest, whilst the\r\nraising of the ground on the north side, and the erection there of some\r\nmodern houses, quite destroys the original effect of the exterior. It\r\nwould be a great and noble undertaking if this room could be carefully\r\nrestored to its proper form and proportions. Subsequent Abbots were\r\nengaged in the completion of the choir, and in the fifteenth century\r\nAbbots Simon Ripley and Birchenshaw did much to extend and enlarge\r\nthe fabric. One of the most striking features of the Abbey (now the\r\nCathedral) is the south transept, which is almost as large as the nave.\r\nThe north transept is quite small as designed by Anselm, and the south\r\ntransept was no doubt originally of the same size. When the monks\r\ndesired to extend their church by the addition of more chapels they\r\ncould not build on the north side as their other buildings occupied\r\nthat space. On the south they found a parish church, which they\r\nremoved, building another church for the parishioners on an adjoining\r\nsite. They then built the large south transept, in which were four\r\naltars in their respective chapels, the vaulting of only one being\r\nerected at the time. After about forty years the parishioners asserted\r\ntheir rights, and assumed occupation of the transept, which thereafter\r\nbecame the Parish Church of St. Oswald until 1880, when it was once\r\nmore thrown into the main building, and the partition which had\r\nseparated it was removed. Here the clerestory windows, as in the nave,\r\nare Late Perpendicular, but the tracery of the other windows gives us a\r\ngood specimen of Decorated work. The interior was restored eight years\r\nago as a worthy memorial of the late Duke of Westminster. The central\r\ntower was probably erected by these later builders, but its plainness\r\nand severity were removed when it was refaced and ornamented under the\r\ndirection of Sir Gilbert Scott. The same Abbots commenced the building\r\nof a south-western tower, which was not, however, carried higher than\r\nthe nave roof, the corresponding position on the north side being\r\noccupied by the base of Anselm’s Norman tower, which was incorporated\r\nin the Abbot’s lodgings. Before dismissing the exterior of the church,\r\nit should be noted that the Early English builders extended the Norman\r\nchurch eastwards, and added apsidal chapels to the aisles. These were\r\nremoved in Perpendicular times, and a further extension of the aisles\r\nwas made; but that on the south was taken down by Sir Gilbert Scott,\r\nand the Early English portion was restored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cloisters, Chester Cathedral.\r\n\r\n(_West Walk, showing one of the Monks’ Studies._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Norman Chamber, Chester Cathedral Cloisters.\r\n\r\n(_Secundo Aula of the Abbey._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe inherit from the monks in the interior of the church some most\r\nbeautiful and elegant woodwork in the choir stalls, with their quaint\r\nand richly carved _Misereres_ and the delicate tabernacle work with\r\nwhich they are crowned. There is probably no finer specimen in\r\nEngland, both in design and execution, and it is a matter of sincere\r\ncongratulation that it has been preserved, especially when it is\r\nremembered that the position of the stalls has been changed more than\r\nonce. The shrine of St. Werburgh, now placed at the west end of the\r\nLady Chapel, is another treasure, and was designed in the fourteenth\r\ncentury to take the place of an earlier structure. It has had a varied\r\nhistory, the lower part having been used as the base of the Bishop’s\r\nthrone for many years after the foundation of the See. It was adorned\r\nwith forty figures, richly gilded, representing ancestors or relatives\r\nof St. Werburgh.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that in monastic times the choir included one bay of\r\nthe nave, an arrangement still to be seen in some of our cathedrals.\r\nOne old fireplace is to be seen at the entrance to the north choir\r\naisle, and this was, no doubt, used for heating the obley irons with\r\nwhich the wafers were prepared for the Blessed Sacrament.\r\n\r\nThough many of the buildings of the monastery have been destroyed,\r\nsufficient are left to enable us, with the aid of a plan, made probably\r\nearly in the seventeenth century, to recall the daily life of the\r\nmonks. The cloisters are perfect in form, though the tracery of the\r\nwindows has in some instances perished, whilst the glass has altogether\r\nvanished. On the south side, rebuilt recently, and on the south part\r\nof the west side, may be seen the carrels or places where the monks\r\nstudied, two in each carrel, and hard by are the armaria or recesses\r\nwhere the books or manuscripts were kept. Close at hand is the seat\r\nwhere the librarian would have his position, ready to supply any book\r\nor material which might be wanted. At the south-west corner was the\r\nplace where youths were instructed. The floor would be strewn with hay\r\nor straw, mixed with herbs, to afford some little warmth or protection\r\nto the silent monks as they wrote and studied. The silence would be\r\nbroken now and again by the footsteps of those who were entering or\r\nleaving the church, where the offices were said; otherwise the place\r\nwould be perfectly still save for the voice of the monk instructing\r\nhis pupils. In this way would the everyday life of the religious be\r\nspent. On the north side was the refectory, where the meals were\r\nserved, and even at such times, as a rule, there would not be\r\nordinary conversation, but the monks would in order take their place\r\nin the beautiful and unique pulpit, and read out of some devotional or\r\ninstructive book for the edification of the brethren. On the eastern\r\nside was the dormitory, reached by a staircase which still exists\r\nthrough the doorway in the north-eastern corner. On the north side,\r\nin the exterior wall of the refectory, graced by a beautiful Early\r\nEnglish arcade, was the washing trough or lavatory, and we can imagine\r\nthe monks, when they had descended each morning from the dormitory,\r\nperforming here their simple ablutions. The water was conveyed in pipes\r\nfrom the neighbouring village of Christleton. On the west side was\r\nthe great hall of the Abbot’s lodgings, and underneath it a vaulted\r\nchamber, which could be entered from the cloister, and might be used as\r\nan ambulatory or place for exercise when the weather was unpropitious.\r\nIn the south-east was (and is) an ornamental doorway leading through\r\nthe vestibule to the Chapter-house, where the brethren sat in conclave\r\nto consider matters affecting the welfare of the body. Eastwards of\r\nthis was the infirmary, where the sick and aged were tended, but no\r\nremains of this building or others near it are now left. The style of\r\narchitecture of the present cloisters is Late Perpendicular, and their\r\ndate is fixed pretty accurately, for the arms of Cardinal Wolsey on\r\none of the bosses show that he must have been Archbishop of York when\r\nthey were erected. Similarly, we may add, the Cardinal’s arms are to\r\nbe seen on the flat oak roof of the north transept, the only portion\r\nof the church where no provision was made for groining. Another boss\r\nin the cloisters bears the initials of Thomas Marshall, who was Abbot\r\nfor a few months in 1529. But though the present cloisters are of this\r\nlate date, there is little doubt that they are only the successors of\r\nearlier ones. In fact, the Early English decoration above the lavatory\r\nseems to indicate that cloisters in that style had existed, whilst the\r\nlate Mr. Parker, in 1857, gave it as his opinion that “there was an\r\nearly cloister even at the Norman period.” The cloister garth, in the\r\nplan to which reference has been made, is called “the sprise garden.”\r\nThis is wrongly interpreted as “a corruption of Paradise or the\r\nChurchyard.” The enclosure was not meant to be used as a burying-place,\r\nthough interments did take place in some of the cloister walks. But the\r\ntitle probably indicated that here were grown those aromatic shrubs\r\nwhich the monks would require for their fragrance or for medical\r\npurposes. Just outside the city walls, which bounded the monastic\r\nproperty on the east, was their vegetable garden, as is indicated\r\nby the title which the place still bears, “the Kale-yard.” Here the\r\nbrethren would be able to engage in out-door operations, and to\r\nobtain that exercise which would be so necessary for the preservation\r\nof health. Other opportunities of service would be afforded within\r\nthe enclosure, which was a fairly large one, for it contained “the\r\nbrewhouse and storehouses, the great kiln and drying floors,” besides\r\nall the offices necessary for so large an establishment. It was\r\nentered through two gateways, the one for general use, the other for\r\ncartage and purposes of that kind. Both openings still remain, and\r\nare known by the name of “the Abbey Gateway” and “the little Abbey\r\nGateway.” The superstructure of the former was unfortunately altered\r\nand modernised early in the nineteenth century, but the gateway itself,\r\nwith its groined roof and finely-carved bosses, is well worthy of close\r\ninspection by the visitor. The gates have, of course, disappeared, but\r\nthe larger arch for the admission of vehicles and the smaller doorway\r\nfor pedestrians give us a clear indication of the way the entrance was\r\nused. The porter’s lodge was on the southern side, and you can still\r\nsee traces of the doorway of it and of the window through which the\r\nporter would make his observations. It was before this gateway that the\r\nChester Mystery Plays were first represented before they were taken\r\nround the city, and thus had ecclesiastical as well as civic patronage\r\nand support. Before this gateway, too, was held a fair or market,\r\nabout which certain disputes arose between the monks and the citizens\r\nwhich were finally settled in 1488.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Doorway in Cloisters, Chester Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nOf the Abbot’s dwelling, converted at the Dissolution and foundation of\r\nthe See of Chester into the Bishop’s Palace, some few but interesting\r\nremains are still extant. For instance, the basement of the projected\r\nnorth-west Norman tower was, according to the plan in the British\r\nMuseum, the wine cellar. It was reached by a spiral staircase from\r\nthe room above, which was probably the Abbot’s private apartment, and\r\nbecame the Bishop’s study, obtaining its light from a fan-light in\r\nthe ceiling. On the north of this was the Abbot’s chapel, which was\r\na Norman building, and entered from his room by a fine doorway. This\r\nagain was used by the Bishop, and in Bishop Bridgman’s time had a\r\nJacobean chancel added to it. The chapel is in a somewhat dilapidated\r\ncondition, and is approached from the church by the above-mentioned\r\nstaircase. “The wine cellar” and the room above have been thrown into\r\nthe Cathedral, and now form the baptistery, and in it is a beautiful\r\nfifth-century font of Italian origin, which was given by the late Earl\r\nEgerton of Tatton in 1885. From “the wine cellar” a square-headed\r\ndoorway, now filled up, led into “the pantry,” and beyond this was\r\n“the strong-beer cellar.” It is possible that the names given to these\r\napartments simply indicate the purpose to which they were put when the\r\nBishop’s Palace was here, and that they have no reference to the use\r\nmade of them in monastic times. But they were, at any rate, part of the\r\nAbbey buildings. “The strong-beer cellar,” with its graceful columns\r\nand vaulted roof, has been restored by the Dean and Chapter, and is\r\nnow known as “the vaulted chamber,” and is most useful for lectures\r\nand meetings. The Abbot probably, like the Bishop, was able to come\r\ndown into the church without going into the open air; at any rate, the\r\nlatter could do this.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey had certain small houses or dependencies in the\r\nneighbourhood. To such houses the title Grange was often applied,\r\nand Saighton Grange, the residence of the Right Honourable George\r\nWyndham and Countess Grosvenor, was such an appanage of St. Werburgh’s\r\nAbbey. The present building was only a portion, probably the gateway,\r\nof the original structure. At Ince was another, and here again some\r\ninteresting remains are to be seen, though they have been converted\r\ninto cottages and for agricultural uses. A small number of monks no\r\ndoubt always resided at such places, and generally had charge of the\r\nservices in the church. The other brethren might seek change of scene\r\nand air by occasional visits. The Granges would also be necessary\r\nfor the storage of the crops, which could not be carried into the\r\ncity, and at Ince the large barn used for this purpose is still to be\r\nseen. When we remember the frequently unsettled state of the country,\r\nespecially on the Welsh borders, we are not surprised to learn that\r\nin 1499 permission was given to the Abbot to fortify the Granges at\r\nInce, Saighton, and Sutton, so that protection might be afforded to the\r\nresidents and to the movable property of which they were custodians.\r\nBoth at Ince and Saighton we may see traces of the work which was then\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey of St. Werburgh cannot claim amongst her sons men of such\r\ndistinction as the Venerable Bede, the monk of Jarrow; but Ralph\r\nHigden, a lay brother, who died in 1363, may be mentioned as a writer\r\nof some distinction. He was the author of _Polychronicon_, a record\r\nof events from the Creation to his own time. It is in seven books,\r\nand compiled from various authorities, and, though not free from\r\ninaccuracies, is a surprising work considering the age in which it\r\nwas written. Bishop Creighton says that the work enjoyed unexampled\r\npopularity, and was schemed with a completeness never known before.\r\nIt stands out as a memorial of the patient study and research which\r\noften characterised the lives of the dwellers in our monasteries, and\r\nmay thus help us to realise how much we owe to their labours in the\r\npreservation of our history and literature. Higden’s tomb may still be\r\nseen in the south choir aisle.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been already said, it will readily be admitted that we\r\nowe a deep debt to those monks of old for the loving care and artistic\r\nskill which they lavished on the Houses of God, and for the patient\r\nlabour whereby they preserved for future ages our literature, both\r\necclesiastical and secular. The services, too, in many a parish were\r\nmaintained by them, and it is hardly too much to say that the lamp of\r\nreligion would have been utterly darkened in many a place, if it had\r\nnot been kept alight by the teaching and preaching of those who had\r\ntheir home in the monasteries. Nor must we forget, what has already\r\nbeen hinted at, that the monks were virtually the only--at any rate\r\nthe chief--instructors of the youth of the country, and thus did much\r\nfor the education and elevation of the people. They, too, were the\r\nprincipal almoners of the poor, who must have suffered acutely when\r\nthe monasteries were suppressed. In all these different ways there is\r\nno reason to doubt that the Abbeys of Cheshire (and especially the\r\ncomparatively wealthy one of St. Werburgh’s) did their part and share\r\nfor the benefit of those around them, and, like similar institutions\r\nelsewhere, did much to inspire and preserve a high and noble ideal\r\nof Christian life. This is not the occasion or the place to discuss\r\nfully the great question of the suppression of the monasteries, or the\r\nmotives of those who were responsible for it, and the means which they\r\nadopted for the purpose. But the candid student of history, unless he\r\nbe very bigoted, cannot but admit that the measure was characterised\r\nby some very questionable acts, and marked by deeds which cannot be\r\ndefended. The reformation of the religious houses--or of such as needed\r\nsuch treatment--could probably have effected all that was necessary,\r\nand have been more beneficial to the country at large. The monasteries\r\nmight have adapted themselves to the changed circumstances and to\r\nthe growing needs of the age. At any rate there need not have been\r\nthat terrible and needless waste shown in the wanton destruction of\r\ncountless treasures of art and learning, whereby opportunities for the\r\nimprovement of man were deliberately thrown away. Not to mention the\r\nreliquaries and church plate, which were unscrupulously seized and\r\ndesecrated, books and manuscripts of priceless value were destroyed,\r\npainted windows broken, hospitals and schools closed, buildings\r\nunroofed, and suffered to fall into ruin, and to become a mere quarry\r\nfor the neighbourhood. In these various ways no doubt Cheshire suffered\r\nmuch like the rest of England; but the preservation of the Abbey of St.\r\nWerburgh as the future Cathedral of the newly founded See of Chester,\r\nrendered the loss much less than it would otherwise have been. Still\r\nit was sufficiently great, though it is not possible now fully to\r\nestimate it. All that was left to the Church from the Dissolution of\r\nthe monasteries were the six poorly-endowed bishoprics, Westminster,\r\nOxford, Chester, Gloucester, Bristol, and Peterborough, and of these\r\nWestminster was appropriated by the Crown in 1550.\r\n\r\nThough not strictly comprised in the title of this paper, perhaps\r\nmention ought to be made of the other religious houses which were\r\nunder the friars. Of these there were three in the city of Chester,\r\nall in one quarter, the record of the fact being still preserved in\r\nthe names of three streets, Whitefriars, Blackfriars, and Greyfriars.\r\nThese represent respectively the three orders, the Carmelites,\r\nthe Dominicans, and the Franciscans. The only remains of these\r\nestablishments are to be found in certain walls, which, if not the\r\nactual boundary walls, have been evidently erected with stones from the\r\nbuildings. Whitefriars possessed a church with a steeple, erected in\r\n1496, “of great height and beauty.” An old annalist records that “in\r\n1597 the Whitefreeres Steeple, curiously wrought, was taken downe, and\r\na faire house built there by Sir Thomas Egerton, Knight, Lord-keeper:\r\na great pitie that the steeple was put away, being a great ornament to\r\nthe citie. This curious spire steeple might still have stood for grace\r\nto the city, had not private benefit, the devourer of antiquitie,\r\npulled it down with the church, and erected a house for more commodity,\r\nwhich since hath been of little use, so that the city hath lost so\r\ngoodly an ornament that tymes hereafter may more talk of it, being the\r\nonly sea-mark for direction over the bar of Chester.” The quotation\r\n(which is from Harleian MS. No. 2125) is not without interest,\r\nespecially in its condemnation of the destruction of historical\r\nbuildings for merely utilitarian purposes. At the Dissolution the\r\nWhitefriars had a prior, sub-prior, and eight brethren. The other\r\nhouses were no doubt also small, and, of course, in accordance with\r\ntheir tenets, there was little or no property beyond the buildings\r\nwhich constituted their home. The retention of the names in the streets\r\nmentioned above may occasionally induce thinking men to consider what\r\nwe owe to the friars. If the monk withdrew from the world, the friar\r\nplunged into its busiest haunts. The one used the weapon of prayer\r\nand intercession, the other went as a missionary among men. The one\r\nkept alive the lamp of learning, and wrote or preserved for future\r\ngenerations literature which otherwise would have been lacking. The\r\nother brought the influence of religion into the daily common life of\r\nmankind. To both we of the present day owe a debt of gratitude; and\r\nour consideration of the Abbeys of Cheshire ought not to be limited to\r\nrecalling the nature and number of the fabrics, without some thought of\r\nthe labour of those who inhabited them, and of the heritage which they\r\nhave passed on to us.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be mentioned that when the See of Chester was founded, the\r\ndedication of the church was altered, and the Abbey of St. Werburgh was\r\nconstituted the cathedral church of the diocese by the name of “The\r\nCathedral Church of Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary in Chester.” We\r\nmay regret the change, though there is still one church in the diocese\r\ndedicated to the daughter of Wulfhere, that of St. Werburgh, Warburton\r\n(or Werburgh town).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHESHIRE CASTLES\r\n\r\n  By the Archdeacon of Chester\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering that Cheshire lies on the border of Wales, and bearing in\r\nmind the frequent incursions made in early days by the inhabitants\r\nof the Principality, we should expect to find in the county, or, at\r\nany rate, in the portion opposed to these attacks, many fortified\r\nbuildings or castles. Such, however, is not the case. There are few\r\nexamples of ancient castles to attract the attention of the resident\r\nor the traveller, and we have nothing approaching in size or interest\r\nthe magnificent pile of Warwick. That the borderland was guarded and\r\nprotected by numerous fortifications is quite true, but, as will be\r\nseen, most of these have disappeared entirely, leaving behind them only\r\nthe name, with little or no traces above ground of the buildings which\r\nonce were there, and which played no unimportant part in the history,\r\nnot of the county only, but of the nation. It may be well to look at\r\nthese, with special reference to their origin and purpose as works of\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nLooking, then, at that part of Cheshire which is adjacent to Wales, we\r\nshall find that a close and strong line of forts was established in\r\nvery early days. The estuary of the Dee formed a sufficient protection\r\nin itself for the Wirral until Shotwick was reached, and as this place\r\nat one time was not only a port of departure for Ireland, but also\r\nafforded a landing for a crossing from Flintshire, it was natural that\r\nit should be selected as a site of a castle. Then, following the course\r\nof the Dee upwards, we have first, as was to be expected, a strong\r\ncastle at Chester, which also had the protection of its ancient walls.\r\nAbove the city, and on the other side of the river, there were castles\r\nof varying size and construction at Dodleston, Aldford, Pulford,\r\nShocklach, Malpas, and Oldcastle. A second and inner line of defence\r\nwould be furnished by castles at Beeston, Maiden Castle on the Broxton\r\nHills, Newhall in Audlem parish, and Nantwich; whilst a third line, and\r\none protecting attacks from the Mersey and its tributary the Weaver,\r\nincluded Runcorn, Halton, and Rocksavage, Frodsham and Northwich, with\r\nThelwall and Dunham Massey higher up still. It must not be supposed,\r\nhowever, that all these date from the same period, or could always be\r\nused at one and the same time to resist attacks. They are mentioned\r\nthus as showing their disposition over the county.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Shotwick Castle.\r\n\r\n(_Now destroyed._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt will readily be understood that around these different spots, events\r\nof great interest and of lasting consequence have centred, and that\r\nthey have witnessed many things which, if they could now be rescued\r\nfrom oblivion, would add points of supreme importance to the memorials\r\nof Old Cheshire. We can only here give very slight indications of their\r\nhistory, but even these may not be without some result, especially\r\nif it leads people to make further inquiries and investigations for\r\nthemselves. It may be well first to give some information as to those\r\nwhich have entirely disappeared, and then to turn to those which are\r\nstill in evidence by the remains which exist. Shotwick must, from its\r\nsituation, already indicated, have been a position of considerable\r\nimportance. Although portions of it were standing in Leland’s time,\r\nnothing but the mounds which mark its site are to be seen. Its walls\r\nhave all disappeared, though the ruins remained in 1622, and, according\r\nto Lysons, “the stones were carried way to repair roads within the\r\nmemory of man”! It received several royal visitors. Henry II. is said\r\nto have lodged here on his way to and from Ireland, and King Edward\r\nI. was here in 1278. A plan and sketch of the castle are in the\r\nBritish Museum in the Harleian MSS., from which it appears that it\r\nwas pentagonal in form, with several circular towers enclosing a lofty\r\nsquare one. Of Dodleston, Aldford, and Pulford nothing but the sites\r\nremain, though in the two former the earthworks, which include about\r\nan acre in each case, are visible. The same may be said of Shocklach,\r\nwhich was said to have been burnt by the Welsh in 1121. This occupied a\r\nmoated site near Castleton Bridge (deriving its name from the castle),\r\nadjoining a small stream. Hanshall gives rough sketch-plans of all\r\nthese, and tells us that at Shocklach the keep was 22 feet in height.\r\nIt is more remarkable that we have no remains left of Malpas, though\r\nthe site of the keep is seen near the church, for here one of Hugh\r\nLupus’s Barons had his seat, and we might have imagined that some\r\nportion of the building would have been preserved. Oldcastle, again, is\r\na name only. This also is in Malpas parish. The castle is said to have\r\nbeen burnt by the Welsh at the same time that Shocklach was destroyed.\r\nIn 1565 not a vestige of its walls remained. On Oldcastle Heath the\r\nRoyalist forces were defeated in 1644.\r\n\r\nNantwich Castle was in ruins before the reign of Henry VII., when\r\nthe stones were removed and made use of for the purpose of enlarging\r\nthe south transept of the church, which was called Kingsley’s aisle.\r\nNewhall was in the parish of Audlem and not far from Nantwich, and was\r\nalso destroyed by the Welsh, probably at the same time as Shocklach\r\nand Oldcastle. Leland, in his _Itinerary_, speaks of “Newhaull Tower,\r\nwhere there be motes and fair water.” Maiden Castle was an old\r\nBritish fortification on the Broxton Hills, and defended the pass\r\nbetween Bickerton Hill and Raw Head. It commanded a most extensive\r\nand magnificent prospect. On the south-west side it was protected by\r\na precipice, whilst on the other side the earthworks formed a perfect\r\nsemi-circle, and outside this was a ditch 15 yards wide. The only\r\nentrance was on the north side. The site is now covered by heather.\r\nThere was probably no building of any kind, the fortification being\r\ncomposed entirely of mounds of earth. At Runcorn, according to the\r\nchronicler Higden, a castle was founded in 915 by Ethelfleda, but of\r\nthis no remains are preserved. The rock on which it stood was called\r\nthe Castle Rock, and had evidently been used for purposes of defence. A\r\ndescription derived from a resident was given in Hanshall’s _Cheshire_,\r\nwith a sketch of the Castle Rock and the supposed plan of the castle.\r\nIts position at what is called Runcorn Gap was evidently a strong one.\r\nA little later, that is in 920, Edward the Elder built a tower and\r\ncastle “at Thelwall,” so called, says Leycester, “from the stakes and\r\nstumps cut from the trees, wherewith it was environed about as a wall;\r\nand King Edward made it a garrison.” Nothing is now left to indicate\r\nits position. On the Overton Hills at Frodsham, again, was a castle,\r\nwhere it is supposed that Randle Blundeville, Earl of Chester, resided\r\nin the early part of the thirteenth century, several of the charters\r\ngranted by him being signed at that place. In 1654 the castle, which\r\nhad probably been built on the foundations of the earlier building,\r\nwas completely destroyed, the dead body of the owner, Earl Rivers,\r\nbeing discovered in the ruins. It is said that the building was of\r\nstone, with walls of immense thickness, and in the Norman style of\r\narchitecture. A view of some small remains is to be found in Buck’s\r\n_Antiquities_ in 1727. At Northwich, we learn from the Harleian MSS.,\r\nthere was “a very stronge castell on the top of a verie high hill.”\r\nHere again the name only is left behind, that portion of the town where\r\nit was situated being now called Castle Northwich, as it was once\r\nknown as Castleton. From old documents we gather that there was an old\r\ncastle at Dunham Massey before the present residence was built there:\r\nfor Walter of Coventry records that “Haimo de Masci held the castles\r\nof Dunham and of Ullerwell.” In the description given by Dr. Ormerod\r\nof the modern house in imitation of Italian architecture, we are told\r\nthat “it stood within gardens laid out in the stiff taste of the time,\r\nand surrounded by an ample moat, in the angle of which is a _large\r\ncircular mound_ with a modern summer-house on the top of it.” It has\r\nbeen suggested that, from its form and situation, the mound was “the\r\nlast relic of Haimo’s Castle, and, like similar mounds in the other\r\ncastles of Cheshire, the site of the Norman keep.”\r\n\r\nWe come now to consider the castles of which we have some remains.\r\nRocksavage Castle is not one of the ancient ones, for it was built by\r\nSir John Savage, who died in 1597. It cannot therefore claim anything\r\nlike the interest which attaches to the others. It was, in fact, a\r\nmansion rather than a fortress, just as we have the title given to\r\nother seats in the county, as Bolesworth Castle and Cholmondeley\r\nCastle. It occupied, however, a striking position, and it is to be\r\nregretted that so little of it now remains. It has been converted to\r\nagricultural purposes, and the stones have doubtless been used in the\r\nconstruction of other useful buildings. What was in 1640 described\r\nas a magnificent fabric is now a shapeless ruin, with no trace of\r\nits former glories. And glories it had, for in 1607 James I. and his\r\ntrain were entertained here, and his Majesty killed a buck in Halton\r\nPark. The property descended through the female line to the Marquis of\r\nCholmondeley, and gives the title to the eldest son, who is called Earl\r\nRocksavage.\r\n\r\nClose to Rocksavage is Halton, which stands in an even more commanding\r\nposition, its very name being said to imply as much, as meaning a town\r\non a hill. The castle was probably built soon after the Conquest, as\r\nthe barony was given by Lupus, the second Earl of Chester, to his\r\ncousin Nigel. Notwithstanding its situation, which rendered it a\r\nstrong and important military post, no great historical event can be\r\nassociated with it. The neighbourhood was indeed much infested with\r\ngangs of robbers at an early period, and in the reign of Edward II.\r\nthese freebooters became so bold as actually to steal armour from the\r\ncastle itself.[4] Piers Plowman has the following as a proverb locally\r\nallusive:--\r\n\r\n                        “Thoro the pas of Haulton\r\n    Poverte might pass whith oute peril of robbinge.”\r\n\r\n [4] From Hanshall’s _Cheshire_.\r\n\r\nIn the Civil Wars the castle was occasionally occupied by both parties,\r\nand in August 1644 the Parliamentary forces were in possession.\r\nSubsequently it became a prison for debtors for the honour of Halton.\r\nBut though no account has come down to us of the castle having ever\r\nsustained a siege, it has interest for us from its connection with\r\nroyalty. “Old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster,” was Baron of\r\nHalton, and when his son, Henry Bolingbroke, became King, the barony\r\npassed to the Crown. The King has the title of Baron of Halton as well\r\nas that of Duke of Lancaster. Three halmote courts were held here\r\nyearly, and one is still held annually of which an account is given in\r\nanother paper in this volume. There are now few remains of the ancient\r\nbuildings. The Survey in Cromwell’s time describes them as being very\r\nruinous. The gate-house has been altered or rebuilt and is now the\r\nCastle Inn, and is a picturesque building, and contains a room where\r\nthe courts for the honour are held. The honour had jurisdiction over\r\nthirty-seven townships in Cheshire and over several in Lancashire. The\r\nrecords of this court are preserved, and give interesting information,\r\nwhilst a paper read in 1858 by the late Mr. William Beamont of\r\nWarrington before the Chester Archæological Society contained many\r\nparticulars as to the castle and its owners and its history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Beeston Castle.]\r\n\r\nBeeston Castle affords a most striking object to the traveller as he\r\njourneys from Chester to Crewe. It stands on a rocky insulated hill,\r\nrising in a regular and steep slope which terminates in a precipice.\r\nIt was built by Ralph Blundeville, sixth Earl of Chester, “after he\r\nwas come from the Holie Land,” and is of irregular form, with a wall\r\nand eight round towers after the style introduced by the Crusaders.\r\nThe upper ward occupies something less than an acre. The outer court\r\nincludes a considerable space of ground, and is of an irregular shape,\r\nwith several round towers. The keep is surrounded with a deep ditch,\r\ncut in the solid rock. The entrance was defended by two circular\r\ntowers, still remaining, and the moat was crossed by a drawbridge. The\r\napproach under the gateway is very narrow, by rugged steps cut out\r\nof the natural rock. In the inner court is the draw-well, perfect,\r\nbut now quite dry. It was emptied by directions of the late Lord\r\nTollemache, and found to be 366 feet in depth. It contained nothing\r\nbut rubbish, although stories were current of valuable treasures which\r\nhad in bygone times been hidden there. The position of the castle is\r\nremarkable, and very similar to that of Edinburgh Castle, though the\r\nplateau there is much more extensive. The precipitous rocks on three\r\nsides seem to render it impregnable, but these cliffs were climbed by\r\nCaptain Sandford, a devoted Royalist, with eight of his firelocks, on\r\nDecember 13, 1643. The castle bore its part in the Barons’ War. In\r\n1237 Henry III., before possessing himself of the Earldom of Chester\r\non the death of John Scot, the last of the local Earls, seized on the\r\ncastle, together with that of Chester, and placed it in the hands of\r\nCommissioners. In 1256 Prince Edward inspected the fortress, and put\r\nit and the Castles of Chester, Dissard, Schotewyke, and Vaenor in the\r\ncharge of Fulco de Orreby, Justice of Chester. In 1264 the partisans\r\nof Simon de Montfort took possession of it, but in the following year\r\nit was recovered for the royal Earl. In 1399 King Richard III., just\r\nbefore he was dethroned, made it the repository of his treasure, which\r\nwas subsequently transferred to Chester; but on Bolingbroke’s advance\r\nit was abandoned by him. In 1406 the castle was given to the Duke of\r\nYork. Eighty years later Leland describes the fortress as being in a\r\nstate of ruin, and so it remained until the Civil Wars, when it was\r\nput in a state of defence by a party of three hundred Roundheads in\r\nFebruary 1642. From this time, until it was dismantled after the siege\r\nof Chester, it had many vicissitudes, falling into the hands of one\r\nparty or the other, as is set forth in another paper in this volume.\r\nA contemporary writer gives the following description of its final\r\nsurrender to the Parliamentarians on 16th November 1645: “After having\r\nsustained a siege of eighteen weeks, the garrison of fifty-six soldiers\r\nwas driven to the greatest extremity, and had to surrender. Neither\r\nmeat nor drink was found in the castle, but only a piece of turkey pie,\r\nand a live peacock and peahen.” Sir William Brereton magnanimously made\r\na treaty with the brave Royalist Governor of the castle, “that he and\r\nhis men should be allowed to march from the castle with their arms,\r\ncolours flying and drums beating, with two cartloads of goods, and be\r\nconducted with a convoy to guard them to Flint Castle. Twenty of the\r\nsoldiers laid down their arms and craved liberty to go to their own\r\nhomes, which was granted.” Such an incident as this must awaken many\r\nmemories as we gaze upon this ancient fortress. Now it rises up on its\r\nrocky promontory out of a fertile and grassy plain, presenting in its\r\nruined walls a striking contrast to the scene below. A recent writer\r\nhas said of it: “Excepting Warwick Castle there is perhaps no more\r\ninteresting relic of feudal power in England than we behold in this\r\nfamous and far-seen ruin.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Gateway, Chester Castle.\r\n\r\n(_Now pulled down._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe come last of all to the Castle of Chester. It is almost certain\r\nthat the site occupied by it was outside the walls of the original\r\nRoman city, and may have been included in them either by later Roman\r\nbuilders, or when the city was repaired, enlarged, and beautified by\r\nthat great builder, Ethelfleda, the daughter of King Alfred, in 907.\r\nAt any rate the erection of the first Castle of Chester may safely be\r\nattributed to her. Though no trace of the work exists in Saxon masonry,\r\nit is fairly certain that the inner or upper bailey stands upon the\r\nearthworks thrown up by her, whilst the line of ditch that belonged to\r\nthe mound on which the flag-tower stood may still be discerned. In\r\n1894 the late Mr. E. W. Cox was permitted by the commanding officer to\r\nmake a minute examination of the modern buildings on the west side of\r\nthe court. He satisfied himself that the lower storey of the flag-tower\r\nstill existed enclosed within modern work, and that this was indeed the\r\nbase of the Norman keep. This is the only evidence of Norman masonry\r\nhaving been erected on the site, and Mr. Cox formed the opinion that\r\nany other work of that period may have been of timber, often used by\r\nthose early builders, as proved at Montgomery, Shrewsbury, Deganwy,\r\nand other places. We come now to the mediæval work, of which we have a\r\nportion preserved to us in the Julian Tower, beside the walls on the\r\nsouth and west. This tower is of three storeys, each room being vaulted\r\nin stone, the centre one having been the chapel. This is about 16 feet\r\nhigh, and the groins spring from slender pillars with capitals in the\r\nstyle of the thirteenth century. James II. heard Mass in this chapel on\r\n27th August 1687. The building has for some time been used for storage.\r\nSome years ago traces of sacred paintings were found on the walls, but\r\nthey have now entirely disappeared. A plan and sketch of the castle,\r\nmade in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, is in the British Museum. This\r\ngives us in the lower court the noble hall called Hugh Lupus’ Hall,\r\nwhich was taken down about the year 1790. It was 90 feet long by 45 in\r\nbreadth, and the roof was supported by woodwork carved in a bold style\r\nand resting on brackets. Adjoining this was the Exchequer, said to have\r\nbeen the Parliament House of the Earls of Chester. All these and the\r\nother buildings were swept away, and their place taken by the Assize\r\nCourts and County Buildings in the Grecian style of architecture. On\r\neither side of the square are now the quarters for the soldiers, a\r\ndepôt of the Cheshire Regiment being quartered here. The County Prison,\r\nerected at the same time on the ground below between the castle and\r\nthe river, has been removed. Although the remains of the old castle\r\nare so slight, we are able from early drawings and prints to gather\r\nwhat it was like, and can thus form some idea of the loss, from a\r\npicturesque point of view at any rate, which the city sustained when it\r\nwas deemed necessary to erect the present buildings.\r\n\r\nBut although the ancient buildings have gone, we may still call to mind\r\nsome of the many historic scenes which have been enacted on the spot.\r\nWe may picture to ourselves the warrior princess Ethelfleda, Alfred’s\r\ndaughter, resolved that Waste Chester should be a waste Chester no\r\nlonger, raising up from the old ruinous heaps new fortifications,\r\nand enclosing within them a wider area, and erecting here within the\r\nre-arranged walls the earliest fort or castle. We can recall the\r\nstirring times of the Norman Earls, when the castle, much strengthened\r\nfrom the simple fort of Ethelfleda’s time, was a valuable bulwark\r\nand rallying-point, especially in the frequent inroads of the Welsh.\r\nHere, too, Henry II. must have spent some time, when he was putting\r\nthe Flintshire castles in order, before he set sail for Ireland from\r\nShotwick. King John was in Chester, and presumably at the castle, in\r\n1212, and left the city “an outlaw to all Christendom,” to fight his\r\nrebellious barons. Chester and its castle played a prominent part in\r\nthe stirring times that followed, and could tell of visits paid by\r\nHenry III. and Simon Montfort and others. Henry took over the earldom,\r\nthe succession of the Norman earls having failed, which ever since has\r\nbeen a royal appanage. Edward I., first as Prince and afterwards as\r\nKing, was here again and again; and with his Queen Eleanor attended\r\na service of thanksgiving for his subjugation of Wales on May 26,\r\n1293. In 1301 the castle was the scene of a grand ceremony, when the\r\nformal homage of the freeholders of Wales was paid to Prince Edward of\r\nCarnarvon, who was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester at the\r\nfamous Parliament of Lincoln. Richard II. was here in 1394 on his way\r\nto Ireland, and again in 1396 when he granted Charter 22, and in the\r\nfollowing year was a prisoner, and was lodged in the donjon in the\r\ntower over the great outer gateway of the castle opposite Gloverstone,\r\nbefore he signed his abdication. It would, however, be impossible in\r\nthe space at our disposal to give a list, much less an account, of all\r\nthe royal visits paid to this historic place, or a description of the\r\nnotable events which have transpired here. The castle opened its gates\r\nto receive both Henry VI. and Henry VII. and their Queens; whilst of\r\nthe Stuarts, James I., Charles I., and James II. in their turn came to\r\nthe place, and some of these visits were historical. Our late Queen,\r\nwhose statue, erected as a memorial of her Jubilee, adorns the Castle\r\nSquare, passed its entrance in October 1832, when she accompanied her\r\nmother the Duchess of Kent, and as Princess Victoria opened the new\r\nGrosvenor Bridge over the Dee.\r\n\r\nThen, the Shire Hall, within the castle enclosure, was the place\r\nwhere the Parliament of the Principality met, and we can imagine the\r\nproceedings which went on there, when the affairs of the county were\r\ndiscussed and managed. For we must remember that it was only in the\r\nreign of Henry VIII., in 1543, that the county received summons to send\r\ntwo knights and the city two citizens to Parliament. Until that time\r\nthe county was an independent jurisdiction. His predecessor, Henry\r\nVII., had separated the City from the county, under the title of “The\r\nCounty and City of Chester,” so that the city is a county in itself.\r\nCuriously enough, the castle is not in the city but in the county; and\r\nsome amusement might be caused by a statement of the difficulties which\r\nhave sometimes arisen through conflicting police jurisdiction. Chester\r\nCastle, then, though but little is left of its ancient buildings, may\r\nawaken memories in the minds of the men of Cheshire and of England\r\ngenerally. They may acknowledge that it has witnessed many stirring\r\nscenes, and that it has taken its share in the defence of our country,\r\nand in that long line of memorable events which have made England what\r\nshe is, and her children proud of bearing the name of Englishmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE TIMBER-FRAMED CHURCHES OF CHESHIRE\r\n\r\n  By the Rev. Dr. Cox, LL.D., F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough in any survey of timber-work in the old churches of England,\r\nEssex in one sense stands out clearly first in the number and\r\nimportance of the fabrics wherein wood is more or less freely used,\r\nin another sense Cheshire, so justly celebrated for the beauty and\r\nfrequency of its half-timbered houses, both small and great, has a\r\nclaim to the first position. One or two other counties can point to\r\na single old church or chapel almost entirely of timber framing, but\r\nCheshire is the only county which still possesses several.\r\n\r\nBy far the best known example of such Cheshire churches is that of\r\nNether or Lower Peover, which was formerly a chapel of the large parish\r\nof Great Budworth. It was probably always a timber building, as it\r\nstill remains, save for a substantial western tower of stone which\r\ndates from Elizabethan days. There was certainly a chapel there prior\r\nto 1269, for in that year it was agreed between the prior and convent\r\nof Norton (who held the church of Budworth and lands in Peover) and\r\nRichard Grosvenor and other parishioners of Nether Peover, that the\r\npriory should find them a secular chaplain to say mass in their chapel\r\nevery Sunday and Wednesday throughout the year, and on Christmas Day\r\nand all the leading festivals, as well as on St. Oswald’s Day, in\r\nwhose honour the chapel had been founded. The parishioners were also\r\nto have liberty of baptism in their chapel, provided they could obtain\r\nleave from the mother church of Budworth. The parishioners were to\r\nfind books, vestments, vessels, and other ornaments of the church at\r\ntheir own cost. Baptismal rights for this parochial chapelry were not,\r\nhowever, gained until the year 1331, when Bishop Roger de Norbury\r\ngranted to the inhabitants of the hamlet of Peover the use of a font\r\n(Lichfield Diocesan Registers, ii. f. 25).\r\n\r\nIn the original edition of Ormerod’s _Cheshire_ (1819) it is stated\r\nthat it appears from the register book of Peover that the tower was\r\nbuilt of stone in 1582, “John Bowden being then master of the work.”\r\nIt is added that “the two out-isles on either side of the chappel have\r\nbeen enlarged by the parishioners in late ages.”\r\n\r\nThe present church is usually spoken of as the best example of a timber\r\nchurch now extant; but this is scarcely the case, for it underwent a\r\nvigorous restoration, accompanied by a considerable rebuilding of the\r\nouter walls, at the hands of Mr. Salvin in 1851-52. An account of this\r\nbuilding, written shortly before the restoration, states that “The\r\nchurch is divided from the side aisles by four wooden arches on each\r\nside, formed by rude beams of wood springing from wooden pillars, from\r\nwhich, again, spring other spars, forming an obtuse arch over the nave.\r\nThe principal part of the exterior is formed of timber and plaster,\r\nwhich presents a most picturesque appearance.” Although the substantial\r\ntimber framing, stained black, with the filling-up of white plaster,\r\nis almost entirely new, Mr. Salvin found the inner arcade work, just\r\ndescribed, for the most part sound, and little more was done to it than\r\nthe clearing away of several coats of whitewash. In an interesting\r\naccount of the unrestored church by Rev. W. H. Massie, written about\r\n1850, which appeared in the first volume of the Cheshire Archæological\r\nand Historical Society, it is stated that the mouldings of some of\r\nthe window mullions, and more especially the ogee heads of doorways,\r\npointed unmistakably to the erection of the timber church, as it then\r\nstood, in the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe restoration under Mr. Salvin included the removal of a western\r\ngallery and certain eighteenth-century sash windows and brick walling\r\non the south side. Prior, too, to this restoration, the church was\r\nroofed with a flat debased ceiling covering the whole of the area.\r\nThis ceiling was removed, and the church was again supplied with three\r\nhigh-pitched, gabled, and open roofs, of the original existence of\r\nwhich there was abundant evidence. The eastern ends of the aisles\r\nform chapels, known of old as the Hulme and Holford Chapels, and\r\nappropriated to the families of Shakerley of Hulme and Brooke of Mere.\r\nBoth chapels are separated from the chancel and from the rest of the\r\naisles by massive parclose screens of early Jacobean date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marton Church.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding two somewhat severe restorations during the Victorian\r\nperiod, the church of Marton, which stands out prominently close to the\r\nroadside, with its somewhat imposing tower and spire, is certainly the\r\nmost notable of the extant timber churches of Cheshire. In this case\r\nthe exact date of much of the present fabric is known. The chapel of\r\nSt. Paul’s at Marton (for it remained a chapel of the widespread parish\r\nof Prestbury until comparatively modern days) was founded by Sir John\r\nDavenport in the year 1343. He endowed it with 60 acres of land, and\r\nthe chaplain was to celebrate masses for himself, his ancestors, and\r\nhis posterity. When Randle Holme visited this church in 1597, he noted\r\nthat “In the Chapell yard lyeth there two monuments (of which rough\r\ndrawings were given); it is said by ancient people that they were Sir\r\nJohn Davenport and Vivian, his son, who founded the chapell of Merton,\r\n17 Edward III., and they lie buried there, obiit 31 Edward III., 1357.”\r\nThese monuments, or rather stone effigies, have rested under the tower\r\nsince 1871. They are both much more mutilated, through their long\r\nsojourn in the churchyard, than they were in Randle Holme’s days. It is\r\nsaid, though scarcely credible, that they were ejected from the church\r\nby ignorant Elizabethan Puritans under the supposition that the two\r\nknights were popish images! The one on the north side, said to be Sir\r\nJohn Davenport, has lost both legs, but the feet rest on a lion; the\r\nhead rests on a great helm crested with a man’s head couped. The figure\r\non the south side is very similar; one leg is missing. Both of them are\r\nundoubtedly of fourteenth-century date.\r\n\r\nThe church underwent some repairs in 1804, when the old roof was\r\ntaken off and lowered. In 1850 there was a considerable and unhappy\r\nrestoration, when the old two-light wooden-framed traceried windows\r\nof fourteenth-century date (one of them is drawn or described in Mr.\r\nMassie’s paper just cited) were removed and plainer three-light windows\r\nsubstituted. A yet more considerable restoration took place, under Mr.\r\nButterfield, in 1871, when the old north door was closed, the south\r\nporch rebuilt, and much new work introduced into the outer woodwork of\r\nthe tower. Fortunately Mr. Massie’s paper on the timber churches of\r\nthe county is illustrated by drawings of the exterior and interior of\r\nMarton church, as well as of the inner timber framework of the tower,\r\ntaken before Mr. Derrick, the architect of 1850-51, had begun his\r\ndoubtless well-intentioned but sadly destructive work. From these it\r\ncan be gathered that at that time the body of the fabric was much the\r\nsame as when originally built by Sir John Davenport.\r\n\r\nThe substantial pointed wooden entrance on the west side of the tower\r\nbasement, as well as the doorway within the south porch, appears to\r\nbe fourteenth century. In the interior there are two substantial oak\r\npillars on each side of the nave supporting arcades of three arches.\r\nThese pillars are octagonal, with projecting moulded capitals, and\r\nfrom these capitals spring timbers forming an arch across the nave,\r\nas at Nether Peover. The dimensions of the nave are 37 ft. 9 in. in\r\nlength, with a complete width of 33 ft. The church evidently underwent\r\nconsiderable alteration and improvement in the fifteenth century,\r\nat which time a substantial wooden tower was added at the west end,\r\nsurmounted by a broached spire. The massive timber framework to\r\nsupport the belfry and spire is carried out after the same fashion as\r\nthe best of the wooden towers of Essex. It has a projecting course of\r\nbuttressing timbers to the lower stage, which is covered with lean-to\r\nroofs. The interior measurements of the ground-plan of the tower\r\nare 23 ft. 9 in. north and south by 17 ft. 1 in. east and west. The\r\nouter uprights of the framework of this lower stage have an effective\r\nquatrefoil pattern at the head of each division just below the eaves.\r\nThe last restoration was done on somewhat meagre lines, for several\r\nof these quatrefoils and other parts of the outer timbers are of\r\nblack-painted deal. The roofing of this part is in stone slates, and\r\nthe octagonal spire is shingled.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the restoration of the church in 1871, the chancel,\r\nwhich had been rebuilt in brick about 1800, was restored externally\r\nin woodwork. The whole of the outer black-and-white framework of the\r\nchurch now consists of uprights of timber, at a short distance apart,\r\nbanded together by a horizontal transom, the intervals being filled up\r\nwith plaster.\r\n\r\nThe pulpit seems to date from about 1625. The font is remarkable,\r\nconsisting of a square leaden bowl or basin, enclosed in a square frame\r\nof oak. We suppose that this extraordinary font (which has more than\r\nonce been ignorantly added to the list of old lead fonts) can only date\r\nfrom the restoration of 1871, for Sir Stephen Glynne’s notes of 1853\r\nname the font as “a plain octagonal bowl.” There is a plain oak chest,\r\n5 ft. 8 in. long by 1 ft. 9 in. broad and 1 ft. 10 in. high, with three\r\nhinges and three square lock plates; its date is _circa_ 1550. At\r\nthe west end are two eighteenth-century pictures of Moses and Aaron,\r\npainted on panels, with the Ten Commandments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Siddington Church.]\r\n\r\nA short distance to the west of Marton lies the church of All Saints,\r\nSiddington, which was also a former chapel of Prestbury. It is usually\r\nstated that it was erected in 1474, but this statement is merely based\r\non the fact that there was a bequest in that year by Robert Sydyngton\r\nto that chapel. It is said that this church or chapel was originally\r\nentirely of timber and plaster, which may very probably have been\r\nthe case; but at present it is only the chancel which is of that\r\nconstruction, together with the south porch and the belfry or square\r\nturret over the west end of the nave. The fabric was much restored in\r\n1853-54, and again in 1895-96. At first sight the west front appears\r\nto be of an elaborate black-and-white half-timbered design, but it is\r\nin reality merely painted to produce this effect. The south porch has\r\na wide arched entrance of old timber, formed of three pieces, and the\r\ninner doorway is of like construction and apparently _temp._ Henry\r\nVII. The interior of the plastered nave walls are painted to imitate\r\nhalf-timber work. The upright timbers of the chancel are about a foot\r\napart. The east end has an interesting projecting piece of cored\r\nwork over the three-light wooden-framed window. There is some old\r\nscreen-work, and the pulpit is dated 1633.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Warburton Church.]\r\n\r\nAt Warburton, on the northern confines of the county, close to the\r\ngreat Ship Canal, stands the old church of St. Werburgh, which was\r\nat one time entirely of timber; but there were some outer stonework\r\nrepairs done to the west end of the nave in 1645, and a brick tower\r\nwas added to the north-east of the church in 1711. The interior of the\r\nchurch and chancel afford remarkable examples of timber construction.\r\nThe two bays of the nave are supported on each side by two great\r\ntimber pillars, which have bevelled edges but no capitals. There is a\r\nspace of 15 feet between them. A single high-pitch roof covers both\r\nnave and aisles. The timber details of the chancel, with its chapel\r\non the north, are also somewhat exceptional, as appears in the plate\r\nand seem to be of somewhat later date than the nave. Among other\r\nquaint details of this interesting church, it may be mentioned that\r\ndeer-horns are attached to the nave pillars to serve as hat-pegs. The\r\nlarge octagonal font is inscribed, “William Drinkwater, the Keeper,\r\n1603”; it bears a wooden pyramidal cover, which has the date 1595 at\r\nthe apex. The altar table, altar rails, and pulpit are all Jacobean.\r\nThere is a simply-formed iron hour-glass stand near the pulpit. In the\r\nnorth chapel or small aisle of the chancel is a large stone coffin,\r\nover 7 feet long, also a much smaller one, about 3 feet long, a fine\r\nthirteenth-century grave cover, and some other remains which were found\r\nin the churchyard and placed here in 1819.\r\n\r\nAt Chadkirk, near Romiley, in the north-east of the county, there\r\nis an ancient chapel of very early foundation, as its name implies,\r\nwhich was doubtless at one time, as tradition has it, wholly of\r\ntimber construction. It came in 1548 into the evil hands of Edward\r\nVI.’s commissioners, when its small endowment was confiscated to the\r\nCrown and the building itself dismantled under the plea of being a\r\nsuperstitious chantry. It was “raised out of its ruins” in 1747,\r\n“repaired, beautified, and a loft erected” in 1761; again repaired in\r\n1860, and finally restored in 1876, as is stated on tablets within the\r\nwalls. The nave is now of stone, after a Georgian fashion; but the\r\nsmall chancel, which has brick walling on the south, has interesting\r\nancient oak and plaster work at the east end and on the north side,\r\nwhich is at least as old as the beginning of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt remains to say a word or two as to another ancient Cheshire chapel\r\nwhich up to about a century ago was described as being “wholly of\r\noak and plaster.” This was the chapel of High Leigh (West Hall), to\r\nthe north-west of Knutsford. This chapel was pulled down in 1814,\r\nwhen a pretentious, classical substitute was erected on the site. A\r\npeculiarity of the old chapel was that it had no bell turret, but a\r\nsingle bell swung from the boughs of a great sycamore tree near its\r\nwest end. The classical chapel was destroyed by fire in 1891, and in\r\n1893 the church of St. John’s, built on the same site, and chiefly\r\nconstructed in black-and-white half-timber, was opened for worship.\r\n\r\nIn Ormerod’s _Cheshire_, early in the last century, the church of\r\nBaddiley is described as “standing on a small green within the same\r\nenclosure with the barns and other domestic buildings. It consists of a\r\nsmall nave and chancel, originally composed of timber. Another nave has\r\nbeen recently underbuilt with brick.” The writer of these notes has not\r\nhad the opportunity of seeing this small church, but it has apparently\r\nnot changed during the century, for it is described in the _Little\r\nGuide to Cheshire_ (1905) as consisting of “brick and timber,” whilst\r\nin the introduction it is named as one of the half-timbered churches.\r\n\r\nThere are many traditions up and down the county as to various other\r\nparish churches or chapels having been originally timber-framed or of\r\nblack-and-white work. In some cases these traditions are known to have\r\nbeen true. Thus Goostrey church was half-timber up to 1790 (probably\r\nfrom its foundation in 1230), when it was pulled down to make room for\r\na brick successor; and Eccleston church was half-timbered up to 1808.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bruera Church, near Chester.]\r\n\r\nIn several of the southern counties many of the stone or flint churches\r\nhave timber belfries over the western gable of the nave,[5] but such a\r\nconstruction seems to have never been common in Cheshire. The church\r\nof Bruera, formerly a chapelry of St. Oswald’s, Chester, a building of\r\nmuch interest, with traces of Saxon work, has a somewhat remarkable\r\nwooden belfry at the west end; it has been restored, but the older part\r\nof the timbers are of fourteenth-century date.\r\n\r\n [5] Such towers are to be seen at Warndon, Dornston, Kington, and\r\n Pirton in Worcestershire.--Editor.\r\n\r\nThere was much timber-work in the smaller parish churches of Chester in\r\nthe old days, as is shown by the pen-and-ink drawings of Randle Holme\r\nIII. in the latter part of the seventeenth century (Harl. MS. 2073).\r\nThe elaborate drawing of St. Peter’s church shows that considerable\r\ncivic building, known as the Pentice or pent-house, a great timber\r\nlean-to on the south side, rebuilt about 1500, but extant in another\r\nform as early as 1311; it was not pulled down until 1808. St.\r\nMartin’s had a wooden belfry on the west gable and a timber porch on\r\nthe south side, approached by a flight of steps of the like material.\r\nSt. Olave’s had also an elaborate wooden belfry on the west gable,\r\nwhich was taken down in 1693. St. Michael’s had a considerable tower\r\nof timber at the west end, as well as a curious raised portico or room\r\nresting on wooden pillars over the west entrance. St. Bridget’s is\r\nshown with a timber parapet, resting on projecting beams, encircling\r\nthe base of the spire; all this was taken down in 1690.\r\n\r\nCheshire used to be a remarkably well-wooded county, and this is\r\nstill the case in several districts. The area occupied by woods and\r\nplantations, according to the last woodland return of 1905, is 24,655\r\nacres, and this takes no account of hedgerow timber or detached trees,\r\nfor which the vale of Chester is so celebrated. The two chief royal\r\nforests of Cheshire were those of Mara and Moudrem, afterwards known\r\nas Delamere, about the centre of the county, and Macclesfield, on the\r\nsouth-east. The two parishes which have now the largest acreage of\r\nwoodland are those of Delamere, 2596, and Taxal (below Macclesfield),\r\n1285. There was a third forest district, namely, that of the Hundred\r\nof Wirral, that big projecting peninsula which juts out to the north\r\nbetween the Mersey and the Dee. The old term forest did not, however,\r\nimply a big wood, but simply a district reserved for royal hunting; and\r\nWirral Forest was singularly destitute of timber, according to the old\r\nrecords, as it is at the present day. The parish of Woodchurch, not far\r\nto the south of Birkenhead, probably obtained its name in early days\r\nfrom being the only place within many miles which had a church of logs\r\nor timber framing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE WALLS AND ROWS OF CHESTER\r\n\r\n  By the Archdeacon of Chester\r\n\r\n\r\nIts Walls and Rows (especially the latter) give to the city of Chester\r\na character all its own. They are not only the pride of the inhabitants\r\nof the city and county, but they also afford an unfailing source of\r\nattraction to a constant stream of tourists and visitors. In no other\r\ntown in the kingdom is it possible to make a complete circuit of the\r\nWalls, which involves a walk of nearly a couple of miles. That walk\r\nis a favourite promenade, and offers a pleasing and varying prospect\r\nnot only of the different features of interest in the city, but also\r\nof the surrounding country, and of the distant Welsh hills. The Walls\r\ntoo furnish a never-ending subject for discussion as to their origin\r\nand history; upon which fresh light is continually being thrown by\r\ndiscoveries that are made. The main point in dispute has been as to\r\nwhether they can claim any connection with Roman builders; and the\r\nquestion seems by some to have been settled in the affirmative on\r\nvarious grounds. Whilst Roman stones have been found in portions of the\r\nnorth wall when under repair, on the eastern side some masonry is to\r\nbe seen which from its character may safely be ascribed to that early\r\ndate; and quite recently some excavations, which were necessary for\r\nbuilding operations, unearthed at that particular spot the foundations\r\nof the Roman wall just a few feet in front of the present one. The\r\nplinth thus discovered indicates that the place is the south-eastern\r\nangle of the Roman Wall, and proves what had been tentatively\r\nsuggested, that originally and in Roman times the compass of the Walls\r\nwas considerably less than it is now. It has been suggested that at a\r\nlater date the Romans enlarged the boundaries of the town, which at\r\nfirst was a camp or fortress, and that subsequently Ethelfleda, in\r\n907, when she repaired the city, which had lain waste, still further\r\nenlarged its borders on the south side. On the west there are undoubted\r\ntraces of Roman work, and here the Walls (or more correctly the Quay)\r\nin early days must have been washed by the tidal waters of the Dee,\r\nand vessels must have been able to come up close to them and moor at\r\ntheir side. The Roman stones discovered in the north wall when it\r\nwas under repair, were many of them inscribed and sepulchral: and so\r\nsome authorities concluded that they could not have been placed there\r\nby Roman builders. It was shown, however, that a similar use of a\r\nsepulchral monument occurred in a bastion of the Roman wall of London,\r\nand that none of these stones were found in the upper part of the\r\nwall, but in the lower unmortared base, which was evidently Roman. The\r\nconclusion arrived at was that the Romans had extended their wall at\r\nan early period, and, in doing so, had enclosed or made use of their\r\ncemetery. In confirmation of this theory, it may be stated that the\r\nsurrounding masonry is of Roman character, and that a similar use of\r\ntombstones has been found elsewhere, as in a Roman edifice on the Roman\r\nWall in England, and at Worms, and other towns in Gaul. As we walk\r\nround the Walls, then, to-day, we may remember that a considerable\r\nportion of them are on the foundations and lines laid down in Roman\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe upper portion is no doubt Edwardian, though alterations and\r\nrepairs at different times have somewhat altered their character.\r\nThis is specially to be noted in the removal, at the close of the\r\neighteenth century, of the old Gateways. These, as we can see from old\r\nprints, were striking and picturesque, if they were at the same time\r\ninconvenient. In York the Gateways (or Bars as they are there termed)\r\nhave been retained, and the convenience for traffic has been obtained\r\nby opening arches at the side of them and leaving the Bars untouched.\r\nWe can only regret that the same policy was not adopted in Chester.\r\n\r\nEach of the four gates was under the guardianship or sergeantry of\r\nparticular persons. The North Gate, which contained the prison,\r\nwas under the charge of the city authorities; the East Gate, given\r\noriginally to Henry de Bradford, passed into the possession of the\r\nCrewe family. The sergeantry of the Water Gate descended through the\r\nBarony of Montalt to the Earl of Derby, and that of the Bridge Gate\r\nfrom the Rabys and Troutbecks to the Earl of Shrewsbury. Near each of\r\nthese latter two gates are beautiful old specimens of half-timbered\r\nhouses, where the sergeants or their deputies used to live. In addition\r\nto these principal gates, there were smaller ones or posterns, like the\r\nShip Gate, which led to the crossing over the Dee--the New Gate, and\r\nthe small Kale Yard Gate, which led to the monastic vegetable garden.\r\nThere was also a further protection, at a distance of about a quarter\r\nof a mile on the road eastward, called the Bars, which has been removed\r\nmany years ago, though the name is still preserved.\r\n\r\nIn early times a murage rate was levied for the maintenance of the\r\nWalls, and the officers who had charge thereof and collected and\r\nexpended this money were called murengers. At one time a considerable\r\nsum was raised by the impost placed upon Irish linen, which was\r\nimported into Chester in large quantities.\r\n\r\nAs we walk round the Walls we can call to mind the scenes which must\r\nhave been enacted on them when the city was attacked. In those days\r\nthe walk was probably at a lower level, or at any rate the outer Wall\r\nwas higher (and perhaps battlemented), thus affording protection to\r\nthe defenders. At various distances were bastions and towers, some few\r\nof which remain, and enable us to form a better idea of the earlier\r\ncondition of the city defences. In Roman times there was the\r\nadditional protection of a ditch or fosse, and traces of this have\r\nbeen found in various places. When the Canal was made close to the\r\nNorth Wall the contractor found to his great advantage that much of the\r\nexcavation out of the solid rock had thus been done for him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bonewaldesthorne’s Tower.]\r\n\r\nThe common gaol of the city was in the North Gate, and the prisoners\r\nthere confined must have had very close quarters. A similar use of the\r\nNorth Gate was made at Canterbury (where the building still remains),\r\nand possibly in other places. Just outside the North Gate is the\r\nHospital of St. John, and here in later years the prisoners attended\r\ndivine service. A memorial of this is to be seen in the little bridge\r\nwhich crossed the fosse, now the Canal, and which has been sometimes\r\ncalled “The Bridge of Sighs.” Not far from here westward is Morgan’s\r\nMount, with a lower chamber and an upper platform from which a fine\r\nview may be obtained. During the siege of the city a very important\r\nbattery was planted here, and the site may well arouse memories of\r\nanxious and troublous times. Still further west is Pemberton’s Parlour,\r\nso called from the fact that in 1700 John Pemberton established a\r\nrope walk here within the walls, and probably from this spot watched\r\nat times the operations of his workmen, or rested here after his own\r\nlabours. Though now semi-circular in shape, it may once have been\r\ncircular, with a passage through it. It also bore other names, as\r\n“Dille’s Tower,” or “The Goblin’s Tower,” the latter suggestive of\r\na ghost story connected with it. An inscription on the city side\r\nrecords the repair of this portion of the Walls 200 years ago, and\r\nreminds us of those civic functionaries, the murengers, who had\r\ncharge of the Walls. The north-west angle of the Walls is marked by\r\nBonewaldesthorne’s Tower, and connected with it by a battlemented\r\ncurtain wall is the New or Water Tower. When the latter was built in\r\n1323 it was washed by the waters of the Dee, and not long since the\r\nrings attached to it for the mooring of vessels might have been seen.\r\nAt the present day the Tower rises out of gardens, and the river is\r\nat some little distance away. Continuing our walk southwards we come\r\nto the Roodeye. Formerly, as its name implies, this was an island\r\nsurrounded at high tide by the waters of the estuary, but it gradually\r\nsilted up. In 1609 Mr. W. Lester, mercer, who was then Mayor, founded,\r\nchiefly at his own cost, the St. George’s Race, which was to be run on\r\nSt. George’s Day. This was the origin of the Chester Races, which take\r\nplace ordinarily in the first week in May, which would correspond with\r\nold St. George’s Day. On its first foundation the race was introduced\r\nby a stately procession, in which certain emblematical characters took\r\npart, as well as the Mayor and Corporation “in their best apparell and\r\nin scarlet,” and it was followed by a civic banquet at the Pentice. We\r\nmay call up such scenes as these as we look over the Racecourse, and\r\nnot content ourselves with imagining what things are like, when that\r\nbusy throng comes to the Chester Races nowadays. Here, too, were at\r\ntimes presented the Miracle Plays and city Pageants, and Triumphs and\r\nother games, including that of football, promoted by the Company of\r\nShoemakers on Shrove Tuesday, otherwise Goteddesse Day, which in 1539\r\nwas abolished _owing to its dangerous_ character, foot races being\r\nsubstituted. We may think, too, of the training of soldiers here in\r\nElizabeth’s reign, and in recent years of the Yeomanry, until they were\r\nremoved to Delamere Forest. As we reach the southern side, and see the\r\nwaters of the Dee, we may picture to ourselves Edgar rowed up by the\r\ntributary princes to the Church of St. John, and in later times see the\r\nWalls manned by archers and other brave defenders, ready to resist the\r\nincursions of the Welsh. In short, the Walls are full of interesting\r\nmemories, though only one event is chronicled in an inscription in\r\nstone, and that is on the Phœnix Tower, so called from the device of\r\nthe Painters’ and Stationers’ Company, which is carved upon its south\r\nwall. It was from the top of the Tower that King Charles I. witnessed\r\nthe defeat of his forces on Rowton Moor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: King Charles’s Tower.]\r\n\r\nBut though only one event is thus definitely recorded, we can think of\r\nothers--of the monks bringing in solemn procession the relics of St.\r\nWerburgh at some critical time of danger, and of the protection which\r\nthese venerable Walls afforded to the dwellers in the city. Now indeed\r\nthey afford a pleasant and enjoyable promenade, much frequented both\r\nby residents and visitors; but time was when they were an absolute\r\nnecessity to secure the safety of the citizens, and needed to be\r\njealously guarded by their watchmen, whilst the Gates which provided\r\nan entrance had their sergeants and keepers. And thus a walk round the\r\nWalls should not fail to suggest a contrast between the peaceful days\r\nin which we live, and the troublous and disturbed times which often\r\nthreatened our forefathers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Watergate Row, Chester.]\r\n\r\nIf the Walls of our city possess this great interest for us, what shall\r\nwe say of our Rows? They are practically unique. Other cities and towns\r\nhave their Walls, but no other place, in England at any rate, has\r\nanything like the Rows. And their origin is veiled in obscurity. It\r\nis very difficult to give such a description of them as shall enable\r\none who has not seen them to realise what they are like. The late Dean\r\nHowson spoke of them as “public highways passing through the front part\r\nof the drawing-rooms on the first floor of a series of houses, the\r\nwindows being taken out, while the inner parts of these drawing-rooms\r\nare converted into shops, the bedrooms being overhead, and the\r\npassengers walking over the rooms of the ground storey, these rooms\r\nagain being converted into shops.” Mr. Pennant in his _Tour_ gives\r\nthis description, founded, as we shall see, upon a mistaken idea as to\r\ntheir origin:--“The principal streets run direct from east to west and\r\nfrom north to south, and were excavated out of the earth, and sunk many\r\nfeet below the surface. The carriages are driven far below the level\r\nof the kitchens, on a line with ranges of shops, over which passengers\r\nwalk in galleries, which the inhabitants call the Rows, secure from\r\nwet or heat. In the Rows are likewise ranges of shops and steps to\r\ndescend into the street.” Without giving earlier descriptions, it will\r\nbe gathered, that in the main streets within the city Walls there are\r\ncovered galleries over the shops on the street level, which also are\r\nlined with shops. The walks in these galleries do not come quite to the\r\nstreet frontage, as opposite each shop there is, as a rule, a “stall,”\r\nor sloping platform, on which goods may be exposed, though in some few\r\ninstances this space is occupied by buildings of a permanent character.\r\nThe stalls are protected from the street to which they are open by\r\nbalustrades, some of which are of oak and of varying and handsome old\r\npatterns. As the shops represent different properties, there is a\r\npleasing lack of uniformity about the Rows. In some instances we have\r\nthe half-timbered architecture for which Cheshire is famous, in others\r\nhouses of the date of Queen Anne; whilst in recent times some have been\r\nrebuilt and made more in accordance with modern requirements, though\r\ndue regard has latterly been paid to the character of the ancient\r\nbuildings. The walk in Eastgate and Bridge Street is continuous, and\r\nhere are the best and principal shops; in the other streets the walk is\r\ninterrupted by intervening lanes or streets, except on the south side\r\nof Watergate Street, where there are some very striking houses, such as\r\n“Bishop Lloyd’s Palace,” or “God’s Providence House.” The variety is\r\nalso seen in the height of the colonnade, which is sometimes through\r\nthe older houses quite low, and in the more modern ones much higher. On\r\nthe west side of Bridge Street there is, in fact, barely headroom for a\r\nvery tall person in some parts, but here there are no shops in the Row,\r\nso that the inconvenience is not felt. In the greater part of Northgate\r\nthe Row, if it ever existed, has disappeared, and in another part it\r\nhas recently been brought down to the street level, the under shops,\r\nwhich were really cellars, having been removed. The Rows thus, like the\r\nWalls, afford a favourite promenade for visitors. In rainy weather they\r\ngive protection to those who have business to transact in the shops\r\nwhich line them; whilst “the stalls” afford a convenient position\r\nfor witnessing any procession passing through the streets. We may even\r\ngo back in thought to early days and imagine how they would be crowded\r\nwith spectators when the Chester Plays were acted in the streets, or\r\nwhen the questionable sport (?) of bull-baiting took place before the\r\nPentice at the High Cross. It is curious to know that the ownership of\r\nthe property on the street level does not necessarily carry with it the\r\nownership of the shop or house in the Row above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bishop Lloyd’s Palace, Watergate Row.]\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the city there are shops or houses where the first\r\nfloor, supported by brick or stone arches or by wooden posts, is over\r\nthe footway or pavement, and in the city accounts there are repeated\r\nentries of payments made for posts set up in the streets to hold up\r\nhouses. Interesting examples of this are to be seen in Foregate Street\r\nand in Northgate.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the Rows is so singular, that much discussion\r\nhas taken place as to their history and origin. Some have contended\r\nthat they may be traced back to the Roman period, and that they were\r\nprobably suggested by the common form of Roman building with a portico\r\nin front of them. Much ingenuity has been displayed by architects and\r\nothers who urge this view in the drawings by which they seek to justify\r\nthis contention. Stress, too, is laid by them on the fact that the Rows\r\nare confined to that part of the city which is of Roman origin, though\r\nthis fact has been denied by those who adopt other theories.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. John Henry Parker, F.S.A., in 1857, wrote as\r\nfollows:--“The most probable origin of these Rows is, that after some\r\ngreat fire, it was found most convenient to make the footway on the\r\ntop of the cellars, or vaulted substructures, instead of in the narrow\r\nstreets between them. It was the usual custom in the towns in the\r\nMiddle Ages to protect the lower storey, or cellar, which was half\r\nunderground, by a vault of stone or brick. This was the storeroom\r\nin which the merchandise or other valuable property was preserved.\r\nThe upper parts of the houses were entirely of wood, and the whole of\r\nthese being destroyed by fire, it was more easy to make the footway\r\non the top of the vaults, leaving the roadway clear for horses and\r\ncarts. Many of these vaulted chambers of the mediæval period remain in\r\nChester, more or less perfect; some divided by modern walls and used as\r\ncellars, others perfect and used as lower shops or warehouses.” This\r\ntheory, again, is ingenious, and has this justification, that in 1114\r\na large part of the city was destroyed by fire; but against it may be\r\nurged the fact that one of the most perfect, and probably the oldest\r\nof these crypts (the house or shop in which it is being called “Ye\r\nOlde Crypt”), is not in the street front, but beneath the back portion\r\nof the house. Others have supposed that the original ground-level of\r\nthe city was the same level with the Rows, and that the streets were\r\ngradually worn down to their present level through the solid rock. This\r\nopinion has, however, been shown to be untenable, inasmuch as in Bridge\r\nStreet, Watergate, and other parts, Roman remains have been discovered\r\nwhich show that in Roman times buildings were even a little below the\r\npresent street level, and that the foundations of the Roman buildings\r\ncorrespond practically with the height of the roadway. Archdeacon\r\nRogers, at the end of the sixteenth century, urged that the Rows were\r\nconstructed for defensive purposes, and would be found useful in this\r\nway in the time of Welsh incursions. We have, however, no record of\r\nthe Welsh having ever effected an entrance into the town, so that the\r\nprecaution would seem to have been superfluous. Canon Morris, in his\r\nvaluable work (_Chester during the Plantagenet and Tudor Periods_),\r\nadvances another theory at some length to account for the gradual\r\ndevelopment of the Rows from the seldæ, or movable sheds, on the street\r\nlevel, and the shops built on the higher ground behind, formed of the\r\ndebris of Roman buildings which had been destroyed. These are some\r\nof the ideas which have been propounded as to the origin of the\r\nRows. It is well to state them, so that our readers may gather what a\r\nfertile source of interesting discussion they furnish. Mr. Henry Dawes\r\nHarrod, F.S.A., after carefully examining these explanations, and the\r\narguments on which they were based, came to the conclusion that we must\r\nlook to ancient Chester for the origin of the Rows, and so go back to\r\nRoman times. His contention is not unlike that of Canon Morris, only\r\nhe gives an earlier date. He says: “The shop of the ambulatory, with\r\nits covered way, is perpetuated in the shop in the Row. The stall for\r\ntraders on the steps finds its lineal descendant in the shop in the\r\nstreets. The covering over the Rows has given way before the growth of\r\nthe houses to the front, economising space, and affording better living\r\naccommodation. Without any great revolution in design or architecture,\r\nthe Rows have developed by a natural growth on the lines of the ancient\r\ndesign of Roman Chester.”\r\n\r\n“When doctors differ who shall decide?” It may not be possible to come\r\nto a definite conclusion on the matter; but, personally, I think that\r\nthe contention of Mr. Harrod, advanced in a paper read before the\r\nChester Archæological Society on 19th February 1901, and supported\r\nby arguments and illustrations, is a most reasonable one, which at\r\nany rate commends itself to my humble judgment. The mere mention of\r\nthese various theories may perhaps lead some of our readers to take\r\neven greater interest in the Rows of Chester, and remind the dwellers\r\nin both city and county that in them they possess a great and unique\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE HALF-TIMBERED ARCHITECTURE OF CHESHIRE\r\n\r\n  By C. H. Minshull\r\n\r\n  “He that hewed timber out of the thick trees: was known to bring it to\r\n  an excellent work.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbeit this paper is to confine itself to the domestic or secular side\r\nof the subject, and this quotation might even more suitably serve as\r\nhis text by the author treating exclusively of the ecclesiastical\r\nexamples of timber-framed buildings, yet its appropriateness may\r\nwarrant these words forming a sort of superscription for what is after\r\nall part and parcel of one theme.\r\n\r\nWhile it may be conceded that Cheshire can count many extant memorials\r\nof greater historic importance and of longer lineage than any of those\r\nremaining recorded in that particular kind of “black and white” coming\r\nwithin our present immediate purview, it may nevertheless be claimed\r\nthat these specimens of the carpenter’s craft constitute by no means\r\nthe least charming and characteristic of the county’s architectural\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nThe “post and panel” work, the “magpie” style, to use the sobriquet\r\nsometimes familiarly applied to it, so plentifully strewn throughout\r\nits length and breadth, does certainly bring a very distinct\r\ncontribution to the picturesqueness of the Palatinate, whose now\r\nfertile plain, studded with these timber structures, is where buildings\r\nof this traditional type most do congregate. Indeed, it is a question\r\nwhether they do not serve to connote Cheshire quite as much as that\r\nprosaic product the cheese, which has made the name and fame of\r\nthe county a household word! Another proof of the identification of\r\nthe county with the kind of buildings under consideration is that\r\nwhen a building is referred to as being in the “Cheshire style,” the\r\ndescription is always understood as implying a half-timbered erection,\r\nand at the same time goes to show that its designer has been paying his\r\ntribute of imitation to and admiration of the manner and method, which\r\nformerly was so felicitously employed in several parts of the country,\r\nbut in none more extensively than in Cheshire--a fact happily still\r\ncapable of demonstration in the frequency of surviving examples.\r\n\r\nMany a piquant touch of contrasted colour does the landscape owe to\r\nthese delightful buildings, one of whose attractive qualities resides\r\nin just that faculty of focussing the eye they so eminently possess.\r\nHere it may be a cluster of quaint cottages, or perhaps a single\r\ncottage of comely proportions nestling in some sequestered spot, or one\r\nof those moated granges or sturdy farmsteads that dot the countryside;\r\nor there it may be a more elaborate and ornate example, some “stately\r\nhome,” attesting the skilful handiwork of the _faber lignarius_ who\r\ncenturies ago followed his calling with such excellent and enduring\r\nresults, his fitly and soundly framing of the building together having\r\nenabled it to withstand the action of time and weather--if so be by\r\ngood fortune it managed to escape that more fatal enemy fire, whose\r\nravages are no doubt responsible for the disappearance of many an\r\narchitectural treasure, which, had a more resistant material been\r\nemployed, might have survived to shed additional lustre on the county,\r\nalready so renowned for its half-timbered treasures.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the prevalence of this species of building, and of\r\nCheshire having become _par excellence_ a centre for it, is, of course,\r\nto be found in the fact of the county having possessed an abundance of\r\nraw material in the “thick trees” ready to the hand of the hewer.\r\n\r\nIn his _Story of some English Shires_, as told by the late Dr. Mandell\r\nCreighton, speaking of the physical features of Cheshire, he says:\r\n“Three great forests covered much of the surface of the ground. From\r\nChester to the sea stretched the forest of Wirral, from the Mersey to\r\nthe Dee extended the forest of Delamere, and the forest of Macclesfield\r\nformed an impenetrable barrier between Cheshire and Derbyshire”; and he\r\nadds a remark not altogether irrelevant to the matter in hand: “There\r\nwas so little agriculture that the men of Cheshire used to leave their\r\nhomes and serve as harvesters in districts where corn was grown, in the\r\nsame way as did Irish labourers in our own days.” These copious sources\r\nof timber have long since disappeared, and the once afforested area has\r\ngiven place to those broad acres under cultivation now covering the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nIn _Domesday Book_, under Cestrescire, these forests are often referred\r\nto, but we are left to conjecture what were the trees growing in them;\r\ndoubtless there was the ash and the elm, and also “the monarch oak,\r\nsole king of forests all,” ready to hand for those who, in the elder\r\ndays of the carpenter’s art, erected the dwellings from which those\r\nlater buildings now being considered are either lineal or collateral\r\ndescendants. The earliest extant of these may only carry us back some\r\n500 years, but this had not only Norman but Anglo-Saxon progenitors.\r\nIt is well known that the latter employed both in their churches and\r\nhouses timber as their staple building material, and although all\r\nthese have perished there remains the testimony of their language; the\r\nSaxon word “timbran” signified to build with wood, and builder meant\r\ncarpenter. Their rude halls may be regarded as the origin of the old\r\nEnglish timber-built houses.\r\n\r\nThe oldest form of rectangular house was erected in “bays,” the\r\nsimplest form of construction being the house of one bay. Two pairs of\r\nbent trees (whence the term “roof tree” seems an outcome) were set up\r\nin the ground about 16 feet apart, each pair making a sort of pointed\r\narch, united at their apexes by a longitudinal beam. The gable end of\r\nmany an old Cheshire cottage shows the persistence of this traditional\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nBefore bringing under review some few of the many specimens the county\r\ncontains, a word or two with regard to their method of construction\r\nmay not be out of place. Scarcity of stone and difficulties of transit\r\naccount for this material being so sparingly used. Upon a few courses\r\nof stonework forming a plinth, horizontal beams were laid, and into\r\nthese angle posts and intermediate uprights were framed. These carried\r\nthe sill of the upper storey, whose floor joists were often made to\r\nproject, producing the “overhang,” frequently coved, which is one of\r\nthe most effective features of the style.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, so much the general disposition of their main\r\ntimbers as the varied patterns and devices of the panels filling\r\nin the intervening spaces that provides one of the distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of these Cheshire buildings. As one may often determine\r\na person’s native place by his dialect, so do these lozenges and other\r\nchequer patterns enable one to recognise the place of their origin;\r\nthey are, as it were, a sort of idiomatic architectural expression.\r\nWhen the carpenter had finished the skeleton of the structure,\r\nthere remained, to complete the wooden walls, the filling in of the\r\ninterstices of the framing. For this purpose, what is known as “wattle\r\nand daub” was commonly employed. By this primitive process clay could\r\nbe used in its natural state. The method was to make a foundation\r\nby interlacing osiers or hazel twigs, thus forming a sort of basket\r\nwork, and then to daub over with clay mixed with straw or some stringy\r\nweed, and upon this put a thin coating of plaster on both the inside\r\nand outside faces. In his _Cheshire Glossary_, Colonel Egerton Leigh\r\nremarks, “The daub seems to have given a name to a trade,” and in\r\nsupport of this statement a quaint old couplet is quoted:--\r\n\r\n    “The mayor of Altrincham and the mayor of Over,\r\n     The one is a thatcher, the other a dauber”;\r\n\r\nand then follows this favourable comment on the old process: “Clay,\r\nbeing a non-conductor, makes a warm house in winter and a cool one in\r\nsummer.”\r\n\r\nWhether this “post and panel” work originally presented the study in\r\nblack and white it now does, is open to question. Most likely the\r\ntarring of the timbers was resorted to rather with the object of\r\npreservation than with the intention of producing the contrasted effect\r\nbetween the wood and the plaster, now so conspicuous a characteristic.\r\nIt may be that the dark brown and yellow ochre colour combination one\r\nsees in the corresponding manner of building on the Continent was more\r\nlike the original appearance of these Cheshire buildings. Space forbids\r\ngoing into side issues and demands the taking into consideration some\r\nof the specimens of the “excellent work,” in which the county is so\r\nrich as to make the task of selection by no means easy.\r\n\r\nThe mere enumeration of notable examples would occupy many pages, and\r\nto deal with them in detail according to their deserts would call for a\r\ntreatise instead of this cursory survey. But for a complete chronicle,\r\nis there not Ormerod’s _magnum opus_?--that mine of information and\r\nmonument of industry which is indeed itself one of the county’s\r\n“memorials”; and for pictorial treatment there is that gallery of vivid\r\nillustrations, Nash’s _Mansions of the Olden Time_, wherein are to be\r\nseen, splendidly set forth, several of Cheshire’s celebrated “stately\r\nhomes,” both as regards their outward aspect and their interiors,\r\nand containing, moreover, counterfeit presentments of their former\r\noccupants in their habits as they lived.\r\n\r\nAny one unable to visit the actual building and desirous of getting an\r\nidea of their peculiar charm, aye and the splendour, of these fine old\r\nhalls of Cheshire, would be well-advised to turn to that artist’s views\r\nof Bramall, of Adlington, and of Moreton, which constitute a trio of\r\nhalf-timbered treasures not perhaps surpassed by any buildings of their\r\nkind in any other county, or indeed country.\r\n\r\nBy right of seniority, as well as by reason of uniqueness, Baguley\r\nor Baggily Hall, in the neighbourhood of Stockport, claims first\r\nconsideration. In Parker’s _Domestic Architecture_, remarking upon the\r\ndifficulty of finding timber houses of the fourteenth century, Baggily\r\nis referred to as a “rare example.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAGGILY HALL: SECTIONS THRO’ LARGE HALL\r\n  SECTION SHEWING KITCHEN END\r\n  SECTION SHEWING SPERE OF SCREEN.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE HALL: BAGGILY HALL, CHESHIRE.]\r\n\r\nOn this account and because of its intrinsic interest, it is now\r\nillustrated by two sectional views and by a sketch of the interior\r\nshowing the purely Gothic spirit of its open-timbered roof, and giving\r\nan idea of the massiveness of its oakwork.\r\n\r\nThere being but few surviving specimens for the purposes of further\r\nillustrating the period between the reign of Edward III., when Baggily\r\nwas built, and that of Elizabeth, certain almshouses from Commonhall\r\nLane, Chester, dating from about the time of Henry VII., may with\r\nadvantage be here adduced. Unfortunately they are no longer standing,\r\nbut, before they were pulled down some forty years ago, drawings were\r\nmade which have rendered possible their reconstruction by means of\r\nthis sketch; and by the reproduction of the window details to show the\r\ndistinctive character of this earlier type of timber work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ALMS HOUSES:\r\n  COMMONHALL LANE, CHESTER,\r\n  PULLED DOWN ABOUT 1870.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ALMS HOUSES: COMMONHALL LANE: CHESTER\r\n  PULLED DOWN ABOUT 1870.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is on reaching the spacious times of Queen Elizabeth that there is\r\nno longer any paucity but a positive profusion, and there ensues an\r\n_embarras de choix_ in the examples available.\r\n\r\nHer reign and that of her immediate successors constituted what may\r\nperhaps be called the classic era of half-timbered architecture. A\r\nperiod of not much more than a hundred years sufficed for the style to\r\nattain its zenith and reach its decline and passing in the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe frequency with which one comes across the royal cipher E. R. and\r\nthe many corroborative arms and date panels, both in Cheshire and\r\nelsewhere, bring to mind the marvellous outburst of energy and activity\r\nthat marked her times in all departments of life, one of whose outlets\r\nwas in the building operations of the period, and especially in the\r\ndomestic direction, some of the evidences of which we are now concerned\r\nwith. England, as has been truly said, is awake after the slumber of\r\nthe Middle Ages, and for a brief period the national life blazes with\r\nunprecedented brilliance and splendour.\r\n\r\nAdherence to the traditional manner of timber building in Cheshire\r\nwould be accounted for and be encouraged by the abundant supplies of\r\nthe requisite raw material still available; for this and the adjoining\r\ncounties of Shropshire and Lancashire, where this type of building also\r\nflourished, were at a safe distance from the iron-smelting works and\r\nship-building yards which made such inroads on the woods and forests in\r\nother parts of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn the attractive appearance of those Elizabethan erections, that\r\nBaconian dictum (certainly challengeable, at all events, from an\r\narchitect’s standpoint), “houses are built to live in and not to look\r\non,” found plenty of contemporary refutation in the picturesque and\r\ndelightful halls of this county.\r\n\r\nAs in the Edwardian Baggily Hall, so in its Elizabethan successors\r\nthe “great hall” continued to be the chief feature, the principal\r\npivot, so to say, of the general plan. But, whereas in the earlier\r\nexamples it was invariably open right up to the roof, it gradually\r\nbegan to be divided into two storeys by the interposition of a floor.\r\nOne consequence of this change was the disappearance of the minstrels’\r\ngallery and the dais. The cause of the decline in importance of the\r\ngreat hall may partly have been the introduction of Italian ideas, but\r\nwas mainly due to the alteration in the habits of life. The progress\r\nof civilisation brought with it the multiplication of apartments,\r\nand hence the space once entirely occupied by the lofty hall could no\r\nlonger be afforded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRAMALL: THE PORCH E´. END.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRAMALL: A CORNER OF THE SOUTH WING.]\r\n\r\nAn exemplification of this is provided by Bramall, where the “great\r\nhall” has a flat ceiling, and above this is the drawing-room; an\r\napartment growing rapidly into importance in Elizabethan times. This\r\nupper chamber, as is the case of Bramall, becomes more handsomely\r\ntreated with raised plaster and other ornament, and is, moreover,\r\nmuch loftier than the hall below it. Access was by means of a spiral\r\nstaircase of solid blocks of oak. Bramall, like other contemporary\r\nhalls of its class, was originally built in quadrangular form; but when\r\npeaceful times came, the owners, desiring a more open outlook, secured\r\nthis by doing away with one side of the quadrangle, and with it swept\r\naway the gate-house. The south-eastern wing contains, as houses of this\r\nperiod commonly do, a domestic chapel and also the fine banqueting\r\nroom. One of its most noteworthy features, “the long gallery,” of which\r\nOrmerod gives a sketch, has disappeared. Bramall originally belonged\r\nto the Bromeales or Bromhals, but passed by marriage to the Davenports\r\nas far back as the reign of Edward III. From the sketches an idea of\r\nthe general rich character of the timber framing can be gathered.\r\nRivalling it in some respects, one may next mention Moreton or Little\r\nMoreton Hall, near the Staffordshire border. It is surrounded by a\r\nmoat spanned by a stone bridge, and sentinelled by a gatehouse of\r\nstriking proportions, through which one enters the courtyard, where the\r\nmany-angled bays at once arrest attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORETON OLD HALL: GATEHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nBy whom they were contrived or, at all events, actually constructed,\r\nand when, can be learned from the inscriptions carved above the upper\r\nwindows, which run thus:\r\n\r\n    “God is al in al thing.”\r\n\r\n “This windows whire made by William Moreton in the yeare of Oure Lorde\r\n mdlix.”\r\n\r\n “Richard Dale Carpeder made thies windows by the Grac of God.”\r\n\r\nVying with these charming bays in interest and importance, there is\r\noccupying the entire length of the main wing a magnificent room on the\r\ntopmost (the third) floor which, tradition has it, was graced by the\r\npresence of Queen Elizabeth, and danced in by her Majesty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORETON HALL. IN THE COURTYARD.]\r\n\r\nIt is at such places as Moreton Hall, with its fine ballroom, to quote\r\nsome reflections which resulted from an architect’s--the late Mr. H.\r\nTaylor, of Manchester--study of this old house, we see the provisions\r\nmade in the past for enjoying life in the country. In this old house\r\nthe disturbed state of former times is brought vividly to our minds\r\nif we have sufficiently narrow shoulders to creep through the sliding\r\npanel into the apartment which was a harbour of refuge for those\r\nwhose life was in danger. When hotly pursued, the fugitive escaped\r\ndown a sort of well and through an underground passage. At Moreton\r\nHall, built when Italian ideas were creeping into the country, it is\r\ninstructive to notice how the architect was apparently puzzled by the\r\nconflicting principles of our humble and beautiful Gothic and of the\r\nmore pretentious Italian style, _e.g._ the ballroom, which is on the\r\nthird storey, has an open-timbered, pointed roof, with a thrust upon\r\nthe walls. This thrust he evidently thought it not proper to counteract\r\nby buttresses as his brethren a hundred years before would have done,\r\nand from this cause the stability of the building has for some time\r\nbeen threatened. The inhabitants at Moreton, we cannot but feel, must\r\nhave been put to sore inconvenience many a time, inasmuch as no one\r\nhad then invented corridors, and so there are four or five staircases.\r\nThis arrangement must have been very disagreeable on a wet night, as\r\nthe bedrooms could only be reached from different sides of the building\r\nby crossing the courtyard with or without candles or lanterns. Much\r\nas one is tempted to linger at Moreton, there is that other member\r\nof the famous triad of half-timbered treasures on this side of the\r\nshire awaiting consideration--Adlington. This is the home of one of\r\nCheshire’s oldest families, in whose possession it has remained for\r\nmany centuries. Of considerable exterior interest and entered by\r\nan admirably-proportioned, two-storeyed porch, it is, however, the\r\ninterior of the great hall that constitutes its chief glory. A very\r\nnoticeable feature is the cove-shaped panelling that runs right across\r\none end and contains a large number of shields of arms of the various\r\nfamilies connected with the house of Legh.\r\n\r\nThe roof is of remarkably fine character with principals of hammer-beam\r\ndesign, and is a most effective and decorative piece of richly-moulded\r\ncarpentry and carved work; the whole having an obviously Gothic\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nUpon some other “memorials” in this part of the county, all deserving\r\nto be dealt with at length, a very brief reference is all that can be\r\nbestowed--the little priest’s house at Prestbury, with its quaint and\r\ncurious square-ended bays and four-way gables; Gawsworth Hall, now the\r\nrectory, with its remarkable three-storeyed octagonal bay; Handforth\r\nHall, displaying a finely carved doorway; Alderley Edge with its\r\nfarmhouse, “Eagle and Child” Inn, and cottages, with gables dressed out\r\nin the local fashion of draughtboard or chequered devices.\r\n\r\nOf these examples it may be said that, while they all may have a\r\ncertain family likeness, yet each possesses an individuality of its\r\nown, needing but a closer acquaintance for recognition and appreciation.\r\n\r\nTo pass to the opposite corner of the county, the Wirral. Contrary to\r\nwhat might have been expected, having regard to the fact that the\r\nwhole of this peninsula, “from Blacon Point to Hilbree,” was formerly\r\none continuous thickly-wooded tract, the region yields practically\r\nnothing of half-timbered work. The deforesting which took place under\r\nEdward III. may be mainly answerable for the absence alluded to.\r\n\r\nThis district did, however, once possess in a home of the Stanleys,\r\nHooton Hall, what Ormerod describes as “a very large quadrangular\r\nbuilding in timber,” and of which he gives an illustration. It was\r\ndemolished in 1778, and in its stead stands the present stone-built\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nMid and Southern Cheshire well make up for the Wirral’s shortcomings.\r\n\r\nTo cite but a couple, Carden Hall and Broxton Old Hall. The former must\r\nhave been a superb example, beautiful alike in situation and in itself;\r\nthough now somewhat marred by sundry modernisings. Its neighbour,\r\nBroxton, has undergone restoration, but retains a good amount of the\r\noriginal framing. As fairly representative of its kind, a detail of a\r\ngable is given, “_ab uno disce omnes_.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROXTON HALL.\r\nPART ELEVATION OF A GABLE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSeeing that several towns capable of supplying scores of opportunities\r\nfor pursuing our subject--_e.g._ Stockport, Sandbach, Middlewich, and\r\nNantwich--have been left out of sight, it is obvious that not a tithe\r\nof the county’s wealth has been touched upon in this slight survey.\r\n\r\nIf, however, none of these towns has been laid under tribute, a similar\r\ncourse with respect to the capital city would be indefensible.\r\n\r\nInasmuch, however, as Chester’s half-timbering has so often been\r\ndealt with from the standpoints of antiquary, artist, and architect,\r\nmore than an abbreviated review seems unrequired, and anything like a\r\ncomplete _catalogue raisonné_ uncalled for of the possessions of what\r\nmust once have been a veritable “black and white” city, and can still\r\nclaim to be one of the chief places for studying the style.\r\n\r\nChronologically the Chester timber buildings may not number any\r\nquite comparable to Shrewsbury’s “Butcher’s Row”; howbeit there is at\r\nleast one example running that noted Gothic specimen fairly close, as\r\nregards age, at all events--the house at the corner of Castle Street\r\nbeing probably one, if not _the_ earliest--(_pace_ a placard on the\r\nseventeenth-century house in Lower Bridge Street proclaiming _it_ to\r\nbe the oldest house, adding a mere matter of 600 years by converting\r\nthe figure six on the beam into a nought! and by this doctored date\r\nduping, it is to be feared, many an unsuspecting visitor!).\r\n\r\nThis corner house is closely associated with the names of those Chester\r\nworthies, the Randle Holmes, of heraldic and antiquarian renown. An\r\nexamination of the mouldings and other details of this house points to\r\nit having been erected in Tudor times.\r\n\r\nHappily still confronting us in Lower Bridge Street is that old\r\nhostelry known as the “Falcon,” and also “The Bear and Billet,” once\r\nthe town house of the Earls of Shrewsbury and Talbot. The former has\r\na most engagingly picturesque appearance, with an effective row of\r\nquatrefoils under the range of many-mullioned windows. Looking at the\r\nproportion of the fronts of both these buildings taken up by their\r\nranges of windows, stretching from side to side, brings to mind that\r\nDerbyshire doggerel, coined to suit a somewhat like case--\r\n\r\n    “Hardwick Hall, more glass than wall.”\r\n\r\nSome reference must be made to the famous fronts in Watergate Street,\r\nwhere is “God’s Providence House.” About the only piece of the original\r\ntimber-work remaining is the beam with the inscription reminiscent of\r\nthe plague, which in 1647 so ravaged the city.\r\n\r\nLower down the street is “Bishop Lloyd’s Palace” with its series of\r\npanels containing interesting and quaint renderings of sacred subjects.\r\nFurther down the street one comes to Stanley Palace, which now has no\r\nfrontage to the street, and hides the attraction of a fine flank up a\r\npassage. This is a notable specimen of Jacobean Renaissance as applied\r\nto timber work, showing but few traces of the almost forgotten Gothic\r\nwhich dictated its construction.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor examples may be mentioned a row of quaint little\r\ndwellings in Park Street facing the city walls. Of these “Nine Houses”\r\nbut six are now standing. They have suffered from the insertion of\r\nincongruous sash windows, but this has not deprived them of all their\r\ninterest. One may still admire the handiwork of the old carpenters who\r\nthere so effectively employed the billet-moulds to the timbers and the\r\nchevron cutting on the beams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE: WHITEFRIARS: CHESTER.]\r\n\r\nExemplifying a later manner and different treatment, the house in\r\nWhitefriars is reserved as the last of this brief review. This bit of\r\nseventeenth century work with its widely overhanging upper portion,\r\nand the raised plaster ornament in the gables, with the date 1658, may\r\nclaim to be regarded as not the least interesting of the “memorials” we\r\nhave been considering.\r\n\r\nThose who esteem the half-timbered work as among the county’s chief\r\nantiquarian attractions and architectural assets--indeed all who feel\r\nthe fascination of the style--cannot but welcome the reversion to the\r\ntype and the revival of the manner in recent years.\r\n\r\nAmong the patrons of the building arts none was more susceptible\r\nto the peculiar charm of this “nogging-work” than the late Duke of\r\nWestminster, who caused to be erected on his Eaton estate numerous\r\nbuildings faithfully reproducing the forms and features of their\r\nCheshire prototypes. In this work his Grace was fortunate in having\r\nat command the services of an architect, Mr. John Douglas, than whom\r\nno one has been more successful in recapturing the spirit of the old\r\ntimber-work. To the late Duke’s liking for and desire to keep up the\r\n“Cheshire style” of architecture, Chester itself owes much that has\r\nbeen done towards preserving and also perpetuating the traditional\r\ncharacter of its buildings. It is a matter for congratulation that the\r\nlead given has been so loyally followed, both by the Corporation and\r\nby the citizens. Another notable instance of revival is to be seen at\r\nBidston Court in the Wirral; when this fine half-timbered house was\r\nbuilt a few years ago, an actual and accurate reproduction of those\r\nbays at Old Moreton Hall was embodied therein.\r\n\r\nBy way of summing up the subject, the following words from Ruskin may\r\nperhaps be not out of place:--\r\n\r\n “If indeed there be any profit in our knowledge of the past, or any\r\n joy in the thought of being remembered hereafter, which can give\r\n strength to present exertion or patience to present endurance, there\r\n are two duties respecting national architecture whose importance it is\r\n impossible to overrate: the first, to render the architecture of the\r\n day historical; and, the second, to preserve, as the most precious of\r\n inheritance, that of past ages.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  AN OLD CONSISTORY COURT\r\n\r\n  By the Archdeacon of Chester\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title of this chapter may possibly suggest to the reader that\r\nit will unfold some startling records of the proceedings which have\r\nbeen enacted in one of those ecclesiastical institutions called a\r\nConsistory Court. Let me at once dispel such anticipation. Though a\r\nsearch into the dusty documents which have accumulated might reveal\r\nsome interesting details of some _cause célèbre_, and disclose and hand\r\non to future generations some forgotten page of history, my purpose is\r\nmuch less ambitious, for it is rather with the building and interior\r\narrangement of the Court than with its legal proceedings that I propose\r\nto deal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features of Chester Cathedral is, that it\r\ngives us specimens of every style of architecture, except, indeed,\r\nthe Saxon. You have Norman work in the remains of S. Anselm’s Church\r\nand buildings; exquisite examples of Early English in the Lady Chapel\r\nand Chapter House; Decorated and Perpendicular of every period in the\r\nChoir, Nave, and great South Transept; and Jacobean in the Consistory\r\nCourt and in some minor details. It is of the latter that we are about\r\nto treat.\r\n\r\nThe visitor to the Cathedral, as he enters by the south-west porch,\r\nmay see on his left a plain nail-studded door, reached by three steps,\r\nand set in a stone screen surmounted by heavy ornamental masonry of\r\nthe date of the seventeenth century. The doorway and wall may have\r\nbeen built in the sixteenth century, when the unfinished south-west\r\ntower was projected and commenced, but the superincumbent balustrade\r\nis at any rate later, and bears the date 1636, and on a small shield\r\nthe initials “J. B.”--clear indication that it was erected by John\r\nBridgman, who was Bishop of Chester from 1619 to 1650. It is through\r\nthis door that the Consistory Court, which is, in fact, the basement\r\nof the unfinished tower, is reached. Comparatively few visitors to the\r\nCathedral ever see this portion of it. One reason for this may be that\r\nit is not under the complete control of the Dean and Chapter like the\r\nrest of the building. The Consistory Court is the Bishop’s Court, and\r\nthe papers contained therein are under his jurisdiction, and it would\r\nnot do for the general public to be admitted indiscriminately, unless\r\nthey were stored in safe receptacles. A Consistory Court implies a\r\nBishop; in fact, “a consistory is the court of a Bishop, in which the\r\nprinciple is that he is surrounded by representatives of the clergy\r\nof his diocese, who act as his council. In modern times, however, the\r\nConsistory Courts of Bishops are held by deputy, the Chancellor of\r\nthe diocese or one of his surrogates being the sole representatives\r\nof the Bishop and clergy.” Until the foundation of the See of Chester\r\nin 1541 there would, of course, be no Consistory Court in Chester,\r\nunless, indeed, the Bishop of Lichfield, who at one time had a throne\r\nor seat in S. John’s Church, ever had one there. When the Abbey Church\r\nbecame the Cathedral of the new See, it would seem that the Lady Chapel\r\nwas used as the Consistory Court. At any rate it was here that George\r\nMarsh was tried and condemned to death in 1554, when George Cotes was\r\nBishop. In _The Life of Bridgman_ there is an allusion to this original\r\nposition of the Court, when it is stated that Mrs. Bridgman was buried\r\n“at the east end of the church, next to the _old_ Consistory Court,\r\nwhich is now called our Ladye’s Chapel.” Whether the Court was moved\r\nto the place it now occupies before Bishop Bridgman’s time, I cannot\r\nsay. He, at any rate, put up the screen (or the upper portion of it)\r\nwhich separates it from the south aisle, as is shown by the date and\r\nby the arms of the Bridgman family. The Bishop was responsible for\r\nmany repairs and improvements in the Cathedral, and “in the Pallace\r\nof the Bishop which was in great decay”; and in a manuscript in the\r\nUniversity Library at Cambridge, there is a full and interesting\r\naccount of what he did in this respect. Curiously enough no mention\r\nis made of this screen or of the fittings of the Court, and yet both\r\nundoubtedly were due to him, and erected in his time. He may have\r\nrightly thought that the basement of this tower at the west end of the\r\nchurch was a more seemly and fitting place for the holding of a Court,\r\neven though the business conducted there was ecclesiastical, than the\r\nchapel at the east, which was designed and used for the most sacred\r\noffices of religion. It may be said here that it is not an uncommon\r\nthing for the Consistory Court to be a portion of the Cathedral. This\r\nis the case at Carlisle, Durham, Chichester, Hereford, Lichfield,\r\nLlandaff, Peterborough, Ripon, and Winchester (and this list may not\r\nbe exhaustive), though the exact position of the Court in the church\r\nvaries considerably.\r\n\r\nOn entering the Court, the visitor cannot fail to be struck with the\r\nold-world scene before him as he looks upon the fittings, which were\r\nput up 270 years ago. There is a square enclosure, surrounded by a\r\npartition of oak some four feet high. To this there are entrance-doors\r\nat each corner. Inside a seat is fixed all round this partition, the\r\ncentral space being filled with a large square table covered with a\r\ngreen cloth. At the west side, reached by three steps, is the raised\r\nseat for the Chancellor, with a desk in front of it. The seat is\r\nsufficiently wide for two persons, so that the Chancellor might have\r\nan assessor by his side. The judgment-seat is flanked on either side\r\nby another seat with a smaller desk before it. It is rendered imposing\r\nby an elongated oak canopy with a carved cornice and by the Jacobean\r\npanelling which supports it. The cornice is, unfortunately, not quite\r\nperfect. A portion is missing on the south side, and on the north\r\na piece has been cut away. The arms of the Bridgman family are to be\r\nseen in one of the centre panels, thus proving that the Bishop was\r\nresponsible for its erection, and on the imperfect panel on the north\r\nside are the letters\r\n\r\n  EDM\r\n  CAN^.\r\n\r\nThese, no doubt, refer to Edmund Mainwaring, LL.D., who is styled by\r\nSir Peter Leycester, “Chancellor of Chester in 1642,” though his patent\r\nis not in the office. It shows that the seat was intended for the\r\nChancellor, and that it was originally constructed for the position\r\nit now occupies. At the north-east corner of the enclosure is a\r\nperched-up seat resting on the top of the oak partition which surrounds\r\nthe enclosure. Any person who sat in it would have to mount upon the\r\nseat which surrounds the table, and to use it as a resting-place\r\nfor his feet. It does not look a very safe position. We are left to\r\nconjecture for whom this seat was intended. It may have been for the\r\ndefendant (perhaps a notorious evil-doer) in ecclesiastical suits or\r\nfor the witness who was to be examined. In either case the seat was\r\nan uncomfortable one, and the occupant would certainly be under close\r\nobservation. As we look upon these fittings, black with the lapse of\r\nyears, one is tempted to think how much they would be improved by\r\ncareful and judicious cleaning. The seat referred to is evidently of\r\nthe same date as the other fittings, but it is never occupied now,\r\nthough the Court is used regularly, and the Chancellor or his deputy\r\nsits on days duly advertised to hear applications for faculties. It\r\nmay be doubted whether there is any other Court in England which has\r\na similar experience, and of which it can be said that the seating\r\nand arrangements are identical with what existed nearly 300 years\r\nago. I have been told that there is one of the same kind at Lincoln:\r\nif that be so, the Chester Consistory Court cannot claim to be an\r\nabsolutely unique example. The Consistory Court at Lichfield, which\r\nis under St. Chad’s Chapel in the south aisle of the Choir, and is\r\nprobably the oldest part of the building, has in it some curious old\r\nJacobean woodwork, but this is part of the stall work put up after\r\n1661. The Court has been presided over for many years by the Worshipful\r\nChancellor Espin, one of the two clerical Diocesan Chancellors at\r\nthe present time. I am indebted to him for the following:--“I do not\r\nknow of any other Court which has preserved its ancient character as\r\nours has. I suspect that some, perhaps many, of the Consistory Courts\r\nin the older dioceses have been dismantled. Some years ago, when\r\nBishop Hobhouse was Chancellor of the Diocese of Lichfield, I went to\r\nstay with him. He told me that he had been touring about the West of\r\nEngland, and among other places had lionised Gloucester Cathedral.\r\nHaving been taken round by the verger, he asked next to see the\r\nConsistory Court. The verger had never heard of it, and said there was\r\nno such place there. Hobhouse insisted, and after some altercation\r\nan old verger was sent for who had retired on a pension, and was\r\nmouldering away somewhere hard by. He did remember, but said the Court\r\nhad never been used for many years, in fact, not since 1856. When\r\nHobhouse was taken to the place, he found that all the fittings had\r\nbeen cleared away, and it was made a receptacle for coals and lumber.\r\nAlas for the judicature of England! I believe the ancient ‘Alma Curia\r\nde Arcubus’ (Court of Arches) is now a cheesemonger’s warehouse.” The\r\nCourt still retains some relics of its old procedure. The official\r\nwho opens and adjourns the Court, and who cites all objectors to an\r\napplication to appear, always begins with the formula, “Oyez, Oyez!”\r\ncarefully pronounced as “Oh yes, Oh yes!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Consistory Court, Chester Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nIt has been stated above that the Court is under Episcopal control,\r\nand so is not generally seen by visitors to the Cathedral. Any one,\r\nhowever, who is desirous of seeing this “Memorial of Old Cheshire”\r\ncan do so by applying to the verger in attendance, and will be repaid\r\nby his visit, as it is extremely doubtful whether anywhere in England\r\nsuch a venerable specimen of the accessories of a legal court of olden\r\ndays can be found. The visitor, if gifted with a lively imagination,\r\nmay people the Court with persons of a former generation, and call up\r\nin fancy some keenly-contested suit in connection with Ecclesiastical\r\ndiscipline, or some matrimonial or probate cause. If it should\r\nhappen that the Court is sitting, he may see the Chancellor hearing\r\napplications for faculties, and may possibly note the opposition which\r\nis sometimes raised; but he will not be likely to witness such a scene\r\nof excitement as recently marked the Consistory Court of a southern\r\ndiocese. He must be content with hearing the judge give his decision,\r\nit may be after a few explanatory remarks, in the words: “The Faculty\r\nis decreed in terms of the Citation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  HALTON COURT LEET\r\n\r\n  By V. B. Davies\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Halton Castle.]\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting little village called Halton on the northerly\r\nborder of Cheshire, about two and a half miles from Runcorn; but as it\r\nis not on the high road to anywhere in particular, it is little known\r\nand seldom visited by strangers. It is interesting because of the ruins\r\nof an old castle which are there. This castle is situated on a high\r\nhill commanding an extensive view over a large part of Cheshire and\r\nacross the river Mersey (which is of considerable width at this point)\r\ninto Lancashire. Halton Castle is of very ancient date. It was built\r\nby Hugh Lupus, first Earl of Chester, soon after the Norman Conquest,\r\nand the manor and fee of Halton descended to Henry the Fourth, since\r\nwhen it has been annexed to the Crown, except during the time of the\r\nProtectorate of Cromwell, when it was put up for sale by auction and\r\npurchased by Henry Brooke of Halton, a predecessor of the present Sir\r\nRichard Brooke. On the restoration of the monarchy it reverted back to\r\nthe Crown, and at this day it belongs to the King, who, as the Duke of\r\nLancaster, is Lord of the Manor.\r\n\r\nIn former days the stewards of this manor were officials of\r\nconsiderable importance, and one of the early stewards was John of\r\nGaunt, Duke of Lancaster. The late Mr. William Beamont and Mr. Robert\r\nDavies of Warrington were stewards in more recent years. On the death\r\nof the latter gentleman in 1902, Mr. Bolden, one of the officials\r\nin the Duke of Lancaster’s office in London, was appointed steward,\r\nand Mr. Vere Beamont Davies and Mr. Herbert Hatton of Warrington were\r\nappointed deputy stewards, and this arrangement holds good at the\r\npresent time. In connection with this manor there is a court of very\r\nancient origin, termed the Halton Court Leet, held at the castle, and\r\nover which the deputy steward presides. The earliest records of the\r\ncourt are dated 1347, in the time of Edward III.; but it is believed\r\nthe court goes back for a period of about 660 years. The court formerly\r\nhad a very extensive jurisdiction and a variety of duties to perform,\r\nbut at the present time it has been superseded by the county courts and\r\nmagistrates’ courts, and its powers have passed away.\r\n\r\nThe court rolls were formerly kept in a large chest at Halton Castle,\r\nbut have now been removed to London. The late Mr. William Beamont gives\r\na very interesting account of these rolls in his book, _An Account of\r\nthe Rolls of the Honour of Halton_, and sets out numerous extracts\r\ndetailing the work performed by the Court Leet in former days. The\r\nfollowing are some of them, and will, we think, be of interest to our\r\nreaders:--\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 5 Ed. IV. the inquest at the court make this short return, “Nil\r\npresentant propter breve tempus.”\r\n\r\nAt the Halton Court held in 4 Hen. VIII., 1512, Elizabeth Heath,\r\nservant to John Blinsten, and Agnes, wife of John Owen, were found to\r\nbe common carriers away of the poles of the park, and were fined for\r\nit; and Agnes was further charged with stealing the racks placed in the\r\npark to hold the hay which had been placed there for the King’s deer\r\n(_feris_).\r\n\r\nIn 1544 the jury at Thelwall presented Robert Bold and Thomas Heypey\r\nfor keeping cards “talos [dice] et alia joca illicita,” in their\r\nhouses, “contra firmam statuti.”\r\n\r\nIn 1559 a tenant was presented at the court for not ringing his swine.\r\n\r\nIn 1608 John Lawton was fined 3s. 4d. for allowing Thomas Whiteley to\r\nremain tippling in his house, which it is presumed was public, for one\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nIn 1655 a man was fined for suffering his wife to fight and draw blood.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday before St. George’s Day, 4 Hen. VIII., 1512, William Hicson\r\nwas excused attending at the Manor Court because he was going with the\r\nKing on his wars in France. This man probably went with the Marquis of\r\nDorset’s unfortunate expedition, with which, however, the King did not\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nIn the 42 Edward III., 1370, Hamon de Warburton is fined by the court\r\nfor taking a hare in the lord’s warren at Whitley. The warren here\r\nspoken of must mean the lord’s free warren, for hares are not, like\r\nrabbits, confined in an enclosed warren.\r\n\r\nIn 1507 the jury at the Halton Court held at Thelwall presented John\r\nBollyng of Warrington, yeoman, for that he on 1 February, and on divers\r\nother days as well before as after at Appleton and elsewhere within the\r\nfee of Halton with greyhounds and other dogs (cum greybitches venaticis\r\net aliis canibus) was a common hunter “vi et armis,” not having lands\r\nand tenements to the value of xls. a year, and, it is added, “nil habet\r\nideo capiatur.”\r\n\r\nIn 1512, at the Runcorn halmote, the jury, as we have before mentioned,\r\npresented William Runcorn of Runcorn, chaplain, for that he not being\r\nbeneficed to xls. a year did keep a hare hound and was a common hunter.\r\n\r\nIn 1380 one William Harper, who had been tried at Chester and found\r\nguilty of the murder of Adam Mushet, was brought back to Halton and\r\nthere hanged by the bailiff, and the lord of the fee received six pence\r\nfor the value of his goods.\r\n\r\nIn 1450 six or more persons were charged with feloniously entering and\r\nbreaking into a dwelling-house at Halton and stealing thereout money\r\nand goods.\r\n\r\nIn 1474 there is a notice of a more serious charge. Two Welshmen from\r\nMold having committed a burglary at Keckwick, and stolen thereout,\r\namong other articles, a sheaf of arrows, and having been committed for\r\nit, broke out of the castle, taking with them their fetters and chains,\r\nwhich must have helped to discover them, for they were soon afterwards\r\nretaken and tried before Thomas, Lord Stanley, the seneschal, and,\r\nbeing found guilty, were hanged at Halton.\r\n\r\nAt the Widnes Court in 4 Hen. VIII., 1512, Robert Woodfall was charged\r\nwith walking at night through the King Street in Farnworth in front of\r\nthe houses of the King’s tenants, and with force and arms, namely, a\r\nstaff and a dagger, calling out “Whoever wishes to fight me, let him\r\ncome out,” whereby the King’s subjects were disturbed and put in fear;\r\nwherefore he was fined by the court.\r\n\r\nIn the same year three persons were presented for _lucrum excessivum_,\r\nby which it is supposed usury was meant; though in 1375 some butchers\r\nwere presented _quia ceperunt lucrum excessivum_, meaning that they had\r\ncharged too much. In 1512 some men were presented for using bows and\r\narrows to drive a man off some land where he was digging turf.\r\n\r\nIn 1544 one George Amery of Barnton was presented for that he did keep\r\nand harbour crows in his grounds and did permit them to build in his\r\nwoods, to the injury of the country and contrary to the statute in such\r\ncase made and provided.\r\n\r\nOn October 3, 1561, Helena Ditchfield was charged with a trespass in\r\npulling down her neighbours’ fences.\r\n\r\nIn 1593, a grievous murder having been committed at Grappenhall Heath\r\non the person of John Findley, a hawker of Scottish cloth, the crime\r\nwas brought home to one William Geston, a servant of the Bishop of\r\nChester. The jury at Halton presented the fact, and the prisoner,\r\nhaving been tried for it and convicted at Chester Assizes, was hanged\r\nin chains on April 27, 1593, near the spot where the murder was\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nIn 1608 one Stockton was presented for selling ale without the\r\njustices’ licence, and taking in and entertaining irregular and\r\npernicious persons to the disturbance of his neighbours, and one Lawton\r\nfor permitting a man to tipple in his house for one hour was fined 3s.\r\n4d., and Charles Hall for taking in inmates was fined 6s. 8d.\r\n\r\nOn January 16, 1660, Roger Drakeford, who had conveyed a prisoner to\r\nSir Peter Leycester’s (the great Cheshire antiquary), a journey of\r\nfourteen miles, was paid 3s. 6d. for himself and his horse, a small sum\r\nfor so long a journey.\r\n\r\nIn 1388 the Prior of Norton was charged with making two fish-yards\r\nin the Mersey, one called Gracedieu and the other Charity, which\r\nobstructed the passage of the lord’s boat of eight oars from Fresh Pool\r\nto Thelwall.\r\n\r\nIn 1598 the jury found that Robert Dutton of Preston did fish in Thomas\r\nDutton’s pit and did take his fish in the daytime without leave or\r\nlicence from him, and therefore they did amerce him.\r\n\r\nIn 1605 the court complained of the number of the fish-yards at\r\nThelwall and of the encroachments they made on the river.\r\n\r\nOn October 8, 1655, the old complaint of the river being obstructed by\r\nfish-yards was again renewed.\r\n\r\nIn 1655 a number of persons were presented and fined for keeping up\r\ntheir weirs and fish-yards in the mid-stream of the Mersey so that the\r\nLord of the fee could not pass by the “key” of Thelwall with boats and\r\nbarges.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the Court in former days had a wide and\r\nextensive jurisdiction and dealt with a variety of matters. Nowadays,\r\nas before stated, the court has no powers, but the court is held by the\r\ndeputy steward at the Castle, or rather at the Castle Hotel adjoining\r\nthe ruins, once every three years, simply to keep up the old custom,\r\nand for the sake of past memories. A jury summons signed by the Bailiff\r\nof the Court in the following form:--\r\n\r\n =Manor and Fee of Halton=, in the County of Chester, TO WIT.\r\n\r\n By Virtue of a Precept to me directed, I hereby require you personally\r\n to be and appear at a Court Leet and View of Frank Pledge and Court\r\n Baron to be held at Halton Castle, according to the custom there time\r\n immemorial used and approved, on Saturday, the      day of at the hour\r\n of      to be upon the Jury there.\r\n\r\n Herein fail not at your peril.\r\n\r\n =Witness= my hand at Halton aforesaid, this      day of      19\r\n\r\n                                              Bailiff of the said Court.\r\n\r\nis sent to the Overseers of the following townships:--\r\n\r\nAston juxta Budworth, Aston juxta Sutton, Appleton, Antrobus, Astmore,\r\nBarnton, Bartington, Bexton, Budworth (Great), Comberbach, Cotton,\r\nChurch Hulme (Holmes Chapel), Cogshall, Crowley, Daresbury, Halton,\r\nHatton, Kekewick, Lymm, Millington, Newton juxta Daresbury, Preston\r\no’th Hill, Sutton, Stretton, Seven Oaks, Toft, Tabley (Over), Weston,\r\nWalton Superior, Walton Inferior, Whitley Superior, Whitley Inferior.\r\n\r\nA jury is appointed, and sworn in by the deputy steward, and a\r\nconstable and two burleymen are appointed.\r\n\r\nThe following is the form of oath administered to the foreman and rest\r\nof the jury:--\r\n\r\n “You as foreman of this inquest, with the rest of your fellows, shall\r\n duly inquire and true presentment make of all such matters and things\r\n as relate to the present service, wherein you shall spare no man for\r\n fear, love, favour, or affection, nor present any man out of malice or\r\n hatred, but according as things here presentable shall come to your\r\n knowledge, by information or otherwise, so shall you make thereof true\r\n presentment without concealment. So help you God.”\r\n\r\nBefore the opening of the court by the deputy steward, the bailiff\r\nmakes the following proclamation:--\r\n\r\n “Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! All manner of persons who owe suit and service to\r\n this Court Leet and view of Frankpledge and Court Baron of His Most\r\n Gracious Majesty the King, as Duke of Lancaster, Baron of Halton, and\r\n paramount Lord of this Manor and Fee, draw near, give your attendance,\r\n and answer to your names.”\r\n\r\nNo business is, of course, transacted, and the proceedings finish up\r\nwith a dinner, over which the deputy steward presides.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, the court must have had jurisdiction over a wide\r\narea, as the jurors are summoned from Barnton, near Northwich, and\r\nfrom Toft and Tabley, near Knutsford, and also from Holmes Chapel. It\r\nis also evident from the extracts from Mr. Beamont’s book that minor\r\ncourts were held in connection with the Halton Court at a variety of\r\nplaces, and it is also to be noticed that the jurisdiction of the court\r\nextended across the river Mersey into Lancashire, and that courts were\r\nheld at Widnes and Farnworth. In fact, there is the Manor of Widnes,\r\ncomprising land on the Lancashire side of the river, which also belongs\r\nto the Duchy of Lancaster, and of which the King is the lord, and it is\r\npresumed the jurisdiction of the court would extend over the area of\r\nthis manor.\r\n\r\nIn some remarks on the last Court Leet, held in December 1908, the\r\n_Warrington Guardian_ stated:\r\n\r\n “That the Widnes or Farnworth Leet, which was subject to Halton,\r\n had the power to mete out only four punishments. These included\r\n the pillory, an ignominious punishment; and the cuck-stool or\r\n ducking-chair, for punishing a scold, of whose unruly member it was\r\n said:\r\n\r\n    ‘Of members the tongue is the worst and the best,\r\n     And an ill tongue sows often the seeds of unrest.’\r\n\r\n To curb the tongue, they had also the brank, an iron bridle which\r\n kept the tongue quiet by more mechanical means. The court had\r\n also the stocks, the constable’s prison as it was called, and the\r\n whipping-post, but the Farnworth or Widnes Leet, though allied\r\n to Halton, had not the power which Halton certainly possessed of\r\n inflicting the punishment of death.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to its powers of punishment, there is no doubt that, prior\r\nto the days of printing and when only few people could read or write,\r\nthe court was used as a means of making public proclamations, and that\r\npresentments were made to it of matters of general interest to the\r\npeople which otherwise could not have been brought to their knowledge.\r\nTo-day we have our telegraphs and telephones, our newspapers and our\r\nbooks, and all other ways of letting every one know everything. Who\r\nshall say which were the happier days?\r\n\r\n    “Let the great world spin for ever\r\n     Down the ringing grooves of change.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we may remark that there is another relic of old times\r\nin connection with the Manor of Halton, in that part of the land\r\nthere, and also in the Manor of Widnes before referred to, is still of\r\ncopyhold tenure, and the ordinary laws of conveyancing do not apply to\r\nit. For instance, a conveyance of land is carried out by way of what\r\nis called a Surrender and Admission and a mortgage by a Conditional\r\nSurrender, and the deeds have to be signed by the parties before the\r\ndeputy steward. These deeds are all entered on the court rolls of the\r\nmanor, the originals being sent to the Duchy Office in London, and\r\ncopies are kept at the office of the deputy steward, and other copies\r\nhanded to the parties dealing with the property.\r\n\r\nThis mode of transfer of the land is cumbersome and expensive, and\r\nis gradually dying out, for any copyholder can apply to the Duchy of\r\nLancaster to have his land enfranchised, and on the payment of certain\r\nfees he obtains a conveyance of same from the King, as Lord of the\r\nManor, and the property then becomes his absolute freehold, and is\r\ndealt with afterwards like any other property. The seal of the Duchy\r\nof Lancaster is always affixed to the enfranchisement deeds, and is so\r\nlarge that it has to be attached to the deed by a strip of parchment\r\nand kept in a tin box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHESHIRE WORTHIES\r\n\r\n  By P. H. Ditchfield, M.A., F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheshire, the “seed-plot of gentility,” as Speed loved to call his\r\nnative shire, can boast of many illustrious sons who have conferred\r\nhonour on their county. A large volume would be needed wherein to\r\nchronicle all their achievements, their deeds of prowess, their\r\nsuccesses as poets, divines, lawyers, and philosophers. We can only\r\nrecord the names of the most illustrious Cestrians who have achieved\r\nfame in various professions and are worthy of a niche in these\r\nmemorials of the county.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS\r\n\r\nCheshire men have always been good fighters. They have played their\r\npart bravely on many a battlefield at home and abroad, and honour\r\nshall first be done to the soldiers of the shire. In civil war there\r\nwas little unity amongst the gentlemen of Cheshire. They fought with,\r\nor against, each other as party faction or inclination dictated; but\r\nagainst the enemies of England they were formidable foes. The great\r\nCivil War that raged between King and Parliament brought most of these\r\nCheshire soldiers into prominence, and most of the names on our list of\r\nwarriors are connected with that period.\r\n\r\nIn the wars with France when the third King Edward reigned, Cheshire\r\nmen showed well the stuff they were made of, their valour and bravery\r\nin arms. Foremost amongst their number in this group of early warriors\r\nstands Sir Thomas Danyers, who fought gallantly in the battle of Crecy\r\nunder the banner of the Black Prince. He plunged into the thickest of\r\nthe fight, and when the King bade his son “win his spurs and the honour\r\nof the day for himself,” Sir Thomas “relieved the banner of his Earl\r\nand took prisoner the Chamberlain of France, de Tankerville.” For this\r\ngallant feat of arms the Prince rewarded the Cheshire knight with a\r\ngoodly sum of money, and the promise of the grant of an estate in his\r\nnative county. This promise was not fulfilled until after the warrior’s\r\ndeath, when the fair lands of Lyme were bestowed upon his daughter, who\r\nhad married Sir Piers Legh; and thus the famous family of the Leighs of\r\nLyme began their existence, and happily the connection still survives\r\nafter the lapse of many centuries.\r\n\r\nAnother brave soldier of the period was Sir John Delves, who with\r\nhis companions in arms contributed greatly to the glorious victory\r\nof Poictiers. That fight was memorable for Cheshire men. The gallant\r\nJames, Lord Audley, a native of the shire, though he lived in\r\nStaffordshire, had for his four squires, John Delves, Dutton of Dutton,\r\nFoulshurst of Crewe, and Hawkeston of Wrine Hall, a Cheshire man though\r\nresiding in Staffordshire. When the battle day dawned Audley vowed to\r\nbe foremost in the field and lead the attack, and “with the ayde of\r\nhis four scuyers dyd marvels in arms, and foughte always in the cheyfe\r\nof the batyle; y^t day he never toke prisoner, but always foughte and\r\nwente on his enemyes.” He was sorely wounded, and was borne from the\r\nfield by his faithful squires. For his bravery the Prince made him\r\na grant of five hundred marks a year for ever. This reward the good\r\nknight handed over to his squires, saying that they had deserved it as\r\nmuch as he, and had more need of it. So the Prince gave him a second\r\ngrant of a like amount. Audley, as a further reward to his squires,\r\nordered that they should bear on their coats of arms his own proper\r\nachievement, gules a fret, d’or. Sir John Delves purchased Doddington,\r\nnear Nantwich, where he erected a goodly mansion in 1364, and where the\r\nstatues of himself and his brave companions, carved in later times,\r\ncould be seen. There is an alabaster effigy of Sir Robert Foulshurst,\r\none of the gallant squires, in Barthomley Church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Hugh Calveley’s Tomb, Bunbury Church.]\r\n\r\nSir Hugh Calveley sleeps at Bunbury, a mighty hero of the French wars\r\nwho fought under the brave leader Sir John Chandos. You can see his\r\nfine alabaster tomb, a lion couching at his feet, and his crest, a\r\ncalf’s head, which he bore on many a foreign battlefield. Fuller says\r\nof him: “Tradition makes him a man of teeth and hands, who would feed\r\nas much as two, and fight as much as ten men; his quick and strong\r\nappetite could digest anything but an injury, so that the killing a man\r\nis reported the cause of his quitting this country, making hence for\r\nLondon and France. Here he became a most eminent soldier.” It were vain\r\nto tell of all his exploits. He fought in Brittany in 1357, at Auray\r\nin 1364, Navarete in 1367, in Brittany again with Sir John Arundell in\r\n1380, when the expedition was almost entirely destroyed by a storm and\r\n20,000 men perished. Many of these warriors lived a wild and turbulent\r\nlife during the wars, and Sir Hugh, perhaps repenting of his deeds, in\r\nhis old age converted the Parish Church of Bunbury into a collegiate\r\nchurch, with a master and six chaplains to pray for his soul. One of\r\nhis companions in arms was Sir Robert Knowles, born of mean parentage\r\nin Cheshire, but brave and valiant. He fought with Sir Hugh Calveley in\r\nBrittany in 1351, when thirty Englishmen encountered the like number of\r\nBretons and were sorely worsted. The ruined castles that he left behind\r\nhim in France were termed “Knowles’s Mitres.” His last service to his\r\ncountry was the suppression of Wat Tyler’s rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe Wars of the Roses claimed some Cheshire victims. On the bloody\r\nfield of Blore Heath, when the Earl of Salisbury defeated Lord Audley\r\nand the Yorkists on September 25, 1459, fell Sir Robert Booth, the\r\nancestor of the Booth family of Dunham Massey. His brass memorial,\r\nwith that of his wife, the heiress of that estate, is in the church\r\nat Wilmslow. Sir William Stanley, second son of the first Lord\r\nStanley, in the time of Henry VII. held Ridley, being Chamberlain of\r\nCheshire. He distinguished himself at the battle of Bosworth, rescuing\r\nHenry from great peril and saving his life. He was the first to set\r\nthe crown of England on King Henry’s head, after it had been found on\r\nthe battlefield trampled under the feet of the fighters. A gratified\r\nmonarch bestowed upon him wealth and honour, but he was accused of\r\nfavouring the design of Perkin Warbeck, and perished on the scaffold.\r\nHis manor of Ridley was forfeited to the Crown and given to another\r\ndistinguished soldier, Sir Ralph Egerton, who fought bravely at the\r\nbattle of the Spurs, and at the siege of Terouenne and Tournay,\r\ncapturing the standard of the French. He also fought at Flodden Field,\r\nand was appointed royal standard-bearer of England, a high distinction\r\nnobly earned. He lies in the church at Bunbury, and from him descended\r\nthe lines of the Earls and Dukes of Bridgewater.\r\n\r\nOf the brave men of Elizabethan times we may mention the Cheshire\r\nwarrior Sir Uryan Legh, of the Leghs of Adlington, who, present at the\r\ntaking of Cadiz under the leadership of the Earl of Essex in 1590,\r\nwas knighted for his gallantry, and in the time of James I. became\r\nSheriff of Cheshire. You can see his portrait at Bramall Hall attired\r\nin Spanish dress, in which, according to an old ballad, he wrought\r\nmischief in the heart of a fair Spanish lady who made violent love\r\nto him, and could only be deterred by the somewhat lately imparted\r\nknowledge that Sir Uryan had already a wife. Sir George Beeston,\r\nanother gallant soldier, lies at Bunbury, where a fine monument records\r\nhis memory. He was one of those who, though advanced in years, took an\r\nactive part in defeating the Spanish Armada, and fought valiantly at\r\nthe siege of Boulogne.\r\n\r\nFiercely did the great Civil War rage in Cheshire, and fiercely did\r\nthe Cestrians fight. Foremost among them was Sir William Brereton, the\r\ngreat Cheshire leader of the Parliamentary army, and commander-in-chief\r\nof the Cheshire forces. The story of his fights is the history of the\r\nCivil War in this and the neighbouring counties, and cannot be told\r\nhere. His relative Lord Brereton, the owner of the seat Brereton, one\r\nof the finest mansions in the county, was a brave supporter of the\r\nRoyalist cause. Sir William lived to see the Restoration, and died at\r\nthe archiepiscopal palace at Croydon, which had been granted to him\r\nby the Parliament. Lord Brereton returned to his goodly house, but\r\nfamilies, alas! become extinct, and the name once so famous in Cheshire\r\nhistory now no longer exists save in memory.\r\n\r\nColonel Edward Massey, of the ancient family of the Masseys of\r\nCoddington, was a soldier of fortune who fought on both sides in the\r\nwar. He, however, threw in his lot with the enemies of the King, and\r\nwas made Governor of Gloucester. He held the city during the siege; but\r\non the triumph of the Independents his career was chequered, and he\r\nfound his way back to the King, and became Major-general in the Royal\r\narmy. History tells not when he died.\r\n\r\nAnother Parliamentary leader was Colonel Robert Dukinfield, of\r\nDukinfield, who came of an ancient Cheshire family. He defended\r\nStockport Bridge against Prince Rupert, laid siege to and captured\r\nWhiltenshaw, became Governor of Chester, took part in the disgraceful\r\ncourt-martial of the Earl of Derby, who was judicially murdered at\r\nBolton, and obtained the surrender by the Countess of the Derby estates\r\nin the Isle of Man. He wrote a delightful letter to Cromwell, in which\r\nhe tells the Protector that he firmly believes that the root of the\r\ntree of piety is alive in him, though the leaves thereof, through the\r\nabundance of temptations and flatterers, seemed to the writer to be\r\nwithered much of late, yet he hoped time and experience would have\r\na good influence upon his lordship, _Deo juvante_. This letter, and\r\nother outspoken words, did not endear Dukinfield to the Protector’s\r\nfollowers, who showed their distrust of him. However, he crushed\r\nthe abortive rising of Sir George Booth, and received the thanks\r\nof the Parliament and a reward for his services. He did not escape\r\npersecution at the Restoration, but the Royalists admired the staunch\r\nold Colonel, and the King made his son a baronet.\r\n\r\nThis Sir George Booth, who before the return of Charles II. was\r\nappointed commander-in-chief of the King’s forces in Cheshire,\r\nLancashire, and North Wales, and headed an abortive attempt to restore\r\nhis Majesty to the throne, was well rewarded for his services. After\r\nhis defeat he escaped in a woman’s habit, riding on a pillion behind\r\none of his grooms. But his sex was detected by the landlord of an\r\ninn where he sojourned, and he was captured and sent to the Tower.\r\nIn 1660 the House of Commons voted him £10,000 for his services in\r\neffecting the Restoration. He was created Baron Delamere of Dunham\r\nMassey, and was appointed Custos Rotulorum for the county. He died at\r\nDunham Massey, and was buried at Bowdon in 1673. In his attempt to\r\nregain the throne for Charles II. he was greatly assisted by Roger\r\nGrosvenor, ancestor of the Dukes of Westminster, who have always “stood\r\nby their pious principles of faith and loyalty,” as Randle Holme\r\ntruly testifies. His son, Sir Thomas, commanded a troop in the Earl\r\nof Shrewsbury’s regiment of horse in 1685, which encamped at Hounslow\r\nHeath, and he was offered a peerage by James II. for his answer to the\r\nrepeal of the Test Acts, a bribe which he had the courage to resist. He\r\nwas M.P. for Chester, Mayor of the city, and Sheriff of the county.\r\n\r\nThe Astons were unfortunate Royalists. Sir Thomas was defeated by Sir\r\nWilliam Brereton at Middlewich, and Sir Arthur, after being Governor\r\nof Reading, and earning the praise of his sovereign, who deemed that\r\n“there was not a man in his army of greater reputation, or one of whom\r\nthe enemy had greater dread,” lost his leg and then his life in the\r\nslaughter of the garrison of Tredagh, in Ireland. Two other gallant\r\nRoyalists must be mentioned, Sir Francis Gamul, of Buerton, who watched\r\nfrom the Phœnix Tower with the King the fatal fight of Rowton Heath,\r\nand helped him to escape from his enemies; and Sir Geoffrey Shakerley,\r\nwho performed many deeds of daring during the war; and at Rowton Heath,\r\nin order to convey a message to the King, crossed the Dee in a tub,\r\nholding the bridle of his horse, which was swimming at the side. He\r\nwas a good friend and servant of the King, Governor of the Castle of\r\nChester, and lies beneath his fine monument at Nether Peover Church.\r\n\r\nHenry Booth, Earl of Warrington and Baron Delamere, second son of\r\nBaron Delamere before mentioned, played as distinguished a part in the\r\nRevolution and in establishing William III. on the English throne as\r\nhis father had done for Charles II. A brave assertor of his country’s\r\nrights, and a defender of the Protestant religion, he fell foul of\r\nJames II., and was tried on a groundless charge of high treason, the\r\nnotorious Jefferies being his accuser. He escaped that peril, and soon\r\nraised an army in Cheshire and Lancashire to aid Dutch William. To\r\nhim fell the duty of telling the last Stuart king that he must leave\r\nWhitehall, treating the fallen monarch with a respect and deference\r\nthat touched his Majesty. Many honours were heaped upon him, including\r\nthe Earldom of Warrington and a pension of £2000 a year; but he did\r\nnot long enjoy his dignity, as death summoned him at the early age of\r\nforty-two years in 1693-4.\r\n\r\nColonel, and afterwards General, Werden risked his life and fortune for\r\nKing Charles, had to fly from the country, and continued with the royal\r\nfamily until the Restoration, after which he was appointed to several\r\noffices of trust, and was comptroller of the royal household. His son\r\nJohn was created a baronet, and held many important posts.\r\n\r\nSir Roger Mostyn, of Mostyn, Baronet, was a gallant soldier who raised\r\n1500 men for the King’s service, captured Hawarden Castle, was Governor\r\nof Flint Castle, which he maintained until the death of the King’s\r\ncause. His house of Mostyn was plundered, and he was imprisoned in\r\nConway Castle; at the Restoration a baronetcy was the reward of his\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nDoubtless Cheshire had many other brave soldiers, but this list must\r\nnow suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOPS\r\n\r\nThe county has seen many of her sons raised to the Episcopal Bench.\r\nForemost amongst these was the saintly Bishop Wilson of Mona’s Isle,\r\nwho was born of humble parents in the parish of Burton in the Wirral\r\ndistrict. Three years after the Restoration Thomas Wilson first saw\r\nthe light; his holy, wise, charitable, God-fearing life was a burning\r\nand a shining light in his age, and his influence spread far and wide.\r\nHe planted the Church anew in his remote little diocese. In vain did\r\nQueen Anne and Queen Caroline try to tempt him to leave the island by\r\nthe offer of another diocese. He set his face against pluralism, the\r\ncurse of his time, refusing to hold any preferments in addition to his\r\nSee, which was poor and impoverished. Crowds flocked to see him, to\r\ncrave from him a blessing. The writer has been with the fishermen of\r\nthis island, and heard them sing their sweet hymns as they kneel beside\r\ntheir bulwarks when they are going to ply their calling on the sea, and\r\nhe was told that Bishop Wilson first taught their fathers to sing those\r\nhymns and seek a blessing on their toil.\r\n\r\nWe know little of Dr. Hugh Bellot, Bishop of Bangor and Chester. He\r\nwas the son of Thomas Bellot, of Great Moulton Hall, in the parish of\r\nAstbury in this county, and died in 1596. Nor can I say much of Bishop\r\nRider, who was born in 1562 at Carrington in this county. He became\r\nBishop of Killaloe in 1612, and found time amid his episcopal duties\r\nto compile a Latin Dictionary. But every one has heard of the famous\r\nBishop Heber, who was born at Malpas in 1783, the son of the rector of\r\nthat place. His poems and hymns are known to all. It was his Newdigate\r\nPrize Poem at Oxford on the subject of Palestine that first brought him\r\nfame. For some years he was rector of Hodnet, where he delighted in the\r\ncalmness of village life. At length he received a call to the See of\r\nCalcutta, where he died at the early age of forty-three years.\r\n\r\nBishop Edward Stanley was the son of Sir J. T. Stanley of Alderley\r\nPark, and was born in 1779. He was rector of Alderley from 1805 to\r\n1837, and proved himself a model clergyman, shining as a light in a\r\ndark age. He came to an entirely neglected parish, and by his example\r\nand precept transformed it into a totally different place. He was an\r\nearly educationist, and took care that his children should be well\r\ntaught. He put down drunkenness and prize-fighting, and was a close\r\nobserver of nature--a northern White of Selborne. In 1837 he was called\r\nto the See of Norwich, which he held until his death in 1849--a very\r\nworthy Bishop.\r\n\r\nA few learned divines we may mention. Dr. Samuel Clarke, a Puritan,\r\nminister of Shotwick, where he was a favourite preacher. He was a very\r\nvoluminous writer, and died in 1682. Dr. John Hulse, the founder of the\r\nHulsean Lectures at Cambridge, was born at Middlewich in 1708. When a\r\nchild he was rescued by his grandfather from squalid circumstances,\r\nand obtained high university distinction at Cambridge. He became vicar\r\nof Goostrey until, on his father’s death, he became possessed of the\r\nfamily estate of Elworth, near Sandbach. John Barron, D.D., canon of\r\nSalisbury, chaplain to Lord Chancellor Egerton, and founder of a Hebrew\r\nlectureship at Brazenose College, Oxford, should be mentioned, who died\r\nin 1642. He is described by a contemporary biographer as “a bountiful\r\nhousekeeper, of a cheerful spirit and a peaceful disposition.” Many\r\nother names of learned bishops and divines will occur to the reader,\r\nand this list would include many of the bishops and deans of Chester,\r\nbut few of them were natives of the county, and are therefore not\r\nincluded in these biographical notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETS\r\n\r\nOf poets, we have mentioned the saintly Heber. But there are others of\r\nan earlier age. John Brownswerd, a native of the shire, was born in\r\n1540, and after graduating at Cambridge became master of the Grammar\r\nSchool at Macclesfield, earning fame as one of the best Latin poets of\r\nhis age. A tablet was raised to the memory of this “vir pius & doctus,”\r\nwho is described as\r\n\r\n    Alpha poetarum, coryphæus grammaticorum\r\n    Flos pædagogum hic sepelitur humo.\r\n\r\nHe died in 1589, a good example of the learned men of the Elizabethan\r\nage, who trained their pupils in good classic lore. There were several\r\nsuch schools in Cheshire--at Chester, Audlem, Northwich, and other\r\nplaces. Another Elizabethan poet owed his education to such schools.\r\nGeoffrey Whitney, who was born at Nantwich, learned his classics at\r\nAudlem and Northwich, graduated at Oxford, and then migrated to Leyden.\r\nThere he published his _Choice of Emblemes_, printed in 1586 in the\r\nfamous printing-press of Christopher Plantyn, and a collection of\r\nfables. Each poem is dedicated to one of the principal gentlemen in\r\nLancashire and Cheshire. The Cheshire historian Ormerod quotes a poem\r\naddressed “to my countremen of the Namptwicke in Cheshire,” relating\r\nto a fire that had lately destroyed the town, and comparing the place\r\nto a phœnix, of which the poet gives a device. Near Northwich was born\r\nSir John Birkenhead, poet and political writer, of humble origin, his\r\nfather being either a saddler or an innkeeper. The excellence of the\r\nCheshire schools is again shown by his ability in taking a degree at\r\nOxford and a fellowship at Oriel College. When the Civil War broke\r\nout he started the newspaper the _Mercurius Aulicus_ for the purpose\r\nof “communicating the intelligence and affairs of the Court of Oxon\r\nto the rest of the kingdom.” The King was pleased with this product\r\nof his fluent pen, and appointed him Reader in Moral Philosophy.\r\nWhen misfortune befell him with the fall of the Royal cause, he wrote\r\npoems and divers political tracts, and at the Restoration was rewarded\r\nfor his loyalty with a knighthood and other lucrative appointments.\r\nHe has been described as a man “of great courage in words, scoffing\r\nhumour, an unscrupulous conscience, and an inexhaustible fund of arch\r\nand mischievous drollery, ... one of the most expert and successful\r\nguerilla partisans on the side of the Royalists.”\r\n\r\nThe poet Milton is connected with this county, as his third wife,\r\nElizabeth Mynshal, a lady connected with some of the best Cheshire\r\nfamilies, came from Cheshire and died at Nantwich. She is believed to\r\nhave been a termagant, and brought the poet little pleasure, but others\r\nhave described her as of “a peaceful and agreeable humour.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. William Broome, a native of Cheshire, was a poet of some\r\ndistinction, a translator of Homer, and the coadjutor of Pope in the\r\ntranslation of the _Odyssey_. He supplied all the notes to that work,\r\nbut he quarrelled with Pope, and was lampooned in the _Dunciad_. Dr.\r\nJohnson gave him a niche in his _Lives of the Poets_, describing him\r\nas an excellent versifier; “his lines are smooth and sonorous, and his\r\ndiction is select and elegant.” Another name must be honoured among\r\nCheshire poets, that of Henry Birkenhead, M.D., a poet of distinction,\r\nFellow of All Souls College, Oxford, a founder in 1707 of the\r\nProfessorship of Poetry in that University.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGES AND CHANCELLORS\r\n\r\nSome Cheshire lawyers have achieved fame. In the spacious days of Queen\r\nElizabeth, at Nantwich in 1588 was born Randolph Crewe, who came of the\r\ndistinguished family of the Crewes of Crewe Hall, though his father\r\nwas in poor circumstances at the time of his birth. He and his brother\r\nThomas were fired with the idea of regaining the family estates. The\r\ngood schools of Cheshire enabled them to go to Oxford; they became\r\nstudents at Lincoln’s Inn, Serjeants-at-Law, and successively Speakers\r\nof the House of Commons. Randolph rose rapidly in his profession, and\r\nin 1624 became Lord Chief Justice of England. In the discharge of his\r\nhigh office he showed a perfectly honest and independent spirit, much\r\nlearning and ability, strict honour and integrity, therein differing\r\nfrom many of the venal judges of his age. He refused to bow to the\r\nKing’s will in respect of the imposition of illegal taxes, and in\r\nconsequence was deprived of his rank. He retired to his beloved\r\nCheshire, purchased the old family estates, and built for himself a\r\nnew manor house. Fuller tells in his quaint way that Sir Randolph\r\n“first brought the model of excellent building into these remote parts;\r\nyea, brought London into Cheshire, in the loftiness, sightliness, and\r\npleasantness of their structures.” His letter to the Duke of Buckingham\r\nis a model of straightforward honesty, stating his reasons for his\r\ndecision in the matter of the taxation, and asking for his Grace’s\r\nintercession with the King. While the war was raging between King and\r\nParliament he quietly passed away in his Hall at Crewe, and lies at\r\nrest in the Crewe Chapel at Barthomley.\r\n\r\nAnother eminent lawyer was Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, Thomas, Viscount\r\nBrackley, the natural son of Sir Richard Egerton of Ridley, born in\r\n1540. Queen Elizabeth on one occasion heard him pleading with his usual\r\nshrewdness against a Crown case, and exclaimed, “In my troth, he shall\r\nnever plead against me again,” and from that day his rise was rapid.\r\nHe became Attorney-General in 1592, was knighted, Master of the Rolls\r\nin 1594, and two years later Lord Keeper and Member of Privy Council.\r\nOn the death of the Queen he was called upon to conduct the affairs of\r\nthe nation until the arrival of King James of Scotland, who constituted\r\nhim Lord Chancellor and Baron Ellesmere. For twelve years he held the\r\nreins of office, conducted many important trials, helped to unite the\r\nkingdoms of England and Scotland, and at length, full of years and\r\nhonours, with much pathos resigned his high office, being succeeded by\r\nSir Francis Bacon. His body rests in Dodleston Church.\r\n\r\nThe name of Sir Edward Fitton, Lord President of Connaught and Thomond,\r\nand Treasurer of Ireland in the reign of Elizabeth, must not be\r\nforgotten or omitted from our list of Cheshire worthies. He was born at\r\nGawsworth, and a memorial to the knight may be seen in St. Patrick’s\r\nCathedral in Dublin.\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey Davenport was Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in the\r\nreign of Charles I., and had a distinguished legal career. He was the\r\nfourth son of William Davenport of Bramhall, near Stockport. Sir Peter\r\nWarburton of Grafton, one of the Judges of the King’s Bench about the\r\nsame period, was also a Cheshire man. Another great lawyer was Richard\r\nPeter Arden, Lord Alvanley, born at Bredbury in 1745. In 1780 he became\r\nKing’s Counsel, M.P. for Newton in the Isle of Wight, Master of the\r\nRolls, and, in 1801, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, when he was\r\ncreated Lord Alvanley, taking his title from a manor in the parish\r\nof Frodsham which had been held by his ancestors. He was a somewhat\r\noutspoken, hasty, and flippant judge, and amusing stories are told of\r\nhis sayings in court and of his disputes with Lord Chancellor Thurlow.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Williams was the son of a rector of Bunbury, where he was\r\nborn in 1777, and had a brilliant legal career. His reputation was made\r\nat the trial of Queen Caroline, whose junior counsel he was, with Mr.\r\nBrougham, afterwards Lord Brougham, as his senior. His able advocacy\r\nwas the chief cause of the vindication of the unfortunate Queen. He was\r\nreturned to Parliament for Lincoln in 1823, became Attorney-General in\r\n1830, and Puisne Judge of the King’s Bench four years later, when he\r\nwas made a knight. A volume of Greek epigrams testifies to his devotion\r\nto classical studies.\r\n\r\nThe last Cheshire lawyer on our list is Lord Kenyon. Though not\r\nactually born in the county, his native place being Greddington, just\r\nover the border in Flintshire, he had a Cheshire lady for his mother,\r\nand began his career at an attorney’s office in Nantwich. He might have\r\nspent his life there, having been offered a partnership; but he soared\r\nhigher, went to London, and was called to the Bar in 1756. He was M.P.\r\nfor Hindon and Chief Justice of Chester in 1780, and was engaged in the\r\ndefence of Lord George Gordon in that memorable trial of the Gordon\r\nrioters. After being Attorney-General and Master of the Rolls, he was\r\ncreated a baronet, raised to the peerage, and appointed Chief Justice\r\nin 1788. He was noted for his parsimonious ways, relics of his early\r\npoverty; but his biographers assert that few lawyers so able, and none\r\nmore honest, ever entered Westminster Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTISTS\r\n\r\nEdward Brerewood, the son of a Chester tradesman, born in 1565, was a\r\ncelebrated mathematician and antiquary. From the Free School at Chester\r\nhe went to Oxford, and became the first professor of astronomy in\r\nGresham College. Several of his works were published after his death by\r\nhis nephew, Robert Brerewood, of Chester.\r\n\r\nCheshire can boast of an early botanist and herbalist, John Gerarde,\r\nwho was born at Nantwich in 1545. He was head gardener to Lord Burghley\r\nfrom 1577. He took his early lessons in the book of nature when\r\nwandering on the banks of the Weaver in his native shire. He wrote, in\r\n1596, his work, entitled _Catalogus arborum, fruticum ac plantarum_,\r\nand he was the author of _The Herball or General Historie of Plantes_,\r\n“gathered by John Gerarde, of London, Master in Chirurgerie.”\r\n\r\nA more eminent scientist was Samuel Molyneux, son of a learned father,\r\nand was born at Chester in 1689. He was a wonderful, precocious\r\ngenius, and could do marvellous things when he was only five years\r\nold. His biographer tells us that “when he advanced to manhood he was\r\nacknowledged to be one of the most polite and accomplished gentlemen in\r\nEngland or Ireland, and was appointed secretary to the Prince of Wales,\r\nafterwards George II., and had a house in Kew, near Richmond, where he\r\nimproved himself in his favourite study astronomy.” He greatly improved\r\nthe making of telescopes. He married Elizabeth, sister to the Earl of\r\nEssex.\r\n\r\nThe third Lord Brereton, unlike his father, who loved warlike pursuits\r\nand fought for the King in the Civil War, was a lover of science and\r\npeaceful pursuits. He was educated at Breda in Holland, under the care\r\nof Dr. John Pell, and became a good mathematician and algebraist. He\r\nwas one of the founders of the Royal Society, associated with all the\r\nlearned men of his time, and always endeavoured to advance the cause\r\nof science. He was somewhat of a poet, musician, and composer. The\r\nproceedings of the Royal Society often record his name, which learned\r\nSociety in its infant days seems to have concerned itself with somewhat\r\nchildish questions, and exercised the minds of its members on the\r\ndivining-rod and the superstition with regard to the portents presaging\r\nthe death of any member of the Brereton family.\r\n\r\nLawrence Earnshaw was a wonderful mechanical genius, a native of\r\nMottram-in-Longdendale in the first half of the eighteenth century.\r\nNothing came amiss to his skilful fingers. He could shear sheep and\r\nmake the wool into cloth entirely with implements of his own making.\r\nEngraver, painter, gilder, glass-stainer, blacksmith, gunsmith,\r\nbell-founder; maker of sundials, harpsichords, violins, organs--he\r\ncould do everything. But his great achievement was in the art of\r\nclockmaking, producing a curious astronomical and geographical machine\r\nwhich represented the motions of the earth, moon, stars, &c. He\r\nanticipated the invention of the spinning-jenny, but destroyed his\r\nmachine lest it should decrease labour and take bread from the mouths\r\nof the poor. Another noted clockmaker was John Whitehurst, Fellow of\r\nthe Royal Society, born at Congleton in 1713. He was author of some\r\nphilosophical papers, amongst others of an _Inquiry into the Original\r\nState and Formation of the Earth_.\r\n\r\nAnother learned Cestrian was Dr. William Falconer, born at Chester\r\nin 1741. He was learned in science and horticulture, and published\r\nseveral works, including _An Historical View of the taste for Gardening\r\nand Laying-out Grounds among the Nations of Antiquity_; _An Essay on\r\nthe Means of Preserving the Health of those employed in Agricultural\r\nLabours_; and _A Sketch of the History of Sugar in Early Times_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORIANS\r\n\r\nMany are the writers on Cheshire history whose names should be\r\nrecorded--men who have loved their county and desired to tell of its\r\nbeauties and historical associations. We can only mention a tithe of\r\nthose worthy sons who have done honour to their shire, and accomplished\r\nwork which has been often little understood or appreciated by their\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is a name honoured by all historians, Henry\r\nBradshaw, a native of Chester and a monk of St. Werburgh’s Abbey, who\r\nlived in the latter part of the fourteenth century. He was one of the\r\nearliest chroniclers of Cheshire, and wrote his works in the cloistered\r\nshade of his monastic house. His works consist of a treatise, _De\r\nAntiquitate et Magnificentiâ Urbis Cestriæ_, and a translation of\r\n“The Holy Lyfe and History of Saint Werburge, very frutefull for all\r\nChristen people to rede.” The first work is believed to have been\r\nlost, unless it is incorporated in the latter treatise, as Dr. Gower\r\nsuggested. Perhaps we should have included Henry Bradshaw amongst our\r\npoets, in whose company he well deserves a high and important niche.\r\nHis body lies near the shrine of the saint of whose virtues he loved to\r\nsing.\r\n\r\nJohn Booth of Twamlowe, a contemporary of Sir William Brereton, was\r\na distinguished Cheshire genealogist who occupies a foremost place\r\namongst the antiquaries of the county. His works have been most useful\r\nto subsequent writers.\r\n\r\nJohn Speed, born at Farndon in 1552, is a writer of whom any county may\r\nbe proud. An account of this learned historian has already appeared in\r\nthis volume.\r\n\r\nThe disputes of the learned often cause amusement, and the controversy\r\nbetween the rival baronets, Sir Peter Leicester and Sir Thomas\r\nMaynwaring of Over Peover, aroused much merriment in 1673-75. Sir\r\nPeter published a learned work in two volumes on the historical\r\nantiquities of Great Britain and more particularly of Cheshire, in\r\nwhich he asserted that Amicia, daughter of Hugh Keveliock, fifth Earl\r\nof Chester, a descendant of Hugh Lupus, was illegitimate. This aroused\r\nSir Thomas Maynwaring, whose ancestor had married the said Amicia. He\r\npublished a defence of the injured lady. Then Peter wrote an answer to\r\nSir Thomas’s book, who retaliated with another book. So the controversy\r\nwent on, each disputant waxing more wroth, until at last a law-suit\r\nensued, the result being in favour of the champion of Amicia.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest historians of Cheshire was Daniel King, the\r\nauthor of _The Vale Royal of England, or History of Cheshire_. He was\r\nmore skilled in engraving than in writing, and his work was adorned\r\nwith plates by Hollar. He was greatly aided by William Smith, _Rouge\r\nDragon_, William Webb, clerk of the Mayor’s court at Chester, and\r\nWilliam Aldersey, Mayor of Chester. Webb had some pretensions to be\r\naccounted a poet, and wrote “a Discourse on English poetry” in 1586.\r\nKing’s _Vale Royal_ was not a great book, but it has served its purpose\r\nin preserving a record of many things which might have been forgotten,\r\nand its engravings and illustrations will always be valuable. An\r\nabridged and revised edition was subsequently published by Thomas\r\nHughes.\r\n\r\nAn account of the Randle Holmes--father, son, and grandson--a noted\r\nfamily of antiquaries, appears in another chapter. Mr. T. Worthington\r\nBarlow, F.L.S., barrister of Gray’s Inn, wrote much on the county; and\r\nwe are greatly indebted to his _Historical and Literary Associations of\r\nCheshire_ for much valuable information which has been useful in the\r\ncompiling of this record of Cheshire worthies. Nor must we forget the\r\ninteresting diary of the Rev. Edward Burghall, the Puritanical vicar of\r\nAston, who records with much perspicuity the events of the Civil War\r\nin Cheshire with many “moral reflections.” His animadversions on the\r\nQuakers, who troubled him sorely, are rather amusing reading.\r\n\r\nAmongst Cheshire worthies must not be forgotten Sir Richard Sutton,\r\nco-founder with Bishop William Smyth of Lincoln, of Brazenose College,\r\nOxford, “for the study of Philosophy and Sacred Theology, to the Praise\r\nand Honour of Almighty God,” in 1509. He was born at Prestbury, near\r\nMacclesfield, and was a lawyer, Governor of the Inner Temple, and\r\nSteward of the Monastery of Syon, afterward Sion College. He was the\r\nauthor of a work entitled _Orcharde of Syon_, but his chief fame rests\r\non his completion of the foundation of the Oxford College which had\r\nbeen commenced by the bishop.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are some of the worthies of Cheshire. Many others might be\r\nincluded, but the roll of honour of the county is already lengthy. We\r\nmight mention the names of several of the illustrious families of the\r\nshire whose scions still continue to follow in the footsteps of their\r\nforefathers, and have conferred credit on their houses and on their\r\nnative county. Some of the great and good men of Cheshire have but\r\nrecently passed away, whose names are household words in the Cestrian\r\nland. They need no mention, no memorial, save that which their lives\r\nand good deeds have afforded. The love of the men of Cheshire for their\r\nshire has inspired many an act of daring, much toil, much devotion; may\r\nit continue so to do in the Vale Royal of England.\r\n\r\nThere is one name more that must be mentioned. He has been denounced\r\nas a “viper of hell,” a “monster of men,” whose bones were dragged\r\nfrom his tomb in Westminster Abbey and buried beneath the Tyburn\r\ngallows tree. Shall a regicide be mentioned among the worthies? Such\r\nwas John Bradshaw, the judge of the Martyr King. He came of a good\r\nCheshire family, and spent his life in studying law, rising high in\r\nhis profession. This is not the place to judge his motives. He was\r\nno time-server, nor was he a universal favourite with his political\r\ncolleagues. It is enough for us to note that he was born in Cheshire. A\r\nfacsimile of the register of his baptism is shown with the additional\r\nword “traitor” added by a later hand, marking the writer’s detestation\r\nof the man who was called upon to play so prominent a part in the\r\ntragedy of the murder of a king, the chief instrument in the travesty\r\nof justice that ended on the scaffold at Whitehall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1602 December 1602 fol 98\r\n  John the Sonne of Henrye Bradshawe\r\n  of Marple was baptized the: 10^{th}\r\n                              traitor\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE FOUR RANDLE HOLMES OF CHESTER\r\n\r\n  (An Epitome of a Paper by the Late J. P. Earwaker, F.S.A.)\r\n\r\n  By the Archdeacon of Chester\r\n\r\n\r\nNo book dealing with memorials of old Cheshire would be complete which\r\ndid not give due prominence to those noted antiquaries of former\r\ngenerations, the Randle Holmes, and acknowledge gratefully and without\r\nstint the indebtedness of subsequent writers and students to their\r\nresearch and patient investigations. What follows will show, however\r\ninadequately, how great these obligations are. At the outset it may\r\nbe said that some confusion has arisen from the fact that the name\r\nRandle Holme was borne by four members of the family in successive\r\ngenerations, and as a consequence the work of one has sometimes been\r\nassigned to another.\r\n\r\nThe family of Holme is a distinctly Cheshire one, Robert de Holme\r\nacquiring by marriage at the end of the fourteenth century a moiety\r\nof the manor of Tranmere or Tranmole. The property remained in the\r\nfamily till the reign of James I., when William Holme of Chester,\r\non whom it had devolved, sold it. His uncle Thomas was the first to\r\nsettle in Chester, and his fourth son was the first Randle Holme.\r\nHe was born about 1571, dying in 1655, in the eighty-fourth year of\r\nhis age. By his marriage in 1598 with the widow of Thomas Chaloner\r\nof Chester, a distinguished antiquary and herald, he succeeded to\r\nher late husband’s papers, and was thus probably led to take up the\r\nstudy of genealogy and family history. Chaloner had held an official\r\nposition as deputy to the Heralds’ College, and in March 1600-1 he was\r\nsucceeded by Randle Holme, who was appointed by William Segar, Norroy\r\nKing-of-Arms, as his deputy, to keep a “regester booke of Funerals in\r\nthe counties of Chester, Lancaster, and North Wales.” In this capacity\r\nhe had to truly enter the arms and crests, &c., “of all such persons\r\nof Coate Armor and worship as it shall please God to call out of this\r\ntransitory life”; and to demand and collect the “due fees.” In 1604\r\nhe is mentioned as an Alderman of his company, as also is his brother\r\nWilliam, “a stationer,” he himself being “a painter.” In 1615 he was\r\none of the two sheriffs of the city, and in 1622 rebuilt his house in\r\nBridge Street, now the “Old King’s Head.” In 1631 he was one of those\r\nselected for “obligatory knighthood,” but he compounded by payment of\r\n£10. In 1633 he was elected Mayor of the city, and at the same time his\r\nson Randle became one of the sheriffs. He was in Chester throughout\r\nthe whole of the troublous time of the Civil War, and also during the\r\nviolent outbreak of the plague in 1647. In January 1646 he was charged\r\nby the Parliamentarians as having taken the King’s part, and was fined\r\nas a delinquent £160. This apparently he did not pay, for after his\r\ndeath his son protested against the payment of this large sum, and\r\nsome interesting documents are in existence in which it was urged that\r\nhe was looked upon as the Parliament’s friend. He died in January\r\n1654-55, and was buried at St. Mary’s-on-the-Hill, the interesting\r\nmemorial tablet on wood, bearing his arms, being unfortunately lost.\r\nHe was succeeded by his son Randle, born in 1601, who in 1625 had\r\nmarried the eldest daughter of Matthew Ellis of Overleigh, whose widow\r\nbecame ten years later his father’s second wife. In 1629 he was one\r\nof the churchwardens of St. Mary’s, holding office for two years; and\r\nin 1643 he became Mayor, and as such was the recipient of numerous\r\nofficial letters from the chief commanders of the Royalist side. These\r\nand other similar documents were bound up by his son and successor the\r\nthird Randle Holme, and are preserved in the Harleian MSS. in the\r\nBritish Museum. They bear autograph signatures of King Charles I.,\r\nPrince Rupert, Sir John Byron, Sir Francis Gamul, and many others,\r\nand form a most interesting collection. The same description applies\r\nto another volume, giving a full account of the siege of Chester, and\r\nwhich was written at the time and derived from papers of the Randle\r\nHolmes, the writer in one passage stating that he had “for the most\r\npart gathered this history from the study of Randle Holme”--that\r\nis, the second Randle Holme. This is a sufficient indication of the\r\nhistorical instinct and practice of the family, and of what we owe to\r\nit for the preservation of accurate records of events that happened.\r\nRandle Holme the Second did not long survive his father--only a little\r\nover four years. A handsome monument to his memory in the Church of St.\r\nMary-on-the-Hill in Chester gives a pedigree of the family, tracing it\r\nback to “Peter de Lymme, son of Gilbert, Lord of Lymme, who lived in\r\nthe time of Edward I.” It also contains three coats of arms, besides\r\ncrests, and is a good specimen of heraldic knowledge and genealogical\r\nresearch. This Randle Holme, though buried at St. Mary’s, lived after\r\nhis second marriage, in 1643, in the parish of Holy Trinity, where\r\nhis name appears in the list as Mayor in 1644. During the siege of\r\nChester the Stationers’ Company could not hold their meetings in the\r\n“Golden Phœnix” (the Phœnix Tower), and so they met at “Alderman Holmes\r\njunior’s house in Watergate Street.” In the entry of a meeting “at the\r\nAlderman’s howse” on October 18, 1645, we are told that “the Golden\r\nPhœnix was employed for service for the defence of the garrison of\r\nChester, the enimie in close seidge about the Cittye.” Whether Randle\r\nHolme the Second was able to secure the remission of the fine demanded\r\nof his father we cannot say. In the Harl. MSS. is a document in which\r\nhe has left a record of his family, with the dates of their births and\r\nbaptisms, and the names of their god-parents, designated in some of\r\nthe entries as “witnesses” and in some as “gossips.” We learn from\r\nthis that his first-born and eldest son, the third Randle Holme, was\r\nborn on December 24, 1627, and baptized on the 30th of the same month,\r\nand that one of his godfathers was Francis Gamul, the other being his\r\ngrandfather, the first Randle Holme.\r\n\r\nRandle Holme the Third is the most distinguished of the four who\r\nsuccessively bore that name. He was the author of a most extraordinary\r\nbook, entitled _The Academy of Armoury_; and he was also a prominent\r\nFreemason. He took up the business of his father and grandfather, and\r\nin due course was admitted a member of the same company, of which, on\r\nthe death of his father, he was duly elected an alderman. He served\r\nthe office of churchwarden of St. Mary’s for two years from Easter\r\n1657, and was instrumental in the erection of a new tower or steeple\r\nand the provision of a new peal of four bells, the initials of the\r\nchurchwardens (George Chamberlain and Randle Holme), as well as those\r\nof the bell founder, John Scott of Wigan, appearing on them. The peal\r\nhas now been enlarged into one of eight. In 1664 he was appointed to\r\nthe office of “sewer of the chamber in extraordinary to his Majesty\r\nKing Charles II.” A “sewer” was an officer whose function it was to\r\nplace the dishes on the table and to remove them afterwards, and some\r\nthink that it was also his duty to taste them. It almost looks as if\r\nthe title had arisen from the mis-spelling of the word, and as if the\r\n“se_w_er” really was the “se_rv_er.” However, the word is to be found\r\nin Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, and others. In the Harl. MSS. we have\r\nthe certificate of Randle Holme’s appointment, which shows that under\r\nit he was exempt from “bearing any publick office whatsoever.” This\r\nwill account for the fact that, unlike his father and grandfather, he\r\nnever held any office in the corporation of his native city. We do\r\nnot know by what Court influence he obtained this appointment, which,\r\nthough it contained certain privileges, must have been purely honorary,\r\nand we do not read of his being called upon on any occasion to fulfil\r\nits duties.\r\n\r\nA dispute arose about this time between Randle Holme and the Heralds’\r\nCollege, whose powers he was charged with usurping, by preparing\r\ncoats of arms and hatchments, and receiving fees for so doing. The\r\ncontroversy was sharp and took a very practical shape, for we learn\r\nfrom the diary of William Dugdale, Norroy King-of-Arms, that he\r\npulled down or defaced some “Achievements which Holmes, the Paynter,\r\nof Chester had hung up.” This he did at Budworth, Nether Peover,\r\nand Eastham, and other places in Cheshire. The dispute had nothing\r\nto do with his heraldic knowledge and skill, which cannot have been\r\ndisputed, but probably arose from the fact that he had not then (as\r\nhe subsequently was) been officially appointed deputy to the Norroy\r\nKing-of-Arms. It would have been a dangerous precedent to allow any\r\nunauthorised person, however competent, to undertake such functions,\r\nand might have led to much confusion and to many mistakes, so that\r\nthe action of the Norroy King-of-Arms is easily accounted for. The\r\ndifficulty, which lasted some five years or thereabouts, was apparently\r\nsolved by the appointment of Randle Holme as deputy to the Norroy\r\nKing-of-Arms (as his father had been before him), though there is\r\nno record of the date of his appointment. He had probably acted for\r\nhis father, and continued the same practice after his father’s death\r\nwithout waiting for the requisite authority.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1688 that he issued his extraordinary book--_The Academy\r\nof Armory, or a Storehouse of Armory and Blazon_. From the title it\r\nmight be supposed that the work was entirely on heraldic matters,\r\nwhereas it treats of almost every subject under the sun, and is a kind\r\nof encyclopædia, arranged, it must be confessed, in a most awkward\r\nform. He began collecting materials for it at a very early age, when\r\nhe was only twenty-two; and it was forty years later before the\r\nbook was printed. Whilst there can be no doubt that much of what it\r\ncontains might well have been omitted, it stands out as a monumental\r\nevidence of the industry of the author as a collector of out-of-the-way\r\ninformation which he was anxious to preserve, and of his desire to\r\nmake the work as complete as possible. The information thus gathered\r\ntogether is sometimes very valuable, and often very quaint; whilst\r\nspecimens of Cheshire dialect, now obsolete, are to be found in\r\nwords and phrases which were evidently in common use when the book\r\nwas written. The title-page, which is very long, prepares us for the\r\nvariety which the book contains, as the following sentence from it will\r\nshow: “Very useful for all gentlemen, scholars, Divines, and all such\r\nas desire any knowledge in arts and sciences.”\r\n\r\nThe chapters are dedicated to various personages or classes of persons,\r\nand some of these lengthy dedications are interesting compositions. The\r\nFourth Book was never set up in type, and of the latter portion of the\r\nThird Book the only printed example is in the Royal Library at Windsor\r\nCastle. Other copies end with the first part of Book III., concluding\r\nwith a valedictory address, explaining how the vast expense entailed\r\nand the inadequate return made him “resolve to go no further.” The book\r\nwas printed at Chester, and is the earliest work printed there, and as\r\nsuch has, of course, a special interest for the city and county. It\r\nis rather remarkable that on the site of his house in Bridge Street\r\n(engraved by Cuitt as _Lamb Row_, the house having subsequently been\r\nconverted into a hostelry, “The Lamb”) now stand the printing works of\r\nMr. Griffiths. In his will his son Randle referred to a “Room in his\r\ndwelling in the Bridge Street formerly made use of as a Printing House\r\nor place.” Dr. Ormerod describes the book as “the strangest jumble on\r\nnatural history, mineralogy, and surgery, occasionally diversified by\r\npalmistry, hunters’ terms, the cockpit laws, an essay on Time, and on\r\nMen punished in Hell.” The description is not inaccurate, yet there can\r\nbe no doubt that in its eleven hundred folio pages are to be found many\r\nvaluable pieces of information, and that in this respect they form “a\r\nstorehouse” not only of “Armory and Blazon,” but also of many other\r\nsubjects, so that the student who has the patience to explore them is\r\nsure to learn something. They show, too, what an inquiring mind the\r\nauthor must have had, and how he noted down and kept ready for use the\r\nknowledge he obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Lamb Row.]\r\n\r\nRandal Holme the Third was also a distinguished Freemason, and probably\r\none of the earliest connected with Chester. He alludes to the fact that\r\nhe was a “Member of the Society called Free-Masons” in his _Academy of\r\nArmory_, and one of his manuscript volumes is entitled _Constitutions\r\nof Masonry_, giving certain particulars as to the names of persons made\r\nFreemasons, and to the initiation fees paid by them. Evidently there\r\nwas a lodge of Freemasons at Chester in the seventeenth century, of\r\nwhich Randle Holme (III.) was a member. It has been supposed by some\r\nthat his father also may have been a Mason, as there are some masonic\r\nemblems on the monument put up to his memory in St. Mary’s Church.\r\nThe Freemasons of the county showed their respect for his memory, and\r\ncommemorated his connection with the church by rebuilding the north\r\nporch in 1892, whilst Mr. Henry Taylor, F.S.A., placed stained-glass\r\nwindows of a heraldic nature in the same, with a full account of him.\r\nThe laying of the foundation-stone of this porch by the then Provincial\r\nGrand Master, Earl Egerton of Tatton, with full masonic rites, was an\r\ninteresting ceremony, and was attended by some two hundred Masons in\r\ntheir regalia.\r\n\r\nIt has been already noted that Randle Holme III. lived in Bridge\r\nStreet. This house he apparently built about 1670, and did this without\r\nconsulting the Corporation, and he was ordered to pull it down, and\r\nfined for persisting in building it. The house, however, was not\r\ndemolished until early in the nineteenth century, when the Grosvenor\r\nBridge was built over the Dee, and it was subsequently converted into a\r\ntavern called “The Lamb.”\r\n\r\nRandle Holme III. died on March 12, 1699-1700, in the seventy-third\r\nyear of his age. He was thrice married, and had issue eight sons\r\nand six daughters. Of the former only three survived him--Randle,\r\nby his first wife, born in 1659, and George and John by his second.\r\nRandle was taken into partnership by his father when he was thirty-one\r\nyears of age--that is, in 1690. In 1691 he became a member of the\r\nStationers’ Company, of which he was elected an alderman in 1705,\r\nthe same year in which he was one of the two sheriffs of the city.\r\nLike his great-grandfather, grandfather, and father, he also served\r\nthe office of churchwarden of St. Mary’s, and like them, too, he\r\nwas deputy to Norroy King-of-Arms. He continued the work of his\r\nancestors, and the churchwardens’ accounts of St. Mary’s contain\r\nvarious entries of payments to him for work done. He died August 30,\r\n1707, aged 48, all his five children having predeceased him. In his\r\nwill, referred to above, he bequeaths all his books and collections\r\nof heraldry to his half-brothers George and John, to be equally\r\ndivided between them. These books and collections no doubt represented\r\nthe work and labours of all four Randle Holmes, as well as what the\r\nfirst of that name obtained by his marriage with the widow of Thomas\r\nChaloner. They represented the researches of over a hundred years,\r\nand contained abstracts of many documents which no longer exist, and\r\naccounts of visits paid to many churches, with accurate descriptions\r\nof the monumental inscriptions, and the old heraldic stained glass\r\nin the windows. Early in the eighteenth century they were purchased\r\nby Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, having been, it is said, first\r\noffered to the Corporation of Chester, who declined to buy them. They\r\nnow form a portion of that magnificent collection of manuscripts in\r\nthe British Museum known as “the Harleian MSS.,” and run to about\r\n270 volumes. Naturally their contents are extremely diversified, and\r\nthey vary considerably in value; but there can be no doubt that to\r\nany one inquiring into the history of Chester, Cheshire, Lancashire,\r\nand North Wales they contain a mine of information, and are simply\r\ninvaluable. Unfortunately there is no complete and sufficient index\r\nof their contents, so that laborious perusal of them is necessary, for\r\nthe acquisition of the information which they can convey. Allowance,\r\ntoo, will have to be made for the fact that none of the four were\r\ngood mediæval Latin scholars, for none of them had the advantage of a\r\nuniversity education. Consequently in their transcription of old Latin\r\nrecords many mistakes will be found, and though these may be irritating\r\nto the modern student, they can easily be corrected. The opinion\r\npassed on the first Randle Holme by the late Mr. W. H. Black, F.S.A.,\r\nAssistant Keeper of the Public Records, may virtually be applied to\r\nthem all: “In short, he was an industrious and faithful copyist or\r\ncollector of historical antiquities, but his philological learning\r\nwas too scanty for him to use extreme accuracy on the one hand, or to\r\ninvent any of the documents which he professed to transcribe, extract,\r\nor abridge on the other. Therefore his copies may be always relied on\r\nas faithfully transcribed in substance.” Though the man of learned\r\nleisure has not yet appeared who can wade through these volumes and\r\nmake us acquainted with the treasures they contain, yet it is true to\r\nsay that no historian of Chester or of Cheshire can fulfil his purpose\r\nwho does not either first-hand or second-hand (the former course being\r\nthe better) derive a great deal of information from these industrious\r\nantiquarians of the seventeenth century. They have set an example\r\nwhich has been stimulating and fruitful, and it is only right that in\r\na volume of this character generous and adequate expression should be\r\ngiven to the debt which we owe to them for the preservation of details\r\nand information which otherwise would have been irrevocably lost. They\r\nhave left also in many of the churches in Chester and its neighbourhood\r\nmany examples of their heraldic knowledge and skill in the memorials of\r\ndeceased persons. Painted as these were on wood, many have disappeared;\r\nthose that are still left are full of interest. May we not class these\r\nfour Randle Holmes as amongst Chester’s most notable worthies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE CHESTER MYSTERY PLAYS\r\n\r\n  By Joseph C. Bridge,\r\n  M.A., Mus. Doc. Oxon. et Dunelm., F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introduction._\r\n\r\nThere is no more interesting study in our early literature than the\r\nMystery Plays which were once so popular throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of England. It may be well to premise that their proper title\r\nis “Miracle” Plays, and no early writer ever alludes to them under\r\nany other name; nor was there in this country any difference between\r\n“Miracle” and “Mystery,” as stated by some authorities. But custom\r\nhas now definitely coupled the latter title with those early dramatic\r\nefforts of our forefathers, and it will be used in these pages.\r\n\r\nExcluding odd ones, four great series of plays have come down to us,\r\nviz. those of York, Wakefield, Chester, and Coventry, and each place\r\nprobably served as a centre of dramatic influence. While York acted as\r\na stimulus to Wakefield itself and Newcastle, so Chester supported the\r\ndramatic efforts from Kendal in the north to Shrewsbury in the south\r\nand Dublin in the west.\r\n\r\nEach series of plays possesses distinct characteristics, and, happily,\r\nChester can claim that her plays have in them “less to offend and a\r\nmore reverential tone” than many others, for it is useless to disguise\r\nthe fact that many readers object to these plays as seeming to treat\r\nreligious subjects with levity. But with a little reflection we shall\r\nsee that these plays do not deserve such condemnation if judged from\r\nthe right standpoint, and that standpoint is assuredly _not_ the\r\ntwentieth century. We must throw ourselves back five centuries at least\r\nif we are to obtain a right focus. From the time of St. Paul, God’s\r\nWord has been preached in divers ways and by divers methods, and we\r\nmust not be surprised if the mediæval preacher was shrewd enough to use\r\nthe dramatic instincts of the people as distributing media of religious\r\nknowledge.[6]\r\n\r\n [6] Milton thought of writing _Paradise Lost_ as a Mystery Play, but\r\n changed his mind.\r\n\r\nLet us remember that the Bible and religious books could not be read\r\nor consulted by the people; and as late as the seventeenth century we\r\nfind an aged rustic who knew nothing of our Saviour except what he had\r\nlearnt by seeing a _Corpus Christi_ play at Kendal, where “there was,”\r\nsaid he, “a man on a tree, and the blood ran down.”\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal of strong argument put into the mouths of mediæval\r\nplayers by the old Wycliffe preacher, who makes them say that “by such\r\nplaying of miracles men be converted to good living--and, since it is\r\nlawful to have the miracles of God painted, why is it not as lawful to\r\nhave the miracles of God played, since men may better read the will of\r\nGod and His marvellous works in the playing of them rather than in the\r\npainting of them ... for this is a dead book, the other a quick?”\r\n\r\nThe introduction of humour into these sacred plays is no novelty. There\r\nis a broad touch of it as early as the time of Hilarius in his play\r\nof _St. Nicholas_, and we cannot deny that the writers of our Miracle\r\nPlays showed some skill in thus early lighting upon one of the greatest\r\nof dramatic rules, viz. the law of contrast.\r\n\r\nThen, again, one other point, which is generally overlooked, must\r\nbe taken into consideration. The Persons of God and our Saviour are\r\ntreated with the _utmost_ reverence. It is only when the common people\r\ncome on the stage that we find a certain coarseness and humour. And\r\nthis is no more than we should expect to find.\r\n\r\nThese city actors would have thought it absurd to render shepherds as\r\nquiet, well-educated men. Did they not know plenty of shepherds round\r\nChester who had hard times and hard fare, and whose only knowledge was\r\nof the diseases of animals? Were they not plagued with mischievous\r\nshepherd-boys who were ever ready for fun and play? And if Noah’s wife\r\nwas a shrew, were they not well acquainted with many such, and was\r\nnot the scold’s bridle and the ducking-stool kept at the Cross for\r\nsuch offending citizens? And can we blame them for looking upon many\r\nof the characters mentioned in the Bible as being ordinary everyday\r\npersonages? I think not. However, opinions on this point will always\r\nbe divided, and the following quotations from the writings of two\r\nwell-educated women, who lived 100 years apart, are interesting:--\r\n\r\n “Next he (Mr. Bryant) spoke upon the Mysteries, or origin of our\r\n theatrical entertainments, and repeated the plan and conduct\r\n of several of these strange compositions, in particular one he\r\n remembered, which was called _Noah’s Ark_, and in which that patriarch\r\n and his sons, just previous to the Deluge, made it all their delight\r\n to speed themselves into the ark without Mrs. Noah, whom they wished\r\n to escape; but she surprised them just as they had embarked, and made\r\n so prodigious a racket against the door that, after a long and violent\r\n contention, she forced them to open it, and gained admission, having\r\n first contented them by being kept out till she was thoroughly wet to\r\n the skin.\r\n\r\n “These most eccentric and unaccountable dramas filled up chief of our\r\n conversation; and whether to consider them most with laughter, as\r\n ludicrous, or with horror, as blasphemous, remains a doubt I cannot\r\n well solve.”\r\n\r\nSo wrote that somewhat priggish but clever and witty young authoress,\r\nMiss Fanny Burney, in the eighteenth century.[7]\r\n\r\n [7] It may be interesting to note that her father, Dr. Burney, was\r\n educated in Chester.\r\n\r\nThe following twentieth-century opinion is from a paper by the late\r\nMrs. Henry Sandford, a woman of sound judgment and of great educational\r\nexperience:--\r\n\r\n “In the first place, we cannot but observe that, with all their\r\n faults, they did keep vividly before the mind of the English nation\r\n the leading outlines of Christian teaching, and that, in the\r\n historical form suggested by the Apostles’ Creed. Much that was\r\n legendary, coarse, incongruous, was there also, no doubt, but _that_\r\n was there above all.\r\n\r\n “The old religious drama created in the popular mind a high ideal of\r\n the true use and purpose of dramatic art, namely, to present to the\r\n imagination a living picture of the realities of life and feeling.”\r\n\r\nBut I will not pursue the arguments any further. Suffice it to say\r\nthat the sense of humour and the representation of everyday life occur\r\nin all the arts of the Middle Ages. Those who would eliminate all\r\nthis human part of the plays, or would forbid their use, must, to be\r\nconsistent, rip the _Misereres_ out of the choir of Chester Cathedral\r\nand burn them for firewood.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that not only was there irreverence, but even\r\nindecency, especially in the play of the _Creation and Fall_, where\r\nAdam and Eve are commanded to “stand nackede.” I believe this stage\r\ndirection to be merely figurative,[8] and the Cornish play of the\r\n_Creation of the World_[9] gives a clue to the whole matter, as it\r\ncontains specific instructions that Adam and Eve are to be “apparelled\r\nin white leather.”[10] At Norwich also we know that Adam wore “a wig,\r\ngloves, and a cote of hosen steyned,” and Eve “a wig, gloves, and two\r\ncotes of hosen steyned.”\r\n\r\n [8] Thomas Wright, the able editor of the Chester plays, comes, I am\r\n glad to say, to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\n [9] _The Creation of the World._ A Cornish Mystery, edited by Whitley\r\n Stokes.\r\n\r\n [10] The Person of God was also occasionally represented in white\r\n leather with the face gilded.\r\n\r\nFurther, there can be no doubt whatever that women were not allowed to\r\ntake part in plays or to appear on the stage in public until some years\r\nafter Mystery Plays had completely died out.[11]\r\n\r\n [11] Miss Hamilton Moore, in _English Miracle Plays and Moralities_,\r\n seems to think that I assert in my Introduction to the _Chester Plays_\r\n (published for the revival in 1906) that women acted the play of _The\r\n Assumption_. Not so: I merely stated that the ale-wives of the city\r\n provided and furnished the play, but I am quite sure they did not\r\n perform it.\r\n\r\nEvidence of this may also be found in the music of the plays. In the\r\nCoventry Mysteries the “Lullaby,” supposed to be sung by the women\r\nin the _Slaughter of the Innocents_, actually has _Tenor and Bass\r\nparts_.[12]\r\n\r\n [12] This trio would be sung by two men and a boy. Similarly the trio\r\n in Chester _Noah’s Play_ would be sung by the “Three clerkes from the\r\n Minster,” who, as we shall see, were duly engaged as professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Origin of Plays._\r\n\r\nThese plays sprang from the Church, and “all evidence points to Easter\r\nas the festival with which the earliest religious dramas were most\r\nintimately connected, and it is probable that the first form which the\r\nEaster play assumed was that of a ceremony in which the Crucifix was\r\nsolemnly buried on Good Friday and again disinterred on Easter Day amid\r\na pompous ritual.”[13]\r\n\r\n [13] Professor Pollard.\r\n\r\nSo long as the Church controlled the plays, the clergy were favourable\r\nto their performance; but when their popularity and their growth\r\nrendered it necessary to perform them out of doors, when the stage was\r\npitched on the green or in the street before the Abbey gate, it became\r\nanother matter.\r\n\r\nThe following rimes, written in 1303 by Robert Manning (Le Brunne),\r\nshow this distinctly:--\r\n\r\n    “Hyt ys forebode in the decree\r\n     Miracles for to make or se\r\n     For miracles yf you begynne\r\n     Hyt ys a gaderynt, a syghte of synne\r\n     He may in the churche, thurgh thys resun\r\n     Play the resurrecyon.\r\n\r\n     Yf thou do it in weyis or grenys\r\n     A syghte of synne truly hyt semys.”\r\n\r\nAs late as 1385 we find William of Wykeham objecting to the plays\r\ntaking place in the churchyard, and threatening those who should lend\r\nvestments from the church to the actors.[14]\r\n\r\n [14] We must not forget that the Welsh played interludes in their\r\n churchyards on Sunday afternoons down to a very late period.\r\n\r\nThe opposition of the clergy might have been fatal to the continuance\r\nof Miracle Plays but for the Feast of Corpus Christi, which was\r\ninstituted in 1264, and firmly established in 1311. On this day\r\nthe people and the trade gilds took part in processions with the\r\nclergy, carrying pictures and images of saints, and sometimes\r\naccompanied by the members of the gilds dressed as angels, the twelve\r\napostles, &c.[15] From this parade it was an easy step to dramatic\r\nrepresentation; and this day was rigidly adhered to by the gilds as\r\ntheir great and common festival.\r\n\r\n [15] This is frequently to be seen in Italy at the present day.\r\n\r\nChester has always had the credit of being an exception to the rule by\r\nholding the performances of the plays at Whitsuntide, but this view is\r\nincorrect, and Chester was, at first, in line with other places, for\r\nwe find from the Bakers’ Charter, 2 Edward IV. (which is the earliest\r\nauthoritative allusion to the plays), that “there hath been tyme out of\r\nmind a company of bakers,” and they are “to be redy to pay the costes\r\nand expenses and play and light of _Corpus Christi_ as oft tymes as it\r\nshall be assessed.”[16] Chester’s gilds were numerous and powerful, and\r\nmany of them exist in some form or other at the present day.\r\n\r\n [16] The alteration must have occurred very soon after this, for the\r\n “Banes,” quoted later, which gives Whitsuntide as the time of the\r\n plays, cannot, I think, be much later than 1470.\r\n\r\nThe authorship of the plays is generally attributed to Ralf Higden, the\r\nauthor of _Polychronicon_, and a monk of Chester, where he is said to\r\nhave died at a great age in 1353. But there is no evidence to justify\r\nsuch a definite statement as this. All we know of the origin of the\r\nplays is found in the following:--\r\n\r\n  1. A “Banes,” XV. Cent., giving Sir John Arneway as the “deviser.”\r\n      He was Mayor 1268-1276;\r\n\r\n  2. A Proclamation, _c._ 1520, giving Arneway as the “deviser,” and\r\n      Francis, a monk, as the writer.\r\n\r\n  3. A “Banes,” _c._ 1570, giving Arneway as “deviser,” and a “Dom\r\n      Randall” as the writer.\r\n\r\n  4. An account of the plays, by Archdeacon Rogers, _c._ 1575; one\r\n      version gives “Randall Higden” as the writer, and places the\r\n      time in the mayoralty of Arneway, 1328; the other version gives\r\n      “one Randoll a monke,” Arneway as Mayor, and the date 1339.\r\n\r\n  5. An endorsement or a Proclamation in the Harleian MSS., supposed\r\n      to be written by one of the Holmes, _c._ 1628, stating “Hignet”\r\n      was the writer.\r\n\r\n  6. A similar endorsement on a copy of the plays of about the same\r\n      date.\r\n\r\nIf the religious tendency of the Chester Plays was owing to a guiding\r\nhand from the monastery, that hand was, according to our earliest\r\ntradition, one Henry Francis, whose name occurs in deeds dated 1377-82.\r\nHigden was never mentioned until late in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that Henry Francis and Ralph Higden may have\r\ntranslated and revised some of the plays, and rendered literary help\r\nin reducing the cycle to unity, and that is all we can say with\r\nsafety.[17] And this theory is supported by the fact that the closer\r\nthe plays are studied, the more certain appears the fact that they are\r\nnot by one hand.\r\n\r\n [17] It seems to me sheer waste of time to try and synchronize Arneway\r\n and Higden as many writers do. I see no reason why we should not\r\n believe in the _earliest_ tradition that Arneway _devised the plays_.\r\n The writing of them would be a gradual process, covering many years and\r\n involving, probably, several authors.\r\n\r\nWright and Collier have pointed out many passages which are identical\r\nwith the French plays published in the _Mystère du Vieux Testament_.\r\nCertain plays may therefore have been translated from the French. The\r\n_Sacrifice of Isaac_ is probably derived from a play found at Broom\r\nHall, Suffolk, or perhaps _both_ are from some other original. Miss\r\nToulmin Smith says:--\r\n\r\n “Lines 163-314 have a strong resemblance to corresponding 134 lines\r\n in Chester version. This resemblance, sometimes of phrase, sometimes\r\n only of meaning, is interrupted by occasional passages in the Brome\r\n MS., which have no equivalents in Chester. Apparently, both editors\r\n worked upon a common original, but the Chester poet compressed the\r\n more freely, and, in so doing, greatly heightened the effect and\r\n dialogue. But he showed poor tact in omitting the charming scene\r\n between the father and the son after their agony is over.... It\r\n is possible, however, that the Chester play has come down to us\r\n mutilated. It was plainly at one time a separate play, and when\r\n amalgamated with that of _Abraham and Lot_ may well have been cut down\r\n for greater convenience of performance.”\r\n\r\nThe germ of the fine speech from the _Resurrection_, quoted later, may\r\nbe found in the Wakefield play, where it begins as follows:--\r\n\r\n    “Earthly man that I have wroght,\r\n     Wightly wake and slepe thou noght!\r\n     With bitter bayll I have thee boght\r\n         To make thee free;\r\n     Into this dongeon depe I soght,\r\n         And all for luf of thee.”\r\n\r\nThe _Three Kings_ seems founded on a Latin play, and the exceptional\r\nplays of the series (Nos. 23 and 24) can be traced in that fine old\r\npoem the _Cursor Mundi_.\r\n\r\nIn _The Shepherd’s Play_ we certainly find the work of a local\r\nplaywright, as references are made to a “jannock of Lancastershire,”\r\nbutter from Blacon (a suburb of Chester), and ale from Halton. Other\r\nexamples might be given.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that as the plays sprang from the Church, so the four\r\ngreat cycles now existing are derived from some greater and anterior\r\ncycle authorised by the Church.\r\n\r\nWe find numerous references in the Chester Companies’ accounts to the\r\noriginal book of the play, which is generally called the “reginall.”\r\n\r\nThis may in some cases refer merely to the special playbook belonging\r\nto the company, but it more often refers to the volume of the plays\r\npossessed by the City Corporation. If we still had this book we might\r\nsettle many vexed questions. Unfortunately it is missing, for on April\r\n30th, 1567, “Randall Trever gent was called before the Maior of the\r\nCitie of Chester and was demaunded for the originall booke of the\r\nWhydson Plaies of the said Citie who then and ther confessed that he\r\nhave had the same booke which book he deposeth upon the holy evangelist\r\nof God that by commaundement he delivered againe but where the same is\r\nnow or to whom he then delivered the same book, deposeth likewise he\r\nknoweth not.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1883, Mr. Sutton (the chief librarian of the Manchester\r\nFree Library) found an old parchment book-cover, with some writing upon\r\nit, which he submitted to Dr. F. J. Furnivall, who pronounced it to\r\nbe a portion of a late fifteenth century MS. of the Chester Plays. It\r\nis the commencement of the play of the _Resurrection_, and it is very\r\nprobable--being on parchment--that it is a remnant of the original\r\nChester Play Book.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore dependent upon certain transcriptions of the whole\r\nseries of plays made at the end of the sixteenth century. When the\r\nplays were dying out, it is certain that some of the old citizens would\r\ndesire to keep a “book of the words,” hence the number of MSS. of that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe Chester MSS. extant are:--\r\n\r\n  _a._ 1591,  by “Edward Gregorie a Scholar of Bunbury”;\r\n         now in possession of the Duke of Devonshire.\r\n  _b._ 1592 } by George Bellin, Brit.

It is no doubt the “riginall” which the\r\n Company used, as they were responsible for the play. I have collated it\r\n with the other MSS., but the differences are not very important.\r\n\r\nGeorge Bellin was parish clerk of Holy Trinity Church in Chester.[19]\r\nHe wrote an excellent hand, was a member of the Ironmongers’ Company,\r\nand had doubtless often acted in the plays, and he is therefore, on\r\nthe whole, a reliable guide, especially as to stage directions. He\r\nmade some curious mistakes, and his French is very bad, but we must be\r\ngrateful to him for his labours.\r\n\r\n [19] “George Bellin ironmonger & Clarke of this p’rish bur: in the\r\n middle Ile 23 July 1624.”--_Holy Trinity Registers._\r\n\r\nAs already stated, Chester was fortunate in possessing, like York,\r\nLondon, and other great centres, a powerful array of Trade Gilds.[20]\r\nThese City Companies provided workable units, and their power of\r\norganisation, the discipline exerted over their members, the brotherly\r\nfeeling engendered by the Companies were all potent factors in the\r\nrepresentation of these plays. “It made the performance a local work\r\nof art, in which all the city had a personal share. They believed with\r\njust pride that search England throughout none had the like, nor like\r\ndoes sett out.”\r\n\r\n [20] The City Gilds still hold an annual dinner in Chester, and in\r\n January 1908 representatives of some thirty Companies attended. Many\r\n of these Companies possess badges, flags, and documents of priceless\r\n interest; but in many cases they are insecurely kept.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the plays occupied many months. There was keen\r\ncompetition between the various City Companies, and great pains were\r\ntaken by the civic fathers to see that really competent players were\r\nchosen, and that no one should have an undue number of parts, and the\r\nMayor frequently attended rehearsals.\r\n\r\nThen the “Pageant carriages,”[21] which had been securely housed since\r\nthe last performance, had to be newly cleaned and repaired, and there\r\nneeded much mending and repainting of the canvas and boards which\r\nrepresented “Heaven and Hell,” “Morning and Night,” or, as in “Noah’s\r\nPlay,” was embellished with representations of birds, beasts, and\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\n [21] The carriages themselves were sometimes called “Pageants,” and\r\n were kept in special houses. Most of the Gilds had their own, but\r\n sometimes two Gilds shared the cost between them. They were drawn by\r\n men, as a rule, _e.g._:--\r\n\r\n    “To twelve porters of the cariage          ii_s._ iv_d._”\r\n                               --_Painters and Glaziers’ Accounts._\r\n\r\nThe stage manager’s properties had also to be bought or borrowed\r\nthroughout the town, and included many dozens of articles, ranging from\r\na costly cope[22] down to the whistles[23] for the shepherd-boys and\r\nthe ox tongue[24] for the old shepherd to put in his haversack, and\r\nit is obvious that the success of these plays depended greatly on the\r\nfelicitous subdivision of work amongst the numerous City Companies, for\r\nno one manager could have supervised the whole.\r\n\r\n [22]\r\n  “To the Clark for loan of a Cope an Altar Cloth and Tunick     x_d._”\r\n                                              --_Smiths’ Accounts._\r\n\r\n [23]\r\n  “For two Wystylls for Trowe                                   ii_d._\r\n\r\n [24]\r\n  “For a beast’s tongue and four calfe’s feet                 viii_d._”\r\n                               --_Painters and Glaziers’ Accounts._\r\n\r\nThe expenses were evenly divided among the members of the Company.\r\nSometimes there was a “passive resister” who thought the plays\r\nnonsense, and that there should be “no more cakes and ale”; but he was\r\nspeedily disillusioned, for the Mayor promptly clapped him into prison\r\nuntil he, or his friends, paid his proper[25] share.\r\n\r\n [25] Andrew Tailer of the Dyers’ Company was thus treated in 1575.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that “no English play that has been preserved to\r\nus contains any mark of its representation by clerical actors,” but\r\nwe find that as late as the sixteenth century the “clerks from the\r\nMinster,” the organist and choir boys, had no scruples about joining\r\nin the plays, and helping in those parts which required musical\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\n  1561.

It was probably due to\r\n his influence and co-operation that the Cathedral authorities joined in\r\n the preparation and plays, as appears from the Cathedral Treasurer’s\r\n accounts for 1567.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be the only time that they did so:--\r\n\r\n  “Item paid for a brode clothe againste\r\n    the Witson plais                                    vi_s._ viii_d._\r\n  Item for a barrell of bere to gene to the pleares\r\n    to make them to drinke                              vi_s._   --\r\n  Item for packe thread at Witson daye\r\n    to hange up the clothe                                --     ii_d._”\r\n\r\n  1568.

It is a curious document, for it is so\r\nextremely apologetic in tone, and notes even words in the plays which\r\nhad become obsolete. The “Banes” is dated 1600, and it is possible that\r\nBellin merely meant the date of his copying, but a careful study of it\r\nmakes me suspect that there was in this year one last expiring effort\r\nmade by the citizens to perform the plays, and that _this_ “Banes” was\r\nspecially written for the occasion. Although Archbishop Grindal had\r\nprohibited the plays in 1571, we know of performances up to 1576. In\r\n1599, also, Henry Hardware, the Mayor, “was not liked by the commons,”\r\nbecause he tried to do away with the Midsummer show and all festivity,\r\nbut we are expressly told that next year the Mayor, Robert Brerewode,\r\n“restored again all the ancient customs ... and put down Mr. Hardware,”\r\nand he may have tried to revive the plays as well as the Midsummer\r\nshow. However, no trace of any performance in 1600 has yet come to\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n [29]\r\n  “To our horses at the rydyng of the Banes                      xvi_d._\r\n  “To Richard Dobie for going on the stilts at the Banes ryding”   --\r\n                                    --_Painters and Glaziers’ Accounts._\r\n\r\nSome of the performers from the Mayor’s Midsummer show gradually got\r\ngrafted on to the “Banes Riding,” and increased the importance of it.\r\n\r\n [30] The Castle and the North Gate were two of the appointed places,\r\n and the “Banes” would be heard by the wretched prisoners there, to whom\r\n a donation was generally accorded:--\r\n\r\n  “To the prisoners at the Castle                                i_d._\r\n  To the prisoners at the North Gate

Banes we must notice first that it is in the same\r\nmetre and rhyming stanza as the Plays themselves, and may have been\r\nwritten with them. Secondly, it sheds light on some very important\r\npoints. Here is one:--\r\n\r\n    “The worshipfull wyves of this towne\r\n     Ffyne of our lady thassumpcon\r\n     It to bryng forth they be bowne\r\n     And meyntene with all theyre might.”[34]\r\n\r\n [34] It is worth noting, that in 1483, at York, four men came before\r\n the Mayor, “& by the assent of all the Innholders of this said\r\n Citie tuke upon them to bring furth yerely during the term of VIII.\r\n yere, then next folluying the pagent of the Coronacion of our Lady\r\n perteyning to the said Innholders, etc.” It seems likely, then, that\r\n the “worshipful wyves” were the ale-wives of Chester, and it is by no\r\n means improbable that Chester again followed the lead of York. As Mrs.\r\n Green says, “Cooks and brewers and hostellers were naturally deeply\r\n interested in the preservation of the good old customs, and it was,\r\n in some cases, certainly this class (the most powerful in a mediæval\r\n borough), who raised the protest against the indifference and neglect\r\n of the townspeople for public processions and merry-making, because\r\n ‘thereby the victuallers lose their money’; and who insisted on the\r\n revival of these festivals for the encouragement of trade.”--_Town Life\r\n XV. Century_, i. p. 153.\r\n\r\nHere we have _The Assumption_ definitely classed as one of the Chester\r\nseries (a point hitherto unknown), and also, we see that it was\r\nprovided by women; this is unique, I think. In none of the other cycle\r\ncentres do the women manage a play by themselves.[35]\r\n\r\n [35] Canon Morris says: “It is omitted from Bellin’s transcript in\r\n 1600, and was, in all probability, discontinued in Edward VI.’s reign,\r\n in deference to the religious feeling of the time.”\r\n\r\nAgain,\r\n\r\n    “Also maister maire of this Citie\r\n     Withall his bretheryn accordingly\r\n     A solempne procession ordent hath he\r\n     To be done to the best\r\n     Appon the day of Corpus Christi\r\n     The blessed sacrament caried shalbe\r\n     And a play sett forth by the clergye,\r\n     In honor of the fest.\r\n     Many torches there may you see\r\n     Marchaunts and craftys of this citie\r\n     By order passing in their degree\r\n     A goadly sight that day.\r\n     They come from Saynt Maries on the Hill\r\n     The Church of Saynt Johns untill\r\n     And there the sacrament leve they will\r\n     The sauth as I you say.”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Mayor and Corporation had ordered a procession\r\nat Corpus Christi, and that the clergy were to provide a play. What\r\nthis play was we have, unfortunately, no means of knowing.\r\n\r\nThis may account for the transference of the gild plays to Whitsun\r\nweek. The clergy, anxious to have the Corpus Christi procession to\r\n_themselves_ without the trade gilds, may have said to the citizens,\r\n“If you will have your plays at another time we will, at our own charge\r\nand expense, provide a play on Corpus Christi, so that there shall\r\nbe no loss to the citizens in that respect.”[36] Thus the plays got\r\ntransferred to Whitsuntide.\r\n\r\n [36] This is precisely what happened at York, where after 1426 the\r\n Corpus Christi procession and the plays were separated.\r\n\r\nMy third quotation must be:--\r\n\r\n    “Sir John Arnway was maire of this citie[37]\r\n     When these playes were begon truly\r\n     God graunt us merely\r\n     And see theym many a yere.”\r\n\r\n [37] Arneway was Mayor, 1268-76.\r\n\r\nThis is the earliest mention of their origin.\r\n\r\nAt last the momentous Monday in Whit-week arrived, and early in the\r\nmorning the first car started from the great gates of the Abbey, where\r\nthe Abbot and his followers sat in state, and proceeded down the street\r\nto the High Cross, where the Mayor and Corporation were assembled. As\r\neach car finished its play, its place was taken by another, and so\r\nin regular succession and at appointed places, the whole series of\r\nplays was gone through in three days. By this sensible and orderly\r\narrangement a citizen could retain his standing place or seat, and be\r\nassured of missing nothing. No doubt seats at the performing points\r\ncommanded a premium, and documents exist of an interesting law-suit\r\nbetween two citizens with reference to the right to occupy a “roome or\r\nplace for the Whytson plaies in the Bridge-gate streets in the Cyty of\r\nChester.”\r\n\r\nWe can imagine the pride of the Cestrian housewife when she saw her\r\nhusband magnificently dressed as “Herod,” or her sons in parti-coloured\r\ncostumes as “devils” rushing from the bottom to the top of the car only\r\nto disappear in “Hell’s mouth” amidst fire, smoke, and sulphur, and the\r\nlaughter and applause of her neighbours; and may not she have felt a\r\nholy thrill when, perhaps, her youngest boy on bended knee offered his\r\nsmall shepherd’s pipe or his nutting stick as a gift to the “Lord of\r\nall”?\r\n\r\nDepend upon it Chester was full of legitimate pride on such occasions,\r\nfor, as the citizens said in their Banes, “None had the like, nor the\r\nlike did sett out.”\r\n\r\nAnd the educational force of this cannot be overestimated. The young\r\ncitizen when he took up the freedomship of his company, took up also\r\nduties of stage craft and stage management which had been traditional\r\nfor generations in that company. If he possessed ability as an actor he\r\nhad no difficulty in obtaining a part to play, and if he could not act\r\nthen he found plenty to do in preparation for the play, which _esprit\r\nde corps_ demanded should not be behind other companies.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Elizabethan drama found a people already prepared, by\r\ncenturies of familiarity with the stage as an amusement, to respond to\r\nthe demands good plays might make on their imagination and receptive\r\nfaculties. The Mysteries were but young plants--Shakespeare was the\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the whole country was given up to plays of this sort, and\r\nwe know of more than one hundred towns and villages which enjoyed these\r\nentertainments. The annual play at Wymonham (or Windham), in Norfolk,\r\nlasted two days and two nights; and the inhabitants of Lydd, in Kent,\r\nwere so keen that they went to the play on a Sunday, while watchmen\r\nwere paid to keep guard on the shore against a surprise from the French.\r\n\r\nIf the trade gilds showed any desire to shirk such representations,\r\nthe Mayor could, and did, issue a notice commanding a performance; and\r\nit was also the Mayor’s duty, as officer of the King’s peace, to issue\r\nproclamations on all festive occasions of this sort.\r\n\r\nThe ordinances of the Mayor of York, in 1394 and subsequently, show\r\nthat the regulations to control the plays and populace were most\r\nstringent and comprehensive, and that the plays began as early as 4.30\r\nA.M.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the ordinary series of Chester Mystery Plays, we find\r\nthat the play of the _Assumption_ was performed at the High Cross in\r\n1488, and before Prince Arthur in 1497, both at the Abbey gates and at\r\nthe High Cross; and also in 1515 in St. John’s Churchyard. We find,\r\nalso, the Cappers, Pewterers, and Smiths undertaking plays in 1520-1;\r\nand that in 1529 _King Robert of Sicily_ had been performed at the High\r\nCross.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLAYS\r\n\r\nThe number of plays now existing is twenty-five, but we know that the\r\n_Assumption_ has been lost, and there are signs of two plays being\r\ncompressed into one, as in the _Histories of Lot and Abraham_, so that\r\nthe original number was no doubt larger. Fluctuations would undoubtedly\r\ntake place with the rise and fall of City Companies, if for no other\r\nreasons. As the number of gilds expanded or were reduced, so the plays\r\nwere increased or amalgamated.[38] The list of plays and the gilds\r\nthat performed them will be found in the “Banes” already printed. The\r\nChester series is noted for two plays that occur nowhere else, viz. No.\r\n23, on _Prophecies_, and No. 24, on _Anti-Christ_.\r\n\r\n [38] At York the MS. of the plays (_c._ 1430) shows 48; but in 1415\r\n there had been 51; and another earlier list shows 57.\r\n\r\nThe English employed seems to be of the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, many of the stage directions are in Latin, and the Three\r\nKings, Octavian, and Herod occasionally use French, that being the\r\nCourt language.[39]\r\n\r\n [39] It is not generally considered to afford any argument as to the\r\n plays being derived from the French.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that we have the text of the plays as written\r\n_at first_, for the original plays are without doubt much older than\r\nthe fifteenth century. We find that the quarrels of Noah and his wife\r\nformed so familiar a story that they became proverbial. Chaucer says:--\r\n\r\n    “Hast thou not heard (quod Nicholas) also\r\n     The sorowe of Noe with his felowship\r\n     Or that he might get his wife to ship.”\r\n\r\nChaucer wrote this about 1390, and it appears certain, therefore, that\r\nour play of _Noah_, and probably those on the same subject at Wakefield\r\nand Newcastle-on-Tyne, were often performed by the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe metre employed varies, but a large proportion is in eight line\r\nstanzas, sometimes with two rimes:--\r\n\r\n  a  a  a  b\r\n  a  a  a  b\r\n\r\nand sometimes with three;\r\n\r\n  a  a  a  b\r\n  c  c  c  b\r\n\r\nas may be seen in the following example:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRIST’S ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM\r\n\r\nTHE CORVYSORS PLAYE\r\n\r\n_Pagina decima Quarta, de Jesu intrante domum Simonis Leprosi, et de\r\naliis rebus._\r\n\r\n        JESUS.\r\n\r\n    Brethren, goe we to Bethanye,\r\n    To Lazarre, Martha, and Marye,\r\n    For I love moche their companye!         a a a b\r\n      Thedder nowe will I wende.\r\n    Symond the Leaper hath praied me\r\n    In his house to take charatye;           a a a b\r\n    With them nowe it liketh me\r\n      A whyle for to lende.\r\n\r\n        PETRUS.\r\n\r\n    Lorde, all readye shall we be\r\n    In life and death to goe with thee;\r\n    Greate joye they maye have to see        a a a b\r\n      Thy cominge into their place.\r\n\r\n        PHILIPPE.\r\n\r\n    Lazarre thou raysed through thy pittie,\r\n    And Symonde also, messille was he,\r\n    Thou clensed, Lorde, that wotten we,     a a a b\r\n      And holpe them through thy grace.\r\n\r\n        _Tunc ibunt versus domum Simonis Leprosi._\r\n\r\n        LAZARRUS.\r\n\r\n    Welckome, Lorde, sweete Jesu,\r\n    Blessed be the tyme that I thee knewe!\r\n    From death to liffe through thy vertue      a a a b\r\n      Thou raysed me not yore;\r\n    Fower dayes in eairth when I [had] layne,\r\n    Thou granteste me life againe.\r\n    Thee I honoure with all my mayne,      c c c b\r\n      Nowe and ever more.\r\n\r\nBut other metres are frequently used.\r\n\r\nA very fine dramatic effect is produced in some of the plays by the\r\nsudden use of the short Skeltonian metre. In the play of the _Passion_\r\nthe Tormentors cry:--\r\n\r\n    And thou be messye\r\n    And loth for to lye\r\n    Who smote thee? Crye\r\n      If thou be Christe.\r\n\r\n    Now he is bounden\r\n    Be he never so wounden\r\n    Soon he shall be founden\r\n      With flaps in fear.\r\n\r\n    In woe he is wounden\r\n    And his grain is grounden,\r\n    No lad unto London\r\n      Such law can him lere (teach).\r\n\r\nAgain in the _Crucifixion_:--\r\n\r\n        SECUNDUS JUDAEUS.\r\n\r\n    This coat shall be mine,\r\n    For it is good and fine\r\n    And seam is not therein\r\n      That I can see.\r\n\r\n        TERCIUS JUDAEUS.\r\n\r\n    Yea, God give me pain\r\n    And (if) that shall be thine,\r\n    For thou art ever incline\r\n      To draw towards thee.\r\n\r\n        QUARTUS JUDAEUS.\r\n\r\n    Nay, fellow, by this day\r\n    At the dice we will play,\r\n    And there we shall essay\r\n      That weed for to win.\r\n\r\n        SECUNDUS JUDAEUS.\r\n\r\n    His other clothes all\r\n    To us four can fall;\r\n    First part them I shall\r\n      And after play for this.\r\n\r\n    This kyrtel mine I call,\r\n    Take thou this pall,\r\n    Each man in this hall\r\n      Note I do not amiss.\r\n\r\nAgain, we get later rhythms grafted on to the original, as in the\r\ndrinking trio sung by Noah’s wife and her gossips in _Noah’s Play_.\r\n\r\nTHE GOOD GOSSIPS’ SONG.\r\n\r\n    The flood comes flitting in full fast,\r\n      On every side it spreads full far;\r\n    For fear of drowning I am aghast;\r\n      Then, good gossips, let us draw near.\r\n    And let us drink ere we depart,\r\n      For often times we have done so;\r\n    For at a draught thou drinkest a quart,\r\n      And so will _I_ do ere I go.\r\n\r\nThe “Song” concludes with what is probably a portion of the original\r\ntrio. The other half stanza is unfortunately lost:--\r\n\r\n    Here is a pottle good and strong,\r\n    It will rejoice both heart and tongue;\r\n    Though Noah thinks us never so long,\r\n      Here we will drink alike.[40]\r\n\r\n [40] With revised spelling the whole has a very modern “ring” about it.\r\n The first two verses may have been sung as a solo and the last half\r\n stanza as a trio.\r\n\r\nA similar instance is the Ale-wife’s speech, which has been tacked on\r\nto the end of the play The _Harrowing of Hell_.\r\n\r\nIn the _Resurrection_ play we have the following. It is one of the\r\nfinest speeches in the plays:--\r\n\r\n        JESUS.\r\n\r\n    Earthly man that I have wrought,\r\n      Awake out of thy sleep;\r\n    Earthly man that I have bought,\r\n      Of me thou hast no keep.\r\n    From heaven man’s soul I sought,\r\n      Into a dungeon deep,\r\n    My dear leman from thence I brought,\r\n      For ruth of her I weep.\r\n    I am very prince of peace,\r\n      And king of free mercy;\r\n    Who will of sinnès have release\r\n      On me they call and cry.\r\n    And if they will of sinnès cease,\r\n      I grant them peace truly,\r\n    And thereto a full rich messe\r\n      In bread my own body.\r\n    I am very bread of life;\r\n      From heaven I light and am sende,\r\n    Who eateth that bread, man or wife,\r\n      Shall live with me without end.\r\n    And that bread that I give you,\r\n      Your wicked life for to amend,\r\n    Becomes my flesh through your belief,\r\n      And doth release your sinful band.\r\n    And whosoever eateth that bread\r\n      In sin or wicked life,\r\n    He receiveth his own death,\r\n      I warn both man and wife.\r\n\r\nThree personages other than actors sometimes occupied the stage--a\r\nPreco or page, an expositor, and a messenger. They all three appear in\r\nthe play of _The Histories of Lot and Abraham_. The page appears on the\r\n“pageant carriage” immediately after the play of _Noah’s Flood_, and\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n    All lordings that be here present,\r\n    And hearken me with good intent,\r\n    How Noah away from us he went,\r\n      And all his company;\r\n    And Abraham, through God’s grace,\r\n    He is comen into this place,\r\n    And ye will give us room and space\r\n      To tell you of story.\r\n\r\n    This play, forsooth, begun shall be\r\n    In worship of the Trinity,\r\n    That you may all hear and see\r\n      That shall be done to-day;\r\n    My name is Gobbet-on-the-Green,\r\n    With you I may no longer bene;\r\n    Farewel, my lordes, bydene\r\n      For letting of your play.\r\n\r\nThe expositor or doctor takes care that the play is “understanded of\r\nthe people.” He appears early in the play on horseback, and says:--\r\n\r\n    Lordinges, what maye this signify\r\n    I will expound it appeartlye,\r\n    That the unlearned standing here by\r\n    May know what this may be.[41]\r\n\r\n [41] Being on horseback, he would, of course, be more easily heard\r\n by the crowd. Everything in the play points to the fact that it was\r\n looked upon as a means of instruction for the people, and not a mere\r\n amusement. The play itself consists of two plays compressed into one,\r\n and seems to be one of the oldest of the series.\r\n\r\nHe interrupts at different points, and explains the rite of\r\ncircumcision and the offering up of Isaac, and then we have the\r\nremarkable and significant fact that the crowd joins him in prayer.\r\n\r\n _Here, let the docter knele downe, and saie_,\r\n\r\n    Such obedience grante us, O Lorde!\r\n    Ever to thy moste holye worde,\r\n    That in the same we may accorde\r\n      As this Abraham was bayne;\r\n    Then al togaither shall we\r\n    That worthy kinge in heaven see,\r\n    And dwell with him in greate glorye,\r\n      For ever and ever, Amen.\r\n\r\nHis place is now filled by a messenger, who announces the next play.\r\nThe stage direction is--\r\n\r\n _Here the messenger maketh an ende._\r\n\r\n    Make rombe, lordinges, and give us waye,\r\n    And let Balacke come in and plaie,\r\n    And Balame that well can saie\r\n      To tell you of prophescie.\r\n    That Lord that died on Good Frydaie,\r\n    He save you all bouth nighte and daie!\r\n    Fare well, my lordinges; I goe my waie,\r\n      I may no longer abyde.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary reader has little or no idea of the literary and dramatic\r\nvalue of the plays, owing to the fact that printed copies are not\r\neasily accessible.\r\n\r\nI have thought it well, therefore, to print (in a slightly shortened\r\nform) and to explain the following play.\r\n\r\nIt embodies most of the points mentioned in this article, it has\r\ndistinct literary and artistic value, and, above all, the character of\r\nHerod made it the most popular play of the cycle, and is often alluded\r\nto.\r\n\r\nShakespeare uses the phrase “out-Heroding Herod.” Chaucer says of Joly\r\nAbsalon:--\r\n\r\n    Sometyme to shewe his lightness and maistrye\r\n    He pleyeth Herodes on a scaffold hye.\r\n\r\nIn the Paston letters we find Sir John Paston’s agent, in describing\r\nthe high-handed proceedings of the Duke of Norfolk in 1478, saying,\r\n“There was no man that played Herod in _Corpus Christi_ play better\r\nand more agreeable to his pageant than _he_ did.”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, I think, that the verdict of the general public was a\r\nsound and good one.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH PAGEANT--“THE THREE KINGS.”\r\n\r\n_Presented by the Vintners._\r\n\r\nThis must have been a striking sight, for the Three Kings, richly\r\napparelled, accompanied the pageant-carriage on horseback through the\r\ncity, and the First King tells how they are looking for the fulfilment\r\nof Balaam’s prophecy and seeking a sign.\r\n\r\n        FIRST KING.\r\n\r\n    Mighty God in majesty,\r\n    That ruleth the people of Judye,\r\n    When thou on man wilt have pity\r\n      And his sins for-bye,\r\n\r\n    Send some tokening, Lord, to me,\r\n    That ylke star that we may see\r\n    That Balaam said should rise and be\r\n      In his prophecy.\r\n\r\n    For well I wot, forsooth, I wis,\r\n    That his prophecy sooth is,\r\n    A star should rise betokening bliss\r\n      When God’s son is born.\r\n\r\n    Therefore, these lords and I in fere (company)\r\n    In this mount make our prayer\r\n    Devoutly once in the year,\r\n      For thereto we be sworn.\r\n\r\nThen they dismount, and the Third King hands his horse to attendants:--\r\n\r\n    “Say, fellows, take this courser\r\n    And abyde me right here,\r\n    Go we, sirs, to our prayer\r\n    I rede now in good faye;\r\n    I have done this many a year,\r\n    And my ancestors that before me were.\r\n    High God, prince of power,\r\n    Thou comfort us this day.”\r\n\r\nThen they proceed on to the pageant-carriage which represented the\r\n“mountain” they had to ascend. On reaching the top, an angel appears\r\ncarrying a star, and now the Kings burst forth into French:--\r\n\r\n        FIRST KING.\r\n\r\n    A, Sir Roy, si vous plaist\r\n    Gardez sus sur votre test.\r\n\r\n        SECOND KING.\r\n\r\n    Une Esteile issi est\r\n    Que sir, vous repleist.\r\n\r\n        THIRD KING.\r\n\r\n    A loys soyt luy une semblant\r\n    De une virgin portant\r\n    Comme le semble de une Infant\r\n    Embrace apportement.\r\n\r\nThen they fall on their knees, and the angel says:--\r\n\r\n    A! rise up, ye Kings three,\r\n    And come along after me\r\n    Unto the land of Judye\r\n    As fast as you may hie;\r\n    The child ye seek there shall ye see,\r\n    Borne all of a maiden free,\r\n    That King of heaven and earth shall be,\r\n    And all mankind for-bye.\r\n\r\nThen followed an incident which must have given great pleasure to the\r\nsightseers, for the Kings descended into the street[42] and mounted\r\nimitation dromedaries! The Second King says:--\r\n\r\n    Yea, sirs, I rede us every one\r\n    Dromodaryes to ride upon,\r\n    For swifter beasts be there none.\r\n    One I have, you shall see.\r\n\r\n [42] In the Coventry plays Herod “rages in the pagond and in the\r\n streete also.”\r\n\r\nTo which the Third King replies:--\r\n\r\n    A dromodary in good faye\r\n    Will go lightly on his way\r\n    A hundred miles upon a day,\r\n    Such coursers now take we.\r\n\r\nAnd then one MS. has the stage direction:--\r\n\r\n “_Then the Kinges go doune to the beasts and ride about._”[43]\r\n\r\n [43] Chester was accustomed to produce beasts of this sort. In 1564\r\n an agreement between the mayor and two citizens shows that the\r\n latter undertook to provide yearly for 40s. “4 gyants, 1 unikorne,\r\n 1 dromodarye, 1 Luce, 1 Camel, 1 Dragon,” &c. These were for the\r\n midsummer play. Each beast required two men to work it.\r\n\r\nAfter circling round the pageant-carriage they ascend it again, and\r\nthen, the star having disappeared, they are in doubt as to the right\r\nway, but fortunately meet with a messenger or “explorator.”\r\n\r\n        FIRST KING.\r\n\r\n    Can thou say ought what place and where\r\n    A child is born that crown shall bear\r\n    And of the Jews be king?\r\n\r\n        SECOND KING.\r\n\r\n    We saw a star shine verily\r\n    In the East in noble array,\r\n    Therefore we come now this way\r\n    To worship him with win.\r\n\r\n        MESSENGER.\r\n\r\n    Hold your peace, sir, I you pray\r\n    For if King Herod heard you so say\r\n    He would go mad, by my fay\r\n    And fly out of his skin.\r\n\r\n        THIRD KING.\r\n\r\n    And sith a king is so near\r\n    Go we to him in all manner.\r\n\r\n        MESSENGER.\r\n\r\n    You may well see he wounes here (lives here)\r\n    A palace in to dwell.\r\n    But moy he wot, withouten were,\r\n    That any is born of more power,\r\n    You bring yourselves in great danger\r\n    Such tydinges for to tell.\r\n\r\n“_Here the messenger goeth to the King and the mynstrilles must play_,”\r\nand the Kings are then introduced to Herod, and Court language again is\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n        FIRST KING.\r\n\r\n    Sir Roy, royale et reverent,\r\n    Dieu vous gardes Omnipotent.\r\n\r\n        HEROD.\r\n\r\n    Bien soies venues, rois gente;\r\n    Me dites toute votre intent.\r\n    (Welcome, stranger kings;\r\n    Tell me what is your intent.)\r\n\r\n        THIRD KING.\r\n\r\n    Infant, queruns de grand parent\r\n    Et roi de ciel et terre.\r\n    (Seeking a child of great parentage\r\n    And king of Heaven and Earth.)\r\n\r\nThen Herod bursts forth in the following fine ranting speech:[44]--\r\n\r\n [44] It compares very favourably with the “Coventry” play, where the\r\n ranting oversteps the mark and becomes balderdash.\r\n\r\n        HEROD.\r\n\r\n    Sirs, advise ye what you sayen;\r\n    Such tidings make my heart unfayne;\r\n    I rede you take these words again,\r\n      For fear of villany.\r\n\r\n    There is none so great that me dare gain\r\n    To take my realm, and to attain\r\n    My power, but he shall have pain\r\n      And be punished apertly.\r\n\r\n    I, king of kings, none so keen;\r\n    I, soveraign sire, as well is seen;\r\n    I, tyrant, that may both take and teen\r\n      Castle, tower, and towne,\r\n\r\n    I wield this world withouten wene,\r\n    I beat all those unbuxsome beene,\r\n    I drive the devils all by deene\r\n      Deep in hell adowne.\r\n\r\n    For I am king of all mankind;\r\n    I bid--I beat--I loose--I bind,\r\n    I master the moon: Take this in mind\r\n      That I am most of might.\r\n\r\n    I am the greatest above degree\r\n    That is, or was, or ever shall be.\r\n    The sun it dare not shine on me\r\n    If I bid him go down.\r\n\r\n    No rain to fall shall none be free\r\n    Nor no Lord have that liberty\r\n    That dare abide, and I bid flee,\r\n    But I shall crack his crown.\r\n\r\n    Nor far nor near that doth me (an)noy\r\n    Who wrathes me, I shall destroy;\r\n    For every freak I dare defie\r\n    That nill me pay ne please.\r\n\r\n    But you be bayne, I shall you beat,\r\n    There is no man for you shall treat;\r\n    [_Then aside_] All for wrath see how I sweat;\r\n    My heart is not at ease.\r\n\r\nAnd to carry out his pretence that he is not frightened but quite cool,\r\nhe throws his sword up in the air and dexterously catches it while he\r\ncontinues:--\r\n\r\n    For all men may witte and see,\r\n    Both he and you all three,\r\n    That I am King of Galilee\r\n    Whatsoever he saith or does.\r\n    What the devil should this be!\r\n    A boy--a groom of low degree\r\n    Should reign above my Royalty\r\n      And make me but a goose!\r\n\r\nThe Kings then answer:--\r\n\r\n    By prophecy well wotten we\r\n    That a childe born should be\r\n    To rule the people of Judye\r\n      As was said many a year.\r\n\r\nHerod says:--\r\n\r\n    Other kings shall none here be\r\n    .      .      .      .      .\r\n    But seeing you speak of prophecy\r\n    Whether ye speak sooth or lye\r\n      My clarke soon shall see.\r\n\r\nHe then bids his “chief of clergy” to look up the books of prophecy and\r\ntell him what they say.\r\n\r\nThen the doctor reads the scriptures, and amongst other prophecies\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n        DOCTOR.\r\n\r\n    Daniel, fulfilled with heavenly grace,\r\n    Prophesied also by divine inspiration,\r\n    That when he was came, that all holy was,\r\n    The most holiest in earth, to take his habitation\r\n    In the womb of a virgin, and by his blessed incarnation\r\n    Out of Satan’s band to deliver mankind,\r\n    Whom sin original piteously did bind,\r\n    Then both unctions, sacrifices and rites ceremonial\r\n    Of the Old Testament with legal observation,\r\n    Shall utterly cease and take their end final,\r\n    Through Christ’s coming which for man’s salvation\r\n    A New Testament shall ordain by divine operation\r\n    Offering himself in Sacrifice for mankind’s offence,\r\n    Which from Heaven was exiled through his great negligence.\r\n\r\n        HEROD.\r\n\r\n    Fie on that dream, reader! such dotards never shall\r\n    Nor no sleeping sluggard make my right title cease\r\n    But I shall knightly keep it, whatsoever befall,\r\n    Against that young godling, and if he once do press\r\n    This kingdom to claim, or put me to distress\r\n    His head off shall I hew....\r\n                    Yet look if thou find there\r\n    Where this boy is born for whom these kings enquire.\r\n\r\n        DOCTOR.\r\n\r\n    Micheias, enflamed with ghostly inspiration,\r\n    Prophesied that Bethlehem should a prince forth bring\r\n    Ruler of God’s people and of the Jew’s nation\r\n    Should he be born of Israel to be king.\r\n\r\n        .      .      .      .      .\r\n\r\n    Esay, unto whom the spirit of prophecy\r\n    Was singularly given through the Holy Ghost\r\n    In this time prophesied that kings witterly,\r\n    And folk of strange nations from many a sundry coast,\r\n    That prince’s birth to magnify which of might is most\r\n    Should walk in great light, and brightness should appear\r\n    As did unto these kings in a bright star shining clear.\r\n\r\n        HEROD (_throwing his sword down_).\r\n\r\n    Alas, what presumption should move that peevish page\r\n    Or any elfish godling to take from me my crown?\r\n    But by Mahomet! that boy for all his great outrage\r\n    Shall die under my hand, that elfe and vile congeon!\r\n    And all his partakers I shall slay and beat down,\r\n    And both of him and his final destruction make\r\n    Such vengeance, and such cruelty on them all will I take,\r\n    That none such a slaughter was seen or heard beforne\r\n    Sith Athalia here reigned....\r\n                    Yet look and search again\r\n    If these kings shall find him and his presence attain.\r\n\r\n        DOCTOR.\r\n\r\n    David of all prophets called most prepotent\r\n    Prophesied that kings from Tharsis and Araby\r\n    With mystical gifts shall come and present\r\n    That lord, that king, and high Messie (Messiah),\r\n    That in Bethlehem shall be borne,\r\n    A child to save that was forlorne,\r\n    And rule all Israel.\r\n\r\n        HEROD (_breaking his sword in his rage_).\r\n\r\n    By Mahoun! thou art foresworn.\r\n    Have done; these books were best rent and torn.\r\n                                        [_Throws the book on the floor._\r\n    For he shall be no king in crown\r\n    But I fully in my weal.\r\n    And mauger David, that shepherd with his sling\r\n    Esay, Jeremy with all their offspring\r\n    Here get no other Messiah nor king\r\n    From my right title to expel,\r\n        .      .      .      .      .\r\n    This realm is mine and shall be aye\r\n    Manfully to maintain it while I may.\r\n    Tho’ he bring with him to-day\r\n    The devil and all his host.\r\n\r\nThen, concealing his anger, he turns to the Kings and suavely says:--\r\n\r\n    But go ye forth ye kings three\r\n    And enquire if it so be\r\n    But always come again to me,\r\n    For you I think to feed.\r\n    And if he be of such degree\r\n    Him will I honour as do ye,\r\n    As falls for his dignity,\r\n    In word, thought and deed.\r\n\r\n        FIRST KING.\r\n\r\n    By leave, sir, and have good day\r\n    Till we come again this way.\r\n\r\n        SECOND KING.\r\n\r\n    Sir, as soon as ever we may\r\n    And as we see so shall we say.\r\n\r\n        THIRD KING.\r\n\r\n    And of his riches and his array\r\n    From you we shall not leave.\r\n\r\n        HEROD.\r\n\r\n    Farewell Lords, in good faye\r\n    But hye you fast again.\r\n\r\nImmediately the Kings retire, Herod breaks forth again:--\r\n\r\n    Out alas! what the devil is this?\r\n    For shame almost I fare amiss\r\n    For was I never so cool, I wyss\r\n    For wrath I am near woode (mad)!\r\n    For every man may well say this\r\n    That I maintain my realm amiss\r\n    To let a boy inherit my bliss\r\n      That never was of my blood.\r\n\r\nBut to-morrow he will--\r\n\r\n    Raise the country on every side,\r\n    All that may ever go or ride;\r\n    So shall this boy lose his pride\r\n      For all his greatest boast.\r\n\r\nNow he can do no more, and he sinks back, exhausted, into a chair:--\r\n\r\n    This boast doth me so great annoy\r\n    That I wax dull and clean dry.\r\n    Have done!--and fill the wine in high,\r\n    I die but I have drink.\r\n    Fill fast and let the cups fly\r\n    And go we hither hastily;\r\n    For I must ordain curiously\r\n    Against these Kings coming.\r\n\r\nSuch is the play of _The Three Kings_, and there can be no doubt\r\nwhatever of its fine dramatic effect. We cannot wonder that this\r\ncharacter of Herod is mentioned by old writers more than other\r\ncharacters of the plays. Imperious and proud, firmly believing in his\r\nown kingly right, but, like most ignorant people, profoundly impressed\r\nby prophecies and vaticinations which he did not understand, Herod is\r\nnow impelled forward by swaggering pride and now dragged back by craven\r\nfear and subtle influences.\r\n\r\nThe part gives the actor every opportunity to show forth his art, and\r\nthe calm, clear tones of the doctor quietly reading the scriptures give\r\nthe required dramatic contrast. The speeches show the traces of late\r\nliterary labour, and that we had got within measurable distance of\r\nblank verse when the play received its last polish, though the original\r\nplay was probably founded on an early Latin one called _Herodes, sive\r\nmagorum adoratio_.[45]\r\n\r\n    “Postea Herodes interroget Scribas, dicens:\r\n            O vos scribae\r\n            Interrogati dicite\r\n            Si quid de hoc puero\r\n            Scriptum videritis in libro.\r\n\r\n Tunc Scribae diu revolvant librum, et tandem inventa quasi prophetica\r\n dicant....\r\n\r\n    Vidimus, Domine, in prophetarum\r\n            Lineis, nasci Christum\r\n            In Bethleem Iudae civitate\r\n            David propheta sic vaticinante.\r\n\r\n Tunc Herodes, visa prophetica, furore accensus, _projiciat librum_,”\r\n &c.\r\n\r\n [45] See Wright’s _Early Mysteries_, p. 26.\r\n\r\nThis play, together with the play of _The Salutation and the Nativity_\r\nand _The Shepherds’ Play_, was acted at Chester in 1906 by Mr. Nugent\r\nMonck and his “English Drama Company” under the auspices of the Chester\r\nand North Wales Archæological Society, and with success, but the\r\nexpense was too great to admit of the whole cycle being performed. The\r\nsame plays have also been performed in London by Mr. Monck’s company,\r\nand by Mr. Benson’s company at Stratford-on-Avon during the Shakespeare\r\nCommemoration week.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would point out that the motto of the city of Chester\r\nis curious and indeed unique:--\r\n\r\n  “Antiqui colant Antiquum Dierum.”\r\n\r\n  “_Let the ancient people worship the Ancient of Days._”\r\n\r\nI cannot help thinking that this contains an occult reference to the\r\nChester Mystery Plays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SIEGE OF CHESTER\r\n\r\n  By the Archdeacon of Chester[46]\r\n\r\n [46] The writer has got most of the information in this paper from _The\r\n History of the Siege of Chester_, published by Broster in 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Chester, with its ancient walls and ramparts, erected as\r\nthey were for the protection of the inhabitants, must have experienced\r\nmany an onslaught, and again and again its citizens must have known\r\nwhat it was to be besieged for a shorter or a longer period. But _the_\r\nSiege of Chester--the one, that is, which stands out in history so that\r\nit deserves this definite title--is the one that occurred in the time\r\nof the Civil War, and which lasted practically for three years, and for\r\none year at least was very close.\r\n\r\nBishop Creighton has told us that “the Civil War wrought greater havoc\r\nin Cheshire than in any other part of the country”; and the city of\r\nChester suffered, we may say, more severely than any other place in\r\nthe county. The city, as Lord Clarendon tells us, “was firm to the\r\nKing, by the virtue of its inhabitants.” Not that quite all were of\r\nthe same mind, for on August 8, 1642, a determined attempt was made\r\nto rouse the disaffected within the city and induce them to enlist\r\nthemselves on the side of the Parliament. The vigorous action of the\r\nMayor, Thomas Cowper, repressed the movement, and, in fact, gave rise\r\nto a vigorous counter-movement and to the raising and equipment of\r\n300 men in the following October in addition to the ordinary _trained\r\nband_. A regular and continuous watch was appointed for each of the\r\nfour city gates, and a levy or assessment made for its maintenance. A\r\nlittle more than three months later, on February 3, 1643, a further\r\nassessment of £500 was made and forthwith collected for the making of\r\nfortifications, and for defraying divers charges incident thereunto.\r\nWhen these loyal proceedings were reported to his Majesty, he thought\r\nit necessary to send to his faithful citizens at Chester an officer\r\nof skill and experience to direct their courage, and appointed Sir\r\nNicholas Byron, a soldier of very good command, as Colonel General of\r\nCheshire and Shropshire and Governor of Chester. He inspired great\r\nenthusiasm, and was able, with the encouragement of some gentlemen\r\nin North Wales, to raise a considerable body of horse and foot. He\r\nalso directed the operations with such vigour that the outworks and\r\nentrenchments were completed in the summer, giving a further protection\r\noutside the walls from Pemberton’s Parlour right round to the river.\r\nMeanwhile Sir William Brereton, a gentleman of competent fortune in the\r\ncounty, had taken command of the Parliamentary forces, and established\r\nhimself at Nantwich, which he fortified. From that place he made an\r\nattack upon Chester on July 20th, but was driven back with some loss,\r\nand proceeded to Flint, joining in the siege of that castle till its\r\nsurrender upon honourable terms, owing to lack of provisions, was\r\neffected. Whilst this siege was proceeding the houses and buildings\r\njust outside the entrenchments were cleared away. The King thought it\r\ndesirable to visit Chester in person; the city being of the greatest\r\nimportance as the key to Ireland. Accordingly he despatched a courier\r\nfrom Stafford on September 18, 1643, and announced his intention;\r\nand five days later, attended by many of the nobility and gentry,\r\napproached the city and was received by the civic authorities and the\r\ncitizens with all loyal devotion. The Mayor delivered the city sword\r\nto the King, who graciously returned it, when the Mayor, bare-headed,\r\ncarried it before his Majesty to the Pentice, where the King was\r\nentertained and presented with £200 in gold, and £100 was given to\r\nthe Prince of Wales. The King’s stay in the city was very brief, and\r\nafter a few days he departed, having heard from Prince Rupert of the\r\nadvantage gained by his forces before Worcester. Shortly afterwards\r\nSir William Brereton occupied Hawarden Castle, and from there demanded\r\nthe surrender of the city of Chester. As a matter of precaution the\r\nhouses in the intervening suburb of Handbridge and the neighbourhood\r\nwere destroyed by the authorities of Chester; and eventually Hawarden\r\nCastle, which had been invested by the King’s forces from Ireland,\r\naided by reinforcements from Chester, capitulated on honourable terms.\r\nMeanwhile Beeston Castle, on a commanding position a few miles from the\r\ncity, had been occupied by the Parliamentarians; but on December 13,\r\n1643, it fell into the hands of the Royalists, who were led by Captain\r\nThomas Sandford, “Captain of Firelocks.” A few weeks later the head of\r\nthe surrendered garrison, Captain Steel, was condemned at Nantwich by\r\nhis own party and shot as a traitor.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that the citizens had to put forth\r\nsupreme efforts to maintain their troops and defend their position.\r\nAccordingly we find various resolutions passed at their assemblies\r\nwith these objects in view. At one of them the Mayor was desired to\r\nrepair with all speed to Oxford to present a petition to his Majesty\r\nin answer to a gracious letter received by him. Payments were ordered\r\nand levies made for the reparation of the mud walls as outworks, and\r\nfor the repair of the city walls and cleaning out of the city ditch,\r\n&c. In January 1644 one hundred pounds’ worth of the city plate was\r\nconverted into coin to be used for the defence of the city, whilst a\r\nfurther assessment was levied for the perfecting of the works, and for\r\nprovisioning the garrison. It was also ordered that £300 should be\r\npresented to the King and a like amount to the Prince of Wales. Lord\r\nByron, nephew of the governor, was in command of the Royalist forces;\r\nand although he had gained a signal victory near Middlewich in December\r\n1643, he failed a month later in his siege of Nantwich, and had to\r\nmake good his retreat to Chester. Early in 1644 the Parliamentarians\r\nadvanced close to the city and effected a lodgment at Christleton. They\r\nwere forced to retire; but to prevent danger in the future the suburb\r\nof Great Boughton was burnt down by the citizens, so that the enemy\r\nmight not harbour there.\r\n\r\nIn March 1644, Prince Maurice arrived in the city, and a form of loyal\r\nprotestation was drawn up, which was to be submitted “to all the\r\nnobility, gentry, divines, citizens, and all other inhabitants of the\r\ncity.” In the summer and autumn of this year the city was more closely\r\nsurrounded by troops under the command first of Colonel Jones and\r\nsubsequently of Sir William Brereton himself. Various communications\r\npassed between the besiegers and the besieged, in which the former were\r\nurged to submit, a course they strenuously refused to adopt. They were,\r\nhowever, in a very confused situation, having nothing but the city wall\r\nfor their defence. The frequent assessments which had become necessary\r\nalso caused a good deal of discontent, and it was found expedient to\r\nnominate a number of soldiers to collect them. On November 18th, Sir\r\nWilliam Brereton demanded the surrender of the city “by trumpet,” and\r\nto this, after a second letter on the following day, an indignant\r\nrefusal was rendered. The confusion occasioned by the war led to no\r\nMayor being elected this year. A “faithful well-wisher,” by a letter\r\ntied to an arrow and shot into the city, endeavoured by insinuating\r\nmethods to induce the citizens to betray their trust, but without\r\nsuccess; though the constant levying of assessments showed strongly\r\nthe state to which the garrison must have been reduced, and the heavy\r\ndemands which were made on the loyalty and patriotism of the besieged.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1645, the correspondence between the leaders on\r\nboth sides was constant. Sir William Brereton, however, seems to have\r\nbeen indisposed to treat with commissioners from the other side for a\r\nsurrender, which apparently he would only accept on his own terms,\r\nwhich were set forth in a letter thrown over the walls. In March the\r\nadvent of Prince Maurice and Prince Rupert into Cheshire caused some\r\ndiversion of the besieging forces; and in May Sir William Brereton\r\nretreated from his position before Chester to Nantwich, and on the 22nd\r\nthe city was relieved. This movement was no doubt due to the report\r\nthat the King himself was advancing with a powerful army. He did not,\r\nhowever, at that time come further than Drayton, from which place he\r\nmarched to Uttoxeter. The city, however, was not left without anxiety,\r\nas the outworks may be said to have been still in the possession of the\r\nenemy. In September intelligence was received that the King had left\r\nHereford with his forces, and was on his way to Chester. Coming from\r\nChirk Castle, he sent most of his horse over Holt or Farndon Bridge\r\ninto Cheshire, and himself, with his guards and Lord Gerard and the\r\nrest of his troops, entered the city by the old Dee Bridge on September\r\n23rd, and lodged that night at Sir Francis Gamul’s, in Lower Bridge\r\nStreet. It is interesting to know that a portion of this house still\r\nremains, though its external appearance has been absolutely changed. It\r\nwas on the following day that the battle of Rowton Heath, so disastrous\r\nto the King’s cause, took place. The defeat was in great measure due\r\nto misunderstandings, and the fact that the soldiers of the garrison\r\ndid not know the situation in which Sir Marmaduke Langdale, in command\r\nof the Royalist cavalry, was placed. The result of this was that Sir\r\nMarmaduke was surrounded and overpowered, and forced to retire towards\r\nChester. Some of his horse were scattered over the country, crossing\r\nthe river at Boughton Ford, or making for Holt Bridge, whilst those\r\nwho accompanied him became entangled in the narrow lanes leading to\r\nthe city, and there was a general rout. The King, attended by Sir\r\nFrancis Gamul and Alderman Cowper, had the mortification of witnessing\r\nthe disaster from the leads of the Phœnix Tower, at the north-east\r\nangle of the city walls. In this battle many gentlemen and officers\r\nof distinction lost their lives, or were taken prisoners; and it\r\nis computed that not less than 600 men were killed on both sides,\r\nand amongst the slain was Bernard Stuart, the young, gallant Earl\r\nof Lichfield, whilst Sir Philip Musgrave was taken prisoner. On the\r\nfollowing day the King, accompanied by Sir Francis Gamul, Captain\r\nThropp, and others, and with 500 horse, marched over Dee Bridge into\r\nWales, and so to Denbigh Castle. Before his departure he gave orders\r\nto Lord Byron and his commissioners, “if after ten days they saw no\r\nprospect of relief to treat for their own preservation.” It will be\r\nseen from this that he judged that the city was in great danger, and\r\nthat it could hardly be expected to hold out much longer.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Gamul and his companions remained with the King for a\r\ncouple of days, took a sad and final farewell of their Sovereign,\r\nand then returned to Chester. They found the city in an even more\r\ndistressed condition, for the enemy had again forced the works at\r\nBoughton, and were close up to the walls, and in possession of the\r\npart of the town just outside the Eastgate. For at least a week the\r\ndaily onslaught of the besieging forces was of the most determined\r\ncharacter. They planted their cannon at close quarters, and effected\r\na breach in the walls near the Newgate, and in many parts destroyed\r\nthe battlements. At night time the damage was repaired as far as was\r\npossible. The several assaults of the enemy were met with a stout and\r\nstubborn resistance. On October 7th, having surrounded the city with\r\ntheir cavalry, a violent and determined attack was made upon the walls\r\nin many parts, which were as resolutely defended. Great courage and\r\ndetermination were exhibited on both sides, and when the assailants in\r\nsome places gained the top of the walls they were beaten off, thrown\r\ndown and killed, and the scaling-ladders which they had used were taken\r\npossession of. So powerful had this resistance proved to be, that the\r\nbesiegers gave up their intention of storming the city, and changed\r\ntheir plan into that of a close blockade, trusting to subdue by famine\r\nthose whom they were unable to conquer by force.\r\n\r\nThe position of the city was not improved by the fact that Beeston\r\nCastle, after a siege lasting eighteen months, and after great\r\nprivations suffered by the garrison, at this time had to capitulate to\r\nthe Parliamentarians. The Governor secured very honourable conditions,\r\nhe and his men being allowed to march out with horses and arms and with\r\ncolours flying, a convoy being provided to guard them to Flint Castle.\r\nThe besieged in Chester had now a very trying time. Their opponents had\r\nconstructed a floating bridge over the river at Boughton which proved\r\na considerable annoyance to them, whilst affording much help to those\r\nwho had contrived it. An ineffectual attempt to burn it down was made\r\nby turning adrift at high tide two boats filled with combustibles,\r\nbut though the trains caught fire they were speedily extinguished. A\r\nbrisk sally out of the city with 500 horse and 200 foot also met with\r\nno success. Sir William Brereton again proposed a surrender, but Lord\r\nByron and the commissioners insisted upon terms which he felt he could\r\nnot grant.\r\n\r\nOn December 10th, orders were sent by Parliament for the Lancashire\r\nforces under Colonel Booth to join Sir William Brereton, and in a few\r\ndays they arrived, to the consternation of those within the city,\r\nwhich was now quite encompassed, and a scarcity of provisions was soon\r\noccasioned. Sir William Brereton, in January 1646, sent again and again\r\na summons to the besieged to surrender, but this was refused nine\r\ntimes, although they had to feed on horses, dogs, and cats, and boiled\r\nwheat, as the hope was entertained that the King might still be able to\r\ncome to their relief. It was only when all chance of this had vanished\r\nthat a treaty was agreed upon, and a large number of commissioners\r\non each side were appointed to draw up the terms of it. Accordingly\r\n“Articles of Surrender,” seventeen in number, were devised and agreed\r\nto, and signed on February 3, 1646. It is a singular coincidence that\r\nthis day happened to be, in former times, the Feast of St. Werburgh,\r\nwho might be called the patron saint of the city. These Articles of\r\nSurrender are very interesting, and may be accounted very generous.\r\nIn them “liberty to march out of the city, castle, and fort with all\r\ntheir apparel whatsoever and no other” was granted to all, the amount\r\nof money which each should carry being fixed, and ranging from forty\r\npounds in money and twenty pounds in plate for Lord and Lady Byron to\r\ntwenty shillings for lieutenants, cornets, ensigns, and other inferior\r\nofficers in commission; arrangements were made for the protection of\r\nwomen and prisoners and for the prevention of pillage and plunder; no\r\nchurch within the city, or evidence or writing belonging to the same,\r\nwas to be defaced; those who marched out of the town had liberty to\r\nmarch to Conway, and facilities were granted to them for this purpose;\r\n“the friends of the Earls of Derby and Lichfield, or any of those whose\r\ndead bodies were not yet interred in the city, had two months’ time\r\ngiven them to fetch them from thence whither they pleased, provided\r\nthey came attended by not more than twenty horse”; and hostages were to\r\nbe given for the due performance of the said Articles.\r\n\r\nThus, after a sturdy resistance of three years and a half, the city\r\nwas taken, after proving its unflinching loyalty to the King and his\r\ncause. In this respect Chester stands out in a remarkable manner,\r\nand may be said to vie with Oxford in its devotion to Charles I. The\r\ndamage inflicted on it was immense, and a very moderate calculation\r\nhas estimated it at £200,000. Randle Holme has given an interesting\r\ndescription of the damage done, mentioning many specific instances, and\r\nending with this: “This may be an advertisement to us that God’s mercy\r\nis yet to be found, since he hath left so many streets, lanes, and\r\nchurches unmolested. God grant us faith, patience, and true repentance\r\nand amendment, that a worse danger befall us not. Amen.” The same\r\nwriter, alluding to the attack on September 29, 1645, says: “By this\r\ntime our women are all on fire, striving through a gallant emulation\r\nto out-do our men, and will make good our yielding walls or lose their\r\nlives to show they dare attempt it. The work goes forward, and they,\r\nlike so many Amazons, do outface death, and dare danger though it\r\nlurks in every basket; seven are shot and three slain, yet they scorn\r\nto leave their matchless undertaking, and thus they continued for ten\r\ndays’ space, possessing the beholders that they are immaculate!” It\r\nwill be seen from this contemporary description that the annals of the\r\nperiod, if fully chronicled, would afford a wonderful story of bravery\r\nand endurance and patience, and would add lustre to the fame of the\r\nancient city of Chester. Even this imperfect sketch may not be out of\r\nplace, but may lead us to admire the chivalry and loyalty and courage\r\nof those brave defenders of our walls in bygone days.\r\n\r\nSir William Brereton’s forces were not very particular as to the\r\nobservance of the treaty. The sword and mace were indeed restored to\r\nthe city, but much injury was done to the Cathedral, where the choir\r\nwas defaced, the organ damaged, the stained-glass windows broken, and\r\nthe font demolished. The High Cross was also taken down, and the fonts\r\ntaken out of several of the parish churches, in which also many of the\r\nancient monuments were destroyed. As a result, very few of the latter\r\nof an early date are found now in Chester. The Gamul and Oldfield\r\nmonuments in the Church of St. Mary on the Hill were preserved by a\r\nspecial agreement with Sir William Brereton. The Church of St. John\r\nsuffered much, as it was so long in the possession of the enemy, being\r\nwithout the city walls. No doubt in other respects the terms of the\r\n“Articles of Surrender” were violated.\r\n\r\nThe following fuller descriptions of the visit of the King will not be\r\nout of place as an appendix to this paper. I am indebted for them to\r\nthe Rev. Canon Morris, D.D., F.S.A., who had supplied them for another\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n “From the account in Harleian 2155, &c., it would appear that the\r\n citizens were surprised when active operations were resumed on\r\n September 20, 1645. A force detached from the troops besieging Beeston\r\n Castle, and consisting of 500 horse, 200 dragoons, and 700 foot,\r\n advanced stealthily by ways through the country in the dead of the\r\n night, and at daybreak proceeded to storm the suburbs. Seizing, with\r\n little loss (either by treachery or through the negligence of the\r\n garrison), a mount near Deeside at Boughton, they set upon the main\r\n line of defences, and captured all the mounds on that side of the\r\n city. Then forcing their way through the Bars into Foregate Street,\r\n they obtained possession of the north-western suburb up to the\r\n Eastgate, taking as a trophy and a ‘token of good presage,’ the city\r\n sword and mace, which was probably in the Mayor’s house in St. John’s\r\n Ward, afterwards occupied by Sir W. Brereton as his headquarters. This\r\n success encouraged the Parliamentarians to hope that with a special\r\n effort the siege of Chester might be brought to a rapid close, and the\r\n authorities in London despatched urgent messages to the neighbouring\r\n counties calling for immediate reinforcements. Chester was regarded as\r\n a place of very great consequence (especially by Parliamentarians),\r\n both for the reducing and settling of all North Wales, and for the\r\n preventing of the landing of any Irish supplies. The citizens were\r\n equally active in taking precautions against the expected assaults in\r\n force. The East Gate was rammed up with earth. The houses in Cow Lane,\r\n St. John’s Lane, and St. Thomas’ Street (on the Boughton side) were\r\n burnt to deprive the enemy of shelter. Occasional sallies were made\r\n with indifferent success, and marksmen on the walls and towers were\r\n keeping up a continual fire. The besiegers were equally busy on their\r\n side. From the steeple of St. John’s Church they had an excellent\r\n position for annoying the citizens, and on Monday, September 22, a\r\n large breach was made by their artillery in the walls near the New\r\n Gate, sufficient to admit ten men abreast. Vigorous attempts were made\r\n to make good this breach with beds and wool-packs.\r\n\r\n “They were ordered to carry the beds, &c., one half to St. Bridget’s;\r\n and, after a sharp fight, at eight in the evening the enemy were\r\n beaten back with considerable loss by the courageous defence of the\r\n Chirk Castle troop. A simultaneous attempt was made by another body\r\n to scale the walls on the east between the Sadler’s Tower and the East\r\n Gate, but they were beaten off with much loss.\r\n\r\n “King Charles at this time was on his way from Hereford, intending to\r\n pass through Lancashire and Cumberland into Scotland. On receiving\r\n information of the critical position at Chester he marched at once\r\n for the city, which he entered with some hazard, at Handbridge, on\r\n Tuesday, September 23, attended by Lord Lichfield, Lord Gerard, and\r\n a small bodyguard. The King lodged that night at Sir Francis Gamul’s\r\n house in Bridge Street. The remainder of the King’s troops under Sir\r\n Marmaduke Langdale marched on towards Holt, and, crossing the Dee by\r\n the bridge, took up a position on Rowton Heath, about two miles from\r\n Chester. Here, early in the morning, he encountered General Poyntz,\r\n who had been ordered by the Parliament Committee to follow the King\r\n and prevent him from relieving Chester. Although his horse was tired\r\n with the long march overnight, Langdale succeeded in beating back\r\n Poyntz with considerable loss. He at once sent by Col. Shakerley to\r\n inform the King that he had obeyed his orders in checking Poyntz’s\r\n advance, and to ask for further orders. The Colonel executed his\r\n orders with better speed than could be expected, for he galloped\r\n directly to the river Dee under Huntingdon House, got a wooden tub\r\n (used for slaughtering swine) and a batting staff (used for batting of\r\n coarse linen) for an oar, put a servant into the tub with him, and in\r\n this desperate manner swam over the river, his horse swimming by him\r\n (for the banks there were very steep and the river very deep), ordered\r\n his servant to stay there with the tub for his return, and was with\r\n the King in little more than a quarter of one hour after he left Sir\r\n Marmaduke. This expeditious method saved him going the nine or ten\r\n miles about by Holt Bridge.\r\n\r\n “This speedy transmission of intelligence did not save the situation.\r\n Although preparations were made early in the day for a sally, and\r\n the citizens were busy clearing out the dung that barred up the gate\r\n which led to the suburbs, such delays were made by some about the\r\n King, that no orders were sent, nor any sally made out of the city\r\n by the King’s party till past three o’clock in the afternoon, which\r\n was full six hours after Poyntz had been beaten back. Through some\r\n misunderstanding Lord Gerard ordered Langdale to draw nearer Chester,\r\n where some foot would be ready to support him. This was impracticable,\r\n as Sir Marmaduke would then have been open to attack in rear as\r\n well as in front. For Poyntz had now had time to rally his forces,\r\n and, in obedience to his message, was reinforced about noon by 500\r\n horse and 300 foot under Col. Jones, the Adjutant General, drawn\r\n hurriedly from the force besieging Chester. This hasty march of the\r\n Parliamentarians was mistaken for flight, and a considerable portion\r\n of the garrison with Lord Gerard and Lord Lichfield were ordered to\r\n pursue, passing through the North Gate round by Flookersbrook, as the\r\n direct way by the East Gate had been blocked up. Before they could\r\n learn their mistake Poyntz fell upon Langdale, who was thus compelled\r\n to meet his assault in front, as well as Col. Jones’ attack in rear,\r\n and notwithstanding a gallant resistance he was routed, and forced\r\n to retire in the direction of Hoole Heath. Here the Royalist horse\r\n became disordered, and the narrow lanes and passes between there and\r\n Chester so crowded, that they were unable to make an effectual stand,\r\n and, in fact, threw their supporters under Lord Gerard into immediate\r\n confusion. Some made for Holt Bridge, others crossed the river at\r\n Dee-fords, and so into the city; but Poyntz, satisfied with his\r\n success, made no attempt to pursue them. No less than 600 men fell in\r\n this battle, amongst them several of high rank and distinction: more\r\n than 800 prisoners were taken. Amongst the slain was Bertie Stuart,\r\n the young Earl of Lichfield. The King, attended by the Mayor, Sir\r\n Francis Gamul, and Alderman Cowper, had the unhappiness of watching\r\n this disaster, first from the Phœnix Tower, and afterwards from the\r\n Cathedral Tower, where, as he was talking with a captain, a bullet\r\n from St. John’s gave him a salute, narrowly missing the King, hit the\r\n said captain on the head, and killed him on the spot. Owing to this\r\n disaster, it was not thought advisable that the King should remain\r\n in Chester. Before his departure he called the Mayor and leading\r\n citizens together, and desired them, if he was unable to send them the\r\n aid he expected within eight or ten days, to make the best terms of\r\n surrender they could. Instead of pursuing his route to Scotland, he\r\n returned into Wales, passing over Dee Bridge between nine and ten in\r\n the morning, accompanied by Sir F. Gamul, Capt. Thorpe, and Alderman\r\n Cowper. After staying three hours at Hawarden Castle, he reached\r\n Denbigh Castle the same night.”\r\n\r\n\r\n FROM SLINGSBY’S DIARY.\r\n\r\n “By ye wayes we took through ye almost inaccessible mountains of\r\n Wales, y^t we heard no more of Poyntz, nor did he trouble us much\r\n till we got to Chester; and though he troubled us not, yet found we\r\n both loss and trouble in our passage: loss in our horses, many of y^m\r\n tireing so, y^t ye Troopers were fain to forsake y^m. In our Quarters\r\n we had little accommodation, but of all ye places we came to ye best\r\n at Old Radnor, where ye King lay in a poor low chamber, and my Lord\r\n of Linsey and others by ye Kitching fire on hay: no better were we\r\n accommodated for victuals: which makes me remember this passage; while\r\n ye King was at his supper eating a pullet and a piece of cheese, ye\r\n room without was full but ye men’s stomachs empty for want of meat.\r\n Ye good wife troubled w^{th} continual calling upon her for victuals,\r\n and having it seems but ye one cheese, comes into ye room where ye\r\n King was, and very soberly asks if ye King had done with ye cheese for\r\n ye gentlemen w^{th}out desired it. But ye best was we never tarried\r\n long in any place, & therefore might we more willingly endure one\r\n night’s hardship in hopes that ye next might be better. And thus we\r\n continued our march until we came to Chester, when we found my Lord\r\n Byron in command in ye town & ye enemy in ye suburbs, and so close\r\n y^t it was some hazard to ye King to pass ye bridge. Now, our horse\r\n quartered about 3 miles off, except only ye King’s life-guard and my\r\n Lord Garrard’s (Charles Gerard, created L^d Gerard Nov. 8 this year)\r\n horse, both w^h were drawn into ye town, & preparations made ye next\r\n day to have a sally, but while they were busy to carry out ye dung\r\n that barricaded up ye gate y^t led to ye suburbs a messenger came y^t\r\n brought ye King’s word y^t Poyntz had engaged Sir Marmaduke Langdale\r\n to fight, & a little after we heard y^t we had taken some colours of\r\n ye enemy’s, but y^t ye King must send supplys, by reason y^t ye enemy\r\n increased by that assistance they had from neighbouring garrisons\r\n which flocked to them. Whereupon ye King sent forth both Lord\r\n Lichfield and Lord Gerard with those that were in ye town, but before\r\n they could joyne our horse were beaten, and in ye view of ye town & of\r\n ye King, who at ye very same time was in one of ye towers of ye Walls,\r\n looking over to see our men & theirs in ye suburbs exchanging some\r\n bullets one with another. We took it first for ye enemy till some came\r\n wounded & brought in ye sad news y^t our horse was routed, many taken,\r\n and my Lord Lichfield slain.\r\n\r\n “Here I do wonder at ye admirable temper of ye King, whose constancy\r\n was such y^t no perils never so unavoidable could move him to\r\n astonishment, but y^t still he set ye same face & settled countenance\r\n upon what adverse fortune soever befell him, & neither was exalted\r\n in prosperity nor dejected in adversity; w^h was ye more admirable\r\n in him, seeing he had no other to have recourse unto for counsel &\r\n assistance, but must bear ye whole burden upon his shoulder. By this\r\n accident I never found him moved at all, though the loss was so much\r\n & greater by my Lord of Lichfield’s death, his kinsman, & whom he\r\n loved so dearly. But this makes him look nearer for his own safety,\r\n & therefore gives order for his march ye next day with those horse\r\n y^t came safe to ye town; which he left without all hopes of relief\r\n to make conditions for themselves for the town if they durst attempt\r\n no more. We marched over ye bridge in ye day, having set up some\r\n blinds if they might not take notice so easily when ye King passed\r\n over, & except one horse that was killed, I think no others took any\r\n harm. From hence we marched on to Denbigh Castle, and after that to\r\n Ruthin, till at last by unknown ways and passages, with many dark &\r\n late marches, we arrived at ye garrison of Newark about ye 14^{th} of\r\n October.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above contemporary accounts will enable us to realise both the\r\ngravity of the situation in the city, and the difficulties which beset\r\nthe Royalist troops in their journeys through the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHESHIRE AND ITS FAMILIES\r\n\r\n  By James Hall\r\n\r\n  _Author of “A History of Nantwich,” “The Civil War in Cheshire,” &c._\r\n\r\n\r\nCheshire, in regard to its shape, has been said to resemble a bird’s\r\nwing, an axe-head, and a shoulder of mutton. The late Colonel Egerton\r\nLegh humorously compared it to a chicken with its head in Featherbed\r\nMoss, Macclesfield in its crop, and the tail formed by Wirral. Perhaps\r\nmore seriously, but no less fancifully, it may be likened to a broad,\r\near-topped shield of the College of Arms type, divided palewise by\r\na central line of hills, of which the isolated rocks of Halton and\r\nBeeston occupy respectively the chief point and the fesse point of the\r\nshield.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of Beeston Castle, or, better still, from the more\r\nelevated escarpment of the adjacent Peckforton Hill, marked on the\r\nsurvey map _Stanner Nab_--a name little altered from its original\r\nSaxon, _Stan-es Nebb_, literally “front of stone,” or stone head,\r\nand now commonly called _Tanner’s Nob_--nearly the whole county is\r\nspread out in fine panorama of plain; the view extending from the\r\nWirral coast to the high moorlands of Macclesfield, a distance of\r\nabout fifty miles; and from the Mersey to the Shropshire border, a\r\nlittle over thirty miles. A like distant and picturesque horizon is\r\nobtainable from eminences such as Alderley Edge, Cloud End, and Mow\r\nCop on the east; Frodsham Hill, Helsby Tor, and Halton Castle on the\r\nnorth; Carden Cliff, Harthill, and Belvidere in Wirswall on the south\r\nborder. From gentle uplands, the more circumscribed landscape presents\r\nthe effect of a tree-covered plain, owing to the great quantity of\r\nhedgerow timber, chiefly oak, and the smallness of the fields. This\r\nillusion is perfect when the view is taken from the cupola on the roof\r\nof Doddington Hall; but in reality the county is almost destitute of\r\nwoods, excepting spinnies, often hidden in dingles, and the rather\r\nmodern plantations on the central hills. There are, however, extensive\r\nparks at Dunham, Tatton, Tabley, Arley, Lyme, Peover, Somerford,\r\nOulton, Vale Royal, Eaton, Cholmondeley, Combermere, Doddington, and\r\nCrewe; although some mentioned in history have been disparked, as at\r\nKermincham and Norbury Booths.\r\n\r\nCheshire is a county of large estates, many of which have descended by\r\na long ancestry to the present owners. The greatest estates occur in\r\nthe purely agricultural and sparsely populated districts of the south.\r\nIn order of their extent comes first the Peckforton estate, 25,380\r\nacres (Lord Tollemache); next Cholmondeley, 16,842 acres (the Marquis\r\nof Cholmondeley); then Eaton, 15,001 acres (the Duke of Westminster);\r\nDoddington, 13,832 acres (Sir Delves L. Broughton, Bart.); and Crewe,\r\n10,148 acres (Earl Crewe); but this last estate does not include the\r\nrailway town of that name. Other large landowners[47] (most of whose\r\nnames are historic in the county, and whose estates vary between 5000\r\nand 10,000 acres) are--\r\n\r\nThe Lords--Egerton of Tatton, Harrington, Stamford, Derby, Haddington,\r\nDe Tabley, Delamere, Stanley of Alderley (Sheffield), Kilmorrey,\r\nShrewsbury, and Combermere. Also Sir Philip Grey-Egerton, Mr. Legh [now\r\nLord Newton] of Lyme, Mr. Legh of Adlington, Mr. Egerton-Warburton of\r\nArley, Sir W. G. Shakerley, Mr. Bromley Davenport, and Colonel France\r\nHayhurst.\r\n\r\n [47] This list of names is taken from the published returns to the\r\n House of Commons of the “Owners of Land” throughout the United Kingdom,\r\n commonly called the _Modern Domesday Book_, of 1873.\r\n\r\nThese twenty-three gentlemen own collectively 203,533 acres, or a\r\nlittle over one-third of the whole county; but, according to the same\r\nauthority, 2840 persons own lands varying from 10 to 1000 acres, also\r\n3166 persons have holdings between one acre and ten acres, while 17,691\r\npersons possess lands less than one acre in extent. The Crown lands\r\namount to 3581 acres, and the commons or waste lands to 6704 acres, so\r\nthat the total number of owners in Cheshire is 23,720, the total area\r\nof the county being 608,922 acres, or rather less than 1000 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nSome houses of the gentry have from ancient times stood on the margin\r\nof a natural mere, as at Tatton, Tabley, Mere, Rostherne, Arley,\r\nCombermere, and Marbury; or beside an artificial pool, as at Crewe and\r\nDoddington. But Bagmere, which once reflected the stately mansion of\r\nthe Breretons, has been drained, and Ridley Pool has long been “sown\r\nand mown,” in fulfilment, as credulous people have believed, of Nixon’s\r\nprophecy. Barmere is one of the few meres that have not been honoured\r\nby a gentleman’s seat.\r\n\r\nOf modern mansions, both the magnificent palace at Eaton and the castle\r\nat Cholmondeley stand near ornamental sheets of water; while Peckforton\r\nCastle, perhaps the most remarkable house in all England, being built\r\nin close imitation of a Norman castle, is perched on a rocky eminence\r\nlike an eyrie.\r\n\r\nIn no part of Cheshire are so many gentlemen’s seats clustered together\r\nas within a radius of a few miles around the old-fashioned town of\r\nKnutsford. They are as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Dunham Hall_, or Dunham Massey, as it was named in ancient times, when\r\nit was held as a feudal barony by the Massey family until the death of\r\nHamon, about the year 1340, stands in what is known as the Old Park,\r\nwhich is walled round for the protection of about a hundred head of\r\ndeer. The so-called New Park, nearly three miles in circumference, also\r\ncontains aged oaks and beeches, and is divided from the other park\r\nmerely by the road leading from Bowdon to Dunham village. From the\r\nMasseys the estate descended to the notable family of Booth. At the\r\nold mansion lived Sir John Booth, who was slain at Flodden Field; Sir\r\nGeorge Booth, created Baron Delamere in 1661 in honour of his staunch\r\nroyalist services to Charles I.; and his son Henry, second lord, who,\r\nafter having been three times unjustly imprisoned in the Tower, was in\r\n1686 tried for high treason by his peers and acquitted.\r\n\r\n_High Leigh._--Here two important mansions stood in close proximity,\r\nnamely, East Hall and West Hall. The latter, or what remains of it,\r\nwas changed into a farmhouse nearly a century ago. The former, rebuilt\r\ntowards the end of the eighteenth century as a brick mansion, is still\r\nthe residence of the Legh family, which has been seated there since the\r\ntime of Edward I. In the reign of Henry VII. there was much litigation\r\nbetween the Leghs of the two halls.\r\n\r\n_Rostherne Hall_, long the residence of the Masseys of Coddington, and\r\nnow the property of Lord Egerton, stands on the border of a broad mere,\r\nas much famed for its curious legends as for the natural beauty of its\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n_Ashley Hall_, where, in 1715, ten Cheshire gentlemen, namely, Thomas\r\nAssheton, the resident proprietor; Sir Richard Grosvenor, of Eaton;\r\nJames, Earl Barrymore, of Marbury; Charles Hurleston, of Newton; Amos\r\nMeredith, of Henbury; Alexander Radclyff, of Fox Denton in Lancashire,\r\nbut born at Wythenshawe in Cheshire in 1677; Robert Cholmondeley, of\r\nHolford; John Warren, of Poynton; Henry Legh, of Legh; and Peter Legh,\r\nof Lyme; met to discuss the propriety of espousing the cause of the Old\r\nPretender, the Chevalier St. George, the decision arrived at being in\r\nthe negative by the casting vote of the owner of Ashley.\r\n\r\n_Tatton Hall_, anciently the seat of the knightly family of Massey,\r\nfrom the time of Edward I. to the time of Henry VI., descended in the\r\ntime of Charles II. to the Egerton family, and is now owned by Lord\r\nEgerton. The present mansion, designed by the two Wyatts, has for its\r\nchief external feature a portico of columns 25 feet high, and stands in\r\nthe centre of a park nearly 12 miles in circumference. The old hall,\r\nhalf a mile away, is situate on low, sheltered ground at the north end\r\nof the lake.\r\n\r\n_Mere Hall._--The old hall, long the residence of the ancient family\r\nof Mere, stood nearer the village, but only a portion of it now\r\nremains, used as a farmhouse. This estate has been in the possession\r\nof the Brooke family since 1652. Mr. Peter Langford Brooke, who, in\r\n1834, built the present brick mansion overlooking the mere, had the\r\nmisfortune to be drowned while skating on the mere on 9th January 1840,\r\nhis wife witnessing the sad occurrence.\r\n\r\n_Arley Hall_, the seat of the Warburton family for several centuries,\r\nwas demolished in 1833, and the present handsome structure, with its\r\nchapel designed by Salvin (who was also the architect of Peckforton\r\nCastle), was not completed until 1845. Over the stone porch doorway is\r\ncarved the following rhyme by the squire of the hall:--\r\n\r\n    “This Gate is free to all Good Men and True,\r\n     Right Welcome thou, if worthy to pass through.”\r\n\r\n_Marbury Hall_,[48] possessed by the Marbury family for many\r\ngenerations until the death of Richard Marbury in 1684. Since the\r\neighteenth century it has belonged to the family of Barry. The present\r\nmansion, overlooking Budworth Mere, was built by the architect, Mr. A.\r\nSalvin, in the French château style.\r\n\r\n [48] On the southern border of the county is another _Marbury Hall_,\r\n late the residence of Cudworth H. Poole, Esq., beautifully situated on\r\n a hill that commands the view of two meres and a picturesque church and\r\n village of the same name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tabley House and Chapel.]\r\n\r\n_Tabley Hall_, which resembles Tatton in architecture, was completed\r\nin the year 1769. The old hall, now in a ruinous condition, and in\r\ndanger of becoming a tumbled heap by its thick mantling of ivy,\r\ntogether with a detached brick chapel dated 1675, stand on an island\r\nin the circling mere. This was the home of Sir Peter Leycester, the\r\nrepresentative of a long lineage, and the first great historian of\r\nCheshire families, who was buried at Budworth in 1678.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned halls lie on the northern and western sides of\r\nKnutsford; two others are on the south side of that town, namely:--\r\n\r\n_Toft Hall_, another seat of the Leycester family for many generations,\r\nand remarkable now for its fine avenue of elms in triple rows. Ralph\r\nLeycester, who died in 1777, owned this estate for no fewer than 70\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n_Peover Hall_ is associated with the Mainwarings from Plantagenet\r\ntimes, whose surname, according to the antiquary Dugdale, had undergone\r\n131 variations of spellings in old deeds. Sir Henry Mainwaring, who\r\ndied unmarried on 6th April 1797, was the last direct descendant.\r\nBy his will the estate came to his uterine half-brother, Thomas\r\nWettenhall, of Nantwich, who took the name and arms of Mainwaring, and,\r\ndying the following year, on 12th July 1798, thus became the ancestor\r\nof the present line of baronets of Peover.\r\n\r\nFarther away from Knutsford, on the borders of Delamere Forest, stand\r\nthree notable houses; namely, _Delamere House_, designed by Wyatt, and\r\nowned by Mr. Wilbraham, who is the direct descendant of the ancient\r\nfamily of Wilbraham of Woodhey in the south part of the county; _Vale\r\nRoyal_, the seat of the present Lord Delamere, that estate having been\r\npurchased in 1615 by the noble lady, Mary Cholmondeley, widow of Sir\r\nHugh Cholmondeley, and known in history as “the bold lady of Cheshire,”\r\nwho entertained King James I. on his progress through the county in\r\n1617; and _Utkinton Hall_, now a farmhouse with some remains of its\r\nformer importance, which in the same year, 1617, was the residence\r\nof the forester, Sir John Done, who had married Dorothy, daughter of\r\nThomas Wilbraham of Woodhey, whose manners and character were “so\r\namiable that to this day” (as Thomas Pennant says in 1782), “when a\r\nCheshire man would express some excellency in one of the fair sex, he\r\nwould say, ‘There is a Lady Done for you!’”\r\n\r\nVery fine specimens of ancient timber houses are at Bramhall, Little\r\nMoreton, Adlington; and the hall at Baguley, perhaps the oldest\r\nbuilding of its kind in the county, has massive oak beams, still in\r\ngood condition, proving the durability of that material for building\r\nconstruction. Of stone and brick mansions, Brereton is the best example\r\nof Tudor architecture; Dorfold and Crewe of the seventeenth century\r\nrenaissance; Oulton, Lyme, and Doddington of the later palladian style.\r\n\r\nOther halls constructed wholly or in part of timber, and once occupied\r\nby the yeomen class--the charterers or freeholders named on old manor\r\ncourt-rolls--whose estates have been swallowed up in the larger\r\nproperties, were usually defended by deeply-dug, rectangular moats,\r\nindicative of an unsettled and dangerous state of life in former times.\r\nAt Huxley Old Hall, at Harden, at Moreton, and elsewhere, moats and\r\ndrawbridges still exist; but some moated enclosures have been turned\r\ninto orchards, and a farmhouse has been built outside, as at Mickley in\r\nWrenbury parish, and at Stapeley in Wybunbury parish.\r\n\r\nFormerly Cheshire people frequently married with neighbouring families\r\nof like station in life, according to their common proverb, “It is\r\nbetter to marry over the mixen than over the moor;” and even yet there\r\nis a saying: “If you are going into Cheshire, remember they are all\r\ncousins.”\r\n\r\nThe long-established peasant families must not be passed over in\r\nsilence. Suspicious of strangers, they understand “the law of the\r\nland” very differently from the inhabitants of crowded cities and\r\nmanufacturing towns. Country people still speak with confidence and\r\nrespect of “our squire,” just as the landlords talk of “our people”;\r\nalthough it must be admitted that the mutual social influences of old\r\nEnglish life are now fast waning. A former manifestation of goodwill\r\nand good understanding among the tenantry of a large estate may here\r\nbe mentioned. On the death of the Rev. Sir Thomas Broughton, Bart.,\r\nin July 1813, the coffin containing his remains was borne to burial\r\non the shoulders of relays of farmers by road from Doddington Hall to\r\nBroughton Church, a distance of no less than twelve miles!\r\n\r\nThe numerous townships into which Cheshire is divided are almost\r\nentirely rural in their situation; and in few parts of the county,\r\nWirral being the chief exception, are the dwellings sufficiently near\r\neach other to constitute what is generally known as a village. I have\r\nheard a countryman express this peculiarity in these words: “The common\r\npeople live in the lanes, but the quality (that is, the well-to-do\r\nfarmers) live up in the fields.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to Cheshire families in the dim past, Camden the\r\nantiquary of the sixteenth century wrote:[49] “Cheshire is the great\r\nnursing-mother of the gentry; for there is no other English county that\r\nformerly supplied the King’s army with more nobility, or that could\r\nnumber more knightly families.”\r\n\r\n [49] The original words in the _Britannia_ read: “Cestria eximia\r\n nobilitatis altrix; nec enim alia est in Anglia provincia, quæ plures\r\n nobiles in aciem eduxerit, et plures equestres familias numerarit.”\r\n\r\nContemporary with Camden, John Speed, the historian, a native of the\r\ncounty, calls Cheshire the “seed-plot of gentility.” In proof of this,\r\nwe refer to the statement already made in the historical introduction\r\nto this volume, that William the Conqueror constituted Cheshire a\r\ncounty palatine, bestowing the earldom on his nephew, Hugh Lupus, whose\r\ntitle, Earl of Chester, has belonged, since the time of Edward I., by\r\nhereditary right to the heir-apparent of the English Crown. Cheshire,\r\nlike Normandy in France, thus became an _imperium in imperio_, with\r\nthe Earl as titular sovereign and courts of justice, administered by\r\na Constable, Seneschall, Chamberlain, Justices, Barons of Exchequer,\r\nSheriff, Attorney, Escheator, &c. So constituted, the county preserved\r\nits independent existence until the time of Henry VIII., when it became\r\nsubject to the Crown; and in the next reign the county sent its first\r\nrepresentatives to the national Parliament at Westminster. The first\r\nEarl held a large part of the earldom in his own hands; and portioned\r\nout the rest of the land among military men, whom he created barons,\r\nor tenants _in capite_; and their hereditary honorary services for\r\ntheir fees were due to him and his successors. In course of time these\r\nfees became a civil establishment rather than a military plan, and the\r\nservices began to be compounded. Agricultural and other services grew\r\nout of the sub-infeudations of the chief tenants; and eventually, by\r\na statute, 12 Chas. II., local baronies and manors became little more\r\nthan nominal institutions, and as such they continue to be.\r\n\r\nIt is said the Grosvenors are descended from Gilbert le Grosvenor, who\r\ncame over from Normandy with Hugh Lupus, his uncle; the Mainwarings\r\nfrom Earl Randle; and the Egertons and Cholmondeleys from the Norman\r\nBarons of Malpas. The ancient, but now extinct, families of Merbury,\r\nHatton, Rutter, Birkenhead, Vernon, Leftwich, and Fitton, each bore\r\nthree _garbs or_ (three golden wheatsheaves) on their shields, an\r\nhonourable charge claimed to have been assigned them by the sixth Earl,\r\nRandle Blundeville, who bore the same device. In modern times the\r\n_garb or_ occurs on the arms of Wicksted, Cholmondeley, and Grosvenor;\r\nand, in the last named, since the time of Richard II., when Sir Robert\r\nGrosvenor contended with the proud Sir Richard Scrope of Yorkshire in\r\nthe long heraldic suit (1386-1389) as to the right to bear _Azure a\r\nbend or_, with the result that Sir Robert should bear a golden sheaf\r\ninstead of a golden band, as descended from the Earls of Chester.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient days of chivalry the military aristocracy promoted peace\r\nand order within the county, and defended it against raids from beyond\r\nthe Welsh Marshes. Cheshire archers became famous; and, led by their\r\nown knights, gained renown in the wars of the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nIf military achievement be claimed in justification of the\r\nproverb--“Cheshire, chief of men”--quoted by Drayton, it must be\r\nremembered there was a rival in the field. The “Men of Kent,” who\r\nboldly said to William the Conqueror--\r\n\r\n    “We are ready to offer thee either Peace or War at thy own\r\n    choice and election--Peace with faithful obedience, if thou wilt\r\n    permit us to enjoy our liberties; War, and that most deadly, if\r\n    thou deny it”--\r\n\r\nhave a prior claim for daring manhood. But while Grose, the antiquary,\r\ninsinuated that the proverb was given to our noble selves _by_ our\r\nnoble selves, it may, after all, have had no more serious signification\r\nthan that Cheshire men always boasted of their isolation from other\r\nEnglish people.\r\n\r\nTruly the warrior-roll forms a long list of brave and hardy men,\r\nfrom Roger Lacy, the Constable of Cheshire in 1200, that magnanimous\r\nchampion of war in both France and Wales, down to Field-Marshal\r\nCombermere of Salamanca and Bhurtpore fame; but memorials abound of\r\nheroic endeavour in the arts of peace, in law and letters, as well as\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\nOf famous lawyers were Lord Chancellor Egerton and Sir Ranulph Crewe,\r\nthe Speaker of the House of Commons, in the seventeenth century. In the\r\nfollowing century were Randle Wilbraham, ancestor of the Wilbrahams of\r\nRode, and of Lathom House (now Lord Skelmersdale) in Lancashire; Sir\r\nJohn Chesshyre, who founded in 1733 a library at Halton, and was buried\r\nat Runcorn in 1738 with this epitaph:--\r\n\r\n    “An honest man’s the noblest work of God”:\r\n\r\nand Richard P. Arden, born at Stockport in 1745, who became Lord Chief\r\nJustice, Baron Alvanley, and died in 1804.\r\n\r\nOf talented men of letters were Dr. Broome, the poet, born at\r\nHaslington in 1689; and in our own time Lord de Tabley, eminent\r\nas poet, botanist, and author of the first work on the subject\r\nof book-plates; Sir Philip Egerton, the learned geologist and\r\nmineralogist; the Rev. A. P. Stanley, Dean of Westminster; and other\r\nworthies whose names are enshrined in the volumes of the _National\r\nBiographical Dictionary_.\r\n\r\nOf benefactors of their fellow-men were James Neild, born at Knutsford\r\nin 1774, the philanthropic prison-visitor; the Duke of Bridgewater,\r\npioneer of canal construction; George Wilbraham, Esq., of Delamere\r\nHouse, who died in 1813, and was one of the first to introduce an\r\nimproved system of agriculture into the county; the first Lord\r\nTollemache, who in his lifetime was everywhere spoken of as Cheshire’s\r\nmodel landlord; and many others who, holding positions of trust for the\r\ngeneral good, fulfilled their duties with integrity and honour, and to\r\nwhom we are all debtors.\r\n\r\nThere is another local proverb, expressed in curious rhyme and\r\nalliteration, that relates to the number and distribution of four\r\nCheshire family names:--\r\n\r\n    As many Leighs as fleas; Massies as asses;\r\n    Crewes as crows; and Davenports as dogs’ tails.\r\n\r\nThis is easy of explanation when multitudinous plebeians bearing the\r\nsame surnames are added to the following lists of genteel families:--\r\n\r\nThere were _Leghs_ of Legh, Northwood, Sandbach, Booths, Oughtrington,\r\nAdlington, Baguley, Lyme, and Ridge.\r\n\r\nThere were _Masseys_ of Massey, Coddington, Puddington, Tatton, and\r\nChester.\r\n\r\nThere were _Crewes_ of Crewe, Nantwich, Alvaston, Farndon, Holt,\r\nCholmondeston, and Utkinton.\r\n\r\nThere were _Davenports_ of Davenport, Woodford, Calveley, Wheltrough,\r\nBramhall, Henbury, Capesthorne, Blackhurst, Boughton, and Chorley.\r\n\r\nThe Davenport family had power of life and death over intruders\r\ninfesting the royal forest of Macclesfield; and their crest--a rogue’s\r\nhead, with a halter round the neck--must have been a constant reminder\r\nthat the Davenports were terrors to all evil-doers.\r\n\r\nThe Bramhall Davenports, who held that estate for more than five\r\nhundred years, have persistently borne the name of William; and for the\r\nsame length of time the Tattons of Wythenshawe have been named Robert\r\nand William alternately; while the owner of Carden has been John Leche\r\nfor sixteen successive generations!\r\n\r\nIn regard to curiosities of descent, it may here be restated that\r\nRobert Hyde, of Hyde, Esq., who died about the year 1528, left a son,\r\nLawrence Hyde, who, leaving Cheshire for Wiltshire, became the ancestor\r\nof the Hydes of Westhatch, from whom descended the celebrated Edward\r\nHyde, Earl of Clarendon, whose two granddaughters, Mary and Anne,\r\nbecame in succession Queens of England.\r\n\r\nFew counties in England have had their history so fully written\r\nand re-written as Cheshire; and therefore from this epitome of a\r\nwide-embracing subject the reader is referred to the writings of\r\nCamden, Webb, Fuller, Sir Peter Leycester, the Lysons, and the\r\nmonumental volumes of Dr. Ormerod’s _History of Cheshire_; to the\r\npublished transactions of the Record Society of Lancashire and\r\nCheshire, and of the historic societies of Manchester, Liverpool,\r\nand Chester; to many separate histories of towns and parishes in the\r\ncounty; and to the genealogical works of the late Mr. Earwaker, whose\r\nuntimely death in 1895 is still deplored by all who take an interest in\r\nthe records of family history.\r\n\r\nThis chapter shall close with the words of two Cheshire poets--the\r\none Geoffrey Whitney, who, living in Queen Elizabeth’s reign, wrote\r\nin praise of prominent Cheshire men of that time; the other, the late\r\nRowland Eyles Egerton-Warburton, “the rhyming squire of Arley,” in the\r\ntime of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nWhitney, in his _Emblem_, dedicated to “I. I. esquier,” says:--\r\n\r\n    Not for our selues alone wee are create,\r\n    But for our frendes, and for our countries good.\r\n\r\nMr. Egerton-Warburton composed these verse-mottoes for the shields that\r\ndecorate the two fireplaces in the dining-room at Arley Hall.\r\n\r\nUnder the Egerton shield:--\r\n\r\n    Since days of olden chivalry bequeathed from sire to son,\r\n    May honour keep untarnished still the shield which valour won.\r\n\r\nUnder the Warburton shield:--\r\n\r\n    If proud thou be of ancestors for worth and wisdom famed,\r\n    So live that they, if now alive, would not of thee be shamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  SOME CHESHIRE CROSSES\r\n\r\n  By the Archdeacon of Chester\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible, in the course of a short chapter, to give an\r\nadequate account of all the crosses in the county of which remains\r\nstill exist. On such a subject, as in the case of most counties, a\r\nvolume might be written. Nor will it be attempted even to refer to\r\nall of them or to give a complete list, and it may well be that some\r\ninteresting specimens will be omitted, or not mentioned here, not\r\nbecause they are not worthy of mention, but because there is not space\r\nto do justice to them.\r\n\r\nIt cannot but be a matter of regret that Puritan fanaticism was\r\nresponsible for the destruction of many, if not most, of these crosses\r\nthroughout the country. It has been computed that at least 5000 had\r\nbeen at various times erected, and they afforded not only types of\r\narchitectural design and ornament, but also historical evidence of\r\nformer times and customs.\r\n\r\nThe crosses varied much in form and character, as also in position and\r\norigin. Many of them, no doubt, were in the first instance _Preaching\r\nCrosses_. The monks or other early heralds of Christianity would rear\r\nup some simple or wooden cross to mark the place from which they would\r\naddress the people who came to hear them, and this would in process\r\nof time give place to a more permanent structure of stone, sometimes\r\nof an elaborate nature. Generally it would be elevated or raised upon\r\na platform of steps, sometimes few, but sometimes as many as eight\r\nor more. The cross itself might be enriched with the Figure or with\r\nsome inscription or pattern of some emblematic kind. After a time, in\r\nsome places, a church would be erected, and the cross or its successor\r\nwould become the _Churchyard Cross_. Where this did not happen, the\r\ncross would remain as a reminder to the people of the message that\r\nhad been delivered there, and to teach them that all their actions\r\nwere to have a religious purpose. In some instances the cross became a\r\n_Market Cross_, of which, in different parts of the country, we have\r\nvarious elaborate specimens. Here again the name, whether the form of\r\nthe cross was prominent or not, was evidently meant to suggest that\r\nthe transactions there carried on were to be true and just, as became\r\nChristian men. Sometimes the cross became “_the High Cross_,” where\r\njustice was administered and civic matters discussed; and in this case\r\nalso the title is most suggestive. In addition to these there were\r\n_Boundary Crosses_, by which would be implied the sin of removing a\r\nneighbour’s landmark; and _Weeping Crosses_, visited by penitents. Of\r\nall these, except, so far as I know, the latter, there are, of course,\r\nmany examples in the county, and of some of them this article will\r\ntreat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The High Cross, Chester.]\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, it is a matter of great regret that the _High\r\nCross_ has disappeared from its position in the city of Chester. It\r\nhas indeed left its name behind it, the junction of the four principal\r\nstreets in the centre of the city being still known as _The Cross_,\r\nand being so named not from the fact of the cross-roads being there,\r\nbut from the structure which once stood on the spot. This was a tall\r\nshaft with canopied head, on which were carved two rows of figures\r\nin niches, and on the top an orb surmounted by a cross. The civic\r\nbuildings were close at hand, being built on to St. Peter’s Church, and\r\nbeing styled _The Pentice_, probably from pent-house, as indicating\r\nthe way in which it was built on to the church. Though the offices of\r\nthe municipality have long since been moved to the Town Hall, the old\r\nname is still preserved, one of the courts over which the Recorder\r\npresides being called in documents “The Pentice Court.” The _High\r\nCross_ was taken down in 1646, when the Parliamentarians entered the\r\ncity, the other crosses having been destroyed in 1577 or earlier. It\r\nwas removed to Netherleigh House in the outskirts of the city, then the\r\nhome of the Cotgreaves. What is said to be the head of it is now in the\r\nGrosvenor Museum at Chester, but the carvings have been cut away, as\r\nit is quite plain; and the shaft is said to be in the grounds of Plas\r\nNewydd at Llangollen. The suggestion has been made that the cross might\r\nbe restored, and though it could not be placed again on its old site,\r\nowing to the confined space and the exigencies of traffic, it might\r\nfind a position of importance in some other part of the city. The _High\r\nCross_ was the scene of all great civic functions. Here, again and\r\nagain, royalty was received and conducted into the adjacent Pentice and\r\nentertained. Here proclamations were read out with due formality, and\r\nhere the Mystery Plays were represented, the first performance having\r\ntaken place at the Abbey Gate before the Abbot and his brethren. The\r\ncross would thus be associated in the minds of the citizens with much\r\nof their civic life, and many noteworthy events in their history, and\r\nfor this reason, if for no other, its removal is much to be regretted.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the destruction of crosses in\r\n1577 in and about Chester. In that year Sheriff Mutton seems to have\r\ndistinguished himself in this work, as we read that he pulled down\r\ncertain crosses by a commission from the Archbishop’s visitors. Some\r\nprobably had disappeared at an earlier date, for in 1543 the city\r\nmason was paid two days’ wages “for shiftyinge the cross” at St.\r\nMary’s-on-the-Hill. No doubt at this period many of the churchyard\r\ncrosses in the county, as well as in the city, were demolished.\r\nThis was often done by shortening the shaft, thus taking away the\r\ncross itself, and using the portion that was left as the basis for a\r\nsun-dial. This was sometimes a flat one, as at St. Mary’s-on-the-Hill,\r\nChester, and sometimes a four-sided one, as at Acton, where a very\r\nelaborate one of the latter description may be seen. In this latter\r\ncase the base, out of which the octagonal shaft rises, rests upon a\r\npedestal of three steps, and the square stone, with its dial-face on\r\neach side, is surmounted by a round knob. On the top of the cube there\r\nwas this inscription: on the north, “Tempus fugit: mors venit”; and on\r\nthe south, “Ut hora: sic vita.” Originally this cross must have been\r\nvery fine in its proportions, and a conspicuous object, whether it\r\noccupied its present position (at the west of the church) or not. In\r\nthe churchyard of St. John the Baptist, Chester, is a sun-dial, which\r\nprobably stands where the _Churchyard Cross_ stood, as marked in an\r\nold plan of the end of the fifteenth century preserved in the British\r\nMuseum. In the old chapter-house of this church are preserved some\r\nfragments of crosses of a remarkable character. They are of beautiful\r\ndesign, and are fully described by the Bishop of Bristol in vol.\r\nxlix. of the _British Archæological Journal_. He assigns them to the\r\npre-Norman period, and designates them as British, and prior to 903,\r\nwhen the Bréts were driven out of this part of England. In his opinion\r\nthe fragments of two beautiful sculptured shafts are as fine in their\r\nwork as any of the pre-Norman monuments left in England. Fragments of\r\ncrosses of a similar character, and probably of a similar date, are\r\nto be found at Neston, Bromborough, and West Kirby, and a portion of\r\none from Hilbre Island is now in the Grosvenor Museum at Chester. Most\r\nof these have circular wheel heads with three projections, a type of\r\ncross which (according to Mr. Romilly Allen) is common to North Wales\r\nand Cornwall, but does not appear to be known elsewhere. Some of the\r\ncrosses here mentioned, besides others elsewhere, as at Disley (now\r\nat Lyme Hall) and at Cheadle, have no doubt been sepulchral, either\r\nas headstones or flat ones. Some, however, have been _Churchyard_ or\r\n_Preaching Crosses_, and a notable instance of this is to be found in\r\nthe fragments now preserved at Bromborough. The late Mr. E. W. Cox\r\ngave a very accurate and careful description of these, and a design\r\nfor the reconstruction of the cross, which would have stood about 10\r\nfeet high. A similar one once existed at Wallasey, and is described in\r\na MS. history of that parish early in the seventeenth century. It is\r\nsaid to have been broken in three pieces by the soldiers of William\r\nIII., and afterwards used for steps to the churchyard stile. In many of\r\nour churchyards, as at Bebington and at Shocklach (and no doubt there\r\nare many other instances), the pedestals or bases of crosses are to\r\nbe seen. In the latter place the stones of the three steps have been\r\ncarefully refixed, and the stem been lengthened a foot at its lower\r\nend so that it might fit into the socket on the top base. On the top\r\nof the stem (from which, of course, the cross had been removed) are\r\nfour semi-circular holes systematically placed opposite to each other,\r\n2 to 2½ inches in diameter, and 1½ inches deep. These are not dowel or\r\ncramp holes for the affixing of a sun-dial, or for the cross itself;\r\nand it has been conjectured that marketing and other transactions\r\nwould take place here, and that when the plague was raging these holes\r\nwould be filled with vinegar, in which the coins would be placed,\r\nso as to render them free from infection. Many of our readers will\r\nthink of other examples which are left, some, it may be, in their own\r\nchurchyards, and will be able to associate with them scenes of former\r\ndays. They may picture to themselves the congregations gathered round\r\nthem listening to the monk or friar or other early preacher as he\r\nunfolded the story of which the cross was the centre and the emblem,\r\nand pressed upon his hearers the lessons it was to teach, and the\r\nimpression it was to make upon their daily lives. Then, in some cases,\r\nthese fragments which are left have preserved to us wonderful specimens\r\nof decorative treatment, interesting not merely to the archæological\r\nstudent, but also to the ordinary individual, as indications of\r\nthe art and skill and thoroughness of past generations, and thus\r\nas treasured memorials of olden days. Sometimes the _Churchyard\r\nCross_ has been restored in recent years, as at Over Peover and St.\r\nMary’s-on-the-Hill, Chester. In each case the shortened shaft had been\r\nmade the receptacle of a sun-dial. At Peover the restored cross is\r\na memorial to the late Sir Philip Mainwaring. On an octagonal shaft\r\nof Portland stone a moulded capped head has been placed, on which is\r\ncarved the figure of our Lord upon the cross with St. Mary and St. John\r\nunder a gabled canopy. The cross at St. Mary’s, Chester, is a floriated\r\none of Yorkshire stone: at the bottom of the new work is a border with\r\nfour angels, and above this architectural canopies or niches, in one of\r\nwhich is the patron saint of the church, the Blessed Virgin Mary. The\r\ncross occupies a most commanding position overlooking the river and the\r\ncity walls. Other examples will no doubt occur to many of our readers.\r\n\r\nMention must be made, though an accurate description cannot be given,\r\nof Clulow Cross, near Wincle, of the Bow Stones on Lyme Moor, of two\r\nat Ludworth, and of three in the Public Park at Macclesfield. They are\r\nsingular in their construction, the shafts being square at the top and\r\nround at the bottom. Mr. Romilly Allen has given a careful description\r\nof these, which have great antiquarian interest, but has not suggested\r\nwhat their origin may have been, though he classes them amongst early\r\nChristian monuments. Whilst they may have been memorial in the first\r\ninstance, they may afterwards have served the purpose of reading a\r\nlesson and imparting instruction to the wayfarer as he passed by, or to\r\nthe observer as he noted them from a distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Base of Old Village Cross, Eaton, near Tarporley.]\r\n\r\nOf _Market Crosses_ the county has some noteworthy examples. Some of\r\nthese are to be found in places where markets are no longer held, and\r\nthus stand out as witnesses of departed greatness. A notable instance\r\nof this is found at Bromborough, in the Wirral. Though a simple\r\nvillage, it formerly had a market on Monday, which was granted in 1277\r\nto the Abbot and Monastery of St. Warburgh, in Chester, together\r\nwith a three days’ fair at the festival of St. Barnabas, the patron\r\nsaint of the church. The market, of course, has long since ceased to\r\nbe held, but in the centre of the village the site of the Market Cross\r\nis marked by the ancient steps, eight in number, on which was erected\r\na few years ago a handsome cross. In this case it can only recall what\r\nonce has been. At Lymm (where again no market is now held) is another\r\nexample of a different kind. Here the lower steps are carved out of\r\nthe natural rock. On the top one stands, not a cross, but a stone\r\nbuilding, supported on four columns, with a gabled roof, surmounted\r\nby a knob facing each way. On the gables are sundials, which have\r\nbeen renewed, and on the top a central pinnacle with weather-cock.\r\nOn one of the lower steps are the stocks, very perfect examples of\r\nthese old-time punishment seats. The grooved uprights still remain,\r\nand the woodwork, with a double pair of holes (so that two offenders\r\nmight be in durance vile at the same time), though much chipped and\r\nbroken, is still complete. In the little hamlet of Eaton, in the parish\r\nof Tarporley, at the junction of the roads may be seen a flight of\r\nsteps, on which once evidently rested a cross, the place of which is\r\nnow occupied by a growing tree. The position seems to bring it into\r\nthe category of market crosses. Was it in humble imitation of larger\r\nplaces that village crosses were erected in the centre of the hamlet,\r\nand did they thus give their religious sanction to the business which\r\nmight be transacted beneath them, even though no markets, in the proper\r\nsense of the word, were held there? At Macclesfield, the remains of the\r\nold Market Cross now stand in the Park, where the uncomfortable town\r\nstocks of iron may also be seen. In other places in the county no doubt\r\nsimilar relics have been preserved; but it is in the Market-place of\r\nSandbach that the greatest treasures of this kind are to be seen. Of\r\nthe Sandbach crosses Ormerod has said, “They may indisputably be ranked\r\namong the finest monuments of antiquity of this kind in the kingdom.”\r\nSimilarly Mr. Romilly Allen has said, “Much of the finest series of\r\nfigure subjects probably in all England is to be seen on the mutilated\r\ncrosses at Sandbach.” The origin of the crosses is veiled in obscurity.\r\nIt has been asserted that they were put up in the year 608, when Penda\r\nreturned a Christian convert to Mercia, attended, according to Bede, by\r\nfour priests deputed to preach the gospel throughout his dominions. But\r\nthough this statement may be quite conjectural, there is no doubt that\r\nthey may be placed at a very early date. Mr. Romilly Allen thinks that\r\nthe earliest date which can be assigned to any Christian monument in\r\nCheshire is in the second half of the seventh century; so that he (no\r\nmean authority) would not accept the above statement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sandbach Crosses.]\r\n\r\nThe crosses have had a chequered history. They were broken down and\r\ndefaced in the civil wars in the reign of Charles I. The pieces were\r\nthen dispersed, and were taken possession of by different people. One\r\nof the largest was removed to Utkinton Hall, thence later to Tarporley\r\nRectory, and finally to Oulton Park, where it stood for some time near\r\nthe park wall, not far from the lodge. Other pieces had a similar\r\nexperience. Dr. Ormerod was chiefly instrumental in gathering the\r\nfragments together, one having been built into a wall near the town\r\nwell, and another used as a step of a cottage. Fortunately the stone,\r\nthough local, is of a much harder grit than the ordinary Cheshire\r\nsandstone, and in consequence the carving has not suffered to anything\r\nlike the extent it otherwise would have done by these removals and by\r\nweather. Considering the unique character of the crosses, this is a\r\nmatter of sincere congratulation. Mr. Allen suggests that they were\r\nerected “to encourage devotion in a public place by the religious\r\nsubjects sculptured on them”; and to this we might add, to urge upon\r\nall who transacted business there that their dealings should be marked\r\nby truth and justice. The two crosses stand on a substructure of two\r\nsteps, with two sockets in which the crosses are fixed. At the angle of\r\neach stage of the platform are stone posts, on which figures have been\r\nrudely carved. The crosses are now of unequal height, if ever they\r\nwere of the same dimensions. The taller one is 16 feet 8 inches high;\r\nthe shorter one 11 feet 11 inches. On the shorter cross one piece,\r\nand on the taller one two pieces, have evidently suffered somewhat\r\nwhen they were taken away, as the carving on them is less distinct\r\nthan on the rest. The following description will give some idea of the\r\nelaborate nature of the carvings, and will show that the opinion of\r\nDr. Ormerod and other experts is amply justified, and that the county,\r\nand specially the town, of Sandbach may be proud of possessing such\r\ntreasures. In the larger cross the framework, in which the figures on\r\neach side are included, divides near the base and becomes forked, and\r\nin the angles on the east side are figures of cherubs looking upwards.\r\nImmediately above this is a large circle containing three figures,\r\nrepresenting the Virgin enthroned, holding the Holy Child, with a saint\r\non either side and the Holy Dove above. In the next compartment are\r\nthree figures, and it has been suggested that they may represent the\r\nBaptism of our Lord, though it would seem to be unusual to have three\r\nfigures in such representation. The Holy Dove is again observed here\r\non the right. The longer panel above this has in the lower division\r\nthe Nativity, the ox and the ass being seen on either side of the\r\nmanger-cradle. Then there is the Crucifixion, with the sun and moon\r\nabove and the Virgin and St. John below; and surrounding this are the\r\nsymbols of the four Evangelists. On this latter point Mr. Romilly\r\nAllen remarks: “The association of the symbols of the four Evangelists\r\nwith the Crucifixion is somewhat unusual, as well as in the form of\r\nthe symbols, which resembles those on one of the crosses at Ilkley,\r\nin Yorkshire, and on a small fragment of a cross shaft at Halton, in\r\nLancashire.” Perhaps the association of the four Evangelists with the\r\nCrucifixion may be intended to emphasise the fact that that event is\r\nrecorded with much minuteness by each of them, and is thus the central\r\nfact of the gospel story. The west side of this cross is divided into\r\neight double compartments. The first part is filled by dragons and\r\nother zoomorphic designs, and in other parts representations of winged\r\nfigures. The scriptural scenes are pronounced to be the appearance of\r\nthe Angel Gabriel to Zacharias; Simon of Cyrene bearing the cross; our\r\nSaviour led bound before Pilate; Christ in glory; and St. Peter with\r\nhis keys. On the south side we find a variety of foliage, knots, and\r\nelaborate ornaments; and on the north side a number of figures, the\r\nmost conspicuous being a large fish, with tongue triply cloven. The\r\nsmaller cross bears a variety of human figures placed within niches and\r\nlozenges, with one group apparently intended to represent the Three\r\nPersons of the Blessed Trinity. There are at least three different\r\npatterns in what may be called the knot ornamentation, which may be\r\nthus described: knots derived from a three-cord plait, figure-of-eight\r\nknots, and a pattern derived from a four-cord plait. This last is one\r\nof extreme rarity in this country, there being, in Mr. Romilly Allen’s\r\nopinion, no other instance of its occurrence elsewhere. It is, however,\r\nto be found on a splendid sword of the Viking period found at Ultuna,\r\nin Sweden. Mr. Romilly Allen, commenting on the crosses, remarked that,\r\n“The way in which the designs are arranged in several different kinds\r\nof panels is worthy of notice. Some of the panels have square tops,\r\nothers round tops, others are diamond-shaped, and others triangular.\r\nThey are also in some cases placed in double rows, and are not always\r\nopposite each other. On one of the shafts the panels are shaped like a\r\nthimble, and aggregated in twos and threes in an extraordinary way.”\r\n\r\nIt will be understood from this that these monuments, whatever be their\r\norigin, are of priceless value, and offer for the student much food for\r\nreflection, and for the ordinary individual objects for admiration.\r\n\r\nIt is satisfactory to know that the local authorities at Sandbach fully\r\nappreciate these treasures. Quite recently they consulted the Council\r\nof the Chester and North Wales Archæological and Historic Society as to\r\ntheir condition, and as to whether any further steps should be taken\r\nfor their preservation. Accordingly two members of the Council with\r\nexpert knowledge visited the place, and came to the conclusion that\r\nbeyond the careful pointing of some joints nothing was necessary. They\r\nthought that a fence or barricade of any kind would interfere with the\r\nharmony of the design, and that if a careful watch was exercised to see\r\nthat no damage was done by children or mischievous persons, the crosses\r\nwould last in their present condition for generations, the nature of\r\nthe stone being hard and durable. Still more recently Sandbach has been\r\nvisited by the Cambrian Archæological Society, and as a consequence\r\nof that visit it is probable that casts or squeezes will be taken of\r\nthe designs on the crosses, and that thus a more close and careful\r\nexamination of them will be rendered possible. This may lead to the\r\nelucidation of some of the doubtful points in connection with their\r\ninterpretation, and so to the clearing up of a good deal which is at\r\npresent uncertain. At any rate, we may hope that for many generations\r\nSandbach will be known as the happy possessor and the jealous guardian\r\nof these early monuments, and that for many a long year amongst the\r\n“Memorials of Old Cheshire” will be reckoned these wonderful and unique\r\ncrosses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ECHOES FROM FARNDON\r\n\r\n  By the late Rev. L. E. Owen\r\n\r\n [The sudden death of Mr. Owen prevented him from recasting the\r\n materials he had gathered and the paper he had written. It has been\r\n a labour of love to the Archdeacon of Chester to do this, and to add\r\n some little matter bearing upon the points which Mr. Owen, with his\r\n full and sympathetic knowledge of the place, had brought into such\r\n clear prominence.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFarndon (Ferenton in Domesday Book) is a village about eight miles from\r\nChester, and small though it is, it has played no unimportant part in\r\nthe history of the county. It is situated on the banks of the Dee,\r\nimmediately opposite to Holt, in Wales, with which it is connected by a\r\nfine stone bridge of nine arches. Many people nowadays will only think\r\nof the extensive fields of strawberries for which Farndon is famous,\r\nand it will therefore be a revelation to them to learn that the village\r\nin former days was a place of some importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Farndon Bridge.]\r\n\r\nGoing back to Roman times, we must remember that Farndon was on the\r\nroad between Chester and Wroxeter, and that it commanded the ferry,\r\nthe first means of crossing the river above Chester. The importance of\r\nthis situation in that early period has recently been brought out by\r\nthe discovery of extensive Roman remains at Holt, and within half a\r\nmile of Farndon Bridge. Here cartloads of broken pottery, tiles, and\r\ndrain-pipes have been found, many of which bear the stamp of “Leg. xx.\r\nv.v.,” with that regiment’s peculiar badge of the boar. The excavations\r\nare still proceeding, and fortunately are being conducted under the\r\nsupervision of an ardent antiquarian, Mr. Arthur Acton, who is the\r\noccupier of the site. It is too soon yet to form an adequate opinion of\r\nthe bearing of this discovery on past history. That an important Roman\r\nstation existed here there can be no doubt, and it must have extended\r\nits distinction to Farndon, at the opposite side of the river. In fact,\r\nRoman tiles and portions of a hypocaust have been found at Crewe Hill,\r\nthe residence of Mr. Harry Barnston, in the parish and about a mile\r\nsouth of the village of Farndon. It has been suggested that the site at\r\nHolt may have been occupied by kilns for the manufacture of tiles and\r\npipes. The profusion in which these are found and the character of some\r\nof them are somewhat in favour of this idea. Large supplies would be\r\nneeded for the neighbouring city of Chester, and this may have been the\r\nmost convenient spot for making them. But if this were so, the factory\r\nwould no doubt be protected in some way, and the excavations which\r\nare proceeding will probably reveal something, and may clear up the\r\nmatter. In any case, Farndon would derive considerable importance from\r\nits proximity to Holt, as it was here that the river was crossed; if\r\nHolt was a camp, there would be frequent communications through Farndon\r\nbetween it and Chester; if a factory, the articles constructed would\r\nhave to be conveyed through the place in the same way. We can well\r\nimagine that in those bygone ages Farndon witnessed a considerable,\r\nif not a constant, stream of traffic between Wales and Chester. It\r\nis possible that Holt, and not Bangor-is-y-coed, may have been the\r\nsite of the Roman _Bovium_, and the late Mr. Thompson Watkins, in his\r\n_Roman Cheshire_, in 1886 wrote: “If Bovium were on this line of road,\r\nwhich I do not think, it would certainly be at Holt or Farndon, for\r\nthe distance, nine English or ten Roman miles, exactly agrees, whilst\r\nBangor is at least fifteen Roman miles from Chester.” If this were the\r\ncase, Farndon would derive considerable importance from its nearness\r\nto the place, and would in some measure be a kind of outwork and\r\nprotection to it.\r\n\r\nComing on to a later period, Farndon, from its position, must often\r\nhave been the scene of stirring events. It was, as will have been\r\ngathered, not far from Bangor Monachorum, and communications between\r\nthe two places must have been frequent. It is conceivable that the\r\nfirst Christian church was planted at Farndon, or the first preaching\r\nof Christianity given, by the monks from that monastery, but this must\r\nbe a matter of conjecture. But when Ethelfrith, the pagan King of\r\nNorthumbria, having conquered Chester, invaded Wales, A.D. 613, he must\r\nhave passed through Farndon, or been in its immediate neighbourhood.\r\nIt was then that the “Battle of Chester” was fought, and that the\r\nKing massacred 1200 monks upon the field, because, though not bearing\r\narms, they were praying for his defeat, and afterwards burnt down the\r\nmonastic buildings, murdered the remnant of the monks, and destroyed\r\ntheir libraries. Those must have been anxious times for the dwellers\r\nin Farndon. No doubt in the years that followed they were continually\r\nbeing roused to activity, and had to protect themselves from constant\r\nattacks from their neighbours, the Welsh; but all this we must imagine,\r\nfor we have no definite record of it. We are told that Edward the\r\nElder, son of King Alfred, died at Farndon in 925, on his way south\r\nfrom fighting at Chester. He was carried to Winchester and buried in\r\nthe Cathedral. The quotation from William of Malmesbury is as follows:\r\nAfter the battle at Chester “paucis diebus apud Ferenduna mortuus est\r\nEdvardus.” Some think that this refers to Farndon in Nottinghamshire,\r\nthough the wounded monarch could hardly have accomplished so long\r\na ride in a few days. The statement or tradition is an interesting\r\none, and it would be well if further confirmatory information were\r\nforthcoming. It is curious (though it may have no connection with\r\nthis event) that there was afterwards at Farndon one of the Cheshire\r\nsanctuaries called King’s Marsh. “It was a wild, desolate district,\r\nsurrounded by a ditch to mark the limit of safety for fugitives and\r\n‘foreigners’; for any who sought the protection of the Earl of Chester,\r\nor who were acting as mercenaries against his enemies, might reside\r\nhere in safety for a year and day, provided they used no nails or pins\r\nin the erection of their squatter’s tent.”[50]\r\n\r\n [50] Coward’s _Picturesque Cheshire_, p. 278. The title may perhaps\r\n be due to the fact that King Richard III. granted Over-Marsh to Sir\r\n William Stanley, the name being subsequently changed to King’s Marsh.\r\n\r\nThe bridge which succeeded the ferry has always been famous as\r\naffording connection with Wales. The next bridge below is at Aldford,\r\nsome six miles by river, and the next above at Bangor, about fourteen\r\nmiles distant by the river, which winds considerably. The date for it\r\ngiven by Pennant is 1345, and he says, “Until lately” (by which he may\r\nmean 1820 to 1830) “the date was over one of the arches,” but that has\r\nnow disappeared. It consists of nine arches, one of which is higher\r\nthan the rest; and in the roadway above this is some very massive\r\nmasonry on the north side, indicating the site of the guardhouse, under\r\nwhich was a drawbridge, used with considerable effect at the battle of\r\nFarndon Bridge, when the Parliamentarians drove the Royalists over into\r\nWales in 1643. In the Constable’s accounts for 1727 occurs the item:\r\n“Payd for the Guard House, 00. 01. 09.” The best part of the old bridge\r\nis to be seen by going into the third bay from Holt on the north side,\r\nand observing the tracery of a portion of some beautiful windows. The\r\nwestern one has remains of steps leading down to the water. Attention\r\nis directed to this, as but few visitors notice it. A sad tragedy is\r\nconnected with this bridge. Prince Madoc, son of Griffith, Lord of\r\nDinas Bran, had two sons, of whom Earl Warren and Roger Mortimer, Earl\r\nof the Marches, were appointed guardians by Edward I. These lords soon\r\nconspired to free themselves from their charges and possess themselves\r\nof their estates. Accordingly they caused them, one being of the age of\r\nten and the other eight, to be thrown over the bridge and drowned. The\r\nauthority for this story is in a manuscript in the Bodleian Library,\r\nbut for many years a variation of it was current in the country under\r\nthe fable of two young fairies who had been destroyed in this manner.\r\nThere were also legends of their ghosts being seen at certain times.\r\nIt was Roger Mortimer who, with Isabella, wife of Edward II., was\r\nresponsible for that King’s death at Berkeley Castle.\r\n\r\nThe bridge must have been the scene of many a fierce fight when the\r\nmarauding Welsh sought to cross to Farndon; sometimes also between the\r\nfactions of the two towns, for though such near neighbours, the men\r\nof Farndon and Holt were frequently at loggerheads. In the Civil War,\r\nhowever, the bridge came into great prominence. Sir William Brereton\r\nforced his passage over it into Wales in November 1643 on his way to\r\nHawarden. A few years ago letters from him bearing on the point were\r\npublished in the Reports of the Historical Manuscript Commission.\r\nThey show how the Royalists had made a tower and a drawbridge, and\r\nput strong gates on the bridge between Holt and Farndon; and these\r\nwere so strong “that they and wee conceived it verrie difficulte,\r\nif not altogether ympossible, to make way for our passage over the\r\nbridge.” However, Sir William, having by a feint drawn off some of\r\nthe Royalists, made a fierce attack on the bridge, cut the ropes of\r\nthe drawbridge, forced open the gates, and gained possession of the\r\nbridge. Many of the Royalist troops retreated to Holt Castle, which was\r\nstrongly fortified, but Sir William pushed on and captured Wrexham,\r\nand eventually, as stated in another paper in this volume, occupied\r\nHawarden Castle. Two years later the Royalist cavalry, coming from\r\nWales under the command of Sir Marmaduke Langdale, came over the bridge\r\nbefore the disastrous battle on Rowton Moor, and some few of those who\r\nescaped made use of the same way for their retreat. And during this\r\nanxious time, or at any rate a portion of it, the church at Farndon\r\nwas turned into a garrison for soldiers, and naturally suffered in\r\nconsequence. It was burnt by the Parliamentarians in 1645, and traces\r\nof this may still be seen, as also the marks of the shot and bullets\r\nwhich were discharged at it.\r\n\r\nThe church probably occupies the site of an earlier Saxon wooden\r\nbuilding. Like the church of Holt, it is dedicated to St. Chad, who\r\nis the patron saint of a great many churches in the boundaries of the\r\nold kingdom of Mercia. It stands on an eminence, and is 86 feet above\r\nthe sea-level, whilst the bridge is 12½ miles distant from the weir\r\nat Chester. The nave and pillars are late Norman of the close of the\r\ntwelfth century. Originally the nave had a sloping roof, the lines\r\nof which may be seen above the tower arch. The clerestory windows\r\nwere added at the rebuilding of the church after the fire. The tower,\r\nwhich can be seen from a considerable distance, is said to be of the\r\nthirteenth century, and the aisle windows are of the date of Charles\r\nII. Formerly there was good stained glass of an heraldic character\r\nrelating to the families of Leche of Carden and Bostock of Churton,\r\nbut this has entirely disappeared. A great treasure, however, is to\r\nbe seen in the Barnston Chapel, on the south side, where there is a\r\nsmall stained-glass window of a character almost absolutely unique.\r\nIt contains coloured figures of the four loyal Royalist families\r\nwho fought for King Charles I. The first top light has gone, but on\r\nthe plain glass is the inscription: “This window being ruinated was\r\nrepaired by Dean Cholmondeley.” In the second light we have Sir William\r\nMainwaring; in the third, Sir Thomas (or Sir Roger) Grosvenor; and in\r\nthe fourth, Captain William Barnston. In the centre is a representation\r\nof Sir Francis Gamul (bearing the badge of baronetcy) of Chester, with\r\nwhom King Charles witnessed the defeat of his army on Rowton Moor. In\r\nthe lowest light is a picture of Mr. Barrington of Chester, who is\r\ncarrying an ensign most gracefully. The glass is most interesting,\r\nand the details of the various panels are very full, the coats of\r\narms of the various officers being given, and thus leading to their\r\nidentification. The great gun or arquebus should be noted, with its\r\nsupport or carrier looking like a pitchfork. Large pikes and helmets\r\nlike those depicted are preserved at Crewe Hill, the residence of\r\nMr. Harry Barnston. The glass has been carefully protected, under the\r\nadvice of Messrs. Powell, and Mr. Barnston has written a description,\r\nwhich is placed underneath. The window may probably be dated soon after\r\nthe Restoration. The Barnston family have resided in the parish since\r\n1370.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the church is the ancient stone effigy of a knight\r\nin armour. The probable date of this is 1346. On his shield is written\r\nin Lombardic letters: “Hic jacet Patricius de Barton. Orate pro eo.”\r\nBarton, it may be remarked, is one of the townships of Farndon. He is\r\nsemi-plated with chain armour and surcoat. The arms or distinctions on\r\nthe shield are: “Argent, a bend cotised.” At his feet are two animals,\r\na dog and a scaly animal, various interpretations being given of them,\r\nbut none so far satisfactory.[51] The face of the knight was probably\r\ndisfigured when the church was used as barracks. There were two other\r\nstone effigies in the church, but they were broken up about 1780 to\r\nmend the paths! One is said to have been a monument to Madocus, a\r\nprince in Wales, already alluded to.\r\n\r\n [51] Lysons describes them thus: “On one of the shields a lion rampant,\r\n and on another a wolf passant regardant (the coat of Daresbury).”\r\n\r\nThe overseers’ and wardens’ books give many interesting particulars\r\nbearing upon the state of affairs at the time of the Civil War. Many\r\nof these were published in _The Cheshire Sheaf_ in 1884. The following\r\nwill give some indication of their character: “1644. To the Constable\r\nfor the Treaned (_trained_) Souldier for tow months’ pay for the loar\r\n(_lower?_) house, xviiij_d._” “1644, 20 Jan. Payd to Crestlendon\r\n(_Christleton_) to the garrison there, x_d._” “1644, 21 ffebruary.\r\nRichard Oakes took three measures of malt to ffarndon sege, and the 7th\r\nof this month a lofe of bread 14 lb.” The experience of these anxious\r\ndays no doubt led the parochial authorities to the conclusion that\r\npermanent arrangements should be made for the protection of the place\r\nand district. After the raising of the siege of Chester we find this\r\nentry: “1646, 28 May. Payd to Thos. Moltra, constable, 2 mises, one for\r\nthe building of a munt (_mount_) in the view of the Castle of the Holt\r\nfor to keep them better in, the other, &c.” This building of a mount is\r\nmost interesting. There is still a place called “The Mount Field” on\r\nthe Farndon side of the river, nearly opposite Holt Castle. Upon this\r\nspot in 1646 cannon were placed, and cannon-balls have been found in\r\nthe field. Many other entries from these carefully preserved records\r\nand from the registers might be given, but these must suffice to show\r\nthe importance of Farndon, which must from the earliest times have been\r\na commanding position, and thus have filled no mean place in the annals\r\nof the history of the county and the country at large.\r\n\r\nIt will not be out of place to mention here that Farndon is one of the\r\nparishes which keep up a _Rush-bearing Sunday_. Of course this does not\r\nimply, as in olden days, the strewing of the church with fresh rushes,\r\nwhich was done for the comfort of the worshippers. At stated times,\r\nand generally at the time of the patronal feast of a church, the old\r\nrushes were cleared away and new ones carried in, and this was done\r\nwith due solemnity, and the occasion made into a parochial festival.\r\nNow at Farndon, Shocklach, and some other places, the graves are decked\r\nwith rushes and flowers, and thus the memory of departed friends is\r\ncherished, whilst it is a time for reunion of families, and distant\r\nmembers revisit their homes.\r\n\r\nWe can give no account, not even traditional, of the prowess of Patrick\r\nde Barton and the other knights whose effigies have been mentioned.\r\nThey probably would have been worth recording if this had been\r\npossible. But Farndon can, at any rate, boast of some distinguished\r\nnatives. The Barnston Chapel in the church cannot but remind us of\r\nsome, and specially Wm. Barnston, portrayed in the window there.\r\nHe died 6th March 1664, and on the tablet to his memory he is thus\r\ndescribed: “He was a person of great worth and integrity, ventured\r\nhis life and fortune with King Charles the First; was sent prisoner\r\nfrom Oxford to London, where he continued till he paid his composition\r\nfor his estate.” In later years a member of the same family, Roger\r\nBarnston, distinguished himself in the Crimea and in the Indian Mutiny,\r\ndying of his wounds at Cawnpore; and his deeds are commemorated by a\r\ntall stone obelisk by the side of the road in the parish. But Farndon\r\nhas produced one distinguished man of peace at least besides these\r\nstrenuous soldiers. John Speed, generally known as the historian, was\r\nborn here in 1552. He was a tailor by trade, and migrated first to\r\nWrexham and then to London. Here, “under the favour of the Company of\r\nMerchant Taylors, he was rescued from his menial employment.” He must,\r\nof course, have shown some aptitude for study to have attracted this\r\nnotice. His opportunities at Farndon cannot have been great, as the\r\nschool there was only founded in the year of his death. In passing we\r\nmay note that this place produced another antiquary in the person of\r\nDr. Williamson, who was born at Chilton, a township of this parish, and\r\nwhose manuscript history of the Cheshire manors (_Villare Cestriense_)\r\nhas been of much use to subsequent writers. Speed apparently rose to\r\nhigh office in the company, which had just shown its warm interest\r\nin education by establishing in 1561 the Merchant Taylors’ School,\r\nwhich has proved such a valuable institution. Queen Elizabeth had two\r\nfavourite antiquarians--one was Sir John Camden and the other John\r\nSpeed. The former of these is no doubt the more famous of the two, and\r\nhis researches have been of great benefit to subsequent historians,\r\nwhilst his name is perpetuated in the title of one of the History\r\nProfessorships at Oxford. But Speed did very good work and has left\r\nbehind him a great deal that is valuable in his stupendous volumes,\r\n_The History of Great Britain_. Hulbert, in his _Cheshire Antiquities_\r\n(1828), states that “he has often been denominated the Elucidator of\r\nthe Biography and History of Great Britain.” Had he had the advantages\r\nof a liberal education he would probably have been as eminent a scholar\r\nas his patrons, Sir Fulke Greville and Sir Robert Cotton. By the\r\ngenerous assistance of the former of these he was enabled to withdraw\r\nfrom the drudgery of business, and to devote himself to his favourite\r\npursuit, the study of history. How Speed became known to him we do\r\nnot know, but that great patron of learning (afterwards Lord Brooke,\r\nwho was assassinated in 1628) had the discernment to discover and the\r\ngenerosity to encourage talent and genius, however humble in rank or\r\nobscure in birth. John Speed must have become acquainted with the\r\nliterary men of his time, as Bacon, Shakespeare, Raleigh, Spenser, and\r\nothers, and from his association with them must have learnt a great\r\ndeal and have acquired that taste which stood him in good stead in the\r\ngathering of information. When his origin and early years are taken\r\ninto account, he stands out as a wonderful example of the acquisition\r\nof knowledge under difficulties, and so of patience and perseverance\r\nin endeavouring to overcome them. He must have been gifted with great\r\nnatural talents, and he certainly made a good use of them. He was a\r\nnotable map-maker, and that at a time when such art must have been rare\r\nand hard to acquire. Many old books of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies contain maps drawn by him, and these generally were\r\nembellished with certain artistic accessories, and were not confined\r\nto mere outlines and names. Thus “the ground plan of Chester” has also\r\na view of Chester from the south-west side, the arms of the seven\r\nEarls and eight Barons of Chester, and the arms of the city, as also a\r\nreduced “mapp of Cheshire.” Similarly the map of “the Countye Palatine\r\nof Chester” has also a plan “of that most ancient citye,” the arms of\r\nthe Earls, and of Speed and his assistant. In the body of the map are\r\ntrees, hills, windmills, and churches, whilst ships and fishes (of a\r\nwonderful order) are to be seen in the estuary. An angel is depicted\r\nwith one hand on a globe on a table, and the other holding a shield\r\non which are Speed’s coat of arms, and underneath the inscription:\r\n“Performed by John Speed assisted by William Smyth. And are to be solde\r\nby Roger Rea the Elder and younger at the Golden Crosse in Cornhill\r\nagainst the Exchange.” It will be gathered from this that in the\r\nproduction of his works Speed must have taken the greatest pains, and\r\nthat he was not content with merely following the ordinary lines. The\r\nfollowing quotation from the 37th chapter of his book, dealing with the\r\nCounty Palatine of Chester, may be interesting as showing the style in\r\nwhich he wrote: “If the affection to my natural producer blind not the\r\njudgement of this my Survey; for aire and soil it equalls the best,\r\nand farre exceeds her neighbours the next Counties: for although the\r\nClimate be cold, and toucheth the degree of Latitude 54, yet the warmth\r\nfrom the _Irish Seas_ melteth the Snow, and dissolveth the Ice sooner\r\nthere than in those parts that are farther off; and so wholesome for\r\nlife that the inhabitants generally attain to many years. The soil is\r\nfat, fruitfull, and rich, yielding abundantly both profit and pleasures\r\nof man. The Champion grounds make glad the hearts of their Tillers;\r\nthe Medows imbroidered with divers sweet-smelling flowers; and the\r\nPastures make the Kine’s udders to strout to the Paile, from whom and\r\nwherein the best Cheese of all Europe is made.” No apology can be\r\nnecessary for giving this opinion of his native county in _Memorials\r\nof Old Cheshire_, as it shows the estimation in which he held it three\r\nhundred years ago. Speed did not forget his old home and the church\r\nwhere he was baptized, for he presented a silver chalice to the church.\r\nUnfortunately this has disappeared, and one of the chalices now in use\r\nbears the inscription: “This Cup was given in exchange for one given\r\nto Farndon Church by John Speed.” The assassination of his patron,\r\nLord Brooke, in September 1628, and the death about the same time of\r\nhis wife, with whom he had spent fifty-seven years of his life, made a\r\ngreat impression upon Speed, and he died 28th July 1629, and was buried\r\nin St. Giles’ Church, Cripplegate, where a monument was erected to his\r\nmemory, on which was inscribed: “Civis Londinensis mercatorum scissorum\r\nfratris servi fidelissimi regiarum majestatum Elizabethæ, Jacobi, and\r\nCaroli nunc superstitis.” His portrait is in the National Portrait\r\nGallery. He published his _Theatre of the Empire of Great Britain_ in\r\n1606, accompanied with the first set of maps ever published in England.\r\nHis _History of Great Britain_ appeared in 1644 after his death, and\r\nbeneath the plate of his portrait is a long Latin inscription, of which\r\na portion is given above. In this he is described as a “Geographer of\r\nour lands, a faithful historian of the antiquity of Britain, and a most\r\nelegant delineator of sacred genealogy.” This last is an allusion to\r\nan elaborate work of his entitled, _The Cloud of Witnesses; or, The\r\nGenealogies of Scripture confirming the truth of the Sacred History,\r\n&c._\r\n\r\nFarndon and the county of Cheshire may well be proud of her son, who\r\n(to use Mr. Hulbert’s words) “by his character, talents, industry, and\r\nperseverance gained friends among the most distinguished individuals\r\nin the kingdom for learning and transcendent abilities; and who was a\r\nman of genuine enlightened piety, and made his talents and his studies\r\nsubservient to the cause of virtue and true religion.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Facsimile of Speed’s Autograph]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  SOME CHESHIRE CUSTOMS, PROVERBS, AND FOLK-LORE\r\n\r\n  By Joseph C. Bridge, M.A., Mus. Doc. Oxon. et Dunelm., F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheshire, although it borders on Wales, has caught but little of the\r\nCeltic imagination; and it is remarkable that the only Celtic legend\r\ncurrent is found on the northern side of the county. The folk-lore of\r\nthis County Palatine cannot compare with the quantity and quality of\r\nthe Shropshire folk-lore; but legends are to a great extent born of\r\nvalley and hill and stream, and Cheshire, with its vast plain, is, with\r\nthe exception of the river Dee, deficient in those material phenomena\r\nwhich are present in such profusion in the neighbouring border county.\r\n\r\nBut Michael Drayton says of Cheshire men that “they of all England most\r\nto antient customs cleave”; and an attempt will be made in this chapter\r\nto give a general and compressed account of the customs which still\r\nexist and of folk-lore which has been, and still is, of great interest.\r\nThe legends connected with the river Dee, and the many fine old customs\r\nconnected with Chester itself are omitted, as they can easily be read\r\nin every history of the city. For other omissions the want of space\r\nmust plead excuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOULING\r\n\r\nThe most curious Cheshire custom still existent, and one which has\r\nnot attracted the attention it deserves, is called “souling.” The day\r\nafter All Saints’ Day (now November 1st) is All Souls’ Day. This was\r\nestablished as a festival of the Church about the tenth century, and\r\nin the Middle Ages it was customary for persons dressed in black to\r\ntraverse the streets, ringing a bell at every corner and calling on all\r\nto join in prayer for the souls in Purgatory, and to contribute towards\r\nthe paying of masses for them. After the Reformation the demand for\r\nmoney was transformed into demands for liquid and solid refreshment by\r\nthe “soulers.”\r\n\r\nBut at Salerno, we are told that a custom prevailed previous to the\r\nfifteenth century of providing in every home on the eve of All Souls’\r\nDay, a sumptuous entertainment for souls in Purgatory, who are supposed\r\nto revisit temporarily the scene of their earthly labours. Every one\r\nleft their house and remained in church all night, while the feast\r\nwas consumed by thieves who made a harvest out of this pious custom.\r\nSuch is the origin of our “souling,” and it seems probable, therefore,\r\nthat “soul-cakes” were not, at first, meant for consumption by the\r\n“soulers” themselves. The custom is still observed, and on the eve of\r\nAll Souls’ (_i.e._ on the night of All Saints’ Day) bodies of children\r\nstill parade Chester and Cheshire villages singing a portion of the old\r\nsouling song, but tacked on to debased and incorrect versions of the\r\nold words, and in many cases amounting to mere doggerel.[52]\r\n\r\nNow, the melody sung is most interesting, for it is undoubtedly\r\npre-Reformation and is cast in the style of the Church music of the\r\nperiod, for there was no sharp dividing line between secular and sacred\r\nmusic when “souling” first began.[53] The “punctum” or drop of a fifth\r\nis very characteristic, and will be found in Merbecke and Church\r\nwriters of the period.\r\n\r\n [52] _e.g._ Instead of “Soul, soul, for an apple or two,” I have heard\r\n them sing, “Sole, sole, sole of my shoe”!\r\n\r\n [53] I heard a comic song sung by a rustic in Sussex a few years ago to\r\n the plain-song which is used for the hymn “O come! O come! Emmanuel,”\r\n in _Hymns Ancient and Modern_.\r\n\r\nThe following is the tune as taken down by me many times in the past\r\nthirty years, though it is now getting greatly corrupted and altered,\r\nand will probably soon die out. No accompaniment is used:--\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\n    Souling night has come at last,\r\n    And we are souling here;\r\n    And all that we are souling for,\r\n    Is apples and good cheer.\r\n\r\n      Soul, soul for an apple or two,\r\n      If you’ve no apples, pears will do;\r\n      If you’ve no pears, a good jug of beer\r\n      Will last us all till this time next year.\r\n\r\n    God bless the master of this house,\r\n    God bless the mistress too;\r\n    And all the little children that\r\n    Around the table go.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOther verses are:--\r\n\r\n    Likewise you men and maidens,\r\n    Your cattle and your store,\r\n    And all that dwells within your gates,\r\n    We wish you ten times more.\r\n\r\n    The lanes are very dirty,\r\n    My shoes are very thin;\r\n    I have a little pocket,\r\n    To put a penny in.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the “refrain”[54] practically consists of only\r\ntwo notes, so that it could easily be lengthened at the will of the\r\nsinger and new lines inserted. Here are some of the oldest rimes to\r\nwhich it is sung:--\r\n\r\n    Soul! Soul! for a soul-cake,\r\n    Pray, good missis! a soul-cake,\r\n    An apple, a pear, a plum or a cherry,\r\n    Or any good thing to make us merry--\r\n    One for Peter, two for Paul,\r\n    And three for Him who made us all.\r\n\r\n    Up with the kettle and down with the pan\r\n    Give us { an answer   } and we’ll be gone.[55]\r\n            { our souling }\r\n\r\n [54] Mr. Fuller-Maitland gives this as the tune in _English County\r\n Songs_, p. 30. This is a mistake: he only has the “refrain.”\r\n\r\n [55] There is always an “up” and “down” in all the versions met with,\r\n but, as pointed out in _Shropshire Folk-Lore_, the original no doubt\r\n was:--\r\n\r\n    “Up with the ladder and down with the can,”\r\n\r\n _i.e._ the ladder is to be raised to the apple-loft and the can taken\r\n down in the cellar for ale or cider.\r\n\r\nThe following Staffordshire version is valuable for the statement that\r\nthey “have all been praying for the soul departed.”\r\n\r\n    “Soul day, soul day,\r\n    We be come a-souling;\r\n    Pray, good people, remember the poor,\r\n    And give us all a soul-cake.\r\n    Soul day, soul day, soul,\r\n    One for Peter, two for Paul,\r\n    Three for Him who made us all.\r\n    An apple, a pear, a plum, or a cherry,\r\n    Or any good thing to make us merry.\r\n    Soul day, soul day,\r\n    We have all been praying\r\n    For the soul departed:\r\n    So pray, good people, give us a cake,\r\n    For we are all poor people,\r\n    Well known to you before;\r\n    So give us a cake, for charity’s sake,\r\n    And our blessing we’ll leave at your door.\r\n    Soul! soul! for an apple or two,\r\n    If you have no apples, pears will do;\r\n    If pears are scarce, then cakes from your pan,\r\n    Give us our souling, and we’ll be gone.”[56]\r\n\r\n [56] _The Customs, Superstitions and Legends of the County of\r\n Stafford_, by C. H. Poole, p. 34.\r\n\r\nThe following is a Lancashire reference:--\r\n\r\n “There is a singular custom still kept up at Great Marton in the Fylde\r\n district on this day. In some places it is called ‘soul-caking,’ but\r\n there it is named ‘psalm-caking’--from their reciting psalms for which\r\n they receive cakes. The custom is changing its character also--for in\r\n place of collecting cakes from house to house, as in the old time,\r\n they now beg for money. The term ‘psalm’ is evidently a corruption of\r\n the old word ‘Sal,’ for soul; the mass or requiem for the dead was\r\n called ‘Sal-mass,’ as late as the reign of Henry VI.”[57]\r\n\r\n [57] _Lancashire Folk-Lore_, p. 251, by Harland and Wilkinson.\r\n\r\nAs time went on this tune was probably considered dull and\r\nold-fashioned, and the following has, to a limited extent, supplanted\r\nit. It is evidently an adaptation of a “pace-egging” song (see\r\n_post_):--\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\n    We are one, two, three hearty lads, and we’re all of one mind,\r\n    We have come here a-souling, good nature to find;\r\n    We have come here a-souling as it doth appear,\r\n    And it’s all that we are souling for is your ale and strong beer.\r\n]\r\n\r\n        _There are two other Verses._\r\n\r\nAt Northwich, Tarporley, and other places the soulers are accompanied\r\nby one bearing an imitation head of a horse, which snaps its jaws in\r\nan alarming manner. Thus “souling” has got grafted on to the pagan\r\ncustom of “hodening.” At Over the soulers blacken their faces. This is\r\na survival of the wearing of _black_ already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe “Soulers’ Song,” as given by Egerton Leigh, is a poor modern\r\nversion, evidently adapted from a _Maying_ song:--\r\n\r\n    “Ye gentlemen of England I could have ye draw near\r\n       To these few lines which we have wrote,\r\n         And all ye soon shall hear\r\n     Sweet melody of music all on this evening clear,\r\n     For we are gone a-souling for apples and strong beer.”\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth series of rimes on the subject, and the constant\r\ndemand for apples and ale was to make a “wassail” bowl of “lambswool,”\r\nor hot spiced ale, with toast and roasted apples in it.\r\n\r\nSouling seems to have been confined to, or at all events to have only\r\nsurvived, in the counties of Cheshire and Shropshire, though why this\r\nshould be so it is difficult to say. It is also met with in the\r\nadjacent counties of Staffordshire and Lancashire, but only because it\r\nseems to have drifted over the borders. One curious reference to it\r\noccurs in _Tales and Traditions of Tenby_:[58]--\r\n\r\n “What was called ‘souling,’ or ‘sowling,’ was practised by the female\r\n portion of the poor, who visited their wealthier neighbours, demanding\r\n ‘soul’ (possibly from the French _soûl_, signifying ‘one’s fill,’\r\n or from _saouler_, ‘to satisfy with food.’ See Wright’s _Provincial\r\n Dictionary_), which signified, in its provincial acceptation, any\r\n condiment eaten with bread, such as meat, fish, etc., but especially\r\n _cheese_. As the usage was very generally recognised, souling-day\r\n proved, and still proves, one of the most profitable days in the\r\n calendar.”\r\n\r\n [58] Published by R. Mason, Tenby, 1858, p. 17.\r\n\r\nThe fanciful derivation of “souling” may be passed by, but it is hard\r\nto account for this reference to it in “little England beyond Wales.”\r\n\r\nAt Oswestry, on the Welsh border, it is customary to begin with:--\r\n\r\n    “Wissal, wassal, bread and possel,\r\n     Cwrw da, plas yma,[59]\r\n     Apple or a pear, plum or a cherry,\r\n     Any good thing that will make us merry.”\r\n\r\n                             --_Bye-gones_, December 11, 1872.\r\n\r\n [59] _i.e._ “good ale (in) this place.”\r\n\r\nAubrey wrote regarding Shropshire thus:--\r\n\r\n “In Salop the die õnium Animarum (All Soules-day, Novemb. 2d) there is\r\n sett on the Board a high heap of soule-cakes lyeing one upon another\r\n like the picture of the Sew-bread in the old Bibles. They are about\r\n the bignesse of 2d cakes, and n’ly all the visitors that day takes\r\n one; and there is an old Rhythm or saying--\r\n\r\n    ‘A soule-cake, a soule-cake,\r\n     Have mercy on all Christian soules for a soule-cake.’”\r\n\r\n “The late Mrs. Gill, of Hopton, near Hodnet, had _soul-cakes_ made in\r\n her house to give away to souling children every year up to her death\r\n in 1884. They were flat round, (or sometimes oval) cakes, made of very\r\n light dough, spiced and sweetened.”[60]\r\n\r\n [60] Burne-Jackson’s _Shropshire Folk-Lore_, p. 382 _et seq._ Mr. Wirt\r\n Sykes, in his _British Goblins_, quotes this, and also the information\r\n about Tenby, but adds nothing to our knowledge.\r\n\r\nWe find some of the words of the “Souling Song” in nearly every\r\nitinerant begging custom. In Montgomeryshire a New Year’s rhyme is:--\r\n\r\n    “The road is very dirty,\r\n     My shoes are very thin;\r\n     Please give me a penny\r\n     To put some nails in.”\r\n\r\nSeveral of the verses are found in a “Wessel-cup Hymn”--a carol popular\r\nin Shropshire thirty years ago--and in customs in Worcestershire and\r\nYorkshire.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARLING\r\n\r\nThe traveller cannot fail to notice the large number of square pits in\r\nthe green fields of Cheshire, which are very different from the round\r\ndrinking ponds of the southern shires.\r\n\r\nThese “pits” are excavations from which marl has been dug to place on\r\nthe surface of the surrounding land as manure, and some curious old\r\ncustoms and words are connected with “marling.” After breakfast on the\r\npit bank, the “head man,” who was termed the “Lord of the soil,” called\r\nout in a loud voice three times:\r\n\r\n “‘O! Yez! O! Yez! O! Yez! This is to give notice that Mr. ---- has\r\n given to us Marlers part of a thousand pounds, and to whomsoever\r\n will do the same we will return thanks and shout.’ The men then\r\n joined hands, and, putting their heads together, shouted ‘Largesse!\r\n Largesse!’”\r\n\r\nShould any one pass through the field, the “Lord” walked up, having a\r\nmarl clod on his shoulder. This was so well understood that sixpence or\r\na shilling was usually given. If the former, it was proclaimed as “part\r\nof one hundred pounds”; if the latter, “part of one thousand pounds.”\r\nAt the close of the season they assembled in front of the village inn,\r\nand repeated the oration.\r\n\r\n“Ladling and slutching” is the clearing out the water and mud from a\r\npit. “Fea” is the soil covering the marl. “Setting” is spreading the\r\nmarl over the land; “Mid-feather,” the space between the pits.\r\n\r\nThe Cheshire rhyme says:\r\n\r\n    “He that marls sand may buy the land,\r\n     He that marls moss shall have no loss,\r\n     He that marls clay flings all away.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSH-BEARING\r\n\r\nThe strewing of the floors with rushes is an old custom, and has died\r\nhard. The farmhouses in Cheshire were strewn on the first of May with\r\ngreen rushes, over which lavender and rosemary were scattered. Rushes\r\nare no longer used, but a pattern is frequently worked on the flagged\r\nfloor by the juice of dock leaves.[61]\r\n\r\nFormerly all churches were strewn with rushes, and these were generally\r\nrenewed on great festivals:\r\n\r\n  “1551   Rysshes at Wytsontyd                           vi^d\r\n     ”    ”       ”  Mydsomer                          viij^d\r\n     ”    ” against All Hallowtyde                        x^d\r\n\r\n   1584   To Edward Griffith for boughs, rishes,\r\n            and other things what time the\r\n            Earl of Leicester came hither        xviij^s ij^d”[62]\r\n\r\n  “1630   Paid to Robert Raborne for getting\r\n            out the old rushes of the church           viij^d”[63]\r\n\r\nThe custom of carrying rushes to church gradually developed into a\r\nfestival, and the rushes were then decorated and carried in procession.\r\nIn some parishes, where the time of year was suitable, this was done on\r\nthe “Wake” day of the village. Flowers and garlands were added, which\r\n“were hung up in the church; we saw these garlands remaining in several\r\nplaces.”[64] Finally, the graves were strewn with them. This custom is\r\nstill observed at Farndon with much ceremony on July 16th or the first\r\nSunday afterwards.\r\n\r\n [61] Utkinton Hall, 1908.\r\n\r\n [62] Chester Cathedral Treasurer’s Accounts.\r\n\r\n [63] Frodsham Accounts.\r\n\r\n [64] Lyson’s _Cheshire_.\r\n\r\nMany rush-bearings, or “rush-buryings,” as they are sometimes called,\r\nbecame riotous festivities, and the _Chester Courant_ for August 6,\r\n1810, says:\r\n\r\n “Christleton Rush-Bearing.--We were sorry to learn that the\r\n festivities of this annual _fête_ should have been disgraced by that\r\n almost universally reprobated amusement, a Bull-bait. After this\r\n savage practice has fallen into disrepute and disgrace amongst the\r\n most uncultivated parts of the island, it is mortifying for us to\r\n record a transaction so disgraceful in the immediate vicinity of the\r\n polished city of Chester.”\r\n\r\nIn Cheshire also rushes are used as a charm for warts. The charmer has\r\na long straight rush, ties three knots in it, makes it into a circle,\r\ndraws it over the wart downwards nine times, at the same time muttering\r\na spell which he refuses to disclose on the ground that if he did so\r\nthe charm would not work. In three months the wart will disappear.\r\n\r\nThe old rush-lights of Cheshire were sold at twenty for sixpence. “They\r\nwere as thick as the present ‘twelve’ candles (twelve to the pound),\r\nbut half as long again, and gave a steady but dim light. There were\r\nsome curious bits of folk-lore connected with them. For instance, if\r\na rush-light in ‘sweating’ curled over, it denoted death; if a bright\r\nstar appeared in the flame, it portended a letter.”[65]\r\n\r\n [65] Burton, _Rush-Bearing_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACE-EGGING\r\n\r\nThis is still practised in the Wirral peninsula, and the rime sung by\r\nthe children was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    “Please, Mr. Whiteleg,\r\n     Please give us an Easter egg;\r\n     If you do not give us one,\r\n     Your hen shall lay an addled one,\r\n     Your cock shall lay a stone.”\r\n\r\nSometimes with the addition from “Souling” of:\r\n\r\n    “One for Peter, two for Paul,\r\n     And three for the One who made us all.”\r\n\r\n “In Birkenhead, for some years after the Park was laid out, there were\r\n several grassy mounds inside the railings ... which went by the name\r\n of ‘The Bouks’ (Banks).... Every Easter Monday the children would\r\n bring baskets of coloured eggs. Then a game was played. First, wickets\r\n were fixed at intervals at the foot of the ‘Bouks,’ the children took\r\n their eggs to the top of the hills and rolled them down, aiming to\r\n pass them unbroken through the wickets.”[66]\r\n\r\n [66] Gamlin’s _Memories of Birkenhead_.\r\n\r\nBy degrees “Pace-Egging” became grafted on to the old mumming play\r\nwhich is found in nearly every county of England, and the following was\r\nsung at Thurstaston some thirty years ago. Two verses are omitted:--\r\n\r\n        I.\r\n\r\n    Here come four or five hearty lads all of one mind;\r\n    We have come a’paste-egging if you will prove kind;\r\n    If you will prove kind, and never will fail,\r\n    We’ll treat our young lasses to the best of X ale.\r\n        Fol di-diddle dol-di-day.\r\n\r\n        II.\r\n\r\n    The next that steps in is Lord Nelson, you see\r\n    With a bunch of blue ribands tied on to his knee,\r\n    With a star on his breast like silver do shew,\r\n    And he comes a’paste-egging with his jolly crew.\r\n        Fol di-diddle dol-di-day.\r\n\r\n        IV.\r\n\r\n    The next that steps in is a lady so gay,\r\n    Who from her own country has run far away,\r\n    With the red cap and feathers that look very fine,\r\n    And all her delight is in drinking red wine.\r\n        Fol di-diddle dol-di-day.\r\n\r\n        VI.\r\n\r\n    The Master and Mistress that sit by the fire,\r\n    Put your hand in your pocket, that’s all we desire;\r\n    Put your hand in your pocket, and pull out your purse,\r\n    And give us a trifle--you’ll ne’er be any worse.\r\n        Fol di-diddle dol-di-day.\r\n\r\n        VII.\r\n\r\n    Some eggs and strong bacon we’ll never deny,\r\n    For the eggs we can suck while the bacon doth fry.\r\n    Now all ye young lasses, just mind what ye are about,\r\n    If you give nought, we’ll take nought, so we’ll bid you good night.\r\n        Fol di-diddle dol-di-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYING\r\n\r\nThe “Mayers” went about singing and soliciting alms for some weeks\r\nbefore the first of May. The following is a portion of one of their\r\nsongs, and a variant may be found in Halliwell’s _Palatine Anthology_,\r\nwhich was given to him by Ormerod, the Cheshire historian. The tune\r\ntaken down by Egerton Leigh, and given in his book of poems, is\r\nterribly mutilated, but I have reconstructed it by the aid of a very\r\nsimilar Lancashire tune. It is undoubtedly old, and the commencement\r\non the supertonic is very quaint. The words are distinctly above the\r\naverage of old ballads:\r\n\r\n[Music: CHESHIRE MAYING SONG]\r\n\r\nCHESHIRE MAY SONG\r\n\r\n        I\r\n\r\n    All on this pleasant evening together come are we,\r\n      For the summer springs so fresh, green, and gay,\r\n    To tell you of a blossom that buds on every tree,\r\n      Drawing near to the merry month of May.\r\n\r\n        II\r\n\r\n    Rise up, the master of this house, all in your chain of gold,\r\n      For the summer springs so fresh, green, and gay;\r\n    We hope you’re not offended, this night we make so bold,\r\n      Drawing near the pleasant month of May.\r\n\r\n        III\r\n\r\n    Oh! rise, the mistress of this house, with gold upon your breast,\r\n      For the summer springs so fresh, green, and gay;\r\n    And if your body be asleep, we hope your soul’s at rest,\r\n      Drawing near to the merry month of May.\r\n\r\n        &c.   &c.\r\n\r\nIn the Halliwell-Phillipps’ version each verse ends with\r\n\r\n    “Oh this is pleasant singing,\r\n     Sweet May flower is springing,\r\n     And summer comes so fresh, green, and gay.”\r\n\r\nIn Chester and surrounding villages the children still carry round May\r\ngarlands, and generally a small child bedecked with ribbons, but the\r\nold May songs are no longer used.\r\n\r\nAt Knutsford a May Queen is annually chosen and crowned in public.\r\nThis village has many curious and pretty customs. On the occasion of\r\na marriage there, brown sand was strewn in the streets, and on this,\r\nfanciful figures of white sand and sometimes the flowers of the season\r\nwere added.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFTING\r\n\r\nHone says that the custom of _Lifting_ was prevalent in Chester, but\r\nthat instead of being tossed in the air, the victims were swung about\r\nin a chair.\r\n\r\nHowever, a correspondent in Adams’ _Weekly Courant_ (printed in\r\nChester, 26th March 1771) complains strongly of the custom of\r\n“_Lifting_, or rather the assembling in a riotous manner of a\r\nconsiderable number (I am sorry to say) of females at all the gates and\r\nother thoroughfares of this city to extort money from every man whose\r\nbusiness may oblige him to pass that way. This is justly complained\r\nof by travellers, who, unacquainted with such customs (it not being\r\nsuffered in any city but this) have given a considerable sum for leave\r\nto pursue their journey, and have scarce rode to the other end of\r\nthe city but must again purchase the liberty of passing on.” It was\r\npractised at Chester up to about the year 1860.\r\n\r\nThe custom is supposed to have reference to the Ascension of our Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVEST HOME\r\n\r\nWhen the last field of corn was cut, then the farmer had what was\r\ncalled a “shutting.” The reapers would stand in a ring on some high\r\nground, and one, acting as spokesman, gave out the “nominy”:--\r\n\r\n    “Oh, yes! oh, yes! oh, yes! this is to give notice\r\n     That Mester ’Olland has gen th’ seck a turn\r\n     And sent th’ owd hare into Mester Sincop’s standin’ curn.”\r\n\r\nThen, taking hands, they all bent down and uttered an unearthly “Wow!\r\nwow-w! wow-w!” Other “nominies” followed, and then a liberal allowance\r\nof beer went round. This was supplemented by another ceremony. The last\r\nstalks of grain were plaited and formed into a threefold strand, at\r\nwhich the reapers threw their sickles. The one whose aim cut it down\r\nwas the winner. This was called “cutting the Neck.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNAGE\r\n\r\nCheshire has the great distinction of possessing two Forest Charter\r\nHorns held by cornage tenure, and these are still in existence.\r\n\r\n_The Wirral Horn._--The Hundred of Wirral was mainly divided between\r\nthe Church and the Palatinate barons. The latter not being resident,\r\nthe natives were lawless and turbulent; added to which the district was\r\nspecially liable to incursions from sea-rovers. To reduce the natives\r\nto obedience, and as a matter of precaution, Ranulph de Meschines,\r\nthe third Earl of Chester, about 1121, destroyed such boundaries of\r\nproperty as existed and planted the whole as a forest, so that “From\r\nBlacon Point to Hilbre a squirrel might jump from tree to tree”; as the\r\nold Cheshire rhyme has it.\r\n\r\nThe office of chief forester he bestowed upon Alan Sylvester, together\r\nwith the manors of Storeton and Puddington, to be held by the tenure\r\nof blowing a horn, or causing it to be blown, at the “Gloverstone,”\r\nChester, on the morning of every fair-day, to indicate that the tolls\r\npayable on all goods bought or sold in the city, or within sound of\r\nthat horn, during the fair, belonged to the Earl and his tenants there.\r\n\r\nAfter 250 years the citizens of Chester found the forest and its\r\nfreebooters such a nuisance (for, so far from checking marauders, the\r\nforest, as a hiding-place, encouraged them), that they complained to\r\nthe Black Prince, and begged that he would get his father to abolish it.\r\n\r\nIn 1376-7, the last year of Edward III.’s reign, the district was\r\ndisafforested. The horn and its rights had passed, by marriages of\r\nfemale heirs, to the Bamvilles, and then to the Stanleys of Hooton\r\nHall. They continued as titular foresters as late as of 7 Henry VI.\r\n\r\nThe horn is thus described:--16¾ in. convex, 13¾ in. concave, 9½ in.\r\nwide at the mouth, 7 in. in the middle, tapering to 2½ in. at the\r\nmouthpiece. The colour is yellow to light brown, with blue or black\r\nspots or flakes. It was in the possession of Sir John Stanley-Errington\r\nuntil his death in 1896.\r\n\r\n_The Delamere Horn._--What we now call the Forest of Delamere was\r\noriginally the two forests of Mara and Mondrem, extending, roughly\r\nspeaking, over all the lands between the rivers Weaver and Gowy. Mara\r\nwas on the Mersey side, and Mondrem on the Nantwich side.\r\n\r\nThe land was afforested immediately after the Conquest, though the\r\nSaxon owner was, for a time, allowed to keep his estate in it. About\r\n1123 Ranulph de Meschines, third Earl of Chester, added to the\r\nforest some waste lands and the villa or township of Kingsley, and\r\nconferred on Ranulph de Kingsley the forestry rights to be held in\r\ngrand serjeantry, and gave him a horn in token of his rights as master\r\nforester. It is worth noting that the horns of Wirral and Delamere were\r\n_both_ given, and at the same period, by this third Earl of Chester.\r\nBut it is important to note that the office of master forester was not\r\naltogether paramount. Certain other rights belonged to the families of\r\nGrosvenors, Weavers, and Mertons; and the rights in the two forests\r\nwere often kept separate and distinct. Finally, however, the whole of\r\nthe forest rights were vested in the family of Done of Utkinton, and in\r\n1617 James I. came “a-hunting” in the forest of Delamere and knighted\r\nJohn Done, who attended him as _chief forester_ and _bow bearer_. Sir\r\nJohn died in 1629, and the male line of Dones came to an end. Through\r\nthe female line the horn and forest rights descended to the Crewes and\r\nArdernes, and then to the present Earl of Haddington, who married Miss\r\nArderne in 1854.\r\n\r\nThe horn is a beautiful black colour and strongly curved. It is 14 in.\r\non outside curve, but it is only 5 in. across from mouthpiece to mouth.\r\nIts greatest width is 1¾ in. at the mouth, and ¾ in. at the other end.\r\nThe mouthpiece seems of silver gilt, but there is no sign of the other\r\ntwo “golden” bands with which pictures and old documents show it was\r\nembellished.\r\n\r\n_Forest of Macclesfield._--The third great forest of Cheshire was that\r\nof Macclesfield, which was in existence before Domesday survey.\r\n\r\nThe office of hereditary master forester of the forests of Leek and\r\nMacclesfield was held by the Davenports of Davenport by a grant from\r\nHugh Cyvelioc, Earl of Chester (1160).\r\n\r\nNow the original grant, as in the case of Mara and Mondrem, did not\r\nprevent subordinate rights being granted, and there were no less than\r\neight sub-foresters who exercised rights down to the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nOne of these foresterships belonged to the manor of Taxal, which was\r\nheld by the Downes of Sutton Downes and Taxal. According to depositions\r\nabout the year 1720, it is said of Reginald Downes, the then owner:--\r\n\r\n “That hee when ye King came a hunting allways rowsed ye stagg, and\r\n when ye King came to ye forest Mr. D. held ye King’s stirrup and ye\r\n L’d Darby held _his_ stirrup; and that the L’d Darby, instead of\r\n actually holding ye stirrup, put his strop or whip and held it towards\r\n ye stirrup while Mr. Downes mounted.\r\n\r\n “That the said Mr. Downes had informed this deponent that he held his\r\n land by the blast of a horn on Midsummer Day, and paying a pepper-corn\r\n yearly; and that once, about 63 or 64 years agoe, this deponent was\r\n with the said Mr. Downes when he blowed his horn at Windcather (a\r\n range of high hills above Taxal) on that occasion.”\r\n\r\nAnother deposition states that the horn required “three blasts.” No\r\nspecial horn seems to have existed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVERBS AND SAYINGS\r\n\r\nThe hard-headed Cheshireman may be deficient in legend, but he has\r\ninvented a number of wise sayings and proverbs which can hold their own\r\nin quality and quantity with any other county. Some of the oldest,\r\nhowever, given by Ray, are wrapped in obscurity. The following is a\r\nselection:--\r\n\r\n              “---- by a proverbe certan\r\n    Good manners and conynge maken a man.”\r\n\r\n                                      Bradshaw (_Life of St. Werburgh_).\r\n\r\n [He was a contemporary of William of Wykeham.]\r\n\r\n “Cheshire, Chief of men.”\r\n\r\n “_Stout, bold, and hardy withal, impatient of wrong, and ready to\r\n resist the enemy or stranger that shall invade their country._”--Webb.\r\n\r\n Fuller says: “_Its gentry is remarkable on a fourfold account--their\r\n numerousness ... their antiquity, their loyalty, and their\r\n hospitality._”\r\n\r\n    “Cheshire for men,\r\n     Berkshire for dogs,\r\n     Bedfordshire for naked flesh,\r\n     And Lincolnshire for bogs.”\r\n\r\n    “By waif, soc and theam,\r\n     You may know Cheshire men.”\r\n\r\n [Powerful in their legal rights and tenacious of them.]\r\n\r\n    “As many Leighs as fleas, Massies as asses,\r\n     Crewes as crows, and Davenports as dogs’ tails.”\r\n\r\n _Some of the great Cheshire families._\r\n\r\n    “There is more than one yew bow in Chester.”\r\n\r\n _As many a Welshman had found out._\r\n\r\n    “Cheshire born and Cheshire bred,\r\n     Strong i’ th’ arm and weak i’ th’ yed.”\r\n\r\n _Perhaps invented by neighbours “over the border” who had felt the\r\n strong arm._\r\n\r\n    “To grin like a Cheshire cat.”\r\n\r\n _No satisfactory explanation of this has ever been given. It has\r\n formed the subject for inquiries innumerable in “Notes and Queries.”_\r\n\r\n _There is another version: “To grin like a Cheshire cat chewing\r\n gravel.”_\r\n\r\n    “It is better to marry over the mixen than over the moor.”\r\n\r\n _It is better to marry an honest farmer from next door whom you know,\r\n than a fine gentleman from a distance who may turn out a fraud._\r\n\r\n    “Enough and no more, like Mrs. Milton’s feast.”\r\n\r\n _Milton married as his third wife Elizabeth Minshull of Wistanstow,\r\n near Nantwich, who survived him. She was poor and proud, and her\r\n enforced economy was not to the taste of her neighbours._\r\n\r\n    “When the daughter is stolen, shut the Pepper-gate.”\r\n\r\n _Equivalent to “shutting the stable door when the steed is stolen.”\r\n This originated in a former Mayor of Chester fastening up the\r\n Pepper-gate after his daughter had eloped through it with her lover._\r\n\r\n    “If thou hadst the rent of Dee Mills--thou wouldst spend it.”\r\n\r\n _These Chester mills yielded annually a large rent._\r\n\r\n    “As fair as Lady Done.”\r\n\r\n _The wife of Sir John Done, hereditary bow-bearer of Delamere Forest.\r\n Pennant, in his “Tour from Chester to London,” says that “when a\r\n Cheshireman would express supereminent excellency in one of the fair\r\n sex, he will say, ‘There is a Lady Done for you.’”_\r\n\r\n    “Higgledy Piggledy--Malpas shot.”\r\n\r\n _All share alike._\r\n\r\n _The well-known anecdote need not be quoted._\r\n\r\n    “All on one side, like Parkgate.”\r\n\r\n _A single street with one side only, the river being on the other\r\n side._\r\n\r\n    “Every man was not born to be Vicar of Bowdon.”\r\n\r\n _One of the most valuable livings in Cheshire._\r\n\r\n    “To pull Lymm from Warburton.”\r\n\r\n _Complete and absolute separation._\r\n\r\n    “Hanged hay never does cattle.”\r\n\r\n _Bought hay, hung and weighed in the scales, is not economical. It\r\n will not do (pronounced “doe”) cattle._\r\n\r\n    “To scold like a wych-waller.”\r\n\r\n _I.e., a “salt-boiler” at one of the wyches of Cheshire._\r\n\r\n    “To catch a person napping, as Moss caught his mare.”\r\n\r\n    “I’ll tell thee, quoth Wood,\r\n     If I can’t rule my daughter, I’ll rule my good.”\r\n\r\n    “But when? quoth Kettle to his mare.”\r\n\r\n _Of these three worthies history is silent._\r\n\r\n    “Like Goodyer’s pig, never well but when he is doing mischief.”\r\n\r\n    “He stands like Mumphazard, who was hanged for saying nothing.”\r\n\r\n    “Like the parson of Saddleworth who could read no book but his own.”\r\n\r\n    “Roint you witch! as Bessy Locket said to her mother.”\r\n\r\n    “No more sib (akin) than sieve and riddle that grew in a wood\r\n         together.”\r\n\r\n    “If he were as long as a lither, he might thatch a house without\r\n         a ladder.”\r\n\r\n    “It would make a dog doff his doublet.”\r\n\r\n    “She hath broken her elbow at the Church door.”\r\n\r\n _A woman grown idle after marriage._\r\n\r\n    “Score twice before you cut once.”\r\n\r\n _Used by curriers.

It is a\r\nversion of _Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table_.\r\n\r\nA farmer going through Alderley Edge, on his way to the fair to sell a\r\nbeautiful white mare, was accosted by a venerable old man dressed as a\r\nmonk, who said:\r\n\r\n    “Sell as thou wilt that steed of thine\r\n    ’Tis fated that the steed be mine.”\r\n\r\nThe farmer found no purchaser, and, returning at night, met the monk by\r\ntwo enormous iron gates, through which they entered into a huge cavern\r\nwhere numbers of milk-white steeds were stalled, and by each lay an\r\narmed warrior asleep. The wizard paid the farmer, who asked the meaning\r\nof the mysterious troopers, and was told that they would, when England\r\n\r\n    “Was thrice lost and thrice won\r\n    ’Twixt dawn of day and setting sun,”\r\n\r\ncome to her aid.\r\n\r\nWhen the wizard ceased, the farmer found himself alone on the hill, and\r\nthe gates closed behind him.\r\n\r\nA dragon legend is connected with Thomas Venables, son of Sir Gilbert\r\nVenables, cousin-german to William the Conqueror:--\r\n\r\n “It chaunced a terrible dragon to remayne and make his abode in the\r\n lordeshippe of Moston in the Countye of Chester, wheare he devoured\r\n all such persons as he laid hold on, which ye said Thomas Venables\r\n herringe tell of ... dyd in his awne person valiantly set on the saide\r\n dragon, where first he shotte hym throwe with an arrowe, and afterward\r\n with other weapons manfullie slew him, at which instant the dragon was\r\n devouringe of a childe.”\r\n\r\nA greater fund of legendary lore is found with regard to the lakes or\r\nmeres of Cheshire:--\r\n\r\nBRERETON--BAG OR BLACK MERE.\r\n\r\n “Here is one exceeding strange, but attested in my hearing by many\r\n persons, and commonly believed. Before any heir of this (Brereton)\r\n family dies, there are seen in a lake adjoining, the bodies of trees\r\n swimming upon the water for several days together.”--Camden.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Sidney, in _Seven Wonders of England_, says:--\r\n\r\n    “The Breretons have a lake, which, when the sun\r\n     Approaching warms (not else) dead logs up sends\r\n     From hideous depth, which tribute when it ends\r\n     Sure sign it is the Lord’s last thread is spun.”\r\n\r\nCAPESTHORN--RUDESMERE, OR REEDSMERE.\r\n\r\nIn the grounds of Capesthorne is a fine sheet of water called\r\nReedsmere, containing a floating island about 1½ acres in size, which\r\nin strong winds is blown here and there. A country legend accounts for\r\nthis floating island by a story that a certain knight was jealous of\r\nhis lady-love, and vowed not to look upon her face until the island\r\nmoved on the face of the mere. But he fell sick, and was nigh to\r\ndeath, when he was nursed back to health by the lady, to reward whose\r\nconstancy a tremendous hurricane tore the island up by the roots.\r\n\r\nROSTHERNE MERE.\r\n\r\n “All kinds of legends are current about Rostherne, as is the case\r\n with most lakes which are reported to be deep. One is, that a mermaid\r\n comes up on Easter Day and rings a bell; another, that it communicates\r\n with the Irish Channel by a subterranean passage; another, that it\r\n once formed with Tabley, Tatton, Mere, and other lakes, a vast sheet\r\n of water that covered the country between Alderley Edge and High\r\n Leigh.”--Hope, _Holy Wells and Traditions_.\r\n\r\nCOMBERMERE\r\n\r\nHas also a bell legend.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLS\r\n\r\nThe Curfew is still tolled at nine o’clock at Chester Cathedral, and\r\nthe big bell used to be tolled whenever the Dean or Bishop was going to\r\npreach, but this has been discontinued. “Curfew” is tolled at many of\r\nthe country churches, sometimes throughout the year, and sometimes only\r\nat harvest-time.\r\n\r\nAt Frodsham Church a small bell, which stood over the chancel arch, was\r\ncalled the “Dag-tale” bell, or “day-telling” bell--probably from being\r\nused to denote the hours of the day to those working in the fields. At\r\nHolmes Chapel, in the parish of Sandbach, there is an entry in 1723 for\r\n“bell ropes to Dag-tail 12s.”\r\n\r\nThe “Pancake” bell is still rung at Congleton on Shrove Tuesday at 11\r\nA.M., and at Tarvin; and at Barthomley and other places it was called\r\nby the expressive name of the “Guttit” bell.\r\n\r\nRay says:--\r\n\r\n “At Nantwich they have a custom like that in Scotland; when anyone is\r\n dead a Bellman goeth about the streets in the morning that the dead\r\n person is to be buried, tinkling a bell he has in his hand, and now\r\n and then makes a stand and invites the people to come to the funeral\r\n at such an hour.”\r\n\r\nPrebendary Garencieres of Chester Cathedral, in his will of 1703,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n “I would have no other invitation to my funeral than by notice given\r\n by the Clerk to the parishioners of Handley and Waverton, and by the\r\n Belman to the people of Chester, of the time when, and the place where\r\n my corps is to be buried.”\r\n\r\nCongleton still preserves three ancient leather belts, on which are\r\nstrung a number of metal bells with rolling clappers. Two belts have\r\nseven, and one has five, and each bell has a different tone. They are\r\nsaid to have been worn by three church officials on the Congleton\r\n“Wake” day, the Feast of St. Peter _ad vincula_, or “St. Peter in\r\nChains.” At midnight of that day three acolytes ran round the town\r\nsummoning the people to church, thereby representing the clanking of\r\nchains. About one hundred years ago the bells fell into the hands of a\r\nfamily of chimney-sweeps, but were ultimately seized and preserved by\r\nthe town authorities. They are unique.\r\n\r\nThe following is a Cheshire distich on bells:--\r\n\r\n    Higher Peover kettles, Lower Peover pans,\r\n    Knutsford sweet music, and Rostherne great drones.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS\r\n\r\nTwo cocks answer one another:--\r\n\r\n    1. “Cocky Keeko!\r\n        The women been master here.”\r\n\r\n    2. “Cocky Keeko!\r\n        It’s the same everywhere.”\r\n                                                     (_South Cheshire._)\r\n\r\nThe “Golden Plover” is called “The Sheep’s Guide” by the Longdendale\r\nshepherds, who say the bird’s note warns the sheep of danger.\r\n\r\nIt is considered bad luck to take the eggs of, or to kill the Robin,\r\nWren, Spotted Fly-catcher, and Swallow, hence the following:--\r\n\r\n    The Martin and the Swallow\r\n    Are God’s Mate and Marrow,\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n    “Are God Almighty’s birds to hollow” (= to _hallow_ or _keep holy_).\r\n\r\nEggs of game-fowl are placed in Magpies’ nests to be hatched, in order\r\nto make the game-cocks fight better.\r\n\r\nThe calling of a green Woodpecker indicates rain.\r\n\r\nThe name of “Boggarts muck” is given to Owl pellets, the idea being\r\nthat the small bones therein are those of fairies eaten by boggarts.\r\n\r\nThe Cuckoo was called “The Welsh ambassador” in Cheshire, because this\r\nherald of spring was generally heard first on the Welsh border.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAMES\r\n\r\nRandle Holme gives an entertaining list of children’s games in the\r\nStuart period, nearly all of which are now obsolete. He does not\r\nmention one which is more popular in Cheshire than the Southern\r\nCounties. This is the game in which a horse chestnut is threaded on a\r\nstring and struck at with chestnuts similarly threaded. The chestnut is\r\ncalled a “coppity-co”:--\r\n\r\n    “Coppity-co,\r\n     My first blow”\r\n\r\nis the rhyme used. The word is now softened into cobbity-co (so in\r\n_Shropshire_) and even into comity-co (_Chester_, 1909).\r\n\r\n    “Cobbity-cuts\r\n     Put daïn your nuts.”\r\n                         (_South Cheshire._)\r\n\r\n_Cop_ is old English for _top_ or _head_.[67] Somnolent church-goers in\r\nolden times had reason to remember this fact.\r\n\r\n  Paid Richard Pennington for whiping dogs and cobing\r\n  sleeping folke                                       £0 10 0\r\n\r\n                                        (_Bunbury Church Accounts._)\r\n\r\n [67] So at Chester, the top of the river bank is called “The Cop,” and\r\n a “cop-hedge” is, in Cheshire, a bank with a hedge on top of it.\r\n\r\nA similar official at Tarvin was familiarly known as “The Cobber,” and\r\nat Tarporley as “The Awakener.”[68]\r\n\r\n [68] The following anecdote, which is vouched for, is too good to\r\n omit:--At a certain Cheshire church, where the farmers slumbered\r\n peacefully during the afternoon sermon, the incumbent was surprised\r\n on a certain Sunday to see the farmers, one after another, waking up\r\n suddenly and vigorously rubbing their faces. At last, looking up in a\r\n gallery to the left of the pulpit, he saw a boy with a pea-shooter, and\r\n at once discerned the cause of the commotion. He shook his fist at the\r\n lad, but to no effect, and at last cried out, “Young man, desist!” but\r\n the boy, bent on his work, replied, “Never thee mind! get along with\r\n thy sermon; I’ll keep the beggars awaken for thee!”\r\n\r\nAnother curious game is “Dot.” Children move in a ring round one\r\nrepresenting “Dot,” and sing:--\r\n\r\n    “Dun yo’ wot, ’oo were Dot?\r\n     He were not a bad lot;\r\n     Whereabouts was his cot,\r\n     Oi’n furgotten to jot.”\r\n                                          (_North Cheshire and Malpas._)\r\n\r\nAt this point “Dot” puts his hand out, and the one touched has to take\r\nhis place. This is practically a “counting-out rhyme,” and there seems\r\nevery probability that it is a very ancient one.\r\n\r\nThe Manor of Edge, in the Hundred of Broxton, was held, according\r\nto _Domesday Survey_, by Edwin, a Saxon thane, who, although he was\r\ncompelled to become tenant to Norman Robert FitzHugh, managed to\r\nretain for himself the two Edges. Contemporary with him was Dot, the\r\nSaxon lord of sixteen manors, some of them conjointly with Edwin; but,\r\nmore unlucky than he, Dot lost all his manors and fled to Wales. His\r\ngrandson, Cadwgan Dot, was father of Hova Dot or Dod, from whom the\r\nEdge and Broxton Dods claim lineal descent.\r\n\r\nThe following are additional “counting-out” specimens:--\r\n\r\n        Orcum, Borcum,\r\n        Boni, Corkum,\r\n    Ericum, Bericum, bo-ni-bus.\r\n        O.U.T. spells out.\r\n                               (_Chester._)\r\n\r\n    One, two,\r\n    Sky-blue;\r\n    All in\r\n    But you.\r\n                   (_Chester_, 1904.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSIC\r\n\r\nAlthough Cheshire cannot be described as a musical county, yet it has\r\nno reason to be ashamed of its past musical history.\r\n\r\n“Cheshire Rounds” was a celebrated tune and dance--sometimes danced by\r\na couple (whose gyrations resembled the movements of the sun and moon)\r\nand sometimes by a single person. The only known portrait of Doggett\r\n(who founded the celebrated waterman’s badge) shows him dancing the\r\n“Cheshire Round.”\r\n\r\nMiss Stanley writes from Alderley Park--\r\n\r\n                                                         _Sep. 8, 1798._\r\n We had yesterday what is generally called a harvest home supper, but\r\n _here_ a “shutting.” Old Peter danced the Cheshire Round on the table\r\n after supper with Charlotte Alcock, one of the women.\r\n\r\nA play-bill of the time of William III. shows how popular the dance was\r\nthen--\r\n\r\n In Bartholomew Fair, at the Coach-house, on the pav’d stones at Hosier\r\n Lane end, you will see a Black that dances the _Cheshire Rounds_ to\r\n perfection.\r\n\r\nThe Morris Dance has always been a favourite, especially in the\r\nKnutsford district, where it was danced to the following:--\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\n    Morris Dance is a very pretty tune,\r\n    I can dance in my new shoon;\r\n    My new shoon they are so good,\r\n    I could dance it if I would.\r\n    This is it, and that is it,\r\n    And this is Morris dancing.\r\n    My poor father broke his leg,\r\n    And so it fell a chancing.\r\n]\r\n\r\nJust over the border, in Lancashire, the version runs--\r\n\r\n    My new shoon, they are so good,\r\n    I could dance Morris if I would;\r\n    And if hat and sark be drest\r\n    I will dance Morris with the rest.\r\n\r\nThree ballads were very popular, viz. “The Miller of the Dee,” “The\r\nSpanish Lady” (who is supposed to have fallen in love with the Cheshire\r\nknight Sir Uryan Leigh), and “The Cheshire Cheese.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURCHES\r\n\r\nThe old parish account-books show that much more was spent on music in\r\nold times than in the present day, _e.g._ _Bunbury_:--\r\n\r\n  1762. For a bassoon                                  £5   5   0\r\n  1787. John Richardson, for instructing the singers    8  17   0\r\n  1801.

It still exists, but the others are extinct.\r\n\r\nAnother wishing well was at Gayton, and a holy well at Alderley Edge.\r\nSt. Plegmund’s Well is in the parish of Plemstall (three miles from\r\nChester). It has been customary for many years to take the water used\r\nfor christenings in the church from this well.\r\n\r\nA chalybeate spring existed in Delamere Forest, and was resorted to by\r\ninvalids in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe largest well now existing is the “Synagogue Well” at Frodsham,\r\nwhich is close to the site of the ancient castle there, and may have\r\nbeen connected with it. It still has a copious supply of water, and\r\nhas been cleansed and repaired, much to the detriment of its former\r\npicturesque appearance.\r\n\r\nThere is no history attached to it nor any explanation of the curious\r\nname. Major Egerton Leigh gives a fancy history of it in his _Ballads\r\nand Legends of Cheshire_.\r\n\r\nNo traces of well-worship exist; but up to a late period the\r\ninhabitants of Nantwich used to sing a hymn of thanksgiving at the\r\n“Blessing of the Brine.” An ancient pit, called the “Old Brine” or\r\n“Biat,” was decked on Ascension Day with flowers, and a jovial band\r\nof young people celebrated the day with song and dance. Aubrey says:\r\n“In Cheshire, where they went in perambulation, they did blesse the\r\nsprings--_i.e._ did read the Gospel at them, and did believe the water\r\nwas better.”\r\n\r\nA remnant of _fire-worship_ existed at Alvanley, where, on the Toot\r\nHill, fires were made in the spring and autumn, through which the\r\nvillagers jumped.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT NIXON\r\n\r\nMention must be made of Robert Nixon, the great Cheshire prophet, whose\r\nfame not only rivalled that of Mother Shipton, but may be said (seeing\r\nthat he is mentioned in _Pickwick_) to have lasted longer. The earliest\r\nhistory is Oldmixon’s, published in 1714, which says that “in the reign\r\nof James I. there lived a fool whose name was Nixon,” and that Thomas\r\nCholmondley of Vale Royal (d. 1652) “took him into his house, where he\r\nlived when he composed this prophecy.” But other writers place him at\r\na much earlier period. His prophecies really fall into the two periods\r\nof civil war, viz. the Wars of the Roses, and the Great Rebellion. If,\r\ntherefore, Nixon was a real personage, it is obvious that if he lived\r\nin the reign of James I. he cannot have uttered some of the prophecies\r\nattributed to him. The discovery of an “Irish Analogue of Nixon’s\r\nProphecy” (_Notes and Queries_, October 21, 1865) throws great doubt on\r\nthe whole matter. The subject still requires much investigation.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of Nixon’s prophecies:--\r\n\r\n    When an eagle shall sit on the top of Vale-Royal House,\r\n    Then an heir shall be born, who shall live to see great troubles\r\n        in England.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Cholmondley family was at this time nearly extinct,\r\nbut in due course an heir was born, during which time an eagle perched\r\non the house-top.\r\n\r\n    Between a rick and two trees\r\n    A famous battle shall be.\r\n\r\nThe “rick and two trees” may be Warwick, Coventry, and Daventry, and\r\nthe battle, Edgehill, 1642; or Rickmansworth, Elstree, and Edwinstree,\r\nand the battle the second fought at St. Alban’s, 1461.\r\n\r\nThe following is unintelligible:--\r\n\r\n There will be three gates to London of imprisoned men for Cowsters.\r\n Then, if you have three cows, at the first gate sell one, and keep\r\n thee at home. At the second gate sell the other two, and keep thee at\r\n home. At the last gate all shall be done.\r\n\r\n_Old Mab’s Curse_ is directed against any one of the Minshull family\r\nwho shall sell the family acres--\r\n\r\n    Mabel’s dole, of pious fame\r\n    From royal blood they say she came;\r\n    Poor and needy folks do tell\r\n    That Mynshull’s land no one dare sell,\r\n    For Old Mab’s curse on him would light\r\n    That ere should sell land, stone, or bight.\r\n\r\nThe belief that bees must be told of their master’s death is widely\r\nspread, also that a winter crop of primroses betokens a death in the\r\nhouse. Powdered alabaster is considered a good remedy for the ailments\r\nof sheep, and the beautiful tomb of Sir Hugh Calveley in Bunbury Church\r\nhas, in consequence, it is said, suffered much mutilation.\r\n\r\nWe find Trowle, the shepherd boy in the Chester play, making much of\r\nhis tar-box as a specific, for the diseases of sheep and cattle were\r\nserious matters for an agricultural people, as the following show:--\r\n\r\n  Paid for a book concerning ye disorders of cattle   £0 1 0[69]\r\n\r\nand in the accounts of St. John’s Church, Chester, the following\r\noccurs five times in 1747:--\r\n\r\n  Paid for a book about the horned cattle             £0 0 8\r\n\r\n [69] Bunbury Church Accounts.\r\n\r\nOne other point remains to be noticed. There is a widely-spread belief\r\nthat the indentures of apprentices in Chester contained a clause\r\nstipulating that they should not be compelled to eat salmon more than\r\nthree days in each week. No such indenture has ever been seen, and the\r\nlate Mr. Frank Buckland offered, in vain, a reward of five pounds for\r\nthe sight of such a document. The tradition exists wherever there is a\r\nsalmon river, but investigation shows that it is without foundation.\r\n\r\nSuch is some of the folk-lore of Cheshire, and there may still be a\r\ngreat deal which has never yet been recorded. It behoves every one to\r\nuse his utmost endeavours to put into print every song, legend, saying,\r\nor custom that he may meet with. Such relics of the past can only now\r\nbe obtained from aged people, and in a few years this source will fail,\r\nand the rising “school-board” generation will neither know nor care for\r\nsuch things. It is well to remember also (to quote another Cheshire\r\nproverb) that “the unlikeliest places are often likelier than those\r\nwhich are likeliest.”\r\n\r\nIt has been impossible to give all references, but especial mention\r\nmust be made of Hazlitt’s and Ray’s _Proverbs_, Mr. Robert Holland’s\r\nvarious papers, _The Cheshire Sheaf_, and some _Bird Notes_ of Mr. T.\r\nA. Coward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TWO CHESHIRE SAINTS\r\n\r\n  By the Archdeacon of Chester\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are justified in giving this title to St. Werburgh and St. Plegmund,\r\nof whom specially this chapter will treat, since both belonged to the\r\nold kingdom of Mercia, of which Cheshire was a part.\r\n\r\nWe owe our knowledge of St. Werburgh to the metrical life of the Saint\r\nwritten by Henry Bradshaw, a monk of St. Werburgh’s Monastery, who died\r\nin 1513. The full title of his work (which was printed in 1521 and\r\nreprinted by the Chetham Society in 1848) is _The Holy Lyfe and History\r\nof Saynt Werburge, very frutefall for all Christen people to rede_.\r\nIt purports to be a translation into English verse from the original\r\nChronicle or Passionary stated by him to be preserved in the Monastery.\r\nHe makes frequent allusions to the Venerable Bede (whom he styles his\r\nauthor), as also to “Master Alfrydus, William Malmsburge, Gyrarde,\r\nPolycronycon, and other mo(re).”\r\n\r\nSt. Werburgh was born about 650, and was the daughter of Wulfhere, King\r\nof Mercia (whose name is perpetuated in Wolverhampton) and Ermenhild\r\nhis wife. She was thus descended from four royal families. Her father\r\nwas the second son of Penda, King of Mercia, who claimed descent from\r\nWoden. Her mother was the daughter of Earconbert, King of Kent, and\r\nwas thus a descendant both of Tytillus, King of East Anglia, and of\r\nSt. Edwin, King of Northumbria. She was also connected with the kings\r\nof France, as St. Ermenhild’s grandfather and great-grandfather both\r\nmarried princesses of that royal house. We may say that she was of\r\nsaintly as well as of royal lineage, for five of her grandfather\r\nPenda’s children (pagan though he himself was) earned the title of\r\nsaints; whilst her mother’s family included the names of St. Hilda, St.\r\nEtheldreda, St. Ethelburga, and St. Sexburga (her mother).\r\n\r\nWulfhere and his queen chiefly lived at Stone in Staffordshire, where\r\nSt. Werburgh, under the care of her good mother, grew up. Bradshaw\r\ngives a very interesting picture of her early years, in which her\r\nreligious disposition, fostered no doubt by her mother’s influence and\r\nexample, manifested itself in various ways. Thus:--\r\n\r\n    “First in the morning to church she would go,\r\n     Following her mother the queene every day,\r\n     With her boke and bedes, and depart not them fro,\r\n     Hear all divine service and her devocyons say:\r\n     And to our Blessed Saviour, mekely on her knees pray,\r\n     Daily Him desiring, for His endless grace and pity,\r\n     To keep her from sin, and preserve her in chastity.”\r\n\r\nShe was an only daughter having three brothers. She listened with\r\nearnest attention to every word of instruction and advice; abjured\r\ngiddy pleasures; and found her truest joy in contemplation of heavenly\r\nthings, and holiest bliss arising from a pure conscience, chastened by\r\nfasting and sanctified by prayer.\r\n\r\nBradshaw gives a full description of her young days, and fondly lingers\r\nover the narration of her virtues. She attracted many suitors, but\r\ncourteously dismissed them all. Among these was the Prince of the West\r\nSaxons, who made offer of marriage and of all his worldly goods:--\r\n\r\n    “Landes, rentes, and libertees all at your pleasure;\r\n     Servantes every hour, your byddynge for to do,\r\n     With ladyes in your chambre to wayte on you also.”\r\n\r\nShe gently but firmly declines, saying:--\r\n\r\n    “But now I shewe you playnly my true mynde,\r\n     My purpose was never maryed for to be;\r\n     A lorde I have chosen, Redeemer of Mankynde\r\n     Jhesu the Second Persone in Trynyte\r\n     To be my Spouse.”\r\n\r\nThe suit of Warbode, a powerful knight and chief steward in her\r\nfather’s household, was attended with disastrous results. He had\r\ngained an evil influence over King Wulfhere, and induced him, if not\r\nto become an actual apostate, to adopt a distinctly hostile attitude\r\nto Christianity. When his suit, though favoured by his master, is\r\ndeclined by St. Werburgh, he retires in wrath and plots revenge. He\r\npoisons the King’s mind, and persuades him that his sons Wulfade and\r\nRuffyn are plotting against him, leads him into the forest, where they\r\nare found in St. Chad’s cell being instructed by the good Bishop in\r\nthe Christian faith; and then in his blind rage the King slays them\r\nboth, and rushes back to his castle. No sooner did he return than he\r\nwas seized with sore pains, the mark of God’s vengeance. Stung with\r\nremorse, he repented of his apostasy; repaired to St. Chad; professed\r\nhis contrition; promised to destroy all idols and temples in his realm\r\nand to build monasteries; and founded the Abbey of Peterborough and a\r\npriory at Stone--\r\n\r\n  “To the honour of God, and these martyrs twayne.”\r\n\r\nAnd now St. Werburgh begs her father to be allowed to become “a\r\nreligious,” and to enter the Abbey of Ely, where her great-aunt, St.\r\nEtheldreda (or Awdry) was the Abbess. Wulfhere is reluctant and slow\r\nto consent, but at length he yields; and, when the matter was once\r\nsettled, does his part nobly.\r\n\r\nAfter her year of probation, St. Werburgh made her holy profession with\r\ngreat solemnity, and her biographer holds her up to the women of his\r\nday as an example of virtue and humility.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Wulfhere, his widow, Ermenhild, herself repaired to\r\nthe convent of Ely, where her mother, St. Sexburga, had succeeded her\r\nsister, St. Etheldreda, as Abbess, and vied with her daughter in piety\r\nand devotion. Wulfhere was succeeded as king by his brother, Ethelred,\r\nto whom, according to Giraldus Cambrensis, is due the building in 689\r\nof the Monastery of St. John the Baptist in Chester. Ethelred fully\r\nappreciated his niece’s character, and, seeing her holy conversation,\r\nmade her Lady and President at Weedon, Trentham, and Hanbury, thus\r\nmaking her ruler of the nuns within his realm. He himself also took\r\nthe vows and became a monk, resigning the crown to his nephew, Cenred,\r\nSt. Werburgh’s brother, who, after a short reign of five years,\r\nfollowed his uncle’s example; went to Rome the year of grace 708, and\r\nwas “professed to Saint Benette’s religion,” and “frome this lyfe\r\ntransitory, with vertu departed to eternal glory.”\r\n\r\nBradshaw goes on to describe “the gostly devocion of Saynt Werburge,\r\nand vertuous governans of her places,” and, if the chronicler is to be\r\ntrusted, she showed a marvellous capacity for ruling her abbeys. Her\r\nbehaviour and character is thus described:--\r\n\r\n    “She was a minister rather than a mistress,\r\n     Her great pre-eminence caused no presumpcion,\r\n     Serving her systers with humble subjection.\r\n     .      .      .      .      .\r\n     Piteous and merciful and full of charity\r\n     To the poor people in their necessity.\r\n     .      .      .      .      .\r\n     She never commanded systers to do anything\r\n     But it was fulfilled in her own doing.”\r\n\r\nEven from these short extracts we can readily gather what a gentle,\r\nlovable personage she must have been, and how in all her relations\r\nof life she manifested a truly humble and Christian spirit. Her life\r\nwas mainly spent between Weedon, Trentham, Repton, and Hanbury, and\r\nwe can imagine what a gracious influence she exercised upon the\r\nreligious houses there and their occupants, and so upon the surrounding\r\nneighbourhoods. It was at Trentham that she died, enjoining,\r\nhowever, that her body should rest at Hanbury. When she felt her end\r\napproaching she gave directions as to her successors and officers in\r\nthe monasteries, and as to how their affairs should be conducted in the\r\nfuture; then, calling the sisters round her, she gave them her last\r\nexhortation, to live in temperance, obedience, and love, recited the\r\nCreed, received the Blessed Sacrament, and--\r\n\r\n    “The third day of February ye may be sure,\r\n     Expired from this life, caduce and transitory,\r\n     To eternal blyss, coronate with victory,\r\n     Changing her lyfe, miserable and thrall,\r\n     For infinite joy, and glory eternal.”\r\n\r\nThis was probably in the year 699. The people of Trentham buried her in\r\nthat place, watching over the body lest it should be removed. However,\r\nthe people of Hanbury came, and, a deep sleep having fallen upon the\r\nwatchers, were enabled to carry the body safely to Hanbury, where it\r\nwas interred in the chancel. Nine years afterwards, in the summer of\r\n708, it was moved from the grave to a duly prepared shrine with great\r\npomp, in the presence of her cousin King Ceolred and the bishops and\r\nthe clergy. Here, says the chronicler, the body remained whole and\r\nsubstantial “for nearly 200 years, till the coming of the pagan Danes,”\r\nwhen “it was resolved and fell to powder lest the wicked miscreants\r\nwith impious hands should dare to touch it.”\r\n\r\nIt was in 875, to save the remains from such violation, that the people\r\nof Hanbury were inspired to bring them to Chester, as the Danes, having\r\ndestroyed Weedon and Trentham, had come as far as Repton. It was then\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n    “The relique, the Shryne full memorative,\r\n     Was brought to Chestre for our consolacion,\r\n     Reverently receyved, set with devocion\r\n     In the mouther Church of Saint Peter and Paule\r\n     (As afore is sayd) a place most principall.”\r\n\r\nA full description is given of the solemn reception of the shrine and\r\nits treasured contents, and also of the gifts wherewith rich and poor\r\nvied with each other to enrich it.[70] The Church of St. Peter and\r\nSt. Paul was probably somewhere on the site of the present cathedral.\r\nEthelfleda, daughter of King Alfred, built a separate minster to St.\r\nWerburgh, joining it to the east end of the older church. This building\r\n(rebuilt, we are told, by Leofric, Earl of Chester) gave place to\r\nthe Norman structure of Hugh Lupus, in the erection of which he was\r\nassisted by the advice of St. Anselm. But through all these changes\r\nand vicissitudes the name of St. Werburgh was associated with the\r\ndedication of the church, and her shrine found its home there.\r\n\r\n [70] According to the Ely Book (_Liber Eliensis_) the relics were\r\n brought to the Abbey of Ely (Wall’s _Shrines of British Saints_).\r\n Certain portions of them may have been carried to either place, or\r\n there may be some confusion as to the name.\r\n\r\nThe shrine was no doubt visited by pilgrims from all parts, and as\r\ntime went on was adorned and beautified. The shrine proper was a box\r\nor receptacle in which the relics of the saint were deposited, and was\r\noften made of the most splendid and costly materials, and enriched with\r\njewels in profusion.\r\n\r\nBradshaw speaks of this portable shrine as “a riall relique” (royal\r\nrelic), and also tells of the “many riall gyftes of jewels to the\r\nshrine.” It was carried about in processions and in times of danger and\r\nemergency, and was “set on the towne walles for help and tuicion”; to\r\nsave Chester from the attacks of the Welsh; and again,\r\n\r\n    “The devout Chanons sette the holy Shryne\r\n     Agaynst their enemies at the sayd Northgate,”\r\n\r\n“when innumerable barbarik nations purposed to disstroye and spoyle\r\nthe city.” Similarly we are told “howe in 1180 a great fire, like to\r\ndestroye all Chestre, by myracle ceased when the holy shryne was borne\r\nabout the towne by the monkes.” As various miracles were ascribed\r\nto her agency in her lifetime, so now her relics were regarded as\r\npowerful instruments in warding off evil whether from individuals or\r\nthe community at large. The shrine would be visited by suppliants from\r\nevery quarter, who would invoke the aid of the Saint to remedy their\r\nvarious ills. For the portable shrine a suitable resting-place would be\r\nerected, one probably giving place to another as successive generations\r\naltered the style and character of the building. Round this stately and\r\nelaborate structure would be places where the suppliants could kneel,\r\nand also receptacles for the offerings which their piety and gratitude\r\ninspired. Of the earlier structures no trace remains, but the fifteenth\r\ncentury one has in recent years been placed at the west end of the\r\nLady Chapel of the Cathedral, as being probably near the spot where it\r\noriginally stood. At the foundation of the See, and up till 1870, the\r\nlower portion formed the base of the Bishop’s Throne, the crown being\r\nlowered so as to form the balustrade in front of the Bishop’s seat. In\r\nthis adaptation certain stones were removed, and were built up in the\r\nwall which enclosed the staircase which led from the Bishop’s study\r\ndirectly into the Cathedral. In removing this staircase in 1885 these\r\nstones were discovered, and have again been placed on the shrine, which\r\nis thus restored to its original proportions. The shrine was adorned\r\nwith canopied niches, in which were sculptured figures bearing their\r\nnames on scrolls, representing the Kings and Saints of the Mercian\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nIt will be gathered from what has been said that though Saint Werburgh\r\nprobably spent no portion of her life in Cheshire, yet she was for\r\nmore than seven hundred years associated in men’s minds with the\r\ncounty, inasmuch as her shrine had its home in Chester. In those days\r\nshe would be looked upon as a Cheshire Saint, and from far and near\r\nreligious pilgrims would come to say their devotions and to tender\r\ntheir offerings at her shrine in the Church which was dedicated to\r\nGod’s service in her name. We are therefore justified in speaking of\r\nher under this heading. And she has left her name in the county in\r\nother ways. Nine churches in England (six of them in the old kingdom\r\nof Mercia) are dedicated in her name. One of these is in Cheshire at\r\nWarburton, _Werburgh town_. That place gave its name to an honoured\r\nCheshire family, which has given its scions to the service of their\r\ncountry in many directions, and which still holds a position of\r\nhigh renown and esteem in the county. We may thus legitimately term\r\nSt. Werburgh a Cheshire Saint. We cannot do better than follow her\r\nfavourite precept and common saying: “Please God and love Him, and\r\ndoubt not anything.”\r\n\r\nThe other subject of our paper is St. Plegmund, to many perhaps\r\nan unknown name, though he rose to a high position, and must have\r\nexercised a wide and beneficent influence on Church and State both in\r\nhis own day and for succeeding generations. He, like St. Werburgh,\r\nwas a native of Mercia, though we cannot give his birthplace or his\r\nparentage. But we can connect him very closely with the county and with\r\nthe neighbourhood of Chester, where his name is still preserved in the\r\nname of a parish, that of Plemstall. This has been variously written at\r\ndifferent times, as Plegmundstall, Plegmondesham, &c. It was here, in\r\nfact, that he established himself as a hermit in an Isle of Chester;\r\nfor though Plemstall is no longer an island, it has been clearly shown\r\nthat in earlier times the locality would justify such description.\r\n\r\nPlegmund was born in troublous times about the middle of the ninth\r\ncentury. The Danes had overrun the land, destroyed the monasteries, the\r\nonly places of learning, and driven the monks from their books. Some\r\nthere were, however, who determined, in spite of all difficulties, to\r\npursue their studies and to pray in solitude for better times, and of\r\nthese Plegmund was one. He had very probably been a monk, though this\r\ncannot be said with certainty. At any rate he adopted the hermit’s\r\nlife, and set up his stall or habitation at Plemstall, then doubtless\r\nan island amid fens and marshes, and by its situation affording a place\r\nof safety in times of disorder and unrest. His lonely dwelling, of\r\nwhich no trace remains, may have been on the site of the present church\r\nor a short distance away, and nearer to the well which still bears his\r\nname. Here he lived the hermit’s life; but we must remember, as Dean\r\nHook tells us, that a hermit was not an anchorite. The latter never\r\nquitted his cell, but was an absolute recluse. The hermit was a more\r\nindependent character; he moved about as occasion demanded. If he had a\r\nsettled abode he would go to places of resort near at hand, and by his\r\npreaching seek to benefit the wayfarers who might be passing by.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine therefore St. Plegmund paying his frequent visits to\r\nthe neighbouring city, only three or four miles distant, taking up his\r\nposition at one or other of its gates (for it was surrounded by its\r\nRoman walls, and though then “waste” must have had some inhabitants),\r\nand instructing out of his laboriously-acquired learning those who were\r\nwilling to pause and listen to his discourse. The anxious inquirer\r\nmight return with him to his island home and, after further preparation\r\nas a catechumen, receive the grace of Holy Baptism at the well above\r\nreferred to. His supply of books or manuscripts would be but small.\r\nThe Bible of course was his constant companion, and it has been\r\nsuggested with confidence that Boethius’ _De Consolatione Philosophiæ_\r\nwould certainly be one of his treasures. This treatise was afterwards\r\ntranslated by King Alfred, a task in which Plegmund may have helped\r\nhim. There is in the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, a\r\ncopy (the oldest in existence) of the Saxon Chronicle, said to have\r\nbeen translated by Plegmund, for which assertion there is internal\r\nevidence of an indirect nature. This, however, was probably done after\r\nhe left this neighbourhood; but the fact may be taken as showing\r\nwhat his powers were, and what a diligent student he must have been,\r\nespecially when we consider the scanty materials which would be at his\r\nservice. He must have acquired some reputation for his learning, and\r\nhis fame reached the ears of King Alfred, who sent for him to his Court\r\nto act as his adult tutor. There he would find Grimbald, Werefrid,\r\nAsser, and others, and with them would be associated with the monarch\r\nin the promotion of learning and in furthering the best interests of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nWe speak of the king as “Alfred the Great,” but then he was known as\r\n“England’s Darling.” Alfred came to the crown in 872, and died in 900.\r\nHow soon after his accession he summoned Plegmund to his side to be his\r\ntutor and instructor we cannot say, but that the relations between\r\nthem were very close and intimate and mutually advantageous, we can\r\nhave no doubt. In the year 890 the see of Canterbury was vacant, and,\r\nhaving been declined by Grimbald, was offered by the King to Plegmund,\r\na step which was received with general approbation, for the entry in\r\nthe Saxon Chronicle runs thus: “This year 890 Plegmund was chosen of\r\nGod and of all the people Archbishop of Canterbury.” Plegmund was\r\nconsecrated at Rome by Pope Formosus, but as some doubt and discredit\r\nwas thrown upon the actions of this pontiff, he paid a second visit to\r\nRome, and was re-consecrated by Pope Stephen, thus submitting to a rite\r\nof more than questionable propriety. He cordially seconded the King in\r\nhis endeavours to establish a learned priesthood. Some justification\r\nhas been alleged for the fact that several sees and posts were for a\r\ntime kept vacant, in the consideration that men of sufficient learning\r\nand education were not to be found for them. At anyrate Plegmund,\r\nscholar and theologian as he was, did all that lay in his power to\r\nremove the reproach which was fastening upon the Church that it had an\r\nignorant and illiterate clergy.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the King, he published _The Pastoral Care_ of\r\nGregory the Great, a copy of which was sent to every English bishop,\r\nwith a noteworthy preface from the King himself, in which the sovereign\r\nacknowledged what he had “learned of Plegmund my Archbishop, and\r\nof Asser my bishop, and of Grimbald my presbyter, and of John my\r\npresbyter.” It is interesting to know that the copy addressed to\r\nPlegmund is still preserved, as well as those addressed to the Bishops\r\nof Worcester and Sherborne. It is reasonable to conclude from this that\r\nAlfred would find in _his_ Archbishop a zealous assistant in all his\r\nefforts to promote sound and religious learning, and that the two would\r\nheartily co-operate in endeavours to secure an educated clergy. Whether\r\nhe ever visited the scene of his former labours, it is impossible to\r\nsay; but the late Mr. Thomas Hughes, F.S.A., in a fancied description\r\nof the laying of the foundation of St. John’s, Chester, writes thus:\r\n“First there were Ethelred and Ethelfleda, the joint founders--near\r\nthem might stand their Royal Ward, Athelstan, the Etheling, heir to\r\nhis father’s throne. Prominent among the group would be Plegmund, the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, a native of Mercia, and but a few years\r\nbefore a modest recluse at the hermitage in that island of Chester.” We\r\ncannot give a detailed account of Plegmund’s episcopate, which lasted\r\nfor twenty-four years; but we are sure that, as he assisted his royal\r\nmaster when at his Court and before he became Archbishop in promoting\r\nlearning amongst his people, so in the higher position and with the\r\nlarger opportunities he must have done the like. Himself a student, he\r\nknew the advantages of learning, and would be anxious to make them as\r\nwidespread as possible.\r\n\r\nAlfred is looked upon as the founder of the University of Oxford, or\r\nof University College, its first hall, and we can understand how in\r\nthat work, in the conception as well as in the performance of it, the\r\nadvice and counsel of his own tutor, Plegmund, would be most valuable.\r\nDuring his pontificate the West Saxon Episcopate was sub-divided,\r\nand the number of sees thereby increased, a clear indication of his\r\nvigorous and strenuous rule. In 909 on the same day no fewer than seven\r\nbishops were consecrated by Plegmund, three of them for newly-founded\r\nsees, and one of these for the extreme west in Devonshire. This was for\r\nKirton, identified as Crediton, and it is interesting to note that the\r\nmillenary of the consecration of Eadulf as the first bishop of Crediton\r\nhas just been celebrated at that place. On that occasion the Bishop\r\nof Bristol (Dr. G. F. Browne), who is an eminent historian, gave a\r\nmost instructive address, referring specially to the work of Plegmund,\r\nand to an earlier Saint connected with Crediton, S. Boniface. It was\r\nprobably owing to that connection that Crediton was chosen as the seat\r\nof the Bishops of Devonshire, a position it retained for more than a\r\nhundred and fifty years. The Archbishop of Canterbury was also present\r\non the occasion, and expressed the hope that the work they were doing\r\nnow, the things they were now starting, and the works they were taking\r\nin hand, might give as good cause to people a thousand years hence\r\nto thank God and take courage, as was given a thousand years ago to\r\nthem by Plegmund and the seven Bishops of whom they had heard that\r\nday. Plegmund died on July 23, 914, and was buried in the Cathedral of\r\nCanterbury. No likeness of him has been left, not even on the coins\r\nwhich bear his name. His life in Cheshire must have been singularly\r\nquiet, and yet we cannot doubt that he was thereby nerved and braced\r\nfor the battle of life, and fitted for the arduous duties of the high\r\nposition to which he was afterwards called.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to St. Plegmund’s Well. It is interesting to\r\nknow that whilst it bore this title in very early deeds, it has for\r\ngenerations been designated “the Christening Well,” as the water for\r\nthe Font for Holy Baptism was drawn from it. Moreover, in the old\r\nchurchwardens’ accounts of the parish, mention is made of an annual\r\npayment made to the clerk for cleaning out this well, and keeping it\r\nfree from weeds. There was some danger of the well being overlooked, as\r\nit is very much overhung by bushes in the hedge at the back of it. The\r\noriginal stone work at the side and bottom had decayed. In the autumn\r\nof 1908 a new curb and back were erected at the expense of Mr. Osborne\r\nAldis, and dedicated on November 10th, when a goodly congregation\r\nassembled, and after a short service in the church, when the story of\r\nSt. Plegmund was unfolded, proceeded to the well where the dedicatory\r\nprayers were said. On the stone-work the following couplet is carved:--\r\n\r\n    “Hic fons Plegmundi functus baptismatis usu\r\n     Regnante Alfredo tunc hodieque solet.”\r\n\r\nThis may be freely translated as follows:--\r\n\r\n    “Here as in days when Alfred erst was king\r\n     Baptismal water flows from Plegmund’s spring.”\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that by this restoration of the well the memory of S.\r\nPlegmund may be preserved: and it is not improbable that the ceremony\r\nof dressing the well, not uncommon in the adjoining county of\r\nDerbyshire, may be adopted as a village festival on July 23rd, the day\r\nof St. Plegmund’s death.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Note._--The preceding chapter embodies the substance of two papers by\r\n the same writer, read before Meetings of the Chester and North Wales\r\n Archæological and Historic Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbess of Ely, St. Etheldreda, 266\r\n  Abbey, Birkenhead, 14, 34, 36\r\n  ---- Combermere, 14, 34, 35\r\n  ---- Mobberley, 14, 34\r\n  ---- Norton, 14, 34\r\n  ---- Pulton, 14, 35\r\n  ---- Runcorn, 14\r\n  ---- Stanlaw, 14, 34\r\n  ---- St. Werburgh’s, 9-13, 33, 34, 38-48\r\n  ---- Vale Royal, 14, 34, 35\r\n  Abbot’s Well, 260\r\n  _Academy of Armoury, The_, 136, 137\r\n  _Account of the Rolls of the Honour of Halton, An_, 107\r\n  Acton Church, 16\r\n  ---- Lord, 18\r\n  Adlington, 200\r\n  ---- Hall, 16, 84, 94\r\n  Aganippe’s Well, 260\r\n  Alderley Edge, Celtic legend, 252\r\n  ---- ---- farmhouse, 94\r\n  Aldford Castle, 51, 52\r\n  Alfred the Great, 272\r\n  Almshouses in Commonhall Lane, Chester, 86, 87\r\n  Alvanley, fire-worship at, 261\r\n  Ancient poaching, 108\r\n  ---- timber houses at--Adlington, 200;\r\n    Baguley, 200;\r\n    Bramhall, 200;\r\n    Little Moreton, 200\r\n  Anselm, St., 8, 269\r\n  _Anti-Christ_, a Mystery Play, 163\r\n  Archbishop of Canterbury, St. Plegmund, 273\r\n  ---- of York, Thomas Savage, 14\r\n  Architecture of Cheshire, half-timbered, 80-99\r\n  Arley Hall, 198\r\n  Arneway, author of Mystery Plays, 148\r\n  “Articles of Surrender,” Chester, 186\r\n  Ashley Hall, 197\r\n  _Assumption, The_, a Mystery Play, 160, 163\r\n  Aston, Sir Arthur, 119\r\n  ---- Sir Thomas, 119\r\n  Audley and the Welsh raids, James, Lord, 10\r\n  ---- James, Lord, 115\r\n  ---- Lord, 13\r\n  Author of Mystery Plays--Arneway, 148;\r\n    Ralf Higden, 147\r\n\r\n  Bebington Cross, 211\r\n  Baddiley Church, 67\r\n  Baguley, or Baggily Hall, 85-89, 200\r\n  Bakers’ Charter, Chester, 147\r\n  Ballads, 259\r\n  “Banes” or “Banns” of Mystery Plays, 153, 154-160\r\n  Bangor Monachorum, 220\r\n  ---- Monastery of, 4\r\n  Baptistery, Italian font in St. Werburgh’s, 45\r\n  Barlow, T.
