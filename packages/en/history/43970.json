For why keep an exact record of\r\ndoings with which every one is familiar? It follows that many of the\r\nevery day happenings, the manners and customs of daily life--much of\r\nthe intimate detail of existence in the Colony, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, have been lost forever.\r\n\r\nFew realize how modern are the furnishings and comforts of our\r\npresent-day houses and how different was the home life of our\r\nancestors. Chairs were unknown in ordinary English households until\r\na generation or so before the sailing of the _Mayflower_. Hats were\r\nworn at meals and the use of table forks did not become general\r\nuntil the last of the 1600s. Food was placed in the mouth with the\r\nknife or the fingers. Washing the hands and face was not considered\r\nessential on rising from bed in the morning and few of the laboring\r\nclasses in any country in Europe washed their faces every day.\r\n\r\nThis is a collection of source materials, somewhat digested, rather\r\nthan a comprehensive, well-balanced narrative of daily life in the\r\nColony--an impossible task at this late day. Moreover, the exact\r\nlimitations of the Colonial Period have not been observed too\r\nclosely as it has seemed desirable to include some material from\r\nnewspapers and other later sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     I.

Francis Higginson, the first minister\r\nat Salem, \"be careful to be strongly instructed what things are\r\nfittest to bring with you for your more comfortable passage at sea,\r\nas also for your husbandry occasions when you come to the land.\r\nFor when you are once parted with England you shall meete neither\r\nmarkets nor fayres to buy what you want. Therefore be sure to\r\nfurnish yourselves with things fitting to be had before you come:\r\nas meale for bread, malt for drinke, woolen and linnen cloath, and\r\nleather for shoes, and all manner of carpenters tools, and a great\r\ndeale of iron and steele to make nails, and locks for houses, and\r\nfurniture for ploughs and carts, and glasse for windows, and many\r\nother things which were better for you to think of there than to\r\nwant them here.\"[1] Elsewhere the good pastor set down \"A catalogue\r\nof such needfull things as every Planter doth or ought to provide to\r\ngo to New England\" in which he enumerated the necessary victuals per\r\nperson for the first year, viz.:\r\n\r\n  [1] Rev. Francis Higginson, _New-Englands Plantation_, London, 1630.\r\n\r\n\"8 Bushels of meale, 2 Bushels of pease, 2 Bushels of Otemeale,\r\n1 Gallon of Aquavitae, 1 Gallon of Oyle, 2 Gallons of Vinegar, 1\r\nFirkin of Butter; also Cheese, Bacon, Sugar, Pepper, Cloves, Mace,\r\nCinnamon, Nutmegs and Fruit.\"\r\n\r\nThe household implements listed were: \"1 Iron pot, 1 Kettel, 1\r\nFrying pan, 1 Gridiron, 2 Skellets, 1 Spit, Wooden Platters, Dishes,\r\nSpoons and Trenchers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Higginson listed in detail the food supplies required per\r\nperson for a year, including a good variety of spices; and also the\r\nclothing for a man, which included a Monmouth cap, a suit of canvas,\r\na suit of freize, a suit of cloth, four pairs of shoes, three shirts\r\nand three falling bands, a pair of blankets, a coarse rug and seven\r\nells of canvas with which to make a bed and bolster. The settler\r\nmust also bring with him a complete armor, with a long piece, sword,\r\nbandoleer and ammunition, tools for cultivating the soil and for\r\nworking wood, and also household implements--a limited equipment,\r\ncomparable with the kit packed by the scout or mining prospector of\r\nmore recent times.\r\n\r\nOn looking backward over the span of three centuries, Time lends\r\nan enchantment to these Puritan forefathers of present-day\r\nMassachusetts. Worshiping descendants have placed halos about their\r\nheads and the hardships of life during the early years have been\r\nmagnified to the extent that these independent-minded Englishmen\r\nhave become types of suffering fortitude--martyrs to the noble cause\r\nof free religion and self-government. That is a long tale, however,\r\ncarrying with it many qualifications, and cannot be enlarged upon\r\nhere. In what follows, it should always be borne in mind that aside\r\nfrom the Dutch at New Amsterdam and the small colony of Swedes\r\non the Delaware, it was English stock that settled the American\r\ncolonies and that these men and women brought with them a background\r\nof generations of English life. Their standards of living, manner of\r\nworking their trades and natural aptitude for barter and commerce\r\nwere all modeled upon English life and customs. It was only\r\nnatural that this should be so. The ships crossed the Atlantic at\r\ncomparatively frequent intervals and their holds came filled with\r\nall kinds of necessities and luxuries required by English standards\r\nof living--foodstuffs, fabrics and implements which the shops of\r\nLondon, Plymouth or Bristol could supply and which could not be\r\nproduced by the American settlements. To obtain these refinements of\r\nlife the colonists required only money or merchandise. Lumber, raw\r\nor manufactured, salted fish, beaver and peltry, plantation-built\r\nvessels and other products of the colonies, could be easily\r\nconverted into the comforts of English life for sale in the shops\r\nacross the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Francis Higginson came over in the _Talbot_, a ship of\r\nthree hundred tons burden, which was armed with nineteen guns\r\nand carried a crew of thirty men. She brought over one hundred\r\npassengers. Sailing with her was the ship _George_ of three hundred\r\ntons, in which came fifty-two passengers and a stock of cattle,\r\ntwelve mares, thirty cows and some goats. From the original records\r\nof the Massachusetts Bay Company in New England we learn what\r\nfood supplies were shipped on board the _Talbot_ for the American\r\nvoyage. The amount was supposed to be sufficient for one hundred and\r\nthirty-five men for three months. As a matter of fact, the voyage\r\nfrom Gravesend to the anchorage in Salem harbor occupied sixty-eight\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe ship carried 22 hogsheads of salted beef, 12,000 of bread\r\n(biscuits), 40 bushels of peas, 20 barrels of oatmeal, 450 pounds\r\nof salt fish, 10 firkins of butter and 1,200 pounds of cheese. To\r\nwash down this food they took on board 6 tons of water, 45 tons of\r\nbeer, 20 gallons of brandy, 20 gallons of Spanish wine (Malaga and\r\nCanary), 2 tierces of beer vinegar and 20 gallons of olive oil.[2]\r\nDuring the voyage two died of smallpox, including a blasphemous\r\nseaman. A child died of consumption and a dog fell overboard and\r\ncould not be recovered. The rest came through and reached Salem\r\nharbor in a good state of health.\r\n\r\n  [2] _Transactions of the American Antiquarian Society_, Vol. III, p.\r\n  12.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Bay Company seems to have maintained a \"company\r\nstore,\" in the modern phrase, at which the colonists might obtain\r\nclothing, fabrics, foodstuffs and supplies of all sorts. When\r\nGovernor Endecott came over in 1628, the Company sent extra clothing\r\nsufficient for one hundred men including three hundred suits of\r\nclothes, four hundred shirts and four hundred pairs of shoes. Two\r\nhundred of the suits of clothes consisted of doublet and hose made\r\nup of leather, lined with oiled skin leather, and fastened with\r\nhooks and eyes. The other suits were made up of Hampshire kerseys,\r\nthe doublets lined with linen and the hose with skins. There were\r\na hundred waistcoats of green cotton bound about with red tape, a\r\nhundred Monmouth caps, at two shillings each, five hundred red knit\r\ncaps, milled, at five pence each, and one hundred black hats, lined\r\nin the brows with leather. This store supplied the natural wear and\r\ntear of headgear among the hundred men. The stock contained four\r\nhundred pairs of knit stockings, ten dozen pairs of Norwich garters,\r\nthree hundred plain falling bands, two hundred handkerchiefs and\r\na stock of sheer linen with which to made up other handkerchiefs.\r\nScotch ticking was supplied for beds and bolsters, with wool to put\r\ntherein. The blankets were of Welsh cotton and fifty rugs were sent\r\nover to place over the blankets, while mats were supplied \"to lye\r\nvnder 50 bedds aboard shippe.\"[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] _Transactions of the American Antiquarian Society_, Vol. III, p.\r\n  6.\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years that followed the settlement of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay, a continuous flow of emigration from England\r\ncrossed the Atlantic in all kinds of available sailing craft.[4]\r\nThe passage usually cost £5 per person and this included provisions\r\nprovided by the ship such as \"salt Beefe, Porke, salt Fish, Butter,\r\nCheese, Pease, Pottage, Water-grewell, and such kinde of Victualls,\r\nwith good Biskets, and sixe-shilling Beere; yet it will be necessary\r\nto carry some comfortable refreshing of fresh victuall. As first,\r\nfor such as have ability, some Conserves, and good Clarret Wine\r\nto burne at Sea; Or you may have it by some of your Vintners or\r\nWine-Coopers burned here, & put into Vessels, which will keepe much\r\nbetter than other burnt Wine, it is a very comfortable thing for the\r\nstomacke; or such as are Sea-sicke: Sallat-oyle likewise, Prunes are\r\ngood to be stewed: Sugar for many things: White Biskets, and Egs,\r\nand Bacon, Rice, Poultry, and some weather-sheepe to Kill aboard\r\nthe Ship: and fine flowre-baked meates, will keepe about a weeke or\r\nnine days at Sea. Iuyce of Lemons well put up, is good either to\r\nprevent or curre the Scurvy.[5] Here it must not be forgotten to\r\ncarry small Skillets or Pipkins, and small frying-panns, to dresse\r\ntheir victualls in at Sea. For bedding, so it be easie, and cleanly,\r\nand warme, it is no matter how old or coarse it be for the use of\r\nthe Sea: and so likewise for Apparrell, the oldest cloathes be the\r\nfittest, with a long coarse coate to keepe better things from the\r\npitched ropes and plankes. Whosoever shall put to Sea in a stoute\r\nand well-conditioned ship, having an honest Master, and loving\r\nSeamen, shall not neede to feare, but he shall finde as good content\r\nat Sea, as at Land.[6]\r\n\r\n  [4] Between 1630 and 1643,198 ships brought over 21,200\r\n  passengers.--Edward Johnson, _Wonder Working Providence_, London,\r\n  1654.\r\n\r\n  John Josselyn, coming to New England in 1638, mentions in his\r\n  journal of the voyage sighting or speaking thirteen vessels between\r\n  the Scilly Isles and the New England coast.\r\n\r\n  [5] Anti-scorbutics were very necessary for the long voyage. John\r\n  Josselyn during his first voyage (1638) writes that a young man, a\r\n  servant to one of the passengers, \"was whipt naked at the Cap-stern,\r\n  with a Cat with Nine tails, for filching 9 great Lemmons out of the\r\n  Chirurgeons Cabbin, which he eat rinds and all in less than an hours\r\n  time.\"\r\n\r\n  [6] William Wood, _New-Englands Prospect_, London, 1634.\r\n\r\nThe _Mayflower_ shipped 15,000 brown biscuit and 5,000 white, that\r\nis, hard bread, i.e. crackers; also smoked or half-cooked bacon, as\r\nit came from the smokehouse, which was much liked with the biscuit\r\nand when fried was considered a delicacy. Haberdyne (dried salted\r\ncodfish) was also a staple article of diet; also smoked herring.\r\nPotatoes were practically unknown at that time and the store of\r\ncabbages, turnips, onions, parsnips, etc., soon ran short and gave\r\nway to boiled mush, oatmeal, pease puddings, etc. Their beer was\r\ncarried in iron-bound casks.\r\n\r\nWhen passengers came aboard vessels bound for New England in those\r\nearly days, how did they stow themselves and their possessions?\r\nThe _Mayflower_ had a length of about 110 feet and measured about\r\n244 tons. It was originally intended that she should carry ninety\r\npassengers, men, women and children, but when the _Speedwell_ put\r\nback, twelve of her passengers were taken aboard, and two boys were\r\nborn during the voyage. The ship also carried a crew of twenty to\r\ntwenty-five men, and officers and petty officers, about sixteen\r\nin number, would bring the total of those aboard to one hundred\r\nand forty or more. Goats, pigs, and poultry occupied pens on the\r\nupper or spar deck and in the boats carried there. Small sleeping\r\ncabins were provided for the ship's officers and the more important\r\npassengers; most of the company slept in narrow bunks, in hammocks,\r\nand on pallet beds of canvas filled with straw, placed on the deck\r\nbeneath the hammocks. The crew bunked in the forecastle. The chests\r\nand personal possessions of the passengers were stowed below on the\r\nlower deck where the food, water and ship's stores were kept. On the\r\n_Arbella_, Governor Winthrop's ship, the male passengers lodged on\r\nthe gundeck and four men were \"ordered to keep that room clean.\"\r\n\r\nThe ship _Whale_, in 1632, brought thirty passengers, including\r\nMr. Wilson and Mr. Dummer, all in good health, and seventy cows\r\nof which they lost but two. The ship _Regard_ of Barnstaple, 200\r\ntons, arrived in 1634, brought twenty passengers and about fifty\r\ncattle. The ship _Society_ of Boston, N. E., 220 tons, with a crew\r\nof thirty-three men, arrived in 1663, with seventy-seven passengers.\r\nA notable example of fortitude is found in the voyage of the sloop\r\n_Sparrow Hawk_, that sailed from London in 1626 for Virginia and\r\nhaving been blown off her course was wrecked on Cape Cod.\r\n\r\nShe was only forty feet in length, had a breadth of beam of twelve\r\nfeet and ten inches, and a depth of nine feet, seven and one-half\r\ninches. Bradford in his _History_ records that she carried \"many\r\npassengers in her and sundrie goods ... the cheefe amongst these\r\npeople was one Mr. Fells and Mr. Sibsie, which had many servants\r\nbelonging unto them, many of them being Irish. Some others ther were\r\ny^t had a servante or 2 a piece; but y^e most were servants, and\r\nsuch as were ingaged to the former persons, who also had y^e most\r\ngoods ... they had been 6 weeks at sea, and had no water, nor beere,\r\nnor any woode left, but had burnt up all their emptie caske.\"[7] And\r\nthis happened in the month of December!\r\n\r\n  [7] William Bradford, _History of Plymouth Plantation_, Boston,\r\n  1856.\r\n\r\nIn those days cooking on shore was done in an open fireplace. On\r\nshipboard, the larger vessels were provided with an open \"hearth\"\r\nmade of cast iron sometimes weighing five hundred pounds and over.\r\nMore commonly a hearth of bricks was laid on deck, over which stood\r\nan iron tripod from which the kettles hung. More crudely still a\r\nbed of sand filled a wooden frame and on this the fire was built,\r\ncommonly of charcoal. On the ship _Arbella_, in which came Governor\r\nJohn Winthrop and his company, in 1630, the \"cookroom\" was near a\r\nhatchway opening into the hold. The captain, his officers and the\r\nprincipal men among the passengers dined in the \"round house,\"\r\na cabin in the stern over the high quarter-deck. Lady Arbella\r\nJohnson and the gentlewomen aboard dined in the great cabin on the\r\nquarter-deck. The passengers ate their food wherever convenient on\r\nthe main deck or in good weather, on the spar deck above. Years\r\nlater, a new ship lying at anchor in Boston harbor was struck by\r\nlightning which \"melted the top of the iron spindle of the vane of\r\nthe mainmast\" and passing through the long boat, which lay on the\r\ndeck, killed two men and injured two others as \"they were eating\r\ntogether off the Hen-Coop, near the Main Mast.\"\r\n\r\nThe ship supplied each passenger with a simple ration of food\r\ndistributed by the quartermasters, which each family or self\r\narranged group of passengers cooked at a common hearth as\r\nopportunity and the weather permitted. Of necessity much food was\r\nserved cold and beer was the principal drink. John Josselyn, Gent.,\r\nwho visited New England in 1638, records \"the common proportion of\r\nVictualls for the Sea to a Mess, being 4 men, is as followeth:\r\n\r\n\"Two pieces of Beef, of 3 pound and 1/4 _per_ piece.\r\n\r\n\"Four pound of _Bread_.\r\n\r\n\"One pint 1/4 of _Pease_.\r\n\r\n\"Four Gallons of _Bear_, with _Mustard_ and _Vinegar_ for three\r\nflesh dayes in the week.\r\n\r\n\"For four fish dayes, to each Mess _per_ day, two pieces of _Codd_\r\nor _Habberdine_, making three pieces of fish.\r\n\r\n\"One quarter of a pound of _Butter_.\r\n\r\n\"Four pound of _Bread_.\r\n\r\n\"Three quarters of a pound of _Cheese_.\r\n\r\n\"_Bear_ is before.\r\n\r\n\"_Oatmeal per_ day, for 50 men, Gallon 1. and so proportionable for\r\nmore or fewer.\r\n\r\n\"Thus you see the ship's provision, is _Beef_ or _Porke_, _Fish_,\r\n_Butter_, _Cheese_, _Pease_, _Pottage_, _Water gruel_, _Bisket_, and\r\nsix-shilling _Bear_.\r\n\r\n\"For private fresh provision, you may carry with you (in case\r\nyou, or any of yours should be sick at Sea) Conserves of _Roses_,\r\n_Clove-Gilliflowers_, _Wormwood_, _Green-Ginger_, _Burnt-Wine_,\r\n_English Spirits_, _Prunes_ to stew, _Raisons_ of the _Sun_,\r\n_Currence_, _Sugar_, _Nutmeg_, _Mace_, _Cinnamon_, _Pepper_ and\r\n_Ginger_, _White Bisket_, or _Spanish Rusk_, Eggs, Rice, _Juice_\r\nof _Lemmons_, well put up to cure, or prevent the Scurvy. Small\r\n_Skillets_, _Pipkins_, _Porrengers_, and small _Frying pans_.\r\n\r\n\"To prevent or take away Sea sickness, Conserve of _Wormwood_ is\r\nvery proper.\"[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] John Josselyn, _Two Voyages to New England_, London, 1675.\r\n\r\nThe settler also must take with him a supply of food to answer his\r\nneeds on reaching Massachusetts, and it was advised that enough for\r\nthe space of a year might be required in which case each person\r\nshould be certain to have in store 8 bushels of meal, 2 bushels\r\npease, 2 bushels oatmeal, 1 gallon brandy, 1 gallon oil and 2\r\ngallons vinegar. Sugar could be had in New England as the Colonial\r\nvessels were bringing it from the West Indies in the way of trade,\r\nbut spices, necessary to the English diet, must be brought from\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nJohn Josselyn, writing in 1638, listed the following articles as\r\nnecessary equipment for every family coming to New England, viz.:\r\n\r\n  Bellows                   £0  2 0\r\n  Scoop                         0 9\r\n  Great pail                    0 10\r\n  Casting shovel                0 10\r\n  A sack                        2 4\r\n  Lanthorn                      1 3\r\n  Tobacco pipes\r\n  5 broad howes                10 0\r\n  5 narrow howes                6 8\r\n  5 felling axes                7 6\r\n  2 hand saws                  10 0\r\n  1 whip saw                   10 0\r\n  1 file and wrest                10\r\n  2 hammers                     2 0\r\n  2 augers                      1 0\r\n  Wheels for a cart            14 0\r\n  Wheel barrow                  6 0\r\n  Canoe                      3  0 0\r\n  Short oak ladder              0 10\r\n  Plough                        3 9\r\n  Axle tree                     0 8\r\n  Cart                         10 0\r\n  3 shovels                    4  6\r\n  2 spades                     3  0\r\n  2 broad axes                 7  4\r\n  6 chisels                    3  0\r\n  3 gimblets                   0  6\r\n  2 hatchets                   3  6\r\n  2 frows                      3  0\r\n  2 hand bills                 3  4\r\n\r\n  Nails of all sorts        2  0  0\r\n  3 locks and 3 pr. fetters    5  10\r\n  2 curry combs                0  11\r\n  Brand for beasts             0  6\r\n  Hand vise                    2  6\r\n  100 wt. spikes nails and\r\n    pins (120)              2  5  0\r\n  2 pick axes               0  3  0\r\n  Chain and lock for\r\n   a boat                      2  2\r\n  Coulter (10 pound)           3  4\r\n  Pitch fork                   1  4\r\n\r\nHousehold implements for a family of six persons, viz.:\r\n\r\n  Plough share                 2  11\r\n\r\n  1 iron pot                0  7  0\r\n  1 great copper kettle     2  0  0\r\n  1 small kettle              10  0\r\n  1 lesser kettle              6  0\r\n  1 large frying pan           2  6\r\n  1 small frying pan           1  8\r\n  1 brass mortar            0  3  0\r\n  1 spit                       2  0\r\n  1 grid iron                  1  0\r\n  2 skillets                   5  0\r\n  Platters, dishes and\r\n     spoons of wood            4  0\r\n\r\nThe above prices are estimated costs in England and the freight on\r\nthe same would be reckoned at the rate of half a ton per person.\r\n\r\nThe vessels which carried the great emigration to New England\r\nbetween 1630 and 1640 were of small tonnage and the passenger\r\naccommodations on board were limited in space and barren of creature\r\ncomforts. Small wonder that the health of many of the first\r\nsettlers, shaken by the passage at sea, paid toll to the severity of\r\nthe New England climate--the biting cold of the winter and the heat\r\nof the summer days to which they were unaccustomed.\r\n\r\n\"It was not because the Country was unhealthful, but because their\r\nbodies were corrupted with sea-diet, which was naught, their Beefe\r\nand Porke being tainted, their Butter and Cheese corrupted, their\r\nFish rotten, and voyage long, by reason of crosse Windes, so\r\nthat winter approaching before they could get warme houses, and\r\nthe searching sharpnes of that purer Climate, creeping in at the\r\ncrannies of their crazed bodies, caused death and sickness.\"[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] Wood, _New-Englands Prospect_, London, 1634.\r\n\r\nThe ship _Talbot_, on which Mr. Higginson sailed, brought over\r\none hundred passengers and thirty seamen. She measured nearly\r\neighty-six feet in length and had a depth of hold of eleven feet.\r\nBy present-day measurement she was about two hundred tons burden.\r\nThe space between decks, where the passengers slept and spent much\r\ntime during the dreary voyage, was so low that a tall man could not\r\nstand erect, and whenever a severe storm arose, so that the ports\r\nand hatches must be kept closed, the air below deck in time must\r\nhave become intolerable. Such a storm arose when the _Talbot_ was\r\nthirty-three days out and \"ye wind blew mightily, ye sea roared and\r\nye waves tossed us horribly; besides it was fearfull darke and ye\r\nmariners made us afraid with their running here and there and lowd\r\ncrying one to another to pull at this and y^t rope.\"\r\n\r\nThese small emigrant ships of the seventeenth century, besides men,\r\nwomen and children, brought over much livestock housed in temporary\r\npens and shelters built amidships. The long boat or pinnace was also\r\ncarried on board, all of which left little room for movement about\r\nthe deck. But these three hundred tons ships were traveling palaces\r\nwhen compared with some of the smaller craft that boldly ventured\r\nacross the Atlantic. Barks, ketches, pinks and other small vessels\r\nof less than fifty tons burden were common. In 1635, a \"small\r\nNorsey bark\" of twenty-five tons reached Boston. She was bound for\r\nConnecticut, but a stormy voyage had forced her to seek safety in\r\nBoston harbor. This vessel, little over thirty feet in length,\r\nbrought over fourteen passengers, including two women, with their\r\nhousehold goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHEIR EARLY SHELTERS AND LATER DWELLINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a widespread misconception that the colonists on reaching\r\nMassachusetts proceeded immediately to build log houses in which\r\nto live. Historians have described these log houses as chinked\r\nwith moss and clay and as having earth floors, precisely the type\r\nof house built on the frontier and in the logging camps at a much\r\nlater period. A well-known picture of Leyden Street, at Plymouth,\r\nshows a double row of log houses reaching up the hillside, which\r\nthe Pilgrims are supposed to have constructed. In point of fact, no\r\ncontemporary evidence has been found that supports the present-day\r\ntheory. The early accounts of what took place in the days following\r\nthe settlement along the coast are full of interesting details\r\nrelating to day-by-day happenings but nowhere do we find allusion\r\nto a log house such as modern historians assume existed at that\r\ntime. This unique form of construction, however, had been used in\r\nScandinavia since the Middle Ages and also in parts of Germany, but\r\nnever did it appear in England. It also is well established that the\r\nNorth American Indians knew nothing of this method of construction,\r\neven the Iroquois tribe who built a \"long house,\" so-called.\r\n\r\nThe Swedes and Finns who settled in Delaware in 1638 introduced the\r\nlog house built of logs with notched ends, with which they were\r\nfamiliar in their homeland. What more natural? Jasper Dankers and\r\nPeter Sluyter, Dutch travelers, made a tour of the American colonies\r\nin 1679-1680, and while passing through New Jersey, describe the\r\nhouse of Jacob Hendricks, near the town of Burlington, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The house, although not much larger than where we were the last\r\nnight, was somewhat better and tighter, being made according to\r\nthe Swedish mode, and as they usually build their houses here,\r\nwhich are block-houses, being nothing less than entire trees, split\r\nthrough the middle, or squared out of the rough, and placed in the\r\nform of a square, upon each other, as high as they wish to have the\r\nhouse; the ends of these timbers are let into each other, about a\r\nfoot from the ends, half of one into half of the other, the whole\r\nstructure is thus made without a nail or a spike. The ceiling\r\nand roof do not exhibit much finer work, except amongst the most\r\ncareful people, who have the ceiling planked and a glass window.\r\nThe doors are wide enough, but very low, so that you have to stoop\r\nin entering. These houses are quite tight and warm: but the chimney\r\nis placed in a corner. My comrade and myself had some deer skins,\r\nspread upon the floor to lie on, and we were, therefore, quite well\r\noff and could get some rest.\"[10]\r\n\r\n  [10] _Memoirs of the Long Island Historical Society_, Vol. I.\r\n\r\nThese travelers also spent a night at a Quaker's house near where a\r\ngristmill had been erected on a creek above the falls at what is now\r\nTrenton.\r\n\r\n\"Here we had to lodge: and although we were too tired to eat, we had\r\nto remain sitting upright the whole night, not being able to find\r\nroom enough to lie upon the ground. We had a fire, however, but the\r\ndwellings are so wretchedly constructed, that if you are not close\r\nto the fire, as almost to burn yourself, you cannot keep warm, for\r\nthe wind blows through them everywhere. Most of the English and many\r\nothers, have their houses made of nothing but clapboards, as they\r\ncall them there, in this manner: they first make a wooden frame, the\r\nsame as they do in Westphalia, but not so strong, they then split\r\nthe boards of clapboard, so that they are like cooper's pipe-staves,\r\nexcept they are not bent. These are made very thin, with a large\r\nknife, so that the thickest edge is about a little finger thick, and\r\nthe other is made sharp, like the edge of a knife. They are about\r\nfive or six feet long, and are nailed on the outside of the frame,\r\nwith the ends lapped over each other. They are not usually laid so\r\nclose together, as to prevent you from sticking a finger between\r\nthem, in consequence either of their not being well joined, or the\r\nboards being crooked. When it is cold and windy, the best people\r\nplaster them with clay. Such are most all the English houses in the\r\ncountry.\"[11]\r\n\r\n  [11] _Memoirs of the Long Island Historical Society_, Vol. I.\r\n\r\nThe only type of log construction in use in New England in the early\r\ndays existed in garrison houses built as a protection against the\r\nIndians. In every instance the logs were carefully hewed square,\r\nto make a close fit against each other, and never notched at the\r\nends, sometimes halved at the corners of the structure, but usually\r\ndove-tailed into each other at the ends in medieval military manner.\r\nSeveral of these garrison houses still exist and although afterwards\r\nused as dwellings, at first they were built as forts.\r\n\r\nWhat happened at the Plymouth Colony after the _Mayflower_ came\r\nto anchor? The wind blew very hard for two days and the next day,\r\nSaturday, December 23, 1620, as many as could went ashore: \"felled\r\nand carried timber, to provide themselves stuff for building,\"\r\nand the following Monday \"we went on shore, some to fell timber,\r\nsome to saw, some to rive, and some to carry; so no man rested all\r\nthat day.\"[12] Bradford writes \"that they builte a forte with good\r\ntimber\" which Isaac de Rasieres described in 1627 as \"a large square\r\nhouse, made of thick sawn planks, stayed with oak beams.\" The oldest\r\nexisting houses in the Plymouth Colony are built in the same manner\r\nand some half dozen or more seventeenth-century plank houses may yet\r\nbe seen north of Boston. Moreover, when the ship _Fortune_ sailed\r\nfrom Plymouth in the summer of 1621, the larger part of her lading\r\nconsisted of \"clapboards and wainscott,\" showing clearly that the\r\ncolonists soon after landing had dug saw pits and produced boards in\r\nquantity suitable for the construction of houses and for exportation.\r\n\r\n  [12] _Mourt's Relation_, Boston, 1841.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers in the Massachusetts Bay brought with them\r\nmechanics of all kinds, well equipped with tools, and it is\r\naltogether probable that these workmen plied their trades on this\r\nside of the Atlantic exactly as they had been taught through long\r\ncenturies of apprenticeship in England. The houses of that early\r\nperiod, still remaining, all resemble similar English structures.\r\nUpon arrival, however, the need for shelter was imperative, and\r\nall sorts of rude expedients were adopted. Deacon Bartholomew\r\nGreen, the printer of the _Boston News-Letter_, related that when\r\nhis father arrived at Boston in 1630, \"for lack of housing he was\r\nwont to find shelter at night in an empty cask,\" and during the\r\nfollowing winter many of the poorer sort still continued to live in\r\ntents through lack of better housing. When Roger Clap arrived at\r\nCharlestown in 1630 he \"found some Wigwams and one House ... in the\r\nmeantime before they could build at Boston, they lived many of them\r\nin tents and Wigwams.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Winthrop, in his _Journal_, writes that \"the poorer sort of\r\npeople (who lay long in tents) were much afflicted with scurvy and\r\nmany died, especially at Boston and Charlestown.\" He also makes\r\nseveral references to English wigwams. In September, 1630, one\r\nFitch, of Watertown, had his wigwam burned down with all his goods\r\nand two months later John Firman, also of Watertown, lost his\r\nEnglish wigwam.\r\n\r\nEdward Johnson, in his _Wonder-Working Providence_, mentions the\r\nrude shelters of the first settlers. \"They kept off the short\r\nshowers from their lodgings, but the long rains penetrated through\r\nto their disturbance in the night season, yet in those poor wigwams\r\nthey sang Psalms, praise and pray their God till they can provide\r\nthem homes which ordinarily was not wont to be with many till the\r\nearth by the Lord's blessing brought forth bread to feed them, their\r\nwives and little ones.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Francis Higginson, in his _New-Englands Plantation_,\r\nprinted in 1630, describes the wigwams built by the Indians living\r\nat Salem as \"verie little and homely, but made with small poles\r\nprick't into the ground and so bended and fastened at the tops and\r\non the side, they are matted with boughes and covered with sedge and\r\nold mats.\" It seems likely that when the English built themselves\r\n\"English wigwams,\" they copied the small structures built by the\r\nIndians, especially as mats suitable for covering might be obtained\r\nfrom the Indians by barter, and old pieces of sailcloth doubtless\r\nmight be obtained from the shipping stores. It seems unlikely that\r\nan Englishman living in one of these structures during the winter\r\nseason would be content to allow the smoke from his fire to find\r\nits way out through a hole in the roof in the Indian fashion. It\r\nis more likely that a fireplace, built of stones or bricks, would\r\nbe constructed at one end of an \"English wigwam.\" A door in hewed\r\nframe, with wooden hinges, probably was installed as a suitable\r\nsubstitute for the Indian mat lifted upon entering. The floors in\r\nthese English wigwams undoubtedly would be covered with rushes or\r\nstraw, following the custom in English cottages at that time.\r\n\r\nEdward Johnson, the town clerk of Woburn, writing in 1652, relates\r\nof the first settlers that \"after they have thus found out a place\r\nof aboad, they burrow themselves in the Earth for their first\r\nshelter under some Hill-side, casting the Earth aloft up on Timber:\r\nthey make a smoaky fire against the Earth at the highest side, and\r\nthus these poore servants of Christ provide shelter for themselves,\r\ntheir Wives and little ones.\"\r\n\r\nAlonzo Lewis, the historian of Lynn, writing a century ago, states\r\nthat some of the first settlers in that town made shelters for\r\nthemselves and families by digging caves into the hillsides. On\r\nthe bank of the Connecticut River above Hartford, is the Loomis\r\nInstitute, on the grounds of which is the site where the men from\r\nDorchester, Mass., in 1635, constructed their first dwellings, which\r\nwere dug into the river bank. The bank itself composed three walls\r\nof the shelter and the front was a framing of boards with a door and\r\na window. The roof was thatched with river sedge. The last of these\r\nlong abandoned dugouts was filled in as recently as 1926.\r\n\r\nAt Concord, Mass., the early settlers dug cellars in the earth which\r\nthey spanned with wooden spars and then covered with turf. A more\r\ndetailed description of such shelters is found in a report made in\r\n1650, by the Secretary of the Province of New Netherlands:\r\n\r\n\"Those in New Netherlands and especially in New England who have no\r\nmeans to build farmhouses at first, according to their wishes, dig\r\na square pit in the ground, cellar fashion, 6 or 7 feet deep, as\r\nlong and as broad as they think proper, case the earth inside with\r\nwood all round the wall, and line the wood with bark of trees or\r\nsomething else to prevent the caving in of the earth, floor this\r\ncellar with plank and wainscott it overhead for a ceiling, raise a\r\nroof of spars clear up and cover the spars with the bark or green\r\nsods, so that they can live dry and warm in these houses with their\r\nentire families for two, three or four years, it being understood\r\nthat partitions are run through those cellars which are adapted\r\nto the size of the family. The wealthy and principal men of New\r\nEngland, in the beginning of the Colonies, commenced their first\r\ndwelling houses in this fashion.\"[13]\r\n\r\n  [13] _Documentary History of New York_ (_1850_), Vol. I.\r\n\r\nThe frequent references to the English wigwam seem to indicate\r\nthat some such temporary construction was usual among many of the\r\ncolonists at the outset. Settlers were living at Salem as early\r\nas 1626 and Endecott, with a considerable immigration, arrived in\r\n1628. Marblehead, just across the harbor, was settled early and yet\r\nwhen John Goyt came there in 1637, he \"first built a wigwam and\r\nlived thar till he got a house.\"[14] The rude buildings also put\r\nup by planters at Salem must have been looked upon at the time as\r\ntemporary structures for they had all disappeared before 1661.[15]\r\n\r\n  [14] _Essex Co. (Mass.) Quarterly Court Records_, Vol. VI, p. 363.\r\n\r\n  [15] _Essex County Deeds_, Book V, leaf 107.\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Winthrop arrived at Charlestown in 1630 with the first\r\ngreat emigration, he found a house or two and several wigwams--rude\r\nshelters patterned after the huts built by the Indians--and until\r\nhouses could be erected in Boston many lived in tents and wigwams,\r\n\"their meeting-place being abroad under a Tree.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1623, Bradford mentions the \"building of great\r\nhouses in pleasant situations,\" and when a fire broke out in\r\nNovember of the following year it began in \"a shed yt was joyned to\r\nye end of ye storehouse, which was wattled up with bowes.\" It will\r\nbe seen that this shed was not crudely built of logs or slabs but\r\nthat its walls were wattled and perhaps also daubed with clay, in\r\nprecisely the same manner with which these colonists were familiar\r\nin their former homes across the sea. An original outer wall in the\r\nold Fairbanks house at Dedham, Massachusetts, still has its \"wattle\r\nand daub\" constructed in 1637.\r\n\r\nThomas Dudley writing to the Countess of Lincoln, in March, 1631,\r\nrelates: \"Wee have ordered that noe man shall build his chimney\r\nwith wood nor cover his house with thatch, which was readily\r\nassented unto, for that divers houses have been burned since our\r\narrival (the fire always beginning in the wooden chimneys) and some\r\nEnglish wigwams which have taken fire in the roofes with thatch or\r\nboughs.\"[16] It was Dudley who was taken to task by the Governor in\r\nMay, 1632, \"for bestowing so much cost on wainscotting his house and\r\notherwise adorning it,\" as it was not a good example for others in\r\nthe beginning of a plantation. Dudley replied that he had done it\r\nfor warmth and that it was but clapboards nailed to the walls. A few\r\nmonths later this house caught fire \"the hearth of the Hall chimney\r\nburning all night upon the principal beam.\"\r\n\r\n  [16] _Force's Tracts_, Washington, 1838.\r\n\r\nIn 1631, John Winthrop entered in his _Journal_ that the chimney\r\nof Mr. Sharp's house in Boston took fire \"the splinters being not\r\nclayed at the top\" and from it the thatch caught fire and the house\r\nwas burnt down.\r\n\r\nThe first meetinghouse built in Salem had a \"catted\" chimney, that\r\nis, the chimney was built with sticks laid cobhouse fashion and the\r\nwhole daubed with clay inside and out.\r\n\r\nThatch as a roof covering was in common use in the early days.\r\nNotwithstanding the Great and General Court forbade its use, it\r\nstill persisted as necessity arose. At the outset, towns along the\r\ncoastline set aside certain parts of thatch banks in the marshes,\r\nas a supply for thatching houses. Rye straw also was much used. The\r\nroofs of these thatched houses were not boarded as the thatch was\r\nfastened to slats. Dorchester built a meetinghouse in 1632 with a\r\nthatched roof.\r\n\r\nThe earliest frame houses were covered with weather-boarding and\r\nthis before long was covered with clapboards. The walls inside were\r\nsheathed up with boards moulded at the edges in an ornamental manner\r\nand the intervening space was filled with clay and chopped straw,\r\nand later with imperfect bricks. This was done for warmth, and was\r\nknown as \"nogging,\" following the English practice. When roofs were\r\nnot thatched, they were covered with shingles split from the log by\r\nmeans of a \"frow\" and afterwards hand-shaved. The window openings\r\nwere small and were closed by hinged casements, just as the houses\r\nin England were equipped at that time. Generally, the casement sash\r\nwas wood, but sometimes iron was used, as was common in England.\r\n\r\nThe glass was usually diamond-shaped, set in lead \"cames.\" Emigrants\r\nto Massachusetts were instructed by the Company to bring ample\r\nsupplies of glass for windows, but the supply ran short and in the\r\npoorer cottages and wigwams, oiled paper was in common use. This was\r\nan excellent substitute and supplied a surprisingly large amount of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nA brickyard was in operation in Salem as early as 1629, and\r\neverywhere along the coast clay was found and made up into bricks.\r\nChimneys were built upon a huge stone foundation. The brick work\r\nbegan at the first floor level and the bricks were laid in puddled\r\nclay up to about the ridge line where lime was used as the chimney\r\ntop became exposed to the weather.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed and denied that bricks used in the construction\r\nof certain old houses were brought from overseas. In general\r\nthe claims may be disregarded. It is certain, however, that the\r\nMassachusetts Company at the outset sent over ten thousand bricks,\r\nstowed in the ballast with five chauldrons of sea coals for the use\r\nof the blacksmiths. At the same time came iron and steel, nails, red\r\nlead, salt and sailcloth. Even fourteen hundred weight of plaster of\r\nparis, appears in the list, priced at eighteen shillings per hundred\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThe home of the average New Englander in the late seventeenth\r\ncentury was a wooden dwelling of two stories built around a brick\r\nchimney containing large fireplaces. In Rhode Island and in parts\r\nof Connecticut, where shale abounded, the chimney was built of\r\nstone and not infrequently the house, in whole or at one end, was\r\nalso so constructed. The roofs of these houses were covered with\r\nwooden shingles usually split from pine logs and shaved smooth by\r\nhand on a shingle horse. The outside walls of the well made house\r\nwere covered with clapboards, also smoothed on the shingle horse.\r\nFor many years these clapboards were made from oak, but as this\r\nwood has a tendency to warp and pull itself free from fastenings,\r\nby the year 1700, its use for that purpose had very generally been\r\nreplaced by pine. Outbuildings and the poorer class of dwellings\r\nwere not covered with clapboards or only the part next the road, for\r\nthe New Englander believes in \"putting his best foot forward.\" Such\r\nbuildings were covered with \"weatherboards\" or plain boarding that\r\nlapped at the lower edge.\r\n\r\nThe windows in these houses were filled by casement sash containing\r\nglass set in lead cames. The glass was usually diamond shaped, but\r\nsometimes four by six inch lights were used. This glass was imported\r\nfrom England and came packed in cribs, but much of it came in sheets\r\nalready leaded and was cut to size by \"glaziers\" upon demand. Early\r\nin the eighteenth century sliding-sash windows were introduced,\r\nprobably about 1710, but it was a long time before existing\r\ncasements were entirely given up. One Saturday afternoon in July,\r\n1714, lightning struck the house of Colonel Vetch in Boston. He had\r\nbought the dwelling not long before and Judge Sewall records in his\r\ndiary that at the time of the storm \"the Work of Transformation was\r\nnot finished\" to make the building fit for the occupancy of Madam\r\nVetch. The lightning played various tricks with the house, doing\r\nconsiderable damage, and among other details the Judge mentions\r\nthat it \"lifted up the Sash Window and broke one of the squares\" of\r\nglass.[17] Colonel Vetch was presumably a man of substance for he\r\nafterwards became Governor of Nova Scotia, and he is likely to have\r\n\"transformed\" his recently purchased house into the latest fashion\r\nof lighting.\r\n\r\n  [17] _Mass. Historical Society Colls._ (5th ser.), Vol. 7, p. 10.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Judge Sewall, the Chief Justice of the highest\r\ncourt in the Province, had casements in his Boston house at a time,\r\nten years later, when his daughter Hannah died, for he records in\r\nhis _Diary_ that \"Boston will not have her put into the Cellar [it\r\nwas in August when she died]; so she is only remov'd into the best\r\nRoom. And because the Casements were opened for Coolness, Boston\r\nwould watch all night.\" This entry in the ancient diary not only\r\npreserves the fact that the Judge's house had casement windows,\r\nbut it also makes allusion to the old-time custom of watching with\r\nthe dead body and the interest that the town of Boston had in the\r\nbereavement of the Judge.\r\n\r\nIn 1722, Benjamin Franklin in his Boston newspaper, was satirizing\r\nthe extravagancies of New England housewives in \"new Glazing their\r\nHouses with new fashion'd square Glass.\" Diamond glass had seen its\r\nday, however, and forty years later \"Windows set in lead, suitable\r\nfor Hot-Beds\" were advertised in the newspapers, a sure sign of\r\ndiscarded sash. On the other hand, a hardware shop was advertising\r\n\"sheet and diamond glass\" as late as 1766, probably to meet the\r\ndemands for repairing old casements.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of these early houses was seldom painted, in fact it\r\nwas well into the nineteenth century before the outside of houses in\r\ncountry towns were usually painted. A diarist who rode into Boston\r\nin 1804 comments on the dingy appearance of the houses and the\r\ngeneral lack of paint and about the same time a Salem man met with\r\nsuccess in business, whereupon he painted his house with the result\r\nthat his associates rather sneeringly remarked: \"Sam is feeling his\r\noats; he's begun to paint his house.\"\r\n\r\nThe paint first used on the exteriors of New England houses was\r\nusually of a dark red color called, both then and now, \"Indian red.\"\r\nRed ochre was used and commonly was mixed with fish oil. The Indians\r\nhad \"paint mines\" where they had found red earth and doubtless these\r\n\"mines\" were utilized, particularly in adjacent locations. One of\r\nthese paint mines was located near what is now Augusta, Maine, and\r\nin that part of New England formerly existed, long before the coming\r\nof the European, an Indian race that used this red earth so freely\r\nthat by ethnologists it has been termed the \"red paint culture.\"\r\n\r\nSo runs the present-day tradition of Indian red in New England. In\r\npoint of fact, however, red earth was brought from the East Indies\r\nlong before the settlement of the American Colonies, hence the name\r\n\"India red,\" by which it was advertised in the Boston newspapers in\r\nthe mid-eighteenth century. In 1766, John Gore, \"at his Shop at the\r\nSign of the Painter's Arms in Queen Street,\" Boston, advertised a\r\nstock of oils, paints, brushes, etc., just imported from London. He\r\nhad linseed oil by the barrel or smaller quantity, boiled oil, nut\r\noil, turpentine oil and turpentine varnish. Among his white colors,\r\nwere Spanish white and French halk,--whatever that may be. Red was\r\na color that was in demand for he carried red head, Spanish brown,\r\nIndia red, purple red, Venetian red, Vermillian, drop hake, carmine,\r\number and rose pink. Under yellows, he listed King's yellow,\r\nPrincess yellow, Naples yellow, spruce yellow, stone yellow, English\r\nochre, Orpiment-pale and deep, Dutch pink and brown pink. The blues\r\nwere ultramarine, ultramarine ashes, Prussian blue of various sorts,\r\ncalcined smalt, strowing ditto, verditer blue and powder blue.\r\n\r\nGore also sold crayons in sets and canvas for portrait painting in\r\nhalf-length cloths, kit-kat and three-quarters length. He carried\r\n\"Colours prepared for House and Ship Painting,\" best London crown\r\nglass for pictures and \"Water Colours ready prepared in Shells.\"[18]\r\n\r\n  [18] _Boston News-Letter_, Jan. 23, 1766.\r\n\r\nTwo years later he advertised chariot glasses, genteel\r\nlooking-glasses and Wilton carpets and also announced that he did\r\ncoach and carpet painting in the best and cheapest manner.\r\n\r\nAt how early a date was paint used on the exterior of a New England\r\nhouse? Who can solve the problem? Undoubtedly it was on a house\r\nowned by some merchant having a direct contact with England. It is\r\nan established fact that the Andrews house, built in 1707-1710, in\r\nthe country town of Topsfield, Mass., was painted Indian red at the\r\ntime it was built, or soon after, but only on the trim--the window\r\nframes, corner boards, etc. The clapboards and weather-boarding at\r\nthe easterly end, remained unpainted until long years after.\r\n\r\nThe inside finish of town houses owned by well-to-do people,\r\nprobably was painted at a comparatively early date, at least, one\r\nor two rooms in a house. \"A large Fashionable Dwelling-House\" in\r\nBoston, \"about 1-1/4 miles from Charlestown ferry\" was advertised to\r\nbe sold in 1734. It had eight \"fire rooms\"--that is, rooms with\r\nfireplaces. The entries and two of the rooms were \"beautifully\r\nWainscotted and laid in oil\" and four were \"handsomely Painted.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1753, George Tilley, a Boston shop keeper, advertised his house\r\nfor sale. It contained \"eight rooms, seven of them fire-rooms,\r\nwith a Number of convenient Closets and a good Cellar, four of\r\nthe said Rooms is cornish'd, and the House is handsomely painted\r\nthroughout; one of the Rooms is painted Green, another Blue, one\r\nCedar and one Marble; the other four a Lead colour, the Garrets are\r\nhandsomely plaistered; the House has twenty Sash-Windows to it and\r\nis pleasantly situated on Pleasant Street, near the Hay-Market.\"[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] _Boston News-Letter_, Sept. 13, 1753.\r\n\r\nBut such glory did not exist in other parts of the same town and\r\ncertainly not in the country. Rufus Choate, the lawyer, was born\r\nin a house in Essex, Mass., built in 1725 by an ancestor who was\r\npopularly called \"Governor Choate.\" He was a man in comfortable\r\ncircumstances and built for himself a house of ten rooms having\r\ngood panelling in four of them. None of the finish on this house\r\nwas painted until well after 1825 or a century after it was built.\r\nThis paint has now been removed and the old white pine finish is\r\nrevealed in all its natural beauty of varying shades of reddish\r\nbrown, effectively contrasting with the whitewashed walls. Natural\r\nwood finish, laid in oil, was quite the common thing in the ordinary\r\nNew England dwelling, until after the people had recovered from the\r\nfinancial exhaustion of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe plastered walls were usually whitewashed which was quite in\r\nkeeping with the Puritan character that covered with limewash\r\nthe beautiful mural decorations of the English churches at the\r\ntime of the Commonwealth. Families of wealth covered their walls\r\nwith hangings brought from England. Peter Sergeant died in 1714,\r\npossessed of a \"suit of Imagery Tapestry hangings\" in his cedar\r\nroom. This house was one of the finest in the town of Boston\r\nand afterwards became the Province House,--the residence of the\r\nGovernors of the Province. Another room in this house was also\r\nfurnished with hangings. Arras hangings were advertised from time\r\nto time in the Boston newspapers and in 1736, Boydell, the printer\r\nof the _Boston Gazette_, advertised a house in which one chamber in\r\nthe first story was \"hung with Scotch Tapestry, the other with Green\r\ncheny.\" The large brick house of the late Isaac Gridley, situated\r\nnear Fort Hill, in Boston, was sold in 1771. It contained thirteen\r\nrooms and three of the lower rooms were \"genteelly furnished with\r\nTapestry Hangings.\"\r\n\r\nA three-story house was built in Boston about 1715 by William\r\nClark, a wealthy merchant and member of the governor's council.\r\nHis death in 1742, was attributed by some, to the loss of forty\r\nsail of vessels in the French War. In this house afterwards lived\r\nSir Henry Frankland, Collector of the Port, who fell in love with\r\nAgnes Surriage, the beautiful sixteen-year-old maid-of-all-work at\r\nthe Fountain Inn in Marblehead. Her romantic story is well-known.\r\nThis house differed but little from the dozen or so of its type\r\nto be found in Boston at the time, save in its rich and elaborate\r\ndecoration of the north parlor, at the right of the entrance hall.\r\nHere, the walls were divided into panels by fluted pilasters\r\nsupporting an elaborate cornice, the whole heavily gilded, and each\r\nof the panels was embellished with a landscape or other decoration\r\npainted in oils. Painted arabesques and heraldic devices covered all\r\nother flat surfaces and the floor was laid in a mosaic of various\r\ncolored woods. Every inch of the surface of this parlor was the\r\nproduct of the imagination and skill of the painter, gilder or\r\ncarver. But while this magnificence actually existed in New England,\r\nby no means was it typically representative of its culture or\r\nartistic development. It merely exhibited the pride of wealth and\r\nwas largely the product of European craftsmen.\r\n\r\nThe heavy strap hinges on the doors of the earlier houses and\r\nbuildings were probably wrought by hand at the forge of the nearest\r\nblacksmith, but most of the hardware and iron work was imported\r\nfrom England. Before 1650 there was a slitting mill at the Saugus\r\nIron Works, but the principal product of this forge was cast iron\r\nmanufactures, such as pots and kettles. At a later date, Parliament,\r\nat the instigation of the English manufacturers, prohibited by law\r\nthe setting up of slitting mills and trip hammers, and it naturally\r\nfollowed that the manufactured iron and brass required by the\r\nColonies was brought overseas from Birmingham and Sheffield.\r\n\r\nA word or two as to the varying types of house hardware may not be\r\namiss at this time. At the outset wooden hinges and heavy strap\r\nhinges of wrought iron were in common use. These hinges were hung\r\non gudgeons and their points varied in design but the spear-shaped\r\npoint was most common. In the best houses, at an early date and\r\ncontinuing until the beginning of the eighteenth century, might be\r\nfound the so-called \"cock's head\" hinge, an ornamental survival\r\nfrom Roman times. The butterfly hinge was also in use at that\r\ntime--usually on cupboards and furniture doors. The =H= and =HL=\r\nhinges came into use in New England in the early 1700's and lasted\r\nuntil after the Revolution. These hinges were cut out of heavy sheet\r\niron and were made in factories in England. This type of hinge was\r\nsuperseded by the cast-iron butt, still in use, which was invented\r\nin England in 1775, and adopted very generally in the United States\r\nat the close of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn some old houses that have been restored and in many modern\r\nconstructions done in the manner of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies, the door hinges in painted rooms have been picked out in\r\nblack making them most conspicuous. This is a modern conceit--an\r\ninvention of the modern architect. It was not done in the old days,\r\na fact easily established by carefully scraping through the various\r\ncoats of paint on an old house. Our great-great-grandmothers had\r\nno itching desire for contrasts of that sort. They knew nothing of\r\nhighboys, grandfather's clocks, low daddys, Lady Washington chairs,\r\ncourting mirrors, fiddle back chairs or donkey-eared spindle backs.\r\nThese names are inventions of collectors or antique dealers striving\r\nfor the picturesque. The highboy, it is true, antedates the others,\r\nbut in the early days this piece of furniture was called a high\r\nchest of drawers and the lowboy was called a low chest. Recently\r\nthe common =HL= hinge has been described as the \"Holy Land\" hinge;\r\ncertainly not referring to the English colonies where there were\r\nfully as many sinners as saints.\r\n\r\nWooden latches were used on both outside and inside doors in early\r\ndays and the wooden latch persisted in the back country until\r\ncomparatively recent times. The iron thumb latch was made by the\r\ncountry blacksmith but more and more it came to be imported from\r\nEngland. The earliest type has spear-point handles. The rounded end\r\ncomes in after 1700 and is common about 1750. The Norfolk latch,\r\nin brass and iron, comes in after the Revolution and was replaced\r\nby the common cast-iron thumb latch, invented by Blake in 1840. In\r\nexamining old hinges and all kinds of hardware always have in mind\r\nthat the machine-made pointed screw was not invented until 1846.\r\n\r\nA feature of this hardware trade with England, which is of much\r\ninterest, is the catalogues that were sent over by the manufacturers\r\nin Birmingham. About the year 1770 they began to send out drawings\r\nof different pieces of hardware, tools, etc., and this soon\r\ndeveloped into sheets of engravings on copper which were bound into\r\nbooks and sent to customers at a distance who then could visualize\r\nthe goods and order accordingly; size, list price and discount were\r\nindicated. Seldom was there a title-page or even a label to indicate\r\na source, but the handmade paper bears its watermark and generally\r\nthe date when it was made. These catalogues are now difficult to\r\nfind and the Victoria and Albert Museum at South Kensington, esteems\r\nthem so highly that a descriptive catalogue of its collection has\r\nbeen published. Probably the largest collection of these catalogues\r\nin America is in the library of the Essex Institute at Salem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHOW THEY FURNISHED THEIR HOUSES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a lamentable fact that the present generation possesses\r\nlittle accurate information on the every day life and surroundings\r\nof the early settlers in Massachusetts. Some of the finer pieces\r\nof furniture have been preserved together with a few portraits and\r\npieces of silver and here and there an article of costume of special\r\nbeauty or unusual association. The newly settled country had no\r\nartists to paint pictures of household interiors in the manner of\r\nthe Dutch painters and the diarists and letter writers of that time\r\nwhen they used a quill pen, devoted little thought to the homely\r\nhappenings of the household or to the costume and furniture with\r\nwhich every one was familiar. Judge Samuel Sewall's diary[20] throws\r\nmuch light on New England life two centuries and more ago, but many\r\nare the questions we would like to ask. In August, 1702, he rode to\r\nNewbury to attend the funeral of his sister Mehitable and returned\r\nhome by way of Andover where he found that the keeper of the\r\nordinary was sick and so went to Mr. Woodman's daughters \"and there\r\ndin'd on Pork and Beans; afterward had Fowls rosted and dress'd very\r\nwell.\" It would be interesting if we could know more about that\r\ndinner. Did the Judge eat in the same room in which the fowls were\r\n\"rosted\" and was the table furnished with woodenware or pewter,\r\nor both? Had the Woodmans begun to use two-tined forks or did the\r\nJudge hold the meat in one hand while he cut it up and conveyed it\r\nto his mouth with the knife? Was a roasting jack fastened over the\r\nfireplace? Was the dinner served on a table-board? Did all stand\r\nwhile \"a blessing\" was asked? What was served for dessert? Did the\r\nJudge wash his hands at the washbench in the kitchen and if not,\r\nwhere did he find the washbasin? What pictures were on the parlor\r\nwalls and was there a bedstead in the corner and if so, how was it\r\nfurnished and how made? A bedstead known to have been used in a\r\nNew England house of 1702 is almost unknown today. If the Judge had\r\nonly devoted five minutes, while writing up his diary, to a close\r\ndescription of that bedstead and its furnishings he would have\r\nsettled many existing doubts.\r\n\r\n  [20] _Mass. Historical Society Colls._ (5th ser.), Vols. 5-7.\r\n\r\nIt seems entirely reasonable that a distinguished guest in the house\r\nwould not be required in the morning to go to the washbench in the\r\nkitchen and use the family basin. The dignity of Judge Sewall and\r\nthe delicacy of Madam Belcher would rebel at the thought of an\r\nexhibition of disheveled attire before the serving maid and the\r\nnumerous children of the family. In the humblest home, on occasion,\r\nit would be a simple matter to place in the chamber of a guest, on a\r\ntable or even on a chair, a basin and a jug of water with a towel.\r\n\r\nIn the journal of the travels of Dr. Alexander Hamilton of\r\nAnnapolis, Md., who rode through New England in 1744, may be found\r\nthe description of the furnishings of a chamber in an inn. Doctor\r\nHamilton was accompanied by a negro servant and on a Sunday morning\r\nat Marblehead he asked for his portmanteau. \"I was told by my man\r\nDromo that it was in his room. I had the curiosity to go and see\r\nwhat kind of a room his room was, and upon a reconnoitre found it a\r\nmost spacious one, furnished _a la mode de Cabaret_, with tables,\r\nchairs, a fine feather-bed with quilted counterpane, white calico\r\ncanopy, or tester, and curtains, every way adapted for a gentleman\r\nof his degree and complexion.\"\r\n\r\nOf course 1744 is many years after the period when oak furniture was\r\ncommonly in use; yet Reid's tavern, \"at the sign of the Dragon,\" in\r\nthe fishing village of Marblehead, could not have been the resort of\r\nfashion or wealth and if a negro slave was given so well furnished a\r\nchamber what may have been the furnishings of the chamber occupied\r\nby Doctor Hamilton?\r\n\r\nIn a farmer's family, in the early days, it was undoubtedly the\r\nhabit to wash faces and hands in a small tub or keeler on the\r\nwashbench in the kitchen. In suitable weather it is altogether\r\nlikely the men of the family may have washed out of doors, beside\r\nthe back door, in a bucket of water freshly drawn from the well\r\nor brought from the spring. The farm hands, on coming in from the\r\nfields, for dinner, or at night, always \"washed up\" at a bench out\r\nof doors and this custom persisted until well into the nineteenth\r\ncentury. My mother, when young, for a time lived on a farm (about\r\n1850) and several times I have heard her describe the farm hand who\r\ncame to the back door one noon, and looking at his hands remarked,\r\n\"I guess they are clean enough,\" and so went into his dinner,\r\nwithout washing.\r\n\r\nHenry W. Erving of Hartford, Conn., writes: \"A couple of years ago I\r\nmade a pilgrimage to my great-grandfather's former home in Westford,\r\nConn., in company with a kinsman over eighty years old--the last of\r\nhis generation. It was a very comfortable house, with four rooms and\r\na leanto, with a stone chimney. My great-grandfather lived there as\r\nearly as 1750. My cousin called my attention to the old well near\r\nthe door where, by the curb, there was a large stone hollowed out\r\nlike a trough. He said the 'men folks' as they came from the field,\r\nwould fill that trough with a bucket or two of water from which\r\nthey would 'souse' themselves thoroughly, thus not disturbing the\r\ngoodwife. And of course in the rustic neighborhoods the old customs\r\nexisted long after they were abandoned in the larger villages and\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\n\"You will hardly believe, when I say it, but I distinctly remember\r\nas a very small boy, going to a house in this same primitive town of\r\nWestford where we were invited to dinner. The only drinking vessel\r\non the table was one of the quart Staffordshire mugs (would that I\r\nhad that mug in my collection today) which was filled with water,\r\nmilk or cider, I have really forgotten which, and passed around the\r\ntable at the demand of any thirsty one. The family consisted of\r\na man and his wife, an ancient grandmother, and several children\r\nwith not too clean faces. I couldn't refuse the mug when urged upon\r\nme and selecting a place on the brim at the right of the handle,\r\nI drank, when one of the children exclaimed, 'See, mar! He's got\r\ngranny's place.' Of course that practice in this instance was\r\npossibly nearly a century out of period.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the standard examples of American humor is the picture of the\r\n_Mayflower_ loaded to the cross-trees with the chairs, chests and\r\ncradles that devout New Englanders now own and claim were brought\r\nover on that memorable voyage. It is so easy to attribute age and\r\nromantic history to a treasured family relic that it has become\r\npossible for a museum in the city of New York to exhibit a punch\r\nbowl of Staffordshire ware, as a veritable relic of the _Mayflower_.\r\nThe bowl could not possibly have been made before 1780-1790. There\r\nis another piece of Staffordshire treasured in the china closet\r\nof a New England family, which the owner is certain was formerly\r\npossessed by an ancestress who died years before the Revolution.\r\nWell authenticated family tradition vouches for the fact which\r\ncannot be disputed. Yet, the observer will soon discover a steamboat\r\npictured on one side of the pitcher and what is more interesting,\r\nthe stars and stripes are flying from the masthead and the canton of\r\nthe flag contains fifteen stars.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly true that some pieces of furniture were brought\r\nover from England by the first settlers and the tradition connected\r\nwith such pieces can be authenticated by an examination of the\r\nchair or chest showing that it is made of English and not American\r\noak. While most family possessions, for convenience in shipment,\r\ncame over in bales or bundles, covered with canvas in the true\r\nEuropean manner, a custom followed by emigrants of a later day,\r\nyet, many articles of fine clothing and the treasured belongings of\r\nthe better-equipped families came over neatly stowed in chests and\r\ncupboards and some of those chests have survived.\r\n\r\nIt is all a matter of common sense reasoning which can be backed\r\nup by an examination of early records and also the furniture\r\nitself. Why pay a considerable value in money to transport, in an\r\novercrowded ship, utilitarian pieces of furniture, that could be\r\nmade in the newly settled colony, by workmen who were going over in\r\nthe same ship? Timber could be had here for the cutting and until\r\nsufficient time had elapsed to permit the making of chairs, beds and\r\nother required furniture, one could sit on rudely made stools and\r\nboxes and sleep on pallet beds made up on the floor just as many of\r\nthem would be obliged to sleep while on board ship.\r\n\r\nSome estimate of the culture of the New England people during the\r\nseventeenth century and of their appreciation of the refinements of\r\nlife may be reached with a degree of accuracy through a study of\r\nthe carefully itemized inventories of their estates made at time of\r\ndeath. During that period the Royal Governor from overseas, with\r\nhis little court of officials and followers, had not introduced\r\nLondon fashions and furnishings to the extent that existed in the\r\neighteenth century. Moreover, the wealth of the colonies had not\r\ngrown to the point where the refinements of life were not only\r\nesteemed but demanded by loving spouses and by those who had taken\r\nship for England or the Continent and there had observed how other\r\npeople lived.\r\n\r\nAmong the early settlements made in the Colony of the Massachusetts\r\nBay was one at Agawam, now the town of Ipswich. The news had reached\r\nBoston that the French were pushing their settlements westward along\r\nthe coast, bringing with them \"divers priests and Jesuits,\" which\r\nso alarmed the Governor and the Assistants that it was decided to\r\nforestall the French and hasten the planting of new towns north\r\nof Boston. The first move was to send the Governor's son John,\r\nwith twelve others, to establish themselves at Agawam. There were\r\nno roads and so they sailed along the coast in a shallop and took\r\npossession of the town site in March, 1633. Their families and other\r\nsettlers soon followed and the increase of population was such that\r\nin August, 1634, the Court of Assistants decreed that the place be\r\ncalled Ipswich, after old Ipswich in England, \"in acknowledgment of\r\nthe great honor and kindness done to our people, who took shipping\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nThree months later, in November, 1634, one John Dillingham arrived\r\nin Ipswich and the selectmen granted him six acres of land on which\r\nto build a house. He was from Leicestershire and with his wife and\r\ndaughter had come over in the fleet with Winthrop in 1630, and\r\nremained in Boston until he removed to Ipswich. Life in the frontier\r\nsettlement was too severe for him and he died during the next\r\nwinter. On July 14, 1636, his widow, Sarah, made her \"last will and\r\ntestament\" being in \"perfect memory though my body be weake & sick\"\r\nand a few days later she too was dead, leaving her orphaned daughter\r\nto be cared for by Richard Saltonstall and John Appleton, under the\r\ndirection of the Quarterly Court. And this was not at all difficult\r\nfor John Dillingham had left a \"goodly estate,\" for the times. This\r\nDillingham home has been selected for analysis because it is one\r\nof the earliest estates in the Colony of which we have exact and\r\ndetailed information, a number of documents relating to it having\r\nbeen preserved among the miscellaneous papers in the Massachusetts\r\nState Archives.[21] Moreover, it shows the furnishings and equipment\r\nof a settler living in a town of only two years growth from the\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n  [21] _Mass. Historical Society Colls._ (5th ser.), Vols. 5-7.\r\n\r\nThe Dillingham homestead consisted of a house of two rooms and\r\noutbuildings with thirty acres of upland, sixty acres of meadow,\r\ni.e., grass land, and six acres of planting ground near the house,\r\nof which four acres were planted with corn. Apple trees and other\r\nfruits were fenced off in the garden. For livestock there was\r\na mare, three cows, two steers, two heifers, four calves, and\r\nfour pigs. There was an indentured servant, Thomas Downs, to\r\nhelp cultivate the land and care for the stock, and a maid, Ann\r\nTowle, who not only helped with the housework but also worked in\r\nthe fields. \"She hath been a faithful servant,\" wrote Richard\r\nSaltonstall, executor of the estate, \"and though she was discharged\r\nby her mistress a little before her time was out, yet it may be\r\nborne by the estate, considering her diligence.\" Ann had come over\r\nin the ship _Susan and Ellen_, which arrived in April, 1635. Her\r\npassage cost £5.\r\n\r\nThe Dillinghams occupied a good social position in the youthful\r\nsettlement but their two-room house did not contain any really\r\nfine furniture. The parlor was also used as a bedroom, a practice\r\nwhich was common everywhere in the seventeenth century. It had two\r\nbedsteads valued at £1. 6. 8.; a cupboard, 10s.; a sea chest, 10s.;\r\ntwo \"joyned Chaires,\" 5s.; a round table, 7s.; a deske, 4s.; and\r\na band box, 2s. There was also a large nest of boxes valued £2.\r\nand a small nest of boxes worth only three shillings. The feather\r\nbeds, boulsters, and pillows on each bed were valued at about\r\ntwice as much as a bedstead and the coverlets averaged about £1.\r\na piece. There were flaxen sheets for Mrs. Dillingham's bed and\r\ncoarse sheets for the beds of the maid and the indentured servant. A\r\nwarming pan bears silent testimony to the cold of the winter season.\r\nAnother bedstead valued at only three shillings may have been in\r\nthe garret and occupied by Ann Towle, the maid. A chest stood in\r\nthe kitchen--more generally spoken of at that time as \"the hall,\"\r\nin accordance with the English usage--and two boxes, probably used\r\nfor storage and also for seats. That was all the furniture listed in\r\nthe kitchen that was considered of any value. The tables, stools,\r\nbenches, shelving, or other furnishings seemingly necessary to\r\nhousekeeping at that time either did not exist or were so crude in\r\nconstruction as to have little or no value in estimating the estate.\r\nWe find five cushions, however, valued at fifteen shillings.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dillingham died possessed of a few really fine\r\nfurnishings--possibly treasured ancestral pieces--for she bequeathed\r\na silver bowl to the wife of Richard Saltonstall, and to the wife\r\nof John Appleton she gave a silver porringer. It would be extremely\r\ninteresting today to know what has become of these two pieces of\r\nColonial silver. No other silver is mentioned but on shelving in the\r\nkitchen rested 40-1/2 pounds of pewter valued at £2. 14. 0. As a pewter\r\nplate of the time weighs nearly two pounds and a platter much more\r\nthe supply of pewter for the table was not large. Wooden plates,\r\ntrenchers, and bowls are not mentioned, but there were twenty-five\r\npewter saucers, six porringers, seven spoons, and five shillings\r\nworth of knives. As for table forks, they were practically unknown\r\nin the Colony at that time. Governor Winthrop brought over a fork\r\nin 1630, carefully preserved in a case, which is supposed to be the\r\nfirst and only table fork in the Colony in the earliest days of the\r\nsettlements. Knives, spoons, and fingers, with plenty of napery, met\r\nthe demands of table manners in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe large fireplace in the kitchen had its usual equipment of\r\npot-hooks, fire shovel and tongs, gridiron, trivet, and bellows,\r\nand beside it was an old dark lantern valued at only two shillings.\r\nThere were iron pots, kettles, skillets and ladles; a brass pot and\r\na mortar. There was a frying-pan with a hole in it and in a box were\r\nkept \"bullets, hinges and other smale things.\" Two beer vessels were\r\nlisted; a case of bottles, two jugs, three pans, a tray, and two\r\nbaskets. Such was the simple equipment of the Dillingham kitchen.\r\nThere were plenty of table-cloths and napkins but no curtains at\r\nany of the windows. If a broom were used it probably was made of\r\nbirch twigs bound together around a long handle. Candlesticks do\r\nnot appear in the inventory and the only store of food mentioned\r\n(aside from twenty-one new cheeses valued at £2. 16. 0.) was seven\r\nbushels of rye, two firkins and a half of butter, a half bushel of\r\nmalt, six pounds of raisins, and some spice. Our ancestors had a\r\nhighly developed appreciation of the value of condiments. In a Salem\r\ninventory at a somewhat later date appear salt, pepper, ginger,\r\ncloves, mace, cinnamon, nutmegs, and allspice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dillingham's wearing apparel unfortunately is not listed item\r\nby item, but given a total value of £5. 8. 4. Her linen amounted\r\nto an almost equal sum. Some of her deceased husband's clothing is\r\nincluded in the inventory, such as a coat with silver buttons, a\r\nred waistcoat, a suit of serge and a black suit of serge unmade, a\r\njacket of cloth, and an old suit and cloak. Little Sara Dillingham,\r\nthe orphaned child, when sent to school to goodwife Symonds was\r\nsupplied with \"a stuffe petticoat & waskote\" and four \"shifts with\r\nshewes\"; also a gown that cost £2. 10s. Perhaps after a time she may\r\nhave been able to read and fully appreciate the books formerly in\r\nher loving father's chest. They were: \"Perkins works in 3 volumes,\r\nSeaven Treatises bound in 2 volumes, the Spowse Royall, the bruised\r\nreade, & a little new testiment.\"\r\n\r\nSix years later, in 1642, there died in the same town, Richard\r\nLumpkin, who had emigrated from Boxted, in Essex, and became an\r\ninfluential citizen in the new town in the new county of Essex. He\r\nwas elected a representative to the Great and General Court and was\r\ndeacon of the Ipswich church at the time of his death. He left an\r\nestate valued at £300. In the hall of his house stood a long table,\r\nwith two forms and a stool beside it, having a total value of only\r\nfifteen shillings. The hall also contained three chairs and six\r\ncushions valued at four shillings. That was all the furniture in the\r\nroom that was of any value. There were books, however, valued at £2.\r\n10. 0., a musket and a fowling piece and other small furnishings.\r\nIn the parlor was a table with six joined stools, three chairs and\r\neight cushions, a bedstead, and a trundle bed with curtains, and a\r\nchest, the latter valued at only four shillings. In the chamber over\r\nthe parlor was a bedstead with its trundle bed, a table valued at\r\nthree shillings, four chests and two boxes; not a chair or stool is\r\nnamed in connection with the room. The kitchen was in the leanto and\r\nwhile it contained a good supply of brass and iron pots and kettles\r\nand also pewter dishes, the table, bench, stools and wooden plates,\r\netc., that must have been in the room were of so little value that\r\nthey do not appear in the inventory.\r\n\r\nIt is when we meet with joined and wainscot chests and court,\r\nlivery, and standing cupboards that we find pieces that may have\r\nbeen brought from overseas. When Mr. Thomas Millard of Newbury\r\n(note the title of honor), died in 1653, he possessed a wainscot\r\ncupboard, table, chairs and stools. He also left behind him three\r\nsilver spoons, a silver cup, and a silver salt seller, and among the\r\nkitchen utensils were tinned pudding pans, a brazen chaffing dish\r\nand a lanthorn and lamp made of latin ware.\r\n\r\nThe widow of the Rev. Jose Glover married, in 1641, Henry Dunster,\r\nPresident of Harvard College. Among the furnishings of her house\r\nwere \"eleven featherbeds or downe ... one of them haveing philop and\r\nCheny curtaines in graine with a deep silke fringe on the vallance,\r\nand a smaller on the Curtaines, and a Coverlett sutable to it, made\r\nof Red Kersie, and laced with a greene lace, round the sides and\r\n2 downe the middle, also ... an outlandish quilt, also to another\r\na blue serdge suite very rich and costly, curtaines and valances\r\nlaced, and fringe, and a blue Rug to the bed, also a greene sute in\r\nthe same manner, also another red wrought suite, with a sheet and\r\nall things Compleate, also a Canopie bed, with Curtenes, a Chest of\r\nDrawers of part of this Chest was filled with rich lenen a dammeske\r\nsuite seuerall diepere suits a fine hollen[d] suit with a stech:\r\nwith abundance of flaxen linen for Common use, in another parte of\r\nthe chest of drawers tape, tafety for Chaire and Stooles ... also\r\n29 siluer spones a very faire salt with 3 full knops on the top of\r\nit[22] 3 other siluer salts of lesser sorts a great siluer trunke\r\nwith 4 knop to stand on the table and with suger: 6 porrengers, one\r\nsmall one: 3 bere boules 4 wine cups a siluer grate with a Couer on\r\nit: 6 siluer trencher plates: also blankets and Coverletts and Rugs\r\neuery[way] Compleat to furnish so many beds.\"[23]\r\n\r\n  [22] This large salt is now owned by Harvard College.\r\n\r\n  [23] _Old-Time New England_, July, 1934.\r\n\r\nBy way of contrast let us glance at the inventory of the possessions\r\nof William Googe of Lynn, who died in 1646, ten years after Mrs.\r\nDillingham had willed that her body be \"decently buyried\" and her\r\nchild \"religiously educated if God give it life.\" Googe left a house\r\nand twelve acres of land and the total value of his possessions\r\namounted to but £28. 11. 7, with debts of £4. 9. 7. He left a\r\nwidow and three small children, and though dying in very lowly\r\ncircumstances he may have known better times, for John Mascoll, the\r\nservant of Mr. Googe of Lynn, was fined in 1643, for neglecting the\r\nwatch. The title of honor, \"Mr.,\" was used but sparingly in those\r\nearly days and usually indicated a degree of social standing in the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nGooge had been a soldier, for among his personal belongings at death\r\nwere a sword and belt, a musket and bandoleers, and also gunpowder.\r\nOne cow and four hogs comprised his entire livestock, and five\r\nbushels of wheat, ten bushels of Indian corn, and flax in the bundle\r\nlay in the garret of his house, which was frugally furnished with\r\na chest, a chair, an old chair, a stool, and a trunk. The family\r\nprobably slept on pallet beds made up on the floor, for bedding\r\nis listed but no bedsteads. They had a frying pan, a gridiron, a\r\nskillet, a posnet, an earthen pot, six spoons, and the following\r\nwoodenware, viz.: \"3 wood trayes & 3 wood boules & 3 wood dishes,\r\n1s. 9d.; one runlitt, 1s.; paieles & tubs, 3s.\" Two bags valued at\r\ntwo shillings bring to a close the list of the earthly possessions\r\nof William Googe of Lynn. When the inventory was brought into court\r\nit very properly gave the goods to the widow \"for the bringing up of\r\nher three small children.\" So reads the record.\r\n\r\nDoubtless there were many families in the Colony little better\r\nconditioned, judging from the relatively small number of estates\r\nsettled through the courts when compared with the deaths and\r\nestimated population.\r\n\r\nGooge's house and twelve acres of land were valued at only £8. This\r\nmust have been a very simple, thatch-roofed house of not more than\r\ntwo rooms, comparable with the outlying farmhouse of Jacob Perkins\r\nthat was burned in Ipswich in 1668. And thereby hangs a tale. Master\r\nPerkins and his wife had gone to town one summer afternoon leaving\r\nthe house in charge of Mehitable Brabrooke, a sixteen-year-old\r\nserving maid. We will let the ancient document in the court files\r\nrelate what happened.\r\n\r\n\"About 2 or 3 aclocke in the afternoone she was taking tobacco in a\r\npipe and went out of the house with her pipe and gott upon the oven\r\non the outside & backside of the house (to looke if there were any\r\nhogs in the corne) and she layed her right hand upon the thatch of\r\nthe house (to stay herselfe) and with her left hand knocked out her\r\npipe over her right arme upon the thatch on the eaves of the house\r\n(not thinking there had been any fire in the pipe) and imediately\r\nwent downe into the corne feild to drive out the hogs she saw in it,\r\nand as she was going toward the railes of the feild ... she looked\r\nback, and saw a smoke upon her Mistress' house in the place where\r\nshe had knocked out her pipe at which shee was much frighted.\"[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] _Essex County Quarterly Court Records_, Vol. IV, pp. 56-57.\r\n\r\nThe wife of a neighbor came running to the assistance of Mehitable\r\nand afterwards testified that when she reached the house she looked\r\ninto both fireplaces and saw no appearance of fire, only a few\r\nbrands nearly dead under a great kettle hanging in the chimney. She\r\nalso looked up into the chamber through the floor boards that lay\r\nvery open on the side where the smoke was.\r\n\r\nCould photographs more vividly picture the scene? The thatch-roofed\r\nfarmhouse had two rooms on the ground floor and a chimney with\r\ntwo fireplaces. An oven was built on the backside probably having\r\nan opening inside the kitchen fireplace in the usual manner. The\r\nhouse was of but one story judging from the low roof that the maid\r\nwas able to reach when standing on the oven, and the floor of the\r\nchamber in the loft had wide cracks between the boards so that it\r\nwas possible to look through from below and see the under side of\r\nthe roof. In similar homes lived many a family in the early days in\r\ncomparative comfort.\r\n\r\nAs for the careless Mehitable, she was brought before the Quarterly\r\nCourt on suspicion of wilfully setting the house on fire; a serious\r\noffence, which as late as 1821, was the cause of the execution in\r\nSalem of a sixteen-year-old boy. Among those who deposed at her\r\ntrial was a young man who said that as he and she were going into\r\nthe meadow, before the fire, to make hay, she told him that her\r\nmistress was angry with her, but she had \"fitted her now\" for she\r\nhad put a great toad into her kettle of milk. As it turned out\r\nthe Court ordered Mehitable to be severely whipped and to pay £40\r\ndamages to her master Jacob Perkins. It now seems incredible that a\r\nserving maid of 1668 could ever get together so large a sum of money.\r\n\r\nThe settlers in the New England Colonies, unless persons of wealth\r\nor possessed of large families, during the early years lived\r\ngenerally in houses having but one room and an entry-way on the\r\nground floor. Above would be a chamber--sometimes only a garret.\r\nAs the family increased in size and became more prosperous another\r\nroom would be added to the house on the other side of the entry and\r\nchimney, making the structure a so-called two-room house. Still\r\nlater, with the need for more room, a leanto would be built on the\r\nback of the house, thereby supplying three additional rooms on the\r\nground floor with a kitchen in the middle. The earlier kitchen\r\nwould then become a living-room or \"sitting room\"--in the New\r\nEngland phrase. This earlier kitchen was usually called \"the hall\"\r\nduring the seventeenth century and in it centered the life of the\r\nfamily. It was the room where the food was cooked and eaten. There\r\nthe family sat and there the indoor work was carried on. A loom\r\nsometimes occupied considerable space near a window and frequently\r\na bed was made up in a corner, on which the father of the family\r\nslept, and there sometimes also he died.\r\n\r\nThe principal feature of this common room was its huge fireplace\r\nin which hung pots and kettles suspended by means of pot chains\r\nand trammels from the hardwood trammel-bar or lug-pole that rested\r\non wooden cross bars and so bisected the wide flue in the chimney.\r\nThese large fireplaces in the early days were sometimes called\r\n\"chimneys\" in the vernacular of the time. They were generally as\r\nwide as eight feet and a ten foot opening is not unknown.\r\n\r\nThis cavernous opening was spanned by a wooden lintel--a stick of\r\ntimber sometimes sixteen inches or more square, and when exposed\r\nto a roaring fire, piled high with logs, this became an element of\r\ndanger, the charring wood smoldering all night and setting fire\r\nto the house. The trammel-bar in the flue also caught fire not\r\ninfrequently and gave way, allowing the pots and kettles to fall to\r\nthe hearth, bringing disaster to the dinner or to the curdling milk\r\nand sometimes to those seated near. A trammel stick in the house of\r\nCaptain Denney gave way from this cause and a large kettle filled\r\nwith wort[25] fell down and spilt the boiling liquid over four of\r\nhis children who were sitting or lying on the hearth, some of them\r\nasleep, \"which scalded them in so terrible a manner, that one died\r\npresently after, and another's life is dispaired of\" continues the\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n  [25] Beer in the making.\r\n\r\n\"Here is good living for those who love good fires,\" wrote Higginson\r\nin his _New-Englands Plantation_, and under the spell of the\r\nglowing flames, the bare, whitewashed walls, the brown timbers and\r\nfloor boards of the ceiling, the dress of pewter, and the simple\r\nfurnishings of the room, enriched by the shadows, became a place\r\nfull of cheer--a place where privation and homesickness might be\r\nforgotten in the glow of the bright firelight. On cold nights the\r\nshort bench inside the fireplace was a chosen place and the settle,\r\na long seat made of boards with a high back to keep off the draft,\r\nwas drawn before the fire and here sat the older members of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe larger kettles hanging in the fireplace, were of brass and\r\ncopper and some of them were of prodigious size. Hot water was\r\nalways to be had and these kettles also served for the daily\r\ncooking, the cheese-making, soap-boiling, and candle-dipping.\r\n\r\nMuch of the food of the average New Englander until comparatively\r\nrecent times consisted of corn-meal, boiled meats and vegetables and\r\nstews. Every well-equipped household had its spits for roasting and\r\nmany had gridirons, but the usual diet of the average family was\r\n\"hasty pudding\"--cornmeal mush and milk--varied by boiled meat or\r\nfish served in the center of a large pewter platter and surrounded\r\nby boiled vegetables. Baked beans and stewed beans appeared on the\r\ntable several times every week in the year. Indian bannock, made\r\nby mixing corn meal with water and spreading it an inch thick on a\r\nsmall board placed at an incline before the fire and so baked, was a\r\ncommon form of bread. When mixed with rye meal it became brown bread\r\nand was baked in the brick oven with the beans and peas.\r\n\r\nThe brick oven was a feature of every chimney. Sometimes in early\r\ndays it was built partly outside the house but so far as known\r\nthe opening was always in the kitchen fireplace. To reach it the\r\nhousewife must stoop below the oaken lintel and stand inside the\r\nfireplace, taking care that her woolen skirts did not come near the\r\nflames. To heat it for a baking, a fire was built inside, usually\r\nwith specially prepared pine or birch wood that had been split and\r\nseasoned out of doors for a short time and then housed. The fire\r\nand ashes were then taken out by means of a peel--a long-handled,\r\nflat-bladed shovel made for the purpose--and when dusted out with a\r\nbroom made of hemlock twigs it was ready for the brown bread, beans,\r\npeas, Indian pudding, pies, and rye drop cakes which were made with\r\nrye meal, eggs and milk and baked directly on the bricks in the\r\nbottom of the oven.\r\n\r\nBetween the years of 1635 and 1655, court records and inventories\r\nof estates in the Massachusetts Bay Colony mention the following\r\narticles of food:\r\n\r\nBacon, beef, butter, cheese, eggs, fowls, lamb, milk, mutton, pork,\r\nsuet, veal, wild game, and cod, herring, mackerel, salmon and\r\nsturgeon.\r\n\r\nBarley, beans, Indian beans, bran, cabbages, carrots, chaff, corn,\r\nEnglish corn, Indian corn, hops, Indian meal, rye meal, oatmeal,\r\noats, parsnips, peas, pumpions, rye, squashes, turnips and wheat.\r\n\r\nApples, berries, fruit, honey, raisins, sugar and vinegar.\r\n\r\nBiscuit, blewlman, bread, cake, malt, salad oil, porridge, rye malt,\r\nyeast, salt and many kinds of spices.\r\n\r\nMuch of this food was raised on the farm and nearly every family\r\nhad its garden. Such articles of food as were imported were usually\r\nobtained at the shops in the larger towns by barter, as money was\r\nscarce. In 1651, a farmer came through the woods to Salem in his\r\ncart bringing twelve bushels of rye. He stopped at a shop owned\r\nby George Corwin and from the daybook kept at the time and still\r\ncarefully preserved, we learn that among other necessaries he\r\ncarried home sugar for the goodwife, and for the children a doll and\r\na bird whistle.\r\n\r\nIn the early years domestic animals were too valuable to be killed\r\nfor meat but game was plentiful and was roasted by being trussed on\r\niron spits resting on curved brackets on the backs of the andirons.\r\nThis, of course, required constant turning to expose the roast on\r\nall sides in order to cook it evenly--a task frequently delegated to\r\na child. A skillet would be placed beneath to catch the drippings.\r\nSometimes a bird was suspended before the fire by a twisted cord\r\nthat would slowly unwind and partly wind again, requiring some\r\none in frequent attendance to twist the cord. Families of wealth\r\npossessed a \"jack\" to turn the spit. This was a mechanism fastened\r\nover the fireplace and connected with the spit by means of a pulley\r\nand cord. A heavy weight suspended by a cord which slowly unwound,\r\nsupplied the power that turned the spit.\r\n\r\nIn \"the hall,\" usually upon open shelves, but sometimes upon a\r\ndresser, was displayed the pride of the housewife--the dress of\r\npewter and latten ware. \"China dishes,\" imported by the East India\r\nCompany or made in Holland, were used sparingly during the early\r\nyears of the colonies. There was much earthenware and stoneware\r\nbottles and jugs, but it was wooden ware and pewter that were\r\ncommonly used. When Lionel Chute died in 1645 he bequeathed his\r\nsilver spoon to his son James.[26] It was the only piece of silver\r\nin the house. Of pewter he died possessed of fourteen dishes \"small\r\nand great,\" eleven pewter salts, saucers and porringers, two pewter\r\ncandlesticks and a pewter bottle. The widow Rebecca Bacon who died\r\nin Salem in 1655, left an estate of £195. 8. 6., which included a\r\nwell-furnished house. She had brass pots, skillets, candlesticks,\r\nskimmers, a little brass pan, and an excellent supply of pewter\r\nincluding \"3 large pewter platters, 3 a size lesse, 3 more a size\r\nlesse, 3 more a size lesse,\" having a total value of £1.16. She\r\nalso had a pewter basin, six large pewter plates, and six lesser,\r\nnineteen pewter saucers, two fruit dishes, an old basin and a\r\ngreat plate, two candlesticks, one large salt and a small one, two\r\nporringers, a great flagon, one lesser, one quart, two pints and a\r\nhalf pint; and an old porringer. She also left \"1 silver duble salt,\r\n6 silver spoones, wine cup & a dram cup of silver.\"\r\n\r\n  [26] _Probate Records of Essex County, Mass._, Vol. I, p. 47.\r\n\r\nGiles Badger of Newbury left to his young widow, a glass bowl,\r\nbeaker, and jug valued at three shillings; three silver spoons\r\nvalued at £1, and a good assortment of pewter, including \"a salt\r\nseller, a tunell and a great dowruff.\" The household was also\r\nfurnished with six wooden dishes and two wooden platters. In other\r\ninventories appear unusual items such as a pewter brim basin,\r\npewter cullenders, pewter beer cups, pans, and mustard pots. Pewter\r\ntankards were common. There were new and old fashioned candlesticks.\r\nPewter salts came in three sizes and the saucers were both small\r\nand large. In 1693, best London pewter plates cost the Boston\r\nshopkeepers 9-1/2 pence per pound in quantity.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century \"hall\" must have had little spare room for\r\nits daily occupants, for in addition to its table and chairs, its\r\nsettle, stools and washbench, the long ago inventories disclose\r\nsuch chattels as powdering tubs in which the salted meats were\r\nkept, the churn, barrels containing a great variety of things,\r\nkeelers and buckets, bucking tubs for washing, and the various\r\nimplements used in spinning and weaving, washing and ironing,\r\ncooking and brewing, and the making of butter and cheese. In the\r\nchimney hung hams and bacon and suspended from the ceiling were\r\nstrings of dried apples and hands of seed corn.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by some that the floors were sanded. That certainly\r\nwas true at a later period but there are strong elements of doubt\r\nas to the prevalence of this custom during the seventeenth century.\r\nSand, however, was used freely with home-made soft soap, to scrub\r\nthe floors which were always kept white and clean, and whenever\r\nan early house is restored or taken down sand is always found,\r\nsometimes in considerable quantity, where it has sifted down through\r\nthe cracks between the floor boards. The downstairs rooms had\r\ndouble floors but the chamber floors were made of one thickness of\r\nboards with here and there a knothole and frequently with cracks\r\nbetween the boards through which the dust and dirt from above\r\nmust have sifted down upon the heads of those seated at dinner or\r\nengaged in their daily tasks in the rooms below. Not only does the\r\nstructural evidence show this to be true but a number of instances\r\noccur among the papers in Court files, where witnesses have deposed\r\nas to what they had seen and heard through the cracks in chamber\r\nfloors. A grandson of Governor Endecott once fell a victim of two\r\ngossiping sixteen-year-old girls who had spent some time on their\r\nknees peeping through the cracks in a chamber floor. Capt. Richard\r\nMore, the last survivor of the company on the _Mayflower_, late in\r\nlife kept a tavern in Salem. He was spied upon in this manner and\r\neventually brought before the justices of the Quarterly Court to\r\nanswer for his evasion of the law set forth and maintained at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe parlor, called \"the foreroom\" at a later time, was the room\r\nwhere guests of station were received. The best bed hung with\r\ncurtains and valance and covered with a rug, stood in a corner. In\r\nthose days rugs were not used on floors but as bed furnishings.\r\nEven the baby's cradle had its rug. Carpets, likewise, were too fine\r\nfor wooden floors and were used as table covers. Of bedsteads there\r\nwere many kinds--high and low, canopy, close, corded, half-headed,\r\njoined, side, standing, inlaid, and wainscot, and slipped under\r\nthe higher bedsteads during the daytime, were trundle or \"truckle\"\r\nbeds in which the children slept at night. Lionel Chute, the\r\nschoolmaster, had an \"old darnkell coverlet\" on his bed while some\r\nof his neighbors possessed branched and embroidered coverlets and\r\nseveral had coverlets made of tapestry.\r\n\r\nAmong the better families the parlor and chamber windows had\r\ncurtains hung from rods or cords. In the parlor stood chests in\r\nwhich were stored the family clothing and bedding, for closets did\r\nnot exist in the seventeenth century house. There were great chests\r\nand small chests, long boarded and great boarded chests, chests\r\nwith a drawer, carved chests, wainscot chests, trunks, and boxes. A\r\nfew stools and chairs, a looking-glass, a small table, and perhaps\r\na cupboard completed the furnishings of the well-supplied parlor.\r\nIn Capt. George Corwin's best room there were chairs with leather\r\nbottoms and straw bottoms, a clock valued at £2, a screen having\r\nfive leaves, a napkin press, and a \"Scriture or Spice box.\" White\r\ncalico curtains hung at his chamber windows and the maid had a\r\n\"Calico Cuberd cloth\" in her room. Parlor walls were whitewashed and\r\nbare of ornament. The first families owned a portrait or two in oils\r\nand here and there a map in unglazed frame decorated a wall. The\r\nPuritan character did not warm to the fine arts and austere living\r\nwas the aim if not always the achievement of the time.\r\n\r\nThe chambers in the second story must have been curiously furnished\r\nrooms, containing a huddle of stores of all descriptions. Henry\r\nShort, the town clerk of Newbury, died in 1673 leaving a goodly\r\nestate valued at nearly £2,000.[27] He owned a negro slave and his\r\nhouse was large and well furnished. There was an old parlor and a\r\nnew parlor containing beds, chests, chairs, trunks, and boxes. In\r\nthe chamber over the new parlor there was a good feather-bed and\r\nbed clothing but no bedstead. Wool and yarn were stored in this\r\nroom together with boxes, tubs, some feathers, and miscellaneous\r\n\"lumber\"--the phrase of the period for odds and ends. The chamber\r\nover the kitchen, a comfortable room of course, in winter, had its\r\nbed and bedding, also \"5 hogsheds, 6 barrels, 5 Iron hoopes, a\r\npair of stockcards, meale trough & other lumber, a parcell of old\r\nIron, a pike, a bed cord & other cordage.\" Small wonder in such a\r\nclutter that the rooms frequently had other tenantry than the human\r\noccupants.\r\n\r\n  [27] _Probate Records of Essex County, Mass._, Vol. II, p. 348.\r\n\r\nWhen Jasper Dankers arrived in Boston in 1680, the captain of the\r\npacket took him to his sister's house where he lodged. \"We were\r\ntaken to a fine large chamber,\" he writes, \"but we were hardly in\r\nbed before we were shockingly bitten. I did not know the cause,\r\nbut was not able to sleep.... My comrade who was very sleepy, fell\r\nasleep at first. He tumbled about very much; but I did not sleep\r\nany the whole night. In the morning we saw how it was, and were\r\nastonished we should find such a room with such a lady.\"[28]\r\n\r\n  [28] Dankers, _Journal of a Voyage to New York_, Brooklyn, 1867.\r\n\r\nEarly in the eighteenth century the walls of rooms in some\r\nMassachusetts houses began to be covered with \"painted paper\"\r\nhangings imported from England. These _papier paints_ were first\r\nintroduced into England, from France, about 1634, and probably were\r\nbrought into New England by Governor Andros and his followers.\r\nMichael Perry, a Boston bookseller, who died in 1700, had in his\r\nstock \"7 quires of painted paper and three reams of painted paper.\"\r\nHis successor, Daniel Henchman, dealt in painted papers as appears\r\nfrom his account books commencing in 1712. In 1713 two quires of\r\npainted paper cost four shillings, and two quires of blue paper,\r\nthree shillings. In 1714, Isaac Thomas of Pembroke paid £2. 10. 0\r\nfor \"6 Rowls Paint'd Pap'r & 2 Q'r Paper.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Peter Sergeant of Boston died in 1714, the inventory of his\r\nestate disclosed \"one large gilt looking glass, in the cedar room,\r\n£5. One suit of Imagery Tapestry hanging, £20. One suit of red china\r\n£5.\" Two years later the house was purchased by the Provincial\r\nGovernment for a governor's residence and in 1741 we find the\r\nProvincial Treasurer paying Daniel Henchman £5. 8. 0. for four\r\nrolls of painted paper and shortly another bill was presented for\r\n\"New Tacking the paper hanging above in the chamber & new papering\r\none roome below stairs.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1734, John Maverick, shopkeeper, bought of Henchman, four quires\r\nand five sheets of painted paper for £1. 3. 9. In 1736, Colonel\r\nEstes Hatch bought 10 rolls painted paper for £16. 5. 0. which\r\nwas probably used in his mansion in Dorchester, bought after the\r\nRevolution by Colonel James Swan.\r\n\r\nThe painted paper of the eighteenth century was sold at first in\r\nsheets, 22 by 32 inches, called elephant size. Later these were\r\npasted together to make 12 yard lengths. In the earlier stages of\r\nmanufacture the designs were colored by hand. Stencils of pasteboard\r\nwere used, and in the last half of the eighteenth century blocks\r\nof pear and sycamore wood were used, as in calico printing. One\r\nwho painted coats of arms and other things pertaining to heraldry,\r\nas well as one who painted or stained linen cloth, was known as a\r\n\"painter stainer.\" So, also, those who stained colored or stamped\r\npaper for hangings were known as \"paper stainers.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas Hancock built his house on Beacon Hill he desired\r\npainted paper for some of his rooms. Extracts from his letter to\r\nJohn Rowe, stationer, London, explain his wants:\r\n\r\n\"Sir: Inclosed you have the Dimensions of a Room for a shaded\r\nHanging to be Done after the same Pattern I have sent per Capt.\r\nTanner. The pattern is all that was left of a Room lately come\r\nover here, and it takes much in ye Town and will be the only\r\npaper-hanging for sale here which am of opinion may Answer well....\r\nIf they can make it more beautiful by adding more Birds flying here\r\nand there, with some Landskips at the Bottom, Should like it well.\r\nLet the Ground be the same colour of the Pattern. At the top and\r\nbottom was a narrow Border of about 2 inches wide which would have\r\nto mine....\r\n\r\n\"A hanging done much handsomer sent over three or four years\r\nprevious was made by Dunbar in Aldermanbury....\r\n\r\n\"In other of these Hangings are great variety of different Sorts\r\nof Birds, Peacocks, Macoys, Squirrill, Monkys, Fruit and Flowers,\r\netc.... I think they are handsomer and better than Painted hangings\r\ndone in Oyle so I beg your particular Care in procuring this for\r\nme and that the patterns may be taken care off and Return'd with\r\nmy Goods.\"--_Letter of Thomas Hancock to John Rowe, Stationer, in\r\nLondon_, Jan. 23, 1737/8.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth-century Boston newspapers may be found numerous\r\nitems showing the use of wall paper and the fact that it frequently\r\nwas imported from England. But while it is true that it could be\r\npurchased in the shops in Boston it does not follow that rooms in\r\nevery house were papered. Nor is it likely that the rooms of houses\r\nin the country had papered walls save when the owner was a wealthy\r\nman. London fashions would first be found transplanted into the\r\nseaport towns and later would be adopted by the country. Undoubtedly\r\nthe home of the Governor, or of some well-to-do sea captain, was\r\nthe first house to be so decorated. On September 22, 1762, died\r\nDaniel Starr of Boston, \"who has been for many years employed in\r\nPapering Rooms.\" This item appears in the news items of the _Boston\r\nNews-Letter_. Eight years later the same newspaper prints the\r\nfollowing advertisement:\r\n\r\n\"George Killcup, jun. Informs the Gentlemen and Ladies in Town and\r\nCountry That he Paints Carpets & other Articles, and Paper Rooms in\r\nthe neatest manner. He will take English or West India Goods as Pay.\r\n\r\n\"Said Killcup is ready to pay those he is indebted to, in Painting\r\nor Papering Rooms.\"--_Boston News-Letter_, March 17, 1768.\r\n\r\n\"Roll Paper for Rooms,\" with \"most sorts of Stationary Ware\" were\r\nadvertised for sale by John Parker, over against the shop of Mr.\r\nDolbeare, Brazier, at the Head of the Town Dock, Boston.--_Boston\r\nNews-Letter_, June 3-10, 1736.\r\n\r\nJ.

Between 1635 and 1681 there were 960 estates probated\r\nin Essex County, Massachusetts. The county had several seaport towns\r\nand its inhabitants were more prosperous than many other parts of\r\nthe Colony. In the inventories of these 960 estates, pictures are\r\nlisted but eight times and maps were found in but three homes.\r\nWilliam Hollingsworth, the shipbuilder and merchant of Salem,\r\npossessed seven framed pictures. They are the only _framed_ pictures\r\nmentioned. Hilliard Veren of Salem, who died in 1668, had three\r\npictures in his hall chamber and Robert Gray of the same town had\r\nin his parlor a large looking-glass with some earthen dishes and\r\na picture, the whole valued at £2. The Rev. Nathaniel Rogers of\r\nIpswich, had two pictures in his parlor and Thomas Wells of Ipswich,\r\nbequeathed to his son Thomas, the new pictures of the King and Queen\r\nand the one of the \"five sencces.\" He also possessed maps and paper\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nFifty years later John Smibert, the portrait painter, had his shop\r\n\"at his House in Queen Street, between the Town House and the Orange\r\nTree, Boston,\" where he sold \"all sorts of Colours, dry or ground\r\nwith Oyls and Brushes, Fans of several sorts, the best Mezotints,\r\nItalian, French, Dutch and English Prints, in Frames and Glasses or\r\nwithout, by Wholesale or Retail, at Reasonable Rates.\" About the\r\nsame time the \"Royal Waxwork\" was to be seen at the House of Mr.\r\nThomas Brooks, shopkeeper, near the Draw Bridge, and Thomas White,\r\nthe engraver, was living in a house not far away.\r\n\r\nHere are a few advertisements from early newspapers bearing on\r\nfurnishing the house:\r\n\r\nBED HANGINGS.

A _comforter_\r\nsuggests warmth and comfort not only for the bed but for the neck.\r\nThe _bed cover_ is universal as is the _quilt_.\r\n\r\nThe patchwork quilt was formerly one of the most familiar and\r\nnecessary articles of household furnishing and its origin\r\nreaches backward into the dim and unknown past. It was brought\r\nto the Massachusetts Bay by the first settlers. In cottage and\r\ncastle it was known in the days of King John, and down through\r\nthe generations its making supplied occupation and amusement to\r\ncountless women whose life interests centered in their homes and\r\nhousehold furnishings. Its manufacture may well be styled one of the\r\nhousehold arts, for artistic indeed are the bold conceptions of many\r\nof the designs; while the piecing and the patching provide ample\r\nopportunity for needlework of the finest character.\r\n\r\nIn the early days the English spelled quilt with a final\r\n_e_--quilte--as did the French. It is a cover or coverlet made\r\nby stitching together two thicknesses of a fabric with some soft\r\nsubstance between them. This applies to bed covers and also to\r\nquilted petticoats so commonly worn in the old days.\r\n\r\nWhat is a coverlet? Originally, any covering for a bed; now,\r\nspecifically, the outer covering. The word comes from the French\r\n_couvre-lit_--a bed covering. The handwoven coverlets of many\r\nbeautiful designs, in blue and white and red and brown, are well\r\nknown and formerly were woven everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe _counter-pane_, formerly a bed cover, now describes a light\r\ncoverlet woven of cotton with raised figures. The word is a\r\ncorruption of _counterpoint_, in allusion to the panes or squares\r\nof which bed covers are often composed. The counterpane was never\r\nquilted.\r\n\r\nThe _bedspread_ and the _bed cover_ may be considered as one and\r\nthe same--the uppermost covering of a bed and accordingly of an\r\nornamental character in general. The _comforter_ was a thickly\r\nquilted bed cover made of several thicknesses of sheet cotton or\r\nwool prepared for the purpose. This was too thick to be quilted so\r\nit was knotted at regular intervals to prevent the interlining from\r\nslipping out of place. Frequently it was called a \"comfort.\"\r\n\r\nThere is one other name that was applied to a bed covering in the\r\nColonial times but which is never heard today in that connection. In\r\nthe days immediately following the settlement many a New England bed\r\nwas covered with a _rug_. When William Clarke of Salem died in 1647,\r\nin the parlor of his house was a bed with a green rug covering it\r\nwhich was valued by the appraisers at fourteen shillings. The term\r\nwas commonly in use at the time, in fact, as commonly as the word\r\ncoverlet. In the probate of Essex County, Massachusetts, estates\r\nbetween the years 1635 and 1674, coverlets are mentioned one hundred\r\nand forty-two times and rugs one hundred and fifty-seven times while\r\nquilts are listed only four times. These early bed rugs were usually\r\nthick woolen coverings with a shaggy nap.\r\n\r\nA never-failing source of accurate information as to the furnishings\r\nand equipment of the New England household in the olden time is the\r\nprobate records--specifically, the inventory of the property taken\r\nin connection with the settlement of the estate. For many years\r\nit was the well-nigh universal custom to list, room by room, the\r\ncontents of a house and from these painstaking inventories it now\r\nbecomes possible to reconstruct in mental picture the interiors\r\nof those homes where lived and died our Puritan ancestors. In\r\nconnection with the present subject we learn from these inventories\r\nthat it was quite the usual habit to set up a bed in the parlor and\r\nwe also learn of the existence of different kinds of rugs used in\r\nthe bed furnishings--cotton rugs, English rugs, Irish rugs, cradle\r\nrugs, etc. There were worsted coverlets, tapestry coverlets and\r\nembroidered coverlets. A darnacle coverlet is listed in 1665; but as\r\ndarnacle curtains appear in the same inventory it is safe to assume\r\nthat darnacle is the name of some long-forgotten fabric. But what is\r\na \"branched coverlet?\" Mrs. Thomas Newhall of Lynn possessed in 1674\r\na green rug and a branched coverlet.\r\n\r\nCapt. George Corwin of Salem who died in 1684, had a calico\r\ncounterpane in the red chamber in his house. In the corner chamber\r\nwas a green counterpane and in the kitchen chamber was a sad colored\r\ncounterpane, two coverlets, and a quilt of colored and flowered\r\ncalico.\r\n\r\nLet us have a look at a few of these wills and inventories. In 1640,\r\nthe widow Bethia Cartwright of Salem, bequeathed to her sister, then\r\nliving in England, her bed, bolster, blanket and coverlet. It is an\r\nopen question if the value of the property equalled the probable\r\ncost of transporting it to that loving sister in distant England.\r\n\r\nMrs. Joanna Cummings of Salem, at her death in 1644, among many\r\nother items possessed a feather bed, flock bolster and a green rug,\r\njointly valued at £2. 5. 0.\r\n\r\nIn the \"hall\" of John Goffe's house, in Newbury, in 1641, were found\r\n\"3 bedsteeds, £1; 1 pr. curtains with 3 rods, 18s.; 1 green rugg,\r\n£1. 6.; 2 blankets, 15 s.; 1 bed, bolster and 4 pillows, £4. 10.; 1\r\ncoverlet, 10s.; and 1 bed matt, 2s.\"\r\n\r\nThe next year William Howard, afterwards the first town clerk of\r\nTopsfield, was one of the appraisers of the estate of Samuel Smith\r\nof Enon, the name by which Wenham was then known. In one of the\r\nchambers he found a \"bed, blancits & coverlet\" which he valued at\r\n£7. 8. Rather a valuable bed, or, may it have been the coverlet?\r\nIn connection with \"cobbard clothes\" at £1. he lists a \"carpitt\"\r\nat 15s; and this carpet, curiously enough, he did not find on the\r\nfloor but on a table. Joanna Cummings owned a \"carpet & table\" that\r\nwere valued at 7s. 8d. Joseph Metcalf of Ipswich had \"a table &\r\nold carpett\" worth £1. In the parlor of Governor Endecott's house\r\nin Boston were found a \"Table, Carpet & 3 stools,\" valued at 50s.\r\nWilliam Bacon's \"carpets & qushens\" were worth £1. 10s. and in the\r\ninventory of the estate of Rev. Ezekiel Rogers of Rowley, appears\r\nthe following: \"a presse and a litle Table with ther Carpets, £1.\r\n10s.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Whittingham lived in Ipswich and died in 1648. In the parlor\r\nof his house was found a \"Joyne Table with Five chairs & one ould\r\nCarpet, 10s.; one cupboard and Cloth, 10s.; 2 paire Cobirons, 15s.;\r\ntwo window Curtains and curtaine rods, 6s.; one case of Bottles,\r\n5s.; Books, £6. 5s.; Eleven Cushions, £1. 10s.; one Still, 5s.;\"\r\nand perhaps most important of all--\"one fetherbed, one flockbed,\r\ntwo boulsters, one pillow, one p. blankets, one Rugge, Curtains\r\n& valients and bedsted, £12.\" In the chamber over the parlor was\r\nanother bedstead well supplied with furnishings, including two\r\nquilts, a blue coverlet and a trundle bed. This upstairs chamber had\r\nwall hangings which were valued at £2. 10s. and in the room were six\r\ntrunks, a chest and a box, containing stores of bed linen, table\r\ncloths, napkins, hose yarn, silver plate and eleven spoons. Two\r\nchairs, four stools, a screen, two pairs of cobirons and a pair of\r\ntongs completed the furnishings of the room. It almost stands open\r\nbefore us. And those wall hangings valued at £2. 10s.!\r\n\r\nAnother parlor chamber in a house in Newbury, in which had lived the\r\nminister, the Rev. James Noyes, was more meagerly furnished. Here\r\nthe appraisers found \"2 boxes, 4 hogsheads, a musket and a gun and\r\ntwo swords, £2.; a bolster and a quilt & two blankets and a parsell\r\nof Cotton wooll, £3. 10s.\"\r\n\r\nJust one more inventory--the estate of William Clarke who died in\r\n1647 in Salem. The parlor contained a half-headed bedstead with\r\ncurtains and vallance which was furnished with a feather bed and\r\nbolster, a straw bed and flock bolster, white blankets, sheets,\r\nand a green rug. In a corner of this parlor stood another bedstead\r\nhaving a mat, canvas flock bed, sheets, old blankets and a red rug,\r\nand in the chamber over the kitchen was a low bedstead with a flock\r\nbed and bolster, a blanket, a rug and an old quilt.\r\n\r\nHere are two kinds of bedsteads mentioned in this house, but there\r\nwere other kinds in frequent use at the time: high beds and side\r\nbeds, canopy bedsteads, half-headed, joined, cabin, corded, close,\r\npress, standing, truckle and trundle bedsteads and what is strange\r\nindeed, not a single example of these early bedsteads has been\r\npreserved. All have been worn out or destroyed--supplanted by a\r\nnewer fashion--and we today can only imagine their various forms and\r\ndecorations.\r\n\r\nIn the New England vernacular, materials for quilts were \"skurse\"\r\nin the olden times. The settlers, of course, brought all their\r\nfurnishings from England and a few years elapsed before wool and\r\nflax were produced here in any quantity. Meanwhile all fabrics were\r\nimported and paid for by shipments of salt fish, furs, lumber, corn,\r\netc. A brisk trade soon sprang up with the West Indies and Spain and\r\ncotton was brought into the New England ports. Some of the fabrics\r\nin common use before 1650 have names that sound strangely in our\r\nears. Darnacle has been mentioned. There were baize for jackets,\r\ncalico for dresses, linsey woolsey for heavy skirts, serge for\r\nvarious articles of clothing, coifing stuff for caps, linen for\r\nforehead bands and many other uses, dimity for bed hangings and\r\npetticoats, and a fabric known as \"barber's stuff.\" In time some of\r\nthese materials became available for quilt making and at a still\r\nlater time the handwoven, home-dyed fabrics were used and some of\r\nthese were rudely decorated with tied and dipped patterns or stamped\r\nand stencilled designs.\r\n\r\nIt should always be kept in mind, however, that geographical\r\nlocation largely enters into the production and character of the\r\nquilt, and the family that was \"well-off\" of course would be\r\nsupplied more abundantly with furnishings and be less dependent upon\r\nhomely makeshifts and the daily practice of household economy. Those\r\nliving in the seaport towns, where most of the shops were found,\r\nwould be likely to follow the simplest course of fashion and buy\r\nfrom the stock just imported from England or Holland. The hand loom\r\nwas found everywhere but more generally in the country. Weaving\r\nwas a trade for men and so practiced, but many a farmhouse had its\r\nloom and every country home its spinning wheel. In the larger towns\r\nthe dame of social position or comfortable means would devote her\r\nspare moments to needlework and embroidery, while in the country the\r\nhousewives would make pieced quilts or patch the clothing of their\r\nnumerous children.\r\n\r\nIt naturally follows, that the handwoven coverlet, should be a\r\nproduct of the country rather than the town and usually of the\r\ncountryside farthest removed from the influences of the shop and\r\nof English goods. Even today it is still woven in the remote\r\nsettlements of Eastern Kentucky and Tennessee, and judging from\r\nexisting examples the vogue of the handwoven coverlet was greater\r\nin New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and the Middle West than in\r\nNew England although many fine examples were produced here. The\r\nmanufacture of the patchwork quilt as a domestic art also seems to\r\nhave reached its highest development in the Middle West during the\r\nfirst half of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe patchwork quilt of New England is known as the \"pieced quilt\"\r\nwhen made in the Middle West and more correctly so, for _to\r\npiece_ means to join together separate pieces of like material\r\ninto sections or blocks that in turn are united to form the top\r\nof the quilt. The pieces usually are of uniform shape and size\r\nand contrasting colors are blended to form the design--usually a\r\ngeometric pattern. These pieces are sewed \"over and over\" on the\r\nwrong side. To _patch_ means to mend or adorn by adding a patch or\r\nby laying over a separate piece of cloth. The French word _applique_\r\nwell describes the patched or laid-on work where the design is cut\r\nout and applied or sewed on, in fact, \"sewed-on quilts\" and \"laid\r\nquilts\" are old terms. This type of quilt is found in New England\r\nbut infrequently as compared with the \"pieced quilt,\" here commonly\r\nknown as the \"patchwork quilt.\"\r\n\r\nIn early times the pieces were nearly always of a woolen fabric,\r\nthe brighter colored cloth being saved for the more central\r\nportions of the design. Every scrap and remnant of material left\r\nfrom the making of garments was saved and the best pieces of\r\nworn-out garments were carefully cut out and made into quilt pieces.\r\nThe historian of the Saco Valley, Maine, relates that a scarlet\r\nbroadcloth cloak formerly worn by a Lord Mayor of London and brought\r\nto Massachusetts by a member of the Merritt family of Salisbury,\r\nMass., after many adventures ended its days as small bits of vivid\r\ncolor in a patchwork quilt made in Maine. Portions of discarded\r\nmilitary uniforms, of flannel shirts and well-worn petticoats were\r\nutilized and frequently an old blanket would be used for lining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCONCERNING THEIR APPAREL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1630 there were differences in dress even more so than at the\r\npresent time. The simple, coarse clothing of the yeoman and the\r\nworker in the various trades was far removed from the dress of the\r\nmerchant and the magistrate. Leather clothing was very generally\r\nworn by laborers and servants as deerskins were cheap and leather\r\nhad been in common use for jerkins and breeches in Old England, so\r\nnaturally it was worn here. Stockings were made of a variety of\r\nmaterials and most shoes had wooden heels.\r\n\r\nHigher in the social scale men wore doublets and full breeches and\r\nclothed themselves as well as their estates permitted--sometimes\r\neven better than they could well afford. Sleeves were slashed.\r\nFalling bands at the neck were common and a deep linen collar\r\nappears in portraits of the period. A beaver or felt hat with\r\nsteeple crown was worn, and gloves, sometimes elegantly embroidered,\r\nwere essential. The accepted idea of Puritan dress should be revised\r\nand the Victorian standard of sentimental simplicity be discarded.\r\nThere was great variety of fabrics available in the shops of London\r\nand Bristol as will be noted in the list at the end of this chapter,\r\nand as wealth permitted probably much of this material eventually\r\nfound its way to the shelves of the shopkeepers in Boston and other\r\nof the larger seaport towns.\r\n\r\nThe following list of clothing each man should provide himself with\r\non sailing for New England in 1629, when the Rev. Francis Higginson\r\ncame over, is so specific that we can easily visualize the male\r\ncompany that arrived at Salem that year.\r\n\r\n     NOTE. As several excellent books are available that treat\r\n     exclusively of costume in the colonies, it has not seemed\r\n     necessary to elaborate on the subject in these pages. The\r\n     following notes however, are thought to be of interest.\r\n\r\n  4 peares of shoes.\r\n  4 peares of stockings.\r\n  1 peare Norwich gaiters.\r\n  4 shirts\r\n\r\n  2 suits dublet and hose of leather\r\n  lyn'd with oy'd skin leather, ye\r\n  hose & dublett with hooks &\r\n  eyes.\r\n\r\n  1 suit of Nordon dussens or hampshire\r\n  kersies lyn'd the hose with\r\n  skins, dublets with lynen of gilford\r\n  or gedlyman kerseys.\r\n\r\n  4 bands\r\n\r\n  2 handkerchiefs\r\n\r\n  1 wastecoat of greene cotton bound\r\n  about with red tape\r\n\r\n  1 leather girdle\r\n\r\n  1 Monmouth cap\r\n\r\n  1 black hatt lyned in the brows with\r\n  lether\r\n\r\n  5 Red Knitt capps mill'd about 5d.\r\n  apiece\r\n\r\n  2 peares of gloves\r\n\r\n  1 Mandillion [mantle or great\r\n  coat] lyned with cotton\r\n\r\n  1 peare of breeches and waistcoat\r\n\r\n  1 leather sute of Dublett & breeches\r\n  of oyled leather\r\n\r\n  1 peare of leather breeches and\r\n  drawers to weare with both\r\n  there other sutes.\r\n\r\nFine clothing surrounded itself with fine furnishings, according\r\nto the standards of the period, and as the wealth of the Colony\r\nincreased with the successful exportation of fish, lumber, beaver,\r\nand peltry, it supplied them with all kinds of luxuries and\r\nrefinements. The ships were crossing frequently and the Colony kept\r\npace with the mother country much as the country follows the city at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Ipswich, lived Madam Rebecka Symonds, writing in\r\nher sixtieth year to her son in London to send her a fashionable\r\n\"lawn whiske,\" for her neckwear. In due time he replied that the\r\n\"fashionable Lawn whiske is not now worn, either by Gentil or\r\nsimple, young or old. Instead where of I have bought a shape and\r\nruffles, which is now the ware of the gravest as well as the young\r\nones. Such as goe not with naked necks ware a black wifle over it.\r\nTherefore, I have not only Bought a plaine one y't you sent for, but\r\nalso a Luster one, such as are most in fashion.\"\r\n\r\nThe dutiful son also purchased for his mother's wear a feather fan;\r\nbut he writes to her \"I should also have found in my heart, to have\r\nlet it alone, because none but very grave persons (and of them very\r\nfew) use it. Now 'tis grown almost as obsolete as Russets, and more\r\nrare to be seen than a yellow Hood.\" When the feather fan reached\r\nIpswich it was found to have a silver handle and with it came \"two\r\ntortois fans, 200 needles, 5 yds. sky calico, silver gimp, a black\r\nsarindin cloak, damson leather skin, two women's Ivorie Knives,\r\netc.\"[30]\r\n\r\n  [30] Waters, _Ipswich in the Massachusetts Bay Colony_, Ipswich,\r\n  1905.\r\n\r\nHuman nature and human frailities were much the same in the\r\nseventeenth century as at the present time, and before long, the\r\nmagistrates considered it desirable to curb the extravagancies\r\nof dress that followed the London mode; and to induce a spirit\r\nof economy more fitting to the poverty of a new settlement. The\r\nministers controlled the lawmaking body and sumptuary laws were\r\nenacted which are enlightening. Because of \"newe and immodest\r\nfashions\" the wearing of silver, gold and silk laces, girdles and\r\nhat bands was prohibited. It was the fashion at that time to slash\r\nthe sleeves so that a fabric of another color worn beneath would\r\nshow in an ornamental manner through the slash. The ministers\r\ndecreed that neither man nor woman should wear clothing with more\r\nthan one slash on each sleeve and another on the back. \"Cutt-works,\r\ninbroidered or needle worke capps, bands & rayles,\" were\r\nforbidden.[31] Ruffs and beaver hats were prohibited, as was long\r\nhair. Binding or small edging laces might be used, but the making or\r\nselling of bone lace was penalized at the rate of five shillings per\r\nyard.\r\n\r\n  [31] _Records of the Mass. Bay Colony_, Vol. I, p. 126.\r\n\r\nBut this didn't change human nature and although from time to time\r\noffenders were taken into court and punished, the wearing of fine\r\nclothing fashioned after the London mode continued and a few years\r\nlater the ministers tried their hand again. Any kind of lace was\r\nanathema and \"no garment shalbee made with short sleeves, whereby\r\nthe nakedness of the arme may bee discovered.\" On the other hand,\r\nlarge sleeves were forbidden, so the maids and goodwives of the time\r\nmust have been somewhat at a loss to know how lawfully to fashion\r\ntheir clothes.\r\n\r\nThe minister at Ipswich grew so ill-tempered over the ungodly state\r\nof the women in his town that he vented his spleen as follows:\r\n\"When I hear a nugiperous Gentledame inquire what dress the Queen\r\nis in this week, what the nudius tertian of the Court, I look at\r\nher as the very gizzard of a trifle, the product of a quarter of a\r\ncypher, the epitome of nothing, fitter to be kickt, if she were of a\r\nkickable substance than either honoured or humoured.\"[32]\r\n\r\n  [32] Ward, _The Simple Cobler of Aggawam_, London, 1647.\r\n\r\nThe minister in the adjoining town, Rowley, actually cut off his\r\nnephew from his inheritance because he wore his hair long in the\r\nprevailing fashion. Later in the century the offense of wearing\r\nlong hair was forgotten in the unspeakable sin of wearing wigs. The\r\nGreat and General Court again took a hand and in 1675 condemned\r\n\"the practise of men's wearing their own or other's hair made into\r\nperiwigs.\" Judge Sewall in his _Diary_ alludes to the custom. In\r\n1685 three persons were admitted to the Old South Church in Boston.\r\n\"Two wore periwigs,\" comments the Judge.\r\n\r\n\"1708, Aug. 20, Mr. Chievar died. The Wellfare of the Province was\r\nmuch upon his Spirit. He abominated Periwigs.\"[33]\r\n\r\n  [33] _Sewall's Diary_, Vol. II, p. 231.\r\n\r\nThe Great and General Court at one time ordered that no person\r\nshould smoke tobacco in public under a penalty of two shillings\r\nand six pence, nor in his own house with a relative or friend. But\r\neverybody smoked who wanted to, even the maids, and the repressive\r\nlegislation in time met the usual fate of similar efforts to\r\nrestrain individual liberty and manners.\r\n\r\nIt is sweet to fancy Priscilla at her spinning wheel wearing the\r\ncoif and nun-like garb of the Puritan maiden of the poet and the\r\nartist. But the inventories of estate in the early years of the\r\nColony, as well as at a later time, furnish evidence of a different\r\ncharacter. The variety of fabrics listed is amazing and holds\r\nits own with the modern department store. There are most of the\r\nwell-known fabrics of today, such as calico, cambric, challis,\r\nflannel, lawn, linen, plush, serge, silk, velvet, and many others;\r\nand there are also names that sound strangely in modern ears, viz.:\r\ncheney, darnex, dowlas, genting, inckle, lockrum, ossembrike,\r\npennistone, perpetuana, sempiternum, stammell, and water paragon.\r\n\r\nAs for dress--the women wore bonnets, caps, silk hoods, coifs,\r\nforehead cloths, ruffs, and whisks. Gowns, cloaks, mantles, and\r\nmuffs are mentioned frequently; as are many kinds of lace and\r\neven fans and veils. Shawls and scarfs were not unknown and there\r\nwere gold, silver, and enamelled rings. Women possessed masks, and\r\nstomachers were not uncommon. Tortoise shell combs appear; all\r\nwell-to-do persons wore gloves, and as for shoes--there were shoes\r\nwith French heels, fall shoes, and those with silver buckles. Even\r\nshoe strings appear in the inventories. There were silver, pewter,\r\nand steel buttons and those of gympe, thread, and silk.\r\n\r\nLaboring men wore leather and coarse fabrics and for others there\r\nwere suits, doublets, waistcoats and breeches. Trousers are\r\nmentioned; also a cane and periwigs. Of caps and hats there were a\r\nnumber of kinds--felt, castor, demi-castor, and even straw. Capt.\r\nGeorge Corwin, a Salem merchant, owned a cloth coat trimmed with\r\nsilver lace, a velvet coat, a tabby doublet, an old-fashioned\r\nDutch satin doublet, four cloaks of various kinds, two pairs of\r\ngolden topped gloves, one embroidered pair, and a pair with black\r\nfringe. He also took his walks abroad wearing silk stockings, with\r\na hat encircled by a silver band and carrying a silver-headed cane\r\nor a plate hilt rapier, according to fashion. He possessed two\r\nsilver watches. Who shall say that the men and women of the New\r\nEngland colonies did not dress well and live well in the early days\r\naccording to their means?[34]\r\n\r\n  [34] In the inventory of the estate of Henry Landis of Boston,\r\n  Shopkeeper, deceased, taken, Dec. 17, 1651, appears his clothing,\r\n  viz.:\r\n\r\n    1 suite of fine broad cloth       £1.10.0\r\n    1 French serge suite,                18.0\r\n    1 Stuffe Cassoke & 1 pr breeches,    16.0\r\n    1 French serge Cassocke           £1. 0.0\r\n    1 pr red drawers,                     5.0\r\n    1 wascoate                            5.0\r\n    1 pr cotton breeches                  2.0\r\n    5 pr stockings & a hoode             12.0\r\n    1 hatte                               2.6\r\n\r\n    --_Suffolk Co. Probate Rds._, Vol. II, p. 127.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1600's, and until comparatively recent times, working\r\nmen very generally wore frocks, a custom in dress that dates\r\nback into the centuries. It was an almost universal custom for\r\nfarmers and those employed in the mechanic trades to wear a\r\nfrock. The farmer generally looked upon the frock as an outer\r\ngarment--something to put on in colder weather or to slip on to\r\nprotect underclothing or to conceal an untidy appearance. It was a\r\ngarment to take off on coming into the house or to put on when going\r\nto the village or to market.\r\n\r\nCarters or truckmen also habitually wore frocks. Drake, in his\r\n\"Landmarks of Boston,\" describes the old-time trucks, not to exceed\r\neighteen feet in length, with their loads of hogsheads of molasses\r\nand other heavy merchandise balanced on the one axle and the two\r\nhorses harnessed tandem, the head horse led by the truckman. With\r\nthe disappearance of these ponderous vehicles also went \"that\r\ndistinctive body of men, the 'Boston Truckmen,' who once formed\r\na leading and attractive feature of our public processions, with\r\ntheir white frocks and black hats, mounted with their magnificent\r\ntruck-horses. Hardy and athletic, it would be hard to find their\r\nequals on either side of the water. The long jiggers now used are\r\nscarcely less objectionable than the old trucks.\" Drake wrote this\r\nonly seventy-five years ago but the \"jiggers\" of his time have now\r\nalmost entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe frock was a loose garment slipped on over the head and in\r\nlength usually reached halfway between the knees and the feet. The\r\nopening in front reached from the neckband nearly to the waist and\r\nwas closed by buttons, though sometimes a gathering string was\r\nused. The bottom was cut up eight or ten inches, on the sides, to\r\npermit greater freedom in walking. There were long frocks and short\r\nfrocks, the latter being generally worn indoors. The frocks worn in\r\nworkshops by mechanics were short.\r\n\r\nOne early source of information exists in the advertisements of\r\nrunaway servants to be found in the eighteenth-century Boston\r\nnewspapers. During the quarter-century following 1725, the _Boston\r\nNews-Letter_ printed thirty-seven advertisements asking for the\r\ndetention of white male servants, twenty-one of whom ran away during\r\nthe cold-weather months. Of the latter, six wore frocks or carried\r\nfrocks in their bundle of clothing. It is fair to assume that some\r\nof these men may have taken with them only their best clothing and\r\nleft working garments behind, hence the small number of frocks\r\nspecifically mentioned. This possibly may have been the fact in\r\nthe instance of an Irish servant, aged twenty-six, who ran away in\r\nDecember, 1741, from his master, James Hunt of York, Maine. He wore\r\na broadcloth coat and jacket of a cinnamon color, a pair of orange\r\ncolored plush breeches and a good beaver hat. The reward for his\r\ndetention was £3.\r\n\r\nJohn Davis, a servant of Mr. Okenden of Boston, absented himself\r\nfrom service in March, 1728, and among other clothing he took with\r\nhim a brown fustian frock, and a pair of striped ticking breeches.\r\n\r\nFrocks and \"trouzers\" were part of the personal effects of William\r\nDavison, a tailor, in King Street, Boston, that were advertised for\r\nsale at public vendue in November, 1729.\r\n\r\nCharles Daly, an Irish boy, who ran away from his master in Boston,\r\nin December, 1732, wore a fustian frock and another Irish servant\r\nwho ran away from a brigantine at Boston four years later, wore a\r\nnew frock and trowsers.\r\n\r\nAn Irish servant of Captain Luce of Boston, a cooper by trade, took\r\nwith him when he disappeared in December, 1737, a frock and a pair\r\nof \"trowsers.\" Ten years later a negro servant who ran away from the\r\nNorth End of Boston, took with him a new ozen-brig frock.\r\n\r\nThe settlers came provided with English-made shoes it is likely of\r\na quality similar to those provided by John Hewsen in 1629, the\r\ncontract reading: \"To make eight pair of welt-neat's leather shoes,\r\ncrossed on the outside with a seam, to be substantial, good over\r\nleather of the best, and two soles, the inner sole of good neat's\r\nleather, and the outer of tallowed backs.\"[35] In 1651, the stock of\r\nRobert Turner of Boston, shoemaker, was inventoried as follows: 23\r\npairs of children's shoes at 9d. per pair; 29 pairs of No. 11, at\r\n4/4; of No. 12, at 4/8; of No. 13, at 4/10 per pair; 20 dozen wooden\r\nheels at 8d. per dozen; 14 pairs boots at 14/ per pair.\r\n\r\n  [35] _Records of the Massachusetts Bay Colony_, Boston, 1853, Vol.\r\n  I, p. 27.\r\n\r\nIn 1672, a committee of the town of Boston, considering that people\r\nin low circumstances \"will wear no other shoes or boots generally\r\nbut of the newest fashion and highest price\" proposed that a law\r\nshould be enacted that no shoemaker shall sell to any inhabitant,\r\nshoes of 11 or 12 sizes above five shillings a pair and so in\r\nproportion as to other sizes.[36]\r\n\r\n  [36] Felt, _The Customs of New England_, Boston, 1853.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half century following the arrival of the settlers,\r\nred colored stockings were much worn in New England and russet and\r\ngreen colored stockings were also in fashion. Stockings made of wash\r\nleather were worn. In 1675 cloth stockings sold at 14/ to 18/ a\r\ndozen pairs. In 1675 John Usher of Boston wrote to his principal in\r\nLondon: \"Your stirrups and turn-down stockings are not salable here.\"\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Bay Company sent over in its stock, in 1629, a\r\nhundred black hats made of wool and lined in the brim with leather\r\nand at the same time came one hundred Monmouth caps, so-called from\r\nthe place where they were manufactured, and valued at two shillings\r\neach. With them came five hundred red knit caps, milled, at five\r\npence each. Beaver hats were also worn at that time and in 1634\r\nprohibited by order of the General Court. In 1651, a shopkeeper in\r\nBoston, sold black hats at 14s. 16s. and 5s.; colored hats brought\r\n10s. and others, 8s.; children's were 3/6; black castors, 14s. and\r\ncoarse felt hats, 3s. each.\r\n\r\nIn 1675 a Bostonian wrote to a friend in London, that the local\r\nmarket for sugar-loaf or high-crowned hats was dull.\r\n\r\nThe Monmouth or military cocked hat, for men, began to come into\r\nfashion about 1670, with an average width of brim of six inches.\r\nTheir inconvenient width led to the practice of having one flap\r\nfastened to the side of the crown, either before or behind, and\r\nthen to having two flaps alike secured. During the reign of Queen\r\nAnne, the brim was caught up in three flaps, and so the triangularly\r\ncocked hat became the fashion.[37]\r\n\r\n  [37] Felt, _The Customs of New England_, Boston, 1853.\r\n\r\nDoublets were made of leather, usually red in color, and fastened\r\nwith hooks and eyes. They were large on the shoulders, having\r\nmuch cutwork showing the linen shirt beneath. Toward the end of\r\nthe century their popularity waned and they were succeeded by the\r\nwaistcoat. The jerkin was made of leather and also various kinds\r\nof cloth and sometimes is mentioned in inventories. It was worn by\r\nlaboring men.\r\n\r\nSNOW SHOES were used after a great storm; \"which our People do much\r\nuse now, that never did before.\"--_Boston News-Letter_, Jan. 29-Feb.\r\n5, 1704/5.\r\n\r\nSTOLEN or carried privately away out of the house of Capt.

Probate Records_, Vol. II, p. 127.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPEWTER IN THE EARLY DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1629, when the Secretary of the Company of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay in New England was preparing a memorandum of\r\nmaterials to be obtained \"to send for Newe England\" in the ships\r\nthat sailed on April 25th of that year, among the fabrics and food\r\nstuffs, the seed grain, potatoes, tame turkeys, and copper kettles\r\nof French making without bars of iron about them, were listed\r\nbrass ladles and spoons and \"pewter botles of pyntes & qrts.\" The\r\nlittle fleet reached Naumkeck (now Salem) on June 30th, and on its\r\nreturn voyage, a month later, Master Thomas Graves, the \"Engynere,\"\r\nexpert in mines, fortifications, and surveys, who had come over\r\nwith Governor Endecott the previous year, sent home a report to\r\nthe Company in which he listed \"such needefull things as every\r\nPlanter doth or ought to provide to go to New-England,\" including\r\nvictuals for a whole year, apparel, arms, tools, spices, and various\r\nhousehold implements, among which appear \"wooden platters, dishes,\r\nspoons and trenchers,\" with no mention of pewter. The records of the\r\nCompany make mention of carpenters, shoemakers, plasterers, vine\r\nplanters, and men skillful in making pitch, salt, etc., but nowhere\r\ndoes the trade of the pewterer appear.\r\n\r\nPewter did not come into general use among the more prosperous\r\nfarmers in England until about the middle of the sixteenth century\r\nand then only as a salt--a dish of honor, or three or four pieces\r\nfor use on more formal occasions. It was the wooden trencher that\r\nwas commonest in use in all middle-class families until well\r\nafter the year 1700, and this was true both in New England and\r\nOld England. In homes where the shilling was made to go as far as\r\npossible, the wooden trencher, like the homespun coat, lingered\r\nin use for a century later. At least one family in Essex County,\r\nMassachusetts, was still using its wooden plates of an earlier\r\nperiod as late as 1876, when the menfolk left home to work for two\r\nor three days in the early fall on the thatch banks beside Plum\r\nIsland river. And this happened in a comfortably situated, but\r\nthrifty, family. The rough usage given the common tableware in the\r\ncrude camp by the marshes had taught the housewife the desirability\r\nof bringing down from the chest in the attic, at least once a year,\r\nthe discarded wooden plates used in her childhood.\r\n\r\nPewter appears early in the Massachusetts Colony in connection\r\nwith the settlement of estates of deceased persons. By means of\r\nthe detailed inventories taken at such times, it is possible to\r\nreconstruct with unquestioned accuracy the manner in which the homes\r\nof the early settlers were furnished, and by means of this evidence\r\nit is possible to show that the hardships and crudities of the first\r\nyears were soon replaced by the usual comforts of the English home\r\nof similar station at the same time. The ships were crossing the\r\nAtlantic frequently and bringing from London, Plymouth or Bristol,\r\nto the new settlements, all manner of goods required for sale in the\r\nshops that had been set up in Boston, Salem and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn 1635 the widow Sarah Dillingham died at Ipswich, leaving a\r\nconsiderable estate. Among the bequests were a silver bowl and a\r\nsilver porringer, and the inventory shows 40-1/2 pounds of pewter\r\nvalued at £2.14.0.\r\n\r\nIn 1640, Bethia Cartwright of Salem bequeathed to her sister, Mary\r\nNorton, three pewter platters and a double saltcellar and to a\r\nnephew she gave six spoons and a porringer.\r\n\r\nIn 1643, Joseph, the eldest son of Robert Massey of Ipswich, was\r\nbequeathed by his father, four pewter platters and one silver spoon.\r\nBenjamin, another son, was to receive four pewter platters and two\r\nsilver spoons, and Mary, a daughter, received the same number as did\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\nIn 1645, Lionell Chute died in Ipswich. His silver spoon he\r\nbequeathed to his son James. It was the only piece of silver in\r\nthe house. Of pewter, he had possessed fourteen dishes, \"small and\r\ngreat,\" eleven pewter salts, saucers and porringers, two pewter\r\ncandlesticks and a pewter bottle.\r\n\r\nThe widow, Mary Hersome of Wenham, possessed in 1646 one pewter\r\nplatter and two spoons. The same year Michael Carthrick of Ipswich\r\npossessed ten pewter dishes, two quart pots, one pint pot, one\r\nbeaker, a little pewter cup, one chamber pot and a salt. In 1647,\r\nWilliam Clarke, a prosperous Salem merchant, died possessed of an\r\ninteresting list of furniture; six silver spoons and two small\r\npieces of plate; and the following pewter which was kept in the\r\nkitchen--twenty platters, two great plates and ten little ones, one\r\ngreat pewter pot, one flagon, one pottle, one quart, three pints,\r\nfour ale quarts, one pint, six beer cups, four wine cups, four\r\ncandlesticks, five chamber pots, two lamps, one tunnel, six saucers\r\nand miscellaneous old pewter, the whole valued at £7. The household\r\nalso was supplied with \"China dishes\" valued at twelve shillings.\r\nJohn Lowell of Newbury, in 1647, possessed three pewter butter\r\ndishes. John Fairfield of Wenham, the same year, had two pewter\r\nfruit dishes and two saucers; also four porringers, a double salt,\r\none candlestick and six spoons, all of pewter. His fellow-townsman,\r\nChristopher Yongs, a weaver, who died the same year, possessed one\r\nbason, a drinking pot, three platters, three old saucers, a salt and\r\nan old porringer, all of pewter and valued at only ten shillings.\r\nThere were also alchemy spoons, trenchers and dishes and a pipkin\r\nvalued at one shilling and sixpence.\r\n\r\nWhen Giles Badger of Newbury died in 1647 he left to his young\r\nwidow a glass bowl, beaker and jug, valued at three shillings;\r\nthree silver spoons valued at £1, and a good assortment of pewter,\r\nincluding \"a salt seller, a tunnell, a great dowruff\" and valued\r\nat one shilling. The household was also furnished with six wooden\r\ndishes and two wooden platters. The inventory of the estate\r\nof Matthew Whipple of Ipswich totalled £287.2.1, and included\r\neighty-five pieces of pewter, weighing 147 pounds and valued at\r\n£16.9.16. In addition, there were four pewter candlesticks valued\r\nat ten shillings; two pewter salts, five shillings; two pewter\r\npotts, one cup and a bottle, four shillings and sixpence; one pewter\r\nflagon, seven shillings; twenty-one \"brass alchimic spoones\" at four\r\nshillings and four pence each; and nine pewter spoons at eighteen\r\npence per dozen. The inventory also discloses one silver bowl and\r\ntwo silver spoons valued at £3.3.0; six dozen wooden trenchers,\r\nvalued at three shillings; also trays, a platter, two bowles, four\r\ndishes, and \"one earthen salt.\"\r\n\r\nThe widow Rebecca Bacon died in Salem in 1655, leaving an estate of\r\n£195.8.6 and a well-furnished house. She had brass pots, skillets,\r\ncandlesticks, skimmers, a little brass pan, and an excellent supply\r\nof pewter, including \"3 large pewter platters, 3 a size lesse, 3\r\nmore a size lesse, 3 more a size lesse, £1.16; 1 pewter bason,\r\n5s; 6 large pewter plates & 6 lesser, 9s; 19 Pewter saucers & 2\r\nfruite dishes, 11s, 6d; 1 old Pewter bason & great plate, 3s; 2\r\npewter candlesticks, 4s; 1 large pewter salt & a smal one; 2 pewter\r\nporringers, 3s.6d; 1 great pewter flagon; 1 lesser, 1 quart, 2 pints\r\n& a halfe pint, 13s; 2 old chamber pots & an old porringer, 3s.\" She\r\nalso died possessed of \"1 duble salt silver, 6 silver spones, 1 wine\r\ncup & a dram cup of silver, both £6.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. James Noyes of Newbury, when he died in 1656, was possessed\r\nof an unusually well-equipped kitchen, supplied with much brass\r\nand ironware and the following pewter, viz.: \"on one shelfe, one\r\ncharger, 5 pewter platters and a bason and a salt seller, £1.10.0;\r\non another shelfe, 9 pewter platters, small & great, 13 shillings;\r\none old flagon and 4 pewter drinking pots, 10 shillings.\" No pewter\r\nplates or wooden trenchers are listed.\r\n\r\nIn other estates appear some unusual items, such as: a pewter brim\r\nbasin, pewter cullenders, pewter beer cups, pewter pans, pewter bed\r\npans, and a mustard pot.\r\n\r\nThe trade of the pewterer does not seem to have been followed by\r\nmany men in New England during the seventeenth century. The vessels\r\nwere bringing shipments from London and moreover, the bronze moulds\r\nused in making the ware were costly. Pewter melted easily and\r\nfrequently required repairing, and it was here that the itinerant\r\ntinker or second-rate pewterer found employment. The handles of\r\npewter spoons broke easily, and a spoon mould was a part of the\r\nequipment of every tinker. The earliest mention we have noted of\r\nthe pewterer practising his trade in New England is one Richard\r\nGraves of Salem. He was presented at a Quarterly Court on February\r\n28, 1642-43 for \"opression in his trade of pewtering\" and acquitted\r\nof the charge. Then he was accused of neglecting to tend the ferry\r\ncarefully, so it would seem that pewtering occupied only part of\r\nhis time. This he acknowledged, but said that he had not been put\r\nto it by the Court and also that it was necessary to leave the\r\nferry when he went to mill, a quite apparent fact. He seems to have\r\nbeen a somewhat reckless fellow in his dealings with neighbors, for\r\nhe was accused of taking fence rails from Christopher Young's lot\r\nand admonished by the Court. At the same session he was fined for\r\nstealing wood from Thomas Edwards and for evil speeches to him,\r\ncalling him \"a base fellow, & yt one might Runn a half pike in his\r\nbellie & never touch his hart.\"\r\n\r\nGraves came to Massachusetts in the \"Abigail,\" arriving in July,\r\n1635. He settled at Salem and was a proprietor there in 1637.\r\nSometimes he is styled \"husbandman.\" He got into trouble with the\r\nauthorities very soon, and in December, 1638, was sentenced to sit\r\nin the stocks for beating Peter Busgutt in his own house. Peter made\r\nsport of the Court at the time of the trial, and in consequence was\r\nordered to be whipped, this time by the constable. In 1641 Graves\r\nwas brought into court again and William Allen testified that \"he\r\nherd Rich Graves kissed Goody Gent twice.\" Richard confessed that it\r\nwas true, and for this unseemly conduct he was sentenced to be fined\r\nor whipped. The records do not disclose his individual preference\r\nas to the penalty eventually inflicted. In 1645 he was in Boston\r\nin connection with some brazen moulds that were in dispute. A Mr.\r\nHill and Mr. Knott were concerned in the affair, and very likely\r\nthe moulds were for pewterers' use. On another occasion a few years\r\nlater, when Graves went to Boston, he got drunk at Charlestown, and\r\nin consequence was mulct by the Quarterly court. Only a month later\r\nhe was complained of for playing at shuffleboard, a wicked game of\r\nchance, at the tavern kept by Mr. Gedney in Salem, but this time he\r\nescaped the vengeance of the law, for the case against him was not\r\nproved. He was still pursuing his trade of pewterer in 1655 when\r\nhe so styled himself in a deed to John Putnam, and sometime between\r\nthat date and 1669 he passed out of reach of the courts to that\r\nbourne from which no pewterers ever return.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the fact that London-made pewter was\r\nbrought into New England at frequent intervals to supply the natural\r\ndemand. An invoice of pewter shipped from London in 1693 has\r\nrecently come to light in the Massachusetts Archives, and is here\r\nprinted as being of interest not only as showing the market prices\r\nfor pewter, but also the kind of utensils in demand at that time.\r\nThis particular shipment of pewter was a part of a consignment made\r\nby John Caxy of London to Joseph Mallenson, his agent in Boston.\r\nIt consisted of a great variety of clothing, fabrics, hardware,\r\nimplements, kitchen utensils and pewter. The part of the invoice\r\nthat comprised the shipment of pewter follows, viz.:\r\n\r\n     One Drume Fatt No. 2 Containing\r\n  12 Pottle Tankards at 3s 10d ps                £2. 6.0\r\n  12 Quart ditto at 3s                            1.16.0\r\n  24 Midle ditto at 2/6                           3. 0.0\r\n  24 Small ditto at 2/                            2. 8.0\r\n  12 doz: Large Poringers at 9s 6d p doz          5.14.0\r\n  12 doz: Small ditto at 8/                       4.16.0\r\n   3 pr New-fashon'd Candlesticks at 4s             12.0\r\n   3 pr ditto at 3s                                  9.0\r\n   2 pr Round ditto at 2s 10d                        5.8\r\n     a Fatt Cost                                     7.0\r\n     One Drume Fatt No. 3 quantity\r\n  18 Large Chamber Potts at 2/10s ps              2.11.0\r\n  30 Middle ditto at 2s 8d                        3.10.0\r\n  40 small ditto at 2s                            3.10.0\r\n  12 doz Alcamy Spoons at 2/9                     4. 0.0\r\n  24 doz Powder ditto at 2/3d p doz               2.14.0\r\n  12 Large Salts at 2s 2 ps                       1. 6.0\r\n  24 Middle ditto at 20d ps                       2. 0.0\r\n  48 Small ditto at 12d ps                        2. 8.0\r\n  18 Basons qt 32 at 12d                          1.12.6\r\n   2 doz: Sawcers at 9s p doz                       18.0\r\n   4 doz Small ditto at 7s p doz                  1. 8.0\r\n   2 Pottle Wine Measure Potts at 5/6               11.0\r\n   6 Quart ditto Potts at 2/8                       16.0\r\n   6 Pint ditto Potts at 22d ps                     11.0\r\n   6 halfe Pint ditto at 14d                         7.0\r\n   6 Quartern ditto Potts at 9d p ps                 4.6\r\n    a Fatt Cost 7s                                   7.0\r\n    One halfe Barell Fatt No 4 cont more pewter\r\n  78 dishes qt 265 at 9d-1/2                     10. 9.91/2\r\n    A Fatt Cost 3s 6                              3. 6\r\n                                                ----------\r\n                                                £76. 2.5-1/2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE FARMHOUSE AND THE FARMER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farmers in the early days had few conveniences and comforts\r\nand were largely dependent for the supply of their wants upon the\r\nproducts of their farms. But little food was purchased. At the\r\noutset domestic animals were too valuable to be killed for food but\r\ndeer and other wild game were plentiful. When this no longer became\r\nnecessary and an animal was killed by a farmer, it was the custom to\r\nlend pieces of the meat to the neighbors, to be repaid in kind when\r\nanimals were killed by them. In this way the fresh meat supply was\r\nkept up for a long time by the killing of one animal. Other parts\r\nof the meat were salted and kept for a number of months before all\r\nwas eaten. Nearly every family had a beef and a pork barrel (called\r\na \"powdering tub\"), from which most of the meat used in summer was\r\ntaken. Meat was not found upon the table every day.\r\n\r\nThe chimney in the farmhouse was of great size, occupying relatively\r\na large amount of the space inside the house. The kitchen fireplace\r\nusually was large enough to accommodate logs four feet in length,\r\noftentimes even larger. In making a fire a backlog, a foot or\r\nmore in diameter, was placed against the back of the fireplace; a\r\nforestick was then placed across the andirons in front, and wood\r\npiled between, producing a hot fire, and giving the kitchen a very\r\ncheerful appearance. Large stones were sometimes used instead of a\r\nbacklog, and an iron bar was laid on the andirons in front of the\r\nforestick. Ample ventilation was had by the constant current of air\r\nthat passed up the chimney.\r\n\r\nIn sitting before an open fire it was often complained that while\r\none was roasted in front he was frozen in the back and this led to\r\nthe use in nearly every family of a long seat made of boards called\r\na \"settle,\" with a high back to keep off the wind from behind,\r\nwhich, when placed before the fire, was usually occupied by the\r\nolder members of the family.\r\n\r\nAt night, any fire that remained was carefully covered with ashes\r\nand was expected to keep until morning to kindle for the next day.\r\nThis was called \"raking up the fire,\" and calculation was made to\r\nhave enough fire to cover up every night, so it need not be lost.\r\nIf the fire didn't keep over, some one would go with a fire pan to\r\na neighbor, if one lived near, and borrow some fire. But if this\r\nwas inconvenient, resort was then had to the tinder box. Tinder\r\nwas made by charring cotton or linen rags. The box containing this\r\nwas usually kept in a niche made in the side of the fireplace,\r\nby leaving out a couple of bricks. By striking fire with flint\r\nand steel, the tinder was ignited. Homemade matches, which had\r\nbeen dipped in melted brimstone, were set on fire by touching the\r\nburning tinder and in this way a fire was obtained. Sometimes fire\r\nwas kindled by flashing powder in the pan of a flint-lock musket,\r\nthereby setting paper on fire. Friction matches did not come into\r\nuse until about 1832.\r\n\r\nThe cooking was done over and before the open fire. Boiling was\r\ndone by suspending kettles from pot hooks which were upon the crane\r\nand of different lengths to accommodate the height of the fire. An\r\nadjustable hook which was called a \"trammel\" was not infrequently\r\nused. Meat was roasted by passing through it an iron rod called a\r\nspit and this was rested on brackets on the back of the andirons in\r\nfront of the fire and by repeated turning and exposing on all sides,\r\nthe meat was evenly cooked. Another method was to suspend the meat\r\nor poultry by a line before the fire. By twisting the line hard\r\nit would slowly unwind. Of course some one had to be in frequent\r\nattendance to twist the cords and usually it was a child. A dish\r\nplaced underneath caught the drippings from the roast. Sometimes\r\nthe line would burn off, and have to be replaced before the cooking\r\ncould be completed.\r\n\r\nPotatoes and eggs were roasted in the ashes by wrapping them in wet\r\nleaves or paper, and then covering with hot coals. In half an hour\r\nor so the potatoes would be well cooked.\r\n\r\nAt first bread and other things were baked in a Dutch oven. It was\r\na shallow cast-iron kettle with long legs and a cover of the same\r\nmaterial, having a raised edge. The cover was filled with live\r\ncoals, and then the oven was suspended from a pot hook or stood\r\nin the hot coals. It was used for both baking and frying. Indian\r\nbannock, made from corn meal mixed with water and spread about an\r\ninch thick on a board or wooden trencher, was baked before the fire\r\nby setting it on an incline against a sad-iron or skillet, the top a\r\ncouple of inches back from the bottom, and when baked and made into\r\nmilk toast it was considered a dish fit to be \"set before a king\"!\r\n\r\nThe brick oven was in the chimney of nearly every well-built house.\r\nThe opening was inside the fireplace and was closed by a wooden\r\ndoor. In heating the oven dry pine wood, which had been spilt and\r\nseasoned out of doors for a short time and then housed, was a\r\nnecessity for the best results. The oven was considered hot enough\r\nfor a baking when the black was burned off the roof and the whole\r\ninside had assumed a uniform light color. The coals and ashes inside\r\nthe oven were then removed with a \"peel,\" a long-handled iron\r\nshovel made for the purpose. The bottom of the oven was then swept\r\nclean with a broom made of hemlock or other boughs. The process of\r\nremoving the fire and getting it ready for use was called \"clearing\r\nthe oven.\"\r\n\r\nThe food to be cooked was then put in the oven: brown bread made\r\nfrom rye and Indian meal, drop cakes made with milk and eggs and\r\nwheat flour, which were placed directly upon the bricks and when\r\nbaked and eaten hot with butter, were considered a great luxury.\r\nBeans, meats, potatoes, pies, and many other things were cooked in\r\nthe brick oven at the same time.\r\n\r\nFamilies in good circumstances, made it a rule to heat the oven\r\ndaily, but Saturday was generally reserved for the week's baking.\r\n\r\nThe skins of animals killed on the farm were tanned by some local\r\ntanner and a year or more was required by the old process, but it\r\nproduced an excellent quality of leather.\r\n\r\nThe utmost economy was practiced. Nearly all the young people and\r\nsome of the older ones went barefoot during the summer. In going to\r\nmeeting on Sunday the girls and young women often walked a number\r\nof miles. They wore heavy shoes or went barefooted, carrying their\r\nlight shoes in their hands to save wear until near the meeting house.\r\n\r\nIn the early years following the settlement, all clothing or\r\nmaterials were brought from overseas but in time, flax and wool were\r\nproduced on many farms, and the women of the family were capable of\r\ntaking the wool as it came from the sheep, cleansing, carding and\r\nspinning it into yarn, and then weaving it into cloth, from which\r\nthey cut and made the clothes for the family. The carding was done\r\nwith hand cards similar to those used for carding cattle, only a\r\nlittle larger and of finer mesh. The carded rolls were spun into\r\nyarn upon the hand wheel. Five skeins was considered a good day's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe yarn was woven into cloth on the hand loom, which was a\r\nponderous affair and occupied a great deal of room. Not every family\r\npossessed a loom, but there were weavers in every locality. The yarn\r\nwhich went lengthwise of the cloth had to be drawn into the harness\r\nby hand; that which went the other way came from the shuttle. The\r\nyarn which was in the shuttle was wound upon short quills, which\r\nwere pieces of elder three inches in length with the pitch punched\r\nout, and these quills were wound on a wheel called a \"quill wheel\"\r\nwhich made a great deal of noise. This work was usually done by\r\nchildren or some helper, while the woman of the house was weaving.\r\n\r\nWeaving was hard work and five or six yards was considered a good\r\nday's work. Cotton was sometimes bought and worked in about the same\r\nmanner as wool. When the yarn was to be knitted, it was generally\r\ncolored before using. The dye pot was of earthenware and had its\r\nplace in the chimney corner just inside the fireplace. It was\r\ncovered with a piece of board or plank on which the children often\r\nsat. The dye was made of indigo dissolved in urine. Into this the\r\nyarn was put and remained until it was colored. When the yarn was\r\nwrung out, or the contents disturbed, the odor that arose had no\r\nresemblance to the balmy breezes from \"Araby the blest.\"\r\n\r\nThe cloth for men's wear was called \"fulled cloth.\" After it was\r\nwoven it was taken to the clothier, where it was fulled, dyed,\r\nsheared, and pressed. That worn by women was simply dyed and\r\npressed, and was called pressed cloth. Baize without any filling or\r\nnapping was woven for women's use.\r\n\r\nFlax was grown on the farm. It was pulled in the fall and placed\r\nupon the ground, where it remained a number of months until the\r\nwoody portion was rotted and the fiber became pliable. When at\r\nthe right stage it was broken by a clumsy implement called a\r\n\"flax brake,\" which rid the fiber of the woody parts. It was then\r\n\"swingled,\" which was done by beating it with a wooden paddle called\r\na \"swingling knife,\" which prepared it for the comb or \"hatchel\"\r\nmade of nail rods. Its teeth were pointed and about six inches\r\nlonger, seven rows with twelve in each row. The combing took out the\r\nshort and broken pieces which was called tow and spun into wrapping\r\ntwine, small ropes and bagging. When the flax had been combed\r\nsufficiently it was put upon the distaff and spun.\r\n\r\nThe linen wheel was about twenty inches in diameter and was operated\r\nby the foot resting upon a treadle. The wheel had two grooves in\r\nthe circumference, one to receive a band to drive \"the fliers,\"\r\nthe other to drive the spool with a quicker motion to take up the\r\nthreads. The thread when spun and woven into cloth, was made up\r\ninto shirts, sheets, table covers, dresses, handkerchiefs, strainer\r\ncloths, etc. Ropes used about the farm were often home-made of linen\r\nand tow. In the summer men wore tow and linen clothes. A cloth made\r\nof cotton and linen was called fustian.\r\n\r\nCider mills were found on a great many farms where the apples, which\r\nwere mostly natural fruit, were made into cider. This was a common\r\ndrink and found a place upon the table three times a day with each\r\nmeal, and was carried into the fields to quench thirst forenoon\r\nand afternoon. The men of those days assumed to be unable to labor\r\nwithout a liberal supply of cider, as water seldom agreed with them.\r\nThe drawing and putting the cider upon the table usually fell to\r\nthe younger members of the family and was generally considered an\r\nirksome task. In some cases it was made the rule that the one who\r\ngot up the latest in the morning should draw the cider for the day.\r\nCider which had been drawn for a little time and had become warm\r\nwas not considered fit to drink. Any that remained in the mug was\r\nemptied into a barrel kept for the purpose in the cellar and was\r\nsoon converted into vinegar. In this way the family supply was made\r\nand kept up, and it generally was of the best quality.\r\n\r\nWhen David Cummings of Topsfield died in 1761, he provided by will\r\nthat his wife Sarah should be supplied annually with five barrels of\r\ncider, in fact, it was common among farmers to so provide for their\r\nwidows, together with a horse to ride to meeting, and a certain\r\nnumber of bushels of vegetables, corn, rye, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe tallow candle was used for light in the evening. When this was\r\nsupplemented by a blazing fire in the fireplace it gave the room a\r\ncheerful appearance. Most of the candles were \"dips,\" although a few\r\nwere run in moulds made for the purpose. All the tallow that came\r\nfrom the animals killed on the farm was carefully saved and tried\r\nout and rendered by heating. The liquid thus obtained was put in\r\npans to cool and when enough had been accumulated it was placed in\r\na large kettle and melted. The candle wicking was made of cotton,\r\nand was bought at the shops in town. It came in balls. The wicking\r\nwas cut twice the length of the candle and doubled over a stick made\r\nfor the purpose and then twisted together. These sticks were two\r\nfeet in length and half an inch in diameter. Six wicks were placed\r\nupon each stick, and as many used as would hold all the candles to\r\nbe made at one time. Two sticks six or eight feet in length, often\r\nold rake handles, were used for supports. These were placed upon\r\ntwo chairs and about eighteen inches apart. On these the sticks\r\nwere placed with the wicks hanging down. By taking a couple of the\r\nsticks in the hands the wicks were placed in the hot tallow until\r\nthey were soaked. When all had been thus treated dipping began. Each\r\ntime a little tallow adhered, which was allowed to cool, care being\r\ntaken not to allow the dips to remain in the hot tallow long enough\r\nto melt off what had already cooled. While the dipping was going on\r\nthe candles were suspended where a draft of air would pass over\r\nand cause them to cool quickly. Care was also taken not to have the\r\ncandles touch each other.\r\n\r\nThe dipping continued until the candles were large enough for use.\r\nIf the tallow in the kettle became too cool to work well, some\r\nboiling water was put in which went to the bottom and kept the\r\ntallow above warm enough to work. The tallow candle made a dim,\r\ndisagreeable light, as it smoked considerably and required constant\r\nsnuffing or cutting off of the burnt portions of the wick. Snuffers\r\nwere used for this purpose, in which the portions of the wick cut\r\noff were retained, and this was emptied from time to time as the\r\nreceptacle became filled.\r\n\r\nNearly every family made the soft soap used in washing clothes and\r\nfloors. Ashes were carefully saved and stored in a dry place. In\r\nthe spring the mash tub, holding sixty or seventy gallons, was set\r\nup, and on the bottom a row of bricks were set on edge. On them a\r\nframework was placed which was covered with hemlock boughs or straw,\r\nover which a porous cloth was placed. The tub was then filled with\r\nashes. If any doubt existed as to the strength of the lye, thus\r\nproduced, a little lime was put in. Boiling water was then poured on\r\nin small quantities, at frequent intervals and this was allowed to\r\nsettle. When no more water would be taken it was left to stand an\r\nhour or more, when the first lye was drawn off. If an egg dropped\r\ninto the lye floated, all was well and good luck with the soap was\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nAshes from any wood except pine and beech were considered good\r\nand used with confidence. Grease that had accumulated during the\r\nyear and been saved for this purpose was then placed in a kettle\r\nwith some of the lye, and when boiled, if it did not separate when\r\ncooled, soft soap was the result. Most farmers' wives dreaded soap\r\nmaking. It was one of the hardest day's work of the year. Usually it\r\nwas made a point to have the soap making precede the spring cleaning.\r\n\r\nMen generally rode horseback to meeting and elsewhere, and when a\r\nwoman went along she rode behind on a pillion, which was a small\r\ncushion attached to the rear of the saddle with a narrow board\r\nsuspended from the cushion--a support for the women's feet. To\r\nassist in mounting and dismounting horse blocks were used at the\r\nmeetinghouse and in other public places. Small articles were carried\r\nin saddle-bags, balanced one on each side of the horse. Grain was\r\ncarried to mill laid across the horse's back, half in each end of\r\nthe sack.\r\n\r\nIn the early days baked pumpkin and milk was a favorite dish. A\r\nhard-shelled pumpkin had a hole cut in the stem end large enough to\r\nadmit the hand. The seeds and inside tissue were carefully removed,\r\nthe piece cut out was replaced, and the pumpkin was then put in a\r\nhot oven. When cooked it was filled with new milk and the contents\r\neaten with a spoon. When emptied the shells were often used as\r\nreceptacles for balls of yarn, remnants of cloth and other small\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nBean porridge was another dish that was popular. In cold weather it\r\nwas often made in large quantities and considered to grow better\r\nwith age. Hence the old saying:\r\n\r\n    \"Bean porridge hot;\r\n     Bean porridge cold;\r\n     Bean porridge in the pot,\r\n     Nine days old.\"\r\n\r\nWhile iron shovels were brought in from England and in a limited way\r\nwere made by local blacksmiths, most shovels used by farmers were\r\nmade of oak, the edges shod with iron. Hay and manure forks were\r\nmade of iron by the blacksmith. They were heavy, had large tines\r\nthat bent easily, and were almost always loose in the handle. It\r\ntook a great deal of strength to use them. Hoes were made by the\r\nblacksmiths, who also made axes, scythes, knives, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen help was wanted on the farm, the son of some neighbor who was\r\nnot as well off, or who had not enough work to profitably employ\r\nall his sons, could be hired. He became one of the family, took\r\nan active interest in his employer's business, and in not a few\r\ninstances married his daughter, and later with his wife succeeded\r\nto the ownership of the farm. If help was wanted in the house, some\r\ngirl in the neighborhood was willing to accept the place. She was\r\nstrong and ready, capable and honest, and in the absence of her\r\nmistress was able to take the lead. She was not looked upon as a\r\nservant, and often established herself permanently by becoming the\r\nlife partner of the son.\r\n\r\nClocks were seldom found in the farmhouse. Noon marks and sundials\r\nanswered the needs of the family and when the day was cloudy, one\r\nmust \"guess.\" Because so many had no means of telling the time, it\r\nwas customary to make appointments for \"early candlelight.\"\r\n\r\nIt was usual with most families to gather roots and herbs to be used\r\nfor medicinal purposes. Catnip, pennyroyal, sage, thoroughwort,\r\nspearmint, tansy, elderblows, wormwood, and other plants were saved\r\nto be used in case of sickness. Gold thread or yellow root was saved\r\nand was a remedy for canker in the mouth. Many of the old women who\r\nhad reared families of children were skilful in the use of these\r\nremedies, and were sent for in case of sickness, and would prescribe\r\nteas made from some of these herbs, which were cut when in bloom and\r\ntied in small bundles and suspended from the rafters on the garret\r\nto dry, causing a pleasant aromatic smell in the upper part of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe well was usually at some distance from the farmhouse and often\r\nlocated in an exposed and wind-swept position requiring much daily\r\ntravel over a snowy and slippery path in winter and through mud and\r\nwet at other times. Convenience in the location of the well was in\r\ntoo many cases overlooked. From the well all the water used for\r\ndomestic purposes was brought into the house in buckets. The water\r\nin the well was usually drawn by means of a well-sweep.\r\n\r\nIn some towns the selectmen were chosen by \"pricking.\" A number of\r\nnames were written upon a sheet of paper. This was passed around\r\nand each man pricked a hole against the names of his choice. The\r\none having the most pin holes was chosen first selectman, the next\r\nhighest the second, and the next the third.\r\n\r\nWhen a couple concluded to marry they made known their intention to\r\nthe town clerk, who posted a notice of their intended marriage in\r\nthe meetinghouse. This was called \"being published.\" By law this\r\nnotice must be published three Sabbaths before the ceremony was\r\nperformed, so that any one who knew of any reason why such marriage\r\nshould not take place might appear and make objection. In addition\r\nto the posting, the town clerk would rise in the meeting and read\r\nthe intention to marry.\r\n\r\nEach landowner not only maintained his own fences around cultivated\r\nfields, but also gave of his labor in building long ranges of\r\nfencing about the common pasture lands in proportion to his interest\r\nin the land. A law was enacted as early as 1633 requiring the\r\nfencing of corn fields.\r\n\r\nThe earliest fences were usually made of five rails and must be up\r\nby early in April when the cattle and hogs were turned out to roam\r\nat large. The New England farmer, clearing his land for cultivation,\r\nsoon devised another form of fence where stones were plentiful and\r\nby piling up these stones into walls divided off his fields and\r\ngave them substantial protection. The well-built stone wall must\r\nhave a foundation of small stones laid in a trench to prevent its\r\nbeing thrown by the frost and when carefully built it would last\r\nfor generations. Meanwhile the adjoining field had been cleared\r\nof stones and made useful for cultivation. Hedge fences were also\r\nin frequent use as in parts of England whence the settlers had\r\nemigrated.\r\n\r\nThe roads outside the villages were seldom fenced. In fact, the\r\nearly roads were little more than ill-defined paths winding their\r\nway across pastures and cultivated fields and whenever a dividing\r\nfarm was reached, there would be a gate or bars to be opened and\r\nclosed by the traveler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMANNERS AND CUSTOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the first considerable emigration ceased about the year\r\n1640, of the 25,000 settlers then living in the Colony, probably\r\nninety-five per cent were small farmers or workmen engaged in the\r\nmanual trades, together with many indentured servants who had come\r\nover under the terms of a contract whereby they were bonded to\r\nserve their masters for a term of years--usually five or seven. The\r\nremaining five per cent of the population was composed of those\r\ngoverning the colony--the stockholders in the Company, so to speak;\r\nministers enough to supply the spiritual needs of each town and\r\nsettlement, however small; a few of social position and comparative\r\nwealth; one lawyer; and a sprinkling of shopkeepers and small\r\nmerchants living in the seaport towns. Here and there a physician\r\nor chirurgeon might be found, but the physical welfare of the\r\nsmaller towns was usually cared for by some ancient housewife with\r\na knowledge of herbs and simples. Sometimes it was the minister who\r\npracticed two professions and cared for the bodies as well as the\r\nsouls of his congregation.\r\n\r\nThe founders of the colony in the Massachusetts Bay, and most of\r\nthose who immediately followed them, were men who did not conform to\r\nthe ritual and government of the Established Church in England. They\r\nwere followers of John Calvin whose Geneva Bible was widely read\r\nin England and whose teachings had profoundly influenced English\r\nthought and manners. Calvin taught a great simplicity of life and\r\na personal application of the teachings found in the Bible. In the\r\nCommonwealth that he set up in Geneva, the daily life and actions\r\nof its citizens were as closely guarded as if in a nursery for\r\nchildren. All frivolous amusements were forbidden; a curfew was\r\nestablished; and all were constrained to save souls and to labor for\r\nmaterial development. There was a minute supervision of dress and\r\npersonal conduct, and a literal construction of Bible mandates was\r\ncarried so far that children were actually put to death for striking\r\ntheir parents.\r\n\r\nCalvin's theology was based on the belief that all men were born\r\nsinners and since Adam's fall, by the will of God, predestined\r\nfrom birth to hell and everlasting torment, unless, happily, one\r\nof the elect and so foreordained to be saved. In this belief the\r\nPuritans found life endurable because they considered themselves of\r\nthe elect; and in cases of doubt, the individual found comfortable\r\nassurance in the belief that although certain of his neighbors were\r\ngoing to hell _he_ was one of the elect. It naturally followed that\r\nthe imagination of the Puritans was concentrated on questions of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThe teachings of Calvin spread rapidly in England and among his\r\nfollowers there came about an austerity of religious life and a\r\ngreat simplicity in dress and manners.\r\n\r\nIt is true that most of the settlers of Massachusetts were poor in\r\npurse and with many of them mere existence was a struggle for a long\r\ntime. But the growth of wealth in the Colony, although it brought\r\nwith it more luxury in living and better dwellings, did not add much\r\nto the refinement of the people. It was the influence and example\r\nof the royal governors and a more frequent commercial intercourse\r\nwith England and the Continental peoples that brought about a desire\r\nfor a richer dress and an introduction of some of the refinements\r\nof life. This by no means met the approval of the Puritan ministers\r\nwho frequently inveighed against \"Professors of Religion who fashion\r\nthemselves according to the World.\" The Rev. Cotton Mather, the\r\nleading minister in Boston and the industrious author of over\r\nfour hundred published sermons and similar works, again and again\r\nexhorted against stage plays and infamous games of cards and dice.\r\n\"It is a matter of Lamentation that even such things as these should\r\nbe heard of in New England,\" he exclaimed. \"And others spend their\r\ntime in reading vain Romances,\" he continued. \"It is meer loss of\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nWith such a background and burdened with such a far-reaching\r\nantagonism toward the finer things of life, that help to lighten the\r\nburden of existence and beautify the way, it is small wonder that\r\nthe esthetics found little fertile soil in New England; and much of\r\nthis prejudice and state of mind lingered among the old families in\r\nthe more remote and orthodox communities, until recent times.\r\n\r\nThe New England Puritans only allowed themselves one full holiday\r\nin the course of the year and that was Thanksgiving Day, a time\r\nfor feasting. To be sure, there was Fast Day, in the spring,\r\nwhich gave freedom from work; but that was a day for a sermon\r\nat the meetinghouse, for long faces and a supposed bit of self\r\ndenial--somewhere. The celebration of Christmas was not observed\r\nby the true New England Puritan until the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nA number of sermons preached by Rev. Samuel Moodey, an eccentric\r\nminister at York, Maine, for nearly half a century, were printed\r\nand among them: \"The Doleful State of the Damned, especially such\r\nas go to hell from under the Gospel.\" This sermon was followed by\r\nits antidote, entitled: \"The Gospel Way of Escaping the Doleful\r\nState of the Damned.\" Another of his sermons was upon \"Judas the\r\nTraitor, Hung up in Chains.\" Parson Moodey's son, Joseph, followed\r\nhim in the pulpit at York. He was known as \"Handkerchief Moodey,\"\r\nas he fell into a melancholy; thought he had sinned greatly; and\r\nafter a time wore a handkerchief over his face whenever he appeared\r\nin public. In the pulpit he would turn his back to the congregation\r\nand read the sermon, but whenever he faced his people it would\r\nbe with handkerchief-covered features. Think what must have been\r\nthe influence of two such men on the life and opinions of a town\r\ncovering a period of two generations!\r\n\r\nDuring the late seventeenth century and well into the eighteenth,\r\nthe books usually found in the average New England family were\r\nthe Bible, the Psalm Book, an almanac, the New England Primer, a\r\nsermon or two and perhaps a copy of Michael Wigglesworth's terrific\r\npoem--\"The Day of Doom.\" The latter was first printed in 1662 in\r\nan edition of 1800 copies not one of which has survived. Every\r\ncopy was read and re-read until nothing remained but fragments of\r\nleaves. Seven editions of this poem were printed between 1662 and\r\n1715 and few copies of any edition now exist. The book expressed\r\nthe quintesscence of Calvinism. Here is stanza 205, expressing the\r\nterror of those doomed to hell:\r\n\r\n    \"They wring their hands, their caitiff-hands,\r\n       and gnash their teeth for terrour:\r\n     They cry, they roar, for anguish sore\r\n       and gnaw their tongues for horrour.\r\n\r\n     But get away without delay,\r\n       Christ pities not your cry:\r\n     Depart to Hell, there may you yell,\r\n       and roar Eternally.\"\r\n\r\nPastor Higginson of Salem wrote enthusiastically of the natural\r\nabundance of the grass that \"groweth verie wildly with a great\r\nstalke\" as high as a man's face and as for Indian corn--the planting\r\nof thirteen gallons of seed had produced an increase of fifty-two\r\nhogsheads or three hundred and fifty bushels, London measure, to be\r\nsold or trusted to the Indians in exchange for beaver worth above\r\n£300. Who would not share the hardships and dangers of the frontier\r\ncolony for opportunity of such rich gain?\r\n\r\nBut the housewives in the far-away English homes were more\r\ninterested in the growth of the vegetable gardens in the virgin\r\nsoil, and of these he wrote: \"Our turnips, parsnips and carrots\r\nare here both bigger and sweeter than is ordinary to be found in\r\nEngland. Here are stores of pumpions, cucumbers, and other things\r\nof that nature I know not. Plentie of strawberries in their time,\r\nand pennyroyall, winter saverie, carvell and water-cresses, also\r\nleeks and onions are ordinary.\" Great lobsters abounded weighing\r\nfrom sixteen to twenty-five pounds and much store of bass, herring,\r\nsturgeon, haddock, eels, and oysters. In the forests were several\r\nkinds of deer; also partridges, turkeys, and great flocks of\r\npigeons, with wild geese, ducks, and other sea fowl in such\r\nabundance \"that a great part of the Planters have eaten nothing but\r\nroast-meate of divers Fowles which they have killed.\"\r\n\r\nThese were some of the attractive natural features of the new colony\r\nin the Massachusetts Bay, as recounted by the Salem minister. Of\r\nthe hardships he makes small mention, for his aim was to induce\r\nemigration. There was much sickness, however, and many deaths.\r\nHigginson himself lived only a year after reaching Salem. The\r\nbreaking up of virgin soil always brings on malaria and fever.\r\nDudley wrote \"that there is not an house where there is not one\r\ndead, and in some houses many. The naturall causes seem to bee in\r\nthe want of warm lodgings, and good dyet to which Englishmen are\r\nhabittuated, at home; and in the suddain increase of heate which\r\nthey endure that are landed here in somer ... those of Plymouth who\r\nlanded in winter dyed of the Scirvy, as did our poorer sort whose\r\nhowses and bedding kept them not sufficiently warm, nor their dyet\r\nsufficient in heart.\" Thomas Dudley wrote this in March, 1631. He\r\nexplained that he was writing upon his knee by the fireside in the\r\nliving-room, having as yet no table nor other room in which to write\r\nduring the sharp winter. In this room his family must resort \"though\r\nthey break good manners, and make mee many times forget what I would\r\nsay, and say what I would not.\"\r\n\r\nBut these hardships and inconveniences of living which the New\r\nEngland colonists met and overcame differ but little from those\r\nexperienced in every new settlement. They have been paralleled\r\nagain and again wherever Englishmen or Americans have wandered.\r\nIn a few years after the coming of the ships much of the\r\nrawness and discomfort must have disappeared, certainly in the\r\nearly settlements, and comparative comfort must have existed\r\nin most homes. If we could now lift the roof of the average\r\nseventeenth-century house in New England it is certain that we\r\nshould find disclosed not only comfortable conditions of living but\r\nin many instances a degree of luxury with fine furnishings that is\r\nappreciated by few at the present time.\r\n\r\nOf the early days following the settlement Roger Clap, who lived at\r\nDorchester, afterwards wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It was not accounted a strange thing in those days to drink water,\r\nand to eat Samp or Homine without Butter or Milk. Indeed it would\r\nhave been a strang thing to see a piece of Roast Beef, Mutton or\r\nVeal; though it was not long before there was Roast Goat. After the\r\nfirst Winter, we were very Healthy: though some of us had no great\r\nStore of Corn. The Indians did sometimes bring Corn, and Trade with\r\nus for Clothing and Knives; and once I had a Peck of Corn, or there\r\nabouts, for a little Puppy-Dog. Frostfish, Muscles and Clams were a\r\nRelief to Many.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Winthrop landed at Salem in June, 1630, he supped on\r\na good venison pasty and good beer, while most of those who came\r\nwith him went ashore on Cape Anne side (now Beverly) and gathered\r\nstrawberries. That was a fine beginning, but when winter set in many\r\nof them were \"forced to cut their bread thin for a long season\"\r\nand then it was that they fully realized that \"the Ditch betweene\r\nEngland and their now place of abode was so wide.... Those that were\r\nsent over servants, having itching desires for novelties, found a\r\nreddier way to make an end of their Master's provision, then they\r\ncould finde means to get more; They that came over their own men\r\nhad but little left to feed on, and most began to repent when their\r\nstrong Beere and full cups ran as small as water in a large Land....\r\nThey made shift [however] to rub out the Winter's cold by the\r\nFireside, having fuell enough growing at their very doores, turning\r\ndown many a drop from the Bottell, and burning Tobacco with all the\r\nease they could.\"[38]\r\n\r\n  [38] Edward Johnson, _Wonder Working Providence_, London, 1654.\r\n\r\nLacking bread they lived on fish, mussels and clams. The rivers\r\nsupplied bass, shad, alewives, frost fish and smelts in their\r\nseason, also salmon, and corn meal could be bartered for with the\r\nIndians and shortly raised from seed.\r\n\r\n\"Let no man make a jest at Pumpkins, for with this fruit the Lord\r\nwas pleased to feed his people to their good content, till Corne\r\nand Cattell were increased,\" wrote Johnson. Later (by 1650) the\r\ngoodwives served \"apples, pears and quince tarts instead of their\r\nformer Pumpkin Pies,\" and by that time wheat bread was no dainty.\r\n\r\nSociety in the Massachusetts Bay in the seventeenth century\r\nwas divided into several groups. First came the merchant class\r\nwhich also included the ministers and those possessed of wealth.\r\nEdward Randolph reported to the Lords of Trade in 1676, that in\r\nMassachusetts there were about thirty merchants worth from £10,000.\r\nto £20,000. \"Most have considerable estates and a very great\r\ntrade.\" Next came the freemen and the skilled mechanics. This class\r\nfurnished the town officials and constituted the backbone of the\r\ncolony. Then came the unskilled laborer and a step lower was the\r\nindentured servant. The merchant lived well and wore fine clothing\r\nforbidden to his more humble neighbors. The status of the servant\r\nmay well be shown by the deposition presented in Court at Salem\r\nin 1657 by an apprentice to a stone-mason in the town of Newbury,\r\nMassachusetts, who testified that it was a long while before \"he\r\ncould eate his master's food, viz. meate and milk, or drink beer,\r\nsaying that he did not know that it was good, because he was not\r\nused to eat such victualls, but to eate bread and water porridge and\r\nto drink water.\"[39]\r\n\r\n  [39] _Essex County Quarterly Court Records_, Vol. II, p. 28.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated frequently that in the olden times in New\r\nEngland every one was obliged to go to church. The size of the\r\nmeetinghouses, the isolated locations of many of the houses, the\r\nnecessary care of the numerous young children, and the interesting\r\nside-lights on the manners of the time which may be found in the\r\ncourt papers, all go to show that the statement must not be taken\r\nliterally. Absence from meeting, breaking the Sabbath, carrying a\r\nburden on the Lord's Day, condemning the church, condemning the\r\nministry, scandalous falling out on the Lord's Day, slandering the\r\nchurch, and other misdemeanors of a similar character were frequent.\r\n\r\nDrunkenness was very common in the old days. \"We observed it a\r\ncommon fault in our young people that they gave themselves to drink\r\nhot waters immoderately,\" wrote Edward Johnson. Every family kept\r\non hand a supply of liquor and wine, and cider was considered a\r\nnecessity of daily living in the country, where it was served with\r\neach meal and also carried into the fields by the workers. It was\r\nstored in barrels in the cellar and the task of drawing the cider\r\nand putting on the table usually fell to the younger members of the\r\nfamily. A man would often provide in his will for the comfort of\r\nhis loving wife by setting aside for occupancy during her life, one\r\nhalf of his house, with a carefully specified number of bushels of\r\nrye, potatoes, turnips and other vegetables; the use of a horse with\r\nwhich to ride to meeting or elsewhere; and lastly, the direction\r\nthat annually she be provided with a certain number of barrels of\r\ncider--sometimes as many as eight.\r\n\r\nRev. Edward Holyoke, the President of Harvard College, was in the\r\nhabit of laying in each year thirty or more barrels of cider as he\r\nhad to provide for much entertaining. Late in the winter he would\r\ndraw off part of his stock and into each barrel he would pour a\r\nbottle of spirit and a month later some of this blend would be\r\nbottled for use on special occasions.\r\n\r\nWhat was their conduct not only in their homes but in their\r\nrelations with their neighbors? Did they live peaceably and work\r\ntogether in building up the settlements? Did they set up in the\r\nwilderness domestic relations exactly like those they had abandoned\r\noverseas? It was a raw frontier country to which they came and it is\r\napparent that at the outset they felt themselves to be transplanted\r\nEnglishmen. So far as possible they lived the lives to which they\r\nhad been accustomed and they engrafted in their new homes the\r\nmanners and customs of the generations behind them. Most of them\r\nfully recognized, however, that they were not to return; that they\r\nhad cut loose from the old home ties and it was not long before\r\nthe necessities and limitations of frontier life brought about\r\nchanged conditions in every direction. Politically, religiously\r\nand socially, they were in a different relation than formerly in\r\nthe English parish life. Many of them, especially those somewhat\r\nremoved from the immediate supervision of magistrate and minister,\r\nbefore long seem to have shown a tendency to follow the natural\r\nbent of the frontiersman toward independent thought and action.\r\nTheir political leaders made laws restricting daily life and action\r\nand their religious leaders laid down rules for belief and conduct,\r\nthat soon were repellent to many. Civil and clerical records are\r\nfilled with instances showing an evasion of and even contempt for\r\nthe laws and rules laid down by the leaders of their own choosing.\r\nSome of it doubtless was in the blood of the men who had come in\r\nsearch of a certain individual freedom of action, but much of it may\r\nbe attributed to frontier conditions and primitive living. There\r\nwere many indentured servants, and rough fishermen and sailors have\r\nalways been unruly. Simple houses of but few rooms accommodating\r\nlarge families are not conducive to gentle speech or modesty of\r\nmanner nor to a strict morality. The craving for landholding and\r\nthe poorly defined and easily removed bounds naturally led to ill\r\nfeeling, assault, defamation, and slander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSPORTS AND GAMES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a subject on which there is little recorded information to\r\nbe found. Undoubtedly the background of English life, restrained\r\nby Calvinistic severity, was continued by the children and youth\r\namong the settlers. This must have been among the commonplaces of\r\ndaily life and of so little importance to the future that no one\r\nconsidered it worthy of recording. It is impossible to think of\r\nchild life without its natural outlet of sports and games--throw\r\nball, football, running, swimming, etc., and we know that dolls and\r\ntoys for children were for sale in the shops of Boston and Salem as\r\nearly as 1651.\r\n\r\nThe Indians indulged in similar sports and played \"hubbub,\" a game\r\nresembling dice, with much shouting of \"hub, hub, hub,\" accompanied\r\nby slapping of breasts and thighs.\r\n\r\nThe innocent games of childhood may be taken for granted and their\r\nEnglish origins may be studied in Strutt's _Sports and Pastimes of\r\nthe People of England_. It was gambling, and tavern amusements that\r\nthe magistrates endeavored to control.\r\n\r\nIn 1646 complaints having been made to the General Court of\r\ndisorders occasioned \"by the use of Games of Shuffle-board and\r\nBowling, in and about Houses of Common entertainment, whereby much\r\nprecious time is spent unprofitably, and much waste of Wine and Beer\r\noccasioned\"; the Court prohibited shuffle-board and bowling, \"or\r\nany other Play or Game, in or about any such House\" under penalty\r\nof twenty shillings for the Keeper of the house and five shillings\r\nfor every person who \"played at the said Game.\" As we now read this\r\nancient law the waste of precious time and the undue amount of wine\r\nand beer consumed would seem to be the principal occasion for the\r\nanxiety of the Court, for the game of bowls is excellent exercise\r\nand innocent enough; shuffle-board, however, may well be looked upon\r\nwith sour eyes. It required a highly polished board, or table,\r\nsometimes a floor thirty feet in length, marked with transverse\r\nlines, on which a coin or weight was driven by a blow with the hand.\r\nIt bore some resemblance to tenpins, the object being to score\r\npoints attained by sliding the coin to rest on or over a line at\r\nthe farther end of the board. The game induced wagers and thereby a\r\nwaste of substance and even in Old England was unlawful at various\r\ntimes, but difficult to suppress.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts magistrates also enacted a law at the 1640 session,\r\nprohibiting any play or game for money or anything of value and\r\nforbade dancing in taverns upon any occasion, under penalty of five\r\nshillings for each offence. The observance of Christmas or any like\r\nday, \"either by forbearing labor, feasting, or any other way\" was\r\nalso prohibited under penalty of five shillings for each person\r\nso offending. This action was occasioned by \"disorders arising in\r\nseveral places within this jurisdiction by reason of some still\r\nobserving such Festivals, as were superstitiously kept in other\r\nCountries, to the great dishonour of God and offence of others.\"\r\n\r\nStrange as it may now seem, the non-observance of Christmas existed\r\nin orthodox communities, especially in the country towns, until well\r\nup to the time of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates having learned that it was a \"custome too frequent\r\nin many places, to expend time in unlawful Games, as Cards, Dice,\r\n&c.\" at the same court decreed a fine of five shillings imposed on\r\nall so offending. Twenty-four years later the penalty was mightily\r\nincreased to five pounds, one half to go to the Treasurer of the\r\nColony and the other half to the informer. This was because of the\r\nincrease of \"the great sin of Gaming within this Jurisdiction, to\r\nthe great dishonour of God, the corrupting of youth, and expending\r\nof much precious time and estate.\"[40]\r\n\r\n  [40] _Laws and Liberties of the Massachusetts Colony_, Cambridge,\r\n  1672.\r\n\r\nAll this legislation seems to have been directed against indulgence\r\nin gaiety and human weakness in and about a public tavern. What\r\ntook place within the home was another matter although the orthodox\r\nPuritan continued to frown upon card playing and dancing until very\r\nrecently. But cards and gambling were common at all times among the\r\nmerchants and governing class as well as among the laborers and this\r\nwas especially true in the seaport towns where sailors congregated\r\nand where there was more or less contact with the Southern colonies\r\nand with foreign lands. In 1720 playing cards cost a shilling a\r\npack at James Lyndell's shop in Boston and a few years later David\r\nGardiner was advertising Bibles, Prayer Books, account books,\r\nplaying cards, and a great variety of other goods. Card tables\r\nappeared in inventories of estates, and were offered for sale by the\r\ncabinet makers.\r\n\r\nAt an early date horses became a prime article of trade with the\r\nWest Indies, where they were used in the sugar cane crushing mills,\r\nand wherever horses are bred, questions of speed must naturally\r\narise and therefore trials of speed and racing in the public eye.\r\n\r\nThis was a corrupting influence in the opinion of the\r\nMagistrates--\"that variety of Horse racing, for money, or moneys\r\nworth, thereby occasing much misspence of precious time, and the\r\ndrawing of many persons from the duty of their particular Callings,\r\nwith the hazard of their Limbs and Lives.\" It therefore became\r\nunlawful \"to practice in that Kind, within four miles of any Town,\r\nor in any Highway, the offenders, if caught, to pay twenty shillings\r\neach, the informer to receive one half.\"\r\n\r\nBut public opinion at a later date changed somewhat and here are a\r\nfew items gleaned from Boston newspapers that demonstrate the fact\r\nthat human nature two centuries ago was much the same as at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nHORSE RACE. This is to give Notice that at Cambridge on Wednesday\r\nthe 21st day of September next, will be Run for, a Twenty Pound\r\nPlate, by any Horse, Mare or Gelding not exceeding Fourteen and\r\na half hands high, carrying 11 Stone Weight, and any Person or\r\nPersons shall be welcome to Run his Horse &c. entering the same\r\nwith Mr. _Pattoun_ at the Green Dragon in Boston, any of the six\r\nDays preceding the Day of Running, & paying Twenty Shillings\r\nEntrance.--_Boston News-Letter_, Aug. 22-29, 1715.\r\n\r\nA horse race was advertised to take place at Rumley Marsh\r\n(Chelsea), on a £10 wager.--_Boston News-Letter_, Nov. 11-18, 1717.\r\n\r\nHORSE RACE.

On Thursday next the 2d of June, at 3 o'clock P.M., in\r\nStaniford's Street, near the Bowling Green, will be Baited a Bear,\r\nby John Coleson; where all Gentlemen and others that would divert\r\nthemselves may repair.--_Boston Gazette_, May 23-30, 1726.\r\n\r\nHORSE FAIR. This is to give Notice of a Horse Fair which is to be\r\nat Mr. John Brown's, Innholder at Hampton Falls, about seven miles\r\nto the Eastward of Newbury Ferry, upon the 20th and 21st days of\r\nApril next; at which time 'tis expected that there will be brought\r\nthither some Hundreds of Horses, to be sold or otherwise traded\r\nfor.--_Boston News-Letter_, Mar. 23-30, 1732.\r\n\r\nFor many years it was necessary for Massachusetts men to defend\r\ntheir families from marauding Indians and the French, and military\r\ntrainings were held at regular intervals. In May, 1639, a thousand\r\nmen took part at a training in Boston and in the fall of that year\r\nthere were twelve hundred. Such occasions provided opportunity for\r\nfeasting and drinking--perhaps we should say drunkenness--but as the\r\nyears went by the prayers and singing of psalms gave way to days\r\nof public enjoyment and not infrequently to boisterous license.\r\nGovernor Bradford wrote that the water of Plymouth was wholesome\r\nthough not, of course, as wholesome as good beer and wine. Even so!\r\n\r\nNew England Puritans hated Christmas, a day for Popish revelry. On\r\nChristmas Day in 1621, those who had recently arrived at Plymouth\r\nin the ship _Fortune_ entertained themselves with pitching the bar\r\nand playing stoolball, but at noon Governor Bradford appeared and\r\nordered them to stop \"gameing or revelling in the street.\"[41] On\r\nChristmas Day, 1685, Judge Sewall wrote in his Diary, \"Carts come\r\nto town and shops open as usual. Some somehow observe the day, but\r\nare vexed I believe that the Body of the People Prophane it, and\r\nblessed be God no authority yet to compel them to keep it.\"\r\n\r\n  [41] Bradford, _History of Plymouth Plantation_, Boston, 1853.\r\n\r\nCommencement Day at Harvard was also a day for diversion and vied in\r\nimportance in the public eye with election day and training days.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1700 billiard tables might be found in many of the\r\nlarger taverns and sometimes a ninepin alley.

There being many complaints made\r\nby divers of his Majesty's good subjects in the town of Boston, that\r\nin the night between the 5th and 6th days of November, from year to\r\nyear, for some years past, sundry persons with sticks, clubs and\r\nother weapons have assembled themselves together and disfigured\r\nthemselves by blacking their faces, dressing themselves in a very\r\nunusual manner, and otherwise disfiguring themselves as well as\r\ninsulting the Inhabitants in their houses, by demanding money of\r\nthem, and threatening them in Case of Refusal: which Doings being\r\nvery disorderly, and contrary to the good and wholesome laws, the\r\nJustices of the Peace in said town have concluded to take effectual\r\nmethods to prevent or punish such irregularities for the future,\r\nand would particularly caution and warn all Persons to forbear such\r\nProceedings hereafter.--_Boston Gazette_, Oct. 28, 1746.\r\n\r\nPOPE'S NIGHT CELEBRATION.

Any Person that has a mind to take a walk in the Garden at\r\nthe Bottom of the Common, to eat Currants, shall be Kindly Welcome\r\nfor Six Pence a piece.--_Boston News-Letter_, July 10-17, 1735.\r\n\r\nJacob Bailey, a country boy born in 1731 of humble parentage in\r\nRowley, Mass., was inspired by the local minister to obtain a\r\ncollege education, and after graduating at Harvard, he taught\r\nschool, eventually obtained a license to preach, and finally went\r\nto England where he took orders in the Anglican Church. Bailey had\r\na gift for versification and while teaching school in the country\r\ntown of Kingston, N.H., his muse led him to describe a corn husking,\r\na favorite frolic in country towns until very recent times, an\r\noccasion when the finding of an ear of red corn entitled the finder\r\nto kiss the girls. He begins:\r\n\r\n    \"The season was cheerful, the weather was bright,\r\n     When a number assembled to frolic all night.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Aunt Nabby's, \"where kisses and drams set the virgins on flame,\"\r\nhorseplay soon developed. Ears of corn were thrown, especially\r\nat loving couples, the girls were tumbled about on the husks and\r\npractical jokes found their victims. When supper was ready\r\n\r\n  \"Like crows round a carcass each one took his place\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"The girls in a huddle stand snickering by\r\n     Till Jenny and Kate have fingered the pie.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd after supper the \"scenes of vile lewdness\" abashed the country\r\nschoolmaster:\r\n\r\n    \"The chairs in wild order flew quite round the room:\r\n     Some threatened with fire brands, some branished a broom,\r\n     While others, resolved to increase the uproar,\r\n     Lay tussling the girls in wide heaps on the floor.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Quite sick of confusion, dear Dolly and I\r\n     Retired from the hubbub new pleasures to try.\"\r\n\r\nBailey's closing comment is illuminating; \"from many of these\r\nindecent frolics which I have seen in these parts, I must conclude\r\nthat rustics are not more innocent than citizens,\"[42] and we may\r\nrest assured that country manners and customs south of the Merrimack\r\nRiver were no different from those north of it.\r\n\r\n  [42] R. P. Baker, \"The Poetry of Jacob Bailey\" (_The New England\r\n  Quarterly_, Jan., 1929).\r\n\r\nIn country towns much of the population was thinly distributed and\r\nit was impossible for the housewife to run in next door for a few\r\nmoments' idle chat. Frequently the nearest house was a half-mile\r\nor more distant and the feminine desire for social diversion was\r\nsadly curbed by the constant demands of farm labor for horses that\r\notherwise might have been used in the chaise or wagon. The weekly\r\ngathering at the meetinghouse was always looked forward to with some\r\nanticipation by both old and young and the sacredness of the day\r\ndid not prevent discreet conversation on purely secular topics. But\r\nthe day when farmer Perkins raised the frame of his barn was made a\r\nsocial event in the full meaning of the word and when the \"raising\"\r\nof the meetinghouse took place, it certainly was a gala day, for in\r\ntown meeting it was voted to buy a barrel of rum and twelve barrels\r\nof cider, with sugar, beef, pork, and brown and white bread in\r\nproportion with which to refresh the gathering. Eighty-seven pounds\r\nof cheese were eaten and the town paid one shilling and six pence\r\nfor the mugs that were broken--let us hope purely by accident. But\r\n\"raisings\" occurred at infrequent intervals. Each fall, however,\r\nthere were corn huskings in various parts of the town and afterwards\r\nalways plenty to eat for the jolly workers. The women were invited\r\nto apple bees and sometimes there were spinning parties. Every\r\nwinter brought its singing school in the district schoolhouse and\r\nspelling matches sometimes brought together the fathers and mothers\r\nof the district as well as their sons and daughters. But the\r\nquilting party was always welcomed by the women with the keenest\r\nrelish. It was their personal affair. They were free for a time from\r\nthe noisy interruptions of the children and the men were not in the\r\nway although sometimes invited to a supper. As the quilted pattern\r\nadvanced over the surface \"the women gossiped of neighborhood\r\naffairs, the minister, the storekeeper's latest purchases, of their\r\ndairies, and webs and linens and wools, keeping time with busy\r\nfingers to the tales they told.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTRADES AND MANUFACTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the new settlements on the Massachusetts Bay, one of the prime\r\nnecessities was men skilled in the various trades, \"an ingenious\r\nCarpenter, a cunning Joyner, a handie Cooper, such a one as can make\r\nstrong ware for the use of the countrie, and a good brickmaker, a\r\nTyler, and a Smith, a Leather dresser, a Gardner, and a Taylor; one\r\nthat hath good skill in the trade of fishing, is of special use, and\r\nso is a good Fowler.\"[43] The Company had sent over men to govern\r\nand ministers to care for spiritual affairs and many of those who\r\ncame were skilled husbandmen.\r\n\r\n  [43] Wood, _New Englands Prospect_, London, 1634.\r\n\r\nMany of the smaller towns found themselves without men skilled\r\nin the mechanic trades and this was particularly the case with\r\nblacksmiths, a very essential trade in every community. This led to\r\ngrants by towns of land and buildings as inducement for smiths to\r\nsettle and work their trade. Carpenters were found everywhere, and\r\nbrickmakers naturally gravitated to deposits of clay while the other\r\ncraftsmen became distributed in accordance with the law of supply\r\nand demand, each taking on apprentices as had been customary in\r\ntheir old homes in England.\r\n\r\nThe principal productions available for commerce were fish, lumber,\r\nfurs and foodstuffs, but the building of shipping and the importance\r\nof the carrying trade must not be overlooked. In the way of domestic\r\nmanufactures the sawmill came first. The earliest were built on or\r\nnear the Piscataqua River, but wherever water power was available\r\nthey soon were set up replacing the laborious saw pits. As the\r\nwoodlands were cut off the sawmills moved farther up the stream\r\nor logs were brought to the mill-sites by floating down with the\r\ncurrent. The best of the tall trees were marked with the King's\r\nbroad arrow and reserved for masts for the royal navy and mast ships\r\nsailed for England from Portsmouth, N.H., at frequent intervals.\r\n\r\nThe shipbuilding industry required iron and shortly an iron works\r\nwas set up at Saugus, where bog iron from the neighboring swamps\r\nand meadows was smelted. The enterprise was financed in London\r\nand largely worked by Scotch prisoners sent over after the defeat\r\nat Dunbar, but the quality of the product proved unsatisfactory,\r\nsave in the way of casting pots and kettles, and before long the\r\nenterprise got into financial difficulties and was abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe high cost of imported iron forced the colonists to fashion wood\r\nto serve their needs not only for agricultural implements but for\r\nnearly all the utensils used in the household. Massachusetts staves\r\nand hoops were important articles of export to the sugar islands in\r\nthe West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe raising of flax and the manufacture of linen were attempted\r\nearly to supply domestic needs in country households. Families in\r\nseaport towns very generally bought their fabrics in the local shops\r\nwhich imported their stocks from London or Bristol.\r\n\r\nIn 1642 it was estimated there were a thousand sheep in\r\nMassachusetts and it was not long before the colony was sending wool\r\nto France and Spain in exchange for wines, fruits and other luxuries.\r\n\r\nThe history of early American manufactures has been told in Edward\r\nH. Knight's _American Mechanical Dictionary_, 3 volumes, Boston,\r\n1876, and William B. Weeden's _Economic and Social History of\r\nNew England_ (1620-1789), 2 volumes, Boston, 1894, makes easily\r\navailable an immense amount of research.

John Robinson, a wheelwright, was living in Ipswich as\r\nearly as 1635, only two years after the settlement of the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCONCERNING SHIPPING AND TRADE\r\n\r\n\r\nNew England, with its many rivers and indented coastline, until\r\nrecent years, has been a breeding place for sailors and a location\r\nfor shipbuilding. During the first century following the settlement,\r\nthe larger part of the population lived near the coast, and as roads\r\nbetween towns were poor, it naturally followed that craft of small\r\ntonnage were constantly employed for transport on the ocean and the\r\nnavigable rivers, and as no extent of rich soil was found awaiting\r\ncultivation, many settlers, of necessity, turned to fishing and to\r\ntrade. A ship carpenter was brought over to Plymouth, in 1624, who\r\n\"quickly builte them 2 very good and strong shalops ... and a great\r\nand strong lighter, and had ... timber for 2 catches\" framed when\r\nhe fell sick of a fever and soon died.[44] These shallops were used\r\nin opening a fur trade among the Indians on the Kennebec River that\r\neventually discharged the indebtedness of the Pilgrims to the London\r\nadventurers.\r\n\r\n  [44] William Bradford, _History of Plymouth Plantation_, Boston,\r\n  1912.\r\n\r\nSix shipwrights were sent over by the Company of the Massachusetts\r\nBay, in the spring of 1629, together with a considerable stock\r\nof ship stores, such as pitch, tar, cordage and sail cloth.[45]\r\nDoubtless these men were employed at the outset in housing the\r\nsettlers and in building small fishing boats, as the first vessel\r\nof any size in the Bay, of which there is record, is Governor\r\nWinthrop's trading bark, _The Blessing of the Bay_, of thirty tons,\r\nbuilt mainly of locust, which went to sea, August 31, 1631, on a\r\nvoyage to the eastward and afterwards traded with the Dutch at New\r\nAmsterdam.[46]\r\n\r\n  [45] _Transactions of the American Antiquarian Society_, Vol. III,\r\n  p. 90.\r\n\r\n  [46] _Winthrop's Journal_, New York, 1908.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1633, Emanuel Downing wrote to the Council for New\r\nEngland that he had made enquiries of Mr. Winthrop respecting\r\nthe ship carpenters employed in New England and found that the\r\nplantation was able to build ships of any burden. Their most\r\ncompetent shipwright was William Stephens, who had built in England,\r\nthe _Royal Merchant_, a ship of six hundred tons.\r\n\r\nThe General Court, in 1639, exempted ship carpenters and fishermen\r\n(during the fishing season) from compulsory military training.[47]\r\nTwo years later the Court was informed that some shipwrights were\r\nscanting their work and an order was adopted providing for a survey\r\nof all ship construction as was usual in England at that time.[48]\r\n\r\n  [47] _Massachusetts Bay Records_, Boston, 1853.\r\n\r\n  [48] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nThe coasting trade led to the building of small shallops and sloops\r\nand the need for firewood in Boston and Charlestown brought about\r\nthe building of sloops, broad of beam, intended especially for that\r\ntrade. Fishing craft and wood sloops were soon being built all\r\nalong the coast. As early as 1634, one merchant in Marblehead owned\r\neight fishing craft, and Portsmouth, N. H., had six great shallops,\r\nfive fishing boats, with sails and anchors, and thirteen skiffs, in\r\nthe trade as early as 1635. Richard Hollingsworth, in 1637, had a\r\nshipyard at Salem Neck and in 1641, built \"a prodigious ship of 300\r\nTons.\"\r\n\r\nThe number of New England vessels used in foreign trading during\r\nthe seventeenth century was considerable and the mainstay of the\r\ntrade was the fishing business. Off-shore fishing in the early\r\ndays was carried on in shallops--capacious, open boats carrying\r\nseveral pairs of oars and also fitted with masts and sails. They\r\nwere sometimes decked over, in whole or in part, and usually carried\r\none mast with a lug sail. Many of these small craft were built in\r\nthe winter time by the fishermen and their sons, as a fisherman is\r\nalways more or less of a boatbuilder by virtue of his calling. The\r\nlumber for the boat would be cut in the common woods and got out, a\r\nlittle at a time, and the boat when built would actually cost its\r\nowner little more than the outlay for certain necessary fittings.\r\nThese boats might be framed-in anywhere--on the beach in front\r\nof the fisherman's cottage; in his dooryard or in the woods, some\r\ndistance from the shore, to which the hull would be dragged by\r\noxen, on sledges of timber. The first vessels sent to \"the banks,\"\r\nfrom Massachusetts, for deep-water fishing, were \"a ship and other\r\nvessels,\" rig unknown.[49] That was in 1645.\r\n\r\n  [49] _Winthrop's Journal_, New York, 1908.\r\n\r\nBy 1665 there were three hundred New England vessels trading with\r\nBarbadoes, Virginia, Madeira, Acadia, etc., and 1,300 smaller\r\ncraft were fishing at Cape Sable. Cod and mackerel were caught and\r\nsalted. The best fish were sent to Malaga and the Canaries, the\r\nsecond sort to the Portugal Islands, and the worst to the Barbadoes\r\nthere to be used in the diet of the negro slaves. At that time,\r\nthe principal commodities produced in the Massachusetts Bay were\r\nfish and pipe-staves, masts, fir-boards, pitch, tar, pork, beef,\r\nand horses and corn which were sent to Virginia, Barbadoes, &c.\r\nTobacco and sugar were taken in payment and shipped to England.\r\nExcellent masts were shipped from the Piscataqua River, and many\r\npipe-staves. There were more than twenty sawmills located on that\r\nriver and \"much good timber was spoilt,\" reported an agent of Lord\r\nArlington, the Secretary of State.[50] New England masts, 33 to 35\r\ninches in diameter, at that time cost the Navy Commissioners from\r\n£95 to £115 per mast. The agent also reported that Boston, the chief\r\ntown, was \"built on a peninsula in the bottom of a bay, which is a\r\ngood harbour and full of fish. The houses are generally wooden, the\r\nstreets crooked, and neither days, months, seasons, churches, nor\r\ninns are known by their English names.\"\r\n\r\n  [50] _Calendar of State Papers, Am. and W. I._ (1661-1668), 347.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle years of the seventeenth century the waters of\r\nthe West Indies were covered with privateers commissioned to prey\r\nupon Spanish commerce. Not only did the home government issue\r\nthese commissions but every Colonial governor as well, and not\r\ninfrequently it was difficult to separate privateering from piracy.\r\nJohn Quelch, who was hanged in Boston for piracy, in 1704, preyed\r\nupon Portuguese commerce as he supposed in safety and not until he\r\nreturned to Marblehead did he learn of the treaty of peace that\r\nmade him a pirate. In 1653, Thomas Harding captured a rich prize\r\nsailing from Barbadoes and in consequence was tried in Boston for\r\npiracy, but saved his neck when he was able to prove that the vessel\r\nwas Dutch and not Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe town of Newport, R. I., frequently profited from the visits\r\nof known pirates, as in 1688, when Peterson, in a \"barkalonga\" of\r\nten guns and seventy men, refitted at Newport and no bill could be\r\nobtained against him from the grand jury, as they were neighbors and\r\nfriends of many of the men on board. Two Salem ketches also traded\r\nwith him and a master of one brought into \"Martin's Vineyard,\" a\r\nprize that Peterson, \"the pirate, had taken in the West Indies.\"[51]\r\nAndrew Belcher, a well-known Boston merchant, and master of the ship\r\n_Swan_, paid Peterson £57, in money and provisions, for hides and\r\nelephants' teeth, taken from his plunder.\r\n\r\n  [51] _Massachusetts Archives_, XXXV, folio 61.\r\n\r\nThe ill-defined connection between privateering and piracy was fully\r\nrecognized in those days and characterized publicly by the clergy.\r\nIn 1704 when Rev. Cotton Mather preached his \"Brief Discourse\r\noccasioned by a Tragical Spectacle in a Number of Miserables under\r\nSentence of Death for Piracy,\" he remarked that \"the Privateering\r\nStroke so easily degenerates into the Piratical; and the\r\nPrivateering Trade is usually carried on with an Unchristian Temper,\r\nand proves an Inlet unto so much Debauchery and Iniquity.\"\r\n\r\nAnother strong influence that led to insecurity on the high seas\r\nand eventually to outright piracy was the operation of the English\r\nNavigation Acts. European nations were in agreement that the\r\npossession of colonies meant the exclusive control of their trade\r\nand manufactures.\r\n\r\nIn 1696, Col. Charles Lidgett, a New England merchant, in \"Some\r\nConsiderations Offered to the Board of Trade,\" wrote that \"all\r\nthe American Colonies are generally esteemed according to the\r\nConveniency and benefit they bring to England, their Mother.\"[52]\r\nLord Chatham wrote, \"The British Colonists in North America have no\r\nright to manufacture so much as a nail for a horse shoe,\" and Lord\r\nSheffield went further and said, \"The only use of American Colonies,\r\nis the monopoly of their consumption, and the carriage of their\r\nproduce.\"[53]\r\n\r\n  [52] _Cal. State Papers, Am. and W. I._ (1696-1697), 84.\r\n\r\n  [53] Viscount Bury, _Exodus of the Western Nations_, London, 1865.\r\n\r\nEnglish merchants naturally wished to sell at high prices and to buy\r\ncolonial raw materials as low as possible and as they were unable to\r\nprovide a market for all that was produced, the Colonies were at a\r\ndisadvantage in both buying and selling. By the Acts of Navigation\r\ncertain \"enumerated articles\" could be marketed only in England.\r\nLumber, salt provisions, grain, rum and other non-enumerated\r\narticles might be sold within certain limits but must be transported\r\nin English or plantation-built vessels of which the owners and\r\nthree-fourths of the mariners were British subjects. Freight rates\r\nalso advanced, as other nations, notably the Dutch, had previously\r\nenjoyed a good share of the carrying trade.\r\n\r\nThe first Navigation Act was passed in 1645. It was renewed and its\r\nprovisions enlarged in 1651, 1660, 1663 and later. Before long it\r\nwas found that these attempts to monopolize the colonial markets\r\nresulted in a natural resistance and smuggling began and also an\r\nextensive trade with privateers and pirates who brought into all the\r\nsmaller ports of New England captured merchandise that was sold at\r\nprices below the usual market values. Matters went from bad to worse\r\nand servants of the Crown frequently combined with the colonists to\r\nevade the obnoxious laws. Even the Royal Governors connived at what\r\nwas going on. This was particularly true in the Colonies south of\r\nNew England.\r\n\r\nThere were pirates and pirates. Some were letters-of-marque and\r\nillegitimate traders and enjoyed the protection of merchants and\r\nofficials on shore, while others were outlaws. In 1690, Governor\r\nBradstreet of the Massachusetts Colony was complaining of the great\r\ndamage done to shipping by \"French Privateers and Pirates,\" and\r\nfour years later, Frontenac, the Governor of Canada, was asking for\r\na frigate to cruise about the St. Lawrence against the New England\r\n\"_corsaires and filibusters_.\" There is no doubt these French\r\nprivateers were a considerable menace to New England shipping and\r\nthat there was need for privately armed vessels to protect the\r\ncoast, a task not easy or desirable; so why should one scrutinize\r\ntoo closely semi-piratical captures made by so useful friends?\r\n\r\nThe profits of piracy and the irregular trade practiced at that time\r\nwere large, and twenty-nine hundred per cent profit in illicit trade\r\nwas not unusual, so there is little wonder that adventurous men took\r\nchances and honest letters-of-marque sometimes seized upon whatever\r\ncrossed their course. The pirate, the privateer and the armed\r\nmerchantman often blended the one into the other.[54]\r\n\r\n  [54] Dow and Edmonds, _Pirates of the New England Coast_, Salem,\r\n  1923.\r\n\r\nEdward Randolph landed in Boston on June 10, 1676, and during the\r\nnext week the following vessels arrived: \"a Bostoner, 100 tons,\r\nClutterbuck, master, from Nantes, laden with 50 butts of brandy and\r\nFrench commodities; a pink, of Boston, from France, of 70 tons,\r\nwith 12 tun of brandy, wine, etc.; a Scotsman, 130 tons, from the\r\nCanaries, with 80 pipes of Canary; a Bostoner, 80 tons, from the\r\nCanaries, with 50 pipes of Canary, and a ketch of Southampton, from\r\nCanary, with wine.\"[55] He reported to Secretary Coventry that the\r\nfishermen had made good voyages notwithstanding the war with the\r\nIndians. He estimated that the fish exported amounted to about\r\n£50,000 yearly with profitable returns in barter on masts and timber\r\nfor shipping sent to Barbadoes and other of the Carib Islands. The\r\nBay of Campeachy supplied about 1,000 tons of logwood annually.\r\nThe maritime towns were well stored with sailors, fishermen and\r\ncarpenters, and yearly several ships of good burthen were built,\r\nbesides ketches and barques. In 1676 thirty vessels had been ordered\r\nset on the stocks by merchants in England, but the Indian War had\r\nprevented building the full number. However, twelve were in process\r\nof construction at Boston, Charlestown, Salisbury and other places,\r\nsome of which were upwards of 160 tons burthen.\r\n\r\n  [55] _Cal. State Papers, Am. and W. I._ (1675-1676), 408.\r\n\r\nIn October he wrote that there were about thirty merchants in\r\nMassachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine estimated worth from £10,000\r\nto £20,000. Local commodities consisted of naval stores, cattle and\r\nprovisions, exported to Virginia, Maryland and the West Indies--(to\r\nthe latter were also sent \"houses ready framed\"), to Spain,\r\nPortugal, the Straits and England. Tobacco, sugar, indigo, cotton,\r\nwool, ginger, logwood, fustic, cocoa and rum were imported and again\r\nexported. \"They trade with most parts of Europe from which they\r\nimport direct all kinds of merchandise, so that little is left for\r\nEnglish merchants to import,\" wrote Randolph. \"Some ships have been\r\nsent to Guinea, Madagascar, etc., and some to Scanderoon; there are\r\nbuilt in the Colony, 730 ships varying from 6 to 250 tons, by thirty\r\nmaster shipbuilders.\" Duties were imposed on provisions and wines\r\nimported, and on ships, but there was no custom on exports, except\r\non horses.[56]\r\n\r\n  [56] _Cal. State Papers, Am. and W. I._ (1675-1676), 466.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1675, William Harris wrote from Boston that \"The merchants\r\nseem to be rich men, and their houses [are] as handsomely furnished\r\nas most in London. In exchange of fish, pipe-staves, wool and\r\ntobacco, they have from Spain, Portugal, and the islands, the\r\ncommodities of those islands; their wool they carry to France and\r\nbring thence linen; to England they bring beaver, moose, and deer\r\nskins, sugar and logwood, and carry hence cloth and ironwares; to\r\nBarbadoes, in exchange for horses, beef, pork, butter, cheese,\r\nflour, peas, biscuit, they have sugar and indigo; when they trade\r\nwith Jamaica; as they do sometimes, they bring home pieces of eight,\r\nplate, and pigs of silver.... As to cloth, there are made here\r\nLinsey woolseys, and other of cotton and wool, and some all sheep's\r\nwool, but the better sort of linen is brought from England; they\r\nhave many woolcombers, and some make tammeys, but for their private\r\nuse. Salt they get from Tortudas, not far from Barbadoes. It is sold\r\nat 10s. the hogshead, and is clear and white as alum, very sharp and\r\nmuch stronger than ordinary bay salt.\"[57]\r\n\r\n  [57] _Ibid._, 221-222.\r\n\r\nGovernor Simon Bradstreet wrote in 1680, in answer to an enquiry\r\nfrom the Lords of the Privy Council: \"There may bee near twenty\r\nEnglish merchants within our Government bred up to that calling, and\r\nneere as many others that do trade and merchandize more or less;\r\nbut Foreign merchants of other Nations Wee have none ... there are\r\ntwo or three [merchants] in our Corporation that may bee worth\r\nsixteen or eighteen thousand pound a piece, some few others worth\r\neight or ten Thousand pounds a piece, a third sort worth four or\r\nfive thousand pounds a piece.... Hee is accounted a rich man in the\r\nCountry that is worth one thousand or Fifteen hundred pounds. There\r\nare about one hundred or one hundred and twenty Ships, Sloopes,\r\nKatches and other Vessells that trade to and from hence yearly of\r\nour own or English built, most of them belonging to the Colony, wee\r\nhave eight or ten ships of one hundred tons or upwards, three or\r\nfour of two hundred tons or more, and about Forty or Fifty Fishing\r\nKatches of betwixt twenty and Forty tons; Six or eight English ships\r\ndo usually come hither yearly belonging to the Kingdom of England,\r\nbringing commodities of all sorts from thence.\r\n\r\n\"The obstructions wee [encounter] within our trade are the generall\r\ndecay of any profitable trade in the places wee mostly trade unto.\r\nVizt. to all his Majesties plantations in America, where wee send\r\nour horses, beasts, timber, provisions, mackeril, fish, etc. For the\r\ncommodities of those places which are spent here or transported into\r\nEngland wee finde those markets many times so overlaid and clogged\r\nwith the like comoditys from England, Ireland and other places,\r\nthat many of our commodities are sold at cheaper rates many times\r\nthen they were worth at home. 2dly The Algeir men of warr infesting\r\nthe seas in Europe have taken some of our Ships and men which is a\r\ndiscouragement to our trade and Navigation. 3dly the French at Nova\r\nScotia or Acadia (as they call it) do interrupt our Fishers in those\r\nparts and Sr. Edmond Andros, Governor of New-Yorke for his highness\r\nthe Duke of Yorke, doth the like betwixt the French and Pemaquid\r\nrequiring duty to bee paid to them by all our Vessells that fish in\r\nthose Seas, otherwise threatening to make prizes of them, which hath\r\nbeen alwaies Formerly free For his Majesties Subjects for Fishing\r\never since wee came hither.

Hist. Society_), Vol. VIII, pp. 336-339.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Colonists were all comfortably housed according to\r\nthe standards of the period and were producing all the foodstuffs\r\nneeded and more. Wines and spirit were imported in considerable\r\nquantity to give variety to the native beer and cider. Much butter\r\nand cheese were brought from abroad and also luxuries such as\r\nspices, chocolate, raisins of the sun, almonds, figs, oranges,\r\netc. Our English ancestors were gross eaters and drinkers. Mulled\r\nand spiced wines were drunk in the absence of tea and coffee, and\r\nhighly-seasoned dishes were popular. The absence of a variety of\r\nroot-crops made it necessary to pickle meat and pepper and spice\r\nwere used to a considerable extent. There was a very comfortable and\r\nvaried diet among the merchant and governing class but the farmers\r\nand common people lived much on salt pork, beans, fish and boiled\r\nfoods. As for clothing--home industry, of course, provided a certain\r\namount but as yet the loom was not in common use. Between 1665\r\nand 1675 over three hundred estates were settled in Essex County,\r\nMassachusetts, with only nine looms listed in the inventories.\r\nEighty-three of these homes, however, possessed spinning\r\nwheels--cotton, linen and wool--for every good wife and child could\r\nknit stockings, mittens and tippets. Among those who died during\r\nthis ten years were two tailors, five shoemakers, a cloth worker and\r\neight weavers.[59]\r\n\r\n  [59] _Probate Records Essex Co., Mass._, Salem, 1917.\r\n\r\nMuch clothing was brought from overseas, particularly for the town\r\ndwellers. John Hull, the mintmaster, records in his diary in June,\r\n1657, that three ships arrived from London bringing supplies of\r\nclothing, \"for, as yet,\" he writes, \"our chief supply, in respect\r\nof clothes, is from England.\" He owned a number of vessels and\r\nhis little ketches were constantly on the go between Boston and\r\nthe Barbadoes and thence to Bilboa, London or Bristol. He shipped\r\nsalted fish, logwood, tobacco, furs and plantation products and\r\nreceived iron in bars, salt, wines and fruits from Spain, while from\r\nEngland came dress goods, lead, shot, etc. His serges he wanted \"sad\r\ncoloured,\" none above 42 shillings, nor under 30 shillings. He also\r\ninstructed one of his captains to load \"dowlass and good nowell\r\nconvass [which was used for sails], Dutch duffalls, red penystones\r\nand flanils, no such scalet cloth as you brought me before.\" He\r\nlooked askance at calicoes. Another time he called for duffalls,\r\nwhite, striped or blue, with red and blue stockings, none above 16\r\nshillings and under if possible. He wanted no \"kersey\" that cost\r\nabove 46 pence per yard and the black stuff, either of \"hair or\r\nwosted,\" must be cheap.\r\n\r\nA cousin once advised him to ship a cargo of pipe-staves, hoops\r\nand fish to the Canaries, but he declined the venture and wrote in\r\nreply that he \"would more and more affect and imbrace opportunity of\r\ngetting out rather than running into the businesses of this world\r\nSpeacially forraigne trafficque as desirous to be more thoghtfull\r\nof Lanching into that vast ocian of Eternity whither we must all\r\nshortly bee carried yt soe I might bee in a prepared posture for my\r\nLord's Comeing.\"[60]\r\n\r\n  [60] Hull, _Letter Book_ (American Antiquarian Society).\r\n\r\nHis sea captains were carefully instructed \"to see to the worship of\r\nGod every day in the vessel and to the santification of the Lord's\r\nday and suppression of all prophaness that the Lord may delight to\r\nbe with you and his blessing be upon you which is the hearty prayer\r\nof youre frind and own^r.\" The sailors were not all to this way of\r\nthinking, however, but Mintmaster Hull rode with the ruling party\r\nwhich saw to it that the Quarterly Courts were kept busy measuring\r\nout the metes and bounds. In the journal of the voyage over kept by\r\nthe Reverend Higginson in 1629, he records a visitation of avenging\r\nProvidence; a just retribution inflicted upon the ungodly. He\r\nwrites, \"this day a notorious wicked fellow yt was given to swearing\r\nand boasting of his former wickednes and mocked at y^e daies of\r\nfast, railing & jesting ag^t puritans, this fellow fell sicke of ye\r\n[small] pocks and dyed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to discover at how early a date it was possible to\r\npurchase in the shops in New England, the manufactured products of\r\nOld England. It is known that George Corwin set up a shop in Salem,\r\nfor the sale of fabrics and hardware, as early as 1651, or only\r\ntwenty-five years after the first immigration. His shop was well\r\nstocked and at the outset he was selling such luxuries as children's\r\ntoys. Undoubtedly stocks of manufactured goods were on sale in the\r\nColony years before this time. In the matter of house hardware\r\nCorwin sold a considerable variety of locks. He carried stock locks\r\nof several sizes, spring locks with screws, single and double chest\r\nlocks, warded outside chest locks, outside box locks, plain cupboard\r\nlocks and small and large padlocks--by no means a poor assortment\r\nfor a small shop tucked into a corner in the American wilderness.\r\n\r\nThis shop, a few years later, was supplying the town with such\r\narticles as combs, white haft knives, barbers' scissors, flour\r\nboxes, carving tools, carpenter's tools of all kinds, door latches,\r\ncurry combs and brushes for horses, and a great variety of earthen\r\nand woodenware. Its shelves held broadcloth, red cloth rash,\r\nperpetuana, red cotton, sad colored rugs, green rugs, green Tammy,\r\nblue calico, crape, curley duroy, prunella, silk barronet, peniston,\r\nPersian silk, worsted faradeen, camblet, St. Peter's canvas, hall\r\ncloth, vittery, blue linen, noyles, together with a great variety\r\nof hose, stomachers, ribbons, tape, fileting, silk and gimp laces,\r\nneedles, pins, thread, buttons, etc., etc.[61]\r\n\r\n  [61] Corwin MSS. (Essex Institute, Salem, Mass.).\r\n\r\nThe invoice of an importation made into Boston in 1690, contains\r\nsuch items as brass curtain rings, dressing glasses, square\r\nmonument candlesticks, iron spring candlesticks, brass extinguishers\r\nand save-alls, tin lanterns, pocket nutmeg graters, bread graters,\r\nwooden rat traps with springs and a great variety of woodenware. It\r\nseems strange that New England should import from across seas wooden\r\nplates and bowls, yet here they are:\r\n\r\n  9 doz. best Maple Trenchers @ 30/ per dozen\r\n  1 doz. Porridge Dishes at 11/4.\r\n\r\nHere also are carved spoons, beer taps, hair sieves, sucking bottles\r\nand milk trays.[62]\r\n\r\n  [62] John Caxy v. Joseph Mallenson, _Mass. Archives_.\r\n\r\nFrom the returns of outward and inward entries at the Colonial\r\nports, the records of which are now preserved in the Public Record\r\nOffice in London, much may be learned concerning early shipping\r\nand trade in the Massachusetts Bay. Let us take, for example, the\r\nlast six months in the year 1714, covering the outward entries\r\nof shipping at the port of Boston. During that time there were\r\n236 clearances not including, of course, fishermen and coasting\r\ncraft. The rig is not stated in the first part of the register but\r\nbetween Sept. 21st and December 31st there were cleared 49 ships,\r\n18 brigantines, 64 sloops, two barques, one snow, one pink, and a\r\n\"ship or snow\" of 40 tons. Not a schooner is mentioned. The largest\r\nship measured 210 tons and the smallest was the _Grayhound_ of\r\nLondon, a British-built vessel of 33 tons, carrying a crew of five\r\nmen and a cargo of dyewood, turpentine, whale oil, barrel staves and\r\nsugar. With the exception of five ships hailing from London, every\r\nvessel cleared was \"plantation built,\" that is, it had been built\r\nin one of the American colonies. Of the 236 entries, 147 of the\r\nvessels hailed from Boston; 18 were owned in London; six in Bristol;\r\nfour came from the West Indies; and the rest hailed from New York,\r\nVirginia, Maryland, and other colonies. Most of them were small\r\ncraft averaging from thirty to sixty tons burthen.[63]\r\n\r\n  [63] Public Record Office, C.O. 5: 848-851 (copies at Essex\r\n  Institute).\r\n\r\nThe _Hopewell_, of North Carolina, five tons, and a crew of two men,\r\nwas loaded with rum and salt.\r\n\r\nThe _Swallow_, of Boston, 20 tons, and three men, sailed for\r\nAnnapolis Royal with a cargo of tobacco, pitch, molasses, rum, pork,\r\nand English goods for the garrison.\r\n\r\nThe sloop _Success_, owned in New York, 20 tons, with four men,\r\nsailed for home carrying four hhds. rum, pewter ware, a cart,\r\nchairs, boxes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe sloop _Pelican_ of Boston, 25 tons, with four men, sailed for\r\nVirginia, loaded with 42 bbls. salt, three hhds. rum, iron pots, etc.\r\n\r\nThe sloop _Sea Flower_ of Boston, 40 tons, with six men, entered\r\nout, the 3d day of November, carrying bread, butter, beer, onions,\r\nand peas for the logwood cutters in the Bay of Campeachy.\r\n\r\nThe brigantine _William and Susanna_, owned in Salem, 40 tons, and\r\neight men, sailed for Virginia, carrying rum, lime juice, salt,\r\nearthen ware, etc.\r\n\r\nThe sloop _Branch_ of Boston, 50 tons, with six men, sailed for\r\nSouth Carolina, carrying rum, blubber, onions, etc.\r\n\r\nThe brigantine _Speedwell_ of Boston, 60 tons, with seven men,\r\ncleared for Surinam, carrying 10 pipes of wine and twenty horses.\r\n\r\nThe ship _Brunswick_ of Boston, 65 tons, two guns and ten men,\r\nsailed for Barbadoes, carrying 37 hhds. fish, 50 boxes candles, and\r\n15 boxes of soap.\r\n\r\nThe ship _Mary Ann_ of London, 80 tons, with four guns and ten men,\r\nentered out, bound for Lisbon, carrying 240 quintals of salted fish,\r\n\"which is the whole cargo,\" states the register.\r\n\r\nThe ship _Bedmunster_ of Bristol, 100 tons, with ten men, returned\r\nhome with 18-1/2 tons of logwood, 507 bbls. tar, 307 bbls. pitch, 7\r\nbbls. whale oil, and 40-1/2 bbls. cranberries.\r\n\r\nThe ship _Amity_ of London, 130 tons, six guns and fourteen men,\r\nreturned with a cargo of 20 hhds. sugar, 5 bags of cotton, 168 tons,\r\n9 cwt. 1 qr. and 14 lbs. logwood, 10 bbls. pitch, pimento, wines,\r\nfurs and staves.\r\n\r\nThe largest ship to clear was the _Sophia_ of Boston, 310 tons,\r\nbuilt in New Hampshire, armed with 18 guns and carrying a crew of\r\ntwenty men. She sailed for Barbadoes carrying fish, corn, candles\r\nand lumber.\r\n\r\nAmong the more unusual articles of merchandise enumerated in the\r\ncargo lists are \"2 cases of returned pictures,\" shipped to London;\r\npots and frying pans, to Maryland; apples, cider, Indian meal, and\r\nsix sheep, shipped to Newfoundland; 230 barrels of cider shipped to\r\nPhiladelphia; and rum, cider, iron and brass, saddles and bridles,\r\netc. to North Carolina. Bricks, shingles, iron and woodenware, hops,\r\npickled sturgeon, beeswax, rice, furs, washed leather, linens and\r\ncalicoes are mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe West India trade called for lumber, horses, rum, food, and\r\nluxuries; and supplied sugar and molasses. Salt fish and pickled\r\nsturgeon were sent to Spain, Portugal and the Western Islands--Roman\r\nCatholic countries. The important dyewood trade in the Bay of\r\nCampeachy required foodstuffs; and the coasting trade with the\r\nSouthern colonies called for manufactured goods of all sorts and\r\nsupplied in return tobacco, pitch, turpentine and tar, which were\r\nused in the New England shipyards and also reshipped to England.\r\nThe fisheries in Newfoundland called for foodstuffs and London and\r\nBristol supplied markets for dyewoods, naval stores, furs, whale\r\noil, sugar, manufactured lumber, and wines brought from Portugal and\r\nthe Western Islands.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of April, May and June, in the year 1717, there\r\nwere twenty-seven inward entries at the Salem customhouse. All\r\nbut three were plantation built. Seventeen were owned in Salem;\r\ntwo hailed from London; two from Liverpool, and one from Bristol.\r\nThere were eight ships, four brigantines, twelve sloops and three\r\nschooners. The first of these schooners to enter was the schooner\r\n_Fisher_, 30 tons, Timothy Orne, master, registered at the Salem\r\ncustomhouse, Oct. 27, 1715. This is the earliest authentic record\r\nof a schooner I have ever found. Those vessels having the largest\r\ntonnage were the ship _Patience and Judith_, 100 tons, owned in\r\nLondon, England, and carrying six guns and a crew of fourteen men,\r\nentering from the Isle of May, with a cargo of 140 tons of salt;\r\nand, second, the ship _Friendship_, Capt. Samuel Crow, 100 tons,\r\nowned in Salem, carrying two guns and a crew of ten men, also\r\nentering from the Isle of May with 90 tons of salt. Ten out of the\r\ntwenty-seven entries brought in salt for the Salem fisheries.\r\nRum and lignumvitae wood came from the West Indies, and wheat,\r\ncorn, beans, flour, flax, hides, pork and lard came from Maryland,\r\nVirginia and North Carolina. The ships from English ports brought\r\nEuropean goods.\r\n\r\nDuring the last three months of 1754, eighty-seven vessels cleared\r\noutward at the Salem customhouse and sixty-eight were schooners.\r\nThe largest tonnage was the snow _Aurora_ of Salem, 130 tons, built\r\nat Newbury that year, sailing for Liverpool with a cargo of 15,000\r\nstaves and 40 tons of pine timber. Of the ten European clearances,\r\nseven were for Bilboa, with salted fish; thirty-three cleared for\r\nports in the West Indies; forty for southern colonies; and two for\r\nNewfoundland. The principal cargoes were salted fish, manufactured\r\nlumber, rum, sugar, molasses, salt, horses, sheep, and salted meats.\r\nNearly all clearing for Maryland, Virginia and the Carolinas carried\r\ncargoes of wooden, earthen and iron wares, probably manufactured in\r\nSalem or its immediate vicinity. Twenty-six thousand bricks were\r\nshipped to the West Indies and 20 bales of hay to South Carolina.\r\nThe two schooners clearing for Halifax were loaded with \"dead meat,\"\r\nprobably intended for the garrison.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three months of the year 1762, fifty-three vessels\r\ncleared from Salem, bound for foreign ports and the southern\r\ncolonies; thirty-four were schooners. The largest vessel was the\r\nship _Antelope_, 150 tons, a prize, registered at Salem in 1761 and\r\nowned by Richard Derby. She cleared for Guadaloupe with lumber,\r\nfish, train oil, and Fyall wines. There were nineteen clearances\r\nfor Guadaloupe during those three winter months. Listed with the\r\nstaples were the following curious items, viz.: 7-1/2 tons prize soap,\r\nillegally imported, shipped to Guadaloupe; and 12,000 feet of oars,\r\nshipped to St. Christophers. There is a surprising diversity of\r\nownership among these fifty-three vessels. No large shipowner had a\r\nconsiderable interest. Richard Derby of Salem owned three vessels;\r\nRobert Hooper of Marblehead, two; Jeremiah Lee of Marblehead, two;\r\nNathaniel Ellery of Gloucester, owned two and the rest were owned by\r\nmen who cleared only one vessel.\r\n\r\nThe ships, that plied between English and American ports, at more\r\nor less regular intervals during the eighteenth century, not only\r\nbrought an exchange of merchandise, but also carried passengers.\r\nOfficials connected with the government--the customs service and\r\nthe military establishment, with a sprinkling of clergymen and\r\nscholars, were crossing on nearly every ship and the New England\r\nmerchant sailing to London to buy a new stock of goods for his shop\r\nand the Englishman who came to the colonies bringing adventures of\r\ngoods in great variety, all helped to maintain the service. In the\r\nyear 1737, the Boston newspapers mention by name eighteen persons\r\nwho had arrived by ship or were about departing. On January 31st,\r\nJohn Banister, late in business with his uncle Samuel Banister, at\r\nMarblehead, advertised in the _Gazette_ that he designed speedily\r\nto embark for Great Britain and requested a settlement of all\r\naccounts. John Jeykill, the collector of the Port of Boston,\r\narrived from London, April 18th, in Captain Shepardson; early in\r\nMay, Thomas Phillips of Boston, merchant, advertised that he would\r\nsell his household furniture by vendue, as he intended speedily\r\nfor London, and a week later Major Martin and family arrived from\r\nAntequa, in the West Indies. He proposed to reside in Boston for a\r\nfew years. Toward the last of the month, the Lieutenant-Governor of\r\nNew Hampshire sailed from Portsmouth, bound for England, and about\r\nthe middle of June, the Rev. Doctor McSparrow and lady arrived in\r\nBoston. As late in the year as December 20th, Edmund Quincy, Esq.,\r\nthe agent of the Province at the Court of Great Britain, was sailing\r\nfor London, in Captain Homans, with several other unnamed gentlemen.\r\n\r\nVery little is known at the present time concerning the intimate\r\ndetails of life on board ship in the early times and especially as\r\nto the accommodations provided for passengers. On the vessels that\r\nbrought over emigrants in any number, the living conditions must\r\nhave been well-nigh intolerable because of crowding many people into\r\nlimited space and also by reason of a meagre equipment and lack of\r\nnecessary conveniences. During the period of the German emigration\r\nand that from northern Ireland in the mid-eighteenth century, there\r\nwas frequently a high mortality during the voyage and sometimes,\r\nwhen it was of unusual length, the supply of food and water ran\r\nshort and there was terrible suffering. Doubtless some attempt\r\nwas made to separate the sexes and the families but from time to\r\ntime cases are found in the court records in which depositions or\r\ntestimony clearly show that living conditions on board ship in the\r\nearly days were decidedly of a miscellaneous character.\r\n\r\nIt isn't necessary to delve into the very remote past in order to\r\ndiscover casual social relations between the sexes on board ship. In\r\n1888, I went the length of Cape Breton and while sailing up the Bras\r\nd'Or lakes on the steamer that plied regularly during the summer, I\r\ncame on deck early one morning to see the sun rise and then began an\r\nexploration of the boat. On the lower deck I suddenly came upon some\r\ntwenty or more barefooted and half-clothed men and women lying in a\r\nlong row, side by side, stretched out on mattresses placed on the\r\ndeck. They were probably waitresses, cooks, stewards, and the like,\r\nbut may have been second-class passengers. However that may be, they\r\nwere unconscious of the presence of any passer-by and slept quietly\r\ntogether like so many puppies.\r\n\r\nIn the olden time it is known that in the more regular passenger\r\nservice the main cabin was parted off at night by means of curtains.\r\nSmall cabins or staterooms were also built and especially on\r\nthe larger ships. It is impossible to imagine that it could be\r\notherwise, when the official station or wealth of the passenger is\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThe captain's cabin had its steward and there the food and service\r\nwere undoubtedly better than that provided forward where all slept\r\nin canvas hammocks slung from hooks in the deck timbers overhead,\r\nor lay upon pallet beds on the deck. Here they served themselves\r\nfrom the ship's galley. The foul odors below deck and the unsanitary\r\nconditions are part of the lore of the sea. \"Ship feaver\" was well\r\nknown to all physicians practicing in seaport towns. In those days\r\nthe cooking was done in an open fireplace. So, too, on shipboard\r\nthere was provided an open \"hearth\" made of cast iron and weighing\r\nfrom four to eight hundred pounds. This was fastened to the deck\r\nand its \"chimney\" was screened by a \"smoke sail.\" A smaller \"hearth\"\r\nwas in the captain's cabin and supplied all the heat below. It must\r\nhave been bitterly cold on board ship during a winter crossing.\r\nThe coals in these \"hearths\" were a menace to safety and required\r\nconstant attention.\r\n\r\nA communication printed in the _Boston News-Letter_ describes\r\nan escape from fire on board one of these English packets. The\r\nwriter, a good New England puritan, first declares his suspicion\r\nthat a certain military gentleman, a fellow passenger from Boston,\r\nhad brought on board a fair lady who was not his wife. The couple\r\noccupied a small cabin, partitioned off from the main cabin, which\r\nhad a curtained window looking into it. There were other curtains\r\nabout. As the Boston shopkeeper sat near the \"hearth,\" musing over\r\nhis suspicions, a sudden lurch of the vessel brought a carelessly\r\nplaced curtain swinging into the coals on the \"hearth\" and in an\r\ninstant it was aflame. The shopkeeper shouted \"Fire! Fire!\" which\r\nbrought the major's inamorata to her cabin window and an instant\r\nlater she rushed into the main cabin with a certain necessary\r\nreceptacle in her hands. One splash and the worst was over. The\r\ncharred curtain was soon torn from its fastenings and the fire\r\nstamped out on the cabin floor.\r\n\r\nIn 1760, Jacob Bailey, a native of Rowley, Mass., and a graduate\r\nof Harvard College, having prepared for the ministry and been\r\nlicensed to preach, determined to obtain orders in the Church of\r\nEngland and so, through the intervention of friends, took passage\r\nfrom Boston for London in the ship _Hind_, carrying twenty guns,\r\nwhich sailed in company with six other vessels. Mr. Bailey kept a\r\ndiary of the voyage and his description of the accommodations which\r\nthe ship supplied, the life on board, and the men with whom he was\r\nbrought in contact, is a surprisingly vivid picture of strange and\r\nuncouth conditions attending passenger service to England in the\r\nmid-eighteenth century. The ship lay at anchor in the harbor and Mr.\r\nBailey went out to her in a small boat.\r\n\r\n\"The wind was blowing strong, and it was some time before we could\r\nget on board ship. At length, with difficulty, I clambered up the\r\nside and found myself in the midst of a most horrid confusion. The\r\ndeck was crowded full of men, and the boatswain's shrill whistle,\r\nwith the swearing and hallooing of the petty officers, almost\r\nstunned my ears. I could find no retreat from this dismal hubbub,\r\nbut was obliged to continue jostling among the crowd above an hour\r\nbefore I could find anybody at leisure to direct me. At last, Mr.\r\nLetterman, the Captain's steward, an honest Prussian, perceiving\r\nmy disorder, introduced me through the steerage to the lieutenant.\r\nI found him sitting in the great cabin. He appeared to be a young\r\nman, scarce twenty years of age, and had in his countenance some\r\nindications of mildness. Upon my entrance he assumed a most\r\nimportant look and with a big voice demanded to know my request.\r\nI informed him that I was a passenger on board the _Hind_, by\r\npermission of Capt. Bond, and desired that he would be civil enough\r\nto direct me to the place of my destination. He replied in this\r\nlaconic style: 'Sir, I will take care to speak to one of my mates.'\r\nThis was all the notice, at present. But happily, on my return from\r\nthe cabin, I found my chest and bedding carefully stowed away in the\r\nsteerage. In the meantime the ship was unmoored and we fell gently\r\ndown to Nantasket....\r\n\r\n\"I observed a young gentleman walking at a distance, with a pensive\r\nair in his countenance. Coming near him, in a courteous manner\r\nhe invited me down between decks to a place he called his berth.\r\nI thanked him for his kindness and readily followed him down a\r\nladder into a dark and dismal region, where the fumes of pitch,\r\nbilge water, and other kinds of nastiness almost suffocated me\r\nin a minute. We had not proceeded far before we entered a small\r\napartment, hung round with damp and greasy canvas, which made, on\r\nevery hand, a most gloomy and frightful appearance. In the middle\r\nstood a table of pine, varnished over with nasty slime, furnished\r\nwith a bottle of rum and an old tin mug with a hundred and fifty\r\nbruises and several holes, through which the liquor poured in as\r\nmany streams. This was quickly filled with toddy and as speedily\r\nemptied by two or three companions who presently joined us in this\r\ndoleful retreat. Not all the scenes of horror about us could\r\nafford me much dismay till I received the news that this detestable\r\napartment was allotted by the captain to be the place of my\r\nhabitation during the voyage!\r\n\r\n\"Our company continually increased, when the most shocking oaths and\r\ncurses resounded from every corner, some loading their neighbors\r\nwith bitter execrations, while others uttered imprecations too awful\r\nto be recorded. The persons present were: first, the captain's\r\nclerk, the young fellow who gave me the invitation. I found him a\r\nperson of considerable reading and observation who had fled his\r\nnative country on account of a young lady to whom he was engaged.\r\nSecond, was one John Tuzz, a midshipman and one of my messmates, a\r\ngood-natured, honest fellow, apt to blunder in his conversation and\r\ngiven to extravagant profaneness. Third, one Butler, a minister's\r\nson, who lived near Worcester, in England. He was a descendant from\r\nButler, the author of _Hudibras_, and appeared to be a man of fine\r\nsense and considerable breeding, yet, upon occasion, was extremely\r\nprofane and immodest, yet nobody seemed a greater admirer of\r\ndelicacy in women than himself. My fourth companion was one Spear,\r\none of the mates, a most obliging ingenious young gentleman, who was\r\nmost tender of me in my cruel sickness. Fifth: one of our company\r\nthis evening was the carpenter of the ship who looked like a country\r\nfarmer, drank excessively, swore roundly, and talked extravagantly.\r\nSixth: was one Shephard, an Irish midshipman, the greatest champion\r\nof profaneness that ever fell under my notice. I scarce ever knew\r\nhim to open his mouth without roaring out a tumultuous volley of\r\nstormy oaths and imprecations. After we had passed away an hour\r\nor two together, Mr. Lisle, the lieutenant of marines, joined our\r\ncompany. He was about fifty years of age, of gigantic stature, and\r\nquickly distinguished himself by the quantities of liquor he poured\r\ndown his throat. He also was very profane.\r\n\r\n\"About nine o'clock the company began to think of supper, when a\r\nboy was called into the room. Nothing in human shape did I ever see\r\nbefore so loathsome and nasty. He had on his body a fragment only\r\nof a check shirt, his bosom was all naked and greasy, over his\r\nshoulders hung a bundle of woolen rags which reached in strings\r\nalmost down to his feet, and the whole composition was curiously\r\nadorned with little shining animals. The boy no sooner made his\r\nappearance than one of our society accosted him in this gentle\r\nlanguage. 'Go you ---- rascal, and see whether lobscouse is ready.'\r\nUpon this the fellow began to mutter and scratch his head, but\r\nafter two or three hearty curses, went for the galley and presently\r\nreturned with an elegant dish which he placed on the table. It was\r\na composition of beef and onions, bread and potatoes, minced and\r\nstewed together, then served up with its broth in a wooden tub, the\r\nhalf of a quarter cask. The table was furnished with two pewter\r\nplates, the half of one was melted away, and the other, full of\r\nholes, was more weather-beaten than the sides of the ship; one knife\r\nwith a bone handle, one fork with a broken tine, half a metal spoon\r\nand another, taken at Quebec, with part of the bowl cut off. When\r\nsupper was ended, the company continued their exercise of drinking,\r\nswearing and carousing, till half an hour after two, when some of\r\nthese obliging gentlemen made a motion for my taking some repose.\r\nAccordingly, a row of greasy canvas bags, hanging overhead by the\r\nbeams, were unlashed. Into one of them it was proposed that I should\r\nget, in order to sleep, but it was with the utmost difficulty I\r\nprevented myself from falling over on the other side....\r\n\r\n\"The next day, towards evening, several passengers came on board,\r\nviz: Mr. Barons, late Collector, Major Grant, Mr. Barons' footman,\r\nand Mrs. Cruthers, the purser's wife, a native of New England. After\r\nsome considerable dispute, I had my lodgings fixed in Mr. Pearson's\r\nberth, where Master Robant, Mr. Baron's man, and I, agreed to lie\r\ntogether in one large hammock.\"[64]\r\n\r\n  [64] Rev. W. A. Bartlett, _The Frontier Missionary_, Boston, 1853.\r\n\r\nSuch were the accommodations of the petty officers' mess on board a\r\ntwenty-gun ship of 1760 in the New England service.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1774, Miss Janet Schaw set sail from the Firth of Forth,\r\nScotland, in the brig _Jamaica Packet_, of eighty tons burden, built\r\nin Massachusetts two years before. With her sailed a girl friend,\r\ntwo young nephews, her brother and her maid. They arrived on board\r\nin the evening and turned in at once. In Miss Schaw's journal of the\r\nvoyage, now in the British Museum, we read:\r\n\r\n\"Our Bed chamber, which is dignified with the title of _state room_,\r\n[there were only two staterooms: the captain occupied the other] is\r\nabout five foot wide and six long; on one side is a bed fitted up\r\nfor Fanny and on the opposite side one for me. Poor Fanny's is so\r\nvery narrow, that she is forced to be tied on, or as the Sea term\r\nis _lashed in_, to prevent her falling over. On the floor below\r\nus lies our Abigail. As she has the breadth of both our Beds and\r\nexcellent Bedding, I think she has got a most envyable Berth, but\r\nthis is far from her opinion, and she has done nothing but grumble\r\nabout her accommodations.\" The two had been asleep about an hour\r\nwhen her brother came to the stateroom and let down \"the half door\"\r\nto enquire after their healths. His \"Cott\" swung from the ceiling\r\nof the cabin of the brig and the two boys slept on a mattress on\r\nthe deck beneath the hammock. The hencoop was located on deck just\r\nover his head and in the morning the rooster and hens kept up such a\r\npecking that it was impossible for him to sleep. The brig was making\r\na northerly course in a heavy sea and Fanny and the maid were both\r\nseasick and lying flat on their backs in their five by six foot\r\ncubicle, dimensions probably somewhat underestimated by Miss Schaw,\r\nalthough later she records that \"we sit in bed till we dress, and\r\nget into it whenever we begin to undress.\"\r\n\r\nIn the cabin, in which Schaw hung his \"cott,\" was a small cast-iron\r\nstove and here, too, was the case containing the Captain's gin,\r\nwhich he frequently opened and the odor of which set their stomachs\r\ntopsy-turvy and sent poor Fanny to her bed, and Schaw flying on deck\r\nfor fresh air. This cabin was furnished with joint stools, chests,\r\ntable, and even an elbow chair which Miss Schaw had lashed to a\r\nmooring near the fireside.\r\n\r\nA few days after sailing the brig ran into a storm and the water\r\nfinding its way into the cabin almost reached the beds in the\r\nstateroom--(which was located beside the companion stair)--forcing\r\nthe maid to \"peg in with the boys who could easily let her share\r\nwith them.\" The gale also washed away most of their private store\r\nof provisions so they were forced to depend upon the ship's stores\r\nwhich consisted mainly of neck-beef, several barrels of New England\r\npork, then on its third voyage across the Atlantic, oatmeal,\r\nstinking herrings and excellent potatoes. Lobscouse was a favorite\r\ndish made from salt beef that had been hung by a string over the\r\nside of the ship till tolerably fresh and then cut up in little\r\npieces and stewed for some time with potatoes, onions and peppers.\r\nThey also varied their diet by \"chowder, scratch-platter and\r\nstir-about.\"[65]\r\n\r\n  [65] _Journal of a Lady of Quality_, New Haven, 1921.\r\n\r\nJust forward of the cabin was the steerage filled with immigrants\r\nof all ages. Their beds were made up on the deck where they lay\r\nalongside of each other and in this low-studded space they existed\r\nwhen the hatches were battened down in stormy weather. \"They have\r\nonly for a grown person per week, one pound neck beef, or spoilt\r\npork, two pounds oat meal, with a small quantity of bisket, not only\r\nmouldy, but absolutely crumbled down with damp, wet and rottenness.\r\nThe half is only allowed a child, so that if they had not potatoes,\r\nit is impossible they could live out the voyage. They have no drink,\r\nbut a very small proportion of brakish bad water.\"\r\n\r\nIt is quite plain that eighteenth-century trans-Atlantic voyaging\r\nwas full of discomfort to the average traveler, and to the\r\nunfortunate in the steerage a fearful adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFROM WAMPUM TO PAPER MONEY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early settlers of New England had little coinage for circulation\r\nand were driven to the necessity of using the produce of the soil\r\nand the live stock from their pastures as their media of exchange.\r\nPeltry also was one of the first and for many years the principal\r\narticle of currency. It was offered in great abundance by the\r\nIndians who were very ready to barter it for beads, knives, hatchets\r\nand blankets and especially for powder, shot, guns and \"strong\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\nIn most of the Colonies the wampum of the Indians also was\r\nextensively used and frequently was paid into the treasury in\r\npayment of taxes. So, also, were cattle and corn as is shown\r\nby numerous enactments of the Great and General Court of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay. Musket balls were also current and were made\r\nlegal tender by order of the Court which decreed \"that musket\r\nbullets of a full bore shall pass current for a farthing a piece\r\nprovided that no man be compelled to take more than 12 pence at a\r\ntime of them.\" In Virginia, tobacco was used for currency and \"from\r\n100 to 150 pounds of it bought many a man a good wife.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian wampum was perhaps the most convenient currency\r\navailable. It is described by Roger Williams who, perhaps, had a\r\nbetter knowledge of it than most of the early colonists. He says:\r\n\"It is of two kinds which the Indians make of the stem or the stock\r\nof the periwinkle after all the shell is broken off. [The periwinkle\r\nis a mollusc, more common south of Cape Cod than along the shores\r\nof Massachusetts Bay.] Of this kind, six of the small beads, which\r\nthey make with holes to string upon their bracelet, are current\r\nwith the English for a penny. The other kind is black, inclined\r\nto a blue shade, which is made of the shell of a fish [that is, a\r\nmollusc] which some of the English call henspoquahoc [now known as\r\nthe hen-clam or quahaug] and of this description three are equal to\r\nan English penny. One fathom of this stringed money is worth five\r\nshillings.\"\r\n\r\nTo show the intimate relation of this Indian money to our early\r\nhistory, it appears that even Harvard College accepted it for\r\ntuition fees and otherwise; for in 1641 a trading company, chartered\r\nto deal with the Indians in furs and wampum, was required to relieve\r\nthe College of its super-abundance of this odd currency and redeem\r\nit, \"provided they were not obliged to take more than £25 of it\r\nat any one time.\" The thrifty Dutch at New Amsterdam, however,\r\ntook advantage of the scarcity of legitimate currency and the\r\ncorresponding demand for wampum and established factories where they\r\nmade it in such vast quantities that the market was broken and the\r\nvalue of wampum rapidly decreased.\r\n\r\nThe great source of metallic currency for New England in those\r\nearliest days was the West India Islands and much silver brought\r\nfrom there was later coined into \"pine tree\" shillings and\r\nsixpences. Governor Winthrop, in 1639, tells of a \"small bark from\r\nthe West Indies, one Capt. Jackson in her, with a commission from\r\nthe Westminister Company to take prizes from the Spanish. He brought\r\nmuch wealth in money, plate, indigo and sugar.\" But metallic money\r\nbecame so scarce that by 1640 there was but little in the colonies\r\nand the greatest difficulty existed in making payments for goods or\r\nthe wages of servants. In one instance, in Rowley, \"the master was\r\nforced to sell a pair of his oxen to pay his servant's wages and so\r\ntold the servant he could keep him no longer, not knowing how to pay\r\nhim the next year. The servant answered him that he would [continue\r\nto] serve him for more of his cattle. But how shall I do, said the\r\nmaster, when all my cattle are gone? The servant replied, why, then\r\nyou shall serve me and you shall then have your cattle again.\"\r\n\r\nVarious attempts were made to establish values to certain coins,\r\nmore or less ficticious, but this failed to relieve the situation\r\nand finally, to obtain a more stable basis the Massachusetts\r\nGeneral Court adopted a currency of its own and the \"pine tree\"\r\nmoney appeared, shortly preceded by the more rude and more easily\r\ncounterfeited New England shillings and sixpences, that bore on\r\none side the letters \"N. E.\" within a small circle and on the other\r\nside the denomination in Roman numerals. These primitive coins were\r\nmade between 1650 and 1652 and were superseded by the true oak and\r\npine tree pieces after that date. The simple irregular form of the\r\n\"N. E.\" coins rendered them an easy prey to the counterfeiter and\r\nthe clipper, and the design of the newer coins, covering the whole\r\nsurface of the planchet, was a protection against both dangers. The\r\n\"N. E.\" shilling is now a rare coin and likewise the sixpence, while\r\nthe threepence is rarer still, but two or three genuine examples\r\nbeing known to exist.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct forms of the so-called \"pine tree\" currency,\r\nthe one bearing on the obverse a representation of a tree resembling\r\nan oak, or as some say, a willow; the other with the true pine-tree.\r\nIt is thought that the ruder pieces bearing the oak tree design\r\nwere the first coined and that the more perfect pine tree money\r\nwas issued later. At any rate both \"oak\" and \"pine tree\" pieces,\r\nshillings, sixpences and threepences, all bear the same date, 1652.\r\nBut this money was issued continuously until 1686 without a change\r\nof the date, it is said, to avoid interference from the English\r\ngovernment, the coining of money by the colonists being a distinct\r\nviolation of the royal prerogative. By the retention of the original\r\ndate it was thought to deceive the authorities at home into the\r\nbelief that the violation of the laws ceased as it began, in 1652.\r\nIn 1652, however, a two-penny piece was minted bearing the oak tree\r\ndesign and hence it is natural to suppose that the pieces bearing\r\nthe true pine tree design were the last coined and not issued until\r\nafter 1662.\r\n\r\nOne of the traditions connected with the pine or oak tree money\r\nis the story that Sir Thomas Temple, who was a real friend of the\r\ncolonists, in 1662, showed some of the pieces to the King at the\r\ncouncil table in London, when King Charles demanded upon what\r\nauthority these colonists had coined money anyway and sought to have\r\norders sent to prohibit any further issues. \"But,\" responded Sir\r\nThomas, \"this tree is the oak which saved your majesty's life and\r\nwhich your loyal subjects would perpetuate.\" Sir Thomas of course\r\nreferred to the episode of Boscobel in which Charles II escaped\r\nhis enemies by hiding in the branches of an oak. This it is said\r\nso pleased the King that he dropped the subject and the coining of\r\n\"pine tree\" money proceeded merrily, as before, for twenty-five\r\nyears longer.\r\n\r\nThe master of the mint was John Hull who lived in Boston where\r\nPemberton Square now opens from Tremont Street and where later was\r\nthe famous garden and residence of Gardner Green, Esq. The mint\r\nhouse, sixteen feet square and ten feet high, was built on land\r\nbelonging to Hull in the rear of his house. Robert Sanderson, a\r\nfriend of Hull, was associated with him in making the \"pine tree\"\r\nmoney. It is not known how they divided their profit, but they\r\nreceived one shilling sixpence for each twenty shillings coined,\r\nand as it is estimated that \"pine tree\" money to the amount of five\r\nmillions of dollars in value was made during the thirty-four years\r\nit was issued, the commissions received must have been very large\r\nand the statement that the dowry, said to have been £30,000, given\r\nto Hull's daughter at her marriage, appears reasonable. That the\r\ngirl, plump as she is reported to have been, actually weighed down\r\nthe dowry in shillings, is, of course, absurd as that amount in\r\nsilver would weigh over 6,000 pounds rating a silver £ as weighing 4\r\noz. at that time.\r\n\r\nHawthorne's description of what is said to have taken place on that\r\noccasion is too vivid a picture to be overlooked. He relates that\r\nCaptain John Hull was appointed to manufacture the pine tree money\r\nand had about one shilling out of every twenty to pay him for the\r\ntrouble of making them. Hereupon all the old silver in the colony\r\nwas handed over to Captain John Hull. The battered silver cans and\r\ntankards, I suppose, and silver buckles and broken spoons, and\r\nsilver hilts of swords that figured at court--all such articles were\r\ndoubtless thrown into the melting pot together.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates soon began to suspect that the mint-master would\r\nhave the best of the bargain and they offered him a large sum of\r\nmoney if he would but give up that twentieth shilling which he was\r\ncontinually dropping into his own pocket. But Captain Hull declared\r\nhimself perfectly satisfied with the shilling. And well he might be,\r\nfor so diligently did he labor that in a few years, his pockets,\r\nhis money bags, and his strong box were overflowing with pine tree\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\nThen Samuel Sewall, afterwards the famous Judge Sewall of the days\r\nof witchcraft fame, came a courting to Hull's daughter. Betsy was\r\na fine and hearty damsel and having always fed heartily on pumpkin\r\npies, doughnuts, Indian puddings and other Puritan dainties, she was\r\nas round and plump as a pudding herself.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you may take her,\" said Captain Hull, to her lover, young\r\nSewall, \"and you'll find her a heavy burden enough.\" Hawthorne\r\ndescribes the wedding and the costumes of the contracting parties\r\nand their friends, and Captain Hull he \"supposes,\" rather improbably\r\none would think, however, \"dressed in a plum colored coat all the\r\nbuttons of which were made of pine tree shillings. The buttons of\r\nhis waistcoat were of sixpences and the knees of his small clothes\r\nwere buttoned with silver three-pences ... and as to Betsy herself,\r\nshe was blushing with all her might, and looked like a full-blown\r\npeony or a great red apple.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the marriage ceremony was over, at a whispered word from\r\nCaptain Hull, a large pair of scales was lugged into the room, such\r\nas wholesale merchants use for weighing bulky commodities, and\r\nquite a bulky commodity was now to be weighed in them. \"Daughter\r\nBetsy,\" said the mint-master, \"get into one side of these scales.\"\r\nMiss Betsy--or Mrs. Sewall as we must now call her--did as she was\r\nbid and again the servants tugged, this time bringing in a huge\r\niron-bound oaken chest which being opened proved to be full to the\r\nbrim with bright pine tree shillings fresh from the mint. At Captain\r\nHull's command the servants heaped double handfuls of shillings into\r\none side of the scales, while Betsy remained in the other. Jingle,\r\njingle, went the shillings as handful after handful was thrown\r\nin, till, plump and ponderous as she was, they fairly weighed the\r\nyoung lady from the floor. \"There, son Sewall,\" cried the honest\r\nmint-master, resuming his seat, \"take these shillings for my\r\ndaughter's portion. Use her kindly and thank Heaven for her. It's\r\nnot every wife that's worth her weight in silver.\"\r\n\r\nHowever interesting the story may be of the plump girl sitting in\r\none pan of the scales as shillings were thrown into the other, as\r\ndepicted in Hawthorne's version of the affair, we must be permitted\r\nto consider that time has cast a halo around the mint-master's\r\ndaughter and increased both her avoirdupois and her dowry.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was the only New England colony to coin silver but\r\nclose upon the date of the issue of the first \"pine tree\" money\r\ncame the Maryland shilling, sixpence, groat and penny, the last in\r\ncopper. These bear no date but appeared about 1659, the dies having\r\nbeen made in England.\r\n\r\nNumerous coins were later made in the colonies, either intended for\r\nregular circulation or as tokens privately issued, among which are\r\nthe Granby coppers--rude half-pennies--made in 1737 by one John\r\nHigley, the blacksmith, at Granby, Conn. They were made of soft\r\ncopper which was dug at Granby and are never found in very good\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe word dollar is the English form of the German word thaler, and\r\nthe origin of the thaler is as follows: In the year 1519, Count\r\nSchlick of Bohemia issued silver coins weighing one ounce each and\r\nworth 113 cents. They were coined at Joachimsthal, that is, James's\r\nValley or dale, hence they became known as \"Joachimsthalers,\" soon\r\nshortened to thalers. Through trade with the Dutch these coins came\r\ninto England in the sixteenth century and are referred to sometimes\r\nas \"dalers.\"\r\n\r\nBut the dollar came to the American continent not through the Dutch\r\nor English but through the Spanish. This was due to the extent of\r\nthe Spanish Empire in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and\r\nalso to the great quantities of silver which Spain drew from her\r\nmines in Mexico and South America. The Spanish coin was, strictly\r\nspeaking, a peso, better known as a piece of eight, because it was\r\nequal to eight reals (royals). As it was of the same value, the name\r\ndollar was given to the piece of eight about the year 1690.\r\n\r\nThe most famous Spanish dollar was known as the pillar dollar,\r\nbecause it had on one side two pillars, representing the pillars\r\nof Hercules, the classical name for the Straits of Gibralter, and\r\nthis Spanish dollar was common in America at the time of the War of\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\nIn 1690 the treasury of the colony was so nearly exhausted that the\r\nGreat and General Court decided to issue promises to pay, the first\r\npaper money minted by any Colony. The values were ten shillings, one\r\npound and five pounds. The occasion for this issue was primarily the\r\nexpenses of Governor Phips's expedition against Quebec, which was\r\nthriftily expected to more than pay costs. The French and Indians,\r\nhowever, were too strong for Sir William, and the colonial treasury\r\nwas faced with costs to the amount of £50,000, instead of the\r\nanticipated loot. These \"Colony\" or \"Charter bills\" obtained a wide\r\ncirculation and were called in annually and redeemed and reissued as\r\nneed arose, but after a few years, confidence in them decreased and\r\nbefore long they passed at a discount as great as 30 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn 1722, Massachusetts tried to relieve the scarcity of small change\r\nby issuing five hundred pounds worth of tokens of the value of one,\r\ntwo and three pence. They were printed on parchment to make them\r\nmore durable but apparently were not a success as there were no more\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, monetary conditions became more and more\r\nunstable, and in 1740 an attempt was made to establish a bank in\r\nthe hope of placing the currency on a firmer basis. The fight lay\r\nbetween a silver bank with bullion behind its notes and a land bank\r\nissuing notes guaranteed by mortgages and manufactured articles.\r\nThese notes were to come due in twenty years and at that time the\r\nholders instead of receiving coin might be forced to take their pay\r\nin cast iron, bayberry wax, leather, cordwood, or other articles\r\nof trade that might be difficult to dispose of. One of these notes\r\npreserved in the cabinets of the Massachusetts Historical Society\r\nhas written on its back, in old-time handwriting, \"A Land Bank bill\r\nreserved as a specimen of ye mad humour among many of ye people of\r\nye Province, 1740.\"\r\n\r\nMoney matters now went from bad to worse. The value of silver was\r\ncalled tenor. In 1740 silver was worth six shillings, eight pence\r\nper ounce and in 1746 seven shillings, sixpence, and the buying\r\nvalue of bills varied from year to year.\r\n\r\n\"Imagine having to keep in mind the relative values of bills of old\r\ntenor, with silver at 6/8, or middle tenor; or new tenor firsts at\r\n6/8, but passing current at 7/8; or new tenor seconds, all of which\r\nwere laboring under fluctuating but constantly increasing rates of\r\ndepreciation, while there were also to be remembered Connecticut\r\nbills of new tenor at 8/. and Rhode Island bills at 6/9 an ounce,\r\nand also £110,000 worth of private bills of the issue of 1733, which\r\nwere worth a third more than the Colony bills, and also £120,000 in\r\nnotes issued in 1740, \"on a silver basis,\" to stifle the land bank\r\nand equivalent to cash, and in addition \"public bills of the four\r\npromises at 29/. an ounce,\" whatever that means, and you will not\r\nwonder that there was confusion worse confounded.\"[66]\r\n\r\n  [66] Malcolm Storer, \"Pine Tree Shillings and other Colonial Money,\"\r\n  in _Old-Time New England_, October, 1929.\r\n\r\nIn 1749 Parliament voted to reimburse Massachusetts to the amount of\r\nnearly one million dollars, for expenses incurred in the expedition\r\nagainst Louisburg and this money was used to redeem outstanding\r\npaper bills at the rate of ten in paper to one in cash. The next\r\nyear old tenor ceased to be lawful money amid general rejoicing and\r\nmuch doggerel verse.\r\n\r\n    \"Now old tenor fare you well,\r\n     No man such tattered bills will tell,\r\n     Now dollars pass and are made free,\r\n     It is the year of jubilee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nHERB TEA AND THE DOCTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Massachusetts Bay Company held in London on\r\nMarch 5, 1628-29, it was proposed that the Company \"Intertayne a\r\nsurgeon for the plantation\" and one Abraham Pratt was sent over\r\nsoon after. He lived in Roxbury, Charlestown and Cambridge. While\r\nreturning to England with his wife in the fall of 1644, their ship\r\nwas wrecked on the coast of Spain and both were drowned. At the same\r\nmeeting the Company selected a barber-surgeon, Robert Morley, to\r\ngo to New England and practice his calling on \"aney of the Company\r\nthat are planters or there servants.\" In those days a barber-surgeon\r\nemployed himself in pulling teeth, bleeding and cupping.\r\n\r\nEarlier than this, however, Doctor Samuel Fuller had come over\r\nin the _Mayflower_ and was of the greatest service to the sickly\r\nfoundation at Plymouth. When John Endecott's wife lay dying at\r\nNaumkeak (Salem), in 1629, Doctor Fuller was hastily sent for, and\r\nthe next year he was called to Matapan (Dorchester) where he \"let\r\nsome twenty of these people blood: [and] had conference with them\r\ntill I was weary.\"[67] A month later he was at Charlestown writing\r\n\"I here but lose time and long to be at home, I can do them no good,\r\nfor I want drugs, and things fitting to work with.\" Three years\r\nlater he was dead of an infectious fever.\r\n\r\n  [67] _Bradford's Letter Book_ (1 Mass. Hist. Colls., Vol. III).\r\n\r\nA large portion of the physicians in the early days of the Colony\r\nwere Puritan ministers who had studied medicine in England in\r\nanticipation of removal to New England, as a hasty preparation for\r\nsuch necessities as might arise. Each practised in his own flock and\r\nCotton Mather in his _Magnalia_ (Book III, Chap. 26), speaks of this\r\nunion of the two professions as an \"Angelical Conjunction.\" When\r\nRev. Michael Wigglesworth died in 1705, his weeping parishioners in\r\nthe town of Malden, erected a stone to mark his grave and on it may\r\nstill be read the words\r\n\r\n    \"Here lies intered in silent grave below\r\n     Maulden's physician for soul and body two.\"\r\n\r\nIn colonial times there was little regulation of medical practice,\r\nalthough an ineffective law was passed in 1649. Any one might come\r\ninto a town and announce himself as a physician and if able to\r\ncure patients of their maladies, his success was assured. Several\r\nunfortunate failures, however, would seriously effect his standing.\r\nAs a natural result quacks appeared and disappeared in all the\r\nlarger towns.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, and later, there were two classes of\r\nmedical practitioners of which one prescribed vegetable substances\r\nonly, together with a free use of the lancet, and followed the\r\nteachings of Galen, the Greek physician. The other school followed\r\nthe doctrines of Paracelsus and prescribed for the most part mineral\r\npreparations, and oftentimes were styled \"chemists.\" Of course there\r\nwas bitter rivalry between the two schools, each maintaining so far\r\nas possible, a superstitious mystery concerning their profession.\r\nThere were few regular graduates from any recognized medical school.\r\nUntil after the Revolution most practitioners gained their scanty\r\nstore of medical knowledge by studying with some family physician\r\nand in the homely school of experience. Dr. William Douglas, a young\r\nScotchman, began to practice in Boston in 1716. In 1721 he wrote \"we\r\nabound with Practitioners, though no other graduate than myself.\r\nWe have fourteen Apothecary shops in Boston. All our Practitioners\r\ndispense their own medicines.... In general the physical practise in\r\nour colonies is so perniciously bad that excepting in surgery and\r\nin some very acute cases, it is better to let nature under a proper\r\nregimen take her course than to trust to the honesty and sagacity\r\nof the practitioner. Our American practitioners are so rash and\r\nofficious that the saying in Ecclesiasticus may with much propriety\r\nbe applied to them, 'He that sinneth before his Maker let him fall\r\ninto the hands of the physician.'\"[68]\r\n\r\n  [68] 4 Mass. Hist. Colls., II, 164.\r\n\r\nGovernor John Winthrop was versed in medicine and his son, John,\r\nJr., and his grandson Wait Winthrop, both were proficient in the\r\nprofession. With Winthrop came Richard Palgrave and William Gager,\r\nboth physicians, and two years later arrived Giles Firman, Jr.,\r\nwhose father was \"a godly man, an apothecary of Sudbury in England.\"\r\nGiles, Jr., studied at the University of Cambridge and later settled\r\nat Ipswich, Mass., where he practiced medicine, but found it \"a\r\nmeene helpe\" and later studied theology and eventually was ordained\r\nrector of Shalford, co. Essex, England.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the century there were two physicians practicing\r\nin Boston, Dr. Thomas Oakes and Dr. Benjamin Bullivant, of whom\r\nDunton, the London bookseller gossiped in his \"Letters Written from\r\nNew England.\"[69]\r\n\r\n  [69] _Prince Society Publications_, IV, Boston, 1867.\r\n\r\nOf Oakes he wrote that--\r\n\r\n\"His wise and safe Prescriptions have expell'd more Diseases\r\nand rescu'd Languishing Patients from the Jaws of Death, than\r\nMountebanks and Quack-Salvers have sent to those dark Regions.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning Dr. Bullivant he commented that--\r\n\r\n\"His Skill in Pharmacy was such, as rendered him the most compleat\r\nPharmacopean, not only in all Boston, but in all New England ... to\r\nthe Poor he always prescribes cheap, but wholesome Medicines, not\r\ncuring them of a Consumption in their Bodies, and sending it into\r\ntheir Purses; nor yet directing them to the East Indies to look for\r\nDrugs, when they may have far better out of their Gardens.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor John Clarke, said to have been a younger son of a good family\r\nin the north of England, with a collegiate education, and late of\r\nLondon, was granted a four-hundred acre farm in the town of Newbury,\r\nin January, 1638, and September 28th, following, the town also\r\ngranted that\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Clarke in respect of his calling should be freed and exempted\r\nfrom all public rates either for the country or the towne so long as\r\nhe shall remayne with us and exercise his calling among us.\"\r\n\r\nHe exercised his calling in Newbury until 1647, when he removed to\r\nIpswich and two or three years later settled in Boston where he died\r\nin 1664. Soon after removing to Boston he invented a stove \"for the\r\nsaving of firewood & warming of howses,\" which the Great and General\r\nCourt confirmed for a term of three years. Nothing further is known\r\nof this invention and the fireplace persisted until recent times.\r\n\r\nWhen Doctor Clark removed from Newbury he was followed by Dr.\r\nWilliam Snelling who seems to have been a merry fellow in times of\r\ndrinking healths. On an occasion during the winter of 1651 he drank\r\nto his friends in the following toast,--\r\n\r\n    \"I'll pledge my friends,\r\n     And for my foes,\r\n     A plague for their heels\r\n     And a pox for their toes,\"\r\n\r\nwhich e'er long led to sorrowful acknowledgment of his weakness\r\nbefore the Quarterly Court at Salem, and a fine of ten shillings for\r\ncursing. This doubtless helped sustain the dignity of the Court and\r\nstrengthened virtue among the good men of the town of Newbury at\r\ntimes when ribald mirth prevailed.\r\n\r\nDr. John Perkins who practised in Boston during the first half of\r\nthe eighteenth century, is said to have gone to London for two\r\nyear's study but his medical notebooks show that in his Boston\r\npractise he prescribed for scrofula, syrup made of sow bugs\r\ndrowned in white wine. Castile soap boiled in strong beer he used\r\nas a remedy for a \"heavy load at the Stomac.\" For numb palsy he\r\nprescribed \"a bath of absinthe in _urina hominis_, used hot,\"\r\nand his cure for a nervous weakness of the eyes was \"shaving the\r\nhead.\" He noted that \"Widow Alcock [died] of a hot bread supper.\r\nJus. Billings did so of eating Brown Bread for breakfast, a Thing\r\nhe never used before,\" and Reverend McGee's wife died by eating a\r\nsupper of roast chickens at 13 days after childbirth and drinking\r\nstrong beer flip on it. \"Wonderful that in learned and elevated\r\nsituations among ye great, should be such ignorance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Samuel Bent, Goldsmith, tender constitution and lax nerves, upon a\r\nchange of a linnen for a woolen cap to sleep in was affected with a\r\nrunning of Bloody Water from ye nose, which staunched when he wore\r\nlinnen.\r\n\r\n\"Nathaniel Parkman's Daughter, scrophulously affected, had a blow\r\non the Head, on which the scrophula immediately left her and Chorea\r\nSt. Viti succeeded and followed her every Spring till she turned\r\nconsumptive and died.\"[70]\r\n\r\n  [70] Sprague, \"Some Aspects of Medicine in Boston\" (_Old-Time New\r\n  England_, Vol. XIII, p. 14.)\r\n\r\nDoctor Perkins was quite modern in some of his theories. He entered\r\nin his notebook--\r\n\r\n\"Exercise is good [for pains in the stomach] in young girls and\r\nothers that use a sedentary life. So Sarah Bergers was cured by\r\nlearning country dances.\r\n\r\n\"Wheat, ye Shoemaker, was cured [of hemorrhoids] by taking to ye\r\nportering with a wheelbarrow.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Ball of Northboro had a medicine called, \"Receipt for the\r\nScratches. One Quart fishworms, washed clean; one pound hog's lard\r\nstewed together, filtered through a strainer and add one-half pint\r\noil of turpentine; one-half pint good brandy. Simmer it well and it\r\nis fit for use.\"[71]\r\n\r\n  [71] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nObstetrics at that period was also a jolly pastime, as the doctor\r\nand his volunteer assistants were regaled by a special brew known as\r\n\"groaning beer\" and by freshly baked \"groaning cakes.\"\r\n\r\nIn Salem lived Zerobabel Endecott, son of Governor John Endecott,\r\nwho practiced the healing art and who left behind him a remarkable\r\ncollection of medical recipes from which we include selections\r\nillustrating the practice of the physician in colonial days. His\r\nbrother John, afterwards Governor of Connecticut, also seems to have\r\nhad some medical training as appears from a bill preserved in the\r\nMassachusetts Archives, where under date of 1668, he charged five\r\nshillings for \"a Vomit and atendans\" on one John Clark, \"weak and\r\nsike by reason of a scurvy and a dropsy.\" Doctor Zerobabel died in\r\n1684 and bequeathed to his son John, who also was a physician and\r\nwho died in England, \"al my Instruments and books both of phisicke\r\nand chirurgery.\" The inventory of the estate shows \"a case of\r\nlances, 2 Rasors, a box of Instruments, 10 bookes in folio, 16 in\r\nquarto, a saw with six Instruments for a chirurgion and a chest of\r\nbookes & writings.\"\r\n\r\nOther Salem physicians were George Emery who settled in the town in\r\n1636 and sat on the gallows with a rope around his neck, in 1668,\r\nfor an unnatural crime; Rev. John Fiske, a graduate of Cambridge,\r\nwho had studied divinity and also physic, and came to Salem in\r\n1637; and Daniel Weld, who was chief surgeon during the Narraganset\r\ncampaign in King Philip's War; Col. Batholomew Gedney, who left at\r\nhis death drugs and instruments inventoried at £60; Dr. John Barton,\r\nwho died of yellow fever; Dr. John Swinnerton, made famous by\r\nHawthorne's romance, and others followed.\r\n\r\nWilliam Salmon, in his \"Compendium of Physick,\" published in\r\nLondon in 1671, estimates the necessary qualifications of the\r\nseventeenth-century physician as follows: \"He that would be an\r\naccomplished physician, ought to be furnished with three things,\r\n1. honesty and a good conscience; 2. a substantial, real, and\r\nwell-grounded understanding through the whole Art of Medicine; 3.\r\nwith all such Instruments and Necessaries which are ordinarily made\r\nuse of in the performance of any medical operation,\" and these\r\ninstruments are listed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The Parascuological Instruments, wherewith medicines are prepared,\r\nwhether Galenical or Chymical, are chiefly these: A brass Kettle;

The\r\ncharter provided that the Governor, Deputy Governor and Assistants\r\nmight hold courts \"for the better ordering of affairs,\" and so for\r\nthe first ten years, the Court of Assistants, as it was styled,\r\nexercised the entire judicial powers of the colony. Its members were\r\nknown as the magistrates. During this period but few laws or orders\r\nwere passed. When complaints were made, the court, upon a hearing,\r\ndetermined whether the conduct of the accused had been such as in\r\ntheir opinion to deserve punishment, and if it had been, then what\r\npunishment should be inflicted. This was done without any regard to\r\nEnglish precedents. There was no defined criminal code, and what\r\nconstituted a crime and what its punishment, was entirely within the\r\ndiscretion of the court. If in doubt as to what should be considered\r\nan offence, the Bible was looked to for guidance. The General Court\r\nitself, from time to time, when in doubt, propounded questions to\r\nthe ministers or elders, which they answered in writing, much as the\r\nAttorney General or the Supreme Judicial Court at the present day\r\nmay advise.\r\n\r\nBut the people soon became alarmed at the extent of personal\r\ndiscretion exercised by the magistrates and so, in 1635, the\r\nfreemen demanded a code of written laws and a committee composed\r\nof magistrates and ministers was appointed to draw up the same. It\r\ndoes not appear that much was accomplished although Winthrop records\r\nthat Mr. Cotton of the committee, reported \"a copy of Moses his\r\njudicials, compiled in an exact method, which was taken into further\r\nconsideration till the next general court.\" The \"judicials,\"\r\nhowever, never were adopted. In 1639 another committee was directed\r\nto peruse all the \"models\" which had been or should be presented,\r\n\"draw them up into one body,\" and send copies to the several towns.\r\nThis was done. In October, 1641, action was taken which led to a\r\ndefinite and acceptable result. Rev. Nathaniel Ward of Ipswich,\r\nwho had been educated for the law and had practiced in the courts\r\nof England, was requested to furnish a copy of the liberties, etc.\r\nand nineteen transcriptions were sent to the several towns in the\r\nColony. Two months later at the session of the General Court, this\r\nbody of laws was voted to stand in force.\r\n\r\nThis code, known as \"the Body of Liberties,\" comprised about one\r\nhundred laws, civil and criminal. The civil laws were far in\r\nadvance of the laws of England at that time, and in substance were\r\nincorporated in every subsequent codification of the laws of the\r\nColony. Some of them are in force today, and others form the basis\r\nof existing laws. The criminal laws were taken principally from the\r\nMosaic code and although many of them may seem harsh and cruel yet,\r\nas a whole, they were much milder than the criminal laws of England\r\nat that time. No reference was made to the common law of England.\r\nAll legislation in regard to offences was based upon the Bible, and\r\nmarginal references to book, chapter and verse were supplied to\r\nguide future action. This Code served its intended purpose well and\r\nremained in force until the arrival of the Province charter in 1692\r\nsave during the short period of the Andros administration.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary system of the Colony therefore provided for the\r\nfollowing courts:\r\n\r\nFirst, the Great and General Court which possessed legislative\r\npowers and limited appellate authority from the Court of Assistants.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Court of Assistants--a Supreme Court or Court of Appeals\r\nthat had exclusive jurisdiction in all criminal cases extending \"to\r\nlife, limb, or banishment,\" jurisdiction in civil cases in which the\r\ndamages amounted to more than £100., and appellate jurisdiction from\r\nthe County Quarterly Courts.\r\n\r\nThird, County or Inferior Quarterly Courts that had jurisdiction\r\nin all cases and matters not reserved to the Court of Assistants\r\nor conferred upon commissioners of small causes. These courts also\r\nlaid out highways, licensed ordinarys, saw that an able ministry was\r\nsupported, and had general control of probate matters, and in 1664\r\nwere authorized to admit freemen.\r\n\r\nThe juries were made judges of the law and the fact and when upon\r\na trial there was insufficient evidence to convict, juries were\r\nauthorized to find that there were strong grounds of suspicion, and\r\naccordingly sentence afterwards was given by the Court. In order to\r\nfacilitate court proceedings an excellent law was passed in 1656\r\nwhich authorized the fining of a person 20 shillings an hour for any\r\ntime occupied in his plea in excess of one hour.\r\n\r\nJohn Winthrop with his company arrived at Salem in June, 1630,\r\nand ten weeks later the first court in the Colony was held at\r\nCharlestown. The maintenance of the ministry was the first concern,\r\nto be followed by an order regulating the wages of carpenters,\r\nbricklayers, thatchers and other building trades. Thomas Morton\r\nat \"Merry Mount\" was not forgotten for he was to be sent for \"by\r\nprocesse,\" and a memorandum is entered to obtain for the next Court\r\nan estimate \"of the charges that the Governor hathe beene att in\r\nentertaineing several publique persons since his landing in Newe\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\nAt the second meeting of the Court of Assistants, three of the\r\nmagistrates were fined a noble apiece for being late at Court and\r\nthree weeks later Sir Richard Saltonstall, because of absence, was\r\nfined four bushels of malt. It was at this Court that Thomas Morton\r\nwas ordered \"sett into the bilbowes\" and afterwards sent prisoner\r\ninto England by the ship called the _Gifte_. His goods were ordered\r\nseized and his house burnt to the ground \"in the sight of the\r\nIndians for their satisfaction, for many wrongs he hath done them\r\nfrom time to time.\" Several towns were christened the names by which\r\nthey are still known, and those who had ventured to plant themselves\r\nat Aggawam, now Ipswich, were commanded \"forthwith to come away.\"\r\n\r\nAside from Morton's offences at Mount Wollaston, nothing of a\r\ncriminal nature seems to have been brought to the attention of the\r\nCourt until its third session on September 28th. To be sure the\r\nGovernor had been consulted by the magistrates of the Colony at\r\nPlymouth concerning the fate of one John Billington of Plymouth who\r\nhad murdered his companion John New-Comin. Billington was hanged,\r\nand \"so the land was purged from blood.\"\r\n\r\nUnless murder may have been committed at an earlier date by a member\r\nof some crew of unruly fishermen along the coast, this was the first\r\nmurder committed in the English settlements about the Massachusetts\r\nBay. But unfortunately it was not the last. Walter Bagnell's murder\r\nin 1632 was followed by that of John Hobbey and Mary Schooley in\r\n1637, and the next year Dorothy, the wife of John Talbie, was hanged\r\nfor the \"unnatural and untimely death of her daughter Difficult\r\nTalby.\" The daughter's christian name at once suggests unending\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1646 a case of infanticide was discovered in\r\nBoston. A daughter of Richard Martin had come up from Casco Bay to\r\nenter into service. She concealed her condition well and only when\r\naccused by a prying midwife was search made and the fact discovered.\r\nShe was brought before a jury and caused to touch the face of the\r\nmurdered infant, whereupon the blood came fresh into it. She then\r\nconfessed. Governor Winthrop relates that at her death, one morning\r\nin March, \"after she was turned off and had hung a space, she spake,\r\nand asked what they did mean to do. Then some stepped up, and turned\r\nthe knot of the rope backward, and then she soon died.\"\r\n\r\nThis curious \"ordeal of touch\" had also been applied the previous\r\nyear at Agamenticus on the Maine Coast when the wife of one Cornish,\r\nwhose bruised body had been found in the river, with her suspected\r\nparamour, was subjected to this supreme test. It is recorded that\r\nthe body bled freely when they approached which caused her to\r\nconfess not only murder but adultery, both of which crimes were\r\npunishable by death. She was hanged.\r\n\r\nProbably the last instance in Massachusetts when this \"ordeal of\r\ntouch\" was inflicted, occurred in a little old meetinghouse in the\r\nparish of West Boxford, in Essex County, one July day in the year\r\n1769. The previous December, Jonathan Ames had married Ruth, the\r\neldest daughter of the widow Ruth Perley. He took his bride to the\r\nhouse of his parents, some five miles distant, and lived there. As\r\nin some instances since that time, the mother-in-law soon proved to\r\nbe not in full sympathy with the young bride living under her roof.\r\nIn May a child was born and a few days after the young mother died\r\nunder circumstances which caused suspicion in the neighborhood. The\r\nbody was hastily buried, none of the neighbors were invited to be\r\npresent, and soon, about the parish, were flying rumors, which a\r\nmonth later crystalized into a direct accusation and a coroner's\r\ninquest. It was held in the meetinghouse that formerly stood in the\r\nsandy pasture near the old cemetery. The Salem newspaper records\r\nthat the building was \"much thronged by a promiscuous multitude of\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nThe court opened with prayer, the coroners then gave the jury\r\n\"their solemn charge\" and then the entire company proceeded, \"with\r\ndecency and good order,\" over the winding roadway up the hill to the\r\nburying ground, where for five weeks had lain the body of the young\r\nbride. During the exhumation the crowd surged around the grave so\r\neagerly that they were only held in check by the promise that all\r\nshould have an opportunity to inspect the remains. The autopsy at\r\nthe meetinghouse resulted in a report from the jury that Ruth Ames\r\n\"came to her death by Felony (that is to say by poison) given to her\r\nby a Person or Persons to us unknown which murder is against the\r\nPeace of our said Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity.\" When it was\r\nfound that no sufficient evidence could be adduced to hold either\r\nthe husband of the murdered girl, or his mother, then was demanded\r\nan exhibition of that almost forgotten \"ordeal of touch.\" The body\r\nwas laid upon a table with a sheet over it and Jonathan and his\r\nmother were invited to prove their innocence by this gruesome test.\r\nThe superstition required the suspected party to touch the neck of\r\nthe deceased with the index finger of the left hand. Blood would\r\nimmediately follow the touch of the guilty hand, the whiteness\r\nof the sheet of course making it plainly visible. Both mother and\r\nson refused to accept the ordeal. Whether or no they believed in\r\nthe superstition, we never shall learn. Fear may have held them\r\nmotionless before the accusing eyes. Certainly the nervous tension\r\nat such a time must have been very great.\r\n\r\nThe _Gazette_ states that the examination gave great occasion to\r\nconclude that they were concerned in the poisoning, and a week after\r\nthe inquest they were arrested and confined in the ancient jail in\r\nSalem where the persons accused of witchcraft were imprisoned many\r\nyears before. They were indicted and brought to trial. John Adams,\r\nafterwards President of the United States, then thirty-four years\r\nof age, was counsel for the accused. Jonathan Ames turned King's\r\nevidence against his mother. It was midnight before the counsel\r\nbegan their arguments and two of the three judges were explicit in\r\nsumming up the evidence, that there was \"a violent presumption\"\r\nof guilt, but at nine o'clock in the morning the jury came in and\r\nrendered a verdict of \"not guilty.\" May the result be attributed\r\nto John Adams's eloquence and logic or to the vagaries of our jury\r\nsystem?\r\n\r\nBut we are a long way from the third session of the Court of\r\nAssistants held September 28, 1630. Not until this time did the\r\nlaw begin to reach out for its victims. John Goulworth was ordered\r\nwhipped and afterwards set in the stocks for felony, not named. One\r\nother was whipped for a like offence and two Salem men, one of whom\r\nhas given us an honored line of descendants, were sentenced to sit\r\nin the stocks for four hours, for being accessory thereunto. Richard\r\nClough's stock of strong water was ordered seized upon, because of\r\nhis selling a great quantity thereof to servants, thereby causing\r\nmuch disorder. No person was to permit any Indian to use a gun\r\nunder a penalty of £10. Indian corn must not be sold or traded with\r\nIndians or sent away without the limits of the Patent. Thomas Gray\r\nwas enjoined to remove himself out of the Patent before the end of\r\nMarch, and the oath was administered to John Woodbury, the newly\r\nelected constable from Salem.\r\n\r\nAt the next session William Clark, who had been brought to book\r\nat a previous Court for overcharging Mr. Baker for cloth, now\r\nwas prohibited cohabitation and frequent keeping company with\r\nMrs. Freeman and accordingly was placed under bonds for a future\r\nappearance. Three years later this offender became one of the twelve\r\nwho went to Agawam and founded the present town of Ipswich, and ten\r\nyears later still another William Clark of Ipswich was sentenced to\r\nbe whipped \"for spying into the chamber of his master and mistress\r\nand reporting what he saw.\"\r\n\r\nNovember 30, 1630, Sir Richard Saltonstall was fined £5, for\r\nwhipping two persons without the presence of another assistant, as\r\nrequired by law; while Bartholomew Hill was whipped for stealing a\r\nloaf of bread, and John Baker suffered the same penalty for shooting\r\nat wild fowl on the Sabbath Day. And so continues the record of\r\nintermingled punishment and legislation.\r\n\r\nThe struggling communities that had planted themselves along the\r\nshores of the Massachusetts Bay largely had refused to conform to\r\nthe rules and ordinances of the English Church. If the records of\r\nthe Quarterly Courts are studied it will be seen that the settlers\r\nalso failed to obey the rules and laws laid down by the magistrates\r\nof their own choosing. To be sure there were large numbers of\r\nindentured servants and the rough fishermen along the coastline have\r\nalways been unruly. Much also may be attributed to the primitive\r\nand congested life in the new settlements. Simple houses of but few\r\nrooms and accommodating large families, surely are not conducive to\r\ngentle speech or modesty of manners nor to a strict morality. The\r\ncraving desire for land holding, and the poorly defined and easily\r\nremoved bounds naturally led to frequent actions for trespass,\r\nassault, defamation, slander and debt. The magistrates exercised\r\nunusual care in watching over the religious welfare of the people\r\nand in providing for the ministry. It has been stated frequently\r\nthat in the olden times everyone went to church. The size of the\r\nmeetinghouses, the isolated location of many of the houses, the\r\nnecessary care of the numerous young children, and the interesting\r\nside lights on the manners of the times which appear in the court\r\npapers, all go to prove that the statement must not be taken\r\nliterally. Absence from meeting, breaking the Sabbath, carrying a\r\nburden on the Lord's Day, condemning the church, condemning the\r\nministry, scandalous falling out on the Lord's Day, slandering the\r\nchurch, and other misdemeanors of a similar character were frequent.\r\nA number of years before the Quakers appeared in the Colony it\r\nwas no unusual matter for some one to disturb the congregation by\r\npublic speeches either in opposition to the minister or to some one\r\npresent. Zaccheus Gould, a very large landholder, in Topsfield, in\r\nthe time of the singing the psalm one Sabbath afternoon sat himself\r\ndown upon the end of the table about which the minister and the\r\nchief of the people sat, with his hat on his head and his back\r\ntoward all the rest of them that sat about the table and although\r\nspoken to altered not his posture; and the following Sabbath after\r\nthe congregation was dismissed he haranged the people and ended by\r\ncalling goodman Cummings a \"proud, probmatical, base, beggarly, pick\r\nthank fellow.\" Of course the matter was ventilated in the Salem\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nAt the February 29, 1648, session of the Salem Court eight cases\r\nwere tried. A Gloucester man was fined for cursing, saying, \"There\r\nare the brethren, the divil scald them.\" Four servants were fined\r\nfor breaking the Sabbath by hunting and killing a raccoon in the\r\ntime of the public exercise to the disturbance of the congregation.\r\nIf the animal had taken to the deep woods instead of staying near\r\nthe meetinghouse the servants might have had their fun without\r\npaying for it. A Marblehead man was fined for sailing his boat\r\nloaded with hay from Gloucester harbor, on the Lord's Day, when the\r\npeople were going to the morning exercise. Nicholas Pinion, who\r\nworked at the Saugus Iron works, was presented for absence from\r\nmeeting four Lord's Days together, spending his time drinking, and\r\nprofanely; and Nicholas Russell of the same locality was fined for\r\nspending a great part of one Lord's day with Pinion in drinking\r\nstrong water and cursing and swearing. He also had been spending\r\nmuch time with Pinion's wife, causing jealousy in the family; and\r\nthe lady in question, having broken her bond for good behavior, was\r\nordered to be severely whipped. The other cases were for swearing,\r\nin which the above named lady was included; for being disguised with\r\ndrink; and for living from his wife. And so the Court ended.\r\n\r\nA curious instance of Sabbath breaking occurred at Hampton in\r\n1646. Aquila Chase and his wife and David Wheeler were presented\r\nat Ipswich Court for gathering peas on the Sabbath. They were\r\nadmonished. The family tradition has it that Aquila returned from\r\nsea that morning and his wife, wishing to supply a delicacy for\r\ndinner, fell into grave error in thus pandering to his unsanctified\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nWhile we are discussing matters relating to the Sabbath and to\r\nthe church it may be well to allude to the ministry. It has been\r\nshown that the first concern of the Court of Assistants was a\r\nprovision for the housing and care of the ministry. Much the larger\r\nnumber were godly men actuated by a sincere desire to serve their\r\npeople and to preserve their souls. But many of them were men, not\r\nsaints, and so possessed of men's passions and weaknesses. While\r\nall exercised more or less influence over the communities in which\r\nthey lived, yet the tangible result must have been negative in some\r\ninstances. Take for example the small inland town of Topsfield,\r\nsettled about 1639. Rev. William Knight rendered mission service\r\nfor a short time early in the 40's and a dozen years later Rev.\r\nWilliam Perkins moved into town from Gloucester. He had been one\r\nof the twelve who settled the town of Ipswich in 1633; afterwards\r\nhe lived at Weymouth where he was selectman, representative to the\r\nGeneral Court, captain of the local military company and also a\r\nmember of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company. He also was\r\nschoolmaster in 1650 and the next year appears at Gloucester as\r\nminister, from which place he soon drifted into Court. Cross suits\r\nfor defamation and slander were soon followed by the presentment of\r\nMrs. Holgrave for unbecoming speeches against Mr. Perkins, saying\r\n\"if it were not for the law, shee would never come to the meeting,\r\nthe teacher was so dead ... affirming that the teacher was fitter\r\nto be a ladys chamberman, than to be in the pulpit.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins removed to Topsfield in 1656. The next year he tried\r\nto collect his salary by legal process and again in 1660. Three\r\nyears later a church was organized and their first minister was\r\nsettled. He was a Scotchman--Rev. Thomas Gilbert. Soon Mr. Perkins\r\nwas summoned to Salem Court where Edward Richards declared in court\r\nbefore Mr. Perkins' face, that the latter being asked whither he\r\nwas going, said, to hell, for aught he knew. Of course Mr. Perkins\r\ndenied the testimony. Later in the same year he was fined for\r\nexcessive drinking, it appearing that he stopped at the Malden\r\nordinary and called for sack. But goody Hill told him that he had\r\nhad too much already and Master Perkins replied, \"If you think I am\r\ndrunk let me see if I can not goe,\" and he went tottering about the\r\nkitchen and said the house was so full of pots and kettles that he\r\ncould hardly go.\r\n\r\nBut what of Mr. Gilbert. Three years after his settlement Mr.\r\nPerkins appeared in Court and presented a complaint in twenty-seven\r\nparticulars \"that in public prayers and sermons, at several times\r\nhe uttered speeches of a high nature reproachful and scandalous to\r\nthe King's majestie & his government.\" He was summoned into Court\r\nand bound over in £1000 to the next General Court where eventually\r\nhe was solemnly admonished publicly in open court by the Honored\r\nGovernor. With twenty-seven particulars, could a Scotchman restrain\r\nhis tongue? Mr. Gilbert could not, and shortly Mr. Perkins brought\r\ntwo complaints of defamation of character. Mr. Gilbert also soon\r\ndeveloped a love of wine for it appears by the court papers that one\r\nsacrament day, when the wine had been brought from the meetinghouse\r\nand poured into the golden cup, Mr. Gilbert drank most of it with\r\nthe usual result, for he sank down in his chair, forgot to give\r\nthanks, and sang a Psalm with lisping utterance. He was late at\r\nthe afternoon service, so that many went away before he came and\r\nThomas Baker testified \"I perceived that he was distempered in his\r\nhead, for he did repeat many things many times over; in his prayer\r\nhe lisped and when he had done to prayer, he went to singing &\r\nread the Psalm so that it could not be well understood and when he\r\nhad done singing he went to prayer again, and when he had done he\r\nwas going to sing again, but being desired to forbear used these\r\nexpressions: I bless God I find a great deal of comfort in it; and\r\ncoming out of the pulpit he said to the people I give you notice I\r\nwill preach among you no more.\" His faithful wife testified that\r\nhis conduct was due to a distemper that came upon him sometimes\r\nwhen fasting and in rainy weather. The following April he was again\r\nbefore the Court charged with many reproachful and reviling speeches\r\nfor which he was found guilty and sharply admonished and plainly\r\ntold \"that if he shall find himself unable to demean himself more\r\nsoberly and christianly, as became his office, they do think it\r\nmore convenient for him to surcease from the exercise of any public\r\nemployment.\" The stubborn Scot refused to submit and affixing a\r\ndefiant paper to the meetinghouse door he deserted his office for\r\nthree successive Sabbaths, when his exasperated people petitioned\r\nthe Court to be freed from such \"an intollerable burden\" and so the\r\nrelation ceased but not until further suits and counter suits had\r\nbeen tried for defamation, slander, and threatened assault.\r\n\r\nHis successor was Rev. Jeremiah Hobart, a Harvard graduate, who\r\npreached for a while at Beverly and found difficulty in collecting\r\nhis salary. He remained at Topsfield eight years and during that\r\ntime became a familiar figure at the County Courts, because of\r\nnon-payment of salary, for cursing and swearing, and for a damaging\r\nsuit for slander exhibiting much testimony discreditable to him.\r\nEven his brother ministers and the churches were not free from his\r\nreproachful and scandalous speeches so he at last was dismissed and\r\ntwo years later was followed by a godly man, Rev. Joseph Capen of\r\nDorchester, who enjoyed a peaceful pastorate of nearly forty years.\r\n\r\nThe severe penalties of the English legal code were much modified\r\nin the Bay Colony but public executions continued until the middle\r\nof the nineteenth century and were usually more or less a public\r\nholiday. The condemned was taken in a cart through the streets\r\nto the gallows. Not infrequently a sermon was preached by some\r\nminister on the Sunday previous to the execution and speeches from\r\nthe gallows always thrilled the crowd. The execution of pirates drew\r\nmany people from some distance. Several Rhode Island murderers were\r\nexecuted and afterwards hung in chains. The gibbeting of the bodies\r\nof executed persons does not seem to have been general.[91]\r\n\r\n  [91] Robert Hunt, a lime seller of Boston, differing with a man,\r\n  drew a sword and made two or three passes at him, upon which the man\r\n  seized the sword and broke it and went for a warrant to apprehend\r\n  Hunt who at once shut himself up in his house with a loaded gun and\r\n  two pistols beside him. When the officers appeared he fired out of\r\n  the window several times and wounded two boys but at last was taken\r\n  and committed to prison where three days later he committed suicide\r\n  by hanging \"with an old single Garter.\" The same afternoon his body\r\n  \"was carried thro' the Town in a Cart, and buried near the Gallows,\r\n  having a stake first drove thro' it.\"--_Boston Gazette_, Apr. 18,\r\n  1749.\r\n\r\nWhile executions by burning took place in Europe, and Salem is\r\nsometimes accused of having burned witches at the stake, there are\r\nbut two instances, so far as known, when this extreme penalty was\r\ninflicted in Massachusetts. The first occurred in 1681 when Maria,\r\nthe negro servant of Joshua Lamb of Roxbury willfully set fire to\r\nher master's house, and was sentenced by the Court to be burned\r\nalive. The same year Jack, a negro servant, while searching for\r\nfood set fire to the house of Lieut. William Clark of Northampton.\r\nHe was condemned to be hanged and then his body was burnt to ashes\r\nin the same fire with Maria, the negress. The second instance of\r\ninflicting the penalty of burning alive occurred at Cambridge in the\r\nfall of 1755, when Phillis, a negro slave of Capt. John Codman of\r\nCharlestown, was so executed. She poisoned her master to death by\r\nusing arsenic. A male slave Mark, who was an accomplice was hanged\r\nand the body afterwards suspended in chains beside the Charlestown\r\nhighway where it remained for nearly twenty years.[92] Why was\r\nthe woman deemed more culpable than the man in such instances of\r\npoisoning? The old English law so provided and at a later date,\r\nunder Henry VIII, poisoners were boiled alive in oil. The last\r\nexecution in Massachusetts for the crime of arson occurred on Salem\r\nNeck in 1821 when Stephen Merrill Clark, a Newburyport lad, fifteen\r\nyears of age, paid the penalty. He had set fire to a barn in the\r\nnight time endangering a dwelling house.\r\n\r\n  [92] Thursday last, in the Afternoon, _Mark_, a Negro Man, and\r\n  _Phillis_, a Negro Woman, both Servants of the late Capt. _John\r\n  Codman_, were executed at _Cambridge_, for poisoning their said\r\n  Master, as mentioned in this Paper some Weeks ago. The Fellow was\r\n  hanged, and the Woman burned at a Stake about Ten Yards distant from\r\n  the Gallows. They both confessed themselves guilty of the Crime for\r\n  which they suffered, acknowledged the Justice of their Sentence, and\r\n  died very penitent. After Execution, the Body of _Mark_ was brought\r\n  down to _Charlestown_ Common, and hanged in Chains, on a Gibbet\r\n  erected there for that Purpose.--_Boston Evening-Post_, Sept. 22,\r\n  1755.\r\n\r\nTen years before the adoption of the \"Body of Liberties,\" adultery\r\nbecame a capital crime in accordance with the Mosaic law. The\r\nfirst case was one John Dawe, for enticing an Indian woman. He was\r\nseverely whipped, and at the next session of the General Court,\r\nthe death penalty was ordered for the future. When we consider the\r\nfreedom of manners of the time, the clothing worn by the women, the\r\nlimited sleeping accommodations and the ignorance of the servants,\r\nit is remarkable that the penalty was inflicted in so few cases.\r\nThe records are full of cases of fornication, uncleanness, wanton\r\ndalliance, unseemly behaviour, unchaste words, and living away from\r\nwife, and the more so during the earlier years. Possibly, the juries\r\nmay have thought the penalty too severe and found the parties guilty\r\nonly, of \"adulterous behavior,\" which happened in Boston in 1645.\r\nThis followed a case of the previous year where a young woman had\r\nmarried an old man out of pique and then received the attentions of\r\na young man of eighteen. They both were hanged.\r\n\r\nThe Court Records of the County of Essex always must have a curious\r\ninterest because of the witchcraft cases. But the first execution\r\nin Massachusetts for witchcraft did not take place in Salem, but\r\nin Boston, in 1648, when Margaret Jones of Charlestown was hanged.\r\nIt was shown that she had a malignant touch, that she produced\r\ndeafness, practiced physic, and that her harmless medicines produced\r\nviolent effects. She foretold things which came to pass and lied at\r\nher trial and railed at the jury. The midwives found that mysterious\r\nexcrescence upon her, and for all these crimes she was hanged, and\r\nas a proof from Heaven of the justice of her taking off there was a\r\ngreat tempest in Connecticut on the very hour she was executed.\r\n\r\nBut Essex County court records show several witchcraft cases during\r\nthe first twenty-five years following the settlement. In September,\r\n1650, Henry Pease of Marblehead, deposed that he heard Peter Pitford\r\nof Marblehead say that goodwife James was a witch and that he saw\r\nher in a boat at sea in the likeness of a cat, and that his garden\r\nfruits did not prosper so long as he lived near that woman, and\r\nthat said Pitford often called her \"Jesable.\" Erasmus James, her\r\nhusband, promptly brought suit for slander, and at the next Court\r\nanother suit for defamation by which he received 50s. damages. The\r\ncourt records show that this Jane James had previously made her\r\nappearance, for in June, 1639, Mr. Anthony Thatcher complained that\r\nshe took things from his house. She and her husband were bound for\r\nher good behavior and \"the boys to be whipped by the Governor of\r\nthe Family where they had offended.\" Six years later, in September,\r\n1645, John Bartoll said in open court that he could \"prove Jane\r\nJames a common lyer, a theif & a false forsworn woman,\" and a\r\nyear later, in September, 1646, Thomas Bowen, and his wife, Mary,\r\ntestified that Jane James spoke to William Barber in Bowen's house\r\nin Marblehead and Barber said, \"get you out of doors you filthy old\r\nBaud or else I will cuttle your hide, you old filthy baggage,\" & he\r\ntook up a firebrand but did not throw it at her. Peter Pitford's\r\naccusation was not the only one for in the following year John\r\nGatchell said that Erasmus James's wife was an old witch and that he\r\nhad seen her going in a boat on the water toward Boston, when she\r\nwas in her yard at home. But Erasmus promptly brought suit in the\r\nSalem court and recovered a verdict in his favor.\r\n\r\nThere are several other cases before 1655. In October, 1650, Thomas\r\nCrauly of Hampton sued Ralph Hall for slander, for saying he had\r\ncalled Robert Sawyer's wife a witch.\r\n\r\nJohn Bradstreet, a young man of Rowley, was presented at Court in\r\n1652 for having familiarity with the devil, witnesses testifying\r\nthat Bradstreet said that he read in a book of magic and that\r\nhe heard a voice asking him what work he had for him to do, and\r\nBradstreet answered \"go make a bridge of sand over the sea, go\r\nmake a ladder of sand up to Heaven and go to God and come down no\r\nmore.\" There was much palaver but the Court showed common sense and\r\nBradstreet was ordered to be fined or whipped for telling a lie.\r\n\r\nIn 1653 Christopher Collins of Lynn brought suit against Enoch\r\nColdan for slander, for saying that Collins' wife was a witch and\r\ncalling her a witch. The judgment however was for the defendant.\r\nAnother accusation was promptly squelched in the fall of the same\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nEdmond Marshall of Gloucester unwisely stated publicly that Mistress\r\nPerkins, Goodey Evans, Goodey Dutch and Goodey Vincent were under\r\nsuspicion of being witches. Their husbands at once brought suit for\r\ndefamation of character and the verdict in each case was, that the\r\ndefendant should make public acknowledgment within fourteen days in\r\nthe meetinghouses at Salem, Ipswich and Gloucester.\r\n\r\nTo sentence a culprit to expiate his crime before the congregation\r\nin the meetinghouse was a common thing. The publicity, in theory,\r\ninduced shame and thus served as a future deterrent. To sit in the\r\nstocks and then make public acknowledgment before the congregation\r\nwas a favorite penalty. Sometimes the offender was ordered to stand\r\nat the church door with a paper on his hat inscribed with the crime\r\nhe had committed. If for lying, a cleft stick might ornament his\r\ntongue. Whipping was the most frequent penalty, closely followed by\r\nthe stocks, and after a time imprisonment became more common. The\r\nbilboes were used only in the earliest period. The use of the stocks\r\nand whipping post was discontinued in 1813 and not a single example\r\nseems to have survived in either museum or attic. The pillory was in\r\nuse in State Street, Boston, as late as 1803, and two years before,\r\nJohn Hawkins stood one hour in the pillory in what is now Washington\r\nStreet, Salem, and afterwards had one ear cropped--all for the\r\ncrime of forgery. Branding the hand or cheek was also inflicted,\r\nand Hawthorne has made famous another form of branding, the wearing\r\nprominently upon the clothing, an initial letter of a contrary\r\ncolor, symbolizing the crime committed. This penalty was inflicted\r\nupon a man at Springfield, as late as October 7, 1754, and the law\r\nremained in force until February 17, 1785. As early as 1634 a Boston\r\ndrunkard was sentenced to wear a red D about his neck for a year.[93]\r\n\r\n  [93] At the Court of Assize, at Springfield, the 2d Tuesday of\r\n  September last, Daniel Bailey and Mary Rainer, of a Place adjoining\r\n  to Sheffield in that county, were convicted of Adultery, and were\r\n  sentenced to suffer the Penalty of the Law therefor, viz. to sit\r\n  on the Gallows with a Rope about their Necks, for the Space of an\r\n  Hour; to be whipt forty Stripes each, and to wear for ever after\r\n  a Capital A, two Inches long, and proportionable in bigness, cut\r\n  out in Cloth of a contrary Colour to their Cloaths, and sewed upon\r\n  their upper Garments, either upon the outside of the arm, or on the\r\n  back.--_Boston Evening-Post_, Oct. 9, 1752.\r\n\r\n  A case of incest in Deerfield: \"the man was set upon the Gallows\r\n  with a Rope about his Neck for the space of one Hour, to be whipped\r\n  in his Way from thence to the Goal 30 stripes, and to wear a Capital\r\n  I of two Inches long, and proportionable Bigness on his upper\r\n  Garment for ever. Sentence against the Woman, for special Reasons,\r\n  we hear, is respited for the present.\"--_Boston Evening-Post_, Oct.\r\n  7, 1754.\r\n\r\n  At the Superior Court held in Cambridge last week, one Hannah Dudley\r\n  of Lincoln was convicted of repeatedly commiting Adultery and\r\n  Fornication with her own Mother's husband, an old Man of 76 years of\r\n  age. She was sentenced to be set upon the Gallows for the space of\r\n  one Hour, with a Rope about her Neck, and the other end cast over\r\n  the Gallows, and in the way from thence to the Common Goal, that she\r\n  be severely whipped 30 stripes, and that she for ever after wear a\r\n  Capital I of two inches long and proportionable bigness cut out in\r\n  Cloth of a different Colour to her Cloaths, and sewed upon her upper\r\n  Garment on the outside of her arm, or on her Back, in Open View. [No\r\n  further mention is made of the step-father.]--_Boston News-Letter_,\r\n  Aug. 16, 1759.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts did not purge her laws from these ignominous\r\npunishments until 1813 when whipping, branding, the stocks, the\r\npillory, cutting off ears, slitting noses, boring tongues, etc.,\r\nwere done away with.\r\n\r\nThere lived in Salem, nearly three centuries ago, a woman whose\r\nstory is told by Governor Winthrop and the records of the Quarterly\r\nCourts. She was, in a sense, a forerunner of Anne Hutchinson and we\r\nmay fancy at heart a suffragette. Her story gives you an outline\r\npicture of the manners of the times in a few details. Her name\r\nwas Mary Oliver and her criminal record begins in June, 1638.\r\nGovernor Winthrop relates: \"Amongst the rest, there was a woman in\r\nSalem, one Oliver, his wife, who had suffered somewhat in England\r\nby refusing to bow at the name of Jesus, though otherwise she was\r\nconformable to all their orders. She was (for ability of speech,\r\nand appearance of zeal and devotion) far before Mrs. Hutchinson,\r\nand so the fitter instrument to have done hurt, but that she was\r\npoor and had little acquaintance. She took offence at this, that she\r\nmight not be admitted to the Lord's supper without giving public\r\nsatisfaction to the church of her faith, etc., and covenanting or\r\nprofessing to walk with them according to the rule of the gospel; so\r\nas upon the sacrament day she openly called for it, stood to plead\r\nher right, though she were denied; and would not forbear, before\r\nthe magistrate, Mr. Endecott, did threaten to send the constable to\r\nput her forth. This woman was brought to the Court for disturbing\r\nthe peace in the church, etc., and there she gave such premptory\r\nanswers, as she was committed till she should find surities for her\r\ngood behavior. After she had been in prison three or four days, she\r\nmade means to the Governor and submitted herself, and acknowledged\r\nher fault in disturbing the church; whereupon he took her husband's\r\nbond for her good behavior, and discharged her out of prison. But\r\nhe found, after, that she still held her former opinions, which\r\nwere very dangerous, as, (I) that the church is the head of the\r\npeople, both magistrates and ministers, met together and that these\r\nhave power to ordain ministers, etc. (II) That all that dwell in\r\nthe same town, and will profess their faith in Christ Jesus, ought\r\nto be received to the sacraments there; and that she was persuaded\r\nthat, if Paul were at Salem, he would call all the inhabitants there\r\nsaints. (III) That excommunication is no other but when Christians\r\nwithdraw private communion from one that hath offended.\" September\r\n24, 1639, this Mary Oliver was sentenced to prison in Boston\r\nindefinitely for her speeches at the arrival of newcomers. She was\r\nto be taken by the constables of Salem and Lynn to the prison in\r\nBoston. Her husband Thomas Oliver was bound in £20 for his wife's\r\nappearance at the next court in Boston.\r\n\r\nGovernor Winthrop continues: \"About five years after, this woman was\r\nadjudged to be whipped for reproaching the magistrates. She stood\r\nwithout tying, and bore her punishment with a masculine spirit,\r\nglorying in her suffering. But after (when she came to consider the\r\nreproach, which would stick by her, etc.) she was much dejected\r\nabout it. She had a cleft stick put on her tongue half an hour for\r\nreproaching the elders.\"\r\n\r\nMarch 2, 1647-8, Mary Oliver was fined for working on the Sabbath\r\nday in time of public exercise; also for abusing Capt. Hathorne,\r\nuttering divers mutinous speeches, and denying the morality of\r\nthe Sabbath. She was sentenced to sit in the stocks one hour next\r\nlecture day, if the weather be moderate; also for saying \"You in New\r\nEngland are thieves and Robbers\" and for saying to Mr. Gutch that\r\nshe hoped to tear his flesh in pieces and all such as he was. For\r\nthis she was bound to good behavior, and refusing to give bond was\r\nsent to Boston jail, and if she remained in the court's jurisdiction\r\nwas to answer to further complaints at the next Salem Court.\r\n\r\nIt appears from depositions that she went to Robert Gutch's house in\r\nsuch gladness of spirit that he couldn't understand it, and she said\r\nto some there, not members, \"Lift up your heads, your redemption\r\ndraweth near,\" and when reminded what she already had been punished\r\nfor, she said that she came out of that with a scarf and a ring.\r\n\r\nNovember 15, 1648, Mary Oliver for living from her husband, was\r\nordered to go to him before the next court, and in December she\r\nbrought suit against John Robinson for false imprisonment, taking\r\nher in a violent manner and putting her in the stocks. She recovered\r\na judgment of 10s. damages. The following February Mary Oliver was\r\nagain presented at Court for living from her husband, and in July,\r\nhaving been ordered to go to her husband in England by the next\r\nship, she was further enjoyned to go by the next opportunity on\r\npenalty of 20 li.\r\n\r\nNovember 13, 1649, Mary Oliver was presented for stealing goats, and\r\na month later she was presented for speaking against the Governor,\r\nsaying that he was unjust, corrupt and a wretch, and that he made\r\nher pay for stealing two goats when there was no proof in the world\r\nof it. She was sentenced to be whipped next lecture day at Salem, if\r\nthe weather be moderate, not exceeding twenty stripes. Capt. William\r\nHathorne and Mr. Emanuel Downing were to see the sentence executed.\r\nAt the same court George Ropes complained that Mary Oliver kept away\r\na spade of his and she was fined 5s.\r\n\r\nFebruary 28, 1649-50, Mary Oliver thus far had escaped the second\r\nwhipping, for at her request Mr. Batter asked that her sentence be\r\nrespited, which the Court granted \"if she doe go into the Bay with\r\nJoseph Hardy this day or when he goeth next into the Bay with his\r\nvessell\" otherwise she was to be called forth by Mr. Downing and\r\nCapt. Hathorne and be punished. If she returned, the punishment was\r\nto hold good.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mary Oliver's fine was remitted to the end that she use\r\nit in transporting herself and children out of this jurisdiction\r\nwithin three weeks. And there ended her turbulent career in the town\r\nof Salem, so far as the Court records show.\r\n\r\nUntil comparatively recent times New England shipping sailed the\r\nseas in frequent danger of attack by pirate vessels. Before the\r\ntown of Boston was settled, Capt. John Smith, \"the Admiral of New\r\nEngland,\" wrote: \"As in all lands where there are many people,\r\nthere are some theeves, so in all Seas much frequented, there are\r\nsome Pyrats,\" and as early as the summer of 1632, one Dixey Bull\r\nwas plundering small trading vessels on the Maine coast and looting\r\nthe settlement at Pemaquid. Shipping, sailing to and from England,\r\nwas obliged to run the gauntlet of the Dutch and French privateers\r\nand the so-called pirates sailing out of Flushing and Ostend made\r\nseveral captures that affected the fortunes of the Boston traders.\r\nIn 1644, the Great and General Court sitting in Boston, granted a\r\ncommission to Capt. Thomas Bredcake to take Turkish pirates--the\r\nAlgerines--who were a constant danger to vessels trading with Spain.\r\nJohn Hull, the mint-master who made the \"pine tree shillings,\" had a\r\nbrother Edward, who went a-pirating in Long Island Sound and after\r\ndividing the plunder made for England.\r\n\r\nIt was the treaty of peace between England and Spain, signed at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle in 1668, that contributed largely to the great\r\nincrease of piracy in the West Indies and along the New England\r\ncoast. The peace released a great many men who found themselves\r\nunable to obtain employment in merchant ships and this was\r\nparticularly true in the West Indies where the colonial governors\r\nhad commissioned a large number of privateers. It was but a step\r\nforward to continue that fine work without a commission after\r\nthe war was over and to the mind of the needy seaman there was\r\nvery little distinction between the lawfulness of one and the\r\nunlawfulness of the other. The suppression of buccaneering in the\r\nWest Indies happened not long after and many of these adventurers\r\nraised a black flag and preyed upon the ships of every nation. The\r\noperation of the Navigation Acts also led to insecurity on the high\r\nseas and eventually to outright piracy; and so it came about that\r\nthe pirate, the privateer, and the armed merchantman, often blended\r\nthe one into the other.\r\n\r\nThe first trial and execution of pirates in Boston took place in\r\n1672. Rev. Cotton Mather, the pastor of the North Church, Boston, in\r\nhis \"History of Some Criminals Executed in this Land,\" relates the\r\nstory of the seizure of the ship _Antonio_, off the Spanish coast.\r\nShe was owned in England and her crew quarrelled with the master\r\nand at last rose and turned him adrift in the ship's longboat with\r\na small quantity of provisions. With him went some of the officers\r\nof the ship. The mutineers, or pirates as they were characterized\r\nat the time, then set sail for New England and on their arrival\r\nin Boston they were sheltered and for a time concealed by Major\r\nNicholas Shapleigh, a merchant in Charlestown. He was also accused\r\nof aiding them in their attempt to get away. Meanwhile, \"by a\r\nsurprising providence of God, the Master, with his Afflicted Company\r\nin the Long-boat, also arrived; all, Except one who Dyed of the\r\nBarbarous Usage.\r\n\r\n\"The Countenance of the _Master_, who now become Terrible to\r\nthe Rebellious _Men_, though they had _Escaped the Sea_, yet\r\n_Vengeance would not suffer them to Live a Shore_. At his Instance\r\nand Complaint, they were Apprehended; and the Ringleaders of this\r\nMurderous Pyracy, had sentence of Death Executed on them, in\r\n_Boston_.\"\r\n\r\nThe three men who were executed were William Forrest, Alexander\r\nWilson, and John Smith. As for Major Shapleigh; he was fined five\r\nhundred pounds, which amount was afterwards abated to three hundred\r\npounds because of \"his estate not being able to beare it.\"\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary circumstances of this case probably induced the\r\nGeneral Court to draw up the law that was enacted on October 15,\r\n1673. By it piracy became punishable by death according to the local\r\nlaws. Before then a kind of common law was in force in the Colony\r\nbased upon Biblical law as construed by the leading ministers.\r\nOf course the laws of England were theoretically respected, but\r\nMassachusetts, in the wilderness, separated from England by three\r\nthousand miles of stormy water, in practice actually governed\r\nherself and made her own laws.\r\n\r\nIn 1675, the Court of Assistants found John Rhoade and certain\r\nDutchmen guilty of piracy on the Maine coast and they were sentenced\r\nto be hanged \"presently after the lecture.\" Just then, King Philip\r\nwent on the warpath and all else, for the time, was forgotten in the\r\nfearful danger of the emergency. Before long the condemned men were\r\nreleased, some without conditions and others were banished from the\r\nColony. It is fair to say, however, that politics and commercial\r\ngreed were sadly mixed in this trial.\r\n\r\nA bloody fight occurred at Tarpaulin Cove, near Woods Hole, in\r\nOctober, 1689, between a pirate sloop and a vessel sent out from\r\nBoston in pursuit. The pirate was taken and after trial the leader,\r\nCapt. Thomas Pound, late pilot of the King's frigate _Rose_, then\r\nat anchor in the harbor, Thomas Hawkins, a well-connected citizen\r\nof Boston, Thomas Johnston of Boston, \"a limping privateer,\" and\r\none Eleazer Buck, were sentenced to be hanged. When they were on\r\nthe gallows Governor Bradstreet reprieved all save Johnston--\"Which\r\ngave great disgust to the People; I fear it was ill done,\" wrote\r\nJudge Sewall. The same day one William Coward was hanged for piracy\r\ncommitted on the ketch _Elinor_, while at anchor at Nantasket Road.\r\n\r\nThe capture in Boston in 1699, of William Kidd, Joseph Bradish,\r\nborn in Cambridge; Tee Wetherly, James Gillam, and other men\r\nconcerned with the Madagascar pirates, created much excitement, but\r\nthese men were tried in England and gibbetted at Hope Point on the\r\nThames.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1704, a trial for piracy was held in the Old State House,\r\nand the testimony and proceedings were afterwards published.\r\nCaptain John Quelch had sailed from Marblehead, the previous year,\r\nin command of a brigantine commissioned as a privateer. Instead\r\nof proceeding against the French off Newfoundland he had sailed\r\nsouth and on the coast of Brazil had captured and plundered several\r\nPortuguese vessels. While he was absent, a treaty of peace between\r\nEngland and Portugal had been signed and when Quelch returned to\r\nMarblehead harbor he learned that he had piratically taken various\r\nvessels belonging to subjects of \"Her Majesty's good Allie,\" the\r\nKing of Portugal. His arrest and trial followed and with six of\r\nhis ship's company he was sentenced to be hanged on a gallows set\r\nup between high- and low-water mark off a point of land just below\r\nCopp's hill. The condemned were guarded by forty musketeers and the\r\nconstables of the town and were preceded by the Provost Marshal and\r\nhis officers. Great crowds gathered to see the execution. Judge\r\nSewall in his diary comments on the great number of people on\r\nBroughton's hill, as Copp's hill was called at that time.\r\n\r\n\"But when I came to see how the River was cover'd with People, I was\r\namazed: Some say there were 100 Boats. 150 Boats and Canoes, saith\r\nCousin Moodey of York. Mr. Cotton Mather came with Capt. Quelch\r\nand six others for Execution from the Prison to Scarlet's Wharf,\r\nand from thence in the Boat to the place of Execution about midway\r\nbetween Hanson's [_sic_] point and Broughton's Warehouse. When the\r\nscaffold was hoisted to a due height, the seven Malefactors went up:\r\nMr. Mather pray'd for them standing upon the Boat. Ropes were all\r\nfasten'd to the Gallows (save King, who was Repriev'd). When the\r\nscaffold was let to sink, there was such a Screech of the Women that\r\nmy wife heard it sitting in our Entry next the Orchard, and was much\r\nsurprised at it; yet the wind was sou-west. Our house is a full\r\nmile from the place.\"\r\n\r\nCapt. Samuel Bellamy, in the pirate ship _Whydah_, was wrecked\r\non Cape Cod near Wellfleet, the spring of 1717, and 142 men were\r\ndrowned. Six pirates who reached shore were tried in Boston and\r\nsentenced to be hanged \"at Charlestown Ferry within the flux and\r\nreflux of the Sea.\" After the condemned were removed from the\r\ncourtroom the ministers of the town took them in hand and \"bestowed\r\nall possible '_Instructions_ upon the Condemned Criminals; often\r\n_Pray'd_ with them; often _Preached_ to them; often _Examined_ them;\r\nand _Exhorted_ them; and presented them with Books of Piety.'\" At\r\nthe place of execution, Baker and Hoof appeared penitent and the\r\nlatter joined with Van Vorst in singing a Dutch psalm. John Brown,\r\non the contrary, broke out into furious expressions with many oaths\r\nand then fell to reading prayers, \"not very pertinently chosen,\"\r\nremarks the Rev. Cotton Mather. He then made a short speech, at\r\nwhich many in the assembled crowd trembled, in which he advised\r\nsailors to beware of wicked living and if they fell into the hands\r\nof pirates, to have a care what countries they came into. Then the\r\nscaffold fell and six twitching bodies, outlined against the sky,\r\nended the spectacle.\r\n\r\nIn 1724 the head of Capt. John Phillips, the pirate, was brought\r\ninto Boston in pickle. He had been killed by \"forced men\" who had\r\nrisen and taken the pirate ship. Only two of his company lived to\r\nreach Boston for trial and execution, and one of them, John Rose\r\nArcher, the quartermaster, was sentenced to be \"hung up in Irons, to\r\nbe a spectacle, and so a Warning to others.\" The gibbet was erected\r\non Bird Island which was located about half-way between Governor's\r\nIsland and East Boston. In the Marshal's bill for expenses in\r\nconnection with the execution appears the following item:\r\n\r\n\"To Expenses for Victuals and Drink for the Sherifs, Officers and\r\nConstables after the Executions att Mrs. Mary Gilberts her Bill\r\n£3.15.8.\"\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of the English statute relating to piracy was\r\nvariously interpreted in the Colonial courts, and local enactments\r\nsometimes superseded it in actual practice. Previous to 1700,\r\nthe statute required that men accused of piracy should be sent\r\nto England to be tried before a High Court of Admiralty. Pound,\r\nHawkins, Bradish, Kidd, and other known pirates were accordingly\r\nsent in irons to London for trial. But the difficulties and delays,\r\nto say nothing of the expense, induced Parliament by an Act of 11\r\nand 12 William III, to confer authority by which trials for piracy\r\nmight be held by Courts of Admiralty sitting in the Colonies. On the\r\nother hand, the Massachusetts Court of Assistants in 1675 found John\r\nRhoades and others, guilty of piracy. This was in accordance with an\r\norder adopted by the Great and General Court on October 15, 1673.\r\nWhen Robert Munday was tried at Newport, R. I., in 1703, it was by a\r\njury in the ordinary criminal court, in open disregard of the King's\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nThe Courts of Admiralty held in the Colonies were composed of\r\ncertain officials designated in the Royal commission, including\r\nthe Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, the Judge of the Vice-Admiralty\r\nfor the Province, the Chief Justice, the Secretary, Members of the\r\nCouncil, and the Collector of Customs. Counsel was assigned to the\r\naccused to advise and to address the Court \"upon any matter of\r\nlaw,\" but the practice at that time was different from the present.\r\nAccused persons in criminal cases were obliged to conduct their\r\nown defence and their counsel were not permitted to cross-examine\r\nwitnesses, the legal theory at the time being that the facts in the\r\ncase would appear without the necessity of counsel; that the judge\r\ncould be trusted to see this properly done; and the jury would give\r\nthe prisoner the benefit of any reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nTrials occupied but a short time and executions generally took place\r\nwithin a few days after the sentence of the Court was pronounced.\r\nDuring the interval the local clergy labored with the condemned to\r\ninduce repentance, and all the terrors of hell were pictured early\r\nand late. Usually, the prisoners were made the principal figures in\r\na Sunday spectacle and taken through the streets to the meetinghouse\r\nof some prominent minister, there to be gazed at by a congregation\r\nthat crowded the building, while the reverend divine preached a\r\nsermon suited to the occasion. This discourse was invariably\r\nprinted and avidly read by the townsfolk, so that few copies have\r\nsurvived the wear and tear of the years. From these worn pamphlets\r\nmay be learned something of the lives and future of the prisoners as\r\nreflected by the mental attitude of the attending ministers.\r\n\r\nThe day of execution having arrived, the condemned prisoners were\r\nmarched in procession through the crowded streets safely guarded\r\nby musketeers and constables. The procession included prominent\r\nofficials and ministers and was preceded by the Marshal of the\r\nAdmiralty Court carrying \"the Silver Oar,\" his emblem of authority.\r\nThis was usually about three feet long and during the trial was also\r\ncarried by him in the procession of judges to the courtroom where it\r\nwas placed on the table before the Court during the proceedings.\r\n\r\nTime-honored custom, and the Act of Parliament as well, required\r\nthat the gallows should be erected \"in such place upon the sea,\r\nor within the ebbing or flowing thereof, as the President of the\r\nCourt ... shall appoint,\" and this necessitated the construction\r\nof a scaffold or platform suspended from the framework of the\r\ngallows by means of ropes and blocks. When an execution took place\r\non land, that is to say, on solid ground easily approached, it was\r\nthe custom at that time to carry the condemned in a cart under\r\nthe crossarm of the gallows and after the hangman's rope had been\r\nadjusted around the neck and the signal had been given, the cart\r\nwould be driven away and the condemned person left dangling in the\r\nair. In theory, the proper adjustment of the knot in the rope and\r\nthe short fall from the body of the cart when it was driven away,\r\nwould be sufficient to break the bones of the neck and also cause\r\nstrangulation; but in practice this did not always occur.\r\n\r\nWhen pirates were executed on a gallows placed between \"the ebb and\r\nflow of the tide,\" the scaffold on which they stood was allowed\r\nto fall by releasing the ropes holding it suspended in mid-air.\r\nThis was always the climax of the spectacle for which thousands of\r\nspectators had gathered from far and near.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently the judges of a Court of Admiralty had brought\r\nbefore them for trial a pirate whose career had been more infamous\r\nthan the rest. A cruel and bloody-minded fellow fit only for a\r\nhalter,--and then the sentence to be hanged by the neck until dead\r\nwould be followed by another judgment, dooming the lifeless body\r\nof the pirate to be hanged in chains from a gibbet placed on some\r\nisland or jutting point near a ship channel, there to hang \"a sun\r\ndrying\" as a warning to other sailormen of evil intent. In Boston\r\nharbor there were formerly two islands--Bird Island and Nix's\r\nMate--on which pirates were gibbeted.[94] Bird Island long since\r\ndisappeared and ships now anchor where the gibbet formerly stood.\r\nNix's Mate was of such size that early in the eighteenth century\r\nthe selectmen of Boston advertised its rental for the pasturage of\r\ncattle. Today every foot of its soil has been washed away and the\r\npoint of a granite monument alone marks the site of the island where\r\nformerly a pirate hung in chains beside the swiftly flowing tides.\r\n\r\n  [94] On Tuesday the 12th Instant, about 3 p.m. were executed for\r\n  Piracy, Murder, etc., three of the Condemned Persons mentioned in\r\n  our Last viz. _William Fly_, Capt., _Samuel Cole_, Quarter-Master,\r\n  and _Henry Greenville_.... _Fly_ behaved himself very unbecoming\r\n  even to the last; ... Their Bodies were carried in a Boat to a small\r\n  Island call'd Nicks's-Mate, about 2 Leagues from the Town, where\r\n  the above said _Fly_ was hung up in Irons, as a spectacle for the\r\n  warning of others, especially sea-faring men; the other Two were\r\n  buried there.--_Boston News-Letter_, July 7-14, 1726.\r\n\r\nWhat constitutes a crime? It all depends upon the minds of the\r\npeople and oftentimes upon the judges. Manners and crimes vary\r\nwith the centuries as do dress and speech. Here are some of the\r\ncrimes penalized by Essex County Courts before the year 1655, viz.:\r\neavesdropping, meddling, neglecting work, taking tobacco, scolding,\r\nnaughty speeches, profane dancing, kissing, making love without\r\nconsent of friends, uncharitableness to a poor man in distress, bad\r\ngrinding at mill, carelessness about fire, wearing great boots,\r\nwearing broad bone lace and ribbons. Between 1656 and 1662 we find\r\nothers, viz.: abusing your mother-in-law, wicked speeches against\r\na son-in-law, confessing himself a Quaker, cruelty to animals,\r\ndrinking tobacco, _i.e._, smoking, kicking another in the street,\r\nleaving children alone in the house, opprobrious speeches, pulling\r\nhair, pushing his wife, riding behind two fellows at night (this\r\nwas a girl, Lydia by name), selling dear, and sleeping in meeting.\r\nThe next five years reveal the following, viz.: breaking the ninth\r\ncommandment, dangerous well, digging up the grave of the Sagamore of\r\nAgawam, going naked into the meetinghouse, playing cards, rebellious\r\nspeeches to parents, reporting a scandalous lie, reproaching the\r\nminister, selling strong water by small measure, and dissenting from\r\nthe rest of the jury.\r\n\r\nWith such minute supervision of the daily life of the colonists\r\nit can readily be appreciated that it was an age for gossiping,\r\nmeddlesome interference with individual life and liberty and that\r\nin the course of time nearly every one came before the courts as\r\ncomplainant, defendant or witness. There were few amusements or\r\nintellectual diversions and they could only dwell on the gossip and\r\nsmall doings of their immediate surroundings. But all the while\r\nthere was underlying respect for law, religion and the rights of\r\nothers. The fundamental principles of human life were much the same\r\nas at the present day, and men and women lived together then as now\r\nand as they always will--with respect and love.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Are the Times Improving?_\r\n\r\nEdward Johnson's estimate in his _Wonder-working Providence_\r\nsupposes in 1643, a population in Massachusetts of about 15,000.\r\nThere were then 31 towns in the Bay Colony, of which 10 were within\r\nthe limits of the present Essex County. The population of these\r\n10 towns was probably about 6,000. They were located for the most\r\npart along the shore line. The same geographical area in 1915 had\r\na population of about 360,000, or exactly 60 times as great as the\r\npopulation in 1643, 272 years before.\r\n\r\n                                                            _1643_  _1915_\r\n  Population                                                6,000   360,000\r\n    Increase in 272 years--60 times as great.\r\n    In 1643, 1 person in 60 was a criminal.\r\n    In 1915, 1 person in 600 was a criminal.\r\n      10 times more crime in 1643 according to population.\r\n  Murder (4), manslaughter (6), assault to murder (2)           0     12\r\n  Arson                                                         0      7\r\n  Robbery, breaking and entering, etc.                          8    165\r\n  Assault of various kinds                                     10     86\r\n  Drunkenness                                                   7     70\r\n  Illegal sale of liquor                                        0     74\r\n  Sexual crimes, including bastardy, streetwalking, etc.        6     71\r\n    Living from wife                                           14      0\r\n    Non-support and desertion                                   0     48\r\n  Profanity, reproachful speeches, evil speeches, etc.         13      2\r\n  Extortion, oppression, shortweight, etc.                      7      5\r\n  Idle and disorderly                                           3     22\r\n  Slander and libel                                             1      3\r\n  Forgery                                                       0      3\r\n  Lying and perjury                                             2      0\r\n  Breaking the Sabbath                                          5      1\r\n  Misc.

The following, with two\r\nexceptions, have been gleaned from court records where originally\r\nthey were submitted as evidence in suits at law. They are of the\r\ngreatest interest in connection with present day restoration work\r\nas they preserve detailed information of indisputable authority\r\nin relation to early building construction in the Bay Colony. The\r\ngable window, the second story jet, the stool window and casement\r\nsash, the catted chimney and the treatment of the inner and outer\r\nwalls of the house have much curious interest at the present time.\r\nThese architectural features long since fell into disuse and only\r\nhere and there has a fragment survived. Two centuries ago the towns\r\nin New England must have presented an appearance most picturesque\r\nto our twentieth-century eyes. The dwellings seem to have been\r\nstudies in projecting angles, strangely embellished with pinnacles,\r\npendants and carved work. The unpainted and time-stained walls, the\r\nsmall windows and elaborate chimney tops, the narrow and curiously\r\nfenced ways, winding among the irregularly placed buildings,\r\nall contributed to the quaintness of the picture. The following\r\nagreements between builder and owner should help to solve some of\r\nthe debated problems of this bygone construction that now confront\r\nthose interested in the preservation and restoration of our early\r\nNew England dwellings.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRACT TO BUILD THE FIRST MEETINGHOUSE IN MALDEN, NOVEMBER 11, 1658\r\n\r\nArticles of agreement made and concluded ye 11th day of ye ninth\r\nmo., 1658, betweene Job Lane of Malden, on the one partie,\r\ncarpenter, and William Brakenbury, Lieut.

WAYTE.\r\n\r\n  Witness,\r\n  JOSEPH HILLS,\r\n  GERSHOM HILLS.\r\n\r\nNOTE. This contract for building the first meetinghouse in Malden is\r\ncopied from the _Bi-Centennial Book of Malden_, 1850, pages 123-125.\r\nThe original document then in existence has since disappeared. The\r\ncontract provides for the construction of a building of the type\r\nalmost universal in New England at that time, of which an example\r\nstill exists at Hingham--the \"Ship Meeting House,\" so-called. The\r\nsquare meetinghouse with hip roof surmounted by a \"territ,\" and at\r\na somewhat later date supplied with \"lucomb\" (dormer) windows in\r\nthe roof, was the type of public building in the Massachusetts Bay\r\nColony that prevailed well into the eighteenth century, especially\r\nin the country towns. The \"territ\" or belfry seems to have been\r\ncommon, but only the larger towns were supplied with a bell. The\r\nbell was rung from the central aisle, the bell rope coming down in\r\nthe center of the auditorium.\r\n\r\nIn the Malden meetinghouse, the \"territ\" was built as provided in\r\nthe contract, but for some now unknown reason the bell was not\r\nhung in it but placed in a framework erected nearby, below a large\r\nrock which thereby obtained its name--\"Bell Rock,\" a name that has\r\ncontinued until the present time.\r\n\r\nMalden was able to afford the luxury of plastered walls surfaced\r\nwith lime, but the ceiling showed the joists and boarding. In\r\nshingling the roof a distinction was made between long and short\r\nshingles. The lower windows were made up with \"leaves,\" _i.e._,\r\nthey were double casements, and each opening contained sixteen\r\nfeet of glass, thereby indicating sash about twenty-eight by forty\r\ninches in size. The single casement windows placed high, just\r\nunder the coving, also were about the same size and undoubtedly\r\nwere fixed sash, _i.e._, were not hinged. Two smaller windows on\r\nthe south side, placed just above the girth, supplied additional\r\nlight on either side of the pulpit. The deacons' seat at that time\r\nwas located in front of the pulpit and faced the congregation. The\r\npossible use of brick for the underpinning is a surprising feature,\r\nespecially in a country town. In fact, the use of underpinning at\r\nthat time seems to have been uncommon.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRACT TO BUILD A MINISTER'S HOUSE AT MARLBOROUGH, MASS., IN 1661\r\n\r\nThis indenture made the fifth day of Aprill one thousand six hundred\r\nand sixty one and between obadias Ward, Christopher Banyster and\r\nRichard Barnes of the Towne of Marlborough on ye one party; And the\r\nInhabitants and all the Proprietors of the same Towne on ye other\r\nparty Witnesseth That ye said obadias Waed, Christopher Banyster and\r\nRich'd Barnes hath covenanted, promised and bargained to build a\r\nfframe for the minister's house, every way like to ye fframe yt Jno\r\nRuddock hath built for himselfe in ye afores'd Town of Marlborough,\r\nthe house or fframe is to bee a Girt house thirty-seven foote Long,\r\neighteen foote wide and twelve foote (between Joynts) and a halfe,\r\nthe studs standing at such distance that A foure foote and a halfe\r\nClaboard may reach three studs; and two ffloores of juice [_sic_]\r\nand foure windows on the foreside and two windows at the west end\r\nand two Gables on the foreside of ten foote wide; and eight foote\r\nSparr, with two small windows on the foreside of the Gables and they\r\nare to ffell all the tinber and bring it in place and do all yt\r\nbelongs to the fframe only the Towne is to helpe raise the affores'd\r\nfframe and all this worke is to bee done and ye fframe raised within\r\na ffortnight after Michll tyde; And this being done the Town of\r\nMarlborough doth promise and engage to pay unto them the sd obadias\r\nWard, Christopher Banyster and Rich'rd Barnes the sume of ffifteene\r\nPounds in Corne within fourteen daies after the house is raised the\r\none halfe of it and the other halfe some time in March; the whole\r\npaye is to be one third in Wheat and one third in Rie and the other\r\nthird in Indian Corn, the halfe in Wheat and Rie to be paid fourteen\r\ndaies after the house is up in Wheat and Rie and the other halfe in\r\nRie and Indian some time in March; wheat at four shillings and sixe\r\npence a bushell and is to be pd at Sudbury betweene Petter King's\r\nand Serient Woods house in the streete.--_Marlborough, Mass., Town\r\nRecords._\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRACT FOR THE FRAME OF A BOSTON HOUSE, AUGUST 20, 1679\r\n\r\nArticles of Agreement indented made and Concluded the twentieth day\r\nof August Ano Domi One thousand six hundred Seventy and nine.

This contract provides for the frame of a house and not for\r\na complete building. But it is of unusual interest for it supplies\r\nproof of the existence in Boston of a house having two gables on\r\neach side of the roof, _i.e._, six gables on a rectangular building\r\ntwenty-seven by thirty feet in size.\r\n\r\nRobert Taft, of Braintree, an ancestor of ex-President Taft,\r\ndelivered the frame, but before he had completed the work Bateman\r\nentered into possession and set his carpenters at work to finish\r\nthe building. Taft brought suit to recover payment for the frame and\r\nthe Court gave a verdict in his favor, from which Bateman appealed.\r\nFrom the testimony it appears that on the ground floor there were\r\ntwo rooms, one of which was eleven by twenty-four feet, and a space\r\nnine by eight feet had been left in which to build the chimney. The\r\n\"articles of agreement\" required that Taft provide for fourteen\r\nwindows but he put up \"six more than my Couanant was.\" Bateman, on\r\nthe other hand, claimed that the frame was \"the weakest slenderest\r\nand most dozed timber that hath been Seen ... most of the timber\r\nWany & on many of the Sumers the Bark left on to make it square and\r\nwch Indeed was the Occasion of all this Trouble.\"\r\n\r\nThis house was built for a \"shop keeper\" and probably the long front\r\nroom on the ground floor was to be used for a shop. It was located\r\nat what is now the southeasterly corner of North and Blackstone\r\nstreets, the canal to the mill pond being on the northerly end of\r\nthe house and the harbor behind it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRACT TO BUILD THE FIRST KING'S CHAPEL, BOSTON JULY 21, 1688\r\n\r\nMemorandum it is agreed by and between John Holebrook of Weymouth\r\nin the county of Suffolk, housewright, Stephen French of the same\r\nplace, housewright--and Jacob Nash of the same place housewright of\r\nthe one part and Anthony Hayward Esq of the other part as followeth\r\n(that is to say) Imprimis the said John Holebrooke, Stephen French &\r\nJacob Nash doe Covenant pmise and agree to and with the said Anthony\r\nHeywood his heires Admrs and Assins and Also in the consideracion\r\nherein after mencioned that they the said John Holebrooke Stephen\r\nFrench and Jacob Nash or some or one of them shall & will by or\r\nbefore the last day of November now next ensueing Erect sett up and\r\nbuild on such spott of Ground as the sd Anthony Heywood shall for\r\nthat end assigne of good sound timber well & workmanlike wrought one\r\nframe of building of the Dimensions following (that is to say) in\r\nlength fifty four feet in breadth thirty six feet studd twenty feet\r\nwith five windows in the front five windows in the rear and two\r\nwindows at each end of such dimensions as are sett downe in a platt\r\nof the same made by Mr. P.

The foundations for the first Episcopal Chapel in America\r\nwere laid in Boston in October, 1688, following a long controversy\r\nbetween the local authorities and the representatives of the King\r\nand their followers. Little has been known as to the details of\r\nthe construction of this building. Judge Sewell records in his\r\nDiary, under date of Oct. 16, 1688, \"The ground-sills of ye Chh\r\nare laid ye stone-foundation being finished.\" The records of the\r\nChurch preserve no information and any contemporaneous documents\r\nseem to have disappeared with the exception of this contract for\r\nthe construction of the building which is now printed for the first\r\ntime. The exact size of the building heretofore has not been known.\r\nRev. Henry Wilder Foote in his _Annals of King's Chapel_, Boston,\r\n1882, supplies no information although he states that the Chapel was\r\nbuilt at a cost of £284.16.0, an amount that probably represents\r\nthe total cost including furnishings. In the _Annual Report of the\r\nBoston Cemetery Commissioners_ for 1902-3, an attempt is made to\r\nshow by a plan, partly based upon grants of land by the town, the\r\nseveral enlargements of the Chapel made at various times. Here,\r\nthe size of the first building is shown to have been forty-six by\r\nsixty-four feet, proportions quite at variance with the correct\r\nsize--thirty-six by fifty-four feet, as shown in the contract here\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nThe windows, probably of generous proportions for the time, were\r\nto be supplied with iron casements filled with \"square glasse.\"\r\nIron casement sash probably were rare in Massachusetts at that\r\ntime. One is mentioned in the inventory of the estate of Edward\r\nWharton, of Salem, in 1678, valued at six shillings. Square glass\r\nis most unusual. It probably was cut to size at special order as\r\ndiamond-shaped glass was in common use. In January, 1752, and\r\nprobably much later, \"Diamond Glass, and 6 by 4\" were still sold in\r\nthe shops in Boston. These glass windows were a source of constant\r\nexpense to the church wardens because of the popular dislike of the\r\ntownspeople and the antagonism of the Puritan small boy. The first\r\nservice was held in the Chapel, June 30, 1689. Four moths later\r\nthe church records show a payment of £5.10.0. \"for mending church\r\nwindows.\" On November 5, 1691, was taken \"A Colecktion for mendin ye\r\nchurch winders\" and a few days later £7.0.0. was paid out for the\r\nwork. The next March, six shillings was paid for \"24 Squ: glas.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD THREE-LIGHT CASEMENT WINDOW FRAME IN GABLE, _ca._\r\n1690 From Isham, _Early American Houses_, 1928.
