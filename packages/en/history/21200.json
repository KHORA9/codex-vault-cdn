SHUCKBURGH, M.A.\r\n\r\nLATE FELLOW OF EMMANUEL COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE\r\nAUTHOR OF A TRANSLATION OF POLYBIUS, A HISTORY OF ROME, ETC\r\n\r\n\r\nIN FOUR VOLUMES\r\n\r\nVOL. I. B.C. 68-52\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON\r\nGEORGE BELL AND SONS\r\n1899\r\n\r\n\r\nCHISWICK PRESS:--CHARLES WHITTINGHAM AND CO.\r\nTOOKS COURT, CHANCERY LANE, LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this book is to give the English-speaking public, in a\r\nconvenient form, as faithful and readable a copy as the translator was\r\ncapable of making of a document unique in the literature of antiquity.\r\nWhether we regard the correspondence of Cicero from the point of view of\r\nthe biographer and observer of character, the historian, or the lover of\r\n_belles lettres_, it is equally worthy of study. It seems needless to\r\ndwell on the immense historical importance of letters written by\r\nprominent actors in one of the decisive periods of the world's history,\r\nwhen the great Republic, that had spread its victorious arms, and its\r\nlaw and discipline, over the greater part of the known world, was in the\r\nthroes of its change from the old order to the new. If we would\r\nunderstand--as who would not?--the motives and aims of the men who acted\r\nin that great drama, there is nowhere that we can go with better hope of\r\ndoing so than to these letters. To the student of character also the\r\npersonality of Cicero must always have a great fascination. Statesman,\r\norator, man of letters, father, husband, brother, and friend--in all\r\nthese capacities he comes before us with singular vividness. In every\r\none of them he will doubtless rouse different feelings in different\r\nminds. But though he will still, as he did in his lifetime, excite\r\nvehement disapproval as well as strong admiration, he will never, I\r\nthink, appear to anyone dull or uninteresting. In the greater part of\r\nhis letters he is not posing or assuming a character; he lets us only\r\ntoo frankly into his weaknesses and his vanities, as well as his\r\ngenerous admirations and warm affections. Whether he is weeping, or\r\nangry, or exulting, or eager for compliments, or vain of his abilities\r\nand achievements, he is not a phantasm or a farceur, but a human being\r\nwith fiercely-beating pulse and hot blood.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of the task which I have been bold enough to undertake\r\nis well known to scholars, and may explain, though perhaps not excuse,\r\nthe defects of my work. One who undertakes to express the thoughts of\r\nantiquity in modern idiom goes to his task with his eyes open, and has\r\nno right at every stumbling-block or pitfall to bemoan his unhappy fate.\r\nSo also with the particular difficulties presented by the great founder\r\nof Latin style--his constant use of superlatives, his doubling and\r\ntrebling of nearly synonymous terms, the endless shades of meaning in\r\nsuch common words as _officium_, _fides_, _studium_, _humanitas_,\r\n_dignitas_, and the like--all these the translator has to take in the\r\nday's work. Finally, there are the hard nuts to crack--often very\r\nhard--presented by corruption of the text. Such problems, though,\r\nrelatively with other ancient works, not perhaps excessively numerous,\r\nare yet sufficiently numerous and sufficiently difficult. But besides\r\nthese, which are the natural incidents of such work, there is the\r\nspecial difficulty that the letters are frequently answers to others\r\nwhich we do not possess, and which alone can fully explain the meaning\r\nof sentences which must remain enigmatical to us; or they refer to\r\nmatters by a word or phrase of almost telegraphic abruptness, with which\r\nthe recipient was well acquainted, but as to which we are reduced to\r\nguessing. When, however, all such insoluble difficulties are allowed\r\nfor, which after all in absolute bulk are very small, there should (if\r\nthe present version is at all worthy) be enough that is perfectly plain\r\nto everyone, and generally of the highest interest.\r\n\r\nI had no intention of writing a commentary on the language of Cicero or\r\nhis correspondents, and my translation must, as a rule, be taken for the\r\nonly expression of my judgment formed after reading and weighing the\r\narguments of commentators. I meant only to add notes on persons and\r\nthings enabling the reader to use the letters for biographical, social,\r\nand historical study. I should have liked to dedicate it by the words\r\n_Boswellianus Boswellianis_. But I found that the difficulties of the\r\ntext compelled me to add a word here and there as to the solution of\r\nthem which I preferred, or had myself to suggest. Such notes are very\r\nrare, and rather meant as danger signals than critical discussions. I\r\nhave followed in the main the chronological arrangement of the letters\r\nadopted by Messrs. Tyrrell and Purser, to whose great work my\r\nobligations are extremely numerous. If, as is the case, I have not\r\nalways been able to accept their conclusions, it is none the less true\r\nthat their brilliant labours have infinitely lightened my task, and\r\nperhaps made it even possible.\r\n\r\nI ought to mention that I have adopted the English mode of dating,\r\nwriting, for instance, July and August, though Cicero repudiated the\r\nformer and, of course, never heard of the latter. I have also refrained\r\ngenerally from attempting to represent his Greek by French, partly\r\nbecause I fear I should have done it ill, and partly because it is not\r\nin him as in an English writer who lards his sentences with French. It\r\nis almost confined to the letters to Atticus, to whom Greek was a second\r\nmother-tongue, and often, I think, is a quotation from him. It does not\r\nreally represent Cicero's ordinary style.\r\n\r\nOne excuse for my boldness in venturing upon the work is the fact that\r\nno complete translation exists in English. Mr. Jeans has published a\r\nbrilliant translation of a selection of some of the best of the letters.\r\nBut still it is not the whole. The last century versions of Melmoth and\r\nHerbenden have many excellences; but they are not complete either (the\r\nletters to Brutus, for instance, having been discovered since), and\r\nneed, at any rate, a somewhat searching revision. Besides, with many\r\ngraces of style, they may perhaps prove less attractive now than they\r\ndid a century ago. At any rate it is done, and I must bear with what\r\nequanimity nature has given me the strictures of critics, who doubtless\r\nwill find, if so minded, many blemishes to set off against, and perhaps\r\noutweigh, any merit my translation may have. I must bear that as well as\r\nI may. But no critic can take from me the days and nights spent in close\r\ncommunion with Rome's greatest intellect, or the endless pleasure of\r\nsolving the perpetually recurring problem of how best to transfer a\r\ngreat writer's thoughts and feelings from one language to another:\r\n\r\n    \"Cæsar in hoc potuit iuris habere nihil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS IN VOLUME I\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Number\r\n                      in this\r\n                      Translation\r\n\r\nFam.

It does\r\nnot become continuous till the year after his consulship (B.C. 62).\r\nThere are no letters in the year of the consulship itself or the year of\r\nhis canvass for the consulship (B.C. 64 and 63). It begins in B.C. 68,\r\nand between that date and B.C. 65 there are only eleven letters. We\r\nhave, therefore, nothing exactly contemporaneous to help us to form a\r\njudgment on the great event which coloured so much of his after life,\r\nthe suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy and the execution of the\r\nconspirators, in the last month of his consulship. But setting aside the\r\nfirst eleven letters, we have from that time forward a correspondence\r\nillustrating, as no other document in antiquity does, the hopes and\r\nfears, the doubts and difficulties, of a keen politician living through\r\nthe most momentous period of Roman history, the period of the fall of\r\nthe Republic, beginning with Pompey's return from the East in B.C. 62,\r\nand ending with the appearance of the young Octavian on the scene and\r\nthe formation of the Triumvirate in B.C. 43, of whose victims Cicero was\r\none of the first and most illustrious. It is by his conduct and speeches\r\nduring this period that Cicero's claim to be a statesman and a patriot\r\nmust be judged, and by his writings in the same period that his place in\r\nliterature must chiefly be assigned. Before B.C. 63 his biography, if we\r\nhad it, would be that of the advocate and the official, no doubt with\r\ncertain general views on political questions as they occurred, but not\r\nyet committed definitely to a party, or inclined to regard politics as\r\nthe absorbing interest of his life. In his early youth his hero had\r\nbeen his fellow townsman Marius, in whose honour he composed a poem\r\nabout the time of taking the _toga virilis_. But it was as the\r\nsuccessful general, and before the days of the civil war. And though he\r\nserved in the army of Sulla in the Marsic war (B.C. 90-88), he always\r\nregarded his cruelties with horror, however much he may have afterwards\r\napproved of certain points of his legislation. It was not till the\r\nconsulship that he became definitely a party man[1] and an Optimate, and\r\neven then his feelings were much distracted by a strong\r\nbelief--strangely ill-founded--that Pompey would be as successful as a\r\nstatesman as he had been fortunate as a general. For him he had also a\r\nwarm personal attachment, which never seems to have wholly died out, in\r\nspite of much petulance of language. This partly accounts for the\r\nsurrender of B.C. 56, and his acquiescence in the policy of the\r\ntriumvirs, an acquiescence never hearty indeed, as far as Cæsar and\r\nCrassus were concerned, but in which he consoled himself with the belief\r\nthat nothing very unconstitutional could be done while Pompey was\r\npractically directing affairs at Rome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The various nature of the Correspondence.]\r\n\r\nIt is through this period of political change and excitement that the\r\ncorrespondence will take us, with some important gaps indeed, but on the\r\nwhole fullest when it is most wanted to shew the feelings and motives\r\nguiding the active politicians of the day, or at any rate the effect\r\nwhich events had upon one eager and acute intellect and sensitive heart.\r\nOne charm of the correspondence is variety. There is almost every sort\r\nof letter. Those to Atticus are unstudied, spontaneous, and reflect the\r\nvarying moods of the writer. At times of special excitement they follow\r\neach other day by day, and sometimes more than once in the same day; and\r\nthe writer seems to conceal nothing, however much it might expose him to\r\nridicule, and to the charge of fickleness, weakness, or even cowardice.\r\nThose addressed to other friends are sometimes familiar and playful,\r\nsometimes angry and indignant. Some of them are careful and elaborate\r\nstate papers, others mere formal introductions and recommendations.\r\nBusiness, literature, and philosophy all have their share in them; and,\r\nwhat is so rare in ancient literature, the family relations of the\r\nwriter, his dealings with wife, son, and daughter, brother and nephew,\r\nand sons-in-law, are all depicted for us, often with the utmost\r\nfrankness. After reading them we seem to know Cicero the man, as well as\r\nCicero the statesman and orator. The eleven letters which precede the\r\nconsulship are happily, from this point of view, addressed to Atticus.\r\nFor it was to Atticus that he wrote with the least concealment, and with\r\nthe confidence that any detail, however small, which concerned himself\r\nwould be interesting to his correspondent. It is well, therefore, that,\r\nthough we thus come into his life when it was more than half over, we\r\nshould at once hear his genuine sentiments on whatever subjects he may\r\nbe speaking. Besides his own, we have about ninety letters to Cicero\r\nfrom some of the chief men of the day--Pompey, Cæsar, Cato, Brutus,\r\nAntony, and many others. They are of very various excellence. The best\r\nof them are by much less known men. Neither Pompey nor Cæsar were good\r\nletter-writers, or, if the latter was so, he was too busy to use his\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cicero's position previous to the beginning of the\r\nCorrespondence in B.C. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quæstor, B.C. 75.]\r\n\r\nThe letters begin, then, in B.C. 68, when Cicero was in his\r\nthirty-seventh year. He was already a man of established reputation both\r\nas a pleader and a writer. Rhetorical treatises (B.C. 86), translations\r\nfrom Xenophon and Plato (B.C. 84), and from the poems of Aratus (B.C.\r\n81), had given evidence of a varied literary interest and a promise of\r\nfuture eminence, while his success as an advocate had led to the first\r\nstep in the official _cursus honorum_ by his becoming a quæstor in B.C.\r\n75. The lot assigned Lilybæum as his sphere of work, and though the\r\nduties of a quæstor in Sicily were not such as to bring a man's name\r\nmuch before the Roman public, Cicero plumes himself, as was not unusual\r\nwith him, on the integrity and energy which he displayed in his\r\nadministration. He has indeed the honesty to tell against himself the\r\nstory of the acquaintance who, meeting him at Puteoli on his return\r\njourney, asked him what day he had left Rome and what was the news\r\nthere. When he answered rather crossly that he had just come from\r\nSicily, another acquaintance put in with \"Why, of course. Didn't you\r\nknow he has just been quæstor _at Syracuse_!\" At any rate he had done\r\nsufficiently well in Lilybæum to give him his next step, the ædileship\r\nto which he was elected B.C. 70, and to induce the Sicilians to apply to\r\nhim, when in that year they desired the prosecution of the extortionate\r\nVerres. His energy and success in this business raised him, without\r\nquestion, to the first rank of advocates, and pledged him to a righteous\r\npolicy in regard to the government of the provinces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cicero's Boyhood and Education.]\r\n\r\nStill Cicero was a _novus homo_, and the jealous exclusiveness of the\r\ngreat families at Rome might yet prevent his attainment of the highest\r\noffice of all. When the correspondence opens he is a candidate for the\r\nprætorship, which he obtained without difficulty, at the head of the\r\npoll. But his birth might still be a bar to the consulship. His father,\r\nM. Tullius, lived at Arpinum, an ancient city of the Volscians and\r\nafterwards of the Samnites, which had long enjoyed a partial, and from\r\nB.C. 188 a complete, Roman franchise, and was included in the Cornelian\r\ntribe. Cicero's mother's name was Helvia, of whom we know nothing but\r\nthe one anecdote told by Quintus (_Fam._ xvi. 26), who says that she\r\nused to seal the wine jars when they were emptied, so that none might be\r\ndrained without her knowing it--a testimony to her economy and careful\r\nhousewifery. His father had weak health and resided almost entirely in\r\nhis villa at Arpinum, which he had considerably enlarged, much devoted\r\nto study and literature (_de Leg._ ii. 1). But though he apparently\r\npossessed considerable property, giving him equestrian rank, and though\r\nCicero says that his family was very ancient, yet neither he nor any of\r\nhis ancestors had held Roman magistracies. Marcus and his brother\r\nQuintus were the first of their family to do so, and both had to depend\r\non character and ability to secure their elections. But though the\r\nfather did nothing for his sons by holding curule office himself, he did\r\nthe best for their education that was possible. Cicero calls him\r\n_optimus et prudentissimus_, and speaks with gratitude of what he had\r\ndone for his sons in this respect. They were sent early to Rome to the\r\nhouse of C. Aculeo, a learned jurisconsult, married to a sister of\r\nHelvia; and attended--with their cousins, the sons of Aculeo--the best\r\nschools in the city.[2] The young Marcus shewed extraordinary ability\r\nfrom the first, and that avidity for reading and study which never\r\nforsook him. As a young man he diligently attended the chambers of\r\nrenowned jurisconsults, especially those of the elder and younger\r\nScævola, Crassus, and Antonius, and soon found that his calling in life\r\nwas oratory. It was not till he was twenty-eight years old,\r\nhowever--when he had already written much and pleaded many cases--that\r\nhe went on a visit of between two and three years to Greece, Asia, and\r\nRhodes, to study in the various schools of rhetoric and philosophy, and\r\nto view their famous cities (B.C. 79-77). It was after his return from\r\nthis tour that his age (he was now thirty-one) made the seeking of\r\noffice at Rome possible. From that time his election to the several\r\noffices--quæstorship, ædileship, prætorship, consulship--followed\r\nwithout any repulse, each in the first year of his age at which he was\r\nlegally capable of being elected.\r\n\r\nHe had doubtless made the acquaintance of Titus Pomponius, afterwards\r\ncalled Atticus, early in life. But it seems that it was their intimacy\r\nat Athens (B.C. 79), where Atticus, who was three years his senior, had\r\nbeen residing for several years, that began the very close and warm\r\nfriendship which lasted with nothing but the slightest and most passing\r\nof clouds till his death. His brother Quintus was married to Pomponia, a\r\nsister of Atticus; but the marriage turned out unfortunately, and was a\r\nstrain upon the friendship of Cicero and Atticus rather than an\r\nadditional bond. This source of uneasiness meets us in the very first\r\nletter of the correspondence, and crops up again and again till the\r\nfinal rupture of the ill-assorted union by divorce in B.C. 44. Nothing,\r\nhowever, had apparently interrupted the correspondence of the two\r\nfriends, which had been going on for a long time before the first letter\r\nwhich has been preserved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cicero the successful Advocate.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Cicero's Father.]\r\n\r\nThe eleven letters, then, which date before the consulship, shew us\r\nCicero in full career of success as an advocate and rising official,\r\nnot as yet apparently much interested in party politics, but with his\r\nmind, in the intervals of forensic business, engaged on the adornment of\r\nthe new villa at Tusculum, the first of the numerous country residences\r\nwhich his growing wealth or his heightened ideas of the dignity of his\r\nposition prompted him to purchase. Atticus is commissioned to search in\r\nAthens and elsewhere for objects of art suitable for the residence of a\r\nwealthy Roman, who at the same time was a scholar and man of letters. He\r\nis beginning to feel the charm of at any rate a temporary retreat from\r\nthe constant bustle and occupations of the city. Though Cicero loved\r\nRome, and could hardly conceive of life unconnected with its business\r\nand excitements,[3] and eagerly looked for news of the city in his\r\nabsence, yet there was another side to his character. His interest in\r\nliterature and philosophy was quite as genuine as his interest in the\r\nforum and senate-house. When the season came for temporarily withdrawing\r\nfrom the latter, he returned to the former with eager passion. But\r\nTusculum was too near Rome to secure him the quiet and solitude\r\nnecessary for study and composition. Thus, though he says (vol. i., p.\r\n4), \"I am so delighted with my Tusculan villa that I never feel really\r\nhappy till I get there,\" he often found it necessary, when engaged in\r\nany serious literary work, to seek the more complete retirement of\r\nFormiæ, Cumæ, or Pompeii, near all of which he acquired properties,\r\nbesides an inheritance at Arpinum.[4] But the important achievements in\r\nliterature were still in the future. The few letters of B.C. 68-67 are\r\nfull of directions to Atticus for the collection of books or works of\r\nart suitable to his house, and of matters of private interest. They are\r\nalso short and sometimes abrupt. The famous allusion to his father's\r\ndeath in the second letter of this collection, contained in a single\r\nline--_pater nobis decessit a.d. 111 Kal. Decembris_--followed by\r\ndirections to Atticus as to articles of _vertu_ for his villa, has much\r\nexercised the minds of admirers, who do not like to think Cicero capable\r\nof such a cold-hearted sentence. It is certainly very unlike his usual\r\nmanner.[5] He is more apt to exaggerate than understate his emotions;\r\nand in the first letter extant he speaks with real feeling of the death\r\nof a cousin. Elsewhere--as we have seen--he refers to his father with\r\nrespect and gratitude. How then are we to account for such a cold\r\nannouncement? Several expedients have been hit upon. First, to change\r\n_decessit_ to _discessit_, and to refer the sentence to the father's\r\nquitting Rome, and not life; in which case it is not easy to see why the\r\ninformation is given at all. Second, to suppose it to be a mere answer\r\nto a request for the information on the part of Atticus; in which case\r\nthe date must refer to some previous year, or the letter must be placed\r\nconsiderably later, to allow of time for Atticus to hear of the death\r\nand to write his question. In favour of the first is the fact that\r\nAsconius (§ 82) says that Cicero lost his father when he was a candidate\r\nfor the consulship (B.C. 64). Some doubt has been thrown upon the\r\ngenuineness of the passage in Asconius; and, if that is not trustworthy,\r\nwe have nothing else to help us. On the whole I think we must leave the\r\nannouncement as it stands in all its baldness. Cicero's father had long\r\nbeen an invalid, and Atticus may have been well aware that the end was\r\nexpected. He would also be acquainted with the son's feelings towards\r\nhis father, and Cicero may have held it unnecessary to enlarge upon\r\nthem. It is possible, too, that he had already written to tell Atticus\r\nof the death and of his own feelings, but had omitted the date, which he\r\nhere supplies. Whatever may be the true explanation--impossible now to\r\nrecover--everything we know of Cicero forbids us to reckon insensibility\r\namong his faults, or reserve in expressing his feelings among his\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Prætorship, B.C. 66.]\r\n\r\nIn the next year (B.C. 67) we find Cicero elected to the prætorship,\r\nafter at least two interruptions to the _comitia_, which, though not\r\naimed at himself, gave him a foretaste of the political troubles to come\r\na few years later. He is, however, at present simply annoyed at the\r\ninconvenience, not yet apprehensive of any harm to the constitution. The\r\ndouble postponement, indeed, had the effect of gratifying his vanity:\r\nfor his own name was returned three times first of the list of eight.\r\nHis prætorship (B.C. 66) passed without any startling event. The two\r\nsomewhat meagre letters which remain belonging to this year tell us\r\nhardly anything. Still he began more or less to define his political\r\nposition by advocating the _lex Manilia_, for putting the Mithridatic\r\nwar into the hands of Pompey; and one of his most elaborate forensic\r\nspeeches--that for Cluentius--was delivered in the course of the year:\r\nin which also his brother Quintus was elected to the ædileship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 65-64. Preparations for the Consulship.]\r\n\r\nSo far Cicero had risen steadily and without serious difficulty up the\r\nofficial ladder. But the stress was now to come. The old families seem\r\nnot to have been so ready to oppose the rise of the _novus homo_ to the\r\nprætorship. It was the consulship on which they tried to keep a tight\r\nhand. Accordingly, immediately after the year of his prætorship, we find\r\nhim anxiously looking out for support and inquiring who are likely to be\r\nhis competitors. The interesting point in regard to this is his\r\nconnexion with Catiline. In his speech in the senate delivered in the\r\nfollowing year (_in toga candida_, B.C. 64) he denounced Catiline in the\r\nmost violent language, accusing him of every conceivable crime; yet in\r\nB.C. 65 he not only contemplated being elected with him without any\r\nexpression of disgust, but even considered whether he should not\r\nundertake his defence on some charge that was being brought against\r\nhim--perhaps for his conduct during the Sullan proscriptions. To\r\nwhitewash Catiline is a hopeless task; and it throws a lurid light upon\r\nthe political and moral sentiments of the time to find Cicero even\r\ncontemplating such a conjunction.\r\n\r\nAfter this, for two years, there is a break in the correspondence.\r\nAtticus had probably returned to Rome, and if there were letters to\r\nothers (as no doubt there were) they have been lost. A certain light is\r\nthrown on the proceedings of the year of candidature (B.C. 64) by the\r\nessay \"On the duties of a candidate,\" ascribed to his brother Quintus,\r\nwho was himself to be a candidate for the prætorship in the next year\r\n(B.C. 63). We may see from this essay that Pompey was still regarded as\r\nthe greatest and most influential man at Rome; that Catiline's character\r\nwas so atrocious in the eyes of most, that his opposition was not to be\r\nfeared; that Cicero's \"newness\" was a really formidable bar to his\r\nelection, and that his chief support was to be looked for from the\r\nindividuals and companies for whom he had acted as counsel, and who\r\nhoped to secure his services in the future. The support of the nobles\r\nwas not a certainty. There had been a taint of _popularity_ in some of\r\nCicero's utterances, and the writer urges him to convince the consulars\r\nthat he was at one with the Optimates, while at the same time aiming at\r\nthe conciliation of the equestrian order. This was, in fact, to be\r\nCicero's political position in the future. The party of the\r\nOptimates--in spite of his disgust at the indifference and frivolity of\r\nmany of them--was to be his party: his favourite constitutional object\r\nwas to be to keep the equites and the senate on good terms: and his\r\ngreatest embarrassment was how to reconcile this position with his\r\npersonal loyalty to Pompey, and his views as to the reforms necessary in\r\nthe government of the provinces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Consulship, B.C. 63.]\r\n\r\nFor the momentous year of the consulship we have no letters. His brother\r\nQuintus was in Rome as candidate and then prætor-designate; Atticus was\r\nalso in Rome; and the business, as well as the dignity of a consul, were\r\nagainst anything like ordinary correspondence. Of the earlier part of\r\nthe consulship we have little record. The speeches against Rullus were\r\ndelivered at the beginning of the year, and commit Cicero pretty\r\ndefinitely to a policy as to the _ager publicus_--which was, to his\r\ndisgust, entirely reversed by the triumvirs in B.C. 59--but they do not\r\nshew any sense of coming trouble. Cicero, however, throughout his\r\nconsulship took a very definite line against the _populares_. Not only\r\ndid he defend Rabirius Postumus, when accused by Cæsar of the\r\nassassination of Saturninus, and address the people against offering\r\nviolence to L. Roscius on account of the unpopular _lex theatralis_,[6]\r\nbut he even resisted the restoration to their civil rights of the sons\r\nof the men proscribed by Sulla, avowedly on the ground of the necessity\r\nof maintaining the established order, though he knew and confessed the\r\njustice of the proposal.[6]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Conspiracy of Catiline.]\r\n\r\nAny movement, therefore, on the side of the popular party had now his\r\nopposition with which to reckon. He professes to have known very early\r\nin his year of office that some more than usually dangerous movement was\r\nin contemplation. We cannot well decide from the violent denunciation of\r\nCatiline contained--to judge from extant fragments--in the speech _in\r\ntoga candida_, how far Cicero was really acquainted with any definite\r\ndesigns of his. Roman orators indulged in a violence of language so\r\nalien from modern ideas and habits, that it is difficult to draw\r\ndefinite conclusions. But it appears from Sallust that Catiline had in a\r\nsecret meeting before the elections of B.C. 64, professed an intention\r\nof going all lengths in a revolutionary programme and, if that was the\r\ncase, Cicero would be sure to have had some secret information on the\r\nsubject. But his hands were partly tied by the fact that the _comitia_\r\nhad given him a colleague--C. Antonius--deeply implicated in Catiline's\r\npolicy, whatever it was. Pompey, whom he regarded as the champion of law\r\nand order, was in the East: and Catiline's candidature--and it was\r\nsupposed his policy also--had had the almost open support of the richest\r\nman in Rome, M. Licinius Crassus, and of the most influential man of the\r\n_populares_, C. Iulius Cæsar. In the house of one or the other of them,\r\nindeed, the meeting at which Catiline first unfolded his purposes was\r\nbelieved to have been held. Still Catiline had not been guilty of any\r\novert act which enabled Cicero to attack him. He had, indeed, been\r\ninformed, on very questionable authority, that Catiline had made a plot\r\nto assassinate him while holding the elections, and he made a\r\nconsiderable parade of taking precautions for his safety--letting it be\r\nseen that he wore a cuirass under his toga, and causing his house to be\r\nguarded by the younger members of his party. The elections, according\r\nto Plutarch, had at least been once postponed from the ordinary time in\r\nJuly, though this has been denied.[7] At any rate it was not till they\r\nhad taken place and Catiline had been once more rejected, that any\r\ndefinite step is alleged to have been taken by him, such as Cicero could\r\nlay hold of to attack him. On the 20th of October, in the senate, Cicero\r\nmade a speech warning the Fathers of the impending danger, and on the\r\n21st called upon Catiline for an explanation in their presence. But,\r\nafter all, even the famous meeting of the 5th of November, in the house\r\nof M. Porcius Læca, betrayed to Cicero by Fulvia, the mistress of Q.\r\nCurius, would not have sufficed as grounds for the denunciation of the\r\nfirst extant speech against Catiline (7th of November), if it had not\r\nbeen for something else. For some months past there had been rumours of\r\nrisings in various parts of Italy; but by the beginning of November it\r\nwas known that C. Manlius (or Mallius) had collected a band of\r\ndesperadoes near Fæsulæ, and, having established there a camp on the\r\n27th of October, meant to advance on Rome. Manlius had been a centurion\r\nin Sulla's army, and had received an allotment of confiscated land in\r\nEtruria; but, like others, had failed to prosper. The movement was one\r\nborn of discontent with embarrassments which were mostly brought about\r\nby extravagance or incompetence. But the rapidity with which Manlius was\r\nable to gather a formidable force round him seems to shew that there\r\nwere genuine grievances also affecting the agricultural classes in\r\nEtruria generally. At any rate there was now no doubt that a formidable\r\ndisturbance was brewing; the senate voted that there was a _tumultus_,\r\nauthorized the raising of troops, and named commanders in the several\r\ndistricts affected. It was complicity in this rising that Cicero now\r\nsought to establish against Catiline and his partisans in Rome. The\r\nreport of the meeting in the house of Læca gave him the pretext for his\r\nfirst step--a fiery denunciation of Catiline in the senate on the 7th of\r\nNovember. Catiline left Rome, joined the camp of Manlius, and assumed\r\nthe ensigns of _imperium_. That he was allowed thus to leave the city\r\nis a proof that Cicero had as yet no information enabling him to act at\r\nonce. It was the right of every citizen to avoid standing a trial by\r\ngoing into exile. Catiline was now under notice of prosecution for\r\n_vis_, and when leaving Rome he professed to be going to Marseilles,\r\nwhich had the _ius exilii_. But when it was known that he had stopped\r\nshort at Fæsulæ, the senate at once declared both him and Manlius\r\n_hostes_, and authorized the consuls to proceed against them. The\r\nexpedition was intrusted to Antonius, in spite of his known sympathy\r\nwith Catiline, while Cicero was retained with special powers to protect\r\nthe city. The result is too well known to be more than glanced at here.\r\nCatiline's partisans were detected by letters confided to certain envoys\r\nof the Allobroges, which were held to convict them of the guilt of\r\ntreason, as instigating Catiline to march on Rome, and the senate of the\r\nAllobroges to assist the invasion by sending cavalry to Fæsulæ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Execution of the conspirators, December, B.C. 63. Its legal\r\ngrounds and consequences.]\r\n\r\nThe decree of the senate, _videant consules, etc._, had come to be\r\nconsidered as reviving the full _imperium_ of the consul, and investing\r\nhim with the power of life and death over all citizens. Cicero acted on\r\nthis (questionable) constitutional doctrine. He endeavoured, indeed, to\r\nshelter himself under the authority of a senatorial vote. But the senate\r\nnever had the power to try or condemn a citizen. It could only record\r\nits advice to the consul. The whole legal responsibility for the\r\ncondemnation and death of the conspirators, arrested in consequence of\r\nthese letters, rested on the consul. To our moral judgment as to\r\nCicero's conduct it is of primary importance to determine whether or not\r\nthese men were guilty: to his legal and constitutional position it\r\nmatters not at all. Nor was that point ever raised against him. The\r\nwhole question turns on whether the doctrine was true that the _senatus\r\nconsultum ultimum_ gave the consul the right of inflicting death upon\r\ncitizens without trial, _i.e._, without appeal to the people, on the\r\nanalogy of the dictator _seditionis sedandæ causa_, thus practically\r\ndefeating that most ancient and cherished safeguard of Roman liberty,\r\nthe _ius provocationis_. The precedents were few, and scarcely such as\r\nwould appeal to popular approval. The murder of Tiberius Gracchus had\r\nbeen _ex post facto_ approved by the senate in B.C. 133-2. In the case\r\nof Gaius Gracchus, in B.C. 121, the senate had voted _uti consul Opimius\r\nrempublicam defenderet_, and in virtue of that the consul had authorized\r\nthe killing of Gaius and his friends: thus for the first time exercising\r\n_imperium sine provocatione_. Opimius had been impeached after his year\r\nof office, but acquitted, which the senate might claim as a confirmation\r\nof the right, in spite of the _lex_ of Gaius Gracchus, which confirmed\r\nthe right of _provocatio_ in all cases. In B.C. 100 the tribune\r\nSaturninus and the prætor Glaucia were arrested in consequence of a\r\nsimilar decree, which this time joined the other magistrates to the\r\nconsuls as authorized to protect the Republic: their death, however, was\r\nan act of violence on the part of a mob. Its legality had been impugned\r\nby Cæsar's condemnation of Rabirius, as _duovir capitalis_, but to a\r\ncertain extent confirmed by the failure to secure his conviction on the\r\ntrial of his appeal to the people. In B.C. 88 and 83 this decree of the\r\nsenate was again passed, in the first case in favour of Sulla against\r\nthe tribune Sulpicius, who was in consequence put to death; and in the\r\nsecond case in favour of the consuls (partisans of Marius) against the\r\nfollowers of Sulla. Again in B.C. 77 the decree was passed in\r\nconsequence of the insurrection of the proconsul Lepidus, who, however,\r\nescaped to Sardinia and died there.\r\n\r\nIn every case but one this decree had been passed against the popular\r\nparty. The only legal sanction given to the exercise of the _imperium\r\nsine provocatione_ was the acquittal of the consul Opimius in B.C. 120.\r\nBut the jury which tried that case probably consisted entirely of\r\nsenators, who would not stultify their own proceedings by condemning\r\nhim. To rely upon such precedents required either great boldness (never\r\na characteristic of Cicero), or the most profound conviction of the\r\nessential righteousness of the measure, and the clearest assurance that\r\nthe safety of the state--the supreme law--justified the breach of every\r\nconstitutional principle. Cicero was not left long in doubt as to\r\nwhether there would be any to question his proceeding. On the last day\r\nof the year, when about to address the people, as was customary, on\r\nlaying down his consulship, the tribune Q. Cæcilius Metellus Nepos\r\nforbade him to speak, on the express ground that he \"had put citizens to\r\ndeath uncondemned\"--_quod cives indemnatos necavisset_. Cicero consoled\r\nhimself with taking the required oath as to having observed the laws,\r\nwith an additional declaration that he had \"saved the state.\"\r\nNevertheless, he must have felt deeply annoyed and alarmed at the action\r\nof Metellus, for he had been a _legatus_ of Pompey, and was supposed to\r\nrepresent his views, and it was upon the approbation and support of\r\nPompey, now on the eve of his return from the East, that Cicero\r\nparticularly reckoned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letters after B.C. 63.]\r\n\r\nThe letters in our collection now recommence. The first of the year\r\n(B.C. 62) is one addressed to Pompey, expressing some discontent at the\r\nqualified manner in which he had written on recent events, and affirming\r\nhis own conviction that he had acted in the best interests of the state\r\nand with universal approval. But indeed the whole correspondence to the\r\nend of Cicero's exile is permeated with this subject directly or\r\nindirectly. His quarrel with Metellus Nepos brought upon him a\r\nremonstrance from the latter's brother (or cousin), Metellus Celer\r\n(Letters XIII, XIV), and when the correspondence for B.C. 61 opens, we\r\nfind him already on the eve of the quarrel with Publius Clodius which\r\nwas to bring upon him the exile of B.C. 58.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Publius Clodius Pulcher.]\r\n\r\nP. CLODIUS PULCHER was an extreme instance of a character not uncommon\r\namong the nobility in the last age of the Republic. Of high birth, and\r\npossessed of no small amount of ability and energy, he belonged by\r\norigin and connexion to the Optimates; but he regarded politics as a\r\ngame to be played for his personal aggrandizement, and public office as\r\na means of replenishing a purse drained by boundless extravagance and\r\nself-indulgence. His record had been bad. He had accompanied his\r\nbrother-in-law Lucullus, or had joined his staff, in the war with\r\nMithridates, and had helped to excite a mutiny in his army in revenge\r\nfor some fancied slight. He had then gone to Cilicia, where another\r\nbrother-in-law, Q. Marcus Rex, was proprætor, and while commanding a\r\nfleet under him had fallen into the hands of pirates, and when freed\r\nfrom them had gone--apparently in a private capacity--to Antioch, where\r\nhe again excited a mutiny of Syrian troops engaged in a war against the\r\nArabians (B.C. 70-65). On his return to Rome he attempted to make\r\nhimself conspicuous by prosecuting Catiline, but accepted a bribe to\r\nwithdraw. In B.C. 64, on the staff of the governor of Gallia\r\nNarbonensis, he is accused of having enriched himself with plunder. For\r\na time after that he was still acting as a member of the party of the\r\nOptimates; seems to have supported Cicero during the Catiline\r\nconspiracy; and in B.C. 62 stood for the quæstorship and was elected.\r\nHis violation of the mysteries was alleged to have been committed in\r\nDecember of that year, and before he could go to the province allotted\r\nto him as quæstor in Sicily he had to stand a trial for sacrilege. Such\r\nan offence--penetrating in disguise into the house of the Pontifex\r\nMaximus, when his wife was engaged in the secret rites of the Bona\r\nDea--would place him under a curse, and not only prevent his entering\r\nupon his quæstorship, but would disfranchise and politically ruin him.\r\nClodius would seem not to have been a person of sufficient character or\r\nimportance to make this trial a political event. But not only had he\r\npowerful backers, but his opponents also, by proposing an innovation in\r\nthe manner of selecting the jurors for trying him, had managed to give a\r\nspurious political importance to the case. One of the most brilliant of\r\nthe early letters (XV, p. 37) gives us a graphic picture of the trial.\r\nClodius was acquitted and went to his province, but returned in B.C. 60,\r\napparently prepared for a change of parties. Cicero and he had\r\nquarrelled over the trial. He had said sarcastic things about the sacred\r\nconsulship, and Cicero had retaliated by bitter speeches in the senate,\r\nand by giving evidence at the trial of having seen Clodius in Rome three\r\nhours before he professed to have been at Interamna, on the day of the\r\nalleged sacrilege. It is perhaps possible that his alibi may have been\r\ntrue in substance, for he may have been well out of Rome on his way to\r\nInteramna after seeing Cicero. But, however that may be, he nourished a\r\ngrudge against Cicero, which he presently had an opportunity of\r\nsatisfying. The year of his return to Rome from Sicily (B.C. 60) was the\r\nsame as that of Cæsar's return from Spain. Pompey--who had returned the\r\nyear before--was at enmity with the senate on account of the\r\ndifficulties raised to the confirmation of his _acta_ and the allotments\r\nfor his veterans. Cæsar had a grievance because of the difficulties put\r\nin the way of his triumph. The two coalesced, taking in the millionaire\r\nCrassus, to form a triumvirate or coalition of three, with a view to\r\ngetting measures they desired passed, and offices for themselves or\r\ntheir partisans. This was a great blow to Cicero, who clung feverously\r\nto Pompey as a political leader, but could not follow him in a coalition\r\nwith Cæsar: for he knew that the object of it was a series of measures\r\nof which he heartily disapproved. His hope of seeing Pompey coming to\r\nact as acknowledged leader of the Optimates was dashed to the ground. He\r\ncould not make up his mind wholly to abandon him, or, on the other hand,\r\nto cut himself adrift from the party of Optimates, to whose policy he\r\nhad so deeply committed himself. Clodius was troubled by no such\r\nscruples. Perhaps Cæsar had given him substantial reasons for his change\r\nof policy. At any rate, from this time forward he acts as an extreme\r\n_popularis_--much too extreme, as it turned out, for Pompey's taste. As\r\na patrician his next step in the official ladder would naturally have\r\nbeen the ædileship. But that peaceful office did not suit his present\r\npurpose. The tribuneship would give him the right to bring forward\r\nmeasures in the _comitia tributa_, such as he desired to pass, and would\r\nin particular give him the opportunity of attacking Cicero. The\r\ndifficulty was that to become tribune he must cease to be a patrician.\r\nHe could only do that by being adopted into a plebeian gens. He had a\r\nplebeian ready to do it in B.C. 59. But for a man who was _sui iuris_ to\r\nbe adopted required a formal meeting of the old _comitia curiata_, and\r\nsuch a meeting required the presence of an augur, as well as some kind\r\nof sanction of the pontifices. Cæsar was Pontifex Maximus, and Pompey\r\nwas a member of the college of augurs. Their influence would be\r\nsufficient to secure or prevent this being done. Their consent was, it\r\nappears, for a time withheld. But Cæsar was going to Gaul at the end of\r\nhis consulship, and desired to have as few powerful enemies at Rome\r\nduring his absence as possible. Still he had a personal feeling for\r\nCicero, and when it was known that one of Clodius's objects in seeking\r\nto become a plebeian and a tribune was to attack him, Cæsar offered him\r\ntwo chances of honourable retreat--first as one of the commissioners to\r\nadminister his land law, and again as one of his _legati_ in Gaul. But\r\nCicero would not accept the first, because he was vehemently opposed to\r\nthe law itself: nor the second, because he had no taste for provincial\r\nbusiness, even supposing the proconsul to be to his liking; and because\r\nhe could not believe that P. Clodius would venture to attack him, or\r\nwould succeed if he did. Cæsar's consulship of B.C. 59 roused his worst\r\nfears for the Republic; and, though he thought little of the\r\nstatesmanship or good sense of Cæsar's hostile colleague Bibulus, he was\r\nthoroughly disgusted with the policy of the triumvirs, with the\r\ncontemptuous treatment of the senate, with the high-handed disregard of\r\nthe auspices--by means of which Bibulus tried to invalidate the laws and\r\nother _acta_ of Cæsar--and with the armed forces which Pompey brought\r\ninto the _campus_, nominally to keep order, but really to overawe the\r\n_comitia_, and secure the passing of Cæsar's laws. Nor was it in his\r\nnature to conceal his feelings. Speaking early in the year in defence of\r\nhis former colleague, C. Antonius, accused of _maiestas_ for his conduct\r\nin Macedonia, he expressed in no doubtful terms his view of the\r\npolitical situation. Within a few hours the words were reported to the\r\ntriumvirs, and all formalities were promptly gone through for the\r\nadoption of Clodius. Cæsar himself presided at the _comitia curiata_,\r\nPompey attended as augur, and the thing was done in a few minutes. Even\r\nthen Cicero does not appear to have been alarmed, or to have been fully\r\naware of what the object of Publius was. While on his usual spring visit\r\nto his seaside villas in April (B.C. 59), he expressed surprise at\r\nhearing from the young Curio that Clodius was a candidate for the\r\ntribuneship (vol. i., p. 99). His surprise no doubt was more or less\r\nassumed: he must have understood that Clodius's object in the adoption\r\nwas the tribunate, and must have had many uneasy reflexions as to the\r\nuse which he would make of the office when he got it. Indeed there was\r\nnot very much doubt about it, for Publius openly avowed his intentions.\r\nWe have accordingly numerous references, in the letters to Atticus, to\r\nCicero's doubts about the course he ought to adopt. Should he accept\r\nCæsar's offer of a legation in Gaul, or a free and votive legation?\r\nShould he stay in Rome and fight it out? The latter course was the one\r\non which he was still resolved in July, when Clodius had been, or was on\r\nthe point of being, elected tribune (p. 110). He afterwards wavered (p.\r\n113), but was encouraged by the belief that all the \"orders\" were\r\nfavourable to him, and were becoming alienated from the triumvirs (pp.\r\n117, 119), especially after the affair of Vettius (pp. 122-124), and by\r\nthe friendly disposition of many of the colleagues of Clodius in the\r\ntribuneship. With such feelings of confidence and courage the letters of\r\nB.C. 59 come to an end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Exile, April, B.C. 58--August, B.C. 57.]\r\n\r\nThe correspondence only opens again in April of B.C. 58, when the worst\r\nhas happened. Clodius entered upon his tribuneship on the 10th of\r\nDecember, B.C. 59, and lost little time in proposing a law to the\r\n_comitia_ for the trial of any magistrate guilty of putting citizens to\r\ndeath without trial (_qui cives indemnatos necavisset_). The wording of\r\nthe law thus left it open to plead that it applied only to such act as\r\noccurred after its enactment, for the pluperfect _necavisset_ in the\r\ndependent clause answers to the future perfect in a direct one. And this\r\nwas the interpretation that Cæsar, while approving the law itself,\r\ndesired to put upon it.[8] He again offered Cicero a legation in Gaul,\r\nbut would do nothing for him if he stayed in Rome; while Pompey, who had\r\nbeen profuse in promises of protection, either avoided seeing Cicero, or\r\ntreated his abject entreaties with cold disdain.[9] Every citizen, by a\r\nhumane custom at Rome, had the right of avoiding a prosecution by\r\nquitting the city and residing in some town which had the _ius exilii_.\r\nIt is this course that we find Cicero already entered upon when the\r\ncorrespondence of the year begins. In the letters of this year of exile\r\nhe continually reproaches himself with not having stayed and even\r\nsupported the law, in full confidence that it could not be applied to\r\nhimself. He attributes his having taken the less courageous course to\r\nthe advice of his friends, who were actuated by jealousy and a desire\r\nto get rid of him. Even Atticus he thinks was timid, at the best, in\r\nadvising his retirement. It is the only occasion in all the\r\ncorrespondence in which the least cloud seems to have rested on the\r\nperfect friendship of the two men. Atticus does not appear to have shewn\r\nany annoyance at the querulous remarks of his friend. He steadily\r\ncontinued to write, giving information and advice, and made no\r\ndifficulty in supplying his friend with money. During Cicero's absence\r\nAtticus became still more wealthy than before by inheriting the estates\r\nof his cross-grained uncle Cæcilius. But he was always careful as to the\r\ninvestment of his money and he would not, perhaps, have been so ready to\r\ntrust Cicero, had he not felt confidence in the ultimate recovery of his\r\ncivil status. Still his confidence was peculiarly welcome at a time\r\nwhich would have been otherwise one of great pressure. For Clodius had\r\nfollowed up Cicero's retirement with the usual _lex_ in regard to\r\npersons leaving Rome to avoid a trial--a prohibition \"of fire and water\"\r\nwithin a fixed distance from Italy, which involved the confiscation of\r\nall his property in Italy. His villas were dismantled, his town house\r\npulled down, and a vote of the people obtained by Clodius for the\r\nconsecration of its site as a _templum_ dedicated to Liberty, and a\r\nscheme was formed and the work actually commenced for occupying part of\r\nit by an extension of an existing porticus or colonnade (the _porticus\r\nCatuli_) to contain a statue of Liberty. That this consecration was\r\nregular is shewn by the pleas by which it was afterwards sought to\r\nreverse it.[10] When Cicero was recalled the question came before the\r\npontifices, who decided that the consecration was not valid unless it\r\nhad been done by the \"order of the people.\" It could not be denied on\r\nthe face of it that there had been such an order. Cicero was obliged to\r\nresort to the plea that Clodius's adoption had been irregular and\r\ninvalid, that therefore he was not legally a tribune, and could not take\r\nan order of the people. Finally, the senate seems to have decided that\r\nits restoration to Cicero was part of the general _restitutio in\r\nintegrum_ voted by the _comitia centuriata_; and a sum of money was\r\nassigned to him for the rebuilding of the house. Clodius refused to\r\nrecognize the validity of this decree of the senate, and attempted by\r\nviolence to interrupt the workmen engaged on the house. We have a lively\r\npicture of this in Letter XCI (vol. i., pp. 194-196).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letters of the Exile (Letters LV-LXXXVIII).]\r\n\r\nThe letters from Cicero as an exile are painful reading for those who\r\nentertain a regard for his character. It was not unnatural, indeed, that\r\nhe should feel it grievously. He had so completely convinced himself of\r\nthe extraordinary value of his services to the state, of the importance\r\nof his position in Roman politics, and of the view that the Optimates\r\nwould take of the necessity of retaining him, that to see himself\r\ntreated like a fraudulent or unsuccessful provincial governor, of no\r\nimportance to anyone but himself, was a bitter blow to his self-esteem.\r\nThe actual loss was immense. His only means were now the amount of money\r\nhe had been able to take with him, or was able to borrow. All was gone\r\nexcept such property as his wife retained in her own right. He was a\r\ndependent upon her, instead of being her support and the master of his\r\nown household. The services of freedmen--readily rendered when he was\r\nprosperous--would now be a matter of favour and personal attachment,\r\nwhich was not always sufficient to retain them. The \"life and light\" of\r\nthe city, in which no man ever took a more eager interest and delight,\r\nwere closed to him. He was cut off from his family, and from familiar\r\nintercourse with friends, on both of which he was much dependent for\r\npersonal happiness. Lastly, wherever he lived, he lived, as it were, on\r\nsufferance, no longer an object of respect as a statesman, or the source\r\nof help to others by his eloquence. But, disagreeable as all this was to\r\na man of Cicero's sensitive vanity, there was something still worse.\r\nEven in towns which were the legal distance from Italy he could not\r\nsafely stay, if they were within the jurisdiction of one of his personal\r\nenemies, or contained other exiles, who owed him an ill turn. He was\r\nprotected by no law, and more than one instance of such a man's falling\r\na victim to an enemy's dagger is recorded. Cicero's first idea was to go\r\nto Malta: but Malta was for some purposes in the jurisdiction of the\r\ngovernor of Sicily, and the governor of Sicily (C. Vergilius[11])\r\nobjected to his passing through Sicily or staying at Malta. We have no\r\nreason for supposing Vergilius personally hostile to Cicero, but he may\r\nhave thought that Cicero's services to the Sicilians in the case of\r\nVerres would have called out some expression of feeling on their part in\r\nhis favour, which would have been awkward for a Roman governor. Cicero\r\ntherefore crossed to Epirus, and travelled down the Egnatian road to\r\nThessalonica. This was the official capital of the province of\r\nMacedonia, and the quæstor in Macedonia, Gnæus Plancius, met Cicero at\r\nDyrrachium, invited him to fix his residence there with him, and\r\naccompanied him on his journey. Here he stayed till November in a state\r\nof anxiety and distress, faithfully reflected in his letters, waiting to\r\nhear how far the elections for B.C. 57 would result in putting his\r\nfriends in office, and watching for any political changes that would\r\nfavour his recall: but prepared to go still farther to Cyzicus, if the\r\nincoming governor, L. Calpurnius Piso, who, as consul in B.C. 58 with\r\nGabinius, had shewn decided animus against him, should still retain that\r\nfeeling in Macedonia. Events, however, in Rome during the summer and\r\nautumn of B.C. 58 gave him better hopes. Clodius, by his violent\r\nproceedings, as well as by his legislation, had alienated Pompey, and\r\ncaused him to favour Cicero's recall. Of the new consuls Lentulus was\r\nhis friend, and Q. Cæcilius Metellus Nepos (who as tribune in B.C. 63-62\r\nhad prevented his speech when laying down his consulship) consented to\r\nwaive all opposition. A majority of the new tribunes were also\r\nfavourable to him, especially P. Sestius and T. Annius Milo; and in\r\nspite of constant ups and downs in his feelings of confidence, he had on\r\nthe whole concluded that his recall was certain to take place. Towards\r\nthe end of November he therefore travelled back to Dyrrachium, a _libera\r\ncivitas_ in which he had many friends, and where he thought he might be\r\nsafe, and from which he could cross to Italy as soon as he heard of the\r\nlaw for his recall having been passed. Here, however, he was kept\r\nwaiting through many months of anxiety. Clodius had managed to make his\r\nrecall as difficult as possible. He had, while tribune, obtained an\r\norder from the people forbidding the consuls to bring the subject before\r\nthe senate, and Piso and Gabinius had during their year of office\r\npleaded that law as a bar to introducing the question.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Recall, August, B.C. 57.]\r\n\r\nThe new consuls were not, or did not consider themselves, so bound, and\r\nLentulus having brought the subject forward, the senate early passed a\r\nresolution that Cicero's recall was to take precedence of all other\r\nbusiness. In accordance with the resolution of the senate, a law was\r\nproposed by the consul Lentulus in the _comitia centuriata_, and\r\nprobably one by Milo to the _tributa_. But Clodius, though no longer\r\narmed with the tribuneship, was not yet beaten. He obtained the aid of\r\nsome gladiators belonging to his brother Appius, and more than once\r\ninterrupted and dispersed an assembly of the _comitia_. In the riots\r\nthus occasioned blood was shed on both sides, and Cicero's brother\r\nQuintus on one occasion nearly lost his life. This was the beginning of\r\nthe series of violent contests between Clodius and Milo, only ended by\r\nthe murder of the former on the Appian road in B.C. 52. But Clodius was\r\na candidate for the ædileship in this year (B.C. 57), and could be\r\nbarred from that office legally by a prosecution for _vis_, of which\r\nMilo gave notice against him. It was, perhaps, a desire to avoid this,\r\nas much as fear of Milo's counter exhibition of violence, that at length\r\ncaused him to relax in his opposition, or at any rate to abstain from\r\nviolently interrupting the _comitia_. Accordingly, on the 4th of August,\r\nthe law proposed by both consuls, and supported by Pompey, was passed\r\nunanimously by the centuries. Cicero, we must presume, had received\r\ntrustworthy information that this was to be the case (shewing that some\r\nunderstanding had been come to with Clodius, or there would have been no\r\ncertainty of his not violently dispersing the _comitia_ again), for on\r\nthat same day he set sail from Dyrrachium and landed at Brundisium on\r\nthe 5th. His triumphant return to Rome is described in the eighty-ninth\r\nletter of this collection. For Pompey's share in securing it he\r\nexpressed, and seems really to have felt, an exaggerated gratitude,\r\nwhich still influenced him in the unhappy months of B.C. 49, when he was\r\nhesitating as to joining him beyond seas in the civil war.\r\n\r\nBut though Clodius had somehow been prevented from hindering his recall,\r\nhe by no means relaxed his hostility. He not only tried to excite the\r\npopulace against him by arguing that the scarcity and consequent high\r\nprice of corn, from which the people were at that time suffering, was in\r\nsome way attributable to Cicero's policy, but he also opposed the\r\nrestoration of his house; and when a decree of the senate was passed in\r\nCicero's favour on that point, brought his armed ruffians to prevent the\r\nworkmen from going on with the rebuilding, as well as to molest Cicero\r\nhimself (vol. i., p. 195). This was followed by a determined opposition\r\nby Milo to the holding of the elections for B.C. 56, until his\r\nprosecution of Clodius _de vi_ should have been tried. Clodius, however,\r\nwas acquitted,[12] and, being elected ædile, immediately commenced a\r\ncounter accusation against Milo for _vis_. He impeached him before the\r\n_comitia_ in February (B.C. 56), on which occasion Pompey spoke in\r\nMilo's defence in the midst of a storm of interruptions got up by the\r\nfriends of Clodius (vol. i., pp. 214, 217). Milo was also acquitted, and\r\nthe rest of Clodius's ædileship seems to have passed without farther\r\nacts of open violence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cicero and the Triumvirs.]\r\n\r\nBut Cicero had now other causes of anxiety. He had spoken in favour of\r\nthe commission offered to Pompey in B.C. 57 for superintending the\r\ncorn-supply of Rome (_cura annonæ_). Pompey was to have fifteen legates,\r\na good supply of ships and men, and considerable powers in all\r\ncorn-growing countries in the Mediterranean. Cicero supported this,\r\npartly from gratitude to Pompey, but partly also from a wish to promote\r\nhis power and influence against the ever-increasing influence and fame\r\nof Cæsar. He secretly hoped that a jealousy might grow up between them;\r\nthat Pompey would be drawn closer to the Optimates; and that the union\r\nof the triumvirate might be gradually weakened and finally disappear.\r\nPompey was thoroughly offended and alarmed by the insults offered him by\r\nthe Clodian mob, and by Clodius's own denunciations of him; and if he\r\ncould be convinced that these were suggested or approved by Cæsar or\r\nCrassus, it would go far to withdraw him from friendship with either of\r\nthem. With Crassus, indeed, he had never been on cordial terms: it was\r\nonly Cæsar's influence that had caused him to form any union with him.\r\nCæsar, on the other hand, was likely to be uneasy at the great powers\r\nwhich the _cura annonæ_ put into Pompey's hands; and at the possible\r\nsuggestion of offering him the dictatorship, if the Clodian riots became\r\nquite intolerable. On the whole, Cicero thought that he saw the element\r\nof a very pretty quarrel, from which he hoped that the result might be\r\n\"liberty\"--the orderly working of the constitution, that is, without the\r\nirregular supremacy of anyone, at any rate of anyone of the popular\r\nparty. He had, however, a delicate part to play. He did not wish or dare\r\nto break openly with Cæsar, or to speak too openly to Pompey; and he was\r\nconscious that the intemperance, folly, or indifference of many of the\r\nOptimates made it difficult to reckon on their support, and made that\r\nsupport a very questionable benefit if accorded. But though his letters\r\nof this period are full of expressions indicating doubt of Pompey and\r\nirritation with him, yet he seems still to have spoken of him with\r\nwarmth on public occasions, while he avoided mentioning Cæsar, or spoke\r\nof him only in cold terms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Renewal of the Triumvirate at Luca, April, B.C. 56, and\r\nCicero's change of policy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quintus Cicero in Gaul.]\r\n\r\nThe hope, however, of detaching Pompey from Cæsar was dashed by the\r\nmeeting at Luca in April, B.C. 56, at which a fresh arrangement was made\r\nfor the mutual advantage of the triumvirs. Cæsar got the promise of the\r\nintroduction of a law giving him an additional five years of command in\r\nGaul, with special privileges as to his candidature for the consulship\r\nof B.C. 48; while Pompey and Crassus bargained for a second consulship\r\nin B.C. 55, and the reversion of the Spains (to be held as a single\r\nprovince) and Syria respectively, each for five years. The care taken\r\nthat none of the three should have _imperium_ overlapping that of the\r\nothers was indeed a sign of mutual distrust and jealousy. But the\r\nbargain was made with sufficient approval of the members of the party\r\ncrowding Luca to secure its being carried out by the _comitia_. The\r\nunion seemed stronger than ever; and Cicero at length resolved on a\r\ngreat change of attitude. Opposition to the triumvirs had been\r\nabandoned, he saw, by the very party for whom he had been incurring the\r\nenmity of Pompey and Cæsar. Why should he hold out any longer? \"Since\r\nthose who have no power,\" he writes to Atticus in April, \"refuse me\r\ntheir affection, let me take care to secure the affection of those who\r\nhave power. You will say, 'I could have wished that you had done so\r\nbefore.' I know you did wish it, and that I have made a real ass of\r\nmyself.\"[13] This is the first indication in the letters of the change.\r\nBut it was soon to be publicly avowed. The opposition to the consulship\r\nof Pompey and Crassus was so violent that no election took place during\r\nB.C. 56, and they were only elected under the presidency of _interreges_\r\nat the beginning of February, B.C. 55. But by the _lex Sempronia_ the\r\nsenate was bound to name the consular provinces--_i.e._, the provinces\r\nto be governed by the incoming consuls after their year of\r\noffice--before the elections, and in his speech on the subject (_de\r\nProvinciis Consularibus_), delivered apparently in July, B.C. 56,\r\nCicero, while urging that Piso and Gabinius should have successors\r\nappointed to them in Macedonia and Syria, took occasion to announce and\r\ndefend his own reconciliation with Cæsar, and to support his continuance\r\nin the governorship of Gaul. Shortly afterwards, when defending the\r\ncitizenship of L. Cornelius Balbus, he delivered a glowing panegyric on\r\nPompey's character and services to the state. This was followed by a\r\ncomplete abstention from any farther opposition to the carrying out of\r\nCæsar's law for the allotment of the Campanian land--a subject which he\r\nhad himself brought before the senate only a short time before, and on\r\nwhich he really continued to feel strongly.[14] Cicero's most elaborate\r\ndefence of his change of front is contained in a long letter to P.\r\nLentulus Spinther, written two years afterwards.[15] The gist of it is\r\nmuch the same as the remark to Atticus already quoted. \"Pompey and\r\nCæsar were all-powerful, and could not be resisted without civil\r\nviolence, if not downright civil war. The Optimates were feeble and\r\nshifty, had shewn ingratitude to Cicero himself, and had openly favoured\r\nhis enemy Clodius. Public peace and safety must be the statesman's chief\r\nobject, and almost any concession was to be preferred to endangering\r\nthese.\" Nevertheless, we cannot think that Cicero was ever heartily\r\nreconciled to the policy, or the unconstitutional preponderance of the\r\ntriumvirs. He patched up some sort of reconciliation with Crassus, and\r\nhis personal affection for Pompey made it comparatively easy for him to\r\ngive him a kind of support. Cæsar was away, and a correspondence filled\r\non both sides with courteous expressions could be maintained without\r\nseriously compromising his convictions. But Cicero was never easy under\r\nthe yoke. From B.C. 55 to B.C. 52 he sought several opportunities for a\r\nprolonged stay in the country, devoting himself--in default of\r\npolitics--to literature. The fruits of this were the _de Oratore_ and\r\nthe _de Republica_, besides poems on his own times and on his\r\nconsulship. Still he was obliged from time to time to appear in the\r\nforum and senate-house, and in various ways to gratify Pompey and Cæsar.\r\nIt must have been a great strain upon his loyalty to this new political\r\nfriendship when, in B.C. 54, Pompey called upon him to undertake the\r\ndefence of P. Vatinius, whom he had not long before attacked so fiercely\r\nwhile defending Sestius. Vatinius had been a tribune in B.C. 59, acting\r\nentirely in Cæsar's interests, and Cicero believed him to have been his\r\nenemy both in the matter of his exile and in the opposition to his\r\nrecall. He had denounced him in terms that would have made it almost\r\nimpossible, one would think, to have spoken in his defence in any cause\r\nwhatever. At best he represented all that Cicero most disliked in\r\npolitics; and on this very election, to the prætorship, for which he was\r\ncharged with bribery (_de sodalitiis_), Cicero had already spoken in\r\nstrongly hostile terms in the senate. For now undertaking his defence he\r\nhas, in fact, no explanation to give to Lentulus (vol. i., p. 319), and\r\nhe was long sore at having been forced to do it. Through B.C. 54 and 53\r\nhe was busied with his _de Republica_, and was kept more in touch with\r\nCæsar by the fact that his brother Quintus was serving as _legatus_ to\r\nthe latter in Britain and Gaul, and that his friend Trebatius\r\n(introduced by himself) was seeking for promotion and profit in Cæsar's\r\ncamp. But even his brother's service with Cæsar did not eventually\r\ncontribute to the formation of cordial feeling on his part towards\r\nCæsar, whom he could not help admiring, but never really liked. For\r\nQuintus, though he distinguished himself by his defence of his camp in\r\nthe autumn of B.C. 54, lost credit and subjected himself to grave rebuke\r\nby the disaster incurred in B.C. 53, near Aduatuca (_Tongres_), brought\r\nabout by disregarding an express order of Cæsar's. There is no allusion\r\nto this in the extant correspondence, but a fragment of letter from\r\nCæsar to Cicero (_neque pro cauto ac diligente se castris\r\ncontinuit_[16]), seems to shew that Cæsar had written sharply to Cicero\r\non his brother's _faux pas_, and after this time, though Cicero met\r\nCæsar at Ravenna in B.C. 52, and consented to support the bill allowing\r\nhim to stand for the consulship in his absence,[17] there is apparent in\r\nhis references to him a return to the cold or critical tone of former\r\ntimes. But of course there were other reasons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pompey's third Consulship and the trial of Milo, B.C. 52.]\r\n\r\nPompey's six months' sole consulship of B.C. 52 (\"that divine third\r\nconsulship\"), the rumour of his dictatorship, and the growing\r\ndetermination of the Optimates to play off Pompey against Cæsar (Crassus\r\nhaving disappeared) and to insist on Cæsar resigning his province and\r\narmy before the end of his ten years' tenure, and before standing for a\r\nsecond consulship, caused Cicero's hope of a final dissolution of the\r\nunconstitutional compact to revive again; and made him draw more and\r\nmore closely to Pompey as the chief hope of the _boni_. In the beginning\r\nof the year he had found himself in opposition, or quasi-opposition, to\r\nPompey in regard to the prosecution of Milo for the murder of Clodius.\r\nBut though in the previous year he had declared that the election of\r\nMilo to the consulship was of the utmost importance to his own position\r\nand the safety of the state,[18] now that it was rendered impossible by\r\nMilo's condemnation, he seems to have placed all his hopes on Pompey.\r\nUnfortunately, there is here a break in the correspondence. There is no\r\nletter of the last six months of B.C. 53, and only four (perhaps only\r\nthree) of B.C. 52.[19] So that the riots which prevented Milo's\r\nelection, the death of Clodius and the riots following it, and the\r\nconsequent sole consulship of Pompey, with the latter's new legislation\r\nand the trial of Milo--all have to be sought for elsewhere. The last\r\nletter of this volume and of this year, addressed to M. Marius in\r\nDecember, B.C. 52, alludes to the condemnation of Milo, and to the\r\nnumerous prosecutions following it. \"Here, in Rome, I am so distracted\r\nby the number of trials, the crowded courts, and the new legislation,\r\nthat I daily offer prayers that there may be no intercalation.\"[20]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cicero appointed Proconsul of Cilicia, B.C. 51-50.]\r\n\r\nWhen the correspondence opens again in the spring of B.C. 51 an event\r\nhas happened, of no particular importance in itself, but of supreme\r\ninterest to Cicero, and very fortunate for the readers of the\r\ncorrespondence. One of Pompey's new laws ordained that no one was to\r\ntake a province till the fifth year after laying down his consulship or\r\nprætorship. Pompey broke his own law by keeping his province, the\r\nSpains--his position in regard to them was altogether exceptional--but,\r\nin order to carry out the law in other cases, the senate arranged that\r\nex-consuls and ex-prætors who had not been to provinces should in turn\r\ndraw lots for vacant governorships. Cicero and Bibulus appear to have\r\nbeen the senior _consulares_ in that position, and with much reluctance\r\nCicero allowed his name to be cast into the urn. He drew Cilicia and\r\nBibulus Syria. He says that his motive was a desire to obey the wishes\r\nof the senate. Another motive may have been a desire to be away from\r\nRome while the controversy as to Cæsar's retirement from his province\r\nwas settled, and to retrieve a position of some political importance,\r\nwhich he had certainly not increased during the last few years. When it\r\ncame to the actual start, however, he felt all the _gêne_ of the\r\nbusiness--the formation and control of his staff, the separation from\r\nfriends, and the residence far from the \"light and life\" of Rome, among\r\nofficials who were certainly commonplace and probably corrupt, and\r\namidst a population, perhaps acute and accomplished, but certainly\r\nservile and ill content, and in some parts predatory and barbarous. At\r\nthe best, they would be emphatically provincial, in a dreary sense of\r\nthe word. He felt unequal to the worry and bore of the whole business,\r\nand reproached himself with the folly of the undertaking. Of course,\r\nthis regret is mingled with his usual self-congratulation on the purity\r\nwith which he means to manage his province. But even that feeling is not\r\nstrong enough to prevent his longing earnestly to have the period of\r\nbanishment as short as possible, or to prevent the alarm with which he\r\nhears of a probable invasion by the Parthians. One effect of his almost\r\ntwo years' absence from Rome was, I think, to deprive him of the power\r\nof judging clearly of the course of events. He had constant intelligence\r\nand excellent correspondents--especially Cælius--still he could not\r\nreally grasp what was going on under the surface: and when he returned\r\nto find the civil war on the point of breaking out, he was, after all,\r\ntaken by surprise, and had no plan of action ready. This, as well as his\r\ngovernment of the province, will be fully illustrated in the next volume\r\nof the correspondence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cicero's Correspondents.]\r\n\r\nThe persons to whom the chief letters are addressed in this volume,\r\nbesides Atticus, are Cicero's brother Quintus and P. Lentulus Spinther.\r\nThere are two excellent letters to M. Marius, and one very interesting,\r\nthough rather surprising, epistle to L. Lucceius. Others of more than\r\naverage interest are to Terentia, M. Fadius Gallus, C. Scribonius Curio,\r\nand Tiro.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Titus Pomponius Atticus.]\r\n\r\nATTICUS (B.C. 109-32) is a man of whom we should be glad to know more\r\nthan we do. He was the friend of all the leading men of the day--Pompey,\r\nCæsar, Cicero, Antony, Brutus--father-in-law of Agrippa, and survived to\r\nbe a constant correspondent of Augustus, between B.C. 43 and his death\r\nin B.C. 32. He was spared and respected by both sides in the civil\r\nwars, from Sulla to the Second Triumvirate. The secret of his success\r\nseems to have been that he was no man's rival. He resolutely declined\r\nall official employment, even on the staff of his brother-in-law Quintus\r\nCicero. He committed himself to no side in politics, and, not being in\r\nthe senate, had no occasion by vote or speech to wound the feelings of\r\nanyone. So, too, though he cared for literature, it was rather as a\r\nfriendly critic of others than as an author. He did, it is true, compile\r\nsome books on Roman history, on historical portraits, and certain family\r\nbiographies; but they were not such as made him a rival of any of his\r\ncontemporaries. They were rather the productions of a rich amateur, who\r\nhad leisure to indulge a quasi-literary taste, without any thought of\r\njoining the ranks of professed writers. Thirdly, he had great wealth,\r\npartly inherited, partly acquired by prudent speculation in the purchase\r\nof town properties, or in loans to states or public bodies on fair\r\nterms: and this wealth was at the service of his friends, but not in the\r\nlavish or reckless manner, which often earns only ingratitude without\r\nbeing of any permanent service to the recipients. He lent money, but\r\nexpected to be repaid even by his brother-in-law. And this prudence\r\nhelped to retain the confidence, while his sympathetic temperament\r\nsecured the liking, of most. Again, he had the valuable knack of\r\nconstantly replenishing the number of his friends among men junior to\r\nhimself. His character attracted the liking of Sulla, who was\r\ntwenty-seven years his senior, and he remained the close friend of his\r\ncontemporaries Hortensius and Cicero (the former five years his senior,\r\nthe latter three years his junior) till the day of their death. But we\r\nalso find him on intimate terms with Brutus, twenty-four, and Octavian,\r\nforty-six years junior to himself. Lastly, he was not too much at Rome.\r\nMore than twenty years of his earlier manhood (B.C. 87-65) were spent in\r\nGreece, principally at Athens, partly in study and partly in business.\r\nAnd Athens at this time, long deprived of political importance, had\r\nstill the charm not only of its illustrious past, but also of its\r\nsurviving character as the home of culture and refinement. When he at\r\nlength returned to Rome in B.C. 65, he had already purchased a property\r\nin Epirus, near Buthrotum (see p. 3), where he built a villa, in which\r\nhe continued to spend a considerable part of his remaining years. This\r\nwas sufficiently remote, not only from Rome, but from the summer\r\nresidences of the Roman nobles, to secure his isolation from the\r\nintrigues and enmities of Roman society. He did not indeed--as who\r\ndoes?--always escape giving offence. At the very beginning of the\r\ncorrespondence we hear of his vain attempts to mollify the anger of L.\r\nLucceius--how incurred we do not know; and Quintus Cicero, of whose\r\nsharp temper we hear so much, was on more than one occasion on the point\r\nof a rupture with him. But his family life was generally as pleasing as\r\nhis connexion with his friends. With his mother, who lived to a great\r\nage, he boasted that he had never been reconciled, because he had never\r\nquarrelled. He was the only one who could get on with the crusty uncle\r\nCæcilius. In the delicate matter of his sister Pomponia's differences\r\nwith her husband Quintus Cicero, he seems to have acted with kindness as\r\nwell as prudence; and though he married late in life (B.C. 56, when he\r\nwas in his fifty-third year), he appears to have made an excellent\r\nhusband to Pilia and a very affectionate father to his daughter. His\r\nunwearied sympathy with the varied moods of Cicero--whether of\r\nexultation, irritation, or despair--and the entire confidence which\r\nCicero feels that he will have that sympathy in every case, are\r\ncreditable to both. It is only between sincere souls that one can speak\r\nto the other as to a second self, as Cicero often alleges that he does\r\nto Atticus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quintus Tullius Cicero.]\r\n\r\nOf QUINTUS CICERO, the next most important correspondent in this volume,\r\nwe get a fairly clear picture. Four years younger than his famous\r\nbrother (b. B.C. 102), he followed him at the due distance up the ladder\r\nof official promotion to the prætorship, to which he was elected in the\r\nyear of his elder's consulship. There, however, Quintus stopped. He\r\nnever seems to have stood for the consulship. He had no oratorical\r\ngenius to give him reputation in the forum, nor were his literary\r\nproductions of any value, either for style or originality. His abilities\r\nfor administration, as shewn in his three years' government of Asia,\r\nappear to have been respectable, but were marred by faults of temper,\r\nwhich too often betrayed him into extreme violence of language. In\r\nmilitary command he shewed courage and energy in defending his camp in\r\nthe rising of the Gauls in the winter of B.C. 54-53; but he spoilt the\r\nreputation thus gained by the mistake committed in the autumn of B.C.\r\n53, which cost the loss of a considerable number of troops, and all but\r\nallowed the roving Germans to storm his camp. He remained another year\r\nin Gaul, but did nothing to retrieve this mistake. In military affairs\r\nfortune rarely forgives. In politics he seems to have contented himself\r\ngenerally with saying ditto to his brother. And this continued to be the\r\ncase up to Pharsalia. After that, finding himself on the losing side, he\r\nturned somewhat fiercely upon the brother, whom he regarded as having\r\nmisled him; and for a time there was a miserable breach between them,\r\nwhich, however, did not last very long. When the end came it found the\r\nbrothers united in heart as in misfortune. His private happiness was\r\nmarred by an uncongenial marriage. Pomponia--sister of Atticus--seems to\r\nhave been as high-tempered as her husband, and less placable. The\r\nconstant quarrels between them exercised the patience both of Cicero and\r\nAtticus, and crops up all through the correspondence. One effect of them\r\nwas the loss of all control over their son, who, being called upon to\r\nsmooth over the differences between father and mother, naturally took up\r\nat an early age a line of his own, and shewed a disposition to act\r\nindependently of his elders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terentia.]\r\n\r\nThe letters to TERENTIA do not fill much space in the correspondence,\r\nand are rarely interesting. Married about B.C. 80, Cicero seems to have\r\nlived in harmony with her at least till the time of his return from\r\nexile, during which unhappy period he acknowledges the activity of her\r\nexertions in support of his recall, and the drain which his ruin was\r\nmaking upon her resources. Terentia had a large private fortune, and\r\napparently used it liberally in his service. Nevertheless, immediately\r\non his return from exile, there seems to have been some cause of\r\ncoldness between the husband and wife. He darkly alludes to certain\r\ndomestic troubles in the first letter to Atticus written from Rome (vol\r\ni., p. 189), and repeats the hint in the next (p. 193). When he landed\r\nat Brundisium it was Tullia, not Terentia, who came to meet him (p.\r\n187), and for some time after she appears to be presiding in his house\r\nrather than Terentia (see pp. 224, 257). Whatever the cause of this\r\ncoldness was, however, it appears to have been removed for a time. He\r\nkept up a correspondence with her while he was in Cilicia (B.C. 51-50),\r\nand though he does not seem pleased at her having arranged the marriage\r\nof Tullia with Dolabella, he addresses her warmly when about to return,\r\nand was met by her on landing. During the five or six months that\r\nfollowed, before Cicero left Italy to join Pompey, there is no\r\nindication of any alienation: but the short notes from Pompey's camp,\r\nand in the first half of B.C. 47, are cold and conventional, and on his\r\nreturn to Brundisium after Pharsalia, and during his lengthened stay\r\nthere, he appears to have declined to allow her to come and see him.\r\nSoon after his return to Rome, in September, B.C. 47, matters came to a\r\nclimax. Perhaps some of the mischief was caused by the mismanagement or\r\ndishonesty of Terentia's steward, Philotimus, of whom we hear a good\r\ndeal in the letters from Cilicia: but whatever was the origin of the\r\nquarrel, Cicero asserts that on his return he found his affairs in a\r\nstate of utter disorder. It may well have been that, like other\r\nadherents to the losing cause, he had to suffer from loss of any\r\nproperty that could be easily laid hands on in Rome, and that Terentia\r\nhad had no power to save it. But Cicero, rightly or wrongly, attributed\r\nthe embarrassment which he found awaiting him to his wife. He says in a\r\nletter to Gnæus Plancius:[21] \"I should not have taken any new step at a\r\ntime of such general disaster had I not on my return found my private\r\naffairs in as sorry a position as the public. The fact is, that when I\r\nsaw that, owing to the criminal conduct of those to whom my life and\r\nfortunes ought, in return for my never-to-be-forgotten services, to have\r\nbeen their dearest object, there was nothing safe within the walls of my\r\nhouse, nothing that was not the subject of some intrigue, I made up my\r\nmind that I must arm myself by the faithful support of new marriage\r\nconnexions against the perfidy of the old.\" This is a lame excuse for a\r\nman of sixty separating from the companion of his whole manhood, and in\r\nthe eyes of Roman Society it was rendered still more questionable by a\r\nprompt marriage with a young girl, rich, and his own ward: from whom,\r\nhowever, he soon again divorced himself, angered, it is said, by her\r\nwant of feeling at the death of Tullia. Terentia long survived her\r\nhusband, living, we are told, to be over a hundred years old. Divorce\r\nwas, of course, not regarded in these days of the Republic as it had\r\nonce been, or as it is now among ourselves; still we should have been\r\nglad, both for his fame and his happiness, if the few years remaining to\r\nhim had not had this additional cloud. A man of sixty embarking on such\r\nmatrimonial enterprise is not a dignified spectacle, or one pleasing to\r\ngods and men.\r\n\r\nThe other correspondents may be dismissed in few words.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther.]\r\n\r\nP. CORNELIUS LENTULUS SPINTHER, to whom some of the longest letters are\r\naddressed, represents the high aristocracy, to which Cicero wished to\r\ncommend himself, though seeing keenly the weakness which underlay their\r\nmagnificence. The part played by Lentulus in politics had been showy,\r\nbut never founded on steadfast principle. He owed his earlier promotions\r\nto Cæsar's influence, but in his consulship of B.C. 57 had taken the\r\nside of the aristocracy in promoting the recall of Cicero, though he had\r\ngone against their sentiment by supporting Pompey's appointment to the\r\n_cura annonæ_. But as he was going to Cilicia in B.C. 56, Lentulus\r\nwished to have the lucrative task of restoring Ptolemy Auletes to the\r\nthrone of Egypt, from which he had been righteously driven by his\r\nsubjects. Therefore it was all to the good that Pompey should have\r\nbusiness at home preventing him from taking this in hand. How Lentulus\r\nwas baulked in this desire will appear in the letters. He no doubt had\r\nhis full share of the _Lentulitas_ distinguishing his family. But all\r\nwas forgiven by Cicero to a man who had promoted his recall, and he\r\ntakes great pains to justify to Lentulus his own change of policy in\r\nregard to the triumvirs after B.C. 56. When the civil war began Lentulus\r\njoined Domitius at Corfinium, and with him fell into Cæsar's hands, and\r\nwas dismissed unharmed. He afterwards joined Pompey in Epirus, intent on\r\nsucceeding Cæsar as Pontifex Maximus, as soon as the latter had been\r\nsatisfactorily disposed of. After Pharsalia he sought refuge at Rhodes,\r\nbut was refused sanctuary by the islanders, and was eventually put to\r\ndeath, though we do not know by whom (_Att._ xi. 13; _Fam._ ix. 18).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: M. Fadius Gallus, M. Marius, L. Lucceius, C. Scribonius\r\nCurio, C. Trebatius Testa.]\r\n\r\nM. FADIUS GALLUS, the Epicurean, and M. MARIUS, the valetudinarian and\r\nwit, were among friends valued for their personal and agreeable\r\nqualities rather than for any public or political importance attaching\r\nto them. The same may be said of L. LUCCEIUS, of whose Roman history\r\nCicero thought so well, that he wrote a remarkable letter begging for an\r\nhonourable place in it for his consulship, as Pliny did to Tacitus.[22]\r\nC. SCRIBONIUS CURIO, son of a great friend of Cicero, after a _jeunesse\r\norageuse_, returned to Rome from his quæstorship in Asia, in B.C. 53, to\r\ntake up the inheritance of his father, which he quickly dissipated.\r\nCicero seems to have had a high idea of his abilities, and to have\r\nbelieved him capable of taking the lead of the Optimates. But in his\r\ntribuneship of B.C. 51-50 he disappointed all such hopes by openly\r\njoining Cæsar's party, and resisting all attempts to recall him. He\r\njoined Cæsar at Ravenna as soon as his tribuneship was out, and urged\r\nhim to march on Rome. In B.C. 49 he was sent to secure Sicily and\r\nAfrica. The first he did, but in the second he perished in battle\r\nagainst the senatorial governor and king Iuba. Cicero's relation to C.\r\nTREBATIUS TESTA, a learned jurisconsult, was apparently that of a patron\r\nor tutor, who, thinking that he has found a young man of ability,\r\nendeavours to push him. He sent him with a letter of introduction to\r\nCæsar, who was good-natured, though rather sarcastic as to the scope for\r\nlegal abilities to be found in Gaul. He gave him, however, a military\r\ntribuneship, without exacting military duties, and apparently kept on\r\ngood terms with him, for he employed him in B.C. 49 to communicate his\r\nwish to Cicero as to his remaining at Rome. Cicero's letters to him,\r\nthough numerous, are not among the most interesting. They are full of\r\nbanter of a rather forced and dull kind; and Cicero was evidently\r\nannoyed to find that his scheme for advancing Trebatius in Cæsar's\r\nprovince had not been very successful. The friendship, however, survived\r\nthe civil war, and we find Cicero in B.C. 44 dedicating his _Topica_ to\r\nTrebatius.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: That Cicero up to the time of his consulship had been\r\nconnected rather with the _populares_ is illustrated by Quintus (_de\r\nPetit._ i.) urging him to make it clear that he had never been a\r\ndemagogue, but that if he had ever spoken \"in the spirit of the popular\r\nparty, he had done so with the view of attracting Pompey.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _De Orat._ ii. §§ 1, 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"The city, the city, my dear Rufus--stick to that, and live\r\nin its full light.

Coss., L. Cæcilius Metellus, Q. Marcius Rex.]\r\n\r\n     This opening of the correspondence finds Cicero, now in his\r\n     thirty-ninth year, in the midst of his official career. He had\r\n     already been quæstor (B.C. 75) and ædile (B.C. 69), and was looking\r\n     forward to his election to the prætorship in the next year (B.C.\r\n     67). He had already risen almost to the highest place in his\r\n     profession as advocate, and had partly delivered, partly published\r\n     his great indictment of Verres only a year ago. He is married to\r\n     Terentia (B.C. 80), and has one daughter, Tullia or Tulliola, born\r\n     on August 5, probably the next year (B.C. 79). His intimacy with T.\r\n     Pomponius Atticus (three years his senior), perhaps begun at\r\n     school, had lasted at least eleven years, from the time when he met\r\n     him at Athens (B.C. 79), and with him had been initiated in the\r\n     Eleusinian mysteries (_de Leg._ 2, § 36). There too they had both\r\n     seen much of the writer's cousin Lucius, whose death he deplores in\r\n     this letter (_de Fin._ 5, § 1). Atticus had lived abroad in Athens\r\n     and Epirus, with occasional visits home from B.C. 88 to B.C. 65, in\r\n     which latter year he seems to have returned for a more lengthened\r\n     stay (Nep. _Att._ 4). The two friends have already corresponded\r\n     frequently, but this is the first letter preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 68, ÆT. 38]\r\n\r\nWe are such intimate friends that more than almost anyone else you can\r\nappreciate the grief as well as the actual public and private loss that\r\nthe death of my cousin Lucius is to me. There is absolutely no\r\ngratification which any human being can receive from the kindly\r\ncharacter of another that I have not been accustomed to receive from\r\nhim. I am sure, therefore, that you will share my grief. For, in the\r\nfirst place, whatever affects me affects you; and in the second place,\r\nyou have yourself lost in him a friend and connexion of the highest\r\ncharacter and most obliging disposition, who was attached to you from\r\npersonal inclination, as well as from my conversation.\r\n\r\nAs to what you say in your letter about your sister,[23] she will\r\nherself bear me witness what pains I have taken that my brother Quintus\r\nshould show her proper affection. Thinking him somewhat inclined to be\r\nangry with her, I wrote to him in such a way as I thought would not hurt\r\nhis feelings as a brother, while giving him some good advice as my\r\njunior, and remonstrating with him as being in the wrong. The result is\r\nthat, from frequent letters since received from him, I feel confident\r\nthat everything is as it ought and as we should wish it to be.\r\n\r\nAs to the frequency of my letters you have no ground for your complaint.\r\nThe fact is our good sister Pomponia never informed me of there being a\r\ncourier ready to take a letter. Farthermore, I never chanced to know of\r\nanyone going to Epirus,[24] and I was not till recently informed of your\r\nbeing at Athens.\r\n\r\nAgain, as to the business of Acutilius which you had left in my hands. I\r\nhad settled it on my first visit to Rome after your departure. But it\r\nturned out that, in the first place, there was no urgency in the matter,\r\nand, in the second place, as I felt confidence in your judgment, I\r\npreferred that Peducæus[25] rather than myself should advise you by\r\nletter on the subject. For having submitted my ears to Acutilius for\r\nseveral days (and I think you know his style), I should scarcely have\r\nregarded it as a hardship to write you a letter describing his\r\ngrumblings after patiently enduring the bore (and it _was_ rather a\r\nbore, I can tell you) of hearing them. Moreover, though you find fault\r\nwith me, allow me to observe that I have had only one letter from you,\r\nthough you had greater leisure for writing, and more opportunity of\r\nsending letters.\r\n\r\nAs to what you say in your letter, \"Even if anyone is inclined to be\r\noffended with you, I ought to bring him to a better mind\"--I understand\r\nto what you allude, and I have not neglected the matter. But the truth\r\nis that the extent of his displeasure is something surprising. However,\r\nI have not omitted to say anything there was to say in your behalf: but\r\non what points I am to hold out your wishes, I consider, ought to be my\r\nguide. If you will write me word distinctly what they are, you will find\r\nthat I have had no desire to be more exacting, and in the future shall\r\nbe no more yielding, than you wish.[26]\r\n\r\nAs to the business of Tadius. He tells me that you have written him word\r\nthat there was no need of farther trouble, since the property is secured\r\nby prescription. I am surprised that you do not know that in the case of\r\na statutory wardship of an unmarried girl prescription cannot be\r\npleaded.[27]\r\n\r\nI am glad you like your purchase in Epirus. What I commissioned you to\r\nget for me, and anything you see suitable to my Tusculan villa, I should\r\nbe glad if you will, as you say in your letter, procure for me, only\r\ndon't put yourself to any inconvenience. The truth is, there is no other\r\nplace that gives me complete rest after all my worries and hard work.\r\n\r\nI am expecting my brother Quintus every day. Terentia has a severe\r\nattack of rheumatism. She is devoted to you, to your sister, and your\r\nmother, and adds her kindest regards in a postscript. So does my pet\r\nTulliola. Love me, and be assured that I love you as a brother.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Pomponia, married to Cicero's younger brother Quintus. We\r\nshall frequently hear of this unfortunate marriage. Quintus was four\r\nyears younger than his brother, who had apparently arranged the match,\r\nand felt therefore perhaps somewhat responsible for the result (Nep.\r\n_Att._ 5).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Atticus had estates and a villa near Buthrotum in\r\nEpirus,--_Butrinto_ in Albania, opposite Corfu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: This is probably Sext. Peducæus the younger, an intimate\r\nfriend of Atticus (Nep. _Att._ 21); his father had been prætor in Sicily\r\nwhen Cicero was quæstor (B.C. 76-75), the son was afterwards a partisan\r\nof Cæsar in the Civil War, governor of Sardinia, B.C. 48, and proprætor\r\nin Spain, B.C. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: The person alluded to is L. Lucceius, of whom we shall\r\nhear again. See Letters V, VII, VIII, CVIII. What his quarrel with\r\nAtticus was about, we do not know.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Prescriptive right to property was acquired by possession\r\n(_usus_) of two years. But no such right could be acquired to the\r\nproperty of a girl under guardianship (_pro Flacco_, § 84).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII (A I, 6)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)\r\n\r\nROME, DECEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 68, ÆT. 38]\r\n\r\nI won't give you any excuse hereafter for accusing me of neglecting to\r\nwrite. It is you that must take care that with all your leisure you keep\r\nup with me.\r\n\r\nRabirius's house at Naples,[28]for the improvement of which you have\r\ndesigns drawn out and completed in imagination, has been bought by M.\r\nFonteius[29] for 130,000 sesterces (about £1,040). I wished you to know\r\nthis in case you were still hankering after it.\r\n\r\nWe may be quite satisfied, I think, with my brother's feelings towards\r\nPomponia. He is with her at present in his villa at Arpinum, and has\r\nDecimus Turanius with him, who is great in _belles lettres_.\r\n\r\nThe date of my father's death was the 28th of November.\r\n\r\nThat is about all my news. If you light on any articles of _vertu_\r\nsuitable for a gymnasium, which would look well in the place you wot\r\nof,[30] please don't let them slip. I am so delighted with my Tusculan\r\nvilla that I never feel really happy till I get there. Let me know\r\nexactly what you are doing and intending to do about everything.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: C. Rabirius, whom Cicero defended in B.C. 63, when\r\nprosecuted by Cæsar for his share in the murder of Saturninus (B.C.\r\n100).

Fonteius made a fortune in the province of Gaul beyond\r\nthe Alps, of which he was proprætor, B.C. 77-74. In B.C. 69 he had been\r\naccused of malversation, and defended by Cicero. After his acquittal he\r\nseems to be buying a seaside residence in Campania, as so many of the\r\nmen of fashion did.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Cicero's \"gymnasium\" was some arrangement of buildings and\r\nplantations more or less on the model of the Greek gymnasia, at his\r\nTusculan villa.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII (A I, 7)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)\r\n\r\nROME, DECEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 68, ÆT. 38]\r\n\r\nAll's well at your mother's,[31] and I keep an eye on her. I have\r\nundertaken to pay L. Cincius 20,400 sesterces[32] to your credit on the\r\nIdes of February. Pray see that I receive at the earliest possible\r\nopportunity what you say in your letters that you have bought and\r\nsecured for me. I should also be very much obliged if you would, as you\r\npromised, think over the means of securing the library for me. My hope\r\nof getting the one enjoyment which I care for, when I come to retire,\r\ndepends entirely on your kindness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: The mother of Atticus lived to be ninety, dying in B.C.\r\n33, not long before Atticus himself, who at her funeral declared that\r\n\"he had never been reconciled to her, for he had never had a word of\r\ndispute with her\" (Nep. _Att._ 17).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: This sum (about £163) is for the works of art purchased\r\nfor the writer by Atticus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV (A I, 9)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 67.

It is the year\r\n     also of Pompey's great commission by the _lex Gabinia_ against the\r\n     Pirates. But Cicero does not seem as yet much concerned with\r\n     \"foreign politics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 67, ÆT. 39]\r\n\r\nI get letters from you far too seldom considering that you can much more\r\neasily find people starting for Rome than I to Athens: considering, too,\r\nthat you are more certain of my being at Rome than I of your being at\r\nAthens. For instance, it is owing to this uncertainty on my part that\r\nthis very letter is somewhat short, because not being sure as to where\r\nyou are, I don't choose my confidential talk to fall into strange hands.\r\nThe Megaric statues and the Hermæ, which you mentioned in your letters,\r\nI am waiting for impatiently. Anything you have of the same kind which\r\nmay strike you as worthy of my \"Academia,\" do not hesitate to send, and\r\nhave complete confidence in my money-chest. My present delight is to\r\npick up anything particularly suitable to a \"gymnasium.\" Lentulus\r\npromises the use of his ships. I beg you to be zealous in these matters.\r\nThyillus begs you (and I also at his request) to get him some writings\r\nof the Eumolpidæ.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV (A I, 8)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 67, ÆT. 39]\r\n\r\nAll well at your house. Your mother and sister are regarded with\r\naffection by me and my brother Quintus. I have spoken to Acutilius. He\r\nsays that he has not heard from his agent, and professes surprise that\r\nyou should make any difficulty of his having refused to guarantee you\r\nagainst farther demands. As to the business of Tadius, the announcement\r\nin your letter that you have settled the matter out of court I saw\r\ngratified and pleased him very much. That friend of mine[34]--a most\r\nexcellent man, upon my honour, and most warmly attached to me--is very\r\nangry with you. If I could but know how much you care about it, I should\r\nbe able to decide how much trouble I am to take in the matter. I have\r\npaid L. Cincius the 20,400 sesterces for the Megaric statues in\r\naccordance with your letter to me. As to your Hermæ of Pentelic marble\r\nwith bronze heads, about which you wrote to me--I have fallen in love\r\nwith them on the spot. So pray send both them and the statues, and\r\nanything else that may appear to you to suit the place you wot of, my\r\npassion, and your taste--as large a supply and as early as possible.\r\nAbove all, anything you think appropriate to a gymnasium and terrace. I\r\nhave such a passion for things of this sort that while I expect\r\nassistance from you, I must expect something like rebuke from others. If\r\nLentulus has no vessel there, put them on board anyone you please. My\r\npet Tulliola claims your present and duns me as your security. I am\r\nresolved, however, to disown the obligation rather than pay up for you.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Thyillus (sometimes written Chilius), a Greek poet living\r\nat Rome. See Letters XVI and XXI. The Eumolpidæ were a family of priests\r\nat Athens who had charge of the temple of Demeter at Eleusis. The πάτρια\r\nΕὐμολπιδῶν (the phrase used by Cicero here) may be either books of\r\nritual or records such as priests usually kept: πάτρια is an appropriate\r\nword for such rituals or records handed down by priests of one race or\r\nfamily.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Lucceius, as in the first letter and the next.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI (A I, 10)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)\r\n\r\nTUSCULUM\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 67, ÆT. 39]\r\n\r\n\"Being in my Tusculan villa\" (that's for your \"being in the\r\nCeramicus\")--however, I being there, a courier sent by your sister\r\narrived from Rome and delivered me a letter from you, announcing at the\r\nsame time that the courier who was going to you started that very\r\nafternoon. The result is that, though I do send _an_ answer, I am forced\r\nby the shortness of the time to write only these few words. First, as to\r\nsoftening my friend's feeling towards you, or even reconciling him\r\noutright, I pledge you my word to do so. Though I have been attempting\r\nit already on my own account, I will now urge the point more earnestly\r\nand press him closer, as I think I gather from your letter that you are\r\nso set upon it. This much I should like you to realize, that he is very\r\ndeeply offended; but since I cannot see any serious ground for it, I\r\nfeel confident that he will do as I wish and yield to my influence. As\r\nfor my statues and Hermeracles, pray put them on board, as you say in\r\nyour letter, at your very earliest convenience, and anything else you\r\nlight upon that may seem to you appropriate to the place you wot of,\r\nespecially anything you think suitable to a palæstra and gymnasium. I\r\nsay this because I am sitting there as I write, so that the very place\r\nitself reminds me. Besides these, I commission you to get me some\r\nmedallions to let into the walls of my little entrance-court, and two\r\nengraved stone-curbs. Mind you don't engage your library to anyone,\r\nhowever keen a lover you may find; for I am hoarding up my little\r\nsavings expressly to secure that resource for my old age. As to my\r\nbrother, I trust that all is as I have ever wished and tried to make it.\r\nThere are many signs of that result--not least that your sister is\r\n_enceinte_. As for my election, I don't forget that I left the question\r\nentirely to you, and I have all along been telling our common friends\r\nthat I have not only not asked you to come, but have positively\r\nforbidden you to do so, because I understood that it was much more\r\nimportant to you to carry through the business you have now in hand,\r\nthan it is to me to have you at my election. I wish you therefore to\r\nfeel as though you had been sent to where you are in my interests. Nay,\r\nyou will find me feeling towards you, and hear of it from others,\r\nexactly as though my success were obtained not only in your presence,\r\nbut by your direct agency.\r\n\r\nTulliola gives notice of action against you. She is dunning me as your\r\nsurety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII (A I, 11)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 67, ÆT. 39]\r\n\r\nI was doing so before spontaneously, and have been since greatly stirred\r\nby your two letters, with their earnest expressions to the same effect.\r\nBesides, Sallustius has been always at my side to prompt me to spare no\r\npains to induce Lucceius to be reconciled to you. But after doing\r\neverything that could be done, not only did I fail to renew his old\r\nfeelings towards you, but I could not even succeed in eliciting the\r\nreason of his alienation. On his part, however, he keeps harping on that\r\narbitration case of his, and the other matters which I knew very well\r\nbefore you left Rome were causing him offence. Still, he has certainly\r\ngot something else fixed deeper in his mind; and this no letters _from_\r\nyou, and no commissioning of me will obliterate as easily as you will do\r\nin a personal interview, I don't mean merely by your words, but by the\r\nold familiar expression of your face--if only you think it worth while,\r\nas you will if you will listen to me, and be willing to act with your\r\nhabitual kindness. Finally, you need not wonder why it is that, whereas\r\nI intimated in my letters that I felt hopeful of his yielding to my\r\ninfluence, I now appear to have no such confidence; for you can scarcely\r\nbelieve how much more stubborn his sentiment appears to me than I\r\nexpected, and how much more obstinate he is in this anger. However, all\r\nthis will either be cured when you come, or will only be painful to the\r\nparty in fault.\r\n\r\nAs to the sentence in your letter, \"you suppose by this time I am\r\nprætor-elect,\" let me tell you that there is no class of people at Rome\r\nso harassed by every kind of unreasonable difficulty as candidates for\r\noffice; and that no one knows when the elections will be.[35] However,\r\nyou will hear all this from Philadelphus. Pray despatch at the earliest\r\nopportunity what you have bought for my \"Academia.\" I am surprisingly\r\ndelighted with the mere thought of that place, to say nothing of its\r\nactual occupation. Mind also not to let anyone else have your books.\r\nReserve them, as you say in your letter, for me. I am possessed with the\r\nutmost longing for them, as I am with a loathing for affairs of every\r\nother kind, which you will find in an incredibly worse position than\r\nwhen you left them.[36]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: The _comitia_ were twice postponed this year. Apparently\r\nthe voting for Cicero had in each case been completed, so that he is\r\nable to say that he was \"thrice returned at the head of the poll by an\r\nunanimous vote\" (_de Imp. Pomp._ § 2). The postponement of the elections\r\nwas probably connected with the struggles of the senate to hinder the\r\nlegislation (as to bribery) of the Tribune, Gaius Cornelius (Dio, 36,\r\n38-39).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: The first allusion in these letters to the disturbed\r\nposition of public affairs. See the passage of Dio quoted in the\r\nprevious note. There were so many riots in the interval between the\r\nproclamation and the holding of the elections, not without bloodshed,\r\nthat the senate voted the consuls a guard.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII (A I, 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 66. Coss., M. Æmilius Lepidus, L. Volcatius Tullus.]\r\n\r\n     In this year Cicero was prætor, and delivered his first extant\r\n     public speech (_apud populum_) in support of the _lex Manilia_,\r\n     which gave Pompey the command in the Mithridatic War with the\r\n     provinces of Asia and Bithynia. The strict Optimates opposed it.\r\n     Cicero supported it on the grounds of the importance of the war and\r\n     the proofs Pompey had already given of military ability, courage,\r\n     personal prestige, and good fortune. He takes occasion to point out\r\n     the mischief done to the Roman name by oppressive or fraudulent\r\n     governors and imperators. In this same year he delivered one of his\r\n     ablest speeches in court in defending A. Cluentius Habitus on a\r\n     charge of poisoning. At the consular elections this year the two\r\n     first elected were disabled for bribery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)\r\n\r\nROME, JANUARY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 66, ÆT. 40]\r\n\r\nI have to inform you of the death of your grandmother from pining at\r\nyour long absence, and at the same time because she was afraid that the\r\nLatin towns would revolt and fail to bring the victims up the Alban\r\nMount. I presume that L. Saufeius will send you a letter of condolence\r\non the subject.[37] I am expecting you here in the course of January--is\r\nit a mere rumour or does it come from letters of yours to others? For to\r\nme you have not mentioned the subject. The statues which you got for me\r\nhave been landed at Caieta. I haven't seen them, for I have been unable\r\nto leave Rome. I have sent a man to clear the freightage. I am\r\nexceedingly obliged to you for having taken so much trouble to get them,\r\nand so reasonably. As to your frequent remarks in your letters about\r\npacifying my friend, I have done everything I could and tried every\r\nexpedient; but he is inveterate against you to a surprising degree, on\r\nwhat suspicions, though I think you have been told, you shall yet learn\r\nfrom me when you come. I failed to restore Sallustius[38] to his old\r\nplace in his affections, and yet he was on the spot. I tell you this\r\nbecause the latter used to find fault with me in regard to you. Well, he\r\nhas found by personal experience that _he_ is not so easy to pacify, and\r\nthat on my part no zeal has been lacking either on his or your behalf. I\r\nhave betrothed Tulliola to C. Piso Frugi, son of Lucius.[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: The point of this frigid joke is not clear. Was the\r\ngrandmother really dead? What was she to do with the Latin _feriæ_? Mr.\r\nStrachan Davidson's explanation is perhaps the best, that Cicero means\r\nthat the old lady was thinking of the Social War in B.C. 89, when the\r\nloyalty of the Latin towns must have been a subject of anxiety. She is\r\nin her dotage and only remembers old scares. This is understanding\r\n_civitates_ with _Latinæ_. Others understand _feriæ_ or _mulieres_.\r\nSaufeius, a Roman eques, was an Epicurean, who would hold death to be no\r\nevil. He was a close friend of Atticus, who afterwards saved his\r\nproperty from confiscation by the Triumvirs (Nep. _Att._ 12).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Cneius Sallustius, a learned friend of Cicero's, of whom\r\nwe shall often hear again.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: C.

The\r\nmarriage took place in B.C. 63.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX (A I, 4)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 65, ÆT. 41]\r\n\r\nYou keep on making me expect you again and again. Only the other day,\r\nwhen I thought you on the point of arriving, I was suddenly put off by\r\nyou till Quintilis (July). Now, however, I _do_ think that you should\r\ncome at the time you mention if you possibly can. You will thereby be in\r\ntime for my brother Quintus's election, will pay me a long-deferred\r\nvisit, and will settle the dispute with Acutilius. This latter Peducæus\r\nalso suggested my mentioning to you, for I think it is full time that\r\nyou settled that affair. My good offices are at your service and always\r\nhave been so. Here at Rome I have conducted the case of Gaius Macer with\r\na popular approval surpassing belief and unparalleled. Though I had been\r\ninclined to take a lenient view of his case, yet I gained much more\r\nsubstantial advantage from the popular approval on his condemnation\r\nthan I should have got from his gratitude if he had been acquitted.[40]\r\nI am very glad to hear what you say about the Hermathena. It is an\r\nornament appropriate to my \"Academia\" for two reasons: Hermes is a sign\r\ncommon to all gymnasia, Minerva specially of this particular one. So I\r\nwould have you, as you say, adorn the place with the other objects also,\r\nand the more the better. The statues which you sent me before I have not\r\nyet seen. They are in my villa at Formiæ, whither I am at this moment\r\nthinking of going. I shall get them all transferred to my Tusculan\r\nvilla. If I find myself with more than I want there I shall begin\r\nadorning Caieta. Please reserve your books, and don't despair of my\r\nbeing able to make them mine. If I succeed in that, I am superior to\r\nCrassus in wealth and look down on everybody's manors and pastures.[41]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: The annalist C. Licinius Macer was impeached _de\r\nrepetundis_ (he was prætor about B.C. 70 or 69, and afterwards had a\r\nprovince), and finding that he was going to be condemned, committed\r\nsuicide. He was never therefore condemned regularly (Val. Max. ix. 127;\r\nPlut. _Cic._ 9). Cicero presided at the court as prætor.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: The books must have been a very valuable collection, or\r\nCicero would hardly have made so much of being able to buy them,\r\nconsidering his lavish orders for statues or antiques.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX (A I, 1)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 65. Coss., L. Aurelius Cotta, L. Manlius Torquatus.]\r\n\r\n     The election to the consulship is not till the next year (B.C. 64),\r\n     but Cicero is already making preparation for it, and looking out\r\n     for support. In July his only son was born. He does not refer to\r\n     the so-called \"first Catilinarian conspiracy,\" but mentions\r\n     Catiline as a possible competitor, and even contemplates defending\r\n     him on some charge brought against him to prevent his standing for\r\n     the consulship.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)\r\n\r\nROME, JULY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 65, ÆT. 41]\r\n\r\nThe state of things in regard to my candidature, in which I know that\r\nyou are supremely interested, is this, as far as can be as yet\r\nconjectured. The only person actually canvassing is P. Sulpicius\r\nGalba.[42] He meets with a good old-fashioned refusal without reserve or\r\ndisguise. In the general opinion this premature canvass of his is not\r\nunfavourable to my interests; for the voters generally give as a reason\r\nfor their refusal that they are under obligations to me. So I hope my\r\nprospects are to a certain degree improved by the report getting about\r\nthat my friends are found to be numerous. My intention was to begin my\r\nown canvass just at the very time that Cincius[43] tells me that your\r\nservant starts with this letter, namely, in the _campus_ at the time of\r\nthe tribunician elections on the 17th of July. My fellow candidates, to\r\nmention only those who seem certain, are Galba and Antonius and Q.\r\nCornificius.[44] At this I imagine you smiling or sighing. Well, to make\r\nyou positively smite your forehead, there _are_ people who actually\r\nthink that Cæsonius[45] will stand. I don't think Aquilius will, for he\r\nopenly disclaims it and has alleged as an excuse his health and his\r\nleading position at the bar. Catiline will certainly be a candidate, if\r\nyou can imagine a jury finding that the sun does not shine at noon. As\r\nfor Aufidius and Palicanus,[46] I don't think you will expect to hear\r\nfrom me about them. Of the candidates for this year's election Cæsar is\r\nconsidered certain. Thermus is looked upon as the rival of Silanus.[47]\r\nThese latter are so weak both in friends and reputation that it seems\r\n_pas impossible_ to bring in Curius over their heads. But no one else\r\nthinks so. What seems most to my interests is that Thermus should get\r\nin with Cæsar. For there is none of those at present canvassing who, if\r\nleft over to my year, seems likely to be a stronger candidate, from the\r\nfact that he is commissioner of the _via Flaminia_, and when that has\r\nbeen finished, I shall be greatly relieved to have seen him elected\r\nconsul this election.[48] Such in outline is the position of affairs in\r\nregard to candidates up to date. For myself I shall take the greatest\r\npains to carry out all the duties of a candidate, and perhaps, as Gaul\r\nseems to have a considerable voting power, as soon as business at Rome\r\nhas come to a standstill I shall obtain a _libera legatio_ and make an\r\nexcursion in the course of September to visit Piso,[49] but so as not to\r\nbe back later than January. When I have ascertained the feelings of the\r\nnobility I will write you word. Everything else I hope will go smoothly,\r\nat any rate while my competitors are such as are now in town. You must\r\nundertake to secure for me the _entourage_ of our friend Pompey, since\r\nyou are nearer than I. Tell him I shall not be annoyed if he doesn't\r\ncome to my election.[50] So much for that business. But there is a\r\nmatter for which I am very anxious that you should forgive me. Your\r\nuncle Cæcilius having been defrauded of a large sum of money by P.\r\nVarius, began an action against his cousin A. Caninius Satyrus for the\r\nproperty which (as he alleged) the latter had received from Varius by a\r\ncollusive sale. He was joined in this action by the other creditors,\r\namong whom were Lucullus and P. Scipio, and the man whom they thought\r\nwould be official receiver if the property was put up for sale, Lucius\r\nPontius; though it is ridiculous to be talking about a receiver at this\r\nstage in the proceedings. Cæcilius asked me to appear for him against\r\nSatyrus. Now, scarcely a day passes that Satyrus does not call at my\r\nhouse. The chief object of his attentions is L. Domitius,[51] but I am\r\nnext in his regard. He has been of great service both to myself and to\r\nmy brother Quintus in our elections. I was very much embarrassed by my\r\nintimacy with Satyrus as well as that with Domitius, on whom the success\r\nof my election depends more than on anyone else. I pointed out these\r\nfacts to Cæcilius; at the same time I assured him that if the case had\r\nbeen one exclusively between himself and Satyrus, I would have done what\r\nhe wished. As the matter actually stood, all the creditors being\r\nconcerned--and that too men of the highest rank, who, without the aid of\r\nanyone specially retained by Cæcilius, would have no difficulty in\r\nmaintaining their common cause--it was only fair that he should have\r\nconsideration both for my private friendship and my present situation.\r\nHe seemed to take this somewhat less courteously than I could have\r\nwished, or than is usual among gentlemen; and from that time forth he\r\nhas entirely withdrawn from the intimacy with me, which was only of a\r\nfew day's standing.[52] Pray forgive me, and believe that I was\r\nprevented by nothing but natural kindness from assailing the reputation\r\nof a friend in so vital a point at a time of such very great distress,\r\nconsidering that he had shewn me every sort of kindness and attention.\r\nBut if you incline to the harsher view of my conduct, take it that the\r\ninterests of my canvass prevented me. Yet, even granting that to be so,\r\nI think you should pardon me, \"since not for sacred beast or oxhide\r\nshield.\"[53] You see in fact the position I am in, and how necessary I\r\nregard it, not only to retain but even to acquire all possible sources\r\nof popularity. I hope I have justified myself in your eyes, I am at any\r\nrate anxious to have done so. The Hermathena you sent I am delighted\r\nwith: it has been placed with such charming effect that the whole\r\ngymnasium seems arranged specially for it.[54] I am exceedingly obliged\r\nto you.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: One of the judices rejected by Verres on his trial, a\r\npontifex and augur.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Agent of Atticus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: C.

I have assumed a reading,\r\nsomething of this sort, _quæ cum erit absoluta, sane facile ac libenter\r\neum nunc fieri consulem viderim_. This at any rate gives nearly the\r\nrequired sense, which is that Cicero regards the influence which Thermus\r\nwill gain by managing the repair of the _Flaminia_ as likely to make him\r\na formidable candidate, and therefore he would be glad to see him\r\nelected in the present year 65 (_nunc_) rather than wait for the next,\r\nhis own year.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: C.

I hope\r\nthat if he is acquitted he will be more closely united with me in the\r\nconduct of our canvass; but if the result be otherwise I shall bear it\r\nwith resignation. Your early return is of great importance to me, for\r\nthere is a very strong idea prevailing that some intimate friends of\r\nyours, persons of high rank, will be opposed to my election. To win me\r\ntheir favour I see that I shall want you very much. Wherefore be sure to\r\nbe in Rome in January, as you have agreed to be.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 62. Coss., D. Iunius Silanus, L. Licinius Murena.]\r\n\r\n     We have no letters to or from Cicero in the years B.C. 64 and\r\n     63,[56] partly, no doubt, because Atticus was in Rome a great deal\r\n     during these years. We take up the correspondence, therefore, after\r\n     an interval of two years, which in many respects were the most\r\n     important in Cicero's life. In B.C. 64 he attained his chief\r\n     ambition by being elected to the consulship, but we have little\r\n     trace of his public actions that year, only the fragments of one\r\n     speech remaining, in defence of Q. Gallius on a charge of\r\n     _ambitus_. The animus of the popular party, however, is shewn by\r\n     the prosecution of some surviving partisans of Sulla on charges of\r\n     homicide, among them Catiline, who by some means escaped conviction\r\n     (Dio, xxxvii. 10). In the year of the consulship (B.C. 63) some of\r\n     Cicero's most important speeches were delivered. The three on the\r\n     agrarian proposals of Rullus present him to us for the first time\r\n     as discussing an important question of home politics, the disposal\r\n     of the _ager publicus_, a question which had become again prominent\r\n     owing to the great additions made to it by the confiscations of\r\n     Sulla. He also defended C. Rabirius, prosecuted by Iulius Cæsar for\r\n     the murder of Saturninus as long ago as B.C. 100, and later in the\r\n     year defended Murena on a charge of _ambitus_. Finally, the three\r\n     Catilinarian speeches illustrate the event which coloured the whole\r\n     of Cicero's life. In B.C. 62 his brother Quintus was prætor and\r\n     Cicero defended in his court P. Sulla, accused of complicity with\r\n     Catiline. On the 29th of December (B.C. 63) the tribune Q. Cæcilius\r\n     Metellus Nepos prevented Cicero from making a speech when laying\r\n     down his consulship, and went on to propose summoning Pompey to\r\n     Rome, \"to protect the lives of the citizens.\" This led to scenes of\r\n     violence, and Metellus fled to Pompey, who reached Italy late in\r\n     the year B.C. 62 from the East.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Asconius assigns this to the accusation of embezzlement in\r\nAfrica. But that seems to have been tried in the previous year, or\r\nearlier in this year. The new impeachment threatened seems to have been\r\nconnected with his crimes in the proscriptions of Sulla (Dio, xxxvii,\r\n10). Cicero may have thought of defending him on a charge relating to so\r\ndistant a period, just as he did Rabirius on the charge of murdering\r\nSaturninus (B.C. 100), though he had regarded his guilt in the case of\r\nextortion in Africa as glaring.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: The essay on the duties of a candidate attributed to\r\nQuintus is hardly a letter, and there is some doubt as to its\r\nauthenticity. I have therefore relegated it to an appendix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII (F V, 7)\r\n\r\nTO CN. POMPEIUS MAGNUS\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n_M. Tullius Cicero, son of Marcus, greets Cn. Pompeius, son of Cneius,\r\nImperator._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 62. ÆT. 44]\r\n\r\nIf you and the army are well I shall be glad. From your official\r\ndespatch I have, in common with everyone else, received the liveliest\r\nsatisfaction; for you have given us that strong hope of peace, of which,\r\nin sole reliance on you, I was assuring everyone. But I must inform you\r\nthat your old enemies--now posing as your friends--have received a\r\nstunning blow by this despatch, and, being disappointed in the high\r\nhopes they were entertaining, are thoroughly depressed. Though your\r\nprivate letter to me contained a somewhat slight expression of your\r\naffection, yet I can assure you it gave me pleasure: for there is\r\nnothing in which I habitually find greater satisfaction than in the\r\nconsciousness of serving my friends; and if on any occasion I do not\r\nmeet with an adequate return, I am not at all sorry to have the balance\r\nof kindness in my favour. Of this I feel no doubt--even if my\r\nextraordinary zeal in your behalf has failed to unite you to me--that\r\nthe interests of the state will certainly effect a mutual attachment and\r\ncoalition between us. To let you know, however, what I missed in your\r\nletter I will write with the candour which my own disposition and our\r\ncommon friendship demand. I did expect _some_ congratulation in your\r\nletter on my achievements, for the sake at once of the ties between us\r\nand of the Republic. This I presume to have been omitted by you from a\r\nfear of hurting anyone's feelings. But let me tell you that what I did\r\nfor the salvation of the country is approved by the judgment and\r\ntestimony of the whole world. You are a much greater man than Africanus,\r\nbut I am not much inferior to Lælius either; and when you come home you\r\nwill recognize that I have acted with such prudence and spirit, that\r\nyou will not be ashamed of being coupled with me in politics as well as\r\nin private friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII (F V, I)\r\n\r\nQ.

ÆT. 44]\r\n\r\nIf you are well I am glad. I had thought, considering our mutual regard\r\nand the reconciliation effected between us, that I was not likely to be\r\nheld up to ridicule in my absence, nor my brother attacked by you in his\r\ncivil existence and property for the sake of a mere word. If his own\r\nhigh character was not a sufficient protection to him, yet either the\r\nposition of our family, or my own loyal conduct to you and the Republic,\r\nought to have been sufficient to support him. As it is, I see that he\r\nhas been ruined and I abandoned by the last people in the world who\r\nought to have done so. I am accordingly in sorrow and wearing mourning\r\ndress, while actually in command of a province and army and conducting a\r\nwar. And seeing that your conduct in this affair has neither been\r\nreasonable nor in accordance with the milder methods of old times, you\r\nmust not be surprised if you live to repent it. I did not expect to find\r\nyou so fickle towards me and mine. For myself, meanwhile, neither family\r\nsorrow nor ill-treatment by any individual shall withdraw me from the\r\nservice of the state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Q.

This\r\nattempt led to riots and contests with Cato, and Nepos finally fled from\r\nRome to Pompey. By leaving Rome he broke the law as to the tribunes, and\r\nthe senate declared his office vacant, and this letter would even seem\r\nto shew that the senate declared him a public enemy.

But while saying so I also\r\nadded this--that the duty of supporting the Republic had been so divided\r\nbetween us that I was defending the city from internal treachery and the\r\ncrime of its own citizens, you Italy from armed enemies and covert\r\nconspiracy;[58] yet that this association in a task so noble and so\r\nglorious had been imperilled by your relations, who, while you had been\r\ncomplimented by me in the fullest and most laudatory terms, had been\r\nafraid of any display of mutual regard on your part being put to my\r\ncredit. As this sentence betrayed how much I had looked forward to your\r\nspeech, and how mistaken I had been in that expectation, my speech\r\ncaused some amusement, and was received with a moderate amount of\r\nlaughter; but the laugh was not against you, it was rather at my\r\nmistake, and at the open and _naïve_ confession of my eagerness to be\r\ncommended by you. Surely it cannot but be a compliment to you that in\r\nthe hour of my greatest triumph and glory I yet wished for some\r\ntestimony of approval from your lips. As to your expression,\r\n\"considering our mutual regard\"--I don't know your idea of what is\r\n\"mutual\" in friendship; mine is an equal interchange of good feeling.\r\nNow if I were to mention that I passed over a province for your sake,\r\nyou might think me somewhat insincere; for, in point of fact, it suited\r\nmy convenience, and I feel more and more every day of my life the\r\nadvantage and pleasure which I have received from that decision. But\r\nthis I do say--the moment I had announced in public meeting my refusal\r\nof a province, I began at once thinking how I might hand it on to you. I\r\nsay nothing as to the circumstances of your allotment: I only wish you\r\nto suspect that nothing was done in that matter by my colleague without\r\nmy cognizance. Recall the other circumstances: how promptly I summoned\r\nthe senate on that day after the lots had been drawn, at what a length I\r\nspoke about you. You yourself said at the time that my speech was not\r\nmerely complimentary to you, but absolutely a reflexion on your\r\ncolleagues. Farther, the decree of the senate passed on that day has\r\nsuch a preamble that, so long as it is extant, there can never be any\r\ndoubt of my services to you. Subsequently, when you had gone out of\r\ntown, I would have you recall my motions in the senate, my speeches in\r\npublic meetings, my letters to yourself. And having reviewed all these\r\ntogether, I would like you to judge yourself whether you think that your\r\napproach to Rome the last time you came quite shewed an adequate return\r\nfor all these services.[59] Again, as to your expression, \"the\r\nreconciliation effected between us\"--I do not understand why you speak\r\nof \"reconciliation\" in the case of a friendship that had never been\r\nbroken. As to what you say, that your brother Metellus ought not \"to\r\nhave been attacked by me for a mere word,\" in the first place I would\r\nlike to assure you that your feeling and fraternal partiality--so full\r\nof human kindness and natural affection--meet with my warmest\r\napprobation; in the next place I must claim your indulgence if I have in\r\nany matter opposed your brother in the interests of the Republic, for my\r\ndevotion to the Republic is paramount. If, however, it is my personal\r\nsafety that I have defended against a most ruthless assault of his, I\r\nthink you should be content that I make no complaint even to you of your\r\nbrother's injurious conduct. Now, when I had become aware that he was\r\ndeliberately making every preparation to use his tribunician office to\r\nmy ruin, I appealed to your wife Claudia[60] and your sister Mucia[61]\r\n(of whose kindness to me for the sake of my friendship with Pompey I had\r\nsatisfied myself by many instances) to deter him from that injurious\r\nconduct. And yet, as I am sure you have heard, on the last day of\r\nDecember he inflicted upon me--a consul and the preserver of my\r\ncountry--an indignity such as was never inflicted upon the most disloyal\r\ncitizen in the humblest office: that is to say, he deprived me when\r\nlaying down my office of the privilege of addressing the people--an\r\nindignity, however, which after all redounded to my honour. For, upon\r\nhis forbidding me to do anything but take the oath, I pronounced an oath\r\nat once the most absolutely true and the most glorious in a loud\r\nvoice--an oath which the people swore also in a loud voice to be\r\nabsolutely true. Though I had actually suffered this signal indignity, I\r\nyet on that same day sent common friends to Metellus to persuade him to\r\nalter his resolution; to whom he answered that he was no longer free to\r\ndo so. And, in fact, a short time previously he _had_ said in a public\r\nmeeting that a man who had punished others without trial ought not\r\nhimself to be allowed the privilege of speech. What a model of\r\nconsistency! What an admirable citizen! So he deemed the man who had\r\nsaved the senate from massacre, the city from the incendiary, Italy from\r\nwar, deserving of the same penalty as that inflicted by the senate, with\r\nthe unanimous approval of all loyal citizens, upon those who had\r\nintended to set fire to the city, butcher magistrates and senate, and\r\nstir up a formidable war! Accordingly, I did withstand your brother\r\nMetellus to his face: for on the 1st of January, in the senate, I\r\nmaintained a debate with him on the state of the Republic, such as\r\ntaught him that he had to contend with a man of courage and firmness. On\r\nthe 3rd of January,[62] on again opening the debate, he kept harping on\r\nme and threatening me at every third word of his speech; nor could any\r\nintention be more deliberate than his was to overthrow me by any means\r\nin his power, not by calm and judicial argument, but by violence and\r\nmere browbeating. If I had not shewn some boldness and spirit in\r\nopposing his intemperate attack, would not everyone have concluded that\r\nthe courage I had displayed in my consulship was the result of accident\r\nrather than design? If you did not know that Metellus was contemplating\r\nthese measures in regard to me, you must consider that you have been\r\nkept in the dark by your brother on matters of the utmost importance:\r\nif, on the other hand, he did intrust any part of his designs to you,\r\nthen surely I ought to be regarded by you as a man of placable and\r\nreasonable temper for not addressing a word of reproach to you even on\r\nsuch occurrences as these. Understanding then that it was by no \"mere\r\nword\" (as you express it) of Metellus that I was roused, but by his\r\ndeliberate policy and extraordinary animosity towards me, next observe\r\nmy forbearance--if \"forbearance\" is the name to be given to irresolution\r\nand laxity under a most galling indignity. I never once delivered a vote\r\nin a speech against your brother: every time a motion was before the\r\nhouse I assented without rising to those whose proposal appeared to me\r\nto be the mildest. I will also add that, though in the circumstances\r\nthere was no obligation upon me to do so, yet so far from raising\r\nobjections I actually did my best to secure that my enemy, because he\r\nwas your brother, should be relieved from penalties by a decree of the\r\nsenate.[63] Wherefore I have not \"attacked\" your brother, but only\r\ndefended myself from your brother's attack; nor have I been \"fickle\" (to\r\nquote your word), but, on the contrary, so constant, that I remained\r\nfaithful to my friendship to you, though left without any sign of\r\nkindness from you. For instance, at this moment, though your letter\r\namounts almost to a threat, I am writing back an answer such as you see.\r\nI not only pardon your vexation, I even applaud it in the highest\r\ndegree; for my own heart tells me how strong is the influence of\r\nfraternal affection. I ask you in your turn to put a liberal\r\nconstruction upon my vexation, and to conclude that when attacked by\r\nyour relatives with bitterness, with brutality, and without cause, I not\r\nonly ought not to retract anything, but, in a case of that kind, should\r\neven be able to rely upon the aid of yourself and your army. I have\r\nalways wished to have you as a friend: I have taken pains to make you\r\nunderstand that I am a warm friend to you. I abide by that sentiment,\r\nand shall abide by it as long as _you_ will let me; and I shall more\r\nreadily cease to be angry with your brother for love of you, than I\r\nshall from anger with him abate in the smallest degree my kindness for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Metellus had been employed with Antonius against the camp\r\nat Fæsulæ, but was now engaged against some Alpine tribes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: When Metellus was commanding against Catiline, it is\r\nsuggested that he marched towards Rome to support his brother, but this\r\nis conjecture.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: Sister of P. Clodius. Of this famous woman we shall hear\r\noften again. She is believed to be the Lesbia of Catullus, and she is\r\nthe \"Palatine Medea\" of the speech _pro Cælio_.

Civ._ i.\r\nI).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: For the riots caused by his contests with Cato (on which\r\nthe senate seems to have passed the _senatus consultum ultimum_), and\r\nfor his having left Rome while tribune.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV (F V, 6)\r\n\r\nTO P. SESTIUS[64] (IN MACEDONIA)\r\n\r\nROME, DECEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 62, ÆT. 44]\r\n\r\nDecius the copyist has been to see me, and begged me to try and secure\r\nthat no successor should be appointed to you this turn. Though I\r\nregarded him as a man of good character and attached to you, yet,\r\nremembering the tenor of your previous letter to me, I could not feel\r\ncertain that the wishes of a cautious man of the world like yourself had\r\nundergone so complete a change. But after your wife Cornelia had called\r\non Terentia, and I had had a conversation with Q. Cornelius, I took care\r\nto be present at every meeting of the senate, and found that the\r\ngreatest trouble was to make Fufius the tribune, and the others to whom\r\nyou had written, believe me rather than your own letters. The whole\r\nbusiness has, after all, been postponed till January, but there is no\r\ndifficulty about it. Roused by your congratulations--for in a letter\r\nsometime ago you wished me good luck on the completion of my purchase of\r\na house from Crassus--I have bought that very house for 3,500 sestertia\r\n(about £28,000), a good while subsequent to your congratulation.\r\nAccordingly, you may now look upon me as being so deeply in debt as to\r\nbe eager to join a conspiracy if anyone would admit me! But, partly from\r\npersonal dislike they shut their doors in my face and openly denounce me\r\nas the punisher of conspiracy, partly are incredulous and afraid that I\r\nam setting a trap for them! Nor do they suppose that a man can be short\r\nof money who has relieved the money-lenders from a state of siege. In\r\npoint of fact, money is plentiful at six per cent., and the success of\r\nmy measures has caused me to be regarded as a good security. Your own\r\nhouse, and all the details of its construction, I have examined and\r\nstrongly approve. As for Antonius,[65] though everyone notices his want\r\nof attention to my interests, I have nevertheless defended him in the\r\nsenate with the utmost earnestness and persistence, and have made a\r\nstrong impression on the senate by my language as well as by my personal\r\nprestige. Pray write to me more frequently.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: P. Sestius was serving as proquæstor in Macedonia under\r\nGaius Antonius. As tribune in B.C. 57 he worked for Cicero's recall, but\r\nwas afterwards prosecuted _de vi_, and defended by Cicero.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Gaius Antonius, Cicero's colleague in the consulship. He\r\nhad the province of Macedonia after the consulship, Cicero having\r\nvoluntarily withdrawn in his favour to secure his support against\r\nCatiline. Scandal said that he had bargained to pay Cicero large sums\r\nfrom the profits of the province. He governed so corruptly and\r\nunsuccessfully that he was on his return condemned of _maiestas_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI (A I, 12)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 61. Coss., M. Papius Piso, M. Valerius Messalla.]\r\n\r\n     The letters of this year are much concerned with the sacrilege of\r\n     P. Clodius, who, it was alleged, had been detected in disguise in\r\n     the house of the Pontifex Maximus Iulius Cæsar, when his wife was\r\n     celebrating the mysteries of the Bona Dea, from which males were\r\n     excluded. His trial was made the occasion of bitter party\r\n     struggles, and by giving evidence in contradiction of Clodius's\r\n     alibi Cicero incurred his enmity, and eventually, therefore, his\r\n     own exile. Quintus is proprætor in Asia, Cæsar in Spain. Pompey\r\n     reached Rome early this year. The _ordo equester_ is much irritated\r\n     with the senate on the question of the contracts for the collection\r\n     of the Asiatic taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)\r\n\r\nROME, 1 JANUARY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 61, ÆT. 45]\r\n\r\nThe Teucris[66] business hangs fire, and Cornelius has not called on\r\nTerentia since. I suppose I must have recourse to Considius, Axius, and\r\nSelicius:[67] for his nearest relations can't get a penny out of\r\nCæcilius[68] under twelve per cent. But to return to my first remark: I\r\nnever saw anything more shameless, artful, and dilatory. \"I am on the\r\npoint of sending my freedman,\" \"I have commissioned Titus\"--excuses and\r\ndelays at every turn! But perhaps it is a case of _l'homme propose_,[69]\r\nfor Pompey's advance couriers tell me that he means to move in the\r\nsenate that a successor to Antonius ought to be named, and the prætor\r\nintends to bring the proposal before the people at the same time. The\r\nfacts are such that I cannot defend him in view of the opinion either\r\nof the aristocrats or the people, and, what is more than anything else,\r\nthat I have no wish to do so. For a thing has happened into the truth of\r\nwhich I charge you to look thoroughly. I have a freedman, who is a\r\nworthless fellow enough; I mean Hilarus, an accountant and a client of\r\nyour own. The interpreter Valerius gives me this information about him,\r\nand Thyillus writes me word that he has been told the same story: that\r\nthe fellow is with Antonius, and that Antonius, in exacting money\r\npayments, frequently remarks that a part is being collected for me, and\r\nthat I have sent a freedman to look after our common interests. I felt\r\nexceedingly disturbed, and yet could not believe it; but at any rate\r\nthere has been some gossip of the sort. Pray look into the whole matter,\r\nlearn the truth, find out the author, and get the empty-headed idiot out\r\nof the country, if you possibly can. Valerius mentions Cn. Plancius as\r\nthe origin of this gossip. I trust you thoroughly to investigate and\r\nfind out what is at the bottom of it. I have good reason to believe that\r\nPompey is most kindly disposed to me. His divorce of Mucia is strongly\r\napproved.[70] I suppose you have heard that P. Clodius, son of Appius,\r\nwas caught in woman's clothes at Gaius Cæsar's house, while the state\r\nfunction was going on, and that he was saved and got out by means of a\r\nmaid-servant; and that the affair is causing immense scandal. I feel\r\nsure you will be sorry for it.[71] I have nothing else to tell you. And,\r\nindeed, at the moment of writing, I am in considerable distress: for a\r\ndelightful youth, my reader Sosthenes, has just died, and his death has\r\naffected me more than that of a slave should, I think, do. Pray write\r\noften. If you have no news, write just what comes uppermost.\r\n\r\n1 January, in the consulship of M. Messalla and M. Piso.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: From expressions in the following letters it seems certain\r\nthat this refers to money expected from Gaius Antonius; but we have no\r\nmeans of deciding whether or no Teucris is a pseudonym for some agent.\r\nCicero had undertaken to be the advocate and supporter of Antonius, and\r\nthough as an actual _patronus_ in court he could not take money, he may\r\nhave felt justified in receiving supplies from him. Still, he knew the\r\ncharacter of Antonius, and how such wealth was likely to be got, and it\r\nis not a pleasant affair.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Money-lenders.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: The rich and cross-grained uncle of Atticus. See Letter\r\nX.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Cicero quotes half a Greek verse of Menander's, ταὐτόματον\r\nἡμῶν, leaving Atticus to fill up the other two words, καλλίω βουλεύεται,\r\n\"Chance designs better than we ourselves.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Mucia was suspected of intriguing with Iulius Cæsar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: The chief festival of the Bona Dea (Tellus) was in May.\r\nThe celebration referred to here took place on the night between the 3rd\r\nand 4th of December. It was a state function (_pro populo_), and was\r\ncelebrated in the presence of the Vestals and the wife of the consul or\r\nprætor urbanus, _in ea domo quæ est in imperio_. As Cæsar was Pontifex\r\nMaximus, as well as prætor urbanus, it took place in the _Regia_, the\r\nPontiff's official house (Plutarch, _Cic._ 19; Dio, xxxvii. 35).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII (F V, 5)\r\n\r\nTO C. ANTONIUS (IN MACEDONIA)\r\n\r\nROME, JANUARY\r\n\r\n_M. Cicero wishes health to Gaius Antonius, son of Marcus, Imperator._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 61, ÆT. 45]\r\n\r\nThough I had resolved to write you nothing but formal letters of\r\nintroduction (not because I felt that they had much weight with you, but\r\nto avoid giving those who asked me for them an idea that there had been\r\nany diminution in our friendship), yet since Titus Pomponius is starting\r\nfor your province, who knows better than anyone else all that I feel and\r\nhave done for you, who desires your friendship and is most devotedly\r\nattached to me, I thought I must write something, especially as I had no\r\nother way of satisfying Pomponius himself. Were I to ask from you\r\nservices of the greatest moment, it ought not to seem surprising to\r\nanyone: for you have not wanted from me any that concerned your\r\ninterests, honour, or position. That no return has been made by you for\r\nthese you are the best witness: that something even of a contrary nature\r\nhas proceeded from you I have been told by many. I say \"told,\" for I do\r\nnot venture to say \"discovered,\"[72] lest I should chance to use the\r\nword which people tell me is often falsely attributed to me by you. But\r\nthe story which has reached my ears I would prefer your learning from\r\nPomponius (who was equally hurt by it) rather than from my letter. How\r\nsingularly loyal my feelings have been to you the senate and Roman\r\npeople are both witnesses. How far you have been grateful to me you may\r\nyourself estimate: how much you owe me the rest of the world estimates.\r\nI was induced to do what I did for you at first by affection, and\r\nafterwards by consistency. Your future, believe me, stands in need of\r\nmuch greater zeal on my part, greater firmness and greater labour.[73]\r\nThese labours, unless it shall appear that I am throwing away and\r\nwasting my pains, I shall support with all the strength I have; but if I\r\nsee that they are not appreciated, I shall not allow you--the very\r\nperson benefited[74]--to think me a fool for my pains. What the meaning\r\nof all this is you will be able to learn from Pomponius. In commending\r\nPomponius to you, although I am sure you will do anything in your power\r\nfor his own sake, yet I do beg that if you have any affection for me\r\nleft, you will display it all in Pomponius's business. You can do me no\r\ngreater favour than that.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: The word (_comperisse_) used by Cicero in regard to the\r\nCatilinarian conspiracy; it had apparently become a subject of rather\r\nmalignant chaff.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Cicero is hinting at the danger of prosecution hanging\r\nover the head of Antonius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Reading _tibi ipsi_ (not _ipse_), with Tyrrell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII (A 1, 13)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)\r\n\r\nROME, 27 JANUARY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 61, ÆT. 45]\r\n\r\nI have now received three letters from you--one by the hands of M.\r\nCornelius, which you gave him, I think, at Three Taverns; a second which\r\nyour host at Canusium delivered to me; a third dated, according to you,\r\nfrom on board your pinnace, when the cable was already slipped.[75] They\r\nwere all three, to use a phrase from the schools of rhetoric flavoured\r\nwith the salt of learning, and illumined with the marks of affection. In\r\nthese letters, indeed, I am urgently pressed by you to send answers, but\r\nwhat renders me rather dilatory in this respect is the difficulty of\r\nfinding a trustworthy carrier. How few of these gentry are able to\r\nconvey a letter rather weightier than usual without lightening it by\r\nskimming its contents! Besides, I do not always care to send[76]\r\nwhenever anyone is starting for Epirus: for I suppose that, having\r\noffered victims before your Amaltheia,[77] you at once started for the\r\nsiege of Sicyon. And yet I am not even certain when you start to visit\r\nAntonius or how much time you are devoting to Epirus. Accordingly, I\r\ndon't venture to trust either Achæans or Epirotes with a letter somewhat\r\nmore outspoken than usual. Now some events _have_ occurred since you\r\nleft me worth my writing to you, but they must not be trusted to the\r\nrisk of a letter being lost, opened, or intercepted.\r\n\r\nWell, then, to begin with: I was not called upon to speak first, and the\r\npacifier of the Allobroges[78] was preferred to me, and though this met\r\nwith some murmurs of disapprobation from the senate, I was not sorry it\r\nwas done. For I am thereby freed from any obligation to shew respect to\r\nan ill-conditioned man, and am at liberty to support my position in the\r\nRepublic in spite of him. Besides, the second place has a dignity almost\r\nequal to that of _princeps senatus_, and does not put one under too much\r\nof an obligation to the consul. The third called on was Catulus; the\r\nfourth, if you want to go still farther, Hortensius. The consul\r\nhimself[79] is a man of a small and ill-regulated mind, a mere buffoon\r\nof that splenetic kind which raises a laugh even in the absence of wit:\r\nit is his face rather than his facetiousness[80] that causes merriment:\r\nhe takes practically no part in public business, and is quite alienated\r\nfrom the Optimates. You need expect no service to the state from him,\r\nfor he has not the will to do any, nor fear any damage, for he hasn't\r\nthe courage to inflict it. His colleague, however, treats me with great\r\ndistinction, and is also a zealous supporter of the loyalist party. For\r\nthe present their disagreement has not come to much; but I fear that\r\nthis taint may spread farther. For I suppose you have heard that when\r\nthe state function was being performed in Cæsar's house a man in woman's\r\ndress got in,[81] and that the Vestals having performed the rite again,\r\nmention was made of the matter in the senate by Q. Cornificius--he was\r\nthe first, so don't think that it was one of us consulars--and that on\r\nthe matter being referred by a decree of the senate to the [Virgins and]\r\npontifices, they decided that a sacrilege had been committed: that then,\r\non a farther decree of the senate, the consuls published a bill: and\r\nthat Cæsar divorced his wife. On this question Piso, from friendship for\r\nP. Clodius, is doing his best to get the bill promulgated by himself\r\n(though in accordance with a decree of the senate and on a point of\r\nreligion) rejected. Messalla as yet is strongly for severe measures. The\r\nloyalists hold aloof owing to the entreaties of Clodius: bands of\r\nruffians are being got together: I myself, at first a stern Lycurgus, am\r\nbecoming daily less and less keen about it: Cato is hot and eager. In\r\nshort, I fear that between the indifference of the loyalists and the\r\nsupport of the disloyal it may be the cause of great evils to the\r\nRepublic. However, your great friend[82]--do you know whom I mean?--of\r\nwhom you said in your letter that, \"not venturing to blame me, he was\r\nbeginning to be complimentary,\" is now to all appearance exceedingly\r\nfond of me, embraces me, loves and praises me in public, while in secret\r\n(though unable to disguise it) he is jealous of me. No good-breeding, no\r\nstraightforwardness, no political morality, no distinction, no courage,\r\nno liberality! But on these points I will write to you more minutely at\r\nanother time; for in the first place I am not yet quite sure about them,\r\nand in the next place I dare not intrust a letter on such weighty\r\nmatters to such a casual nobody's son as this messenger.\r\n\r\nThe prætors have not yet drawn their lots for the provinces. The matter\r\nremains just where you left it. The description of the scenery of\r\nMisenum and Puteoli which you ask for I will include in my speech.[83] I\r\nhad already noticed the mistake in the date, 3rd of December. The points\r\nin my speeches which you praise, believe me, I liked very much myself,\r\nbut did not venture to say so before. Now, however, as they have\r\nreceived your approval, I think them much more \"Attic\" than ever. To the\r\nspeech in answer to Metellus[84] I have made some additions. The book\r\nshall be sent you, since affection for me gives you a taste for\r\nrhetoric. What news have I for you? Let me see. Oh, yes! The consul\r\nMessalla has bought Antonius's house for 3,400 sestertia (about\r\n£27,200). What is that to me? you will say. Why, thus much.

I have already described to you Pompey's first public\r\nspeech--it did not please the poor, nor satisfy the disloyal, nor find\r\nfavour with the wealthy, nor appear sound to the loyalists; accordingly,\r\nhe is down in the world.[85] Presently, on the instigation of the consul\r\nPiso, that most insignificant of tribunes, Fufius, brought Pompey on to\r\nthe platform. The meeting was in the _circus Flaminius_, and there was\r\nin the same place that day a crowd of market people--a kind of _tiers\r\nétat_.[86] He asked him to say whether he approved of the jurymen being\r\nselected by the prætor, to form a panel for the prætor himself to\r\nemploy. That was the regulation made by the senate in the matter of\r\nClodius's sacrilege. Thereupon Pompey made a highly \"aristocratic\"\r\nspeech, and replied (and at great length) that in all matters the\r\nauthority of the senate was of the greatest weight in his eyes and had\r\nalways been so. Later on the consul Messalla in the senate asked Pompey\r\nhis opinion as to the sacrilege and the bill that had been published.\r\nHis speech in the senate amounted to a general commendation of all\r\ndecrees of the house, and when he sat down he said to me, \"I think my\r\nanswer covers your case also.\"[87] When Crassus observed that Pompey had\r\ngot a cheer from the idea in men's minds that he approved my consulship,\r\nhe rose also to his feet and delivered a speech in the most\r\ncomplimentary terms on my consulship, going so far as to say that he\r\nowed it to me that he was still a senator, a citizen, nay, a free man;\r\nand that he never beheld wife, home, or country without beholding the\r\nfruits of my conduct. In short: that whole topic, which I am wont to\r\npaint in various colours in my speeches (of which you are the\r\nAristarchus), the fire, the sword--you know my paint-pots--he elaborated\r\nto the highest pitch. I was sitting next to Pompey. I noticed that he\r\nwas agitated, either at Crassus earning the gratitude which he had\r\nhimself neglected, or to think that my achievements were, after all, of\r\nsuch magnitude that the senate was so glad to hear them praised,\r\nespecially by a man who was the less under an obligation to praise me,\r\nbecause in everything I ever wrote[88] my praise of Pompey was\r\npractically a reflexion on him. This day has brought me very close to\r\nCrassus, and yet in spite of all I accepted with pleasure any\r\ncompliment--open or covert--from Pompey. But as for my own speech, good\r\nheavens! how I did \"put it on\" for the benefit of my new auditor Pompey!\r\nIf I ever did bring every art into play, I did then--period, transition,\r\nenthymeme, deduction--everything. In short, I was cheered to the echo.\r\nFor the subject of my speech was the dignity of the senate, its harmony\r\nwith the equites, the unanimity of Italy, the dying embers of the\r\nconspiracy, the fall in prices, the establishment of peace. You know my\r\nthunder when these are my themes. It was so loud, in fact, that I may\r\ncut short my description, as I think you must have heard it even in\r\nEpirus. The state of things at Rome is this: the senate is a perfect\r\nAreopagus. You cannot conceive anything firmer, more grave, or more\r\nhigh-spirited. For when the day came for proposing the bill in\r\naccordance with the vote of the senate, a crowd of our dandies with\r\ntheir chin-tufts assembled, all the Catiline set, with Curio's girlish\r\nson at their head, and implored the people to reject it. Moreover, Piso\r\nthe consul, who formally introduced the bill, spoke against it.\r\nClodius's hired ruffians had filled up the entrances to the voting\r\nboxes. The voting tickets were so manipulated that no \"ayes\" were\r\ndistributed. Hereupon imagine Cato hurrying to the rostra, delivering an\r\nadmirable invective against the consul, if we can call that an\r\n\"invective\" which was really a speech of the utmost weight and\r\nauthority, and in fact containing the most salutary advice. He is\r\nfollowed to the same effect by your friend Hortensius, and many\r\nloyalists besides, among whom, however, the contribution of Favonius was\r\nconspicuous. By this rally of the Optimates the _comitia_ is dissolved,\r\nthe senate summoned. On the question being put in a full house--in spite\r\nof the opposition of Piso, and in spite of Clodius throwing himself at\r\nthe feet of the senators one after the other--that the consuls should\r\nexhort the people to pass the bill, about fifteen voted with Curio, who\r\nwas against any decree being passed; on the other side there were fully\r\nfour hundred. So the vote passed. The tribune Fufius then gave in.[89]\r\nClodius delivered some wretched speeches to the people, in which he\r\nbestowed some injurious epithets on Lucullus, Hortensius, C. Piso, and\r\nthe consul Messalla; me he only charged with having \"discovered\"\r\neverything.[90] In regard to the assignation of provinces to the\r\nprætors, the hearing legations, and other business, the senate voted\r\nthat nothing should be brought before it till the bill had been brought\r\nbefore the people. There's the state of things at Rome for you. Yet pray\r\nlisten to this one thing more which has surpassed my hopes. Messalla is\r\na superlatively good consul, courageous, firm, painstaking; he praises,\r\nshows attachment to, and imitates me. That other one (Piso) is the less\r\nmischievous because of one vice--he is lazy, sleepy, unbusiness-like, an\r\nutter _fainéant_, but in intention he is so disaffected that he has\r\nbegun to loathe Pompey since he made the speech in which some praise was\r\nbestowed on the senate. Accordingly, he has alienated all the loyalists\r\nto a remarkable degree. And his action is not dictated by love for\r\nClodius more than by a taste for a profligate policy and a profligate\r\nparty. But he has nobody among the magistrates like himself, with the\r\nsingle exception of the tribune Fufius. The tribunes are excellent, and\r\nin Cornutus we have a quasi-Cato. Can I say more?\r\n\r\nNow to return to private matters. \"Teucris\" has fulfilled her\r\npromise.[91] Pray execute the commission you undertook. My brother\r\nQuintus, who purchased the remaining three-fourths of the house in the\r\nArgiletum for 725 sestertia (about £5,800), is now trying to sell his\r\nTusculan property, in order to purchase, if he can, the town house of\r\nPacilius. Make it up with Lucceius! I see that he is all agog to stand\r\nfor the consulship. I will do my best. Be careful to let me know exactly\r\nhow you are, where you are, and how your business goes on.\r\n\r\n13 February.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: The letter giving this description is lost.

Prof. Tyrrell's\r\nemendation, _orationibus meis, omnibus litteris_, \"in my speeches, every\r\nletter of them,\" seems to me even harsher than the MS., a gross\r\nexaggeration, and doubtful Latin. _Meis litteris_ is well supported by\r\n_literæ forenses et senatoriæ_ of _de Off._ 2, § 3, and though it is an\r\nunusual mode of referring to speeches, we must remember that they were\r\nnow published and were \"literature.\" The particular reference is to the\r\nspeech _pro Imperio Pompeii_, in which, among other things, the whole\r\ncredit of the reduction of Spartacus's gladiators is given to Pompey,\r\nwhereas the brunt of the war had been borne by Crassus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Fufius, though Cicero does not say so, must have vetoed\r\nthe decree, but in the face of such a majority withdrew his veto.

I\r\nwill write at greater length to you on these points in the letter which\r\nI shall give to Quintus himself.[93] Please let me know what you have\r\ndone about the business I confided to you, and also in your own affair;\r\nfor I have had no letter from you since you left Brundisium.

I will answer\r\nthe last first, after the manner of Homer.[94] The fact is that, so long\r\nas I had to defend the authority of the senate,[95] I battled with such\r\ngallantry and vigour that there were shouts of applause and crowds round\r\nme in the house ringing with my praise. Nay, if you ever thought that I\r\nshewed courage in political business, you certainly would have admired\r\nmy conduct in that cause. For when the culprit had betaken himself to\r\npublic meetings, and had made an invidious use of my name, immortal\r\ngods! What battles! What havoc! What sallies I made upon Piso, Curio, on\r\nthe whole of that set! How I fell upon the old men for their\r\ninstability, on the young for their profligacy! Again and again, so help\r\nme heaven! I regretted your absence not only as the supporter of my\r\npolicy, but as the spectator also of my admirable fighting. However,\r\nwhen Hortensius hit on the idea of a law as to the sacrilege being\r\nproposed by the tribune Fufius, in which there was no difference from\r\nthe bill of the consul except as to the kind of jurymen--on that point,\r\nhowever, the whole question turned--and got it carried by sheer\r\nfighting, because he had persuaded himself and others that _he_ could\r\nnot get an acquittal no matter who were the jurymen, I drew in my sails,\r\nseeing the neediness of the jurors, and gave no evidence beyond what was\r\nso notorious and well attested that I could not omit it.[96] Therefore,\r\nif you ask the reason of the acquittal--to return at length to the\r\nformer of the two questions--it was entirely the poverty and low\r\ncharacter of the jury. But that this was possible was entirely the\r\nresult of Hortensius's policy. In his alarm lest Fufius should veto the\r\nlaw which was to be proposed in virtue of a senatorial decree, he failed\r\nto see that it was better that the culprit should be left under a cloud\r\nof disgrace and dishonour than that he should be trusted to the\r\ndiscretion of a weak jury. But in his passionate resentment he hastened\r\nto bring the case into court, saying that a leaden sword was good enough\r\nto cut _his_ throat. But if you want to know the history of the trial,\r\nwith its incredible verdict, it was such that Hortensius's policy is now\r\nblamed by other people after the event, though I disapproved of it from\r\nthe first. When the rejection of jurors had taken place, amidst loud\r\ncheers and counter-cheers--the accuser like a strict censor rejecting\r\nthe most worthless, the defendant like a kind-hearted trainer of\r\ngladiators all the best--as soon as the jury had taken their seats, the\r\nloyalists at once began to feel distrust. There never was a seedier lot\r\nround a table in a gambling hell. Senators under a cloud, equites out at\r\nelbows, tribunes who were not so much made of money as \"collectors\" of\r\nit, according to their official title.[97] However, there were a few\r\nhonest men in the panel, whom he had been unable to drive off it by\r\nrejection, and they took their seats among their uncongenial comrades\r\nwith gloomy looks and signs of emotion, and were keenly disgusted at\r\nhaving to rub elbows with such rascals. Hereupon, as question after\r\nquestion was referred to the panel in the preliminary proceedings, the\r\nseverity of the decisions passes belief: there was no disagreement in\r\nvoting, the defendant carried none of his points, while the accuser got\r\neven more than he asked. He was triumphant. Need I say more? Hortensius\r\nwould have it that he was the only one of us who had seen the truth.\r\nThere was not a man who did not think it impossible for him to stand his\r\ntrial without being condemned a thousand times over. Farther, when I was\r\nproduced as a witness, I suppose you have been told how the shouts of\r\nClodius's supporters were answered by the jury rising to their feet to\r\ngather round me, and openly to offer their throats to P. Clodius in my\r\ndefence. This seemed to me a greater compliment than the well-known\r\noccasion when your fellow citizens[98] stopped Xenocrates from taking an\r\noath in the witness-box, or when, upon the accounts of Metellus\r\nNumidicus[99] being as usual handed round, a Roman jury refused to look\r\nat them. The compliment paid me, I repeat, was much greater.\r\nAccordingly, as the jurymen were protecting me as the mainstay of the\r\ncountry, it was by their voices that the defendant was overwhelmed, and\r\nwith him all his advocates suffered a crushing blow. Next day my house\r\nwas visited by as great a throng as that which escorted me home when I\r\nlaid down the consulship. Our eminent Areopagites then exclaimed that\r\nthey would not come into court unless a guard was assigned them. The\r\nquestion was put to the whole panel: there was only one vote against the\r\nneed of a guard. The question is brought before the senate: the decree\r\nis passed in the most solemn and laudatory terms: the jurymen are\r\ncomplimented: the magistrates are commissioned to carry it out: no one\r\nthought that the fellow would venture on a defence. \"Tell me, ye Muses,\r\nnow how first the fire befell!\"[100] You know Bald-head, the Nanneian\r\nmillionaire,[101] that panegyrist of mine, whose complimentary oration\r\nI have already mentioned to you in a letter. In two days' time, by the\r\nagency of a single slave, and one, too, from a school of gladiators, he\r\nsettled the whole business--he summoned them to an interview, made a\r\npromise, offered security, paid money down. Still farther, good heavens,\r\nwhat a scandal! even favours from certain ladies, and introductions to\r\nyoung men of rank, were thrown in as a kind of _pourboire_ to some of\r\nthe jurors. Accordingly, with the loyalists holding completely aloof,\r\nwith the forum full of slaves, twenty-five jurors were yet found so\r\ncourageous that, though at the risk of their lives, they preferred even\r\ndeath to producing universal ruin. There were thirty-one who were more\r\ninfluenced by famine than fame. On seeing one of these latter Catulus\r\nsaid to him, \"Why did you ask us for a guard? Did you fear being robbed\r\nof the money?\" There you have, as briefly as I could put it, the nature\r\nof the trial and the cause of the acquittal.\r\n\r\nNext you want to know the present state of public affairs and of my own.\r\nThat settlement of the Republic--firmly established by my wisdom, as you\r\nthought, as I thought by God's--which seemed fixed on a sure foundation\r\nby the unanimity of all loyalists and the influence of my\r\nconsulship--that I assure you, unless some God take compassion on us,\r\nhas by this one verdict escaped from our grasp: if \"verdict\" it is to be\r\ncalled, when thirty of the most worthless and dissolute fellows in Rome\r\nfor a paltry sum of money obliterate every principle of law and justice,\r\nand when that which every man--I had almost said every animal--knows to\r\nhave taken place, a Thalna, a Plautus, and a Spongia, and other scum of\r\nthat sort decide not to have taken place. However, to console you as to\r\nthe state of the Republic, rascaldom is not as cheerful and exultant in\r\nits victory as the disloyal hoped after the infliction of such a wound\r\nupon the Republic. For they fully expected that when religion, morality,\r\nthe honour of juries, and the prestige of the senate had sustained such\r\na crushing fall, victorious profligacy and lawless lust would openly\r\nexact vengeance from all the best men for the mortification which the\r\nstrictness of my consulship had branded in upon all the worst. And it is\r\nonce more I--for I do not feel as if I were boasting vaingloriously when\r\nspeaking of myself to you, especially in a letter not intended to be\r\nread by others--it was I once more, I say, who revived the fainting\r\nspirits of the loyalists, cheering and encouraging each personally.\r\nMoreover, by my denunciations and invectives against those corrupt\r\njurors I left none of the favourers and supporters of that victory a\r\nword to say for themselves. I gave the consul Piso no rest anywhere, I\r\ngot him deprived of Syria, which had been already plighted to him, I\r\nrevived the fainting spirit of the senate and recalled it to its former\r\nseverity. I overwhelmed Clodius in the senate to his face, both in a set\r\nspeech, very weighty and serious, and also in an interchange of\r\nrepartees, of which I append a specimen for your delectation. The rest\r\nlose all point and grace without the excitement of the contest, or, as\r\nyou Greeks call it, the ἀγών. Well, at the meeting of the senate on the\r\n15th of May, being called on for my opinion, I spoke at considerable\r\nlength on the high interests of the Republic, and brought in the\r\nfollowing passage by a happy inspiration: \"Do not, Fathers, regard\r\nyourselves as fallen utterly, do not faint, because you have received\r\none blow. The wound is one which I cannot disguise, but which I yet feel\r\nsure should not be regarded with extreme fear: to fear would shew us to\r\nbe the greatest of cowards, to ignore it the greatest of fools. Lentulus\r\nwas twice acquitted, so was Catiline, a third such criminal has now been\r\nlet loose by jurors upon the Republic. You are mistaken, Clodius: it is\r\nnot for the city but for the prison that the jurors have reserved you,\r\nand their intention was not to retain you in the state, but to deprive\r\nyou of the privilege of exile. Wherefore, Fathers, rouse up all your\r\ncourage, hold fast to your high calling. There still remains in the\r\nRepublic the old unanimity of the loyalists: their feelings have been\r\noutraged, their resolution has not been weakened: no fresh mischief has\r\nbeen done, only what was actually existing has been discovered. In the\r\ntrial of one profligate many like him have been detected.\"--But what am\r\nI about? I have copied almost a speech into a letter. I return to the\r\nduel of words. Up gets our dandified young gentleman, and throws in my\r\nteeth my having been at Baiæ. It wasn't true, but what did that matter\r\nto him? \"It is as though you were to say,\" replied I, \"that I had been\r\nin disguise!\" \"What business,\" quoth he, \"has an Arpinate with hot\r\nbaths?\" \"Say that to your patron,\" said I, \"who coveted the\r\nwatering-place of an Arpinate.\"[102] For you know about the marine\r\nvilla. \"How long,\" said he, \"are we to put up with this king?\" \"Do you\r\nmention a king,\" quoth I, \"when Rex[103] made no mention of you?\" He,\r\nyou know, had swallowed the inheritance of Rex in anticipation. \"You\r\nhave bought a house,\" says he. \"You would think that he said,\" quoth I,\r\n\"you have bought a jury.\" \"They didn't trust you on your oath,\" said he.\r\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"twenty-five jurors did trust me, thirty-one didn't trust\r\nyou, for they took care to get their money beforehand.\" Here he was\r\noverpowered by a burst of applause and broke down without a word to say.\r\n\r\nMy own position is this: with the loyalists I hold the same place as\r\nwhen you left town, with the tagrag and bobtail of the city I hold a\r\nmuch better one than at your departure. For it does me no harm that my\r\nevidence appears not to have availed. Envy has been let blood without\r\ncausing pain, and even more so from the fact that all the supporters of\r\nthat flagitious proceeding confess that a perfectly notorious fact has\r\nbeen hushed up by bribing the jury. Besides, the wretched starveling\r\nmob, the blood-sucker of the treasury, imagines me to be high in the\r\nfavour of Magnus--and indeed we have been mutually united by frequent\r\npleasant intercourse to such an extent, that our friends the boon\r\ncompanions of the conspiracy, the young chin-tufts, speak of him in\r\nordinary conversation as Gnæus Cicero. Accordingly, both in the circus\r\nand at the gladiatorial games, I received a remarkable ovation without a\r\nsingle cat-call. There is at present a lively anticipation of the\r\nelections, in which, contrary to everybody's wishes, our friend Magnus\r\nis pushing the claims of Aulus's son;[104] and in that matter his\r\nweapons are neither his prestige nor his popularity, but those by which\r\nPhilip said that any fortress could be taken--if only an ass laden with\r\ngold could make its way up into it. Farthermore, that precious consul,\r\nplaying as it were second fiddle to Pompey,[105] is said to have\r\nundertaken the business and to have bribery agents at his house, which I\r\ndon't believe. But two decrees have already passed the house of an\r\nunpopular character, because they are thought to be directed against the\r\nconsul on the demand of Cato and Domitius[106]--one that search should\r\nbe allowed in magistrates' houses, and a second, that all who had\r\nbribery agents in their houses were guilty of treason. The tribune Lurco\r\nalso, having entered on his office irregularly in view of the Ælian law,\r\nhas been relieved from the provisions both of the Ælian and Fufian laws,\r\nin order to enable him to propose his law on bribery, which he\r\npromulgated with correct auspices though a cripple.[107] Accordingly,\r\nthe _comitia_ have been postponed to the 27th of July. There is this\r\nnovelty in his bill, that a man who has promised money among the tribes,\r\nbut not paid it, is not liable, but, if he has paid, he is liable for\r\nlife to pay 3,000 sesterces to each tribe. I remarked that P. Clodius\r\nhad obeyed this law by anticipation, for he was accustomed to promise,\r\nand not pay. But observe! Don't you see that the consulship of which we\r\nthought so much, which Curio used of old to call an apotheosis, if this\r\nAfranius is elected, will become a mere farce and mockery? Therefore I\r\nthink one should play the philosopher, as you in fact do, and not care a\r\nstraw for your consulships!\r\n\r\nYou say in your letter that you have decided not to go to Asia. For my\r\npart I should have preferred your going, and I fear that there may be\r\nsome offence[108] given in that matter. Nevertheless, I am not the man\r\nto blame you, especially considering that I have not gone to a province\r\nmyself. I shall be quite content with the inscriptions you have placed\r\nin your Amaltheium,[109] especially as Thyillus has deserted me and\r\nArchias written nothing about me. The latter, I am afraid, having\r\ncomposed a Greek poem on the Luculli, is now turning his attention to\r\nthe Cæcilian drama.[110] I have thanked Antonius on your account, and I\r\nhave intrusted the letter to Mallius. I have heretofore written to you\r\nmore rarely because I had no one to whom I could trust a letter, and was\r\nnot sure of your address. I have puffed you well. If Cincius should\r\nrefer any business of yours to me, I will undertake it. But at present\r\nhe is more intent on his own business, in which I am rendering him some\r\nassistance. If you mean to stay any length of time in one place you may\r\nexpect frequent letters from me: but pray send even more yourself. I\r\nwish you would describe your Amaltheium to me, its decoration and its\r\nplan; and send me any poems or stories you may have about\r\nAmaltheia.[111] I should like to make a copy of it at Arpinum. I will\r\nforward you something of what I have written. At present there is\r\nnothing finished.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: ὕστερον πρότερον Ὁμηρικῶς.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: That is, the resolution of the senate, that the consuls\r\nshould endeavour to get the bill passed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: Cicero deposed to having seen Clodius in Rome three hours\r\nafter he swore that he was at Interamna (ninety miles off), thus\r\nspoiling his alibi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: The difficulty of this sentence is well known.

Possibly they were old tribal officers who had the duty of\r\ndistributing pay or collecting taxes (to which the translation supposes\r\na punning reference), and as such were required to be of a _census_\r\nimmediately below that of the equites.

And yet I was\r\nalready aware, as I saw that you also, when you took leave of me, were\r\nbeginning to suspect, that there was some lurking dissatisfaction, that\r\nhis feelings were wounded, and that certain unfriendly suspicions had\r\nsunk deep into his heart. On trying on several previous occasions, but\r\nmore eagerly than ever after the allotment of his province, to assuage\r\nthese feelings, I failed to discover on the one hand that the extent of\r\nhis offence was so great as your letter indicates; but on the other I\r\ndid not make as much progress in allaying it as I wished. However, I\r\nconsoled myself with thinking that there would be no doubt of his seeing\r\nyou at Dyrrachium, or somewhere in your part of the country: and, if\r\nthat happened, I felt sure and fully persuaded that everything would be\r\nmade smooth between you, not only by conversation and mutual\r\nexplanation, but by the very sight of each other in such an interview.\r\nFor I need not say in writing to you, who know it quite well, how kind\r\nand sweet-tempered my brother is, as ready to forgive as he is sensitive\r\nin taking offence. But it most unfortunately happened that you did not\r\nsee him anywhere. For the impression he had received from the artifices\r\nof others had more weight with him than duty or relationship, or the\r\nold affection so long existing between you, which ought to have been the\r\nstrongest influence of all. And yet, as to where the blame for this\r\nmisunderstanding resides, I can more easily conceive than write: since I\r\nam afraid that, while defending my own relations, I should not spare\r\nyours. For I perceive that, though no actual wound was inflicted by\r\nmembers of the family, they yet could at least have cured it. But the\r\nroot of the mischief in this case, which perhaps extends farther than\r\nappears, I shall more conveniently explain to you when we meet. As to\r\nthe letter he sent to you from Thessalonica,[113] and about the language\r\nwhich you suppose him to have used both at Rome among your friends and\r\non his journey, I don't know how far the matter went, but my whole hope\r\nof removing this unpleasantness rests on your kindness. For if you will\r\nonly make up your mind to believe that the best men are often those\r\nwhose feelings are most easily irritated and appeased, and that this\r\nquickness, so to speak, and sensitiveness of disposition are generally\r\nsigns of a good heart; and lastly--and this is the main thing--that we\r\nmust mutually put up with each other's gaucheries (shall I call them?),\r\nor faults, or injurious acts, then these misunderstandings will, I hope,\r\nbe easily smoothed away. I beg you to take this view, for it is the\r\ndearest wish of my heart (which is yours as no one else's can be) that\r\nthere should not be one of my family or friends who does not love you\r\nand is not loved by you.\r\n\r\nThat part of your letter was entirely superfluous, in which you mention\r\nwhat opportunities of doing good business in the provinces or the city\r\nyou let pass at other times as well as in the year of my consulship: for\r\nI am thoroughly persuaded of your unselfishness and magnanimity, nor did\r\nI ever think that there was any difference between you and me except in\r\nour choice of a career. Ambition led me to seek official advancement,\r\nwhile another and perfectly laudable resolution led you to seek an\r\nhonourable privacy. In the true glory, which is founded on honesty,\r\nindustry, and piety, I place neither myself nor anyone else above you.\r\nIn affection towards myself, next to my brother and immediate family, I\r\nput you first. For indeed, indeed I have seen and thoroughly appreciated\r\nhow your anxiety and joy have corresponded with the variations of my\r\nfortunes. Often has your congratulation added a charm to praise, and\r\nyour consolation a welcome antidote to alarm. Nay, at this moment of\r\nyour absence, it is not only your advice--in which you excel--but the\r\ninterchange of speech--in which no one gives me so much delight as you\r\ndo--that I miss most, shall I say in politics, in which circumspection\r\nis always incumbent on me, or in my forensic labour, which I formerly\r\nsustained with a view to official promotion, and nowadays to maintain my\r\nposition by securing popularity, or in the mere business of my family?\r\nIn all these I missed you and our conversations before my brother left\r\nRome, and still more do I miss them since. Finally, neither my work nor\r\nrest, neither my business nor leisure, neither my affairs in the forum\r\nor at home, public or private, can any longer do without your most\r\nconsolatory and affectionate counsel and conversation. The modest\r\nreserve which characterizes both of us has often prevented my mentioning\r\nthese facts; but on this occasion it was rendered necessary by that part\r\nof your letter in which you expressed a wish to have yourself and your\r\ncharacter \"put straight\" and \"cleared\" in my eyes. Yet, in the midst of\r\nall this unfortunate alienation and anger, there is one fortunate\r\ncircumstance--that your determination of not going to a province was\r\nknown to me and your other friends, and had been at various times before\r\ndistinctly expressed by yourself; so that your not being his guest may\r\nbe attributed to your personal tastes and judgments, not to the quarrel\r\nand rupture between you. And so those ties which have been broken will\r\nbe restored, and ours which have been so religiously preserved will\r\nretain all their old inviolability.\r\n\r\nAt Rome I find politics in a shaky condition; everything is\r\nunsatisfactory and foreboding change. For I have no doubt you have been\r\ntold that our friends, the equites, are all but alienated from the\r\nsenate. Their first grievance was the promulgation of a bill on the\r\nauthority of the senate for the trial of such as had taken bribes for\r\ngiving a verdict. I happened not to be in the house when that decree was\r\npassed, but when I found that the equestrian order was indignant at it,\r\nand yet refrained from openly saying so, I remonstrated with the\r\nsenate, as I thought, in very impressive language, and was very weighty\r\nand eloquent considering the unsatisfactory nature of my cause. But here\r\nis another piece of almost intolerable coolness on the part of the\r\nequites, which I have not only submitted to, but have even put in as\r\ngood a light as possible! The companies which had contracted with the\r\ncensors for Asia complained that in the heat of the competition they had\r\ntaken the contract at an excessive price; they demanded that the\r\ncontract should be annulled. I led in their support, or rather, I was\r\nsecond, for it was Crassus who induced them to venture on this demand.\r\nThe case is scandalous, the demand a disgraceful one, and a confession\r\nof rash speculation. Yet there was a very great risk that, if they got\r\nno concession, they would be completely alienated from the senate. Here\r\nagain I came to the rescue more than anyone else, and secured them a\r\nfull and very friendly house, in which I, on the 1st and 2nd of\r\nDecember, delivered long speeches on the dignity and harmony of the two\r\norders. The business is not yet settled, but the favourable feeling of\r\nthe senate has been made manifest: for no one had spoken against it\r\nexcept the consul-designate, Metellus; while our hero Cato had still to\r\nspeak, the shortness of the day having prevented his turn being reached.\r\nThus I, in the maintenance of my steady policy, preserve to the best of\r\nmy ability that harmony of the orders which was originally my joiner's\r\nwork; but since it all now seems in such a crazy condition, I am\r\nconstructing what I may call a road towards the maintenance of our\r\npower, a safe one I hope, which I cannot fully describe to you in a\r\nletter, but of which I will nevertheless give you a hint. _I cultivate\r\nclose intimacy with Pompey_. I foresee what you will say. I will use all\r\nnecessary precautions, and I will write another time at greater length\r\nabout my schemes for managing the Republic. You must know that Lucceius\r\nhas it in his mind to stand for the consulship at once; for there are\r\nsaid to be only two candidates in prospect. Cæsar is thinking of coming\r\nto terms with him by the agency of Arrius, and Bibulus also thinks he\r\nmay effect a coalition with him by means of C. Piso.[114] You smile?\r\nThis is no laughing matter, believe me. What else shall I write to you?\r\nWhat? I have plenty to say, but must put it off to another time. If you\r\nmean to wait till you hear, let me know. For the moment I am satisfied\r\nwith a modest request, though it is what I desire above everything--that\r\nyou should come to Rome as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n5 December.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: Cicero is evidently very anxious as to the\r\nmisunderstanding between Quintus and his brother-in-law Atticus, caused,\r\nas he hints, or at any rate not allayed, by Pomponia. The letter is very\r\ncarefully written, without the familiar tone and mixture of jest and\r\nearnest common to most of the letters to Atticus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: At the end of the _via Egnatia_, which started from\r\nDyrrachium.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: The election in question is that to be held in B.C. 60\r\nfor the consulship of B.C. 59. Cæsar and Bibulus were elected, and\r\napparently were the only two candidates declared as yet. They were, of\r\ncourse, extremists, and Lucceius seems to reckon on getting in by\r\nforming a coalition with either one or the other, and so getting the\r\nsupport of one of the extreme parties, with the moderates, for himself.\r\nThe bargain eventually made was between Lucceius and Cæsar, the former\r\nfinding the money. But the Optimates found more, and carried Bibulus.\r\nArrius is Q. Arrius the orator (see Index). C. Piso is the consul of\r\nB.C. 67.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII (A I, 18)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 60. Coss., Q. Cæcilius Metellus Celer, L. Afranius.]\r\n\r\n     This was the year in which Cæsar, returning from his proprætorship\r\n     in Spain, found Pompey in difficulties with the senate (1) as to\r\n     the confirmation _en bloc_ of his _acta_ in the East, (2) as to the\r\n     assignation of lands to his veterans; and being met with opposition\r\n     himself as to the triumph that he claimed, and his candidatureship\r\n     for the consulship, he formed with Pompey and Crassus the agreement\r\n     known as the first triumvirate. Cicero saw his favourite political\r\n     object, the _concordia ordinum_, threatened by any opposition to\r\n     the triumvirate, which he yet distrusted as dangerous to the\r\n     constitution. We shall find him, therefore, vacillating between\r\n     giving his support to its policy or standing by the extreme\r\n     Optimates. P. Clodius is taking measures to be adopted into a\r\n     plebeian gens, in order to stand for the tribuneship. Quintus is\r\n     still in Asia. Pompey's triumph had taken place in the previous\r\n     September.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)\r\n\r\nROME, 20 JANUARY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 60, ÆT. 46]\r\n\r\nBelieve me there is nothing at this moment of which I stand so much in\r\nneed as a man with whom to share all that causes me anxiety: a man to\r\nlove me; a man of sense to whom I can speak without affectation,\r\nreserve, or concealment. For my brother is away--that most open-hearted\r\nand affectionate of men. Metellus is not a human being, but\r\n\r\n    \"Mere sound and air, a howling wilderness.\"\r\n\r\nWhile you, who have so often lightened my anxiety and my anguish of soul\r\nby your conversation and advice, who are ever my ally in public affairs,\r\nmy confidant in all private business, the sharer in all my conversations\r\nand projects--where are you? So entirely am I abandoned by all, that the\r\nonly moments of repose left me are those which are spent with my wife,\r\npet daughter, and sweet little Cicero. For as to those friendships with\r\nthe great, and their artificial attractions, they have indeed a certain\r\nglitter in the outside world, but they bring no private satisfaction.\r\nAnd so, after a crowded morning _levée_, as I go down to the forum\r\nsurrounded by troops of friends, I can find no one out of all that crowd\r\nwith whom to jest freely, or into whose ear I can breathe a familiar\r\nsigh. Therefore I wait for you, I long for you, I even urge on you to\r\ncome; for I have many anxieties, many pressing cares, of which I think,\r\nif I once had your ears to listen to me, I could unburden myself in the\r\nconversation of a single walk. And of my private anxieties, indeed, I\r\nshall conceal all the stings and vexations, and not trust them to this\r\nletter and an unknown letter-carrier. These, however--for I don't want\r\nyou to be made too anxious--are not very painful: yet they are\r\npersistent and worrying, and are not put to rest by the advice or\r\nconversation of any friend. But in regard to the Republic I have still\r\nthe same courage and purpose, though it has again and again of its own\r\nact eluded treatment.[115] For should I put briefly what has occurred\r\nsince you left, you would certainly exclaim that the Roman empire cannot\r\nbe maintained much longer. Well, after your departure our first scene,\r\nI think, was the appearance of the Clodian scandal, in which having, as\r\nI thought, got an opportunity of pruning licentiousness and keeping our\r\nyoung men within bounds, I exerted myself to the utmost, and lavished\r\nall the resources of my intellect and genius, not from dislike to an\r\nindividual, but from the hope of not merely correcting, but of\r\ncompletely curing the state. The Republic received a crushing blow when\r\nthis jury was won over by money and the opportunity of debauchery. See\r\nwhat has followed! We have had a consul inflicted upon us, whom none\r\nexcept us philosophers can look at without a sigh. What a blow that is!\r\nThough a decree of the senate has been passed about bribery and the\r\ncorruption of juries, no law has been carried; the senate has been\r\nharassed to death, the Roman knights alienated. So that one year has\r\nundermined two buttresses of the Republic, which owed their existence to\r\nme, and me alone; for it has at once destroyed the prestige of the\r\nsenate and broken up the harmony of the orders. And now enter this\r\nprecious year! It was inaugurated by the suspension of the annual rites\r\nof Iuventas;[116] for Memmius initiated M. Lucullus's wife in some rites\r\nof his own! Our Menelaus, being annoyed at that, divorced his wife. Yet\r\nthe old Idæan shepherd had only injured Menelaus; our Roman Paris\r\nthought Agamemnon as proper an object of injury as Menelaus.[117] Next\r\nthere is a certain tribune named C. Herennius, whom you, perhaps, do not\r\neven know--and yet you may know him, for he is of your tribe, and his\r\nfather Sextus used to distribute money to your tribesmen--this person is\r\ntrying to transfer P. Clodius to the plebs, and is actually proposing a\r\nlaw to authorize the whole people to vote in Clodius's affair in the\r\n_campus_.[118] I have given him a characteristic reception in the\r\nsenate, but he is the thickest-skinned fellow in the world. Metellus is\r\nan excellent consul, and much attached to me, but he has lowered his\r\ninfluence by promulgating (though only for form's sake) an identical\r\nbill about Clodius. But the son of Aulus,[119] God in heaven! What a\r\ncowardly and spiritless fellow for a soldier! How well he deserves to be\r\nexposed, as he is, day after day to the abuse of Palicanus![120]\r\nFarther, an agrarian law has been promulgated by Flavius, a poor\r\nproduction enough, almost identical with that of Plotius. But meanwhile\r\na genuine statesman is not to be found, even \"in a dream.\" The man who\r\ncould be one, my friend Pompey--for such he is, as I would have you\r\nknow--defends his twopenny embroidered toga[121] by saying nothing.\r\nCrassus never risks his popularity by a word. The others you know\r\nwithout my telling you. They are such fools that they seem to expect\r\nthat, though the Republic is lost, their fish-ponds will be safe. There\r\nis one man who does take some trouble, but rather, as it seems to me,\r\nwith consistency and honesty, than with either prudence or\r\nability--Cato. He has been for the last three months worrying those\r\nunhappy _publicani_, who were formerly devoted to him, and refuses to\r\nallow of an answer being given them by the senate. And so we are forced\r\nto suspend all decrees on other subjects until the _publicani_ have got\r\ntheir answer. For the same reason I suppose even the business of the\r\nforeign embassies will be postponed. You now understand in what stormy\r\nwater we are: and as from what I have written to you in such strong\r\nterms you have a view also of what I have not written, come back to me,\r\nfor it is time you did. And though the state of affairs to which I\r\ninvite you is one to be avoided, yet let your value for me so far\r\nprevail, as to induce you to come there even in these vexatious\r\ncircumstances. For the rest I will take care that due warning is given,\r\nand a notice put up in all places, to prevent you being entered on the\r\ncensus as absent; and to get put on the census just before the\r\nlustration is the mark of your true man of business.[122] So let me see\r\nyou at the earliest possible moment. Farewell.\r\n\r\n20 January in the Consulship of Q. Metellus and L. Afranius.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Reading (mainly with Schutz) _animus præsens et voluntas,\r\ntamen etiam atque etiam ipsa medicinam refugit_. The verb _refugit_ is\r\nvery doubtful, but it gives nearly the sense required. Cicero is ready\r\nto be as brave and active as before, but the state will not do its part.\r\nIt has, for instance, blundered in the matter of the law against\r\njudicial corruption. The senate offended the equites by proposing it,\r\nand yet did not carry the law. I think _animus_ and _voluntas_ must\r\nrefer to Cicero, not the state, to which in his present humour he would\r\nnot attribute them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: The temple of Iuventas was vowed by M. Livius after the\r\nbattle of the Metaurus (B.C. 207), and dedicated in B.C. 191 by C.\r\nLicinius Lucullus, games being established on the anniversary of its\r\ndedication (Livy, xxi. 62; xxxvi. 36). It is suggested, therefore, that\r\nsome of the Luculli usually presided at these games, but on this\r\noccasion refused, because of the injury done by C. Memmius, who was\r\ncurule ædile.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: By Agamemnon and Menelaus Cicero means Lucius and Marcus\r\nLucullus; the former Memmius had, as tribune in B.C. 66-65, opposed in\r\nhis demand for a triumph, the latter he has now injured in the person of\r\nhis wife.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: A man who was _sui iuris_ was properly adopted before the\r\n_commitia curiata_, now represented by thirty lictors. What Herennius\r\nproposed was that it should take place by a regular _lex_, passed by the\r\n_comitia tributa_. The object apparently was to avoid the necessity of\r\nthe presence of a pontifex and augur, which was required at the _comitia\r\ncuriata_. The concurrent law by the consul would come before the\r\n_comitia centuriata_. The adopter was P. Fonteius, a very young man.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: L.

But, in fact, it is only one more\r\nitem in an immense and inconceivable amount of business, that I allow no\r\nletter to reach you from me without its containing some definite sketch\r\nof events and the reflexions arising from it. And in writing to you, as\r\na lover of your country, my first subject will naturally be the state of\r\nthe Republic; next, as I am the nearest object of your affection, I will\r\nalso write about myself, and tell you what I think you will not be\r\nindisposed to know. Well then, in public affairs for the moment the\r\nchief subject of interest is the disturbance in Gaul. For the Ædui--\"our\r\nbrethren\"[123]--have recently fought a losing battle, and the Helvetii\r\nare undoubtedly in arms and making raids upon our province.[124] The\r\nsenate has decreed that the two consuls should draw lots for the Gauls,\r\nthat a levy should be held, all exemptions from service be suspended,\r\nand legates with full powers be sent to visit the states in Gaul, and\r\nsee that they do not join the Helvetii. The legates are Quintus Metellus\r\nCreticus,[125] L. Flaccus,[126] and lastly--a case of \"rich unguent on\r\nlentils\"--Lentulus, son of Clodianus.[127] And while on this subject I\r\ncannot omit mentioning that when among the consulars my name was the\r\nfirst to come up in the ballot, a full meeting of the senate declared\r\nwith one voice that I must be kept in the city. The same occurred to\r\nPompey after me; so that we two appeared to be kept at home as pledges\r\nof the safety of the Republic. Why should I look for the \"bravos\" of\r\nothers when I get these compliments at home? Well, the state of affairs\r\nin the city is as follows. The agrarian law is being vehemently pushed\r\nby the tribune Flavius, with the support of Pompey, but it has nothing\r\npopular about it except its supporter. From this law I, with the full\r\nassent of a public meeting, proposed to omit all clauses which adversely\r\naffected private rights. I proposed to except from its operation such\r\npublic land as had been so in the consulship of P. Mucius and L.\r\nCalpurnius.[128] I proposed to confirm the titles of holders of those to\r\nwhom Sulla had actually assigned lands. I proposed to retain the men of\r\nVolaterræ and Arretium--whose lands Sulla had declared forfeited but\r\nhad not allotted--in their holdings. There was only one section in the\r\nbill that I did not propose to omit, namely, that land should be\r\npurchased with this money from abroad, the proceeds of the new revenues\r\nfor the next five years.[129] But to this whole agrarian scheme the\r\nsenate was opposed, suspecting that some novel power for Pompey was\r\naimed at. Pompey, indeed, had set his heart on getting the law passed.\r\nI, however, with the full approval of the applicants for land,\r\nmaintained the holdings of all private owners--for, as you know, the\r\nlanded gentry form the bulk of our party's forces--while I nevertheless\r\nsatisfied the people and Pompey (for I wanted to do that also) by the\r\npurchase clause; for, if that was put on a sound footing, I thought that\r\ntwo advantages would accrue--the dregs might be drawn from the city, and\r\nthe deserted portions of Italy be repeopled. But this whole business was\r\ninterrupted by the war, and has cooled off. Metellus is an exceedingly\r\ngood consul, and much attached to me. That other one is such a ninny\r\nthat he clearly doesn't know what to do with his purchase.[130] This is\r\nall my public news, unless you regard as touching on public affairs the\r\nfact that a certain Herennius, a tribune, and a fellow tribesman of\r\nyours--a fellow as unprincipled as he is needy--has now begun making\r\nfrequent proposals for transferring P. Clodius to the plebs; he is\r\nvetoed by many of his colleagues. That is really, I think, all the\r\npublic news.\r\n\r\nFor my part, ever since I won what I may call the splendid and immortal\r\nglory of the famous fifth of December[131] (though it was accompanied by\r\nthe jealousy and hostility of many), I have never ceased to play my part\r\nin the Republic in the same lofty spirit, and to maintain the position I\r\nthen inaugurated and took upon myself. But when, first, by the acquittal\r\nof Clodius I clearly perceived the insecurity and rotten state of the\r\nlaw courts; and, secondly, when I saw that it took so little to alienate\r\nmy friends the _publicani_ from the senate--though with me personally\r\nthey had no quarrel; and, thirdly, that the rich (I mean your friends\r\nthe fish-breeders) did not disguise their jealousy of me, I thought I\r\nmust look out for some greater security and stronger support. So, to\r\nbegin with, I have brought the man who had been too long silent on my\r\nachievements, Pompey himself, to such a frame of mind as not once only\r\nin the senate, but many times and in many words, to ascribe to me the\r\npreservation of this empire and of the world. And this was not so\r\nimportant to me--for those transactions are neither so obscure as to\r\nneed testimony, nor so dubious as to need commendation--as to the\r\nRepublic; for there were certain persons base enough to think that some\r\nmisunderstanding would arise between me and Pompey from a difference of\r\nopinion on these measures. With him I have united myself in such close\r\nintimacy that both of us can by this union be better fortified in his\r\nown views, and more secure in his political position. However, the\r\ndislike of the licentious dandies, which had been roused against me, has\r\nbeen so far softened by a conciliatory manner on my part, that they all\r\ncombine to show me marked attention. In fine, while avoiding\r\nchurlishness to anyone, I do not curry favour with the populace or relax\r\nany principle; but my whole course of conduct is so carefully regulated,\r\nthat, while exhibiting an example of firmness to the Republic, in my own\r\nprivate concerns--in view of the instability of the loyalists, the\r\nhostility of the disaffected, and the hatred of the disloyal towards\r\nme--I employ a certain caution and circumspection, and do not allow\r\nmyself, after all, to be involved in these new friendships so far but\r\nthat the famous refrain of the cunning Sicilian frequently sounds in my\r\nears:[132]\r\n\r\n    \"Keep sober and distrust: these wisdom's sinews!\"\r\n\r\nOf my course and way of life, therefore, you see, I think, what may be\r\ncalled a sketch or outline. Of your own business, however, you\r\nfrequently write to me, but I cannot at the moment supply the remedy you\r\nrequire. For that decree of the senate was passed with the greatest\r\nunanimity on the part of the rank and file,[133] though without the\r\nsupport of any of us consulars. For as to your seeing my name at the\r\nfoot of the decree, you can ascertain from the decree itself that the\r\nsubject put to the vote at the time was a different one, and that this\r\nclause about \"free peoples\" was added without good reason. It was done\r\nby P. Servilius the younger,[134] who delivered his vote among the last,\r\nbut it cannot be altered after such an interval of time. Accordingly,\r\nthe meetings, which at first were crowded, have long ceased to be held.\r\nIf you have been able, notwithstanding, by your insinuating address to\r\nget a trifle of money out of the Sicyonians, I wish you would let me\r\nknow.[135] I have sent you an account of my consulship written in Greek.\r\nIf there is anything in it which to a genuine Attic like yourself seems\r\nto be un-Greek or unscholarly, I shall not say as Lucullus said to you\r\n(at Panhormus, was it not?) about his own history, that he had\r\ninterspersed certain barbarisms and solecisms for the express purpose of\r\nproving that it was the work of a Roman. No, if there is anything of\r\nthat sort in my book, it will be without my knowledge and against my\r\nwill. When I have finished the Latin version I will send it to you; and\r\nthirdly, you may expect a poem on the subject, for I would not have any\r\nmethod of celebrating my praise omitted by myself. In this regard pray\r\ndo not quote \"Who will praise his sire?\"[136] For if there is anything\r\nin the world to be preferred to this, let it receive its due meed of\r\npraise, and I mine of blame for not selecting another theme for my\r\npraise. However, what I write is not panegyric but history. My brother\r\nQuintus clears himself to me in a letter, and asserts that he has never\r\nsaid a disparaging word of you to anyone. But this we must discuss face\r\nto face with the greatest care and earnestness: only _do_ come to see me\r\nagain at last! This Cossinius, to whom I intrust my letter, seems to me\r\na very good fellow, steady, devoted to you, and exactly the sort of man\r\nwhich your letter to me had described.\r\n\r\n15 March.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: A special title given to the Ædui on their application\r\nfor alliance.

It is this\r\nletter of yours which I will now proceed to answer. And first let me say\r\nhow glad I am that you have fully understood my appreciation of\r\nyou;[137] and next how excessively rejoiced I am that you have been so\r\nextremely reasonable in regard to those particulars in which you\r\nthought[138] that I and mine had behaved unkindly, or with insufficient\r\nconsideration for your feelings: and this I regard as a proof of no\r\ncommon affection, and of the most excellent judgment and wisdom.\r\nWherefore, since you have written to me in a tone so delightful,\r\nconsiderate, friendly and kind, that I not only have no call to press\r\nyou any farther, but can never even hope to meet from you or any other\r\nman with so much gentleness and good nature, I think the very best\r\ncourse I can pursue is not to say another word on the subject in my\r\nletters. When we meet, if the occasion should arise, we will discuss it\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAs to what you say about politics, your suggestions indeed are both\r\naffectionate and wise, and the course you suggest does not differ\r\nsubstantially from my own policy--for I must neither budge an inch from\r\nthe position imposed upon me by my rank, nor must I without forces of my\r\nown enter the lines of another, while that other, whom you mention in\r\nyour letter, has nothing large-minded about him, nothing lofty, nothing\r\nwhich is not abject and time-serving. However, the course I took was,\r\nafter all, perhaps not ill-calculated for securing the tranquillity of\r\nmy own life; but, by heaven, I did greater service to the Republic than,\r\nby suppressing the attacks of the disloyal, I did to myself, when I\r\nbrought conviction home to the wavering mind of a man of the most\r\nsplendid fortune, influence and popularity, and induced him to\r\ndisappoint the disloyal and praise my acts. Now if I had been forced to\r\nsacrifice consistency in this transaction, I should not have thought\r\nanything worth that price; but the fact is that I have so worked the\r\nwhole business, that I did not seem to be less consistent from my\r\ncomplacency to him, but that he appeared to gain in character by his\r\napprobation of me. In everything else I am so acting, and shall continue\r\nso to act, as to prevent my seeming to have done what I did do by mere\r\nchance. My friends the loyalists, the men at whom you hint, and that\r\n\"Sparta\" which you say has fallen to my lot,[139] I will not only never\r\ndesert, but even if I am deserted by her, I shall still stand by my\r\nancient creed. However, please consider this, that since the death of\r\nCatulus I am holding this road for the loyalists without any garrison or\r\ncompany. For as Rhinton, I think, says:\r\n\r\n    \"Some are stark naught, and some care not at all.\"[140]\r\n\r\nHowever, how our friends the fish-breeders[141] envy me I will write you\r\nword another time, or will reserve it till we meet. But from the\r\nsenate-house nothing shall ever tear me: either because that course is\r\nthe right one, or because it is most to my interests, or because I am\r\nfar from being dissatisfied with the estimation in which I am held by\r\nthe senate.\r\n\r\nAs to the Sicyonians, as I wrote to you before,[142] there is not much\r\nto be hoped for in the senate. For there is no one now to lay a\r\ncomplaint before it. Therefore, if you are waiting for that, you will\r\nfind it a tedious business. Fight some other way if you can. At the time\r\nthe decree was passed no one noticed who would be affected by it, and\r\nbesides the rank and file of the senators voted in a great hurry for\r\nthat clause. For cancelling the senatorial decree the time is not yet\r\nripe, because there are none to complain of it, and because also many\r\nare glad to have it so, some from spite, some from a notion of its\r\nequity. Your friend Metellus is an admirable consul: I have only one\r\nfault to find with him--he doesn't receive the news from Gaul of the\r\nrestoration of peace with much pleasure. He wants a triumph, I suppose.\r\nI could have wished a little less of that sort of thing: in other\r\nrespects he is splendid. But the son of Aulus behaves in such a way,\r\nthat his consulship is not a consulship but a stigma on our friend\r\nMagnus. Of my writings I send you my consulship in Greek completed. I\r\nhave handed that book to L. Cossinius. My Latin works I think you like,\r\nbut as a Greek you envy this Greek book. If others write treatises on\r\nthe subject I will send them to you, but I assure you that, as soon as\r\nthey have read mine, some how or other they become slack. To return to\r\nmy own affairs, L. Papirius Pætus, an excellent man and an admirer of\r\nmine, has presented me with the books left him by Servius Claudius. As\r\nyour friend Cincius told me that I could take them without breaking the\r\n_lex Cincia_[143], I told him that I should have great pleasure in\r\naccepting them, if he brought them to Italy. Wherefore, as you love me,\r\nas you know that I love you, do try by means of friends, clients,\r\nguests, or even your freedmen or slaves, to prevent the loss of a single\r\nleaf. For I am in urgent need of the Greek books which I suspect, and of\r\nthe Latin books which I know, that he left: and more and more every day\r\nI find repose in such studies every moment left to me from my labours in\r\nthe forum. You will, I say, do me a very great favour, if you will be as\r\nzealous in this matter as you ever are in matters in which you suppose\r\nme to feel strongly; and Pætus's own affairs I recommend to your\r\nkindness for which he thanks you extremely. A prompt visit from yourself\r\nis a thing which I do not merely ask for, I advise it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: Contained in Letter XXII, pp. 46-47.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: Reading _tibi_ for _mihi_, as Prof. Tyrrell suggests.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: Σπάρτην ἔλαχες κείνην κοσμεῖ. \"Sparta is your lot, do it\r\ncredit,\" a line of Euripides which had become proverbial.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: οἱ μὲν παρ' οὐδέν εἰσι, τοῖς δ' οὐδεν μέλει.

Metellus's gladiators, your boy met me, and\r\ndelivered to me a letter from you and a history of my consulship written\r\nin Greek.[144] This made me glad that I had some time before delivered\r\nto L. Cossinius a book, also written in Greek, on the same subject, to\r\ntake to you. For if I had read yours first you might have said that I\r\nhad pilfered from you. Although your essay (which I have read with\r\npleasure) seemed to me just a trifle rough and bald, yet its very\r\nneglect of ornament is an ornament in itself, as women were once thought\r\nto have the best perfume who used none. My book, on the other hand, has\r\nexhausted the whole of Isocrates's unguent case, and all the paint-boxes\r\nof his pupils, and even Aristotle's colours. This, as you tell me in\r\nanother letter, you glanced over at Corcyra, and afterwards I suppose\r\nreceived it from Cossinius.[145] I should not have ventured to send it\r\nto you until I had slowly and fastidiously revised it. However,\r\nPosidonius, in his letter of acknowledgment from Rhodes, says that as he\r\nread my memoir, which I had sent him with a view to his writing on the\r\nsame subject with more elaboration, he was not only not incited to\r\nwrite, but absolutely made afraid to do so. In a word, I have routed the\r\nGreeks. Accordingly, as a general rule, those who were pressing me for\r\nmaterial to work up, have now ceased to bother me. Pray, if you like the\r\nbook, see to there being copies at Athens and other Greek towns;[146]\r\nfor it may possibly throw some lustre on my actions. As for my poor\r\nspeeches, I will send you both those you ask for and some more also,\r\nsince what I write to satisfy the studious youth finds favour, it seems,\r\nwith you also. [For it suited my purpose[147]--both because it was in\r\nhis Philippics that your fellow citizen Demosthenes gained his\r\nreputation, and because it was by withdrawing from the mere\r\ncontroversial and forensic style of oratory that he acquired the\r\ncharacter of a serious politician--to see that I too should have\r\nspeeches that may properly be called _consular_. Of these are, first,\r\none delivered on the 1st of January in the senate, a second to the\r\npeople on the agrarian law, a third on Otho, a fourth for Rabirius, a\r\nfifth on the Sons of the Proscribed, a sixth when I declined a province\r\nin public meeting, a seventh when I allowed Catiline to escape, which I\r\ndelivered the day after Catiline fled, a ninth in public meeting on the\r\nday that the Allobroges made their revelation, a tenth in the senate on\r\nthe 5th of December. There are also two short ones, which may be called\r\nfragments, on the agrarian law. This whole cycle I will see that you\r\nhave. And since you like my writings as well as my actions, from these\r\nsame rolls you will learn both what I have done and what I have said--or\r\nyou should not have asked for them, for I did not make you an offer of\r\nthem.]\r\n\r\nYou ask me why I urge you to come home, and at the same time you\r\nintimate that you are hampered by business affairs, and yet say that you\r\nwill nevertheless hasten back, not only if it is needful, but even if I\r\ndesire it. Well, there is certainly no absolute necessity, yet I do\r\nthink you might plan the periods of your tour somewhat more\r\nconveniently. Your absence is too prolonged, especially as you are in a\r\nneighbouring country, while yet I cannot enjoy your society, nor you\r\nmine. For the present there is peace, but if my young friend\r\nPulcher's[148] madness found means to advance a little farther, I should\r\ncertainly summon you from your present sojourn. But Metellus is offering\r\nhim a splendid opposition and will continue to do so. Need I say more?\r\nHe is a truly patriotic consul and, as I have ever thought, naturally an\r\nhonest man. That person, however, makes no disguise, but avowedly\r\ndesires to be elected tribune. But when the matter was mooted in the\r\nsenate, I cut the fellow to pieces, and taunted him with his\r\nchangeableness in seeking the tribuneship at Rome after having given out\r\nat Hera, in Sicily,[149] that he was a candidate for the ædileship; and\r\nwent on to say that we needn't much trouble ourselves, for that he would\r\nnot be permitted to ruin the Republic any more as a plebeian, than\r\npatricians like him had been allowed to do so in my consulship.\r\nPresently, on his saying that he had completed the journey from the\r\nstraits in seven days, and that it was impossible for anyone to have\r\ngone out to meet him, and that he had entered the city by night,[150]\r\nand making a great parade of this in a public meeting, I remarked that\r\nthat was nothing new for him: seven days from Sicily to Rome, three\r\nhours from Rome to Interamna![151] Entered by night, did he? so he did\r\nbefore! No one went to meet him? neither did anyone on the other\r\noccasion, exactly when it should have been done! In short, I bring our\r\nyoung upstart to his bearings, not only by a set and serious speech, but\r\nalso by repartees of this sort. Accordingly, I have come now to rally\r\nhim and jest with him in quite a familiar manner. For instance, when we\r\nwere escorting a candidate, he asked me \"whether I had been accustomed\r\nto secure Sicilians places at the gladiatorial shows?\" \"No,\" said I.\r\n\"Well, I intend to start the practice,\" said he, \"as their new patron;\r\nbut my sister,[152] who has the control of such a large part of the\r\nconsul's space, wont give me more than a single foot.\" \"Don't grumble,\"\r\nsaid I, \"about one of your sister's feet; you may lift the other also.\"\r\nA jest, you will say, unbecoming to a consular. I confess it, but I\r\ndetest that woman--so unworthy of a consul. For\r\n\r\n    \"A shrew she is and with her husband jars,\"\r\n\r\nand not only with Metellus, but also with Fabius,[153] because she is\r\nannoyed at their interference in this business.[154] You ask about the\r\nagrarian law: it has completely lost all interest, I think. You rather\r\nchide me, though gently, about my intimacy with Pompey. I would not have\r\nyou think that I have made friends with him for my own protection; but\r\nthings had come to such a pass that, if by any chance we had quarrelled,\r\nthere would inevitably have been violent dissensions in the state. And\r\nin taking precautions and making provision against that, I by no means\r\nswerved from my well-known loyalist policy, but my object was to make\r\nhim more of a loyalist and induce him to drop somewhat of his\r\ntime-serving vacillation: and he, let me assure you, now speaks in much\r\nhigher terms of my achievements (against which many had tried to incite\r\nhim) than of his own. He testifies that while he served the state well,\r\nI preserved it. What if I even make a better citizen of Cæsar,[155] who\r\nhas now the wind full in his sails--am I doing so poor a service to the\r\nRepublic? Farthermore, if there was no one to envy me, if all, as they\r\nought to be, were my supporters, nevertheless a preference should still\r\nbe given to a treatment that would cure the diseased parts of the state,\r\nrather than to the use of the knife. As it is, however, since the\r\nknighthood, which I once stationed on the slope of the Capitoline,[156]\r\nwith you as their standard-bearer and leader, has deserted the senate,\r\nand since our leading men think themselves in a seventh heaven, if there\r\nare bearded mullets in their fish-ponds that will come to hand for food,\r\nand neglect everything else, do not you think that I am doing no mean\r\nservice if I secure that those who have the power, should not have the\r\nwill, to do any harm? As for our friend Cato, you do not love him more\r\nthan I do: but after all, with the very best intentions and the most\r\nabsolute honesty, he sometimes does harm to the Republic. He speaks and\r\nvotes as though he were in the Republic of Plato, not in the scum of\r\nRomulus. What could be fairer than that a man should be brought to trial\r\nwho has taken a bribe for his verdict? Cato voted for this: the senate\r\nagreed with him. The equites declared war on the senate, not on me, for\r\nI voted against it. What could be a greater piece of impudence than the\r\nequites renouncing the obligations of their contract? Yet for the sake\r\nof keeping the friendship of the order it was necessary to submit to the\r\nloss. Cato resisted and carried his point. Accordingly, though we have\r\nnow had the spectacle of a consul thrown into prison,[157] of riots\r\nagain and again stirred up, not one of those moved a finger to help,\r\nwith whose support I and the consuls that immediately followed me were\r\naccustomed to defend the Republic. \"Well, but,\" say you, \"are we to pay\r\nthem for their support?\" What are we to do if we can't get it on any\r\nother terms? Are we to be slaves to freedmen or even slaves? But, as you\r\nsay, _assez de sérieux!_ Favonius[158] carried my tribe with better\r\ncredit than his own; he lost that of Lucceius. His accusation of\r\nNasica[159] was not creditable, but was conducted with moderation: he\r\nspoke so badly that he appeared when in Rhodes to have ground at the\r\nmills more than at the lessons of Molon.[160] He was somewhat angry\r\nwith me because I appeared for the defence: however, he is now making up\r\nto me again on public grounds. I will write you word how Lucceius is\r\ngetting on when I have seen Cæsar, who will be here in a couple of days.\r\nThe injury done you by the Sicyonians you attribute to Cato and his\r\nimitator Servilius.[161] Why? did not that blow reach many excellent\r\ncitizens? But since the senate has so determined, let us commend it, and\r\nnot be in a minority of one.[162] My \"Amaltheia\"[163] is waiting and\r\nlonging for you. My Tusculan and Pompeian properties please me\r\nimmensely, except that they have overwhelmed me--me, the scourge of\r\ndebt!--not exactly in Corinthian bronze, but in the bronze which is\r\ncurrent in the market.[164] In Gaul I hope peace is restored. My\r\n\"Prognostics,\"[165] along with my poor speeches, expect shortly. Yet\r\nwrite and tell me what your ideas are as to returning. For Pomponia sent\r\na message to me that you would be at Rome some time in July. That does\r\nnot agree with your letter which you wrote to me about your name being\r\nput on the census roll. Pætus, as I have already told you, has presented\r\nme with all books left by his brother. This gift of his depends upon\r\nyour seeing to it with care. Pray, if you love me, take measures for\r\ntheir preservation and transmission to me. You could do me no greater\r\nfavour, and I want the Latin books preserved with as much care as the\r\nGreek. I shall look upon them as virtually a present from yourself. I\r\nhave written to Octavius:[166] I had not said anything to him about you\r\nby word of mouth; for I did not suppose that you carried on your\r\nbusiness in that province, or look upon you in the light of general\r\nmoney-lender: but I have written, as in duty bound, with all\r\nseriousness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: Nep. _Att._ c. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: Atticus seems to have seen a copy belonging to some one\r\nelse at Corfu.

I seem to share his\r\nillness. I am engaged on the \"Constitution of Pellene,\" and, by heaven,\r\nhave piled up a huge heap of Dicæarchus at my feet.[167] What a great\r\nman! You may learn much more from him than from Procilius. His\r\n\"Constitution of Corinth\" and \"Constitution of Athens\" I have, I think,\r\nat Rome. Upon my word, you will say, if you read these, \"What a\r\nremarkable man!\" Herodes, if he had any sense, would have read him\r\nrather than write a single letter himself.[168] He has attacked me by\r\nletter; with you I see he has come to close quarters. I would have\r\njoined a conspiracy rather than resisted one, if I had thought that I\r\nshould have to listen to him as my reward. As to Lollius, you must be\r\nmad. As to the wine, I think you are right.[169] But look here! Don't\r\nyou see that the Kalends are approaching, and no Antonius?[170] That the\r\njury is being empanelled? For so they send me word. That Nigidius[171]\r\nthreatens in public meeting that he will personally cite any juror who\r\ndoes not appear? However, I should be glad if you would write me word\r\nwhether you have heard anything about the return of Antonius; and since\r\nyou don't mean to come here, dine with me in any case on the 29th. Mind\r\nyou do this, and take care of your health.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: The roll being unwound as he read and piled on the\r\nground. Dicæarchus of Messene, a contemporary of Aristotle, wrote on\r\n\"Constitutions\" among other things. Procilius seems also to have written\r\non polities.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: Herodes, a teacher at Athens, afterwards tutor to young\r\nCicero.

Nigidius Figulus, a tribune (which dates the letter\r\nafter the 10th of December). The tribunes had no right of summons\r\n(_vocatio_), they must personally enforce their commands.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII (A II, 3)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (ON HIS WAY TO ROME)\r\n\r\nROME (DECEMBER)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 60, ÆT. 46]\r\n\r\nFirst, I have good news for you, as I think. Valerius has been\r\nacquitted. Hortensius was his counsel. The verdict is thought to have\r\nbeen a favour to Aulus's son; and \"Epicrates,\"[172] I suspect, has been\r\nup to some mischief. I didn't like his boots and his white\r\nleggings.[173] What it is I shall know when you arrive. When you find\r\nfault with the narrow windows, let me tell you that you are criticising\r\nthe Cyropædeia.[174] For when I made the same remark, Cyrus used to\r\nanswer that the views of the gardens through broad lights were not so\r\npleasant. For let α be the eye, βγ the object seen, δ and ε the rays ...\r\nyou see the rest.[175] For if sight resulted from the impact of\r\nimages,[176] the images would be in great difficulties with a narrow\r\nentrance: but, as it is, that \"effusion\" of rays gets on quite nicely.\r\nIf you have any other fault to find you won't get off without an answer,\r\nunless it is something that can be put right without expense.\r\n\r\nI now come to January and my \"political attitude,\" in which, after the\r\nmanner of the Socratics, I shall put the two sides; at the end, however,\r\nas they were wont to do, the one which I approve. It is, indeed, a\r\nmatter for profound reflexion. For I must either firmly oppose the\r\nagrarian law--which will involve a certain struggle, but a struggle full\r\nof glory--or I must remain altogether passive, which is about equivalent\r\nto retiring to Solonium[177] or Antium; or, lastly, I must actually\r\nassist the bill, which I am told Cæsar fully expects from me without any\r\ndoubt. For Cornelius has been with me (I mean Cornelius Balbus,[178]\r\nCæsar's intimate), and solemnly assured me that he meant to avail\r\nhimself of my advice and Pompey's in everything, and intended to\r\nendeavour to reconcile Crassus with Pompey.[179] In this last course\r\nthere are the following advantages: a very close union with Pompey, and,\r\nif I choose, with Cæsar also; a reconciliation with my political\r\nenemies, peace with the common herd, ease for my old age. But the\r\nconclusion of the third book of my own poem has a strong hold on me:\r\n\r\n    \"Meanwhile the tenor of thy youth's first spring,\r\n    Which still as consul thou with all thy soul\r\n    And all thy manhood heldest, see thou keep,\r\n    And swell the chorus of all good men's praise.\"[180]\r\n\r\nThese verses Calliope herself dictated to me in that book, which\r\ncontains much written in an \"aristocratic\" spirit, and I cannot,\r\ntherefore, doubt that I shall always hold that\r\n\r\n    \"The best of omens is our country's cause.\"[181]\r\n\r\nBut let us reserve all this for our walks during the Compitalia[182].\r\nRemember the day before the Compitalia. I will order the bath to be\r\nheated, and Terentia is going to invite Pomponia. We will add your\r\nmother to the party. Please bring me Theophrastus _de Ambitione_ from my\r\nbrother's library.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: \"The Conqueror,\" _i.e._, Pompey. Aulus's son is L.\r\nAfranius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: _I.e._, his military get-up.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: Cyrus was Cicero's architect; his argument or theory he\r\ncalls Cyropædeia, after Xenophon's book.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: He supposes himself to be making a mathematical figure in\r\noptics:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: The theory of sight held by Democritus, denounced as\r\nunphilosophical by Plutarch (_Timoleon_, Introd.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: Apparently a villa in the _Solonius ager_, near\r\nLanuvium.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: The Cornelius Balbus of Gades, whose citizenship Cicero\r\ndefended B.C. 56 (consul B.C. 40). He was Cæsar's close friend and\r\nagent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: Cicero was apparently not behind the scenes. The\r\ncoalition with Pompey certainly, and with Crassus probably, had been\r\nalready made and the terms agreed upon soon after the elections. If\r\nCicero afterwards discovered this it must have shewn him how little he\r\ncould trust Pompey's show of friendship and Cæsar's candour. Cæsar\r\ndesired Cicero's private friendship and public acquiescence, but was\r\nprepared to do without them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: From Cicero's Latin poem on his consulship.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: εἶς οἰωνός ἄριστος ἀμύνεσθαι περὶ πάτρης (Hom. _Il._ xii.\r\n243).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX (Q FR I, 1)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Quintus Cicero was prætor in B.C. 62. In B.C. 61 (March) he went\r\n     out to \"Asia\" as proprætor; his first year of office would be up in\r\n     March, B.C. 60, but his governorship was, as was very common,\r\n     extended till March, B.C. 59. Towards the end of B.C. 60 the senate\r\n     seems to have arranged not to appoint his successor, that is, he\r\n     would be left in office till about March, B.C. 58. It is in view of\r\n     this third year of office that Cicero writes this essay-letter to\r\n     him on the duties of a provincial governor. Apparently Quintus had\r\n     faults of temper which had caused some scandals to reach Rome. We\r\n     have seen how he was one of the few who managed to quarrel with\r\n     Atticus; and in B.C. 48 we shall find how fiercely he resented the\r\n     exercise of his brother's influence which had led him to take the\r\n     losing side, which from his attachment to Cæsar he may have been\r\n     half inclined to think the wrong side. His constant squabbles with\r\n     his wife (though the fault was evidently in great part hers) also\r\n     go towards forming our conclusion about him that, with some ability\r\n     and honesty, he was _un peu difficile_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN ASIA)\r\n\r\nROME (DECEMBER)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 60, ÆT. 46]\r\n\r\nI. Though I have no doubt that many messengers, and even common rumour,\r\nwith its usual speed, will anticipate this letter, and that you will\r\nalready have heard from others that a third year has been added to my\r\nloss and your labour, yet I thought you ought to receive from me also\r\nthe news of this tiresome circumstance. For not in one, but in several\r\nof my previous letters, in spite of others having given up the idea in\r\ndespair, I gave you hope of being able at an early date to quit your\r\nprovince, not only that I might as long as possible cheer you with a\r\npleasurable belief, but also because I and the prætors took such pains\r\nin the matter, that I felt no misgiving as to the possibility of its\r\nbeing arranged. As it is, since matters have so turned out that neither\r\nthe prætors by the weight of their influence, nor I by my earnest\r\nefforts, have been able to prevail, it is certainly difficult not to be\r\nannoyed, yet our minds, practised as they are in conducting and\r\nsupporting business of the utmost gravity, ought not to be crushed or\r\nweakened by vexation. And since men ought to feel most vexed at what has\r\nbeen brought upon them by their own fault, it is I who ought in this\r\nmatter to be more vexed than you. For it is the result of a fault on my\r\npart, against which you had protested both in conversation at the moment\r\nof your departure, and in letters since, that your successor was not\r\nnamed last year. In this, while consulting for the interests of our\r\nallies, and resisting the shameless conduct of some merchants, and while\r\nseeking the increase of our reputation by your virtues, I acted\r\nunwisely, especially as I made it possible for that second year to\r\nentail a third. And as I confess the mistake to have been mine, it lies\r\nwith your wisdom and kindness to remedy it, and to see that my\r\nimprudence is turned to advantage by your careful performance of your\r\nduties. And truly, if you exert yourself in every direction to earn\r\nmen's good word, not with a view to rival others, but henceforth to\r\nsurpass yourself, if you rouse your whole mind and your every thought\r\nand care to the ambition of gaining a superior reputation in all\r\nrespects, believe me, one year added to your labour will bring us, nay,\r\nour posterity also, a joy of many years' duration. Wherefore I begin by\r\nentreating you not to let your soul shrink and be cast down, nor to\r\nallow yourself to be overpowered by the magnitude of the business as\r\nthough by a wave; but, on the contrary, to stand upright and keep your\r\nfooting, or even advance to meet the flood of affairs. For you are not\r\nadministering a department of the state, in which fortune reigns\r\nsupreme, but one in which a well-considered policy and an attention to\r\nbusiness are the most important things. But if I had seen you receiving\r\nthe prolongation of a command in a great and dangerous war, I should\r\nhave trembled in spirit, because I should have known that the dominion\r\nof fortune over us had been at the same time prolonged. As it is,\r\nhowever, a department of the state has been intrusted to you in which\r\nfortune occupies no part, or, at any rate, an insignificant one, and\r\nwhich appears to me to depend entirely on your virtue and self-control.\r\nWe have no reason to fear, as far as I know, any designs of our enemies,\r\nany actual fighting in the field, any revolts of allies, any default in\r\nthe tribute or in the supply of corn, any mutiny in the army: things\r\nwhich have very often befallen the wisest of men in such a way, that\r\nthey have been no more able to get the better of the assault of fortune,\r\nthan the best of pilots a violent tempest. You have been granted\r\nprofound peace, a dead calm: yet if the pilot falls asleep, it may even\r\nso overwhelm him, though if he keeps awake it may give him positive\r\npleasure. For your province consists, in the first place, of allies of a\r\nrace which, of all the world, is the most civilized; and, in the second\r\nplace, of citizens, who, either as being _publicani_, are very closely\r\nconnected with me, or, as being traders who have made money, think that\r\nthey owe the security of their property to my consulship.\r\n\r\nII. But it may be said that among even such men as these there occur\r\nserious disputes, many wrongful acts are committed, and hotly contested\r\nlitigation is the result. As though I ever thought that you had no\r\ntrouble to contend with! I know that the trouble is exceedingly great,\r\nand such as demands the very greatest prudence; but remember that it is\r\nprudence much more than fortune on which, in my opinion, the result of\r\nyour trouble depends. For what trouble is it to govern those over whom\r\nyou are set, if you do but govern yourself? That may be a great and\r\ndifficult task to others, and indeed it is most difficult: to you it has\r\nalways been the easiest thing in the world, and indeed ought to be so,\r\nfor your natural disposition is such that, even without discipline, it\r\nappears capable of self-control; whereas a discipline has, in fact, been\r\napplied that might educate the most faulty of characters. But while you\r\nresist, as you do, money, pleasure, and every kind of desire yourself,\r\nthere will, I am to be told, be a risk of your not being able to\r\nsuppress some fraudulent banker or some rather over-extortionate\r\ntax-collector! For as to the Greeks, they will think, as they behold the\r\ninnocence of your life, that one of the heroes of their history, or a\r\ndemigod from heaven, has come down into the province. And this I say,\r\nnot to induce you to act thus, but to make you glad that you are acting\r\nor have acted so. It is a splendid thing to have been three years in\r\nsupreme power in Asia without allowing statue, picture, plate, napery,\r\nslave, anyone's good looks, or any offer of money--all of which are\r\nplentiful in your province--to cause you to swerve from the most\r\nabsolute honesty and purity of life. What can be imagined so striking or\r\nso desirable as that a virtue, a command over the passions, a\r\nself-control such as yours, are not remaining in darkness and obscurity,\r\nbut have been set in the broad daylight of Asia, before the eyes of a\r\nfamous province, and in the hearing of all nations and peoples? That the\r\ninhabitants are not being ruined by your progresses, drained by your\r\ncharges, agitated by your approach? That there is the liveliest joy,\r\npublic and private, wheresoever you come, the city regarding you as a\r\nprotector and not a tyrant, the private house as a guest and not a\r\nplunderer?\r\n\r\nIII. But in these matters I am sure that mere experience has by this\r\ntime taught you that it is by no means sufficient to have these virtues\r\nyourself, but that you must keep your eyes open and vigilant, in order\r\nthat in the guardianship of your province you may be considered to vouch\r\nto the allies, the citizens, and the state, not for yourself alone, but\r\nfor all the subordinates of your government. However, you have in the\r\npersons of your _legati_ men likely to have a regard for their own\r\nreputation. Of these in rank, position, and age Tubero is first; who, I\r\nthink, particularly as he is a writer of history, could select from his\r\nown Annals many whom he would like and would be able to imitate.\r\nAllienus, again, is ours, as well in heart and affection, as in his\r\nconformity to our principles. I need not speak of Gratidius: I am sure\r\nthat, while taking pains to preserve his own reputation, his fraternal\r\naffection for us makes him take pains for ours also.[183] Your quæstor\r\nis not of your own selection, but the one assigned you by lot. He is\r\nbound both to act with propriety of his own accord, and to conform to\r\nthe policy and principles which you lay down. But should any one of\r\nthese adopt a lower standard of conduct, you should tolerate such\r\nbehaviour, if it goes no farther than a breach, in his private capacity,\r\nof the rules by which he was bound, but not if it goes to the extent of\r\nemploying for gain the authority which you granted him as a promotion.\r\nFor I am far from thinking, especially since the moral sentiments of the\r\nday are so much inclined to excessive laxity and self-seeking, that you\r\nshould investigate every case of petty misconduct, and thoroughly\r\nexamine every one of these persons; but that you should regulate your\r\nconfidence by the trustworthiness of its recipient. And among such\r\npersons you will have to vouch for those whom the Republic has itself\r\ngiven you as companions and assistants in public affairs, at least\r\nwithin the limits which I have before laid down.\r\n\r\nIV. In the case, however, of those of your personal staff or official\r\nattendants whom you have yourself selected to be about you--who are\r\nusually spoken of as a kind of prætor's cohort--we must vouch, not only\r\nfor their acts, but even for their words. But those you have with you\r\nare the sort of men of whom you may easily be fond when they are acting\r\nrightly, and whom you may very easily check when they shew insufficient\r\nregard for your reputation. By these, when you were raw to the work,\r\nyour frank disposition might possibly have been deceived--for the better\r\na man is the less easily does he suspect others of being bad--now,\r\nhowever, let this third year witness an integrity as perfect as the two\r\nformer, but still more wary and vigilant. Listen to that only which you\r\nare supposed to listen to; don't let your ears be open to whispered\r\nfalsehoods and interested suggestions. Don't let your signet ring be a\r\nmere implement, but, as it were, your second self: not the minister of\r\nanother's will, but a witness of your own. Let your marshal hold the\r\nrank which our ancestors wished him to hold, who, looking upon this\r\nplace as not one of profit, but of labour and duty, scarcely ever\r\nconferred it upon any but their freedmen, whom they indeed controlled\r\nalmost as absolutely as their slaves. Let the lictor be the dispenser of\r\nyour clemency, not his own; and let the fasces and axes which they carry\r\nbefore you constitute ensigns rather of rank than of power. Let it, in\r\nfact, be known to the whole province that the life, children, fame, and\r\nfortunes of all over whom you preside are exceedingly dear to you.\r\nFinally, let it be believed that you will, if you detect it, be hostile\r\nnot only to those who have accepted a bribe, but to those also who have\r\ngiven it. And, indeed, no one will give anything, if it is made quite\r\nclear that nothing is usually obtained from you through those who\r\npretend to be very influential with you. Not, however, that the object\r\nof this discourse is to make you over-harsh or suspicious towards your\r\nstaff. For if any of them in the course of the last two years has never\r\nfallen under suspicion of rapacity, as I am told about Cæsius and\r\nChærippus and Labeo--and think it true, because I know them--there is no\r\nauthority, I think, which may not be intrusted to them, and no\r\nconfidence which may not be placed in them with the utmost propriety,\r\nand in anyone else like them. But if there is anyone of whom you have\r\nalready had reason to doubt, or concerning whom you have made some\r\ndiscovery, in such a man place no confidence, intrust him with no\r\nparticle of your reputation.\r\n\r\nV. If, however, you have found in the province itself anyone, hitherto\r\nunknown to us, who has made his way into intimacy with you, take care\r\nhow much confidence you repose in him; not that there may not be many\r\ngood provincials, but, though we may hope so, it is risky to be\r\npositive. For everyone's real character is covered by many wrappings of\r\npretence and is concealed by a kind of veil: face, eyes, expression very\r\noften lie, speech most often of all. Wherefore, how can you expect to\r\nfind in that class[184] any who, while foregoing for the sake of money\r\nall from which we can scarcely tear ourselves away,[185] will yet love\r\nyou sincerely and not merely pretend to do so from interested motives? I\r\nthink, indeed, it is a hard task to find such men, especially if we\r\nnotice that the same persons care nothing for almost any man out of\r\noffice, yet always with one consent shew affection for the prætors. But\r\nof this class, if by chance you have discovered any one to be fonder of\r\nyou--for it may so happen--than of your office, such a man indeed gladly\r\nadmit upon your list of friends: but if you fail to perceive that,\r\nthere is no class of people you must be more on your guard against\r\nadmitting to intimacy, just because they are acquainted with all the\r\nways of making money, do everything for the sake of it, and have no\r\nconsideration for the reputation of a man with whom they are not\r\ndestined to pass their lives. And even among the Greeks themselves you\r\nmust be on your guard against admitting close intimacies, except in the\r\ncase of the very few, if such are to be found, who are worthy of ancient\r\nGreece. As things now stand, indeed, too many of them are untrustworthy,\r\nfalse, and schooled by long servitude in the arts of extravagant\r\nadulation. My advice is that these men should all be entertained with\r\ncourtesy, but that close ties of hospitality or friendship should only\r\nbe formed with the best of them: excessive intimacies with them are not\r\nvery trustworthy--for they do not venture to oppose our wishes--and they\r\nare not only jealous of our countrymen, but of their own as well.\r\n\r\nVI. And now, considering the caution and care that I would shew in\r\nmatters of this kind--in which I fear I may be somewhat\r\nover-severe--what do you suppose my sentiments are in regard to slaves?\r\nUpon these we ought to keep a hold in all places, but especially in the\r\nprovinces. On this head many rules may be laid down, but this is at once\r\nthe shortest and most easily maintained--that they should behave during\r\nyour progresses in Asia as though you were travelling on the Appian way,\r\nand not suppose that it makes any difference whether they have arrived\r\nat Tralles or Formiæ. But if, again, any one of your slaves is\r\nconspicuously trustworthy, employ him in your domestic and private\r\naffairs; but in affairs pertaining to your office as governor, or in any\r\ndepartment of the state, do not let him lay a finger. For many things\r\nwhich may, with perfect propriety, be intrusted to slaves, must yet not\r\nbe so intrusted, for the sake of avoiding talk and hostile remark. But\r\nmy discourse, I know not how, has slipped into the didactic vein, though\r\nthat is not what I proposed to myself originally. For what right have I\r\nto be laying down rules for one who, I am fully aware, in this subject\r\nespecially, is not my inferior in wisdom, while in experience he is even\r\nmy superior? Yet, after all, if your actions had the additional weight\r\nof my approval, I thought that they would seem more satisfactory to\r\nyourself. Wherefore, let these be the foundations on which your public\r\ncharacter rests: first and foremost your own honesty and self-control,\r\nthen the scrupulous conduct of all your staff, the exceedingly cautious\r\nand careful selection in regard to intimacies with provincials and\r\nGreeks, the strict and unbending government of your slaves. These are\r\ncreditable even in the conduct of our private and everyday business: in\r\nsuch an important government, where morals are so debased and the\r\nprovince has such a corrupting influence, they must needs seem divine.\r\nSuch principles and conduct on your part are sufficient to justify the\r\nstrictness which you have displayed in some acts of administration,\r\nowing to which I have encountered certain personal disputes with great\r\nsatisfaction, unless, indeed, you suppose me to be annoyed by the\r\ncomplaints of a fellow like Paconius--who is not even a Greek, but in\r\nreality a Mysian or Phrygian--or by the words of Tuscenius, a madman and\r\na knave, from whose abominable jaws you snatched the fruits of a most\r\ninfamous piece of extortion with the most complete justice.\r\n\r\nVII. These and similar instances of your strict administration in your\r\nprovince we shall find difficulty in justifying, unless they are\r\naccompanied by the most perfect integrity: wherefore let there be the\r\ngreatest strictness in your administration of justice, provided only\r\nthat it is never varied from favour, but is kept up with impartiality.\r\nBut it is of little avail that justice is administered by yourself with\r\nimpartiality and care, unless the same is done by those to whom you have\r\nintrusted any portion of this duty. And, indeed, in my view there is no\r\nvery great variety of business in the government of Asia: the entire\r\nprovince mainly depends on the administration of justice. In it we have\r\nthe whole theory of government, especially of provincial government,\r\nclearly displayed: all that a governor has to do is to shew consistency\r\nand firmness enough, not only to resist favouritism, but even the\r\nsuspicion of it. To this also must be added courtesy in listening to\r\npleaders, consideration in pronouncing a decision, and painstaking\r\nefforts to convince suitors of its justice, and to answer their\r\narguments. It is by such habits that C. Octavius has recently made\r\nhimself very popular;[186] in whose court, for the first time,[187] the\r\nlictor did not interfere, and the marshal kept silence, while every\r\nsuitor spoke as often and as long as he chose. In which conduct he would\r\nperhaps have been thought over-lax, had it not been that this laxity\r\nenabled him to maintain the following instance of severity. The\r\npartisans of Sulla were forced to restore what they had taken by\r\nviolence and terrorism. Those who had made inequitable decrees, while in\r\noffice, were now as private citizens forced to submit to the principles\r\nthey had established. This strictness on his part would have been\r\nthought harsh, had it not been rendered palatable by many sweetening\r\ninfluences of courtesy. But if this gentleness was sufficient to make\r\nhim popular at Rome, where there is such haughtiness of spirit, such\r\nunrestrained liberty, such unlimited licence of individuals, and, in\r\nfine, so many magistrates, so many means of obtaining protection, such\r\nvast power in the hands of the popular assembly, and such influence\r\nexercised by the senate, how welcome must a prætor's courtesy be in\r\nAsia, in which there is such a numerous body of citizens and allies, so\r\nmany cities, so many communities, all hanging on one man's nod, and in\r\nwhich there are no means of protection, no one to whom to make a\r\ncomplaint, no senate, no popular assembly! Wherefore it requires an\r\nexalted character, a man who is not only equitable from natural impulse,\r\nbut who has also been trained by study and the refinements of a liberal\r\neducation, so to conduct himself while in the possession of such immense\r\npower, that those over whom he rules should not feel the want of any\r\nother power.\r\n\r\nVIII. Take the case of the famous Cyrus, portrayed by Xenophon, not as\r\nan historical character, but as a model of righteous government, the\r\nserious dignity of whose character is represented by that philosopher as\r\ncombined with a peculiar courtesy. And, indeed, it is not without reason\r\nthat our hero Africanus used perpetually to have those books in his\r\nhands, for there is no duty pertaining to a careful and equitable\r\ngovernor which is not to be found in them. Well, if _he_ cultivated\r\nthose qualities, though never destined to be in a private station, how\r\ncarefully ought those to maintain them to whom power is given with the\r\nunderstanding that it must be surrendered, and given by laws under whose\r\nauthority they must once more come? In my opinion all who govern others\r\nare bound to regard as the object of all their actions the greatest\r\nhappiness of the governed. That this is your highest object, and has\r\nbeen so since you first landed in Asia, has been published abroad by\r\nconsistent rumour and the conversation of all. It is, let me add, not\r\nonly the duty of one who governs allies and citizens, but even of one\r\nwho governs slaves and dumb animals, to serve the interests and\r\nadvantage of those under him. In this point I notice that everyone\r\nagrees that you take the greatest pains: no new debt is being contracted\r\nby the states, while many have been relieved by you from a heavy and\r\nlong-standing one. Several cities that had become dilapidated and almost\r\ndeserted--of which one was the most famous state in Ionia, the other in\r\nCaria, Samus and Halicarnassus--have been given a new life by you: there\r\nis no party fighting, no civil strife in the towns: you take care that\r\nthe government of the states is administered by the best class of\r\ncitizens: brigandage is abolished in Mysia; murder suppressed in many\r\ndistricts; peace is established throughout the province; and not only\r\nthe robberies usual on highways and in country places, but those more\r\nnumerous and more serious ones in towns and temples, have been\r\ncompletely stopped: the fame, fortunes, and repose of the rich have been\r\nrelieved of that most oppressive instrument of prætorial\r\nrapacity--vexatious prosecution; the expenses and tribute of the states\r\nare made to fall with equal weight on all who live in the territories of\r\nthose states: access to you is as easy as possible: your ears are open\r\nto the complaints of all: no man's want of means or want of friends\r\nexcludes him, I don't say from access to you in public and on the\r\ntribunal, but even from your house and chamber: in a word, throughout\r\nyour government there is no harshness or cruelty--everywhere clemency,\r\nmildness, and kindness reign supreme.\r\n\r\nIX. What an immense benefit, again, have you done in having liberated\r\nAsia from the tribute exacted by the ædiles a measure which cost me some\r\nviolent controversies! For if one of our nobles complains openly that\r\nby your edict, \"No moneys shall be voted for the games,\" you have robbed\r\nhim of 200 sestertia, what a vast sum of money would have been paid, had\r\na grant been made to the credit of every magistrate who held games, as\r\nhad become the regular custom! However, I stopped these complaints by\r\ntaking up this position--what they think of it in Asia I don't know, in\r\nRome it meets with no little approval and praise--I refused to accept a\r\nsum of money which the states had decreed for a temple and monument in\r\nour honour, though they had done so with the greatest enthusiasm in view\r\nboth of my services and of your most valuable benefactions; and though\r\nthe law contained a special and distinct exception in these words, \"that\r\nit was lawful to receive for temple or monument\"; and though again the\r\nmoney was not going to be thrown away, but would be employed on\r\ndecorating a temple, and would thus appear to have been given to the\r\nRoman people and the immortal Gods rather than to myself--yet, in spite\r\nof its having desert, law, and the wishes of those who offered the gift\r\nin its favour, I determined that I must not accept it, for this reason\r\namong others, namely, to prevent those, to whom such an honour was\r\nneither due nor legal, from being jealous. Wherefore adhere with all\r\nyour heart and soul to the policy which you have hitherto adopted--that\r\nof being devoted to those whom the senate and people of Rome have\r\ncommitted and intrusted to your honour and authority, of doing your best\r\nto protect them, and of desiring their greatest happiness. Even if the\r\nlot had made you governor of Africans, or Spaniards, or\r\nGauls--uncivilized and barbarous nations--it would still have been your\r\nduty as a man of feeling to consult for their interests and advantage,\r\nand to have contributed to their safety. But when we rule over a race of\r\nmen in which civilization not only exists, but from which it is believed\r\nto have spread to others, we are bound to repay them, above all things,\r\nwhat we received from them. For I shall not be ashamed to go so\r\nfar--especially as my life and achievements have been such as to exclude\r\nany suspicion of sloth or frivolity--as to confess that, whatever I have\r\naccomplished, I have accomplished by means of those studies and\r\nprinciples which have been transmitted to us in Greek literature and\r\nschools of thought. Wherefore, over and above the general good faith\r\nwhich is due to all men, I think we are in a special sense under an\r\nobligation to that nation, to put in practice what it has taught us\r\namong the very men by whose maxims we have been brought out of\r\nbarbarism.\r\n\r\nX. And indeed Plato, the fountain-head of genius and learning, thought\r\nthat states would only be happy when scholars and philosophers began\r\nbeing their rulers, or when those who were their rulers had devoted all\r\ntheir attention to learning and philosophy. It was plainly this union of\r\npower and philosophy that in his opinion might prove the salvation of\r\nstates. And this perhaps has at length fallen to the fortune of the\r\nwhole empire: certainly it has in the present instance to your province,\r\nto have a man in supreme power in it, who has from boyhood spent the\r\nchief part of his zeal and time in imbibing the principles of\r\nphilosophy, virtue, and humanity. Wherefore be careful that this third\r\nyear, which has been added to your labour, may be thought a prolongation\r\nof prosperity to Asia. And since Asia was more fortunate in retaining\r\nyou than I was in my endeavour to bring you back, see that my regret is\r\nsoftened by the exultation of the province. For if you have displayed\r\nthe very greatest activity in earning honours such as, I think, have\r\nnever been paid to anyone else, much greater ought your activity to be\r\nin preserving these honours. What I for my part think of honours of that\r\nkind I have told you in previous letters. I have always regarded them,\r\nif given indiscriminately, as of little value, if paid from interested\r\nmotives, as worthless: if, however, as in this case, they are tributes\r\nto solid services on your part, I hold you bound to take much pains in\r\npreserving them. Since, then, you are exercising supreme power and\r\nofficial authority in cities, in which you have before your eyes the\r\nconsecration and apotheosis of your virtues, in all decisions, decrees,\r\nand official acts consider what you owe to those warm opinions\r\nentertained of you, to those verdicts on your character, to those\r\nhonours which have been rendered you. And what you owe will be to\r\nconsult for the interests of all, to remedy men's misfortunes, to\r\nprovide for their safety, to resolve that you will be both called and\r\nbelieved to be the \"father of Asia.\"\r\n\r\nXI. However, to such a resolution and deliberate policy on your part the\r\ngreat obstacle are the _publicani_: for, if we oppose them, we shall\r\nalienate from ourselves and from the Republic an order which has done us\r\nmost excellent service, and which has been brought into sympathy with\r\nthe Republic by our means; if, on the other hand, we comply with them in\r\nevery case, we shall allow the complete ruin of those whose interests,\r\nto say nothing of their preservation, we are bound to consult. This is\r\nthe one difficulty, if we look the thing fairly in the face, in your\r\nwhole government. For disinterested conduct on one's own part, the\r\nsuppression of all inordinate desires, the keeping a check upon one's\r\nstaff, courtesy in hearing causes, in listening to and admitting\r\nsuitors--all this is rather a question of credit than of difficulty: for\r\nit does not depend on any special exertion, but rather on a mental\r\nresolve and inclination. But how much bitterness of feeling is caused to\r\nallies by that question of the _publicani_ we have had reason to know in\r\nthe case of citizens who, when recently urging the removal of the\r\nport-dues in Italy, did not complain so much of the dues themselves, as\r\nof certain extortionate conduct on the part of the collectors.\r\nWherefore, after hearing the grievances of citizens in Italy, I can\r\ncomprehend what happens to allies in distant lands. To conduct oneself\r\nin this matter in such a way as to satisfy the _publicani_, especially\r\nwhen contracts have been undertaken at a loss, and yet to preserve the\r\nallies from ruin, seems to demand a virtue with something divine in it,\r\nI mean a virtue like yours. To begin with, that they are subject to tax\r\nat all, which is their greatest grievance, ought not to be thought so by\r\nthe Greeks, because they were so subject by their own laws without the\r\nRoman government. Again, they cannot despise the word _publicanus_, for\r\nthey have been unable to pay the assessment according to Sulla's\r\npoll-tax without the aid of the publican. But that Greek _publicani_ are\r\nnot more considerate in exacting the payment of taxes than our own may\r\nbe gathered from the fact that the Caunii, and all the islands assigned\r\nto the Rhodians by Sulla, recently appealed to the protection of the\r\nsenate, and petitioned to be allowed to pay their tax to us rather than\r\nto the Rhodians. Wherefore neither ought those to revolt at the name of\r\na _publicanus_ who have always been subject to tax, nor those to despise\r\nit who have been unable to make up the tribute by themselves, nor those\r\nto refuse his services who have asked for them. At the same time let\r\nAsia reflect on this, that if she were not under our government, there\r\nis no calamity of foreign war or internal strife from which she would be\r\nfree. And since that government cannot possibly be maintained without\r\ntaxes, she should be content to purchase perpetual peace and\r\ntranquillity at the price of a certain proportion of her products.\r\n\r\nXII. But if they will fairly reconcile themselves to the existence and\r\nname of publican, all the rest may be made to appear to them in a less\r\noffensive light by your skill and prudence. They may, in making their\r\nbargains with the _publicani_, not have regard so much to the exact\r\nconditions laid down by the censors as to the convenience of settling\r\nthe business and freeing themselves from farther trouble. You also may\r\ndo, what you have done splendidly and are still doing, namely, dwell on\r\nthe high position of the _publicani_, and on your obligations to that\r\norder, in such a way as--putting out of the question all considerations\r\nof your _imperium_ and the power of your official authority and\r\ndignity--to reconcile the Greeks with the _publicani_, and to beg of\r\nthose, whom you have served eminently well, and who owe you everything,\r\nto suffer you by their compliance to maintain and preserve the bonds\r\nwhich unite us with the _publicani_. But why do I address these\r\nexhortations to you, who are not only capable of carrying them out of\r\nyour own accord without anyone's instruction, but have already to a\r\ngreat extent thoroughly done so? For the most respectable and important\r\ncompanies do not cease offering me thanks daily, and this is all the\r\nmore gratifying to me because the Greeks do the same. Now it is an\r\nachievement of great difficulty to unite in feeling things which are\r\nopposite in interests, aims, and, I had almost said, in their very\r\nnature. But I have not written all this to instruct you--for your wisdom\r\nrequires no man's instruction--but it has been a pleasure to me while\r\nwriting to set down your virtues, though I have run to greater length in\r\nthis letter than I could have wished, or than I thought I should.\r\n\r\nXIII. There is one thing on which I shall not cease from giving you\r\nadvice, nor will I, as far as in me lies, allow your praise to be spoken\r\nof with a reservation. For all who come from your province do make one\r\nreservation in the extremely high praise which they bestow on your\r\nvirtue, integrity, and kindness--it is that of sharpness of temper. That\r\nis a fault which, even in our private and everyday life, seems to\r\nindicate want of solidity and strength of mind; but nothing, surely, can\r\nbe more improper than to combine harshness of temper with the exercise\r\nof supreme power. Wherefore I will not undertake to lay before you now\r\nwhat the greatest philosophers say about anger, for I should not wish to\r\nbe tedious, and you can easily ascertain it yourself from the writings\r\nof many of them: but I don't think I ought to pass over what is the\r\nessence of a letter, namely, that the recipient should be informed of\r\nwhat he does not know. Well, what nearly everybody reports to me is\r\nthis: they usually say that, as long as you are not out of temper,\r\nnothing can be pleasanter than you are, but that when some instance of\r\ndishonesty or wrong-headedness has stirred you, your temper rises to\r\nsuch a height that no one can discover any trace of your usual kindness.\r\nWherefore, since no mere desire for glory, but circumstances and fortune\r\nhave brought us upon a path of life which makes it inevitable that men\r\nwill always talk about us, let us be on our guard, to the utmost of our\r\nmeans and ability, that no glaring fault may be alleged to have existed\r\nin us. And I am not now urging, what is perhaps difficult in human\r\nnature generally, and at our time of life especially, that you should\r\nchange your disposition and suddenly pluck out a deeply-rooted habit,\r\nbut I give you this hint: if you cannot completely avoid this failing,\r\nbecause your mind is surprised by anger before cool calculation has been\r\nable to prevent it, deliberately prepare yourself beforehand, and daily\r\nreflect on the duty of resisting anger, and that, when it moves your\r\nheart most violently, it is just the time for being most careful to\r\nrestrain your tongue. And that sometimes seems to me to be a greater\r\nvirtue than not being angry at all. For the latter is not always a mark\r\nof superiority to weakness, it is sometimes the result of dullness; but\r\nto govern temper and speech, however angry you may be, or even to hold\r\nyour tongue and keep your indignant feelings and resentment under\r\ncontrol, although it may not be a proof of perfect wisdom, yet requires\r\nno ordinary force of character. And, indeed, in this respect they tell\r\nme that you are now much more gentle and less irritable. No violent\r\noutbursts of indignation on your part, no abusive words, no insulting\r\nlanguage are reported to me: which, while quite alien to culture and\r\nrefinement, are specially unsuited to high power and place. For if your\r\nanger is implacable, it amounts to extreme harshness; if easily\r\nappeased, to extreme weakness. The latter, however, as a choice of\r\nevils, is, after all, preferable to harshness.\r\n\r\nXIV. But since your first year gave rise to most talk in regard to this\r\nparticular complaint--I believe because the wrong-doing, the\r\ncovetousness, and the arrogance of men came upon you as a surprise, and\r\nseemed to you unbearable --while your second year was much milder,\r\nbecause habit and reflexion, and, as I think, my letters also, rendered\r\nyou more tolerant and gentle, the third ought to be so completely\r\nreformed, as not to give even the smallest ground for anyone to find\r\nfault. And here I go on to urge upon you, not by way of exhortation or\r\nadmonition, but by brotherly entreaties, that you would set your whole\r\nheart, care, and thought on the gaining of praise from everybody and\r\nfrom every quarter. If, indeed, our achievements were only the subject\r\nof a moderate amount of talk and commendation, nothing eminent, nothing\r\nbeyond the practice of others, would have been demanded of you. As it\r\nis, however, owing to the brilliancy and magnitude of the affairs in\r\nwhich we have been engaged, if we do not obtain the very highest\r\nreputation from your province, it seems scarcely possible for us to\r\navoid the most violent abuse. Our position is such that all loyalists\r\nsupport us, but demand also and expect from us every kind of activity\r\nand virtue, while all the disloyal, seeing that we have entered upon a\r\nlasting war with them, appear contented with the very smallest excuse\r\nfor attacking us. Wherefore, since fortune has allotted to you such a\r\ntheatre as Asia, completely packed with an audience, of immense size, of\r\nthe most refined judgment, and, moreover, naturally so capable of\r\nconveying sound, that its expressions of opinion and its remarks reach\r\nRome, put out all your power, I beseech you, exert all your energies to\r\nappear not only to have been worthy of the part we played here, but to\r\nhave surpassed everything done there by your high qualities.\r\n\r\nXV. And since chance has assigned to me among the magistracies the\r\nconduct of public business in the city, to you that in a province, if my\r\nshare is inferior to no one's, take care that yours surpasses others. At\r\nthe same time think of this: we are not now working for a future and\r\nprospective glory, but are fighting in defence of what has been already\r\ngained; which indeed it was not so much an object to gain as it is now\r\nour duty to defend. And if anything in me could be apart from you, I\r\nshould desire nothing more than the position which I have already\r\ngained. The actual fact, however, is that unless all your acts and deeds\r\nin your province correspond to my achievements, I shall think that I\r\nhave gained nothing by those great labours and dangers, in all of which\r\nyou have shared. But if it was you who, above all others, assisted me to\r\ngain a most splendid reputation, you will certainly also labour more\r\nthan others to enable me to retain it. You must not be guided by the\r\nopinions and judgments of the present generation only, but of those to\r\ncome also: and yet the latter will be a more candid judgment, for it\r\nwill not be influenced by detraction and malice. Finally, you should\r\nthink of this--that you are not seeking glory for yourself alone (and\r\neven if that were the case, you still ought not to be careless of it,\r\nespecially as you had determined to consecrate the memory of your name\r\nby the most splendid monuments), but you have to share it with me, and\r\nto hand it down to our children. In regard to which you must be on your\r\nguard lest by any excess of carelessness you should seem not only to\r\nhave neglected your own interests, but to have begrudged those of your\r\nfamily also.\r\n\r\nXVI. And these observations are not made with the idea of any speech of\r\nmine appearing to have roused you from your sleep, but to have rather\r\n\"added speed to the runner.\" For you will continue to compel all in the\r\nfuture, as you have compelled them in the past, to praise your equity,\r\nself-control, strictness, and honesty. But from my extreme affection I\r\nam possessed with a certain insatiable greed for glory for you. However,\r\nI am convinced that, as Asia should now be as well-known to you as each\r\nman's own house is to himself, and since to your supreme good sense such\r\ngreat experience has now been added, there is nothing that affects\r\nreputation which you do not know as well as possible yourself, and\r\nwhich does not daily occur to your mind without anybody's exhortation.\r\nBut I, who when I read your writing seem to hear your voice, and when I\r\nwrite to you seem to be talking to you, am therefore always best pleased\r\nwith your longest letter, and in writing am often somewhat prolix\r\nmyself. My last prayer and advice to you is that, as good poets and\r\npainstaking actors always do, so you should be most attentive in the\r\nlast scenes and conclusion of your function and business, so that this\r\nthird year of your government, like a third act in a play, may appear to\r\nhave been the most elaborated and most highly finished. You will do that\r\nwith more ease if you will think that I, whom you always wished to\r\nplease more than all the world besides, am always at your side, and am\r\ntaking part in everything you say and do. It remains only to beg you to\r\ntake the greatest care of your health, if you wish me and all your\r\nfriends to be well also.\r\n\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: A country festival and general holiday.

Coss., C. Iulius Cæsar, M. Calpurnius Bibulus.]\r\n\r\n     This year was a crucial one in the history of the Republic, and\r\n     also of Cicero particularly. It witnessed the working of the\r\n     agreement entered into in the previous year between Pompey, Cæsar,\r\n     and Crassus, to secure their several objects, commonly called the\r\n     First Triumvirate. The determined enmity of the consuls to each\r\n     other, the high-handed conduct of Cæsar in regard to the senate,\r\n     his ultimate appointment to the unusual period of five years'\r\n     government of the Gauls and Illyricum, were so many blows at the\r\n     old constitution; and scarcely less offensive to the Catonian\r\n     Optimates were the agrarian laws passed in favour of Pompey's\r\n     veterans, the forcing of his _acta_ through the senate, and the\r\n     arrangement whereby he too was eventually to have the consulship\r\n     again, and an extended period of provincial government. Cicero was\r\n     distracted by hesitation. He had pinned his faith on Pompey's\r\n     ultimate opposition to Cæsar, and yet did not wholly trust him, and\r\n     was fully aware of the unpracticable nature of Cato and the\r\n     weakness of the Optimates. The triumvirs had an instrument for\r\n     rendering him helpless in Clodius, but Cicero could not believe\r\n     that they would use it, or that his services to the state could be\r\n     so far forgotten as to make danger possible. We shall find him,\r\n     then, wholly absorbed in the question as to how far he is to give\r\n     into or oppose the triumvirs. It is not till the end of the year\r\n     that he begins to see the real danger ahead. We have one extant\r\n     oration of this year--_pro Flacco_--which was not much to his\r\n     credit, for Flaccus had evidently been guilty of extortion in Asia.\r\n     He also defended the equally guilty C. Antonius in a speech which\r\n     brought upon him the vengeance of the triumvirs, but it is happily\r\n     lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTUSCULUM (APRIL)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 59, ÆT. 47]\r\n\r\nI am exceedingly obliged to you for sending me Serapio's book, of which\r\nindeed, between you and me, I scarcely understood a thousandth part. I\r\nhave ordered the money for it to be paid you at once, that you may not\r\nput it down to the cost of presentation copies. But as I have mentioned\r\nthe subject of money, I will beg you to try to come to a settlement with\r\nTitinius in any way you can. If he doesn't stand by his own proposal,\r\nwhat I should like best is that what he bought at too dear a rate should\r\nbe returned, if that can be done with Pomponia's consent: if that too is\r\nimpossible, let the money be paid rather than have any difficulty. I\r\nshould be very glad if you would settle this before you leave Rome, with\r\nyour usual kindness and exactness.\r\n\r\nSo Clodius, you say, is for Tigranes? I only wish he would go--on the\r\nsame terms as the Skepsian![188] But I don't grudge him the job; for a\r\nmore convenient time for my taking a \"free legation\" is when my brother\r\nQuintus shall have settled down again, as I hope, into private life, and\r\nI shall have made certain how that \"priest of the Bona Dea\"[189] intends\r\nto behave. Meanwhile I shall find my pleasure in the Muses with a mind\r\nundisturbed, or rather glad and cheerful; for it will never occur to me\r\nto envy Crassus or to regret that I have not been false to myself. As to\r\ngeography, I will try to satisfy you, but I promise nothing for\r\ncertain.[190] It is a difficult business, but nevertheless, as you bid\r\nme, I will take care that this country excursion produces something for\r\nyou. Mind you let me know any news you have ferreted out, and especially\r\nwho you think will be the next consuls. However, I am not very curious;\r\nfor I have determined not to think about politics. I have examined\r\nTerentia's woodlands. What need I say? If there was only a Dodonean oak\r\nin them, I should imagine myself to be in possession of Epirus. About\r\nthe 1st of the month I shall be either at Formiæ or Pompeii.[191] If I\r\nam not at Formiæ, pray, an you love me, come to Pompeii. It will be a\r\ngreat pleasure to me and not much out of the way for you. About the\r\nwall, I have given Philotimus orders not to put any difficulty in the\r\nway of your doing whatever you please. I think, however, you had better\r\ncall in Vettius.[192] In these bad times, when the life of all the best\r\nmen hangs on a thread, I value one summer's enjoyment of my Palatine\r\n_palæstra_ rather highly; but, of course, the last thing I should wish\r\nwould be that Pomponia and her boy should live in fear of a falling\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: That is, if it ends in his death, for Meliodorus of\r\nSkepsis was sent by Mithridates to Tigranes to urge him to go to war\r\nwith Rome, but privately advised him not to do so, and, in consequence,\r\nwas put to death by Mithridates (Plut. _Luc._ 22). The word _Scepsii_\r\n(Σκηψίου) was introduced by Gronovius for the unintelligible word\r\n_Syrpie_ found in the MSS., which so often blunder in Greek names.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: Clodius, alluding to his intrusion into the mysteries.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: Atticus has asked Cicero for a Latin treatise on\r\ngeography--probably as a publisher, Cicero being the prince of\r\nbook-makers--and to that end has sent him the Greek geography of\r\nSerapio.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: In his Formianum or Pompeianum, his villas at Formiæ and\r\nPompeii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: An architect, a freedman of Cyrus, of whom we have heard\r\nbefore.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI (A II, 5)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nANTIUM (APRIL)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 59, ÆT. 47]\r\n\r\nI wish very much, and have long wished, to visit Alexandria, and at the\r\nsame time to get away from here, where people are tired of me, and\r\nreturn when they have begun to feel my loss--but at such a time and at\r\nthe bidding of such statesmen![193]\r\n\r\n    \"I fear to face the men of Troy\r\n    And Trojan matrons with their trailing robes.\"[194]\r\n\r\nFor what would my friends the Optimates say--if there are such persons\r\nleft? That I had accepted a bribe to change my views?\r\n\r\n    \"Polydamas the first would lay the charge.\"\r\n\r\nI mean my friend Cato, who is as good as a hundred thousand in my eyes.\r\nWhat, too, will history say of me six hundred years hence? I am much\r\nmore afraid of that than of the petty gossip of the men of to-day. But,\r\nI think, I had better lie low and wait. For if it is really offered to\r\nme, I shall be to a certain extent in a position of advantage, and then\r\nwill be the time to weigh the matter. There is, upon my word, a certain\r\ncredit even in refusing. Wherefore, if Theophanes[195] by chance has\r\nconsulted you on the matter, do not absolutely decline. What I am\r\nexpecting to hear from you is, what Arrius says, and how he endures\r\nbeing left in the lurch,[196] and who are intended to be consuls--is it\r\nPompey and Crassus, or, as I am told in a letter, Servius Sulpicius with\r\nGabinius?--and whether there are any new laws or anything new at all;\r\nand, since Nepos[197] is leaving Rome, who is to have the augurship--the\r\none bait by which those personages could catch me! You see what a high\r\nprice I put on myself! Why do I talk about such things, which I am eager\r\nto throw aside, and to devote myself heart and soul to philosophy. That,\r\nI tell you, is my intention. I could wish I had done so from the first.\r\nNow, however, that I have found by experience the hollowness of what I\r\nthought so splendid, I am thinking of doing business exclusively with\r\nthe Muses. In spite of that, please give me in your next some more\r\ndefinite information about Curtius and who is intended to fill his\r\nplace, and what is doing about P. Clodius, and, in fact, take your time\r\nand tell me everything as you promise; and pray write me word what day\r\nyou think of leaving Rome, in order that I may tell you where I am\r\nlikely to be: and send me a letter at once on the subjects of which I\r\nhave written to you. I look forward much to hearing from you.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: The triumvirs.

Accordingly, I either enjoy myself with books, of which I\r\nhave a delightful stock at Antium, or I just count the waves--for the\r\nrough weather prevents my shrimping! From writing my mind positively\r\nrecoils. For the geographical treatise, upon which I had settled, is a\r\nserious undertaking: so severely is Eratosthenes, whom I had proposed as\r\nmy model, criticised by Serapio and Hipparchus: what think you will be\r\nthe case if Tyrannio[198] is added to the critics? And, by Hercules, the\r\nsubject is difficult of explanation and monotonous, and does not seem to\r\nadmit of as much embellishment as I thought, and, in short--which is the\r\nchief point--any excuse for being idle seems to me a good one: for I am\r\neven hesitating as to settling at Antium and spending the rest of my\r\nlife there, where, indeed, I would rather have been a duovir[199] than\r\nat Rome. You, indeed, have done more wisely in having made yourself a\r\nhome at Buthrotum. But, believe me, next to that free town of yours\r\ncomes the borough of the Antiates. Could you have believed that there\r\ncould be a town so near Rome, where there are many who have never seen\r\nVatinius? Where there is no one besides myself who cares whether one of\r\nthe twenty commissioners[200] is alive and well? Where no one intrudes\r\nupon me, and yet all are fond of me? This, this is the place to play the\r\nstatesman in! For yonder, not only am I not allowed to do so, but I am\r\nsick of it besides. Accordingly, I will compose a book of secret memoirs\r\nfor your ear alone in the style of Theopompus, or a more acrid one\r\nstill.[201] Nor have I now any politics except to hate the disloyal, and\r\neven that without any bitterness, but rather with a certain enjoyment in\r\nwriting. But to return to business: I have written to the city quæstors\r\nabout my brother's affair. See what they say to it, whether there is any\r\nhope of the cash in _denarii_, or whether we are to be palmed off with\r\nPompeian _cistophori_.[202] Farthermore, settle what is to be done about\r\nthe wall. Is there anything else? Yes! Let me know when you are thinking\r\nof starting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: A captive brought by Lucullus, who became a friend of\r\nCicero and tutor to his son and nephew.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: One of the two yearly officers of a colony--they answer\r\nto the consuls at Rome.

But you ask for two of\r\nmy speeches, one of which I did not care to write out because I had\r\nended it abruptly, the other because I did not want to praise the man I\r\ndid not like. But that, too, I will see about. At all events, something\r\nshall be forthcoming to prevent your thinking that I have been\r\nabsolutely idle. I am quite delighted to hear what you tell me about\r\nPublius; pray ferret out the whole story, and bring it to me when you\r\ncome, and meanwhile write anything you may make out or suspect, and\r\nespecially as to what he is going to do about the legation. For my part,\r\nbefore reading your letter, I was anxious that the fellow should go,\r\nnot, by heaven, in order to avoid his impeachment--for I am wonderfully\r\nkeen to try issues with him--but it seemed to me that, if he had secured\r\nany popularity by becoming a plebeian, he would thereby lose it. \"Well,\r\nwhy did you transfer yourself to the Plebs? Was it to make a call on\r\nTigranes? Tell me: do the kings of Armenia refuse to receive\r\npatricians?\" In a word, I had polished up my weapons to tear this\r\nembassy of his to pieces. But if he rejects it, and thus moves the anger\r\nof those proposers and augurs of the _lex curiata_,[203] it will be a\r\nfine sight! By Hercules, to speak the truth, our friend Publius is being\r\ntreated a little contemptuously! In the first place, though he was once\r\nthe only man at Cæsar's house, he is not now allowed to be one in\r\ntwenty:[204] in the next place, one legation had been promised him and\r\nanother has been given. The former fine fat one[205] for the levying of\r\nmoney is reserved, I presume, for Drusus of Pisaurum or for the gourmand\r\nVatinius: this latter miserable business, which might be very well done\r\nby a courier, is given to him, and his tribuneship deferred till it\r\nsuits them. Irritate the fellow, I beg you, as much as you can. The one\r\nhope of safety is their mutual disagreement, the beginning of which I\r\nhave got scent of from Curio. Moreover, Arrius is fuming at being\r\ncheated out of the consulship. Megabocchus and our blood-thirsty young\r\nmen are most violently hostile. May there be added to this, I pray, may\r\nthere be added, this quarrel about the augurate! I hope I shall often\r\nhave some fine letters to send you on these subjects. But I want to know\r\nthe meaning of your dark hint that some even of the _quinqueviri_[206]\r\nare speaking out. What can it be? If there is anything in it, there is\r\nmore hope than I had thought. And I would not have you believe that I\r\nask you these questions \"with any view to action,\"[207] because my heart\r\nis yearning to take part in practical politics. I was long ago getting\r\ntired of being at the helm, even when it was in my power. And now that I\r\nam forced to quit the ship, and have not cast aside the tiller, but have\r\nhad it wrenched out of my hands, my only wish is to watch their\r\nshipwreck from the shore: I desire, in the words of your favourite\r\nSophocles,\r\n\r\n              \"And safe beneath the roof\r\n    To hear with drowsy ear the plash of rain.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the wall, see to what is necessary. I will correct the mistake of\r\nCastricius, and yet Quintus had made it in his letter to me 15,000,\r\nwhile now to your sister he makes it 30,000.[208] Terentia sends you her\r\nregards: my boy Cicero commissions you to give Aristodemus the same\r\nanswer for him as you gave for his cousin, your sister's son.[209] I\r\nwill not neglect your reminder about your Amaltheia.[210] Take care of\r\nyour health.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: As he was a man _sui iuris_, Clodius's adoption into a\r\nnew gens (_adrogatio_) would have to take place before the _comitia\r\ncuriata_ (now represented by thirty lictors), which still retained this\r\nformal business. The ceremony required the presence of an augur and a\r\npontifex to hold it. Cicero supposes Pompey and Cæsar as intending to\r\nact in that capacity. Pompey, it seems, did eventually attend.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: One of the twenty commissioners under Cæsar's agrarian\r\nlaw. Cicero was offered and declined a place among them.

I\r\nsummon them: I ask if they have any letters. \"No,\" say they. \"What do\r\nyou say,\" said I, \"nothing from Pomponius?\" Frightened to death by my\r\nvoice and look, they confessed that they had received one, and that it\r\nhad been lost on the journey. Need I say more? I was intensely annoyed.\r\nFor no letter has come from you for the last few days without something\r\nin it important and entertaining. In these circumstances, if there was\r\nanything in the letter, dated 15th April, worth telling, pray write at\r\nonce, that I may not be left in ignorance; but if there was nothing but\r\nbanter, repeat even that for my benefit. And let me inform you that\r\nyoung Curio has been to call on me. What he said about Publius agreed\r\nexactly with your letter. He himself, moreover, wonderfully \"holds our\r\nproud kings in hate.\"[211] He told me that the young men generally were\r\nequally incensed, and could not put up with the present state of things.\r\nIf there is hope in them, we are in a good way. My opinion is that we\r\nshould leave things to take their course. I am devoting myself to my\r\nmemoir. However, though you may think me a Saufeius,[212] I am really\r\nthe laziest fellow in the world. But get into your head my several\r\njourneys, that you may settle where you intend to come and see me. I\r\nintend to arrive at my Formian house on the Parilia (21st April). Next,\r\nsince you think that at this time I ought to leave out luxurious\r\nCrater,[213] on the 1st of May I leave Formiæ, intending to reach Antium\r\non the 3rd of May. For there are games at Antium from the 4th to the 6th\r\nof May, and Tullia wants to see them. Thence I think of going to\r\nTusculum, thence to Arpinum, and be at Rome on the 1st of June. Be sure\r\nthat we see you at Formiæ or Antium, or at Tusculum. Rewrite your\r\nprevious letter for me, and add something new.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: A verse from Lucilius. \"Young Curio\" is the future\r\ntribune of B.C. 50, who was bribed by Cæsar, joined him at Ravenna at\r\nthe end of that year, was sent by him in B.C. 49 to Sicily and Africa,\r\nand fell in battle with the Pompeians and King Iuba.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: L.

I wish you to believe that there can\r\nbe nothing I should like more. If, however, the compact made about me is\r\nnot kept, I am in a seventh heaven to think that our friend the\r\nJerusalemitish plebeian-maker[216] will learn what a fine return he has\r\nmade to my brilliant speeches, of which you may expect a splendid\r\nrecantation. For, as well as I can guess, if that profligate is in\r\nfavour with our tyrants, he will be able to crow not only over the\r\n\"cynic consular,\"[217] but over your Tritons of the fish-ponds\r\nalso.[218] For I shall not possibly be an object of anybody's jealousy\r\nwhen robbed of power and of my influence in the senate. If, on the other\r\nhand, he should quarrel with them, it will not suit his purpose to\r\nattack me. However, let him attack. Charmingly, believe me, and with\r\nless noise than I had thought, has the wheel of the Republic revolved:\r\nmore rapidly, anyhow, than it should have done owing to Cato's error,\r\nbut still more owing to the unconstitutional conduct of those who have\r\nneglected the auspices, the Ælian law, the Iunian, the Licinian, the\r\nCæcilian and Didian,[219] who have squandered all the safeguards of the\r\nconstitution, who have handed over kingdoms as though they were private\r\nestates to tetrachs,[220] and immense sums of money to a small coterie.\r\nI see plainly now the direction popular jealousy is taking, and where it\r\nwill finally settle. Believe that I have learnt nothing from experience,\r\nnothing from Theophrastus,[221] if you don't shortly see the time of our\r\ngovernment an object of regret. For if the power of the senate was\r\ndisliked, what do you think will be the case when it has passed, not to\r\nthe people, but to three unscrupulous men? So let them then make whom\r\nthey choose consuls, tribunes, and even finally clothe Vatinius's wen\r\nwith the double-dyed purple[222] of the priesthood, you will see before\r\nlong that the great men will be not only those who have made no false\r\nstep,[223] but even he who did make a mistake, Cato. For, as to myself,\r\nif your comrade Publius will let me, I think of playing the sophist: if\r\nhe forces me, I shall at least defend myself, and, as is the trick of my\r\ntrade, I publicly promise to\r\n\r\n    \"Strike back at him who first is wroth with me.\"[224]\r\n\r\nMay the country only be on my side: it has had from me, if not more than\r\nits due, at least more than it ever demanded. I would rather have a bad\r\npassage with another pilot than be a successful pilot to such ungrateful\r\npassengers. But this will do better when we meet. For the present take\r\nan answer to your questions. I think of returning to Antium from Formiæ\r\non the 3rd of May. From Antium I intend to start for Tusculum on the 7th\r\nof May. But as soon as I have returned from Formiæ (I intend to be there\r\ntill the 29th of April) I will at once inform you. Terentia sends\r\ncompliments, and \"Cicero the little greets Titus the Athenian.\"[225]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: Q. Cæcilius Bassus, probably quæstor at Ostia.

She is \"Iuno\" perhaps as an enemy--as Bacon called the Duchess\r\nof Burgundy Henry VII.'s Iuno--or perhaps for a less decent reason, as\r\n_coniux sororque_ of Publius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: Pompey, who was proud of having taken Jerusalem.\r\n_Traductor ad plebem_, said of the magistrate presiding at the _comitia_\r\nfor adoption.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: Cicero himself.

Prof. Tyrrell, \"Tear 'em.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: The nobility, whom Cicero has before attacked as idle and\r\ncaring for nothing but their fish-ponds (_piscinarii_, cp. p. 59).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: The _lex Ælia_ (about B.C. 150) was a law regulating the\r\npowers of magistrates to dissolve _comitia_ on religious grounds, such\r\nas bad omens, _servata de cœlo, etc._ Cicero (who could have had very\r\nlittle belief in the augural science) regards them as safeguards of the\r\nstate, because as the Optimates generally secured the places in the\r\naugural college, it gave them a hold on elections and legislation.\r\nBibulus tried in vain to use these powers to thwart Cæsar this year. The\r\n_lex Cæcilia Didia_ (.B.C. 98) enforced the _trinundinatio_, or three\r\nweeks' notice of elections and laws, and forbade the proposal of a _lex\r\nsatura_, _i.e._, a law containing a number of miscellaneous enactments.\r\nPerhaps its violation refers to the _acta_ of Pompey in the East, which\r\nhe wanted to have confirmed _en bloc_. The senate had made difficulties:\r\nbut one of the fruits of the triumvirate was a measure for doing it. The\r\n_lex Iunia et Licinia_ (B.C. 62) confirmed the _Cæcilia Didia_, and\r\nsecured that the people knew what the proposed laws were.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: As Pompey did in Asia, _e.g._, to Deiotarus of Galatia,\r\nand about ten others.

This is\r\nindeed playing the king, and is utterly intolerable. Let Publius send\r\nsome men to witness and seal my affidavit: I will take an oath that my\r\nfriend Gnæus, the colleague of Balbus, told me at Antium that he had\r\nbeen present as augur to take the auspices. Two delightful letters from\r\nyou delivered at the same time! For which I do not know what I am to pay\r\nyou by way of reward for good news. That I owe you for them I candidly\r\nconfess. But observe the coincidence. I had just made my way from Antium\r\non to the _via Appia_ at Three Taverns,[226] on the very day of the\r\nCerealia (18th April), when my friend Curio meets me on his way from\r\nRome. At the same place and the same moment comes a slave from you with\r\nletters. The former asked me whether I hadn't heard the news? I said,\r\n\"No.\" \"Publius,\" says he, \"is a candidate for the tribuneship.\" \"You\r\ndon't mean it?\" \"Yes, I do,\" says he, \"and at daggers drawn with Cæsar.\r\nHis object is to rescind his acts.\" \"What says Cæsar?\" said I. \"He\r\ndenies having proposed any _lex_ for his adoption.\" Then he poured forth\r\nabout his own hatred, and that of Memmius and Metellus Nepos. I embraced\r\nthe youth and said good-bye to him, hastening to your letters. A fig for\r\nthose who talk about a \"living voice\"! What a much clearer view I got of\r\nwhat was going on from your letters than from his talk! About the\r\ncurrent rumours of the day, about the designs of Publius, about \"Iuno's\"\r\ntrumpet calls, about Athenio who leads his roughs, about his letter to\r\nGnæus, about the conversation of Theophanes and Memmius. Besides, how\r\neager you have made me to hear about the \"fast\" dinner party which you\r\nmention! I am greedy in curiosity, yet I do not feel at all hurt at your\r\nnot writing me a description of the symposium: I would rather hear it by\r\nword of mouth. As to your urging me to write something, my material\r\nindeed is growing, as you say, but the whole is still in a state of\r\nfermentation--\"new wine in the autumn.\" When the liquor has settled down\r\nand become clarified, I shall know better what to write. And even if you\r\ncannot get it from me at once, you shall be the first to have it: only\r\nfor some time you must keep it to yourself. You are quite right to like\r\nDicæarchus; he is an excellent writer, and a much better citizen than\r\nthese rulers of ours who reverse his name.[227] I write this letter at\r\nfour o'clock in the afternoon of the Cerealia (12th April), immediately\r\nafter reading yours, but I shall despatch it, I think, to-morrow, by\r\nanyone I may chance to meet on the road. Terentia is delighted with your\r\nletter, _et Cicéron le philosophe salue Titus l'homme d'état_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: Where the road from Antium joins the Appia.

I am determined not to be at the games at\r\nAntium: for it is somewhat of a solecism to wish to avoid all suspicion\r\nof frivolity, and yet suddenly to be shewn up as travelling for mere\r\namusement, and that of a foolish kind. Wherefore I shall wait for you\r\ntill the 7th of May at Formiæ. So now let me know what day we shall see\r\nyou. From Appii Forum, ten o'clock. I sent another a short time ago from\r\nThree Taverns.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: On the _via Appia_. Cicero halts at Appii Forum and at\r\nonce despatches a short note, probably by some one he finds there going\r\nto Rome, to announce a change of plan.

For at Antium there was never a day that I didn't know what was\r\ngoing on at Rome better than those who were there. For your letters\r\nused to shew me not only what was doing at Rome, but the actual\r\npolitical situation also--and not only that, but also what was likely to\r\nhappen. Now, unless I snatch a bit of news from some passing traveller,\r\nI can learn nothing at all. Wherefore, though I am expecting you in\r\nperson, yet pray give this boy, whom I have ordered to hurry back to me\r\nat once, a bulky letter, crammed not only with all occurrences, but with\r\nwhat you think about them; and be careful to let me know the day you are\r\ngoing to leave Rome. I intend staying at Formiæ till the 6th of May. If\r\nyou don't come there by that day, I shall perhaps see you at Rome. For\r\nwhy should I invite you to Arpinum?\r\n\r\n    \"A rugged soil, yet nurse of hardy sons:\r\n    No dearer land can e'er my eyes behold.\"[229]\r\n\r\nSo much for this. Take care of your health.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: Homer, _Odyss._ ix. 27.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX (A II, 13)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nFORMIÆ, APRIL\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 59, ÆT. 47]\r\n\r\nWhat an abominable thing! No one gave you my letter written on the spot\r\nat Three Taverns in answer to your delightful letters! But the fact is\r\nthat the packet into which I had put it arrived at my town house on the\r\nsame day as I wrote it, and has been brought back to me to Formiæ.\r\nAccordingly, I have directed the letter meant for you to be taken back\r\nagain, to shew you how pleased I was with yours. So you say that the\r\ntalk has died out at Rome! I thought so: but, by Hercules, it hasn't\r\ndied out in the country, and it has come to this, that the very country\r\ncan't stand the despotism you have got at Rome. When you come to\r\n\"Læstrygonia of the distant gates\"[230]--I mean Formiæ--what loud\r\nmurmurs! what angry souls! what unpopularity for our friend Magnus! His\r\nsurname is getting as much out of fashion as the \"Dives\" of Crassus.\r\nBelieve me, I have met no one here to take the present state of things\r\nas quietly as I do. Wherefore, credit me, let us stick to philosophy. I\r\nam ready to take my oath that there is nothing to beat it. If you have a\r\ndespatch to send to the Sicyonians,[231] make haste to Formiæ, whence I\r\nthink of going on the 6th of May.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: τηλέπυλον Λαιστρυγονίην, whose king Lamus (_Odyss._ x.\r\n81) was supposed to have founded Formiæ (Horace, _Od._ iii. 17).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: A despatch from senate or consuls.

However,\r\nthere is nothing which I think is now more to be dreaded by me than that\r\nour dear Sampsiceramus, finding himself belaboured by the tongues of\r\nall, and seeing these proceedings easy to upset, should begin striking\r\nout. For myself, I have so completely lost all nerve, that I prefer a\r\ndespotism, with the existing peace, to a state of war with the best\r\nhopes in the world. As to literary composition, to which you frequently\r\nurge me, it is impossible! My house is a basilica rather than a villa,\r\nowing to the crowds of visitors from Formiæ. But (you'll say) do I\r\nreally compare the Æmilian tribe to the crowd in a basilica?[232] Well,\r\nI say nothing about the common ruck--the rest of them don't bother me\r\nafter ten o'clock: but C. Arrius is my next door neighbour, or rather,\r\nhe almost lives in my house, and even declares that the reason for his\r\nnot going to Rome is that he may spend whole days with me here\r\nphilosophizing! And then, lo and behold, on my other side is Sebosus,\r\nthat friend of Catulus! Which way am I to turn? By heaven, I would start\r\nat once for Arpinum, only that I see that the most convenient place to\r\nawait your visit is Formiæ: but only up to the 6th of May! For you see\r\nwith what bores my ears are pestered. What a splendid opportunity, with\r\nsuch fellows in the house, if anyone wanted to buy my Formian\r\nproperty![233] And in spite of all this am I to make good my words, \"Let\r\nus attempt something great, and requiring much thought and leisure\"?\r\nHowever, I _will_ do something for you, and not spare my labour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: _At comparem_ for _at quam partem_. _At_ has its usual\r\nforce of introducing a supposed objection. I can't, say you, compare the\r\nÆmilian tribe, the Formiani, to a crowd in a court-house! They are not\r\nso bad as that, not so wasteful of time! I take _basilica_ to mean the\r\nsaunterers in a basilica, as we might say \"the park\" for the company in\r\nit, \"the exchange\" for the brokers in it. I feel certain that Prof.\r\nTyrrell is wrong in ascribing the words _sed--sunt_ to a quotation from\r\nAtticus's letter. What is wanted is to remove the full stop after\r\n_sunt_. The contrast Cicero is drawing is between the interruption to\r\nliterary work of a crowd of visitors and of one or two individuals\r\nalways turning up. The second is the worse--and here I think all workers\r\nwill agree with him: the crowd of visitors (_vulgus_) go at the regular\r\nhour, but individuals come in at all hours.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: Because he would be inclined to sell it cheap in his\r\ndisgust.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI (A II, 15)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nFORMIÆ, APRIL\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 59, ÆT. 47]\r\n\r\nAs you say, things are as shifting (I see) in public affairs as in your\r\nletter; still, that very variety of talk and opinion has a charm for me.\r\nFor I seem to be at Rome when I am reading your letter, and, as is the\r\nregular thing in questions of such importance, to hear something first\r\non one side and then on the other. But what I can't make out is\r\nthis--what he can possibly hit upon to settle the land question without\r\nencountering opposition. Again, as to Bibulus's firmness in putting off\r\nthe _comitia_, it only conveys the expression of his own views, without\r\nreally offering any remedy for the state of the Republic. Upon my word,\r\nmy only hope is in Publius! Let him become, let him become a tribune by\r\nall means, if for no other reason, yet that you may be brought back from\r\nEpirus! For I don't see how you can possibly afford to miss him,\r\nespecially if he shall elect to have a wrangle with me! But, seriously,\r\nif anything of the sort occurs, you would, I am certain, hurry back. But\r\neven supposing this not to be the case, yet whether he runs amuck or\r\nhelps to raise the state, I promise myself a fine spectacle, if only I\r\nmay enjoy it with you sitting by my side.[234] Just as I was writing\r\nthese words, enter Sebosus! I had scarcely got out a sigh when \"Good\r\nday,\" says Arrius. This is what you call going out of town! I shall\r\nreally be off to\r\n\r\n    \"My native mountains and my childhood's haunts.\"[235]\r\n\r\nIn fine, if I can't be alone I would rather be with downright\r\ncountryfolk than with such ultra-cockneys. However, I shall, since you\r\ndon't say anything for certain, wait for you up to the 5th of May.\r\nTerentia is much pleased with the attention and care you have bestowed\r\non her controversy with Mulvius. She is not aware that you are\r\nsupporting the common cause of all holders of public land. Yet, after\r\nall, _you_ do pay something to the _publicani_; she declines to pay even\r\nthat,[236] and, accordingly, she and Cicero--most conservative of\r\nboys--send their kind regards.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: The spectacle Cicero hopes for is Clodius's contests with\r\nthe triumvirs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: To Arpinum (see last letter). The verse is not known, and\r\nmay be a quotation from his own poem on Marius. He often quotes\r\nhimself.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: This is not mentioned elsewhere. The explanation seems to\r\nbe that for the _ager publicus_ allotted under the Sempronian laws a\r\nsmall rent had been exacted, which was abolished by a law of B.C. 111\r\n(the name of the law being uncertain). But some _ager publicus_ still\r\npaid rent, and the _publicanus_ Mulvius seems to have claimed it from\r\nsome land held by Terentia, perhaps on the ground that it was land (such\r\nas the _ager Campanus_) not affected by the law of Gracchus, and\r\ntherefore not by the subsequent law abolishing rent.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII (A II, 16)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nFORMIÆ, 29 APRIL\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 59, ÆT. 47]\r\n\r\nOn the day before the Kalends of May, when I had dined and was just\r\ngoing to sleep, the letter was delivered to me containing your news\r\nabout the Campanian land. You needn't ask: at first it gave me such a\r\nshock that there was no more sleep for me, though that was the result of\r\nthought rather than pain. On reflexion, however, the following ideas\r\noccurred to me. In the first place, from what you had said in your\r\nprevious letter--\"that you had heard from a friend of his[237] that a\r\nproposal was going to be made which would satisfy everybody\"--I had\r\nfeared some very sweeping measure, but I don't think this is anything of\r\nthe sort. In the next place, by way of consolation, I persuaded myself\r\nthat the hope of a distribution of land is now all centred on the\r\nCampanian territory.[238] That land cannot support more than 5,000, so\r\nas to give ten _iugera_ apiece:[239] the rest of the crowd of expectants\r\nmust necessarily be alienated from them. Besides, if there is anything\r\nthat more than another could inflame the feeling of the aristocrats, who\r\nare, I notice, already irritated, it is this; and all the more that with\r\nport-dues in Italy abolished,[240] and the Campanian land divided, what\r\nhome revenue is there except the five per cent. on manumissions? And\r\neven that, I think, it will only take a single trumpery harangue,\r\ncheered by our lackeys, to throw away also. What our friend Gnæus can\r\nbe thinking of I can't imagine--\r\n\r\n    \"For still he blows, and with no slender pipe,\r\n    But furious blasts by no mouth-band restrained\"--\r\n\r\nto be induced to countenance such a measure as that. For hitherto he has\r\nfenced with these questions: \"he approved Cæsar's laws, but Cæsar must\r\nbe responsible for his proceedings in carrying them\"; \"he himself was\r\nsatisfied with the agrarian law\"; \"whether it could be vetoed by a\r\ntribune or no was nothing to do with him\"; \"he thought the time had come\r\nfor the business of the Alexandrine king to be settled\"; \"it was no\r\nbusiness of his to inquire whether Bibulus had been watching the sky on\r\nthat occasion or no\"; \"as to the _publicani_, he had been willing to\r\noblige that order\"; \"what was going to happen if Bibulus came down to\r\nthe forum at that time he could not have guessed.\"[241] But now, my\r\nSampsiceramus, what will you say to this? That you have secured us a\r\nrevenue from the Antilibanus and removed that from the Campanian land?\r\nWell, how do you mean to vindicate that? \"I shall coerce you,\" says he,\r\n\"by means of Cæsar's army.\" You won't coerce me, by Hercules, by your\r\narmy so much as by the ingratitude of the so-called _boni_, who have\r\nnever made me any return, even in words, to say nothing of substantial\r\nrewards. But if I had put out my strength against that coterie, I should\r\ncertainly have found some way of holding my own against them. As things\r\nare, in view of the controversy between your friend Dicæarchus and my\r\nfriend Theophrastus--the former recommending the life of action, the\r\nlatter the life of contemplation--I think I have already obeyed both.\r\nFor as to Dicæarchus, I think I have satisfied his requirements; at\r\npresent my eyes are fixed on the school which not only allows of my\r\nabstaining from business, but blames me for not having always done so.\r\nWherefore let me throw myself, my dear Titus, into those noble studies,\r\nand let me at length return to what I ought never to have left.\r\n\r\nAs to what you say about Quintus's letter, when he wrote to me he was\r\nalso \"in front a lion and behind a ----.\"[242] I don't know what to say\r\nabout it; for in the first lines of his letter he makes such a\r\nlamentation over his continuance in his province, that no one could help\r\nbeing affected: presently he calms down sufficiently to ask me to\r\ncorrect and edit his Annals. However, I would wish you to have an eye to\r\nwhat you mention, I mean the duty on goods transferred from port to\r\nport. He says that by the advice of his council he has referred the\r\nquestion to the senate. He evidently had not read my letter, in which\r\nafter having considered and investigated the matter, I had sent him a\r\nwritten opinion that they were not payable.[243] If any Greeks have\r\nalready arrived at Rome from Asia on that business, please look into it\r\nand, if you think it right, explain to them my opinion on the subject.\r\nIf, to save the good cause in the senate, I can retract, I will gratify\r\nthe _publicani_: but if not, to be plain with you, I prefer in this\r\nmatter the interests of all Asia and the merchants; for it affects the\r\nlatter also very seriously. I think it is a matter of great importance\r\nto us. But you will settle it. Are the quæstors, pray, still hesitating\r\non the _cistophorus_ question?[244] If nothing better is to be had,\r\nafter trying everything in our power, I should be for not refusing even\r\nthe lowest offer. I shall see you at Arpinum and offer you country\r\nentertainment, since you have despised this at the seaside.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: Cæsar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: The old territory of Capua and the Stellatian Plain had\r\nbeen specially reserved from distribution under the laws of the Gracchi,\r\nand this reservation had not been repealed in subsequent laws: _ad\r\nsubsidia reipublicæ vectigalem relictum_ (Suet. _Cæs._ 20; cp. Cic. 2\r\n_Phil._ § 101).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: According to Suetonius 20,000 citizens had allotments on\r\nthe _ager publicus_ in Campania. But Dio says (xxxviii. 1) that the\r\nCampanian land was exempted by the _lex Iulia_ also. Its settlement was\r\nprobably later, by colonies of Cæsar's veterans.

Cicero leaves Atticus, as he\r\noften does, to fill up the rest of the line, δράκων, μέσση δὲ χίμαιρα\r\n(Hom. _Il._ vi. 181). He means, of course, that Quintus is\r\ninconsistent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: The question seems to be as to goods brought to a port\r\nand paying duty, and then, not finding a sale, being transferred to\r\nanother port in the same province. The _publicani_ at the second port\r\ndemanded the payment of a duty again, which Cicero decides against\r\nthem.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: Schutz takes this to mean, \"Are the quæstors now doubting\r\nas to paying _even cistophori_?\" _i.e._, are they, so far from paying in\r\nRoman _denarii_, even hesitating to pay in Asiatic? But if so, what is\r\nthe _extremum_ which Cicero advises Quintus to accept? Prof. Tyrrell,\r\nbesides, points out that the quæstors could hardly refuse to pay\r\nanything for provincial expenses. It is a question between _cistophori_\r\nand _denarii_. See p. 92.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII (A II, 17)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nFORMIÆ, MAY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 59, ÆT. 47]\r\n\r\nI quite agree with your letter. Sampsiceramus is getting up a\r\ndisturbance. We have everything to fear. He is preparing a despotism and\r\nno mistake about it. For what else is the meaning of that sudden\r\nmarriage union,[245] the Campanian land affair, the lavish expenditure\r\nof money? If these measures were final, even then the mischief had been\r\nvery great; but the nature of the case makes finality impossible. For\r\nhow could these measures possibly give them any pleasure in themselves?\r\nThey would never have gone so far as this unless they had been paving\r\nthe way for other fatal steps. Immortal Gods!--But, as you say, at\r\nArpinum about the 10th of May we will not weep over these questions,\r\nlest the hard work and midnight oil I have spent over my studies shall\r\nturn out to have been wasted, but discuss them together calmly. For I am\r\nnot so much consoled by a sanguine disposition as by philosophic\r\n\"indifference,\"[246] which I call to my aid in nothing so much as in our\r\ncivil and political business. Nay, more, whatever vanity or sneaking\r\nlove of reputation there is lurking in me--for it is well to know one's\r\nfaults--is tickled by a certain pleasurable feeling. For it used to\r\nsting me to the heart to think that centuries hence the services of\r\nSampsiceramus to the state would loom larger than my own. That anxiety,\r\nat least, is now put to rest. For he is so utterly fallen that, in\r\ncomparison with him, Curius might seem to be standing erect after his\r\nfall.[247] But all this when we meet. Yet, as far as I can see, you will\r\nbe at Rome when I come. I shall not be at all sorry for that, if you\r\ncan conveniently manage it. But if you come to see me, as you say in\r\nyour letter, I wish you would fish out of Theophanes how\r\n\"Arabarches\"[248] is disposed to me. You will, of course, inquire with\r\nyour usual zeal, and bring me the result to serve as a kind of\r\nsuggestion for the line of conduct I am to adopt. From his conversation\r\nwe shall be able to get an inkling of the whole situation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 245: The marriage of Pompey with Cæsar's daughter Iulia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: ἀδιαφορία, a word taken from the Stoies, _huic_\r\n[_Zenoni_] _summum bonum est in his rebus neutram in partem moveri, quæ\r\nἀδιαφορία ab ipso dicitur_ (_Acad._ ii. § 130).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: C.

We are bound hard\r\nand fast on every side, and are no longer making any difficulty as to\r\nbeing slaves, but fearing death and exile as though greater evils,\r\nthough they are in fact much smaller ones. Well, this is the\r\nposition--one unanimously groaned over, but not relieved by a word from\r\nanyone. The object, I surmise, of the men in power is to leave nothing\r\nfor anyone to lavish. The only man who opens his mouth and openly\r\ndisapproves is the young Curio. He is loudly cheered, and greeted in the\r\nforum in the most complimentary manner, and many other tokens of\r\ngoodwill are bestowed on him by the loyalists; while Fufius[249] is\r\npursued with shouts, jeers, and hisses. From such circumstances it is\r\nnot hope but indignation that is increased, for you see the citizens\r\nallowed to express their sentiments, but debarred from carrying them out\r\nwith any vigour. And to omit details, the upshot is that there is now no\r\nhope, I don't say of private persons, but even of the magistrates being\r\never free again. Nevertheless, in spite of this policy of repression,\r\nconversation, at least in society and at dinner tables, is freer than it\r\nwas. Indignation is beginning to get the better of fear, though that\r\ndoes not prevent a universal feeling of despair. For this Campanian\r\nlaw[250] contains a clause imposing an oath to be taken by candidates in\r\npublic meeting, that they will not suggest any tenure of public land\r\nother than that provided in the Julian laws. All the others take the\r\noath without hesitation: Laterensis[251] is considered to have shewn\r\nextraordinary virtue in retiring from his canvass for the tribuneship to\r\navoid the oath. But I don't care to write any more about politics. I am\r\ndissatisfied with myself, and cannot write without the greatest pain. I\r\nhold my own position with some dignity, considering the general\r\nrepression, but considering my achievements in the past, with less\r\ncourage than I should like. I am invited by Cæsar in a very gentlemanly\r\nmanner to accept a legation, to act as _legatus_ to himself, and even an\r\n\"open votive legation\" is offered me. But the latter does not give\r\nsufficient security, since it depends too much on the scrupulousness of\r\nPulchellus[252] and removes me just when my brother is returning;[253]\r\nthe former offers better security and does not prevent my returning when\r\nI please. I am retaining the latter, but do not think I shall use it.\r\nHowever, nobody knows about it. I don't like running away; I am itching\r\nto fight. There is great warmth of feeling for me. But I don't say\r\nanything positive: you will please not to mention it. I am, in fact,\r\nvery anxious about the manumission of Statius[254] and some other\r\nthings, but I have become hardened by this time. I could wish, or rather\r\nardently desire, that you were here: then I should not want advice or\r\nconsolation. But anyhow, be ready to fly hither directly I call for you.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: See Letter XIX, p. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: _I.e._, Cæsar's _agrarian law_, by which some of the\r\nCampanian _ager publicus_ was to be divided.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: M.

Sometimes it was simply a\r\n_legatio libera_, a sinecure without any pretence of purpose, sometimes\r\nit was _voti causa_, enabling a man to fulfil some vow he was supposed\r\nto have made. It was naturally open to much abuse, and Cicero as consul\r\nhad passed a law for limiting it in time. Clodius would become tribune\r\non 10 December, and this _libera legatio_ would protect Cicero as long\r\nas it lasted, but it would not, he thinks, last long enough to outstay\r\nthe tribuneship: if he went as _legatus_ to Cæsar in Gaul, he would be\r\nsafe, and might choose his own time for resigning and returning to\r\nRome.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: Statius, a slave of Quintus, was unpopular in the\r\nprovince. See p. 125.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV (A II, 19)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)\r\n\r\nROME (JULY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 59, ÆT. 47]\r\n\r\nI have many causes for anxiety, both from the disturbed state of\r\npolitics and from the personal dangers with which I am threatened. They\r\nare very numerous; but nothing gives me more annoyance than the\r\nmanumission of Statius: \"To think that he should have no reverence for\r\nmy authority! But of authority I say nothing--that he should have no\r\nfear of a quarrel with me, to put it mildly!\"[255] But what I am to do I\r\ndon't know, nor indeed is there so much in the affair as you would think\r\nfrom the talk about it. For myself, I am positively incapable of being\r\nangry with those I love deeply. I only feel vexed, and that to a\r\nsurprising degree. Other vexations are on really important matters. The\r\nthreats of Clodius and the conflicts before me touch me only slightly.\r\nFor I think I can either confront them with perfect dignity or decline\r\nthem without any embarrassment. You will say, perhaps, \"Enough of\r\ndignity, like the proverb, 'Enough of the oak':[256] an you love me,\r\ntake thought for safety!\" Ah, dear me, dear me, why are you not here?\r\nNothing, certainly, could have escaped you. I, perhaps, am somewhat\r\nblinded, and too much affected by my high ideal. I assure you there\r\nnever was anything so scandalous, so shameful, so offensive to all\r\nsorts, conditions and ages of men alike, as the present state of\r\naffairs. It is more so, by Hercules, than I could have wished, but not\r\nmore than I had expected. Your _populares_ have now taught even usually\r\nquiet men to hiss. Bibulus is praised to the skies: I don't know why,\r\nbut he has the same sort of applause as his\r\n\r\n    \"Who by delays restored alone our State.\"[257]\r\n\r\nPompey--the man I loved--has, to my infinite sorrow, ruined his own\r\nreputation. They hold no one by affection, and I fear they will be\r\nforced to use terror. I, however, refrain from hostility to their cause\r\nowing to my friendship for him, and yet I cannot approve, lest I should\r\nstultify my own past. The feeling of the people was shewn as clearly as\r\npossible in the theatre and at the shows. For at the gladiators both\r\nmaster and supporters were overwhelmed with hisses. At the games of\r\nApollo the actor Diphilus made a pert allusion to Pompey, in the words:\r\n\r\n    \"By our misfortunes thou art--Great.\"\r\n\r\nHe was encored countless times. When he delivered the line,\r\n\r\n    \"The time will come when thou wilt deeply mourn\r\n    That self-same valour,\"\r\n\r\nthe whole theatre broke out into applause, and so on with the rest. For\r\nthe verses do seem exactly as though they were written by some enemy of\r\nPompey's to hit the time. \"If neither laws nor customs can control,\"\r\netc., caused great sensation and loud shouts. Cæsar having entered as\r\nthe applause died away, he was followed by the younger Curio. The latter\r\nreceived an ovation such as used to be given to Pompey when the\r\nconstitution was still intact. Cæsar was much annoyed. A despatch is\r\nsaid to have been sent flying off to Pompey at Capua.[258] _They_ are\r\noffended with the equites, who rose to their feet and cheered Curio, and\r\nare at war with everybody. They are threatening the Roscian law,[259]\r\nand even the corn law.[260] There has been a great hubbub altogether.\r\nFor my part, I should have preferred their doings being silently\r\nignored; but that, I fear, won't be allowed. Men are indignant at what\r\nnevertheless must, it seems, be put up with. The whole people have\r\nindeed now one voice, but its strength depends rather on exasperation\r\nthan anything to back it up. Farthermore, our Publius is threatening me:\r\nhe is hostile, and a storm is hanging over my head which should bring\r\nyou post haste to town. I believe that I am still firmly supported by\r\nthe same phalanx of all loyal or even tolerably loyal men which\r\nsupported me when consul. Pompey displays no common affection for me. He\r\nalso asserts that Clodius is not going to say a word about me. In which\r\nhe is not deceiving me, but is himself deceived. Cosconius having died,\r\nI am invited to fill his place.[261] That would indeed be a case of\r\n\"invited to a dead man's place.\" I should have been beneath contempt in\r\nthe eyes of the world, and nothing could be conceived less likely to\r\nsecure that very \"personal safety\" of which you speak. For those\r\ncommissioners are disliked by the loyalists, and so I should have\r\nretained my own unpopularity with the disloyal, with the addition of\r\nthat attaching to others. Cæsar wishes me to accept a legateship under\r\nhim. This is a more honourable method of avoiding the danger. But I\r\ndon't wish to avoid it. What do I want, then? Why, I prefer fighting.\r\nHowever, I have not made up my mind. Again I say, Oh that you were here!\r\nHowever, if it is absolutely necessary I will summon you. What else is\r\nthere to say? What else? This, I think: I am certain that all is lost.\r\nFor why mince matters any longer? But I write this in haste, and, by\r\nHercules, in rather a nervous state. On some future occasion I will\r\neither write to you at full length, if I find a very trustworthy person\r\nto whom to give a letter, or if I write darkly you will understand all\r\nthe same. In these letters I will be Lælius, you Furius; the rest shall\r\nbe in riddles. Here I cultivate Cæcilius,[262] and pay him assiduous\r\nattention. I hear Bibulus's edicts have been sent to you. Our friend\r\nPompey is hot with indignation and wrath at them.[263]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 255: Terence, _Phorm._ 232.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: ἅλις δρυός, _i.e._, feeding on acorns is a thing of the\r\npast, it is out of date, like the golden age when they fed on wild fruit\r\n_et quæ deciderant patula Iovis arbore glandes_ (Ovid, _Met._ i. 106);\r\nand so is dignity, it is a question of _safety_ now.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: Ennius on Q.

There were many such. Perhaps the most recent was the _lex\r\nCassia Terentia_ (B.C. 73).

See p. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: After the scene of violence in which Bibulus, on\r\nattempting to prevent the agrarian law being passed, was driven from the\r\nrostra, with his lictors' fasces broken, he shut himself up in his house\r\nand published edicts declaring Cæsar's acts invalid, and denouncing the\r\nconduct of Pompey (Suet. _Cæs._ 20; Dio, xxxviii. 6).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI (A II, 20)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)\r\n\r\nROME (JULY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 59, ÆT. 47]\r\n\r\nI have done everything I could for Anicatus, as I understood was your\r\nwish. Numestius, in accordance with your earnestly expressed letter, I\r\nhave adopted as a friend. Cæcilius I look after diligently in all ways\r\npossible. Varro[264] does all I could expect for me. Pompey loves me and\r\nregards me as a dear friend. \"Do you believe that?\" you will say. I do:\r\nhe quite convinces me. But seeing that men of the world in all\r\nhistories, precepts, and even verses, are for ever bidding one be on\r\none's guard and forbidding belief, I carry out the former--\"to be on my\r\nguard\"--the latter--\"to disbelieve\"[265]--I cannot carry out. Clodius is\r\nstill threatening me with danger. Pompey asserts that there is no\r\ndanger. He swears it. He even adds that he will himself be murdered by\r\nhim sooner than I injured. The negotiation is going on. As soon as\r\nanything is settled I will write you word. If I have to fight, I will\r\nsummon you to share in the work. If I am let alone, I won't rout you out\r\nof your \"Amaltheia.\" About politics I will write briefly: for I am now\r\nafraid lest the very paper should betray me. Accordingly, in future, if\r\nI have anything more to write to you, I shall clothe it in covert\r\nlanguage. For the present the state is dying of a novel disorder; for\r\nalthough everybody disapproves of what has been done, complains, and is\r\nindignant about it, and though there is absolutely no difference of\r\nopinion on the subject, and people now speak openly and groan aloud, yet\r\nno remedy is applied: for we do not think resistance possible without a\r\ngeneral slaughter, nor see what the end of concession is to be except\r\nruin. Bibulus is exalted to the skies as far as admiration and affection\r\ngo. His edicts and speeches are copied out and read. He has reached the\r\nsummit of glory in a novel way. There is now nothing so popular as the\r\ndislike of the popular party. I have my fears as to how this will end.\r\nBut if I ever see my way clearly in anything, I will write to you more\r\nexplicitly. For yourself, if you love me as much as I am sure you do,\r\ntake care to be ready to come in all haste as soon as I call for you.\r\nBut I do my best, and shall do so, to make it unnecessary. I said I\r\nwould call you Furius in my letters, but it is not necessary to change\r\nyour name. I'll call myself Lælius and you Atticus, but I will use\r\nneither my own handwriting nor seal, if the letter happens to be such as\r\nI should not wish to fall into the hands of a stranger. Diodotus is\r\ndead; he has left me perhaps 1,000 sestertia. Bibulus has postponed the\r\nelections to the 18th of October, in an edict expressed in the vein of\r\nArchilochus.[266] I have received the books from Vibius: he is a\r\nmiserable poet,[267] but yet he is not without some knowledge nor wholly\r\nuseless. I am going to copy the book out and send it back.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 264: M. Terentius Varro, \"the most learned of the Romans,\" and\r\nauthor of very large numbers of books.

See Letter\r\nXLVIII, p. 120.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII (A II, 21)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)\r\n\r\nROME (JULY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 59, ÆT. 47]\r\n\r\nWhy should I write to you on the Republic in detail? It is utterly\r\nruined; and is, so far, in a worse state than when you left it, that\r\nthen a despotism seemed to be oppressing it which was popular with the\r\nmultitude, and though offensive to the loyalists, yet short of actual\r\nmischief; but now all on a sudden they have become so universally hated,\r\nthat I tremble to think what will be the end of it. For we have had\r\nexperience of those men's resentment and violence, who have ruined\r\neverything in their anger against Cato; yet they were employing such\r\nslow poisons, that it seemed as though our end might be painless. Now,\r\nhowever, I fear they have been exasperated by the hisses of the crowd,\r\nthe talk of the respectable classes, and the murmurs of Italy. For my\r\npart, I was in hopes, as I often used actually to say to you, that the\r\nwheel of the state chariot had made its revolution with scarcely any\r\nnoise and leaving scarcely any visible rut; and it would have been so,\r\nif people could only have waited till the storm had blown over. But\r\nafter sighing in secret for a long time they all began, first to groan,\r\nand at last to talk and shout. Accordingly, that friend of ours,\r\nunaccustomed to being unpopular, always used to an atmosphere of praise,\r\nand revelling in glory, now disfigured in body and broken in spirit,\r\ndoes not know which way to turn; sees that to go on is dangerous, to\r\nreturn a betrayal of vacillation; has the loyalists his enemies, the\r\ndisloyal themselves not his friends. Yet see how soft-hearted I am. I\r\ncould not refrain from tears when, on the 25th of July, I saw him making\r\na speech on the edicts of Bibulus. The man who in old times had been\r\nused to bear himself in that place with the utmost confidence and\r\ndignity, surrounded by the warmest affection of the people, amidst\r\nuniversal favour--how humble, how cast down he was then! How ill-content\r\nwith himself, to say nothing of how unpleasing to his audience! Oh,\r\nwhat a spectacle! No one could have liked it but Crassus--no one else in\r\nthe world! Not I, for considering his headlong descent from the stars,\r\nhe seemed to me to have lost his footing rather than to have been\r\ndeliberately following a path; and, as Apelles, if he had seen his\r\nVenus, or Protogenes his Ialysus daubed with mud, would, I presume, have\r\nfelt great sorrow, so neither could I behold without great sorrow a man,\r\nportrayed and embellished with all the colours of my art, suddenly\r\ndisfigured. Although no one thought, in view of the Clodius business,\r\nthat I was bound to be his friend, yet so great was my affection for\r\nhim, that no amount of injury was capable of making it run dry. The\r\nresult is that those Archilochian edicts of Bibulus against him are so\r\npopular, that one can't get past the place where they are put up for the\r\ncrowd of readers, and so deeply annoying to himself that he is pining\r\nwith vexation. To me, by Hercules, they are distressing, both because\r\nthey give excessive pain to a man whom I have always loved, and because\r\nI fear lest one so impulsive and so quick to strike, and so unaccustomed\r\nto personal abuse, may, in his passionate resentment, obey the dictates\r\nof indignation and anger. I don't know what is to be the end of Bibulus.\r\nAs things stand at present he is enjoying a wonderful reputation. For on\r\nhis having postponed the _comitia_ to October, as that is a measure\r\nwhich is always against the popular feeling, Cæsar had imagined that the\r\nassembly could be induced by a speech of his to go to Bibulus's house;\r\nbut after a long harangue full of seditious suggestions, he failed to\r\nextract a word from anyone. In short, they feel that they do not possess\r\nthe cordial goodwill of any section: all the more must we fear some act\r\nof violence. Clodius is hostile to us. Pompey persists in asserting that\r\nhe will do nothing against me. It is risky for me to believe that, and I\r\nam preparing myself to meet his attack. I hope to have the warmest\r\nfeelings of all orders on my side. I have personally a longing for you,\r\nand circumstances also demand your presence at that time. I shall feel\r\nit a very great addition to my policy, to my courage, and, in a word, to\r\nmy safety, if I see you in time. Varro does all I can expect. Pompey\r\ntalks like an angel. I have hopes that I shall come off with flying\r\ncolours, or at any rate without being molested. Be sure and tell me how\r\nyou are, how you are amusing yourself, and what settlement you have come\r\nto with the Sicyonians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII (A II, 22)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)\r\n\r\nROME (JULY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 59, ÆT. 47]\r\n\r\nHow I wished you had stayed at Rome! I am sure you would have stayed if\r\nyou had foreseen what was going to happen. For then we should have had\r\nno difficulty in keeping \"Pulchellus\" in order, or at least should have\r\nknown what he was going to do. As things are, he darts about, talks like\r\na madman, never sticks to anything: threatens now this one and now that:\r\nseems likely, in reality, to do whatever turns up. When he sees how\r\nunpopular the present state of things is, he seems to intend an attack\r\nupon the authors of it; but when he again recalls their power and\r\narmies, he transfers his hostility to the loyalists. Me personally he\r\nthreatens at one time with violence, at another with impeachment. With\r\nhim Pompey has remonstrated, and, as he tells me himself--for I have no\r\nother evidence--has urgently remonstrated, pointing out that he would\r\nhimself lie under the extreme imputation of perfidy and unprincipled\r\nconduct, if any danger to me were created by the man whom he had himself\r\narmed by acquiescing in his becoming a plebeian: that both he and\r\nAppius[268] had pledged themselves in regard to me: if Clodius did not\r\nrespect that, he should shew such annoyance that everyone would\r\nunderstand that he valued my friendship above everything. Having said\r\nthis and much else to the same effect, he told me that the fellow at\r\nfirst argued against it at great length and for a long time, but\r\neventually gave way and declared that he would do nothing against his\r\nwishes. Nevertheless, he has not ceased since then speaking of me with\r\nthe greatest bitterness. But even if he had not done so, I should have\r\nfelt no confidence in him, but should have been making every\r\npreparation, as in fact I am doing. As it is, I am so conducting myself\r\nthat every day the affections of people towards me and the strength of\r\nmy position are enhanced. I don't touch politics in any shape or way; I\r\nemploy myself with the greatest assiduity in pleading causes and in my\r\nregular forensic business.[269] And this I feel is extremely gratifying,\r\nnot only to those who enjoy my services, but also to the people\r\ngenerally. My house is crowded; I am met by processions; the memory of\r\nmy consulship is renewed; men's feelings are clearly shewn: my hopes are\r\nso raised, that the struggle hanging over me seems at times one from\r\nwhich I need not shrink. Now is the time that I need your advice, your\r\nlove and fidelity. Wherefore come post haste! Everything will be easy\r\nfor me if I have you. I can carry on many negotiations through our\r\nfriend Varro, which will be on firmer ground with you to back them up; a\r\ngreat deal can be elicited from Publius himself, and be brought to my\r\nknowledge, which cannot possibly be kept concealed from you; a great\r\ndeal also--but it is absurd to enumerate particulars, when I want you\r\nfor everything. I would like you to be convinced of this above all, that\r\neverything will be simplified for me if I see you: but it all turns on\r\nthis coming to pass _before_ he enters on his office. I think that if\r\nyou are here while Crassus is egging on Pompey--as you can get out of\r\nClodius himself, by the agency of \"Iuno,\"[270] how far they are acting\r\nin good faith--we shall escape molestation, or at any rate not be left\r\nunder a delusion. You don't stand in need of entreaties or urgency from\r\nme. You understand what my wish is, and what the hour and the importance\r\nof the business demand. As to politics, I can tell you nothing except\r\nthat everybody entertains the greatest detestation for those who are\r\nmasters of everything. There is, however, no hope of a change. But, as\r\nyou easily understand, Pompey himself is discontented and extremely\r\ndissatisfied with himself. I don't see clearly what issue to expect: but\r\ncertainly such a state of affairs seems likely to lead to an outbreak of\r\nsome sort. Alexander's books[271]--a careless writer and a poor poet,\r\nand yet not without some useful information--I have sent back to you. I\r\nhave had pleasure in admitting Numerius Numestius to my friendship, and\r\nI find him a man of character and good sense, worthy of your\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: Appius Claudius Pulcher, elder brother of P.

You will be able to gather from that how I am distracted\r\nwith business. For as I had not a moment to spare and was obliged to\r\ntake a walk in order to refresh my poor voice, I have dictated this\r\nwhile walking. The first thing, then, which I wish you to know is that\r\nour friend \"Sampsiceramus\" is exceedingly dissatisfied with his\r\nposition, and desires to be restored to the place from which he has\r\nfallen; that he confides his annoyance to me, and is without disguise\r\nseeking for a remedy--which I don't think can be found. The second thing\r\nis that all on that side, whether promoters or mere hangers-on, are\r\nfalling out of fashion, though no one opposes them: there never was a\r\ngreater unanimity of feeling or talk everywhere. For myself (for I am\r\nsure you wish to know it) I take part in no political deliberations, and\r\nhave devoted myself entirely to my forensic business and work. Thereby,\r\nas may easily be understood, I have frequent occasion to refer to my\r\npast achievements and to express my regret. But the brother of our\r\n\"Iuno\" is giving utterance to all kinds of alarming threats, and, while\r\ndisclaiming them to \"Sampsiceramus,\" makes an open avowal and parade of\r\nthem to others. Wherefore, loving me as much as I know you do, if you\r\nare asleep, wake up; if you are standing, start walking; if you are\r\nwalking, set off running; if you are running, take wings and fly. You\r\ncan scarcely believe how much I confide in your advice and wisdom, and\r\nabove all in your affection and fidelity. The importance of the\r\ninterests involved perhaps demands a long disquisition, but the close\r\nunion of our hearts is contented with brevity. It is of very great\r\nimportance to me that, if you can't be at Rome at the elections, you\r\nshould at least be here after his election is declared.[272] Take care\r\nof your health.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: _I.e._, between the time of his election and of his\r\nentering on his office. The tribunes entered on their office on the 10th\r\nof December; the elections usually took place in July, but were\r\npostponed till October this year by Bibulus. See Letter XLVI, p. 115.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL (A II, 24)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)\r\n\r\nROME (JULY OR AUGUST)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 59, ÆT. 47]\r\n\r\nIn the letter which I delivered to Numestius I begged you to come back,\r\nin the most urgent and vehement terms it was possible to use. To the\r\nspeed which I then enjoined even add something if you possibly can. And\r\nyet do not be agitated, for I know you well, and am not ignorant of \"how\r\nlove is all compact of thought and fear.\" But the matter, I hope, is\r\ngoing to be less formidable in the end than it was at its beginning.\r\nThat fellow Vettius, our old informer, promised Cæsar, as far as I can\r\nmake out, that he would secure young Curio being brought under some\r\nsuspicion of guilt. Accordingly, he wormed his way into intimacy with\r\nthe young man, and having, as is proved, often met him, at last went the\r\nlength of telling him that he had resolved by the help of his slaves to\r\nmake an attack upon Pompey and assassinate him. Curio reported this to\r\nhis father, the latter to Pompey. The matter was reported to the senate.\r\nVettius, on being brought in, at first denied that he had ever had any\r\nappointment with Curio. However, he did not long stick to that, but\r\nimmediately claimed the protection of the state as giving information.\r\nThere was a shout of \"no\" to this;[273] but he went on to state that\r\nthere had been a confederacy of young men under the leadership of Curio,\r\nto which Paullus had at first belonged, and Q. Cæpio (I mean\r\nBrutus[274]) and Lentulus, son of the flamen, with the privity of his\r\nfather: that afterwards C. Septimius, secretary to Bibulus, had brought\r\nhim a dagger from Bibulus. That made the whole thing ridiculous, as\r\nthough Vettius would have been at a loss for a dagger unless the consul\r\nhad given him one; and it was all the more scouted because on the 5th of\r\nMay Bibulus had told Pompey to be on his guard against plots; on which\r\noccasion Pompey had thanked him. Young Curio, being brought into the\r\nsenate, spoke in answer to the allegations of Vettius; and on this\r\nparticular occasion the strongest thing against Vettius was his having\r\nsaid that the plan of the young men was to attack Pompey in the forum,\r\nwith the help of Gabinius's gladiators,[275] and that in this the\r\nring-leader was Paullus, who was ascertained to have been in Macedonia\r\nat that time. A decree of the senate is passed that \"Vettius, having\r\nconfessed to having 'worn a dagger,'[276] should be cast into prison;\r\nthat anyone releasing him would be guilty of treason to the state.\" The\r\nopinion generally held is that the whole affair had been arranged.\r\nVettius was to be caught in the forum with a dagger, and his slaves also\r\nwith weapons, and he was then to offer to lay an information; and this\r\nwould have been carried out, had not the Curios given Pompey previous\r\ninformation. Presently the decree of the senate was read in public\r\nassembly. Next day, however, Cæsar--the man who formerly as prætor had\r\nbidden Q. Catulus[277] speak on the ground below--now brought Vettius on\r\nto the rostra, and placed him on an elevation to which Bibulus, though\r\nconsul, was prevented from aspiring. Here that fellow said exactly what\r\nhe chose about public affairs, and, having come there primed and\r\ninstructed, first struck Cæpio's name out of his speech, though he had\r\nnamed him most emphatically in the senate, so that it was easy to see\r\nthat a night and a nocturnal intercession[278] had intervened: next he\r\nnamed certain men on whom he had not cast even the slightest suspicion\r\nin the senate: L. Lucullus, by whom he said that C. Fannius was usually\r\nsent to him--the man who on a former occasion had backed a prosecution\r\nof Clodius; L. Domitius, whose house had been agreed on as the\r\nheadquarters of the conspirators. Me he did not _name_, but he said that\r\n\"an eloquent consular, who lived near the consul, had said to him that\r\nthere was need of some Servilius Ahala or Brutus being found.\"[279] He\r\nadded at the very end, on being recalled by Vatinius after the assembly\r\nhad been dismissed, that he had been told by Curio that my son-in-law\r\nPiso was privy to these proceedings, as M. Laterensis also. At present\r\nVettius is on trial for \"violence\" before Crassus Dives,[280] and when\r\ncondemned he intends to claim the impunity of an informer; and if he\r\nobtains that, there seem likely to be some prosecutions. I don't despise\r\nthe danger, for I never despise any danger, but neither do I much fear\r\nit. People indeed shew very great affection for me, but I am quite tired\r\nof life: such a scene of misery is it all. It was only the other day\r\nthat we were fearing a massacre, which the speech of that gallant old\r\nman Q. Considius prevented:[281] now this one, which we might have\r\nfeared any day, has suddenly turned up. In short, nothing can be more\r\nunfortunate than I, or more fortunate than Catulus, both in the\r\nsplendour of his life and in the time of his death. However, in the\r\nmidst of these miseries I keep my spirit erect and undismayed, and\r\nmaintain my position in a most dignified manner and with great caution.\r\nPompey bids me have no anxiety about Clodius, and shews the most cordial\r\ngoodwill to me in everything he says. I desire to have you to suggest my\r\npolicy, to be the partner in my anxieties, and to share my every\r\nthought. Therefore I have commissioned Numestius to urge you, and I now\r\nentreat you with the same or, if possible, greater earnestness, to\r\nliterally fly to us. I shall breathe again when I once see you.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: _Reclamatum est._ The MSS. have _haud reclamatum est_,\r\n\"it was not refused.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: Marcus Iunius Brutus, the future assassin of Cæsar,\r\nadopted by his uncle, Q.

For instance, you know I lately wrote to\r\nyou about Varro's kindness to me, and that you wrote me back word that\r\nthe circumstance gave you the greatest delight. But I should have\r\npreferred your writing to him and saying that he was doing all I could\r\nexpect--not because he was, but in order that he might do so. For he is\r\na man of astonishing whims, as you know, \"tortuous and no\r\nwise----.\"[282] But I stick to the rule \"Follies of those in power,\"\r\netc.[283] But, by Hercules, that other friend of yours, Hortalus--with\r\nwhat a liberal hand, with what candour, and in what ornate language has\r\nhe praised me to the skies, when speaking of the prætorship of Flaccus\r\nand that incident of the Allobroges.[284] I assure you nothing could\r\nhave been more affectionate, complimentary, or more lavishly expressed.\r\nI very much wish that you would write and tell him that I sent you word\r\nof it. Yet why write? I think you are on your way and are all but here.\r\nFor I have urged you so strongly to come in my previous letters. I am\r\nexpecting you with great impatience, longing for you very much; nor do I\r\ncall for you more than circumstances themselves and the state of the\r\ntimes. Nothing can be more desperate than the position of politics,\r\nnothing more unpopular than the authors of it, I--as I think, hope, and\r\nimagine--am safe behind a rampart of goodwill of the strongest kind.\r\nWherefore fly to me: you will either relieve me from all annoyance or\r\nwill share it. My letter is all the shorter because, as I hope, I shall\r\nbe able in a very short time to talk over what I want to say face to\r\nface.

His arrival gave me\r\nuneasiness, because you said in your letter that you would be plundered\r\nby your household in his absence. However, I thought it a very happy\r\ncircumstance that he anticipated the expectation of his arrival, and the\r\ncompany that would have assembled to meet him, if he had left the\r\nprovince with you, and had not appeared before. For people have\r\nexhausted their remarks, and many observations have been made and done\r\nwith of the \"Nay, but I looked for a mighty man\"[285] kind, which I am\r\nglad to have all over before you come. But as for the motive for your\r\nsending him--that he might clear himself with me--that was not at all\r\nnecessary. For, to begin with, I had never suspected him, nor in what I\r\nwrote to you about him was I expressing my own judgment; but since the\r\ninterest and safety of all of us who take part in public business\r\ndepends, not on truth alone, but on report also, I wrote you word of\r\nwhat people were saying, not what I thought myself. How prevalent and\r\nhow formidable that talk was Statius ascertained himself on his arrival.\r\nFor he was present when certain persons at my house gave vent to some\r\ncomplaints on that very subject, and had the opportunity of perceiving\r\nthat the observations of the malevolent were being directed at himself\r\nespecially. But it used to annoy me most when I was told that he had\r\ngreater influence with you, than your sober time of life and the wisdom\r\nof a governor required. How many people, do you suppose, have solicited\r\nme to give them a letter of introduction to Statius? How often, do you\r\nsuppose, has he himself, while talking without reserve to me, made such\r\nobservations as, \"I never approved of that,\" \"I told him so,\" \"I tried\r\nto persuade him,\" \"I warned him not to\"? And even if these things shew\r\nthe highest fidelity, as I believe they do, since that is your judgment,\r\nyet the mere appearance of a freedman or slave enjoying such influence\r\ncannot but lower your dignity: and the long and short of it is--for I am\r\nin duty bound not to say anything without good grounds, nor to keep back\r\nanything from motives of policy--that Statius has supplied all the\r\nmaterial for the gossip of those who wished to decry you; that formerly\r\nall that could be made out was that certain persons were angry at your\r\nstrictness; but that after his manumission the angry had something to\r\ntalk about.\r\n\r\nNow I will answer the letters delivered to me by L. Cæsius, whom, as I\r\nsee you wish it, I will serve in every way I can. One of them is about\r\nZeuxis of Blaundus, whom you say was warmly recommended to you by me\r\nthough a most notorious matricide. In this matter, and on this subject\r\ngenerally, please listen to a short statement, lest you should by chance\r\nbe surprised at my having become so conciliatory towards Greeks. Seeing,\r\nas I did, that the complaints of Greeks, because they have a genius for\r\ndeceit, were allowed an excessive weight, whenever I was told of any of\r\nthem making complaint of you, I appeased them by every means in my\r\npower. First, I pacified the Dionysopolitans, who were very bitter:\r\nwhose chief man, Hermippus, I secured not only by my conversation, but\r\nby treating him as a friend. I did the same to Hephæstus of Apameia; the\r\nsame to that most untrustworthy fellow, Megaristus of Antandrus; the\r\nsame to Nicias of Smyrna; I also embraced with all the courtesy I\r\npossessed the most trumpery of men, even Nymphôn of Colophôn. And all\r\nthis I did from no liking for these particular people, or the nation as\r\na whole: I was heartily sick of their fickleness and obsequiousness, of\r\nfeelings that are not affected by our kindness, but by our position.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Zeuxis. When he was telling me the same story as you\r\nmention in your letter about what M. Cascellius had said to him in\r\nconversation, I stopped him from farther talk, and admitted him to my\r\nsociety. I cannot, however, understand your virulence when you say that,\r\nhaving sewn up in the parricide's-sack two Mysians at Smyrna, you\r\ndesired to display a similar example of your severity in the upper part\r\nof your province, and that, therefore, you had wished to inveigle Zeuxis\r\ninto your hands by every possible means. For if he had been brought into\r\ncourt, he ought perhaps not to have been allowed to escape: but there\r\nwas no necessity for his being hunted out and inveigled by soft words to\r\nstand a trial, as you say in your letter--especially as he is one whom I\r\nlearn daily, both from his fellow citizens and from many others, to be a\r\nman of higher character than you would expect from such an obscure town\r\nas his.[286] But, you will say, it is only Greeks to whom I am\r\nindulgent. What! did not I do everything to appease L. Cæcilius? What a\r\nman! how irritable! how violent! In fact, who is there except\r\nTuscenius,[287] whose case admitted of no cure, have I not softened? See\r\nagain, I have now on my hands a shifty, mean fellow, though of\r\nequestrian rank, called Catienus: even he is going to be smoothed down.\r\nI don't blame you for having been somewhat harsh to his father, for I am\r\nquite sure you have acted with good reason: but what need was there of a\r\nletter of the sort which you sent to the man himself? \"That the man was\r\nrearing the cross for himself from which you had already pulled him off\r\nonce; that you would take care to have him smoked to death, and would be\r\napplauded by the whole province for it.\" Again, to a man named C.\r\nFabius--for that letter also T. Catienus is handing round--\"that you\r\nwere told that the kidnapper Licinius, with his young kite of a son, was\r\ncollecting taxes.\" And then you go on to ask Fabius to burn both father\r\nand son alive if he can; if not, to send them to you, that they may be\r\nburnt to death by legal sentence. That letter sent by you in jest to C.\r\nFabius, if it really is from you, exhibits to ordinary readers a\r\nviolence of language very injurious to you. Now, if you will refer to\r\nthe exhortations in all my letters, you will perceive that I have never\r\nfound fault with you for anything except harshness and sharpness of\r\ntemper, and occasionally, though rarely, for want of caution in the\r\nletters you write. In which particulars, indeed, if my influence had had\r\ngreater weight with you than a somewhat excessive quickness of\r\ndisposition, or a certain enjoyment in indulging temper, or a faculty\r\nfor epigram and a sense of humour, we should certainly have had no cause\r\nfor dissatisfaction. And don't you suppose that I feel no common\r\nvexation when I am told how Vergilius is esteemed, and your neighbour\r\nC. Octavius?[288] For if you only excel your neighbours farther up\r\ncountry, in Cilicia and Syria, that is a pretty thing to boast of! And\r\nthat is just the sting of the matter, that though the men I have named\r\nare not more blameless than yourself, they yet outdo you in the art of\r\nwinning favour, though they know nothing of Xenophon's Cyrus or\r\nAgesilaus; from which kings, in the exercise of their great office, no\r\none ever heard an irritable word. But in giving you this advice, as I\r\nhave from the first, I am well aware how much good I have done.[289]\r\n\r\nNow, however, as you are about to quit your province, pray do leave\r\nbehind you--as I think you are now doing--as pleasant a memory as\r\npossible. You have a successor of very mild manners; in other respects,\r\non his arrival, you will be much missed. In sending letters of\r\nrequisition, as I have often told you, you have allowed yourself to be\r\ntoo easily persuaded. Destroy, if you can, all such as are inequitable,\r\nor contrary to usage, or contradictory to others. Statius told me that\r\nthey were usually put before you ready written, read by himself, and\r\nthat, if they were inequitable, he informed you of the fact: but that\r\nbefore he entered your service there had been no sifting of letters;\r\nthat the result was that there were volumes containing a selection of\r\nletters, which were usually adversely criticised.[290] On this subject I\r\nam not going to give you any advice at this time of day, for it is too\r\nlate; and you cannot but be aware that I have often warned you in\r\nvarious ways and with precision. But I have, on a hint from Theopompus,\r\nintrusted him with this message to you: do see by means of persons\r\nattached to you, which you will find no difficulty in doing, that the\r\nfollowing classes of letters are destroyed--first, those that are\r\ninequitable; next, those that are contradictory; then those expressed in\r\nan eccentric or unusual manner; and lastly, those that contain\r\nreflexions on anyone. I don't believe all I hear about these matters,\r\nand if, in the multiplicity of your engagements, you have let certain\r\nthings escape you, now is the time to look into them and weed them out.\r\nI have read a letter said to have been written by your nomenclator Sulla\r\nhimself, which I cannot approve: I have read some written in an angry\r\nspirit. But the subject of letters comes in pat: for while this sheet of\r\npaper was actually in my hands, L. Flavius, prætor-designate and a very\r\nintimate friend, came to see me. He told me that you had sent a letter\r\nto his agents, which seemed to me most inequitable, prohibiting them\r\nfrom taking anything from the estate of the late L. Octavius Naso, whose\r\nheir L. Flavius is, until they had paid a sum of money to C. Fundanius;\r\nand that you had sent a similar letter to the Apollonidenses, not to\r\nallow any payment on account of the estate of the late Octavius till the\r\ndebt to Fundanius had been discharged. It seems to me hardly likely that\r\nyou have done this; for it is quite unlike your usual good sense. The\r\nheir not to take anything? What if he disowns the debt? What if he\r\ndoesn't owe it at all? Moreover, is the prætor wont to decide whether a\r\ndebt is due?[291] Don't I, again, wish well to Fundanius? Am I not his\r\nfriend? Am I not touched with compassion? No one more so: but in certain\r\nmatters the course of law is so clear as to leave no place for personal\r\nfeeling. And Flavius told me that expressions were used in the letter,\r\nwhich he said was yours, to the effect that you would \"either thank them\r\nas friends, or make yourself disagreeable to them as enemies.\" In short,\r\nhe was much annoyed, complained of it to me in strong terms, and begged\r\nme to write to you as seriously as I could. This I am doing, and I do\r\nstrongly urge you again and again to withdraw your injunction to\r\nFlavius's agents about taking money from the estate, and not to lay any\r\nfarther injunction on the Apollonidenses contrary to the rights of\r\nFlavius. Pray do everything you can for the sake of Flavius and, indeed,\r\nof Pompey also. I would not, upon my honour, have you think me liberal\r\nto him at the expense of any inequitable decision on your part: but I do\r\nentreat you to leave behind you some authority, and some memorandum of a\r\ndecree or of a letter under your hand, so framed as to support the\r\ninterests and cause of Flavius. For the man, who is at once very\r\nattentive to me, and tenacious of his own rights and dignity, is feeling\r\nextremely hurt that he has not prevailed with you either on the grounds\r\nof personal friendship or of legal right; and, to the best of my belief,\r\nboth Pompey and Cæsar have, at one time or another, commended the\r\ninterests of Flavius to you, and Flavius has written to you personally,\r\nand certainly I have. Wherefore, if there is anything which you think\r\nyou ought to do at my request, let it be this. If you love me, take\r\nevery care, take every trouble, and insure Flavius's cordial thanks both\r\nto yourself and myself. I cannot use greater earnestness in making any\r\nrequest than I use in this.\r\n\r\nAs to what you say about Hermias, it has been in truth a cause of much\r\nvexation to me. I wrote you a letter in a rather unbrotherly spirit,\r\nwhich I dashed off in a fit of anger and now wish to recall, having been\r\nirritated by what Lucullus's freedman told me, immediately after hearing\r\nof the bargain. For this letter, which was not expressed in a brotherly\r\nway, you ought to have brotherly feeling enough to make allowance. As to\r\nCensorinus, Antonius, the Cassii, Scævola--I am delighted to hear from\r\nyou that you possess their friendship. The other contents of that same\r\nletter of yours were expressed more strongly than I could have wished,\r\nsuch as your \"with my ship at least well trimmed\"[292] and your \"die\r\nonce for all.\"[293] You will find those expressions to be unnecessarily\r\nstrong. My scoldings have always been very full of affection. They\r\nmention certain things for complaint,[294] but these are not important,\r\nor rather, are quite insignificant. For my part, I should never have\r\nthought you deserving of the least blame in any respect, considering the\r\nextreme purity of your conduct, had it not been that our enemies are\r\nnumerous. Whatever I have written to you in a tone of remonstrance or\r\nreproach I have written from a vigilant caution, which I maintain, and\r\nshall maintain; and I shall not cease imploring you to do the same.\r\nAttalus of Hypæpa has begged me to intercede with you that you should\r\nnot prevent his getting the money paid which has been decreed for a\r\nstatue of Q. Publicius. In which matter I both ask as a favour and urge\r\nas a duty, that you should not consent to allow the honour of a man of\r\nhis character, and so close a friend of mine, to be lowered or hindered\r\nby your means. Farthermore, Licinius, who is known to you, a slave of my\r\nfriend Æsopus, has run away. He has been at Athens, living in the house\r\nof Patron the Epicurean as a free man. Thence he has made his way to\r\nAsia. Afterwards a certain Plato of Sardis, who is often at Athens, and\r\nhappened to be at Athens at the time that Licinius arrived there, having\r\nsubsequently learnt by a letter from Æsopus that he was an escaped\r\nslave, arrested the fellow, and put him into confinement at Ephesus; but\r\nwhether into the public prison, or into a slave mill, we could not\r\nclearly make out from his letter. But since he is at Ephesus, I should\r\nbe obliged if you would trace him in any manner open to you, and with\r\nall care either [send him] or bring him home with you. Don't take into\r\nconsideration the fellow's value: such a good-for-nothing is worth very\r\nlittle; but Æsopus is so much vexed at his slave's bad conduct and\r\naudacity, that you can do him no greater favour than by being the means\r\nof his recovering him.\r\n\r\nNow for the news that you chiefly desire. We have so completely lost the\r\nconstitution that Cato,[295] a young man of no sense, but yet a Roman\r\ncitizen and a Cato, scarcely got off with his life because, having\r\ndetermined to prosecute Gabinius for bribery, when the prætors could not\r\nbe approached for several days, and refused to admit anyone to their\r\npresence, he mounted the rostra in public meeting and called Pompey an\r\n\"unofficial dictator.\" No one ever had a narrower escape of being\r\nkilled. From this you may see the state of the whole Republic. People,\r\nhowever, shew no inclination to desert my cause. They make wonderful\r\nprofessions, offers of service, and promises: and, indeed, I have the\r\nhighest hopes and even greater spirit--so that I hope to get the better\r\nin the struggle, and feel confident in my mind that, in the present\r\nstate of the Republic, I need not fear even an accident. However, the\r\nmatter stands thus: if Clodius gives notice of an action against me, the\r\nwhole of Italy will rush to my support, so that I shall come off with\r\nmany times greater glory than before; but if he attempts the use of\r\nviolence, I hope, by the zeal not only of friends but also of opponents,\r\nto be able to meet force with force. All promise me the aid of\r\nthemselves, their friends, clients, freedmen, slaves, and, finally, of\r\ntheir money. Our old regiment of loyalists is warm in its zeal and\r\nattachment to me. If there were any who had formerly been comparatively\r\nhostile or lukewarm, they are now uniting themselves with the loyalists\r\nfrom hatred to these despots. Pompey makes every sort of promise, and so\r\ndoes Cæsar: but my confidence in them is not enough to induce me to drop\r\nany of my preparations. The tribunes-designate are friendly to us. The\r\nconsuls-designate make excellent professions. Some of the new prætors\r\nare very friendly and very brave citizens--Domitius, Nigidius, Memmius,\r\nLentulus[296]--the others are loyalists also, but these are eminently\r\nso. Wherefore keep a good heart and high hopes. However, I will keep you\r\nconstantly informed on particular events as they occur from day to day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: ἀλλ' αἰεί τινα φῶτα μέγαν καὶ καλὸν ἐδέγμην, \"but I ever\r\nexpected some big and handsome man\" (Hom. _Odyss._ ix. 513).

See XLIV, p. 109, and XLV, p. 111.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286: Reading _quam pro civitate sua_ for _prope quam civitatem\r\nsuam_. I think _prope_ and _pro_ (_pr_) might easily have been mistaken\r\nfor each other, and if the order of _quam_ and _pro_ (mistaken for\r\n_prope_) were once changed, the case of _civitate_ would follow. Prof.\r\nTyrrell, who writes the town _Blandus_, would read _molliorem_ for\r\n_nobiliorem_, and imagines a pun on the meaning of _Blandus_. But the\r\nname of the town seems certainly _Blaundus_, Βλαῦνδος, or Μλαῦνδος\r\n(Stephanus, Βλαῦδος); see Head, _Hist. Num._ p. 559: and Cicero, though\r\ngenerally punning on names, would hardly do so here, where he is making\r\na grave excuse.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287: Whom he called (Letter XXIX) \"a madman and a knave.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288: C.

The\r\ngovernor of Cilicia in the same period is not known; probably some one\r\nleft in charge by Pompey.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289: I have endeavoured to leave the English as ambiguous as\r\nthe Latin. Cicero may mean that he has done some good, for at the end of\r\nLetter XXIX he says that Quintus has improved in these points, and had\r\nbeen better in his second than in his first year. On the other hand, the\r\ncontext here seems rather to point to the meaning \"how _little_ good I\r\nhave done!\"--impatiently dismissing the subject of temper.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 290: These \"requisitionary letters\" were granted by a\r\nprovincial governor to certain persons requiring supplies, payment of\r\ndebts, or legal decisions in their favour in the provinces, or other\r\nprivileges, and, if carelessly granted, were open to much abuse. Cicero,\r\nin his own government of Cilicia, boasted that he had signed none such\r\nin six months. The ill-wishers of Quintus had apparently got hold of a\r\nnumber of these letters signed by him (having been first written out by\r\nthe suitors themselves and scarcely glanced at by him), and a selection\r\nof them published to prove his injustice or carelessness.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 291: The governor of a province would stand in such a matter\r\nin the place of the prætor in Rome, _i.e._, he would decide on questions\r\nof law, not of fact, as, whether a debt was due or not. However, Quintus\r\nperhaps only erred in the form of his injunction. He might forbid the\r\ndeceased's estate being touched till the question of Fundanius's debt\r\nwas decided; but in his letter he assumed (as he had no right to do)\r\nthat the claim was good. Substantially it seems to me that Quintus was\r\nright, and certainly in his appeal to him Cicero does not follow his own\r\ninjunction to disregard personal feelings.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292: ὀρθὰν τὰν ναῦν. Quintus had written, it seems, defiantly\r\nabout the slanders afloat against him, and had quoted two Greek\r\nproverbial sayings. The first is found in Stobæus, 108 (extract from\r\nTeles): \"It was a fine saying of the pilot, 'At least, Poseidon, a ship\r\nwell trimmed,'\" _i.e._, if you sink my ship, she shall at least go down\r\nwith honour. Quintus means, \"Whatever my enemies may do afterwards, I\r\nwill keep my province in a sound state as long as I am here.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: ἅπαξ θανεῖν, perhaps \"Better to die once for all than\r\ngive in to every unjust demand.\" The editors quote Æschylus, _Pr.

CULLEOLUS (IN ILLYRICUM)\r\n\r\nROME[297]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 59, ÆT. 47]\r\n\r\nMy friend L. Lucceius,[298] the most delightful fellow in the world, has\r\nexpressed in my presence amazingly warm thanks to you, saying that you\r\nhave given most complete and liberal promises to his agents. Since your\r\nwords have roused such gratitude in him, you may imagine how grateful he\r\nwill be for the thing itself, when, as I hope, you will have performed\r\nyour promise. In any case the people of Bullis have shewn that they\r\nintend to do Lucceius right according to the award of Pompey. But we\r\nhave very great need of the additional support of your wishes,\r\ninfluence, and prætorian authority. That you should give us these I beg\r\nyou again and again. And this will be particularly gratifying to me,\r\nbecause Lucceius's agents know, and Lucceius himself gathered from your\r\nletter to him, that no one's influence has greater weight with you than\r\nmine. I ask you once more, and reiterate my request, that he may find\r\nthat to be the case by practical experience.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 297: There is no direct means of dating these letters, as we\r\nhave no other information as to the proconsulship of Culleolus.\r\nIllyricum was not always a separate government, but was sometimes under\r\nthe governor of Macedonia, sometimes under the governor of Gaul. The\r\nindications of date are (1) Pompey is at home and often seen by Cicero,\r\ntherefore it is not between the spring of B.C. 67 and the end of 62; (2)\r\nit is not later than March, B.C. 58, because from that time for ten\r\nyears Cæsar was governor of Illyricum, and before he ceased to be so\r\nPompey had left Italy, never to return. Even if Culleolus was not\r\ngovernor of Illyricum, but of Macedonia, the same argument holds good,\r\nfor C. Antonius was in Macedonia B.C. 63-60, and Octavius from B.C. 60\r\nto March, B.C. 59. That is, Culleolus could not have been in Macedonia\r\nwhile Pompey was in Italy till after March, B.C. 59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 298: L. Lucceius, whom we have heard of before as a candidate\r\nfor the consulship with Cæsar, and whom we shall hear of again as the\r\nauthor of a history of the social and civil wars (Sulla and Marius), and\r\nas being asked to write on Cicero's consulship. He was a close friend of\r\nPompey, and took his side in B.C. 49 (Cæs. _B. C._ iii. 18). The people\r\nof Bullis owed Lucceius money, and Cicero asks for \"mandatory letters\"\r\nfrom Culleolus to get it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIV (F XIII, 41)\r\n\r\nTO L. CULLEOLUS (IN ILLYRICUM)\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 59, ÆT. 47]\r\n\r\nIn what you have done for the sake of L. Lucceius, I wish you to be\r\nfully aware that you have obliged a man who will be exceedingly\r\ngrateful; and that, while this is very much the case with Lucceius\r\nhimself, so also Pompey as often as he sees me--and he sees me very\r\noften--thanks you in no common terms. I add also, what I know will be\r\nexceedingly gratifying to you, that I am myself immensely delighted with\r\nyour kindness to Lucceius. For the rest, though I have no doubt that as\r\nyou acted before for my sake, so now, for the sake of your own\r\nconsistency, you will abide by your liberal intentions, yet I reiterate\r\nmy request to you with all earnestness, that what you first gave us\r\nreason to hope, and then actually carried out, you would be so good as\r\nto see extended and brought to a final completion by your means. I\r\nassure you, and I pledge my credit to it, that such a course will be\r\nexceedingly gratifying to both Lucceius and Pompey, and that you will be\r\nmaking a most excellent investment with them. About politics, and about\r\nthe business going on here, and what we are all thinking about, I wrote\r\nto you in full detail a few days ago, and delivered the letter to your\r\nservants. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS IN EXILE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58. Coss., L. Piso, A. Gabinius.]\r\n\r\n     We have no record in Cicero's correspondence of the final measures\r\n     taken by Clodius against him. We find him when the correspondence\r\n     for this year opens on his way to exile: all his boasts of staying\r\n     and fighting have been thrown to the winds. Clodius, indeed, had\r\n     not simply done what Cicero expected at the worst--impeached him.\r\n     He had gone more systematically to work. Among other measures\r\n     calculated to win popularity, he proposed a modification of the\r\n     _lex Ælia Fufia_, declaring it illegal for a magistrate to stop\r\n     legislative _comitia_ by \"watching the sky.\" Thus freed from one\r\n     hindrance, he next proposed and carried a law for the prosecution\r\n     of any magistrate who had put a citizen to death without trial\r\n     (_qui indemnatos cives necavisset_). Cicero at once recognized his\r\n     danger: if the people voted this law, a jury could scarcely fail to\r\n     condemn. The triumvirs would do nothing. Pompey, after all his\r\n     promises, avoided seeing Cicero as much as possible: Cæsar offered\r\n     him a _legatio_ again; and though he spoke against giving the law a\r\n     retrospective effect, he could not consistently object to the law\r\n     itself, and shewed no sign of desiring to shelter Cicero, except on\r\n     his consenting to leave Rome. Cicero then adopted the course which\r\n     was open to all citizens threatened with a prosecution--that of\r\n     going away from Rome--and started apparently with the view of going\r\n     to Malta. Whether it was wise or not, Cicero afterwards lamented\r\n     having taken this course, and thought that he had better have\r\n     braved the danger and stood his trial. It at any rate facilitated\r\n     the next move of Clodius, who proposed and carried a bill\r\n     forbidding Cicero \"fire and water\" within 500 (afterwards reduced\r\n     to 400) miles of Italy, and confiscating his property. Accordingly,\r\n     Cicero had to go much farther than he had intended. He crossed from\r\n     Brundisium to Dyrrachium, and proceeded along the _via Egnatia_ to\r\n     its terminus at Thessalonica, where he spent the autumn, B.C. 58.\r\n     In November, B.C. 58, he returned to Dyrrachium, ready for the\r\n     recall which he heard was imminent. Meanwhile his town house was\r\n     destroyed, its site made a _templum_, and a statue of Liberty set\r\n     up in it, and his villas at Tusculum and Antium dismantled. The\r\n     dangers of his position are not exaggerated in his letters, and may\r\n     account for much of their melancholy tone. He had lost the\r\n     protection of the laws, and any one of his many enemies meeting him\r\n     might have killed him with practical impunity. He seems to have\r\n     left Rome in April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLV (A III, 3)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nVIBO, APRIL\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nI hope I may see the day when I shall thank you for having compelled me\r\nto remain alive! At present I thoroughly repent it. But I beg you to\r\ncome and see me at Vibo at once, to which town I have for several\r\nreasons directed my journey.[299] But if you will only come there, I\r\nshall be able to consult you about my entire journey and exile. If you\r\ndon't do so, I shall be surprised, but I feel sure you will.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: Mod. _Monte Leone_, on the road to Rhegium, from which at\r\nthis time Cicero meant to cross to Sicily, and thence to Malta.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVI (A III, 2)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nNARES LUCANÆ,[300] APRIL\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nThe reason for having come this journey is that there was no place where\r\nI could be independent except on Sica's estate,[301] especially till the\r\nbill is emended,[302] and at the same time because I find that from this\r\nspot I can reach Brundisium, if you were only with me, but without you I\r\ncannot stay in those parts owing to Autronius.[303] At present, as I\r\nsaid in my previous letter, if you will come to me, we shall be able to\r\nform a plan for the whole business. I know the journey is troublesome,\r\nbut the whole calamity is full of troubles. I cannot write more, I am so\r\nheart-broken and dejected.

A copy of\r\nthe bill for my ruin was brought to me, in which the correction of which\r\nI had been told was to the effect that I might legally remain anywhere\r\nbeyond 400 miles. Since I was not allowed to go yonder,[304] I set out\r\ntowards Brundisium before the day for carrying the bill had come, both\r\nto prevent Sica, in whose house I was staying, from being ruined,[305]\r\nand because I was prevented from residing at Malta. So now make haste to\r\ncatch me up, if only I shall find any welcome there.[306] At present I\r\nreceive kind invitations. But about the rest of my journey I am nervous.\r\nTruly, my dear Pomponius, I am very sorry I consented to live: in which\r\nmatter you exercised the chief influence with me.

Wherefore I beg you to do your best to overtake me promptly,\r\nwhich will be easier for you to do since the law about the province of\r\nMacedonia has now been passed.[307] I would urge you at greater length\r\nwere it not that with you facts speak for me.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 307: One of Clodius's concessions to the consuls, to keep them\r\nquiet, was to get Macedonia assigned by a _lex_ to L.

All I ask you is to retain the same affection for me,\r\nsince it was always myself you loved. For I am the same man: my enemies\r\nhave taken what was mine, they have not taken myself.

My disappointment in\r\nthis is only another item in the long list of my misfortunes.[308] I\r\nmean to go to Asia, to Cyzicus for choice. I commend my family to you. I\r\nam very wretched and can scarcely support my life.\r\n\r\nFrom near Tarentum, 17 April.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 308: We suppose that Cicero has heard from Atticus that he is\r\nnot going to be at Tarentum or Brundisium, for he writes before arriving\r\nat either.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXI (F XIV, 4)\r\n\r\nTO TERENTIA, TULLIOLA, AND YOUNG CICERO (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nBRUNDISIUM, 29 APRIL\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nYes, I do write to you less often than I might, because, though I am\r\nalways wretched, yet when I write to you or read a letter from you, I am\r\nin such floods of tears that I cannot endure it. Oh, that I had clung\r\nless to life! I should at least never have known real sorrow, or not\r\nmuch of it, in my life. Yet if fortune has reserved for me _any_ hope of\r\nrecovering at any time any position again, I was not utterly wrong to do\r\nso: if these miseries are to be permanent, I only wish, my dear, to see\r\nyou as soon as possible and to die in your arms, since neither gods,\r\nwhom you have worshipped with such pure devotion, nor men, whom I have\r\never served, have made us any return. I have been thirteen days at\r\nBrundisium in the house of M. Lænius Flaccus, a very excellent man, who\r\nhas despised the risk to his fortunes and civil existence in comparison\r\nto keeping me safe, nor has been induced by the penalty of a most\r\niniquitous law to refuse me the rights and good offices of hospitality\r\nand friendship. May I some time have the opportunity of repaying him!\r\nFeel gratitude I always shall. I set out from Brundisium on the 29th of\r\nApril,[309] and intend going through Macedonia to Cyzicus. What a fall!\r\nWhat a disaster! What can I say? Should I ask you to come--a woman of\r\nweak health and broken spirit? Should I refrain from asking you? Am I to\r\nbe without you, then? I think the best course is this: if there is any\r\nhope of my restoration, stay to promote it and push the thing on: but\r\nif, as I fear, it proves hopeless, pray come to me by any means in your\r\npower. Be sure of this, that if I have you I shall not think myself\r\nwholly lost. But what is to become of my darling Tullia? You must see to\r\nthat now: I can think of nothing. But certainly, however things turn\r\nout, we must do everything to promote that poor little girl's married\r\nhappiness and reputation. Again, what is my boy Cicero to do? Let him,\r\nat any rate, be ever in my bosom and in my arms.[310] I can't write\r\nmore. A fit of weeping hinders me. I don't know how you have got on;\r\nwhether you are left in possession of anything, or have been, as I fear,\r\nentirely plundered. Piso, as you say, I hope will always be our friend.\r\nAs to the manumission of the slaves you need not be uneasy. To begin\r\nwith, the promise made to yours was that you would treat them according\r\nas each severally deserved. So far Orpheus has behaved well, besides him\r\nno one very markedly so. With the rest of the slaves the arrangement is\r\nthat, if my property is forfeited, they should become my freedmen,\r\nsupposing them to be able to maintain at law that status.[311] But if my\r\nproperty remained in my ownership, they were to continue slaves, with\r\nthe exception of a very few. But these are trifles. To return to your\r\nadvice, that I should keep up my courage and not give up hope of\r\nrecovering my position, I only wish that there were any good grounds for\r\nentertaining such a hope. As it is, when, alas! shall I get a letter\r\nfrom you? Who will bring it me? I would have waited for it at\r\nBrundisium, but the sailors would not allow it, being unwilling to lose\r\na favourable wind. For the rest, put as dignified a face on the matter\r\nas you can, my dear Terentia. Our life is over: we have had our day: it\r\nis not any fault of ours that has ruined us, but our virtue. I have made\r\nno false step, except in not losing my life when I lost my honours. But\r\nsince our children preferred my living, let us bear everything else,\r\nhowever intolerable. And yet I, who encourage you, cannot encourage\r\nmyself. I have sent that faithful fellow Clodius Philhetærus home,\r\nbecause he was hampered with weakness of the eyes. Sallustius seems\r\nlikely to outdo everybody in his attentions. Pescennius is exceedingly\r\nkind to me; and I have hopes that he will always be attentive to you.\r\nSica had said that he would accompany me; but he has left Brundisium.\r\nTake the greatest possible care of your health, and believe me that I am\r\nmore affected by your distress than my own. My dear Terentia, most\r\nfaithful and best of wives, and my darling little daughter, and that\r\nlast hope of my race, Cicero, good-bye!\r\n\r\n29 April, from Brundisium.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: Reading _prid.

See Letter CXCII.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXII (A III, 7)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nBRUNDISIUM, 29 APRIL\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nI arrived at Brundisium on the 17th of April. On that day your slaves\r\ndelivered me your letter, and some other slaves, on the next day but\r\none, brought me another. As to your invitation and advice to stay at\r\nyour house in Epirus, your kindness is most gratifying, and far from\r\nbeing a novelty. It is a plan that would have exactly suited my wishes,\r\nif I might have spent all my time there: for I loathe a crowd of\r\nvisitors, I can scarcely bear the light, and that solitude, especially\r\nin a spot so familiar, would have been the reverse of disagreeable. But\r\nto put up there as a mere stage in my journey! In the first place it is\r\nfar out of my way, and in the next it is only four days from Autronius\r\nand the rest, and in the third place you are not there. Had I been going\r\nto reside permanently, a fortified castle would have been an advantage,\r\nbut to one only passing through it is unnecessary. Why, if I had not\r\nbeen afraid, I should have made for Athens[312]--there were\r\ncircumstances that made me much wish to go--but as it is, I have enemies\r\nin the neighbourhood, you are not there, and I fear they[313] might hold\r\neven that town not to be the legal distance from Italy, nor do you\r\nmention by what day I am to expect you. As to your urging me to remain\r\nalive, you carry one point--that I should not lay violent hands upon\r\nmyself: the other you cannot bring to pass--that I should not regret my\r\npolicy and my continuance in life. For what is there to attach me to it,\r\nespecially if the hope which accompanied me on my departure is\r\nnon-existent? I will not attempt to enumerate all the miseries into\r\nwhich I have fallen through the extreme injustice and unprincipled\r\nconduct, not so much of my enemies, as of those who were jealous of me,\r\nbecause I do not wish to stir up a fresh burst of grief in myself, or\r\ninvite you to share the same sorrow. I say this deliberately--that no\r\none was ever afflicted with so heavy a calamity, that no one had ever\r\ngreater cause to wish for death; while I have let slip the time when I\r\nmight have sought it most creditably. Henceforth death can never heal,\r\nit can only end my sorrow.[314] In politics I perceive that you collect\r\nall circumstances that you think may inspire me with a hope of a change:\r\nand though they are insignificant, yet, since you will have it so, let\r\nus have patience. In spite of what you say, you will catch us up if you\r\nmake haste. For I will either come into Epirus to be near you, or I will\r\ntravel slowly through Candavia.[315] My hesitation about Epirus is not\r\ncaused by vacillation on my part, but by the fact that I do not know\r\nwhere I am likely to see my brother. As to him, I neither know how I am\r\nto see him, nor how I shall let him go. That is the greatest and most\r\ndistressing of all my distresses. I would indeed have written to you\r\noftener, and at greater length, had it not been that sorrow, while it\r\nhas affected all parts of my intellect, has above all entirely destroyed\r\nmy faculty for this kind of writing. I long to see you. Take care of\r\nyour health.\r\n\r\nBrundisium, 29 April.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: He means that had it not been for enemies in Greece and\r\nEpirus, he should not only have gone as far south as Epirus, but\r\nfarther--to Athens. There is a good deal to be said for Schutz's\r\nreading, _Achaiam_ for _Athenas_, but as the MS. reading can be\r\nexplained, it is safer to keep it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: The Clodian party at Rome. \"That town\" is Athens.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 314: \"I have lost my chance of dying with honour; henceforth\r\ndeath may end my grief, but cannot heal my damaged reputation.\" _Reliqua\r\ntempora_, _i.e._, other opportunities of suicide.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 315: A mountain range in Illyria, over which the _via Egnatia_\r\npasses (mod. _Elbassán_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIII (A III, 8)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTHESSALONICA, 29 MAY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nI wrote to you at Brundisium, when on the point of starting, the reasons\r\nfor my not going to Epirus: namely, the proximity of Achaia, which was\r\nfull of enemies of the most unscrupulous character, and secondly, the\r\ndifficulty of leaving it when I wished to resume my journey. Added to\r\nthis, while I was at Dyrrachium two messages reached me: the first, that\r\nmy brother was coming from Ephesus to Athens by ship; the second, that\r\nhe was coming through Macedonia by land. Accordingly, I sent a message\r\nto meet him at Athens, telling him to come thence to Thessalonica. I\r\nmyself continued my journey, and arrived at Thessalonica on the 23rd of\r\nMay, but have no certain intelligence about his journey except that he\r\nhad left Ephesus some time ago. At present I am feeling very nervous as\r\nto what steps are being taken at Rome. Although you say in one of your\r\nletters, dated the 15th of May, that you hear that he will be vigorously\r\nprosecuted, in another you say that things are calming down. But then\r\nthe latter is dated a day before the former; which makes me all the more\r\nanxious. So while my own personal sorrow is every day tearing my heart\r\nand wearing out my strength, this additional anxiety indeed scarcely\r\nleaves me any life at all. However, the voyage itself was very\r\ndifficult, and he perhaps, being uncertain where I was, has taken some\r\nother course. For my freedman Phaetho saw nothing of him. Phaetho was\r\ndriven by the wind from Ilium[316] to Macedonia, and met me at Pella.\r\nHow formidable other circumstances are I am fully aware, and I don't\r\nknow what to say to you. I fear everything, nor is there any misery\r\nwhich would not seem possible in my present unfortunate position.\r\nMiserable as I still am in the midst of my heavy trials and sorrows, now\r\nthat this anxiety is added to them, I remain at Thessalonica in a state\r\nof suspense without venturing upon any step whatever.\r\n\r\nNow to answer you. I have not seen Cæcilius Trypho. I comprehend from\r\nyour letter what you and Pompey have been saying. That any movement in\r\npolitics is impending I cannot see as clearly as you either see, or\r\nperhaps only suggest for my consolation. For, as the case of Tigranes\r\nwas passed over, all hope of a rupture is at an end.[317] You bid me\r\nthank Varro: I will do so; also Hypsæus.[318] As to your advice not to\r\ngo farther off till the _acta_[319] of the month of May reach me, I\r\nthink I shall do as you suggest. But where to stay? I have not yet come\r\nto any decision. And indeed my mind is so uneasy about Quintus, that I\r\ncan determine on nothing. However, I will let you know immediately. From\r\nthe incoherent nature of my letters I think you will understand the\r\nagitation of my mind, caused not so much by my misery, though I have\r\nbeen overwhelmed by an incredible and unparalleled calamity, as by the\r\nrecollection of my blunder. For by whose unprincipled advice I was egged\r\non and betrayed you certainly now perceive,[320] and oh that you had\r\nperceived it before, and had not given your whole mind to lamentation\r\nalong with me! Wherefore, when you are told that I am prostrate and\r\nunmanned with grief, consider that I am more distressed at my own folly\r\nthan at the result of it, in having believed a man whom I did not think\r\nto be treacherous. My writing is impeded both by the recollection of my\r\nown disasters, and by my alarm about my brother. Yes, pray look after\r\nand direct all the affairs you mention. Terentia expresses the warmest\r\ngratitude to you. I have sent you a copy of the letter which I have\r\nwritten to Pompey.\r\n\r\nThessalonica, 29 May.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 316: Reading _ab Ilio_ with Madvig for _ab illo_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 317: Tigranes, a son of the king of Armenia, was brought to\r\nRome by Pompey to adorn his triumph, and put under the care of Lucius\r\nFlavius. This prince was, for a bribe, released by Clodius by a trick,\r\nand the attempt to get him away led to a scuffle in which lives were\r\nlost. Pompey regarded this as a slight upon himself, and his partisan,\r\nthe consul Gabinius, attempted to prevent it. But both were hustled in\r\nthe forum and treated with insults. The hope of a breach in the\r\ntriumvirate arose from the supposition that Clodius had the support of\r\nCæsar in his high-handed proceeding (Dio, xxxviii. 30; Plut. _Pomp._ 48;\r\nAscon. 47).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: P. Plautius Hypsæus, who had been Pompey's quæstor and on\r\nintimate terms with him. He had been, it seems, interesting himself on\r\nCicero's behalf.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: The gazette of public transactions and measures passed in\r\nthe senate, which was sent round to the provinces. We shall hear of it\r\nagain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: The next letter shews that he means Hortensius. The\r\nblunder which he complains of having committed, by the advice of\r\nHortensius, is that of having left Rome, rather than stay and brave the\r\nimpeachment.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIV (A III, 9)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTHESSALONICA, 13 JUNE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nMy brother Quintus having quitted Asia before the 1st of May, and\r\narrived at Athens on the 15th, he would have to make great haste to\r\nprevent proceedings being commenced against him in his absence,\r\nsupposing there to be some one who was not content with the misfortunes\r\nwe have already sustained. Accordingly, I preferred that he should hurry\r\non to Rome rather than come to me; and at the same time--for I will tell\r\nyou the truth, and it will give you a notion of the extent of my\r\nwretchedness--I could not make up my mind to see him, devotedly attached\r\nto me as he is, and a man of most tender feelings, or to obtrude upon\r\nhim my miseries and ruin in all their wretchedness, or to endure their\r\nbeing seen by him. And I was besides afraid of what certainly would have\r\nhappened--that he would not have had the resolution to leave me. I had\r\never before my eyes the time when he would either have to dismiss his\r\nlictors,[321] or be violently torn from my arms. The prospect of this\r\nbitter pain I have avoided by the other bitter pain of not seeing my\r\nbrother. It is all you, who advised me to continue living, that have\r\nforced me into this distressful position. Accordingly, I am paying the\r\npenalty of my error. However, I am sustained by your letter, from which\r\nI easily perceive how high your own hopes are. This did give me some\r\nconsolation, but only, after all, till you passed from the mention of\r\nPompey to the passage beginning \"Now try and win over Hortensius and\r\nmen of that sort.\" In heaven's name, my dear Pomponius, don't you yet\r\nperceive by whose means, by whose treachery, by whose dishonest advice,\r\nI have been ruined? But all this I will discuss with you when we meet. I\r\nwill only say this much, which I think you know: it is not my enemies,\r\nbut my jealous rivals, that have ruined me. Now, however, if things are\r\nreally as you hope, I will keep up my spirits, and will rely upon the\r\nhope on which you bid me rely. But if, as I myself think, this proves\r\nillusory, what I was not allowed to do at the best time shall be done at\r\na worse.[322] Terentia often expresses her gratitude to you. For myself\r\none of my miseries also consists in fear--the business of my unhappy\r\nbrother. If I could only know how it stands, I should know what I ought\r\nto do. Personally, the hope of the advantages and of the letters you\r\nmention keeps me still, as you advise, at Thessalonica. If I get any\r\nnews, I shall know what I ought to do about the rest. Yes, if, as you\r\nsay in your letter, you left Rome on the 1st of June, you will soon see\r\nus. I have sent you a letter which I wrote to Pompey.\r\n\r\nThessalonica, 15 June.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: Because, though a provincial governor retained his\r\nlictors till he reached Rome, he was bound to go straight home or\r\ndismiss them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 322: _I.e._, suicide.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXV (Q FR I, 3)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (ON HIS WAY TO ROME)\r\n\r\nTHESSALONICA, 15 JUNE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nBrother! Brother! Brother! did you really fear that I had been induced\r\nby some angry feeling to send slaves to you without a letter? Or even\r\nthat I did not wish to see you? I to be angry with you! Is it possible\r\nfor me to be angry with you? Why, one would think that it was you that\r\nbrought me low! Your enemies, your unpopularity, that miserably ruined\r\nme, and not I that unhappily ruined you! The fact is, the much-praised\r\nconsulate of mine has deprived me of you, of children, country, fortune;\r\nfrom you I should hope it will have taken nothing but myself. Certainly\r\non your side I have experienced nothing but what was honourable and\r\ngratifying: on mine you have grief for my fall and fear for your own,\r\nregret, mourning, desertion. _I_ not wish to see you? The truth is\r\nrather that I was unwilling to be seen by you. For you would not have\r\nseen your brother--not the brother you had left, not the brother you\r\nknew, not him to whom you had with mutual tears bidden farewell as he\r\nfollowed you on your departure for your province: not a trace even or\r\nfaint image of him, but rather what I may call the likeness of a living\r\ncorpse. And oh that you had sooner seen me or heard of me as a corpse!\r\nOh that I could have left you to survive, not my life merely, but my\r\nundiminished rank! But I call all the gods to witness that the one\r\nargument which recalled me from death was, that all declared that to\r\nsome extent your life depended upon mine. In which matter I made an\r\nerror and acted culpably. For if I had died, that death itself would\r\nhave given clear evidence of my fidelity and love to you. As it is, I\r\nhave allowed you to be deprived of my aid, though I am alive, and with\r\nme still living to need the help of others; and my voice, of all others,\r\nto fail when dangers threatened my family, which had so often been\r\nsuccessfully used in the defence of the merest strangers. For as to the\r\nslaves coming to you without a letter, the real reason (for you see that\r\nit was not anger) was a deadness of my faculties, and a seemingly\r\nendless deluge of tears and sorrows. How many tears do you suppose these\r\nvery words have cost me? As many as I know they will cost you to read\r\nthem! Can I ever refrain from thinking of you or ever think of you\r\nwithout tears? For when I miss you, is it only a brother that I miss?\r\nRather it is a brother of almost my own age in the charm of his\r\ncompanionship, a son in his consideration for my wishes, a father in the\r\nwisdom of his advice! What pleasure did I ever have without you, or you\r\nwithout me? And what must my case be when at the same time I miss a\r\ndaughter: How affectionate! how modest! how clever! The express image of\r\nmy face, of my speech, of my very soul! Or again a son, the prettiest\r\nboy, the very joy of my heart? Cruel inhuman monster that I am, I\r\ndismissed him from my arms better schooled in the world than I could\r\nhave wished: for the poor child began to understand what was going on.\r\nSo, too, your own son, your own image, whom my little Cicero loved as a\r\nbrother, and was now beginning to respect as an elder brother! Need I\r\nmention also how I refused to allow my unhappy wife--the truest of\r\nhelpmates--to accompany me, that there might be some one to protect the\r\nwrecks of the calamity which had fallen on us both, and guard our common\r\nchildren? Nevertheless, to the best of my ability, I did write a letter\r\nto you, and gave it to your freedman Philogonus, which, I believe, was\r\ndelivered to you later on; and in this I repeated the advice and\r\nentreaty, which had been already transmitted to you as a message from me\r\nby my slaves, that you should go on with your journey and hasten to\r\nRome. For, in the first place, I desired your protection, in case there\r\nwere any of my enemies whose cruelty was not yet satisfied by my fall.\r\nIn the next place, I dreaded the renewed lamentation which our meeting\r\nwould cause: while I could not have borne your departure, and was afraid\r\nof the very thing you mention in your letter--that you would be unable\r\nto tear yourself away. For these reasons the supreme pain of not seeing\r\nyou--and nothing more painful or more wretched could, I think, have\r\nhappened to the most affectionate and united of brothers--was a less\r\nmisery than would have been such a meeting followed by such a parting.\r\nNow, if you can, though I, whom you always regarded as a brave man,\r\ncannot do so, rouse yourself and collect your energies in view of any\r\ncontest you may have to confront. I hope, if my hope has anything to go\r\nupon, that your own spotless character and the love of your fellow\r\ncitizens, and even remorse for my treatment, may prove a certain\r\nprotection to you. But if it turns out that you are free from personal\r\ndanger, you will doubtless do whatever you think can be done for me. In\r\nthat matter, indeed, many write to me at great length and declare that\r\nthey have hopes; but I personally cannot see what hope there is, since\r\nmy enemies have the greatest influence, while my friends have in some\r\ncases deserted, in others even betrayed me, fearing perhaps in my\r\nrestoration a censure on their own treacherous conduct. But how matters\r\nstand with you I would have you ascertain and report to me. In any case\r\nI shall continue to live as long as you shall need me, in view of any\r\ndanger you may have to undergo: longer than that I cannot go on in this\r\nkind of life. For there is neither wisdom nor philosophy with sufficient\r\nstrength to sustain such a weight of grief. I know that there has been a\r\ntime for dying, more honourable and more advantageous; and this is not\r\nthe only one of my many omissions, which, if I should choose to bewail,\r\nI should merely be increasing your sorrow and emphasizing my own\r\nstupidity. But one thing I am not bound to do, and it is in fact\r\nimpossible--remain in a life so wretched and so dishonoured any longer\r\nthan your necessities, or some well-grounded hope, shall demand. For I,\r\nwho was lately supremely blessed in brother, children, wife, wealth, and\r\nin the very nature of that wealth, while in position, influence,\r\nreputation, and popularity, I was inferior to none, however\r\ndistinguished--I cannot, I repeat, go on longer lamenting over myself\r\nand those dear to me in a life of such humiliation as this, and in a\r\nstate of such utter ruin. Wherefore, what do you mean by writing to me\r\nabout negotiating a bill of exchange? As though I were not now wholly\r\ndependent on your means! And that is just the very thing in which I see\r\nand feel, to my misery, of what a culpable act I have been guilty in\r\nsquandering to no purpose the money which I received from the treasury\r\nin your name,[323] while you have to satisfy your creditors out of the\r\nvery vitals of yourself and your son. However, the sum mentioned in your\r\nletter has been paid to M. Antonius, and the same amount to Cæpio. For\r\nme the sum at present in my hands is sufficient for what I contemplate\r\ndoing. For in either case--whether I am restored or given up in\r\ndespair--I shall not want any more money. For yourself, if you are\r\nmolested, I think you should apply to Crassus and Calidius. I don't know\r\nhow far Hortensius is to be trusted. Myself, with the most elaborate\r\npretence of affection and the closest daily intimacy, he treated with\r\nthe most utter want of principle and the most consummate treachery, and\r\nQ. Arrius helped him in it: acting under whose advice, promises, and\r\ninjunctions, I was left helpless to fall into this disaster. But this\r\nyou will keep dark for fear they might injure you. Take care also--and\r\nit is on this account that I think you should cultivate Hortensius\r\nhimself by means of Pomponius--that the epigram on the _lex\r\nAurelia_[324] attributed to you when candidate for the ædileship is not\r\nproved by false testimony to be yours. For there is nothing that I am so\r\nafraid of as that, when people understand how much pity for me your\r\nprayers and your acquittal will rouse, they may attack you with all the\r\ngreater violence. Messalla I reckon as really attached to you: Pompey I\r\nregard as still pretending only. But may you never have to put these\r\nthings to the test! And that prayer I would have offered to the gods had\r\nthey not ceased to listen to prayers of mine. However, I do pray that\r\nthey may be content with these endless miseries of ours; among which,\r\nafter all, there is no discredit for any wrong thing done--sorrow is the\r\nbeginning and end, sorrow that punishment is most severe when our\r\nconduct has been most unexceptionable. As to my daughter and yours and\r\nmy young Cicero, why should I recommend them to you, my dear brother?\r\nRather I grieve that their orphan state will cause you no less sorrow\r\nthan it does me. Yet as long as you are uncondemned they will not be\r\nfatherless. The rest, by my hopes of restoration and the privilege of\r\ndying in my fatherland, my tears will not allow me to write! Terentia\r\nalso I would ask you to protect, and to write me word on every subject.\r\nBe as brave as the nature of the case admits.\r\n\r\nThessalonica, 13 June.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 323: See pp. 92, 107.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 324: Quintus was a candidate in B.C. 66 for the ædileship of\r\nthe following year. The _lex Aurelia_, which divided the juries between\r\nthe senators, equites, and _tribuni ærarii_, was passed in Pompey's\r\nfirst consulship, B.C. 70. As this was the compromise in the matter of\r\nthe _iudicia_ favoured by Pompey, Hortensius, and the like, an attack on\r\nit would be likely to give offence.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVI (A III, 10)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTHESSALONICA, 17 JUNE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nThe public transactions up to the 25th of May I have learnt from your\r\nletter. I am waiting for the rest, as you advised, at Thessalonica; and\r\nwhen they arrive I shall be better able to decide where to be. For if\r\nthere is any reason, if any action is being taken, if I shall see any\r\nhopes, I shall either wait in the same place or go to your house; but\r\nif, as you say, these hopes have vanished into air, I shall look out for\r\nsomething else. At present you do not give me any indication except the\r\ndisagreement of those friends of yours, which, however, arises between\r\nthem on every kind of subject rather than myself. Therefore I don't see\r\nwhat good it is to me. However, as long as you all will have me hope, I\r\nshall obey you. For as to your scoldings so frequent and so severe, and\r\nyour saying that I am faint-hearted, I would ask you what misery is\r\nthere so heavy as not to be included in my disfranchisement? Did anyone\r\never fall from such a high position, in so good a cause, with such\r\nendowments of genius, wisdom and popularity, with such powerful supports\r\nfrom all loyalists? Can I forget what I was, and not feel what I am? Of\r\nwhat honour, of what glory, of what children, of what means, of what a\r\nbrother I am deprived? This last, indeed, to draw your attention to a\r\nnew kind of disaster--though I valued him, and always had done so, more\r\nthan myself--I have avoided seeing, lest I should behold his grief and\r\nmourning, or lest I--whom he had left in the highest prosperity--should\r\nobtrude myself upon him in a state of ruin and humiliation. I pass over\r\nthe other particulars that are past bearing: for I am prevented by my\r\ntears. And here, let me ask, am I to be blamed for my grief, or for the\r\nunfortunate mistake of not retaining these advantages (and I could\r\neasily have done so, had not a plot for my destruction been hatched\r\nwithin my own walls), or at least of not losing them without losing my\r\nlife at the same time? My purpose in writing these words is that you\r\nshould rather console me, as you do, than think me deserving of\r\ncorrection or chiding; and the reason of the comparative brevity of my\r\nletters is, in the first place, that I am hindered by outbursts of\r\nsorrow, and, in the second place, that I have news to expect from Rome\r\nrather than any to communicate myself. But when that news arrives I will\r\nlet you know my plans. Pray, as you have done hitherto, write to me on\r\nas many subjects as possible, that I may not be ignorant of any possible\r\nthing there is to know.\r\n\r\nThessalonica, 17 June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVII (A III, 11)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTHESSALONICA, 27 JUNE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nI have been kept at Thessalonica up to this time as well by your letter\r\nand some good news (which, however, did not rest on the best authority),\r\nand the expectation of hearing from you all at Rome, as by the fact that\r\nyou advised my doing so. When I receive the letters which I expect, if\r\nthere turns out to be the hope which rumour brings me, I shall go to\r\nyour house;[325] if otherwise, I will inform you of what I have done.\r\nPray go on, as you are doing, and help me by your exertions, advice, and\r\ninfluence. Cease now consoling me, but yet don't chide me; for when you\r\ndo that, I fail to recognize your affection and regret! Yet I believe\r\nyou to be so distressed yourself at my wretchedness, that it is not\r\nwithin anyone's power to console you. Give your support to Quintus, my\r\nbest and kindest of brothers. Pray write to me fully on everything.\r\n\r\n27 June.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 325: _I.e._, to the house of Atticus at Buthrotum.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVIII (A III, 12)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTHESSALONICA, 17 JULY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nWell, you argue earnestly as to what hope is to be entertained, and\r\nespecially through the action of the senate, and yet you mention that\r\nthe clause of the bill is being posted up, in virtue of which the\r\nsubject is forbidden to be mentioned in the senate. Accordingly, not a\r\nword is said about it. In these circumstances you find fault with me for\r\ndistressing myself, when the fact is I am already more distressed than\r\nanybody ever was, as you know very well. You hold out hope as a\r\nconsequence of the elections. What hope can there be with the same man\r\ntribune, and a consul-designate who is my enemy?[326] But you have dealt\r\nme a blow in what you say about my speech having got abroad.[327] Pray\r\ndo your best to heal that wound, as you express it. I did indeed write\r\none some time ago, in a fit of anger at what he had first composed\r\nagainst me; but I had taken such pains to suppress it, that I thought it\r\nwould never get into circulation. How it has leaked out I cannot think.\r\nBut since the occasion never arose for my having a word of dispute with\r\nhim, and since it appears to me to be more carelessly written than my\r\nother speeches, I think it might be maintained not to be by me. Pray\r\nlook after this if you think I can do anything to remedy the mischief;\r\nbut if my ruin is inevitable, I don't so much care about it. I am still\r\nlying idle in the same place, without conversation, without being able\r\nto think. Though, as you say, I have \"intimated\" to you my desire that\r\nyou should come to me, yet it is now clear to me[328] that you are doing\r\nme useful service where you are, but could not give me even a word of\r\nrelief here. I cannot write any more, nor have I anything to say: I am\r\nrather waiting to hear from you all.\r\n\r\nThessalonica, 17 July.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 326: Clodius was not re-elected, and Q.

The elections, I presume,\r\nare over; and when they were over you say that he was of opinion that my\r\ncase should be mooted. If I seem foolish to you for entertaining hopes,\r\nit is at your bidding that I do so: yet I know that you have in your\r\nletters been usually inclined rather to check me and my hopes. Now pray\r\nwrite distinctly what your view is. I know that I have fallen into this\r\ndistress from numerous errors of my own. If certain accidents have in\r\nany degree corrected those errors, I shall be less sorry that I\r\npreserved my life then and am still living. Owing to the constant\r\ntraffic along the road[329] and the daily expectation of political\r\nchange, I have as yet not removed from Thessalonica. But now I am being\r\nforced away, not by Plancius--for he, indeed, wishes to keep me\r\nhere--but by the nature of the place, which is not at all calculated for\r\nthe residence of a disfranchised man in such a state of sorrow. I have\r\nnot gone to Epirus, as I had said I would, because all of a sudden the\r\nmessages and letters that arrived have all indicated it to be\r\nunnecessary for me to be in the immediate neighbourhood of Italy. From\r\nthis place, as soon as I have heard something about the elections, I\r\nshall set my face towards Asia, but to what particular part I am not yet\r\ncertain: however, you shall know.\r\n\r\nThessalonica, 21 July.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 329: The _via Egnatia_, the road across Macedonia, which was\r\none of the great channels of communication between Rome and the East,\r\nand which terminated at Thessalonica.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXX (A III, 13)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTHESSALONICA, 5 AUGUST\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nAs to my having written you word that I meant to go to Epirus, I changed\r\nmy plan when I saw that my hope was vanishing and fading away, and did\r\nnot remove from Thessalonica. I resolved to remain there until I heard\r\nfrom you on the subject mentioned in your last letter, namely, that\r\nthere was going to be some motion made in the senate on my case\r\nimmediately after the elections, and that Pompey had told you so.\r\nWherefore, as the elections are over and I have no letter from you, I\r\nshall consider it as though you had written to say that nothing has come\r\nof it, and I shall not feel annoyed at having been buoyed up by a hope\r\nwhich did not keep me long in suspense. But the movement, which you said\r\nin your letter that you foresaw as likely to be to my advantage, people\r\narriving here tell me will not occur.[330] My sole remaining hope is in\r\nthe tribunes-designate: and if I wait to see how that turns out, you\r\nwill have no reason to think of me as having been wanting to my own\r\ncause or the wishes of my friends. As to your constantly finding fault\r\nwith me for being so overwhelmed by my misfortune, you ought to pardon\r\nme when you see that I have sustained a more crushing blow than anyone\r\nyou have ever seen or heard of. As to your saying that you are told that\r\nmy intellect in even affected by grief, that is not so; my intellect is\r\nquite sound. Oh that it had been as much so in the hour of danger! when\r\nI found those, to whom I thought my safety was the dearest object of\r\ntheir life, most bitterly and unfeelingly hostile: who, when they saw\r\nthat I had somewhat lost my balance from fear, left nothing undone which\r\nmalice and treachery could suggest in giving me the final push, to my\r\nutter ruin. Now, as I must go to Cyzicus, where I shall get letters\r\nmore rarely, I beg you to write me word all the more carefully of\r\neverything you may think I ought to know. Be sure you are affectionate\r\nto my brother Quintus: if in all my misery I still leave him with rights\r\nundiminished, I shall not consider myself utterly ruined.\r\n\r\n5 August.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 330: The probable split among the triumvirs, alluded to in\r\nLetter LXIII.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXI (Q FR I, 4)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTHESSALONICA, AUGUST\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nI beg you, my dear brother, if you and all my family have been ruined by\r\nmy single misfortune, not to attribute it to dishonesty and bad conduct\r\non my part, rather than to short-sightedness and the wretched state I\r\nwas in. I have committed no fault except in trusting those whom I\r\nbelieved to be bound by the most sacred obligation not to deceive me, or\r\nwhom I thought to be even interested in not doing so. All my most\r\nintimate, nearest and dearest friends were either alarmed for themselves\r\nor jealous of me: the result was that all I lacked was good faith on the\r\npart of my friends and caution on my own.[331] But if your own blameless\r\ncharacter and the compassion of the world prove sufficient to preserve\r\nyou at this juncture from molestation, you can, of course, observe\r\nwhether any hope of restoration is left for me. For Pomponius, Sestius,\r\nand my son-in-law Piso have caused me as yet to stay at Thessalonica,\r\nforbidding me, on account of certain impending movements, to increase my\r\ndistance. But in truth I am awaiting the result more on account of their\r\nletters than from any firm hope of my own. For what can I hope with an\r\nenemy possessed of the most formidable power, with my detractors masters\r\nof the state, with friends unfaithful, with numbers of people jealous?\r\nHowever, of the new tribunes there is one, it is true, most warmly\r\nattached to me--Sestius--and I hope Curius, Milo, Fadius, Fabricius;\r\nbut still there is Clodius in violent opposition, who even when out of\r\noffice will be able to stir up the passions of the mob by the help of\r\nthat same gang, and then there will be found some one also to veto the\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nSuch a state of things was not put before me when I was leaving Rome,\r\nbut I often used to be told that I was certain to return in three days\r\nwith the greatest _éclat_. \"What made you go, then?\" you will say. What,\r\nindeed! Many circumstances concurred to throw me off my balance--the\r\ndefection of Pompey, the hostility of the consuls, and of the prætors\r\nalso, the timidity of the _publicani_, the armed bands. The tears of my\r\nfriends prevented me seeking refuge in death, which would certainly have\r\nbeen the best thing for my honour, the best escape from unbearable\r\nsorrows. But I have written to you on this subject in the letter I gave\r\nto Phaetho. Now that you have been plunged into griefs and troubles,\r\nsuch as no one ever was before, if the compassion of the world can\r\nlighten our common misfortune, you will, it seems, score a success\r\nbeyond belief! But if we are both utterly ruined--ah me!--I shall have\r\nbeen the absolute destruction of my whole family, to whom I used to be\r\nat least no discredit! But pray, as I said in a previous letter to you,\r\nlook into the business, test it thoroughly, and write to me with the\r\ncandour which our situation demands, and not as your affection for me\r\nwould dictate. I shall retain my life as long as I shall think that it\r\nis in your interest for me to do so, or that it ought to be preserved\r\nwith a view to future hope. You will find Sestius most friendly to us,\r\nand I believe that Lentulus, the coming consul, will also be so for your\r\nsake. However, deeds are not so easy as words. You will see what is\r\nwanted and what the truth is. On the whole, supposing that no one takes\r\nadvantage of your unprotected position and our common calamity, it is by\r\nyour means, or not at all, that something may be effected. But even if\r\nyour enemies have begun to annoy you, don't flinch: for _you_ will be\r\nattacked by legal process, not by swords. However, I hope that this may\r\nnot occur. I beg you to write me back word on all subjects, and to\r\nbelieve that though I have less spirit and resource than in old times, I\r\nhave quite as much affection and loyalty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 331: Reading _defuit_ for _fuit_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXII (A III, 15)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTHESSALONICA, 17 AUGUST\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of August I received four letters from you: one in which you\r\nurge me in a tone of reproof to be less weak; a second, in which you say\r\nthat Crassus's freedman has told you about my anxiety and leanness; a\r\nthird, in which you describe the proceedings in the senate; a fourth on\r\nthe subject of Varro's assurances to you as to the friendly feelings of\r\nPompey.\r\n\r\nTo the first my answer is this: though I do grieve, yet I keep all my\r\nmental faculties, and it is precisely that which vexes me--I have no\r\nopportunity and no one with whom to employ so sound an intellect. For if\r\nyou cannot find yourself separated from one individual like myself\r\nwithout sorrow, what do you think must be my case, who am deprived both\r\nof you and of everyone else? And if you, while still in possession of\r\nall your rights, miss me, to what an extent do you think those rights\r\nare missed by me? I will not enumerate the things of which I have been\r\ndespoiled, not only because you are not ignorant of them, but also lest\r\nI should reopen my own sorrow. I only assert this, that never did anyone\r\nin an unofficial position possess such great advantages, or fall into\r\nsuch great miseries. Moreover, lapse of time not only does not soften\r\nthis grief, it even enhances it. For other sorrows are softened by age,\r\nthis one cannot but be daily increased both by my sense of present\r\nmisery and the recollection of my past life. For it is not only property\r\nor friends that I miss, but myself. For what am I? But I will not allow\r\nmyself either to wring your soul with my complaints, or to place my\r\nhands too often on my wounds. For as to your defence of those whom I\r\nsaid had been jealous of me, and among them Cato, I indeed think that he\r\nwas so far removed from that crime, that I am above all things sorry\r\nthat the pretended zeal of others had more influence with me than his\r\nhonesty. As for your excuses for the others, they ought to be excused\r\nin my eyes if they are so in yours. But all this is an old story now.\r\nCrassus's freedman, I think, spoke without any real sincerity. In the\r\nsenate you say that the debate was satisfactory. But what about Curio?\r\nHasn't he read that speech? I can't make out how it got into\r\ncirculation! But Axius, in describing the proceedings of the same day,\r\ndoes not speak so highly of Curio.[332] But he may be omitting\r\nsomething; I know you have certainly not written anything except what\r\nactually occurred. Varro's talk gives me some hope of Cæsar, and would\r\nthat Varro himself would throw himself into the cause! Which he\r\ncertainly will do, both of his own accord and under pressure from you.\r\nFor myself, if fortune ever grants me the enjoyment of you all and of my\r\ncountry, I will at least take care that you shall, above all the rest of\r\nmy friends, have cause to be glad: and I will so discharge all the\r\nduties of affection and friendship, which (to confess the truth) have\r\nnot heretofore been conspicuous, that you shall regard me as restored to\r\nyourself as much as to my brother and my children. If I have in any way\r\nsinned in my conduct to you, or rather since I have done so, pardon me.\r\nFor I have sinned more grievously against myself. And I do not write\r\nthis to you because I know you not to feel deeply for my misfortune: but\r\ncertainly if it had been a matter of _obligation_ with you, and had\r\nalways been so, to love me as much as you do and have done, you would\r\nnever have allowed me to lack that judgment with which you are so well\r\nsupplied,[333] nor would you have allowed me to be persuaded that the\r\npassing of the bill for the \"colleges\" was to our advantage.[334] But\r\nyou did nothing but weep over my sorrow, as though you were my second\r\nself. This was indeed a sign of your affection: but what might have been\r\ndone, if I had earned it at your hands--the spending by you of days and\r\nnights in thinking out the course I ought to have pursued--that was\r\nomitted, owing to my own culpable imprudence, not yours. Now if, I don't\r\nsay you only, but if there had been anyone to urge me, when alarmed at\r\nPompey's ungenerous answer,[335] not to adopt that most degrading\r\ncourse--and you are the person that, above all others, could have done\r\nit--I should either have died honourably, or we should have been living\r\nto-day triumphant. In this you must forgive me. For I find much greater\r\nfault with myself, and only call you in question afterwards, as at once\r\nmy second self and the sharer in my error; and, besides, if I am ever\r\nrestored, our mistake will seem still less in my eyes, and to you at\r\nleast I shall be endeared by your own kindness, since there is none on\r\nmy side.[336] There is something in the suggestion you mentioned as\r\nhaving been made in your conversation with Culleo as to a\r\n_privilegium_,[337] but by far the better course is to have the law\r\nrepealed. For if no one vetoes it, what course can be safer? But if\r\nanyone is found to prohibit its passing, he will be equally able to veto\r\na decree of the senate. Nor is there need for the repeal of anything\r\nelse. For the previous law did not touch me: and if, on its publication,\r\nI had chosen to speak in its favour, or to ignore it, as it ought to\r\nhave been ignored, it could not have done me any harm at all.[338] It\r\nwas at this point first that my judgment failed to assist me, nay, even\r\ndid me harm. Blind, blind, I say, was I in laying aside my senator's\r\ntoga, and in entreating the people; it was a fatal step to take before\r\nsome attack had been begun upon me by name.[339] But I am harping on the\r\npast: it is, however, for the purpose of advising you, if any action is\r\nto be taken, not to touch that law, in which there are many provisions\r\nin the interests of the people. But it is foolish for me to be laying\r\ndown rules as to what you are to do and how. I only wish that something\r\nmay be done! And it is on that point that your letter displays much\r\nreserve: I presume, to prevent my being too much agitated by despair.\r\nFor what action do you see possible to be taken, or in what way? Through\r\nthe senate? But you yourself told me that Clodius had fixed upon the\r\ndoorpost of the senate-house a certain clause in the law, \"that it might\r\nneither be put to the house nor mentioned.\"[340] How could\r\nDomitius,[341] therefore, say that he would bring it before the house?\r\nHow came it about also that Clodius held his tongue, when those you\r\nmention in your letter both spoke on the subject and demanded that a\r\nmotion should be brought in? But if you go to the people--can it be\r\ncarried except with the unanimous approval of the tribunes? What about\r\nmy property? What about my house? Will it be possible to have it\r\nrestored? Or, if that cannot, how can I be? Unless you see these\r\ndifficulties on the way to be solved, what is the hope to which you\r\ninvite me? But if, again, there is no hope, what sort of life is there\r\nfor me? So I await at Thessalonica the gazette of the proceedings of the\r\n1st of August, in accordance with which I shall decide whether to take\r\nrefuge on your estate, in order at once to avoid seeing people I don't\r\nwant to see, to see you, according to your letter, and to be nearer at\r\nhand in case of any motion being made (and this I understand is in\r\naccordance with your view and that of my brother Quintus), or to depart\r\nfor Cyzicus. Now, my dear Pomponius, since you imparted to me none of\r\nyour wisdom in time to save me, either because you had made up your mind\r\nthat I had judgment enough of my own, or that you owed me nothing beyond\r\nbeing by my side; and since, betrayed, beguiled, and hurried into a\r\nsnare as I was, I neglected all my defences, abandoned and left Italy,\r\nwhich was everywhere on the _qui vive_ to defend me, and surrendered\r\nmyself and mine into the hands of enemies while you looked on and said\r\nnothing, though, even if you were not my superior in mental power, you\r\nwere at least in less of a fright: now, if you can, raise the fallen,\r\nand in that way assist me! But if every avenue is barred, take care that\r\nI know that also, and cease at length either to scold me or to offer\r\nyour kindly-meant consolations. If I had meant to impeach your good\r\nfaith, I should not have chosen your roof, of all others, to which to\r\ntrust myself: it is my own folly that I blame for having thought that\r\nyour love for me was exactly what I could have wished it to be:[342] for\r\nif that had been so, you would have displayed the same good faith, but\r\ngreater circumspection; at least, you would have held me back when\r\nplunging headlong into ruin, and would not have had to encounter the\r\nlabours which you are now enduring in saving the wrecks of my fortunes.\r\nWherefore do be careful to look into, examine thoroughly, and write\r\nfully everything that occurs, and resolve (as I am sure you do) that I\r\nshall be _some one_, since I cannot now be the man I was and the man I\r\nmight have been; and lastly, believe that in this letter it is not you,\r\nbut myself that I have accused. If there are any people to whom you\r\nthink that letters ought to be delivered in my name, pray compose them\r\nand see them delivered.\r\n\r\n17 August.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 332: Or, as Prof. Tyrrell suggests, \"does not quote Curio to\r\nthat effect.\" I think, however, that Cicero does not use _laudo_ in this\r\nsense except in connexion with _auctorem_, _auctores_, and even then\r\ngenerally with a subsense, at least, of commendation. The speech was\r\ncomposed to be delivered against the elder Curio and Clodius (see p.\r\n155), but was never delivered. Its personal tone made it dangerous now.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 333: Cicero means that Atticus acted with the emotion\r\nspontaneously arising from his affection, but not with the caution which\r\nhe would have shewn in doing a thing which he was under some obligation\r\nto do.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 334: The ancient \"colleges\" or \"clubs\" had been gradually\r\nincreasing, and a decree of the senate in B.C. 64 had declared certain\r\nof them unlawful.

This is in accordance with the view of\r\nCæsar, who approved of the law, but said that old sores ought not to be\r\nripped up--οὐ μὴν καὶ προσήκειν ἐπὶ παρεληλυθόσι τοιοῦτόν τινα νόμον\r\nσυγγράφεσθει (Dio, xxxviii. 17).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: Because it shewed that he considered himself as coming\r\nunder the new law.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 340: Letter LXVIII, p. 154.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 341: L.

In a certain way he means that he loved him too much. He\r\nallowed his spontaneous feelings full vent, without acting with the cool\r\nwisdom which he would have shewn in fulfilling a duty or moral\r\nobligation. It is more fully expressed above. Still, it was a difficult\r\nthing to say, and he doesn't succeed in making it very clear.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIII (A III, 16)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTHESSALONICA, 19 AUGUST\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nMy whole journey is in suspense till I receive letters from you all of\r\nthe 1st of August. For if there turns out to be any hope, I am for\r\nEpirus: if not, I shall make for Cyzicus or some other place. Your\r\nletter is cheerful[343] indeed, but at the same time, the oftener I read\r\nit, the more it weakens the suggested ground for hope, so that it is\r\neasy to see that you are trying to minister at once to consolation and\r\nto truth.

On that day, however,\r\nLivineius, a freedman of Lucius Regulus, came to me by the direction of\r\nRegulus himself.[344] He announced that absolutely no notice whatever\r\nhad been given of a prosecution, but that there had, nevertheless, been\r\nsome talk about the son of C. Clodius.[345] He also brought me a letter\r\nfrom my brother Quintus. But next day came the slaves of Sestius, who\r\nbrought me a letter from you not so positive in regard to this alarm as\r\nthe conversation of Livineius had been. I am rendered very anxious in\r\nthe midst of my own endless distress, and the more so as Appius[346] has\r\nthe trial of the case. As to other circumstances mentioned in the same\r\nletter by you in connexion with my hopes, I understand that things are\r\ngoing less well than other people represent them. I, however, since we\r\nare now not far from the time at which the matter will be decided, will\r\neither go to your house or will still remain somewhere in this\r\nneighbourhood. My brother writes me word that his interests are being\r\nsupported by you more than by anyone else. Why should I urge you to do\r\nwhat you are already doing? or offer you thanks which you do not expect?\r\nI only pray that fortune may give us the opportunity of enjoying our\r\nmutual affection in security. I am always very anxious to get your\r\nletters, in which I beg you not to be afraid of your minuteness boring\r\nme, or your plain speaking giving me pain.\r\n\r\n4 September.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 344: L.

Was that all mere talk, or was the letter from Cæsar\r\nhostile? Is there some ground for hope? You mentioned, too, that Pompey\r\nhad also used the expression \"after the elections.\" Pray, as you can\r\nconceive the severity of the troubles by which I am prostrated, and as\r\nyou must think it natural to your kindness to do so, inform me fully as\r\nto the whole state of my case. For my brother Quintus, dear good fellow,\r\nwho is so much attached to me, fills his letters with hopeful\r\nexpressions, fearing, I suppose, my entirely losing heart. Whereas your\r\nletters vary in tone; for you won't have me either despair or cherish\r\nrash hopes. I beseech you to let me know everything as far as you can\r\ndetect the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVI (A III, 19)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTHESSALONICA, 15 SEPTEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nAs long as my letters from you all continued to be of such a nature as\r\nto keep expectation alive, I was bound to Thessalonica by hope and eager\r\nlonging: afterwards, when all political measures for this year appeared\r\nto me to be over, I yet determined not to go to Asia, both because a\r\ncrowd of people is disagreeable to me, and because, in case any movement\r\nwas set on foot by the new magistrates, I was unwilling to be far off.\r\nAccordingly, I resolved to go to your house in Epirus, not because the\r\nnatural features of the country mattered to me, shunning as I do the\r\nlight of day altogether, but because it will be most grateful to my\r\nfeelings to set out from a harbour of yours to my restoration; and, if\r\nthat restoration is denied me, there is no place where I shall with\r\ngreater ease either support this most wretched existence or (which is\r\nmuch better) rid myself of it. I shall be in a small society: I shall\r\nshake off the crowd. Your letters have never raised me to such a pitch\r\nof hope as those of others; and yet my hopes have always been less warm\r\nthan your letters. Nevertheless, since a beginning has been made in the\r\ncase, of whatever sort and from whatever motive, I will not disappoint\r\nthe sad and touching entreaties of my best and only brother, nor the\r\npromises of Sestius and others, nor the hopes of my most afflicted wife,\r\nnor the entreaties of my most unhappy Tulliola, as well as your own\r\nloyal letter. Epirus will furnish me with a road to restoration or to\r\nthat other alternative mentioned above. I beg and entreat of you, Titus\r\nPomponius, as you see that I have been despoiled by the treachery of men\r\nof all that most adds splendour to life, of all that can most gratify\r\nand delight the soul, as you see that I have been betrayed and cast away\r\nby my own advisers, as you understand that I have been forced to ruin\r\nmyself and my family--help me by your compassion, and support my brother\r\nQuintus, who is still capable of being saved; protect Terentia and my\r\nchildren. For myself, if you think it possible that you may see me at\r\nRome, wait for me; if not, come to see me if you can, and make over to\r\nme just so much of your land as may be covered by my corpse. Finally,\r\nsend slaves to me with letters as soon and as often as possible.\r\n\r\n15 September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVII (A III, 20)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTHESSALONICA, 4 OCTOBER\r\n\r\n_Cicero greets Q. Cæcilius Pomponianus Atticus, son of Quintus._[347]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nThat this is now the case, and that your uncle has done what he ought to\r\nhave done, I approve in the strongest manner possible: I will say I am\r\n\"glad,\" when circumstances shall admit of my using such a word. Ah me!\r\nhow well everything would have been going if my own spirit, my own\r\njudgment, and the good faith of those on whom I relied had not failed\r\nme! But I won't review these circumstances lest I increase my sorrow.\r\nYet I feel sure that it occurs to your mind what a life ours was, how\r\ndelightful, how dignified. To recover this, in the name of fortune,\r\nbestow all your energies, as I know you do, and take care that I keep\r\nthe birthday of my return in your delightful house with you and my\r\nfamily. For this hope and expectation, though now put before me as being\r\nvery strong, I yet wished to wait in your home in Epirus; but my letters\r\nare such as to make me think it better not to be in the same\r\nneighbourhood. What you say in your letter about my town house and about\r\nCurio's speech is exactly true. Under the general act of restoration, if\r\nonly that is accorded me, everything will be included, of which I care\r\nfor nothing more than for my house. But I don't give you any precise\r\ninjunction, I trust myself wholly to your affection and honour. I am\r\nvery glad to hear that you have extricated yourself from every\r\nembarrassment in view of so large an inheritance. As to your promise to\r\nemploy your means in securing my restoration, though I am in all points\r\nassisted by you above all others, yet I quite see what a support that\r\nis, and I fully understand that you are undertaking and can carry on\r\nmany departments of my cause, and do not need to be asked to do so. You\r\ntell me not to suspect that your feelings have been at all affected by\r\nacts of commission or omission on my part towards you--well, I will obey\r\nyou and will get rid of that anxiety; yet I shall owe you all the more\r\nfrom the fact that your kind consideration for me has been on a higher\r\nlevel than mine for you. Please tell me in your letters whatever you\r\nsee, whatever you make out, whatever is being done in my case, and\r\nexhort all your friends to help in promoting my recall. The bill of\r\nSestius[348] does not shew sufficient regard for my dignity or\r\nsufficient caution. For the proposed law ought to mention me by name,\r\nand to contain a carefully expressed clause about my property. Pray see\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThessalonica, 4 October.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 347: Cicero gives Atticus his full name, rather playfully, as\r\nit was a new acquisition. His uncle, Q. Cæcilius, dying this year, left\r\nhim heir to a large fortune, and adopted him in his will (Nep. _Att._\r\n5). He therefore, according to custom, took his uncle's _prænomen_ and\r\n_nomen_, Q. Cæcilius, retaining his own _nomen_ in an adjectival form\r\n(Pomponianus) as a _cognomen_, just as C. Octavius became, by his\r\nuncle's will, _C. Iulius Cæsar Octavianus_.

Don't suppose that I\r\nwrite longer letters to anyone else, unless some one has written at\r\nunusual length to me, whom I think myself bound to answer. For I have\r\nnothing to write about, and there is nothing at such a time as this that\r\nI find it more difficult to do. Moreover, to you and my dear Tulliola I\r\ncannot write without many tears. For I see you reduced to the greatest\r\nmisery--the very people whom I desired to be ever enjoying the most\r\ncomplete happiness, a happiness which it was my bounden duty to secure,\r\nand which I should have secured if I had not been such a coward. Our\r\ndear Piso I love exceedingly for his noble conduct. I have to the best\r\nof my ability encouraged him by letter to proceed, and thanked him, as I\r\nwas bound to do. I gather that you entertain hopes in the new tribunes.\r\nWe shall have reason to depend on that, if we may depend on Pompey's\r\ngoodwill, but yet I am nervous about Crassus. I gather that you have\r\nbehaved in every respect with the greatest courage and most loyal\r\naffection, nor am I surprised at it; but I grieve that the position\r\nshould be such that my miseries are relieved by such heavy ones on your\r\npart. For a kind friend of ours, Publius Valerius, has told me in a\r\nletter which I could not read without violent weeping, how you had been\r\ndragged from the temple of Vesta to the Valerian bank.[349] To think of\r\nit, my dear, my love! You from whom everybody used to look for\r\nhelp![350] That you, my Terentia, should now be thus harassed, thus\r\nprostrate in tears and humiliating distress! And that this should be\r\nbrought about by my fault, who have preserved the rest of the citizens\r\nonly to perish myself! As to what you say about our town house, or\r\nrather its site, I shall not consider myself fully restored, until it\r\nhas also been restored for me. However, these things are not yet within\r\nour grasp. I am only sorry that you, impoverished and plundered as you\r\nare, should be called upon to bear any part of the present expenses. Of\r\ncourse, if the business is successfully accomplished we shall get\r\neverything back: but if the same evil fortune keeps us down, will you be\r\nso foolish as to throw away even the poor remains of your fortune?[351]\r\nI beseech you, my life, as far as expense goes, allow others to bear it,\r\nwho are well able if they are only willing to do so; and do not, as you\r\nlove me, try your delicate constitution. For I have you day and night\r\nbefore my eyes: I see you eagerly undertaking labours of every kind: I\r\nfear you cannot endure them. Yet I see that everything depends on you!\r\nWherefore, to enable us to attain what you hope and are striving for,\r\nattend carefully to your health. _I_ don't know to whom to write except\r\nto those who write to me, or to those about whom you say something in\r\nyour letters. I will not go farther off, since that is your wish, but\r\npray send me a letter as often as possible, especially if there is\r\nanything on which we may safely build our hope. Good-bye, my loves,\r\ngood-bye!\r\n\r\nThessalonica, 5 October.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 349: Terentia, whose half-sister was a Vestal, seems to have\r\ntaken sanctuary with the Vestals, as did the mother and sister of\r\nAugustus in B.C. 43. The special indignity of which Cicero complains is\r\nthat she had been forced to leave the sanctuary and appear at the bank\r\nof Valerius, but for what purpose we cannot now tell. It is suggested\r\nthat it was to make some solemn declaration as to her husband's\r\nproperty, some of which she may be supposed to have tried to conceal.\r\nThe term _ducta esses_ is that applied to prisoners led through the\r\nstreets, but we may regard it as used _ad invidiam_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 350: In securing her husband's advocacy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 351: Mention is made of Terentia's separate estate in Letters\r\nXXX and LXXXI.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIX (A III, 21)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTHESSALONICA, 28 OCTOBER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nIt is exactly thirty days to the writing of this letter since I have\r\nheard from you.

Up to the present,\r\nPlancius[352] keeps me here by his generous treatment, though I have\r\nseveral times already made an effort to go to Epirus. He has conceived a\r\nhope, which I do not share, that we may possibly quit the province\r\ntogether: he hopes that that may redound greatly to his credit. But as\r\nsoon as news shall come that soldiers are on their way hither,[353] I\r\nshall have to insist on quitting him. And as soon as I do that I will\r\nat once send you word, that you may know where I am. Lentulus,[354] in\r\nhis own peculiar zeal for my cause, which he manifests by action and\r\npromises and writings, gives me some hope of Pompey's friendly feelings.\r\nFor you have often told me in your letters that the latter was wholly\r\ndevoted to him. As to Metellus,[355] my brother has written me word that\r\nby your agency as much has been accomplished as he had hoped. My dear\r\nPomponius, fight hard that I may be allowed to live with you and my own\r\nfamily, and write me everything that occurs. I am heavy with sorrow and\r\nregret for all my dear ones, who have always been dearer to me than\r\nmyself.

When\r\nI turn my face from this town towards your house I will let you know,\r\nand for your part I would have you write me everything with the utmost\r\nparticularity, whatever its nature.

I learn, both from the\r\nletters of many and the conversation of all whom I meet, that you are\r\nshewing a virtue and courage surpassing belief; and that you give no\r\nsign of fatigue in mind or body from your labours. Ah me! To think that\r\na woman of your virtue, fidelity, uprightness, and kindness should have\r\nfallen into such troubles on my account! And that my little Tullia\r\nshould reap such a harvest of sorrow from the father, from whom she used\r\nto receive such abundant joys! For why mention my boy Cicero, who from\r\nthe first moment of conscious feeling has been made aware of the\r\nbitterest sorrows and miseries? And if, as you say, I had thought these\r\nthings the work of destiny, I could have borne them somewhat more\r\neasily, but they were really all brought about by my own fault, in\r\nthinking myself beloved by those who were really jealous of me, and in\r\nnot joining those who really wanted me.[356] But if I had followed my\r\nown judgment, and had not allowed the observations of friends, who were\r\neither foolish or treacherous, to have such great influence with me, we\r\nshould have been living at the height of bliss. As it is, since friends\r\nbid us hope, I will do my best to prevent my weakness of health from\r\nfailing to second your efforts. I fully understand the magnitude of the\r\ndifficulty, and how much easier it will turn out to have been to stay at\r\nhome than to get back. However, if we have all the tribunes on our side,\r\nif we find Lentulus as zealous as he appears to be, if, finally, we have\r\nPompey and Cæsar, there is no reason to despair. About our slaves,[357]\r\nwe will do what you say is the opinion of our friends. As to this place,\r\nby this time the epidemic has taken its departure; but while it lasted,\r\nit did not touch me. Plancius, the kindest of men, desires me to stay\r\nwith him and still keeps me from departing. I wanted to be in a less\r\nfrequented district in Epirus, to which neither Hispo[358] nor soldiers\r\nwould come, but as yet Plancius keeps me from going; he hopes that he\r\nmay possibly quit his province for Italy in my company. And if ever I\r\nsee that day, and come once more into your arms, and if I ever recover\r\nyou all and myself, I shall consider that I have reaped a sufficient\r\nharvest both of your piety and my own. Piso's[359] kindness, virtue, and\r\naffection toward us all are so great that nothing can surpass them. I\r\nhope his conduct may be a source of pleasure to him, a source of glory I\r\nsee clearly that it will be. I did not mean to find fault with you about\r\nmy brother Quintus, but I wished that you all, especially considering\r\nhow few there are of you, should be as closely united as possible. Those\r\nwhom you wished me to thank I have thanked, and told them that my\r\ninformation came from you. As to what you say in your letter, my dear\r\nTerentia, about your intention of selling the village, alas! in heaven's\r\nname, what will become of you? And if the same ill-fortune continues to\r\npursue us, what will become of our poor boy? I cannot write the rest--so\r\nviolent is my outburst of weeping, and I will not reduce you to the same\r\ntearful condition. I only add this: if my friends remain loyal to me,\r\nthere will be no lack of money; if not, you will not be able to effect\r\nour object out of your own purse. In the name of our unhappy fortunes,\r\nbeware how we put the finishing stroke to the boy's ruin. If he has\r\nsomething to keep him from absolute want, he will need only moderate\r\ncharacter and moderate luck to attain the rest. See to your health, and\r\nmind you send me letter-carriers, that I may know what is going on and\r\nwhat you are all doing. I have in any case only a short time to wait.\r\nGive my love to Tulliola and Cicero. Good-bye.\r\n\r\nDyrrachium,[360] 27 November.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have come to Dyrrachium both because it is a free state, very\r\nkindly disposed to me, and the nearest point to Italy.[361] But if the\r\ncrowded condition of the place offends me, I shall take myself elsewhere\r\nand I will write you word.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 356: The party of the triumvirs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 357: See Letter LXI, p. 142.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 358: A centurion or other officer in the army of Piso crossing\r\nto Macedonia.

The crowded state of the\r\ntown--by which Cicero means crowded with Romans--would arise from its\r\nbeing the usual place of disembarkation from Rome across the north of\r\nthe Greek peninsula to the East. There was doubtless always a large\r\ntraffic between it and Brundisium, but at this time of year, when\r\nsailing would be, if possible, avoided, he might hope to find it\r\nsomewhat less crowded.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXII (A III, 23)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nDYRRACHIUM, 29 NOVEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of November I received three letters from you, one dated\r\n25th of October, in which you exhort me to await the month of January\r\nwith a good heart, and write at length on such topics as you think tend\r\nto encourage my hopes--as to the zeal of Lentulus, the goodwill of\r\nMetellus, and the general policy of Pompey. In the second letter,\r\ncontrary to your usual custom, you append no date, but give sufficient\r\nindication of the time of its writing. For the law having been published\r\nby the eight tribunes, you mention that you wrote this letter on the\r\nvery same day, that is, the 29th of October,[362] and you say what good\r\nyou think that publication has done. In regard to which, if my\r\nrestoration is to be despaired of along with this law, I would have you\r\nthink in your affection for me that my fruitless exertions are pitiable\r\nrather than foolish: but if there is any ground for hope, try and secure\r\nthat my cause may be hereafter supported with greater attention to\r\ndetails by the new magistrates. For this bill of the old tribunes[363]\r\nhad three clauses, of which the one relating to my return was carelessly\r\ndrafted. For nothing is restored to me except my citizenship and\r\nsenatorial rank: which, in the circumstances of my position, suffices\r\nme, but it does not escape your observation what special provisions will\r\nhave to be made, and in what manner. The second clause is the usual\r\none--\"If anything be done in virtue of this law against other\r\nlaws.\"[364] But observe, my dear Pomponius, what the object of the third\r\nclause is, and by whom it has been put in. For you know that Clodius\r\nprovided that it should be scarcely possible, or rather altogether\r\nimpossible, for his law to be deprived of validity either by senate or\r\npeople. But you must see that the penal provisions of such laws as are\r\nrepealed have never been observed. For in that case hardly any law could\r\nbe repealed at all--for there is no law which does not hedge itself in\r\nby trying to make repeal difficult--but when a law is repealed, so is\r\nthe clause meant to prevent its repeal. Now, though this is in truth the\r\ncase, since it has been the universal doctrine and practice, our eight\r\ntribunes introduced the following clause: _If any provision is contained\r\nin this bill which, in view of existing laws or plebiscites_ (_i.e._,\r\nClodius's law), _it is not lawful without incurring penalty, now or\r\nheretofore, whether to publish, repeal, amend, or supersede, or whereby\r\nhe who has so published or amended would be liable to penalty or\r\nfine--such provision is not enacted by this law_. And observe that this\r\ncontingency did not touch the case of those eight tribunes, for they\r\nwere not bound by a law emanating from their own body.[365] Which makes\r\none the more suspicious of some evil intention, since they have added a\r\nclause which did not affect themselves, but was against my interests: so\r\nthat the new tribunes, if they happened to be somewhat timid, would\r\nthink it still more necessary to employ the clause.[366] And Clodius did\r\nnot fail to notice this. For he said in the public meeting of November\r\nthe third, that by this clause a limit to their legal powers was laid\r\ndown for the tribunes-designate; and yet it cannot escape your notice\r\nthat in no law is there a clause of the sort: whereas, if it had been\r\nnecessary, everybody would have employed it in repealing a law. How this\r\npoint came to escape Ninnius[367] and the rest, pray find out, and who\r\nintroduced the clause, and how it was that the eight tribunes did not\r\nhesitate to bring my case before the senate--which implies that they did\r\nnot think that clause of the law binding--and were yet so cautious in\r\ntheir proposal for its repeal, as to be afraid (though not personally\r\nliable) of what need not be taken into consideration, even by those who\r\nare bound by the law. This clause I would not have the new tribunes\r\npropose; however, let them only carry something, no matter what: I shall\r\nbe content with the single clause recalling me, so long only as the\r\nbusiness is done. I have for some time been feeling ashamed of writing\r\nat such length; for I fear by the time you read this it will be all up\r\nwith any hopes, so that this minute criticism of mine may seem pitiable\r\nto you and ridiculous to others. But if there is any ground for hope,\r\npray look at the law which Visellius[368] drafted for T. Fadius. I like\r\nit very much: for that of our friend Sestius, which you say has your\r\napprobation, I don't like.\r\n\r\nThe third letter is dated 12th of November, in which you explain with\r\nwisdom and care what the circumstances are which seem to cause a\r\npostponement of my affair, and about Crassus, Pompey, and the rest.\r\nAccordingly, I beg you, if there is any hope that the matter can be\r\nsettled by the zeal of the loyalists, by the exertion of influence, and\r\nby getting numbers on our side, to endeavour to break through all\r\ndifficulties at a rush, to throw your whole weight into the attempt, and\r\nincite others to do the same. But if, as I perceive from your\r\nconjectures as well as my own, there is no hope left, I beg and implore\r\nyou to cherish my brother Quintus, whom I to our mutual misery have\r\nruined, and not allow him to do anything to himself which would be to\r\nthe detriment of your sister's son. My little Cicero, to whom, poor boy!\r\nI leave nothing but prejudice and the blot upon my name, pray protect to\r\nthe best of your power. Terentia, that most afflicted of women, sustain\r\nby your kindness. I shall start for Epirus as soon as I have received\r\nnews of the first days of the new tribunate.[369] Pray describe fully to\r\nme in your next letter what sort of a beginning is made.\r\n\r\n29 November.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 362: This bill for Cicero's recall would, of course, be vetoed\r\nby Clodius, and could not therefore be passed, but it would probably\r\ninfluence the action of the new tribunes for B.C. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 363: _I.e._, the tribunes of B.C. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 364: _I.e._, securing indemnity to the proposers if there is a\r\ntechnical breach of existing laws, something like the common\r\nclause--\"all statutes to the contrary notwithstanding.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 365: The Clodian law.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 366: Because they would not be protected as the previous\r\ntribunes were by the fact of the Clodian law (which alone was\r\ncontravened) having emanated from their own _collegium_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 367: L.

I have received three\r\nletters from the hands of Aristocritus, which I almost obliterated with\r\ntears. For I am thoroughly weakened with sorrow, my dear Terentia, and\r\nit is not my own miseries that torture me more than yours--and yours, my\r\nchildren! Moreover, I am more miserable than you in this, that whereas\r\nthe disaster is shared by us both, yet the fault is all my own. It was\r\nmy duty to have avoided the danger by accepting a legation,[370] or to\r\nresist it by careful management and the resources at my command, or to\r\nfall like a brave man. Nothing was more pitiful, more base, or more\r\nunworthy of myself than the line I actually took. Accordingly, it is\r\nwith shame as well as grief that I am overpowered. For I am ashamed of\r\nnot having exhibited courage and care to a most excellent wife and most\r\ndarling children. I have, day and night, before my eyes the mourning\r\ndresses, the tears of you all, and the weakness of your own health,\r\nwhile the hope of recall presented to me is slender indeed. Many are\r\nhostile, nearly all jealous. To expel me had been difficult, to keep me\r\nout is easy. However, as long as you entertain any hope, I will not give\r\nway, lest all should seem lost by my fault. As to your anxiety for my\r\npersonal safety, that is now the easiest thing in the world for me, for\r\neven my enemies desire me to go on living in this utter wretchedness. I\r\nwill, however, do as you bid me. I have thanked the friends you desired\r\nme to thank, and I have delivered the letters to Dexippus, and have\r\nmentioned that you had informed me of their kindness. That our Piso has\r\nshewn surprising zeal and kindness to us I can see for myself, but\r\neverybody also tells me of it. God grant that I may be allowed, along\r\nwith you and our children, to enjoy the actual society of such a\r\nson-in-law! For the present our one remaining hope is in the new\r\ntribunes, and that, too, in the first days of their office; if the\r\nmatter is allowed to get stale, it is all over with us. It is for that\r\nreason that I have sent Aristocritus back to you at once, in order that\r\nyou may be able to write to me on the spot as to the first official\r\nsteps taken, and the progress of the whole business; although I have\r\nalso given Dexippus orders to hurry back here at once, and I have sent a\r\nmessage to my brother to despatch letter-carriers frequently. For the\r\nprofessed object of my being at Dyrrachium at the present juncture is\r\nthat I may hear as speedily as possible what is being done; and I am in\r\nno personal danger, for this town has always been defended by me. When I\r\nam told that enemies are on their way here I shall retire into Epirus.\r\nAs to your coming to me, as you say you will if I wish it--for my part,\r\nknowing that a large part of this burden is supported by you, I should\r\nlike you to remain where you are. If you succeed in your attempt I must\r\ncome to you: but if, on the other hand--but I needn't write the rest.\r\nFrom your first, or at most, your second letter, I shall be able to\r\ndecide what I must do. Only be sure you tell me everything with the\r\ngreatest minuteness, although I ought now to be looking out for some\r\npractical step rather than a letter. Take care of your health, and\r\nassure yourself that nothing is or has ever been dearer to me than you\r\nare. Good-bye, my dear Terentia, whom I seem to see before my eyes, and\r\nso am dissolved in tears. Good-bye!\r\n\r\n29 November.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 370: Either the _libera legatio_ or the acting _legatio_ in\r\nGaul, both of which Cæsar offered him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIV (A III, 24)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nDYRRACHIUM, 10 DECEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 58, ÆT. 48]\r\n\r\nWhen, some time ago, I received letters from you all stating that with\r\nyour consent the vote for the expenses of the consular provinces had\r\nbeen taken, though I was nervous as to the result of the measure, I yet\r\nhoped that you saw some good reason for it beyond what I could see: but\r\nwhen I was informed by word of mouth and by letters that this policy of\r\nyours was strongly censured, I was much disturbed, because the hope\r\nwhich I had cherished, faint as it was, seemed completely destroyed. For\r\nif the tribunes are angry with us, what hope can there be? And, indeed,\r\nthey seem to have reason to be angry, since they, who had undertaken my\r\ncause, have not been consulted on the measure; while by your assenting\r\nto it they have been deprived of all the legitimate influence of their\r\noffice: and that though they profess that it was for my sake that they\r\nwished to have the vote for the outfit of the consuls under their\r\ncontrol, not in order to curtail their freedom of action, but in order\r\nto attach them to my cause:[371] that as things stand now, supposing\r\nthe consuls to choose to take part against me, they can do so without\r\nlet or hindrance, but if they wish to do anything in my favour they are\r\npowerless if the tribunes object. For as to what you say in your letter,\r\nthat, if your party had not consented, they would have obtained their\r\nobject by a popular vote--that would have been impossible against the\r\nwill of the tribunes.[372] So I fear, on the one hand, that I have lost\r\nthe favour of the tribunes; and on the other, even supposing that favour\r\nto remain, that the tie has been lost by which the consuls were to be\r\nattached. Added to this is another disadvantage, the abandonment of the\r\nweighty resolution--as, indeed, it was reported to me--that the senate\r\nshould pass no decree until my case had been decided, and that, too, in\r\nthe case of a measure which was not only not urgent, but even contrary\r\nto custom and unprecedented. For I think there is no precedent for\r\nvoting the provincial outfit of magistrates when still only designate:\r\nso that, since in a matter like this the firm line[373] on which my\r\ncause had been taken up has been infringed, there is now no reason why\r\nany decree should not be passed. It is not surprising that those friends\r\nto whom the question was referred assented, for it was difficult to find\r\nanyone to express an opinion openly against proposals so advantageous to\r\ntwo consuls. It would in any case have been difficult not to be\r\ncomplaisant to such a warm friend as Lentulus, or to Metellus after the\r\nexceedingly kind way in which he put aside his quarrel with me. But I\r\nfear that, while failing to keep a hold on them, we have lost the\r\ntribunes. How this matter has occurred, and in what position the whole\r\nbusiness stands, I would have you write to me, and in the same spirit as\r\nbefore: for your outspoken candour, even if not altogether pleasant, is\r\nyet what I prefer.\r\n\r\n10 December.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 371: The phrase _ornare provincias, ornare consules_, etc.,\r\nmeans the vote in the senate deciding the number of troops, amount of\r\nmoney, and other outfit that the magistrates going to their provinces\r\nwere to have. The provinces to be taken by outgoing consuls were decided\r\nbefore the elections--in this case they were Cilicia and Spain. But the\r\n_ornatio_ usually took place after the consuls had entered on their\r\noffice, _i.e._, after the 1st of January. For this year, however--we\r\ndon't know why--it had taken place before the 1st of December, B.C. 58.\r\nThe result of this would be that the new tribunes for B.C. 57--entering\r\non their office 10th December, B.C. 58--would have no voice in the\r\nmatter, and would thus lose a great hold on the consuls. Most of these\r\ntribunes were supporters of Cicero, while he was doubtful as to one of\r\nthe consuls--Q. Cæcilius Metellus Nepos. He thinks, therefore, that his\r\ncause has lost by this measure, for the tribunes will have less power of\r\nputting force on the consuls to do anything for him, and yet the same\r\npower of stopping them should they wish to do anything of their own\r\naccord. Besides, the new tribunes may be alienated by what they may\r\nthink a measure derogatory to their position. These fears came to\r\nnothing; the tribunes were loyal to Cicero, and the consul Piso\r\nforwarded his recall.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 372: Because the tribunes could have vetoed any measure\r\nbrought before the people, and so could have forced the consuls to come\r\nto terms.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 373: _I.e._, that the senate would pass no decree prior to one\r\nrecalling Cicero.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXV (A III, 25)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (?

But I pass over this, that I may not seem to be ungrateful\r\nand to wish everything to share my own ruin. All I ask of you is what\r\nyou have faithfully promised, that you will appear before the 1st of\r\nJanuary wherever I may be.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: There is no indication in the letter as to where Atticus\r\nis. He left Rome late in B.C. 58, and apparently did not return till\r\nafter Cicero's recall. The most natural explanation is that he was in\r\nEpirus, or somewhere in Greece, and that he had visited Cicero at\r\nDyrrachium on his way. I do not quite see how this should be thought\r\nimpossible in view of the last sentence of LXXXV or the next letter.\r\nCicero asks Atticus to join him, but he might do so whether Atticus were\r\nat Buthrotum, or Rome, or anywhere else.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVI (A III, 26)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 57.

We have\r\n     no letters in the interval between January and August, but a few\r\n     lively ones recounting the nature of his return (4th of September),\r\n     and four speeches dealing with his position and that of his\r\n     property. He seems at once to have attached himself to Pompey, and\r\n     to have promoted his appointment as _præfectus annonæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (? IN EPIRUS[374])\r\n\r\nDYRRACHIUM, JANUARY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 57, ÆT. 49]\r\n\r\nI have received a letter from my brother Quintus inclosing the decree of\r\nthe senate passed concerning me. My intention is to await the time for\r\nlegislation, and, if the law is defeated, I shall avail myself of the\r\nresolution of the senate,[375] and prefer to be deprived of my life\r\nrather than of my country. Make haste, I beg, to come to me.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: On 1st January, B.C. 57, P. Lentulus brought the case of\r\nCicero before the senate. The prevailing opinion was that his\r\n_interdictio_ having been illegal, the senate could quash it. But\r\nPompey, for the sake of security, recommended a _lex_. One of the\r\ntribunes, without actually vetoing the _senatus consultum_, demanded a\r\nnight for consideration. The question was again debated in succeeding\r\nmeetings of the senate, but on the 25th was not decided. Technically an\r\n_auctoritas_ was a decree that had been vetoed by a tribune, and Cicero\r\n(_pro Sest._ § 74) implies that such a veto had been put in, and at any\r\nrate the _noctis postulatio_ was equivalent to a veto.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVII (A III, 27)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (?

But\r\nother similar events happened, and there is no certain means of dating\r\nthis note.

METELLUS THE CONSUL (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nDYRRACHIUM (JANUARY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 57, ÆT. 49]\r\n\r\nA letter from my brother Quintus, and one from my friend Titus\r\nPomponius, had given me so much hope, that I depended on your assistance\r\nno less than on that of your colleague. Accordingly, I at once sent you\r\na letter in which, as my present position required, I offered you thanks\r\nand asked for the continuance of your assistance. Later on, not so much\r\nthe letters of my friends, as the conversation of travellers by this\r\nroute, indicated that your feelings had undergone a change; and that\r\ncircumstance prevented my venturing to trouble you with letters. Now,\r\nhowever, my brother Quintus has sent me a copy which he had made of your\r\nexceedingly kind speech delivered in the senate. Induced by this I have\r\nattempted to write to you, and I do ask and beg of you, as far as I may\r\nwithout giving you offence, to preserve your own friends along with me,\r\nrather than attack me to satisfy the unreasonable vindictiveness of your\r\nconnexions. You have, indeed, conquered yourself so far as to lay aside\r\nyour own enmity for the sake of the Republic: will you be induced to\r\nsupport that of others _against_ the interests of the Republic? But if\r\nyou will in your clemency now give me assistance, I promise you that I\r\nwill be at your service henceforth: but if neither magistrates, nor\r\nsenate, nor people are permitted to aid me, owing to the violence which\r\nhas proved too strong for me, and for the state as well, take care\r\nlest--though you may wish the opportunity back again for retaining all\r\nand sundry in their rights--you find yourself unable to do so, because\r\nthere will be nobody to be retained.[377]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 377: This intentionally enigmatical sentence is meant to\r\ncontain a menace against Clodius, who is hinted at in the word _omnium_,\r\njust as he is earlier in the letter in the word _tuorum_. Clodius was a\r\nconnexion by marriage of Metellus (through his late brother, the husband\r\nof Clodia), and Cicero assumes that Metellus is restrained from helping\r\nhim by regard for Clodius. He knows, however, by this time, that one of\r\nthe new tribunes, Milo, is prepared to repel force by force, and he\r\nhints to Metellus that if he countenances Clodius's violence he may some\r\nday find that there is no Clodius to save--if that's his object. In\r\nLetter LXXXIX he shews how early he had contemplated Clodius being\r\nkilled by Milo (_occisum iri ab ipso Milone video_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIX (A IV, 1)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)\r\n\r\nROME (SEPTEMBER)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 57, ÆT. 49]\r\n\r\nDirectly I arrived at Rome, and there was anyone to whom I could safely\r\nintrust a letter for you, I thought the very first thing I ought to do\r\nwas to congratulate you in your absence on my return. For I knew, to\r\nspeak candidly, that though in giving me advice you had not been more\r\ncourageous or far-seeing than myself, nor--considering my devotion to\r\nyou in the past--too careful in protecting me from disaster, yet that\r\nyou--though sharing in the first instance in my mistake, or rather\r\nmadness, and in my groundless terror--had nevertheless been deeply\r\ngrieved at our separation, and had bestowed immense pains, zeal, care,\r\nand labour in securing my return. Accordingly, I can truly assure you of\r\nthis, that in the midst of supreme joy and the most gratifying\r\ncongratulations, the one thing wanting to fill my cup of happiness to\r\nthe brim is the sight of you, or rather your embrace; and if I ever\r\nforfeit that again, when I have once got possession of it, and if, too,\r\nI do not exact the full delights of your charming society that have\r\nfallen into arrear in the past, I shall certainly consider myself\r\nunworthy of this renewal of my good fortune.\r\n\r\nIn regard to my political position, I have resumed what I thought there\r\nwould be the utmost difficulty in recovering--my brilliant standing at\r\nthe bar, my influence in the senate, and a popularity with the loyalists\r\neven greater than I desired. In regard, however, to my private\r\nproperty--as to which you are well aware to what an extent it has been\r\ncrippled, scattered, and plundered--I am in great difficulties, and\r\nstand in need, not so much of your means (which I look upon as my own),\r\nas of your advice for collecting and restoring to a sound state the\r\nfragments that remain. For the present, though I believe everything\r\nfinds its way to you in the letters of your friends, or even by\r\nmessengers and rumour, yet I will write briefly what I think you would\r\nlike to learn from my letters above all others. On the 4th of August I\r\nstarted from Dyrrachium, the very day on which the law about me was\r\ncarried. I arrived at Brundisium on the 5th of August. There my dear\r\nTulliola met me on what was her own birthday, which happened also to be\r\nthe name-day of the colony of Brundisium and of the temple of Safety,\r\nnear your house. This coincidence was noticed and celebrated with warm\r\ncongratulations by the citizens of Brundisium. On the 8th of August,\r\nwhile still at Brundisium, I learnt by a letter from Quintus that the\r\nlaw had been passed at the _comitia centuriata_ with a surprising\r\nenthusiasm on the part of all ages and ranks, and with an incredible\r\ninflux of voters from Italy. I then commenced my journey, amidst the\r\ncompliments of the men of highest consideration at Brundisium, and was\r\nmet at every point by legates bearing congratulations. My arrival in the\r\nneighbourhood of the city was the signal for every soul of every order\r\nknown to my nomenclator coming out to meet me, except those enemies who\r\ncould not either dissemble or deny the fact of their being such. On my\r\narrival at the Porta Capena, the steps of the temples were already\r\nthronged from top to bottom[378] by the populace; and while their\r\ncongratulations were displayed by the loudest possible applause, a\r\nsimilar throng and similar applause accompanied me right up to the\r\nCapitol, and in the forum and on the Capitol itself there was again a\r\nwonderful crowd. Next day, in the senate, that is, the 5th of September,\r\nI spoke my thanks to the senators. Two days after that--there having\r\nbeen a very heavy rise in the price of corn, and great crowds having\r\nflocked first to the theatre and then to the senate-house, shouting out,\r\nat the instigation of Clodius, that the scarcity of corn was my\r\ndoing--meetings of the senate being held on those days to discuss the\r\ncorn question, and Pompey being called upon to undertake the management\r\nof its supply in the common talk not only of the plebs, but of the\r\naristocrats also, and being himself desirous of the commission, when the\r\npeople at large called upon me by name to support a decree to that\r\neffect, I did so, and gave my vote in a carefully-worded speech. The\r\nother consulars, except Messalla and Afranius, having absented\r\nthemselves on the ground that they could not vote with safety to\r\nthemselves, a decree of the senate was passed in the sense of my motion,\r\nnamely, that Pompey should be appealed to to undertake the business, and\r\nthat a law should be proposed to that effect. This decree of the senate\r\nhaving been publicly read, and the people having, after the senseless\r\nand new-fangled custom that now prevails, applauded the mention of my\r\nname,[379] I delivered a speech. All the magistrates present, except one\r\nprætor and two tribunes, called on me to speak.[380] Next day a full\r\nsenate, including all the consulars, granted everything that Pompey\r\nasked for. Having demanded fifteen legates, he named me first in the\r\nlist, and said that he should regard me in all things as a second self.\r\nThe consuls drew up a law by which complete control over the corn-supply\r\nfor five years throughout the whole world was given to Pompey. A second\r\nlaw is drawn up by Messius,[381] granting him power over all money, and\r\nadding a fleet and army, and an _imperium_ in the provinces superior to\r\nthat of their governors. After that our consular law seems moderate\r\nindeed: that of Messius is quite intolerable. Pompey professes to prefer\r\nthe former; his friends the latter. The consulars led by Favonius\r\nmurmur: I hold my tongue, the more so that the pontifices have as yet\r\ngiven no answer in regard to my house.[382] If they annul the\r\nconsecration I shall have a splendid site. The consuls, in accordance\r\nwith a decree of the senate, will value the cost of the building that\r\nstood upon it; but if the pontifices decide otherwise, they will pull\r\ndown the Clodian building, give out a contract in their own name (for a\r\ntemple), and value to me the cost of a site and house. So our affairs\r\nare\r\n\r\n    \"For happy though but ill, for ill not worst.\"[383]\r\n\r\nIn regard to money matters I am, as you know, much embarrassed. Besides,\r\nthere are certain domestic troubles, which I do not intrust to writing.\r\nMy brother Quintus I love as he deserves for his eminent qualities of\r\nloyalty, virtue, and good faith. I am longing to see you, and beg you to\r\nhasten your return, resolved not to allow me to be without the benefit\r\nof your advice. I am on the threshold, as it were, of a second life.\r\nAlready certain persons who defended me in my absence begin to nurse a\r\nsecret grudge at me now that I am here, and to make no secret of their\r\njealousy. I want you very much.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 378: Reading _ab infimo_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 379: As backing the decree. The phrase was _aderat scribendo\r\nM. Tullius Cicero_, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 380: _Dederunt_, _i.e._, _contionem_; lit. gave me a meeting,\r\n_i.e._, the right of addressing the meeting, which only magistrates or\r\nthose introduced by magistrates could do.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 381: C.

The fact is that, since my return to Rome, this\r\nis only the second time that I have been told of anyone to whom I could\r\ndeliver a letter, and accordingly this is my second letter to you. In my\r\nformer I described the reception I had on my return, what my political\r\nposition was, and how my affairs were.\r\n\r\n    \"For happy though but ill, for ill not worst.\"\r\n\r\nThe despatch of that letter was followed by a great controversy about my\r\nhouse. I delivered a speech before the pontifices on the 29th of\r\nSeptember. I pleaded my cause with care, and if I ever was worth\r\nanything as a speaker, or even if I never was on any other occasion, on\r\nthis one at any rate my indignation at the business, and the importance\r\nof it, did add a certain vigour to my style.[384] Accordingly, the\r\nrising generation must not be left without the benefit of this speech,\r\nwhich I shall send you all the same, even if you don't want it.[385] The\r\ndecree of the pontifices was as follows: \"If neither by order of the\r\npeople nor vote of the plebs the party alleging that he had dedicated\r\nhad been appointed by name to that function, nor by order of the people\r\nor vote of the plebs had been commanded to do so, we are of opinion that\r\nthe part of the site in question may be restored to M. Tullius without\r\nviolence to religion.\" Upon this I was at once congratulated--for no one\r\ndoubted that my house was thereby adjudged to me--when all on a sudden\r\nthat fellow mounts the platform to address a meeting, invited to speak\r\nby Appius,[386] and announces at once to the people that the pontifices\r\nhad decided in his favour,[387] but that I was endeavouring to take\r\nforcible possession; he exhorts them to follow himself and Appius to\r\ndefend their own shrine of Liberty.[388] Hereupon, when even those\r\ncredulous hearers partly wondered and partly laughed at the fellow's mad\r\nfolly, I resolved not to go near the place until such time as the\r\nconsuls by decree of the senate had given out the contract for restoring\r\nthe colonnade of Catulus.[389] On the 1st of October there was a full\r\nmeeting of the senate. All the pontifices who were senators were invited\r\nto attend, and Marcellinus,[390] who is a great admirer of mine, being\r\ncalled on to speak first, asked them what was the purport of their\r\ndecree. Then M. Lucullus, speaking for all his colleagues, answered that\r\nthe pontifices were judges of a question of religion, the senate of the\r\nvalidity of a law: that he and his colleagues had given a decision on a\r\npoint of religion; in the senate they would with the other senators\r\ndecide on the law. Accordingly, each of them, when asked in their proper\r\norder for their opinion, delivered long arguments in my favour. When it\r\ncame to Clodius's turn, he wished to talk out the day, and he went on\r\nendlessly; however, after he had spoken for nearly three hours, he was\r\nforced by the loud expression of the senate's disgust to finish his\r\nspeech at last. On the decree in accordance with the proposal of\r\nMarcellinus passing the senate against a minority of one, Serranus\r\ninterposed his veto.[391] At once both consuls referred the question of\r\nSerranus's veto to the senate. After some very resolute speeches had\r\nbeen delivered--\"that it was the decision of the senate that the house\r\nshould be restored to me\": \"that a contract should be given out for the\r\ncolonnade of Catulus\": \"that the resolution of the house should be\r\nsupported by all the magistrates\": \"that if any violence occurred, the\r\nsenate would consider it to be the fault of the magistrate who vetoed\r\nthe decree of the senate\"--Serranus became thoroughly frightened, and\r\nCornicinus repeated his old farce: throwing off his toga, he flung\r\nhimself at his son-in-law's feet.[392] The former demanded a night for\r\nconsideration. They would not grant it: for they remembered the 1st of\r\nJanuary. It was, however, at last granted with difficulty on my\r\ninterposition. Next day the decree of the senate was passed which I send\r\nyou. Thereupon the consuls gave out a contract for the restoration of\r\nthe colonnade of Catulus: the contractors immediately cleared that\r\nportico of his away to the satisfaction of all.[393] The buildings of my\r\nhouse the consuls, by the advice of their assessors, valued at 2,000,000\r\nsesterces (about £16,000).[394] The rest was valued very stingily. My\r\nTusculan villa at 500,000 sesterces (about £4,000): my villa at Formiæ\r\nat 250,000 sesterces (about £2,000)--an estimate loudly exclaimed\r\nagainst not only by all the best men, but even by the common people. You\r\nwill say, \"What was the reason?\" They for their part say it was my\r\nmodesty--because I would neither say no, nor make any violent\r\nexpostulation. But that is not the real cause: for that indeed in itself\r\nwould have been in my favour.[395] But, my dear Pomponius, those very\r\nsame men, I tell you, of whom you are no more ignorant than myself,\r\nhaving clipped my wings, are unwilling that they should grow again to\r\ntheir old size. But, as I hope, they are already growing again. Only\r\ncome to me! But this, I fear, may be retarded by the visit of your and\r\nmy friend Varro. Having now heard the actual course of public business,\r\nlet me inform you of what I have in my thoughts besides. I have allowed\r\nmyself to be made _legatus_ to Pompey, but only on condition that\r\nnothing should stand in the way of my being entirely free either to\r\nstand, if I choose, for the censorship--if the next consuls hold a\r\ncensorial election--or to assume a \"votive commission\" in connexion\r\nwith nearly any fanes or sacred groves.[396] For this is what falls in\r\nbest with our general policy and my particular occasions. But I wished\r\nthe power to remain in my hands of _either_ standing for election, _or_\r\nat the beginning of the summer of going out of town: and meanwhile I\r\nthought it not disadvantageous to keep myself before the eyes of the\r\ncitizens who had treated me generously. Well, such are my plans in\r\nregard to public affairs; my domestic affairs are very intricate and\r\ndifficult. My town house is being built: you know how much expense and\r\nannoyance the repair of my Formian villa occasions me, which I can\r\nneither bear to relinquish nor to look at. I have advertised my Tusculan\r\nproperty for sale; I don't much care for a suburban residence.[397] The\r\nliberality of friends has been exhausted in a business which brought me\r\nnothing but dishonour: and this you perceived though absent, as did\r\nothers on the spot, by whose zeal and wealth I could easily have\r\nobtained all I wanted, had only my supporters allowed it.[398] In this\r\nrespect I am now in serious difficulty. Other causes of anxiety are\r\nsomewhat more of the _tacenda_ kind.[399] My brother and daughter treat\r\nme with affection. I am looking forward to seeing you.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: The speech _de Domo sua ad Pontifices_. The genuineness\r\nof the existing speech has been doubted. But it may very well be said\r\nthat no one but Cicero could have written it. It is not certainly one of\r\nhis happiest efforts, in spite of what he says here; but he is not\r\nunaccustomed to estimate his speeches somewhat highly, and to mistake\r\nviolence for vigour.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: He will send it to Atticus to get copied by his\r\n_librarii_, and published.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: Appius Claudius Pulcher, brother of P.

Cicero\r\ndevoted the greater part of his speech, therefore, to shewing (1) that\r\nClodius's adoption was invalid, and that he was therefore no tribune,\r\nand incapable of taking an order of the people; (2) that the law was a\r\n_privilegium_, and therefore invalid. The pontifices did not consider\r\neither of these points, which were not properly before them, or within\r\ntheir competence; they merely decided the religious question--that\r\nunless there had been a _iussus populi_ or _plebis scitus_ there was no\r\nvalid consecration.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 388: Or perhaps only \"statue of Liberty,\" as the temple was\r\nnot yet completed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 389: A portico or colonnade, built by Q.

But I do not\r\nunderstand his difficulty, especially as he saw none in the last letter.\r\nCicero (_de Domo_, § 102) certainly implies that Clodius had, at any\r\nrate, partly pulled down the _porticus Catuli_, in order to build\r\nsomething on a larger scale, which was to take in some of Cicero's site.\r\nThis was now to come down, and so leave Cicero his _area_, and, I\r\npresume, the old _porticus Catuli_ was to be restored.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394: Cicero had given Crassus 3,500,000 for it (about\r\n£28,000). See Letter XVI.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395: _I.e._, my modest reserve. There does not seem any reason\r\nfor Tyrrell's emendation of _num_ for _nam_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396: I have translated Klotz's text. That given by Prof.\r\nTyrrell is, to me at any rate, quite unintelligible. Cicero's _legatio_\r\nunder Pompey appears to have been, in fact, honorary, or _libera_, for\r\nhe doesn't seem to have done anything. He wishes to reserve the right of\r\nresigning it to stand for the censorship (censors were elected in the\r\nfollowing year), or of turning it into a _votiva legatio_, to visit\r\ncertain sacred places on the plea of performing a vow, thus getting the\r\nopportunity, if he desired it, of retiring temporarily from Rome in a\r\ndignified manner. The force of _prope_ seems to be \"almost any, I care\r\nnot what.\" It was not likely that a man with his stormy past would do\r\nfor the delicate duties of the censorship, and he would save appearances\r\nby going on a _votiva legatio_. See Letter XLIV.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 397: _Facile careo_, others read _non facile_, \"I don't like\r\nbeing without a suburban residence.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: The thing which brought him \"nothing but dishonour\" was\r\nhis quitting Rome, and the consequent expenses connected with winning\r\nover friends, or paying for Milo's bravoes to face those of Clodius. In\r\nthe last part of the sentence he seems to mean that, had his supporters\r\nbacked him properly, he would have got everything necessary to make good\r\nhis losses from the liberality of the senate. Others explain that\r\n_defensores_ really means Pompey only.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: This and the omission of his wife in the next clause, as\r\nthe similar hint at the end of the last letter, seem to point to some\r\nmisunderstanding with Terentia, with whom, however, a final rupture was\r\npostponed for nearly twelve years (B.C. 46.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCI (A IV, 3)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)\r\n\r\nROME, 24 NOVEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 57, ÆT. 49]\r\n\r\nI am very well aware that you long to know what is going on here, and\r\nalso to know it from me, not because things done before the eyes of the\r\nwhole world are better realized when narrated by my hand than when\r\nreported to you by the pens or lips of others, but because it is from my\r\nletters that you get what you want--a knowledge of _my_ feelings in\r\nregard to the occurrences, and what at such a juncture is the state of\r\nmy mind, or, in a word, the conditions in which I am living. On the 3rd\r\nof November the workmen were driven from the site of my house by armed\r\nruffians: the _porticus Catuli_,[400] which was being rebuilt on a\r\ncontract given out by the consuls, in accordance with a decree of the\r\nsenate, and had nearly reached the roof, was battered down: the house of\r\nmy brother Quintus[401] was first smashed with volleys of stones thrown\r\nfrom my site, and then set on fire by order of Clodius, firebrands\r\nhaving been thrown into it in the sight of the whole town, amidst loud\r\nexclamations of indignation and sorrow, I will not say of the\r\nloyalists--for I rather think there _are_ none--but of simply every\r\nhuman being. That madman runs riot: thinks after this mad prank of\r\nnothing short of murdering his opponents: canvasses the city street by\r\nstreet: makes open offers of freedom to slaves. For the fact is that up\r\nto this time, while trying to avoid prosecution,[402] he had a case,\r\ndifficult indeed to support, and obviously bad, but still a case: he\r\nmight have denied the facts, he might have shifted the blame on others,\r\nhe might even have pleaded that some part of his proceedings had been\r\nlegal. But after such wrecking of buildings, incendiaries, and wholesale\r\nrobberies as these, being abandoned by his supporters, he hardly retains\r\non his side Decimus the marshal,[403] or Gellius; takes slaves into his\r\nconfidence; sees that, even if he openly assassinates everyone he wishes\r\nto, he will not have a worse case before a court of law than he has at\r\npresent. Accordingly, on the 11th of November, as I was going down the\r\nSacred Way, he followed me with his gang. There were shouts,\r\nstone-throwing, brandishing of clubs and swords, and all this without a\r\nmoment's warning. I and my party stepped aside into Tettius Damio's\r\nvestibule: those accompanying me easily prevented his roughs from\r\ngetting in. He might have been killed himself.[404] But I am now on a\r\nsystem of cure by regimen: I am tired of surgery. The fellow, seeing\r\nthat what everybody called for was not his prosecution but his instant\r\nexecution, has since made all your Catilines seem models of\r\nrespectability.[405] For on the 12th of November he tried to storm and\r\nset fire to Milo's house, I mean the one on Germalus:[406] and so openly\r\nwas this done, that at eleven o'clock in the morning he brought men\r\nthere armed with shields and with their swords drawn, and others with\r\nlighted torches. He had himself occupied the house of P. Sulla[407] as\r\nhis headquarters from which to conduct the assault upon Milo's.\r\nThereupon Q. Flaccus led out some gallant fellows from Milo's other\r\nhouse (the _Anniana_): killed the most notorious bravoes of all\r\nClodius's gang: wanted to kill Clodius himself; but my gentleman took\r\nrefuge in the inner part of Sulla's house. The next thing was a meeting\r\nof the senate on the 14th. Clodius stayed at home: Marcellinus[408] was\r\nsplendid: all were keen. Metellus[409] talked the business out by an\r\nobstructive speech, aided by Appius, and also, by Hercules! by your\r\nfriend on whose firmness you wrote me such a wonderfully true letter!\r\nSestius[410] was fuming. Afterwards the fellow vows vengeance on the\r\ncity if his election is stopped. Marcellinus's resolution having been\r\nexposed for public perusal (he had read it from a written copy, and it\r\nembraced our entire case--the prosecution was to include his violent\r\nproceedings on the site of my house, his arson, his assault on me\r\npersonally, and was to take place before the elections), he put up a\r\nnotice that he intended to watch the sky during all comitial days.[411]\r\nPublic speeches of Metellus disorderly, of Appius hot-headed, of\r\nPublius stark mad. The upshot, however, was that, had not Milo served\r\nhis notice of bad omens in the _campus_, the elections would have been\r\nheld. On the 19th of November Milo arrived on the _campus_ before\r\nmidnight with a large company. Clodius, though he had picked gangs of\r\nrunaway slaves, did not venture into the _campus_. Milo stopped there\r\ntill midday,[412] to everybody's great delight and his own infinite\r\ncredit: the movement of the three brethren[413] ended in their own\r\ndisgrace; their violence was crushed, their madness made ridiculous.\r\nHowever, Metellus demands that the obstructive notice should be served\r\non him next day in the forum: \"there was no need to come to the _campus_\r\nbefore daybreak: he would be in the _comitium_ at the first hour of the\r\nday.\"[414] Accordingly, on the 20th Milo came to the forum before\r\nsunrise. Metellus at the first sign of dawn was stealthily hurrying to\r\nthe _campus_, I had almost said by by-lanes: Milo catches our friend up\r\n\"between the groves\"[415] and serves his notice. The latter returned\r\ngreeted with loud and insulting remarks by Q. Flaccus. The 21st was a\r\nmarket day.[416] For two days no public meeting. I am writing this\r\nletter on the 23rd at three o'clock in the morning. Milo is already in\r\npossession of the _campus_. The candidate Marcellus[417] is snoring so\r\nloud that I can hear him next door. I am told that Clodius's vestibule\r\nis completely deserted: there are a few ragged fellows there and a\r\ncanvas lantern.[418] His party complains that I am the adviser of the\r\nwhole business: they little know the courage and wisdom of that hero!\r\nHis gallantry is astonishing. Some recent instances of his superhuman\r\nexcellence I pass over; but the upshot is this: I don't think the\r\nelection will take place. I think Publius will be brought to trial by\r\nMilo--unless he is killed first. If he once puts himself in his way in a\r\nriot, I can see that he will be killed by Milo himself. The latter has\r\nno scruple about doing it; he avows his intention; he isn't at all\r\nafraid of what happened to me, for _he_ will never listen to the advice\r\nof a jealous and faithless friend, nor trust a feeble aristocrat. In\r\nspirit, at any rate, I am as vigorous as in my zenith, or even more so;\r\nin regard to money I am crippled. However, the liberality of my brother\r\nI have, in spite of his protests, repaid (as the state of my finances\r\ncompelled) by the aid of my friends, that I might not be drained quite\r\ndry myself. What line of policy to adopt in regard to my position as a\r\nwhole, I cannot decide in your absence: wherefore make haste to town.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: See last letter.

What happened was this.\r\nMarcellinus's _sententia_ was never put to the vote, because Metellus,\r\nAppius, and Hortensius (Cicero seems to mean him) talked out the\r\nsitting. Accordingly, Marcellinus published it, _i.e._, put it up\r\noutside the Curia to be read: and under it he (or some other magistrate\r\nwhose name has dropped out of the text) put a notice that he was going\r\nto \"watch the sky\" all the _dies comitiales_, so as to prevent the\r\nelection being held. But this had been rendered inoperative by Clodius's\r\namendment of the _lex Ælia Fufia_ (see 2 _Phil._ § 81)--or at any rate\r\nof doubtful validity--and, accordingly, the only thing left was the\r\n_obnuntiatio_ by a magistrate, which Milo proceeded to make. The rule,\r\nhowever was that such _obnuntiatio_ must be made before the _comitia_\r\nwere begun (2 _Phil. ib._), which again could not begin till sunrise.\r\nHence Milo's early visit to the _campus_.

The senate\r\nwas fuller than I had thought possible in the month of December just\r\nbefore the holidays. Of us consulars there were P. Servilius, M.\r\nLucullus, Lepidus, Volcatius, Glabrio: the two consuls-designate; the\r\nprætors. We were a really full house: two hundred in all.[420] Lupus had\r\nexcited some interest.[421] He raised the question of the Campanian land\r\nin considerable detail. He was listened to in profound silence. You are\r\nnot unaware what material that subject affords. He omitted none of the\r\npoints which I had made in this business.[422] There were some sharp\r\nthrusts at Cæsar, some denunciations of Gellius, some appeals to the\r\nabsent Pompey. After concluding his speech at a late hour, he said that\r\nhe would not ask for our votes lest he might burden us with a personal\r\ncontroversy; he quite understood the sentiments of the senate from the\r\ndenunciations of past times and the silence on the present occasion.\r\nMilo spoke. Lupus begins the formula of dismissal,[423] when Marcellinus\r\nsays: \"Don't infer from our silence, Lupus, what we approve or\r\ndisapprove of at this particular time. As far as I am concerned, and I\r\nthink it is the same with the rest, I am only silent because I do not\r\nthink it suitable that the case of the Campanian land should be debated\r\nin Pompey's absence.\" Then Lupus said that he would not detain the\r\nsenate.[423] Racilius rose and began bringing before the house the case\r\nof the proposed prosecutions. He calls upon Marcellinus, of course,\r\nfirst;[424] who, after complaining in serious tones of the Clodian\r\nincendiaries, massacres, and stonings, proposed a resolution that\r\n\"Clodius himself should, under the superintendence of the prætor\r\nurbanus, have his jury allotted to him; that the elections should be\r\nheld only when the allotment of jurors[425] had been completed; that\r\nwhoever stopped the trials would be acting against the interests of the\r\nstate.\"[426] The proposal having been received with warm approval, Gaius\r\nCato[427]--as did also Cassius--spoke against it, with very emphatic\r\nmurmurs of disapprobation on the part of the senate, when he proposed to\r\nhold the elections before the trials. Philippus supported Lentulus.[428]\r\nAfter that Racilius called on me first of the unofficial senators for my\r\nopinion.[429] I made a long speech upon the whole story of P. Clodius's\r\nmad proceedings and murderous violence: I impeached him as though he\r\nwere on his trial, amidst frequent murmurs of approbation from the whole\r\nsenate. My speech was praised at considerable length, and, by Hercules!\r\nwith no little oratorical skill by Antistius Vetus, who also supported\r\nthe priority of the legal proceedings, and declared that he should\r\nconsider it of the first importance. The senators were crossing the\r\nfloor in support of this view,[430] when Clodius, being called on, began\r\ntrying to talk out the sitting. He spoke in furious terms of having been\r\nattacked by Racilius in an unreasonable and discourteous manner. Then\r\nhis roughs on the Græcostasis[431] and the steps of the house suddenly\r\nraised a pretty loud shout, in wrath, I suppose, against Q. Sextilius\r\nand the other friends of Milo. At this sudden alarm we broke up with\r\nloud expressions of indignation on all sides. Here are the transactions\r\nof one day for you: the rest, I think, will be put off to January. Of\r\nall the tribunes I think Racilius is by far the best: Antistius also\r\nseems likely to be friendly to me: Plancius, of course, is wholly ours.\r\nPray, if you love me, be careful and cautious about sailing in December.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 419: Quintus Cicero was in Sardinia as Pompey's _legatus_ as\r\nsuperintendent of the corn-supply, to which office he had been appointed\r\nin August.

DECEMBER)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 57, ÆT. 49]\r\n\r\nHaving been suffering for nine days past from a severe disorder of the\r\nbowels, and being unable to convince those who desired my services that\r\nI was ill because I had no fever, I fled to my Tusculan villa, after\r\nhaving, in fact, observed for two days so strict a fast as not even to\r\ndrink a drop of water. Accordingly, being thoroughly reduced by weakness\r\nand hunger, I was more in want of your services than I thought mine\r\ncould be required by you. For myself, while shrinking from all\r\nillnesses, I especially shrink from that in regard to which the Stoics\r\nattack your friend Epicurus for saying that \"he suffered from strangury\r\nand pains in the bowels\"--the latter of which complaints they attribute\r\nto gluttony, the former to a still graver indulgence. I had been really\r\nmuch afraid of dysentery. But either the change of residence, or the\r\nmere relaxation of anxiety, or perhaps the natural abatement of the\r\ncomplaint from lapse of time, seems to me to have done me good. However,\r\nto prevent your wondering how this came about, or in what manner I let\r\nmyself in for it, I must tell you that the sumptuary law, supposed to\r\nhave introduced plain living, was the origin of my misfortune. For\r\nwhilst your epicures wish to bring into fashion the products of the\r\nearth, which are not forbidden by the law, they flavour mushrooms,\r\n_petits choux_, and every kind of pot-herb so as to make them the most\r\ntempting dishes possible.[433] Having fallen a victim to these in the\r\naugural banquet at the house of Lentulus, I was seized with a violent\r\ndiarrhœa, which, I think, has been checked to-day for the first time.\r\nAnd so I, who abstain from oysters and lampreys without any difficulty,\r\nhave been beguiled by beet and mallows. Henceforth, therefore, I shall\r\nbe more cautious. Yet, having heard of it from Anicius[434]--for he saw\r\nme turning sick--you had every reason not only for sending to inquire,\r\nbut even for coming to see me. I am thinking of remaining here till I am\r\nthoroughly restored, for I have lost both strength and flesh. However,\r\nif I can once get completely rid of my complaint, I shall, I hope,\r\neasily recover these.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 432: The year of this letter has been inferred from the\r\nmention of Lentulus's augural banquet. For P. Cornelius Lentulus\r\nSpinther, son of the consul of B.C. 57, was in this year elected into\r\nthe college of augurs. Yet as we know that Cicero's Tusculan villa was\r\ndismantled by Clodius, and was advertised for sale (though not sold), it\r\nseems rather extraordinary that Cicero should have gone there for his\r\nhealth. The _Fadii Galli_ were a family of Cicero's native place,\r\nArpinum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 433: There were several sumptuary laws. Those which may\r\npossibly be referred to here are (1) the _lex Licinia_ (? B.C. 103),\r\nwhich defined certain foods as illegal at banquets, but excepted _quod\r\nex terra vite arbore ve sit natum_ (Macrobius, _Sat._ iii. 17, 9; Gell.\r\nii. 24, 7); (2) the _lex Æmilia_ (B.C. 68), which also defined both the\r\nquantity and quality of food allowable at banquets (Gell. ii. 24, 12).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 434: C. Anicius, a senator and intimate friend of Cicero's.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIV (F I, I)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56. Coss., Cn. Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus, L.\r\nMarcius Philippus.]\r\n\r\n     In the year B.C. 56 the growing differences between the triumvirs\r\n     were temporarily composed at the meeting at Luca, and Cicero made\r\n     up his mind that the only course for him to pursue was to attach\r\n     himself to them, as the party of the _boni_ had not, as he hoped,\r\n     taken advantage of those differences to attach Pompey to themselves\r\n     as a leader against Cæsar. His recantation is indicated in the\r\n     speeches _de Provinciis Consularibus_ and _pro Balbo_, in which he\r\n     practically supports part, at least, of the arrangements of Luca.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO P. LENTULUS SPINTHER[435] (IN CILICIA)\r\n\r\nROME, 13 JANUARY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nWhatever attention or affection I may shew you, though it may seem\r\nsufficient in the eyes of others, can never seem sufficient in my own.\r\nFor such has been the magnitude of your services to me that, inasmuch as\r\nyou never rested till my affair was brought to a conclusion, while I\r\ncannot effect the same in your cause,[436] I regard my life as a burden.\r\nThe difficulties are these. The king's agent, Hammonius, is openly\r\nattacking us by bribery. The business is being carried out by means of\r\nthe same money-lenders as it was when you were in town. Such people as\r\nwish it done for the king's sake--and they are few--are all for\r\nintrusting the business to Pompey. The senate supports the trumped-up\r\nreligious scruple, not from any respect to religion, but from\r\nill-feeling towards him, and disgust at the king's outrageous bribery. I\r\nnever cease advising and instigating Pompey--even frankly finding fault\r\nwith and admonishing him--to avoid what would be a most discreditable\r\nimputation.[437] But he really leaves no room for either entreaties or\r\nadmonitions from me. For, whether in everyday conversation or in the\r\nsenate, no one could support your cause with greater eloquence,\r\nseriousness, zeal, and energy than he has done, testifying in the\r\nhighest terms to your services to himself and his affection for you.\r\nMarcellinus, you know, is incensed with his flute-playing majesty.[438]\r\nIn everything, saving and excepting this case of the king, he professes\r\nthe intention of being your champion. We take what he gives: nothing can\r\nmove him from his motion as to the religious difficulty, which he made\r\nup his mind to bring, and has, in fact, brought several times before the\r\nsenate. The debate up to the Ides (for I am writing early in the morning\r\nof the Ides[439]) has been as follows: Hortensius and I and Lucullus\r\nvoted for yielding to the religious scruple as far as concerned the\r\narmy,[440] for otherwise there was no possibility of getting the matter\r\nthrough, but, in accordance with the decree already passed on your own\r\nmotion, were for directing you to restore the king, \"so far as you may\r\ndo so without detriment to the state\": so that while the religious\r\ndifficulty prohibits the employment of an army, the senate might still\r\nretain you as the person authorized. Crassus votes for sending three\r\nlegates, not excluding Pompey: for he would allow them to be selected\r\neven from such as are at present in possession of _imperium_.[441]\r\nBibulus is for three legates selected from men without _imperium_. The\r\nother consulars agree with the latter, except Servilius, who says that\r\nhe ought not to be restored at all: and Volcatius, who on the motion of\r\nLupus votes for giving the business to Pompey: and Afranius, who agrees\r\nwith Volcatius. This last fact increases the suspicion as to Pompey's\r\nwishes: for it was noticed that Pompey's intimates agreed with\r\nVolcatius. We are in a very great difficulty: the day seems going\r\nagainst us. The notorious colloguing and eagerness of Libo and Hypsæus,\r\nand the earnestness displayed by Pompey's intimates, have produced an\r\nimpression that Pompey desires it; and those who don't want him to have\r\nit are at the same time annoyed with your having put power into his\r\nhands.[442] I have the less influence in the case because I am under an\r\nobligation to you. Moreover, whatever influence I might have had is\r\nextinguished by the idea people entertain as to Pompey's wishes, for\r\nthey think they are gratifying him. We are in much the same position as\r\nwe were long before your departure: now, as then, the sore has been\r\nfomented secretly by the king himself and by the friends and intimates\r\nof Pompey, and then openly irritated by the consulars, till the popular\r\nprejudice has been excited to the highest pitch. All the world shall\r\nrecognize my loyalty, and your friends on the spot shall see my\r\naffection for you though you are absent. If there were any good faith in\r\nthose most bound to shew it, we should be in no difficulty at all.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 435: Consul of B.C. 57, who had gone at the end of his\r\nconsulship to be governor of Cilicia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 436: When Ptolemy Auletes first appealed to the senate (B.C.\r\n57) to restore him to the throne of Egypt, it appears that a resolution\r\nwas passed authorizing the proconsul of Cilicia to do so; but as Pompey\r\nwished to have the business, the senate found itself in a difficulty,\r\nnot wishing to put him in military command, or daring to offend him by\r\nan open refusal (Dio, xxxix. 12). The tribune C. Cato found up a\r\nSibylline oracle forbidding the employment of an army for the purpose,\r\nwhich served the senate as a decent excuse. The commission to Lentulus\r\nwas eventually withdrawn by an _auctoritas senatus_, and Lentulus did\r\nnot venture to do it. Ptolemy, finding that he could not succeed in\r\ngetting Pompey commissioned, retired to Ephesus, and afterwards\r\nsucceeded by an enormous bribe in inducing Gabinius, the proconsul of\r\nSyria, to do it (B.C. 55).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 437: Of having been induced by greed or ambition to undertake\r\nthe restoration of Ptolemy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 438: Reading _tibicini_ for the unmeaning _tibi_.

LENTULUS SPINTHER (IN CILICIA)\r\n\r\nROME, 15 JANUARY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nNothing was done on the 13th of January in the senate, because the day\r\nwas to a great extent spent in an altercation between the consul\r\nLentulus and the tribune Caninius. On that day I also spoke at\r\nconsiderable length, and thought that I made a very great impression on\r\nthe senate by dwelling on your affection for the house. Accordingly,\r\nnext day we resolved that we would deliver our opinions briefly: for it\r\nappeared to us that the feelings of the senate had been softened towards\r\nus--the result not only of my speech, but of my personal appeal and\r\napplication to individual senators. Accordingly, the first proposition,\r\nthat of Bibulus, having been delivered, that three legates should\r\nrestore the king: the second, that of Hortensius, that you should\r\nrestore him without an army: the third, that of Volcatius, that Pompey\r\nshould do it, a demand was made that the proposal of Bibulus should be\r\ntaken in two parts.[443] As far as he dealt with the religious\r\ndifficulty--a point which was now past being opposed--his motion was\r\ncarried; his proposition as to three legates was defeated by a large\r\nmajority. The next was the proposition of Hortensius. Thereupon the\r\ntribune Lupus, on the ground that he had himself made a proposal about\r\nPompey, starts the contention that he ought to divide the house before\r\nthe consuls. His speech was received on all sides by loud cries of \"No\":\r\nfor it was both unfair and unprecedented. The consuls would not give in,\r\nand yet did not oppose with any vigour. Their object was to waste the\r\nday, and in that they succeeded:[444] for they saw very well that many\r\ntimes the number would vote for the proposal of Hortensius, although\r\nthey openly professed their agreement with Volcatius. Large numbers were\r\ncalled upon for their opinion, and that, too, with the assent of the\r\nconsuls: for they wanted the proposal of Bibulus carried. This dispute\r\nwas protracted till nightfall, and the senate was dismissed. I happened\r\nto be dining with Pompey on that day, and I seized the opportunity--the\r\nbest I have ever had, for since your departure I have never occupied a\r\nmore honourable position in the senate than I had on that day--of\r\ntalking to him in such a way, that I think I induced him to give up\r\nevery other idea and resolve to support your claims. And, indeed, when I\r\nactually hear him talk, I acquit him entirely of all suspicion of\r\npersonal ambition: but when I regard his intimates of every rank, I\r\nperceive, what is no secret to anybody, that this whole business has\r\nbeen long ago corruptly manipulated by a certain coterie, not without\r\nthe king's own consent and that of his advisers.\r\n\r\nI write this on the 15th of January, before daybreak. To-day there is to\r\nbe a meeting of the senate. We shall maintain, as I hope, our position\r\nin the senate as far as it is possible to do so in such an age of\r\nperfidy and unfair dealing. As to an appeal to the people on the\r\nsubject, we have, I think, secured that no proposition can be brought\r\nbefore them without neglect of the auspices or breach of the laws, or,\r\nin fine, without downright violence.[445] The day before my writing\r\nthese words a resolution of the senate on these matters of the most\r\nserious character was passed, and though Cato and Caninius vetoed it, it\r\nwas nevertheless written out.[446] I suppose it has been sent to you. On\r\nall other matters I will write and tell you what has been done, whatever\r\nit is, and I will see that everything is carried out with the most\r\nscrupulous fairness as far as my caution, labour, attention to details,\r\nand influence can secure it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 443: The proposal of Bibulus to send \"three legates\" implied a\r\nconcession to the Sibylline verse, in not sending \"an army.\" It was\r\ntherefore to be voted on as two questions--(1) Shall the Sibylline verse\r\nbe obeyed, and an army not sent? (2) Shall three legates be sent?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 444: That is, the debate went off on the side issue as to who\r\nhad the prior right of dividing the house. Lupus said _he_ had, because\r\nthe proposal of Volcatius was really made before the others, _i.e._, in\r\nthe previous day's debate (see last letter). The consuls were only too\r\nglad thus to avoid having the main question brought to a vote, and let\r\nthis technical point be spun out in a languid debate.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 445: Because they had magistrates ready to stop the _comitia_\r\nby declaring bad omens, and tribunes ready to veto any proposal.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 446: A _senatus consultum_ vetoed by a tribune was written\r\nout, with the names of its proposers and backers, and a statement at the\r\nend as to the tribunes vetoing it. It was thus on record as an\r\n_auctoritas senatus_, \"resolution of the senate,\" not a _senatus\r\nconsultum_. A perfect specimen is given in Letter CCXXIII. This\r\n_auctoritas_ was to the effect that no one was to undertake the\r\nrestoration. See Letter CXIII.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVI (F I, 3)\r\n\r\nTO P. LENTULUS SPINTHER (IN CILICIA)\r\n\r\nROME (?

LENTULUS SPINTHER (IN CILICIA)\r\n\r\nROME, JANUARY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nThough in the senate of the 15th of January we made a most glorious\r\nstand, seeing that on the previous day we had defeated the proposal of\r\nBibulus about the three legates, and the only contest left was with the\r\nproposal of Volcatius, yet the business was spun out by our opponents by\r\nvarious obstructive tactics. For we were carrying our view in a full\r\nsenate, in spite of the multifarious devices and inveterate jealousy of\r\nthose who were for transferring the cause of the king from you to some\r\none else. That day we found Curio very bitterly opposed, Bibulus much\r\nmore fair, almost friendly even. Caninius and Cato declared that they\r\nwould not propose any law before the elections. By the _lex Pupia_, as\r\nyou know, no senate could be held before the 1st of February, nor in\r\nfact during the whole of February,[448] unless the business of the\r\nlegations were finished or adjourned. However, the Roman people are\r\ngenerally of opinion that the pretext of a trumped-up religious scruple\r\nhas been introduced by your jealous detractors, not so much to hinder\r\nyou, as to prevent anyone from wishing to go to Alexandria with a view\r\nof getting the command of an army. However, everyone thinks that the\r\nsenate has had a regard for your position. For there is no one that is\r\nignorant of the fact that it was all the doing of your opponents that no\r\ndivision took place: and if they, under the pretext of a regard for the\r\npeople, but really from the most unprincipled villainy, attempt to carry\r\nanything, I have taken very good care that they shall not be able to do\r\nso without violating the auspices or the laws, or, in fact, without\r\nabsolute violence. I don't think I need write a word either about my own\r\nzeal or the injurious proceedings of certain persons. For why should I\r\nmake any display myself--since, if I were even to shed my blood in\r\ndefence of your position, I should think that I had not covered a tithe\r\nof your services to me? Or why complain of the injurious conduct of\r\nothers, which I cannot do without the deepest pain? I cannot at all\r\npledge myself to you as to the effect of open violence, especially with\r\nsuch feeble magistrates; but, open violence out of the question, I can\r\nassure you that you will retain your high position, if the warmest\r\naffections both of the senate and the Roman people can secure it to you.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 448: _I.e._, no meeting of the senate for ordinary business.\r\nDuring the month of February the senate usually devoted all its time to\r\nhearing and answering deputations from the provinces or foreign states.\r\nThe _lex Pupia_ forbade the meeting of the senate on _dies comitiales_,\r\nand after the 14th the days in January were all _comitiales_: but\r\nanother law (_lex Vatinia_) ordered it to meet every day in February for\r\nthe business of the legations. If this business was concluded or\r\ndeferred it remained a moot point whether a magistrate was not still\r\nbound or, at least, allowed to summon it for other business (_ad Q. Fr._\r\nii. 13).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVII (F I, 5)\r\n\r\nTO P. LENTULUS SPINTHER (IN CILICIA)\r\n\r\nROME, FEBRUARY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nThough the first wish of my heart is that my warmest gratitude to you\r\nshould be recognized first of all by yourself and then by everybody\r\nelse, yet I am deeply grieved that such a state of things has followed\r\nyour departure as to give you occasion, in your absence, to test the\r\nloyalty and good disposition towards you both of myself and others. That\r\nyou see and feel that men are shewing the same loyalty in maintaining\r\nyour position as I experienced in the matter of my restoration, I have\r\nunderstood from your letter. Just when I was depending most securely on\r\nmy policy, zeal, activity and influence in the matter of the king, there\r\nwas suddenly sprung on us the abominable bill of Cato's,[449] to hamper\r\nall our zeal and withdraw our thoughts from a lesser anxiety to a most\r\nserious alarm. However, in a political upset of that kind, though there\r\nis nothing that is not a source of terror yet the thing to be chiefly\r\nfeared is treachery: and Cato, at any rate, whatever happens, we have no\r\nhesitation in opposing. As to the business of Alexandria and the cause\r\nof the king, I can only promise you thus much, that I will to the utmost\r\nof my power satisfy both you, who are absent, and your friends who are\r\nhere. But I fear the king's cause may either be snatched from our hands\r\nor abandoned altogether, and I cannot easily make up my mind which of\r\nthe two alternatives I would least wish. But if the worst comes to the\r\nworst, there is a third alternative, which is not wholly displeasing\r\neither to Selicius[450] or myself--namely, that we should not let the\r\nmatter drop, and yet should not allow the appointment, in spite of our\r\nprotests, to be transferred to the man to whom it is now regarded as\r\npractically transferred.[451] We will take the utmost care not to omit\r\nstruggling for any point that it seems possible to maintain, and not to\r\npresent the appearance of defeat if we have in any case failed to\r\nmaintain it. You must shew your wisdom and greatness of mind by\r\nregarding your fame and high position as resting on your virtue, your\r\npublic services, and the dignity of your character, and by believing\r\nthat, if the perfidy of certain individuals has deprived you of any of\r\nthose honours which fortune has lavished on you, it will be more\r\ninjurious to them than to you. I never let any opportunity slip either\r\nof acting or thinking for your interests. I avail myself of the aid of\r\nQ. Selicius in everything: nor do I think that there is any one of all\r\nyour friends either shrewder, or more faithful, or more attached to you.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 449: That of the tribune C. Cato for the recall of Lentulus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 450: A money-lender, and friend of Lentulus Spinther.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 451: Pompey.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIX (Q FR II, 2)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN SARDINIA)\r\n\r\nROME, 18 JANUARY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nIt was not from the multiplicity of business, though I am very much\r\nengaged, but from a slight inflammation of the eyes that I was induced\r\nto dictate this letter, and not, as is my usual habit, write it with my\r\nown hand. And, to begin with, I wish to excuse myself to you on the very\r\npoint on which I accuse you. For no one up to now has asked me \"whether\r\nI have any commands for Sardinia\"--I think you often have people who\r\nsay, \"Have you any commands for Rome?\" As to what you have said in your\r\nletters to me about the debt of Lentulus and Sestius, I have spoken with\r\nCincius.[452] However the matter stands, it is not the easiest in the\r\nworld. But surely Sardinia must have some special property for recalling\r\none's memory of the past. For just as the famous Gracchus--as\r\naugur--after arriving in that province remembered something that had\r\nhappened to him, when holding the elections in the Campus Martius, in\r\nviolation of the auspices, so you appear to me to have recalled at your\r\nease in Sardinia the design of Numisius and the debts due to Pomponius.\r\nAs yet I have made no purchase. Culleo's auction has taken place: there\r\nwas no purchaser for his Tusculan property. If very favourable terms\r\nwere to be offered, I should perhaps not let it slip. About your\r\nbuilding I do not fail to press Cyrus.[453] I hope he will do his duty.\r\nBut everything goes on somewhat slowly, owing to the prospect of that\r\nmadman's ædileship.[454] For it seems that the legislative assembly will\r\ntake place without delay: it has been fixed for the 20th of January.\r\nHowever, I would not have you uneasy. Every precaution shall be taken by\r\nme. In regard to the Alexandrine king, a decree of the senate was passed\r\ndeclaring it dangerous to the Republic that he should be restored \"with\r\na host.\" The point remaining to be decided in the senate being whether\r\nLentulus or Pompey should restore him, Lentulus seemed on the point of\r\ncarrying the day. In that matter I did justice to my obligations to\r\nLentulus marvellously well, while at the same time splendidly gratifying\r\nPompey's wishes: but the detractors of Lentulus contrived to talk the\r\nmatter out by obstructive speeches. Then followed the comitial days, on\r\nwhich a meeting of the senate was impossible. What the villainy of the\r\ntribunes is going to accomplish I cannot guess; I suspect, however, that\r\nCaninius will carry his bill by violence.[455] In this business I cannot\r\nmake out what Pompey really wishes. What his _entourage_ desire\r\neverybody sees. Those who are financing the king are openly advancing\r\nsums of money against Lentulus. There seems no doubt that the commission\r\nhas been taken out of Lentulus's hands, to my very great regret,\r\nalthough he has done many things for which I might, if it were not for\r\nsuperior considerations, be justly angry with him. I hope, if it is\r\nconsistent with your interests, that you will embark as soon as\r\npossible, when the weather is fair and settled, and come to me. For\r\nthere are countless things, in regard to which I miss you daily in every\r\npossible way. Your family and my own are well.\r\n\r\n18 January.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 452: Agent or steward of Atticus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 453: The architect.

For he told me that you were in Italy and that he was\r\nsending slaves to you. I did not like them to go without a letter from\r\nme; not that I had anything to say to you, especially as you are all but\r\nhere, but that I might express merely this one thing--that your arrival\r\nis most delightful and most ardently wished for by me. Wherefore fly to\r\nus with the full assurance that your affection for me is fully\r\nreciprocated. The rest shall be reserved for our meeting. I write in\r\ngreat haste. The day you arrive, mind, you and your party are to dine\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCI (Q FR II, 3)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN SARDINIA)\r\n\r\nROME, 12 FEBRUARY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nI have already told you the earlier proceedings; now let me describe\r\nwhat was done afterwards. The legations were postponed from the 1st of\r\nFebruary to the 13th. On the former day our business was not brought to\r\na settlement. On the 2nd of February Milo appeared for trial. Pompey\r\ncame to support him. Marcellus spoke on being called upon by me.[456] We\r\ncame off with flying colours. The case was adjourned to the 7th.\r\nMeanwhile (in the senate), the legations having been postponed to the\r\n13th, the business of allotting the quæstors and furnishing the outfit\r\nof the prætors was brought before the house. But nothing was done,\r\nbecause many speeches were interposed denouncing the state of the\r\nRepublic. Gaius Cato published his bill for the recall of Lentulus,\r\nwhose son thereupon put on mourning. On the 7th Milo appeared. Pompey\r\nspoke, or rather wished to speak. For as soon as he got up Clodius's\r\nruffians raised a shout, and throughout his whole speech he was\r\ninterrupted, not only by hostile cries, but by personal abuse and\r\ninsulting remarks. However, when he had finished his speech--for he\r\nshewed great courage in these circumstances, he was not cowed, he said\r\nall he had to say, and at times had by his commanding presence even\r\nsecured silence for his words--well, when he had finished, up got\r\nClodius. Our party received him with such a shout--for they had\r\ndetermined to pay him out--that he lost all presence of mind, power of\r\nspeech, or control over his countenance. This went on up to two\r\no'clock--Pompey having finished his speech at noon--and every kind of\r\nabuse, and finally epigrams of the most outspoken indecency were uttered\r\nagainst Clodius and Clodia. Mad and livid with rage Clodius, in the very\r\nmidst of the shouting, kept putting the questions to his claque: \"Who\r\nwas it who was starving the commons to death?\" His ruffians answered,\r\n\"Pompey.\" \"Who wanted to be sent to Alexandria?\" They answered,\r\n\"Pompey.\" \"Who did they wish to go?\" They answered, \"Crassus.\" The\r\nlatter was present at the time with no friendly feelings to Milo. About\r\nthree o'clock, as though at a given signal, the Clodians began spitting\r\nat our men. There was an outburst of rage. They began a movement for\r\nforcing us from our ground. Our men charged: his ruffians turned tail.\r\nClodius was pushed off the rostra: and then we too made our escape for\r\nfear of mischief in the riot. The senate was summoned into the Curia:\r\nPompey went home. However, I did not myself enter the senate-house, lest\r\nI should be obliged either to refrain from speaking on matters of such\r\ngravity, or in defending Pompey (for he was being attacked by Bibulus,\r\nCurio, Favonius, and Servilius the younger) should give offence to the\r\nloyalists. The business was adjourned to the next day. Clodius fixed the\r\nQuirinalia (17 of February) for his prosecution. On the 8th the senate\r\nmet in the temple of Apollo, that Pompey might attend. Pompey made an\r\nimpressive speech. That day nothing was concluded. On the 9th in the\r\ntemple of Apollo a decree passed the senate \"that what had taken place\r\non the 7th of February was treasonable.\" On this day Cato warmly\r\ninveighed against Pompey, and throughout his speech arraigned him as\r\nthough he were at the bar. He said a great deal about me, to my disgust,\r\nthough it was in very laudatory terms. When he attacked Pompey's perfidy\r\nto me, he was listened to in profound silence on the part of my enemies.\r\nPompey answered him boldly with a palpable allusion to Crassus, and said\r\noutright that \"he would take better precautions to protect his life\r\nthan Africanus had done, whom C. Carbo had assassinated.\"[457]\r\nAccordingly, important events appear to me to be in the wind. For Pompey\r\nunderstands what is going on, and imparts to me that plots are being\r\nformed against his life, that Gaius Cato is being supported by Crassus,\r\nthat money is being supplied to Clodius, that both are backed by Crassus\r\nand Curio, as well as by Bibulus and his other detractors: that he must\r\ntake extraordinary precautions to prevent being overpowered by that\r\ndemagogue--with a people all but wholly alienated, a nobility hostile, a\r\nsenate ill-affected, and the younger men corrupt. So he is making his\r\npreparations and summoning men from the country. On his part, Clodius is\r\nrallying his gangs: a body of men is being got together for the\r\nQuirinalia. For that occasion we are considerably in a majority, owing\r\nto the forces brought up by Pompey himself: and a large contingent is\r\nexpected from Picenum and Gallia, to enable us to throw out Cato's bills\r\nalso about Milo and Lentulus.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of February an indictment was lodged against Sestius for\r\nbribery by the informer Cn. Nerius, of the Pupinian tribe, and on the\r\nsame day by a certain M. Tullius for riot.[458] He was ill. I went at\r\nonce, as I was bound to do, to his house, and put myself wholly at his\r\nservice: and that was more than people expected, who thought that I had\r\ngood cause for being angry with him. The result is that my extreme\r\nkindness and grateful disposition are made manifest both to Sestius\r\nhimself and to all the world, and I shall be as good as my word. But\r\nthis same informer Nerius also named Cn. Lentulus Vatia and C. Cornelius\r\nto the commissioners.[459] On the same day a decree passed the senate\r\n\"that political clubs and associations should be broken up, and that a\r\nlaw in regard to them should be brought in, enacting that those who did\r\nnot break off from them should be liable to the same penalty as those\r\nconvicted of riot.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of February I spoke in defence of Bestia[460] on a charge of\r\nbribery before the prætor Cn. Domitius,[461] in the middle of the forum\r\nand in a very crowded court; and in the course of my speech I came to\r\nthe incident of Sestius, after receiving many wounds in the temple of\r\nCastor, having been preserved by the aid of Bestia. Here I took occasion\r\nto pave the way beforehand for a refutation of the charges which are\r\nbeing got up against Sestius, and I passed a well-deserved encomium upon\r\nhim with the cordial approval of everybody. He was himself very much\r\ndelighted with it. I tell you this because you have often advised me in\r\nyour letters to retain the friendship of Sestius. I am writing this on\r\nthe 12th of February before daybreak: the day on which I am to dine with\r\nPomponius on the occasion of his wedding.\r\n\r\nOur position in other respects is such as you used to cheer my\r\ndespondency by telling me it would be--one of great dignity and\r\npopularity: this is a return to old times for you and me effected, my\r\nbrother, by your patience, high character, loyalty, and, I may also add,\r\nyour conciliatory manners. The house of Licinius, near the grove of\r\nPiso,[462] has been taken for you. But, as I hope, in a few months'\r\ntime, after the 1st of July, you will move into your own. Some excellent\r\ntenants, the Lamiæ, have taken your house in Carinæ.[463] I have\r\nreceived no letter from you since the one dated Olbia. I am anxious to\r\nhear how you are and what you find to amuse you, but above all to see\r\nyou yourself as soon as possible. Take care of your health, my dear\r\nbrother, and though it is winter time, yet reflect that after all it is\r\nSardinia that you are in.[464]\r\n\r\n15 February.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 456: Milo impeached by Clodius before the _comitia tributa_\r\nfor his employment of gladiators. Dio (xxxix. 18) says that Clodius thus\r\nimpeached Milo, not with any hope of securing his conviction against the\r\npowerful support of Cicero and Pompey, but to get the chance of\r\ninsulting these latter. Marcellus was one of the candidates for the\r\nædileship with Clodius.

LENTULUS SPINTHER (IN CILICIA)\r\n\r\nROME (FEBRUARY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nWhat is being done and has been done here I imagine you know from\r\nletters of numerous correspondents and from messengers: but what are\r\nstill matters for conjecture, and seem likely to take place, I think I\r\nought to write and tell you. After Pompey had been roughly treated with\r\nshouts and insulting remarks, while speaking before the people on the\r\n7th of February in defence of Milo, and had been accused in the senate\r\nby Cato in exceedingly harsh and bitter terms amidst profound silence,\r\nhe appeared to me to be very much upset in his mind. Accordingly, he\r\nseems to me to have quite given up any idea of the Alexandrine\r\nbusiness--which, as far as we are concerned, remains exactly where it\r\nwas, for the senate has taken nothing from you except what, owing to the\r\nsame religious difficulty, cannot be granted to anyone else. My hope and\r\nmy earnest endeavour now is that the king, when he understands that he\r\ncannot obtain what he had in his mind--restoration by Pompey--and that,\r\nunless restored by you, he will be abandoned, and neglected, should pay\r\nyou a visit.[465] This he will do without any hesitation, if Pompey\r\ngives the least hint of his approval. But you know that man's deliberate\r\nways and obstinate reserve. However, I will omit nothing that may\r\ncontribute to that result. The other injurious proceedings instituted by\r\nCato I shall, I hope, have no difficulty in resisting. I perceive that\r\nnone of the consulars are friendly to you except Hortensius and\r\nLucullus; the rest are either hostile, without openly shewing it, or\r\nundisguisedly incensed. Keep a brave and high spirit, and feel confident\r\nthat the result will be to utterly repulse the attack of a most\r\ncontemptible fellow, and to retain your high position and fame.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 465: Ptolemy was at Ephesus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIII (F I, 6)\r\n\r\nTO P. LENTULUS SPINTHER (IN CILICIA)\r\n\r\nROME (FEBRUARY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nWhat is going on you will learn from Pollio,[466] who not only was\r\nengaged in all the transactions, but was the leader in them. In my own\r\ndeep distress, occasioned by the course your business has taken,[467] I\r\nam chiefly consoled by the hope which makes me strongly suspect that the\r\ndishonest practices of men will be defeated both by the measures of your\r\nfriends and by mere lapse of time, which must have a tendency to weaken\r\nthe plans of your enemies and of traitors. In the second place, I derive\r\na ready consolation from the memory of my own dangers, of which I see a\r\nreflexion in your fortunes. For though your position is attacked in a\r\nless important particular than that which brought mine to the ground,\r\nyet the analogy is so strong, that I trust you will pardon me if I am\r\nnot frightened at what you did not yourself consider ought to cause\r\nalarm. But shew yourself the man I have known you to be, to use a Greek\r\nexpression, \"since your nails were soft.\"[468] The injurious conduct of\r\nmen will, believe me, only make your greatness more conspicuous. Expect\r\nfrom me the greatest zeal and devotion in everything: I will not falsify\r\nyour expectation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 466: The famous C.

For in conducting the defence I satisfied in the fullest manner\r\npossible a man of difficult temper, and, what he above all things\r\ndesired, I cut up Vatinius (by whom he was being openly attacked) just\r\nas I pleased, with the applause of gods and men. And, farther, when our\r\nfriend Paullus[469] was brought forward as a witness against Sestius, he\r\naffirmed that he would lay an information against Vatinius[470] if\r\nLicinius Macer hesitated to do so, and Macer, rising from Sestius's\r\nbenches, declared that he would not fail. Need I say more? That impudent\r\nswaggering fellow Vatinius was overwhelmed with confusion and thoroughly\r\ndiscredited.\r\n\r\nThat most excellent boy, your son Quintus, is getting on splendidly with\r\nhis education. I notice this the more because Tyrannio[471] gives his\r\nlessons in my house. The building of both your house and mine is being\r\npushed on energetically. I have caused half the money to be paid to\r\nyour contractor. I hope before winter we may be under the same roof. As\r\nto our Tullia, who, by Hercules, is very warmly attached to you, I hope\r\nI have settled her engagement with Crassipes.[472] There are two days\r\nafter the Latin festival which are barred by religion.[473] Otherwise\r\nthe festival of Iuppiter Latiaris has come to an end.\r\n\r\nThe affluence which you often mention I feel the want of to a certain\r\nextent; but while I welcome it if it comes to me, I am not exactly\r\nbeating the covert for it.[474] I am building in three places, and am\r\npatching up my other houses. I live somewhat more lavishly than I used\r\nto do. I am obliged to do so. If I had you with me I should give the\r\nbuilders full swing for a while.[475] But this too (as I hope) we shall\r\nshortly talk over together.\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs at Rome is this: Lentulus Marcellinus is splendid\r\nas consul, and his colleague does not put any difficulty in his way: he\r\nis so good, I repeat, that I have never seen a better. He deprived them\r\nof all the comitial days; for even the Latin festival is being\r\nrepeated,[476] nor were thanksgiving days wanting.[477] In this way the\r\npassing of most mischievous laws is prevented, especially that of\r\nCato,[478] on whom, however, our friend Milo played a very pretty trick.\r\nFor that defender of the employment of gladiators and beast-fighters had\r\nbought some beast-fighters from Cosconius and Pomponius, and had never\r\nappeared in public without them in their full armour. He could not\r\nafford to maintain them, and accordingly had great difficulty in\r\nkeeping them together. Milo found this out. He commissioned an\r\nindividual, with whom he was not intimate, to buy this troop from Cato\r\nwithout exciting his suspicion. As soon as it had been removed,\r\nRacilius--at this time quite the only real tribune--revealed the truth,\r\nacknowledged that the men had been purchased for himself--for this is\r\nwhat they had agreed--and put up a notice that he intended to sell\r\n\"Cato's troop.\" This notice caused much laughter. Accordingly, Lentulus\r\nhas prevented Cato from going on with his laws, and also those who\r\npublished bills of a monstrous description about Cæsar, with no tribune\r\nto veto them. Caninius's proposal, indeed, about Pompey has died a\r\nnatural death. For it is not approved of in itself, and our friend\r\nPompey is also spoken of with great severity for the breach of his\r\nfriendship with Publius Lentulus. He is not the man he was. The fact is\r\nthat to the lowest dregs of the populace his support of Milo gives some\r\noffence, while the aristocrats are dissatisfied with much that he omits\r\nto do, and find fault with much that he does. This is the only point,\r\nhowever, in which I am not pleased with Marcellinus--that he handles him\r\ntoo roughly. Yet in this he is not going counter to the wishes of the\r\nsenate: consequently I am the more glad to withdraw from the\r\nsenate-house and from politics altogether. In the courts I have the same\r\nposition as I ever had: never was my house more crowded. One untoward\r\ncircumstance has occurred owing to Milo's rashness--the acquittal of\r\nSext. Clodius[479]--whose prosecution at this particular time, and by a\r\nweak set of accusers, was against my advice. In a most corrupt panel his\r\nconviction failed by only three votes. Consequently the people clamour\r\nfor a fresh trial, and he must surely be brought back into court. For\r\npeople will not put up with it, and seeing that, though pleading before\r\na panel of his own kidney, he was all but condemned, they look upon him\r\nas practically condemned. Even in this matter the unpopularity of Pompey\r\nwas an obstacle in our path. For the votes of the senators were largely\r\nin his favour, those of the knights were equally divided, while the\r\n_tribuni ærarii_ voted for his condemnation. But for this _contretemps_\r\nI am consoled by the daily condemnations of my enemies, among whom, to\r\nmy great delight, Servius[480] got upon the rocks: the rest are utterly\r\ndone for. Gaius Cato declared in public meeting that he would not allow\r\nthe elections to be held, if he were deprived of the days for doing\r\nbusiness with the people. Appius has not yet returned from his visit to\r\nCæsar. I am looking forward with extraordinary eagerness to a letter\r\nfrom you. Although I know the sea is still closed, yet they tell me that\r\ncertain persons have, nevertheless, arrived from Olbia full of your\r\npraises, and declaring you to be very highly thought of in the province.\r\nThey said also that these persons reported that you intended to cross as\r\nsoon as navigation became possible. That is what I desire: but although\r\nit is yourself, of course, that I most look forward to, yet meanwhile I\r\nlong for a letter. Farewell, my dear brother.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 469: L.

The following are the events\r\nsince then. On the 5th of April, by a decree of the senate, a sum of\r\nmoney amounting to 40,000 sestertia (about £320,000) was voted to Pompey\r\nfor the business of the corn-supply. But on the same day there was a\r\nvehement debate on the Campanian land, the senators making almost as\r\nmuch noise as a public meeting. The shortness of money and the high\r\nprice of corn increased the exasperation. Nor will I omit the following:\r\nthe members of the colleges of the Capitolini and the Mercuriales[481]\r\nexpelled from their society a Roman knight named M. Furius Flaccus, a\r\nman of bad character: the expulsion took place when he was at the\r\nmeeting, and though he threw himself at the feet of each member.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of April, the eve of my departure from town, I gave a\r\nbetrothal party to Crassipes. That excellent boy, your and my Quintus,\r\nwas not at the banquet owing to a very slight indisposition. On the 7th\r\nof April I visited Quintus and found him quite restored. He talked a\r\ngood deal and with great feeling about the quarrels between our wives.\r\nWhat need I say more? Nothing could have been pleasanter. Pomponia,\r\nhowever, had some complaints to make of you also: but of this when we\r\nmeet. After leaving your boy I went to the site of your house: the\r\nbuilding was going on with a large number of workmen. I urged the\r\ncontractor Longilius to push on. He assured me that he had every wish to\r\nsatisfy us. The house will be splendid, for it can be better seen now\r\nthan we could judge from the plan: my own house is also being built with\r\ndespatch. On this day I dined with Crassipes. After dinner I went in my\r\nsedan to visit Pompey at his suburban villa. I had not been able to call\r\non him in the daytime as he was away from home. However, I wished to see\r\nhim, because I am leaving Rome to-morrow, and he is on the point of\r\nstarting for Sardinia. I found him at home and begged him to restore you\r\nto us as soon as possible. \"Immediately,\" he said. He is going to start,\r\naccording to what he said, on the 11th of April, with the intention of\r\nembarking at Livorno or Pisa.[482] Mind, my dear brother, that, as soon\r\nas he arrives, you seize the first opportunity of setting sail, provided\r\nonly that the weather is favourable. I write this on the 8th of April\r\nbefore daybreak, and am on the point of starting on my journey, with the\r\nintention of stopping to-day with Titus Titius at Anagnia. To-morrow I\r\nthink of being at Laterium,[483] thence, after five days in Arpinum,\r\ngoing to my Pompeian house, just looking in upon my villa at Cumæ on my\r\nreturn journey, with the view--since Milo's trial has been fixed for the\r\n7th of May--of being at Rome on the 6th, and of seeing you on that day,\r\nI hope, dearest and pleasantest of brothers. I thought it best that the\r\nbuilding at Arcanum[484] should be suspended till your return. Take good\r\ncare, my dear brother, of your health, and come as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 481: In B.C. 357 a \"college\" was established for celebrating\r\nthe _ludi Capitolini_, in celebration of the failure of the Gauls to\r\ntake it. It consisted of men living on the Capitoline (Livy, v. 50). The\r\n_Mercuriales_ were a \"college\" or company of merchants who celebrated\r\nthe _fête_ of the consecration of the temple of Mercury (B.C., 495) on\r\nthe Ides of May (Livy, ii. 27; Ov. _F._ v. 669; C. _I. L._ i. p. 206).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 482: It was on this journey that Pompey visited Luca tomeet\r\nCæsar and Crassus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 483: The name of a property of Quintus at Arpinum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 484: Another property of Quintus near Mintumæ.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVI (A IV, 4 b)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (RETURNING FROM EPIRUS)\r\n\r\nANTIUM (APRIL)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nIt will be delightful if you come to see us here. You will find that\r\nTyrannio has made a wonderfully good arrangement of my books, the\r\nremains of which are better than I had expected. Still, I wish you would\r\nsend me a couple of your library slaves for Tyrannio to employ as\r\ngluers, and in other subordinate work, and tell them to get some fine\r\nparchment to make title-pieces, which you Greeks, I think, call\r\n\"sillybi.\" But all this is only if not inconvenient to you. In any case,\r\nbe sure you come yourself, if you can halt for a while in such a place,\r\nand can persuade Pilia[485] to accompany you. For that is only fair, and\r\nTullia is anxious that she should come. My word! You have purchased a\r\nfine troop! Your gladiators, I am told, fight superbly. If you had\r\nchosen to let them out you would have cleared your expenses by the last\r\ntwo spectacles. But we will talk about this later on. Be sure to come,\r\nand, as you love me, see about the library slaves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 485: The recently married wife of Atticus. See p. 216.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVII (A IV, 5)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nANTIUM (APRIL)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nDo you really mean it? Do you think that there is anyone by whom I\r\nprefer to have what I write read and approved of before yourself? \"Why,\r\nthen, did I send it to anyone before you?\" I was pressed by the man to\r\nwhom I sent it, and had no copy. And--well! I am nibbling at what I\r\nmust, after all, swallow--my \"recantation\"[486] did seem to me a trifle\r\ndiscreditable! But good-bye to straightforward, honest, and high-minded\r\npolicy! One could scarcely believe the amount of treachery there is in\r\nthose leaders of the state, as they wish to be, and might be, if they\r\nhad any principle of honour in them. I had felt it, known it--taken in,\r\nabandoned, and cast aside by them, as I had been! and yet my purpose\r\nstill was to stick by them in politics. They were the same men as they\r\never had been. At last, on your advice, my eyes have been opened. You\r\nwill say that your advice only extended to action, not to writing also.\r\nThe truth is that I wanted to bind myself to this new combination, that\r\nI might have no excuse for slipping back to those who, even at a time\r\nwhen I could claim their compassion, never cease being jealous of me.\r\nHowever, I kept within due limits in my subject, when I did put pen to\r\npaper. I shall launch out more copiously if _he_ shews that he is glad\r\nto receive it, and those make wry faces who are angry at my possessing\r\nthe villa which once belonged to Catulus, without reflecting that I\r\nbought it from Vettius: who say that I ought not to have built a town\r\nhouse, and declare that I ought to have sold. But what is all this to\r\nthe fact that, when I have delivered senatorial speeches in agreement\r\nwith their own views, their chief pleasure has yet been that I spoke\r\ncontrary to Pompey's wishes? Let us have an end of it. Since those who\r\nhave no power refuse me their affection, let us take care to secure the\r\naffection of those who have power. You will say, \"I could have wished\r\nthat you had done so before.\" I know you did wish it, and that I have\r\nmade a real ass of myself. But now the time has come to shew a little\r\naffection for myself, since I can get none from them on any terms.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged to you for frequently going to see my house.\r\nCrassipes[487] swallows up my money for travelling. Tullia will go\r\nstraight to your suburban villa.[488] That seems the more convenient\r\nplan. Consequently she will be at your town house the next day: for what\r\ncan it matter to you? But we shall see. Your men have beautified my\r\nlibrary by making up the books and appending title-slips. Please thank\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 486: παλινφδία--something he had apparently written and sent\r\nto Pompey or Cæsar, giving in his adhesion to the policy of the\r\ntriumvirs. It can hardly have been the speech _de Provinciis\r\nConsularibus_ or the _oratio pro Balbo_, which had probably not yet been\r\ndelivered, for the arrangement recommended in the former speech was not\r\nthat of the conference of Luca, while in the latter, though he speaks\r\nrespectfully of Cæsar, there is nothing in the shape of a palinode in\r\ngeneral politics.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVIII (F V, 12)\r\n\r\nTO L. LUCCEIUS[489]\r\n\r\nARPINUM (APRIL)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nI have often tried to say to you personally what I am about to write,\r\nbut was prevented by a kind of almost clownish bashfulness. Now that I am\r\nnot in your presence I shall speak out more boldly: a letter does not\r\nblush. I am inflamed with an inconceivably ardent desire, and one, as I\r\nthink, of which I have no reason to be ashamed, that in a history\r\nwritten by _you_ my name should be conspicuous and frequently mentioned\r\nwith praise. And though you have often shewn me that you meant to do so,\r\nyet I hope you will pardon my impatience. For the style of your\r\ncomposition, though I had always entertained the highest expectations of\r\nit, has yet surpassed my hopes, and has taken such a hold upon me, or\r\nrather has so fired my imagination, that I was eager to have my\r\nachievements as quickly as possible put on record in your history. For\r\nit is not only the thought of being spoken of by future ages that makes\r\nme snatch at what seems a hope of immortality, but it is also the desire\r\nof fully enjoying in my lifetime an authoritative expression of your\r\njudgment, or a token of your kindness for me, or the charm of your\r\ngenius. Not, however, that while thus writing I am unaware under what\r\nheavy burdens you are labouring in the portion of history you have\r\nundertaken, and by this time have begun to write. But because I saw that\r\nyour history of the Italian and Civil Wars was now all but finished, and\r\nbecause also you told me that you were already embarking upon the\r\nremaining portions of your work, I determined not to lose my chance for\r\nthe want of suggesting to you to consider whether you preferred to weave\r\nyour account of me into the main context of your history, or whether, as\r\nmany Greek writers have done--Callisthenes, the Phocian War; Timæus, the\r\nwar of Pyrrhus; Polybius, that of Numantia; all of whom separated the\r\nwars I have named from their main narratives--you would, like them,\r\nseparate the civil conspiracy from public and external wars. For my\r\npart, I do not see that it matters much to my reputation, but it does\r\nsomewhat concern my impatience, that you should not wait till you come\r\nto the proper place, but should at once anticipate the discussion of\r\nthat question as a whole and the history of that epoch. And at the same\r\ntime, if your whole thoughts are engaged on one incident and one person,\r\nI can see in imagination how much fuller your material will be, and how\r\nmuch more elaborately worked out. I am quite aware, however, what little\r\nmodesty I display, first, in imposing on you so heavy a burden (for your\r\nengagements may well prevent your compliance with my request), and in\r\nthe second place, in asking you to shew me off to advantage. What if\r\nthose transactions are not in your judgment so very deserving of\r\ncommendation? Yet, after all, a man who has once passed the border-line\r\nof modesty had better put a bold face on it and be frankly impudent. And\r\nso I again and again ask you outright, both to praise those actions of\r\nmine in warmer terms than you perhaps feel, and in that respect to\r\nneglect the laws of history. I ask you, too, in regard to the personal\r\npredilection, on which you wrote in a certain introductory chapter in\r\nthe most gratifying and explicit terms--and by which you shew that you\r\nwere as incapable of being diverted as Xenophon's Hercules by\r\nPleasure--not to go against it, but to yield to your affection for me a\r\nlittle more than truth shall justify. But if I can induce you to\r\nundertake this, you will have, I am persuaded, matter worthy of your\r\ngenius and your wealth of language. For from the beginning of the\r\nconspiracy to my return from exile it appears to me that a\r\nmoderate-sized monograph might be composed, in which you will, on the\r\none hand, be able to utilize your special knowledge of civil\r\ndisturbances, either in unravelling the causes of the revolution or in\r\nproposing remedies for evils, blaming meanwhile what you think deserves\r\ndenunciation, and establishing the righteousness of what you approve by\r\nexplaining the principles on which they rest: and on the other hand, if\r\nyou think it right to be more outspoken (as you generally do), you will\r\nbring out the perfidy, intrigues, and treachery of many people towards\r\nme. For my vicissitudes will supply you in your composition with much\r\nvariety, which has in itself a kind of charm, capable of taking a strong\r\nhold on the imagination of readers, when you are the writer. For nothing\r\nis better fitted to interest a reader than variety of circumstance and\r\nvicissitudes of fortune, which, though the reverse of welcome to us in\r\nactual experience, will make very pleasant reading: for the untroubled\r\nrecollection of a past sorrow has a charm of its own. To the rest of the\r\nworld, indeed, who have had no trouble themselves, and who look upon the\r\nmisfortunes of others without any suffering of their own, the feeling of\r\npity is itself a source of pleasure. For what man of us is not\r\ndelighted, though feeling a certain compassion too, with the death-scene\r\nof Epaminondas at Mantinea? He, you know, did not allow the dart to be\r\ndrawn from his body until he had been told, in answer to his question,\r\nthat his shield was safe, so that in spite of the agony of his wound he\r\ndied calmly and with glory. Whose interest is not roused and sustained\r\nby the banishment and return of Themistocles?[490] Truly the mere\r\nchronological record of the annals has very little charm for us--little\r\nmore than the entries in the _fasti_: but the doubtful and varied\r\nfortunes of a man, frequently of eminent character, involve feelings of\r\nwonder, suspense, joy, sorrow, hope, fear: if these fortunes are crowned\r\nwith a glorious death, the imagination is satisfied with the most\r\nfascinating delight which reading can give. Therefore it will be more in\r\naccordance with my wishes if you come to the resolution to separate from\r\nthe main body of your narrative, in which you embrace a continuous\r\nhistory of events, what I may call the drama of my actions and fortunes:\r\nfor it includes varied acts, and shifting scenes both of policy and\r\ncircumstance. Nor am I afraid of appearing to lay snares for your favour\r\nby flattering suggestions, when I declare that I desire to be\r\ncomplimented and mentioned with praise by you above all other writers.\r\nFor you are not the man to be ignorant of your own powers, or not to be\r\nsure that those who withhold their admiration of you are more to be\r\naccounted jealous, than those who praise you flatterers. Nor, again, am\r\nI so senseless as to wish to be consecrated to an eternity of fame by\r\none who, in so consecrating me, does not also gain for himself the glory\r\nwhich rightfully belongs to genius. For the famous Alexander himself did\r\nnot wish to be painted by Apelles, and to have his statue made by\r\nLysippus above all others, merely from personal favour to them, but\r\nbecause he thought that their art would be a glory at once to them and\r\nto himself. And, indeed, those artists used to make images of the person\r\nknown to strangers: but if such had never existed, illustrious men would\r\nyet be no less illustrious. The Spartan Agesilaus, who would not allow a\r\nportrait of himself to be painted or a statue made, deserves to be\r\nquoted as an example quite as much as those who have taken trouble\r\nabout such representations: for a single pamphlet of Xenophon's in\r\npraise of that king has proved much more effective than all the\r\nportraits and statues of them all. And, moreover, it will more redound\r\nto my present exultation and the honour of my memory to have found my\r\nway into your history, than if I had done so into that of others, in\r\nthis, that I shall profit not only by the genius of the writer--as\r\nTimoleon did by that of Timæus, Themistocles by that of Herodotus--but\r\nalso by the authority of a man of a most illustrious and\r\nwell-established character, and one well known and of the first repute\r\nfor his conduct in the most important and weighty matters of state; so\r\nthat I shall seem to have gained not only the fame which Alexander on\r\nhis visit to Sigeum said had been bestowed on Achilles by Homer, but\r\nalso the weighty testimony of a great and illustrious man. For I like\r\nthat saying of Hector in Nævius, who not only rejoices that he is\r\n\"praised,\" but adds, \"and by one who has himself been praised.\" But if I\r\nfail to obtain my request from you, which is equivalent to saying, if\r\nyou are by some means prevented--for I hold it to be out of the question\r\nthat you would _refuse_ a request of mine--I shall perhaps be forced to\r\ndo what certain persons have often found fault with, write my own\r\npanegyric, a thing, after all, which has a precedent of many illustrious\r\nmen. But it will not escape your notice that there are the following\r\ndrawbacks in a composition of that sort: men are bound, when writing of\r\nthemselves, both to speak with greater reserve of what is praiseworthy,\r\nand to omit what calls for blame. Added to which such writing carries\r\nless conviction, less weight; many people, in fine, carp at it, and say\r\nthat the heralds at the public games are more modest, for after having\r\nplaced garlands on the other recipients and proclaimed their names in a\r\nloud voice, when their own turn comes to be presented with a garland\r\nbefore the games break up, they call in the services of another herald,\r\nthat they may not declare themselves victors with their own voice. I\r\nwish to avoid all this, and, if you undertake my cause, I shall avoid\r\nit: and, accordingly, I ask you this favour. But why, you may well ask,\r\nwhen you have already often assured me that you intended to record in\r\nyour book with the utmost minuteness the policy and events of my\r\nconsulship, do I now make this request to you with such earnestness and\r\nin so many words? The reason is to be found in that burning desire, of\r\nwhich I spoke at the beginning of my letter, for something _prompt_:\r\nbecause I am in a flutter of impatience, both that men should learn what\r\nI am from your books, while I am still alive, and that I may myself in\r\nmy lifetime have the full enjoyment of my little bit of glory. What you\r\nintend doing on this subject I should like you to write me word, if not\r\ntroublesome to you. For if you do undertake the subject, I will put\r\ntogether some notes of all occurrences: but if you put me off to some\r\nfuture time, I will talk the matter over with you. Meanwhile, do not\r\nrelax your efforts, and thoroughly polish what you have already on the\r\nstocks, and--continue to love me.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 487: That is, the dowry and expenses of Tullia's betrothal to\r\nCrassipes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 488: _Tullia de via recta in hortos_, for _tu_, etc., and _ad\r\nte postridie_. This may not be right, but no other suggestions as to the\r\nmeaning of these abrupt clauses have been made which are in the least\r\nconvincing. We must suppose that Atticus has asked Tullia to stay with\r\nhim and his wife Pilia, and Cicero is describing her journey from\r\nAntium.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 489: L.

My consolation is a miserable one,\r\nbut still it is a consolation--that I do not grieve on his account: I\r\ndon't mean in the sense of Saufeius and your Epicurean friends, but, by\r\nHercules, because he loved his country so deeply, that he seems to me to\r\nhave been snatched away by a special favour of providence from its\r\nconflagration. For what could be more humiliating than the life we are\r\nliving, especially mine? For as to yourself, though by nature a\r\npolitician, you have yet avoided having any servitude peculiar to\r\nyourself: you merely come under an appellation common to us all.[491]\r\nBut _I_, who, if I say what I ought about the Republic, am looked on as\r\nmad, if what expediency dictates, as a slave, and if I say nothing, as\r\nutterly crushed and helpless--what must I be suffering? Suffer, indeed,\r\nI do, and all the more keenly that I cannot even shew my pain without\r\nappearing ungrateful. Again: what if I should choose a life of\r\ninactivity and take refuge in the harbour of retired leisure?\r\nImpossible! Rather war and the camp! Am I to serve in the ranks after\r\nrefusing to be a general? I suppose I must. For I perceive you, too,\r\nthink so, you whom I wish that I had always obeyed. All that is left to\r\nme now is, \"You have drawn Sparta: make the best of it!\" But, by\r\nheavens, I can't: and I feel for Philoxenus,[492] who preferred a return\r\nto gaol. However, in my present retirement I am thinking over how to\r\nexpress my rejection of the old policy, and when we meet you will\r\nstrengthen me in it.\r\n\r\nI notice that you have written to me at frequent intervals, but I\r\nreceived all the letters at once. This circumstance increased my grief.\r\nFor I had read three to begin with, in which the report of Lentulus was\r\nthat he was a little better. Then came the thunderbolt of the fourth.\r\nBut it is not he, as I said, who is to be pitied, but we who are so\r\ncallous as to live on.[493] You remind me to write that essay on\r\nHortensius: I have digressed into other subjects, but have not forgotten\r\nyour charge. But, by heaven, at the first line I shrank from the task,\r\nlest I, who seem to have acted foolishly in resenting his intemperate\r\nconduct as a friend, should once more be foolishly rendering his\r\ninjurious treatment of me conspicuous, if I wrote anything; and at the\r\nsame time lest my high _morale_, manifested in my actions, should be\r\nsomewhat obscured in my writing, and this mode of taking satisfaction\r\nshould seem to imply a certain instability. But we shall see. Only be\r\nsure to write me something as often as possible. I sent a letter to\r\nLucceius asking him to write the history of my consulship: be sure you\r\nget it from him, for it is a very pretty bit of writing, and urge him to\r\nuse despatch, and thank him for having written me an answer saying that\r\nhe would do so. Go and see my house as often as you can. Say something\r\nto Vestorius:[494] for he is acting very liberally in regard to me.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 491: Reading _communi fueris nomine_. After all, the meaning\r\nis very doubtful.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 492: Philoxenus, who, having been sent to the quarries by\r\nDionysius of Syracuse, for criticising the tyrant's poetry, was given\r\nanother chance. After reading a few lines he turned away silently.\r\n\"Where are you going?\" said Dionysius. \"Back to the quarries,\" said\r\nPhiloxenus.

LENTULUS SPINTHER (IN CILICIA)\r\n\r\nROME (OCTOBER)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nI have read your letter in which you say that you are obliged for the\r\nfrequent information I give you about all current events, and for the\r\nclear proof you have of my kindness to yourself. The latter--the\r\nregarding you with warm affection--it is my duty to do, if I wish to\r\nmaintain the character which you desired for me; the former it is a\r\npleasure to do, namely, separated as we are by length of space and time,\r\nto converse with you as frequently as possible by means of letters. But\r\nif this shall occur less frequently than you expect, the reason will be\r\nthat my letters are of such a kind that I dare not trust them to\r\neverybody promiscuously. As often as I get hold of trustworthy persons\r\nto whom I may safely deliver them, I will not omit to do so. As to your\r\nquestion about each particular person's loyalty and friendly feelings\r\ntowards you, it is difficult to speak in regard to individuals. I can\r\nventure on this one assertion, which I often hinted to you before, and\r\nnow write from close observation and knowledge--that certain persons,\r\nand those, above all others, who were most bound and most able to help\r\nyou, have been exceedingly jealous of your claims: and that, though the\r\npoint in question is different, your present position is exceedingly\r\nlike what mine was some time ago in this, that those whom you had\r\nattacked on public grounds now openly assail you, while those whose\r\nauthority, rank, and policy you had defended, are not so much mindful of\r\nyour kindness as enemies to your reputation. In these circumstances, as\r\nI wrote you word before, I perceive that Hortensius is very warmly your\r\nfriend, Lucullus anxious to serve you: while of the magistrates L.\r\nRacilius shews special loyalty and affection. For my taking up the\r\ncudgels for you, and advocating your claims, would seem in the eyes of\r\nmost people to be the measure of my obligation to you rather than of my\r\ndeliberate opinion. Besides these I am, in fact, not able to bear\r\nwitness to any one of the consulars shewing zeal or kindness or friendly\r\nfeeling towards you. For you are aware that Pompey, who is very\r\nfrequently accustomed, not on my instigation but of his own accord, to\r\nconfide in me about you, did not often attend the senate during these\r\ndiscussions. It is true your last letter, as I could easily conceive,\r\nwas very gratifying to him. To me, indeed, your reasonableness, or\r\nrather your extreme wisdom, seemed not only charming, but simply\r\nadmirable. For by that letter you retained your hold on a man of lofty\r\ncharacter, who was bound to you by the signal generosity of your conduct\r\ntowards him, but who was entertaining some suspicions that, owing to\r\nthe impression prevailing among certain persons as to his own ambitious\r\ndesires, you were alienated from him. I always thought that he wished to\r\nsupport your reputation, even in that very dubious episode of Caninius's\r\nproposal;[503] but when he had read your letter, I could plainly see\r\nthat he was thinking with his whole soul of you, your honours, and your\r\ninterests. Wherefore look upon what I am going to write as written after\r\nfrequent discussions with him, in accordance with his opinion, and with\r\nthe weight of his authority. It is this: \"That, since no senatorial\r\ndecree exists taking the restoration of the Alexandrine king out of your\r\nhands, and since the resolution written out upon that restoration\r\n(which, as you are aware, was vetoed) to the effect that no one was to\r\nrestore the king at all,[504] has rather the weight of a measure adopted\r\nby men in anger than of a deliberate decision of the senate--you can\r\nyourself see, since you are in possession of Cilicia and Cyprus,[505]\r\nwhat it is within your power to effect and secure; and that, if\r\ncircumstances seem to make it possible for you to occupy Alexandria and\r\nEgypt, it is for your own dignity and that of the empire that, after\r\nhaving first placed the king at Ptolemais or some neighbouring place,\r\nyou should proceed with fleet and army to Alexandria, in order that,\r\nwhen you have secured it by restoring peace and placing a garrison in\r\nit, Ptolemy may go back to his kingdom: thus it will be brought about\r\nthat he is restored at once by your agency, as the senate originally\r\nvoted, and without a 'host,' as those who are scrupulous about religion\r\nsaid was the order of the Sibyl.\"\r\n\r\nBut though both he and I agreed in this decision, we yet thought that\r\nmen would judge of your policy by its result: if it turns out as we wish\r\nand desire, everybody will say that you acted wisely and courageously;\r\nif any hitch occurs, those same men will say that you acted ambitiously\r\nand rashly. Wherefore what you really can do it is not so easy for us to\r\njudge as for you, who have Egypt almost within sight. For us, our view\r\nis this: if you are certain that you can get possession of that\r\nkingdom, you should not delay: if it is doubtful, you should not make\r\nthe attempt. I can guarantee you this, that, if you succeed, you will be\r\napplauded by many while abroad, by all when you return. I see great\r\ndanger in any failure, on account of the senatorial resolution and the\r\nreligious scruple that have been introduced into the question. But for\r\nme, as I exhort you to snatch at what is certain to bring you credit, so\r\nI warn you against running any risks, and I return to what I said at the\r\nbeginning of my letter--that men will judge all you do, not so much from\r\nthe policy which prompted it as from its result. But if this method of\r\nprocedure appears to you to be dangerous, our opinion is that, if the\r\nking fulfils his obligations to those of your friends, who throughout\r\nyour province and sphere of government have lent him money, you should\r\nassist him both with troops and supplies: such is the nature and\r\nconvenient situation of your province, that you either secure his\r\nrestoration by giving him aid, or hinder it by neglecting to do so. In\r\ncarrying out this policy you will perceive better and more easily than\r\nanyone else what the actual state of affairs, the nature of the case,\r\nand the circumstances of the hour admit: what our opinion was I thought\r\nthat I was the person, above all others, to tell you.\r\n\r\nAs to your congratulations to myself on my present position, on my\r\nintimacy with Milo, on the frivolity and impotency of Clodius--I am not\r\nat all surprised that, like a first-rate artist, you take pleasure in\r\nthe brilliant works of your own hands. However, people's\r\nwrong-headedness--I don't like to use a harsher word--surpasses belief;\r\nthey might have secured me by their sympathy in a cause in which they\r\nwere all equally interested, yet they have alienated me by their\r\njealousy: for by their carping and most malicious criticisms I must tell\r\nyou that I have been all but driven from that old political standpoint\r\nof mine, so long maintained, not, it is true, so far as to forget my\r\nposition, but far enough to admit at length some consideration for my\r\npersonal safety also. Both might have been amply secured if there had\r\nbeen any good faith, any solidity in our consulars: but such is the\r\nfrivolity of most of them, that they do not so much take pleasure in my\r\npolitical consistency, as offence at my brilliant position. I am the\r\nmore outspoken in writing this to you, because you lent your support,\r\nnot only to my present position, which I obtained through you, but also\r\nlong ago to my reputation and political eminence, when they were, so to\r\nspeak, but just coming into existence; and at the same time because I\r\nsee that it was not, as I used formerly to think, my want of curule\r\npedigree that excited prejudice: for I have noticed in your case, one of\r\nthe noblest of the land, a similar exhibition of base jealousy, and\r\nthough they did not object to class you among the _noblesse_, they were\r\nunwilling that you should take any higher flight. I rejoice that your\r\nfortune has been unlike mine: for there is a great difference between\r\nhaving one's reputation lowered and one's personal safety abandoned to\r\nthe enemy. In my case it was your noble conduct that prevented me from\r\nbeing too much disgusted with my own; for you secured that men should\r\nconsider more to have been added to my future glory than had been taken\r\nfrom my present fortune. As for you--instigated both by your kindness to\r\nmyself and my affection for you, I urge you to use all your care and\r\nindustry to obtain the full glory, for which you have burned with such\r\ngenerous ardour from boyhood, and never, under anyone's injurious\r\nconduct, to bend that high spirit of yours, which I have always admired\r\nand always loved. Men have a high opinion of you; they loudly praise\r\nyour liberality; they vividly remember your consulship. You must surely\r\nperceive how much more marked, and how much more prominent these\r\nsentiments will be, if backed up by some considerable repute from your\r\nprovince and your government. However, in every administrative act which\r\nyou have to perform by means of your army and in virtue of your\r\n_imperium_, I would have you reflect on these objects long before you\r\nact, prepare yourself with a view to them, turn them over in your mind,\r\ntrain yourself to obtain them, and convince yourself that you can with\r\nthe greatest ease maintain the highest and most exalted position in the\r\nstate. This you have always looked for, and I am sure you understand\r\nthat you have attained it. And that you may not think this exhortation\r\nof mine meaningless or adopted without reason, I should explain that the\r\nconsideration which has moved me to make it was the conviction that you\r\nrequired to be warned by the incidents, which our careers have had in\r\ncommon, to be careful for the rest of your life as to whom to trust and\r\nagainst whom to be on your guard.\r\n\r\nAs to your question about the state of public affairs--there is the most\r\nprofound difference of opinion, but the energy is all on one side. For\r\nthose who are strong in wealth, arms, and material power, appear to me\r\nto have scored so great a success from the stupidity and fickleness of\r\ntheir opponents, that they are now the stronger in moral weight as well.\r\nAccordingly, with very few to oppose them, they have got everything\r\nthrough the senate, which they never expected to get even by the popular\r\nvote without a riot: for a grant for military pay and ten legates have\r\nbeen given to Cæsar by decree,[506] and no difficulty has been made of\r\ndeferring the nomination of his successor, as required by the Sempronian\r\nlaw.[507] I say the less to you on this point, because this position of\r\npublic affairs is no pleasure to me: I mention it, however, in order to\r\nurge you to learn, while you can do so without suffering for it, the\r\nlesson which I myself, though devoted from boyhood to every kind of\r\nreading, yet learnt rather from bitter experience than from study, that\r\nwe must neither consider our personal safety to the exclusion of our\r\ndignity, nor our dignity to the exclusion of our safety.\r\n\r\nIn your congratulations as to my daughter and Crassipes I am obliged to\r\nyou for your kindness, and do indeed expect and hope that this connexion\r\nmay be a source of pleasure to us. Our dear Lentulus, a young man who\r\ngives such splendid promise of the highest qualities, be sure you\r\ninstruct both in those accomplishments which you have yourself ever been\r\nforward in pursuing, and also, above all, in the imitation of yourself:\r\nhe can study in no better school than that. He holds a very high place\r\nin my regard and affection, as well because he is yours, as because he\r\nis worthy of such a father, and because he is devoted to me, and has\r\nalways been so.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 503: See Letter XCV.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 504: See Letter CII.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 505: Joined to the province of Cilicia by Cato in B.C. 58-57.\r\nWhat Cicero is recommending is a clear evasion. Lentulus is not to\r\n_take_ Ptolemy back, but to go to Egypt and make it ready for him.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 506: Cicero says elsewhere that he supported this (_pro\r\nBalbo_, §61; _de Prov.

VALERIUS ORCA (PROCONSUL IN AFRICA)\r\n\r\nROME (MAY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nIf you are well I shall be glad. I am quite well. I presume that you\r\nwill remember that, when escorting you on the commencement of your\r\nofficial journey,[508] I mentioned to you in the presence of Publius\r\nCuspius, and also afterwards urged you privately at some length, that\r\nwhomsoever I might recommend to you as connexions of his, you should\r\nregard as among connexions of my own. You, as was to be expected from\r\nyour extreme regard and uninterrupted attentions to me, undertook to do\r\nthis for me with the utmost liberality and kindness. Cuspius, who is\r\nmost careful in his duties towards all connected with him, takes a\r\nsurprising interest in the well-being of certain persons of your\r\nprovince, because he has been twice in Africa when presiding over the\r\nvery large concerns of his revenue-company. Accordingly, this patronage\r\nof his, which he exercises on their behalf, I am accustomed as far as I\r\ncan to back up by such means and influence as I possess. Wherefore I\r\nthought it necessary to explain to you in this letter why I give letters\r\nof introduction to all the friends of Cuspius. In future letters I will\r\nmerely append the mark[509] agreed upon between you and me, and at the\r\nsame time indicate that he is one of Cuspius's friends. But the\r\nrecommendation which I have resolved to subscribe to in this present\r\nletter, let me tell you, is more serious than any of them. For P.\r\nCuspius has pressed me with particular earnestness to recommend Lucius\r\nIulius to you as warmly as possible. I appear to be barely able to\r\nsatisfy his eagerness by using the words which I generally use when most\r\nin earnest. He asks for something out of the common way from me, and\r\nthinks I have a special knack in that style of writing. I have promised\r\nhim to produce a masterpiece of commendation--a specimen of my choicest\r\nwork. Since I cannot reach that standard, however, I would beg you to\r\nmake him think that some astonishing effect has been produced by the\r\nstyle of my letter. You will secure that, if you treat him with all the\r\nliberality which your kindness can suggest and your official power make\r\nfeasible--I don't mean merely in the way of material assistance, but\r\nalso in words and even in looks: and what influence such things have in\r\na province I could have wished that you had already learnt by\r\nexperience, though I have an idea that you soon will do so. This man\r\nhimself, whom I am recommending to you, I believe to be thoroughly\r\nworthy of your friendship, not only because Cuspius says so (though that\r\nshould be enough), but because I know the keenness of his judgment of\r\nmen and in the selection of his friends. I shall soon be able to judge\r\nwhat has been the effect of this letter, and shall, I feel certain, have\r\nreason to thank you. For myself, I shall with zeal and care see to all\r\nthat I think to be your wish or to concern your interests. Take care of\r\nyour health.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 508: _Paludatum_, lit. dressed in the _paludamentum_, the\r\nmilitary dress in which provincial governors left Rome with _imperium_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 509: _Notam_, some cipher, which he had agreed upon with\r\nValerius to indicate that the _commendatio_ was not to be looked upon as\r\na mere matter of course.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXV (F XIII, 6 b)\r\n\r\nTO Q.

Cuspius, for whose sake you are thoroughly informed from me how\r\nmuch I desire and am bound to do. I earnestly beg you that Cuspius may\r\nhave as great, early, and frequent occasion as possible to thank me for\r\nthis introduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXVI (Q FR II, 6)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (RETURNING FROM SARDINIA)\r\n\r\nROME, MAY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 56, ÆT. 50]\r\n\r\nHow delighted I was to get your letter! It had been expected by me at\r\nfirst, it is true, only with longing, but recently with alarm also. And,\r\nin fact, let me tell you that this is the only letter which has reached\r\nme since the one brought me by your sailor and dated Olbia. But let\r\neverything else, as you say, be reserved till we can talk it over\r\ntogether. One thing, however, I cannot put off: on the 15th of May the\r\nsenate covered itself with glory by refusing Gabinius a _supplicatio_.\r\nProcilius[510] vows that such a slight was never inflicted on anyone.\r\nOut of doors there is much applause. To me, gratifying as it is on its\r\nown account, it is even more so because it was done when I was not in\r\nthe house. For it was an unbiassed[511] judgment of the senate, without\r\nany attack or exercise of influence on my part. The debate previously\r\narranged for the 15th and 16th, namely, the question of the Campanian\r\nland, did not come on. In this matter I don't quite see way.[512] But I\r\nhave said more than I meant to say: for it is best reserved till we\r\nmeet. Goodbye, best and most longed-for of brothers! Fly to me. Our boys\r\nboth share my prayer: of course, you will dine with me the day of your\r\narrival.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 510: One of the tribunes. He was convicted of _vis_ in B.C.,\r\n54.

Coss., Cu. Pompeius Magnus, M. Licinius Crassus.]\r\n\r\n     In this year Cicero devoted much of his time and energy to the\r\n     composition of the _de Oratore_. He was glad to be away from Rome,\r\n     for though he had resolved to give up his opposition to the\r\n     triumvirs, he was never really happy in supporting or even\r\n     witnessing their policy, and the first letter betrays his\r\n     sentiments as to the way in which the consuls had secured their\r\n     election. His fear of an autocracy, however, seems now to be\r\n     directed rather to Pompey than Cæsar; nor was he at all charmed by\r\n     the splendour of the games given at the opening of Pompey's new\r\n     theatre. The only extant speech is that against L. Calpurnius Piso\r\n     (consul B.C. 58) who had been recalled from Macedonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTUSCULUM[513] (JANUARY)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 55, ÆT. 51]\r\n\r\nApenas had scarcely left me, when your letter came. Really? Do you\r\nsuppose he won't propose his law?[514] Pray speak a little louder: I\r\nseem scarcely to have caught what you said. But let me know it at once,\r\nif it is all the same to you, that is! Well, since an additional day has\r\nbeen assigned to the games, I am all the more content to spend that day\r\nwith Dionysius. About Trebonius I cordially agree with you. About\r\nDomitius,[515]\r\n\r\n    \"I swear by Ceres that no single fig\r\n    Was e'er so like another,\"\r\n\r\nas his case to mine, either in the sameness of persons, the\r\nunexpectedness of it, or the futility of the loyalists. There is one\r\ndifference--he has brought it upon himself. For as to the misfortune\r\nitself, I rather think mine is the less grievous. For what could be more\r\nmortifying than that a man, who has been consul-designate, so to speak,\r\never since he was born, should fail in securing his election? Especially\r\nwhen he is the only (plebeian) candidate, or at most had but one\r\nopponent. If it is also the fact, which I rather think it is, that\r\n_he_[516] has in the register of his pocket-book some equally long pages\r\nof future, no less than of past consuls, what more humiliating position\r\nthan our friend's, except that of the Republic? My first information\r\nabout Natta[517] was from your letter: I couldn't bear the man. As to\r\nyour question about my poem: what if it is all agog to escape from my\r\nhands? Well? Would you permit it? About Fabius Luscus--I was just going\r\nto speak of him: the man was always very cordial to me, and I never had\r\nany cause to dislike him; for he is intelligent, very well-behaved, and\r\nserviceable enough. As I was seeing nothing of him, I supposed him to be\r\nout of town: but was told by this fellow Gavius of Firmum, that he was\r\nat Rome, and had never been away. It made a disagreeable impression on\r\nme. \"Such a trifle as that?\" you will say. Well, he had told me a good\r\ndeal of which there could be no doubt as to these brothers of Firmum.\r\nWhat it is that has made him hold aloof from me, if he has done so, I\r\nhave no idea.\r\n\r\nAs to your advice to me to act \"diplomatically\" and keep to the \"outside\r\ncourse\"--I will obey you. But I want still more worldly wisdom, for\r\nwhich, as usual, I shall come to you. Pry small things out from\r\nFabius,[518] if you can get at him, and pick the brains of your guest,\r\nand write me word on these points and all others every day. When there\r\nis nothing for you to write, write and say so. Take care of your health.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 513: The letter appears to be from Tusculum, because Cicero\r\nasks for a letter every day, which he could hardly expect if he were\r\nfarther off. This year Cicero was much away from Rome, and yet his\r\ncorrespondence is meagre compared with other years. So far as this is\r\nnot due to accident in the preservation of his letters, it may be\r\naccounted for by the fact that he was working at his _de Oratore_--so\r\nhard, that even his brother Quintus had scruples in breaking in upon\r\nhim.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 514: This may refer to the laws of Trebonius, giving Pompey\r\nand Crassus Spain and Syria respectively, and Cæsar an additional five\r\nyears in Gaul, or to some of Pompey's own legislation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 515: L.

LENTULUS SPINTHER (IN CILICIA)\r\n\r\nROME (JANUARY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 55, ÆT. 51]\r\n\r\nWhat debates have taken place in the senate, what determination has been\r\ncome to in your business, and what Pompey has undertaken to do, all this\r\nyou will best learn from Marcus Plætorius, who has not only been engaged\r\nin these matters, but has even taken the lead in them, and left nothing\r\nundone which the greatest affection for you, the greatest good sense,\r\nand the greatest care could do. From the same man you will ascertain the\r\ngeneral position of public affairs, which are of such a nature as is not\r\neasy to put in writing. They are, it is true, all in the power of our\r\nfriends, and to such an extent that it does not seem probable that the\r\npresent generation will witness a change. For my part, as in duty bound,\r\nas you advised, and as personal affection and expediency compel, I am\r\nattaching myself to the fortunes of the man whose alliance you thought\r\nyou must court when my fortunes were in question. But you must feel how\r\ndifficult it is to put away a political conviction, especially when it\r\nhappens to be right and proved up to the hilt. However, I conform myself\r\nto the wishes of him from whom I cannot dissent with any dignity: and\r\nthis I do not do, as perhaps some may think, from insincerity; for\r\ndeliberate purpose and, by heaven! affection for Pompey are so powerful\r\nwith me, that whatever is to his interest, and whatever he wishes,\r\nappears to me at once to be altogether right and reasonable. Nor, as I\r\nthink, would even his opponents be wrong if, seeing that they cannot\r\npossibly be his equals, they were to cease to struggle against him. For\r\nmyself I have another consolation--my character is such that all the\r\nworld thinks me justified beyond all others, whether I support Pompey's\r\nviews, or hold my tongue, or even, what is above everything else to my\r\ntaste, return to my literary pursuits. And this last I certainly shall\r\ndo, if my friendship for this same man permits it. For those objects\r\nwhich I had at one time in view, after having held the highest offices\r\nand endured the greatest fatigues--the power of intervening with dignity\r\nin the debates of the senate, and a free hand in dealing with public\r\naffairs--these have been entirely abolished, and not more for me than\r\nfor all. For we all have either to assent to a small clique, to the\r\nutter loss of our dignity, or to dissent to no purpose. My chief object\r\nin writing to you thus is that you may consider carefully what line you\r\nwill also take yourself. The whole position of senate, law courts, and\r\nindeed of the entire constitution has undergone a complete change. The\r\nmost we can hope for is tranquillity: and this the men now in supreme\r\npower seem likely to give us, if certain persons[519] shew somewhat more\r\ntolerance of their despotism. The old consular prestige, indeed, of a\r\ncourageous and consistent senator we must no longer think of: that has\r\nbeen lost by the fault of those who have alienated from the senate both\r\nan order once very closely allied to it, and an individual of the most\r\nillustrious character. But to return to what more immediately affects\r\nyour interests--I have ascertained that Pompey is warmly your friend,\r\nand with him as consul, to the best of my knowledge and belief, you will\r\nget whatever you wish. In this he will have me always at his elbow, and\r\nnothing which affects you shall be passed over by me. Nor, in fact,\r\nshall I be afraid of boring him, for he will be very glad for his own\r\nsake to find me grateful to him. I would have you fully persuaded that\r\nthere is nothing, however small, affecting your welfare that is not\r\ndearer to me than every interest of my own. And entertaining these\r\nsentiments, I can satisfy myself indeed, as far as assiduity is\r\nconcerned, but in actual achievement I cannot do so, just because I\r\ncannot reach any proportion of your services to me, I do not say by\r\nactual return in kind, but by any return even of feeling. There a report\r\nthat you have won a great victory.[520] Your despatch is anxiously\r\nawaited, and I have already talked to Pompey about it. When it arrives,\r\nI will shew my zeal by calling on the magistrates and members of the\r\nsenate: and in everything else which may concern you, though I shall\r\nstrive for more than I can achieve, I shall yet do less than I ought.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 519: The extreme Optimates, such as Cato.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 520: Against the predatory and piratic inhabitants of\r\nCilicia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXIX (Q FR II, 7)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN THE COUNTRY)\r\n\r\nROME (FEBRUARY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 55, ÆT. 51]\r\n\r\nI thought you would like my book:[521] that you like it as much as you\r\nsay I am greatly delighted. As to your hint about my Urania and your\r\nadvice to remember the speech of Iupiter,[522] which comes at the end of\r\nthat book, I do indeed remember it, and that whole passage was aimed at\r\nmyself rather than at the rest of the world. Nevertheless, the day after\r\nyou started I went long before daybreak with Vibullius to call on\r\nPompey; and upon addressing him on the subject of the works and\r\ninscriptions in your honour,[523] he answered me very kindly, gave me\r\ngreat hopes, said he would like to talk to Crassus about it, and advised\r\nme to do so too. I joined in escorting Crassus to his house on his\r\nassuming the consulate: he undertook the affair, and said that Clodius\r\nwould at this juncture have something that he wanted to get by means of\r\nhimself and Pompey: he thought that, if I did not baulk Clodius's views,\r\nI might get what I wanted without any opposition. I left the matter\r\nentirely in his hands and told him that I would do exactly as he wished.\r\nPublius Crassus the younger was present at this conversation, who, as\r\nyou know, is very warmly attached to me. What Clodius wants is an\r\nhonorary mission (if not by decree of the senate, then by popular vote)\r\nto Byzantium or to Brogitarus, or to both.[524] There is a good deal of\r\nmoney in it. It is a thing I don't trouble myself about much, even if I\r\ndon't get what I am trying to get. Pompey, however, has spoken to\r\nCrassus. They seem to have taken the business in hand. If they carry it\r\nthrough, well and good: if not, let us return to my \"Iupiter.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of February a decree passed the senate as to bribery on the\r\nmotion of Afranius, against which I had spoken when you were in the\r\nhouse. To the loudly expressed disapprobation of the senate the consuls\r\ndid not go on with the proposals of those who, while agreeing with\r\nAfranius's motion, added a rider that after their election the prætors\r\nwere to remain private citizens for sixty days.[525] On that day they\r\nunmistakably threw over Cato. In short, they manage everything their own\r\nway, and wish all the world to understand it to be so.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 521: His poem \"On his own Times.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 522: In his poem _de Consulatu suo_, the second book of which\r\n(Urania) ends with a speech of Iupiter, who recommends his leaving\r\npolitics for literature.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 523: A statue in the temple of Tellus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 524: Brogitarus was a Galatian and connexion of Deiotarus.\r\nClodius, as tribune, had done some services to Byzantium, and had also\r\ngot Brogitarus the office of high priest of Cybele. He wants now to go\r\nand get his money for these favours.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 525: The prætorian elections, like the consular, had been put\r\noff till February. Those elected would therefore enter on their office\r\nat once, and so escape prosecution, to which they would have been liable\r\nif, as in ordinary years, they had been \"prætors-designate\" from July to\r\nJanuary. Afranius's motion seems to have been for suspending the bribery\r\nlaws _pro hac vice_. Cato had been beaten: if there had been an\r\nopportunity of impeaching his rivals he might have got in.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXX (A IV, 10)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nCUMÆ, 20 APRIL\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 55, ÆT. 51]\r\n\r\nAt Puteoli there is a great report that Ptolemy has been restored. If\r\nyou have any more certain news, I should like to know it. I am here\r\ndevouring the library of Faustus.[526] Perhaps you thought I was\r\nfeasting on the beauties of Puteoli and the Lucrine lake. Well, I have\r\nthem too. But I declare to heaven that the more I am debarred from the\r\nenjoyment of ordinary pleasures, owing to the political situation, the\r\nmore do I find support and refreshment in literature; and I would rather\r\nbe sitting in that charming seat of yours, under your bust of Aristotle,\r\nthan in _their_[527] curule chair, and be taking a stroll with you\r\nrather than with the great man[528] with whom I see I shall have to\r\nwalk. But as to that walk, let fortune look to it, or god, if there is\r\nany god who cares for such things. I wish, when possible, you would come\r\nand see my walk and Spartan bath, and the buildings planned by Cyrus,\r\nand would urge Philotimus to make haste, that I may have something to\r\nmatch with yours in that department.[529] Pompey came to his Cuman\r\nproperty on the Parilia (19th April).

I have had an interview with Pompey here. He\r\ntalked a good deal to me about politics. He is not at all satisfied with\r\nhimself, to judge from what he says--one is obliged to put in that\r\nproviso in his case. He thinks very little of Syria as a province; talks\r\na good deal about Spain--here, too, I must add, \"to judge from what he\r\nsays,\" and, I think, his whole conversation requires that reservation,\r\nand to be ticketed as Phocylides did his verses--καὶ τόδε\r\nΦωκυλίδου.[531] He expressed gratitude to you for undertaking to\r\narrange the statues:[532] towards myself he was, by Hercules, most\r\neffusively cordial. He even came to my Cuman house to call on me.\r\nHowever, the last thing he seemed to wish was that Messalla should stand\r\nfor the consulship: that is the very point on which I should like to\r\nhear what you know. I am much obliged by your saying that you will\r\nrecommend my fame to Lucceius, and for your frequent inspection of my\r\nhouse. My brother Quintus has written to tell me that, as you have that\r\ndear boy, his son Quintus, staying with you, he intends coming to your\r\nhouse on the 7th of May. I left my Cuman villa on the 26th of April.\r\nThat night I spent at Naples with Pætus. I write this very early on the\r\n27th, on my road to my Pompeian house.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 530: The tribunes had no _veto_ against the censors, they\r\ncould only hinder them by the indirect method of _obnuntiatio_,\r\ndeclaring that the omens were bad, and so preventing business.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 531: This also is Phocylides's.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 532: In Pompey's new theatre.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXII (Q FR II, 8)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nCUMÆ (APRIL)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 55, ÆT. 51]\r\n\r\nAfraid that you will interrupt me--you? In the first place, if I were as\r\nbusy as you think, do you know what interruption means?

Nothing could be more\r\ndelightful! Never, by Hercules, did any crazy poet read with greater\r\nzest his last composition than I listen to you, no matter what business\r\nis in hand, public or private, rural or urban. But it was all owing to\r\nmy foolish scrupulousness that I did not carry you off with me when I\r\nwas leaving town. You confronted me the first time with an unanswerable\r\nexcuse--the health of my son: I was silenced. The second time it was\r\nboth boys, yours and mine: I acquiesced.[534] Now comes a delightful\r\nletter, but with this drop of gall in it--that you seem to have been\r\nafraid, and still to be afraid, that you might bore me. I would go to\r\nlaw with you if it were decent to do so; but, by heaven! if ever I have\r\na suspicion of such a feeling on your part, I can only say that I shall\r\nbegin to be afraid of boring _you_ at times, when in your company.

But I did not like to invite a man of\r\nweak health to a villa practically without a roof, and which even now it\r\nwould be a compliment to describe as unfinished. It would indeed be a\r\nspecial treat to me to have the enjoyment of him here also. For I assure\r\nyou that the neighbourhood of Marius makes the sunshine of that other\r\ncountry residence of mine.[538] I will see about getting him put up in\r\nthe house of Anicius. For I myself, though a student, can live with\r\nworkpeople in the house. I get this philosophy, not from Hymettus, but\r\nfrom Arpinum.[539] Marius is feebler in health and constitution. As to\r\ninterrupting my book[540]--I shall take from you just so much time for\r\nwriting as you may leave me. I only hope you'll leave me none at all,\r\nthat my want of progress may be set down to your encroachment rather\r\nthan to my idleness! In regards to politics, I am sorry that you worry\r\nyourself too much, and are a better citizen than Philoctetes, who, on\r\nbeing wronged himself, was anxious for the very spectacle[541] that I\r\nperceive gives you pain.

But I spoke strongly to him at Antium about\r\nHalimetus's business. He assured me that he would speak seriously to\r\nAquilius.[550] You will see the man therefore, if you please. I think I\r\ncan scarcely be ready for Macro:[551] for I see that the auction at\r\nLarinum is on the Ides and the two days following. Pray forgive me for\r\nthat, since you think so much of Macro. But, as you love me, dine with\r\nme on the 2nd, and bring Pilia. You must absolutely do so. On the 1st I\r\nthink of dining at Crassipes' suburban villa as a kind of inn. I thus\r\nelude the decree of the senate. Thence to my town house after dinner, so\r\nas to be ready to be at Milo's in the morning.[552] There, then, I shall\r\nsee you, and shall march you on with me. My whole household sends you\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 549: L. Egnatius, who owed Q. Cicero money.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 550: C.

FADIUS GALLUS\r\n\r\nROME (MAY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 55, ÆT. 51]\r\n\r\nI had only just arrived from Arpinum when your letter was delivered to\r\nme; and from the same bearer I received a letter from Arrianus,[553] in\r\nwhich there was this most liberal offer, that when he came to Rome he\r\nwould enter my debt to him on whatever day I chose. Pray put yourself in\r\nmy place: is it consistent with your modesty or mine, first to prefer a\r\nrequest as to the day, and then to ask more than a year's credit? But,\r\nmy dear Gallus, everything would have been easy, if you had bought the\r\nthings I wanted, and only up to the price that I wished. However, the\r\npurchases which, according to your letter, you have made shall not only\r\nbe ratified by me, but with gratitude besides: for I fully understand\r\nthat you have displayed zeal and affection in purchasing (because you\r\nthought them worthy of me) things which pleased yourself--a man, as I\r\nhave ever thought, of the most fastidious judgment in all matters of\r\ntaste. Still, I should like Damasippus[554] to abide by his decision:\r\nfor there is absolutely none of those purchases that I care to have.\r\nBut you, being unacquainted with my habits, have bought four or five of\r\nyour selection at a price at which I do not value any statues in the\r\nworld. You compare your Bacchæ with Metellus's Muses. Where is the\r\nlikeness? To begin with, I should never have considered the Muses worth\r\nall that money, and I think all the Muses would have approved my\r\njudgment: still, it would have been appropriate to a library, and in\r\nharmony with my pursuits. But Bacchæ! What place is there in my house\r\nfor them? But, you will say, they are pretty. I know them very well and\r\nhave often seen them. I would have commissioned you definitely in the\r\ncase of statues known to me, if I had decided on them. The sort of\r\nstatues that I am accustomed to buy are such as may adorn a place in a\r\n_palæstra_ after the fashion of gymnasia.[555] What, again, have I, the\r\npromoter of peace, to do with a statue of Mars? I am glad there was not\r\na statue of Saturn also: for I should have thought these two statues had\r\nbrought me debt! I should have preferred some representation of Mercury:\r\nI might then, I suppose, have made a more favourable bargain with\r\nArrianus. You say you meant the table-stand[556] for yourself; well, if\r\nyou like it, keep it. But if you have changed your mind I will, of\r\ncourse, have it. For the money you have laid out, indeed, I would rather\r\nhave purchased a place of call at Tarracina,[557] to prevent my being\r\nalways a burden on my host. Altogether I perceive that the fault is with\r\nmy freedman, whom I had distinctly commissioned to purchase certain\r\ndefinite things, and also with Iunius, whom I think you know, an\r\nintimate friend of Arrianus. I have constructed some new sitting-rooms\r\nin a miniature colonnade on my Tusculan property. I want to ornament\r\nthem with pictures: for if I take pleasure in anything of that sort it\r\nis in painting. However, if I am to have what you have bought, I should\r\nlike you to inform me where they are, when they are to be fetched, and by\r\nwhat kind of conveyance. For if Damasippus doesn't abide by his\r\ndecision, I shall look for some would-be Damasippus,[558] even at a\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nAs to what you say about the house, as I was going out of town I\r\nintrusted the matter to my daughter Tullia:[559] for it was at the very\r\nhour of my departure that I got your letter. I also discussed the matter\r\nwith your friend Nicias, because he is, as you know, intimate with\r\nCassius. On my return, however, before I got your last letter, I asked\r\nTullia what she had done. She said that she had approached Licinia[560]\r\n(though I think Cassius is not very intimate with his sister), and that\r\nshe at once said that she could not venture, in the absence of her\r\nhusband (Dexius is gone to Spain), to change houses without his being\r\nthere and knowing about it. I am much gratified that you should value\r\nassociation with me and my domestic life so highly, as, in the first\r\nplace, to take a house which would enable you to live not only near me,\r\nbut absolutely with me, and, in the second place, to be in such a hurry\r\nto make this change of residence. But, upon my life, I do not yield to\r\nyou in eagerness for that arrangement. So I will try every means in my\r\npower. For I see the advantage to myself, and, indeed, the advantages to\r\nus both. If I succeed in doing anything, I will let you know. Mind you\r\nalso write me word back on everything, and let me know, if you please,\r\nwhen I am to expect you.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 553: C.

MARIUS (AT CUMÆ)\r\n\r\nROME (OCTOBER?)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 55, ÆT. 51]\r\n\r\nIf some bodily pain or weakness of health has prevented your coming to\r\nthe games, I put it down to fortune rather than your own wisdom: but if\r\nyou have made up your mind that these things which the rest of the world\r\nadmires are only worthy of contempt, and, though your health would have\r\nallowed of it, you yet were unwilling to come, then I rejoice at both\r\nfacts--that you were free from bodily pain, and that you had the sound\r\nsense to disdain what others causelessly admire. Only I hope that some\r\nfruit of your leisure may be forthcoming, a leisure, indeed, which you\r\nhad a splendid opportunity of enjoying to the full, seeing that you were\r\nleft almost alone in your lovely country. For I doubt not that in that\r\nstudy of yours, from which you have opened a window into the Stabian\r\nwaters of the bay, and obtained a view of Misenum, you have spent the\r\nmorning hours of those days in light reading, while those who left you\r\nthere were watching the ordinary farces[561] half asleep. The remaining\r\nparts of the day, too, you spent in the pleasures which you had yourself\r\narranged to suit your own taste, while we had to endure whatever had met\r\nwith the approval of Spurius Mæcius.[562] On the whole, if you care to\r\nknow, the games were most splendid, but not to your taste. I judge from\r\nmy own. For, to begin with, as a special honour to the occasion, those\r\nactors had come back to the stage who, I thought, had left it for their\r\nown. Indeed, your favourite, my friend Æsop, was in such a state that no\r\none could say a word against his retiring from the profession. On the\r\nbeginning to recite the oath his voice failed him at the words \"If I\r\nknowingly deceive.\" Why should I go on with the story? You know all\r\nabout the rest of the games, which hadn't even that amount of charm\r\nwhich games on a moderate scale generally have: for the spectacle was so\r\nelaborate as to leave no room for cheerful enjoyment, and I think you\r\nneed feel no regret at having missed it. For what is the pleasure of a\r\ntrain of six hundred mules in the \"Clytemnestra,\" or three thousand\r\nbowls in the \"Trojan Horse,\" or gay-coloured armour of infantry and\r\ncavalry in some battle? These things roused the admiration of the\r\nvulgar; to you they would have brought no delight. But if during those\r\ndays you listened to your reader Protogenes, so long at least as he read\r\nanything rather than my speeches, surely you had far greater pleasure\r\nthan any one of us. For I don't suppose you wanted to see Greek or Oscan\r\nplays, especially as you can see Oscan farces in your senate-house over\r\nthere, while you are so far from liking Greeks, that you generally won't\r\neven go along the Greek road to your villa. Why, again, should I suppose\r\nyou to care about missing the athletes, since you disdained the\r\ngladiators? in which even Pompey himself confesses that he lost his\r\ntrouble and his pains. There remain the two wild-beast hunts, lasting\r\nfive days, magnificent--nobody denies it--and yet, what pleasure can it\r\nbe to a man of refinement, when either a weak man is torn by an\r\nextremely powerful animal, or a splendid animal is transfixed by a\r\nhunting spear? Things which, after all, if worth seeing, you have often\r\nseen before; nor did I, who was present at the games, see anything the\r\nleast new. The last day was that of the elephants, on which there was a\r\ngreat deal of astonishment on the part of the vulgar crowd, but no\r\npleasure whatever. Nay, there was even a certain feeling of compassion\r\naroused by it, and a kind of belief created that that animal has\r\nsomething in common with mankind.[563] However, for my part, during this\r\nday, while the theatrical exhibitions were on, lest by chance you should\r\nthink me too blessed, I almost split my lungs in defending your friend\r\nCaninius Gallus.[564] But if the people were as indulgent to me as they\r\nwere to Æsop, I would, by heaven, have been glad to abandon my\r\nprofession and live with you and others like us. The fact is I was tired\r\nof it before, even when both age and ambition stirred me on, and when I\r\ncould also decline any defence that I didn't like; but now, with things\r\nin the state that they are, there is no life worth having. For, on the\r\none hand, I expect no profit of my labour; and, on the other, I am\r\nsometimes forced to defend men who have been no friends to me, at the\r\nrequest of those to whom I am under obligations. Accordingly, I am on\r\nthe look-out for every excuse for at last managing my life according to\r\nmy own taste, and I loudly applaud and vehemently approve both you and\r\nyour retired plan of life: and as to your infrequent appearances among\r\nus, I am the more resigned to that because, were you in Rome, I should\r\nbe prevented from enjoying the charm of your society, and so would you\r\nof mine, if I have any, by the overpowering nature of my engagements;\r\nfrom which, if I get any relief--for entire release I don't expect--I\r\nwill give even you, who have been studying nothing else for many years,\r\nsome hints as to what it is to live a life of cultivated enjoyment. Only\r\nbe careful to nurse your weak health and to continue your present care\r\nof it, so that you may be able to visit my country houses and make\r\nexcursions with me in my litter. I have written you a longer letter than\r\nusual, from superabundance, not of leisure, but of affection, because,\r\nif you remember, you asked me in one of your letters to write you\r\nsomething to prevent you feeling sorry at having missed the games. And\r\nif I have succeeded in that, I am glad: if not, I yet console myself\r\nwith this reflexion, that in future you will both come to the games and\r\ncome to see me, and will not leave your hope of enjoyment dependent on\r\nmy letters.[565]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 561: _Communis_, which is not satisfactory.

With the latter my connexion and intimacy are so strong,\r\nthat I could not be more anxious if the business were my own. Wherefore\r\nI shall be highly gratified if you take the trouble too make him feel\r\nthat I have as high a place in your affections as I think I have. You\r\ncannot oblige me more than by doing so: and I beg you warmly to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXVIII (F XIII, 40)\r\n\r\nTO Q.

If any recommendations of mine\r\nhave ever had influence with you, as I know that many have had much, I\r\nbeg you to let this one have it. If you treat them with honour and\r\nkindness, you will not only have attached to yourself two very grateful\r\nand excellent young men, but you will also have done me the very\r\ngreatest favour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXIX (A IV, 13)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nTUSCULUM, 15 NOVEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 55, ÆT. 51]\r\n\r\nI see that you know of my arrival at Tusculum on the 14th of November. I\r\nfound Dionysius there. I wish to be at Rome on the 17th. Why do I say\r\n\"wish\"? Rather I am forced to be so. Milo's wedding. There is some idea\r\nof an election. Even supposing that to be confirmed,[566] I am glad to\r\nhave been absent from the wrangling debates which I am told have taken\r\nplace in the senate. For I should either have defended him, which would\r\nhave been against my opinion, or have deserted him whom I was bound to\r\ndefend. But, by Hercules, describe to me to the utmost of your power\r\nthose events, and the present state of politics, and how the consuls\r\nstand this bother. I am very ravenous for news, and, to tell you the\r\ntruth, I feel no confidence in anything. Our friend Crassus indeed,\r\npeople say, started in his official robes with less dignity than in the\r\nold times did L. Paullus,[567] at the same time of life as he is, and,\r\nlike him, in his second consulship. What a sorry fellow! About my\r\noratorical books, I have been working hard. They have been long in hand\r\nand much revised: you can get them copied.[568] I again beg of you an\r\noutline sketch of the present situation, that I may not arrive in Rome\r\nquite a stranger.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 566: _Ego, ut sit rata_, Schutz's reading, which seems the\r\nbest for the unintelligible _ergo et si irata_ of the MSS.

Paullus set out\r\nwith good omens, Crassus with a curse, denounced by the tribune C.\r\nAteius Capito (_de Div._ i. § 29; Plutarch, _Crass._ 16).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 568: By his _librarii_.

Claudius\r\nPulcher.]\r\n\r\n     During this year politics were comparatively uneventful. Crassus\r\n     was gone to Syria. Pompey should have gone to Spain, but at the\r\n     request of the senate he stayed near Rome, and in the autumn his\r\n     wife Iulia died, thus breaking one strong tie between him and\r\n     Cæsar. Quintus Cicero went as _legatus_ to Cæsar and accompanied\r\n     him to Britain. Cicero himself kept up a correspondence with Cæsar,\r\n     and seems to nurse his friendship with him with an almost feverish\r\n     eagerness, which, however, lacks spontaneity. He was engaged this\r\n     year in composing his treatise on the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LICINIUS CRASSUS (ON HIS WAY TO SYRIA)\r\n\r\nROME (JANUARY)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nI have no doubt all your friends have written to tell you what zeal I\r\ndisplayed on the ----[569] in the defence, or you might call it the\r\npromotion, of your official position. For it was neither half-hearted\r\nnor inconspicuous, nor of a sort that could be passed over in silence.\r\nIn fact, I maintained a controversy against both the consuls and many\r\nconsulars with a vehemence such as I have never shewn in any cause\r\nbefore, and I took upon myself the standing defence of all your honours,\r\nand paid the duty I owed to our friendship--long in arrear, but\r\ninterrupted by the great complexity of events--to the very utmost. Not,\r\nbelieve me, that the will to shew you attention and honour was ever\r\nwanting to me; but certain pestilent persons--vexed at another's\r\nfame--did at times alienate you from me, and sometimes changed my\r\nfeelings towards you. But I have got the opportunity, for which I had\r\nrather wished than hoped, of shewing you in the very height of your\r\nprosperity that I remember our mutual kindness and am faithful to our\r\nfriendship. For I have secured not only that your whole family, but that\r\nthe entire city should know that you have no warmer friend than myself.\r\nAccordingly, that most noble of women, your wife, as well as your two\r\nmost affectionate, virtuous, and popular sons, place full confidence in\r\nmy counsel, advice, zeal, and public actions; and the senate and Roman\r\npeople understand that in your absence there is nothing upon which you\r\ncan so absolutely count and depend as upon my exertions, care,\r\nattention, and influence in all matters which affect your interests.\r\nWhat has been done and is being done in the senate I imagine that you\r\nare informed in the letters from members of your family. For myself, I\r\nam very anxious that you should think and believe that I did not stumble\r\nupon the task of supporting your dignity from some sudden whim or by\r\nchance, but that from the first moment of my entering on public life I\r\nhave always looked out to see how I might be most closely united to you.\r\nAnd, indeed, from that hour I never remember either my respect for you,\r\nor your very great kindness and liberality to me, to have failed. If\r\ncertain interruptions of friendship have occurred, based rather on\r\nsuspicion than fact, let them, as groundless and imaginary, be uprooted\r\nfrom our entire memory and life. For such is your character, and such I\r\ndesire mine to be, that, fate having brought us face to face with the\r\nsame condition of public affairs, I would fain hope that our union and\r\nfriendship will turn out to be for the credit of us both. Wherefore how\r\nmuch consideration should in your judgment be shewn to me, you will\r\nyourself decide, and that decision, I hope, will be in accordance with\r\nmy position in the state. I, for my part, promise and guarantee a\r\nspecial and unequalled zeal in every service which may tend to your\r\nhonour and reputation. And even if in this I shall have many rivals, I\r\nshall yet easily surpass them all in the judgment of the rest of the\r\nworld as well as that of your sons, for both of whom I have a particular\r\naffection; but while equally well-disposed to Marcus, I am more entirely\r\ndevoted to Publius for this reason, that, though he always did so from\r\nboyhood, he is at this particular time treating me with the respect and\r\naffection of a second father.\r\n\r\nI would have you believe that this letter will have the force of a\r\ntreaty, not of a mere epistle; and that I will most sacredly observe and\r\nmost carefully perform what I hereby promise and undertake. The defence\r\nof your political position which I have taken up in your absence I will\r\nabide by, not only for the sake of our friendship, but also for the sake\r\nof my own character for consistency. Therefore I thought it sufficient\r\nat this time to tell you this--that if there was anything which I\r\nunderstood to be your wish or for your advantage or for your honour, I\r\nshould do it without waiting to be asked; but that if I received a hint\r\nfrom yourself or your family on any point, I should take care to\r\nconvince you that no letter of your own or any request from any of your\r\nfamily has been in vain. Wherefore I would wish you to write to me on\r\nall matters, great, small, or indifferent, as to a most cordial friend;\r\nand to bid your family so to make use of my activity, advice, authority,\r\nand influence in all business matters--public or private, forensic or\r\ndomestic, whether your own or those of your friends, guests, or\r\nclients--that, as far as such a thing is possible, the loss of your\r\npresence may be lessened by my labour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 569: The date has been lost.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXI (Q FR II, 9)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN THE COUNTRY)\r\n\r\nROME (FEBRUARY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nYour note by its strong language has drawn out this letter. For as to\r\nwhat actually occurred on the day of your start, it supplied me with\r\nabsolutely no subject for writing. But as when we are together we are\r\nnever at a loss for something to say, so ought our letters at times to\r\ndigress into loose chat. Well then, to begin, the liberty of the\r\nTenedians has received short shrift,[570] no one speaking for them\r\nexcept myself, Bibulus, Calidius, and Favonius. A complimentary\r\nreference to you was made by the legates from Magnesia and Sipylum, they\r\nsaying that you were the man who alone had resisted the demand of L.\r\nSestius Pansa.[571] On the remaining days of this business in the\r\nsenate, if anything occurs which you ought to know, or even if there is\r\nnothing, I will write you something every day. On the 12th I will not\r\nfail you or Pomponius. The poems of Lucretius are as you say--with many\r\nflashes of genius, yet very technical.[572] But when you return, ... if\r\nyou succeed in reading the _Empedoclea_ of Sallustius, I shall regard\r\nyou as a hero, yet scarcely human.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 570: Lit. \"has been beheaded with the axe of Tenes,\" mythical\r\nfounder and legislator of Tenedos, whose laws were of Draconian\r\nseverity. A _legatio_ from Tenedos, heard as usual in February, had\r\nasked that Tenedos might be made a _libera civitas_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 571: Some _publicanus_ who had made a charge on the Magnesians\r\nwhich they considered excessive.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 572: Lucretius seems to have been now dead, according to\r\nDonatus 15 October (B.C. 55), though the date is uncertain. I have\r\ntranslated the reading _multæ tamen artis_, which has been changed by\r\nsome to _multæ etiam artis_. But the contrast in the criticism seems to\r\nbe between the fine poetical passages in the _de Rerum Natura_ and the\r\nmass of technical exposition of philosophy which must have repelled the\r\n\"general reader\" at all times. It suggests at once to Cicero to mention\r\nanother poem on a similar subject, the _Empedoclea_ of Sallustius, of\r\nwhich and its writer we know nothing. It was not the historian.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXII (Q FR II, 10)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN THE COUNTRY)\r\n\r\nROME (FEBRUARY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nI am glad you like my letter: however, I should not even now have had\r\nanything to write about, if I had not received yours. For on the 12th,\r\nwhen Appius had got together a thinly-attended meeting of the senate,\r\nthe cold was so great that he was compelled by the general clamour[573]\r\nto dismiss us. As to the Commagenian, because I have blown that\r\nproposition to the winds, Appius makes wonderful advances to me both\r\npersonally and through Pomponius; for he sees that if I adopt a similar\r\nstyle of discussion in the other business, February will not bring him\r\nanything in. And certainly I did chaff him pretty well, and not only\r\nwrenched from his grasp that petty township of his--situated in the\r\nterritory of Zeugma on the Euphrates[574]--but also raised a loud laugh\r\nby my satire on the man's purple-edged toga, which he had been granted\r\nwhen Cæsar was consul.[575] \"His wish,\" said I, \"for a renewal of the\r\nsame honour, to save the yearly re-dying of his purple-edged toga, I do\r\nnot think calls for any decree of the house; but you, my lords, who\r\ncould not endure that the Bostrian[576] should wear the _toga prætexta_,\r\nwill you allow the Commagenian to do so?\" You see the style of chaff,\r\nand the line I took. I spoke at length against the petty princeling,\r\nwith the result that he was utterly laughed out of court. Alarmed by\r\nthis exhibition, as I said, Appius is making up to me. For nothing could\r\nbe easier than to explode the rest of his proposals. But I will not go\r\nso far as to trip him up, lest he appeal to the god of hospitality, and\r\nsummon all his Greeks--it is they who make us friends again. I will do\r\nwhat Theopompus wants. I had forgotten to write to you about Cæsar: for\r\nI perceive what sort of letter you have been expecting. But the fact is,\r\nhe has written word to Balbus that the little packet of letters, in\r\nwhich mine and Balbus's were packed, had been so drenched with rain that\r\nhe was not even aware that there was a letter from me. He had, however,\r\nmade out a few words of Balbus's letter, to which he answered as\r\nfollows: \"I perceive that you have written something about Cicero, which\r\nI have not fully made out: but, as far I could guess, it was of a kind\r\nthat I thought was more to be wished than hoped for.\" Accordingly, I\r\nafterwards sent Cæsar a duplicate copy of the letter. Don't be put off\r\nby that passage about his want of means. In answer to it I wrote back\r\nsaying that he must not stop payment from any reliance on my money\r\nchest, and descanted playfully on that subject, in familiar terms and\r\nyet without derogating from my dignity. His good feeling towards us,\r\nhowever, according to all accounts, is marked. The letter, indeed, on\r\nthe point of which you expect to hear, will almost coincide with your\r\nreturn:[577] the other business of each day I will write on condition of\r\nyour furnishing me with letter-carriers. However, such cold weather is\r\nthreatening,[578] that there is very great danger that Appius may find\r\nhis house frost-bitten and deserted![579]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 573: Retaining _populi convicio_, and explaining _populus_ to\r\nhave the general meaning of the crowd, including senators and\r\nspectators. Cicero uses _populus_ in this vague way elsewhere.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 574: Zeugma I take to mean the \"territory of Zeugma,\" a town\r\non the Euphrates, part of the Roman province of Syria, and close to the\r\nfrontier of Commagene. Antiochus had asked that some stronghold should\r\nbe reckoned as his rather than as belonging to the province.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 575: Appius, he insinuates, hoped to make money by granting\r\nthe request of Antiochus, left king of Commagene by Pompey, for some\r\nspecial privileges, among which was the right of wearing the _toga\r\nprætexta_, which symbolized some position with a shadow of Roman\r\n_imperium_, while at the same time conveying a compliment to the Roman\r\nsuzernainty. See Polyb. lib. xxvi.; xxx. 26; Suet. _Aug._ 60.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 576: Some petty prince of Bostra (_Bozra_), in Arabia, of whom\r\nwe know nothing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 577: Quintus was expecting, what he got, the offer of serving\r\nunder Cæsar as _legatus_. Cæsar was preparing for his second invasion of\r\nBritain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 578: Which will prevent meetings of the senate, and so give me\r\nno news to send you.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 579: There is a _double entendre_. Cold weather will prevent\r\nthe meetings of the senate actually, but metaphorically politics will be\r\nalso cold and dull, and that dullness will probably be nowhere so\r\nevident as in the deserted state of the consul Appius's house, which in\r\nall probability will miss its usual bevy of callers. This\r\nexplanation--put forward by Prof. Tyrrell--is not wholly satisfactory,\r\nyet it is the best that has been given.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXIII (F VII, 5)\r\n\r\nTO CÆSAR (IN GAUL)\r\n\r\nROME (FEBRUARY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nCicero greets Cæsar, _imperator_. Observe how far I have convinced\r\nmyself that you are my second self, not only in matters which concern me\r\npersonally, but even in those which concern my friends. It had been my\r\nintention to take Gaius Trebatius with me for whatever destination I\r\nshould be leaving town, in order to bring him home again honoured as\r\nmuch as my zeal and favour could make him. But when Pompey remained at\r\nhome longer than I expected, and a certain hesitation on my part (with\r\nwhich you are not unacquainted) appeared to hinder, or at any rate to\r\nretard, my departure,[580] I presumed upon what I will now explain to\r\nyou. I begin to wish that Trebatius should look to you for what he had\r\nhoped from me, and, in fact, I have been no more sparing of my promises\r\nof goodwill on your part than I had been wont to be of my own. Moreover,\r\nan extraordinary coincidence has occurred which seems to support my\r\nopinion and to guarantee your kindness. For just as I was speaking to\r\nour friend Balbus[581] about this very Trebatius at my house, with more\r\nthan usual earnestness, a letter from you was handed to me, at the end\r\nof which you say: \"Miscinius Rufus,[582] whom you recommend to me, I\r\nwill make king of Gaul, or, if you choose, put him under the care of\r\nLepta. Send me some one else to promote.\" I and Balbus both lifted our\r\nhands in surprise: it came so exactly in the nick of time, that it\r\nappeared to be less the result of mere chance than something\r\nprovidential. I therefore send you Trebatius, and on two grounds, first\r\nthat it was my spontaneous idea to send him, and secondly because you\r\nhave invited me to do so. I would beg you, dear Cæsar, to receive him\r\nwith such a display of kindness as to concentrate on his single person\r\nall that you can be possibly induced to bestow for my sake upon my\r\nfriends. As for him I guarantee--not in the sense of that hackneyed\r\nexpression of mine, at which, when I used it in writing to you about\r\nMilo, you very properly jested, but in good Roman language such as sober\r\nmen use--that no honester, better, or more modest man exists. Added to\r\nthis, he is at the top of his profession as a jurisconsult, possesses an\r\nunequalled memory, and the most profound learning. For such a man I ask\r\nneither a tribuneship, prefecture, nor any definite office, I ask only\r\nyour goodwill and liberality: and yet I do not wish to prevent your\r\ncomplimenting him, if it so please you, with even these marks of\r\ndistinction. In fact, I transfer him entirely from my hand, so to speak,\r\nto yours, which is as sure a pledge of good faith as of victory. Excuse\r\nmy being somewhat importunate, though with a man like you there can\r\nhardly be any pretext for it--however, I feel that it will be allowed to\r\npass. Be careful of your health and continue to love me as ever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 580: Pompey had two functions at this time: he was governor of\r\nSpain and _præfectus annonæ_. The latter office, as being extraordinary,\r\nmight be, perhaps, held with the other without an actual breach of law,\r\nbut it was certainly against the spirit of the constitution. Cicero\r\nknows that Pompey's staying in Italy and governing his province by\r\n_legati_ will not be acceptable to Cæsar, and he alludes to it in\r\ncarefully guarded terms. He had been named his _legatus_ when Pompey\r\nfirst undertook the care of the corn-supply, but it does not seem as if\r\nhe ever seriously contemplated going on actual service.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 581: L. Cornelius Balbus, whom Cicero defended, and who acted\r\nas Cæsar's agent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 582: The name of the person jocosely referred to by Cæsar is\r\nuncertain, from corruption of the text. Q. Lepta is Cæsar's _præfectus\r\nfabrum_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXIV (Q FR II, 11 [13])\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN THE COUNTRY)\r\n\r\nROME (15 FEBRUARY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nYour \"black snow\"[583] made me laugh, and I am very glad that you are in\r\na cheerful frame of mind and ready for a joke. As to Pompey, I agree\r\nwith you, or rather you agree with me. For, as you know, I have long\r\nbeen singing the praises of your Cæsar. Believe me, he is very close to\r\nmy heart, and I am not going to let him slip from his place. Now for the\r\nhistory of the Ides (13th). It was Cælius's tenth day.[584] Domitius had\r\nnot obtained a full panel. I am afraid that foul ruffian, Servius Pola,\r\nwill appear for the prosecution. For our friend Cælius has a dead set\r\nmade at him by the Clodian gens. There is nothing certain as yet, but I\r\nam afraid. On the same day there was a full house for the case of the\r\nTyrians: the _publicani_ of Syria appeared in large numbers against\r\nthem. Gabinius was abused roundly:[585] the _publicani_ were also\r\ndenounced by (the consul) Domitius for having escorted him on his start\r\non horseback. Our friend Lucius Lamia was somewhat insolent: for on\r\nDomitius saying, \"It is your fault, equites of Rome, that such things\r\nhave happened: for you give verdicts laxly,\" he said, \"Yes, we give\r\nverdicts, but you senators give evidence of character.\"[586] Nothing was\r\ndone that day: the house stood adjourned at nightfall. On the comitial\r\ndays which follow the Quirinalia (17th February), Appius holds the view\r\nthat he is not prevented by the _lex Pupia_ from holding a meeting of\r\nthe senate, and that by the _lex Gabinia_ he is even compelled to have a\r\nmeeting for the legations from the 1st of February to the 1st of\r\nMarch.[587] And so the elections are supposed to be put off till March.\r\nNevertheless, on these comitial days the tribunes say that they will\r\nbring forward the case of Gabinius.[588] I collect every item of\r\nintelligence, that I may have some news to tell you: but, as you see, I\r\nam short of material. Accordingly, I return to Callisthenes and\r\nPhilistus, in whom I see that you have been wallowing. Callisthenes is a\r\ncommonplace and hackneyed piece of business, like a good many Greeks.\r\nThe Sicilian is a first-rate writer, terse, sagacious, concise, almost a\r\nminor Thucydides;[589] but which of his two books you have--for these\r\nare two works--I don't know. That about Dionysius is my favourite. For\r\nDionysius himself is a magnificent intriguer, and was familiarly known\r\nto Philistus. But as to your postscript--are you really going in for\r\nwriting history? You have my blessing on your project: and since you\r\nfurnish me with letter-carriers, you shall hear to-day's transactions on\r\nthe Lupercalia (15th February). Enjoy yourself with our dear boy to your\r\nheart's content.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 583: We cannot tell the allusion, not having the letter of\r\nQuintus. But he seems to have used the expression for something\r\nincongruous either in politics, or in regard to his contemplated\r\nservices with Cæsar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 584: _I.e._, the day he had to appear for trial, usually fixed\r\nby the prætor on the tenth day from the notice of prosecution. Cælius\r\nhad been acqiuitted in B.C. 56, when Cicero defended him; this second\r\ntrial appears to have in some way fallen through. The prætor Domitius is\r\nsaid to be Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, son of Lucius, but he was much too\r\nyoung to have been prætor this year. The former trial of Cælius (B.C.\r\n56) had been before Cn. Comitius Calvinus, hence a difficulty about this\r\npassage. For the prætor Domitius of this year is not known. Domitius\r\nCalvinus was prætor B.C. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 585: The _publicani_ of Syria were enraged with Gabinius for\r\nneglecting his province while going to Egypt, thus allowing the pirates\r\nso to plunder that they could not collect enough dues to recoup them for\r\ntheir bargain to the state (Dio, xxxix. 59).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 586: L. Ælius Lamia, an eques, appears to have been one of the\r\ndeputation of _publicani_ who attended the senate to accuse Gabinius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 587: The prætorian elections were again postponed from the\r\nprevious year to the early months of B.C. 54. Appius Claudius found\r\nmeans to put them off till March by holding meetings of the senate each\r\nday--the electoral _comita_ not being able to meet on the same day as\r\nthe senate.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 588: The tribune C. Memmius was prosecuting Gabinius (Letter\r\nCXLVII). The judicial _comita_ could meet, though not the electoral.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 589: Callisthenes of Olynthus wrote (1) a history of the\r\nTrojan war; (2) an account of Alexander the Great. Philistus of Syracuse\r\n(1) a history of Sicily; (2) a life of Dionysius the elder; (3) a life\r\nof Dionysius the younger. He imitated Thucydides (_de Orat._ § 17).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXV (F VII, 6)\r\n\r\nTO C. TREBATIUS TESTA (IN GAUL)\r\n\r\nCUMÆ (APRIL)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nIn all my letters to Cæsar or Balbus there is a sort of statutory\r\nappendix containing a recommendation of you, and not one of the ordinary\r\nkind, but accompanied by some signal mark of my warm feeling towards\r\nyou. See only that you get rid of that feeble regret of yours for the\r\ncity and city ways, and carry out with persistence and courage what you\r\nhad in your mind when you set out. We, your friends, shall pardon your\r\ngoing away for that purpose as much as\r\n\r\n    \"The wealthy noble dames who held the Corinthian peak\"\r\n\r\npardoned Medea, whom, with hands whitened to the utmost with chalk, she\r\npersuaded not to think ill of her for being absent from her fatherland:\r\nfor\r\n\r\n    \"Many have served themselves abroad and served the state as well;\r\n    Many have spent their lives at home to be but counted fools.\"\r\n\r\nIn which latter category you would have certainly been, had I not forced\r\nyou abroad. But I will write more another time. You who learnt to look\r\nout for others, look out, while in Britain, that you are not yourself\r\ntaken in by the charioteers; and, since I have begun quoting the\r\n_Medea_, remember this line:\r\n\r\n    \"The sage who cannot serve himself is vainly wise I ween.\"\r\n\r\nTake care of your health.[590]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 590: Trebatius is going to join Cæsar, who is about to sail to\r\nBritain; hence the jest about the _essedarii_, drivers of Gallic and\r\nBritish war-chariots. Letter CXXXIII recommended him to Cæsar. The lines\r\nquoted are from the _Medea_ of Ennius, adapted or translated from\r\nEuripides. I date these two letters from Cumæ, because he speaks of\r\nwriting to Balbus, who was at Rome (p. 267).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXVI (F VII, 7)\r\n\r\nTO C.

My chief hope is in Balbus,\r\nto whom I write about you with the greatest earnestness and frequency.\r\nIt often excites my wonder that I don't hear from you as often as\r\nfrom my brother Quintus. In Britain I am told there is no gold or\r\nsilver. If that turns out to be the case, I advise you to capture a\r\nwar-chariot and hasten back to us at the earliest opportunity. But\r\nif--letting Britain alone--we can still obtain what we want, take care\r\nto get on intimate terms with Cæsar. In that respect my brother will be\r\nof much use to you, so will Balbus, but most of all, believe me, your\r\nown modesty and industry. You have an _imperator_ of the most liberal\r\ncharacter, your age is exactly the best one for employment, and your\r\nrecommendation at any rate is quite unique, so that all you have to fear\r\nis not doing yourself full justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXVII (A IV, 14)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (ON A JOURNEY)\r\n\r\nCUMÆ (MAY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nOur friend Vestorius[591] has informed me by letter that you are\r\nbelieved to have left Rome on the 10th of May--later than you said that\r\nyou intended--because you had not been very well. If you are now better\r\nI rejoice indeed. I wish you would write to your town house, ordering\r\nyour books to be at my service just as if you were at home, especially\r\nthose of Varro. For I have occasion to use some passages of those books\r\nin reference to those which I have in hand, and which, I hope, will meet\r\nwith your strong approval.[592] Pray, if by chance you have any news,\r\nprincipally from my brother Quintus, next from Cæsar, and, finally,\r\nanything about the elections or about politics--for you have an\r\nexcellent nose for such things--write and tell me about them: if you\r\nhave no news, nevertheless write something. For a letter from you never\r\nyet seemed to me either ill-timed or too long-winded. But above all I\r\nbeg that, when your business and your whole tour has been concluded to\r\nyour mind, you will come back to us as soon as possible. Give my\r\ncompliments to Dionysius. Take care of your health.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 591: A banker at Puteoli.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 592: The six books on the Republic.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXVIII (Q FR II, 12 [14])\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL)\r\n\r\nCUMÆ (MAY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nI have up to now received two letters from you, one just as I was\r\nleaving town, the other dated Ariminum: others which you say in your\r\nletter that you have sent I have not received. I am having a fairly\r\npleasant time (except that you are not here) at Cumæ and Pompeii, and\r\nintend staying in these parts till the 1st of June. I am writing the\r\ntreatise of which I spoke to you, \"On the Republic,\" a very bulky and\r\nlaborious work. But if it turns out as I wish, it will be labour well\r\nbestowed, and if not I shall toss it into the very sea which I have\r\nbefore my eyes as I write, and set to work on something else; since to\r\ndo nothing is beyond my power. I will carefully observe your instruction\r\nboth as to attaching certain persons to myself and not alienating\r\ncertain others. But my chief care will be to see your son, or rather\r\nour son, if possible, every day at any rate, and to watch the progress\r\nof his education as often as possible; and, unless he declines my help,\r\nI will even offer to be his instructor, a practice to which I have\r\nbecome habituated in the leisure of these days while bringing my own\r\nboy, the younger Cicero, on. Yes, do as you say in your letter, what,\r\neven if you had not said so, I know you do with the greatest\r\ncare--digest, follow up, and carry out my instructions. For my part,\r\nwhen I get to Rome, I will let no letter-carrier of Cæsar go without a\r\nletter for you. During these days you must excuse me: there has been no\r\none to whom I could deliver a letter until the present bearer M. Orfius,\r\na Roman knight, a man that is my friend as well from personal\r\nconsideration as because he comes from the _municipium_ of Atella,[593]\r\nwhich you know is under my patronage. Accordingly, I recommend him to\r\nyou with more than common warmth, as a man in a brilliant position in\r\nhis own town and looked up to even beyond it. Pray attach him to\r\nyourself by your liberal treatment of him: he is a military tribune in\r\nyour army. You will find him grateful and attentive. I earnestly beg you\r\nto be very friendly to Trebatius.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 593: A _municipium_ of Campania nine miles from Naples.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXIX (F VII, 8)\r\n\r\nTO C. TREBATIUS TESTA (IN GAUL)\r\n\r\nROME (JUNE)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nCæsar has written me a very courteous letter saying that he has not yet\r\nseen as much of you as he could wish, owing to his press of business,\r\nbut that he certainly will do so. I have answered his letter and told\r\nhim how much obliged I shall be if he bestows on you as much attention,\r\nkindness, and liberality as he can. But I gathered from your letters\r\nthat you are in somewhat too great a hurry: and at the same time I\r\nwondered why you despised the profits of a military tribuneship,\r\nespecially as you are exempted from the labour of military duty. I shall\r\nexpress my discontent to Vacerra and Manilius: for I dare not say a word\r\nto Cornelius,[594] who is responsible for your unwise conduct, since you\r\nprofess to have learnt legal wisdom from him. Rather press on your\r\nopportunity and the means put into your hands, than which none better\r\nwill ever be found. As to what you say of the jurist Precianus, I never\r\ncease recommending you to him; for he writes me word that you owe him\r\nthanks. Be sure to let me know to what that refers. I am waiting for a\r\nletter from you dated \"Britain.\"[595]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 594: Vacerra, Manilius, Cornelius, well-known lawyers or\r\njurists of the day.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 595: We shall afterwards see that Trebatius did not go to\r\nBritain.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXL (Q FR II, 13)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL)\r\n\r\nROME (3 JUNE)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of June, the day of my return to Rome, I received your letter\r\ndated Placentia: then next day another dated Blandeno, along with a\r\nletter from Cæsar filled full of courteous, earnest, and pleasant\r\nexpressions. These expressions are indeed valuable, or rather _most_\r\nvaluable, as tending very powerfully to secure our reputation and\r\nexalted position in that state. But believe me--for you know my\r\nheart--that what I value most in all this I already possess, that is,\r\nfirst of all, your active contribution to our common position; and,\r\nsecondly, all that warm affection of Cæsar for me, which I prefer to all\r\nthe honours which he desires me to expect at his hands. His letter too,\r\ndespatched at the same time as your own--which begins by saying what\r\npleasure your arrival and the renewed memory of our old affection had\r\ngiven him, and goes on to say that he will take care that, in the midst\r\nof my sorrow and regret at losing you, I shall have reason to be glad\r\nthat you are with him of all people--gave me extraordinary delight.\r\nWherefore you, of course, are acting in a truly brotherly spirit when\r\nyou exhort me, though, by heaven, I am now indeed forward enough to do\r\nso, to concentrate all my attentions upon him alone. Yes, I will do so,\r\nindeed, with a burning zeal: and perhaps I shall manage to accomplish\r\nwhat is frequently the fortune of travellers when they make great haste,\r\nwho, if they have got up later than they intended, have, by increasing\r\ntheir speed, arrived at their destination sooner than if they had waked\r\nup before daylight. Thus I, since I have long overslept myself in\r\ncultivating that great man, though you, by heaven, often tried to wake\r\nme up, will make up for my slowness with horses and (as you say he likes\r\nmy poem) a poet's chariots. Only let me have Britain to paint in colours\r\nsupplied by yourself, but with my own brush. But what am I saying? What\r\nprospect of leisure have I, especially as I remain at Rome in accordance\r\nwith his request? But I will see. For perhaps, as usual, my love for you\r\nwill overcome all difficulties. For my having sent Trebatius to him he\r\neven thanks me in very witty and polite terms, remarking that there was\r\nno one in the whole number of his staff who knew how to draw up a\r\nrecognizance. I have asked him for a tribuneship for M. Curtius--since\r\nDomitius (the consul) would have thought that he was being laughed at,\r\nif my petition had been addressed to him, for his daily assertion is\r\nthat he hasn't the appointment of so much as a military tribune: he even\r\njested in the senate at his colleague Appius as having gone to visit\r\nCæsar,[596] that he might get from him at least one tribuneship. But my\r\nrequest was for next year, for that was what Curtius wished. Whatever\r\nline you think I ought to take in politics and in treating my opponents,\r\nbe sure I shall take, and shall be \"gentler than any ear-lap.\" Affairs\r\nat Rome stand thus; there is some hope of the elections taking place,\r\nbut it is an uncertain one. There is some latent idea of a\r\ndictatorship,[597] but neither is that confirmed. There is profound calm\r\nin the forum, but it is rather the calm of decrepitude than content.\r\nThe opinions I express in the senate are of a kind to win the assent of\r\nothers rather than my own:\r\n\r\n    \"Such the effects of miserable war.\"[598]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 596: At Luca in the year B.C. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 597: _Comitia habendi causa_. No such had been appointed since\r\nB.C. 202, and the irregular dictatorship of Sulla in B.C. 82 made the\r\nidea distasteful. Pompey was understood to wish for the appointment, now\r\nand later on. See pp. 326, 335.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 598: τοιαῦθ' ὁ τλήμων πόλεμος ἐξεργάζεται (Eur. _Supp._ 119).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXLI (Q FR II, 14 [15 b])\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL)\r\n\r\nROME (JULY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nWell! this time I'll use a good pen, well-mixed ink, and superfine\r\npaper. For you say you could hardly read my previous letter, for which,\r\nmy dear brother, the reason was none of those which you suppose. For I\r\nwas not busy, nor agitated, nor out of temper with some one: but it is\r\nalways my way to take the first pen that turns up and use it as if it\r\nwere a good one. But now attend, best and dearest of brothers, to my\r\nanswer to what you wrote in this same short letter in such a very\r\nbusiness-like way. On this subject you beg that I should write back to\r\nyou with brotherly candour, without concealment, or reserve, or\r\nconsideration for your feelings--I mean whether you are to hasten home,\r\nas we had talked of, or to stay where you are, if there is any excuse\r\nfor doing so, in order to extricate yourself from your embarrassments.\r\nIf, my dear Quintus, it were some small matter on which you were asking\r\nmy opinion, though I should have left it to you to do what you chose, I\r\nshould yet have shewn you what mine was. But on this subject your\r\nquestion amounts to this--what sort of year I expect the next to be?\r\nEither quite undisturbed as far as we are concerned, or at any rate one\r\nthat will find us in the highest state of preparation for defence. This\r\nis shewn by the daily throng at my house, my reception in the forum, the\r\ncheers which greet me in the theatre. My friends feel no anxiety,\r\nbecause they know the strength of my position in my hold upon the\r\nfavour both of Cæsar and Pompey. These things give me entire\r\nconfidence. But if some furious outbreak of that madman occurs,\r\neverything is ready for crushing him. This is my feeling, my deliberate\r\nopinion: I write to you with entire confidence. I bid you have no\r\ndoubts, and I do so with no intention of pleasing you, but with\r\nbrotherly frankness. Therefore, while I should wish you to come at the\r\ntime you arranged, for the sake of the pleasure we should have in each\r\nother's society, yet I prefer the course you yourself think the better\r\none. I, too, think these objects of great importance--ample means for\r\nyourself and extrication from your load of debt. Make up your mind to\r\nthis, that, free from embarrassments, we should be the happiest people\r\nalive if we keep well. For men of our habits the deficiency is small,\r\nand such as can be supplied with the greatest ease, granted only that we\r\nkeep our health.\r\n\r\nThere is an enormous recrudescence of bribery. Never was there anything\r\nequal to it. On the 15th of July the rate of interest rose from four to\r\neight per cent., owing to the compact made by Memmius with the consul\r\nDomitius:[599] I wish Scaurus could get the better of it. Messalla is\r\nvery shaky. I am not exaggerating--they arrange to offer as much as\r\n10,000 sestertia (about £80,000) for the vote of the first century. The\r\nmatter is a burning scandal. The candidates for the tribuneship have\r\nmade a mutual compact--having deposited 500 sesteria (about £4,000)\r\napiece with Cato, they agree to conduct their canvass according to his\r\ndirection, with the understanding that anyone offending against it is to\r\nbe condemned by him. If this election then turns out to be pure, Cato\r\nwill have been of more avail than all laws and jurors put together.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 599: For the nature of this compact, see p. 300.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXLII (A IV, 16 AND PART OF 17)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS OR ON HIS JOURNEY TO ASIA)\r\n\r\nROME (? 24 JUNE)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nThe bare fact of my letter being by the hand of an amanuensis will be a\r\nsign of the amount of my engagements. I have no fault to find with you\r\nas to the number of your letters, but most of them told me nothing\r\nexcept where you were, or at most shewed by the fact that they came from\r\nyou that no harm had happened to you. Of this class of letters there\r\nwere two which gave me very great pleasure, dated by you from Buthrotum\r\nalmost at the same time: for I was anxious to know that you had had a\r\nfavourable crossing. But this constant supply of your letters did not\r\ngive me so much pleasure by the richness of their contents as by their\r\nfrequency. The one which your guest, M. Paccius, delivered to me was\r\nimportant and full of matter. I will therefore answer it. And this is\r\nthe first thing I have to say: I have shewn Paccius, both by word and\r\ndeed, what weight a recommendation from you has: accordingly, he is\r\namong my intimate friends, though unknown to me before. Now for the\r\nrest. Varro, of whom you write, shall be got in somewhere, if I can but\r\nfind a place for him.[600] But you know the style of my Dialogues: just\r\nas in those \"On the Orator,\" which you praise to the skies, a mention of\r\nanyone by the interlocutors was impossible, unless he had been known to\r\nor heard of by them, so in the \"Dialogue on the Republic,\" which I have\r\nbegun, I have put the discussion in the mouths of Africanus, Philus,\r\nLælius, and Manilius. I have added two young men, Q. Tubero and P.\r\nRutilius, and the two sons-in-law of Lælius, Scævola and Fannius. So I\r\nam thinking how (since I employ introductions to each book, as\r\nAristotle does in what he calls his \"Exoterics\") to contrive some\r\npretext for naming your friend in a natural way, as I understand is your\r\nwish. May I only be enabled to carry out my attempt! For, as you cannot\r\nbut observe, I have undertaken a subject wide, difficult, and requiring\r\nthe utmost leisure--the very thing that, above all others, I lack. In\r\nthose books which you commend you complain of the absence of Scævola\r\namong the speakers. Well, I did not withdraw him without a set purpose,\r\nbut I did exactly what that god of our idolatry, Plato, did in his\r\nRepublic. When Socrates had come to the Piræus on a visit to Cephalus, a\r\nwealthy and cheerful old man, during all the introductory conversation\r\nthe old man takes part in the discussion; then, after having himself\r\nmade a speech very much to the point, he says that he wants to go away\r\nto attend on the religious rites, and does not return again. I believe\r\nPlato hardly thought that it would be quite natural, if he kept a man of\r\nthat age any longer in a conversation so protracted. I thought that I\r\nwas bound to be still more careful in the case of Scævola, who was at\r\nthe age and with the broken health as you remember he then was, and who\r\nhad enjoyed such high offices, that it was scarcely in accordance with\r\netiquette for him to be staying several days in the Tusculan villa of\r\nCrassus. Besides, the conversation in the first book was not unconnected\r\nwith Scævola's special pursuits: the other books, as you know, contain a\r\ntechnical discussion. In such I was unwilling that that facetious\r\nveteran, as you know he was, should take part.\r\n\r\nAs to Pilia's business, which you mention, I will see to it. For the\r\nmatter is quite clear, as you say, from the information supplied by\r\nAurelianus, and in managing it I shall have also an opportunity of\r\nglorifying myself in my Tullia's eyes. I am supporting Vestorius: for I\r\nknow that it gratifies you, and I am careful that he would understand\r\nthat to be the case. But do you know the sort of man he is? Though he\r\nhas two such good-natured people to deal with, nothing can exceed his\r\nimpracticability. Now as to what you ask about Gaius Cato. You know that\r\nhe was acquitted under the _lex Iunia Licinia_:[601] I have to tell you\r\nthat he will be acquitted under the _lex Fufia_,[602] and not so much to\r\nthe satisfaction of his defenders as of his accusers. However, he has\r\nbecome reconciled to myself and Milo. Drusus has had notice of\r\nprosecution by Lucretius. The 3rd of July is the day fixed for\r\nchallenging his jurors. About Procilius[603] there are sinister\r\nrumours--but you know what the courts are. Hirrus is on good terms with\r\nDomitius.[604] The senatorial decree which the present consuls have\r\ncarried about the provinces--\"whoever henceforth, etc.\"--does not seem\r\nto me likely to have any effect.\r\n\r\nAs to your question about Messalla, I don't know what to say: I have\r\nnever seen candidates so closely matched. Messalla's means of support\r\nyou know. Scaurus has had notice of prosecution from Triarius. If you\r\nask me, no great feeling of sympathy for him has been roused. Still, his\r\nædileship is remembered with some gratitude, and he has a certain hold\r\non the country voters from the memory of his father. The two remaining\r\nplebeian candidates have compensating advantages which make them about\r\nequal: Domitius Calvinus is strong in friends, and is farther supported\r\nby his very popular exhibition of gladiators; Memmius finds favour with\r\nCæsar's veterans and relies on Pompey's client towns in Gaul. If this\r\ndoes not avail him, people think that some tribune will be found to push\r\noff the elections till Cæsar comes back, especially since Cato has been\r\nacquitted.\r\n\r\nI have answered your letter brought by Paccius: now for the rest. From\r\nmy brother's letter I gather surprising indications of Cæsar's affection\r\nfor me, and they have been confirmed by a very cordial letter from Cæsar\r\nhimself. The result of the British war is a source of anxiety. For it is\r\nascertained that the approaches to the island are protected by\r\nastonishing masses of cliff. Moreover, it is now known that there isn't\r\na pennyweight of silver in that island, nor any hope of booty except\r\nfrom slaves, among whom I don't suppose you can expect any instructed\r\nin literature or music.\r\n\r\nPaullus has almost brought his basilica in the forum to the roof, using\r\nthe same columns as were in the ancient building: the part for which he\r\ngave out a contract he is building on the most magnificent scale.[605]\r\nNeed I say more? Nothing could be more gratifying or more to his glory\r\nthan such a monument. Accordingly, the friends of Cæsar--I mean myself\r\nand Oppius, though you burst with anger--have thought nothing of 60,000\r\nsestertia (about £480,000) for that monument, which you used to speak of\r\nin such high terms, in order to enlarge the forum and extend it right up\r\nto the Hall of Liberty. The claims of private owners could not be\r\nsatisfied for less. We will make it a most glorious affair. For in the\r\nCampus Martius we are about to erect voting places for the _comitia\r\ntributa_, of marble and covered, and to surround them with a lofty\r\ncolonnade a mile in circumference: at the same time the _Villa Publica_\r\nwill also be connected with these erections.[606] You will say: \"What\r\ngood will this monument do me?\" But why should I trouble myself about\r\nthat? I have told you all the news at Rome: for I don't suppose you want\r\nto know about the lustrum, of which there is now no hope,[607] or about\r\nthe trials which are being held under the (Cincian) law.[608]\r\n\r\nNow allow yourself to be scolded, if you deserve it. For you say in the\r\nletter from Buthrotum, delivered to me by C. Decimus, that you think you\r\nwill have to go to Asia. There did not, by Hercules, seem to me to be\r\nanything that made it matter in the least whether you did the business\r\nby agents or in person; or anything to make you go so often and so far\r\nfrom your friends. But I could have wished that I had urged this on you\r\nbefore you had taken any step. For I certainly should have had some\r\ninfluence on you. As things are, I will suppress the rest of my\r\nscolding. May it only have some effect in hastening your return! The\r\nreason of my not writing oftener to you is the uncertainty I am in as to\r\nwhere you are or are going to be. However, I thought I ought to give\r\nthis letter to a chance messenger, because he seemed to be likely to see\r\nyou. Since you think you really will go to Asia, pray tell me by what\r\ntime we may expect you back, and what you have done about Eutychides.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 600: That is, as an interlocutor in the dialogue \"On the\r\nRepublic,\" which Cicero was engaged in writing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 601: A law re-enacting the _lex Didia_, and enacting under\r\npenalties that no law was to be brought forward without due publication\r\nbeforehand.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 602: A law which enabled the magistrates and tribunes to stop\r\nlegislation by _obnuntiatio_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 603: Procilius had been condemned _de vi_ (p. 280). The\r\nrumours, I suppose, were as to the jury having been corrupted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 604: The consul L. Domitius Ahenobarbus and C. Lucceius\r\nHirrus, the latter a warm partisan of Pompey, who was supposed to be\r\nagitating for a dictatorship.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 605: L. Æmilius Paullus (consul B.C. 50) restored the basilica\r\nbuilt by his ancestor M.

They were partly carried out by\r\nCæsar but not completed till the time of Augustus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 607: Because the tribunes stopped it--the formal act at the\r\nend of the Censor's office--by _obnuntiationes_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 608: The name of the law mentioned here is uncertain. The _lex\r\nCincia de munuibus_ forbade advocates taking fees for pleading.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXLIII (A IV, 15)\r\n\r\nTO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)\r\n\r\nROME, 27 JULY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nI am glad about Eutychides, who, using your old _prænomen_ and your new\r\n_nomen_, will be called Titus Cæcilius, just as Dionysius, from a\r\ncombination of your names and mine, is Marcus Pomponius. I am, by\r\nHercules, exceedingly gratified that Eutychides has had cause to know\r\nyour kindness to me, and that the sympathy he shewed me in the time of\r\nmy sorrow was neither unnoticed at the time nor afterwards forgotten by\r\nme. I suppose you were obliged to undertake your journey to Asia. For\r\nyou never would have been willing, without the most urgent cause, to be\r\nso far from so many persons and things which you love so much, and which\r\ngive you so much delight. But the speed of your return will shew your\r\nkindness and love for your friends. Yet I fear lest the rhetorician\r\nClodius, by his charms, and Pituanius, that excellent scholar, as he is\r\nsaid to be, and now, indeed, so wholly devoted to Greek letters, may\r\ndetain you. But if you would shew the feelings of a man, come back to us\r\nat the time you promised. You will, after all, be able to enjoy their\r\nsociety at Rome, when they get there safe. You say you desire something\r\nin the way of a letter from me: I have written, and, indeed, on many\r\nsubjects--everything detailed like a journal--but, as I conjecture from\r\nyour not having, as it seems, remained long in Epirus, I suppose it has\r\nnot reached you. Moreover, my letters to _you_ are generally of such a\r\nkind, that I don't like to put them in anyone's hands, unless I can feel\r\ncertain that he will deliver them to you.\r\n\r\nNow for affairs at Rome. On the 4th of July Sufenas and Cato were\r\nacquitted, Procilius condemned. From which we have learnt that our\r\ntreble-distilled Areopagites care not a rush for bribery, elections,\r\n_interregnum, lèse majesté_, or, in fact, for the state generally; but\r\nthat they would rather that a father of a family were not murdered on\r\nhis own hearth-stone--and even that preference not very decided. There\r\nwere twenty-two votes for acquittal, twenty-nine for condemnation![609]\r\nPublius, no doubt by an eloquent peroration in his speech for the\r\nprosecution, had quickened the feelings of the jurors! Herbalus[610] was\r\nin the case, and behaved as usual. I said never a word. For my little\r\ngirl, who is unwell, was afraid of offending Publius's feelings. After\r\nthis was over the people of Reate conducted me to their Temple, to plead\r\ntheir cause against the people of Interamna before the consul and ten\r\ncommissioners, because the Veline Lake, which had been drained by Manius\r\nCurius by cutting away the mountain, flowed into the Nar, by which means\r\nthe famous Rosia has been reclaimed from the swamp, though still fairly\r\nmoist.[611] I lived with Axius, who took me also to visit Seven Waters.\r\nI returned to Rome on the 9th of July for the sake of Fonteius. I\r\nentered the theatre. At first I was greeted with loud and general\r\napplause--but don't take any notice of that, I was a fool to mention\r\nit--then I turned my attention to Antiphon. He had been manumitted\r\nbefore being brought on to the stage. Not to keep you in suspense, he\r\nbore away the palm. But there never was anything so dwarfish, so\r\ndestitute of voice, so---- But keep this to yourself. However, in the\r\n_Andromache_ he was just taller than Astyanax: among the rest he had not\r\none of his own height. You next ask about Arbuscula: she had a great\r\nsuccess. The games were splendid and much liked. The wild-beast hunt was\r\nput off to a future occasion. Next follow me into the _campus_. Bribery\r\nis raging: \"and I a sign to you will tell.\"[612] The rate of interest\r\nfrom being four percent, on the 15th of July has gone up to eight\r\npercent. You will say, \"Well, _I_ don't mind that.\"[613] What a man!\r\nWhat a citizen! Memmius is supported by all Cæsar's influence. The\r\nconsuls have formed a coalition between him and Domitius (Calvinus) on\r\nterms which I dare not commit to paper. Pompey rages, remonstrates,\r\nbacks Scaurus, but whether only ostensibly or from the heart people\r\ndon't feel sure. No one takes the lead: money reduces all to the same\r\nlevel. Messalla's chance is at a low ebb: not because he is wanting in\r\nspirit or friends, but because this coalition of the consuls, as well as\r\nPompey's opposition, stands in his way. I think the result will be a\r\npostponement of the elections. The tribunician candidates have taken an\r\noath to conduct their canvass according to the direction of Cato. They\r\nhave deposited with him 500 sestertia apiece, on condition that whoever\r\nCato condemns should forfeit it, and that it should be paid over to his\r\ncompetitors. I write this the day before the elections are to take\r\nplace. But on the 28th of July, if they have taken place, and if the\r\nletter-carrier has not started, I will write you an account of the whole\r\n_comitia_: and, if they are conducted without corruption, Cato by\r\nhimself will have been more efficacious than all laws and jurors put\r\ntogether. I have undertaken to defend Messius, who has been recalled\r\nfrom his legation: for Appius had named him _legatus_ to Cæsar.\r\nServilius ordered his attendance in an edict. His jurors are to be from\r\nthe tribes Pomptina, Velina, and Mæcia. It is a sharp fight: however, it\r\nis going fairly well. After that I have to prepare myself for Drusus,\r\nthen for Scaurus. Very high-sounding title-slips are being prepared for\r\nmy speeches! Perhaps even the consuls-designate will be added to the\r\nlist of my clients: and if Scaurus is not one of them, he will find\r\nhimself in serious difficulties in this trial. Judging from my brother\r\nQuintus's letter, I suspect that by this time he is in Britain. I await\r\nnews of him with anxiety. We have certainly gained one advantage--many\r\nunmistakable indications enable us to feel sure that we are in the\r\nhighest degree liked and valued by Cæsar. Please give my compliments to\r\nDionysius, and beg and exhort him to come as soon as possible, that he\r\nmay continue the instruction of my son and of myself as well.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 609: M.

As you were\r\nnot with my brother Quintus I did not know where to send a letter, or to\r\nwhom to give it. I am anxious to know how you are and where you mean to\r\nwinter. For my part, my opinion is that you should do so with Cæsar; but\r\nI have not ventured to write to him owing to his mourning.[614] I would\r\nrather you put off your return to us, so long as you come with fuller\r\npockets. There is nothing to make you hurry home, especially since\r\n\"Battara\"[615] is dead. But you are quite capable of thinking for\r\nyourself. I desire to know what you have settled. There is a certain Cn.\r\nOctavius or Cn. Cornelius, a friend of yours,\r\n\r\n    \"Of highest race begot, a son of Earth.\"\r\n\r\nHe has frequently asked me to dinner, because he knows that you are an\r\nintimate friend of mine. At present he has not succeeded in getting me:\r\nhowever, I am much obliged to him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 614: For the death (in September) of his daughter Iulia, wife\r\nof Pompey.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 615: A nickname, it is said, of Vacerra (perhaps because he\r\nstuttered), who had been a teacher of Trebatius.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXLV (F VII, 17)\r\n\r\nTO C. TREBATIUS TESTA (IN GAUL)\r\n\r\nROME (SEPTEMBER)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nFrom what I gather from your letter I have thanked my brother Quintus,\r\nand can besides at last heartily commend you, because you at length seem\r\nto have come to some fixed resolution. For I was much put out by your\r\nletters in the first months of your absence, because at times you seemed\r\nto me--pardon the expression--to be light-minded in your longing for the\r\ncity and city life, at others timid in undertaking military work, and\r\noften even a little inclined to presumption--a thing as unlike your\r\nusual self as can be. For, as though you had brought a bill of exchange,\r\nand not a letter of recommendation to your commander-in-chief, you were\r\nall in a hurry to get your money and return home; and it never occurred\r\nto you that those who went to Alexandria[616] with real bills of\r\nexchange have as yet not been able to get a farthing. If I looked only\r\nto my own interests, I should wish, above all things, to have you with\r\nme: for I used to find not only pleasure of no ordinary kind in your\r\nsociety, but also much advantage from your advice and active assistance.\r\nBut since from your earliest manhood you had devoted yourself to my\r\nfriendship and protection, I thought it my duty not only to see that you\r\ncame to no harm, but to advance your fortunes and secure your promotion.\r\nAccordingly, as long as I thought I should be going abroad to a\r\nprovince, I am sure you remember the voluntary offers I made you. After\r\nthat plan had been changed, perceiving that I was being treated by Cæsar\r\nwith the highest consideration, and was regarded by him with unusual\r\naffection, and knowing as I did his incredible liberality and\r\nunsurpassed loyalty to his word, I recommended you to him in the\r\nweightiest and most earnest words at my command. And he accepted this\r\nrecommendation in a gratifying manner, and repeatedly indicated to me in\r\nwriting, and shewed you by word and deed, that he had been powerfully\r\naffected by my recommendation. Having got such a man as your patron, if\r\nyou believe me to have any insight, or to be your well-wisher, do not\r\nlet him go; and if by chance something at times has annoyed you, when\r\nfrom being busy or in difficulties he has seemed to you somewhat slow to\r\nserve you, hold on and wait for the end, which I guarantee will be\r\ngratifying and honourable to you. I need not exhort you at any greater\r\nlength: I only give you this warning, that you will never find a better\r\nopportunity, if you let this slip, either of securing the friendship of\r\na most illustrious and liberal man, or of enjoying a wealthier province\r\nor a more suitable time of life. \"Quintus Cornelius concurred,\" as you\r\nsay in your law books. I am glad you didn't go to Britain, because you\r\nhave been saved some hard work, and I the necessity of listening to your\r\nstories about that expedition. Pray write to me at full length as to\r\nwhere you are going to winter, and what your hopes and present position\r\nare.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 616: To Ptolemy Auletes, who had agreed to pay large sums to\r\ncertain persons for supporting his interests in the senate.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXLVI (Q FR II, 15)\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN BRITAIN)\r\n\r\nROME (SEPTEMBER)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nWhen you receive a letter from me by the hand of an amanuensis, you may\r\nbe sure that I have not even a little leisure; when by my own--a little.\r\nFor let me tell you that in regard to causes and trials in court, I have\r\nnever been closer tied, and that, too, at the most unhealthy season of\r\nthe year, and in the most oppressively hot weather. But these things,\r\nsince you so direct me, I must put up with, and must not seem to have\r\ncome short of the ideas and expectations which you and Cæsar entertain\r\nof me, especially since, even if it were somewhat difficult not to do\r\nthat, I am yet likely from this labour to reap great popularity and\r\nprestige. Accordingly, as you wish me to do, I take great pains not to\r\nhurt anyone's feelings, and to secure being liked even by those very men\r\nwho are vexed at my close friendship with Cæsar, while by those who are\r\nimpartial, or even inclined to this side, I may be warmly courted and\r\nloved. When some very violent debates took place in the senate on the\r\nsubject of bribery for several days, because the candidates for the\r\nconsulship had gone to such lengths as to be past all bearing, I was not\r\nin the house. I have made up my mind not to attempt any cure of the\r\npolitical situation without powerful protection. The day I write this\r\nDrusus has been acquitted on a charge of collusion by the _tribuni\r\nærarii_, in the grand total by four votes, for the majority of senators\r\nand equites were for condemnation. On the same day I am to defend\r\nVatinius. That is an easy matter. The _comitia_ have been put off to\r\nSeptember. Scaurus's trial will take place immediately, and I shall not\r\nfail to appear for him. I don't like your \"Sophoclean Banqueters\" at\r\nall, though I see that you played your part with a good grace.[617] I\r\ncome now to a subject which, perhaps, ought to have been my first. How\r\nglad I was to get your letter from Britain! I was afraid of the ocean,\r\nafraid of the coast of the island. The other parts of the enterprise I\r\ndo not underrate; but yet they inspire more hope than fear, and it is\r\nthe suspense rather than any positive alarm that renders me uneasy. You,\r\nhowever, I can see, have a splendid subject for description, topography,\r\nnatural features of things and places, manners, races, battles, your\r\ncommander himself--what themes for your pen! I will gladly, as you\r\nrequest, assist you in the points you mention, and will send you the\r\nverses you ask for, that is, \"An owl to Athens.\"[618] But, look you! I\r\nthink you are keeping me in the dark. Tell me, my dear brother, what\r\nCæsar thinks of my verses. For he wrote before to tell me he had read my\r\nfirst book. Of the first part, he said that he had never read anything\r\nbetter even in Greek: the rest, up to a particular passage, somewhat\r\n\"careless\"[619]--that is his word. Tell me the truth--is it the\r\nsubject-matter or the \"style\" that he does not like? You needn't be\r\nafraid: I shall not admire myself one whit the less. On this subject\r\nspeak like a lover of truth, and with your usual brotherly frankness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 617: In the \"Banqueters\" (σύνδειπνοι) of Sophocles, Achilles\r\nis excluded from a banquet in Tenedos.

Everything is right with\r\nHerus. In your Manilian property I came across Diphilus outdoing himself\r\nin dilatoriness. Still, he had nothing left to construct, except baths,\r\nand a promenade, and an aviary. I liked that villa very much, because\r\nits paved colonnade[621] gives it an air of very great dignity. I never\r\nappreciated this till now that the colonnade itself has been all laid\r\nopen, and the columns have been polished. It all depends--and this I\r\nwill look to--upon the stuccoing being prettily done. The pavements\r\nseemed to be being well laid. Certain of the ceilings I did not like,\r\nand ordered them to be changed. As to the place in which they say that\r\nyou write word that a small entrance hall is to be built--namely, in the\r\ncolonnade--I liked it better as it is. For I did not think there was\r\nspace sufficient for an entrance hall; nor is it usual to have one,\r\nexcept in those buildings which have a larger court; nor could it have\r\nbedrooms and apartments of that kind attached to it. As it is, from the\r\nvery beauty of its arched roof, it will serve as an admirable summer\r\nroom. However, if you think differently, write back word as soon as\r\npossible. In the bath I have moved the hot chamber to the other corner\r\nof the dressing-room, because it was so placed that its steampipe was\r\nimmediately under the bedrooms. A fair-sized bedroom and a lofty winter\r\none I admired very much, for they were both spacious and\r\nwell-situated--on the side of the promenade nearest to the bath.\r\nDiphilus had placed the columns out of the perpendicular, and not\r\nopposite each other. These, of course, he shall take down; he will learn\r\nsome day to use the plumb-line and measure. On the whole, I hope\r\nDiphilus's work will be completed in a few months: for Cæsius, who was\r\nwith me at the time, keeps a very sharp look-out upon him.\r\n\r\nThence I started straight along the _via Vitularia_ to your Fufidianum,\r\nthe estate which we bought for you a few weeks ago at Arpinum for\r\n100,000 sesterces (about £800). I never saw a shadier spot in\r\nsummer--water springs in many parts of it, and abundant into the\r\nbargain. In short, Cæsius thought that you would easily irrigate fifty\r\n_iugera_ of the meadow land. For my part, I can assure you of this,\r\nwhich is more in my line, that you will have a villa marvellously\r\npleasant, with the addition of a fish-pond, spouting fountains, a\r\n_palæstra_, and a shrubbery. I am told that you wish to keep this\r\nBovillæ estate. You will determine as you think good. Calvus said that,\r\neven if the control of the water were taken from you, and the right of\r\ndrawing it off were established by the vendor, and thus an easement were\r\nimposed on that property, we could yet maintain the price in case we\r\nwished to sell. He said that he had agreed with you to do the work at\r\nthree sesterces a foot, and that he had stepped it, and made it three\r\nmiles. It seemed to me more. But I will guarantee that the money could\r\nnowhere be better laid out. I had sent for Cillo from Venafrum, but on\r\nthat very day four of his fellow servants and apprentices had been\r\ncrushed by the falling in of a tunnel at Venafrum. On the 13th of\r\nSeptember I was at Laterium. I examined the road, which appeared to me\r\nto be so good as to seem almost like a high road, except a hundred and\r\nfifty paces--for I measured it myself from the little bridge at the\r\ntemple of Furina, in the direction of Satricum. There they had put down\r\ndust, not gravel (this shall be changed), and that part of the road is a\r\nvery steep incline. But I understood that it could not be taken in any\r\nother direction, particularly as you did not wish it to go through the\r\nproperty of Locusta or Varro. The latter alone had made the road very\r\nwell where it skirted his own property. Locusta hadn't touched it; but I\r\nwill call on him at Rome, and think I shall be able to stir him up, and\r\nat the same time I shall ask M. Taurus, who is now at Rome, and whom I\r\nam told promised to allow you to do so, about making a watercourse\r\nthrough his property. I much approved of your steward Nicephorius, and I\r\nasked him what orders you had given about that small building at\r\nLaterium, about which you spoke to me. He told me in answer that he had\r\nhimself contracted to do the work for sixteen sestertia (about £128),\r\nbut that you had afterwards made many additions to the work, but nothing\r\nto the price, and that he had therefore given it up. I quite approve, by\r\nHercules, of your making the additions you had determined upon; although\r\nthe villa as it stands seems to have the air of a philosopher, meant to\r\nrebuke the extravagance of other villas. Yet, after all, that addition\r\nwill be pleasing. I praised your landscape gardener: he has so covered\r\neverything with ivy, both the foundation-wall of the villa and the\r\nspaces between the columns of the walk, that, upon my word, those Greek\r\nstatues seemed to be engaged in fancy gardening, and to be shewing off\r\nthe ivy. Finally, nothing can be cooler or more mossy than the\r\ndressing-room of the bath. That is about all I have to say about country\r\nmatters. The gardener, indeed, as well as Philotimus and Cincius are\r\npressing on the ornamentation of your town house; but I also often look\r\nin upon it myself, as I can do without difficulty. Wherefore don't be at\r\nall anxious about that.\r\n\r\nAs to your always asking me about your son, of course I \"excuse you\";\r\nbut I must ask you to \"excuse\" me also, for I don't allow that you love\r\nhim more than I do. And oh that he had been with me these last few days\r\nat Arpinum, as he had himself set his heart on being, and as I had no\r\nless done! As to Pomponia, please write and say that, when I go out of\r\ntown anywhere, she is to come with me and bring the boy. I'll do wonders\r\nwith him, if I get him to myself when I am at leisure: for at Rome there\r\nis no time to breathe. You know I formerly promised to do so for\r\nnothing. What do you expect with such a reward as you promise me? I now\r\ncome to your letters which I received in several packets when I was at\r\nArpinum. For I received three from you in one day, and, indeed, as it\r\nseemed, despatched by you at the same time--one of considerable length,\r\nin which your first point was that my letter to you was dated earlier\r\nthan that to Cæsar. Oppius at times cannot help this: the reason is\r\nthat, having settled to send letter-carriers, and having received a\r\nletter from me, he is hindered by something turning up, and obliged to\r\ndespatch them later than he had intended; and I don't take the trouble\r\nto have the day altered on a letter which I have once handed to him. You\r\nwrite about Cæsar's extreme affection for us. This affection you must on\r\nyour part keep warm, and I for mine will endeavour to increase it by\r\nevery means in my power. About Pompey, I am carefully acting, and shall\r\ncontinue to act, as you advise. That my permission to you to stay longer\r\nis a welcome one, though I grieve at your absence and miss you\r\nexceedingly, I am yet partly glad. What you can be thinking of in\r\nsending for such people as Hippodamus and some others, I do not\r\nunderstand. There is not one of those fellows that won't expect a\r\npresent from you equal to a suburban estate. However, there is no reason\r\nfor your classing my friend Trebatius with them. I sent him to Cæsar,\r\nand Cæsar has done all I expected. If he has not done quite what _he_\r\nexpected himself, I am not bound to make it up to him, and I in like\r\nmanner free and absolve you from all claims on his part. Your remark,\r\nthat you are a greater favourite with Cæsar every day, is a source of\r\nundying satisfaction to me. As to Balbus, who, as you say, promotes that\r\nstate of things, he is the apple of my eye. I am indeed glad that you\r\nand my friend Trebonius like each other. As to what you say about the\r\nmilitary tribuneship, I, indeed, asked for it definitely for Curtius,\r\nand Cæsar wrote back definitely to say that there was one at Curtius's\r\nservice, and chided me for my modesty in making the request. If I have\r\nasked one for anyone else--as I told Oppius to write and tell Cæsar--I\r\nshall not be at all annoyed by a refusal, since those who pester me for\r\nletters _are_ annoyed at a refusal from me. I like Curtius, as I have\r\ntold him, not only because you asked me to do so, but from the\r\ncharacter you gave of him; for from your letter I have gathered the zeal\r\nhe shewed for my restoration. As for the British expedition, I conclude\r\nfrom your letter that we have no occasion either for fear or exultation.\r\nAs to public affairs, about which you wish Tiro to write to you, I have\r\nwritten to you hitherto somewhat more carelessly than usual, because I\r\nknew that all events, small or great, were reported to Cæsar. I have now\r\nanswered your longest letter.\r\n\r\nNow hear what I have to say to your small one. The first point is about\r\nClodius's letter to Cæsar. In that matter I approve of Cæsar's policy,\r\nin not having given way to your request so far as to write a single word\r\nto that Fury. The next thing is about the speech of Calventius\r\n\"Marius.\"[622] I am surprised at your saying that you think I ought to\r\nanswer it, particularly as, while no one is likely to read that speech,\r\nunless I write an answer to it, every schoolboy learns mine against him\r\nas an exercise. My books, all of which you are expecting, I have begun,\r\nbut I cannot finish them for some days yet. The speeches for Scaurus and\r\nPlancius which you clamour for I have finished. The poem to Cæsar, which\r\nI had begun, I have cut short. I will write what you ask me for, since\r\nyour poetic springs are running dry, as soon as I have time.\r\n\r\nNow for the third letter. It is very pleasant and welcome news to hear\r\nfrom you that Balbus is soon coming to Rome, and so well\r\naccompanied![623] and will stay with me continuously till the 15th of\r\nMay. As to your exhorting me in the same letter, as in many previous\r\nones, to ambition and labour, I shall, of course, do as you say: but\r\nwhen am I to enjoy any real life?\r\n\r\nYour fourth letter reached me on the 13th of September, dated on the\r\n10th of August from Britain. In it there was nothing new except about\r\nyour _Erigona_, and if I get that from Oppius I will write and tell you\r\nwhat I think of it. I have no doubt I shall like it.[624] Oh yes! I had\r\nalmost forgotten to remark as to the man who, you say in your letter,\r\nhad written to Cæsar about the applause given to Milo--I am not\r\nunwilling that Cæsar should think that it was as warm as possible. And\r\nin point of fact it was so, and yet that applause, which is given to\r\nhim, seems in a certain sense to be given to me.[625]\r\n\r\nI have also received a very old letter, but which was late in coming\r\ninto my hands, in which you remind me about the temple of Tellus and the\r\ncolonnade of Catulus. Both of these matters are being actively carried\r\nout. At the temple of Tellus I have even got your statue placed. So,\r\nagain, as to your reminder about a suburban villa and gardens, I was\r\nnever very keen for one, and now my town house has all the charm of such\r\na pleasure-ground. On my arrival in Rome on the 18th of September I\r\nfound the roof on your house finished: the part over the sitting-rooms,\r\nwhich you did not wish to have many gables, now slopes gracefully\r\ntowards the roof of the lower colonnade. Our boy, in my absence, did not\r\ncease working with his rhetoric master. You have no reason for being\r\nanxious about his education, for you know his ability, and I see his\r\napplication. Everything else I take it upon myself to guarantee, with\r\nfull consciousness that I am bound to make it good.\r\n\r\nAs yet there are three parties prosecuting Gabinius: first, L. Lentulus,\r\nson of the _flamen_, who has entered a prosecution for _lèse\r\nmajesté_;[626] secondly, Tib. Nero, with good names at the back of his\r\nindictment; thirdly, C. Memmius the tribune in conjunction with L.\r\nCapito. He came to the walls of the city on the 19th of September,\r\nundignified and neglected to the last degree. But in the present state\r\nof the law courts I do not venture to be confident of anything. As Cato\r\nis unwell, he has not yet been formally indicted for extortion. Pompey\r\nis trying hard to persuade me to be reconciled to him, but as yet he has\r\nnot succeeded at all, nor, if I retain a shred of liberty, will he\r\nsucceed. I am very anxious for a letter from you. You say that you have\r\nbeen told that I was a party to the coalition of the consular\r\ncandidates--it is a lie. The compacts made in that coalition, afterwards\r\nmade public by Memmius, were of such a nature that no loyal man ought to\r\nhave been a party to them;[627] nor at the same time was it possible for\r\nme to be a party to a coalition from which Messalla was excluded, who is\r\nthoroughly satisfied with my conduct in every particular, as also, I\r\nthink, is Memmius. To Domitius himself I have rendered many services,\r\nwhich he desired and asked of me. I have put Scaurus under a heavy\r\nobligation by my defence of him. It is as yet very uncertain both when\r\nthe elections will be and who will be consuls.\r\n\r\nJust as I was folding up this epistle letter-carriers arrived from you\r\nand Cæsar (20th September) after a journey of twenty days. How anxious I\r\nwas! How painfully I was affected by Cæsar's most kind letter![628] But\r\nthe kinder it was, the more sorrow did his loss occasion me. But to turn\r\nto your letter. To begin with, I reiterate my approval of your staying\r\non, especially as, according to your account, you have consulted Cæsar\r\non the subject. I wonder that Oppius has anything to do with Publius,\r\nfor I advised against it. Farther on in your letter you say that I am\r\ngoing to be made _legatus_ to Pompey on the 13th of September: I have\r\nheard nothing about it, and I wrote to Cæsar to tell him that neither\r\nVibullius nor Oppius had delivered his message to Pompey about my\r\nremaining at home. Why, I know not. However, it was I who restrained\r\nOppius from doing so, because it was Vibullius who should take the\r\nleading part in that matter: for with him Cæsar had communicated\r\npersonally, with Oppius only by letter. I indeed can have no \"second\r\nthoughts\"[629] in matters connected with Cæsar. He comes next after you\r\nand our children in my regard, and not much after. I think I act in this\r\nwith deliberate judgment, for I have by this time good cause for it,\r\nyet warm personal feeling no doubt does influence me also.\r\n\r\nJust as I had written these last words--which are by my own hand--your\r\nboy came in to dine with me, as Pomponia was dining out. He gave me your\r\nletter to read, which he had received shortly before--a truly\r\nAristophanic mixture of jest and earnest, with which I was greatly\r\ncharmed.[630] He gave me also your second letter, in which you bid him\r\ncling to my side as a mentor. How delighted he was with those letters!\r\nAnd so was I. Nothing could be more attractive than that boy, nothing\r\nmore affectionate to me!--This, to explain its being in another\r\nhandwriting, I dictated to Tiro while at dinner.\r\n\r\nYour letter gratified Annalis very much, as shewing that you took an\r\nactive interest in his concerns, and yet assisted him with exceedingly\r\ncandid advice. Publius Servilius the elder, from a letter which he said\r\nhe had received from Cæsar, declares himself highly obliged to you for\r\nhaving spoken with the greatest kindness and earnestness of his devotion\r\nto Cæsar. After my return to Rome from Arpinum I was told that\r\nHippodamus had started to join you. I cannot say that I was surprised at\r\nhis having acted so discourteously as to start to join you without a\r\nletter from me: I only say this, that I was annoyed. For I had long\r\nresolved, from an expression in your letter, that if I had anything I\r\nwished conveyed to you with more than usual care, I should give it to\r\nhim: for, in truth, into a letter like this, which I send you in an\r\nordinary way, I usually put nothing that, if it fell into certain hands,\r\nmight be a source of annoyance. I reserve myself for Minucius and\r\nSalvius and Labeo. Labeo will either be starting late or will stay here\r\naltogether. Hippodamus did not even ask me whether he could do anything\r\nfor me. T. Penarius sends me a kind letter about you: says that he is\r\nexceedingly charmed with your literary pursuits, conversation, and above\r\nall by your dinners. He was always a favourite of mine, and I see a good\r\ndeal of his brother. Wherefore continue, as you have begun, to admit the\r\nyoung man to your intimacy.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact of this letter having been in hand during many days, owing\r\nto the delay of the letter-carriers, I have jotted down in it many\r\nvarious things at odd times, as, for instance, the following. Titus\r\nAnicius has mentioned to me more than once that he would not hesitate to\r\nbuy a suburban property for you, if he found one. In these remarks of\r\nhis I find two things surprising: first, that when you write to him\r\nabout buying a suburban property, you not only don't write to me to that\r\neffect, but write even in a contrary sense; and, secondly, that in\r\nwriting to him you totally forget his letters which you shewed me at\r\nTusculum, and as totally the rule of Epicharmus, \"Notice how he has\r\ntreated another\":[631] in fact, that you have quite forgotten, as I\r\nthink, the lesson conveyed by the expression of his face, his\r\nconversation, and his spirit. But this is your concern. As to a suburban\r\nproperty, be sure to let me know your wishes, and at the same time take\r\ncare that that fellow doesn't get you into trouble. What else have I to\r\nsay? Anything? Yes, there is this: Gabinius entered the city by night on\r\nthe 27th of September, and to-day, at two o'clock, when he ought to have\r\nappeared on his trial for _lèse majesté_, in accordance with the edict\r\nof C. Alfius, he was all but crushed to the earth by a great and\r\nunanimous demonstration of the popular hatred. Nothing could exceed his\r\nhumiliating position. However, Piso comes next to him. So I think of\r\nintroducing a marvellous episode into my second book[632]--Apollo\r\ndeclaring in the council of the gods what sort of return that of the two\r\ncommanders was to be, one of whom had lost, and the other sold his army.\r\nFrom Britain I have a letter of Cæsar's dated the 1st of September,\r\nwhich reached me on the 27th, satisfactory enough as far as the British\r\nexpedition is concerned, in which, to prevent my wondering at not\r\ngetting one from you, he tells me that you were not with him when he\r\nreached the coast. To that letter I made no reply, not even a formal\r\ncongratulation, on account of his mourning. Many, many wishes, dear\r\nbrother, for your health.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 620: That is, to get them seats at the games. See Letter XXVI,\r\np. 63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 621: The _porticus_ is a kind of cloister round the\r\n_peristylium_ or _atrium_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 622: Calventius is said to stand for L. Calpurnius Piso\r\nCæsoninus, the consul of B.C. 58, against whom Cicero's speech was\r\nspoken in B.C. 55 in the senate. He calls him Calventius from his\r\nmaternal grandfather, and Marius because--as he had said, in the speech,\r\n§ 20--he had himself gone into exile rather than come to open fight with\r\nhim; just as Q. Metellus had done in B.C. 100, when, declining to take\r\nthe oath to the agrarian law of Saturninus, rather than fight Marius,\r\nwho had taken the oath, he went into exile. This seems rather a\r\nroundabout explanation; but no better has been proposed, and, of course,\r\nQuintus, who had lately read the speech, would be able better to\r\nunderstand the allusion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 623: _I.e._, with money.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 624: This tragedy of Quintus's never reached Cicero.

For my\r\nletters are not of the sort to make their non-delivery a matter of\r\nindifference; they contain so many confidential secrets that I do not as\r\na rule trust them even to an amanuensis, for fear of some jest leaking\r\nout in some direction or another.\r\n\r\nThe consuls are in a blaze of infamy because Gaius Memmius, one of the\r\ncandidates, read out in the senate a compact which he and his fellow\r\ncandidate, Domitius Calvinus, had made with the consuls--that both were\r\nto forfeit to the consuls 40 sestertia apiece (in case they were\r\nthemselves elected consuls), if they did not produce three augurs to\r\ndepose that they had been present at the passing of a _lex curiata_,\r\nwhich, in fact, had not been passed; and two consulars to depose to\r\nhaving helped to draft a decree for furnishing the consular provinces,\r\nthough there had not even been a meeting of the senate at all.[633] As\r\nthis compact was alleged not to have been a mere verbal one, but to\r\nhave been drawn up with the sums to be paid duly entered, formal orders\r\nfor payment, and written attestations of many persons, it was, on the\r\nsuggestion of Pompey, produced by Memmius, but with the names\r\nobliterated. It has made no difference to Appius--he had no character to\r\nlose! To the other consul it was a real knock-down blow, and he is, I\r\nassure you, a ruined man. Memmius, however, having thus dissolved the\r\ncoalition, has lost all chance of election, and is by this time in a\r\nworse position than ever, because we are now informed that his\r\nrevelation is strongly disapproved of by Cæsar. Our friend Messalla and\r\nhis fellow candidate, Domitius Calvinus, have been very liberal to the\r\npeople. Nothing can exceed their popularity. They are certain to be\r\nconsuls. But the senate has passed a decree that a \"trial with closed\r\ndoors\" should be held before the elections in respect to each of the\r\ncandidates severally by the panels already allotted to them all. The\r\ncandidates are in a great fright. But certain jurors--among them\r\nOpimius, Veiento, and Rantius--appealed to the tribunes to prevent their\r\nbeing called upon to act as jurors without an order of the people[634].\r\nThe business goes on. The _comitia_ are postponed by a decree of the\r\nsenate till such time as the law for the \"trial with closed doors\" is\r\ncarried. The day for passing the law arrived. Terentius vetoed it. The\r\nconsuls, having all along conducted this business in a half-hearted kind\r\nof way, referred the matter back to the senate. Hereupon--Bedlam! my\r\nvoice being heard with the rest. \"Aren't you wise enough to keep quiet,\r\nafter all?\" you will say. Forgive me: I can hardly restrain myself. But,\r\nnevertheless, was there ever such a farce? The senate had voted that the\r\nelections should not be held till the law was passed: that, in case of a\r\ntribunician veto, the whole question should be referred to them afresh.\r\nThe law is introduced in a perfunctory manner: is vetoed, to the great\r\nrelief of the proposers: the matter is referred to the senate. Upon that\r\nthe senate voted that it was for the interest of the state that the\r\nelections should be held at the earliest possible time!\r\n\r\nScaurus, who had been acquitted a few days before,[635] after a most\r\nelaborate speech from me on his behalf--when all the days up to the 29th\r\nof September (on which I write this) had one after the other been\r\nrendered impossible for the _comitia_ by notices of ill omens put in by\r\nScævola--paid the people what they expected at his own house, tribe by\r\ntribe. But all the same, though his liberality was more generous, it was\r\nnot so acceptable as that of the two mentioned above, who had got the\r\nstart of him. I could have wished to see your face when you read\r\nthis;[636] for I am certain you entertain some hope that these\r\ntransactions will occupy a great many weeks! But there is to be a\r\nmeeting of the senate to-day, that is, the 1st of October--for day is\r\nalready breaking. There no one will speak his mind except Antius and\r\nFavonius,[637] for Cato is ill. Don't be afraid about me: nevertheless,\r\nI make no promises. Is there anything else you want to know? Anything?\r\nYes, the trials, I think. Drusus and Scaurus[638] are believed not to\r\nhave been guilty. Three candidates are thought likely to be prosecuted:\r\nDomitius Calvinus by Memmius, Messalla by Q. Pompeius Rufus,\r\nScaurus[639] by Triarius or by L. Cæsar. \"What will you be able to say\r\nfor them?\" quoth you. May I die if I know! In those books[640]\r\ncertainly, of which you speak so highly, I find no suggestion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 633: The object of the existing consuls in making such a\r\nbargain was to get to their provinces without difficulty, with\r\n_imperium_, which had to be bestowed by a formal meeting of the old\r\n_comitia curiata_. But that formality could be stopped by tribunes or\r\nother magistrates \"watching the sky,\" or declaring evil omens: and just\r\nas these means were being resorted to to put off the elections, so they\r\nwere also likely to be used in this matter. If it was thus put off into\r\nthe next year, Domitius and Appius, not being any longer consuls, would\r\nhave still greater difficulty. Corrupt as the arrangement was, it seems\r\nnot to have come under any existing law, and both escaped punishment.\r\nAppius went as proconsul to Cilicia, in spite of the _lex curiata_ not\r\nbeing passed, but Domitius Ahenobarbus seems not to have had a province.\r\nThe object of Domitius Calvinus and Memmius in making the compact was to\r\nsecure their own election, which the existing consuls had many means of\r\nassisting, but it is not clear what Memmius's object in disclosing it\r\nwas. Perhaps anger on finding his hopes gone, and an idea that anything\r\nthat humiliated Ahenobarbus would be pleasing to Cæsar. He also seems to\r\nhave quarrelled with Calvinus. Gaius Memmius Gemellus is not to be\r\nconfounded with Gaius Memmius the tribune mentioned in the next letter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 634: There is considerable uncertainty as to the exact nature\r\nof _iudicium tacitum_, here rendered \"a trial with closed doors,\" on the\r\nanalogy of the _senatus consultum tacitum_ described by Capitolinus, _in\r\nGordian_. ch. xii. It is not, I think, mentioned elsewhere (_iudiciis\r\ntacitis_ of 2 _Off._ § 24, is a general expression for \"anonymous\r\nexpressions of opinion\"), and the passage in Plutarch (_Cato min._ 44)\r\nintroduces a new difficulty, for it indicates a court in which\r\ncandidates _after_ election are to purge themselves. Again, _quæ erant\r\nomnibus sortita_ is very difficult. Cicero nowhere else, I believe, uses\r\nthe passive _sortitus_. But, passing that, what are the _consilia_\r\nmeant? The tense and mood shew, I think, that the words are explanatory\r\nby the writer, not part of the decree. I venture, contrary to all\r\neditors, to take _omnibus_ as dative, and to suppose that the _consilia_\r\nmeant are those of the _album iudicum_ who had been selected to try\r\ncases of _ambitus_, of which many were expected. There is no proof that\r\nthe _iudices_ in a _iudicium tacitum_ had to be senators, and the names\r\nin the next sentence point the other way. The senate proposed that the\r\nlaw should allow this selection from the _album_ to form the _iudicium\r\ntacitum_, which would give no public verdict, but on whose report they\r\ncould afterwards act.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 635: M. Æmilius Scaurus was acquitted on the 2nd of September\r\non a charge of extortion in Sardinia. The trial had been hurried on lest\r\nhe should use the Sardinian money in bribing for the consulship. Hence\r\nhe could not begin distributing his gifts to the electors till after\r\nSeptember 2nd, and his rivals Domitius and Messalla got the start of\r\nhim. See Asconius, 131 _seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 636: He means that Atticus--as a lender of money--would be\r\nglad of anything that kept the rate of interest up (see p. 286).

He had a very biting tongue.

On that same day\r\nMemmius[641] gave Gabinius such a splendid warning in public meeting\r\nthat Calidius couldn't say a word for him. To-morrow (which is strictly\r\nthe day after to-morrow, for I am writing before daybreak) there is a\r\ntrial before Cato for the selection of his prosecutor between Memmius,\r\nTiberius Nero, and Gaius and Lucius, sons of M. Antonius. I think the\r\nresult will be in favour of Memmius, though a strong case is being made\r\nout for Nero. In short, he is in a fairly tight fix, unless our friend\r\nPompey, to the disgust of gods and men, upsets the whole concern. Let me\r\ngive you a specimen of the fellow's impudence, and extract _something_\r\namusing from the public disasters. Gabinius having given out wherever he\r\ncame that he was demanding a triumph, and having suddenly, the\r\nexcellent general! invaded the city of his enemies by night,[642] did\r\nnot venture to enter the senate. Meanwhile, exactly on the tenth day, on\r\nwhich he was bound to report the number of the enemy and of his own\r\nsoldiers who had been killed, he slunk into the house, which was very\r\nthinly attended. When he made as if to go out, he was stopped by the\r\nconsuls. The _publicani_ were introduced. The fellow was assailed on\r\nevery side, and my words stinging him more than all, he lost patience,\r\nand in a voice quivering with anger called me \"Exile.\"\r\nThereupon--Heavens! I never had such a compliment paid me in all my\r\nlife!--the senate rose up to a man with a loud shout and made a menacing\r\nmovement in his direction: the _publicani_ made an equal noise and a\r\nsimilar movement. In fine, they all behaved exactly as you would have\r\ndone. It is the leading topic of conversation out of the house. However,\r\nI refrain from prosecuting, with difficulty, by Hercules! yet refrain I\r\ndo: either because I don't want to quarrel with Pompey--the impending\r\nquestion of Milo is enough in that direction--or because we have no\r\njurors worthy of the name. I fear a fiasco: besides, there is the\r\nill-will of certain persons to me, and I am afraid my conducting the\r\nprosecution might give him some advantage: besides, I do not despair of\r\nthe thing being done both without me and yet partly through my\r\nassistance. All the candidates for the consulships have had prosecutions\r\nfor bribery lodged against them: Domitius Calvinus by Memmius (the\r\ntribune), Memmius (the candidate) by Q. Acutius, an excellent young man\r\nand a good lawyer, Messalla by Q. Pompeius, Scaurus by Triarius. The\r\naffair causes great commotion, because it is a plain alternative between\r\nshipwreck for the men concerned or for the laws. Pressure is being\r\napplied to prevent the trials taking place. It looks like an\r\n_interregnum_ again. The consuls desire to hold the _comitia_: the\r\naccused don't wish it, and especially Memmius, because he hopes that\r\nCæsar's approach[643] may secure him the consulship. But he is at a\r\nvery low ebb. Domitius, with Messalla as his colleague, I think is a\r\ncertainty. Scaurus has lost his chance. Appius declares that he will\r\nrelieve Lentulus even without a curiate law,[644] and, indeed, he\r\ndistinguished himself amazingly that day (I almost forgot to mention it)\r\nin an attack upon Gabinius. He accused him of _lèse majesté_, and gave\r\nthe names of his witnesses without Gabinius answering a word. That is\r\nall the public news. At home all is well: your house itself is being\r\nproceeded with by the contractors with fair expedition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 641: C. Memmius, a tribune of this year, not the same as the\r\nC. Memmius Gemellus of the last letter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 642: Referring to the fact that Gabinius, on his arrival\r\noutside Rome, without the usual procession of friends which met a\r\nreturning proconsul, skulked about till nightfall, not venturing to\r\nenter Rome (the city of his enemies!) in daylight. By entering Rome he\r\ngave up his _imperium_ and could no longer ask a triumph.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 643: Cæsar was accustomed to come to North Italy (Gallia\r\nCisalpina) for the winter to Ravenna or Luca, and there he could be\r\ncommunicated with and exercise great influence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 644: That is, he would go to his province of Cilicia on the\r\nstrength of his nomination or allotment by the senate. There was some\r\ndoubt as to the question whether such allotment did not give _imperium_\r\neven without a _lex curiata_. Besides, the consul had already\r\n_imperium_, and he might consider it to be uninterrupted if he left Rome\r\nimmediately. However, as there was always an interval between the end of\r\nthe consulship and the quitting Rome _paludatus_, the _lex curiata_ had\r\ngenerally been considered necessary (Cæs. _B. C._ i. 6). After B.C. 52\r\nthe _lex Pompeia_ enacted a five years' interval, when, of course, a law\r\nwould be necessary.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCL (Q FR III, 3)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL)\r\n\r\nROME (OCTOBER)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nThe writing of an amanuensis must shew you the amount of my engagements.\r\nI assure you that no day passes without my appearing for the defence of\r\nsome one. Accordingly, all composition or reflexion I reserve for the\r\nhour of my walk. So stands my business: matters at home, however, are\r\neverything I could wish. Our boys are well, diligent in their studies,\r\nand affectionate to me and each other. The decoration of both of our\r\nhouses is still in hand: but your rural works at Arcanum and Laterium\r\nare now completed. For the rest, as to the water and the road, I went\r\ninto the case thoroughly, in a certain letter of mine, without omitting\r\nanything. But, in truth, the anxiety which is now giving me great\r\nuneasiness and pain is that for a period of fifty days I have heard\r\nnothing from you or from Cæsar--nothing has found its way from those\r\nparts, either in the shape of a letter, or even of a rumour. Moreover,\r\nboth the sea and land out there make me uneasy, and I never cease\r\nimagining, as one does when one's affections are deeply involved, all\r\nthat I least desire. Wherefore I do not, indeed, for the present ask you\r\nto write me an account of yourself and your doings, for that you never\r\nomit doing when possible, but I wish you to know this--that I have\r\nscarcely ever been so anxious for anything as at the moment of writing I\r\nam for a letter from you. Now for what is going on in politics. One day\r\nafter another for the _comitia_ is struck out by notices of bad omens,\r\nto the great satisfaction of all the loyalists: so great is the scandal\r\nin which the consuls are involved, owing to the suspicion of their\r\nhaving bargained for a bribe from the candidates. The four candidates\r\nfor the consulship are all arraigned: their cases are difficult of\r\ndefence, but I shall do my best to secure the safety of our friend\r\nMessalla--and that is inseparable from the acquittal of the others.\r\nPublius Sulla has accused Gabinius of bribery--his stepson Memmius, his\r\ncousin Cæcilius, and his son Sulla backing the indictment. L. Torquatus\r\nput in his claim to the conduct of the prosecution, and, to everybody's\r\nsatisfaction, failed to establish it. You ask, \"What will become of\r\nGabinius?\" We shall know in three days' time about the charge of _lèse\r\nmajesté_. In that case he is at a disadvantage from the hatred\r\nentertained by all classes for him; witnesses against him as damaging as\r\ncan be: accusers in the highest degree inefficient: the panel of jurors\r\nof varied character: the president a man of weight and decision--Alfius:\r\nPompey active in soliciting the jurors on his behalf. What the result\r\nwill be I don't know; I don't see, however, how he can maintain a\r\nposition in the state. I shew no rancour in promoting his destruction,\r\nand await the result with the utmost good temper. That is nearly all the\r\nnews. I will add this one item: your boy (who is mine also) is\r\nexceedingly devoted to his rhetoric master Pæonius, a man, I think, of\r\ngreat experience in his profession, and of very good character. But you\r\nare aware that my method of instruction aims at a somewhat more\r\nscholarly and philosophical style.[645] Accordingly I, for my part, am\r\nunwilling that his course of training should be interrupted, and the boy\r\nhimself seems to be more drawn to that declamatory style, and to like it\r\nbetter; and as that was the style in which I was myself initiated, let\r\nus allow him to follow in my path, for I feel sure it will eventually\r\nbring him to the same point; nevertheless, if I take him with me\r\nsomewhere in the country, I shall guide him to the adoption of my system\r\nand practice. For you have held out before me a great reward, which it\r\ncertainly shall not be my fault if I fail to fully obtain. I hope you\r\nwill write and tell me most carefully in what district you are going to\r\npass the winter, and what your prospects are.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 645: θετικώτερον.

Nothing could be more absolutely futile\r\nthan his accuser, Lentulus, and the backers of the indictment, or more\r\ncorrupt than the jury. Yet, after all, had it not been for incredible\r\nexertions and entreaties on Pompey's part, and even an alarming rumour\r\nof a dictatorship, he would not have been able to answer even Lentulus;\r\nfor even as it was, with such an accuser and such a jury, he had\r\nthirty-two votes out of seventy recorded against him. This trial is\r\naltogether so scandalous, that he seems certain to be convicted in the\r\nother suits, especially in that for extortion. But you must see that the\r\nRepublic, the senate, the law courts are mere cyphers, and that not one\r\nof us has any constitutional position at all. What else should I tell\r\nyou about the jurors? Two men of prætorian rank were on the\r\npanel--Domitius Calvinus, who voted for acquittal so openly that\r\neverybody could see; and Cato, who, as soon as the voting tablets had\r\nbeen counted, withdrew from the ring of people, and was the first to\r\ntell Pompey the news. Some people--for instance, Sallust--say that I\r\nought to have been the prosecuting counsel. Was I to have exposed myself\r\nto such a jury as this? What would have been my position, if he had\r\nescaped when I conducted the case? But there were other considerations\r\nwhich influenced me. Pompey would have looked upon it as a contest with\r\nme, not for that man's safety, but for his own position: he would have\r\nentered the city;[646] it would have become a downright quarrel; I\r\nshould have seemed like a Pacideianus matched with the Samnite\r\nÆserninus[647]--he would, perhaps, have bitten off my ear,[648] and at\r\nleast he would have become reconciled to Clodius. For my part,\r\nespecially if you do not disapprove of it, I strongly approve my own\r\npolicy. That great man, though his advancement had been promoted by\r\nunparalleled exertions on my part, and though I owed him nothing, while\r\nhe owed me all, yet could not endure that I should differ from him in\r\npolitics--to put it mildly--and, when in a less powerful position,\r\nshewed me what he could do against me when in my zenith. At this time of\r\nday, when I don't even care to be influential, and the Republic\r\ncertainly has no power to do anything, while he is supreme in\r\neverything, was I to enter upon a contest with him? For that is what I\r\nshould have had to have done. I do not think that you hold me bound to\r\nhave undertaken it. \"Then, as an alternative,\" says the grave Sallust,\r\n\"you should have defended him, and have made that concession to Pompey's\r\nearnest wish, for he begged you very hard to do so.\" An ingenious friend\r\nis Sallust, to give me the alternative of a dangerous quarrel or undying\r\ninfamy! I, however, am quite pleased with the middle course which I have\r\nsteered; and another gratifying circumstance is that, when I had given\r\nmy evidence with the utmost solemnity, in accordance with my honour and\r\noath, the defendant said that, if he retained his right to remain in the\r\ncity, he would repay me, and did not attempt to cross-question me.\r\n\r\nAs to the verses which you wish me to compose, it is true that I am\r\ndeficient in industry in regard to them, which requires not only time,\r\nbut also a mind free from all anxiety, but I am also wanting in\r\ninspiration. For I am not altogether without anxiety as to the coming\r\nyear, though without fear. At the same time, and, upon my word, I speak\r\nwithout irony, I consider you a greater master of that style of writing\r\nthan myself. As to filling up your Greek library, effecting interchanges\r\nof books, and purchasing Latin books, I should be very glad that your\r\nwishes should be carried out, especially as they would be very useful to\r\nme. But I have no one to employ for myself in such a business: for such\r\nbooks as are really worth getting are not for sale, and purchases cannot\r\nbe effected except by an agent who is both well-informed and active.\r\nHowever, I will give orders to Chrysippus and speak to Tyrannio. I will\r\ninquire what Scipio has done about the treasury. I will see that what\r\nseems to be the right thing is done. As to Ascanio, do what you like: I\r\nshall not interfere. As to a suburban property, I commend your not being\r\nin a hurry, but I advise your having one. I write this on the 24th of\r\nOctober, the day of the opening of the games, on the point of starting\r\nfor my Tusculan villa, and taking my dear young Cicero with me as though\r\nto school (a school not for sport, but for learning), since I did not\r\nwish to be at any greater distance from town, because I purposed\r\nsupporting Pomptinus's[649] claim of a triumph on the 3rd of November.\r\nFor there will be, in fact, some little difficulty; as the prætors, Cato\r\nand Servilius,[650] threaten to forbid it, though I don't know what they\r\ncan do. For he will have on his side Appius the consul, some prætors and\r\ntribunes. Still, they do threaten--and among the foremost Q.

As for\r\nyour saying that my services to you are gratefully accepted, it is you\r\nwho in your overflowing affection make things, which cannot be omitted\r\nwithout criminal negligence, appear deserving of even gratitude.\r\nHowever, my feelings towards you would have been much more fully known\r\nand conspicuous, if, during all this time that we have been separated,\r\nwe had been together, and together at Rome. For precisely in what you\r\ndeclare your intention of doing--what no one is more capable of doing,\r\nand what I confidently look forward to from you--that is to say, in\r\nspeaking in the senate, and in every department of public life and\r\npolitical activity, we should together have been in a very strong\r\nposition (what my feelings and position are in regard to politics I will\r\nexplain shortly, and will answer the questions you ask), and at any rate\r\nI should have found in you a supporter, at once most warmly attached and\r\nendowed with supreme wisdom, while in me you would have found an\r\nadviser, perhaps not the most unskilful in the world, and at least both\r\nfaithful and devoted to your interests. However, for your own sake, of\r\ncourse, I rejoice, as I am bound to do, that you have been greeted with\r\nthe title of _imperator_, and are holding your province and victorious\r\narmy after a successful campaign. But certainly, if you had been here,\r\nyou would have enjoyed to a fuller extent and more directly the benefit\r\nof the services which I am bound to render you. Moreover, in taking\r\nvengeance on those whom you know in some cases to be your enemies,\r\nbecause you championed the cause of my recall, in others to be jealous\r\nof the splendid position and renown which that measure brought you, I\r\nshould have done you yeoman's service as your associate. However, that\r\nperpetual enemy of his own friends, who, in spite of having been\r\nhonoured with the highest compliments on your part, has selected you of\r\nall people for the object of his impotent and enfeebled violence, has\r\nsaved me the trouble by punishing himself. For he has made attempts, the\r\ndisclosure of which has left him without a shred, not only of political\r\nposition, but even of freedom of action.[653] And though I should have\r\npreferred that you should have gained your experience in my case alone,\r\nrather than in your own also, yet in the midst of my regret I am glad\r\nthat you have learnt what the fidelity of mankind is worth, at no great\r\ncost to yourself, which I learnt at the price of excessive pain. And I\r\nthink that I have now an opportunity presented me, while answering the\r\nquestions you have addressed to me, of also explaining my entire\r\nposition and view. You say in your letter that you have been informed\r\nthat I have become reconciled to Cæsar and Appius, and you add that you\r\nhave no fault to find with that. But you express a wish to know what\r\ninduced me to defend and compliment Vatinius. In order to make my\r\nexplanation plainer I must go a little farther back in the statement of\r\nmy policy and its grounds.\r\n\r\nWell, Lentulus! At first--after the success of your efforts for my\r\nrecall--I looked upon myself as having been restored not alone to my\r\nfriends, but to the Republic also; and seeing that I owed you an\r\naffection almost surpassing belief, and every kind of service, however\r\ngreat and rare, that could be bestowed on your person, I thought that to\r\nthe Republic, which had much assisted you in restoring me, I at least\r\nwas bound to entertain the feeling which I had in old times shewed\r\nmerely from the duty incumbent on all citizens alike, and not as an\r\nobligation incurred by some special kindness to myself. That these were\r\nmy sentiments I declared to the senate when you were consul, and you had\r\nyourself a full view of them in our conversations and discussions. Yet\r\nfrom the very first my feelings were hurt by many circumstances, when,\r\non your mooting the question of the full restoration of my position, I\r\ndetected the covert hatred of some and the equivocal attachment of\r\nothers. For you received no support from them either in regard to my\r\nmonuments, or the illegal violence by which, in common with my brother,\r\nI had been driven from my house; nor, by heaven, did they shew the\r\ngoodwill which I had expected in regard to those matters which, though\r\nnecessary to me owing to the shipwreck of my fortune, were yet regarded\r\nby me as least valuable--I mean as to indemnifying me for my losses by\r\ndecree of the senate. And though I saw all this--for it was not\r\ndifficult to see--yet their present conduct did not affect me with so\r\nmuch bitterness as what they had done for me did with gratitude. And\r\ntherefore, though according to your own assertion and testimony I was\r\nunder very great obligation to Pompey, and though I loved him not only\r\nfor his kindness, but also from my own feelings, and, so to speak, from\r\nmy unbroken admiration of him, nevertheless, without taking any account\r\nof his wishes, I abode by all my old opinions in politics.[654] With\r\nPompey sitting in court,[655] upon his having entered the city to give\r\nevidence in favour of Sestius, and when the witness Vatinius had\r\nasserted that, moved by the good fortune and success of Cæsar, I had\r\nbegun to be his friend, I said that I preferred the fortune of Bibulus,\r\nwhich he thought a humiliation, to the triumphs and victories of\r\neverybody else; and I said during the examination of the same witness,\r\nin another part of my speech, that the same men had prevented Bibulus\r\nfrom leaving his house as had forced me from mine: my whole\r\ncross-examination, indeed, was nothing but a denunciation of his\r\ntribuneship;[656] and in it I spoke throughout with the greatest\r\nfreedom and spirit about violence, neglect of omens, grants of royal\r\ntitles. Nor, indeed, in the support of this view is it only of late that\r\nI have spoken: I have done so consistently on several occasions in the\r\nsenate. Nay, even in the consulship of Marcellinus and Philippus,[657]\r\non the 5th of April the senate voted on my motion that the question of\r\nthe Campanian land should be referred to a full meeting of the senate on\r\nthe 15th of May. Could I more decidedly invade the stronghold of his\r\npolicy, or shew more clearly that I forgot my own present interests, and\r\nremembered my former political career? On my delivery of this proposal a\r\ngreat impression was made on the minds not only of those who were bound\r\nto have been impressed, but also of those of whom I had never expected\r\nit. For, after this decree had passed in accordance with my motion,\r\nPompey, without shewing the least sign of being offended with me,\r\nstarted for Sardinia and Africa, and in the course of that journey\r\nvisited Cæsar at Luca. There Cæsar complained a great deal about my\r\nmotion, for he had already seen Crassus at Ravenna also, and had been\r\nirritated by him against me. It was well known that Pompey was much\r\nvexed at this, as I was told by others, but learnt most definitely from\r\nmy brother. For when Pompey met him in Sardinia, a few days after\r\nleaving Luca, he said: \"You are the very man I want to see; nothing\r\ncould have happened more conveniently. Unless you speak very strongly to\r\nyour brother Marcus, you will have to pay up what you guaranteed on his\r\nbehalf.\"[658] I need not go on. He grumbled a great deal: mentioned his\r\nown services to me: recalled what he had again and again said to my\r\nbrother himself about the \"acts\" of Cæsar, and what my brother had\r\nundertaken in regard to me; and called my brother himself to witness\r\nthat what he had done in regard to my recall he had done with the\r\nconsent of Cæsar: and asked him to commend to me the latter's policy and\r\nclaims, that I should not attack, even if I would not or could not\r\nsupport them. My brother having conveyed these remarks to me, and\r\nPompey having, nevertheless, sent Vibullius to me with a message,\r\nbegging me not to commit myself on the question of the Campanian land\r\ntill his return, I reconsidered my position and begged the state itself,\r\nas it were, to allow me, who had suffered and done so much for it, to\r\nfulfil the duty which gratitude to my benefactors and the pledge which\r\nmy brother had given demanded, and to suffer one whom it had ever\r\nregarded as an honest citizen to shew himself an honest man. Moreover,\r\nin regard to all those motions and speeches of mine which appeared to be\r\ngiving offence to Pompey, the remarks of a particular set of men, whose\r\nnames you must surely guess, kept on being reported to me; who, while in\r\npublic affairs they were really in sympathy with my policy, and had\r\nalways been so, yet said that they were glad that Pompey was\r\ndissatisfied with me, and that Cæsar would be very greatly exasperated\r\nagainst me. This in itself was vexatious to me: but much more so was the\r\nfact that they used, before my very eyes, so to embrace, fondle, make\r\nmuch of, and kiss my enemy--mine do I say? rather the enemy of the laws,\r\nof the law courts, of peace, of his country, of all loyal men!--that\r\nthey did not indeed rouse my bile, for I have utterly lost all that, but\r\nimagined they did. In these circumstances, having, as far as is possible\r\nfor human prudence, thoroughly examined my whole position, and having\r\nbalanced the items of the account, I arrived at a final result of all my\r\nreflexions, which, as well as I can, I will now briefly put before you.\r\n\r\nIf I had seen the Republic in the hands of bad or profligate citizens,\r\nas we know happened during the supremacy of Cinna, and on some other\r\noccasions, I should not under the pressure, I don't say of rewards,\r\nwhich are the last things to influence me, but even of danger, by which,\r\nafter all, the bravest men are moved, have attached myself to their\r\nparty, not even if their services to me had been of the very highest\r\nkind. As it is, seeing that the leading statesman in the Republic was\r\nPompey, a man who had gained this power and renown by the most eminent\r\nservices to the state and the most glorious achievements, and one of\r\nwhose position I had been a supporter from my youth up, and in my\r\nprætorship and consulship an active promoter also, and seeing that this\r\nsame statesman had assisted me, in his own person by the weight of his\r\ninfluence and the expression of his opinion, and, in conjunction with\r\nyou, by his counsels and zeal, and that he regarded my enemy as his own\r\nsupreme enemy in the state--I did not think that I need fear the\r\nreproach of inconsistency, if in some of my senatorial votes I somewhat\r\nchanged my standpoint, and contributed my zeal to the promotion of the\r\ndignity of a most distinguished man, and one to whom I am under the\r\nhighest obligations. In this sentiment I had necessarily to include\r\nCæsar, as you see, for their policy and position were inseparably\r\nunited. Here I was greatly influenced by two things--the old friendship\r\nwhich you know that I and my brother Quintus have had with Cæsar, and\r\nhis own kindness and liberality, of which we have recently had clear and\r\nunmistakable evidence both by his letters and his personal attentions. I\r\nwas also strongly affected by the Republic itself, which appeared to me\r\nto demand, especially considering Cæsar's brilliant successes, that\r\nthere should be no quarrel maintained with these men, and indeed to\r\nforbid it in the strongest manner possible. Moreover, while entertaining\r\nthese feelings, I was above all shaken by the pledge which Pompey had\r\ngiven for me to Cæsar, and my brother to Pompey. Besides, I was forced\r\nto take into consideration the state maxim so divinely expressed by our\r\nmaster Plato--\"Such as are the chief men in a republic, such are ever\r\nwont to be the other citizens.\" I called to mind that in my consulship,\r\nfrom the very 1st of January, such a foundation was laid of\r\nencouragement for the senate, that no one ought to have been surprised\r\nthat on the 5th of December there was so much spirit and such commanding\r\ninfluence in that house. I also remember that when I became a private\r\ncitizen up to the consulship of Cæsar and Bibulus, when the opinions\r\nexpressed by me had great weight in the senate, the feeling among all\r\nthe loyalists was invariable. Afterwards, while you were holding the\r\nprovince of hither Spain with _imperium_ and the Republic had no genuine\r\nconsuls, but mere hucksters of provinces, mere slaves and agents of\r\nsedition, an accident threw my head as an apple of discord into the\r\nmidst of contending factions and civil broils. And in that hour of\r\ndanger, though a unanimity was displayed on the part of the senate that\r\nwas surprising, on the part of all Italy surpassing belief, and of all\r\nthe loyalists unparalleled, in standing forth in my defence, I will not\r\nsay what happened--for the blame attaches to many, and is of various\r\nshades of turpitude--I will only say briefly that it was not the rank\r\nand file, but the leaders, that played me false. And in this matter,\r\nthough some blame does attach to those who failed to defend me, no less\r\nattaches to those who abandoned me: and if those who were frightened\r\ndeserve reproach, if there are such, still more are those to be blamed\r\nwho pretended to be frightened. At any rate, my policy is justly to be\r\npraised for refusing to allow my fellow citizens (preserved by me and\r\nardently desiring to preserve me) to be exposed while bereft of leaders\r\nto armed slaves, and for preferring that it should be made manifest how\r\nmuch force there might be in the unanimity of the loyalists, if they had\r\nbeen permitted to champion my cause before I had fallen, when after that\r\nfall they had proved strong enough to raise me up again. And the real\r\nfeelings of these men you not only had the penetration to see, when\r\nbringing forward my case, but the power to encourage and keep alive. In\r\npromoting which measure--I will not merely not deny, but shall always\r\nremember also and gladly proclaim it--you found certain men of the\r\nhighest rank more courageous in securing my restoration than they had\r\nbeen in preserving me from my fall: and, if they had chosen to maintain\r\nthat frame of mind, they would have recovered their own commanding\r\nposition along with my salvation. For when the spirit of the loyalists\r\nhad been renewed by your consulship, and they had been roused from their\r\ndismay by the extreme firmness and rectitude of your official conduct;\r\nwhen, above all, Pompey's support had been secured; and when Cæsar, too,\r\nwith all the prestige of his brilliant achievements, after being\r\nhonoured with unique and unprecedented marks of distinction and\r\ncompliments by the senate, was now supporting the dignity of the house,\r\nthere could have been no opportunity for a disloyal citizen of outraging\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\nBut now notice, I beg, what actually ensued. First of all, that intruder\r\nupon the women's rites, who had shewn no more respect for the Bona Dea\r\nthan for his three sisters, secured immunity by the votes of those men\r\nwho, when a tribune wished by a legal action to exact penalties from a\r\nseditious citizen by the agency of the loyalists, deprived the Republic\r\nof what would have been hereafter a most splendid precedent for the\r\npunishment of sedition. And these same persons, in the case of the\r\nmonument, which was not mine, indeed--for it was not erected from the\r\nproceeds of spoils won by me, and I had nothing to do with it beyond\r\ngiving out the contract for its construction--well, they allowed this\r\nmonument of the senate's to have branded upon it the name of a public\r\nenemy, and an inscription written in blood. That those men wished my\r\nsafety rouses my liveliest gratitude, but I could have wished that they\r\nhad not chosen to take my bare safety into consideration, like doctors,\r\nbut, like trainers, my strength and complexion also! As it is, just as\r\nApelles perfected the head and bust of his Venus with the most elaborate\r\nart, but left the rest of her body in the rough, so certain persons only\r\ntook pains with my head, and left the rest of my body unfinished and\r\nunworked. Yet in this matter I have falsified the expectation, not only\r\nof the jealous, but also of the downright hostile, who formerly\r\nconceived a wrong opinion from the case of Quintus Metellus, son of\r\nLucius--the most energetic and gallant man in the world, and in my\r\nopinion of surpassing courage and firmness--who, people say, was much\r\ncast down and dispirited after his return from exile.[659] Now, in the\r\nfirst place, we are asked to believe that a man who accepted exile with\r\nentire willingness and remarkable cheerfulness, and never took any pains\r\nat all to get recalled, was crushed in spirit about an affair in which\r\nhe had shewn more firmness and constancy than anyone else, even than the\r\npre-eminent M. Scaurus himself![660] But, again, the account they had\r\nreceived, or rather the conjectures they were indulging in about him,\r\nthey now transferred to me, imagining that I should be more than usually\r\nbroken in spirit: whereas, in fact, the Republic was inspiring me with\r\neven greater courage than I had ever had before, by making it plain\r\nthat I was the one citizen it could not do without; and by the fact that\r\nwhile a bill proposed by only one tribune had recalled Metellus, the\r\nwhole state had joined as one man in recalling me--the senate leading\r\nthe way, the whole of Italy following after, eight of the tribunes\r\npublishing the bill, a consul putting the question at the centuriate\r\nassembly, all orders and individuals pressing it on, in fact, with all\r\nthe forces at its command. Nor is it the case that I afterwards made any\r\npretension, or am making any at this day, which can justly offend\r\nanyone, even the most malevolent: my only effort is that I may not fail\r\neither my friends or those more remotely connected with me in either\r\nactive service, or counsel, or personal exertion. This course of life\r\nperhaps offends those who fix their eyes on the glitter and show of my\r\nprofessional position, but are unable to appreciate its anxieties and\r\nlaboriousness.\r\n\r\nAgain, they make no concealment of their dissatisfaction on the ground\r\nthat in the speeches which I make in the senate in praise of Cæsar I am\r\ndeparting from my old policy. But while giving explanations on the\r\npoints which I put before you a short time ago, I will not keep till the\r\nlast the following, which I have already touched upon. You will not\r\nfind, my dear Lentulus, the sentiments of the loyalists the same as you\r\nleft them--strengthened by my consulship, suffering relapse at intervals\r\nafterwards, crushed down before your consulship, revived by you: they\r\nhave now been abandoned by those whose duty it was to have maintained\r\nthem: and this fact they, who in the old state of things as it existed\r\nin our day used to be called _Optimates_, not only declare by look and\r\nexpression of countenance, by which a false pretence is easiest\r\nsupported, but have proved again and again by their actual sympathies\r\nand votes. Accordingly, the entire view and aim of wise citizens, such\r\nas I wish both to be and to be reckoned, must needs have undergone a\r\nchange. For that is the maxim of that same great Plato, whom I\r\nemphatically regard as my master: \"Maintain a political controversy only\r\nso far as you can convince your fellow citizens of its justice: never\r\noffer violence to parent or fatherland.\"[661] He, it is true, alleges\r\nthis as his motive for having abstained from politics, because, having\r\nfound the Athenian people all but in its dotage, and seeing that it\r\ncould not be ruled by persuasion, or by anything short of compulsion,\r\nwhile he doubted the possibility of persuasion, he looked upon\r\ncompulsion as criminal. My position was different in this: as the people\r\nwas not in its dotage, nor the question of engaging in politics still an\r\nopen one for me, I was bound hand and foot. Yet I rejoiced that I was\r\npermitted in one and the same cause to support a policy at once\r\nadvantageous to myself and acceptable to every loyalist. An additional\r\nmotive was Cæsar's memorable and almost superhuman kindness to myself\r\nand my brother, who thus would have deserved my support whatever he\r\nundertook; while as it is, considering his great success and his\r\nbrilliant victories, he would seem, even if he had not behaved to me as\r\nhe has, to claim a panegyric from me. For I would have you believe that,\r\nputting you aside, who were the authors of my recall, there is no one by\r\nwhose good offices I would not only confess, but would even rejoice, to\r\nhave been so much bound.\r\n\r\nHaving explained this matter to you, the questions you ask about\r\nVatinius and Crassus are easy to answer. For, since you remark about\r\nAppius, as about Cæsar, \"that you have no fault to find,\" I can only say\r\nthat I am glad you approve my policy. But as to Vatinius, in the first\r\nplace there had been in the interval a reconciliation effected through\r\nPompey, immediately after his election to the prætorship, though I had,\r\nit is true, impugned his canditature in some very strong speeches in the\r\nsenate, and yet not so much for the sake of attacking him as of\r\ndefending and complimenting Cato. Again, later on, there followed a very\r\npressing request from Cæsar that I should undertake his defence. But my\r\nreason for testifying to his character I beg you will not ask, either in\r\nthe case of this defendant or of others, lest I retaliate by asking you\r\nthe same question when you come home: though I can do so even before you\r\nreturn: for remember for whom you sent a certificate of character from\r\nthe ends of the earth. However, don't be afraid, for those same persons\r\nare praised by myself, and will continue to be so. Yet, after all, there\r\nwas also the motive spurring me on to undertake his defence, of which,\r\nduring the trial, when I appeared for him, I remarked that I was doing\r\njust what the parasite in the _Eunuchus_ advised the captain to do:\r\n\r\n    \"As oft as she names Phædria, you retort\r\n    With Pamphila. If ever she suggest,\r\n    'Do let us have in Phædria to our revel:'\r\n    Quoth you, 'And let us call on Pamphila\r\n    To sing a song.' If she shall praise _his_ looks,\r\n    Do you praise _hers_ to match them: and, in fine,\r\n    Give tit for tat, that you may sting her soul.\"\r\n\r\nSo I asked the jurors, since certain men of high rank, who had also done\r\nme very great favours, were much enamoured of my enemy, and often under\r\nmy very eyes in the senate now took him aside in grave consultation, now\r\nembraced him familiarly and cheerfully--since these men had their\r\nPublius, to grant me another Publius, in whose person I might repay a\r\nslight attack by a moderate retort.[662] And, indeed, I am often as good\r\nas my word, with the applause of gods and men. So much for Vatinius. Now\r\nabout Crassus. I thought I had done much to secure his gratitude in\r\nhaving, for the sake of the general harmony, wiped out by a kind of\r\nvoluntary act of oblivion all his very serious injuries, when he\r\nsuddenly undertook the defence of Gabinius, whom only a few days before\r\nhe had attacked with the greatest bitterness. Nevertheless, I should\r\nhave borne that, if he had done so without casting any offensive\r\nreflexions on me. But on his attacking me, though I was only arguing and\r\nnot inveighing against him, I fired up not only, I think, with the\r\npassion of the moment--for that perhaps would not have been so hot--but\r\nthe smothered wrath at his many wrongs to me, of which I thought I had\r\nwholly got rid, having, unconsciously to myself, lingered in my soul, it\r\nsuddenly shewed itself in full force. And it was at this precise time\r\nthat certain persons (the same whom I frequently indicate by a sign or\r\nhint), while declaring that they had much enjoyed my outspoken style,\r\nand had never before fully realized that I was restored to the Republic\r\nin all my old character, and when my conduct of that controversy had\r\ngained me much credit outside the house also, began saying that they\r\nwere glad both that he was now my enemy, and that those who were\r\ninvolved with him would never be my friends. So when their ill-natured\r\nremarks were reported to me by men of most respectable character, and\r\nwhen Pompey pressed me as he had never done before to be reconciled to\r\nCrassus, and Cæsar wrote to say that he was exceedingly grieved at that\r\nquarrel, I took into consideration not only my circumstances, but my\r\nnatural inclination: and Crassus, that our reconciliation might, as it\r\nwere, be attested to the Roman people, started for his province, it\r\nmight almost be said, from my hearth. For he himself named a day and\r\ndined with me in the suburban villa of my son-in-law Crassipes. On this\r\naccount, as you say that you have been told, I supported his cause in\r\nthe senate, which I had undertaken on Pompey's strong recommendation, as\r\nI was bound in honour to do.\r\n\r\nI have now told you with what motives I have supported each measure and\r\ncause, and what my position is in politics as far as I take any part in\r\nthem: and I would wish you to make sure of this--that I should have\r\nentertained the same sentiments, if I had been still perfectly\r\nuncommitted and free to choose. For I should not have thought it right\r\nto fight against such overwhelming power, nor to destroy the supremacy\r\nof the most distinguished citizens, even if it had been possible; nor,\r\nagain, should I have thought myself bound to abide by the same view,\r\nwhen circumstances were changed and the feelings of the loyalists\r\naltered, but rather to bow to circumstances. For the persistence in the\r\nsame view has never been regarded as a merit in men eminent for their\r\nguidance of the helm of state; but as in steering a ship one secret of\r\nthe art is to run before the storm, even if you cannot make the harbour;\r\nyet, when you can do so by tacking about, it is folly to keep to the\r\ncourse you have begun rather than by changing it to arrive all the same\r\nat the destination you desire: so while we all ought in the\r\nadministration of the state to keep always in view the object I have\r\nvery frequently mentioned, peace combined with dignity, we are not bound\r\nalways to use the same language, but to fix our eyes on the same object.\r\nWherefore, as I laid down a little while ago, if I had had as free a\r\nhand as possible in everything, I should yet have been no other than I\r\nnow am in politics. When, moreover, I am at once induced to adopt these\r\nsentiments by the kindness of certain persons, and driven to do so by\r\nthe injuries of others, I am quite content to think and speak about\r\npublic affairs as I conceive best conduces to the interests both of\r\nmyself and of the Republic. Moreover, I make this declaration the more\r\nopenly and frequently, both because my brother Quintus is Cæsar's\r\nlegate, and because no word of mine, however trivial, to say nothing of\r\nany act, in support of Cæsar has ever transpired, which he has not\r\nreceived with such marked gratitude, as to make me look upon myself as\r\nclosely bound to him. Accordingly, I have the advantage of his\r\npopularity, which you know to be very great, and his material resources,\r\nwhich you know to be immense, as though they were my own. Nor do I think\r\nthat I could in any other way have frustrated the plots of unprincipled\r\npersons against me, unless I had now combined with those protections,\r\nwhich I have always possessed, the goodwill also of the men in power. I\r\nshould, to the best of my belief, have followed this same line of policy\r\neven if I had had you here. For I well know the reasonableness and\r\nsoberness of your judgment: I know your mind, while warmly attached to\r\nme, to be without a tinge of malevolence to others, but on the contrary\r\nas open and candid as it is great and lofty. I have seen certain persons\r\nconduct themselves towards you as you might have seen the same persons\r\nconduct themselves towards me. The same things that have annoyed me\r\nwould certainly have annoyed you. But whenever I shall have the\r\nenjoyment of your presence, you will be the wise critic of all my plans:\r\nyou who took thought for my safety will also do so for my dignity. Me,\r\nindeed, you will have as the partner and associate in all your actions,\r\nsentiments, wishes--in fact, in everything; nor shall I ever in all my\r\nlife have any purpose so steadfastly before me, as that you should\r\nrejoice more and more warmly every day that you did me such eminent\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nAs to your request that I would send you any books I have written since\r\nyour departure, there are some speeches, which I will give Menocritus,\r\nnot so very many, so don't be afraid! I have also written--for I am now\r\nrather withdrawing from oratory and returning to the gentler Muses,\r\nwhich now give me greater delight than any others, as they have done\r\nsince my earliest youth--well, then, I have written in the Aristotelian\r\nstyle, at least that was my aim, three books in the form of a discussion\r\nin dialogue \"On the Orator,\" which, I think, will be of some service to\r\nyour Lentulus. For they differ a good deal from the current maxims, and\r\nembrace a discussion on the whole oratorical theory of the ancients,\r\nboth that of Aristotle and Isocrates. I have also written in verse three\r\nbooks \"On my own Times,\" which I should have sent you some time ago, if\r\nI had thought they ought to be published--for they are witnesses, and\r\nwill be eternal witnesses, of your services to me and of my\r\naffection--but I refrained because I was afraid, not of those who might\r\nthink themselves attacked, for I have been very sparing and gentle in\r\nthat respect, but of my benefactors, of whom it were an endless task to\r\nmention the whole list. Nevertheless, the books, such as they are, if I\r\nfind anyone to whom I can safely commit them, I will take care to have\r\nconveyed to you: and as far as that part of my life and conduct is\r\nconcerned, I submit it entirely to your judgment. All that I shall\r\nsucceed in accomplishing in literature or in learning--my old favourite\r\nrelaxations--I shall with the utmost cheerfulness place before the bar\r\nof your criticism, for you have always had a fondness for such things.\r\nAs to what you say in your letter about your domestic affairs, and all\r\nyou charge me to do, I am so attentive to them that I don't like being\r\nreminded, can scarcely bear, indeed, to be asked without a very painful\r\nfeeling. As to your saying, in regard to Quintus's business, that you\r\ncould not do anything last summer, because you were prevented by illness\r\nfrom crossing to Cilicia, but that you will now do everything in your\r\npower to settle it, I may tell you that the fact of the matter is that,\r\nif he can annex this property, my brother thinks that he will owe to you\r\nthe consolidation of this ancestral estate. I should like you to write\r\nabout all your affairs, and about the studies and training of your son\r\nLentulus (whom I regard as mine also) as confidentially and as\r\nfrequently as possible, and to believe that there never has been anyone\r\neither dearer or more congenial to another than you are to me, and that\r\nI will not only make you feel that to be the case, but will make all the\r\nworld and posterity itself to the latest generation aware of it.\r\n\r\nAppius used some time back to repeat in conversation, and afterwards\r\nsaid openly, even in the senate, that if he were allowed to carry a law\r\nin the _comitia curiata_, he would draw lots with his colleague for\r\ntheir provinces; but if no curiatian law were passed, he would make an\r\narrangement with his colleague and succeed you: that a curiatian law was\r\na proper thing for a consul, but was not a necessity: that since he was\r\nin possession of a province by a decree of the senate, he should have\r\n_imperium_ in virtue of the Cornelian law until such time as he entered\r\nthe city. I don't know what your several connexions write to you on the\r\nsubject: I understand that opinion varies. There are some who think that\r\nyou can legally refuse to quit your province, because your successor is\r\nnamed without a curiatian law: some also hold that, even if you do quit\r\nit, you may leave some one behind you to conduct its government. For\r\nmyself, I do not feel so certain about the point of law--although there\r\nis not much doubt even about that--as I do of this, that it is for your\r\ngreatest honour, dignity, and independence, which I know you always\r\nvalue above everything, to hand over your province to a successor\r\nwithout any delay, especially as you cannot thwart his greediness\r\nwithout rousing suspicion of your own. I regard my duty as twofold--to\r\nlet you know what I think, and to defend what you have done.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I had written the above when I received your letter about the\r\n_publicani_, to whom I could not but admire the justice of your conduct.\r\nI could have wished that you had been able by some lucky chance to avoid\r\nrunning counter to the interests and wishes of that order, whose honour\r\nyou have always promoted. For my part, I shall not cease to defend your\r\ndecrees: but you know the ways of that class of men; you are aware how\r\nbitterly hostile they were to the famous Q. Scævola himself. However, I\r\nadvise you to reconcile that order to yourself, or at least soften its\r\nfeelings, if you can by any means do so. Though difficult, I think it\r\nis, nevertheless, not beyond the reach of your sagacity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 652: Cicero gives him this title, by which he had been greeted\r\nby his soldiers after some victory over the predatory tribes in Cilicia.\r\nThis letter is Cicero's most elaborate apology for his change of policy\r\nin favour of the triumvirs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 653: Cicero has been variously supposed to refer to C. Cato\r\n(who proposed the recall of Lentulus), to Appius the consul, and finally\r\nto Pompey. The last seems on the whole most likely, though the\r\nexplanation is not without difficulties.

As it is,[663] to tell you my opinion of affairs, we must put up\r\nwith it. You ask me how I have behaved. With firmness and dignity. \"What\r\nabout Pompey,\" you will say, \"how did he take it?\" With great\r\nconsideration, and with the conviction that he must have some regard for\r\nmy position, until a satisfactory atonement had been made to me. \"How,\r\nthen,\" you will say, \"was the acquittal secured?\" It was a case of mere\r\ndummies,[664] and incredible incompetence on the part of the\r\naccusers--that is to say, of L. Lentulus, son of Lucius, who, according\r\nto the universal murmur, acted collusively. In the next place, Pompey\r\nwas extraordinarily urgent; and the jurors were a mean set of fellows.\r\nYet, in spite of everything, there were thirty-two votes for conviction,\r\nthirty-eight for acquittal. There are the other prosecutions hanging\r\nover his head: he is by no means entirely free yet. You will say, \"Well,\r\nthen, how do _you_ bear it?\" With the best air possible, by heaven! and\r\nI really do plume myself on my behaviour. We have lost, my dear\r\nPomponius, not only all the healthy sap and blood of our old\r\nconstitution, but even its colour and outward show. There is no Republic\r\nto give a moment's pleasure or a feeling of security. \"And is that,\r\nthen,\" you will say, \"a satisfaction to you?\" Precisely that. For I\r\nrecall what a fair course the state had for a short time, while I was at\r\nthe helm, and what a return has been made me! It does not give me a pang\r\nthat one man absorbs all power. The men to burst with envy are those who\r\nwere indignant at my having had some power. There are many things which\r\nconsole me, without my departing an inch from my regular position; and I\r\nam returning to the life best suited to my natural disposition--to\r\nletters and the studies that I love. My labour in pleading I console by\r\nmy delight in oratory. I find delight in my town house and my country\r\nresidences. I do not recall the height from which I have fallen, but the\r\nhumble position from which I have risen. As long as I have my brother\r\nand you with me, let those fellows be hanged, drawn, and quartered for\r\nall I care: I can play the philosopher with you. That part of my soul,\r\nin which in old times irritability had its home, has grown completely\r\ncallous. I find no pleasure in anything that is not private and\r\ndomestic. You will find me in a state of magnificent repose, to which\r\nnothing contributes more than the prospect of your return. For there is\r\nno one in the wide world whose feelings are so much in sympathy with my\r\nown. But now let me tell you the rest. Matters are drifting on to an\r\n_interregnum_; and there is a dictatorship in the air, in fact a good\r\ndeal of talk about it, which did Gabinius also some service with timid\r\njurors. All the candidates for the consulship are charged with bribery.\r\nYou may add to them Gabinius, on whom L. Sulla had served notice,\r\nfeeling certain that he was in a hopeless position--Torquatus having,\r\nwithout success, demanded to have the prosecution. But they will all be\r\nacquitted, and henceforth no one will be condemned for anything except\r\nhomicide. This last charge is warmly pressed, and accordingly informers\r\nare busy. M. Fulvius Nobilior has been convicted. Many others have had\r\nthe wit to abstain from even putting in an appearance. Is there any more\r\nnews? Yes! After Gabinius's acquittal another panel of jurors, in a fit\r\nof irritation, an hour later condemned Antiochus Gabinius, some fellow\r\nfrom the studio of Sopolis, a freedman and orderly officer of Gabinius,\r\nunder the _lex Papia_. Consequently he at once remarked, \"So the\r\nRepublic will not acquit me under the law of treason as it did\r\nyou!\"[665]\r\n\r\nPomptinus wants to celebrate a triumph on the 2nd of November. He is\r\nopenly opposed by the prætors Cato and Servilius and the tribune Q.\r\nMucius. For they say that no law for his _imperium_ was ever\r\ncarried:[666] and this one too was carried, by heaven, in a stupid way.\r\nBut Pomptinus will have the consul Appius on his side.[667] Cato,\r\nhowever, declares that he shall never triumph so long as he is alive. I\r\nthink this affair, like many of the same sort, will come to nothing.\r\nAppius thinks of going to Cilicia without a law, and at his own\r\nexpense.[668] I received a letter on the 24th of October from my brother\r\nand from Cæsar, dated from the nearest coasts of Britain on the 26th of\r\nSeptember. Britain done with ... hostages taken ... no booty ... a\r\ntribute, however, imposed; they were on the point of bringing back the\r\narmy. Q. Pilius has just set out to join Cæsar. If you have any love for\r\nme or your family, or any truth in you, or even if you have any taste\r\nleft, and any idea of enjoying all your blessings, it is really time for\r\nyou to be on your way home, and, in fact, almost here. I vow I cannot\r\nget on without you. And what wonder that I can't get on without _you_,\r\nwhen I miss Dionysius so much? The latter, in fact, as soon as the day\r\ncomes, both I and my young Cicero will demand of you. The last letter I\r\nhad from you was dated Ephesus, 9th of August.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 663: The beginning of the letter is lost, referring to the\r\nacquittal of Gabinius on a charge of _maiestas_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 664: γοργεῖα γυμνά, \"mere bugbears.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 665: Antiochus Gabinius was tried, not for treason\r\n(_maiestas_), but under the _lex Papia_, for having, though a\r\n_peregrinus_, acted as a citizen; but he says \"will not acquit me of\r\n_treason_,\" because he means to infer that his condemnation was really\r\nin place of Gabinius, whose acquittal had irritated his jury; therefore\r\nhe was practically convicted of _maiestas_ instead of his patron\r\nGabinius. I have, accordingly, ventured to elicit the end of a hexameter\r\nfrom the Greek letters of the MS., of which no satisfactory account has\r\nbeen given, and to read _Itaque dixit statim \"respublica lege\r\nmaiestatis_ οὐ σοί κεν ἄρ' ἶσα μ' ἀφείη (or ἀφιῇ).\" The quotation is not\r\nknown. Antiochus Gabinius was doubtless of Greek origin and naturally\r\nquoted Greek poetry. Sopolis was a Greek painter living at Rome (Pliny,\r\n_N. H._ xxxv. §§ 40, 43).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 666: Pomptinus had been waiting outside Rome for some years to\r\nget his triumph (see p. 309). The _negant latum de imperio_ must refer\r\nto a _lex curiata_ originally conferring his _imperium_, which his\r\nopponents alleged had not been passed. The _insulse latum_ refers to the\r\nlaw now passed granting him the triumph in spite of this. This latter\r\nwas passed by the old trick of the prætor appearing in the _campus_\r\nbefore daybreak to prevent _obnuntiatio_. The result was that the\r\ntribunes interrupted the procession, which led to fighting and bloodshed\r\n(Dio, 39, 65).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 667: Because he wanted to go to his province himself in spite\r\nof having failed to get a _lex curiata_ (p. 324).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 668: _I.e._, without waiting for the senate to vote the usual\r\noutfit (_ornare provinciam_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIV (Q FR III, 5-6)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL)\r\n\r\nTUSCULUM (OCTOBER)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nYou ask me what I have done about the books which I begun to write when\r\nin my Cuman villa: I have not been idle and am not being idle now; but I\r\nhave frequently changed the whole plan and arrangement of the work. I\r\nhad already completed two books, in which I represented a conversation\r\ntaking place on the Novendialia held in the consulship of Tuditanus and\r\nAquilius,[669] between Africanus, shortly before his death, and Lælius,\r\nPhilus, Manilius, P. Rutilius, Q. Tubero, and Lælius's sons-in-law,\r\nFannius and Scævola; a conversation which was extended to nine days and\r\nthe same number of books \"On the best Constitution of the State\" and \"On\r\nthe best Citizen.\" The work was excellently composed, and the rank of\r\nthe speakers added considerable weight to the style. But when these\r\nbooks were read to me in the presence of Sallustius at Tusculum, it was\r\nsuggested to me by him that a discourse on such subjects would come with\r\nmuch greater force if I were myself the speaker on the Republic,\r\nespecially as I was a no mere Heraclides Ponticus,[670] but an\r\nex-consul, and one who had been engaged in the most important affairs in\r\nthe state: that when I put them in the mouth of men of such ancient date\r\nthey would have an air of unreality: that I had shewn good taste in my\r\nbooks about the science of rhetoric in keeping the dialogue of the\r\norators apart from myself, and yet had attributed it to men whom I had\r\npersonally seen: and, finally, that Aristotle delivers in the first\r\nperson his essays \"On the Republic\" and \"On the Eminent Man.\" I was\r\ninfluenced the more by this from the fact that I was unable to touch on\r\nthe most important commotions in our state, because they were subsequent\r\nto the age of the speakers. Moreover, my express object then was not to\r\noffend anyone by launching into the events of my own time: as it is, I\r\nshall avoid that and at the same time be the speaker with you.\r\nNevertheless, when I come to Rome I will send you the dialogues as they\r\noriginally stood. For I fancy that those books will convince you that\r\nthey have not been abandoned by me without some chagrin.\r\n\r\nI am extremely gratified by Cæsar's affection of which you write to me.\r\nThe offers which he holds out I do not much reckon on, nor have I any\r\nthirst for honours or longing for glory; and I look forward more to the\r\ncontinuation of his kindness than to the fulfilment of his promises.\r\nStill, I live a life so prominent and laborious that I might seem to be\r\nexpecting the very thing that I deprecate. As to your request that I\r\nshould compose some verses, you could hardly believe, my dear brother,\r\nhow short of time I am: nor do I feel much moved in spirit to write\r\npoetry on the subject you mention. Do you really come to me for\r\ndisquisitions on things that I can scarcely conceive even in\r\nimagination--you who have distanced everybody in that style of vivid and\r\ndescriptive writing? Yet I would have done it if I could, but, as you\r\nwill assuredly not fail to notice, for writing poetry there is need of a\r\ncertain freshness of mind of which my occupations entirely deprive me. I\r\nwithdraw myself, it is true, from all political anxiety and devote\r\nmyself to literature; still, I will hint to you what, by heaven, I\r\nspecially wished to have concealed from you. It cuts me to the heart, my\r\ndearest brother, to the heart, to think that there is no Republic, no\r\nlaw courts, and that my present time of life, which ought to have been\r\nin the full bloom of senatorial dignity, is distracted with the labours\r\nof the forum or eked out by private studies, and that the object on\r\nwhich from boyhood I had set my heart,\r\n\r\n    \"Far to excel, and tower above the crowd,\"[671]\r\n\r\nis entirely gone: that my opponents have in some cases been left\r\nunattacked by me, in others even defended: that not only my sympathies,\r\nbut my very dislikes, are not free: and that Cæsar is the one man in the\r\nworld who has been found to love me to my heart's content, or even, as\r\nothers think, the only one who was inclined to do so. However, there is\r\nnone of all these vexations of such a kind as to be beyond the reach of\r\nmany daily consolations; but the greatest of consolations will be our\r\nbeing together. As it is, to those other sources of vexation there is\r\nadded my very deep regret for your absence. If I had defended Gabinius,\r\nwhich Pansa thought I ought to have done, I should have been quite\r\nruined: those who hate him--and that is entire orders--would have begun\r\nto hate me for the sake of their hatred for him. I confined myself, as I\r\nthink with great dignity, to doing only that which all the world saw me\r\ndo. And to sum up the whole case, I am, as you advise, devoting all my\r\nefforts to tranquillity and peace. As to the books: Tyrannio is a\r\nslow-coach: I will speak to Chrysippus, but it is a laborious business\r\nand requires a man of the utmost industry. I find it in my own case,\r\nfor, though I am as diligent as possible, I get nothing done. As to the\r\nLatin books, I don't know which way to turn--they are copied and exposed\r\nfor sale with such a quantity of errors! However, whatever can possibly\r\nbe done I will not neglect to do. Gaius Rebilus, as I wrote to you\r\nbefore, is at Rome. He solemnly affirms his great obligations to you,\r\nand reports well of your health.[672] I think the question of the\r\ntreasury was settled in my absence. When you speak of having finished\r\nfour tragedies in sixteen days, I presume you are borrowing from some\r\none else? And do _you_ deign to be indebted to others after writing the\r\n_Electra_, and the _Troades_? Don't be idle; and don't think the\r\nproverbial γνῶθι σεαυτόν was only meant to discourage vanity: it means\r\nalso that we should be aware of our own qualities. But pray send me\r\nthese tragedies as well as the _Erigona_. I have now answered your last\r\ntwo letters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 669: B.C. 129.

The promenade of Crassipes has been washed\r\naway, pleasure grounds, a great number of shops. There is a great sheet\r\nof water right up to the public fish-pond. That doctrine of Homer's is\r\nin full play:\r\n\r\n    \"The days in autumn when in violent flood\r\n    Zeus pours his waters, wroth at sinful men\"--\r\n\r\nfor it falls in with the acquittal of Gabinius--\r\n\r\n    \"Who wrench the law to suit their crooked ends\r\n    And drive out justice, recking naught of Gods.\"[673]\r\n\r\nBut I have made up my mind not to care about such things. When I get\r\nback to Rome I will write and tell you my observations, and especially\r\nabout the dictatorship, and I will also send a letter to Labienus and\r\none to Ligurius. I write this before daybreak by the carved wood\r\nlamp-stand, in which I take great delight, because they tell me that you\r\nhad it made when you were at Samos.

For I believe you\r\nthought that your ladies were in Apulia, and when you find that not to\r\nbe the case, what can there be to detain you there?

It is exactly as if I\r\nwere the _imperator_. The choice was just lately offered him of\r\nselecting any of the winter quarters, as he writes me word. Wouldn't you\r\nbe fond of such a man as that? Of which of your friends would you, if\r\nnot of him? But look you! did I write you word that I was _legatus_ to\r\nPompey, and should be outside the city from the 13th of January onwards?\r\nThis appeared to me to square with many things. But why say more? I\r\nwill, I think, reserve the rest till we meet, that you may, after all,\r\nhave something to look forward to. My very best regards to Dionysius,\r\nfor whom, indeed, I have not merely kept a place, but have even built\r\none.

I will only give you this hint and make this\r\nrequest, that in the midst of your vexations and labours you should\r\nrecall what our notion was as to your going to Cæsar. For our object was\r\nnot the acquisition of certain small and unimportant gains. For what was\r\nthere of that kind which we should have thought worth the price of our\r\nseparation? What we sought was the strongest possible security for the\r\nmaintenance of our entire political position by the countenance of a man\r\nof the highest character and most commanding influence. Our interest is\r\nnot so much in the acquisition of sums of money, as in the realization\r\nof this hope: all else that you get is to be regarded only as a security\r\nagainst actual loss.[678] Wherefore, if you will frequently turn your\r\nthoughts back upon what we originally proposed to ourselves and hoped to\r\ndo, you will bear with less impatience the labours of military service\r\nof which you speak and the other things which annoy you, and,\r\nnevertheless, will resign them whenever you choose. But the right moment\r\nfor that step is not yet come, though it is now not far off.\r\nFarthermore, I give you this hint--don't commit anything at all to\r\nwriting, the publication of which would be annoying to us. There are\r\nmany things that I would rather not know than learn at some risk. I\r\nshall write at greater length to you with a mind less preoccupied, when\r\nmy boy Cicero is, as I hope he will be, in a good state of health. Pray\r\nbe careful to let me know to whom I should give the letter which I shall\r\nthen send you--to Cæsar's letter-carriers, for him to forward them\r\ndirect to you, or to those of Labienus? For where your Nervii dwell, and\r\nhow far off, I have no idea.[679] I derived great pleasure from your\r\nletter describing the courage and dignity displayed (as you say) by\r\nCæsar in his extreme sorrow. You bid me finish the poem in his honour\r\nwhich I had begun; and although I have been diverted from it by\r\nbusiness, and still more by my feelings, yet, since Cæsar knows that I\r\ndid begin something, I will return to my design, and will complete in\r\nthese leisure days of the \"supplications,\"[680] during which I greatly\r\nrejoice that our friend Messalla and the rest are at last relieved from\r\nworry. In reckoning on him as certain to be consul with Domitius, you\r\nare quite in agreement with my own opinion. I will guarantee Messalla to\r\nCæsar: but Memmius cherishes a hope, founded on Cæsar's return to Italy,\r\nin which I think he is under a mistake. He is, indeed, quite out of it\r\nhere. Scaurus, again, has been long ago thrown over by Pompey. The\r\nbusiness has been put off: the _comitia_ postponed and postponed, till\r\nwe may expect an _interregnum_. The rumour of a dictator is not pleasing\r\nto the aristocrats; for myself, I like still less what they say. But the\r\nproposal, as a whole, is looked upon with alarm, and grows unpopular.\r\nPompey says outright that he doesn't wish it: to me previously he used\r\nnot personally to deny the wish. Hirrus seems likely to be the proposer.\r\nYe gods! what folly! How in love with himself and without--a rival! He\r\nhas commissioned me to choke off Cælius Vinicianus, a man much attached\r\nto me. Whether Pompey wishes it or not, it is difficult to be sure.\r\nHowever, if it is Hirrus who makes the proposal, he will not convince\r\npeople that he does not wish it. There is nothing else being talked\r\nabout in politics just now; at any rate, nothing else is being done. The\r\nfuneral of the son of Serranus Domesticus took place in very melancholy\r\ncircumstances on the 23rd of November. His father delivered the funeral\r\noration which I composed for him. Now about Milo. Pompey gives him no\r\nsupport, and is all for Gutta, saying also that he will secure Cæsar on\r\nhis side. Milo is alarmed at this, and no wonder, and almost gives up\r\nhope if Pompey is created dictator. If he assists anyone who vetoes the\r\ndictatorship by his troop and bodyguard,[681] he fears he may excite\r\nPompey's enmity: if he doesn't do so, he fears the proposal may be\r\ncarried by force. He is preparing games on a most magnificent scale, at\r\na cost, I assure you, that no one has ever exceeded. It is foolish, on\r\ntwo or even three accounts, to give games that were not demanded--he has\r\nalready given a magnificent show of gladiators: he cannot afford it: he\r\nis only an executor, and might have reflected that he is now an\r\nexecutor, not an ædile. That is about all I had to write. Take care of\r\nyourself, dearest brother.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 678: Cicero means, \"the substantial gain to be got from your\r\nserving under Cæsar in Gaul is the securing of his protection in the\r\nfuture: all other gains, such as money etc., are merely to be regarded\r\nas securing you from immediate loss in thus going to Gaul: they don't\r\nadd anything fresh to our position and prospects.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 679: Quintus had his winter quarters among the Nervii, in a\r\ntown near the modern Charleroi. In this winter he was in great danger\r\nfrom a sudden rising of the Nervii and other tribes (Cæs. _B. G._ v.\r\n24-49).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 680: Twenty days of _supplicatio_ had been decreed in honour\r\nof Cæsar's campaigns of B.C. 55 (Cæs. _B. G._ iv. 38).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 681: His gladiators, which he kept in training for the games\r\nhe was going to give in honour of a deceased friend.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIX (Q FR III, 9)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL)\r\n\r\nROME (NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nIn regard to Gabinius, I had not to carry out any of the measures which\r\nyou suggested with such affectionate solicitude. \"May the earth swallow\r\nme rather, etc.!\"[682] I acted with very great dignity and also with the\r\ngreatest consideration. I neither bore hardly on him nor helped him. I\r\ngave strong evidence, in other respects I did not stir. The disgraceful\r\nand mischievous result of the trial I bore with the utmost serenity. And\r\nthis is the advantage which, after all that has happened, has accrued to\r\nme--that I am not even affected in the least by those evils in the state\r\nand the licentious conduct of the shameless, which used formerly to make\r\nme burst with indignation: for anything more abandoned than the men and\r\nthe times in which we are living there cannot be. Accordingly, as no\r\npleasure can possibly be got from politics, I don't know why I should\r\nlose my temper. Literature and my favourite studies, along with the\r\nretirement of my country houses, and above all our two boys, furnish my\r\nenjoyments. The one man who vexes me is Milo. But I hope an end will be\r\nput to my anxieties by his getting the consulship: and to obtain this\r\nfor him I shall struggle as hard as I did for my own, and you, I am\r\nsure, will continue to give assistance from over there. In his case\r\nother things are all secure, unless it is snatched from his grasp by\r\ndownright violence: it is about his means that I am frightened:\r\n\r\n    \"For he is now beyond all bearing mad,\"[683]\r\n\r\nto spend 1,000,000 sesterces (about £8,000) on his games. His want of\r\nprudence in this one particular I shall put up with as well as I can,\r\nand you should be strong-minded enough to do the same. In mentioning the\r\nchanges to be expected next year, I didn't mean you to understand me to\r\nrefer to domestic alarms: the reference was wholly to the state of the\r\nRepublic, in which, though not charged with any actual duty, I can\r\nscarcely discharge myself from all anxiety. Yet how cautious I would\r\nhave you be in writing you may guess from the fact that I do not mention\r\nin my letters to you even open acts of disorder in the state, lest my\r\nletter should be intercepted and give offence to the feelings of anyone.\r\nWherefore, as far as domestic affairs are concerned, I would have you be\r\nquite easy: in politics I know how anxious you always are. I can see\r\nthat our friend Messalla will be consul, if by means of an _interrex_,\r\nwithout any prosecution, if by that of a dictator, without danger of\r\nconviction. He is not disliked by anyone. Hortensius's warm support will\r\nstand him in good stead. Gabinius's acquittal is looked upon as a\r\ngeneral act of indemnity. _En passant_: nothing has, after all, been\r\ndone as yet about a dictatorship. Pompey is out of town; Appius is\r\nintriguing darkly; Hirrus is paving the way: there are many tribunes\r\ncalculated on to veto it: the people are indifferent: the leading men\r\ndisinclined to it: I don't stir a finger. I am exceedingly obliged for\r\nyour promises as to slaves, and I am indeed, as you say, short-handed\r\nboth at Rome and on my estates. But pray do nothing for my convenience\r\nunless it entirely suits your own, and your means. About the letter of\r\nVatinius I laughed heartily. But though I know I am being watched by\r\nhim, I can swallow his hatred and digest it too. You urge me to\r\n\"finish\": well, I have finished what, in my own opinion at least, is a\r\nvery pretty \"epic\" on Cæsar, but I am in search of a trustworthy\r\nletter-carrier, lest it should share the fate of your\r\n_Erigona_[684]--the only personage who has missed a safe journey from\r\nGaul during Cæsar's governorship.\r\n\r\nWhat? because I had no good stone was I to pull down the whole\r\nbuilding?--a building which I like better every day of my life: the\r\nlower court especially and the chambers attached to it are admirable. As\r\nto Arcanum, it is a building worthy of Cæsar, or, by heaven, of some one\r\neven more tasteful still. For your statues, _palæstra_, fish-pond, and\r\nconduit are worthy of many Philotimuses, and quite above your\r\nDiphiluses. But I will visit them personally, as well as sending men to\r\nlook after them and giving orders about them. As to the will of Felix,\r\nyou will complain more when you know all. For the document which he\r\nbelieved himself to have sealed, in which your name was most certainly\r\nentered as heir to a twelfth, this, by a mistake of his own and of his\r\nslave Sicura, he did not seal: while the one which he did not intend to\r\nseal he did seal. But let it go hang, so long as we keep well! I am as\r\ndevoted to your son Cicero as you can wish, and as he deserves, and as I\r\nam bound to be. However, I am letting him leave me, both to avoid\r\nkeeping him from his teachers, and because his mother is leaving,\r\nwithout whom I am very much alarmed as to the boy's large appetite. Yet,\r\nafter all, we see a great deal of each other. I have now answered all\r\nyour letters. Dearest and best of brothers, good-bye.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 682: _I.e._, rather than defend him. τότε μοι χάνοι (εὐρεῖα\r\nχθών), Hom. _Il._ iv. 182.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 683: ὁ δὲ μαίνεται οὐκ ἔτ' ἀνεκτῶς (Hom. _Il._ viii. 355).

TREBATIUS TESTA (IN GAUL)\r\n\r\nROME (NOVEMBER)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nI have read your letter which informs me that our Cæsar considers you a\r\ngreat lawyer. You must be glad to have found a country where you have\r\nthe credit of knowing something. But if you had gone to Britain also, I\r\nfeel sure that there would not have been in all that great island anyone\r\nmore learned in the law than you. However--you won't mind my laughing,\r\nfor you invited me to do so--I am becoming positively a little jealous\r\nof you! That you should have been actually sent for by a man whom other\r\npeople--not because of his pride, but of his many engagements--cannot\r\nventure to approach!\r\n\r\nBut in that letter you told me nothing about your success, which, by\r\nheaven, is of no less concern to me than my own. I am very much afraid\r\nyou may be frozen in your winter quarters: and therefore I think you\r\nought to use a good stove. Mucius and Manilius \"concur\" in this opinion,\r\nespecially on the ground of your being short of military cloaks.\r\nHowever, I am told that you are having a sufficiently warm time of it\r\nwhere you are--news which made me much alarmed for you.[685] However, in\r\nmilitary matters you are much more cautious than at the bar, seeing that\r\nyou wouldn't take a swim in the ocean, fond of swimming as you are, and\r\nwouldn't take a look at the British charioteers, though in old time I\r\ncould never cheat you even out of a blind-folded gladiator.[686] But\r\nenough of joking. You know how earnestly I have written to Cæsar about\r\nyou; I know how often. Yet, in truth, I have lately ceased doing so,\r\nlest I should appear to distrust the kindness of a man who has been most\r\nliberal and affectionate to me. However, in the very last letter I wrote\r\nI thought he ought to be reminded. I did so. Please tell me what effect\r\nit had, and at the same time tell me about your position in general and\r\nall your plans. For I am anxious to know what you are doing, what you\r\nare expecting, how long your separation from us you think is to last. I\r\nwould wish you to believe that the one consolation, enabling me to bear\r\nyour absence, is the knowledge that it is for your advantage. But if\r\nthat is not so, nothing can be more foolish than both the one and the\r\nother of us: me for not inducing you to come back to Rome--you for not\r\nflying thither. By heavens, our conversation, whether serious or\r\njesting, will be worth more not only than the enemy, but even than our\r\n\"brothers\" the Hædui.[687] Wherefore let me know about everything as\r\nsoon as possible:\r\n\r\n    \"I'll be some use by comfort, rede, or pelf.\"[688]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 685: He seems to refer to the rising of the Nervii against the\r\nRoman winter quarters (Cæs. _B.

VALERIUS (IN CILICIA)\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nM. Cicero wishes heath to L. Valerius, learned in the law. For why I\r\nshould not pay you this compliment I don't know, especially considering\r\nthat in these times one may employ impudence to supply the place of\r\nlearning. I have written to our friend Lentulus, thanking him earnestly\r\nin your name. But I could wish that you would now cease using my letter\r\nof introduction and at last come back to us, and prefer a city where you\r\nare of some account, to a place where you appear to be the only man of\r\nlegal learning. However, those who come from where you are either say\r\nyou are proud because you give no \"opinions,\" or insulting because you\r\ngive bad ones.[689] But I am now longing to crack a joke with you face\r\nto face. So come as soon as ever you can, and don't go and visit your\r\nnative Apulia, that we may have the joy of welcoming your safe return.\r\nFor if you go there, like another Ulysses, you will not recognize any of\r\nyour friends.[690]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 689: Cicero perhaps means that Valerius's \"opinions\" are too\r\nright to suit such a set as are to be found in the province. Valerius\r\nwill not mind people there thinking him a bad lawyer. \"At Rome you are\r\nconsidered a good lawyer, in Cilicia they don't think so!\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 690: _Cognosces tuorum neminem._. Others read _cognoscere\r\ntuorum nemini_, \"you will not be recognized by any of your friends,\"\r\nwhich agrees better with Homer's account of the return of Ulysses. But\r\nperhaps the exact comparison is not to be pressed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLXII (F XIII, 49)\r\n\r\nTO M. CURIUS (A PROCONSUL)\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nQ. Pompeius, son of Sextus, has become my intimate friend from many\r\ncauses of long standing. As he has often in the past been accustomed to\r\ndefend his material interests, as well as his reputation and influence,\r\nby my recommendations, so on the present occasion assuredly, with you as\r\ngovernor of the province, he ought to be able to feel that he has never\r\nhad a warmer recommendation to anyone. Wherefore I beg you with more\r\nthan ordinary earnestness that, as you ought in view of our close\r\nfriendship to regard all my friends as your own, you would give the\r\nbearer so high a place in your regard, that he may feel that nothing\r\ncould have been more to his interest and honour than my recommendation.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLXIII (F XIII, 60)\r\n\r\nTO C. MUNATIUS (IN A PROVINCE)\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nL. Livineius Trypho is to begin with a freedman of my most intimate\r\nfriend L. Regulus (whose disaster makes me more than ever anxious to do\r\nhim some service--for as far as feeling goes I could not be warmer): but\r\nI also am attached to his freedman on his own account, for he shewed me\r\nvery great kindness at that time in my career, when I was best able to\r\nsee men's real goodwill and fidelity. I recommend him to you with all\r\nthe warmth that one who is grateful and not oblivious should use in\r\nrecommending those who have done him good service. You will have greatly\r\ngratified me if he is made to feel that in confronting many dangers for\r\nmy security, and often undertaking voyages in the depths of winter, he\r\nhas also put you under an obligation in view of your kind feeling\r\ntowards me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLXIV (F XIII, 73)\r\n\r\nTO Q. PHILIPPUS (PROCONSUL OF ASIA)\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 54, ÆT. 52]\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on your safe return to your family from your\r\nprovince, without loss to your reputation or to the state. But if I had\r\nseen you at Rome I should also have thanked you for having looked after\r\nL. Egnatius, my most intimate friend, who is still absent, and L.\r\nOppius, who is here. With Antipater of Derbe I have become not merely on\r\nvisiting terms, but really very intimate. I have been told that you are\r\nexceedingly angry with him, and I was very sorry to hear it. I have no\r\nmeans of judging the merits of the case, only I am persuaded that a man\r\nof your character has done nothing without good reason. However, I do\r\nbeg of you again and again that, in consideration of our old friendship,\r\nyou will, for my sake if for anyone's, grant his sons, who are in your\r\npower, their liberty, unless you consider that in doing so your\r\nreputation may be injured. If I had thought that, I would never have\r\nmade the request, for your fame is of more importance in my eyes than\r\nany friendship with him. But I persuade myself--though I may possibly be\r\nmistaken--that this measure will bring you honour rather than abuse.\r\nWhat can be done in the matter, and what you _can_ do for my sake (for\r\nas to your willingness I feel no doubt), I should be obliged by your\r\ninforming me, if it is not too much trouble to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLXV (F II, 1)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 53, Coss., M. Domitius Calvinus, M. Valerius Messalla.]\r\n\r\n     This was the year in which Crassus was defeated and killed in\r\n     Parthia, making thus the first break in the triumvirate, when\r\n     already the ties between Pompey and Cæsar were weakened by the\r\n     death of Iulia in the previous year. Cæsar, however, had been in\r\n     great difficulties in Gaul. At the end of the previous year a fresh\r\n     rising of the Nervii destroyed a Roman legion and put Q. Cicero in\r\n     great danger. In the present year Quintus met with his disaster at\r\n     the hands of the Sigambri. The chief event to Cicero personally was\r\n     his election into the college of augurs, in place of the younger\r\n     Crassus. Atticus appears to be in Rome, for there are no letters to\r\n     him. There was a series of _interregna_ this year owing to partisan\r\n     conflicts, lasting till July, and when the consuls were at length\r\n     appointed, they failed to hold the elections for B.C. 52.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO C. SCRIBONIUS CURIO[691] (IN ASIA)\r\n\r\nROME (JANUARY OR FEBRUARY)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 53, ÆT. 53]\r\n\r\nThough I am sorry that you have suspected me of neglect, yet it was not\r\nso annoying to me to have my lack of attention found fault with, as\r\ndelightful to have it missed by you; especially as in the particular\r\npoint on which you accuse me I happen to be innocent, while in shewing\r\nthat you miss a letter from me, you avow an affection for me, of which,\r\nindeed, I was fully aware, but which, nevertheless, is very soothing and\r\ngratifying to my feelings. The fact is that I have never let anyone go,\r\nso long, that is, as I thought him likely to reach you, without giving\r\nhim a letter. Why, was there ever such an untiring correspondent as I?\r\nFrom you, however, I have received two, or at the most three\r\nletters--and those extremely brief. Wherefore, if you are a harsh judge\r\nof me, I shall find you guilty on precisely the same charge. But if you\r\ndon't want me to do that, you will have to be considerate to me.\r\nHowever, enough about writing; for I am not afraid of failing to satiate\r\nyou with my correspondence, especially if you shew a just appreciation\r\nof my zeal in that department. I have been grieved on the one hand at\r\nyour long absence from us, because I have lost the advantage of a most\r\ndelightful intimacy; and yet on the other hand I rejoice at it, because\r\nwhile on this foreign service you have gained all your objects with\r\ninfinite credit to yourself, and because in all you have undertaken\r\nfortune has answered to my wishes. There is one injunction, a very short\r\none, which my unspeakable affection for you compels me to give you. Such\r\nlofty expectations are entertained of your spirit, shall I say? or of\r\nyour ability, that I cannot refrain from imploring and beseeching you to\r\nreturn to us with a character so finished, as to be able to support and\r\nmaintain the expectations which you have excited. And since no loss of\r\nmemory will ever obliterate my recollection of your services to me, I\r\nbeg you not to forget that, whatever increase of fortune or position may\r\nbefall you, you would not have been able to attain it, had you not as a\r\nboy obeyed my most faithful and affectionate counsels.[692] Wherefore it\r\nwill be your duty to shew me such affection, that my age--now on the\r\ndecline--may find repose in your devotion and youth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 691: The younger Curio was now quæstor to C.

I shall\r\nadvise all defendants in civil suits to ask each _interrex_ for two\r\nadjournments for obtaining legal assistance.[693] Do you think that I\r\nhave taken a pretty good hint from you as to civil procedure? But come!\r\nHow are you? What is happening? For I notice in your letter a tendency\r\nto be even jocose. These are better signs than the _signa_ in my\r\nTusculan villa.[694] But I want to know what it means. You say, indeed,\r\nthat you are consulted by Cæsar, but I should have preferred his\r\nconsulting _for_ you. If that is taking place, or you think it likely to\r\ntake place, by all means persevere in your military service and stay on:\r\nI shall console myself for my loss of you by the hope that it will be\r\nyour gain: but if, on the other hand, things are not paying with you,\r\ncome back to us. For either something will turn up sooner or later here,\r\nor, if not, one conversation between you and me, by heaven, will be\r\nworth more than all the Samobrivæ[695] in the world. Finally, if you\r\nreturn speedily, there will be no talk about it; but if you stay away\r\nmuch longer without getting anything, I am in terror not only of\r\nLaberius, but of our comrade Valerius also. For it would make a capital\r\ncharacter for a farce--a British lawyer![696] I am not laughing though\r\nyou may laugh, but, as usual, when writing to you, I jest on the most\r\nserious subject. Joking apart, I advise you in the most friendly spirit,\r\nthat if you hold a position for yourself worthy of my introduction, you\r\nshould put up with the loss of my society and farther your own career\r\nand wealth: but if things are stagnant with you there, come back to us.\r\nIn spite of everything you will get all you want, by your own good\r\nqualities certainly, but also by my extreme affection for you.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 693: The _interregna_ lasting this year till July.

What a\r\nwonderful camp yours must be! What would you have done if I had sent you\r\nto Tarentum[699] instead of Samobriva? I was already a little doubtful\r\nabout you, when I found you supporting the same doctrine as my friend\r\nSelius![700] But on what ground will you support the principles of civil\r\nlaw, if you act always in your own interest and not in that of your\r\nfellow citizens? What, too, is to become of the legal formula in cases\r\nof trust, \"as should be done among honest men\"? For who can be called\r\nhonest who does nothing except on his own behalf? What principle will\r\nyou lay down \"in dividing a common property,\" when nothing can be\r\n\"common\" among men who measure all things by their own pleasure?[701]\r\nHow, again, can you ever think it right to swear by _Iupiter lapis_,\r\nwhen you know that Iupiter cannot be angry with anyone?[702] What is to\r\nbecome of the people of Ulubræ,[703] if you have decided that it is not\r\nright to take part in civic business? Wherefore, if you are really and\r\ntruly a pervert from our faith, I am much annoyed; but if you merely\r\nfind it convenient to humour Pansa, I forgive you. Only _do_ write and\r\ntell us how you are, and what you want me to do or to look after for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 698: C.

The logical deduction that a man should therefore hold aloof\r\nfrom politics and social life, as involving social obligations and\r\nstandards, was, of course, evaded in practice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 702: For the Epicureans believed the gods to exist, but not to\r\ntrouble themselves with the affairs of men.

But to\r\nreturn to our subject--I am exceedingly glad that you are content to be\r\nwhere you are, and as your former state of mind was vexatious, so your\r\npresent is gratifying, to me. I am only afraid that your special\r\nprofession may be of little advantage to you: for, as I am told, in your\r\npresent abode\r\n\r\n    \"They lay no claim by joining lawful hands,\r\n    But challenge right with steel.\"[705]\r\n\r\nBut you are not wont[706] to be called in to assist at a \"forcible\r\nentry.\" Nor have you any reason to be afraid of the usual proviso in the\r\ninjunction, \"into which you have not previously made entry by force and\r\narmed men,\" for I am well assured that you are not a man of violence.\r\nBut to give you some hint as to what you lawyers call \"securities,\" I\r\nopine that you should avoid the Treviri; I hear they are real _tresviri\r\ncapitales_--deadly customers: I should have preferred their being\r\n_tresviri_ of the mint![707] But a truce to jesting for the present.\r\nPray write to me in the fullest detail of all that concerns you.\r\n\r\n4 March.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 704:\r\n\r\n    \"I will make fast the doors and _gild_ myself\r\n    With some more ducats.\"--SHAKESPEARE..\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 705: Ennius, _Ann._ 275.

TREBATIUS TESTA (IN GAUL)\r\n\r\nA VILLA IN THE AGER POMPTINUS, 8 APRIL\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 53, ÆT. 53]\r\n\r\nI have received several letters from you at the same time, written at\r\nvarious times, in which everything else gave me great pleasure; for they\r\nshewed that you were now sustaining your military service with a brave\r\nspirit, and were a gallant and resolute man. These are qualities which\r\nfor a short time I felt to be lacking in you, though I attributed your\r\nuneasiness not so much to any weakness of your own spirit, as to your\r\nfeeling your absence from us. Therefore go on as you have begun: endure\r\nyour service with a stout heart: believe me, the advantages you will\r\ngain are many; for I will reiterate my recommendation of you, though I\r\nshall wait for the right moment of doing so. Be assured that you are not\r\nmore anxious that your separation from me should be as profitable as\r\npossible to yourself than I am. Accordingly, as your \"securities\" are\r\nsomewhat weak, I have sent you one in my poor Greek, written by my own\r\nhand.[708] For your part, I should wish you to keep me informed of the\r\ncourse of the war in Gaul: for the less warlike my informant, the more\r\ninclined I am to believe him.\r\n\r\nBut to return to your letters. Everything else (as I said) is prettily\r\nwritten, but I do wonder at this: who in the world sends several\r\nidentical letters, when he writes them with his own hand? For your\r\nwriting on paper that has been used before, I commend your economy: but\r\nI can't help wondering what it was that you preferred to rub out of this\r\nbit of paper rather than not write such poor stuff as this--unless it\r\nwere, perhaps, some of your legal formulas. For I don't suppose you rub\r\nout my letters to replace them with your own. Can it mean that there is\r\nno business going on, that you are out of work, that you haven't even a\r\nsupply of paper? Well, that is entirely your own fault, for taking your\r\nmodesty abroad with you instead of leaving it behind here with us. I\r\nwill commend you to Balbus, when he starts to join you, in the good old\r\nRoman style. Don't be astonished if there is a somewhat longer interval\r\nthan usual between my letters: for I intend being out of town in April.\r\nI write this letter in the Pomptine district, having put up at the villa\r\nof M. Æmilius Philemo, from which I could hear the noise of my clients,\r\nI mean those you confided to me! For at Ulubræ it is certain that an\r\nenormous mass of frogs have bestirred themselves to do me honour. Take\r\ncare of your health.[709]\r\n\r\n8 April, from the Ager Pomptinus.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Your letter which I received from L. Arruntius I have torn up,\r\nthough it didn't deserve it; for it had nothing in it which might not\r\nhave been safely read in a public meeting. But not only did Arruntius\r\nsay that such were your orders, but you had appended a similar\r\ninjunction to your letter. Well, be it so! I am surprised at your not\r\nhaving written anything to me since, especially as you are in the midst\r\nof such stirring events.[710]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 708: _Græculam tibi misi cautionem chirographi mei._ Various\r\ninterpretations have been given to this: (1) \"a truly Greek security,\"\r\n_i.e._, \"not to be depended on\"; (2) referring to a poem in Greek,\r\nperhaps the one in praise of Cæsar's achievements, mentioned before (p.\r\n338), in which some compliment to Trebatius was introduced; (3) Prof.\r\nTyrrell would make it refer to this letter itself, which he supposes to\r\nhave been written in Greek, and afterwards translated by Tiro. But this\r\nletter does not read like a translation, and, after all, is not of a\r\nnature to shew as a \"commendation.\" It is conceived in too jocular a\r\nvein. I have taken it to refer to some inclosure written in Greek which\r\nhe might use in this way, and the mention of his \"own handwriting\" to\r\nrefer to the fact that he would naturally have employed a Greek\r\nsecretary to write Greek. The diminutive _Græculam_ I take to be\r\napologetic for the Greek. But it is not at all certain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 709: On his journey along the _via Appia_ to one of his\r\nseaside villas Cicero has put up at a friend's house (a freedman of\r\nLepidus), near the Pomptine marshes, as was his wont (_Att._ vii. 5).

But, after all, I prefer enduring your absence to your not\r\ngetting what I hope for you.

You, however,\r\ncertainly don't expect a letter of that kind from me. For of your\r\ndomestic concerns you have members of your family both to write and to\r\nact as messengers. Besides, in my personal affairs there is really\r\nnothing new. There are two other kinds of letters which give me great\r\npleasure: the familiar and sportive, and the grave and serious. Which of\r\nthese two I ought least to employ I do not understand. Am I to jest with\r\nyou by letter? Upon my word, I don't think the man a good citizen who\r\ncould laugh in times like these. Shall I write in a more serious style?\r\nWhat could be written of seriously by Cicero to Curio except public\r\naffairs? And yet, under this head, my position is such that I neither\r\ndare write what I think, nor choose to write what I don't think.\r\nWherefore, since I have no subject left to write about, I will employ my\r\ncustomary phrase, and exhort you to the pursuit of the noblest glory.\r\nFor you have a dangerous rival already in the field, and fully prepared,\r\nin the extraordinary expectation formed of you; and this rival you will\r\nvanquish with the greatest ease, only on one condition--that you make up\r\nyour mind to put out your full strength in the cultivation of those\r\nqualities, by which the noble actions are accomplished, upon the glory\r\nof which you have set your heart. In support of this sentiment I would\r\nhave written at greater length had not I felt certain that you were\r\nsufficiently alive to it of your own accord; and I have touched upon it\r\neven thus far, not in order to fire your ambition, but to testify my\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 711: The friendship between Trebatius and Matius remained as\r\nlong as we know anything about them.

And though,\r\nwherever you are, as I have told you before, you are in the same boat,\r\nyet I congratulate you on your absence, as well because you don't see\r\nwhat we see, as because your reputation is placed on a lofty and\r\nconspicuous pinnacle in the sight of multitudes both of citizens and\r\nallies; and it is conveyed to us by neither obscure nor uncertain talk,\r\nbut by the loud and unanimous voice of all. There is one thing of which\r\nI cannot feel certain--whether to congratulate you, or to be alarmed for\r\nyou on account of the surprising expectation entertained of your return;\r\nnot because I am at all afraid of your not satisfying the world's\r\nopinion, but, by heaven, lest, when you do come, there may be nothing\r\nfor you to preserve: so universal is the decline and almost extinction\r\nof all our institutions. But even thus much I am afraid I have been rash\r\nto trust to a letter: wherefore you shall learn the rest from\r\nothers.[712] However, whether you have still some hope of the Republic,\r\nor have given it up in despair, see that you have ready, rehearsed and\r\nthought out in your mind, all that the citizen and the man should have\r\nat his command who is destined to restore to its ancient dignity and\r\nfreedom a state crushed and overwhelmed by evil times and profligate\r\nmorals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 712: In these vague though ominous sentences Cicero is\r\nreferring to the constant and violent hindrances to the election of\r\nmagistrates, that is, to the orderly working of the constitution, which\r\nwere occurring.

JULY)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 53, ÆT. 53]\r\n\r\nNews had not yet reached me of your arrival in Italy when I sent Sext.\r\nVillius, an intimate of my friend Milo, with this letter to you. But\r\nnevertheless, since your arrival was thought to be approaching, and it\r\nwas ascertained that you had already started from Asia Rome-wards, the\r\nimportance of my subject made me dismiss any fear of being premature in\r\nsending you this letter, for I was exceedingly anxious that it should\r\nreach you as soon as possible. If the obligations, Curio, had only been\r\non your side, and as great as they are usually proclaimed by you rather\r\nthan as valued by me, I should have been more shy of coming to you for\r\nany request of importance which I might have to make. For it is very\r\ndisagreeable to a modest man to ask a great favour from one whom he\r\nthinks under an obligation to himself, lest he should seem rather to\r\ndemand than to ask what he is seeking, and to regard it more in the\r\nlight of a debt than of a favour. But since your kindnesses to me were\r\nknown to the whole world, or rather I should say were made especially\r\nprominent and valuable by the very novelty of my circumstances; and\r\nsince it is the mark of a generous heart to be willing, when much is\r\nowed, to reckon the debt at its highest; I did not hesitate to prefer\r\nto you by letter a petition for what was of the highest importance and\r\nmost vital consequence to me of anything in the world. For I was not\r\nafraid of being unable to support your kindnesses to me, even though\r\nthey were beyond calculation: especially as I felt confident that there\r\nwas no amount of favour for which my heart was incapable of finding room\r\nwhen receiving it, or for which in repayment it could not make a full\r\nand brilliant return. I have concentrated and embarked all my zeal, all\r\nmy efforts, all the care and industry of which I am capable, my every\r\nthought, in fact, my whole heart and soul, on securing Milo's\r\nconsulship; and I have made up my mind that in this matter I ought to\r\nlook not merely for the profit arising from an act of kindness, but also\r\nfor the credit of disinterested affection. Nor do I think that anyone\r\nwas ever so anxious about his own personal safety and his own fortunes\r\nas I am for his election, on which I have made up my mind that all my\r\ninterests depend. To him I see clearly that, if you choose, you can\r\nrender such substantial help that we need ask for nothing else. We have\r\non our side all these advantages: the favour of the loyalists won since\r\nhis tribunate on account of his supporting me (as I hope you\r\nunderstand); that of the common multitude on account of the splendour of\r\nhis gladiatorial exhibitions and the liberality of his disposition; the\r\nfavour of the young men and of those influential in securing votes, won\r\nby his own eminent powers of captivation, shall I call it? or his\r\ndiligence in that department; lastly, my own electoral support, which,\r\nif it is not very powerful, is at any rate regarded as only right, due\r\nand proper, and on that account is perhaps influential also. What we\r\nwant is a leader, and what I may call a controller, or, so to speak, a\r\npilot of those winds which I have described: and if we had to select one\r\nsuch out of the whole world, we should have no one to compare with you.\r\nWherefore, if (as I am sure you can) you can regard me as a grateful, as\r\nan honest man, from the mere fact that I am thus eagerly exerting myself\r\nfor Milo, if, in fine, you think me worthy of your kindness, I do ask\r\nyou this favour--that you come to the rescue of this anxiety of mine and\r\nthis crisis in my reputation, or, to put it with greater truth, that you\r\nwill devote your zeal to what is all but a question of life and death to\r\nme. As to Titus Annius[713] himself, I promise you this much--that if\r\nyou resolve to embrace his cause, you will never have anyone of greater\r\nspirit, solidity, firmness, or affection to yourself. While to me you\r\nwill have given so much additional honour and prestige, that I shall\r\nhave no difficulty in acknowledging you to have been as effective in\r\nsupporting my reputation as you were in securing my safety.\r\n\r\nDid I not know that you must be fully aware, while writing this letter\r\nto you, under what a weight of obligation I am labouring, how strongly I\r\nam bound to work in this election for Milo, not only with every kind of\r\nexertion, but even with downright fighting, I should have written at\r\ngreater length. As it is, I hand over and commit the business, the\r\ncause, and myself wholly and entirely into your hands. Of one thing be\r\nsure: if I obtain this help from you, I shall owe you almost more than I\r\nowe Milo himself; for my personal safety, in which I have been\r\nconspicuously aided by him, has not been as dear to me as the sacred\r\nduty of returning the favour will be delightful. That object I feel\r\nconfident that your aid, and yours alone, will enable me to secure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 713: Milo. His full name is T. Annius Milo Papianus;\r\noriginally of the _gens Papia_, he had been adopted by his maternal\r\ngrandfather, T. Annius.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLXXVII (F XIII, 75)\r\n\r\n\r\nTO TITUS TITIUS, A LEGATUS[714]\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 53, ÆT. 53]\r\n\r\nThough I have no doubt that my first introduction retains its full value\r\nin your eyes, I yet yield to the request of a man with whom I am very\r\nintimate, C. Avianius Flaccus, for whose sake I not only desire, but am\r\nin duty bound to secure every possible favour. In regard to him I both\r\nspoke earnestly to you in a personal interview--on which occasion you\r\nanswered me with the greatest kindness--and have written with full\r\nparticulars to you on a previous occasion; but he thinks it to his\r\ninterest that I should write to you as often as possible. Wherefore I\r\nwould have you pardon me if, in compliance with his wishes, I shall\r\nappear to be at all forgetful of the stability of your character. What I\r\nbeg of you is this--that you would accommodate Avianius as to the place\r\nand time for landing his corn: for which he obtained by my influence a\r\nthree years' licence whilst Pompey was at the head of that business. The\r\nchief thing is--and you can therein lay me under the greatest\r\nobligation--that you should have convinced Avianius that I enjoy your\r\naffection, since he thinks himself secure of mine. You will greatly\r\noblige me by doing this.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 714: Pompey was _præfectus annonæ_ B.C. 57-52. As such he had\r\na number of _legati_, of whom this Titus Titius was one; but there is\r\nnothing to shew in which of the corn-supplying countries he was\r\nemployed. Avianius is a corn merchant, and wants concessions as to the\r\nimportation of his cargoes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLXXVIII (F V, 17)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 52. Coss., from V. Kal, Mart., Cn. Pompeius Magnus\r\n(alone); from 1st August, with Q. Metellus Scipio.]\r\n\r\n     This year again, owing to the riots in the previous year excited by\r\n     Clodius to prevent the election of Milo, began with a series of\r\n     _interregna_ lasting nearly three months, January, February, and\r\n     the intercalary month. On the 17th of January Clodius was killed\r\n     near Bovillæ by Milo's servants, and by his order. Riots followed\r\n     in Rome, the body was burnt in the Curia, which caught fire and was\r\n     destroyed. Cicero undertook Milo's defence under a new law _de vi_\r\n     brought in by Pompey, but broke down, and Milo was condemned\r\n     (April). Later in the year he successfully prosecuted T. Munatius\r\n     Plancus Bursa, who as tribune had promoted the riots after the\r\n     death of Clodius, and who had also supported the plan of making\r\n     Pompey dictator.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO P. SITTIUS[715] (IN EXILE)\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 52, ÆT. 54]\r\n\r\nIt was not because I had forgotten our friendship, or had any intention\r\nof breaking off my correspondence, that I have not written to you of\r\nlate years. The reason is that the earlier part of them was a period of\r\ndepression owing to the disaster which had befallen the Republic and\r\nmyself, while the later period, with your own most distressing and\r\nundeserved misfortune, has made me reluctant to write. Since, however, a\r\nsufficiently long period has now elapsed, and I have recalled with\r\ngreater distinctness your high character and lofty courage, I thought it\r\nnot inconsistent with my purposes to write this to you. For my part, my\r\ndear P. Sittius, I defended you originally, when an attempt was made in\r\nyour absence to bring you into odium and under a criminal charge; and\r\nwhen a charge against you was involved in the accusation and trial of\r\nyour most intimate friend,[716] I took the very greatest care to\r\nsafeguard your position and justify you. And, again also, on this last\r\noccasion, soon after my return to Rome, though I found that your case\r\nhad been put on a footing far different from what I should have advised,\r\nif I had been there, still I omitted nothing that could contribute to\r\nyour security. And though on that occasion the ill-feeling arising from\r\nthe price of corn, the hostility of certain persons, not only to\r\nyourself, but to all your friends as well, the unfairness of the whole\r\ntrial, and many other abuses in the state, had greater influence than\r\nthe merits of your case or than truth itself, I yet did not fail to\r\nserve your son Publius with active assistance, advice, personal\r\ninfluence, and direct testimony. Wherefore, as I have carefully and\r\nreligiously fulfilled all the other offices of friendship, I thought I\r\nought not to omit that of urging upon you and beseeching you to remember\r\nthat you are a human being and a gallant man--that is, that you should\r\nbear philosophically accidents which are common to all and incalculable,\r\nwhich none of us mortals can shun or forestall by any means whatever:\r\nshould confront with courage such grief as fortune brings: and should\r\nreflect that not in our state alone, but in all others that have\r\nacquired an empire, such disasters have in many instances befallen the\r\nbravest and best from unjust verdicts. Oh that I were writing untruly\r\nwhen I say, that you are exiled from a state in which no man of\r\nforesight can find anything to give him pleasure! As for your son,\r\nagain, I fear that, if I write nothing to you, I may seem not to have\r\nborne testimony to his high qualities as they deserve; while on the\r\nother hand, if I write fully all I feel, I fear that my letter may\r\nirritate the smart of your regret. But, after all, your wisest course\r\nwill be to regard his loyalty, virtue, and steady conduct as being in\r\nyour possession, and as accompanying you wherever you may be: for, in\r\ntruth, what we embrace in imagination is no less ours than what we see\r\nbefore our eyes. Wherefore not only ought his brilliant qualities and\r\nextreme affection for you afford you great consolation, but so also\r\nought I and others of your friends who value you, and always will do so,\r\nnot for your position, but your worth; and so, above all else, ought\r\nyour own conscience, when you reflect that you have not deserved\r\nanything that has befallen you, and when you consider besides that the\r\nwise are distressed by guilt, not by mischance--by their own ill-doing,\r\nnot by the misconduct of others. For my part, I shall omit no\r\nopportunity either of consoling or alleviating your present position;\r\nfor the recollection of our old friendship, and the high character and\r\nrespectful attentions of your son, will keep me in mind of that duty. If\r\nyou, on your part, will mention by letter anything you want, I will take\r\ncare that you shall not think that you have written in vain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 715: The letter in some MSS. is inscribed to Sextius or\r\nSestius. Of P. Sittius of Nuceria we hear in the speech _pro Sulla_, §§\r\n56, 58. Sulla (who was accused of assisting Catiline) had sent P.\r\nSittius on a mission to Spain, as it was alleged, to raise a rebellion\r\nthere in support of Catiline. It does not, however, appear that his\r\ncondemnation took place then. It seems to have been just previous to\r\nCicero's return from exile (August, B.C. 57), and it is suggested that\r\nit was after his ædileship of the previous year, when a scarcity of corn\r\nhad contributed to his unpopularity. The date of the letter is\r\nuncertain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 716: P. Sulla. Sittius was not, it seems, brought to trial\r\nwith Sulla, but his journey to Spain formed part of the allegations\r\nagainst Sulla.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLXXIX (F V, 18)\r\n\r\nTO T. FADIUS[717] (IN EXILE)\r\n\r\nROME\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 52, ÆT. 54]\r\n\r\nAlthough I too, who am desirous of consoling you, stand in need of\r\nconsolation myself--for nothing for a long time past has so deeply\r\nafflicted me as your disaster--nevertheless I do strongly not only\r\nexhort, but even beg and implore you, with all the earnestness that my\r\naffection dictates, to summon all your energies, to shew a manly\r\ncourage, and to reflect under what conditions all mortals, and in what\r\ntimes we particularly, have been born. Your virtue has given you more\r\nthan fortune has taken away: for you have obtained what not many \"new\r\nmen\" have obtained; you have lost what many men of the highest rank have\r\nlost. Finally, a state of legislation, law courts, and politics\r\ngenerally appears to be imminent, such that the man would seem to be the\r\nmost fortunate who has quitted such a republic as ours with the lightest\r\npossible penalty. As for you, however--since you retain your fortune and\r\nchildren, with myself and others still very closely united to you,\r\nwhether by relationship or affection--and since you are likely to have\r\nmuch opportunity of living with me and all your friends--and since,\r\nagain, your condemnation is the only one out of so many that is\r\nimpugned, because, having been passed by one vote (and that a doubtful\r\none), it is regarded as a concession to a particular person's\r\noverwhelming[718] power--for all these reasons, I say, you ought to be\r\nas little distressed as possible at the inconvenience that has befallen\r\nyou. My feeling towards yourself and your children will always be such\r\nas you wish, and such as it is in duty bound to be.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 717: Titus Fadius Gallus had been a quæstor in Cicero's\r\nconsulship (B.C. 63), and a tribune in B.C. 58, when Cicero reckoned him\r\namong those on whom he depended to resist Clodius. He also, among\r\nothers, had a motion prepared for Cicero's recall, of which Cicero\r\nspeaks with approbation (p. 178). We do not know on what charge he had\r\nbeen condemned, but a number of prosecutions followed the death of\r\nClodius and Pompey's legislation as to violence and corruption of\r\njuries.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 718: Pompey.

Could the Republic itself speak and tell\r\nyou of its state, you would not learn it more easily from its own lips\r\nthan from your freedman Phania: he is a man of such clear insight, as\r\nwell as (in a good sense) of such keen curiosity! Wherefore he shall\r\nexplain everything to you: for that will suit me best by enabling me to\r\ncurtail my letter, and will be more prudent for me in view of other\r\ncircumstances. But in regard to my good feeling towards you, though you\r\ncan learn it from this same Phania, yet I think that I also have\r\npersonally something I ought to say on the subject. For assure yourself\r\nof this--that you are exceedingly dear to me, from the many attractions\r\nof your character, your kindness, and the goodness of your heart, but\r\nalso because from your letter, as well as from the remarks of many, I\r\nunderstand that all my conduct towards you has been most warmly\r\nappreciated by you. And since that is so, I will take means to make up\r\nfor the great loss of time, which we have sustained from this\r\ninterruption of our intercourse, by the liberality, the frequency, and\r\nthe importance of my services; and that I think I shall do, since you\r\nwould have it be so, by no means against the grain, or as the phrase is,\r\n\"against the will of Minerva\"--a goddess by the way whom, if I shall\r\nchance to get possession of a statue of her from your stock, I shall not\r\nsimply designate \"Pallas,\" but \"Appias.\"[720] Your freedman Cilix was\r\nnot well known to me before, but when he delivered me your kind and\r\naffectionate letter, he confirmed the courteous expressions of that\r\nletter by his own words. I was much gratified by his speech, when he\r\ndescribed to me your feelings and the remarks which you were daily\r\nmaking about me. In short, within two days he became my intimate friend,\r\nwithout, however, my ceasing to regret Phania deeply. When you send the\r\nlatter back to Rome, which I imagine you intend speedily to do, pray\r\ngive him instructions as to all matters which you wish to be transacted\r\nor looked after by me.\r\n\r\nI commend L. Valerius the lawyer to you very strongly; not, however, in\r\nhis capacity of lawyer: for I wish to take better precautions for him\r\nthan he does for others. I am really fond of the man: he is one of my\r\nclosest and most intimate friends. In a general way he expresses nothing\r\nbut gratitude to you; but he also says that a letter from me will have\r\nvery great influence with you. I beg you again and again that he may not\r\nfind himself mistaken.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 719: Brother of Cicero's enemy, P. Clodius. He had been consul\r\nin B.C. 54, and was now proconsul in Cilicia, in which government Cicero\r\nwas to succeed him. His relations with Cicero had been varied, and\r\nthough Cicero speaks warmly to him, he does not do so often of him, and\r\nhis compliments are evidently not really sincere.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 720: \"I shall, in compliment to your accomplishments, call the\r\ngoddess of learning and wisdom 'Appias,'\" _i.e._, the \"Appian Goddess.\"\r\nBut the meaning of the elaborate and dull joke or compliment is far from\r\nclear, especially the phrase _si forte de tuis sumpsero_. Was Cicero\r\nexpecting a present of a bust of Minerva, or intending to purchase one\r\nfrom Appius's collection? Or does he allude, as has been suggested, to\r\nthe Minerva he had himself dedicated before his exile, and which had\r\nprobably fallen into the hands of the Appian family?]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLXXXI (F VII, 2)\r\n\r\nTO M. MARIUS (IN CAMPANIA)\r\n\r\nROME (DECEMBER)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 52, ÆT. 54]\r\n\r\nI will look after your commission carefully. But, sharp man that you\r\nare, you have given your commission to the very person above all others\r\nwhose interest it is that the article should fetch the highest possible\r\nprice! However, you have been far-sighted in fixing beforehand how far I\r\nam to go. But if you had left it to me, I am so much attached to you\r\nthat I would have made a bargain with the heirs: as it is, since I know\r\nyour price, I will put up some one to bid rather than let it go for\r\nless. But a truce to jesting! I will do your business with all care, as\r\nin duty bound. I feel sure you are glad about Bursa[721], but your\r\ncongratulations are too half-hearted. For you suppose, as you say in\r\nyour letter, that, owing to the fellow's meanness, I don't look upon it\r\nas a matter of much rejoicing. I would have you believe that I am more\r\npleased with this verdict than with the death of my enemy. For, in the\r\nfirst place, I would rather win by legal process than by the sword; in\r\nthe second place, by what brings credit to a friend than by what\r\ninvolves his condemnation.[722] And, above all, I was delighted that the\r\nsupport of the loyalists was given to me so decisively against the\r\ninfluence exerted to an incredible degree by a most illustrious and\r\npowerful personage. Finally--though, perhaps, you won't think it\r\nlikely--I hated this man much more than the notorious Clodius himself.\r\nFor the latter I had attacked, the former I had defended. The latter,\r\ntoo, though the very existence of the Republic was to be risked in my\r\nperson, had yet a certain great object in view; nor was it wholly on his\r\nown initiative, but with the support of those who could not be safe as\r\nlong as I was so. But this ape of a fellow, in sheer wantonness, had\r\nselected me as an object for his invectives, and had persuaded certain\r\npersons[723] who were jealous of me that he would always be a ready\r\ninstrument for an attack upon me. Wherefore I bid you rejoice with all\r\nyour heart: a great stroke has been struck. Never were any citizens more\r\ncourageous than those who ventured to vote for his condemnation, in the\r\nteeth of the immense power of the man by whom the jurors had themselves\r\nbeen selected. And this they never would have done had not my grievance\r\nbeen theirs also. Here, in Rome, I am so distracted by the number of\r\ntrials, the crowded courts, and the new legislation,[724] that I daily\r\noffer prayers that there may be no intercalation,[725] so that I may see\r\nyou as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 721: The condemnation of T. Munatius Plancus Bursa, who, being\r\ntribune in B.C. 52, had promoted the riots following the death of\r\nClodius, especially in regard to burning his body in the Curia, and had,\r\nafter his office terminated (10th December), been prosecuted _de vi_ by\r\nCicero successfully. Bursa, with others, had supported Pompey's wish for\r\nthe dictatorship, as well as his legislation, and accordingly, in\r\nattacking him, Cicero had against him the weight of Pompey's influence.\r\nHe therefore looks upon it as a great triumph.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 722: The condemnation of Bursa was a point in favour of Milo,\r\nwhereas Milo's murder of Clodius only brought his ultimate condemnation\r\nand exile. Milo's trial had taken place in April.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 723: Pompey and his friends.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 724: The new laws introduced by Pompey _de vi_, _de\r\nmagistratibus_, _de pecunia ob iudicium_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 725: The intercalary month was inserted between the 23rd and\r\n24th of February. Whether it was to be inserted or not depended on the\r\npontifices, who kept their secret jealously. If it is inserted, Cicero\r\nwill be kept all the longer in town with senatorial and legal business,\r\nand so be prevented from seeing Marius, who lived near his Pompeian\r\nvilla.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nDE PETITIONE CONSULATUS\r\n\r\n\r\n[This is rather an essay than a letter, and is not generally included in\r\nany of the books of the correspondence. To my mind there are indications\r\nof its being a later composition, the exercise of some one who wished to\r\nshew the nature of canvassing at the time. Still, there are many\r\narguments in favour of regarding it as the composition of Quintus, and\r\nat any rate it is a contribution to the picture of the times.]\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. CICERO TO HIS BROTHER MARCUS (AT ROME)\r\n\r\nI. Although you have all the accomplishments within the reach of human\r\ngenius, experience, or acuteness, yet I thought it only consistent with\r\nmy affection to set down in writing what occurred to my mind while\r\nthinking, as I do, day and night on your canvass, not with the\r\nexpectation that you would learn anything new from it, but that the\r\nconsiderations on a subject, which appeared to be disconnected and\r\nwithout system, might be brought under one view by a logical\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nConsider what the state is: what it is you seek: who you are that seek\r\nit. Almost every day as you go down to the forum you should say to\r\nyourself, \"I am a _novus homo_,\" \"I am a candidate for the consulship,\"\r\n\"This is Rome.\" For the \"newness\" of your name you will best compensate\r\nby the brilliancy of your oratory. That has ever carried with it very\r\ngreat political distinction. A man who is held worthy of defending\r\nconsulars cannot be thought unworthy of the consulship. Wherefore, since\r\nyour reputation in this is your starting-point, since whatever you are,\r\nyou are from this, approach each individual case with the persuasion\r\nthat on it depends as a whole your entire reputation. See that those\r\naids to natural ability, which I know are your special gifts, are ready\r\nfor use and always available; and remember what Demetrius wrote about\r\nthe hard work and practice of Demosthenes; and, finally, take care that\r\nboth the number and rank of your friends are unmistakable. For you have\r\nsuch as few _novi homines_ have had--all the _publicani_, nearly the\r\nwhole equestrian order, many municipal towns specially devoted to you,\r\nmany persons who have been defended by you, men of every order, many\r\n_collegia_, and, besides these, a large number of the rising generation\r\nwho have become attached to you in their enthusiasm for rhetoric, and,\r\nfinally, your friends who visit you daily in large numbers and with such\r\nconstant regularity. See that you retain these advantages by reminding\r\nthese persons, by appealing to them, and by using every means to make\r\nthem understand that this, and this only, is the time for those who are\r\nin your debt to show their gratitude, and for those who wish for your\r\nservices in the future to place you under an obligation. It also seems\r\npossible that a \"new man\" may be much assisted by the fact that he has\r\nthe good wishes of men of high rank, and especially of consulars. It is\r\na point in your favour that you should be thought worthy of this\r\nposition and rank by the very men to whose position and rank you are\r\nwishing to attain. All these men must be canvassed with care, agents\r\nmust be sent to them, and they must be convinced that we have always\r\nbeen at one with the Optimates in our political sentiments, that we have\r\nnever been demagogues in the very least: that if we seem ever to have\r\nsaid anything in the spirit of that party, we did so with the view of\r\nattracting Cn. Pompeius, that we might have the man of the greatest\r\ninfluence either actively on our side in our canvass, or at least not\r\nopposed to us.[726] Farthermore, take pains to get on your side the\r\nyoung men of high rank, or retain the affection of those you already\r\nhave. They will contribute much to your political position. You have\r\nvery many; make them feel how much you think depends on them: if you\r\ninduce those to be positively eager who are merely not disinclined, they\r\nwill be of very great advantage to you.\r\n\r\nII. It is also a great set-off to your \"newness,\" that the nobles who\r\nare your competitors are of a such a kind that no one can venture to say\r\nthat their nobility ought to stand them in greater stead than your high\r\ncharacter. For instance, who could think of P. Galba and L. Cassius,\r\nthough by birth of the highest rank, as candidates for the consulship?\r\nYou see, therefore, that there are men of the noblest families, who from\r\ndefect of ability are not your equals. But, you will say, Catiline and\r\nAntonius are formidable. Rather I should say that a man of energy,\r\nindustry, unimpeachable character, great eloquence, and high popularity\r\nwith those who are the ultimate judges, should wish for such\r\nrivals--both from their boyhood stained with blood and lust, both of\r\nruined fortunes. Of one of them we have seen the property put up for\r\nsale, and actually heard him declare on oath that at Rome he could not\r\ncontend with a Greek or obtain an impartial tribunal.[727] We know that\r\nhe was ejected from the senate by the judgment of genuine censors: in\r\nour prætorship we had him as a competitor, with such men as Sabidius and\r\nPanthera to back him, because he had no one else to appear for him at\r\nthe scrutiny. Yet in this office he bought a mistress from the slave\r\nmarket whom he kept openly at his house. Moreover, in his canvass for\r\nthe consulship, he has preferred to be robbing all the innkeepers, under\r\nthe disgraceful pretext of a _libera legatio_, rather than to be in town\r\nand supplicate the Roman people. But the other! Good heavens! what is\r\nhis distinction? Is he of equally noble birth? No. Is he richer? No. In\r\nmanliness, then? How do you make that out? Why, because while the former\r\nfears his own shadow, this man does not even fear the laws!--A man born\r\nin the house of a bankrupt father, nurtured in the society of an\r\nabandoned sister, grown to manhood amidst the massacre of fellow\r\ncitizens, whose first entrance to public life was made by the slaughter\r\nof Roman knights! For Sulla had specially selected Catiline to command\r\nthat band of Gauls which we remember, who shore off the heads of the\r\nTitinii and Nannii and Tanusii: and while with them he killed with his\r\nown hands the best man of the day, his own sister's husband, Quintus\r\nCæcilius, who was a Roman eques, a man belonging to no party, always\r\nquiet by inclination, and then so from age also.\r\n\r\nIII. Why should I speak of him as a candidate for the consulship, who\r\ncaused M. Marius, a man most beloved by the Roman people, to be beaten\r\nwith vine-rods in the sight of that Roman people from one end of the\r\ncity to the other--forced him up to the tomb--rent his frame with every\r\nkind of torture, and while he was still alive and breathing, cut off his\r\nhead with his sword in his right hand, while he held the hairs on the\r\ncrown of his head with his left, and carried off his head in his own\r\nhand with streams of blood flowing through his fingers?[728] A man who\r\nafterwards lived with actors and gladiators on such terms that the\r\nformer ministered to his lust, the latter to his crimes--who never\r\napproached a place so sacred or holy as not to leave there, even if no\r\nactual crime were committed, some suspicion of dishonour founded on his\r\nabandoned character--a man whose closest friends in the senate were the\r\nCurii and the Annii, in the auction rooms the Sapalæ and Carrilii, in\r\nthe equestrian order the Pompilii and Vettii--a man of such consummate\r\nimpudence, such abandoned profligacy, in fine, such cunning and success\r\nin lasciviousness, that he corrupted young boys when almost in the\r\nbosoms of their parents? Why should I after this mention Africa to you,\r\nor the depositions of the witnesses? They are well known--read them\r\nagain and again yourself. Nevertheless, I think that I should not omit\r\nto mention that he left that court in the first place as needy as some\r\nof the jurors were before the trial, and in the second place the object\r\nof such hatred, that another prosecution against him is called for every\r\nday. His position is such that he is more likely to be nervous even if\r\nyou do nothing, than contemptuous if you start any proceedings.\r\n\r\nWhat much better fortune in your canvass is yours than that which not\r\nlong ago fell to the lot of another \"new man,\" Gaius Cælius![729] He had\r\ntwo men of the highest rank as competitors, but they were of such a\r\ncharacter that their rank was the least of their recommendations--genius\r\nof the highest order, supreme modesty, very numerous public services,\r\nmost excellent methods of conducting a canvass, and diligence in\r\ncarrying them out. And yet Cælius, though much inferior in birth, and\r\nsuperior in hardly anything, beat one of them. Wherefore, if you do what\r\nyour natural ability and studies, which you have always pursued, enable\r\nyou to do, what the exigencies of your present position require, what\r\nyou are capable of doing and are bound to do, you will not have a\r\ndifficult struggle with competitors who are by no means so conspicuous\r\nfor their birth as notorious for their vices. For what citizen can there\r\nbe found so ill-affected as to wish by one vote to draw two daggers\r\nagainst the Republic?\r\n\r\nIV. Having thus set forth what advantages you have and might have to set\r\nagainst your \"newness,\" I think I ought now to say a word on the\r\nimportance of what you are trying for. You are seeking the consulship,\r\nan office of which no one thinks you unworthy, but of which there are\r\nmany who will be jealous. For, while by birth of equestrian rank,[730]\r\nyou are seeking the highest rank in the state, and yet one which, though\r\nthe highest, reflects much greater splendour on a man of courage,\r\neloquence, and pure life than on others. Don't suppose that those who\r\nhave already held that office are blind to the political position you\r\nwill occupy, when once you have obtained the same. I suspect, however,\r\nthat those who, though born of consular families, have not attained the\r\nposition of their ancestors, will, unless they happen to be strongly\r\nattached to you, feel some jealousy. Even \"new men\" who have been\r\nprætors I think, unless under great obligations to you, will not like to\r\nbe surpassed by you in official rank. Lastly, in the populace itself, I\r\nam sure it will occur to you how many are envious, how many, from the\r\nprecedents of recent years, are averse to \"new men.\" It must also needs\r\nbe that some are angry with you in consequence of the causes which you\r\nhave pleaded. Nay, carefully consider this also, whether, seeing that\r\nyou have devoted yourself with such fervour to the promotion of Pompey's\r\nglory, you can suppose certain men to be your friends on that\r\naccount.[731] Wherefore, seeing that you are seeking the highest place\r\nin the state, and at the same time that there do exist sentiments\r\nopposed to you, you must positively employ every method, and all your\r\nvigilance, labour, and attention to business.\r\n\r\nV. Again, the canvass for office resolves itself into an activity of two\r\nkinds, of which one is concerned with the loyalty of friends, the other\r\nwith the feelings of the people. The loyalty of friends must be secured\r\nby acts of kindness and attention, by length of time, and by an easy and\r\nagreeable temper. But this word \"friends\" has a wider application during\r\na canvass than in other times of our life. For whosoever gives any sign\r\nof an inclination to you, or habitually visits at your house, must be\r\nput down in the category of friends. But yet the most advantageous thing\r\nis to be beloved and pleasant in the eyes of those who are friends on\r\nthe more regular grounds of relationship by blood or marriage, of\r\nmembership of the same club, or of some close tie or other. Farther, you\r\nmust take great pains that, in proportion as a man is most intimate and\r\nmost closely connected with your household, he should love you and\r\ndesire your highest honour--as, for instance, your tribesmen,\r\nneighbours, clients, and finally your freedmen and even your slaves; for\r\nnearly all the talk which forms one's public reputation emanates from\r\ndomestic sources. In a word, you must secure friends of every class: for\r\nshow--men conspicuous for their office or name, who, even if they do not\r\ngive any actual assistance in canvassing, yet add some dignity to the\r\ncandidate; to maintain your just rights--magistrates, consuls first and\r\nthen tribunes; to secure the votes of the centuries--men of eminent\r\npopularity. Those who either have gained or hope to gain the vote of a\r\ntribe or century, or any other advantage, through your influence, take\r\nall pains to collect and secure. For during recent years men of ambition\r\nhave exerted themselves with all their might and main to become sure of\r\ngetting from their tribesmen what they sought. Do you also do your very\r\nbest, by every means in your power, to make such men attached to you\r\nfrom the bottom of their hearts and with the most complete devotion. If,\r\nindeed, men were as grateful as they ought to be, all this should be\r\nready to your hand, as I trust in fact that it is. For within the last\r\ntwo years you have put under an obligation to you four clubs of men who\r\nhave the very greatest influence in promoting an election, those of C.\r\nFundanius, Q. Gallius, C. Cornelius, C. Orchivius.[732] When they\r\ncommitted the defence of these men to you, I am acquainted with what\r\ntheir clubsmen undertook and promised you to do, for I was present at\r\nthe interview. Wherefore you must insist at the present juncture on\r\nexacting from them your due by reminding them, appealing to them,\r\nsolemnly assuring them, and taking care that they thoroughly understand\r\nthat they will never have any other opportunity of shewing their\r\ngratitude. I cannot doubt that these men, from hope of your services in\r\nthe future as well as from the benefits recently received, will be\r\nroused to active exertions. And speaking generally, since your\r\ncandidature is most strongly supported by that class of friendships\r\nwhich you have gained as a counsel for the defence, take care that to\r\nall those, whom you have placed under this obligation to you, their duty\r\nshould in every case be clearly defined and set forth. And as you have\r\nnever been in any matter importunate with them, so be careful that they\r\nunderstand that you have reserved for this occasion all that you\r\nconsider them to owe you.\r\n\r\nVI. But since men are principally induced to shew goodwill and zeal at\r\nthe hustings by three considerations--kindness received, hope of more,\r\npersonal affection and good feeling--we must take notice how best to\r\ntake advantage of each of these. By very small favours men are induced\r\nto think that they have sufficient reason for giving support at the\r\npoll, and surely those you have saved (and their number is very large)\r\ncannot fail to understand that, if at this supreme crisis they fail to\r\ndo what you wish, they will never have anyone's confidence. And though\r\nthis is so, nevertheless they must be appealed to, and must even be led\r\nto think it possible that they, who have hitherto been under an\r\nobligation to us, may now put us under an obligation to them. Those,\r\nagain, who are influenced by hope (a class of people much more apt to be\r\nscrupulously attentive) you must take care to convince that your\r\nassistance is at their service at any moment, and to make them\r\nunderstand that you are carefully watching the manner in which they\r\nperform the duties they owe you, and to allow no mistake to exist as to\r\nyour clearly perceiving and taking note of the amount of support coming\r\nfrom each one of them. The third class which I mentioned is that of\r\nspontaneous and sincere friends, and this class you will have to make\r\nmore secure by expressions of your gratitude; by making your words tally\r\nwith the motives which it shall appear to you influenced them in taking\r\nup your cause; by shewing that the affection is mutual; and by\r\nsuggesting that your friendship with them may ripen into intimacy and\r\nfamiliar intercourse. In all these classes alike consider and weigh\r\ncarefully the amount of influence each possesses, in order to know both\r\nthe kind of attention to pay to each, and what you are to expect and\r\ndemand from each. For certain men are popular in their own\r\nneighbourhoods and towns; there are others possessed of energy and\r\nwealth, who, even if they have not heretofore sought such popularity,\r\ncan yet easily obtain it at the moment for the sake of one to whom they\r\nowe or wish to do a favour. Your attention to such classes of men must\r\nbe such as to shew them that you clearly understand what is to be\r\nexpected from each, that you appreciate what you are receiving, and\r\nremember what you have received. There are, again, others who either\r\nhave no influence or are positively disliked by their tribesmen, and\r\nhave neither the spirit nor the ability to exert themselves on the spur\r\nof the moment: be sure you distinguish between such men, that you may\r\nnot be disappointed in your expectation of support by placing over-much\r\nhope on some particular person.\r\n\r\nVII. But although you ought to rely on, and be fortified by, friendships\r\nalready gained and firmly secured, yet in the course of the canvass\r\nitself very numerous and useful friendships are acquired. For among its\r\nannoyances a candidature has this advantage: you can without loss of\r\ndignity, as you cannot in other affairs of life, admit whomsoever you\r\nchoose to your friendship, to whom if you were at any other time to\r\noffer your society, you would be thought guilty of an eccentricity;\r\nwhereas during a canvass, if you don't do so with many, and take pains\r\nabout it besides, you would be thought to be no use as a candidate at\r\nall. Moreover, I can assure you of this, that there is no one, unless he\r\nhappens to be bound by some special tie to some one of your rivals,\r\nwhom you could not induce, if you took pains, to earn your affection by\r\nhis good services, and to seize the opportunity of putting you under an\r\nobligation--let him but fully understand that you value him highly, that\r\nyou really mean what you say, that he is making a good investment, and\r\nthat there will accrue from it not only a brief and electioneering\r\nfriendship, but a firm and lasting one. There will be no one, believe\r\nme, if he has anything in him at all, who will let slip this opportunity\r\noffered of establishing a friendship with you, especially when by good\r\nluck you have competitors whose friendship is one to be neglected or\r\navoided, and who not only are unable to secure what I am urging you to\r\nsecure, but cannot even make the first step towards it. For how should\r\nAntonius make the first step towards attaching people to himself, when\r\nhe cannot even call them, unaided, by their proper names? I, for one,\r\nthink that there can be no greater folly than to imagine a man\r\nsolicitous to serve you whom you don't know by sight. Extraordinary\r\nindeed must be the fame, the political position and extent of the public\r\nservices of that man whom entire strangers, without supporters to back\r\nhim, would elect to office. That a man without principle or energy,\r\nwithout doing any good service, and without ability, lying under a cloud\r\nof discredit, and without friends, should beat a man fortified with the\r\ndevotion of a numerous circle and by the good opinion of all, cannot\r\npossibly occur except from gross negligence.\r\n\r\nVIII. Wherefore see that you have the votes of all the centuries secured\r\nto you by the number and variety of your friends. The first and most\r\nobvious thing is that you should embrace the Roman senators and knights,\r\nand the active and popular men of all the other orders. There are many\r\ncity men of good business habits, there are many freedmen engaged in the\r\nforum who are popular and energetic: these men try with all your might\r\nboth personally and by common friends, as far as you can, to make eager\r\nin your behalf; seek them out, send agents to them, shew them that they\r\nare putting you under the greatest obligation. After that review the\r\nentire city, all colleges, districts, neighbourhoods. If you attach to\r\nyourself the leading men of these, you will by their means easily keep a\r\nhold upon the multitude. When you have done that, take care to have in\r\nyour mind a chart of all Italy laid out according to the tribe of each\r\ntown, and learn it by heart, so that you may not allow any _municipium_,\r\ncolony, prefecture, or, in a word, any spot in Italy to exist, in which\r\nyou have not a sufficient foothold. Inquire also for and trace out\r\nindividuals in every region, inform yourself about them, seek them out,\r\nstrengthen their resolution, secure that in their own neighbourhoods\r\nthey shall canvass for you, and be as it were candidates in your\r\ninterest. They will wish for you as a friend, if they once see that\r\ntheir friendship is an object with you. Make sure that they _do_\r\nunderstand this by directing your speech specially to this point. Men of\r\ncountry towns, or from the country, think themselves in the position of\r\nfriends if we of the city know them by name: if, however, they think\r\nthat they are besides securing some protection for themselves, they do\r\nnot let slip the opportunity of being obliging. Of such people others in\r\ntown, and above all your rivals, don't so much as know the existence:\r\nyou know about them and will easily recognize them, without which\r\nfriendship is impossible. Nor is such recognition enough (though it is a\r\ngreat thing) unless some hope of material advantage and active\r\nfriendship follows, for your object is not to be looked upon as a mere\r\n\"nomenclator,\" but as a sincere friend also. So when you have both got\r\nthe favour of these same men in the centuries, who from the means they\r\nhave taken to secure their personal objects enjoy most popularity among\r\ntheir fellow tribesmen; and have made those all desirous of your success\r\nwho have influence in any section of their tribe, owing to\r\nconsiderations attaching to their municipality or neighbourhood or\r\ncollege, then you may allow yourself to entertain the highest hopes.\r\n\r\nAgain, the centuries of the knights appear to me capable of being won\r\nover, if you are careful, with considerably more ease. Let your first\r\ncare be to acquaint yourself with the knights; for they are\r\ncomparatively few: then make advances to them, for it is much easier to\r\ngain the friendship of young men at their time of life. Then again, you\r\nhave on your side the best of the rising generation, and the most\r\ndevoted to learning. Moreover, as the equestrian order is yours, they\r\nwill follow the example of that order, if only you take the trouble to\r\nconfirm the support of those centuries, not only by the general good\r\naffection of the order, but also by the friendships of individuals.\r\nFinally, the hearty zeal of the young in canvassing for votes, appearing\r\nat various places, bringing intelligence, and being in attendance on you\r\nin public are surprisingly important as well as creditable.\r\n\r\nIX. And since I have mentioned \"attendance,\" I may add that you should\r\nbe careful to see large companies every day of every class and order;\r\nfor from the mere number of these a guess may well be made as to the\r\namount of support you are likely to have in the _campus_ itself. Such\r\nvisitors are of three kinds: one consists of morning callers who come to\r\nyour house, a second of those who escort you to the forum, a third of\r\nthose who attend you on your canvass. In the case of the morning\r\ncallers, who are less select and, according to the prevailing fashion,\r\ncome in greater numbers, you must contrive to make them think that you\r\nvalue even this slight attention very highly. Let those who shall come\r\nto your house see that you notice it; shew your gratification to such\r\nof their friends as will repeat it to them; frequently mention it to the\r\npersons themselves. It often happens that people, when they visit a\r\nnumber of candidates, and observe that there is one who above the rest\r\nnotices these attentions, devote themselves to him; leave off visiting\r\nthe others; little by little become devoted to one instead of being\r\nneutral, and from sham turn out real supporters. Farthermore, carefully\r\nremember this, if you have been told or have discovered that a man who\r\nhas given you his promise is \"dressing for the occasion,\" as the phrase\r\ngoes, make as though you had neither heard it nor knew it; if any offers\r\nto clear himself to you, because he thinks himself suspected, assert\r\nroundly that you have never doubted his sincerity and have no right to\r\ndoubt it. For the man who thinks that he is not giving satisfaction can\r\nnever be a friend. You ought, however, to know each man's real feeling,\r\nin order to settle how much confidence to place in him.\r\n\r\nSecondly, of those who escort you to the forum: since this is a greater\r\nattention than a morning call, indicate and make clear that it is still\r\nmore gratifying to you, and as far as it shall lie in your power go down\r\nto the forum at fixed times. The daily escort by its numbers produces a\r\ngreat impression and confers great personal distinction. The third class\r\nis that of numbers perpetually attending you on your canvass. See that\r\nthose who do so spontaneously understand that you regard yourself as for\r\never obliged by their extreme kindness: from those, on the other hand,\r\nwho owe you this attention, frankly demand that, as far as their age and\r\nbusiness allow, they should constantly be in personal attendance, and\r\nthat those who are unable to accompany you in person should find\r\nrelations to take their place in performing this duty. I am very\r\nanxious, and think it extremely important, that you should always be\r\nsurrounded by large numbers. Besides, it confers a great reputation and\r\ngreat distinction to be accompanied by those who by your exertions have\r\nbeen defended, preserved, and acquitted in the law courts. Put this\r\ndemand fairly before them, that, since by your means and without any\r\npayment some have retained their property, others their honour, others\r\ntheir civil existence and entire fortunes, and since there will never be\r\nany other time at which they can show their gratitude, they should\r\nremunerate you by this service.\r\n\r\nX. And since the point now in discussion is entirely a question of the\r\nloyalty of friends, I must not, I think, pass over one caution.\r\nDeception, intrigue, and treachery are everywhere. This is not the time\r\nfor a formal disquisition on the indications by which a true friend may\r\nbe distinguished from a false: all that is in place now is to give you a\r\nhint. Your exalted character has compelled many to pretend to be your\r\nfriends while really jealous of you. Wherefore remember the saying of\r\nEpicharmus, \"the muscle and bone of wisdom is to believe nothing\r\nrashly.\" Again, when you have got the feelings of your friends in a\r\nsound state, you must then acquaint yourself with the attitude and\r\nvarieties of your detractors and opponents. There are three: first,\r\nthose whom you have attacked; second, those who dislike you without\r\ndefinite reason; third, those who are warm friends of your competitors.\r\nAs to those attacked by you while pleading a friend's cause against\r\nthem, frankly excuse yourself; remind them of the ties constraining you;\r\ngive them reason to hope that you will act with equal zeal and loyalty\r\nin their cases, if they become your friends. As for those who dislike\r\nyou without reason, do your best to remove that prejudice either by some\r\nactual service, or by holding out hopes of it, or by indicating your\r\nkindly feeling towards them. As for those whose wishes are against you\r\nowing to friendship for your competitors, gratify them also by the same\r\nmeans as the former, and, if you can get them to believe it, shew that\r\nyou are kindly disposed to the very men who are standing against you.\r\n\r\nXI. Having said enough about securing friendships, I must now speak on\r\nanother department of a candidate's task, which is concerned with the\r\nconciliation of the people. This demands a knack of remembering names,\r\ninsinuating manners, constant attendance, liberality, the power of\r\nsetting a report afloat and creating a hopeful feeling in the state.\r\nFirst of all, make the faculty you possess of recognizing people\r\nconspicuous, and go on increasing and improving it every day. I don't\r\nthink there is anything so popular or so conciliatory. Next, if nature\r\nhas denied you some quality, resolve to assume it, so as to appear to be\r\nacting naturally. Although nature has great force, yet in a business\r\nlasting only a few months it seems probable that the artificial may be\r\nthe more effective. For though you are not lacking in the courtesy which\r\ngood and polite men should have, yet there is great need of a flattering\r\nmanner which, however faulty and discreditable in other transactions of\r\nlife, is yet necessary during a candidateship. For when it makes a man\r\nworse by truckling, it is wrong; but when only more friendly, it does\r\nnot deserve so harsh a term; while it is absolutely necessary to a\r\ncandidate, whose face and expression and style of conversation have to\r\nbe varied and accommodated to the feelings and tastes of everyone he\r\nmeets. As for \"constant attendance,\" there is no need of laying down any\r\nrule, the phrase speaks for itself. It is, of course, of very great\r\nconsequence not to go away anywhere; but the real advantage of such\r\nconstant attendance is not only the being at Rome and in the forum, but\r\nthe pushing one's canvass assiduously, the addressing oneself again and\r\nagain to the same persons, the making it impossible (as far as your\r\npower goes) for anyone to say that he has not been asked by you, and\r\nearnestly and carefully asked. Liberality is, again, of wide\r\napplication; it is shewn in regard to the management of your private\r\nproperty, which, even if it does not actually reach the multitude, yet,\r\nif spoken of with praise by friends, earns the favour of the multitude.\r\nIt may also be displayed in banquets, which you must take care to attend\r\nyourself and to cause your friends to attend, whether open ones or those\r\nconfined to particular tribes. It may, again, be displayed in giving\r\npractical assistance, which I would have you render available far and\r\nwide: and be careful therein to be accessible to all by day and night,\r\nand not only by the doors of your house, but by your face and\r\ncountenance, which is the door of the mind; for, if that shews your\r\nfeelings to be those of reserve and concealment, it is of little good to\r\nhave your house doors open. For men desire not only to have promises\r\nmade them, especially in their applications to a candidate, but to have\r\nthem made in a liberal and complimentary manner. Accordingly, it is an\r\neasy rule to make, that you should indicate that whatever you are going\r\nto do you will do with heartiness and pleasure; it is somewhat more\r\ndifficult, and rather a concession to the necessities of the moment than\r\nto your inclination, that when you cannot do a thing you should [either\r\npromise] or put your refusal pleasantly: the latter is the conduct of a\r\ngood man, the former of a good candidate. For when a request is made\r\nwhich we cannot grant with honour or without loss to ourselves, for\r\ninstance, if a man were to ask us to appear in a suit against a friend,\r\na refusal must be given in a gentlemanly way: you must point out to him\r\nthat your hands are tied, must shew that you are exceedingly sorry, must\r\nconvince him that you will make up for it in other ways.\r\n\r\nXII. I have heard a man say about certain orators, to whom he had\r\noffered his case, \"that he had been better pleased with the words of the\r\none who declined, than of the one who accepted.\" So true it is that men\r\nare more taken by look and words than by actual services. [This latter\r\ncourse, however, you will readily approve: the former it is somewhat\r\ndifficult to recommend to a Platonist like you, but yet I will have\r\nregard for your present circumstances.] For even those to whom you are\r\nforced by any other tie to refuse your advocacy may yet quit you\r\nmollified and with friendly feelings. But those to whom you only excuse\r\na refusal by saying that you are hindered by the affairs of closer\r\nfriends, or by cases more important or previously undertaken, quit you\r\nwith hostile feelings, and are one and all disposed to prefer an\r\ninsincere promise to a direct negative from you. C. Cotta, a master in\r\nthe art of electioneering, used to say that, \"so long as the request was\r\nnot directly contrary to moral duty, he used to promise his assistance\r\nto all, to bestow it on those with whom he thought it would be most\r\nadvantageously invested: he did not refuse anyone, because something\r\noften turned up to prevent the person whom he promised from availing\r\nhimself of it, and it often also occurred that he himself was less\r\nengaged than he had thought at the time; nor could anyone's house be\r\nfull of suitors who only undertook what he saw his way to perform: by\r\nsome accident or other the unexpected often happens, while business,\r\nwhich you have believed to be actually in hand, from some cause or other\r\ndoes not come off: moreover, the worst that can happen is that the man\r\nto whom you have made a false promise is angry.\" This last risk,\r\nsupposing you to make the promise, is uncertain, is prospective, and\r\nonly affects a few; but, if you refuse, the offence given is certain,\r\nimmediate, and more widely diffused. For many more ask to be allowed to\r\navail themselves of the help of another than actually do so. Wherefore\r\nit is better that some of them should at times be angry with you in the\r\nforum, than all of them perpetually at your own house: especially as\r\nthey are more inclined to be angry with those who refuse, than with a\r\nman whom they perceive to be prevented by so grave a cause as to be\r\ncompatible with the desire to fulfil his promise if he possibly could.\r\nBut that I may not appear to have abandoned my own classification, since\r\nthe department of a candidate's work on which I am now dilating is that\r\nwhich refers to the populace, I insist on this, that all these\r\nobservations have reference not so much to the feelings of friends as to\r\npopular rumour. Though there is something in what I say which comes\r\nunder the former head--such as answering with kindness, and giving\r\nzealous assistance in the business and the dangers of friends--yet in\r\nthis part of my argument I am speaking of the things which enable you to\r\nwin over the populace: for instance, the having your house full of\r\nvisitors before daybreak, the securing the affection of many by giving\r\nthem hope of your support, the contriving that men should leave you with\r\nmore friendly feelings than they came, the filling the ears of as many\r\nas possible with the most telling words.\r\n\r\nXIII. For my next theme must be popular report, to which very great\r\nattention must be paid. But what I have said throughout the foregoing\r\ndiscourse applies also to the diffusion of a favourable report: the\r\nreputation for eloquence; the favour of the _publicani_ and equestrian\r\norder; the goodwill of men of rank; the crowd of young men; the constant\r\nattendance of those whom you have defended; the number of those from\r\nmunicipal towns who have notoriously come to Rome on your account; the\r\nobservations which men make in your favour--that you recognize them,\r\naddress them politely, are assiduous and earnest in canvassing; that\r\nthey speak and think of you as kind and liberal; the having your house\r\nfull of callers long before daybreak; the presence of large numbers of\r\nevery class; that your look and speech give satisfaction to all, your\r\nacts and deeds to many; that everything is done which can be done by\r\nhard work, skill, and attention, not to cause the fame arising from all\r\nthese displays of feeling to reach the people, but to bring the people\r\nitself to share them. You have already won the city populace and the\r\naffections of those who control the public meetings by your panegyric of\r\nPompey, by undertaking the cause of Manilius, by your defence of\r\nCornelius.[733] We must not let those advantages be forgotten, which\r\nhitherto no one has had without possessing at the same time the favour\r\nof the great. We must also take care that everyone knows that Cn.\r\nPompeius is strongly in your favour, and that it emphatically suits his\r\npurpose that you should win your election. Lastly, take care that your\r\nwhole candidature is full of _éclat_, brilliant, splendid, suited to the\r\npopular taste, presenting a spectacle of the utmost dignity and\r\nmagnificence. See also, if possible, that some new scandal is started\r\nagainst your competitors for crime or looseness of life or corruption,\r\nsuch as is in harmony with their characters.\r\n\r\nAbove all in this election you must see that the Republic entertains a\r\ngood hope and an honourable opinion of you. And yet you must not enter\r\nupon political measures in senate-house and public meeting while a\r\ncandidate: you must hold such things in abeyance, in order that from\r\nyour lifelong conduct the senate may judge you likely to be the\r\nsupporter of their authority; the Roman knights, along with the\r\nloyalists and wealthy, judge you from your past to be eager for peace\r\nand quiet times; and the people think of you as not likely to be hostile\r\nto their interests from the fact that in your style of speaking in\r\npublic meetings, and in your declared convictions, you have been on the\r\npopular side.\r\n\r\nXIV. This is what occurred to me to say on the subject of these two\r\nmorning reflexions, which I said you ought to turn over in your mind\r\nevery day as you went down to the forum: \"I am a _novus homo_,\" \"I am a\r\ncandidate for the consulship.\" There remains the third, \"This is Rome,\"\r\na city made up of a combination of nations, in which many snares, much\r\ndeception, many vices enter into every department of life: in which you\r\nhave to put up with the arrogant pretensions, the wrong-headedness, the\r\nill-will, the hauteur, the disagreeable temper and offensive manners of\r\nmany. I well understand that it requires great prudence and skill for a\r\nman, living among social vices of every sort, so many and so serious, to\r\navoid giving offence, causing scandal, or falling into traps, and in his\r\nsingle person to adapt himself to such a vast variety of character,\r\nspeech, and feeling. Wherefore, I say again and again, go on\r\npersistently in the path you have begun: put yourself above rivalry in\r\neloquence; it is by this that people at Rome are charmed and attracted,\r\nas well as deterred from obstructing a man's career or inflicting an\r\ninjury upon him. And since the chief plague spot of our state is that it\r\nallows the prospect of a bribe to blind it to virtue and worth, be sure\r\nthat you are fully aware of your own strength, that is, understand that\r\nyou are the man capable of producing in the minds of your rivals the\r\nstrongest fear of legal proceeding and legal peril. Let them know that\r\nthey are watched and scrutinized by you: they will be in terror of your\r\nenergy, as well as of your influence and power of speech, and above all\r\nof the affection of the equestrian order towards you. But though I wish\r\nyou to hold out this before them, I do not wish you to make it appear\r\nthat you are already meditating an action, but to use this terror so as\r\nto facilitate the gaining of your object: and, in a word, in this\r\ncontest strain every nerve and use every faculty in such a way as to\r\nsecure what we seek. I notice that there are no elections so deeply\r\ntainted with corruption, but that some centuries return men closely\r\nconnected with them without receiving money. Therefore, if we are as\r\nvigilant as the greatness of our object demands, and rouse our\r\nwell-wishers to put forth all their energies; and if we allot to men of\r\ninfluence and zeal in our service their several tasks; if we put before\r\nour rivals the threat of legal proceedings; if we inspire their agents\r\nwith fear, and by some means check the distributors, it is possible to\r\nsecure either that there shall be no bribery or that it shall be\r\nineffectual.\r\n\r\nThese are the points that I thought, not that I knew better than you,\r\nbut that I could more easily than you--in the pressing state of your\r\npresent engagements--collect together and send you written out. And\r\nalthough they are written in such terms as not to apply to all\r\ncandidates for office, but to your special case and to your particular\r\nelection, yet I should be glad if you would tell me of anything that\r\nshould be corrected or entirely struck out, or that has been omitted.\r\nFor I wish this little essay \"on the duties of a candidate\" to be\r\nregarded as complete in every respect.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 726: It is to be observed that at this time Pompey is reckoned\r\nas inclined to the _populares_. His legislation in B.C. 70 had been\r\nsomewhat in their favour; but he had not, as a fact, ever declared\r\nhimself either way.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 727: C.

B.C. 57, was\r\naccused of _maiestas_ in B.C. 55, and defended by Cicero. He had become\r\nalienated from the senate by its opposition to his legislation against\r\nusury in the provinces, and the case made a great sensation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\nL. VETTIUS (LETTER L, A II, 24)\r\n\r\n\r\nL. Vettius, a kind of Titus Oates, was like the witness in \"Great\r\nExpectations,\" prepared to swear \"mostly anything.\" The interest\r\nattaching to such a sordid person is confined to the question whether he\r\nwas really acting with the connivance of, or under an agreement with,\r\nany of the leading politicians of the day. If the principle of _cui\r\nbono_ is applied, it is evident that the gainers were the party of the\r\ntrumvirs, whose popularity would be increased by a belief being created\r\nthat their opponents the Optimates were prepared to adopt extreme\r\nmeasures to get rid of them. It would give them just the advantage which\r\nthe Rye House plot gave Charles II. This is Cicero's view, it seems, of\r\nthe matter, as insinuated in this letter and in his speech against\r\nVatinius (§§ 24-26; cp. _pro Sest._ § 132). In the letter, however, his\r\ninsinuations seem directed against Cæsar: in the speech Vatinius is the\r\nscape-goat. But Vettius was not only a liar, but a bad liar. He made\r\nblunders; and when he brought in the name of Bibulus, he was not aware\r\nthat Bibulus had got scent of something going on, and had secured\r\nhimself by giving Pompey warning. He also did not tell consistent\r\nstories, mentioning names (such as that of Brutus) at one time, and\r\nwithdrawing them at another. He was accordingly wholly discredited, and\r\ncould therefore expect no protection from Cæsar, who had been careful\r\nnot to commit himself; and he had nothing for it but suicide, like\r\nPigott at the time of the Parnell Commission.\r\n\r\nCicero, then, would have us believe that Vettius had been instigated by\r\nVatinius (acting for Cæsar) to name Bibulus, L. Lucullus, Curio (father\r\nand son), L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, L. Lentulus, L. Paullus, Cicero\r\nhimself, his son-in-law Piso, and M. Laterensis, as having been all more\r\nor less privy to the plot to murder Pompey and Cæsar. That there was\r\nabsolutely no such plot, and that Vettius broke down hopelessly when\r\nquestioned. That the object was, (1) to irritate Pompey with the\r\nOptimates and so confirm him in his alliance with Cæsar, (2) to\r\ndiscredit the Optimates generally.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to state briefly the views put forward by our other\r\nauthorities for this period.\r\n\r\n(1.) Suetonius (_Cæs. 20_) appears to attribute the instigation of\r\nVettius to Cæsar, as also the murder of Vettius in prison, after he\r\nbroke down so flagrantly. The text of this passage, however, is somewhat\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n(2.) Appian (_B. C._ ii. 12) describes the scene as happening at the\r\ntime that Cæsar's agrarian law was being passed, and Bibulus was hustled\r\nin the forum. Vettius, with a drawn dagger, rushed into the crowd crying\r\nout that he had been sent by Bibulus, Cicero, and Cato to assassinate\r\nCæsar and Pompey, and that an attendant of Bibulus had given him the\r\ndagger. Vettius was arrested, put into prison to be questioned the next\r\nday, and was murdered during the night. Cæsar meanwhile addressed the\r\npeople and excited their anger; but after the death of Vettius the\r\nmatter was hushed up.\r\n\r\n(3.) Plutarch (_Lucull._ 42) says that the \"Pompeians,\" annoyed at\r\nfinding the union with Cæsar opposed by the leading Optimates, induced\r\nVettius to accuse Lucullus and others of a plot to assassinate Pompey;\r\nand that the corpse of Vettius shewed evident signs of violence.\r\n\r\n(4.) Dio Cassius (38-39) says bluntly that Vettius was employed by\r\nLucullus and Cicero to assassinate Pompey, and was got rid of in prison.\r\nHe adds that Vettius was discredited by bringing in the name of Bibulus,\r\nwho (as Cicero also says) had secured himself by giving Pompey warning.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions seem to be (though in such a tangled skein of lies it is\r\nimpossible to be sure), (1) that there was no plot, properly so called,\r\nthough many of the Optimates, and Cicero among them, had used incautious\r\nlanguage; (2) that Vettius was suborned by some person or party of\r\npersons to make the people believe that there was one; (3) that\r\nCæsar--though there is not sufficient evidence to shew that he had been\r\nthe instigator--was willing to take advantage of the prejudice created\r\nby the suspicions thus aroused; (4) that though Vettius had served\r\nCicero in his capacity of spy in the days of the Catilinarian\r\nconspiracy, and was able to report words of his sufficiently\r\ncharacteristic, yet this letter to Atticus exonerates Cicero from\r\nsuspicion, even if there were a plot, and even if we could believe that\r\nhe could have brought himself to plot the death of Pompey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C\r\n\r\n\r\n     The following letters to Tiro, with one from Quintus in regard to\r\n     his manumission, are given here because of the difficulty of dating\r\n     them. The indications of time are as follows. I. Those addressed to\r\n     Tiro are earlier than that of Quintus, because they refer to a\r\n     promised emancipation, while that of Quintus speaks of it as\r\n     accomplished. II. The letter of Quintus is after the emancipation\r\n     of his own freedman Statius, which apparently took place B.C. 59.\r\n     III. Quintus is at a distance from Italy, and is looking forward to\r\n     rejoin his brother and family. IV. Cicero is engaged on some more\r\n     than ordinary literary work. V. Pompey is visiting Cicero in his\r\n     Cuman villa. Now after his return from Asia (B.C. 58), Quintus was\r\n     only twice thus distant, in B.C. 57-56 in Sardinia, and in B.C.\r\n     54-53 in Britain and Gaul. In both of these periods Cicero was\r\n     engaged on literary work; in the former on the _de Oratore_, in the\r\n     latter on the _de Republica_. There is really no means of deciding\r\n     between these two. It is even possible that they might be placed\r\n     some time during the proprietorship of Quintus in Asia (B.C.\r\n     62-59), during which Cicero was engaged, among other things, on a\r\n     poem on his own times and a history of his consulship. Tiro--or M.\r\n     Tullius Tiro, as he was called after his emancipation--was not a\r\n     young man, and may well have been emancipated even in B.C. 59.\r\n     According to Hieronymus, he died in B.C. 5 in his hundredth year.\r\n     He was therefore little more than a year younger than Cicero\r\n     himself. The illness of Tiro must have been an earlier one than\r\n     that of which we shall hear much in B.C. 50-49.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI (F XVI, 13)\r\n\r\nTO TIRO\r\n\r\n(CUMÆ) 10 APRIL\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall consider that I have everything possible from you, if I see you\r\nin good health. I am awaiting the arrival of Andricus, whom I sent to\r\nyou, with the utmost anxiety. Do take pains to recover, if you love me:\r\nand as soon as you have thoroughly re-established your health, come to\r\nme. Good-bye.\r\n\r\n10 April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII (F XVI, 14)\r\n\r\nTO TIRO\r\n\r\n(CUMÆ) 11 APRIL\r\n\r\n\r\nAndricus arrived a day later than I expected him, and accordingly I had\r\na night of terror and unhappiness. Your letter does not make me at all\r\nmore certain of your state, and yet it did revive me. I can take\r\npleasure in nothing; can employ myself in no literary work, which I\r\ncannot touch till I have seen you. Give orders to promise the doctor any\r\nfee he chooses to ask. I wrote to that effect to Ummidius. I am told\r\nthat your mind is ill at ease, and that the doctor says this is what\r\nmakes you ill. If you care for me, rouse from their sleep your studies\r\nand your culture, which make you the dearest object of my affection. It\r\nis your mind that requires strengthening now, in order that your body\r\nmay also recover. Pray do it both for your own and my sake. Keep Acastus\r\nwith you to help to nurse you. Preserve yourself for me. The day for the\r\nfulfilment of my promise is at hand, and I will be true to it, if you\r\nonly come. Good-bye, good-bye!\r\n\r\n11 April, noon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII (F XVI, 15)\r\n\r\nTO TIRO\r\n\r\n(CUMÆ) 12 APRIL\r\n\r\n\r\nÆgypta arrived on the 12th of April. Though he brought the news that you\r\nwere entirely without fever and were pretty well, yet he caused me\r\nanxiety by saying that you had not been able to write to me: and all the\r\nmore so because Hermia, who ought to have arrived on the same day, has\r\nnot done so. I am incredibly anxious about your health. If you will\r\nrelieve me from that, I will _liberate_ you from every burden. I would\r\nhave written at greater length, if I had thought that you were now\r\ncapable of taking any pleasure in reading a letter. Concentrate your\r\nwhole intelligence, which I value above everything, upon preserving\r\nyourself for your own and my benefit. Use your utmost diligence, I\r\nrepeat, in nursing your health. Good-bye.\r\n\r\nP.S.--When I had finished the above Hermia arrived. I have your letter\r\nwritten in a shaky hand, and no wonder after so serious an illness. I am\r\nsending Ægypta back to stay with you, because he is by no means without\r\nfeeling, and seems to me to be attached to you, and with him a cook for\r\nyour especial use. Good-bye!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV (F XVI, 10)\r\n\r\nTO TIRO\r\n\r\nCUMÆ, 19 MAY\r\n\r\n\r\nI of course wish you to come to me, but I dread the journey for you. You\r\nhave been most seriously ill: you have been much reduced by a low diet\r\nand purgatives, and the ravages of the disease itself. After dangerous\r\nillnesses, if some mistake is made, drawbacks are usually dangerous.\r\nMoreover, to the two days on the road which it will have taken you to\r\nreach Cumæ, there will have to be added at once five more for your\r\nreturn journey to Rome. I mean to be at Formiæ on the 30th: be sure, my\r\ndear Tiro, that I find you there strong and well. My poor studies, or\r\nrather _ours_, have been in a very bad way owing to your absence.\r\nHowever, they have looked up a little owing to this letter from you\r\nbrought by Acastus. Pompey is staying with me at the moment of writing\r\nthis, and seems to be cheerful and enjoying himself. He asks me to read\r\nhim something of ours, but I told him that without you the oracle was\r\ndumb. Pray prepare to renew your services to our Muses. My promise shall\r\nbe _performed_ on the day named: for I have taught you the etymology of\r\n_fides_.[734] Take care to make a complete recovery. I shall be with you\r\ndirectly. Good-bye.\r\n\r\n19 May.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 734: From _fio_, according to Cicero, _credamusque quia \"fiat\"\r\nquod dictum est, appellatam fidem_ (_de Off._ i. § 23). He is referring\r\nto his promise to emancipate Tiro on a particular day.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV (F XVI, 16)\r\n\r\nQ. CICERO TO HIS BROTHER\r\n\r\n(GAUL?)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I hope to see you again, my dear Marcus, and my own son Cicero, and\r\nyour Tulliola and your son, I am delighted about Tiro. He was much too\r\ngood for his position, and I am truly glad that you preferred that he\r\nshould be our freedman and friend rather than our slave. Believe me,\r\nwhen I read your letter and his I jumped for joy, and I both thank and\r\ncongratulate you: for if the fidelity and good character of my own\r\nStatius is a delight to me, how much more valuable must those same\r\nqualities be in your man, since there is added to them knowledge of\r\nliterature, conversational powers, and culture, which have advantages\r\neven over those useful virtues! I have all sorts of most conclusive\r\nreasons for loving you: and here is another one, either for what you\r\nhave done, or, if you choose, for your perfect manner of announcing it\r\nto me. Your letter shewed me your whole heart. I have promised Sabinus's\r\nservants all they asked, and I will perform my promise.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. I.",
