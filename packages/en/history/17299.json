A fine afternoon in September.  The mountain ranges\r\nwere bathed in sunshine and the scarred and seamy face of stern old\r\nErrigal seemed almost to smile.  A gentle breeze stirred the air and the\r\nsurface of the lakes lay shimmering in the soft autumnal light.  The blue\r\nsky, flecked with white cloudlets, the purple of the heather, the dark\r\nhues of the bogs, the varied greens of bracken, ferns and grass, the gold\r\nof ripening grain, and the grey of the mountain boulders, together formed\r\na harmony of colour which charmed the eye and soothed the mind.\r\n\r\nI had been travelling most of the day by railway through this delightful\r\ncountry, not by an express that rushed you through the scenery with\r\nbreathless haste, but by an easy-going mixed train which called at every\r\nstation.  Sometimes its speed reached twenty-five miles an hour, but\r\nnever more, and because of numerous curves and gradients--for it was a\r\nnarrow gauge and more or less a surface line--the rate of progress was\r\nmuch less during the greater part of the journey.\r\n\r\nThe work of the day was over.  My companion and I had dined at the\r\nGweedore Hotel, where we were staying for the night.  With the setting\r\nsun the breeze had died away.  Perfect stillness and a silence deep,\r\nprofound and all-pervading reigned.  I had been talking, as an old\r\npensioner will talk, of byegone times, of my experiences in a long\r\nrailway career, and my companion, himself a rising railway man, seemed\r\ngreatly interested.  As we sauntered along, the conversation now and\r\nagain lapsing into a companionable silence, he suddenly said: \"Why don't\r\nyou write your reminiscences?  They would be very interesting, not only\r\nto us younger railway men, but to men of your own time too.\"  Until that\r\nmoment I had never seriously thought of putting my reminiscences on\r\nrecord, but my friend's words fell on favourable ground, and now, less\r\nthan a month since that night in Donegal, I am sitting at my desk penning\r\nthese opening lines.\r\n\r\nThat my undertaking will not be an easy one I know.  My memory is well\r\nstored, but unfortunately I have never kept a diary or commonplace book\r\nof any kind.  On the contrary a love of order and neatness, carried to\r\nabsurd excess, has always led me to destroy accumulated letters or\r\ndocuments, and much that would be useful now has in the past, from time\r\nto time, been destroyed and \"cast as rubbish to the void.\"\r\n\r\nMost autobiographies, I suppose, are undertaken to please the writers.\r\nThat this is the case with me I frankly confess; but I hope that what I\r\nfind much pleasure in writing my readers may, at least, find some\r\nsatisfaction in reading.  Vanity, perhaps, plays some part in this hope,\r\nfor, \"He that is pleased with himself easily imagines that he shall\r\nplease others.\"\r\n\r\nCarlyle says, \"A true delineation of the smallest man, and his scene of\r\npilgrimage through life, is capable of interesting the greatest man; that\r\nall men are to an unspeakable degree brothers, each man's life a strange\r\nemblem of every man's; and that human portraits, faithfully drawn, are of\r\nall pictures the welcomest on human walls.\"\r\n\r\nI am not sure that portraits of the artist by himself, though there are\r\nnotable and noble instances to the contrary, are often successful.  We\r\nrarely \"see oursels as ithers see us,\" and are inclined to regard our\r\nvirtues and our vices with equal equanimity, and to paint ourselves in\r\ntoo alluring colours; but I will do my best to tell my tale with strict\r\nveracity, and with all the modesty I can muster.\r\n\r\nAn autobiographer, too, exposes himself to the charge of egotism, but I\r\nmust run the risk of that, endeavouring to avoid the scathing criticism\r\nof him who wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"The egotist . . . . . . .\r\n   Whose I's and Me's are scattered in his talk,\r\n   Thick as the pebbles on a gravel walk.\"\r\n\r\nFifty years of railway life, passed in the service of various companies,\r\nlarge and small, in England, Scotland and Ireland, in divers' capacities,\r\nfrom junior clerk to general manager, and ultimately to the ease and\r\ndignity of director, if faithfully presented, may perhaps, in spite of\r\nall drawbacks, be not entirely devoid of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nBOYHOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born at Sheffield, on Good Friday, in the year 1851, and my only\r\nsister was born on a Christmas Day.\r\n\r\nMy father was in the service of the Midland Railway, as also were two of\r\nhis brothers, one of whom was the father of the present General Manager\r\nof the Midland.  When I was but ten months old my father was promoted to\r\nthe position of accountants' inspector at headquarters and removed from\r\nSheffield to Derby.  Afterwards, whilst I was still very young, he became\r\nGoods Agent at Birmingham, and lived there for a few years.  He then\r\nreturned to Derby, where he became head of the Mineral Office.  He\r\nremained with the Midland until 1897, when he retired on superannuation\r\nat the age of seventy-six.  Except, therefore, for an interval of about\r\nthree years my childhood and youth were spent at Derby.\r\n\r\nMy earliest recollection in connection with railways is my first railway\r\njourney, which took place when I was four years of age.  I recollect it\r\nwell.  It was from Derby to Birmingham.  How the wonder of it all\r\nimpressed me!  The huge engine, the wonderful carriages, the imposing\r\nguard, the busy porters and the bustling station.  The engine, no doubt,\r\nwas a pigmy, compared with the giants of to-day; the carriages were\r\nsmall, modest four-wheelers, with low roofs, and diminutive windows after\r\nthe manner of old stage coaches, but to me they were palatial.  I\r\ntravelled first-class on a pass with my father, and great was my juvenile\r\npride.  Our luggage, I remember, was carried on the roof of the carriage\r\nin the good old-fashioned coaching style.  Four-wheeled railway carriages\r\nare, I was going to say, a thing of the past; but that is not so.  Though\r\ngradually disappearing, many are running still, mainly on branch lines--in\r\nEngland nearly five thousand; in Scotland over four hundred; and in poor\r\nbackward Ireland (where, by the way, railways are undeservedly abused)\r\nhow many?  Will it be believed--practically none, not more than twenty in\r\nthe whole island!  All but those twenty have been scrapped long ago.  Well\r\ndone Ireland!\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest time I can remember, and until well-advanced in\r\nmanhood, I was delicate in health, troubled with a constant cough, thin\r\nand pale.  In consequence I was often absent from school; and prevented\r\nalso from sharing, as I should, and as every child should, in out-door\r\ngames and exercises, to my great disadvantage then and since, for\r\nproficiency is only gained by early training, and unfortunate is he whose\r\ncircumstances have deprived him of that advantage.  How often, since\r\nthose early days, have I looked with envious eyes on pastimes in which I\r\ncould not engage, or only engage with the consciousness of inferiority.\r\n\r\nI have known men who, handicapped in this way, have in after life, by\r\nstrong will and great application, overcome their disabilities and become\r\ngood cricketers, great at tennis, proficient at golf, strong swimmers,\r\nskilful shots; but they have been exceptional men with a strong natural\r\ninclination to athletics.\r\n\r\nThe only active physical recreations in which I have engaged with any\r\ndegree of pleasure are walking, riding, bicycling and skating.  Riding I\r\ntook to readily enough as soon as I was able to afford it; and, if my\r\nmeans had ever allowed indulgence in the splendid pastime of hunting, I\r\nwould have followed the hounds, not, I believe, without some spirit and\r\nboldness.  My natural disposition I know inclined me to sedentary\r\npursuits: reading, writing, drawing, painting, though, happily, the\r\ntendency was corrected to some extent by a healthy love of Nature's fair\r\nfeatures, and a great liking for country walks.\r\n\r\nIn drawing and painting, though I had a certain natural aptitude for\r\nboth, I never attained much proficiency in either, partly for lack of\r\ninstruction, partly from want of application, but more especially, I\r\nbelieve, because another, more alluring, more mentally exciting\r\noccupation beguiled me.  It was not music, though to music close allied.\r\nThis new-found joy I long pursued in secret, afraid lest it should be\r\ndiscovered and despised as a folly.  It was not until I lived in\r\nScotland, where poetical taste and business talent thrive side by side,\r\nand where, as Mr. Spurgeon said, \"no country in the world produced so\r\nmany poets,\" that I became courageous, and ventured to avow my dear\r\ndelight.  It was there that I sought, with some success, publication in\r\nvarious papers and magazines of my attempts at versification, for\r\nversification it was that so possessed my fancy.  Of the spacious times\r\nof great Elizabeth it has been written, \"the power of action and the gift\r\nof song did not exclude each other,\" but in England, in mid-Victorian\r\ndays, it was looked upon differently, or so at least I believed.\r\n\r\nAfter a time I had the distinction of being included in a new edition of\r\n_Recent and Living Scottish Poets_, by Alexander Murdoch, published in\r\n1883.  My inclusion was explained on the ground that, \"His muse first\r\nawoke to conscious effort on Scottish soil,\" which, though not quite in\r\naccordance with fact, was not so wide of the mark that I felt in the\r\nleast concerned to criticise the statement.  I was too much enamoured of\r\nthe honour to question the foundation on which it rested.  Perhaps it was\r\nas well deserved as are some others of this world's distinctions!  At any\r\nrate it was neither begged nor bought, but came \"Like Dian's kiss,\r\nunasked, unsought.\"  In the same year (1883) I also appeared in\r\n_Edwards_' Sixth Series of _Modern Scottish Poets_; and in 1885, more\r\nlegitimately, in William Andrews' book on _Modern Yorkshire Poets_.  My\r\nclaim for this latter distinction was not, however, any greater, if as\r\ngreat, as my right to inclusion in the collection of _Scottish Poets_.  If\r\nI \"lisped in numbers,\" it was not in Yorkshire, for Yorkshire I left for\r\never before even the first babblings of babyhood began.  However,\r\n\"kissing goes by favour,\" and I was happy in the favour I enjoyed.\r\n\r\nI may as well say it here: with my poetical productions I was never\r\nsatisfied any more than with my attempts at drawing.  My verses seemed\r\nmere farthing dips compared with the resplendent poetry of our country\r\nwhich I read and loved, but my efforts employed and brightened many an\r\nhour in my youth that otherwise would have been tedious and dreary.\r\n\r\nOurs was a large family, nine children in all; nothing unusual in those\r\ndays.  \"A quiver full\" was then a matter of parental pride.  Woman was\r\nmore satisfied with home life then than now.  The pursuit of pleasure was\r\nnot so keen.  Our parents and our grandparents were simpler in their\r\ntastes, more easily amused, more readily impressed with the wonderful and\r\nthe strange.  Things that would leave us unmoved were to them matters of\r\nmoment.  Railways were new and railway travelling was, to most people, an\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nOur fathers talked of their last journey to London, their visit to the\r\nTower, to Westminster Abbey, the Monument, Madame Tussauds; how they\r\nmistook the waxwork policeman for a real member of the force; how they\r\nshuddered in the _Chamber of Horrors_; how they travelled on the new\r\nUnderground Railway; and saw the wonders of the Crystal Palace,\r\nespecially on fireworks night.  They told us of their visit to the _Great\r\nEastern_, what a gigantic ship it was, what a marvel, and described its\r\nevery feature.  They talked of General Tom Thumb, of Blondin, of Pepper's\r\nGhost, of the Christy Minstrels.  Nowadays, a father will return from\r\nLondon and not even mention the Tubes to his children.  Why should he?\r\nThey know all about them and are surprised at nothing.  The picture books\r\nand the cinemas have familiarised them with every aspect of modern life.\r\n\r\nIn those days our pleasures and our amusements were fewer, but impressed\r\nus more.  I remember how eagerly the coloured pictures of the Christmas\r\nnumbers of the pictorial papers were looked forward to, talked of,\r\ncriticised, admired, framed and hung up.  I remember too, the excitements\r\nof Saint Valentine's Day, Shrove Tuesday, April Fool's Day, May Day and\r\nthe Morris (Molly) dancers; and the Fifth of November, Guy Fawkes Day.  I\r\nremember also the peripatetic knife grinder and his trundling machine,\r\nthe muffin man, the pedlar and his wares, the furmity wheat vendor, who\r\ntrudged along with his welcome cry of \"Frummitty!\" from door to door.\r\nThose were pleasant and innocent excitements.  We have other things to\r\nengage us now, but I sometimes think all is not _gain_ that the march of\r\nprogress brings.\r\n\r\nYoung people then had fewer books to read, but read them thoroughly.  What\r\nexcitement and discussion attended the monthly instalments of Dickens'\r\nnovels in _All the Year Round_; how eagerly they were looked for.  Lucky\r\nhe or she who had heard the great _master_ read himself in public.  His\r\nbooks were read in our homes, often aloud to the family circle by\r\npaterfamilias, and moved us to laughter or tears.  I never now see our\r\nyoung people, or their elders either, affected by an author as we were\r\nthen by the power of Dickens.  He was a new force and his pages kindled\r\nin our hearts a vivid feeling for the poor and their wrongs.\r\n\r\nScott's _Waverley Novels_, too, aroused our enthusiasm.  In the early\r\nsixties a cheap edition appeared, and cheap editions were rare things\r\nthen.  It was published, if I remember aright, at two shillings per\r\nvolume; an event that stirred the country.  My father brought each volume\r\nhome as it came out.  I remember it well; a pale, creamy-coloured paper\r\ncover, good type, good paper.  What treasures they were, and only two\r\nshillings!  I was a little child when an important movement for the\r\ncheapening of books began.  In 1852 Charles Dickens presided at a meeting\r\nof authors and others against the coercive regulations of the\r\nBooksellers' Association which maintained their excessive profits.\r\nHerbert Spencer and Miss Evans (George Eliot) took a prominent part in\r\nthis meeting and drafted the resolutions which were passed.  The ultimate\r\neffect of this meeting was that the question between the authors and the\r\nbooksellers was referred to Lord Campbell as arbitrator.  He gave a\r\ndecision against the booksellers; and there were consequently abolished\r\nsuch of the trade regulations as had interdicted the sale of books at\r\nlower rates of profit than those authorised by the Booksellers'\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nPractically all my school days were spent at Derby.  As I have said, ours\r\nwas a large family.  I have referred to an only sister, but I had step-\r\nsisters and step-brothers too.  My father married twice and the second\r\nfamily was numerous.  His salary was never more than 300 pounds a year,\r\nand though a prudent enough man, he was not of the frugal economical sort\r\nwho makes the most of every shilling.  It may be imagined, then, that all\r\nthe income was needed for a family that, parents included, but excluding\r\nthe one servant, numbered eleven.  The consequence was that the education\r\nI received could not be described as liberal.  I attended a day school at\r\nDerby, connected with the Wesleyans; why I do not know, as we belonged to\r\nthe Anglican Church; but I believe it was because the school, while cheap\r\nas to fees, had the reputation of giving a good, plain education suitable\r\nfor boys destined for railway work.  It was a good sized school of about\r\na hundred boys.  Not long ago I met one day in London a business man who,\r\nit turned out, was at this school with me.  We had not met for fifty\r\nyears.  \"Well,\" said he, \"I think old Jessie, if he did not teach us a\r\ngreat variety of things, what he did he taught well.\"  My new-found old\r\nschoolmate had become the financial manager of a great business house\r\nhaving ramifications throughout the world.  He had attained to position\r\nand wealth and, which successful men sometimes are not, was quite\r\nunspoiled.  We revived our schooldays with mutual pleasure, and lunched\r\ntogether as befitted the occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Jessie\" was the name by which our old schoolmaster was endeared to his\r\nboys; a kindly, simple-minded, worthy man, teaching, as well as\r\nscholastic subjects, behaviour, morals, truth, loyalty; and these as much\r\nby example as by precept, impressing ever upon us the virtue of\r\nthoroughness in all we did and of truth in all we said.  Since those days\r\nI have seen many youths, educated at much finer and more pretentious\r\nschools, who have benefited by modern educational methods, and on whose\r\neducation much money has been expended, and who, when candidates for\r\nclerkships, have, in the simple matters of reading, writing, arithmetic,\r\ncomposition and spelling, shown up very poorly compared to what almost\r\nany boy from \"old Jessie's\" unambitious establishment would have done.\r\nBut, plain and substantial as my schooling was, I have ever felt that I\r\nwas defrauded of the better part of education--the classics, languages,\r\nliterature and modern science, which furnish the mind and extend the\r\nboundaries of thought.\r\n\r\n\"Jessie\" continued his interest in his boys long after they left school.\r\nHe was proud of those who made their way.  I remember well the warmth of\r\nhis greeting and the kind look of his mild blue eyes when, after I had\r\ngone out into the world, I sometimes revisited him.\r\n\r\nBut my school life was not all happiness.  In the school there was an\r\nalmost brutal element of roughness, and fights were frequent; not only in\r\nour own, but between ours and neighbouring schools.  Regular pitched\r\nbattles were fought with sticks and staves and stones.  I shrunk from\r\nfighting but could not escape it.  Twice in our own playground I was\r\nforced to fight.  Every new boy had to do it, sooner or later.\r\nFortunately on the second occasion I came off victor, much to my\r\nsurprise.  How I managed to beat my opponent I never could understand.\r\nAnyhow the victory gave me a better standing in the school, though it did\r\nnot lessen in the least my hatred of the battles that raged periodically\r\nwith other schools.  I never had to fight again except as an unwilling\r\nparticipant in our foreign warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHE MIDLAND RAILWAY AND \"KING HUDSON\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1851 the Midland Railway was 521 miles long; it is now 2,063.\r\nThen its capital was 15,800,000, against 130,000,000 pounds to-day.  Then\r\nthe gross revenue was 1,186,000 and now it has reached 15,960,000 pounds.\r\nWhen I say _now_, I refer to 1913, the year prior to the war, as since\r\nthen, owing to Government control, non-division of through traffic and\r\ncurtailment of accounts, the actual receipts earned by individual\r\ncompanies are not published, and, indeed, are not known.\r\n\r\nEighteen hundred and fifty-one was a period of anxiety to the Midland and\r\nto railway companies generally.  Financial depression had succeeded a\r\ntime of wild excitement, and the Midland dividend had fallen from seven\r\nto two per cent.!  It was the year of the great Exhibition, which Lord\r\nCholmondeley considered _the_ event of modern times and many\r\nover-sanguine people expected it to inaugurate a universal peace.  On the\r\nother hand Carlyle uttered fierce denunciations against it.  It certainly\r\nexcited far more interest than has any exhibition since.  Then, nothing\r\nof the kind had ever before been seen.  Railway expectations ran high;\r\nimmense traffic receipts, sorely needed, ought to have swelled the\r\ncoffers of the companies.  But no! vast numbers of people certainly\r\ntravelled to London, but a mad competition, as foolish almost as the\r\npreceding _mania_, set in, and passenger fares were again and again\r\nreduced, till expected profits disappeared and loss and disappointment\r\nwere the only result.  The policy of Parliament in encouraging the\r\nconstruction of rival railway routes and in fostering competition in the\r\nsupposed interest of the public was, even in those early days, bearing\r\nfruit--dead sea fruit, as many a luckless holder of railway stock learned\r\nto his cost.\r\n\r\nRailway shareholders throughout the kingdom were growing angry.  In the\r\ncase of the Midland--they appointed a committee of inquiry, and the\r\ndirectors assented to the appointment.  This committee was to examine and\r\nreport upon the general and financial conditions of the company, and was\r\ninvested with large powers.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time also interviews took place between the Midland and\r\nthe London and North-Western, with the object of arranging an\r\namalgamation of the two systems.  Some progress was made, but no formal\r\n_engagement_ resulted, and so a very desirable union, between an\r\naristocratic bridegroom and a democratic bride, remained unaccomplished.\r\n\r\nMr. Ellis was chairman of the Midland at this time and Mr. George Carr\r\nGlyn, afterwards the first Lord Wolverton, occupied a similar position on\r\nthe Board of the London and North-Western.  Mr. Ellis had succeeded Mr.\r\nHudson--the \"_Railway King_,\" so christened by Sydney Smith.  Mr. Hudson\r\nin 1844 was chairman of the first shareholders' meeting of the Midland\r\nRailway.  Prior to that date the Midland consisted of three separate\r\nrailways.  In 1849 Mr. Hudson presided for the last time at a Midland\r\nmeeting, and in the following year resigned his office of chairman of the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe story of the meteoric reign of the \"_Railway King_\" excited much\r\ninterest when I was young, and it may not be out of place to touch upon\r\nsome of the incidents of his career.\r\n\r\nGeorge Hudson was born in 1800, served his apprenticeship in the\r\ncathedral city of York and subsequently became a linendraper there and a\r\nman of property.\r\n\r\nMany years afterwards he is reported to have said that the happiest days\r\nof his life passed while he stood behind his counter using the yardstick,\r\na statement which should perhaps only be accepted under reservation.  He\r\nwas undoubtedly a man of a bold and adventurous spirit, possessed of an\r\nambition which soared far above the measuring of calicoes or the\r\nretailing of ribbons; but perhaps the observation was tinged by the\r\nenvironment of later and less happy days when his star had set, his\r\nkingly reign come to an end, and when possibly vain regrets had\r\nembittered his existence.  It was, I should imagine, midst the fierceness\r\nof the strife and fury of the _mania_ times, when his powerful\r\npersonality counted for so much, that he reached the zenith of his\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n[George Hudson: hudson.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhilst conducting in York his linendraper business, a relation died and\r\nleft him money.  The railway boom had then begun.  He flung his yardstick\r\nbehind him and entered the railway fray.  The Liverpool and Manchester\r\nline and its wonderful success--it paid ten per cent.--greatly impressed\r\nthe public mind, and the good people of York determined they would have a\r\nrailway to London.\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed to carry out the project.  On this committee\r\nMr. Hudson was placed, and it was mainly owing to his energy and skill\r\nthat the scheme came to a successful issue.  He was rewarded by being\r\nmade chairman of the company.\r\n\r\nThis was his entrance into the railway world where, for a time, he was\r\nmonarch.  He must have been a man of shrewdness and capacity.  It is\r\nrecorded that he acquired the land for the York to London railway at an\r\naverage cost of 1,750 pounds per mile whilst that of the North Midland\r\ncost over 5,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st July, 1840, this linendraper of York had the proud pleasure of\r\nseeing the first train from York to London start on its journey.\r\n\r\nFrom this achievement he advanced to others.  He and his friends obtained\r\nthe lease, for thirty-one years, of a rival line, which turned out a\r\ngreat financial success.  His enterprise and energy were boundless.\r\n\r\nIt is said that his bold spirit, his capacity for work and his great\r\ninfluence daunted his most determined opponents.  For instance, the North\r\nMidland railway, part predecessor of _the_ Midland, was involved in\r\ndifficulty.  He appeared before the shareholders, offered, if his advice\r\nand methods were adopted, to guarantee double the then dividend.  His\r\noffer was accepted and he was made chairman, and from that position\r\nbecame chairman, and for a time dictator, of the amalgamated Midland\r\nsystem.  Clearly his business abilities were great; his reforms were bold\r\nand drastic, and success attended his efforts.  He soon became the\r\ngreatest railway authority in England.  For a time the entire railway\r\nsystem in the north was under his control, and the confidence reposed in\r\nhim was unbounded.  He was the lion of the day: princes, peers and\r\nprelates, capitalists and fine ladies sought his society, paid homage to\r\nhis power, besought his advice and lavished upon him unstinted adulation.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 the railway mania was at its height.  It is said that during two\r\nor three months of that year as much as 100,000 pounds per week were\r\nexpended in advertisements in connection with railway promotions, railway\r\nmeetings and railway matters generally.  Scarcely credible this, but so\r\nit is seriously stated.  Huge sums were wasted in the promotion and\r\nconstruction of British railways in early days, from which, in their\r\nexcessive capital cost, they suffer now.  In the _mania_ period railways\r\nsprang into existence so quickly that, to use the words of Robert\r\nStephenson, they \"appeared like the realisation of fabled powers or the\r\nmagician's wand.\"  The _Illustrated London News_ of the day said:\r\n\"Railway speculation has become the sole object of the world--cupidity is\r\naroused and roguery shields itself under its name, as a more safe and\r\nrapid way of gaining its ends.  Abroad, as well as at home, has it proved\r\nthe rallying point of all rascality--the honest man is carried away by\r\nthe current and becomes absorbed in the vortex; the timid, the quiet, the\r\nmoral are, after some hesitation, caught in the whirlpool and follow\r\nthose whom they have watched with pity and derision.\"\r\n\r\nPowers were granted by Parliament in the year 1845 to construct no less\r\nthan 2,883 miles of new railway at an expenditure of about 44,000,000\r\npounds; and in the next year (1846) applications were made to Parliament\r\nfor authority to raise 389,000,000 pounds for the construction of further\r\nlines.  These powers were granted to the extent of 4,790 miles at a cost\r\nof about 120,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nSoon there came a change; disaster followed success; securities fell;\r\ndividends diminished or disappeared altogether or, as was in some cases\r\ndiscovered, were paid out of capital, and disappointment and ruin\r\nfollowed.  King Hudson's methods came under a fierce fire of criticism;\r\nadulation was succeeded by abuse and he was disgraced and dethroned.  A\r\nwriter of the day said, \"Mr. Hudson is neither better nor worse than the\r\nmorality of his time.\"  From affluence he came to want, and in his old\r\nage a fund was raised sufficient to purchase him an annuity of 600 pounds\r\na year.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, that most useful Institution the Railway Clearing House\r\nreceived Parliamentary sanction.  The _Railway Clearing System Act_ 1850\r\ngave it statutory recognition.  Its functions have been defined thus: \"To\r\nsettle and adjust the receipts arising from railway traffic within, or\r\npartly within, the United Kingdom, and passing over more than one railway\r\nwithin the United Kingdom, booked or invoiced at throughout rates of\r\nfares.\"  The system had then been in existence, in a more or less\r\ninformal way, for about eight years.  Mr. Allport, on one occasion, said\r\nthat whilst he was with the Birmingham and Derby railway (before he\r\nbecame general manager of the Midland) the process of settlement of\r\nreceipts for through traffic was tedious and difficult, and it occurred\r\nto him that a system should be adopted similar to that which existed in\r\nLondon and was known as the Bankers' Clearing House.  It was also said\r\nthat Mr. Kenneth Morrison, Auditor of the London and Birmingham line, was\r\nthe first to see and proclaim the necessity for a Clearing House.  Be\r\nthat as it may, the Railway Clearing House, as a practical entity, came\r\ninto being in 1842.  In the beginning it only embraced nine companies,\r\nand six people were enough to do its work.  The companies were:--\r\n\r\n   London and Birmingham, Midland Counties, Birmingham and Derby, North\r\n   Midland, Leeds and Selby, York and North Midland, Hull and Selby,\r\n   Great North of England, Manchester and Leeds.\r\n\r\nNot one of these has preserved its original name.  All have been merged\r\nin either the London and North-Western, the North-Eastern, the Midland or\r\nthe Lancashire and Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the Clearing House consists of practically the whole\r\nof the railway companies in the United Kingdom, though some of the small\r\nand unimportant lines are outside its sphere.  Ireland has a Railway\r\nClearing House of its own--established in the year 1848--to which\r\npractically all Irish railway companies, and they are numerous, belong;\r\nand the six principal Irish railways are members of the London Clearing\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThe English house, situated in Seymour Street, Euston Square, is an\r\nextensive establishment, and accommodates 2,500 clerks.  As I write, the\r\nnumber under its roof is, by war conditions, reduced to about 900.\r\nServing with His Majesty's Forces are nearly 1,200, and about 400 have\r\nbeen temporarily transferred to the railway companies, to the Government\r\nservice and to munition factories.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, when the Clearing House first began, the staff, as I have said,\r\nnumbered six, and the companies nine.  Fifty-eight railway companies now\r\nbelong to the House, and the amount of money dealt with by way of\r\ndivision and apportionment in the year before the war was 31,071,910\r\npounds.  In 1842 it was 193,246 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nFASHIONS AND MANNERS, VICTORIAN DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boy who is strong and healthy, overflowing with animal spirits,\r\nenjoys life in a way that is denied to his slighter-framed, more delicate\r\nbrother.  Exercise imparts to him a physical exuberance to which the\r\nother is a stranger.  But Nature is kind.  If she withholds her gifts in\r\none direction she bestows them in another.  She grants the enjoyment of\r\nsedentary pursuits to those to whom she has denied hardier pleasures.\r\n\r\nDuring my schooldays I spent many happy hours alone with book or pen or\r\npencil.  My father was fond of reading, and for a man of his limited\r\nmeans, possessed a good collection of books; a considerable number of the\r\nvolumes of _Bohn's Standard Library_ as well as _Boswell's Life of\r\nJohnson, Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, Butler's Hudibras, Bailey's\r\nFestus, Gil Blas, Don Quixote, Pilgrim's Progress, the Arabian Nights,\r\nShakespeare_, most of the poets from _Chaucer_ down; and of novels,\r\n_Bulwer Lytton's, Scott's, Dickens_' and _Thackeray's_.  These are the\r\nbooks I best remember, but there were others of classic fame, and I read\r\nthem all; but not, I fear to much advantage, for though I have read many\r\nbooks it has been without much method, just as fancy led, and study,\r\nmemory and judgment have been little considered.  Still, unsystematic\r\nreading is better than no reading, and, as someone has said, \"a phrase\r\nmay fructify if it falls on receptive soil.\"\r\n\r\nI never in my boyhood or youth, except on short visits to relatives,\r\nenjoyed the advantage, by living in the country, of becoming intimate\r\nwith rural life.  We resided at Derby in a terrace on the outskirt of the\r\ntown, much to my dislike, for monotonous rows of houses I have ever\r\nhated.  One's home should be one's friend and possess some special\r\nfeature of its own, even in its outward aspect, to love and remember.  As\r\nGeorge Eliot says: \"We get the fonder of our houses if they have a\r\nphysiognomy of their own, as our friends have.\"\r\n\r\nIn my schooldays, country walks, pursued as far as health and strength\r\nallowed, were my greatest pleasure, sometimes taken alone, sometimes with\r\na companion.  The quiet valley of the Trent at Repton, Anchor Church,\r\nKnoll Hills, the long bridge at Swarkestone, the charming little country\r\ntown of Melbourne, the wooded beauties of Duffield and Belper, the ozier\r\nbeds of Spondon; how often have I trod their fields, their woods, their\r\nlanes, their paths; and how pleasantly the memory of it all comes back to\r\nme now!\r\n\r\nIn those days fashions and manners differed greatly from those of to-day.\r\nLadies wore the crinoline (successor to the hoop of earlier times),\r\nchignons and other absurdities, but had not ventured upon short skirts or\r\ncigarettes.  They were much given to blushing, now a lost art; and to\r\nswooning, a thing of the past; the \"vapours\" of the eighteenth century\r\nhad, happily, vanished for ever; but athletic exercises, such as girls\r\nenjoy to-day, were then undreamed of.  Why has the pretty art of blushing\r\ngone?  One now never sees a blush to mantle on the cheek of beauty.  Does\r\nthe blood of feminine youth flow steadier than it did, or has the more\r\nunrestrained intercourse of the sexes banished the sweet consciousness\r\nthat so often brought the crimson to a maiden's face?  The manners of\r\nmaidens had more of reserve and formality then.  The off-hand style, the\r\nnod of the head, the casual \"how d'ye do,\" were unknown.  Woman has not\r\nnow the same desire to appear always graceful; she adopts a manly gait,\r\ntalks louder, plays hockey, rides horseback astride, and boldly enters\r\nhotel smoking rooms and railway smoking compartments without apology.\r\n\r\nWhen walking with a lady, old or young, in those days, the gentleman\r\nwould offer his arm and she would take it.  The curtsey was still\r\nobserved but gradually disappearing.  When about nineteen years of age, I\r\nremember being introduced to one of the young beauties of the town, who I\r\nhad long secretly admired.  She made me a profound and graceful\r\ncurtsey--feminine homage to my budding manhood.  The first curtsey I\r\nremember receiving, except of course in the stately ceremonies of the\r\ndance.  For many a day afterwards my cheek glowed with pleasure at the\r\nrecollection of that sweet obeisance.  She became my sweetheart,\r\ntemporarily; but a born butterfly, she soon fluttered away, leaving me\r\ndisconsolate--_for a time_!\r\n\r\nWomen then wrote a sloping hand, delicate penmanship, to distinguish them\r\nfrom men; crossed and re-crossed their letters, and were greatly addicted\r\nto postscripts.\r\n\r\nThe men?  Well, they wore mutton chop whiskers, or, if Nature was\r\nbountiful, affected the Dundreary style, which gave a man great\r\ndistinction, and, if allied to good looks, made him perfectly\r\nirresistible.  They wore \"Champagne Charley\" coats, fancy waistcoats,\r\nfrilled-fronted shirts, relic of the lace and ruffles of Elizabeth's\r\ndays; velvet smoking caps, embroidered slippers, elastic-side boots and\r\nchimney pot hats.\r\n\r\nAt eighteen years of age I had my first frock coat and tall hat.  Some of\r\nmy companions, happy youths! enjoyed this distinction at sixteen or\r\nseventeen.  These adornments were of course for Sunday wear; no weekday\r\nclothes were worn on Sundays then.  My frock coat was of West of England\r\nbroadcloth, shiny and smooth.  Sunday attire was incomplete without light\r\nkid gloves, lavender or lemon being the favourite shade for a young man\r\nwith any pretension to style.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to my first frock coat ranked my first portmanteau; it\r\nwas a present, and supplanted the carpet bag which, up to then, to my\r\nprofound disgust, I had to use on visits to my relatives.  The\r\nportmanteau was the sign of youth and progress; old-fashioned people\r\nstuck to the carpet bag.\r\n\r\nMan's attire has changed for the better; and woman's, with all its\r\nabbreviations and shortcomings, is, on the whole, more rational; though\r\nin the domain of Fashion her _vagaries_ will last no doubt as long\r\nas--woman is woman; and if ever that shall cease to be, the charm of life\r\nwill be over.\r\n\r\nWith man the jacket suit, the soft hat, the soft shirt, the turn-down\r\ncollar, mark the transition from starch and stiffness to ease and\r\ncomfort; and Time in his course has brought no greater boon than this;\r\nexcept, perhaps, the change that marks our funeral customs.  In those\r\ndays, hatbands, gloves and scarves were provided by the bereaved family\r\nto the relatives and friends who attended the obsequies; and all of\r\nkinship close or remote, were invited from far and near.  Hearse and\r\ncoaches and nodding plumes and mutes added to the expense, and many a\r\nfamily of moderate means suffered terrible privation from the costliness\r\nof these burial customs, which, happily, now are fast disappearing.\r\n\r\nBeds, in those days, were warmed with copper warming pans, and nightcaps\r\nadorned the slumbering heads of both sexes.  Spittoons were part of\r\nordinary household furniture.  To colour a meerschaum was the ambition of\r\nsmokers, swearing was considered neither low nor vulgar, and snuffing was\r\nfashionable.  Many most respectable men chewed tobacco, and to carry\r\none's liquor well was a gentlemanly accomplishment.\r\n\r\nGarrotters pursued their calling, deterred only by the cat-o'-nine tails,\r\npickpockets abounded and burglaries were common.\r\n\r\nThe antimacassar and the family album; in what veneration they were held!\r\nThe antimacassar, as its name implies, was designed to protect chairs and\r\ncouches from the disfiguring stains of macassar oil, then liberally used\r\nin the adornment of the hair which received much attention.  A parting,\r\nof geometrical precision, at the back of the head was often affected by\r\nmen of dressy habits, who sometimes also wore a carefully arranged curl\r\nat the front; and manly locks, if luxuriant enough, were not infrequently\r\npermitted to fall in careless profusion over the collar of the coat.\r\n\r\nOf the family album I would rather not speak.  It is scarcely yet\r\nextinct.  A respectable silence shall accompany its departing days.\r\n\r\nPerhaps these things may to some appear mere trivialities; but to recall\r\nthem awakens many memories, brings back thoughts of bygone days--days\r\nillumined with the sunshine of Youth and Hope on which it is pleasant to\r\nlinger.  As someone has finely said: \"We lose a proper sense of the\r\nrichness of life if we do not look back on the scenes of our youth with\r\nimagination and warmth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nEARLY OFFICE LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1867, at the age of sixteen, I became a junior clerk in the\r\nMidland Railway at Derby, at a salary of 15 pounds a year.\r\n\r\nFrom pre-natal days I was destined for the railway service, as an oyster\r\nto its shell.  The possibility of any other vocation for his sons never\r\nentered the mind of my father, nor the mind of many another father in the\r\ntown of Derby.\r\n\r\nMy railway life began on a drizzling dismal day in the early autumn.  My\r\nfather took me to the office in which I was to make a start and presented\r\nme to the chief clerk.  I was a tall, thin, delicate, shy, sensitive\r\nyouth, with curly hair, worn rather long, and I am sure I did not look at\r\nall a promising specimen for encountering the rough and tumble of railway\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe chief clerk handed me over to one of his assistants, who without\r\nceremony seated me on a tall stool at a high desk, and put before me, to\r\nmy great dismay, a huge pile of formidable documents which he called _Way\r\nBills_.  He gave me some instructions, but I was too confused to\r\nunderstand them, and too shy to ask questions.  I only know that I felt\r\nvery miserable and hopelessly at sea.  Visions of being dismissed as an\r\nincompetent rose before me; but soon, to my great relief, it was\r\ndiscovered that the Way Bills were too much for me and that I must begin\r\nat more elementary duties.\r\n\r\nA few weeks afterwards, when I had found my feet a little, I was promoted\r\nfrom the simple tasks assigned to me in consequence of my first failure\r\nand attached to the goods-train-delays clerk, a long-bearded elderly man\r\nwith a very kind face.  He was quite fatherly to me and took a great deal\r\nof trouble in teaching me my work.  With him I soon felt at ease, and was\r\nhappy in gaining his approbation.  One thing found favour in his eyes; I\r\nwrote a good clear hand and at fair speed.  In those days penmanship was\r\na fine art.  No cramped or sprawling writing passed muster.  Typewriting\r\nwas not dreamed of, and, at Derby, shorthand had not appeared on the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nOne or two other juniors and myself sedulously practised imitating the\r\npenmanship of those senior clerks who wrote fine or singular hands.  At\r\nthis I was particularly successful and proud of my skill, until one day\r\nthe chief clerk detained me after closing time, gave me a good rating,\r\nand warned me to stop such a dangerous habit which might lead, he said,\r\nto the disgrace of forgery.  He spoke so seriously and shook his head so\r\nwisely that (to use Theodore Hook's old joke) \"I thought there must be\r\nsomething in it,\" and so, for a long while, I gave up the practice.\r\n\r\nOffice hours in those days were nominally from nine till six, but for the\r\njuniors especially often much longer.  In 1868 or 1869, 1 do not remember\r\nwhich, a welcome change took place; the hours were reduced to from nine\r\ntill five, and arrangements made for avoiding late hours for the juniors.\r\nThis early closing was the result of an \"appeal unto Caesar.\"  The\r\nclerical staff in all the offices had combined and presented a petition\r\nin the highest quarter.  The boon was granted, and I remember the wave of\r\ndelight that swept over us, and how we enjoyed the long summer evenings.\r\nIt was in the summer time the change took place.\r\n\r\nCombined action amongst railway employees was not common then, not even\r\nin the wage-earning class, but Trade Unionism, scarcely yet legalised,\r\nwas clamouring for recognition.  Strikes sometimes occurred but were not\r\nfrequent.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 Mr. James Allport was general manager of the Midland Railway, Mr.\r\nThomas Walklate the goods manager and Mr. William Parker head of the\r\ndepartment in which I began my railway life.  Ned Farmer was a notable\r\nMidland man at that time; notable for his bucolic appearance, his genial\r\npersonality, and, most of all, for the well-known songs he wrote.  He was\r\nin charge of the company's horses, bought them, fed them, cared for them.\r\nHe was a big-bodied, big-hearted, ruddy-faced, farmerlike man of fifty or\r\nso; and the service was proud of him.  He had a great sense of humour and\r\nused to tell many an amusing story.  One morning, he told us, he had been\r\ngreatly tickled by a letter which he had received from one of his\r\ninspectors whose habit it was to conclude every letter and report with\r\nthe words \"to oblige.\"  The letter ran: \"Dear Sir, I beg to inform you\r\nthat Horse No. 99 died last night to oblige Yours truly, John Smith.\"  He\r\nwrote the fine poem of \"_Little Jim_,\" which everyone knew, and which\r\nalmost every boy and girl could recite.  His then well-known song, \"_My\r\nold Wife's a good old cratur_,\" was very popular and was sung throughout\r\nthe Midlands.  The publication of his poems and songs was attended with\r\ngreat success.  His Muse was simple, homely, humorous, pathetic and\r\npatriotic, and made a strong appeal to the natural feelings of ordinary\r\nfolk.  Often it was inspired by incidents and experiences in his daily\r\nlife.  His desk was in the same office as that in which I worked, and I\r\nwas very proud of the notice he took of me, and grateful for many\r\nkindnesses he showed to me.\r\n\r\nAfter spending twelve months or so in Mr. Parker's office, I was removed\r\nto another department.  The office to which I was assigned had about\r\nthirty clerks, all of whom, except the chief clerk, occupied tall stools\r\nat high desks.\r\n\r\nI was one of two assistants to a senior clerk.  This senior was middle-\r\naged, and passing rich on eighty pounds a year.  A quiet, steady,\r\nrespectable married man, well dressed, cheerful, contented, he had by\r\ncare and economy, out of his modest salary, built for himself a snug\r\nlittle double-breasted villa, in a pleasant outskirt of the town, where\r\nhe spent his spare hours in his garden and enjoyed a comfortable and\r\nhappy life.\r\n\r\nExcept the chief clerk, whose salary was about 160 pounds, I do not\r\nbelieve there was another whose pay exceeded 100 pounds a year.  The real\r\nhead of the office, or _department_ it was called, was not the chief\r\nclerk but one who ranked higher still and was styled _Head of\r\nDepartment_, and he received a salary of about 300 pounds.  Moderate\r\nsalaries prevailed, but the sovereign was worth much more then than now,\r\nwhile wants were fewer.  Beer was threepence the pint and tobacco\r\nthreepence the ounce, and beer we drank but never whiskey or wine; and\r\npipes we smoked but not cigars.\r\n\r\nThis chief clerk was an amiable rather ladylike person, with small hands\r\nand feet and well-arranged curly hair.  He was quick and clever and work\r\nsat lightly upon him.  Quiet and good natured, when necessity arose he\r\nnever failed to assert his authority.  We all respected him.  His young\r\nwife was pretty and pleasant, which was in his favour too.\r\n\r\nThe office was by no means altogether composed of steady specimens of\r\nclerkdom, but had a large admixture of lively sparks who, though they\r\nwould never set the Thames on fire, brightened and enlivened our\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nThere was one, a literary genius, who had entered the service, I believe\r\nby influence, for influence and patronage were in those days not unknown.\r\nHe wrote in his spare time the pantomime for a Birmingham theatre; and\r\nthere constantly fluttered from his desk and circulated through the\r\noffice, little scraps of paper containing quips and puns and jokes in\r\nprose or verse, or acrostics from his prolific pen.  One clever acrostic\r\nupon the office boy, which has always remained in my memory, I should\r\nlike for its delicate irony (worthy of Swift himself) to reproduce; but\r\nas that promising youth may still be in the service I feel I had better\r\nnot, as irony sometimes wounds.  For some time we had in the office an\r\nApollo--a very Belvidere.  He was a glory introduced into railway life by\r\nI know not what influence and disappeared after a time I know not where\r\nor why.  A marvel of manly strength and grace and beauty, thirty years of\r\nage or so, and faultlessly dressed.  Said to be aristocratically\r\nconnected, he was the admiration of all and the darling of the young\r\nladies of Derby.  He lodged in fashionable apartments, smoked expensive\r\ncigars, attended all public amusements, was affable and charming, but\r\nreticent about himself.  Why he ever came amongst us none ever knew; it\r\nwas a mystery we never fathomed.  He left as he came, a mystery still.\r\n\r\nThere was an oldish clerk whom we nicknamed _Gumpots_.  This bore some\r\nresemblance to his surname, but there were other reasons which led to the\r\nplayful designation and which I think justified it.\r\n\r\nThere was another scribe of quite an elegant sort: a perambulating\r\ntailor's dummy; a young man, well under thirty.  He was good-looking, as\r\nfar as regularity of features and a well-formed figure went, but mentally\r\nnot much to boast of.  He lounged about the station platform and the town\r\ndisplaying his faultlessly fitting fashionable clothes.  They always\r\nlooked new, and as his salary was not more than 70 pounds a year, and his\r\nparents, with whom he lived, were poor, the story that he was provided\r\ngratis by an enterprising tailor in town with these suits, on condition\r\nthat he exhibited himself constantly in public, and told whenever he\r\ncould who was his outfitter, received general credence, and I believe was\r\ntrue.  He was never known to hurry, mingled little with men and less with\r\nwomen, but moved along in a stiff tailor-dummy fashion with a sort of\r\nself-conscious air which seemed to say, \"Look at my figure and my\r\nclothes, how stylish they are!\"\r\n\r\nI remember a senior clerk in the office where I first worked to whom\r\nthere was a general aversion.  He was the only clerk who was really\r\ndisliked, for all the others, old or young, serious or gay, steady or\r\nrackety, had each some pleasant quality.  This unfortunate fellow had\r\nnone.  He was small, mean, cunning, a sneak and a mischief maker.  He\r\ncarried tales, told lies, and tried to make trouble, for no reason but to\r\ngratify his inclinations.  He was a dark impish looking fellow, as lean\r\nas Cassius and as crafty and envious as Iago.  The chief clerk, to his\r\ncredit be it said, gave a deaf ear to his tales, and his craft and\r\ncunning obtained him little beyond our detestation.\r\n\r\nIn our own office about half our number were youths and single men and\r\nabout half were married.  Our youngest benedict was not more than\r\neighteen years of age, and his salary only 45 pounds a year.  On this\r\nmodest income for a time the young couple lived.  It was a runaway match;\r\non the girl's part an elopement from school.  They lived in apartments,\r\nkept by an old lady, a widow who, being a woman, loved a bit of romance,\r\nand was very kind to them.  He was a manly young fellow, a sportsman and\r\nrenowned at cricket, and she was amiable and pretty, a little blonde\r\nbeauty.  The parents were well to do, and in due time forgave the\r\nimprudent match.  At this we all rejoiced for he was a general favourite.\r\n\r\nLooking back now it seems to me the office staff was in some ways a\r\ncurious collection and very different to the clerks of to-day.  Many of\r\nthem had not entered railway life until nearly middle-age and they had\r\nnot assimilated as an office staff does now, when all join as youths and\r\nare brought up together.  They were original, individual, not to say\r\neccentric.  Whilst our office included certain steady married clerks, who\r\nworked hard and lived ordinary middle-class respectable lives, and some\r\nfew bachelors of quiet habit, the rest were a lively set indeed, by no\r\nmeans free from inclinations to coarse conviviality and many of them\r\nspendthrift, reckless and devil-may-care.  At pay-day, which occurred\r\nmonthly, most of these merry wights, after receiving their pay, betook\r\nthemselves to the _Midland Tap_ or other licensed house and there\r\nindulged, for the remainder of the afternoon, in abundant beer, pouring\r\ndown glass after glass; in Charles Lamb's inimitable words: \"the second\r\nto see where the first has gone, the third to see no harm happens to the\r\nsecond, a fourth to say there is another coming, and a fifth to say he is\r\nnot sure he is the last.\"  Some of the merriest of them would not return\r\nto the office that day but extend their carouse far into the night; to\r\nsadly realise next day that it was \"the morning after the night before.\"\r\n\r\nI do not think our ladylike chief clerk ever indulged in these orgies,\r\nbut I never knew more than the mildest remonstrance being made by him or\r\nby anyone in authority.\r\n\r\nPay-day was also the time for squaring accounts.  \"The human species,\"\r\nCharles Lamb says, \"is composed of two distinct races, the men who borrow\r\nand the men who lend.\"  This was true of our office, but no equal\r\ndivision prevailed as the borrowers predominated and the lenders, the\r\nprudent, were a small minority.  A general settlement took place monthly,\r\nafter which a new period began--by the borrowers with joyous unconcern.\r\n\"Take no thought for the morrow\" was a maxim dear to the heart of these\r\nknights of the pen.\r\n\r\nSwearing, as I have said, was not considered low or vulgar or unbecoming\r\na gentleman.  There was a senior clerk of some standing and position, a\r\nmarried man of thirty-five or forty years of age, who gloried in it.  His\r\nexpletives were varied, vivid and inexhaustible, and the turbid stream\r\nwas easily set flowing.  Had he lived a century earlier he might have\r\nbeen put in the stocks for his profanity, a punishment which magistrates\r\nwere then, by Act of Parliament, empowered to inflict.  He was a strange\r\nindividual.  _Long Jack_ he was called.  He is not in this world now so I\r\nmay write of him with freedom.\r\n\r\nNo one's enemy but his own, he was kindly, good-natured, generous to a\r\nfault, but devil-may-care and reckless; and, at any one's expense, or at\r\nany cost to himself, would have his fling and his joke.\r\n\r\nIt was from his lankiness and length of limb that he was called \"_Long\r\nJack_.\"  He stood about six feet six in his boots.  He must have had\r\nmeans of his own, as he lived in a way far beyond the reach of even a\r\nsenior clerk of the first degree.  How he came to be in a railway office,\r\nor, being in, retained his place, was a matter of wonder.  Sad to tell,\r\nhe had a little daughter, five or six years of age; his only child, a\r\nsweet, blue-eyed golden-haired little fairy, who, never corrected,\r\nimitated her father's profanity, and apparently to his great delight.  He\r\ntreated it as a joke, as he treated everything.  _Long Jack_ loved to\r\nscandalise the town by his eccentricities.  He would compound with the\r\nbutcher, to drive his fast trotting horse and trap and deliver their\r\njoints, their steaks and kidneys to astonished customers, or arrange with\r\nthe milkman to dispense the early morning milk, donning a milkman's\r\nsmock, and carrying two milk-pails on foot.  I remember one _Good Friday_\r\nmorning when he perambulated the town with a donkey cart and sold, at an\r\nearly hour, hot cross buns at the houses of his friends, afterwards\r\ngleefully boasting of having made a good profit on the morning's\r\nbusiness.  In the sixties and early seventies throughout the clerical\r\nstaff of the Midland Railway were many who had not been brought up as\r\nclerks, who, somehow or other had drifted into the service, whose early\r\navocations had been of various kinds, and whose appearance, habits and\r\nmanners imparted a picturesqueness to office life which does not exist to-\r\nday, and among these.  _Long Jack_ was a prominent, but despite his\r\njoviality, it seems to me a pathetic figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nFRIENDSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nDelicate health, as I have said, was my lot from childhood.  After about\r\neighteen months of office work I had a long and serious illness and was\r\naway from duty for nearly half a year.  The latter part of the time I\r\nspent in the Erewash Valley, at the house of an uncle who lived near Pye\r\nBridge.  I was then under eighteen, growing fast, and when convalescing\r\nthe country life and country air did me lasting good.  Though a colliery\r\ndistrict the valley is not devoid of rural beauty; to me it was pleasant\r\nand attractive and I wandered about at will.\r\n\r\nOne day I had a curious experience.  In my walk I came across the\r\nCromford Canal where it enters a tunnel that burrows beneath coal mines.\r\nAt the entrance to the tunnel a canal barge lay.  The bargees asked would\r\nI like to go through with them?  \"How long is it?\" said I, and \"how long\r\nwill it take?\"  \"Not long,\" said bargee, \"come on!\"  \"Right!\" said I.  The\r\ntunnel just fitted the barge, scarcely an inch to spare; the roof was so\r\nlow that a man lying on his back on a plank placed athwart the vessel,\r\nwith his feet against the roof, propelled the boat along.  This was the\r\nonly means of transit and our progress was slow and dreary.  It was a\r\njourney of Cimmerian darkness; along a stream fit for Charon's boat.\r\nAbout halfway a halt was made for dinner, but I had none.  Although I was\r\ncold and hungry the bargees' hospitality did not include a share of their\r\nbread and cheese but they gave me a drink of their beer.  The tunnel is\r\ntwo miles long, and was drippingly wet.  Several hours passed before we\r\nemerged, not into sunshine but into the open, under a clouded sky and\r\nheavy rain which had succeeded a bright forenoon.  I was nearly five\r\nmiles from my uncle's house, lightly clad, hungry and tired.  To my\r\nfriends ever since I have not failed to recommend the passage of the\r\nButterley tunnel as a desirable pleasure excursion.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to work my health was greatly improved and a small\r\nadvancement in my position in the office made the rest of my time at\r\nDerby more agreeable, though, to tell the truth, I often jibbed at the\r\ndrudgery of the desk and the monotony of writing pencilled-out letters\r\nwhich was now my daily task.  Set tasks, dull routine, monotonous duty I\r\never hated.\r\n\r\nAbout this time shorthand was introduced into the railway.  A public\r\nteacher of Pitman's phonography had established himself in Derby, and the\r\nMidland engaged him to conduct classes for the junior clerks.  It was not\r\ncompulsory to attend the classes, but inducements to do so were held out.\r\nA special increase of salary was promised to those who attained a certain\r\nproficiency, and a further reward was offered; the two clerks who earned\r\nmost marks and, in the teacher's opinion, reached the highest\r\nproficiency, were to be appointed assistants to the teacher and paid\r\neight shillings weekly during future shorthand sessions, in addition to\r\nthe special increase of salary.  It was a great prize and keen was the\r\ncontest.  I had the good fortune to be one of the two; and the praise I\r\ngot, and the benefit of the money made me contented for a time.  My\r\ncompanion in this success, I am glad to know, is to-day alive and well,\r\nand like myself, a superannuated member of society.  In his day he was a\r\nnotable athlete, at one time bicycling champion of the Midland counties;\r\nand his prowess was won on the obsolete velocipede, with its one great\r\nwheel in front and a very small wheel behind.\r\n\r\nA shorthand writer, my work was now to take down letters from dictation,\r\na remove only for the better from the old way of writing from pencilled\r\ndrafts.\r\n\r\nNow it was that I made my first sincere and lasting friendship, a\r\nfriendship true and deep, but which was destined to last for only ten\r\nshort years.  Tom was never robust and Death's cold hand closed all too\r\nsoon a loveable and useful life.  Our friendship was close and intimate,\r\nsuch as is formed in the warmth of youth and which the grave alone\r\ndissolves.  To me, during those short years, it lent brightness and\r\ngaiety to existence; and, in the days that have followed, its memory has\r\nbeen, and is now, a rich possession.\r\n\r\nWith both Tom and me it was friendship at first sight, and nothing until\r\nthe final severance came ever disturbed its course.  He came from Lincoln\r\nand joined the office I was in.  He was two years my senior and had the\r\nadvantage of several years' experience in station work which I had not.\r\nWe were much alike in our tastes and habits, yet there was enough of\r\ndifference between us to impart a relish to our friendship.  Indifferent\r\nhealth, for he was delicate too, was one of the bonds between us.  We\r\nwere both fond of reading, of quiet walks and talks, and we hated crowds.\r\nHe was a good musician, played the piano; but the guitar was the\r\nfavourite accompaniment to his voice, a clear sweet tenor, and he sang\r\nwell.  I was not so susceptible to the \"concord of sweet sounds\" as he\r\nwas, but could draw a little, paint a little, string rhymes together; and\r\nso we never failed to amuse and interest each other.  He was impulsive,\r\nclever, quick of temper, ingenuous, and indignant at any want of truth or\r\ncandour in others; generous to a fault and tender hearted as a woman.  I\r\nwas more patient than he, slower in wrath, yet we sometimes quarrelled\r\nover trifles but, like lovers, were quickly reconciled; and after these\r\nlittle explosions always better friends than ever.\r\n\r\nAt Derby, for three years or so, we were inseparable.  What walks we had,\r\nwhat talks, \"what larks, Pip!\"  Dickens we adored.  How we talked of him\r\nand his books!  How we longed to hear him read, but his public readings\r\nhad ended, his voice for ever become mute and a nation mourned the loss\r\nof one who had moved it to laughter and to tears.  Tom had a wonderful\r\nmemory.  He would recite page after page from _Pickwick, David\r\nCopperfield, Barnaby Rudge_ or _Great Expectations_, as well as from\r\n_Shakespeare_ and our favourite poets.  He was fond of the pathetic, but\r\nthe humorous moved him most, and his lively gifts were welcome wherever\r\nwe went.\r\n\r\nOur favourite walk on Saturday afternoons was to the pleasant village of\r\nKedleston, some five miles from Derby, and to its fine old inn, which to\r\nus was not simply the _Kedleston Inn_ and nothing more but Dickens'\r\n_Maypole_ and nothing less.  We revelled in its resemblance, or its\r\nfancied resemblance to the famous old hostelry kept by old John Willet.\r\nSomething in the building itself, though I cannot say that, like the\r\n_Maypole_, it had \"more gable ends than a lazy man would like to count on\r\na sunny day,\" and something in its situation, and something in the\r\ncronies who gathered in its comfortable bar, and something in the bar\r\nitself combined to form the pleasant illusion in which we indulged.  The\r\nbar, like the _Maypole_ bar, was snug and cosy and complete.  Its rustic\r\nvisitors were not so solemn and slow of speech as old John Willet and Mr.\r\nCobb and long Phil Parkes and Solomon Daisy, \"who would pass two mortal\r\nhours and a half without any of them speaking a single word, and who were\r\nfirmly convinced that they were very jovial companions;\" but they were as\r\nreticent and stolid and good natured as such simple country gaffers are\r\nwont to be.\r\n\r\nI remember in particular one Saturday afternoon in late October.  It was\r\nalmost the last walk I had with Tom in Derby.  The day was perfect; as\r\nclear and bright, as mellow and crisp, as rich in colour, as only an\r\nOctober day in England can be.  We reached the _Maypole_ between five and\r\nsix o'clock.  No young Joe Willet or gipsy Hugh was there to welcome us,\r\nbut we were soon by our two selves in a homely little room, beside a\r\ncheerful fire, at a table spread with tea and ham and eggs and buttered\r\ntoast and cakes--our weekly treat.\r\n\r\nWhen this delightful meal was over, a stroll as far as the church and the\r\nstately Hall of the Curzons, back to the inn, an hour or so in the snug\r\nbar with the village worthies, who welcomed our almost weekly visits and\r\nthe yarns we brought from Derby town; then back home by the broad\r\nhighway, under the star-lit sky--an afternoon and an evening to be ever\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nThe _Kedleston Inn_, I am told, no longer exists; no longer greets the\r\neye of the wayfarer, no longer welcomes him to its pleasant bar.  Now it\r\nis a farmhouse.  No youthful enthusiast can now be beguiled into calling\r\nit _The Maypole_; and, indeed, in these unromantic days, though it had\r\nremained unchanged, there would be little danger of this I think.\r\n\r\nSoon after this memorable day Tom left the service of the Midland for a\r\nmore lucrative situation with a mercantile firm in Glasgow, and I was\r\nleft widowed and alone.  For six months or more we had been living\r\ntogether in the country, some four miles from Derby, in the house of the\r\nvillage blacksmith.  It was a pretty house, stood a little apart from the\r\nforge, and was called Rock Villa.  I wonder if the present Engineer-in-\r\nChief of the Midland Railway recollects a little incident connected with\r\nit.  He (now Chief Engineer then a well grown youth of eighteen or\r\nnineteen) was younger than I, and was preparing for the engineering\r\nprofession in which he has succeeded so well.  He lived with his parents\r\nvery near to Rock Villa, and one day, for some reason or other, we said\r\nwe would each of us make a sketch of Rock Villa, afterwards compare them,\r\nand let his sister decide which was the better, so we set to work and did\r\nour best.  In the matter of correct drawing his, I am sure, far surpassed\r\nmine, but the young lady decided in my favour, perhaps because my\r\nproduction looked more picturesque and romantic than his!\r\n\r\nWhen Tom had gone I became dissatisfied with my work, and a\r\ndisappointment which I suffered at being passed over in some office\r\npromotions increased that dissatisfaction.  I was an expert shorthand\r\nwriter and this seemed to be the only reason for keeping me back from\r\nbetter work, so at least I thought, and I think so still.  My sense of\r\ninjustice was touched; and I determined I would, like Tom, if the\r\nopportunity served, seek my fortune elsewhere.  The chance I longed for\r\ncame.  I paid a short visit to Tom, and whilst in Glasgow, obtained the\r\npost of private clerk to the Stores Superintendent of the Caledonian\r\nRailway, and on the last day of the year 1872, I left the Midland\r\nRailway, to the service of which I had been as it were born, in which my\r\nfather and uncles and cousins served, against the wish of my father, and\r\nto the surprise of my relatives.  But I had reached man's estate, and\r\nfelt a pride in going my own way, and in seeking, unassisted, my fortune,\r\nwhatever it might be.\r\n\r\nWhat had I learned in my first five years of railway work?  Not very\r\nmuch; the next few years were to be far more fruitful; but I had acquired\r\nsome business habits; a practical acquaintance with shorthand, which was\r\nyet to stand me in good stead; some knowledge of rates and fares, their\r\nnature and composition, which was also to be useful to me in after life;\r\nsome familiarity with the compilation of time-tables and the working of\r\ntrains; but of practical knowledge of work at stations I was quite\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\nThus equipped, without the parental blessing, with little money in my\r\npurse, with health somewhat improved but still delicate, I bade good-bye\r\nto Derby, light-hearted enough, and hopeful enough, and journeyed north\r\nto join my friend Tom, and to make my way as best I could in the\r\ncommercial capital of \"bonnie Scotland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nRAILWAY PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon any description of the new life that awaited me in\r\nGlasgow, I will briefly allude to the principal events connected with the\r\nMidland and with railways generally which took place during the first\r\nfive years of my railway career.\r\n\r\nClosely associated with many of these events was Mr. James Allport, the\r\nMidland general manager, one of the foremost and ablest of the early\r\nrailway pioneers, regarding whom it is fit and proper a few words should\r\nbe said.  Strangely enough I never saw him until nearly two years after I\r\nentered the Midland service, and this was on the occasion of a visit of\r\nthe Prince and Princess of Wales to Derby.  We clerks were allowed good\r\npositions on the station platform to witness the arrival of their Royal\r\nHighnesses by their special train from London.  Mr. Allport accompanied\r\nthem along the platform to the carriages outside the station.  Probably\r\nthe chairman and directors of the company were also present, but our eyes\r\nwere not for them.  Directors were to us junior clerks, remote\r\npersonalities, mythical beings dwelling on Olympian heights.\r\n\r\n[Sir James Allport: allport.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt was a great thing to see the future King and Queen of England, and our\r\nloyalty and enthusiasm knew no bounds.  They were young and charming, and\r\nbeloved by the people; but, hero worshipper as I was, our great general\r\nmanager was to me even more than royalty.  I little thought, as I looked\r\non Mr. Allport then, that, twenty years later, I should appear before him\r\nto give evidence concerning Irish railways, when he was chairman of an\r\nimportant Royal Commission.\r\n\r\nThe great abilities which enable a man to win and hold such a position as\r\nhis fired my fancy.  I look at men and men's affairs with different eyes\r\nnow; but Mr. Allport was a great personality, and youthful enthusiasm\r\nmight well be excused for placing him on a high pedestal.  He was tall\r\nand handsome, with well-shaped head, broad brow, large clear keen eyes,\r\nfirm well-formed mouth, strong nose and chin, possessed of an abundant\r\nhead of hair, not close cropped in the style of to-day, but full and\r\nwavy, and what one never sees now, a handsome natural curl along the\r\ncentre of the head with a parting on each side.  This suited him well,\r\nand added to his distinctive individuality.  When I entered the Midland\r\nservice he was fifty-six years of age and in the plenitude of his power,\r\nfor those were days when the company was forcing its way north and south\r\nand widely extending its territory.  He was the animating spirit of all\r\nthe company's enterprises.  No opposition, no difficulties ever daunted\r\nhim.  His nature was bold and fitted to command, and to him is due, in a\r\nlarge degree, the proud position the Midland holds to-day.  It was not\r\nuntil late in life, 1884 I think, when he had reached the age of seventy-\r\ntwo, that his great qualities were accorded public recognition.  He then\r\nreceived the honour of knighthood but had retired from active service and\r\nbecome a director of his company.\r\n\r\nThere was another personality that loomed large, in those years, on the\r\nMidland--Samuel Swarbrick, the accountant.  His world was finance, and in\r\nit he was a master.  So great was his skill that the Great Eastern\r\nRailway Company, which, financially, was in a parlous condition and their\r\ndividend _nil_, in 1866 took him from the Midland and made him their\r\ngeneral manager, at, in those days, a princely salary.  Their confidence\r\nwas fully justified; his skill brought the company, if not to absolute\r\nprosperity, at least to a dividend-paying condition, and laid the\r\nfoundation of the position that company now occupies.\r\n\r\nHis reputation as a man of figures stood as I have just said very high,\r\nbut, whilst I was at Derby, and before he moved to the Great Eastern, he\r\nwas prominent also as the happy possessor of the best coloured meerschaum\r\npipes in the county, and this, in those days, was no small distinction.\r\nBut a man does not achieve greatness by his own unaided efforts.  Others,\r\nhis subordinates, help him to climb the ladder.  It was so with Mr.\r\nSwarbrick.  There was a tall policeman in the service of the company, the\r\npossessor of a fine figure, and a splendid long sandy-coloured beard.  His\r\nprimary duty was to air himself at the front entrance of the station\r\narrayed in a fine uniform and tall silk hat, and this duty he\r\nconscientiously performed.  Secondarily, his occupation was to start the\r\ncolouring of new meerschaums for Mr. Swarbrick.  Non-meerschaum smokers\r\nmay not know what a delicate task this is, but once well begun the rest\r\nis comparatively easy.  The tall policeman was an artist at the work; but\r\nit nearly brought him to a tragic end, as I will relate.\r\n\r\nOutside Derby station was a ticket platform at which all incoming trains\r\nstopped for the collection of tickets.  This platform was on a bridge\r\nthat crossed the river.  One Saturday night our fine policeman was airing\r\nhimself on this platform, colouring a handsome new meerschaum for Mr.\r\nSwarbrick.  It was a windy night and a sudden gust blew his tall hat into\r\nthe river, and after it unfortunately dropped the meerschaum.  Hat and\r\npipe both!  Without a moment's hesitation in plunged the policeman to the\r\nrescue; but the river was deep and he an indifferent swimmer.  The night\r\nwas dark and he was not brought to land till life had nearly left him.  He\r\nrecovered, but lost his sight and became blind for the rest of his life.\r\nMr. Swarbrick provided for him, I believe, by setting him up in a small\r\npublic house, where, I am told, despite his loss of sight, he ended his\r\ndays not unhappily.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, compared with 1851, the Midland had made giant strides.  It\r\nworked a thousand miles of railway against five hundred; its capital had\r\ndoubled and reached thirty-two millions, about one-fourth of what it is\r\nto-day; its revenue had risen from about a million to over a million and\r\na half; and the dividend was five and a half compared with two and five-\r\neighths per cent.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Midland route to Saint Pancras; the projection of the\r\nSettle and Carlisle line; the introduction of Pullman cars, parlour\r\nsaloons, sleeping and dining cars; the adoption of gas and electricity\r\nfor the lighting of carriages; the running of third-class carriages by\r\nall trains; the abolition of second-class and reduction of first-class\r\nfares; and the establishment of superannuation funds were amongst the\r\nmost striking events in the railway world during this period.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of October, 1868, the first passenger train ran into\r\nSaint Pancras station, and the Midland competition for London traffic now\r\nbegan in earnest, and from that time onward helped to develop those\r\nmagnificent rival passenger train services between the Metropolis and\r\nEngland's busy centres and between England and Scotland and Ireland,\r\nwhich, for luxury, speed and comfort, stand pre-eminent.  Prior to this,\r\nthe Midland access to London had been by the exercise of running powers\r\nover the Great Northern Railway from Hitchin to King's Cross.  The Great\r\nNorthern, reluctant to lose the Midland, and fearing their rivalry, had,\r\na few years previously, offered them running powers in perpetuity.  \"No,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Allport, \"it is impossible that you can reconcile the interests\r\nof these two great companies on the same railway; we are always only\r\n_second-best_.\"  Second-best certainly never suited the ambitious policy\r\nof the Midland, and so the offer was rejected, and their line to London\r\nmade.  It was at that time thought that the Midland headquarters would be\r\nremoved from Derby to London, and I remember how excited the clerical\r\nstaff and their wives and sweethearts were at the prospect.  The idea was\r\nseriously considered but, for various reasons, abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe Settle and Carlisle line, perhaps the greatest achievement of the\r\nMidland, was not completed until sometime after I left their service.  It\r\nwas opened in the year 1875.  In 1866 they obtained the Act for its\r\nconstruction.  For some years their eyes had been as eagerly turned\r\ntowards Scotland as the eyes of Scotchmen had ever been towards England,\r\nand for the same reason--the hope of gain.  The Midland had hitherto been\r\nexcluded from any proper share of the Scotch traffic, but now having\r\nsecured the right to extend their system to Carlisle, they hoped to join\r\nforces with their allies, the Glasgow and South-Western, and secure a\r\nfair share of it.  But \"there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip,\"\r\nand in 1869 in a fit of timidity--a weakness most unusual with them--they\r\nnearly lost this valuable right.  The year 1867 was a time of great\r\nfinancial anxiety; the Midland was weighted with heavy expenditure on\r\ntheir London extension, the necessity for further capital became clamant,\r\nthe shareholders were seized with alarm, and a shareholders' consultative\r\ncommittee was appointed, with the result that, in 1869, the company,\r\nbadgered and worried beyond endurance, actually applied to Parliament for\r\npower to abandon the Settle and Carlisle line, and for authority to enter\r\ninto an agreement with the London and North-Western for access over that\r\ncompany's railway to Carlisle.  That power and authority, however,\r\nParliament, _in its wisdom_, refused to give.\r\n\r\nThe financial clouds, as all clouds do, after a time dispersed; the\r\noutlook grew brighter, the Midland made the line, and it was opened, as I\r\nhave said, throughout to Carlisle in 1875.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1872 Mr. Allport visited the United States and was\r\ngreatly impressed with the Pullman cars.  On his return he introduced\r\nthem on the Midland, both the parlour car and the sleeper.  About the\r\nsame time the London and North-Western also commenced the running of\r\nsleeping cars to Scotland and to Holyhead.  To which company belongs the\r\ncredit of being first in the field with this most desirable additional\r\naccommodation for the comfort of passengers I am not prepared to say;\r\nperhaps honors were easy.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest innovation of the time were the running by the Midland\r\nof third-class carriages by all trains; and the abolition of second-class\r\ncarriages and fares, accompanied by a reduction of the first-class fares.\r\nThe first event took place in 1872, but the latter not till 1875.  The\r\nfirst was a democratic step indeed, and aroused great excitement.\r\nWilliams, in his book _The Midland Railway_, wrote, \"On the last day of\r\nMarch, 1872, we remarked to a friend: 'To-morrow morning the Midland will\r\nbe the most popular railway in England.'  Nor did we incur much risk by\r\nour prediction.  For on that day the Board had decided that on and after\r\nthe first of April, they would run third-class carriages by all trains;\r\nthe wires had flashed the tidings to the newspapers, the bills were in\r\nthe hands of the printers, and on the following morning the Directors\r\nwoke to find themselves famous.\"  At a later period, Mr. Allport said, if\r\nthere was one part of his public life on which he looked back with more\r\nsatisfaction than another it was the time when this boon was conferred on\r\nthird-class passengers.\r\n\r\nWhen we contemplate present conditions of third-class travel it is hard\r\nto realise what they were before this change took place; slow speed,\r\ndelays and discomfort; bare boards; hard seats; shunting of third-class\r\ntrains into sidings and waiting there for other trains, sometimes even\r\ngoods trains, to pass.  Mr. Allport might well be proud of the part he\r\nplayed.\r\n\r\nAnother matter which concerned, not so much the public as the welfare of\r\nthe clerical staff of the railways, was the establishment of\r\nSuperannuation Funds; yet the public was interested too, for the\r\ninterests of the railway service and the general community are closely\r\ninterwoven.  Up till now station masters and clerks had struggled on\r\nwithout prospect of any provision for their old age.  Their pay was\r\nbarely sufficient to enable them to maintain a respectable position in\r\nlife and afforded no margin for providing for the future.\r\n\r\nAt last, the principal railway companies, with the consent of their\r\nshareholders, and with Parliamentary sanction, established Superannuation\r\nFunds, which ever since have brought comfort and security to their\r\nofficers and clerical staff, and have proved of benefit to the companies\r\nthemselves.  A pension encourages earlier retirement from work, quickens\r\npromotion, and vitalises the whole service.  On nearly all railways\r\nretirement is optional at sixty and compulsory at sixty-five.\r\n\r\nThe London and North-Western was the first company to adopt the system of\r\nsuperannuation, the London and South-Western second, the Great Western\r\ncame third, the Midland fourth, and other companies followed in their\r\nwake.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the Railway Clearing House obtained Parliamentary power to form a\r\nfund for its staff, with permission to railway companies not large enough\r\nto successfully run funds of their own, and also to the Irish Railway\r\nClearing House, to become partners in this fund.  The Irish Clearing\r\nHouse took advantage of this, as also have many railway companies, and\r\npractically the whole of the clerical service throughout the United\r\nKingdom can to-day look forward to the benefits of superannuation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nSCOTLAND, GLASGOW LIFE, AND THE CALEDONIAN LINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the last day of December, in the year 1872, between seven and eight\r\no'clock in the evening, I arrived at Glasgow by the Caledonian train from\r\nCarlisle, and was met at Buchanan Street Station by my good friend Tom.\r\n\r\nAfter supper we repaired to the streets to see the crowds that congregate\r\non _Hogmanhay_, to make acquaintance with the mysteries of\r\n\"first-footin',\" and to join in ushering in the \"guid new year.\"  It was\r\na stirring time, for Scotchmen encounter their _Hogmanhay_ with ardent\r\n_spirits_.  They are as keen in their pleasures as in their work.  Compare\r\nfor instance their country dances with ours.  As Keats, in his letters\r\nfrom Scotland says, \"it is about the same as leisurely stirring a cup o'\r\ntea and beating up a batter pudding.\"  The public houses and bars were\r\ndriving a lively trade, but \"Forbes Mackenzie\" was in force, and come\r\neleven o'clock, though it were a hundred _Hogmanhays_, they all had to\r\nclose.  We met some new-made friends of Tom's and joined in their\r\nconviviality.  I was the dark complexioned man of the party, and as a\r\n\"first-footer\" in great request.  We did not go home till morning, and\r\nreached there a little hilarious ourselves, but it was our first\r\n_Hogmanhay_ and may be forgiven.\r\n\r\nDear reader, did you ever lie in a _concealed bed_?  It is a Scottish\r\ndevice cunningly contrived to murder sleep.  At least so Tom and I found\r\nit.  It was my fate to sleep, to lie I should say, in one for several\r\nweeks.  Its purpose is to economise space, and like Goldsmith's chest of\r\ndrawers, it is \"contrived a double debt to pay,\" a sleeping room by\r\nnight, a sitting room by day.\r\n\r\nWhilst Glasgow is a city of _flats_ its people are resourceful and\r\nenergetic.  Keen and canny, they drive a close bargain but, scrupulous\r\nand conscientious, fulfil it faithfully.  Proud of their city and its\r\nprogress, its industries and manufactures, its civic importance, they are\r\na little disdainful perhaps, perhaps a little jealous, of their beautiful\r\nelder sister, Edinburgh.  Glasgow is the Belfast of Scotland!\r\n\r\nSelf-contained houses are the exception and are limited to the well-to-\r\ndo.  The flat, in most cases, means a restricted number of apartments,\r\ninsufficient bedroom accommodation, and the _concealed bed_ is Glasgow's\r\nway of solving the difficulty.\r\n\r\nTom and I did not take kindly to our hole in the wall, and soon found\r\nother lodgings where space was not so circumscribed, and where we could\r\nsleep in an open bed in an open room.\r\n\r\nOur new quarters were a great success; a ground-floor flat with a fine\r\nfront door; a large well-furnished sitting room with two windows looking\r\nout on to the street, and an equally large double-bedded room at the back\r\nof the sitting room.  Our landlady, a kind, motherly, canny Scotchwoman,\r\nlooked after us well and favoured us with many a bit of good advice: \"You\r\nmust be guid laddies, and tak care o' the bawbees; you maun na eat\r\nbutchers' meat twice the week; tak plenty o' parritch and dinna be\r\nextravagant.\"  Economy with the good old soul was a cardinal virtue,\r\nwaste a deadly sin.  I fear she was often shocked at our easy Saxon ways,\r\nthough Tom and I thought ourselves models of thrift.\r\n\r\nOnce, it was on a Sunday, Tom and I, with a party of friends, had had a\r\nvery long walk, a regular pedestrian excursion, thirty miles, there or\r\nthereabouts, to use a Scotticism, and poor Tom was quite knocked up and\r\nconfined to bed for several days.  Our good old landlady was greatly\r\nshocked; a strict Sabbatarian, she knew it was a punishment for \"breakin'\r\nthe Sabbath; why had na ye gane to the kirk like guid laddies?\"  We\r\nmodestly reminded her that we always did go, excepting of course on this\r\nparticular Sunday.  \"Then whit business had ye to stay awa on ony\r\nSabbath?\"  We had nothing to say in answer to this.  The dear old\r\ncreature was really shocked at our backsliding; but she nursed Tom very\r\ntenderly all the same.\r\n\r\nWhen the sultry heat of summer came we found Glasgow very trying, and\r\nthough sorry to leave our good landlady, moved into the country, to\r\nCambuslang, a village some four miles from the city, which was then\r\nbecoming a favourite residential resort.\r\n\r\nAt Cambuslang I made the acquaintance and became the friend of _Cynicus_,\r\nthe humorous artist whose satirical sketches have, for many years, been\r\nwell-known and well sold in England, in Scotland and in Ireland too.  He\r\nwas then a youth of about twenty.  Longing to see the world and without\r\nthe necessary means, he emulated Goldsmith, made a prolonged tour in\r\nFrance and Italy supporting himself not by his flute nor by disputations,\r\nbut by his brush and palette.  For a few weeks at a time he worked in\r\ntowns or cities, sold what he painted, and then, with purse replenished,\r\nwandered on.  He and I were living \"doon the watter,\" at Dunoon, on the\r\nClyde, one summer month.  A Fancy Dress Bazaar was on at the time.  The\r\nfirst evening we went to it, and he, unobserved, made furtive sketches of\r\nthe most prominent people and the prettiest girls.  We both sat up all\r\nthat night, he working at and finishing the sketches.  Next morning by\r\nthe first boat and first train, we took them to Glasgow, had six hundred\r\nlithographic copies struck off; back post-haste to Dunoon; in the evening\r\nto the Bazaar, and sold the copies at threepence each.  It was an immense\r\nsuccess; we could have disposed of twice the number; every pretty girl's\r\nadmirer wanted a copy of her picture, and the portraits of the presiding\r\n\"meenister\" and of the good-looking unmarried curate were eagerly\r\npurchased by fond mammas and adoring daughters.  We had our fun, and\r\ncleared besides a profit of nearly four pounds sterling.  This financial\r\n_coup_ would not have come off so well but for the warm-hearted\r\nco-operation of our railway printers, McCorquodale and Coy.  They, good\r\npeople, entered into our exploit with a will, did their part well, and\r\nmade little if any profit, generously leaving that to _Cynicus_ and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nTo his mother, like many another clever son, _Cynicus_ owed his talent.\r\nShe was a woman of great intellectual endowment, with highly cultivated\r\nliterary tastes.  Her memory was remarkable and her conversational powers\r\nvery great.  She read much and thought deeply.  In a modest way her\r\nparlour, which attracted many young people of literary and artistic\r\nleanings, recalled the _Salons_ of France of a century ago.  She\r\nentertained charmingly with tea and cakes and delightful talk.  Of\r\nstrong, firm, decided character, she might, perhaps, have been thought a\r\nlittle deficient in womanly gentleness had not genuine kindness of heart,\r\nmotherly feeling, and a happy humour lent a softness to her features and\r\nimparted to them a particular charm.  She exercised an authority over her\r\nhousehold which inspired respect and contrasted strikingly with the easy-\r\ngoing parental ways of to-day.  There were other sons and there were\r\ndaughters also, all more or less gifted, but _Cynicus_ was the genius of\r\nthe family--its bright particular star.\r\n\r\nThe various lodgings of my bachelor days was never quite of the\r\nconventional sort.  The Cambuslang quarters certainly were not.  The\r\nhouse was large and old-fashioned.  Originally it had been two smallish\r\nhouses: the two front doors still remained side by side, but only one was\r\nused.  The rooms on the ground floor were small, the original building\r\ncomposed of one storey only, but another had been added of quite spacious\r\ndimensions.  We had two excellent, large well-furnished rooms upstairs.\r\nThe landlady was an interesting character and so was her husband.  She\r\nwas Irish, he Scotch; she about seventy years of age, he under fifty; she\r\nruddy, healthy, hearty, good-looking; he, pale, nervous, shy, retiring.\r\nBut on the last Thursday of each month he was quite another man.  On that\r\nday he went to Glasgow to collect the rents of some small houses he\r\nowned; and generally came home rather \"fou\" and hilarious, when the old\r\nlady would take him in hand, and put him to bed.\r\n\r\nThey had an only child, a son, a grown up man, an uncouth ill-looking\r\nungainly fellow, who did no work, smoked and loafed about, but was the\r\nidol of his mother.  He resembled neither parent in the least, and,\r\nexcept that such vagaries of nature are not unknown, it might have been\r\nsupposed that some cuckoo had visited the parental nest.\r\n\r\nA gaunt, hard-featured domestic completed this interesting family, and\r\nshe was uncommon too.  By no means young, what Balzac calls \"a woman of\r\ncanonical age,\" she resembled Pere Grandet's tall Nanon.  Like Nanon, she\r\nhad been the devoted servant of the family for nearly a quarter of a\r\ncentury, and like her, had no interest outside that of her master and\r\nmistress.  She was always working, rarely went out, spoke little, but\r\nministered to the wants of Tom and myself, and waited on us with\r\nunremitting attention.\r\n\r\nDespite all drawbacks, however, they were fine lodgings.  The old lady\r\nwas a wonderful cook and had all the liberality of her race.\r\n\r\nNew Year's Day, the great Scotch holiday, Tom and I spent in Edinburgh,\r\nand returned much impressed with its stately beauty.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I entered upon my work at St. Rollox, where the stores\r\ndepartment of the Caledonian Railway is situated.  The head of the\r\ndepartment was styled Stores Superintendent.  I thought him the most\r\nimpressive looking man I had ever seen.  He overpowered me; in his\r\npresence I never felt at ease.  He was a big man, and looked bigger than\r\nhe was; good-looking too; ruddy, portly, well-dressed and formal.  An\r\nembodiment of commercial energy and dignity.  In his face gravity,\r\nkeenness, and good health were blended.  Soon after I joined his staff he\r\nleft the Caledonian to become General Manager of Young's Paraffin Oil\r\nCompany, and subsequently its Managing Director.  Success, I believe,\r\nalways attended him.  No position could lose any of its importance in his\r\nhands.  When he left St. Rollox a great blank was felt; he filled so\r\nlarge a space.  He has lately gone to his rest full of years and honors.\r\n\r\nI fear he never liked me, nor had any great opinion of my abilities.  This\r\nwas not to be wondered at, for I am sure I did not display any excessive\r\nzeal for the work on which I was then employed, and which I found\r\nmonotonous and uninteresting.\r\n\r\nHe confided to his chief clerk, who was my friend, that one day he had\r\nseen me, in business hours, in the city, smoking a cigarette and looking\r\nat the girls, and was sure I would never do much good.  He had very\r\nstrict business notions.  I confessed to the cigarette, but not to the\r\ngraver charge.  It was a wholesome tonic, however, and pulled me up.  I\r\nwanted to get on in life; ambition was stirring within me; and I formed\r\nsome good resolutions which, as time went on, I kept more or less\r\nfaithfully.\r\n\r\nAt St. Rollox one's daily lunch was a matter of some difficulty.  It was\r\na district of factories, and the only restaurants were the Great Western\r\nCooking Depots, where one could get a steak and bread and cheese for\r\nfivepence, but the rooms and tables and accessories were, to say the\r\nleast, unappetising.  Hunger had to be satisfied, however, and I had to\r\nswallow my pride and my five-pennyworth.  I varied this occasionally by\r\nbringing with me my own sandwiches and eating them seated on a tombstone\r\nin Sighthill cemetery, which was less than a quarter of a mile distant\r\nfrom the stores department.\r\n\r\nMy work, as I have said, was monotonous enough: writing letters from\r\ndictation, an occupation which gave but little exercise to one's\r\nfaculties.  I obtained some variation by occasionally taking a turn\r\nthrough the various stores and getting into touch with the practical men\r\nin charge.  They were always very civil and ready to talk of their\r\nbusiness, and so I learned something of the nature, quality, uses and\r\ncost of many things necessary to the working of a railway, which I\r\nafterwards found very useful.  Occasionally also I visited the\r\nlaboratory, in which an analytical chemist was regularly engaged.\r\n\r\nThe event which, in my short service of two years with the Caledonian,\r\nseemed to me of the greatest moment, was that, after six months or so, I\r\nbecame a taxpayer!  This was an event indeed.  In the offices at Derby it\r\nwas only, as a rule, middle-aged or old men who attained this proud\r\ndistinction; and here was I, not yet twenty-two, with my salary raised to\r\n100 pounds a year, paying income tax at the rate of _threepence_ in the\r\npound on forty pounds, for an abatement of sixty pounds was allowed.\r\nUntil I got used to the novelty I was as proud as Lucifer.\r\n\r\nThe office in which I now worked had no Apollos, no literary geniuses, no\r\nLong Jacks, no boy benedicts, such as adorned our desks at Derby, but it\r\nrejoiced in one _rara avis_, who came a few months after and left a few\r\nmonths before me.  He was a middle-aged, aristocratic, kind,\r\ngood-hearted, unbusinesslike man, and was brother to a baronet.  He\r\nprofessed a knowledge of medicine and brought a bottle, a bolus or a\r\nplaster, whichever he deemed best, whenever any of us complained of cold\r\nor cough, of headache or backache or any ailment whatever.  When he left\r\nwe all received from him a parting gift.  Mine was a handsome, expensive,\r\nred-felt chest protector.  I wore it constantly for a year or two and,\r\nfor aught I know, it may be that by its protecting influence against the\r\nrigour of Glasgow winters, the bituminous atmosphere of St. Rollox and\r\nthe smoke-charged fogs of the city, I am alive and well to-day.  Who can\r\ntell?  It is certain that I then had a bad cough nearly always; and this\r\nI am sure was what decided the form of his parting gift to me.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that I attended my first public dinner and made my\r\nfirst speech in public.  Several days before the event I was told that,\r\nbeing in the Volunteer Force, I had been placed on the toast list to\r\nreply for the Army, Navy and Volunteers.  It was a railway dinner, for\r\nthe purpose of celebrating the departure to England, on promotion, of the\r\nchief clerk in the Midland Railway Company's Scottish Agency Office.  The\r\ndinner was largely attended.  The idea of having to speak filled me with\r\ntrepidation.  But to my great surprise I acquitted myself with credit.\r\nOnce on my legs I found that nervousness left me, words came freely and I\r\neven enjoyed the novel experience.  To suddenly discover oneself\r\nproficient where failure had been feared increases self esteem and adds\r\nto the sum of happiness.  At this dinner I also made my first\r\nacquaintance with that \"Great chieftain o' the puddin' race,\" the\r\n_Haggis_, which deserves the pre-eminence it enjoys.\r\n\r\nOne night, towards the end of December, in 1874, when skating by\r\nmoonlight, not far from Cambuslang, I chanced to meet a young friend, a\r\nclerk in the Glasgow and South-Western Railway, who, like myself, was\r\nenjoying the pleasures of the ice.  Tom was not with me, for he, poor\r\nfellow! was not well enough to be out o' nights in winter.  My young\r\nfriend gave me, with great eagerness, a rare piece of news.  Mr.\r\nJohnstone, the Glasgow and South-Western general manager, was retiring\r\nand Mr. Wainwright was to succeed him!  Well, that did not excite me, and\r\nI wondered at his earnestness; but more was to follow.  Mr. Wainwright,\r\nas general manager, required a principal clerk and there was, it seemed,\r\nno one in the place quite suitable.  He must be good at correspondence,\r\nand expert at shorthand.  I was, my young friend said, the very man; I\r\nmust apply.  Mr. Wainwright was English, so was I; I came from the\r\nMidland, and the Midland and the Glasgow and South-Western were hand and\r\nglove.  How lucky we had met; he had not thought of me till this very\r\nmoment.  It was fate.  Would I write tonight?  By this time I was as\r\neager as himself.  No more skating for me that night.  I hurried home,\r\nTom and I composed a careful and judicious letter.  I posted it in Her\r\nMajesty's pillar box hard by; went to bed, but was too excited to sleep.\r\nAn answer soon came, and an interview with Mr. Wainwright followed.  I\r\nreceived the appointment, at a salary of 120 pounds a year to begin with;\r\nand in the early days of the new year, two years after my first\r\nappearance in Scotland, entered upon my duties, not at Saint Enoch\r\nStation, where the headquarters of the Glasgow and South-Western now are,\r\nbut at Bridge Street Station on the south side of the river, where the\r\noffice staff of the company was then accommodated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nGENERAL RAILWAY ACTS OF PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch unromantic literature as Acts of Parliament had not, it may be\r\nsupposed, up to this, formed part of my mental pabulum.  I knew that an\r\nAct was a necessary preliminary to the construction of a railway, and\r\nthis was all I knew concerning the relations between the railways and the\r\nState.  Whilst a little learning may be a dangerous thing, in my new\r\nsituation, I soon discovered that a general manager's clerk would be the\r\nbetter of possessing some knowledge of the numerous Acts of Parliament\r\nthat affected railway companies.  Almost daily questions arose in which\r\nsuch knowledge was useful; so I determined to become acquainted with\r\nthem, and in my leisure hours made as profound a study as I could of that\r\ncompilation which, in railway offices was then in general use--_Bigg's\r\nGeneral Railway Acts_.  I found the formidable looking volume more\r\nreadable than I had imagined and less difficult to understand than I had\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nGovernments have ever kept a watchful eye on railway companies.  Up to\r\n1875, the year at which we have now arrived, no less than 112 general\r\nActs of Parliament affecting railways had been placed on the Statute Book\r\nof the realm.  They were applicable to all railways alike, and in\r\naddition to and independent of the special Acts which each company must\r\nobtain for itself, first for its incorporation and construction, and\r\nafterwards for extensions of its system, for the raising of capital, and\r\nfor various other purposes.\r\n\r\nMany of the general Acts have been framed upon the recommendations of\r\nvarious Select Committees and Royal and Vice-Regal Commissions, which\r\nhave been appointed from time to time since railways began.  From 1835\r\ndown to the present year of 1918 some score or more of these Committees\r\nand Commissions have gravely sat and issued their more or less wise and\r\nweighty reports.\r\n\r\nWhat are these numerous Acts of Parliament and what are their objects,\r\nscope, and intentions?\r\n\r\nWhilst neither time nor space admit of detailed exposition, not to speak\r\nof the patience of my readers, a few observations upon some of the\r\nprincipal enactments may not be inapposite or uninteresting.\r\n\r\nPride of place belongs to the _Carriers' Act_ of 1830, passed in the\r\nreign of William IV., five years after the first public railway (the\r\nStockton and Darlington) was opened.  This Act, although in it the word\r\n_railway_ does not appear, is an important Act to railway companies, and\r\npossesses the singular and uncommon merit of having been framed for the\r\n_protection_ of Common Carriers.  It is intituled \"_An Act for the more\r\neffectual Protection of Mail Contractors, Stage Coach Proprietors, and\r\nother Common Carriers for Hire, against the Loss or Injury to Parcels or\r\nPackages delivered to them for Conveyance or Custody, the Value and\r\nContents of which shall not be Declared to them by the Owners thereof_.\"\r\nThe draughtsman of this dignified little Act it is clear was greatly\r\naddicted to _capitals_.  Probably he thought they heightened effect, much\r\nas Charles Lamb spelt plum pudding with a _b_--\"plumb pudding,\" because,\r\nhe said, \"it reads fatter and more suetty.\"  At the time this Act came\r\ninto being, railways in the eye of Parliament were public highways, upon\r\nwhich you or I, if we paid the prescribed tolls, could convey our\r\ntraffic, our vehicles, or ourselves.  In the years 1838-1840 many of the\r\ncompanies obtained powers enabling them to act as public carriers; and in\r\n1840 questions having arisen in Parliament as to the rights of the public\r\nin this respect the subject was referred to a Select Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons.  The Committee's report disposed of the view which,\r\nuntil then, Parliament had held, and expressed the opinion that the right\r\nof persons to run their own engines and carriages was a dead letter for\r\nthe good reason, amongst others, that it was necessary for railway trains\r\nto be run and controlled by and under one complete undivided authority.\r\n\r\nAfter the _Carriers' Act_, which applied to all carriers as well as to\r\nrailways, the first general railway Act of importance was the _Railways\r\n(Conveyance of Mails) Act_ of 1838.  This Act enabled the\r\nPostmaster-General to require railway companies to convey mails by all\r\ntrains and to provide sorting carriages when necessary, the Royal Arms to\r\nbe painted on such carriages, and in 1844, under the _Railway Regulation\r\nAct_, it was further enacted that the Postmaster-General could require,\r\nfor the conveyance of mails, that trains should be run at any rate of\r\nspeed, _certified to be safe_, but not to exceed 27 miles an hour!\r\n\r\nAs I have said, the Select Committee of 1840 reported against the right\r\nof the public to run their own engines and carriages on railways.  They\r\nmade recommendations which led to the passing of the _Railway Regulation\r\nAct_ of that year, and in that Act powers were, for the first time,\r\nconferred upon the Board of Trade in connection with railways.  It was\r\nthe beginning of that authority, which since has greatly grown, but which\r\nthe Board of Trade have in the main exercised with an impartiality, which\r\npublic authorities do not always display.  The Act empowered the Board,\r\nbefore any new railway was opened, to require notice from the railway\r\ncompany.  This power was repealed by an Act of 1842, and larger powers\r\ngranted in its place, including the right to compel the inspection of\r\nsuch railways before being opened for traffic.  The Act of 1840 also\r\nrequired the companies, under penalty, to furnish to the Board of Trade\r\nreturns of traffic, as well as of all accidents attended with personal\r\ninjury; and to submit their bye-laws for certification.\r\n\r\nOf the _railway mania_ period I have spoken in a previous chapter.  For a\r\ntime enormous success attended some of the lines.  Amongst others the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester and the Stockton and Darlington enjoyed mouth\r\nwatering dividends; the former ten, the latter fifteen per cent.!  Said\r\nthe Government to themselves, \"'Tis time we saw to this,\" and accordingly\r\nthey passed the _Railway Regulation Act_ of 1844.  This Act provided that\r\nif at any time, after twenty-one years, the dividend of any railway\r\nshould exceed ten per cent., the Treasury might revise the rates and\r\nfares so as to reduce the profits to not more than ten per cent.  This\r\nexpectation of high dividends, I need hardly say, has not been realised,\r\nand the Act in this respect has been a dead letter.  The Act also\r\nconferred an option on the Treasury to acquire future railways at twenty-\r\nfive years purchase of the annual profits; or, if such profits were less\r\nthan ten per cent., the price was to be left to arbitration.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting now, when, owing to the war, the railways of the land\r\nare under temporary Government control, and their future all uncertain,\r\nto remember that, on the Statute Book to-day, there is an Act which\r\nprovides for State purchase of the railways of the country.  Whether a\r\nsolution of the difficulty will be found in State purchase or in State\r\ncontrol it is hard to say, but it is clear that some solution of the\r\nproblem will become imperative when the war is ended and normal\r\nconditions return.  Justice and reason demand it.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1845 three long Acts of Parliament came into force; the\r\n_Companies Clauses_, the _Lands Clauses_ and the _Railway Clauses Acts_.\r\nBetween them they contained no less than 483 sections.  Each Act was a\r\nconsolidating measure.  The first contained provisions usually inserted\r\nin Acts for the constitution of public companies, the second the same in\r\nregard to the taking of land compulsorily, and the third consolidated in\r\none general statute provisions usually introduced into Acts of Parliament\r\nauthorising the construction of railways.\r\n\r\nThe _Railway Clauses Act_ authorised railway companies to use locomotive\r\nengines, carriages and wagons; to carry passengers and goods, and to make\r\nreasonable charges not exceeding the tolls authorised by their special\r\nActs.  Since then the whole of the trade of transit by rail has been\r\nconducted by the companies owning the lines.\r\n\r\nThe gauge of railways in Great Britain was not fixed upon any scientific\r\nprinciple.  At first it followed the width of the coal tram-roads in the\r\nnorth of England, which was adopted simply on account of its practical\r\nconvenience (five feet being the usual width of the gates through which\r\nthe \"way-leaves\" led) and so four feet eight and a-half inches became the\r\nordinary gauge, but in the early days it was by no means the universal\r\ngauge.  Five feet was chosen for the Eastern Counties Railway; seven feet\r\nfor the Great Western and five feet six was used in Scotland.  The Ulster\r\nCompany in Ireland made twenty-five miles of the line from Belfast to\r\nDublin on a gauge of six feet two, while the Drogheda Company, which set\r\nout from Dublin to meet the Ulster line, adopted five feet two.  When the\r\nUlster Company complained of this, the Irish Board of Works, it is said,\r\nadmitted that it was a little awkward, but added that, as it was not\r\nlikely the intervening part would ever be made, it did not much matter.\r\nThe subject was, I believe, in Ireland referred to a General Pasley, who\r\nconsulted the authorities (who were many) throughout the kingdom.  He\r\nultimately solved the question by adding up the various gauges the\r\nauthorities favoured, and recommended the mean, which was five feet three\r\ninches; and so, for Ireland, five feet three became the standard gauge.\r\n\r\n\"The battle of the gauges,\" as it was styled at the time, was lively and\r\nspirited.  Eventually it was decided by Parliament, which in the year\r\n1846 passed the _Railway Regulation (Gauge) Act_.  This Act ordained that\r\nin Great Britain all future railways were to be constructed on a gauge of\r\nfour feet eight and a-half inches, and in Ireland of five feet three\r\ninches, excepting only certain extensions of the broad gauge Great\r\nWestern Railway.\r\n\r\nUp to this time no action at common law was maintainable against a person\r\nwho by his wrongful act, neglect or default caused the immediate death of\r\nanother person, and an Act (known as _Lord Campbell's Act_), \"for\r\ncompensating the Families of Persons Killed by Accidents,\" became law.\r\nThis enactment was due principally to the railway accidents that\r\noccurred.  They were relatively more numerous than they are now, for the\r\nmany modern appliances for ensuring safety had not then been introduced.\r\nThe Act provided that compensation would be for the benefit of wife,\r\nhusband, parent and child of the person whose death shall have been\r\ncaused.  The Act did not apply to Scotland.  Perhaps it was because the\r\nlaws of the two countries differed more then than now, and the life of\r\nthe railways in Scotland was young, England being well ahead.  Probably\r\nEngland thought she was doing enough when she legislated for herself by\r\npassing this Act.  It must be observed, however, that the Act applies to\r\nIreland as well as England.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1854 Parliament considered that _regulations_ were necessary\r\nto further control the companies and passed an important statute, the\r\n_Railway and Canal Traffic Act_.  Known, for short, in railway parlance,\r\nas \"the Act of '54,\" its main provisions dealt with:--\r\n\r\n   Reasonable facilities for receiving and forwarding traffic\r\n   The subject of undue preference, which was forbidden\r\n   Railways forming part of continuous lines to receive and forward\r\n   through traffic without obstruction\r\n   The liability of railway companies for loss of, or damage to, goods or\r\n   animals\r\n\r\nand it preserved to railway companies the _protection_ of the _Carriers'\r\nAct_, to which I have referred.\r\n\r\nThe Select Committees of 1858 and 1863 sat on the subject of the great\r\nlength of time and the immense cost which railway promotion in those days\r\nentailed, when Bills were fiercely contested, and protracted struggles\r\nbefore Parliamentary Committees took place.  Two Acts resulted from their\r\ndeliberations: the _Railway Companies' Powers Act_, 1864, and the\r\n_Railway Construction Facilities Act_ of the same year.  These Acts\r\nempowered railway companies to enter into agreements with each other in\r\nregard to maintenance, management, running over or use of each others\r\nlines or property and for joint ownership of stations.  They also enabled\r\npowers to be obtained from the Board of Trade to construct a railway\r\nwithout a special Act of Parliament, subject to the conditions that all\r\nthe landowners concerned agreed to part with the requisite land, and that\r\nno objection was raised by any other railway or canal company.  Little\r\nuse has ever been made of this well-intentioned enactment.  Landowners\r\nhave rarely been disposed to accept terms which the companies thought\r\nfair; and rival railways, in the days gone by, dearly loved a fight.\r\n\r\nBy the _Companies Clauses Consolidation Act_ of 1845 railway companies\r\nwere required to keep full and true accounts of receipts and expenditure,\r\nbut it was not until the year 1868 that Parliament placed upon the\r\ncompanies an obligation to keep their accounts in a prescribed form.  This\r\nform was scheduled to the _Regulation of Railways Act_, 1868.  It\r\nprovides for half-yearly accounts, and is the form which has been\r\nfamiliar to shareholders for many years.  This Act (1868) also ordained\r\nthat smoking compartments be provided on all trains, for all classes, on\r\nall railways, except on the railway of the Metropolitan Company.  Up to\r\nthen the railway smoker had to obtain the consent of his fellow\r\npassengers in the same compartment before he could light up, or brave\r\ntheir displeasure; and many were the altercations that ensued.  The Act\r\nalso imposed penalties on railways who provided trains for attending\r\nprize fights, which was hard on companies of sporting instincts.  A\r\nclause provided for means of communication between passengers and the\r\nservants of the company in charge of trains running twenty miles without\r\nstopping; and another clause gave the companies power to cut down trees\r\nadjoining their line which might be dangerous.  Prior to 1868, although\r\nrailways had then existed for three and forty years, the accounts of one\r\ncompany could not usefully be compared with those of another, for\r\nscarcely any two companies made up their accounts in the same way.\r\nVariety may be charming, but uniformity has its advantages.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade, in 1871, was endowed with further powers.  By the\r\n_Regulation of Railways Act_ of that year, they were given additional\r\nrights of inspection; authority to enquire into accidents, and further\r\npowers in regard to the opening of additional lines of railway, stations\r\nor junctions.  And by this statute the companies were required to furnish\r\nthe Board of Trade with elaborate statistical documents, annually, in a\r\nform prescribed in a schedule to the Act.\r\n\r\nThe only other important Act down to the year 1875 is the _Regulation of\r\nRailways Act_ of 1873.  This Act was passed for the purpose of making\r\n\"better provision for carrying into effect the _Railway and Canal Traffic\r\nAct_ of 1854, and for other purposes connected therewith.\"  In 1872 a\r\nJoint Committee of both Houses sat and, following upon their report, this\r\nAct was passed.  It established a new tribunal, to be called the _Railway\r\nand Canal Commission_, to consist of three Commissioners, of whom--one\r\nwas to be experienced in the law, one in railway business, and it also\r\nauthorised the appointment of not more than two _assistant_\r\nCommissioners.  As to the _third Commissioner_, no mention was made of\r\nqualifications.  This tribunal, though styled a _Commission_, conducted\r\nits work as if it were a court; and a regularly constituted court in time\r\nit became.  By the _Railway and Canal Traffic Act_, 1888, the section in\r\nthe Act of 1873 appointing the Commission was repealed and a new\r\nCommission established consisting of two appointed and three _ex officio_\r\nCommissioners, such Commission to be \"a Court of Record, and have an\r\nofficial seal, which shall be judicially noticed.\"  One of the\r\nCommissioners must be experienced in railway business; and of the three\r\n_ex officio_ Commissioners, one was to be nominated for England, one for\r\nScotland and one for Ireland, and in each case such Commissioner was to\r\nbe a Judge of the High Court of the land.  Under the Act of 1873, the\r\nchief functions of the Commissioners were: To hear and decide upon\r\ncomplaints from the public in regard to undue preference, or to refusal\r\nof facilities; to hear and determine questions of through rates; and to\r\nsettle differences between two railway companies or between a railway\r\ncompany and a canal company, upon the application of either party to the\r\ndifference.  The Act of 1888 continued these and included some further\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion the Railway Commissioners have done much useful work\r\nand done it well.  For more than forty years I have read most if not all\r\nthe cases they have dealt with.  On several occasions I have been engaged\r\nin proceedings before them, and not always on the winning side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nA GENERAL MANAGER AND HIS OFFICE\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1875, was a momentous time for me.  In the second week of that\r\nmonth I commenced my new duties at Glasgow and bade farewell for ever to\r\nthe tall stool and \"the dry drudgery of the desk's dead wood.\"  Before me\r\nopened a pleasing prospect of attractive and interesting work, brightened\r\nby the beams of youthful hope and awakened ambition.  I was now chief\r\nclerk to a general manager.  Was it to be wondered at that I felt proud\r\nand elated if also a little scared as to how I should get on.\r\n\r\nMr. Wainwright assumed the office of general manager on the first day of\r\nthe year.  I say _office_, but in fact a general manager's office\r\nscarcely existed.  His predecessor, Mr. Johnstone, a capable but in some\r\nrespects a singular man, performed his managerial duties without an\r\noffice staff, wrote all his own letters, and not only wrote them but\r\nfirst carefully drafted them out in a hand minute almost as Jonathan\r\nSwift's.  A strenuous worker, Mr. Johnstone, like most men who have no\r\nhobby, did not long survive his retirement from active business life.\r\n\r\nMr. Wainwright, who, like myself, was born in Sheffield, was twenty-three\r\nyears my senior.  His early railway life was passed in the Manchester,\r\nSheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (now the Great Central), of which the\r\nredoubtable Mr. (afterwards Sir) Edward Watkin was then the lively\r\ngeneral manager.\r\n\r\nA different man to his predecessor was Mr. Wainwright.  Unlike Mr.\r\nJohnstone he was modern and progressive.  _He_ never scorned delights or\r\nloved, for their own sake, laborious days; pleasure to him was as welcome\r\nas sunshine; and work he made a pleasure.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, no general manager's _office_ existed.  Of systematic\r\nmanagerial supervision there was none.  What was to be done?  Something\r\ncertainly, and soon.  Mr. Wainwright concurred in a suggestion I made\r\nthat I should visit Derby, see the general manager's office of the\r\nMidland there, and learn how it was conducted.  This I did.  E. W. Wells,\r\na principal clerk in that office, who was married to my cousin, showed\r\nand told me everything.  I returned laden with knowledge which I embodied\r\nin a report and my recommendations were adopted.  Several clerks were\r\nappointed and the general manager's office, of which I was chief clerk,\r\nsoon became efficient.\r\n\r\nWells afterwards became Assistant General Manager of the Midland, and\r\nFrank Tatlow, my cousin and brother of Wells' wife, is now its General\r\nManager, in succession to Sir Guy Granet.  I am not a little proud that\r\nthe attainments of one who bears the name of Tatlow, and is so nearly\r\nrelated to myself, have enabled him to reach the topmost post on a\r\nrailway such as the Midland Railway of England.  He commenced as a junior\r\nclerk in the General Manager's office and worked his way step by step to\r\nthat eminent position.  No adventitious circumstances helped him on.\r\n\r\nI became fond of railway work, which it seems to me for interest and\r\nvariety holds a high place among all the occupations by which man, who\r\nwas born to labour, may earn his daily bread.  My duties were certainly\r\narduous but intensely interesting.  The correspondence with other railway\r\ncompanies regarding agreements, joint line working, Parliamentary\r\nmatters, and many other important subjects, conducted as it required to\r\nbe, with skill, care and precision, was for me a liberal education.  The\r\nfierce rivalry which, in those days, raged in Scotland for competitive\r\ntraffic culminated often in disputes which could only be settled by the\r\nintervention of the general managers, and these brought much exciting\r\nwork into the office.  Again, the close and intimate relations between\r\nthe Midland and the Glasgow and South-Western involved interesting\r\ncommunications, meetings and discussions, and the keeping of certain\r\nspecial accounts which it fell to me to supervise.\r\n\r\nThe Midland and the Glasgow and South-Western alliance was regarded by\r\nthe West Coast Companies (the London and North-Western and the\r\nCaledonian) with much disfavour.  In their eyes it was an attack upon\r\ntheir hen roost, and it certainly resulted in the loss to them of a large\r\nshare of through traffic between England and Scotland which the West\r\nCoast route had previously had all to itself.  To carry on the\r\ncompetition successfully necessitated a large expenditure of capital by\r\nthe Glasgow and South-Western, and the Midland, of course, had to help in\r\nthis.  The original cost of Saint Enoch Station for instance was nearly\r\none and three-quarter millions sterling, and a considerable outlay was\r\nalso necessary for goods stations and other accommodation.  There was in\r\nthose days much doing between the general managers' offices of the\r\nMidland and Glasgow and South-Western companies, and it was all\r\ndelightfully new and novel to me.\r\n\r\nA Committee of Directors of the two companies, called the _Midland and\r\nGlasgow and South-Western Joint Committee_, was established.  This\r\ncommittee, with the two general managers, met periodically either at\r\nDerby, London, Carlisle or Glasgow.  Mr. Wainwright acted as secretary\r\nand I kept the minute book and papers relating to the business of the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nPullman cars had been introduced on the Midland and were run on the\r\nthrough trains between Saint Pancras and Saint Enoch.  The cars were the\r\nproperty of Mr. Pullman, but the Midland kept them in repair, the Glasgow\r\nand South-Western relieving them of a proportion of the cost\r\ncorresponding to the mileage run over their line.  Mr. Pullman received\r\nas his remuneration the extra fare paid by the passengers--three\r\nshillings each for drawing-room cars and five shillings each for sleeping\r\ncars.  Other through carriages on these trains were jointly owned by the\r\ntwo companies.  The interesting accounts connected with these\r\narrangements were supervised by me.  I commenced work with Mr. Wainwright\r\non a Monday.  The following Saturday afternoon, before leaving the\r\noffice, to my great surprise and delight, he presented me with a first-\r\nclass station to station pass over the railway.  With what pride I showed\r\nit to Tom that evening!  Six months later my salary was increased, and\r\nthe pleasant fact was announced to me by my kindly chief, coupled with\r\nthe expression of a wish that he and I might long work together.\r\n\r\nOn the Scottish railways the financial half-years ended, not in June and\r\nDecember, as in other parts of the United Kingdom, but at the end of July\r\nand January.  This was for the better equalisation of receipts, taking a\r\nmonth from the fat half-year to the lean, and giving, in exchange, a\r\nmonth from the lean to the fat.  Soon after the first-half-year was\r\nconcluded and the accounts published, which was in the month of September\r\n(my first September with the Glasgow and South-Western), Mr. Wainwright\r\nhanded to me a large sheet of closely printed figures, giving a detailed\r\nanalysis and comparison of the accounts of five of the principal English\r\nand the three principal Scottish railways in columnar form, with a\r\nrequest that I should take out the figures and compile for printing a\r\nsimilar statement for the past half-year, from the accounts of the eight\r\ncompanies.  I trembled inwardly for I had never yet looked at a railway\r\naccount, but I took them home, and, as in the case of the Acts of\r\nParliament, found them simpler than I thought; and, with less trouble\r\nthan I expected, succeeded in accomplishing the task.\r\n\r\nMr. Wainwright was himself a skilful statistician and tested everything\r\nhe could by the cold logic of figures.  I was soon surprised to find that\r\nI too had a taste for statistics and acquired some skill in their\r\ncompilation.  Up to this I had always imagined that I disliked everything\r\nin the shape of arithmetic.  At school I was certainly never fond of it,\r\nand since school my acquaintance with figures had been little more than\r\nthe adding up of long columns in huge books at the half-yearly\r\nstocktaking in the stores department at St. Rollox, a thing I detested,\r\nand which invariably gave me a headache.  Well pleased was Mr. Wainwright\r\nto see that statistics took my fancy.  As general manager he had not much\r\ntime himself to devote to them, but the office was now well manned and we\r\nwere able to establish, and keep up, tables, statistics and returns\r\nconcerning matters of railway working in a way which I have not seen\r\nsurpassed.  These statistics were of much practical use when considering\r\nquestions of economy and other matters from day to day.\r\n\r\nMy first year as general manager's clerk was, I have always thought, the\r\nmost important in my railway life.  Certainly in that year I learned much\r\nand acquired from my chief business habits which have stood me in good\r\nstead since.  Mr. Wainwright was a man of no ordinary nature, as all who\r\nknew him will admit.  He was a pattern of punctuality and promptitude,\r\nnever spared himself in doing a thing well and expected the same\r\nthoroughness in others, though he would make allowance for want of\r\ncapacity, but not for indolence or carelessness.  Straightforwardness,\r\nhonesty and rectitude marked all he did.  His word was his bond.  His\r\ndisposition was to trust those around him, and his generous confidence\r\nwas usually justified.  High-minded and possessing a keen sense of honor\r\nhimself, he had an instinctive aversion to anything mean or low in\r\nothers.  A man of great liberality and generous to a fault he often found\r\nit hard to say no, but when obliged to adopt that attitude it was done\r\nwith a tact and courtesy which left no sting.  In all business matters he\r\nrequired a rigid economy though never at the expense of efficiency.\r\n\r\nIntellectually he stood high, as I had ample opportunity of judging, but\r\nif asked what were his most striking qualities I should say _goodness_\r\nand a charm of manner which eludes description, but irresistibly\r\nattracted all who met him.  In appearance he was tall and portly, and his\r\nbearing, carriage and presence were gentlemanly and refined.  He was of\r\nfair complexion, was possessed of a delightful smile, and had side\r\nwhiskers (turning white) continued in the old-fashioned way under the\r\nchin, and yet he was so bright and debonair that he never looked\r\nold-fashioned.  Like myself he was a great lover of Dickens, and I think\r\nhis most prized possession was a small bookcase which had belonged to\r\nDickens' study and which he purchased at the sale at _Gad's Hill_.  His\r\ndirectors esteemed him highly, and the officers of the company were all\r\nsincerely attached to him.  In his room he held almost daily conferences.\r\nCorrespondence formed but a small part in his method of dealing with\r\ndepartments.  He believed in the value of _viva voce_ discussion, and\r\ndiscouraged all unnecessary inter-departmental correspondence.  In this\r\nhe was right I am sure.  The daily conferences were cheerful and\r\npleasant, for he had the delightful faculty of \"mixing business with\r\npleasure and wisdom with mirth.\"  I consider that I was singularly\r\nfortunate at this period of my life in finding myself placed in close and\r\nintimate association with such a man as Mr. Wainwright, in enjoying his\r\nconfidence as I did, and in being afforded the opportunity of benefiting\r\nby his kind precepts and fine example.\r\n\r\n[W. J. Wainwright: wainwright.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn Glasgow there was a weekly paper of much humour and spirit called _The\r\nBailie_.  With each issue it published an article on some prominent man\r\nof the day under the title of _Men You Know_, accompanied by a portrait\r\nof the person selected.  It is the Glasgow _Punch_.  It was established\r\nin 1873,and \"_Ma Conscience_!\" is its motto.  It still, I am glad to\r\nhear, runs an honorable and profitable course, which its merits well\r\ndeserve.  In its issue of September 13th, 1882, Mr. Wainwright was _The\r\nMan You Know_, and, at the request of the Editor, I wrote the article\r\nupon him.  In it are some words which, penned when I was with him daily,\r\nand his influence was strong upon me, are, perhaps, more true and\r\nfaithful than any I could at this distance of time write, and so I will\r\nquote them here, and with them conclude this chapter.\r\n\r\n\"He (_The Man You Know_) is one upon whom responsibility rests gracefully\r\nand lightly, who accomplishes great things without apparent effort, and\r\nwhose personal influence smoothes the daily friction of official life.  He\r\nrules with a gentler sway than many who are accustomed to other methods\r\nof command would believe possible.  He believes in Emerson's maxim that\r\nif you deal nobly with men they will act nobly, and his habit towards\r\neveryone around him, and its success, lends force to the genial truth of\r\nthe American philosopher.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTHE RAILWAY JUBILEE, AND GLASGOW AND SOUTH-WESTERN OFFICERS AND CLERKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 27th day of September, 1875, was the Jubilee of the British Railway\r\nSystem.  It was celebrated by a banquet given by the North-Eastern\r\nRailway Company at Darlington, for the Stockton and Darlington section of\r\nthe North-Eastern was, as I have mentioned before, the first public\r\nrailway.  A thousand guests were invited.  No building in Darlington\r\ncould accommodate such a number, and a great marquee, large enough to\r\ndine a thousand people, was obtained from London.  My chief attended the\r\nbanquet and I remained at home to hear the news when he returned.  Dan\r\nGodfrey's band was there, and Dan Godfrey himself composed some music for\r\nthe occasion.  The _menu_ was long, elaborate and imposing; equalled only\r\nby the _toast list_, which contained no less than sixteen separate\r\ntoasts.  It was a Gargantuan feast befitting a great occasion.  Could we\r\nmen of to-day have done it justice and sat it and the toast list out, I\r\nwonder.  It took place over forty years ago, when the endurance of the\r\nrace was, perhaps, greater than now; or why do we now shorten our\r\nbanquets and shirk the bottle?\r\n\r\nThe Stockton and Darlington Railway is 54 miles long, and its authorised\r\ncapital was 102,000 pounds--a modest sum indeed, under 2,000 pounds per\r\nmile, less than half the outlay for land alone of the North Midland line\r\nand not one twenty-fifth of the average cost of British railways as they\r\nstand to-day, which is some 57,000 pounds per mile.  The railway owed its\r\norigin to George Stephenson and to Edward Pease, the wealthy Quaker and\r\nmanufacturer of Darlington, both burly men, strong in mind as body.  The\r\nfirst rail was laid, with much ceremony, near the town of Stockton, on\r\nthe 23rd of May, 1822, amid great opposition culminating in acts of\r\npersonal violence, for the early railways, from interests that feared\r\ntheir rivalry, and often from sheer blind ignorance itself, had bitter\r\nantagonism to contend with.\r\n\r\nThe day brought an immense concourse of people to Darlington, all bent on\r\nseeing the novel spectacle of a train of carriages and wagons filled with\r\npassengers and goods, drawn along a _railway_ by a _steam_ engine.  At\r\neight o'clock in the morning the train started with its load--22\r\nvehicles--hauled by Stephenson's \"Locomotion,\" driven by Stephenson\r\nhimself.  \"Such was its velocity that in some parts of the journey the\r\nspeed was frequently 12 miles an hour.\"  The number of passengers reached\r\n450, and the goods and merchandise amounted to 90 tons--a great\r\naccomplishment, and George Stephenson and Edward Pease were proud men\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nSeven years from this present time will witness the _Centenary_ of the\r\nrailway system.  How shall we celebrate _it_?  Will railway proprietor,\r\nrailway director and railway manager on that occasion be animated with\r\nthe gladness, the pride and the hope that brightened the Jubilee Banquet?\r\nWho can tell?  The future of railways is all uncertain.\r\n\r\nA word or two regarding the railway system of Scotland may not be\r\ninappropriate.\r\n\r\nScotland has eight _working_ railway companies, England and Wales 104,\r\nand Ireland 28.  These include light railways, but are exclusive of all\r\nrailways, light or ordinary, that are worked not by themselves but by\r\nother companies.  Scotland has exhibited her usual good sense, her canny,\r\nthrifty way, by keeping the number of _operating_ railway companies\r\nwithin such moderate bounds.  Ireland does not show so well, and England\r\nrelatively is almost as bad as Ireland, yet England might well have shown\r\nthe path of prudence to her poorer sister by greater adventure herself in\r\nthe sensible domain of railway amalgamation.  Much undeserved censure has\r\nbeen heaped upon the Irish lines; sins have been assumed from which they\r\nare free, and their virtues have ever been ignored.  John Bright once\r\nsaid that \"Railways have rendered more service and received less\r\ngratitude than any institution in the land.\"  This is certainly true of\r\nIreland, for nothing has ever conferred such benefit upon that country as\r\nits railways, and nothing, except perhaps the Government, has received so\r\nmuch abuse.  On this I shall have more to say when I reach the period of\r\nthe Vice-Regal Commission on Irish Railways, appointed in 1906.\r\n\r\nThe average number of miles _operated_ per working railway company in\r\nScotland compared with England and Wales and Ireland, are:--\r\n\r\nScotland                       477\r\nEngland and Wales              156\r\nIreland                        121\r\n\r\nand the mileage, capital, revenue, expenditure, interest and dividends\r\nfor 1912, the latest year of which the figures, owing to the war, are\r\npublished by the Board of Trade, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                           Average rate\r\n                                                            of interest\r\n                                                           and dividend.\r\n                                                             Per cent.\r\n            Miles.     Capital.     Revenue.    Expenditure.\r\n                        Pounds       Pounds         Pounds\r\nEngland\r\n and Wales  16,223  1,103,310,000  110,499,000   70,499,000     3-58\r\nScotland     3,815    186,304,000   13,508,000    7,882,000     3-07\r\nIreland      3,403     45,349,000    4,545,000    2,842,000     3-83\r\n\r\nThe General Manager of the Glasgow and South-Western Railway and his\r\noffice I have described, but I have not spoken, except in a general way,\r\nof the other principal officers, with whom, as Mr. Wainwright's\r\nassistant, I came into close and intimate relationship.  They, alas! are\r\nno more.  I have outlived them all.  Each has played his part, and made,\r\nas we all must do, his exit from the stage of life.\r\n\r\nProminent amongst these officers was John Mathieson, Superintendent of\r\nthe Line, who was only twenty-nine when appointed to that responsible\r\npost.  We became good friends.  He began work at the early age of\r\nthirteen, had grown up on the railway and at nineteen was a station\r\nmaster.  He was skilful in out-door railway work, and an adept in\r\nmanaging trains and traffic.  Ambitious and a bit touchy regarding his\r\noffice, all was not always peace between his and other departments,\r\nparticularly the goods manager's.  The goods manager was not aggressive,\r\nand it was sometimes thought that Mathieson inclined to encroach upon his\r\nterritory.  Often angry correspondence and sometimes angry discussion\r\nensued.  Yet, take him for all in all, John Mathieson was a fine man with\r\nnothing small in his composition.  Soon his ambition was gratified.  In\r\n1889 he was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Railways of Queensland;\r\nand after a few years occupation of that post was invited by the\r\nVictorian Government to the same position in connection with the railways\r\nof that important State.  In 1900 he left Australia and became General\r\nManager of the Midland Railway; but his health unfortunately soon failed,\r\nand at the comparatively early age of sixty he died at Derby in the year\r\n1906.  In his early days, on the Glasgow and South-Western, Mathieson was\r\na hard fighter.  Those were the days when between the Scottish railway\r\ncompanies the keenest rivalry and the bitterest competition existed.  The\r\nClearing House in London, where the railway representatives met\r\nperiodically to discuss and arrange rates and fares and matters relating\r\nto traffic generally, was the scene of many a battle.  Men like James\r\nMacLaren of the North British, Tom Robertson of the Highland, Irvine\r\nKempt of the Caledonian, and A. G. Reid of the Great North of Scotland\r\nwere worthy of Mathieson's steel.  Usually Mathieson held his own.  Irvine\r\nKempt I cannot imagine was as keen a fighter as the rest, for he was\r\nrather a dignified gentleman with fine manners.  To gain a few tons of\r\nfish from a rival route, by superior service, keen canvassing, or by\r\nother less legitimate means, was a source of fierce joy to these ardent\r\nspirits.  The disputes were sometimes concerned with through traffic\r\nbetween England and Scotland, and then the English railway\r\nrepresentatives took part, but not with the keenness and intensity of\r\ntheir northern brethren, for the Saxon blood has not the fiery quality of\r\nthe crimson stream that courses through the veins of the Celt.  Now all\r\nis changed.  Combination has succeeded to competition, alliances and\r\nagreements are the tranquil order of the day, and the Clearing House has\r\nbecome a Temple of Peace.\r\n\r\nBetween David Dickie, Goods Manager, and John Mathieson, Passenger\r\nSuperintendent, as I have said, many differences arose.  I sometimes\r\nthought that Mathieson might well have shown more consideration to one so\r\nmuch his senior in years as Dickie was.  Poor Dickie!  Before I left\r\nScotland he met a tragic death.  He was a kind-hearted man, a canny Scot,\r\nand died rich.\r\n\r\nJames Stirling was the Locomotive Superintendent.  He and Mathieson did\r\nnot always agree, and the clash of arms frequently raged between them.\r\nMr. Wainwright's suavity often, and not infrequently his authority, were\r\nrequired to adjust these domestic broils, but as all deferred to him\r\nwillingly, the storms that arose were usually short lived.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Mathieson and I took a short holiday together and crossed to\r\nIreland.  It was our first visit to that unquiet but delightful country,\r\nin which, little as I thought then, I was destined a few years later to\r\nmake my home.\r\n\r\nIt was in January, 1879, that the headquarters of the company were\r\nremoved from the old and narrow Bridge Street Station to the new palatial\r\nSt. Enoch, and there a splendid set of offices was provided.  This was\r\nanother advantage much to my taste.  St. Enoch was and is certainly a\r\nmost handsome and commodious terminus.  Originally it had one great roof\r\nof a single span, second only to that of St. Pancras Station.  Other\r\nspans, not so great, have since been added, for the business of St. Enoch\r\nrapidly grew, and enlarged accommodation soon became necessary.  In 1879\r\nit had six long and spacious platforms, now it has twelve; then the\r\nnumber of trains in and out was 43 daily, now it has reached 286; then\r\nthe mileage of the railway was 319, now it is 466; then the employees of\r\nthe company numbered 4,010 and now they are over 10,000.  These figures\r\nexemplify the material growth of industrial Scotland in the forty years\r\nthat have passed.  St. Enoch Station was not disfigured by trade\r\nadvertisements, and it is with great satisfaction I learn that the same\r\ngood taste has prevailed to this day.  Not long after it was opened a\r\ngreat grocery and provision firm, the knightly head of which is still a\r\nwell-known name, offered to the company a large annual sum for the use of\r\nthe space under the platform clock, which could be seen from all parts of\r\nthe station, which the directors, on the representation of their general\r\nmanager, declined; and I am proud to remember that my own views on the\r\nsubject, pretty forcibly expressed, when my chief discussed the subject\r\nwith me, strengthened his convictions and helped to carry the day in the\r\nboard room.  The indiscriminate and inartistic way in which throughout\r\nthe land advertisements of all sorts crowd our station walls and\r\nplatforms is an outrage on good taste.  If advertisements must appear\r\nthere, some hand and eye endowed with the rudiments of art ought to\r\ncontrol them.  In no country in the world does the same ugly display mar\r\nthe appearance of railway stations; and considering what myriad eyes\r\ndaily rest on station premises it is well worth while on aesthetic\r\ngrounds to make their appearance as pleasant and as little vulgar as\r\npossible.  The question of revenue to the companies need not be ignored\r\nfor proper and efficient control would produce order, moderation,\r\nneatness, artistic effect--and profit.\r\n\r\nWith the principal clerks of the office staff my relations were very\r\npleasant.  The consideration with which I was treated by my chief, and\r\nthe footing upon which I stood with him, gave me a certain influence\r\nwhich otherwise I should not have possessed.  Till then there had been\r\nabsent from the company's staff any gathering together for purposes of\r\ncommon interest or mutual enjoyment.  The _Railway Benevolent\r\nInstitution_ provided a rallying point.  I had been appointed its\r\nrepresentative on the Glasgow and South-Western Railway and we held\r\nmeetings and arranged concerts in its aid.  Then, after a time, we\r\nestablished for the principal clerks and goods agents and certain grades\r\nof station masters, an annual day excursion into the country, with a\r\ndinner and songs and speeches.  \"Tatlow is good at the speak,\" said\r\npublicly one of my colleagues, in his broad Scotch way, and so far as it\r\nwas true this I daresay helped me.  I was made permanent president of\r\nthese excursions and feasts, and often had to \"hold forth,\" which I must\r\nconfess I rather enjoyed.  We christened ourselves _The Railway\r\nRamblers_.  The fact that I became the Scotch correspondent of the\r\n_Railway Official Gazette_, a regular contributor to the _Railway News_,\r\nand had access to the columns of several newspapers, enabled reports of\r\nour doings to appear in print, and diffused some pleasure and pride\r\nthroughout the service.  Also I became a weekly contributor of _Scotch\r\nNotes_ to the _Montreal Herald_.  In the _Railway Official Gazette_ was a\r\ncolumn devoted to short reviews of new books which were sent to the\r\neditor.  For a time, from some reason or other, I undertook this\r\nreviewing.  Possession of the books was the only recompense, though for\r\nall other work payment in money was made.  It was a daring thing on my\r\npart and I am sure many a reader of the paper must have smiled at my\r\ncriticisms.  I forget why I soon gave up the duty; probably from\r\nincompetence, for I am sure I was not at all qualified for such a task;\r\nbut what will the audacity of youth not attempt?  This journalistic work\r\noccupied much of my spare time, but it supplemented my income, a\r\nconsideration of no little importance, for in October, 1876, I had\r\nentered the married state.  My wife came from the Midlands of England.  My\r\nfriends became her friends, and other friends we made.  Children soon\r\nappeared on the scene; my bachelor days were over.\r\n\r\nSocieties amongst the staff of a railway company, whether for the purpose\r\nof physical recreation, for mutual improvement or for social enjoyment\r\nare to be much commended.  The assembling together of employees of\r\nvarious ages, filling various positions, from the several departments,\r\nfrom different districts, freed from business, and mixing on equal terms\r\nfor common objects, promotes good feeling and good fellowship, provides\r\npleasant memories for after life, gives a zest to work, and adds to the\r\nefficiency of the service.\r\n\r\nAmongst all my fellow clerks I remember one only who resembled as a\r\nborrower some of my quondam associates at Derby.  But this was in\r\nScotland where more provident ways prevailed.  He was a married man,\r\nabout 30 years of age, with a salary of 100 pounds a year.  By no means\r\nwhat one would call a nice fellow, he had nothing of the _bonhomie_ or\r\nlight-hearted good nature that distinguished my Derby friends.  He\r\npossessed a good figure, wore fierce moustaches, and affected a military\r\nair.  One suit of well-made, well-cut clothes by some means or other he\r\nmanaged to keep in a state of freshness and smoothness nothing short of\r\nmarvellous.  Borrowing was his besetting sin, and he was always head over\r\nears in debt.  Duns pursued him to the office and he sometimes hid from\r\nthem in a huge safe which the office contained.  It was a wretched life,\r\nbut he brazened it out with wonderful effrontery, and, outwardly, seemed\r\nhappy enough.  From all who would lend he borrowed, and rarely I believe\r\nrepaid.  Once I was his victim, but only once.  I lent him 3 pounds, and,\r\nstrange to say, he returned it.  Of course he approached me again, but I\r\nhad read and digested the _master's_ wisdom and determined to \"neither a\r\nborrower nor a lender be.\"\r\n\r\nProminent amongst the principal clerks was David Cooper.  When I left\r\nGlasgow he succeeded me as assistant to the general manager.  Now he is\r\ngeneral manager of the company himself.  Recently he celebrated his 50th\r\nyear of railway service.  Like me, he entered railway life in 1867; but,\r\nunlike me, has not been a rolling stone.  One company only he has served\r\nand served it well, and for nearly a quarter of a century has filled the\r\nhighest office it has to bestow.  He and I have been more fortunate than\r\nmany of our old-time colleagues.  In the list of officers of the Glasgow\r\nand South-Western to-day I see the names of two only, besides David\r\nCooper, who were principal clerks in those days--F. H. Gillies, now\r\nsecretary of the company, and George Russell, Telegraph Superintendent.\r\n\r\nIn railways, as in other departments of life, ability and industry\r\nusually have their reward; but alone they do not always command success.\r\nOther factors there are in the equation of life and not least luck and\r\nopportunity.  In those distant days, in the pride of youth, I was too apt\r\nto think that they who succeeded owed their success to themselves alone;\r\nbut the years have taught me that this is not always so, and I have\r\nlearned to sympathise more and more with those to whom opportunity has\r\nnever held out her hand and upon whom good luck has never smiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTOM\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last few chapters I have made but little mention of Tom.  The time\r\nwas drawing nearer when I was to lose him for ever.  Until early in 1876\r\nwe lived together in the closest intimacy.  We pooled our resources, and\r\nwhen either ran short of money, which often happened, the common purse,\r\nif it were not empty, was always available.  Similar in height and in\r\nfigure, our clothes, except our hats, boots and gloves, in each of which\r\nI took a larger size than he, were, when occasion required,\r\ninterchangeable.  We standardised our wardrobe as far as we could.  We\r\nrose together, ate together, retired together, and, except during\r\nbusiness hours, were rarely apart.  I being, he considered, the more\r\nprudent in money matters, kept our lodging accounts and paid the bills.\r\nHe being more musical, and a greater lover of the drama than I, arranged\r\nour visits to the theatres and concert halls.  I was the practical, he\r\nthe aesthetical controller of our joint menage.  Once I remember--this\r\noccurred before we left Derby--we both fancied ourselves in love with the\r\nsame dear enchantress, a certain dark-eyed brunette.  Each punctually\r\npaid his court, as opportunity offered, and each, when he could, most\r\nobligingly furthered the suit of the other; and this went on till the\r\ntime arrived for Tom's departure to Glasgow, when I was left in\r\npossession of the field.  Then I discovered, to my surprise, that I was\r\nnot so deeply enamoured as I had imagined; and, curiously enough, Tom on\r\nhis part had no sooner settled in Scotland than he made a similar\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Glasgow never suited Tom's health and in 1876, on the\r\nadvice of his doctors, he decided to return to England.  For a time he\r\nseemed to regain his health, but only for a time.  Soon he relapsed, and\r\nbefore another year dawned it became evident, if not to himself, to his\r\nfriends, that his years on earth were numbered.  With what grief I heard\r\nthe news, which came to me from his parents, I need not say.  Bravely for\r\na while he struggled with work, but all in vain; he had to give in, and\r\nreturn to his parents' home in Lincolnshire.  That home he never again\r\nleft, except once, in the summer of 1877, to visit my wife and me, when\r\nhe stayed with us for several weeks.  Though greatly reduced and very\r\nthin, and capable only of short walks he was otherwise unchanged; the\r\nlively fancy, the bright humor and the sparkling wit, which made him so\r\ndelightful a companion, were scarcely diminished.  He himself was\r\nhopeful; talked of recovery, planned excursions which he and I should\r\ntake together when his health returned; but his greatest pleasure was in\r\nrecalling our Derby days, our _Maypole_ visits, our country rambles, our\r\noccasional dances and flirtations, and our auld acquaintances generally.\r\n\r\nTom was remarkable for the quickness of his observation, for keen\r\npenetration of character, and for happy humorous description of\r\nparticular traits in those he met.  He possessed, too, a wonderfully\r\nretentive memory.  It is largely due to his lively descriptions of our\r\ninteresting fellow clerks at Derby that I have been able, after the lapse\r\nof half a century, to sketch them with the fidelity I have.  His humorous\r\naccounts of their peculiarities often enlivened the hours we spent\r\ntogether, and impressed their personalities more forcibly on my mind than\r\nthey otherwise would have been.\r\n\r\nWhen his visit came to an end, and he returned to his home, I too\r\nindulged in the hope that he might regain some measure of health, for he\r\nseemed much improved.  But it was a temporary improvement only, due in\r\npart, perhaps, to change in environment, and in part to the exhilaration\r\narising from our reunion, heart and mind for a time dominating the body\r\nand stimulating it to an activity which produced this fair but deceptive\r\nsemblance of health.  His letters to me breathed the spirit of hope till\r\nalmost the last.  We never met again.  The intention I had cherished of\r\ngoing to see him was never fulfilled.  The illness of my wife and the\r\ndeath of one of our children, and other unfortunate causes, prevented it;\r\nand in little more than a year and a half from our farewell grasp of the\r\nhand at the railway station in Glasgow my dear and beloved friend\r\nbreathed his last.  Often and often since I have heard again the music of\r\nhis voice, have seen his face smiling upon me, and have felt\r\n\r\n   \"_His being working in mine own_,\r\n   _The footsteps of his life in mine_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nMEN I MET AND FRIENDS I MADE\r\n\r\n\r\nTen years I served the Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company as chief\r\nclerk, or as Mr. Wainwright euphemistically called it, _assistant_ to the\r\ngeneral manager.  In that position I met from time to time, not only many\r\nprominent railway men, but also other men of mark.\r\n\r\nAmongst these, two stand out with great distinction because of the effect\r\nthey had upon me at a memorable interview I had with each.  I never\r\nforgot those interviews, and nothing that ever occurred in my life tended\r\nto strengthen in me the quality of self-reliance so much as they did.\r\nTheir effect was sudden, inspiring and lasting.  These well-remembered\r\nmen were Mr. John Burns (afterwards the first Lord Inverclyde), head of\r\nthe shipping firm of G. and J. Burns, and chairman of the Cunard Line,\r\nand Mr. John Walker, General Manager of the North British Railway.  The\r\ninterviews occurred, as nearly as I recollect, during the second or third\r\nyear of my Glasgow and South-Western life, and took place within a few\r\nweeks of each other.\r\n\r\nJohn Burns was one of the largest shareholders in the Glasgow and South-\r\nWestern Railway, his steamers plied between Greenock and Belfast, and his\r\nrelations with the company were intimate and friendly.  At the time I\r\nspeak of some important negotiations were proceeding between him and Mr.\r\nWainwright concerning the company and his firm, and whilst they were at\r\ntheir height Mr. Wainwright was unexpectedly summoned to London and\r\ndetained there.  Now Mr. Burns was a man who greatly disliked delay, and\r\nI was told to see him and, if he wished, discuss the business with him,\r\nand, if possible, further its progress.  It was the way in which Mr.\r\nBurns received me, young and inexperienced as I was, the manner in which\r\nhe discussed the subject and encouraged me, and the respect with which he\r\nlistened to my arguments, that surprised and delighted me.  I left him,\r\nfeeling an elation of spirit, a glow of pride, a confidence in myself, as\r\nnew as it was unexpected.  It is a fine trait in Scotchmen that, deeply\r\nrespecting themselves, they respect others.  Difference of class or\r\nposition does not count much with them in comparison with merit or\r\nsterling worth--\r\n\r\n   \"_The rank is but the guinea's stamp_,\r\n   _The man's the gowd for a' that_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Burns was a striking personality; strong and vigorous, mentally and\r\nphysically.  He had a good voice, and was clear, decided and emphatic in\r\nspeech.  He was a doughty champion of the Glasgow and South-Western\r\nCompany, with which at this time, affairs, like the course of true love,\r\ndid not run smooth.  The dividend was down and discontented shareholders\r\nwere up in arms.  Bitter attacks were made on the directors and the\r\nmanagement.  Not that anything was really wrong, for the business of the\r\nline was skilfully and honestly conducted, but the times were bad, and\r\n\"empty stalls make biting steeds.\"  The very same shareholders who, when\r\nreturns are satisfactory, are as gentle as cooing doves, should revenue\r\nand expenditure alter their relations to the detriment of dividend,\r\nbecome critical, carping and impossible to please, though the directors\r\nand management may be as innocent as themselves, and as powerless to stem\r\nthe tide of adversity.  At shareholders' meetings Mr. Burns was splendid.\r\nHe rose after the critics had expended their force, or if the storm grew\r\ntoo violent, intervened at its height, and with facts and figures and\r\nsound argument always succeeded in restoring order and serenity.  An\r\nexcellent story of him appeared about this time in _Good Words_.  He,\r\nAnthony Trollope and Norman Macleod were once at a little inn in the\r\nHighlands.  After supper, stories were told and the laughter, which was\r\nloud and long, lasted far into the night.  In the morning an old\r\ngentleman, who slept in a room above them, complained to the landlord of\r\nthe uproar which had broken his night's rest, and expressed his\r\nastonishment that such men should have taken more than was good for them.\r\n\"Well,\" replied the landlord, \"I am bound to confess there was much loud\r\ntalk and laughter, but they had nothing stronger than tea and fresh\r\nherrings.\"  \"Bless me,\" rejoined the old gentleman, \"if that is so, what\r\nwould they be after dinner!\"\r\n\r\nIn the entrance hall of the North British Railway Company's Waverley\r\nstation at Edinburgh stands the statue, in bronze, of Mr. John Walker.  As\r\nfar as I know this is, the whole world over, the only instance in which\r\nthe memory of a railway general manager has been so honoured.  It is of\r\nheroic size and eloquently attests his worth.  He was born in Fifeshire\r\nin 1832, and died with startling suddenness from an apoplectic seizure,\r\nat the age of fifty-nine, at Waterloo station in London.  When he left\r\nschool he was apprenticed to the law, but at the age of nineteen entered\r\nthe service of the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway.  This railway was\r\nin 1862 amalgamated with the original North British, which was first\r\nauthorised in 1844, and extended from Edinburgh to Berwick.  His\r\nexceptional ability was soon recognised and his promotion was rapid.  He\r\nbecame treasurer of the amalgamated company, and in 1866 was appointed\r\nits secretary.  In this office he rendered great service at a trying time\r\nin the company's affairs, and in 1874 was rewarded with the position of\r\ngeneral manager.\r\n\r\nThe North British Railway has had a chequered career, has suffered great\r\nchanges of fortune, and to Mr. Walker, more than to any other, is due the\r\nstability it now enjoys.  On the occasion of his death, the directors\r\nofficially recorded that, \"He served the company with such ability and\r\nunselfish devotion as is rarely witnessed; became first secretary and\r\nsubsequently general manager, and it was during the tenure of these\r\noffices that the remarkable development of the company's system was\r\nmainly effected.\"\r\n\r\nHis capacity for work was astounding.  He never seemed to tire or to know\r\nwhat fatigue meant.  Ordinary men are disposed to pleasure as well as to\r\nwork, to recreation and social intercourse as well as to business, but\r\nthis was not the case with Mr. Walker.  It must be confessed that he was\r\nsomewhat exacting with his staff, but his own example was a stimulus to\r\nexertion in others and he was well served.  One who knew him well, and\r\nfor many years was closely associated with him in railway work, tells me\r\nthat his most striking characteristics were reticence, combativeness,\r\nconcentration and tenacity of purpose, and that his memory and mastery of\r\ndetail were remarkable.  Deficient perhaps in sentiment, though in such\r\nsilent men deep wells of feeling often unsuspectedly exist, he was, by\r\nthose who served under him, always recognised as fair and just, and no\r\none had ever to complain of the slightest discourtesy at his hands.  Like\r\nLord Byron, he was lame from birth, and while this may have affected his\r\ncharacter and pursuits, it never, I am told, in business, which indeed\r\nwas practically his sole occupation, impeded his activity.  On the\r\nfailure of the City of Glasgow Bank, in 1878, which involved in ruin\r\nnumbers of people, he lost a considerable fortune.  He was a large\r\nshareholder of the bank, and the liability of the shareholders was\r\nunlimited.  He faced his loss with stoical fortitude, as I believe he\r\nwould have confronted any disaster that life could bring.\r\n\r\nOn a certain day Mr. Walker came to Glasgow by appointment to discuss\r\nwith Mr. Wainwright some outstanding matters which they had failed to\r\nsettle by correspondence.  In the afternoon Mr. Wainwright had an\r\nimportant meeting of his directors to attend.  The business with Mr.\r\nWalker was concluded in time, all but one subject, and Mr. Wainwright\r\nasked Mr. Walker if he would let me go into this with him.  Without the\r\nleast hesitation he consented; and he treated me as Mr. John Burns had\r\ndone, and discussed the matter with me as if I were on an equal footing.\r\nThis was the interview that strengthened and confirmed that self-reliance\r\nwhich Mr. Burns had awakened, and which never afterwards forsook me.\r\nGreat is my debt to Scotland and to Scotchmen.\r\n\r\nAmongst the most prominent railway men I have met were Sir Edward Watkin,\r\nChairman of the South-Eastern Railway, and the following general\r\nmanagers:--Mr. Allport, Midland, the exalted railway monarch of my early\r\nrailway days; Mr. (afterwards Sir) Henry Oakley, Great Northern; Mr.\r\nGrierson, Great Western; Mr. Underdown, Manchester, Sheffield and\r\nLincolnshire; and Mr. (afterwards Sir Myles) Fenton, South Eastern.  Of\r\nSir Edward Watkin a good story was told.  When he was general manager of\r\nthe Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (he was Mr. Watkin\r\nthen) many complaints had arisen from coal merchants on the line that\r\ncoal was being stolen from wagons in transit by engine drivers.  Nothing\r\nso disgraceful could possibly occur, always answered Mr. Watkin.  Down\r\nthe line one day, with his officers at a country station, a driver was\r\nseen in the very act of transferring from a coal wagon standing on an\r\noutlying siding some good big lumps to his tender.  This was pointed out\r\nto Mr. Watkin, who only said--\"The d---d fool, _in broad daylight_!\"  When\r\nMr. Allport learned that I came from Derby, and was the son of an old\r\nMidland official, he treated me with marked kindness.  Mr. Oakley came in\r\nthe year 1880 to Glasgow, where he sat for several days as arbitrator\r\nbetween the Glasgow and South-Western and Caledonian Railway Companies,\r\non a matter concerning the management, working, and maintenance of\r\nKilmarnock Station, of which the companies were joint owners, and I\r\nlearned for the first time how an arbitration case should be conducted,\r\nfor Mr. Oakley was an expert at such work.  This experience stood me in\r\ngood stead, when, not many years later, I was appointed arbitrator in a\r\nrailway dispute in the North of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the front rank of the railway service I do not remember many beaux.\r\nGeneral managers were men too busy to spend much time upon the study of\r\ndress.  But there were exceptions, as there are to every rule, and Sir\r\nJames Thompson, General Manager, and afterwards Chairman of the\r\nCaledonian Railway, was a notable exception.  Often, after attending\r\nClearing House meetings or Parliamentary Committees, have I met him in\r\nPiccadilly, Bond Street, or the Burlington Arcade, faultlessly and\r\nfashionably attired in the best taste, airing himself, admiring and\r\nadmired.  We always stopped and talked; of the topics of the day, the\r\nweather, what a pleasant place London was, how handsome the women, how\r\nwell dressed the men.  At the Clearing House we usually sat next each\r\nother.  I liked him and I think he liked me.  Do not think he was a beau\r\nand nothing more.  No, he was a hard-headed Scotchman, full of ability\r\nand work, and as a railway manager stood at the top of the ladder.  Next\r\nto him Sir Frederick Harrison, General Manager of the London and North-\r\nWestern Railway, was, I think, the best dressed railway man.  Both he and\r\nSir James were tall, handsome fellows, and I confess to having admired\r\nthem, perhaps as much for their good looks and their taste and style, as\r\nfor their intellectual qualities; and I have often thought that men in\r\nhigh positions would not do amiss to pay some attention to old Polonius'\r\nadmonition to his son that, \"the apparel oft proclaims the man.\"\r\n\r\nIn the friends I made I was fortunate too.  They included two or three\r\nbudding lawyers, a young engineer, a banker, a doctor, two embryo hotel\r\nmanagers, an auctioneer, and one or two journalists; and, as I have\r\nmentioned before, my artist friend _Cynicus_.  We were, most of us,\r\nfriends of each other, met often, and the variety of our pursuits gave\r\nzest and interest to our intercourse.  First amongst these friends ranked\r\nG. G., one of the young lawyers, or _writers_, as they are called in\r\nScotland.  He was my closest friend.  We have not met for many years, but\r\nthe friendship remains unweakened; for there are things that Time the\r\ndestroyer is powerless to injure.  Like myself, G. G. comes of the middle\r\nclass.  His parents, like mine, were by no means affluent, but they were\r\nScotch and held education in veneration, and were ambitious, as Scottish\r\nparents are, for their sons.  They gave him a University education, and\r\nafterwards apprenticed him to the law.  He became, and is still, a\r\nprosperous lawyer in Glasgow.\r\n\r\nThen came J. B., a young lawyer too, who blossomed into the pleasant and\r\nimportant position of Senior Deputy Town Clerk of the City of Glasgow.\r\nHe, too, had sprung from the great middle class.  Well versed in\r\nclassical lore he was a delightful companion.  He had travelled much and\r\nbenefited by his travels; was a sociable being, exceedingly good-natured,\r\nand peered through spectacles as thick as pebbles, being very\r\nshort-sighted, and without his glasses would scarcely recognise you a\r\nyard off.  Yet he could see into the heart of things as well as most men,\r\nfor he was a shrewd Scotchman, and had a pawky humour.  If he possessed a\r\nfault it was a love for a game of cards.  We played _nap_ in those days,\r\nand when a game was on it was hard to get him to bed.  He has gone over\r\nto the majority now.  His sudden death a year ago came as a great blow to\r\nhis family and a large circle of friends.  Next to G. G., as intimate\r\nfriends, came H. H. and F. K.  They were in the company's service though\r\nnot in the railway proper, but connected with the management of the hotel\r\ndepartment.  Of foreign birth, sons of a nation with whom we are now,\r\nalas! at war, they were youths of fine education, disposition and\r\nrefinement, and I became greatly attached to each.  H. H. preceded and F.\r\nK. followed me to Ireland, where he (F. K.) still resides, honoured and\r\nrespected, as he deserves to be.  He and I, throughout the years, have\r\nbeen and are the closest of friends.  Once, not very long ago, in a grave\r\ncrisis of my life, when death seemed near, he stood by me with the\r\ndevotion of a brother.  My auctioneer friend (G. F.) was, perhaps, the\r\nmost interesting man of our circle; certainly he possessed more humour\r\nthan the rest of us put together.  Fond of literature, with a talent for\r\nwriting, he was a regular contributor to the Glasgow Punch, _The Bailie_.\r\nBut his greatest charms were, his dear innocence, his freshness of mind,\r\nhis simple inexpensive tastes, his enjoyment of life, and his infectious\r\nlaugh.  In years he was our senior, but in worldly knowledge junior to us\r\nall.  He lives still and is, I believe, as jocund as ever.  Another of\r\nthese Glasgow friends I must mention--a poet, and like Burns, a son of\r\nthe soil.  His name was Alexander Anderson.  When first I met him he was\r\nin the railway service, a labourer on the permanent way, what is called a\r\nsurfaceman in Scotland, a platelayer in England and a milesman in\r\nIreland.  Self taught, he became proficient in French, German and\r\nItalian, and was able to enjoy in their own language the literature of\r\nthose countries.  A Scottish nobleman, impressed by his wonderful\r\npoetical talent, defrayed the expenses of a tour which he made in Italy\r\nand an extended stay in Rome, to the enrichment of his mind and to his\r\ngreat enjoyment.  On his return to Scotland he published a book of poems.\r\nIn an introduction to this book the Revd. George Gilfillan wrote, \"The\r\nvolume he now presents to the world is distinguished by great variety of\r\nsubject and modes of treatment.  It has a number of sweet Scottish\r\nverses, plaintive or pawky.  It has some strains of a higher mood,\r\nreminding us of Keats in their imagination.  But the highest effort, if\r\nnot also the most decided success, is his series of sonnets, entitled,\r\n'In Rome.'  And certainly this is a remarkable series.\"  A remarkable man\r\nhe was indeed; simple and earnest in manner, with a fine eye, a full dark\r\nbeard and sunburnt face.  Tiring, however, of a labourer's life and of\r\nthe pick and shovel, he left the railway and became assistant librarian\r\nof Edinburgh University, and three years afterwards Secretary to the\r\nPhilosophical Institution of Edinburgh.  He afterwards became Chief\r\nLibrarian to the Edinburgh University.  He died in the summer of 1909.  He\r\nstayed with me in Glasgow once for a week-end, and on the Sunday\r\nafternoon we together visited a friend of his who lived near, a literary\r\nman, who then was engaged in writing a series of lives of the Poets for\r\nsome publishing house.  An interesting part of our conversation was about\r\nCarlyle with whom this friend was intimate, had in fact just returned\r\nfrom visiting him at Chelsea.  He told us many interesting stories of the\r\nsage.  I remember one.  He was staying with the Carlyles, when Mrs.\r\nCarlyle was alive.  One evening at tea, a copper kettle, with hot water,\r\nstood on the hob.  Mrs. Carlyle made a movement as if to rise, with her\r\neye directed to the kettle; the friend, divining her wish, rose and\r\nhanded her the kettle.  She thanked him, and, with a pathetic and wistful\r\ngaze at Carlyle, added, \"Ay, Tam, ye never did the like o' that!\"\r\n\r\nMy first trip abroad was in 1883, and my companion, G. G.  We went to\r\nParis via Newhaven, Dieppe and Rouen, and at Rouen stayed a day and a\r\nnight, and spent about a fortnight in Paris.  We were accompanied from\r\nLondon by a friend I have not yet named, one who was well known in the\r\nrailway world, Tony Visinet, the British Engineering and Commercial Agent\r\nof the Western Railway of France; a delightful companion always, full of\r\nthe charm and vivacity that belong to his country.  He took us to see his\r\nmother at Rouen, who lived in an old-fashioned house retired from the\r\nroad, in a pleasant court-yard; a charming old lady, with whom G. G. was\r\nable to converse, but I was not.  Tony Visinet's life was full of\r\nmovement and variety.  He had lodgings in London, and a flat in Paris,\r\ntraversed the Channel continually, and I remember his proudly celebrating\r\nhis fifteen hundredth crossing.\r\n\r\nFrom childhood I had longed to see something of the world, and this\r\nexcursion to Paris was the first gratification of that wish.  Paris now\r\nis as familiar to me almost as London, but then was strange and new.\r\nRouen and its cathedral we first saw by moonlight, a beautiful and\r\nimpressive sight, idealised to me by the thought that we were in sunny\r\nFrance.  Little I imagined then how much of the world in later years I\r\nshould see; but strong desires often accomplish their own fulfilment, and\r\nso it came to pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nTERMINALS, RATES AND FARES, AND OTHER MATTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course it was right that Parliament, when conferring upon the railway\r\ncompanies certain privileges, such as the compulsory acquisition of land\r\nand property, should, in the public interest, impose restrictions on\r\ntheir charging powers.  No one could reasonably complain of this, and had\r\nit been done from the beginning in a clear, logical way, and in language\r\nfree from doubt, all might have been well and much subsequent trouble\r\navoided.  But this was not the case.  Each company's charging powers were\r\ncontained in its own private Acts (which were usually very numerous) and\r\ndiffered for different sections of the railway.  It was often impossible\r\nfor the public to ascertain the rights of the companies, and well nigh\r\nimpossible for the companies themselves to know what they were.  These\r\npowers were in the form of tolls for the use of the railway; charges for\r\nthe use of carriages, wagons, and locomotive power, and total maximum\r\ncharges which were less than the sum of the several charges.  In the Acts\r\nno mention was made of terminals, though in some of them power to make a\r\ncharge for _services incidental to conveyance_ was authorised, and what\r\nthese words really meant was the subject of much legal argument and great\r\nforensic expenditure.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the tolls and charges, the Acts usually contained a rough\r\nclassification of goods to which they applied.  These were divided into\r\nfrom three to five classes, and comprised some 50 to 60 articles.  The\r\nrailway companies, however, had in existence, for practical everyday use,\r\na general classification called The Railway Clearing House\r\nClassification, and this contained over 2,700 articles divided into seven\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThe tolls and charges in the Companies' Acts were fixed originally in the\r\nold belief (to which I have before alluded) that railway companies, like\r\ncanal companies, would be mere owners of the route; and when they became\r\ncarriers and provided stations, sidings, warehouses, cranes, and all the\r\nparaphernalia appertaining to the business of a carrier, the old form was\r\nnot altered, the charging powers remained as originally expressed in\r\nsubsequent Acts, and the same old model was followed.  For several years\r\nprior to 1881 complaints by merchants, traders and public bodies against\r\nrailway rates and fares had become very common.  The cry was taken up by\r\nthe public generally, and railway companies had a decidedly unpleasant\r\ntime of it, which they bore with that good temper and equanimity which I\r\n(perhaps not altogether an unprejudiced witness) venture to affirm\r\ngenerally characterised them.  The complaints increased in number and\r\nintensity and Members of Parliament and newspaper writers joined in the\r\njeremiad.\r\n\r\nParliament, as Parliaments do, yielded to clamour, and in 1881 a Select\r\nCommittee was appointed by the House of Commons to inquire into railway\r\ncharges, into the laws and conditions affecting such charges, and\r\nspecially into passenger fares.  It was a big committee, consisted of 23\r\nmembers, took 858 pages of evidence, and examined 80 witnesses.  At the\r\nend of the session they reported that, although they had sat\r\ncontinuously, time had failed for consideration of the evidence, and\r\nrecommended that the committee be re-appointed in the next session.  This\r\nwas done, and the committee, enlarged to 27 members, took further\r\nevidence, and submitted a report to Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe gravest issue was the right of the companies to charge terminals, and\r\nthe committee found that the railways had made out their case, and\r\nrecommended that the right of the companies to station terminals should\r\nbe recognised by Parliament.  Further, the committee, on the whole of the\r\nevidence, acquitted the railway companies of any grave dereliction of\r\ntheir duty to the public, and added: \"It is remarkable that no witnesses\r\nhave appeared to complain of 'preferences' given to individuals by\r\nrailway companies as acts of private favour or partiality.\"  As to\r\npassenger fares, the committee reported that the complaints submitted to\r\nthem were rather local than general, and not of an important character,\r\nbut thought that it might be well for the Railway Commissioners to have\r\nthe same jurisdiction in respect to passengers as to goods traffic.\r\n\r\nThe railway companies thus emerged from this searching inquiry with\r\ncredit, as they have done in the many investigations to which they have\r\nbeen subjected, and no high-minded and aspiring young railway novice need\r\never blush for the traditions of the service.\r\n\r\nBefore the committee Mr. James Grierson, General Manager of the Great\r\nWestern, was the principal witness for the railway companies, and yeoman\r\nservice he rendered.  He presented the railway case with great ability,\r\nand his views were accepted on the important terminal question.  In 1886\r\nhe published a book on _Railway Rates_, which was warmly welcomed by the\r\nPress and, in the words of _Herepath's Journal_, was \"an exhaustive,\r\nable, and dispassionate _resume_ of all the conflicting statements,\r\nclaims, and interests verging round the much vexed question of railway\r\nrates.\"  Certainly he did much towards the ultimate settlement of the\r\nmatter.  Mr. Grierson was, perhaps, the ablest witness before\r\nParliamentary Committees the railway service ever had, which is saying\r\nmuch.  A leading counsel, during the luncheon interval, once said to him,\r\n\"We feel small when we are cross-examining you.  You know all about the\r\nbusiness, and we can only touch the fringe of it.\"  The great secret of\r\nMr. Grierson's success was his mastery of, and scrupulous regard for,\r\nfacts and his straightforwardness.  Of his book he himself said, \"My\r\nconclusions may be disputed, but no one shall dispute the facts on which\r\nthey are based.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee recommended that Parliament, when authorising new lines, or\r\nextending the powers of existing companies, should have its attention\r\ndrawn by some public authority to the proposed, and in the case of\r\nexisting companies, to the existing rates and fares.  They also\r\nrecommended that one uniform classification of merchandise be established\r\nby law; that the Court of Railway Commissioners be made permanent; and\r\nthat the amalgamation of Irish Railways be promoted and facilitated.  Thus\r\nthe great inquiry ended; but public agitation did not cease.  One or two\r\nattempts at legislation followed, but from one cause or another, fell\r\nthrough; and it was not until 1888 that the subject was seriously tackled\r\nby Parliament.  In that year the _Railway and Canal Traffic Act_, of\r\nwhich I shall later on have something to say, was passed.\r\n\r\nOn the appearance of the Report in 1882, it was recognised in railway\r\ncircles that something _must_ happen regarding the eternal rates\r\nquestion, and the companies began to prepare themselves as best they\r\ncould.  It fell upon me to examine the many Acts of Parliament of the\r\nGlasgow and South-Western Railway, to collate the provisions relating to\r\ntolls, charges and maximum powers, to compare those powers with actual\r\nrates, to work out cost of terminal service, and to draw up a revised\r\nproposed scale of maximum conveyance rates and terminal charges.  Deeply\r\ninteresting work it was, and led, not very many years afterwards, to\r\nunexpected promotion, which I valued much, and about which I shall have\r\nmore to say.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1880 a Scotch branch of the Railway Benevolent Institution\r\nwas established.  Mr. Wainwright was made its chairman, and I was\r\nappointed secretary.  He and I had for some time urged upon the Board in\r\nLondon the desirability of a local committee of management in Scotland.\r\nThe Institution had a great membership in England, and was generously\r\nhelped there in the matter of funds by the public.  The subscription\r\npayable by members was small, and the benefits it bestowed were\r\nsubstantial; but railway men in Scotland looked at it askance: \"the Board\r\nin London kenned little aboot Scotland and Scotch claims wouldna get vera\r\nmuch conseederation.\"  Well, all this was changed by what we did.  Soon a\r\nnumerous membership succeeded to the few who on Scottish railways had\r\npreviously joined the Institution, and we had much satisfaction in\r\nfinding that we were able to dispense substantial aid to many old and\r\nneedy railwaymen and to their widows and orphans.  Mr. Wainwright\r\nremained Chairman of the Branch till his death, and I continued Secretary\r\nuntil I left Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, after my return from Paris, I grew restless again, with a\r\nlonging for more responsibility and a larger and freer life; with,\r\nperhaps, an admixture of something not so ennobling--the desire for a\r\nbigger income.  Never was I indifferent to the comforts that money can\r\nbring, though never, I must confess, was I gifted with the capacity for\r\nmoney making or money saving.  The pleasures of life (the rational\r\npleasures I hope) had always an attraction for me.  I could never forego\r\nthem, or forego the expense they involved, for the sake of future distant\r\nadvantages.  What weighed with me, too, was the fact that I was\r\nundoubtedly overworked and my health was suffering.  It was not that my\r\nrailway duties proper were oppressive, but the duties as Secretary of the\r\nRailway Benevolent Institution in Scotland added considerably to my\r\noffice hours, and at home I often worked far into the night writing for\r\nthe several papers to which I contributed.  Too much work and too little\r\nplay was making Jack a very dull boy.  I envied those officers, such as\r\nJohn Mathieson, whose duties took them often out of doors, and gave them\r\nthe control and management of men.\r\n\r\nMy chief was as kind and considerate as ever, and I confided to him the\r\nthoughts that disturbed me.  Warm-heartedly he sympathised with my\r\nfeelings.  He himself had gone, he said, through the same experience some\r\ntwenty years before.  The prospect of promotion at St. Enoch, he agreed,\r\nseemed remote; the principal officers, except the engineer, were young or\r\nmiddle-aged; and he himself was in the prime of life.  He did not want to\r\nlose me, but I must look out, and he would look out too.  At last the\r\nopportunity came, and it came from Ireland.  The Belfast and County Down\r\nRailway Chairman, Mr. R. W. Kelly, and a director, Lord (then Mr.)\r\nPirrie, were deputed to see half a dozen or so likely young applicants in\r\nEngland and Scotland.  I was interviewed by these gentlemen in Glasgow,\r\nwas selected for the vacant post of general manager, and in May, 1885,\r\nremoved with my family to Belfast, and entered upon my duties there.\r\n\r\nLord Pirrie is a great shipbuilder of world-wide fame.  I was not long at\r\nthe County Down before I discovered his wonderful energy, his marvellous\r\ncapacity for work, his thoroughness, and keen business ability.  I always\r\nthought that at our interview at Saint Enoch he was as much impressed\r\nwith the order and method which appeared in the office of which I had\r\ncharge as by anything else.  I showed him everything very freely, and\r\nremember his appreciation and also his criticism, of which latter, as I\r\nafterwards found, he was at times by no means sparing, but if sometimes\r\nsevere, it was always just and salutary.  How little one foresees events.\r\nNot long had I left Glasgow before unexpected changes occurred.  In 1886,\r\nMr. Wainwright took ill and died; soon after Mathieson went to\r\nQueensland; and in less than eight short years three general managers had\r\nsucceeded Mr. Wainwright.\r\n\r\nThey were good to me when I left Glasgow.  I was presented with a\r\nvaluable testimonial at a banquet at which Mr. Wainwright presided and at\r\nwhich my good friend, G. G., made a fine speech.  It would be idle for me\r\nto say that the warm congratulations of my friends, the prospects of\r\nchange, and the sense of new responsibilities, did not delight and excite\r\nme.  But a strong measure of regret was mixed with the pleasurable\r\ndraught.  I was greatly attached to my chief, and keenly felt the parting\r\nfrom him.  He felt it too.  When it came to the last handshake words\r\nfailed us both.\r\n\r\nThe Nestor of the Glasgow and South-Western Railway was Andrew Galloway,\r\nthe chief engineer.  A Nestor he looked with his fine, strong, grave\r\nfeatures, abundant hair, and flowing beard.  He was a very able engineer,\r\nbut had many old-fashioned ways, one of which was an objection to anyone\r\nbut himself opening his letters, and when absent from his office they\r\nwould at times lie for several days untouched.  If remonstrated with he\r\nwas quite unmoved.  He had a theory that most letters, if left long\r\nenough unanswered, answered themselves.  In me he always showed a\r\nfatherly interest, and sometimes chided me for talking too freely and\r\nwriting too much.  His last words when he bade me farewell, and gave me\r\nhis blessing were, to remember always to think twice before I spoke once.\r\nOn the very day I was assured of my appointment as general manager for\r\nthe County Down Railway I discarded the tall silk hat and the black\r\nmorning coat, which for some time had been my usual business garb, as it\r\nwas of many serious-minded aspiring young business men in Glasgow.  Mr.\r\nGalloway asked me the reason of the change, which he was quick to\r\nobserve.  \"Well,\" said I, \"I have secured my position, so it's all right\r\nnow.\"  Never since, except in London, have I renounced the liberty I then\r\nassumed; the bowler and the jacket suit became my regular business wear,\r\nand the other habiliments of severe respectability were relegated to\r\nchurchgoing, weddings, christenings, and funerals and other formal\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nFURTHER RAILWAY LEGISLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Chapter IX., at the outset of my Glasgow and South-Western service, I\r\nreviewed the public Acts of Parliament passed since the beginning of\r\nrailways down to the year 1875, and it may not be amiss to notice now the\r\nfurther railway legislation enacted up to 1885.\r\n\r\nThe first measure of importance was the _Railway Returns (Continuous\r\nBrakes) Act_, 1878.  The travelling public had for some years been\r\nsensitive regarding railway accidents which, though infrequent,\r\nnevertheless occurred much oftener then than now, and were more serious\r\nin their results.  The matter of their reduction began to receive the\r\nserious attention of railway engineers and inventors, and among many\r\nappliances suggested was the system of continuous brakes.  In June, 1875,\r\na great contest of brakes, extending over three days, in which trains of\r\nthe principal companies engaged, took place on the Midland railway\r\nbetween Newark and Bleasby.  A large number of brakes competed--the\r\nWestinghouse, the Vacuum, Clarke's Hydraulic, Webb's Chain, and several\r\nothers.  It is recorded that at the conclusion of the trial, each\r\npatentee left the _refreshment tent_ satisfied that his own brake was the\r\nbest; but Time is the great arbiter, and _his_ decision has been in\r\nfavour of two--the Automatic Vacuum and the Westinghouse, and these are\r\nthe brakes the companies have adopted.  The Act required all railway\r\ncompanies to submit to the Board of Trade, twice in every year, returns\r\nshowing the amount of rolling stock fitted with continuous brakes, the\r\ndescription of brake and whether self-acting and instantaneous in action.\r\nSo far there was no compulsion upon the railways to use continuous\r\nbrakes, though most of the companies were earnestly studying the subject,\r\nbut the rival claims of inventors and the uncertainty as to which\r\ninvention would best stand the test of time tended to retard their\r\nadoption.  Meanwhile, the publicity afforded by the Board of Trade\r\nReturns, and public discussion, helped to hasten events and the climax\r\nwas reached in 1889, when a terrible accident, due primarily to\r\ninefficient brake power, occurred in Ireland, and was attended with great\r\nloss of life.  The Board of Trade was in that year invested with\r\nstatutory power to _compel_ railway companies, within a given time, to\r\nprovide all passenger trains with automatic continuous brakes.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 there was also passed the _Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act_.\r\nFoot and mouth disease had for some time been rife in Great Britain and\r\nIreland, and legislation became necessary.  The Act applied not only to\r\nrailways but was also directed to the general control and supervision of\r\nflocks and herds.  It contained a number of clauses concerning transit by\r\nrail, and invested the Privy Council with authority to make regulations,\r\nthe carrying out of which, as affecting the Glasgow and South-Western\r\nRailway, devolved upon me, and for a year or two occupied much of my\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAn Act to extend and regulate the liability of employers, and to provide\r\nfor compensation for personal injuries suffered by workmen in their\r\nservice, came into force in 1880.  It was called the _Employers'\r\nLiability Act_, and was the first step in that class of legislation,\r\nwhich has since been greatly extended, and with which both employer and\r\nemployed, are now familiar.\r\n\r\nThat great convenience the _Parcel Post_, which for the first time\r\nsecured to the public the advantage of having parcels sent to any part of\r\nthe United Kingdom at a fixed charge, and which seems now as necessary to\r\nmodern life as the telephone or the telegraph, and as, perhaps, a few\r\nyears hence, the airship will be, was brought into existence by the _Post\r\nOffice (Parcels) Act_, 1882.  Under that Act it was ordained that the\r\nrailways of the United Kingdom should carry by all trains whatever\r\nparcels should be handed to them for transit by the Post Office, the\r\nrailway remuneration to be fifty-five per cent. of the money paid by the\r\npublic.  The scheme was a great success.  During the first year of its\r\noperation the parcels carried numbered over 20 millions, and in the year\r\n1913-14 (the last published figures) reached 137 millions.\r\n\r\nThe _Cheap Trains Act_, 1883, was passed to amend and consolidate the law\r\nrelating to (_a_) railway passenger duty, and (_b_) the conveyance of the\r\nQueen's Forces by railway.  It did not apply to Ireland.  Passenger duty\r\nwas never exacted in that happy land.  In Great Britain the Act relieved\r\nthe railway companies from payment of the duty on all fares not exceeding\r\none penny per mile; provided for the running of workmen's trains; and\r\nprescribed a scale of reduced fares for the conveyance of Her Majesty's\r\nsoldiers and sailors.\r\n\r\nAfter this Act, and until the year 1888, no further general railway\r\nlegislation of importance took place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nBELFAST AND THE COUNTY DOWN RAILWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter eighteen years of railway life, at the age of 34, I had attained\r\nthe coveted position of a general manager.  Of a small railway it is\r\ntrue, but the Belfast and County Down Railway, though unimposing as to\r\nmileage, was a busy and by no means an uninteresting line.  A railway\r\ngeneral manager in Ireland was in those days, strange to say, something\r\nof a _rara avis_.  There were then in the Green Isle no less than\r\neighteen separate and distinct working railways, varying from four to\r\nnearly 500 miles in length, and amongst them all only four had a _general\r\nmanager_.  The system that prevailed was curious.  With the exception of\r\nthese four general managers (who were not on the larger lines) the\r\nprincipal officer of an Irish railway was styled _Manager_ or _Traffic\r\nManager_.  He was regarded as the senior official, but over the Traffic\r\nDepartment only had he _absolute_ control, though other important duties\r\nwhich affected more than his own department often devolved upon him.  He\r\nwas, in a sense, maid of all work, and if a man of ability and character\r\nmanaged, in spite of his somewhat anomalous position, to acquire many of\r\nthe attributes and much of the influence of a real general manager.  But\r\nthe system was unsatisfactory, led to jealousies, weakened discipline,\r\nand was not conducive to efficient working.  Happily it no longer exists,\r\nand for some years past each Irish Railway has had its responsible\r\n_General Manager_.  Something that happened, in the year 1889, gave the\r\nold system the first blow.  In that year a terrible accident to a Sunday\r\nschool excursion of children occurred on the Great Northern Railway near\r\nArmagh, and was attended with great loss of life.  This led the company\r\nto appoint a General Manager, which they did in June, 1890, Thomas\r\nRobertson, of the Highland Railway of Scotland, of whom I spoke earlier\r\nin these pages, being the capable man they selected.\r\n\r\nCurious certainly was the method which up to then prevailed on the Great\r\nNorthern system.  Three different _Managers_ exercised jurisdiction over\r\nseparate sections of the line, and the _Secretary_ of the Company, an\r\nable man, stationed in Dublin, performed much more than secretarial\r\nduties, and encroached, so I often heard the managers complain, upon\r\ntheir functions.  This divided authority was a survival of the time\r\nbefore 1877, when the Great Northern system belonged to several\r\nindependent companies; and, in the words of the Allport Commission of\r\n1887, \"its continued existence after ten years could hardly be defended.\"\r\n\r\nVery pleasant and very interesting I found my new avocation on the County\r\nDown, which for short the Belfast and County Down Railway was usually\r\ncalled.  My salary certainly was not magnificent, 500 pounds a year, but\r\nit was about 100 pounds more than the whole of the income I earned in\r\nScotland, and now for the 500 pounds I had only my railway work to\r\nperform.  Now I could give up those newspaper lucubrations, which had\r\nbecome almost a burden and daily enjoy some hours of leisure.  The change\r\nsoon benefited my health.  Instead of close confinement to the office\r\nduring the day, and drudgery indoors with pen and ink at night, my days\r\nwere varied with out-door as well as in-door work, and I had time for\r\nreading, recreation and social enjoyment.  My lean and lanky form filled\r\nout, and I became familiar with the greeting of my friends: \"Why, how\r\nwell you look!\"\r\n\r\nThe County Down railway was 68 miles long.  Situated entirely in County\r\nDown, it occupied a snug little corner to itself, bounded on the north by\r\nBelfast Lough, on the south by the Mourne Mountains, and on the east by\r\nStrangford Lough and the Irish Sea.  To the west ran the Great Northern\r\nrailway but some distance away.  The County Down line enjoyed three fine\r\nsources of seaside traffic, Bangor, Donaghadee and Newcastle, and was\r\nrich in pleasure resorts and in residential districts.  It even possessed\r\nthe attractions of a golf course, the first in Ireland, the _Kinnegar at\r\nHolywood_, but more of that anon.  As I have said, it was a busy line,\r\nand it was not unprosperous.  The dividend in 1885 reached five and a-\r\nhalf per cent., and in spite of considerable expenditure necessary for\r\nbringing the line up to first-class condition, it never went back, but\r\nsteadily improved, and for many years has been a comfortable six and a-\r\nhalf per cent.  In 1885 the condition of the permanent way, the rolling\r\nstock, and the stations was anything but good, and as the traffic showed\r\ncapacity for development, to stint expenditure would have been but folly.\r\nI do not think, however, the outlay would have been so liberal as it was\r\nbut for Lord (then Mr.) Pirrie, who was an active and influential\r\ndirector, though there were also on the Board several other business men\r\nof energy and position.  Indeed, it was a good Board, but the Chairman,\r\nthough a shrewd far-seeing man, had, like John Gilpin's spouse, \"a frugal\r\nmind,\" and Lord Pirrie's bold commercial spirit quite eclipsed his\r\ncautious ways.  One instance will suffice to exemplify this, and also to\r\nillustrate the novelty of my new duties, which were delightful in their\r\ndiversity and activity to one whose life hitherto had been confined to\r\nsedentary work.\r\n\r\nIt was the rolling stock that demanded the most urgent attention--engines,\r\ncarriages and wagons and especially carriages.  Of carriages there were\r\nnot enough for the traffic of the line, and many were in a very sorry\r\ncondition, particularly those which had been taken over with the Holywood\r\nand Bangor Railway, acquired by the company the previous year.  One\r\nweekend, soon after I joined the service, I had all passenger carriages\r\nbrought into Belfast, except those employed in running Sunday trains, and\r\nearly on the Sunday morning (it was in the summer) with the company's\r\nlocomotive and mechanical engineer I examined each carriage thoroughly\r\nfrom top to bottom, inside and out, above and below, and with his\r\npractical help and expert knowledge, noted carefully down the defects of\r\neach.  He worked with a will, delighted that someone as enthusiastic and\r\neven younger than himself was now in charge.  He little suspected, I am\r\nsure, how ignorant I was of practical matters, as I kept my own counsel\r\nwhich was my habit when prudence so dictated.  I knew the names of things\r\nand was well versed in the theory and statistics of repairs and renewals,\r\nbut that was all.  A fine worker was and is R. G. Miller.  Well over 70\r\nnow, healthy and energetic still, he occupies the position he did then.\r\nAge has not withered nor custom staled his juvenility.  I met him on\r\nKingstown promenade the other day walking with an elastic step and with\r\nthe brightness of youth in his eye.  The ordinary age-retirement limit,\r\nthough a good rule generally, was not for him.  Daylight failed and night\r\ncame on before our task was finished, several carriages remaining\r\nunexamined.  These and the Sunday running vehicles we subjected to\r\nscrutiny during the following week.  At the next meeting of the Board I\r\npresented a report of what I had done, and urged that a number of new\r\ncarriages should be contracted for without delay, enlarging upon the\r\nreturn we might confidently expect from a responsive traffic.  The\r\nChairman and most of the Board were a little aghast at what appeared, to\r\na small company that had only recently emerged from straitened\r\ncircumstances, a very large order.  But Lord Pirrie came to the rescue,\r\nstrongly supported my proposal and commended the thoroughness with which\r\nI had tackled the subject.  The day was won, the carriages secure, and\r\nthe order for their construction was placed with a firm in Birmingham.\r\nThis expenditure was the precursor of further large outlays, for it was\r\nsoon seen that the prospects of the company warranted a bold course.\r\n\r\nI may, I am sure, be pardoned if I quote here some words from the report\r\nof Sir James Allport's Commission on Irish Public Works.  It is dated 4th\r\nJanuary, 1888.  I had then been less than three years with the County\r\nDown, and so could claim but a modicum of the praise it contains, and my\r\nmodesty, therefore, need not be alarmed.  The words are: \"_The history of\r\nthe Belfast and County Down Company is sufficient to show how greatly\r\nboth shareholders and the public may benefit from the infusion into the\r\nmanagement of business qualities.  In that case a board of business men\r\nhave in ten years raised the dividend on the ordinary stock from nil to\r\n5.5 per cent., while giving the public an improved service and reduced\r\nrates_.\"  My satisfaction was the greater as I had given evidence before\r\nthe Commission, and helped to tell them the cheerful story of the\r\nprogress and development of the County Down Company.  It was my first\r\nappearance as a railway witness and before Sir James Allport, who had\r\ncommanded my unbounded admiration from my first entrance at Derby into\r\nrailway life.  Need I say that to me it was an event of importance.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1875 the Board of the County Down, after an investigation of\r\nits affairs by a Committee of Shareholders, was reorganised, and it was\r\nthen that Mr. Richard Woods Kelly became Chairman, and Lord (then Mr.)\r\nPirrie a Director.  The latter has more than once since told me that the\r\nCounty Down shares were one of his best investments.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly merits more than a passing word.  Before I joined the County\r\nDown I was told he was a \"terror,\" and that I ran foolish risk in leaving\r\na service like the Glasgow and South-Western for a position in which I\r\nmight find it impossible to please.  But fears like that never disturbed\r\nme.  To wrongdoers Mr. Kelly could certainly be \"a terror,\" and\r\nwrongdoers there were, I believe, in the service in the early days of his\r\nchairmanship.  He was a mild-mannered man, tall, rather pale, with\r\nrefined features and a low-toned pleasant voice.  But beneath this smooth\r\nand gentle exterior resided great firmness.  He would smile and smile\r\nwith wonderful imperturbability and, in the quietest tones and the\r\nblandest way, say severe and cutting things.  Economy was his strong\r\npoint and he observed it in his public and private life with meritorious\r\nconsistency.  Impervious to cold, as to most other human weaknesses, in\r\nwinter or summer he never wore an overcoat.  His smooth face and tall\r\nslight figure seemed as indifferent to the angry elements as bronze or\r\nstone.  By man or Nature I never saw him ruffled or in the least degree\r\ndisturbed.  But he had his human side, as all men have, and in time I\r\ndiscovered it and grew to like him.  He was not at heart so cold as he\r\nseemed.  Though he could not write a page without mis-spelling some of\r\nthe words, his letters were always concise and very much to the point.\r\nBut it was only in spelling he was deficient.  He spoke well, was a\r\nshrewd judge of men, had a keen sense of humour, a clear perception of\r\nfacts, and was quick to detect and discard everything irrelevant.\r\n\r\nLord Pirrie and Mr. Kelly, in connection with the County Down, were hand\r\nand glove, and it was no small part they played in its transformation\r\nfrom dark and dismal poverty to smiling prosperity.\r\n\r\nMy assistant was James Pinion, afterwards my successor, and later on\r\nManager of the Cheshire Lines Committee at Liverpool.  Being a capable\r\nfellow and a hard worker, it was only natural that he felt disappointed\r\nat not being made general manager of the County Down instead of imported\r\nme; but any sign of soreness soon disappeared.  The kindness, the\r\nconsideration and the confidence I had received at Mr. Wainwright's\r\nhands, as his assistant, were not forgotten and I felt pleasure in\r\nendeavouring to treat my assistant in the same way.  It was not long\r\nbefore its effect appeared.  He told me one day that it was a new\r\nexperience for him to be so frankly trusted and so freely consulted, but\r\nit made him happier and imparted a greater zest to his work.  Certainly\r\nhe served me with enthusiastic zeal and fine loyalty.  Throughout a long\r\nperiod of railway management I have been most fortunate in securing the\r\ngoodwill and ready help of the staff, and in many instances their strong\r\npersonal attachment.  There are men no doubt whose natures are proof\r\nagainst kindness and consideration, but my experience is that they are\r\nfew and far between.  I have found also that if one refrains from fault-\r\nfinding, gives praise where praise is due, and overlooks small or venial\r\nfaults, when reproof becomes necessary, if it be temperately\r\nadministered, it is always effective and productive of good.  But even\r\nsuch reproof may be carried too far as on one occasion I found to my\r\ndismay.  Pinion, one forenoon, came into my room to tell me he had\r\ndiscovered that the man in charge of the cloak room was guilty of\r\npeculation; had been tampering with the tickets, and appropriating small\r\nsums.  I sent for him, talked to him very severely, sent him home, and\r\ntold him he should hear what would be done.  An hour later, I heard he\r\nwas _dead_: that on his way to his home he had purchased a bottle of\r\nlaudanum and swallowed the contents!\r\n\r\nIn Scotland a railway manager was rarely worried by outside interference\r\nin the management of his men.  Well intentioned people either credited\r\nhim with the possession of good sense and decent feeling, or, themselves\r\nresentful of any inter-meddling in their own affairs, refrained from\r\nmeddling in his.  But it was different I found in Ireland, even in\r\nBelfast where Scottish traditions and Scottish ways were not unknown.\r\nExceeding good nature, I suppose, is largely accountable for the\r\nreadiness with which people in the sister isle espouse, often with little\r\nconsideration, the cause of any railway employee who has or fancies he\r\nhas a grievance.  A rather ridiculous instance of this occurred soon\r\nafter my installation at the County Down.  One of my first duties was to\r\nexamine the line and the employees at each station.  At one small station\r\nI found in charge a station master in poor health and well advanced in\r\nyears--in fact quite beyond his work.  I learned that he possessed a\r\nsmall property in land and was quite willing to retire if given a few\r\nweeks in which to make his arrangements.  This, of course, I gladly\r\ngranted as well as a little parting gratuity.  He was well pleased, and\r\nwrote me to that effect.  But, to my astonishment, not many days passed\r\nbefore a long and numerously signed Memorial to the Board arrived\r\nbeseeching the Directors to stay the hand of their General Manager in his\r\nharsh and unfeeling treatment of a faithful old servant.  He was indeed a\r\nfaithful old servant; but he was quite ignorant of any memorial on his\r\nbehalf having been sent to the Directors.  Apparently the memorialists\r\ndid not consider it necessary to consult him.\r\n\r\nTo be now my own master, subject only to the control of a reasonable and\r\nbusinesslike Board of Directors, a Chairman who resided in Dublin,\r\nvisiting Belfast once a fortnight only, to have the command of men and\r\nthe working of a railway, and to be free to move about the line as I\r\nthought fit, was a pleasure indeed and made Ireland a pleasant place.  I\r\nlived near the city, but on its outskirts, with open country and sea\r\nviews around me, occupied a neat little detached house, with a bit of\r\ngarden wherein I could dig and cultivate a few roses, where the air was\r\npure and clear--a refreshing change from the confinement of a flat, four\r\nstairs up, in the crowded environs of smoky Glasgow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nBELFAST AND THE COUNTY DOWN--(continued)\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the first few years of my service on the County Down little\r\noccurred to disturb the even tenor of my way.  In a sense the duties of\r\nmy new position were simple.  There were no such things as joint lines,\r\njoint station working, running powers or joint committees, as in England\r\nand Scotland, to distract attention or consume time which could more\r\nusefully be devoted to the affairs of one's own railway.  Gradually I\r\ngrew familiar with out-door matters, and duties that seemed strange at\r\nfirst grew as easy as second nature.  I learned a good deal about\r\nsignalling, became an adept in single line working, an expert in engine\r\nrunning economies, and attained some success in the management of men.\r\n\r\nOne thing especially gave me pleasure--my monthly visit to the Managers'\r\nConference at the Irish Railway Clearing House in Dublin.  There I met my\r\nbrother managers in the Irish railway world, and learned something of the\r\nother lines.  The leading men at the Conference were Ilbery, Great\r\nSouthern and Western; Cotton, Belfast and Northern Counties; Plews and\r\nShaw, Great Northern; Ward, Midland Great Western; and Skipworth, Manager\r\nin Ireland of the London and North-Western.  Of all the managers who\r\nassembled there I was the youngest, and the greatest personality was\r\nEdward John Cotton.  By common consent, he had acted as Chairman of the\r\nConference from the year 1864.  No one had ever dreamed of assuming the\r\nposition when he was present.  This continued till 1890, when Tom\r\nRobertson came on the scene.  _He_ was all for change and innovation, and\r\nmanaged to get the principle of formal election to the chairmanship\r\nestablished.  Many of us thought it was a pity to make the change in\r\nCotton's time, but Edward John seemed the least concerned of us all, for\r\nnothing ever disturbed his good humour.  Robertson was a veritable\r\nHotspur and upset for a time the serenity of our meetings.  He was\r\novercharged with energy, and a bachelor.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that had our genial Cotton chosen the stage for a\r\nprofession he would have found a place among the distinguished actors of\r\nhis time, if not in tragedy, certainly in comedy.  His face, voice,\r\nmanner and style all proclaimed it.  You had only to hear him read in\r\npublic, which he loved to do, see how natural his dramatic action was,\r\nand feel the effect of a mere wave of his hand through his abundant hair,\r\nto be convinced of this.  In railway circles throughout England, Scotland\r\nand Ireland he was widely known.  He attended all railway conferences for\r\nhe loved movement and travel.  Shrewd and well-informed, his knowledge\r\nwas acquired not from books or study but from close observation of\r\npassing events and free and friendly intercourse with all whom he met.\r\nHis railway was very popular and he and it were held in high esteem.\r\nEasily accessible to all, courteous and reasonable ever, he was in many\r\nrespects a model railway manager.  His success lay not so much in the\r\nwork he performed himself as in obtaining the best results from those\r\naround him, and the capacity to accomplish this is certainly one of the\r\nmost useful qualities a railway manager, or any man in a position of\r\nauthority, can possess.  It is not too much to say that his staff loved\r\nhim; certainly they all admired him.  He was the readiest man I ever met\r\nto generously acknowledge the worth of those who served him, and whenever\r\npossible he took occasion to do so in public.\r\n\r\n[Edward John Cotton: cotton.jpg]\r\n\r\nI have spoken previously of the _beaux_ I knew in the higher ranks of the\r\nrailway service but, strange to say, omitted to mention Edward John who,\r\nin some respects outshone all others.  His coat may not have been cut by\r\na west-end tailor, his hat may not have been a Lincoln Bennett, or his\r\nnecktie the latest production of Burlington Arcade, but who could wear a\r\ntall white hat with a black band, with the least little rakish tilt, and\r\na light grey frock coat with a rose in the buttonhole, with such an air\r\nand grace as he?  He appreciated keenly all the good things that life can\r\ngive and loved his fellow men.  _Pax vobiscum_, kind, warm-hearted Edward\r\nJohn!  You were an ornament to the railway world and always my friend.\r\n\r\nIt was Cotton and his Chairman, the Right Hon. John Young, who put in my\r\nway my first arbitration case, to which I have in a previous chapter\r\nalluded.  This, as far as I remember, occurred in 1886.  A dispute had\r\narisen between the Northern Counties Company and a small railway company\r\nwhose line they worked, concerning, I think, the payment for and use of\r\nsome sidings.  I conducted the proceedings of course with the greatest of\r\ncare, attended, perhaps, with a little trepidation, summoned every\r\npossible witness to appear before me, and visited in state the _locus_.\r\nEdward John was, I think, a little amused.  Much older than I he had long\r\nsince passed through these youthful phases.  I issued my award, with the\r\nusual result that while each party was fairly well pleased neither was\r\naltogether satisfied.  I was proud of my _debut_ as an arbitrator,\r\nespecially as it was rewarded by, what seemed to me then, a very handsome\r\nfee.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1886, an incident that is worth narrating occurred.  In my\r\noffice a new junior clerk was required.  An advertisement in the\r\nnewspapers produced a large number of applications, and about a dozen of\r\nthe applicants were selected to be seen, one after the other, by Pinion\r\nand myself.  Before lunch one day we interviewed half a dozen or so.\r\nReturning together from lunching in the city, as we neared the station,\r\nPinion drew my attention to a youth who was evidently making for the\r\nrailway premises.  Said I to Pinion: \"If that youth is one of the\r\ncandidates, I'll be surprised if he's not the boy for us.\"  It was only a\r\nback view we had of him, but he held himself so well, walked so briskly,\r\nlooked so neat, smart, and businesslike that he arrested attention.  That\r\nboy, Charles A. Moore, then fresh from school and just fifteen, is now\r\ngeneral manager of the railway!\r\n\r\nIt was in 1886, too, that I first met Walter Bailey, between whom and\r\nmyself a friendship sprung up which grew in depth and sincerity as time\r\nwent on, lasted for thirty years, and was only terminated by his lamented\r\ndeath in January, 1917.  The friendship thus formed yielded much pleasure\r\nand happiness to me and, I think I may safely say, also to my departed\r\nfriend.  Bailey, who was about my own age, came to Ireland from the South-\r\nEastern Railway, soon after my settlement in Belfast, to fill the\r\nposition of Accountant to the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway.  Two\r\nyoung Englishmen, landed in Ireland, engaged in the same sort of\r\nbusiness, in the same city, would naturally gravitate towards each other\r\nbut, more than this, what made us such intimate friends were, tastes in\r\ncommon, similarity of views, especially concerning railway affairs, a\r\nmutual liking for literary matters, and--well, other less definable\r\nthings that form the foundation of all true friendships.  Throughout our\r\nlong intimacy we often took counsel together on subjects of mutual\r\ninterest, but it was I who sought his advice and help much oftener than\r\nhe sought mine, for he was cleverer than I.  Indeed in the whole railway\r\nworld I never met an intellect so quick, or so clear and luminous as his.\r\n\r\nBailey was the most unselfish man I ever knew; the readiest to help\r\nothers.  His pen, his remarkable stores of knowledge, and his spare time\r\ntoo, were always at the service, not only of his friends, but often of\r\nthose who were scarcely more than mere acquaintances.  The amount of work\r\nwhich he cheerfully imposed upon himself in this way was astounding and\r\nnever was it done grudgingly or half-heartedly, but always promptly and\r\ngenerously.  It afforded him a pleasure that only one endowed as he could\r\nfeel.  This part of him was often the subject of talk with those of us\r\nwho knew him well.  But what charmed _me_ most, more even than his\r\nbrilliant mental gifts, were the sweetness of his disposition and his\r\nquaintly quizzical and happy humour.  Ambition was not strong in him, was\r\nin fact all but absent, and he often rallied me on mine.  He never in all\r\nhis life asked for any improvement in salary or position; but, in spite\r\nof his inveterate modesty, rose high, became Chief Accountant of the\r\nMidland Railway of England and, I should say, the leading railway\r\naccountant in the United Kingdom.  On railway matters he was a writer of\r\ngreat skill, and all he wrote was enlivened with the happiest humour.  To\r\nthe _Railway News_ he was a valued contributor, and in railway polemics a\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n[Walter Bailey: bailey.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe Director on the County Down with whom I became most intimate was the\r\nRight Honourable (then Mr.) Thomas Andrews.  He was brother to Judge\r\nAndrews; brother-in-law of Lord Pirrie; became Chairman of the Company;\r\nwas made a Privy Councillor; a Deputy Lieutenant of Down; High Sheriff of\r\nthat County and President of this and that, for he was a man of ability\r\nand character, but simple in mind and manners as the best men mostly are.\r\nEloquent in speech, warm-hearted and impulsive, he found it difficult to\r\nresist a joke, even at the expense of his friend.  In April, 1890, he\r\nwrote me: \"I hope you were not at all annoyed at my pleasantries to Mr.\r\nPinion.  I am not exactly one of those men who would rather lose a friend\r\nthan a joke, but I find it hard to resist a joke when a good opportunity\r\npresents itself.  I am bound to say that I would be sorry to annoy you,\r\nby a jest or in any other way.\"  His temper was lively but though quickly\r\nroused soon subsided, and he never harboured resentment.  At the\r\nconclusion of the very first Board meeting I attended as general manager\r\nat the County Down, he followed me into my room, complimented me on the\r\nway I had discussed the business of the day, and added: \"I'm sure you'll\r\nbe successful in Ireland for you have the _suaviter in modo_ combined\r\nwith the _fortiter in re_.\"  It was a pretty compliment, and sincere I\r\nknew, for no one could meet him without recognising his frank outspoken\r\nnature.  On the threshold of my new work such encouragement greatly\r\ncheered me and increased my determination to do my best.  Until his\r\ndeath, not long ago, we often corresponded on railway and other matters,\r\nand he was always my staunch friend.  He had a taste, too, for poetry\r\nwhich we sometimes discussed.  The _Thomas Andrews_, who went down with\r\nthe _Titanic_ in the North Atlantic, on the 14th April, 1912, was his\r\nson, the story of whose short but strenuous life, and its tragic end, is\r\ntold in a little book written by Shan F. Bullock.  Sir Horace Plunkett\r\nwrote an introduction to it, in which he says: \"He was one of the noblest\r\nIrishmen Ulster has produced in modern times, to whom came the supreme\r\ntest in circumstances demanding almost superhuman fortitude and\r\nself-control.  There was not the wild excitement of battle to sustain\r\nhim; death had to be faced calmly in order that others--to whom he must\r\nnot even bid farewell--might live.\"  A few minutes before the end, so it\r\nis recorded, on the boat deck of the _Titanic_, the grandest sight of him\r\nwas seen, as he stood with wonderful calm, throwing overboard deck chairs\r\nto those who were struggling in the water below.  He had no thought of\r\nhimself, but only of duty and of others.  Then came the end: the\r\n_Titanic_, with a low long slanting dive went down and with her Thomas\r\nAndrews.  He was only 39, but had attained the high position of a\r\nManaging Director of the great firm of Harland and Wolff.  I knew him as\r\na boy, manly, handsome, high-spirited, clever--\"the father of the man.\"\r\nThat this terrible tragedy shortened the life of _his_ father is certain.\r\n\r\nIn 1887, and again in 1888, Bailey and I took our holidays together,\r\nvisiting Normandy, Paris, Belgium, Holland and the Rhine, doing a great\r\ndeal of walking, which he liked as much as I.  He was the prince of\r\ntravelling companions, always gay and sprightly, and spoke French with\r\ngreat fluency.  His happy disposition, unfailing good humour, and keen\r\nenjoyment of everything, even of the occasional discomforts that arose,\r\nas in travelling discomforts will arise, especially when funds are not\r\ntoo plentiful, made every hour of our holiday enjoyable.  He had the\r\nhappy gift of seeing always the humorous and the best side of things.  He\r\nacted as paymaster on our tours and presented with great regularity\r\nrecords of our joint expenditure with the neatness and accuracy of the\r\nperfect accountant.  Never a pipe smoker, he had no special interest in\r\npipes, but to me the happiness of our first holiday was increased by the\r\ncolouring of a new meerschaum.  In this delightful art I was a disciple\r\nof Samuel Swarbrick, though I needed not, as he did, the services of\r\nanother in the early stages of the colouring process.  Whoever has been\r\nthe votary of a meerschaum will understand the pride with which I\r\nfrequently displayed my pipe and its deepening colour to Bailey, often to\r\nhis great amusement I must admit.  In a hotel in the city of Antwerp,\r\nwhere we stayed for several days, we occupied adjoining bedrooms having a\r\ncommunicating door.  One night, towards early morn, but before daylight\r\nhad dawned, I was suddenly awakened out of a sound sleep, and to my\r\nastonishment saw Bailey with lighted candle standing by my bedside, with\r\na serious look on his face.  \"Great Scott! what's the matter?\" I\r\nexclaimed.  \"_My dear boy, I can't sleep; do let me see your pipe_,\" he\r\nanswered.  With such like pleasantries he beguiled the happy times we\r\nspent together.\r\n\r\nIn these years I had another pleasure: I learned to ride, taking lessons\r\nin horsemanship at a riding school in Belfast.  I soon acquired a firm\r\nseat, and my good friend H. H. (who was a practised horseman, and then\r\nlived in Belfast too) and I had many delightful rides in the beautiful\r\ncountry around the city.  For many years, so far as opportunity and means\r\nallowed, I indulged myself in this best of all exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nRAILWAY RATES AND CHARGES, THE BLOCK, THE BRAKE, AND LIGHT RAILWAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the autumn of 1888 nothing occurred to disturb the even tenor of my\r\nway, and I pursued in peace my daily work at the County Down.  It was\r\ninteresting work and pleasant to become personally acquainted with the\r\ncustomers of the company, many of whom lived in towns and villages some\r\ndistance from the railway, and to gain their good will.  It was\r\ninteresting and also satisfactory to gradually establish an improved and\r\nefficient train service and to watch the traffic expand.  It was\r\nexhilarating to engage in lively competition with carriers by road who,\r\nfor short distance traffic, keenly competed with the railway.  It was\r\ngood to introduce economies and improvements in working, and gratifying\r\nto do what one could to help and satisfy the staff--a thing, I need\r\nscarcely say, much easier to accomplish then than now.\r\n\r\nAnd so the time passed until August, 1888, when the railway world was\r\ndeeply moved by the introduction of the _Railway and Canal Traffic Act_.\r\n\r\nThis Act was the outcome of the Report of the Select Committee of 1881,\r\nbefore which Mr. James Grierson gave such weighty evidence.  One of the\r\nmost important measures Parliament ever passed, it imposed on railway\r\ncompanies an amount of labour and anxiety, prolonged and severe, such as\r\nI hope they may not have to face again.\r\n\r\nThe Act, as I have stated before, altered the constitution of the Railway\r\nCommission, and also effected minor alterations in the law relating to\r\nrailways and canals, but its main purpose was the revision of Maximum\r\nRates and Charges.  It ordered each company to prepare a revised\r\nclassification of goods and a revised Schedule of Maximum Rates, and\r\nsubmit them to the Board of Trade, who, after considering objections\r\nlodged against them, were to agree (if they could) with the companies\r\nupon a classification and schedule for adoption; and if they failed, to\r\ndetermine a classification and schedule themselves.  Public sittings at\r\nWestminster, Edinburgh and Dublin, occupying 85 days, took place, but no\r\nagreement was reached; and in their Report to Parliament the Board of\r\nTrade embodied a Revised Classification and a standard Schedule of\r\nMaximum Rates for general adoption.  The Schedule included Terminals.  In\r\naccordance with the Act, it then became necessary for this Revised\r\nClassification and Schedule to be confirmed by Parliament.  Against them\r\npetitions were lodged by both railways and traders, and the whole matter\r\nwas referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses.  This Committee sat in\r\n1891 from April till July; but it was not until January, 1893, that all\r\nwas completed and the Revised Classification and the new rates brought\r\ninto force.  Little time was afforded to the companies for their part of\r\nthe work.  The whole system of rates was changed.  New rates had to be\r\ncalculated on the new scale; thousands of rate books had to be compiled,\r\nand millions of rates altered and revised.  It was a colossal task;\r\nimpossible of fulfilment in the time allowed.  The application of the new\r\nSchedule forcibly reduced many rates, inflicting much loss upon the\r\ncompanies, and because the companies advanced other rates (within the\r\nlimits of the new maximum powers of course) to meet this loss, or to meet\r\nit to some extent, a storm of abuse arose and swept across the land.  A\r\ntrader from Berwick-on-Tweed, more frank than most, wrote the following\r\n\"characteristic\" letter as it was called at the time:--\r\n\r\n\"What we want is to have our fish carried at _half_ present rates.  We\r\ndon't care a --- whether it pays the railways or not.  Railways ought to\r\nbe made to carry for the good of the country, or they should be taken\r\nover by the Government.  That is what all Traders want and mean to try to\r\nget.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps they would not be happy if they got it!  In his clear, and most\r\ninteresting book _Railways and Their Rates_, my friend Edwin A. Pratt\r\nsays this letter was quoted in the Report which the Board of Trade made\r\nto Parliament after their 85 days' Inquiry.  The railway companies\r\nannounced that the new rates were in no sense final, that the time\r\nallowed them was insufficient for proper revision, that they would give\r\nan assurance that no increase would be made that would interfere with\r\ntrade or agriculture or diminish traffic and that, unless under\r\nexceptional circumstances, no increase would in any case exceed 5 per\r\ncent.  But all was in vain, and Parliament passed an Act which provided\r\nthat any increase whatever (though within the limits of the new statutory\r\nmaximum) if complained of, should be heard and decided upon by the\r\nRailway Commissioners, and that the onus of proving the reasonableness of\r\nthe increase should rest on the railway company.  Sir Alexander (then\r\nMr.) Butterworth, in his book on _The Law Relating to Maximum Rates and\r\nCharges on Railways_, published in 1897, says this remarkable result is\r\npresented: that Parliament, \"after probably the most protracted inquiry\r\never held in connection with proposed legislation, decided that certain\r\namounts were to be the charges which railway companies should for the\r\nfuture be entitled to make, and in 1894 apparently accepted the\r\nsuggestion that many of the charges, sanctioned after so much\r\ndeliberation, were unreasonable, and enacted that to entitle a company to\r\ndemand them, it should not be sufficient that the charge was within any\r\nlimit fixed by an Act of Parliament.\"  Thus Parliament, yielding to\r\npopular clamour, stultified itself, and in feverish haste to placate an\r\nangry and noisy public tied the hands of the railway companies, doing, I\r\nbelieve, more harm than good.  This legislation naturally made the\r\ncompanies very cautious in reducing a rate because of the difficulties to\r\nbe encountered should circumstances require them to raise it again, and\r\nrailway rates thus lost that element of elasticity and adaptability so\r\nessential to the development of trade.  Many a keen and enterprising\r\nbusiness man have I heard lament the restrictions that Parliament imposed\r\nand declare that such interference with the freedom of trade was short-\r\nsighted in the extreme and bad for the country.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the passing of the Act of 1888 the railway companies\r\nvigorously attacked the work imposed upon them.  A special meeting on the\r\nsubject was held at the Irish Railway Clearing House in Dublin for the\r\npurpose of preparing a revised Classification and Schedule of Rates.  This\r\nwas a rare opportunity for me and I eagerly availed myself of it.  Before\r\nI left Glasgow it will be remembered I had been entrusted with an\r\nexamination of the statutory charging powers of the Glasgow and South-\r\nWestern company, and with the drawing up of a suggested scale of maximum\r\nrates.  No similar work had yet been done in Ireland, and it was\r\naltogether new to the Irish companies.  I produced copies of the\r\nstatements which I had prepared in Glasgow, and they served as a basis\r\nfor what had to be done, saved much time and trouble and gained for me no\r\nlittle _kudos_.  But more than this resulted.  As I have hinted before,\r\nand as will hereafter appear, this bit of Glasgow work led to my\r\npromotion to a greater charge than the busy little County Down, which\r\nthough I loved it well, I had begun to feel I was now outgrowing.  Many\r\nother meetings at the Clearing House followed in which I took part with\r\nincreasing confidence, and in which Walter Bailey also prominently\r\nfigured.  He and I were hand and glove.  Cotton, who soon discovered that\r\nBailey was an authority on the subject, as indeed he was on most railway\r\nmatters, was not slow to profit by his knowledge and ability.  He brought\r\nhim to all our meetings, and valuable was the help that Bailey gave.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 there came into operation the _Regulation of Railways Act_.  It\r\ninvested the Board of Trade with power to order any company to adopt\r\nblock working, to interlock all points and signals, and to use on all\r\ntrains carrying passengers automatic continuous brakes.  Before issuing\r\nthe order the Board consented to hear any representations which the\r\nrailways desired to make.  The smaller companies, upon which the\r\nexpenditure involved would press very hardly, and the circumstances of\r\nwhose traffic seemed scarcely to require the same elaborate precautions\r\nfor safety in working as the bigger and more crowded systems, banded\r\ntogether and waited on the Board of Trade.  Upon me devolved the duty of\r\npresenting the case for the smaller Irish companies, and upon Conacher,\r\nof the Cambrian, for the smaller English lines.  How finely Conacher\r\nspoke I well remember.  He had an excellent voice, possessed in a high\r\ndegree the gift of concise and forcible expression, and his every word\r\ntold.  But our eloquence accomplished little--some small modification\r\nregarding mixed trains, and that was all.  Many of the lines in Ireland\r\nserving districts where population is scanty, traffic meagre, and trains\r\nconsequently infrequent, could well have been spared the costly outlay\r\nwhich the Act involved.  Three or four trains each way per day represent\r\nthe train service on many of these small railways, and some of the\r\nsections of the larger lines warrant little more.  Take, for instance,\r\nthe case of the Midland Great-Western.  On 330 out of its 538 miles not\r\nmore than six trains each way in the 24 hours are required, and they\r\ncould probably be reduced without hurting anyone.  These figures relate\r\nnot to the exceptional war time in which I pen these lines, when stern\r\nnecessity has sweepingly reduced the train service, but to pre-war days\r\nwhen normal conditions prevailed.  Half a dozen trains each way per day!\r\nIn England there are as many, or more, in the hour!\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1889 also dealt with the working hours of railway men whose\r\nduty involved the safety of trains or passengers, and required each\r\ncompany to make periodical returns of those employed for longer hours\r\nthan were to be named from time to time by the Board of Trade; and it\r\ncontained further a useful clause to the effect that the fares were in\r\nfuture to be printed on passenger tickets.  I should not be surprised if\r\nthis simple little clause has not brought more real satisfaction to the\r\nminds and hearts of the people of the British Isles than all the laboured\r\nlegislation on railway rates and charges.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1889 a great fillip was given to the extension of railways in\r\nIreland by the passing of the _Light Railways (Ireland) Act_.  It was\r\nfamiliarly known as \"Balfour's Act.\"  Mr. Balfour was then Chief\r\nSecretary of Ireland, and it was due to him that it was passed.  The Act\r\nwas designed \"to facilitate the construction of Light Railways in\r\nIreland,\" and embodied various recommendations of the Allport Commission.\r\nIt was the first introduction of the principle of State aid by free money\r\ngrants.  Such aid was conditional upon the light railway being\r\nconstructed or worked by an existing railway company, except in cases\r\nwhere the Baronies guaranteed dividends upon a portion of the capital.\r\nThe amount which the Treasury was authorised to grant was 600,000 pounds.\r\nIn 1896 this was increased by a further sum of 500,000 pounds, and both\r\nwere, in addition to a capital sum, represented by 40,000 pounds per\r\nannum which had been granted under previous legislation.  Under this Act\r\nand Acts of 1890 and 1896, over 300 miles, comprising 15 separate lines,\r\nwere constructed at a total cost, exclusive of what the railway companies\r\ncontributed, of 1,849,967 pounds, of which the Government contribution\r\nwas 1,553,967 pounds.  Although the lines were promoted under Light\r\nRailway Acts, and the Government grants were based upon light railway\r\nestimates, Parliamentary power was obtained to construct, maintain, and\r\nwork them as other than light railways.  This was taken advantage of by\r\nsome of the working companies who, in eight instances contributed\r\nthemselves a considerable amount of capital, in order that the lines\r\nshould be made sound and substantial, of the usual gauge, and such as\r\ncould be worked by the ordinary rolling stock of the company.  The\r\nMidland Great-Western, for instance, so expended no less than 352,000\r\npounds of their capital on \"Balfour Lines\" in the west.  It was a\r\nspirited thing to do.\r\n\r\nOf the 309 miles of \"light\" railways, made under the 1889 and subsequent\r\nActs, 194 were constructed on the ordinary gauge of the country, 5 feet 3\r\ninches, and the remainder on a 3-foot gauge.\r\n\r\nSeveral Light Railway or Tramway Acts were passed in Ireland between 1860\r\nand 1883, under which 295 miles of light railways at a cost of 1,389,784\r\npounds were constructed.  With the exception of the small sum of 144,804\r\npounds, the interest on the whole of this capital was guaranteed by the\r\nBaronies, the Treasury repaying the Baronies one-half but not to exceed\r\ntwo per cent.\r\n\r\nThe lines constructed under \"Balfour's Act\" are situated mostly in\r\nConnemara, Kerry, Mayo and Donegal, serving districts remote and thinly\r\npopulated, where as commercial ventures they could not have been\r\nprojected.  That they have proved to be of great benefit to the country\r\nis beyond question.  They have developed fishing and agriculture, and\r\nhave brought the tourist into districts little visited before.  Live\r\nstock and farm produce are able to reach their market, and places before\r\nisolated are in touch with the outer world.\r\n\r\nOne of the first of the railways made under the 1889 Act was a short line\r\nof 8 miles from the County Down line at Downpatrick to the little fishing\r\nvillage of Ardglass.  It stood first on the list of lines recommended for\r\nconstruction in the Report of the Allport Commission.  Primarily it was\r\nintended for the development of the herring traffic which for years had\r\nabounded on the coast, but no sooner was the line opened, than that\r\nperverse migratory fish sought other seas, and did not return to Ardglass\r\nfor I don't know how long.\r\n\r\nThe promotion of the Ardglass railway, and the steps necessary for\r\nobtaining an Order in Council for its construction and working,\r\nfamiliarised me with the Light Railway Legislation of Ireland, with which\r\nin subsequent years I was often concerned.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1889, in company with Mr. Jackson (afterwards Lord\r\nAllerton), then Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Andrews and other\r\ndirectors of the County Down, I visited Ardglass.  Under the new Act the\r\nTreasury, in connection with the projected railway construction, held the\r\npurse strings, and the Treasury, so far as we were concerned, was Mr.\r\nJackson.  We of the County Down were keen on getting the line sanctioned,\r\nand were very anxious concerning Mr. Jackson's visit.  He was a man who\r\ndrove a hard bargain, so it was said.  Certainly he was an able man, and\r\nI greatly admired him that day.  Later in life, when he was Lord\r\nAllerton, and Chairman of the Great Northern Railway of England, I met\r\nhim again and liked him well.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 there were no _light railways_ in Great Britain, or practically\r\nnone.  Except in Ireland they are of modern growth.  What really\r\nconstitutes a light railway it is not easy to say.  Commonly it is\r\nthought to be a matter of gauge, but that is not so.  Mr. Acworth says:\r\n\"such a definition is in the nature of things impossible,\" but that, \"a\r\nlight railway must be something simpler and cheaper than an ordinary\r\nrailway.\"  Mr. Cole says that \"the natural demand for a definition must\r\nhe frankly met with the disappointing reply that a hard and fast\r\ndefinition, at once concise, exact, and comprehensive is not forthcoming,\r\nand that a partial definition would be completely misleading.\"  As such\r\nauthorities are unable to furnish a definition I shall not attempt it,\r\nand will content myself with suggesting that the most recognisable\r\nfeature of a _light_ railway is its _light_ traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nGOLF, THE DIAMOND KING, AND A STEAM-BOAT SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThought not a golfer myself, never having taken to the game in earnest,\r\nor played on more than, perhaps, twenty occasions in my life, I may yet,\r\nI think, in a humble way, venture to claim inclusion amongst the pioneers\r\nof golf in Ireland, where until the year 1881 it was unknown.  In the\r\nautumn of that year the Right Honourable Thomas Sinclair, Dr. Collier, of\r\n\"British History\" fame, and Mr. G. L. Baillie, a born golfer from\r\nScotland, all three keen on the game, set themselves in Belfast to the\r\ntask of establishing a golf club there.  They succeeded well, and soon\r\nthe Belfast Golf Club, to which is now added the prefix _Royal_, was\r\nopened.  The ground selected for the links was the _Kinnegar_ at\r\nHolywood, and on it the first match was played on St. Stephen's Day in\r\n1881.  That was the beginning of golf in Ireland.  Mr. Baillie was the\r\nSecretary of the Club till the end of 1887, when a strong desire to\r\nextend the boundaries of the Royal game in the land of his adoption led\r\nhim to resign the position and cast around for pastures new.  Portrush\r\nattracted him, engaged his energies, and on the 12th May, 1888, a course,\r\nwhich has since grown famous, was opened there.  About this time I made\r\nhis acquaintance and suggested Newcastle, the beautiful terminus of the\r\nCounty Down railway, as another likely place.  On a well remembered day\r\nin December, 1888, he accompanied me there, and together we explored the\r\nground, and finished up with one of those excellent dinners for which the\r\nlessee of our refreshment rooms and his capable wife (Mr. and Mrs.\r\nLawrence) were famous, as many a golfer I am sure, recollects.  Mr.\r\nBaillie's practised eye saw at once the splendid possibilities of\r\nNewcastle.  Like myself, he was of an enthusiastic temperament, and we\r\nboth rejoiced.  I remembered the shekels that flowed to the coffers of\r\nthe Glasgow and South-Western from the Prestwick and Troon Golf Courses\r\non their line, and visions of enrichment for my little railway rose\r\nbefore me.  Very soon I induced my directors to adopt the view that the\r\nrailway company must encourage and help the project.  This done the\r\ncourse was clear.  They were not so sanguine as I, but they had not lived\r\nin Scotland nor seen how the Royal game flourished there and how it had\r\nbrought prosperity to many a backward place.  Mr. Baillie's energy, with\r\nthe company's co-operation to back it, were bound to succeed, and on the\r\n23rd March, 1889, with all the pomp and ceremony suitable to the occasion\r\n(including special trains, and a fine luncheon given by the Directors of\r\nthe Company) the Golf links at Newcastle, Co. Down, were formally opened\r\nby the late Lord Annesley.  From that time onward golf in Ireland\r\nadvanced by leaps and bounds.  Including Newcastle, there were then in\r\nthe whole country, only six clubs and now they number one hundred and\r\nsixty-eight!  The County Down Railway Company's splendid hotel on the\r\nlinks at Newcastle, with its 140 rooms, and built at a cost of 100,000\r\npounds, I look upon as the crowning glory of our golfing exploration on\r\nthat winter day in 1888.  To construct such a hotel, at such a cost, was\r\na plucky venture for a railway possessing only 80 miles of line, but the\r\nCounty Down was always a plucky company, and the Right Honourable Thomas\r\nAndrews, its Chairman, to whom its inception and completion is chiefly\r\ndue, was a bold, adventurous and successful man.\r\n\r\nAnother experience somewhat removed from ordinary railway affairs that\r\nhelped to enliven the latter part of my time on the County Down, and\r\nadded variety to the work imposed by the Railway and Canal Traffic Act\r\nand the revision of Rates and Charges, was a project in which I became\r\nengaged connected with the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nJoseph Mylchreest was a Manxman, a rough diamond but a man of sterling\r\nworth.  He left home when young and worked first as a ship's carpenter.\r\nAn adventurous spirit led him to seek his fortune in various parts of the\r\nworld--in the goldfields of California and Australia and in the silver\r\nmines of Peru and Chili.  Later on he went to South Africa, where in the\r\ndiamond mines he met with great success and made a large fortune.  His\r\nproperty there he disposed of to Cecil Rhodes, and it now, I am told,\r\nforms part of the De Beers Consolidated Company's assets.  In the late\r\neighties he returned to his native island, settled at Peel, and became a\r\nmagnate there.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon early in the year 1889 two gentlemen from the Isle of Man\r\ncalled upon me at my office.  They were Mr. Mylchreest (the \"_Diamond\r\nKing_\") and a lawyer friend whose name I forget, but I remember they\r\ninformed me they were both members of the House of Keys.  Mr. Mylchreest\r\nwas anxious to do something to develop the little port of Peel, his\r\nnative town, and a steamboat service between Peel and Belfast, Bangor or\r\nDonaghadee, seemed to him and his friends a promising project.  What did\r\nthe County Down think?  Would either Bangor or Donaghadee be better than\r\nBelfast?  If so, would my company join in and to what extent?  We had no\r\npower to expend money in steamboat enterprise, but I assured them we\r\nwould do all we could to help in other ways, and that Bangor was the port\r\nto select.  My directors heartily approved and other interviews followed.\r\nOnce, I had hurriedly to go over to Peel to meet Mr. Mylchreest and his\r\nlawyer, on a certain day, as some hitch had arisen, and by this time I\r\nwas desperately keen on getting the steamboat service started.  The only\r\nway of reaching Peel in time was by a collier steamer, belonging to the\r\nEast Downshire Coal Co., which plied between Dundrum on the Co. Down\r\ncoast, and Whitehaven; the manager of the company was my friend, and\r\nwould allow the steamer to drop me at Peel.  It was a memorable crossing,\r\nthe weather was _bad_ and so was I.  But my journey was successful, and\r\nsoon the Peel and North of Ireland Steamship Company, Limited, in which\r\nthe \"_Diamond King_\" was much the largest shareholder, was established,\r\nand on the 26th June, 1889, the first voyage was made from Peel to\r\nBangor.  It was a great event for the quiet little town of Peel.  Mr.\r\nMylchreest had invited all his friends to the inaugural service, in\r\naddition a good number of the public travelled, and the steamer arrived\r\nat Bangor with nearly 300 passengers on board.  On the return voyage from\r\nBangor to Peel the same evening the \"_Diamond King_\" gave a great dinner,\r\nchampagne and speeches freely flowed, and music and dancing enlivened the\r\nproceedings.  The service prospered for a time, but the traffic did not\r\nreach expectations.  Ultimately it was taken over by the Isle of Man\r\nSteampacket Coy., and after a few years discontinued.\r\n\r\nLittle more remains to be told of my five and a-half years' sojourn in\r\nthe north of Ireland.  They were pleasant and profitable years for mind\r\nand body.  With health improved, experience gained in _practical_ railway\r\nwork, knowledge acquired by personal contact with men of all sorts and\r\nconditions, I felt strong and confident, ready for anything, and, like\r\nMicawber, longed for something to turn up.\r\n\r\nEarly in October, 1890, Walter Bailey and I took our second Continental\r\nholiday together.  We re-visited Paris, but spent most of our three weeks\r\nin a tour through Belgium, finishing up at Brussels.  When we reached\r\nLondon I received a letter from my friend, W. R. Gill, Secretary of\r\nBailey's railway, the Belfast and Northern Counties.  It was to tell me\r\nthat the position of Manager of the Midland Great Western Railway of\r\nIreland had become vacant, and suggested that I should return home by way\r\nof Dublin and call upon the chairman of the company, Sir Ralph Cusack, in\r\nregard to the succession.  Now something _had_ turned up, and Bailey\r\ndeclared I was as good as appointed.  At dinner that night we indulged in\r\na bottle of sparkling wine--in nothing meaner would my warm-hearted\r\nfriend drink success to the prospect that had so unexpectedly opened\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\nThe Midland Great Western was the third largest railway in Ireland, nor,\r\nin the matter of length of line, was there very much between the three.\r\nThe Great Southern and Western consisted of 522 miles, the Great Northern\r\n487, and the Midland Great Western 432, nearly seven times as long as the\r\nCounty Down.  No wonder I felt elated.\r\n\r\nHow it all came about was in this way.  Skipworth, the London and North-\r\nWestern Manager in Ireland, was on very friendly terms with Sir Ralph\r\nCusack, and Sir Ralph had a high opinion of his judgment.  He consulted\r\nSkipworth about a manager and asked if he knew any railway man in\r\nIreland, not too old, who would do.  Said Skipworth, \"Tatlow of the\r\nCounty Down.  He has shown up remarkably well at the Clearing House over\r\nthis terrible Railway and Canal Traffic Act, and seems to know all about\r\nit.\"  And so I was appointed, and thus it was that the bit of work in\r\nGlasgow, of which I have spoken more than once, brought me this\r\nsubstantial promotion.  My friend Gill not long before had left the\r\nservice of the Midland Great Western, where he was Assistant Secretary,\r\nto become Secretary of the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway, and\r\nwhen Sir Ralph wrote to him about me he valiantly backed up Skipworth's\r\nfine recommendation.  Skipworth was himself for several years manager of\r\nthe Midland Great Western.  He gave up the post when he joined the London\r\nand North-Western as their Irish Manager.  It is good for a man to have\r\nfriends, and I have been fortunate throughout my life in possessing many.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1890, I left the County Down to enter upon my duties as\r\nmanager of the Midland Great Western.  The County Down Directors, at\r\ntheir Board meeting on the 16th of that month, passed a minute recording\r\ntheir \"high appreciation of the ability with which he\" (my humble self)\r\n\"has discharged his duties as general manager,\" adding that \"his uniform\r\ncourtesy, tact and judgment, added to his strict sense of honour, secured\r\nhim the confidence of the Board.\"  Need I say that I was proud of this\r\ntestimonial, and as pleased as proud, because it went on to wish me\r\nsuccess in my new duties, where I would \"have a wider field for the\r\nexercise of my talents,\" and begged my \"acceptance of a cheque as a mark\r\nof regard.\"  This was better than the _walking stick_ with which a\r\ncertain railway officer, who was not too popular with his staff, was, it\r\nis said, presented by them, when he left for a bigger post on another\r\nline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nTHE MIDLAND GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY OF IRELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nI had now completed one half of my active railway life; reached the age\r\nof 39; and, no longer a rolling stone, was settled in the service of a\r\ncompany with which I was destined to remain for the rest of my railway\r\ncareer.  That my aspirations were satisfied I do not pretend, for\r\nambition forbade any settled feeling of rest or content.  Happily, my\r\nnature inclined to the sunny side and disappointments never spoiled my\r\nenjoyment of life or marred the pleasure I found in my daily work.  My\r\nfriend, Edward John Cotton, who, like myself, was an imported Englishman,\r\nhad, like me, indulged in dreams of going back to England to fill some\r\ngreat railway post, but he had reached his sixties and his dreams were\r\nover.  Often, when we talked familiarly together, he would say: \"Joseph,\r\nif you aspire to be a general manager in England you ought never to have\r\ncome to Ireland.  They don't think much on the other side of Irish\r\nrailways or Irish railway men.\"  This, I daresay, was true, though he,\r\nwell known, liked and admired as he was, ought to have been considered an\r\nexception, and why no British railway company, when posts were going,\r\never snapped him up is hard to say.  Later on, even I, once or twice\r\nnarrowly escaped obtaining a good thing on the English side of the\r\nChannel, but it never _quite_ came off, and so I was left to make myself\r\nas happy as I could in Ireland.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was as well.  Railway life in Ireland, though not highly\r\nremunerated, had its compensations as most situations in life have.  There\r\nthe pressure of work was less constant and severe than in England.  A\r\nrailway manager was not confined to crowded cities, and enjoyed more\r\nbreathing space.  When he travelled on his line he came in contact with\r\nbucolic interests instead of the whirring wheels of trade.  Time moved\r\nmore slowly, greater leisure prevailed, the climate was softer, the\r\ncountry greener, manners easier, and more wit and humour abounded.  Yes,\r\non the whole, I was more fortunate than had my ambitious hopes been\r\nrealised to the full.  At least I think so now; and, as Hamlet says,\r\n\"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\"\r\n\r\nOne immediate advantage I gained by entering the Midland Great Western\r\nservice.  Until then I had no chance of joining a superannuation fund.\r\nThe Glasgow and South-Western had none, neither had the County Down; but\r\nthe Midland Great Western was a party to the Clearing House\r\nSuperannuation Corporation, and of it I became a member.\r\n\r\nThe Midland Great Western, as I have said, is the third largest railway\r\nin Ireland.  It stretches from the Liffey to the Atlantic, serves the\r\nplains of Meath, the wilds of Connaught, and traverses large expanses of\r\nbog.  Galway, Sligo, Westport, Athlone and Mullingar are the principal\r\ntowns on its system.\r\n\r\nWhen I became its manager, Sir Ralph Cusack had been chairman of the\r\nrailway for nearly a quarter of a century and was in his sixty-ninth\r\nyear.  He attended daily in his office, devoting much time to the\r\ncompany's affairs.  Although my position was not all I could have wished\r\nin the matter of that wide authority I coveted, and which, in my humble\r\nopinion, every railway manager should possess, it was in many respects\r\nvery satisfactory, and every lot in life has its crumpled rose leaf.  Sir\r\nRalph regarded me as an _expert_, which, notwithstanding all his long\r\nexperience as chairman, he did not himself pretend to be, and _railway\r\nexperts_ he held in high esteem.  He supported me consistently,\r\npermitting no one but himself to interfere with anything I thought it\r\nright to do.  I did not, to be sure, always get my own way, but I\r\naccomplished much, and, what I cared for most, was able to do good work\r\nfor the company.  Enthusiasm for one's work is a splendid thing, and so\r\nis loyalty to one's employers.  I make no boast of possessing these, for\r\nthey were common property; they permeated the railway service and\r\ninspired the youngest clerk as well as his chief.  Sometimes in these\r\nlatter days I imagine such things are changed, though I would like to\r\nthink it is only an old man's fancy, as it was in the case of the dear\r\nold Dubliner, who in his time had been a beaux and had reached his\r\neightieth year.  One sunny forenoon when airing himself in a fashionable\r\nstreet of the city, he was met by another old crony, who accosted him\r\nwith:--\r\n\r\n   \"Well, old friend, how are you this morning?\"\r\n\r\n   \"Oh, very well, thanks, quite well, only--\" he responded.\r\n\r\n   \"Only what?\" asked his friend.\r\n\r\n   \"Only the pavements are harder and the girls are not so pretty as they\r\n   used to be,\" he replied with a whimsical look of regret in his face\r\n   and a twinkle in his still bright eye.\r\n\r\nSir Ralph was a man of striking appearance, tall and imposing in figure.\r\nHis head was massive and fine.  His full beard was snowy white, as white\r\nas his abundant hair which was of a beautifully soft silky texture, with\r\na sheen like satin.  His voice was low and at times not very distinct.\r\nThis was disappointing as his conversation was always interesting, not\r\nonly for its intrinsic value, but also by reason of his charmingly varied\r\nand copious vocabulary, and his perfectly balanced phrases.  Naturally\r\nand without the least effort the aptest words sprang to his lips in\r\nperfect order and sequence.  His letters, too, were always exceedingly\r\nwell expressed.  He wrote a neat, sloping, rather flowing and somewhat\r\nold-fashioned hand, which greatly resembled the writing of Beau Brummell,\r\nand, like the illustrious Beau's, his numerals, which is rare nowadays,\r\nwere very clearly and very beautifully formed.  The Prince of Beaux was\r\nfastidious in his penmanship as in everything else.  Sir Ralph's half-\r\nyearly speeches to the shareholders, though delivered extempore, were\r\nmodels of perspicuity.  He used the scantiest notes, mere headings of\r\nsubjects, and a few scraps of paper containing figures which he usually\r\nremembered without their aid.  Of his memory he was proud.  One day, at a\r\nmeeting of the Board, after recalling particulars of some old transaction\r\nwhich no one else could in the least recollect, he turned to me and said:\r\n\"Well, Tatlow, you see I sometimes remember something.\"  I rejoined:\r\n\"Well, Sir Ralph, my only complaint is that you never forget anything.\"\r\nThe little compliment pleased him.  Never in his whole life, he said, had\r\nhe written out a speech, and hoped he never would, but he lived to do so\r\nonce.  As he advanced in years his voice grew weaker, and on the last\r\noccasion on which he presided at a meeting of shareholders, he wrote his\r\nspeech, or partly wrote it and, at his request, I read it to the meeting.\r\nReported verbatim his addresses read as though they had been composed and\r\nwritten with the utmost care, so precise and correct was the language and\r\nso consecutive the matter.  Though few could hope to do so well as he, I\r\nhave always thought that in addressing shareholders, railway chairmen\r\nmight trust less to formally prepared speeches and more to their powers\r\nof extemporaneous exposition.  Some chairmen do this I know, but others\r\nstill read from manuscript.  However able the matter, the reading, in my\r\njudgment, is much less effective than the spontaneous expression of the\r\nspeaker.  The atmosphere created by the meeting, often a valuable\r\nadjunct, cannot be taken advantage of when the speech is read, nor can\r\nthe chance of improvising a telling point, of enforcing an argument, or\r\nof seizing a passing mood of the audience or some fleeting incident of\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nSir Ralph was made a Director of the Midland Great Western Company in\r\n1864, and a year later was elected chairman, a position he occupied for\r\nthe long period of 39 years.  In 1864 the railway was in a very bad\r\ncondition, wretchedly run down, and woefully mismanaged.  Indeed,\r\naccording to an official report at the time, worse than mismanagement\r\nexisted.  It was stated: \"There were grave charges of official corruption\r\nwhich necessitated the retirement of one of the leading officers from the\r\ncompany's service.\"  This was very exceptional in railway history, for\r\nBritish and Irish railways possess a record that has rarely been sullied.\r\nIn my long career I only remember two other instances--one, the famous\r\n_Redpath_ fraud (a name not inappropriate for one whose destiny it was to\r\ntread a road that led to his ruin) on the Great Northern in 1856, which\r\nSir Henry (then Mr.) Oakley greatly assisted in discovering, and which, I\r\nbelieve, led to his first substantial advancement; the other on the\r\nBelfast and Northern Counties in 1886.  This was in Edward John Cotton's\r\ntime, but it would be superfluous to say that _he_ was clear of blame for\r\nhe was integrity itself.  That the occurrence could have happened during\r\nhis management distressed him greatly I know.\r\n\r\n[Sir Ralph Cusack: cusack.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhen he was elected to the office of Chairman, Sir Ralph, it is said,\r\naccepted the position on the understanding that he should have autocratic\r\npower.  In the task he undertook this was very likely desirable, and once\r\nacquired he was not the man to let such power slip from his grasp.  His\r\nstrong hands would firmly retain whatever they wished to hold.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 no less than 15 directors _adorned_ the Midland Great Western\r\nBoard, twice too many no doubt the chairman thought for a railway of 344\r\nmiles.  In 1867 they were reduced to 8; in 1877 to 7; since when they\r\nhave never numbered more.  During the long period of Sir Ralph's\r\noccupancy of the chair no deputy chairman existed.  The chairman reigned\r\nalone.  That he was an _autocratic_ chairman, his brother directors, were\r\nthey now living, would I am sure attest.  But though a strong, it was a\r\nbeneficent sway that he exercised.  He could be hard at times, but his\r\nnature was essentially kind and generous and his friendships numerous and\r\nlasting.  He prided himself on his knowledge of the railway staff, down\r\nto the humblest member.  He had strong likes and dislikes, and those who\r\ncame under his displeasure had sometimes cause to fear him; but they were\r\namongst the few, and the many remember him with nothing but the kindest\r\nfeelings.  To me he was always a warm and sincere friend, and between us\r\nexisted, without interruption, the greatest frankness and confidence.\r\n\r\nHow wonderfully adaptable a creature is man.  I had not been a fortnight\r\nin my new position when I felt myself quite at home, as though Dublin and\r\nthe West of Ireland had been my natural habitat.  Belfast and the County\r\nDown receded into the past; and shall I confess it? much as I had liked\r\nthe north, much as I admired the industry, manliness and energy of its\r\npeople, much as I had enjoyed my life there, and highly as I esteemed the\r\nfriends I had made, something I found in my new surroundings--easier\r\nmanners, more of gaiety, and an admixture of pleasure with work--that\r\nadded to life a charm I had hitherto missed, not only in the North of\r\nIreland but in Glasgow and Derby as well.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Midland Great Western Railway, George William\r\nGreene, and Martin Atock, the locomotive engineer, were good fellows, and\r\nwarm friends of each other.  I became and remained the sincere friend of\r\nboth until death took them hence.  My principal assistant, called\r\n_Assistant Manager_, was John P. Hornsby, now in his 85th year and living\r\nin New Zealand.  Robert Morrison, whom I stole for his good sense, manly\r\nworth, and excellent railway ability, from the Belfast and Northern\r\nCounties in October, 1891, succeeded Hornsby as my assistant.  Afterwards\r\nhe became goods manager at the time Thomas Elliot was appointed\r\nsuperintendent of the line, two appointments which relieved me of much\r\ndetailed work.\r\n\r\n\"The battle of Newcomen Junction\" was raging at the time I joined the\r\n\"Midland,\" as for shortness we dubbed the Midland Great Western and\r\nwhich, for the same reason, I shall continue to dub it, as convenience\r\nmay require, during the continuance of my story.  If I have occasion to\r\nagain speak of my _alma mater_, the Midland of England, it shall, for the\r\nsake of clearness, be so designated.  \"The battle of Newcomen Junction.\"\r\nWhat of it?  In railway circles, not only in Ireland but in England and\r\nScotland too, it caused some talk at the time and no little amusement.\r\nLike many another conflict, 'twere better it had never been fought, for\r\nit left for long afterwards angry feelings where peace and amity should\r\nhave existed, and it gained nothing that discussion and compromise could\r\nnot have effected.  The City of Dublin Junction Railway, a small line, a\r\nlittle over a mile in length (worked by the Dublin and South-Eastern\r\nCompany) was formed to link up the Dublin railways and to provide through\r\nroutes in connection with the Holyhead and Kingstown Royal Mail steamers\r\nand the steamers of the London and North-Western Company.  A junction was\r\nauthorised to be made at Newcomen with the Midland Great Western system.\r\nParliament had sanctioned a junction, but not such a junction, the\r\nMidland said, as it was proposed to make.  It would be unsafe and\r\nunworkable they contended, and they refused to allow it.  The promoters\r\ninsisted, the Midland were obdurate; the promoters invaded the Midland\r\npremises, knocked down a wall and entered on Midland land; the Midland\r\ngathered their forces, drove back the attacking party, and restored the\r\nwall; again the attack was made and repulsed and again the wall was\r\ndemolished and re-built, and so the warfare continued, until at length an\r\narmistice was declared and the _casus belli_ referred for settlement to\r\nthe Railway Commissioners.  Soon I had to prepare the Midland case for\r\nthe Commissioners' Court and give evidence before them.  They decided\r\nagainst us and I am sure they were right, though of course I swore, as I\r\nwas bound to do, that our opposition to the junction was natural and\r\nproper and our opponents were an unreasonable set of people.  The Railway\r\nCommissioners sat in Dublin to hear the case; it was my first appearance\r\nbefore them, and I was sorry that appearance was not in a better cause.\r\n\r\nMy first few years in Dublin were as busy as could be.  Much was astir in\r\nthe Irish railway world and particularly on the Midland, which had their\r\nshare (a larger share than the other companies) of the \"Balfour\"\r\nextension lines in hand.  The proceedings under the _Railway and Canal\r\nTraffic Act_ were also in full swing, involving frequent meetings at the\r\nIrish Clearing House, and many journeys to London.  Hard upon all this\r\ncame the work of preparing for a Parliamentary fight.  This I thought a\r\njoyful thing, and I was eager for the fray.  I had helped to prepare my\r\nold chief, Mr. Wainwright, for such contests but had never been in one\r\nmyself, had never even been inside a committee room.  In 1891 the Midland\r\ngave public notice of their intention to acquire by Act of Parliament the\r\nAthenry and Ennis Railway, and lodged a Bill for the purpose, which was\r\nvigorously opposed.  It was with great zest that I made my preparations,\r\narranged for witnesses, drafted briefs, consulted with lawyers and\r\ncounsel, and compiled my evidence, not neglecting the important matter of\r\nvisiting the district served by the railway we sought to acquire, making\r\nfriends and working up local feeling in our favour.  How the Bill\r\nproceeded, and what was its fate, will be set forth in another chapter.\r\n\r\nVery soon after I settled in Dublin I was able to carry out a long\r\ncherished wish.  Ever since I first arrived in Ireland I had hoped to be\r\nable to establish an Irish branch of the Railway Benevolent Institution,\r\nsuch as Mr. Wainwright and I had succeeded in forming in Scotland in the\r\nyear 1880, but whilst I remained in Belfast my efforts were of no avail.\r\nWhen, however, I moved to Dublin and became manager of one of the\r\nprincipal railways, the difficulties disappeared, and _The History of the\r\nRailway Benevolent Institution, its Rise and Progress from 1858 to 1897_,\r\nby _Mr. W. F. Mills_, its late Secretary, contains the following:--\r\n\r\n   \"In February, 1891, Mr. Joseph Tatlow proposed to establish a\r\n   Committee in Ireland, where supporters were few and far between, and\r\n   in the report presented at the annual meeting in June, it was stated\r\n   that 'The Board have great pleasure in announcing the appointment of a\r\n   Committee in Dublin, presided over by Mr. Tatlow, the manager of the\r\n   Midland Great-Western, and the founder of the successful Branch in\r\n   Scotland.'\"\r\n\r\nEdward John Cotton warmly seconded my efforts, for his heart was in the\r\nwork, and he was proud of telling us that he was one of the few surviving\r\nmembers of the first Board of Management of the parent Institution, which\r\nhad its first meeting in London in May, 1858.  He was then the\r\nnewly-appointed manager of the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway, and\r\nwas only twenty-eight years of age.  The Irish Branch, like the Scotch,\r\nhas been a great success.  Its Committee of Management consists of the\r\nprincipal officers of the Irish railways, and they have brought home to\r\nthe rank and file of the railway service a knowledge of the society and\r\nthe solid benefits that membership confers.  Year by year the membership\r\nhas increased, and year by year the number of old and needy railway\r\nservants, and their widows, who have been pensioned from the funds, and\r\nthe orphans who have been clothed, educated and maintained, have grown\r\ngreater and greater.  The Irish railway companies, the directors, the\r\nofficers, and the public in Ireland, generously contribute to the funds\r\nof the institution.  I filled the office of chairman of the Irish branch\r\nfor 21 years, until in fact I retired from active railway work, since\r\nwhen the chairmanship has been an annual honour conferred upon the\r\nchairman for the year of the Irish Railway Managers' Conference.  To\r\nquote again from Mr. Mills' book on the Institution:--\r\n\r\n   \"Mr. Joseph Tatlow, at the Dinner in aid of the Institution held in\r\n   Dublin on October 23rd, 1902, said: 'It is now 30 years since I first\r\n   became a collector for this Institution, and when I look back on the\r\n   past, if there is one matter in my life which contains no grain of\r\n   regret, it is my connection with the Institution, as in regard to it I\r\n   can feel nothing but honest pride and gratification.'\"\r\n\r\nI am still a member of the Irish Committee, as well as of the London\r\nBoard of Management, and those words, spoken sixteen years ago, express\r\nmy feelings to-day.\r\n\r\nWhilst writing the final words of this chapter the news reaches me of the\r\ndeath of Mr. Mills, at the fine old age of eighty-seven.  He had a long\r\nand useful life, and the railway service owes him much.  He it was whose\r\nzeal and enthusiasm firmly established the Railway Benevolent as a great\r\ninstitution.  When, in 1861, he became its secretary, the income was only\r\n1,500 pounds, and on his retirement in 1897, at the age of sixty-five, it\r\nhad grown to 53,000 pounds.  His mantle fell upon his son, Mr. A. E.\r\nMills, who inherits his father's enthusiasm and carries on the good work\r\nwith great success, as attested by the fact that for the year 1917 the\r\nincome reached 106,000 pounds.  The invested funds of the society to-day\r\namount to upwards of a million, and in 1897 they were 476,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nMr. Mills senior I knew for forty years; and I often thought that, search\r\nthe world over, it would be hard to find his equal for the work to which\r\nhis life was devoted, and for which his talents were so specially\r\nadapted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nBALLINASLOE FAIR, GALWAY, AND SIR GEORGE FINDLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days before the battle of Waterloo, during the journey to Brussels,\r\npartly by canal and partly by road, of Amelia and her party, Mrs. Major\r\nO'Dowd said to Jos Sedley: \"Talk about kenal boats, my dear!  Ye should\r\nsee the kenal boats between Dublin and Ballinasloe.  It's there the rapid\r\ntravelling is; and the beautiful cattle.\"  \"The rapid travelling\" was by\r\nwhat was called the _fly boat_, which was towed by three horses at a jog\r\ntrot, and as to cattle, the good-humoured eccentric lady, who Thackeray\r\ntells us came from County Kildare, was thinking perhaps of the great\r\nBallinasloe Fair where cattle and sheep assemble in greater numbers, I\r\nbelieve, than at any other live stock fair in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nOn the first Monday in October, 1891, to a special train of empty\r\ncarriages run by the Midland from Dublin for the purposes of this fair, a\r\nvehicle, called the directors' saloon was attached, and in it the\r\nchairman of the company, most of the directors and the principal officers\r\ntravelled to Ballinasloe, there to remain until the conclusion of the\r\nfair at the end of the week.  It was my first introduction to\r\nBallinasloe.\r\n\r\n[William Dargan: dargan.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis saloon merits a word or two.  It was built in the year 1844, was\r\noriginally the property of William Dargan, the well-known contractor and\r\nthe promoter of the Dublin Exhibition of 1853, whose statue adorns the\r\ngrounds that front the Irish National Gallery.  Dargan made the Midland\r\nrailway from Athlone to Galway, completed the work before the specified\r\ncontract time (in itself a matter worthy of note), and on its completion\r\nin 1851, presented this saloon carriage to the company, which also, I\r\nthink, deserves to be recorded.  Thus, in 1891, it was nearly 50 years'\r\nold and was handsome still.  The panels were modelled on the old stage\r\ncoach design, and a great bow window adorned each end.  In the seventies\r\nand eighties it enjoyed the distinction of being the favourite carriage,\r\non the Midland, of the Empress of Austria in her hunting days in Meath.\r\nThis fine old carriage, now in its 75th year, does good work still.  It\r\nhas had a new under frame, its roof has been raised, and it looks good\r\nfor another quarter of a century.  Perhaps, granting an originally sound\r\nconstitution, its longevity is largely due to the regular life it has\r\nled, never having been overworked, and having enjoyed many periods of\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nBallinasloe fair has two specially big days--Tuesday and Friday--the\r\nformer devoted to the sale of sheep and the latter to cattle, though in\r\nfact its commerce in cattle, sheep, horses, pigs, calves, rams and goats,\r\nnot to mention donkeys and mules, goes on more or less briskly throughout\r\nthe whole week, Saturday being remnant day when jobbers pick up bargains.\r\nIn 1891 the fair was not, and is not now, what it once was, which recalls\r\nthe answer a witty editor of _Punch_ once made to a friend.  Said the\r\nsaid friend: \"My dear fellow, _Punch_ is not so good as it used to be.\"\r\n\"No, it never was,\" came the quick rejoinder.  But of Ballinasloe fair I\r\ncannot say it never was, for a hundred years ago, in Peggy O'Dowd's time,\r\nin the west of Ireland it was the great event of the year, not only for\r\nthe sale of flocks and herds, but also for social gatherings, fun and\r\nfrolic, so at least I am told by the oldest inhabitant.  An older account\r\nstill, says these fairs were a time for games and races, pleasure and\r\namusement, and eating and feasting, whilst another record describes them\r\nas places \"where there were food and precious raiment, downs and quilts,\r\nale and flesh meat, chessmen and chess boards, horses and chariots,\r\ngreyhounds, and playthings besides.\"  It is curious that dancing is not\r\nmentioned, but dancing in the olden days in Ireland was not, I believe,\r\nmuch indulged in.  Eighty years ago over 80,000 sheep entered the fair,\r\nand 20,000 cattle.\r\n\r\nArrived at Ballinasloe we established ourselves in quarters that were\r\npart of the original station premises.  These consisted of a good sized\r\ndining-room, six bedrooms, and an office for the manager and his clerk.\r\nThe walls and ceilings of the rooms were sheeted with pitch pine and\r\nvarnished.  They were very plainly furnished, the only thing in the way\r\nof decoration being a production in watercolour representing a fair green\r\ncrowded with herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, and adorned with sundry\r\npastoral and agricultural emblems, from the brush of my friend _Cynicus_.\r\nThis I framed and hung in the dining-room.  As it had columns for\r\nrecording statistics of the fair for a period of years, it was\r\ninstructive as well as ornamental.  Three of the bedrooms were on the\r\nground floor and were small apartments.  The upstair rooms were much\r\nlarger, were situated in the roof, and were lit by skylight windows which\r\ncommanded a limited view of the firmament above but none whatever of the\r\ngreen earth below.  These upper rooms were reached by an almost\r\nperpendicular staircase surmounted by a trap door, a mode of access\r\nconvenient enough for the young and active, but not suitable for those of\r\nus who had passed their meridian.  Two of these rooms were double-bedded\r\nand all three led into each other.  In the innermost, Atock, our\r\nlocomotive engineer, and I chummed together.  He had slept there for many\r\nyears, with two previous managers, and, in Robinson Crusoe fashion, had\r\nrecorded the years by notches in a beam of the ceiling.  The notches for\r\nhim then counted twenty-three years, and number one he notched for me.\r\nEvery morning an old jackdaw perched on a chimney outside our skylight,\r\nand entertained us with his chatter.  Atock said the old bird had perched\r\nthere during all his time; and as long as I visited Ballinasloe--a period\r\nof nearly twenty years, he regularly reappeared.\r\n\r\nTo be able once a year to entertain friends and customers of the company\r\nwas one of the reasons, probably the main reason, why the directors\r\npassed the fair week at Ballinasloe.  Their hospitality was not limited\r\nto invitations to dinner, for guests were welcomed, without special\r\ninvitation, to breakfast and lunch and light refreshments during the day.\r\nIt was an arrangement which gave pleasure to both hosts and guests, and\r\nwas not without advantage to the company.  A good dinner solves many a\r\ndifficulty, whilst the post-prandial cigar and a glass of grog, like\r\nfaith, removes mountains.  One who, in the last century, became a great\r\nEnglish statesman (Lord John Russell) when twenty years of age was in\r\nSpain.  The Duc d'Infantado was President of the Spanish Ministry at the\r\ntime.  The Duke of Wellington was there too, and great banquets were\r\nbeing given.  The _Duc_ had more than once visited Lord John's home and\r\nenjoyed its hospitality, but he neglected to invite Lord John to any of\r\nhis banquets; and this is the cutting comment which the youthful future\r\nstatesman recorded in his diary: \"The Infantado, notwithstanding the\r\nchampagne and burgundy he got at Woburn, has not asked me.  Shabby\r\nfellow!  It is clear he is unfit for the government of a great kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n[The Dargan Saloon: saloon.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn the creature comforts provided at Ballinasloe the working staff was\r\nnot forgotten.  Adjacent to the station was a large room in which meals\r\nwere provided for the men, and another large room was furnished as a\r\ndormitory.  Two long sleeping carriages had also been built for the\r\naccommodation of drivers, guards and firemen, which were used also for\r\nother fairs as well as that of Ballinasloe.\r\n\r\nBallinasloe was new to me, and I felt not a little anxious concerning the\r\nworking of the fair traffic, which I knew was no child's play, and which\r\nI was told was often attended with serious delays.  Early on Tuesday\r\nmorning I was awakened, long before daylight, by the whistling of\r\nengines, the shunting of wagons and the shouting of men.  My friend Atock\r\nand I rose early, went along to the loading banks where we found the work\r\nin full swing and one special train loaded with sheep ready to start.  The\r\nentraining of sheep, not so difficult or so noisy a business as the\r\nloading of cattle, is attended with much less beating of the animals and\r\nwith fewer curses; but there was noise enough, and I can, in fancy, hear\r\nit ringing in my ears now.  Throughout the day I was besieged by\r\ngrumbling and discontented customers: want of wagons, unfair\r\ndistribution, favouritism, delays, were the burden of their complaints,\r\nand I had to admit that in the working of the Ballinasloe fair traffic\r\nall was not perfect.  The rolling stock was insufficient; trains after a\r\njourney to Meath or Dublin with stock had to return to Ballinasloe to be\r\nloaded again, which was productive of much delay; and what added to the\r\ntrouble was that everyone seemed to have a hand in the management of the\r\nbusiness.  It gave me much to think about.  Before the next year's fair I\r\nhad the whole arrangements well thrashed out, and when the eventful week\r\narrived, placed the working of the traffic under the sole control of my\r\nprincipal outside men, with excellent results.  In the course of a year\r\nor two the directors opened the purse strings and considerably increased\r\nthe engine and wagon stock of the company which helped further, and by\r\nthat time I had in charge an official, of whose energy and ability it is\r\nimpossible to speak too highly, Thomas Elliott, then a promising young\r\nassistant, now the competent Traffic Manager of the railway.  Under his\r\nmanagement the work at Ballinasloe has for many years been conducted with\r\nclock-work regularity.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 there were 25,000 sheep at the fair, 10,000 cattle and 1,500\r\nhorses, and the company ran 43 special trains loaded with stock.  The\r\nsheep fair is held in Garbally Park, on the estate of Lord Clancarty, and\r\nthe counting of the sheep through a certain narrow _gap_, and the\r\nrapidity and accuracy with which it is done, is a sight to witness.\r\n\r\nThe hospitality part of the business was attended with the success it\r\ndeserved, and helped to smooth the difficulties of the situation.  I\r\nremember well our dinner on the Tuesday night.  On the Monday we dined\r\nalone, directors and officers only, but on Tuesday the week's hospitality\r\nbegan.  That night our table was graced with five or six guests, one\r\nbeing Robert Martin, of Ross, a famous wit and _raconteur_, and the\r\nauthor of _Killaloe_.  It was a delightful party, for your Galway\r\ngentleman is a genial fellow, who likes a good dinner, and a good story\r\nwhich he tells to perfection.  Sir Ralph never took the head of the\r\ntable, liking best a less prominent seat; but his seat, wherever he chose\r\nto sit, always seemed to be to the central place.  Never lacking natural\r\ndignity, he was not punctilious in mere matters of form.  Secure in his\r\nauthority, to its outward semblance he was rather indifferent.  Another\r\ndelightful guest was Sir George (then Mr.) Morris, brother of the late\r\nLord Morris, the distinguished judge.  Until a few months previously, Mr.\r\nMorris had been a director of the company, but had resigned upon his\r\nappointment to the position of Vice-President of the Irish Local\r\nGovernment Board.  He, too, was a Galway man, big, handsome, with a fine\r\nflowing beard, a fund of humour, and the most genial disposition\r\nimaginable.  His anecdotes were ever welcome, and the smallest incident,\r\nembellished by his wit and fancy, and told in his rich brogue, which he\r\nloved, were always sufficient to adorn a tale.  He was rare company, and\r\nthough, perhaps, he could not, like Swift, have written eloquently on a\r\nbroomstick, he could always talk delightfully on any subject he chose.\r\n\r\nWhilst Sir Ralph remained chairman of the company, which he did until the\r\nyear 1904, the directors annual stay at Ballinasloe and its attendant\r\nhospitality continued.  He was not likely to give up a good old custom.\r\nBut time inevitably brings changes; for some years now the old\r\nhospitality has ceased, the rooms at Ballinasloe are turned into house\r\naccommodation for one or two of the staff, and the great fair is worked\r\nwith no more ado than a hundred other fairs on the line.  Not many\r\ncomplaints are made now, for delays and disappointments are things of the\r\npast.  Yet, I dare say there are some who, still attending the fair, look\r\nback with regret on the disappearance of the good old days.\r\n\r\nBallinasloe station is on the main line to Galway, 34 miles distant from\r\nthe \"City of the Tribes.\"  Galway is the principal western terminus of\r\nthe Midland railway.  It was once a famous city, but its glory has gone.\r\nIn 1831 its population was 33,000; to-day it is 13,000!  Then, measured\r\nby inhabitants, it was the fifth town in Ireland; now it is the eighth.\r\nThen it had a large trade with Spain and France, and was a place of note\r\nfor general trade and commerce; now its harbour is almost idle, and its\r\nwarehouses and stores nearly empty.  Many of its stately old houses have\r\ndisappeared, and those that remain are mostly now tenements of the poor.\r\nNot so very long ago Galway had a trans-Atlantic steamship service, and\r\nwhen the railway was opened in 1851, there was opened also a fine hotel\r\nadjoining the station, which the company had built, chiefly for trans-\r\nAtlantic business, at a cost of 30,000 pounds.  It may be that better\r\ntimes are in store.  Some day great harbour works will adorn the bay of\r\nGalway, from which fine steamers, forming part of an Imperial route to\r\nour Dominions and beyond, shall sail, and shorten the Atlantic voyage.  A\r\ntunnel too, _uniting_ Great Britain and Ireland, may be made, which all\r\nwill agree, is \"a consummation devoutly to be wished.\"\r\n\r\nGalway is the gateway to Connemara, and Connemara is one of the best\r\nplaces under the sun for a healthy and enjoyable holiday.  To be sure the\r\nsun does not always shine when expected, but he is seen much oftener than\r\nis generally believed.  Of course, it sometimes rains, but the rain never\r\nlasts long, for no place has such quick and surprising climatic changes\r\nas the west of Ireland or such enchanting atmospheric effects.  I soon\r\nbecame enamoured of Connemara, and for several years, in whatever time I\r\ncould call my own, explored its mountain roads and valleys, sometimes on\r\nhorseback, sometimes afoot, and sometimes on bicycle or outside car.  The\r\nconstruction of our \"Balfour\" extension line from Galway to Clifden,\r\nbegun in 1891 and finished in 1895, often called me on business to the\r\nwilds it penetrated, and gladly I always answered the call.  Sometimes on\r\nthese excursions one had to rough it a little, for hotel accommodation\r\nwas scarce and scanty in some of the districts, but in one's early\r\nforties such trifles scarcely count.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I took up office at Broadstone, Sir Ralph informed me I was to\r\nbe chairman of the Midland Great Western Benefit Society, which was\r\npartly a sick fund, partly a pension fund and applied to all the wages\r\nstaff.  It was managed by a committee of twelve, half of whom were\r\nappointed by the directors and half by the employees.  Gladly I undertook\r\na post which would bring me into close touch with the men.  I made a\r\npoint of never, if I could help it, being absent from a committee\r\nmeeting; nor, more particularly, from the annual general meeting of the\r\nsociety when I had to give an address.  It was always to me a pleasure to\r\nmeet the men, to learn their views, and to help them as far as I could.\r\nThis they soon discovered, and I had the satisfaction of knowing that I\r\nwas liked and trusted.  Early in life I had learned to sympathise with\r\nthe wants and wishes of others, and sympathy I found increased one's\r\npower of usefulness.  By sympathy I do not mean agreeing always with the\r\nmen and their views, and I never hesitated to strongly express to them my\r\nown convictions, and rarely it was that they ever in the least resented\r\nthe plainest speaking.  I believe if the responsible leaders of labour\r\nwould follow a similar course, it would be better for themselves, for the\r\nmen they lead, and for the world at large.  The deputy-chairman of the\r\nsociety was Michael O'Neill, the audit accountant of the company, and if\r\never a plain-spoken man, blunt and direct of speech existed, it was he.\r\nEvery word he spoke had the ring of honest sincerity.  To the men he\r\nspoke more plainly even than I, and him they never resented.  I think\r\ntheir trust in him exceeded their trust in me.  True he was Irish and I\r\nwas not, and then they had known him much longer than me; and so, small\r\nblame to them, said I.  One good thing for the society I managed to do.  I\r\ninduced the directors to treble the company's annual contribution to its\r\nfunds, a substantial benefit, of course, to the men.  I remained chairman\r\nof the society, and Michael O'Neill its deputy chairman till 1912, when\r\nthe National Insurance Act came into operation.  Then, by a resolution of\r\na majority of its members, it was wound up, to the regret, however, of\r\nmany of them, who preferred their own old institution which they knew so\r\nwell, and in the management of which they had a voice, to what some of\r\nthem styled \"a new-fangled thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe occasions on which I have met, for the first time, men eminent in the\r\nrailway world, and for whom I have had great admiration, have always left\r\nupon me very clear impressions, and this was particularly so in the case\r\nof Sir George Findlay, the General Manager of the London and\r\nNorth-Western Railway.  He was not, however, Sir George when I met him\r\nfirst, but plain Mr. Findlay.  It was in the year 1891, the occasion\r\nbeing one of the periodical visits to Ireland of the London and North-\r\nWestern chairman, directors, and principal officers.  They gave a dinner\r\nat their hotel in Dublin to which, with other Irish railway\r\nrepresentatives, I was invited.  My seat at dinner was next to Mr.\r\nFindlay, and I had much conversation with him.  Then in his sixty-third\r\nyear, he was, perhaps, interested in a young Englishman, 21 years his\r\njunior, who had not long begun his career as a railway manager, and who\r\nshowed some eagerness in, and, perhaps, a little knowledge of, railway\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nI remember well the impression he made upon me.  I felt I was in the\r\npresence of a strong, natural man, gifted with great discernment and\r\nability but full also of human kindness.  His face was one which\r\nexpressed that goodness which the consciousness of power imparts to\r\nstrong natures.  He was a notable as well as what is called \"a self-made\"\r\nman, a fact of which he never boasted but I think was a little proud.  He\r\ncommenced work at the early age of fourteen as a mason--a boy help he\r\ncould only have been--and continued a mason for several years.  He was\r\nemployed in the building of the new Houses of Parliament and much of the\r\nstone work and delicate tracery of the great window at the east end of\r\nWestminster Hall is the work of his hands.  In his twenty-third year he\r\nbecame manager of the Shrewsbury and Ludlow Railway--probably the\r\nyoungest railway manager recorded.  Ten years later the Shrewsbury\r\nrailway was acquired by the London and North-Western company, and\r\nFindlay, to use his own words, \"was taken over with the rest of the\r\nrolling stock.\"  This was how his London and North-Western railway career\r\nbegan.  He was a tall, portly man of fine presence, distinguished by a\r\nlarge measure of strong, plain, homely commonsense, an absence of\r\nprejudice, a great calmness of judgment, and a fearless frankness of\r\nspeech.  His sense of honour was very high, and he impressed upon the\r\nservice of which he was the executive head that the word of the London\r\nand North-Western Railway must always be its bond.  \"Be slow to promise\r\nand quick to perform,\" was his guiding precept.  A born organiser and\r\nadministrator, he knew how to select his men.  Before Parliamentary\r\nCommittees he was the best of witnesses, always cool and resourceful,\r\nwith great command of temper, full of knowledge, and blest with a ready\r\nwit.  His services as witness and expert adviser were in great request by\r\nrailway companies.  At the long Board of Trade Inquiry in connection with\r\nthe _Railway and Canal Traffic Act_ and Railway Rates and Charges, in\r\n1889, he was the principal railway witness and was under examination and\r\ncross-examination for eight consecutive days.  He had a real love for\r\nIreland, was partly Irish himself, his father being Scotch and his mother\r\nIrish--a fine blend.  Fishing was his chief recreation and this often\r\nbrought him to the lakes and rivers of Ireland.  He asked, was I the son\r\nof William Tatlow of the Midland Railway, whom he had met a good many\r\nyears before on some coal rates question?  On my saying, Yes, he was\r\npleased to know that I belonged to a railway family; and said what a fine\r\nservice the great railway service was, how absorbing the work and what\r\nscope it afforded for ambition and ability.  He asked about my railway\r\nexperience, was amused at my reason for leaving Derby and the Midland,\r\nand interested at hearing of my work with Mr. Wainwright, whom he had\r\nknown and esteemed.  He was sure I had learned nothing but good from him.\r\nI was able, and very glad, of course, to tell Mr. Findlay with what\r\ninterest Bailey and I had listened for several days to his evidence at\r\nWestminster Hall at the Railway Rates Inquiry, and how much we had\r\nprofited by it.  This led to some talk on the great rates question, of\r\nwhich he was a master.  I felt he was just a bit surprised to find that I\r\nwas rather well informed upon it, which made me not a little proud.\r\nAltogether it was a memorable night, and left me with a feeling of\r\nelation such as I had experienced in the meetings I had in Glasgow some\r\nyears before with Mr. John Burns and Mr. John Walker.  How little I\r\nthought then, that in less than two years I should follow Mr. Findlay's\r\nremains to the grave.\r\n\r\n[Sir George Findlay: findlay.jpg]\r\n\r\nBetween the London and North-Western and the Midland Great-Western much\r\ngood feeling existed.  They were natural allies, both greatly interested\r\nin the trade and prosperity of Ireland, and of the port of Dublin in\r\nparticular.  As time went on many matters of mutual interest brought me\r\ninto close relation with the North-Western general manager and other\r\nprominent officers of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nA RAILWAY CONTEST, THE PARCEL POST, AND THE BOARD OF TRADE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long-looked for fight in the Committee Rooms at Westminster came at\r\nlast, as most things that are eagerly looked and longed for do.  In May,\r\n1892, a Bill, promoted jointly by the Midland Great-Western and Athenry\r\nand Ennis Railway Companies, was considered by a Select Committee of the\r\nHouse of Lords.  It was a Bill for the acquisition by the Midland of the\r\nEnnis Railway (a line from Athenry to Ennis, 36 miles long), worked but\r\nnot owned by the Waterford and Limerick Railway Company.  The Midland\r\nwere anxious to buy and the Ennis were willing to sell, but Parliament\r\nalone could legalise the bargain.  To the Waterford and Limerick, the\r\nbare idea of giving up possession of the fair Ennis to their rival the\r\nMidland was gall and wormwood; and so they opposed the project with might\r\nand main, and they were assisted in their opposition by certain public\r\nbodies, some thought as much for the excitement of a skirmish in the\r\nCommittee Rooms as anything else.  The working agreement between the\r\nWaterford and Limerick and the Ennis Companies, which had lasted for ten\r\nyears or so, was expiring; the Ennis Company had grown tired of the\r\nunion; the Midland had held out to her certain glowing prospects, which\r\nhad captivated her maiden fancy, and so she was a consenting party to the\r\nMidland scheme.  The Ennis line, in the Midland eyes, was a prize worth\r\nfighting for, forming, as it did, part of a route from Dublin to Limerick\r\nin competition with the Great Southern and Western, a company between\r\nwhich and the Midland, at that time, little love was lost.  Those were\r\nthe days when competitive traffic, gained almost at any cost, was sweet\r\nas stolen kisses are said to be.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings opened on Monday, 16th May.  _Ennis_ was as familiar to\r\nthe Committee Rooms as the suit of _Jarndyce and Jarndyce_ was to the\r\nCourt of Chancery.  In 1880 the Midland had also sought by Bill to obtain\r\nthe fair Ennis (with her consent) but had failed; in 1890 the Waterford\r\nand Limerick (against her wishes) had essayed to do the same and failed\r\nalso, and in years long prior to these, other attempts had been made with\r\nthe like result.  But to proceed: our leading counsel were Sir Ralph\r\n(then Mr.) Littler; Mr. Pember, Mr. Pope and other leaders, and a host of\r\njuniors being arrayed against us.  The straitened circumstances of the\r\nWaterford and Limerick; its dearth of rolling stock; its inefficient\r\nways; its failure to satisfy the public; the admitted superiority of the\r\nMidland and all its works; the splendid results which would \"follow as\r\nthe night the day,\" if only Parliament would be wise enough to sanction a\r\nunion which the public interest demanded and commonsense approved--these\r\nwere the points on which our counsel exercised their forensic skill,\r\nexpended their eloquence, and to which they directed the evidence.\r\nAmongst our supporters we had some excellent witnesses, one, a well-known\r\ncattle dealer, named Martin Ryan.  The question of _running powers_ was\r\nprominent throughout the case and had been much debated and discussed.\r\nRyan's evidence was not, however, concerned with this, but in his cross-\r\nexamination, relative to something he had stated in his\r\nevidence-in-chief, he was asked this question: \"If a beast got on to the\r\nline as a train came along, what would happen to the beast?\"  \"It would\r\nexercise its running powers,\" answered Mr. Ryan, amidst great laughter.\r\nAs good as Stephenson's answer about the \"coo,\" said Mr. Pope.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day of the proceedings I made my _debut_ as a Parliamentary\r\nwitness.  In the preparation of my evidence I had expended much time and\r\ntrouble, keeping well in mind the way in which Mr. Wainwright used to\r\nprepare his.  Before my examination-in-chief concluded, a short\r\nadjournment for lunch took place--a scramble at the refreshment bars in\r\nthe lobbies, where wig and gown elbowed with all and sundry; where cold\r\nbeef, cold tongue, cold pie, and, coldest of all cold comestibles, cold\r\ncustard, were swallowed in hot haste, washed down with milk and soda, or\r\nperhaps with something stronger.  \"Quick lunches\" they were with a\r\nvengeance.  Time was money, and in the brief interval allowed, more than\r\nlunch had to be discussed.  Sir Ralph, Mr. Findlay (who was helping us)\r\nand I, had our hasty lunch together.  When it was over we discussed the\r\nmorning's proceedings, and Mr. Findlay, to my great satisfaction, said I\r\nwas doing well--very well indeed, for a first appearance.  Then, in a\r\nkind and fatherly way, he gave me some good advice: Don't show too much\r\neagerness, he said: don't go quite so much into detail; keep on broader\r\nlines; speak deliberately and very distinctly; make your points as plain\r\nas a pikestaff; rub them well in; don't try to make too many points, but\r\nstick fast to the important ones.  You've a good manner in the box, he\r\nsaid; remember these things and you'll make an excellent witness.  Then\r\nhe added: above all, whilst giving your leading evidence never forget the\r\n_cross_ that has to follow.  Be always as frank as you can, and never\r\nlose command of your temper.  These were not his very words.  I do not\r\npretend that he expressed himself with such sententious brevity, though\r\nhe never wasted speech, but they are the pith and marrow of his\r\nadmonitions.  For twenty years or so from then nearly every session saw\r\nme in the Committee Rooms, not always on the business of my own company,\r\nas other Irish railway companies on several occasions sought my help in\r\ntheir Parliamentary projects.  Mr. Findlay's advice I never forgot.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon my cross-examination began.  The final question put to\r\nme by our counsel was: \"Lastly, if this amalgamation is carried out, do\r\nyou think the public would be served by it, and if so, how?\"  This\r\nappeared to me a great chance for a little speech, so I summed up as\r\nforcibly and graphically as I could all the advantages that would follow\r\nif the Bill were passed.  Then my cross-examination commenced, and the\r\nfirst words addressed to me, by Mr. Pembroke Stephens, were: \"I do not\r\nthink that one could have made a better speech oneself, if one had been\r\non your side.\"  \"Not half so good,\" said Mr. Littler in a stage whisper.\r\nI thought Mr. Stephens spoke satirically, but remembered Mr. Findlay's\r\nadvice, and if I flushed inwardly, as I believe I did, no outward sign\r\nescaped me.  After Mr. Stephens, three other opposing counsel fired their\r\nguns, but I withstood their shot and shell, and when I came out of the\r\nbox Mr. Findlay said I had done well.  This was praise enough for me.\r\nThen he gave his evidence in his usual masterly convincing way and I\r\nlistened in admiration.\r\n\r\nWe made a good fight I know, the odds were in our favour and success\r\nseemed assured.  Our opponents then presented their case, and still we\r\nfelt no doubt; but Fortune is a fickle jade and at the last she left us\r\nin the lurch.  On the eighth day of the proceedings the Chairman\r\nannounced: \"The Committee are of opinion that it is not expedient to\r\nproceed with the Bill.\"  This was the _coup de grace_.  No reasons are\r\never given by a Committee for their decision and the contending parties\r\nare left to imagine them.  The losing side sometimes has the hardihood to\r\nthink a decision is wrong.  I believe we thought so; and I know that\r\n_Ennis_, who was thus doomed to a further period of single blessedness,\r\nthought the same.\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter I have spoken of the _Parcel Post Act_ of 1882, and\r\nmentioned the share of the receipts apportioned to the railway companies\r\nof the United Kingdom.  The Act also prescribed the manner in which this\r\nshare was to be divided amongst the respective railways.  When it was\r\ndevised the method seemed fair to all, and had the consent of all.  But\r\nthe best of theories do not always stand the test of practice and so it\r\nwas found in this case.  It did not suit Ireland.  We discovered that the\r\nIrish railways were, in equity, entitled to more than the scheme awarded\r\nthem, and Mr. Alcorn, the Accountant of the Great Southern and Western\r\nRailway, discovered the way to set the matter right; but it could not be\r\nrighted without the consent of the Parcel Post Conference, a body which\r\nsat at the Railway Clearing House in London, and was composed of the\r\nmanagers of all the railways parties to the parcel post scheme, some\r\neighty or so in number.  On the 10th November, 1892, we brought our case\r\nbefore that body, and Colhoun, Robertson and I were the spokesmen for the\r\nIrish Railways.  On the previous day we had met Sir George Findlay (he\r\nhad been knighted this year) and had satisfied him of the justice of our\r\nclaim.  He promised to support us.  The meeting commenced at 10 o'clock.\r\nWe made our speeches, which were not long, for our printed statement had\r\nbeen in each member's hands for some time.  Clear as our case was to us\r\nthe Conference seemed unconvinced, and we began to fear an adverse vote.\r\nSir George was not present, something had happened, for he was not the\r\nman to disappoint his friends without grave cause.  Voting seemed\r\nimminent.  Robertson whispered to me, \"For heaven's sake, Tatlow, get on\r\nyour legs again and keep the thing going; Findlay may be here any\r\nmoment.\"  I was supposed to be the glibbest of speech of our party, and\r\nup I got.  But Mr. Thompson (afterwards Sir James), the _beau_, was in\r\nthe chair, and thought there had been talking enough.  However, like the\r\nIrishman I was not, I went on, and--at that moment entered Sir George!\r\nThe scene was changed; the day was won!  A Sub-Committee of seven, three\r\nof whom were Colhoun, Robertson and myself, was appointed to follow up\r\nthe matter, and ultimately the Irish proposal was adopted.\r\n\r\nIt was a very busy period, this year of 1892, and as interesting as busy.\r\nOn the 20th June the _Railway Rates and Charges (Athenry and Ennis\r\nJunction Railways) Order Confirmation Act_, 1892, received the Royal\r\nAssent.  It applied to all the railways in Ireland and contained the\r\nRevised Classification and Maximum Rates and Charges settled after long\r\ninquiries under the _Railway and Canal Traffic Act_, 1888, and which were\r\nto control the future rates to be charged by the companies.  Only six\r\nmonths were allowed in which to revise all rates and bring them into\r\nconformity with the new classification and the new conditions--an\r\nabsurdly short time, for the work involved was colossal.  But it had to\r\nbe done.  Robert Morrison, Michael O'Neill and I, took off our coats and\r\nworked night and day.  We had the satisfaction of accomplishing the task\r\nin the allotted time, which not every company was able to do.  Generous,\r\nas always, Sir Ralph in his speech to the shareholders in February, 1893,\r\nsaid: \"I wish to express that we are greatly indebted to Mr. Tatlow for\r\nthe care and anxiety with which he has endeavoured to arrange this\r\nimportant rates matter.  He has worked most energetically; has attended\r\nthe Committees of the Board of Trade, and the Parliamentary Committee,\r\nand he is now seeing traders constantly.  I may tell you that I and my\r\nbrother directors place the most implicit reliance on our manager, and I\r\nam satisfied that anything he has done has been reasonable to the traders\r\nand for the benefit of the shareholders.\"  This was warm praise, and the\r\nmore welcome, being, as it was, the spontaneous expression of what I knew\r\nhe felt.\r\n\r\nMy meetings with the traders usually, but not invariably, resulted in\r\nfriendly settlements.  The great firm of Guinness and Company were not so\r\neasily satisfied, and offered a _stout_ resistance which correspondence\r\nand conference failed to overcome.  Under the Railway and Canal Traffic\r\nAct a mode of dealing with the _impasse_ was provided by conciliation\r\nproceedings presided over by the Board of Trade.  This we took advantage\r\nof, and after several meetings in London a compromise was effected.  It\r\nwas then that I met for the first time Mr. Francis Hopwood, who had just\r\nbeen appointed Secretary to the Railway Department of the Board of Trade.\r\nI liked his way and thought that conciliation could not be in better\r\nhands than his.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade is more or less a mythical body, but very practical I\r\nfound it on these and all other occasions.  Its proper designation is, I\r\nbelieve, \"Committee of Privy Council for Trade.\"  This Committee was\r\nfirst appointed in Cromwell's time, and was revised under Charles II., as\r\n\"Committee of Privy Council for Trade and Foreign Plantations,\" under\r\nwhich title it administered the Colonies.  When the United States became\r\nindependent, Burke in a scathing speech, moved and carried the abolition\r\nof this paid Committee, which included Gibbon as its Secretary.  However,\r\nthe Board of Trade could not be spared, and so it was restored by Order\r\nin Council in 1786.  Under that order the principal officers of State,\r\nand certain members of the Privy Council, including the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, have, _ex officio_, seats on the Committee, although no\r\nrecord exists of His Grace having ever left his arduous duties at Lambeth\r\nto attend the Committee.  Its jurisdiction extended as trade and commerce\r\ndeveloped and railways appeared on the scene, and gradually it was\r\ndivided into departments, and so the _Board of Trade_ came into being.\r\nLike Topsy it \"grow'd.\"  The Board of Trade is, in fact, a mere name, the\r\npresident being practically the secretary for trade, the vice-president\r\nhaving, for 50 years past, been a Parliamentary secretary with duties\r\nsimilar to those of an under-secretary of State.  At present, besides the\r\npresident (who has usually a seat in the Cabinet), the Parliamentary\r\nsecretary and a permanent secretary, there are six assistant secretaries\r\n(in late war time many more), each in charge of a department.\r\n\r\nIn charge of the railway department in 1893 was, as I have said, Mr.\r\nFrancis Hopwood.  He became Sir Francis in 1906, and from then onwards\r\nadvanced from office to office and from honour to honour, until, during\r\nhis secretaryship of the Irish Convention in 1917, his public services\r\nwere rewarded with a peerage.  As railway secretary of the Board of Trade\r\nhe was particularly distinguished for tact, strength and moderation.\r\nSingularly courteous and obliging on all occasions, I, personally, have\r\nbeen much indebted to him for help and advice.\r\n\r\nBut all was not sunshine and happiness in this busy year of 1892.  A dark\r\ncloud of sorrow overshadowed it.  On a fateful day in January I lost,\r\nwith tragic suddenness, the younger of my two sons, a bright amiable boy,\r\nof a sunny nature and gentle disposition.  He was accidentally killed on\r\nthe railway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nTHE \"RAILWAY NEWS,\" THE INTERNATIONAL RAILWAY CONGRESS, AND A TRIP TO\r\nSPAIN AND PORTUGAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XX I recorded the death of my old friend W. F. Mills, which\r\ntook place whilst I was writing that chapter.  Now, as I pen these lines,\r\nI hear of the loss of another old familiar railway friend; not indeed a\r\nsentient being like you, dear reader, or him or me, yet a friend that\r\nlacked neither perception nor feeling.\r\n\r\nThe _Railway News_ on Saturday, the 30th day of November, 1918, issued\r\nits last number, and, as a separate entity, ceased to be, its existence\r\nthen merging into that of the _Railway Gazette_.  I am sad and sorry for\r\nI knew it well.  For forty years it was my week-end companion; for ten\r\nyears or more, in the April of life, I contributed regularly to its\r\npages; and never, during all the years, have its columns been closed to\r\nmy pen.  One of its editors, F. McDermott, has long been my friend, and\r\nits first editor, Edward McDermott, his father, a grand old man, was kind\r\nto me in my salad days and encouraged my budding scribbling proclivities.\r\nHe and Samuel Smiles, the author of _Self Help_ (then Secretary of the\r\nSouth Eastern Railway), were, in 1864, its joint founders.\r\n\r\n\"Death,\" the Psalmist saith, \"is certain to all.\"  In 1893, the railway\r\nworld lost one whom it could ill spare.  In the month of March, after a\r\nshort illness, Sir George Findlay died at the early age of 63.  Gifted of\r\nthe gods, in the midst of his work, young in mind and spirit, his\r\nfaculties in full vigour, he was suddenly called away.  His funeral, I\r\nneed not say, was attended by railway men from all parts of the kingdom.\r\nI was one of those who travelled to London to follow his remains to their\r\nresting place.\r\n\r\nFurther public railway legislation was enacted in 1893 and 1894, and four\r\nimportant Acts were passed.  The first was the _Railway Regulation Act_,\r\n1893.  It dealt with the hours of labour of railway servants, a subject\r\nwhich for some time previously had been enjoying the attention of the\r\nPress.  It culminated in the appointment of a Parliamentary Committee.  In\r\nFebruary, 1891, a Select Committee, consisting of 24 members, with Sir\r\nMichael Hicks Beach as chairman, was formed, \"To inquire whether, and if\r\nso, in what way, the hours of railway servants should be restricted by\r\nlegislation.\"  The Committee examined numerous railway servants and\r\nofficials, and reported to Parliament, in June, 1892.  I was summoned by\r\nthe Committee to give evidence and appeared before them in London on 24th\r\nMarch of that year.  My business was to furnish facts concerning the\r\nhours of duty of the employees on my own railway and the conditions of\r\ntheir work.  This I did pretty fully and embraced the opportunity of\r\nshowing how different were the circumstances of Irish railways compared\r\nwith English, and how legislation suitable to one country might be very\r\nunsuitable to the other.  It scarcely needed saying that England was an\r\nindustrial country whilst Ireland was agricultural; that England, with\r\n620 people to the square mile, was thickly populated and Ireland with 135\r\nsparsely; that population meant trains and traffic; that in England\r\nrailway traffic amounted to about 7,000 pounds per mile per annum and in\r\nIreland a little over 1,000 pounds; that in Ireland on many lines not\r\nmore than five or six trains ran each way daily, and on others only three\r\nor four, whilst in England, on most lines, the _hourly_ number exceeded\r\nthese.  When the Committee rose Sir Michael engaged me, informally, in\r\nconversation for a little while.  He was curious concerning some of the\r\nfacts I had adduced, particularly as to the Midland line and the country\r\nit served.\r\n\r\nIn their report the Committee stated they had confined their inquiry to\r\nthe hours of duty of those classes of railway servants that were engaged\r\nin working traffic, viz., drivers, firemen, guards, signalmen, shunters,\r\nplatelayers and porters, and had not dealt with other classes; a wise\r\ndistinction I thought.  It was much easier, they said, to regulate the\r\nhours of persons occupying fixed posts of duty within reasonable limits,\r\nthan those of the running staff on railways, on account of the variety in\r\nthe nature of the work.  They reported also that they were unable to\r\nrecommend a \"legal day,\" as they considered it would be found\r\nimpracticable owing to the number of cases which must necessarily be\r\nadmitted as exceptions to any fixed limit of hours, adding that the hours\r\nof railway servants engaged in working traffic cannot be regulated like\r\nthose in a factory, which, I may add, experience has abundantly shown.  I\r\nbelieve, and have always believed, in reasonable working hours, and have\r\noften worked unreasonably long hours myself in endeavouring to arrange\r\nthem for others; and more than once when I have re-arranged a rota for\r\ndrivers, firemen and guards, to my own satisfaction, I have been begged\r\nby the men concerned not to make any change and to let well alone; not,\r\nof course, because the new rota gave shorter hours, but because it\r\nprevented the men from getting to their homes or interfered with\r\nsomething else that suited them.  Sometimes I gave way to the men and\r\nsometimes I stuck to my revised rota.  Every case varied and required\r\nspecial consideration.  The Committee also said: \"It is universally\r\nadmitted that the railway service is very popular under existing\r\nconditions; and several railway servants who appeared as witnesses\r\nprotested vigorously against any interference by Government or the\r\nLegislature.\"  State interference, I know, is the fashion now; but the\r\nblind worship of _any fashion_ is but weakness and folly.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1893 was the outcome of the Report.  It provided that on\r\nrepresentation being made to the Board of Trade that the hours of any\r\nrailway servants were excessive, the Board might inquire into the\r\ncomplaint, and order the company concerned to submit an amended schedule\r\nof time and duty for such servants, and if the railway company failed to\r\ncomply with the order the matter might then be referred to the Railway\r\nCommisioners whose order the company must obey under a penalty of 100\r\npounds a day.  I do not think any company was ever fined; nor do I,\r\nindeed, remember the Commissioners services being required.  If they\r\nwere, the occasions were few and far between, as the companies generally\r\nloyally carried out the provisions of the Act.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 was passed the _Notice of Accidents Act_.  Where any person\r\nemployed in the construction, use, working or repair of any railway,\r\ntramroad, tramway, gas works, canal bridge, tunnel, harbour, dock or\r\nother work authorised by Parliament, suffered (it said) an accident\r\ncausing loss of life or bodily injury, the employer must notify the Board\r\nof Trade, and if the Board of Trade considered the case of sufficient\r\nimportance, they may (it provided) direct the holding of a formal\r\ninquiry; a report of such inquiry to be presented to the Board of Trade,\r\nwhich may (it stated) be made public in such manner as they think fit.  As\r\nfar as accidents to railway servants were concerned, I can vouch that\r\nthese inquiries were pretty often held, and the companies, concerned\r\nalways for the safety of their employees, never did other than welcome\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe _Railway and Canal Traffic Act_, 1894, was an Act to _amend_ (save\r\nthe mark!) _The Railway and Canal Traffic Act_, 1888.  Its effect, in\r\nfact, was to embitter instead of amend.  It was, as I have previously\r\nindicated, panic legislation yielded in haste to unreasonable clamour,\r\nunfair to the railways, and of doubtful advantage to traders.  I will say\r\nno more lest I say too much.\r\n\r\nThe fourth of these enactments was the _Diseases of Animals Act_, 1894.\r\nIt invested the Board of Agriculture with further powers to make orders\r\nand regulations respecting animals affected with pleuro-pneumonia or foot-\r\nand-mouth disease, particularly with regard to markets, fairs, transit\r\nand slaughter houses; for securing the providing of water and food; and\r\nfor cleansing and disinfecting vessels, vehicles and pens.  As regards\r\nIreland the powers were vested in the Lord Lieutenant and Privy Council,\r\nand on the establishment of the Department of Agriculture for Ireland, in\r\nthe year 1899, were transferred to that body.\r\n\r\nThe International Railway Congress Association is an interesting if not\r\nan ancient body.  It dates back to the year 1885.  Gallant little Belgium\r\nwas its parent.  In 1885, the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of the\r\nfirst public railway on the Continent of Europe (the line between\r\nBrussels and Malines) was celebrated at Brussels by a Congress convened\r\non the invitation of the Belgian Government, and this meeting was the\r\nbeginning of the now worldwide association.  At the first assembly at\r\nBrussels \"the study of technical and administrative questions for\r\nrailways\" was the avowed object in view; and it has been the serious\r\npurpose of every Congress since.  But gradually pleasant relaxations,\r\nsuch as lunches, dinners, dances and excursions, for wives and daughters\r\naccompanying husbands and fathers graced these gatherings of railway\r\nwisdom.  During the first ten years the sessions were bi-annual, but\r\nsince 1895 have been held every five years.  Brussels, Milan, Paris, St.\r\nPetersburg, London, Washington and Berne have each been the scene of\r\ntheir celebration, and Paris has been favoured twice.  For 1915 Berlin\r\nwas the capital selected, but the war decided against that; and when\r\nBerlin shall see the world's railway representatives assembled within her\r\ngates only a very bold man will venture to prophesy.\r\n\r\nThe Congress is composed of some 420 railway systems represented by\r\nnearly 1,500 delegates; and any railway company, the wide world over,\r\nthat possesses a mileage of 62 miles or more is competent for membership.\r\nIn addition to holding Sessions the Congress publishes a monthly Bulletin\r\n(or did prior to the war), containing, besides original articles on all\r\nquestions relating to the construction, operation, and organisation of\r\nrailways, reproductions of interesting articles published in the railway\r\nand engineering papers of any nation, as well as notices of books and\r\npamphlets on railway questions.  The Bulletin contains also all reports\r\nprepared for the various Sessions of the Congress and minutes of the\r\ndiscussions.  It was a great gathering that the late King Edward (then\r\nPrince of Wales) opened on June the 26th, 1895, when the Congress was in\r\nLondon.  The scene was the Imperial Institute, and the meetings lasted\r\ntill July the 9th.  From all parts of the globe delegates came.  All was\r\nnot dull routine for British hospitality abounded and the companies vied\r\nwith each other in worthy entertainments, and Her Majesty the Queen saw\r\nfit to signalise the occasion by giving a garden party in its honour.\r\n\r\nMr. W. M. Acworth, the well-known writer on railway economics, and a keen\r\nbut friendly critic of railway affairs, was appointed Secretary to the\r\nEnglish Section of the Congress, and to him fell the principal work\r\nconnected with the Session.  His scholarly and linguistic attainments and\r\nhis varied travels, fitted him well for the task.  My eldest son, then a\r\nyouth of 18, just entered the railway service, had the good fortune to be\r\nselected as one of Mr. Acworth's assistants.  He had not long finished\r\nhis education in France, and spoke the language fluently, which, of\r\ncourse, was a recommendation.  It was valuable experience to him as well\r\nas delightful work.  He conducted several parties of delegates through\r\nvarious parts of England and Ireland in connection with the many\r\nexcursions that were arranged for their pleasure and profit.  The weather\r\nwas very hot, and railway travelling at times oppressive, even to\r\ndelegates from the sunny land of France, and _shandy-gaff_, a beverage\r\nnew to most of the visitors, was in great request.  Said a French\r\ndelegate one day to my son, as the train was approaching Rugby: \"Oh!\r\nM'sieu Tatlow, the weather it is so hot; will you not at Rugby give us\r\nsome of your beautiful _char-a-banc_?\"  On another occasion he was asked\r\nif he would \"be so kind as to give the _recipe_ for making that beautiful\r\ntoast.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the session in London, a number of the foreign delegates,\r\nat the invitation of the Irish Railway Companies, visited Ireland, and\r\nwere shown its railways, and its beauty spots from east to west, from\r\nnorth to south.  It is not too much to say they were greatly impressed.\r\nThe splendid scenery that surrounds the island like a beautiful frame,\r\ndelighted them, and the excellence of the Irish railways was no little\r\nsurprise.  They did not expect to see such fine carriages, such handsome\r\ndining saloons, nor such permanent way and stations.  Of course we showed\r\nthem our best and the best was very good.  Ireland is often accused of\r\nneglecting her opportunities, but never her hospitality.  On this\r\noccasion, personified by her railway companies, she neglected neither,\r\nand in the latter surpassed herself.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of this year I was able to gratify my taste for travel by a\r\nlonger excursion than usual.  Hitherto my furthest flights had been to\r\nParis, Belgium, and Holland, but now I went as far as Spain and Portugal.\r\nF. K. was my pleasant companion and we travelled, _via_ Paris, straight\r\nthrough to Madrid, where we stayed for a week at the Hotel de la Paix, in\r\nthe bright and busy and sunny Puerto del Sol.  In Madrid we visited the\r\nRoyal Palace (or so much of it as was shown to the public--principally\r\nthe Royal stables); the Escurial; the Art Galleries and Museums; drove in\r\nthe Buen Retiro; witnessed a bull fight, which rather sickened us when\r\nthe horses, which never stood a chance in the contest, were ripped up by\r\nthe bull; admired dark-eyed senoritas, their mantillas and coquettish\r\nfans, enjoyed the southern sunshine and the Spanish wines; and then left\r\nfor Lisbon by an _express_ train that stopped at nearly every station.  At\r\nLisbon three or four days were pleasantly passed, though we were annoyed\r\nsometimes by the crowd of persistent beggars that thronged the streets,\r\nand who, we were told, pursued their calling by license from the\r\nauthorities.  This was a small matter, however.  He who travels should be\r\nproof against such minor annoyances.  Then Oporto was visited, and the\r\nDouro valley, the very centre of the port wine industry.  A young\r\nEnglishman, a wine merchant, accompanied us in our journey through this\r\nsultry valley and was our cicerone.  Under his guidance we visited many\r\nfamous \"wine lodges,\" sampled wonderful vintages in most generous\r\nglasses, drank old port, green port, tawny port, and I am sure too much\r\nport, and when, at last, we reached the port of Biarritz, where we stayed\r\nfor several days, we blessed its lighter wines and refreshing breezes.\r\nAfter Biarritz Bordeaux detained us for a day or two, and so did Paris,\r\nwhich we found very attractive and refreshing in early November.\r\n\r\nThis year also had for me a delightful week's interlude, in the month of\r\nJune, in the Committee Rooms at Westminster.  A certain Bill was promoted\r\nby an Irish railway company, which we considered an aggressive attempt to\r\ninvade our territory, and, of course, we vigorously opposed it.  Again I\r\nhad the pleasure of giving evidence and of being crossed-examined by Mr.\r\nPembroke Stephens; but the Bill was passed and became an Act.  Further\r\nsign of vitality it never showed as the line was never made.  It is one\r\nthing, by the grace of Parliament to obtain an Act, but quite another by\r\nthe favour of the public to obtain capital.  Parliament is often more\r\neasily persuaded than the shrewd investor, as many a too sanguine\r\npromoter knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nTOM ROBERTSON, MORE ABOUT LIGHT RAILWAYS, AND THE INLAND TRANSIT OF\r\nCATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nBy his friends and intimates he was called _Tom_, and mere acquaintances\r\neven usually spoke of him as _Tom Robertson_.  Rarely was he designated\r\n_Thomas_.  A man who is known so familiarly is generally a good fellow,\r\nand Tom Robertson was no exception, though he possessed some pretty\r\nstrong qualities, and was particularly fond of getting his own way.\r\n\r\nIn his early days at the Great Northern, sundry skirmishes at the\r\nClearing House had taken place between him and me, which for a time\r\nproduced a certain amount of estrangement, but we afterwards became\r\nexcellent friends and saw a good deal of each other.  He was no longer a\r\n_general manager_, having given up that post for another which was\r\npressed upon him--the post of Chairman of the Irish Board of Works.  It\r\nwas certainly unusual, unheard of one might say, in those days, for an\r\nimportant government office to be conferred upon a railway official,\r\nthough now it would excite but little surprise.  The Government it was\r\nthought contemplated something in the shape of a railway policy in\r\nIreland, and had spotted Robertson as the man for the job; it was\r\ncertainly said that someone in high authority, taken greatly by his\r\nsturdy independence, his unconventional ways, and his enormous energy,\r\nhad determined to try the novel experiment which such an appointment\r\nmeant.  I do not think that Robertson himself ever really enjoyed the\r\nchange.  He liked variety it is true, but governmental ways were not, he\r\noften said, his ways, and he seemed to lack the capacity to easily adapt\r\nhimself to new grooves.  Unconventional he certainly was, and never in\r\nLondon even would he wear a tall hat or a tail coat; nor could he ever be\r\npersuaded to attend a levee or any State function whatever.  He usually\r\ndressed in roughish tweeds, with trousers unfashionably wide, and a\r\nflaming necktie competing with his bright red cheeks, which contrasted\r\nstrongly with his dark hair and beard.  He was, however, a strong manly\r\nfellow, with a great deal of determination mingled with good humour.\r\nUsually in high spirits, he often displayed a boyish playfulness that\r\nresembled the gambols of a big good-natured dog.  He was musical too, and\r\nwould sing _Annie Laurie_ for you at any time, accompanying himself on\r\nthe piano.  To practical joking he was rather addicted, and once I was\r\nhis reluctant accomplice, but am glad to say it was the last time I ever\r\nengaged in such rude pleasantry.  I can write of him now the more freely\r\nthat he is no longer of this world.  Excessive energy hastened his death.\r\nIn 1901 he went to India to investigate for the Government the railways\r\nthere, and to report upon them.  It was a big task, occupied him a long\r\ntime, and I am told he worked and lived there as though he were in his\r\nnative temperate zone.  His restless energy was due I should say to\r\nsuperabundant vitality.  Once, when he and I were in London together, on\r\nsome railway business, we took a stroll after dinner (it was summertime)\r\nand during a pause in our conversation he surprised me by exclaiming:\r\n\"Tatlow, I'm a restless beggar.  I'd like to have a jolly good row with\r\nsomebody.\"  \"Get married,\" said I.  This tickled him greatly and restored\r\nhis good humour.  He lived and died a bachelor nevertheless.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the _Railways (Ireland) Act_ was passed, and with it Robertson\r\nhad much to do.  Its purpose ran: \"To facilitate the construction of\r\nRailways and the Establishment of other means of Communication in\r\nIreland, and for other purposes incidental thereto.\"  It provided for\r\nfurther advances by the Treasury, under prescribed conditions, for\r\nconstructing railways and for establishing lines of steamers, coaches,\r\netc., which were shown to be necessary for the development of the\r\nresources of any district, where owing to the circumstances of such\r\ndistrict, they could not be made without government assistance.  It also\r\nauthorised the construction and maintenance, as part of such railways, of\r\nany pier, quay or jetty.  This little Act, which consisted of thirteen\r\nsections (I wonder he did not think the number unlucky), was Robertson's\r\nparticular pet.  Concerning its clauses, from the time they were first\r\ndrafted, many a talk we had together over a cup of tea with, to use his\r\nown expression, \"a wee drappie in't.\"  I may have hinted as much, but do\r\nnot think I have mentioned before that he was a Scotchman and a\r\nHighlander.\r\n\r\nIn the same year was passed the _Light Railways Act_, an Act which\r\napplied to Great Britain only.  Ireland had already had her share (some\r\nthought more than her share) of light railway legislation, with its\r\naccompanying doles in the shape of easy loans and free gifts, whilst\r\nEngland and Scotland had been left in the cold.  It was their turn now;\r\nbut as this Act, and the subject of light railways generally, formed the\r\nsubstance of a paper which I prepared and read in 1900 before the\r\nInternational Railway Congress at Paris, and of which I shall speak later\r\non, I will pass it now without more comment.\r\n\r\nAt Robertson's request I appeared as a witness this year for the Great\r\nNorthern Railway, before Committees of both Houses of Parliament, in\r\nconnection with a Bill which sought powers to construct an extension of\r\nthe Donegal railway from Strabane to Londonderry.  Robertson himself did\r\nnot give evidence in the case.  Before the Committees sat he had left the\r\nGreat Northern for the Board of Works, and Henry Plews, his successor,\r\nrepresented the Great Northern Railway.  The proposed line was in direct\r\ncompetition with the Great Northern, and they sought my aid in opposing\r\nit.  Certainly there was no need for two railways, but Parliament thought\r\notherwise and passed the Bill.  Indeed Parliament is not free from blame\r\nfor many unnecessary duplicated lines throughout the kingdom.\r\n_Competition_ was for long its fetish; now it is _unification_, and\r\n(blessed word!) _co-ordination_.  Strange how men are taken with fine\r\nwords and phrases, and what slaves they are to shibboleths!  Before the\r\nHouse of Commons Committee which sat on this Bill I had the pleasure, for\r\nthe first time, of being examined by Balfour Browne.  He was leader in\r\nthe case for the Great Northern, and I met him also in consultations\r\nwhich took place.  Since then I have crossed swords with him too, and\r\nalways I must confess with keen enjoyment.  His knowledge of railway\r\nmatters was so remarkable, his mind so practiced, alert, and luminous,\r\nthat it was rare excitement to undergo cross-examination at his hands.  In\r\nhis book, _Forty Years at the Bar_, he himself says: \"I have not had many\r\nopportunities of giving evidence, but I confess that when I have been\r\ncalled as a witness I have enjoyed myself.\"  Well, I can say that I have\r\nhad many such opportunities, and can truthfully declare that I have\r\nenjoyed them all.\r\n\r\nA few weeks holiday in Holland, Cologne, the Rhine and Frankfort, with\r\nsome days on the homeward journey in Brussels, all in company of my dear\r\ndelightful friend, Walter Bailey, complete the annals of this year,\r\nexcept that I recall a little arbitration case in which I was engaged.  It\r\nwas during the summer, in July I think.  The Grand Canal (not the canal\r\nwhich belongs to the Midland and is called the Royal) is a waterway which\r\ntraverses 340 miles of country.  Not that it is all canal proper, some of\r\nit being canalised river and loughs; but 154 miles are canal pure and\r\nsimple, the undisputed property of the Grand Canal Company.  On a part of\r\nthe river Barrow which is canalised, an accident happened, and a trader's\r\nbarge was sunk and goods seriously damaged.  Dispute arose as to\r\nliability, and I was called on to arbitrate.  To view the scene of the\r\ndisaster was a pleasant necessity, and the then manager of the company\r\n(Mr. Kirkland) suggested making a sort of picnic of the occasion; so one\r\nmorning we left the train at Carlow, from whence a good stout horse\r\ntowed, at a steady trot, a comfortable boat for twenty miles or so to the\r\n_locus_ of the accident.  We were a party of four, not to mention the\r\nhamper.  It was delightfully wooded scenery through which we passed, and\r\na snug little spot where we lunched.  After lunch and the arbitration\r\nproceedings had been despatched, our Pegasus towed us back.\r\n\r\nI must return again to Robertson, the Board of Works, and light railways.\r\nPreliminary to the authorisation of light railways in Ireland, the\r\nlegislation which had been passed concerning them required that the Board\r\nof Works should appoint fit and proper persons to make public inquiry\r\nregarding the merits of proposed lines, as to engineering, finance,\r\nconstruction, the favour or objection with which they were regarded by\r\nlandowners and others, the amount of capital required, the assistance\r\nthat would be given by landowners, local authorities and others towards\r\ntheir construction, and their merit generally from all points of view;\r\nsuch fit persons after they had done all this, to report to the Board of\r\nWorks.  In 1897 Robertson thought that \"Joseph Tatlow of Dublin, and\r\nWilliam Roberts of Inverness, were fit and proper persons\" for conducting\r\nthe necessary inquiry concerning a proposed light railway in north-west\r\nDonegal, from Letterkenny to Burtonport, a distance of 50 miles.  William\r\nRoberts was the Engineer of the Highland Railway of Scotland, a capable,\r\nenergetic, practical man, and a canny Scot.  This line was promoted by\r\nthe Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company.  Roberts and I gladly\r\nundertook the work.  We held public meetings, which were largely attended\r\n(for it was an event in Donegal) in Letterkenny, Falcarragh and\r\nBurtonport, examined nearly fifty witnesses, and heard a great variety of\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nBut the hearing of evidence was by no means all we did.  It was our duty\r\nto examine the route, and determine if it were the best practicable route\r\n(keeping steadily in view that the available funds were limited in\r\namount), scrutinise and criticise the estimates, consider the stations to\r\nbe provided, inquire as to the probable traffic and working expenses, and\r\ninform ourselves thoroughly on all the aspects and merits of the case.  We\r\ndrove some 240 miles, not of course by motor car (motors were not common\r\nthen) but with stout Irish horses, and inspected the country well.  After\r\nwe presented our report, certain procedure followed; the Baronies\r\nguaranteed interest on 5,000 pounds of the capital; the government gave\r\nthe rest (some 313,000 pounds) as a free grant; an Order in Council was\r\npassed, and the line was made and opened for traffic in 1903.  It has\r\nmore than verified all predictions as to its usefulness, and has proved a\r\nblessing to north-west Donegal.  My relations with the line by no means\r\nended with the inquiry, and more about it will later on appear in this\r\nauthentic history.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1897, with G. P. Culverwell, the engineer of my old\r\nrailway, the Belfast and County Down, as co-adjutor, I was entrusted by\r\nRobertson with a similar inquiry concerning the Buncrana to Carndonagh\r\nline (18 miles in length) also in Donegal, and also promoted by the\r\nLondonderry and Lough Swilly Company.  It was a smaller affair than the\r\nBurtonport line, but involved similar pleasant and interesting work.  This\r\nline was also constructed and was opened in 1901.\r\n\r\nPleasant times, Joseph Tatlow, you seem to have had, and much variety and\r\ndiversion; but what of your own railway and your duties to it?  Well,\r\nthese Parliamentary proceedings, arbitration cases, and light railway\r\nadventures were, after all, only interludes, and I can conscientiously\r\nsay that the Midland line and its needs and interests were never\r\nneglected.  I am one of those who always believed that everything which\r\nserved to enlarge experience and mature judgment made a man more\r\ncompetent for his daily work.\r\n\r\nIn July a Departmental Committee was appointed by the Board of\r\nAgriculture \"To inquire into and Report upon the Inland Transit of\r\nCattle.\"  The Committee numbered ten, Sir Wm. Hart Dyke, M.P., being\r\nchairman.  Three other M.P.s were members of the Committee, one being\r\nthat redoubtable champion of the cattle trade and chairman of the Irish\r\nCattle Trades Association, Mr. William Field.  Two railway\r\nrepresentatives were amongst the ten, one of them, Sir William Birt,\r\ngeneral manager of the Great Eastern Railway; the other the Honourable\r\nRichard Nugent, a director of the Midland Great Western Railway, the\r\nlatter having considerable experience of the cattle trade and of cattle\r\ntransit in Ireland.  He was no bad judge himself of a beast.  He farmed\r\nin County Galway, and farming in the west of Ireland meant the raising of\r\ncattle, though nowadays some tillage is also done.  He loved attending\r\ncattle fairs, and more than once turned me out of bed before the break of\r\nday to accompany him to a fair green, much to my discomfiture; but so\r\ngreat was _his_ enjoyment, and so pleasant and lively his company that I\r\nbelieve I thanked him on each occasion for bringing me out.\r\n\r\nSir William Hart Dyke did not act as chairman of the Committee; in fact\r\nhe was prevented by illness from attending any meeting after the first,\r\nand in his absence the chair was taken by Mr. Parker Smith, M.P.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the inquiry included Great Britain and Ireland; but, as the\r\nCommittee stated in their report, \"In Ireland the proportional importance\r\nof the cattle trade is much the greater,\" and that no doubt was why they\r\nexamined in Dublin 42 witnesses against about half that number in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nPlews, Colhoun and I gave evidence for the Irish railways, supplemented\r\nwith testimony on matters of detail by some of our subordinates.  My\r\nrailway (the Midland) being, relatively at any rate, the principal cattle-\r\ncarrying line in Ireland, it was agreed that I should give the greater\r\npart of the evidence and appear first.  The railway companies, of course,\r\ncame on after the public witnesses had had their say.\r\n\r\nThe Committee in their report made some useful recommendations both for\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland, not only in regard to the transit of cattle by\r\nrailway, but also in reference to public supervision at fairs;\r\naccommodation and inspection at ports; the licensing of drovers;\r\ndishorning of young cattle, etc.  With respect to railway transit the\r\nrecommendations were directed principally to control and accommodation at\r\nstations; pens and loading banks; improvement in cattle trucks; and rest,\r\nfood and water.\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to the railway companies to say that for some years\r\nprevious to the inquiry they had been making constant and steady\r\nimprovements in these matters, and I believe the Irish Department of\r\nAgriculture, which was established by Act of Parliament in 1899, and in\r\nwhich are vested the powers and functions of the Privy Council in regard\r\nto live stock, with some added powers as well, would, were they appealed\r\nto now, bear testimony to the good work of the Irish railways in regard\r\nto the \"Inland Transit of Cattle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nRAILWAY AMALGAMATION AND CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious as well as tiresome to describe the many railway\r\ncontests in the Committee Rooms at Westminster in which, during the\r\nremainder of my managerial career, it was my lot to be engaged; but one\r\ngreat case there was, in 1899 and 1900, which, by its importance to my\r\ncompany, and I may say, to the south and west of Ireland generally,\r\nshould not pass unnoticed, and of it I propose to give a short account.\r\n\r\nIt was from the grasp of the Waterford and Limerick, as I have mentioned\r\nbefore, that in 1892 we (the Midland) sought, though unsuccessfully, to\r\nsnatch possession of the Ennis line.  Now the Waterford and Limerick were\r\nto lose, not only the Ennis line, but all their lines and their own\r\nidentity as well.  A great struggle ensued which, from the length of time\r\nit lasted, and the number of combatants engaged, was one of the biggest\r\nrailway fights the Committee Rooms had for many a long year witnessed.\r\nFor 106 days, from first to last, the battle raged.  In it thirty-one\r\ncompanies and public bodies participated, most of them being represented\r\nby counsel. There was a famous Bar, including all the big-wigs of course,\r\nand some lesser wigs, and numbering more than twenty in all.  The\r\npromoters were very strongly represented, but we had Littler for our\r\nleader, who, indeed, was our standing senior counsel.  Their team\r\nconsisted of Pope, Pember, Balfour Browne, Seymour Bushe, McInerny and\r\ntwo juniors; our, much smaller but well selected, of Littler,\r\nBlennerhassett and Vesy Knox; the last-named then a rising junior, but\r\nlong since a senior, and for some time past a leader, is still to the\r\nfront in the bustling, reckless, impatient world of to-day.  Most of the\r\nothers, alas, are no longer with us.  Littler later on was knighted, but\r\nis beyond all earthly honours now, and so are Pope, Pember and\r\nBlennerhassett.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, the proceedings occupied two sessions.  In the first,\r\n1899, two Bills came before a Select Committee of the House of Commons,\r\none promoted jointly by the Great Southern and Western and the Waterford\r\nand Limerick Companies, the other by the Great Southern and the Waterford\r\nand Central Ireland.  But the Great Southern were the real promoters of\r\nboth; they paid the piper and, therefore, called the tune.  The Great\r\nSouthern being the largest railway company in Ireland aspired to be\r\ngreater still, nor need this be considered in the least surprising, for\r\nwho in this world, great or small, is ever satisfied?  The Waterford and\r\nLimerick, a line of 350 miles, then ranked fourth amongst the railways of\r\nIreland, and its proposed absorption by the Great Southern and Western\r\nCompany aroused no little interest.  The Central Ireland, a small concern\r\nof 65 miles, running from Maryborough to Waterford, was a secondary\r\naffair altogether and I shall say little more about it.  The Waterford\r\nand Limerick had its headquarters at Limerick, its southern terminus at\r\nWaterford, its northern at Sligo--a direct run from south to north of 223\r\nmiles, certain branch lines making up the rest of its mileage.  Its\r\naccess to Sligo was by means of the Athenry to Tuam, the Tuam to\r\nClaremorris and the Claremorris to Collooney lines, all of which it\r\nworked.  The last-mentioned was one of the \"Balfour\" light railways\r\n(constructed on the ordinary Irish gauge of 5 feet 3 inches) and should\r\nhave been given to the Midland Company, but by some unfortunate\r\n_contretemps_, when constructed, it passed into the hands of the\r\nWaterford and Limerick.  From Collooney to Sligo (six miles) running\r\npowers were exercised by that company over the Midland line into Sligo.\r\nThis Claremorris-Collooney line intersected the Midland system and in the\r\nhands of the Waterford and Limerick Company introduced a competition in\r\nConnaught which that poor district could ill afford to bear--a district\r\nin which one railway system alone, though it enjoyed the whole of the\r\ntraffic, would scarcely earn a living.  The Waterford and Limerick was\r\nnot what would be called a prosperous line, nor was its physical\r\ncondition anything to boast of, but it had latent possibilities, and was\r\nin active competition with the Great Southern.  Such railway competition\r\nas existed in Ireland was dear to traders and the general public.  In\r\ncountry towns in the sister Isle there is not (more the pity!) much afoot\r\nin the way of diversion, and to set the companies by the ears or get the\r\nbetter of either one or the other was looked upon as healthy and innocent\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of June the contest began, and this, the first engagement,\r\nlasted for 44 days, when the Chairman of the Committee announced that the\r\nBills would not be passed.  Great was our delight and that of our allies,\r\nthough the cup of joy was a little dashed on learning that the Great\r\nSouthern had determined to renew the struggle in the following year.\r\n\r\nMy company was the principal opponent, and bore the brunt of the fight,\r\nthough the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway (now the Dublin and South-\r\nEastern) were vigorous opponents too.  A. G. Reid (from Scotland, who I\r\nhave mentioned before) was general manager of the Dublin and Wicklow\r\nRailway.  Like myself he is a pensioner now enjoying the evening of life.\r\nLiving near each other in the pleasant Kingstown-Dalkey district, we meet\r\nnot infrequently, and when we do our talk, as is natural, often glides\r\ninto railway reminiscence.  We fight our battles over again.  We had many\r\nallies, prominent amongst them being the City and Harbour Authorities of\r\nLimerick.  They were represented by good men who were hand and glove with\r\nus.  Sir (then Mr.) Alexander Shaw, John F. Power and William Holliday\r\nwere particularly conspicuous for their valuable assistance.  Power (well\r\nnamed) was a host in himself.  Strong, keen, clever, energetic,\r\nenthusiastic, yet cautious and wary, he was a splendid witness.  I\r\nsometimes said he would have made a fine railway manager, had he been\r\ntrained to the business.  Could I give him higher praise?\r\n\r\nMr. Littler was in great feather at our success.  He entertained us\r\n(_i.e_., his Midland clients) to lunch.  Over coffee and cigars we\r\nlearned that he had not been in Ireland for over 20 years; so to equip\r\nhim the better for next year's fight we invited him over, promising that\r\nI would be his faithful cicerone on a tour through the country.  As soon\r\nas Parliament rose he came, and he and I spent a fortnight together,\r\nvisiting Limerick, Waterford, Cork, Galway, Sligo and other places.  It\r\nwas a sort of triumphal march, for our friends, and they were many,\r\nwarmly welcomed on Irish soil the great English Q.C. who had routed the\r\nenemy.  Littler enjoyed it immensely, and was charmed with Irish warmth\r\nand Irish ways.  Full of good humour and good nature himself, with a\r\nlively wit, and an easy unaffected manner, he gained new friends to our\r\ncause, and increased the zeal of old ones.  He was a charming companion,\r\na keen observer and interested in everything he saw and everybody he met.\r\n\r\nBefore the next session arrived my company determined upon a bold course,\r\nand decided to themselves lodge a Bill to acquire the Waterford and\r\nLimerick line.  There was much to be said for this.  With the Waterford\r\nand Limerick in our hands the competition, which the public loved, would\r\ncontinue, whilst in the hands of the Great Southern monopoly would\r\nprevail.  That we would command much public support seemed certain.  So\r\nin the following year three Bills were presented to Parliament, viz.:--\r\n\r\n   Midland Great Western\r\n   Great Southern and Western and Waterford and Limerick\r\n   Great Southern and Western and Waterford and Central Ireland\r\n\r\nThat Parliament regarded these proposals as being of more than ordinary\r\nimportance is clear from the fact that it referred the three Bills to a\r\nJoint Select Committee of both Houses--Lords and Commons--describing them\r\nas \"The Railways (Ireland) Amalgamation Bills.\"  An experienced and able\r\nchairman was appointed in the person of Lord Spencer.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of May the proceedings opened.  Day by day every inch of\r\nground was stubbornly fought, and on the 12th of July the decision of the\r\nCommittee was announced.  After the presentation of the Great Southern\r\ncase our Bill was heard and all the opposition.  One of the most\r\neffective witnesses for the Great Southern was Sir George (then Mr.)\r\nGibb, general manager of the North-Eastern, the only big railway in the\r\ncountry that enjoyed a district to itself.  His _role_ was to persuade\r\nthe Committee that railway monopoly, contrary to accepted belief, was a\r\nboon and a blessing, and well he fulfilled his part.\r\n\r\nMy examination did not take place until July 6th, after nearly all other\r\nwitnesses had been heard.  Mr. Littler intentionally kept me back, which\r\nwas a great advantage to me, as when placed in the box I had practically\r\nheard what everybody else had said, and the last word, as every woman\r\nknows, is not to be despised.  Littler took me through my \"proof.\"  I had\r\nspent the whole of the previous Sunday with him at his house at Palmer's\r\nGreen and we had gone through it together most carefully.  He attached\r\ngreat importance to my direct evidence, and we underlined the parts I was\r\nto be particularly strong upon.  That I had taken great pains to prepare\r\ncomplete and accurate evidence I need scarcely say, for, as I have stated\r\nbefore, if there is any kind of work I have liked more than another, and\r\ninto which I have always put my heart and soul, it is this kind.  After\r\nwe had got through I was cross-examined by eight opposing counsel,\r\nincluding Pope, Pember, Balfour Browne and Seymour Bushe.  One of the\r\nvery few things connected with my appearance in the case I have preserved\r\n(and this I have kept from vanity, I suppose) is a newspaper cutting\r\nwhich says, \"In cross-examination Mr. Pope could not get a single point\r\nout of Mr. Tatlow.  On the contrary it actually made his case stronger.\r\nHis evidence from beginning to end was most masterly.  It was the\r\nevidence of a man who knew what he was talking about and who told the\r\ntruth.  Mr. Pope, in the end, agreed with Mr. Tatlow's statement on\r\nrunning powers.\"  Mr. Pope was a big, generous-minded man.  In the course\r\nof his great speech on the case he paid me the very nice compliment of\r\nsaying that, \"Mr. Tatlow went into the box and with a candour that did\r\nhim great credit at once admitted that they (the clauses) were the most\r\nstringent that he knew of.\"  This from opposing counsel was a compliment\r\nindeed, and I was much complimented upon it.  Mr. Pope greatly admired\r\ncandour, and indeed I found myself that candour always told with the\r\nCommittees.  Littler loved Pope, and so did all the Parliamentary Bar, of\r\nwhich he was the acknowledged leader and the respected father.  Littler\r\nsaid to me, \"He is a wonderfully and variously gifted man, and had he\r\nchosen the stage as a profession would have been a David Garrick.\"  I\r\nsaid, \"What about his very substantial person?\" for he was colossal in\r\nfigure.  \"I had forgotten that,\" said Littler.  Littler told me a good\r\nstory of him which Pope, he said, was also fond of telling himself.\r\n\r\nIt was in the great man's biggest and busiest days.  Influenza was rife.\r\nMr. Pope was a bachelor, and his valet inconsiderately took the \"flu.\"\r\nMr. Pope's nephew said the valet must go away till he fully recovered, or\r\nMr. Pope would be sure to take it.  \"What shall I do?\" said Mr. Pope, in\r\ndismay.  \"Oh, I'll get you a good man for the time,\" said the nephew; and\r\nso he did; a skilful, quiet, efficient, attentive man, whose usual duty\r\nit was to attend on a rich old gentleman, who resided, on account of a\r\nlittle mental derangement, in a certain pleasant private establishment.\r\nMr. Pope had not been told, nor had he inquired, where the excellent\r\nvalet, with whom he was well pleased, hailed from, nor had the valet\r\nasked any questions concerning Mr. Pope.  Both seemed to have jumped to\r\ncertain conclusions.  After the valet had been there a week or more, one\r\nday, when _downstairs_, he said to the servants: \"Tell me, what is it\r\nthat is wrong with the master?  He seems to me to be as sane as any of\r\nus!\"\r\n\r\nBalfour Browne, in his book _Forty Years at the Bar_, says, \"He\" (Mr.\r\nPope) \"had a broad equitable common sense, and never did anything mean or\r\nlittle.\"  He was certainly an orator, and displayed in his speeches much\r\ndramatic power.  His voice was fine, flexible and sonorous.  In his later\r\nyears he must often have wished his \"too too solid flesh would melt,\" for\r\nit had become a heavy burden.  He had to be wheeled from Committee Room\r\nto Committee Room in a perambulating chair, and was allowed to remain\r\nseated when addressing Committees.  On the 12th of July Lord Spencer\r\nannounced that \"the Great Southern Amalgamation Bill may proceed subject\r\nto clauses as to running powers, etc.\"  This meant that _our_ Bill was\r\ngone, and that the Great Southern had gained possession of the Waterford\r\nand Limerick, Ennis, the line to Collooney and running powers to Sligo.\r\nThus they had secured a monopoly in Munster and an effective competition\r\nwith us in poor Connaught.  It was hard lines for the Midland, but all\r\nwas not yet lost.  If only we could obtain running powers to Limerick and\r\ncarry them back to Ireland, we should have secured some of the spoil.\r\nAnother week was spent fighting over running powers, facilities, etc.,\r\nand I was in the witness box again.  Balfour Browne and Littler now\r\nconducted the warfare on either side, and keenly they fought.  The\r\nCommittee at one time seemed disposed to put us off with little or\r\nnothing.  In the box I know I waxed warm--\"the Great Southern to get all\r\nand we nothing--iniquitous,\" and then, \"the public interest to count for\r\nnought--Oh, monstrous!\"  Well, in the end, on the 19th of July, we were\r\nawarded full running powers to Limerick, and--the curtain fell!\r\n\r\nThe Act came into operation on the 2nd of January, 1901, the 1st being a\r\nSunday.  On the 8th we ran our first running power train, and the Joy\r\nBells rang in Limerick.  The Great Southern threatened us with an\r\ninjunction because we began to exercise our powers before the terms of\r\npayment, etc., were fixed between us; but we laughed at threats and went\r\ngaily on our way.  Limerick rewarded us by giving us their traffic.\r\n\r\nIn this last amalgamation year (1900) we were in the Committee Rooms also\r\nin connection with another case--the Kingscourt, Keady and Armagh Railway\r\nBill; but, I will say no more about it than that we opposed the Bill for\r\nthe purpose of obtaining proper protection of Midland interests.\r\n\r\nThe year 1900 brought a general Act of some importance called the\r\n_Railway Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act_.  It empowered the\r\nBoard of Trade to make rules with the object of reducing or removing the\r\ndangers and risks incidental to certain operations connected with railway\r\nworking, such as braking of wagons, propping and tow roping, lighting of\r\nstations, protection of point rods and signal wires, protection to\r\npermanent way men, and other similar matters.  It also empowered the\r\nBoard to employ persons for carrying the Act into effect.\r\n\r\nNineteen hundred, take it all in all, was a busy, interesting and\r\ndelightful year.  Though we did not succeed in acquiring the Waterford\r\nand Limerick Railway, which I may now say we scarcely expected, for\r\n_compulsory_ railway amalgamation was then unheard of, yet our _bold\r\ncourse_ was regarded with considerable success (as boldness often is) and\r\nthe running powers we had won were pecuniarily valuable as well as\r\nstrategically important.  Sir Theodore Martin, our Parliamentary Agent,\r\nand who had taken the keenest interest in the contest, wrote me: \"After\r\nall I do not much regret the issue of the fight the Midland have had.  To\r\nhave got running powers to Limerick, and to have to give nothing for them\r\nis a substantial triumph.\"  So also thought my Chairman and Directors,\r\nfor on the 25th of July they passed the following Board minute:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved unanimously, that having regard to the great exertions of Mr.\r\nTatlow in connection with the several Bills before Parliament, and the\r\nDirectors being of opinion that the favourable terms obtained by this\r\nCompany were due to the great care and attention given by him, they have\r\nunanimously decided to raise Mr. Tatlow's salary 200 pounds a year on and\r\nfrom the 1st inst.\"\r\n\r\nNot a very great amount in these extravagant days, perhaps, but in\r\nIreland, nineteen years ago, it was thought quite a big thing; and it had\r\nthe additional charm of being altogether unexpected by its grateful\r\nrecipient.\r\n\r\nSir Theodore Martin, though 84 years of age, was full of intellectual and\r\nphysical vigour.  He was a sound adviser, and enthusiastic in the\r\namalgamation business.  Poet, biographer and translator, he kept up his\r\nintellectuality till the last, and the end of his interesting life did\r\nnot come until he reached his 94th year.  In 1905 he published a\r\ntranslation of Leopardi's poems.  Between us arose a much greater\r\nintimacy than the ordinary intimacy of business, and his friendship,\r\nthrough a long series of years, I enjoyed and highly valued.\r\n\r\n[Sir Theodore Martin: martin.jpg]\r\n\r\nBetween the two periods of the Amalgamation control I sandwiched a\r\ndelightful holiday, and in the autumn of 1899, after the conclusion of\r\nthe great Ballinasloe Fair, travelled east as far as Constantinople.  Were\r\nthis a book of travel (which it is not) a chapter might be devoted to\r\nthat trip.  But the cobbler must stick to his last, though a word or two\r\nmay, perhaps, be allowed on the subject, if only by way of variety.\r\n\r\nMy companions on this interesting tour were my good friends F. K. and H.\r\nH.  We went by sea from Southampton to Genoa, where we stayed two days to\r\nenjoy the sunshine and colour; its steep, picturesque and narrow streets,\r\nand its beautiful old palaces.  Then we visited Milan and Venice.  At\r\nVenice we spent several days, charmed with its beauty.  From Trieste we\r\ntook an Austrian Lloyd steamer, the _Espero_, to Constantinople.  At\r\nPatras we left the steamer to rejoin it at Piraeus, wending our way by\r\nrail along the Gulf of Corinth to Athens, in which classical city we\r\nstayed the night.  Messrs. Gaze and Sons had ordered their guide (or\r\ndragoman as he was called) to meet us and devote himself to our service.\r\nThe next morning at 7 o'clock, he called for us at our hotel, and from\r\nthat hour till noon, under his guidance, we visited the temples and\r\nmonuments of ancient Athens, and inspected the modern city also.  In the\r\nafternoon we drove or rather ploughed our way from Athens to Piraeus\r\n(five miles) along the worst road I ever traversed, not excepting the\r\nstreets of Constantinople.  We found the harbour gay with music, flags\r\nand bunting, in honour of a great Russian Admiral who was leaving his\r\nship to journey by ours to Constantinople.  His officers bade him\r\nrespectful farewells on the deck of our steamer, and he ceremoniously\r\nkissed them each and all.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second day after leaving home, at six o'clock in the\r\nmorning, we were aroused in our berths and informed that we had arrived\r\nat Constantinople.  The morning, unfortunately, was dull, and our first\r\nview of the Ottoman city, therefore, a little obscured.  All the same, it\r\nwas a great sight, with its minarets and towers, its Golden Horn and\r\ncrowded quays.  Our dragoman kept at bay all the clamouring crowd of\r\nporters, guides and nondescripts of all colours and races that besieged\r\nus.  It was 8.30 a.m. when we landed, but 3.30 p.m. by Turkish time.  The\r\nMoslem day is from sunset to sunset, and sunset is always reckoned 12\r\no'clock; an awkward arrangement which the reforming \"Young Turk\" perhaps\r\nhas since altered.  The week we spent in Constantinople was all too\r\nshort.  We stayed at the Pera Palace Hotel, and the first night after\r\ndinner, in our innocence, strolled out.  All was dark and dismal; no one\r\nin the streets.  We went as far as the quays, strolled back and on the\r\nway called at a small cafe, the only inmate of which was a dwarf, as\r\nremarkable looking as Velasquez's _Sebastian de Morra_.  The hall porter\r\nat our hotel was waiting our return with anxiety.  \"It was not safe to be\r\nout at night,\" he said; \"we had gold watches on us and money in our\r\npurses, and knives were sharp.\"  Murray's guide book, we afterwards\r\nfound, gave similar warning, without mentioning knives.  Sir Nicholas\r\nO'Connor was our Ambassador in Constantinople.  He was an Irishman from\r\nCounty Mayo, and I had a letter of introduction to him from my friend Sir\r\nGeorge Morris.  Sir Nicholas invited me to lunch at Therapia, where the\r\nEmbassy was in residence in its summer quarters.  He was exceedingly kind\r\nand facilitated our sightseeing in the great city during our stay.  We\r\nwitnessed the Selamlik ceremony of the Sultan's weekly visit for prayers\r\nto the Mosque Hamedieh Jami, which stands adjacent to the grounds of\r\nYildiz Kiosk.  It was worth seeing.  There was a great gathering of\r\nmilitary in splendid uniforms and glittering decorations.  Seven handsome\r\ncarriages contained his principal wives, or ladies of the harem (wives we\r\nwere told), and several of the Sultan's sons (mere youths) were there,\r\nbeautifully apparelled.  We caught glimpses of the ladies through their\r\ncarriage windows, and being women (though veiled) I should be surprised\r\nif they, on their part, did not get glimpses of us.  There were eunuchs\r\ntoo, black frock-coated--and the chief eunuch, an important personage who\r\nranks very high.  Then came the Sultan (Abdul Hamid) himself in an open\r\ncarriage, closely surrounded and guarded by officers.  He was an elderly,\r\ncareworn, bearded, sallow, melancholy looking man, whose features seemed\r\nincapable of a smile.  He entered the Mosque alone; his wives remaining\r\nseated in their carriages outside.  In the room in which we sat at an\r\nopen window to view the ceremony we were regaled with the Sultan's coffee\r\nand cigarettes.\r\n\r\nThe streets and bazaars of Constantinople were absorbingly interesting.\r\nThe various nationalities that everywhere met the eye; the flowing\r\neastern costumes, the picturesque water carriers, the public letter\r\nwriters patiently seated at street corners and occupied with their\r\nclients, the babel of voices, and yet an Oriental indolence pervading\r\nall, crowds but no hurry; the sonorous and musical sound of the Muezzin\r\ncall to prayers from the minarets--all was new and strange; delightful\r\ntoo, if you except the dogs that beset the streets and over which, as\r\nthey lay about, we stumbled at every step.  They are now a thing of the\r\npast.  Poor brutes, they deserved a better fate than the cruel method of\r\nextinction which Turkish rule administered.\r\n\r\nOf course we visited Stamboul's greatest Mosque, S. Sophia.  Many other\r\nMosques we saw, but none that approached the majesty of this.  One, the\r\nChurch of the Monastery of the Chora, famous for its beautiful mosaics,\r\nwe did not see, although the German Emperor had driven specially to it on\r\nhis visit in 1898 to the Sultan.  The only good road Constantinople\r\nseemed to possess was this road to the church, which lies outside the\r\ncity, and this road, we were told, was constructed for the convenience of\r\nHis Imperial Majesty.\r\n\r\nOne day, on the bridge that spans the Golden Horn, we passed the Grand\r\nVizier in his carriage.  It was the day on which we crossed the Bosphorus\r\nby steamer to visit Scutari on the Asiatic shore.  Scutari commands a\r\nsplendid view of the city, the Golden Horn, and the Bosphorus in its\r\nwinding beauty, right away to the Black Sea.  What a city some day will\r\nConstantinople be!  The grandest perhaps on earth.  In Scutari we heard\r\nthe Howling Dervishes at their devotions, and the following day, in\r\nConstantinople, witnessed a _performance_ shall I call it? of the Dancing\r\nDervishes in their whirling, circling, toe-revolving exercise.  The\r\nobject of both is said to be to produce the ecstatic state in which the\r\nsoul enters the world of dreams and becomes one with God.  There is no\r\nquestion as to the ecstatic, nay frenzied state many of them attained.\r\n\r\nOur last day was the eve of the Ramadan Fast.  At eight o'clock that\r\nnight we left by train to journey homeward overland, for time demanded\r\nthat we should go back much quicker than we came.\r\n\r\nWe broke our journey for two days at Buda-Pesth, and looked on the\r\nDanube; at Vienna we stayed a little longer, and found that gay city hard\r\nto leave.  We drove and rode in the Prater, and horseback exercise in\r\nsuch a place was, I need not say, delightful.  We stopped at Frankfort,\r\nenjoyed its opera and other things, then, _via_ Ostend, wended our way to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nA CONGRESS AT PARIS, THE PROGRESS OF IRISH LINES, EGYPT AND THE NILE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Will you undertake to report on the subject of Light Railways for the\r\nInternational Railway Congress at Paris?\"  This question was put to me in\r\nthe year 1899, and although I was busy enough, without shouldering\r\nadditional work, I at once said \"Yes,\" and this was how I came to spend\r\npart of my 1900 annual holiday in the beautiful but crowded capital of\r\nFrance.  Crowded it was almost to suffocation, for 1900 was the Great\r\nExhibition year, and all the world and his wife were there.  The Railway\r\nCongress took place in September.  The business part of the proceedings\r\ncame first, and I did not stay for the festivities.  When my Report was\r\nmade and discussed (a reporter was not allowed to read his paper, but was\r\nrequired to speak from notes), I made, with three railway friends from\r\nDublin, tracks for Switzerland.  It had been a strenuous year and\r\nmountain air and exercise were needed to restore one's physical strength\r\nand jaded faculties.\r\n\r\n\"_Means of developing light railways.  What are the best means of\r\nencouraging the building of light railways_?\"  This was the text for my\r\npaper, as sent to me by the Congress, and my Report, I was told, should\r\nbe confined to the United Kingdom, Mr. W. M. Acworth having undertaken a\r\nreport on the subject for other countries.\r\n\r\nIn my Report I first disposed of Ireland, concerning which and its light\r\nrailways I have already written with some fullness in these pages; and my\r\nreaders, I am sure, will not be surprised to hear that, as regards that\r\ncountry I answered the question remitted to me by saying that the only\r\npractical means I could see of further encouraging the construction of\r\nlight railways in Ireland was by the wise expenditure of additional\r\nGovernment Grants, while as regards England, I pointed out that she had\r\nfor long preferred to dispense with light railways, that, as forcibly\r\nexpressed in _The Times_, she alone of civilised countries had but one\r\nstandard for her railways, that is \"the best that money could buy\"; that\r\ntimes had changed, and in 1894 and 1895 much discussion and investigation\r\non the subject had taken place, brought about chiefly, I thought, by\r\ndepression in agriculture; that the energy which France, Germany, Sweden,\r\nBelgium and Italy had expended on their light railway systems, especially\r\nin agricultural and rural districts, had helped to further concentrate\r\npublic opinion on the question; that a conference had been held at the\r\nBoard of Trade and a Committee appointed to investigate the subject; that\r\nthis Committee, after various sittings, had reported in favour of\r\nlegislation, and that the result had been that the _Light Railway Act_ of\r\n1896 had come into being.  My paper also dealt with this Act, explaining\r\nits scope, its limitations and what its effect had been during the\r\ncomparatively short time (only four years) it had been in force; and my\r\nconclusion was that in Great Britain no further facilities were at that\r\ntime required for encouraging the building of light railways, the best\r\npolicy in my judgment being, to give the Act a fair trial, as time only\r\ncould show to what extent the railways to be made in virtue of its\r\nprovisions would fulfil the objects for which it had been passed.\r\n\r\nMr. Acworth did not tackle the question as affecting other countries.  He\r\nreported that he had no special knowledge which would entitle him to say\r\nhow light railway enterprise could best be developed in countries other\r\nthan his own, and that as my Report \"sufficiently set out the present\r\nposition of affairs in reference to light railways in the United\r\nKingdom,\" he thought the most useful contribution he could offer to the\r\ndiscussion of the question would be \"a short criticism of the working,\r\nboth from a legal or administrative and also from a practical point of\r\nview, of our English Act of 1896.\"\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1896 was one of considerable importance to British Railways\r\nand, therefore, merits a few words.  It established three Commissioners\r\nwho were empowered to make Orders authorising the construction of Light\r\nRailways, including powers for the compulsory acquisition of land;\r\nauthorised the granting of Government loans and, under special\r\ncircumstances, free grants of money.  The Board of Trade might require\r\nany project brought forward under the Act to be submitted to Parliament,\r\nif they considered its magnitude, or the effect it might have on any\r\nexisting railway, demanded such a course.  The Act simplified and\r\ncheapened the process for the acquisition of land, and ordained that in\r\nfixing the price the consequent betterment of other lands held by the\r\nsame owner should be taken into account.  It imparted considerable power\r\nto dispense with certain expensive conditions and regulations in working\r\nrailways constructed under its authority.  Though it was intended\r\nprimarily to benefit agriculture, it was capable of an interpretation\r\nwide enough to include all kinds of tramways, and it has been extensively\r\nused for that purpose, sometimes, I fear, to the detriment of existing\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\nAccording to an article in the Jubilee (1914) number of the _Railway\r\nNews_, by Mr. Welby Everard, up to the end of the year 1912 (since the\r\noutbreak of the war figures are not obtainable) a total of 645\r\napplications (including 111 applications for amending Orders) were made\r\nto the Commissioners, the total mileage represented being 4,861 miles.  Of\r\nthese applications 418 were passed, comprising 2,115 miles, of which,\r\n1,415 miles were in class A, _i.e_. light railways to be constructed on\r\nland acquired or \"cross-country\" lines, that is to say, lines which\r\nlegitimately fulfilled the purposes of the Act.  But, up to October,\r\n1913, only 45 of these lines, with a total length of 441 miles, had been\r\nconstructed and opened for traffic.  The number of applications to the\r\nCommissioners seemed to show a considerable demand for greater facilities\r\nfor transit in rural districts, but capital apparently was slow to\r\nrespond to that demand.  Perhaps it will be different now, in these days\r\nof change and reconstruction.  The Government is pledged to tackle the\r\nwhole question of Transport, and Light Railways will, of course, not be\r\noverlooked, though Motor Traction will run them a close race.\r\n\r\nFor ten years I had now been manager of the Midland Great Western\r\nRailway, and busy and interesting years they were.  In that period Irish\r\nrailways, considering that the population of the country was diminishing,\r\nhad made remarkable progress, and effected astonishing improvements.\r\nWhilst the population of England during the decade had _increased_ by\r\n9.13 per cent., and Scotland by 4.69, that of Ireland had _decreased_ by\r\n4.29 per cent!  Yet, notwithstanding this, the railway traffic in\r\nIreland, measured by receipts, had increased by 22 per cent., against\r\nEngland 31 and Scotland 36.  In the number of passengers carried the\r\nincrease in Ireland was 29 per cent.  In the same period the increase in\r\nthe number of engines and vehicles in Ireland was 22, in England 30, and\r\nScotland 33 per cent., whilst the number of train miles run (which is the\r\nreal measure of the usefulness of railways to the public) had advanced 27\r\nper cent. in Ireland, compared with 28 in England, and 30 in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThese figures indicate what Irish railways had accomplished in the decade\r\nending with December, 1900, and betoken, I venture to affirm, a keen\r\nspirit of enterprise.  These ten years had witnessed the introduction of\r\nbreakfast and dining cars on the trains, of parlour cars, long bogie\r\ncorridor carriages, the lighting of carriages by electricity, the\r\nbuilding of railway hotels in tourist districts, the establishment of\r\nnumerous coach and steamboat tours, the quickening of tourist traffic\r\ngenerally, the adoption of larger locomotives of greatly increased power,\r\nthe acceleration of the train service, the laying of heavier and smoother\r\npermanent way, and a widespread extension of cheap fares--tourist,\r\nexcursion, week-end, etc.  It was a period of great activity and progress\r\nin the Irish railway world, with which I was proud and happy to be\r\nintimately connected.  But what a return for all this effort and\r\nenterprise the Irish railway companies received--3 pounds 17s. 10d. per\r\ncent. on the whole capital expended, plus a liberal amount of abuse from\r\nthe Press and politicians, neither of whom ever paused to consider what\r\nIreland owed to her railways, which, perhaps, all things considered, was\r\nthe best conducted business in the country.  It, however, became the\r\nvogue to decry Irish lines as inefficient and extortionate, and a fashion\r\nonce started, however ridiculous, never lacks supporters.  The public,\r\nlike sheep, are easily led.  In England the average return on capital\r\nexpended was 4 pounds 0s. 5d., and in Scotland 4 pounds 2s. 2d.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1901, Mr. W. H. Mills, the Engineer of the Great\r\nNorthern Railway of Ireland, and I were entrusted by the Board of Works\r\nwith an investigation into the circumstances of the Cork, Blackrock and\r\nPassage Railway in regard to a proposed Government loan to enable the\r\nCompany to discharge its liabilities and complete an extension of its\r\nrailway to Crosshaven.  It was an interesting inquiry, comprising a\r\nbroken contract, the cost of completing unfinished works, the financial\r\nprospects of the line when such works were completed, and other cognate\r\nmatters.  A Bill in Parliament promoted by the Railway Company in the\r\nfollowing year became necessary in connection with the loan, which after\r\nour Report the Government granted, and I had to give evidence in regard\r\nto it.  In the same session I appeared also before two other\r\nParliamentary Committees, so again I had a busy time outside the ordinary\r\ndomestic duties pertaining to railway management.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of November, 1902, my good friend Walter Bailey and I\r\nstarted on a visit to Egypt.  It, like Constantinople and Spain and\r\nPortugal, occupied more than the usual month's vacation, but as these\r\nextra long excursions were taken only every two or three years, and as it\r\nwas never my habit to nibble at holidays by indulging in odd days or week-\r\nends, my conscience was clear, especially as my Chairman and Directors\r\ncordially approved of my seeing a bit of the world, and readily granted\r\nthe necessary leave of absence.  As for Bailey, he always declared this\r\nEgyptian tour was the holiday of his life.  To continue, we arrived in\r\nCairo, _via_ Trieste and Alexandria, on the 10th.  There we were met by\r\nMr. Harrison, the general manager of Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son, and\r\ntheir principal dragoman, _Selim_, whom he placed during our stay in\r\nCairo at our disposal.  _Selim_ was a Syrian and the prince of dragomans;\r\na handsome man, of Oriental dignity and gravity, arrayed in wonderful\r\nrobes, which by contrast with our Occidental attire made Bailey and me\r\nfeel drab and commonplace.  At Cairo we stayed for eight days at\r\nShepheard's Hotel, and under _Selim's_ guidance made good use of our\r\ntime.  On the ninth day we began a delightful journey up the Nile.  Mr.\r\nFrank Cook had insisted upon our being the guests of his firm on their\r\ntourist steamer _Amasis_.\r\n\r\nMy relations with Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son go back for many years, and\r\nwith the Midland of England, my _Alma Mater_, the firm is, perhaps, more\r\nclosely associated than with any other railway.  It was on the Midland\r\nsystem that, in 1841, its business began.  In that year the founder of\r\nthe firm, Mr. Thomas Cook, arranged with the Midland the first public\r\nexcursion train on record.  It ran from Leicester to Loughborough and\r\nback at a fare of one shilling, and carried 570 passengers.  This was the\r\nfirst small beginning of that great tourist business which now encircles\r\nthe habitable globe.  Mr. Thomas Cook was a Derbyshire man and was born\r\nin 1808.  My father knew him well, often talked to me about him, and told\r\nme stories of the excursion and tourist trade in its early days.  But I\r\nam digressing, and must return to Old Father Nile, who was in great\r\nflood.  We saw him at his best.  His banks were teeming with happy dusky\r\nfigures and the smiling irrigated land was bright with fertility.  Our\r\njourney to Assouan occupied eleven days, a leisurely progress averaging\r\nabout two and a-half miles an hour.  During the night we never steamed,\r\nthe _Amasis_ lying up while we enjoyed quiet rest in the quietest of\r\nlands.  Of course we visited all the famous temples and tombs, ruins and\r\nmonuments, of ancient Egypt; and had many camel and donkey rides on the\r\ndesert sands before reaching the first cataract.  At Luxor, where we\r\nstayed for five days, we were pleasantly surprised at seeing Mr. Harrison\r\nand Mr. Warren Gillman come on board.  The latter was Secretary of\r\nMessrs. Cook and Son's Egyptian business, and has, I believe, since risen\r\nhigher in the service of the firm.\r\n\r\nThe great Dam at Assouan was just completed and we traversed its entire\r\nlength on a trolley propelled by natives.  Assouan detained us for four\r\ndays; then, time being important, we travelled back to Cairo by railway.\r\nThree more interesting days were passed in the Babylonian city, then\r\nhomewards we went by the quickest route attainable.\r\n\r\nWhilst in Cairo and on our journey up the Nile, Bailey and I wrote,\r\njointly, a series of seven articles on \"Egypt and its Railways.\"  These\r\nappeared in the _Railway News_ in seven successive weeks during December\r\nand January.\r\n\r\nOur last hours in the land of the Pharaohs were filled with regret at\r\nhaving to leave it so soon.  Said Bailey: \"Cannot you, before we go,\r\nwrite a verse of Farewell?\"  So I composed the following:--\r\n\r\n   Egypt, farewell, and farewell Father Nile,\r\n   Impenetrable Sphinx, eternal pile\r\n   Of broad-based pyramid, and spacious hypostyle!\r\n\r\n   Farewell Osiris, Anubis and Set,\r\n   Horus and Ra, and gentle Meskenhet,\r\n   Ye sacred gods of old, O must we leave you yet?\r\n\r\n   The mighty works of Ramesis the Great,\r\n   Memphis, Karnak and Thebes asseverate\r\n   The pomp and glory, Egypt, of your ancient state.\r\n\r\n   Bright cloudless land!  Your skies of heavenly blue\r\n   Bend o'er your fellaheen the whole day through;\r\n   Night scarce diminishes their sweet celestial hue.\r\n\r\n   Realm of enchantment, break your mystic spell,\r\n   Land of the lotus, smiling land farewell!\r\n   For ever it may be, what oracle can tell?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nKING EDWARD, A CHANGE OF CHAIRMEN, AND MORE RAILWAY LEGISLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe memorable visit to Ireland of His Majesty King Edward, in the summer\r\nof 1903, which embraced all parts of the country, furnished I think no\r\nincident so unique as his reception in Connemara.  On the morning of the\r\n30th July the Royal Yacht anchored off Leenane, in Killery Bay, and His\r\nMajesty landed in Connaught.  He was accompanied by Queen Alexandra and\r\nPrincess Victoria.  This was the first time, I believe, that the people\r\nwest of the Shannon had seen their King, and whatever their politics, or\r\naspirations were, he was certainly received with every manifestation of\r\nsincere good will.  His genial personality and ingratiating _bonhomie_,\r\nhis humanity, and his sportsmanlike characteristics, appealed at once to\r\nIrish instincts, and Connaught was as enthusiastic in its welcome as the\r\nrest of Ireland.  The Royal party motored from Leenane to Recess, where\r\nthey lunched at the Company's hotel, and where, of course, the Chairman,\r\ndirectors and chief officers of the railway, as well as local magnates,\r\nwere assembled to assist in the welcome.  On nearing Recess a surprise\r\nawaited the King.  He was met by the \"Connemara Cavalry,\" which escorted\r\nthe Royal Party to the hotel and acted as bodyguard.  Mr. John\r\nO'Loughlin, of Cashel, had organised this new and unexpected addition to\r\nHis Majesty's Forces.  It consisted of about 100 farmers, farmer's sons\r\nand labourers, of all ages from 18 to 80, mounted (mostly bareback) on\r\nhardy Connemara ponies.  \"Buffalo Bill\" hats, decorated with the Royal\r\ncolours or with green ribbon streamers, distinguished them from others.\r\nIt was a striking scene, unexpected, novel, unique; but quite in harmony\r\nwith the surroundings and the wild and romantic scenery of Connemara and\r\nthe Killeries.  The King plainly showed his hearty appreciation.  After\r\nlunch their Majesties visited the marble quarries, situated some three\r\nmiles distant, and reached by a rough and rocky precipitous mountain\r\nroad, for which motor cars were entirely unsuited.  For this journey the\r\nmarble quarry people had ordered a carriage and horses from Dublin, but\r\nwhich, by some unfortunate occurrence, had not turned up.  Though the\r\nonly carriage available in the neighbourhood was ill-suited for royalty,\r\nthe King and Queen, good naturedly, made little of that.  They were too\r\ndelighted with the unmistakable warmth of their welcome to mind such a\r\ntrifle.  Again the \"Cavalry\" were in attendance and escorted the party to\r\nthe quarries and back.\r\n\r\nThe Royal visit to Ireland, on the whole, was an unqualified success, and\r\nthere were many who hoped and believed that the King's good will towards\r\nthe country and its people, and his remarkable gifts as a peacemaker,\r\nwould in some way help to a solution of the Irish question; but, alas!\r\nthat question is with us still, and when and how it will be solved no man\r\ncan tell.  For myself, I am one of those who indulge in _hope_,\r\nremembering that Time, in his healing course, has a way of adjusting\r\nhuman misunderstandings and of bringing about the seemingly impossible.\r\n\r\nIt was in this year (1903) that I first met Charles Dent, the present\r\nGeneral Manager of the Great Northern Railway of England.  He had been\r\nappointed General Manager of the Great Southern and Western Railway in\r\nsuccession to R. G. Colhoun.  Dent and I often met.  We found we could do\r\ngood work for our respective companies by reducing wasteful competition\r\nand adopting methods of friendly working.  In this we were very\r\nsuccessful.  A man of few words, disdaining all unnecessary formalities,\r\nbut getting quickly at the heart and essence of things, it was always a\r\npleasure to do business with him.\r\n\r\nIn this year also I enjoyed some variety by way of an inquiry which I\r\nmade for the Board of Works, concerning certain proposed light railway\r\nextensions, called the Ulster and Connaught, and which involved the\r\nticklish task of estimating probable traffic receipts and working\r\nexpenses--a task for which the gift of prophecy almost is needed.  To\r\ndetermine, in this uncertain world, the future of a railway in embryo\r\nmight puzzle the wisest; but, with the confidence of the expert, I faced\r\nthe problem and, I hope, arrived at conclusions which were at least\r\nwithin a mile of the mark.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 that fine old railway veteran, Sir Ralph Cusack, resigned his\r\nposition of Chairman of the Midland and was succeeded by the Honourable\r\nRichard Nugent, youngest son of the ninth Earl of Westmeath; Major H. C.\r\nCusack, Sir Ralph's nephew and son-in-law, becoming Deputy Chairman--the\r\nfirst (excepting for a few brief months in 1903 when Mr. Nugent occupied\r\nthe position) the Midland ever had.  With Sir Ralph's vacation of the\r\nchair, autocratic rule on the Midland, which year by year, had steadily\r\nbeen growing less, disappeared entirely and for ever.  Well, Sir Ralph in\r\nhis long period of office had served the Midland faithfully, with a\r\nsingle eye to its interests, and good wishes followed him in his\r\nretirement.  Mr. Nugent was a small man, that is physically, but\r\nintellectually was well endowed.  He had scholarly tastes and business\r\nability in pretty equal parts.  Movement and activity he loved, and, as\r\nhe often told me, preferred a holiday in Manchester or Birmingham to the\r\nRiviera or Italian Lakes.  He liked to be occupied, was fond of details,\r\nand possessed a lively curiosity.  Sometimes he was thought, as a\r\nchairman, to err in the direction of too rigid economy, but on a railway\r\nsuch as the Midland, and in a country such as Ireland, economy was and is\r\nan excellent thing, and if he erred, it was on the right side.  Truth,\r\ncandour, courage and enthusiasm marked his character in a high degree.\r\nFearless in speech, the art of dissimulation he never learned.  I shall\r\nnot readily forget a speech he once made at the Railway Companies'\r\nAssociation in London.  It was on an occasion of great importance, when\r\nall the principal companies of the United Kingdom were present.  It was\r\naltogether unpremeditated, provoked by other speeches with which he\r\ndisagreed, and its directness and courage--for it was a bold and frank\r\nexpression of honest conviction, such as tells in any assembly--created\r\nsome stir and considerable comment.  Of plain homely mother-wit he had an\r\nuncommon share, and his mind was stored with quotations which came out in\r\nhis talk with wonderful ease and aptness.  A shrewd observer, his\r\ncomments (always good-natured if critical) on his fellow men were worth\r\nlistening to.\r\n\r\nOur almost daily intercourse was intimate and frank.  Sometimes we\r\nwandered into the pleasant fields of poetry and literature, but never to\r\nthe neglect of business.  He had an advantage that I greatly envied; a\r\nsplendid memory; could repeat verse after verse, stanza upon stanza,\r\nwhole cantos almost, from his favourite poet, Byron.  It was at the half-\r\nyearly meetings of shareholders (they were held half-yearly in his day)\r\nthat he specially shone, not in his address to them (for that he _would_\r\npersist in reading) but in the after proceedings when the heckling began.\r\nThis, during his chairmanship, was often severe enough, for owing to\r\nunavoidably increased expenditure, dividends were diminishing and\r\nshareholders, in consequence, were in anything but complacent mood.\r\nQuestion time always put him on his mettle.  Then his mother-wit came\r\nout, his lively humour and practical common sense--all unstudied and\r\nnatural.  The effect was striking.  Rarely did he fail in disarming\r\ncriticism, producing harmony, and sending away dissentients in good\r\ntemper, though some of them, I know, sometimes afterwards wondered how it\r\ncame about that they had been so easily placated.\r\n\r\nFrom 1903 to 1906 several Acts of Parliament affecting railways generally\r\ncame into force, four of which were of sufficient importance to merit\r\nattention.  The first, the _Railways (Electric Power) Act_, 1903, was a\r\nmeasure to facilitate the introduction and use of electrical power on\r\nrailways, and invested the Board of Trade with authority to make Orders\r\nfor that purpose, which were to have the same effect as if enacted by\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe second, the _Railway Fires Act_, 1905, was an Act to give\r\ncompensation for damage by fires caused by sparks or cinders from railway\r\nengines, and increased the liability of railway companies.  It _inter\r\nalia_, enacted that the fact that the offending engine was used under\r\nstatutory powers should not affect liability in any action for damage.\r\n\r\nNext came the _Trades Disputes Act_, 1906, a short measure of five\r\nclauses, but none the less of great importance; a democratic law with a\r\nvengeance!  It is one of the four Acts which A. A. Baumann, in his recent\r\nbook, describes as being \"in themselves a revolution,\" and of this\r\nparticular Act he says it \"placed the Trade Unions beyond the reach of\r\nthe laws of contract and of tort.\"  It also legalised peaceful picketing,\r\nthat particular form of persuasion with which a democratic age has become\r\nonly too familiar.\r\n\r\nLastly, the _Workmen's Compensation Act_, of 1906, an Act to consolidate\r\nand amend the law with respect to compensation to workmen for injuries\r\nsuffered in the course of their employment, is on the whole a beneficial\r\nand useful measure, to which we have grown accustomed.\r\n\r\nIn these years I had other holiday trips abroad; some with my family to\r\nFrance and Switzerland, and two with my friend, John Kilkelly.  One of\r\nthese two was to Denmark and Germany; the other to Monte Carlo and the\r\nRiviera.  In Germany, at Altona, we saw the Kaiser \"in shining armour,\"\r\nfresh from the autumnal review of his troops, though indeed I should\r\nscarcely say _fresh_, for he looked tired and pale, altogether different\r\nto the stern bronzed warrior depicted in his authorised photographic\r\npresentments which confronted us at every turn.  Kilkelly was a busy, but\r\nnever seemed an overworked man, due I suppose to some constitutional\r\nquality he enjoyed.  Added to a good professional business of his own, he\r\nwas Solicitor to the Midland, Crown Solicitor for County Armagh,\r\nSolicitor to the Galway County Council, and, in _his leisure hours_,\r\nfarmed successfully some seven or eight hundred acres.  He had a fine\r\nportly presence, and though modesty itself, could not help looking as if\r\nhe were _somebody_, like the stranger in London, accosted by Theodore\r\nHook in the Strand, who was of such imposing appearance that the wit\r\nstopped him and said: \"I beg your pardon, sir, but, may I ask, are you\r\nanybody in particular?\"\r\n\r\nAt Monte Carlo we both lost money but revelled in abundant sunshine, and\r\ncontemplated phases of humanity that to us were new and strange.  Soon we\r\ngrew tired of the gaming table and its glittering surroundings, bade it\r\nadieu, and explored other parts of the Riviera, moving at our ease from\r\nscene to scene and from place to place.\r\n\r\nKilkelly was an excellent travelling companion, readily pleased, and\r\ntaking things as they came with easy philosophy.  But never more shall we\r\ntravel together, at home or abroad.  A year ago, at the age of 82, he\r\npassed from among us on the last long journey which we all must take.\r\n\r\n   _Requiescat in pace_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nVICE-REGAL COMMISSION ON IRISH RAILWAYS, 1906-1910, AND THE FUTURE OF\r\nRAILWAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn previous pages I have spoken of the manner in which the railways of\r\nIreland had long been abused.  This abuse, as the years went on, instead\r\nof diminishing grew in strength if not in grace.  The Companies were\r\nstrangling the country, stifling industry, thwarting enterprise; were\r\nextortionate, grasping, greedy, inefficient.  These were the things that\r\nwere said of them, and this in face of what the railways were\r\naccomplishing, of which I have previously spoken.  Politics were largely\r\nat the bottom of it all, I am sure, and certain newspapers joined in the\r\nnoisy chorus.  At length the House of Commons, during the Session of\r\n1905, rewarded the agitators by adopting the following resolution:--\r\n\r\n   \"_That in the opinion of this House, excessive railway rates and\r\n   defective transit facilities, generally, constitute a serious bar to\r\n   the advancement of Ireland and should receive immediate attention from\r\n   the Government with a view to providing a remedy therefor_.\"\r\n\r\nThis Resolution bore fruit, for in the ensuing year (1906), in the month\r\nof July, a Vice-Regal Commission was appointed to inquire into the\r\nsubject, and the Terms of Reference to the Commission included these\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n   \"_What causes have retarded the expansion of traffic upon the Irish\r\n   lines and their full utilization for the development of the\r\n   agricultural and industrial resources of the country; and, generally,\r\n   by what methods the economical, efficient, and harmonious working of\r\n   the Irish Railways can best be secured_.\"\r\n\r\nAs the newspapers said, the Irish Railway Companies were put upon their\r\ntrial.  As soon as the Commission was appointed the Companies (19 in\r\nnumber) assembled at the Railway Clearing House in Dublin to discuss the\r\nsituation, and decide upon a course of action.  Unanimously it was\r\nresolved to act together and to make a common defence.  A Committee,\r\nconsisting of the Chairman and General Managers of the seven principal\r\ncompanies, was appointed and invested with full power to act in the\r\ninterest of all, as they should find desirable.  The Right Honourable Sir\r\nWilliam (then Sir William) Goulding, Baronet, Chairman of the Great\r\nSouthern and Western Railway, was appointed Chairman of the Committee.  I\r\nwas appointed its Secretary, and Mr. Croker Barrington its Solicitor.  It\r\nwas further decided that one general case for the associated railways\r\nshould be prepared and presented to the Commission by one person, who\r\nshould also (under the direction of the Committee) have charge of all\r\nproceedings connected with the Inquiry.  I, to my delight, was\r\nunanimously selected as that person, and to enable me to do the work\r\nproperly, I was allowed to select three assistants.  My choice fell upon\r\nG. E. Smyth, John Quirey, and Joseph Ingram, and I could not have chosen\r\nbetter.  We were allotted an office in the Railway Clearing House; my\r\nassistants gave their whole time to the work, and I gravitated between\r\nBroadstone and Kildare Street, for of course I had to look after the\r\nMidland Great Western as well as the Commission business.  That I could\r\nnot, like Sir Boyle Roche's bird, be in two places at once, was my\r\ngreatest disappointment.  I may record here that each of my assistants\r\nhas since, to borrow an Americanism, \"made good.\"  Smyth is now Traffic\r\nManager of the Great Southern and Western Railway; Quirey is Chief\r\nAccountant of the Midland Railway of England, and Ingram became Secretary\r\nof the Irish Clearing House, from which be has been recently promoted to\r\nan important position under the Ministry of Transport (Ireland).\r\n\r\nThe way in which the seven Companies worked together, and the success\r\nthey attained was, I think, something to be proud of.  Sir William\r\nGoulding was an excellent Chairman.  There was just one little rift in\r\nthe lute.  One of the seven Companies showed a disposition, at times, to\r\nplay off its own bat, but this was, after all, only a small matter, and\r\nthe general harmony, cohesion and unanimity that prevailed were\r\nadmirable, and unquestionably productive of good.  We had as Counsel, to\r\nguide and assist the Committee, and to represent the Companies before the\r\ntribunal, Mr. Balfour Browne, K.C.; Mr. Jas. Campbell, K.C. (now the Rt.\r\nHon. Sir James Campbell, Baronet, Lord Chancellor of Ireland); Mr. T. M.\r\nHealy, K.C.; Mr. Vesey Knox, K.C.; and Mr. G. Fitzgibbon.  They served us\r\nwell, and were all required.  During the proceedings, prolonged as they\r\nwere, each could not of course always appear, and it was important to\r\nhave Counsel invariably at hand.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Scotter was appointed Chairman of the Commission.  He was\r\nChairman of the London and South Western Railway; had risen from the\r\nranks in the railway service; had been a general manager, and was\r\nunquestionably a man of great ability; but he was handicapped by his age,\r\nwhich even then exceeded the Psalmist's allotted span.  His health\r\nmoreover was not good, and in less than six months after the completion\r\nof the work of the Commission, he departed this life at the age of 75.\r\n\r\nMr. George Shanahan, Assistant Secretary of the Board of Works, was the\r\ncapable Secretary of the Commission.  He had the advantage of being a\r\nrailwayman.  From the service of the Great Northern Railway, Robertson\r\ntook him with him to the Board of Works in the year 1896.\r\n\r\nBefore the Commission began its public sittings it issued and freely\r\ncirculated a printed paper entitled \"_Draft Heads of Evidence for\r\nTraders, Industrial Associations, Commercial and Public Bodies, etc_.\"\r\nThis paper invited complaints under various set headings and concluded\r\nwith these words:--\r\n\r\n   \"Whether there is any other question that might be usefully considered\r\n   in determining the _causes that have retarded the expansion of traffic\r\n   upon the Irish lines_, and their full utilization for the development\r\n   of the agricultural and industrial resources of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThe italics are mine.  We, rightly or wrongly, looked upon this paragraph\r\nas _assuming_ the case against the Companies to have some foundation in\r\nfact and likely to bias neutral opinion against us, and when (after the\r\nhearing was concluded) three of the seven Commissioners reported that the\r\nevidence \"led them to doubt whether expansion of traffic had been\r\nretarded,\" we felt that our view was not without justification.  But I am\r\nanticipating the findings of the Commission, and perhaps, after all, the\r\npeculiar Terms of the Reference largely dictated the course of procedure\r\nwhich the Commission adopted.\r\n\r\nThe first public sitting was held in Dublin on the 12th of October, 1906,\r\nand the last in the same city on the 29th of January, 1909.  There were\r\n95 public sittings in all; and 293 witnesses were examined, 29 of whom\r\nappeared on behalf of the Railway Companies.  The Reports of the\r\nCommissioners (for there were two--a Majority and a Minority Report) did\r\nnot appear till the 4th of July, 1910, so from the time of its\r\nappointment until the conclusion of its work the Commission covered a\r\nperiod of four years, all but fourteen days.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this Inquiry I passed through a crisis in my life.\r\nFrom more than a year before the Commission was appointed I had been in\r\nmost indifferent health, the cause of which doctors both in Dublin and in\r\nLondon were unable to discover.  As time went on I became worse.\r\nRecurring attacks of intense internal pain and constant loss of sleep\r\nworked havoc with my strength; but I held on grimly to my work, and few\r\nthere were who knew how I suffered.  One day, indeed, at the close of a\r\nsitting of the Commission, Sir John (then Mr.) Aspinall came over to\r\nwhere I sat, and said: \"How ill you have looked all day, Tatlow; what is\r\nwrong?\"  By the time March, 1907 came round, finding I could go on no\r\nlonger, I went to London and saw three medical men, one of whom was the\r\neminent surgeon, Sir Mayo (then Mr.) Robson.  He, happily, discovered the\r\ncause of my trouble, and forthwith operated upon me.  It was a severe and\r\nprolonged operation, but saved my life and re-established my health.  Not\r\nuntil late in July was I able to resume work--an enforced absence from\r\nduty of four long months.  In this absence my three assistants carried on\r\nthe Commission work with great efficiency.  It was a trying experience\r\nthat I passed through, but from it I gathered some knowledge of what a\r\nman can endure and still perform his daily task, and what the value of\r\ntrue and sympathetic friendship means to one in a time of suffering.  It\r\nwas during this illness that my friend, F. K. shewed what a true friend\r\nhe was.  He, and my dear kinsman Harry, devoted themselves to me,\r\nespecially during my convalescence, giving up their time ungrudgingly and\r\naccompanying me to the Mediterranean and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe presentation of the Railway case and the rebutting evidence did not\r\nbegin till all the public witnesses had been heard.  My evidence, on\r\nbehalf of the associated companies, occupied five days.  Other railway\r\nmanagers followed with evidence specially affecting their own railways,\r\nand one Chairman (Mr. F. W. Pim, Dublin and South-Eastern Railway) also\r\nappeared in the witness box.  We had also as a witness Mr. E. A. Pratt,\r\nthe well-known journalist and author of works on railways and commercial\r\nsubjects, who gave evidence for us regarding Continental railway rates\r\nand conditions of transit abroad, in answer to evidence which had been\r\ngiven on the subject by an official of the Department of Agriculture.  An\r\nextraordinary amount of importance had been attached to Continental\r\nrailway rates as compared with rates in Ireland, and the Department had\r\nsent their representative abroad to gather all the information he could.\r\nHe returned, armed with figures, and submitted lengthy evidence and\r\nnumerous tables.  A great outcry had been made for years in the Press and\r\non the platform that rates in Ireland were exorbitant compared with\r\nContinental rates; and now, it was thought, this will be brought home to\r\nthe Irish Companies.  Mr. Pratt was well informed, having investigated\r\nthe subject thoroughly in various countries, and written and published\r\nbooks and articles thereon.  Between us we were able to show the\r\nunfairness of the comparisons, the dissimilarity of the circumstances of\r\neach country, and the varied conditions and nature of the services\r\nrendered in each, and the Commissioners in the Majority Report confessed\r\nthat after a full consideration of the evidence, they did not think any\r\nuseful purpose would be served by attempting to make particular and\r\ndetailed comparisons between Continental and Irish rates.\r\n\r\nI could write much that would be interesting about the proceedings and\r\nthe evidence given against and for the Companies; how reckless were many\r\nof the charges brought against them, how easily they were disproved; how\r\nsubtle and disingenuous other charges were and what skill was required to\r\nrefute them; how some of the witnesses were up in the clouds and had to\r\nbe brought down to common earth; how conclusively the Companies proved\r\nthat the railways had done their best to encourage and help every\r\nindustry and that their efforts had not been unsuccessful; but I will\r\nresist the temptation, and proceed to the Reports which the Commissioners\r\npresented to His Excellency the Lord Lieutenant.  As I have said, there\r\nwere two reports, one signed by four, the other by three Commissioners.\r\nThe Majority Report bore the signatures of the Chairman, the Rt. Hon.\r\nLord Pirrie, Colonel (now Sir) Hutcheson Poe, and Mr. Thomas Sexton,\r\nwhile the Minority Report was signed by Sir Herbert Jekyll, Mr. W. M.\r\nAcworth, and Mr. (now Sir) John Aspinall.  The first-mentioned Report was\r\nnot so favourable to the railways as the other, yet the worst thing it\r\nsaid of the Companies was that they were commercial bodies conducted on\r\ncommercial principles and ran the railways for profit, and it admitted\r\nthat Irish railway managers neglected few opportunities for developing\r\ntraffic.  In a sort of way it apologised for the evidence-seeking printed\r\npapers to which I have already referred, and admitted that had the\r\nCommissioners been in possession of the statistics of trade and industry\r\npublished in 1906 by the Department of Agriculture (which seemed to have\r\nsurprised them by the facts and figures they contained of Ireland's\r\nprogress) these circulars might have been framed differently.  The Report\r\nalso said that the complaints the Commissioners received would have been\r\nfewer in number if some of the public witnesses had been better informed\r\nand had taken pains to verify their statements.  The Commissioners\r\nfurther reported that they were satisfied that it was impracticable for\r\nthe Railway Companies, as commercial undertakings, to make such reduction\r\nin rates as was desired, and, \"as the economic condition of the country\r\nrequired,\" but it was not mentioned that no inquiry had been made as to\r\nthe economic condition alluded to.  In regard to this question of\r\neconomic condition the Minority Report took a more modest view.  It\r\nexpressed the opinion that regarding the causes which had retarded the\r\nexpansion of traffic upon the Irish lines, \"A complete answer would\r\ninvolve an inquiry ranging over the whole field of agriculture and\r\nindustry in all its aspects,\" and that this the Commissioners had not\r\nmade.  It also added that the statistics of Irish trade which had been\r\npublished by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction\r\nsince the commencement of the Inquiry led them (the Minority\r\nCommissioners) to doubt whether the expansion of traffic _had_ been\r\nretarded.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Majority Report.  The Commissioners who signed it were\r\nof opinion that Ireland needed special treatment in regard to her\r\nrailways and that public acquisition (not State acquisition) and public\r\ncontrol of a unified railway system was the consummation to be desired.\r\nIn their view, if only this were accomplished blessings innumerable would\r\nensue and all complaints would for ever cease.  As to the way in which\r\nthis unification and public control were to be carried out, they\r\nrecommended that an Irish Authority should be instituted to acquire the\r\nIrish Railways and work them as a single system, that this Authority\r\nshould be a railway Board of twenty Directors, four nominated and sixteen\r\nelected; that the general terms of purchase be those prescribed by the\r\nRegulation of Railways Act of 1844; that the financial medium be a\r\nRailway Stock; and that such Stock be charged upon (1) The Consolidated\r\nFund; (2) the net revenues of the unified railway system; (3) an annual\r\ngrant from the Imperial Exchequer; and (4) a general rate to be struck by\r\nthe Irish Railway Authority if and when required.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners who signed the Minority Report said the evidence, as a\r\nwhole, had not produced the same general effect upon their minds as upon\r\nthe minds of their colleagues, and they were inclined to attach less\r\nimportance than their colleagues did to the evidence given against the\r\nIrish Railway Companies, and more importance to the evidence given in\r\ntheir favour.  In their opinion the result of the evidence was, that if\r\nthe Companies were to be considered as having been on their trial, _they\r\nwere entitled_ _to a verdict of acquittal_, and that no case had been\r\nmade out for the reversal of railway policy which their colleagues\r\nadvocated.  They added that it would hardly be disputed that the Railways\r\nhad on the whole conferred great benefits upon Ireland.\r\n\r\nOn the question of reductions in rates (reductions which the Majority\r\nReport strongly urged as necessary), they did not think that reductions\r\nwere more likely to occur under public than under private ownership.  They\r\nsuggested, further, that the official statistics of various countries\r\nshowed that the fall in the average rate had been much greater on the\r\nprivately owned railways of France and the United States than on the\r\nState-owned railways of Prussia, which were universally accepted as the\r\nmost favourable example of State managed railways in the world.  They\r\ncame to the conclusion, after hearing all the evidence, that the\r\nmanagement of the principal Irish Companies was not inferior to that of\r\nsimilar companies in England and Scotland.  They narrated the many\r\nimprovements (with which they seemed much impressed) that Irish Companies\r\nhad in recent years effected for the benefit of the public and the good\r\nof the country, and said \"they had spent money, and not always\r\nprofitably, in endeavouring to promote the development of new\r\nindustries.\"  They considered the principle of private ownership should\r\nbe maintained, believing that railways are better and more economically\r\nmanaged by directors responsible to their own shareholders than they\r\nwould be under any form of State or popular control, and that\r\nadministration on commercial principles was the best in the public\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn their opinion, however, the Irish railway system was faulty by reason\r\nof its sub-division into so many independent companies, and they\r\nrecommended a policy of amalgamation, with the ultimate object of\r\nincluding the principal railways in one single system, and also, that\r\ncertain lines classed as railways, but which were really tramways serving\r\npurely local interests, need not be incorporated with the general railway\r\nsystem.  Such amalgamation, they considered, need not be effected at one\r\ntime, but should be accomplished gradually.  Failing amalgamation by\r\nvoluntary effort within three years, compulsion should be resorted to.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the Reports were highly satisfactory to the Irish railways.\r\nThey showed that the Companies had done their duty to the country\r\nhonestly and well, and that they had been unjustifiably attacked.  The\r\ngood character of the Irish railways was thus re-established, and they\r\nagain held their rightful place in public esteem.\r\n\r\nOf the two I much preferred the Minority Report.  The working of the\r\nIrish railways (in accordance with its Recommendations) as business\r\nconcerns on commercial principles, seemed to me both sound and sensible\r\nand the policy best calculated to serve the interests of the country.  I\r\ncannot, however, say that I concurred in that part of the Minority Report\r\nwhich proposed the welding of all the railways of Ireland into one great\r\nsystem.  In my humble opinion, the formation of three large systems--a\r\nNorthern, a Midland and a Southern--was the desirable course to adopt.\r\nThis course would, at any rate, keep alive the spirit of emulation which,\r\nin itself, is a wholesome stimulant to enterprise and endeavour, as well\r\nas to economy.\r\n\r\nThe Majority Report, which amongst other things said, \"We consider it\r\nobvious that Irish development will not be fully served by the railways\r\nuntil they cease to be commercial undertakings,\" found favour mostly, I\r\nthink, with those who looked upon Ireland as an exceptional country\r\nrequiring eleemosynary treatment, and whose railways ought, in their\r\nview, to be placed beyond the ordinary healthy necessity of paying their\r\nway.  Our Chairman, the Honourable Richard Nugent, addressing his\r\nshareholders at the time, put the matter rather neatly.  He said: \"The\r\ncase, as recommended by the Majority Report, stands thus--the Government\r\nto find the money for purchasing the railways; the Government to\r\nguarantee the interest on the capital cost; the County Councils to work\r\nthe railways on uncommercial lines; the Government to pay to the extent\r\nof 250,000 pounds a year any deficiency incurred by uncommercial\r\nmanagement; and any further annual losses to be paid by the County\r\nCouncils striking a general rate, which you and I and all of us would be\r\nrequired to pay.\"  He added, \"Does this seem a businesslike proposal?\"\r\n\r\nThe Government took no steps towards carrying out the Recommendations of\r\neither Report.  Perhaps they thought them so nearly divided, and so\r\nalmost evenly balanced, that the one neutralised the other.  They may\r\nalso have thought that each Report made it clear that the Irish railways\r\nwere well managed, not lacking in enterprise or energy, were doing well\r\nfor the country; and that, therefore, the wisest course was to \"let well\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nWere we living in ordinary times, had there been no world-wide war, with\r\nits vast upheavals and colossal changes, it would be both interesting and\r\nprofitable to further discuss the Reports, their conclusions and\r\nrecommendations; but the war has altered the whole railway situation, and\r\nit would be idle to do so now.  Victor Hugo says: \"Great events have\r\nincalculable consequences,\" which is unquestionably true in respect of\r\nthe railways and the war.  The vital question now in regard, not only to\r\nthe railways of Ireland, but to the railways of the whole United Kingdom,\r\nis as to their future.  It is, however, with the Irish railways I am\r\nspecially concerned, and of them I may pretend to have a little\r\nknowledge, which must be my excuse for saying a few words more on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe Irish railways, like those of Great Britain, are at present\r\ncontrolled by the Government, under the _Regulation of the Forces Act_,\r\n1871--a war arrangement which is to be continued, under the powers of the\r\n_Ministry of Transport Act_, for a further period of two years, \"with a\r\nview to affording time for the consideration and formulation of the\r\npolicy to be pursued as to the future position\" of the railways.  This\r\narrangement, temporary in its nature, provides, as is pretty generally\r\nknown, that during its continuance, the railway companies shall be\r\nguaranteed the same net income as they earned in the year preceding the\r\nwar, viz., 1913.  So far so good.  But two years will quickly pass; and\r\nwhat then?  It is also generally known that the Government control of the\r\nrailways, during the war and since, has resulted in enormous additions to\r\nthe working expenses.  Perhaps these additions were inevitable.  The cost\r\nof coal, and of all materials used in the working of railways, advanced\r\nby leaps and bounds; but the biggest increase has been in the wages bill.\r\nThe Government granted these increases of wages, and also conceded\r\nshorter hours of labour, involving an immensity of expense, on their own\r\nresponsibility, without consultation with the Irish railway companies.\r\nUpon the Irish railway companies, for the present position of affairs no\r\nresponsibility, therefore, rests.  Again I say, the course which the\r\nGovernment adopted was, perhaps, inevitable.  They had to win the war.\r\nLabour was clamorous and insistent, and serious trouble threatened.  High\r\nreasons of State may be presumed to have dictated the Government policy.\r\nAnyhow the thing is done, and the hard fact remains that the Irish\r\nrailways have been brought to such a financial condition that, if they\r\nwere handed back to the companies, many of them not only could not pay\r\nany dividends but would be unable to meet their fixed charges whilst some\r\nwould not be able to even pay their working expenses.\r\n\r\nIn England the opinion is held that a proper balance between receipts and\r\nexpenditure can be restored by increased charges and reduced expenditure.\r\nThis may be so in England, with its teeming population and its almost\r\nillimitable industrial resources.  As to that I venture no opinion, but\r\nIreland is very differently situated.  It is mainly an agricultural\r\ncountry, and for most of its railways no such promising prospect can, it\r\nseems to me, be discerned.  To _unduly_ increase rates would diminish\r\ntraffic and induce competition by road and sea.  Past experience teaches\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nIt used to be said that railway companies asserted, in justification of\r\ntheir rates, that they were fixed on the principle of \"what the traffic\r\ncould bear,\" and the companies were reproached on the ground that the\r\nprinciple involved an injustice, but a principle which involved the\r\nimposition of rates beyond what the traffic _could bear_, could hardly be\r\nsaid to be either sound or just.  However that may be, the Government\r\nhave imposed upon the Irish railways a burden of working expenses which\r\nthey cannot bear.  What is the remedy?  Whatever course is adopted, it is\r\ndevoutly to be hoped that it will be fair and just to the proprietors of\r\na railway system, which has done so much for Ireland, and in respect of\r\nwhich the proprietors have received on their capital an annual return\r\naveraging less than 4 per cent.!  No bloated capitalists these.  Irish\r\nrailway shareholders largely consist of people of moderate means, and\r\ntheir individual holdings, on the Midland Great-Western, for example,\r\naverage only 570 pounds per shareholder.\r\n\r\nWhilst I am by nature optimistic, I must confess that in these latter\r\ndays my optimism occasionally receives a shock.  Nevertheless, I believe\r\nthat the spirit of justice still animates the British people and\r\nParliament; that fair treatment will be accorded to the owners of Irish\r\nrailways, and that they shall not suffer by the policy which the\r\nGovernment, under the stress of war, have pursued.  Railway directors are\r\nalive to the seriousness of the position, and may I think be trusted to\r\nsee that no precaution will be neglected to secure for their companies\r\nfair terms from the Government.  Shareholders also I am glad to observe\r\nare banding themselves together for the protection of their interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nTHE GENERAL MANAGERS' CONFERENCE, GOODAY'S DINNER, AND DIVERS MATTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after the Vice-Regal Commission had concluded its public sittings,\r\nand long before its Reports were issued, I had the pleasure of receiving\r\nfrom the associated companies a cordial minute of appreciation of the\r\nwork I had done, accompanied by a handsome cheque.  Nor was this mark of\r\nappreciation confined to me.  My friend, Croker Barrington, Solicitor to\r\nthe Committee, who had given yeoman service, and my capable assistants,\r\nwere not overlooked.\r\n\r\nSir William Goulding was proud of his chairmanship, and well he might be,\r\nfor during the long and trying period of the Inquiry he kept his team\r\nwell together and (no easy task) discharged the duties of Chairman with\r\nadmirable tact and ability.  He was well entitled to the Resolution of\r\ncordial thanks which the associated companies accorded to him.  I should,\r\nI feel, be lacking in gratitude if I failed to acknowledge also the\r\ninvaluable help afforded me by my brother managers, help ungrudgingly and\r\nunstintingly given.\r\n\r\nThe Irish railways did not stand still.  Their march along the path of\r\nprogress and improvement continued _sans_ interruption.  From 1906 to\r\n1910 (the Commission period) railway business, measured by receipts,\r\nadvanced in Ireland by seven per cent., compared with six per cent. in\r\nEngland and three per cent. in Scotland!\r\n\r\nIn November, 1909, as was my habit unless prevented by other important\r\nduties, I attended the General Managers' Conference at the Railway\r\nClearing House in London, and to my surprise and delight was unanimously\r\nelected Chairman of the Conference for the ensuing year, the first and\r\nonly occasion on which the Manager of an Irish railway has been selected\r\nto fill that office.\r\n\r\nThe Conference consists of the General Managers of all railways who are\r\nparties to the London Clearing House, which means all the principal\r\nrailways of the United Kingdom.  Other Conferences there were such as the\r\nGoods Managers', the Superintendents', the Claims Conference, etc., but\r\nit was the General Managers' Conference that dealt with the most\r\nimportant matters.\r\n\r\nI remember that, in returning thanks for my election, I ventured on a few\r\nremarks which I thought appropriate to the occasion.  Amongst other\r\nthings I said it was breaking new ground for the Conference to look to\r\nIreland for a Pope, but that in doing so they exhibited a catholicity of\r\noutlook which did them honor; and I added that, in filling the high\r\noffice to which they had elected me, though I should certainly never\r\npretend to the infallibility of His Holiness, I should no doubt find it\r\nnecessary at times to exercise his authority.  At ten o'clock in the\r\nmorning this little attempt at pleasantry seemed to be rather unexpected,\r\nbut it raised a laugh, which, of course, was something to the good.  The\r\nConference was a businesslike assembly that prided itself on getting\r\nthrough much work with little talk--an accomplishment uncommon at any\r\ntime, and particularly uncommon in these latter days.  In these restless\r\ndays when--\r\n\r\n   \"_What this troubled old world needs_,\r\n   _Is fewer words and better deeds_.\"\r\n\r\nMy year of office quickly passed and I got through it without discredit,\r\nindeed my successor to the chair, Sir (then Mr.) Sam Fay, writing me just\r\nafter his election, said that I \"had won golden opinions,\" and expressed\r\nthe hope that he would do as well.  Of course he did better, for he was\r\nfar more experienced than I in British railway affairs, and this was only\r\nhis modesty.  My friend Sir William (then Mr.) Forbes was my immediate\r\npredecessor as Chairman, and to him I was indebted for the suggestion to\r\nthe Conference that I should succeed him in the occupancy of the chair.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1910 a delightful duty devolved upon me, the duty of\r\npresiding at a farewell dinner to J. F. S. Gooday, General Manager of the\r\nGreat Eastern Railway, to celebrate his retirement from that position,\r\nand his accession to the Board of Directors.  For some years it had been\r\nthe custom, when a General Manager retired, for his colleagues to\r\nentertain him to dinner, and for the Chairman of the Conference to\r\nofficiate as Chairman at the dinner.  Gooday's brother Managers flocked\r\nto London from all parts of the kingdom to do him honor, for whilst he\r\nwas esteemed for his ability as a manager, he was loved for his qualities\r\nas a man.  Of refined tastes, including a _penchant_ for blue china,\r\nbeing a thriving bachelor, he was able to gratify them.  We were so fond\r\nof him that the best of dinners was not enough, in our estimation, to\r\nworthily mark the occasion and to give him the pleasure he wished, and we\r\npresented to him some rare blue vases which _Cousin Pons_ himself would\r\nhave been proud to possess.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of my office of Chairman of the Conference, I also, during\r\n1910, sat as a member of the Council of the _Railway Companies'\r\nAssociation_.  This Association, of which I have not yet spoken, merits a\r\nword or two.  As described by its present Secretary, Mr. Arthur B. Cane,\r\nit is \"a voluntary Association of railway companies, established for the\r\npurpose of mutual consultation upon matters affecting their common\r\ninterests, and is the result of a gradual development.\"  It dates back as\r\nfar as the year 1854, when a meeting of Railway Directors was held in\r\nLondon to consider certain legislative proposals which resulted in the\r\nRailway and Canal Traffic Act of that year.  In its present form it\r\nconsists of all the principal railway companies of the United Kingdom,\r\neach Company being represented by its Chairman, Deputy Chairman, General\r\nManager and Solicitor.  A Director of any so associated Company, who is a\r\nMember of Parliament, is also _ex officio_ a member of the Association.\r\nAs its membership increased it was found that the Association was\r\ninconveniently large for executive purposes, and some twenty years or so\r\nago a _Council_ was formed with power to represent the Association on all\r\nquestions affecting general railway interests.  At this moment this\r\nCouncil is engaged in looking after the interests of the railway\r\ncompanies in the matter of the great _Ways and Communications Bill_.  By\r\nthe suffrages and goodwill of my colleagues in Ireland, who had the\r\nelection of one member, I remained on the Council till the end of the\r\nyear 1912.  Mr. Cane states that \"The Association has always preserved\r\nits original character of a purely voluntary association, and has been\r\nmost careful to safeguard the independence of its individual members.\"\r\nAlso, that it has \"been expressly provided by its constitution that no\r\naction shall be taken by the Council unless the members are unanimous.\"\r\nFor many years Sir Henry Oakley was its honorary secretary, performing\r\n_con amore_ the duties which were by no means light, but in 1898 it was\r\nresolved to appoint a paid secretary and to establish permanent offices,\r\nwhich now are located in Parliament Street, Westminster.  Mr. (now Sir\r\nGuy) Granet was the first paid secretary, Mr. Temple Franks succeeded\r\nhim, and Mr. Cane, as I have already mentioned, is the present occupant\r\nof the office.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1910 I visited the English Lakes and spent a fortnight\r\nin that beautiful district, in the company, for the first few days, of\r\nWalter Bailey; and during the latter part of the fortnight, with E. A.\r\nPratt as a companion.  It was the last holiday Bailey and I spent\r\ntogether, though happily at various intervals we afterwards met and dined\r\ntogether in London, and our letters to each other only ended with his\r\nlamented death.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1913 a new form of Railway Accounts came into operation.  This\r\nnew form became compulsory for all railways by the passing, in 1911, of\r\nthe _Railway Companies (Accounts and Returns) Act_.  This Act is the last\r\ngeneral railway enactment that I shall have to mention, for no\r\nlegislation of importance affecting railways was passed between 1911 and\r\n1913; and since the war began no such legislation has even been\r\nattempted, excepting always the _Ways and Communications Bill_ which, as\r\nI write, is pursuing its course through the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe form of half-yearly accounts prescribed by the _Regulation of\r\nRailways Act_, 1868, admirable as they were, in course of time were found\r\nto be insufficient and unsatisfactory.  They failed to secure, in\r\npractice, such uniformity as was necessary to enable comparisons to be\r\nmade between the various companies, and in 1903 a Committee of Railway\r\nAccountants was appointed by the Railway Companies' Association to study\r\nthe subject, with the view of securing uniformity of practice amongst\r\nBritish railways in preparing and publishing their accounts.  This\r\nCommittee, after an expenditure of much time and trouble, prepared a\r\nrevised form, but the companies failed to agree to their general\r\nadoption, and without legislation, compulsion could not of course be\r\napplied.  This led to the Board of Trade, who were keen on uniformity,\r\nappointing, in 1906, a Departmental Committee on the subject.  On this\r\nCommittee sat my friend Walter Bailey.  The Committee heard much\r\nevidence, considered the subject very thoroughly, and recommended new\r\nforms of Accounts and Statistical Returns, which were (practically as\r\ndrawn up) embodied in the Act of 1911, and are now the law of the land.\r\nFrom the shareholders' point of view the most important changes are the\r\nsubstitution of annual accounts for half-yearly ones, and the adoption of\r\na uniform date for the close of the financial year.  In addition to the\r\nmany improvements in the direction of clearness and simplicity which the\r\nnew form of accounts effected, the following two important changes were\r\nmade:--\r\n\r\n(1) _All information relating to the subsidiary enterprises of a company\r\nto be shown separately to that relating to the railway itself_\r\n\r\n(2) _A strict separation to be made of the financial statements from\r\nthose which were of a purely statistical character_\r\n\r\nThe first of these alterations had become desirable from the fact that\r\npractically all the larger railway companies had, in the course of years,\r\nadded to their railway business proper such outside enterprises as\r\nsteamships, docks, wharves, harbours, hotels, etc.\r\n\r\nOne bright morning, in the autumn of 1911, I was summoned to the\r\ntelephone by my friend the Right Honorable Laurence A. Waldron, then a\r\nDirector of the Dublin and Kingstown Railway, and now its Chairman.  He\r\nsaid there was a vacancy on the Kingstown Board; and, supposing the seat\r\nwas offered to me, would I be free to accept it?  As everybody knows, it\r\nis not usual for a railway manager, so long as he remains a manager, to\r\nbe a director of his own or of any other company; so, \"I must consult my\r\nChairman,\" said I.  The Dublin and Kingstown being a worked, not a\r\nworking line, the duties of its directors, though important are not\r\nonerous, and my Chairman and Board readily accorded their consent.  Such\r\nwas my first happy start as a railway director.\r\n\r\n[The Gresham Salver: salver.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe Dublin and Kingstown has the distinction of being the first railway\r\nto be constructed in Ireland.  Indeed, for five years it was the only\r\nrailway in that country.  Opened as far back as 1834, it was amongst the\r\nearliest of the railway lines of the whole United Kingdom.  The Stockton\r\nand Darlington (1825), the Manchester and Liverpool (1830), and the\r\nDundee and Newtyle (1831), were its only predecessors.  Soon after its\r\nconstruction it was extended from Kingstown to Dalkey, a distance of 1.75\r\nmiles.  This extension was constructed and worked on the _atmospheric\r\nsystem_, a method of working railways which failed to fulfil\r\nexpectations, with the result that the Dalkey branch was, in 1856,\r\nchanged to an ordinary locomotive line.\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric system of working railways found favour for a time, and\r\nwas tried on the West London Railway, on the South Devon system, and in\r\nother parts of Great Britain, also in France, but nowhere was it\r\npermanently successful.  The reason of the failure of the system on the\r\nDalkey extension, Mr. Waldron tells me (and he knows all about his\r\nrailway, as a Chairman should) was due to the impossibility of keeping\r\nthe metal disc airtight.  The disc, shaped like a griddle, was edged with\r\nleather which had to be heavily greased to enable it to be drawn through\r\nthe pipe from which the air was pumped out, in order to create a vacuum,\r\nand the rats, like nature, abhorring a vacuum, gnawed the greasy leather,\r\nletting in the air, and bringing the train to a standstill!\r\n\r\nThe Kingstown Railway was also interesting in another respect, as\r\nillustrating the opposition which confronted railways in those early\r\ndays.  There was a Mr. Thomas Michael Gresham, who was the owner of the\r\nwell-known Gresham Hotel in Dublin, and largely interested in house\r\nproperty in Kingstown--Gresham Terrace there is called after him.  He\r\norganised a successful opposition to the Dublin and Kingstown Railway\r\nbeing allowed--though authorised by Parliament--to go into Kingstown, and\r\nits terminus was for some years Salthill Station (Monkstown) a mile away.\r\nMr. Gresham's action was so highly appreciated--incredible as it now\r\nappears--that he was presented with a testimonial and a piece of plate\r\nfor his \"_spirited and patriotic action_.\"  I have adorned this book with\r\na photograph of the salver which, with the inscription it bears, will I\r\nthink, in these days, be not uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe year 1911 was darkened for me by the shadow of death.  During its\r\ncourse I lost my wife, who succumbed to an illness which had lasted for\r\nseveral years, an illness accompanied with much pain and suffering borne\r\nwith great courage and endurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nFROM MANAGER TO DIRECTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nI had long cherished the hope that when, in the course of time, I sought\r\nto retire from the active duties of railway management, I might, perhaps,\r\nbe promoted to a seat on the Board of the Company.  Presumptuous though\r\nthe thought may have been, I had the justification that it was not\r\ndiscouraged by some of my Directors, to whom, in the intimacy of after\r\ndinner talk, I sometimes broached the subject.  But I little imagined the\r\nchange would come as soon as it did.  I had fancied that my managerial\r\nactivities would continue until I attained the usual age for\r\nretirement--three score years and five.  On this I had more or less\r\nreckoned, but\r\n\r\n   \"_There's a divinity that shapes our ends_\r\n   _Rough hew them how we will_,\"\r\n\r\nand it came to pass that at sixty-one I exchanged my busy life for a life\r\nof comparative ease.  And this is how it came about.  A vacancy on the\r\nBoard of Directors unexpectedly occurred in October, 1912, while I was in\r\nParis on my way home from a holiday in Switzerland and Italy.  I there\r\nreceived a letter informing me that the Board would offer me the vacant\r\nseat if it really was my wish to retire so soon.  Not a moment did I\r\nhesitate.  Such an opportunity might never come again; so like a prudent\r\nman, I \"grasped the skirts of happy chance,\" and the 5th day of November,\r\n1912, saw me duly installed as a Director of the Company which I had\r\nserved as Manager for close upon twenty-two years.  It was an early age,\r\nperhaps, to retire from that active life to which I had been accustomed,\r\nbut as Doctor Johnson says, \"No man is obliged to do as much as he can\r\ndo.  A man is to have a part of his life to himself.\"  I made the plunge\r\nand have never since regretted it.  It has given me more leisure for\r\npursuits I love, and time has never hung heavy on my hands.  On the\r\ncontrary, I have found the days and hours all too short.  Coincident with\r\nthis change came a piece of good fortune of which I could not have\r\navailed myself had not this alteration in my circumstances taken place.\r\nWhilst in Paris I heard that Mr. Lewis Harcourt (now Viscount Harcourt),\r\nthen Colonial Secretary, had expressed a wish to see me as I passed\r\nthrough London, and on the 28th of October, I had an interview with him\r\nat his office in the House of Commons.  There was a vacancy, he informed\r\nme, on the recently appointed Dominions' Royal Commission, occasioned by\r\nthe resignation of Sir Charles Owens, late General Manager of the London\r\nand South-Western Railway, and a railway man was wanted to fill his\r\nplace.  I had been mentioned to him; would I accept the position?  It\r\ninvolved, he said, a good deal of work and much travelling--voyages to\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and Newfoundland.  Two\r\nyears, he expected, would enable the whole of the work to be done, and\r\nabout twelve months' absence from England, perhaps rather more, but not\r\nin continuous months, would be necessary.  It was a great honor to be\r\nasked, and I had no hesitation in telling him that as I was on the eve of\r\nbeing freed from regular active work, I would be more than happy to\r\nundertake the duty, but--\"But what?\" he inquired.  I was but very\r\nrecently married, I said, and how could I leave my wife to go to the\r\nother side of the globe alone?  No need to do that, said he; your wife\r\ncan accompany you; other ladies are going too.  Then I gratefully\r\naccepted the offer, and with high delight, for would I not see more of\r\nthe great world, and accomplish useful public work at the same time.  Duty\r\nand pleasure would go hand in hand.  I need not hide the fact that it was\r\none of my then Directors, now my colleague, and always my friend, Sir\r\nWalter Nugent, Baronet (then a Member of Parliament), who, having been\r\nspoken to on the subject, was the first to mention my name to Mr.\r\nHarcourt.\r\n\r\nSoon after my retirement from the position of Manager of the Midland, my\r\ncolleagues of the Irish railway service, joined by the Managers of\r\ncertain steamship companies that were closely associated with the\r\nrailways of Ireland, entertained me to a farewell dinner.  Mr. James\r\nCowie, Secretary and Manager of the Belfast and Northern Counties Section\r\nof the Midland Railway of England (Edward John Cotton's old line),\r\npresided at the banquet, which took place in Dublin on the 9th of\r\nJanuary, 1913.  It was a large gathering, a happy occasion, though tinged\r\ninevitably with regrets.  Warm-hearted friends surrounded me, glad that\r\none of their number, having elected to retire, should be able to do so in\r\nhealth and strength, and with such a smiling prospect before him.\r\n\r\nWhen I became a Midland Director, Mr. Nugent was no longer Chairman of\r\nthe Board.  He had been called hence, after only a few days' illness at\r\nthe Company's Hotel at Mallaranny, near Achill Island, where, in January,\r\n1912, he had gone for a change.  In him the company lost a faithful\r\nguardian and I a valued friend.  He was succeeded by Major H. C. Cusack\r\n(the Deputy Chairman), who is still the Chairman of the Company.  A\r\ncountry gentleman of simple tastes and studious habits, Major Cusack,\r\nthough fond of country life, devotes the greater part of his time to\r\nbusiness, especially to the affairs of the Midland and of an important\r\nBank of which he is the Deputy-Chairman.  The happy possessor of an\r\nequable temperament and great assiduity he accomplishes a considerable\r\namount of work with remarkable ease.  For his many estimable qualities he\r\nis greatly liked.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of November I made my _debut_ as a Dominions' Royal\r\nCommissioner, at the then headquarters of the Commission, Scotland House,\r\nWestminster.  Soon the Commissioners were to start on their travels, and\r\nwere at that time holding public sittings and taking evidence.\r\n\r\nThis is a narrative of railway life at home, not of Imperial matters\r\nabroad, and it is therefore clearly my duty not to wander too far from my\r\ntheme; nevertheless my readers will perhaps forgive me if in my next\r\nchapter I give some account of the Commission and its doings.  The fact\r\nthat I was placed on the Commission chiefly because I was a railway man\r\nis, after all, some excuse for my doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nTHE DOMINIONS' ROYAL COMMISSION, THE RAILWAYS OF THE DOMINIONS AND EMPIRE\r\nDEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the history of the British Empire a Royal\r\nCommission was appointed on which sat representatives of the United\r\nKingdom side by side with representatives of the self-governing\r\nDominions.  This Commission consisted of eleven members--six representing\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland and five (one each) the Dominions of Canada,\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and Newfoundland.  The\r\nCommission came into being in April, 1912.  It was the outcome of a\r\nResolution of the Imperial Conference of 1911.  The members of that\r\nConference and of others which preceded it had warmly expressed the\r\nopinion that the time had arrived for drawing closer the bonds of Empire;\r\nthat with the increase in facilities for communication and intercourse\r\nthere had developed a deepened sense of common aims and ideals and a\r\nrecognition of common interests and purposes; and that questions were\r\narising affecting not only Imperial trade and commerce but also the many\r\nother inter-relations of the Dominions and the Mother Country which\r\nclamantly called for closer attention and consideration.  The time at the\r\ncommand of the Conference was found to be too short for such a purpose,\r\nand it was to study problems thus arising, and to make practical\r\nrecommendations that our Commission was appointed.\r\n\r\nThe individuals forming the Commission were, first and foremost, Lord\r\nD'Abernon (then Sir Edgar Vincent).  He was our Chairman, the biggest man\r\nof us all; ex-banker, financial expert, accomplished linguist; a\r\nsportsman whose horse last year won the Irish St. Leger; an Admirable\r\nCrichton; an excellent Chairman.  Then came Sir Alfred Bateman, retired\r\nhigh official of the Board of Trade, a master of statistics and\r\nunequalled in experience of Commissions and Conferences.  He was our\r\nChairman in Canada and Newfoundland and a most capable Chairman he made.\r\nSir Rider Haggard, novelist, ranked third; a master of fact as well as of\r\nfiction; a high Imperialist, and versed both theoretically and\r\npractically in agriculture and forestry.  Next came Sir William (then\r\nMr.) Lorimer of Glasgow, a man of great business experience, an expert\r\nauthority in all matters appertaining to iron and steel and in fact all\r\nmetals and minerals.  He was Chairman of the North British Locomotive\r\nCompany and of the Steel Company of Scotland, also a Director of my old\r\ncompany, the Glasgow and South-Western Railway.  Then Mr. Tom Garnett\r\n(christened Tom), an expert in the textile trade of Lancashire, owning\r\nand operating a spinning mill in Clitheroe; a good business man as well\r\nas a student of \"high politics,\" a scholar and a gentleman.  Of the last\r\nand least, my humble self, I need not speak, as with him the reader is\r\nwell acquainted.\r\n\r\nCanada's representative was the Right Honorable Sir George Foster,\r\nMinister of Trade and Commerce, steeped in matters of State, experienced\r\nin affairs, a keen politician and a gifted orator.\r\n\r\nAustralia selected as her representative Mr. Donald Campbell, a clever\r\nman, well read and of varied attainments, sometime journalist, editor,\r\nlawyer, Member of Parliament, and I don't know what else.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Sir (then Mr.) J. R. Sinclair was New Zealand's excellent\r\nchoice.  A barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of his country,\r\nhe had retired from practice but was actively engaged in various\r\ncommercial and educational concerns and was a member of the Legislative\r\nCouncil of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa's member was, first, Sir Richard Solomon, High Commissioner\r\nfor the Union of South Africa in London.  He died in November, 1913, when\r\nSir Jan Langerman took his place.  Sir Jan was an expert in mining, ex-\r\nPresident of the Rand Chamber of Mines, and ex-Managing Director of the\r\nRobinson Group, also a Member of the Legislative Assembly of South\r\nAfrica.  Keen and clever in business and a polished man of the world, he\r\nwas a valuable addition to the Commission.\r\n\r\nLastly, Newfoundland was represented by the Honorable Edgar (now Sir\r\nEdgar) Bowring, President and Managing Director of a large firm of\r\nsteamship owners.  He was experienced in the North Atlantic trade, in\r\nseal, whale and cod fishing and other Newfoundland industries.  He was\r\nalso a member of the Newfoundland Legislative Council.\r\n\r\nSuch were the members of the Commission.  All endowed with sound common\r\nsense and some gifted with imagination.\r\n\r\nShortly stated the main business of the Commission was to inquire into\r\nand report upon:--\r\n\r\n(a) The natural resources of the five self-governing Dominions and the\r\nbest means of developing these resources\r\n\r\n(b) The trade of these parts of the Empire with the United Kingdom, each\r\nother, and the rest of the world\r\n\r\n(c) Their requirements, and those of the United Kingdom, in the matter of\r\nfood and raw materials, together with the available sources of supply\r\n\r\nThe Commission was also empowered to make recommendations and suggest\r\nmethods, consistent with then existing fiscal policy, by which the trade\r\nof each of the self-governing Dominions with the others, and with the\r\nUnited Kingdom, could be improved and extended.\r\n\r\nMr. E. J. Harding, C.M.G., was our Secretary.  An Oxford man of\r\ndistinction, a member of the permanent staff of the Colonial Office,\r\nstudious, enthusiastic, energetic, of rare temper, tact and patience, he\r\nwas all such a Commission could desire.  He and three or four assistants,\r\nwith local officers selected by the Governments in each of the Dominions,\r\none and all most capable men, formed a Secretariat that served us well.\r\n\r\nThe Commission started operations by taking evidence in London in the\r\nautumn of 1912, but its main work lay in the Dominions, and on the 10th\r\nof January, 1913, we sailed for Australia and New Zealand, touching at\r\nFremantle (Western Australia), Adelaide (South Australia), Melbourne\r\n(Victoria), and Hobart (Tasmania) on our way.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand we travelled through the island from south to north,\r\nstaying in that beautiful country for nearly a month, and holding\r\nsittings in the principal cities.  One sitting we held in the train--a\r\nrecord surely for a Royal Commission.  Easter intervening, we indulged in\r\na few days' holiday in the wonderful Rotorua district, where we enjoyed\r\nits hot springs, its geysers, its rivers, its lakes and its Maori\r\nvillages.  Returning to Sydney, we travelled northwards to Queensland and\r\nthere entered seriously upon our Australian duties, holding sittings at\r\nBrisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart and Perth.  In Queensland\r\nwe penetrated north as far as Bundaberg, Gladstone, Rockhampton and Mount\r\nMorgan.  In the other States tours were made through the irrigation areas\r\nof New South Wales and Victoria, and visits paid to the mines at Broken\r\nHill (New South Wales), the Zeehan district and Mount Lyall (Tasmania);\r\nIron Knob (South Australia), and Kalgoorlie (Western Australia).  Some of\r\nour party penetrated to remoter parts of Australia such as Cairns\r\n(Northern Queensland), Condobolin (west of New South Wales), and\r\nOodnadatta (Central Australia), still the furthest point of railway\r\nextension toward the great Northern Territory.\r\n\r\nTo Tasmania we were able to devote a few days, taking evidence and\r\nenjoying its wonderful beauty.\r\n\r\nFinally, we left Australia on the 9th of June, four months after our\r\nfirst landing on its sunny shores.\r\n\r\nOn arriving home it was determined that for the remainder of the year\r\n1913 we should remain in England and take further evidence in London.\r\n\r\nWe resumed our travels in January, 1914, when we left for South Africa.\r\nThere we held a number of sittings, taking evidence at Capetown,\r\nOudtshoorn, Port Elizabeth, East London, Kimberley, Bloemfontein, Durban,\r\nPietermaritzburg, Pretoria and Johannesburg.  Our journeys to these\r\nvarious places were so planned as to involve our travelling over most of\r\nthe principal railway lines of the Union, so that we were able to see a\r\nconsiderable portion of its beautiful scenery as well as its great mining\r\nand pastoral industries.  Our work finished, most of us returned direct\r\nto England, but some were able to penetrate northwards into Rhodesia, and\r\nreturn by way of the East Coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nIt was our intention, after taking further evidence in London, to proceed\r\nto Canada and Newfoundland, and to return home before the winter began,\r\nwhen we looked forward to making our Final Report.  This intention we\r\npartially fulfilled, as in July, 1914, we sailed from Liverpool, and\r\nafter exchanging steamers at Rimouski, landed at St. John's,\r\nNewfoundland.  There we stayed for a few days whilst the crisis in Europe\r\ndeepened.  We then travelled through the island by railway and crossed to\r\nthe Maritime Provinces of Canada.  On that fatal day in August on which\r\nwar broke out we were in Nova Scotia.  A few days after, the British\r\nGovernment, considering that under such conditions we could not finish\r\nour work in Canada, called us home.  In common with many of our\r\ncountrymen we indulged in the hope that the duration of the war would be\r\na matter of months and not of years, and that we should be able to resume\r\nour work in Canada in the autumn of 1915.  But this was not to be.\r\nHowever, in 1916, the Governments represented on the Commission came to\r\nthe conclusion that the completion of our work ought not to be longer\r\ndelayed, and accordingly, in August, 1916, we sailed again to Canada.\r\n\r\nIn the Maritime Provinces of Canada, in 1914, we visited Sydney, Cape\r\nBreton, Halifax, the Annapolis Valley and Digby in Nova Scotia; St. John,\r\nFredericton and Moncton in New Brunswick, and Charlottetown in Prince\r\nEdward Island.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the resumption of our Canadian work began at Montreal.\r\nThereafter, the great mining districts of Northern Ontario engaged our\r\nattention, where, amongst other valuable products of the earth, nickel,\r\nsilver and gold abound.  From Ontario we travelled westward to Prince\r\nRupert on the British Columbian coast, holding sittings at Saskatoon,\r\nEdmonton and Prince Rupert.  We then proceeded by steamer, through\r\nglorious scenery, southward to Victoria, Vancouver Island.  At Victoria\r\nand also at Vancouver we took evidence.  From Vancouver we journeyed\r\neastwards by the Canadian Pacific Railway over the Rockies, breaking our\r\njourney and holding sittings at Vernon, in the Okanagan Valley, at\r\nCalgary, Regina, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec, devoting\r\nseveral days each to many of these places.  Whilst in British Columbia we\r\nalso visited the lower part of the Okanagan Valley, and whilst in the\r\nprairie provinces stopped at Medicine Hat (where the gas lamps burn day\r\nand night because it would cost more in wages than the cost of the gas to\r\nemploy a man to turn them out).  In Ontario we visited North Bay, Fort\r\nWilliam, Port Arthur, Guelph and Niagara Falls.  In addition some of us\r\ntravelled through the mining districts of British Columbia, and also\r\ninspected the asbestos mines at Thetford, in the Province of Quebec.\r\n\r\nThis is the bald outline of our long and interesting journeys, which by\r\nland and sea comprehended some 70,000 miles.  How bald it is I keenly\r\nfeel, and it would afford me more pleasure than I can tell to give some\r\naccount of our wonderful experiences--of the delight of sailing in\r\nsouthern seas; of the vast regions of the mainland of Australia; of the\r\nmarvels of its tropical parts; of the entrancing beauty of New Zealand\r\nand Tasmania; of the wonders of Canada, the variety of its natural\r\nproductions, its magnificent wheat-growing areas; of the charm of South\r\nAfrica with its glorious climate and its beautiful rolling veldt.  What a\r\nmemory it all is!  Tranquil seas, starlit nights, the Southern Cross,\r\nnoble forests, glorious mountains, mighty rivers, boundless plains; young\r\nvigorous communities under sunny skies, with limitless space in which to\r\nexpand.  I should love to enlarge on these things, but a sense of\r\nproportion and propriety restrains my pen.\r\n\r\nIn all the Dominions we were received with the warmest of welcomes and\r\nmost generous hospitality--governments, municipalities and corporations\r\nvieing with each other in doing us honor, whilst private individuals\r\nloaded us with kindness.  It was clear that our mission was popular, and\r\nclear too that affection for the old country was warm and lively.  I\r\ncannot attempt to narrate all that was done for us--banquets, receptions,\r\nexcursions, garden parties, concerts--time and space will not allow.  But\r\nI cannot be altogether silent about the splendid special train which the\r\nSouth African Government placed at our disposal from the time we left\r\nCapetown until we reached Johannesburg, which (taking evidence at the\r\nvarious places on the way) occupied several weeks.  This sumptuous train\r\nconsisted of dining car, sleeping cars and parlour car, was liberally\r\nstaffed and provisioned; with a skilful _chef_, polite and attentive\r\nwaiters and attendants.  It was practically our hotel during those forty\r\ndays or more.\r\n\r\nIn Australia and New Zealand, more than once, the various governments\r\nprovided us with special cars or special trains to visit their remoter\r\ndistricts with the greatest possible comfort.  The same was the case in\r\nNewfoundland, whilst the Canadian Government lent to us a steamer--the\r\n_Earl Grey_--for our journey from Rimouski to Newfoundland, which since\r\nhas done good service for the Allied cause in the war.\r\n\r\nIn Canada we travelled from Montreal to Prince Rupert, some 3,000 miles,\r\nin a handsome and most commodious car kindly lent to us by Sir Daniel\r\nMann, one of the founders of the Canadian Northern Railway.  It, too, was\r\nour home and hotel during the ten days which that journey occupied.  The\r\nlongest passenger vehicle I had ever seen, it had ample kitchen, dining\r\nroom, sitting room, sleeping and \"observation\" accommodation for us all,\r\nwith an excellent bathroom and the luxury of a shower bath.\r\n\r\nOn all our journeys to and from the Dominions, and in all our expeditions\r\nby sea or by land, my wife accompanied me.  She was an excellent\r\ntraveller.  There is considerable difference in our years; but, as\r\nDickens has said: \"There can be no disparity in marriage save\r\nunsuitability of mind and purpose.\"  The only lady who accompanied the\r\nCommission everywhere, she was sometimes called \"The Lady Commissioner.\"\r\nOne must not praise one's own, but this much I may say: Her Irish wit and\r\nbright unselfish ways made her, everywhere and always, a welcome addition\r\nto the Commission party.\r\n\r\nAfter November, 1916, we held no more public sittings, took no further\r\nevidence, but sat down at Spencer House (one of the many stately London\r\nresidences lent by their owners to the Government during the war) and\r\nthere, in its ballroom, industriously worked out our Final Report.  This,\r\nof course, reviewed the whole subject of our inquiry and embodied our\r\nfinal conclusions and recommendations.  To the credit of the Commission\r\nbe it said, these conclusions and recommendations were entirely\r\nunanimous, as also were those in each of our Interim Reports, published\r\nin connection with the Dominions separately.\r\n\r\nIn this Final Report the subject of railways was not included.  Railways\r\nof course formed part of our inquiry, but they were dealt with in our\r\nInterim Reports.\r\n\r\nTo a large extent railways were more a matter of domestic than of\r\nImperial concern, but as the development of the resources of the\r\nDominions depended greatly upon the adequacy of railway transit, the\r\nsubject came within the province of our inquiry.  I will not trouble the\r\nreader with statistics (which can be readily obtained elsewhere) beyond\r\nthe following statement which represented, at the time we made our\r\ninvestigations, the railway mileage and the population in each Dominion\r\ncompared with the United Kingdom:--\r\n\r\n                     Miles of    Population.   Number of\r\n                     Railway.                 Inhabitants\r\n                                              per Mile of\r\n                                                Railway.\r\nCanada               35,600      8,075,000        280\r\nAustralia            18,000      4,500,000        250\r\nSouth Africa          8,800      1,300,000{207a}  150{207b}\r\nNew Zealand           2,900      1,052,000{207a}  370\r\nNewfoundland            800        250,000        320\r\nUnited Kingdom       23,500     46,000,000      1,950\r\n\r\nIt is clear that railway construction has not been neglected in the\r\nDominions, and that, measured by population, the mileage is considerable.\r\nSpeaking generally, the Dominion railways are highly efficient and serve\r\ntheir purpose well.  Extensions were being projected and many were in\r\ncourse of construction for the further development of natural resources\r\nand of trade and commerce.\r\n\r\nIn Australia the railways, with the exception of certain lines belonging\r\nto the Commonwealth, are owned and worked by the several States.  We\r\nfound them paying full interest on the cost of construction, and sound\r\nassets of the country.  The cost of working was, however, greatly\r\nincreasing, due mainly to increase of salaries and wages.  How this\r\nstands since the war I do not know; but that expenses have further\r\nadvanced goes without saying.  An important railway witness whom we\r\nexamined expressed the opinion that increased expenditure could be\r\nrecouped by increased rates.  Perhaps that is still true.  If it is, the\r\nrailways of Australia are happier than most of the railways in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe railways of New Zealand belong to and are worked by the Government.\r\nFor many years the Government, looking upon the railways as an adjunct to\r\nthe settlement and development of the country, only expected them to\r\nreturn 3 per cent. interest on the capital expended.  In 1909 this\r\npolicy, however, was modified, 3.75 to 4 per cent. being then regarded as\r\na proper result, and this result was accomplished.  Water power in New\r\nZealand is so abundant that the adoption of electricity for railway\r\nworking has been engaging the attention of the Government.  Many, well\r\nqualified to judge, were satisfied that it would prove more economical\r\nthan steam locomotion.\r\n\r\nIn both Australia and New Zealand, borrowing for railway construction had\r\nbeen by means of general loans raised for all kinds of Government\r\nexpenditure.  We came to the conclusion that if loans for reproductive\r\nworks, such as railways, had been segregated from others, it would have\r\nhelped the raising of capital, and probably secured easier terms.\r\n\r\nThe construction of railways in Canada has, in recent years, proceeded at\r\na rapid pace.  We found that the mileage had doubled since the beginning\r\nof the present century, due, to a large extent, to the construction of\r\ntwo new Trans-Continental lines.  The grain-growing districts of the\r\nprairie provinces, south of latitude 54 degrees, are now covered with a\r\nnetwork of railways, and British Columbia has three through routes to\r\nEastern Canada.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise of the principal Canadian railway companies is remarkable.\r\nThey own and operate not only railways, but also hotels, ferry services,\r\ngrain elevators, lake and coast steamers, as well as Trans-Atlantic and\r\nTrans-Pacific steamers.  One company also has irrigation works, and ready-\r\nmade farms for settlers in the prairie provinces.  But Canada lies so\r\nnear to us, and in the British Press its railways receive such constant\r\nattention, that I need not descant further upon them.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, with the exception of about 500 miles mainly in the Cape\r\nProvince, the railways are all Government owned, and are worked as one\r\nunified system.  The Act of Union (1909) prescribed that the railways and\r\nthe harbours (which are also Government owned and worked) were to be\r\nadministered on business principles, and that the total earnings should\r\nnot exceed the necessary expenditure for working and for interest on\r\ncapital.  Whenever they did, reductions in the rates, or the provision of\r\ngreater facilities, were to restore the balance.  This provision also had\r\nthe effect of preventing the imposition of taxation upon the community by\r\nmeans of railway rates.  The Act contained another practical clause,\r\ndesigned to block the construction of lines from political\r\nconsiderations.  Any line constructed contrary to the advice of the\r\nRailway Board, if it resulted in loss, the loss was to be a charge, not\r\nupon the general railway revenue, but upon the Consolidated Fund--a\r\nuseful \"brake,\" which I have no doubt has often pulled up hasty and\r\nimpetuous politicians.\r\n\r\nSouth African railways enjoy one great advantage--cheap coal for their\r\nengines.  In 1913 the average cost at the pit's mouth was 4s. 11.5d. per\r\nton.\r\n\r\nThe railways of Newfoundland have had a chequered history.  Now they are\r\nGovernment property, worked by a private company under a 50 years' lease,\r\nwhich dates from 1901, and under that lease no rent is paid.  As the\r\ncapital expenditure (about 3,000,000 pounds) averages less than 4,000\r\npounds per mile, it may be conceived that the railway system of\r\nNewfoundland is not of an extravagant character, and in my humble\r\nopinion, the country deserves something much better.  In our fourth\r\nreport (on Newfoundland) we stated: \"It must also be said that the state\r\nof the permanent way does not conduce to speedy or comfortable\r\ntravelling.\"\r\n\r\nThe gauges of the Dominions' railways are very varied.  In Australia\r\nthere are three--5ft. 3in., 4ft. 8.5in. and 3ft. 6in., with some 300\r\nmiles or so of less than 3ft. 6in.  The Commonwealth has for some time\r\nbeen considering the conversion of the lines into one standard gauge, the\r\nBritish gauge of 4ft. 8.5in. being favoured.  The cost of this conversion\r\nnaturally increases the longer action is deferred, and in any case would\r\nbe very great.  It was officially estimated at the time of our visit at\r\n37,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand, Canada, South Africa and Newfoundland are each the happy\r\npossessor of one gauge only.  In Canada it is the British gauge of 4ft.\r\n8.5in., and in New Zealand, South Africa and Newfoundland, 3ft. 6in.\r\n\r\nOur Final Report was signed on the 21st of February, 1917, and published\r\nas a Blue Book in the usual way, but, what is rarely done with any Blue\r\nBook, it was also published in handy book-form, bound in cloth, at the\r\npopular price of 1s. 6d.  Blue Books do sometimes contain matter of\r\ngeneral interest, are sometimes well written and readable, and would be\r\nmore read if presented to the public in a handy form such as we succeeded\r\nin publishing.\r\n\r\nThe main purposes of the Commission I have already briefly stated.  They\r\nembraced many subjects for inquiry and study, of which the following are\r\nthe most important, and regarding each of which it may be appropriate to\r\nsay a word or two:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Trade of the Self-Governing Dominions\r\n\r\n\r\nWe ascertained and compiled in detail, tables of the Imports and Exports,\r\ndistinguishing Trade with (_a_) the United Kingdom, (_b_) the other parts\r\nof the Empire, and (_c_) with foreign countries.  The figures showed the\r\nneed there was for an Imperial trade policy, which should lead to British\r\nmanufacturers and merchants cultivating more the Dominion markets, and\r\nutilising more the vast resources of raw materials which the Dominions\r\npossess.  We found that a detailed examination of existing conditions,\r\nand practical and definite proposals for the removal of difficulties,\r\nwere required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural Resources of the Dominions\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to agricultural matters we gathered and published much\r\ninformation, finding that in one part or other of the Dominions all\r\nanimals and almost every crop flourished that are needed by man, that if\r\nthe products of the more tropical parts of the Empire were taken into\r\naccount, the Empire could meet more than its own needs; and that if men\r\nexisted in sufficient numbers in our Dominions, there was scarcely any\r\nlimit to the external trade they could do.  In this part of our Inquiry\r\nwe found to what a considerable extent people concentrated in large\r\ncities to the detriment of the country districts.  \"Back to the land\" is\r\na question there of as much if not greater moment than in the Mother\r\nCountry.  The mineral resources of the Dominions, like the agricultural,\r\nprovided us with a big subject.  In every Province or State, by oral\r\nevidence, by official statistics, by discussion with Government\r\ngeologists, officials of the Mines Departments and others, we gathered a\r\nlarge amount of valuable information.  The volumes of printed evidence\r\ngive full particulars of this and other subjects.  The mineral deposits\r\nof Canada especially are varied in character and large in respect both of\r\nquantity and value--gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, nickel, coal, iron,\r\nasbestos, natural gas, petroleum, peat, gypsum--all are found in\r\nunstinted quantity.  Nor are the other Dominions deficient.  The\r\ngoldfields of Australia are historic, and the silver, lead and zinc mines\r\nof Broken Hill deserve particular mention.  In South Africa gold and\r\ndiamonds are plentiful; and Newfoundland has wonderful deposits of iron\r\nore.\r\n\r\nIn forests and fish the Dominions abound, and possess enormous\r\npossibilities of extended trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConservation and Development of Natural Resources in the Future\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subject received our earnest attention.  We considered that the\r\nvarious Governments of the Empire should take steps to secure the\r\ndevelopment and utilisation of their natural wealth on a well considered\r\nscheme, and that to do this, a preliminary survey was needed of the\r\nrelation between Empire production and Empire requirements.  No such\r\nsurvey, as far as we knew, had yet been undertaken, but in the\r\n_Memorandum and Tables relating to the Food and Raw Material Requirements\r\nof the United Kingdom_, which we submitted to His Majesty in 1915, the\r\nCommission had made an effort, not without some measure of success, in\r\nthis direction.  We regarded it as vital that the Empire's supplies of\r\nraw material and commodities essential to its safety should be, as far as\r\npossible, independent of outside control, and made suggestions which\r\naimed at effecting this object.  We recommended that the survey mentioned\r\nabove should be made by an Imperial Development Board, which should be\r\nentrusted with the whole subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Research in Relation to the Development of Natural Resources\r\n\r\n\r\nWe dwelt on the importance of securing to all parts of the Empire\r\nadequate facilities for scientific research in connection with the\r\ndevelopment of their natural resources; and, in connection with this,\r\nmade certain recommendations as regards the Imperial Institute, for the\r\npurpose of increasing its efficiency and usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMigration\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this important matter we devoted much time and thought, not only in\r\nLondon, but in each of the Dominions as well, obtaining much valuable\r\nevidence and personally examining the circumstances and conditions that\r\nprevailed.  No Imperial question, we considered, could be of greater\r\nimportance than this.  We made many recommendations, some of which have\r\nalready been adopted, whilst the remainder are coming into great\r\nprominence now that the war is over.  In the past we found no effort had\r\nbeen made to regulate emigration from the United Kingdom, and we proposed\r\nthe establishment of a Central Emigration Authority.  The surplus of\r\nfemales in the United Kingdom, increased unfortunately by the war, will\r\nprobably result in many young women seeking their fortune overseas, and\r\nwe urged increased facilities and better regulations for their migration,\r\nshowing how best we considered they could be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOversea Communications\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this subject, which embraced sea transport, harbours, waterways, mail\r\ncommunications, postal rates, freight rates, etc., we devoted\r\nconsiderable time, calling attention in particular to an aspect of the\r\nquestion never, so far as I know, investigated before, viz., the urgency\r\nof constructing deep harbours suited for the deep draught vessels which\r\nalone can carry on cheap and rapid transport.  We made recommendations as\r\nto the improvements immediately necessary on the great trade routes, and\r\nurged that future schemes should be submitted to an Imperial Development\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelegraphic Communications\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the far distant Dominions, cable communication is a matter of great\r\nimportance to the community; and increased facilities and cheaper rates\r\nare much desired.  Some of the recommendations we made to this end have\r\nsince been adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImprovement in Commercial Practice\r\n\r\n\r\nThis presented a large field for inquiry; and, after much investigation,\r\nwe made recommendations on Trade Intelligence; Trade Commissioners and\r\nCorrespondents; Consular Service; Improvements in Statistics; Conference\r\nof United Kingdom and Dominion Statisticians; and other matters, all of\r\nwhich we considered were of practical necessity.\r\n\r\nLastly, the need of creating an _Imperial Development Board_ engaged our\r\nserious attention.  Early in our Inquiry we had been impressed with the\r\nnecessity for the appointment of some board or body whose constant duty\r\nit should be to consider questions affecting Imperial trade and\r\ndevelopment, from the point of view of the interests of the whole Empire.\r\nWe took some evidence on the subject, discussed it with leading men in\r\nthe Dominions, gave the question much thought, and finally recommended\r\nthe establishment of a new Imperial Development Board, which should\r\ninclude not only representatives of the United Kingdom and all the\r\nDominions, but also of India, the Crown Colonies and the Protectorates.\r\nIn the course of our work we had been much impressed with the inadequacy\r\nof existing organisations to deal promptly and efficiently with such\r\nmatters as the following:--\r\n\r\nTelegraphic, cable and shipping communications between the various\r\nportions of the Empire\r\n\r\nInter-Imperial mail services and postal rates\r\n\r\nThe development of harbours and waterways on the great routes of commerce\r\nto meet Imperial requirements\r\n\r\nMigration as a factor in Empire development and trade\r\n\r\nLegislation affecting the mechanism of trade, such as that on patents,\r\ncompanies, copyright, weights and measures, etc.\r\n\r\nThe application and better utilisation of capital raised in the United\r\nKingdom and other parts of the Empire, towards promoting the development\r\nof the Empire's resources\r\n\r\nThe systematic dissemination throughout the Empire of news bearing upon\r\nImperial questions and interests\r\n\r\nThe preparation and publication of Imperial statistics\r\n\r\nBetter organisation for handling and for disposal of the produce of\r\nvarious parts of the Empire\r\n\r\nThese, and subjects of a similar nature, we considered should be assigned\r\nto the proposed Board as its ordinary work; and to the duty of advising\r\nthe Governments on these matters would be added that of collecting the\r\nnecessary particulars bearing upon them, involving research not only into\r\nthe conditions prevailing in the Empire, but into the methods of rival\r\ntrading countries.\r\n\r\nTo a large Board we were opposed.  We suggested that members should be\r\nrequired to give their whole time to the work, and that representation of\r\nthe various parts of the Empire might be as follows:--\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, India, Crown Colonies and Protectorates  7\r\nCanada                                                   1\r\nAustralia                                                1\r\nNew Zealand                                              1\r\nSouth Africa                                             1\r\nNewfoundland                                             1\r\n                                                        ___\r\n                                                        12\r\n                                                        ___\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief summary of our Mission, our Report, and our\r\nRecommendations.\r\n\r\nWhilst we were impressed by the vast extent and infinite variety of the\r\nEmpire domain we were also touched by the sentiment which held together\r\nits widely scattered parts.  Without this sentiment, and without loyalty\r\nto the Crown and Mother Country, what, we often thought, would happen?\r\n\r\nThe war has taught us much as to the unity of the Empire.  Peace, we may\r\nbe sure, will bring its own lessons, perhaps its own dangers, in its\r\ntrain.  To strengthen the bonds so loosely yet so finely drawn must\r\nhenceforth be the constant duty of the Statesmen of the Empire.  The\r\ngoverning machinery requires overhauling, demands adjustment to the needs\r\nof the various sections of the Empire, and to the throbbing anxiety of\r\neach to share in the duties and responsibilities of Empire Government and\r\nDevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1917 terminated our Dominions' Commission work and brought to a\r\nclose the fiftieth year of my railway life.  As if to mark the occasion,\r\nDame Fortune gave me a pleasant surprise, and what it was I will now\r\nrelate.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter I have spoken of the Letterkenny to Burtonport\r\nRailway (in North-West Donegal), with the early stages of which, in 1897,\r\nI had something to do.  Now, in 1917, twenty years later, I was to become\r\nstill more intimately acquainted with it, and, in an unexpected but\r\npractical way, concerned in its domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nThough the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company, which worked the\r\nBurtonport line, was a railway of only 14.5 miles in extent, it was\r\nentrusted with the working of no less than 85 other miles, 50 of which\r\nconsisted of the Burtonport railway--a condition of things quite unique:\r\nthe tail wagging the dog!\r\n\r\nThe total capital expenditure on the whole of the 100 miles of line\r\nworked by the Lough Swilly Company amounted to 727,000 pounds.  Of this\r\nsum about 500,000 pounds, or 68 per cent., was money provided out of\r\nGovernment funds.  The ordinary stock of the Lough Swilly Company was the\r\nexceedingly small sum of 50,330 pounds, upon which for twenty years a\r\ndividend of 7 per cent. had been regularly paid.\r\n\r\nThe Burtonport line was opened for traffic in 1903.  From the first, its\r\nmanagement, to say the least, was faulty and illiberal.  So early in its\r\nhistory as 1905 an inquiry into its working was found to be necessary,\r\nand I was asked by the Board of Works to undertake the inquiry.  I did\r\nso, and I had to report unfavourably, for \"facts are chiels that winna\r\nding.\"  For some time after my report things went on fairly well, but\r\nonly for a time.  The Board of Works were, by Act of Parliament,\r\ncustodians of the public interest in the matter of this and other similar\r\nrailways, and a long-suffering and patient body they were.  From time to\r\ntime they complained, protested, adjured, threatened; sometimes with\r\neffect, sometimes without.  Years rolled on and matters grew worse.  Loud\r\npublic complaints arose; the patience of the Board of Works exhausted\r\nitself, and a climax was reached.\r\n\r\n_The Railways Ireland Act_, 1896, provides that where any railway,\r\nconstructed under that Act, or under other Irish Light Railway Act, had\r\nbeen aided out of moneys provided by Parliament, the Board of Works\r\nmight, at any time, appoint \"a fit person to inspect and report upon the\r\ncondition of the undertaking and the working, maintenance and development\r\nof the same,\" and if such \"fit person\" reported that the undertaking was\r\n\"not efficiently worked, maintained and developed\" the Privy Council\r\nmight then make an Order appointing a manager or receiver of the\r\nundertaking, with such powers as should be specified in the Order.  The\r\npowers thus given are, it will be observed, certainly drastic.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1917, Sir George Stevenson, K.C.B., the Chairman of the Board\r\nof Works, asked me would I make such an inquiry for them into the\r\nBurtonport line, and, considering myself a \"fit person,\" I gladly\r\nanswered _Yes_.  Sir George Stevenson was Tom Robertson's successor,\r\nthough not his immediate successor, as another George (Sir George Holmes)\r\ncame between.  He (the reigning Chairman) was, in 1892, appointed a\r\nCommissioner of the Board of Works; and in 1913 he attained the position\r\nof Chairman; and the chair it is generally conceded has never been better\r\nfilled.  He has the advantage of continuous experience of Treasury\r\nbusiness since 1886, and possesses an exceptional knowledge of all\r\nmatters, local and otherwise, affecting the development of State Railways\r\nin Ireland.\r\n\r\nMy inquiry I may, I am sure, without immodesty, say was thorough and\r\ncomplete.  On the 7th of May I presented my report.  The facts which I\r\nfound were such that only one conclusion was possible--the line was not\r\nin good condition; was not and had not been efficiently worked,\r\nmaintained or developed.  I will not harrow my readers with a description\r\nof its condition.  One little quotation from the summing up in my report\r\nwill suffice to indicate the state of affairs, and, to the imaginative\r\nmind, present a picture of the whole.  \"Everything has for years past\r\nbeen allowed to run down; the direction and management have been\r\ncharacterised by extreme parsimony; and the disabled condition of the\r\nengines is undoubtedly due to lack of proper upkeep, which must have been\r\ngoing on for years.  The state of the permanent way shows a want of\r\nproper maintenance; and the condition of the stations, buildings and of\r\nthe carriages speaks of neglect.\"\r\n\r\nIn fairness, I ought to say that the direction and management responsible\r\nfor these things are not the direction and management that exist to-day.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Hunt, the present General Manager of the Londonderry and Lough\r\nSwilly Company, was appointed to that position in September, 1916.  He\r\ncame from the Great Central Railway.  This is what I said about him in my\r\nreport: \"He is a good railway man, capable and experienced.  He has\r\nassumed and exercises an authority which none of his predecessors\r\npossessed, and is keen to do all he can to improve matters and develop\r\nthe railway.\"  Further acquaintance with Mr. Hunt has more than confirmed\r\nmy high opinion of him.\r\n\r\nIn due time my report was submitted to the Privy Council, which august\r\nbody, after hearing all that was to be said on the subject by the Lough\r\nSwilly Railway Company and others, made an Order which is the first of\r\nits kind--an Order which, for a period of two years, took out of the\r\nhands of the Lough Swilly Railway Directors the management of the\r\nBurtonport Railway, and placed it in the hands of Mr. Hunt, subject to my\r\nsupervision.  The Order said: \"Henry Hunt, at present the General Manager\r\nof the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company, is hereby appointed\r\nManager of the said undertaking of the said railway under and subject to\r\nthe supervision of Mr. Joseph Tatlow, Director of the Midland Great\r\nWestern Railway Company of Ireland.\"  Then followed various clauses\r\ndefining the duties and authority with which Mr. Hunt, as Manager, was\r\ninvested.\r\n\r\nThis appointment, to supervise, under the Privy Council, the management\r\nof the Burtonport line, was the pleasant surprise which Dame Fortune\r\nbrought me in my fiftieth year of railway work.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the office began on the 1st of July, 1917, and the two\r\nyears prescribed have expired; but Mr. Hunt's management and my\r\nsupervision have, by Privy Council Order, been extended for a further\r\nperiod.  My story may not go beyond fifty years, but this I may say, that\r\nwhat Hunt and I were able to accomplish in the first six months of our\r\nnovel _regime_ was an augury of what we have accomplished since, and that\r\na grateful public throughout the district of North-West Donegal, which\r\nthe Burtonport Railway serves, does not stint its praise.  Trains are\r\npunctual now, engines do not break down, carriages are comfortable, goods\r\ntraffic is well worked, and delays are exceptional.  Much has been done,\r\nmore would have been done but for difficulties due to the war, and a good\r\ndeal still remains to be done.\r\n\r\nIn North-West Donegal, some two years ago, the idea of writing this book\r\nwas conceived, and with North-West Donegal its pages close.  As I lay\r\ndown my pen, some words which I used in my opening chapter recur to my\r\nmind.
