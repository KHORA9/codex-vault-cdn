Cambridge indeed does not appear to suggest,\r\ndoes not lend itself to, the numberless little brochures or hymns of\r\npraise which accompany the honoured years of the sister university; in\r\nweighty tomes and valuable _collectanea_ of MSS., however, it possesses\r\nworks (such as Cooper’s Annals, the Cole and Baker MSS., and Willis and\r\nClark’s Architectural History) not possessed by Oxford and unrivalled,\r\nperhaps, by any English town.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of last century the invaluable Fuller was the most readily\r\naccessible authority, but the last thirty years have seen the\r\npublication of the monumental work of Messieurs Willis and Clark, and of\r\nthe History of the University by Mr. J. Bass Mullinger, while at the\r\nsame time the slighter literature of the subject has not been\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there is room, I hope, for a short book on the present\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nIt is, I believe, the first time that a chapter on the women’s colleges\r\nhas anywhere appeared, and certainly the first time that such a chapter\r\nforms part of an account of the University. I have taken pains to\r\nauthenticate the description here given, for events which occurred\r\nthirty--even twenty--years back are now fading out of remembrance and\r\nsome of those who took part in them are no longer with us.\r\n\r\nA first and last chapter on the origin of universities and on the sister\r\nuniversities have been omitted for the purposes of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe pleasantest part of my task still remains to be performed--to thank\r\nall those, both in and out of Cambridge, who have kindly afforded me\r\nfacilities, have obtained information on innumerable points, or\r\nlightened my labours by lending books. In addition to this welcome\r\nassistance my thanks are specially due to Mr. J. Willis Clark, late\r\nfellow of Trinity, and Registrary of the University, for sparing time to\r\nread the proof sheets of Chapters I. and II.--for sparing time and not\r\nsparing trouble; to the Master of Peterhouse and to Dr. A. W. Verrall\r\n(fellow and late tutor of Trinity) for reading the proof sheets of\r\nportions of Chapter II. and portions of Chapter III.; to Mr. C. W. Moule\r\nfellow and librarian of Corpus Christi, Mr. Ellis H. Minns\r\nassistant-librarian, and late fellow, of Pembroke, to Miss M. G.\r\nKennedy, and to the Mistress of Girton; to the Assistant Keeper of MSS.\r\nat the British Museum, and the Librarian at Lambeth; to Lord Francis\r\nHervey and Sir Ernest Clarke who kindly supplied some annotated\r\nreferences to the school at Bury from the Curteys Register, and last but\r\nnot least to the Rev. H. F. Stewart (chaplain of Trinity) and Mrs.\r\nStewart, the former of whom has been good enough to read portions of the\r\nproof sheets of Chapter IV.\r\n\r\nFor any opinions expressed I am, of course, alone responsible.\r\n\r\nM.

It is this auspicious\r\ncombination which nourished for over a hundred years the university\r\nspirit before universities, carried through Alcuin this spirit to the\r\nContinent, and eventually brought learning hand in hand with\r\nChristianity to Germany. Whatever may be true as to the distribution of\r\ntalent in England later in its history, in the vii and viii centuries\r\nour great school was to be found at York, and England’s learned men\r\nhailed from the kingdom of Northumbria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The School of York.\r\n\r\nYork and Rome.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 657.]\r\n\r\nThe School of York originated in the school established by Hild for the\r\nCeltic clan community over which she presided; and Caedmon the first\r\nEnglish poet, John of Beverley, Wilfrid of York, Bede the father of\r\nEnglish learning, and the scholar Alcuin who has been called “minister\r\nof Public Instruction to Charlemagne” were the noble fruit it put forth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 664.]\r\n\r\nIts history was determined at the Synod of Whitby where Hild appears as\r\nthe link between the Celtic Aidan and the Roman Wilfrid, a\r\nrepresentative figure of the genius of English religion. She had been\r\nbaptized by Paulinus but her sympathies were with the Scottish Church.\r\nThe victory of Wilfrid did not destroy that dual character of English\r\nChristianity which accompanied its mind and its liturgy to the last days\r\nof the religious domination of Rome in the realm; but through this\r\nvictory York again entered the hegemony of Latin civilisation, was bound\r\nafresh to the overshadowing tradition of Rome, and thenceforth sealed\r\nwith an European character its schools of learning.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: York and Canterbury.]\r\n\r\nAnd through York Rome again takes possession of England. In the vii\r\ncentury Christianity in Kent had ceased to be the Christianity of\r\nAugustine; with the fall of Edwin Northumbria forgot the Christianity of\r\nPaulinus; but the immediate result of the Roman victory at York was the\r\nmission of Theodore to Canterbury, where the episcopal school he\r\ninaugurated shared the honours though it never rivalled the learning of\r\nthe School of York.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: York and Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nThe legends which relate that Bede came to study at Cambridge in 682,\r\nthat Alcuin was one of its first doctors in theology, and that Alfred of\r\nBeverley, “the Treasurer,” studied there, legends already known in the\r\ntime of Chaucer, symbolise the spiritual relationship between the School\r\nof York and Cambridge. Those large elements which had operated at\r\nYork--that combination of the shaping power of Rome with the insular\r\nforce of Angle, Celt, and Saxon--had in them the promise of the English\r\ngenius and the English character; and one seems to trace the same wide\r\ntradition, the operation of similarly large elements, in the future seat\r\nof learning at Cambridge. The university of Chaucer, Spenser, and\r\nMilton, of Fox, Fisher, and Langton, of Ascham, Bacon, Newton, Whewell,\r\nand Lightfoot, may well be regarded as the spiritual descendant of the\r\nSchool which first held the torch of English learning never again to be\r\nentirely extinguished in this country.[1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early legends of the origin of Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nFurther down, in the east of England, there in fact existed a still\r\nearlier school than the schools at York, established in 635 by Siegebert\r\nking of East Anglia. The site of this school was very probably Seaham or\r\nDunwich; but legend connects it with Cambridge, and the memory of King\r\nSiegebert is kept green in the annual commemorations of the\r\nuniversity.[2] A legend referring to the same period connects Cambridge\r\nwith Canterbury. According to this, Ethelbert of Kent by the command of\r\nGregory the Great assigned a residence at Cambridge for some learned men\r\nfrom “the village of Canterbury” (598-604).\r\n\r\nLegend also relates that Edward the Elder founded the Cambridge schools\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 910.]\r\n\r\nwhen he was repairing the ravages of the Danes in East Anglia, and gave\r\nto them a charter of incorporation.\r\n\r\nThe fact not only that the neighbourhood of Cambridge, like Canterbury\r\nand York, was the site of an early Anglo-Saxon school, but that\r\nCambridge was itself a Roman station, gave rise in its turn to another\r\nlegend of the origin of the university. According to this it was founded\r\nby Cantaber the son-in-law of King Gurgentius and brother of Partholin\r\nthe Spanish king of Ireland, who gave his name to it, a name, no doubt,\r\nformed from the _Cantabri_, the Spanish auxiliaries mentioned by Caesar.\r\nLydgate’s panegyric of the university shows us that a tradition of its\r\nantiquity made up of both Roman and School of York elements received\r\ncredence in the xiv century; nay, remembering that Cambridge had been a\r\nRoman town, men found no difficulty in supposing that Caesar had carried\r\noff a supply of Cambridge dons to the capital of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORMAN CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE\r\n\r\nBelieved to be the oldest of the four round Churches in England, built\r\nabout 1120-40.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The town of Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nThe Roman fortress lay on the left bank of the river, at the hamlet of\r\nGrantchester (_Granta_, _castrum_); the town of Cambridge proper, on the\r\nsame bank, being called _Grantabrigge_. Here it was that William the\r\nConqueror’s castle was built on the site of a British earthwork still\r\nknown as Castle Mound, and here British as well as Roman coins and other\r\nRoman remains have been discovered. The British town of Cair-Graunth has\r\nbeen identified with both sites; while the Roman station marked in Saxon\r\nmaps as _Camboritum_ or _Camboricum_ has hitherto been confounded with\r\nthe site of the Norman fortress. We do not know where Camboricum was,\r\nbut we no longer identify it with Cambridge.[3]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Bede, and earlier, Grantchester was a desolate ruin,[4]\r\nbut Grantabridge was a place of some importance at the time of the\r\nDomesday survey, and we find that nearly thirty of its four hundred\r\nhouses were destroyed to make room for William’s castle.[5] The town\r\nwhich is still called Grantabridge in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in\r\nDomesday, and in Henry I.’s charter, becomes Cantebruge before the\r\nmiddle of the xii century, and Cantebrigge in Chaucer.[6]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roman roads.]\r\n\r\nTwo great Roman roads met near the Castle Mound, the one being the only\r\nway across the pathless fens, running from the coast of Norfolk through\r\nEly to Cambridge and thence on to Cirencester and Bath; the other--_via\r\nDevana_--was the great highway (along the site of the present Huntingdon\r\nroad) which led from Cambridge out of the fen country, stretching from\r\nChester[7] on the north-west to Colchester on the south-east. This road\r\ncrossed the only high ground in the flat country round Cambridge--the\r\nlow range of hills called the Gogmagogs and Castle Mound itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The river.]\r\n\r\nThe river Granta gave its name to the British and Roman towns\r\n(Cair-Graunth, Grantchester), to the university city, and to the whole\r\nshire. The Granta or Cam, for it is now called by both names, is made by\r\nthe confluence of two small streams which meet beyond Grantchester; the\r\neastern branch, the Granta, rising in Cambridgeshire, the western, the\r\nRhee, in Hertfordshire. What other river in England can boast that it\r\nhas been celebrated by our poets in every age? For Milton it is _Camus_,\r\nfor Byron _Granta_, both names serve the muse of Gray; it is\r\nWordsworth’s _Cam_, but Spenser calls it _Guant_, and also _Ouse_, the\r\nname it takes before reaching Ely, although the waters of the “plenteous\r\nOuse” join the Granta much lower down.[8]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ford.]\r\n\r\nThe important thing about the river, which determined the history of the\r\ntown on its banks, was that between Grantabridge and Grantchester it was\r\nfordable, and here only could it be traversed by those going to and from\r\nthe east of England and the Midlands. Near Trumpington, indeed, a part\r\nof the Via Devana had been carried by the Romans right through the\r\nwater.[9]\r\n\r\nIn the ix century the province of Cambridge--the _Flavia Caesariensis_\r\nof the Romans--formed part of the Danelagh.[10] Throughout the middle\r\nages, writes Mr. J. W. Clark, the town “was a frontier fortress on the\r\nedge of the great wild ... which stretched as far as the Wash”: and no\r\nplace suffered more from invasion and fire. The Danes completely\r\ndestroyed it in 870, after the capture of York; and the fortunes of the\r\ntwo cities were again linked two hundred years later when William, fresh\r\nfrom the reduction of the northern capital, turned\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1068-1070.]\r\n\r\nhis steps to Cambridge and made it the centre of his operations against\r\nthe outstanding isle of Ely. A second destruction at the hands of the\r\nDanes occurred in 1010, and in 1088 Cambridge was again devastated with\r\nthe rest of Cambridgeshire by Robert Curthose. This, however, led to a\r\nvigorous re-instatement of the city by Henry I. who showed it many marks\r\nof favour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1102.]\r\n\r\nIn the second year of his reign he ordered the townsmen to pay their\r\ndues to the bedells, and about this time the ferry which had hitherto\r\nbeen “a vagrant ... even anywhere where passengers could get waftage\r\nover,”[11] was established at Cambridge, bringing traffic in its train.\r\nIn 1106 the first signs of returning prosperity were seen in the\r\nsettlement of the Jews. The Cambridge Jewry was near the market-place,\r\nand the Cambridge Jews were noted for their “civil carriage,” none of\r\nthe customary outrageous charges\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1118.]\r\n\r\nbeing brought against them there.[12] Twelve years later, the king gave\r\na charter to the burgesses.\r\n\r\nCambridge was at no period of its history a great or even a prosperous\r\ncommercial centre. East Anglia has always been a corner of England to\r\nitself, not on the direct line to anywhere, and offering very few points\r\nof vantage to the statesman or the merchant. The course of a river\r\ndetermines the history of a town, as it first determines its site. This\r\nis well exemplified in the histories of the Granta and the “Isis.” The\r\n“Isis” is a reach of the Thames,[13] and this fact with its moral\r\npolitical and commercial implications has coloured the whole history of\r\nthe town on its banks--everything came to Oxford by the river from\r\nLondon, and dignified alderman or humble bargeman shared with the lesser\r\ncentre the life of the greater. The Granta and Ouse have a history in\r\nevery sense the opposite of this. Through the centuries, long before\r\nOxford was a town at all,[14] the sounds we hear are the thud of the\r\nEly barge as it strikes the bank of deserted Grantchester, and\r\nSexberga’s messengers borrow from the neighbourhood of the future\r\nuniversity the sepulture for the founder of Ely--the gift of a\r\ncivilisation still older than hers.[15] Or, three hundred and fifty\r\nyears later, the chant of the Ely monks is wafted out upon the water as\r\nCanute bids his men rest a moment on their oars to listen\r\n\r\n    Merrily sang the monks of Ely when Canute the king rowed by.\r\n\r\nThe convent messenger, the Danish king, the Norman conqueror, may come\r\nup the water, but they make the stir they find, and the river leaves no\r\ntrace behind them.\r\n\r\nSo the university town owes nothing to adventitious causes; makes no bid\r\nfor public favour, and has no tentacles to put forth to obtain it. But\r\nthe river has, nevertheless, determined its activities as well as its\r\nreticences. It will give rise to a fair, and Stourbridge fair will\r\nbecome one of the greatest fairs in the kingdom. The fish market was\r\nanother source of traffic. Ely and Cambridge fish were celebrated--Bede,\r\nindeed, derives “Ely” from the abundance of its eels, although _helyg_\r\n(the willow) seems the more\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARKET SQUARE\r\n\r\nThis picture represents what is called Half Market, which takes place on\r\nWednesday. Market day, properly speaking, is on Saturday, when the\r\nsquare is filled with stalls. The church is Great St. Mary’s, and King’s\r\nCollege Chapel is seen in the distance on the left.]\r\n\r\nprobable original.[16] The kings of England patronised this market,\r\nHenry III. sending for his fish to Cambridge even when he was staying at\r\nOxford; and Chaucer is careful to note that the Cambridge miller was an\r\nangler, skilled in mending his nets.[17] The isle of Ely, so-called\r\nbecause cut off by river and mere from the rest of Cambridgeshire, was\r\nproverbial for the turbulence of its population, and the men of Ely drew\r\nthe men of Cambridge into their quarrels, or harried them on their own\r\naccount. Cambridge Castle was built as an outpost against the English\r\nearls who with Hereward resisted the Conqueror at Ely; it was at Ely\r\nthat another determined stand was made by Simon de Montfort’s followers\r\nafter Cambridge had been regained for John; and Henry III. had to bring\r\nrelief to the university town when its neighbours burnt and plundered it\r\nduring the years 1266-1270. The two centres were inseparable for weal or\r\nwoe, and the intellectual as well as the political life of Cambridge was\r\ncoloured for centuries by the activities of its neighbour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fen monasteries.]\r\n\r\nThe proximity of the great fen monasteries must be reckoned as the chief\r\nfactor in the earlier scholastic--the pre-university--history of\r\nCambridge. Ely, Crowland, Bury-St.-Edmund’s and Peterborough were among\r\nthe most important and the most ancient religious houses in the country.\r\nCrowland and Bury both had abbey schools influenced, as we shall see, in\r\nthe early xii century by the famous school at Orléans; Ely had besides\r\nan episcopal school, and as monastery, school, and cathedral, was in\r\nconstant domestic relations with her neighbour of Cambridge.[18]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crowland.]\r\n\r\nAmong these famous houses, surrounded by undrained marshes, like\r\nislands, forbidding and yet inviting access, none was more isolated than\r\nCrowland which, reared as Venice upon piles and stakes driven into the\r\nmarshy ground, shone like a beacon out of the mysterious silence and\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1109.]\r\n\r\nThe story that abbot Joffred of Crowland sent four Orléans monks full of\r\nnew learning to his Cambridge manor of Cottenham[19] early in the xii\r\ncentury, who held disputations in a large barn, has been shown to be\r\nentirely legendary. Yet the moment chosen by the self-styled continuator\r\nof Ingulph is singularly felicitous.[20] We know nothing of any sources\r\nof information which may have been open to a xiv century forger; but it\r\nis certain that some such scholastic movements were fermenting in\r\nCambridge in the xii century. Joffred had been prior at Orléans which\r\nwas a flourishing school, and we have evidence that this school actually\r\ninfluenced the university of Cambridge. The abbey house of Crowland was\r\nburnt in 1091 and the rebuilding was not undertaken till 1113. It was\r\nlikely enough that the abbot should look out for something for his\r\nlearned monks to do, and should make use of an outlying manor near to\r\nsuch a centre as Cambridge as a promising field for activities\r\nrestricted through the disaster to his house. Moreover the energies of\r\nthe lecturers, we are told, were directed against Jewish doctrines, and\r\nthe Jews, as we have seen, had come to Cambridge three years before. The\r\ntown was rising in prosperity, and the charter of 1118 points to the\r\nconclusion that people and trade had been attracted to it since Henry’s\r\nfirst rescript sixteen years earlier.[21]\r\n\r\nWhether among those attracted to Cambridge we are to count the large\r\ninflux of scholars who are said to have listened to the Crowland monks,\r\nor not, it is certain that Cambridge became once more in 1174 the\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1174.]\r\n\r\ntheatre of great disaster, and a destructive fire was only stayed when\r\nit could find no more fuel to feed it.[22]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The school of glomery.]\r\n\r\n_Soi-disant_ Peter of Blois declares that the monks when they set about\r\nteaching “took the university of Orléans for their pattern.”[23] The\r\nearliest school we come across at Cambridge is a “school of glomery”\r\nunder the patronage of the bishops of Ely. The archdeacon of Ely\r\nnominated the “master of the glomerels” and one of the chief acts of\r\nHugh de Balsham was to limit the authority which the archdeaconry had\r\nthus come indirectly to exercise in university matters. From\r\nthenceforward the master of glomery is to have the same authority to\r\ncompose disputes between glomerels as other regent masters had towards\r\ntheir scholars; but in disputes with scholars or with townsmen as to\r\nlodgings or in grave matters affecting the jurisdiction of the\r\nuniversity, the glomerels were to plead before the chancellor. There\r\nwere thus two classes of students in the early days at Cambridge,\r\n‘glomerels’ and ‘scholars.’ The former were subject to the _magister\r\nglomeriae_ who in his turn was subject to the archdeacon of Ely; the\r\nlatter had grown up under the aegis of the regent masters and\r\nchancellor.\r\n\r\nNow the school of glomery was nothing else than the time-honoured\r\nCambridge school of grammar.[24] The word has been for centuries a\r\nlocal term known only here, and it is therefore the more interesting to\r\nfind that the students of Orléans were called ‘glomerel clerks’ (_clers\r\nglomeriaus_) and that they resisted the invasion of their grammar\r\nschools by Aristotle’s logic in the xiii century.\r\n\r\n    Paris et Orliens ce sont ij:\r\n    C’est granz domages et granz deuls\r\n    Que li uns à l’autre n’acorde.\r\n    Savez por qui est la descorde?\r\n    Qu’il ne sont pas d’une science:\r\n    Car Logique, qui toz jors tence,\r\n    Claime les auctors autoriaus\r\n    Et les clers d’Orliens glomeriaus.[25]\r\n\r\nThere were also ‘glomerels’ at Bury-St.-Edmund’s and Abbot Sampson’s\r\ndoings as regards the grammar school there in the xii century bear a\r\nstrong resemblance to Balsham’s doings at Cambridge in the xiiith.[26]\r\nThe persistence of the glomery school at Cambridge and the equally\r\nremarkable persistence of this school at Orléans goes far to justify the\r\nconjecture that it was Orléans which influenced Cambridge, not Paris:\r\nfor Crowland had certainly been influenced by the same school, and\r\nCambridge and Bury were both familiar with ‘glomerels’; the former under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the diocesan the latter under that of the abbot.[27]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The religious orders. The canons.]\r\n\r\nCambridge presents us with an excellent example of the relations which\r\nsecular and religious learning bore to one another in the foundation of\r\nuniversities. Ecclesiastically it was of no importance whatever; it was\r\nnot the seat of a bishop nor the fief of abbot or prior--the one\r\nmonastic house was the nunnery of S. Rhadegund, founded before the\r\nmiddle of the xii century--and at no time in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD GATEWAY OF KING’S COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThis gateway now forms the entrance to the Library from Trinity Lane.\r\nThe North door of King’s Chapel is seen in the distance.]\r\n\r\nits history was the fate of the university determined by the learning of\r\nthe cloister or its fortune raised by a doctrine of the schools. Ely,\r\nthe outside influence which played the largest rôle, introduced no\r\nmonastic elements, and within Cambridge itself the communities which had\r\nmost part in its development were the canons, and canons always\r\nrepresented a half-way house between clerk and monk. If their\r\ncontribution to European learning be altogether inferior to that of the\r\nBenedictine, they at no time showed any desire to impose a tradition or\r\nto stamp with their own hall mark the scholars who willingly attached\r\nthemselves to canonical houses. The earliest community of canons in\r\nCambridge was founded by a Norman, Hugolina wife to Picot Sheriff of the\r\ncounty, in 1092, in gratitude for her recovery from sickness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1092]\r\n\r\nIt was a foundation for six secular canons serving her church of S.\r\nGiles by the Castle, and the little community was transformed, twenty\r\nyears later, by\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1112.]\r\n\r\nanother Norman, Pain Peverel standard-bearer to the Duke of Normandy,\r\ninto the Canons Regular of Barnwell under the rule of S. Augustine.[28]\r\nThe six canons became thirty, and Barnwell Priory, on the other side of\r\nthe river, became a house of considerable importance, and gave\r\nhospitality to Richard II. during the Cambridge parliament of 1388. It\r\ncontinued to exist till the Suppression. About 1135 a second canons’\r\nhouse was established on the present site of S. John’s College. This was\r\na hospital, or travellers’ hospice, designed by a Cambridge burgess,\r\nHenry Frost, who gave the plot of land and endowed “a master and poor\r\nbrethren of the rule of S. Austin” to dispense the charity of the\r\nhouse.[29] If the Barnwell canons of S. Giles were among the earliest\r\nfriends of the scholars, the canons of the hospice of S. John were to\r\nplay the most important part in their history.[30] S. John’s and the\r\nother xii century foundation of S. Rhadegund were dissolved under\r\nsimilar circumstances within thirteen years of one another, the latter\r\nin 1497 the former in 1510.[31]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gilbertine canons of Sempringham.]\r\n\r\nThere was a third community of Canons Regular at Cambridge. The\r\nLincolnshire community founded by S. Gilbert of Sempringham in the xii\r\ncentury settled near Peterhouse in 1291. Their hostel “S. Edmund’s” took\r\nits name from the old chapel dedicated to the martyr-king enshrined at\r\nBury-St.-Edmund’s, and a licence of Edward III.’s permitting the canons\r\nto acquire houses and lands in the town styles them “the Prior and\r\nCanons of the chapel of S. Edmund.” We hear of these possessions early\r\nin the xiv century when (in 1417) the Prior of S. Edmund’s leases land;\r\nand again in 1474 when the community sell land to William Bassett. Of\r\nthe 26 houses of this Order--the only Order of English origin--there\r\nwere two in the isle of Ely,[32] while a fourth was established near\r\nHitchin. The Barnwell Memoranda announcing their arrival in Cambridge\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1291.]\r\n\r\nsay: “The canons of Sempringham first came to dwell at the chapel of S.\r\nEdmund, and earnestly set about hearing lectures and attending\r\ndisputations.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Friars. Carmelites.]\r\n\r\nThe four orders of friars were all represented in Cambridge, and all\r\nsettled there in the course of the xiii century. The Carmelites or\r\nWhitefriars were the first to arrive, settling in 1200 at\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1249.]\r\n\r\nChesterton near the town, then at Newnham, and finally in Mill Street\r\n(1291). For nearly a hundred years the Carmelites took no part in the\r\nacademic life of Cambridge. They refused to graduate, and showed no\r\ndesire to display the insignia of a secular doctorate over the\r\npeculiarly sacred habit of their Order. It was, indeed, at Cambridge\r\nthat S. Simon Stock had had, in 1251, his vision of the Blessed Virgin,\r\nand had received from her hands the celebrated “scapular of Our Lady of\r\nMount Carmel”; and it was not till forty years after this that the\r\nCarmelite Humphrey Necton, at the urgent instance of the then chancellor\r\nof the university, consented to take the degree of Doctor in\r\nTheology.[33] In the reign of Richard II. this was the richest religious\r\nhouse in Cambridge, and Edmund Langley Earl of Cambridge and Courtney\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury lodged there during the parliament of 1388. The\r\nCambridge Carmelites put forth several eminent men: Bale, the historian,\r\nhad been a Carmelite at Norwich before proceeding to the university;\r\nWalter Diss, a zealous opponent of the Lollards, was confessor to that\r\nfriend of Cambridge John of Gaunt; Nicholas Cantilupe (1441) wrote the\r\n_Historiola Cantabrigiae_,[34] and friar Nicholas Kenton was chancellor\r\nof the university as late as the middle of the xv century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Franciscans.]\r\n\r\nThe Franciscans, or Greyfriars, came to Cambridge soon after their\r\narrival in England, and during the lifetime of S. Francis. Among the\r\nnine friars who landed in 1224 there were three Englishmen, Richard\r\nIngworth (the only friar in priest’s orders), who was accompanied\r\nprobably by another East Anglian, and by Richard of Devon. This East\r\nAnglian element among the first Franciscans is noteworthy, for the first\r\nFranciscan readers in divinity at both universities hailed from our\r\nEastern counties. The Cambridge burgesses established the friars at the\r\nJewish synagogue next to the prison.[35] These uncomfortable quarters\r\nwere exchanged later for a site in the present Sidney Street, where\r\nEdward I. built them a friary. Here they took part and share in the life\r\nof the university: the novices and younger brethren studied and\r\ngraduated, the elder taught; while the church of the Franciscans, which\r\nwas one of the finest buildings in the town, served the purposes of a\r\nuniversity church before the rebuilding of Great S. Mary’s.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dominicans.]\r\n\r\nThe Dominicans, or Blackfriars, did not reach Cambridge till about the\r\nlast quarter of the xiii century,[36] fifty years after the Franciscans.\r\nA strange destiny decreed that a house which had once been under the\r\npatronage of the seraphic Francis should nurture Oliver Cromwell and\r\nbecome the first Protestant college; and that the house of “the Lord’s\r\nWatchdogs” (_Dominicanes_) should become the front and centre of\r\nPuritanism in the university.[37]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austinfriars.]\r\n\r\nThe last to arrive were the Austinfriars, who entered Cambridge in 1290,\r\nat the same time as the Sempringham canons, just as the first Carmelite\r\ntook his university degree, and as the Jews were expelled from the town.\r\nThe priory was behind the present college of Corpus Christi, occupying\r\npart of the site of the Botanical Gardens, where the new museums now\r\nstand. Here was nurtured Miles Coverdale whose reforming principles were\r\nimbibed from its prior Barnes afterwards burned as a heretic.[38] Like\r\nthe other Cambridge friars, the Austinfriars were dissolved at the\r\nReformation.[39]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other friars at Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nThere were other friars in Cambridge. The friars of the Sack[40] or _De\r\npoenitentia Jesu_, were established in S. Mary’s parish in 1291, then\r\nin the parish of S. Peter. This was one of the spurious orders of\r\nFranciscans suppressed, as a result of the Council of Lyons, in 1307.\r\nThe Barnwell Chartulary, however, has recorded for us that “these\r\nbrethren of the Sack gathered together many scholars and good, and\r\nmultiplied exceedingly until the time of the Council of Lyons.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other religious houses at Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nThe Bethlemite friars came over here in 1257, and appear to have had\r\nonly one house in England, that in Trumpington Street.[41]\r\nOur-Lady-friars (_Fratres de Domina_) are first heard of about thirty\r\nyears later (1288). They were settled near the castle (and are hence\r\ncalled in the Barnwell Chartulary: _Fratres beatae Mariae ad Castrum_)\r\nand are only heard of at Cambridge and at Norwich where they arrived\r\nbefore 1290 and were there established at the time of the plague.[42]\r\nThe Cambridge burgesses had an ancient leper hospital at Stourbridge,\r\nunder the dedication of “S. Mary Magdalene for lepers.” In the closing\r\nyears of the xiv century Henry Tangmer, alderman of the Guild of Corpus\r\nChristi, founded the Hermitage of S. Anne and Hospital of Lazars. About\r\nthe same time (1395) the Benedictine nuns of S. Leonard of\r\nStratford-le-Bowe granted a curtilage in Scholars’ Lane to the\r\nuniversity.[43] The Priories of Anglesey S. John of Jerusalem and Tyltey\r\nand the abbeys of Crowland (p. 12) and Denney all held land in\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nThe prior and convent of Anglesey, a Cambridgeshire house of Regular\r\nCanons, owned land here as early as 1278-9, and were of some importance\r\nin the town in the xiv century.[44] The land held by the knights of S.\r\nJohn was not part of the confiscated Templar property, all of which\r\nescheated to the Order, but was purchased by them early in the reign of\r\nEdward I.[45] It lay in the university centre between Mill Street and\r\nSchool Street (“Milnestrete alias Seynt Johnstrete”) and was a parcel of\r\nopen land on which was their patronal church of S. John Baptist, and\r\nCrouched or S. Crosse’s Hostel.[46] In 1432 William Hulle, preceptor of\r\nSwenefeld, Templecombe, and Quenyngton, and prior of the English Langue,\r\nsold this ground to the university for the schools quadrangle, and the\r\nNew Schools of Canon Law were built upon it.[47] The\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. JOHN’S COLLEGE GATEWAY AND TOWER FROM TRINITY STREET\r\n\r\nTrinity Chapel is seen on the left behind the trees.]\r\n\r\nknights’ property was on the west of the schools quadrangle, the\r\nproperty of the nuns of Stratford-le-Bowe on the east. Denney and Tyltey\r\nboth owned land on the site of Christ’s Pieces and elsewhere in the xv\r\ncentury. The former was a Franciscan nunnery founded by Marie de\r\nChatillon Countess of Pembroke (p. 69) on land which was claimed from\r\nher by the knights of S. John as part of the sequestrated Templar\r\nproperty. It lay on the borders of the fen between Cambridge and Ely.\r\nThe latter was a Cistercian house in Essex.[48]\r\n\r\nThe rôle reserved for these houses and congregations in the earlier\r\nhistory of the university was subordinate. By the time that every\r\nBenedictine house was required by the Constitution of Honorius III.\r\n(1216-1227) to send some of its students to the universities, learning\r\nhad already passed from the monastery to the university, and the monks’\r\nhostel at Cambridge[49] signalised the change. The part taken by the\r\nfriars is not less instructive. The refusal of the Carmelites\r\n(throughout the xiii century) to pursue the academic course is valuable\r\nevidence of the conflict between secular and religious studies at the\r\nrise of the university. The Franciscans were the most important of the\r\nmendicants in England, and as such took a paramount place at both\r\nCambridge and Oxford; but at the former their action was inconspicuous,\r\nand there is nothing to indicate that they were at any time or in any\r\nsense “nursing fathers” to Cambridge university whatever they may have\r\nbeen elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe moment when they made their appearance was at least as propitious\r\nhistorically as it had been at Oxford, and the independent growth of\r\nCambridge, its escape from the intellectual thraldom of that\r\nscholasticism of which the Franciscans were the chief exponents, are\r\nhence doubly significant. The quarrels which arose in the early xiv\r\ncentury between the officials of the university and the friars prove\r\nthat the religious societies which shared its academic life did by no\r\nmeans act in permanent harmony with it. Thus in 1303 the chancellor\r\nquarrelled with the Franciscans and Dominicans and excommunicated two of\r\nthe friars, and later in the century the university had to prohibit\r\nnovices in the Cambridge friaries from proceeding to their degrees under\r\neighteen years of age. Then, as now, the Franciscans were accustomed to\r\nrecruit very little lads for the noviciate, all of whom probably\r\nreceived their education at the public Cambridge schools of grammar and\r\ntheology, and might be seen strutting about as full-fledged “masters of\r\narts before they were masters of themselves.”[50]\r\n\r\nBefore the xiii century closed--from the date of Hugh de Balsham’s\r\ndeath--the university ceased to receive any help from monastic learning,\r\nfor the monks avoided Cambridge, and even Norwich priory sent its\r\nstudents to Oxford.[51] Less than a hundred years elapsed, and we find\r\nGaunt, Pembroke, and Scrope--the court party--opposing the pretensions\r\nand the temporalities of the clergy in the company of Cambridge men.\r\nPembroke--the representative of the house of Valence[52]--is their\r\nspokesman, and it is Scrope\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1371.]\r\n\r\nand Sir Robert Thorpe, Master of a Cambridge college, who take the Purse\r\nand the Seals from the hands of their episcopal holders Brantingham and\r\nWilliam of Wykeham. This movement, as Stubbs points out, was independent\r\nof Wyclif’s; and it is remarkable that while William of Wykeham was\r\ninfluencing Oxford the theories for which he stood were being repulsed\r\nat Cambridge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cambridge and the jurisdiction of Ely.]\r\n\r\nThere remains the relation of the university to the see of Ely. The\r\nepiscopal jurisdiction of Ely in the university did not long survive the\r\nbuilding of colleges. The scholars refused to plead in the archdeacon’s\r\ncourt, and Balsham upheld them--their statutes already provided as\r\nmuch.[53] Bishop Montacute also set limits to diocesan authority.[54] In\r\n1317 John XXII. withdrew the university from the spiritual jurisdiction\r\nnot only of the diocesan but of the provincial archbishop; but it was\r\nthe friction arising from the failure of some of the bishops of Ely to\r\nrecognise the spiritual independence of the chancellor which resulted in\r\nthe celebrated court held at Barnwell priory at the instance of Martin\r\nV., in 1430, under the presidency of its prior. Two forged bulls of\r\nHonorius and Sergius[55] were cited as vii century evidence of the\r\nspiritual liberties of Cambridge, and the Pope in a third bull set the\r\nquestion for ever at rest in favour of the university. The solemn\r\nvisitation of the colleges which had taken place under the auspices of\r\nArchbishop Arundel in 1401 was probably the result of the temporary\r\nvictory obtained by the Primate when the chancellor refused to take an\r\noath of obedience to him.\r\n\r\nThe early college statutes were as eager to repel the religious as the\r\nrule of Benedict, the father of western monasticism, was to repel the\r\nclergyman.[56] The statutes of Michaelhouse (1334), the earliest which\r\nhave reached us intact, provide that neither monk nor friar should\r\nobtain admittance to the college. The statutes of Peterhouse enact that\r\nno one deciding to enter a religious order can remain on the foundation.\r\nIt must at the same time be clearly realised that some of the earliest\r\ncolleges were little more than clerical seminaries.[57] What is peculiar\r\nto Cambridge is that there a monk made the earliest attempt to endow\r\nlearning for the secular clergy--a monk who was also a bishop, the\r\never-memorable Hugh Balsham. The non-monastic direction taken was by no\r\nmeans as yet an anti-monastic one; but at the rise of both universities,\r\nas soon as scholars were endowed and endowed houses began to be built\r\nfor them, the monastic and the academic careers were regarded as\r\nincompatible vocations. It was the separation of the _clerk_ from the\r\n_religious_, the recognition by Balsham of the secular scholar and of an\r\nendowed foundation for such scholars which was neither a religious house\r\nnor an _episcopia_, that transformed a more or less fortuitous concourse\r\nof students and teachers--a mere amplification, as at Oxford, of the\r\nschool system of other great centres--into a chartered corporation of\r\nscholars--a university.[58]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n     School and university--Stourbridge fair--the university in the xiii\r\n     century--Foundation of endowed scholars--hostels.\r\n\r\nBoth our universities doubtless count a school life of eight centuries\r\nat least: but a school life, the activity of teachers and scholars, is\r\nnot the same thing as a university life. We have already said that\r\nOxford owed its history to the constant communication between it and\r\nLondon, to its accessibility from the capital which made it the frequent\r\nresort not only of our kings but, what is more to our purpose, of\r\nscholars European and English.[59] The ferment created by their lectures\r\nno doubt kept alive the desire for knowledge and the spirit of enquiry\r\namong the motley population of the town; a moral atmosphere which in\r\nits turn attracted students. At Cambridge everything was the opposite of\r\nthis. S. Frideswide’s at Oxford was a poor religious house, but it was\r\nin the heart of the town; the monastery at Ely was a great religious\r\nhouse, but its school was many miles from the university. Cambridge, as\r\nwe have seen, was accessible to no great centre, there was nothing to\r\nattract the traveller who if he visited it almost certainly went out of\r\nhis way to do so. Nevertheless some influences were at work in the xii\r\ncentury which determined the transformation of Cambridge into a _studium\r\ngenerale_, a university. The river near the town, as I have already\r\nsaid, gave rise to one of the greatest fairs in England, and Mr. J. W.\r\nClark is disposed to see in the concourse of people brought together by\r\nStourbridge fair the determining factor in our university history. The\r\nfair was called after the Stour a stream lower down the river, and was\r\nheld in a large cornfield near Barnwell. It began on the feast of S.\r\nBartholomew, August 24, and lasted till the fourteenth day after the\r\nfeast of the Exaltation of the Cross (September 14). These five weeks of\r\nrevelry proved more disturbing to Cambridge studies than the May term of\r\nto-day; xiii century scholars spent their money at Stourbridge fair as\r\nIsaac Newton spent his in the xviith; there he acquired his prism in\r\nAugust 1661 and a book on “Judicial Astrology” the geometry and\r\ntrigonometry of which were then as ‘Greek’ to him. Sea-borne goods which\r\nhad probably always been brought inland up the river to this point,\r\nformed the nucleus of the fair at Stourbridge. It is generally agreed\r\nthat three other English fairs exceeded the Cambridge fair in\r\nimportance, those at Bristol, Bartholomew’s in London, and Lynton. Defoe\r\nhowever describes it as the largest in Europe, greater than that at\r\nNuremberg or than the Frankfort mart. It\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1211.]\r\n\r\nwas already highly prosperous when King John made over its dues to the\r\nleper hospice of S. Mary Magdalene; and it has been suggested that this\r\nwas the ancient fair to which Irish merchants brought their cloth in the\r\ntime of Athelstan.\r\n\r\nWhy so uncommercial a district became the site of one of the greatest\r\nfairs in Europe, and why a _studium generale_ became established there,\r\nare problems both of which we cannot resolve. There always remains at\r\nthe bottom some virtue in the apparently unpropitious city on the banks\r\nof the Granta which as an Italian would say _fece da sè_. But Mr. J. W.\r\nClark’s suggestion has at least placed the two problems in\r\njuxtaposition: the growing importance of the schools and the growing\r\nimportance of the fair both meet us in the opening lustres of the xiii\r\ncentury; the fair, that is, has its roots in the preceding century when\r\nthe fate of the embryo seat of learning lay in the balance. How should a\r\nfair, how should an extraordinary concourse of people, help to\r\nconsolidate a university? Simply because this was the age of peripatetic\r\nteaching, because it was the custom all through the middle ages for\r\nwandering scholars to find themselves where men gathered together, and\r\nto claim for a theorem of Roscellinus or a doctrine from Araby brought\r\nby the crusaders the ear of a crowd which had just been entertained by\r\nthe Norman jongleur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Earliest references to Cambridge university.]\r\n\r\nOur first glimpse of the Cambridge schools shows us an immigration of\r\nthe scholars of one university to the other. In 1209,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1209 10th of John.]\r\n\r\nin consequence of an unjust retaliation upon the students, Oxford was\r\ndepleted and its scholars found their way to Cambridge.[60] Nine years\r\nlater we have a rescript of Henry III.’s (1218) ordering all those\r\nclerks\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1218 2nd of Henry III.]\r\n\r\nwho had adhered to Louis to depart the realm. In the eleven years which\r\nelapsed between this and 1229 the Franciscans had established themselves\r\nat Cambridge, and in that year as a result of Henry’s invitation to\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1229 13th of Henry III.]\r\n\r\nParis students to settle in England there was a considerable influx or\r\nforeigners to the university, the echo of which may be traced in two\r\ninteresting rescripts of the year 1231. In one of these the king charges\r\nthe mayor\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1231 15th of Henry III.]\r\n\r\nand bailiffs of the town to deal fairly with members of the university\r\nin the matter or lodgings, and enjoins them to establish according to\r\n“university custom” two masters and two liegemen of the town to act as\r\n“taxors.”[61] Dating the rescript from Oxford on the third day of May\r\nthe king writes: “It is already sufficiently known to you that a\r\nmultitude of scholars has gathered to our town of Cambridge, for the\r\nsake of study, both from the regions near home and from beyond the seas;\r\nthe which is most grateful and acceptable to us, because it gives an\r\nexample of no small convenience to our whole realm, and our honour is\r\nthereby increased; and you especially, among whom these students are\r\nloyally dwelling should feel it matter of no little gratulation and\r\nrejoicing.”[62] In the second rescript, dated from Oxford on the same\r\nday, the king enjoins that no clerk shall live in the town (_quod nullus\r\nclericus moretur in villa_) who is not under a _magister scholarum_.[63]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charters and Bulls. Charter of Hen. III. A.D. 1231. Bull of\r\nJohn XXII. A.D. 1317.]\r\n\r\nThese letters patent addressed to the mayor and burgesses of the town by\r\nHenry III. in 1231 are the earliest existing document which can be\r\nregarded in the light of a university charter.[64] At the same time it\r\nappears by no means certain that royal letters had not been addressed\r\nearlier to Cambridge in which the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORIEL WINDOW OF THE HALL, TRINITY GREAT COURT\r\n\r\nIn the nearer part of the picture is the Master’s Lodge, and in the far\r\ndistance two turrets of King’s Chapel stand up against the evening\r\nsky.]\r\n\r\nacademic society there was treated as a moral entity. In the following\r\nreign the jury of Cambridge made oath to the effect that “the Chancellor\r\nand Masters of the university had appropriated to themselves more ample\r\nliberties than were warranted in the charters granted them by the king’s\r\npredecessors”;[65] and in the same way when, at the request of Edward\r\nII., John XXII. erects Cambridge into a _studium generale_ in the second\r\nyear of his pontificate, he reaffirms and confirms the privileges with\r\nwhich his predecessors in the apostolic chair and the English kings had\r\nadorned the university: _omnia privilegia et indulta praedicto studio\r\n... a pontificibus et regibus praedictis concessa_.[66] In this\r\ninstrument he refers to Cambridge university as _studium ab olim ibi\r\nordinatum_, “the university from old time there established.” Cambridge\r\nand Oxford, however, like the earliest centres of learning in Italy and\r\nFrance--Bologna and Paris--_grew into universities_; papal\r\nauthorisations follow instead of preceding their institution. In other\r\ncases universities were definite creations which make their first\r\nappearance with a bull of institution and inauguration attached to\r\nthem.[67]\r\n\r\nHenry III.’s writs in behalf of Cambridge begin in the second and cover\r\nthe fifty years of his reign. In the 45th and again in the 50th year he\r\nrepeats and confirms his previous rescripts. The scholastic prosperity\r\nof Cambridge dates from this reign as its civil prosperity dates from\r\nthat of Henry I.; and the traditions that Cambridge was Beauclerk’s\r\n_alma mater_ and that Henry V. was a student at Oxford probably both\r\nderive from the signal favours shown to the two by these monarchs\r\nrespectively.[68] Cambridge however was greatly reduced in the reign of\r\nJohn, especially about the year 1214 in spite of the recent immigration\r\nfrom Oxford.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Henrys and the Edwards.]\r\n\r\nBut from the accession of Henry III. onwards the university city became\r\nthe special care of the Henrys and the Edwards. Edward I., while still\r\nPrince of Wales, visited the town in 1254 and undertook the\r\npacification of the quarrels in which scholars and townsmen were\r\nengaged.[69] A document sealed with his own seal and those of the\r\nuniversity and the borough ordained that henceforth 13 scholars and 10\r\nburgesses should be chosen to represent the interests of both parties.\r\nFive of the former were to be Englishmen, 3 Scotchmen, 3 Irishmen, and 2\r\nfrom Wales. The proportions are interesting.[70] It was soon after\r\nEdward’s accession that the refusal of Cambridge\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 4th Edw. I. A.D. 1276.]\r\n\r\nstudents to obey summonses to the archidiaconal courts led to Balsham’s\r\njudicious settlement of the point.[71]\r\n\r\nEdward II. continued the interest shown in Cambridge by his father and\r\ngrandfather; not only obtaining for it the status of a _studium\r\ngenerale_ but maintaining a group of scholars there at his own\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1317.]\r\n\r\ncharges--“king’s scholars” who were to rank with Ely and Merton scholars\r\nin historical importance. The favour shown to the university by the\r\nmagnificent king his son was perhaps the one instance in which he took\r\npains to fulfil the intentions of his murdered father.[72]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foundation of endowed scholars. Hugh de Balsham]\r\n\r\nIn the long reign of Henry III., in the year 1257, Hugh de Balsham,[73]\r\nsubprior of Ely, was made tenth bishop of the diocese; and it was then\r\nthat he placed and endowed at S. John’s hospital a group of secular\r\nstudents known as “Ely scholars,” who were the object of his anxious\r\ncare until his death in 1286. His scheme and its results are described\r\nin the next chapter.[74] At this time there were no endowed houses at\r\nCambridge, no school buildings, no endowed scholars.[75] It was some\r\nthirty years after the arrival of the Franciscans, the Carmelites had as\r\nyet taken no part in the academic life, and many years were to elapse\r\nbefore the Dominicans made their appearance. It was fifty years since\r\nthe Oxford immigration, and thirty since the king had invited over the\r\nstudents from Paris. The distinction that was now made between the\r\nclerk-canon, or the clerk-friar, and the scholar in arts or theology who\r\nwould remain a secular, converted, as we have said, the university\r\ncorporation into something more--a _studium generale_, and led, as we\r\nshall see, to the building of the first endowed colleges.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Walter de Merton.]\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with Balsham there lived and toiled another college\r\nlegislator, Walter de Merton, Chancellor of England and afterwards\r\nBishop of Rochester. His prime importance in developing the collegiate\r\nconception will be seen in the next chapter; here we are concerned with\r\nhim as a founder of endowed scholars. Merton had eight nephews to\r\neducate, and he set about designing an academic scheme the far-reaching\r\neffects of which endure to this day, although the steps of the scheme\r\nare involved in an obscurity which responds to his own hesitations. He\r\nfirst assigned his manor of Malden,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1264.]\r\n\r\nadjoining Merton in Surrey, as a chef-lieu and endowment for “poor\r\nscholars in the schools” who are living under a code of rules prescribed\r\nby himself. During the next five years he acquired lands both in\r\nCambridge and Oxford; his chief acquisition at the former being in 1269,\r\nwhen he purchased an estate lying under the shadow of the Conqueror’s\r\ncastle which included the Norman manor house known as the School of\r\nPythagoras. This property had been in the possession of the Dunnings\r\nsince the Conquest, and was afterwards known as the Merton estate. In\r\nthe same year William de Manfield, who held a mortgage on this property,\r\nstates that he had given his lands in Cambridge to the house, scholars,\r\nand brethren of Merton--_domui et scholaribus et fratribus de\r\nMerton_.[76] Meanwhile Walter de Merton had been buying land at\r\nOxford,[77] and in 1274 he definitely moved the hall at Malden and\r\nrefounded it as Merton College in the sister university; the formula\r\nhitherto maintained in his charters and statutes (see ii. p. 68) being\r\nnow changed, and “poor scholars who are studying at Oxford or elsewhere\r\nwhere a _studium generale_ exists” (_Oxoniae, aut alibi, ubi studium\r\nviget generale_) becomes “who are studying at Oxford where there is a\r\nuniversity” (_Oxoniae ubi universitas viget studentium_).\r\n\r\nThe scheme thus crowned in 1274 had had its birth twelve years before\r\nwhen in 1262 Gilbert de Clare Earl of Gloucester allowed the manor of\r\nMalden to be assigned to the Austin priory of Merton or to some other\r\nreligious house for the sustenance of _clerici in scholis degentes_\r\n(poor clerks in the schools) who were living according to Merton’s\r\nprescriptions.[78] This vesting of endowments in a religious house was\r\nalready familiar at both universities. The Bishop of Ely (Kilkenny) had\r\nvested his exhibitions for divinity students in the prior of Barnwell in\r\n1256, and it appears that this was Merton’s first intention. Two years\r\nlater, however, we find him assigning Malden and other manors to his\r\nnephews, the beneficiaries being still described as “poor scholars in\r\nthe schools.”\r\n\r\nAny scholars maintained at either university by these endowments were\r\n“Merton scholars.” This is again made perfectly clear when the charter\r\n(and statutes) of 1270 were issued, in which Walter de Merton settles\r\nthe Cambridge estates as part of the Malden endowments for “scholars\r\nstudying in Oxford or elsewhere.” It was part of his plan to acquire\r\nlocal endowments at both universities, and also that vast clerical\r\npatronage in the different shires which was obviously destined to ensure\r\nthe future of his scholars. This was the scheme eventually concentrated\r\nin the foundation of Merton, Oxford: and when Bishop Hobhouse is\r\ninclined to anticipate the date at which Merton scholars were\r\nestablished there, we may entirely agree with him, only adding that if\r\nthere were certainly Merton scholars at Oxford before 1274, there were\r\nno less certainly Merton scholars at Cambridge also before that date.\r\nMerton’s scholars had their chef-lieu at Malden, but were studying at\r\nthese two universities, and possessed endowments at both during the\r\ndecade 1264-1274.\r\n\r\nThe Hundred Rolls furnish us with ample references to the Cambridge\r\nscholars. In the Rolls for the borough and town of Cambridge, the 2nd\r\nyear of Edward I., they are accused of poaching on the\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1274.]\r\n\r\nfishing rights of the townsmen. “A servant of the House of the Merton\r\nscholars[79] had appropriated to his masters’ use a certain foss common\r\nto the whole town.” In the later inquisitions of the 7th of Edward I.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1278-9.]\r\n\r\nwe find them figuring among the most considerable Cambridge landlords,\r\none entry showing them to us as purchasers of land from Manfield: _Item\r\nscolares de Merton tenent unum mesuagium cum quadraginta et quinque\r\nacris terre ... quas emerunt de Willelmo de Manefeld_.[80]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1278-9.]\r\n\r\nThree of these entries point to tenure of no very recent date. Thus\r\nEustace Dunning sold to Walter Howe a messuage with a croft which\r\nEustace had inherited from his father Hervey Dunning, and for which the\r\nHowes, in accordance with an assignment made by Eustace Dunning, gave\r\ntwelve pence a year to the clerks of Merton (_per assignationem\r\npraedicti Eustachi clericis de Merton xii^{d}_).[81] The declaration is\r\nmade by John son and heir of Walter Howe, so that Eustace Dunning’s\r\nappointment in favour of the\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1278-9.]\r\n\r\nMerton clerks refers to some time back. Again, Agnes daughter of the\r\ntailor Philip inherited a messuage in the parish of S. Peter which her\r\nfather “had held of the Merton scholars.” In the last place the\r\nCambridge jurymen affirm that two annual attendances should have been\r\nmade at the court of Chesterton for a holding of Eustace Dunning’s, but\r\nthat the scholars of Merton had failed to put in an appearance _for the\r\npast six years_.[82]\r\n\r\nThese transactions cannot be held to relate to an estate managed for\r\nthe Oxford college founded in 1274, and to a period covering not more\r\nthan four or five years. From 1274, which is also the date of the\r\nearliest Hundred Rolls, the Merton scholars were definitely and finally\r\nestablished at Oxford; and when John Howe and Agnes Taylor gave their\r\nevidence it is probable that there were no longer Merton scholars in\r\nCambridge: what their depositions seem to indicate is a concurrent\r\nantiquity for Merton scholars at both universities. If these scholars\r\nhad not been settled among them when these land transactions occurred\r\nthe references would certainly have been to scholares de Merton\r\n_Oxoniae_,[83] and it is well worthy of notice that the only two\r\ninstances in the Cambridge Hundred Rolls where “the Merton scholars at\r\nOxford” are referred to are two instances where Walter de Merton is said\r\nto have “alienated” land in Cambridge for the use of the scholars in\r\nOxford.[84]\r\n\r\nNo doubt it had always been part of Merton’s design to found a\r\nresidential college for his scholars at one of the universities; and he\r\nhad perhaps strong reasons for establishing this at Cambridge. His great\r\npatron was Chief-Justice Bassett, and the Bassetts were Cambridge\r\nlandowners. His patron in the original assignment of Malden manor was\r\nGilbert de Clare whose family gave its name in the next century to the\r\neponymous college at the same university. Was the _domus de Merton_ of\r\n“the scholars and brethren” (p. 39) in fact at one time such a\r\nresidence? where poor scholars, some of them perchance from Merton\r\npriory school itself, lived under the auspices of the Merton brethren?\r\nCertain it is that a prior of Merton intrudes himself and his affairs\r\ninto the Cambridge Hundred Rolls.[85] It is also certain that the House\r\nof Scholars of Merton is first heard of not at Oxford but at Cambridge.\r\nMr. J. W. Clark has pointed out in another connexion that the words\r\n_domus_ and _aula_ were employed when a building was “appropriated by\r\nendowment as a fixed residence for a body of scholars.” Our _domus\r\nscholarium de Merton_ on which Cambridge lands were bestowed--to which\r\nCambridge lands were confirmed--in 1269, could not have been either in\r\nSurrey or at Oxford.\r\n\r\nWhether there was a house of Merton scholars at Cambridge before there\r\nwas a house of Merton scholars at Oxford, or not, it would appear that a\r\nlike antiquity must be claimed for the scholars themselves at both\r\nuniversities.[86]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Universities in other towns. The licence to found a\r\nuniversity at Northampton.]\r\n\r\nOne of the odd things about Merton’s movements is that though he began\r\nbuying land in Oxford the year after the Malden foundation (1265), he\r\nmade his chief acquisition in Cambridge as late as 1269, and that a year\r\nlater when he issued a revised set of statutes (1270) he still makes no\r\nallusion to any change of locality. It is possible that in 1265 when he\r\nwrote “at Oxford or at any other university” he had in mind the\r\ntentatives then being made to found an English university in some other\r\ntown. It was in fact in 1262, the 45th year of the reign of Henry III.,\r\nthat Cambridge students had migrated to Northampton with the king’s\r\nlicence to found a university. The traditional bickerings between\r\nsoutherners and northerners three years previously had been the cause of\r\nthe exodus, and the Cambridge scholars found many Oxonians already\r\nthere who had migrated from Oxford after their quarrel with the papal\r\nlegate in 1238 but had obtained no licence to institute a university.\r\nThe licence accorded to the masters and scholars of Cambridge university\r\nwas withdrawn four years later on a representation being made to Henry\r\nIII. that a university at Northampton must prove prejudicial to\r\nOxford.[87] Migrations of students to other towns took place throughout\r\nthe xiii century. They begin in 1209 when there was a general exodus\r\nfrom Oxford not only to Cambridge but to the town of Reading. Thirty\r\nyears later the Oxonians migrated to Northampton and Salisbury, being\r\nfollowed to the former in 1262 as we have just seen by many Cambridge\r\n“masters and scholars.” These migrations certainly indicate that Oxford\r\nand Cambridge were not yet regarded as such permanent homes of English\r\nscholarship that other sites could not be substituted. The event which\r\nmost impressed the popular imagination occurred when both universities\r\nhad attained to European fame--the exodus in the reign of Edward III.\r\nfrom Oxford to Stamford which caused the king in 1333 to issue his royal\r\nletters forbidding any one to teach there. It had been prophesied that\r\nthe studies pursued at Oxford would be transferred to Stamford, and the\r\nCambridge floods gave rise to another prophecy, recorded by Spenser,\r\nwhich showed that the Stamford incident still occupied men’s minds. The\r\nflat Lincolnshire country would, it was said, become completely flooded,\r\nand Stamford then would\r\n\r\n   ---- shine in learning more than ever did\r\n    Cambridge or Oxford England’s goodly beames.\r\n\r\nNo migration took place from Cambridge after the foundation of its first\r\ncollege. But before we enter upon this period of its history, and find\r\nourselves in the brilliant epoch which was so soon to overtake the\r\nuniversity in the xiv century, let us see what arrangements were made\r\nfor the accommodation of the scholar population previous to the\r\nexistence of colleges.\r\n\r\nAt first--in the xii and the early part of the xiii centuries--scholars\r\nlived each at his own charges; perhaps groups of three and four would\r\nclub together, but every scholar was then, as Fuller expressively has\r\nit, “his own founder and his own benefactor.”[88] The rescript of the\r\nearly years of Henry III., already cited,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1231 15th of Henry III.]\r\n\r\nintroduces us to the town hostels--_hospitia locanda_; and establishes\r\nthe taxing of lodging house charges by the _taxatores_, a usage probably\r\nrendered the more necessary owing to the great influx of students two\r\nyears before, when the demand for lodgings must have been very much in\r\nexcess of the supply.[89] These town hostels, the result of town\r\nenterprise, were subject to the four “taxors” only, and were under no\r\nother academic supervision.[90] It seems highly probable, however, that\r\nthe king’s rescript gave rise to the university hostels, some thirty of\r\nwhich were in existence fifty years later. In any case the rescript\r\nleads us to conclude that the town hostels were in existence in the\r\nprevious century, and supplies us with a date before which we cannot\r\nsuppose that any university hostel existed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The university hostel.]\r\n\r\nThe university hostelries or inns for the accommodation of scholars who\r\nlived there at their own charges were intermediate between the town\r\nlodging house and the college, which they both anticipate and\r\nsupplement. A number of scholars joined together, elected their own\r\nprincipal, and paid him at a fixed rate for board and lodging. At first,\r\ntherefore, the university like the town hostel was a private enterprise,\r\nscholars undertook the charge of them in their private capacity. The\r\nhead of the hostel was called the Principal. Later on these institutions\r\nchanged their democratic character. The government passed entirely into\r\nthe hands of the principal, certain oaths were exacted of him, and he\r\nkept a list of the scholars in his house.[91] The principal collected a\r\nrent from the inmates, though in some hostels the accommodation appears\r\nto have been free. All these changes, we may imagine, belong to the time\r\nwhen some of the hostels were affiliated to colleges, becoming\r\nthenceforward subject in all respects to the customs and discipline of\r\nthe endowed foundation. Thus S. Mary’s hostel, where Matthew Parker\r\nstudied, was affiliated to Corpus, Borden’s belonged to S. John’s\r\nhospital, then to Ely, and in 1448 was affiliated to Clare; S. Bernard’s\r\nbelonged first to Queens’ then to Corpus; S. Austin’s to King’s. The\r\nhostels took their name sometimes from the neighbouring church or\r\nchapel, or other saintly patron, and sometimes from their proprietor.\r\n“Newmarket” and “Harleston” hostels must have served for students from\r\nthese neighbouring towns. The monks who first came to study in Cambridge\r\nlived in lodgings; but these were soon exchanged for the monastic\r\nhostel, hence “Ely hostel” and “Monks’ hostel.”[92] Those zealous\r\nlearners the friars of the Sack had Jesu hostel, dismantled in 1307, the\r\nSempringham canons had S. Edmund’s hostel, the Barnwell canons had a\r\nhostel in the town called S. Augustine’s, and the hospitaller knights of\r\nS. John owned Crouched and S. John’s hostels in School Lane and Mill\r\nStreet.[93] Rud’s offers a good example of a xiii century Cambridge\r\nhostel, and Physwick of one of the xivth. The former is mentioned in\r\n1283 and was part of the compensation allowed in that year to S. John’s\r\nfor the alienated hostels at Peterhouse,[94] it still exists, almost\r\nunaltered, and forms part of the Castle inn in S. Andrew’s Street.\r\nPhyswick was the private residence of an esquire bedell of that name who\r\nbequeathed it for the purposes of a hostel in 1393. It was affiliated to\r\nGonville and was in use until absorbed in the buildings of Trinity\r\nCollege in the xvi century.\r\n\r\nCambridge hostels were highly important foundations. The 8 jurists’\r\nhostels housed eighty and a hundred students apiece, and the large\r\nhostels of S. Bernard, S. Thomas, S. Mary, and S. Augustine sometimes\r\nhoused twenty and thirty regents without counting the non-regents and\r\nstudents.[95] A large proportion of men whose names are not to be found\r\non the books of any college received their education in these houses.\r\nThe Inns, of which there were three at Cambridge--Oving’s, S. Zachary’s,\r\nand S. Paul’s--were smaller and less important hostels and appear to\r\nhave been frequented by the richer students. Hostel and hall or college\r\nexisted side by side through the xiii, xiv, and xv centuries. Indeed\r\nuntil the college system was well established the hostels greatly\r\nexceeded the endowed halls in number, and they continued to supplement\r\nthe latter until the completion of the large colleges at the renascence.\r\nSome twenty were erected as late as the xv and the opening years of the\r\nxvi centuries. During the xiv and xv centuries many hostels were\r\ndestroyed to make room for the colleges; and in the xvith those which\r\nremained were abandoned, Trinity\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD CASTLE INN\r\n\r\nNow styled “Ye Olde Castel Hotel.” The Baptist Church and the Police\r\nCourts are seen just beyond, and the Roman Catholic Church in the\r\ndistance.

Each college is independent and autonomous, and though\r\nthe aggregate of colleges does not constitute the university, each\r\ncollegiate foundation forms part and parcel of it in virtue of its union\r\nwith the incorporated society of Chancellor Masters and Scholars which\r\nformed at first and still forms “the university.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The college the distinguishing characteristic of Cambridge\r\nand Oxford].\r\n\r\nIt is the collegiate system which distinguishes the English universities\r\nfrom all others. Everywhere else in Europe students live in their own\r\nprivate lodgings and have complete control of their lives, subject to no\r\nsupervision whatever; the university has no rights over them and no\r\nmeans of ensuring their good behaviour during the period in which they\r\nchoose to attend its lectures. In many parts of Europe the student\r\npasses from a school curriculum in which he has been treated as a\r\ncomplete dependent, on whose sense of common fairplay and honour, even,\r\nno reliance can be placed, to a curriculum in which he at once becomes\r\nhis own absolute master. English instinct is against this--against\r\nabandoning a young man at a critical moment of his life to his own\r\ndevices, his own unsupported endeavours, as it is against ruling him by\r\na system of espionage in his school days. It is in favour in both cases\r\nof the moral support to be found in an external guarantee for order,\r\norderliness--and of a tacit assistance to good instincts, a tacit\r\nresistance to bad; and the result is the university college.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The origin of the college system.]\r\n\r\nThe result, as we say, is an English result, and is the development of a\r\nscheme to which shape was first given by Walter de Merton, Chancellor of\r\nEngland and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, and Hugh de Balsham Bishop\r\nand formerly subprior of Ely, in the reign of Henry III.[98] An endowed\r\nhouse and college statutes formed part of this fine academic scheme,\r\nwhich, in all its amplitude and completeness, sprang Athena-like from\r\nthe brain of Walter de Merton, and was destined from the first to be\r\nrealised in a university. It must, nevertheless, be clearly borne in\r\nmind that the original college dwellings--and the college statutes--were\r\ndesigned for adult scholars, they were, in fact, the earliest training\r\ncolleges for teachers, and it is only later that their advantages were\r\nextended in equal measure to the taught.[99]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The era of college building.]\r\n\r\nCollege building began in the xiii century and ended with the xvith. The\r\nfirst great period of building, however, belongs to the second quarter\r\nof the xiv century, and no less than seven colleges and halls were\r\nfounded between the years 1324 and 1352. Ninety years elapsed before\r\nthe second period, which began with the foundation of King’s College in\r\n1441 and ended with the foundation of S. John’s in 1509. The third and\r\nlast period opened a hundred years after the foundation of King’s and\r\nclosed with the foundation of the first Protestant colleges fifty years\r\nlater (1595):\r\n\r\n  First period.

John’s Hospital.[101] In\r\n1284 he removed the Ely clerks to two hostels by S. Peter’s church at\r\nthe other end of the town, and at his death two years later left three\r\nhundred marks for the erection of a hall. This was built in 1290 on the\r\nsouth-west and formed with the scholars’ chambers the only collegiate\r\nbuilding at Peterhouse till the close of the xiv century. Here then were\r\nthe primitive elements of a college; the hostel or scholars’ lodging\r\nhouse to which was added a common meeting and dining room, or hall. The\r\nlittle parish church of S. Peter served for prayers and gave its name to\r\nthe college. College chapels were not built till considerably later: the\r\nexample first given by Pembroke College in the next century not being\r\nfollowed for another hundred years. The quadrangle was not begun till\r\n1424. A combination room[102] opening out from the hall, and a library,\r\nwere added along the south side. Over the former was the master’s room,\r\nover the latter the students’ quarters; and all looked upon the ancient\r\nlawn, the meadow with its elms beyond and, stretching to the right, with\r\nits water gate, Coe fen.\r\n\r\n    Ye brown, o’er-arching groves,\r\n    That contemplation loves,\r\n    Where willowy Camus lingers with delight!\r\n    Oft at the blush of dawn\r\n    I trod your level lawn\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    With Freedom by my side, and soft-eyed Melancholy.[103]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETERHOUSE FROM THE STREET\r\n\r\nThe Tower of the Congregational Church in the distance.]\r\n\r\nHostels and church, facing the Trumpington road, were just without\r\nTrumpington gate. In 1309 the college area was extended southwards, over\r\nthe ground occupied by Jesu hostel.[104] The property of the Gilbertine\r\ncanons was added in the xvi century. The college area covers the space\r\nbetween Trumpington Street and Coe fen, and Little S. Mary’s church and\r\nScroope Terrace; two-thirds of the site of the Fitzwilliam Museum being\r\nground purchased from Peterhouse. The new Gisborne building (1825) is\r\nbuilt on the west beyond the hall. The frontage of Peterhouse on\r\nTrumpington Street is unpromising; nothing suggests the charm of the\r\nbuildings on the south side or the open country beyond, stored with\r\nhistorical memories. From the hall, a site unrivalled in the university,\r\nopens the panelled combination room,[105] the “Good Women” of Chaucer\r\nlimned in one of its bays, recalling\r\n\r\n    The chambres and parlers of a sorte\r\n    With bay windowes\r\n\r\ndescribed by the poet’s contemporary.\r\n\r\nAbove the xvi century library (of which Balsham’s own books were the\r\nnucleus, enriched by Whittlesey, Bottlesham, Arundel, Warkworth, Gray,\r\nPerne, and Cosin)[106] a charming corner room in the students’ quarters\r\nhas been set apart by the present Master for evening study, a veritable\r\n_solarium_ where the readers are surrounded by the portraits of the\r\ngreat sons of Peterhouse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The chapel A.D. 1628.]\r\n\r\nOld S. Peter’s church was perhaps burnt down in 1338-1340 by a fire\r\nwhich is supposed to have also destroyed the chapel of S. Edmund. On its\r\nsite rose the present church of Little S. Mary.[107] But in the early\r\nxvii century a movement was set afoot at Peterhouse which resulted in\r\nthe erection of a college chapel. It now stands in the midst of the\r\ncollege buildings, and one of the two ancient hostels, “the little\r\nostle,” was demolished to provide a site. Matthew Wren, uncle of Sir\r\nChristopher and then Master of the college, afterwards Bishop of Ely,\r\nwas the builder. The desire of the fellows of Peterhouse for a chapel of\r\ntheir own coincided with the movement in the English Church for an\r\nelaborate ritual. As it stands it is a perfect specimen of a xvii\r\ncentury chapel, with its dark oak stalls, and its east window spared\r\nfrom Commonwealth marauders by the expedient of removing the glass piece\r\nby piece and hiding it till the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETERHOUSE--THE FIRST COURT\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the chapel faces the spectator. On the right is seen the\r\nCombination Room (1460) and the Hall. Through the Cloisters we get a\r\nview into the street. This is the oldest college in Cambridge.]\r\n\r\niconoclastic fever had spent itself. But still we have only the shell of\r\nthe original chapel, the roof of which was adorned with figures of a\r\nhundred and fifty angels the statue of S. Peter presiding from the west.\r\nNine years later all this was pulled down by the Commonwealth men and\r\nthe ritualist movement it embodied came to an end.[108]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hall portraits.]\r\n\r\nPeterhouse hall, in common with the halls of all other colleges,\r\ncontains the portraits of its great men: here, however, they look down\r\nupon us not only from the wall above the high table but from the stained\r\nglass of the windows. Holbroke Master of the college, chancellor of the\r\nuniversity during the Barnwell process, and an early student of science;\r\nCardinal Beaufort scholar of the house who represented Henry V. at the\r\nCouncil of Constance, and was himself, perhaps, _papabile_; Warkworth\r\nwriting his Lancastrian Chronicle--are in their doctor’s scarlet: here\r\nalso are Whitgift, Cosin, and Crashaw, who is depicted as a canon of\r\nLoreto; the poet Gray, the third duke of Grafton chancellor of the\r\nuniversity and Prime Minister, and Henry Cavendish the physicist. The\r\npanel portraits were removed here from the Stone parlour. The painting\r\nof Bishop Law by Romney (?) reminds us that many of the Laws were at\r\nPeterhouse, including the first Lord Ellenborough. Over the high table\r\nis Lord Kelvin the latest famous son of the house. Among these must also\r\nbe noted Thomas Heywood “a prose Shakspeare,” Hutchinson “the regicide”\r\none of the first Puritan gentlemen and one of the best, Peter Baro,\r\nMarkland the classical critic, and Sherlock who measured himself against\r\nBossuet.\r\n\r\nPeterhouse owes nothing to royal endowments but it has not lived outside\r\nthe stir of national movements either political or religious. There were\r\nfervent Lancastrians within its walls in the xv century, fervent\r\npartisans of the Stuarts in the xviith. It was, second to none in\r\nEngland, the anti-Puritan college, numbering among its masters Wren and\r\nCosin, and that Doctor Andrew Perne who was among its most munificent\r\nbenefactors.[109] Perne was a Petrean first and a theologian afterwards,\r\nand, as vice-chancellor, was to be found burning the remains of Martin\r\nBucer and Paul Fagius[110] in order to ingratiate the university with\r\nMary, and signing the Thirty-nine Articles on the accession of\r\nElizabeth. The letters AP AP on the weather cock of his college are said\r\nto mean: Andrew Perne, “a Papist” or “a Protestant,” as you will; and in\r\nCantabrigian language a coat that has been turned is a coat that has\r\nbeen _perned_, and _pernare_ signifies to change your opinions with\r\nfrequency.\r\n\r\nSince the xvii century Peterhouse has been connected with no great\r\nmovements. In the xv century and again in the early xixth it produced\r\neminent physical and mathematical students; and in the xviii century\r\nSir William Browne, President of the College of Physicians, learnt here\r\nhis science. Scotchmen have a predilection for the college; and a\r\nnucleus of history men is being formed under the present Master’s\r\nguidance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Little S. Mary’s.]\r\n\r\nThe patronage of the historical church which was for three or four\r\ncenturies the chapel of Peterhouse remains in the hands of the college.\r\nIt is indeed an integral part of Peterhouse for every Petrean. But its\r\ninterest does not end here; it reaches across the Atlantic and binds the\r\nnew continent to the home-hearth of learning in England. A monument in\r\nthe chapel to Godfrey Washington who died in 1729 bears the arms _argent\r\ntwo bars gules, in chief three estoiles_--the origin of the Stars and\r\nStripes. The Washington crest is an eagle issuant from a\r\ncrown--affirming sovereignty or escaping from a monarchy?[111]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cherry Hinton.]\r\n\r\nThe Rectory of Cherry Hinton two and a half miles south-east of\r\nCambridge, on the way to the village of Balsham, is no less important in\r\nthe history of the Ely scholars. In the xiv century the endowment of the\r\ncollege was not sufficient for their maintenance all the year round: the\r\ncollege nevertheless had made rapid progress since its separate\r\nexistence at Peterhouse began, and Fordham Bishop of Ely (1388-1426)\r\ndecided to confirm to them the greater tithes of Cherry Hinton of which\r\nthe college is to this day rector; but which had indeed been first\r\nassigned them by Bishop Simon Langham as early as 1362.[112]\r\n\r\nA visit to this interesting church completes our picture of the college\r\nwhich “his affection for learning and the state of the poor scholars who\r\nwere much put to it for conveniency of lodging” persuaded Balsham to\r\nendow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peterhouse lodge.]\r\n\r\nThe lodge of Peterhouse is on the opposite side of Trumpington Street,\r\nand is the only example of a lodge outside the college precincts in the\r\nuniversity. The house belonged to Charles Beaumont, nephew of the\r\nmetaphysical poet Joseph Beaumont who was Master of Peterhouse, and was\r\nbequeathed by him for the college lodge in 1727.\r\n\r\nPeterhouse has always been one of the small colleges. Balsham founded it\r\nfor a master, 14 fellows, and a few Bible clerks.[113] In the time of\r\nCharles I. (1634) it maintained 19 fellows, 29 Bible clerks, and 8\r\nscholars, making with the college officers and other students a total of\r\n106. Sixty years earlier, when Caius wrote, there were 96 inmates, and\r\nin the middle of the xviii century, 90. To-day there are 11 fellowships,\r\nand 23 scholarships varying from £20 to £80 a year in value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETERHOUSE FROM THE FELLOWS’ GARDEN\r\n\r\nOn the right is the Combination Room (1460), while farther back in the\r\npicture is the Hall, a continuation of this range of most ancient and\r\npicturesque buildings.]\r\n\r\nThe bishops of Ely have never ceased to be the visitors of the college.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Michaelhouse.]\r\n\r\nNearly forty years elapsed before a second college was projected. On\r\nSeptember 27 1324 Hervey de Stanton, who like other founders in both\r\nuniversities--like Merton, Alcock, Wykeham, and Wolsey--was a notable\r\npluralist,[114] opened Michaelhouse on the present site of Trinity. His\r\npurchases for the site had been made in 1323-4, and as was the case with\r\nthe foundations preceding and succeeding it, Michaelhouse was an\r\nadaptation of edifices already existing. It remained one of the\r\nprincipal collegiate buildings until the xvi century and was\r\nsuccessively enlarged by absorbing both Crouched and Gregory’s as\r\nstudents’ hostels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Domus aula collegium._]\r\n\r\nAs Peterhouse was called “the House-of-Scholars of S. Peter,” so was\r\nMichaelhouse called “the House-of-Scholars of S. Michael.” It will be\r\nseen that _domus_ and _aula_ were the earliest appellations. As\r\n_hospitia_ or _diversoria literarum_ signified the unendowed house, so\r\n_domus_ or _aula scholarium_ signified the endowed house. Such compound\r\ntitles as “house of S. Peter or hall-of-scholars of the Bishop of Ely”\r\nprecede, as they explain, the later title _college_. A college denotes\r\nnot a dwelling but a community: precisely the same distinction is to be\r\ndrawn between _domus_ and _collegium_ as between _monasterium_ and\r\n_conventus_. Every university _domus_ was intended for a college of\r\nscholars, as every religious house was intended for a convent of\r\nreligious; the transition was easy, though not logical, from “college of\r\nthe hall of Valense-Marie” to Valence-Marie College, and to-day the word\r\nis used indiscriminately to mean both the building and the\r\ncommunity.[115]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clare Hall 1326-1338.]\r\n\r\nClare Hall was erected on the site of University Hall, a house for\r\nscholars founded during the chancellorship of Richard de Badew who\r\nobtained the king’s licence for it on February 20 1326, when he was\r\nlodged at Barnwell.[116] In the next reign (1344, 18th of Edward III.)\r\nit is referred to as “the hospice belonging to Cambridge university.”\r\nThis hall, like Peterhouse, originated in two hostels purchased for the\r\nuniversity in the street running parallel to the High Street, from the\r\npresent site of Queen’s to the back gate of Trinity.[117] Twelve years\r\nlater Elizabeth de Burgh[118] sister and co-heiress of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLARE COLLEGE AND BRIDGE FROM THE CAM--AUTUMN EVENING]\r\n\r\nGilbert Earl of Clare founded her college and in 1340 she obtained\r\npossession of University Hall,[119] and decreed in 1359 that it should\r\nthenceforth be known as the “House of Clare.”[120]\r\n\r\nThe scheme of building of Clare Hall was quadrangular; but no college\r\nwas longer in the building. A hall, combination room, and Master’s room\r\nwere on the west, while the chapel at the north-east angle was not built\r\ntill 1535.[121] The scholars had till then kept their prayers in the\r\nparish church of S. Zachary and in the south chancel aisle of S.\r\nEdward’s. The present chapel was not begun till 1764. As we see it now\r\nClare is a homogeneous piece of work of the time of Charles I., and in\r\nits classical beauty is one of the finest in Cambridge. This complete\r\nrebuilding occupied twenty-six years--from 1635 to 1661. There is no\r\nrecord of the architect, though an unsupported tradition points to Inigo\r\nJones.\r\n\r\nWhen one pictures Clare Hall it is to recall “the Backs,” the\r\ncharacteristic feature of Cambridge scenery which rivals the beauty of\r\n“the gardens” in the sister university. The grounds of the succession of\r\ncollegiate buildings fronting the ancient High Street, with sloping\r\nlawns, bowling green, and fellows’ garden, extend along the backs of the\r\ncolleges beyond the narrow river over which each college throws its\r\nbridge, and beyond again runs the well known road and the college\r\nplaygrounds.\r\n\r\nClare is supposed to have been the “Soler hall” of Chaucer’s Tale.[122]\r\nIt has enjoyed the reputation of a fashionable college, and indeed of a\r\n“sporting college.” It no doubt enjoyed the former reputation from the\r\nfirst, as a foundation under the patronage of the great house of Clare,\r\nand furnished some of the overdressed dandies who flocked to Cambridge\r\nin Chaucer’s time, as well as his “pore” Yorkshire “scolers” or others\r\nlike them. Ralph Cudworth was Master of the college; Tillotson\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, the martyr bishop Latimer, and Whiston the\r\nsuccessor of Newton were its fellows; and Nicholas Heath primate of\r\nYork, Sir George Downing, Cole the antiquary, Townshend, Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer, the first Marquis Cornwallis, Brodrick Archbishop of\r\nCashel, and Whitehead the laureate were its _alumni_. It was founded for\r\n20 fellows or scholars, 6 of whom were to be in priests’ orders. In 1634\r\nthere were 15 fellows and 32 scholars, in all 106 inmates. In the time\r\nof Caius there had been 129, and in the middle of the xviii century\r\nthere were about 100. There are\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLARE COLLEGE AND BRIDGE FROM THE AVENUE\r\n\r\nKing’s College Chapel is seen through the trees.]\r\n\r\nnow 18 fellowships and 31 scholarships ranging in value from £20 to £60.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: College statutes.]\r\n\r\nThe statutes of Clare Hall were written by the founder in 1359, a year\r\nbefore her death. The statutes of Peterhouse[123] and of Pembroke do not\r\nexist in their original form--and those of Hervey de Stanton for\r\nMichaelhouse and of Elizabeth de Burgh for Clare must be held to be the\r\ntwo types of Cambridge college statutes. Of these the latter rank as the\r\nmost enlightened original code framed for a Cambridge college. Stanton’s\r\ncontain little more than directions for the conduct of a clerical\r\nseminary, and this type was followed by the framers of the statutes of\r\nCorpus Christi and in their general intention by Gonville in statutes\r\nafterwards modified by Bateman. The statutes of King’s Hall framed for\r\nRichard II. reverted to the Merton type; Henry VI.’s statutes for King’s\r\nfollow, as we shall see, the type already laid down by William of\r\nWykeham, while Lady Margaret Countess of Richmond, and John Fisher\r\nBishop of Rochester framed statutes which contain some original\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nElizabeth de Burgh’s originality consists in her realisation of the\r\nvalue of learning and of general knowledge for all kinds of men and for\r\nits own sake. “In every degree, whether ecclesiastical or temporal,\r\nskill in learning is of no mean advantage; which although sought for by\r\nmany persons in many ways is to be found most fully in the university\r\nwhere a _studium generale_ is known to flourish.”[124] Thence it sends\r\nforth its “disciples,” “who have tasted its sweetness,” skilled and\r\nfitted, to fill their place in the world. She wishes to promote, with\r\nthe advancement of religious worship and the welfare of the state, “the\r\nextension of these sciences”; her object being that “the pearl of\r\nknowledge” “once discovered and acquired by study and learning” “should\r\nnot lie hid,” but be diffused more and more widely, and when so diffused\r\ngive light to them that walk in the darkness of the shadow of\r\nignorance.[125]\r\n\r\nThe statutes of Marie Valence were written twelve years earlier and even\r\nin the form in which they have come down to us have a character of their\r\nown and conform to none of the three types of Merton, Michaelhouse, or\r\nClare.[126]\r\n\r\nMerton’s statutes were issued in 1264, 1270, and 1274, and the 1274\r\nstatutes exist in the university library in a register of the Bishops of\r\nLincoln. Mr. J. Bass Mullinger has printed Hervey de Stanton’s in\r\nAppendix D. to his “History of the University of Cambridge”; they are\r\ncontained in the Michaelhouse book in the muniment room of Trinity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor King’s Hall, founded in 1337, see page 131.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HALL OF CLARE COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThe notable features of this interior are the plaster ceiling and the\r\nlarge oak figures over the fireplace, the latter designed by Sir M.\r\nDigby Wyatt 1870-72.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pembroke College A.D. 1347.]\r\n\r\nPembroke Hall was founded in 1347 by Marie daughter of Guy de Chatillon\r\ncomte de Saint-Paul and of Mary grand-daughter of Henry III. She was of\r\nthe blood of that Walter de Chatillon who in the retreat from Damietta\r\nduring the 7th crusade, held a village alone against successive assaults\r\nof the Saracen; and having drawn forth their missiles from his body\r\nafter each sally, charged afresh to the cry of _Chatillon!\r\nChevaliers!_--and the widow of Aymer de Valence Earl of Pembroke the\r\ninexorable enemy of Robert Bruce in Edward’s wars against the Scottish\r\nking. Pembroke stands opposite Peterhouse and several hostels were\r\ndestroyed to make room for it. It was called by the founder the hall of\r\nValencemarie, and in Latin documents _aula Pembrochiana_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Architectural scheme of a college.]\r\n\r\nWith Pembroke the first college foundation stone was laid in Cambridge.\r\nHere for the first time we have a homogeneous collegiate house and not a\r\nmere adaptation of pre-existing buildings, and may therefore enquire\r\nwhat was the architectural plan of a college. The principle of the\r\nquadrangle, although it underwent considerable architectural\r\ndevelopment, was recognised with the first attempt at college\r\narchitecture.[127] The special collegiate buildings at first occupied\r\none side of the court only. Here, facing the gateway, were to be found\r\nthe hall with its buttery and kitchen, above the hall the Master’s\r\nlodging, with perhaps a garret bedroom above it--the _solarium_. The\r\ncombination room attiguous to the hall makes its appearance in the next\r\ncentury, and at right angles or parallel to this main block stretch the\r\nstudents’ chambers and studies. A muniment room or treasury is over the\r\ngate; the library, occupying a third side,[128] and the chapel, come\r\nlater; and last of all the architectural gateway is added.[129] Meadows\r\nand fields and the Master’s plot of ground are soon developed into the\r\nMaster’s garden, the fellows’ garden, the bowling green, and tennis\r\ncourt. By the xv century the buildings round a courtyard easily assume\r\nthe plan of the new domestic dwelling of that epoch, of which the type\r\nis Haddon Hall Derbyshire and, in Cambridge, Queens’ College: the\r\ncollege _domus_ of the xiv century becomes the quadrangular manor-house\r\nof the xvth and xvith. In such a scheme of public buildings only a few\r\nscholars could be lodged in the main court, and smaller quadrangles for\r\ntheir accommodation were therefore added. University Hostel formed one\r\nside of such a second court in Pembroke; Clare and Queens’ had also\r\nsecond courts, and their example was followed at Christ’s and S. John’s.\r\n\r\nHere then we have a scheme of building which is neither monastic nor\r\nfeudal. It may with propriety be called scholastic but it is also\r\nessentially domestic architecture. The college quadrangle as we see it\r\nevolved in Cambridge is the earliest attempt at devising a dwelling\r\nwhich should resemble neither the cloister nor the castle, should\r\nsuggest neither enclosure nor self-defence--a scholastic dwelling. The\r\ncollege is the outcome of that moment in our history when feudalism had\r\nplayed its part and monasticism was losing its power; it represents what\r\nthe rise of the universities themselves represents and its architectural\r\ninterest is unique. No monastic terms are retained; the hall is not a\r\nrefectory, the one constant monastic and canonical feature, the church,\r\nhas no part at all in the scheme--the scholars were men not separated\r\nfrom their fellows and they used the parish church.\r\n\r\nThe first collegiate dwelling houses, like the English manor-house,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously followed one of the oldest house-plans\r\nknown to civilisation--the scheme of dwelling-rooms round a court was\r\nthat of the Roman house. The _aula seu domus scholarium_ had moreover as\r\nits starting point--like the earliest _domus ecclesiae_--a hall in a\r\nhouse; the hall is the nucleus of the college.[130]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The site of Pembroke.]\r\n\r\nMarie de Saint-Paul, like her predecessor Elizabeth de Burgh, purchased\r\nuniversity property for the site of her college. “University hostel”\r\nwhich stood here formed one side of the narrow quadrangle the building\r\nof which was at once begun, and a messuage of Hervey de Stanton’s formed\r\nthe other. Within five years the complete area had been acquired, and\r\nit is probable that the south side was also partly built before the\r\nfounder’s death in 1377. On the west were the hall and kitchen, on the\r\neast, abutting on the street, was the gate with students’ chambers on\r\neither side of it. With the hostel the founder bought an acre of\r\nmeadowland which she converted into an orchard--“the orchard against\r\nPembroke Hall” it is called in her lifetime. She also obtained\r\npermission from two of the Avignon popes--Innocent VI. and Urban V.--to\r\nerect a chapel and bell tower, and these were built, after the middle of\r\nthe xiv century, at the north west corner of the closed quadrangle. This\r\ninteresting site was used later as a library and is still a reference\r\nlibrary and lecture room. Traces of fresco remain under the panelling,\r\nand the chaplain’s room with its hagioscope for the altar is on the\r\neast. The lower part of the bell tower also still exists.\r\n\r\nIn 1389 the college acquired Cosyn’s Place, and later Bolton’s, and in\r\n1451 a perpetual lease of S. Thomas’s hostel. University hostel retained\r\nits name till the last quarter of the xvi century, and it was only\r\npulled down in 1659 to make room for the Hitcham building which now\r\nforms the south side of the second court. There is nothing left of the\r\nxiv and xv century structures. The present lodge, hall, and library and\r\nthe other new buildings in stone and red brick have all been erected\r\nsince 1870. The chapel occupies part of the site of S. Thomas’s hostel,\r\nand was built by Matthew Wren, Bishop of Ely and Master of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD COURT, PEMBROKE COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThe Dining Hall is seen on the right of the picture.]\r\n\r\nPeterhouse, at his own charges; the architect being his nephew\r\nChristopher Wren. The bishop had already built Peterhouse chapel and\r\nthis new work was undertaken in fulfilment of his intention to make some\r\npious offering if he were ever liberated from the Tower, where the\r\nParliament kept him between the years 1642 and 1658. The fine\r\ncombination room is panelled with the oak from the xvii century hall.\r\nThe portrait of Marie de Saint-Paul presides in the present hall with\r\nthat of Henry VI. flanked by busts of Pitt, Gray, and Stokes.\r\n\r\nTwo spiritual relationships were bequeathed by the founder to the\r\ncollege. One with the Franciscan friars, the other with the Minoresses\r\nof Denney. The former connexion ceased almost as soon as it was devised,\r\nfor the existing edition of the statutes (made after the founder’s\r\ndeath) omits all mention of it.[131]\r\n\r\nNo college but Trinity outshines Pembroke for the fame of its scholars\r\nand none for the antiquity of its fame. Henry VI. in a charter granting\r\nlands speaks of it as “this eminent and most precious college, which is\r\nand ever hath been resplendent among all places in the university.”[132]\r\nThe king so favoured it that it was called his “adopted daughter”; and\r\nwhen Elizabeth rode past it on her way to her lodging at King’s she\r\nsaluted it with one of those happy phrases characteristic of the Tudors:\r\n“_O domus antiqua et religiosa!_” words which sum its significance in\r\nuniversity history.\r\n\r\nPembroke is the _alma mater_ of Edmund Spenser,[133] of Gray,[134] of\r\nthe younger Pitt,[135] of Thixtil, fellow in 1519, whose extraordinary\r\nerudition is praised by Caius, of Wharton the anatomist, Sydenham the\r\nxvii century physician, Gabriel Harvey the “Hobbinoll” of the\r\n_Shepherd’s Calendar_,[136] Sir George Stokes the mathematician, and Sir\r\nHenry Maine.[137] *Grindal and *Whitgift[138] of Canterbury, *Rotherham\r\nand *Booth of York, *Richard Fox Master of the college, Bishop of\r\nWinchester, and founder of Corpus Christi Oxford, the two Langtons\r\nBishops of *S. David’s and Winchester, *Ridley the martyr Bishop of\r\nLondon, *Lancelot Andrewes Bishop of Ely, then of Winchester, with\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COURT AND CLOISTERS IN PEMBROKE COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThis represents the First or Entrance Court of the College. Beyond the\r\nCloisters is the Chapel designed by Sir Christopher Wren and completed\r\nin 1664.]\r\n\r\nFelton and *Wren of Ely, are on its honour roll. The second Master was\r\nRobert Thorpe of Thorpe-next-Norwich, knighted by Edward III. and\r\nafterwards Lord Chancellor.[139] The old college garden, loved by\r\nRidley, is much despoiled, but “Ridley’s walk” remains. Pembroke gave\r\ntwo other martyrs for their religious opinions, Rogers and\r\nBradford.[140] Two fellows of the college[141] in the reign of Edward\r\nIII. died in Rome where they had gone to obtain from Innocent VI.\r\npossession of part of the original endowment of the college; a statute\r\nprescribes that mass shall be said for them each July.\r\n\r\nIn the library are Gower’s _Confessio Amantis_ and the _Golden Legend_,\r\nprinted by Caxton. It is this last book which brought him the promise of\r\n“a buck in summer and a doe in winter” from the Earl of Arundel, for its\r\ngreat length had made him “half desperate to have accomplished it.”\r\nThere, too, is Gray’s MS. of the “Elegy.” The college also possesses\r\nBishop Andrewes’ library. Matthew Wren is buried in the chapel, and his\r\nstaff and mitre are preserved in the college, the latter being a\r\nsolitary specimen of a post-reformation mitre; it was worn over a\r\ncrimson silk cap.\r\n\r\nThe college was founded for 30 scholars, if the revenues permitted.[142]\r\nIn the time of Caius it housed 87 members; in Fuller’s time 100\r\n(including 20 fellows and 33 scholars); in the middle of the xviii\r\ncentury the number of students averaged 50 or 60. There are now 13\r\nfellowships and 34 scholarships of the value of £20 to £80.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Founders of Cambridge colleges.]\r\n\r\nThe Cambridge colleges are remarkable for the large proportion of them\r\nfounded and endowed by women. Of the 16 colleges built between the xiii\r\nand xvi centuries, now in existence, 6 are due to the munificence of\r\nwomen--Clare, Pembroke, Queens’, Christ’s, S. John’s, and Sidney Sussex.\r\nNext as college builders come the chancellors of England, the bishops,\r\nand the kings who have each endowed the university with three colleges.\r\nHervey de Stanton, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the reign of Edward\r\nII., Thomas Lord Audley chancellor to Henry VIII., and Sir Walter\r\nMildmay Chancellor of the Exchequer to Elizabeth, all founded colleges,\r\ntwo of which still remain--Magdalene and Emmanuel.[143] Hugh Balsham of\r\nEly, Bateman of Norwich, and Alcock of Ely founded three existing\r\ncolleges--Peterhouse, Trinity Hall, and Jesus.[143a] The kings of\r\nEngland account for some of the finest work in the university, King’s\r\nHall, King’s College, and Trinity College.[144]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The early series of colleges.]\r\n\r\nIn the series of Cambridge colleges the 3 foundations of the early xiv\r\ncentury which followed Peterhouse were all merged in other colleges.\r\nPembroke which was the sixth foundation was the first piece of\r\ncollegiate building to be carried through in Cambridge, and Corpus\r\nChristi must rank as the second.\r\n\r\nThe colleges from Peterhouse to Pembroke:--\r\n\r\n  Peterhouse 1284\r\n  Michaelhouse 1324          (Gonville 1348    )\r\n  {University Hall 1326      (Trinity Hall 1350)\r\n  {Clare 1338\r\n  King’s Hall 1337            Corpus 1352\r\n  Pembroke Hall 1347\r\n\r\nMichaelhouse and King’s Hall went to swell the greatness of Trinity;\r\nUniversity Hall became the foundation stone of Clare: and all of them,\r\nwith Gonville and Trinity Hall, were incomplete adaptations of earlier\r\nbuildings at the time when Pembroke and Corpus were finished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now come to two colleges which formed an East Anglian corner in the\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gonville Hall 1348.]\r\n\r\nWithin a month of the licence granted to Marie de Saint-Paul, Edmund\r\nGonville obtained his for the erection of the hall which is called after\r\nhim. Gonville was an East Anglian parson, rector of two Norfolk parishes\r\nand sometime vicar-general of the diocese of Ely. In one of these\r\nparishes his elder brother Sir Nicholas Gonville of Rushworth had\r\nalready established a college of canons, and Edmund Gonville himself\r\nwas a great favourer of the Dominicans. Edward III.’s licence enabled\r\nhim to found a hall for 20 scholars in Lurteburgh (now Free school)\r\nLane, between S. Benet’s and great S. Mary’s, in 1348. In 1352 this site\r\nwas exchanged with Benet College for another on the other side of the\r\nHigh Street,[145] the present site of Gonville and Caius. The Hall was\r\ndedicated in honour of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and\r\nenjoyed a great reputation among East Anglians and various proofs of\r\npapal favour up to the eve of the Reformation.[146] Like Corpus its\r\nobject was the education of the clergy and theology was to be their\r\nstudy. Alexander VI. (1492-1503) licensed annually two of its students\r\nto preach in any part of England, apparently a unique permission.[147]\r\nHumphrey de la Pole--who resided for many years--and his brother Edward,\r\nsons of the second Duke of Suffolk, were students here; so was Sir\r\nThomas Gresham. Gonville was refounded as Gonville and Caius by Doctor\r\nKeys (Caius) two hundred years later.[148]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trinity Hall A.D. 1350.]\r\n\r\nEdmund Gonville left William Bateman Bishop of Norwich his executor in\r\nthe interests of his new foundation. Bateman, a notable\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRINITY HALL\r\n\r\nThe nearer building seen in the picture is the old Library, and beyond\r\nit are the Latham Buildings.]\r\n\r\nfigure in the xiv century, set forth as Edward’s ambassador to the King\r\nof France in the month that the Black Death made its appearance in East\r\nAnglia (March 1350), and died at Avignon on an embassy from the king to\r\nthe Pope. In 1350 on his return from France,[149] he founded Trinity\r\nHall, near Gonville, on the site of the hostel of the monks of Ely[150]\r\nwhich he obtained for that purpose.[151]\r\n\r\nIf Gonville’s foundation was intended for the country parson, Bateman’s\r\nwas intended for the _prete di carriera_. Both were designed to repair\r\nthe ravages in the ranks of the clergy left by the plague, but while\r\nGonville’s clerks were to devote their time to the study of theology\r\nBateman’s were to study exclusively civil and canon law. The college was\r\nbuilt round a quadrangle,[152] and the religious services were kept in\r\nthe church of S. John the Baptist (or Zachary) and afterwards in the\r\nnorth aisle of S. Edward’s church; these two churches being shared with\r\nthe students of Clare. Indeed it was owing to Gardiner’s policy and\r\nRidley’s advice that Trinity Hall escaped incorporation with Clare\r\nCollege in the reign of Edward VI. The library remains as it was in the\r\nearly years of Elizabeth’s reign, and was founded by Bateman with the\r\ngift of his own collection. The Norfolk men were famous litigants.\r\nDoctor Jessopp has shown that neither the Black Death nor any lesser\r\ntragedy could hold them from an appeal to the law on every trivial\r\npretext. That the first college of jurists should have been founded by a\r\nnative of Norwich is certainly therefore a fitting circumstance.\r\n\r\nStephen Gardiner Bishop of Winchester and Chancellor of England was\r\nMaster of Trinity Hall in the reign of Edward VI. and again in the first\r\nyear of Mary. He used to say “if all his palaces were blown down by\r\niniquity, he would creep honestly into that shell”--the mastership of\r\nTrinity Hall. Other distinguished Masters were Haddon,[153] Master of\r\nthe Requests to Elizabeth, and Sir Henry Maine who had been fellow and\r\ntutor. Bishop Sampson, a pupil of Erasmus, Thirlby, Glisson,[154]\r\nBilney, one of the early reformers, Lord Chesterfield, Bulwer Lytton,\r\nand Leslie Stephen were all members of Trinity Hall, which is still the\r\ncollege of the larger number of Cambridge law students. There are 13\r\nfellowships, and about 12 scholarships varying in value from £80 to £21\r\na year, besides exhibitions of the same value.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the xiv century there were two important guilds in\r\nCambridge, the one under the invocation of _Corpus Christi_ “keeping\r\ntheir prayers in S. Benet’s church,” the other dedicated to the\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     ST. BOTOLPH’S CHURCH AND CORPUS COLLEGE FROM THE STEPS OF THE PITT\r\n     PRESS, TRUMPINGTON STREET\r\n\r\nKing’s College is seen in the distance.]\r\n\r\nBlessed Virgin “observing their offices in S. Mary’s church.” These\r\nguilds or confraternities--which existed all through the middle ages as\r\nthey had existed in classical Rome with precisely similar features--were\r\nto be found, as we know, especially among the artisan class, and took\r\nthe place of our modern trades unions and mutual insurance societies.\r\nLike every enterprise of the ages of faith they had a semi-religious\r\ncharacter, were usually attached as its “sisters and brethren” to some\r\nchurch, and owed their members not only material assistance but\r\nspiritual, paying for masses to be offered for the repose of the souls\r\nof all deceased brethren.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corpus Christi A.D. 1352.]\r\n\r\nIt was two such guilds which forgetting their differences and laying\r\naside all emulations, joined together in the middle of the xiv century\r\nin order to found and endow a college in their town. The brethren of the\r\nguilds had been planning this enterprise since 1342, and in the\r\nfollowing years those who possessed contiguous tenements in the parishes\r\nof S. Benet and S. Botolph pulled them down “and with one accord set\r\nabout the task of establishing a college there.”[155] “By this means\r\n_they cleared a site for their college square in form_.”[156] Here then,\r\nas in the case of King’s Hall and Pembroke, the earliest collegiate\r\nbuildings designed as such, the plan was quadrangular. Sometimes, as in\r\nthe case of Trinity Hall, the adjacent buildings for completing the\r\ncourt could not be at once obtained, in others, as at Corpus itself and\r\nClare, the courts are irregular, owing to the same difficulty of getting\r\nthe foursquare space. Corpus Christi college presents us, indeed, with\r\nthe unique and perfect example in Cambridge of the ancient college\r\ncourt. By March 1352 a clear space, 220 feet long by 140 wide, had been\r\ncleared, and the guilds worked with so much good will that they had\r\nnearly finished the exterior wall of their college in the same year.\r\n“The building of the college as it appears at the present day,” writes\r\nJohn Jocelyn, “with walls of enclosure, chambers arranged about a\r\nquadrangle, hall, kitchen, and Master’s habitation, was fully finished\r\nin the days of Thomas Eltisley, the first Master [1352-1376] and of his\r\nsuccessor” [1376-1377]. This original court is what we see also to-day:\r\nthe buildings are in two floors, the garrets were added later. The hall\r\nrange contains the Master’s lodging with a _solarium_ above it, a door\r\nand passage leading thence to the hall. The three other sides were\r\ndevoted to scholars’ chambers. S. Benet’s served as the scholars’\r\nchurch, and the gate was on this side of the court.\r\n\r\nBefore the reign of Henry VIII. there was but little glass or panelling\r\nin either story of the building. But in Jocelyn’s time the Master’s and\r\nfellows’ rooms were “skilfully decorated” with both. The fellows and\r\nscholars together panelled, paved, decorated, plastered, and glazed the\r\npublic rooms of the college, in one case\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD COURT, CORPUS CHRISTI COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThis is the oldest court in Cambridge. The Tower of the old Saxon Church\r\nof St. Benedict is seen in the background.]\r\n\r\n“the college paying for the material and the scholars for the labour.”\r\nThus was this college born of the democratic spirit and the sentiment of\r\nunion nurtured in the same spirit. The college was called “of Corpus\r\nChristi and the Blessed Virgin” but was familiarly known from the close\r\nof the xiv century to modern times as Benet College. It lay in the heart\r\nof the Saxon town, between the Saxon church of S. Benet and the church\r\nof the Saxon Botolph which also served the scholars for their prayers.\r\nThe former was used until the year 1500, when a small chapel\r\ncommunicating with the south chancel of the church was built. In 1579\r\nSir Nicholas Bacon gave the college a chapel; and the modern chapel is\r\non its site. Sir Francis Drake was the largest contributor next to\r\nBacon. The queen gave timber, and the scholars of the college again\r\ntoiled side by side with the workmen.\r\n\r\nOn March 21, 1353 the guilds made over to their college Gonville’s house\r\nin Lurteburgh Lane which they had exchanged with his executor Bateman.\r\nMore ground was purchased facing the street and in time two large\r\nneighbouring hostels S. Mary’s and S. Bernard’s were acquired for\r\nstudents. The second court has all been built since 1823, and contains\r\nthe modern hall, lodge, library and chapel, and muniment room, and the\r\nLewes collection. The ancient hall serves as the present kitchen.\r\n\r\nIn the Library is one of the most valuable collections of MSS. in the\r\ncountry, the spoils of the dissolved monasteries gathered together by\r\nArchbishop Parker. Here is the oldest or “Winchester” Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle (to A.D. 892), and Jerome’s version of the four gospels sent\r\nby Gregory to Augustin--“the most interesting MS. in England.” Here is\r\nthe splendid Peterborough psalter and “bestiary”; a _penitentiale_ of\r\nArchbishop Egbert’s (A-S. translation); a Pontifical, probably written\r\nbefore 1407; a xv century MS. Homer rescued by Parker from the whilom\r\nbaker of S. Augustine’s Abbey; Matthew Paris’ own copy of his history;\r\nthe Sarum missal of 1506, and a copy of the great English bible of 1568.\r\nHere also is the first draft (1562) of the Articles of Religion, 42 in\r\nnumber, scored over by Matthew Parker’s red chalk; the 3 articles which\r\nwere finally omitted (dealing with the state of the departed, the last\r\ncontaining the statement “That all shall not be saved”) are here struck\r\nout by Parker. The clause concerning the transubstantiation of the\r\neucharist he has similarly overscored.\r\n\r\nCorpus also houses some of the most interesting plate in the university.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Candle rents.\r\n\r\nCorpus Christi procession.\r\n\r\nCollege arms.]\r\n\r\nThe college was the chief sufferer in the peasant revolt of 1381\r\nprincipally on account of the wealth which accrued to it from “candle\r\nrents,” a tax chargeable on the tenants of all houses which had been\r\nguild property.[157] On the festival of Corpus Christi--the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. BENEDICT’S CHURCH FROM FREE SCHOOL LANE\r\n\r\nIts Saxon tower is the oldest building left in Cambridge, and close by\r\nis the oldest piece of College building, the wall of Corpus Christi.]\r\n\r\nThursday in the Octave of Trinity--a great procession which included the\r\nofficers of the united guild, the civic dignitaries, and the university\r\nauthorities, perambulated the town from Benet Church to the bridge, the\r\nMaster bearing the pyx under a rich canopy. Even after the dissolution\r\nof the guild the Master of Corpus continued the procession until it was\r\nabolished by Henry VIII. in the 27th year of his reign (1535/6). The\r\nancient arms of the college consisted of the shields of the two\r\nguilds--the emblems of the Passion for Corpus Christi; the triangle\r\nsymbol of the Trinity for the guild of the Blessed Virgin, above, Christ\r\ncrowning the Madonna and below, the guilds dedicating their college.\r\nException was taken to them in Parker’s time as too papistical, and he\r\ngot the heralds to change them. The new arms still however recorded the\r\ntwo guilds: quarterly, gules and azure, in the first and fourth a\r\npelican, with her young, vulning herself; in the second and third three\r\nlilies proper\r\n\r\n    _Signat avis Christum, qui sanguine pascit alumnos;_\r\n    _Lilia, virgo parens, intemerata refert._\r\n\r\nAmong its great names Corpus counts Sir Nicholas Bacon the father of\r\nFrancis Lord Bacon, Matthew Parker who was Master of the college and its\r\ngreat benefactor in later times, Christopher Marlowe and Fletcher,\r\nArchbishop Tenison, Sir William Paston and a group of xvii century\r\nantiquaries, and Boyle ‘the great earl’ of Cork. Roger Manners was a\r\nconsiderable benefactor. In the time of Henry VII. Elizabeth Duchess of\r\nNorfolk founded a bible clerkship and a fellowship, and placed the\r\nbuttresses of the college.[158]\r\n\r\nThe college soon maintained 8 fellows, 6 scholars, and 3 bible clerks.\r\nAll the inmates were destined by the founders for priests’ orders, this\r\nbeing one of the four foundations in Cambridge due in whole or in part\r\nto the dearth of clerks consequent on the black death.[159] In the time\r\nof Caius Corpus held 93 persons and in Fuller’s time 126. In the xviii\r\ncentury about 60. There are to-day 12 fellowships, about 15 scholarships\r\nvarying from £80 to £30 in value, 3 sizarships worth £25 each, and 6\r\nexhibitions for students from S. Paul’s school, Canterbury, and the\r\nNorwich Grammar school varying from £18 to double this sum.[160]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe building of Corpus Christi marks an historical and closes an\r\narchitectural epoch at Cambridge. The university had indeed two golden\r\nages--the reign of Edward III. and the reign of the Tudors. It has not\r\nbeen sufficiently realised that Cambridge had no European rival in\r\nscholastic activity in either period. In Edward’s reign six colleges\r\nwere built there--King’s Hall, Clare, Pembroke, Gonville, Trinity Hall,\r\nand Corpus; only one college--Queens’--was founded at Oxford during the\r\nsame time. Three of these six foundations signalise local enterprise,\r\nbut the three earlier are a record of the affection of Edward’s house\r\nfor the university; and it is their preference for Cambridge in the xiv\r\ncentury and the preference of the Tudors for it in the xvth and xvith\r\nwhich marks its two great epochs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cambridge in 1353.]\r\n\r\nLet us look at the university as it was in the middle of the xiv\r\ncentury, and let it be the year 1353. It is 250 years since Henry I.\r\nbegan to reign; 150 before Erasmus lived here, and 550 before our own\r\ntime. It is the eve of that great change in the mental and moral _venue_\r\nof humanity which ushered in the modern world. The Oxford friar Occam,\r\nand with him scholasticism, had died four years before, Petrarch was\r\nmourning Laura, and Chaucer was walking the streets of Cambridge the man\r\nwho was to be our link with the early Italian renascence and to clasp\r\nhands across the century with Erasmus. Lastly, it was at this moment in\r\nour history that the final adjustment of Norman and Saxon elements went\r\nhand in hand with the creation of an English language--a period of which\r\nChaucer is our national representative. The town and university were\r\njust emerging from the havoc wrought by the “black death,” but the royal\r\nand noble foundations which had sprung up on all sides before the\r\nappearance of the scourge had already attracted the youth round Edward’s\r\ncourt to Cambridge; necessitating in 1342 Archbishop Stratford’s\r\ninjunction against the curls and rings of the young coxcombs studying\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nCambridge had in fact the reputation of the fashionable university,\r\nwhile its fame is extolled by Lydgate--a younger contemporary of Chaucer\r\nwho had himself studied at Oxford--in words which show that at this date\r\nit was believed also to be the older university.[161] Let us suppose\r\nthat Chaucer is returning from his first walk to Grantchester, along the\r\nTrumpington road, past the scene he describes in the _Reeve’s Tale_, and\r\nlet us follow him up the Saxon High street. He skirts Coe fen and\r\nreaches Peterhouse, its greater and its “little ostle” on the street,\r\nwith Balsham’s hall behind; and as he proceeds he sees on either hand\r\nconspicuous signs of the love of the Edwards for Cambridge--to the right\r\nthe narrow quadrangle of Pembroke, beyond it, off the high road, past S.\r\nBotolph’s and two hostels, lay the limestone walls of Corpus which had\r\njust passed under the protection of Henry of Lancaster;[162] its old\r\ncourt, then the newest of new courts at Cambridge, nestling against the\r\nSaxon church of S. Benet. Behind lay the Austinfriars, and across the\r\nroad the Whitefriars from which Austin’s Lane led to Austin’s hostel,\r\noccupying with Mill street the site of the future King’s College and\r\nKing’s College chapel. To the north of S. Benet’s he sees the university\r\nchurch of Great S. Mary’s, just rebuilt after the fire, and opposite are\r\nthe schools begun a few years previously, with University, Clare, and\r\nTrinity Halls behind, and “le Stone house” of Gonville. Then still to\r\nhis left, where now we see the buildings of Trinity, he beholds the\r\n“gret colledge” King’s Hall which Edward III. has just built,\r\nMichaelhouse with Crouched hostel which passed into its possession in\r\nthe February of this year, and its satellite hostels Ovyng’s and\r\nGarret’s.\r\n\r\nJust beyond King’s Hall is the building which forms the nucleus of the\r\nuniversity in the Norman town--the hospital of S. John, bordering on\r\nBridge street. As soon as this road is reached, which leads to the Great\r\nBridge, we see the crusaders’ round church of S. Sepulchre, and\r\nfollowing the road to the right we come to the Greyfriars, to the site\r\nof the future God’s House, and past Preachers’ street to the Friars\r\nPreachers or Blackfriars. On our left, across in the Greencroft, we have\r\nleft the Benedictine nunnery of S. Rhadegund. Returning past S.\r\nSepulchre’s we cross the river and come to the heart of the Norman\r\ntown--the Conqueror’s castle with the Norman manor house bought by\r\nMerton in its shadow, and the churches of S. Giles and S. Peter.\r\n\r\nMany of the hostels had recently disappeared to make room for the\r\ncolleges, but they were still as regards these latter nearly in the\r\nproportion of three to one--and these latter, with the sole exception of\r\nPeterhouse, had all arisen in the previous thirty years.\r\n\r\nThe sights and sounds in the streets suggested a new epoch--something\r\nalready achieved and something about to be achieved. Something of stir\r\nbefore an awakening. The English language which was to prove in the\r\nhands of its masters one of the finest vehicles of literary expression\r\nbegan everywhere to be heard in place of the French of Norfolk and\r\nStratford-atte-Bowe. The softer southern speech prevailed over\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING’S COLLEGE GATEWAY AND CHAPEL--TWILIGHT EFFECT\r\n\r\nThe Gateway and Screen on the left hand, and beyond it the Chapel. In\r\nthe distance the Senate House, Caius College, and the Tower of St.\r\nJohn’s College Chapel.]\r\n\r\nthe northern, but the dialects of East Anglia and the Ridings of Yorks\r\nwere perhaps most frequently heard. The canons of S. John and S. Giles,\r\nfrom the Norman side of the town, might be met in their black cloaks,\r\nthe Gilbertine canons, from the Saxon side, all in white with the homely\r\nsheepskin cape. The Carmelites had already exchanged their striped brown\r\nand white cloak--representing Elijah’s mantle singed with fire as it\r\nfell from the fiery chariot--for the white cloak to which they owe their\r\nname of Whitefriars. The Romites of S. Austin wore a hermit’s\r\ndress.[163] Benedictine monks from Ely and Norwich could certainly be\r\nseen in the streets of Cambridge,[164] and the Benedictine nuns of S.\r\nRhadegund rode and walked abroad in the black habit as it was the\r\nuniversal custom in that great order for nuns to do. The Dominicans\r\nlooked like canons in their black _cappa_, the Franciscans like peasants\r\nin their coarse grey tunic roughly tied with cord.\r\n\r\nBesides the Carmelites and Austinfriars there were the Bethlemite friars\r\nin Trumpington street and Our-Lady friars by the Castle; the former\r\ncould be distinguished at a distance by the red star of five rays on\r\ntheir cloaks with a sky blue circle in its centre--the star of\r\nBethlehem; but both these communities wore the habit--black over\r\nwhite--of the Dominicans. Scholars poor and rich jostled each other in\r\nthe schools and in the public ways, wearing the long and short gowns of\r\nthe day, the _cote_ which had just come into fashion, or the habit of\r\ntheir order. There were doctors in the three faculties wearing scarlet\r\ngowns and the doctor’s bonnet or _camaurum_, and there was a sprinkling\r\nof doctors and of students from Orléans, Padua, Pavia, and Paris.\r\n\r\nA large number of the inmates of the colleges round, and of the scholars\r\nwalking the streets, wear the clerical tonsure, many scores have the\r\ncoronal tonsure of the friar--yet the feeling in the air is secular.\r\nCambridge has always suggested a certain detachment; neither\r\nzeal--perfervid or sour--nor the pressure of tradition upon living\r\nthought has had its proper home there. It has not represented monastic\r\nseclusion nor hieratic exclusion, and it did so at this moment of its\r\nhistory less than ever. The dawn of the coming renascence shone upon the\r\nwalls at which we have been looking. The modern world has been born of\r\nthe birth-pangs which have since convulsed Europe, and the walls which\r\nwere then big with the future are now big with the past. But it is the\r\ngreatness of Cambridge that amidst the multiple suggestiveness of its\r\nancient halls of learning, tyranny of the past has no place. About it\r\nthe dawn of the renascence still lingers; and the early morning light\r\nwhich presided at its birth still defines the shadows and seems to\r\ntemper the noon-day heat, as light and shade alternate in its history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chaucer at Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nWe have taken it for granted that Chaucer was walking the streets of\r\nCambridge with us. We have no direct evidence as to where Chaucer\r\nstudied; but our indirect evidence is sufficient. In the “Canterbury\r\nTales” Chaucer introduces us to two Cambridge scholars and to a clerk of\r\nOxenforde; and if one considers what would nowadays be called the\r\ninternal evidence of the _Reeve’s Tale_ it is difficult to resist the\r\nconclusion that Chaucer was at Cambridge. How else should he know\r\nTrumpington so well? Its brook, its bridge, its mill, its fen? He knows\r\nabout the “gret colledge” which had risen a few years previously; he\r\nknows that its Master is called “the warden,” that its scholars are also\r\nits “fellaws.” He has learnt there the dialect of Yorkshiremen, and\r\nreproduces not only their turns of speech but characteristic terms--as\r\n_bete_, _kime_, _jossa_--in the East Anglian dialect. If we turn to the\r\n_Miller’s Tale_ all this local colouring is to seek. A “clerke of\r\nOxenforde,” indeed, was no unfamiliar figure in the xiv century,\r\nespecially to a Londoner. Familiarity with the aspect of Cambridge and\r\nits neighbourhood was a very different matter.\r\n\r\nChaucer was probably himself of East Anglian origin. His grandfather\r\nRobert and John his father were both of Ipswich and London, and when he\r\nwas kidnapped by his mother’s family “Thomas Stace of Ipswich” is the\r\nkidnapper. There are two events of his young life known to us, and both\r\nsuggest that he was at Cambridge. One of these we hear about from his\r\nevidence in the famous Scrope and Grosvenor suit in 1386. An upstart\r\nknight--Sir Robert Grosvenor--whose name Chaucer had never heard before,\r\nhad displayed the arms of the Scropes, and Chaucer testifies in the\r\nCourt of Chivalry action which ensues that he had often seen Henry le\r\nScrope use the proud armorials “azure, a bend or” in the French wars\r\nwhere they had been companions in arms twenty-seven years before (1359).\r\nNow this great Yorkshire family were connected with Cambridge from\r\nChaucer’s time: Richard le Scrope, the son of his old comrade, was\r\nchancellor of the university in 1378.[165] Two members of the same\r\nfamily were chancellors in the next century, and the intermarriage of\r\nthe Scropes with the Gonvilles is recorded there to this day in Scrope\r\nor “Scroope Terrace.”[166] Is it not probable that Geoffrey Chaucer knew\r\nHenry Scrope at Cambridge and formed there the friendship which moved\r\nhim to testify in his behalf thirty years later?\r\n\r\nThis conjecture does not become less probable when we turn to the other\r\nincident in his early life, which came to light in 1866 with a fragment\r\nof the household accounts of the wife of Lionel Duke of Clarence. Here\r\nthe name of Geoffrey Chaucer is mentioned (in 1357) as that of a junior\r\nmember of her household. His early connexion with the house of Edward is\r\ntherefore an historical fact like his later friendship with John of\r\nGaunt. Now in 1352 Lionel Plantagenet had married Elizabeth de Burgh the\r\ngrand-daughter and namesake of the founder of Clare Hall Cambridge. The\r\n“gret colledge” about which Chaucer tells us in the _Reeves Tale_ is\r\ncalled “Soler Hall” and “Soler Hall,” so Caius records, was the ancient\r\nname for Clare. Remembering, however, the incomplete condition of Clare\r\nand of other foundations at this date the present writer supposes the\r\n“gret colledge” to have been King’s Hall, the first imposing\r\narchitectural undertaking in the university and the building which must\r\n_par excellence_ have attracted attention in the middle of the xiv\r\ncentury.[167] It may also have been Chaucer’s own college, and in this\r\nconnexion it is worthy of notice that with the exception of the\r\nhalf-dozen “minor scholars” at Pembroke, King’s Hall was at this time\r\nthe only college which educated lads in their teens.\r\n\r\nAssuming the year of the poet’s birth to have been 1340 he would have\r\nbeen going to the university, according to the custom of those days,\r\nabout the year 1353, and his place in Elizabeth de Burgh’s household was\r\nprobably already assured him when he went to Cambridge.[168] He was back\r\nin her service in his seventeenth year and therefore could not have had\r\ntime to study at both universities: and we may add to this that although\r\nhis general knowledge, which he had no time to acquire in later life,\r\nsuggests that he received a university education, there is not a tittle\r\nof evidence to support the idea that Chaucer went to Oxford.\r\n\r\nOne more conjecture: had he got his information about prioress’s French\r\nfrom the religious of the convent of S. Leonard of Stratford-atte-Bowe\r\nwhom we find owning land in Cambridge from the days of Edward I.?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Schools.\r\n\r\nThe High Street and School Street.]\r\n\r\nIt is to this period of the history of Cambridge that the first\r\nuniversity buildings as distinguished from collegiate buildings belong.\r\nDuring the chancellorship of Robert Thorpe, Knight, Master of Pembroke\r\n(1347-64) and Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, afterwards\r\nChancellor of England, the “schools quadrangle” was projected in that\r\nstreet of colleges, unrivalled in Europe, which prolonging the\r\nTrumpington Road as King’s Parade or Trinity Street or S. John’s Street\r\nwas anciently known as the “School street” of the university. It was\r\nalso the high street of the Saxon town of which S. Benet’s tower was the\r\nnucleus, but whether the original Saxon town lay on this side of the\r\nriver, or whether, as frequently happened in the xi century, the Saxon\r\npopulation retreated here leaving the Castle district to their Norman\r\nconquerors, we have no means of determining.[169]\r\n\r\nThere were, then, no public buildings up to the xiv century. The\r\nGreyfriars or the Austinfriars gave hospitality to the university on\r\npublic occasions, and the only brick and mortar evidence of a university\r\nlay in the hostels and colleges. The “Schools” now erected were halls\r\nfor lecturing and scholastic disputations; the north, west, and east\r\nsides were completed by the middle of the next century, the south side\r\nbeing added in accordance with a decision taken in 1457 to build “a\r\n_new_ school of philosophy and civil law, or a library.”[170] This was\r\nerected on university ground (on the south) next to the school of canon\r\nlaw (west). Over this last was the original library room (the “west\r\nroom” 1457) and “a chapel of exceeding great beauty.” The quadrangle\r\ncontained the Divinity school (north) with the Regent and non-regent\r\nhouses; opposite was the Sophisters’ school with the _libraria communis_\r\nor _magna_; on the entrance side were the Chancellor’s (Rotherham’s)\r\nLibrary, Consistory court and Court of the Proctors and Taxors; and\r\nfacing this the Bachelors’ school and the school of Medicine and Law;\r\nthe old “west room” having been converted into a school, by grace of the\r\nSenate, in 1547.[171]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The university library.]\r\n\r\nThe schools remained untouched till the opening years of the xviii\r\ncentury when the Regent House was pulled down to build the present\r\nuniversity library. This is the oldest of the three great English\r\nlibraries, and stands on ground which has always been university\r\nproperty. The early xv century library which was lodged in the Schools\r\nquadrangle originated in gifts of single volumes by private donors until\r\n52 had been collected; and books which were bequeathed in 1424 are still\r\npreserved. Fifty years later (1473) the proctors Ralph Sanger and\r\nRichard Tokerham made a catalogue of 330 books.[172] Rotherham\r\nArchbishop of York next presented 200 tomes, and Tunstall Bishop of\r\nDurham was another donor: many of these last gifts\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATEWAY OF KING’S COLLEGE, KING’S PARADE\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most picturesque views in Cambridge. On the right are\r\nthe Gateway and Screen and other portions of King’s College; on the left\r\nare some ancient houses.]\r\n\r\nwere “embezzled” by “pilferers” before the middle of the xvi\r\ncentury,[173] and the libraries of three successive Cambridge\r\narchbishops of Canterbury, Parker, Grindal, and Bancroft, formed the\r\nchief treasure of the university until 1715 when George I. purchased and\r\npresented the library of Moore Bishop of Ely which is the nucleus of the\r\nmodern collection.[174]\r\n\r\nThere are 400,000 volumes on open shelves among which the student can\r\nwander at will and get his own books without applying to the library\r\nofficials; a convenience which Lord Acton, the late Professor of Modern\r\nHistory, used to say made this the only serviceable library in Europe.\r\nAnother privilege, which is possessed by all masters of arts, is that\r\nbooks may be taken home. Undergraduates, if in academic dress, have also\r\nfree access. The university library is one of the three copyright\r\nlibraries in England.[175]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pitt Press.]\r\n\r\nA printing press was set up at Cambridge, early in the xvi century, by\r\nSiberch who said of himself that he was the first in England to print\r\nGreek--7 small volumes in the Greek character were printed by him at the\r\nuniversity. Carter, however, tells us that an Italian Franciscan,\r\nWilliam of Savona, printed a book at Cambridge in 1478, four years after\r\nCaxton had printed the first book in England. Lord Coke pointed out\r\nthat this university enjoyed before Oxford the privilege of printing\r\n_omnes et omnigenas libros_, “all and every kind of book” (1534). This\r\nincluded the right to appoint 3 stationers or printers.\r\n\r\nSiberch’s printing place was on the present site of Caius. In 1655 the\r\nuniversity obtained from Queens’ College a lease of the ground at the\r\ncorner of Silver street and Queens’ lane--the historic Mill street\r\ndistrict--now the site of the lodge and garden of S. Catherine’s. In\r\n1804 the present site was obtained for the university press, with a\r\nfurther “messuage fronting upon Trumpington street and Mill lane”; the\r\nremaining properties in Trumpington street, between Silver street and\r\nMill street, being bought in 1831-3. The Pitt Press, a church-like\r\nstructure, stands opposite to Pembroke (Pitt’s) College, and owes its\r\nname to the fact that the surplus funds of the Pitt monument in\r\nWestminster abbey were a donation to the university towards defraying\r\nthe cost. The building also contains the offices of the university\r\nRegistrary.[176]\r\n\r\nThe Senate House was not founded till 1722, and lies on the north of the\r\nlibrary.[177]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King’s College. A. D. 1441.]\r\n\r\nNinety years passed after the building of Corpus before Henry VI.\r\nfounded King’s College, and Margaret of Anjou, his consort, founded\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     KING’S COLLEGE CHAPEL AND THE ENTRANCE COURT, FROM THE FELLOWS’\r\n     BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nA portion of the Chapel is seen on the left of the picture with Great\r\nSt. Mary’s tower in the distance. The Screen and Gate are on the\r\nright.]\r\n\r\nQueens’. It was in 1443 that the charter of the double foundation of\r\nEton at Windsor and King’s College at Cambridge was signed--the one “our\r\nroyal college of S. Mary of Eton,” the other “our royal college of S.\r\nMary and S. Nicholas”; for Henry dedicated his college to his patron\r\nsaint Nicholas “of Bari” the patron of scholars. The king laid the\r\nfoundation stone himself (p. 112) in the presence of John Langton\r\nchancellor of the university, the keeper of the Privy Seal, the\r\nchancellor of the Exchequer, and the bishops of Lincoln and\r\nSalisbury.[178] The king’s father had intended to build a college at\r\nOxford; Henry VI. carried out his intention in endowing a college but\r\ndecided that the university should be Cambridge. A small college called\r\nGod’s House which had just been founded,[179] together with Mill Street\r\n(acquired in 1445) and Augustine’s hostel (in 1449) and the church of S.\r\nJohn Zachary, were pulled down to clear a space: but the original plan\r\nfor the college was never carried out, and the buildings we now see were\r\nerected in the first quarter of the xviiith and in the xixth\r\ncenturies.[180]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The chapel.]\r\n\r\nThe only portion of the original plan executed was the chapel. The\r\nimportance of King’s College chapel is not only architectural; is due\r\nnot only to the fact that it was begun before the Italian classical\r\nrevival as a monument of English Gothic, and completed in the full blaze\r\nof the renascence, but that it marks a chapter in the history of English\r\nreligion. The church built for the old worship was consecrated for the\r\nnew; the first stone was laid by Henry VI. in the presence of great\r\ncatholic prelates, the oaken screen--perhaps the finest woodwork in the\r\ncountry--bears the monogram of Henry VIII. and Anne Boleyn[181] twined\r\nwith true lovers’ knots. In the third place “this immense and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING’S COLLEGE CHAPEL AND THE FELLOWS’ BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nThe South door of the Chapel is seen to the right in the picture, and\r\nthe Fellows’ Buildings, constructed in 1723, are on the left.

David’s (now ruinous), is here carried out over a larger area\r\nthan anywhere else.[182]\r\n\r\n                      That branching roof\r\n    Self-poised, and scooped into ten thousand cells\r\n    Where light and shade repose, where music dwells\r\n    Lingering, and wandering on as loth to die--\r\n    Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof\r\n    That they were born for immortality.\r\n\r\nSo writes Wordsworth; and the stained glass windows, the most ‘complete\r\nand magnificent series’ in the country says Carter, probably inspired\r\nMilton’s\r\n\r\n   --storied windows richly dight,\r\n    Casting a dim religious light.\r\n    There let the pealing organ blow,\r\n    To the full voic’d quire below,\r\n    In service high, and anthems clear,\r\n    As may with sweetness through mine ear,\r\n    Dissolve me into ecstasies,\r\n    And bring all Heav’n before mine eyes.\r\n\r\nOn the death of the Lancastrian monarch, Edward IV. sequestrated the\r\nbuilding funds, but returned a thousand pounds later, and Richard III.\r\ncontributed £700; but it is Henry VII. who brought the work to\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\nKing’s is the only college in the university which receives only those\r\nstudents who intend to read for honours, and until 1857 its members\r\ncould claim the _B.A._ degree without presenting themselves for\r\nexamination.[183] The college was, almost immediately upon its\r\nfoundation, exempted not only from archiepiscopal and episcopal control\r\nbut also from the general jurisdiction\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING’S COLLEGE CHAPEL INTERIOR FROM THE CHOIR]\r\n\r\nof the university. It was endowed for the accommodation of a Provost, 70\r\npoor scholars, 10 secular priests, 16 choristers, and 6 clerks--a total\r\nof 103. Eton was designed for 132 inmates.[184] 24 of the 48\r\nscholarships of King’s are now open. Each of these scholarships is of\r\nthe annual value of £80. There are also 46 fellowships. The most\r\ncelebrated Etonians have not however been educated at King’s, among\r\nwhose eminent sons have been Croke, Cheke (of S. John’s) Provost,\r\nWoodlark the founder of S. Catherine’s, third Provost of the college and\r\nalso its benefactor, Sir John Harrington, Robert and Horace Walpole, Sir\r\nFrancis Walsingham, Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, Conisby, Haddon, Giles\r\nFletcher, Waller, Fleetwood, Oughtred an Etonian on the first\r\nfoundation, Whichcote (of Emmanuel) Provost, Upton, Cole, and Charles\r\nSimeon who was a life fellow. Nicholas Close (1551) and Aldrich (1537)\r\nboth bishops of Carlisle, the former one of the original six fellows,\r\nthe latter the intimate of Erasmus, Rotherham of York (1467) a fellow\r\nand a donor to the chapel fund, Fox of Hereford (1535), William and\r\nGeorge Day bishops of Winchester and Chichester, one provost of Eton the\r\nother of King’s, Wickham of Lincoln and Winchester,[185] Nicholas West\r\n(Bishop of Ely 1515) the friend of Fisher and More and Richard Cox\r\n(1559) both scholars of the college, Oliver King of Exeter, then of Bath\r\nand Wells (1492), Alley of Exeter, Guest of Rochester and Salisbury\r\n(1559), Goodrich of Ely (1534), Pearson, and Sumner, are among its\r\nprelates. Henry and Charles Brandon, heirs of their father the Duke of\r\nSuffolk, and nephews of Henry VIII. and both proficient scholars, died\r\nof the sweating sickness while in residence here in the reign of Edward\r\nVI. Cardinal Beaufort was a princely benefactor to the college, and John\r\nSomerset, physician to Henry VI., who came to Cambridge as an Oxford\r\nsophister and here graduated, was one of the chief instruments in its\r\nfoundation, and drew up its statutes.[186]\r\n\r\nThe college has produced several great schoolmasters, and is now\r\ngradually acquiring a reputation for historical studies, about one third\r\nof the students being history men. The dedication to S. Nicholas is only\r\nretained in formal descriptions: _King’s College_ has been by common\r\nconsent regarded as the fitting title for this truly royal foundation,\r\nand it recalls that still older King’s Hall which is now merged in\r\nTrinity.[187]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HALL OF KING’S COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThis was built by Wilkins 1824-28. On the walls are several portraits by\r\nSir Hubert Herkomer, R.A.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cambridge College chapels.]\r\n\r\nThe importance of King’s College chapel in university history since the\r\nxv century leads us to consider the rôle played in Cambridge by\r\ncollegiate chapels. Every college chapel, and every church which has an\r\nhistorical connexion with the university, has served--as all early\r\nChristian edifices have served--other purposes than those of religious\r\nworship. What we have to remark in Cambridge is that this ancient custom\r\ncontinued there longer than elsewhere. The “Commencements” which took\r\nplace later in the Senate House used to be held, as we have seen, in the\r\nfamous church of the Greyfriars or in that of the Austinfriars. The\r\nUniversity church--Great S. Mary’s--was used by the university for its\r\nassemblies in the xiii century and was the scene of all great civic\r\nfunctions; disputations were held in it on Elizabeth’s visit in 1564.\r\nThe college chapels were everywhere used for the transaction of\r\nimportant business; the Provost of King’s and other Masters are still\r\nelected in the chapel, documents are still sealed in the chapel of\r\nKing’s and Trinity, and the Thurston speech is still pronounced in the\r\nchapel of Caius. The choir of King’s was used for degree examinations as\r\nlate as 1851, and declamations are even now held in the chapel at\r\nTrinity. Indeed the “exercises of learning” “used” in the chapels was\r\nthe reason given by the Corpus men to Lord Bacon’s father when asking\r\nfor a church to themselves; and Queen Elizabeth witnessed the\r\n_Aulularia_ of Plautus in King’s chapel on Sunday August 6th 1564, as\r\nthe abbess and her nuns had assembled for Hrostwitha’s play in the abbey\r\nchurch of Gandersheim six hundred years earlier. The building of\r\ncolleges adjoining a parish church is a feature peculiar to Cambridge.\r\nMerton is the one exception at Oxford, and Pembroke is, as we have seen,\r\nthe only early exception to this rule at Cambridge.[188]\r\n\r\n     List of pre-reformation colleges built with chapels:--\r\n\r\n     1.

A.D. 1448.]\r\n\r\nThe charter for the foundation of Queens’ College is dated 15 April\r\n1448, but by this date its north and east ranges were already built.\r\nQueen Margaret of Anjou had been so impressed with the beauty and\r\nmajesty of the plans for King’s College that she could find no rest till\r\nshe had projected her own foundation--Queens’; to endow and perfect\r\nwhich she set to work with holy emulation; dedicating it in her turn to\r\nher patron saint, Margaret the legendary Virgin and Martyr whose body is\r\nshown at Montefiascone, and to Bernard of Citeaux. Two years previously\r\nthe principal of S. Bernard’s hostel had founded a college of S.\r\nBernard, the site of which he changed in 1447 to the present site of\r\nQueens’. This formed the moral nucleus of the queens’ college; but she\r\nobtained the larger part of the ground, near King’s, from the\r\nCarmelites. This is one of the three colleges in Cambridge built of red\r\nbrick, S. John’s and S. Catherine’s being the others. The Queens’\r\nquadrangle is, as Messieurs Willis and Clark tell us, the earliest now\r\nremaining which claims attention for its architectural beauty. It is 99\r\nfeet east and west by 84 north and south.[189] The plan is not only a\r\nvery perfect example of college architecture, but is a model of the xv\r\ncentury English manor-house, of the type of Haddon Hall;[190] so that\r\nQueens’ College is as homogeneous a structure as King’s is\r\nheterogeneous. The hall is on the west, adjoining it is the combination\r\nroom, above, the President’s lodging with a bedchamber over it. The\r\nnorth side is kept for the chapel and for the library which is on the\r\nfirst floor. The chambers are on the east and south sides, the gateway\r\nbeing in the former. As in other colleges the passage to the grounds\r\n(or, as in this case, to the second court) is between the hall and the\r\nbutteries. The west side of the quadrangle which was gradually\r\ncloistered forms the east side of the second court, and is washed by the\r\nCam. The beautiful gallery on the north has formed part of the lodge\r\nsince the xvi century,[191] and connects the old\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD COURT IN QUEENS’ COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThis is the Cloister Court. In the quaint sixteenth century buildings on\r\nthe left is the Gallery, and facing the spectator is the doorway into\r\nthe First Court. The Hall is seen on the right of this doorway.]\r\n\r\npresident’s lodging with a set of rooms on the west side, among which is\r\nthe audit room now used as a dining room.\r\n\r\nQueens’, like King’s, was originally built with a chapel, and in both\r\ninstances the foundation stone of the chapel was that of the college. A\r\nnew chapel and buildings now lie beyond the President’s garden on the\r\nnorth. There is a small court on the south of the cloister court which\r\ncontains the rooms occupied by Erasmus, overhanging the college kitchen.\r\nBesides Erasmus, who lived here for at least four years, Fisher was\r\nthere as President of the college until 1508, and Old Fuller was another\r\nof its worthies. Henry Bullock, the opposer of Protestantism and friend\r\nof Erasmus, was a fellow, so was Sir T. Smith; Bishop Pearson[192] and\r\nOckley _alumni_. Henry Hastings Earl of Huntingdon, whose portrait hangs\r\nin the audit room, Manners Earl of Rutland, George Duke of Clarence,\r\nCecilia Duchess of York, and Maud Countess of Oxford, were among its\r\nbenefactors. But its chief benefactor was Andrew Doket, a friar (of what\r\norder is not known) and its first President, who saved the fortunes of\r\nthe college after the fall of the House of Lancaster.[193] The picture\r\nof principal interest is also to be found in the lodge--Holbein’s\r\nportrait of Erasmus which was painted during a visit made at the\r\nscholar’s request to England.\r\n\r\nThe college was originally endowed for a president and 4 fellows, and\r\ntheir principal study was to be theology. There are now 11 fellowships,\r\nand about 18 scholarships which vary in value from £30 to £60.\r\n\r\nQueens’ College is a monument of peace. The Yorkist queen Elizabeth\r\nWoodville continued Margaret of Anjou’s work, and the two queens are the\r\nco-founders of the college. It is Elizabeth Woodville whose portrait\r\nlooks down upon us in the hall, and it was she who changed Queen\r\nMargaret’s dedication and called their joint work Queens’ College.[194]\r\nIt is also a monument to the unambitious but well-defined revival of\r\nlearning that marked the reign of Edward IV., of which Woodville Earl\r\nRivers, the queen’s brother, Tiptoft Earl of Worcester, and Caxton\r\nhimself are the representatives.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kingly visitors to the university.]\r\n\r\nBoth King’s and Queens’ Colleges have offered hospitality on several\r\noccasions to English sovereigns. Henry VI. came to lay the foundation\r\nstone of King’s in 1441 and was at King’s Hall in 1445-6 (when he laid\r\nthe foundation stone of his second college?), in 1448-9 and in\r\n1452-3.[195] Edward IV. visited the university in 1463 and 1476.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEENS’ COLLEGE FROM THE RIVER FRONT\r\n\r\nOn the left is seen the garden front of the President’s Lodge. The\r\nwooden bridge designed by Etheridge (1749) is known as the Mathematical\r\nBridge. In the distance are the two old mills--the King’s Mill and the\r\nBishop’s Mill.]\r\n\r\nHenry VII. paid five visits to Cambridge and stayed at Queens’ in 1498\r\nand again in 1506 when he occupied a chamber near the audit room. It was\r\non this occasion that he attended the service for the eve of S. George’s\r\nday in King’s College chapel clad in the robes of the Garter. Henry\r\nVIII. was by his father’s side during this visit, and came again in\r\n1522. Mary came as far as Sir Robert Huddleston’s when Jane Grey was\r\nproclaimed. Elizabeth was entertained in the Provost’s lodge of King’s,\r\nand it was when repairing to her rooms there after the solemn service in\r\nthe chapel that she thanked God “that had sent her to this university\r\nwhere she was so received as she thought she could not be better.” James\r\nI. visited Cambridge twice in 1615 and was again at Trinity College in\r\n1623 and 1624; Charles I. (who had been Nevile’s guest in 1613) was\r\nentertained there in 1632 and 1642; and Charles II. in the long gallery\r\nat S. John’s in 1681. Anne was there in 1705, George I. in 1717, and\r\nGeorge II. in 1728. Queen Victoria came in 1843 and again in 1847 when\r\nthe Prince Consort was installed as Chancellor; and Edward VII. visited\r\nthe university in February 1904.\r\n\r\nJohn had been in Cambridge the month before his death, September 1216;\r\nHenry III. was there in the second year of his reign (1218); Edward I.\r\nwas there as Prince of Wales in 1270, and lodged again in the castle in\r\n1294. Edward II. was the guest of Barnwell priory in 1326. Edward III.\r\nwas there in September 1328. Richard II. was also lodged at Barnwell in\r\n1388.\r\n\r\nThe Conqueror had been at Cambridge in 1070.\r\n\r\nMatilda is the first queen-consort whom we can picture visiting the\r\nuniversity town; Eleanor of Castile was frequently at Walsingham with\r\nEdward,[196] and she gave as we shall see a “chest” to the university.\r\nMargaret of Anjou was never there, but Elizabeth Woodville came in 1468.\r\nThe mother of Henry VII. also came to see her college in 1505 and again\r\nwith the king in 1506. Elizabeth of York accompanied Henry VII. in 1498;\r\nCatherine of Aragon slept at Queens’ in 1519; and Henrietta Maria was\r\nwith the king in 1631-2.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe erection of King’s and Queens’ Colleges opened a period of college\r\nbuilding which lasted sixty years, and closed with the foundation of S.\r\nJohn’s (in 1509).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: S. Catherine’s College, 1473.]\r\n\r\nIn 1473 Robert Woodlark chancellor of the university and third provost\r\nof King’s, and one of the original scholars of that foundation, built a\r\nsmall college dedicated to the Glorious Virgin Martyr S. Catherine of\r\nAlexandria, with the object of extending “the usefulness of Church\r\npreaching, and the study of theology, philosophy, and other arts within\r\nthe Church of England.” The present red brick structure was erected two\r\nhundred years later, this being the only college except Clare which has\r\nbeen entirely rebuilt since its foundation. S. Catherine’s, or “Cat’s”\r\nas the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATEWAY OF ST. CATHERINE’S COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThis is a view of the old Renaissance Gateway (1679), being the entrance\r\nto the College from Queens’ Lane.] undergraduate familiarly calls it,\r\nis remarkable for the number of bishops it has educated, among whom were\r\nArchbishop Sandys, May of Carlisle, Brownrigg of Exeter, all of whom\r\nwere Masters of the college, as was Overall of Norwich who migrated from\r\nS. John’s: John Lightfoot, the orientalist, was its 16th Master, and\r\nStrype (who came here from Jesus), James Shirley the last of the\r\ndramatists,[197] Ray the naturalist, and Addenbrooke the founder of the\r\nwell known hospital of that name at Cambridge, were also educated here.\r\n\r\nThe hall[198] was founded for a master and 3 fellows, and now maintains\r\n6 fellows and 26 scholars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jesus College 1495.]\r\n\r\nThe next college is a solitary instance of the adaptation of monastic\r\narchitecture to collegiate purposes in Cambridge. Alcock Bishop of Ely\r\nand joint lord chancellor with Rotherham obtained from Alexander VI.\r\n(1496/7) the dissolution of the ancient Benedictine nunnery of S.\r\nRhadegund, and founded there a college which he dedicated to the\r\n_Blessed Virgin Mary, S. John Evangelist, and the glorious Virgin S.\r\nRhadegund_. Its name of Jesus College records the growing cult of the\r\nname of Jesus, and the substitution was approved by the founder\r\nhimself.[199]\r\n\r\nIf at Queens’ we are in a xv century manor-house, at Jesus we are in a\r\nmonastery; and might well imagine ourselves for a moment back in one of\r\nthe busiest centres of old Cambridge if we pace the cloisters just\r\nbefore hall time when the stir is suggestive of the life of a great\r\nmonastery. Even the legend “Song Room” over a doorway falls in with the\r\nillusion. James I. said that if he lived in the university he would pray\r\nat King’s, eat at Trinity, and study and sleep at Jesus.\r\n\r\nThe chapel is the original conventual church[200] as rebuilt by Alcock.\r\nIt contains xii century work, and represents the transition from Norman\r\nto Early English. The character of the college has been consistently\r\nevangelical in spite of the fact that Bancroft the Laudian archbishop\r\nbefore Laud, was here, and that he migrated here from Christ’s on\r\naccount of the latter’s reputation for Puritanism. Cranmer was scholar,\r\nand fellow until his marriage, and was readmitted fellow when his wife\r\ndied a year later. Archbishops Bancroft and Sterne, Laurence Sterne,\r\nBale Bishop of Ossory, Strype, Fulke Greville, Fenton, Fawkes (the\r\npoet), Hartley, and S. T. Coleridge were members. The college which was\r\nfounded for 6 fellows and 6 scholars, now maintains 16 fellows and some\r\n20 scholars. The statutes\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATEWAY OF JESUS COLLEGE]\r\n\r\nwere indited by James Stanley Bishop of Ely, stepson of Lady Margaret,\r\nand modified by his successor Nicholas West. Jesus College scholars were\r\ncommended by the founder to the perpetual tutelage of the bishops of\r\nEly, who when they lie there are said to lie in their own house.[201]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Christ’s College A.D. 1505.]\r\n\r\nTen years later a most interesting foundation was made. A college called\r\nGod’s House had, as we have seen, been founded in the reign of Henry VI.\r\nand was appropriated by that monarch as part of the site of King’s\r\nCollege. The foundation was a far-off echo of the plague in the previous\r\ncentury, and when the king took possession of the site he appears to\r\nhave intended to endow a considerable college in its place in the parish\r\nof S. Andrew where he erected another God’s House.[202] It was this\r\ndesign, left unfulfilled (for the house only supported four of the\r\nsixty scholars whom Henry VI. had himself proposed to maintain there)\r\nthat John Fisher, chancellor of the university and Bishop of Rochester,\r\nbrought to the notice of Lady Margaret Beaufort, daughter of the first\r\nDuke of Somerset, Countess of Richmond and Derby, the wife of Edmund\r\nTudor and mother of Henry VII.; and on the site of God’s House she\r\nerected her own Christ’s College, and made John Sickling its Proctor\r\nfirst Master. The quadrangle was encased in stone in the xviii century,\r\nbut the gateway with its statue and armorials of the founder, and the\r\noriel over the entrance to the Master’s lodge recall the founder’s time.\r\nFacing the gateway are the hall, the old combination room, and the\r\nlodge, and above were a set of rooms reserved for the founder’s own use;\r\na turret staircase led therefrom to both hall and garden, as was the\r\ncustom in a master’s lodge. On the east of this “Tree court” is a\r\nbuilding in the renascence style, thought to be one of the finest\r\nexamples in England, and to have been the work of Inigo Jones (1642).\r\nThe gold plate of the college was a bequest of Lady Margaret’s and there\r\nis none finer in the university. Christ’s is also noted for its gardens.\r\n\r\nNo college has been richer in great men. Milton was here for seven\r\nyears, Henry More the Platonist, Latimer the scholar-bishop and martyr,\r\nLeland the antiquary, Nicholas Saunderson, Paley of the “Evidences,”\r\nArchbishops Grindal and Bancroft, Bishop Porteous,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GATEWAY OF CHRIST’S COLLEGE FROM ST. ANDREW’S STREET\r\n\r\nThe Gateway is coeval with the founding of the College, and dates from\r\nthe first decade of the sixteenth century.]\r\n\r\nSir Walter Mildmay,[203] Charles Darwin, and Sir John Seeley. Lightfoot\r\nthe great Hebraist of his century, and Cudworth, were both Masters in\r\nthe xvii century; and in the previous century Exmew the Carthusian\r\nmartyr (1535) and Richard Hall (afterwards Canon of Cambray), Fisher’s\r\nbiographer, were inmates. Here Milton wrote his hymn on the Nativity,\r\nand here he formed his friendship with Edward King--fellow of the\r\ncollege--in whose memory _Lycidas_ was written.\r\n\r\nThe college was endowed for 12 fellows at least, half of whom were to\r\nhail from those northern counties in which both Lady Margaret and Fisher\r\nwere interested; the total endowment was for 60 persons. There are now\r\n15 fellowships, 30 scholarships (£30 to £70) and some 4 sizarships of\r\nthe value of £50 a year.[204]\r\n\r\nGrammar, the original study of God’s House,[205] and arts were to be\r\nstudied in addition to theology, but excluding law and medicine; and for\r\nthe first time in college statutes lectures on the classical orators and\r\npoets are provided for, an attention to polite letters for their own\r\nsake which is supposed to have been due to the influence of Erasmus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Lady Margaret.]\r\n\r\nThe Lady Margaret, for with this title alone her memory is preserved at\r\nboth universities, has, perhaps, no rival in Cambridge as both an\r\ninteresting and an important figure in its history. She appears to have\r\nbeen one of the first in that age to understand that the university was\r\nto replace the monastery as the channel of English learning, and to\r\nendow colleges rather than religious houses. The two splendid\r\nfoundations which owe their existence to her bear upon them a stronger\r\npersonal impress than others. Alone of non-resident founders she\r\nretained for her own use a lodge in the college she founded. An anecdote\r\nwhen she was staying at Christ’s, preserved for us by Fuller, comes\r\nacross the centuries vivid with her personality. There is no episode in\r\nany university to compare with the scholastic partnership of Lady\r\nMargaret and Bishop Fisher, her chaplain, perpetual chancellor of the\r\nuniversity, and Master of Michaelhouse. Both were in their measure\r\n“reformers before the reformation,” both joined to the spirit of piety\r\nan abounding appreciation of the spirit of knowledge. At Cambridge and\r\nOxford she founded those readerships in theology known as the Lady\r\nMargaret Professorships, and at Cambridge she instituted the Lady\r\nMargaret preachership. She died on 29 June 1509, and Erasmus wrote her\r\nepitaph in Westminster Abbey.[206]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cardinal Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, and perpetual\r\nchancellor of the university.]\r\n\r\nFisher lived many years after her, and completed the foundation of S.\r\nJohn’s.

John’s, he was led out to die on June 22,\r\n1534, the New Testament in his hand open at the words: “This is eternal\r\nlife, to know Thee the only true God.” He stands alone among the bishops\r\nof England to give his life for the principle for which the layman\r\nThomas More laid down his. Pole in a letter to Charles V. narrates that\r\nHenry VIII. had said he supposed “that I” (Pole) “had never in all my\r\ntravels met one who in letters and virtue could be compared to the\r\nBishop of Rochester.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: S. John’s College, A.D. 1509.]\r\n\r\nWe next come to the most splendid foundation hitherto realised at\r\nCambridge. The site chosen for a college which held its place through\r\nthe xvi century as the first and most brilliant society in the\r\nuniversity, could not have been more appropriate. It was that of S.\r\nJohn’s Hospital, the first home of Cambridge students, the nucleus of\r\nthe university, erected soon after the Conquest in the heart of the\r\nNorman town, and whence the first endowed scholars in christendom set\r\nforth to found a college.[208]\r\n\r\nThe whole history of the university is epitomised in the street which\r\nhas S. John’s at one end of it and Peterhouse at the other: the bishops\r\nof Ely have firm hold of either end, and lying against S. John’s is that\r\nPythagoras House which Merton bought from the Dunnings when he was\r\nplanning his famous foundation in the xiii century. We have seen that it\r\nwas at S. John’s Hospital that Balsham introduced secular scholars in\r\nthe same century, who should become _unum corpus et unum collegium_ with\r\nthe canons. The experiment did not succeed, and the canons saw the\r\nscholars depart with great relief to the other end of what was to prove\r\nthe great street of colleges, whose limits were determined by this early\r\nconflict between seculars and religious.\r\n\r\nIn what year the Ely scholars were settled at S. John’s remains\r\nuncertain, although there is no more important date in Cambridge\r\nhistory. Simon Montacute, Bishop of Ely, “who knew very well” as the\r\nhistorian of S. John’s observes, says that the scholars had continued\r\nthere _per longa tempora_, and Baker\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILTON’S MULBERRY TREE IN THE FELLOWS’ GARDEN, CHRIST’S\r\nCOLLEGE\r\n\r\nKing James I. is said to have introduced the culture of the mulberry\r\ntree, and it is probable that the one in this garden is the last\r\nsurvivor of a number bought in 1609. Milton was admitted to this College\r\nin 1625.]\r\n\r\nconsiders that in no construction of words can this be understood\r\notherwise than as referring to the beginning of Hugh Balsham’s prelacy\r\nat Ely.[209] The licence permitting the seculars to be engrafted on the\r\nold stock with their own endowment, is dated the ninth year of Edward I.\r\n(1280)[210] and the transference to Peterhouse took place three years\r\nafter; but the date of the royal licence is no proof that the work to\r\nwhich it refers was initiated rather than completed and crowned in that\r\nyear; Margaret of Anjou, for example, obtained her licence when three\r\nsides of the quadrangle at Queens’ were nearing completion.[211] In any\r\ncase the few months intervening between December 23, 1280 and the\r\ndecision to remove to Peterhouse could not be described as a “long\r\ntime,” and as Balsham had become bishop of the diocese in 1257 it is\r\nmost probable that he at once set about what it must certainly be\r\nsupposed he had at heart while still subprior of Ely.\r\n\r\nWith S. John’s we have the first of the large colleges. Henceforth\r\nTrinity and John’s are “the big colleges” the others are “the 14 small\r\ncolleges.” It now consists of four large courts, three of which are of\r\nbrickwork. The first court was erected between 1509-1616 on the pattern\r\nof the quadrangle at Christ’s. The founder’s grandson Henry VIII., whose\r\ncoronation she lived to witness, not only sequestrated a large part of\r\nthe funds she had destined for the building, but fifteen years later\r\nbeheaded Fisher her executor. The latter himself subscribed to the fund\r\nand was able before he died to erect a college for a Master and 21\r\nfellows--the original design being for 50 fellows. But what thus fell\r\nshort of the spirit of the earlier design has since been amply repaired,\r\nand a series of benefactors have made the college one of the most useful\r\nin England, with that large influence on the nation and large power of\r\nhelping poorer students which its founders had so greatly at heart.\r\n\r\nThe Second Court was built chiefly at the expense of Mary Countess of\r\nShrewsbury in 1595-1620. The Third Court was begun in 1623, with funds\r\nprovided by Williams then Bishop of Lincoln, and finished by benefactors\r\nsome of whom remained anonymous. The last Court was built in 1826 and is\r\njoined to the college by the “Bridge of Sighs.” Beyond this is the\r\nbeautiful “wilderness” commemorated by Wordsworth.\r\n\r\n   ---- Scarcely Spenser’s self\r\n    Could have more tranquil visions in his youth\r\n\r\nhe tells us, than he had had loitering in Cambridge nights under a\r\n“fairy work of earth,” a certain lovely ash, wreathed in ivy. This is\r\nthe site of the infirmary of the canons, the only portion of whose\r\nHospital to be preserved was adapted as a college infirmary and was at\r\nthe north side of the First Court: it was destroyed in 1863 when the\r\npresent large chapel was built, which is the work of Gilbert Scott, and\r\nis 193 feet long. The large hall\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GATEWAY AND TOWER OF ST. JOHN’S COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThe Kirke White memorial is seen in the foreground, and behind it are\r\nthe Divinity Schools; to the left is the Gateway of St. John’s, with the\r\nTower behind it. The enclosed space in the foreground was formerly the\r\nsite of All Saints’ Church, pulled down in 1865.]\r\n\r\nmeasures 108 feet, and the portrait of Lady Margaret presides over the\r\nhigh table. The new combination room, which is now entered from the\r\nsecond court, was built in 1864, and is 93 feet long. The west side of\r\nthe Third Court is cloistered, and from here leads the covered bridge,\r\ncalled from its resemblance to the bridge at Venice “the Bridge of\r\nSighs.” The stone bridge near it supplanted the old timber bridge in\r\n1696. As at Queens’, there is a long gallery on the first floor of the\r\nSecond Court. Nowhere has the original modest “master’s lodging”\r\nundergone more change than here. The lodging--two rooms over the old\r\ncombination room, with an oriel, on the first court--was gradually\r\nextended, again as at Queens’, along the gallery, and ran along part of\r\nthe next court. Finally Scott built the present lodge, outside the\r\ncourts altogether.\r\n\r\nChrist’s and S. John’s are both profusely ornamented with the Tudor and\r\nBeaufort badges of the founder, and with her name-device the\r\n_marguerite_.[212] The ancient gateway has a canopied statue of the\r\nEvangelist. To the north and south of the new chapel porch are statues\r\nof Lady Margaret and of Fisher, and 16 statues of the benefactors and\r\ngreat members of the college: Mary Cavendish Countess of Shrewsbury,\r\nSarah Alston Duchess of Somerset, Williams Archbishop of York, and\r\nLinacre who founded the Physics lecture here and at Merton Oxford,\r\nappear among the former. Among the latter are Roger Ascham (fellow)\r\n(those asterisked are effigied); Sir John Cheke (fellow); *Bentley;\r\n*Cecil Lord Burleigh; *Lucius Lord Falkland[213]; Fairfax, the\r\nparliamentary general; *Wentworth Lord Strafford; *Stillingfleet,\r\n*Overall,[214] *Gunning, and Selwyn, prelates; *William Gilbert; *Brook\r\nTaylor the naturalist; *Clarkson the opponent of the slave trade; Cave\r\nthe ecclesiastical historian; Metcalfe the most brilliant of its\r\nmasters[215]; Matthew Prior, Grindal the classic, Cecil Lord Salisbury,\r\nBen Jonson, Wordsworth, Kirke White, Rowland Hill, Henry Martyn the\r\nmissionary, Horne Tooke, Castlereagh, Palmerston, Wilberforce, Erasmus\r\nDarwin, Colenso, Herschell, Liveing, Adams the discoverer of Neptune,\r\nBenjamin Hall Kennedy, and *Baker the historian of the college. Fisher\r\narranged a small chapel leading from the college chapel for his own\r\nresting place.[216] The site of S. John’s chapel is as old an\r\necclesiastical site as Jesus chapel: the xvi century edifice was\r\nconstructed close to the xii century canons’ church, and the fine modern\r\nchapel is on the same site.\r\n\r\nThe licence for the college dates from 1511; the building was opened in\r\n1516; and the statutes were drawn up by Fisher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO ST. JOHN’S COLLEGE CHAPEL FROM THE FIRST\r\nCOURT\r\n\r\nIn the corner on the right is seen the Doorway of the Chapel, with the\r\ntower rising above it.

John’s Hospital there was a site traditionally connected with\r\nthe lectures of Abbot Joffred’s monks in 1109, and which in fact was\r\nafterwards Crowland Abbey property. When a monastic order possessed no\r\nconvent in a university town, the monks were obliged to reside in\r\nlodgings, and this led, as we have already seen (i. p. 49) to the\r\nfoundation of monastic hostels for their reception. There were two such\r\nhostels at Cambridge--Ely hostel and Monks’ hostel. Ely hostel was the\r\ndirect outcome of Benedict XII.’s Constitution in 1337[217] which\r\nreconfirmed an earlier injunction of Honorius III. 1216-27 requiring the\r\nBenedictines and Augustinians to send students in rotation from the\r\nmonastery to the university, and provided that monks should live at the\r\nuniversities under a prior of Benedictines. It was purchased in 1340 (or\r\nearlier) by John de Crawden prior of Ely for the Ely monks and was made\r\nover to Bateman Bishop of Norwich seven years later for his foundation\r\nof Trinity Hall.\r\n\r\nEly then had been the pioneer in providing this accommodation, which\r\nserved for Ely monks alone, and which, as we see, was speedily\r\nabolished. Those few Houses which still elected to send their monks to\r\nCambridge[218] maintained them there thenceforth under the care of “the\r\nprior of students”; and it was owing to the energy of one of these\r\nCambridge priors that Monks’ hostel was projected in 1428, at a time\r\nwhen, as is then stated, no house existed for Crowland or other\r\nBenedictine monks, and the religious either shared the hostels with\r\nseculars or lived in lodgings in the town. The site for Monks’ hostel\r\nconsisted of two messuages granted in that year to the abbot of Crowland\r\nby the Cambridge burgesses. Crowland, Ely, Ramsey, and Walden each built\r\nportions for their own students.[219] Nearly a hundred years later, on\r\nthe eve of the Reformation, Edward Stafford Duke of Buckingham refounded\r\nthis hostel as Buckingham College. It was not\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SECOND COURT OF ST. JOHN’S COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThe doorway on the right leads into the First Court. The Dining Hall is\r\nin the building on the right and the Combination Room on the left of the\r\npicture. In the background is the Chapel Tower with the sunset light\r\nupon it]\r\n\r\ncompleted at the time of his attainder two years afterwards (1521) and\r\nthe property escheated in due course as a cell of Crowland Abbey to the\r\ncrown.[220]\r\n\r\nHow soon Monks’ hostel became “the monks’ hostel of Buckingham” is by no\r\nmeans clear. That the Dukes of Buckingham were early patrons must be\r\nadmitted on the evidence; for even if the house was not known as\r\nBuckingham College in 1465, it was known as “the hostel called Bokyngham\r\ncollege” in 1483 while it was still Crowland property, and both hall and\r\nchapel were probably the gift of “deep revolving, witty Buckingham” the\r\nsecond Duke Henry.\r\n\r\n“I have in this world sustained great damage and injury in serving the\r\nking’s highness, which this grant shall recompense.” So wrote Lord\r\nChancellor Audley in a letter begging for a share of the plunder when\r\nHenry had determined on the suppression of the monasteries. The share he\r\nwanted and got was Walden Abbey in Essex on the borders of\r\nCambridgeshire, and here he established himself on the site which his\r\nson was to transform into the mansion of Audley-End. He did more; he\r\nproposed to himself, apparently, some sort of expiation to balance the\r\n“recompense,” and in 1542 changed Buckingham into Magdalene College\r\nwhich he re-endowed. We have seen that Walden Abbey was itself one of\r\nthe builders of Monks’ hostel.\r\n\r\nThe mastership of the college is in the gift of the owner of Audley-End\r\n(now Lord Braybrooke). Nothing of the xv century building remains. A\r\nwindow of Pugin’s adorns the chapel[221] replacing the old altar-piece\r\nwhich is now in the library. The combination room leads from the\r\nmusicians’ gallery of the pleasant hall, the only instance of this\r\narrangement in Cambridge.[222] In the time of Fuller, Magdalene was a\r\ncollege of reading men: “The scholars of this college, though farthest\r\nfrom the schools, were in my time the first to be observed there, and to\r\nas good purpose as any.”[223] Twenty years ago it was the fashionable\r\ncollege, and its members lived in private lodgings, attending neither\r\nhall nor chapel. Magdalene is in the parish of S. Giles, and it has been\r\nconjectured that it occupies the site of the house of the canons of S.\r\nGiles before they removed to Barnwell. There is however no evidence for\r\nthis, and there are no documents at Magdalene earlier than Stafford’s\r\ntime.[224]\r\n\r\nArchbishop Grindal,[225] Robert Rede chief justice in 1509, Cumberland\r\nBishop of Peterborough, and Kingsley were educated here. So was Pepys,\r\nthe diarist, who bequeathed to the college his extraordinary\r\ncollection\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COMBINATION ROOM, ST. JOHN’S COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThis Gallery is used by the Fellows and is 93 feet long. It contains\r\nportraits of many College worthies. The approach to it is by a Turret\r\nStaircase in the Second Court. Its panelled walls and rich plaster-work\r\nceiling make it one of the finest specimens of its kind left in\r\nEngland.]\r\n\r\nof books, engravings, maps, and plans. The Pepysian library is now\r\npreserved in a separate hall, in the donor’s own bookshelves constructed\r\nafter a plan of his own. It is by far the most interesting thing in the\r\ncollege, and would be unique anywhere. It is to be hoped we may soon\r\nhave an official catalogue of its contents.\r\n\r\nMagdalene is a small college, it has about 40 inmates, of whom 5 are\r\nfellows. In Fuller’s time it held 140 persons, 11 being fellows and 22\r\nscholars, the rest being as usual the college officers, domestics, and\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trinity College A.D. 1546.]\r\n\r\nWith Trinity College are joined together in indissoluble matrimony the\r\ntwo great periods of college building, and the culminating point of the\r\nrenascence is reached: so that Trinity, alone, represents Cambridge\r\narchitecturally and morally in its historical character of a university\r\nof the rebirth from its dawn to its meridian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King’s Hall A.D. 1337.]\r\n\r\nWhen Henry VIII., whose effigy adorns the great gate, proposed to make a\r\nvast college on this site, he was proposing to expand the “great\r\ncollege” built by Edward III. whose effigy graces the older gateway\r\nwithin the court. Edward II. had maintained thirteen students at\r\nCambridge as early as 1317 and the number was increased later to\r\nthirty-two: it was however left to his son to carry out the design of a\r\n“House-of-Scholars of the King.”[226] We have already had frequently to\r\nrefer to this building, in which new interest has been awakened since\r\nthe restoration (in 1904-6) of part of the old Hall lying behind King\r\nEdward’s gateway towards the bowling green, and presenting architectural\r\nfeatures fully justifying its xiv century fame as the most considerable\r\ncollegiate enterprise thitherto undertaken. The Hall lay to the north\r\nwest of the present quadrangle, covering the space now occupied by the\r\nante-chapel,[227] Edward’s gate, and the Master’s lodge. The acquisition\r\nof the site affords a most interesting glimpse into contemporary\r\nCambridge history: for no site represented such various interests and\r\nrecalled so many of the great local names. The first plot of ground\r\nobtained was a messuage of Robert de Croyland’s in 1336. Eight years\r\nlater Edmund Walsyngham’s house was purchased; the house of Sir John de\r\nCambridge who was knight of the shire and alderman of the guild of S.\r\nMary was sold to the college in 1350 by his son Thomas; and the next\r\nyear saw the purchase from Thomas son of Sir Constantine de Mortimer, of\r\na waste parcel of land next the river and S. John’s Hospital, called the\r\nCornhythe, which abutted on the last named property. Croyland’s and\r\nWalsyngham’s houses were first adapted, and formed a small irregular\r\nquadrangle. Later in the xiv century a new (irregular) court was\r\nconstructed on the north of the present chapel. The original entrance\r\nwas situated where the sundial now is; here stood the Great Gate, the\r\npresent\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LIBRARY WINDOW, ST. JOHN’S COLLEGE, FROM THE BRIDGE\r\nOF SIGHS\r\n\r\nFrom this spot beautiful views are obtained up and down the river.]\r\n\r\nEntrance Gate being built as late as 1535 to give King’s Hall a frontage\r\non the High Street. The Hall rebuilt in the later xiv century and added\r\nto in the xvth was however only the nucleus of Henry VIII.’s college. To\r\nthe south west stood Michaelhouse; this too was absorbed in the new\r\nbuilding, and its second dedication to the holy and undivided Trinity\r\nwas retained in Henry’s college. Seven other buildings--all university\r\nhostels--were also absorbed--Gregory’s, Crouched, Physwick, S.\r\nMargaret’s, Tyled, Gerard’s, and Oving’s. The present kitchen occupies\r\npart of the site of Michaelhouse; Physwick stood between the Queen’s\r\nGate and Trinity Street; and the other hostels were grouped round these\r\nin S. Michael’s and King’s Hall Lanes.[228]\r\n\r\nThe work which had been begun by Lady Margaret at Christ’s and S.\r\nJohn’s--the final substitution of the college for the monastery\r\nschool--was now completed by her grandson, the great despoiler of the\r\nmonasteries, who appears to have designed Trinity College as a splendid\r\natonement for the destruction of so many homes of learning. It was\r\nlargely endowed with abbey lands, and Henry’s undeniable interest in\r\nerudition seems to have found its ultimate satisfaction in a foundation\r\ninto which there entered every element of that “new learning” which was\r\nhumanistic before it was Protestant. That provision was here to be made\r\nfor a wider field of knowledge than any hitherto contemplated in or out\r\nof a university, seems amply proved by the words of the founder; who,\r\nafter declaring that the college is intended for the “development and\r\nperpetuation of religion” (a well-chosen form of words?), continues\r\nthus: “_for the cultivation of wholesome study in all departments of\r\nlearning, knowledge of languages_, the education of youth in piety,\r\nvirtue, self-restraint, and knowledge; charity towards the poor, and the\r\nrelief of the afflicted and distressed.” The programme was so liberal\r\nthat Mary herself endowed the college with monastic property, and\r\nElizabeth completed the chapel which her sister had begun.\r\n\r\nNo building, indeed, in either university suggests in the same way and\r\nin the same degree that delightful mental combination of form and space\r\nwhich is the mark of the “Cambridge mind” in science if it is not so in\r\nliterature. As we pass into the great court the buildings we see neither\r\nshut out the light nor hem in the thoughts. The enclosure they suggest\r\nis that formal enclosure of point and line which enables us to make\r\npropositions about infinity. Of all scholastic buildings in the world\r\nthe great court of Trinity is that which best suggests the majesty and\r\nspaciousness of learning. Here one receives an impression of adequacy,\r\nbalance, clearness, spaciousness, elevation, serenity, a certain high\r\npower of the imagination--the mathematical qualities, the qualities of\r\nthe seeker after truth: an impression of the simple force of what is\r\nsimply clear, the simple grandeur of that which can dispense with the\r\nmysterious; of the dignity which accompanies those who have looked upon\r\nthings as\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD GATEWAY AND BRIDGE\r\n\r\nThese buildings form part of St. John’s College, and look on to the\r\nriver. The Tower of the College Chapel is seen in the background.]\r\n\r\nthey are in themselves, and have nothing adventitious to offer, yet what\r\nthey offer holds a curious power of satisfying.\r\n\r\nDoes a man see all this as he walks into Trinity and learn from it the\r\nlesson which Cambridge spreads before him, or does he take it with him\r\nunder the gateway and let Trinity Great Court represent for him what he\r\nalready knows of Cambridge? What does it matter whether it suggests so\r\nmuch or is allowed to represent so much?\r\n\r\nTrinity Great Court covers more than 90,000 square feet--an area of over\r\n2 acres--and is the largest in any college. The building, carried out\r\nunder Edward VI., received considerable modification during the\r\nmastership of Nevile (1593-1615) dean of Canterbury, who arranged the\r\ncourt on its present plan, erected the “Queen’s gateway” and the fine\r\nrenascence fountain, enlarged the original lodge, and built the hall and\r\nkitchen. On the west side, facing us as we enter, is the hall (1604)\r\nwhich was modelled on that of the Middle Temple. Next it are two\r\ncombination rooms--the centre for generations of Cambridge fellows who\r\nfirst had their assembling room in King’s Hall hard by[229]--but the\r\nfaçade here was spoiled in the xviii century when the oriel and frontage\r\nof the old hall of Michaelhouse were removed. A Jacobean porch leads us\r\ninto the lodge, which occupies the site of King’s Hall lodge. The great\r\nscholar Bentley, Master from 1700 to 1742, built the staircase and\r\notherwise left his mark here. His excursions into the classical were,\r\nhowever, curtailed during the mastership of Whewell (1840) when\r\nAlexander Beresford Hope subscribed to restore the Gothic character of\r\nthe front and built the picturesque oriel.[230] The inscription stating\r\nthat he had restored its ancient aspect to the house during the\r\nmastership of Whewell gave rise to the following amusing paraphrase:--\r\n\r\n    This is the House that Hope built.\r\n    This is the Master, rude and rough,\r\n    Who lives in the House that Hope built.\r\n    These are the seniors, greedy and gruff,\r\n    Who toady the Master, rude and rough,\r\n    Who lives in the House that Hope built.[231]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1555-1564.]\r\n\r\nThe chapel, on the north, was built by Mary, and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEPYS’ LIBRARY, MAGDALENE COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThis range of old buildings houses the Pepysian Library. The style is\r\nseventeenth century.]\r\n\r\nis one of the few churches erected in her reign, as Trinity College is\r\nitself one of the few places where her name is held in affection. Though\r\nit has none of the greatness of King’s chapel, it yields to none in\r\ninterest. The site is that of the chapel of King’s Hall built for the\r\nscholars by Edward IV., the materials of which, with stone from the\r\nGreyfriars’ house, the fen abbey of Ramsey, and Peterhouse, and lead\r\nfrom the Greyfriars and Mildenhall, were used in the construction.\r\nElizabeth completed it nine years later (1564). The ante-chapel contains\r\nthe statue of Newton,\r\n\r\n     ---- with his prism and silent face,\r\n    The marble index of a mind for ever\r\n    Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone\r\n\r\na work of Roubiliac’s considered by Chantrey to be the noblest of\r\nEnglish statues. Bacon, Barrow, Macaulay, and Whewell have also statues\r\nhere, while Richard Porson is commemorated by a bust. Along the wall\r\nwhich faces us as we enter are sixteen memorial brasses chiefly to\r\nremarkable fellows of the college who have died within the last twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe great court leads in the usual way, by hall and butteries, to\r\nNevile’s court, another work of Dr. Nevile’s, and here the library--to\r\nthe building of which Newton contributed--was erected by subscription,\r\nthe foundation stone being laid on February 26, 1676. The architect was\r\nWren who also designed the bookcases of the “stately library” as those\r\nwho had determined on its foundation had called it in anticipation. The\r\nwood of the cases is Norway oak which has been stained to imitate cedar.\r\nThe building is very rich with decoration inside and out; the length is\r\n194 feet as compared with the chapel 210 feet and the hall 100 feet. The\r\nstaircase and pavement are of marble. Pedestals with busts of members of\r\nthe college line the room on either side. The library contains 90,000\r\nvolumes, with 1900 MSS. including a Sarum missal on vellum of 1500,\r\nMilton’s rough draft notes of “Paradise Lost,” the _Codex Augiensis_ of\r\nPaul’s Epistles, four MSS. of Wyclif’s bible, and the Canterbury\r\npsalter.[232]\r\n\r\nA New Court, to which George IV. contributed, was erected in the first\r\nquarter of the xix century and Dr. Whewell built, at his own expense,\r\nthe Master’s Court. Upon the site of Garret’s hostel, the then bishop of\r\nLichfield erected in 1670 a small building known as “Bishop’s hostel”\r\nwhich is used as students’ quarters, and the proceeds of letting it are\r\nspent according to the founder’s direction in the purchase of books for\r\nthe library. Macaulay “kept” here when he first went up to Cambridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GATEWAY OF TRINITY COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThe Great Entrance Gate, constructed about 1518-35. The panels over the\r\narch commemorate King Edward the Third and his six sons. The Master’s\r\nlodge is seen in the distance through the gateway.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mastership.]\r\n\r\nThe Mastership of Trinity has been, ever since the Reformation, one of\r\nthe most important offices in the university; but it is rendered still\r\nmore distinguished by the great men who have successively filled it. The\r\nlast Master of King’s Hall became the first Master of Trinity and has\r\nhad among his successors Isaac Barrow, William Bill, Whitgift, Wilkins,\r\nBentley, and Whewell. Its chief benefactor Nevile was eighth Master.\r\n\r\nTrinity has been equally great in literature and science, and has\r\neffected more for both in the three hundred and fifty years of its\r\nexistence than any other centre of learning. Among its fellows it counts\r\nNewton, Adam Sedgwick, Ray, Barrow, Porson, Roger Cotes, Macaulay,\r\nWhewell, Westcott, Airy, Clerk Maxwell, Cayley, Hort, Thirlwall, Jebb.\r\nAmong lawyers Bacon, Coke, and Lyndhurst; among prelates Tunstall,[233]\r\nWhitgift, Lightfoot. Among other famous _alumni_ are Robert Devereux,\r\nCotton, Spelman, Thackeray, Granville (_M.A._ 1679), Peacock, Kinglake,\r\nTrench, De Morgan, F. D. Maurice, and the late Duke of Rutland (Lord\r\nJohn Manners). Among poets, Byron, Dryden, Andrew Marvell, Tennyson,\r\nDonne, Cowley, George Herbert, Monckton-Milnes. Another historic\r\nfriendship like that between Spenser and Kirke at Pembroke, Milton and\r\nKing at Christ’s, and Gray and Walpole, grew up in the shadow of\r\nTrinity--the friendship of Tennyson and Arthur Hallam commemorated in\r\n_In Memoriam_.\r\n\r\nThere are 60 fellowships, 74 scholarships worth each £100 a year, and 16\r\nsizarships of the value of £80 each. The students of Trinity number\r\none-fourth of the undergraduate population. The college is not only the\r\nlargest but the most important scholastic institution in the world:\r\n“being at this day” writes Fuller, “the stateliest and most uniform\r\ncollege in Christendom, out of which may be carved three Dutch\r\nuniversities.” Among the college livings are the university church of S.\r\nMary’s, S. Michael’s (the old church attached to Michaelhouse)\r\nChesterton Vicarage and several rectories and vicarages in the dioceses\r\nof Ely, York, Lincoln, Lichfield, London, Peterborough, and Carlisle,\r\nwhich include most of those belonging to King’s Hall and Michaelhouse,\r\nwith the exception of the Norwich benefices.[234]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gateways.]\r\n\r\nThe gateway of Trinity with its four towers, the two interior being the\r\nlarger and furnished with staircases, reminds us that the ornamental\r\ngateway was the last architectural addition to the college quadrangle.\r\nThe first ornamental archway was the great gate built for King’s Hall in\r\n1426.[235] It was copied in the turreted gateway of Queens’ College, and\r\nafterwards in the old gateway of King’s,[236] and in the present\r\ngateways of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT COURT, TRINITY COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThe largest at either University or in Europe. We see the Great Gate in\r\nthe picture on the right, facing us--the Chapel. To the left of the\r\nChapel is seen King Edward’s Gate, fourteenth century. The beautiful\r\nFountain in the middle of the picture is in the Renaissance style, and\r\nwas built by Nevile in 1602, and rebuilt in 1716.]\r\n\r\nChrist’s and S. John’s, and even in that second gateway of King’s Hall\r\nwhich is the present entrance gate of Trinity.[237] The only gateway in\r\nCambridge which varies completely from these models is Alcock’s at\r\nJesus, which is much lighter in character. The xvi century gateways of\r\nCaius are “the first specimens of the revival of stone work.”[238] The\r\nornamental gateway is a distinctive feature of Cambridge college\r\narchitecture. The room over the gate was used as a muniment room; in S.\r\nJohn’s the chamber in the tower serves this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Caius College A.D. 1557.]\r\n\r\nIn 1557 Doctor John Keys (whose name was Latinised as Caius) built and\r\nincorporated with Gonville Hall a college for scientific research and\r\nmedical studies--the illustrious society which has since been known as\r\nGonville and Caius College.\r\n\r\nKeys or Caius was one of the great physicians of the xvi century;\r\nphysician to Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth, and President of the\r\nCollege of Physicians. He was a Yorkshireman by race but a native of\r\nNorwich, and had been Principal of Physwick hostel which was at that\r\ntime attached to Gonville Hall. Italian universities had turned his mind\r\nfrom the study of divinity to that of medicine and he became a doctor in\r\nthat faculty at Padua in 1541, two years after leaving Cambridge. At\r\nPadua he lived with one of the earliest anatomists--Vesalius; and he\r\nhimself lectured for twenty years on anatomy to the surgeons in London,\r\nat the request of Henry VIII.[239] He was Master of the college of which\r\nhe was co-founder, but regularly spent the emoluments on fresh buildings\r\nat Caius. He was not only a great naturalist, the first English\r\nanatomist, a great physician, and an eminent classic,[240] but also a\r\ndistinguished antiquary, and to him we owe one of the most valuable\r\nhistories of the university. He had withal “a perverse stomach to the\r\nprofessors of the gospel,” and clung like Metcalfe of S. John’s and\r\nBaker of King’s to the old religion and the old ways of worship.[241] He\r\nis buried in the college chapel, and the simple words _Fui Caius_ are\r\ninscribed over him. The foundation-stone of Caius he had himself\r\ninscribed: _Johannes Caius posuit sapientiae_; “John Caius dedicated it\r\nto knowledge.”\r\n\r\nHe built his college in two parallel ranges, east and west; a chapel and\r\nthe Master’s lodge occupying the north side. On the south was a low wall\r\nwith a gateway. “We decree,” he writes in the statutes of Caius, “that\r\nno building be constructed which shall shut in the entire south side of\r\nthe college of our foundation, lest for lack of free ventilation the air\r\nshould become foul.” This appreciation of the all-importance of air and\r\nsun to living organisms was more than three hundred years in advance of\r\nhis time. If his instructions be not carried out, he says, the health of\r\nthe college will be impaired, and disease and death will ensue. Closed\r\nquadrangles had been built in Cambridge ever\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HALL OF TRINITY COLLEGE FROM NEVILE’S COURT\r\n\r\nThis is sometimes called the Cloister Court, and was built at the\r\nexpense of Dr. Nevile about 1612.

Lord Byron occupied rooms in Nevile’s Court.]\r\n\r\nsince the erection of Pembroke College, but no more were built there\r\nafter the time of Caius.[242] Andrew Perne of Peterhouse was a\r\ncontemporary stickler for hygienic conditions in the colleges; he saw to\r\nit that only pure water should be available “for the avoiding of the\r\nannoyance, infection, and contagion ordinarily arising through the\r\nuncleanness” of King’s Ditch “to the great endammaging” of health and\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nThe college founded by Gonville is still known as Gonville Court in the\r\njoint college; but the other buildings are entirely new and make a\r\nmodern show at the corner of King’s Parade not necessarily justified by\r\nthe modernness of the science pursued within their walls.\r\n\r\nIn the xv century Gonville was peopled with monastic students: it is\r\nsaid that when Humphrey de la Pole and Gresham were studying there the\r\nother scholars were nearly all religious. If the monks of Ely, Crowland,\r\nRamsey, and Walden lived at Monks’ hostel, the monks of Norwich priory\r\nhad been allowed by a special papal exemption to continue to frequent\r\nGonville and Trinity Halls, as they had done since Bateman’s time.[243]\r\nThe Suffolk monks of Butley, black Benedictines from Bury, Cistercians\r\nfrom Lewes, and Austin canons from Westacre in Norfolk were also to be\r\nfound there.[244] Gonville Hall was always regarded as the papal\r\nfavourite at Cambridge; yet by 1530 Nix Bishop of Norwich in a letter to\r\nthe primate Warham asserts that not one of the clerks at Gonville but\r\n“savoured of the frying pan.”\r\n\r\nCaius has always been a doctors’ college; Harvey, Glisson the anatomist,\r\nand a long roll of eminent surgeons and physicians here received their\r\neducation. Jeremy Taylor and Sir Thomas Gresham the only one of the\r\nMerchant Adventurers known to have been at a university, and founder of\r\nthe Royal Exchange, were also sons of this house; as was Samuel Clarke\r\n(_b._ Norwich 1675) the metaphysician, “the lad of Caius.”\r\n\r\nThere are 22 fellows and some 36 scholars and exhibitioners, the value\r\nvarying from £100 down to £20. There are also two chapel-clerkships (£38\r\nfor one year), and the Tancred medical studentships each worth £100 a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emmanuel 1584.]\r\n\r\nWe now come to the last two colleges to be founded in the xvi century.\r\nEmmanuel was founded by Sir Walter Mildmay, Chancellor of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEVILE’S GATE, TRINITY COLLEGE\r\n\r\nTo the left are the College kitchens and on the right is Bishop’s\r\nHostel.

The site he chose was the suppressed\r\nhouse of the Dominicans, and Ralph Symons, the architect who worked with\r\nso much skill and judgment at S. John’s and under Nevile at Trinity,\r\nconverted the friary buildings into the Puritan college. The friars’\r\nchurch is now the college hall and the library which at one time served\r\nas a chapel was it is said the convent refectory. The college chapel was\r\nbuilt, from Wren’s designs, by Sancroft Archbishop of Canterbury\r\n(1668-78); and the college itself was rebuilt in the xviii and xix\r\ncenturies. Emmanuel has preserved an evangelical character, the relic of\r\nits original Calvinism in doctrine and Puritanism in discipline; and the\r\nclerical students of Ridley Hall are recruited chiefly from here. “In\r\nEmmanuel College they do follow a private course of public prayer, after\r\ntheir own fashion”; the chapel used was unconsecrated, the communion was\r\nreceived sitting. The contrast must have been all the greater at this\r\ntime--the beginning of the xvii century--when incense was burning and\r\nLatin was sung in other Cambridge chapels.\r\n\r\nThe name of Emmanuel College recalls the movement with which it was\r\nconnected later in that century: when Whichcote, Cudworth, Smith, and\r\nCulverwell of Emmanuel, and More of Christ’s led the van of philosophic\r\nthought.[245] Besides Cudworth, Emmanuel has nurtured at least four\r\neminent representatives of learning and science, Flamsteed, Wallis,\r\nFoster, Horrox; and one great statesman, Sir William Temple; and as a\r\nrepresentative churchman, Sancroft who was also Master of the college.\r\nSamuel Parr was here; and William Law, the author of the “Serious Call,”\r\nwas a nonjuring fellow. Harvard went from Emmanuel to America where he\r\nfounded the university which bears his name.\r\n\r\nThere are 16 fellowships, 30 scholarships, and 4 sizarships.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sidney Sussex 1594.]\r\n\r\nSidney Sussex, the last of the xvi century colleges, was also built in\r\nElizabeth’s reign, on the site of the Greyfriars’ as Emmanuel rose on\r\nthe site of the Blackfriars’ house. Frances Sidney, daughter of Sir\r\nWilliam Sidney and wife to the third Earl of Sussex, bequeathed the\r\nmoney for the foundation, and her executors purchased the property from\r\nTrinity College. The ubiquitous Ralph Symons was the architect; but the\r\ncollege was modernised in the early xix century. There are two courts:\r\nthe hall and lodge in one, the chapel and library in the other. In this\r\nlast is a x century pontifical from a northern diocese, probably Durham.\r\nThe character of the college has always remained Protestant, this and\r\nEmmanuel being the first Protestant foundations in the university.\r\nOliver Cromwell was enrolled a member the day of Shakespeare’s death,\r\nand Fuller the ecclesiastical historian was here for many years.

Edward Montague, Earl of\r\nManchester, of whom the historian writes that he “loved his country with\r\ntoo unskilful a tenderness” was a member of this college, and carried\r\nout Cromwell’s destructive programme at his university. No one mentions\r\nthe founder of Sidney Sussex without saying that she was aunt to Sir\r\nPhilip, and it is a title of honour even for the founder of a college:\r\ndid not Fulke Greville have himself described in his epitaph as “Frend\r\nto Sir Philip Sidney”?\r\n\r\nThere are 10 fellows and 36 scholars on the foundation, besides\r\nsizarships of the value of £27 a year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Downing 1803.]\r\n\r\nOne college has been built at Cambridge in modern times. The founder,\r\nwho bequeathed his property for the purpose, was Sir George Downing of\r\nGamlingay Park, Cambridgeshire, whose father was a graduate of Clare.\r\nWilkins (the architect of the modern portions of King’s and Corpus and\r\nof the New Court of Trinity) began the structure in 1807, but he only\r\ncompleted the west and east sides. The town has since grown up to the\r\ncollege, which has large pleasure grounds. A “Downing” professorship of\r\nlaw and another of medicine were also endowed by the founder. Six of the\r\n8 college fellowships must be held by students of law or medicine; and\r\nthere are 10 scholars on the foundation.\r\n\r\nTaking the place of the older hostels, but inversely as regards their\r\nrelative proportion to the colleges, there are now 6 hostels, colleges\r\nin all but university status, with resident students reading for the\r\nusual university examinations. There are also two post-graduate hostels.\r\nThe oldest of these are _Newnham_ (1871) and _Girton_ (1873) which are\r\ndescribed in another chapter. _Cavendish College_ on the Hills Road was\r\nopened in 1876 by the County College Association and admitted students\r\nfrom sixteen years old. It was recognised as a public hostel (November\r\n9, 1882) but was closed nine years later.\r\n\r\n_Ridley Hall_ was erected in 1880 for theological students who have\r\ntaken their degree. Its object is the maintenance of Reformation\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n_Selwyn College_ was founded in 1882, by subscription, in memory of\r\nBishop Selwyn, and for the maintenance of Church of England principles,\r\nto whose members it is restricted. This institution occupies a somewhat\r\nanomalous position in the university, for it is the only hostel on\r\navowedly “denominational” lines publicly recognised by and therefore\r\nforming part of the academic society. Cambridge has set its face against\r\nthe recognition of colleges intended to meet the interests of one\r\nreligious section of the community to the exclusion of others, on the\r\nground that members of all religious communities may now receive\r\ninstruction in any of the colleges, and suffer no interference with\r\ntheir religion, and also in pursuance of the main principle that a\r\nuniversity education is of greater use\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAIUS COLLEGE AND THE SENATE HOUSE FROM ST.

Edmund_\r\napplied for recognition in 1898, the “grace” was refused, in spite of\r\nthe fact that many members of the university unconnected with any\r\nreligious denomination, voted in its favour. _S. Edmund’s House_ was\r\nfounded by the Duke of Norfolk in 1897, and is for clerical students\r\nworking for a tripos or other advanced work recognised in the\r\nuniversity. It ranks as a licensed lodging house. A Benedictine hostel,\r\n_Benet House_, was founded in the same year, and supported by the father\r\nof the present abbot of Downside. A few professed monks, who are entered\r\nas members of Christ’s or some other college, pursue there the usual\r\nuniversity course.\r\n\r\n_Westminster College_ is a post-graduate college for the Presbyterian\r\nChurch of England, founded in Cambridge in 1899 (removed from London).\r\n\r\n_Cheshunt_ theological _College_, founded by the Countess of Huntingdon\r\nin 1768, has just been removed to Cambridge, and is there lodged in\r\ntemporary premises. Undergraduate and post-graduate students are\r\nreceived, the former being non-collegiate members of the university.\r\nStudents and staff must be of the Evangelical Reformed faith, but are\r\nfree to enter the ministry of the established or any Free Church\r\nresponding to that description.\r\n\r\nThese four last are the result of the abolition of the test act (1871)\r\nwhich kept our universities closed both to catholics and nonconformists:\r\nbut Benet and S. Edmund’s houses were projected when the prohibition to\r\ncatholics, maintained by Cardinal Manning, was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A note on the nationality of Cambridge founders.]\r\n\r\n     Hugh de Balsham, founder of Peterhouse, 1284, Cambridge.

Two of the founders of colleges\r\nwere French. Both Welsh and Irish names have been from the first\r\nrepresented, but Cambridge owes nothing to Scotland.[251] Even as late\r\nas 1535 when Henry issued the royal injunctions to the university during\r\nthe chancellorship of Cromwell, there were students from every diocese\r\nand district of England, and from Wales and Ireland, at Cambridge, but\r\nScotland is not mentioned.[252] Of the 4 countesses who founded\r\ncolleges, one was twice married to Irishmen, and two married Welshmen.\r\n\r\nOf the 14 (non-royal) men founders (including the third Duke of\r\nBuckingham and Fisher) 5 were East Anglian (3 Cambridgeshire), 3 were\r\nEast-Saxons, 3 Yorkshiremen, one a Northamptonshire man, and one came\r\nfrom Staffordshire. To Beverley the university owes Fisher and Alcock,\r\nto Chelmsford Badew and Mildmay, to Norwich Bateman and Caius.\r\n\r\nOf the 6 women founders, two were French (Chatillon and Queen Margaret)\r\none was of French extraction (Sidney), the Clares were Normans,\r\nElizabeth Clare and Chatillon were Plantagenets through Henry III. and\r\nEdward, Margaret Beaufort and Buckingham by descent from Edward III.;\r\nElizabeth Woodville was half French through her mother Jaquetta of\r\nLuxembourg, daughter of Peter Comte de Saint-Paul. Thus, curiously\r\nenough, two of the women founders hailed from Anjou (Margaret and\r\nFrances Sidney) and two from Saint-Paul (Chatillon and Elizabeth\r\nWoodville).\r\n\r\nThe colleges they founded favoured different provinces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scope of their foundations.]\r\n\r\n     Marie Valence, wished French fellows to be preferred to others of\r\n     equal merits, and, failing these, scholars from the college\r\n     rectories.[253]\r\n\r\n     Gonville wished to benefit East Anglian clergy.\r\n\r\n     Bateman wished chiefly to benefit clergy of the diocese of Norwich.\r\n\r\n     Henry VI. decided that failing scholars from the parishes of Eton\r\n     or King’s, Buckinghamshire and Cambridgeshire should have the\r\n     preference.\r\n\r\n     Margaret of Anjou’s college was, by Andrew Doket, allied with the\r\n     Cambridge Greyfriars.\r\n\r\n     Margaret Beaufort and Fisher favoured the northern districts of\r\n     Richmond, Derby, Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, York,\r\n     Lancashire, and Nottingham, from which half at least of the\r\n     scholars were to come.\r\n\r\n     Sidney Sussex College was, by its “bye-founder” Sir Francis Clerk,\r\n     endowed for students from Bedfordshire.\r\n\r\n     Hervey de Stanton founded Michaelhouse for clergy, and for the\r\n     study of theology.\r\n\r\nThe special character given to Peterhouse by Balsham was the studious\r\npursuit of letters, arts, Aristotle, canon law or theology. There were\r\nto be 2 scholars for civil and canon law, and one for medicine; and poor\r\nbible-clerks were to be instructed in grammar.\r\n\r\n     Marie Valence founded Pembroke for the study of arts as well as\r\n     theology.\r\n\r\n     Elizabeth de Burgh founded Clare for general learning. Three poor\r\n     boys were to be instructed in grammar, logic, and singing.\r\n\r\n     Edmund Gonville made the 7 Arts the foundation for a theological\r\n     training. (Bateman abolished its theological character.)\r\n\r\n     William Bateman founded Trinity Hall for the study of law only.\r\n\r\n     The two Guilds of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin founded\r\n     their college for scholars in sacred orders, and for the study of\r\n     theology and canon law.\r\n\r\n     William Byngham established God’s House for the study of grammar\r\n     among the clergy of the north-eastern counties.\r\n\r\n     Henry VI. required all the scholars of King’s to be candidates for\r\n     sacred orders, and made theology and arts the principal but not the\r\n     exclusive faculties.\r\n\r\n     Margaret of Anjou made theology the principal study at Queens’, and\r\n     in her college law was only tolerated. The master of arts must\r\n     either teach the _trivium_ and _quadrivium_ for 3 years, or devote\r\n     the same time to the liberal sciences or Aristotle.\r\n\r\n     Robert Woodlark made his fellows restrict their studies by vow to\r\n     “philosophy and sacred theology”--his college of S. Catherine was\r\n     founded to promote Church interests exclusively.\r\n\r\n     John Alcock required that the scholars of Jesus College when they\r\n     had graduated in arts, should devote themselves to the study of\r\n     theology. Canon law was prohibited, but one out of the 12 fellows\r\n     might be a student of civil law.\r\n\r\n     Margaret Beaufort founded Christ’s for the study of grammar, arts,\r\n     and theology, but law and medicine were excluded.\r\n\r\n     Edward III. and Henry VIII. founded King’s Hall and Trinity College\r\n     for general learning.\r\n\r\n     John Caius founded his college for the pursuit of science.\r\n\r\n     Sir Walter Mildmay founded Emmanuel for clergy who should maintain\r\n     the principles of the Reformation.\r\n\r\n     Sir George Downing founded his college for the study of law and\r\n     medicine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GATE OF HONOUR, CAIUS COLLEGE\r\n\r\nIn the background on the right appear the buildings of the University\r\nLibrary, one of the Turrets of King’s Chapel in the distance, and the\r\nSenate House is seen on the left.]\r\n\r\nHence Michaelhouse, Gonville, Corpus, God’s House, King’s, Catherine’s,\r\nJesus, and Emmanuel were destined for a clerical curriculum only.\r\n\r\nBateman contemplated the union of the diplomatic career with the\r\nclerical; and although there were many jurists’ hostels his is the only\r\ncollege founded and endowed for the exclusive study of law. Caius is the\r\nonly college founded and endowed for the natural sciences and medicine;\r\nbut in the xiii century Balsham, in the xvith Caius, and in the xixth\r\nDowning, all provided for medical studies. Similarly in the xiii, xiv,\r\nand xvi centuries Balsham, Edward III., Elizabeth de Burgh and Henry\r\nVIII. each founded a college for the pursuit of general knowledge.[254]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wealth of the university.\r\n\r\nSources of revenue.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the xiiith, xivth, and xvth centuries the university was\r\ncertainly a very poor corporation. It took a hundred years to build\r\nthree sides of the Schools quadrangle, and the money for the important\r\nschools of Philosophy and Civil Law collected by Chancellor Booth in the\r\nxv century was only got together by taxing the university.\r\n\r\nThe university as distinguished from the colleges has never been a\r\nwealthy society, and its sources of revenue are now much the same as\r\nthey have always been. There are the capitation fees of members of the\r\nuniversity. Fees for matriculation, for the public examinations, and for\r\ngraduation, and proctors’ fines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST COURT OF EMMANUEL COLLEGE]\r\n\r\nThe income of Burwell rectory and of a farm at Barton, The trading\r\nprofits of the University Press; and one new source of income--the\r\nannual contribution from each of the colleges, in proportion to its\r\nrevenues, provided for by statute in 1882. The vice-chancellor delivers\r\nan annual statement of expenditure, which includes the upkeep of the\r\nSenate House and Schools, of the University church, the Registrary’s\r\noffice, the observatory, museums and lecture rooms, and a yearly\r\ncontribution to the library: the salaries of professors and public\r\nexaminers, and the stipends and salaries of university officers and\r\nservants.[255]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: College wealth and property.]\r\n\r\nThe original property of colleges was in land, benefices, and plate. The\r\nportable property was laid by in a _chest_ kept in the muniment room:\r\nhere title deeds, charters, rare books, college plate, and legacies _in\r\nspecie_ were treasured; the last being drawn upon for the purpose for\r\nwhich they were bequeathed until exhausted. Benefactors to a college\r\npresented it with a “chest,” and hence the “University Chest” is still\r\nthe name for its revenue. Queen Eleanor presented a “chest” of a hundred\r\nmarks to the university in 1293 (“The Queen’s Chest”); and Elizabeth,\r\nDuchess of Norfolk, enriched the public treasury with a thousand marks\r\nin the reign of Henry VII. when the “chests” had been “embezzled to\r\nprivate men’s profit”; a gift “which put the university in stock\r\nagain.”[256] The “Ely Chest” was given in 1320 by John sometime Prior of\r\nEly and Bishop of Norwich, and the other principal givers were country\r\nparsons, university chancellors, a “citizen of London” in 1344, and\r\nThomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter (“Exeter’s Chest”) in 1401.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the colleges differs greatly. Trinity college has a gross\r\nincome of over £74,000 and the next richest college is S. John’s. The\r\npoorer colleges have gross incomes varying from 4 to £9000.[257] The\r\nproportion contributed at Cambridge and Oxford for the royal loan of\r\n1522 is interesting. At Oxford, New College and Magdalen contributed\r\nmost, more than eight times as much as Exeter and Queens’ (£40) which\r\ngave least.[258] At Cambridge, King’s College and King’s Hall were the\r\nrichest corporations and contributed the same sums as New College and\r\nMagdalen Oxford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD COURT IN EMMANUEL COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThe large stained-glass window of the Hall is seen on the right, and\r\nbeyond that the window of the Combination Room.

This certificate of\r\nproficiency referred to the “three faculties” of theology, law, and\r\nmedicine, to which was added later “the liberal arts.” The titles of\r\n“master,” “doctor,” and “professor” were at first synonymous. A master\r\nwas a doctor in his subject, capable of professing it. The title of\r\n“master,” however, clung to the faculty of arts, that of “doctor” to the\r\nthree liberal or learned professions.\r\n\r\nThe following degrees are now conferred: in arts, the bachelor and\r\nmaster (_B.A._, _M.A._); in divinity, the bachelor and doctor (_B.D._,\r\n_D.D._--formerly _S.T.P._, _sacrae theologiae professor_); in laws,\r\nbachelor, master and doctor (_LL.B._, _LL.M._, _LL.D._[259]); in\r\nmedicine, bachelor and doctor (_M.B._, _M.D._); in music, bachelor,\r\nmaster, and doctor (_Mus.B._, _Mus.M._, _Mus.D._); in surgery, bachelor\r\nand master (_B.C._, _M.C._). Besides which a doctorate in science\r\n(_Sc.D._), and a doctorate in letters (_Litt.D._), are conferred on\r\ngraduates in laws or in either of the last four faculties who have made\r\nsome original contribution to the advancement of science or\r\nlearning.[260]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAKE AND NEW BUILDINGS, EMMANUEL COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThe building is known as the Hostel, and was erected between 1885 and\r\n1894.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bachelor and exercises of the schools.]\r\n\r\nThe title of bachelor originally marked the conclusion of a period of\r\nstudy; it was not a degree, and bestowed no faculty to teach. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, a bachelor was an apprentice or aspirant to another status or\r\nposition; and he remained _in statu pupillari_ as he still is in theory\r\nto-day.[261]\r\n\r\nIt is only in modern times that the conferring of a degree follows upon\r\na set written examination. For six hundred years the aspiring bachelor\r\nand master obtained their status by public disputations in the schools.\r\nPublic exercises, called “acts, opponencies and responsions,” were\r\nregularly held during the period of probation, and the student advanced\r\nto the degree of master by steps which recall the rites of initiation in\r\nthe catechumenate. After his first year the “freshman” became a “junior\r\nsophister”[262] in one of the faculties, and began to attend the school\r\ndisputations, without however taking part in them. In his fourth year,\r\nas senior sophister, he qualified to be “questionist,” and presented\r\nhimself as such at the beginning of Lent with ceremonies which turned\r\nhim into a bachelor; ceremonies in which the Cambridge bedell figures\r\nas a veritable deacon. The procession was formed on Ash Wednesday and\r\nintroduced into the arts schools by the bedell, who exclaimed: “_Nostra\r\nMater, bona nova, bona nova!_” and “the father” (the presiding college\r\nsenior) having proceeded to his place, the bedell suggested to him the\r\nstages of the ceremony: _Reverende pater, licebit tibi incipere_, etc.\r\nAfter this day the new bachelor was no longer a questionist but a\r\n“determiner” who determined in place of responding to the propositions\r\nraised in the schools. This status continued through Lent, and hence the\r\nincepting bachelor was described as _stans in quadragesima_.[263]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The master of arts.]\r\n\r\nIn due course the bachelor “commenced master of arts,” the inception\r\ntaking place in Great S. Mary’s church on the day of the “Great\r\nCommencement” the second of July. This is the traditional time of year\r\nfor the granting of degrees, and the ceremony is still called\r\n“Commencements” in Cambridge and in universities which, like Dublin, are\r\nderivative institutions. The status now attained was that of _regent\r\nmaster_, _i.e._ a junior graduate whose\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLOISTER COURT, SIDNEY SUSSEX COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThe new buildings on the left of the picture were designed by Mr. J. L.\r\nPearson and erected in 1890. In the distance we see the large mullioned\r\nwindow of the Hall, which is part of the old college building begun\r\n1596.]\r\n\r\nbusiness it was to teach the subjects he had himself been taught, for a\r\nperiod of five years; after which he became a non-regent, or full\r\nmaster.[264] The obligation to teach was part of the university theory\r\nof studies; so that when a Cambridge professor of our own time\r\nastonished his hearers by declaring “I know nothing of political\r\neconomy, I have not even taught it” he was speaking in the spirit of the\r\nuniversity maxim _disce docendo_. It was the scholar who had taught who\r\nwas called _magister_ and _doctor_ in old times, not the men who, as is\r\nthe case nowadays, “go down” with no other qualification than that of\r\nthe bachelor and are nevertheless allowed in due time to write _M.A._\r\nafter their names. For the _degree_ of _M.A._ has virtually ceased to\r\nexist: no one now “commences master,” and the master of arts is simply\r\nthe bachelor who has spent three years away from the university, in\r\nwhich he has had time to forget what he once knew. Indeed as between the\r\nmaster and the bachelor the case is often inverted, and if the former is\r\nan ordinary degree man and the latter an honours man, it is the latter\r\nwho is the master in his subject while the former is little else than a\r\ntyro. That the degree of master carries with it not one iota more of\r\nscholarship or experience is certainly not understood by the public, but\r\nthe fact that it is understood elsewhere supplies the reason why such a\r\nsmall proportion of men now proceed to take it.[265]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Written examinations.]\r\n\r\nIt was not till the xviii century that written examinations were\r\nintroduced, and from the day of their introduction the practice grew and\r\nflourished. Originally teaching and tests had both been oral, it was\r\nonly as books became cheaper that the book in a measure supplanted the\r\nteacher, the written examination came to supplant the public acts and\r\ndisputations, and _the writing down of knowledge_ became the\r\ncharacteristic feature of Cambridge training. “Then know, sir, that at\r\nthis place, all things--prizes, scholarships, and fellowships--are\r\nbestowed not on the greatest readers, but on those who, without any\r\nassistance, can produce most knowledge upon paper.” “Read six or eight\r\nhours a day, and _write down what you know_,” is a tutor’s advice ninety\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The tripos.]\r\n\r\nThe _tripos_, although it did not take shape till the middle of the same\r\ncentury derives its name from a custom of the xvith. On the day when the\r\nbachelor obtained his public recognition he had as his opponent in\r\ndiscussion one of the older bachelors who posed as the champion of the\r\nuniversity. He sat upon a three-legged stool “before Mr. Proctor’s seat”\r\nand\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOWNING COLLEGE FROM THE ENTRANCE IN REGENT STREET\r\n\r\nThese buildings are in the classical style and are all\r\nnineteenth-century work.]\r\n\r\ndisputed with the senior questionist. This stool or _tripod_ was\r\neventually to provide a name for the great written examination of\r\nsucceeding centuries--the _tripos_. The champion bachelor was addressed\r\nas “Mr. Tripos,” and his humorous orations were called “tripos\r\nspeeches.” _Tripos verses_ were next written, and on the back of these\r\nthe moderators, in the middle of the xviii century, began printing the\r\nhonours list:[266] from this _tripos list of names_ the transition was\r\neasy to _tripos_ as the name of the examination itself--the tripos\r\nexamination. These disputations degenerated in Restoration times to\r\nbuffoonery, but the principle of examination made steady progress,[267]\r\nand there were probably no tripos speeches after the Senate House was\r\nbuilt. In the xvi and xvii centuries, however, great personages had acts\r\nand disputations performed for their entertainment; and the tastes of\r\nElizabeth and her Scotch successor were consulted when “a physic act”\r\nwas kept before the former, while “a philosophy act” was reserved for\r\nJames.\r\n\r\nThere were declamations, which did not escape Byron’s ridicule, in the\r\nxix century, but the last general public “act” was kept in 1839. The\r\n_viva voce_ examination in the “Little go” which was only discontinued\r\n14 years ago, and the _viva voce_ and the “act” for the medical\r\ndegree[268] are the only survivals to our day of that oral examination\r\nby which the scholar in the public acts constantly responded to the\r\nliving voice of the _magister_. For the first time in their long history\r\nsilence settled down upon the schools, and the eye replaced the ear as\r\nthe channel of knowledge.[269]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subjects of study. _Trivium_ and _Quadrivium_.]\r\n\r\nThe subjects in which university students were from the first exercised,\r\nwere those of the Roman _trivium_ and _quadrivium_, and the three\r\nfaculties of theology law and medicine. A special importance must be\r\nassigned to the school of grammar--the first member of the _trivium_--at\r\nCambridge. There is every reason to believe that it flourished there not\r\nonly in the xiii century, under the patronage of the bishops of Ely, but\r\nalso in the xiith. It was called the school of glomery (glomery,\r\nglamery, grammery)[270] and continued to be of importance till the xvi\r\ncentury, the last degree in grammar being granted in 1542.[271] Degrees\r\nin grammar were, nevertheless,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: xii-xiii c.]\r\n\r\nconsidered inferior to those in arts. To begin with, grammar was only\r\nstudied for three years, arts for seven; grammar made the clerk, arts\r\nthe professor. The introduction of the “new art,” Aristotle’s\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1712.]\r\n\r\nanalytical logic, increased the importance of the second member of the\r\n_trivium_: the name of Aristotle was a name to conjure with, but no new\r\ntexts came to light to add lustre to the acquirements of the classical\r\ngrammarian. As to the third member of the _trivium_, public rhetoric\r\nlectures were delivered in Cambridge by George Herbert (1620); but a\r\ncentury later Steele complains that both universities are “dumb in the\r\nstudy of eloquence.” There were still however rhetoric lectures in the\r\nxviii century, but they were not about rhetoric, and the public\r\ndeclamations in the senate house must be regarded as the last homage to\r\nthis most ancient of arts, whose modern successor is the Union debating\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The three liberal or learned faculties.]\r\n\r\nIf the original Cambridge schools were grammar schools after the pattern\r\nof Orléans and Bury-St.-Edmund’s, then the introduction of the arts\r\nfaculty--the trivium and quadrivium--was the first step towards the\r\nformation of a _universitas_; and its appearance in the xii century\r\nwould account for the university status of Cambridge in the opening\r\nyears of the xiii century.[272] The first of the three learned faculties\r\nto take its place in the university was divinity, and with the rise of\r\nthe earliest colleges provision was made for the study of the two\r\nfaculties of theology and law. The faculty of medicine was the last to\r\ngain a footing. Cambridge never became famous as a school of any of the\r\nfaculties in the sense in which Paris represented divinity, Bologna\r\nlaw, Montpellier medicine. The study of the civil and canon law was,\r\nhowever, prominent in the xv and early xvi centuries, but was shorn of\r\nits ecclesiastical moiety during the chancellorship of Thomas Cromwell\r\nwhen Peter Lombard and Gratian were banished the Cambridge schools.[273]\r\nOf the two universities Cambridge alone retains a recognition of canon\r\nlaw in the title of its bachelors masters and doctors of laws, _LL.B._,\r\n_LL.M._, and _LL.D._, a title commuted at Oxford into ‘bachelor and\r\ndoctor of civil law,’ _B.C.L._ and _D.C.L._ The medical progress of the\r\nearly xvi century which had been marked by the foundation in 1518 of the\r\nRoyal College of Physicians reached Cambridge by means of two great men,\r\nLinacre from Oxford and its own distinguished son John Caius. Peterhouse\r\nhad been the first college to admit medical studies, but our naturalists\r\nand physicians of later times, not content with the fare provided for\r\nthem in England, took their degrees at the continental schools.\r\nMedicine, the last to obtain recognition, is now the most prominent\r\nrepresentative of the learned faculties at Cambridge. Until 1874 when a\r\ntheological tripos was formed, admitting to a degree in that subject\r\nonly, theology was studied as part of the mathematical tripos. Law was\r\ntaken as an additional subject, and degrees in divinity and law were\r\nproceeded to separately, as now. Satisfying the examiners in the\r\ntheological, law, or natural sciences tripos does not admit the student\r\nto any but the arts degree. Medical students need not, however, graduate\r\nin arts, but may proceed at once, after taking the Previous Examination,\r\nto read for the _M.B._ degree.[274] In addition they must keep an “act,”\r\nwhich consists in reading a thesis previously approved by the Regius\r\nProfessor of Physic. Having read the thesis (of which public notice is\r\ngiven) in the schools, the candidate is orally examined by the presiding\r\nRegius Professor of Physic. After this he becomes an _M.B._[275]\r\n\r\nA candidate who has obtained honours in Parts I. and II. of the law\r\ntripos or honours in Part I. in addition to an arts degree, is eligible\r\nfor the degree in laws and may proceed to take the _LL.B._, the _B.A._,\r\nor both. Any candidate may “incept in law” (_LL.M._), without further\r\nexamination, who has taken a first class in both parts of the law\r\ntripos. If he has not this qualification he must have attained an\r\nhonours standard in one part of the tripos, or be a qualified barrister\r\nor solicitor, or their equivalent in Scotland. In this case he must\r\nsubmit a dissertation on law, its history, or philosophy. The doctorate\r\nof laws is obtained after making an application in writing and sending\r\nin an original written contribution to the science of law. The _LL.M._\r\ncannot incept till six years have elapsed from the end of his first term\r\nof residence, and five years must elapse between the master’s and the\r\ndoctor’s degree.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The doctorate.]\r\n\r\nA master of arts or of laws becomes a bachelor of divinity after\r\nsubscribing certain declarations required by statute and preaching a\r\nsermon in the University church. Four years later he must “keep an act”\r\n_or_ print a dissertation, in Latin or English, upon some matter of\r\nbiblical exegesis or history, of dogmatic theology, ecclesiastical\r\nhistory or antiquities, or on the evidences of Christianity. The “act”\r\nis kept in the same way as that for the medical degree, and includes a\r\n_viva voce_ examination. To proceed to the _D.D._ the same preliminary\r\nformalities as for the _B.D._ must be observed,[276] and a dissertation\r\nbe printed on one of the same subjects. Five years must elapse between\r\nthe two degrees, except in the case of a _B.D._ who is also an _M.A._ of\r\nat least twelve years’ standing. In fact the lapse of time is all that\r\nremains of incepting and proceeding to the higher degrees.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Development of university studies.]\r\n\r\nUntil hard upon the close of the xv century there was no development in\r\nuniversity studies. Erasmus in 1516 describes them as having consisted\r\nuntil thirty years previously in nothing but Alexander (the grammar\r\ntext-book at Cambridge) the “Little Logicals,” the old exercises from\r\nAristotle, the _quaestiones_ from Duns Scotus. The study of mathematics,\r\nthe new Aristotle, a knowledge of Greek, had all come within the last\r\nfew years.[277]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The development of the mathematical tripos.]\r\n\r\nGradually the study of these “arts” yielded to the mathematical tripos.\r\nThe subjects which had been intended to embrace a general education\r\ndropped out,[278] those which dealt with mathematics or mathematical\r\nphysics encroached more and more, till in 1747 the historic tripos with\r\nwhich the name of Cambridge is identified was fully established. The\r\nconviction of the paramountcy of mathematical reasoning had been\r\nemphasised at the university by the discoveries of Newton, and when its\r\nmathematical studies were consolidated in the xvii century under the\r\ninfluence of Newton’s tutor, Isaac Barrow, “philosophy” was understood\r\nto mean the mathematical sciences, and continued to mean this and this\r\nonly in English mouths till the threshold of our own times.[279] “By\r\nthe study of the great relations of form,” writes an old Trinity\r\nstudent from the other side of the Atlantic, the Cambridge man acquired\r\nthat “breadth of reasoning,” that power of generalisation, and\r\nperception of analogy “in forms and formulae apparently dissimilar,”\r\nwhich characterise the scientific mind. A study which bestows accuracy\r\nof scholarship, the perception of order and beauty, and “inventive power\r\nof the highest kind,” was that “in which for two hundred years all, and\r\nnow more than half of the Cambridge candidates for honours exercise\r\nthemselves.”[280]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wranglers.]\r\n\r\nEuclid and Newton filled the Cambridge horizon, and summed, as we have\r\nseen, all philosophy and all “arts.” Theology itself ceased to rival the\r\nmathematical disputations which became the business of the schools _par\r\nexcellence_, and which were of such importance that the name of\r\n_wranglers_ was exclusively applied to those most proficient in them,\r\nand “the senior wrangler” held the first position in the university. To\r\nattain this place it was necessary to have “fagged steadily every day”\r\nfor six or eight hours. The quality of a man’s work would tell for\r\nnothing in the final result if he had neglected, with this end set\r\nbefore him, to practise that mere mechanical “pace” which would serve\r\nhim in the great week.[281]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The classical tripos.]\r\n\r\nIn 1822 the classical tripos was added. The history of classical studies\r\nat Cambridge is of special interest. The introduction of Greek into this\r\ncountry was a movement due directly to our universities: students of\r\nOxford first learnt the language in Italy, but Cambridge as a university\r\nfirst gave it an academic welcome. The last echoes among Englishmen of\r\nthe most wonderful idiom the world has heard resounded in the school of\r\nYork, when John of Beverley, Wilfrid, and Bede could be described as\r\nGrecians, and where Alcuin taught Greek. More than seven centuries later\r\nthe efforts of Fisher chancellor of the university of Cambridge with the\r\nco-operation first of Erasmus and then of Croke, re-established Greek in\r\nan English seat of learning.[282]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRUMPINGTON STREET FROM PETERHOUSE\r\n\r\nPart of the new buildings of Pembroke College are seen on the right, and\r\nthe Tower of the Pitt Press, commonly called by undergraduates “The\r\nFreshers’ Church,” is seen in the distance. The entrance to Peterhouse\r\nis behind the tree on the left of the picture.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greek at the universities.]\r\n\r\nErasmus had given up his dream of studying Greek in an Italian\r\nuniversity and had settled down three years before the close of the\r\ncentury at Oxford on hearing that Grocyn was teaching there.[283] He had\r\nknown some Greek before he went to Oxford, and he knew but little when\r\nhe left, for its acquisition was still his great pre-occupation when he\r\naccepted Fisher’s invitation and went to Cambridge. The work of Grocyn\r\nand Linacre left no trace in their own university. When Colet introduced\r\nthe study of Greek into his new school, Oxford showed itself hostile;\r\nwhen the Greek of Erasmus and Croke had taken permanent hold in\r\nCambridge, the Oxford students rose up in arms against the Cambridge\r\n“Grecians,” and dubbing themselves “Trojans” sought street brawls with\r\nthe “Greeks.” Finally, Sir Thomas More himself wrote a protest to his\r\nold university, which, he wrote, was engaged in casting ridicule on\r\nthose who “are promoting all the interests of literature at your\r\nuniversity, and especially that of Greek.” “At Cambridge, which you were\r\nalways accustomed to outshine, even those who do not learn Greek are so\r\nmuch persuaded to its study in their university that they praiseworthily\r\ncontribute to maintain a salaried professor who may teach it to\r\nothers.”[284]\r\n\r\nColet took Greek into our public schools, in face of the hostility of\r\nhis university; it was the Cambridge Grecians settled by Wolsey at\r\nCardinal College who established it at both universities, and it was men\r\nlike Ascham, Sir Thomas Smith, and Cheke who introduced it as Cambridge\r\nlearning to the world outside. It has been well said that classics “kept\r\na firm hold on the Cambridge mind.” The mantle of Erasmus Croke and\r\nCheke fell upon Bentley and Porson who had no rivals among English\r\nclassics and critics, and the services rendered by Cambridge as a\r\nuniversity in this direction have been maintained by the present\r\ngeneration of scholars.[285]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colloquial Latin and Greek.]\r\n\r\nBy order of Thomas Cromwell “two daily public acts one of Greek the\r\nother of Latin” were to be held in all the colleges.[286] The\r\nCommonwealth Committee tried to revive the colloquial use of Latin and\r\nGreek in 1649, but the use of Latin in halls and walks ceased in this\r\ncentury, though it lingered in the college lectures, the declamations,\r\nand the “acts and opponencies.” It lingered also in the college chapels,\r\nbut the only relic now remaining is the Latin grace in hall. The study\r\nof the classics themselves declined at Cambridge during the reign of\r\nCharles II. and Gray laments, while Bentley was still living, that these\r\nstudies should have “fallen into great contempt.”[287]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The moral sciences tripos.]\r\n\r\nIt was the introduction of the classical tripos which gave a foothold\r\nfor mental and moral philosophy. Occupation with Greek metaphysics,\r\ncontact with the Greek mind, brought into relief the one-sidedness of\r\nthe mathematical mind. It also placed the two methods in sharp contrast.\r\nFor hitherto a fundamental antagonism between mathematical and\r\nmetaphysical method had been unsuspected. It was not till the dispute\r\nbetween Whewell and Hamilton that the idea was pressed home that there\r\nwere two philosophical methods, not one; that not only the reasoning\r\nwhich begs but the reasoning which questions the premiss has a right to\r\nbe heard; that there was a philosophy of formal proof and one of\r\nphilosophic doubt; that axiomatical reasoning lay on the one side, and\r\nthe enquiry into the validity of the reasoning process itself on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Psychology.]\r\n\r\nIt was indeed by way of psychology that this other philosophy gained a\r\nfoothold in the university. It was the contact with the scientific\r\ntemper of Cambridge of psychology and psycho-physics--the modern\r\nscience _par excellence_, the point of contact between the experimental\r\nmethod and mental philosophy, the fine flower of science since Darwin,\r\nits complement, its interpreter--which ensured the introduction of a\r\nmoral sciences tripos. This it was which won recognition for an organon\r\nother than the mathematical. Metaphysics captured Cambridge based upon\r\npsychology, and here the two have never been divorced.\r\n\r\nThe problem of education at Cambridge before 1851 had been entirely\r\nconcerned with the mutual relations of mathematics, physics, and\r\nclassics. The two historic triposes had between them ousted even Locke\r\nand Paley, the relegation of which to the ordinary degree work\r\nnullified, for all serious philosophic purposes, the “grace” of 1779\r\nwhich had devoted a fourth day to examination in “natural religion,\r\nmoral philosophy, and Locke.”[288] Whewell who had lectured in 1839 as\r\nprofessor of casuistry on moral philosophy, was chiefly instrumental\r\neleven years later in forming the new tripos. The college which took the\r\nleading part was S. John’s, where the Rev. J. B. Mayor was fellow and\r\nafterwards examiner; and the first man admitted to a fellowship for his\r\nattainments in this direction was a Johnian who came out senior moralist\r\nin 1863. When the tripos was framed, within twenty-five years of the\r\nfinal disappearance of all mental philosophy from the higher schools at\r\nCambridge, it included papers on logic and psychology, on metaphysics,\r\nethics, political philosophy and political economy. The political\r\nsubjects now form a tripos to themselves, the Economics tripos created\r\nin 1903. Hort was a candidate in the first examination (1851) and L. B.\r\nSeeley in the third: until 1861, when Whewell and Leslie Stephen were\r\namong the examiners, the tripos was taken in addition to one of the\r\nothers, and did not confer a degree.[289]\r\n\r\nThat vampire of the Cambridge schools, mathematics, had absorbed not\r\nonly philosophy and the arts but also the natural sciences. It had been\r\nhowever through one of the great metaphysicians, Robert Clarke, that\r\nNewton’s physics had taken their place in the Cambridge curriculum, and\r\nLocke and Newton were there side by side, and had entered there\r\ntogether. It seemed, then, a simple revival and continuance of these\r\ntraditions when the natural sciences tripos was formed in the same year\r\nas the moral sciences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Empirical science at Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nEmpirical science at Cambridge dates from Linacre and Caius. The Puritan\r\nmasters of the university discountenanced science, discouraged the\r\nuniversity’s higher mathematics, but were led by their liking for the\r\nopen bible greatly to favour the study of Greek. It is a remarkable fact\r\nthat the natural ally of the reform movement was “Greek” not natural\r\nscience.[290] Greek and “heresy” were equivalents; Caius, the ardent\r\nchampion of medicine and empirical science in Cambridge, was one of the\r\nlast to cling to the old “popishe trumpery.”[291] Just two hundred years\r\nbefore the publication of the “Origin of Species,” someone writes to Sir\r\nThomas Browne the author of _Religio Medici_, from Darwin’s college at\r\nCambridge, saying that there were then (1648) “so few helps” at the\r\nuniversity for the student of medicine and science. With the Restoration\r\nscientific interests were revived, London setting the fashion to the\r\nseats of learning. But even at the close of the xviii century--that dark\r\nage of the universities--there was a professor of anatomy and there were\r\nlectures on “human anatomy and physiology” at Cambridge.[292] A few\r\nyears later there was no physiology and the only physical study was\r\nastronomy.[293] Such\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEASHILL\r\n\r\nThe Chancel of St. Edward’s Church is seen behind the stalls in the\r\nroadway, and the Tower of Great St. Mary’s in the distance. On the right\r\nis the Old Bell Inn and the old town pump is in the foreground.]\r\n\r\nwas the state of affairs two or three decades before the creation, in\r\n1851, of a tripos which included physiology, comparative anatomy,\r\nchemistry, geology, botany, and mineralogy. The examination now\r\ncomprises papers in 8 subjects, and is divided into two parts:\r\nchemistry, physics, mineralogy, geology, botany, zoology and comparative\r\nanatomy, human anatomy, and physiology. In the second part the last\r\npaper is upon human anatomy and vertebrate comparative anatomy.\r\nCambridge owes its present prominent position as a teacher in the\r\nscientific world to the remarkable development of its scientific\r\nlaboratories and equipment. For the purposes of the natural sciences\r\ntripos it possesses some of the finest laboratories and museums in the\r\nkingdom. The great Cavendish laboratory was built in 1874, the chemical\r\nin 1887, the engineering in 1894-9, the new medical school in 1904 with\r\nthe museum of geology, while the same year saw the erection of the most\r\ncomplete botanical laboratory in England. Cambridge therefore which is\r\n“the most ancient scientific school in the country” is also among the\r\nbest equipped.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The study of modern languages.]\r\n\r\nWithin a century of the decay of Norman French in England, a knowledge\r\nof modern languages began to assume value. Throughout the Tudor epoch it\r\nwas those ecclesiastics and lawyers who were also linguists to whom the\r\ndiplomatic posts and the secretaryships of state were entrusted. Latin\r\ndid not cease to be the common official medium, but the growth of\r\nnational dialects gave to a knowledge of these the importance which\r\nthey must always possess for the diplomat and the trader. “Esperanto”\r\nwill not take its place until nothing is spoken anywhere but Esperanto.\r\n\r\nSome progress was made in these studies in both the universities in the\r\nxvi century:--“Petrarch and Boccace in every man’s mouth--the French and\r\nItalian highly regarded: the Latin and Greek but lightly,” writes\r\nGabriel Harvey to Spenser: but the xixth opened at Cambridge barren of\r\nanything linguistic, ancient or modern, eastern or western, except the\r\nuncouth Latin of the schools.[294] The first languages tripos was formed\r\nin 1878 for the Semitic languages; the Indian languages tripos (1879)\r\nnow forms part, with the Semitic tripos, of the Oriental languages\r\ntripos created in 1895. In 1886 the “medieval and modern languages”\r\ntripos came into being.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: List of the triposes.]\r\n\r\nThe complete list of Cambridge triposes with the date of their\r\nintroduction is as follows:--(1) Mathematical 1747.[295] (2) Classical\r\n1822. (3) Moral Sciences 1851. (4) Natural Sciences 1851. (5) Law\r\n1858.[296] (6) Theological 1874. (7) Historical 1875.[297] (8) Medieval\r\nand Modern Languages 1886. (9) Mechanical Sciences 1894. (10) Oriental\r\nLanguages 1895. (11) Economics 1903.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changing value of examination tests.]\r\n\r\nThe value of the tests to which degrees have been attached in the past\r\nhas varied considerably, and the same is true of the present. The _M.A._\r\ndegree in the xvi and following century was obtained with little or no\r\nexamination; the disputations, as we have seen, were often idle forms,\r\nbut the improvement in methods dates from 1680 when the proctors were\r\nreplaced by _moderators_ as overseers in the sophisters’ school. Fifty\r\nyears later the building of the Senate House opened the new era, and the\r\nnext twenty years (1730-50) saw rapid progress; so that the Cambridge\r\ndegree was still something better than the Oxford when at the end of\r\nthat century aspirants for degrees at both universities were adequately\r\ndescribed as “term-trotters.”[298] The conspicuous university learning\r\nof the xvii century was untested and unstimulated by any adequate\r\nexamination test; but earlier still the sheer number of years passed at\r\na university must have had a value which is now lost. Seven years was\r\nthe rule at Cambridge in the xv, xvi and xvii centuries, and the early\r\nhistory of the oldest of Cambridge colleges shows us the Peterhouse\r\nstudents residing _all the year round_.[299] Nowadays the standards of\r\nthe honour and “poll” degree[300] are so wide apart that the terms\r\nbachelors and masters of arts applied equally to all degree work, are\r\nmisleading. “He only wanted to take his degree, he did not work much”\r\nsomeone said to me a short time ago, and one felt one knew that degree.\r\nThe honours class standard is also variable, and “a good year” raises\r\nthe first class standard unduly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The double tripos.]\r\n\r\nThe condition which characterised Cambridge studies before 1850 was that\r\nthe mathematical tripos was obligatory on all candidates for honours.\r\nBetween 1823 therefore and 1850 every classic was obliged to pass in one\r\nof the three classes of the mathematical tripos--he had, that is, to\r\nsatisfy the examiners in two triposes. The results were often curious.\r\nMen like Macaulay, who became fellows of their college, were “ploughed”\r\nin the tripos, and professors of classics wrote _M.A._ after their names\r\nin virtue of a “poll” degree. The native repugnance to mathematical\r\nmethod in some men’s minds was constantly shown and at all stages of the\r\nuniversity curriculum; Stratford Canning was “sorely puzzled” and indeed\r\n“in an agony of despair” over the study for which he was a “volunteer”\r\nat King’s, and Gray refused to graduate rather than pursue it. On the\r\nother hand the Cambridge “double first” meant a degree unrivalled in any\r\npart of the world.[301]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD HOUSES NEAR ST. EDWARD’S CHURCH AND ST. EDWARD’S\r\nPASSAGE\r\n\r\nThis Passage leads from the Market into King’s Parade. Part of the South\r\nside of St. Edward’s Church is seen on the right. The Reformers Bilney,\r\nBarnes, and Latimer preached here. The three Tuns Inn, praised by Pepys\r\nfor its good liquor, formerly stood in this passage.]\r\n\r\nThe present conditions for obtaining the _B.A._ degree are (_a_)\r\nresidence for nine terms within the precincts of the university[302]\r\n(_b_) satisfying the examiners in one of the examinations, or groups of\r\nexaminations to which a degree is attached. One may satisfy them in one\r\nof four ways: (1) by reading for and obtaining ‘honours’[303] (2) by\r\ntaking the Previous, General, and Special examinations of the ordinary\r\ndegree[304] (3) by being ‘allowed the ordinary degree,’ which may\r\nhappen when a man fails to be placed in any class of a tripos, but when\r\nhis work is allowed to count as tantamount to the examinations of the\r\nordinary degree. (4) by being “excused the General,” which happens when\r\na man has failed in the tripos examination, but his work is counted as\r\nputting him half way towards the ordinary degree. The _aegrotat_ is a\r\nfifth way. If a man who has read for honours or for the ordinary degree\r\nfalls sick, he is allowed to answer one or two of the examination papers\r\nonly, and if he shows adequate knowledge of these is granted a degree,\r\nbut is not placed in any class.[305]\r\n\r\nThere have been frequent changes and regroupings in all the examinations\r\ndescribed, and other reforms are in contemplation. In 1850 the\r\nUniversities Commission led to radical changes at both universities. It\r\nis now proposed to simplify greatly Part I. of the mathematical tripos,\r\nplacing the candidates in divisions in alphabetical order, and thus\r\nabolishing the senior wrangler.[306] This classification is the rule in\r\nthe second parts of all the large triposes, all of which have been\r\ndivided since their formation. The abolition of compulsory Greek in the\r\nPrevious Examination is bruited and re-bruited, but for the moment the\r\nquestion has been set at rest (May 1906) by a decided negative vote of\r\nthe senate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The lecture and class.]\r\n\r\nThe method of tuition at Cambridge consists of the lecture, the class,\r\nthe weekly paper, and the examinations. “Reading” has, naturally, taken\r\nthe place of oral teaching to a large extent, but the lecture still\r\nholds its place in the university. In the view of many of the seniors\r\nthat place is still too large a one: the lecture at which copious\r\n(often verbatim) notes are taken is, no doubt, in many instances thrown\r\naway, especially in those subjects in which the lecturer simply goes\r\nover ground covered by the existing text-books. The class permits of\r\nlecturer and student discussing difficulties, and here the college\r\ntutor’s rôle is also of first importance;[307] the weekly paper (usually\r\na “time paper,” to be answered in three hours) tests progress in the\r\nsubject, and teaches a man how to “write down what he knows,” and to do\r\nso in a certain given time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Professorships.]\r\n\r\nThere was no salaried professorship in the university until Lady\r\nMargaret founded her chair of divinity in 1502. Before this, tuition in\r\neach faculty had been assigned to its doctors, the tuition in arts was\r\nleft in the hands of the masters of arts. The next three professorships\r\nto be founded were also in the 3 faculties: the Regius of Divinity by\r\nthe king in 1540, the Regius of Civil Law in the same year, and the\r\nRegius of Physic.[308] Henry also founded Regius professorships of\r\nHebrew and Greek. In 1632 Sir T. Adams founded the Arabic, and in 1663,\r\nHenry Lucas, M.P. for the university, the Lucasian of Mathematics; the\r\nKnightbridge of Moral Philosophy was founded by a fellow of Peterhouse\r\nin 1683. Between that date and 1899 (when the professorship of\r\nAgriculture was founded) 35 professorships have been endowed, 16 of\r\nwhich are in natural sciences and medicine, 5 for languages, 4 for\r\nhistory and archæology, 2 more for law, 1 for mental philosophy and\r\nlogic, and 3 more for divinity, one of which, the Norrisian, is tenable,\r\nand is now held by a layman. Fisher and Erasmus were the first holders\r\nof the Lady Margaret professorship, and Selwyn, Lightfoot, and Hort held\r\nit between the years 1855 and 1892. Bentley and Westcott held the Regius\r\nprofessorship (1717, 1870). Sir T. Smith was the first to hold the\r\nRegius of Civil Law, which was also held by Walter Haddon, and by Sir\r\nHenry Maine when he was twenty-five years old, Glisson of Caius was one\r\nof the distinguished holders of the Regius of Physic (1636), Metcalfe of\r\nS. John’s and Cudworth both held the Hebrew professorship, Sir J. Cheke\r\nwas the first to sit in the chair of Greek following on three such great\r\npredecessors and professors of Greek at Cambridge as Erasmus, Croke, and\r\nSir Thomas Smith. Isaac Barrow (1660), Porson (1792) and Sir R. C. Jebb\r\n(1889-1906), all Trinity men, have also held it. The Lucasian of\r\nMathematics was held by Barrow, then by Isaac Newton, then by his deputy\r\nWhiston of Clare, then by Sanderson of Christ’s, and the chair was\r\nfilled in the xix century by Airy and Sir George Stokes. Roger Cotes was\r\nthe first to hold the Plumian of Astronomy (1707) founded three years\r\npreviously by the Archdeacon of Rochester, who endowed it with an estate\r\nat Balsham. Professor Adams, the discoverer of Neptune, held the\r\nLowndean of Astronomy and Geometry (1858-1892). The Regius of Modern\r\nHistory (George I. 1724)[309] was held by the poet Gray, by Sir J.\r\nStephen, Charles Kingsley, Sir J. Seeley, and Lord Acton: the Cavendish\r\nprofessorship of Experimental Physics (founded by Grace of the Senate\r\n1871) was first filled by Clerk Maxwell and Lord Rayleigh; F. W.\r\nMaitland (ob. Dec. 1906) held the Downing of Law; and the new Quick\r\nprofessorship of biology has just been offered to an American\r\ngraduate.[310]\r\n\r\nNext in dignity to professors are the Readers in the different subjects,\r\nwho act as a sort of suffragans and assistants to professors; and next\r\nto these come the lecturers in branches of knowledge which range from\r\ncomparative philology to electrical engineering, from medical\r\njurisprudence to ethnology.[311]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lambeth degrees and degrees by royal mandate.]\r\n\r\nThe Pope was the fountain of graduate honour in the middle ages and\r\nconferred degrees in all the faculties, and he does so still. Doctors\r\nand masters from Rome would receive\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARKET STREET AND HOLY TRINITY CHURCH\r\n\r\nIn this picture Holy Trinity Church (of which Charles Simeon was\r\nincumbent) with its spire may be seen on the left. The cool grey\r\nbuilding in the middle of the picture is the Henry Martyn Hall, a modern\r\nstructure. In the distance is seen the Tower and North side of Great St.\r\nMary’s.]\r\n\r\nincorporation at Cambridge, and Englishmen without a degree would be\r\ngiven, on occasion, a degree by the Pope.[312] The general statute of\r\nHenry VIII. conveying\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1534.]\r\n\r\nto the primate all licences and dispensations which had heretofore “been\r\naccustomed to be had and obtained from Rome,” transferred the faculty of\r\nconferring degrees in England from the Pope to the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. This faculty had, until the date of the statute, formed part\r\nand parcel of the legatine powers, and had been exercised as such by\r\nWolsey. It was among the more important powers transferred under the\r\nstatute, relating to licences of the taxable sum of £4 and over, and\r\nrequired confirmation by Letters Patent under the great seal, or\r\nenrolment in Chancery. The right was exercised by successive\r\narchbishops, and every faculty so granted rehearsed the authority of\r\nparliament by which authority the said power was now vested in the see\r\nof Canterbury. In the reign of George I. the power was for the first\r\ntime disputed. The then Bishop of Chester refused to induct a Lambeth\r\n_B.D._ and a law suit followed, as a result of\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1722.]\r\n\r\nwhich a prescriptive and statutable right was made out for the practice.\r\nThe matter was then carried by appeal to the King’s Bench and decided in\r\nfavour of the archbishop, three years later, in 1725.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1660-1700.]\r\n\r\nFrom the accession of Charles II. till the end of the century the usual\r\nrecipients were members of one or other of the universities, and when\r\nthis was not the case incorporation in Cambridge university was granted\r\nwith the proviso that no precedent was thereby created. Between 1539,\r\nwhen Cranmer created a _D.D._, and the accession of Charles II., only\r\nseven instances of archi-episcopal degrees are recorded.[313] Over 450\r\nwere conferred between 1660 and 1848, and some 334 have been conferred\r\nsince.[314] A Cantabrigian primate confers the Cambridge hood, an\r\nOxonian the Oxford. There have been many instances of the incorporation\r\nof men who were recipients of the ‘Lambeth degree’ in one or other of\r\nthe colleges. The Lambeth _M.A._ does not include membership of the\r\nSenate or of Convocation.[315]\r\n\r\nDuring Stuart times there were several examples of the conferring of\r\ndegrees by royal mandate; a custom commuted to the now traditional\r\ncompliment, when a sovereign or prince receives a degree, of conferring\r\ndegrees on any persons he may wish associated with him in the honour.\r\nLord Stratford de Redcliffe, whose studies at Cambridge were\r\ninterrupted by diplomatic missions, was created _M.A._ by royal mandate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Ad eundem._]\r\n\r\n_Ad eundem_ degrees, admitting a graduate to the same degree which he\r\nalready enjoys elsewhere, are granted by all universities; but such\r\ndegrees are no longer granted at Cambridge as a simple right.[316]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honorary degrees, and the idea of a university.]\r\n\r\nThe university confers other “complete” or “titular” degrees on certain\r\npersons who have not qualified for them by residence and examination at\r\nCambridge. A list of those on whom this honour has been bestowed since\r\n1859 is printed in the Cambridge Calendar. The complete degrees are\r\nconferrable upon members of the royal family, privy councillors, bishops\r\nand bishops designate, peers,[317] the judges of the High Court, the\r\ndeans of Westminster, of the chapel royal Windsor, and of Cathedral\r\nchurches; and also upon heads of colleges in the university, and other\r\ndistinguished persons who already have a Cambridge degree and are either\r\nconspicuous for merit or holders of university office. Titular degrees\r\nmay be conferred on Englishmen or foreigners of conspicuous merit.\r\n\r\nA propos of a recent list of ‘birthday honours’ a weekly literary\r\nnewspaper reminded us “that commerce, politics, and retired generals are\r\nnot the only vitalizing forces in this country”; it blamed a public\r\nwhich it described as “increasingly illiterate and sheepish,” and\r\nadjured the universities to make no “concessions to popular prejudice”\r\nbut “to confine the honours they are able to give to those who deserve\r\nthem.” It is in fact ludicrous and absurd that the universities should\r\nbe expected to come in with their blessing in cases of non-academic\r\nsuccess, and that degrees should be mere acclamations of popular\r\nverdicts. The public should have every reason to regard these as the\r\nblue riband of academic attainment in contrast with the attainments of\r\nsuccessful ignorance or successful vulgarity, or indeed with all those\r\nkinds of success which are sufficiently rewarded by the _vox populi_,\r\nand in other ways. It is expected that a university should set a limit\r\nto the assumption that every good and perfect thing is at the beck and\r\ncall of the mere plutocrat, and should confer its honours and seat in\r\nits rectorial chairs only those persons who present academic\r\nqualifications. When one sees with what punctilious assiduity every mark\r\nand brand of tradesman and tradesmen’s interests receives recognition\r\nnowadays, one turns with anxiety to the Cambridge list of honorary\r\ndegree men. The university’s awards have not yet however been assigned\r\nto people who have grown rich on “Trusts,” business ‘slimness,’ or\r\nindustries like the canned meat industry; whose title to recognition is\r\nthat they have been successful speculators. How very nice it would be if\r\ninstead of installing gasometers in the leper colonies or sending the\r\nlatest pattern of trichord overstrung grand piano to the deaf and dumb\r\nschools of Europe and America, some rich man, with a less pretty taste\r\nfor publicity, should endow the university with a million pounds\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT ST. MARY’S, FROM TRINITY STREET\r\n\r\nHere we only get a glimpse of the Tower of the Church with King’s Parade\r\nin the distance. In the foreground on the right is Caius College.]\r\n\r\nsterling! Should he be the recipient of an honorary degree? Would it not\r\nbe churlish to refuse it? If anything could increase one’s respect for\r\nthe benefactor it would be _his_ refusal of this kind of recognition of\r\nhis services. However there is no harm in very occasional exceptions,\r\nbecause these shout the exceptional circumstances and confuse no one. It\r\nis different altogether when to create an honorary degree list Mr.\r\nAnybody and Mr. Nobody are called upon to step up. It seems a simple\r\nprogramme that periods marked by dearth in merit should also be marked\r\nby dearth of awards, but when did a simple programme ever prove\r\nattractive from the days of Naaman downwards?\r\n\r\nWhen we say that neither the elementary nor the advanced studies of a\r\nuniversity exist simply with a view to providing the members of the\r\ncommunity with a profession or the means of making their living, we say\r\nwhat is a little less obvious, and trench on ground which is hotly\r\ndebated. Thousands upon thousands, it may be urged, have always gone to\r\na university to learn a profession, and thousands who have not had this\r\nend in view have yet gone up there with no intention of acquiring\r\nlearning. The university has always prepared for the professions, why\r\nnot for the industries; why should it not comprise technical colleges?\r\nHitherto, however, the universities have prepared men for the learned\r\nprofessions, and there is a difference between learning philosophy,\r\ntheology, biblical exegesis, jurisprudence and political philosophy, or\r\nphysiology and comparative anatomy for the purposes of a life\r\nprofession, and learning agriculture, forestry, military tactics, or\r\nmining engineering. The growth of great branches of industry has however\r\nbeen as great as the growth of knowledge and the sciences; the\r\nconditions of modern life are entirely and altogether changed,\r\ncompetition extends far beyond the industrial world, to the universities\r\nthemselves, and to the struggle for existence of knowledge for its own\r\nsake. Without supposing that this last condition will be permanent, one\r\nmay still think that the universities could not refuse to teach what are\r\ncalled “the modern subjects,” which means industries like scientific\r\nagriculture or electrical engineering that have more money in them than\r\nthe professions. In a way, too, it is only a turning of the tables; when\r\nthe learned professions were studied it was because they promised the\r\nprofitable careers.\r\n\r\nIt need not by any means be competition which urges the university to\r\nundertake the ‘modern subjects’; it may be, and it is, the persuasion\r\nthat its rôle does not end with creating a career, that a university\r\npossesses advantages extrinsic to the degree taken, or even the work\r\ndone at it. The truth perhaps is that the present conditions of life\r\nafford an object to universities as far-reaching as has ever been\r\nallotted to them since their foundation. In these days of haste, and\r\nunchewed cuds of learning, they can suggest the value of leisure--and\r\nwhen a man is now sent to Cambridge or Oxford this fact alone is some\r\nsecurity that he and his are content not to put haste and quick results\r\nabove and before everything else. The lazy man we have always with us,\r\nthe man in a hurry is a modern product, and suffers from a modern\r\ndisease with which a university is better able, by latent influence and\r\ntradition, to deal than any other institution. And when it has taught\r\nthe value of intellectual digestion, the number of those things which\r\ncan only be well learnt by being gradually learnt, and in due season,\r\nhas the university nothing more to teach? Our modern malady of haste, of\r\nquick methods, and quick results has a commercial basis, a certain\r\nstandard of values and returns which is best so described. The academic\r\nspirit is the antagonist of this spirit, of the love of publicity, the\r\nself-advertisement, the liking for cheap and unearned rewards. Even as a\r\nbusiness maxim it is being preached again that work done for its own\r\nsake is the only lasting work. The university may be a bulwark against\r\nfalse values in life, against the restlessness which is confounded with\r\naction, the constant change which is not the same thing as adaptation,\r\nagainst the prejudice that certain good things are not always and\r\neverywhere ends in themselves. And there is another conspicuous service\r\nwhich a university can perform. The commercial standard is the root of\r\nour social vulgarity, and the academic life has been in all ages that\r\n‘simple life’ of which we hear so much. It is not necessary for\r\ngenerations of Englishmen to grow up to regard ‘poverty as a crime,’ or\r\nto subscribe to the worship of mere prosperity and success. A university\r\nmay always be a protest against these and other mental vulgarities,\r\nagainst even that debasing of the good coin of the King’s English in\r\nwhich Milton saw the incipient undoing of a nation. What better place\r\nfor combating the last ridiculous refuge of English _mauvaise\r\nhonte_--the shamefacedness which prefers to speak one’s own language\r\nincorrectly? Something every man at least who reads for a tripos must\r\nlearn about the uses of work, about its respect, something about breadth\r\nof view and accuracy of detail--and also about the legitimate support\r\nwhich such work is in life. It will be said that a man’s personal\r\ncharacter and his home life inculcate all these things and give him the\r\nmeans to meet the shafts of outrageous fortune. But what the university\r\ncan give him which his own personal character and probably his home\r\nsurroundings cannot, is the way to set about making of learning a\r\npossession for ever. Some nice person said “mathematics is such a\r\nconsolation in affliction,” and there is much to be said for the point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\nA university can teach these things because, unlike technical colleges\r\nor seminaries for the professions, it exists first and foremost for the\r\nadvancement of learning. Traditionally inseparable from this is its\r\nother object--education; and together they provide the tests it applies\r\nto all such questions as ‘how far it shall adapt itself to a commercial\r\nstandard.’ For a university is not only a place of higher studies, it is\r\nthe nursery of study; and to instil the love of learning for its own\r\nsake will always be required of it. In the words of Elizabeth of Clare:\r\n“When skill in learning has been found, it sends out disciples who have\r\ntasted its sweetness.” In the last resort universities must stand for\r\nthese things; the day when they cease to do so the idea of a university\r\nwill have oozed out of them. Like all good things the university will\r\nbring forth from its treasure things new and old. We shall not look for\r\ndegrees in cricket, but there may be degrees in agriculture, degrees in\r\nengineering, degrees in forestry. Why not, if a degree signifies a\r\ndiploma of competence? But there should be degrees and degrees. There\r\nshould be licentiates in the technical arts by the side of bachelors and\r\nmasters in the liberal arts: the university must claim to mete with its\r\nown measure, and to teach its own lesson to all sorts of men. _Hinc\r\nlucem et pocula sacra_----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCOLLEGIATE AND SOCIAL LIFE AT THE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\n     University and college officers:--chancellor and\r\n     vice-chancellor--the senate--graces--proctors--bedells--the master\r\n     of a college--the vice-master or president--the fellows--unmarried\r\n     and married fellows--the combination room--dons’ clubs--‘Hobson’s\r\n     choice’--the dons of last century--classes of\r\n     students:--scholar--pensioner--fellow-commoner--sizar--age of\r\n     scholars--privileges of peers--position of the sizar--college\r\n     quarters and expenses--‘non-colls’--early discipline--jurisdiction\r\n     of the university in the town--present discipline:--the\r\n     proctors--fines--‘halls’--‘chapels’--town\r\n     lodgings--expulsion--rustication--‘gates’--the tutor--academical\r\n     dress--cap and gown--the undergraduates’ day--the gyp--the college\r\n     kitchen--‘hall’--‘wines’--teas--the May\r\n     term--idleness--rioting--modern studies and tripos\r\n     entries--athletics--the Union Society--Sunday at Cambridge--scarlet\r\n     days--academic terms and the long vacation--multiplication of\r\n     scholarships--class from which the academic population has been\r\n     drawn and careers of university men:--the Church--the rise of an\r\n     opulent middle class--the aristocratic era--English conception of\r\n     the benefits of a university--examples of the classes from which\r\n     the men have come--recruiting grounds of the university--popularity\r\n     of colleges--numbers in the colleges--religion at\r\n     Cambridge--Cambridge politics--university settlement at\r\n     Camberwell--married dons and future changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that it is of the essence of a university that it should\r\nbe both a learned and a learning body, and that from the first the\r\nacademic group consisted of “masters” or licensed teachers, and of\r\nscholars maintained on the college foundations. Contemporaneously with\r\nthe growth of the college we find at the head of the university a\r\nchancellor, and at the head of the college its principal or\r\n“Master.”[318]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The chancellor.]\r\n\r\nA chancellor was originally a cathedral officer whose business it was to\r\ngrant licences to teach.[319] His connexion with schools of learning\r\nseems to be due entirely to the authority which diocesans exercised in\r\nthe granting of these licences, especially in the faculties of theology\r\nand canon law. It is then as a bishop’s officer that he makes his\r\nappearance at our universities; at Cambridge as the local officer of the\r\nBishop of Ely, at Oxford as the local officer of the Bishop of Lincoln.\r\n“The chancellor and masters” of the university of Cambridge are first\r\nheard of together in Balsham’s rescript, in the year 1276;[320] but\r\nHenry III.’s\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1275-6.]\r\n\r\nletter to the university written six years earlier is\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1270.]\r\n\r\naddressed to “the masters and scholars of Cambridge university.” It may\r\nthen be assumed that before this date the chancellor was still an\r\nepiscopal emissary rather than an academic chief, but that from about\r\nthis time he began to be chosen by themselves from among the\r\nregent-masters of the university, although with the approval of the\r\nBishop of Ely. This approval was not dispensed with until in 1396 a\r\nmember of the noble family of Zouche became chancellor; and the\r\nchancellor’s independence of the Bishop of Ely for confirmation of his\r\ntitle was made absolute by\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1402.]\r\n\r\nBoniface IX. six years later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vice-chancellor.]\r\n\r\nThe office was annual. The same man, however, was often appointed again\r\nand again, and Guy de Zouche himself had been chancellor in 1379 and\r\nagain in 1382. Bishop Fisher who retained the chancellorship until his\r\ndeath in 1534 was the first chancellor appointed for life.[321] As soon\r\nas it became customary to elect as chancellor of the university some\r\npersonage who would be able to represent its interests in the world\r\noutside, a vice-chancellor performed all those functions which before\r\nfell to the chancellor, and the position and functions of the present\r\nvice-chancellor are exactly equal to those of the old academic\r\nchancellor.[322] The first political chancellor succeeded the greatest\r\nof what, for distinction, I have called the academic chancellors of the\r\nuniversity. Thomas Cromwell took the post left vacant by Fisher’s\r\nmartyrdom and held it till his own downfall in 1540. The chancellorship\r\nis now held by the owner of a traditional Cambridge name, Spencer\r\nCavendish 8th duke of Devonshire.\r\n\r\nThe chancellor is appointed “for two years” or such further time “as the\r\ntacit consent of the university permits.” Under this proviso the\r\nappointment is practically for life. The vice-chancellor is appointed\r\nfrom among the heads of houses, and the office is annual. In each case\r\nthe appointment is in the hands of the senate, or legislative body of\r\nthe university which consists of all resident masters of arts and of\r\nthose non-resident _M.A.’s_ who have kept their names upon the\r\nuniversity register.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Senate and graces.]\r\n\r\nThe meetings of the senate take place in the Senate House and are called\r\ncongregations. In these, degrees are conferred and “graces” are\r\nconsidered; a “grace” being the name for all acts of the senate, or\r\nmotions proposed for its acceptance.\r\n\r\nResident members of the senate form the “electoral roll,” and elect the\r\ncouncil.[323] Lastly the executive body consists of the chancellor, the\r\nhigh steward,[324] the vice-chancellor, a commissary appointed by the\r\nchancellor, and the _sex viri_ who adjudicate on all matters affecting\r\nthe senior members of the university, are elected “by grace of the\r\nsenate,” and hold their office for two years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1603.]\r\n\r\nThe university has sent two members to parliament since the first year\r\nof James I. The exercise of the parliamentary suffrage belongs to the\r\nwhole senate and is the one exception to the rule which obliges every\r\nmember to record his vote personally in the Senate House.[325] The total\r\nnumber of members of the senate is 7192; the total number of members of\r\nthe university is 13,819, this latter including all bachelors of arts\r\nand undergraduates in residence, and all _B.A.’s_ whose names are on the\r\nbooks pending their proceeding to the degree of _M.A._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proctors.]\r\n\r\nAfter the vice-chancellor no officers are so much in evidence as the\r\nproctors. Their duties are twofold: they conduct the congregations of\r\nthe senate, and they maintain discipline among the undergraduates. There\r\nare 2 proctors elected annually, to whom are joined 2 pro-proctors, and\r\n2 additional pro-proctors. The pro-proctors have not the standing of the\r\nproctors as university officials, but they exercise the same authority\r\nover the men.[326] Other executive officers are the public orator, who\r\nis “the voice of the senate”[327]; the university librarian, the\r\nregistrary, the university marshal (appointed by the vice-chancellor)\r\nand the bedells.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bedell.]\r\n\r\nIf the proctor is the procurator of the academic society, the bedell is\r\nthe executor of its mandates. The bedells attend the (chancellor or)\r\nvice-chancellor on all public occasions, bearing silver maces, and, like\r\nthe beadles of all guilds and corporations, they summon members of the\r\nsenate to the chancellor’s court.[328] For bedel or bedell is an\r\nobsolete form of beadle retained in the ancient corporations of Oxford\r\nand Cambridge. As a town or parish officer the beadle brought messages\r\nand executed the mandates of the town or parish authority. The apparitor\r\nof a trades guild was also called a “bedel,” and it is, no doubt, as a\r\nguild officer that he appears in our universities and has taken so firm\r\na footing there.\r\n\r\nThe bedell was the servant of a faculty, and also of a “nation” in the\r\ncontinental universities: hence at Cambridge one was the bedell of\r\ntheology and canon law, the other of arts. They arranged and announced\r\nthe day and hour of lectures. For many centuries Cambridge had an\r\nesquire and a yeoman bedell; but the latter was abolished in 1858.\r\nApparently the yeoman bedell was not a member of the university, and he\r\nmay have been a townsman.[329] The two esquire bedells of the present\r\nday are nominated by the council of the senate, and elected by the\r\nlatter body.[330]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Master.]\r\n\r\nDistinct from the university authorities are the college authorities.\r\nThe foremost of these is the Master of each college. This officer used\r\nto be _primus inter pares_, the senior among the fellows or teaching\r\nbody of his house. The change to the later “splendid isolation” of the\r\n“Head” is expressed architecturally in the relative positions of the\r\nMaster’s lodging, as we can see it to-day in the old court of\r\nCorpus--the simple room leading to the dining hall and the college\r\ngarden with a garret bedroom above it--and the palatial dwellings which\r\nin one or two of the colleges no longer form part of the main buildings.\r\nIt is one which has a curious chronological parallel with the change\r\nthat took place in the relative positions of a cathedral dean and\r\nchapter after the Reformation. The old college Master, like the old\r\nuniversity chancellor, and the cathedral dean, was, officially and\r\nresidentially, part and parcel of the body he represented. After the\r\nReformation all these positions were shifted. The college Master became\r\nin appearance, what the cathedral dean had become in fact, “a\r\ncorporation sole,” while the university chancellor was translated to\r\nsupra-academic spheres, and no longer resided even in the university\r\ncity. “Sixty years since,” writes a present member of the university,\r\n“society at Cambridge was divided broadly into two classes--those who\r\nwere Heads and those who were not.” Ludicrous stories are told of the\r\npride which inflated “the Heads,” who at times resented being accosted\r\nnot only by the inferior undergraduate but by the fellows of their own\r\ncollege. The provost of King’s of just a hundred years ago was referred\r\nto familiarly by his irreverent juniors as ‘Tetoighty.’[331]\r\n\r\nHeads of colleges have not only the statutory powers conferred on them\r\nby their college, but as assessors to the vice-chancellor they join with\r\nhim in the government of the university. Their powers were largely\r\nincreased by the statutes of 1570 which Whitgift procured from\r\nElizabeth; and in 1586-7 it was decided that the vice-chancellor should\r\nalways be chosen from their number.[332] The modern “Head” emulates the\r\nold academic Master, is _primus inter pares_ amongst his fellow\r\ncollegians, and is no longer dreadful to his juniors.\r\n\r\nThere are only two exceptions to the title of Master held by all heads\r\nof colleges. The head of King’s College, like the head of Eton, is\r\nstyled Provost, and the head of Queens’ College is styled\r\nPresident.[333]\r\n\r\nThe vice-master is called the president. His position is like that of a\r\nprior under an abbot, or a subprior in a priory: the one representing\r\nthe college outside and ruling over the community, the other ruling in\r\nthe house and having the authority in all which concerns its management.\r\n\r\nWith the Master and vice-Master are associated the fellows, the dean,\r\nthe tutors, lecturers, chaplains, and the bursar.[334]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAKE IN BOTANIC GARDENS\r\n\r\nMany different kinds of trees surround this winding water, the banks of\r\nwhich are lined with a variety of rushes and reeds, and are inhabited by\r\nmany sorts of water-fowl.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fellows.]\r\n\r\n“I can never remember the time when it was not diligently impressed upon\r\nme that, if I minded my syntax, I might eventually hope to reach a\r\nposition which would give me three hundred pounds a year, a stable for\r\nmy horse, six dozen of audit ale every Christmas, a loaf and two pats of\r\nbutter every morning, and a good dinner for nothing, with as many\r\nalmonds and raisins as I could eat at dessert,” writes Trevelyan in his\r\n“Life and Letters” of Macaulay whose appreciation of a Cambridge\r\nfellowship fell nothing short of reverence.\r\n\r\nThe fellows are the foundation graduates, as the scholars are the\r\nfoundation undergraduates of a college. They are more; they are,\r\ncorporately, its masters and owners. Financially, a fellowship is\r\nrepresented by the dividend on the surplus revenue of a college.[335] As\r\nthis surplus revenue varies while the fellows are a fixed number, the\r\nvalue of fellowships varies, but may not now exceed £250 a year. A\r\nfellow enjoys as a rule other emoluments, as tutor, lecturer, librarian,\r\nbursar, of his college, so that his pecuniary position is by no means\r\nrepresented by the value of the simple fellowship. All fellowships are\r\nnow bestowed for a term of years; life fellowships being held by those\r\nonly who are on the staff of their college, who have served it, that is,\r\nin a tutorial or other official capacity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Married and unmarried fellows.]\r\n\r\nUntil the last quarter of the xix century fellows had to be bachelors.\r\nThe rule against married officials was first relaxed, after the\r\nReformation, in favour of heads of houses; Dr. Heynes, President of\r\nQueens’ in 1529, having been the first married Master.[336] Fifty years\r\nlater the fellows of King’s complained that the wife of their provost\r\nhad been seen taking the air on the sacred grass of the college court,\r\nwhere, nevertheless, her husband declared she could not have set her\r\nfoot twice in her life. Early in George III.’s reign a movement was\r\nafoot among the fellows of a different character: in 1766 Betham of\r\nKing’s writes to Cole that the university had been in a most violent\r\nflame: “young and old have formed a resolution of marrying”; “the scheme\r\nis--a wife and a fellowship with her.” In the “sixties” certain colleges\r\nbegan to admit married fellows, while in others a fellow might marry if\r\nhe held university office, as professor or librarian. No fellowship\r\nnowadays is confined to unmarried men.\r\n\r\nThis is one of three radical changes which the university has undergone\r\nin the last thirty years. The abolition of the Religious Test Act which\r\nsevered the strict connexion of our universities with the Church of\r\nEngland, the marriage of fellows, and the appointment of men not in\r\nclerical orders to fill the chief university and college offices, have\r\ngradually changed the face of university life, secularising it and\r\nsocialising it, bestowing on it, definitely, a lay and undenominational\r\ncharacter which is perhaps not so far from its primitive ideal as\r\nsticklers for the connexion of the universities with the Church would\r\nhave us believe. It is no longer an advantage to be in orders at\r\nCambridge: they do not help you to a fellowship for this is given to the\r\nbest man in open competition; even heads of colleges need no longer be\r\nclergymen, and only one collegiate office, that of the dean, is still\r\npreferably bestowed on a parson. The results are curious. Clerical\r\nfellows are popular, but theology is a neglected subject in the big\r\ncolleges and the theological chairs are not centres of influence. At the\r\nsame time every college enjoys clerical patronage, which can be\r\nexercised in favour of its deserving sons; and every college, besides\r\nits dean, appoints chaplains for the maintenance of the chapel\r\nservices.[337] Clerical fellows, it is true, are now in a minority, but\r\nthere seems to be no reason why the clerical don should cease to abound,\r\nas he has always abounded, in our university cities. A university\r\neducation has become more not less valuable for a clergyman now that it\r\nenables him to meet men whose beliefs differ widely from his own; now\r\nthat the right to display an academic hood in church is no longer prized\r\nas its chief advantage.[338]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The combination room.]\r\n\r\nAmong the ‘dons’ the centre of social life has always been the\r\ncombination room. It represents that pledge of civilisation the\r\nwith-drawing-room, the room contiguous to the banqueting-hall, where the\r\npleasures of the spirit steal an advantage over the pleasures of the\r\ntable. The rudeness which marked the period of the early renascence,\r\nfrom court to convent, in England, clung also to our academic life, and\r\nit is not till the last quarter of the xvi century that we find the\r\nfellows first provided with table napkins, and learn that the\r\nenterprising college which made the innovation exacted a fine of a penny\r\nfrom those who continued to wipe their fingers on the tablecloth. The\r\ntemptation to this latter practice must indeed have been great; for the\r\nfork which made its appearance at the dawn of the renascence in France\r\nwas unknown in England two hundred years later. It is only in the course\r\nof the next, the xviith, century that the combination room emerges as a\r\nmore or less luxurious apartment; the subsequent addition of newspapers,\r\nmagazines, and easy chairs marking in turn the rise of journalism and\r\nthe higher standard of comfort. The dons of Charles II.’s time who had\r\nto be content with the “London Gazette” supplemented the lack of news by\r\nsocial clubs. “The Ugly Faces” club dined periodically in what was then\r\nthe ugliest of college halls--Clare. “The Old Maids’ Club” flourished\r\nin the early xix century, with Baker the antiquary, Tonstall, and\r\nConyers Middleton as members. The first “news letter” was however laid\r\non the table of Kirk’s coffee-house in Charles’s reign. The first\r\nflying-coach, following the example of Oxford which had run a coach to\r\nLondon in one day, sped to the Capital in 1671.[339]\r\n\r\nWhen the xix century opened there was no general society in Cambridge.\r\nIt was more out of the way of polite England than Oxford, and many dons\r\nwhose homes were at a distance spent the whole year in their colleges,\r\nemphasising the faults and therefore detracting from the virtues of\r\nsmall learned societies. The dons in the xvi century, say at S. John’s\r\nCollege, had been a brilliant company who bestowed as much on the\r\nElizabethan age as they took from it: but the xviii century closed upon\r\na period of dulness and reaction, in which the rudeness of material\r\ncivilisation met a social uncouthness little calculated to recall the\r\nuniversity of Spenser, of Burleigh, of Bacon. The intimacy between the\r\nfellows and their head was a thing of the past; the familiarity between\r\nscholar and don had been replaced by “donnishness” which kept the\r\nundergraduate at arm’s length; the blight of the artificial and stilted,\r\nthe sterile and pompous aristocratism of just a century ago had settled\r\ndown upon the university. Isolated in this eastern corner of England,\r\njust before the enormous impulse to travelling brought by railways, just\r\nafter the cosmopolitan spirit which took even the Englishman abroad--the\r\nsense of a debt to Italy, of a continental comradeship--had finally\r\nceased to exist, Cambridge dons at the dawn of the xix century had\r\nperhaps fathomed the lowest social depths. But before this century\r\npassed a social change more wonderful than the material changes around\r\nthem metamorphosed university society. The unmannerly don married; and\r\nthe sex which makes society, the sex which suffers no social\r\ndeterioration when left to its own devices--the aristocratic sex--was\r\nintroduced as the don’s helpmeet. More still--worse still--she was\r\nintroduced in the same quarter of a century as what the weak-kneed among\r\nus cry out upon--his rival. It is the same donnish bachelor, separated\r\nby a gulph from the social amenities, wedded to ingrained habits and\r\nsome eradicable prejudices, who suffered women to come to Cambridge and\r\ntake what they could of the intellectual advantages he himself enjoyed.\r\nThe historian of the great movements of the age we live in will record\r\nwith interest this proof of the traditional open-mindedness which has\r\nnever deserted the Cantabrigian, which has never failed to respond to\r\nthe sacred dual claims of the age and the intellect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARKER’S PIECE\r\n\r\nThis large open space in the centre of Cambridge is one of the Town’s\r\nplaygrounds. In the distance is the Roman Catholic Church, and the\r\nboundary wall of the Perse Grammar School, just behind the trees on the\r\nleft.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Classes of students.]\r\n\r\nThe learned body which congregates in the combination rooms is the\r\n_ecclesia docens_ of the university; the learning body--the _ecclesia\r\ndiscens_--includes all members of the university below the degree of\r\n_M.A._, and is divided into four or five classes. The most important of\r\nthese from the academic point of view is the scholar, and for at least\r\ntwo centuries after colleges were built the only resident students were\r\nthese students on the foundation.[340] To them were joined in course of\r\ntime the _pensioners_, youths who paid for their board and lodging, the\r\nclass which now makes up the great majority of undergraduates. Two other\r\nclasses were added. The peers and eldest sons of peers with other\r\n_fellow-commoners_--a class which has fallen into practical desuetude\r\nbut is not obsolete--and the _sizars_. The peers enjoyed some privileges\r\nwhich would not be coveted nowadays--they could make themselves\r\nconspicuous on all occasions by their clothing, and they could take a\r\ndegree without working for it. The younger sons of peers and the richer\r\nundergraduates also messed at the fellows’ table, and were therefore\r\ncalled “fellow-commoners”: the advantages of this arrangement did not\r\nend with the better treatment in hall, for the companionship of the\r\nfellows and seniors of his college must have proved a welcome stimulus\r\nto an intelligent young man.[341] Lastly, there were and are the\r\n“sizars,” the poorer students, not on the foundation of the college, who\r\npay smaller fees and receive their commons gratis.[342] The sizar of\r\nfifty years ago used to wait on the fellows at dinner and dine off the\r\nbroken victuals, reinforced by fresh vegetables and pudding.\r\n\r\nWhen Macaulay summed the advantages of a Cambridge fellowship he omitted\r\nperhaps the chief, the college residence which like “the good dinner” is\r\nto be had “for nothing.” Fellows and scholars receive their college\r\nquarters gratis; but the rest of the undergraduate population pays for\r\nits lodging. It is housed in its 17 colleges, the new hostels which are\r\nspringing up on all sides, and the licensed lodgings in the town. The\r\ncost of the college bed and sitting room a term varies from £3 to three\r\ntimes this sum. Service adds £2 or £3 a term. Small lodgings with\r\nservice can be had in the less good streets for £5-£7; good rooms from\r\n£8 to £10, while more than £12 is only charged in the best positions, or\r\nnear the big colleges. The expense of college rooms is augmented by the\r\nprepayments for furniture (the average valuation of the permanent\r\nfurniture is £20, but the sum may be as low as £10 or as high as £40),\r\nby the “caution money,” about £15, returned at the end of the term of\r\nresidence, the admission fee (varying with the college from 6/8 to £5)\r\nand the matriculation fee £5. During residence there is also an annual\r\npayment of £9-15 towards the upkeep of the college and its servants,\r\nand the tuition fee, which covers all lectures in one’s own college, and\r\nvaries from £18 to £24 a year.\r\n\r\nIt was to obviate the necessity of paying these fees that the system of\r\nnon-collegiate students, familiarly called “non-colls,” was devised in\r\n1869. While the expenses of an undergraduate who is a member of a\r\ncollege average about £165 a year, £60 in excess of this and £60 less\r\nrepresenting the higher scale of expenses on the one hand and the\r\nminimum on the other, the undergraduate who lives in lodgings and _is\r\nnot a member of any college_ can live for £78 a year (if he does not\r\nrequire “coaching” or private tuition which costs about £9 a term) and\r\nit is just possible to take the _B.A._ degree after a three years’\r\nresidence which has cost you at the rate of £55 a year.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago the minimum cost of living at Cambridge for a pensioner\r\nwas £150 and double this sum involved no extravagant outlay. A\r\nfellow-commoner required £800 a year and could not live on less than\r\n£500. These were the aristocratic days of English universities and they\r\nwere in sharp contrast to the time when scholars were poor, begged their\r\nway to and from college, and were included among vagabonds in the\r\nstatute of 1380 directed against mendicancy. But the entertainment in\r\nthose days was also widely different. Two fellows shared not only a room\r\nbut a bed, or a two-bedded room would be shared by a fellow and two poor\r\nscholars. It was not till the xvi century that each fellow had a bed to\r\nhimself and a room to himself if space permitted.[343] The dining hall\r\nwas a comfortless room where rude fare was served at a tresselled board\r\nto guests who sat upon wooden stools. The conditions of the xiii and xiv\r\ncenturies were not greatly bettered in the xvth and xvith, and Erasmus\r\nfound it hard to stomach the fare at Queens’ College at a time when the\r\nCambridge ale appears to have been no improvement on the “wine no better\r\nthan vinegar” which came from the surrounding vineyards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early discipline.]\r\n\r\nThe little lads who thronged the streets of Cambridge in the xiii\r\ncentury were under little or no discipline. They ran up debts with the\r\nJews, who had established themselves there in the opening years of the\r\nprevious century, fought the townsmen, and had few duties to society\r\nbeyond making their own beds, a work certainly performed by university\r\nscholars in the xiii and xiv centuries and enjoined on the boys of the\r\nfamous schools founded in the xvth. It was this custom of doing your own\r\nwork, at least until you became an advanced student when the little boys\r\ndid it for you, which was the origin of “fagging” in our two most\r\nancient schools connected respectively with our two universities--Eton\r\nand Winchester.[344] Even this amount of work, however, was not expected\r\nof fellow-commoners in the xvi century, who frequently got out of hand,\r\nthough few of them have left us so delightful a reminder of their\r\nmisdeeds as the young Earl of Rutland has done in a letter to his\r\nmother who had complained of his behaviour: “I do aseure your Ladyship\r\nthat the cariage of myselfe both towardes God and my booke, my\r\ncomeliness in diet and gesture, shall be such as your Ladyship shall\r\nhear and like well of.”\r\n\r\nWith the great era of college building in the succeeding century, the\r\nfounders’ statutes make their appearance; and in days when monks were\r\nbirched and nuns were slapped the college stocks held in durance vile\r\nthe fellow who had presumed to bathe in any stream or pool of\r\nCambridgeshire, while the college hall resounded to the strokes of the\r\nbirch which visited the scholar for the same offence. College discipline\r\nwas supplemented by university discipline, and the academic authorities\r\nshared legal powers with the town authorities until recently. The\r\njurisdiction of the university extended not only to matters affecting\r\nits members, but to a _conusance_ in actions which affected the\r\ntownsmen.[345] The last attempt to exercise the right of imprisoning\r\nundesirable characters in the “Spinning House” was made by the\r\nvice-chancellor in 1893; but the incarceration of a young woman on this\r\noccasion caused so much indignation in the town that it led to the final\r\ndisallowance of all the vice-chancellor’s powers, in this direction,\r\nwhich were waived by the university in 1894.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Present discipline--proctors, fines, “hall,” “chapels.”]\r\n\r\nUniversity discipline is in the hands of the vice-chancellor and his\r\ncourt,[346] and the proctors. College discipline in those of the\r\ndean[347] and tutors. Two proctors perambulate the town every night,\r\neach accompanied by two servants known to the undergraduate as the\r\nproctor’s “bull-dogs.” They take the name of any offending student and\r\nbring him up next morning if necessary before the vice-chancellor. They\r\ncan also send men back to their college or rooms, enter lodgings, and\r\nexact fines. When the youth of 19 or 20 leaves the higher forms of a\r\npublic school and comes to the university, he is treated as a man, and\r\nleads a man’s life guided by himself. But he becomes also a member of a\r\ngreat society, existing for certain purposes. If he is a man, he is a\r\nvery young one; and if he guides his own life he has only just begun to\r\ndo so. He lives in his own house--for his college room, like the\r\nEnglishman’s dwelling, is his castle--but he must be at home by 10 p.m.\r\n\r\nThis is the first point of discipline. The gates of colleges and the\r\nouter doors of lodgings are shut at 10, and any one who presents himself\r\nafter that hour, without his tutor’s permission, has his name taken by\r\nthe college porter, or by the lodging proprietor who acts _in loco\r\njanitoris_. He must also dine in hall, if not every day at least five\r\ntimes in the week, which must include Sunday. The third restriction on\r\nhis liberty is (or at least was originally) a care for his soul. The\r\nobligation to attend chapel so many times a week resolves itself now\r\ninto two attendances in the week and generally two on Sunday. No means\r\nof enforcing this are however taken nowadays, and the men are generally\r\nleft free to judge for themselves in this respect, though ‘moral\r\nsuasion’ is exercised by the deans except in the case of nonconformists\r\nand conscientious objectors. Fifty years ago 8 “chapels” were expected;\r\nbut if a pensioner kept 6 and a fellow-commoner 4, he was left\r\nuntroubled by his dean. In New England at the same epoch no less than 16\r\nattendances at chapel every week were required, seven at unseasonable\r\nhours; a burden which was tolerated with more cheerfulness by the New\r\nEnglander than were the 8 “chapels” by his Cambridge contemporary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Town licences. Expulsion “rustication”. “gating.”]\r\n\r\nThe licensing of all lodgings and places of entertainment[348] to which\r\nundergraduates may go, is the hold which the university has over the\r\ntown. Its sanctions for the undergraduate are fines and expulsion;\r\nbreaches of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRINITY BRIDGE, KING’S COLLEGE CHAPEL IN THE DISTANCE\r\n\r\nThis is one of the many charming views on the Cam at “the Backs” of the\r\nColleges.]\r\n\r\ncollege rules being visited by “gating” and expulsion. A man can be\r\nexpelled for any cause which in the judgment of the university or the\r\ncollege warrants it. If a man thus expelled from the university society\r\nrefuses “to go down”--to leave Cambridge--he cannot live in any licensed\r\nlodging house in the town.[349] A man may also be sent down for a term,\r\nwhich is called “rustication,” an epithet which suggests to him that he\r\nhas forfeited the society of men of polite learning. If a man misbehaves\r\nhimself he can be “gated,” _i.e._ the porter receives instructions not\r\nto let him out after a certain hour--and it may be any hour the\r\nauthorities choose to fix and for any length of time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The tutor.]\r\n\r\nThe college tutor is the official who supervises the undergraduate’s\r\nacademic career. He advises him what subject to read for, what\r\nexaminations to take, what books to master. The career of a mediocre man\r\nis often made and that of a first-rate man heightened by an able tutor,\r\nand Cambridge has boasted some very great men in this capacity. The\r\nmathematical genius of Newton was quickened by having for his tutor\r\nIsaac Barrow; Whichcote of Emmanuel, Laughton of Clare, and Shilleto of\r\nTrinity were eminent as tutors and “coaches”; and “coaching”\r\nsupplements, for a very backward or a very advanced student, the\r\nlectures of college and university.[350]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The cap and gown.]\r\n\r\nThe academic appearance of a university owes much to the traditional cap\r\nand gown worn by all its members. A bonnet and gown are very ancient\r\nappanages of the learned professions of divinity law and medicine--they\r\nwere the dignified apparel of doctors in the three faculties. Short hose\r\nhad not become fashionable when universities sprang into existence, and\r\nthe clerk or scholar even if he were not destined for major was very\r\nusually in minor orders: the gown is therefore a fitting distinction for\r\nthose learned societies which have never ceased their corporate\r\nexistence, and have carried into modern times, as a special dress, items\r\nof attire which like clerical vestments, the cassock, the monastic\r\nhabit, and the friar’s tunic were proper to the age which saw their\r\nrise.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive features of academic dress are simply survivals of this\r\nordinary dress of the period: the ceremonial hood is the hood which was\r\nworn in everyday life in the xiith the xiiith xivth and xvth\r\ncenturies.[351] If we had looked in at the priory church of Barnwell on\r\na day when the novices made their profession we should have seen each\r\none enter dressed in the black habit or gown, a cloak of fur, and the\r\n“amess[352] over his head”: and when he walked out he was already vested\r\nwith the _capa nigra_ of the canon. Here, then, we have all the elements\r\nof early academic dress; the homely Gilbertine canons, so familiar in\r\nthe Cambridge thoroughfares, wore it in white; for it was the dress of\r\nthe more respectable, the decently clad, clergy and clerks as well as of\r\nthose most respectable and regular clergy, the canons. The dress of the\r\nbetter looked-after scholars on the college foundations differed but\r\nlittle from this. No doubt the scholars of Peterhouse habitually wore\r\nthe clerical _vestis talaris_[353]--the gown to the ankle--but the\r\nspecial item of academic attire adopted at Cambridge appears to have\r\nbeen the _capa nigra._[354] The majority of scholars in the hostels and\r\ngrammar schools observed no general rule as to costume,[355] but the\r\nscholars of any standing wore the black cappa of the canon; and the\r\nhood, lined with sheepskin or minever, was becoming--even in the xiv\r\ncentury--the habitual, and therefore distinctive, dress of foundation\r\nscholars when they “commenced” bachelor or master.[356] The hood indeed\r\nwas probably restricted to an academic use before this century closed,\r\nfor there is a statute of the year 1413 ordering hoods of kid or\r\nlambskin to be worn. The incepting Cambridge bachelor,[357] then, wore a\r\n_cappa_, a fine hood was gradually restricted to the master of arts.\r\n\r\nThe soft bonnets or caps--of doctors, bishops, jurists, canons--are\r\nderivatives of the hood, as is the stiff cap--the biretta, as is the\r\nmitre itself. The xviii century Cambridge student still wore a soft\r\nround cap, like that worn to-day by the Italian university student and\r\nquite recently adopted in France: but the Paduan doctors had adopted the\r\nstiff square cap in the xvi century, and our own students revolted\r\nagainst the round cap in 1769, and thereupon accomplished the feat\r\nwhich neither Archimedes “nor our Newton” had attempted:\r\n\r\nFor all her scholars square the circle now.[358]\r\n\r\nThe chancellor of the university wears a black and gold robe. Scarlet is\r\nthe colour of the doctors’ gowns, as it still is of the papal doctors of\r\ndivinity. The physician of Chaucer’s time wore his furred scarlet gown,\r\nand scarlet gowns and corner caps were worn by the Cambridge doctors\r\nwhen the Cromwells entertained James I. on his way from the north in\r\n1603.\r\n\r\nThe master wears a full-sleeved gown of stuff or silk; the bachelor’s\r\ngown has two flowing bands hanging loose in front; the undergraduate’s\r\ngown is both scantier and shorter than these; but ‘Advanced Students’\r\nwear the bachelor’s gown, without the loose bands. The academic gown of\r\nEnglish universities is now black, but the earlier violet gown of\r\nTrinity is recorded in the present blue gown of its undergraduates, a\r\nblue gown being also worn by the neighbouring college of Gonville and\r\nCaius.[359] The gowns of certain colleges are distinguished by little\r\npleats in the stuff or bars of velvet.\r\n\r\nPeers and eldest sons of peers, in the first half of the xix century,\r\nwore the black silk gown and tall silk hat of an _M.A._,[360] and on\r\ngreat occasions a more splendid dress adorned with gold tassels and\r\nlace. Fellow-commoners wore a gown with gold or silver lace and a black\r\nvelvet cap; the younger sons of peers being known as “Hat-fellow-commoners”\r\nbecause they wore the _M.A.’s_ silk hat instead of the velvet cap.\r\n\r\nMost of the pensioners at Cambridge in the xviii century (but not the\r\nfellow-commoners) used to wear a sleeveless gown called a\r\n“curtain.”[361] Neither the clerical cassock nor the _capa nigra_ in\r\nfact account for the undergraduate’s dress of later or present times;\r\nthe original of which, I think, is to be found in the sleeveless gown or\r\ncoat, called _soprana_, of the ecclesiastical colleges founded between\r\nthe xv and xvii centuries. Two of the peculiarities of the _soprana_ are\r\nstill traceable. The bands of the bachelor’s gown may be seen attached\r\nto the black coat of the _Almum Collegium_ founded in 1457 by Cardinal\r\nCapranica, to the violet and black dress worn by the Scotchmen,[362] to\r\nthe red coat of the college founded by Ignatius Loyola, and the blue of\r\nthe Greek College founded by Gregory XIII.; while one string, adorned\r\nwith the papal arms, is left on the _soprana_ worn by the Vatican\r\nseminarists: these are leading strings, denoting the state of\r\npupilage.[363] The Cambridge scholar’s and bachelor’s gown is black--the\r\ndescendant of the full black _cappa_--but as we have just seen the coat\r\nor gown of the ecclesiastical colleges is of different colours, and the\r\nancient gowns of Trinity and Caius still record this variation.\r\n\r\nEvery one _in statu pupillari_ must wear cap and gown after nightfall,\r\non Sunday,[364] at examinations and lectures (except laboratory\r\ndemonstrations), when visiting the vice-chancellor or any other official\r\non academic business, in the library, the Senate House, and the\r\nuniversity church: professors and others usually wear the gown while\r\nlecturing, and all dons wear it in chapel and hall.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The undergraduates’ day.]\r\n\r\nA twentieth century undergraduates’ day does not differ from those\r\nrecorded in his diary by Wordsworth’s brother when he was a freshman at\r\nTrinity in 1793.[365] This is how he was employed during the Reign of\r\nTerror and within a few days of the execution of Marie\r\nAntoinette:--“Chapel. Lectures. Considered of a subject for my essay on\r\nWednesday se’nnight. Drank wine with Coleridge. Present the _Society_.\r\nChapel. Read ‘Morning Chronicle.’ Found in it an ode to Fortune, by\r\nColeridge, which I had seen at Rough’s yesterday. Read _ratios_ and\r\n_variable quantities_, and Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy.” It was\r\nindeed rather in its outer than in its inner circumstance that the life\r\neven of the xiii and xiv century undergraduate differed from that of the\r\nxxth. Then as now he listened to doctors in their faculties and his own\r\ncollege seniors expounding the mysteries of art and science; then, as\r\nnow, he supplemented these lectures with private reading, then, seated\r\nupon a wooden stool in a corner of a crowded room, or in the college\r\nlibrary, or best of all in the college meadows; now, in a comfortable\r\narm chair or stretched upon a sofa in his private sitting room.[366]\r\nThen, as now, he caroused or discussed “the universe” with his friends,\r\nas his nature suggested. Then, as now, he made early acquaintance with\r\nthe river Granta and knew each yard of the flat roads round the\r\nuniversity town. Even the periodical outbreak between “town and gown”\r\nbelongs as much to the xiii century as to the most recent history in\r\nthe xxth.[367]\r\n\r\nLectures take place in the morning, “coaching” and private study usually\r\nin the late afternoon and evening. Two to four is the chosen time for\r\nrecreation, and the chief recreations of the Cantab used to be the road\r\nand the river. The latter runs familiarly past the windows of his\r\ncollege rooms, and invites him as he steps forth from the threshold of\r\nhis college court. Boating, swimming, or fishing, the student of a\r\nbye-gone day found in the Granta a never-failing and an inexpensive\r\nresource. Cambridge fish as we have seen has always been famous, and the\r\nMerton scholars poached upon the townsmen’s fishing rights long before\r\nthe xiii century was out.\r\n\r\n“Your success in the Senate House” said a well-known tutor “depends much\r\non the care you take of the three-mile stone out of Cambridge. If you go\r\nevery day and see no one has taken it away, and go quite round it to\r\nwatch lest any one has damaged its farthest side, you will be best able\r\nto read steadily all the time you are at Cambridge. If you neglect it,\r\nwoe betide your degree. Exercise, constant, and regular, and ample, is\r\nabsolutely essential to a reading man’s success.” And the reading men\r\nhave taken the lesson to heart. No roads until the era of bicycles were\r\nbetter tramped than the flat Cambridge roads which lend themselves so\r\nwell to this form of recreation; pair after pair of men, tall and small,\r\na big and a little together, used to keep themselves informed as to\r\ntheir state of repair, or lose the sense of space and time in\r\ndiscussions on the modern substitute for “quiddity” and _essentia_, or\r\nthe social and biological problems which are newer even than these.\r\n\r\nOnce back in his college the persons on whom the undergraduate’s comfort\r\nmost depends are the college cook the bedmaker and the “gyp.” The last\r\ncalls him, brushes his clothes, prepares his breakfast, caters for him,\r\nserves his luncheon, waits on him and his friends, and carries back and\r\nforth the little twisted paper missives which, as an American noticed\r\nfifty years ago, Cambridge undergraduates are perpetually exchanging.\r\nAll these services the gyp may have to perform for a number of other\r\nmen. The only woman servant is the “bedmaker” whose name sufficiently\r\ndescribes her official business, but who for the great majority of\r\nmodern students discharges the functions of gyp. The college kitchen is\r\na busy centre. Here is prepared not only the hall dinner but all private\r\nbreakfasts and luncheons served in college rooms; and most of the\r\ncollege kitchens supply luncheons and dinners to residents in the town\r\nif required. Dinner in hall costs from one shilling and tenpence to two\r\nshillings and a penny, according to the college; bread and butter\r\ncalled “commons” can be had from the buttery for 6d. a day; a breakfast\r\ndish at a cost of from 6d. to 1/; and at some college halls a luncheon\r\nis served at a small fixed charge.[368]\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago the undergraduate dressed for “hall” with white silk\r\nstockings and pumps and white silk waistcoat. A few wore powder, the\r\nothers curled their hair, and he was a bucolic youth indeed who omitted\r\nat least the curling. “Curled and powdered” the Cambridge scholar wore\r\nhis hair even in the xiv century provoking the indignation of primates\r\nand founders. A hundred and fifty years ago beer was served for\r\nbreakfast, and only Gray and Walpole drank tea. Even fifty years ago the\r\nfood was roughly served and in an overcrowded hall. It was however\r\nabundant, and extras like soup, confectionery, and cheese could be\r\n“sized for” _i.e._ brought you at an extra charge. The food provided\r\nconsisted of plain joints and vegetables, with plenty of beer. The\r\nfellows’ table and the side tables of the bachelors were better served.\r\n\r\n“The wine,” the famous entertainment which followed the old four o’clock\r\ndinner fifty years ago, has yielded place to coffee and tea. In the May\r\nterm teas assume new proportions; for during the term which is fateful\r\nto the reading man as that preceding the tripos examination, the idle\r\nman turns work time into play, invites his friends and relatives up to\r\nCambridge, and entertains his sisters at “the races.” It is not indeed\r\nto be supposed that the majority of undergraduates are to be found\r\nkeeping themselves awake with black coffee, a damp towel bound about\r\ntheir brows, while they burn the midnight oil. Even the harmless\r\nnecessary “sporting of one’s oak” is no longer “good form.” In days when\r\nyou advertise for a curate and a schoolmaster who is a good athlete the\r\nvery thin literary proclivities of the bulk of Englishmen cannot be held\r\nto be on the increase. What one might legitimately hope for is that\r\nathletics should prove a safety-valve to the natural “rowdyism” of the\r\nnon-reading man; so that if school and university sports cannot make a\r\nscholar they might at least turn out something not unlike a gentleman.\r\nLast October (1905) proved a “record” in the number of men “going up,”\r\nand November proved “a record” in the number of men who should have been\r\n“sent down.” What took place is fresh in our memories; and it will not\r\nquickly be forgotten that while the undergraduates of one university\r\nwere shouting their disgrace, a well-known bishop was signalising (and\r\nexaggerating) the disgrace of the other; and we may choose between the\r\nmerits of leaguing with the town blackguard to kick policemen at\r\nCambridge or indulging the vice which changed the name of “wines” at\r\nOxford to “drunks.” At the rejoicings for Mafeking the iron railings\r\nand posts were torn up along the ‘backs,’ and everything combustible\r\nfrom drays to handcarts was “commandeered” to make a bonfire on Market\r\nhill, where many panes of glass in the surrounding houses were smashed.\r\nProctors’ “bull-dogs” were rolled over in the mud, and the proctors\r\ntreated to the dignity of a “chairing.”[369] The bonfire on Market hill\r\nis a development of a traditional ritual more amusing and less\r\ndangerous: you drag out your own and your friends’ furniture and make a\r\nbonfire in the middle of the college “court.”\r\n\r\nWould it be impossible, among so many good rules, to make cap and gown\r\nobligatory at both universities between the hours of 9 and 12? The\r\nspectacle of youths hugging golf clubs on the Oxford station at ten\r\no’clock in the morning cannot be extraneous to examination results which\r\nshow that not 3 men in 4 who matriculate, take the _B.A._ At Cambridge\r\nthere is good promise in the large increase of scientific students who\r\ntake advantage of the facilities afforded by its laboratories: more men\r\nentered for the “doctors’ college” in October 1905 than for any other,\r\nexcept of course Trinity; and even “the sporting college” has been a\r\nprincipal contributor to the number of medical graduates. Since 1883\r\nthere has been a board of Indian Civil Service studies, and the\r\nuniversities between them send up far the larger number of candidates\r\nfor this service. A board of agricultural studies was instituted in\r\n1899, a diploma in agriculture is now awarded, also one in sanitation,\r\nand geographical studies are encouraged by prizes. Since 1899, when the\r\ntripos was divided, the Historical has become one of the larger triposes\r\nand in 1905 had the highest number of entries after the Natural\r\nSciences.[370]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: University athletics.]\r\n\r\nThe traditional rivalry in sports has of course been that between the\r\ntwo universities. The inter-university boat race was begun in 1836, and\r\nthe first 4 races were won by Cambridge, as was also the first race\r\nrowed in outriggers in ’46. Of the 64 races run, Oxford has won 6 more\r\nthan Cambridge; Cambridge has won 5 out of the last 6, and has also won\r\nby the greater number of lengths (in ’49 by “many,” and in 1900 by\r\n20).[371] The great inferiority of the ‘Cam’ to the ‘Isis’ is partly\r\ncompensated by the excellent style of rowing which Eton\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOWER OF ST. JOHN’S COLLEGE CHAPEL FROM THE RIVER\r\n\r\nTrinity College Library lies on the right, through the trees.]\r\n\r\ntraditions carry on into Cambridge. The happy connexion between\r\nCambridge and Eton established by Henry VI. has never ceased to link the\r\nmost aristocratic English school with the more democratic of the English\r\nuniversities, and many boys come to the “light blue” university already\r\nwearing her favours. In football and golf the two universities have\r\nshown equal prowess; Cambridge cricket is superior (the inter-university\r\nmatch was started in 1839 and Cambridge won the first 6 matches), and in\r\nathletics (1868-1906) Cambridge took the lead until the Rhodes scholars\r\narrived at the sister university.\r\n\r\nThe Union Society forms another distraction well calculated to turn out\r\nthe English ideal of a university man--a man, _id est_, ready for public\r\naffairs. It was founded in 1815 by the _union_ of three already existing\r\ndebating societies, the present building was erected in 1866 and fitted\r\nup as a club. Stratford Canning (Lord Stratford de Redcliffe) and\r\nBlomfield, afterwards Bishop of London, belonged to one of these earlier\r\n“spouting clubs” in 1806, where Palmerston and Ellenborough both “laid\r\nthe foundation” of their parliamentary fame. The college ball and the\r\ncollege concert are also crowded into the student’s seven weeks of\r\nresidence in the May term, taking the place of the plays which formed\r\nthe staple entertainment in the xvi and xvii centuries. The modern\r\n“A.D.C.” has been rendered famous by the “Greek Plays” which were\r\ninaugurated twenty-five years ago with a performance of “Ajax.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sunday at Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nBut the round of work and play comes to an end with Sunday, and the\r\nuniversity has preserved the festival aspect of this day, the day when\r\ncontinental beadles and _gens d’armes_ don their fine plumes and when\r\nwhat is bright and gay rather than what is dull and grave is mated to\r\nthe idea of a day of rest. The college courts--the outdoor centre and\r\nrallying point of college life--are thronged with men gay in surplice or\r\ngown[372] as they were thronged on that Sunday 370 years ago when\r\nStephen Gardiner Bishop of Winchester found two hundred dons assembled\r\n“as is their wont” and buttonholed the men who were likely to pleasure\r\nhis grace in the matter of the divorce. That fine day in the xvi century\r\nwas no doubt a repetition of many fine days in the centuries preceding\r\nit, for it is always fine in Cambridge on Sunday. And Sunday after\r\nSunday the undergraduate has received a lesson in dignities, as he\r\ncircled becapped and begowned on the cobbled paths round the greater\r\nluminaries becapped and begowned tranquilly stepping on the college\r\ngrass. The modern undergraduate does not remember a time when a pathway\r\nran across the turf from corner to corner of the college courts, as it\r\ndid in Clare Hall, in the old court of Corpus, and in William of\r\nWykeham’s foundation at Oxford. On “scarlet days” the courts are still\r\nmore gay, for the doctors then appear in their scarlet.[373]\r\n\r\nThe gowns in the court clothe the learned and the unlearned, and make a\r\npresent of as brave an academic appearance to the rowdiest of\r\nnon-readers as to the future senior wrangler. The academic year is\r\ndivided into 3 terms of 8 or 9 weeks each: half the year only is\r\ntherefore passed at Cambridge. For serious study the intervals are too\r\nlong and the ‘long vacation term’ has become the reading man’s term _par\r\nexcellence_; all the colleges are then half full, the numbers being\r\nswelled by the medical students. The multiplication of extra-collegiate\r\nscholarships has not told all one way. Parents who used to make\r\nsacrifices to send a son to the university now count upon a scholarship,\r\nwith the result that on the principle of ‘light come light go’ less use\r\nis made of opportunities. The university authorities look to the\r\n“advanced students” (of whom there are now 60 or 70 in residence) who\r\nare staying up for research work or come from other universities, for\r\nsolid academic achievement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Class from which the academic population has been drawn.]\r\n\r\nThere is no more interesting enquiry connected with our subject than\r\nthat concerning the classes from which the academic population has been\r\nrecruited at different epochs, and the careers for which the university\r\nhas fitted its members.\r\n\r\nThe Church has always remained the most constant client of academic\r\nadvantages: it was the churchmen who on the decline of the monasteries\r\nand when the universities were established as learned corporations,\r\nexchanged the cloister for the college education. The dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries and the breach with Rome left the universities as the only\r\nrepresentatives of the faculty of theology; and during the last century,\r\nespecially, if a man were destined for the Church he went--_ipso\r\nfacto_--to Cambridge or Oxford even though he were the only member of\r\nhis family to do so. In the xv as in the xvi centuries it was chiefly\r\nmen destined for the faculties of theology and law who frequented the\r\nuniversities, and then, as always in their history, the poorest scholar\r\nlived side by side with the youth of family and influence.\r\n\r\nThe lawyers, perhaps, have gone in equal proportions to a university or\r\nto one of the Inns of Court; many have gone to both. The great change to\r\nbe observed is as regards students of the third faculty, medicine. In\r\nthe xix century the doctor and the tradesman’s son did not go to a\r\nuniversity; but this century, as we have seen, has already been marked\r\nby the enormous accession of medical students at Cambridge. The gradual\r\ngrowth of a powerful middle class resulted in the later xvi century in\r\nfilling the universities with the sons not only of the older yeomanry of\r\nour shires but of the new Merchant Adventurers, often themselves men of\r\ngentle blood and coat armour. It is perhaps from this century that the\r\nidea began to prevail that an academic education was the proper\r\neducation of a gentleman. Of this century it was true as it had been\r\ntrue of no other that “the civil life of all English gentlemen” is begun\r\nat Oxford or Cambridge. Statesmen and ministers, the political and the\r\ndiplomatic careers, were recruited at the universities, and\r\nuniversity-trained canonists and lawyers like Cranmer and More, and\r\nchurchmen like Wolsey and Gardiner were chosen to be the ambassadors and\r\nsecretaries of state. Ascham complains to Cranmer that sons of rich men\r\n“who sought only superficial knowledge” and “to qualify themselves for\r\nsome place in the State” overran the university, and both universities\r\nsoon became, in Macaulay’s words, the training ground not only of all\r\nthe eminent clergy, lawyers, physicians, poets, and orators, but of a\r\nlarge proportion of the “nobility and opulent gentry” of the country.\r\n\r\nIn England men belonging to what have, hitherto, been the governing\r\nclasses have always sought advantages which would doubtless be less\r\napparent in countries where nobility and gentry are synonyms and where\r\ngovernment is not carried on by means of two such institutions as the\r\nHouse of Commons and the House of Lords. A _noblesse_ which gives no\r\nscions to the professions or to a representative chamber has seldom\r\nsought academic distinction. The man destined for parliament for the\r\ndiplomatic service and the government office--occupations which an acute\r\nAmerican observer has said are chosen by Englishmen as the business of\r\ntheir lives “without studying any other profession”[374]--prepared\r\nhimself in no other way than by three or four years spent at the\r\nuniversity, with or without graduating there. It was not however till\r\nthe nineteenth century opened that the distinctively aristocratic trend\r\nof a university was defined. Throughout that century the university was\r\n_par excellence_ the seminary of the English gentleman, and the parson.\r\nA few bankers’ sons might be put into their fathers’ counting houses, a\r\nfew government officials might place their sons at an early age in a\r\ngovernment office, but the exception only proved the rule.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Examples.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: xvi c.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: xvii c.]\r\n\r\nLet us look at some examples of the class from which Cambridge was\r\nrecruited through the xvi and xvii centuries. Hugh Latimer (_b._ 1491)\r\nwas the son of a yeoman farmer; Sir Thomas Wyatt (_b._ 1503) was the son\r\nof a knight. The father of Matthew Parker (_b._ 1504) was a Norwich\r\nmerchant; Bacon (_b._ 1561) and his brother, fellow-commoners of\r\nTrinity, were sons of the Lord Keeper and nephews of Burleigh. Fletcher\r\n(_b._ 1579) the dramatist, was the son of the Bishop of London, and his\r\ncousins the poets were sons of Elizabeth’s Master of the Requests and\r\nambassador to Russia.[375] In the xvii century Herrick the poet (_b._\r\n1591) was the son of a goldsmith established in London; Waller (_b._\r\n1605) a nephew of Hampden’s, a man of large private fortune; Cowley\r\n(_b._ 1618) was\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNIVERSITY BOAT-HOUSES ON THE CAM--SUNSET\r\n\r\nThis view is taken near Stourbridge Common and the bend of the river\r\nknown as Barnwell Pool, looking towards the town.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: xviii c.]\r\n\r\nson to a city grocer; Marvell (_b._ 1620) son to a Yorkshire clergyman;\r\nwhile Temple was the son of an Irish Master of the Rolls. In the latter\r\nhalf of the xvii century we still hear of “the farmer’s son newly come\r\nfrom the university”[376]--Bentley was one of them--and at the same time\r\nwe hear that Tuckney, Whichcote’s tutor, “had many persons of rank and\r\nquality” under him at Emmanuel College. In the xviii century, Pepys’\r\n(_b._ 1703) father was a tailor, the Wordsworths were sons of a north\r\ncountry attorney, Sir William Browne (_b._ 1692) was the son of a\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recruiting schools.]\r\n\r\nMen of low origin were sent up, and have always been sent up, to the\r\nuniversities through the beneficence of patrons, and the poor tailor\r\nStow was enabled to write his history owing to the patronage of\r\nArchbishop Parker who sent him to Oxford. Through the xv and early xvi\r\ncenturies the monastic and other convent schools supplied university\r\nstudents. Bale (_b._ 1495) had been educated by the Norwich Carmelites,\r\nCoverdale (_b._ 1487) had been an Austinfriar at Cambridge. At the\r\npresent day the big grammar schools, and in especial the Norwich grammar\r\nschool which educated Nelson, send every year a contingent of students,\r\nas they have done since the reign of Edward VI. If we take the sporting\r\nrepresentatives sent from the two universities the year before last, 23\r\nfrom Oxford and 21 from Cambridge, we shall find that one third of the\r\nCambridge men hailed from the greater public schools, Eton,\r\nCharterhouse, and Rugby.[377] Our colonies are also a recruiting ground,\r\nand with them Cambridge is favourite university.[378]\r\n\r\nThe number of undergraduates entered this academic year (1906-7) was the\r\nlargest on record, totalling 1021. The reputation and the popularity of\r\ncolleges of course wax and wane: for the past two years the largest\r\nnumber of entries (excluding Trinity) has been for Caius and Pembroke,\r\nEmmanuel coming next, and then S. John’s.[379] The number of\r\nnon-collegiate students is steadily increasing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religion at Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nThere are no ‘high Church’ centres among the colleges, and there is no\r\n‘broad Church’ movement among the undergraduates. The ‘broad Church’\r\nmovement is among the younger dons and in connexion with the University\r\nSettlement. There are nonconformists in every college, but the reunion\r\nwith Christendom which begins at home finds no advocates among other\r\nuniversity men. As usual there is at Cambridge no particular ‘school’ of\r\nreligious thought. There is however just now a decided religious\r\nmovement among the undergraduates, almost exclusively connected with the\r\n‘high Church’ parish of S. Giles. The majority of the men make little\r\nreligious profession, but there is no violent reaction such as agitated\r\nOxford in the ‘forties’ and ‘fifties,’ and the yearly increasing number\r\nof scientific students inclines to a pantheistic rather than a\r\nmaterialistic standpoint.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cambridge politics.]\r\n\r\nThe undergraduate population is decidedly conservative, as the\r\nuniversity has always been. At the present moment both sides of the\r\nfiscal controversy are represented, the distinguished Cambridge\r\neconomist Dr. Cunningham advocating tariff reform, while the Professor\r\nof Political Economy is a free-trader.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The university settlement in Camberwell.]\r\n\r\nThe “slumming” movement made an early appeal to the younger members of\r\nthe university. Their present work in south London was begun over twenty\r\nyears ago, and “Cambridge House” has existed for ten years in a district\r\nwhich has been called “the largest area of unbroken poverty in any\r\nEuropean city.” The workers are all laymen, 11 out of the 17 colleges\r\nbeing represented by resident Cambridge men, while an undergraduate\r\nsecretary in every college assists in furthering the movement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Married dons.]\r\n\r\nWe saw at the beginning of this chapter that the aspect of the\r\nuniversity had changed with the marriage of fellows, tutors, and\r\nofficials; and in time this factor must greatly modify the conditions of\r\nlife at our universities. Both of these are now overrun with children’s\r\nschools, and there can be little doubt that all the boys (and many of\r\nthe girls) will go to college. The natural profession for many of these,\r\nowing to the father’s influence with his college and the son’s inherited\r\ninclinations, will be academic. It would certainly not be to the\r\nadvantage of our seats of learning if they became in this sense close\r\ncorporations. It is obvious that this would mean less movement of ideas\r\nand less opportunity for the outside world to affect the university; and\r\nif a large number not only of the teachers but of the scholars belonged\r\nto such a caste as this, if the profession of teaching were handed down\r\nfrom father to son, the situation would not be unlike that which\r\nthreatened Europe when Gregory VII. interposed and made the Christian\r\nworld his executor in enforcing clerical celibacy. A new tuitional field\r\nwould be open to the young graduate in the numerous schools of Cambridge\r\nand Oxford, but this would only accentuate the vicious circle of an\r\neducation which might come to suggest the ecclesiastical seminary rather\r\nthan the English university. Perhaps, too, a young man loses more than\r\nhalf the social and worldly advantages of a college life if when\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DITTON CORNER, ON THE CAM\r\n\r\nFrom this spot the boat races are viewed. Behind the elms is the village\r\nof Ditton, and the building we see is Ditton Church.]\r\n\r\nhe “goes up to the university” he does not change his habitat.\r\n\r\nThe married fellow cannot begin life again elsewhere after the 5 or 10\r\nyears’ teaching at his college which used to precede his departure for a\r\nbenefice: the old bachelor, if he stayed on, no longer taught, and new\r\nmen took his place in the lecture room. But now a fellow cannot renounce\r\nthe lecture room, for he and his family cannot live on the fellowship.\r\nLecturers are therefore often men past the prime of life, and moreover\r\nmen who no longer live in daily contact with the undergraduate. New\r\nblood comes in seldom, and percolates slowly. On the other hand valuable\r\nmen stay who would under the old system have left. The influx of the\r\n“monstrous regiment” will not however, one hopes, diminish an advantage\r\nat present possessed by the seniors at our centres of learning--a\r\ngeneral equality of fortune which frees university society from the\r\nlaborious vulgarity that travails the soul elsewhere, from the general\r\n“ponderousness,” as someone has called it, of English life. At least\r\nGray’s advice to Wharton not to bring his wife to Cambridge would now be\r\nquite out of place; the “few” women are no longer “squeezy and formal,\r\nlittle skilled in amusing themselves or other people,” and the men are\r\nno longer “not over agreeable neither.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY MEN AND NATIONAL MOVEMENTS\r\n\r\n     Men who owe nothing to a university--40 great Englishmen--Cambridge\r\n     men: the scientists, the poets, the dramatists, other literary men,\r\n     the philosophers, the churchmen, lawyers and physicians, the\r\n     statesmen.

(pp. 291-309.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat part is played by a university in the life of a people? This can\r\nonly be gauged by its output of men, its influence on great movements,\r\nthe trend and character of the learning it fosters and the opinions it\r\nencourages.\r\n\r\nDuring the centuries in which the English universities have existed, the\r\nfirst degree of excellence has been reached in every department of human\r\nknowledge and activity by men whom no university can claim. Shakespeare,\r\nBunyan, Hawkins, Raleigh, Drake, the Hoods, Howard of Effingham, Clive,\r\nWarren Hastings, Marlborough, Nelson, Wellington, Scott, Dickens, Keats,\r\nBrowning, were at no university; the same is true of Smollett,\r\nRichardson, and Sheridan. It is noticeable, nevertheless, that the\r\nliterary names cited include none but poets and novelists. Among\r\nscientific men and philosophers, Bishop Butler, Faraday, J. S. Mill,\r\nHuxley, Lubbock (Lord Avebury), Spencer, G. H. Lewes, Buckle, and Grote\r\nwere not trained at universities--even among the great educationalists,\r\nthe founders of colleges in our universities and of great public\r\nschools, few received an academic education. Some careers, again, are\r\nentirely outside the sphere of university influence--admirals and great\r\ncaptains, sailors and soldiers, do not go to universities, and among\r\ninventors hardly one hails from a seat of learning. Art, also, is not\r\nfostered by an academic atmosphere; painters, architects, and musicians\r\nowe nothing to it; and although universities adorn themselves with\r\nprofessorships of the fine arts, and of music, it is not to them that\r\nwe go for definitions of art, or for an output of artists. In Orlando\r\nGibbons, indeed, Cambridge possessed a native musician whose\r\ncompositions and unrivalled technique as an organist place him in the\r\nfirst rank of musical Englishmen; but while nearly every English artist\r\nowes something to a _wanderjahr_ in Italy, scarcely one ever resided at\r\na university.\r\n\r\nNevertheless if we were to take a short list of representative\r\nEnglishmen, of the men who have influenced and shaped the national life,\r\nits religion, its politics, its thoughts, who have helped to realise the\r\nEnglish genius and to make England what it is, we should find that a\r\nlarge proportion of those who could have been educated at Cambridge or\r\nOxford were in fact university men. In the following list those who have\r\nhad a preponderant influence on English education from the vii century\r\nonwards, are included:--\r\n\r\n  vii-viii c. Bede.†\r\n       vii c.

Two were at both Paris and Oxford, and one was at Paris.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, however, our concern is with the great men produced by\r\nthe one university. There are two fields in which Cambridge is and\r\nalways has been _facile princeps_. She has nurtured all the great\r\nscientists, and all the great poets. The discoveries of world-wide\r\nimportance have been the work of Cambridge men--such were the three\r\nwhich revolutionised the science of the world, the laws of the\r\ncirculation of the blood, of gravitation, of evolution. From Bacon the\r\nfounder of experimental philosophy to Darwin and Kelvin, every great\r\nname is a Cambridge name, if we except indeed the few who like Wallace,\r\nHumphry Davy, Faraday, and the elder Herschell owe nothing to a\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Literature.]\r\n\r\nIf the scientific pre-eminence of Cambridge is unquestioned, her\r\npoetical pre-eminence is no less absolute. Chaucer, Spenser, Marlowe,\r\nMilton, Dryden, Gray, Wordsworth, Byron, Tennyson called her mother. In\r\nthe long list of English poets every poet of first rank (excluding\r\nShakespeare and Keats who were at no university) was at Cambridge,\r\nexcept Shelley who was expelled from Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe dramatist movement from Marlowe to Shirley is one of the most\r\nimportant in our literature. Here for the first time in English history\r\na group of Englishmen set themselves, on leaving the university, to earn\r\nan independence by literature--and the opportunity offered them was\r\nwriting for the players. The dramatists were, with but few exceptions of\r\nwhich the greatest is Shakespeare himself, university men; and of these\r\nall who were epoch-marking hail from Cambridge. The list is headed by\r\nthe first English tragic poet, Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare’s great\r\npredecessor; and Ben Jonson the greatest of his younger contemporaries\r\nwas also a Cambridge man. Lyly who created the art tradition of English\r\ncomedy, went to Cambridge from Oxford and there graduated _M.A._ Lodge\r\nafter leaving Oxford went to Avignon, took his _M.D._ degree there, and\r\non returning to England went to Cambridge. Shirley, the last of the\r\ndramatists, went from Oxford to Cambridge.[385]\r\n\r\nThe sonneteers had preceded the dramatists, and the first writer of an\r\nEnglish sonnet was another Cambridge man, Sir Thomas Wyatt.[386] Surrey\r\nwhose university, if he went to one, was certainly Cambridge, wrote the\r\nfirst blank verse. The first English essayist was Bacon, and he takes\r\nhis place in literature by another tide, because he was the first to\r\nadapt our language as the vehicle for a scientific literature. Of the\r\nfive men who in the great days of the flowering of English poesy wrote\r\nabout the art of verse Spenser, Webbe, Harvey, Sidney, and Puttenham,\r\nthe first three, whose contribution is also the most important, were\r\nCambridge men.\r\n\r\nAll literary initiative, indeed, between the xiv and xviii centuries\r\nappears to have come from the one university; the epoch-making\r\nrepresentatives of our literature, that is, were Cambridge men: Chaucer,\r\nSpenser, Marlowe and Ben Jonson (in defect of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FITZWILLIAM MUSEUM--EVENING\r\n\r\nIn the distance are seen the square tower of the Pitt Press and Pembroke\r\nCollege. Behind the trees are Peterhouse and the Congregational\r\nChurch.]\r\n\r\nShakespeare), Bacon, Milton, Dryden.[389] The first history of English\r\nliterature also comes from the hand of a Cantabrigian, John Bale. There\r\nare two other classes of English literature to which reference must be\r\nmade. The novelists as we have already seen have not been _alumni_ of\r\nour universities, partly because this is a field in which women have\r\nattained the highest rank, partly because there seems to be that\r\nsomething more of the artistic afflatus in the novelist’s craft and that\r\nsomething less of the academic, as compared with the other forms of\r\nliterature, which we should à priori have certainly predicated of poetry\r\nalso. A list of the novelists, from Mrs. Afra Behn to George Meredith\r\nwould however show how different is the case of the novelists to that of\r\nthe poets.\r\n\r\nThe last branch of literature, the importance of which is much greater\r\nthan its literary merit, is journalism. Here, too, Cambridge led the\r\nway, though here, as elsewhere, it has not maintained its position. It\r\nwas Roger Le Strange who as sole licenser and authorised printer and\r\npublisher of news, printed the first number of the “London\r\nGazette”;[390] and Andrew\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1658-78.]\r\n\r\nMarvell’s newsletters to his constituents at Hull were among the\r\nearliest attempts at parliamentary reporting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The learned professions.]\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to philosophy, we find that Cambridge has been singularly\r\npoor in metaphysicians, logicians, and political philosophers.\r\nEdinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Oxford all precede her. Among eminent\r\nrepresentatives of the learned faculties Cambridge had, with the\r\nexception of Segrave, Bateman, and Beaufort, no great churchmen in the\r\nxiv century. In the xvth it can boast that it nurtured Thomas Langton,*\r\nFox,* Rotherham,* Alcock,* Tunstall, and Fisher.* In the next century\r\nCambridge has it all its own way, the succession of primates is hers,\r\nand nearly every one of the prelates who took the leading parts in that\r\nbusy century were Cambridge _alumni_: Fox,* Gardiner,* Latimer,*\r\nRidley,* Cranmer,* Parker,* Grindal,* Whitgift,* Bancroft.[391] In the\r\nxvii century Andrewes,* Cosin,* Williams* the opponent of Laud, Taylor,\r\nStillingfleet, and the primates Bancroft, Sancroft, Tillotson, Tenison,\r\nrepresented the university.\r\n\r\nCambridge has also contributed her large share of the lawyers, lords\r\nchancellors and chief justices of England, from Thorpe, Cavendish and\r\nBeaufort in the reigns of Edward III. and his successors to Booth,\r\nRotherham, Alcock, Fox, Ruthall, Goodrich, Wriothesley, Gardiner, Heath,\r\nCoke, the two Bacons, Williams, Guilford and Lyndhurst in later times.\r\nThe great physicians, Caius, “Butler of Cambridge,” Gilbert, Harvey,\r\nWharton, Sydenham,[392] Paris, Grew, Sir William Browne and Sir Samuel\r\nGarth, were all Cambridge men, and illustrate the early history of\r\nmedicine from the xvi century to the xixth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Statesmen and diplomatists.]\r\n\r\nThe roll of Cambridge statesmen is not less distinguished: the two\r\nCecils, Walsingham, Boyle ‘the great earl’ of Cork, of whom Cromwell\r\nsaid that had there been one like him in every province it would have\r\nbeen impossible for the Irish to raise a rebellion; Cromwell himself,\r\nSir W. Temple, Halifax, Walpole, Chesterfield, Pitt, Castlereagh,\r\nWilberforce, Stratford de Redcliffe, Palmerston.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: National movements.]\r\n\r\nThe first great national movement in which the groups of scholars and\r\nteachers settled at Cambridge and Oxford could have taken part was the\r\nconflict with King John under the leadership of Stephen Langton, and the\r\nBarons’ war led by Simon de Montfort. Cambridge clerks were implicated\r\nin the former, for as soon as Henry III. came to the throne he ordered\r\nthe expulsion of all those excommunicate scholars who had joined Louis\r\nthe Dauphin, the Barons’ candidate for the throne of England; and it is\r\nsurmised that Hugh de Balsham\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wars of the Roses.]\r\n\r\nlater in the century favoured the side on which Simon de Montfort\r\nfought. It was at Cambridge too that the Dauphin held his council after\r\nthe demise of John. Much had happened at the university between this\r\nstruggle in the xiii century and the latter part of the\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1378-1381.]\r\n\r\nxivth when the peasants’ revolt again raised the standard of rebellion.\r\nThe university was no longer a mere aggregate of poor scholars and\r\nunendowed teachers, it had long grown into a privileged corporation\r\npossessing fine buildings and a full treasury. As such, peasant and\r\nburgess bore to it no good will, and Wat Tyler’s riots were seized as\r\nthe opportunity to burn the university charters, ransack the colleges,\r\nand mishandle the masters and scholars. At the neighbouring manor-house\r\nof Mildenhall (which had formed part of the historic dowry of Queen Emma\r\nthe mother of the Confessor) Prior John of Cambridge who was acting at\r\nthe time as abbot of Bury-St.-Edmund’s, was murdered by the mob. In 1381\r\nBuckingham, after dispersing the revolted peasantry in Essex, held ‘oyer\r\nand terminer’ at Cambridge, and the town was among the few which was\r\nexempted from the general pardon.\r\n\r\nThrough the next great national crisis Cambridge was Lancastrian. The\r\nmen of letters of this party, its poets and historians, were Cambridge\r\nmen, members of Cambridge colleges--Warkworth, Skelton, the Pastons. The\r\nLancastrian sympathies of the university dated indeed from the time of\r\n“the good duke” and of John of Gaunt, both of whom befriended it and\r\nbecame patrons of one of its important colleges; and the intimate\r\nconnexion with the House of Beaufort, which began when Cardinal Beaufort\r\nstudied at Peterhouse,[393] culminated when Lady Margaret Beaufort, the\r\nmother of Henry VII., crowned by her singular benefactions the\r\nsympathies of the university for the House of Lancaster. Edward IV. had\r\nnot loved Cambridge, had indeed robbed Henry VI.’s college of its\r\nrevenues; but it was there that the royal houses laid down the sword to\r\njoin in a work of scholarly peace, and few episodes in the annals of a\r\nuniversity are more interesting than the building of Queens’ College by\r\nMargaret of Anjou and Elizabeth Woodville, and the labours of Lady\r\nMargaret in whose son were at length reconciled the rival claims of York\r\nand Lancaster.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The colonisation of the new world.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that a Washington lies buried in the ancient chapel of the\r\nfirst Cambridge college, and we are to see further on that the impulse\r\nwhich set the “Mayflower” on her course proceeded from a Cantabrigian.\r\nThe oldest of the ‘pilgrim fathers’ was a Peterhouse man, persecuted in\r\nEngland for his ‘Brownist’ opinions. There were many university men\r\namong the first settlers, but they were chiefly from the one university;\r\nand ‘Cambridge’ was the name which rose to their lips when they\r\nchristened the town in the great state of Massachusetts where they first\r\nset foot. Thomas Hooker, one of the founders of Connecticut, was a\r\nCambridge graduate and exercised great influence among the New England\r\nsettlers. John Eliot, “the Indian apostle,” had graduated at Cambridge\r\nin 1622; and Harvard, the ‘Cambridge’ of the new world, was founded by\r\nanother of her sons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Parliament and the Stuarts.]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had America been colonised by these exiles for their faith\r\nthan the English revolution brought about the changes which would have\r\nkept them in this country. Both universities declared for the king. The\r\nloyalty of Oxford is a household word, and it certainly was not\r\ndiminished by the fact that Charles had his headquarters in the\r\nuniversity town: but Cambridge loyalty was not less; the university\r\nplate was sent to Charles at York in\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1642-4.]\r\n\r\n1642, and among the chests which reached Oxford there were some which\r\narrived safely at the colleges and never arrived anywhere else.[394] The\r\nroyalist poet was a Cambridge man with a Devonshire cure, Robert\r\nHerrick. Cambridge also supplied ‘the first cavalier poet’ John\r\nCleveland, who lost his fellowship for the king, Abraham Cowley, ejected\r\nin the same way\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1643.]\r\n\r\nby the Puritans, and yet another poet and yet another fellow in Richard\r\nCrashaw, a royalist born in the year that Shakespeare died, who on\r\nrefusing to sign the Covenant retired to Paris where he was employed on\r\nroyalist business by the exiled queen. Isaac Barrow, too, whose father\r\nlost everything for the royal cause, and had been with Charles at Oxford\r\nwhen Isaac went up to Trinity, refused the Covenant; and lived to find\r\nhimself in an increasing solitude amidst the growing Puritanism of the\r\nuniversity. A royalist\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1645.]\r\n\r\nsermon preached by Brownrigg (Bishop of Exeter) deprived him of the\r\nMastership of S. Catherine’s, and Queens’ College was entirely\r\ndepopulated by the Parliament men.\r\n\r\nBut contemporary with Herrick and Crashaw there were Cambridge men still\r\nmore famous, and they espoused the parliamentary cause. Chief of these\r\nwas the Cambridge poet on the parliament side, John Milton. Both\r\nuniversities suffered severely from the Roundheads, yet together they\r\ncontributed the chief actors against the king. From Cambridge came\r\nCromwell, Milton, and Hutchinson, from Oxford Ireton, Hampden, and Pym.\r\nAnti-monarchical and Puritan opinions were, however, only grafted on the\r\nuniversity as a result of the violent measures and the wholesale\r\nejectments carried out by Cromwell and his agents.[395]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1657.]\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the xvii century Cambridge had become Puritan, though\r\nhere she was outstripped by Oxford which had been Puritan fifty years\r\nearlier, before Elizabeth died. Among the “regicides” many were\r\nuniversity men; Andrew Marvell and the young Dryden at Cambridge were\r\nfriends to Oliver: but the Presbyterian Wallis, a member of Emmanuel\r\nCollege and later one of the founders of the Royal Society, protested\r\nagainst the king’s death warrant which met with the approval of such men\r\nas Milton, Hampden, and Hutchinson.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The university and James II.]\r\n\r\nThe Restoration was welcomed at both universities. The scheme to secure\r\na Protestant succession and the attempt to exclude James now agitated\r\nmen’s minds. The ‘bill of exclusion’ was condemned both at Oxford and\r\nCambridge; and the earlier Rye House plot was met at the latter by the\r\ndeposition of Monmouth at that time chancellor of the university. To the\r\nloyal addresses sent by both Cambridge and Oxford on the coronation of\r\nJames II., Cambridge added a condemnation of the attempt to alter the\r\nsuccession. The attitude of the bench of bishops was not less\r\nemphatic--only two prelates could be found to sign the invitation to\r\nWilliam of Orange.[396] It was with these facts before him that James\r\nset to work to affront a loyal clergy and the two loyal seats of\r\nlearning; and thus gave to each a rare occasion of proving their\r\nquality. The king first attempted to force the hand of the universities,\r\nand began by ordering Cambridge to confer the _M.A._ degree on a\r\nCatholic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1687.]\r\n\r\nThis was refused. The vice-chancellor, and with him eight fellows (one\r\nof whom was Isaac Newton) was cited to appear at Westminster before the\r\nHigh Commission. Oxford was much more harshly treated, and there is\r\nnothing in the history of either university to surpass the splendid\r\nresistance of Magdalen College to tyranny, during which it was twice\r\ndepleted of its\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1688.]\r\n\r\nfellows. The Declaration of Indulgence, however admirable in itself,\r\nstruck a blow at constitutional principles, and introduced the dangerous\r\ncorollary that he who could loose _motu proprio_ could also bind. The\r\nloyal archbishop of Canterbury, a graduate of Emmanuel, with six other\r\nprelates refused to publish the Indulgence, and were sent to the Tower.\r\nLloyd of S. Asaph, Lake of Chichester, Turner of Ely, and White of\r\nPeterborough were Cantabrigians; Ken of Bath and Wells and Trelawney of\r\nBristol, Oxonians.[397] Perhaps never since the primacy of Stephen\r\nLangton had the Church in England been so popular, or shown itself so\r\nready to slough the servilism which attends on state Churches.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1689.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nonjurors.]\r\n\r\nIn the following year five of the seven staunch prelates who had\r\nwithstood James, refused to take the oath of fealty to William and Mary.\r\nThe primate, with Turner, Lake, White, and Ken, to whom were joined\r\nLloyd of Norwich[398] and Frampton of Gloucester, headed some 400 of\r\nthe clergy as ‘Nonjurors.’ Under Bancroft the non-juring clergy\r\nestablished a schism in the English Church which lasted till the xix\r\ncentury. The Cambridge Sherlock had at first the greatest influence\r\namong them, but neither he nor Ken followed them in the subsequent\r\nschism. If another Cambridge man, Jeremy Collier, was the ablest of the\r\nnonjurors, Dodwell, a Dublin man, and professor of Ancient History at\r\nOxford, was the most erudite.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The House of Hanover.]\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we have seen, the two bishops who signed the invitation to\r\nWilliam were Oxford men, Oxford had no love for the ‘Roman-nosed\r\nDutchman,’ and William had no love for Oxford. Halifax, William’s\r\nhenchman, and Nottingham, the leaders of the party which placed William\r\nand Mary on the throne, hailed respectively from Cambridge and Oxford:\r\nbut it was the favour with which Cambridge greeted the accession of the\r\nnew sovereigns that became the seed of its whiggery. During the reign of\r\nAnne, nevertheless, an anti-Hanoverian spirit spread among the younger\r\nmen. Not only were there Jacobites\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1702-14.]\r\n\r\namong the undergraduates and the junior dons, but a political party was\r\nforming which represented the permanent elements in Toryism when\r\nseparated from Jacobitism. Amongst this party high churchmanship also\r\nfound refuge. The non-juring clergy still left at the university lived\r\nthere in close retirement, and helped to swell the ranks neither of the\r\nnascent\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1714.]\r\n\r\nJacobitism nor the new high churchism. A new\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1715.]\r\n\r\nvice-chancellor, favourable to the House of Hanover, followed a Jacobite\r\npredecessor just in time to present a loyal address to George I. on his\r\naccession. This was rewarded by the splendid gift of Bishop Moore’s\r\nlibrary; while at Oxford, where the Jacobites were more noisy and had\r\njust made the anniversary of the Pretender’s birthday the occasion for a\r\ndisturbance, two Jacobite officers were placed under arrest, and a troop\r\nof horse was quartered in the city. These events gave rise to the\r\nfollowing couplets:\r\n\r\n  (Oxford)  The King observing with judicious eyes,\r\n            The state of both his Universities,\r\n            To one he sends a regiment; for why?\r\n            That _learned_ body wanted _loyalty_.\r\n            To th’ other books he gave, as well discerning\r\n        How much that _loyal_ body wanted _learning_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  (Sir Wm. Browne\r\n  for Cambridge)\r\n\r\n            The King to Oxford sent his troop of horse:\r\n          For Tories own no _argument_ but _force_.\r\n          With equal care to Cambridge books he sent:\r\n          For Whigs allow no _force_ but _argument_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Modern politics.]\r\n\r\nWhen we come to modern politics, the parts are played on the political\r\nstage at Westminster.\r\n\r\nIn the radical matter of parliamentary reform, the first step was made\r\nby one of Cambridge’s great sons, the younger Pitt, fifty years before a\r\nWhig ministry led by Earl Grey, another Cantabrigian, laid the Reform\r\nBill on the table of the House. The claims of America to self government\r\nand freedom from taxation were upheld by both the Pitts, by Fox and by\r\nBurke, and opposed by Samuel Johnson. The Whigs, as we know, were, as a\r\nwhole, of Johnson’s mind in the matter.\r\n\r\nCambridge opposed the Manchester school of Liberalism--and Catholic\r\nemancipation, Free-trade, Reform bills, and Home Rule for Ireland were\r\nall measures which received no support from the Whig-Conservative\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nPhilanthropy seems to be as far removed from the academic purview as art\r\nor practical politics: none of the great humanitarian movements which\r\ndignified the xix century took their rise in Cambridge; but Clarkson and\r\nWilberforce were Cambridge men, and Grey\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1807-34.]\r\n\r\nabolished slavery itself in 1834.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious movements. The Lollards.]\r\n\r\nIn the century succeeding that which saw the historical birth of our two\r\nnational universities, the first breath of the early renascence was\r\nwafted to our shores: but that dual aspect of the later movement which\r\nhaunted and shaped its whole course in England had been presaged in a\r\nremarkable way, and in Wyclif Oxford gave a forerunner of the religious\r\nrenascence a hundred years before the advent of the humanistic. Even\r\nwhen Henry IV. ascended the throne, Ralph Spalding, a Carmelite friar,\r\nwas the only person of note at Cambridge\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1401.]\r\n\r\nsuspected of Lollardry; and when Archbishop Arundel set himself to crush\r\nWyclif’s movement at the two universities, the Cambridge harvest was of\r\nthe poorest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Reformation.]\r\n\r\nBut with the blaze of the renascence the reform movement passed from\r\nOxford to Cambridge. Great national movements, as we have seen, are\r\nseldom the consequence of an opinion of the Schools. The struggles of\r\nthe barons, the parliamentary wars, the restoration, the revolution\r\nwhich placed William and Mary on the throne, were not prepared in any\r\nuniversity. But there is one exception--and the prime part in that\r\nreawakening of the human mind which issued in the English Reformation,\r\nmust be assigned to the university of Cambridge. Here was laid the\r\nintellectual and historical basis of the reformed religion, and\r\nCambridge produced the men and the minds which created the\r\necclesiastical order, the liturgy, and the service books deemed suitable\r\nto the reformed faith. The stones of Cambridge are indeed a monument to\r\nthe academic and intellectual form of Protestantism, as the cathedral at\r\nOrvieto is a monument to the crudest form of eucharistic doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe end of the xv century found Cambridge very happily situated. It met\r\nthe dawn of the religious awakening with a galaxy of men representing\r\nthe noblest spirit of the time: Fisher, Fox, Thomas Langton, Alcock,\r\nRotherham, even Lady Margaret herself and Erasmus, belonged to Cambridge\r\nin a sense which did not apply to Colet and More at Oxford. They\r\nconstitute a group of Cambridge ‘reformers before the Reformation’ who\r\nwere eager patrons of the New Learning; and the epoch was marked there\r\nby the rise of important college foundations. As a result, the\r\nuniversity benefited to an extraordinary degree by gifts of religious\r\nlands made not by the hand of the despoiler but by the friends of the\r\nold faith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNIVERSITY CHURCH OF GREAT ST. MARY\r\n\r\nThe original church dates back at least to the thirteenth century and\r\nwas partially rebuilt in 1351. The present edifice is Perpendicular\r\nGothic, and was begun in 1478 and not completely finished until 1608. It\r\nis the largest Parish Church in Cambridge, and the University sermons\r\nare preached in it.]\r\n\r\nPeterhouse had itself been one of the earliest known instances of the\r\nconversion of religious property to secular purposes;[399] but in the xv\r\nand early xvi century the instances crowd upon us. Henry VI. bestowed on\r\nKing’s College and on God’s House land from the alienated priories;\r\nAlcock obtained from the Pope the dissolution of the Benedictine nunnery\r\nwhich he converted into Jesus College; Lady Margaret endowed Christ’s\r\nCollege with abbey lands; her stepson the Bishop of Ely dissolved the\r\nCanons’ House of S. John’s bestowing its property upon the new S. John’s\r\nCollege; and Mary gave monastic property to Trinity.\r\n\r\nBut the hopes raised in England by the spirit of catholic reform were\r\ndefeated: and it is again to Cambridge that we must look for the next\r\ngroup of men in the march of events--Tyndale, Cranmer, and Latimer all\r\ndrew their inspiration from Cambridge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The divorce of Catherine.]\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the movement for reform was the question of the\r\ndivorce, and Cranmer, less scrupulous than Wolsey, was the first to\r\nsuggest a legal solution in the king’s favour. The Church and the\r\nuniversities were invited to emit a (favourable) judgment on the point;\r\nand as a result of the tactics to this end the junior leaders at Oxford\r\npronounced in its favour, while the opinion elicited from Cambridge\r\nreally left the matter where it was before. The university declared that\r\nHenry’s marriage with his brother’s wife was illegal if the previous\r\nunion had been consummated, but no answer was given to the second\r\nquestion--whether the pope possessed the dispensing power. This was no\r\nanswer at all, and undermined neither the king’s position nor the\r\npope’s.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lutheranism.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the Austinfriars, a Lutheran movement had sprung up. Here,\r\nas elsewhere, the community to which Luther himself belonged led the way\r\nin the Protestant revolt. Barnes, the Augustinian prior, was the centre\r\nof a group of reformers who met at the White Horse inn; and Miles\r\nCoverdale, one of his friars, learnt his reforming principles at the\r\nCambridge friary. The meetings at the White Horse were to have\r\nconsequences which affected the other university. Clerke Cox and\r\nTaverner were to form part of the little group of Cambridge scholars who\r\ntook possession, at Wolsey’s bidding, of Cardinal College, and to\r\nprovoke the cry of the warden of Wykeham’s house: “We were clear without\r\nblot or suspicion till they came!” The famous “Oxford Brethren” were the\r\nCambridge nucleus of the Reform in the sister city.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The English bible and service books.]\r\n\r\nThe travail of the times, indeed, passed through a series of men who\r\ncame from the one university--the laboratory of the Reformation was at\r\nCambridge. The English Bible comes from\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1524-68.]\r\n\r\nits hands: Tyndale was the earliest worker, and Coverdale produced the\r\nfirst complete English bible in 1535-6. “Cranmer’s bible” appeared in\r\n1540; “Matthew’s” bible (1537) was the work of the Cambridge martyr John\r\nRogers who had also assisted Tyndale. Amongst the latter’s assistants\r\nhad been Roy, a Cambridge Franciscan, and Scory, a Cambridge\r\nDominican.[400] The “Bishop’s bible” was published under the auspices of\r\nthe Cambridge primate, Parker; and other scholars associated in the work\r\nof translation were Clerke and Dillingham of Christ’s, Layfield,\r\nHarison, and Dakins of Trinity, Sir Thomas Smith, and Bishops Andrewes\r\nand Heath.[401] Erasmus’ New Testament had appeared under the auspices\r\nof Warham, and of three Cambridge men, Fisher, Fox, and Tunstall.[402]\r\n\r\nThe service books owe as much to the one university: it is the\r\n‘Cambridge mind’ which sets its seal on these formularies. The Cambridge\r\nscholars were the best prepared men: Cranmer knew more about liturgies\r\nthan any one among the reformers; no one but Andrewes was the equal of\r\nthe catholic divines in patristic knowledge. The prayer book as it\r\nstands is in the main Cranmer’s work; Cox and Grindal were on the\r\nWindsor Commission which compiled the Communion service in the first\r\nPrayer-book of 1549. Nine years later Elizabeth entrusted the revision\r\nof Edward VI.’s 1552 Prayer-book to Parker, and Cox and Sir Thomas Smith\r\nwere among the revisers. In the final revision of 1660 Cosin rendered\r\ngreat services; and even when the still-born attempt was made to revise\r\nthe liturgy in the reign of William and Mary, the task was once more\r\nassigned to Cambridge men, Tenison, and Patrick who was set to mutilate\r\nthe collects.\r\n\r\nThe Articles of Religion in their original form and number were the work\r\nof Cranmer, their reduction to Thirty-nine was the work of another\r\nCambridge primate, Parker.[403] Whitgift drew up for Elizabeth the\r\nfamous “Lambeth Articles”; and when the vexed subject of the Athanasian\r\ncreed agitated the ecclesiastical commission of 1689 as it is agitating\r\nthe national Church now--then, as now, when Cambridge heads of houses,\r\nprofessors of divinity, and deans and tutors of colleges have signed a\r\ndeclaration in favour of its excision from the public services, two\r\nCambridge men protested--the one against its retention, the other\r\nagainst its unqualified damnatory clauses.[404] Dryden had already made\r\na similar protest.\r\n\r\nLong however before the reformers had a free hand, Burleigh in his\r\nretirement in Lincolnshire had jotted down the names of the eight\r\nlearned men most fit to carry out the Reform and to settle its\r\nformularies when a Protestant queen should succeed. Seven of these men\r\nhailed from Cambridge.[405]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cambridge martyrs.]\r\n\r\nIt was not only in what concerned scholarship that the travail of the\r\nReformation belonged to Cambridge. It gave, in the person of Fisher, the\r\nonly member of the episcopal bench who died for denying the royal\r\nsupremacy. Early in the reign of Henry VIII. the first group of\r\nCambridge Lutherans gave other martyrs: Bilney, like Barnes, had carried\r\nhis faggot and recanted Lutheran opinions before Wolsey, but afterwards\r\ntook new courage and went to the stake for them. The cause left\r\nsmouldering by the death of Barnes, Bilney, and George Stafford (a\r\nfellow of Pembroke) was rekindled by Latimer. Henry himself had examined\r\nanother Cambridge reformer, John Nicholson (“Lambert”) who denied the\r\ncorporal presence in the eucharist, and that royal and rigid\r\nsacramentarian had condemned him. “Pleasant Taylor” “making himself\r\nmerry with the stake” was another Cantabrigian.[406] The first man to\r\ndie for his faith when Mary’s reign opened was Rogers of Pembroke[407];\r\nand “the hardiest” of the Marian Martyrs was another Cambridge man,\r\nBradford. As she had nurtured the only martyr-bishop on the Catholic\r\nside, so Cambridge nurtured the Protestant group of prelates who died at\r\nthe stake: Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer are three Cambridge martyrs\r\nwhose only title to be known as “the Oxford martyrs” is that Oxford\r\nburnt them. It must not be forgotten, also, that one of the fifteen\r\nheroic London Carthusians, martyred at Tyburn in 1535, was William Exmew\r\nof Christ’s.\r\n\r\nThe death of Fisher, chancellor of the university, was followed by a\r\nwholesale ejection of the professors of the ancient learning, and the\r\nman who died for his denial of that ‘anglican solecism’ the royal\r\nsupremacy was immediately succeeded by the man who first suggested it to\r\nHenry--Thomas Cromwell.[408]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Puritan.]\r\n\r\nThe next religious movement in the country was the Puritan, against\r\nwhich we know that Elizabeth fought as lustily as Henry had combated\r\nLutheranism. Despite the fact that there were Puritan nuclei, as there\r\nhad earlier been Lutheran nuclei, at Cambridge, Puritanism was\r\neventually imposed on the university only by the same violent means as\r\nhad banished the old religion--wholesale ejections. The Anglican heads\r\nof colleges were turned out, under Oliver, to be replaced by Puritan\r\nMasters, in precisely the same way as Thomas Cromwell had replaced the\r\nCatholics by men who accepted the royal supremacy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Presbyterianism.]\r\n\r\nOne of these early nuclei of Puritanism was fomented by Thomas\r\nCartwright, and Thomas Aldrich, Master of Corpus, became the leader of\r\nthe Cambridge Puritans. Cartwright was one of the first Presbyterians,\r\nand canvassed the English counties in the interest of that form of\r\nChurch government. The movement was checked by Elizabeth, and\r\nCartwright was driven from his professorship. Later on the Puritan\r\nTuckney was Regius professor of Divinity as Cartwright had been Margaret\r\nProfessor. Presbyterianism was not congenial to the university: Hall\r\nBishop of Norwich, the satirist who was a contemporary of Shakespeare,\r\nand Archbishop Williams the life-long opponent of Laud, both went to the\r\nTower for protesting against the acts of the Long Parliament, and Hall\r\nthough he was a noted ‘low-churchman’ remonstrated against the proposed\r\nabolition of episcopacy. Among still more eminent Cantabrigians, Jeremy\r\nTaylor was as much opposed to its abolition as Milton favoured it: but\r\nwhen, in 1643-4, the Westminster Assembly met, Wallis the Cambridge\r\nscientist acted as its secretary, the Oxonian Selden being another of\r\nthe thirty laymen present at its deliberations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Brownists or Independents.]\r\n\r\nMilton had no liking for the Westminster Assembly; with Cromwell he\r\nsympathised with the rising Independent Congregations who took their\r\nprinciples from the Brownists of Elizabeth’s time. Of the five movements\r\nwhich were still to sweep over the face of religious England, two\r\noriginated in Cambridge. How inept the university is to the creation of\r\nsuch schools of thought, how alien to its genius such creations are, may\r\nbe gauged by the comparatively puny character of these two movements.\r\nThe Brownists and the Cambridge Platonists do not suggest a world set\r\nablaze; but though ineffective as schools both of them represented\r\nfar-reaching principles, and have left a lasting impression on\r\nAnglo-Saxon religion. It is easy to show this in the case of the\r\nBrownists: for Browne was the spiritual father of the Pilgrim Fathers,\r\nof the men who colonised a continent to obtain space to form those free\r\nChurch communities which many Englishmen regarded as the logical\r\ncompletion of the principles of the Reformation. The English refugees at\r\nAmsterdam were disciples and adherents of Robert Browne, and it was a\r\nlittle company\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1620.]\r\n\r\nof Brownists which eventually set out in two ships for the new world,\r\none of which--the “Mayflower”--reached what is now the State of\r\nMassachusetts. The Brownists were the first party of separatists from\r\nthe newly established Church in England, and the old and new worlds\r\nrecognise in them the true spiritual forbears of all Independent and\r\nCongregational Churches; whose ecclesiastical polity requires that each\r\ncongregation should suffice to itself, be complete in itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Latitudinarians.]\r\n\r\nIn the next century arose the liberal church movement of Hales,\r\nChillingworth, and Jeremy Taylor. Falkland, the great layman who\r\ninspired it, had been educated at Dublin university, but was entered for\r\nS. John’s College as early as 1621, and claimed in after life, in a\r\nletter to the then Master, to have been a member of that society. Taylor\r\nwas a Cambridge man who had removed to Oxford; Hales and Chillingworth\r\nwere both distinguished Oxford scholars. The distinction made by Taylor\r\nand Chillingworth between essential and non-essential articles of\r\nbelief was very far ahead of the theoretical and practical narrowness of\r\nthe German Protestantism around them. The problem at issue was stated by\r\nStillingfleet,[409] “fresh from the generous intellectual life of\r\nCambridge,” on the eve of the Restoration: Does there exist, in regard\r\nto Church government, any such _jus divinum_ as would prevent men, under\r\nthe stress of circumstances, learning from each other, and arriving at\r\nunity? The doctrine of _accommodation_ stated in his _Eirenicum_, though\r\nit was not in advance of the earlier speculation of Ussher,\r\nChillingworth, Taylor, and Hales, anticipated later developments of\r\ntheological speculation with which we are all familiar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deism.]\r\n\r\nThe xvii and xviii centuries saw the rise and progress of Deism. Lord\r\nHerbert of Cherbury[410] “the father of deism” was educated at Oxford;\r\nthe great opponent of his doctrines was the Cambridge philosopher Samuel\r\nClarke. Nevertheless deism was not a university movement. Bolingbroke,\r\nMorgan, and Blount (1654-93) were at no university; Shaftesbury (b.\r\n1621) and Tindal had been at Oxford; Woolston and Anthony Collins (b.\r\n1676) had been at Cambridge; and Toland after a residence at three other\r\nuniversities, retired to Oxford. Conyers Middleton, librarian of\r\nTrinity, was another opponent of the deists. Like unitarianism, deism\r\nundoubtedly responds to a certain temper of English religious\r\nspeculation and sentiment, but apparently to no very wide-spread\r\ntemper; and the success of English deism was consummated not here but on\r\nthe continent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Evangelical movement.]\r\n\r\nThe evangelical movement is entirely associated with the names of John\r\nand Charles Wesley and Whitfield--with a group of Oxford men. There was\r\nno principle of ecclesiastical polity and none of philosophy underlying\r\nit: it was a fervent religious revival begun within the Church of\r\nEngland and ending outside it, and as such the great influence it has\r\nexerted would appear to have presented few attractions for the Cambridge\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tractarian movement, and the earlier Cambridge movement.]\r\n\r\nThe ‘Tractarian movement’ which also arose as a renewal of religious\r\nlife in the Church of England, was, like Wesleyanism, due exclusively to\r\nOxford men. A still earlier ‘High Church’ movement--a ritualistic\r\nmovement before ‘Tractarianism’--had however found its home in Cambridge\r\nunder the auspices of Andrewes, Wren, and Cosin. These three men, later\r\nbishops of Winchester, Ely, and Durham respectively, established a type\r\nof Reformed churchmanship not only more tolerant and scholarly than\r\nLaud’s but one which was more genuinely a university movement; for it\r\nwas indigenous--its patrons were all heads of Cambridge houses--and it\r\ndid not meet, as did Laud’s efforts at Oxford, with dislike and\r\nrejection at the university. Two hundred years passed before the\r\nTractarian movement at Oxford reproduced its likeness and tendered it to\r\nEnglishmen as the _vera effigies_ of the Church of England.[411] The\r\ninfluence on religion of Charles Simeon and other Cambridge men in\r\nante-Tractarian days should also be remembered; neither should it be\r\nforgotten that the liberal anti-Calvinistic churchmanship of Peter Baro\r\nand Overall was first taught by Cambridge men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The age of Elizabeth and the New Learning.]\r\n\r\nThe pre-eminence of Cambridge during the age of Elizabeth would be in\r\nitself sufficient proof of its relation to the New Learning--to the\r\nrevival of letters and of Greek, the rise of experimental science, and\r\nthe theological speculations of the century. Round Elizabeth there\r\ngathered from the first to the last days of her reign a brilliant group\r\nof men--scholars, poets, tutors, prelates, lawyers, statesmen,\r\nphilosophers, travellers, explorers. Every name we chance upon, every\r\nman who influenced the court, the letters, the science of the day, hails\r\nfrom Cambridge. The tutors of Henry VII., Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary,\r\nand Elizabeth had all been Cambridge men, and Cambridge men were\r\nappointed as their physicians and chaplains. Names like those of\r\nSkelton, Fisher, Erasmus, Croke, Tyndale, Ascham, Sir Thomas Smith, and\r\nCheke; of Spenser, Gabriel Harvey, Marlowe, and Ben Jonson; of Bacon,\r\nGilbert, Harvey and Caius, conjure up a picture of the scholarship of\r\nthe age, of the new stir in thought, letters, and learning. Let us look\r\nat two other well-defined groups of Elizabethans--the statesmen and the\r\nchurchmen. The two Cecils, Walsingham, Haddon and Fletcher (Masters of\r\nthe Requests), Bacon, Knollys, Sussex, Smith, and Mildmay were all\r\nCambridge men; and so were all Elizabeth’s great prelates: Lancelot\r\nAndrewes, her chaplain, and dean of Westminster, and the primates\r\nParker, Grindal, and Whitgift: and they represented every party in the\r\ncountry. Fulke Greville the most fortunate of the Queen’s favourites,\r\nSir John Harrington her godson, and Essex, were also Cambridge men.\r\nAmong the gallant little company of the first adventurers one only is\r\nknown to have studied at a university, and he was at Cambridge: Sir\r\nThomas Gresham conducted the expedition fitted out by Raleigh which\r\nresulted in the discovery of Virginia--named after the virgin queen--and\r\nin the introduction of the tobacco leaf. Cavendish, a Corpus man,\r\nbrought to England the tobacco called after him. Clifford, third earl of\r\nCumberland, a Trinity man, was one of the early privateers and\r\nnavigators; and young Roger Manners, of Queens’ and Corpus, went the\r\n“Islands Voyage” with Robert Devereux who had studied at Trinity. Even\r\nDrake, who was at no university, is known as a Cambridge benefactor, and\r\nwas as we have seen a large subscriber to the chapel of Corpus Christi\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nIn the last place the New Learning of the Tudor age was carried from\r\nCambridge to the sister university. It was so well understood that\r\nCambridge represented this new learning that Wolsey went there for the\r\nmen who, by colonising Cardinal College, were to introduce it at\r\nOxford; and Fox of Pembroke founded a belated _Corpus Christi College_\r\nwith the express purpose of erecting a monument in Oxford to the\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The schoolmasters.]\r\n\r\nThe last half of the xv century brought with it the great schoolmasters.\r\nMulcaster of Eton and King’s was master of Merchant-Taylors’ on its\r\nfoundation; Colet’s school, S. Paul’s, sent to Cambridge for its second\r\nhead, and five of its first eight head masters were Cambridge and King’s\r\nmen. King’s College has supplied a large proportion of the Provosts and\r\nhead masters of Eton, many of the famous masters of Harrow, and a King’s\r\nman counts as the creator of Rugby “as it now is.” Ascham’s\r\n“Schoolmaster” was epoch-making, and his connexion with his university\r\nwas much closer than William Lily’s with Oxford.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Royal Society A.D. 1660-62.]\r\n\r\nThe brilliant epoch of Elizabeth spent, intellectual life smouldered\r\nduring the reigns of the first two Stuarts and the Protectorate, to be\r\nrenewed and rekindled not by fresh literary activity but by the\r\ninquisitive temper which invaded the nation as it emerged, with the\r\nRestoration, from civil conflict and the slough of doctrinal wrangling.\r\nThis inquisitiveness took shape in the institution of the Royal Society.\r\nThe _foyer_ of the Royal Society was London, although some of its most\r\ndistinguished members migrated later with Wilkins to Oxford. Of the\r\neminent men who formed the first Royal Society Wallis, Wilkins, Foster,\r\nJonathan Goddard, Sir William Ball, Lawrence Rooke, Sir William Petty,\r\nWard the mathematician, Ray, Woodward the mineralogist, Flamsteed,\r\nSloane, Boyle, Halley, Chief-Justice Hale, Lord Keeper Guilford, with\r\nSprat the Bishop of Rochester (its historian), Cowley and Dryden (its\r\npoets), and Sir Robert Moray--Wallis, Foster, Rooke, Ray, Woodward,\r\nFlamsteed, Guilford, Cowley, and Dryden, were Cantabrigians. Four of the\r\nmost prominent, Ward, Boyle, Sloane and Ball, were at no university;\r\nGoddard went from Oxford to Cambridge where he graduated; Petty though\r\nhe became Professor of Anatomy at Oxford was educated at foreign\r\nuniversities; Moray was at S. Andrews and Paris; Wilkins, Halley, Hale,\r\nand Sprat were at Oxford. Among the first fellows there came from Oxford\r\nChristopher Wren, John Evelyn, Hook of the microscope, Sydenham: More\r\nthe Platonist, Sir William Temple, Willughby the ornithologist, and\r\nGrew, came from Cambridge. Two more of Charles’s courtiers joined Moray,\r\nKenelm Digby from Oxford, and Villiers Duke of Buckingham from\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cambridge Platonists.]\r\n\r\nThe next movement in English thought was both religious and\r\nphilosophical. When Latitudinarianism ceased to be ecclesiastical it\r\npassed from Oxford and became identified with the sister\r\nuniversity.[412] Here it was handled by a group of men, from the two\r\ncolleges Emmanuel and Christ’s, so as to embrace a moral and political\r\nphilosophy, to which the term _Platonist_ is only aptly ascribed if it\r\nbe meant to stand for the “mass of transcendental thought”; that\r\ntraditional Platonism of the speculative schools which had succeeded one\r\nanother down the centuries, always at war with nominalism and constantly\r\nasserting the transcendent character of moral ideas and the reality of\r\nfree will. Hobbism came to assail this position; for Hobbes applied\r\nBacon’s method to the moral and social order, and found the basis for\r\nthem in certain obvious facts of human nature. The spirit of enquiry set\r\nafoot by the Cambridge Platonists was none the less real because it was\r\nopposed to such tenets. They set themselves, in fact, to enquire whether\r\nauthority and tradition should guide men in matters of faith. They\r\nasserted that reason was supreme, and they sought to place Christianity\r\nagain--to place Protestantism for the first time--under the protection\r\nof that noble spiritual idealism which the great thinkers of the early\r\nChurch had chosen for the new faith; to penetrate Christianity with\r\nphilosophy.[413]\r\n\r\nThe early Latitudinarianism was merely an essay in liberal\r\necclesiastical polity. The new movement was something more, something\r\nfiner. Cambridge now gathered up the floating philosophical speculation\r\nwhich existed in the xvii century side by side with the intense\r\nabsorption in dogmatic wranglings, the rapid growth of sects--of\r\nAnabaptists, Antinomians, anti-Trinitarians, Arians. “A kind of moral\r\ndivinity,” as Whichcote’s tutor, the Puritan Tuckney, cried out in\r\nalarm, was to be substituted for theological polemic. The movement\r\nindeed was due to the combination of a higher spirituality than the\r\nPuritan with the new spirit of bold enquiry in moral and speculative\r\nfields[414]--it constituted a Cambridge reaction against the trammels of\r\nPuritanism. It was the first of all English religious movements (not\r\nexcepting Wycliffism) to ally a growth of the religious sentiment with\r\nthe demand for a wide and liberal theoretical basis to theology. At the\r\nhead of this theological movement stands Benjamin Whichcote (_b._ 1609)\r\ntutor of Emmanuel, who numbered among his pupils Wallis, Smith, and\r\nCulverwell, and who was afterwards Provost of King’s. Ralph Cudworth\r\n(_b._ in Somersetshire 1617) is perhaps the central figure: he is great\r\nas a moral philosopher, great in his impartial statement of an\r\nopponent’s case, great even in his freedom from the party and political\r\nheat which consumed his contemporaries.[415] In John Smith (_b._ 1616)\r\nof Emmanuel[416] the movement becomes more speculative, his was the\r\nfinest and most richly stored mind, and his “Select Discourses” perhaps\r\nmark the culminating point of the Cambridge school. There remains Henry\r\nMore (_b._ 1614) the better known name, of Christ’s College, the\r\nexponent of Descartes, the ardent follower of Plato, from whom he learnt\r\n“that something better and higher than the knowledge of human things\r\nconstitutes the supreme happiness of man.” His _Enchiridion ethicum_ and\r\n_Enchiridion metaphysicum_ were the text books of the school.\r\n\r\nThis academic group forms, as Tulloch points out, not only “one of the\r\nmost characteristic groups in the history of religious and philosophical\r\nthought in England,” but one of the most homogeneous. Whichcote’s\r\naphorism “There is nothing more unnatural to religion than contentions\r\nabout it” sums an epoch in religious thought. Questions of Church order\r\nand Church policy were left aside, to philosophise; the clash of\r\necclesiastical parties ceased to trouble, and an academic enquiry into\r\nthe relation of philosophy to religion takes its place. Neither Puritan\r\nnor Presbyterian had brought any such liberating attitude towards\r\ntheology, for which indeed the early Protestantism cared not one jot,\r\nbut which has never entirely died out of England since the speculations\r\nof the Cambridge Platonists.[417] The Englishman--fed with the crude\r\ndogmatism of Luther, the arid ecclesiasticism of Laud, the dull fancy of\r\nthe Puritan, and the intolerance of all three--now for the first time\r\nwas called dispassionately to consider the claims of the philosophical\r\nreason, the eternal distinction between essential and non-essential--a\r\ndistinction anathema to the ordinary Protestant--fundamental and\r\nnon-fundamental, between the reality and the figure; to the claims, in\r\nfine, of those ontological verities on which belief in the revealed\r\nverities ultimately depends. A “rational Christian eclecticism” was for\r\nthe first time presented to Protestants, and in so far anticipated the\r\nprinciple upon which the problems of the present day attend for\r\nsolution. The values to be assigned to the notions of “orthodoxy,” of\r\ndogma--who around them had ever thought of such things before! At Oxford\r\nit has always been a question of form, of Church order; but at Cambridge\r\na question of substance, an enquiry into the criteria of truth, the\r\ncredentials of theories.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Cambridge Platonists were ineffective. Their\r\nphilosophy lacked a touchstone, concentration; and they allied its fate\r\nto a ridiculous bibliology. For More, who taught at the university which\r\ngave us our school of biblical critics--Erasmus, Colenso, Westcott,\r\nLightfoot, Hort--the wisdom of the Hebrew had been transmitted to\r\nPythagoras, and from Pythagoras to Plato, who thus becomes the heir of\r\ndivine (the Hebrew) philosophy. Such a doctrine was a serious\r\nembarrassment to a cause in the age of Hobbes; it meant that the\r\nrational and critical _criteria_ of the day went unutilised, and no\r\ndoctrine can withstand such a charge. There was, too, a certain lack of\r\nthe spirit of adventure, that gallant spirit which is not out of place\r\neven in philosophy, and of the courage which belongs to enthusiasm. The\r\nappeal to reason made by Hooker had debouched as Latitudinarianism; Laud\r\nand George Herbert had both opposed it; but Puritan England was stronger\r\nthan both and would have none of either. The Platonists stood between\r\nthem--called upon the Laudian to modify his conception of authority,\r\nupon the Puritan to admit the claims of reason, enriched Latitudinism\r\nwith a philosophy. They were not listened to. None the less the _via\r\nmedia_ they offered has penetrated English thought. The Englishman\r\nfavours reason but is no Hobbist, he must have his God behind the\r\nmachine; he likes the supremacy of reason with a nebulous Plato behind\r\nit--not the real Plato, but a Plato to hurl as a weapon in the face of\r\nthe materialist, without understanding too much about it. The ‘Cambridge\r\nmind’ hit on a middle term, a resting place for speculation and for\r\nfaith, which suits the Englishman in the long run better than either\r\nLaud or Hobbes. In Cudworth we have that mind typified--that union of\r\ntoleration with half lights which triumphs in England. Very bold\r\nspeculation is not the Englishman’s _forte_. His intellect in such\r\n_gesta_ is not clear-cut, and his practical sense is always compatible\r\nwith unturned-out-corners of mysticism, prejudices, reverences false and\r\ntrue--all the haziness made by those useful half lights loved by a\r\npeople who do not like to be mystified, but do not wish to be too much\r\nenlightened.\r\n\r\nAnd if we ask why Cambridge should be Platonist, the answer is because\r\nit always resisted the Aristotelianism of the Schools. Reaction against\r\nscholasticism had brought Plato to Florence in the xv century, it made\r\nPlato at home in Cambridge in the xviith. We have called Cambridge the\r\nlaboratory of the Reformation; there too, we see, was made the first\r\nattempt to reconcile Protestantism with philosophy: in undoing the\r\nservitude of the latter to religion, which had been the mark of the\r\nmiddle ages, the Cambridge Platonists did away with medievalism, joined\r\nhands, behind its back, with that Neo-Platonism of the Alexandrine\r\nschools which had influenced the early Church, defied, of course,\r\nscholasticism, and prepared the place for our modern moral sciences\r\ntripos.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Modern science.]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that Cambridge is the representative in England of\r\nthe scientific movement which has changed the face of the modern world.\r\nIt may perhaps be pretended that the stages of its development in Europe\r\nhave been marked by the great men emanating from this one university.\r\nThe names of Bacon, Gilbert, Harvey, Flamsteed, Newton, Darwin, are\r\nsignposts of the direction which science was to take and landmarks of\r\nits achievements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADDENBROKE’S HOSPITAL IN TRUMPINGTON STREET\r\n\r\nThis building, as we now see it, was remodelled by Sir M. Digby Wyatt\r\n1864-65.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Gilbert the discoverer of terrestrial magnetism and of the\r\naffinity of magnetic and electric action, was praised by Galileo, while\r\nErasmus called him “great to a degree which is enviable.” Flamsteed\r\nbegan that series of observations which initiated modern astronomy,\r\nHorrox came still earlier, and they have been followed by such\r\nCantabrigians as Newton, Nevil Maskelyne, Herschell, Airy and Adams.\r\nNewton and Darwin are two of the greatest names in the history of the\r\nphysical and physiological sciences--they stand out as creators of\r\nepochs in the march of human knowledge: on Newton’s statue in Trinity\r\nchapel are inscribed the words _qui genus humanum ingenio superavit_--of\r\nwhom else could they be spoken?--Darwin has revolutionised our thoughts\r\nin spheres far removed from those directly affected by his great\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to consider the relation of these distinguished sons to the\r\nuniversity which bred them, it is interesting to find how close this has\r\nalways been. From the first makers of Cambridge to the last, from its\r\nearliest distinguished sons to its latest, the individual’s relation to\r\nthe university has been a close one and the same names come down the\r\ncenturies and create a homogeneity in Cambridge history which has\r\ncertainly not received its due meed of recognition. A group of\r\npersons--of families--is already assembled in this remote eastern corner\r\nof England in the xiii and xiv centuries which contains the elements of\r\nour university history: Stantons, de Burghs, Walsinghams, Beauforts,\r\nClares, Greys, Pembrokes are there--and Gaunt and Mortimer the roots of\r\nLancaster and York. If we had looked in upon the town earlier still, in\r\nthe xi and xii centuries, we should have found Picot--the ancestor of\r\nthe Pigotts whose name is recorded in Abingdon Pigotts hard by--who\r\nsucceeded to the honours of Hereward the Wake[418] and who founded the\r\nchurch dedicated to the Norman saint Giles; Peverel who brought the\r\nAustin canons to Cambridge, Clare, de Burgh, Fitz-Eustace (or Dunning)\r\nand, by the side of these companions of the Conqueror, the sons of the\r\nsoil--the Frosts and Lightfoots. In the xiii century there were the\r\nDunnings assisting the Merton scholars to establish themselves, Mortimer\r\nendowing the Carmelites, the Veres[419] establishing the Dominicans, de\r\nBurghs, Walsinghams, Walpoles, and Bassetts,[420] the Greys, and\r\nManfields,[421] and “Cecil at the Castle”--all of whom appear in Edward\r\nI.’s Hundred Rolls.\r\n\r\nThe name of Clare figures on every page of the history of the\r\nPlantagenets. The first Gilbert de Clare had been employed to terrorise\r\nthe East Anglians who held out against William; another Gilbert is at\r\nthe head of the barons, his son is the guardian of Magna Charta, and\r\n_his_ granddaughter founded Clare College. She also built the Greyfriars\r\nhouse at Walsingham in 1346, was, with her kinsmen the Monthermers a\r\ngreat benefactor to the first Augustinian priory founded a hundred years\r\nearlier at Stoke Clare[422] and found time\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1248.]\r\n\r\nto send timber from her estates towards the building of the king’s Hall,\r\nas Queen Elizabeth sent a similar gift just two hundred years afterwards\r\nto the king’s college of Trinity. The Clares had received 95 lordships\r\nin Suffolk, which formed “the honour of Clare,” and they gave their name\r\nto the county in Ireland. Through Ralph de Monthermer the founders of\r\nClare and Pembroke were allied, for he was Elizabeth de Clare’s\r\nstepfather, and afterwards brother-in-law to Aymer de Valence (see\r\nTables I, II).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1198.]\r\n\r\nWe first hear of the de Burghs in 1198 when Thomas, brother to Hubert\r\nthe king’s chamberlain,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1225.]\r\n\r\nbecame guardian to a Bury ward. In 1225 a de Burgh was bishop of Ely,\r\nand a hundred years later John de Burgh the 4th earl of Connaught and\r\n2nd earl of Ulster married with Elizabeth de Clare. Towards\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1385]\r\n\r\nthe end of the xiv century another de Burgh, author of the “_Pupilla\r\noculi_” was chancellor of the university, and it is he who purchased the\r\nland of S. Margaret’s hostel in 1368.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1291.]\r\n\r\nThe connexion of the Mortimers with Cambridge also dates from the xiii\r\ncentury: Guy de Mortimer figures in the Cambridge Hundred Rolls as the\r\nbenefactor of the Carmelite friars, and sixty years later Thomas, son of\r\nSir Constantine de Mortimer, ceded land for King’s Hall.\r\n\r\nThe name of Walsingham occurs as that of a prior of Ely in 1353. The\r\nWalsinghams held two manors\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1344.]\r\n\r\nin Suffolk, besides land in Cambridge part of which was sold to the king\r\nfor the site of King’s Hall.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1290-1299.]\r\n\r\nThere was a Ralph Walpole bishop of Ely, and subsequently of Norwich in\r\nthe time of Edward I., who gave a messuage to Peterhouse as early as\r\n1290. The Walpoles continued to figure on the roll of this college till\r\nin the xvi century the Walpole of that day fled with the Jesuit Parsons\r\nto Spain after the trial of Campian; he became vice-rector at Valladolid\r\nbut was eventually martyred at York five years before the close of the\r\ncentury. Robert and Horace Walpole continued the Cambridge traditions of\r\ntheir family.\r\n\r\nWith the xiv century other names appear: the Scropes, Gonvilles,\r\nStantons,[423] the families of Cambridge and of Croyland, Haddon,[424]\r\nZouche,[425] and Cavendish, and last but not least Valence, and the\r\nhouse of Gaunt and Beaufort.\r\n\r\nThe connexion of the Scropes with Cambridge probably dates from the\r\nearlier half of the xiv century. Scropes, as we have seen, figure among\r\nthe chancellors of the university in that century, and were allied not\r\nonly to the Mortimers but to the Gonvilles: when therefore we find the\r\nrepresentative of the house of Valence who is also a grandson of Roger\r\nMortimer, and whose son married a descendant of the founder of Clare,\r\nengaged in a political intrigue with Gaunt,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1371.]\r\n\r\nScrope, and the Master of Pembroke in 1371, and the Scropes[426] Greys\r\nand Mortimers conspiring with\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1414.]\r\n\r\nRichard Earl of Cambridge[426a] early in the next century, we gain a\r\nvery definite impression of a Cambridge _coterie_.\r\n\r\n    “---- Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their dear care,\r\n    And tender preservation of our person”----\r\n\r\nare the words which Shakespeare puts into the mouth of Henry V. before\r\nhis discovery of their treachery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shakespeare and Cambridge men.]\r\n\r\nIndeed the historical plays of Shakespeare, from the dawn of our\r\nuniversity history in the reign of John to its zenith in that of Henry\r\nVIII., place prominently before us our Cambridge protagonists. In “King\r\nJohn” the names of Louis the Dauphin, Chatillon, and de Burgh recall the\r\nCambridge history of two centuries. Chatillon is here the ambassador of\r\nPhilip of France who calls upon John to surrender his “borrowed majesty”\r\ninto Prince Arthur’s hands; and in the next century Marie de Chatillon\r\nand Elizabeth de Burgh are building colleges. Sir Stephen Scrope figures\r\nin “Richard II.” In “Henry IV.” Scroop Archbishop of York and Edward\r\nMortimer, and in “Henry V.” the Earl of Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey,\r\nappear. In “Henry VI.,” with Beaufort, Mortimer, Suffolk, Somerset,\r\nBuckingham and Stafford, Stanley, Woodville, and Margaret of Anjou--all\r\nof whom were to play a part in Cambridge history--we have Bassett of the\r\nLancastrian faction, and Vernon representing the Yorkists. The _dramatis\r\npersonae_ of this play thus include the _dramatis personae_ of King’s\r\nand Queens’ Colleges, of Haddon Hall, of Magdalene, and Christ’s. In\r\n“Richard III.” Rotherham of York appears, with many others who belong to\r\nCambridge in the xv century; while in “Henry VIII.” even Dr. Butts of\r\nGonville, Henry’s physician, is not omitted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: xv c.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: xvi c.]\r\n\r\nIn the xv century we have some new names. Zouche is there still, and\r\nScrope, and Bassett, and Beaufort, but there are also Langton, Stafford,\r\nPole, Brandon, Stanley, and Babington. In the xvi century Stanley,\r\nBrandon, Stafford, Sidney, Audley, Bacon and Cecil, are all prominent\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThese various groups are not independent. The annexed pedigrees will\r\nshow us that the Clares, Mortimers, de Burghs, Audleys, and Staffords\r\nhad intermarried: that Valence and Chatillon, Mortimer, Grey, and\r\nHastings, formed one family; that the Beauforts, through John of Gaunt,\r\njoined the house of Edward III. to the house of Tudor, and were allied\r\nto the Staffords, Nevilles, and Stanleys; that the Scropes were allied\r\nto the Mortimers, the Staffords again to the family of Chatillon and to\r\nthe Woodvilles: the Sidneys to the Brandons, the Brandons to the Greys,\r\nthe Greys to the Woodvilles;[427] and that the xvi century Audleys\r\nintermarried with the Greys as the xiv century Clares had wedded with\r\nthe Audleys; that through Mortimer, Stafford, Hastings, and Grey, the\r\nfounders--Clare, de Burgh, Chatillon, Valence, Beaufort, Stafford,\r\nWoodville, Audley, and Sidney--form one clan. Before we proceed with the\r\nlist of well-known Cambridge names from the xvi century onwards, let us\r\nnotice in passing that certain titles have always clung to Cambridge, no\r\nmatter who bore them: such are Pembroke, Huntingdon, Buckingham,\r\nSuffolk, Leicester.[428]\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I.\r\n\r\nPEDIGREE OF CLARE\r\n\r\n     Gilbert de Clare, ob. 1229   = Isabella, daughter of William Mareschall,\r\nEarl of Hertford and Gloucester,  |  Earl of Pembroke in right of his wife\r\ndescended from Richard, founder   |  Isabella de Clare, and granddaughter of\r\nof the House of Clare (whose      |  Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke,\r\n4th son was abbot of Ely) and     |  surnamed “Strongbow” (who married\r\ngreat-grandson of Richard the     |  a dau. of the Irish prince Dermot).\r\nFearless, Duke of Normandy.       |\r\nThe family settled in Wales       |\r\nin the xii c.

Babington, Bacon, Beaumont, Bryan, Cavendish, Cecil,\r\nColeridge, Darwin, Devereux, Fletcher, Greville, Harvey, Langton,\r\nLightfoot, Lytton, Manners, Montague, Neville, Newton, Palmer, Shepard,\r\nTaylor, Thackeray, Temple, Wordsworth--all form such groups, and have\r\nprovided the university not only with great names, but with a family\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nNo name has clung more steadily to Cambridge than Babington--it was\r\nknown there at least as early as the xv century, and was that of the\r\n25th abbot of Bury in the time of Henry VI. Henry Babington was\r\nvice-chancellor in 1500; Dr. Humphrey Babington built the two sets of\r\nrooms on the south side of Nevile’s court known as ‘the Babington\r\nrooms,’ in 1681, and his family have given prominent members to the\r\nuniversity ever since. One of the Bacons was the last Master of\r\nGonville, and Nicholas Bacon and his two sons were at Corpus and\r\nTrinity. Beaumont is a Peterhouse name; but in the reign of Elizabeth\r\nDr. Robert Beaumont was Master of Trinity and vice-chancellor, and a\r\nBeaumont was Master of Peterhouse\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temp. Ric. ii. 1380-1397.]\r\n\r\nin the xviii century. Towards the end of the xiv century William\r\nCavendish was fellow and master of the same college, and John Cavendish\r\nhad been chancellor in 1380. In Gray’s time Lord John Cavendish was at\r\nCambridge, in the next century Henry Cavendish the scientist; and the\r\nconnexion of this family with the university has never been severed.\r\n\r\nThe Cecils appear at Cambridge with the rise of Burleigh’s family in\r\nElizabeth’s reign, and they were connected with the Bacons a family\r\nwhich also came into prominence at the same time; the great Bacon was\r\nBurleigh’s nephew, and the Cecils were kinsmen of other celebrated\r\nCambridge men--Cheke, Hatton, Howard, and the founder of the Brownists.\r\nMoreover one of the early Cecils had been made water\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temp. Hen. viii.]\r\n\r\nbailiff of Whittlesey (‘bailiff of Whittlesey mere’) and keeper of the\r\nswans in the fen district. William, first Lord Burleigh, was born in his\r\nmother’s house at Bourn--the place which gave its name to the barony\r\nheld successively by Hereward, Picot, and Peverel. The third and fifth\r\nlords married with the Manners, the sixth with a Cavendish. Both the\r\nCecils of Elizabeth’s time were chancellors of the university;\r\nBurleigh’s eldest son Thomas Earl of Exeter and Lady Dorothy Nevill his\r\nwife gave no less than £108 a year to Clare Hall, and ‘Mr. Cecil’ was\r\nmoderator when James visited the university in 1615. Darwin had been\r\npreceded at Cambridge by old Erasmus Darwin, botanist and poet, the\r\n‘Sweet Harmonist of Flora’s court’ as Cowper calls the ancestor of the\r\nman who gave us the great harmonizing hypothesis of the century.[430]\r\nFletcher is another Cambridge name. Fletcher Bishop of London was at\r\nCorpus, so was his son the dramatist; Giles the brother of the bishop,\r\none of Elizabeth’s ambassadors, was at King’s, his two poet sons were\r\nCambridge men, and there was a scientific Fletcher at Caius in the xvi\r\ncentury. Greville or Grenville is another Cambridge name: Fulke\r\nGreville, first Lord Brooke (whose mother was a Neville) was at Jesus\r\nCollege, so was his cousin the second lord, whose father had been sent\r\nto Trinity in 1595 by Robert Devereux Earl of Essex with a letter of\r\nadvice on Cambridge studies written by another old Cantabrigian, Bacon.\r\nThe first Lord Lansdowne in the time of Charles II. and Sir Bevil\r\nGreville (ob. 1706) were both at Trinity.\r\n\r\nThe Suffolk name of Hervey is another which has always figured in\r\nCambridge--there was Hervey Dunning in the xiiith and Hervey de Stanton\r\nin the xiv century; a Harvey succeeded Gardiner and Haddon in the\r\nMastership of Trinity Hall, of which he was a considerable benefactor,\r\nand was vice-chancellor in 1560, Gabriel Harvey, a kinsman of Sir Thomas\r\nSmith’s, was a fellow of this college and of Pembroke, William Harvey\r\nwas at Caius. Langton[431] is an ancient and honoured name; it was that\r\nof the 6th Master of Pembroke, of John Langton chancellor of the\r\nuniversity in the time of Henry VI., of Thomas Bishop of Winchester, and\r\nother Cambridge men. Lightfoot is a name which was known in the fen\r\nbefore the Conquest, and was that of the eminent Cambridge Hebraist two\r\nhundred years before the Bishop of Durham studied there. The Lyttons\r\nhave been known at the university since the xvii century, Sir Rowland\r\nLytton the antiquary was a member of Sidney Sussex College[432] and\r\nBulwer Lytton was at Trinity Hall. The Montagues and Montacutes have\r\nbeen important since the day when Simon Montacute Bishop of Ely\r\nbefriended Peterhouse. Through the xvii century, the first Master of\r\nSidney Sussex, Richard Bishop of Norwich (the antiquary), the 2nd Earl\r\nof Manchester, and Charles Montague (afterwards Lord Halifax) who, with\r\nPrior, replied to Dryden’s “Hind and Panther,” were all Cambridge men;\r\nand Sir Sidney Montague of Barnwell was one of Charles I.’s Masters of\r\nthe\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1627.]\r\n\r\nRequests. We have seen how the Nevilles intermarried with the families\r\nof Cambridge founders; Henry Neville was proctor, and vice-chancellor in\r\n1560; Thomas Nevile was 8th Master of Trinity[433] and vice-chancellor,\r\nand 6th Master of Magdalene, where the name was again recorded in the\r\nlast Master of the college (Lord Braybrooke). There was a Newton at\r\nCambridge, 6th Master of Peterhouse, contemporary\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1381.]\r\n\r\nwith Beaufort, Thorpe, Scrope, and de Burgh. In the middle of the xvi\r\ncentury another Newton was vice-chancellor; fifty years later Fogg\r\nNewton was Provost of King’s and vice-chancellor in the 8th of James I.,\r\nand an Isaac Newton unknown to fame entered for Peterhouse about the\r\nsame time as the discoverer of the law of gravitation entered Trinity.\r\nPalmer is another well-known name: a John Palmer was proctor in the\r\nreign of Elizabeth, Edward Palmer was fellow of Trinity in the reign of\r\nCharles I., and Edward Palmer Professor of Arabic, the sheikh Abdullah,\r\nwas a Cambridge man. Skeltons have been found at\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1391.]\r\n\r\nthe university since a proctor of that name who flourished in the days\r\nof Richard II.; Shepards since the days of Elizabeth when there was a\r\nproctor of that name; Jeremy Taylor was kin to Rowland Taylor the\r\nCambridge martyr; and Palmerston continued the tradition of the Temples.\r\nThe Sternes had played a part in Cambridge before the days of Laurence\r\nSterne;[434] Thackeray followed other members of his family to the\r\nuniversity, and there have been Wordsworths at Cambridge ever since the\r\npoet went to S. John’s and his brother Christopher was Master of\r\nTrinity.\r\n\r\nOther Cambridge names claim attention. There had been Latimers and\r\nRidleys at Cambridge before the Protestant martyrs. Aldrich belongs to\r\nthe xvi and xvii centuries. Byngham was not first heard of when the\r\nparson of S. John Zachary built God’s House, but is the name of no less\r\na personage than the first Master of Pembroke (Thomas Byngham), and\r\nanother William Byngham was proctor\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1570.]\r\n\r\nin the year when Whitgift was vice-chancellor. One of the Bassetts was\r\nproctor as late as 1488, and Roger Ascham’s father in the xvi century\r\nwas steward to the great Yorkshire house of Scrope; Mildmay, the founder\r\nof Emmanuel, was brother-in-law to Sir Francis Walsingham, and was\r\nallied to the Ratcliffes.[435] There were Days before the Days of\r\nKing’s; the Harringtons--allied to the Montagues, Stanleys and\r\nSidneys--were Cambridge men; a Hatton was proctor in 1499 and later\r\nProvost of King’s, and the Hattons of the time of Elizabeth and her\r\nsuccessors--who intermarried with the Montagues--were all benefactors of\r\nJesus College.[436] The northern Percies have often taken part in\r\nCambridge affairs, and Percy Bishop of\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1451.]\r\n\r\nCarlisle was chancellor of the university in the time of Henry VI. Roger\r\nRotherham was Master of King’s Hall before the days of the great\r\nchancellor. There were Somersets at Cambridge from the days of Henry\r\nVI., and a Stafford was proctor the year Henry VIII. beheaded\r\n\r\n   ---- bounteous Buckingham\r\n    The mirror of all courtesey.\r\n\r\nStokys and Stokes was a well-known name before Sir George Stokes went to\r\nPembroke; Sedgwick was on the papist side in the controversy held before\r\nEdward VI.’s commissioners; Tyndale, like Aldrich, belongs to the xvi\r\nand xvii centuries. Fitzhugh is a name which flourished at the\r\nuniversity in the xv and early xvi centuries. Parker, Paston,[437]\r\nMorgan, Cosin and Cousins, and the various forms of Clark are constant\r\nCambridge names. In modern times Macaulay, Trevelyan, Paget, Maitland,\r\nand Lyttelton should be added.\r\n\r\nThe subject of university men must not be dismissed without noticing how\r\nmany of the most distinguished Cantabrigians never earned a degree. We\r\nhave already seen (in chapter iii.) that in some periods of greatest\r\nintellectual achievement the examination tests at the university were\r\nwholly inadequate: what follows is a list of great and prominent men who\r\ntook no degree at all:--Bacon, Byron, Macaulay (fellow of Trinity), Gray\r\n(professor of history),[438] Morland the hydrostatician,[439] Woodward\r\nthe founder of mineralogy,[440] Donne, Fulke Greville, Parr the classic,\r\nSir William Temple, Cromwell, Pepys and Mildmay both of whom were\r\nconspicuous benefactors of the university, Dryden who received his\r\ndegree by dispensation of the Primate, Stratford de Redcliffe who was\r\ncreated _M.A._ by royal mandamus, Palmerston who graduated “by right of\r\nbirth.” There was no one so important as Macaulay in 1822 when his name\r\nwas absent from the tripos list, no one so great as Darwin in the tripos\r\nlists of 1831 when he took an ordinary degree.\r\n\r\nThe Oxford roll of non-graduates is not less distinguished: Sir Thomas\r\nMore, Sir Matthew Hale, Sir Christopher Hatton, Sir Philip Sidney,\r\nWolsey, Massinger and Beaumont the dramatists, Shaftesbury, Gibbon,\r\nShelley--while Halley the astronomer took his _M.A._ by royal mandamus,\r\nand Locke’s degree was irregular. Dublin university has not a dissimilar\r\ntale to tell; Burke failed to distinguish himself there, and Swift was\r\ngiven a degree _speciali gratia._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nGIRTON AND NEWNHAM\r\n\r\n     Etheldreda of Ely and Hild of Whitby connect the school of York\r\n     with the monastery of Ely--English women and education--the four\r\n     “noble and devoute countesses” and two queens at Cambridge--the\r\n     rise of the movement for university education--two separate\r\n     movements--Girton--Newnham--rise of the university lecture\r\n     movement--Anne Clough--the Newnham Halls and Newnham College--the\r\n     first triposes--the “Graces” of 1881--social life at the women’s\r\n     colleges--character and choice of work among women--the\r\n     degree--status of women’s colleges at Cambridge and Oxford--and\r\n     status elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the women’s colleges is of sufficient importance to\r\ncall for a chapter in any history of the university, even if they did\r\nnot in themselves awaken so much general interest. Cambridge cannot be\r\notherwise than proud of its position as pioneer university in the higher\r\neducation of the women of the country; the women’s colleges count as one\r\nof its glories and stand to it in the relation which Spenser gave to the\r\nriver Ouse:\r\n\r\n    My mother Cambridge, whom as with a crowne\r\n    He doth adorne, and is adorn’d of it.\r\n\r\nThey belong to its atmosphere of vitality and growth, their presence\r\nadds something to that air of newness and renewal which has never been\r\nabsent from the university town.\r\n\r\nEtheldreda of Ely and Hild of Whitby were of the same blood, kin to\r\nEdwin and Oswy. They founded two of those famous double monasteries for\r\nwomen and men, one of which became the greatest school in England, the\r\nother the nursing mother of the university of Cambridge.[441] The\r\nhistories of the School of York and of the School which was to rise on\r\nthe banks of the Granta had therefore been linked together since the vii\r\ncentury by Hild and Etheldreda. Was any prevision vouchsafed to Hild,\r\nthat mother of scholars, of the day just twelve hundred years later when\r\ntwo women’s colleges were to rise by the side of the great school in the\r\ndiocese of Ely? The centre of learning which had Etheldreda of Ely for\r\none of its patrons was certainly propitious to women; but Cambridge had\r\nanother patroness--whose name was among the earliest to be invoked in\r\nthe town after the coming of the Normans--that Rhadegund who ruled the\r\nfirst nuns and the first double monastery in France, who was ordained a\r\ndeacon by S. Médard, in whose convent study came next to prayer, who\r\nlectured each day to her spiritual children, and whose learning is\r\nrecorded with admiration by one of her monks, the poet-bishop Venantius\r\nFortunatus.[442]\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no country with a long history where women have played\r\na smaller part on the national stage than England. But a conspicuous\r\nexception must be made--in education they have played a great part, and\r\nthis part was nowhere greater than in Cambridge. We have the little\r\ngroup of college builders who lived in contiguous centuries--Elizabeth\r\nde Clare, Marie de Saint-Paul, Margaret of Anjou, and Margaret of\r\nRichmond--to prove it: but the activity of the xiv and xv centuries was\r\nequally apparent between the viith and xth. It was Saxon nuns who\r\ncarried learning to Germany, and the rôle of the great abbesses in those\r\ncenturies, while it must be reckoned among the exceptions to the\r\ninconspicuous part played by women in English history, also served\r\nprominently the cause of education.[443]\r\n\r\nThe “two noble and devoute countesses” who built Clare and Pembroke, and\r\nwhom Margaret of Anjou desired to imitate, realised perhaps more than\r\nanyone else in the xiv century the extraordinary joy of launching those\r\nfirst foundations with their promise for the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT BRIDGE--BRIDGE ST.\r\n\r\nThis view is painted from the old Quay side. The water-gate of Magdalene\r\nCollege is seen on the right, and in the distance is the Tower in the\r\nNew Court of St. John’s College rising above the tree-tops.]\r\n\r\nfuture:[444] but it was something of this joy which was reserved for\r\ntheir descendants who saw the rise of Newnham and Girton. It was,\r\nindeed, not to two but to four noble and devoute countesses[445] that\r\nCambridge owed its most efficient co-operation in the great periods\r\nwhich mark its history--the dawn of the renascence in the xiv, the\r\nthreshold of our modern life in the xv, and the consolidation of the\r\nreligious movement in the xvi century:[446] and if Queens’ College was\r\nbuilt by Margaret of Anjou “to laud and honneure of sexe femenine”\r\nCambridge has repaid her by extending the significance of her ambition.\r\n\r\nThe women’s colleges which we now see did not, then, begin the connexion\r\nof women and the university, they completed it. It is a curious thing\r\nwhen one looks down a list of Cambridge benefactors to find that from a\r\ncollege to a common room fire, from a professorship to a Cambridge\r\n“chest,” from the chapel to a new college to the buttress of a falling\r\ncollege, from a university preacher to a belfry,[447] the names of women\r\nnever fail to appear as benefactors, but appear in no other way. Not\r\nonce until the xix century did any woman benefit from the learning\r\nwhich her sex had done so much to inaugurate, to sustain and\r\nconsolidate.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1867 the idea of founding a woman’s college and of\r\nassociating the higher education of women with the university of\r\nCambridge began to take shape.[448] No movement of the century, it may\r\nconfidently be affirmed, has done so much to increase the happiness of\r\nwomen, and none has opened to them so many new horizons. If men look\r\nback on the years spent at the university as among the happiest in their\r\nlives, so that everything in later life which recalls their _alma\r\nmater_--not excluding the London terminus from which they always “went\r\nup”--borrows some of its glamour, the university life meant all this,\r\nand more, for women. To begin with it repaired a traditional injustice,\r\nthe absence of any standard of individual life especially for the\r\nunmarried; the neglect of every personal interest, talent, or ambition,\r\nwhich a woman might have apart from looking after her own or other\r\npeople’s children. The Reformation, in itself, had done singularly\r\nlittle for women. Puritan views were of the kind patronised by a Sir\r\nWilloughby Patterne, and no step had been made towards recognising\r\nwomen’s claims as individuals since the days when convents had in some\r\nmeasure certainly admitted these, a fact which probably sufficed to make\r\nthe convent turn the scale on the side of happiness.\r\n\r\nGirton and Newnham are the outcome of two contemporaneous but separate\r\nmovements. In 1867, as we have seen, the moral foundations were laid of\r\na college in connexion with Cambridge university where women should\r\nfollow the same curriculum and present themselves for the same\r\nexaminations as men. In 1869 the late Professor Henry Sidgwick, fellow\r\nof Trinity, and afterwards Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy,\r\nsuggested that lectures for women should be given at Cambridge in\r\nconnexion with the new Higher Local Examination which the university had\r\nthat year established for women all over England. To-day, more than\r\nthirty years after the building of the two colleges, Newnham and Girton\r\nare as alike in character as two institutions can be, but this likeness\r\nis the consequence of changes on both sides. The view taken by the\r\npromoters of Girton was that if women were to be trained at the\r\nuniversity by university men they should undergo precisely the same\r\ntests, and take precisely the same examinations as men. Professor\r\nSidgwick contented himself with a scheme for relating the higher\r\neducation of women to university teaching, and not only accepted but\r\nencouraged a separate course of study and a separate examination test.\r\nGirton represents the principle that a woman’s university education\r\nshould closely resemble that which the centuries had evolved as the best\r\nfor men. Newnham was started to further a scheme of education as unlike\r\nthe men’s as preparation for the higher work made possible. The one grew\r\nout of a claim to have the same examination as men; the other was the\r\noutcome of an examination established expressly for women. Events have\r\nnot justified the second scheme. If women’s education was to be\r\nconnected with the university, the only permanently satisfactory way\r\nwas, clearly, to follow the curriculum already traced out. If this was\r\nnot actually the best which could be devised, the foundation of women’s\r\ncolleges was not the moment to attempt to alter it. A “best” created for\r\nwomen would always have been thought to be a second best. There were in\r\nfact not one but two objects set before all who interested themselves in\r\nthese things--to get higher education for women, and to win recognition\r\nfor their capacity to do the same work as men. Among the founders of\r\nwomen’s colleges many had present to their minds something further than\r\nthe advantages of education--they looked forward to a time when women\r\nshould participate in the world’s work, and have a fair share in the\r\ncommon human life; not a fair share of its labour, for this had never\r\nbeen lacking, but of the means, the opportunities, and the recognition\r\nenjoyed by men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Women and the ordinary degree.]\r\n\r\nGirton at once prepared its students for the university Previous\r\nExamination, and claimed that they should be examined for both the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF CAMBRIDGE FROM THE CASTLE HILL\r\n\r\nThe central object in the picture is the tower of St. John’s College\r\nChapel, with the tower of Great St. Mary’s a little to the right and\r\nKing’s College Chapel to the extreme right. In the middle distance on\r\nthe left is Jesus College and the Round Church, and nearer to us we look\r\ndown upon the roofs of Magdalene College. The building on the right in\r\nforeground is St. Giles’ Church, the original foundation of which takes\r\nus back nearly to the Conquest. In the extreme distance is the rising\r\nground known as the Gog-Magog Hills.]\r\n\r\nordinary and the honour degree. Newnham at first prepared its students\r\nfor the Higher Local examinations and the triposes, discountenanced the\r\nPrevious Examination and would not allow its students to prepare for the\r\nOrdinary degree. In the event, Newnham has had to abandon the\r\nexamination which was the original _raison d’être_ of its existence, and\r\nGirton has had virtually to abandon its claim to examination for the\r\nordinary degree. This means that every woman who takes a degree takes it\r\nin honours: the same is true of no college of men in Cambridge except\r\nKing’s. The founders of Newnham considered it a waste of time for women\r\nto come to the university to qualify themselves for that Ordinary degree\r\nwhich graces the majority of our men, and which represented such a\r\nmysterious weight of learning to sisters at home in the old days. This\r\ndecision has a double _ricochet_--it is good for the colleges, for only\r\nthe better women come up; it is bad for many women who, like many men,\r\nare unfit to do tripos work and who might yet enjoy from residence at\r\nCambridge the same advantages--direct and extraneous--which the ‘poll’\r\ndegree man now obtains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Girton.]\r\n\r\nThe first committee for the future Girton College met on December 5th\r\n1867;[449] but the foundation of Girton dates from October 16, 1869\r\nwhen a hired house at Hitchin, midway between Cambridge and London, was\r\nopened to six students at a time when it was not thought advisable to\r\nplant a women’s college in Cambridge. The college at Hitchin[450] was\r\ncarried on under serious tuitional and other disadvantages--lecturers\r\nfrom the university, for example, were paid for the time occupied in the\r\njourney--and in 1873 the college was removed to Girton, a village two\r\nmiles out of Cambridge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The manor and village of Girton.]\r\n\r\nThe manor of Girton on the Huntingdon road--the old via Devana--belonged\r\nin the xi century to Picot the Norman sheriff of Cambridge who\r\nexpropriated part of its tithes for the endowment of the canons’ house\r\nand church of S. Giles which is passed by Girtonians on their way from\r\nthe college to the town. In the xvi century the manor provided a rent\r\ncharge for Corpus Christi College. Earlier still it was the site of a\r\nRoman and Anglo-Saxon burial ground (discovered in a college field in\r\n1882-6). The college itself is built on old river gravel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The founders.]\r\n\r\nThe final decision to build near but not in the university town was\r\ntaken at the last moment when Lady Augusta Stanley, wife of Dean\r\nStanley, refused both money and moral support if it were decided\r\notherwise.[451] Lady Augusta Stanley who thus determined a step which\r\nhas not proved advantageous to Girton was not, however, one of the\r\nfounders of the college. This honour is due in the first place to Madame\r\nBodichon (Barbara Leigh Smith before her marriage) and to Miss Emily\r\nDavies, daughter of Dr. Davies, rector of Gateshead, who elaborated the\r\nscheme together. The first thousand pounds which made possible the\r\nrealisation of the scheme was given by the former, whose activity in all\r\ncauses for the advancement of women’s interests was crowned by her gifts\r\nto the first women’s college: part of her capital was made over in her\r\nlife-time to Girton which became her trustee for the payment of the\r\ninterest until her death in 1891, and of certain terminable annuities\r\nafterwards.[452] The third founder was Henrietta wife of the 2nd Lord\r\nStanley of Alderley and daughter of the 13th Viscount Dillon,[453] a\r\nmunificent donor to the college, who joined the movement in 1871,\r\nbefore the removal from Hitchin, and who died in 1895.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The college.]\r\n\r\nThe picturesque and collegiate-looking building which arose in 1873 for\r\nthe accommodation of 21 students, was thus the first residential college\r\nfor women ever built in connexion with a university. It was, like\r\nPembroke, the result of a woman’s intention to found and finish a _domus\r\nseu aula scholarium_, the scholars being, for the first time, of the sex\r\nof the founder. Subsequent building in 1877, 1879, 1884, 1887 (when Jane\r\nC. Gamble’s legacy enabled the college to house 106 students) and\r\nfinally between 1899 and 1902, has greatly increased its capacity, and\r\nthe college now holds 150 students in addition to the Mistress and the\r\nresident staff. It contains a large hall, libraries, reading room,\r\nlecture rooms, a chemical laboratory, chapel, hospital, and swimming\r\nbath; and its position outside the town gives it the advantage of large\r\ngrounds, some thirty acres being divided into hockey fields, ten tennis\r\ncourts, an orchard, and kitchen garden; while a seventeen acre field,\r\npurchased with the Gamble bequest in 1886, is utilised as golf links and\r\nwoodland. Over the high table in the hall are the portraits of the three\r\nfounders; Madame Bodichon is represented painting, reminding each\r\ngeneration of students that one of their founders was a distinguished\r\nand delightful artist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIRTON COLLEGE--EVENING\r\n\r\nThese buildings were designed by Mr. Waterhouse. They are of red brick,\r\nand were first occupied in 1873.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Government.]\r\n\r\nThe college is governed by its members,[454] from whom is drawn the\r\nExecutive Committee, three members of which are indirectly chosen by the\r\nold students. The Executive Committee appoints the Mistress and college\r\nofficers, but the Mistress nominates the resident staff with the\r\nexception of the bursar, junior bursar, librarian, and registrar. The\r\nfees for residence and tuition are thirty-five guineas for each of the\r\nthree yearly terms, and they include “coaching.” Students may be in\r\nresidence who are not reading for a tripos, the goal of the great\r\nmajority. A great part of the preparation for triposes is done at the\r\ncollege by its own resident staff. The first Cambridge degree\r\nexamination taken by women was in 1870 when five of the six Hitchin\r\nstudents were examined for the Previous Examination;[455] and the first\r\ntripos examination taken by women was two years later when three of\r\nthese students passed in the classical and mathematical triposes.[456]\r\nIn scholastic successes, Girton trained the first wrangler (Miss Scott,\r\nequal to 8th wrangler 1880), the first senior moralist (Miss E. E.\r\nConstance Jones, the present Mistress of Girton), and the only senior\r\nclassic (Miss Agnata Ramsay, now wife to the Master of Trinity); and was\r\nthe first to obtain first classes in the classical tripos.[457]\r\n\r\nAmong scholarships and exhibitions are six foundation scholarships the\r\ngift of private persons; the scholarships of the Clothworkers’,\r\nDrapers’, Goldsmiths’, and Skinners’ Companies and of the Honourable the\r\nIrish Society; in addition to which there are other valuable\r\nscholarships and studentships due to private benefactors, and the\r\nGamble, Gibson, Montefiore, Metcalfe, and Agnata Butler prizes.[458]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Former Girton students.]\r\n\r\nFormer Girton students not only fill posts all over Great Britain and\r\nIreland as head or assistant mistresses in high schools, grammar\r\nschools, and women’s colleges, but they are to be found holding the\r\nprofessorship of mathematics and a classical fellowship at Bryn Mawr\r\nCollege Pennsylvania, in the high schools of Pretoria, Bloemfontein, and\r\nMoscow, in women’s colleges at Toronto and Durban, as mathematical or\r\nother tutors in Queen’s College London, Queen’s College Belfast, and\r\nAlexandra College Dublin. A Girtonian is vice-president of the British\r\nAstronomical Association, computer at Cambridge Observatory, assistant\r\ninspector to the Scotch Education Department, lecturer in modern\r\neconomic history in the university of London, a fellow of the university\r\nof London, on the staff of the Victoria History of the Counties of\r\nEngland, assistant on the staff of the English Dialect Dictionary (just\r\npublished); while one is secretary and librarian of the Royal Historical\r\nSociety, and another (a _D.Sc._ of London) is a fellow of the same\r\nsociety. Old students are also to be found as educational missionaries\r\nin Bombay and Calcutta, as members of the Missionary Settlement for\r\nUniversity Women in Bombay, and of the Women’s Mission Association\r\n(S.P.G.) at Rurki; as medical missionary at Poona, as missionaries at\r\nLake Nyasa, and in Japan, and the principal of the North India Medical\r\nSchool for Christian Women is also a Girtonian. In special work, a\r\nGirtonian is H.M.’s principal lady inspector of factories, one of H.M.’s\r\ninspectors of schools, a Poor Law guardian, a deputy superintendent of\r\nthe women clerks’ department of the Bank of England, and on the\r\nsecretarial staff of the Tariff Commission. An old Girtonian is the\r\nonly woman member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and the\r\nonly woman to hold the Hughes Gold Medal of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nAll other colleges which have been founded or will be founded for women\r\nowe a debt to Girton for upholding the principle of equal conditions and\r\nequal examination tests in the university education of women and men.\r\nIts promoters always kept steadily before them the two ends of women’s\r\neducation, and never moved from the position that “what is best for the\r\nhuman being will be found to be also the best for both sexes.” To them\r\nit is mainly due that when Plato’s ideal of equal education of the sexes\r\ncame at length to be realised, after women had waited for it more than\r\ntwo thousand years, it was not upon a basis of separate examinations for\r\nwomen, and separate tests so designed as to elude comparison.[459]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Newnham.]\r\n\r\nThe village of Newnham which is approached from the “Backs” of the\r\ncolleges, and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOATHOUSE ON ROBINSON CRUSOE’S ISLAND\r\n\r\nOn the upper river at the back of King’s Mill, not far from Queens’\r\nCollege. Across the bridge in the distance and behind the trees on the\r\nleft is Coe Fen, and on the right is Sheep’s Green.]\r\n\r\nwhich, until 1880, was also accessible by a ferry over Coe fen, played\r\nan important part in the early history of the university. It was the\r\nsite given to the Whitefriars, who had been the first arrivals in\r\nCambridge, and who from the time of their appearance there as romites\r\ntill they became the sons of S. Theresa were the most conspicuous\r\ncommunity in the town. The first general of the Carmelites--an\r\nEnglishman--had been a contemporary of the founder of the first college,\r\nand it was at Newnham that he visited his friars in the middle of the\r\nxiii century, at the convent there which is described in the Hundred\r\nRolls and the Barnwell Chartulary.[460] In the same century William de\r\nManfield left his lands in Newnham to the scholars of Merton. In the\r\nnext (the xiv) century the manor of Newnham was given to Gonville Hall\r\nby Lady Anne Scrope, and both Sir John Cambridge and Henry Tangmer, who\r\nwere aldermen of the guilds of the Blessed Virgin and Corpus Christi,\r\ngave or bequeathed lands and houses they held in Newnham to the new\r\ncollege which the\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1291.]\r\n\r\nguilds had built.[461] The Carmelites moved later to the present site\r\nof Queens’ and the adjoining ground, and the edge of their property is\r\nskirted by every Newnham student on her way to lectures either through\r\nSilver Street or King’s College. This new residence was the gift of Sir\r\nGuy de Mortimer and was in the busy university centre--Mill Street in\r\nthe parish of S. John Baptist--so that the friars still heard the sound\r\nof the horn which was blown at the King’s Mill to tell the miller at\r\nNewnham that he might begin to grind. Beyond the mill was Newnham Lane,\r\nwhich stretched to Grantchester.[462]\r\n\r\nLike Peterhouse which was adapted and built for the “Ely Scholars,” the\r\nHall at Newnham was the outcome of a students’ association:--the North\r\nof England Council for the Higher Education of Women, of which Miss\r\nClough was president, and the association formed to promote the\r\ninterests of the Higher Local students were its real progenitors.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the removal from Hitchin had been decided, it was hoped that\r\nthe students already settled in Cambridge and the Girton community might\r\nform one body; but the decision to build away from the town put a stop\r\nto any such scheme. The standpoint of the promoters of Newnham had\r\nalways diverged in some particulars from that of the promoters of\r\nGirton. The former wished to reduce the expenses of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEENS’ LANE--THE SITE OF THE OLD MILL STREET\r\n\r\nThe Towers of Queens’ College Gateway are seen on the left, through the\r\ntrees on the right is St. Catherine’s College, and in the distance a\r\nportion of King’s College.]\r\n\r\na university education to the minimum, and they wished, too, that it\r\nshould be completely undenominational, while a clause in the\r\nconstitution of Girton provided for Church of England instruction and\r\nservices. Finally, the question as to which preliminary and degree\r\nexaminations should be preferred by women was still pending.[463] But\r\nwhen the moment came to hire and build a house of residence, the\r\nadvantage was all on the side of Newnham. Work began in a hired house in\r\nthe centre of the town with five students, in the October term of\r\n1871.[464] These quarters were too noisy, and Miss Clough, who loved a\r\ngarden, found an old house set in a large garden and orchard, with the\r\nhistoric name of Merton Hall, and moved there in 1872. A supplementary\r\nhouse in Trumpington Street was taken next year, and there were then in\r\nresidence 14 students in Merton Hall, 7 in Trumpington Street, and 8 in\r\ntown lodgings. In 1875 Newnham Hall was built on one side of Coe fen and\r\nNewnham Mill, as Peterhouse had been built on the other. So that\r\nNewnham students frequented the streets of Cambridge from the first, and\r\nhad their house of residence in the town two years before the sister\r\ncommunity settled at Girton. The founders of Girton had been the first\r\nto ideate a women’s college in connexion with university teaching, but\r\nNewnham was the first college for women to take its place by the side of\r\nthe historic colleges in Cambridge.\r\n\r\nLet us now retrace our steps for a moment. In March 1868 the North of\r\nEngland Council memorialised the university to obtain advanced\r\nexaminations, and in the following year Cambridge instituted the\r\nexaminations for girls over eighteen since known as the Higher Local\r\nExamination. In the autumn of the same year (1869), as we have seen--the\r\nyear which saw the establishment of the future Girton community at\r\nHitchin--the organisation of the Cambridge lectures for women was mooted\r\nunder the auspices of Mr. Henry Sidgwick. The first meeting was convened\r\nat the house of Mrs. Fawcett, whose husband was then Professor of\r\nPolitical Economy at the university, and whose little daughter, the\r\nfuture senior wrangler, was peacefully cradled at the time in a room\r\nabove. The result of this meeting was the formation of a committee of\r\nmanagement consisting of members of the university, and of an executive\r\ncommittee, and the programme of a course of lectures was printed for the\r\nfollowing Lent term 1870.[465] The original scheme\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MERTON HALL\r\n\r\nAn old house in the Merton Estate district.]\r\n\r\nincluded a students’ house where women from a distance could be lodged.\r\nTwo students applied in the autumn term of 1870 for permission to reside\r\nin Cambridge, and were received into private houses in the town.\r\nMeanwhile in response to an appeal, originating with Mrs. Fawcett,\r\nexhibitions of £40 for two years for students attending the lectures had\r\nbeen given by John Stuart Mill and Helen Taylor, and before the year\r\nclosed it was found necessary to open a house of residence. In March\r\n1871 the post of head of a house of residence was offered to Miss Anne\r\nJ. Clough.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anne Clough.]\r\n\r\nWe know more about Miss Clough than about any founder or first principal\r\nof a college on which he or she left a personal mark. Of the life and\r\nthoughts of others, with the exception perhaps of Bateman in the xiv\r\ncentury and Fisher in the xvith, we know singularly little. Anne J.\r\nClough was born on January 20, 1820, at Liverpool. Through her Newnham\r\nreceived, what Girton missed, the impress of a strong individuality, now\r\nplaced by “great death” at a distance which enables us to focus and\r\nappraise it. Her father’s family was of Welsh origin and traced itself\r\nto that Sir Richard who was agent to the great merchant-adventurer, Sir\r\nThomas Gresham. To her Yorkshire mother, Anne Perfect, she and her\r\nbrother, the poet Arthur Hugh Clough, owed their literary interests. In\r\nappearance she was of middle height and spare--an old woman of that\r\nVictorian epoch in which she was born, out of whose eyes looked the soul\r\nof the twentieth century, and after. She seemed indeed to have two\r\npersonalities--the white hair and an uncertain gait typified the one,\r\nbut the eyes, very dark and very bright, would lift unexpectedly in the\r\nmidst of a conversation, and then the visitor would receive a\r\nrevelation; he would see no more the old woman but the woman who must\r\nalways be young, the stamp of an inexhaustible energy, that shrewdness\r\nwith an unconquerable idealism close behind, an atmosphere about her of\r\nuncouth poetry.\r\n\r\nFor she was no artist. She had not that which separates the artist from\r\nthe man of ideas, or the dreamer, or the seer--expression. No poetical\r\nimagination was ever more tongue-tied. She spoke by actions, and used\r\nwords only as indications of thoughts. Her speech was compared by a\r\nformer student to the works of early painters, before command over the\r\nmaterial had been obtained, but where “sheer force of character and\r\nfeeling had risen over the difficulties.” She was an idealist, but she\r\ncould never understand the value of an abstract principle. Her interest\r\nwas always in the individual, in the career, and she came to no matter,\r\nto no person, with a store of general principles ready for the case. She\r\nwanted to give women not merely learning, but a life of their own, to\r\ncall out interests, to satisfy their individuality. She liked to find in\r\nthem many and marked vocations, for she understood the dignity of all\r\nwork and had no disdain of common things. She wanted every one to have a\r\nplace and an office in life, and must perforce fit the squarest bits\r\ninto a round hole, so intolerably pathetic was it to her that they\r\nshould have no hole. You could not “hand her the salt or open the door\r\nfor her” without receiving “some recognition of your individuality” a\r\nstudent said of her. This recognition of the individuality of women and\r\nof the human and practical sides of higher intellectual training was her\r\ncontribution to the movement in which she took so great a part. And the\r\ncontribution was all important.\r\n\r\nShe had besides a strong belief in the value of academic advantages. It\r\nwas in order that some crumbs of things academic might fall to the\r\nteachers in elementary schools, that she arranged the summer meetings\r\nof University Extension Lecture students. Miss dough’s belief in\r\nhappiness--in people’s right to happiness--was the source of most\r\ndelightful qualities. She had waited, she said, for her own till she was\r\nfifty years old, and it had come to her with Newnham. She insisted on\r\nthe little pleasures “which bring joy by the way.” Nothing was too small\r\nto engage her own attention, and her educational qualities lay in\r\nawaking similar interest in others, as her moral disposition led her to\r\nshare and so to increase the common stock of interests and supports in\r\nlife. And so on the rare occasions when she left the college boundaries\r\nshe would recount to the students at her table or in her room all that\r\nhad interested her during her absence. She busied herself over the\r\nminutest details of their health or well-being, and finding that two\r\nstudents made a simple supper upstairs on Sunday, she arrived at the\r\ndoor carrying a good-sized table, because she had noticed there was none\r\nconvenient for the purpose. Newnham was for her a big house, and the\r\nstudents were grown-up daughters in a delightful family not yet realised\r\nelsewhere, each of whom had her own place in the world, her own personal\r\nlife, its rights and liberties. Yet the “head” who habitually intervened\r\nin small college matters (with a total lack of power of organisation,\r\nwhich in the administration of Newnham she left to others) and who was\r\nfrequently agitated and over anxious about them, balanced these things\r\nby a life-long habit of interest in large public affairs, and, what was\r\nmore strange, by a very real serenity. She did not think the individual\r\nshould be sacrificed to the college, or “to a cause, however good.” She\r\nnever lived in a small milieu--even Newnham.\r\n\r\nShe constantly exercised a simple diplomacy, not divorced from\r\nsympathy--with independent-minded students, with university dons who\r\nviewed Newnham with disfavour, and in generally vain attempts to\r\nconciliate high theory with prudent practice. It was here that her\r\ncharacteristics sometimes jarred on the early students, among whom were\r\nmany ardent spirits, people whose presence there at all was the\r\nconsequence of a struggle _à outrance_ with convention and prejudice;\r\nand who resented Miss Clough’s temporising ways, as though the first\r\nmaker of Newnham were a backslider in the matter of first principles.\r\nThey thought her indirect and timid. She was neither. She had real\r\ncourage, not only as her biographer has said “audacity in thought”[466]\r\nbut audacity in execution. She was staunch and tenacious, and might be\r\nfound taking an individual’s part against the whole college; and whether\r\nthe help she gave was moral or financial, no one ever knew of it but\r\nherself. Neither did she always prefer the most brilliant or useful\r\nstudent, but would take under her wing the apparently most\r\ninsignificant. She had no fear of the unusual, though the younger\r\nstudents thought so, and it was “her indifference to abstract principle”\r\nwhich made them sometimes judge that she despised ideals. She had also\r\na singular frankness--a singular directness--when speaking with others\r\nface to face; her important things were said at odd moments, odd moments\r\nwere her opportunities. Neither did she compromise; she went all the way\r\nround and came out at the same place. This expedient made it quite\r\nunnecessary to override obstacles, and her aphorism “my dear, you must\r\ngo round” was received with hostile scorn by a student seated on the\r\nhigh horse of abstract considerations. Indeed Miss Clough was not a\r\nfighter in the sense that she could neglect the quantity of others’\r\nfeelings: and her desire that people should not be offended was part of\r\na sympathy, not of a timidity, which could not be conquered. The working\r\nof her mind is shewn in the saying: “If we watch, we may still find a\r\nway to escape”--because to her there was no inevitable where her\r\nsympathies were engaged. Her diplomacy led her to keep her notions to\r\nherself, so that they should not be nipped in the bud by the frost of\r\nhostile criticism.\r\n\r\n“My dear, I did wrong” was the disarming reply to a very young student\r\nwho asked her “as one woman to another” whether she considered she had\r\nbeen justified in a certain course of action. Her singleness of\r\npurpose--the absence of all vanity--a complete disinterestedness, shone\r\non all occasions. Her never failing search after the right course she\r\nonce tried to express by saying to a student: “You must remember that I\r\ntry to be just but I don’t always succeed”; and she criticised the\r\nperformance with complete detachment from the personal equation.[467]\r\n\r\nAmong the ideas which seethed in her brain was the training of students\r\nas doctors to work among Hindu women; and one of the last things she\r\ninterested herself about was a school for girls at Siam. She wanted\r\nteachers trained to teach.[468] She urged students to know at least one\r\ncountry and one language besides their own. Her liking for new people,\r\nher interest in foreigners, especially in Italians, and in travel, was\r\npart of a spirit of adventure with which she was largely endowed. She\r\nliked old students to go to the colonies, and her interest in such\r\ndoings never flagged. Her hold on the xx century was foreshadowed in the\r\ninterest she took during the last years in the Norwegians, and in Japan.\r\nShe felt very special sympathy with elementary teachers who receive\r\nsmall encouragement for highly important and difficult work. Even the\r\nmonotonous life of the country clergy claimed her attention, as did a\r\nSunday class for working men inaugurated by one of the students--which\r\nshe visited, taking the keenest interest in the handwriting of the men,\r\nin the books they read. Her relations with her servants were always\r\ndelightful, and she found time in the midst of a busy life to teach the\r\nNewnham house boy to write.\r\n\r\nShe sometimes spoke at the college debates, and usually, as a student\r\nremarked, “spoke on both sides.” On college anniversaries she would make\r\nshort addresses, and point the connexion of study with\r\nlife--“examinations demand concentration, presence of mind, energy,\r\ncourage,” qualities which “come into use every day”: or she would tell\r\nstudents “to bear defeat, and to try again and again”; or she would\r\nquote the American who said we should not complain about things which\r\ncan be remedied, or which cannot be remedied; and add: “there is great\r\nstrength in these words.”\r\n\r\nHer religion was unconventional like her mind; full of aspiration, but\r\nlacking in definiteness. She spoke of it as “a longing towards what is\r\ndivine,” as “arising from the contemplation of the divine.” She spoke of\r\n“bringing our hearts into a constant spirit of earnest longing after\r\nwhat is right” and added in language which discovers the burning thought\r\nand the halting utterance that made strange partnership in her: “There\r\nis no occasion, then, of kneeling down and repeating forms to make\r\nprayers.”\r\n\r\nOne of the last acts was to preside on February 3, 1892 at a meeting\r\nwhich recommended the Council to build a college gateway; the gateway\r\nwhich was to symbolise the concentration of the work--for the public\r\npathway had just been closed--and the _attollite portas_ to ever fresh\r\ngenerations of students. Its bronze gates are the old students’ memorial\r\nof her. And on the morning of October 27, 1892, she died, in her room\r\non the garden at Newnham, looking out at the gathering light of the new\r\nday.\r\n\r\nShe was buried with the honours of the head of a college, the Provost\r\nand fellows of King’s offering their chapel for the purpose. She lies in\r\nthe village church-yard of Grantchester, the _civitatula_ which Bede\r\ndescribes where the sons of Ely monastery came to fetch the sarcophagus\r\nfor S. Etheldreda. So in her death she is not divided from the great\r\nmemories which link the history of the university to that of the\r\nmovement to which she gave her life.\r\n\r\nThe first 28 students came into residence in Newnham Hall on October\r\n18th 1875, and found the moment no less thrilling because they\r\napproached the door of their _alma mater_ across planks and unfinished\r\nmasonry. More room was at once needed, and “Norwich House” in the town\r\nwas hired. In 1879 the Newnham Hall Company and the Association for\r\npromoting the Higher Education of Women[469] amalgamated, and as “the\r\nNewnham College Association for advancing education and learning among\r\nwomen in Cambridge” built the second, or North Hall. Thus Newnham Hall\r\nbecame Newnham College. A public pathway led between the two halls, and\r\nthis was not closed till 1891; but in 1886 a still larger building,\r\ncontaining the college hall, was erected, and called Clough Hall, the\r\noriginal Newnham (“South”) Hall becoming the “Old Hall,” and the North\r\nHall becoming “Sidgwick Hall.” Lastly the two original halls were joined\r\nby the “Pfeiffer building”[470] and the college gateway in 1893, and in\r\n1897 Mr. and Mrs. Yates Thompson presented a fine library, the pretty\r\nold library of Newnham Hall which had been built in 1882, being\r\nconverted into a reading room. The land for the three Halls was\r\npurchased from S. John’s College, the hockey field is on Clare land, and\r\nthe total acreage is about ten and a half acres. The college holds 160\r\nstudents, a few ‘out students’ being affiliated to one or other of the\r\nhalls--and consists of a large hall, capable of seating 400 persons, a\r\nsmaller hall and reading room in each building, the library, nine\r\nlecture and class rooms, gymnasium, small hospital, chemical laboratory,\r\nand the Balfour laboratory in the town which is a freehold of the\r\ncollege. The grounds contain two fives courts, lawn tennis courts, and a\r\nhockey ground. In the hall are the portraits of Miss Clough, Professor\r\nand Mrs. Sidgwick, and Miss M. G. Kennedy, as the four people who had\r\ngiven most of their life work to Newnham.[471]\r\n\r\nThe fees vary from £30 to £35 a term according to\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEWNHAM COLLEGE, GATEWAY\r\n\r\nThis shows the east front, and is called the Pfeiffer Building. The\r\nwhole of the buildings are in the Queen Anne style, and were designed by\r\nBasil Champneys. The Bronze Gates were placed here as a memorial to Miss\r\nClough.]\r\n\r\nthe rooms occupied. The college is governed by a Council, and presided\r\nover by a Principal, Old Hall Sidgwick Hall and Clough Hall having each\r\na resident vice-principal.[472] Miss Clough hoped to effect a real and\r\nlasting union between the old students and Newnham--that the college\r\nmight be the support of the students, and the students of the college.\r\nIt was a principle she had always present to her mind, and she herself\r\ndid much to realise it. School and college have long bestowed this\r\nadvantage on men, which is reinforced by the support men are accustomed\r\nto give to each other; but all this is lacking for the woman who goes\r\nforth into the world to fend for herself. University life might however\r\ndo much to supply the want, and it is to be hoped that women will form a\r\ntradition on the point, as men have done. The constitution of the\r\ncollege at least preserves some part of its first Principal’s idea, old\r\nstudents have from the first had a share in the government and a place\r\non the Council.\r\n\r\nCandidates for entrance must pass the College Entrance examination (of\r\nthe same standard as the university Previous Examination), unless they\r\nhave already taken equivalent examinations. The greater number read for\r\na tripos, but students may follow special lines of study. As to its\r\nuniversity successes--the first tripos to be taken was the Moral\r\nSciences (1874), and here Newnham students at once obtained the highest\r\nhonours.[473] In 1876 Sir George Humphry,[474] as one of the examiners\r\nfor the Natural Sciences tripos, when he met his fellow examiners said\r\n“I don’t know, gentlemen, who your first is, but my first is a man\r\ncalled Ogle.” The man called Ogle was a Newnham student.[475] In 1883\r\nfirst classes were obtained in the Second Part of the Classical tripos,\r\nbut Newnham waited till 1885 for its two first wranglers. In 1890 the\r\nUniversity Calendar inserts in its Mathematical tripos list: “P. G.\r\nFawcett, above the Senior Wrangler.” Miss Fawcett obtained (it was\r\nreported) several hundred marks above the university senior wrangler\r\nBennett of John’s. It is customary to ring the bell of Great S. Mary’s\r\nin honour of this _enfant gaté_ of Cambridge university; but Mr. Bennett\r\nstopped the ringing, and a bonfire at Newnham celebrated the occasion.\r\nIn the History tripos two Firsts were obtained in 1879, and this tripos\r\nhas frequently been duplicated with another--the Moral Sciences, Modern\r\nLanguages, Mathematical, Classical, or Law. The first woman to take the\r\ntwo historic triposes, mathematical and classical, together, was Miss E.\r\nM. Creak in 1875. The first examinations in the Medieval and Modern\r\nLanguages tripos were passed in 1886, 1887, and 1888, when Firsts were\r\nobtained, and 30% of first classes have been taken in this tripos.\r\nNewnham has indeed been remarkable from the beginning for the number of\r\nits first class honours in the university lists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Former Newnham students.]\r\n\r\nThere have been 880 honour students, and the total number of past and\r\npresent students is 1600.[476] Like the Girtonians, old Newnhamites are\r\nto be found engaged in all kinds of work and in every corner of the\r\nworld, and like Girton they have their large share of the teachers in\r\nthe County and High schools of the country; the towns which are perhaps\r\nmost conspicuous for the number of Cambridge ‘graduates’ being Norwich,\r\nExeter, Cambridge, and Birmingham. Among the mathematicians one is\r\nlecturer on Physics in the London School of Medicine for Women, another\r\nis mathematical lecturer at the Cambridge Training College, a third is\r\nwarden of the House for Women Students at Liverpool, a fourth (who took\r\nthe Natural Sciences as a second tripos) is senior physician in a Bombay\r\nhospital. Others are lecturers in the Civil Service Department of King’s\r\nCollege London, and others again are teaching in Toronto, Cape Town, the\r\nTraining College of Cape Colony, in Nova Scotia, the diocesan school at\r\nLahore, and at an Indian mission school; one is assistant investigator\r\nin the Labour Department of the Board of Trade, another who was\r\nsecretary for secondary education in the Transvaal is now Chief\r\nAssistant on the Education Committee (Executive Office) of the L.C.C.\r\nThe classics are engaged as classical tutors in Columbia University, in\r\nTrinity College Melbourne, at Mysore, and Cape Colony, at the Girls’\r\nHigh school at Poona, and as lecturers on history in University College\r\nCardiff, on Method in the Chancery Lane Training school of the L.C.C.,\r\nas assistant to the Professor of Humanity at Aberdeen, and as members of\r\nthe educational committees of the Staffordshire County Council and\r\nNewcastle Town Council. The moralists have posts as lecturers at\r\nNewnham, as Mistress of Method at University College Bristol, and in the\r\ntraining department of the government school for girls at Cairo, as\r\nmember of the Chiswick education committee, and as sub-warden of the\r\nWomen’s University Settlement at Southwark; and a senior moralist was\r\nfirst Principal of the Training College Cambridge. The natural\r\nscientists lecture on physiology in the London School of Medicine, on\r\nchemistry in Holloway College, are to be found in the geological\r\nresearch department of Birmingham University, as Quain student of botany\r\nin University College London, and as assistant demonstrator in geology\r\nto the Woodwardian professor at Cambridge. One is in Bloemfontein, one\r\nis sanitary inspector at Hampstead, another assistant curator of the\r\nmuseum at Cape Town, and another in the missionary\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRANARY ON THE CAM\r\n\r\nCoe Fen is on the left, and Prof. George Darwin’s House on the right of\r\nthe Granary. This view is taken close to Queens’ College.]\r\n\r\nschool at Tokio; and a daughter of a late master of S. John’s is a\r\nmarket gardener. The historical students are to be found teaching in New\r\nZealand, Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, and Winnipeg, lecturing in English\r\nliterature in Birmingham University, assisting the Professor of\r\nEducation and assistant secretary in the faculty of commerce and\r\nadministration in Manchester University, Principal of S. Margaret’s Hall\r\nDublin, of the Cambridge Training College, of the Diocesan school at\r\nLahore, of the missionary school at Kobé, Japan, superintendent of the\r\nwomen students in University College Bangor, and on the Education\r\ncommittee of the Somerset County Council. The Medieval and Modern\r\nLanguages students are to be found as tutor and lecturer in French at\r\nUniversity College Bristol, as readers in German at Bryn Mawr College\r\nPhiladelphia, lecturers in English and French at Holloway College,\r\nmistress of the Ladies’ College Durban, and of the convent school\r\nCavendish Square. Teaching in Queen’s College Barbadoes, in Londonderry,\r\nBrecon, and Guernsey (Newnham and Girton students are to be found in\r\nboth the Channel Islands), Vice-principal of the Samuel Morley Memorial\r\nCollege London, and, not least interesting, lecturer at the University\r\nExtension College Exeter. One is assistant librarian of the Acton\r\nlibrary Cambridge, another almoner of King’s College hospital, and a\r\nthird is on the Education committee of the Gateshead County borough\r\nCouncil. Among the 658 who have not taken triposes,[477] among the\r\nusual number of principalships and head and assistant mistress-ships of\r\nschools and colleges, we find old students lecturing in History at the\r\nWomen’s College Baltimore, demonstrating in Physics at Bryn Mawr College\r\nPhiladelphia, lecturer at Smith College Northampton U.S.A., Professor at\r\nWellesley College Massachusetts, tutor at Owens College Manchester, head\r\nof the Presbyterian school Calcutta, head mistress of the Church\r\nMissionaries’ High school Agra, warden of the Women’s University\r\nSettlement Southwark (and ex-vice-principal of Newnham College), and\r\nPrincipal of Alexandra College, Dublin (_LL.D._ of Dublin _honoris\r\ncausa_). One is clinical assistant at the Royal Free hospital, another\r\nis in the superintendent’s office at Guy’s, a third is a physician at\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne and member of the County borough Education committee.\r\nThere is a lecturer in botany at Holloway, the director of a lyceum at\r\nBerlin, a teacher and superintendent of a class for blind women\r\n(Association for the Welfare of the Blind), a clerk to London\r\nuniversity, a member of the council of Queen’s College London, and the\r\nsecretary of the Association of University Women Teachers. These old\r\nstudents are also to be found in Toronto, the West Indies, Vancouver,\r\nNew South Wales, New Zealand, Pietermaritzburg, Natal, Johannesburg,\r\nNorth China, New York, and Christiania; and on the Education committees\r\nof the Dorset, Herefordshire, and West Sussex County Councils, on the\r\nCroydon Education committee, and lecturing on English literature and on\r\nclassical archaeology.\r\n\r\nA large number of students take the tripos with a view to tuition, with\r\nwhich the above lists are, as we see, mainly concerned; but an account\r\nof the literary output of Newnham students is in course of preparation.\r\n\r\nNewnham has formed a collegiate character which is partly due to\r\nelements in its original constitution, partly to its first principal,\r\nand partly to its physical vicinity to the university. To take the last\r\nfirst. The college has always benefited by what one of the professors\r\nonce described to the present writer as “the life of the university\r\npassing through it.” It was not only this proximity, but the fact that\r\nNewnham was the product of the interest taken by university men in the\r\nadvanced education of women--(Girton of a just and fully justified claim\r\nto university education made by women for women)--which made the\r\nacquirement of this character easier: and Newnham has in a marked degree\r\nthe character of the university which harbours it--its cult of solid\r\nlearning, its width and range, the absence of all pretentiousness, of\r\nthat which every man and woman educated at Cambridge abhors as\r\n“priggishness.” The delightful informality of Newnham and the liking for\r\nsimple appearances is already outlined in the first Principal’s views\r\nabout the scheme and the new building; “nothing elaborate or costly” is\r\nwanted: “The simple Cambridge machinery will be found all the better and\r\nall the more lasting because it suggested itself so very naturally, and\r\nalmost, so to speak, created itself. It is all the better for a college,\r\nas for other institutions, when it is not made, but grows.”[478] And\r\nNewnham was not made but has grown, grown “very naturally” out of the\r\n“simple machinery” first designed for it; has “created itself” because\r\nthese simple elements suggested the way and the means of growth. There\r\nis no chapel at Newnham, all sorts and conditions of men have always\r\nbeen found there, and have worshipped God their own way--“not on this\r\nmountain, nor in Jerusalem.” Old students sit at its council board, and\r\ncome up to read in the Long Vacation. Miss Clough governed without\r\nrules, in conditions which were not then normal--which were thought\r\nindeed to be so abnormal that no company of women could venture to\r\naccept them.\r\n\r\nIf the enthusiasm expended over the two colleges by those who did most\r\nfor them--the anxiety when things seemed to go wrong, the rejoicing when\r\nthey went right--be remembered best by those who experienced it, it has\r\nhad its enduring result in the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRANTCHESTER MILL\r\n\r\nThis picturesque old mill is on the upper river about two miles from\r\nCambridge, and is a favourite rendezvous of boating parties. The walk\r\nfrom Cambridge to this mill is by ‘Varsity men called the Grantchester\r\nGrind’. The famous Byron’s Pool is just below the mill.]\r\n\r\nmovement itself. For nothing great is born without enthusiasm, and this\r\nwas one of the greatest movements of the century. The lecturers--those\r\n“trained and practised teachers” who as an original prospectus declared\r\n“were willing to extend the sphere of their instruction“--took no fees,\r\nor returned them for several years as a donation to Newnham. Miss Clough\r\nnot only took no stipend as Principal but helped the college with money;\r\nDr. and Mrs. Sidgwick, in addition to financial help of every kind, gave\r\nup their home in Chesterton and lived in three rooms at the “North Hall”\r\nof which Mrs. Sidgwick became vice-principal; and here Miss Helen\r\nGladstone, Gladstone’s unmarried daughter, acted as her secretary. Miss\r\nM. G. Kennedy has been honorary secretary of the college since 1875,\r\nMrs. Bonham-Carter its honorary treasurer and Mr. Hudson its honorary\r\nauditor. It may fairly be said of Newnham also, that it is partly the\r\noutcome of the enthusiastic loyalty of its first students, who have\r\nsince taken so large a share in its welfare.[479]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The “Graces” of 1881.]\r\n\r\nIn the Lent term of 1881 there happened the greatest event in the\r\nhistory of the women’s university movement. Three “Graces” were proposed\r\nto the Senate (_a_) should women be entitled to examination in the\r\ntriposes (_b_) to a certificate of the place won (_c_) to the insertion\r\nof their names, after that of the men, in all tripos lists, with a\r\nspecification of the corresponding place attained by them in the men’s\r\nlist? On the eve of the day fixed for the vote--February 24th--the vicar\r\nof Little S. Mary’s church and a Mr. Potts announced that they would\r\n_non-placet_ the ‘graces,’ and as the day dawned some believed that\r\ntheir recruits would swamp the vote. On the same evening Mr. John\r\nHollond, late M.P. for Brighton, was differently engaged in the House of\r\nCommons getting members to promise to share in a special train which was\r\nto take them to the university by two o’clock to record their votes, and\r\nget them back to their places by four when there was to be an important\r\ndivision in the House.[480] The students of Girton and Newnham crowded\r\nthe roof of the latter college to watch for the pre-arranged signal--a\r\nhandkerchief tied to the whip of a student who rode along the “Backs”\r\nfrom the Senate House carrying the news. The vote in favour of the\r\nGraces had been 398 to 32, and when it was declared the venerable Dr.\r\nKennedy, the distinguished headmaster of Shrewsbury school and at that\r\ntime Regius Professor of Greek,[481] waved his cap under the eyes of the\r\nvice-chancellor like any schoolboy. The loyal friends now came hurrying\r\nup to Newnham, one by one, Henry Sidgwick, Miss Emily Davies, Professor\r\nCayley (first president of the College Council) Mr. Archer-Hind, Mr.\r\n(now Dr.) J. N. Keynes, and received an ovation from those whose\r\nbattles they had fought to such a successful issue: and if one of the\r\nseniors of the university became a boy in his delight, another\r\nJohnian[482] did not fail to cover himself with glory by his verses in\r\nimitation of Macaulay’s Lay of Horatius, in which “Father Varius” and\r\nhis friends hold the bridge against progress:\r\n\r\n    Then out spake Father Varius\r\n    No craven heart was his:\r\n    ‘To pollmen and to wranglers\r\n    Death comes but once, I wis.\r\n    And how can man live better,\r\n    Or die with more renown,\r\n    Than fighting against Progress\r\n    For the rights of cap and gown?’\r\n\r\nThe anniversary has since been kept at Newnham as “Commemoration” day:\r\nand if one touch were needed to complete it it would be found in Miss\r\nClough’s reminder to the students that they commemorate not only what\r\nwomen gained that day, but what the university gave that day. There was\r\nan amusing sequel to the vote: the official charged with the preparation\r\nof the university certificates consulted a confidential clerk as to the\r\ncolour of the knot of ribbon which is attached to the university\r\nseal--“Don’t you think blue--the university colour?” he hazarded; but\r\nwas met by the prompt and horrified rejoinder “blue stockings, sir, blue\r\nstockings!” So the colour is green.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social life.]\r\n\r\nExcept under special circumstances the age for admission at Newnham and\r\nGirton is 18. Students’ quarters at Newnham consist, in most cases, of a\r\nbed-sitting room; at Girton each student has a sitting room with a small\r\nbedroom leading from it. The necessary furniture is supplied, and can be\r\nsupplemented according to taste by the student. All students must be\r\nwithin college boundaries by 7 o’clock (but with permission they can be\r\nout till 11) and are “marked in” two or three times a day, the chief\r\noccasion being the 7 o’clock “hall.” Girton and Newnham students, if no\r\nother lady is to be present, can only visit men’s rooms accompanied by\r\nsome senior of the college. Visits of men to students’ rooms are not\r\npermitted, except in the case of fathers and brothers; but a student\r\ncannot ask her brother to her room to meet her college friends, for as\r\nMiss Clough observed “the brother of one is not the brother of all.”\r\nCareful supervision with large liberty and an atmosphere which\r\nencourages the students to make themselves the trustees of the rules,\r\ncharacterise both colleges; and women students, as Miss Davies has\r\npointed out, carry on their university life without being subject to the\r\nproctorial control which is found necessary in the case of men.\r\n\r\nIn the early days it required some independence of character to\r\nencounter the gibes and the wonder which women’s life at the university\r\naroused outside it. People who did not know what a “divided skirt” was,\r\nundertook to affirm that all Girtonians wore them: at Newnham some\r\nunconventionality in dress was amply concealed by the general dowdiness\r\nof the early Newnhamite. The dreaded eccentricities in conduct or\r\nclothes would not indeed have killed the movement; and the authorities\r\ndid not allow this dread to paralyse the quality of mercy, so that there\r\nwas in fact small justification for the witty suggestion of a Newnham\r\nstudent that “Mrs. Grundy rampant and two Newnham students couchant”\r\nwould make appropriate armorial bearings for the college. Nevertheless,\r\nas a concession to human weakness, smoking was not, and still is not,\r\ntolerated.\r\n\r\nBoth colleges hold debates in the great hall and also inter-collegiate\r\nand inter-university debates. Here are some of the subjects discussed:\r\n“Is half a loaf better than no bread?” “That we spend too much” (lost).\r\n“That the best education offered to our grandmothers was more adequate\r\nthan that offered by the High Schools of to-day” (lost). The most\r\nimportant society at Newnham, however, is the Political Debating\r\nSociety, and the lively and absorbing interest in politics shown\r\nnowadays by the college is in striking contrast to the general\r\nindifference to politics at Girton. This year (1906) in an\r\ninter-university debate (Oxford and Newnham) the motion “That this house\r\napproves Chamberlain’s conception of empire” resulted in a ‘draw.’ Most\r\nof the students of both colleges are members of the Women’s University\r\nSouthwark Settlement, to which they subscribe. There is a Sunday Society\r\nand two musical societies in addition to the original Choral Society at\r\nNewnham, and societies in connexion with each of the triposes take the\r\nplace of the select “Jabberwock” and “Sunday Reading Society” of earlier\r\ndays. The great indoor institution at both colleges is the students’\r\nparty at 10 p.m. known at Newnham as the “Cocoa.” Two to four is the\r\nchief recreation hour, and there are college, inter-collegiate, and\r\ninter-university hockey, fives, cricket, tennis, and croquet matches.\r\nOne of the first conveniences provided at Newnham was its gymnasium,\r\nwhere in the early days of the college a senior moralist might be seen\r\nleaping over the back of a student who had just been “ploughed” in the\r\ndivinity of the “Little-Go,” and a series of reverend seigniors would\r\nengage in a hopping match round the room led by the youngest “first\r\nyear” who was an acknowledged expert in the art.\r\n\r\nThe public of a generation ago imagined that\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MADINGLEY WINDMILL\r\n\r\nThis old ruin is on a hill near Madingley, about four miles from\r\nCambridge. A great sweep of Fen Country is seen in the far distance. The\r\nlong range of red buildings in the middle distance is Girton College. On\r\na clear day Ely Cathedral can be seen from the left of the windmill.]\r\n\r\nlearned women would not marry and that men would specially ‘fight shy’\r\nof taking to wife women who had done the same work as themselves. It may\r\ntherefore be recorded that the first Newnham student to take a tripos,\r\nwho was also the first lecturer appointed at Newnham Hall, married the\r\nprofessor of Political Economy, and that they wrote a book on that\r\nsubject together. That the first classical lecturer at Newnham married a\r\nwell-known classic and classical tutor of his college (Trinity); that\r\nthe next Moral Sciences lecturer married the distinguished psychologist\r\nwho is now professor of Mental Philosophy; that the first historical\r\nlecturer, Ellen Wordsworth Crofts, married Darwin’s biologist son Mr.\r\nFrancis Darwin; and that the first woman to come out senior classic (a\r\nGirtonian) married the Master of Trinity College, himself senior classic\r\nof his year.\r\n\r\nWriting about the proposed Bedford College for women, in 1848, Frederick\r\nDenison Maurice had declared that “The least bit of knowledge that is\r\nknowledge must be good, and I cannot conceive that a young lady can feel\r\nher mind in a more dangerous state than it was because she has gained\r\none truer glimpse into the conditions under which the world in which it\r\nhas pleased God to place her actually exists.” So “ambitious” a name as\r\n“college” for a girls’ academy had a novel sound “to English ears.”\r\nTo-day the words which excuse and explain its use sound strange and\r\nantiquated in ours. Many of the things about which men have fought and\r\nborne the heat of long days will seem incredible to posterity, and the\r\nrefusal of a ‘college’ or of university education to women will no doubt\r\nbe among them. No one else, nevertheless, had given to women the\r\nopportunity they wanted when Cambridge gave it. Cambridge returned\r\naffirmative answers to each request as it was preferred--in 1863, in\r\n1865, in 1870, and in 1880 when in reply to a memorial signed by 8600\r\npersons praying that the Senate would “grant to properly qualified women\r\nthe right of admission to the examinations for university degrees, and\r\nto the degrees conferred according to the result of such examinations,”\r\nthe Syndicate appointed to consider it returned the memorable answer:\r\n“The Syndicate share the desire of the memorialists that the advantage\r\nof academic training may be secured to women and that the results of\r\nsuch training may be authoritatively tested and certified.”[483] The\r\nirony of history required that this memorial, which led to the granting\r\nof the Graces, should be rolled and unrolled over the drawing room\r\ncarpet of a vice-chancellor known to be hostile to the movement. Forty\r\nyears after F. D. Maurice had penned the words already quoted women had\r\ncome out at the head of the list in each of the principal triposes. The\r\nmost striking instance of the misjudgment which it is possible to make\r\nabout things simply because custom has allowed no one to try them,\r\noccurred at the dinner table of friends of the present writer when the\r\nlate Professor Fawcett, in urging the claims of women to university\r\neducation, said: “I don’t say that a woman would ever be senior\r\nwrangler, but women would take very good places.” His daughter was to be\r\nthe first senior wrangler: but at no other period of English history\r\nwould the comparison have been possible by which a parent could test\r\nsuch capacities in his own child. After this it is not surprising that\r\nlesser men were unable to gauge the unused powers of half the race; and\r\nwhen one spirited person declared he had no objection whatever to women\r\ncompeting with men but that he considered the air of Cambridge would not\r\nbe beneficial to them, the argument was as reasonable as any other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character and choice of work.]\r\n\r\nAs to the character of the work in which women do best. It had been said\r\nthat they would not do well in “abstract” subjects. The tripos in which\r\nthey have taken the highest distinction is the Moral Sciences,[484]\r\nwhere they have been at the top of the list or alone in the First Class\r\nfive times, provoking Punch’s cartoon in the ‘eighties’ of a girl\r\ngraduate entering a first class railway carriage marked “For Ladies\r\nonly.” Their best work has been done in pure mathematics, and, agreeing\r\nin this with the men, it is these subjects which they choose for the\r\nSecond Part of the tripos. In choice of subject the order is as follows\r\n(_a_) Mathematics (_b_) Classics (_c_) History (_d_) Natural Sciences\r\n(_e_) Languages (_f_) Moral Sciences. The scale of success has been\r\nhighest in Moral Sciences, then in (_b_) Languages (_c_) Natural\r\nSciences (_d_) Classics (_e_) History (_f_) Mathematics.[485] The\r\nclassical and mathematical triposes lead to those general tuitional\r\nposts for which so many women seek a university education; the languages\r\ntripos is easier for those women who go up without the usual school\r\npreparation; while the lower places in the history tripos do duty for\r\nthat “ordinary degree” which is not open to women. It is therefore in\r\nthe moral and natural sciences that there is distinct evidence of\r\nchoice of subject: the proportion of women who take the former is\r\noverwhelmingly greater than the proportion of men,[486] and the taste of\r\nwomen for the natural sciences is as marked, a fact which might have\r\nbeen foreseen by those who watched the signs of the times many years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The degree.]\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the degree, of the magic letters _B.A._ and _M.A._, to\r\nwomen, need not be discussed here. That women have the same use for the\r\ndegree as men is obvious; that it strains their alleged liking for\r\nself-sacrifice too far to suggest that they prefer to forgo the\r\nlegitimate rewards of their work, not less so; and it should not be\r\nregarded either as satisfactory or logical that when they do the same\r\nwork the men only should have the recompense. Dublin university has just\r\noffered an _ad eundem_ degree to all women who had qualified themselves\r\nfor the degree at Cambridge or Oxford--187 have taken the _B.A._, 121\r\nthe _M.A._, and three have become doctors of letters or science. The\r\ncredit of this act belongs to the gallant Irishman, and the coffers of\r\nDublin university have thus been enriched, very warrantably, at the\r\nexpense of the impoverished coffers of Cambridge which sent the far\r\nlarger number of graduates.[487]\r\n\r\nWe have moved step by step from the cautious recommendation of the\r\nuniversity that the names of the young girls examined for the Local\r\nExamination should not appear, and that no class lists should be\r\npublished (1865) and the informal examination for the triposes, when for\r\nnine years (until 1881) the examiners in the classical tripos “objected\r\nto state” what class had been attained, to the present state of things\r\nwhen all the “publicity and intrusion” dreaded forty years back in the\r\ncase of little girls being examined somewhere privately in the same town\r\nas little boys, is annually given to hundreds of women in the highest\r\nexamination in the country in the midst of the university. There had\r\nbeen prophets who opined that under these circumstances Cambridge would\r\nbe deserted by the other sex. Visions of the halls of Trinity and John’s\r\nempty and forsaken, while Girton and Newnham poured forth a ceaseless\r\nflow of undergraduates disturbed the sleep of these prophets and seemed\r\nworth putting on record in their waking moments. No sooner were the\r\nLocal Examinations opened to girls in 1865 than the number of boys\r\nentered rose from 629 to 1217;[488] and the largest entry of\r\nundergraduates on record was that of this present year 1906-7. What has\r\nhappened? Has a robuster generation of undergraduates arisen, or were\r\nthe undergraduates of the “seventies” and “eighties” simply maligned?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The status of women students at Cambridge and Oxford.]\r\n\r\nAs between the two ancient universities Cambridge remains the pioneer in\r\nthe education of women. The examinations are open to women at Oxford,\r\nbut the same restrictions as to preliminaries and residence are not\r\nimposed.[489] It is, however, by the restrictions imposed that Cambridge\r\nhas established the position of its women students. It has thus bound\r\nitself to compare the work of all tripos students irrespective of sex.\r\nWhile at Oxford there is no university recognition of the status of the\r\ncandidate or of her hall, and no university certificate of the place\r\nobtained, Girton and Newnham are recognised colleges at Cambridge; the\r\nname of the successful candidate followed by that of the college is read\r\naloud in the Senate House and published on the Senate House door; and\r\nonly students presented by these colleges are admitted to the university\r\nexaminations, as is the case with men. Girton and Newnham each owe\r\nsomething to the other. Newnham to Girton in the collegiate status now\r\nenjoyed by both, Girton to Newnham because the considerable advantages\r\naccruing to women students through proximity to Cambridge have been\r\nreflected on the sister college. Each displayed a boldness distinctively\r\nits own which has been the main source of the success of the movement:\r\nNewnham planted her house of students in the university town, Girton\r\nasked to follow the same curriculum as men; and these two things have\r\nhad a mutually favourable reaction ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nNames of Persons and of Cambridge Families referred to in the Text\r\n\r\n_chr._ = chancellor, _v.-c._ = vice-chancellor, _proc._ = proctor (of\r\nthe university), _M._ = master (of a college), _abp._ = archbishop,\r\n_bp._ = bishop.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcre, Joan d’, 64 _n._, 298\r\n\r\nActon, 1st lord, professor, 192, (quoted) 99\r\n\r\nAdams, Prof. John Couch, 126, 172 _n._, 191, 291, 318 _n._, 329 _n._,\r\n  Mrs., 329 _n._,\r\n  Sir T., founder of chair of Arabic, 190\r\n\r\nAddenbrooke, Dr. John, 115\r\n\r\nAgnes, daughter of Philip the tailor [_Rot.

Edw. III. had quarried it for King’s Hall, and\r\n Hen. IV. granted more of the stone for King’s Hall chapel. Finally\r\n Mary gave the stone to Sir Robert Huddleston in 1557 for his new house\r\n at Sawston: “Hereby that stately structure, anciently the ornament of\r\n Cambridge, is at this day reduced next to nothing,” writes Fuller.\r\n\r\n [6] A-S.

Cf. also note _infra_\r\n p. 7, on the name of the river.\r\n\r\n [7] The Roman _Deva_.\r\n\r\n [8] Caius, writing in 1447, says that the town is divided into two\r\n parts by the Canta and the Rhee, called earlier le Ee; and by Spenser\r\n the Cle. We have _Granta_, _Guant_, and _Cante_: the _r_ dropped out,\r\n and _G_ was replaced by _C_ in the name of both town and river (see\r\n _supra_). Cante does not seem to have been the name of a river at all.\r\n The river bank by Castle Mound is spoken of in the xiv c. as “the\r\n common bank called Cante“: one arm at least of the Cambridge river was\r\n known simply as “the water” [Prof. Skeat has pointed out that Ee is\r\n the xii, xiii, and xiv c. form of the A-S. _éa_, cognate with _aqua_]\r\n and for centuries there would appear to have been no need for any\r\n other name. In Henry of Huntingdon’s Chronicle (1130) the river is\r\n called the _Grenta_; but Lydgate writes\r\n\r\n    And of this noble vniuersitie\r\n    Sett on this ryver which is called Cante.\r\n\r\n In the same decade Spenser knows only the Guant (_Faery Queene, Book\r\n iv, Canto xi._ 1590) and Camden for the first time tells us that it\r\n was called both Granta and Cam (_alii Grantam_, _Camum alii._ 1586)\r\n the name used as we have seen by Milton. If there was no river Cante\r\n _à fortiori_ there was no river Cam; for the _m_ in the name of\r\n the town is only another change in the original first syllable of\r\n Cambridge. See _footnote_, p. 6.\r\n\r\n [9] Trumpington is 2 miles S., Grantchester 2 miles S.S.W. of the town.\r\n\r\n [10] 878. It was from the town (Grantebrycge) that the Danes set\r\n forth, two years before, and surprised Alfred at Wareham. In the\r\n time of Ethelred, just before the Danish invasion, Cambridge was a\r\n royal mint; it was so in the time of the Conqueror, and had a Danish\r\n ‘moneyer,’ and continued to be so under the Plantagenet kings: even\r\n Henry VI. coined money at Cambridge. In Domesday the town is described\r\n as a “Hundred,” a description, says Stubbs, belonging to big towns\r\n with large surrounding common land--Norwich and Canterbury are\r\n similarly described. After the history of the town became merged in\r\n that of the university, two parliaments were summoned there; in 1388,\r\n and in 1447 (afterwards held at Bury-St.-Edmund’s). For the city, see\r\n also p. 36 and v. p. 260.\r\n\r\n [11] Fuller, p. 7.\r\n\r\n [12] The edict expelling the Jews from England dates from 1290, and\r\n the Jews left Cambridge the year following.\r\n\r\n [13] The fancy appellations Cam and Isis appear to have both been due\r\n to Camden. They are not heard of before his work appeared in 1586.\r\n\r\n [14] Cambridge, writes Doctor Jessopp, existed as a town and fortress\r\n “a thousand years before Oxford was anything but a desolate swamp, or\r\n at most a trumpery village, where a handful of Britons speared eels,\r\n hunted for deer, and laboriously manufactured earthenware pots.”\r\n\r\n [15] They found a Roman stone coffin, sculptured; one, apparently, of\r\n many known to have been left there, for portions of Roman sarcophagi\r\n are even now to be seen walled up in the church at Grantchester. Bede,\r\n cap. xix.\r\n\r\n [16] The pollard willow is the chief denizen of the fens.\r\n\r\n [17] The water runs flows and dances through the Cantabrigian’s life.\r\n The king’s and the bishop’s mills, Newnham mill just beyond, the Mill\r\n street, and the hythes, all courted constant recognition. As at Ely,\r\n the _hythes_ were the small trading ports along the river: there was\r\n Dame Nichol’s hythe, Cornhythe, Flaxhythe, Salthythe, Clayhythe.\r\n\r\n [18] For the vii c. foundation of _Ely_ see chap. vi. p. 311. The see\r\n dates from 1107, when the minster became a cathedral. _Crowland_, in\r\n Lincolnshire on the borders of Cambridgeshire, was built over the tomb\r\n of Guthlac, a prince and a saint of the house of Mercia, in the vii c.\r\n _Bury_ rose after the martyrdom of the East Anglian king Edmund (870)\r\n _c._ 903; it did not become a monastery till 1020. _Peterborough_ was\r\n founded by Wulfhere, king of Mercia from 659 to 674: it formed part\r\n of the diocese of Lincoln till the xvi c. Ramsey and Thorney were\r\n other fen monasteries. Ramsey was on the borders, in Huntingdonshire,\r\n but Thorney was in Cambridgeshire. Peterborough and Thorney with Ely\r\n and Crowland were sacked by the Danes in 870. All these were ‘black\r\n Benedictine’ houses.\r\n\r\n [19] Cottenham 7 miles north of Cambridge; the benefice became an\r\n advowson of Chatteris abbey in the isle of Ely, and was bestowed by\r\n the abbess on Warham in 1500.\r\n\r\n [20] Joffred was appointed abbot of Crowland in 1109 in succession to\r\n Ingulph: the xiv c. forgery the _Historia Croylandensis_ pretends to\r\n be written by Ingulph (_nat._ 1030) and continued by Peter of Blois.\r\n It contains fables about the antiquity of Oxford. See _Ingulph and the\r\n Historia Croylandensis_ by W. G. Searle, _M.A._\r\n\r\n [21] p. 8.\r\n\r\n [22] Fuller.\r\n\r\n [23] “The monk Odo, a singular grammarian and satirical poet, read\r\n grammar to the boys and those of the younger sort assigned to him”;\r\n logic and rhetoric were imparted to the elder scholars. _Soi-disant\r\n Peter of Blois._\r\n\r\n [24] iii. p. 164. Their school was in the parish where the university\r\n schools rose later--under the shadow of Great S. Mary’s; and opposite\r\n was Le Glomery Lane (the _Vicus Glomeriae_).\r\n\r\n [25] _La Bataille des vii Ars._ Oeuvres Rutebeuf, Paris 1839, ii. 415.\r\n\r\n [26] Abbot Sampson (_b._ 1135) had himself been “a poor clerke” at the\r\n school of Bury, and William Diss, a Norfolk man, was the schoolmaster.\r\n In 1160 Sampson became its _magister scholarum_. He proceeded to buy\r\n certain stone houses--those solid structures which either as Jewish or\r\n Norman building were sought for at Cambridge and at Oxford also--so\r\n that the scholars might live rent free; and in 1198 he endowed the\r\n _magister scolarum grammaticalium_ so that the tuition too became\r\n free. (_The Chronicle of Jocelin of Brakelond_, newly edited by\r\n Sir Ernest Clarke, _M.A., F.S.A._) “School Hall Street” was just\r\n outside the abbey precincts, and answered to the “School Street” and\r\n the _Vicus Glomeriae_ in Cambridge. There was an ancient chapel in\r\n Cambridge dedicated to the patron saint of Bury, and one of the chief\r\n possessions of that rich abbey was the manor of Mildenhall, which\r\n provided the expenses of its sacrist and cellarer: it is at least an\r\n interesting coincidence that Robert and Edmund of Mildenhall were\r\n original fellows of Michaelhouse; the former was its second master,\r\n third master, according to Le Neve, of Peterhouse, and chancellor of\r\n the university in 1334. An abbot and a monk of Bury are two of those\r\n to be specially commemorated in every mass said by the scholars of\r\n the new foundation of Michaelhouse (1324); and Curteys the 24th abbot\r\n of Bury was one of the personages invited by Henry VI. to assist at\r\n the laying of the foundation stone of King’s College. Walter Diss (a\r\n name well known in Bury) was a famous Carmelite friar at Cambridge in\r\n the xiv c. Fuller preserves the legend that Jocelyn, Abbot Sampson’s\r\n Boswell, had studied in the Cambridge schools, the source of which\r\n is Bale who was a Carmelite of Norwich and Cambridge. Together these\r\n things perhaps suggest that the schools of Cambridge and Bury had some\r\n relation to each other as well as to Orléans.\r\n\r\n Bury was reckoned among fen monasteries because of its Suffolk\r\n property (of which Mildenhall formed part) where the See of Ely\r\n possessed several manors.\r\n\r\n [27] A Henry of Orléans was sub-bailiff of Cambridge in the 2nd year\r\n of Edw. I. (Hundred Rolls i. p. 49).\r\n\r\n [28] The transformation of houses of canons serving a church or\r\n cathedral into Regular Canons in the xii and xiii centuries was the\r\n effect of the rule indited by Yvo of Chartres which gave its final\r\n form and name to the “Canons Regular of S. Augustine” at the end of\r\n the xi c. The canons of S. Giles and Lanfranc’s hospital of S. Gregory\r\n at Canterbury were among the earliest of these communities to be\r\n converted, in the reign of Henry I., into Regulars.\r\n\r\n [29] In the xi and xii centuries a large number of hospitals of the\r\n order of S. Augustine were founded for the relief of poor and impotent\r\n persons, the type being that of the Whittington hospital in London.\r\n Sometimes their object was to succour the wayfarer, sometimes they\r\n were virtually almshouses where leprous and indigent “brethren” formed\r\n the larger part of the community with a few “healthful brethren”\r\n and the master to look after them. Such was the origin, in the xi\r\n c., of the Knights of Malta, or Order of the Hospital of S. John of\r\n Jerusalem. At Canterbury Lanfranc erected a hospital of S. Gregory; at\r\n Oxford the hospital of S. Bartholomew, founded in the reign of Hen.\r\n I., was bestowed by Edw. III. on Oriel College; and Magdalen, Oxford,\r\n was erected on the site of another S. John’s hospital, which numbered\r\n brethren and sisters among its members. Amalfi merchants trading to\r\n the Holy Land endowed the first “master and brethren” of the Order\r\n of S. John of Jerusalem; a well-to-do burgess endowed the Cambridge\r\n hospice, and the nobles, the bishops, and the sovereign himself are\r\n to be numbered among the founders and benefactors of these first\r\n almshouses and hospitals. Cf. ii. p. 117 _n._\r\n\r\n [30] See chap. ii. Peterhouse and S. John’s.\r\n\r\n [31] See chap. ii. S. John’s and Jesus Colleges.\r\n\r\n [32] Fordham and Mirmaud-at-Welle. The Gilbertines of Chiksand in\r\n Bedfordshire had a house and garden in King’s Childers’ Lane by King’s\r\n Hall, which they leased to the university for the schools quadrangle\r\n in 1433. The Gilbertines were a double Order of nuns and canons;\r\n the former followed the Cistercian rule but were never affiliated\r\n to that Order. The canons followed the rule of S. Augustine, but\r\n the sympathies, like the dress, of the Gilbertines were Cistercian:\r\n “_militat sub instituto Cisterciensi_.” Only in this indirect way did\r\n Citeaux enter Cambridge: but see i. p. 25 and ii. p. 143.\r\n\r\n [33] The Carmelite Bale says: _ex omni factione sua primus tandem fuit\r\n qui theologicus doctor sit effectus_. Pits says the same in the _De\r\n illust. Angl. Script._ For Carmelite property in Cambridge see also\r\n vi. pp. 325-6.\r\n\r\n [34] This was the treatise known in Cambridge as ‘the black book,’ in\r\n which Prior Cantilupe tells of Cantaber and his son Grantanus, and\r\n their foundation of Cambridge on the site of Caergrant.\r\n\r\n [35] The prison or tolbooth had been the house of Benjamin the Jew,\r\n which became university property in the reign of Elizabeth, but after\r\n a famous trial in the next reign reverted to the citizens. Like the\r\n Jewish houses elsewhere it was amongst the most solid structures in\r\n the town.\r\n\r\n [36] Dugdale says “before 1275.” Their priory was enlarged and perhaps\r\n refounded by Alice, wife of de Vere second Earl of Oxford.\r\n\r\n [37] Chap. ii., Sidney Sussex and Emmanuel Colleges.\r\n\r\n [38] v. p. 275.\r\n\r\n [39] All branches of the Augustinians were represented at Cambridge:\r\n the Augustinian canon at Barnwell, the hospitaller at S. John’s, and\r\n the hermit-friar at the Austin friary. ‘_The friars heremites of the\r\n order of S. Austin_’ were settled in Suffolk from the middle of the\r\n xiii c., probably by Richard de Clare Earl of Gloucester and Lord of\r\n the honour of Clare. One of their chief benefactors was Elizabeth de\r\n Burgh. See Clare College chap. ii. p. 64.\r\n\r\n [40] Confraternities and friars “of the Sack,” known as Sacconi in\r\n their birthplace, Italy, and so called because of the loose gown or\r\n ‘sack’ common to begging friars and confraternities, and also because\r\n of the large sacks which they sometimes carried when begging for\r\n the poor, were associations due to the preaching of S. Francis and\r\n especially of S. Antony of Padua in the first quarter of the xiii c.\r\n So that the Cambridge friars, dispersed after the Council of Lyons\r\n in 1307, were one of the earliest of these communities; and it is\r\n interesting to find them addicted to scholarship.\r\n\r\n [41] Matthew Paris, anno 1257. _Concessa est mansio fratribus\r\n Bethleemitis in Cantabrigia, silicet in vico qui ducit versus\r\n Trumpintonam._\r\n\r\n [42] They were begging friars following the rule of S. Austin.\r\n\r\n [43] They had held land in Cambridge for over 100 years “of the gift\r\n of the earl of Mandeville.” At the Suppression they were seized of\r\n land in Haslyngfeld, co. Cambridge. Cf. ii. p. 96.\r\n\r\n [44] The property was situated “in Henney,” a well-known part of Mill\r\n Street in the parish of S. John Baptist, and included the stone house\r\n on the high street by S. Michael’s rectory house which passed to the\r\n family of Sir John Cambridge in 1311 was by him bequeathed to Corpus\r\n Christi College, and became the nucleus of Gonville Hall. The prior of\r\n Anglesey is found leasing this land in the reign of Edward III., and\r\n selling it to Henry VI. in 1447. The priory lay between Cambridge and\r\n Newmarket.\r\n\r\n [45] _Rot. Hund._ ii. 360. Cf. also _ibid._ p. 370.\r\n\r\n [46] pp. 25 _n._, 49 and ii. p. 90.\r\n\r\n [47] Another piece of this ground was conveyed by Henry VI. (who\r\n bought it of the university in the same year) to Trinity Hall in 1440\r\n (and became the college garden). It is there described as “a void\r\n ground” _pertinent priori et confratribus sancti Johannis in Anglia_.\r\n Crouched hostel had already been pulled down for the schools. Like\r\n other hostels in Mill Street--God’s house, S. Nicholas, and Austin’s\r\n (see King’s and Christ’s Colleges) it stood, as we see, on open\r\n ground: “a certain garden of the hostel of the Holy Cross” we hear of\r\n in 1421.\r\n\r\n [48] It is supposed that monks from Denney and Tyltey came here to\r\n study. The former was in fact a cell to Ely abbey before Marie de\r\n Chatillon transferred the Franciscans of Waterbeach thither. The\r\n two ‘nuns of the Order of S. Clare’ who were friends of Erasmus at\r\n Cambridge were probably inmates of Denney. In _Rot. Hund._ two other\r\n communities are recorded: the _moniales de Pato_, of whom we know\r\n nothing--there is a _Paston_ in Norfolk and another in Northants.;\r\n and ‘the monks of the Holy Trinity at Cambridge’ who are mentioned in\r\n the Oxford Hundred Rolls of the 7th year of Edw. I.: the name affords\r\n another instance of the antiquity and popularity of this dedication\r\n to the Trinity, which we find at Michaelhouse, Trinity Hall, Trinity\r\n church, and in the guild of the Trinity at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n [49] p. 127.\r\n\r\n [50] Fuller.\r\n\r\n [51] For later monastic influences in Cambridge, see ii. pp. 127-9,\r\n Magdalene College.\r\n\r\n [52] Pembroke College p. 69.

The _Statuta Antiqua_, the old body of\r\n statutes of the university, have for the most part no chronological\r\n arrangement, and the date cannot in some cases be determined to within\r\n a century. The earliest ‘grace’ to which a date is attached belongs\r\n to the year 1359, but there is another referable to the year 1275/6.\r\n The latest, reduced to chronological order, is of the year 1506. The\r\n _Statuta Antiqua_ were replaced in the 12th year of Elizabeth by a\r\n fresh body of statutes, and these again by the statutes of Victoria,\r\n 1882. The former are printed in Dyer’s _Privileges of the University_.\r\n\r\n [54] Simon Montacute (1337-1345) ceded the right of the bishops of Ely\r\n to the presentation of fellowships in their own college of Peterhouse.\r\n Cf. also iv. pp. 203-4.\r\n\r\n [55] Dated February 20, 624; and 689.

P. Benedicti, caput\r\n lx._\r\n\r\n [57] See, chap, ii., Michaelhouse, Corpus, Gonville, and Trinity Hall.\r\n\r\n [58] A chartered corporation and a university in the sense of a\r\n _studium generale_ possessing European privileges. Cambridge was a\r\n _universitas_ many years before this, and was so familiarly styled by\r\n Henry III. in 1231.\r\n\r\n [59] It has been pointed out that our knowledge of Oxford’s\r\n intellectual activity during the xii c. is confined to the visits\r\n of three or four celebrated teachers who lectured to its changing\r\n population and in its schools, among which the priory school of S.\r\n Frideswide was the most important. We must not of course confuse\r\n the activities of monastic and episcopal schools with those of a\r\n university.\r\n\r\n [60] Matthew Paris, _in anno 1209: Ita quod nec unus ex omni\r\n universitate remansit_.\r\n\r\n [61] p. 47.\r\n\r\n [62] _Satis constat vobis quod apud villam nostrum Cantebr’ studendi\r\n causa e diversis partibus tam cismarinis quam transmarinis confluit\r\n multitudo, quod valde gratum habemus et acceptamus, cum exemplum\r\n toti regno nostro commodum non modicum, et honor nobis accrescat,\r\n et vos specialiter inter quos fideliter conversantur studentes non\r\n mediocriter gaudere debetis et laetari._\r\n\r\n [63] _Clerk_ and _scholar_ were used interchangeably in the xiii c.\r\n as they are in these two rescripts, _clericus_ being employed in the\r\n rescript of 1218 and in that addressed to the sheriff (_vicecomes_)\r\n of the county cited above: _Quoniam ut audivimus plures nominantur_\r\n clerici _apud Cantabr. qui sub nullius magistri scholarum sunt\r\n disciplina et tuitione, sed potius mentiuntur se esse_ scholares\r\n _cum non sint_.... In a further rescript of the king’s the meaning\r\n is no less clear: _Ita tamen quod ad suspensionem vel mutilationem\r\n clericorum non procedatis, sed eos alio modo per consilium\r\n universitatis Cantabr. castigetis_. (Referring to “insults recently\r\n offered to certain northern scholars of the university of Cambridge,”\r\n 1261.) In the Hundred Rolls, at the same period, we have _clerici de\r\n Merton_ and _scholares de Merton_; and _clerici in scholis degentes_\r\n is W. de Merton’s own description of his scholars.\r\n\r\n [64] The charter of Oxford university belongs to the same reign.\r\n\r\n [65] _Rot. Hund._ 7th Edw. I.\r\n\r\n [66] The Pope no doubt refers to the forged bulls (p. 28) but his\r\n reference to previous royal rescripts is likely to be more correct,\r\n and to have been supplied by Edward himself.\r\n\r\n [67] See _studium generale_ pp. 30 _n._, 31.\r\n\r\n [68] The importance of Cambridge was steadily growing in the reigns\r\n of Henry I. and Stephen. The isle of Ely supported Matilda; and the\r\n earldom of Cambridge was conferred both by her and by Stephen for the\r\n first time. The former by her letters, issued before the year 1146,\r\n bestowed it on her favourite Aubrey de Vere, “if the King of Scotland\r\n hath it not,” as prior in dignity to the counties of “Oxfordshire,\r\n Berkshire, Wiltshire, or Dorsetshire” one of which he was to take if\r\n Stephen’s gift of the earldom of Cambridge to Saint David of Scotland\r\n held good. De Vere had to accept the county of Oxford which has since\r\n remained in that family--the earldom of Cambridge passing to royal\r\n hands and becoming in time a royal dukedom. David of Scotland held\r\n Cambridge in his own and Huntingdon in right of his wife. Malcolm of\r\n Scotland held both earldoms together in exchange for the northern\r\n counties of Northumberland and Cumberland. The union of these earldoms\r\n is still represented by the union of Huntingdon and Cambridge under\r\n one _vicecomes_ or sheriff. Edward III. created his wife’s brother\r\n (the Count of Hainault) and after him his son Edmund Langley, earls of\r\n Cambridge. Edmund’s son Richard held the earldom until his attainder,\r\n and his son Richard Duke of York was again created Earl of Cambridge\r\n by Henry V. (p. 295). This was Edward IV.’s father in whom the earldom\r\n became merged in the crown. The arms of Edmund Langley, Duke of York\r\n and Earl of Cambridge, are on the first of the 6 shields of arms of\r\n Edward’s sons over the entrance gate of Trinity; beneath is inscribed:\r\n EDMONDUS D.

For the relation of the\r\n English queens to the university see Queens’ College pp. 109, 112, and\r\n p. 114.\r\n\r\n Edward III. allowed the university to appropriate any church of the\r\n yearly value of £40; to receive (through its chancellor) the oaths\r\n of the mayor and aldermen and the bailiffs; to take cognizance of\r\n all causes in which the scholars were concerned, “maim and felony”\r\n excepted; and required that the chancellor should not be disquieted if\r\n he imprisoned offenders; that masters of arts should not be cited out\r\n of the university; and that the mayor should make assay of the weight\r\n of bread as often as the chancellor demanded it.\r\n\r\n [73] pp. 29, 54.\r\n\r\n [74] Peterhouse p. 55, S.

I. p.\r\n 366, a certain John gives a quit rent to the scholars of Merton for 18\r\n acres of this property.\r\n\r\n [77] The priory of S. Frideswide granted him land in 1265, and he\r\n obtained much more two years later.\r\n\r\n [78] The wording provides for the existing or any other _ordinatio_\r\n Merton may formulate.\r\n\r\n [79] “_Domus scolarium de Merton._” _Burg. Cantebr. Rot. Hund._ i. 55.\r\n\r\n [80] _Rot. Hund._ ii. 360.\r\n\r\n [81] The “Merton clerks,” _clerici de Merton_, are mentioned again in\r\n the next paragraph. At the same date a certain Johanna declares that\r\n she had as a marriage portion from her father a messuage given him by\r\n Cecil at the Castle, for which is paid a quit rent of twelve pence a\r\n year to “the scholars of Merton.” _Rot. Hund._ ii. 379. In the Hundred\r\n of Chesterton (p. 402) we find that “the scholars of Merton hold of\r\n the fee of Hervey Dunning” such and such properties. They also paid a\r\n quit rent to Edmund Crouchback for lands he held (on the death of de\r\n Montfort) as earl of Leicester.\r\n\r\n [82] _Rot. Hund._ ii. 364, 407.\r\n\r\n [83] The general rule in these Rolls is to add no qualification of\r\n origin in cases where the owner, or religious house, has another\r\n habitation in the locality to which the transaction refers. Hence we\r\n find “the prior of Anglesey,” “the prioress of Stratford,” side by\r\n side with “the scholars of Merton” in the Cambridge Hundred Rolls (cf.\r\n _Rot. Hund._ ii. 364).\r\n\r\n [84] Grantchester (7th Edw. I. p. 565): _et tota dicta pars alienata\r\n est scolaribus Oxon’ per dominum Walter’ de Merton’, nescit quo\r\n warranto_. Gamlingay: “William of Leicester sold the whole of that\r\n holding to _dominus_ Walter de Merton and the said Walter _gave it all\r\n to the scholars_ of the _domus de Merton Oxonie_.”\r\n\r\n [85] “Villani ejusd’ Gunnor’ dicunt quod _prior de Mertone_” held the\r\n advowson of the church of Barton. (_Rot. Hund._ ii. 564.)\r\n\r\n The Bishop of Nelson points out that the scholars were called not\r\n after Walter de Merton, but after the place--Merton priory. Merton\r\n himself had no surname; he was born at Basingstoke, and was perhaps\r\n educated at the priory from which he also took his name. Beket was\r\n certainly educated at this well-known Merton, which gave its name\r\n to the “Statute of Merton” devised there in 1236, and was also the\r\n theatre of a council held by the archbishop 22 years later. At the\r\n evaluation of 1291, the priory held property in Norfolk (_Index\r\n Monasticus_). The Cambridge estates settled on the scholars of the\r\n _domus apud Meandon_ (Malden) in 1270 were in Gamlingay, _Merton_,\r\n _Over-Merton_, Chesterton, etc. It is worth notice that among a number\r\n of scholars who received the king’s pardon in 1261 for the part they\r\n had taken in a riot, there is a _William de Merton_, servant to two of\r\n the East Anglian scholars implicated.\r\n\r\n [86] For the “Ely scholars” see ii. pp. 122-3. The first _to leave an\r\n endowment_ for scholars was William of Durham in 1249; but several\r\n years elapsed before the fund was utilised, scholars maintained, or\r\n University College Oxford founded. University College was thus the\r\n outcome of an earlier _intention_ to endow, and Balliol College was an\r\n earlier foundation in embryo, than either Peterhouse or Merton.\r\n\r\n [87] The preamble of these letters addressed to the civic\r\n authorities at Northampton is as follows: _Occasione cuiusdam\r\n magnae contentionis in villa Cantabrigiensi triennio jam elapso\r\n subortae nonnulli clericorum tunc ibidem studentium unanimiter ab\r\n ipsa villa recessissent, se usque ad villam nostram praedictam\r\n Northam. transferentes et ibidem (studiis inherendo) novam construere\r\n universitatem cupientes_. The letters are dated from Westminster 1\r\n Feb. in the 49th year of his reign (1265). _Rot.

Austin’s or Augustine’s hostel had a length of 220 feet with\r\n 80 of breadth.\r\n\r\n [96] See _pensioners_, iv. p. 217 _n_.\r\n\r\n Mr. J. Bass Mullinger has published (_Hist. Univ. Camb._ pp. 218-220)\r\n a highly interesting statute relating to hostels which dates in\r\n all probability from the end of the xiii c., and shows how rapidly\r\n university rights in these _hospitia locanda_ were extended as a\r\n consequence of Henry’s rescript (p. 47). Any scholar who “desired to\r\n be principal of a hostel” offered his “caution“--with sureties or\r\n pledges--to the landlord and became _ipso facto_ its head, and could\r\n be instituted by the chancellor against the will of the landlord. The\r\n scholar, who has become principal, may not abdicate in favour of a\r\n fellow scholar but only give up possession to the said landlord. The\r\n next candidate could also appeal to the chancellor should the landlord\r\n refuse his request to succeed when a vacancy in the principalship\r\n occurred. An interesting clause provides that though the landlord\r\n should agree with the scholar-principal that “mine hostel” should not\r\n be taxed, the scholars who come to live there may, in spite of both\r\n of them, have the house taxed by the taxors, “inasmuch as agreements\r\n between private persons cannot have effect to the prejudice of public\r\n rights.”\r\n\r\n [97] For university and collegiate officials, see iv. pp. 203-10.\r\n\r\n [98] i. 29, 38, ii. 55-6.\r\n\r\n [99] See iv. 217 _n._, and early college discipline pp. 221-2.\r\n\r\n [100] Balsham (a village 9-1/2 miles S.E. of Cambridge) was one of the\r\n 10 manorhouses, palaces, and castles of the bishops of Ely in the xiv\r\n c. Montacute resided here in 1341. In 1401 a controversy regarding\r\n archidiaconal jurisdiction in the university was held here: a similar\r\n dispute occurred in Balsham’s time (p. 28). On the alienation of this\r\n manor from the see of Ely it was purchased by the founder of the\r\n Charterhouse, and now forms part of the endowment of that college.\r\n There is a mention of Hugh de Balsham (Hugo de Belesale) in Matthew\r\n Paris.\r\n\r\n [101] S.

The wall and water gate were made during\r\n the mastership of Warkworth and the episcopacy of Alcock (1486-1500)\r\n and ornamented with the arms of the latter, who was probably a\r\n Peterhouse man.\r\n\r\n [104] i. p. 22. Their house was on a messuage purchased by them\r\n “opposite the chapel of S. Edmund“: it lay on the south of the two\r\n hostels, and reached “as far as the marsh“--_i.e._ Coe fen.\r\n\r\n [105] The rebuilding of the hall and combination room took place in\r\n 1866-70. Gilbert Scott, William Morris, Burne-Jones and Ford Madox\r\n Brown were called in, and an excellent piece of work accomplished, the\r\n fellows’ old “Stone parlour” and “inner parlour” being thrown into one\r\n to make the present picturesque combination room.\r\n\r\n [106] College libraries, p. 138 _n._ The two Beauforts, the Cardinal\r\n and the Duke of Exeter, and two of Henry VI.’s physicians Roger\r\n Marshall and John Somerset (p. 106), all enriched this library.\r\n\r\n [107] _Beata Maria de Gratia._ For S.

Isaac Barrow uncle of his great namesake was\r\n one of the fellows ejected by the Puritan commissioners, before his\r\n nephew who had been entered for the college could come into residence.\r\n Crashaw was another; and Whitgift was a third fellow whose name stands\r\n for anti-Puritanism.\r\n\r\n [110] Both sent by Edward VI. to inculcate Protestant doctrine in\r\n Cambridge.\r\n\r\n [111] See v. p. 278.\r\n\r\n [112] In the reign of Richard II. the merits of the Peterhouse\r\n scholars were as celebrated as their “indigence” was “notorious”;\r\n they continued in unceasing exercise of discipline and study, and the\r\n tithes of Cherry Hinton appear to have been bestowed in the hope of\r\n providing through them a bulwark against lollardry.\r\n\r\n [113] The Bible-clerks (_bibliotistae_) were so called because it was\r\n their duty to read the Scriptures in hall at meal time: they were a\r\n sort of poorer scholar or ‘sizar,’ see iv. p. 219.\r\n\r\n [114] He was Chancellor of the Exchequer to Edward II.; Canon of York\r\n and Wells, and Rector of East Dereham and of North Creake in Norfolk.\r\n For Michaelhouse, see also Statutes p. 67 and Trinity College p. 133.\r\n\r\n [115] Elizabeth de Burgh speaks of “the college” of her “aforesaid\r\n house.” Cf. the words used by the founder of Trinity Hall as regards\r\n his own foundation: University Calendar _sub rubrica_ Trinity Hall.\r\n\r\n [116] See royal visits, p. 113.\r\n\r\n [117] See Mill Street, pp. 96-7 _n._\r\n\r\n [118] She was daughter of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester and\r\n Hertford by Joan daughter of Edward I. Her brother and co-heir fell\r\n at Bannockburn 1314. Like Lady Margaret she was three times married,\r\n first to John de Burgh son and heir of Richard Earl of Ulster, her\r\n third husband also being an Irishman.\r\n\r\n Chancellor Badew was a member of the Chelmsford knightly family of\r\n that name.\r\n\r\n [119] April 5 1340. Grant by the university of the _domus\r\n universitatis_ to Elizabeth de Burgh Lady de Clare, in consideration\r\n of her gift of the advowson of Litlyngton. See Caius p. 144 _n._\r\n\r\n [120] Peterhouse, Michaelhouse, Clare House--the earliest name for\r\n a Cambridge college; Corpus also was incorporated as the _Domus\r\n Scholarium Corporis Christi_, etc. King’s Hall is the first to be\r\n so styled and is followed by Pembroke Hall. In 1440 we have King’s\r\n College. Peterhouse and Trinity Hall are now the only colleges which\r\n retain the older style, although Clare itself was called Clare Hall\r\n until 1856.\r\n\r\n [121] Cf. p. 109 _n._\r\n\r\n [122] “Soler,” apparently used for a loggia or balcony. East Anglian\r\n belfries were called bell-solers. Cf. _solarium_ for an upper chamber,\r\n and _nei solai_ (Ital.) for “in the garrets.” In early Cambridge\r\n college nomenclature _solar_ was an upstairs, _celar_ (cellar) a\r\n downstairs room.\r\n\r\n [123] Simon Montacute, 17th Bishop of Ely, re-wrote the statutes of\r\n Peterhouse, 1338-44.\r\n\r\n [124] Cf. Merton’s “Oxoniae, vel alibi ubi _studium vigere_\r\n contigerit” (1264), and the words in Alan Bassett’s bequest for\r\n monastic scholars at Oxford or elsewhere _ubi studium fuerit\r\n universitatis_ (1233).\r\n\r\n [125] See also p. 86 footnote.\r\n\r\n [126] The proportion of priests among the fellows (_i.e._ scholars on\r\n the foundation) was to be 6 in 30, 4 in 20, 2 in 12. See also pp. 152\r\n and 153.\r\n\r\n [127] Cf. King’s Hall, p. 132.\r\n\r\n [128] The xv c. library at Pembroke was over the hall; the older\r\n library of the same date at Peterhouse was next the hall.\r\n\r\n [129] The earliest of these features appears at Pembroke, which had a\r\n treasury. For the combination room see p. 135 and iv. p. 214. For the\r\n gateway, p. 140. For students’ studies, iv. p. 232 _n._\r\n\r\n [130] Cf. Peterhouse p. 56. The Christian church evolved in Rome no\r\n doubt originated in the domestic _aula_, the basilica, of a great\r\n private house, and was surrounded by those dwelling-rooms which\r\n constituted the first _titulus_ or _domus ecclesiae_. So at Cambridge\r\n we have a _domus collegii_, and _domus vel aula scholarium_ sancti\r\n Michaelis or Clarae.\r\n\r\n [131] After the founder’s death two rectors were to exercise complete\r\n jurisdiction, one of these was to be a secular graduate but the other\r\n is to be a Franciscan. Moreover the fellows of the college were “to\r\n give their best counsel and aid” to the abbess and sisters of Denney\r\n abbey who had from the founder “a common origin with them.” For\r\n Denney, see i. p. 25, 25 _n._\r\n\r\n [132] _Notabile et insigne et quam pretiosum collegium quod inter\r\n omnia loca universitatis ... mirabiliter splendet et semper\r\n resplenduit._\r\n\r\n [133] Spenser entered as a sizar.\r\n\r\n [134] Gray left Peterhouse on account of some horseplay on the part of\r\n its students who raised a cry of fire which brought him out of bed and\r\n down from his window overlooking Little S. Mary’s church in an escape\r\n which his dread of fire had induced him to contrive. Of his treatment\r\n at Pembroke he writes that it was such as might have been extended to\r\n “Mary de Valence in person.”\r\n\r\n [135] Pitt in introducing his son to the college writes: “Such as he\r\n is, I am happy to place him at Pembroke; and I need not say how much\r\n of his parents’ hearts goes along with him.” (Letter to the Senior\r\n tutor of the college, 1767.)\r\n\r\n [136] He was afterwards fellow of Trinity Hall, and Spenser dedicates\r\n one of the Eclogues to him there.\r\n\r\n [137] See Trinity Hall, p. 80.\r\n\r\n [138] The asterisks denote Masters of the College. Whitgift migrated\r\n from Queens’ to Pembroke, and was subsequently fellow of Peterhouse\r\n and Master of Pembroke. Langton of Winchester was a fellow.\r\n\r\n [139] pp. 27 and 96.\r\n\r\n [140] v. p. 275.\r\n\r\n [141] Reyner D’Aubeney and Robert Stanton.\r\n\r\n [142] p. 68 _n._\r\n\r\n [143] Alcock himself, by a unique arrangement made with Rotherham,\r\n held the Seals conjointly with that prelate, then Bishop of Lincoln,\r\n from April to September 1474; and he had acted in parliament in\r\n the same capacity for Stillington in 1472. Merton whose Cambridge\r\n operations were described in the last chapter was Lord Chancellor;\r\n so was Sir Robert Thorpe who began the Schools, and so were Booth\r\n and Rotherham who completed the Schools quadrangle and built the old\r\n library. John Somerset, who was chiefly instrumental in the founding\r\n of King’s College, was Chancellor of the Exchequer to Henry VI.\r\n\r\n [144] Cf. nationality of founders of colleges p. 150.\r\n\r\n [145] The stone house (p. 24 _n._) and John Goldcorn’s property--all\r\n opposite Michaelhouse--were then fashioned by Bateman, after the\r\n founder’s demise, as Gonville Hall.\r\n\r\n [146] See Gonville and Caius, pp. 143-4.\r\n\r\n [147] Twelve preachers from each university were annually licensed for\r\n any diocese in England. Gonville was now allowed two such licences on\r\n its own account.\r\n\r\n [148] p. 141.\r\n\r\n [149] He landed at Yarmouth in June, and the charter of foundation is\r\n dated November 20.\r\n\r\n [150] Magdalene, p. 127.\r\n\r\n [151] The style “the keeper and scholars of the college of the Holy\r\n Trinity of Norwich,” reminds us that the original dedication of this\r\n and Gonville corresponds to that of two of the ancient Cambridge\r\n guilds--the Holy Trinity and the Annunciation.\r\n\r\n [152] The N.E. corner was obtained four years after the foundation by\r\n the purchase of a house at the corner of Henney Lane.\r\n\r\n [153] See also King’s.\r\n\r\n [154] See also Caius.\r\n\r\n [155] Account given of the building of Corpus by Archbishop Parker’s\r\n Latin secretary, John Jocelyn, fellow of Queens’. It is supposed that\r\n the hall of the guild of Corpus Christi was near the old court; S.\r\n Mary’s guild met at the hostel of that name near the present Senate\r\n House. See also p. 83.\r\n\r\n [156] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n [157] The brethren and sisters of the two guilds presumably thus taxed\r\n all house property bequeathed by them to their college, to defray\r\n the expenses of the wax lights so freely used in funeral and other\r\n liturgical rites. It has been pointed out that the riots occurred two\r\n days after the feast of Corpus Christi, with its recent procession in\r\n England, the contribution of wax tapers for which may have greatly\r\n aggravated the grievance. The feast is of xiii c. origin, the outdoor\r\n procession dates from the late xivth.\r\n\r\n [158] She was heiress to her sister Eleanor who had been betrothed to\r\n Edward IV. They were the daughters of John Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury,\r\n and Elizabeth’s only child Ann was wife to Richard of York murdered in\r\n the Tower.\r\n\r\n [159] The dearth of clerks or clergy and the failure of learning: the\r\n former engaged the attention of the founders of Gonville, Trinity\r\n Hall, and Corpus, the latter of the founder of Clare who writes: “to\r\n promote ... the extension of these sciences, which by reason of the\r\n pestilence having swept away a multitude of men, are now beginning to\r\n fail rapidly.”\r\n\r\n [160] The fact that we have a guild college built in Cambridge is\r\n especially interesting, for, as Dr. Stubbs has shown, Cambridge\r\n ranks highest among English towns for its guild history. Even the\r\n Exeter statutes do not rival those of one of its ancient guilds\r\n which united the craft or religious guild with the frith-guild--the\r\n guild instituted for the religious interests of its members or\r\n to protect craftsmen and their craft, and the guild which was an\r\n attempt “on the part of the public authorities to supplement the\r\n defective execution of the law by measures for mutual defence.” The\r\n Cambridge statutes, in fact, show us the guild as an element in\r\n the development of the township or burgh, one of those communities\r\n within a community which was the earliest expedient of civilisation,\r\n the earliest essay in organisation, everywhere. The guild which\r\n combined these two institutions was a thanes guild. It made and\r\n enforced legal enactments; it paid the blood-money if a member slew\r\n a man with righteous cause, and exacted eight pounds from any one\r\n who robbed a member. “It is improbable” writes Dr. Stubbs “that\r\n any institution on so large a scale existed in any other town than\r\n London.” In Athelstan’s reign we have a complete code of such a London\r\n frith-guild. (_Constitutional History of England_, vol. i. p. 414.)\r\n\r\n It is against this historic background that we find the guilds\r\n of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin uniting to add a common\r\n scholastic interest to interests civil and religious, by founding a\r\n college. The guilds were lay institutions; in two of the best known\r\n Cambridge guilds priests were either excluded, or, if admitted, denied\r\n a share in the government; and a chaplain for the guild of the Blessed\r\n Virgin was only to be maintained if the necessary assistance to the\r\n poorer members permitted of it.\r\n\r\n [161]\r\n\r\n    “Thus of Cambridge the name gan first shyne\r\n     As chieffe schoole and vniuersitie\r\n     Vnto this tyme fro the daye it began”\r\n\r\n\r\n [162] The “good duke of Lancaster” was Alderman of the Guild of Corpus\r\n Christi. John of Gaunt greatly befriended the college. It was _anno\r\n 1356_ that the “translation of the college of Corpus Christi out of\r\n lay hand to the patronage of the duke of Lancaster,” took place; a\r\n document so entitled once formed part of the Registry MSS.\r\n\r\n [163] Augustinians never enjoyed their habit in comfort; in the xiii\r\n c. they were obliged to make their leather girdle long and their tunic\r\n short because they were suspected of a desire to pass as corded and\r\n sandalled Franciscans, and to cover over their white tunic with black\r\n in the streets lest they should be taken for friars preachers.\r\n\r\n [164] pp. 127, 128 _n._, and p. 143, 143 _n._\r\n\r\n [165] _Recorda et placita coram cancellario Ric. le Scrope in le\r\n Tollebouth. 2 Ric. II. 1378-9._ MS. No. 49 in the Cambridge Registry.\r\n\r\n [166] Stephen le Scrope was chancellor in 1400 and 1414, Richard\r\n Scroop (who had been Master of King’s Hall) in 1461, and Lady Anne\r\n Scroope was one of the early benefactors of Gonville’s hall; see vi.\r\n p. 325, 325 _n._\r\n\r\n [167] Edward himself speaks of it as “so important a college” in 1342.\r\n See p. 132. Since going to press I see that Mr. Rouse Ball identifies\r\n King’s Hall as ‘Solar Hall’ in his monograph on Trinity College,\r\n published in March 1906. Prof. Willis conjectured that ‘Solar Hall’ =\r\n Garrett Hostel.\r\n\r\n [168] King’s Hall statutes name 14 as the age.\r\n\r\n It will be remembered that Pembroke, Clare, Corpus, and King’s Hall\r\n were all directly or indirectly connected with the reigning house. For\r\n the group of great names connected with Edward’s household and with\r\n Cambridge at this time cf. v. pp. 291-295.\r\n\r\n [169] The main artery of the xiv and xv century university was not, as\r\n now, the High street, but the Mill street (Milne street). It lay in a\r\n direct line between Clare Hall and Queens’ Lane, and 7 colleges had\r\n their entrances on it: Michaelhouse, Trinity Hall, Clare, old King’s\r\n College, S. Catherine’s, and Queens’. Gonville was approached from\r\n the north end, and King’s Hall lay on the same side. The church and\r\n property of the Knights of S. John and Garret’s and Ovyng’s hostels\r\n were in the same street. Mill street began at Queens’ Lane, and led\r\n northwards from the King’s and the Bishop’s Mills, which gave it its\r\n name. The larger part was alienated in 1445 to build the second King’s\r\n College.\r\n\r\n Another characteristic feature of old Cambridge was the _King’s\r\n Ditch_ made by Henry III. in 1267, which starting from Castle Mound,\r\n with a walk beside it, formed the western boundary of King’s Hall,\r\n Michaelhouse, and Trinity Hall, and polluted the water supply of\r\n Peterhouse even in Andrew Perne’s time.\r\n\r\n [170] Temp. Laurence Booth, chancellor.\r\n\r\n [171] See Loggan’s print, 1688. The great schools in the School street\r\n are first mentioned 1346-7. The divinity schools were the first to\r\n be completed, by Sir _William_ Thorpe’s executors, in 1398. The\r\n quadrangle was completed _c._ 1475. The eastern front was rebuilt in\r\n 1755. The buildings lie under the present library and are now used\r\n for the keeping of “acts” and for discussions, but not for lectures\r\n in the various faculties. The new Divinity schools are in S. John’s\r\n street, and were erected by friends as a memorial of Bishop Selwyn.\r\n The Science schools, school of Human Anatomy, chemical laboratories,\r\n etc. are on the site of the university botanical garden which was once\r\n Austinfriars’ property.\r\n\r\n [172] The room where these were treasured was the _libraria communis_\r\n or _magna_ (in the time of Caius the “old” or “public” library), which\r\n still exists on the south side, with Chancellor Rotherham’s library on\r\n the east. The ancient two-storeyed building on the west which existed\r\n as early as 1438 still contains the old Canon Law (now the Arts)\r\n school, with the original library and the university chapel (disused\r\n for centuries) above (p. 97).\r\n\r\n [173] Fuller and Caius both record this fact.\r\n\r\n [174] It consists of 700 MSS. and 30,000 volumes. Other and earlier\r\n benefactors to the library were Perne (1574), Fulke Greville, Stephen\r\n Perse of Caius, and George Villiers Duke of Buckingham.\r\n\r\n There is a library “Chest” and endowments, amounting to about £2000,\r\n plus the income of £4500 from the common university Fund.\r\n\r\n [175] A copy of every book and pamphlet published in England is sent\r\n here, to the British Museum, and to the Bodleian.\r\n\r\n [176] The printing of bibles and of the Book of Common Prayer is still\r\n confined to the king’s printer and the 2 universities. Until 1779 the\r\n printing of almanacks was also restricted to the universities and the\r\n Stationers’ Company.\r\n\r\n [177] See iii. p. 183, and iv. p. 205.\r\n\r\n [178] Cf. the laying of the foundation stone of the Norman church of\r\n S. Giles in 1092, when Anselm of Canterbury and the Bishop of Lincoln\r\n (then the diocesan) were present.\r\n\r\n [179] In 1439. Its site was the present ante-chapel, see Christ’s\r\n College p. 117.\r\n\r\n [180] The king’s design did not at first include the connexion of Eton\r\n and King’s. The foundations of a college and chapel for a rector and\r\n 12 scholars were first laid opposite Clare, between Mill Street and\r\n the Schools, on April 2, 1441. Within three years this foundation was\r\n changed into a society which, like Eton, is under a Provost and which\r\n was bound to provide the free education of poor Etonians. Here Henry\r\n imitated William of Wykeham, and the statutes which he drew up follow\r\n the lines laid down by the founder of Winchester and New College. The\r\n original “mean quadrant” was used till 1828 when it was sold to the\r\n university for the library extension on that side. The chapel fell\r\n down in 1536. A wall and gateway on the west, remain. The new design\r\n had the original court and Clare on the north, Austin’s hostel and\r\n Whitefriars on the south: the chapel was to form the north side of a\r\n quadrangle measuring 230 × 238 feet (cf. the measurements of Corpus);\r\n and, as in previous colleges, the west side was to contain the hall\r\n and provost’s lodging, a library and lecture rooms. The south and\r\n east sides were to be for the chambers and the latter was to have a\r\n gateway and tower. The present Queens’ College is on the site of the\r\n Whitefriars’ house; and the old gate of King’s which led from the\r\n chapel yard to Queens’ Lane used to be known as “Friars’ gate.” (For a\r\n full account of this most interesting design the reader is referred to\r\n Messrs. Willis and Clark’s book.)\r\n\r\n For the modern buildings four _separate_ ranges were designed, the\r\n first to be erected being the Gibbs’ building on the west: the\r\n southern side and the screen have been built since 1824, Wilkins\r\n being the architect; on this side are the hall, combination room,\r\n and library, and the Provost’s lodge. Sir Gilbert Scott erected the\r\n building on the south east, which was projected after 1870.\r\n\r\n [181] The Norfolk name of Boleyn is found at the university in the\r\n xv c. Henry Boleyn was proctor in 1454-5, and Anne’s uncle was\r\n churchwarden of S. Clement’s.\r\n\r\n [182] It has been suggested that Tudor architecture might be styled\r\n Heraldic architecture, so freely does heraldry and blazonry enter into\r\n its plan and the scheme of decoration. England’s two great specimens\r\n of the Perpendicular--King’s College chapel and Henry VII.’s chapel\r\n at Westminster--are pervaded by a “gorgeous display of heraldry.” The\r\n west and south entrances of King’s are decorated with bold carvings of\r\n the badges of Henry VII.--the crowned rose and portcullis. “No person\r\n ever glanced his eye over the wonders around and above him, without\r\n being awestruck at the daring of the architect that could plan, and\r\n the builders that could erect such a structure. The whole of the\r\n lower part of the Chapel beneath the windows is divided into panels,\r\n and every panel is filled with the arms of the king who erected the\r\n building.” “The immense pendants hanging from the gorgeous roof are\r\n ornamented with the rose, the royal badge of both the king and queen\r\n at this period.” (Clark’s _Introduction to Heraldry_, edited by J. R.\r\n Planché, Rouge Croix.) The arms and supporters of Eton, Henry VI. and\r\n VIII., Richard II., Edward IV. and VIth, Mary and Elizabeth, appear\r\n also. The gateway towers of Christ’s and John’s afford other examples\r\n of heraldic display as the exclusive scheme of decoration--they bear\r\n the arms, supporters, and badges of their founder, the mother of Henry\r\n VII. Finally the Entrance Gateway tower of Trinity exhibits the arms\r\n of Edward III. and his six sons (William of Hatfield being represented\r\n by a blank shield); above is a statue of Henry VIII. No street--no\r\n town--in England presents anything like this “boast of heraldry” which\r\n Gray had always under his eyes in Cambridge. It is a permanent record\r\n of the two royal groups in England who preferred this university; the\r\n gateway at Trinity being the _trait d’union_ between them.\r\n\r\n [183] “The scholars of King’s enjoyed the questionable privilege of\r\n drifting into their degrees without examination. Lectures and rare\r\n compositions in Latin were the only demands upon their time,” writes\r\n Lord Stratford de Redcliffe. The same arrangements obtained at New\r\n College Oxford until 50 years ago.\r\n\r\n [184] The “13 poor men” who are to form part of the foundation at\r\n Eton are an addition of Henry’s own; they do not appear on Wykeham’s\r\n foundation.\r\n\r\n [185] For the Days, see v. p. 273 _n._ Wickham was vice-provost of\r\n Eton.\r\n\r\n [186] Somerset returned to Cambridge in later life, after he had\r\n fallen into disgrace and poverty, and met, like Metcalfe of John’s,\r\n with small gratitude. Dr. Philip Baker, though a Catholic, retained\r\n the provostship under Elizabeth till 1570. For King’s men see also pp.\r\n 174-5, 272-3-4 _n._, 283.\r\n\r\n [187] Eton is the only public school joined from its foundation with\r\n a Cambridge college. Merchant Taylors’ used however to be related to\r\n Pembroke (which owes Spenser’s presence there to this circumstance)\r\n and the ancient school of Bury used, it is said, to send its _alumni_\r\n to Gonville. S. Paul’s school has tied scholarships and exhibitions at\r\n Corpus Christi and Trinity: Corpus was connected with Norwich school\r\n and Norfolk by Bacon, Parker, and other Norfolk benefactors, and has\r\n tied scholarships with King’s School, Canterbury, and Westminster;\r\n the last being also closely connected with Trinity College. Harrow\r\n has two tied scholarships at Caius; Magdalene holds the Latimer\r\n Neville scholarships for Shrewsbury, Marlborough, Uppingham, and\r\n Fettes schools, and tied exhibitions from Wisbech school. Uppingham\r\n is similarly connected with Emmanuel; Peterhouse with Huntingdon Free\r\n Grammar School, and S. John’s with 18 schools all over England and\r\n with several towns as well.\r\n\r\n [188] A chapel of S. Lucy (erected 1245) came into the possession of\r\n Peterhouse with the property of the friars of the Sack (1309) and was\r\n used by the fellows towards the end of that century. The licences\r\n obtained by Bateman (1352 and 1353) for chapels in Trinity Hall and\r\n Gonville were never acted upon. Gonville however had a house chapel\r\n in 1393. At this date Clare also had a chapel, which was used at the\r\n primate’s visitation in 1401. The Clare Statutes (1359) direct that S.\r\n John Baptist’s church be used. For ritual in the college chapels, see\r\n pp. 59, 145. Organs were placed in most of the chapels in the reign of\r\n Charles I., at a time when the courts, gates, and frontage of colleges\r\n underwent repair and decoration.\r\n\r\n [189] Cf. with the dimensions of Corpus old court which was\r\n considerably larger (220 by 140), of the proposed quadrangle at King’s\r\n p. 102 _n._, and with the frontage of some of the hostels p. 50.\r\n\r\n [190] Haddon Hall in Derbyshire; the first owners of which were those\r\n Peverels (”of the Peak”) who figure in Cambridge history at the time\r\n of the Conquest (i. p. 17). The house passed to the Bassetts, a name\r\n which was also well known in the university; and from there--so the\r\n old story runs--Dorothy Vernon, a daughter of the last owners of the\r\n manor, ran away with Sir John the first Lord Manners.\r\n\r\n [191] For the marriage of a xvi c. President of Queens’, see iv. pp.\r\n 209, 212.\r\n\r\n [192] Pearson was educated here, then at King’s of which he became\r\n fellow, and was Master of Jesus and, in 1662, of Trinity.\r\n\r\n [193] See Bernard’s hostel p. 109.\r\n\r\n [194] Margaret had however called it “the quenes collage of sainte\r\n Margarete and S. Bernard.” In her petition for a charter she tells the\r\n king: “in the whiche vniuersitie is no college founded by eny quene of\r\n Englond hidertoward.” The statutes were drawn up by Millington first\r\n Provost of King’s, and others.\r\n\r\n [195] Accounts of King’s Hall. Here, too, the king was to have been\r\n lodged for the parliament of 1447.\r\n\r\n [196] Henry VII. was on his way to the same celebrated shrine when he\r\n came to Cambridge in 1506.\r\n\r\n [197] He was at S. John’s Oxford, which he left without his degree.\r\n\r\n [198] “Hall of S. Katerine,” the only foundation since King’s College\r\n founded as a _hall_ not a _college_.\r\n\r\n [199] Willis and Clark.\r\n\r\n [200] It was the gift of Malcolm “the Maiden” of Scotland. The\r\n monastery was much enlarged and enriched by him _circa_ 1160. Dugdale\r\n dates the house to the middle of Stephen’s reign or perhaps as early\r\n as 1130. In the xiii c. Constantia wife to Earl Eustace granted to the\r\n nuns all the fisheries and water belonging to the town of Cambridge,\r\n and the convent at that time shared with the canons of S. John’s and\r\n the Merton scholars the fame of being the greatest landlords in the\r\n town. See i. pp. 16, 18 and 36 _n._, vi. p. 311 and ii. p. 109. On a\r\n stone by the south-eastern corner of the south transept in the church\r\n there is this inscription (A.D. 1261):\r\n\r\n          _Moribus ornata\r\n    Facet hic bona Berta Rosata._\r\n\r\n\r\n [201] Fuller.\r\n\r\n [202] See iii. p. 165 _n._ Dyer points out that William Byngham is\r\n called “proctor and Master of God’s House,” but not founder: he\r\n considers that Hen. VI. was the founder, Byngham being its procurator\r\n as Doket was procurator of Queens’ and Somerset of King’s colleges.\r\n The facts recorded here and in chap. iii. appear to support this\r\n conclusion. At the same time Byngham in his letter to the king in\r\n 1439 distinctly claims to have built the house: “Goddeshous the which\r\n he hath made and edified in your towne of Cambridge.” In the case\r\n of every Cambridge college the founder is the man who endows it. A\r\n college may owe its existence (as certainly in Byngham’s case) to the\r\n energies of some one else, but its founder remains the man by whom\r\n it was built and endowed. A God’s House at Ewelme in Oxfordshire was\r\n founded about the same time by William de la Pole and Alice his wife,\r\n Earl and Countess of Suffolk. “It is still in being,” writes Tanner,\r\n “but the Mastership is annexed to the King’s professor of Physic in\r\n the university of Oxford.” A God’s house was an almshouse for some\r\n object of mercy. Thirteen poor men were maintained at Ewelme.\r\n\r\n [203] Founder of Emmanuel College. Fuller says he was “a serious\r\n student in” and benefactor of this college.\r\n\r\n [204] Refer to iv. p. 217 _n._\r\n\r\n [205] p. 153, iii. p. 165 _n._\r\n\r\n [206] She diverted some of her gifts to Henry VII.’s chapel at\r\n Westminster, with the king’s consent, in favour of S. John’s College\r\n Cambridge.\r\n\r\n [207] “Fryvelous things, that were lytell to be regarded, she wold let\r\n pass by, but the other that were of weyght and substance, wherein she\r\n might proufyte, she wolde not let for any payne or labour, to take\r\n upon hande. All Englonde for her dethe had cause of wepynge ... the\r\n students of both the unyversytees, to whom she was as a moder; all the\r\n learned men of Englonde, to whom she was a veray patroness ... all the\r\n noblemen and women to whom she was a myrroure and exampler of honoure;\r\n all the comyn people of this realme, for whom she was in their cause a\r\n comyn medyatryce, and toke right grete displeasure for them.”\r\n\r\n Fisher was created cardinal priest of S. Vitalis, in the modern Via\r\n Nazionale (the ancient _titulus Vestinae_) by Paul III. When Henry\r\n VIII. heard that the Hat had been conferred, he exclaimed that he\r\n would not leave the bishop a head to wear it on. The following prayer\r\n appears in the Roman breviary for the feast day of Blessed John\r\n Fisher (June 22):--_Deus, qui beato pontifici tuo Joanni pro veritate\r\n et justitia magno animo vitam profundere tribuisti; da nobis ejus\r\n intercessione et exemplo; vitam nostram pro Christo in hoc mundo\r\n perdere, ut eam in coelo invenire valeamus._\r\n\r\n “The most inflexibly honest churchman who held a high station in that\r\n age.“--Hallam. Fisher was confessor to Catherine of Aragon and to Lady\r\n Margaret.\r\n\r\n [208] See i. 38; ii. 55-6. An old Ely Chartulary says: “Henry Frost\r\n ought never to be forgot, who gave birth to so noted a seat of\r\n religion, and afterwards to one of the most renowned seats of learning\r\n in Europe.”\r\n\r\n [209] _History of the College of S.

John’s, but whom “the young fry of fellows” combined to oust in\r\n 1534. “Did not all the bricks of the college that day double their dye\r\n of redness to blush at the ingratitude of those that dwelt therein?”\r\n (Fuller.)\r\n\r\n [216] He was buried by the side of Sir Thomas More in the chapel of S.\r\n Peter ad Vincula in the Tower.\r\n\r\n [217] Constitutions for the reform of the Black Benedictine,\r\n Cistercian, and Augustinian Orders, issued in 1335, 1337, 1339.\r\n\r\n [218] i. p. 27. The university for English and Irish monks provided by\r\n papal authority and by the Cistercian Constitutions was Oxford. The\r\n licence for Monks’ hostel Cambridge stipulates that all monks of the\r\n order of S. Benedict in England or in other the king’s dominions shall\r\n henceforth dwell there together during the university course. There\r\n was a small recrudescence of monastic studies in Cambridge in the xiv\r\n c. when Ely hostel was built, and from this time forward 3 or 4 Ely\r\n monks were regularly to be found pursuing the university course there\r\n (Testimony of John of Sudbury, prior of students, at the Northampton\r\n chapter in 1426). But there was no prior of students at Cambridge till\r\n towards the end of that century; Ely hostel itself was dismantled\r\n before the middle of the century; the black monks of Norwich however\r\n came to Cambridge under Bateman’s influence with what the bull of\r\n Sixtus IV. 150 years later shows to have been considerable constancy.\r\n See Caius pp. 143-4, 144 _n._\r\n\r\n [219] Chambers for Crowland were built by its abbot John of Wisbeach\r\n in 1476. John de Bardenay had preceded John of Sudbury as prior of\r\n Benedictines in 1423, and both were probably Crowland monks.\r\n\r\n [220] Dugdale. When Charles V. heard that Stafford Duke of Buckingham\r\n had been beheaded through the machinations of the butcher’s son\r\n Wolsey, he exclaimed: “A butcher’s dog has killed the fairest buck in\r\n England!”\r\n\r\n [221] It is clear from the masonry of the chapel that this was\r\n anterior to the college of 1519. See Willis and Clark ii. 362, 364.\r\n\r\n [222] Corpus hall is the only one in Cambridge not provided with a\r\n musicians’ gallery.\r\n\r\n [223] The retired position of the earlier college had been, he held,\r\n a salutary assistance to study: it “stood on the transcantine side,\r\n an anchoret in itself, severed by the river from the rest of the\r\n university.”\r\n\r\n [224] Fuller and Carter say the college site was purchased by the\r\n convents of Ely, Ramsey, and Walden. Cf. p. 128.\r\n\r\n [225] Grindal is a good instance of a migrating student: he entered at\r\n Magdalene, and subsequently migrated to Christ’s and Pembroke, where\r\n he became fellow and Master.\r\n\r\n [226] The university statute providing for the commemoration of\r\n benefactors and others, directs that mass be said every 5th of May for\r\n Edward II. as founder of King’s Hall.\r\n\r\n [227] Which is on the site of the hall, pulled down in 1557 to make\r\n room for the chapel.\r\n\r\n [228] For changes made in the Mill Street district in the xv c. when\r\n the School’s Quadrangle and King’s College were built, cf. pp. 24, 24\r\n _n._, 25 _n._, 97 _n._, 101.\r\n\r\n [229] There was a fellows’ “parloure” in King’s Hall as early as\r\n 1423-4.\r\n\r\n [230] There is a fine series of most valuable portraits in the Lodge;\r\n among them one of Mary, and the standing portrait of the young Henry\r\n VIII. which Wordsworth made the subject of a poem. A careful list of\r\n university portraits appears at the end of Atkinson’s volume, but\r\n such a list--useful and valuable as it is--tucked away somewhere in a\r\n book on Cambridge is not an adequate homage to so important a source\r\n of university history as these portraits. The loan exhibition at the\r\n Fitzwilliam Museum in 1884-5 was the first attempt to collect the\r\n Cambridge pictures: the example was followed by Oxford in 1904-6, and\r\n the Catalogue of portraits then published is a model of what can and\r\n should be done.\r\n\r\n No complete list of the portraits of either university, however, at\r\n present exists. Many canvasses remain unidentified or misidentified;\r\n some are doubtless perishing for want of care, and the artist’s name\r\n has long disappeared from many more. The work therefore that remains\r\n to be done is a big one, but is eminently worth the doing.\r\n\r\n [231] A sedan coach is preserved in the entrance hall of Trinity\r\n Lodge, and is used to transport visitors from the Gateway to the Lodge\r\n when the Master entertains. It is the college tradition that the coach\r\n was presented by Mrs. Worsley, wife of the then Master of Downing,\r\n to Christopher Wordsworth Master of Trinity, and brother of the poet\r\n (1820-41).\r\n\r\n [232] This is the largest college library but it is not the most\r\n ancient. Peterhouse led the way in the xiii century with divinity and\r\n medicine books of Balsham’s. In 1418, 380 volumes were catalogued,\r\n containing “from six to seven hundred distinct treatises.” Here were\r\n to be found books on law, medicine, astrology, and natural philosophy,\r\n as well as the preponderating theological tomes. Trinity Hall was\r\n another famous xiv century library, and Pembroke has a catalogue of\r\n books in that and the next century amounting to 140 volumes. In the xv\r\n century Queens’ had 224, and S. Catherine’s 137 (in 1472 and 1475).\r\n In 1571 the French ambassador to this country deemed the library at\r\n Peterhouse “the worthiest in all England” Cf. the university library,\r\n p. 98.\r\n\r\n [233] His name appears in the House List of King’s Hall.\r\n\r\n [234] The tithes of Great S. Mary’s and Chesterton both belonged to\r\n King’s Hall, on which the advowson of S. Peter’s Northampton was\r\n bestowed, as Cherry Hinton had been bestowed on Peterhouse. The\r\n rectory of Chesterton, which had pertained till then to the monastery\r\n of Vercelli, was given by Eugenius IV.\r\n\r\n [235] Removed to its present position by Nevile in 1600; see p. 132.\r\n\r\n [236] p. 102 _n._\r\n\r\n [237] See p. 133.\r\n\r\n [238] Willis and Clark.\r\n\r\n [239] iii. p. 179.\r\n\r\n [240] iii. p. 174.\r\n\r\n [241] iii. p. 180.\r\n\r\n [242] Closed courts, however, continued to be built at Oxford; a late\r\n instance being the second court of S. John’s built by Laud so that his\r\n college should not be outshone by its Cambridge namesake.\r\n\r\n [243] Bull of Sixtus IV. 1481. The bull recites that in the time\r\n of William Bishop of Norwich the Norwich Benedictines had been\r\n accustomed to lodge at Gonville and Trinity Hall where Bateman had\r\n made convenient arrangements for them. When the pope proceeds to say\r\n that Benedict XI. had required all Benedictines who wished to study\r\n in Cambridge to live _in certo alio collegio dictae universitatis_,\r\n “deputed ad hoc,” he is mistaking the authorisation of Monks’ hostel\r\n 50 years before for the papal Constitution of 150 years before, as\r\n he mistakes Benedict XI. for Benedict XII. The suggestion that he\r\n refers to University Hall (the _hospicium universitatis_) is certainly\r\n erroneous: the words above quoted simply mean “in the said university”\r\n and not “the college called university college“: there was no such\r\n house for monks in Cambridge between 1347 and 1428, when “the college\r\n deputed in the said university ad hoc“--Monks’ College--was founded.\r\n Benedict’s Constitution does not specify whether the religious are to\r\n dwell in common, or not.\r\n\r\n [244] Cf. Magdalene, p. 127.\r\n\r\n [245] v. p. 286. Cudworth was afterwards Master of Clare, then of\r\n Christ’s; Whichcote became Provost of King’s.\r\n\r\n [246] p. 126.\r\n\r\n [247] The spot is marked by the black tombstone in the present\r\n farmyard, half way between Cambridge and Ely.\r\n\r\n [248] At her own request made to Louis XI.

The only Scotch benefactor was Malcolm the Maiden\r\n who endowed the nunnery of S. Rhadegund; but this was before colleges\r\n were built.\r\n\r\n [252] “_Ex omni dioecesi et qualibet parte hujus regni nostri Angliae,\r\n tam ex Wallia quam ex Hibernia._” There were, however, Scotchmen at\r\n Cambridge in the xiv c., i. p. 37.\r\n\r\n [253] To this day Pembroke fellowships are open to men “of any\r\n nation and any county,” whereas at other colleges (as e.g. Corpus)\r\n the restriction is to “any subjects of the king, wherever born.” Cf.\r\n Jebb’s “_Bentley_,” p. 92.\r\n\r\n [254] See divinity, canon and civil law, medicine, arts, and grammar\r\n in the next chapter, pp. 164-7.\r\n\r\n [255] To these must be added: insurance, rates, and taxes, repairs,\r\n legal expenses, printing, and stationery, gifts made by the\r\n university, and the _honorarium_ paid to the university preacher.\r\n\r\n [256] Fuller.\r\n\r\n [257] Magdalene, S. Catherine’s, Downing, Queens’, Peterhouse, Corpus,\r\n and Trinity Hall are the small and least wealthy colleges, and in this\r\n order. All the others have a gross income of over £10,000 a year. The\r\n income of all the colleges is published annually in Whitaker.\r\n\r\n [258] University College contributed £50.\r\n\r\n [259] See p. 167.\r\n\r\n [260] A man’s university and the faculty in which he has graduated are\r\n shown by the hood: the Cambridge master’s hood is black silk lined\r\n with white silk; the bachelor’s black stuff hood is trimmed with white\r\n rabbit fur. The doctors in the three faculties wear scarlet silk hoods\r\n lined with pink and violet shot silk (_D.D._), cherry silk (_LL.D._)\r\n and magenta silk (_M.D._).\r\n\r\n _B.D.’s_ wear a hood of black silk inside and out; _LL.M.’s_ wear an\r\n _M.A.’s_ hood; _LL.B.’s_, a _B.A.’s_ hood; _M.B.’s_ a black hood lined\r\n with scarlet.\r\n\r\n The _Mus.Doc._ wears a brocaded hood lined with cherry satin;\r\n _Mus.Bac._ black silk lined with cherry silk and trimmed with rabbit\r\n fur; _Litt.D._ scarlet silk inside and out; _D.Sc._ scarlet, lined\r\n with shot pink and light blue silk.\r\n\r\n [261] Thus the _knight bachelor_ is one enjoying the titular degree\r\n and rank of knighthood, without membership of any knightly order, to\r\n the companionship of which he is supposed to be an aspirant.\r\n\r\n [262] The study of sophistry or dialectic, which preceded Aristotle’s\r\n analytical logic.\r\n\r\n [263] Junior and senior sophister and bachelor: Fuller writing of\r\n Northampton says: “But this university never lived to commence\r\n Bachelor of Art, Senior Sophister was all the standing it attained\r\n unto. For, four years after,” etc.\r\n\r\n On tutors’ bills a century ago the style of _dominus_ was always\r\n given to bachelors, that of “Mr.” to masters; the undergraduate had\r\n to be content with “freshman” or “sophister.” The bachelors are still\r\n designated _dominus_ in the degree lists; a style which reminds us of\r\n the clerical “dan” of Chaucer’s time, and the Scotch “dominie” for a\r\n schoolmaster. For the degree ceremonies and processions see _Peacock_,\r\n _Appendix A_.\r\n\r\n [264] Regent: _regere_ like _legere_, to teach; cf. the _doctores\r\n legentes_ and _non-legentes_ of Bologna: _regere scholas_, and\r\n _officium regendi_ occur in Bury school records, xii c. (Brit. Mus.\r\n Add. MSS. 14,848, fol. 136). A congregation of the Cambridge masters,\r\n regents and non-regents, met in S. Mary’s church as early as 1275.\r\n\r\n [265] It must be realised that the degree in arts always differed\r\n from degrees in theology law and medicine inasmuch as these latter\r\n implied competence to exercise the corresponding professions. There\r\n was no such corresponding profession in the case of arts, except\r\n that of the schoolmaster. The clergyman, lawyer, or doctor at least\r\n exercised himself in these subjects, but the “artist” unless he was a\r\n regent-master, or a _magister scholarum_ elsewhere, left his studies\r\n when he left his university.\r\n\r\n [266] “The Tripos is a paper containing the names of the principal\r\n graduates for the year. It also contains 2 copies of verses written by\r\n two of the undergraduates, who are appointed to that employment by the\r\n proctors.“--Dyer. An extract from one of these sets of tripos verses\r\n is given in Dyer, _Hist. Camb._ ii. 89.\r\n\r\n [267] It was at this time that the moderators were substituted for the\r\n proctors, see p. 183.\r\n\r\n [268] pp. 168, 169.\r\n\r\n [269] Cf. p. 189, the lecture.\r\n\r\n [270] The derivation is Prof. Skeat’s.\r\n\r\n [271] The school of glomery was nourishing in 1452 (Ely Register\r\n _anno_ 1452); but a few years previously, when the statutes of King’s\r\n College were written, it was understood that grammar would be studied\r\n at Eton not at Cambridge. A century later (1549) the parliamentary\r\n commissioners introduced mathematics into the _trivium_ where it\r\n replaced grammar. A school of grammar existed at the university side\r\n by side with the school of glomery [see the provision for the teaching\r\n of grammar at God’s House (below) and Peterhouse and Clare p. 153 of\r\n the last chapter]. As late as 1500 there was a _magister grammaticae_\r\n and a _magister glomeriae_, who, _in ejus defectu_, is represented\r\n by proctors (_Stat. Cant._). “The Master of Grammar shall be browght\r\n by the Bedyll to the Place where the Master of Glomerye dwellyth, at\r\n iij of the Clocke, and the Master of Glomerye shall go before, and\r\n his eldest son nexte him.” A.D. 1591 (_Stokys in G.\r\n Peacock_). By Fuller’s time the master of glomery had ceased to exist.\r\n His work seems to have resembled the preparatory work of the Previous\r\n Examinations at the university to-day.\r\n\r\n In the Curteys Register of Bury-St.-Edmund’s (in the time\r\n of Abbot Sampson xii c.) we have the students of dialectic\r\n distinguished from the students of grammar and the latter from\r\n other scholars--“_dialecticos glomerellos seu discipulos_,” and\r\n “_glomerellos seu discipulos indistincte_”; surely a clear reference\r\n to two branches of the _trivium_. The use of the word _glomerel_ in\r\n O.E. law to signify an officer who adjusts disputes between scholars\r\n and townsmen, is obviously the result of a misinterpretation of\r\n Balsham’s rescript of 1276 “_Inprimis volumus et ordinamus quod\r\n magister glomeriae Cant. qui pro tempore fuerit, audiat et dicedat\r\n universas glomerellorum ex parte rea existentium.... Ita quod sive\r\n sint scholares sive laici qui glomerellos velint convenire ... per\r\n viam judicialis indaginis, hoc faciat coram magistro glomeriae...._”\r\n The form of the latter’s oath to the Archdeacon of Ely and the\r\n functions which fell to the master of glomery when the school became\r\n decadent, may also have led to the mistake (which was made by Spelman\r\n as regards the Cambridge glomerels). Cf. i. p. 14, iv. p. 207 _n._,\r\n and Fuller, Prickett-Wright Ed. pp. 52-4. The second of these editors,\r\n indeed, was the first to call attention (in 1840) to the irrefutable\r\n evidence in the Cole and Baker MSS. as to the meaning of master\r\n and school of glomery, and to light on the confirmation from the\r\n university of Orléans in the verses of the troubadour Rutebeuf. For\r\n glomery, see also _Peacock, Appendix A, xxxii-xxxvi_.\r\n\r\n The foundation of God’s House in 1439 was due to Parson Byngham’s\r\n zealous desire to remedy “the default and lack of scolemaisters of\r\n gramer,” following on the Black Death. In a touching letter to the\r\n king (Henry VI.) Byngham points out “how greatly the clergy of your\r\n realm is like to be empeired and febled” by the default, and relates\r\n that “over the est parte of the wey ledyng from Hampton” to Coventry\r\n alone, “and no ferther north yan Rypon,” _70 schools_ were empty\r\n for lack of teachers. “For all liberall sciences used in your seid\r\n universitees certein lyflode is ordeyned, savyng only for gramer.”\r\n\r\n [272] See chapter i. p. 33.\r\n\r\n [273] _Royal Injunctions_ to the university of 1535, requiring the\r\n denial of papal supremacy. “King Henry stung with the dilatory pleas\r\n of the canonists at Rome in point of his marriage, did in revenge\r\n destroy their whole hive throughout his own universities,” _Fuller_.\r\n The last Cambridge doctor in canon law “commenced” in this reign.\r\n\r\n [274] The usual course is to take the special medical examinations\r\n with the First Part of the natural sciences tripos. Sometimes however\r\n these are taken in addition to the ordinary _B.A._ degree. The last of\r\n the three _M.B._ examinations is divided into two parts, of which Part\r\n I. is taken at the end of the fourth year of medical study, and Part\r\n II. after six years, three of which must have been spent in medical\r\n and surgical practice and hospital work. The keeping of the “act” is\r\n not intended to be a mere form, and students are advised to prepare\r\n for it during the years of their hospital practice.\r\n\r\n [275] The degrees of bachelor of surgery (a registrable qualification)\r\n and master of surgery require no separate examination; the candidate\r\n must have done all that is required of a bachelor of medicine; but\r\n bachelors of surgery who are not also masters of arts cannot incept\r\n until three years have passed since they took the _B.C._, and masters\r\n of arts must have become legally qualified surgeons.\r\n\r\n [276] Whitgift’s thesis for the _D.D._ degree (1570) was “_Papa est\r\n ille anti-Christus_“--‘the pope is himself anti-Christ.’\r\n\r\n [277] _Erasm. Epist._ (London 1642), _Liber secundus, Epist. 10_.\r\n Letter to Bullock dated from the Palace at Rochester, August 31, 1516.\r\n\r\n [278] Or were relegated to the previous examinations.\r\n\r\n [279] Till then it had meant Aristotle: the statutes of Queens’ and\r\n Christ’s, framed within 50 years of one another, provide for its\r\n teaching--“the natural, moral, and _metaphysical_ philosophy of\r\n Aristotle”; and even in Fuller’s time these metaphysics were the study\r\n of the bachelor of arts: “Let a _sophister_ begin with his axioms, a\r\n _batchelor of art_ proceed to his _metaphysicks_, a _master_ to his\r\n _mathematicks_, and a _divine_ conclude with his _controversies_ and\r\n _comments_ on scripture....”\r\n\r\n Philosophy, meaning Aristotle, had come in to disturb the peace and\r\n the sufficiency of the old ‘seven arts.’\r\n\r\n [280] William Everett, _M.A._, 1865.\r\n\r\n [281] It has been said that senior wranglers are hidden in country\r\n rectories and are never heard of again. In a hundred and sixty years\r\n (1747-1906) there have been eight senior wranglers who could be placed\r\n in the first rank as mathematicians and physicists:\r\n\r\n  Herschell 1813\r\n  Airy 1823\r\n  Stokes 1841\r\n  Cayley 1842\r\n  Adams 1843\r\n  Todhunter 1848\r\n  Routh 1854\r\n  Rayleigh 1865\r\n\r\n Paley, in 1763, was the first distinguished senior wrangler. On the\r\n other hand Colenso Whewell and Lord Kelvin were second wranglers, so\r\n was the geometrician Sylvester; de Morgan and Pritchard were fourth\r\n wranglers; the learned Porteous was tenth wrangler, Lord Manners (Lord\r\n Chancellor of Ireland) was 5th, Lord Ellenborough (Lord Chief Justice)\r\n 3rd, Lord Lyndhurst (Lord Chancellor) second.\r\n\r\n [282] Another distinguished Oxonian, and East Anglian, Grosseteste,\r\n attempted in the xiii c. the re-introduction of Greek into England;\r\n but the foreign linguists whom he invited to St. Albans left no\r\n successors.\r\n\r\n [283] The west countryman Grocyn (b. 1442) who learnt his Greek in\r\n Italy and returned to teach it in Oxford was, chronologically, the\r\n first English classical scholar since the revival of learning.\r\n\r\n [284] “All students equally contributed to his” (Croke’s) “lectures,\r\n whether they heard or heard them not.” _Fuller_.\r\n\r\n [285] REVIVERS OF GREEK IN CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n [Sidenote: First period: Early patrons of Greek learning, and the\r\n group round Erasmus.]\r\n\r\n     1.

Perhaps at the bottom of the preference for English Latin\r\n there lies the notion that without it Latin would no longer be the\r\n English scholar’s second tongue. The simple retort is that with it\r\n Latin is no longer (has not been for centuries) a common medium, the\r\n second tongue, of European scholars. Anglicised Greek is due to Sir\r\n John Cheke and Sir Thomas Smith, though it was promptly abolished at\r\n the time by Stephen Gardiner then chancellor of the university, and\r\n opposed also by Caius. “Nor mattereth it if foreigners should dissent,\r\n seeing hereby we Englishmen shall understand one another,” so Fuller\r\n explains the position.\r\n\r\n [288] Paley continued to keep his traditional hold on Cambridge\r\n through the divinity paper in the “Little Go” which is based upon\r\n the “Evidences for Christianity.” On the other hand logic has\r\n recaptured the place which Aristotle held in the general curriculum\r\n by being admitted, since 1884, as the alternative subject for Paley’s\r\n “Evidences.”\r\n\r\n [289] Lord Maynard of Wicklow (S. John’s College) endowed a professor\r\n of logic at Cambridge in the reign of James I., with £40-50 a year.\r\n\r\n For university activity in philosophy in the xvii c. see chapter v.\r\n pp. 284-90.\r\n\r\n [290] One must not forget, however, that both the remarkable men who\r\n planted the study of the experimental sciences in Cambridge were\r\n distinguished ‘classics’ as well as scientists.\r\n\r\n [291] Letter of Vice-Chancellor Byng to Burleigh then chancellor of\r\n the university, 14 Dec. 1572, in which he advises him of a “greate\r\n oversighte of Dr. Caius” who had long kept “superstitious monuments\r\n in his college.” “I could hardly have been perswadid,” he continues,\r\n “that suche things by him had been reservid.”\r\n\r\n “Some since have sought to blast his memory by reporting him a papist;\r\n no great crime to such who consider the time when he was born, and\r\n foreign places wherein he was bred: however this I dare say in his\r\n just defence, he never mentioneth protestants, but with due respect,\r\n and sometimes, occasionally, doth condemn the superstitious credulity\r\n of popish miracles.... We leave the heat of his faith to God’s sole\r\n judgment, and the light of his good works to men’s imitation,” writes\r\n old Fuller.\r\n\r\n [292] Chairs of anatomy, botany, geology, and astronomy had been\r\n created in the first quarter of that century. See also Peterhouse p.\r\n 153.\r\n\r\n [293] For the natural sciences professorships, see pp. 190-92, and\r\n _n._ p. 192.\r\n\r\n [294] “In barb’rous Latin doom’d to wrangle” writes Byron of the\r\n Cambridge of his time.\r\n\r\n [295] The year is counted from the beginning of the academic year,\r\n _i.e._ Oct. 1747--the first degrees were taken in 1748.\r\n\r\n [296] A classified list of civil law graduates exists from the year\r\n 1815. There used to be a university _title S.C.L._ (Student of Civil\r\n Law) in relation to the civil law classes. The Act of 20-21 Vict.,\r\n disestablishing civil law in the courts, led to a revolution of law\r\n studies at Cambridge. From then dates the abolition of the old quaint\r\n ceremonies and disputations connected with this faculty.\r\n\r\n [297] From 1870, before the creation of the history tripos,\r\n examinations were conducted in a mixed law and history tripos.\r\n\r\n [298] Among educational reformers in the second half of the xviii\r\n c. Dr. John Jebb must not be omitted. To him is due the annual test\r\n examinations of tripos students called ‘the Mays,’ and perhaps also\r\n the “Little-Go.” He was a distinguished scientist, and member of\r\n Peterhouse.\r\n\r\n [299] Cf. chap. ii. p. 61 and chap. iv. p. 241.\r\n\r\n [300] “Poll,” οἱ πολλοἱ.\r\n\r\n [301] In 1835 Goulburn (afterwards Bishop of Trinidad) was second\r\n wrangler and senior classic; in 1828 Selwyn, another bishop, was\r\n senior classic and sixth wrangler. For the 2 triposes cf. iv. p. 238\r\n _n._\r\n\r\n [302] “Within 2-1/2 miles in a direct line” from Great S. Mary’s. For\r\n the academic year see iv. p. 241, and _n._ p. 182.\r\n\r\n [303] Part I. of most of the divided triposes entitles to the degree.\r\n Advanced and research students (p. 241) are entitled to the _B.A._\r\n and higher degrees after receiving a “certificate of research” and\r\n residing for 6 terms at the university.\r\n\r\n [304] The Previous Examination or “Little-Go,” as it is popularly\r\n called, consists of two parts, the first containing 5 papers on (_a_)\r\n one of the four Gospels in Greek (set book) (_b_) a Latin classic\r\n (set book) (_c_) a Greek classic (set book) (_d_) simple unprepared\r\n passages in Latin (_e_) simple Latin and Greek syntax. Since 1884\r\n a Greek or Latin classic may be substituted for the Greek Gospel.\r\n Part II., since June 1903, consists of 5 papers on (1) Paley’s\r\n Evidences, for which since 1884, elementary logic may be substituted\r\n (2) geometry (3) arithmetic (4) elementary algebra (5) subjects for\r\n an English essay from some standard English work or works. Until 1903\r\n the geometry paper was exclusively on Euclid’s lines, and required\r\n knowledge of the first three books and of parts of the vth and vith\r\n books. To qualify for admission to an ‘Honours’ examination a student\r\n must pass in certain subjects ‘additional’ to the ordinary Previous\r\n Examination. He is now allowed to choose between (1) additional\r\n Mathematics (Mechanics and Trigonometry) (2) French (3) German.\r\n\r\n A student must satisfy the examiners both as to grammar and\r\n orthography in answering the questions--a last relic of the grammar\r\n studies of the university!\r\n\r\n The General Examination, taken by those who read for the ordinary\r\n degree, includes (in Pt. I.) (1) a Greek classic (2) Latin classic\r\n (3) mechanics (4) simple trigonometry [(5) English passages for\r\n translation into Latin prose]. (Pt. II.) (1) The Acts of the Apostles\r\n in Greek (2) English history, selected period (3) subjects for an\r\n English essay, from the selected period (4) elementary hydrostatics\r\n and heat [(5) a paper on a Shakespeare play or on Milton’s works]. The\r\n 5th paper in each part is not obligatory.\r\n\r\n The Cambridge General Examination for the ordinary degree leaves much\r\n to be desired.\r\n\r\n The Special Examination for the ordinary degree may be in one of the\r\n following subjects: (_a_) _Theology_ (_b_) _Political Economy_ (_c_)\r\n _Law_ (_d_) _History_ (_e_) _Chemistry_ (_f_) _Physics_ (_g_) _Modern\r\n Languages_ (_h_) _Mathematics_ (_i_) _Classics_ (_k_) _Logic_ (_l_)\r\n _Geology_ (_m_) _Botany_ (_n_) _Zoology_ (_o_) _Physiology_ (_p_)\r\n _Mechanism and Applied Science_ (_q_) _Agricultural Science_ (_r_)\r\n _Music_. The standard for the subjects _k_, _l_, _m_, _n_, _o_, is\r\n that of the papers on those subjects in the first part of the moral\r\n and natural sciences triposes. The standard in the Theological Special\r\n examination may be judged from the following: Pt. I. (1) Outlines of\r\n O. T. history (2) a gospel in Greek [(3) history of the Jews from the\r\n close of O. T. history to the fall of Jerusalem]. Pt. II.

Edmund Spenser the poet and Lancelot Andrewes\r\n the scholar-bishop were both on the _aegrotat_ list of Pembroke\r\n College--in 1571--before, however, this necessarily implied absence\r\n from any of the university “acts.”\r\n\r\n [306] Since going to press, this change has been effected.\r\n\r\n [307] See chap. iv. p. 225.\r\n\r\n [308] This professorship was an expansion of the natural science\r\n lectureships founded by the great Linacre.\r\n\r\n [309] A chair of history was endowed by Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke,\r\n with £100 a year, in the reign of Charles I. It no longer exists.\r\n\r\n [310] A list of the professorships, with date of creation and\r\n emoluments, and of the readers and lecturers, appears in the\r\n University Calendar every year.\r\n\r\n There were no less than 7 chairs of medicine and natural science\r\n before 1851 when the tripos was created. The chairs existed, but with\r\n no scientific school to support them.\r\n\r\n [311] In 1524 the executors of Sir Robert Rede, Lord Chief Justice,\r\n endowed _tres liberae lecturae_ in humane letters, logic, and\r\n philosophy; and many distinguished men have been invited to deliver\r\n this annual lecture. The Hulsean lecture was founded in the xviii c.\r\n\r\n The first _exhibitions_ were founded in the xiii c. by Kilkenny, 9th\r\n Bishop of Ely, Balsham’s predecessor, for “2 priests studying divinity\r\n in Cambridge.”\r\n\r\n [312] Towards the end of the xv c. we have several instances of papal\r\n degrees conferred on members of religious orders which were followed\r\n by incorporation and full membership of Cambridge university. Thus\r\n _frater Steele_ “of Rome” was incorporated in 1492, and _frater\r\n Raddyng_ as a doctor five years later.\r\n\r\n [313] 1539 Eligius Ferrers, _D.D._; 1544 a Venetian _B.A. ad eundem_;\r\n 1559, _circa_, a _B.D._; 1615 an _M.A._ created _B.D._; 1617 the same;\r\n 1619 an _M.A._; 1635 the archdeacon of Essex _M.A._, is created _B.D._\r\n\r\n [314] Archbishop Sumner (1848-62) 120 degrees; Langley (1862-68) 46;\r\n Tait (1868-82) 101; Benson (1882-96) 55; Temple (1896-1903) 12.\r\n\r\n [315] Degrees in the 3 faculties are conferred without examination.\r\n Since Aug. 1858 degrees in medicine have carried with them no\r\n qualification to practise.\r\n\r\n All candidates for the _M.A._ must pass an examination in preliminary\r\n arithmetic, Greek gospels, and English language and literature: the\r\n two classical languages, modern languages, mathematics, mental and\r\n moral sciences, and the natural sciences, forming 6 subjects from\r\n which the candidate must choose two, and the standard enforced being\r\n “that of candidates for honours at the universities.” The Stamp Duty\r\n and other expenses reach at least £55.\r\n\r\n [316] An _ad eundem_ was given in 1501 to a Roman graduate by grace of\r\n the Senate.\r\n\r\n [317] See iv. p. 218.\r\n\r\n [318] Cf. ii. pp. 52-3.\r\n\r\n [319] The _cancellarius scholasticus_ of a cathedral chapter.\r\n\r\n [320] The earliest chancellor of whom we have a mention belongs to the\r\n year 1246 (_Baker MSS._). A list of chancellors exists from the year\r\n 1283, and is reprinted in Carter, _History of the University_. Among\r\n xiv c. chancellors belonging to great families, we have--\r\n\r\n  Stephen Segrave       1303-6\r\n  Richard le Scrope       1378\r\n  Guy de Zouche           1379\r\n  John de Cavendish       1380\r\n  John de Burgh           1385.\r\n\r\n See v. p. 307 _n._ The name recorded in 1246 is Hugo de Hottun\r\n (Hatton?).\r\n\r\n [321] By acts of the university 1504 and 1514.\r\n\r\n [322] Fuller places the first vice-chancellor in the year 1417, after\r\n Stephen le Scrope and Repingale Bishop of Chichester had held the\r\n chancellorship--1414 and 1415. Men “of great employment” began then to\r\n fill the position, and hence, he says, the necessity. 1454 is however\r\n the date of the earliest vice-chancellor usually given, and there\r\n were only intermittent appointments between then and 1500. In that\r\n year Richard Fox was chancellor, and Henry Babington vice-chancellor,\r\n and was succeeded in 1501 by John Fisher _who filled both offices_.\r\n In 1413 a friar was chosen as “president” of the university in the\r\n absence of Chancellor Billingford sent by Henry V. with the Bishop of\r\n Ely and the chancellor of the sister university to Rome.\r\n\r\n [323] In this body, which was created by act of 19th-20th Vict., are\r\n concentrated the powers of the houses of regents and non-regents, the\r\n ancient governing body of the university. Its 10 members are chosen\r\n from the roll.\r\n\r\n [324] The high steward is elected in the same way as the chancellor.\r\n He appoints a deputy who must be approved by the senate. The Cambridge\r\n high stewardship has been frequently held by favourites of the\r\n sovereign; Elizabeth gave it to Leicester, and Henry VII. to Empson.\r\n The present holder, Lord Walsingham, bears a name intimately connected\r\n with the history of the university.\r\n\r\n [325] At the last parliamentary election, January 1906, the university\r\n electorate numbered 6972.\r\n\r\n [326] The proctors are appointed according to a statutory cycle--they\r\n are nominated by the colleges in turn, two colleges nominating\r\n each year. The proctors at Oxford originally represented the north\r\n countrymen and the south countrymen. Entries of Cambridge proctors\r\n exist from 1350. The office, of course, is kin to that of the\r\n procurator of monastic orders; and the Cambridge proctors supervised\r\n Stourbridge fair, the markets, weights and measures, and all those\r\n matters which affected the supply of provisions for the university or\r\n its finances: to which were added their scholastic functions.\r\n\r\n [327] The first public orator was Richard Croke; Sir T. Smith, Sir J.\r\n Cheke, Roger Ascham, and George Herbert the poet, all held the office.\r\n Caius supposes that the master of glomery was university orator, whose\r\n duty it was to entertain princes and peers and to indite the epistles\r\n of the university on great occasions. He supposes also that as “senior\r\n regent” he collected and counted the suffrages in all congregations:\r\n the _Statutes_ however show us this officer in company with two\r\n _junior regents_ sorting the votes cast for the proctors. See also\r\n iii. p. 164 _n._\r\n\r\n [328] Thus a guild order in 1389 runs: the alderman “ssal sende forthe\r\n the bedel to alle the bretheren and the systeren.”\r\n\r\n [329] We find Archbishop Laud writing of Oxford: “If the university\r\n would bring in some bachelors of art to be yeomen-bedels ... they\r\n which thrived well and did good service might after be preferred to be\r\n esquire-bedels.”\r\n\r\n [330] The first esquire or armiger bedell on the Cambridge register is\r\n Physwick in the xiv c.; no one else is entered for this office till\r\n 1498 when Philip Morgan held it. After him there is another esquire\r\n bedell in 1500. The yeoman bedell probably stood in the same relation\r\n to the esquire bedell as the trumpeter to the herald. The herald did\r\n not blow his own trumpet and the esquire bedell of the university was\r\n doubtless not a macebearer. The original two bedells, nevertheless,\r\n used to go before the chancellor and masters _virgam deferentes_; and\r\n Balsham in 1275 arranges that _the bedell of the master of glomery_\r\n shall not carry his stave on these occasions, but only when on his\r\n superior’s own business. A bedell is mentioned in the xiii c. hostel\r\n statute referred to on p. 51.\r\n\r\n [331] Letter of Rennell to Stratford Canning, Nov. 16, 1807.\r\n\r\n [332] Until 1534 only those who had graduated doctor were elected to\r\n the office.\r\n\r\n [333] Principal (see vi. p. 339 _n._), warden, keeper, proctor, and\r\n rector are all titles which at one time or another were familiar in\r\n Cambridge.\r\n\r\n [334] In the xviii c. the colleges had already 4 lecturers in\r\n rhetoric, logic, ethics, and Greek. Cf. the provisions in the statutes\r\n of Christ’s College xvi c. The college _bursar_, the purse-bearer\r\n of his college, is its treasurer and oeconomus: a senior and junior\r\n bursar are appointed.\r\n\r\n [335] The decreasing value of the statutable stipends in the xvii c.\r\n led to the adoption (in 1630) of the new scale of payments.\r\n\r\n [336] He signed the university instrument which was presented to Henry\r\n renouncing the pope’s supremacy; Ridley, who was proctor at the time,\r\n signed after him.\r\n\r\n [337] From 1741 two chaplains were appointed in each college, to\r\n replace the fellows who before this used to take the chapel services\r\n in rotation. The Trinity College rule which provided that a fellow\r\n engaged in instruction in his college for ten years kept his\r\n fellowship for life or until he married, made the first rift in the\r\n obligation to take orders within a certain period after election, or\r\n forfeit the fellowship.\r\n\r\n [338] An American student, 20 years before the abolition of the\r\n Religious Test Act, was scandalised at the manner in which the\r\n reception of the sacrament was used as a mere condition for\r\n obtaining the certificate of fitness for orders. Men who had not\r\n made 3 communions in their college chapel during their stay, came\r\n up afterwards for the purpose, and received thereupon a document\r\n certifying that they had entirely satisfied “the vice-chancellor and\r\n the 8 senior fellows” of their fitness for their vocation.\r\n\r\n [339] In the same century Hobson, who died in 1630 at a great age,\r\n was the famous Cambridge carrier and kept the first livery stable in\r\n England. His numerous clients would find a large stable full of steeds\r\n from which “to choose” (with bridle whip and even boots provided); but\r\n everyone was expected to take the horse next the door: hence ‘Hobson’s\r\n choice,’ which has become an English household phrase, as has another\r\n Cantab expression, ‘constitutionalize’ for walking. Yet another phrase\r\n is ‘tawdry,’ the name given to the flimsy gaily coloured chains which\r\n were sold at Barnwell (now Midsummer) fair on the eve of S. Awdrey’s\r\n day. Hobson was immortalised by verses of Milton’s.\r\n\r\n [340] Colleges were not at first built for the ‘undergraduate.’ The\r\n scholar of the xiii, xiv, and xv centuries was the _socius_ (fellow)\r\n of to-day. His clerical position was that of a young man in minor\r\n orders, his scholastic that of a bachelor in art. He attended the\r\n schools of the doctors and masters, and was assisted by his fellowship\r\n and by exhibitions in the learned faculties to study for the degrees\r\n (master of art, and doctor in the faculties). The pensioner, who\r\n might or might not be an undergraduate in standing and who lived at\r\n his own charges, was provided for in the hostel. It was not till the\r\n visitation of 1401 that we find _socii_ and _scholares_ distinguished;\r\n and when King’s College was founded in the same half century its\r\n scholars were young students and nothing else. Nevertheless,\r\n although such was the original conception of the endowed college--at\r\n Peterhouse, Michaelhouse, Pembroke, Corpus--the later developments\r\n were outlined from the first. The bible clerks at Peterhouse were\r\n poor students not of the standing of bachelors, and a proviso in the\r\n statutes enabled the college to maintain “2 or 3 indigent scholars\r\n well grounded in grammar” when its funds shall permit. At Clare (1359)\r\n the sizar was regularly recognised. At Pembroke (1347) there were in\r\n addition to the “major scholars” 6 “minor scholars” who might fit\r\n themselves to be major scholars. At King’s Hall (Statutes Ric. II.)\r\n boys from 14 years old were admitted. At Christ’s (1505) the standing\r\n of the scholar was defined by requiring him to give instruction in\r\n sophistry; but the pensioner was contemplated for the first time as\r\n a regular inmate of the college. In fact the _perendinant_ who ate\r\n at the college tables became, before the middle of the xv c., the\r\n _commensalis_; the class being fully recognised 50 years later in the\r\n _convivae_ of Christ’s. There were no fewer than 778 _convivae_ or\r\n pensioners in the colleges in the time of Caius 1574.\r\n\r\n As to the age at which youths went up, it was not until the xix c.\r\n that the university was finally regarded as the complement to a full\r\n ‘college’ (public school) course elsewhere. The grammar boys at Clare\r\n and Peterhouse, the richer youths at King’s Hall, and the glomery\r\n students, must always have kept Cambridge peopled with little lads:\r\n but when grammar disappeared altogether (in the xvi c.) from the\r\n university curriculum, scholars continued to go up very young. In the\r\n xvi c. Wyatt went to S. John’s at 12, Bacon and his elder brother to\r\n Trinity at 12 and 14; Spenser was in his 16th year. In the xvii c.\r\n George Herbert was 15, so was Andrew Marvell, Milton had not attained\r\n his 15th year; Newton went to Trinity at 17, and Herschell to S.\r\n John’s at the same age. Pitt was a precocious exception in the xviii\r\n c. at 14.\r\n\r\n All the scholars of the early colleges were to be indigent; the one\r\n exception was King’s Hall, but the proviso appears again in the\r\n statutes for King’s College.\r\n\r\n We may note that All Souls’ Oxford retains the characteristic of the\r\n ancient college foundations, in being a college of fellows only. The\r\n title “students” for the fellows of Christchurch recalls the same\r\n intention.\r\n\r\n [341] When Gresham went to Gonville in Hen. VIII.’s time the\r\n fellow-commoner had just made his appearance. Cambridge was full of\r\n them in the reign of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n [342] Jeremy Taylor was a sizar, Newton and Bentley sub-sizars.\r\n\r\n [343] Statutes of Christ’s College.\r\n\r\n [344] The scholars of Eton were directed to recite the Matins of our\r\n Lady while making their beds.\r\n\r\n [345] This right was given up in 1856. The legal powers and privileges\r\n of the university date from the xiii c. and the reign of Henry III.:\r\n _Ita tamen quod ad suspensionem vel mutilationem clericorum non\r\n procedatis, sed eos alio modo per consilium universitatis Cantabr.\r\n castigetis_ is the clause inserted in 1261 in the matter of a quarrel\r\n between students from the north and south parts of the realm. The\r\n privileges granted to the university by Edward III. include the\r\n power of imprisoning offenders; and even the king’s writ could not\r\n be invoked to free them. In the 10th year of Edward’s reign the\r\n university chancellor maintained this right both over scholar and\r\n townsman. The oath taken by the mayor of Cambridge to maintain the\r\n “privileges liberties and customs of the university” dates from the\r\n same reign (when the mayor bailiffs and aldermen were obliged to swear\r\n to respect the chancellor’s rights). When the riots of 1381 led to a\r\n suspension of the town charter its privileges were transferred to the\r\n university, till the restoration of the charter in 1832.\r\n\r\n [346] The vice-chancellor’s court for persons _in statu pupillari_ is\r\n composed of the vice-chancellor and six heads of colleges elected by\r\n grace.\r\n\r\n [347] It will be observed that the academic dean possesses\r\n disciplinary functions like his predecessor and prototype the monastic\r\n dean. The academic dean is also the presiding official at the chapel\r\n services.\r\n\r\n [348] Undergraduates may not give entertainments in taverns or public\r\n halls without permission of their tutor: even then more than 5 men\r\n _in statu pupillari_ cannot meet together in a public place without a\r\n further permit from the proctor.\r\n\r\n It was agreed in 1856 that the licence of any ale house was liable to\r\n be revoked if a complaint in writing was made by the vice-chancellor\r\n to the Justices of the Peace.\r\n\r\n [349] Lodging house keepers sign a hard and fast undertaking with the\r\n Lodging-house Syndicate. They cannot let to other than members of the\r\n university without permission.\r\n\r\n [350] The tutor probably made his first appearance at King’s Hall;\r\n his office was firmly established by the middle of the xvi c. (later\r\n Statutes of Clare College, 1551), and marks the epoch when students\r\n other than those on the foundation were also firmly established as\r\n college inmates. Before the xviii c., however, the official tutor of\r\n to-day was not known; any fellow whom the master designated filled the\r\n post. In some colleges the tutor is appointed for life; at Trinity for\r\n a term of 10 years.\r\n\r\n [351] Like all other items of headgear the derivatives of the hood\r\n acquired ceremonial significance. The removable hood of the xiv c.,\r\n which was slung over the shoulder or attached to the arm, became the\r\n _capuce_ of the dignified clergy, of the doctors in the 3 faculties,\r\n rectors of colleges, and others in authority. It is preserved to-day\r\n in the _pellegrino_ of the Roman Church. The hood itself appears to\r\n have gained this ceremonial importance in the xv c.; and it is in the\r\n middle of that century that the hood as head-gear disappears, and is\r\n replaced by the various caps and bonnets which were formed from it.\r\n\r\n [352] The amess was a capuce of fur.\r\n\r\n [353] Statutes of Peterhouse 1338-1342. The same is prescribed for the\r\n junior students of King’s Hall (temp. Richard II.). Precisely the same\r\n regulations--for the tonsure and _vestis talaris_--were made for the\r\n scholar at the university of Paris.\r\n\r\n [354] This accorded with the custom at Bologna and at Salamanca\r\n (xiv c.)--_una capa scolastica_ ... _foderata sufficienter pellibus\r\n pecudis_. At Salamanca each scholar received annually one cappa lined\r\n with sheepskin, and one unlined, and a lined hood.\r\n\r\n [355] The object of most of the rules regarding scholars’ dress seems\r\n to have been to enforce sumptuary restrictions, and impose something\r\n clerical and sober in appearance--_decenter et honeste_ are the words\r\n used in the statutes of King’s Hall. The same is true of similar\r\n regulations in Italian universities.\r\n\r\n [356] The cappa (with a hood?) probably constituted the _speciem\r\n scholasticam_ which pseudo-scholars in the town were forbidden to\r\n imitate. (_Statuta Antiqua_, statute 42.)\r\n\r\n [357] An order of the time of Henry V. (documents Nos. 90, 91 in the\r\n Registry) requires the Cambridge bachelors to dress like those at\r\n Oxford; which probably referred to the black _capuce_ or hood of the\r\n Oxford bachelor?\r\n\r\n [358] This feat was celebrated by verses inscribed: _Mutantque\r\n Quadrata Rotundit_. A square cap (called both ‘scholastic’ and\r\n ‘ecclesiastical’) was recognised as the proper head-gear for Cambridge\r\n fellows graduates and foundation-scholars in the later xvi. c.\r\n Pensioners were to wear a round cap.\r\n\r\n [359] For the coloured gown see _infra_.\r\n\r\n [360] The _pileum_ placed on the head of the new master of arts in\r\n the xv? and xvi centuries, probably symbolised the termination of\r\n the _status pupillaris_. Cf. _Haec mera libertas, hoc nobis pilea\r\n donant_; and _servos ad pileum vocare_ (Livy). The tall silk hat\r\n signified the same thing. It was worn by young _M.A.’s_, and by the\r\n ‘Hat-fellow-commoners,’ and is still worn by _M.A.’s_ on a visit to\r\n their _alma mater_ though not by resident ‘dons.’\r\n\r\n [361] This was not worn at Trinity, King’s, and one or two other\r\n colleges.\r\n\r\n [362] It is interesting to note that the Scotch universities retain\r\n the violet gown. The Scots’ College in Rome (founded in 1600) dresses\r\n its collegians in a violet cassock, over which is a black _soprana_.\r\n\r\n [363] Bachelors of arts whether they be scholars reading for a\r\n fellowship or young graduates preparing for the ‘Second Part’ of\r\n a tripos, are still _in statu pupillari_. Perhaps, then, the more\r\n important gown, the bachelor’s, retained this vestige of the older\r\n dress which has been lost in the modification undergone by the\r\n undergraduates’. That the strings indicate a state of dependence\r\n is confirmed by their being found on the dress of the pope’s lay\r\n chamberlains called _camerieri di cappa e spada_; the papal palfrey\r\n men and other domestics being also provided with them.\r\n\r\n [364] A custom now dying out.\r\n\r\n [365] Christopher Wordsworth became Master of his college.\r\n\r\n [366] Studies were much later additions in the colleges, and at first\r\n a room would be fitted with 8 or 10 ‘studies,’ alcoves or cabinets\r\n 5 ft. 6 in. by 6 ft., which would be eagerly hired by students.\r\n Sometimes the studies were furnished by the pensioners with the\r\n necessary desk and shelves. No attempt at decoration of college rooms\r\n appears to have been made till the poet Gray placed scented flowers\r\n in his window and bought Japanese vases of the blue and white china\r\n afterwards to become so fashionable--which caused much remark. When\r\n young peers came up to Cambridge attended by their tutor and an\r\n ample _suite_ the colleges were much put about to lodge them, and we\r\n find Lady Rutland as early as 1590 sending hangings for her son’s\r\n with-drawing-room at Corpus.\r\n\r\n [367] The enmity of ‘town and gown,’ a consequence, no doubt, of\r\n the thronging of our university towns with an alien population, is\r\n traditional, and we first hear of it in 1249 before any colleges were\r\n built. Fifty years later (in 1305) the townsmen attacked the gownsmen,\r\n wounding and beating both masters and scholars “to the manifest\r\n delaying of their study” says the King’s letter on the subject\r\n (33rd of Edw. I.). Bad relations between ‘town and gown’ prevailed\r\n throughout the reign of Elizabeth. Cf. v. p. 261.\r\n\r\n [368] The allowance per head per week for food or “commons” was at\r\n Michaelhouse 12d. in 1324, and no more was allowed in the xvi c. at\r\n Christ’s and S. John’s. The allowance at Jesus College was 4d. a week\r\n in excess of this, and this was the sum which Archbishop Arundel\r\n had sanctioned for fellows’ commons earlier in the century (1405).\r\n Peterhouse statutes made no provision, but the Bishop of Ely as\r\n visitor restricted commons to 14d. a week in 1516. Mullinger, _Hist.\r\n Univ. Camb._ p. 461.\r\n\r\n [369] Undergraduates have perhaps shown a tendency to get out of\r\n hand since the day a few years back when some of the dons invited\r\n an expression of their opinion, apparently expecting that a serious\r\n question affecting the university would receive illustration from a\r\n little hooliganism.\r\n\r\n [370] In June 1905 there were 647 tripos candidates, 146 for\r\n the Natural Sciences, 127 for History, 111 Classics, 95 Law, 63\r\n Mathematics, 28 Mechanical Science, 25 Theology, 13 Modern Languages,\r\n 5 Moral Sciences, 5 Economics, 1 Oriental Languages. The year before\r\n Natural Sciences was also at the top of the poll with 131 graduates;\r\n the Classical came next with 112, the Mathematical 67, History 63.\r\n Some 30% therefore take Natural or Mechanical Sciences, and some of\r\n the mathematical students stay on for scientific work. The far larger\r\n number of men now take the First Part of the Mathematical, Classical,\r\n or Natural Sciences tripos in their third year, which gives them the\r\n _B.A._, and do not proceed to the Second Part. For the proportion of\r\n First and Second classes obtained cf. vi. p. 356 _n._\r\n\r\n It was, however, only very gradually that the classical and other\r\n triposes worked their way to an equality in popularity with the\r\n mathematical. It was not till 1884, after the division of the tripos,\r\n that the classical men were slightly in excess of the mathematical\r\n (see chap. iii.).\r\n\r\n [371] On the other hand Oxford has had 9 wins in succession.\r\n\r\n [372] The wearing of the surplice in chapel on Sundays and holidays\r\n by all undergraduates, scholars, and bachelors, is a very interesting\r\n historical survival at Cambridge, which has successfully resisted\r\n the attacks of Puritanism. It is worn by all members of a college on\r\n ‘white nights’ (vigils and feasts), and is the ancient dress of the\r\n canon and of clerks of all grades at divine service.\r\n\r\n [373] “Scarlet days” are Easter, Christmas, Ascension, Whitsunday,\r\n Trinity Sunday, All Saints, the first Sunday in November (when\r\n benefactors are commemorated) and Commencement Tuesday (the next\r\n before June 24). The vice-chancellor may appoint other days.\r\n\r\n [374] Everett, _On the Cam_. Everett’s father was United States\r\n ambassador at the Court of S. James’, and he himself was a graduate of\r\n Trinity College.\r\n\r\n [375] Wolsey, son of a well-to-do Suffolk butcher, was sent to Oxford,\r\n but Thomas Cromwell, who was the son of a blacksmith, probably was not\r\n educated at a university.\r\n\r\n [376] _The New Sect of Latitude-men_, 1662.\r\n\r\n [377] Eton--Cambridge and Oxford--3 each; Oxford had 3 from\r\n Winchester, all the rest coming from the lesser public schools,\r\n Haileybury (3), and church schools such as Radley.\r\n\r\n [378] A very interesting symptom is the recent election of an American\r\n fellow at Trinity and Christ’s Colleges.\r\n\r\n [379] In the time of Caius the number of students was 1783 (see p. 217\r\n _n._). Trinity held 359 of these, John’s 271, Christ’s 157, King’s\r\n 140, Clare 129,\r\n\r\n [Sidenote: A.D. 1573.]\r\n\r\n Queens’ 122. Magdalene and S. Catherine’s were the smallest with 49\r\n and 32 respectively. The remaining 6 colleges held between 62 and 96\r\n students each, except Jesus which had a population of 118. A hundred\r\n\r\n [Sidenote: A.D. 1672.]\r\n\r\n years after Caius the numbers were 2522. 3000 is about the maximum at\r\n either university since the xiii c. At Cambridge the undergraduate\r\n population at the present date (October 1906) exceeds 3200, with over\r\n 350 resident bachelors, and about 650 _M.A.’s_ and doctors, 400 of\r\n whom are fellows.\r\n\r\n Cf. with the figures given on p. 206. A man may keep his name on the\r\n boards of his college by a payment varying from £2 to £4 a year. The\r\n number of men “on the boards” of the university includes all those on\r\n the boards of their colleges and has grown in 150 years from 1500 (in\r\n 1748) to 13,819 in 1906-7.\r\n\r\n [380] Those marked with an asterisk are included principally for their\r\n influence on education.\r\n\r\n [381] _Or_ Walter de Merton.\r\n\r\n [382] Raleigh was entered as a boy for Oriel College but never resided\r\n there.\r\n\r\n [383] Gladstone was by race a pure Scotsman, but was English by birth\r\n and breeding.\r\n\r\n [384] Miss Nightingale is taken as a representative of the work of\r\n Howard, Clarkson, Shaftesbury, Hannah More, Mrs. Fry, and others of\r\n the same noble army among whom she is perhaps typical for the English\r\n adventuresome and pioneer spirit.\r\n\r\n It would not be possible to choose 40 great Englishmen whom every\r\n one should agree to be among the 40 greatest, or the best types in\r\n the lines indicated.

Green.\r\n\r\n [390] The first number appeared in November 1665 and was called “The\r\n Oxford Gazette,” the court being at that time at Oxford on account of\r\n the plague which was then raging in town.\r\n\r\n [391] The succession of archbishops of Canterbury from 1486 is:\r\n Cardinal Morton, Oxford; Warham (1500), neither university; Cranmer,\r\n Cambridge; Pole, Oxford; Parker, Cambridge; Grindal, Cambridge;\r\n Whitgift, Cambridge; Bancroft (1604), Cambridge.\r\n\r\n Among the names given above, those with an asterisk were further\r\n connected with their university as founders, Masters and fellows of\r\n colleges, or as chancellors.\r\n\r\n [392] Sydenham took a medical degree at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n [393] Cf. the Duke of Exeter, ii. pp. 58 _n._, 156.\r\n\r\n [394] The plate of Queens’ College is preserved at Oxford to this day.\r\n\r\n [395] Chief of whom was the Earl of Manchester, like Cromwell himself\r\n a Cambridge man. Cromwell and Lord Grey of Wark had “dealt very\r\n earnestly” with the Heads of colleges to extract a loan of £6000 for\r\n the public use. The earnest dealing included shutting most of them up\r\n till midnight. Cromwell on their refusal declared he would have taken\r\n £1000; not that that sum would have been of any service, but because\r\n it would have shown that they had one of the universities on their\r\n side. All that Cambridge had, however, was sent to Charles.\r\n\r\n [396] Compton and Trelawney.\r\n\r\n [397] There had been a previous meeting at Lambeth Palace in which\r\n Turner, White, Tenison (then rector of S. Martin’s) and Compton, the\r\n suspended Bishop of London, took part. All were Cambridge men except\r\n Compton. At a consultation of London clergy Tillotson, then Dean of\r\n Canterbury, Sherlock, Master of the Temple, Stillingfleet, Archdeacon\r\n of London and Dean of S. Paul’s, and Patrick, Dean of Peterborough,\r\n supported Edward Fowler (an Oxonian) in a declaration that they were\r\n unable to publish the Indulgence. Every one of these men was from\r\n Cambridge.\r\n\r\n [398] He had not received his call in time to sign the protest of the\r\n seven bishops. Lloyd was at Cambridge, Frampton at Oxford.\r\n\r\n [399] See ii. p. 57, the dissolution of the friars of the Sack.\r\n\r\n [400] Scory, Bishop of Hereford, had been given preferment by Cranmer\r\n on the dissolution of the Dominicans; he was put into the see of the\r\n deprived Catholic bishop Day of Chichester, a King’s man, and was\r\n one of Parker’s consecrators. In 1554 he renounced his wife and did\r\n penance before Bonner. The other, Day of King’s, Bishop of Winchester\r\n and brother of the Catholic prelate, was an ardent reformer.\r\n\r\n [401] Heath of Clare College was successively Bishop of Rochester and\r\n Worcester, and Primate of York.\r\n\r\n [402] Cuthbert Tunstall, who had come to King’s Hall from Oxford, and\r\n afterwards studied at Padua, was himself one of the translators of the\r\n 1540 bible.\r\n\r\n [403] See ii. p. 84.

For religion in\r\n Cambridge at the present day, see iv. pp. 246-7.\r\n\r\n [412] Burnet, the historian of the movement, writes: “They loved the\r\n constitution of the church, and the liturgy, and could well live\r\n under them; but they did not think it unlawful to live under another\r\n form.... They continued to keep a good correspondence with those\r\n who differed from them in opinion, and allowed a great freedom both\r\n in philosophy and in divinity; from whence they were called men of\r\n latitude. And upon this, men of narrower thoughts and fiercer tempers\r\n fastened upon them the name of Latitudinarians.”\r\n\r\n [413] “Within the bosom of Protestantism they kindled for the first\r\n time the love of this nobler speculation.” (_Tulloch, vol. 2. p. 24._)\r\n\r\n [414] Cf. Tulloch, _Rational Theology in England in the xvii century_\r\n (1872) vol. 2. p. 13, to whose able and interesting account of the\r\n movement I am very much indebted. “They sought,” writes Tulloch, “to\r\n confirm the union of philosophy and religion on the indestructible\r\n basis of reason and the essential elements of our higher humanity”:\r\n and again: “It is the glory of the Cambridge divines that they\r\n welcomed this new spirit of speculation” and “gave it frank\r\n entertainment in their halls of learning.” “Their liberalism takes a\r\n higher flight” than that of Hales and Chillingworth.\r\n\r\n [415] His _True Intellectual System of the Universe_ was published in\r\n 1678.\r\n\r\n [416] Afterwards fellow of Queens’, Hebrew lecturer and Greek\r\n praelector.\r\n\r\n [417] Whichcote’s moral and philosophical style of preaching now\r\n replaced “that doctrinal style which Puritans have curiously always\r\n considered to be more identical with the simplicity of Scriptural\r\n truth.” Tulloch.\r\n\r\n [418] The Conqueror gave him the barony of Bourne in the fen.\r\n\r\n [419] The de Vere of Matilda’s time had been her faithful adherent;\r\n Cambridgeshire was one of the ten English counties in which the Veres\r\n held lands, and they were the benefactors of the Cambridge Dominicans.\r\n\r\n [420] See also i. pp. 19, 44, ii. p. 110 _n._ and p. 296.\r\n\r\n [421] Manfield was nephew to Castle-Bernard another Cambridge\r\n landowner.\r\n\r\n [422] Dugdale, _Monasticon_ p. 1600.

Bynghams and Bassetts and Percies, and the xiv c.\r\n names so often recorded, it should not be forgotten that few early\r\n figures in the university are more interesting than that of Chancellor\r\n Stephen Segrave mentioned on pp. 203 and 259. Segrave was Bishop of\r\n Armagh and titular bishop of Ostia. He had been a clerk in the royal\r\n household, and was the champion of the university against the friars.\r\n It will be remembered that Nicholas Segrave--a baron of de Montfort’s\r\n parliament in 1265--had been one of those defenders of Kenilworth who\r\n held out in the isle of Ely till July 1267.\r\n\r\n [436] Cf. pp. 203 _n._, 294 _n._\r\n\r\n [437] One of the Pastons married Anna Beaufort a great-granddaughter\r\n of John of Gaunt.\r\n\r\n [438] Gray took the _LL.B._ on returning to the university.\r\n\r\n [439] Morland improved the fire engine and invented the speaking\r\n trumpet--one of his trumpets is preserved in the library at Trinity.\r\n He was 10 years at Cambridge, and was assistant to Cromwell’s\r\n secretary, Thurloe.\r\n\r\n [440] Woodward went to Cambridge when he was 30 years old.\r\n\r\n [441] The original double monastery of Ely did not become Benedictine\r\n till 970. See i. p. 12. Etheldreda (‘S. Audrey’) was the daughter\r\n of Anna king of the East Angles, and of Hereswitha sister of Hild,\r\n and wife to Oswy king of Northumbria. She thus united in her person\r\n the destinies of the northern provinces and East Anglia (where she\r\n was born) a union which has been perpetuated in the university of\r\n Cambridge. She was born _circa_ 630, and died in 679. As “the Lady of\r\n Ely” her will, living or dead, was held to decide the fortunes of the\r\n city.\r\n\r\n [442] i. p. 16. Her name was given to the only monastic house in\r\n Cambridge. Rhadegund was abbess of Ste. Croix A.D.\r\n 519-587.\r\n\r\n [443] It is sufficiently remarkable that a conspicuous rôle pertained\r\n almost exclusively to Englishwomen who were of the blood royal. This\r\n is true in the case of the great abbesses, and from the time of Hild\r\n and Etheldreda to that of Lady Margaret.\r\n\r\n [444] For the circumstances in which Clare and Pembroke were founded,\r\n see chap. ii. pp. 67-8 and 69, 71-2.\r\n\r\n [445] The countesses of Clare, Pembroke, Richmond, and Sussex.\r\n\r\n [446] Erasmus’ “three colleges” which represented for him the\r\n university and its new learning were Queens’, Christ’s, and S. John’s,\r\n all founded by women.\r\n\r\n [447] Lady Mildred Cecil gave money to the Master of S. John’s “to\r\n procure to have fyres in the hall of that colledg uppon all sondays\r\n and hollydays betwixt the fest of all Sayntes and Candlemas, whan\r\n there war no ordinary fyres of the charge of the colledg.” And pp. 72,\r\n 86, 120, 155.\r\n\r\n [448] A pioneer committee had been formed in October 1862 to obtain\r\n the admission of women to university examinations; Miss Emily Davies\r\n was Hon. Secretary. The first step taken was to secure the examination\r\n of girls in the university Local Examinations which had been started\r\n in 1858, and a private examination for girls simultaneously with\r\n that for boys was held on the 14 Dec. 1863. These examinations were\r\n formally opened to girls in February 1865 (_infra_ p. 358). Meanwhile\r\n the Schools Enquiry commission of the previous year had brought into\r\n relief the absence of any education for girls after the school age.\r\n The commissioners were memorialised, and the immediate outcome was the\r\n scheme for a college, and the formation of a committee to carry it\r\n into effect. Cf. pp. 317-18 _n._\r\n\r\n [449] There were present Mrs. Manning, *Miss Emily Davies, *Sedley\r\n Taylor, and *H. R. Tomkinson. *Madame Bodichon, who was ill, was not\r\n present, but George Eliot wrote to her four days before the meeting, à\r\n propos of an appointment to see one of the members of the committee:\r\n “I am much occupied just now, but the better education of women is one\r\n of the objects about which I have _no doubt_, and I shall rejoice if\r\n this idea of a college can be carried out.”\r\n\r\n On the General Committee of Hitchin College the bishops of Peter\r\n borough and S. David’s, the Dean of Ely, Lady Hobart, Lord Lyttelton,\r\n Prof. F. D. Maurice, Sir James Paget, Rt. Hon. Russell Gurney, M.P.,\r\n Miss Anna Swanwick, and Miss Twining, sat with several others. On the\r\n Executive Committee were Mme. Bodichon, *Lady Goldsmid wife of Sir\r\n Francis Goldsmid elected liberal member for Reading in 1866, *Mrs.\r\n Russell Gurney, Prof. Seeley, Dean Stanley, and the members of the\r\n 1867 committee: while a Cambridge Committee included Professors Adams,\r\n Humphry, Lightfoot, Liveing, Drs. J. Venn, T. G. Bonney, the Revv. J.\r\n Porter, R. Burn, T. Markby, W. G. Clark; Henry Sidgwick, and Sedley\r\n Taylor. The asterisked names denote those who also constituted with 11\r\n others the first members of Girton College (p. 321).\r\n\r\n [450] Incorporated from 1872 as Girton College.\r\n\r\n [451] Two or three of the Cambridge colleges were built at a\r\n distance from the schools and the centre of the town: thus Alcock\r\n described Jesus College as “the college of the Blessed Virgin Mary,\r\n S. John Evangelist, and S. Rhadegund, _near Cambridge_.” Hitchin in\r\n Hertfordshire, the first site of Girton, was one of the homes of the\r\n English Gilbertines, a double order for men and women which was also\r\n established in Cambridge. i. p. 19 and _n._\r\n\r\n [452] This was followed by a bequest of £10,000.\r\n\r\n [453] It is interesting to find the names of Dillon and Davies\r\n continuing in the case of the first college for women at Cambridge the\r\n Irish and Welsh traditions of college founders. It is perhaps still\r\n more interesting to find that on her mother’s side Lady Stanley was\r\n descended from the companion-in-arms of de Burgh the “red earl” of\r\n Ulster, and that a Dillon intermarried with the heiress of the 2nd\r\n earl of Clare, names honoured as those of the woman founder of one of\r\n the first Cambridge colleges.\r\n\r\n [454] See the original committee _supra_ pp. 317-18 _n._ The existing\r\n members elect the majority of new members. The first official\r\n recognition of the existence of the college was made in 1880 when the\r\n Council of the Senate elected three members of the college from among\r\n its number, and so exercised a power conferred on it in the original\r\n articles of association.\r\n\r\n [455] The college still prepares for this examination; at Newnham it\r\n must be prepared for at the student’s own expense. It is however now\r\n usually taken by all students before coming up.\r\n\r\n [456] Classics: R. S. Cook (Mrs. C. P. Scott) and L. I. Lumsden.\r\n Mathematics: S. Woodhead (Mrs. Corbett) senior optime.\r\n\r\n [457] This was in 1882. First class honours in this tripos did not\r\n become usual until women came up better prepared from schools. A\r\n Cambridge man, however, writing in 1873 declares that a man may be a\r\n wrangler when his mathematical knowledge was contemporary with his\r\n admission to the university, but that “no one was ever placed in\r\n _any_ class of the (classical) tripos who came up to the university\r\n knowing only the elements of Greek grammar.... The classical man, if\r\n plucked,” (_i.e._ in mathematics) “loses 10 years’ labour”--the time\r\n spent in classics from early school days. Women, nevertheless, belied\r\n this dictum from the first; many have not known even “the elements of\r\n Greek grammar” when they came up, and few indeed have 10 years’ Greek\r\n studies on their shoulders when they take the tripos.\r\n\r\n [458] The Claude Montefiore prize was founded in memory of the\r\n donor’s wife, who was at Girton. The Agnata Butler prize is awarded\r\n to classical students by the Master of Trinity and his wife. One of\r\n the early scholarships, offered by Mr. Justice Wright, was described\r\n as “a year’s proceeds of an Oxford fellowship.” Dr. W. Cunningham,\r\n fellow of Trinity College, assigned, in 1898, the entire profits of\r\n his book _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_ towards a fund for\r\n publishing dissertations of conspicuous merit written by certificated\r\n Girton students. The above-named city companies have always been\r\n generous donors to the women’s colleges.\r\n\r\n [459] The committee of 1862 had had (as we see) for its avowed object\r\n the “obtaining the admission of women to university examinations”:\r\n the subsequent committee (of December 1867) was formed “for the\r\n establishment of a college holding to girls’ schools and home teaching\r\n a position analogous to that occupied by the universities towards the\r\n public schools for boys.” The following was the reply given by the\r\n first named committee when approached in March 1868 with a view to a\r\n joint memorial asking for “advanced examinations for women”:--“That\r\n this committee, believing that the distinctive advantage of the\r\n Cambridge University Local Examinations consists in their offering\r\n a common standard to boys and girls, and that the institution of\r\n independent schemes of examination for women exclusively tends to keep\r\n down the level of female education, cannot take part in the proposed\r\n memorial to the university of Cambridge for advanced examinations for\r\n women above the age of eighteen.”\r\n\r\n [460] “The brethren of Mount Carmel had a site at Newnham where\r\n they dwelt and where they founded their church, which site they had\r\n of Michael Malherbe” (Hundred Rolls ii. 360). “Here they made many\r\n cells, a church, a cloister, and dormitory, and the necessary offices,\r\n sufficiently well constructed, and here they dwelt for 40 years”\r\n (Barnwell Chartulary). See i. p. 20.\r\n\r\n [461] Scroope Terrace occupies part of the ground of Newnham Manor.\r\n Like the other great benefactors of colleges, Lady Elizabeth Clare and\r\n Lady Margaret Beaufort, Lady Anne was three times married. Her mother\r\n was a Gonville. Corpus Christi College benefited by tithes and houses\r\n in the manors both of Girton and Newnham (p. 318).\r\n\r\n [462] Those who held that Grantchester and Cambridge were but one\r\n and the same town, told us that the principal part lay on the north,\r\n towards Girton, while Newnham Lane, beyond the mill, extended as far\r\n as Grantchester “the old Cambridge”: _Ad Neunhamiae vicum, ultra\r\n molendinam, que se longius promovebat versus Grantacestriam_....\r\n (Caius).\r\n\r\n [463] It may be recorded here that Madame Bodichon’s scheme was for\r\n a college (_a_) _in_ Cambridge (_b_) with the same intellectual\r\n conditions and tests as applied to men and (_c_) free of\r\n denominationalism. A chapel was not erected at Girton till after\r\n 1895. Of Mme. Bodichon as a pioneer it has been said that she had\r\n the singular faculty for realising in her imagination exactly what\r\n she wanted, down to the last detail--the creative power. Her failing\r\n health for the last fourteen years of her life made impossible the\r\n active share in the work which had been so ungrudgingly undertaken by\r\n her between 1867 and 1877; but her interest extended to every student\r\n who went up to Girton, and she was at pains to know them and to find\r\n out from their conversation how the college might be improved.\r\n\r\n [464] This house, 74 Regent Street, had been hired by (Professor)\r\n Henry Sidgwick in the spring of the year at his own financial risk,\r\n and here Miss Clough came in September.\r\n\r\n [465] The names of the 16 men (one being a Frenchman) who first\r\n lectured to women at the university are treasured at Newnham. Six were\r\n S. John’s men, 4 Trinity, and the other colleges represented were\r\n Christ’s, Queens’, and Caius. They were:\r\n\r\n  †F. D. Maurice.\r\n  †W. W. Skeat.\r\n  †J. E. B. Mayor.\r\n   J. Peile.\r\n   W. C. Green.\r\n   M. Boquel.\r\n  †Prof. Cayley.\r\n   J. F. Moulton.\r\n  †W. K. Clifford.\r\n   J. Venn.\r\n  †A. Marshall.\r\n   Prof. C. C. Babington.\r\n   T. G. Bonney.\r\n   P. T. Main.\r\n   G. M. Garrett, Mus.D.\r\n   S. Taylor.\r\n\r\n Dr. (afterwards Sir) Michael Foster, Adam Sedgwick, Frank Balfour (all\r\n of the Physiological laboratory) H. Sidgwick, Mr. Archer-Hind, Dr. E.\r\n S. Shuckburgh, and Mr. Keynes were also among the earliest lecturers.\r\n\r\n The general committee then formed included the first 3 of these names,\r\n and Nos. 7, 8, and 10; with Prof. Adams, Mr. Henry Jackson, and Mr.\r\n (afterwards Sir) R. C. Jebb. The Executive were: Prof. Maurice, Mr. T.\r\n G. Bonney, Mr. Ferrers (afterwards Master of Gonville and Caius) Mr.\r\n Peile (now Master of Christ’s) Mrs. Adams (the wife of the Lowndean\r\n professor) Mrs. Fawcett (the wife of the professor of Political\r\n Economy) Miss M. G. Kennedy, and Mrs. Venn (the wife of Dr. Venn of\r\n Caius) H. Sidgwick and T. Markby, Hon. secretaries, and Mrs. Bateson\r\n (the wife of the Master of S. John’s) Hon. treasurer.\r\n\r\n Certain courses of lectures in the public and inter-collegiate lecture\r\n rooms were open to women from 1873--22 out of the 34. A few years\r\n later 29 were open, and now all are open.\r\n\r\n [466] _Memoir_ of her aunt, by Blanche Athena Clough, Arnold, 1897--to\r\n which I am indebted for many of these details.\r\n\r\n [467] In her diary written the year she came of age she writes that\r\n honour and praise were not what she cared for. “If I were a man I\r\n would not work for riches or to leave a wealthy family behind me; I\r\n would work for my country, and make its people my heirs.”\r\n\r\n [468] This she lived to see accomplished. A training college for\r\n women was proposed by Miss Buss in 1885 and Miss E. P. Hughes was its\r\n first principal and guiding spirit at Cambridge. Out of this grew the\r\n latter’s Association of Assistant Mistresses.\r\n\r\n [469] The Association formed to promote the interests of students\r\n working for the university Higher Local examinations; see p. 326. The\r\n Newnham Hall Company was constituted in 1874 to build the first Hall.\r\n\r\n [470] The cost of which was mainly defrayed by a bequest for the\r\n benefit of women left by Mrs. Pfeiffer and her husband.\r\n\r\n [471] Mrs. Sidgwick is the daughter of the late James Balfour and of\r\n Lady Blanche Cecil, who was the sister of one Prime Minister as Mrs.\r\n Sidgwick is of another. Miss M. G. Kennedy is the daughter of the late\r\n Benjamin Hall Kennedy, one of the revisers of the New Testament with\r\n Lightfoot, Westcott, and Hort; fellow of S. John’s, Canon of Ely, and\r\n Regius Professor of Greek, in whose honour the Latin professorship was\r\n founded.\r\n\r\n [472] The style of Principal was, as we have already seen, used for\r\n the chief of a hostel in the university; it was also the tide of the\r\n head of the _domus universitatis_, University Hall (1326).\r\n\r\n [473] See page 355. 1874 was the year in which Prof. James Ward was\r\n alone among the men in the first class when two of the examiners\r\n thought Mary Paley (Mrs. Marshall) should be there also, and two\r\n placed her in the second: no one doubts that Miss Paley attained the\r\n first class standard of any other year.\r\n\r\n [474] Professor of Anatomy.\r\n\r\n [475] Afterwards Mrs. Koppel.\r\n\r\n [476] October 1906. There are at Newnham 6 scholarships worth £50 a\r\n year, 1 of £70, 1 of £40, and 2 of £35. There is also a studentship of\r\n £75 and another of £80 a year, tenable for one year or more. Of these,\r\n two are for natural science students, one for a classic.\r\n\r\n Through the munificence of private donors Newnham has been enabled to\r\n appoint 4 fellows of the college, and a fund is being formed which it\r\n is hoped will place these fellowships on a permanent basis.\r\n\r\n [477] These include many who read for a tripos, and a large number who\r\n in early days passed in the various Higher Local “Groups,” besides all\r\n who have taken special courses of study.\r\n\r\n [478] Professor Seeley’s rendering of her views for use at the public\r\n meeting at Birmingham. In a leaflet appealing for funds, Miss Clough\r\n said that the Cambridge lectures had been “a free-will offering”\r\n made to women by members of the university; here at Cambridge women\r\n of “different occupations, different stations in life, and different\r\n religious persuasion” were brought together to receive in common “at\r\n least some share of academic education.” “If we are right,” she says,\r\n “in thinking our object one of national importance” the expense should\r\n not be thrown on Cambridge residents, “much less should members of the\r\n university, who are already giving their time ungrudgingly, be called\r\n upon to give money also.” The journey to Birmingham was made with Miss\r\n M. G. Kennedy, and Mrs. Fawcett addressed the meeting.\r\n\r\n [479] It is interesting to note that there have been several students\r\n at both colleges bearing old Cambridge names, some known there in the\r\n xii, xiii, xiv and xv centuries: Bassett, Mortimer, Frost, Gaunt,\r\n Bingham, Booth, Parker, Alcock, Skelton, Crook, Bullock, Bentley,\r\n Parr, Creighton, Cartwright, Ridley, Day, May, Wallis, Sanderson,\r\n Morland, Herschell, Jebb, Sedgwick, Paley, and several others.\r\n\r\n [480] Some forty members of Parliament voted in favour of the “Graces”\r\n on this occasion.\r\n\r\n [481] See p. 338 _n._\r\n\r\n [482] Another clergyman also--the Rev. E. W. Bowling, afterwards\r\n rector of Houghton Conquest, and a light blue champion in the boat\r\n race.\r\n\r\n _Battle of the Pons Trium Trojanorum_, Thursday Feb. 24. 1881.\r\n\r\n    Aemilia Girtonensis\r\n    By the Nine Muses swore\r\n    That the great house of Girton\r\n    Should suffer wrong no more.\r\n    By the Mutes Nine she swore it\r\n    And named a voting day\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    But by the yellow Camus\r\n    Was tumult and affright\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    ‘O Varius, Father Varius,\r\n    To whom the Trojans pray,\r\n    The ladies are upon us!\r\n    We look to thee this day!’\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The Three stood calm and silent\r\n    And frowned upon their foes,\r\n    As a great shout of laughter\r\n    From the four hundred rose.\r\n\r\n\r\n [483] The first man to maintain that girls had a right to as good\r\n an education as boys, was a _Cantab_ (Eton and King’s College) a\r\n master at the new Merchant-Taylors’ school, and afterwards headmaster\r\n of Colet’s school. Lancelot Andrewes was one of his pupils. This\r\n famous Cantab and famous schoolmaster--Richard Mulcaster--also\r\n advised that teachers should be trained to teach. In the xviii c.\r\n Defoe’s appreciation of the woman with ‘knowledge’--“well-bred and\r\n well-taught”--led to his suggestion that there should be a college for\r\n her higher education.\r\n\r\n [484] For the subjects of this tripos, see iii. pp. 187-189.\r\n\r\n [485] _For the 20 years from 1886 to 1906_:--\r\n\r\n  Mathematics 345 candidates,\r\n      31 wranglers                     First and 2nd classes 56 per cent.\r\n\r\n  Classics 296 candidates,\r\n      54 first classes                   “        “          61    “\r\n\r\n  Moral Sciences 83 candidates, 21\r\n      first classes (this excludes\r\n      the triumphs of the first\r\n      12 years)                          “        “          76    “\r\n\r\n  Natural Sciences 246 candidates,\r\n      64 first classes                   “        “          70    “\r\n\r\n  History 290 candidates,\r\n      49 first classes                   “        “          64    “\r\n\r\n  Medieval and Modern Languages\r\n      (tripos created in 1886) 246\r\n      candidates, 73 first classes       “       “           74    “\r\n\r\n Hence in these 6 triposes the highest percentage of Firsts has been\r\n obtained in the Moral Sciences, Languages, and Natural Sciences,\r\n Classics coming fourth; while in the percentage of First and Second\r\n classes the order is again: Moral Sciences, Languages, Natural\r\n Sciences, followed by History, Classics, and Mathematics.\r\n\r\n In the first 10 years 250 students took a tripos, of whom one in five\r\n (51) was placed in the first class.\r\n\r\n Among the men the percentage of _First Classes_ for _the years\r\n 1900-1905_ is: mathematics 39 per cent, classics 28 per cent. For the\r\n subjects chosen by men cf. iv. p. 238 _n._\r\n\r\n [486] There are, roughly, 3000 men and 300 women at the university.\r\n Since 1881, 94 women and 168 men have taken this tripos--the\r\n proportion should have been 940 men.\r\n\r\n [487] The founders of Girton have been steadfast in demanding the\r\n degree. In 1887, 842 members of the senate signed a petition in\r\n favour of it. Miss Clough had signed a similar petition earlier. The\r\n objections to opening the degrees to women have been adequately met\r\n in the pamphlet “Women in the Universities of England and Scotland,”\r\n Cambridge, Macmillan and Bowes, 1896.\r\n\r\n [488] The entries for 1863, when girls were first informally examined,\r\n were 639, the next year they rose to 844.\r\n\r\n [489] Statutes regulating the examination of women, and opening to\r\n them the Mathematical, Natural Sciences, and Modern History schools,\r\n were voted in 1886 by a majority of 464 votes to 321. Responsions and\r\n the other schools were opened to women in 1888, 1890, and 1893 (the\r\n Theological school, Oriental studies, and the _D.Mus._) and in 1894\r\n the remaining examinations were opened. Pass and honour examinations\r\n are both open to women at Oxford, and the names of successful\r\n candidates appear in the official lists. The certificate, however,\r\n is given by the Oxford Association for the Education of Women, who\r\n restrict it to those students who have qualified like the men on all\r\n points.\r\n\r\n [Sidenote: The position of women in other universities.]\r\n\r\n In 1856 the first application was made--by Jessie White to London\r\n university--for admission as a candidate for the medical degree. A\r\n similar request was made seven years later. A supplementary charter\r\n establishing special examinations for women was procured by this\r\n university in 1869. In 1878 it made “every degree, honour, and prize\r\n awarded by the university accessible to students of both sexes on\r\n perfectly equal terms.” Since 1889 all disqualification for women\r\n in Scotch universities has ceased. The Victoria university, by its\r\n original charter 20 April 1880, admitted both sexes equally to\r\n its degrees and distinctions; and in 1895 Durham became a “mixed”\r\n university. All the more recent universities treat men and women\r\n equally.",
