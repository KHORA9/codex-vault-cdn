Heraldry has been termed \"the shorthand of History,\" but\r\nnevertheless the study of that shorthand has been approached too often as\r\nif it were but the study of a dead language. The result has been that too\r\nmuch faith has been placed in the works of older writers, whose dicta have\r\nbeen accepted as both unquestionably correct at the date they wrote, and,\r\nas a consequence, equally binding at the present day.\r\n\r\nSince the \"Boke of St. Albans\" was written, into the heraldic portion of\r\nwhich the author managed to compress an unconscionable amount of rubbish,\r\nbooks and treatises on the subject of Armory have issued from the press in\r\na constant succession. A few of them stand a head and shoulders above the\r\nremainder. The said remainder have already sunk into oblivion. Such a book\r\nas \"Guillim\" must of necessity rank in the forefront of any armorial\r\nbibliography; but any one seeking to judge the Armory of the present day by\r\nthe standards and ethics adopted by that writer, would find himself making\r\nmistake after mistake, and led hopelessly astray. There can be very little\r\ndoubt that the \"Display of Heraldry\" is an accurate representation of the\r\nlaws of Armory which governed the use of Arms at the date the book was\r\nwritten; and it correctly puts forward the opinions which were then\r\naccepted concerning the past history of the science.\r\n\r\nThere are two points, however, which must be borne in mind.\r\n\r\nThe first is that the critical desire for accuracy which fortunately seems\r\nto have been the keynote of research during the nineteenth century, has\r\nproduced students of Armory whose investigations into facts have swept away\r\nthe fables, the myths, and the falsehood which had collected around the\r\nancient science, and which in their preposterous assertions had earned for\r\nArmory a ridicule, a contempt, and a disbelief which the science itself,\r\nand moreover the active practice of the science, had never at any time\r\nwarranted or deserved. The desire to gratify the vanity of illustrious\r\npatrons rendered the mythical traditions attached to Armory more difficult\r\nto explode than in the cases of those other sciences in which no one has a\r\npersonal interest in {x} upholding the wrong; but a study of the scientific\r\nworks of bygone days, and the comparison, for example, of a sixteenth or\r\nseventeenth century medical book with a similar work of the present day,\r\nwill show that all scientific knowledge during past centuries was a curious\r\nconglomeration of unquestionable fact, interwoven with and partly obscured\r\nby a vast amount of false information, which now can either be dismissed as\r\nutter rubbish or controverted and disproved on the score of being plausible\r\nuntruth. Consequently, Armory, no less than medicine, theology, or\r\njurisprudence, should not be lightly esteemed because our predecessors knew\r\nless about the subject than is known at the present day, or because they\r\nbelieved implicitly dogma and tradition which we ourselves know to be and\r\naccept as exploded. Research and investigation constantly goes on, and\r\nevery day adds to our knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe second point, which perhaps is the most important, is the patent fact\r\nthat Heraldry and Armory are not a dead science, but are an actual living\r\nreality. Armory may be a quaint survival of a time with different manners\r\nand customs, and different ideas from our own, but the word \"Finis\" has not\r\nyet been written to the science, which is still slowly developing and\r\naltering and changing as it is suited to the altered manners and customs of\r\nthe present day. I doubt not that this view will be a startling one to many\r\nwho look upon Armory as indissolubly associated with parchments and\r\nwritings already musty with age. But so long as the Sovereign has the power\r\nto create a new order of Knighthood, and attach thereto Heraldic insignia,\r\nso long as the Crown has the power to create a new coronet, or to order a\r\nnew ceremonial, so long as new coats of arms are being called into\r\nbeing,--for so long is it idle to treat Armory and Heraldry as a science\r\nincapable of further development, or as a science which in recent periods\r\nhas not altered in its laws.\r\n\r\nThe many mistaken ideas upon Armory, however, are not all due to the two\r\nconsiderations which have been put forward. Many are due to the fact that\r\nthe hand-books of Armory professing to detail the laws of the science have\r\nnot always been written by those having complete knowledge of their\r\nsubject. Some statement appears in a textbook of Armory, it is copied into\r\nbook after book, and accepted by those who study Armory as being correct;\r\nwhilst all the time it is absolutely wrong, and has never been accepted or\r\nacted upon by the Officers of Arms. One instance will illustrate my\r\nmeaning. There is scarcely a text-book of Armory which does not lay down\r\nthe rule, that when a crest issues from a coronet it must not be placed\r\nupon a wreath. Now there is no rule whatever upon the subject; and\r\ninstances are frequent, both in ancient and in modern grants, in which\r\ncoronets have been granted to be borne upon wreaths; and the wreath should\r\n{xi} be inserted or omitted _according to the original grant of the crest_.\r\nConsequently, the so-called rule must be expunged.\r\n\r\nAnother fruitful source of error is the effort which has frequently been\r\nmade to assimilate the laws of Armory prevailing in the three different\r\nkingdoms into one single series of rules and regulations. Some writers have\r\neven gone so far as to attempt to assimilate with our own the rules and\r\nregulations which hold upon the Continent. As a matter of fact, many of the\r\nlaws of Arms in England and Scotland are radically different; and care\r\nneeds to be taken to point out these differences.\r\n\r\nThe truest way to ascertain the laws of Armory is by deduction from known\r\nfacts. Nevertheless, such a practice may lead one astray, for the number of\r\nexceptions to any given rule in Armory is always great, and it is sometimes\r\ndifficult to tell what is the rule, and which are the exceptions. Moreover,\r\nthe Sovereign, as the fountain of honour, can over-ride any rule or law of\r\nArms; and many exceptional cases which have been governed by specific\r\ngrants have been accepted in times past as demonstrating the laws of\r\nArmory, when they have been no more than instances of exceptional favour on\r\nthe part of the Crown.\r\n\r\nIn England no one is compelled to bear Arms unless he wishes; but, should\r\nhe desire to do so, the Inland Revenue requires a payment of one or two\r\nguineas, according to the method of use. From this voluntary taxation the\r\nyearly revenue exceeds £70,000. This affords pretty clear evidence that\r\nArmory is still decidedly popular, and that its use and display are\r\nextensive; but at the same time it would be foolish to suppose that the\r\nestimation in which Armory is held, is equal to, or approaches, the\r\nromantic value which in former days was attached to the inheritance of\r\nArms. The result of this has been--and it is not to be wondered at--that\r\nancient examples are accepted and extolled beyond what should be the case.\r\nIt should be borne in mind that the very ancient examples of Armory which\r\nhave come down to us, may be examples of the handicraft of ignorant\r\nindividuals; and it is not safe to accept unquestioningly laws of Arms\r\nwhich are deduced from Heraldic _handicraft_ of other days. Most of them\r\nare correct, because as a rule such handicraft was done under supervision;\r\nbut there is always the risk that it has not been; and _this risk should be\r\nborne in mind_ when estimating the value of any particular example of\r\nArmory as proof or contradiction of any particular Armorial law. There were\r\n\"heraldic stationers\" before the present day.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar consideration must govern the estimate of the Heraldic\r\nart of a former day. To every action we are told there is a reaction; and\r\nthe reaction of the present day, admirable and commendable as it\r\nundoubtedly is, which has taken the art of Armory back to the style in\r\nvogue in past centuries, needs to be kept within intelligent {xii} bounds.\r\nThat the freedom of design and draughtsmanship of the old artists should be\r\ncopied is desirable; but at the same time there is not the slightest\r\nnecessity to copy, and to deliberately copy, the crudeness of execution\r\nwhich undoubtedly exists in much of the older work. The revulsion from what\r\nhas been aptly styled \"the die-sinker school of heraldry\" has caused some\r\nartists to produce Heraldic drawings which (though doubtless modelled upon\r\nancient examples) are grotesque to the last degree, and can be described in\r\nno other way.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have to repeat my grateful acknowledgments to the many\r\nindividuals who assisted me in the preparation of my \"Art of Heraldry,\"\r\nupon which this present volume is founded, and whose work I have again made\r\nuse of.\r\n\r\nThe very copious index herein is entirely the work of my professional\r\nclerk, Mr. H. A. Kenward, for which I offer him my thanks. Only those who\r\nhave had actual experience know the tedious weariness of compiling such an\r\nindex.\r\n\r\nA. C.

C.\r\n\r\n{1}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMPLETE GUIDE TO HERALDRY\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF ARMORY\r\n\r\nArmory is that science of which the rules and the laws govern the use,\r\ndisplay, meaning, and knowledge of the pictured signs and emblems\r\nappertaining to shield, helmet, or banner. Heraldry has a wider meaning,\r\nfor it comprises everything within the duties of a herald; and whilst\r\nArmory undoubtedly is Heraldry, the regulation of ceremonials and matters\r\nof pedigree, which are really also within the scope of Heraldry, most\r\ndecidedly are not Armory.\r\n\r\n\"Armory\" relates only to the emblems and devices. \"Armoury\" relates to the\r\nweapons themselves as weapons of warfare, or to the place used for the\r\nstoring of the weapons. But these distinctions of spelling are modern.\r\n\r\nThe word \"Arms,\" like many other words in the English language, has several\r\nmeanings, and at the present day is used in several senses. It may mean the\r\nweapons themselves; it may mean the limbs upon the human body. Even from\r\nthe heraldic point of view it may mean the entire achievement, but usually\r\nit is employed in reference to the device upon the shield only.\r\n\r\nOf the exact origin of arms and armory nothing whatever is definitely\r\nknown, and it becomes difficult to point to any particular period as the\r\nperiod covering the origin of armory, for the very simple reason that it is\r\nmuch more difficult to decide what is or is not to be admitted as armorial.\r\n{2}\r\n\r\nUntil comparatively recently heraldic books referred armory indifferently\r\nto the tribes of Israel, to the Greeks, to the Romans, to the Assyrians and\r\nthe Saxons; and we are equally familiar with the \"Lion of Judah\" and the\r\n\"Eagle of the Cæsars.\" In other directions we find the same sort of thing,\r\nfor it has ever been the practice of semi-civilised nations to bestow or to\r\nassume the virtues and the names of animals and of deities as symbols of\r\nhonour. We scarcely need refer to the totems of the North American Indians\r\nfor proof of such a practice. They have reduced the subject almost to an\r\nexact science; and there cannot be the shadow of a doubt that it is to this\r\nsemi-savage practice that armory is to be traced if its origin is to be\r\nfollowed out to its logical and most remote beginning. Equally is it\r\ncertain that many recognised heraldic figures, and more particularly those\r\nmythical creatures of which the armorial menagerie alone has now\r\ncognisance, are due to the art of civilisations older than our own, and the\r\nlegends of those civilisations which have called these mythical creatures\r\ninto being.\r\n\r\nThe widest definition of armory would have it that any pictorial badge\r\nwhich is used by an individual or a family with the meaning that it is a\r\nbadge indicative of that person or family, and adopted and repeatedly used\r\nin that sense, is heraldic. If such be your definition, you may ransack the\r\nScriptures for the arms of the tribes of Israel, the writings of the Greek\r\nand Roman poets for the decorations of the armour and the persons of their\r\nheroes, mythical and actual, and you may annex numberless \"heraldic\"\r\ninstances from the art of Nineveh, of Babylon, and of Egypt. Your heraldry\r\nis of the beginning and from the beginning. It _is_ fact, but is it\r\nheraldry? The statement in the \"Boke of St. Albans\" that Christ was a\r\ngentleman of coat armour is a fable, and due distinction must be had\r\nbetween the fact and the fiction in this as in all other similar cases.\r\n\r\nMr. G. W. Eve, in his \"Decorative Heraldry,\" alludes to and illustrates\r\nmany striking examples of figures of an embryonic type of heraldry, of\r\nwhich the best are one from a Chaldean bas-relief 4000 B. C., the earliest\r\nknown device that can in any way be called heraldic, and another, a device\r\nfrom a Byzantine silk of the tenth century. Mr. Eve certainly seems\r\ninclined to follow the older heraldic writers in giving as wide an\r\ninterpretation as possible to the word heraldic, but it is significant that\r\nnone of these early instances which he gives appear to have any relation to\r\na shield, so that, even if it be conceded that the figures are heraldic,\r\nthey certainly cannot be said to be armorial. But doubtless the inclusion\r\nof such instances is due to an attempt, conscious or unconscious, on the\r\npart of the writers who have taken their stand on the side of great\r\nantiquity to so frame the definition of armory that it shall include\r\neverything heraldic, and due perhaps somewhat to the half unconscious {3}\r\nreasoning that these mythical animals, and more especially the peculiarly\r\nheraldic positions they are depicted in, which nowadays we only know as\r\npart of armory, and which exist nowhere else within our knowledge save\r\nwithin the charmed circle of heraldry, must be evidence of the great\r\nantiquity of that science or art, call it which you will. But it is a false\r\ndeduction, due to a confusion of premise and conclusion. We find certain\r\nfigures at the present day purely heraldic--we find those figures fifty\r\ncenturies ago. It certainly seems a correct conclusion that, therefore,\r\nheraldry must be of that age. But is not the real conclusion, that, our\r\nheraldic figures being so old, it is evident that the figures originated\r\nlong before heraldry was ever thought of, and that instead of these\r\nmythical figures having been originated by the necessities of heraldry, and\r\nbeing part, or even the rudimentary origin of heraldry, they had existed\r\n_for other reasons and purposes_--and that when the science of heraldry\r\nsprang into being, it found the _whole range_ of its forms and charges\r\nalready existing, and that _none_ of these figures owe their being to\r\nheraldry? The gryphon is supposed to have _originated_, as is the\r\ndouble-headed eagle, from the dimidiation of two coats of arms resulting\r\nfrom impalement by reason of marriage. Both these figures were known ages\r\nearlier. Thus departs yet another of the little fictions which past writers\r\non armory have fostered and perpetuated. Whether the ancient Egyptians and\r\nAssyrians knew they were depicting mythical animals, and did it, intending\r\nthem to be symbolical of attributes of their deities, something beyond what\r\nthey were familiar with in their ordinary life, we do not know; nor indeed\r\nhave we any certain knowledge that there have never been animals of which\r\ntheir figures are but imperfect and crude representations.\r\n\r\nBut it does not necessarily follow that because an Egyptian artist drew a\r\ncertain figure, which figure is now appropriated to the peculiar use of\r\narmory, that he knew anything whatever of the laws of armory. Further,\r\nwhere is this argument to end? There is nothing peculiarly heraldic about\r\nthe lion passant, statant, dormant, couchant, or salient, and though\r\nheraldic artists may for the sake of artistic appearance distort the brute\r\naway from his natural figure, the rampant is alone the position which\r\nexists not in nature; and if the argument is to be applied to the bitter\r\nend, heraldry must be taken back to the very earliest instance which exists\r\nof any representation of a lion. The proposition is absurd. The ancient\r\nartists drew their lions how they liked, regardless of armory and its laws,\r\nwhich did not then exist; and, from decorative reasons, they evolved a\r\ncertain number of methods of depicting the positions of _e.g._ the lion and\r\nthe eagle to suit their decorative purposes. When heraldry came into\r\nexistence it came in as an adjunct of decoration, and it necessarily\r\nfollowed that the whole of the positions in which the {4} craftsmen found\r\nthe eagle or the lion depicted were appropriated with the animals for\r\nheraldry. That this appropriation for the exclusive purposes of armory has\r\nbeen silently acquiesced in by the decorative artists of later days is\r\nsimply proof of the intense power and authority which accrued later to\r\narmory, and which was in fact attached to anything relating to privilege\r\nand prerogative. To put it baldly, the dominating authority of heraldry and\r\nits dogmatic protection by the Powers that were, appropriated certain\r\nfigures to its use, and then defied any one to use them for more humble\r\ndecorative purposes not allied with armory. And it is the trail of this\r\nautocratic appropriation, and from the decorative point of view this\r\narrogant appropriation, which can be traced in the present idea that a\r\ngriffin or a spread eagle, for example, must be heraldic. Consequently the\r\nargument as to the antiquity of heraldry which is founded upon the\r\ndiscovery of the heraldic creature in the remote ages goes by the board.\r\nOne practical instance may perhaps more fully demonstrate my meaning. There\r\nis one figure, probably the most beautiful of all of those which we owe to\r\nEgypt, which is now rapidly being absorbed into heraldry. I refer to the\r\nSphinx. This, whilst strangely in keeping with the remaining mythical\r\nheraldic figures, for some reason or other escaped the exclusive\r\nappropriation of armorial use until within modern times. One of the\r\nearliest instances of its use in recognised armory occurs in the grant to\r\nSir John Moore, K.B., the hero of Corunna, and another will be found in the\r\naugmentation granted to Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, K.B. Since then it\r\nhas been used on some number of occasions. It certainly remained, however,\r\nfor the late Garter King of Arms to evolve from the depths of his\r\nimagination a position which no Egyptian sphinx ever occupied, when he\r\ngranted two of them as supporters to the late Sir Edward Malet, G.C.B. The\r\nSphinx has also been adopted as the badge of one of his Majesty's\r\nregiments, and I have very little doubt that now Egypt has come under our\r\ncontrol the Sphinx will figure in some number of the grants of the future\r\nto commemorate fortunes made in that country, or lifetimes spent in the\r\nEgyptian services. If this be so, the dominating influence of armory will\r\ndoubtless in the course of another century have given to the Sphinx, as it\r\nhas to many other objects, a distinctly heraldic nature and character in\r\nthe mind of the \"man in the street\" to which we nowadays so often refer the\r\narbitrament between conflicting opinions. Perhaps in the even yet more\r\nremote future, when the world in general accepts as a fact that armory did\r\nnot exist at the time of the Norman Conquest, we shall have some\r\ninteresting and enterprising individual writing a book to demonstrate that\r\nbecause the Sphinx existed in Egypt long before the days of Cleopatra,\r\nheraldry must of necessity be equally antique. {5}\r\n\r\nI have no wish, however, to dismiss thus lightly the subject of the\r\nantiquity of heraldry, because there is one side of the question which I\r\nhave not yet touched upon, and that is, the symbolism of these ancient and\r\nso-called heraldic examples. There is no doubt whatever that symbolism\r\nforms an integral part of armory; in fact there is no doubt that armory\r\n_itself_ as a whole is nothing more or less than a kind of symbolism. I\r\nhave no sympathy whatever with many of the ideas concerning this symbolism,\r\nwhich will be found in nearly all heraldic books before the day of the late\r\nJ. R. Planché, Somerset Herald, who fired the train which exploded then and\r\nfor ever the absurd ideas of former writers. That an argent field meant\r\npurity, that a field of gules meant royal or even martial ancestors, that a\r\nsaltire meant the capture of a city, or a lion rampant noble and enviable\r\nqualities, I utterly deny. But that nearly every coat of arms for any one\r\nof the name of Fletcher bears upon it in some form or another an arrow or\r\nan arrow-head, because the origin of the name comes from the occupation of\r\nthe fletcher, who was an arrow-maker, is true enough. Symbolism of that\r\nkind will be found constantly in armory, as in the case of the foxes and\r\nfoxes' heads in the various coats of Fox, the lions in the coats of arms of\r\nLyons, the horse in the arms of Trotter, and the acorns in the arms of\r\nOakes; in fact by far the larger proportion of the older coats of arms,\r\nwhere they can be traced to their real origin, exhibit some such\r\nderivation. There is another kind of symbolism which formerly, and still,\r\nfavours the introduction of swords and spears and bombshells into grants of\r\narms to military men, that gives bezants to bankers and those connected\r\nwith money, and that assigns woolpacks and cotton-plants to the shields of\r\ntextile merchants; but that is a sane and reasonable symbolism, which the\r\nreputed symbolism of the earlier heraldry books was not.\r\n\r\nIt has yet to be demonstrated, however, though the belief is very generally\r\ncredited, that all these very ancient Egyptian and Assyrian figures of a\r\nheraldic character had anything of symbolism about them. But even granting\r\nthe whole symbolism which is claimed for them, we get but little further.\r\nThere is no doubt that the eagle from untold ages has had an imperial\r\nsymbolism which it still possesses. But that symbolism is not necessarily\r\nheraldic, and it is much more probable that heraldry appropriated both the\r\neagle and its symbolism ready made, and together: consequently, if, as we\r\nhave shown, the _existence_ of the eagle is not proof of the coeval\r\nexistence of heraldry, no more is the existence of the _symbolical_\r\nimperial eagle. For if we are to regard all symbolism as heraldic, where\r\nare we either to begin or to end? Church vestments and ecclesiastical\r\nemblems are symbolism run riot; in fact they are little else: but by no\r\nstretch of imagination can these be {6} considered heraldic with the\r\nexception of the few (for example the crosier, the mitre, and the pallium)\r\nwhich heraldry has appropriated ready made. Therefore, though heraldry\r\nappropriated ready made from other decorative art, and from nature and\r\nhandicraft, the whole of its charges, and though it is evident heraldry\r\nalso appropriated ready made a great deal of its symbolism, neither the\r\nearlier existence of the forms which it appropriated, nor the earlier\r\nexistence of their symbolism, can be said to weigh at all as determining\r\nfactors in the consideration of the age of heraldry. Sloane Evans in his\r\n\"Grammar of Heraldry\" (p. ix.) gives the following instances as evidence of\r\nthe greater antiquity, and they are worthy at any rate of attention if the\r\nmatter is to be impartially considered.\r\n\r\n    \"The antiquity of ensigns and symbols may be proved by reference to\r\n    Holy Writ.\r\n\r\n    \"1. 'Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel,\r\n    after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of\r\n    their names.... And they assembled all the congregation together on the\r\n    first day of the second month; and they declared their pedigrees after\r\n    their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number\r\n    of the names, from twenty years old and upward.... And the children of\r\n    Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every\r\n    man by his own standard, throughout their hosts' (Numbers i. 2, 18,\r\n    52).\r\n\r\n    \"2.

The\r\nAthenians, for instance, bore an owl in their ensigns (Plutarchus\r\nLysandro), as being sacred to Minerva, the protectress of their city; the\r\nThebans a _Sphynx_ (_idem_ Pelopidas, Cornelius Nepos, Epaminondas), in\r\nmemory of the famous monster overcome by Oedipus. The Persians paid divine\r\nhonours to the sun, and therefore represented him in their ensigns\"\r\n(Curtius, lib. 3). Again (in page 150), speaking of the ornaments and\r\ndevices on their ships, he says: \"Some other things there are in the prow\r\nand stern that deserve our notice, as those ornaments wherewith the\r\nextremities of the ship were beautified, commonly called [Greek: akronea]\r\n(or [Greek: neôn korônides]), in Latin, _Corymbi_. The form of them\r\nsometimes represented helmets, sometimes living creatures, but most\r\nfrequently was winded into a round compass, whence they are so commonly\r\nnamed _Corymbi_ and _Coronæ_. To the [Greek: akrostolia] in the prow,\r\nanswered the [Greek: aphgasta] in the stern, which were often of an\r\norbicular figure, or fashioned like wings, to which a little shield called\r\n[Greek: aspideion], or [Greek: aspidiskê], was frequently affixed;\r\nsometimes a piece of wood was erected, whereon ribbons of divers colours\r\nwere hung, and served instead of a flag to distinguish the ship. [Greek:\r\nChêniskos] was so called from [Greek: Chên], _a Goose_, whose {10} figure\r\nit resembled, because geese were looked on as fortunate omens to mariners,\r\nfor that they swim on the top of the waters and sink not. [Greek:\r\nParasêmon] was the flag whereby ships were distinguished from one another;\r\nit was placed in the prow, just below the [Greek: stolos], being sometimes\r\ncarved, and frequently painted, whence it is in Latin termed _pictura_,\r\nrepresenting the form of a _mountain_, a _tree_, a _flower_, or any other\r\nthing, wherein it was distinguished from what was called _tutela_, or the\r\nsafeguard of the ship, which always represented _some one of the gods_, to\r\nwhose care and protection the ship was recommended; for which reason it was\r\nheld sacred. Now and then we find the _tutela_ taken for the [Greek:\r\nParasêmon], and perhaps sometimes the images of gods might be represented\r\non the flags; by some it is placed also in the prow, but by most authors of\r\ncredit assigned to the stern. Thus Ovid in his Epistle to Paris:--\r\n\r\n 'Accipit et pictos puppis adunca Deos.'\r\n\r\n 'The stern with painted deities richly shines.'\r\n\r\n\"The ship wherein Europa was conveyed from Phoenicia into Crete had a\r\n_bull_ for its flag, and _Jupiter_ for its tutelary deity. The Boeotian\r\nships had for their tutelar god _Cadmus_, represented with a _dragon_ in\r\nhis hand, because he was the founder of Thebes, the principal city of\r\nBoeotia. The name of the ship was usually taken from the flag, as appears\r\nin the following passage of Ovid, where he tells us his ship received its\r\nname from the helmet painted upon it:--\r\n\r\n 'Est mihi, sitque, precor, flavæ tutela Minervæ,\r\n  Navis et à pictâ casside nomen habit.'\r\n\r\n 'Minerva is the goddess I adore,\r\n  And may she grant the blessings I implore;\r\n  The ship its name a painted helmet gives.'\r\n\r\n\"Hence comes the frequent mention of ships called _Pegasi_, _Scyllæ_,\r\n_Bulls_, _Rams_, _Tigers_, &c., which the poets took liberty to represent\r\nas living creatures that transported their riders from one country to\r\nanother; nor was there (according to some) any other ground for those known\r\nfictions of Pegasus, the winged Bellerophon, or the Ram which is reported\r\nto have carried Phryxus to Colchos.\"\r\n\r\nTo quote another very learned author: \"The system of hieroglyphics, or\r\nsymbols, was adopted into every mysterious institution, for the purpose of\r\nconcealing the most sublime secrets of religion from the prying curiosity\r\nof the vulgar; to whom nothing was exposed but the beauties of their\r\nmorality.\" (See Ramsay's \"Travels of Cyrus,\" lib. 3.) \"The old Asiatic\r\nstyle, so highly figurative, seems, by what we find of {11} its remains in\r\nthe prophetic language of the sacred writers, to have been evidently\r\nfashioned to the mode of the ancient hieroglyphics; for as in hieroglyphic\r\nwriting the sun, moon, and stars were used to represent states and empires,\r\nkings, queens, and nobility--their eclipse and extinction, temporary\r\ndisasters, or entire overthrow--fire and flood, desolation by war and\r\nfamine; plants or animals, the qualities of particular persons, &c.; so, in\r\nlike manner, the Holy Prophets call kings and empires by the names of the\r\nheavenly luminaries; their misfortunes and overthrow are represented by\r\neclipses and extinction; stars falling from the firmament are employed to\r\ndenote the destruction of the nobility; thunder and tempestuous winds,\r\nhostile invasions; lions, bears, leopards, goats, or high trees, leaders of\r\narmies, conquerors, and founders of empires; royal dignity is described by\r\npurple, or a crown; iniquity by spotted garments; a warrior by a sword or\r\nbow; a powerful man, by a gigantic stature; a judge by balance, weights,\r\nand measures--in a word, the prophetic style seems to be a speaking\r\nhieroglyphic.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, however, that the whole of these are no more than\r\nsymbolism, though they are undoubtedly symbolism of a high and methodical\r\norder, little removed from our own armory. Personally I do not consider\r\nthem to be armory, but if the word is to be stretched to the utmost\r\nlatitude to permit of their inclusion, one certain conclusion follows. That\r\nif the heraldry of that day had an orderly existence, it most certainly\r\ncame absolutely to an end and disappeared. Armory as we know it, the armory\r\nof to-day, which as a system is traced back to the period of the Crusades,\r\nis no mere continuation by adoption. It is a distinct development and a\r\nre-development _ab initio_. Undoubtedly there is a period in the early\r\ndevelopment of European civilisation which is destitute alike of armory, or\r\nof anything of that nature. The civilisation of Europe is not the\r\ncivilisation of Egypt, of Greece, or of Rome, nor a continuation thereof,\r\nbut a new development, and though each of these in its turn attained a high\r\ndegree of civilisation and may have separately developed a heraldic\r\nsymbolism much akin to armory, as a natural consequence of its own\r\ndevelopment, as the armory we know is a development of its own consequent\r\nupon the rise of our own civilisation, nevertheless it is unjustifiable to\r\nattempt to establish continuity between the ordered symbolism of earlier\r\nbut distinct civilisations, and our own present system of armory. The one\r\nand only civilisation which has preserved its continuity is that of the\r\nJewish race. In spite of persecution the Jews have preserved unchanged the\r\nminutest details of ritual law and ceremony, the causes of their suffering.\r\nHad heraldry, which is and has always been a matter of pride, formed a part\r\nof their distinctive life we should find it still existing. Yet the fact\r\nremains {12} that no trace of Jewish heraldry can be found until modern\r\ntimes. Consequently I accept unquestioningly the conclusions of the late J.\r\nR. Planché, Somerset Herald, who unhesitatingly asserted that armory did\r\nnot exist at the time of the Conquest, basing his conclusions principally\r\nupon the entire absence of armory from the seals of that period, and the\r\nBayeux tapestry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Kiku-non-hana-mon. State _Mon_ of Japan.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Kiri-mon. _Mon_ of the Mikado.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Awoï-mon. _Mon_ of the House of Minamoto Tokugawa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--_Mon_ of the House of Minamoto Ashikaya.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Tomoye. _Mon_ of the House of Arina.]\r\n\r\nThe family tokens (_mon_) of the Japanese, however, fulfil very nearly all\r\nof the essentials of armory, although considered heraldically they may\r\nappear somewhat peculiar to European eyes. Though perhaps never forming the\r\nentire decoration of a shield, they do appear upon weapons and armour, and\r\nare used most lavishly in the decoration of clothing, rooms, furniture, and\r\nin fact almost every conceivable object, being employed for _decorative_\r\npurposes in precisely the same manners and methods that armorial devices\r\nare decoratively made use of in this country. A Japanese of the upper\r\nclasses always has his _mon_ in three places upon his _kimono_, usually at\r\nthe back just below the collar and on either sleeve. The Japanese servants\r\nalso wear their service badge in much the same manner that in olden days\r\nthe badge was worn by the servants of a nobleman. The design of the service\r\nbadge occupies the whole available surface of the back, and is reproduced\r\nin a miniature form on each lappel of the _kimono_. Unfortunately, like\r\narmorial bearings in Europe, but to a far greater extent, the Japanese\r\n_mon_ has been greatly pirated and abused. {13}\r\n\r\nFig. 1, \"Kiku-non-hana-mon,\" formed from the conventionalised bloom\r\n(_hana_) of the chrysanthemum, is the _mon_ of the State. It is formed of\r\nsixteen petals arranged in a circle, and connected on the outer edge by\r\nsmall curves.\r\n\r\nFig. 2, \"Kiri-mon,\" is the personal _mon_ of the Mikado, formed of the\r\nleaves and flower of the _Paulowna imperialis_, conventionally treated.\r\n\r\nFig. 3, \"Awoï-mon,\" is the _mon_ of the House of Minamoto Tokugawa, and is\r\ncomposed of three sea leaves (_Asarum_).

And there can be no doubt\r\nthat the theory of armory as we now know it is governed by those two ideas.\r\nThe shields and the crests, if any decoration of a helmet is to be called a\r\ncrest, of the Greeks and the Romans undoubtedly come within the one\r\nrequirement. Also were they indicative of and perhaps intended to be\r\nsymbolical of the owner. They lacked, however, heredity, and we have no\r\nproof that the badges we read of, or the decorations of shield and helmet,\r\nwere continuous even during a single lifetime. Certainly as we now\r\nunderstand the term there must be both continuity of use, if the arms be\r\nimpersonal, or heredity if the arms be personal. Likewise must there be\r\ntheir use as decorations of the implements of warfare.\r\n\r\nIf we exact these qualifications as essential, armory as a fact and as a\r\nscience is a product of later days, and is the evolution from the idea of\r\ntribal badges and tribal means and methods of honour applied to the\r\ndecoration of implements of warfare. It is the conjunction and association\r\nof these two distinct ideas to which is added the no less important idea of\r\nheredity. The civilisation of England before the Conquest has left us no\r\ntrace of any sort or kind that the Saxons, the Danes, or the Celts either\r\nknew or practised armory. So that if armory as we know it is to be traced\r\nto the period of the Norman Conquest, we must look for it as an adjunct of\r\nthe altered civilisation and the altered law which Duke William brought\r\ninto this country. Such evidence as exists is to the contrary, and there is\r\nnothing that can be truly termed armorial in that marvellous piece of\r\ncotemporaneous workmanship known as the Bayeux tapestry.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Bayeux tapestry and the evidence it affords, Woodward and\r\nBurnett's \"Treatise on Heraldry,\" apparently following Planché's\r\nconclusions, remarks: \"The evidence afforded by the famous tapestry\r\npreserved in the public library of Bayeux, a series of views in sewed work\r\nrepresenting the invasion and conquest of England by WILLIAM the Norman,\r\nhas been appealed to on both sides of this controversy, and has certainly\r\nan important bearing on the question of the antiquity of coat-armour. This\r\npanorama of seventy-two scenes is on probable grounds believed to have been\r\nthe work of the Conqueror's Queen MATILDA and her maidens; though the\r\nFrench historian THIERRY and others ascribe it to the Empress MAUD,\r\ndaughter of HENRY III. The latest authorities suggest the likelihood of its\r\nhaving been wrought as a decoration for the Cathedral of Bayeux, when\r\nrebuilt by WILLIAM'S uterine brother ODO, Bishop of that See, in 1077. The\r\nexact correspondence which has been discovered between the length of the\r\ntapestry {15} and the inner circumference of the nave of the cathedral\r\ngreatly favours this supposition. This remarkable work of art, as carefully\r\ndrawn in colour in 1818 by Mr. C. STOTHARD, is reproduced in the sixth\r\nvolume of the _Vetusta Monumenta_; and more recently an excellent copy of\r\nit from autotype plates has been published by the Arundel Society. Each of\r\nits scenes is accompanied by a Latin description, the whole uniting into a\r\ngraphic history of the event commemorated. We see HAROLD taking leave of\r\nEDWARD THE CONFESSOR; riding to Bosham with his hawk and hounds; embarking\r\nfor France; landing there and being captured by the Count of Ponthieu;\r\nredeemed by WILLIAM of Normandy, and in the midst of his Court aiding him\r\nagainst CONAN, Count of BRETAGNE; swearing on the sacred relics to\r\nrecognise WILLIAM'S claim of succession to the English throne, and then\r\nre-embarking for England. On his return, we have him recounting the\r\nincidents of his journey to EDWARD THE CONFESSOR, to whose funeral\r\nobsequies we are next introduced. Then we have HAROLD receiving the crown\r\nfrom the English people, and ascending the throne; and WILLIAM, apprised of\r\nwhat had taken place, consulting with his half-brother ODO about invading\r\nEngland. The war preparations of the Normans, their embarkation, their\r\nlanding, their march to Hastings, and formation of a camp there, form the\r\nsubjects of successive scenes; and finally we have the battle of Hastings,\r\nwith the death of Harold and the flight of the English. In this remarkable\r\npiece of work we have figures of more than six hundred persons, and seven\r\nhundred animals, besides thirty-seven buildings, and forty-one ships or\r\nboats. There are of course also numerous shields of warriors, of which some\r\nare round, others kite-shaped, and on some of the latter are rude figures,\r\nof dragons or other imaginary animals, as well as crosses of different\r\nforms, and spots. On one hand it requires little imagination to find the\r\ncross _patée_ and the cross _botonnée_ of heraldry prefigured on two of\r\nthese shields. But there are several fatal objections to regarding these\r\nfigures as incipient _armory_, namely that while the most prominent persons\r\nof the time are depicted, most of them repeatedly, none of these is ever\r\nrepresented twice as bearing the same device, nor is there one instance of\r\nany resemblance in the rude designs described to the bearings actually used\r\nby the descendants of the persons in question. If a personage so important\r\nand so often depicted as the Conqueror had borne arms, they could not fail\r\nto have had a place in a nearly contemporary work, and more especially if\r\nit proceeded from the needle of his wife.\"\r\n\r\nLower, in his \"Curiosities of Heraldry,\" clinches the argument when he\r\nwrites: \"Nothing but disappointment awaits the curious armorist who seeks\r\nin this venerable memorial the pale, the bend, and {16} other early\r\nelements of arms. As these would have been much more easily imitated with\r\nthe needle than the grotesque figures before alluded to, we may safely\r\nconclude that personal arms had not yet been introduced.\" The \"Treatise on\r\nHeraldry\" proceeds: \"The Second Crusade took place in 1147; and in\r\nMONTFAUCON'S plates of the no longer extant windows of the Abbey of St.\r\nDenis, representing that historical episode, there is not a trace of an\r\narmorial ensign on any of the shields. That window was probably executed at\r\na date when the memory of that event was fresh; but in MONTFAUCON'S time,\r\nthe beginning of the eighteenth century, the _Science héroïque_ was matter\r\nof such moment in France that it is not to be believed that the armorial\r\nfigures on the shields, had there been any, would have been left out.\"\r\n\r\nSurely, if anywhere, we might have expected to have found evidence of\r\narmory, if it had then existed, in the Bayeux Tapestry. Neither do the\r\nseals nor the coins of the period produce a shield of arms. Nor amongst the\r\nhost of records and documents which have been preserved to us do we find\r\nany reference to armorial bearings. The intense value and estimation\r\nattached to arms in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, which has\r\nsteadily though slowly declined since that period, would lead one to\r\nsuppose that had arms existed as we know them at an earlier period, we\r\nshould have found some definite record of them in the older chronicles.\r\nThere are no such references, and no coat of arms in use at a later date\r\ncan be relegated to the Conquest or any anterior period. Of arms, as we\r\nknow them, there are _isolated examples_ in the early part of the twelfth\r\ncentury, _perhaps_ also at the end of the eleventh. At the period of the\r\nThird Crusade (1189) they were in actual existence as hereditary\r\ndecorations of weapons of warfare.\r\n\r\nLuckily, for the purposes of deductive reasoning, human nature remains much\r\nthe same throughout the ages, and, dislike it as we may, vanity now and\r\nvanity in olden days was a great lever in the determination of human\r\nactions. A noticeable result of civilisation is the effort to suppress any\r\nsign of natural emotion; and if the human race at the present day is not\r\nunmoved by a desire to render its appearance attractive, we may rest very\r\ncertainly assured that in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries this motive\r\nwas even more pronounced, and still yet more pronounced at a more remote\r\ndistance of time. Given an opportunity of ornament, there you will find\r\nornament and decoration. The ancient Britons, like the Maories of to-day,\r\nfound their opportunities restricted to their skins. The Maories tattoo\r\nthemselves in intricate patterns, the ancient Britons used woad, though\r\nhistory is silent as to whether they were content with flat colour or gave\r\ntheir preference to patterns. It is unnecessary to trace the art of {17}\r\ndecoration through embroidery upon clothes, but there is no doubt that as\r\nsoon as shields came into use they were painted and decorated, though I\r\nhesitate to follow practically the whole of heraldic writers in the\r\nstatement that it was _the necessity for distinction in battle_ which\r\naccounted for the decoration of shields. Shields were painted and\r\ndecorated, and helmets were adorned with all sorts of ornament, long\r\n_before_ the closed helmet made it impossible to recognise a man by his\r\nfacial peculiarities and distinctions. We have then this underlying\r\nprinciple of vanity, with its concomitant result of personal decoration and\r\nadornment. We have the relics of savagery which caused a man to be\r\nnicknamed from some animal. The conjunction of the two produces the effort\r\nto apply the opportunity for decoration and the vanity of the animal\r\nnickname to each other.\r\n\r\nWe are fast approaching armory. In those days every man fought, and his\r\nweapons were the most cherished of his personal possessions. The sword his\r\nfather fought with, the shield his father carried, the banner his father\r\nfollowed would naturally be amongst the articles a son would be most eager\r\nto possess. Herein are the rudiments of the idea of heredity in armory; and\r\nthe science of armory as we know it begins to slowly evolve itself from\r\nthat point, for the son would naturally take a pride in upholding the fame\r\nwhich had clustered round the pictured signs and emblems under which his\r\nfather had warred.\r\n\r\nAnother element then appeared which exercised a vast influence upon armory.\r\nEurope rang from end to end with the call to the Crusades. We may or we may\r\nnot understand the fanaticism which gripped the whole of the Christian\r\nworld and sent it forth to fight the Saracens. That has little to do with\r\nit. The result was the collection together in a comparatively restricted\r\nspace of all that was best and noblest amongst the human race at that time.\r\nAnd the spirit of emulation caused nation to vie with nation, and\r\nindividual with individual in the performance of illustrious feats of\r\nhonour. War was elevated to the dignity of a sacred duty, and the\r\nimplements of warfare rose in estimation. It is easy to understand the\r\nglory therefore that attached to arms, and the slow evolution which I have\r\nbeen endeavouring to indicate became a concrete fact, and it is due to the\r\nCrusades that the origin of armory as we now know it was practically coeval\r\nthroughout Europe, and also that a large proportion of the charges and\r\nterms and rules of heraldry are identical in all European countries.\r\n\r\nThe next dominating influence was the introduction, in the early part of\r\nthe thirteenth century, of the closed helmet. This hid the face of the\r\nwearer from his followers and necessitated some means by which the latter\r\ncould identify the man under whom they served. What more natural than that\r\nthey should identify him by the {18} decoration of his shield and the\r\nornaments of his helmet, and by the coat or surcoat which he wore over his\r\ncoat of mail?\r\n\r\nThis surcoat had afforded another opportunity of decoration, and it had\r\nbeen decorated with the same signs that the wearer had painted on his\r\nshield, hence the term \"coat of arms.\" This textile coat was in itself a\r\nproduct of the Crusades. The Crusaders went in their metal armour from the\r\ncooler atmospheres of Europe to the intolerable heat of the East. The\r\nsurcoat and the lambrequin alike protected the metal armour and the metal\r\nhelmet from the rays of the sun and the resulting discomfort to the wearer,\r\nand were also found very effective as a preventative of the rust resulting\r\nfrom rain and damp upon the metal. By the time that the closed helmet had\r\ndeveloped the necessity of distinction and the identification of a man with\r\nthe pictured signs he wore or carried, the evolution of armory into the\r\nscience we know was practically complete. {19}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE STATUS AND THE MEANING OF A COAT OF ARMS IN GREAT BRITAIN\r\n\r\nIt would be foolish and misleading to assert that the possession of a coat\r\nof arms at the present date has anything approaching the dignity which\r\nattached to it in the days of long ago; but one must trace this through the\r\ncenturies which have passed in order to form a true estimate of it, and\r\nalso to properly appreciate a coat of arms at the present time. It is\r\nnecessary to go back to the Norman Conquest and the broad dividing lines of\r\nsocial life in order to obtain a correct knowledge. The Saxons had no\r\narmory, though they had a very perfect civilisation. This civilisation\r\nWilliam the Conqueror upset, introducing in its place the system of feudal\r\ntenure with which he had been familiar on the Continent. Briefly, this\r\nfeudal system may be described as the partition of the land amongst the\r\nbarons, earls, and others, in return for which, according to the land they\r\nheld, they accepted a liability of military service for themselves and so\r\nmany followers. These barons and earls in their turn sublet the land on\r\nterms advantageous to themselves, but nevertheless requiring from those to\r\nwhom they sublet the same military service which the King had exacted from\r\nthemselves proportionate with the extent of the sublet lands. Other\r\nsubdivisions took place, but always with the same liability of military\r\nservice, until we come to those actually holding and using the lands,\r\nenjoying them subject to the liability of military service attached to\r\nthose particular lands. Every man who held land under these conditions--and\r\nit was impossible to hold land without them--was of the upper class. He was\r\n_nobilis_ or _known_, and of a rank distinct, apart, and absolutely\r\nseparate from the remainder of the population, who were at one time\r\nactually serfs, and for long enough afterwards, of no higher social\r\nposition than they had enjoyed in their period of servitude. This wide\r\ndistinction between the upper and lower classes, which existed from one end\r\nof Europe to the other, was the very root and foundation of armory. It\r\ncannot be too greatly insisted upon. There were two qualitative terms,\r\n\"gentle\" and \"simple,\" which were applied to the upper and lower classes\r\nrespectively. Though now becoming archaic and obsolete, the terms \"gentle\"\r\nand \"simple\" {20} are still occasionally to be met with used in that\r\noriginal sense; and the two adjectives \"gentle\" and \"simple,\" in the\r\neveryday meanings of the words, are derived from, and are a _later_ growth\r\nfrom the original usage with the meaning of the upper and lower classes;\r\nbecause the quality of being gentle was supposed to exist in that class of\r\nlife referred to as gentle, whilst the quality of simplicity was supposed\r\nto be an attribute of the lower class. The word gentle is derived from the\r\nLatin word _gens (gentilis)_, meaning a man, because those were _men_ who\r\nwere not serfs. Serfs and slaves were nothing accounted of. The word\r\n\"gentleman\" is a _derivative_ of the word gentle, and a gentleman was a\r\nmember of the gentle or upper class, and gentle qualities were so termed\r\nbecause they were the qualities supposed to belong to the gentle class. A\r\nman was not a gentleman, even in those days, because he happened to possess\r\npersonal qualities usually associated with the gentle class; a man was a\r\ngentleman if he belonged to the gentle or upper class and not otherwise, so\r\nthat \"gentleman\" was an identical term for one to whom the word _nobilis_\r\nwas applied, both being names for members of the upper class. To all\r\nintents and purposes at that date there was no middle class at all. The\r\nkingdom was the land; and the trading community who dwelt in the towns were\r\nof little account save as milch kine for the purposes of taxation. The\r\nsocial position conceded to them by the upper class was little, if any,\r\nmore than was conceded to the lower classes, whose life and liberties were\r\nheld very cheaply. Briefly to sum up, therefore, there were but the two\r\nclasses in existence, of which the upper class were those who held the\r\nland, who had military obligations, and who were noble, or in other words\r\ngentle. Therefore all who held land were gentlemen; because they held land\r\nthey had to lead their servants and followers into battle, and they\r\nthemselves were personally responsible for the appearance of so many\r\nfollowers, when the King summoned them to war. Now we have seen in the\r\nprevious chapter that arms became necessary to the leader that his\r\nfollowers might distinguish him in battle. Consequently all who held land\r\nhaving, because of that land, to be responsible for followers in battle,\r\nfound it necessary to use arms. The corollary is therefore evident, that\r\nall who held lands of the King were gentlemen or noble, and used arms; and\r\nas a consequence all who possessed arms were gentlemen, for they would not\r\nneed or use arms, nor was their armour of a character upon which they could\r\ndisplay arms, unless they were leaders. The leaders, we have seen, were the\r\nland-owning or upper class; therefore every one who had arms was a\r\ngentleman, and every gentleman had arms. But the status of gentlemen\r\nexisted before there were coats of arms, and the later inseparable\r\nconnection between the two was an evolution.\r\n\r\nThe preposterous prostitution of the word gentleman in these latter {21}\r\ndays is due to the almost universal attribute of human nature which\r\ndeclines to admit itself as of other than gentle rank; and in the eager\r\ndesire to write itself gentleman, it has deliberately accepted and ordained\r\na meaning to the word which it did not formerly possess, and has attributed\r\nto it and allowed it only such a definition as would enable almost anybody\r\nto be included within its ranks.\r\n\r\nThe word gentleman nowadays has become meaningless as a word in an ordinary\r\nvocabulary; and to use the word with its original and true meaning, it is\r\nnecessary to now consider it as purely a technical term. We are so\r\naccustomed to employ the word nowadays in its unrestricted usage that we\r\nare apt to overlook the fact that such a usage is comparatively modern. The\r\nfollowing extract from \"The Right to Bear Arms\" will prove that its real\r\nmeaning was understood and was decided by law so late as the seventeenth\r\ncentury to be \"a man entitled to bear arms\":--\r\n\r\n    \"The following case in the Earl Marshal's Court, which hung upon the\r\n    definition of the word, conclusively proves my contention:--\r\n\r\n    \"'_21st November 1637._--W. Baker, gent., humbly sheweth that having\r\n    some occasion of conference with Adam Spencer of Broughton under the\r\n    Bleane, co. Cant., on or about 28th July last, the said Adam did in\r\n    most base and opprobrious tearmes abuse your petitioner, calling him a\r\n    base, lying fellow, &c. &c. The defendant pleaded that Baker is noe\r\n    Gentleman, and soe not capable of redresse in this court. Le Neve,\r\n    Clarenceux, is directed to examine the point raised, and having done\r\n    so, declared as touching the gentry of William Baker, that Robert\r\n    Cooke, Clarenceux King of Arms, did make a declaration 10th May 1573,\r\n    under his hand and seale of office, that George Baker of London, sonne\r\n    of J. Baker of the same place, sonne of Simon Baker of Feversham, co.\r\n    Cant., was a bearer of tokens of honour, and did allow and confirm to\r\n    the said George Baker and to his posterity, and to the posterity of\r\n    Christopher Baker, these Arms, &c. &c. And further, Le Neve has\r\n    received proof that the petitioner, William Baker, is the son of\r\n    William Baker of Kingsdowne, co. Cant., who was the brother of George\r\n    Baker, and son of Christopher aforesaid.' The judgment is not stated.\r\n    (The original Confirmation of Arms by Cooke, 10th May 1573, may now be\r\n    seen in the British Museum.--_Genealogist_ for 1889, p. 242.)\"\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that originally practically all who held land bore arms.\r\nIt has also been shown that armory was an evolution, and as a consequence\r\nit did not start, in this country at any rate, as a ready-made science with\r\nall its rules and laws completely known or promulgated. There is not the\r\nslightest doubt that, in the earliest infancy of the science, arms were\r\nassumed and chosen without the control of the Crown; and one would not be\r\nfar wrong in assuming that, so long as the rights accruing from prior\r\nappropriation of other people were respected, a landowner finding the\r\nnecessity of arms in battle, was originally at liberty to assume what arms\r\nhe liked.\r\n\r\nThat period, however, was of but brief duration, for we find as early {22}\r\nas 1390, from the celebrated Scrope and Grosvenor case, (1) that a man\r\ncould have obtained at that time a definite right to his arms, (2) that\r\nthis right could be enforced against another, and we find, what is more\r\nimportant, (3) that the Crown and the Sovereign had supreme control and\r\njurisdiction over arms, and (4) that the Sovereign could and did grant\r\narms. From that date down to the present time the Crown, both by its own\r\ndirect action and by the action of the Kings of Arms to whom it delegates\r\npowers for the purpose, in Letters Patent under the Great Seal,\r\nspecifically issued to each separate King of Arms upon his appointment, has\r\ncontinued to grant armorial bearings. Some number of early grants of arms\r\ndirect from the Crown have been printed in the _Genealogical Magazine_, and\r\nsome of the earliest distinctly recite that the recipients are made noble\r\nand created gentlemen, and that the arms are given them as _the sign of\r\ntheir nobility_. The class of persons to whom grants of arms were made in\r\nthe earliest days of such instruments is much the same as the class which\r\nobtain grants of arms at the present day, and the successful trader or\r\nmerchant is now at liberty, as he was in the reign of Henry VIII. and\r\nearlier, to raise himself to the rank of a gentleman by obtaining a grant\r\nof arms. A family must make its start at some time or other; let this start\r\nbe made honestly, and not by the appropriation of the arms of some other\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe illegal assumption of arms began at an early date; and in spite of the\r\nefforts of the Crown, which have been more or less continuous and repeated,\r\nit has been found that the use of \"other people's\" arms has continued. In\r\nthe reign of Henry V. a very stringent proclamation was issued on the\r\nsubject; and in the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and her successors, the Kings\r\nof Arms were commanded to make perambulations throughout the country for\r\nthe purpose of pulling down and defacing improper arms, of recording arms\r\nproperly borne by authority, and of compelling those who used arms without\r\nauthority to obtain authority for them or discontinue their use. These\r\nperambulations were termed Visitations. The subject of Visitations, and in\r\nfact the whole subject of the right to bear arms, is dealt with at length\r\nin the book to which reference has been already made, namely, \"The Right to\r\nBear Arms.\"\r\n\r\nThe glory of a descent from a long line of armigerous ancestors, the glory\r\nand the pride of race inseparably interwoven with the inheritance of a name\r\nwhich has been famous in history, the fact that some arms have been\r\ndesigned to commemorate heroic achievements, the fact that the display of a\r\nparticular coat of arms has been the method, which society has\r\ncountenanced, of advertising to the world that one is of the upper class or\r\na descendant of some ancestor who performed some glorious deed to which the\r\narms have reference, the fact that arms themselves are the very sign of a\r\nparticular descent or of a particular {23} rank, have all tended to cause a\r\nfalse and fictitious value to be placed upon all these pictured emblems\r\nwhich as a whole they have never possessed, and which I believe they were\r\nnever intended to possess. It is _because_ they were the prerogative and\r\nthe sign of aristocracy that they have been coveted so greatly, and\r\nconsequently so often assumed improperly. Now aristocracy and social\r\nposition are largely a matter of personal assertion. A man assumes and\r\nasserts for himself a certain position, which position is gradually and\r\nimperceptibly but continuously increased and elevated as its assertion is\r\nreiterated. There is no particular moment in a man's life at the present\r\ntime, the era of the great middle class, at which he visibly steps from a\r\nplebeian to a patrician standing. And when he has fought and talked the\r\nworld into conceding him a recognised position in the upper classes, he\r\nnaturally tries to obliterate the fact that he or \"his people\" were ever of\r\nany other social position, and he hesitates to perpetually date his\r\nelevation to the rank of gentility by obtaining a grant of arms and thereby\r\nadmitting that before that date he and his people were plebeian.\r\nConsequently he waits until some circumstance compels an application for a\r\ngrant, and the consequence is that he thereby post-dates his actual\r\ntechnical gentility to a period long subsequent to the recognition by\r\nSociety of his position in the upper classes.\r\n\r\nArms are the sign of the technical rank of gentility. The possession of\r\narms is a matter of hereditary privilege, which privilege the Crown is\r\nwilling should be obtained upon certain terms by any who care to possess\r\nit, who live according to the style and custom which is usual amongst\r\ngentle people. And so long as the possession of arms is a matter of\r\nprivilege, even though this privilege is no greater than is consequent upon\r\npayment of certain fees to the Crown and its officers; for so long will\r\nthat privilege possess a certain prestige and value, though this may not be\r\nvery great. Arms have never possessed any greater value than attaches to a\r\nmatter of privilege; and (with singularly few exceptions) in every case, be\r\nit of a peer or baronet, of knight or of simple gentleman, this privilege\r\nhas been obtained or has been regularised by the payment at some time or\r\nother of fees to the Crown and its officers. And the _only_ difference\r\nbetween arms granted and paid for yesterday and arms granted and paid for\r\nfive hundred years ago is the simple moral difference which attaches to the\r\ndates at which the payments were made.\r\n\r\nGentility is merely hereditary rank, emanating, with all other rank, from\r\nthe Crown, the sole fountain of honour. It is idle to make the word carry a\r\nhost of meanings it was never intended to. Arms being the sign of the\r\ntechnical rank of gentility, the use of arms is the advertisement of one's\r\nclaim to that gentility. Arms mean nothing more. By {24} coronet,\r\nsupporters, and helmet can be indicated one's place in the scale of\r\nprecedence; by adding arms for your wife you assert that she also is of\r\ngentle rank; your quarterings show the other gentle families you represent;\r\ndifference marks will show your position in your own family (not a very\r\nimportant matter); augmentations indicate the deeds of your ancestors which\r\nthe Sovereign thought worthy of being held in especial remembrance. _By the\r\nuse of a certain coat of arms, you assert your descent from the person to\r\nwhom those arms were granted, confirmed, or allowed._ That is the beginning\r\nand end of armory. Why seek to make it mean more?\r\n\r\nHowever heraldry is looked upon, it must be admitted that from its earliest\r\ninfancy armory possessed two essential qualities. It was the definite sign\r\nof hereditary nobility and rank, and it was practically an integral part of\r\nwarfare; but also from its earliest infancy it formed a means of\r\ndecoration. It would be a rash statement to assert that armory has lost its\r\nactual military character even now, but it certainly possessed it\r\nundiminished so long as tournaments took place, for the armory of the\r\ntournament was of a much higher standard than the armory of the\r\nbattlefield. Armory as an actual part of warfare existed as a means of\r\ndecoration for the implements of warfare, and as such it certainly\r\ncontinues in some slight degree to the present day.\r\n\r\nArmory in that bygone age, although it existed as the symbol of the lowest\r\nhereditary rank, was worn and used in warfare, for purposes of pageantry,\r\nfor the indication of ownership, for decorative purposes, for the needs of\r\nauthenticity in seals, and for the purposes of memorials in records,\r\npedigrees, and monuments. All those uses and purposes of armory can be\r\ntraced back to a period coeval with that to which our certain knowledge of\r\nthe existence of armory runs. Of all those usages and purposes, one only,\r\nthat of the use of armorial bearings in actual battle, can be said to have\r\ncome to an end, and even that not entirely so; the rest are still with us\r\nin actual and extensive existence. I am not versed in the minutiæ of army\r\nmatters or army history, but I think I am correct in saying that there was\r\nno such thing as a regular standing army or a national army until the reign\r\nof Henry VIII. Prior to that time the methods of the feudal system supplied\r\nthe wants of the country. The actual troops were in the employment, not of\r\nthe Crown, but of the individual leaders. The Sovereign called upon, and\r\nhad the right to call upon, those leaders to provide troops; but as those\r\ntroops were not in the direct employment of the Crown, they wore the\r\nliveries and heraldic devices of their leaders. The leaders wore their own\r\ndevices, originally for decorative reasons, and later that they might be\r\ndistinguished by their particular followers: hence the actual use in battle\r\nin former days of private armorial bearings. And even yet the {25} practice\r\nis not wholly extinguished, for the tartans of the Gordon and Cameron\r\nHighlanders are a relic of the usages of these former days. With the\r\nformation of a standing army, and the direct service of the troops to the\r\nCrown, the liveries and badges of those who had formerly been responsible\r\nfor the troops gave way to the liveries and badges of the Crown. The\r\nuniform of the Beefeaters is a good example of the method in which in the\r\nold days a servant wore the badge and livery of his lord. The Beefeaters\r\nwear the scarlet livery of the Sovereign, and wear the badge of the\r\nSovereign still. Many people will tell you, by the way, that the uniform of\r\na Beefeater is identical now with what it was in the days of Henry VIII. It\r\nisn't. In accordance with the strictest laws of armory, the badge,\r\nembroidered on the front and back of the tunic, has changed, and is now the\r\ntriple badge--the rose, the thistle, and the shamrock--of the triple\r\nkingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Every soldier who wears a scarlet\r\ncoat, the livery of his Sovereign, every regiment that carries its colours,\r\nevery saddle-cloth with a Royal emblem thereupon, is evidence that the use\r\nof armory in battle still exists in a small degree to the present day; but\r\ncircumstances have altered. The troops no longer attack to the cry of \"A\r\nWarwick! a Warwick!\" they serve His Majesty the King and wear his livery\r\nand devices. They no longer carry the banner of their officer, whose\r\nservants and tenants they would formerly have been; the regiment cherishes\r\ninstead the banner of the armorial bearings of His Majesty. Within the last\r\nfew years, probably within the lifetime of all my readers, there has been\r\nstriking evidence of the manner in which circumstances alter everything.\r\nThe Zulu War put an end to the practice of taking the colours of a regiment\r\ninto battle; the South African War saw khaki substituted universally for\r\nthe scarlet livery of His Majesty; and to have found upon a South African\r\nbattlefield the last remnant of the armorial practices of the days of\r\nchivalry, one would have needed, I am afraid, to examine the buttons of the\r\ntroopers. Still the scarlet coat exists in the army on parade: the Life\r\nGuards wear the Royal Cross of St. George and the Star of the Garter, the\r\nScots Greys have the Royal Saltire of St. Andrew, and the Gordon\r\nHighlanders have the Gordon crest of the Duke of Richmond and Gordon; and\r\nthere are many other similar instances.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another point. The band of a regiment is maintained by the\r\nofficers of the regiment, and at the present day in the Scottish regiments\r\nthe pipers have attached to their pipes banners bearing the various\r\n_personal_ armorial bearings of the officers of the regiment. So that\r\nperhaps one is justified in saying that the use of armorial bearings in\r\nwarfare has not yet come to an end. The other ancient usages of armory\r\nexist now as they existed in the earliest times. So that it is {26} foolish\r\nto contend that armory has ceased to exist, save as an interesting survival\r\nof the past. It is a living reality, more _widely_ in use at the present\r\nday than ever before.\r\n\r\nCertainly the military side of armory has sunk in importance till it is now\r\nutterly overshadowed by the decorative, but the fact that armory still\r\nexists as the sign and adjunct of hereditary rank utterly forbids one to\r\nassert that armory is dead, and though this side of armory is also now\r\npartly overshadowed by its decorative use, armory must be admitted to be\r\nstill alive whilst its laws can still be altered. When, if ever, rank is\r\nfinally swept away, and when the Crown ceases to grant arms, and people\r\ncease to use them, then armory will be dead, and can be treated as the\r\nstudy of a dead science. {27}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE HERALDS AND OFFICERS OF ARMS\r\n\r\nThe crown is the Fountain of Honour, having supreme control of coat-armour.\r\nThis control in all civilised countries is one of the appanages of\r\nsovereignty, but from an early period much of the actual control has been\r\ndelegated to the Heralds and Kings of Arms. The word Herald is derived from\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon--_here_, an army, and _wald_, strength or sway--though it\r\nhas probably come to us from the German word _Herold_.\r\n\r\nIn the last years of the twelfth century there appeared at festal\r\ngatherings persons mostly habited in richly coloured clothing, who\r\ndelivered invitations to the guests, and, side by side with the stewards,\r\nsuperintended the festivities. Many of them were minstrels, who, after\r\ntournaments or battle, extolled the deeds of the victors. These individuals\r\nwere known in Germany as _Garzune_.\r\n\r\nOriginally every powerful leader had his own herald, and the dual character\r\nof minstrel and messenger led the herald to recount the deeds of his\r\nmaster, and, as a natural consequence, of his master's ancestors. In token\r\nof their office they wore the coats of arms of the leaders they served; and\r\nthe original status of a herald was that of a non-combatant messenger. When\r\ntournaments came into vogue it was natural that some one should examine the\r\narms of those taking part, and from this the duties of the herald came to\r\ninclude a knowledge of coat-armour. As the Sovereign assumed or arrogated\r\nthe control of arms, the right to grant arms, and the right of judgment in\r\ndisputes concerning arms, it was but the natural result that the personal\r\nheralds of the Sovereign should be required to have a knowledge of the arms\r\nof his principal subjects, and should obtain something in the nature of a\r\ncognisance or control and jurisdiction over those arms; for doubtless the\r\nactions of the Sovereign would often depend upon the knowledge of his\r\nheralds.\r\n\r\nThe process of development in this country will be more easily understood\r\nwhen it is remembered that the Marshal or Earl Marshal was in former times,\r\nwith the Lord High Constable, the first in _military_ rank under the King,\r\nwho usually led his army in person, and to {28} the Marshal was deputed the\r\nordering and arrangement of the various bodies of troops, regiments, bands\r\nof retainers, &c., which ordering was at first facilitated and at length\r\nentirely determined by the use of various pictorial ensigns, such as\r\nstandards, banners, crests, cognisances, and badges. The due arrangement\r\nand knowledge of these various ensigns became first the necessary study and\r\nthen the ordinary duty of these officers of the Marshal, and their\r\npossession of such knowledge, which soon in due course had to be written\r\ndown and tabulated, secured to them an important part in mediæval life. The\r\nresult was that at an early period we find them employed in semi-diplomatic\r\nmissions, such as carrying on negotiations between contending armies on the\r\nfield, bearing declarations of war, challenges from one sovereign to\r\nanother, besides arranging the ceremonial not only of battles and\r\ntournaments, but also of coronations, Royal baptisms, marriages, and\r\nfunerals.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that neither King of Arms nor Herald is mentioned as\r\nofficiating in the celebrated Scrope and Grosvenor case, of which very full\r\nparticulars have come down to us, it is evident that the control of arms\r\nhad not passed either in fact or in theory from the Crown to the officers\r\nof arms at that date. Konrad Grünenberg, in his _Wappencodex_ (\"Roll of\r\nArms\"), the date of which is 1483, gives a representation of a _helmschau_\r\n(literally helmet-show), here reproduced (Fig. 12), which includes the\r\nfigure of a herald. Long before that date, however, the position of a\r\nherald in England was well defined, for we find that on January 5, 1420,\r\nthe King appointed William Bruges to be Garter King of Arms. It is usually\r\nconsidered in England that it would be found that in Germany armory reached\r\nits highest point of evolution. Certainly German heraldic art is in advance\r\nof our own, and it is curious to read in the latest and one of the best of\r\nGerman heraldic books that \"from the very earliest times heraldry was\r\ncarried to a higher degree of perfection and thoroughness in England than\r\nelsewhere, and that it has maintained itself at the same level until the\r\npresent day. In other countries, for the most part, heralds no longer have\r\nany existence but in name.\" The initial figure which appears at the\r\ncommencement of Chapter I. represents John Smert, Garter King of Arms, and\r\nis taken from the grant of arms issued by him to the Tallow Chandlers'\r\nCompany of London, which is dated September 24, 1456.\r\n\r\nLong before there was any College of Arms, the Marshal, afterwards the Earl\r\nMarshal, had been appointed. The Earl Marshal is now head of the College of\r\nArms, and to him has been delegated the whole of the control both of armory\r\nand of the College, with the exception of that part which the Crown has\r\nretained in its own hands. {29} After the Earl Marshal come the Kings of\r\nArms, the Heralds of Arms, and the Pursuivants of Arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--_Helmschau_ or Helmet-Show. (From Konrad\r\nGrünenberg's _Wappencodex zu München_.) End of fifteenth century.]\r\n\r\nThe title of King of Arms, or, as it was more anciently written, King of\r\nHeralds, was no doubt originally given to the chief or principal officer,\r\nwho presided over the heralds of a kingdom, or some principal province,\r\nwhich heraldic writers formerly termed _marches_; or else the title was\r\nconferred upon the officer of arms attendant upon some particular order of\r\nknighthood. Garter King of Arms, who is immediately attached to that\r\nillustrious order, is likewise Principal King of Arms, and these, although\r\nseparate and distinct offices, are and have been always united in one\r\nperson. Upon the revival and new modelling of the Order of the Bath, in the\r\nreign of George the First, a King of Arms was created and attached to it,\r\nby the title of Bath King of Arms; and King George III., upon the\r\ninstitution of the Hanoverian Guelphic Order of Knighthood, annexed to that\r\norder a King of Arms, by the appellation of Hanover. At the time of the\r\ncreation of his office, Bath King of Arms was given Wales as his province,\r\nthe intention being that he should rank with the others, granting arms in\r\nhis own province, but he was not, nor was Hanover, nor is the King of Arms\r\nof the Order of St. Michael and St. George, a member (as such) of the\r\ncorporation of the College of Arms. The members of that corporation\r\nconsidered that the gift of the province of Wales, the jurisdiction over\r\nwhich they had previously possessed, to Bath King was an infringement of\r\ntheir chartered privileges. The dispute was referred to the law officers of\r\nthe Crown, whose opinion was in favour of the corporate body.\r\n\r\nBerry in his _Encyclopædia Heraldica_ further remarks: \"The Kings of Arms\r\nof the provincial territories have the titles of _Clarenceux_ and _Norroy_,\r\nthe jurisdiction of the former extending over the south, east, and west\r\nparts of England, from the river Trent southwards; and that of the latter,\r\nthe remaining part of the kingdom northward of that river. Kings of Arms\r\nhave been likewise assigned other provinces over different kingdoms and\r\ndominions, and besides Ulster King of Arms for Ireland, and Lyon King of\r\nArms for Scotland, others were nominated for particular provinces abroad,\r\nwhen united to the Crown of England, such as _Aquitaine_, _Anjou_, and\r\n_Guyenne_, who were perhaps at their first creation intended only for the\r\nservices of the places whose titles they bore, when the same should be\r\nentirely subdued to allegiance to the Crown of England, and who, till that\r\ntime, might have had other provinces allotted to them, either provisionally\r\nor temporarily, within the realm of England.\r\n\r\nThere were also other Kings of Arms, denominated from the dukedoms or\r\nearldoms which our princes enjoyed before they came to the throne, as\r\n_Lancaster_, _Gloucester_, _Richmond_, and _Leicester_, the three first\r\n{30} having marches, or provinces, and the latter a similar jurisdiction.\r\nWindsor, likewise, was a local title, but it is doubtful whether that\r\nofficer was ever a King of Arms. _Marche_ also assumed that appellation,\r\nfrom his provincial jurisdiction over a territory so called.\r\n\r\nBut although anciently there were at different periods several Kings of\r\nArms in England, only two provincial Kings of Arms have, for some ages,\r\nbeen continued in office, viz. Clarenceux and Norroy, whose provinces or\r\nmarches are, as before observed, separated by the river Trent, the ancient\r\nlimits of the escheaters, when there are only two in the kingdom, and the\r\njurisdiction of the wardens of the forests.\r\n\r\n_Norroy_ is considered the most ancient title, being the only one in\r\nEngland taken from the local situation of his province, unless _Marche_\r\nshould be derived from the same cause. The title of _Norroy_ was anciently\r\nwritten _Norreys_ and _Norreis_, King of Arms of the people residing in the\r\nnorth; _Garter_ being styled _Roy des Anglois_, of the people, and not\r\n_d'Angleterre_, of the kingdom, the inhabitants of the north being called\r\n_Norreys_,[1] as we are informed by ancient historians.\r\n\r\nIt appears that there was a King of Arms for the parts or people on the\r\nnorth of Trent as early as the reign of Edward I., from which, as Sir Henry\r\nSpelman observes, it may be inferred that the southern, eastern, and\r\nwestern parts had principal heralds, or Kings of Arms, although their\r\ntitles at that early age cannot now be ascertained.\r\n\r\n_Norroy_ had not the title of King till after the reign of Edward II. It\r\nwas appropriated to a King of Heralds, expressly called _Rex Norroy_, _Roy\r\nd'Armes del North_, _Rex Armorum del North_, _Rex de North_, and _Rex\r\nNorroy du North_; and the term _Roy Norreys_ likewise occurs in the Pell\r\nRolls of the 22nd Edward III.; but from that time till the 9th of Richard\r\nII. no farther mention is made of any such officer, from which it is\r\nprobable a different person enjoyed the office by some other title during\r\nthat interval, particularly as the office was actually executed by other\r\nKings of Arms, immediately after that period. _John Otharlake, Marche King\r\nof Arms_, executed it in the 9th of Richard II., Richard del Brugg,\r\nLancaster King of Arms, 1st Henry IV., and _Ashwell_, _Boys_, and _Tindal_,\r\nsuccessively _Lancaster Kings of Arms_, until the end of that monarch's\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nEdward IV. replaced this province under a King of Arms, and revived the\r\ndormant title of _Norroy_. But in the Statute of Resumptions, {31} made 1st\r\nHenry VII., a clause was inserted that the same should not extend to _John\r\nMoore_, otherwise _Norroy_, chief Herald King of Arms of the north parts of\r\nthis realm of England, so appointed by King Edward IV. by his Letters\r\nPatent, bearing date 9th July, in the eighteenth year of his reign. It has\r\nsince continued without interruption.\r\n\r\n_Falcon King of Arms_ seems the next who had the title of King conferred\r\nupon him, and was so named from one of the Royal badges of King Edward\r\nIII., and it was afterwards given to a herald and pursuivant, under princes\r\nwho bore the falcon as a badge or cognisance, and it is difficult to\r\nascertain whether this officer was considered a king, herald, or\r\npursuivant. _Froissart_ in 1395 calls _Faucon_ only a herald, and in 1364\r\nmentions this officer as a King of Arms belonging to the King of England;\r\nbut it is certain that in the 18th Richard II. there was a King of Arms by\r\nthat appellation, and so continued until the reign of Richard III., if not\r\nlater; but at what particular period of time the officer was discontinued\r\ncannot be correctly ascertained.\r\n\r\n_Windsor_ has been considered by some writers to have been the title of a\r\nKing of Arms, from an abbreviation in some old records, which might be\r\notherwise translated. There is, however, amongst the Protections in the\r\nTower of London, one granted in the 49th Edward III. to _Stephen de\r\nWindesore, Heraldo Armorum rege dicto_, which seems to favour the\r\nconjecture, and other records might be quoted for and against this\r\nsupposition, which might have arisen through mistake in the entries, as\r\nthey contradict one another.\r\n\r\n_Marche_ seems the next in point of antiquity of creation; but although Sir\r\nHenry Spelman says that King Edward IV. descended from the _Earls of\r\nMarche_, promoted _Marche Herald_ to be a King of Arms, giving him,\r\nperhaps, the marches for his province, it is pretty clearly ascertained\r\nthat it was of a more early date, from the express mention of _March Rex\r\nHeraldorum_ and _March Rex Heraldus_ in records of the time of Richard II.,\r\nthough it may be possible that it was then only a nominal title, and did\r\nnot become a real one till the reign of Edward IV., as mentioned by\r\nSpelman.\r\n\r\n_Lancaster King of Arms_ was, as the same author informs us, so created by\r\nHenry IV. in relation to his own descent from the Lancastrian family, and\r\nthe county of Lancaster assigned to him as his province; but _Edmondson_\r\ncontends \"that that monarch superadded the title of Lancaster to that of\r\nNorroy, or King of the North, having, as it may be reasonably conjectured,\r\ngiven this province north of Trent, within which district Lancaster was\r\nsituated, to him who had been formerly his officer of arms, by the title of\r\nthat dukedom, and who might, according to custom, in some instances of\r\nformer ages, retain his former title and surname of heraldship, styling\r\nhimself _Lancaster Roy d'Armes del North_.\" {32}\r\n\r\n_Leicester King of Arms_ was a title similar to that of _Lancaster_, and\r\nlikewise a creation to the same Sovereign, Henry IV., who was also Earl of\r\nLeicester before he assumed the crown, and was given to a person who was\r\nbefore that time a herald. It appears that _Henry Grene_ was _Leicester\r\nHerald_, 9th King Richard II., and in the 13th of the same reign is called\r\na _Herald of the Duke of Guyen and Lancaster_, but prior to the coronation\r\nof Henry IV. he was certainly a King of Heralds, and so styled in a privy\r\nseal dated antecedent to that ceremony. A similar instrument of the tenth\r\nyear of that monarch's reign also mentions _Henry Grene_, otherwise\r\n_Leicester King of Arms_.\r\n\r\nAs it is evident that, during the reign of Henry IV., _Lancaster King of\r\nArms_ has under that title the province of the north, _Mr. Edmondson_, with\r\ngood reason, supposes that the southern province, or part of that which is\r\nnow under Clarenceux, might at that time be under this _Leicester_,\r\nespecially as the title of _Clarenceux_ was not in being till after the 3rd\r\nof Henry V., when, or soon after, the title of _Leicester_ might have\r\nbecome extinct by the death of that officer; for although _Leicester King\r\nof Arms_ went over into France with Henry V. in the third year of his\r\nreign, yet he is not mentioned in the constitutions made by the heralds at\r\nRoan in the year 1419-20.\r\n\r\n_Clarenceux_, the next King of Arms in point of creation, is a title\r\ngenerally supposed to have been taken from _Clare_, in Suffolk, the castle\r\nat that place being the principal residence of the ancient Earls of\r\nHereford, who were, from thence, though very improperly, called _Earls of\r\nClare_, in the same manner as the Earls of Pembroke were often named _Earls\r\nof Strigoil and Chepstow_; the Earl of Hampshire, _Earl of Winchester_; the\r\nEarl of Derby, _Earl of Tuttebury_; the Earl of Sussex, _Earl of\r\nChichester_, &c. King Edward III. created his third son Lionel _Duke of\r\nClarence_, instead of the monosyllable _Clare_ (from his marriage with the\r\ngrand-daughter of the late Earl), but Lionel dying without issue male,\r\nHenry IV. created his younger son Thomas _Duke of Clarence_, who being\r\nslain without issue 9th of Henry V., the honour remained in the Crown,\r\nuntil King Edward IV. conferred it upon his own brother. Mr. Sandford tells\r\nus that _Clarence_ is the country about the town, castle, and honour of\r\n_Clare_, from which duchy the name of _Clarenceux King of Arms_ is derived.\r\nSpelman, however, contends that it is a mistake in attributing the\r\ninstitution of _Clarenceux_ to King Edward IV. after the honour of\r\n_Clarence_ devolved as an escheat to the Crown upon the untimely death of\r\nhis brother George, as he found William Horsely called by this title in the\r\nreign of Henry V. and also Roger Lygh, under King Henry VI.; and it is\r\nconjectured that the office of _Clarenceux King of Arms_ is not more\r\nancient than the reign of Edward III.\r\n\r\n_Gloucester Herald_, frequently mentioned by historians, was originally\r\n{33} the herald of the great Humphry, Duke of Gloucester, of whom mention\r\nis made upon record in the 10th of Henry VI.; and Richard, brother to\r\nEdward IV., who was created Duke of Gloucester, is said to have had a\r\nherald by that title during the reign of his brother, and who was attendant\r\nas such at the funeral of that monarch. In a manuscript in the Ashmolean\r\ncollection, it is stated that Richard Champnay attended as Gloucester King\r\nof Arms at the coronation of Richard III. upon the 7th July following his\r\nusurpation of the crown; but it appears by more authentic record that this\r\nRichard Champnay was, by the style and title of Herald of Arms, on the 18th\r\nSeptember, in the first year of his usurpation, by patent created a King of\r\nArms and Principal Herald of the parts of Wales, by the style and title of\r\nGloucester, giving him licence and authority to execute all and singular\r\nthat by law or custom in former times belonged to the office of King of\r\nArms. It is supposed that the office ceased upon his death, which in all\r\nprobability took place before that of the usurper.\r\n\r\n_Richmond King of Arms._--A herald called _Richmond_ is frequently\r\nmentioned, as well belonging to the Crown as of the nobility. But the\r\nrecords of the reign of King Henry VII., who had before his elevation to\r\nthe throne been Earl of Richmond, contain many entries of _Richmond King of\r\nArms_; but although somewhat vague in the description, sufficiently bear\r\nout the conjecture that Henry VII., previous to his coronation, created a\r\nnew King of Arms by the title of _Richmond_, although no regular patent of\r\ncreation has ever been found.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Spelman informs us that, in addition to the two Kings of Arms for\r\nthe two Heraldic provinces bounded north and south by the river Trent,\r\nthere were also two provincial kings for the dominions of our Sovereign in\r\nFrance, styled _Guyenne_ and _Agincourt_ (omitting _Aquitaine_ and _Anjou_,\r\nwhich were certainly in being at the same time), and another for _Ireland_\r\nby that name, altered by King Edward VI. into _Ulster_.\r\n\r\n_Ireland King of Arms_ first occurs upon record 6th Richard II., anno 1482,\r\nmentioned by _Froissart_, where he is called _Chandos le Roy d'Ireland_. A\r\nregular succession of officers, by the title of Ireland King of Arms,\r\ncontinued from that time till the reign of King Edward IV., but from the\r\ndeath of that monarch till the creation of Ulster by Edward VI. it is\r\nuncertain whether the title existed, or what became of the office.\r\n\r\nEdward VI. altered the title of Ireland King of Arms into that of Ulster,\r\nor rather considered it as a new institution, from the words of his\r\njournal: \"Feb. 2. There was a King of Arms made for Ireland, whose name was\r\n_Ulster_, and his province was all Ireland; and he was the fourth King of\r\nArms, and the first Herald of Ireland.\" The patent passed under the Great\r\nSeal of England.\r\n\r\nGuyenne, a part of Aquitaine, in France, a province belonging to {34} the\r\nBritish Crown, gave title not only to a King of Arms, but to a herald\r\nlikewise, and Sir Henry Spelman dates its creation in the time of Edward\r\nI., although it is somewhat doubtful, and thought to be in the reign of\r\nEdward III. Guyenne Herald appears upon record during the reign of Henry\r\nVI., and though Kings of Arms were frequently styled heralds in old\r\nrecords, it is more than probable both offices were in existence at the\r\nsame time. From the time of Edward IV. no such officers belonging to the\r\nCrown of England seem to have been continued, and it is doubtful whether\r\nthey ever held in constant succession from their first creation.\r\n\r\n_Aquitaine_, which included what were afterwards called Guyenne, Xantoigne,\r\nGascoigne, and some islands, gave title to a King of Heralds as early as\r\nthe reign of Edward III., and it is conjectured to have been an officer\r\nbelonging to the Black Prince, who had the principality of Aquitaine given\r\nto him by his father; but although this officer is mentioned in the reign\r\nof Richard II. and 3rd of Henry V., no record occurs after the latter\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n_Agincourt_ was also a title conferred upon a herald, in memory of that\r\nsignal victory; and lands were granted to him for life, 6th Henry V., as\r\nmentioned by Sir Henry Spelman; but whether the office was continued, or\r\nany particular province assigned to this officer, cannot be ascertained.\r\n\r\n_Anjou King of Arms_ was likewise an officer of King Henry VI., and\r\nattendant upon John, Duke of Bedford, when Regent of France, who assumed\r\nthe title of Duke of Anjou. But upon the death of the Duke of Bedford, this\r\nofficer was promoted to Lancaster King of Arms; and in all probability the\r\ntitle of Anjou, as a King of Heralds, was discontinued.\r\n\r\n_Volant_ also occurs upon record in the 28th Edward III., and _Vaillant_,\r\n_le Roy Vaillant Heraud_, and _le Roy Vailland_, are likewise mentioned in\r\n1395.\r\n\r\nHenry V. instituted the office of Garter King of Arms; but at what\r\nparticular period is rather uncertain, although Mr. Anstis has clearly\r\nproved that it must have taken place after the 22nd May, and before the 3rd\r\nSeptember, in the year 1417.\r\n\r\nStephen Martin Leake, Esq., who filled the office, sums up its duties in\r\nthe following words: \"_Garter_ was instituted by King Henry V., A.D. 1417,\r\nfor the service of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, which was made\r\nsovereign within the office of arms over all other officers, subject to the\r\nCrown of England, by the name of Garter King of Arms of England. In this\r\npatent he is styled Principal King of English Arms, and Principal Officer\r\nof Arms of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, and has power to execute the\r\nsaid office by himself or deputy, being an herald. By the constitution of\r\nhis office, he must be a native of {35} England, and a gentleman bearing\r\narms. To him belongs the correction of arms, and all ensigns of honour,\r\nusurped or borne unjustly, and also to grant arms to deserving persons, and\r\nsupporters to the nobility and Knights of the Bath; to go next before the\r\nsword in solemn proceeding, none interposing, except the constable and\r\nmarshal; to administer the oath to all the officers of arms; to have a\r\nhabit like the registrar of the order; baron's service in the court;\r\nlodgings in Windsor Castle; to bear his white rod with a banner of the\r\nensigns of the order thereon before the Sovereign; also when any lord shall\r\nenter the Parliament chamber, to assign him his place, according to his\r\ndignity and degree; to carry the ensign of the order to foreign princes,\r\nand to do, or procure to be done, what the Sovereign shall enjoin, relating\r\nto the order; with other duties incident to his office of principal King of\r\nArms, for the execution whereof he hath a salary of one hundred pounds a\r\nyear, payable at the Exchequer, and an hundred pounds more out of the\r\nrevenue of the order, besides fees.\"\r\n\r\n_Bath King of Arms_ was created 11th George I., in conformity with the\r\nstatutes established by His Majesty for the government of the Order of the\r\nBath, and in obedience to those statutes was nominated and created by the\r\nGreat Master of the Order denominated _Bath_, and in Latin, _Rex armorum\r\nHonoratissimi Ordinis Militaris de Balneo_. These statutes direct that this\r\nofficer shall, in all the ceremonies of the order, be habited in a white\r\nmantle lined with red, having on the right shoulder the badge of the order,\r\nand under it a surcoat of white silk, lined and edged with red; that he\r\nshall wear on his breast, hanging to a golden chain about his neck, an\r\nescocheon of gold, enamelled with the arms of the order, impaling the arms\r\nof the Sovereign, crowned with the Imperial crown. That at all coronations\r\nhe shall precede the companions of the order, and shall carry and wear his\r\ncrown as other Kings of Arms are obliged to do. That the chain, escocheon,\r\nrod, and crown, shall be of the like materials, value, and weight, with\r\nthose borne and used by Garter Principal King of Arms, and of the like\r\nfashion, the before specified variations only excepted: and that besides\r\nthe duties required of him in the several other articles of the statutes,\r\nhe shall diligently perform whatever the Sovereign or Great Master shall\r\nfurther command. On the 14th January 1725, His Majesty was further pleased\r\nby his Royal sign-manual, to erect, make, constitute, and ordain the then\r\nBath King of Arms, _Gloucester_ King of Arms, and principal Herald of the\r\nparts of Wales, and to direct letters patent to be made out and pass the\r\nGreat Seal, empowering him to grant arms and crests to persons residing\r\nwithin the dominions of Wales, either jointly with Garter, or singly by\r\nhimself, with the consent and at the pleasure of the Earl Marshal, or his\r\ndeputy for the time being, and for {36} the future that the office of\r\nGloucester should be inseparably annexed, united, and perpetually\r\nconsolidated with the office of _Bath King of Arms, of the Most Honourable\r\nMilitary Order of the Bath, and Gloucester King of Arms, and principal\r\nHerald of the parts of Wales_. And also that he, for the dignity of the\r\norder, should in all assemblies and at all times have and take place and\r\nprecedency above and before all other provincial Kings of Arms whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nThis armorial jurisdiction, however, was subsequently, as has been\r\npreviously explained, annulled.\r\n\r\nConcerning the heralds Berry remarks: \"In former ages, when honour and\r\nchivalry were at their height, these officers were held in great\r\nestimation, as appears by the ceremonies which attended their creations,\r\nwhich was by the Sovereign himself or by special commission from him, and,\r\naccording to Gerard Leigh, was after the following manner: The King asked\r\nthe person to be so created whether he were a gentleman of blood or of\r\nsecond coat-armour; if he was not, the King gave him lands and fees, and\r\nassigned him and his heirs proper arms. Then, as the messenger was brought\r\nin by the herald of the province, so the pursuivant was brought in by the\r\neldest herald, who, at the prince's command, performed all the ceremonies,\r\nas turning the coat of arms, setting the manacles thereof on the arms of\r\nthe pursuivant, and putting about his neck the collar of SS, and when he\r\nwas named, the prince himself took the cup from the herald, which was gilt,\r\nand poured the water and wine upon the head of the pursuivant, creating him\r\nby the name of _our herald_, and the King, when the oath was administered,\r\ngave the same cup to the new herald.\r\n\r\n_Upton_ sums up the business of a herald thus: That it was their office to\r\ncreate under officers, to number the people, to commence treaties of\r\nmatrimony and of peace between princes, to visit kingdoms and regions, and\r\nto be present at martial exploits, &c., and they were to wear a coat of\r\ntheir master's arms, wearing the same in conflicts and tournaments, in\r\nriding through foreign countries, and at all great entertainments,\r\ncoronations of kings and queens, and the solemnities of princes, dukes, and\r\nother great lords.\r\n\r\nIn the time of King Richard II. there belonged to the King of Arms and\r\nheralds the following fees, viz.: at the coronation of the King, a bounty\r\nof £100; when the King first displayed his banners, 100 marks; when the\r\nKing's son was made a knight, 40 marks; when the prince and a duke first\r\ndisplay their banners, £20; if it be a marquis, 20 marks; if an earl, £10;\r\nif a baron, 5 marks of silver crowns, of 15 nobles; and if a knight\r\nbachelor, newly made a banneret, 3 marks, or 10 nobles; when the King is\r\nmarried, the said Kings of Arms and heralds to have £50; when the Queen has\r\na child {37} christened, a largess at the Queen's pleasure, or of the lords\r\nof the council, which was sometimes £100, and at others 100 marks, more or\r\nless; and when she is churched, such another largess; when princesses,\r\nduchesses, marchionesses, countesses, and baronesses have a child\r\nchristened, and when they are churched, a largess suitable to their quality\r\nand pleasure; as often as the King wears his crown, or holds Royal state,\r\nespecially at the four great festivals of Christmas, Easter, Whitsuntide,\r\nand All Saints, to every one of the three Kings of Arms present when the\r\nKing goes to the chapel to mass, a largess at the King's pleasure; when a\r\nmaiden princess, or daughter of a duke, marquis, earl, or baron is married,\r\nthere belongs to the said Kings of Arms, if present, the upper garment she\r\nis married in; if there be a combat within lists, there belong to the Kings\r\nof Arms, if present, and if not to the other heralds present, their\r\npavilions; and if one of the combatants is vanquished, the Kings of Arms\r\nand heralds who are present shall have all the accoutrements of the person\r\nso vanquished, and all other armour that falls to the ground; when subjects\r\nrebel, and fortify any camp or place, and afterwards quit the same, and\r\nfly, without a battle, there appertain to the said Kings of Arms and\r\nheralds who are present all the carts, carriages, and tools left behind;\r\nand, at New Year's Tide, all the noblemen and knights of the court used to\r\ngive the heralds New Year's gifts. Besides the King's heralds, in former\r\ntimes, divers noblemen had heralds and pursuivants, who went with their\r\nlords, with the King's heralds, when attending the King.\r\n\r\nThe fees of the King's heralds and pursuivants of arms have since varied,\r\nand, besides fees upon creations of peers, baronets, and knights, they have\r\nstill donations for attendance at court upon the festivals of Christmas,\r\nEaster, Whitsuntide, All Saints, and St. George's Day; fees upon\r\ninstallation of Knights of the Garter and Bath, Royal marriages, funerals,\r\npublic solemnities, &c., with small salaries paid from the Exchequer; but\r\ntheir ancient fees from the nobility, upon certain occasions, have been\r\nlong discontinued, and their principal emolument arises from grants of\r\narms, the tracing of genealogies, and recording the same in the Registers\r\nof the College of Arms.\"\r\n\r\nThe present _heralds_ are six in number, viz.:--\r\n\r\n_Windsor Herald_, which title was instituted 38th of Edward III., when that\r\nmonarch was in France.\r\n\r\n_Chester Herald_, instituted in the same reign.\r\n\r\n_Richmond Herald_, instituted by King Edward IV.\r\n\r\n_Somerset Herald_, instituted by King Henry VIII. about the time when that\r\nmonarch created his son Henry Fitzroy Duke of Somerset.\r\n\r\n_York Herald_, instituted by King Edward III. in honour of his son, whom he\r\ncreated Duke of York. {38}\r\n\r\n_Lancaster Herald_, also instituted by Edward III. when he created his son\r\nDuke of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nThe heralds were first incorporated as a college by Richard III. They were\r\nstyled the Corporation of Kings, Heralds, and Pursuivants of Arms.\r\n\r\nConcerning Pursuivants of Arms, Berry remarks that these officers, who are\r\nthe lowest in degree amongst officers of arms, \"were, as the name implies,\r\nfollowers, marshals, or messengers attendant upon the heralds. Pursuivants\r\nwere formerly created by the nobility (who had, likewise, heralds of arms)\r\nwith great ceremony in the following manner. One of the heralds, wearing\r\nhis master's coat, leading the person to be created pursuivant by the left\r\nhand, and holding a cup full of wine and water in his right, came into the\r\npresence of the lord and master of him who was to be created, and of whom\r\nthe herald asked by what name he would have his pursuivant called, which\r\nthe lord having mentioned, the herald then poured part of the wine and\r\nwater upon his head, calling him by the name so assigned to him. The herald\r\nthen took the coat of his lord, and put it over his head athwart, so that\r\npart of the coat made for the arms before and behind, and the longer part\r\nof it on both sides of the arms of the person created, and in which way the\r\npursuivant was always to wear it. This done, an oath of fidelity was\r\nadministered to the new-made pursuivant, and the ceremony concluded.\"\r\n\r\nThis curious method of the wearing of the tabard by a pursuivant has long\r\nsince been discontinued, if indeed it was ever generally adopted, a point\r\non which I have by no means been able to satisfy myself.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of heralds and pursuivants of arms by the nobility has long\r\nbeen discontinued, and there are now only four pursuivants belonging to the\r\nCollege of Arms, viz.:--\r\n\r\n_Rouge-Croix_, the first in point of antiquity of creation, is so styled\r\nfrom the red cross of St. George, the Patron Saint of England.\r\n\r\n_Blue-Mantle_, so called by King Edward III., in honour of the French coat\r\nwhich he assumed, being blue.\r\n\r\n_Rouge-Dragon_, so styled from the red dragon, one of the supporters of the\r\nRoyal arms of King Henry VII. (who created this pursuivant), and also the\r\nbadge of Wales, and\r\n\r\n_Portcullis_, also instituted by Henry VII., and so named from that badge,\r\nor cognisance, used by him.\r\n\r\nThe duties of a pursuivant are similar to those of a herald; he assists in\r\nall public processions, or ceremonies, such as Royal marriages, funerals,\r\ninstallations, &c., and has certain fees for attendance upon such\r\noccasions. Pursuivants likewise receive fees upon creations of peers,\r\nbaronets, and knights, and also donations for attending court upon the\r\nprincipal festivals of Christmas, Easter, Whit-Sunday, All {39} Saints, and\r\nSt. George's Day, and a small salary payable out of the Exchequer. They\r\nwear a tabard of damask silk, embroidered with the Royal arms, like the\r\nheralds, but no collar of SS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Officers of Arms as represented in the famous\r\nTournament Roll of Henry VIII., now preserved in the College of Arms.]\r\n\r\nOf the Heraldic Executive in Scotland, Lyon King of Arms (Sir James Balfour\r\nPaul), in his book \"Heraldry in relation to Scottish History and Art,\"\r\nwrites: \"At one period the Lyon was solemnly crowned at his inauguration,\r\nand vested with his tabard and baton of office.\" The ceremony was a very\r\nelaborate one, and is fully described by Sir James Balfour in a MS., now in\r\nthe Advocates' Library. There is also an account of the coronation of Sir\r\nAlexander Durham, when Laurie, the minister of the Tron Kirk, preached from\r\nthe text, \"What shall be done to the man whom the king delighteth to\r\nhonour?\" The crown was of gold, and exactly similar to the Imperial crown\r\nof Scotland, save that it had no jewels. Now the Lyon's crown is the same\r\nas the English King of Arms. The crown is only worn at Royal coronations.\r\nAt that of Charles I. at Edinburgh in 1633, the Lyon carried the vessel\r\ncontaining the sacred oil. In addition to his strictly armorial\r\nappointment, the Lyon is also a King of Arms of the Most Ancient and Most\r\nNoble Order of the Thistle.\r\n\r\nHeralds and pursuivants formed an important part from very early times not\r\nonly of the Royal Household, but also of those of the higher nobility, many\r\nof whom had private heralds. Of these officers there is a very full list\r\ngiven by Dr. Dickson in the preface to the Lord Treasurer's Accounts. Of\r\nheralds who were or ultimately became part of the King's Household we meet\r\nwith Rothesay, Marchmont, Snowdon, Albany, Ross, and Islay; Ireland,\r\nOrkney, and Carrick are also mentioned as heralds, but it is doubtful\r\nwhether the first and last were ever more than pursuivants. Of the latter\r\nclass of officers the following were in the Royal establishment: Carrick,\r\nBute, Dingwall, Kintyre, Ormonde, Unicorn; but we also find Aliszai or\r\nAlishay, Dragance, Diligens, Montrose, Falkland, Ireland, Darnaway,\r\nGarioch, Ettrick, Hales, Lindsay, Endure, Douglas, and Angus. Of the latter\r\nGarioch was created by James IV. for his brother John, Earl of Mar; Hailes\r\nin 1488, when Lord Hailes was made Earl of Bothwell; while Lindsay and\r\nEndure were both evidently attached to the Lindsay family, as were Douglas\r\nand Angus to the noblemen whose titles they bore. In 1403 Henry IV. of\r\nEngland granted a pursuivant under the title of Shrewsbury to George, Earl\r\nof March, for services rendered at the battle of that name, but we do not\r\nfind that the office was continued.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland heralds appear at an early date, though none are mentioned as\r\nattending the coronation of Alexander III. in 1249; nor is there any\r\naccount of any such officers accompanying that sovereign when he did homage\r\nto Edward I. at Westminster in 1278. In the next {40} century, however,\r\narmorial bearings were quite well known in Scotland, and there is an entry\r\nin the Exchequer Rolls on 10th October 1337 of a payment of £32, 6s. Scots\r\nfor the making of seventeen armorial banners, and in 1364 there is another\r\nto the heralds for services at the tournaments; while William Petilloch,\r\nherald, has a grant from David II. of three husbandlands in Bonjedward, and\r\nAllan Fawside gets a gift of the forfeited estate of one Coupland, a herald\r\n(_temp._ Edward Baliol).[2] The first mention of a herald, under his\r\nofficial designation, which I have met with in our records occurs in 1365,\r\nwhen there is a confirmation under the Great Seal by David II. of a charter\r\nby Dugal McDowille to John Trupour or Trumpour \"_nunc dicto Carric\r\nheraldo_.\" Sir James Balfour tells us that the Lyon and his heralds\r\nattended the coronation of Robert II. at Holyrood on 23rd May 1371, but\r\nwhether or not this is true--and I have not been able to verify it--it is\r\ncertain that a Lyon Herald existed very shortly after that date, as in the\r\nExchequer Rolls mention is made of the payment of a certain sum to such an\r\nofficer in 1377; in 1379 Froissart says that a herald was sent by Robert\r\nII. to London to explain that the truce had been infringed without his will\r\nand against his knowledge, and on 8th April 1381 a warrant was issued in\r\nLondon for a licence to \"Lion Heraud\" of the King of Scots, authorising him\r\nto take away a complete suit of armour which he had bought in that city. It\r\nis not, however, till 1388 that we find Lyon accorded the Royal style. In\r\nthat year a payment is made \"_Leoni regi heraldorum_,\" but at the audit\r\nfollowing the battle of Otterburn he is called _defunctus_, which suggests\r\nthat he had been slain on that well-fought field. The Lyon appears in\r\nseveral embassies about this period both to England and France, and one\r\nHenry Greve, designed in the English Issue Rolls as \"King of Scottish\r\nHeralds,\" was at the Tower of London in 1399, either at or immediately\r\nafter the coronation of Henry IV. From 1391 onwards there is frequent\r\nmention of one Douglas, \"Herald of the King,\" and in 1421 he is styled\r\n\"Lyon Herald.\"\r\n\r\nOf the German officers of arms they, like the English, are divided into\r\nthree classes, known as _Wappenkönige_, _Herolde_, and _Persevanten_.\r\nThese, like our own officers, had peculiar titles; for example _Suchenwirt_\r\n(an Austrian ducal herald), _Lub-den Frumen_ (a Lichtenstein pursuivant),\r\n_Jerusalem_ (a herald of the Limmer Palatinate), _Romreich_ (an Imperial\r\nherald). About the middle of the sixteenth century, the official names of\r\nthe heralds fell into disuse; they began to make use of their ancestral\r\nnames with the title of _Edel_ and _Ehrenvest_ (noble and honourable), but\r\nthis did not last long, and the heralds found themselves thrown back {41}\r\ninto the old ways, into which the knightly accoutrements had already\r\nwandered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--The velvet tabard of Sir William Dugdale, Garter\r\nKing of Arms from 26th April 1677 to 10th February 1686.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--William Bruges, the first Garter King of Arms,\r\nappointed 5th January 1420. (From an illuminated MS. in the Museum at\r\nOxford.)]\r\n\r\nThe official dress of an officer of arms as such in Great Britain is merely\r\nhis tabard (Figs. 13, 14, 15). This garment in style and shape has remained\r\nunchanged in this country from the earliest known period of which\r\nrepresentations of officers of arms exist; but whilst the tabard itself has\r\nremained unaltered in its style, the arms thereupon have constantly\r\nchanged, these always being the arms of the Sovereign for the time being.\r\nThe costume worn with the tabard has naturally been subject to many\r\nchanges, but it is doubtful if any attempt to regulate such costume was\r\never officially made prior to the reign of Queen Victoria. The tabard of a\r\npursuivant is of damask silk; that of a herald, of satin; and that of a\r\nking of arms, of velvet.\r\n\r\nThe initial letter on page 1 is a portrait of John Smert, Garter King of\r\nArms, and is taken from the grant of arms to the Tallow Chandlers' Company,\r\ndated 24th September 1456. He is there represented as wearing beneath his\r\ntabard black breeches and coat, and a golden crown. But Fig. 15 is actually\r\na representation of the first Garter King of Arms, William Bruges,\r\nappointed 5th January 1420. He is represented as carrying a white staff, a\r\npractice which has been recently revived, white wands being carried by all\r\nthe heralds at the public funeral of the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone. In\r\nGermany the wands of the heralds were later painted with the colours of the\r\nescutcheons of the Sovereign to whom they were attached. There was until\r\nrecently no official hat for an officer of arms in England, and\r\nconfirmation of this is to be found in the fact that Dallaway mentions a\r\nspecial licence to Wriothesley Garter giving him permission to wear a cap\r\non account of his great age. Obviously, however, a tabard requires other\r\nclothing to be worn with it. The heralds in Scotland, until quite recently,\r\nwhen making public proclamations were content to appear in the ordinary\r\nelastic-side boots and cloth trousers of everyday life. This gave way for a\r\nbrief period, in which Court dress was worn below the tabard, but now, as\r\nin England, the recognised uniform of a member of the Royal Household is\r\nworn. In England, owing to the less frequent ceremonial appearances of the\r\nheralds, and the more scrupulous control {42} which has been exercised, no\r\nsuch anachronisms as were perpetuated in Scotland have been tolerated, and\r\nit has been customary for the officers of arms to wear their uniform as\r\nmembers of the Sovereign's Household (in which uniform they attend the\r\nlevees) beneath the tabard when making proclamations at the opening of\r\nParliament or on similar occasions. At a coronation and at some other full\r\nState ceremonies they wear knee-breeches. At the late ceremony of the\r\ncoronation of King Edward VII., a head-dress was designed for the officers\r\nof arms. These caps are of black velvet embroidered at the {43} side with a\r\nrose, a thistle, or a harp, respectively for the English, Scottish, and\r\nIrish officers of arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--A Herald. (_Temp._ Hen. VIII.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--A State Trumpeter. (_Temp._ Hen. VIII.)]\r\n\r\nA great deal of confusion has arisen between the costume and the functions\r\nof a Herald and a Trumpeter, though the confusion has been confined to the\r\nminds of the uninitiated and the theatrical stage. The whole subject was\r\nvery amusingly dealt with in the _Genealogical Magazine_ in an article by\r\nMr. G. Ambrose Lee, Bluemantle, and the illustrations which he gives of the\r\nrelative dresses of the Heralds and the Trumpeters at different periods\r\n(see Figs. 16-19) are interesting. Briefly, the matter can be summed up in\r\nthe statement that there never was a Trumpeter who made a proclamation, or\r\nwore a tabard, and there never was a Herald who blew a trumpet. The\r\nTrumpeters nearly {44} always accompanied the Heralds to proclaim their\r\npresence and call attention to their proclamation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--A State Trumpeter and a Herald at the coronation\r\nof James I.]\r\n\r\nIn France the Heralds were formed into an incorporation by Charles VI. in\r\n1406, their head being Mountjoye, King of Arms, with ten heralds and\r\npursuivants under him. It will be noticed that this incorporation is\r\nearlier than that of the College of Arms in England. The Revolution played\r\nhavoc with the French Records, and no College of Arms now exists in France.\r\nBut it is doubtful whether at any time it reached the dignity or authority\r\nwhich its English counterpart has enjoyed in former times.\r\n\r\nFig. 20 represents a French Herald of the early part of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. It is taken from a representation of the Rally of the Parisians\r\nagainst King Charles VI. in 1413, to be found in a MS. edition of\r\nFroissart, formerly in the Royal Library at Paris.\r\n\r\nAll the heralds and Kings of Arms (but not the pursuivants) wear the\r\ncurious collar of SS about which there has been so much discussion. {45}\r\nThe form has remained unchanged, save that the badge is the badge for the\r\ntime being of the Sovereign. The heralds have their collars of SS of\r\nsilver, whilst those of a King of Arms are of silver gilt, and the latter\r\nhave the further distinction that a portcullis is introduced on each\r\nshoulder. The heralds and Kings of Arms usually place these collars round\r\ntheir shields in representations of their arms. Collars of SS are also worn\r\nby Serjeants-at-Arms, and by the Lord Chief Justice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Peace proclaimed at the Royal Exchange after the\r\nCrimean War.]\r\n\r\nThe English Heralds have no equivalent badge to that which the Scottish\r\nHeralds wear suspended from their necks by a ribbon. In Ireland both\r\nHeralds and Pursuivants wear a badge.\r\n\r\nIn addition each King of Arms has his crown; the only occasion, however,\r\nupon which this is worn being at the ceremony of a coronation. The crown is\r\nof silver gilt, formed of a circle upon which is inscribed part of the\r\nfirst verse of the 51st Psalm, viz. \"Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam\r\nmisericordiam tuam\": the rim is surmounted of sixteen leaves, in shape\r\nresembling the oak-leaf, every alternate one being somewhat higher than the\r\nremainder. Nine of these leaves are shown in a representation of it. The\r\ncap is of crimson satin, closed at the top by a gold tassel, and turned up\r\nwith ermine.\r\n\r\nGarter King of Arms has a baton or \"sceptre\" of silver gilt, about two feet\r\nin length, the top being of gold, of four sides of equal height, {46} but\r\nof unequal breadth. On the two larger sides are the arms of St. George\r\nimpaling the Sovereign's, and on the two lesser sides the arms of St.\r\nGeorge surrounded by the Garter and motto, the whole ensigned with an\r\nImperial crown. This \"sceptre\" has sometimes been placed in bend behind the\r\narms of Garter King. Lyon King of Arms has a baton of blue enamel with gold\r\nextremities, the baton being powdered with roses, thistles, and\r\nfleurs-de-lis. Lyon (Sir James Balfour Paul) in his \"Heraldry in relation\r\nto Scottish History and Art,\" remarks that this is one of the few pieces of\r\nBritish official regalia which is still adorned with the ancient ensigns of\r\nFrance. But knowing how strictly all official regalia in England is\r\nrequired to have the armorial devices thereupon changed, as the Royal arms\r\nand badges change, there can be very little doubt that the appearance of\r\nthe fleur-de-lis in this case is due to an oversight. The baton happens to\r\nbe that of a former Lyon King of Arms, which really should long since have\r\nbeen discarded and a new one substituted. Two batons are usually placed in\r\nsaltire behind the arms of Lyon King of Arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--A French Herald of the early part of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.]\r\n\r\nUlster King of Arms has a staff of office which, however, really belongs to\r\nhis office as Knight Attendant on the Most Illustrious Order of St.\r\nPatrick.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish Heralds each have a rod of ebony tipped with ivory, {47} which\r\nhas been sometimes stated to be a rod of office. This, however, is not the\r\ncase, and the explanation of their possession of it is very simple. They\r\nare constantly called upon by virtue of their office to make from the\r\nMarket Cross in Edinburgh the Royal Proclamations. Now these Proclamations\r\nare read from printed copies which in size of type and paper are always of\r\nthe nature of a poster. The Herald would naturally find some difficulty in\r\nholding up a large piece of paper of this size on a windy day, in such a\r\nmanner that it was easy to read from; consequently he winds it round his\r\nebony staff, slowly unwinding it all the time as he reads.\r\n\r\nGarter King of Arms, Lyon King of Arms, and Ulster King of Arms all possess\r\nbadges of their offices which they wear about their necks.\r\n\r\nThe badge of Garter is of gold, having on both sides the arms of St.\r\nGeorge, impaled with those of the Sovereign, within the Garter and motto,\r\nenamelled in their proper colours, and ensigned with the Royal crown.\r\n\r\nThe badge of Lyon King of Arms is oval, and is worn suspended by a broad\r\ngreen ribbon. The badge proper consists on the obverse of the effigy of St.\r\nAndrew bearing his cross before him, with a thistle beneath, all enamelled\r\nin the proper colours on an azure ground. The reverse contains the arms of\r\nScotland, having in the lower parts of the badge a thistle, as on the other\r\nside; the whole surmounted with the Imperial crown.\r\n\r\nThe badge of \"Ulster\" is of gold, containing on one side the cross of St.\r\nPatrick, or, as it is described in the statutes, \"The cross gules of the\r\nOrder upon a field argent, impaled with the arms of the Realm of Ireland,\"\r\nand both encircled with the motto, \"Quis Separabit,\" and the date of the\r\ninstitution of the Order, MDCCLXXXIII. The reverse exhibits the arms of the\r\noffice of Ulster, viz.: \"Or, a cross gules, on a chief of the last a lion\r\nof England between a harp and portcullis, all of the first,\" placed on a\r\nground of green enamel, surrounded by a gold border with shamrocks,\r\nsurmounted by an Imperial crown, and suspended by a sky-blue riband from\r\nthe neck.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Corporation of the College of Arms are: Argent, a cross\r\ngules between four doves, the dexter wing of each expanded and inverted\r\nazure. Crest: on a ducal coronet or, a dove rising azure. Supporters: two\r\nlions rampant guardant argent, ducally gorged or.\r\n\r\nThe official arms of the English Kings of Arms are:--\r\n\r\n_Garter King of Arms._--Argent, a cross gules, on a chief azure, a ducal\r\ncoronet encircled with a garter, between a lion passant guardant on the\r\ndexter and a fleur-de-lis on the sinister all or.\r\n\r\n_Clarenceux King of Arms._--Argent, a cross gules, on a chief of the second\r\na lion passant guardant or, crowned of the last. {48}\r\n\r\n_Norroy King of Arms._--Argent, a cross gules, on a chief of the second a\r\nlion passant guardant crowned of the first, between a fleur-de-lis on the\r\ndexter and a key on the sinister of the last.\r\n\r\nBadges have never been officially assigned to the various Heralds by any\r\nspecific instruments of grant or record; but from a remote period certain\r\nof the Royal badges relating to their titles have been used by various\r\nHeralds, viz.:--\r\n\r\n_Lancaster._--The red rose of Lancaster ensigned by the Royal crown.\r\n\r\n_York._--The white rose of York en soleil ensigned by the Royal crown.\r\n\r\n_Richmond._--The red rose of Lancaster impaled with the white rose en\r\nsoleil of York, the whole ensigned with the Royal crown.\r\n\r\n_Windsor._--Rays of the sun issuing from clouds.\r\n\r\nThe four Pursuivants make use of the badges from which they derive their\r\ntitles.\r\n\r\nThe official arms of Lyon King of Arms and of Lyon Office are the same,\r\nnamely: Argent, a lion sejant full-faced gules, holding in the dexter paw a\r\nthistle slipped vert and in the sinister a shield of the second; on a chief\r\nazure, a St. Andrew's cross of the field.\r\n\r\nThere are no official arms for Ulster's Office, that office, unlike the\r\nCollege of Arms, not being a corporate body, but the official arms of\r\nUlster King of Arms are: Or, a cross gules, on a chief of the last a lion\r\npassant guardant between a harp and a portcullis all of the field. {49}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHERALDIC BRASSES\r\n\r\nBY REV. WALTER J. KAYE, JUNR., B.A., F.S.A., F.S.A. SCOT.\r\n\r\n_Member of the Monumental Brass Society, London; Honorary Member of the\r\nSpalding Gentlemen's Society; Author of \"A Brief History of Gosberton, in\r\nthe County of Lincoln.\"_\r\n\r\nMonumental brasses do not merely afford a guide to the capricious changes\r\nof fashion in armour, in ecclesiastical vestments (which have altered but\r\nlittle), and in legal, civilian, and feminine costume, but they provide us\r\nalso with a vast number of admirable specimens of heraldic art. The vandal\r\nand the fanatic have robbed us of many of these beautiful memorials, but of\r\nthose which survive to our own day the earliest on the continent of Europe\r\nmarks the last resting-place of Abbot Ysowilpe, 1231, at Verden, in\r\nHanover. In England there was once a brass, which unfortunately disappeared\r\nlong ago, to an Earl of Bedford, in St. Paul's Church, Bedford, of the year\r\n1208, leaving 1277 as the date of the earliest one.\r\n\r\nLatten (Fr. _laiton_), the material of which brasses were made, was at an\r\nearly date manufactured in large quantities at Cologne, whence plates of\r\nthis metal came to be known as cullen (Köln) plates; these were largely\r\nexported to other countries, and the Flemish workmen soon attained the\r\ngreatest proficiency in their engraving. Flemish brasses are usually large\r\nand rectangular, having the space between the figure and the marginal\r\ninscription filled either by diaper work or by small figures in niches.\r\nBrasses vary considerably in size: the matrix of Bishop Beaumont's brass in\r\nDurham Cathedral measures about 16 feet by 8 feet, and the memorial to\r\nGriel van Ruwescuere, in the chapel of the Lady Superior of the Béguinage\r\nat Bruges, is only about 1 foot square. Brazen effigies are more numerous\r\nin England in the eastern and southern counties, than in parts more remote\r\nfrom the continent of Europe.\r\n\r\nArmorial bearings are displayed in a great variety of ways on monumental\r\nbrasses, some of which are exhibited in the rubbings selected for\r\nillustration. In most cases separate shields are placed above and below the\r\nfigures. They occur also in the spandrils of canopies and {50} in the\r\nshafts and finials of the same, as well as in the centre and at the angles\r\nof border-fillets. They naturally predominate in the memorials of warriors,\r\nwhere we find them emblazoned not only on shield and pennon but on the\r\nscabbard and ailettes, and on the jupon, tabard, and cuirass also, while\r\ncrests frequently occur on the tilting-helm. In one case (the brass of Sir\r\nPeter Legh, 1527, at Winwick, co. Lancaster) they figure upon the priestly\r\nchasuble. Walter Pescod, the merchant of Boston, Lincolnshire, 1398, wears\r\na gown adorned with peascods--a play upon his name; and many a merchant's\r\nbrass bears his coat of arms and merchant's mark beside, pointing a moral\r\nto not a few at the present day. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\r\nwitnessed the greatest profusion in heraldic decoration in brasses, when\r\nthe tabard and the heraldic mantle were evolved. A good example of the\r\nformer remains in the parish church of Ormskirk, Lancashire, in the brass\r\ncommemorating a member of the Scarisbrick family, _c._ 1500 (Fig. 21).\r\nLadies were accustomed at this time to wear their husband's arms upon the\r\nmantle or outer garment and their own upon the kirtle, but the fashion\r\nwhich obtained at a subsequent period was to emblazon the husband's arms on\r\nthe dexter and their own on the sinister side of the mantle (Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Brass in the Scarisbrick Chapel of Ormskirk\r\nChurch, co. Lancs., to a member of the Scarisbrick family of that name.\r\nArms: Gules, three mullets in bend between two bendlets engrailed argent.\r\n(From a rubbing by Walter J. Kaye.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Brass of Margaret (daughter of Henry Percy, Earl\r\nof Northumberland), second wife of Henry, 1st Earl of Cumberland, in\r\nSkipton Parish Church. Arms: On the dexter side those of the Earl of\r\nCumberland, on the sinister side those of Percy.]\r\n\r\nThe majority of such monuments, as we behold them now, are destitute of any\r\nindications of metals or tinctures, largely owing to the action of the\r\nvarying degrees of temperature in causing contraction and expansion. Here\r\nand there, however, we may still detect traces of their pristine glory. But\r\nthese matters received due attention from the engraver. To represent _or_,\r\nhe left the surface of the brass untouched, except for gilding or perhaps\r\npolishing; this universal method has solved many heraldic problems. Lead or\r\nsome other white metal was inlaid to indicate _argent_, and the various\r\ntinctures were supplied by the excision of a portion of the plate, thereby\r\nforming a depression, which was filled up by pouring in some resinous\r\nsubstance of the requisite colour. The various kinds of fur used in armory\r\nmay be readily distinguished, with the sole exception of _vair_ (_argent_\r\nand _azure_), which presents the appearance of a row of small upright\r\nshields alternating with a similar row reversed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Brass of Sir John D'Aubernoun at Stoke D'Abernon.\r\nArms: Azure, a chevron or. (From a rubbing by Walter J. Kaye.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Brass of Sir Roger de Trumpington at Trumpington.\r\nArms: Azure, crusilly and two trumpets palewise or. (From a rubbing by\r\nWalter J. Kaye.)]\r\n\r\nThe earliest brass extant in England is that to Sir John D'Aubernoun, the\r\nelder (Fig. 23), at Stoke D'Abernon, in Surrey, which carries us back to\r\nthe year 1277. The simple marginal inscription in Norman-French,\r\nsurrounding the figure, and each Lombardic capital of which is set in its\r\nown matrix, reads: \"Sire: John: Daubernoun: Chivaler: Gist: Icy: Deu: De:\r\nSa: Alme: Eyt: Mercy:\"[3] In the space {51} between the inscription and the\r\nupper portion of the figure were two small shields, of which the dexter one\r\nalone remains, charged with the arms of the knight: \"Azure, a chevron, or.\"\r\nSir John D'Aubernoun is represented in a complete panoply of chain\r\nmail--his head being protected by a _coif de mailles_, which is joined to\r\nthe _hauberk_ or mail {52} shirt, which extends to the hands, having\r\napparently no divisions for the fingers, and being tightened by straps at\r\nthe wrists. The legs, which are not crossed, are covered by long\r\n_chausses_, or stockings of mail, {53} protected at the knees by _poleyns_\r\nor _genouillères_ of _cuir bouilli_ richly ornamented by elaborate designs.\r\nA surcoat, probably of linen, depends from the shoulders to a little below\r\nthe knees, and is cut away to a point above {54} the knee. This garment is\r\ntightly confined (as the creases in the surcoat show) at the waist by a\r\ngirdle, and over it is passed a _guige_ whereto the long sword is attached.\r\n\"Pryck\" spurs are fixed to the instep, and the feet rest upon a lion, whose\r\nmouth grasps the lower portion of a lance. The lance bears a pennon charged\r\nwith a chevron, as also is the small heater-shaped shield borne on the\r\nknight's left arm. The whole composition measures about eight feet by\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nHeraldry figures more prominently in our second illustration, the brass to\r\nSir Roger de Trumpington, 1289 (Fig. 24). This fine effigy lies under the\r\ncanopy of an altar-tomb, so called, in the Church of St. Michael and All\r\nAngels, Trumpington, Cambridgeshire. It portrays the knight in armour\r\nclosely resembling that already described, with these exceptions: the head\r\nrests upon a huge _heaume_, or tilting-helm, attached by a chain to the\r\ngirdle, and the neck is here protected from side-thrusts by _ailettes_ or\r\noblong plates fastened behind the shoulders, and bearing the arms of Sir\r\nRoger. A dog here replaces the lion at the feet, the lance and pennon are\r\nabsent, and the shield is rounded to the body. On this brass the arms not\r\nonly occur upon the shield, but also upon the ailettes, and are four times\r\nrepeated on the scabbard. They afford a good example of \"canting\" arms:\r\n\"Azure, crusilly and two trumpets palewise or, with a label of five points\r\nin chief, for difference.\" It is interesting also to notice that the\r\nengraver had not {55} completed his task, for the short horizontal lines\r\nacross the dexter side of the shield indicate his intention of cutting away\r\nthe surface of the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Brass of Sir Robert de Septvans in Chartham\r\nChurch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Brass of Sir William de Aldeburgh at Aldborough,\r\nYorks. Arms: Azure, a fesse argent between three cross crosslets or. (From\r\na rubbing by Walter J. Kaye.)]\r\n\r\nSir Robert de Setvans (formerly Septvans), whose beautiful brass may be\r\nseen at Chartham, Kent, is habited in a surcoat whereon, together with the\r\nshield and ailettes, are seven winnowing fans--another instance of canting\r\narms (Fig. 25). This one belongs to a somewhat later date, 1307.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Brass of Elizabeth Knevet.]\r\n\r\nOur next example is a mural effigy to Sir William de Aldeburgh, _c._ 1360,\r\nfrom the north aisle of Aldborough Church, near Boroughbridge, Yorkshire\r\n(Fig. 26). He is attired like the \"veray parfite gentil knight\" of Chaucer,\r\nin a _bascinet_ or steel cap, to which is laced the _camail_ or tippet of\r\nchain mail, and a hauberk almost concealed by a _jupon_, whereon are\r\nemblazoned his arms: \"Azure, a fess indented argent, between three\r\ncrosslets botony, or.\" The first crosslet is charged with an annulet,\r\nprobably as a mark of cadency. The engraver has omitted the indenture upon\r\nthe fess, which, however, appears upon the shield. The knight's arms are\r\nprotected by _epaulières_, _brassarts_, _coutes_, and _vambraces_; his\r\nhands, holding a heart, by gauntlets of steel. An elaborate baldric passes\r\nround his waist, from which are suspended, on the left, a cross-hilted\r\nsword, in a slightly ornamented scabbard; on the right, a _misericorde_, or\r\ndagger of mercy. The thighs are covered by cuisses--steel plates, here\r\ndeftly concealed probably by satin or velvet secured by metal studs--the\r\nknees by _genouillères_, the lower leg by _jambes_, which reveal chausses\r\nof mail at the interstices. Sollerets, or long, pointed shoes, whereto are\r\nattached rowel spurs, complete his outfit. The figure stands upon a bracket\r\nbearing the name \"Will's de Aldeburgh.\"\r\n\r\nThe parish church of Eastington, Gloucestershire, contains a brass to\r\nElizabeth Knevet, which is illustrated and described by Mr. Cecil T. Davis\r\nat p. 117 of his excellent work on the \"Monumental Brasses of\r\nGloucestershire.\"[4] The block (Fig. 27), which presents a good example of\r\nthe heraldic mantle, has been very kindly placed at my disposal by Mr.\r\nDavis. To confine our description to the heraldic portion of the brass, we\r\nfind the following arms upon the mantle:--\r\n\r\n\"Quarterly, 1. argent, a bend sable, within a bordure engrailed azure\r\n(Knevet); 2. argent, a bend azure, and chief, gules (Cromwell); 3. chequy\r\nor and gules, a chief ermine (Tatshall); 4. chequy or and gules, a bend\r\nermine (De Cailly or Clifton); 5. paly of six within a bordure bezanté....\r\n6. bendy of six, a canton....\"[5]\r\n\r\nA coat of arms occurs also at each corner of the slab: \"Nos. 1 and 4 are on\r\nordinary shields, and 2 and 3 on lozenges. Nos. 1 and {56} 3 are charged\r\nwith the same bearings as are on her mantle. No. 2, on a lozenge,\r\nquarterly, 1. Knevet; 2. Cromwell; 3. Tatshall; 4. Cailli; 5. De Woodstock;\r\n6. paly of six within a bordure; 7. bendy of six, a canton; 8. or, a\r\nchevron gules (Stafford); 9. azure, a bend cottised between six lioncels\r\nrampant, or (de Bohun). No. 4 similar to No. 1, with the omission of 2 and\r\n3.\"\r\n\r\nIn later times thinner plates of metal were employed, a fact which largely\r\ncontributed to preclude much of the boldness in execution hitherto\r\ndisplayed. A prodigality in shading, either by means of parallel lines or\r\nby cross-hatching, also tended to mar the beauty of later work of this\r\nkind. Nevertheless there are some good brasses of the Stuart period. These\r\nsometimes consist of a single quadrangular plate, with the upper portion\r\noccupied by armorial bearings and emblematical figures, the centre by an\r\ninscription, and the lower portion by a representation of the deceased, as\r\nat Forcett, in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Frequently, however, as at\r\nRotherham and Rawmarsh, in the West Riding of the same county, the\r\ninscription is surmounted by a view of the whole family, the father\r\nkneeling on a cushion at a fald-stool, with his sons in a similar attitude\r\nbehind him, and the mother likewise engaged with her daughters on the\r\nopposite side, while the armorial insignia find a place on separate shields\r\nabove. {57}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE COMPONENT PARTS OF AN ACHIEVEMENT\r\n\r\nWe now come to the science of armory and the rules governing the display of\r\nthese marks of honour. The term \"coat of arms,\" as we have seen, is derived\r\nfrom the textile garment or \"surcoat\" which was worn over the armour, and\r\nwhich bore in embroidery a duplication of the design upon the shield. There\r\ncan be very little doubt that arms themselves are older than the fact of\r\nthe surcoat or the term \"coat of arms.\" The entire heraldic or armorial\r\ndecoration which any one is entitled to bear may consist of many things. It\r\nmust as a minimum consist of a shield of arms, for whilst there are many\r\ncoats of arms in existence, and many still rightly in use at the present\r\nday, to which no crest belongs, a crest in this country cannot lawfully\r\nexist without its complementary coat of arms. For the last two certainly,\r\nand probably nearly three centuries, no original grant of personal arms has\r\never been issued without it containing the grant of a crest except in the\r\ncase of a grant to a woman, who of course cannot bear or transmit a crest;\r\nor else in the case of arms borne in right of women or descent from women,\r\nthrough whom naturally no right to a crest could have been transmitted. The\r\ngrants which I refer to as exceptions are those of quarterings and\r\nimpalements to be borne with other arms, or else exemplifications following\r\nupon the assumption of name and arms which in fact and theory are regrants\r\nof previously existing arms, in which cases the regrant is of the original\r\ncoat with or without a crest, as the case may be, and as the arms\r\ntheretofor existed. Grants of impersonal arms also need not include a\r\ncrest. As it has been impossible for the last two centuries to obtain a\r\ngrant of arms without its necessarily accompanying grant of crest, a\r\ndecided distinction attaches to the lawful possession of arms which have no\r\ncrest belonging to them, for of necessity the arms must be at least two\r\nhundred years old. Bearing this in mind, one cannot but wonder at the\r\nactions of some ancient families like those of Astley and Pole, who,\r\nlawfully possessing arms concerning which there is and can be no doubt or\r\nquestion, yet nevertheless invent and use crests which have no authority.\r\n\r\nOne instance and one only do I know where a crest has had a {58} legitimate\r\nexistence without any coat of arms. This case is that of the family of\r\nBuckworth, who at the time of the Visitations exhibited arms and crest. The\r\narms infringed upon those of another family, and no sufficient proof could\r\nbe produced to compel their admission as borne of right. The arms were\r\nrespited for further proof, while the crest was allowed, presumably\r\ntentatively, and whilst awaiting the further proof for the arms; no proof,\r\nhowever, was made. The arms and crest remained in this position until the\r\nyear 1806, when Sir Buckworth Buckworth-Herne, whose father had assumed the\r\nadditional name of Herne, obtained a Royal Licence to bear the name of\r\nSoame in addition to and after those of Buckworth-Herne, with the arms of\r\nSoame quarterly with the arms of Buckworth. It then became necessary to\r\nprove the right to these arms of Buckworth, and they were accordingly\r\nregranted with the trifling addition of an ermine spot upon the chevron;\r\nconsequently this solitary instance has now been rectified, and I cannot\r\nlearn of any other instance where these exceptional circumstances have\r\nsimilarly occurred; and there never has been a grant of a crest alone\r\nunless arms have been in existence previously.\r\n\r\nWhilst arms may exist alone, and the decoration of a shield form the only\r\narmorial ensign of a person, such need not be the case; and it will usually\r\nbe found that the armorial bearings of an ordinary commoner consist of\r\nshield, crest, and motto. To these must naturally be added the helmet and\r\nmantling, which become an essential to other than an abbreviated\r\nachievement when a crest has to be displayed. It should be remembered,\r\nhowever, that the helmet is not specifically granted, and apparently is a\r\nmatter of inherent right, so that a person would not be in the wrong in\r\nplacing a helmet and mantling above a shield even when no crest exists to\r\nsurmount the helmet. The motto is usually to be found but is not a\r\nnecessity, and there are many more coats of arms which have never been used\r\nwith a motto than shields which exist without a crest. Sometimes a\r\n_cri-de-guerre_ will be found instead of or in addition to a motto. The\r\nescutcheon may have supporters, or it may be displayed upon an eagle or a\r\nlymphad, &c., for which particular additions no other generic term has yet\r\nbeen coined save the very inclusive one of \"exterior ornaments.\" A coronet\r\nof rank may form a part of the achievement, and the shield may be encircled\r\nby the \"ribbons\" or the \"circles\" or by the Garter, of the various Orders\r\nof Knighthood, and by their collars. Below it may depend the badge of a\r\nBaronet of Nova Scotia, or of an Order of Knighthood, and added to it may\r\npossibly be what is termed a compartment, though this is a feature almost\r\nentirely peculiar to Scottish armory. There is also the crowning\r\ndistinction of a badge; and of all armorial insignia this is the most\r\ncherished, for the existing badges {59} are but few in number. The\r\nescutcheon may be placed in front of the crosiers of a bishop, the batons\r\nof the Earl Marshal, or similar ornaments. It may be displayed upon a\r\nmantle of estate, or it may be borne beneath a pavilion. With two more\r\nadditions the list is complete, and these are the banner and the standard.\r\nFor these several features of armory reference must be made to the various\r\nchapters in which they are treated.\r\n\r\nSuffice it here to remark that whilst the term \"coat of arms\" has through\r\nthe slipshod habits of English philology come to be used to signify a\r\nrepresentation of any heraldic bearing, the correct term for the whole\r\nemblazonment is an \"achievement,\" a term most frequently employed to\r\nsignify the whole, but which can correctly be used to signify anything\r\nwhich a man is entitled to represent of an armorial character. Had not the\r\nrecent revival of interest in armory taken place, we should have found a\r\nfirmly rooted and even yet more slipshod declension, for a few years ago\r\nthe habit of the uneducated in styling anything stamped upon a sheet of\r\nnote-paper \"a crest,\" was fast becoming stereotyped into current\r\nacceptance. {60}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE SHIELD\r\n\r\nThe shield is the most important part of the achievement, for on it are\r\ndepicted the signs and emblems of the house to which it appertains; the\r\ndifference marks expressive of the cadency of the members within that\r\nhouse; the augmentations of honour which the Sovereign has conferred; the\r\nquarterings inherited from families which are represented, and the\r\nimpalements of marriage; and it is with the shield principally that the\r\nlaws of armory are concerned, for everything else is dependent upon the\r\nshield, and falls into comparative insignificance alongside of it.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the shield itself, without reference to the charges\r\nit carries. A shield may be depicted in any fashion and after any shape\r\nthat the imagination can suggest, which shape and fashion have been\r\naccepted at any time as the shape and fashion of a shield. There is no law\r\nupon the subject. The various shapes adopted in emblazonments in past ages,\r\nand used at the present time in imitation of past usage--for luckily the\r\npresent period has evolved no special shield of its own--are purely the\r\nresult of artistic design, and have been determined at the periods they\r\nhave been used in heraldic art by no other consideration than the\r\nparticular theory of design that has happened to dominate the decoration,\r\nand the means and ends of such decoration of that period. The lozenge\r\ncertainly is reserved for and indicative of the achievements of the female\r\nsex, but, save for this one exception, the matter may be carried further,\r\nand arms be depicted upon a banner, a parallelogram, a square, a circle, or\r\nan oval; and even then one would be correct, for the purposes of armory, in\r\ndescribing such figures as shields on all occasions on which they are made\r\nthe vehicles for the emblazonment of a design which properly and originally\r\nshould be borne upon a shield. Let no one think that a design ceases to be\r\na coat of arms if it is not displayed upon a shield. Many people have\r\nthought to evade the authority of the Crown as the arbiter of coat-armour,\r\nand the penalties of taxation imposed by the Revenue by using designs\r\nwithout depicting them upon a shield. This little deception has always been\r\nborne in mind, {61} for we find in the Royal Warrants of Queen Elizabeth\r\ncommanding the Visitations that the King of Arms to whom the warrant was\r\naddressed was to \"correcte, cumptrolle and refourme all mann' of armes,\r\ncrests, cognizaunces and devices unlawfull or unlawfully usurped, borne or\r\ntaken by any p'son or p'sons within the same p'vince cont^ary to the due\r\norder of the laws of armes, and the same to rev'se, put downe or otherwise\r\ndeface at his discrecon as well in coote armors, helmes, standerd, pennons\r\nand hatchmets of tents and pavilions, as also in plate jewells, pap',\r\nparchement, wyndowes, gravestones and monuments, or elsewhere wheresoev'\r\nthey be sett or placed, whether they be in shelde, schoocheon, lozenge,\r\nsquare, rundell or otherwise howsoev' cont^arie to the autentiq' and\r\nauncient lawes, customes, rules, privileges and orders of armes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Taken from the tomb of Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count\r\nof Anjou.]\r\n\r\nThe Act 32 & 33 Victoria, section 19, defines (for the purpose of the\r\ntaxation it enforced) armorial bearings to mean and include \"any armorial\r\nbearing, crest, or ensign, by whatever name the same shall be called, and\r\nwhether such armorial bearing, crest, or ensign shall be registered in the\r\nCollege of Arms or not.\"\r\n\r\nThe shape of the shield throughout the rest of Europe has also varied\r\nbetween wide extremes, and at no time has any one particular shape been\r\nassigned to or peculiar to any country, rank, or condition, save possibly\r\nwith one exception, namely, that the use of the cartouche or oval seems to\r\nhave been very nearly universal with ecclesiastics in France, Spain, and\r\nItaly, though never reserved exclusively for their use. Probably this was\r\nan attempt on the part of the Church to get away from the military\r\ncharacter of the shield. It is in keeping with the rule by which, even at\r\nthe present day, a bishop or a cardinal bears neither helmet nor crest,\r\nusing in place thereof his ecclesiastical mitre or tasselled hat, and by\r\nwhich the clergy, both abroad and in this country, seldom made use of a\r\ncrest in depicting their arms. A clergyman in this country, however, has\r\nnever been denied the right of using a crest (if he possesses one and\r\nchooses to display it) until he reaches episcopal rank. A grant of arms to\r\na clergyman at the present day depicts his achievement with helmet,\r\nmantling, and crest in identical form with those adopted for any one else.\r\nBut the laws of armory, official and amateur, have always denied the right\r\nto make use of a crest to bishop, archbishop, and cardinal.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, if a grant of arms is made to a bishop of the\r\nEstablished Church, the emblazonment at the head of his patent consists of\r\nshield and mitre only. The laws of the Church of England, however, require\r\nno vow of celibacy from its ecclesiastics, and consequently the descendants\r\nof a bishop would be placed in the position of having no crest to display\r\nif the bishop and his requirements were {62} alone considered. So that in\r\nthe case of a grant to a bishop the crest is granted for his descendants in\r\na separate clause, being depicted by itself in the body of the patent apart\r\nfrom the emblazonment \"in the margin hereof,\" which in an ordinary patent\r\nis an emblazonment of the whole achievement. A similar method is usually\r\nadopted in cases in which the actual patentee is a woman, and where, by the\r\nlimitations attached to the patent being extended beyond herself, males are\r\nbrought in who will bear the arms granted to the patentee as their\r\npronominal arms. In these cases the arms of the patentee are depicted upon\r\na lozenge at the head of the patent, the crest being depicted separately\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhilst shields were actually used in warfare the utilitarian article\r\nlargely governed the shape of the artistic representation, but after the\r\nfifteenth century the latter gradually left the beaten track of utility and\r\npassed wholly into the cognisance of art and design. The earliest shape of\r\nall is the long, narrow shape, which is now but seldom seen. This was\r\ncurved to protect the body, which it nearly covered, and an interesting\r\nexample of this is to be found in the monumental slab of champlevé enamel,\r\npart of the tomb of Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou (Fig. 28), the\r\nancestor of our own Royal dynasty of Plantagenet, who died in the year\r\n1150. This tomb was formerly in the cathedral of Le Mans, and is now in the\r\nmuseum there. I shall have occasion again to refer to it. The shield is\r\nblue; the lions are gold.\r\n\r\nOther forms of the same period are found with curved tops, in the shape of\r\nan inverted pear, but the form known as the heater-shaped shield is to all\r\nintents and purposes the earliest shape which was used for armorial\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe church of St. Elizabeth at Marburg, in Hesse, affords examples of\r\nshields which are exceedingly interesting, inasmuch as they are {63}\r\noriginal and contemporary even if only pageant shields. Those which now\r\nremain are the shields of the Landgrave Konrad (d. 1241) of Thuringia and\r\nof Henry of Thuringia (d. 1298). The shield of the former (see Fig. 29) is\r\n90 centimetres high and 74 wide. Konrad was Landgrave of Thuringia and\r\nGrand Master of the Teutonic Order of Knighthood. His arms show the lion of\r\nThuringia barry of gules and argent on a field of azure, and between the\r\nhind feet a small shield, with the arms of the Teutonic Order of Knights.\r\nThe only remains of the lion's mane are traces of the nails. The body of\r\nthe lion is made of pressed leather, and the yellow claws have been\r\nsupplied with a paint-brush. A precious stone probably represented the eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Shield of the Landgrave Konrad of Thuringia (died\r\n1241).]\r\n\r\nThe making and decorating of the shields lay mostly in the hands of the\r\nherald painters, known in Germany as _Schilter_, who, in addition to\r\nattending to the shield and crest, also had charge of all the riding\r\nparaphernalia, because most of the articles comprised therein were {64}\r\nheraldically decorated. Many of these shield-workers' fraternities won\r\nwidespread fame for themselves, and enjoyed great consideration at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThus the \"History of a Celebrated Painters' Guild on the Lower Rhine\" tells\r\nus of costly shields which the shield-workers of Paris had supplied, 1260,\r\n&c. Vienna, too, was the home of a not unimportant shield-workers' guild,\r\nand the town archives of Vienna contain writings of the fifteenth century\r\ntreating of this subject. For instance, we learn that in an order of St.\r\nLuke's parish, June 28, 1446, with regard to the masterpiece of a member of\r\nthe guild--\r\n\r\n\"Item, a shield-worker shall make four new pieces of work with his own\r\nhand, a jousting saddle, a leather apron, a horse's head-piece, and a\r\njousting shield, that shall he do in eight weeks, and must be able to paint\r\nit with his own hand, as Knight and man-at-arms shall direct.\"\r\n\r\nThe shield was of wood, covered with linen or leather, the charges in\r\nrelief and painted. Leather plastic was very much esteemed in the early\r\nMiddle Ages. The leather was soaked in oil, and pressed or beaten into\r\nshape. Besides piecing and leather plastic, pressed linen (linen dipped in\r\nchalk and lime) was also used, and a kind of tempera painting on a chalk\r\nbackground. After the shield was decorated with the charges, it was\r\nfrequently strengthened with metal clasps, or studs, particularly those\r\nparts which were more especially exposed to blows and pressure. These\r\nclasps and nails originally had no other object than to make the shield\r\nstronger and more durable, but later on their nature was misunderstood;\r\nthey were treated and used as genuine heraldic charges, and stereotyped\r\ninto hereditary designs. The long strips with which the edge was bound were\r\ncalled the \"frame\" (_Schildgestell_), the clasps introduced in the middle\r\nof the shield the \"buckle\" or \"umbo\" (see on Fig. 28), from which\r\nfrequently circularly arranged metal snaps reached the edge of the shield.\r\nThis latter method of strengthening the shield was called the \"Buckelrîs,\"\r\na figure which was afterwards frequently employed as a heraldic charge, and\r\nis known in Germany by the name of _Lilienhaspel_ (Lily-staple) or\r\n_Glevenrad_, or, as we term it in England, the escarbuncle.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the fourteenth century, when the tournament provided\r\nthe chief occasion for the shield, the jousting-shield, called in Germany\r\nthe _Tartsche_ or _Tartscher_, came into use, and from this class of shield\r\nthe most varied shapes were gradually developed. These _Tartschen_ were\r\ndecidedly smaller than the earlier Gothic shields, being only about\r\none-fifth of a man's height. They were concave, and had on the side of the\r\nknight's right hand a circular indentation. This was the spear-rest, in\r\nwhich to place the tilting-spear. The later {65} art of heraldic decoration\r\nsymmetrically repeated the spear-rest on the sinister side of the shield,\r\nand, by so doing, transformed a useful fact into a matter of mere artistic\r\ndesign. Doubtless it was argued that if indentations were correct at one\r\npoint in the outline they were correct at another, and when once the actual\r\nfact was departed from the imagination of designers knew no limits. But if\r\nthe spear-rest as such is introduced into the outline of a shield it should\r\nbe on the dexter side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\r\n\r\nReverting to the various shapes of shield, however, the degeneration is\r\nexplained by a remark of Mr. G. W. Eve in the able book which he has\r\nrecently published under the title of \"Decorative Heraldry,\" in which,\r\nalluding to heraldic art in general, he says (p. 235):--\r\n\r\n\"With the Restoration heraldry naturally became again conspicuous, with the\r\nworst form of the Renaissance character in full sway, the last vestiges of\r\nthe Gothic having disappeared. Indeed, the contempt with which the\r\nsuperseded style was regarded amounted to fanaticism, and explains, in a\r\nmeasure, how so much of good could be relinquished in favour of so weak a\r\nsuccessor.\"\r\n\r\nLater came the era of gilded embellishments, of flowing palms, of borders\r\ndecorated with grinning heads, festoons of ribbon, and fruit and flowers in\r\nabundance. The accompanying examples are reproduced from a book, Knight and\r\nRumley's \"Heraldry.\" The book is not particularly well known to the public,\r\ninasmuch as its circulation was entirely confined to heraldic artists,\r\ncoach-painters, engravers, and die-sinkers. Amongst these handicraftsmen\r\nits reputation was and is great. With the school of design it adopted,\r\nlittle or no sympathy now exists, but a short time ago (how short many of\r\nthose who are now vigorous advocates of the Gothic and mediæval styles\r\nwould be startled to realise were they to recognise actual facts) no other\r\nstyle was known or considered by the public. As examples of that style the\r\nplates of Knight and Rumley were admittedly far in advance of any other\r\nbook, and as specimens of copperplate engraving they are superb. Figs. 30,\r\n31, and 32 show typical examples of escutcheons from Knight and Rumley; and\r\nas the volume was in the hands of most of the heraldic handicraftsmen, it\r\nwill be found that this type of design was constantly to be met with. The\r\nexternal decoration of the shield was carried to great lengths, and Fig. 31\r\nfound many admirers and users amongst the gallant \"sea-dogs\" of the\r\nkingdom. In fact, so far was the idea carried that a trophy of military\r\nweapons was actually granted by patent as part of the supporters of the\r\nEarl of Bantry. Fig. 30, from the same source, is the military equivalent.\r\nThese plates are interesting as being some of the examples from which most\r\nof the heraldic handicraft of a recent period was adapted. The {66}\r\nofficial shield eventually stereotyped itself into a shape akin to that\r\nshown in Fig. 32, though nowadays considerable latitude is permitted. For\r\npaintings which are not upon patents the design of the shield rests with\r\nthe individual taste of the different officers of arms, and recently some\r\nof the work for which they have been responsible has reached a high\r\nstandard judged even by the strictest canons of art. In Scotland, until\r\nvery recently, the actual workmanship of the emblazonments which were\r\nissued from Lyon Office was so wretchedly poor that one is hardly justified\r\nin taking them into consideration as a type. With the advent into office of\r\nthe present Lyon King of Arms (Sir James Balfour Paul), a complete change\r\nhas been made, and both the workmanship and design of the paintings upon\r\nthe patents of grant and matriculation, and also in the Lyon Register, have\r\nbeen examples of everything that could be desired. {67}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE FIELD OF A SHIELD AND THE HERALDIC TINCTURES\r\n\r\nThe shield itself and its importance in armory is due to its being the\r\nvehicle whereon are elaborated the pictured emblems and designs which\r\nconstitute coat-armour. It should be borne in mind that theoretically all\r\nshields are of equal value, saving that a shield of more ancient date is\r\nmore estimable than one of recent origin, and the shield of the head of the\r\nhouse takes precedence of the same arms when differenced for a younger\r\nmember of the family. A shield crowded with quarterings is interesting\r\ninasmuch as each quartering in the ordinary event means the representation\r\nthrough a female of some other family or branch thereof. But the real value\r\nof such a shield should be judged rather by the age of the single\r\nquartering which represents the strict male descent male upon male, and a\r\nsimple coat of arms without quarterings may be a great deal more ancient\r\nand illustrious than a shield crowded with coat upon coat. A fictitious and\r\nfar too great estimation is placed upon the right to display a long string\r\nof quarterings. In reality quarterings are no more than accidents, because\r\nthey are only inherited when the wife happens to be an heiress in blood. It\r\nis quite conceivable that there may be families, in fact there are such\r\nfamilies, who are able to begin their pedigrees at the time of the\r\nConquest, and who have married a long succession of noble women, all of the\r\nhighest birth, but yet none of whom have happened to be heiresses.\r\nConsequently the arms, though dating from the earliest period at which arms\r\nare known, would remain in their simple form without the addition of a\r\nsolitary quartering. On the other hand, I have a case in mind of a marriage\r\nwhich took place some years ago. The husband is the son of an alien whose\r\noriginal position, if report speaks truly, was that of a pauper immigrant.\r\nHis wealth and other attributes have placed him in a good social position;\r\nbut he has no arms, and, as far as the world is aware, no ancestry\r\nwhatever. Let us now consider his wife's family. Starting soon after the\r\nConquest, its descendants obtained high position and married heiress after\r\nheiress, and before the commencement of this century had amassed a shield\r\nof quarterings which can readily be proved to be little short of a hundred\r\nin number. Probably the number {68} is really much greater. A large family\r\nfollowed in one generation, and one of the younger sons is the ancestor of\r\nthe aforesaid wife. But the father of this lady never had any sons, and\r\nthough there are many males of the name to carry on the family in the\r\nsenior line and also in several younger branches, the wife, by the absence\r\nof brothers, happens to be a coheir; and as such she transmits to her issue\r\nthe right to all the quarterings she has inherited. If the husband ever\r\nobtains a grant of arms, the date of them will be subsequent to the present\r\ntime; but supposing such a grant to be obtained, the children will\r\ninevitably inherit the scores of quarterings which belong to their mother.\r\nNow it would be ridiculous to suppose that such a shield is better or such\r\na descent more enviable than the shield of a family such as I first\r\ndescribed. Quarterings are all very well in their way, but their\r\nglorification has been carried too far.\r\n\r\nA shield which displays an augmentation is of necessity more honourable\r\nthan one without. At the same time no scale of precedence has ever been\r\nlaid down below the rank of esquires; and if such precedence does really\r\nexist at all, it can only be according to the date of the grant. Here in\r\nEngland the possession of arms carries with it no style or title, and\r\nnothing in his designation can differentiate the position of Mr. Scrope of\r\nDanby, the male descendant of one of the oldest families in this country,\r\nwhose arms were upheld in the Scrope and Grosvenor controversy in 1390, or\r\nMr. Daubeney of Cote, from a Mr. Smith, whose known history may have\r\ncommenced at the Foundling Hospital twenty years ago. In this respect\r\nEnglish usage stands apart, for whilst a German is \"Von\" and a Frenchman\r\nwas \"De,\" if of noble birth, there is no such apparent distinction in\r\nEngland, and never has been. The result has been that the technical\r\nnobility attaching to the possession of arms is overlooked in this country.\r\nOn the Continent it is usual for a patent creating a title to contain a\r\ngrant of the arms, because it is recognised that the two are inseparable.\r\nThis is not now the case in England, where the grant of arms is one thing\r\nand the grant of the title another, and where it is possible, as in the\r\ncase of Lord St. Leonards, to possess a peerage without ever having\r\nobtained the first step in rank, which is nobility or gentility.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is in explanation of the fact that except in the matter of\r\ndate all shields are equal in value.\r\n\r\nSo much being understood, it is possible to put that consideration on one\r\nside, and speaking from the artistically technical point of view, the\r\nremark one often hears becomes correct, that the simpler a coat of arms the\r\nbetter. The remark has added truth from the fact that most ancient coats of\r\narms were simple, and many modern coats are far from being worthy of such a\r\ndescription. {69}\r\n\r\nA coat of arms must consist of at least one thing, to wit, the \"field.\"\r\nThis is equivalent in ordinary words to the colour of the ground of the\r\nshield. A great many writers have asserted that every coat of arms must\r\nconsist of at least the field, and a charge, though most have mentioned as\r\na solitary exception the arms of Brittany, which were simply \"ermine.\" A\r\nplain shield of ermine (Fig. 33) was borne by John of Brittany, Earl of\r\nRichmond (d. 1399), though some of his predecessors had relegated the arms\r\nof Brittany to a \"quarter ermine\" upon more elaborate escutcheons (Fig.\r\n61). This idea as to arms of one tincture was, however, exploded in\r\nWoodward and Burnett's \"Treatise on Heraldry,\" where no less than forty\r\ndifferent examples are quoted. The above-mentioned writer continues: \"There\r\nis another use of a plain red shield which must not be omitted. In the full\r\nquartered coat of some high sovereign princes of Germany--Saxony (duchies),\r\nBrandenburg (Prussia), Bavaria, Anhalt--appears a plain red quartering;\r\nthis is known as the _Blut Fahne_ or _Regalien_ quarter, and is indicative\r\nof Royal prerogatives. It usually occupies the base of the shield, and is\r\noften diapered.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Arms of John (de Montfort, otherwise de Bretagne),\r\nDuke of Brittany and Earl of Richmond. (From his seal.)]\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the lengthy list which is quoted in Woodward and Burnett,\r\nthe fact remains that only one British instance is included. The family of\r\nBerington of Chester (on the authority of Harleian manuscript No. 1535) is\r\nsaid to bear a plain shield of azure. Personally I doubt this coat of arms\r\nfor the Berington family of Chester, which is probably connected with the\r\nneighbouring family in Shropshire, who in later times certainly used very\r\ndifferent arms. The plain shield of ermine is sometimes to be found as a\r\nquartering for Brittany in the achievement of those English families who\r\nhave the right to quarter the Royal arms; but I know of no other British\r\ncase in which, either as a quartering or as a pronominal coat, arms of one\r\ntincture exist.\r\n\r\nBut there are many coats which have no charge, the distinctive device\r\nconsisting of the partition of the shield in some recognised heraldic\r\nmethod into two or more divisions of different tinctures. Amongst such\r\ncoats may be mentioned the arms of Waldegrave, which are simply: Party per\r\npale argent and gules; Drummond of Megginch, whose arms are simply: Party\r\nper fess wavy or and gules; and the arms of Boyle, which are: Per bend\r\nembattled argent and gules. The arms of Berners--which are: Quarterly or\r\nand vert--are another example, as are the arms of Campbell (the first\r\nquarter in the Duke of Argyll's achievement), which are: Gyronny or and\r\nsable. {70}\r\n\r\nThe coat bendy argent and gules, the ancient arms of Talbot, which are\r\nstill borne as a quartering by the Earl of Shrewsbury, Waterford, and\r\nTalbot; and the coat chequy or and azure, a quartering for Warren, which is\r\nstill borne by the House of Howard, all come within the same category.\r\nThere are many other coats of this character which have no actual charge\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the shield is termed the field when it consists of only one\r\ncolour, and when it consists of more than one colour the two together\r\ncompose the field. The field is usually of one or more of the recognised\r\nmetals, colours, or furs.\r\n\r\nThe metals are gold and silver, these being termed \"or\" and \"argent.\" The\r\ncolours, which are really the \"tinctures,\" if this word is to be used\r\ncorrectly, are: gules (red), azure (blue), vert (green), purpure (purple),\r\nand (in spite of the fact that it is not really a colour) black, which is\r\nknown as sable.\r\n\r\nThe metal gold, otherwise \"or,\" is often represented in emblazonments by\r\nyellow: as a matter of fact yellow has always been used for gold in the\r\nRegister Books of the College of Arms, and Lyon Office has recently\r\nreverted to this practice. In ancient paintings and emblazonments the use\r\nof yellow was rather more frequent than the use of gold, but gold at all\r\ntimes had its use, and was never discarded. Gold seems to have been usually\r\nused upon ancient patents, whilst yellow was used in the registrations of\r\nthem retained in the Offices of Arms, but I know of no instance in British\r\narmory in which the word yellow has been used in a blazon to represent any\r\ntint distinct from gold. With regard to the other metal, silver, or, as it\r\nis always termed, \"argent,\" the same variation is found in the usage of\r\nsilver and white in representing argent that we find in yellow and gold,\r\nthough we find that the use of the actual metal (silver) in emblazonment\r\ndoes not occur to anything like the same extent as does the use of gold.\r\nProbably this is due to the practical difficulty that no one has yet\r\ndiscovered a silver medium which does not lose its colour. The use of\r\naluminium was thought to have solved the difficulty, but even this loses\r\nits brilliancy, and probably its usage will never be universally adopted.\r\nThis is a pity, for the use of gold in emblazonments gives a brilliancy in\r\neffect to a collection of coat-armour which it is a pity cannot be extended\r\nby an equivalent usage of silver. The use of silver upon the patents at the\r\nCollege of Arms has been discontinued some centuries, though aluminium is\r\nstill in use in Lyon Office. Argent is therefore usually represented either\r\nby leaving the surface untouched, or by the use of Chinese white.\r\n\r\nI believe I am the first heraldic writer to assert the existence of the\r\nheraldic colour of white in addition to the heraldic argent. Years ago {71}\r\nI came across the statement that a white label belonged only to the Royal\r\nFamily, and could be used by no one else. I am sorry to say that though I\r\nhave searched high and low I cannot find the authority for the statement,\r\nnor can I learn from any officer of arms that the existence of such a rule\r\nis asserted; but there is this curious confirmation that in the warrants by\r\nwhich the various labels are assigned to the different members of the Royal\r\nFamily, the labels are called white labels. Now the label of the Prince of\r\nWales is of three points and is plain. Heraldry knows nothing of the black\r\nlines which in drawing a coat of arms usually appear for the outline of a\r\ncharge. In older work such lines are absent. In any case they are only mere\r\naccidents of draughtsmanship. Bearing this in mind, and bearing in mind\r\nthat the sinister supporter of the Prince of Wales is a unicorn argent, how\r\non earth is a plain label of argent to be depicted thereupon? Now it is\r\nnecessary also that the label shall be placed upon the crest, which is a\r\nlion statant guardant or, crowned with the coronet of the Prince, and upon\r\nthe dexter supporter which is another golden lion; to place an argent label\r\nupon either is a flat violation of the rule which requires that metal shall\r\nnot be placed upon metal, nor colour upon colour; but if the unicorn is\r\nconsidered argent, which it is, it would if really depicted in silver be\r\nquite possible to paint a white label upon it, for the distinction between\r\nwhite and silver is marked, and a white label upon a gold lion is not metal\r\nupon metal. Quite recently a still further and startling confirmation has\r\ncome under my notice. In the grant of a crest to Thomas Mowbray, Earl of\r\nNottingham, the coronet which is to encircle the neck of the leopard is\r\ndistinctly blazoned argent, the label to which he is previously said to\r\nhave had a just hereditary right is as distinctly blazoned white, and the\r\nwhole grant is so short that inadvertence could hardly be pleaded as an\r\nexplanation for the distinction in blazon. Instances of an official\r\nexemplification of coats of arms with labels are not uncommon, because the\r\nlabel in some number of families, for example Courtenay and Prideaux-Brune\r\nand Barrington, has become stereotyped into a charge. In none of these\r\ncases, however, is it either argent or white, but instances of the\r\nexemplification of a coat of arms bearing a label as a mark of cadency are,\r\noutside the members of the Royal Family, distinctly rare; they are\r\nnecessarily so, because outside the Royal Family the label is merely the\r\ntemporary mark of the eldest son or grandson during the lifetime of the\r\nhead of the house, and the necessity for the exemplification of the arms of\r\nan eldest son can seldom occur. The one circumstance which might provide us\r\nwith the opportunity is the exemplification consequent upon a change of\r\nname and arms by an eldest son during the lifetime of his father; but {72}\r\nthis very circumstance fails to provide it, because the exemplification\r\nonly follows a change of arms, and the arms being changed, there no longer\r\nexists the necessity for a mark of cadency; so that instances of the\r\nofficial use of a label for cadency are rare, but of such as occur I can\r\nlearn of none which has received official sanction which blazons the label\r\nwhite. There is, however, one coat which is said to have a label argent as\r\na charge, this is the coat of Fitz-Simon, which is quoted in Papworth, upon\r\nthe authority of one of the Harleian Manuscripts, as follows: Sable, three\r\ncrescents, in chief a label of two drops and in fess another of one drop\r\nargent; and the same coat of arms is recorded in a funeral entry in\r\nUlster's Office. The label is not here termed white, and it is peculiar\r\nthat we find it of another colour in another coat of Fitz-Simon (azure, a\r\nlion rampant ermine, a label of four point gules).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Armorial bearings of Henry de Lacy, Earl of\r\nLincoln (d. 1311): Or, a lion rampant purpure. (From his seal.)]\r\n\r\nOf other colours may be mentioned purpure (purple). This in English\r\nheraldry is a perfectly well recognised colour, and though its use is\r\nextremely rare in comparison with the others, it will be found too\r\nfrequently for it to be classed as an exception. The earliest instance of\r\nthis tincture which I have met with is in the coat of De Lacy (Fig. 34).\r\nThe Roll of Caerlaverock speaks of his\r\n\r\n \"Baniere ot de un cendall saffrin,\r\n  O un lion rampant porprin,\"\r\n\r\nwhilst MS. Cott. Calig. A. xviii. quotes the arms: \"_De or, a un lion\r\nrampaund de pourpre_.\" The Burton coat of the well-known Shropshire family\r\nof Lingen-Burton is: Quarterly purpure and azure, a cross engrailed or\r\nbetween four roses argent. The Irish baronets of the name of Burton, who\r\nclaimed descent from this family, bore a very similar coat, namely: Per\r\npale azure and purpure, a cross engrailed or between four roses argent.\r\n\r\nTwo other colours will be found in nearly all text-books of English armory.\r\nThese are murrey or sanguine, and orange or tenné. The exact tint of murrey\r\nis between gules and purpure; and tenné is an orange-tawny colour. They are\r\nboth \"stains,\" and were perhaps invented by the old heralds for the\r\nperpetration of their preposterous system of abatements, which will be\r\nfound set out in full in the old heraldry books, but which have yet to be\r\nfound occurring in fact. The subject of abatements is one of those pleasant\r\nlittle insanities which have done so much to the detriment of heraldry.\r\nOne, and one only, can be said {73} to have had the slightest foundation in\r\nfact; that was the entire reversal of the escutcheon in the ceremony of\r\ndegradation following upon attainder for high treason. Even this, however,\r\nwas but temporary, for a man forfeited his arms entirely by attainder. They\r\nwere torn down from his banner of knighthood; they were erased in the\r\nrecords of the College of Arms; but on that one single occasion when he was\r\ndrawn upon a hurdle to the place of his execution, they are said to have\r\nbeen painted reversed upon paper, which paper was fastened to his breast.\r\nBut the arms then came to an end, and his descendants possessed none at\r\nall. They certainly had not the right to depict their shield upside down\r\n(even if they had cared to display such a monstrosity). Unless and until\r\nthe attainder was reversed, arms (like a title) were void; and the proof of\r\nthis is to be found in the many regrants of arms made in cases where the\r\nattainder has remained, as in the instances of the Earl of Stafford and the\r\nancestor of the present Lord Barnard. But that any person should have been\r\nsupposed to have been willing to make use of arms carrying an abatement is\r\npreposterous, and no instance of such usage is known. Rather would a man\r\ndecline to bear arms at all; and that any one should have imagined the\r\nexistence of a person willing to advertise himself as a drunkard or an\r\nadulterer, with variations in the latter case according to the personality\r\nof his partner in guilt, is idiotic in the extreme. Consequently, as no\r\nexample of an abatement has ever been found, one might almost discard the\r\n\"stains\" of murrey and tenné were it not that they were largely made use of\r\nfor the purposes of liveries, in which usage they had no such objectionable\r\nmeaning. At the present day scarlet or gules being appropriated to the\r\nRoyal Family for livery purposes, other people possessing a shield of gules\r\nare required to make use of a different red, and though it is now termed\r\nchocolate or claret colour by the utilitarian language of the day, it is in\r\nreality nothing more than the old sanguine or murrey. Of orange-tawny I can\r\nlearn of but one livery at the present day. I refer to the orange-tawny\r\ncoats used by the hunt servants of Lord Fitzhardinge, and now worn by the\r\nhunt servants of the Old Berkeley country, near London. _A propos_ of this\r\nit is interesting to note the curious legend that the \"pink\" of the hunting\r\nfield is not due to any reasons of optical advantage, but to an entirely\r\ndifferent reason. Formerly no man might hunt even on his own estate until\r\nhe had had licence of free warren from the Crown. Consequently he merely\r\nhunted by the pleasure of the Crown, taking part in what was exclusively a\r\nRoyal sport by Royal permission, and for this Royal sport he wore the\r\nKing's livery of scarlet. This being the case, it is a curious anomaly that\r\nalthough the livery of the only Royal pack recently in existence, the Royal\r\nBuck Hounds, was scarlet and gold, the Master {74} wore a green coat. The\r\nlegend may be a fallacy, inasmuch as scarlet did not become the Royal\r\nlivery until the accession of the Stuarts; but it is by no means clear to\r\nwhat date the scarlet hunting coat can be traced.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one undoubted instance of the use of sanguine for the\r\nfield of a coat of arms, namely, the arms of Clayhills of Invergowrie,[6]\r\nwhich are properly matriculated in Lyon Register.\r\n\r\nTo these colours German heraldry has added brown, blood-red (this\r\napparently is different from the English sanguine, as a different hatching\r\nhas been invented for it), earth-colour, iron-grey, water-colour,\r\nflesh-colour, ashen-grey, orange (here also a separate hatching from the\r\none to represent tenné has been invented), and the colour of nature, _i.e._\r\n\"proper.\" These doubtless are not intended to be added to the list of\r\nheraldic tinctures, but are noted because various hatchings have been\r\ninvented in modern times to represent them.\r\n\r\nMr. Woodward, in Woodward and Burnett's \"Treatise on Heraldry,\" alludes to\r\nvarious tinctures amongst Continental arms which he has come across.\r\n\r\n\"Besides the metals, tinctures, and furs which have been already described,\r\nother tinctures are occasionally found in the Heraldry of Continental\r\nnations; but are comparatively of such rarity as that they may be counted\r\namong the curiosities of blazon, which would require a separate volume.\r\nThat of which I have collected instances is Cendrée, or ash colour, which\r\nis borne by (among others) the Bavarian family of Ashua, as its _armes\r\nparlantes: Cendrée, a mount of three coupeaux in base or_.\r\n\r\n\"_Brunâtre_, a brown colour, is even more rare as a tincture of the field;\r\nthe MIEROSZEWSKY in Silesia bear, '_de Brunâtre, A cross patée argent\r\nsupporting a raven rising sable, and holding in its beak a horseshoe\r\nproper, its points towards the chief_.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Bleu-céleste_, or _bleu du ciel_, appears occasionally, apart from what\r\nwe may term 'landscape coats.' That it differs from, and is a much lighter\r\ncolour than, azure is shown by the following example. The Florentine CINTI\r\n(now CINI) bear a coat which would be numbered among the _armes fausses, or\r\nà enquérir: Per pale azure and bleu-céleste, an estoile counterchanged_.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Amaranth_ or _columbine_ is the field of a coat (of which the blazon is\r\ntoo lengthy for insertion in this place) which was granted to a Bohemian\r\nknight in 1701.\"\r\n\r\nCarnation is the French term for the colour of naked flesh, and is often\r\nemployed in the blazonry of that country. {75}\r\n\r\nPerhaps mention should here be made of the English term \"proper.\" Anything,\r\nalive or otherwise, which is depicted in its natural colours is termed\r\n\"proper,\" and it should be depicted in its really correct tones or tints,\r\nwithout any attempt to assimilate these with any heraldic tincture. It will\r\nnot be found in the very ancient coats of arms, and its use is not to be\r\nencouraged. When a natural animal is found existing in various colours it\r\nis usual to so describe it, for the term \"proper\" alone would leave\r\nuncertainty. For instance, the crest of the Lane family, which was granted\r\nto commemorate the ride of King Charles II. behind Mistress Jane Lane as\r\nher servant, in his perilous escape to the coast after the disastrous\r\nBattle of Worcester, is blazoned \"a strawberry roan horse, couped at the\r\nflanks proper, bridled sable, and holding between the feet an Imperial\r\ncrown also proper.\" Lord Cowper's supporters were, on either side of the\r\nescutcheon, \"a light dun horse proper, with a large blaze down the face,\r\nthe mane close shorn except a tuft on the withers, a black list down the\r\nback, a bob tail, and the near fore-foot and both hind feet white.\" Another\r\ninstance that might be quoted are the supporters of Lord Newlands, which\r\nare: \"On either side a dapple-grey horse proper, gorged with a riband and\r\nsuspended therefrom an escutcheon gules, charged with three bezants in\r\nchevron.\" The crest of the family of Bewes, of St. Neots, Cornwall, is: \"On\r\na chapeau gules, turned up ermine, a pegasus rearing on his hind legs of a\r\nbay colour, the mane and tail sable, winged or, and holding in the mouth a\r\nsprig of laurel proper.\"\r\n\r\nThere are and were always many occasions in which it was desired to\r\nrepresent armorial bearings in black and white, or where from the nature of\r\nthe handicraft it was impossible to make use of actual colour. But it\r\nshould always be pointedly remembered that unless the right colours of the\r\narms could be used the tinctures were entirely ignored in all matters of\r\nhandicraft until the seventeenth century. Various schemes of hatchings,\r\nhowever, were adopted for the purpose of indicating the real heraldic\r\ncolours when arms were represented and the real colours could not be\r\nemployed, the earliest being that of Francquart in Belgium, _circa_ 1623.\r\nWoodward says this was succeeded by the systems of Butkens, 1626; Petra\r\nSancta, 1638; Lobkowitz, 1639; Gelenius; and De Rouck, 1645; but all these\r\nsystems differed from each other, and were for a time the cause of\r\nconfusion and not of order. Eventually, however, the system of Petra Sancta\r\n(the author of _Tesseræ Gentilitia_) superseded all the others, and has\r\nremained in use up to the present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.]\r\n\r\nUpon this point Herr Ströhl in his _Heraldischer Atlas_ remarks: \"The\r\nsystem of hatching used by Marcus Vulson de la Colombière, 1639, in the\r\ncourse of time found acceptance everywhere, and has {76} maintained itself\r\nin use unaltered until the present day, and these are shown in Fig. 35,\r\nonly that later, hatchings have been invented for brown, grey, &c.; which,\r\nhowever, seems rather a superfluous enriching.\" None of these later\r\ncreations, by the way, have ever been used in this country. For the sake of\r\ncompleteness, however, let them be mentioned (see Fig. 36): _a_, brown;\r\n_b_, blood-red; _c_, earth-colour; _d_, iron-grey; _e_, water-colour; _f_,\r\nflesh-colour; _g_, ashen-grey; _h_, orange; and _i_, colour of nature. In\r\nEnglish armory \"tenné\" is represented by a combination of horizontal (as\r\nazure) lines with diagonal lines from sinister to dexter (as purpure), and\r\nsanguine or murrey by a combination of diagonal lines from dexter to\r\nsinister (as vert), and from sinister to dexter (as purpure).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.]\r\n\r\nThe hatchings of the shield and its charges always accommodate themselves\r\nto the angle at which the shield is placed, those of the crest to the angle\r\nof the helmet. A curious difficulty, however, occurs when a shield, as is\r\nso often the case in this country, forms a part of the crest. Such a shield\r\nis seldom depicted quite upright upon the wreath. Are the tincture lines to\r\nfollow the angle of the smaller shield in the crest or the angle of the\r\nhelmet? Opinion is by no means agreed upon the point.\r\n\r\nBut though this system of representing colours by \"hatching\" has been\r\nadopted and extensively made use of, it is questionable whether {77} it has\r\never received official sanction, at any rate in Great Britain. It certainly\r\nhas never been made use of in any _official_ record or document in the\r\nCollege of Arms. Most of the records are in colour. The remainder are all\r\nwithout exception \"tricked,\" that is, drawn in outline, the colours being\r\nadded in writing in the following contracted forms: \"O,\" or \"or,\" for or;\r\n\"A,\" \"ar,\" or \"arg,\" for argent; \"G,\" or \"gu,\" for gules; \"Az,\" or \"B\" (for\r\nblue, owing to the likelihood of confusion between \"ar\" and \"az,\" \"B\" being\r\nalmost universally used in old trickings), for azure; \"S,\" or \"sa,\" for\r\nsable; \"Vt\" for vert, and \"Purp\" for purpure. It is unlikely that any\r\nchange will be made in the future, for the use of tincture lines is now\r\nvery rapidly being discarded by all good heraldic artists in this country.\r\nWith the reversion to older and better forms and methods these hatchings\r\nbecome an anachronism, and save that sable is represented by solid black\r\nthey will probably be unused and forgotten before very long.\r\n\r\nThe plain, simple names of colours, such as red and green, seemed so\r\nunpoetical and unostentatious to the heralds and poets of the Middle Ages,\r\nthat they substituted for gold, topaz; for silver, pearl or \"meergries\";\r\nfor red, ruby; for blue, sapphire; for green, emerald; and for black,\r\ndiamond or \"zobel\" (sable, the animal, whence the word \"sable\"). Let the\r\nfollowing blazonment from the grant of arms to Mödling bei Wien in 1458\r\nserve as example of the same: \"Mit namen ain Schilt gleich getailt in\r\nfasse, des ober und maister tail von Rubin auch mit ainer fasse von\r\nBerlein, der under thail von grunt des Schilts von Schmaragaden, darinneain\r\nPantel von Silber in Rampannt\"--(_lit._ \"Namely, a shield equally divided\r\nin fess, the upper and greater part of ruby, also with a fess of pearl, the\r\nunder part of the field of the shield of emerald, therein a panther of\r\nsilver, rampant\"); that is, \"Per fess gules and vert, in chief a fess\r\nargent, in base a panther rampant of the last.\"\r\n\r\nEven the planets, and, as abbreviations, their astronomical signs, are\r\noccasionally employed: thus, the _sun_ for gold, the _moon_ for silver,\r\n_Mars_ for red, _Jupiter_ for blue, _Venus_ for green, _Saturn_ for black,\r\nand _Mercury_ for purple. This aberration of intellect on the part of\r\nmediæval heraldic writers, for it really amounted to little more, had very\r\nlittle, if indeed it had any, English official recognition. No one dreams\r\nof using such blazon at the present time, and it might have been entirely\r\ndisregarded were it not that Guillim sanctions its use; and he being the\r\nhigh priest of English armory to so many, his example has given the system\r\na certain currency. I am not myself aware of any instance of the use of\r\nthese terms in an English patent of arms.\r\n\r\nThe furs known to heraldry are now many, but originally they were only two,\r\n\"ermine\" and \"vair.\" Ermine, as every one knows, is of {78} white covered\r\nwith black spots, intended to represent the tails of the animal. From\r\nermine has been evolved the following variations, viz. ermines, erminois,\r\npean, and erminites. \"Ermines\" is a black field with white ermine spots\r\n(the French term for this is _contre-hermin_, the German,\r\n_gegen-hermelin_). A gold background with black ermine spots is styled\r\nerminois, and pean is a black ground with gold ermine spots. Planché\r\nmentions still another, as does Parker in his \"Glossary of Heraldry,\"\r\nnamely, \"erminites,\" which is supposed to be white, with black ermine spots\r\nand a red hair on each side of the spot. I believe there is no instance\r\nknown of any such fur in British armory. It is not mentioned in Ströhl's\r\n\"Heraldic Atlas,\" nor can I find any foreign instance, so that who invented\r\nit, or for what purpose it was invented, I cannot say; and I think it\r\nshould be relegated, with abatements and the _seize quartiers_ of Jesus\r\nChrist, to the category of the silly inventions of former heraldic writers,\r\nnot of former heralds, for I know of no official act which has recognised\r\nthe existence of erminites. The German term for erminois is\r\n_gold-hermelin_, but there are no distinctive terms either in French or\r\nGerman heraldry for the other varieties. Thus, erminois would be in French\r\nblazon: d'or, semé d'hermines de sable; pean would be de sable, semé\r\nd'hermines d'or. Though ermine is always nowadays represented upon a white\r\nbackground, it was sometimes depicted with black ermine spots upon a field\r\nof silver, as in the case of some of the stall plates of the Knights of the\r\nGarter in St. George's Chapel at Windsor. Ermine spots are frequently to be\r\nfound as charges. For instance, in the well-known coat of Kay, which is:\r\n\"Argent, three ermine spots in bend between two bendlets sable, the whole\r\nbetween as many crescents azure.\" As charges two ermine spots figure upon\r\nthe arms recently granted to Sir Francis Laking, Bart., G.C.V.O. The ermine\r\nspot has also sometimes been used in British armory as the difference mark\r\ngranted under a Royal Licence to assume name and arms when it is necessary\r\nto indicate the absence of blood relationship. Other instances of the use\r\nof an ermine spot as a charge are:--\r\n\r\nOr, on two bars azure, as many barrulets dancetté argent, a chief indented\r\nof the second charged with an ermine spot or (Sawbridge).\r\n\r\nArgent, a chevron between three crows sable, in each beak an ermine spot\r\n(Lloyd, Bishop of St. Asaph, 1680; Lichfield, 1692; and Worcester,\r\n1700-17).\r\n\r\nArgent, a fess gules between three ermine spots sable (Kilvington).\r\n\r\nArgent, two bars sable, spotted ermine, in chief a lion passant gules\r\n(Hill, co. Wexford).\r\n\r\nThe earliest form in which ermine was depicted shows a nearer approach to\r\nthe reality of the black tail, inasmuch as the spots above the tail to\r\nwhich we are now accustomed are a modern variant. {79}\r\n\r\nWhen a bend is ermine, the spots (like all other charges placed upon a\r\nbend) must be bendwise; but on a chevron, saltire, &c., they are drawn\r\nupright.\r\n\r\nThe other variety of fur is \"vair.\" This originated from the fur of a kind\r\nof squirrel (the ver or vair, differently spelt; Latin _varus_), which was\r\nmuch used for the lining of cloaks. The animal was bluey-grey upon the back\r\nand white underneath, and the whole skin was used. It will be readily seen\r\nthat by sewing a number of these skins together a result is obtained of a\r\nseries of cup-shaped figures, alternating bluey-grey and white, and this is\r\nwell shown in Fig. 28, which shows the effigy upon the tomb of Geoffrey\r\nPlantagenet, Count of Anjou, where the lining of vair to his cloak is\r\nplainly to be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Arms of William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby (d.\r\n1247): \"Scutum variatum auro & gul.\" (From MS. Cott. Nero, D. 1.)]\r\n\r\nThe word seems to have been used independently of heraldry for fur, and the\r\nfollowing curious error, which is pointed out in Parker's \"Glossary of the\r\nTerms used in Heraldry,\" may be noted in passing. The familiar fairy tale\r\nof Cinderella was brought to us from the French, and the slippers made of\r\nthis costly fur, written, probably, _verre_ for _vairé_, were erroneously\r\ntranslated \"glass\" slippers. This was, of course, an impossible material,\r\nbut the error has always been repeated in the nursery tale-books.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Arms of Robert de Ferrers, Earl of Derby\r\n(1254-1265). (From stained glass in Dorchester Church.)]\r\n\r\nIn the oldest records vair is represented by means of straight horizontal\r\nlines alternating with horizontal wavy or nebuly lines (see Fig. 37), but\r\nthe cup-shaped divisions therefrom resulting having passed through various\r\nintermediate forms (see Fig. 38), have now been stereotyped into a fixed\r\ngeometrical pattern, formed of rows of ear-shaped shields of alternate\r\ncolours and alternately reversed, so depicted that each reversed shield\r\nfits into the space left by those on either side which are not reversed\r\n(see Fig. 39, _k_). The accompanying illustration will show plainly what is\r\nintended. In some of the older designs it was similar to that shown in the\r\narms of the Earl Ferrers, Earl of Derby, 1254-65, the sketch (Fig. 38)\r\nbeing taken from almost contemporary stained glass in Dorchester Church,\r\nOxon.; whilst sometimes the {80} division lines are drawn, after the same\r\nmanner, as _nebuly_. There does not seem to have been any fixed proportion\r\nfor the number of rows of vair, as Fig. 40 shows the arms of the same Earl\r\nas represented upon his seal. The palpable pun upon the name which a shield\r\nvairé supplied no doubt affords the origin of the arms of Ferrers. Some\r\nfamilies of the name at a later date adopted the horseshoes, which are to\r\nbe found upon many Farrer and Ferrers shields, the popular assumption being\r\nthat they are a reference to the \"farrier\" from whom some would derive the\r\nsurname. Woodward, however, states that a horseshoe being the badge of the\r\nMarshalls, horseshoes were assumed as _armes parlantes_ by their\r\ndescendants the Ferrers, who appear to have borne: Sable, six horseshoes\r\nargent. As a matter of fact the only one of that family who bore the\r\nhorseshoes seems to have been William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby (d. 1254),\r\nas will be seen from the arms as on his seal (Fig. 41). {81} His wife was\r\nSybilla, daughter of William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke. His son reverted\r\nto the plain shield of vairé, or, and gules. The arms of the Ferrers family\r\nat a later date are found to be: Gules, seven mascles conjoined or, in\r\nwhich form they are still borne by Ferrers of Baddesley Clinton; but\r\nwhether the mascles are corruptions of the horseshoes, or whether (as seems\r\ninfinitely more probable) they are merely a corrupted form of the vairé,\r\nor, and gules, it is difficult to say. Personally I rather doubt whether\r\nany Ferrers ever used the arms: Argent, six horseshoes sable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Arms of Robert de Ferrers, Earl of Derby\r\n(1254-1265). (From his seal.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Arms of William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby: Vaire,\r\nor, and gules, a bordure argent, charged with eight horseshoes sable. (From\r\na drawing of his seal, MS. Cott. Julius, C vii.)]\r\n\r\nPLATE II.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe early manner of depicting vair is still occasionally met with in\r\nforeign heraldry, where it is blazoned as Vair ondé or Vair ancien. The\r\nfamily of MARGENS in Spain bears: Vair ondé, on a bend gules three griffins\r\nor; and TARRAGONE of Spain: Vair ondé, or and gules. German heraldry seems\r\nto distinguish between _wolkenfeh_ (cloud vair) and _wogenfeh_ (wave vair;\r\nsee Fig. 39, _n_). The former is equivalent to vair ancient, the latter to\r\nvair en point.\r\n\r\nThe verbal blazon of vair nearly always commences with the metal, but in\r\nthe arrangement of the panes there is a difference between French and\r\nEnglish usage. In the former the white panes are generally (and one thinks\r\nmore correctly) represented as forming the first, or upper, line; in\r\nBritish heraldry the reverse is more usually the case. It is usual to\r\ndepict the white panes of ordinary vair with white rather than silver,\r\nthough the use of the latter cannot be said to be incorrect, there being\r\nprecedents in favour of that form. When an ordinary is of vair or vairy,\r\nthe rows of vair may be depicted either horizontally or following the\r\ndirection of the ordinary. There are accepted precedents for both methods.\r\n\r\nVair is always blue and white, but the same subdivision of the field is\r\nfrequently found in other colours; and when this is the case, it is termed\r\nvairy of such and such colours. When it is vairy, it is usually of a colour\r\nand metal, as in the case of Ferrers, Earls of Derby, above referred to;\r\nthough a fur is sometimes found to take the place of one or other, as in\r\nthe arms of Gresley, which are: \"Vairé gules and ermine.\" I know of no\r\ninstance where vairé is found of either two metals or of two colours, nor\r\nat the same time do I know of any rule against such a combination. Probably\r\nit will be time enough to discuss the contingency when an instance comes to\r\nlight. Gerard Leigh mentions vair of three or more tinctures, but instances\r\nare very rare. Parker, in his \"Glossary,\" refers to the coat of Roger\r\nHolthouse, which he blazons: \"Vairy argent, azure, gules, and or, en\r\npoint.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Vair_ of commerce was formerly of three sizes, and the distinction is\r\ncontinued in foreign armory. The middle or ordinary {82} size is known as\r\n_Vair_; a smaller size as _Menu-vair_ (whence our word \"miniver\"); the\r\nlargest as _Beffroi_ or _Gros vair_, a term which is used in armory when\r\nthere are less than four rows. The word _Beffroi_ is evidently derived from\r\nthe bell-like shape of the _vair_, the word _Beffroi_ being anciently used\r\nin the sense of the alarm-bell of a town. In French armory, _Beffroi_\r\nshould consist of three horizontal rows; _Vair_, of four; _Menu-vair_, of\r\nsix. This rule is not strictly observed, but in French blazon if the rows\r\nare more than four it is usual to specify the number; thus Varroux bears:\r\n_de Vair de cinq traits_. _Menu-vair_ is still the blazon of some families;\r\nBANVILLE DE TRUTEMNE bears: _de Menu-vair de six tires_; the Barons van\r\nHOUTHEM bore: _de Menu-vair, au franc quartier de gueules chargé de trois\r\nmaillets d'or_. In British armory the foregoing distinctions are unknown,\r\nand _Vair_ is only of one size, that being at the discretion of the artist.\r\n\r\nWhen the Vair is so arranged that in two horizontal rows taken together,\r\neither the points or the bases of two panes of the same tincture are in\r\napposition, the fur is known as COUNTER VAIR (CONTRE VAIR) (see Fig. 39,\r\n_l_). Another variation, but an infrequent one, is termed VAIR IN PALE,\r\nknown in German heraldry as _Pfahlfeh_ (_Vair appointé_ or _Vair en pal_;\r\nbut if of other colours than the usual ones, _Vairé en pal_). In this all\r\npanes of the same colour are arranged in vertical, or palar, rows (Fig. 39,\r\n_m_). German heraldry apparently distinguishes between this and\r\n_Stürzpfahlfeh_, or _reversed_ vair in pale. VAIR IN BEND (or in\r\nbend-sinister) is occasionally met with in foreign coats; thus MIGNIANELLI\r\nin Italy bears: _Vairé d'or et d'azur en bande_; while _Vairé en barre_\r\n(that is, in bend-sinister) _d'or et de sable_ is the coat of PICHON of\r\nGeneva.\r\n\r\n\"Vair en pointe\" is a term applied by Nisbet to an arrangement by which the\r\nazure shield pointing downwards has beneath it an argent shield pointing\r\ndownwards, and _vice versâ_, by which method the resulting effect is as\r\nshown in Fig. 39, _n_. The German term for this is _Wogenfeh_, or wave\r\nvair. Fig. 39, _o_, shows a purely German variety--_Wechselfeh_, or\r\nalternate vair; and Fig. 39, _p_, which is equivalent to the English vairé\r\nof four colours, is known in German armory as _Buntfeh, i.e._ gay-coloured\r\nor checked vair.\r\n\r\nOrdinary vair in German heraldry is known as _Eisenhüt-feh_, or iron hat\r\nvair. On account of its similarity, when drawn, to the old iron hat of the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries (see Fig. 42), this skin has received\r\nthe name of _Eisenhutlein_ (little iron hat) from German heraldic students,\r\na name which later gave rise to many incorrect interpretations. An old\r\ncharter in the archives of the chapter-house of Lilienfield, in Lower\r\nAustria, under the seal (Fig. 43) of one Chimrad Pellifex, 1329, proves\r\nthat at that time vair was so styled. The name of Pellifex (in {83} German\r\n_Wildwerker_, a worker in skins, or furrier) is expressed in a punning or\r\ncanting form on the dexter side of the shield. This Conrad the Furrier was\r\nBurgomaster of Vienna 1340-43.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of British and foreign families bear _Vair_ only;\r\nsuch are FERRERS and GRESLEY, above mentioned; VARANO, Dukes de CAMERINO;\r\nVAIRE and VAIRIÈRE, in France; VERET, in Switzerland; GOUVIS, FRESNAY\r\n(Brittany); DE VERA in Spain; LOHEAC (Brittany); VARENCHON (Savoy);\r\nSOLDANIERI (Florence). _Counter vair_ is borne by LOFFREDO of Naples; by\r\nBOUCHAGE, DU PLESSIS ANGERS, and BROTIN, of France. HELLEMMES of Tournay\r\nuses: _de Contre vair, à lac otice de gueules brochante sur le tout_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Seal of Chimrad Pellifex, 1329.]\r\n\r\nMr. Woodward, in his \"Treatise on Heraldry,\" writes: \"Two curious forms of\r\nVair occasionally met with in Italian or French coats are known as\r\n_Plumeté_ and _Papelonné_.\r\n\r\nIn _Plumeté_ the field is apparently covered with feathers. _Plumeté\r\nd'argent et d'azur_ is the coat of Ceba (note that these are the tinctures\r\nof _Vair_); SOLDONIERI of Udine, _Plumeté au natural_ (but the SOLDONIERI\r\nof Florence bore: _Vairé argent and sable_ with _a bordure chequy or and\r\nazure_); TENREMONDE of Brabant: _Plumeté or and sable_. In the arms of the\r\nSCALTENIGHI of Padua, the BENZONI of Milan, the GIOLFINI, CATANEI, and\r\nNUVOLONI of Verona, each feather of the _plumeté_ is said to be charged\r\nwith an ermine spot sable.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of PAPELONNÉ is more frequently found; in it the field is\r\ncovered with what appear to be scales, the heraldic term _papelonné_ being\r\nderived from a supposed resemblance of these scales to the wings of\r\nbutterflies; for example the coat of MONTI: _Gules, papelonné argent_.\r\nDONZEL at Besançon bears: Papelonné d'or et de sable. It is worthy of note\r\nthat Donzé of Lorraine used: Gules, three bars wavy or. The FRANCONIS of\r\nLausanne are said to bear: _de Gueules papelonné d'argent_, and on _a chief\r\nof the last a rose of the first_, but the coat is otherwise blazoned:\r\n_Vaire gules and or_, &c. The coat of ARQUINVILLIERS, or HARGENVILLIERS, in\r\nPicardy, of _d'Hermine papelonné de {84} gueules_ (not being understood,\r\nthis has been blazoned \"_semé of caltraps_\"). So also the coat of CHEMILLÉ\r\nappears in French books of blazon indifferently as: _d'Or papelonné de\r\ngueules_: and _d'Or semé de chausse-trapes de gueules_. GUÉTTEVILLE DE\r\nGUÉNONVILLE is said to bear: _d'Argent semé de chausse-trapes de sable_,\r\nbut it is more probable that this is simply _d'Argent papelonné de sable_.\r\nThe BARISONI of Padua bear: _Or, a bend of scales, bendwise argent, on each\r\nscale an ermine spot sable, the bend bordered sable_. The ALBERICI of\r\nBologna bear: _Papelonné of seven rows, four of argent, three of or_; but\r\nthe ALBERGHI of the same city: _Papelonné of six rows, three of argent, as\r\nmany of gules_. The connection with _vairé_ is much clearer in the latter\r\nthan in the former. CAMBI (called FIGLIAMBUCHI), at Florence, carried:\r\n_d'Argent, papelonné de gueules_; MONTI of Florence and Sicily, and\r\nRONQUEROLLES of France the reverse.\r\n\r\nNo one who is familiar with the licence given to themselves by armorial\r\npainters and sculptors in Italy, who were often quite ignorant of the\r\nmeaning of the blazons they depicted, will doubt for a moment the statement\r\nthat Papelonné was originally a corruption from or perhaps is simply\r\nill-drawn Vair.\"\r\n\r\nPOTENT, and its less common variant COUNTER POTENT, are usually ranked in\r\nBritish heraldic works as separate furs. This has arisen from the writers\r\nbeing ignorant that in early times _Vair_ was frequently depicted in the\r\nform now known as _Potent_ (see Fig. 39, _q_). (By many heraldic writers\r\nthe ordinary _Potent_ is styled _Potent-counter-potent_. When drawn in the\r\nordinary way, _Potent_ alone suffices.) An example of _Vair_ in the form\r\nnow known as Potent is afforded by the seal of JEANNE DE FLANDRE, wife of\r\nENGUERRAND IV. (De Courcy); here the well-known arms of COURCY, _Barry of\r\nsix vair and gules_, are depicted as if the bars of vair were composed of\r\nbars of _potent_ (VRÉE, _Généalogie des Comtes de Flandre_). In a _Roll of\r\nArms of the time of Edward I._ the _Vair_ resembles _Potent_\r\n(-counter-potent), which DR. PERCEVAL erroneously terms an \"invention of\r\nlater date.\" The name and the differentiation may be, but not the fact. In\r\nthe First Nobility Roll of the year 1297, the arms of No. 8, ROBERT DE\r\nBRUIS, Baron of Brecknock, are: Barry of six, Vaire ermine and gules, and\r\nazure. Here the vair is potent; so is it also in No. 19, where the coat of\r\nINGELRAM DE GHISNES, or GYNES, is: Gules, a chief vair. The same coat is\r\nthus drawn in the Second Nobility Roll, 1299, No. 57. POTENT, like its\r\noriginal _Vair_, is always of _argent_ and _azure_, unless other tinctures\r\nare specified in the blazon. The name _Potent_ is the old English word for\r\na crutch or walking-staff. Chaucer, in his description of \"Elde\" (_i.e._\r\nold age) writes:\r\n\r\n \"So olde she was, that she ne went\r\n  A fote, but it were by potent.\"\r\n\r\n{85}\r\n\r\nAnd though a potent is a heraldic charge, and a cross potent a well-known\r\nvariety of that ordinary, \"potent\" is usually intended to indicate the fur\r\nof blue and white as in Fig. 39, _q_. It is not of frequent usage, but it\r\nundoubtedly has an accepted place in British armory, as also has\r\n\"counter-potent,\" which, following the same rules as counter-vair, results\r\nin a field as Fig. 39, _r_. The German terms for Potent and counter-potent\r\nare respectively _Sturzkrückenfeh_ and _gegensturzkrückenfeh_ German\r\nheraldry has evolved yet another variant of Potent, viz. _Verschobenes\r\nGegensturzkrückenfeh_ (_i.e._ displaced potent-counter-potent), as in Fig.\r\n39, _s_. There is still yet another German heraldic fur which is quite\r\nunknown in British armory. This is called _Kursch_, otherwise \"Vair\r\nbellies,\" and is usually shown to be hairy and represented brown. Possibly\r\nthis is the same as the _Plumeté_ to which Mr. Woodward refers.\r\n\r\nSome heraldic writers also speak of _varry_ as meaning the pieces of which\r\nthe vair is composed; they also use the terms _vairy cuppy_ and _vairy\r\ntassy_ for _potent-counter-potent_, perhaps from the drawings in some\r\ninstances resembling _cups_; that is a possible meaning of _tassa_. It may\r\nbe said that all these variations of the ancient _vair_ arise from mere\r\naccident (generally bad drawing), supplemented by over refinement on the\r\npart of the heraldic writers who have described them. This generalisation\r\nmay be extended in its application from vair to many other heraldic\r\nmatters. To all intents and purposes British heraldry now or hitherto has\r\nonly known vair and potent.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest rules one learns in the study of armory is that colour\r\ncannot be placed upon colour, nor metal upon metal. Now this is a definite\r\nrule which must practically always be rigidly observed. Many writers have\r\ngone so far as to say that the only case of an infraction of this rule will\r\nbe found in the arms of Jerusalem: Argent, a cross potent between four\r\ncrosslets or. This was a favourite windmill at which the late Dr. Woodward\r\ntilted vigorously, and in the appendix to his \"Treatise on Heraldry\" he\r\nenumerates some twenty-six instances of the violation of the rule. The\r\nwhole of the instances he quoted, however, are taken from Continental\r\narmory, in which these exceptions--for even on the Continent such _armes\r\nfausses_ are noticeable exceptions--occur much more frequently than in this\r\ncountry. Nevertheless such exceptions _do_ occur in British armory, and the\r\nfollowing instances of well-known coats which break the rule may be quoted.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Lloyd of Ffos-y-Bleiddied, co. Cardigan, and Danyrallt, co.\r\nCarmarthen, are: \"Sable, a spearhead imbrued proper between three\r\nscaling-ladders argent, on a chief _gules_ a castle of the second.\" Burke,\r\nin his \"General Armory,\" says this coat of arms was granted to Cadifor ap\r\nDyfnwal, ninth in descent from Roderick the Great, Prince of Wales, by his\r\ncousin the great Lord Rhys, for taking the castle of {86} Cardigan by\r\nescalade from the Earl of Clare and the Flemings in 1164. Another instance\r\nis a coat of Meredith recorded in Ulster's Office and now inherited by the\r\nHon. Richard Edmund Meredith, a judge of the Supreme Court of Judicature of\r\nIreland and a Judicial Commissioner of the Irish Land Commission. These\r\narms are: \"Gules, on a chevron sable, between three goats' heads erased, as\r\nmany trefoils or.\" An instance of comparatively recent date will be found\r\nin the grant of the arms of Thackeray. A little careful research, no doubt,\r\nwould produce a large number of English instances, but one is bound to\r\nadmit the possibility that the great bulk of these cases may really be\r\ninstances of augmentation.\r\n\r\nFurs may be placed upon either metal or colour, as may also any charge\r\nwhich is termed proper. German heralds describe furs and natural colours as\r\namphibious. It is perfectly legitimate to place fur upon fur, and though\r\nnot often found, numbers of examples can be quoted; probably one will\r\nsuffice. The arms of Richardson are: Sable, two hawks belled or, on a chief\r\nindented ermine, a pale ermines, and three lions' heads counterchanged. It\r\nis also correct to place ermine upon argent. But such coats are not very\r\nfrequently found, and it is usual in designing a coat to endeavour to\r\narrange that the fur shall be treated as metal or colour according to what\r\nmay be its background. The reason for this is obvious. It is correct,\r\nthough unusual, for a charge which is blazoned proper, and yet depicted in\r\na recognised heraldic colour, to be placed upon colour; and where such\r\ncases occur, care should be taken that the charges are blazoned proper. A\r\ncharge composed of more than one tincture, that is, of a metal and colour,\r\nmay be placed upon a field of either; for example the well-known coat of\r\nStewart, which is: Or, a fess chequy azure and argent; other examples\r\nbeing: Per pale ermine and azure, a fess wavy gules (Broadbent); and:\r\nAzure, a lion rampant argent, debruised by a fess per pale of the second\r\nand gules (Walsh); but in such coats it will usually be found that the\r\nfirst tincture of the composite charge should be in opposition to the field\r\nupon which it is superimposed. For instance, the arms of Stewart are: Or, a\r\nfess chequy azure and argent, and to blazon or depict them with a fess\r\nchequy argent and azure would be incorrect. When an ordinary is charged\r\nupon both metal and colour, it would be quite correct for it to be of\r\neither metal, colour, or fur, and in such cases it has never been\r\nconsidered either exceptional or an infraction of the rule that colour must\r\nnot be placed upon colour, nor metal upon metal. There is one point,\r\nhowever, which is one of these little points one has to learn from actual\r\nexperience, and which I believe has never yet been quoted in any handbook\r\nof heraldry, and that is, that this rule must be thrown overboard with\r\nregard to {87} crests and supporters. I cannot call to mind an instance of\r\ncolour upon colour, but a gold collar around the neck of an argent crest\r\nwill constantly be met with. The sinister supporter of the Royal\r\nachievement is a case in point, and this rule, which forbids colour upon\r\ncolour, and metal upon metal, only holds with regard to supporters and\r\ncrests when the crest or supporter itself is treated as a field and\r\n_charged with_ one or more objects. The Royal labels, as already stated,\r\nappear to be a standing infraction of the rule if white and argent are to\r\nbe heraldically treated as identical. The rule is also disregarded entirely\r\nas regards augmentations and Scottish cadency bordures.\r\n\r\nSo long as the field is party, that is, divided into an equal number of\r\npieces (for example, paly, barruly, or bendy, or party per bend or per\r\nchevron), it may be composed of two metals or two colours, because the\r\npieces all being equal, and of equal number, they all are parts of the\r\nfield lying in the same plane, none being charges.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of the field, one must not omit to mention\r\ncertain exceptions which hardly fall within any of the before-mentioned\r\ncategories. One of these can only be described by the word \"landscape.\" It\r\nis not uncommon in British armory, though I know of but one instance where\r\nthe actual field itself needs to be so described. This is the coat of the\r\nfamily of Franco, the paternal ancestors of Sir Massey Lopes, Bart., and\r\nLord Ludlow. The name was changed from Franco to Lopes by Royal Licence\r\ndated the 4th of May 1831. Whether this coat of arms originated in an\r\nEnglish grant, or whether the English grant of it amounts to no more than\r\nan attempt at the registration of a previously existing or greatly similar\r\nforeign coat of arms for the name of Franco, I am unaware, but the coat\r\ncertainly is blazoned: \"In a landscape field, a fountain, therefrom issuing\r\na palm-tree all proper.\"\r\n\r\nBut landscape has very extensively been made use of in the augmentations\r\nwhich were granted at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the\r\nnineteenth centuries. In these cases the augmentation very generally\r\nconsisted of a chief and thereon a representation either of some fort or\r\nship or action, and though the field of the augmentation is officially\r\nblazoned argent in nearly every case, there is no doubt the artist was\r\npermitted, and perhaps intended, to depict clouds and other \"atmosphere\" to\r\nadd to the verisimilitude of the picture. These augmentations will be more\r\nespecially considered in a later chapter, but here one may perhaps be\r\npermitted to remark, that execrable as we now consider such landscape\r\nheraldry, it ought not to be condemned in the wholesale manner in which it\r\nhas been, because it was typical of the over elaboration to be found in all\r\nart and all artistic ideas of the period in which we find it originating.\r\nHeraldry and heraldic art have {88} always been a mirror of the artistic\r\nideas prevalent at equivalent periods, and unless heraldry is to be wholly\r\nrelegated to consideration as a dead subject, it is an anachronism to\r\ndepict an action the date of which is well known (and which date it is\r\ndesired to advertise and not conceal) in a method of art belonging to a\r\ndifferent period. In family arms the case is different, as with those the\r\nidea apparently is always the concealment of the date of nobility.\r\n\r\nThe \"landscape\" variety of heraldry is more common in Germany than with us,\r\nand Ströhl writes: \"Of very little heraldic worth are the old house and\r\nhome signs as they were used by landed proprietors, tradesmen, and artisans\r\nor workmen, as indicative of their possessions, wares, or productions.\r\nThese signs, originally simply outline pictures, were later introduced into\r\nheraldic soil, inasmuch as bourgeois families raised to the nobility\r\nadopted their house signs as heraldic charges upon their shields.\"\r\n\r\nThere are also many coats of arms which run: \"In base, a representation of\r\nwater proper,\" and one of the best instances of this will be found in the\r\narms of Oxford, though for the sake of preserving the pun the coat in this\r\ncase is blazoned: \"Argent, an ox gules passing over a ford proper.\" Similar\r\ninstances occur in the arms of Renfrew, Queensferry, Leith, Ryde, and\r\nscores of other towns. It has always been considered permissible to\r\nrepresent these either by an attempt to depict natural water, or else in\r\nthe ancient heraldic way of representing water, namely \"barry wavy argent\r\nand azure.\" There are many other coats of arms which are of a similar\r\ncharacter though specifically blazoned \"barry wavy argent and azure.\" Now\r\nthis representation of water in base can hardly be properly said to be a\r\ncharge, but perhaps it might be dismissed as such were it not that one coat\r\nof arms exists in Scotland, the whole of the field of which is simply a\r\nrepresentation of water. Unfortunately this coat of arms has never been\r\nmatriculated in Lyon Register or received official sanction; but there is\r\nno doubt of its ancient usage, and were it to be now matriculated in\r\nconformity with the Act of 1672, there is very little doubt that the\r\nancient characteristic would be retained. The arms are those of the town of\r\nInveraray in Argyllshire, and the blazon of the coat, according to the form\r\nit is depicted upon the Corporate seal, would be for the field: \"The sea\r\nproper, therein a net suspended from the dexter chief and the sinister fess\r\npoints to the base; and entangled in its meshes five herrings,\" which is\r\nabout the most remarkable coat of arms I have ever come across.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a \"field,\" or portion of a field, will be found to be a\r\nrepresentation of masonry. This may be either proper or of some metal or\r\ncolour. The arms of the city of Bath are: \"Party per fesse {89} embattled\r\nazure and argent, the base masonry, in chief two bars wavy of the second;\r\nover all, a sword in pale gules, hilt and pommel or.\" The arms of Reynell\r\nare: \"Argent, masoned sable, a chief indented of the second.\"\r\n\r\nSEME\r\n\r\nThe use of the term \"semé\" must be considered before we leave the subject\r\nof the field. It simply means \"powdered with\" or \"strewed with\" any\r\nobjects, the number of the latter being unlimited, the purpose being to\r\nevenly distribute them over the shield. In depicting anything semé, care is\r\nusually taken that some of the charges (with which the field is semé) shall\r\nbe partly defaced by the edges of the shield, or the ordinary upon which\r\nthey are charged, or by the superior charge itself, to indicate that the\r\nfield is not charged with a specific number of objects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Arms of John, Lord De la Warr (d. 1398). (From MS.\r\nAshm. 804, iv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Arms of John, Lord Beaumont, K.G. (d. 1396). From\r\nhis Garter Plate: 1 and 4, Beaumont; 2 and 3, azure, three garbs or (for\r\nComyn).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Arms of Gilbert Umfraville, Earl of Kyme (d.\r\n1421). (From Harl. MS. 6163.)]\r\n\r\nThere are certain special terms which may be noted. A field or charge semé\r\nof fleurs-de-lis is termed \"semé-de-lis,\" but if semé of bezants it is\r\nbezanté, and is termed platé if semé of plates.\r\n\r\nA field semé of billets is billetty or billetté, and when semé of cross\r\ncrosslets it is termed crusilly. A field or charge semé of drops is termed\r\ngoutté or gutty.\r\n\r\nInstances of coats of which the field is semé will be found in the arms of\r\nDe la Warr (see Fig. 44), which are: Gules, crusilly, and a lion rampant\r\nargent; Beaumont (see Fig. 45): Azure, semé-de-lis and a lion rampant or;\r\nand Umfraville (see Fig. 46): Gules, semé of crosses flory, and a\r\ncinquefoil or.\r\n\r\nThe goutte or drop occasionally figures (in a specified number) as a\r\ncharge; but such cases are rare, its more frequent use being to show {90} a\r\nfield semé. British heraldry alone has evolved separate names for the\r\ndifferent colours, all other nations simply using the term \"goutté\" or\r\n\"gutté,\" and specifying the colour. The terms we have adopted are as\r\nfollows: For drops of gold, \"gutté-d'or\"; silver, \"gutté-d'eau\"; for gules,\r\n\"gutté-de-sang\"; azure, \"gutté-de-larmes\"; vert, \"gutté-d'huile\"; and\r\nsable, \"gutté-de-poix.\"\r\n\r\nThe term semé must not be confused with diapering, for whilst the objects\r\nwith which a field is semé are an integral part of the arms, diapering is a\r\npurely artistic and optional matter.\r\n\r\nDIAPERING\r\n\r\nThe diapering of armorial emblazonments is a matter with which the\r\n_Science_ of armory has no concern. Diaper never forms any part of the\r\nblazon, and is never officially noticed, being considered, and very\r\nproperly allowed to remain, a purely artistic detail. From the artistic\r\npoint of view it has some importance, as in many of the earliest instances\r\nof handicraft in which armorial decoration appears, very elaborate\r\ndiapering is introduced. The frequency with which diapering is met with in\r\narmorial handicraft is strangely at variance with its absence in heraldic\r\npaintings of the same periods, a point which may perhaps be urged upon the\r\nattention of some of the heraldic artists of the present day, who would\r\nrather seem to have failed to grasp the true purpose and origin and perhaps\r\nalso the use of diaper. In stained glass and enamel work, where the use of\r\ndiaper is most frequently met with, it was introduced for the express\r\npurpose of catching and breaking up the light, the result of which was to\r\ngive an enormously increased effect of brilliance to the large and\r\notherwise flat surfaces. These tricks of their art and craft the old\r\nhandicraftsmen were past masters in the use of. But no such purpose could\r\nbe served in a small painting upon vellum. For this reason early heraldic\r\nemblazonments are seldom if ever found to have been diapered. With the rise\r\nof heraldic engraving amongst the \"little masters\" of German art, the\r\nopportunity left to their hands by the absence of colour naturally led to\r\nthe renewed use of diaper to avoid the appearance of blanks in their work.\r\nThe use of diaper at the present day needs to be the result of careful\r\nstudy and thought, and its haphazard employment is not recommended.\r\n\r\nIf, as Woodward states (an assertion one is rather inclined to doubt),\r\nthere are some cases abroad in which the constant use of diapering has been\r\nstereotyped into an integral part of the arms, these cases must be\r\nexceedingly few in number, and they certainly have no counterpart in the\r\narmory of this country. Where for artistic reasons {91} diapering is\r\nemployed, care must always be taken that the decorative form employed\r\ncannot be mistaken for a field either charged or semé.\r\n\r\nPARTITION LINES\r\n\r\nIf there is one subject which the ordinary text-books of armory treat in\r\nthe manner of classification adapted to an essay on natural history or\r\ngrammar, with its attendant rigidity of rule, it is the subject of\r\npartition lines; and yet the whole subject is more in the nature of a set\r\nof explanations which must each be learned on its own merits. The usual\r\nlines of partition are themselves well enough known; and it is hardly\r\nnecessary to elaborate the different variations at any great length. They\r\nmay, however, be enumerated as follows: Engrailed, embattled, indented,\r\ninvecked or invected, wavy or undy, nebuly, dancetté, raguly, potenté,\r\ndovetailed, and urdy. These are the lines which are recognised by most\r\nmodern heraldic text-books and generally recapitulated; but we shall have\r\noccasion later to refer to others which are very well known, though\r\napparently they have never been included in the classification of partition\r\nlines (Fig. 47). _Engrailed_, as every one knows, is formed by a continuous\r\nand concurrent series of small semicircles conjoined each to each, the\r\nsharp points formed by the conjunction of the two arcs being placed\r\n_outwards_. This partition line may be employed for the rectilinear charges\r\nknown as \"ordinaries\" or \"sub-ordinaries.\" In the bend, pale, pile, cross,\r\nchief, and fess, when these are described as engrailed the enclosing lines\r\nof the ordinary, other than the edges of the shield, are all composed of\r\nthese small semicircles with the points turned _outwards_, and the word\r\n\"outwards\" must be construed as pointing away from the centre of the\r\nordinary when it is depicted. In the case of a chief the points are turned\r\ndownwards, but it is rather difficult to describe the use of the term when\r\nused as a partition line of the field. The only instance I can call to mind\r\nwhere it is so employed is the case of Baird of Ury, the arms of this\r\nfamily being: Per pale engrailed gules and or, a boar passant\r\ncounterchanged. In this instance the points are turned towards the sinister\r\nside of the shield, which would seem to be correct, as, there being no\r\nordinary, they must be outwards from the most important position affected,\r\nwhich in this case undoubtedly is the dexter side of the shield. In the\r\nsame way \"per fess engrailed\" would be presumably depicted with the points\r\noutwards from the chief line of the shield, that is, they would point\r\ndownwards; and I should imagine that in \"per bend engrailed\" the points of\r\nthe semicircles would again be placed inclined towards the dexter base of\r\nthe shield, but I may be wrong in these two latter cases, for they are only\r\nsupposition. This {92} point, however, which puzzled me much in depicting\r\nthe arms of Baird of Ury, I could find explained in no text-book upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Lines of Partition.]\r\n\r\nThe term _invected_ or _invecked_ is the precise opposite of engrailed. It\r\nis similarly composed of small semicircles, but the points are turned\r\ninwards instead of outwards, so that it is no more than the exact reverse\r\nof engrailed, and all the regulations concerning the one need to be\r\nobserved concerning the other, with the proviso that they are reversed.\r\n{93}\r\n\r\nThe partition line _embattled_ has certain peculiarities of its own. When\r\ndividing the field there can be no difficulty about it, inasmuch as the\r\ncrenellations are equally inwards and outwards from any point, and it\r\nshould be noted that the term \"crenellé\" is almost as often used as\r\n\"embattled.\" When, however, the term describes an ordinary, certain points\r\nhave to be borne in mind. The fess or the bar embattled is drawn with the\r\ncrenellations _on the upper side_ only, the under edge being plain unless\r\nthe ordinary is described both as \"embattled and counter-embattled.\"\r\nSimilarly a chevron is only crenellated on the upper edge unless it is\r\ndescribed as both embattled and counter-embattled, but a pale embattled is\r\ncrenellated on both edges as is the cross or saltire. Strictly speaking, a\r\nbend embattled is crenellated upon the upper edge only, though with regard\r\nto this ordinary there is much laxity of practice. I have never come across\r\na pile embattled; but it would naturally be embattled on both edges. Some\r\nwriters make a distinction between embattled and bretessed, giving to the\r\nformer term the meaning that the embattlements on the one side are opposed\r\nto the indentations on the other, and using the term bretessed to signify\r\nthat embattlements are opposite embattlements and indentations opposite\r\nindentations. I am doubtful as to the accuracy of this distinction, because\r\nthe French term bretessé means only counter-embattled.\r\n\r\nThe terms _indented_ and _dancetté_ need to be considered together, because\r\nthey differ very little, and only in the fact that whilst indented may be\r\ndrawn with any number of teeth, dancetté is drawn with a limited number,\r\nwhich is usually three complete teeth in the width of the field. But it\r\nshould be observed that this rule is not so hard and fast that the\r\nnecessity of artistic depicting may not modify it slightly. An ordinary\r\nwhich is indented would follow much the same rules as an ordinary which was\r\nengrailed, except that the teeth are made by small straight lines for the\r\nindentations instead of by small semicircles, and instances can doubtless\r\nbe found of all the ordinaries qualified by the term indented. Dancetté,\r\nhowever, does not lend itself so readily to general application, and is\r\nusually to be found applied to either a fess or chief, or occasionally a\r\nbend. In the case of a fess dancetté the indentations on the top and bottom\r\nlines are made to fit into each other, so that instead of having a straight\r\nband with the edge merely toothed, one gets an up and down zig-zag band\r\nwith three complete teeth at the top and three complete teeth at the\r\nbottom. Whilst a fess, a bar, a bend, and a chief can be found dancetté, I\r\ndo not see how it would be possible to draw a saltire or a cross dancetté.\r\nAt any rate the resulting figure would be most ugly, and would appear\r\nill-balanced. A pile and a chevron seem equally impossible, though there\r\ndoes not {94} seem to be the like objection to a pale dancetté. An instance\r\nof a bend dancetté is found in the arms of Cuffe (Lord Desart), which are:\r\nArgent, on a bend dancetté sable, plain cotised azure, three fleurs-de-lis,\r\nand on each cotise as many bezants.\r\n\r\n_Wavy_ or _undy_, which is supposed to have been taken from water, and\r\n_nebuly_, which is supposed to be derived from clouds, are of course lines\r\nwhich are well known. They are equally applicable to any ordinary and to\r\nany partition of the field; but in both cases it should be noticed by\r\nartists that there is no one definite or accepted method of depicting these\r\nlines, and one is quite at liberty, and might be recommended, to widen out\r\nthe indentations, or to increase them in height, as the artistic\r\nrequirements of the work in hand may seem to render advisable. It is only\r\nby bearing this in mind and treating these lines with freedom that really\r\nartistic work can sometimes be produced where they occur. There is no fixed\r\nrule either as to the width which these lines may occupy or as to the\r\nnumber of indentations as compared with the width of the shield, and it is\r\na pity to introduce or recognise any regulations of this character where\r\nnone exist. There are writers who think it not unlikely that vairé and\r\nbarry nebuly were one and the same thing. It is at any rate difficult in\r\nsome old representations to draw any noticeable distinctions between the\r\nmethods of depicting barry nebuly and vair.\r\n\r\nThe line _raguly_ has been the subject of much discussion. It, and the two\r\nwhich follow, viz. potenté and dovetailed, are all comparatively modern\r\nintroductions. It would be interesting if some enthusiast would go\r\ncarefully through the ancient Rolls of Arms and find the earliest\r\noccurrences of these terms. My own impression is that they would all be\r\nfound to be inventions of the mediæval writers on heraldry. Raguly is the\r\nsame as embattled, with the crenellations put upon the slant. Some writers\r\nsay they should slant one way, others give them slanting the reverse. In a\r\npale or a bend the teeth must point upwards; but in a fess I should\r\nhesitate to say whether it were more correct for them to point to the\r\ndexter or to the sinister, and I am inclined to consider that either is\r\nperfectly correct. At any rate, whilst they are usually drawn inclined to\r\nthe dexter, in Woodward and Burnett they are to the sinister, and Guillim\r\ngives them turned to the dexter, saying, \"This form of line I never yet met\r\nwith in use as a partition, though frequently in composing of ordinaries\r\nreferring them like to the trunks of trees with the branches lopped off,\r\nand that (as I take it) it was intended to represent.\" Modern heraldry\r\nsupplies an instance which in the days of Mr. Guillim, of course, did not\r\nexist to refer to. This instance occurs in the arms of the late Lord\r\nLeighton, which were: \"Quarterly per fesse raguly or and gules, in the\r\nsecond and {95} third quarters a wyvern of the first.\" It is curious that\r\nGuillim, even in the edition of 1724, does not mention any of the remaining\r\nterms. Dovetailed in modern armory is even yet but seldom made use of,\r\nthough I can quote two instances of coats of arms in which it is to be\r\nfound, namely, the arms of Kirk, which are: \"Gules, a chevron dovetailed\r\nermine, on a chief argent, three dragons' heads couped of the field;\" and\r\nAmbrose: \"Azure, two lions passant in pale argent, on a chief dovetailed of\r\nthe last, a fleur-de-lis between two annulets of the first.\" Other\r\ninstances of dovetailed used as a line of partition will be found in the\r\ncase of the arms of Farmer, which are: \"Per chevron dovetailed gules and\r\nargent, in chief two lions' heads erased of the last, and in base a\r\nsalamander in flames proper;\" and in the arms of Fenton namely: \"Per pale\r\nargent and sable, a cross dovetailed, in the first and fourth quarters a\r\nfleur-de-lis, and in the second and third a trefoil slipped all\r\ncountercharged.\" There are, of course, many others. The term _potenté_, as\r\nwill be seen from a reference to Fig. 47, is used to indicate a line which\r\nfollows the form of the division lines in the fur potent. As one of the\r\npartition lines potenté is very rare.\r\n\r\nAs to the term _urdy_, which is given in Woodward and Burnett and also in\r\nBerry, I can only say I personally have never come across an instance of\r\nits use as a partition line. A cross or a billet urdy one knows, but urdy\r\nas a partition line I have yet to find. It is significant that it is\r\nomitted in Parker except as a term applicable to a cross, and the instances\r\nand variations given by Berry, \"urdy in point paleways\" and \"contrary\r\nurdy,\" I should be much more inclined to consider as variations of vair;\r\nand, though it is always well to settle points which can be settled, I\r\nthink urdy and its use as a partition line may be well left for further\r\nconsideration when examples of it come to hand.\r\n\r\nThere is one term, however, which is to be met with at the present time,\r\nbut which I have never seen quoted in any text-book under the heading of a\r\npartition line; that is, \"flory counter-flory,\" which is of course formed\r\nby a succession of fleurs-de-lis alternately reversed and counterchanged.\r\nThey might of course be blazoned after the quotation of the field as \"per\r\nbend\" or \"per chevron\" as the case might be, simply as so many\r\nfleurs-de-lis counterchanged, and alternately reversed in a specified\r\nposition; but this never appears to be the case, and consequently the\r\nfleurs-de-lis would appear to be essentially parts of the field and not\r\ncharges. I have sometimes thought whether it would not be more correct to\r\ndepict \"per something\" flory and counter-flory without completing the\r\nfleurs-de-lis, simply leaving the alternate tops of the fleurs-de-lis to\r\nshow. In the cases of the illustrations which have come under my notice,\r\nhowever, the whole fleur-de-lis is depicted, and as an instance of the use\r\nof the term may be mentioned the arms of {96} Dumas, which are: \"Per\r\nchevron flory and counter-flory or and azure, in chief two lions' gambs\r\nerased, and in base a garb counterchanged.\" But when the term flory and\r\ncounter-flory is used in conjunction with an ordinary, _e.g._ a fess flory\r\nand counter-flory, the _half_ fleurs-de-lis, only alternately reversed, are\r\nrepresented on the _outer_ edges of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nI think also that the word \"_arched_\" should now be included as a partition\r\nline. I confess that the only form in which I know of it is that it is\r\nfrequently used by the present Garter King of Arms in designing coats of\r\narms with chiefs arched. Recently Garter has granted a coat with a chief\r\ndouble arched. But if a chief can be arched I see no reason why a fesse or\r\na bar cannot equally be so altered, and in that case it undoubtedly becomes\r\na recognised line of partition. Perhaps it should be stated that a chief\r\narched is a chief with its base line one arc of a large circle. The\r\ndiameter of the circle and the consequent acuteness of the arch do not\r\nappear to be fixed by any definite rule, and here again artistic\r\nrequirements must be the controlling factor in any decision. Elvin in his\r\n\"Dictionary of Heraldic Terms\" gives a curious assortment of lines, the\r\nmost curious of all, perhaps, being indented embowed, or hacked and hewed.\r\nWhere such a term originated or in what coat of arms it is to be found I am\r\nignorant, but the appearance is exactly what would be presented by a piece\r\nof wood hacked with an axe at regular intervals. Elvin again makes a\r\ndifference between bretessed and embattled-counter-embattled, making the\r\nembattlement on either side of an ordinary identical in the former and\r\nalternated in the latter. He also makes a difference between raguly, which\r\nis the conventional form universally adopted, and raguled and trunked,\r\nwhere the ordinary takes the representation of the trunk of a tree with the\r\nbranches lopped; but these and many others that he gives are refinements of\r\nidea which personally I should never expect to find in actual use, and of\r\nthe instances of which I am unaware. I think, however, the term\r\n\"_rayonné_,\" which is found in both the arms of O'Hara and the arms of\r\nColman, and which is formed by the addition of rays to the ordinary, should\r\ntake a place amongst lines of partition, though I admit I know of no\r\ninstance in which it is employed to divide the field.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF PARTITION\r\n\r\nThe field of any coat of arms is the surface colour of the shield, and is\r\nsupposed to include the area within the limits formed by its outline. There\r\nare, as has been already stated, but few coats of a single colour minus a\r\ncharge to be found in British heraldry. But there {97} are many which\r\nconsist of a field divided by partition lines only, of which some instances\r\nwere given on page 69.\r\n\r\nA shield may be divided by partition lines running in the direction of\r\nalmost any \"ordinary,\" in which case the field will be described as \"per\r\nbend\" or \"per chevron,\" &c. It may be:\r\n\r\n  Per fess                             Fig. 48\r\n  Per bend                              \"   49\r\n  Per bend sinister                     \"   50\r\n  Per pale                              \"   51\r\n  Per chevron                           \"   52\r\n  Per cross                             \"   53\r\n  (though it should be noted that the more usual term employed\r\n  for this is \"quarterly\")\r\n  Per saltire                          Fig. 54\r\n\r\nBut a field cannot be \"per pile\" or \"per chief,\" because there is no other\r\nway of representing these ordinaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Per fess.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Per bend.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Per bend sinister.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Per pale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Per chevron.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Per cross or quarterly.]\r\n\r\nA field can be composed of any number of pieces in the form of the\r\nordinaries filling the area of the shield, in which case the field is said\r\nto be \"barry\" (Figs. 55 and 56), \"paly\" (Fig. 57), \"bendy\" (Fig. 58),\r\n\"chevronny\" (Fig. 59), &c., but the number of pieces must be specified.\r\n{98}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Per saltire.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Barry.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Barry nebuly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Paly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Bendy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Chevronny.]\r\n\r\nAnother method of partition will be found in the fields \"checky\" (or\r\n\"chequy\") and lozengy; but these divisions, as also the foregoing, will be\r\ntreated more specifically under the different ordinaries. A field which is\r\nparty need not necessarily have all its lines of partition the same. This\r\npeculiarity, however, seldom occurs except in the case of a field\r\nquarterly, the object in coats of this character being to prevent different\r\nquarters of one coat of arms being ranked as or taken to be quarterings\r\nrepresenting different families. {99}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE RULES OF BLAZON\r\n\r\nThe word \"Blazon\" is used with some number of meanings, but practically it\r\nmay be confined to the verb \"to blazon,\" which is to describe in words a\r\ngiven coat of arms, and the noun \"blazon,\" which is such a description.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to differentiate between the employment of the term\r\n\"blazon\" and the verb \"to emblazon,\" which latter means to depict in\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nIt may here be remarked, however, that to illustrate by the use of outline\r\nwith written indications of colour is termed \"to trick,\" and a picture of\r\narms of this character is termed \"a trick.\"\r\n\r\nThe term _trick_ has of late been extended (though one almost thinks\r\nimproperly) to include representations of arms in which the colours are\r\nindicated by the specified tincture lines which have been already referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThe subject of blazon has of late acquired rather more importance than has\r\nhitherto been conceded to it, owing to an unofficial attempt to introduce a\r\nnew system of blazoning under the guise of a supposed reversion to earlier\r\nforms of description. This it is not, but even if it were what it claims to\r\nbe, merely the revival of ancient forms and methods, its reintroduction\r\ncannot be said to be either expedient or permissible, because the ancient\r\npractice does not permit of extension to the limits within which more\r\nmodern armory has developed, and modern armory, though less ancient, is\r\narmory equally with the more ancient and simpler examples to be found in\r\nearlier times. To ignore modern armory is simply futile and absurd.\r\n\r\nThe rules to be employed in blazon are simple, and comparatively few in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of any blazon is of necessity a description of the\r\n_field_, the one word signifying its colour being employed if it be a\r\nsimple field; or, if it be composite, such terms as are necessary. Thus, a\r\ncoat divided \"per pale\" or \"per chevron\" is so described, and whilst the\r\nScottish field of this character is officially termed \"Parted\" [per pale,\r\nor per chevron], the English equivalent is \"Party,\" though this {100} word\r\nin English usage is more often omitted than not in the blazon which\r\ncommences \"per pale,\" or \"per chevron,\" as the case may be.\r\n\r\nThe description of the different colours and different divisions of the\r\nfield have all been detailed in earlier chapters, but it may be added that\r\nin a \"party\" coloured field, that colour or tincture is mentioned first\r\nwhich occupies the more important part of the escutcheon. Thus, in a field\r\n\"per bend,\" \"per chevron,\" or \"per fess,\" the upper portion of the field is\r\nfirst referred to; in a coat \"per pale,\" the dexter side is the more\r\nimportant; and in a coat \"quarterly,\" the tinctures of the 1st and 4th\r\nquarters are given precedence of the tinctures of the 2nd and 3rd. The only\r\ndivision upon which there has seemed any uncertainty is the curious one\r\n\"gyronny,\" but the correct method to be employed in this case can very\r\neasily be recognised by taking the first quarter of the field, and therein\r\nconsidering the field as if it were simply \"per bend.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the field has been described, anything of which the field is semé\r\nmust next be alluded to, _e.g._ gules, semé-de-lis or, &c.\r\n\r\nThe second thing to be mentioned in the blazon is the principal charge. We\r\nwill consider first those cases in which it is an ordinary. Thus, one would\r\nspeak of \"Or, a chevron gules,\" or, if there be other charges as well as\r\nthe ordinary, \"Azure, a bend between two horses' heads or,\" or \"Gules, a\r\nchevron between three roses argent.\"\r\n\r\nThe colour of the ordinary is not mentioned until after the charge, if it\r\nbe the same as the latter, but if it be otherwise it must of course be\r\nspecified, as in the coat: \"Or, a fess gules between three crescents\r\nsable.\" If the ordinary is charged, the charges thereupon, being less\r\nimportant than the charges in the field, are mentioned subsequently, as in\r\nthe coat: \"Gules, on a bend argent between two fountains proper, a rose\r\ngules between two mullets sable.\"\r\n\r\nThe position of the charges need not be specified when they would naturally\r\nfall into a certain position with regard to the ordinaries. Thus, a chevron\r\nbetween three figures of necessity has two in chief and one in base. A bend\r\nbetween two figures of necessity has one above and one below. A fess has\r\ntwo above and one below. A cross between four has one in each angle. In\r\nnone of these cases is it necessary to state the position. If, however,\r\nthose positions or numbers do not come within the category mentioned, care\r\nmust be taken to specify what the coat exactly is.\r\n\r\nIf a bend is accompanied only by one charge, the position of this charge\r\nmust be stated. For example: \"Gules, a bend or, in chief a crescent\r\nargent.\" A chevron with four figures would be described: \"Argent, a chevron\r\nbetween three escallops in chief and one in base sable,\" though it would be\r\nequally correct to say: \"Argent, a chevron {101} between four escallops,\r\nthree in chief and one in base sable.\" In the same way we should get:\r\n\"Vert, on a cross or, and in the 1st quarter a bezant, an estoile sable;\"\r\nthough, to avoid confusion, this coat would more probably be blazoned:\r\n\"Vert, a cross or, charged with an estoile sable, and in the first quarter\r\na bezant.\" This example will indicate the latitude which is permissible if,\r\nfor the sake of avoiding confusion and making a blazon more readily\r\nunderstandable, some deviation from the strict formulas would appear to be\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nIf there be no ordinary on a shield, the charge which occupies the chief\r\nposition is mentioned first. For example: \"Or, a lion rampant sable between\r\nthree boars' heads erased gules, two in chief and one in base.\" Many\r\npeople, however, would omit any reference to the position of the boars'\r\nheads, taking it for granted that, as there were only three, they would be\r\n2 and 1, which is the normal position of three charges in any coat of arms.\r\nIf, however, the coat of arms had the three boars' heads all above the\r\nlion, it would then be necessary to blazon it: \"Or, a lion rampant sable,\r\nin chief three boars' heads erased gules.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a field is _semé_ of anything, this is taken to be a part of the\r\nfield, and not a representation of a number of charges. Consequently the\r\narms of Long are blazoned: \"Sable, semé of cross crosslets, a lion rampant\r\nargent.\" As a matter of fact the semé of cross crosslets is always termed\r\n_crusilly_, as has been already explained.\r\n\r\nWhen charges are placed around the shield in the position they would occupy\r\nif placed upon a bordure, these charges are said to be \"in orle,\" as in the\r\narms of Hutchinson: \"Quarterly, azure and gules, a lion rampant erminois,\r\nwithin four cross crosslets argent, and as many bezants alternately in\r\norle;\" though it is equally permissible to term charges in such a position\r\n\"an orle of [_e.g._ cross crosslets argent and bezants alternately],\" or so\r\nmany charges \"in orle\" (see Fig. 60).\r\n\r\nIf an ordinary be engrailed, or invected, this fact is at once stated, the\r\nterm occurring before the colour of the ordinary. Thus: \"Argent, on a\r\nchevron nebuly between three crescents gules, as many roses of the field.\"\r\nWhen a charge upon an ordinary is the same colour as the field, the name of\r\nthe colour is not repeated, but those charges are said to be \"of the\r\nfield.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the constant endeavour, under the recognised system, to avoid the use\r\nof the name of the same colour a second time in the blazon. Thus:\r\n\"Quarterly, gules and or, a cross counterchanged between in the first\r\nquarter a sword erect proper, pommel and hilt of the second; in the second\r\nquarter a rose of the first, barbed and seeded of the third; in the third\r\nquarter a fleur-de-lis azure; and {102} in the fourth quarter a mullet\r\n_gold_\"--the use of the term \"gold\" being alone permissible in such a case.\r\n\r\nAny animal which needs to be described, also needs its position to be\r\nspecified. It may be rampant, segreant, passant, statant, or trippant, as\r\nthe case may be. It may also sometimes be necessary to specify its position\r\nupon the shield, but the terms peculiarly appropriated to specific animals\r\nwill be given in the chapters in which these animals are dealt with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Arms of Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke:\r\n\"Baruly argent and azure, an orle of martlets gules.\" (From his seal.)]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the chief, the quarter, the canton, the flaunch, and\r\nthe bordure, an ordinary or sub-ordinary is always of greater importance,\r\nand therefore should be mentioned before any other charge, but in the cases\r\nalluded to the remainder of the shield is first blazoned, before attention\r\nis paid to these figures. Thus we should get: \"Argent, a chevron between\r\nthree mullets gules, on a chief of the last three crescents of the second;\"\r\nor \"Sable, a lion rampant between three fleurs-de-lis or, on a canton\r\nargent a mascle of the field;\" or \"Gules, two chevronels between three\r\nmullets pierced or, within a bordure engrailed argent charged with eight\r\nroses of the field.\" The arms in Fig. 61 are an interesting example of this\r\npoint. They are those of John de Bretagne, Earl of Richmond (d. 1334), and\r\nwould properly be blazoned: \"Chequy or and azure, a bordure gules, charged\r\nwith lions passant guardant or ('a bordure of England'), over all a canton\r\n(sometimes a quarter) ermine.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--The arms of John de Bretagne, Earl of Richmond.]\r\n\r\nIf two ordinaries or sub-ordinaries appear in the same field, certain\r\ndiscretion needs to be exercised, but the arms of Fitzwalter, for example,\r\nare as follows: \"Or, a fess between two chevrons gules.\"\r\n\r\nWhen charges are placed in a series following the direction of any ordinary\r\nthey are said to be \"in bend,\" \"in chevron,\" or \"in pale,\" as the case may\r\nbe, and not only must their position on the shield as regards each other be\r\nspecified, but their individual direction must also be noted.\r\n\r\nA coat of arms in which three spears were placed side by side, but each\r\nerect, would be blazoned: \"Gules, three tilting-spears palewise in fess;\"\r\nbut if the spears were placed horizontally, one above the other, they would\r\nbe blazoned: \"Three tilting-spears fesswise in pale,\" {103} because in the\r\nlatter case each spear is placed fesswise, but the three occupy in relation\r\nto each other the position of a pale. Three tilting-spears fesswise which\r\nwere not _in pale_ would be depicted 2 and 1.\r\n\r\nWhen one charge surmounts another, the undermost one is mentioned first, as\r\nin the arms of Beaumont (see Fig. 62). Here the lion rampant is the\r\nprincipal charge, and the bend which debruises it is consequently mentioned\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nIn the cases of a cross and of a saltire, the charges when all are alike\r\nwould simply be described as between four objects, though the term\r\n\"cantonned by\" four objects is sometimes met with. If the objects are not\r\nthe same, they must be specified as being in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd quarters,\r\nif the ordinary be a cross. If it be a saltire, it will be found that in\r\nScotland the charges are mentioned as being in chief and base, and in the\r\n\"flanks.\" In England they would be described as being _in pale_ and _in\r\nfess_ if the alternative charges are the same; if not, they would be\r\ndescribed as _in chief_, on the dexter side, on the sinister side, and _in\r\nbase_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--Arms of John de Beaumont, Lord Beaumont (d. 1369):\r\nAzure, semé-de-lis and a lion rampant or, over all a bend gobony argent and\r\ngules. (From his seal.)]\r\n\r\nWhen a specified number of charges is immediately followed by the same\r\nnumber of charges elsewhere disposed, the number is not repeated, the words\r\n\"as many\" being substituted instead. Thus: \"Argent, on a chevron between\r\nthree roses gules, as many crescents of the field.\" When any charge,\r\nordinary, or mark of cadency surmounts a single object, that object is\r\ntermed \"debruised\" by that ordinary. If it surmounts _everything_, as, for\r\ninstance, \"a bendlet sinister,\" this would be termed \"over all.\" When a\r\ncoat of arms is \"party\" coloured in its field and the charges are\r\nalternately of the same colours transposed, the term _counterchanged_ is\r\nused. For example, \"Party per pale argent and sable, three chevronels\r\nbetween as many mullets pierced all counterchanged.\" In that case the coat\r\nis divided down the middle, the dexter field being argent, and the sinister\r\nsable; the charges on the sable being argent, whilst the charges on the\r\nargent are sable. A mark of cadency is mentioned last, and is termed \"for\r\ndifference\"; a mark of bastardy, or a mark denoting lack of blood descent,\r\nis termed \"for distinction.\"\r\n\r\nCertain practical hints, which, however, can hardly be termed rules, were\r\nsuggested by the late Mr. J. Gough Nicholls in 1863, when writing in the\r\n_Herald and Genealogist_, and subsequent practice has since conformed\r\ntherewith, though it may be pointed out with advantage that these\r\nsuggestions are practically, and to all intents and purposes, {104} the\r\nsame rules which have been observed officially over a long period. Amongst\r\nthese suggestions he advises that the blazoning of every coat or quarter\r\nshould begin with a capital letter, and that, save on the occurrence of\r\nproper names, no other capitals should be employed. He also suggests that\r\npunctuation marks should be avoided as much as possible, his own practice\r\nbeing to limit the use of the comma to its occurrence after each tincture.\r\nHe suggests also that figures should be omitted in all cases except in the\r\nnumbering of quarterings.\r\n\r\nWhen one or more quarterings occur, each is treated separately on its own\r\nmerits and blazoned entirely without reference to any other quartering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--A to B, the chief; C to D, the base; A to C,\r\ndexter side; B to D, sinister side. A, dexter chief; B, sinister chief; C,\r\ndexter base; D, sinister base. 1, 2, 3, chief; 7, 8, 9, base; 2, 5, 8,\r\npale; 4, 5, 6, fess; 5, fess point.]\r\n\r\nIn blazoning a coat in which some quarterings (grand quarterings) are\r\ncomposed of several coats placed sub-quarterly, sufficient distinction is\r\nafforded for English purposes of writing or printing if Roman numerals are\r\nemployed to indicate the grand quarters, and Arabic figures the\r\nsub-quarters. But in _speaking_ such a method would need to be somewhat\r\nmodified in accordance with the Scottish practice, which describes grand\r\nquarterings as such, and so alludes to them.\r\n\r\nThe extensive use of bordures, charged and uncharged, in Scotland, which\r\nfigure sometimes round the sub-quarters, sometimes round the grand\r\nquarters, and sometimes round the entire escutcheon, causes so much\r\nconfusion that for the purposes of blazoning it is essential that the\r\ndifference between quarters and grand quarters should be clearly defined.\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify the blazoning of a shield, and so express the position\r\nof the charges, the _field_ has been divided into _points_, of which those\r\nplaced near the top, and to the dexter, are always considered the more\r\nimportant. In heraldry, dexter and sinister are determined, not from the\r\npoint of view of the onlooker, but from that of the bearer of the shield.\r\nThe diagram (Fig. 63) will serve to explain the plan of a shield's surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.]\r\n\r\nIf a second shield be placed upon the fess point, this is called an\r\ninescutcheon (in German, the \"heart-shield\"). The enriching of the shield\r\nwith an inescutcheon came into lively use in Germany in the course of the\r\nlatter half of the fifteenth century. Later on, further points of honour\r\nwere added, as the honour point (a, Fig. 64), and the nombril point (b,\r\nFig. 64). These extra shields laid upon the others should correspond as\r\nmuch as possible in shape to the chief shield. If between the inescutcheon\r\nand the chief shield still another be inserted, {105} it is called the\r\n\"middle shield,\" from its position, but except in Anglicised versions of\r\nContinental arms, these distinctions are quite foreign to British armory.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be stated that although the foregoing are the rules\r\nwhich are usually observed, and that every effort should be made to avoid\r\nunnecessary tautology, and to make the blazon as brief as possible, it is\r\nby no manner of means considered officially, or unofficially, that any one\r\nof these rules is so unchangeable that in actual practice it cannot be\r\nmodified if it should seem advisable so to do. For the essential necessity\r\nof accuracy is of far greater importance than any desire to be brief, or to\r\navoid tautology. This should be borne in mind, and also the fact that in\r\nofficial practice no such hide-bound character is given to these rules, as\r\none is led to believe is the case when perusing some of the ordinary\r\ntext-books of armory. They certainly are not laws, they are hardly \"rules,\"\r\nperhaps being better described as accepted methods of blazoning. {106}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE SO-CALLED ORDINARIES AND SUB-ORDINARIES\r\n\r\nArms, and the charges upon arms, have been divided into many fantastical\r\ndivisions. There is a type of the precise mind much evident in the\r\nscientific writing of the last and the preceding centuries which is for\r\never unhappy unless it can be dividing the object of its consideration into\r\nclasses and divisions, into sub-classes and sub-divisions. Heraldry has\r\nsuffered in this way; for, oblivious of the fact that the rules enunciated\r\nare impossible as rigid guides for general observance, and that they never\r\nhave been complied with, and that they never will be, a \"tabular\" system\r\nhas been evolved for heraldry as for most other sciences. The \"precise\"\r\nmind has applied a system obviously derived from natural history\r\nclassification to the principles of armory. It has selected a certain\r\nnumber of charges, and has been pleased to term them ordinaries. It has\r\nselected others which it has been pleased to term sub-ordinaries. The\r\nselection has been purely arbitrary, at the pleasure of the writer, and few\r\nwriters have agreed in their classifications. One of the foremost rules\r\nwhich former heraldic writers have laid down is that an ordinary must\r\ncontain the third part of the field. Now it is doubtful whether an ordinary\r\nhas ever been drawn containing the third part of the field by rigid\r\nmeasurement, except in the solitary instance of the pale, when it is drawn\r\n\"per fess counterchanged,\" for the obvious _purpose_ of dividing the shield\r\ninto six equal portions, a practice which has been lately pursued very\r\nextensively owing to the ease with which, by its adoption, a new coat of\r\narms can be designed bearing a distinct resemblance to one formerly in use\r\nwithout infringing the rights of the latter. Certainly, if the ordinary is\r\nthe solitary charge upon the shield, it will be drawn about that specified\r\nproportion. But when an attempt is made to draw the Walpole coat (which\r\ncannot be said to be a modern one) so that it shall exhibit three\r\nordinaries, to wit, one fess and two chevrons (which being interpreted as\r\nthree-thirds of the shield, would fill it entirely), and yet leave a goodly\r\nproportion of the field still visible, the absurdity is apparent. And a\r\nvery large proportion of the classification and rules which occupy such a\r\nlarge proportion of the space in the majority of heraldic text-books are\r\nequally unnecessary, {107} confusing, and incorrect, and what is very much\r\nmore important, such rules have never been recognised by the powers that\r\nhave had the control of armory from the beginning of that control down to\r\nthe present day. I shall not be surprised to find that many of my critics,\r\nbearing in mind how strenuously I have pleaded elsewhere for a right and\r\nproper observance of the laws of armory, may think that the foregoing has\r\nlargely the nature of a recantation. It is nothing of the kind, and I\r\nadvocate as strenuously as I have ever done, the compliance with and the\r\nobservance of every rule which can be shown to exist. But this is no\r\nargument whatever for the idle invention of rules which never have existed;\r\nor for the recognition of rules which have no other origin than the\r\nimagination of heraldic writers. Nor is it an argument for the deduction of\r\nunnecessary regulations from cases which can be shown to have been\r\nexceptions. Too little recognition is paid to the fact that in armory there\r\nare almost as many rules of exception as original rules. There are vastly\r\nmore plain exceptions to the rules which should govern them.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of ordinaries, I cannot see wherein lies the difference\r\nbetween a bend and a lion rampant, save their difference in form, yet the\r\none is said to be an ordinary, the other is merely a charge. Each has its\r\nspecial rules to be observed, and whilst a bend can be engrailed or\r\ninvected, a lion can be guardant or regardant; and whilst the one can be\r\nplaced between two objects, which objects will occupy a specified position,\r\nso can the other. Each can be charged, and each furnishes an excellent\r\nexample of the futility of some of the ancient rules which have been coined\r\nconcerning them. The ancient rules allow of but one lion and one bend upon\r\na shield, requiring that two bends shall become bendlets, and two lions\r\nlioncels, whereas the instance we have already quoted--the coat of\r\nWalpole--has never been drawn in such form that either of the chevrons\r\ncould have been considered chevronels, and it is rather late in the day to\r\ndegrade the lions of England into unblooded whelps. To my mind the\r\nordinaries and sub-ordinaries are no more than first charges, and though\r\nthe bend, the fess, the pale, the pile, the chevron, the cross, and the\r\nsaltire will always be found described as honourable ordinaries, whilst the\r\nchief seems also to be pretty universally considered as one of the\r\nhonourable ordinaries, such hopeless confusion remains as to the others\r\n(scarcely any two writers giving similar classifications), that the utter\r\nabsurdity of the necessity for any classification at all is amply\r\ndemonstrated. Classification is only necessary or desirable when a certain\r\nset of rules can be applied identically to all the set of figures in that\r\nparticular class. Even this will not hold with the ordinaries which have\r\nbeen quoted. {108}\r\n\r\nA pale embattled is embattled upon both its edges; a fess embattled is\r\nembattled only upon the upper edge; a chief is embattled necessarily only\r\nupon the lower; and the grave difficulty of distinguishing \"per pale\r\nengrailed\" from \"per pale invected\" shows that no rigid rules can be laid\r\ndown. When we come to sub-ordinaries, the confusion is still more apparent,\r\nfor as far as I can see the only reason for the classification is the\r\ntabulating of rules concerning the lines of partition. The bordure and the\r\norle can be, and often are, engrailed or embattled; the fret, the lozenge,\r\nthe fusil, the mascle, the rustre, the flanche, the roundel, the billet,\r\nthe label, the pairle, it would be practically impossible to meddle with;\r\nand all these figures have at some time or another, and by some writer or\r\nother, been included amongst either the ordinaries or the sub-ordinaries.\r\nIn fact there is no one quality which these charges possess in common which\r\nis not equally possessed by scores of other well-known charges, and there\r\nis no particular reason why a certain set should be selected and dignified\r\nby the name of ordinaries; nor are there any rules relating to ordinaries\r\nwhich require the selection of a certain number of figures, or of any\r\nfigures to be controlled by those rules, with one exception. The exception\r\nis to be found not in the rules governing the ordinaries, but in the rules\r\nof blazon. After the field has been specified, the principal charge must be\r\nmentioned first, and no charge can take precedence of a bend, fess, pale,\r\npile, chevron, cross, or saltire, except one of themselves. If there be any\r\nreason for a subdivision those charges must stand by themselves, and might\r\nbe termed the honourable ordinaries, but I can see no reason for treating\r\nthe chief, the quarter, the canton, gyron, flanche, label, orle, tressure,\r\nfret, inescutcheon, chaplet, bordure, lozenge, fusil, mascle, rustre,\r\nroundel, billet, label, shakefork, and pairle, as other than ordinary\r\ncharges. They certainly are purely heraldic, and each has its own special\r\nrules, but so in heraldry have the lion, griffin, and deer. Here is the\r\ncomplete list of the so-called ordinaries and sub-ordinaries: The bend;\r\nfess; bar; chief; pale; chevron; cross; saltire; pile; pairle, shakefork or\r\npall; quarter; canton; gyron; bordure; orle; tressure; flanche; label,\r\nfret; inescutcheon; chaplet; lozenge; fusil; mascle; rustre; roundel;\r\nbillet, together with the diminutives of such of these as are in use.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the origin of these ordinaries, by the use of which term\r\nis meant for the moment the rectilinear figures peculiar to armory, it may\r\nbe worth the passing mention that the said origin is a matter of some\r\nmystery. Guillim and the old writers almost universally take them to be\r\nderived from the actual military scarf or a representation of it placed\r\nacross the shield in various forms. Other writers, taking the surcoat and\r\nits decoration as the real origin of coats of arms, derive {109} the\r\nordinaries from the belt, scarf, and other articles of raiment. Planché, on\r\nthe other hand, scouted such a derivation, putting forward upon very good\r\nand plausible grounds the simple argument that the origin of the ordinaries\r\nis to be found in the cross-pieces of wood placed across a shield for\r\nstrengthening purposes. He instances cases in which shields, apparently\r\ncharged with ordinaries but really strengthened with cross-pieces, can be\r\ntaken back to a period long anterior to the existence of regularised\r\narmory. But then, on the other hand, shields can be found decorated with\r\nanimals at an equally early or even an earlier period, and I am inclined\r\nmyself to push Planché's own argument even farther than he himself took it,\r\nand assert unequivocally that the ordinaries had in themselves no\r\nparticular symbolism and no definable origin whatever beyond that easy\r\nmethod of making some pattern upon a shield which was to be gained by using\r\nstraight lines. That they ever had any military meaning, I cannot see the\r\nslightest foundation to believe; their suggested and asserted symbolism I\r\ntotally deny. But when we can find, as Planché did, that shields were\r\nstrengthened with cross-pieces in various directions, it is quite natural\r\nto suppose that these cross-pieces afforded a ready means of decoration in\r\ncolour, and this would lead a good deal of other decoration to follow\r\nsimilar forms, even in the absence of cross-pieces upon the definite shield\r\nitself. The one curious point which rather seems to tell against Planché's\r\ntheory is that in the earliest \"rolls\" of arms but a comparatively small\r\nproportion of the arms are found to consist of these rectilinear figures,\r\nand if the ordinaries really originated in strengthening cross-pieces one\r\nwould have expected a larger number of such coats of arms to be found; but\r\nat the same time such arms would, in many cases, in themselves be so\r\npalpably mere meaningless decoration of cross-pieces upon plain shields,\r\nthat the resulting design would not carry with it such a compulsory\r\nremembrance as would a design, for example, derived from lines which had\r\nplainly had no connection with the construction of the shield. Nor could it\r\nhave any such basis of continuity. Whilst a son would naturally paint a\r\nlion upon his shield if his father had done the same, there certainly would\r\nnot be a similar inducement for a son to follow his father's example where\r\nthe design upon a shield were no more than different-coloured strengthening\r\npieces, because if these were gilt, for example, the son would naturally be\r\nno more inclined to perpetuate a particular form of strengthening for his\r\nshield, which might not need it, than any particular artistic division with\r\nwhich it was involved, so that the absence of arms composed of ordinaries\r\nfrom the early rolls of arms may not amount to so very much. Still further,\r\nit may well be concluded that the compilers of early rolls {110} of arms,\r\nor the collectors of the details from which early rolls were made at a\r\nlater date, may have been tempted to ignore, and may have been justified in\r\ndiscarding from their lists of arms, those patterns and designs which\r\npalpably were then no more than a meaningless colouring of the\r\nstrengthening pieces, but which patterns and designs by subsequent\r\ncontinuous usage and perpetuation became accepted later by certain families\r\nas the \"arms\" their ancestors had worn. It is easy to see that such\r\nmeaningless patterns would have less chance of survival by continuity of\r\nusage, and at the same time would require a longer continuity of usage,\r\nbefore attaining to fixity as a definite design.\r\n\r\nThe undoubted symbolism of the cross in so many early coats of arms has\r\nbeen urged strongly by those who argue either for a symbolism for all these\r\nrectilinear figures or for an origin in articles of dress. But the figure\r\nof the cross preceded Christianity and organised armory, and it had an\r\nobvious decorative value which existed before, and which exists now outside\r\nany attribute it may have of a symbolical nature. That it is an utterly\r\nfallacious argument must be admitted when it is remembered that two lines\r\nat right angles make a cross--probably the earliest of all forms of\r\ndecoration--and that the cross existed before its symbolism. Herein it\r\ndiffers from other forms of decoration (e.g. the Masonic emblems) which\r\ncannot be traced beyond their symbolical existence. The cross, like the\r\nother heraldic rectilinear figures, came into existence, meaningless as a\r\ndecoration for a shield, before armory as such existed, and probably before\r\nChristianity began. Then being in existence the Crusading instinct\r\ndoubtless caused its frequent selection with an added symbolical meaning.\r\nBut the argument can truthfully be pushed no farther.\r\n\r\nTHE BEND\r\n\r\nThe bend is a broad band going from the dexter chief corner to the sinister\r\nbase (Fig. 65). According to the old theorists this should contain the\r\nthird part of the field. As a matter of fact it hardly ever does, and\r\nseldom did even in the oldest examples. Great latitude is allowed to the\r\nartist on this point, in accordance with whether the bend be plain or\r\ncharged, and more particularly according to the charges which accompany it\r\nin the shield and their disposition thereupon.\r\n\r\n\"Azure, a bend or,\" is the well-known coat concerning which the historic\r\ncontroversy was waged between Scrope and Grosvenor. As every one knows, it\r\nwas finally adjudged to belong to the former, and a right to it has also\r\nbeen proved by the Cornish family of Carminow. {111}\r\n\r\nA bend is, of course, subject to the usual variations of the lines of\r\npartition (Figs. 66-75).\r\n\r\nA bend compony (Fig. 76), will be found in the arms of Beaumont, and the\r\ndifference between this (in which the panes run with the bend) and a bend\r\nbarry (in which the panes are horizontal, Fig. 77), as in the arms of\r\nKing,[7] should be noticed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Bend.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--Bend engrailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Bend invecked.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Bend embattled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--Bend embattled counter-embattled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Bend raguly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--Bend dovetailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--Bend indented.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Bend dancetté.]\r\n\r\nA bend wavy is not very usual, but will be found in the arms of Wallop, De\r\nBurton, and Conder. A bend raguly appears in the arms of Strangman. {112}\r\n\r\nWhen a bend and a bordure appear upon the same arms, the bend is not\r\ncontinued over the bordure, and similarly it does not surmount a tressure\r\n(Fig. 78), but stops within it.\r\n\r\nA bend upon a bend is by no means unusual. An example of this will be found\r\nin a coat of Waller. Cases where this happens need to be carefully\r\nscrutinised to avoid error in blazoning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--Bend wavy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Bend nebuly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--Bend compony.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Bend barry.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Bend within tressure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--Bend lozengy.]\r\n\r\nA bend lozengy, or of lozenges (Fig. 79), will be found in the arms of\r\nBolding.\r\n\r\nA bend flory and counterflory will be found in the arms of Fellows, a\r\nquartering of Tweedy.\r\n\r\nA bend chequy will be found in the arms of Menteith, and it should be\r\nnoticed that the checks run the way of the bend.\r\n\r\nErmine spots upon a bend are represented the way of the bend.\r\n\r\nOccasionally two bends will be found, as in the arms of Lever: Argent, two\r\nbends sable, the upper one engrailed (_vide_ Lyon Register--escutcheon of\r\npretence on the arms of Goldie-Scot of Craigmore, 1868); or as in the arms\r\nof James Ford, of Montrose, 1804: Gules, two bends vairé argent and sable,\r\non a chief or, a greyhound courant sable between two towers gules. A\r\ndifferent form appears in the arms of Zorke or Yorke (see Papworth), which\r\nare blazoned: Azure, a bend argent, impaling argent, a bend azure. A\r\nsolitary instance of _three_ bends (which, however, effectually proves that\r\na bend cannot {113} occupy the third part of the field) occurs in the arms\r\nof Penrose, matriculated in Lyon Register in 1795 as a quartering of\r\nCumming-Gordon of Altyre. These arms of Penrose are: Argent, three bends\r\nsable, each charged with as many roses of the field.\r\n\r\nA charge half the width of a bend is a bendlet (Fig. 80), and one half the\r\nwidth of a bendlet is a cottise (Fig. 81), but a cottise cannot exist\r\nalone, inasmuch as it has of itself neither direction nor position, but is\r\nonly found accompanying one of the ordinaries. The arms of Harley are an\r\nexample of a bend cottised.\r\n\r\nBendlets will very seldom be found either in addition to a bend, or\r\ncharged, but the arms of Vaile show both these peculiarities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Bendlets.]\r\n\r\nA bend will usually be found between two charges. Occasionally it will be\r\nfound between four, but more frequently between six. In none of these cases\r\nis it necessary to specify the position of the subsidiary charges. It is\r\npresumed that the bend separates them into even numbers, but their exact\r\nposition (beyond this) upon the shield is left to the judgment of the\r\nartist, and their disposition is governed by the space left available by\r\nthe shape of the shield. A further presumption is permitted in the case of\r\na bend between _three_ objects, which are presumed to be two in chief and\r\none in base. But even in the case of three the position will be usually\r\nfound to be specifically stated, as would be the case with any other uneven\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--Bend cottised.]\r\n\r\nCharges on a bend are placed in the direction of the bend. In such cases it\r\nis not necessary to specify that the charges are bendwise. When a charge or\r\ncharges occupy the position which a bend would, they are said to be placed\r\n\"in bend.\" This is not the same thing as a charge placed \"bendwise\" (or\r\nbendways). In this case the charge itself is slanted into the angle at\r\nwhich the bend crosses the shield, but the position of the charge upon the\r\nshield is not governed thereby.\r\n\r\nWhen a bend and chief occur together in the same arms, the chief will\r\nusually surmount the bend, the latter issuing from the angle between the\r\nbase of the chief and the side of the shield. An instance to the contrary,\r\nhowever, will be found in the arms of Fitz-Herbert of Swynnerton, in which\r\nthe bend is continued over the chief. This instance, however (as doubtless\r\nall others of the kind), is due to the {114} use of the bend in early times\r\nas a mark of difference. The coat of arms, therefore, had an earlier and\r\nseparate existence without the bend, which has been superimposed as a\r\ndifference upon a previously existing coat. The use of the bend as a\r\ndifference will be again referred to when considering more fully the marks\r\nand methods of indicating cadency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Bend sinister.]\r\n\r\nA curious instance of the use of the sun's rays in bend will be found in\r\nthe arms of Warde-Aldam.[8]\r\n\r\nThe bend sinister (Fig. 82), is very frequently stated to be the mark of\r\nillegitimacy. It certainly has been so used upon some occasions, but these\r\noccasions are very few and far between, the charge more frequently made use\r\nof being the bendlet or its derivative the baton (Fig. 83). These will be\r\ntreated more fully in the chapter on the marks of illegitimacy. The bend\r\nsinister, which is a band running from the sinister chief corner through\r\nthe centre of the escutcheon to the dexter base, need not necessarily\r\nindicate bastardy. Naturally the popular idea which has originated and\r\nbecome stereotyped concerning it renders its appearance extremely rare, but\r\nin at least two cases it occurs without, as far as I am aware, carrying any\r\nsuch meaning. At any rate, in neither case are the coats \"bastardised\"\r\nversions of older arms. These cases are the arms of Shiffner: \"Azure, a\r\nbend sinister, in chief two estoiles, in like bend or; in base the end and\r\nstock of an anchor gold, issuing from waves of the sea proper;\" and\r\nBurne-Jones: \"Azure, on a bend sinister argent, between seven mullets, four\r\nin chief and three in base or, three pairs of wings addorsed purpure.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Baton sinister.]\r\n\r\nNo coat with the chief charge a single bendlet occurs in Papworth. A single\r\ncase, however, is to be found in the Lyon Register in the duly matriculated\r\narms of Porterfield of that Ilk: \"Or, a bendlet between a stag's head\r\nerased in chief and a hunting-horn in base sable, garnished gules.\" Single\r\nbendlets, however, both dexter and sinister, occur as ancient difference\r\nmarks, and are then sometimes known as ribands. So described, it occurs in\r\nblazon of the arms of Abernethy: \"Or, a lion rampant gules, debruised of a\r\nribbon sable,\" quartered by Lindsay, Earl of Crawford and Balcarres; but\r\nhere again the bendlet is a mark {115} of cadency. In the _Gelre Armorial_,\r\nin this particular coat the ribbon is made \"engrailed,\" which is most\r\nunusual, and which does not appear to be the accepted form. In many of the\r\nScottish matriculations of this Abernethy coat in which this riband occurs\r\nit is termed a \"cost,\" doubtless another form of the word cottise.\r\n\r\nWhen a bend or bendlets (or, in fact, any other charge) are raised above\r\ntheir natural position in the shield they are termed \"enhanced\" (Fig. 84).\r\nAn instance of this occurs in the well-known coat of Byron, viz.: \"Argent,\r\nthree bendlets enhanced gules,\" and in the arms of Manchester, which were\r\nbased upon this coat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Bendlets enhanced.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--Pale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Pale engrailed.]\r\n\r\nWhen the field is composed of an even number of equal pieces divided by\r\nlines following the angle of a bend the field is blazoned \"bendy\" of so\r\nmany (Fig. 58). In most cases it will be composed of six or eight pieces,\r\nbut as there is no diminutive of \"bendy,\" the number must always be stated.\r\n\r\nTHE PALE\r\n\r\nThe pale is a broad perpendicular band passing from the top of the\r\nescutcheon to the bottom (Fig. 85). Like all the other ordinaries, it is\r\nstated to contain the third part of the area of the field, and it is the\r\nonly one which is at all frequently drawn in that proportion. But even with\r\nthe pale, the most frequent occasion upon which this proportion is\r\ndefinitely given, this exaggerated width will be presently explained. The\r\nartistic latitude, however, permits the pale to be drawn of this proportion\r\nif this be convenient to the charges upon it.\r\n\r\nLike the other ordinaries, the pale will be found varied by the different\r\nlines of partition (Figs. 86-94).\r\n\r\nThe single circumstance in which the pale is regularly drawn to contain a\r\nfull third of the field by measurement is when the coat is \"per fess and a\r\npale counterchanged.\" This, it will be noticed, divides the shield into six\r\nequal portions (Fig. 95). The ease with which, by {116} the employment of\r\nthese conditions, a new coat can be based upon an old one which shall leave\r\nthree original charges in the same position, and upon a field of the\r\noriginal tincture, and yet shall produce an entirely different and distinct\r\ncoat of arms, has led to this particular form being constantly repeated in\r\nmodern grants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Pale invecked.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--Pale embattled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Pale raguly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Pale dovetailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--Pale indented.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--Pale wavy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--Pale nebuly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--Pale rayonné.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--Pale per fesse counter changed.]\r\n\r\nThe diminutive of the pale is the pallet (Fig. 96), and the pale cottised\r\nis sometimes termed \"endorsed.\"\r\n\r\nExcept when it is used as a mark of difference or distinction (then usually\r\nwavy), the pallet is not found singly; but two pallets, or three, are not\r\nexceptional. Charged upon other ordinaries, particularly on the chief and\r\nthe chevron, pallets are of constant occurrence. {117}\r\n\r\nWhen the field is striped vertically it is said to be \"paly\" of so many\r\n(Fig. 57).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--Pallets.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--The arms of Amaury de Montfort, Earl of\r\nGloucester; died before 1214. (From his seal.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--Arms of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester; died\r\n1265. (From MS. Cott., Nero, D. 1.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--Fess.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--Fess engrailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--Fess invecked.]\r\n\r\nThe arms shown in Fig. 97 are interesting inasmuch as they are doubtless an\r\nearly form of the coat per pale indented argent and gules, which is\r\ngenerally described as a banner borne for the honour of Hinckley, by the\r\nSimons de Montfort, Earls of Leicester, father and son. In a Roll _temp._\r\nHenry III., to Simon the younger is ascribed \"Le Banner party endentee\r\ndargent & de goules,\" although the arms of both father and son are known to\r\nhave been as Fig. 98: \"Gules, a lion rampant queue-fourchée argent.\" More\r\nprobably the indented coat gives the original Montfort arms.\r\n\r\nTHE FESS\r\n\r\nThe fess is a broad horizontal band crossing the escutcheon in the centre\r\n(Fig. 99). It is seldom drawn to contain a full third of the area of the\r\nshield. It is subject to the lines of partition (Figs. 100-109). {118}\r\n\r\nA curious variety of the fess dancetté is borne by the Shropshire family\r\nPlowden of Plowden. They bear: Azure, a fess dancetté, the upper points\r\nterminating in fleurs-de-lis (Fig. 110). A fess couped (Fig. 111) is found\r\nin the arms of Lee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--Fess embattled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--Fess embattled counter-embattled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--Fess raguly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--Fess dovetailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--Fess indented.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--Fess dancetté.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--Fess wavy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--Fess nebuly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--The arms of Plowden.]\r\n\r\nThe \"fess embattled\" is only crenellated upon the upper edge; but when both\r\nedges are embattled it is a fess embattled and counter-embattled. The term\r\n_bretessé_ (which is said to indicate that the battlements on the upper\r\nedge are opposite the battlements on the lower edge, and the indentations\r\nlikewise corresponding) is a term and a distinction neither of which are\r\nregarded in British armory. {119}\r\n\r\nA fess wreathed (Fig. 112) is a bearing which seems to be almost peculiar\r\nto the Carmichael family, but the arms of Waye of Devon are an additional\r\nexample, being: Sable, two bars wreathed argent and gules. I know of no\r\nother ordinary borne in a wreathed form, but there seems no reason why this\r\npeculiarity should be confined to the fess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--Fess couped.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--Fess wreathed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--Two Bars.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--Bars embattled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--Bars engrailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--Bars invecked.]\r\n\r\nIt is a fixed rule of British armory that there can be only _one_ fess upon\r\na shield. If two figures of this character are found they are termed _bars_\r\n(Fig. 113). But it is hardly correct to speak of the bar as a diminutive of\r\nthe fess, because if two bars only appear on the shield there would be\r\nlittle, if any, diminution made from the width of the fess when depicting\r\nthe bars. As is the case with other ordinaries, there is much latitude\r\nallowed to the artist in deciding the dimensions, it being usually\r\npermitted for these to be governed by the charges upon the fess or bars,\r\nand the charges between which these are placed.\r\n\r\nBars, like the fess, are of course equally subject to all the varying lines\r\nof partition (Figs. 114-118).\r\n\r\nThe diminutive of the bar is the barrulet, which is half its width and\r\ndouble the width of the cottise. But the barrulet will _almost invariably_\r\nbe found borne in _pairs_, when such a pair is usually known as a \"bar\r\ngemel\" and not as two barrulets. Thus a coat with four barrulets {120}\r\nwould have these placed at equal distances from each other; but a coat with\r\ntwo bars gemel would be depicted with two of its barrulets placed closely\r\ntogether in chief and two placed closely together in base, the disposition\r\nbeing governed by the fact that the two barrulets comprising the \"bar\r\ngemel\" are only _one charge_. Fig. 119 shows three bars gemel. There is\r\ntheoretically no limit to the number of bars or bars gemel which can be\r\nplaced upon the shield. In practical use, however, four will be found the\r\nmaximum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--Bars raguly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--Bars dovetailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--Bars gemel.]\r\n\r\nA field composed of four, six, eight, or ten horizontal pieces of equal\r\nwidth is \"barry of such and such a number of pieces,\" the number being\r\nalways specified (Figs. 55 and 56). A field composed of an equal number of\r\nhorizontally shaped pieces, when these exceed ten in number, is termed\r\n\"barruly\" of such and such a number. The term barruly is also sometimes\r\nused for ten pieces. If the number is omitted \"barry\" will usually be of\r\nsix pieces, though sometimes of eight. On the other hand a field composed\r\nof five, seven, or nine pieces is not barry, but (_e.g._) two bars, three\r\nbars, and four bars respectively. This distinction in modern coats needs to\r\nbe carefully noted, but in ancient coats it is not of equal importance.\r\nAnciently also a shield \"barry\" was drawn of a greater number of pieces\r\n(see Figs. 120, 121 and 122) than would nowadays be employed. In modern\r\narmory a field so depicted would more correctly be termed \"barruly.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst a field can be and often is barry of two colours or two metals, an\r\nuneven number of pieces must of necessity be of metal and colour or fur.\r\nConsequently in a shield _e.g._ divided into seven equal horizontal\r\ndivisions, alternately gules and sable, there must be a mistake somewhere.\r\n\r\nAlthough these distinctions require to be carefully noted as regards modern\r\narms, it should be remembered that they are distinctions evolved by the\r\nintricacies and requirements of modern armory, and ancient arms were not so\r\ntrammelled. {121}\r\n\r\nA field divided horizontally into three equal divisions of _e.g._ gules,\r\nsable, and argent is theoretically blazoned by British rules \"party per\r\nfess gules and argent, a fess sable.\" This, however, gives an exaggerated\r\nwidth to the fess which it does not really possess with us, and the German\r\nrules, which would blazon it \"tierced per fess gules, sable, and argent,\"\r\nwould seem preferable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--Arms of William de Valence, Earl of Pembroke (d.\r\n1296); Barruly azure and argent, a label of five points gules, the files\r\ndepending from the chief line of the shield, and each file charged with\r\nthree lions passant guardant or.

Such\r\ncounterchanging should be carefully distinguished from fields which are\r\n\"barry-bendy\" (Fig. 124), or \"paly-bendy\" (Fig. 125). In these latter cases\r\nthe field is divided first by lines horizontal (for barry) or perpendicular\r\n(for paly), and subsequently by lines bendy (dexter or sinister). {122}\r\n\r\nThe result produced is very similar to \"lozengy\" (Fig. 126), and care\r\nshould be taken to distinguish the two.\r\n\r\nBarry-bendy is sometimes blazoned \"fusilly in bend,\" whilst paly-bendy is\r\nsometimes blazoned \"fusilly in bend sinister,\" but the other terms are the\r\nmore accurate and acceptable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--Lozengy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--Chevron.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--Chevron engrailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--Chevron invecked.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--Chevron embattled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.--Chevron embattled and counter-embattled.]\r\n\r\n\"Lozengy\" is made by use of lines in bend crossed by lines in bend sinister\r\n(Fig. 126), and \"fusilly\" the same, only drawn at a more acute angle.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEVRON\r\n\r\nProbably the ordinary of most frequent occurrence in British, as also in\r\nFrench armory, is the chevron (Fig. 127). It is comparatively rare in\r\nGerman heraldry. The term is derived from the French word _chevron_,\r\nmeaning a rafter, and the heraldic chevron is the same shape as a gable\r\nrafter. In early examples of heraldic art the chevron will be found\r\ndepicted reaching very nearly to the top of the shield, the angle contained\r\nwithin the chevron being necessarily more acute. The chevron then attained\r\nvery much more nearly to its full area of one-third of the field than is\r\nnow given to it. As the chevron became accompanied by charges, it was\r\nnaturally drawn so that it would allow of these charges being more easily\r\nrepresented, and its height became {123} less whilst the angle it enclosed\r\nwas increased. But now, as then, it is perfectly at the pleasure of the\r\nartist to design his chevron at the height and angle which will best allow\r\nthe proper representation of the charges which accompany it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.--Chevron indented.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.--Chevron wavy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.--Chevron nebuly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.--Chevron raguly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.--Chevron dovetailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.--Chevron doubly cottised.]\r\n\r\nThe chevron, of course, is subject to the usual lines of partition (Figs.\r\n128-136), and can be cottised and doubly cottised (Fig. 137).\r\n\r\nIt is usually found between three charges, but the necessity of modern\r\ndifferentiation has recently introduced the disposition of four charges,\r\nthree in chief and one in base, which is by no means a happy invention. An\r\neven worse disposition occurs in the arms of a certain family of Mitchell,\r\nwhere the four escallops which are the principal charges are arranged two\r\nin chief and two in base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.--Chevron quarterly.]\r\n\r\nErmine spots upon a chevron do not follow the direction of it, but in the\r\ncases of chevrons vair, and chevrons chequy, authoritative examples can be\r\nfound in which the chequers and rows of vair both do, and do not, conform\r\nto the direction of the chevron. My own preference is to make the rows\r\nhorizontal.\r\n\r\nA chevron quarterly is divided by a line chevronwise, apparently {124}\r\ndividing the chevron into two chevronels, and then by a vertical line in\r\nthe centre (Fig. 138).\r\n\r\nA chevron in point embowed will be found in the arms of Trapaud quartered\r\nby Adlercron (Fig. 139).\r\n\r\nA field per chevron (Fig. 52) is often met with, and the division line in\r\nthis case (like the enclosing lines of a real chevron) is subject to the\r\nusual partition lines, but how one is to determine the differentiation\r\nbetween per chevron engrailed and per chevron invecked I am uncertain, but\r\nthink the points should be upwards for engrailed.\r\n\r\nThe field when entirely composed of an even number of chevrons is termed\r\n\"chevronny\" (Fig. 59).\r\n\r\nThe diminutive of the chevron is the chevronel (Fig. 140).\r\n\r\nChevronels \"interlaced\" or \"braced\" (Fig. 141), will be found in the arms\r\nof Sirr. The chevronel is very seldom met with singly, but a case of this\r\nwill be found in the arms of Spry.\r\n\r\nA chevron \"rompu\" or broken is depicted as in Fig. 142.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    FIG. 139.--Armorial bearings of Rodolph Ladeveze Adlercron, Esq.:\r\n    Quarterly, 1 and 4, argent, an eagle displayed, wings inverted sable,\r\n    langued gules, membered and ducally crowned or (for Adlercron): 2 and\r\n    3, argent, a chevron in point embowed between in chief two mullets and\r\n    in base a lion rampant all gules (for Trapaud).

Motto: \"Quo\r\n    fata vocant.\"\r\n\r\nTHE PILE\r\n\r\nThe pile (Fig. 143) is a triangular wedge usually (and unless otherwise\r\nspecified) issuing from the chief. The pile is subject to the usual lines\r\nof partition (Figs. 144-151).\r\n\r\nThe early representation of the pile (when coats of arms had no secondary\r\ncharges and were nice and simple) made the point nearly reach to the base\r\nof the escutcheon, and as a consequence it naturally was not so wide. It is\r\nnow usually drawn so that its upper edge occupies very nearly the whole of\r\nthe top line of the escutcheon; but {125} the angles and proportions of the\r\npile are very much at the discretion of the artist, and governed by the\r\ncharges which need to be introduced in the field of the escutcheon or upon\r\nthe pile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.--Chevronels.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.--Chevronels braced.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.--Chevron rompu.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.--Pile.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.--Pile engrailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.--Pile invecked.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.--Pile embattled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.--Pile indented.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148.--Pile wavy.]\r\n\r\nA single pile may issue from any point of the escutcheon except the base;\r\nthe arms of Darbishire showing a pile issuing from the dexter chief point.\r\n\r\nA single pile cannot issue in base if it be unaccompanied by other piles,\r\nas the field would then be blazoned per chevron.\r\n\r\nTwo piles issuing in chief will be found in the arms of Holles, Earl of\r\nClare.\r\n\r\nWhen three piles, instead of pointing directly at right angles to the line\r\nof the chief, all point to the same point, touching or nearly touching\r\n{126} at the tips, as in the arms of the Earl of Huntingdon and Chester or\r\nin the arms of Isham,[9] they are described as three piles in point. This\r\nterm and its differentiation probably are modern refinements, as with the\r\nearly long-pointed shield any other position was impossible. The arms of\r\nHenderson show three piles issuing from the sinister side of the\r\nescutcheon.\r\n\r\nA disposition of three piles which will very frequently be found in modern\r\nBritish heraldry is two issuing in chief and one in base (Fig. 152).\r\n\r\nPiles terminating in fleurs-de-lis or crosses patée are to be met with, and\r\nreference may be made to the arms of Poynter and Dickson-Poynder. Each of\r\nthese coats has the field pily counter-pily, the points ending in crosses\r\nformée.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.--Pile nebuly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150.--Pile raguly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.--Pile dovetailed.]\r\n\r\nAn unusual instance of a pile in which it issues from a chevron will be\r\nfound in the arms of Wright, which are: \"Sable, on a chevron argent, three\r\nspear-heads gules, in chief two unicorns' heads erased argent, armed and\r\nmaned or, in base on a pile of the last, issuant from the chevron, a\r\nunicorn's head erased of the field.\"\r\n\r\nTHE SHAKEFORK\r\n\r\nThe pall, pairle, or shakefork (Fig. 153), is almost unknown in English\r\nheraldry, but in Scotland its constant occurrence in the arms of the\r\nCunninghame and allied families has given it a recognised position among\r\nthe ordinaries.\r\n\r\nAs usually borne by the Cunninghame family the ends are couped and pointed,\r\nbut in some cases it is borne throughout.\r\n\r\nThe pall in its proper ecclesiastical form appears in the arms of the\r\nArchiepiscopal Sees of Canterbury, Armagh, and Dublin. Though {127} in\r\nthese cases the pall or pallium (Fig. 154), is now considered to have no\r\nother heraldic status than that of an appropriately ecclesiastical charge\r\nupon an official coat of arms, there can be very little doubt that\r\noriginally the pall of itself was the heraldic symbol in this country of an\r\narchbishop, and borne for that reason by all archbishops, including the\r\nArchbishop of York, although his official archiepiscopal coat is now\r\nchanged to: \"Gules, two keys in saltire argent, in chief a royal crown or.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.--Three piles, two in chief and one in base.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.--Shakefork.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.--Ecclesiastical pallium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.--Cross.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156.--Cross engrailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157.--Cross invecked.]\r\n\r\nThe necessity of displaying this device of rank--the pallium--upon a field\r\nof some tincture has led to its corruption into a usual and stereotyped\r\n\"charge.\"\r\n\r\nTHE CROSS\r\n\r\nThe heraldic cross (Fig. 155), the huge preponderance of which in armory we\r\nof course owe to the Crusades, like all other armorial charges, has\r\nstrangely developed. There are nearly four hundred varieties known to\r\narmory, or rather to heraldic text-books, and doubtless authenticated\r\nexamples could be found of most if not of them all. But some dozen or\r\ntwenty forms are about as many as will be found regularly or constantly\r\noccurring. Some but not all of the varieties of the cross are subject to\r\nthe lines of partition (Figs. 156-161). {128}\r\n\r\nWhen the heraldic cross was first assumed with any reason beyond\r\ngeometrical convenience, there can be no doubt that it was intended to\r\nrepresent the Sacred Cross itself. The symbolism of the cross is older than\r\nour present system of armory, but the cross itself is more ancient than its\r\nsymbolism. A cross depicted upon the long, pointed shields of those who\r\nfought for the Cross would be of that shape, with the elongated arm in\r\nbase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158.--Cross embattled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.--Cross indented.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160.--Cross raguly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161.--Cross dovetailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162.--Passion Cross.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163.--Cross Calvary.]\r\n\r\nBut the contemporary shortening of the shield, together with the\r\nintroduction of charges in its angles, led naturally to the arms of the\r\ncross being so disposed that the parts of the field left visible were as\r\nnearly as possible equal. The Sacred Cross, therefore, in heraldry is now\r\nknown as a \"Passion Cross\" (Fig. 162) (or sometimes as a \"long cross\"), or,\r\nif upon steps or \"grieces,\" the number of which needs to be specified, as a\r\n\"Cross Calvary\" (Fig. 163). The crucifix (Fig. 164), under that description\r\nis sometimes met with as a charge.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary heraldic cross (Fig. 155) is always continued throughout the\r\nshield unless stated to be couped (Fig. 165).\r\n\r\nOf the crosses more regularly in use may be mentioned the cross botonny\r\n(Fig. 166), the cross flory (Fig. 167), which must be distinguished from\r\nthe cross fleuretté (Fig. 168); the cross moline, {129} (Fig. 169), the\r\ncross potent (Fig. 170), the cross patée or formée (Fig. 171), the cross\r\npatonce (Fig. 172), and the cross crosslet (Fig. 173).\r\n\r\nPLATE III.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164.--Crucifix.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.--Cross couped.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.--Cross botonny.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.--Cross flory.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.--Cross fleuretté.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.--Cross moline.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170.--Cross potent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171.--Cross patée (or formée).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172.--Cross patonce.]\r\n\r\nOf other but much more uncommon varieties examples will be found of the\r\ncross parted and fretty (Fig. 174), of the cross patée quadrate (Fig. 175),\r\nof a cross pointed and voided in the arms of Dukinfield (quartered by\r\nDarbishire), and of a cross cleché voided and pometté as in the arms of\r\nCawston. A cross quarter-pierced (Fig. 176) has the field visible at the\r\ncentre. A cross tau or St. Anthony's Cross is shown in Fig. 177, the real\r\nMaltese Cross in Fig. 178, and the Patriarchal Cross in Fig. 179. {130}\r\n\r\nWhenever a cross or cross crosslet has the bottom arm elongated and pointed\r\nit is said to be \"fitched\" (Figs. 180 and 181), but when a point is added\r\nat the foot_ e.g._ of a cross patée, it is then termed \"fitchée at the\r\nfoot\" (Fig. 182).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 173.--Cross crosslet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 174.--Cross parted and fretty.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 175.--Cross patée quadrate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 176.--Cross quarter-pierced.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 177.--Cross Tau.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 178.--Maltese Cross.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 179.--Patriarchal Cross.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 180.--Cross crosslet fitched.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 181.--Cross patée fitched.]\r\n\r\nOf the hundreds of other varieties it may confidently be said that a large\r\nproportion originated in misunderstandings of the crude drawings of early\r\narmorists, added to the varying and alternating descriptions applied at a\r\nmore pliable and fluent period of heraldic blazon. A striking illustration\r\nof this will be found in the cross botonny, which is now, and has been for\r\na long time past, regularised with us as a distinct variety of {131}\r\nconstant occurrence. From early illustrations there is now no doubt that\r\nthis was the original form, or one of the earliest forms, of the cross\r\ncrosslet. It is foolish to ignore these varieties, reducing all crosses to\r\na few original forms, for they are now mostly stereotyped and accepted; but\r\nat the same time it is useless to attempt to learn them, for in a lifetime\r\nthey will mostly be met with but once each or thereabouts. A field semé of\r\ncross crosslets (Fig. 183) is termed crusilly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 182.--Cross patée fitched at foot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 183.--Crusilly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 184.--Saltire.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 185.--Saltire engrailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186.--Saltire invecked.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 187.--Saltire embattled.]\r\n\r\nTHE SALTIRE\r\n\r\nThe saltire or saltier (Fig. 184) is more frequently to be met with in\r\nScottish than in English heraldry. This is not surprising, inasmuch as the\r\nsaltire is known as the Cross of St. Andrew, the Patron Saint of Scotland.\r\nIts form is too well known to need description. It is of course subject to\r\nthe usual partition lines (Figs. 185-192).\r\n\r\nWhen a saltire is charged the charges are usually placed conformably\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\nThe field of a coat of arms is often per saltire.\r\n\r\nWhen one saltire couped is the principal charge it will usually be {132}\r\nfound that it is couped conformably to the outline of the shield; but if\r\nthe couped saltire be one of a number or a subsidiary charge it will be\r\nfound couped by horizontal lines, or by lines at right angles. The saltire\r\nhas not developed into so many varieties of form as the cross, and (_e.g._)\r\na saltire botonny is assumed to be a cross botonny placed saltireways, but\r\na saltire parted and fretty is to be met with (Fig. 193).\r\n\r\nTHE CHIEF\r\n\r\nThe chief (Fig. 194), which is a broad band across the top of the shield\r\ncontaining (theoretically, but not in fact) the uppermost third of the area\r\nof the field, is a very favourite ordinary. It is of course subject to the\r\nvariations of the usual partition lines (Figs. 195-203). It is usually\r\ndrawn to contain about one-fifth of the area of the field, though in cases\r\nwhere it is used for a landscape augmentation it will usually be found of a\r\nrather greater area.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 188.--Saltire indented.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 189.--Saltire wavy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 190.--Saltire nebuly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 191.--Saltire raguly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 192.--Saltire dovetailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 193.--Saltire parted and fretty.]\r\n\r\nThe chief especially lent itself to the purposes of honourable\r\naugmentation, and is constantly found so employed. As such it will be\r\nreferred to in the chapter upon augmentations, but a chief of this\r\ncharacter may perhaps be here referred to with advantage, as this will\r\n{133} indicate the greater area often given to it under these conditions,\r\nas in the arms of Ross-of-Bladensburg (Plate II.).\r\n\r\nKnights of the old Order of St. John of Jerusalem and also of the modern\r\nOrder of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem in England display above\r\ntheir personal arms a chief of the order, but this will be dealt with more\r\nfully in the chapter relating to the insignia of knighthood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 194.--Chief.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 195.--Chief engrailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 196.--Chief invecked.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 197.--Chief embattled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 198.--Chief indented.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 199.--Chief dancetté.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 200.--Chief wavy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 201.--Chief nebuly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 202.--Chief raguly.]\r\n\r\nSave in exceptional circumstances, the chief is never debruised or\r\nsurmounted by any ordinary.\r\n\r\nThe chief is ordinarily superimposed over the tressure and over the\r\nbordure, partly defacing them by the elimination of the upper {134} part\r\nthereof. This happens with the bordure when it is a part of the original\r\ncoat of arms. If, however, the chief were in existence at an earlier period\r\nand the bordure is added later as a mark of difference, the bordure\r\nsurrounds the chief. On the other hand, if a bordure exists, even as a mark\r\nof difference, and a chief of augmentation is _subsequently_ added, or a\r\ncanton for distinction, the chief or the canton in these cases would\r\nsurmount the bordure.\r\n\r\nSimilarly a bend when added later as a mark of difference surmounts the\r\nchief. Such a case is very unusual, as the use of the bend for differencing\r\nhas long been obsolete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 203.--Chief dovetailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 204.--Arms of Peter de Dreux, Earl of Richmond (_c._\r\n1230): Chequy or and azure, a quarter ermine. (From his seal.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 205.--Arms of De Vere, Earls of Oxford: Quarterly gules\r\nand or, in the first quarter a mullet argent.]\r\n\r\nA chief is never couped or cottised, and it has no diminutive in British\r\narmory.\r\n\r\nTHE QUARTER\r\n\r\nThe quarter is not often met with in English armory, the best-known\r\ninstance being the well-known coat of Shirley, Earl Ferrers, viz: Paly of\r\nsix or and azure, a quarter ermine. The arms of the Earls of Richmond (Fig.\r\n204) supply another instance. Of course as a division of the field under\r\nthe blazon of \"quarterly\" (_e.g._ or and azure) it is constantly to be met\r\nwith, but a single quarter is rare.\r\n\r\nOriginally a single quarter was drawn to contain the full fourth part of\r\nthe shield, but with the more modern tendency to reduce the size of all\r\ncharges, its area has been somewhat diminished. Whilst a quarter will only\r\nbe found within a plain partition line, a field divided quarterly\r\n(occasionally, but I think hardly so correctly, termed \"per cross\") is not\r\nso limited. Examples of quarterly fields will be found in the historic\r\nshield of De Vere (Fig. 205) and De Mandeville. An irregular partition line\r\nis often introduced in a new grant to conjoin quarterings {135} borne\r\nwithout authority into one single coat. The diminutive of the quarter is\r\nthe canton (Fig. 206), and the diminutive of that the chequer of a chequy\r\nfield (Fig. 207).\r\n\r\nTHE CANTON\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 206.--Canton.]\r\n\r\nThe canton is supposed to occupy one-third of the chief, and that being\r\nsupposed to occupy one-third of the field, a simple arithmetical sum gives\r\nus one-ninth of the field as the theoretical area of the canton. Curiously\r\nenough, the canton to a certain extent gives us a confirmation of these\r\nancient proportions, inasmuch as all ancient drawings containing both a\r\nfess and a canton depict these conjoined. This will be seen in the Garter\r\nplate of Earl Rivers. In modern days, however, it is very seldom that the\r\ncanton will be depicted of such a size, though in cases where, as in the\r\narms of Boothby, it forms the only charge, it is even nowadays drawn to\r\nclosely approximate to its theoretical area of one-ninth of the field. It\r\nmay be remarked here perhaps that, owing to the fact that there are but few\r\ninstances in which the quarter or the canton have been used as the sole or\r\nprincipal charge, a coat of arms in which these are employed would be\r\ngranted with fewer of the modern bedevilments than would a coat with a\r\nchevron for example. I know of no instance in modern times in which a\r\nquarter, when figuring as a charge, or a canton have been subject to the\r\nusual lines of partition.\r\n\r\nThe canton (with the single exception of the bordure, when used as a mark\r\nof cadency or distinction) is superimposed _over_ every other charge or\r\nordinary, no matter what this may be. Theoretically the canton is supposed\r\nto be always a later addition to the coat, and even though a charge may be\r\naltogether hidden or \"absconded\" by the canton, the charge is always\r\npresumed to be there, and is mentioned in the blazon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 207.--Chequy.]\r\n\r\nBoth a cross and a saltire are sometimes described as \"cantonned\" by\r\nsuch-and-such charges, when they are placed in the blank spaces left by\r\nthese ordinaries. In addition, the spaces left by a cross (but not by a\r\nsaltire) are frequently spoken of _e.g._ as the dexter chief canton or the\r\nsinister base canton. {136}\r\n\r\nThe canton is frequently used to carry an augmentation, and these cantons\r\nof augmentation will be referred to under that heading, though it may be\r\nhere stated that a \"canton of England\" is a canton gules, charged with\r\nthree lions passant guardant or, as in the arms of Lane (Plate II.).\r\n\r\nThe canton, unless it is _an original charge_, need not conform to the rule\r\nforbidding colour on colour, or metal on metal; otherwise the canton of\r\nUlster would often be an impossibility.\r\n\r\nThe canton, with rare exceptions, is always placed in the dexter chief\r\ncorner. The canton of augmentation in the arms of Clerke, Bart.--\"Argent,\r\non a bend gules, between three pellets as many swans of the field; on a\r\nsinister canton azure, a demi-ram salient of the first, and in chief two\r\nfleurs-de-lis or, debruised by a baton\"--is, however, a sinister one, as is\r\nthe canton upon the arms of Charlton. In this latter case the sinister\r\ncanton is used to signify illegitimacy. This will be more fully dealt with\r\nin the chapter upon marks of illegitimacy.\r\n\r\nA curious use of the canton for the purposes of marshalling occurs in the\r\ncase of a woman who, being an heiress herself, has a daughter or daughters\r\nonly, whilst her husband has sons and heirs by another marriage. In such an\r\nevent, the daughter being heir (or in the case of daughters these being\r\ncoheirs) of the mother, but not heir of the father, cannot transmit as\r\nquarterings the arms of the father whom she does not represent, whilst she\r\nought to transmit the arms of the mother whom she does represent. The\r\nhusband of the daughter, therefore, places upon an escutcheon of pretence\r\nthe arms of her mother, with those of her father on a canton thereupon. The\r\nchildren of the marriage quarter this combined coat, the arms of the father\r\nalways remaining upon a canton. This will be more fully dealt with under\r\nthe subject of marshalling.\r\n\r\nThe canton has yet another use as a \"mark of distinction.\" When, under a\r\nRoyal Licence, the name and arms of a family are assumed where there is no\r\nblood descent from the family, the arms have some mark of distinction\r\nadded. This is usually a plain canton. This point will be treated more\r\nfully under \"Marks of Cadency.\"\r\n\r\nWoodward mentions three instances in which the lower edge of the canton is\r\n\"indented,\" one taken from the Calais Roll, viz. the arms of Sir William de\r\nla Zouche--\"Gules, bezantée, a canton indented at the bottom\"--and adds\r\nthat the canton has been sometimes thought to indicate the square banner of\r\na knight-baronet, and he suggests that the lower edge being indented may\r\ngive some weight to the idea. As the canton does not appear to have either\r\npreviously or subsequently formed any part of the arms of Zouche, it is\r\npossible that in this instance some {137} such meaning may have been\r\nintended, but it can have no such application generally.\r\n\r\nThe \"Canton of Ulster\"--_i.e._ \"Argent, a sinister hand couped at the wrist\r\ngules\"--is the badge of a baronet of England, Ireland, Great Britain, or\r\nthe United Kingdom. This badge may be borne upon a canton, dexter or\r\nsinister, or upon an inescutcheon, at the pleasure of the wearer. There is\r\nsome little authority and more precedent for similarly treating the badge\r\nof a Nova Scotian Baronet, but as such Baronets _wear_ their badges it is\r\nmore usually depicted below the shield, depending by the orange tawny\r\nribbon of their order.\r\n\r\nTHE GYRON\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 208.--Gyronny.]\r\n\r\nAs a charge, the gyron (sometimes termed an esquire) is very seldom found,\r\nbut as a subdivision of the field, a coat \"gyronny\" (Fig. 208) is\r\nconstantly met with, all arms for the name of Campbell being gyronny. Save\r\nin rare cases, a field gyronny is divided quarterly and then per saltire,\r\nmaking eight divisions, but it may be gyronny of six, ten, twelve, or more\r\npieces, though such cases are seldom met with and always need to be\r\nspecified. The arms of Campbell of Succoth are gyronny of eight\r\n_engrailed_, a most unusual circumstance. I know of no other instance of\r\nthe use of lines of partition in a gyronny field. The arms of Lanyon afford\r\nan example of the gyron as a charge, as does also the well-known shield of\r\nMortimer (Fig. 209).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 209.--The arms of Roger Mortimer, Earl of March and\r\nUlster (d. 1398): Quarterly, 1 and 4, azure, three bars or (sometimes but\r\nnot so correctly quoted barry of six), on a chief of the first two pallets\r\nbetween two base esquires of the second, over all an inescutcheon argent\r\n(for Mortimer); 2 and 3, or, a cross gules (for Ulster). (From his seal.)]\r\n\r\nTHE INESCUTCHEON\r\n\r\nThe inescutcheon is a shield appearing as a charge upon the coat of arms.\r\nCertain writers state that it is termed an inescutcheon if only one appears\r\nas the charge, but that when more than one is present they are merely\r\ntermed escutcheons. This is an unnecessary refinement not officially\r\nrecognised or adhered to, though unconsciously one often is led to make\r\nthis distinction, which seems to spring naturally to one's mind. {138}\r\n\r\nWhen one inescutcheon appears, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether to\r\nblazon the arms as charged with a bordure or an inescutcheon. Some coats of\r\narms, for example the arms of Molesworth, will always remain more or less a\r\nmatter of uncertainty.\r\n\r\nBut as a matter of fact a bordure should not be wide enough to fill up the\r\nfield left by an inescutcheon, nor an inescutcheon large enough to occupy\r\nthe field left by a bordure.\r\n\r\nThe inescutcheon in German armory (or, as they term it, the heart\r\nescutcheon), when superimposed upon other quarterings, is usually the\r\npaternal or most important coat of arms. The same method of marshalling has\r\nsometimes been adopted in Scotland, and the arms of Hay are an instance. It\r\nusually in British heraldry is used to carry the arms of an heiress wife,\r\nbut both these points will be dealt with later under the subject of\r\nmarshalling. The inescutcheon, no matter what its position, should never be\r\ntermed an escutcheon of pretence if it forms a charge upon the original\r\narms. A curious instance of the use of an inescutcheon will be found in the\r\narms of Gordon-Cumming (Plate III.).\r\n\r\nWhen an inescutcheon appears on a shield it should conform in its outline\r\nto the shape of the shield upon which it is placed.\r\n\r\nTHE BORDURE\r\n\r\nThe bordure (Fig. 210) occurs both as a charge and as a mark of difference.\r\nAs may be presumed from its likeness to our word border, the bordure is\r\nsimply a border round the shield. Except in modern grants in which the\r\nbordure forms a part of the original design of the arms, there can be very\r\nlittle doubt that the bordure has always been a mark of difference to\r\nindicate either cadency or bastardy, but its stereotyped continuance\r\nwithout further alteration in so many coats of arms in which it originally\r\nwas introduced as a difference, and also its appearance in new grants,\r\nleave one no alternative but to treat of it in the ordinary way as a\r\ncharge, leaving the consideration of it as a mark of difference to a future\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThere is no stereotyped or official size for the bordure, the width of\r\nwhich has at all times varied, though it will almost invariably be found\r\nthat a Scottish bordure is depicted rather wider than is an English one;\r\nand naturally a bordure which is charged is a little wider than an entirely\r\nplain one. The bordure of course is subject to {139} all the lines of\r\npartition (Figs. 211-218). Bordures may also be per fesse, per pale (Fig.\r\n219), quarterly (Fig. 220), gyronny (Fig. 221), or tierced in pairle (Fig.\r\n222), &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 210.--Bordure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 211.--Bordure engrailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 212.--Bordure invecked.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 213.--Bordure embattled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 214.--Bordure indented.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 215.--Bordure wavy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 216.--Bordure nebuly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 217.--Bordure dovetailed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 218.--Bordure potenté.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 219.--Bordure per pale.]\r\n\r\nThe bordure has long since ceased to be a mark of cadency in England, but\r\nas a mark of distinction the bordure wavy (Fig. 215) is still used to\r\nindicate bastardy. A bordure of England was granted by Royal warrant as an\r\naugmentation to H.M. Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain, on the occasion of\r\nher marriage. The use of the bordure is, however, the recognised method of\r\ndifferencing in Scotland, but it is curious that with the Scots the bordure\r\nwavy is in no way a mark of illegitimacy. The Scottish bordure for\r\nindicating this fact is {140} the bordure compony (Fig. 223), which has\r\nbeen used occasionally for the same purpose in England, but the bordures\r\nadded to indicate cadency and the various marks to indicate illegitimacy\r\nwill be discussed in later chapters. The difference should here be observed\r\nbetween the bordure compony (Fig. 223), which means illegitimacy; the\r\nbordure counter compony (Fig. 224), which may or may not have that meaning;\r\nand the bordure chequy (Fig. 225), which certainly has no relation to\r\nbastardy. In the two former the panes run with the shield, in the latter\r\nthe chequers do not. Whilst the bordure as a mark of cadency or\r\nillegitimacy surrounds the whole shield, being superimposed upon even the\r\nchief and canton, a bordure when merely a charge gives way to both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 220.--Bordure quarterly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 221.--Bordure gyronny.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 222.--Bordure tierced in pairle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 223.--Bordure compony.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 224.--Bordure counter compony.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 225.--Bordure chequy.]\r\n\r\nA certain rule regarding the bordure is the sole remaining instance in\r\nmodern heraldry of the formerly recognised practice of conjoining two coats\r\nof arms (which it might be necessary to marshal together) by \"dimidiation\"\r\ninstead of using our present-day method of impalement. To dimidiate two\r\ncoats of arms, the dexter half of one shield was conjoined to the sinister\r\nhalf of the other. The objections to such a practice, however, soon made\r\nthemselves apparent (_e.g._ a dimidiated chevron was scarcely\r\ndistinguishable from a bend), and the \"dimidiation\" of arms was quickly\r\nabandoned in favour of {141} \"impalement,\" in which the entire designs of\r\nboth coats of arms are depicted. But in impaling a coat of arms which is\r\nsurrounded by a bordure, the bordure is not continued down the centre\r\nbetween the two coats, but stops short top and bottom at the palar line.\r\nThe same rule, by the way, applies to the tressure, but not to the orle.\r\nThe curious fact, however, remains that this rule as to the dimidiation of\r\nthe bordure in cases of impalement is often found to have been ignored in\r\nancient seals and other examples. The charges upon the bordure are often\r\nthree, but more usually eight in number, in the latter case being arranged\r\nthree along the top of the shield, one at the base point, and two on either\r\nside. The number should, however, always be specified, unless (as in a\r\nbordure bezantée, &c.) it is immaterial; in which case the number eight\r\nmust be _exceeded_ in emblazoning the shield. The rule as to colour upon\r\ncolour does not hold and seems often to be ignored in the cases of\r\nbordures, noticeably when these occur as marks of Scottish cadency.\r\n\r\nTHE ORLE\r\n\r\nThe orle (Fig. 226), or, as it was originally termed in ancient British\r\nrolls of arms, \"un faux ecusson,\" is a narrow bordure following the exact\r\noutline of the shield, but within it, showing the field (for at least the\r\nwidth usually occupied by a bordure) between the outer edge of the orle and\r\nthe edge of the escutcheon. An orle is about half the width of a bordure,\r\nrather less than more, but the proportion is never very exactly maintained.\r\nThe difference may be noted between this figure and the next (Fig. 227),\r\nwhich shows an inescutcheon within a bordure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 226.--Orle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 227.--An inescutcheon within a bordure.]\r\n\r\nThough both forms are very seldom so met with, an orle may be subject to\r\nthe usual lines of partition, and may also be charged. Examples of both\r\nthese variations are met with in the arms of Yeatman-Biggs, and the arms of\r\nGladstone afford an instance of an orle \"flory.\" The arms of Knox, Earl of\r\nRanfurly, are: Gules, a falcon volant or, within an orle wavy on the outer\r\nand engrailed on the inner edge argent.\r\n\r\nWhen a series of charges are placed round the edges of the {142} escutcheon\r\n(_theoretically_ in the position occupied by the orle, but as a matter of\r\nactual fact usually more in the position occupied by the bordure), they are\r\nsaid to be \"in orle,\" which is the correct term, but they will often be\r\nfound blazoned \"an orle of (_e.g._) martlets or mounds.\"\r\n\r\nTHE TRESSURE\r\n\r\nThe tressure is really an orle gemel, _i.e._ an orle divided into two\r\nnarrow ones set closely together, the one inside the other. It is, however,\r\nusually depicted a trifle nearer the edge of the escutcheon than the orle\r\nis generally placed.\r\n\r\nThe tressure cannot be borne singly, as it would then be an orle, but plain\r\ntressures under the name of \"concentric orles\" will be found mentioned in\r\nPapworth. In that Ordinary eight instances are given of arms containing\r\nmore than a single orle, though the eight instances are plainly varieties\r\nof only four coats. Two concentric orles would certainly be a tressure,\r\nsave that perhaps they would be drawn of rather too great a width for the\r\nterm \"tressure\" to be properly applied to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 228.--Tressure flory and counter-flory.]\r\n\r\nIf these instances be disregarded, and I am inclined to doubt them as\r\ngenuine coats, there certainly is no example of a plain tressure in British\r\nheraldry, and one's attention must be directed to the tressure flory and\r\ncounterflory (Fig. 228), so general in Scottish heraldry.\r\n\r\nOriginating entirely in the Royal escutcheon, one cannot do better than\r\nreproduce the remarks of Lyon King of Arms upon the subject from his work\r\n\"Heraldry in relation to Scottish History and Art\":--\r\n\r\n\"William the Lion has popularly got the credit of being the first to\r\nintroduce heraldic bearings into Scotland, and to have assumed the lion as\r\nhis personal cognisance. The latter statement may or may not be true, but\r\nwe have no trace of hereditary arms in Scotland so early as his reign\r\n(1165-1214). Certainly the lion does not appear on his seal, but it does on\r\nthat of his son and successor Alexander II., with apparent remains of the\r\ndouble tressure flory counterflory, a device which is clearly seen on the\r\nseals of Alexander III. (1249-1285). We are unable to say what the reason\r\nwas for the adoption of such a distinctive coat; of course, if you turn to\r\nthe older writers you will find all sorts of fables on the subject. Even\r\nthe sober and sensible Nisbet states that 'the lion has been carried on the\r\narmorial ensign of {143} Scotland since the first founding of the monarchy\r\nby King Fergus I.'--a very mythical personage, who is said to have\r\nflourished about 300 B.C., though he is careful to say that he does not\r\nbelieve arms are as old as that period. He says, however, that it is\r\n'without doubt' that Charlemagne entered into an alliance with Achaius,\r\nKing of Scotland, and for the services of the Scots the French king added\r\nto the Scottish lion the double tressure fleur-de-lisée to show that the\r\nformer had defended the French lilies, and that therefore the latter would\r\nsurround the lion and be a defence to him.\"\r\n\r\nAll this is very pretty, but it is not history. Chalmers remarks in his\r\n\"Caledonia\" that the lion may possibly have been derived from the arms of\r\nthe old Earls of Northumberland and Huntingdon, from whom some of the\r\nScottish kings were descended; and he mentions an old roll of arms\r\npreserved by Leland,[10] which is certainly not later than 1272, in which\r\nthe arms of Scotland are blazoned as: _Or, a lion gules within a bordure or\r\nfleuretté gules_, which we may reasonably interpret as an early indication\r\nof what may be considered as a foreign rendering of the double tressure.\r\nSylvanus Morgan, one of the very maddest of the seventeenth-century\r\nheraldic writers, says that the tressure was added to the shield of\r\nScotland, in testimony of a league between Scotland and France, by Charles\r\nV.; but that king did not ascend the throne of France till 1364, at which\r\ntime we have clear proof that the tressure was a firmly established part of\r\nthe Scottish arms. One of the earliest instances of anything approaching\r\nthe tressure in the Scottish arms which I have met with is in an armorial\r\nof Matthew Paris, which is now in the Cottonian MSS. in the British Museum,\r\nand at one time belonged to St. Alban's Monastery. Here the arms of the\r\nKing of Scotland are given as: \"Or, a lion rampant flory gules in a bordure\r\nof the same.\" The drawing represents a lion within a bordure, the latter\r\nbeing pierced by ten fleurs-de-lis, their heads all looking inwards, the\r\nother end not being free, but attached to the inner margin of the shield.\r\nThis, you will observe, is very like the arms I mentioned as described by\r\nChalmers, and it may possibly be the same volume which may have been\r\nacquired by Sir Robert Cotton. In 1471 there was a curious attempt of the\r\nScottish Parliament to displace the tressure. An Act was passed in that\r\nyear, for some hitherto unexplained reason, by which it was ordained \"that\r\nin tyme to cum thar suld be na double tresor about his (the king's) armys,\r\nbut that he suld ber hale armys of the lyoun without ony mair.\" Seeing that\r\nat the time of this enactment the Scottish kings had borne the tressure for\r\nupwards of 220 years, it is difficult to understand the cause of this\r\nprocedure. Like many other Acts, however, it never seems to have {144} been\r\ncarried into effect; at least I am not aware of even a solitary instance of\r\nthe Scottish arms without the tressure either at or after this period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are other two representations of the Scottish arms in foreign\r\narmorials, to which I may briefly allude. One is in the _Armorial de\r\nGelre_, a beautiful MS. in the Royal Library at Brussels, the Scottish\r\nshields in which have been figured by Mr. Stodart in his book on Scottish\r\narms, and, more accurately, by Sir Archibald Dunbar in a paper read to the\r\nSociety of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1890. The armorial is believed to be\r\nthe work of Claes Heynen, Gelre Herald to the Duke of Gueldres between 1334\r\nand 1372, with later additions by another hand. The coat assigned in it to\r\nthe King of Scotland is the lion and double tressure; the lion is\r\nuncrowned, and is armed and langued azure; above the shield is a helmet\r\nargent adorned behind with a short capelin or plain mantling, on which is\r\nemblazoned the saltire and chief of the Bruces, from which we may gather\r\nthat the arms of David II. are here represented; the lining is blue, which\r\nis unusual, as mantlings are usually lined or doubled with a metal, if not\r\nwith ermine. The helmet is surmounted by an Imperial crown, with a dark\r\ngreen bonnet spotted with red.[11] On the crown there is the crest of a\r\nlion sejant guardant gules, imperially crowned or, holding in his paw a\r\nsword upright; the tail is coué or placed between the hind-legs of the\r\nlion, but it then rises up and flourishes high above his back in a\r\nsufficiently defiant fashion. This shows that the Scottish arms were well\r\nknown on the Continent of Europe nearly a hundred years before the date of\r\nthe Grunenberg MS., while Virgil de Solis (c. 1555) gives a sufficiently\r\naccurate representation of the Royal shield, though the fleur-de-lis all\r\nproject outwards as in the case of Grunenberg; he gives the crest as a lion\r\nrampant holding a sword in bend over his shoulder. Another ancient\r\nrepresentation of the Scottish arms occurs in a MS. treatise on heraldry of\r\nthe sixteenth century, containing the coats of some foreign sovereigns and\r\nother personages, bound up with a Scottish armorial, probably by David\r\nLindsay, Lyon in 1568.\r\n\r\nThe tressure, like the bordure, in the case of an impalement stops at the\r\nline of impalement, as will be seen by a reference to the arms of Queen\r\nAnne after the union of the crowns of England and Scotland.\r\n\r\nIt is now held, both in England and Scotland, that the tressure flory and\r\ncounterflory is, as a part of the Royal Arms, protected, and cannot be\r\ngranted to any person without the express licence of the {145} Sovereign.\r\nThis, however, does not interfere with the matriculation or exemplification\r\nof it in the case of existing arms in which it occurs.\r\n\r\nMany Scottish families bear or claim to bear the Royal tressure by reason\r\nof female descent from the Royal House, but it would seem much more\r\nprobable that in most if not in all cases where it is so borne by right its\r\norigin is due rather to a gift by way of augmentation than to any supposed\r\nright of inheritance. The apparently conflicting statements of origin are\r\nnot really antagonistic, inasmuch as it will be seen from many analogous\r\nEnglish instances (_e.g._ Mowbray, Manners, and Seymour) that near\r\nrelationship is often the only reason to account for the grant of a Royal\r\naugmentation. As an ordinary augmentation of honour it has been frequently\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nThe towns of Aberdeen and Perth obtained early the right of honouring their\r\narms with the addition of the Royal tressure. It appears on the still\r\nexisting matrix of the burgh seal of Aberdeen, which was engraved in 1430.\r\n\r\nJames V. in 1542 granted a warrant to Lyon to surround the arms of John\r\nScot, of Thirlestane, with the Royal tressure, in respect of his ready\r\nservices at Soutra Edge with three score and ten lances on horseback, when\r\nother nobles refused to follow their Sovereign. The grant was put on record\r\nby the grantee's descendant, Patrick, Lord NAPIER, and is the tressured\r\ncoat borne in the second and third quarters of the NAPIER arms.\r\n\r\nWhen the Royal tressure is granted to the bearer of a quartered coat it is\r\nusually placed upon a bordure surrounding the quartered shield, as in the\r\ncase of the arms of the Marquess of QUEENSBERRY, to whom, in 1682, the\r\nRoyal tressure was granted upon a _bordure or_. A like arrangement is borne\r\nby the Earls of EGLINTON, occurring as far back as a seal of Earl HUGH,\r\nappended to a charter of 1598.\r\n\r\nThe Royal tressure had at least twice been granted as an augmentation to\r\nthe arms of foreigners. James V. granted it to Nicolas CANIVET of Dieppe,\r\nsecretary to JOHN, Duke of ALBANY (Reg. Mag. Sig., xxiv. 263, Oct. 24,\r\n1529). James VI. gave it to Sir JACOB VAN EIDEN, a Dutchman on whom he\r\nconferred the honour of knighthood.\r\n\r\nOn 12th March 1762, a Royal Warrant was granted directing Lyon to add a\r\n\"double tressure counterflowered as in the Royal arms of Scotland\" to the\r\narms of ARCHIBALD, Viscount PRIMROSE. Here the tressure was _gules_, as in\r\nthe Royal arms, although the field on which it was placed was _vert_. In a\r\nlater record of the arms of ARCHIBALD, Earl of ROSEBERY, in 1823, this\r\nheraldic anomaly was brought to an end, and the blazon of the arms of\r\nPrimrose is now: \"Vert, three primroses within a double tressure flory\r\ncounterflory or.\" (See Stodart, \"Scottish Arms,\" vol. i. pp. 262, 263,\r\nwhere mention is also made of an older {146} use of the Royal tressure or,\r\nby \"ARCHBALD PRIMROSE of Dalmenie, Knight and baronet, be his majesty\r\nCHARLES ii. create, _Vert, three primroses within a double tressure\r\nflowered counter-flowered or_.\") Another well-known Scottish instance in\r\nwhich the tressure occurs will be found in the arms of the Marquess of\r\nAilsa (Fig. 229).\r\n\r\nTwo instances are known in which the decoration of the tressure has\r\ndiffered from the usual conventional fleurs-de-lis. The tressure granted to\r\nCharles, Earl of Aboyne, has crescents without and demi-fleurs-de-lis\r\nwithin, and the tressure round the Gordon arms in the case of the Earls of\r\nAberdeen is of thistles, roses, and fleurs-de-lis alternately.\r\n\r\nThe tressure gives way to the chief and canton, but all other ordinaries\r\nare enclosed by the tressure, as will be seen from the arms of Lord Ailsa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 229.--Armorial bearings of Sir Archibald Kennedy,\r\nMarquess of Ailsa: Argent, a chevron gules between three cross crosslets\r\nfitchée sable, all within a double tressure flory and counter-flory of the\r\nsecond. Mantling gules, doubled ermine. Crest: upon a wreath of his\r\nliveries, a dolphin naiant proper. Supporters: two swans proper, beaked and\r\nmembered gules. Motto: \"Avise la fin.\" (From the painting by Mr. Graham\r\nJohnston in the Lyon Register.)]\r\n\r\nTHE LOZENGE, THE FUSIL, THE MASCLE, AND THE RUSTRE\r\n\r\nWhy these, which are simply varying forms of one charge, should ever have\r\nbeen included amongst the list of ordinaries is difficult to understand, as\r\nthey do not seem to be \"ordinaries\" any more than say the mullet or the\r\ncrescent. My own opinion is that they are no more than distinctively\r\nheraldic charges. The _lozenge_ (Fig. 230), which is the original form, is\r\nthe same shape as the \"diamond\" in a pack of cards, and will constantly be\r\nfound as a charge. In addition to this, the arms of a lady as maid, or as\r\nwidow, are always displayed upon a lozenge. Upon this point reference\r\nshould be made to the chapters upon marshalling. The arms of Kyrke show a\r\nsingle lozenge as the charge, but a single lozenge is very rarely met with.\r\nThe arms of Guise show seven lozenges conjoined. The arms of Barnes show\r\nfour lozenges conjoined in cross, and the arms of Bartlett show five\r\nlozenges conjoined in fess. Although the lozenge is very seldom found in\r\nEnglish armory as a single charge, nevertheless as a lozenge throughout\r\n(that is, with its four points touching the borders of the escutcheon) it\r\nwill be found in some number of instances in Continental heraldry, for\r\ninstance in the family of Eubing of Bavaria. An indefinite number of\r\nlozenges conjoined as a bend or a pale are known as a bend lozengy, or a\r\npale lozengy, but care should be taken in using this term, as it is\r\npossible for these ordinaries to be plain {147} ordinaries tinctured\r\n\"lozengy of two colours.\" The arms of Bolding are an example of a bend\r\nlozengy.\r\n\r\nThe _fusil_ is supposed to be, and is generally depicted, of a greater\r\nheight and less width than a lozenge, being an altogether narrower figure\r\n(Fig. 231). Though this distinction is generally observed, it is not always\r\neasy to decide which figure any emblazonment is intended to represent,\r\nunless the blazon of the arms in question is known. In many cases the\r\nvariations of different coats of arms, to suit or to fit the varying shapes\r\nof shields, have resulted in the use of lozenges and fusils indifferently.\r\nFusils occur in the historic arms of Daubeney, from which family Daubeney\r\nof Cote, near Bristol, is descended, being one of the few families who have\r\nan undoubted male descent from a companion of William the Conqueror. In the\r\nordinary way five or more lozenges in fess would be fusils, as in the arms\r\nof Percy, Duke of Northumberland, who bears in the first quarter: Azure,\r\nfive fusils conjoined in fess or. The charges in the arms of Montagu,\r\nthough only three in number, are always termed fusils. But obviously in\r\nearly times there could have been no distinction between the lozenge and\r\nthe fusil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 230.--Lozenge.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 231.--Fusil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 232.--Mascle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 233.--Rustre.]\r\n\r\nThe _mascle_ is a lozenge voided, _i.e._ only the outer framework is left,\r\nthe inner portion being removed (Fig. 232). Mascles have no particular or\r\nspecial meaning, but are frequently to be met with.\r\n\r\nThe blazon of the arms of De Quincy in Charles's Roll is: \"De goules poudré\r\na fause losengez dor,\" and in another Roll (MS. Brit. Mus. 29,796) the arms\r\nare described: \"De gules a set fauses lozenges de or\" (Fig. 234). The great\r\nSeiher de Quincy, Earl of Winchester, father of Roger, bore quite different\r\narms (Fig. 235). In 1472 Louis de Bruges, Lord of Gruthuyse, was created\r\nEarl of Winchester, having no relation to the De Quincy line. The arms of\r\nDe Bruges, or rather of Gruthuyse, were very different, yet nevertheless,\r\nwe find upon the Patent Roll (12 Edward IV. pt. 1, _m._ 11) a grant of the\r\nfollowing arms: \"Azure, dix mascles d'Or, enormé d'une canton de nostre\r\npropre Armes de Angleterre; cest a savoir de Gules a une Lipard passant\r\nd'Or, armée {148} d'Azure,\" to Louis, Earl of Winchester (Fig. 236). The\r\nrecurrence of the mascles in the arms of the successive Earls of\r\nWinchester, whilst each had other family arms, and in the arms of Ferrers,\r\nwhilst not being the original Ferrers coat, suggests the thought that there\r\nmay be hidden some reference to a common saintly patronage which all\r\nenjoyed, or some territorial honour common to the three of which the\r\nknowledge no longer remains with us.\r\n\r\nThere are some number of coats which are said to have had a field masculy.\r\nOf course this is quite possible, and the difference between a field\r\nmasculy and a field fretty is that in the latter the separate pieces of\r\nwhich it is composed interlace each other; but when the field is masculy it\r\nis all one fretwork surface, the field being visible through the voided\r\napertures. Nevertheless it seems by no means certain that in every case in\r\nwhich the field masculy occurs it may not be found in other, and possibly\r\nearlier, examples as fretty. At any rate, very few such coats of arms are\r\neven supposed to exist. The arms of De Burgh (Fig. 237) are blazoned in the\r\nGrimaldi Roll: \"Masclee de vêre and de goules,\" but whether the inference\r\nis that this blazon is wrong or that lozenge and mascle were identical\r\nterms I am not aware.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 234.--Arms of Roger de Quincy, Earl of Winchester (d.\r\n1264): Gules, seven mascles conjoined, three, three and one or. (From his\r\nseal.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 235.--Arms of Seiher de Quincy, Earl of Winchester (d.\r\n1219): Or, a fess gules, a label of seven points azure. (From his seal.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 236.--Arms of Louis de Bruges, Earl of Winchester (d.\r\n1492.)]\r\n\r\nThe _rustre_ is comparatively rare (Fig. 233). It is a lozenge pierced in\r\nthe centre with a circular hole. It occurs in the arms of J. D. G.\r\nDalrymple, Esq., F.S.A. Some few coats of arms are mentioned in Papworth in\r\nwhich the rustre appears; for example the arms of Pery, which are: \"Or,\r\nthree rustres sable;\" and Goodchief, which are: \"Per fess or and sable,\r\nthree rustres counterchanged;\" but so seldom is the figure met with that it\r\nmay be almost dropped out of consideration. How it ever reached the\r\nposition of being considered one of the ordinaries has always been to me a\r\nprofound mystery. {149}\r\n\r\nTHE FRET\r\n\r\nThe fret (Fig. 238), which is very frequently found occurring in British\r\narmory, is no doubt derived from earlier coats of arms, the whole field of\r\nwhich was covered by an interlacing of alternate bendlets and bendlets\r\nsinister, because many of the families who now bear a simple fret are found\r\nin earlier representations and in the early rolls of arms bearing coats\r\nwhich were fretty (Fig. 239). Instances of this kind will be found in the\r\narms of Maltravers, Verdon, Tollemache, and other families.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 237.--Arms of Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent (d. 1243).\r\n(From his seal.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 238.--The Fret.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 239.--Fretty.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 240.--Arms of John Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel (d.\r\n1435): Quarterly, 1 and 4, gules, a lion rampant or (for Fitz Alan); 2 and\r\n3, sable, fretty or (for Maltravers). (From his seal, _c._ 1432.)]\r\n\r\n\"Sable fretty or\" was the original form of the arms of the ancient and\r\nhistoric family of Maltravers. At a later date the arms of Maltravers are\r\nfound simply \"sable, a fret or,\" but, like the arms of so many other\r\nfamilies which we now find blazoned simply as charged with a fret, their\r\noriginal form was undoubtedly \"fretty.\" They appear fretty as late as in\r\nthe year 1421, which is the date at which the Garter plate of Sir William\r\nArundel, K.G. (1395-1400), was set up in St. George's Chapel at Windsor.\r\nHis arms as there displayed are in the first and fourth quarters, \"gules, a\r\nlion rampant or,\" and in the second and third, \"purpure fretty or\" for\r\nMaltravers. Probably the seal of John Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel (d. 1435),\r\nroughly marks the period, and shows the source of the confusion (Fig. 240).\r\nBut it should be noted that Sir Richard Arundel, Lord Maltravers, bore at\r\nthe siege of Rouen, in the year 1418, gules a lion rampant or, quarterly\r\nwith \"sable a fret or\" (for Maltravers). This would seem to indicate {150}\r\nthat those who treat the fret and fretty as interchangeable have good\r\ngrounds for so doing. A Sir John Maltravers bore \"sable fretty or\" at the\r\nsiege of Calais, and another Sir John Maltravers, a knight banneret, bore\r\nat the first Dunstable tournament \"sable fretty or, a label of three points\r\nargent.\" As he is there described as Le Fitz, the label was probably a\r\npurely temporary mark of difference. In a roll of arms which is believed to\r\nbelong to the latter part of the reign of Henry III., a Sir William\r\nMaltravers is credited with \"sable fretty or, on a quarter argent, three\r\nlions passant in pale gules.\" The palpable origin of the fret or fretty in\r\nthe case of the arms of Maltravers is simply the canting similarity between\r\na traverse and the name Maltravers. Another case, which starting fretty has\r\nended in a fret, occurs in the arms of the family of Harington. Sir John de\r\nHaverington, or Sir John de Harington, is found at the first Dunstable\r\ntournament in 1308 bearing \"sable fretty argent,\" and this coat of arms\r\nvariously differenced appears in some number of the other early rolls of\r\narms. The Harington family, as may be seen from the current baronetages,\r\nnow bear \"sable a fret argent,\" but there can be little doubt that in this\r\ncase the origin of the fretty is to be found in a representation of a\r\nherring-net.\r\n\r\nThe fret is usually depicted _throughout_ when borne singly, and is then\r\ncomposed of a bendlet dexter and a bendlet sinister, interlaced in the\r\ncentre by a mascle. Occasionally it will be found couped, but it is then,\r\nas a rule, only occupying the position of a subsidiary charge. A coat which\r\nis _fretty_ is entirely covered by the interlacing bendlets and bendlets\r\nsinister, no mascles being introduced.\r\n\r\nTHE FLAUNCH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 241.--Flaunches.]\r\n\r\nThe flaunch, which is never borne singly, and for which the additional\r\nnames of \"flasks\" and \"voiders\" are sometimes found, is the segment of a\r\ncircle of large diameter projecting into the field from either side of the\r\nescutcheon, of a different colour from the field. It is by no means an\r\nunusual charge to be met with, and, like the majority of other ordinaries,\r\nis subject to the usual lines of partition, but so subject is, however, of\r\nrather rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nPlanché, in his \"Pursuivant of Arms,\" mentions the old idea, which is\r\nrepeated by Woodward, \"that the base son of a noble woman, if he doe gev\r\narmes, must give upon the same a surcoat, but unless you do {151} well mark\r\nsuch coat you may take it for a coat flanchette.\" The surcoat is much the\r\nsame figure that would remain after flaunches had been taken from the field\r\nof a shield, with this exception, that the flaunches would be wider and the\r\nintervening space necessarily much narrower. In spite of the fact that this\r\nis supposed to be one of the recognised rules of armory, one instance only\r\nappears to be known of its employment, which, however, considering the\r\ncircumstances, is not very much to be wondered at. One exceptional case\r\nsurely cannot make a rule. I know of no modern case of a mother's coat\r\nbastardised--but I assume it would fall under the ordinary practice of the\r\nbordure wavy.\r\n\r\nTHE ROUNDLE\r\n\r\nThe roundle is a generic name which comprises all charges which are plain\r\ncircular figures of colour or metal. Foreign heraldry merely terms them\r\nroundles of such and such a colour, but in England we have special terms\r\nfor each tincture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 242.--Fountain.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 243.--The Arms of Stourton.]\r\n\r\nWhen the roundle is gold it is termed a \"bezant,\" when silver a \"plate,\"\r\nwhen gules a \"torteau,\" when azure a \"hurt,\" when sable an \"ogress,\"\r\n\"pellet,\" or \"gunstone,\" when vert a \"pomeis,\" when purpure a \"golpe,\" when\r\ntenné an \"orange,\" when sanguine a \"guze.\" The golpes, oranges, and guzes\r\nare seldom, if ever, met with, but the others are of constant occurrence,\r\nand roundles of fur are by no means unknown. A roundle of more than one\r\ncolour is described as a roundle \"per pale,\" for example of gules and\r\nazure, or whatever it may be. The plates and bezants are naturally flat,\r\nand must be so represented. They should never be shaded up into a globular\r\nform. The torteau is sometimes found shaded, but is more correctly flat,\r\nbut probably the pellet or ogress and the pomeis are intended to be\r\nglobular. Roundles of fur are always flat. One curious roundle is a very\r\ncommon charge in British armory, that is, the \"fountain,\" which is a\r\nroundle barry wavy argent and azure (Fig. 242). This is the conventional\r\nheraldic representation of water, of course. A fountain will be found\r\ntermed a \"syke\" when occurring in the arms of any family of the name of\r\nSykes. It {152} typifies naturally anything in the nature of a well, in\r\nwhich meaning it occurs on the arms of Stourton (Fig. 243).\r\n\r\nThe arms of Stourton are one of the few really ancient coats concerning\r\nwhich a genuine explanation exists. The blazon of them is: Sable a bend or,\r\nbetween six fountains proper. Concerning this coat of arms Aubrey says: \"I\r\nbelieve anciently 'twas only Sable a bend or.\" With all deference to\r\nAubrey, I personally neither think he was right, nor do I pay much\r\nattention to his _opinions_, particularly in this case, inasmuch as every\r\nknown record of the Stourton arms introduces the six fountains. The name\r\nStourton, originally \"de Stourton,\" is emphatically a territorial name, and\r\nthere is little opportunity for this being gainsaid, inasmuch as the\r\nlordship and manor of Stourton, in the counties of Wilts and Somerset,\r\nremained in the possession of the Lords Stourton until the year 1714. The\r\npresent Lord Mowbray and Stourton still owns land within the parish.\r\nConsequently there is no doubt whatever that the Lords Stourton derived\r\ntheir surname from this manor of Stourton. Equally is it certain that the\r\nmanor of Stourton obtained its name from the river Stour, which rises\r\nwithin the manor. The sources of the river Stour are six wells, which exist\r\nin a tiny valley in Stourton Park, which to this day is known by the name\r\nof \"The Six Wells Bottom.\" In the present year of grace only one of the six\r\nwells remains visible. When Sir Richard Colt Hoare wrote, there were four\r\nvisible. Of these four, three were outside and one inside the park wall.\r\nThe other two within the park had been then closed up. When Leland wrote in\r\n1540 to 1542, the six wells were in existence and visible; for he wrote:\r\n\"The ryver of Stoure risith ther of six fountaynes or springes, whereof 3\r\nbe on the northe side of the Parke, harde withyn the Pale, the other 3 be\r\nnorth also, but withoute the Parke. The Lorde Stourton giveth these 6\r\nfountaynes yn his Armes.\" Guillim says the same thing: \"These six Fountains\r\nare borne in signification of six Springs, whereof the River of Sture in\r\nWiltshire hath his beginning, and passeth along to Sturton, the seat of\r\nthat Barony.\" Here, then, is the origin of the six fountains upon the coat\r\nof arms; but Aubrey remarks that three of the six springs in the park are\r\nin the county of Wilts, whereas Mr. Camden has put them all in\r\nSomersetshire. However, the fact is that three of the springs were inside\r\nthe park and three outside, and that three were in Wiltshire and three in\r\nSomersetshire. Here, then, is to be found the division upon the coat of\r\narms of the six fountains in the two sets of three each, and it is by no\r\nmeans an improbable suggestion that the bend which separates the three from\r\nthe three is typical of, or was suggested by, either the park wall or pale,\r\nor by the line of division between the two counties, and the more probable\r\nof the two seems to {153} be the park wall. The coat of arms is just a map\r\nof the property. Now, with regard to the arms, as far as is known there has\r\nnot been at any time the slightest deviation by the family of the Lords\r\nStourton from the coat quoted and illustrated. But before leaving the\r\nsubject it may be well to point out that in the few cases in which an\r\nancient coat of arms carries with it an explanation, such explanation is\r\nusually to be found either in some such manner as that in which these arms\r\nof Stourton have been explained, or else in some palpable pun, and not in\r\nthe mythical accounts and legends of supernatural occurrences which have\r\nbeen handed down, and seldom indeed in any explanation of personal nobility\r\nwhich the tinctures or charges are sometimes said to represent.\r\n\r\nWhat is now considered quite a different charge from the fountain is the\r\nwhirlpool or gurges, which is likewise intended to represent water, and is\r\nborne by a family of the name of Gorges, the design occupying the whole of\r\nthe field. This is represented by a spiral line of azure commencing in the\r\ncentre of an argent field, continuing round and round until the edges of\r\nthe shield are reached; but there can be very little doubt that this was an\r\nearly form of representing the watery roundle which happens to have been\r\nperpetuated in the instance of that one coat. The fountains upon the seal\r\nof the first Lord Stourton are represented in this manner.\r\n\r\nExamples of a field semé of roundles are very usual, these being termed\r\nbezanté or platé if semé of bezants or plates; but in the cases of roundles\r\nof other colours the words \"semé of\" need to be used.\r\n\r\nTHE ANNULET\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 244.--Annulet.]\r\n\r\nClosely akin to the roundel is the annulet (Fig. 244) and though, as far as\r\nI am aware, no text-book has as yet included this in its list of ordinaries\r\nand sub-ordinaries, one can see no reason, as the annulet is a regularly\r\nused heraldic figure, why the lozenge should have been included and the\r\nannulet excluded, when the annulet is of quite as frequent occurrence. It\r\nis, as its name implies, simply a plain ring of metal or colour, as will be\r\nfound in the arms of Lowther, Hutton, and many other families. Annulets\r\nappear anciently to have been termed false roundles.\r\n\r\nAnnulets will frequently be found interlaced. {154} Care should be taken to\r\ndistinguish them from gem-rings, which are always drawn in a very natural\r\nmanner with stones, which, however, in real life would approach an\r\nimpossible size.\r\n\r\nTHE LABEL\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 245.--The Label.]\r\n\r\nThe label (Fig. 245) as a charge must be distinguished from the label as a\r\nmark of difference for the eldest son, though there is no doubt that in\r\nthose cases in which it now exists as a charge, the origin must be traced\r\nto its earlier use as a difference. Concerning its use as a mark of\r\ndifference it will be treated of further in the chapter upon marks of\r\ndifference and cadency, but as a charge it will seldom be found in any\r\nposition except in chief, and not often of other than three points, and it\r\nwill always be found drawn throughout, that is, with the upper line\r\nextended to the size of the field. It consists of a narrow band straight\r\nacross the shield, from which depend at right angles three short bands.\r\nThese shorter arms have each of late years been drawn more in the shape of\r\na dovetail, but this was not the case until a comparatively recent period,\r\nand now-a-days we are quite as inclined to revert to the old forms as to\r\nperpetuate this modern variety. Other names for the label are the \"lambel\"\r\nand the \"file.\" The label is the only mark of difference now borne by the\r\nRoyal Family. Every member of the Royal Family has the Royal arms assigned\r\nto him for use presumably during life, and in these warrants, which are\r\nseparate and personal for each individual, both the coronet and the\r\ndifference marks which are to be borne upon the label are quoted and\r\nassigned. This use of the label, however, will be subsequently fully dealt\r\nwith. As a charge, the label occurs in the arms of Barrington: \"Argent,\r\nthree chevronels gules, a label azure;\" and Babington: \"Argent, ten\r\ntorteaux, four, three, two, and one, in chief a label of three points\r\nazure;\" also in the earlier form of the arms of De Quincy (Fig. 235) and\r\nCourtenay (Fig. 246). Various curious coats of arms in which the label\r\nappears are given in Papworth as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"... a label of four points in bend sinister ... Wm. de Curli, 20th\r\n    Hen. III. (Cotton, Julius F., vii. 175.)\r\n\r\n    \"Argent, a label of five points azure. Henlington, co. Gloucester.\r\n    (Harl. MS. 1404, fo. 109.)\r\n\r\n    \"Or, a file gules, with three bells pendent azure, clappers sable.\r\n    (Belfile.) {155}\r\n\r\n    \"Sable, three crescents, in chief a label of two drops and in fess\r\n    another of one drop argent. Fitz-Simons. (Harl. MS. 1441 and 5866.)\r\n\r\n    \"Or, three files borne barways gules, the first having five points, the\r\n    second four, and the last three. Liskirke, Holland. (Gwillim.)\"\r\n\r\nA curious label will have been noticed in the arms of De Valence (Fig.\r\n120).\r\n\r\nTHE BILLET\r\n\r\nThe billet (Fig. 247), though not often met with as a charge, does\r\nsometimes occur, as for example, in the arms of Alington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 246.--Arms of Hugh Courtenay, Earl of Devon (d. 1422):\r\nOr, three torteaux, a label azure. (From his seal.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 247.--The Billet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 248.--Billetté.]\r\n\r\nIts more frequent appearance is as an object with which a field or superior\r\ncharge is semé, in which case these are termed billetté (Fig. 248). The\r\nbest known instance of this is probably the coat borne on an inescutcheon\r\nover the arms of England during the joint reign of William and Mary. The\r\narms of Gasceline afford another example of a field billetté. These are\r\n\"or, billetté azure, and a label gules.\" Though not many instances are\r\ngiven under each subdivision, Papworth affords examples of coats with every\r\nnumber of billets from 1 to 20, but many of them, particularly some of\r\nthose from 10 to 20 in number, are merely mistaken renderings of fields\r\nwhich should have been termed billetté. The billet, slightly widened, is\r\nsometimes known as a block, and as such will be found in the arms of\r\nPaynter. Other instances are to be found where the billets are termed\r\ndelves or gads. The billet will sometimes be found pointed at the bottom,\r\nin which case it is termed \"urdy at the foot.\" But neither as a form of\r\nsemé, nor as a charge, is the billet of sufficiently frequent use to\r\nwarrant its inclusion as one of the ordinaries or sub-ordinaries. {156}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 249.--Armorial bearings of R. E. Yerburgh, Esq.: Per\r\npale argent and azure, on a chevron between three chaplets all\r\ncounterchanged, an annulet for difference. Mantling azure and argent.\r\nCrest: on a wreath of the colours, a falcon close or, belled of the last,\r\npreying upon a mallard proper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 250.--Armorial bearings of Robert Berry, Esq.:\r\nQuarterly, 1 and 4, vert, a cross crosslet argent (for Berry); 2 and 3,\r\nparted per pale argent and sable, on a chaplet four mullets counterchanged\r\n(for Nairne), in the centre of the quarters a crescent or, for difference.\r\nMantling vert, doubled argent. Crest: upon a wreath of his liveries, a\r\ndemi-lion rampant gules, armed and langued, holding in his dexter paw a\r\ncross crosslet fitchée azure; and in an escroll over the same this motto,\r\n\"In hoc signo vinces,\" and in another under the shield, \"L'espérance me\r\ncomforte.\"]\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPLET\r\n\r\nWhy the chaplet was ever included amongst the ordinaries and sub-ordinaries\r\npasses my comprehension. It is not of frequent occurrence, and I have yet\r\nto ascertain in which form it has acquired this status. The chaplet which\r\nis usually meant when the term is employed is the garland of oak, laurel,\r\nor other leaves or flowers (Fig. 249), which is found more frequently as\r\npart of a crest. There is also the chaplet, which it is difficult to\r\ndescribe, save as a large broad annulet {157} such as the one which figures\r\nin the arms of Nairne (Fig. 250), and which is charged at four regular\r\nintervals with roses, mullets, or some other objects.\r\n\r\nThe chaplet of oak and acorns is sometimes known as a civic crown, but the\r\nterm chaplet will more frequently be found giving place to the use of the\r\nword wreath, and a chaplet of laurel or roses, unless completely conjoined\r\nand figuring as a charge upon the shield, will be far more likely to be\r\ntermed a wreath or garland of laurel or roses than a chaplet.\r\n\r\nThere are many other charges which have no great distinction from some of\r\nthese which have been enumerated, but as nobody hitherto has classed them\r\nas ordinaries I suppose there could be no excuse for so introducing them,\r\nbut the division of any heraldic charges into ordinaries and\r\nsub-ordinaries, and their separation from other figures, seems to a certain\r\nextent incomprehensible and very unnecessary. {158}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE HUMAN FIGURE IN HERALDRY\r\n\r\nIf we include the many instances of the human head and the human figure\r\nwhich exist as crests, and also the human figure as a supporter, probably\r\nit or its parts will be nearly as frequently met with in armory as the\r\nlion; but if crests and supporters be disregarded, and the human figure be\r\nsimply considered as a charge upon the shield, it is by no means often to\r\nbe met with.\r\n\r\nEnglish (but not Scottish) official heraldry now and for a long time past\r\nhas set its face against the representation of any specific saint or other\r\nperson in armorial bearings. In many cases, however, particularly in the\r\narms of ecclesiastical sees and towns, the armorial bearings registered are\r\nsimply the conventionalised heraldic representation of seal designs dating\r\nfrom a very much earlier period.\r\n\r\nSeal engravers laboured under no such limitations, and their\r\nrepresentations were usually of some specific saint or person readily\r\nrecognisable from accompanying objects. Consequently, if it be desirable,\r\nthe identity of a figure in a coat of arms can often be traced in such\r\ncases by reference to a seal of early date, whilst all the time the\r\nofficial coat of arms goes no further than to term the figure that of a\r\nsaint.\r\n\r\nThe only representation which will be found in British heraldry of the\r\nDeity is in the arms of the See of Chichester, which certainly originally\r\nrepresented our Lord seated in glory. Whether by intention or carelessness,\r\nthis, however, is now represented and blazoned as: \"Azure, a Prester\r\n[Presbyter] John sitting on a tombstone, in his left hand a mound, his\r\nright hand extended all or, with a linen mitre on his head, and in his\r\nmouth a sword proper.\" Possibly it is a corruption, but I am rather\r\ninclined to think it is an intentional alteration to avoid the necessity of\r\nany attempt to pictorially represent the Deity.\r\n\r\nChrist upon the Cross, however, will be found represented in the arms of\r\nInverness (Fig. 251). The shield used by the town of Halifax has the\r\ncanting \"Holy Face\" upon a chequy field. This coat, however, is without\r\nauthority, though it is sufficiently remarkable to quote the blazon in\r\nfull: \"Chequy or and azure, a man's face with long hair and bearded and\r\ndropping blood, and surmounted {159} by a halo, all proper; in chief the\r\nletters HALEZ, and in base the letters FAX.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 251.--Armorial bearings of the Royal Burgh of\r\nInverness: Gules, our Lord upon the Cross proper. Mantling gules, doubled\r\nor. Crest: upon a wreath of the proper liveries a cornucopia proper.\r\nSupporters: dexter, a dromedary; sinister, an elephant, both proper. (From\r\na painting by Mr. Graham Johnston in Lyon Register.)]\r\n\r\nNo other instance is known, but, on the other hand, representations of the\r\nVirgin Mary with her babe are not uncommon. She will be found so described\r\nin the arms of the Royal Burgh of Banff. The Virgin Mary and Child appear\r\nalso in the arms of the town of Leith, {160} viz.: \"Argent, in a sea\r\nproper, an ancient galley with two masts, sails furled sable, flagged\r\ngules, seated therein the Virgin Mary with the Infant Saviour in her arms,\r\nand a cloud resting over their heads, all also proper.\"\r\n\r\nThe Virgin and Child appear in the crest of Marylebone (Fig. 252), but in\r\nthis case, in accordance with the modern English practice, the identity is\r\nnot alluded to. The true derivation of the name from \"St. Mary le Bourne\"\r\n(and not \"le bon\") is perpetuated in the design of the arms.\r\n\r\nA demi-figure of the Virgin is the crest of Rutherglen;[12] and the Virgin\r\nand Child figure, amongst other ecclesiastical arms, on the shields of the\r\nSees of Lincoln [\"Gules, two lions passant-guardant or; on a chief azure,\r\nthe Holy Virgin and Child, sitting crowned, and bearing a sceptre of the\r\nsecond\"], Salisbury [\"Azure, the Holy Virgin and Child, with sceptre in her\r\nleft hand all or\"], Sodor and Man [\"Argent, upon three ascents the Holy\r\nVirgin standing with her arms extended between two pillars, on the dexter\r\nwhereof is a church; in base the ancient arms of Man upon an\r\ninescutcheon\"], Southwell [\"Sable, three fountains proper, a chief paly of\r\nthree, on the first or, a stag couchant proper, on the second gules, the\r\nVirgin holding in her arms the infant Jesus, on the third also or, two\r\nstaves raguly couped in cross vert\"], and Tuam [\"Azure, three figures erect\r\nunder as many canopies or stalls of Gothic work or, their faces, hands, and\r\nlegs proper; the first representing an archbishop in his pontificals; the\r\nsecond the Holy Virgin Mary, a circle of glory over her head, holding in\r\nher left arm the infant Jesus; and the third an angel having his dexter arm\r\nelevated, and under the sinister arm a lamb, all of the second\"]. {161}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 252.--Arms of Marylebone: Per chevron sable and barry\r\nwavy of six, argent and azure in chief, in the dexter a fleur-de-lis, and\r\nin the sinister a rose, both or. Crest: on a wreath of the colours, upon\r\ntwo bars wavy argent and azure, between as many lilies of the first,\r\nstalked and leaved vert, a female figure affronté proper, vested of the\r\nfirst, mantled of the second, on the left arm a child also proper, vested\r\nor, around the head of each a halo of the last. Motto: \"Fiat secundum\r\nverbum tuum.\"]\r\n\r\n{162} Various saints figure in different Scottish coats of arms, and\r\namongst them will be found the following:--\r\n\r\nSt. Andrew, in the arms of the National Bank of Scotland, granted in 1826\r\n[\"Or, the image of St. Andrew with vesture vert and surcoat purpure bearing\r\nbefore him the cross of his martyrdom argent, all resting on a base of the\r\nsecond, in the dexter flank a garb gules, in the sinister a ship in full\r\nsail sable, the shield surrounded with two thistles proper, disposed in\r\norle\"]; St. Britius, in the arms of the Royal Burgh of Kirkcaldy [\"Azur,\r\nane abbay of three pyramids argent, each ensigned with a cross patée or.\r\nAnd on the reverse of the seal is insculped in a field azure the figure of\r\nSt. Bryse with long garments, on his head a mytre, in the dexter a\r\nfleur-de-lis, the sinister laid upon his breast all proper. Standing in ye\r\nporch of the church or abbay. Ensigned on the top as before all betwixt a\r\ndecrescent and a star in fess or. The motto is 'Vigilando Munio.' And round\r\nthe escutcheon of both sydes these words--'Sigillum civitatus Kirkaldie'\"];\r\nSt. Columba, in the arms of the College of the Holy Spirit at Cumbræ\r\n[\"Quarterly, 1 and 4 grand quarters, azure, St. Columba in a boat at sea,\r\nin his sinister hand a dove, and in the dexter chief a blazing star all\r\nproper; 2 and 3 grand quarters, quarterly, i. and iv., argent, an eagle\r\ndisplayed with two heads gules; ii. and iii., parted per bend embattled\r\ngules and argent; over the second and third grand quarters an escutcheon of\r\nthe arms of Boyle of Kelburne, viz. or, three stags' horns gules\"]; St.\r\nDuthacus, in the arms of the Royal Burgh of Tain [\"Gules, St. Duthacus in\r\nlong garments argent, holding in his dexter hand a staff garnished with\r\nivy, in the sinister laid on his breast a book expanded proper\"]; St.\r\nÆgidius (St. Giles), in the arms of the Royal Burgh of Elgin [\"Argent,\r\nSanctus Ægidius habited in his robes and mitred, holding in his dexter hand\r\na pastoral staff, and in his left hand a clasped book, all proper.\r\nSupporters; two angels proper, winged or volant upwards. Motto: 'Sic itur\r\nad astra,' upon ane compartment suitabil to a Burgh Royal, and for their\r\ncolours red and white\"]; St. Ninian, in the arms of the Episcopal See of\r\nGalloway [\"Argent, St. Ninian standing and full-faced proper, clothed with\r\na pontifical robe purple, on his head a mitre, and in his dexter hand a\r\ncrosier or\"]; and St. Adrian, in the arms of the town of Pittenweem [\"Azur,\r\nin the sea a gallie with her oars in action argent, and therein standing\r\nthe figure of St. Adrian, with long garments close girt, and a mytre on his\r\nhead proper, holding in his sinister hand a crosier or. On the stern a flag\r\ndeveloped argent, charged with the Royall Armes of Scotland, with this\r\nword, 'Deo Duce'\"].\r\n\r\nBiblical characters of the Old Testament have found favour upon the\r\nContinent, and the instances quoted by Woodward are too amusing to omit:--\r\n\r\n\"The families who bear the names of saints, such as ST. ANDREW, ST. GEORGE,\r\nST. MICHAEL, have (perhaps not unnaturally) included in their arms\r\nrepresentation of their family patrons.\r\n\r\n\"The Bavarian family of REIDER include in their shield the mounted effigy\r\nof the good knight ST. MARTIN dividing his cloak with a beggar (date of\r\ndiploma 1760). The figure of the great Apostle of the Gentiles appears in\r\nthe arms of VON PAULI JOERG, and JORGER, of Austria, similarly make use of\r\nSt. George.\r\n\r\n\"Continental Heraldry affords not a few examples of the use of the\r\npersonages of Holy Writ. The ADAMOLI of Lombardy bear: 'Azure, {163} the\r\nTree of Life entwined with the Serpent, and accosted with our first\r\nparents, all proper' (_i.e._ in a state of nature). The addition of a chief\r\nof the Empire to this coat makes it somewhat incongruous.\r\n\r\n\"The family of ADAM in Bavaria improve on Sacred History by eliminating\r\nEVE, and by representing ADAM as holding the apple in one hand, and the\r\nserpent wriggling in the other. On the other hand, the Spanish family of\r\nEVA apparently consider there is a sufficiently transparent allusion to\r\ntheir own name, and to the mother of mankind, in the simple bearings: 'Or,\r\non a mount in base an apple-tree vert, fructed of the field, and encircled\r\nby a serpent of the second.'\r\n\r\n\"The family of ABEL in Bavaria make the patriarch in the attitude of prayer\r\nto serve as their crest; while the coat itself is: 'Sable, on a square\r\naltar argent, a lamb lying surrounded by fire and smoke proper.'\r\n\r\n\"SAMSON slaying the lion is the subject of the arms of the VESENTINA family\r\nof Verona. The field is gules, and on a terrace in base vert the strong man\r\nnaked bestrides a golden lion and forces its jaws apart. The Polish family\r\nof SAMSON naturally use the same device, but the field is azure and the\r\npatriarch is decently habited. The STARCKENS of the Island of OESEL also\r\nuse the like as _armes parlantes_; the field in this case is or. After\r\nthese we are hardly surprised to find that Daniel in the lions' den is the\r\nsubject of the arms of the Rhenish family of DANIELS, granted late in the\r\neighteenth century; the field is azure. The Bolognese DANIELS are content\r\nto make a less evident allusion to the prophet; their arms are: \"per fess\r\nazure and vert, in chief 'the lion of the tribe of Judah' naissant or,\r\nholding an open book with the words 'LIBRI APERTI SUNT' (DANIEL vii. 10).\r\n\r\n\"The Archangel ST. MICHAEL in full armour, as conventionally represented,\r\ntreading beneath his feet the great adversary, sable, is the charge on an\r\nazure field of the VAN SCHOREL of Antwerp.\"\r\n\r\nOther instances will be found, as St. Kentigern (who is sometimes said to\r\nbe the same as St. Mungo), and who occurs as the crest of Glasgow: \"The\r\nhalf-length figure of St. Kentigern affronté, vested and mitred, his right\r\nhand raised in the act of benediction, and having in his left hand a\r\ncrosier, all proper;\" St. Michael, in the arms of Linlithgow: \"Azure, the\r\nfigure of the Archangel Michael, with wings expanded, treading on the belly\r\nof a serpent lying with its tail nowed fesswise in base, all argent, the\r\nhead of which he is piercing through with a spear in his dexter hand, and\r\ngrasping with his sinister an escutcheon charged with the Royal Arms of\r\nScotland.\" The same saint also figures in the arms of the city of Brussels;\r\nwhile the family of MITCHELL-CARRUTHERS bears as a crest: \"St. Michael in\r\narmour, {164} holding a spear in his dexter hand, the face, neck, arms and\r\nlegs bare, all proper, the wings argent, and hair auburn.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Martin occurs in the arms of Dover, and he also figures, as has been\r\nalready stated, on the shield of the Bavarian family of REIDER, whilst St.\r\nPaul occurs as a charge in the arms of the Dutch family of VON PAULI.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the See of Clogher are: \"A Bishop in pontifical robes seated on\r\nhis chair of state, and leaning towards the sinister, his left hand\r\nsupporting a crosier, his right pointing to the dexter chief, all or, the\r\nfeet upon a cushion gules, tasselled or.\"\r\n\r\nA curious crest will be found belonging to the arms of a family of Stewart,\r\nwhich is: \"A king in his robes, crowned.\" The arms of the Episcopal See of\r\nRoss afford another instance of a bishop, together with St. Boniface.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the town of Queensferry, in Scotland, show an instance of a\r\nqueen. \"A king in his robes, and crowned,\" will be found in the arms of\r\nDartmouth [\"Gules, the base barry wavy, argent and azure, thereon the hulk\r\nof a ship, in the centre of which is a king robed and crowned, and holding\r\nin his sinister hand a sceptre, at each end of the ship a lion sejant\r\nguardant all or].\"\r\n\r\nAllegorical figures, though numerous as supporters, are comparatively rare\r\nas charges upon a shield; but the arms of the University of Melbourne show\r\na representation of the figure of Victory [\"Azure, a figure intended to\r\nrepresent Victory, robed and attired proper, the dexter hand extended\r\nholding a wreath of laurel or, between four stars of eight points, two in\r\npale and two in fess argent\"], which also appears in other coats of arms.\r\n\r\nThe figure of Truth will be found in the coats of arms for various members\r\nof the family of Sandeman.\r\n\r\nThe bust of Queen Elizabeth was granted by that Queen, as a special mark of\r\nher Royal favour, to Sir Anthony Weldon, her Clerk of the Spicery.\r\n\r\nApollo is represented in the arms of the Apothecaries' Company: \"Azure,\r\nApollo, the inventor of physic, proper, with his head radiant, holding in\r\nhis left hand a bow and in his right hand an arrow or, supplanting a\r\nserpent argent.\"\r\n\r\nThe figure of Justice appears in the arms of Wiergman [or Wergman].\r\n\r\nNeptune appears in the arms granted to Sir Isaac Heard, Lancaster Herald,\r\nafterwards Garter King of Arms, and is again to be found in the crest of\r\nthe arms of Monneypenny [\"On a dolphin embowed, a bridled Neptune astride,\r\nholding with his sinister hand a trident over his shoulder\"].\r\n\r\nThe figure of Temperance occurs in the crest of Goodfellow. {165}\r\n\r\nThe head of St. John the Baptist in a charger figures in the crest of the\r\nTallow Chandlers' Livery Company and in the arms of Ayr, whilst the head of\r\nSt. Denis is the charge upon the arms of a family of that name.\r\n\r\nAngels, though very frequently met with as supporters, are far from being\r\nusual, either as a charge upon a shield or as a crest. The crest of Leslie,\r\nhowever, is an angel.\r\n\r\nThe crest of Lord Kintore is an angel in a praying posture or, within an\r\norle of laurel proper.\r\n\r\nCherubs are far more frequently to be met with. They are represented in\r\nvarious forms, and will be found in the arms of Chaloner, Thackeray,\r\nMaddocks, and in the crest of Carruthers.\r\n\r\nThe nude figure is perhaps the most usual form in which the human being is\r\nmade use of as a charge, and examples will be found in the arms of Wood\r\n(Lord Halifax), and in the arms of Oswald.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Dalziell show an example--practically unique in British\r\nheraldry--of a naked man, the earliest entry (1685) of the arms of Dalziell\r\nof Binns (a cadet of the family) in the Lyon Register, having them then\r\nblazoned: \"Sable, a naked man with his arms extended _au naturel_, on a\r\ncanton argent, a sword and pistol disposed in saltire proper.\"\r\n\r\nThis curious coat of arms has been the subject of much speculation. The\r\nfact that in some early examples the body is swinging from a gibbet has led\r\nsome to suppose the arms to be an allusion to the fact, or legend, that one\r\nof the family recovered the body of Kenneth III., who had suffered death by\r\nhanging at the hands of the Picts. But it seems more likely that if the\r\ngibbet is found in any authoritative versions of the arms possibly the coat\r\nmay owe its origin to a similar reason to that which is said, and probably\r\ncorrectly, to account for the curious crest of the Davenport family, viz.:\r\n\"A man's head in profile couped at the shoulders proper, about the neck a\r\nrope or,\" or as it is sometimes termed, \"a felon's head proper, about the\r\nneck a halter or.\" There is now in the possession of the Capesthorne branch\r\nof the Davenport family a long and very ancient roll, containing the names\r\nof the master robbers captured and beheaded in the times of Koran, Roger,\r\nand Thomas de Davenport, and probably the Davenport family held some office\r\nor Royal Commission which empowered them to deal in a summary way with the\r\noutlaws which infested the Peak country. It is more than probable that the\r\ncrest of Davenport should be traced to some such source as this, and I\r\nsuggest the possibility of a similar origin for the arms of Dalziel.\r\n\r\nAs a crest the savage and demi-savage are constantly occurring. {166} They\r\nare in heraldry distinguished by the garlands of leaves about either or\r\nboth loins and temples.\r\n\r\nMen in armour are sometimes met with. The arms of O'Loghlen are an instance\r\nin point, as are the crests of Marshall, Morse, Bannerman, and Seton of\r\nMounie.\r\n\r\nFigures of all nationalities and in all costumes will be found in the form\r\nof supporters, and occasionally as crests, but it is difficult to classify\r\nthem, and it must suffice to mention a few curious examples. The human\r\nfigure as a supporter is fully dealt with in the chapter devoted to that\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Jedburgh have a mounted warrior, and the same device occurs in\r\nthe crest of the Duke of Fife, and in the arms of Lanigan-O'Keefe.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Londonderry afford an instance of a skeleton.\r\n\r\nThe emblematical figure of Fortune is a very favourite charge in foreign\r\nheraldry.\r\n\r\nA family of the name of Rodd use the Colossus of Rhodes as a crest: and the\r\narms of Sir William Dunn, Bart., are worth the passing mention [\"Azure, on\r\na mount in base a bale of wool proper, thereon seated a female figure\r\nrepresenting Commerce, vested argent, resting the dexter hand on a stock of\r\nan anchor, and in the sinister a caduceus, both or, on the chief of the\r\nlast a tree eradicated, thereon hanging a hunting-horn between a thistle\r\nslipped proper on the dexter and a fleur-de-lis azure on the sinister.\r\nCrest: a cornucopia fesswise, surmounted by a dexter hand couped proper,\r\nholding a key in bend sinister or. Motto: 'Vigilans et audax.'\"].\r\n\r\nThe crests of Vivian [\"A demi-hussar of the 18th Regiment, holding in his\r\nright hand a sabre, and in his left a pennon flying to the sinister gules,\r\nand inscribed in gold letters, 'Croix d'Orade,' issuant from a bridge of\r\none arch, embattled, and at each end a tower\"], and Macgregor [\"two brass\r\nguns in saltire in front of a demi-Highlander armed with his broadsword,\r\npistols, and with a target, thereon the family arms of Macgregor,\" viz.:\r\n\"Argent: a sword in bend dexter azure, and an oak-tree eradicated in bend\r\nsinister proper, in the dexter chief an antique crown gules, and upon an\r\nescroll surmounting the crest the motto, 'E'en do and spare not'\"] are\r\ntypical of many crests of augmentation and quasi-augmentation granted in\r\nthe early part of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the Devonshire family of Arscot [\"A demi-man affronté in a\r\nTurkish habit, brandishing in his dexter hand a scimitar, and his sinister\r\nhand resting on a tiger's head issuing from the wreath\"] is curious, as is\r\nthe crest granted by Sir William Le Neve in 1642 to Sir Robert Minshull,\r\nviz.: \"A Turk kneeling on one knee, habited {167} gules, legs and arms in\r\nmail proper, at the side a scymitar sable, hilted or, on the head a turban\r\nwith a crescent and feather argent, holding in the dexter hand a crescent\r\nof the last.\"\r\n\r\nThe crest of Pilkington [\"a mower with his scythe in front habited as\r\nfollows: a high-crowned hat with flap, the crown party per pale, flap the\r\nsame, counterchanged; coat buttoned to the middle, with his scythe in bend\r\nproper, habited through quarterly and counterchanged argent and gules\"],\r\nand the very similar crest of De Trafford, in which the man holds a flail,\r\nare curious, and are the subjects of appropriate legends.\r\n\r\nThe crest of Clerk of Pennycuick (a demi-man winding a horn) refers to the\r\ncurious tenure by which the Pennycuick estate is supposed to be held,\r\nnamely, that whenever the sovereign sets foot thereupon, the proprietor\r\nmust blow a horn from a certain rocky point. The motto, \"Free for a blast,\"\r\nhas reference to the same.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, I fancy, afford the only\r\ninstance of what is presumably a corpse, the blazon being: \"Azure, a man\r\n(human body) fesswise between a dexter hand having an eye on the palm\r\nissuing out of a cloud downward and a castle situate on a rock proper,\r\nwithin a bordure or charged with several instruments peculiar to the art\r\n(_sic_); on a canton of the first a saltire argent surmounted of a thistle\r\nvert, crowned of the third.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we come to parts of the human body instances of heads, arms, and legs\r\nare legion.\r\n\r\nThere are certain well-known heraldic heads, and though many instances\r\noccur where the blazon is simply a \"man's head,\" it will be most frequently\r\nfound that it is more specifically described.\r\n\r\nSloane Evans in his \"Grammar of Heraldry\" specifies eight different\r\nvarieties, namely: 1. The wild man's; 2. The Moor's; 3. The Saracen's; 4.\r\nThe Saxon's; 5. The Englishman's; 6. The old man's; 7. The woman's; 8. The\r\nchild's.\r\n\r\nThe wild man's or savage's head is usually represented with a wreath of\r\nleaves about the temples, but not necessarily so (Fig. 253).\r\n\r\nThe head of the Moor, or \"blackamoor,\" as it is more usually described, is\r\nalmost always in profile, and very frequently adorned with a twisted wreath\r\n(torse) about the temples (Fig. 254).\r\n\r\nThe head of the Saracen is also usually found with wreaths about the\r\ntemples (Fig. 255).\r\n\r\nThe head of the Saxon is borne by several Welsh families, and is supposed\r\nto be known by the absence of a beard.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman's head, which is borne by the Welsh family of Lloyd of\r\nPlymog, has no very distinctive features, except that whilst the hair and\r\nbeard of the savage are generally represented brown, they {168} are black\r\nin the case of the Moor and Saracen, and fair for the Saxon and Englishman.\r\n\r\nThe old man's head, which, like that of the Saxon and Englishman, is seldom\r\nmet with, is bald and grey-haired and bearded.\r\n\r\nBut for all practical purposes these varieties may be all disregarded\r\nexcept the savage's (Fig. 253), the blackamoor's (Fig. 254), and the\r\nSaracen's (Fig. 255). Examples of the savage's head will be found in the\r\narms of Eddington of Balbartan [\"Azure, three savages' heads couped\r\nargent\"], in the arms of Gladstone, and in the canting coat of Rochead of\r\nWhitsonhill [\"Argent, a savage's head erased, distilling drops of blood\r\nproper, between three combs azure\"]. Moir of Otterburn bears the Moors'\r\nheads [\"Argent, three negroes' heads couped proper within a bordure\r\ncounter-indented sable and or\"], and Moir of Stonniwood matriculated a\r\nsomewhat similar coat in which the heads are termed Mauritanian [\"Argent,\r\nthree Mauritanian negroes' heads couped and distilling guttés-de-sang\"].\r\nAlderson of Homerton, Middlesex, bears Saracens' heads [\"Argent, three\r\nSaracens' heads affronté, couped at the shoulders proper, wreathed about\r\nthe temples of the first and sable\"].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 253.--A savage's head.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 254.--A blackamoor's head.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 255.--A Saracen's head.]\r\n\r\nThe woman's head (Fig. 256) in heraldry is always represented young and\r\nbeautiful (that is, if the artist is capable of so drawing it), and it is\r\nalmost invariably found with golden hair. The colour, however, should be\r\nblazoned, the term \"crined\" being used. Five maidens' heads appear upon the\r\narms of the town of Reading, and the crest of Thornhill shows the same\r\nfigure. The arms of the Mercers' Livery Company [\"Gules, a demi-virgin\r\ncouped below the shoulders, issuing from clouds all proper, vested or,\r\ncrowned with an Eastern crown of the last, her hair dishevelled, and\r\nwreathed round the temples with roses of the second, all within an orle of\r\nclouds proper\"] and of the Master of the Revels in Scotland [\"Argent, a\r\nlady rising out of a cloud in the nombril point, richly apparelled, on her\r\nhead a garland of ivy, holding in her right hand a poinziard crowned, in\r\nher left a vizard all proper, standing {169} under a veil or canopy azure,\r\ngarnished or, in base a thistle vert\"] are worthy of quotation.\r\n\r\nThe boy's head will seldom be found except in Welsh coats, of which the\r\narms of Vaughan and Price are examples.\r\n\r\nAnother case in which the heads of children appear are the arms of\r\nFauntleroy [\"Gules, three infants' heads couped at the shoulders proper,\r\ncrined or\"], which are a very telling instance of a canting device upon the\r\noriginal form of the name, which was \"Enfantleroy.\"\r\n\r\nChildren, it may be here noted, are seldom met with in armory, but\r\ninstances will be found in the arms of Davies, of Marsh, co. Salop [\"Sable,\r\na goat argent, attired or, standing on a child proper swaddled gules, and\r\nfeeding on a tree vert\"], of the Foundling Hospital [\"Per fesse azure and\r\nvert, in chief a crescent argent, between two mullets of six points or, in\r\nbase an infant exposed, stretching out its arms for help proper\"], and in\r\nthe familiar \"bird and bantling\" crest of Stanley, Earls of Derby. Arms and\r\nhands are constantly met with, and have certain terms of their own. A hand\r\nshould be stated to be either dexter (Fig. 257), or sinister (Fig. 258),\r\nand is usually blazoned and always understood to be couped at the wrist. If\r\nthe hand is open and the palm visible it is \"apaumé\" (Figs. 257 and 258),\r\nbut this being by far the most usual position in which the hand is met\r\nwith, unless represented to be holding anything, the term \"apaumé\" is not\r\noften used in blazon, that position being presumed unless anything contrary\r\nis stated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 256.--A woman's head and bust.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 257.--A dexter hand.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 258.--A sinister hand.]\r\n\r\nThe hand is occasionally represented \"clenched,\" as in the arms and crest\r\nof Fraser-Mackintosh. When the thumb and first two fingers are raised, they\r\nare said to be \"raised in benediction\" (Fig. 259).\r\n\r\nThe cubit arm (Fig. 260), should be carefully distinguished from the arm\r\ncouped at the elbow (Fig. 261). The former includes only about two-thirds\r\nof the entire arm from the elbow. The form \"couped at the elbow\" is not\r\nfrequently met with.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole arm from the shoulder is used, it is always bent at {170}\r\nthe elbow, and this is signified by the term \"embowed,\" and an arm embowed\r\nnecessarily includes the whole arm. Fig. 262 shows the usual position of an\r\narm embowed, but it is sometimes placed embowed to the dexter (Fig. 263),\r\nupon the point of the elbow, that is, \"embowed fesseways\" (Fig. 264), and\r\nalso, but still more infrequently, resting on the upper arm (Fig. 265).\r\nEither of the latter positions must be specified in the blazon. Two arms\r\n\"counter-embowed\" occur in many crests (Figs. 266 and 267).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 259.--A hand \"in benediction.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 260.--A cubit arm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 261.--An arm couped at the elbow.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 262.--An arm embowed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 263.--An arm embowed to the dexter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 264.--An arm embowed fesseways.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 265.--An arm embowed the upper part in fesse.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 266.--Two arms counter-embowed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 267.--Two arms counter-embowed and interlaced.]\r\n\r\nWhen the arm is bare it is termed \"proper.\" When clothed it is termed\r\neither \"vested\" or \"habited\" (Fig. 268). The cuff is very {171} frequently\r\nof a different colour, and the crest is then also termed \"cuffed.\" The hand\r\nis nearly always bare, but if not represented of flesh colour it will be\r\npresumed and termed to be \"gloved\" of such and such a tincture. When it is\r\nrepresented in armour it is termed \"in armour\" or \"vambraced\" (Fig. 269).\r\nEven when in armour the hand is usually bare, but if in a gauntlet this\r\nmust be specifically so stated (Fig. 270). The armour is always represented\r\nas riveted _plate_ armour unless it is specifically stated to be _chain\r\narmour_, as in the crest of Bathurst, or _scale armour_. Armour is\r\nsometimes decorated with gold, when the usual term employed will be\r\n\"garnished or,\" though occasionally the word \"purfled\" is used.\r\n\r\nGloves are occasionally met with as charges, _e.g._ in the arms of\r\nBarttelot. Gauntlets will be found in the arms of Vane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 268.--A cubit arm habited.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 269.--An arm embowed in armour.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 270.--A cubit arm in armour, the hand in a gauntlet.]\r\n\r\nLegs are not so frequently met with as arms. They will be found, however,\r\nin the arms of the Isle of Man and the families Gillman, Bower, Legg, and\r\nas the crest of Eyre. Boots will be found in the crests of various families\r\nof the name of Hussey.\r\n\r\nBones occur in the arms of Scott-Gatty and Baines.\r\n\r\nA skull occurs in the crest of Græme [\"Two arms issuing from a cloud\r\nerected and lighting up a man's skull encircled with two branches of palm,\r\nover the head a marquess's coronet, all proper\"].\r\n\r\nA woman's breast occurs in the canting arms of Dodge (Plate VI.) [\"Barry of\r\nsix or and sable, on a pale gules, a woman's breast distilling drops of\r\nmilk proper. Crest: upon a wreath of the colours, a demi sea-dog azure,\r\ncollared, maned, and finned or\"].\r\n\r\nAn eye occurs in the crest of Blount of Maple-Durham [\"On a wreath of the\r\ncolours, the sun in splendour charged in the centre with an eye all\r\nproper\"].\r\n\r\nThe man-lion, the merman, mermaid, melusine, satyr, satyral, harpy, sphinx,\r\ncentaur, sagitarius, and weirwolf are included in the chapter upon mythical\r\nanimals. {172}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE HERALDIC LION\r\n\r\nHeraldic art without the lion would not amount to very much, for no figure\r\nplays such an important or such an extensive part in armory as the lion, in\r\none or other of its various positions. These present-day positions are the\r\nresults of modern differentiation, arising from the necessity of a larger\r\nnumber of varying coats of arms; but there can be little doubt that in\r\nearly times the majority of these positions did not exist, having been\r\ngradually evolved, and that originally the heraldic animal was just \"a\r\nlion.\" The shape of the shield was largely a governing factor in the manner\r\nin which we find it depicted; the old artists, with a keener artistic sense\r\nthan is evidenced in so many later examples of heraldic design, endeavoured\r\nto fill up as large a proportion of the space available as was possible,\r\nand consequently when only one lion was to be depicted upon the shield they\r\nvery naturally drew the animal in an upright position, this being the one\r\nmost convenient and adaptable for their purpose. Probably their knowledge\r\nof natural history was very limited, and this upright position would seem\r\nto them the most natural, and probably was the only one they knew; at any\r\nrate, at first it is almost the only position to be found. A curious\r\ncommentary upon this may be deduced from the head-covering of Geoffrey of\r\nAnjou (Fig. 28), which shows a lion. This lion is identically of the form\r\nand shape of the lions rampant upon the shield, but from the nature of the\r\nspace it occupies, is what would now be termed statant; but there is at the\r\nsame time no such alteration in the relative position of the limbs as would\r\nnow be required. This would seem to indicate very clearly that there was\r\nbut the one stereotyped pattern of a lion, which answered all their\r\npurposes, and that our fore-runners applied that one pattern to the spaces\r\nthey desired to decorate.\r\n\r\nEarly heraldry, however, when the various positions came into recognised\r\nuse, soon sought to impose this definite distinction, that the lion could\r\nonly be depicted erect in the _rampant_ position, and that an animal\r\nrepresented to be walking must therefore be a _leopard_ from the very\r\nposition which it occupied. This, however, was a distinction known only to\r\nthe more pedantic heralds, and found greatest favour {173} amongst the\r\nFrench; but we find in Glover's Roll, which is a copy of a roll originally\r\ndrawn up about the year 1250, that whilst he gives lions to six of the\r\nEnglish earls, he commences with \"le Roy d'Angleterre porte, Gules, trois\r\nlupards d'or.\" On the other hand, the monkish chronicler John of\r\nHarmoustier in Touraine (a contemporary writer) relates that when Henry I.\r\nchose Geoffrey, son of Foulk, Earl of Anjou, Touraine, and Main, to be his\r\nson-in-law, by marrying him to his only daughter and heir, Maud the\r\nEmpress, and made him knight; after the bathing and other solemnities\r\n(pedes ejus solutaribus in superficie Leonculos aureos habentibus\r\nmuniuntur), boots embroidered with golden lions were drawn on his legs, and\r\nalso that (Clypeus Leonculos aureos imaginarios habens collo ejus\r\nsuspenditur) a shield with lions of gold therein was hung about his neck.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, evident that the refinement of distinction between a lion\r\nand a leopard was not of the beginning; it is a later addition to the\r\nearlier simple term of lion. This distinction having been invented by\r\nFrench heralds, and we taking so much of our heraldry, our language, and\r\nour customs from France, adopted, and to a certain extent used, this\r\ndescription of lions passant as \"leopards.\" There can be no doubt, however,\r\nthat the lions passant guardant upon the English shield have always been\r\nrepresented as _lions_, no matter what they may have been called, and the\r\nuse of the term leopard in heraldry to signify a certain position for the\r\nlion never received any extensive sanction, and has long since become\r\nobsolete in British armory. In French blazon, however, the old distinction\r\nis still observed, and it is curious to observe that on the coins of the\r\nChannel Islands the shield of arms distinctly shows three leopards. The\r\nFrench lion is our lion rampant, the French leopard is our lion passant\r\nguardant, whilst they term our lion passant a _léopard-lionné_, and our\r\nlion rampant guardant is their _lion-léopardé_.\r\n\r\nA lion rampant and any other beast of prey is usually represented in\r\nheraldry with the tongue and claws of a different colour from the animal.\r\nIf it is not itself gules, its tongue and claws are usually represented as\r\nof that colour, unless the lion be on a field of gules. They are then\r\nrepresented azure, the term being \"armed and langued\" of such and such a\r\ncolour. It is not necessary to mention that a lion is \"armed and langued\"\r\nin the blazon when tongue and claws are emblazoned in gules, but whenever\r\nany other colour is introduced for the purpose it is better that it should\r\nbe specified. Outside British heraldry a lion is always supposed to be\r\nrampant unless otherwise specifically described. The earliest appearance of\r\nthe lions in the arms of any member of the Royal Family in England would\r\nappear to be the seal of King John when he was Prince and before he {174}\r\nascended the throne. This seal shows his arms to be two lions passant. The\r\nEnglish Royal crest, which originated with Richard I., is now always\r\ndepicted as a lion statant guardant. There can be no doubt, however, that\r\nthis guardant attitude is a subsequent derivation from the position of the\r\nlions on the shield, when heraldry was ceasing to be actual and becoming\r\nsolely pictorial. We find in the case of the crest of Edward the Black\r\nPrince, now suspended over his tomb in Canterbury Cathedral, that the lion\r\nupon the chapeau looks straight forward over the front of the helm (see\r\nFig. 271).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 272.]\r\n\r\nAnother ancient rule belonging to the same period as the controversy\r\nbetween leopards and lions was that there cannot be more than _one lion_\r\nupon a shield, and this was one of the great arguments used to determine\r\nthat the charges on the Royal Arms of England must be leopards and not\r\nlions. It was admitted as a rule of British armory to a limited extent,\r\nviz., that when two or more lions rampant appeared upon the same shield,\r\nunless combatant, they were always formerly described as lioncels. Thus the\r\narms of Bohun are: \"Azure, a bend argent, cottised between six lioncels\r\nrampant or.\" British heraldry has, however, long since disregarded any such\r\nrule (if any definite rule ever really existed upon the point), though\r\ncuriously enough in the recent grant of arms to the town of Warrington the\r\nanimals are there blazoned six \"lioncels.\"\r\n\r\nThe artistic evolution of the lion rampant can be readily traced in the\r\nexamples and explanations which follow, but, as will be understood, the\r\nemployment in the case of some of these models cannot strictly be said to\r\nbe confined within a certain number of years, though the details and\r\nperiods given are roughly accurate, and sufficiently so to typify the\r\nchanges which have occurred.\r\n\r\nUntil perhaps the second half of the thirteenth century the body of the\r\nlion appears straight upright, so that the head, the trunk, and the left\r\nhind-paw fall into the angle of the shield. The left fore-paw is\r\nhorizontal, the right fore- and the right hind-paw are placed diagonally\r\n(or obliquely) upwards (Fig. 272). The paws each end in three knobs,\r\nsimilar to a clover-leaf, out of which the claws come forth. The fourth or\r\ninferior toes appeared in heraldry somewhat later. The jaws are closed or\r\nonly very slightly opened, without the tongue being visible. The tail is\r\nthickened in the middle with a bunch of longer hair and is turned down\r\ntowards the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 271.--Shield, helmet, and crest of Edward the Black\r\nPrince, suspended over his tomb in Canterbury Cathedral.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 273.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the period lasting from the second half of the thirteenth\r\nto the second half of the fourteenth centuries, the right hind-paw sinks\r\nlower until it forms a right angle with the left. The mouth {175} grows\r\npointed, and in the second half of the period the tongue becomes visible.\r\nThe tail also shows a knot near its root (Fig. 273).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 274.]\r\n\r\nIn examples taken from the second half of the fourteenth century and the\r\nfifteenth century the lion's body is no longer placed like a pillar, but\r\nlays its head back to the left so that the right fore-paw falls into an\r\noblique upward line with the trunk. The toes are lengthened, appearing\r\nalmost as fingers, and spread out from one another; the tail, adorned with\r\nflame-like bunches of hair, strikes outwards and loses the before-mentioned\r\nknot, which only remains visible in a forked tail (_queue-fourché_). The\r\njaws grow deep and are widely opened, and the breast rises and expands\r\nunder the lower jaw (Fig. 274).\r\n\r\nLions of peculiar virility and beauty appear upon a fourteenth-century\r\nbanner which shows the arms of the family of Talbot, Earls of Shrewsbury:\r\nGules, a lion rampant within a bordure engrailed or, quartered with the\r\narms of _Strange_: Argent, two lions passant in pale gules, armed and\r\nlangued azure. Fig. 275 gives the lower half of the banner which was\r\npublished in colours in the Catalogue of the Heraldic Exhibition in London,\r\n1894.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 275.--Arms of Strange and Talbot. (From a design for a\r\nbanner.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 276.]\r\n\r\nFig. 276 is an Italian coat of arms of the fourteenth century, and shows a\r\nlion of almost exactly the same design, except the paws are {176} here\r\nrendered somewhat more heraldically. The painting (azure, a lion rampant\r\nargent) served as an \"Ex libris,\" and bears the inscription \"Libe\r\naccusacionum mey p. he ...\" (The remainder has been cut away. It is\r\nreproduced from Warnecke's \"German Bookplates,\" 1890.)\r\n\r\nWhen we come to modern examples of lions, it is evident that the artists of\r\nthe present day very largely copy lions which are really the creations of,\r\nor adaptations from, the work of their predecessors. The lions of the late\r\nMr. Forbes Nixon, as shown in Fig. 277, which were specially drawn by him\r\nat my request as typical of his style, are respectively as follows:--\r\n\r\nA winged lion passant coward. A lion rampant regardant. A lion rampant\r\nqueue-fourché. A lion passant crowned. A lion passant. A lion rampant. A\r\nlion rampant to the sinister. A lion passant guardant, ducally gorged. A\r\nlion statant guardant, ducally crowned. A lion rampant. A lion statant\r\nguardant. A lion sejant guardant erect. Lions drawn by Mr. Scruby will be\r\nfound in Figs. 278 and 279, which are respectively: \"Argent, a lion rampant\r\nsable,\" \"Sable, a lion passant guardant argent,\" and \"Sable, a lion rampant\r\nargent.\" These again were specially drawn by Mr. Scruby as typical of his\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nThe lions of Mr. Eve would seem to be entirely original. Their singularly\r\ngraceful form and proportions are perhaps best shown by Figs. 280 and 281,\r\nwhich are taken from his book \"Decorative Heraldry.\"\r\n\r\nThe lions of Mr. Graham Johnston can be appreciated from the examples in\r\nFigs. 284-9.\r\n\r\nExamples of lions drawn by Miss Helard will be found in Figs. 282, 283.\r\n\r\nThe various positions which modern heraldry has evolved for the lions,\r\ntogether with the terms of blazon used to describe these positions, are as\r\nfollows, and the differences can best be appreciated from a series drawn by\r\nthe same artist, in this case Mr. Graham Johnston:--\r\n\r\n_Lion rampant._--The animal is here depicted in profile, and erect, resting\r\nupon its sinister hind-paw (see Fig. 284). {177}\r\n\r\n_Lion rampant guardant._--In this case the head of the lion is turned to\r\nface the spectator (Fig. 285).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 277.--Lions. (Drawn by Mr. J. Forbes Nixon.)]\r\n\r\n_Lion rampant regardant._--In this case the head is turned completely\r\nround, looking backwards (Fig. 286).\r\n\r\n_Lion rampant, double-queued._--In this case the lion is represented as\r\n{178} having two tails (Fig. 287). These must both be apparent from the\r\nbase of the tail, otherwise confusion will arise with the next example.\r\n\r\n_Lion rampant queue-fourché._--In this case one tail springs from the base,\r\nwhich is divided or \"forked\" in the centre (Fig. 288). There is no doubt\r\nthat whilst in modern times and with regard to modern arms this distinction\r\nmust be adhered to, anciently queue-fourché and double-queued were\r\ninterchangeable terms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 278.--Lion passant guardant. (By Mr. G. Scruby.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 279.--Lion rampant. (By Mr. G. Scruby.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 280.--Lion rampant and lion statant guardant, by Mr. G.\r\nW. Eve.

(From \"Decorative Heraldry.\")]\r\n\r\n_Lion rampant tail nowed._--The tail is here tied in a knot (Fig. 289). It\r\nis not a term very frequently met with.\r\n\r\n_Lion rampant tail elevated and turned over its head._--The only instances\r\nof the existence of this curious variation (Fig. 290) which have come under\r\nmy own notice occur in the coats of two families of the name {179} of\r\nBuxton, the one being obviously a modern grant founded upon the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 282.--A lion rampant. (By Miss Helard.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 283.--A lion rampant. (By Miss Helard.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 284.--Lion rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 285.--Lion rampant guardant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 286.--Lion rampant regardant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 287.--Lion rampant double queued.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 288.--Lion rampant queue-fourché.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 289.--Lion rampant, tail nowed.]\r\n\r\n_Lion rampant with two heads._--This occurs (Fig. 291) in the coat of arms,\r\nprobably founded on an earlier instance, granted in 1739 to {180} Mason of\r\nGreenwich, the arms being: \"Per fess ermine and azure, a lion rampant with\r\ntwo heads counterchanged.\" This curious charge had been adopted by Mason's\r\nCollege in Birmingham, and on the foundation of Birmingham University it\r\nwas incorporated in its arms.\r\n\r\n_Lion rampant guardant bicorporated._--In this case the lion has one head\r\nand two bodies. An instance of this curious creature occurs in the arms of\r\nAttewater, but I am not aware of any modern instance of its use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 290.--Lion rampant, tail elevated and turned over its\r\nhead.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 291.--Lion rampant, with two heads.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 292.--Tricorporate lion.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 293.--Lion coward.]\r\n\r\n_Lion Rampant Tricorporate._--In this case three bodies are united in one\r\nhead (Fig. 292). Both this and the preceding variety are most unusual, but\r\nthe tricorporate lion occurs in a coat of arms (_temp._ Car. II.)\r\nregistered in Ulster's Office: \"Or, a tricorporate lion rampant, the bodies\r\ndisposed in the dexter and sinister chief points and in base, all meeting\r\nin one head guardant in the fess point sable.\"\r\n\r\n_Lion coward._--In this case the tail of the lion is depressed, passing\r\nbetween its hind legs (Fig. 293). The exactitude of this term is to some\r\nextent modern. Though a lion cowarded was known in ancient days, there can\r\nbe no doubt that formerly an artist felt himself quite at liberty to put\r\nthe tail between the legs if this seemed artistically desirable, without\r\nnecessarily having interfered with the arms by so doing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 294.--Armorial bearings of Alexander Charles Richards\r\nMaitland, Esq.: Or, a lion rampant gules, couped in all his joints of the\r\nfield, within a double tressure flory and counterflory azure, a bordure\r\nengrailed ermine.

Motto: \"Consilio et animis.\"]\r\n\r\n_Lion couped in all its joints_ is a charge which seems peculiar to the\r\nfamily of Maitland, and it would be interesting to learn to what source its\r\norigin can be traced. It is represented with each of its four paws, its\r\nhead and its tail severed from the body, and removed slightly away\r\ntherefrom. A Maitland coat of arms exhibiting this peculiarity will be\r\nfound in Fig. 294. {181}\r\n\r\n_Lions rampant combatant_ are so termed when two are depicted in one shield\r\nfacing each other in the attitude of fighting (Fig. 295).\r\n\r\nA very curious and unique instance of a lion rampant occurs in the arms of\r\nWilliams (matriculated in Lyon Register in 1862, as the second and third\r\nquarterings of the arms of Sir James Williams Drummond of Hawthornden,\r\nBt.), the coat in question being: Argent, a lion rampant, the body sable,\r\nthe head, paws, and tuft of the tail of the field.\r\n\r\n_Lion passant._--A lion in this position (Fig. 296) is represented in the\r\nact of walking, the dexter forepaw being raised, but all three others being\r\nupon the ground.\r\n\r\n_Lion passant guardant._--This (Fig. 297) is the same as the previous\r\nposition, except that the head is turned to face the spectator. The lions\r\nin the quartering for England in the Royal coat of arms are \"three lions\r\npassant guardant in pale.\"\r\n\r\n_Lion of England._--This is \"a lion passant guardant or,\" and the term is\r\nonly employed for a lion of this description when it occurs as or in an\r\nhonourable augmentation, then being usually represented on a field of\r\ngules. A lion passant guardant or, is now never granted to any applicant\r\nexcept under a specific Royal Warrant to that effect. It occurs in many\r\naugmentations, _e.g._ Wolfe, Camperdown, and many others; and when three\r\nlions passant guardant in pale or upon a canton gules are granted, as in\r\nthe arms of Lane (Plate II.), the augmentation is termed a \"canton of\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\n_Lion passant regardant_ is as the lion passant, but with the head turned\r\nright round looking behind (Fig. 298). A lion is not often met with in this\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n_Lions passant dimidiated._--A curious survival of the ancient but now\r\n{182} obsolete practice of dimidiation is found in the arms of several\r\nEnglish seaport towns. Doubtless all can be traced to the \"so-called\" arms\r\nof the \"Cinque Ports,\" which show three lions passant guardant dimidiated\r\nwith the hulks of three ships. There can be no doubt whatever that this\r\noriginally came from the dimidiation of two separate coats, viz. the Royal\r\nArms of England (the three lions passant guardant), and the other \"azure,\r\nthree ships argent,\" typical of the Cinque Ports, referring perhaps to the\r\nprotection of the coasts for which they were liable, or possibly merely to\r\ntheir seaboard position. Whilst Sandwich[13] uses the two separate coats\r\nsimply dimidiated upon one shield, the arms of Hastings[14] vary slightly,\r\nbeing: \"Party per pale gules and azure, a lion passant guardant or, between\r\nin chief and in base a lion passant guardant of the last dimidiated with\r\nthe hulk of a ship argent.\" From long usage we have grown accustomed to\r\nconsider these two conjoined and dimidiated figures as one figure (Fig.\r\n299), and in the recent grant of arms to Ramsgate[15] a figure of this kind\r\nwas granted as a simple charge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 295.--Two lions rampant combatant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 296.--Lion passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 297.--Lion passant guardant.]\r\n\r\nThe arms of Yarmouth[16] afford another instance of a resulting figure of\r\nthis class, the three lions passant guardant of England being here\r\ndimidiated with as many herrings naiant.\r\n\r\n_Lion statant._--The distinction between a lion passant and a lion statant\r\nis that the lion statant has all four paws resting upon the {183} ground.\r\nThe two forepaws are usually placed together (Fig. 300). Whilst but seldom\r\nmet with as a charge upon a shield, the lion statant is by no means rare as\r\na crest.\r\n\r\n_Lion statant tail extended._--This term is a curious and, seemingly, a\r\npurposeless refinement, resulting from the perpetuation in certain cases of\r\none particular method of depicting the crest--originally when a crest a\r\nlion was always so drawn--but it cannot be overlooked, because in the\r\ncrests of both Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, and Percy, Duke of\r\nNorthumberland, the crest is now stereotyped as a lion in this form (Fig.\r\n301) upon a chapeau.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 298.--Lion passant regardant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 299.--Lion passant guard. dimidiated with the hulk of a\r\nship.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 300.--Lion statant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 301.--Lion statant tail extended.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 302.--Lion statant guardant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 303.--Lion salient.]\r\n\r\n_Lion statant guardant_ (Fig. 302).--This (crowned) is of course the Royal\r\ncrest of England, and examples of it will be found in the arms of the\r\nSovereign and other descendants, legitimate and illegitimate, of Sovereigns\r\nof this country. An exceptionally fine rendering of it occurs in the\r\nWindsor Castle Bookplates executed by Mr. G. W. Eve.\r\n\r\n_Lion salient._--This, which is a very rare position for a lion, represents\r\nit in the act of springing, the _two_ hind legs being on the ground, the\r\nothers in the air (Fig. 303). {184}\r\n\r\n_Lion salient guardant._--There is no reason why the lion salient may not\r\nbe guardant or regardant, though an instance of the use of either does not\r\ncome readily to mind.\r\n\r\n_Lion sejant._--Very great laxity is found in the terms applied to lions\r\nsejant, consequently care is necessary to distinguish the various forms.\r\nThe true lion sejant is represented in profile, seated on its haunches,\r\nwith the forepaws resting on the ground (Fig. 304).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 304.--Lion sejant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 305.--Lion sejant guardant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 306.--Lion sejant regardant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 307.--Lion sejant erect.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 308.--Lion sejant guardant erect.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 309.--Lion sejant regardant erect.]\r\n\r\n_Lion sejant guardant._--This is as the foregoing, but with the face (only)\r\nturned to the spectator (Fig. 305).\r\n\r\n_Lion sejant regardant._--In this the head is turned right back to gaze\r\nbehind (Fig. 306).\r\n\r\n_Lion sejant erect_ (or, as it is sometimes not very happily termed,\r\nsejant-rampant).--In this position the lion is sitting upon its haunches,\r\nbut the body is erect, and it has its forepaws raised in the air (Fig.\r\n307).\r\n\r\n_Lion sejant guardant erect_ is as the last figure, but the head faces the\r\nspectator (Fig. 308).\r\n\r\n_Lion sejant regardant erect_ is as the foregoing, but with the head turned\r\nright round to look backwards (Fig. 309).\r\n\r\n_Lion sejant affronté._--In this case the lion is seated on its haunches,\r\n{185} but _the whole body_ is turned to face the spectator, the forepaws\r\nresting upon the ground in front of its body. Ugly as this position is, and\r\nimpossible as it might seem, it certainly is to be found in some of the\r\nearly rolls.\r\n\r\n_Lion sejant erect affronté_ (Fig. 294).--This position is by no means\r\nunusual in Scotland. A lion sejant erect and affronté, &c., is the Royal\r\ncrest of Scotland, and it will also be found in the arms of Lyon Office.\r\n\r\nA good representation of the lion sejant affronté and erect is shown in\r\nFig. 310, which is taken from Jost Amman's _Wappen und Stammbuch_ (1589).\r\nIt represents the arms of the celebrated Lansquenet Captain Sebastian\r\nSchärtlin (Schertel) von Burtenbach [\"Gules, a lion sejant affronté erect,\r\ndouble-queued, holding in its dexter paw a key argent and in its sinister a\r\nfleur-de-lis\"]. His victorious assault on Rome in 1527, and his striking\r\nsuccesses against France in 1532, are strikingly typified in these arms,\r\nwhich were granted in 1534.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 310.--Arms of Sebastian Schärtlin von Burtenbach.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 311.--Lion couchant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 312.--Lion dormant.]\r\n\r\n_Lion Couchant._--In this position the lion is represented lying down, but\r\nthe head is erect and alert (Fig. 311).\r\n\r\n_Lion dormant._--A lion dormant is in much the same position as a lion\r\ncouchant, except that the eyes are closed, and the head rests upon the\r\nextended forepaws (Fig. 312). Lions dormant are seldom met with, but they\r\noccur in the arms of Lloyd, of Stockton Hall, near York.\r\n\r\n_Lion morné._--This is a lion without teeth and claws, but no instance of\r\nthe use of the term would appear to exist in British armory. Woodward\r\nmentions amongst other Continental examples the arms of the old French\r\nfamily of De Mornay [\"Fascé d'argent et de gueules au lion morné de sable,\r\ncouronné d'or brochant sur le tout\"].\r\n\r\n_Lions as supporters._--Refer to the chapter on Supporters.\r\n\r\n_Winged lion._--The winged lion--usually known as the lion of St. Mark--is\r\nnot infrequently met with. It will be found both passant {186} and sejant,\r\nbut more frequently the latter (Fig. 313). The true lion of St. Mark (that\r\nis, when used as a badge for sacred purposes to typify St. Mark) has a\r\nhalo. Winged lions are the supporters of Lord Braye.\r\n\r\n_Sea lion_ (or, to use another name for it, a _morse_) is the head,\r\nforepaws, and upper part of a lion conjoined to the tail of a fish. The\r\nmost frequent form in which sea lions appear are as supporters, but they\r\nare also met with as crests and charges. When placed horizontally they are\r\ntermed naiant. Sea lions, however, will also be found \"sejant\" and\r\n\"sejant-erect\" (Fig. 314). When issuing from waves of the sea they are\r\ntermed \"assurgeant.\"\r\n\r\n_Lion-dragon._--One hesitates to believe that this creature has any\r\nexistence outside heraldry books, where it is stated to be of similar form\r\nand construction to the sea lion, the difference being that the lower half\r\nis the body and tail of a wyvern. I know of no actual arms or crest in\r\nwhich it figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 313.--Winged lion.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 314.--Sea lion.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 315.--Man-Lion.]\r\n\r\n_Man-lion_ or _man-tiger_.--This is as a lion but with a human face. Two of\r\nthese are the supporters of Lord Huntingdon, and one was granted to the\r\nlate Lord Donington as a supporter, whilst as charges they also occur in\r\nthe arms of Radford. This semi-human animal is sometimes termed a \"lympago\"\r\n(Fig. 315).\r\n\r\n_Other terms relating to lions_ occur in many heraldic works--both old and\r\nnew--but their use is very limited, if indeed of some, any example at all\r\ncould be found in British armory. In addition to this, whilst the fact may\r\nsometimes exist, the _term_ has never been adopted or officially\r\nrecognised. Personally I believe most of the terms which follow may for all\r\npractical purposes be entirely disregarded. Amongst such terms are\r\n_contourné_, applied to a lion passant or rampant to the sinister. It\r\nwould, however, be found blazoned in these words and not as contourné.\r\n\"Dismembered,\" \"Demembré,\" \"Dechaussée,\" and \"Trononnée\" are all\r\n\"heraldry-book\" terms specified to mean the same as \"couped in all its\r\njoints,\" but the uselessness and uncertainty concerning these terms is\r\nexemplified by the fact that the {187} same books state \"dismembered\" or\r\n\"demembré\" to mean (when applied to a lion) that the animal is shown\r\nwithout legs or tail. The term \"embrued\" is sometimes applied to a lion to\r\nsignify that its mouth is bloody and dropping blood; and \"vulned\" signifies\r\nwounded, heraldically represented by a blotch of gules, from which drops of\r\nblood are falling. A lion \"disarmed\" is without teeth, tongue, or claws.\r\n\r\nA term often found in relation to lions rampant, but by no means peculiar\r\nthereto, is \"debruised.\" This is used when it is partly defaced by another\r\ncharge (usually an ordinary) being placed over it.\r\n\r\nAnother of these guide-book terms is \"decollated,\" which is said to be\r\nemployed in the case of a lion which has its head cut off. A lion \"defamed\"\r\nor \"diffamed\" is supposed to be rampant to the sinister but looking\r\nbackwards, the supposition being that the animal is being (against his\r\nwill) chased off the field with infamy. A lion \"evire\" is supposed to be\r\nemasculated and without signs of sex. In this respect it is interesting to\r\nnote that in earlier days, before mock modesty and prudery had become such\r\nprominent features of our national life, the genital organ was always\r\nrepresented of a pronounced size in a prominent position, and it was as\r\nmuch a matter of course to paint it gules as it now is to depict the tongue\r\nof that colour. To prevent error I had better add that this is not now the\r\nusual practice.\r\n\r\nLions placed back to back are termed \"endorsed\" or \"addorsed,\" but when two\r\nlions passant in pale are represented, one passing to the dexter and one to\r\nthe sinister, they are termed \"counter-passant.\" This term is, however,\r\nalso used sometimes when they are merely passant towards each other. A more\r\ncorrect description in such cases would be passant \"respecting\" or\r\n\"regarding\" each other.\r\n\r\nThe term _lionné_ is one stated to be used with animals other than lions\r\nwhen placed in a rampant position. Whilst doubtless of regular acceptation\r\nin French heraldry as applied to a leopard, it is unknown in English, and\r\nthe term rampant is indifferently applied; _e.g._ in the case of a leopard,\r\nwolf, or tiger when in the rampant position.\r\n\r\n_Lionced_ is a term seldom met with, but it is said to be applied (for\r\nexample to a cross) when the arms end in lions' heads. I have yet to find\r\nan authentic example of the use of such a cross.\r\n\r\nWhen a bend or other ordinary issues from the mouths of lions (or other\r\nanimals), the heads issuing from the edges or angles of the escutcheon, the\r\nordinary is said to be \"engouled.\"\r\n\r\nA curious term, of the use of which I know only one example, is \"fleshed\"\r\nor \"flayed.\" This, as doubtless will be readily surmised, means that the\r\nskin is removed, leaving the flesh gules. This was the method by which the\r\nsupporters of Wurtemburg were \"differenced\" for the Duke of Teck, the\r\nforepaws being \"fleshed.\" {188}\r\n\r\nWoodward gives the following very curious instances of the lion in\r\nheraldry:--\r\n\r\n\"Only a single example of the use of the lioness as a heraldic charge is\r\nknown to me. The family of COING, in Lorraine, bears: d'Azure, à une lionne\r\narrêtée d'or.\r\n\r\n\"The following fourteenth-century examples of the use of the lion as a\r\nheraldic charge are taken from the oft-quoted _Wappenrolle von Zurich_, and\r\nshould be of interest to the student of early armory:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"51: END: Azure, a lion rampant-guardant argent, its feet or.\r\n\r\n\"305. WILDENVELS: Per pale argent and sable, in the first a demi-lion\r\nstatant-guardant issuant from the dividing line.\r\n\r\n\"408. TANNENVELS: Azure, a lion rampant or, queué argent.\r\n\r\n\"489. RINACH: Or, a lion rampant gules, headed azure.\r\n\r\n\"A curious use of the lion as a charge occurs in several ancient coats of\r\nthe Low Countries, _e.g._ in that of TRASEGNIES, whose arms are: Bandé d'or\r\net d'azur, à l'ombre du lion brochant sur le tout, à la bordure engrêlée\r\nd'or. Here the ombre du lion is properly represented by a darker shade of\r\nthe tincture (either of or or of azure), but often the artist contents\r\nhimself with simply drawing the outline of the animal in a neutral tint.\r\n\r\n\"Among other curiosities of the use of the lion are the following foreign\r\ncoats:--\r\n\r\n\"BOISSIAU, in France, bears: De gueules, semé de lions d'argent.\r\n\r\n\"MINUTOLI, of Naples: Gules, a lion rampant vair, the head and feet or.\r\n\r\n\"LOEN, of Holland: Azure, a decapitated lion rampant argent, three jets of\r\nblood spurting from the neck proper.\r\n\r\n\"PAPACODA, of Naples: Sable, a lion rampant or, its tail turned over its\r\nhead and held by its teeth.\r\n\r\n\"The Counts REINACH, of Franconia: Or, a lion rampant gules, hooded and\r\nmasked azure (see above).\"\r\n\r\nTo these instances the arms of Westbury may well be added, these being:\r\nQuarterly, or and azure, a cross patonce, on a bordure twenty lions rampant\r\nall counter-changed. No doubt the origin of such a curious bordure is to be\r\nfound in the \"bordure of England,\" which, either as a mark of cadency or as\r\nan indication of affinity or augmentation, can be found in some number of\r\ninstances. Probably one will suffice as an example. This is forthcoming in\r\nFig. 61, which shows the arms of John de Bretagne, Earl of Richmond. Of a\r\nsimilar nature is the bordure of Spain (indicative of his maternal descent)\r\nborne by Richard of Conisburgh, Earl of Cambridge, who bore: Quarterly\r\nFrance and England, a label of three points argent, each charged with {189}\r\nas many torteaux, on a bordure of the same twelve lions rampant purpure\r\n(Fig. 316).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 317.--Arms of Bohemia, from the \"Pulver Turme\" at\r\nPrague. (Latter half of the fifteenth century.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 316.--Arms of Richard of Conisburgh, Earl of Cambridge.\r\n(From MS. Cott., Julius C. vii.)]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the lion, the hint may perhaps be usefully conveyed that the\r\ntemptation to over-elaborate the lion when depicting it heraldically should\r\nbe carefully avoided. The only result is confusion--the very contrary of\r\nthe essence of heraldic emblazonment, which was, is, and should be, the\r\nmethod of clear advertisement of identity. Examples of over-elaboration\r\ncan, however, be found in the past, as will be seen from Fig. 317. This\r\nexample belongs to the latter half of the fifteenth century, and represents\r\nthe arms of Bohemia. It is taken from a shield on the \"Pulver Turme\" at\r\nPrague.\r\n\r\nParts of lions are very frequently to be met with, particularly as crests.\r\nIn fact the most common crest in existence is the _demi-lion rampant_ (Fig.\r\n318). This is the upper half of a lion rampant. It is comparatively seldom\r\nfound other than rampant and couped, so that the term \"a demi-lion,\" unless\r\notherwise qualified, may always be assumed to be a demi-lion rampant\r\ncouped. As charges upon the shield three will be found in the arms of\r\nBennet, Earl of Tankerville: \"Gules, a bezant between three demi-lions\r\nrampant argent.\"\r\n\r\nThe demi-lion may be both guardant and regardant.\r\n\r\n_Demi-lions rampant and erased_ are more common as charges than as crests.\r\nThey are to be found in several Harrison coats of arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 318.--A demi-lion rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 319.--A demi-lion passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 320.--A lion's head couped.]\r\n\r\n_Demi-lions passant_ (Fig. 319) are rather unusual, but in addition to the\r\nseeming cases in which they occur by dimidiation they are sometimes found,\r\nas in the case of the arms of Newman. {190}\r\n\r\n_Demi-lion affronté._--The only case which has come under notice would\r\nappear to be the crest of Campbell of Aberuchill.\r\n\r\n_Demi-lion issuant._--This term is applied to a demi-lion when it issues\r\nfrom an ordinary, _e.g._ from the base line of the chief, as in the arms of\r\nDormer, Markham, and Abney; or from behind a fesse, as in the arms of\r\nChalmers.\r\n\r\n_Demi-lion naissant_ issues from the centre of an ordinary, and not from\r\nbehind it.\r\n\r\n_Lions' heads_, both couped (Fig. 320) and erased, are very frequently met\r\nwith both as charges on the shield and as crests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 321.--A lion's face.]\r\n\r\n_Lion's gamb._--Many writers make a distinction between the _gamb_ (which\r\nis stated to be the lower part only, couped or erased half-way up the leg)\r\nand the _paw_, but this distinction cannot be said to be always rigidly\r\nobserved. In fact some authorities quote the exact reverse as the\r\ndefinition of the terms. As charges the gamb or paw will be found to occur\r\nin the arms of Lord Lilford [\"Or, a lion's gamb erased in bend dexter\r\nbetween two crosslets fitchée in bend sinister gules\"], and in the arms of\r\nNewdigate. This last is a curious example, inasmuch as, without being so\r\nspecified in the blazon, the gambs are represented in the position occupied\r\nby the sinister foreleg of a lion passant.\r\n\r\nThe crest upon the Garter Plate of Edward Cherleton, Lord Cherleton of\r\nPowis, must surely be unique. It consists of two lions' paws embowed, the\r\nouter edge of each being adorned with fleurs-de-lis issuant therefrom.\r\n\r\n_A lion's tail_ will sometimes be found as a crest, and it also occurs as a\r\ncharge in the arms of Corke, viz.: \"Sable, three lions' tails erect and\r\nerased argent.\"\r\n\r\n_A lion's face_ (Fig. 321) should be carefully distinguished from a lion's\r\nhead. In the latter case the neck, either couped or erased, must be shown;\r\nbut a lion's face is affronté and cut off closely behind the ears. The\r\ndistinction between the head and the face can be more appropriately\r\nconsidered in the case of the leopard. {191}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nBEASTS\r\n\r\nNext after the lion should be considered the tiger, but it must be\r\ndistinctly borne in mind that heraldry knows two kinds of tigers--the\r\nheraldic tiger (Figs. 322 and 323) and the Bengal tiger (Figs. 324 and\r\n325). Doubtless the heraldic tiger, which was the only one found in British\r\narmory until a comparatively recent date, is the attempt of artists to\r\ndepict their idea of a tiger. The animal was unknown to them, except by\r\nrepute, and consequently the creature they depicted bears little relation\r\nto the animal of real life; but there can be no doubt that their intention\r\nwas to depict an animal which they knew to exist. The heraldic tiger had a\r\nbody much like the natural tiger, it had a lion's tufted tail and mane, and\r\nthe curious head which it is so difficult to describe, but which appears to\r\nbe more like the wolf than any other animal we know. This, however, will be\r\nagain dealt with in the chapter on fictitious animals, and is here only\r\nintroduced to demonstrate the difference which heraldry makes between the\r\nheraldic tiger and the real animal. A curious conceit is that the heraldic\r\ntiger will anciently be often found spelt \"tyger,\" but this peculiar\r\nspelling does not seem ever to have been applied to the tiger of nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 322.--Heraldic tyger rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 323.--Heraldic tyger passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 324.--Bengal tiger passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 325.--Bengal tiger rampant.]\r\n\r\n{192}\r\n\r\nWhen it became desirable to introduce the real tiger into British armory as\r\ntypical of India and our Eastern Empire, something of course was necessary\r\nto distinguish it from the tyger which had previously usurped the name in\r\narmory, and for this reason the natural tiger is always heraldically known\r\nas the Bengal tiger. This armorial variety appears towards the end of the\r\neighteenth century in this country, though in foreign heraldry it appears\r\nto have been recognised somewhat earlier. There are, however, but few cases\r\nin which the Bengal tiger has appeared in armory, and in the majority of\r\nthese cases as a supporter, as in the supporters of Outram, which are two\r\ntigers rampant guardant gorged with wreaths of laurel and crowned with\r\nEastern crowns all proper. Another instance of the tiger as a supporter\r\nwill be found in the arms of Bombay. An instance in which it appears as a\r\ncharge upon a shield will be found in the arms granted to the University of\r\nMadras.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 326.--Leopard passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 327.--Leopard passant guardant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 328.--Leopard rampant.]\r\n\r\nAnother coat is that granted in 1874 to Augustus Beaty Bradbury of\r\nEdinburgh, which was: \"Argent, on a mount in base vert, a Bengal tiger\r\npassant proper, on a chief of the second two other tigers dormant also\r\nproper.\" A _tigress_ is said to be occasionally met with, and when so, is\r\nsometimes represented with a mirror, in relation to the legend that\r\nascribes to her such personal vanity that her young ones might be taken\r\nfrom under her charge if she had the counter attraction of a hand-glass! At\r\nleast so say the heraldry books, but I have not yet come across such a\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe leopard (Figs. 326, 327, and 328) has to a certain extent been referred\r\nto already. Doubtless it is the peculiar cat-like and stealthy walk which\r\nis so characteristic of the leopard which led to any animal in that\r\nposition being considered a leopard; but the leopard in its natural state\r\nwas of course known to Europeans in the early days of heraldry, and appears\r\namongst the lists of heraldic animals apart from its existence as \"a lion\r\npassant.\" The animal, {193} however, except as a supporter or crest, is by\r\nno means common in English heraldry. It will be found, however, in the\r\ncrests of some number of families; for example, Taylor and Potts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 329.--Leopard's head erased.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 330.--Leopard's head erased and affronté.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 331.--Leopard's face.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 332.--Leopard's face jessant-de-lis.]\r\n\r\nA very similar animal is the ounce, which for heraldic purposes is in no\r\nway altered from the leopard. Parts of the latter will be found in use as\r\nin the case of the lion. As a crest the demi-leopard, the leopard's head\r\n(Fig. 329), and the leopard's head affronté (Fig. 330) are often to be met\r\nwith. In both cases it should be noticed that _the neck is visible_, and\r\nthis should be borne in mind, because this constitutes the difference\r\nbetween the leopard's head and the leopard's face (Fig. 331). The leopard's\r\nface is by far the most usual form in which the leopard will be found in\r\narmory, and can be traced back to quite an early period in heraldry. The\r\nleopard's face shows no neck at all, the head being removed close behind\r\nthe ears. It is then represented affronté. For some unfathomable reason\r\nthese charges when they occur in the arms of Shrewsbury are usually\r\nreferred to locally as \"loggerheads.\" They were perpetuated in the arms of\r\nthe county in its recent grant. A curious development or use of the\r\nleopard's face occurs when it is jessant-de-lis (Fig. 332). This will be\r\nfound referred to at greater length under the heading of the Fleur-de-lis.\r\n\r\n{194}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 333.--Arms of Styria. (Drawn by Hans Burgkmair, 1523.)]\r\n\r\nThe _panther_ is an animal which in its relation to heraldry it is\r\ndifficult to know whether to place amongst the mythical or actual animals.\r\nNo instance occurs to me in which the panther figures as a charge in\r\nBritish heraldry, and the panther as a supporter, in the few cases in which\r\nit is met with, is certainly not the actual animal, inasmuch as it is\r\ninvariably found flammant, _i.e._ with flames issuing from the mouth and\r\nears. In this character it will be found as a supporter of the Duke of\r\nBeaufort, and derived therefrom as a supporter of Lord Raglan. Foreign\r\nheraldry carries the panther to a most curious result. It is frequently\r\nrepresented with the tail of a lion, horns, and for its fore-legs the claws\r\nof an eagle. Even in England it is usually represented vomiting flames, but\r\nthe usual method of depicting it on the Continent is greatly at variance\r\nwith our own. Fig. 333 represents the same arms of Styria--Vert, a panther\r\nargent, armed close, vomiting flames of fire--from the title-page of the\r\n_Land-bond_ of Styria in the year 1523, drawn by Hans Burgkmair. In\r\n_Physiologus_, a Greek writing {195} of early Christian times of about the\r\ndate 140, which in the course of time has been translated into every\r\ntongue, mention is made of the panther, to which is there ascribed the\r\ngaily spotted coat and the pleasant, sweet-smelling breath which induces\r\nall other animals to approach it; the dragon alone retreats into its hole\r\nfrom the smell, and consequently the panther appears to have sometimes been\r\nused as a symbol of Christ. The earliest armorial representations of this\r\nanimal show the form not greatly dissimilar to nature; but very soon the\r\nsimilarity disappears in Continental representations, and the fancy of the\r\nartist transferred the animal into the fabulous creature which is now\r\nrepresented. The sweet-smelling breath, _suozzon-stanch_ as it is called in\r\nthe early German translation of the _Physiologus_, was expressed by the\r\nflames issuing from the mouth, but later in the sixteenth century flames\r\nissued from every opening in the head. The head was in old times similar to\r\nthat of a horse, occasionally horned (as in the seal of Count Heinrich von\r\nLechsgemünd, 1197); the fore-feet were well developed. In the second half\r\nof the fourteenth century the fore-feet assume the character of eagles'\r\nclaws, and the horns of the animal were a settled matter. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Lake Constance we find the panther with divided hoofs on\r\nhis hind-feet; perhaps with a reference to the panther's \"cleanness.\"\r\nAccording to the Mosaic law, of course, a four-footed animal, to be\r\nconsidered clean, must not have paws, and a ruminant must not have an\r\nundivided hoof. Italian heraldry is likewise acquainted with the panther,\r\nbut under another name (_La Dolce_, the sweet one) and another form. The\r\ndolce has a head like a hare, and is unhorned. (See A. Anthony v.\r\nSiegenfeld, \"The Territorial Arms of Styria,\" Graz, 1898.)\r\n\r\nThe panther is given by Segar, Garter King of Arms 1603-1663, as one of the\r\nbadges of King Henry VI., where it is silver, spotted of various colours,\r\nand with flames issuing from its mouth and ears. No doubt this Royal badge\r\nis the origin of the supporter of the Duke of Beaufort.\r\n\r\nEnglish armory knows an animal which it terms the male griffin, which has\r\nno wings, but which has gold rays issuing from its body in all directions.\r\nStröhl terms the badge of the Earls of Ormonde, which from his description\r\nare plainly male griffins, _keythongs_, which he classes with the panther;\r\nand probably he is correct in looking upon our male griffin as merely one\r\nform of the heraldic panther.\r\n\r\nThe _cat_, under the name of the cat, the wild cat, the cat-a-mountain, or\r\nthe cat-a-mount (Figs. 334, 335, and 336), is by no means infrequent in\r\nBritish armory, though it will usually be found in Scottish or Irish\r\nexamples. The arms of Keates and Scott-Gatty in which it figures are\r\nEnglish examples, however. {196}\r\n\r\nThe wolf (Figs. 337-341) is a very frequent charge in English armory. Apart\r\nfrom its use as a supporter, in which position it is found in conjunction\r\nwith the shields of Lord Welby, Lord Rendell, and Viscount Wolseley, it\r\nwill be found in the arms of Lovett and in by far the larger proportion of\r\nthe coats for the name of Wilson and in the arms of Low.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 334.--Cat-a-mountain sejant guardant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 335.--Cat-a-mountain sejant guardant erect.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 336.--Cat-a-mountain passant guardant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 337.--Wolf rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 338.--Wolf salient.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 339.--Wolf courant.]\r\n\r\nThe wolf, however, in earlier representations has a less distinctly\r\nwolf-like character, it being sometimes difficult to distinguish the wolf\r\nfrom some other heraldic animals. This is one of these cases in which,\r\nowing to insufficient knowledge and crude draughtsmanship, ancient heraldry\r\nis not to be preferred to more realistic treatment. The demi-wolf is a very\r\nfrequent crest, occurring not only in the arms and crests of members of the\r\nWilson and many other families, but also as the crest of Wolfe. The latter\r\ncrest is worthy of remark, inasmuch as the Royal crown which is held within\r\nits paws typifies the assistance given to King Charles II., after the\r\nbattle of Worcester, by Mr. Francis Wolfe of Madeley, to whom the crest was\r\ngranted. King Charles, it may be noted, also gave to Mr. Wolfe a silver\r\ntankard, upon the lid of which was a representation of this crest. Wolves'\r\nheads are particularly common, especially in Scottish heraldry. An example\r\nof them will be found in the arms of {197} \"Struan\" Robertson, and in the\r\ncoats used by all other members of the Robertson Clan having or claiming\r\ndescent from, or relationship with, the house of Struan. The wolf's head\r\nalso appears in the arms of Skeen. Woodward states that the wolf is the\r\nmost common of all heraldic animals in Spanish heraldry, where it is\r\nfrequently represented as _ravissant, i.e._ carrying the body of a lamb in\r\nits mouth or across its back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 340.--Wolf passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 341.--Wolf statant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 342.--A lynx coward.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 343.--Fox passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 344.--Fox sejant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 345.--A fox's mask.]\r\n\r\nMuch akin to the wolf is the _Lynx_; in fact the heraldic representation of\r\nthe two animals is not greatly different. The lynx does not often occur in\r\nheraldry except as a supporter, but it will be found as the crest of the\r\nfamily of Lynch. The lynx is nearly always depicted and blazoned \"coward,\"\r\n_i.e._ with its tail between its legs (Fig. 342). Another instance of this\r\nparticular animal is found in the crest of Comber.\r\n\r\nA _Fox_ (Figs. 343 and 344) which from the similarity of its representation\r\nis often confused with a wolf, is said by Woodward to be very seldom met\r\nwith in British heraldry. This is hardly a correct statement, inasmuch as\r\ncountless instances can be produced in which a fox figures as a charge, a\r\ncrest, or a supporter. The fox is found on the arms and as the crest, and\r\ntwo are the supporters of Lord Ilchester, and instances of its appearance\r\nwill be found amongst others in the arms {198} or crests, for example, of\r\nFox, Colfox, and Ashworth. Probably the most curious example of the\r\nheraldic fox will be found in the arms of Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, who for\r\nthe arms of Williams quarters: \"Argent, two foxes counter-salient gules,\r\nthe dexter surmounted of the sinister.\" The face of a fox is termed its\r\nmask (Fig. 345).\r\n\r\n_The Bear_ (Figs. 346-349) is frequently found figuring largely in coats of\r\narms for the names of Barnard, Baring, Barnes, and Bearsley, and for other\r\nnames which can be considered to bear canting relation to the charge. In\r\nfact the arms, crest, and motto of Barnard together form such an excellent\r\nexample of the little jokes which characterise heraldry that I quote the\r\nblazon in full. The coat is \"argent, a bear rampant sable,\" the crest is \"a\r\ndemi-bear sable,\" and the motto \"Bear and forbear.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 346.--Bear rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 347.--Bear passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 348.--Bear statant.]\r\n\r\nThe bear is generally muzzled, but this must not be presumed unless\r\nmentioned in the blazon. Bears' paws are often found both in crests and as\r\ncharges upon shields, but as they differ little if anything in appearance\r\nfrom the lion's gamb, they need not be further particularised. To the\r\nbear's head, however, considerable attention should be paid, inasmuch as\r\nthe manner of depicting it in England and Scotland differs. The bear's\r\nhead, according to English ideas of heraldry, would be depicted down to the\r\nshoulders, and would show the neck couped or erased (Fig. 350). In Scottish\r\nheraldry, bears' heads are almost invariably found couped or erased close\r\nbehind the ears without any of the neck being visible (Figs. 351 and 352);\r\nthey are not, however, represented as caboshed or affronté.\r\n\r\n{199}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 349.--Bear sejant erect.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 350.--Bear's head couped (English).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 351.--Bear's head couped (Scottish).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 352.--Bear's head erased and muzzled (Scottish).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 353.--Boar rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 354.--Boar passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 355.--Boar statant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 356.--Boar's head erased (English).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 357.--Boar's head couped (Scottish).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 358.--Boar's head erased (Scottish).]\r\n\r\n_The Boar_ is an animal which, with its parts, will constantly be met with\r\nin British armory (Figs. 353-355). Theoretically there is a difference\r\nbetween the boar, which is the male of the domestic animal, and the wild\r\nboar, which is the untamed creature of the woods. Whilst the latter is\r\nusually blazoned as a wild boar or sanglier, the latter is just a boar; but\r\nfor all practical purposes no difference whatever is made in heraldic\r\nrepresentations of these varieties, though it may be noted that the crest\r\nof Swinton is often described as a sanglier, as invariably is also the\r\ncrest of Douglas, Earl of Morton [\"A sanglier sticking between the cleft of\r\nan oak-tree fructed, with a lock holding the clefts together all proper\"].\r\nThe boar, like the lion, is usually described as armed and langued, but\r\nthis is not necessary when the tusks are represented in their own colour\r\nand when the tongue is gules. It will, however, be very frequently found\r\nthat the tusks are or. The \"armed,\" however, does not include the hoofs,\r\nand if these are to {200} be of any colour different from that of the\r\nanimal, it must be blazoned \"unguled\" of such and such a tincture.\r\nPrecisely the same distinction occurs in the heads of boars (Figs. 356-358)\r\nthat was referred to in bears. The real difference is this, that whilst the\r\nEnglish boar's head has the neck attached to the head and is couped or\r\nerased at the shoulders, the Scottish boar's head is separated close behind\r\nthe ears. No one ever troubled to draw any distinction between the two for\r\nthe purposes of blazon, because the English boars' heads were more usually\r\ndrawn with the neck, and the boars' heads in Scotland were drawn couped or\r\nerased close. But the boars head in Welsh heraldry followed the Scottish\r\nand not the English type. Matters armorial, however, are now cosmopolitan,\r\nand one can no longer ascertain that the crest of Campbell must be\r\nScottish, or that the crest of any other family must be English; and\r\nconsequently, though the terms will not be found employed officially, it is\r\njust as well to distinguish them, because armory can provide means of such\r\ndistinction--the true description of an English boar's head being couped or\r\nerased \"at the neck,\" the Scottish term being a boar's head couped or\r\nerased \"close.\"\r\n\r\nOccasionally a boar's head will be stated to be borne erect; this is then\r\nshown with the mouth pointing upwards. A curious example of this is found\r\nin the crest of Tyrrell: \"A boar's head erect argent, in the mouth a\r\npeacock's tail proper.\"\r\n\r\nWoodward mentions three very strange coats of arms in which the charge,\r\nwhilst not being a boar, bears very close connection with it. He states\r\nthat among the curiosities of heraldry we may place the canting arms of\r\nHam, of Holland: \"Gules, five hams proper, 2, 1, 2.\" The Verhammes also\r\nbear: \"Or, three hams sable.\" These commonplace charges assume almost a\r\npoetical savour when placed beside the matter-of-fact coat of the family of\r\nBacquere: \"d'Azur, à un ecusson d'or en abîme, accompagné de trois groins\r\nde porc d'argent,\" and that of the Wursters of Switzerland: \"Or, two\r\nsausages gules on a gridiron sable, the handle in chief.\"\r\n\r\nHORSES\r\n\r\nIt is not a matter of surprise that the horse is frequently met with in\r\narmory. It will be found, as in the arms of Jedburgh, carrying a mounted\r\nwarrior (Fig. 359), and the same combination appears as the crest of the\r\nDuke of Fife. {201}\r\n\r\nThe horse will be found rampant (or forcene, or salient) (Fig. 360), and\r\nwill be found courant (Fig. 361), passant (Fig. 362), and trotting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 359.--A chevalier on horseback.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 360.--Horse rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 361.--Horse courant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 362.--Horse passant.]\r\n\r\nWhen it is \"comparisoned\" or \"furnished\" it is shown with saddle and bridle\r\nand all appurtenances; but if the saddle is not present it would only be\r\nblazoned \"bridled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gules, a horse argent,\" really the arms of Westphalia, is popularly known\r\nin this country as the coat of Hanover, inasmuch as it was the most\r\nprominent charge upon the inescutcheon or quartering of Hanover formerly\r\nborne with the Royal Arms. Every one in this country is familiar with the\r\nexpression, \"the white horse of Hanover.\"\r\n\r\nHorses will also be found in many cases as supporters, and these will be\r\nreferred to in the chapter upon that subject, but reference should be\r\nparticularly made here to the crest of the family of Lane, of King's\r\nBromley, which is a strawberry roan horse, couped at the flanks, bridled,\r\nsaddled, and holding in its feet the Imperial crown proper. This\r\ncommemorates the heroic action of Mistress Jane Lane, afterwards Lady\r\nFisher, and the sister of Sir Thomas Lane, of King's Bromley, who, after\r\nthe battle of Worcester and when King Charles was in hiding, rode from\r\nStaffordshire to the south coast upon a strawberry roan horse, with King\r\nCharles as her serving-man. For this the Lane family were first of all\r\ngranted the canton of England as an augmentation to their arms, and shortly\r\nafterwards this crest of the demi-horse (Plate II.).\r\n\r\nThe arms of Trevelyan afford an interesting example of a horse, being:\r\n\"Gules, issuant out of water in base proper, a demi-horse argent, hoofed\r\nand maned or.\"\r\n\r\nThe heads of horses are either so described or (and more usually) termed\r\n\"nags' heads,\" though what the difference may be is beyond {202} the\r\ncomprehension of most people; at any rate heraldry knows of none.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the family of Duncombe is curious, and is as follows: \"Out of\r\na ducal coronet or, a horse's hind-leg sable, the shoe argent.\"\r\n\r\nThough they can hardly be termed animate charges, perhaps one may be\r\njustified in here mentioning the horse-shoe (Fig. 363), which is far from\r\nbeing an uncommon charge. It will be found in various arms for the name of\r\nFerrar, Ferrers, Farrer, and Marshall; and, in the arms of one Scottish\r\nfamily of Smith, three horse-shoes interlaced together form an unusual and\r\nrather a curious charge.\r\n\r\nOther instances in which it occurs will be found in the arms of Burlton,\r\nand in the arms used by the town of Oakham. In the latter case it doubtless\r\nhas reference to the toll of a horse-shoe, which the town collects from\r\nevery peer or member of the Royal Family who passes through its limits. The\r\ncollection of these, which are usually of silver, and are carefully\r\npreserved, is one of the features of the town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 363.--Horse-shoe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 364.--Sea-horse.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 365.--Pegasus rampant.]\r\n\r\nThe sea-horse, the unicorn, and the pegasus may perhaps be more properly\r\nconsidered as mythical animals, and the unicorn will, of course, be treated\r\nunder that heading; but the sea-horse and the pegasus are so closely allied\r\nin form to the natural animal that perhaps it will be simpler to treat of\r\nthem in this chapter. The sea-horse (Fig. 364) is composed of the head and\r\nneck of a horse and the tail of a fish, but in place of the fore-feet,\r\nwebbed paws are usually substituted. Two sea-horses respecting each other\r\nwill be found in the coat of arms of Pirrie, and sea-horses naiant will be\r\nfound in the arms of McCammond. It is a matter largely left to the\r\ndiscretion of the artist, but the sea-horse will be found as often as not\r\ndepicted with a fin at the back of its neck in place of a mane. A sea-horse\r\nas a crest will be found in the case of Belfast and in the crests of\r\nClippingdale and Jenkinson. The sea-horse is sometimes represented winged,\r\nbut I know of no officially sanctioned example. When represented rising\r\nfrom the sea the animal is said to be \"assurgeant.\" {203}\r\n\r\nThe pegasus (Figs. 365 and 366), though often met with as a crest or found\r\nin use as a supporter, is very unusual as a charge upon an escutcheon. It\r\nwill be found, however, in the arms of the Society of the Inner Temple and\r\nin the arms of Richardson, which afford an example of a pegasus rampant and\r\nalso an example in the crest of a pegasus sejant, which at present is the\r\nonly one which exists in British heraldry.\r\n\r\nFig. 367 gives a solitary instance of a mare. The arms, which are from\r\nGrünenberg's _Wappenbuch_ (1483), are attributed to \"Herr von Frouberg from\r\nthe Forest in Bavaria,\" and are: Gules, a mare rampant argent, bridled\r\nsable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 366.--Pegasus passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 367.--Arms of Herr von Frouberg.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 368.--Talbot passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 369.--Talbot statant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 370.--Talbot rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 371.--Talbot sejant.]\r\n\r\nThe _ass_ is not a popular charge, but the family of Mainwaring have an\r\nass's head for a crest.\r\n\r\nDOGS\r\n\r\nDogs will be found of various kinds in many English and Scottish coats of\r\narms, though more frequently in the former than in the latter. The original\r\nEnglish dog, the hound of early days, is, of course, the talbot (Figs. 368,\r\n369, 370, and 371). Under the heading of {204} supporters certain instances\r\nwill be quoted in which dogs of various kinds and breeds figure in\r\nheraldry, but the talbot as a charge will be found in the arms of the old\r\nStaffordshire family, Wolseley of Wolseley, a cadet of which house is the\r\npresent Field-Marshal Viscount Wolseley. The Wolseley arms are: \"Argent, a\r\ntalbot passant gules.\" Other instances of the talbot will be found in the\r\narms or crests of the families of Grosvenor, Talbot, and Gooch. The arms\r\n\"Azure, three talbots statant or,\" were granted by Cooke to Edward Peke of\r\nHeldchurchgate, Kent. A sleuth-hound treading gingerly upon the points of a\r\ncoronet [\"On a ducal coronet, a sleuth-hound proper, collared and leashed\r\ngules\"] was the crest of the Earl of Perth and Melfort, and one wonders\r\nwhether the motto, \"Gang warily,\" may not really have as much relation to\r\nthe perambulations of the crest as to the dangerous foothold amongst the\r\ngaltraps which is provided for the supporters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 372.--Greyhound passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 373.--Greyhound courant.]\r\n\r\nGreyhounds (Figs. 372 and 373) are, of course, very frequently met with,\r\nand amongst the instances which can be mentioned are the arms of Clayhills,\r\nHughes-Hunter of Plas Coch, and Hunter of Hunterston. A curious coat of\r\narms will be found under the name of Udney of that Ilk, registered in the\r\nLyon Office, namely: \"Gules, two greyhounds counter-salient argent,\r\ncollared of the field, in the inner point a stag's head couped and attired\r\nwith ten tynes, all between the three fleurs-de-lis, two in chief and one\r\nin base, or.\" Another very curious coat of arms is registered as the design\r\nof the reverse of the seal of the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow, and is: \"Or, a\r\ngreyhound bitch sable, chained to an oak-tree within a loch proper.\" This\r\ncurious coat of arms, however, being the reverse of the seal, is seldom if\r\never made use of.\r\n\r\nTwo bloodhounds are the supporters to the arms of Campbell of Aberuchill.\r\n\r\nThe dog may be salient, that is, springing, its hind-feet on the ground;\r\npassant, when it is sometimes known as trippant, otherwise walking; and\r\ncourant when it is at full speed. It will be found occasionally couchant or\r\nlying down, but if depicted chasing another animal (as in the arms of\r\nEchlin) it is described as \"in full chase,\" or \"in full course.\"\r\n\r\nA mastiff will be found in the crest of Crawshay, and there is a {205}\r\nwell-known crest of a family named Phillips which is \"a dog sejant\r\nregardant surmounted by a bezant charged with a representation of a dog\r\nsaving a man from drowning.\" Whether this crest has any official authority\r\nor not I do not know, but I should imagine it is highly doubtful.\r\n\r\nFoxhounds appear as the supporters of Lord Hindlip; and when depicted with\r\nits nose to the ground a dog is termed \"a hound on scent.\"\r\n\r\nA winged greyhound is stated to be the crest of a family of Benwell. A\r\ngreyhound \"courant\" will be found in the crests of Daly and Watney; and a\r\ncurious crest is that of Biscoe, which is a greyhound seizing a hare. The\r\ncrest of Anderson, until recently borne by the Earl of Yarborough, is a\r\nwater spaniel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 374.--A sea-dog.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 375.--Bull rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 376.--Bull passant.]\r\n\r\nThe sea-dog (Fig. 374) is a most curious animal. It is represented much as\r\nthe talbot, but with scales, webbed feet, and a broad scaly tail like a\r\nbeaver. In my mind there is very little doubt that the sea-dog is really\r\nthe early heraldic attempt to represent a beaver, and I am confirmed in\r\nthat opinion by the arms of the city of Oxford. There has been considerable\r\nuncertainty as to what the sinister supporter was intended to represent. A\r\nreference to the original record shows that a beaver is the real supporter,\r\nbut the representation of the animal, which in form has varied little, is\r\nvery similar to that of a sea-dog. The only instances I am aware of in\r\nBritish heraldry in which it occurs under the name of a sea-dog are the\r\nsupporters of the Barony of Stourton and the crest of Dodge[17] (Plate\r\nVI.).\r\n\r\nBULLS\r\n\r\nThe bull (Figs. 375 and 376), and also the calf, and very occasionally the\r\ncow and the buffalo, have their allotted place in heraldry. {206} They are\r\namongst the few animals which can never be represented proper, inasmuch as\r\nin its natural state the bull is of very various colours. And yet there is\r\nan exception to even this apparently obvious fact, for the bulls connected\r\nwith or used either as crests, badges, or supporters by the various\r\nbranches of the Nevill family are all pied bulls [\"Arms of the Marquis of\r\nAbergavenny: Gules, on a saltire argent, a rose of the field, barbed and\r\nseeded proper. Crest: a bull statant argent, pied sable, collared and chain\r\nreflexed over the back or. Supporters; two bulls argent, pied sable, armed,\r\nunguled, collared and chained, and at the end of the chain two staples or.\r\nBadges: on the dexter a rose gules, seeded or, barbed vert; on the sinister\r\na portcullis or. Motto: 'Ne vile velis.'\"] The bull in the arms of the town\r\nof Abergavenny, which are obviously based upon the arms and crest of the\r\nMarquess of Abergavenny, is the same.\r\n\r\nExamples of the bull will be found in the arms of Verelst, Blyth, and\r\nFfinden. A bull salient occurs in the arms of De Hasting [\"Per pale vert\r\nand or, a bull salient counterchanged\"]. The arms of the Earl of\r\nShaftesbury show three bulls, which happen to be the quartering for Ashley.\r\nThis coat of arms affords an instance, and a striking one, of the manner in\r\nwhich arms have been improperly assumed in England. The surname of the Earl\r\nof Shaftesbury is Ashley-Cooper. It may be mentioned here in passing,\r\nthrough the subject is properly dealt with elsewhere in the volume, that in\r\nan English sub-quarterly coat for a double name the arms for the last and\r\nmost important name are the first and fourth quarterings. But Lord\r\nShaftesbury himself is the only person who bears the name of Cooper, all\r\nother members of the family except his lordship being known by the name of\r\nAshley only. Possibly this may be the reason which accounts for the fact\r\nthat by a rare exception Lord Shaftesbury bears the arms of Ashley in the\r\nfirst and fourth quarters, and Cooper in the second and third. But by a\r\nvery general mistake these arms of Ashley [\"Argent, three bulls passant\r\nsable, armed and unguled or\"] were until recently almost invariably\r\ndescribed as the arms of Cooper. The result has been that during the last\r\ncentury they were \"jumped\" right and left by people of the name of Cooper,\r\nentirely in ignorance of the fact that the arms of Cooper (if it were, as\r\none can only presume, the popular desire to indicate a false relationship\r\nto his lordship) are: \"Gules, a bend engrailed between six lions rampant\r\nor.\" The ludicrous result has been that to those who know, the arms have\r\nstood self-condemned, and in the course of time, as it has become necessary\r\nfor these Messrs. Cooper to legalise these usurped insignia, the new\r\ngrants, differentiated versions of arms previously in use, have nearly all\r\nbeen founded upon this Ashley coat. At any rate there must be a score or\r\nmore Cooper {207} grants with bulls as the principal charges, and\r\ninnumerable people of the name of Cooper are still using without authority\r\nthe old Ashley coat pure and simple.\r\n\r\nThe bull as a crest is not uncommon, belonging amongst other families to\r\nRidley, Sykes, and De Hoghton; and the demi-bull, and more frequently the\r\nbull's head, are often met with. A bull's leg is the crest of De la Vache,\r\nand as such appears upon two of the early Garter plates. Winged bulls are\r\nthe supporters of the Butchers' Livery Company. A bull's scalp occurs upon\r\na canton over the arms of Cheney, a coat quartered by Johnston and Cure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 377.--Bull's head caboshed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 378.--Armorial bearings of John Henry Metcalfe, Esq.:\r\nArgent, three calves passant sable, a canton gules.]\r\n\r\nThe ox seldom occurs, except that, in order sometimes to preserve a pun, a\r\nbovine animal is sometimes so blazoned, as in the case of the arms of the\r\nCity of Oxford. Cows also are equally rare, but occur in the arms of Cowell\r\n[\"Ermine, a cow statant gules, within a bordure sable, bezantée\"] and in\r\nthe modern grants to the towns of Rawtenstall and Cowbridge. Cows' heads\r\nappear on the arms of Veitch [\"Argent, three cows' heads erased sable\"],\r\nand these were transferred to the cadency bordure of the Haig arms when\r\nthese were rematriculated for Mr. H. Veitch Haig.\r\n\r\nCalves are of much more frequent occurrence than cows, appearing in many\r\ncoats of arms in which they are a pun upon the name. They will be found in\r\nthe arms of Vaile and Metcalfe (Fig. 378). Special attention may well be\r\ndrawn to the last-mentioned illustration, inasmuch as it is by Mr. J. H.\r\nMetcalfe, whose heraldic work has obtained a well-deserved reputation. A\r\nbull or cow is termed \"armed\" if the horns are of a different tincture from\r\nthe head. The term \"unguled\" applies to the hoofs, and \"ringed\" is used\r\nwhen, as is sometimes the case, a ring passes through the nostrils. A\r\nbull's head is sometimes found caboshed (Fig. 377), as in the crest of\r\nMacleod, or as in the arms of Walrond. The position of the tail is one of\r\nthose matters which are left to the artist, and unless the blazon contains\r\nany statement to the contrary, it may be placed in any convenient position.\r\n\r\n{208}\r\n\r\nSTAGS\r\n\r\nThe stag, using the term in its generic sense, under the various names of\r\nstag, deer, buck, roebuck, hart, doe, hind, reindeer, springbok, and other\r\nvarieties, is constantly met with in British armory, as well as in that of\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 379.--Stag lodged.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 380.--Stag trippant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 381.--Stag courant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 382.--Stag springing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 383.--Stag at gaze.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 384.--Stag statant.]\r\n\r\nIn the specialised varieties, such as the springbok and the reindeer,\r\nnaturally an attempt is made to follow the natural animal in its salient\r\npeculiarities, but as to the remainder, heraldry knows little if any\r\ndistinction after the following has been properly observed. The stag, which\r\nis really the male red deer, has horns which are branched with pointed\r\nbranches from the bottom to the top; but a buck, which is the fallow deer,\r\nhas broad and flat palmated horns. Anything in the nature of a stag must be\r\nsubject to the following terms. If lying down it is termed \"lodged\" (Fig.\r\n379), if walking it is termed \"trippant\" (Fig. 380), if running it is\r\ntermed \"courant\" (Fig. 381), or \"at speed\" or \"in full chase.\" It is termed\r\n\"salient\" when springing (Fig. 382), though the term \"springing\" is\r\nsometimes employed, and it is said to be \"at gaze\" when statant with the\r\nhead turned to face the spectator (Fig. 383); but it should be noted that a\r\nstag may also be \"statant\" (Fig. 384); and it is not \"at gaze\" unless the\r\nhead is turned round. {209} When it is necessary owing to a difference of\r\ntincture or for other reasons to refer to the horns, a stag or buck is\r\ndescribed as \"attired\" of such and such a colour, whereas bulls, rams, and\r\ngoats are said to be \"armed.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the stag is said to be attired of ten or any other number of tynes, it\r\nmeans that there are so many points to its horns. Like other cloven-footed\r\nanimals, the stag can be unguled of a different colour.\r\n\r\nThe stag's head is very frequently met with, but it will be almost more\r\nfrequently found as a stag's head caboshed (Fig. 385). In these cases the\r\nhead is represented affronté and removed close behind the ears, so that no\r\npart of the neck is visible. The stag's head caboshed occurs in the arms of\r\nCavendish and Stanley, and also in the arms of Legge, Earl of Dartmouth.\r\nFigs. 386 and 387 are examples of other heads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 385.--Stag's head caboshed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 386.--Stag's head erased.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 387.--Buck's head couped.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 388.--Hind.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 389.--Reindeer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 390.--Winged stag rampant.]\r\n\r\nThe attires of a stag are to be found either singly (as in the arms of\r\nBoyle) or in the form of a pair attached to the scalp. The crest of Jeune\r\naffords an instance of a scalp. The hind or doe (Fig. 388) is sometimes met\r\nwith, as in the crest of Hatton, whilst a hind's head is the crest of\r\nConran.\r\n\r\nThe reindeer (Fig. 389) is less usual, but reindeer heads will be found in\r\nthe arms of Fellows. It, however, appears as a supporter for {210} several\r\nEnglish peers. Winged stags (Fig. 390) were the supporters of De Carteret,\r\nEarls of Granville, and \"a demi-winged stag gules, collared argent,\" is the\r\ncrest of Fox of Coalbrookdale, co. Salop.\r\n\r\nMuch akin to the stag is the antelope, which, unless specified to be an\r\n_heraldic_ antelope, or found in a very old coat, is usually represented in\r\nthe natural form of the animal, and subject to the foregoing rules.\r\n\r\n_Heraldic Antelope._--This animal (Figs. 391, 392, and 393) is found in\r\nEnglish heraldry more frequently as a supporter than as a charge. As an\r\ninstance, however, of the latter form may be mentioned the family of\r\nDighton (Lincolnshire): \"Per pale argent and gules, an heraldic antelope\r\npassant counterchanged.\" It bears little if any relation to the real\r\nanimal, though there can be but small doubt that the earliest forms\r\noriginated in an attempt to represent an antelope or an ibex. Since,\r\nhowever, heraldry has found a use for the real antelope, it has been\r\nnecessary to distinguish it from the creations of the early armorists,\r\nwhich are now known as heraldic antelopes. Examples will be found in the\r\nsupporters of Lord Carew, in the crest of Moresby, and of Bagnall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 391.--Heraldic antelope statant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 392.--The heraldic antelope rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 393.--Heraldic antelope passant.]\r\n\r\nThe difference chiefly consists in the curious head and horns and in the\r\ntail, the heraldic antelope being an heraldic tiger, with the feet and legs\r\nsimilar to those of a deer, and with two straight serrated horns.\r\n\r\n_Ibex._--This is another form of the natural antelope, but with two\r\nsaw-edged horns projecting from the forehead.\r\n\r\nA curious animal, namely, the sea-stag, is often met with in German\r\nheraldry. This is the head, antlers, fore-legs, and the upper part of the\r\nbody of a stag conjoined to the fish-tail end of a mermaid. {211} The only\r\ninstance I am aware of in which it occurs in British armory is the case of\r\nthe arms of Marindin, which were recently matriculated in Lyon Register\r\n(Fig. 394). This coat, however, it should be observed, is really of German\r\nor perhaps of Swiss origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 394.--Armorial bearings of Marindin.]\r\n\r\nTHE RAM AND GOAT\r\n\r\nThe ram (Figs. 395 and 396), the consideration of which must of necessity\r\ninclude the sheep (Fig. 397), the Paschal lamb (Fig. 398), and the fleece\r\n(Fig. 399), plays no unimportant part in armory. The chief heraldic\r\ndifference between the ram and the sheep, to some extent, in opposition to\r\nthe agricultural distinctions, lies in the fact that the ram is always\r\nrepresented with horns and the sheep without. The lamb and the ram are\r\nalways represented with the natural tail, but the sheep is deprived of it.\r\nA ram can of course be \"armed\" (_i.e._ with the horns of a different\r\ncolour) and \"unguled,\" but the latter will seldom be found to be the case.\r\nThe ram, the sheep, and the lamb will nearly always be found either passant\r\nor statant, but a demi-ram is naturally represented in a rampant posture,\r\nthough in such a case the word \"rampant\" is not necessary in the blazon.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, as in the crest of Marwood, the ram will be found couchant.\r\nAs a charge upon a shield the ram will be found in the arms of Sydenham\r\n[\"Argent, three rams passant sable\"], and a ram couchant occurs in the arms\r\nof Pujolas (granted 1762) [\"Per fess wavy azure and argent, in base on a\r\nmount vert, a ram couchant sable, armed and unguled or, in chief three\r\ndoves proper\"]. The arms of Ramsey [\"Azure, a chevron between three {212}\r\nrams passant or\"] and the arms of Harman [\"Sable, a chevron between six\r\nrams counter-passant two and two argent, armed and unguled or\"] are other\r\ninstances in which rams occur. A sheep occurs in the arms of Sheepshanks\r\n[\"Azure, a chevron erminois between in chief three roses and in base a\r\nsheep passant argent. Crest: on a mount vert, a sheep passant argent\"].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 395.--Ram statant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 396.--Ram rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 397.--Sheep passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 398.--Paschal lamb.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 399.--Fleece.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 400.--Ram's head caboshed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 401.--Goat passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 402.--Goat rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 403.--Goat salient.]\r\n\r\nThe lamb, which is by no means an unusual charge in Welsh coats of arms, is\r\nmost usually found in the form of a \"paschal lamb\" (Fig. 398), or some\r\nvariation evidently founded thereupon.\r\n\r\nThe fleece--of course originally of great repute as the badge of {213} the\r\nOrder of the Golden Fleece--has in recent years been frequently employed in\r\nthe grants of arms to towns or individuals connected with the woollen\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe demi-ram and the demi-lamb are to be found as crests, but far more\r\nusual are rams' heads, which figure, for example, in the arms of Ramsden,\r\nand in the arms of the towns of Huddersfield, and Barrow-in-Furness. The\r\nram's head will sometimes be found caboshed, as in the arms of Ritchie and\r\nRoberts.\r\n\r\nPerhaps here reference may fittingly be made to the arms granted by Lyon\r\nOffice in 1812 to Thomas Bonar, co. Kent [\"Argent, a saltire and chief\r\nazure, the last charged with a dexter hand proper, vested with a\r\nshirt-sleeve argent, issuing from the dexter chief point, holding a\r\nshoulder of mutton proper to a lion passant or, all within a bordure\r\ngules\"].\r\n\r\n_The Goat_ (Figs. 401-403) is very frequently met with in armory. Its\r\npositions are passant, statant, rampant, and salient. When the horns are of\r\na different colour it is said to be \"armed.\"\r\n\r\nOTHER ANIMALS\r\n\r\n_The Elephant_ is by no means unusual in heraldry, appearing as a crest, as\r\na charge, and also as a supporter. Nor, strange to say, is its appearance\r\nexclusively modern. The elephant's head, however, is much more frequently\r\nmet with than the entire animal. Heraldry generally finds some way of\r\nstereotyping one of its creations as peculiarly its own, and in regard to\r\nthe elephant, the curious \"elephant and castle\" (Fig. 404) is an example,\r\nthis latter object being, of course, simply a derivative of the howdah of\r\nIndian life. Few early examples of the elephant omit the castle. The\r\nelephant and castle is seen in the arms of Dumbarton and in the crest of\r\nCorbet.\r\n\r\nA curious practice, the result of pure ignorance, has manifested itself in\r\nBritish armory. As will be explained in the chapter upon crests, a large\r\nproportion of German crests are derivatives of the stock basis of two\r\nbull's horns, which formed a recognised ornament for a helmet in Viking and\r\nother pre-heraldic days. As heraldry found its footing it did not in\r\nGermany displace those horns, which in many cases continued alone as the\r\ncrest or remained as a part of it in the form of additions to other\r\nobjects. The craze for decoration at an early period seized upon the horns,\r\nwhich carried repetitions of the arms or their tinctures. As time went on\r\nthe {214} decoration was carried further, and the horns were made with\r\nbell-shaped open ends to receive other objects, usually bunches of feathers\r\nor flowers. So universal did this custom become that even when nothing was\r\ninserted the horns came to be always depicted with these open mouths at\r\ntheir points. But German heraldry now, as has always been the case, simply\r\nterms the figures \"horns.\" In course of time German immigrants made\r\napplication for grants of arms in this country, which, doubtless, were\r\nbased upon other German arms previously in use, but which, evidence of\r\nright not being forthcoming, could not be recorded as borne of right, and\r\nneeded to be granted with alteration as a new coat. The curious result has\r\nbeen that these horns have been incorporated in some number of English\r\ngrants, but they have universally been described as elephants' proboscides,\r\nand are now always so represented in this country. A case in point is the\r\ncrest of Verelst, and another is the crest of Allhusen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 404.--Elephant and castle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 405.--Hare salient.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 406.--Coney.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 407.--Squirrel.]\r\n\r\nElephants' tusks have also been introduced into grants, as in the arms of\r\nLiebreich (borne in pretence by Cock) and Randles [\"Or, a chevron wavy\r\nazure between three pairs of elephants' tusks in saltire proper\"].\r\n\r\n_The Hare_ (Fig. 405) is but rarely met with in British armory. It appears\r\nin the arms of Cleland, and also in the crest of Shakerley, Bart. [\"A hare\r\nproper resting her forefeet on a grab or\"]. A very curious coat [\"Argent,\r\nthree hares playing bagpipes gules\"] belongs to an ancient Derbyshire\r\nfamily FitzErcald, now represented (through the Sacheverell family) by Coke\r\nof Trussley, who quarter the FitzErcald shield.\r\n\r\n_The Rabbit_ (Fig. 406), or, as it is more frequently termed heraldically,\r\nthe Coney, appears more frequently in heraldry than the hare, being the\r\ncanting charge on the arms of Coningsby, Cunliffe [\"Sable, three conies\r\ncourant argent\"], and figuring also as the supporters of Montgomery\r\nCunningham [\"Two conies proper\"].\r\n\r\n_The Squirrel_ (Fig. 407) occurs in many English coats of arms. It is\r\nalways sejant, and very frequently cracking a nut. {215}\r\n\r\n_The Ape_ is not often met with, except in the cases of the different\r\nfamilies of the great Fitz Gerald clan. It is usually the crest, though the\r\nDuke of Leinster also has apes as supporters. One family of Fitzgerald,\r\nhowever, bear it as a charge upon the shield [\"Gules, a saltire invected\r\nper pale argent and or, between four monkeys statant of the second,\r\nenvironed with a plain collar and chained of the second. Mantling gules and\r\nargent. Crest: on a wreath of the colours, a monkey as in the arms, charged\r\non the body with two roses, and resting the dexter fore-leg on a saltire\r\ngules. Motto: 'Crom-a-boo'\"], and the family of Yorke bear an ape's head\r\nfor a crest.\r\n\r\nThe ape is usually met with \"collared and chained\" (Fig. 408), though,\r\nunlike any other animal, the collar of an ape environs its loins and not\r\nits neck. A winged ape is included in Elvin's \"Dictionary of Heraldry\" as a\r\nheraldic animal, but I am not aware to whom it is assigned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 408.--Ape collared and chained.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 409.--Brock.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 410.--Otter.]\r\n\r\n_The Brock_ or _Badger_ (Fig. 409) figures in some number of English arms.\r\nIt is most frequently met with as the crest of Brooke, but will be also\r\nfound in the arms or crests of Brocklebank and Motion.\r\n\r\n_The Otter_ (Fig. 410) is not often met with except in Scottish coats, but\r\nan English example is that of Sir George Newnes, and a demi-otter issuant\r\nfrom a fess wavy will be found quartered by Seton of Mounie.\r\n\r\nAn otter's head, sometimes called a seal's head, for it is impossible to\r\ndistinguish the heraldic representations of the one or the other, appears\r\nin many coats of arms of different families of the name of Balfour, and two\r\notters are the supporters belonging to the head of the Scottish house of\r\nBalfour.\r\n\r\n_The Ermine_, _the Stoat_, and _the Weasel_, &c., are not very often met\r\nwith, but the ermine appears as the crest of Crawford and the marten as the\r\ncrest of a family of that name. {216}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 411.--Urcheon.]\r\n\r\n_The Hedgehog_, or, as it is usually heraldically termed, the _Urcheon_\r\n(Fig. 411), occurs in some number of coats. For example, in the arms of\r\nMaxwell [\"Argent, an eagle with two heads displayed sable, beaked and\r\nmembered gules, on the breast an escutcheon of the first, charged with a\r\nsaltire of the second, surcharged in the centre with a hurcheon (hedgehog)\r\nor, all within a bordure gules\"], Harris, and as the crest of Money-Kyrle.\r\n\r\n_The Beaver_ has been introduced into many coats of late years for those\r\nconnected in any way with Canada. It figures in the arms of Lord Strathcona\r\nand Mount Royal, and in the arms of Christopher.\r\n\r\nThe beaver is one of the supporters of the city of Oxford, and is the sole\r\ncharge in the arms of the town of Biberach (Fig. 412). Originally the arms\r\nwere: \"Argent, a beaver azure, crowned and armed gules,\" but the arms\r\nauthorised by the Emperor Frederick IV., 18th July 1848, were: \"Azure, a\r\nbeaver or.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 412.--Arms of the town of Biberach. (From Ulrich\r\nReichenthal's _Concilium von Constanz_, Augsburg, 1483.)]\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible, or at any rate very unnecessary, to turn a work on\r\narmory into an Illustrated Guide to Natural History, which would be the\r\nresult if under the description of heraldic charges the attempt were made\r\nto deal with all the various animals which have by now been brought to the\r\narmorial fold, owing to the inclusion of each for special and sufficient\r\nreasons in one or two isolated grants.\r\n\r\nFar be it from me, however, to make any remark which should seem to\r\nindicate the raising of any objection to such use. In my opinion it is\r\nhighly admirable, providing there is some definite reason in each case for\r\nthe introduction of these strange animals other than mere caprice. They add\r\nto the interest of heraldry, and they give to modern arms and armory a\r\ndefinite status and meaning, which is a relief from the endless monotony of\r\nmeaningless lions, bends, chevrons, mullets, and martlets.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time the isolated use in a modern grant of such an animal\r\nas the kangaroo does not make it one of the peculiarly heraldic menagerie,\r\nand consequently such instances must be dismissed herein with brief\r\nmention, particularly as many of these creatures heraldically exist only as\r\nsupporters, in which chapter some are more fully {217} discussed. Save as a\r\nsupporter, the only instances I know of the _Kangaroo_ are in the coat of\r\nMoore and in the arms of Arthur, Bart.\r\n\r\n_The Zebra_ will be found as the crest of Kemsley.\r\n\r\n_The Camel_, which will be dealt with later as a supporter, in which form\r\nit appears in the arms of Viscount Kitchener, the town of Inverness (Fig.\r\n251), and some of the Livery Companies, also figures in the reputed but\r\nunrecorded arms of Camelford, and in the arms of Cammell of Sheffield and\r\nvarious other families of a similar name.\r\n\r\nThe fretful _Porcupine_ was borne [\"Gules, a porcupine erect argent,\r\ntusked, collared, and chained or\"] by Simon Eyre, Lord Mayor of London in\r\n1445: and the creature also figures as one of the supporters and the crest\r\nof Sidney, Lord De Lisle and Dudley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 413.--Bat.]\r\n\r\n_The Bat_ (Fig. 413) will be found in the arms of Heyworth and as the crest\r\nof a Dublin family named Wakefield.\r\n\r\n_The Tortoise_ occurs in the arms of a Norfolk family named Gandy, and is\r\nalso stated by Papworth to occur in the arms of a Scottish family named\r\nGoldie. This coat, however, is not matriculated. It also occurs in the\r\ncrests of Deane and Hayne.\r\n\r\n_The Springbok_, which is one of the supporters of Cape Colony, and two of\r\nwhich are the supporters of Viscount Milner, is also the crest of Randles\r\n[\"On a wreath of the colours, a springbok or South African antelope statant\r\nin front of an assegai erect all proper\"].\r\n\r\n_The Rhinoceros_ occurs as one of the supporters of Viscount Colville of\r\nCulross, and also of the crest of Wade, and the _Hippopotamus_ is one of\r\nthe supporters of Speke.\r\n\r\n_The Crocodile_, which is the crest and one of the supporters of Speke, is\r\nalso the crest of Westcar [\"A crocodile proper, collared and chained or\"].\r\n\r\n_The Alpaca_, and also two _Angora Goats'_ heads figure in the arms of\r\nBenn.\r\n\r\n_The Rat_ occurs in the arms of Ratton,[18] which is a peculiarly good\r\nexample of a canting coat.\r\n\r\n_The Mole_, sometimes termed a moldiwarp, occurs in the arms of Mitford\r\n[\"Argent, a fess sable between three moles displayed sable\"]. {218}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMONSTERS\r\n\r\nThe heraldic catalogue of beasts runs riot when we reach those mythical or\r\nlegendary creatures which can only be summarised under the generic term of\r\nmonsters. Most mythical animals, however, can be traced back to some\r\ncomparable counterpart in natural history.\r\n\r\nThe fauna of the New World was of course unknown to those early heraldic\r\nartists in whose knowledge and imagination, no less than in their skill (or\r\nlack of it) in draughtsmanship, lay the nativity of so much of our\r\nheraldry. They certainly thought they were representing animals in\r\nexistence in most if not in all cases, though one gathers that they\r\nconsidered many of the animals they used to be misbegotten hybrids.\r\nDoubtless, working on the assumption of the mule as the hybrid of the horse\r\nand the ass, they jumped to the conclusion that animals which contained\r\nsalient characteristics of two other animals which they knew were likewise\r\nhybrids. A striking example of their theories is to be found in the\r\nheraldic Camelopard, which was anciently devoutly believed to be begotten\r\nby the leopard upon the camel. A leopard they would be familiar with, also\r\nthe camel, for both belong to that corner of the world where the north-east\r\nof the African Continent, the south-east of Europe, and the west of Asia\r\njoin, where were fought out the wars of the Cross, and where heraldry took\r\non itself a definite being. There the known civilisations of the world met,\r\ntaking one from the other knowledge, more or less distorted, ideas and wild\r\nimaginings. A stray giraffe was probably seen by some journeyer up the\r\nNile, who, unable to otherwise account for it, considered and stated the\r\nanimal to be the hybrid offspring of the leopard and camel. Another point\r\nneeds to be borne in mind. Earlier artists were in no way fettered by any\r\nsupposed necessity for making their pictures realistic representations.\r\nRealism is a modernity. Their pictures were decoration, and they thought\r\nfar more of making their subject fit the space to be decorated than of\r\nmaking it a \"speaking likeness.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, their work was not all imagination. In the _Crocodile_ {219}\r\nwe get the basis of the dragon, if indeed the heraldic dragon be not a\r\nperpetuation of ancient legends, or even perhaps of then existing\r\nrepresentations of those winged antediluvian animals, the fossilised\r\nremains of which are now available. Wings, however, need never be\r\nconsidered a difficulty. It has ever been the custom (from the angels of\r\nChristianity to the personalities of Mercury and Pegasus) to add wings to\r\nany figure held in veneration. Why, it would be difficult to say, but\r\nnevertheless the fact remains.\r\n\r\n_The Unicorn_, however, it is not easy to resolve into an original basis,\r\nbecause until the seventeenth century every one fondly believed in the\r\nexistence of the animal. Mr. Beckles Wilson appears to have paid\r\nconsiderable attention to the subject, and was responsible for the article\r\n\"The Rise of the Unicorn\" which recently appeared in _Cassel's Magazine_.\r\nThat writer traces the matter to a certain extent from non-heraldic\r\nsources, and the following remarks, which are taken from the above article,\r\nare of considerable interest:--\r\n\r\n\"The real genesis of the unicorn was probably this: at a time when armorial\r\nbearings were becoming an indispensable part of a noble's equipment, the\r\nattention of those knights who were fighting under the banner of the Cross\r\nwas attracted to the wild antelopes of Syria and Palestine. These animals\r\nare armed with long, straight, spiral horns set close together, so that at\r\na side view they appeared to be but a single horn. To confirm this, there\r\nare some old illuminations and drawings extant which endow the early\r\nunicorn with many of the attributes of the deer and goat kind. The sort of\r\nhorn supposed to be carried by these Eastern antelopes had long been a\r\ncuriosity, and was occasionally brought back as a trophy by travellers from\r\nthe remote parts of the earth. There is a fine one to be seen to-day at the\r\nabbey of St. Denis, and others in various collections in Europe. We now\r\nknow these so-called unicorn's horns, usually carved, to belong to that\r\nmarine monster the narwhal, or sea-unicorn. But the fable of a breed of\r\nhorned horses is at least as old as Pliny\" [Had the \"gnu\" anything to do\r\nwith this?], \"and centuries later the Crusaders, or the monkish artists who\r\naccompanied them, attempted to delineate the marvel. From their first rude\r\nsketches other artists copied; and so each presentment was passed along,\r\nuntil at length the present form of the unicorn was attained. There was a\r\ntime--not so long ago--when the existence of the unicorn was as implicitly\r\nbelieved in as the camel or any other animal not seen in these latitudes;\r\nand the translators of the Bible set their seal upon the legend by\r\ntranslating the Hebrew word _reem_ (which probably meant a rhinoceros) as\r\n'unicorn.' Thus the worthy Thomas Fuller came to consider the existence of\r\nthe unicorn clearly proved by the mention of it in Scripture! Describing\r\n{220} the horn of the animal, he writes, 'Some are plain, as that of St.\r\nMark's in Venice; others wreathed about it, which probably is the effect of\r\nage, those wreaths being but the wrinkles of most vivacious unicorns. The\r\nsame may be said of the colour: white when newly taken from the head;\r\nyellow, like that lately in the Tower, of some hundred years' seniority;\r\nbut whether or no it will soon turn black, as that of Plinie's description,\r\nlet others decide.'\r\n\r\n\"All the books on natural history so late as the seventeenth century\r\ndescribe at length the unicorn; several of them carefully depict him as\r\nthough the artist had drawn straight from the life.\r\n\r\n\"If art had stopped here, the wonder of the unicorn would have remained but\r\na paltry thing after all. His finer qualities would have been unrecorded,\r\nand all his virtues hidden. But, happily, instead of this, about the animal\r\nfirst conceived in the brain of a Greek (as Pegasus also was), and embodied\r\nthrough the fertile fancy of the Crusader, the monks and heraldists of the\r\nMiddle Ages devised a host of spiritual legends. They told of his pride,\r\nhis purity, his endurance, his matchless spirit.\r\n\r\n\"'The greatnesse of his mynde is such that he chooseth rather to dye than\r\nbe taken alive.' Indeed, he was only conquerable by a beautiful maiden. One\r\nfifteenth-century writer gives a recipe for catching a unicorn. 'A maid is\r\nset where he hunteth and she openeth her lap, to whom the unicorn, as\r\nseeking rescue from the force of the hunter, yieldeth his head and leaveth\r\nall his fierceness, and resteth himself under her protection, sleepeth\r\nuntil he is taken and slain.' But although many were reported to be thus\r\nenticed to their destruction, only their horns, strange to say, ever\r\nreached Europe. There is one in King Edward's collection at Buckingham\r\nPalace.\r\n\r\n\"Naturally, the horn of such an animal was held a sovereign specific\r\nagainst poison, and 'ground unicorn's horn' often figures in mediæval books\r\nof medicine.\r\n\r\n\"There was in Shakespeare's time at Windsor Castle the 'horn of a unicorn\r\nof above eight spans and a half in length, valued at above £10,000.' This\r\nmay have been the one now at Buckingham Palace. One writer, describing it,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"'I doe also know that horn the King of England possesseth to be wreathed\r\nin spires, even as that is accounted in the Church of St. Dennis, than\r\nwhich they suppose none greater in the world, and I never saw anything in\r\nany creature more worthy praise than this horne. It is of soe great a\r\nlength that the tallest man can scarcely touch the top thereof, for it doth\r\nfully equal seven great feet. It weigheth thirteen pounds, with their\r\nassize, being only weighed by the gesse of the hands it seemeth much\r\nheavier.' {221}\r\n\r\n\"Spenser, in the 'Faerie Queen,' thus describes a contest between the\r\nunicorn and the lion:--\r\n\r\n 'Like as the lyon, whose imperial powre\r\n  A proud rebellious unicorn defyes,\r\n  T'avoide the rash assault and wrathful stowre\r\n  Of his fiers foe, him to a tree applies.\r\n  And when him running in full course he spyes\r\n  He slips aside; the whiles that furious beast\r\n  His precious horne, sought of his enimyes,\r\n  Strikes in the stroke, ne thence can be released,\r\n  But to the victor yields a bounteous feast.'\r\n\r\n\"'It hath,' remarked Guillim, in 1600, 'been much questioned among\r\nnaturalists which it is that is properly called the unicorn; and some have\r\nmade doubt whether there be such a beast or no. But the great esteem of his\r\nhorn in many places to be seen may take away that needless scruple.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 414.--Unicorn rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 415.--Unicorn passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 416.--Unicorn statant.]\r\n\r\n\"Another old writer, Topsell, says:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 417.--Unicorn rampant.]\r\n\r\n\"'These beasts are very swift, and their legs have not articles. They keep\r\nfor the most part in the deserts, and live solitary in the tops of the\r\nmountaines. There was nothing more horrible than the voice or braying of\r\nit, for the voice is strained above measure. It fighteth both with the\r\nmouth and with the heeles, with the mouth biting like a lyon, and with the\r\nheeles kicking like a horse.'\r\n\r\n\"Nor is belief in the unicorn confined to Europe. By Chinese writers it is\r\ncharacterised as a 'spiritual beast.' The existence of the unicorn is\r\nfirmly credited by the most intelligent natives and by not a few Europeans.\r\nA very trustworthy observer, the Abbé Huc, speaks very positively on the\r\nsubject: 'The unicorn really exists in Tibet.... We had for a long time a\r\nsmall Mongol treatise on Natural History, for the use of children, in which\r\na unicorn formed one of the pictorial illustrations.'\"\r\n\r\nThe unicorn, however, as it has heraldically developed, is drawn {222} with\r\nthe body of a horse, the tail of the heraldic lion, the legs and feet of\r\nthe deer, the head and mane of a horse, to which is added the long twisted\r\nhorn from which the animal is named, and a beard (Figs. 414, 415, and 416).\r\nA good representation of the unicorn will be found in the figure of the\r\nRoyal Arms herein, and in Fig. 417, which is as fine a piece of heraldic\r\ndesign as could be wished.\r\n\r\nThe crest of Yonge of Colbrooke, Devonshire, is \"a demi-sea-unicorn argent,\r\narmed gules, finned or,\" and the crest of Tynte (Kemeys-Tynte of Cefn Mably\r\nand Halswell) is \"on a mount vert, a unicorn sejant argent, armed and\r\ncrined or.\"\r\n\r\nThe unicorn will be found in the arms of Styleman, quartered by Le Strange,\r\nand Swanzy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 418.--Gryphon segreant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 419.--Gryphon passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 420.--Gryphon Statant.]\r\n\r\n_The Griffin_ or _Gryphon_.--Though in the popular mind any heraldic\r\nmonster is generically termed a griffin, the griffin has, nevertheless,\r\nvery marked and distinct peculiarities. It is one of the hybrid\r\nmonstrosities which heraldry is so fond of, and is formed by the body,\r\nhind-legs, and tail of a lion conjoined to the head and claws of an eagle,\r\nthe latter acting as its forepaws (Figs. 418-420). It has the wings of the\r\neagle, which are never represented close, but it also has ears, and this,\r\nby the way, should be noted, because herein is the only distinction between\r\na griffin's head and an eagle's head when the rest of the body is not\r\nrepresented (Fig. 421). Though but very seldom so met with, it is\r\noccasionally found proper, by which description is meant that the plumage\r\nis of the brown colour of the eagle, the rest of the body being the natural\r\ncolour of the lion. The griffin is frequently found with its beak and\r\nfore-legs of a different colour from its body, {223} and is then termed\r\n\"armed,\" though another term, \"beaked and fore-legged,\" is almost as\r\nfrequently used. A very popular idea is that the origin of the griffin was\r\nthe dimidiation of two coats of arms, one having an eagle and the other a\r\nlion as charges, but taking the origin of armory to belong to about the end\r\nof the eleventh century, or thereabouts, the griffin can be found as a\r\ndistinct creation, not necessarily heraldic, at a very much earlier date.\r\nAn exceedingly good and an early representation of the griffin will be\r\nfound in Fig. 422. It is a representation of the great seal of the town of\r\nSchweidnitz in the jurisdiction of Breslau, and belongs to the year 1315.\r\nThe inscription is \"+ S universitatis civium de Swidnitz.\" In the grant of\r\narms to the town in the year 1452, the griffin is gules on a field of\r\nargent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 422.--Seal of the Town of Schweidnitz.]\r\n\r\nThe griffin will be found in all sorts of positions, and the terms applied\r\nto it are the same as would be applied to a lion, except in the single\r\ninstance of the rampant position. A griffin is then termed \"segreant\" (Fig.\r\n418). The wings are usually represented as endorsed and erect, but this is\r\nnot compulsory, as will be noticed by reference to the supporters of the\r\nEarl of Mar and Kellie, in which the wings are inverted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 421.--Gryphon's head erased.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 423.--Male gryphon.]\r\n\r\nThere is a certain curiosity in English heraldry, wholly peculiar to it,\r\nwhich may be here referred to. A griffin in the ordinary way is merely so\r\ntermed, but a male griffin by some curious reasoning has no wings, but is\r\nadorned with spikes showing at some number of points on its body (Fig.\r\n423). I have, under my remarks upon the panther, hazarded the supposition\r\nthat the male griffin of English heraldry is nothing more than a British\r\ndevelopment and form of the Continental heraldic panther which is unknown\r\nto us. The origin of the clusters and spikes, unless they are to be found\r\nin the flames of fire associated with the panther, must remain a mystery.\r\nThe male griffin is very seldom met with, but two of these creatures are\r\nthe supporters of Sir George John Egerton Dashwood, Bart. Whilst we\r\nconsider the griffin a purely mythical animal, there is no doubt whatever\r\nthat earlier writers devoutly believed that such animals existed. Sir John\r\nMaundeville tells us in his \"Travels\" that they abound in Bacharia. \"Sum\r\nmen seyn that thei han the body upward as an egle, and benethe as a lyoun;\r\nand treuly thei seyn sothe that thei ben of that schapp. But a Griffoun\r\n{224} hathe the body more gret and more strong than eight lyouns of such\r\nlyouns as ben o' this half (of the world), and more gret and stronger than\r\nan 100 egles such as we han amonges us ...,\" and other writers, whilst not\r\nconsidering them an original type of animal, undoubtedly believed in their\r\nexistence as hybrid of the eagle and the lion. It is of course a well-known\r\nfact that the mule, the most popular hybrid, does not breed. This fact\r\nwould be accepted as accounting for the rarity of animals which were\r\nconsidered to be hybrids.\r\n\r\nThough there are examples of griffins in some of the earliest rolls of\r\narms, the animal cannot be said to have come into general use until a\r\nsomewhat later period. Nowadays, however, it is probably next in popularity\r\nto the lion.\r\n\r\nThe demi-griffin is very frequently found as a crest.\r\n\r\nA griffin's head (Fig. 421) is still yet more frequently met with, and as a\r\ncharge upon the shields it will be found in the arms of Raikes, Kay, and\r\nmany other families.\r\n\r\nA variety of the griffin is found in the gryphon-marine, or sea-griffin. In\r\nit the fore part of the creature is that of the eagle, but the wings are\r\nsometimes omitted; and the lower half of the animal is that of a fish, or\r\nrather of a mermaid. Such a creature is the charge in the arms of the\r\nSilesian family of Mestich: \"Argent, a sea-griffin proper\" (Siebmacher,\r\n_Wappenbuch_, i. 69). \"Azure, a (winged) sea-griffin per fesse gules and\r\nargent crowned or,\" is the coat of the Barons von Puttkammer. One or two\r\nother Pomeranian families have the like charge without wings.\r\n\r\n_The Dragon._--Much akin to the griffin is the dragon, but the similarity\r\nof appearance is more superficial than real, inasmuch as in all details it\r\ndiffers, except in the broad similarity that it has four legs, a pair of\r\nwings, and is a terrible creature. The much referred to \"griffin\" opposite\r\nthe Law Courts in the Strand is really a dragon. The head of a dragon is\r\nlike nothing else in heraldry, and from what source it originated or what\r\nbasis existed for ancient heraldic artists to imagine it from must remain a\r\nmystery, unless it has developed from the crocodile or some antediluvian\r\nanimal much akin. It is like nothing else in heaven or on earth. Its neck\r\nis covered with scales not unlike those of a fish. All four legs are scaled\r\nand have claws, the back is scaled, the tongue is barbed, and the under\r\npart of the body is likewise scaled, but here, in rolls of a much larger\r\nsize. Great differences will be found in the shape of the ears, but the\r\nwings of the dragon are always represented as the wings of a bat, with the\r\nlong ribs or bones carried to the base (Figs. 424-426). The dragon is one\r\nof the most artistic of heraldic creations, and lends itself very readily\r\nto the genius of any artist. In nearly all modern representations the tail,\r\nlike the tongue, {225} will be found ending in a barb, but it should be\r\nobserved that this is a comparatively recent addition. All dragons of the\r\nTudor period were invariably represented without any such additions to\r\ntheir tails. The tail was long and smooth, ending in a blunt point.\r\n\r\nWhilst we have separate and distinct names for many varieties of\r\ndragon-like creatures, other countries in their use of the word \"dragon\"\r\ninclude the wyvern, basilisk, cockatrice, and other similar creatures, but\r\nthe distinct name in German heraldry for our four-footed dragon is the\r\n_Lindwurm_, and Fig. 427 is a representation of the dragon according to\r\nGerman ideas, which nevertheless might form an example for English artists\r\nto copy, except that we very seldom represent ours as coward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 424.--Dragon rampant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 425.--Dragon passant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 426.--Dragon statant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 427.--A German dragon.]\r\n\r\nThe red dragon upon a mount vert, which forms a part of the Royal\r\nachievement as the badge of Wales, is known as the red dragon of\r\nCadwallader, and in deference to a loudly expressed sentiment on the\r\nsubject, His Majesty the King has recently added the Welsh dragon\r\ndifferenced by a label of three points argent as an additional badge to the\r\nachievement of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. The red dragon was\r\none of the supporters of the Tudor kings, being used by Henry VII., Henry\r\nVIII., and Edward VI. Queen Elizabeth, however, whose liking for gold is\r\nevidenced by her changing the Royal mantle from gules and ermine to gold\r\nand ermine, also changed the colour of the dragon as her supporter to gold,\r\nand many Welsh scholars hold that the ruddy dragon of Wales was and should\r\nbe of ruddy gold and not of gules. There is some room for doubt whether the\r\ndragon in the Royal Arms was really of Welsh origin. The point was\r\ndiscussed at some length by the present writer {226} in the _Genealogical\r\nMagazine_ (October 1902). It was certainly in use by King Henry III.\r\n\r\nA dragon may be statant (Fig. 426), rampant (Fig. 424), or passant (Fig.\r\n425), and the crests of Bicknell and of the late Sir Charles Young, Garter\r\nKing of Arms, are examples of dragons couchant.\r\n\r\nA sea-dragon, whatever that creature may be, occurs in one of the crests of\r\nMr. Mainwaring-Ellerker-Onslow.\r\n\r\nVariations such as that attributed to the family of Raynor [\"Argent, a\r\ndragon volant in bend sable\"], the dragon overthrown on the arms of\r\nLangridge as quartered by Lowdell, and the sinister supporter of the arms\r\nof Viscount Gough [\"The dragon of China or gorged with a mural crown and\r\nchained sable\"] may be noted. The Chinese dragon, which is also the dexter\r\nsupporter of Sir Robert Hart, Bart., follows closely the Chinese model, and\r\nis without wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 428.--Wyvern.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 429.--Wyvern with wings displayed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 430.--Wyvern erect.]\r\n\r\n_The Wyvern._--There is no difference whatever between a wyvern's head and\r\na dragon's, but there is considerable difference between a wyvern and a\r\ndragon, at any rate in English heraldry, though the wyvern appears to be\r\nthe form more frequently met with under the name of a dragon in other\r\ncountries. The wyvern has only two legs, the body curling away into the\r\ntail, and it is usually represented as resting upon its legs and tail\r\n(Figs. 428 and 429). On the other hand, it will occasionally be found\r\nsitting erect upon its tail with its claws in the air (Fig. 430), and the\r\nsupporters of the Duke of Marlborough are generally so represented. As a\r\ncharge or crest, however, probably the only instance of a wyvern sejant\r\nerect is the crest of Mansergh. A curious crest also is that of Langton,\r\nnamely: \"On a wreath of the colours, an eagle or and a wyvern vert,\r\ninterwoven and erect on their tails,\" and an equally curious one is the\r\ncrest of Maule, _i.e._ \"A wyvern vert, with two heads vomiting fire at both\r\nends proper, charged with a crescent argent.\"\r\n\r\nOccasionally the wyvern is represented without wings and with the {227}\r\ntail nowed. Both these peculiarities occur in the case of the crest of a\r\nLancashire family named Ffarington.\r\n\r\n_The Cockatrice._--The next variety is the cockatrice (Fig. 431), which is,\r\nhowever, comparatively rare. Two cockatrices are the supporters to the arms\r\nof the Earl of Westmeath, and also to the arms of Sir Edmund Charles\r\nNugent, Bart. But the animal is not common as a charge. The difference\r\nbetween a wyvern and a cockatrice is that the latter has the head of a cock\r\nsubstituted for the dragon's head with which the wyvern is decorated. Like\r\nthe cock, the beak, comb, and wattles are often of another tincture, and\r\nthe animal is then termed armed, combed, and wattled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 431.--Cockatrice.]\r\n\r\nThe cockatrice is sometimes termed a _basilisk_, and according to ancient\r\nwriters the basilisk is produced from an egg laid by a nine-year-old cock\r\nand hatched by a toad on a dunghill. Probably this is merely the expression\r\nof the intensified loathing which it was desired to typify. But the\r\nheraldic basilisk is stated to have its tail terminating in a dragon's\r\nhead. In English heraldry, at any rate, I know of no such example.\r\n\r\n_The Hydra_, or _Seven-headed Dragon_, as the crest, is ascribed to the\r\nfamilies of Barret, Crespine, and Lownes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 432.--Camelopard.]\r\n\r\n_The Camelopard_ (Fig. 432), which is nothing more or less than an ordinary\r\ngiraffe, must be properly included amongst mythical animals, because the\r\nform and semblance of the giraffe was used to represent a mythical hybrid\r\ncreation which the ancients believed to be begotten between a leopard and a\r\ncamel. Possibly they represented the real giraffe (which they may have\r\nknown), taking that to be a hybrid between the two animals stated. It\r\noccurs as the crest of several coats of arms for the name of Crisp.\r\n\r\n_The Camelopardel_, which is another mythical animal fathered upon armory,\r\nis stated to be the same as the camelopard, but with the addition of two\r\nlong horns curved backwards. I know of no instance in which it occurs.\r\n\r\nThe human face or figure conjoined to some other animal's body gives us a\r\nnumber of heraldic creatures, some of which play no inconsiderable part in\r\narmory.\r\n\r\nThe human figure (male) conjoined to the tail of a fish is known as the\r\n_Triton_ or _Merman_ (Fig. 433). Though there are some number of instances\r\nin which it occurs as a supporter, it is seldom met with as {228} a charge\r\nupon a shield. It is, however, to be found in the arms of Otway, and is\r\nassigned as a crest to the family of Tregent, and a family of Robertson, of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n_The Mermaid_ (Fig. 434), is much more frequently met with. It is generally\r\nrepresented with the traditional mirror and comb in the hands. It will be\r\nfound appearing, for example, in the arms of Ellis, of Glasfryn, co.\r\nMonmouth. The crest of Mason, used without authority by the founder of\r\nMason's College, led to its inclusion in the arms of the University of\r\nBirmingham. It will also be found as the crest of Rutherford and many other\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n_The Melusine, i.e._ a mermaid with two tails disposed on either side,\r\nthough not unknown in British heraldry, is more frequent in German.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 433.--Merman.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 434.--Mermaid.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 435.--Sphinx.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 436.--Centaur.]\r\n\r\n_The Sphinx_, of course originally derived from the Egyptian figure, has\r\nthe body, legs, and tail of a lion conjoined to the breasts, head, and face\r\nof a woman (Fig. 435). As a charge it occurs in the arms of Cochrane and\r\nCameron of Fassiefern. This last-mentioned coat affords a striking example\r\nof the over-elaboration to be found in so many of the grants which owe\r\ntheir origin to the Peninsular War and the other \"fightings\" in which\r\nEngland was engaged at the period. A winged sphinx is the crest of a family\r\nof the name of Asgile. Two sphinxes were granted as supporters to the late\r\nSir Edward Malet, G.C.B.\r\n\r\n_The Centaur_ (Fig. 436)--the familiar fabulous animal, half man, half\r\nhorse--is sometimes represented carrying a bow and arrow, when it is called\r\na \"sagittarius.\" It is not infrequently met with in heraldry, though it is\r\nto be found more often in Continental than in English blazonry. In its\r\n\"sagittarius\" form it is sculptured on a column in the Romanesque cloister\r\nof St. Aubin at Angers. It will be found as the crest of most families\r\nnamed Lambert, and it was one of the supporters of {229} Lord Hood of\r\nAvelon. It is also the crest of a family of Fletcher. A very curious crest\r\nwas borne by a family of Lambert, and is to be seen on their monuments.\r\nThey could establish no official authority for their arms as used, and\r\nconsequently obtained official authorisation in the early part of the\r\neighteenth century, when the crest then granted was a regulation\r\nsagittarius, but up to that time, however, they had always used a \"female\r\ncentaur\" holding a rose in its dexter hand.\r\n\r\n_Chimera._--This legendary animal happily does not figure in English\r\nheraldry, and but rarely abroad. It is described as having the head and\r\nbreast of a woman, the forepaws of a lion, the body of a goat, the\r\nhind-legs of a griffin, and the tail of a dragon, and would be about as\r\nugly and misbegotten a creature as can readily be imagined.\r\n\r\n_The Man-Lion_ will be found referred to under the heading of lions, and\r\nElvin mentions in addition the _Weir-Wolf, i.e._ the wolf with a human face\r\nand horns. Probably this creature has strayed into heraldic company by\r\nmistake. I know of no armorial use of it.\r\n\r\n_The Satyr_, which has a well-established existence in other than heraldic\r\nsources of imagination, is composed of a demi-savage united to the\r\nhind-legs of a goat.\r\n\r\n_The Satyral_ is a hybrid animal having the body of a lion and the face of\r\nan old man, with the horns of an antelope. I know of no instance of its\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n_The Harpy_--which is a curious creature consisting of the head, neck, and\r\nbreasts of a woman conjoined to the wings and body of a vulture--is\r\npeculiarly German, though it does exist in the heraldry of this country.\r\nThe German name for it is the _Jungfraunadler_. The shield of the\r\nRietbergs, Princes of Ost-Friesland, is: \"Sable, a harpy crowned, and with\r\nwings displayed all proper, between four stars, two in chief and as many in\r\nbase or.\" The harpy will be found as a crest in this country.\r\n\r\n_The Devil_ is not, as may be imagined, a favourite heraldic charge. The\r\narms of Sissinks of Groningen, however, are: \"Or, a horned devil having six\r\npaws, the body terminating in the tail of a fish all gules.\" The family of\r\nBawde have for a crest: \"A satyr's head in profile sable, with wings to the\r\nside of the head or, the tongue hanging out of his mouth gules.\" Though so\r\nblazoned, I feel sure it is really intended to represent a fiend. On the\r\nGarter Hall-plate of John de Grailly, Captal de Buch, the crest is a man's\r\nhead with ass's ears. This is, however, usually termed a Midas' head. A\r\ncertain coat of arms which is given in the \"General Armory\" under the name\r\nof Dannecourt, and also under the name of Morfyn or Murfyn, has for a\r\ncrest: \"A blackamoor's head couped at the shoulders, habited paly of six\r\nermine and ermines, pendents in his ears or, wreathed about the {230}\r\nforehead, with bat's wings to the head sable, expanded on each side.\"\r\n\r\nMany mythical animals can be more conveniently considered under their\r\nnatural counterparts. Of these the notes upon the heraldic antelope and the\r\nheraldic ibex accompany those upon the natural antelope, and the heraldic\r\npanther is included with the real animal. The heraldic tiger, likewise, is\r\nreferred to concurrently with the Bengal or natural tiger. The pegasus, the\r\nsea-horse, and the winged sea-horse are mentioned with other examples of\r\nthe horse, and the sea-dog is included with other breeds and varieties of\r\nthat useful animal. The winged bull, of which only one instance is known to\r\nme, occurs as the supporters of the Butchers' Livery Company, and has been\r\nalready alluded to, as also the winged stag. The sea-stag is referred to\r\nunder the sub-heading of stags. The two-headed lion, the double-queued\r\nlion, the lion queue-fourché, the sea-lion (which is sometimes found\r\nwinged) are all included in the chapter upon lions, as are also the winged\r\nlion and the lion-dragon. The winged ape was mentioned when considering the\r\nnatural animal, and perhaps it may be as well to allude to the asserted\r\nheraldic existence of the sea-monkey, though I am not aware of any instance\r\nin which it is borne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 437.--Salamander.]\r\n\r\nThe arms of Challoner afford an instance of the _Sea-Wolf_, the crest of\r\nthat family being: \"A demi-sea-wolf rampant or.\" Guillim, however (p. 271),\r\nin quoting the arms of Fennor, would seem to assert the sea-wolf and\r\nsea-dog to be one and the same. They certainly look rather like each other.\r\n\r\n_The Phoenix_ and the _Double-headed Eagle_ will naturally be more\r\nconveniently dealt with in the chapter upon the eagle.\r\n\r\n_The Salamander_ has been represented in various ways, and is usually\r\ndescribed as a dragon in flames of fire. It is sometimes so represented but\r\nwithout wings, though it more usually follows the shape of a lizard.\r\n\r\nThe salamander is, however, best known as the personal device of Francis\r\nI., King of France. It is to this origin that the arms of the city of Paris\r\ncan be traced.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the list of heraldic monsters can be very briefly\r\ndismissed. In many cases a good deal of research has failed to discover an\r\ninstance of their use, and one is almost inclined to believe that they were\r\ninvented by those mediæval writers of prolific imagination for their\r\ntreatises, without ever having been borne or emblazoned upon helmet or\r\nshield.\r\n\r\n_The Allocamelus_ is supposed to have the head of an ass conjoined {231} to\r\nthe body of a camel. I cannot call to mind any British instance of its use.\r\n\r\n_The Amphiptère_ is the term applied to a \"winged serpent,\" a charge of but\r\nrare occurrence in either English or foreign heraldry. It is found in the\r\narms of the French family of Potier, viz.: \"Azure, a bendlet purpure\r\nbetween two amphiptères or,\" while they figure as supporters also in that\r\nfamily, and in those of the Ducs de Tresmes and De Gevres.\r\n\r\n_The Apres_ is an animal with the body similar to that of a bull, but with\r\na bear's tail. It is seldom met with outside heraldic text-books.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 438.--Enfield.]\r\n\r\n_The Amphisboena_ is usually described as a winged serpent (with two legs)\r\nhaving a head at each end of its body, but in the crest of Gwilt [\"On a\r\nsaltire or, interlaced by two amphisboenæ azure, langued gules, a rose of\r\nthe last, barbed and seeded proper\"] the creatures certainly do not answer\r\nto the foregoing description. They must be seen to be duly appreciated.\r\n\r\n_The Cockfish_ is a very unusual charge, but it is to be met with in the\r\narms of the family of Geyss, in Bavaria, _i.e._: \"Or, a cock sable, beaked\r\nof the first, crested and armed gules, its body ending in that of a fish\r\ncurved upwards, proper.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 439.--Opinicus.]\r\n\r\n_The Enfield_ (Fig. 438) is a purely fanciful animal, having the head of a\r\nfox, chest of a greyhound, talons of an eagle, body of a lion, and hind\r\nlegs and tail of a wolf. It occurs as the crest of most Irish families of\r\nthe name of Kelly.\r\n\r\n_The Bagwyn_ is an imaginary animal with the head of and much like the\r\nheraldic antelope, but with the body and tail of a horse, and the horns\r\nlong and curved backwards. It is difficult to say what it is intended to\r\nrepresent, and I can give no instance in which it occurs.\r\n\r\n_The Musimon_ is a fabulous animal with the body and feet of a goat and the\r\nhead of a ram, with four horns. It is supposed to be the hybrid between the\r\nram and the goat, the four horns being the two straight ones of the goat\r\nand the two curled ones of the ram. Though no heraldic instance is known to\r\nme, one cannot definitely say such an animal never existed. Another name\r\nfor it is the tityron.\r\n\r\n_The Opinicus_ (Fig. 439) is another monster seldom met with in armory.\r\nWhen it does occur it is represented as a winged gryphon, with a lion's\r\nlegs and short tail. Another description of it gives it the {232} body and\r\nforelegs of a lion, the head, neck, and wings of an eagle, and the tail of\r\na camel. It is the crest of the Livery Company of Barbers in London, which\r\ndoubtless gives us the origin of it in the recent grant of arms to Sir\r\nFrederick Treves, Bart. Sometimes the wings are omitted.\r\n\r\n_The Manticora_, _Mantegre_, or _Man-Tiger_ is the same as the man-lion,\r\nbut has horns attached to its forehead.\r\n\r\n_The Hippogriff_ has the head, wings and foreclaws of the griffin united to\r\nthe hinder part of the body of a horse.\r\n\r\n_The Calopus_ or _Chatloup_ is a curious horned animal difficult to\r\ndescribe, but which appears to have been at one time the badge of the\r\nFoljambe family. No doubt, as the name would seem to indicate, it is a\r\nvariant of the wolf.\r\n\r\nMany of the foregoing animals, particularly those which are or are supposed\r\nto be hybrids, are, however well they may be depicted, ugly, inartistic,\r\nand unnecessary. Their representation leaves one with a disappointed\r\nfeeling of crudity of draughtmanship. No such objection applies to the\r\npegasus, the griffin, the sea-horse, the dragon, or the unicorn, and in\r\nthese modern days, when the differentiation of well-worn animals is\r\nproducing singularly inept results, one would urge that the sea-griffin,\r\nthe sea-stag, the winged bull, the winged stag, the winged lion, and winged\r\nheraldic antelope might produce (if the necessity of differentiation\r\ncontinue) very much happier results. {233}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nBIRDS\r\n\r\nBirds of course play a large and prominent part in heraldry. Those which\r\nhave been impressed into the service of heraldic emblazonment comprise\r\nalmost every species known to the zoological world.\r\n\r\nThough the earliest rolls of arms give us instances of various other birds,\r\nthe bird which makes the most prominent appearance is the _Eagle_, and in\r\nall early representations this will invariably be found \"displayed.\" A\r\ndouble-headed eagle displayed, from a Byzantine silk of the tenth century,\r\nis illustrated by Mr. Eve in his \"Decorative Heraldry,\" so that it is\r\nevident that neither the eagle displayed nor the double-headed eagle\r\noriginated with the science of armory, which appropriated them ready-made,\r\ntogether with their symbolism. An eagle displayed as a symbolical device\r\nwas certainly in use by Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps here be advantageous to treat of the artistic development of\r\nthe eagle displayed. Of this, of course, the earliest prototype is the\r\nRoman eagle of the Cæsars, and it will be to English eyes, accustomed to\r\nour conventional spread-eagle, doubtless rather startling to observe that\r\nthe German type of the eagle, which follows the Roman disposition of the\r\nwings (which so many of our heraldic artists at the present day appear\r\ninclined to adopt either in the accepted German or in a slightly modified\r\nform as an eagle displayed) is certainly not a true displayed eagle\r\naccording to our English ideas and requirements, inasmuch as the wings are\r\ninverted. It should be observed that in German heraldry it is simply termed\r\nan eagle, and not an eagle displayed. Considering, however, its very close\r\nresemblance to our eagle displayed, and also its very artistic appearance,\r\nthere is every excuse for its employment in this country, and I for one\r\nshould be sorry to observe its slowly increasing favour checked in this\r\ncountry. It is quite possible, however, to transfer the salient and\r\nstriking points of beauty to the more orthodox position of the wings. The\r\neagle (compared with the lion and the ordinaries) had no such predominance\r\nin early British heraldry that it enjoyed in Continental armory, and\r\ntherefore it may be better to trace the artistic development of the German\r\neagle. {234}\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the eagle appears with the head\r\nraised and the beak closed. The _sachsen_ (bones of the wings) are rolled\r\nup at the ends like a snail, and the pinions (like the talons) take a\r\nvertical downward direction. The tail, composed of a number of stiff\r\nfeathers, frequently issues from a knob or ball. Compare Fig. 440 herewith.\r\n\r\nWith the end of the fourteenth century the head straightens itself, the\r\nbeak opens and the tongue becomes visible. The rolling up of the wing-bones\r\ngradually disappears, and the claws form an acute angle with the direction\r\nof the body; and at this period the claws occasionally receive the \"hose\"\r\ncovering the upper part of the leg. The feathers of the tail spread out\r\nsicklewise (Fig. 441).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 440.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 441.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 442.]\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century shows the eagle with _sachsen_ forming a half circle,\r\nthe pinions spread out and radiating therefrom, and the claws more at a\r\nright angle (Fig. 442). The sixteenth century draws the eagle in a more\r\nferocious aspect, and depicts it in as ornamental and ornate a manner as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nFrom Konrad Grünenberg's _Wappenbuch_ (Constance, 1483) is reproduced the\r\nshield (Fig. 443) with the boldly sketched _Adlerflügel mit Schwerthand_\r\n(eagle's wing with the sword hand), the supposed arms of the Duke of\r\nCalabria.\r\n\r\nQuite in the same style is the eagle of Tyrol on a corporate flag of the\r\nSociety of the Schwazer Bergbute (Fig. 444), which belongs to the last\r\nquarter of the fifteenth century. This is reproduced from the impression in\r\nthe Bavarian National Museum given in Hefner-Alteneck's \"Book of Costumes.\"\r\n\r\nA modern German eagle drawn by H. G. Ströhl is shown in Fig. 445. The\r\nillustration is of the arms of the Prussian province of Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nThe double eagle has, of course, undergone a somewhat similar development.\r\n\r\nThe double eagle occurs in the East as well as in the West in very early\r\ntimes. Since about 1335 the double eagle has appeared sporadically as a\r\nsymbol of the Roman-German Empire, and under the Emperor Sigismund (d.\r\n1447) became the settled armorial device of the Roman Empire. King\r\nSigismund, before his coronation as Emperor, bore the single-headed eagle.\r\n\r\n{235}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 443.--Arms of Duke of Calabria.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 444.--Eagle of Tyrol.]\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be as well to point out, with the exception of the two\r\npositions \"displayed\" (Fig. 451) and \"close\" (Fig. 446), very little if any\r\nagreement at all exists amongst authorities either as to the terms to be\r\nemployed or as to the position intended for the wings when a given term is\r\nused in a blazon. Practically every other single position is simply\r\nblazoned \"rising,\" this term being employed without any additional\r\ndistinctive terms of variation in official blazons and emblazonments. Nor\r\ncan one obtain any certain information from a reference to the real eagle,\r\nfor the result of careful observation would seem to show that in the first\r\nstroke of the wings, when rising from the ground, the wings pass through\r\nevery position from the wide outstretched form, which I term \"rising with\r\nwings elevated and displayed\" (Fig. 450), to a position practically\r\n\"close.\" As a consequence, therefore, no one form can be said to be more\r\ncorrect than any other, either from the point of view of nature or from the\r\npoint of view of ancient precedent. This state of affairs is eminently\r\nunsatisfactory, because in these days of necessary differentiation no\r\nheraldic artist of any appreciable knowledge or ability has claimed the\r\nliberty (which certainly has not been officially conceded) to depict an\r\neagle rising with wings elevated and displayed, when it has been granted\r\nwith the wings in the position addorsed and inverted. Such a liberty when\r\nthe wings happen to be charged, as they so frequently are in modern English\r\ncrests, must clearly be an impossibility. {236}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 445.--Arms of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg.\r\n(From Ströhl's _Deutsche Wappenrolle_.)]\r\n\r\nUntil some agreement has been arrived at, I can only recommend my readers\r\nto follow the same plan which I have long adopted in blazoning arms of\r\nwhich the official blazon has not been available to me. That is, to use the\r\nterm \"rising,\" followed by the necessary description of the position of the\r\nwings (Figs. 447-450). This obviates both mistake and uncertainty.\r\nOriginally with us, as still in Germany, an eagle was always displayed, and\r\nin the days when coats of arms were few in number and simple in character\r\nthe artist may well have been permitted to draw an eagle as he chose,\r\nproviding it was an eagle. But arms and their elaboration in the last four\r\nhundred years have made this impossible. It is foolish to overlook this,\r\nand idle in the face of existing facts to attempt to revert to former ways.\r\nAlthough now the English eagle displayed has the tip of its wings pointed\r\nupwards (Fig. 451), and the contrary needs now to be mentioned in the\r\nblazon (Fig. 452), this even with us was not so in the beginning. A\r\nreference to Figs. 453 and 454 will show how the eagle was formerly\r\ndepicted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 446.--Eagle close.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 447.--Eagle rising, wings elevated and addorsed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 448.--Eagle rising, wings addorsed and inverted.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 449.--Eagle rising, wings displayed and inverted.]\r\n\r\n{237}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 450.--Eagle rising, wings elevated and displayed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 451.--Eagle displayed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 452.--Eagle displayed with wings inverted.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 453.--Arms of Ralph de Monthermer, Earl of Gloucester\r\nand Hereford: Or, an eagle vert. (From his seal, 1301.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 454.--Arms of Piers de Gaveston, Earl of Cornwall (d.\r\n1312): Vert, six eagles or.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 455.--Double-headed eagle displayed.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest instance of the eagle as a definitely heraldic charge upon a\r\nshield would appear to be its appearance upon the Great Seal of the\r\nMarkgrave Leopold of Austria in 1136, where the equestrian figure of the\r\nMarkgrave carries a shield so charged. More or less regularly, subsequently\r\nto the reign of Frederick Barbarossa, elected King of the Romans in 1152,\r\nand crowned as Emperor in 1155, the eagle with one or two heads (there\r\nseems originally to have been little unanimity upon the point) seems to\r\nhave become the recognised heraldic symbol of the Holy Roman Empire; and\r\nthe seal of Richard, Earl of Cornwall, elected King of the Romans in 1257,\r\nshows his arms [\"Argent, a lion rampant gules, within a bordure sable,\r\nbezanté\"] displayed upon the breast of an eagle; but no properly\r\nauthenticated contemporary instance of the use of this eagle by the Earl of\r\nCornwall is found in this country. The origin of the double-headed eagle\r\n(Fig. 455) has been the subject of endless controversy, the tale one is\r\nusually taught to believe being that it originated in the dimidiation upon\r\none shield of two separate coats {238} of arms. Nisbet states that the\r\nImperial eagle was \"not one eagle with two heads, but two eagles, the one\r\nlaid upon the other, and their heads separate, looking different ways,\r\nwhich represent the two heads of the Empire after it was divided into East\r\nand West.\" The whole discussion is an apt example of the habit of earlier\r\nwriters to find or provide hidden meanings and symbolisms when no such\r\nmeanings existed. The real truth undoubtedly is that the double-headed\r\neagle was an accepted figure long before heraldry came into existence, and\r\nthat when the displayed eagle was usurped by armory as one of its\r\npeculiarly heraldic figures, the single-headed and double-headed varieties\r\nwere used indifferently, until the double-headed eagle became stereotyped\r\nas the Imperial emblem. Napoleon, however, reverted to the single-headed\r\neagle, and the present German Imperial eagle has likewise only one head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 456.--Napoleonic Eagle.]\r\n\r\nThe Imperial eagle of Napoleon had little in keeping with then existing\r\narmorial types of the bird. There can be little doubt that the model upon\r\nwhich it was based was the Roman Eagle of the Cæsars as it figured upon the\r\nhead of the Roman standards. In English terms of blazon the Napoleonic\r\neagle would be: \"An eagle displayed with wings inverted, the head to the\r\nsinister, standing upon a thunderbolt or\" (Fig. 456).\r\n\r\nThe then existing double-headed eagles of Austria and Russia probably\r\nsupply the reason why, when the German Empire was created, the Prussian\r\neagle in a modified form was preferred to the resuscitation of the older\r\ndouble-headed eagle, which had theretofore been more usually accepted as\r\nthe symbol of Empire.\r\n\r\nBy the same curious idea which was noticed in the earlier chapter upon\r\nlions, and which ruled that the mere fact of the appearance of two or more\r\nlions rampant in the same coat of arms made them into lioncels, so more\r\nthan one eagle upon a shield resulted sometimes in the birds becoming\r\neaglets. Such a rule has never had official recognition, and no artistic\r\ndifference is made between the eagle and the eaglet. The charges on the\r\narms of Piers Gaveston, Earl of Cornwall, are blazoned as eagles (Fig.\r\n454). In the blazon of a few coats of arms, the term eaglet, however, still\r\nsurvives, _e.g._ in the arms of Child [\"Gules a chevron ermine, between\r\nthree eaglets close argent\"], and in the arms of Smitheman [\"Vert, three\r\neaglets statant with wings displayed argent, collared or\"].\r\n\r\nWhen an eagle has its beak of another colour, it is termed \"armed\" of that\r\ncolour, and when the legs differ it is termed \"membered.\" {239}\r\n\r\nAn eagle volant occurs in the crest of Jessel [\"On a wreath of the colours,\r\na torch fesswise, fired proper, surmounted by an eagle volant argent,\r\nholding in the beak a pearl also argent. Motto: 'Persevere'\"].\r\n\r\nParts of an eagle are almost as frequently met with as the entire bird.\r\nEagles' heads (Fig. 457) abound as crests (they can be distinguished from\r\nthe head of a griffin by the fact that the latter has always upstanding\r\nears).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 457.--Eagle's head couped.]\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise specified (_e.g._ the crest of the late Sir Noel Paton was\r\nbetween the two wings of a dove), wings occurring in armory are always\r\npresumed to be the wings of an eagle. This, however, in English heraldry\r\nhas little effect upon their design, for probably any well-conducted eagle\r\n(as any other bird) would disown the English heraldic wing, as it certainly\r\nwould never recognise the German heraldic variety. A pair of wings when\r\ndisplayed and conjoined at the base is termed \"conjoined in leure\" (Fig.\r\n458), from the palpable similarity of the figure in its appearance to the\r\nlure with which, thrown into the air, the falconer brought back his hawk to\r\nhand. The best known, and most frequently quoted instance, is the\r\nwell-known coat of Seymour or St. Maur [\"Gules, two wings conjoined in\r\nleure the tips downwards or\"]. It should always be stated if the wings (as\r\nin the arms of Seymour) are inverted. Otherwise the tips are naturally\r\npresumed to be in chief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 458.--A pair of wings conjoined in leure.]\r\n\r\nPairs of wings not conjoined can be met with in the arms and crest of\r\nBurne-Jones [\"Azure, on a bend sinister argent between seven mullets, four\r\nin chief and three in base or, three pairs of wings addorsed purpure,\r\ncharged with a mullet or. Crest: in front of fire proper two wings elevated\r\nand addorsed purpure, charged with a mullet or\"]; but two wings, unless\r\nconjoined or addorsed, will not usually be described as a pair.\r\nOccasionally, however, a pair of wings will be found in saltire, but such a\r\ndisposition is most unusual. Single wings, unless specified to be the\r\ncontrary, are presumed to be dexter wings.\r\n\r\nCare needs to be exercised in some crests to observe the difference between\r\n(_a_) a bird's head between two wings, (_b_) a bird's head winged (a form\r\nnot often met with, but in which rather more of the neck is shown, and the\r\nwings are conjoined thereto), and (_c_) a bird's head between two wings\r\naddorsed. The latter form, which of course is really {240} no more than a\r\nrepresentation of a crest between two wings turned to be represented upon a\r\nprofile helmet, is one of the painful results of our absurd position rules\r\nfor the helmet.\r\n\r\nA pair of wings conjoined is sometimes termed a vol, and one wing a\r\ndemi-vol. Though doubtless it is desirable to know these terms, they are\r\nbut seldom found in use, and are really entirely French.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 459.--An eagle's leg erased à la quise.]\r\n\r\nEagles' legs are by no means an infrequent charge. They will usually be\r\nfound erased at the thigh, for which there is a recognised term \"erased à\r\nla quise\" (Fig. 459), which, however, is by no means a compulsory one. An\r\neagle's leg so erased was a badge of the house of Stanley. The eagle's leg\r\nwill sometimes be met with couped below the feathers, but would then be\r\nmore properly described as a claw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 460.--Phoenix.]\r\n\r\nA curious form of the eagle is found in the _alerion_, which is represented\r\nwithout beak or legs. It is difficult to conjecture what may have been the\r\norigin of the bird in this debased form, unless its first beginnings may be\r\ntaken as a result of the unthinking perpetuation of some crudely drawn\r\nexample. Its best-known appearance is, of course, in the arms of Loraine;\r\nand as Planché has pointed out, this is as perfect an example of a canting\r\nanagram as can be met with in armory.\r\n\r\n_The Phoenix_ (Fig. 460), one of the few mythical birds which heraldry has\r\nfamiliarised us with, is another, and perhaps the most patent example of\r\nall, of the appropriation by heraldic art of an ancient symbol, with its\r\nsymbolism ready made. It belongs to the period of Grecian mythology. As a\r\ncharge upon a shield it is comparatively rare, though it so occurs in the\r\narms of Samuelson. On the other hand, it is frequently to be found as a\r\ncrest. It is always represented as a demi-eagle issuing from flames of\r\nfire, and though the flames of fire will generally be found mentioned in\r\nthe verbal blazon, this is not essential. Without its fiery surroundings it\r\nwould cease to be a phoenix. On the other hand, though it is always\r\ndepicted as a _demi_-bird (no instance to the contrary exists), it is never\r\nconsidered necessary to so specify it. It occurs as the crest of the\r\nSeymour family [\"Out of a ducal coronet a phoenix issuant from flames of\r\nfire\"].\r\n\r\nPLATE IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_The Osprey_ may perhaps be here mentioned, because its heraldic {241}\r\nrepresentation always shows it as a white eagle. It is however seldom met\r\nwith, though it figures in the crests of Roche (Lord Fermoy) and Trist. The\r\nosprey is sometimes known as the sea-eagle, and heraldically so termed.\r\n\r\n_The Vulture_ (probably from its repulsive appearance in nature and its\r\nequally repulsive habits) is not a heraldic favourite. Two of these birds\r\noccur, however, as the supporters of Lord Graves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 461.--Falcon.]\r\n\r\n_The Falcon_ (Fig. 461) naturally falls next to the eagle for\r\nconsideration. Considering the very important part this bird played in the\r\nsocial life of earlier centuries, this cannot be a matter of any surprise.\r\nHeraldry, in its emblazonment, makes no distinction between the appearance\r\nof the hawk and the falcon, but for canting and other reasons the bird will\r\nbe found described by all its different names, _e.g._ in the arms of\r\nHobson, to preserve the obvious pun, the two birds are blazoned as hobbies.\r\n\r\nThe falcon is frequently (more often than not) found belled. With the\r\nslovenliness (or some may exalt it into the virtue of freedom from\r\nirritating restriction) characteristic of many matters in heraldic blazon,\r\nthe simple term \"belled\" is found used indiscriminately to signify that the\r\nfalcon is belled on one leg or belled on both, and if it is belled the bell\r\nmust of necessity be on a jess. Others state that every falcon must of\r\nnecessity (whether so blazoned or not) be belled upon at least one leg, and\r\nthat when the term \"belled\" is used it signifies that it is belled upon\r\nboth legs. There is still yet another alternative, viz. that when \"belled\"\r\nit has the bell on only one leg, but that when \"jessed and belled\" it is\r\nbelled on both legs. The jess is the leather thong with which the bells are\r\nattached to the leg, and it is generally considered, and this may be\r\naccepted, that when the term \"jessed\" is included in the wording of the\r\nblazon the jesses are represented with the ends flying loose, unless the\r\nuse of the term is necessitated by the jesses being of a different colour.\r\nWhen the term \"vervelled\" is also employed it signifies that the jesses\r\nhave small rings attached to the floating ends. In actual practice,\r\nhowever, it should be remembered that if the bells and jesses are of a\r\ndifferent colour, the use of the terms \"jessed\" and \"belled\" is essential.\r\nA falcon is seldom drawn without at least one bell, and when it is found\r\ndescribed as \"belled,\" in most cases it will be found that the intention is\r\nthat it shall have two bells.\r\n\r\nLike all other birds of prey the falcon may be \"armed,\" a technical term\r\nwhich theoretically should include the beak and legs, but in actual {242}\r\npractice a falcon will be far more usually found described as \"beaked and\r\nlegged\" when these differ in tincture from its plumage.\r\n\r\nWhen a falcon is blindfolded it is termed \"hooded.\" It was always so\r\ncarried on the wrist until it was flown.\r\n\r\nThe position of the wings and the confusion in the terms applied thereto is\r\neven more marked in the case of the falcon than the eagle.\r\n\r\nDemi-falcons are not very frequently met with, but an example occurs in the\r\ncrest of Jerningham.\r\n\r\nA falcon's head is constantly met with as a crest.\r\n\r\nWhen a falcon is represented preying upon anything it is termed \"trussing\"\r\nits prey, though sometimes the description \"preying upon\" is (perhaps less\r\naccurately) employed. Examples of this will be found in the arms of Madden\r\n[\"Sable, a hawk or, trussing a mallard proper, on a chief of the second a\r\ncross botonny gules\"], and in the crests of Graham, Cawston, and Yerburgh.\r\n\r\nA falcon's leg appears in the crest of Joscelin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 462.--Pelican in her piety.]\r\n\r\n_The Pelican_, with its curious heraldic representation and its strange\r\nterms, may almost be considered an instance of the application of the\r\nexisting name of a bird to an entirely fanciful creation. Mr. G. W. Eve, in\r\nhis \"Decorative Heraldry,\" states that in early representations of the bird\r\nit was depicted in a more naturalistic form, but I confess I have not\r\nmyself met with such an ancient representation.\r\n\r\nHeraldically, it has been practically always depicted with the head and\r\nbody of an eagle, with wings elevated and with the neck embowed, pecking\r\nwith its beak at its breast. The term for this is \"vulning itself,\" and\r\nalthough it appears to be necessary always to describe it in the blazon as\r\n\"vulning itself,\" it will never be met with save in this position; a\r\npelican's head even, when erased at the neck, being always so represented.\r\nIt is supposed to be pecking at its breast to provide drops of blood as\r\nnourishment for its young, and it is termed \"in its piety\" when depicted\r\nstanding in its nest and with its brood of young (Fig. 462). It is\r\ndifficult to imagine how the pelican came to be considered as always\r\nexisting in this position, because there is nothing in the nature of a\r\nnatural habit from which this could be derived. There are, however, other\r\nbirds which, during the brooding season, lose their feathers upon the\r\nbreast, and some which grow red feathers there, and it is doubtless from\r\nthis that the idea originated.\r\n\r\nIn heraldic and ecclesiastical symbolism the pelican has acquired a\r\nsomewhat sacred character as typical of maternal solicitude. It {243} will\r\nnever be found \"close,\" or in any other positions than with the wings\r\nendorsed and either elevated or inverted.\r\n\r\nWhen blazoned \"proper,\" it is always given the colour and plumage of the\r\neagle, and not its natural colour of white. In recent years, however, a\r\ntendency has rather made itself manifest to give the pelican its natural\r\nand more ungainly appearance, and its curious pouched beak.\r\n\r\n_The Ostrich_ (Fig. 463) is doubtless the bird which is most frequently met\r\nwith as a crest after the falcon, unless it be the dove or martlet. The\r\nostrich is heraldically emblazoned in a very natural manner, and it is\r\ndifficult to understand why in the case of such a bird heraldic artists of\r\nearlier days should have remained so true to the natural form of the bird,\r\nwhilst in other cases, in which they could have had no less intimate\r\nacquaintance with the bird, greater variation is to be found.\r\n\r\nAs a charge upon a shield it is not very common, although instances are to\r\nbe found in the arms of MacMahon [\"Argent, an ostrich sable, in its beak a\r\nhorse-shoe or\"], and in the arms of Mahon [\"Per fess sable and argent, an\r\nostrich counterchanged, holding in its beak a horse-shoe or\"].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 463.--Ostrich.]\r\n\r\nIt is curious that, until quite recent times, the ostrich is never met with\r\nheraldically, unless holding a horse-shoe, a key, or some other piece of\r\nold iron in its beak. The digestive capacity of the ostrich, though\r\nsomewhat exaggerated, is by no means fabulous, and in the earliest forms of\r\nits representation in all the old natural history books it is depicted\r\nfeeding upon this unnatural food. If this were the popular idea of the\r\nbird, small wonder is it that heraldic artists perpetuated the idea, and\r\neven now the heraldic ostrich is seldom seen without a key or a horse-shoe\r\nin its beak.\r\n\r\nThe ostrich's head alone is sometimes met with, as in the crest of the Earl\r\nof Carysfort.\r\n\r\nThe wing of an ostrich charged with a bend sable is the crest of a family\r\nof Gulston, but an ostrich wing is by no means a usual heraldic charge.\r\n\r\nOstrich feathers, of course, play a large part in armory, but the\r\nconsideration of these may be postponed for the moment until the feathers\r\nof cocks and peacocks can be added thereto.\r\n\r\n_The Dove_--at least the heraldic bird--has one curious peculiarity. It is\r\nalways represented with a slight tuft on its head. Mr. Eve considers this\r\nto be merely the perpetuation of some case in which the crude draughtsman\r\nhas added a tuft to its head. Possibly he is {244} correct, but I think it\r\nmay be an attempt to distinguish between the domestic dove and the\r\nwood-pigeon--both of which varieties would be known to the early heraldic\r\nartists.\r\n\r\nThe dove with an olive branch in its beak is constantly and continually met\r\nwith. When blazoned \"proper\" it is quite correct to make the legs and feet\r\nof the natural pinky colour, but it will be more usually found that a dove\r\nis specifically described as \"legged gules.\"\r\n\r\nThe ordinary heraldic dove will be found most frequently represented with\r\nits wings close and holding a branch of laurel in its beak, but it also\r\noccurs volant and with outstretched wings. It is then frequently termed a\r\n\"dove rising.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 464.--Dove.]\r\n\r\nThe doves in the arms of the College of Arms are always represented with\r\nthe sinister wing close, and the dexter wing extended and inverted. This\r\nhas given rise to much curious speculation; but whatever may be the reason\r\nof the curious position of the wings, there can be very little doubt that\r\nthe coat of arms itself is based upon the coat of St. Edward the Confessor.\r\nThe so-called coat of St. Edward the Confessor is a cross patonce between\r\nfive martlets, but it is pretty generally agreed that these martlets are a\r\ncorruption of the doves which figure upon his coins, and one of which\r\nsurmounts the sceptre which is known as St. Edward's staff, or \"the sceptre\r\nwith the dove.\"\r\n\r\n_The Wood-Pigeon_ is not often met with, but it does occur, as in the crest\r\nof the arms of Bradbury [\"On a wreath of the colours, in front of a\r\ndemi-wood-pigeon, wings displayed and elevated argent, each wing charged\r\nwith a round buckle tongue pendent sable, and holding in the beak a sprig\r\nof barberry, the trunk of a tree fesswise eradicated, and sprouting to the\r\ndexter, both proper \"].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 465.--Martlet.]\r\n\r\n_The Martlet_ is another example of the curious perpetuation in heraldry of\r\nthe popular errors of natural history. Even at the present day, in many\r\nparts of the country, it is popularly believed that a swallow has no feet,\r\nor, at any rate, cannot perch upon the ground, or raise itself therefrom.\r\nThe fact that one never does see a swallow upon the ground supports the\r\nfoundation of the idea. At any rate the heraldic swallow, which is known as\r\nthe martlet, is never represented with feet, the legs terminating in the\r\nfeathers which cover the upper parts of the leg (Fig. 465). It is curious\r\nthat the same idea is perpetuated in the little legend of the explanation,\r\nwhich may or may {245} not be wholly untrue, that the reason the martlet\r\nhas been adopted as the mark of cadency for the fourth son is to typify the\r\nfact that whilst the eldest son succeeds to his father's lands, and whilst\r\nthe second son may succeed, perhaps, to the mother's, there can be very\r\nlittle doubt that by the time the fourth son is reached, there is no land\r\nremaining upon which he can settle, and that he must, perforce, fly away\r\nfrom the homestead to gather him means elsewhere. At any rate, whether this\r\nbe true or false, the martlet certainly is never represented in heraldry\r\nwith feet. If the feet are shown, the bird becomes a swallow.\r\n\r\nMost heraldry books state also that the martlet has no beak. How such an\r\nidea originated I am at a loss to understand, because I have never yet come\r\nacross an official instance in which the martlet is so depicted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 466.--Martlet volant.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the confusion between the foreign merlette--which is drawn like a\r\nduck without wings, feet, or forked tail--and the martlet may account for\r\nthe idea that the martlet should be depicted without a beak.\r\n\r\nIt is very seldom that the martlet occurs except close, and consequently it\r\nis never so specified in blazon. An instance, however, in which it occurs\r\n\"rising\" will be found in the crest of a family of Smith, and there are a\r\nnumber of instances in which it is volant (Fig. 466).\r\n\r\n_The Swallow_, as distinct from the martlet, is sometimes met with.\r\n\r\nA swallow \"volant\" appears upon the arms usually ascribed to the town of\r\nArundel. These, however, are not recorded as arms in the Visitation books,\r\nthe design being merely noted as a seal device, and one hesitates to assert\r\ndefinitely what the status of the design in question may be. The pun upon\r\n\"l'hirondelle\" was too good for ancient heralds to pass by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 467.--Swan.]\r\n\r\n_The Swan_ (Fig. 467) is a very favourite charge, and will be found both as\r\na crest and as a charge upon a shield, and in all varieties of position. It\r\nis usually, however, when appearing as a charge, to be found \"close.\" A\r\nswan couchant appears as the crest of Barttelot, a swan regardant as the\r\ncrest of Swaby, and a swan \"rising\" will be found as a crest of Guise and\r\nas a charge upon the arms of Muntz. Swimming in water it occurs in the\r\ncrest of Stilwell, and a swan to which the unusual term of \"rousant\" is\r\nsometimes applied figures as {246} the crest of Stafford: \"Out of a ducal\r\ncoronet per pale gules and sable, a demi-swan rousant, wings elevated and\r\ndisplayed argent, beaked gules.\" It is, however, more usually blazoned as:\r\n\"A demi-swan issuant (from the coronet, per pale gules and sable\").\r\n\r\nSwans' heads and necks are not often met with as a charge, though they\r\noccur in the arms of Baker. As a crest they are very common, and will be\r\nfound in the cases of Lindsay and Bates.\r\n\r\n_The Duck_--with its varieties of the moorhen and eider-duck--is sometimes\r\nmet with, and appears in the arms of Duckworth and Billiat. Few better\r\ncanting examples can be found than the latter coat, in which the duck is\r\nholding the billet in its bill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 468.--Cock.]\r\n\r\nThe other domestic bird--the _Cock_--is often met with, though it more\r\noften figures as a crest than upon a shield. A cock \"proper\" is generally\r\nrepresented of the kind which in farmyard phraseology is known as a\r\ngamecock (Fig. 468). Nevertheless the gamecock--as such--does occur; though\r\nin these cases, when so blazoned, it is usually depicted in the artificial\r\nform--deprived of its comb and wattles, as was the case when it was\r\nprepared for cock-fighting. Birds of this class are usually met with, with\r\na comb and wattles, &c., of a different colour, and are then termed \"combed\r\n(or crested), wattled, and jelopped\"--if it is desired to be strictly\r\naccurate--though it will be generally found that the term is dropped to\r\n\"combed and jelopped.\" If the bird is termed \"armed,\" the beak and spurs\r\nare thereby referred to. It occurs in the arms of Handcock (Lord\r\nCastlemaine) [\"Ermine, on a chief sable, a dexter hand between two cocks\r\nargent\"] and in the arms of Cokayne [\"Argent, three cocks gules, armed,\r\ncrested, and jelopped sable\"], and also in that of Law. It likewise occurs\r\nin the arms of Aitken.\r\n\r\n_The Sheldrake_ appears occasionally under another name, _i.e._ that of the\r\n_Shoveller_, and as such will be found in the arms of Jackson, of\r\nDoncaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 469.--Peacock in his pride.]\r\n\r\nThe gorgeous plumage of the _Peacock_ has of course resulted in its\r\nfrequent employment. It has a special term of its own, being stated to be\r\n\"in his pride\" when shown affronté, and with the tail displayed (Fig. 469).\r\nIt is seldom met with except in this position, though the well-known crest\r\nof Harcourt is an example to the contrary, as is the crest of Sir Jamsetjee\r\nJejeebhoy, Bart., viz. \"A mount vert, thereon {247} a peacock amidst wheat,\r\nand in the beak an ear of wheat all proper.\" With the tail closed it also\r\nfigures as one of the supporters of Sir Robert Hart, Bart. [\"Sinister, a\r\npeacock close proper\"]: its only appearance in such a position that I am\r\naware of.\r\n\r\nA peacock's tail is not a familiar figure in British armory, though the\r\nexact contrary is the case in German practices. \"Issuant from the mouth of\r\na boar's head erect\" it occurs as the crest of Tyrell, and \"A plume of\r\npeacock's feathers\"--which perhaps is the same thing--\"issuant from the\r\nside of a chapeau\" is the crest of Lord Sefton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 470.--Crane in its vigilance.]\r\n\r\nAnother bird for which heraldry has created a term of its own is the\r\n_Crane_. It is seldom met with except holding a stone in its claw, the term\r\nfor which stone is its \"vigilance,\" a curious old fable, which explains the\r\nwhole matter, being that the crane held the stone in its foot so that if by\r\nany chance it fell asleep, the stone, by dropping, would awaken it, and\r\nthus act as its \"vigilance\" (Fig. 470). It is a pity that the truth of such\r\na charming example of the old world should be dissipated by the fact that\r\nthe crest of Cranstoun is the crane _asleep_--or rather dormant--with its\r\nhead under its wing, and nevertheless holding its \"vigilance\" in its foot!\r\nThe crane is not often met with, but it occurs in the arms of Cranstoun,\r\nwith the curious and rather perplexing motto, \"Thou shalt want ere I want.\"\r\nBefore leaving the crane, it may be of interest to observe that the\r\nderivation of the word \"pedigree\" is from _pied de grue_, the appearance of\r\na crane's foot and the branching lines indicative of issue being similar in\r\nshape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 471.--Stork holding in its beak a snake.]\r\n\r\nHeraldic representation makes little if any difference when depicting a\r\ncrane, a stork, or a heron, except that the tuft on the head of the latter\r\nis never omitted when a heron is intended.\r\n\r\nInstances of the _Stork_ are of fairly frequent occurrence, the usual\r\nheraldic method of depicting the bird being with the wings close.\r\n\r\nMore often than not the stork is met with a snake in its beak (Fig. 471);\r\nand the fact that a heron is also generally provided with an eel to play\r\nwith adds to the confusion.\r\n\r\n_The Heron_--or, as it was anciently more frequently termed heraldically,\r\nthe _Herne_ (Fig. 472)--will naturally be found in the arms of Hearne and\r\nsome number of other coats and crests. {248}\r\n\r\n_The Raven_ (Fig. 473) occurs almost as early as any other heraldic bird.\r\nIt is said to have been a Danish device. The powerful Norman family of\r\nCorbet, one of the few remaining families which can show an unbroken male\r\ndescent from the time of the Conquest to the present day, have always\r\nremained faithful to the raven, though they have added to it sometimes a\r\n_bordure_ or additional numbers of its kind. \"Or, a raven sable,\" the\r\nwell-known Corbet coat, is, of course, a canting allusion to their Norman\r\nname, or nickname, \"Le Corbeau.\" Their name, like their pedigree, is\r\nunique, inasmuch as it is one of the few names of undoubted Norman origin\r\nwhich are not territorial, and possibly the fact that their lands of\r\nMoreton Corbett, one of their chief seats, were known by their name has\r\nassisted in the perpetuation of what was, originally, undoubtedly a\r\npersonal nickname.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 472.--Heron.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 473.--Raven.]\r\n\r\nFig. 474 is a striking example of the virility which can be imparted to the\r\nraven. It is reproduced from Grünenberg's \"Book of Arms\" (1483). Ströhl\r\nsuggests it may be of \"Corbie\" in Picardy, but the identity of the arms\r\nleads one to fancy the name attached may be a misdescription of the English\r\nfamily of Corbet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 474.]\r\n\r\nHeraldically, no difference is made in depicting the raven, the rook, and\r\nthe crow; and examples of the Crow will be found in the arms of Crawhall,\r\nand of the _Rook_ in the crest of Abraham. The arms of the Yorkshire family\r\nof Creyke are always blazoned as rooks, but I am inclined to think they may\r\npossibly have been originally _creykes_, or corn-crakes.\r\n\r\n_The Cornish Chough_ is very much more frequently met with than either the\r\ncrow, rook, or raven, and it occurs in the arms of Bewley, the town of\r\nCanterbury, and (as a crest) of Cornwall.\r\n\r\nIt can only be distinguished from the raven in heraldic representations by\r\nthe fact that the Cornish chough is always depicted and frequently blazoned\r\nas \"beaked and legged gules,\" as it is found in its natural state. {249}\r\n\r\n_The Owl_ (Fig. 475), too, is a very favourite bird. It is always depicted\r\nwith the face affronté, though the body is not usually so placed. It occurs\r\nin the arms of Leeds--which, by the way, are an example of colour upon\r\ncolour--Oldham, and Dewsbury. In the crest of Brimacombe the wings are\r\nopen, a most unusual position.\r\n\r\n_The Lark_ will be found in many cases of arms or crests for families of\r\nthe name of Clarke.\r\n\r\n_The Parrot_, or, as it is more frequently termed heraldically, the\r\n_Popinjay_ (Fig. 476), will be found in the arms of Lumley and other\r\nfamilies. It also occurs in the arms of Curzon: \"Argent, on a bend sable\r\nthree popinjays or, collared gules.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 475.--Owl.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 476.--Popinjay.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 477.--Moorcock.]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing about the bird, or its representations, which needs\r\nspecial remark, and its usual heraldic form follows nature pretty closely.\r\n\r\n_The Moorcock_ or _Heathcock_ is curious, inasmuch as there are two\r\ndistinct forms in which it is depicted. Neither of them are correct from\r\nthe natural point of view, and they seem to be pretty well interchangeable\r\nfrom the heraldic point of view. The bird is always represented with the\r\nhead and body of an ordinary cock, but sometimes it is given the wide flat\r\ntail of black game, and sometimes a curious tail of two or more erect\r\nfeathers at right angles to its body (Fig. 477).\r\n\r\nThough usually represented close, it occurs sometimes with open wings, as\r\nin the crest of a certain family of Moore.\r\n\r\nMany other birds are to be met with in heraldry, but they have nothing at\r\nall especial in their bearing, and no special rules govern them.\r\n\r\n_The Lapwing_, under its alternative names of _Peewhit_, _Plover_, and\r\n_Tyrwhitt_, will be found in the arms of Downes, Tyrwhitt, and Tweedy.\r\n\r\n_The Pheasant_ will be found in the crest of Scott-Gatty, and the\r\n_Kingfisher_ in many cases of arms of the name of Fisher. {250}\r\n\r\n_The Magpie_ occurs in the arms of Dusgate, and in those of Finch.\r\n\r\nWoodward mentions an instance in which the _Bird of Paradise_ occurs (p.\r\n267); \"Argent, on a terrace vert, a cannon mounted or, supporting a Bird of\r\nParadise proper\" [Rjevski and Yeropkin]; and the arms of Thornton show upon\r\na canton the Swedish bird _tjader_: \"Ermine, a chevron sable between three\r\nhawthorn trees eradicated proper, a canton or, thereon the Swedish bird\r\ntjader, or cock of the wood, also proper.\" Two similar birds were granted\r\nto the first Sir Edward Thornton, G.C.B., as supporters, he being a Knight\r\nGrand Cross.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 478.--The \"Shield for Peace\" of Edward the Black Prince\r\n(d. 1376): Sable, three ostrich feathers with scrolls argent. (From his\r\ntomb in Canterbury Cathedral.)]\r\n\r\nSingle feathers as charges upon a shield are sometimes met with, as in the\r\n\"shield for peace\" of Edward the Black Prince (Fig. 478) and in the arms of\r\nClarendon. These two examples are, however, derivatives from the historic\r\nostrich-feather badges of the English Royal Family, and will be more\r\nconveniently dealt with later when considering the subject of badges. The\r\nsingle feather enfiled by the circlet of crosses patée and fleurs-de-lis,\r\nwhich is borne upon a canton of augmentation upon the arms of Gull, Bart.,\r\nis likewise a derivative, but feathers as a charge occur in the arms of\r\nJervis: \"Argent, six ostrich feathers, three, two, and one sable.\" A modern\r\ncoat founded upon this, in which the ostrich feathers are placed upon a\r\npile, between two bombshells fracted in base, belongs to a family of a very\r\nsimilar name, and the crest granted therewith is a single ostrich feather\r\nbetween two bombs fired. Cock's feathers occur as charges in the arms of\r\nGalpin.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the crest, feathers are constantly to be found, which is not\r\nto be wondered at, inasmuch as fighting and tournament helmets, when\r\nactually in use, frequently did not carry the actual crests of the owners,\r\nbut were simply adorned with the plume of ostrich feathers. A curious\r\ninstance of this will be found in the case of the family of Dymoke of\r\nScrivelsby, the Honourable the King's Champions. The crest is really: \"Upon\r\na wreath of the colours, the two ears of an ass sable,\" though other crests\r\n[\"1. a sword erect proper; 2. a lion as in the arms\"] are sometimes made\r\nuse of. When the Champion performs his service at a Coronation the shield\r\nwhich is carried by his esquire is not that of his sovereign, but is\r\nemblazoned with his personal arms of Dymoke: \"Sable, two lions passant in\r\npale argent, ducally crowned or.\" The helmet of the Champion is decorated\r\nwith a triple plume of ostrich feathers and not with the Dymoke crest. In\r\n{251} old representations of tournaments and warfare the helmet will far\r\noftener be found simply adorned with a plume of ostrich feathers than with\r\na heritable crest, and consequently such a plume has remained in use as the\r\ncrest of a very large number of families. This point is, however, more\r\nfully dealt with in the chapter upon crests.\r\n\r\nThe plume of ostrich feathers is, moreover, attributed as a crest to a far\r\ngreater number of families than it really belongs to, because if a family\r\npossessed no crest the helmet was generally ornamented with a plume of\r\nostrich feathers, which later generations have accepted and adopted as\r\ntheir heritable crest, when it never possessed such a character. A notable\r\ninstance of this will be found in the crest of Astley, as given in the\r\nPeerage Books.\r\n\r\nThe number of feathers in a plume requires to be stated; it will usually be\r\nfound to be three, five, or seven, though sometimes a larger number are met\r\nwith. When it is termed a double plume they are arranged in two rows, the\r\none issuing above the other, and a triple plume is arranged in three rows;\r\nand though it is correct to speak of any number of feathers as a plume, it\r\nwill usually be found that the word is reserved for five or more, whilst a\r\nplume of three feathers would more frequently be termed three ostrich\r\nfeathers. Whilst they are usually white, they are also found of varied\r\ncolours, and there is even an instance to be met with of ostrich feathers\r\nof ermine. When the feathers are of different colours they need to be\r\ncarefully blazoned; if alternately, it is enough to use the word\r\n\"alternately,\" the feather at the extreme dexter side being depicted of the\r\ncolour first mentioned. In a plume which is of three colours, care must be\r\nused in noting the arrangement of the colours, the colours first mentioned\r\nbeing that of the dexter feather; the others then follow from dexter to\r\nsinister, the fourth feather commencing the series of colours again. If any\r\nother arrangement of the colours occurs it must be specifically detailed.\r\nThe rainbow-hued plume from which the crest of Sir Reginald Barnewall[19]\r\nissues is the most variegated instance I have met with.\r\n\r\nTwo peacock's feathers in saltire will be found in the crest of a family of\r\nGatehouse, and also occur in the crest of Crisp-Molineux-Montgomerie. The\r\npen in heraldry is always of course of the quill variety, and consequently\r\nshould not be mistaken for a single feather. The term \"penned\" is used when\r\nthe quill of a feather is of a different colour from the remainder of it.\r\nOstrich and other feathers are very frequently found on either side of a\r\ncrest, both in British and Continental armory; but though often met with in\r\nthis position, there is nothing peculiar about this use in such character.\r\nGerman heraldry {252} has evolved one use of the peacock's feather, or\r\nrather for the eye from the peacock's feather, which happily has not yet\r\nreached this country. It will be found adorning the outer edges of every\r\nkind of object, and it even occurs on occasion as a kind of dorsal fin down\r\nthe back of animals. Bunches of cock's feathers are also frequently made\r\nuse of for the same purpose. There has been considerable diversity in the\r\nmethod of depicting the ostrich feather. In its earliest form it was stiff\r\nand erect as if cut from a piece of board (Fig. 478), but gradually, as the\r\nrealistic type of heraldic art came into vogue, it was represented more\r\nnaturally and with flowing and drooping curves. Of later years, however, we\r\nhave followed the example of His Majesty when Prince of Wales and reverted\r\nto the earlier form, and it is now very general to give to the ostrich\r\nfeather the stiff and straight appearance which it originally possessed\r\nwhen heraldically depicted. Occasionally a plume of ostrich feathers is\r\nfound enclosed in a \"case,\" that is, wrapped about the lower part as if it\r\nwere a bouquet, and this form is the more usual in Germany. In German\r\nheraldry these plumes are constantly met with in the colours of the arms,\r\nor charged with the whole or a part of the device upon the shield. It is\r\nnot a common practice in this country, but an instance of it will be found\r\nin the arms of Lord Waldegrave: \"Per pale argent and gules. Crest: out of a\r\nducal coronet or a plume of five ostrich feathers, the first two argent,\r\nthe third per pale argent and gules, and the last two gules.\" {253}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nFISH\r\n\r\nHeraldry has a system of \"natural\" history all its very own, and included\r\nin the comprehensive heraldic term of fish are dolphins, whales, and other\r\ncreatures. There are certain terms which apply to heraldic fish which\r\nshould be noted. A fish in a horizontal position is termed \"naiant,\"\r\nwhether it is in or upon water or merely depicted as a charge upon a\r\nshield. A fish is termed \"hauriant\" if it is in a perpendicular position,\r\nbut though it will usually be represented with the head upwards in default\r\nof any specific direction to the contrary, it by no means follows that this\r\nis always the case, and it is more correct to state whether the head is\r\nupwards or downwards, a practice which it is usually found will be\r\nconformed to. When the charges upon a shield are simply blazoned as \"fish,\"\r\nno particular care need be taken to represent any particular variety, but\r\non the other hand it is not in such cases usual to add any distinctive\r\nsigns by which a charge which is merely a fish might become identified as\r\nany particular kind of fish.\r\n\r\nThe heraldic representations of the _Dolphin_ are strangely dissimilar from\r\nthe real creature, and also show amongst themselves a wide variety and\r\nlatitude. It is early found in heraldry, and no doubt its great importance\r\nin that science is derived from its usage by the Dauphins of France.\r\nConcerning its use by these Princes there are all sorts of curious legends\r\ntold, the most usual being that recited by Berry.\r\n\r\nWoodward refers to this legend, but states that \"in 1343 King Philip of\r\nFrance _purchased_ the domains of Humbert III., Dauphin de Viennois,\" and\r\nfurther remarks that the legend in question \"seems to be without solid\r\nfoundation.\" But neither Woodward nor any other writer seems to have\r\npreviously suggested what is doubtless the true explanation, that the title\r\nof Dauphin and the province of Viennois were a separate dignity of a\r\nsovereign character, to which were attached certain territorial and\r\nsovereign arms [\"Or, a dolphin embowed azure, finned and langued gules\"].\r\nThe assumption of these sovereign arms with the sovereignty and territory\r\nto which they belonged, was as much a matter of course as the use of\r\nseparate arms for the Duchy of Lancaster {254} by his present Majesty King\r\nEdward VII., or the use of separate arms for his Duchy of Cornwall by\r\nH.R.H. the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nBerry is wrong in asserting that no other family were permitted to display\r\nthe dolphin in France, because a very similar coat (but with the dolphin\r\nlifeless) to that of the Dauphin was quartered by the family of La Tour du\r\nPin, who claimed descent from the Dauphins d'Auvergne, another ancient\r\nHouse which originally bore the sovereign title of Dauphin. A dolphin was\r\nthe charge upon the arms of the Grauff von Dälffin (Fig. 481).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 479.--Dolphin naiant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 480.--Dolphin hauriant.]\r\n\r\nThe dolphin upon this shield, as also that in the coat of the Dauphin of\r\nFrance, is neither naiant nor hauriant, but is \"embowed,\" that is, with the\r\ntail curved towards the head. But the term \"embowed\" really signifies\r\nnothing further than \"bent\" in some way, and as a dolphin is never\r\nheraldically depicted straight, it is always understood to be and usually\r\nis termed \"embowed,\" though it will generally be \"naiant embowed\" (Fig.\r\n479), or \"hauriant embowed\" (Fig. 480). The dolphin occurs in the arms of\r\nmany British families, _e.g._ in the arms of Ellis, Monypenny,\r\nLoder-Symonds, Symonds-Taylor, Fletcher, and Stuart-French.\r\n\r\nWoodward states that the dolphin is used as a supporter by the Trevelyans,\r\nBurnabys, &c. In this statement he is clearly incorrect, for neither of\r\nthose families are entitled to or use supporters. But his statement\r\nprobably originates in the practice which in accordance with the debased\r\nideas of artistic decoration at one period added all sorts of fantastic\r\nobjects to the edges of a shield for purely decorative (!) purposes. The\r\nonly instance within my knowledge in which a dolphin figures as a heraldic\r\nsupporter will be found in the case of the arms of Waterford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 481.--Arms of the Grauff von Dälffin lett och in\r\nDalffinat (Count von Dälffin), which also lies in Dauphiné (from\r\nGrünenberg's \"Book of Arms\"): Argent, a dolphin azure within a bordure\r\ncompony of the first and second.]\r\n\r\n_The Whale_ is seldom met with in British armory, one of its few\r\nappearances being in the arms of Whalley, viz.: \"Argent, three whales'\r\nheads erased sable.\" {255}\r\n\r\nThe crest of an Irish family named Yeates is said to be: \"A shark issuant\r\nregardant swallowing a man all proper,\" and the same device is also\r\nattributed to some number of other families.\r\n\r\nAnother curious piscine coat of arms is that borne, but still\r\nunmatriculated, by the burgh of Inveraray, namely: \"The field is the sea\r\nproper, a net argent suspended to the base from the dexter chief and the\r\nsinister fess points, and in chief two and in base three herrings entangled\r\nin the net.\"\r\n\r\n_Salmon_ are not infrequently met with, but they need no specific\r\ndescription. They occur in the arms of Peebles,[20] a coat of arms which in\r\nan alternative blazon introduces to one's notice the term \"contra-naiant.\"\r\nThe explanation of the quaint and happy conceit of these arms and motto is\r\nthat for every fish which goes up the river to spawn two return to the sea.\r\nA salmon on its back figures in the arms of the city of Glasgow, and also\r\nin the arms of Lumsden and Finlay, whilst other instances of salmon occur\r\nin the arms of Blackett-Ord, Sprot, and Winlaw.\r\n\r\n_The Herring_ occurs in the arms of Maconochie, the _Roach_ in the arms of\r\nRoche [\"Gules, three roaches naiant within a bordure engrailed argent.\r\nCrest: a rock, thereon a stork close, charged on the breast with a torteau,\r\nand holding in his dexter claw a roach proper\"], and _Trout_ in the arms of\r\nTroutbeck [\"Azure, three trout fretted tête à la queue argent\"]. The same\r\narrangement of three fish occurs upon the seal of Anstruther Wester, but\r\nthis design unfortunately has never been matriculated as a coat of arms.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Iceland present a curious charge, which is included upon the\r\nRoyal shield of Denmark. The coat in question is: \"Gules, a stockfish\r\nargent, crowned with an open crown or.\" The stockfish is a dried and cured\r\ncod, split open and with the head removed.\r\n\r\n_A Pike_ or _Jack_ is more often termed a \"lucy\" in English heraldry and a\r\n\"ged\" in Scottish. Under its various names it occurs in the arms of Lucy,\r\nLucas, Geddes, and Pyke.\r\n\r\n_The Eel_ is sometimes met with, as in the arms of Ellis, and though, as\r\nWoodward states, it is always given a wavy form, the term \"ondoyant,\" which\r\nhe uses to express this, has, I believe, no place in an English armorist's\r\ndictionary.\r\n\r\n_The Lobster_ and _Crab_ are not unknown to English armory, being\r\nrespectively the crests of the families of Dykes and Bridger. The arms of\r\nBridger are: \"Argent, a chevron engrailed sable, between three crabs\r\ngules.\" Lobster claws are a charge upon the arms of Platt-Higgins. {256}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 482.--Whelk shell.]\r\n\r\nThe arms of Birt are given in Papworth as: \"Azure, a birthfish proper,\" and\r\nof Bersich as: \"Argent, a perch azure.\" The arms of Cobbe (Bart., extinct)\r\nare: \"Per chevron gules and sable, in chief two swans respecting and in\r\nbase a herring cob naiant proper.\" The arms of Bishop Robinson of Carlisle\r\nwere: \"Azure, a flying fish in bend argent, on a chief of the second, a\r\nrose gules between two torteaux,\" and the crest of Sir Philip Oakley Fysh\r\nis: \"On a wreath of the colours, issuant from a wreath of red coral, a\r\ncubit arm vested azure, cuffed argent, holding in the hand a flying fish\r\nproper.\" The coat of arms of Colston of Essex is: \"Azure, two barbels\r\nhauriant respecting each other argent,\" and a barbel occurs in the crest of\r\nBinney. \"Vert, three sea-breams or hakes hauriant argent\" is the coat of\r\narms attributed to a family of Dox or Doxey, and \"Or, three chabots gules\"\r\nis that of a French family of the name of Chabot. \"Barry wavy of six argent\r\nand gules, three crevices (crayfish) two and one or\" is the coat of\r\nAtwater. Codfish occur in the arms of Beck, dogfish in the arms of Dodds\r\n(which may, however, be merely the sea-dog of the Dodge achievement),\r\nflounders or flukes in the arms of Arbutt, garvinfishes in the arms of\r\nGarvey, and gudgeon in the arms of Gobion. Papworth also includes instances\r\nof mackerel, prawns, shrimps, soles, sparlings, sturgeon, sea-urchins,\r\nturbots, whales, and whelks. The whelk shell (Fig. 482) appears in the arms\r\nof Storey and Wilkinson. {257}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nREPTILES\r\n\r\nIf armorial zoology is \"shaky\" in its classification of and dealings with\r\nfish, it is most wonderful when its laws and selections are considered\r\nunder the heading of reptiles. But with the exception of serpents (of\r\nvarious kinds), the remainder must have no more than a passing mention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 483.--Serpent nowed.]\r\n\r\nThe usual heraldic _Serpent_ is most frequently found \"nowed,\" that is,\r\ninterlaced in a knot (Fig. 483). There is a certain well-understood form\r\nfor the interlacing which is always officially adhered to, but of late\r\nthere has manifested itself amongst heraldic artists a desire to break\r\nloose to a certain extent from the stereotyped form. A serpent will\r\nsometimes be found \"erect\" and occasionally gliding or \"glissant,\" and\r\nsometimes it will be met with in a circle with its tail in its mouth--the\r\nancient symbol of eternity. Its constant appearance in British armory is\r\ndue to the fact that it is symbolically accepted as the sign of medicine,\r\nand many grants of arms made to doctors and physicians introduce in some\r\nway either the serpent or the rod of Æsculapius, or a serpent entwined\r\nround a staff. A serpent embowed biting its tail occurs in the arms of\r\nFalconer, and a serpent on its back in the crest of Backhouse. Save for the\r\nmatter of position, the serpent of British armory is always drawn in a very\r\nnaturalistic manner. It is otherwise, however, in Continental armory, where\r\nthe serpent takes up a position closely allied to that of our dragon. It is\r\neven sometimes found winged, and the arms of the family of Visconti, which\r\nsubsequently came into use as the arms of the Duchy of Milan (Fig. 484),\r\nhave familiarised us as far as Continental armory is concerned with a form\r\nof serpent which is very different from the real animal or from our own\r\nheraldic variety. Another instance of a serpent will be found in the arms\r\nof the Irish family of Cotter, which are: \"Argent, a chevron gules between\r\nthree serpents proper,\" and the family of Lanigan O'Keefe bear in one {258}\r\nquarter of their shield: \"Vert, three lizards in pale or.\" The family of\r\nCole bear: \"Argent, a chevron gules between three scorpions reversed\r\nsable,\" a coat of arms which is sometimes quoted with the chevron and the\r\nscorpions both gules or both sable. The family of Preed of Shropshire bear:\r\n\"Azure, three horse-leeches;\" and the family of Whitby bear: \"Gules, three\r\nsnakes coiled or; on a chief of the second, as many pheons sable.\" A family\r\nof Sutton bears: \"Or, a newt vert, in chief a lion rampant gules all within\r\na bordure of the last,\" and Papworth mentions a coat of arms for the name\r\nof Ory: \"Azure, a chameleon on a shady ground proper, in chief a sun or.\"\r\nAnother coat mentioned by Papworth is the arms of Bume: \"Gules, a stellion\r\nserpent proper,\" though what the creature may be it is impossible to\r\nimagine. Unfortunately, when one comes to examine so many of these curious\r\ncoats of arms, one finds no evidence that such families existed, or that\r\nthere is no official authority or record of the arms to which reference can\r\nbe made. There can be no doubt that they largely consist of misreadings or\r\nmisinterpretations of both names and charges, and I am sorely afraid this\r\nremark is the true explanation of what otherwise would be most strange and\r\ninteresting curiosities of arms. Sir Walter Scott's little story in\r\n\"Quentin Durward\" of Toison d'Or, who depicted the \"cat looking through the\r\ndairy window\" as the arms of Childebert, and blazoned it \"sable a musion\r\npassant or, oppressed with a trellis gules, cloué of the second,\" gives in\r\nvery truth the real origin of many quaint coats of arms and heraldic terms.\r\nAncient heraldic writers seem to have amused themselves by inventing\r\n\"appropriate\" arms for mythological or historical personages, and I verily\r\nbelieve that when so doing they never intended these arms to stand for more\r\nthan examples of their own wit. Their credulous successors incorporated\r\nthese little witticisms in the rolls of arms they collected, and one can\r\nonly hope that in the distant future the charming drawings of Mr. E. T.\r\nReed which in recent years have appeared in _Punch_ may not be used in like\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThere are but few instances in English armory in which the _Toad_ or _Frog_\r\nis met with. In fact, the only instance which one can recollect is the coat\r\nof arms attributed to a family of Botreaux, who are said to have borne:\r\n\"Argent, three toads erect sable.\" I am confident, however, that this coat\r\nof arms, if it ever existed, and if it could be traced to its earliest\r\nsources, would be found to be really three buckets of water, a canting\r\nallusion to the name. Toads of course are the charges on the mythical arms\r\nof Pharamond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 484.--Arms of the Visconti, Dukes of Milan: Argent, a\r\nserpent azure, devouring a child gules. (A wood-carving from the castle of\r\nPassau at the turn of the fifteenth century.)]\r\n\r\nAmongst the few instances I have come across of a snail in British armory\r\nare the crest of Slack of Derwent Hill (\"in front of a crescent or, a snail\r\nproper\") and the coat attributed by Papworth to the family of {259} Bartan\r\nor Bertane, who are mentioned as bearing, \"Gules, three snails argent in\r\ntheir shells or.\" This coat, however, is not matriculated in Scotland, so\r\nthat one cannot be certain that it was ever borne. The snail occurs,\r\nhowever, as the crest of a family named Billers, and is also attributed to\r\nseveral other families as a crest.\r\n\r\n_Lizards_ appear occasionally in heraldry, though more frequently in Irish\r\nthan English or Scottish coats of arms. A lizard forms part of the crest of\r\nSillifant, and a hand grasping a lizard is the crest of McCarthy, and\r\n\"Azure, three lizards or\" the first quarter of the arms of an Irish family\r\nof the name of Cotter, who, however, blazon these charges upon their shield\r\nas evetts. The family of Enys, who bear: \"Argent, three wyverns volant in\r\npale vert,\" probably derive their arms from some such source. {260}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nINSECTS\r\n\r\nThe insect which is most usually met with in heraldry is undoubtedly the\r\n_Bee_. Being considered, as it is, the symbol of industry, small wonder\r\nthat it has been so frequently adopted. It is usually represented as if\r\ndisplayed upon the shield, and it is then termed volant, though of course\r\nthe real term which will sometimes be found used is \"volant _en arrière_\"\r\n(Fig. 485). It occurs in the arms of Dore, Beatson, Abercromby, Samuel, and\r\nSewell, either as a charge or as a crest. Its use, however, as a crest is\r\nslightly more varied, inasmuch as it is found walking in profile, and with\r\nits wings elevated, and also perched upon a thistle as in the arms of\r\nFerguson. A bee-hive \"with bees diversely volant\" occurs in the arms of\r\nRowe, and the popularity of the bee in British armory is doubtless due to\r\nthe frequent desire to perpetuate the fact that the foundation of a house\r\nhas been laid by business industry. The fact that the bee was adopted as a\r\nbadge by the Emperor Napoleon gave it considerable importance in French\r\narmory, inasmuch as he assumed it for his own badge, and the mantle and\r\npavilion around the armorial bearings of the Empire were semé of these\r\ninsects. They also appeared upon his own coronation mantle. He adopted them\r\nunder the impression, which may or may not be correct, that they had at one\r\ntime been the badge of Childeric, father of Clovis. The whole story\r\nconnected with their assumption by Napoleon has been a matter of much\r\ncontroversy, and little purpose would be served by going into the matter\r\nhere, but it may be added that Napoleon changed the fleur-de-lis upon the\r\nchief in the arms of Paris to golden bees upon a chief of gules, and a\r\nchief azure, semé of bees or, was added as indicative of their rank to the\r\narms of \"Princes-Grand-Dignitaries of the Empire.\" A bee-hive occurs as the\r\ncrest of a family named Gwatkin, and also upon the arms of the family of\r\nKettle of Wolverhampton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 485.--Bee volant.]\r\n\r\n{261}\r\n\r\n_The Grasshopper_ is most familiar as the crest of the family of Gresham,\r\nand this is the origin of the golden grasshoppers which are so constantly\r\nmet with in the city of London. \"Argent, a chevron sable between three\r\ngrasshoppers vert\" is the coat of arms of Woodward of Kent. Two of them\r\nfigure in the arms of Treacher, which arms are now quartered by Bowles.\r\n\r\n_Ants_ are but seldom met with. \"Argent, six ants, three, two, and one\r\nsable,\" is a coat given by Papworth to a family of the name of Tregent;\r\n\"Vert, an ant argent,\" to Kendiffe; and \"Argent, a chevron vert between\r\nthree beetles proper\" are the arms attributed by the same authority to a\r\nfamily named Muschamp. There can be little doubt, however, that these\r\n\"beetles\" should be described as flies.\r\n\r\n_Butterflies_ figure in the arms of Papillon [\"Azure, a chevron between\r\nthree butterflies volant argent\"] and in the arms of Penhellicke [\"Sable,\r\nthree butterflies volant argent\"].\r\n\r\n_Gadflies_ are to be found in a coat of arms for the name of Adams [\"Per\r\npale argent and gules, a chevron between three gadflies counterchanged\"],\r\nand also in the arms of Somerscales, quartered by Skeet of Bishop\r\nStortford. \"Sable, a hornet argent\" is one blazon for the arms of Bollord\r\nor Bolloure, but elsewhere the same coat is blazoned: \"Sable, a harvest-fly\r\nin pale volant en arrière argent.\" Harvest flies were the charges on the\r\narms of the late Sir Edward Watkin, Bart.\r\n\r\n_Crickets_ appear in the arms [\"azure, a fire chest argent, flames proper,\r\nbetween three crickets or\"] recently granted to Sir George Anderson\r\nCritchett, Bart.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Bassano (really of foreign origin and not an English coat) are:\r\n\"Per chevron vert and argent, in chief three silkworm flies palewise _en\r\narrière_, and in base a mulberry branch all counterchanged.\" \"Per pale\r\ngules and azure, three stag-beetles, wings extended or,\" is assigned by\r\nPapworth to the Cornish family of Dore, but elsewhere these charges (under\r\nthe same family name) are quoted as bees, gadflies, and flies. \"Or, three\r\nspiders azure\" is quoted as a coat for Chettle. A spider also figures as a\r\ncharge on the arms of Macara. The crest of Thorndyke of Great Carleton,\r\nLincolnshire, is: \"On a wreath of the colours a damask rose proper, leaves\r\nand thorns vert, at the bottom of the shield a beetle or scarabæus proper.\"\r\n\r\nWoodward, in concluding his chapter upon insects, quotes the arms of the\r\nfamily of Pullici of Verona, viz.: \"Or, semé of fleas sable, two bends\r\ngules, surmounted by two bends sinister of the same.\" {262}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTREES, LEAVES, FRUITS, AND FLOWERS\r\n\r\nThe vegetable kingdom plays an important part in heraldry. Trees will be\r\nfound of all varieties and in all numbers, and though little difference is\r\nmade in the appearance of many varieties when they are heraldically\r\ndepicted, for canting purposes the various names are carefully preserved.\r\nWhen, however, no name is specified, they are generally drawn after the\r\nfashion of oak-trees.\r\n\r\nWhen a tree issues from the ground it will usually be blazoned \"issuant\r\nfrom a mount vert,\" but when the roots are shown it is termed \"eradicated.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 486.--An oak-tree eradicated.]\r\n\r\n_A Hurst of Trees_ figures both on the shield and in the crest of\r\nFrance-Hayhurst, and in the arms of Lord Lismore [\"Argent, in base a mount\r\nvert, on the dexter side a hurst of oak-trees, therefrom issuing a wolf\r\npassant towards the sinister, all proper\"]. A hurst of elm-trees very\r\nproperly is the crest of the family of Elmhurst. Under the description of a\r\nforest, a number of trees figure in the arms of Forrest.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Walkinshaw of that Ilk are: \"Argent, a grove of fir-trees\r\nproper,\" and Walkinshaw of Barrowfield and Walkinshaw of London have\r\nmatriculated more or less similar arms.\r\n\r\n_The Oak-Tree_ (Fig. 486) is of course the tree most frequently met with.\r\nPerhaps the most famous coat in which it occurs will be found in the arms\r\ngranted to Colonel Carlos, to commemorate his risky sojourn with King\r\nCharles in the oak-tree at Boscobel, after the King's flight subsequent to\r\nthe ill-fated battle of Worcester. The coat was: \"Or, on a mount in base\r\nvert, an oak-tree proper, fructed or, surmounted by a fess gules, charged\r\nwith three imperial crowns of the third\" (Plate II.).\r\n\r\n_Fir-Trees_ will be found in the arms of Greg, Melles, De la Ferté, and\r\nFarquharson.\r\n\r\n_A Cedar-Tree_ occurs in the arms of Montefiore [\"Argent, a cedar-tree,\r\nbetween two mounts of flowers proper, on a chief azure, a dagger {263}\r\nerect proper, pommel and hilt or, between two mullets of six points gold\"],\r\nand a _hawthorn-tree_ in the arms of MacMurrogh-Murphy, Thornton, and in\r\nthe crest of Kynnersley.\r\n\r\n_A Maple-Tree_ figures in the arms of Lord Mount-Stephen [\"Or, on a mount\r\nvert, a maple-tree proper, in chief two fleurs-de-lis azure\"], and in the\r\ncrest of Lord Strathcona [\"On a mount vert, a maple-tree, at the base\r\nthereof a beaver gnawing the trunk all proper\"].\r\n\r\n_A Cocoanut-Tree_ is the principal charge in the arms of Glasgow (now\r\nRobertson-Glasgow) of Montgrennan, matriculated in 1807 [\"Argent, a\r\ncocoanut-tree fructed proper, growing out of a mount in base vert, on a\r\nchief azure, a shakefork between a martlet on the dexter and a salmon on\r\nthe sinister argent, the last holding in the mouth a ring or\"].\r\n\r\nThe arms of Clifford afford an instance of a _Coffee-Tree_, and the coat of\r\nChambers has a negro cutting down a _Sugar-Cane_.\r\n\r\n_A Palm-Tree_ occurs in the arms of Besant and in the armorials of many\r\nother families. The crest of Grimké-Drayton affords an instance of the use\r\nof palmetto-trees. An _Olive-Tree_ is the crest of Tancred, and a\r\n_Laurel-Tree_ occurs in the crest of Somers.\r\n\r\n_Cypress-Trees_ are quoted by Papworth in the arms of Birkin, probably an\r\nerror for birch-trees, but the cypress does occur in the arms of Tardy,\r\nComte de Montravel [\"Argent, three cypress-trees eradicated vert, on a\r\nchief gules, as many bezants\"], and \"Or, a willow (salix) proper\" is the\r\ncoat of the Counts de Salis (now Fane-de-Salis).\r\n\r\nThe arms of Sweetland, granted in 1808, are: \"Argent, on a mount vert, an\r\norange-tree fructed proper, on a chief embattled gules, three roses of the\r\nfield, barbed and seeded also proper.\"\r\n\r\n_A Mountain-Ash_ figures in the shield and crest of Wigan, and a\r\n_Walnut-Tree_ is the crest of Waller, of Groombridge [\"On a mount vert, a\r\nwalnut-tree proper, on the sinister side an escutcheon pendent, charged\r\nwith the arms of France, and thereupon a label of three points argent.\"]\r\n\r\nThe arms of Arkwright afford an example of a _Cotton-Tree_.\r\n\r\nThe curious crest of Sir John Leman, Lord Mayor of London, affords an\r\ninstance of a _Lemon-Tree_ [\"In a lemon-tree proper, a pelican in her piety\r\nproper\"].\r\n\r\nThe arms of a family whose name appears to have been variously spelled\r\nEstwere, Estwrey, Estewer, Estower, and Esture, have: \"Upon an argent field\r\na tree proper,\" variously described as an apple-tree, an ash-tree, and a\r\ncherry-tree. The probabilities largely point to its being an ash-tree. \"Or,\r\non a mount in base vert, a pear-tree fructed proper\" is the coat of arms of\r\nPyrton or Peryton, and the arms granted in 1591 to Dr. Lopus, a physician\r\nto Queen Elizabeth, were: \"Or, a {264} pomegranate-tree eradicated vert,\r\nfructed gold, supported by a hart rampant proper, crowned and attired of\r\nthe first.\"\r\n\r\n_A Poplar Tree_ occurs in the arms of Gandolfi, but probably the prime\r\ncuriosity must be the coat of Abank, which Papworth gives as: \"Argent, a\r\nChina-cokar tree vert.\" Its botanical identity remains a mystery.\r\n\r\n_Trunks of Trees_ for some curious reason play a prominent part in\r\nheraldry. The arms of Borough, of Chetwynd Park, granted in 1702, are:\r\n\"Argent, on a mount in base, in base the trunk of an oak-tree sprouting out\r\ntwo branches proper, with the shield of Pallas hanging thereon or, fastened\r\nby a belt gules,\" and the arms of Houldsworth (1868) of Gonaldston, co.\r\nNotts, are: \"Ermine, the trunk of a tree in bend raguly eradicated at the\r\nbase proper, between three foxes' heads, two in chief and one in base\r\nerased gules.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is as a crest that this figure of the withered trunk sprouting again\r\nis most often met with, it being assigned to no less than forty-three\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nIn England again, by one of those curious fads by which certain objects\r\nwere repeated over and over again in the wretched designs granted by the\r\nlate Sir Albert Woods, Garter, in spite of their unsuitability, tree-trunks\r\nfesswise eradicated and sprouting are constantly met with either as the\r\nbasis of the crest or placed \"in front of it\" to help in providing the\r\ndifferences and distinctions which he insisted upon in a new grant. An\r\nexample of such use of it will be found in the arms of the town of\r\nAbergavenny.\r\n\r\n_Stocks of Trees_ \"couped and eradicated\" are by no means uncommon. They\r\nfigure in the arms of the Borough of Woodstock: \"Gules, the stump of a tree\r\ncouped and eradicated argent, and in chief three stags' heads caboshed of\r\nthe same, all within a bordure of the last charged with eight oak-leaves\r\nvert.\" They also occur in the arms of Grove, of Shenston Park, co.\r\nStafford, and in the arms of Stubbs.\r\n\r\nThe arms matriculated in Lyon Register by Capt. Peter Winchester (_c._\r\n1672-7) are: \"Argent, a vine growing out of the base, leaved and fructed,\r\nbetween two papingoes endorsed feeding upon the clusters all proper.\" The\r\nvine also appears in the arms of Ruspoli, and the family of Archer-Houblon\r\nbear for the latter name: \"Argent, on a mount in base, three hop-poles\r\nerect with hop-vines all proper.\"\r\n\r\nThe town of St. Ives (Cornwall) has no authorised arms, but those usually\r\nattributed to the town are: \"Argent, an ivy branch overspreading the whole\r\nfield vert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gules, a flaming bush on the top of a mount proper, between three lions\r\nrampant argent, in the flanks two roses of the last\" is the coat of Brander\r\n(now Dunbar-Brander) of Pitgavenny. Holly-bushes {265} are also met with,\r\nas in the crests of Daubeney and Crackanthorpe, and a rose-bush as in the\r\ncrest of Inverarity.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Owen, co. Pembroke, are: \"Gules, a boar argent, armed,\r\nbristled, collared, and chained or to a holly-bush on a mount in base both\r\nproper.\"\r\n\r\n_A Fern-Brake_ is another stock object used in designing modern crests, and\r\nwill be found in the cases of Harter, Scott-Gatty, and Lloyd.\r\n\r\nBranches are constantly occurring, but they are usually oak, laurel, palm,\r\nor holly. They need to be distinguished from \"slips,\" which are much\r\nsmaller and with fewer leaves. Definite rules of distinction between e.g.\r\nan acorn \"slipped,\" a slip of oak, and an oak-branch have been laid down by\r\npurists, but no such minute detail is officially observed, and it seems\r\nbetter to leave the point to general artistic discretion; the colloquial\r\ndifference between a slip and a branch being quite a sufficient guide upon\r\nthe point.\r\n\r\nAn example of an _Oak-Branch_ occurs in the arms of Aikman, and another,\r\nwhich is rather curious, is the crest of Accrington.[21]\r\n\r\n_Oak-Slips_, on the other hand, occur in the arms of Baldwin.\r\n\r\n_A Palm-Branch_ occurs in the crests of Innes, Chafy, and Corfield.\r\n\r\n_Laurel-Branches_ occur in the arms of Cooper, and sprigs of laurel in the\r\narms of Meeking.\r\n\r\n_Holly-Branches_ are chiefly found in the arms of families named Irvine or\r\nIrwin, but they are invariably blazoned as \"sheaves\" of holly or as\r\nholly-branches of three leaves. To a certain extent this is a misnomer,\r\nbecause the so-called \"branch\" is merely three holly-leaves tied together.\r\n\r\n\"Argent, an almond-slip proper\" is the coat of arms attributed to a family\r\nof Almond, and Papworth assigns \"Argent, a barberry-branch fructed proper\"\r\nto Berry.\r\n\r\n\"Argent, three sprigs of balm flowered proper\" is stated to be the coat of\r\na family named Balme, and \"Argent, three teasels slipped proper\" the coat\r\nof Bowden, whilst Boden of the Friary bears, \"Argent, a chevron sable\r\nbetween three teasels proper, a bordure of the second.\" A teasle on a\r\ncanton figures in the arms of Chichester-Constable.\r\n\r\nThe Company of Tobacco-Pipe Makers in London, incorporated in the year\r\n1663, bore: \"Argent, on a mount in base vert, three plants of tobacco\r\ngrowing and flowering all proper.\" The crest recently granted to Sir Thomas\r\nLipton, Bart. [\"On a wreath of the colours, two arms in saltire, the dexter\r\nsurmounted by the sinister {266} holding a sprig of the tea-plant erect,\r\nand the other a like sprig of the coffee-plant both slipped and leaved\r\nproper, vested above the elbow argent\"], affords an example of both the\r\ncoffee-plant and the tea-plant, which have both assisted him so materially\r\nin piling up his immense fortune. \"Or, three birch-twigs sable\" is the coat\r\nof Birches, and \"Or, a bunch of nettles vert\" is the coat of Mallerby of\r\nDevonshire. The pun in the last case is apparent.\r\n\r\n_The Cotton-Plant_ figures in the arms of the towns of Darwen, Rochdale,\r\nand Nelson, and two culms of the papyrus plant occur in the arms of the\r\ntown of Bury.\r\n\r\n_The Coffee-Plant_ also figures in the arms of Yockney: \"Azure, a chevron\r\nor, between a ship under sail in chief proper, and a sprig of the\r\ncoffee-plant slipped in base of the second.\"\r\n\r\nA branch, slip, bush, or tree is termed \"fructed\" when the fruit is shown,\r\nthough the term is usually disregarded unless \"fructed\" of a different\r\ncolour. When represented as \"fructed,\" the fruit is usually drawn out of\r\nall proportion to its relative size.\r\n\r\nLeaves are not infrequent in their appearance. Holly-leaves occur in the\r\nvarious coats for most people of the name of Irwin and Irvine, as already\r\nmentioned. Laurel-leaves occur in the arms of Leveson-Gower, Foulis, and\r\nFoulds.\r\n\r\n_Oak-Leaves_ occur in the arms of Trelawney [\"Argent, a chevron sable,\r\nbetween three oak-leaves slipped proper\"]; and _hazel-leaves_ in the arms\r\nof Hesilrige or Hazlerigg [\"Argent, a chevron sable, between three\r\nhazel-leaves vert].\r\n\r\n\"Argent, three edock (dock or burdock) leaves vert\" is the coat of Hepburn.\r\nPapworth assigns \"Argent, an aspen leaf proper\" to Aspinal, and \"Or, a\r\nbetony-leaf proper\" to Betty. \"Argent, three aspen-leaves\" is an\r\nunauthorised coat used by Espin, and the same coat with varying tinctures\r\nis assigned to Cogan. Killach is stated to bear: \"Azure, three bay-leaves\r\nargent,\" and to Woodward, of Little Walsingham, Norfolk, was granted in\r\n1806: \"Vert, three mulberry-leaves or.\"\r\n\r\n_The Maple-Leaf_ has been generally adopted as a Canadian emblem, and\r\nconsequently figures upon the arms of that Dominion, and in the arms of\r\nmany families which have or have had Canadian associations.\r\n\r\n\"Vert, three vine-leaves or\" is assigned by Papworth to Wortford, and the\r\nsame authority mentions coats in which woodbine-leaves occur for Browne,\r\nTheme, and Gamboa. Rose-leaves occur in the arms of Utermarck, and\r\nwalnut-leaves figure in the arms of Waller.\r\n\r\nA curious leaf--usually called the \"sea-leaf,\" which is properly the\r\n\"nenuphar-leaf,\" is often met with in German heraldry, as are _Linden_\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nAlthough theoretically leaves, the trefoil, quatrefoil, and cinquefoil\r\n{267} are a class by themselves, having a recognised heraldic status as\r\nexclusively heraldic charges, and the quatrefoil and cinquefoil, in spite\r\nof the derivation of their names, are as likely to have been originally\r\nflowers as leaves.\r\n\r\n_The heraldic Trefoil_ (Fig. 487), though frequently specifically described\r\nas \"slipped,\" is nevertheless always so depicted, and it is not necessary\r\nto so describe it. Of late a tendency has been noticeable in paintings from\r\nUlster's Office to represent the trefoil in a way more nearly approaching\r\nthe Irish shamrock, from which it has undoubtedly been derived. Instances\r\nof the trefoil occur in the arms of Rodd, Dobrée, MacDermott, and Gilmour.\r\nThe crowned trefoil is one of the national badges of Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 487.--Trefoil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 488.--Quatrefoil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 489.--Cinquefoil.]\r\n\r\nA four-leaved \"lucky\" shamrock has been introduced into the arms of Sir\r\nRobert Hart, Bart.\r\n\r\n_The Quatrefoil_ (Fig. 488) is not often met with, but it occurs in the\r\narms of Eyre, King, and Dreyer.\r\n\r\n_The Cinquefoil_ (Fig. 489) is of frequent appearance, but, save in\r\nexceedingly rare instances, neither the quatrefoil nor the cinquefoil will\r\nbe met with \"slipped.\" The constant occurrence of the cinquefoil in early\r\nrolls of arms is out of all proportion to its distinctiveness or artistic\r\nbeauty, and the frequency with which it is met with in conjunction with the\r\ncross crosslet points clearly to the fact that there is some allusion\r\nbehind, if this could only be fathomed. Many a man might adopt a lion\r\nthrough independent choice, but one would not expect independent choice to\r\nlead so many to pitch upon a combination of cross crosslets and\r\ncinquefoils. The cross crosslets, I am confident, are a later addition in\r\nmany cases, for the original arms of D'Arcy, for example, were simply:\r\n\"Argent, three cinquefoils gules.\" The arms of the town of Leicester are:\r\n\"Gules, a cinquefoil ermine,\" and this is the coat attributed to the family\r\nof the De Beaumonts or De Bellomonts, Earls of Leicester. Simon de\r\nMontfort, the great Earl of Leicester, was the son or grandson of Amicia, a\r\ncoheir of the former Earls, and as such {268} entitled to quarter the arms\r\nof the De Bellomonts. As stated on page 117 (_vide_ Figs. 97 and 98), there\r\nare two coats attributed to De Montfort. His only status in this country\r\ndepended solely upon the De Bellomont inheritance, and, conformably with\r\nthe custom of the period, we are far more likely to find him using arms of\r\nDe Bellomont or De Beaumont than of Montfort. From the similarity of the\r\ncharge to the better-known Beaumont arms, I am inclined to think the lion\r\nrampant to be the real De Bellomont coat. The origin of the cinquefoil has\r\nyet to be accounted for. The earliest De Bellomont for whom I can find\r\nproof of user thereof is Robert \"Fitz-Pernell,\" otherwise De Bellomont, who\r\ndied in 1206, and whose seal (Fig. 490) shows it. Be it noted it is not on\r\na shield, and though of course this is not proof in any way, it is in\r\naccord with my suggestion that it is nothing more than a pimpernel flower\r\nadopted as a device or badge to typify his own name and his mother's name,\r\nshe being Pernelle or Petronilla, the heiress of Grantmesnil. The\r\ncinquefoil was not the coat of Grantmesnil but a quaint little conceit, and\r\nis not therefore likely to have been used as a coat of arms by the De\r\nBellomonts, though no doubt they used it as a badge and device, as no doubt\r\ndid Simon de Montfort. Simon de Montfort split England into two parties.\r\nMen were for Montfort or the king, and those that were for De Montfort very\r\nprobably took and used his badge of a cinquefoil as a party badge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 490.--From the seal of Robert Fitz-Pernell, Earl of\r\nLeicester, d. 1206.]\r\n\r\nThe cinquefoil in its ordinary heraldic form also occurs in the arms of\r\nUmfraville, Bardolph, Hamilton, and D'Arcy, and sprigs of cinquefoil will\r\nbe found in the arms of Hill, and in the crest of Kersey. The cinquefoil is\r\nsometimes found pierced. The five-foiled flower being the blossom of so\r\nmany plants, what are to all intents and purposes cinquefoils occur in the\r\narms of Fraser, where they are termed \"fraises,\" of Primrose, where they\r\nare blazoned \"primroses,\" and of Lambert, where they are called \"narcissus\r\nflowers.\"\r\n\r\n_The double Quatrefoil_ is cited as the English difference mark for the\r\nninth son, but as these difference marks are but seldom used, and as ninth\r\nsons are somewhat of a rarity, it is seldom indeed that this particular\r\nmark is seen in use. Personally I have never seen it.\r\n\r\n_The Turnip_ makes an early appearance in armory, and occurs in the coat of\r\nDammant [\"Sable, a turnip leaved proper, a chief or, gutté-de-poix\"]. {269}\r\n\r\nThe curious crest of Lingen, which is \"Seven leeks root upwards issuing\r\nfrom a ducal coronet all proper,\" is worthy of especial mention.\r\n\r\nIn considering flowers as a charge, a start must naturally be made with the\r\nrose, which figures so prominently in the heraldry of England.\r\n\r\n_The heraldic Rose_ until a much later date than its first appearance in\r\narmory--it occurs, however, at the earliest period--was always represented\r\nin what we now term the \"conventional\" form, with five displayed petals\r\n(Fig. 491). Accustomed as we are to the more ornate form of the cultivated\r\nrose of the garden, those who speak of the \"conventional\" heraldic rose\r\nrather seem to overlook that it is an exact reproduction of the wild rose\r\nof the hedgerow, which, morever, has a tendency to show itself \"displayed\"\r\nand not in the more profile attitude we are perhaps accustomed to. It\r\nshould also be observed that the earliest representations of the heraldic\r\nrose depict the intervening spaces between the petals which are noticeable\r\nin the wild rose. Under the Tudor sovereigns, the heraldic rose often shows\r\na double row of petals, a fact which is doubtless accounted for by the then\r\nincreasing familiarity with the cultivated variety, and also by the attempt\r\nto conjoin the rival emblems of the warring factions of York and Lancaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 491.--Rose.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 492.--Rose slipped and leaved.]\r\n\r\nThough the heraldic rose is seldom, if ever, otherwise depicted, it should\r\nbe described as \"barbed vert\" and \"seeded or\" (or \"barbed and seeded\r\nproper\") when the centre seeds and the small intervening green leaves (the\r\ncalyx) between the petals are represented in their natural colours. In the\r\nreign of the later Tudor sovereigns the conventionality of earlier heraldic\r\nart was slowly beginning to give way to the pure naturalism towards which\r\nheraldic art thereafter steadily degenerated, and we find that the rose\r\nthen begins (both as a Royal badge and elsewhere) to be met with \"slipped\r\nand leaved\" (Fig. 492). The Royal fleurs-de-lis are turned into natural\r\nlilies in the grant of arms to Eton College, and in the grant to William\r\nCope, Cofferer to Henry VII., the roses are slipped [\"Argent, on a chevron\r\nazure, between three roses gules, slipped and leaved vert, as many\r\nfleurs-de-lis or. Crest: out of a fleur-de-lis or, a dragon's head gules\"].\r\nA rose when \"slipped\" theoretically has only a stalk added, but in practice\r\nit will always have at least one leaf added to the slip, and a rose\r\n\"slipped and leaved\" would {270} have a leaf on either side. A rose\r\n\"stalked and leaved\" is not so limited, and will usually be found with a\r\nslightly longer stalk and several leaves; but these technical refinements\r\nof blazon, which are really unnecessary, are not greatly observed or taken\r\ninto account. The arms of the Burgh of Montrose afford an example of a\r\nsingle rose as the only charge, although other instances will be met with\r\nin the arms of Boscawen, Viscount Falmouth [\"Ermine, a rose gules, barbed\r\nand seeded proper\"], and of Nightingale, Bart. [\"Per pale ermine and gules,\r\na rose counterchanged\"].\r\n\r\nAmongst the scores of English arms in which the rose figures, it will be\r\nfound in the original heraldic form in the case of the arms of Southampton\r\n(Plate VII.); and either stalked or slipped in the arms of Brodribb and\r\nWhite-Thomson. A curious instance of the use of the rose will be found in\r\nthe crest of Bewley, and the \"cultivated\" rose was depicted in the\r\nemblazonment of the crest of Inverarity, which is a rose-bush proper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 493.--Thistle.]\r\n\r\nHeraldry, with its roses, has accomplished what horticulture has not. There\r\nis an old legend that when Henry VII. succeeded to the English throne some\r\nenterprising individual produced a natural parti-coloured rose which\r\nanswered to the conjoined heraldic rose of gules and argent. Our roses \"or\"\r\nmay really find their natural counterpart in the primrose, but the arms of\r\nRochefort [\"Quarterly or and azure, four roses counterchanged\"] give us the\r\n_blue_ rose, the arms of Berendon [\"Argent, three roses sable\"] give us the\r\n_black_ rose, and the coat of Smallshaw [\"Argent, a rose vert, between\r\nthree shakeforks sable\"] is the long-desired _green_ rose.\r\n\r\n_The Thistle_ (Fig. 493) ranks next to the rose in British heraldic\r\nimportance. Like the rose, the reason of its assumption as a national badge\r\nremains largely a matter of mystery, though it is of nothing like so\r\nancient an origin. Of course one knows the time-honoured and wholly\r\nimpossible legend that its adoption as a national symbol dates from the\r\nbattle of Largs, when one of the Danish invaders gave away an attempted\r\nsurprise by his cry of agony caused by stepping barefooted upon a thistle.\r\n\r\nThe fact, however, remains that its earliest appearance is on the silver\r\ncoinage of 1474, in the reign of James III., but during that reign there\r\ncan be no doubt that it was accepted either as a national badge or else as\r\nthe personal badge of the sovereign. The period in question was that in\r\nwhich badges were so largely used, and it is not unlikely that, desiring to\r\nvie with his brother of England, and fired by the {271} example of the\r\nbroom badge and the rose badge, the Scottish king, remembering the ancient\r\nlegend, chose the thistle as his own badge. In 1540, when the thistle had\r\nbecome recognised as one of the national emblems of the kingdom, the\r\nfoundation of the Order of the Thistle stereotyped the fact for all future\r\ntime. The conventional heraldic representation of the thistle is as it\r\nappears upon the star of that Order, that is, the flowered head upon a\r\nshort stalk with a leaf on either side. Though sometimes represented of\r\ngold, it is nearly always proper. It has frequently been granted as an\r\naugmentation, though in such a meaning it will usually be found crowned.\r\nThe coat of augmentation carried in the first quarter of his arms by Lord\r\nTorphichen is: \"Argent, a thistle vert, flowered gules (really a thistle\r\nproper), on a chief azure an imperial crown or.\" \"Sable, a thistle\r\n(possibly really a teasel) or, between three pheons argent\" is the coat of\r\nTeesdale, and \"Gules, three thistles or\" is attributed in Papworth to\r\nHawkey. A curious use of the thistle occurs in the arms of the National\r\nBank of Scotland (granted 1826), which are: \"Or, the image of St. Andrew\r\nwith vesture vert, and surcoat purpure, bearing before him the cross of his\r\nmartyrdom argent, all resting on a base of the second, in the dexter flank\r\na garb gules, in the sinister a ship in full sail sable, _the shield\r\nsurrounded with two thistles proper disposed in orle_.\"\r\n\r\n_The Lily_ in its natural form sometimes occurs, though of course it\r\ngenerally figures as the fleur-de-lis, which will presently be considered.\r\nThe natural lily will be found in the arms of Aberdeen University, of\r\nDundee, and in the crests of various families of the name of Chadwick. It\r\nalso occurs in the arms of the College of St. Mary the Virgin, at Eton\r\n[\"Sable, three lilies argent, on a chief per pale azure and gules a\r\nfleur-de-lis on the dexter side, and a lion passant guardant or on the\r\nsinister\"]. Here they doubtless typify the Virgin, to whom they have\r\nreference; as also in the case of Marylebone (Fig. 252).\r\n\r\nThe arms of Lilly, of Stoke Prior, are: \"Gules, three lilies slipped\r\nargent;\" and the arms of J. E. Lilley, Esq., of Harrow, are: \"Azure, on a\r\npile between two fleurs-de-lis argent, a lily of the valley eradicated\r\nproper. Crest: on a wreath of the colours, a cubit arm erect proper,\r\ncharged with a fleur-de-lis argent and holding in the hand two lilies of\r\nthe valley, leaved and slipped in saltire, also proper.\"\r\n\r\n_Columbine Flowers_ occur in the arms of Cadman, and _Gillyflowers_ in the\r\narms of Livingstone. _Fraises_--really the flowers of the\r\nstrawberry-plant--occur, as has been already mentioned, in the arms of\r\nFraser, and _Narcissus Flowers_ in the arms of Lambeth. \"Gules, three poppy\r\nbolles on their stalks in fess or\" are the arms of Boller.\r\n\r\n_The Lotus-Flower_, which is now very generally becoming the recognised\r\nemblem of India, is constantly met with in the arms granted to {272} those\r\nwho have won fortune or reputation in that country. Instances in which it\r\noccurs are the arms of Sir Roper Lethbridge, K.C.I.E., Sir Thomas Seccombe,\r\nG.C.I.E., and the University of Madras.\r\n\r\nThe _Sylphium-Plant_ occurs in the arms of General Sir Henry Augustus\r\nSmyth, K.C.M.G., which are: Vert, a chevron erminois, charged with a\r\nchevron gules, between three Saracens' heads habited in profile couped at\r\nthe neck proper, and for augmentation a chief argent, thereon a mount vert\r\ninscribed with the Greek letters K Y P A gold and issuant therefrom a\r\nrepresentation of the plant Silphium proper. Crests: 1. (of augmentation)\r\non a wreath of the colours, a mount vert inscribed with the aforesaid Greek\r\nletters and issuant therefrom the Silphium as in the arms; 2. on a wreath\r\nof the colours, an anchor fesswise sable, thereon an ostrich erminois\r\nholding in the beak a horse-shoe or. Motto: \"Vincere est vivere.\"\r\n\r\nThe arms granted to Sir Richard Quain were: \"Argent, a chevron engrailed\r\nazure, in chief two fers-de-moline gules, and issuant from the base a rock\r\ncovered with daisies proper.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 494.--Fleur-de-lis.]\r\n\r\n_Primroses_ occur (as was only to be expected) in the arms of the Earl of\r\nRosebery [\"Vert, three primroses within a double tressure flory\r\ncounterflory or\"].\r\n\r\n_The Sunflower_ or _Marigold_ occurs in the crest of Buchan [\"A sunflower\r\nin full bloom towards the sun in the dexter chief\"], and also in the arms\r\ngranted in 1614 to Florio. Here, however, the flower is termed a\r\nheliotrope. The arms in question are: \"Azure, a heliotrope or, issuing from\r\na stalk sprouting from two leaves vert, in chief the sun in splendour\r\nproper.\"\r\n\r\n_Tulips_ occur in the arms of Raphael, and the _Cornflower_ or _Bluebottle_\r\nin the arms of Chorley of Chorley, Lancs. [\"Argent, a chevron gules between\r\nthree bluebottles slipped proper\"], and also in the more modern arms of\r\nthat town.\r\n\r\n_Saffron-Flowers_ are a charge upon the arms of Player of Nottingham. The\r\narms granted to Sir Edgar Boehm, Bart., were: \"Azure, in the sinister\r\ncanton a sun issuant therefrom eleven rays, over all a clover-plant\r\neradicated proper.\"\r\n\r\n_The Fleur-de-Lis._--Few figures have puzzled the antiquary so much as the\r\nfleur-de-lis. Countless origins have been suggested for it; we have even\r\nlately had the height of absurdity urged in a suggested phallic origin,\r\nwhich only rivals in ridiculousness the long since exploded legend that the\r\nfleurs-de-lis in the arms of France were a {273} corrupted form of an\r\nearlier coat, \"Azure, three toads or,\" the reputed coat of arms of\r\nPharamond!\r\n\r\nTo France and the arms of France one must turn for the origin of the\r\nheraldic use of the fleur-de-lis. To begin with, the form of the\r\nfleur-de-lis as a mere presumably meaningless form of decoration is found\r\nlong before the days of armory, in fact from the earliest period of\r\ndecoration. It is such an essentially natural development of decoration\r\nthat it may be accepted as such without any attempt to give it a meaning or\r\nany symbolism. Its earliest heraldic appearances as the finial of a sceptre\r\nor the decoration of a coronet need not have had any symbolical character.\r\n\r\nWe then find the \"lily\" accepted as having some symbolical reference to\r\nFrance, and it should be remembered that the iris was known by the name of\r\na lily until comparatively modern times.\r\n\r\nIt is curious--though possibly in this case it may be only a\r\ncoincidence--that, on a coin of the Emperor Hadrian, Gaul is typified by a\r\nfemale figure holding in the hand a lily, the legend being, \"Restutori\r\nGalliæ.\" The fleur-de-lis as the finial of a sceptre and as an ornament of\r\na crown can be taken back to the fifth century. Fleurs-de-lis upon crowns\r\nand coronets in France are at least as old as the reign of King Robert (son\r\nof Hugh Capet) whose seal represents him crowned in this manner.\r\n\r\nWe have, moreover, the ancient legendary tradition that at the baptism of\r\nClovis, King of the Franks, the Virgin (whose emblem the lily has always\r\nbeen) sent a lily by an angel as a mark of her special favour. It is\r\ndifficult to determine the exact date at which this tradition was invented,\r\nbut its accepted character may be judged from the fact that it was solemnly\r\nadvanced by the French bishops at the Council of Trent in a dispute as to\r\nthe precedence of their sovereign. The old legend as to Clovis would\r\nnaturally identify the flower with him, and it should be noted that the\r\nnames Clovis, Lois, Loys, and Louis are identical. \"Loys\" was the signature\r\nof the kings of France until the time of Louis XIII. It is worth the\r\npassing conjecture that what are sometimes termed \"Cleves lilies\" may be a\r\ncorrupted form of Clovis lilies. There can be little doubt that the term\r\n\"fleur-de-lis\" is quite as likely to be a corruption of \"fleur-de-lois\" as\r\nflower of the lily. The chief point is that the desire was to represent a\r\n_flower_ in allusion to the old legend, without perhaps any very definite\r\ncertainty of the flower intended to be represented. Philip I. on his seal\r\n(A.D. 1060) holds a short staff terminating in a fleur-de-lis. The same\r\nobject occurs in the great seal of Louis VII. In the seal of his wife,\r\nQueen Constance, we find her represented as holding in either hand a\r\nsimilar object, though in these last cases it is by no means certain that\r\nthe objects are not attempts to represent the natural flower. A signet\r\n{274} of Louis VII. bears a single fleur-de-lis \"florencée\" (or flowered),\r\nand in his reign the heraldic fleur-de-lis undoubtedly became stereotyped\r\nas a symbolical device, for we find that when in the lifetime of Louis VII.\r\nhis son Philip was crowned, the king prescribed that the prince should wear\r\n\"ses chausses appelées sandales ou bottines de soye, couleur bleu azuré\r\nsémée en moult endroits de fleurs-de-lys or, puis aussi sa dalmatique de\r\nmême couleur et oeuvre.\" On the oval counter-seal of Philip II. (d. 1223)\r\nappears a heraldic fleur-de-lis. His great seal, as also that of Louis\r\nVIII., shows a seated figure crowned with an open crown of \"fleurons,\" and\r\nholding in his right hand a flower, and in his left a sceptre surmounted by\r\na heraldic fleur-de-lis enclosed within a lozenge-shaped frame. On the seal\r\nof Louis VIII. the conjunction of the essentially heraldic fleur-de-lis\r\n(within the lozenge-shaped head of the sceptre), and the more natural\r\nflower held in the hand, should leave little if any doubt of the intention\r\nto represent flowers in the French fleurs-de-lis. The figure held in the\r\nhand represents a flower of five petals. The upper pair turned inwards to\r\ntouch the centre one, and the lower pair curved downwards, leave the figure\r\nwith a marked resemblance both to the iris and to the conventional\r\nfleur-de-lis. The counter-seal of Louis VIII. shows a Norman-shaped shield\r\nsemé of fleurs-de-lis of the conventional heraldic pattern. By then, of\r\ncourse, \"Azure, semé-de-lis or\" had become the fixed and determined arms of\r\nFrance. By an edict dated 1376, Charles V. reduced the number of\r\nfleurs-de-lis in his shield to three: \"Pour symboliser la Sainte-Trinite.\"\r\n\r\nThe claim of Edward III. to the throne of France was made on the death of\r\nCharles IV. of France in 1328, but the decision being against him, he\r\napparently acquiesced, and did homage to Philip of Valois (Philip VI.) for\r\nGuienne. Philip, however, lent assistance to David II. of Scotland against\r\nKing Edward, who immediately renewed his claim to France, assumed the arms\r\nand the title of king of that country, and prepared for war. He commenced\r\nhostilities in 1339, and upon his new Great Seal (made in the early part of\r\n1340) we find his arms represented upon shield, surcoat, and housings as:\r\n\"Quarterly, 1 and 4, azure, semé-de-lis or (for France); 2 and 3, gules,\r\nthree lions passant guardant in pale or (for England).\" The Royal Arms thus\r\nremained until 1411, when upon the second Great Seal of Henry IV. the\r\nfleurs-de-lis in England (as in France) were reduced to three in number,\r\nand so remained as part of the Royal Arms of this country until the latter\r\npart of the reign of George III.\r\n\r\nFleurs-de-lis (probably intended as badges only) had figured upon all the\r\nGreat Seals of Edward III. On the first seal (which with slight alterations\r\nhad also served for both Edward I. and II.), a small {275} fleur-de-lis\r\nappears over each of the castles which had previously figured on either\r\nside of the throne. In the second Great Seal, fleurs-de-lis took the places\r\nof the castles.\r\n\r\nThe similarity of the Montgomery arms to the Royal Arms of France has led\r\nto all kinds of wild genealogical conjectures, but at a time when the arms\r\nof France were hardly determinate, the seal of John de Mundegumbri is met\r\nwith, bearing a single fleur-de-lis, the original from which the arms of\r\nMontgomery were developed. Letters of nobility and the name of Du Lis were\r\ngranted by Charles VII. in December 1429 to the brothers of Joan of Arc,\r\nand the following arms were then assigned to them: \"Azure, a sword in pale\r\nproper, hilted and supporting on its point an open crown or, between two\r\nfleurs-de-lis of the last.\"\r\n\r\nThe fleur-de-lis \"florencée,\" or the \"fleur-de-lis flowered,\" as it is\r\ntermed in England, is officially considered a distinct charge from the\r\nsimple fleur-de-lis. Eve employs the term \"seeded,\" and remarks of it:\r\n\"This being one of the numerous instances of pedantic, because unnecessary\r\ndistinction, which showed marks of decadence; for both forms occur at the\r\nsame period, and adorn the same object, evidently with the same intention.\"\r\nThe difference between these forms really is that the fleur-de-lis is\r\n\"seeded\" when a stalk having seeds at the end issues in the upper\r\ninterstices. In a fleur-de-lis \"florencée,\" the natural flower of a lily\r\nissues instead of the seeded stalk. This figure formed the arms of the city\r\nof Florence.\r\n\r\nFleurs-de-lis, like all other Royal emblems, are frequently to be met with\r\nin the arms of towns, _e.g._ in the arms of Lancaster, Maryborough,\r\nWakefield, and Great Torrington. The arms of Wareham afford an instance of\r\nfleurs-de-lis reversed, and the Corporate Seals of Liskeard and Tamworth\r\nmerit reproduction, did space permit, from the designs of the fleurs-de-lis\r\nwhich there appear. One cannot leave the fleur-de-lis without referring to\r\none curious development of it, viz. the leopard's face jessant-de-lis (Fig.\r\n332), a curious charge which undoubtedly originated in the arms of the\r\nfamily of Cantelupe. This charge is not uncommon, though by no means so\r\nusual as the leopard's face. Planché considers that it was originally\r\nderived from the fleur-de-lis, the circular boss which in early\r\nrepresentations so often figures as the centre of the fleur-de-lis, being\r\nmerely _decorated_ with the leopard's face. One can follow Planché a bit\r\nfurther by imagining that this face need not necessarily be that of a\r\nleopard, for at a certain period all decorative art was crowded with\r\ngrotesque masks whenever opportunity offered. The leopard's face\r\njessant-de-lis is now represented as a leopard's face with the lower part\r\nof a fleur-de-lis issuing from the mouth, and the upper part rising from\r\nbehind the head. Instances of {276} this charge occur as early as the\r\nthirteenth century as the arms of the Cantelupe family, and Thomas de\r\nCantelupe having been Bishop of Hereford 1275 to 1282, the arms of that See\r\nhave since been three leopards' faces jessant-de-lis, the distinction being\r\nthat in the arms of the See of Hereford the leopards' faces are reversed.\r\n\r\nThe origin may perhaps make itself apparent when we remember that the\r\nearliest form of the name was Cantelowe. Is it not probable that \"lions'\"\r\nfaces (_i.e._ head _de leo_) may have been suggested by the name? Possibly,\r\nhowever, wolf-heads may have been meant, suggested by _lupus_, or by the\r\nsame analogy which gives us wolf-heads or wolves upon the arms of Low and\r\nLowe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 495.--Pomegranate.]\r\n\r\nFruit--the remaining division of those charges which can be classed as\r\nbelonging to the vegetable kingdom--must of necessity be but briefly dealt\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n_Grapes_ perhaps cannot be easily distinguished from vines (to which refer,\r\npage 264), but the arms of Bradway of Potscliff, co. Gloucester [\"Argent, a\r\nchevron gules between three bunches of grapes proper\"] and of Viscountess\r\nBeaconsfield, the daughter of Captain John Viney Evans [\"Argent, a bunch of\r\ngrapes stalked and leaved proper, between two flaunches sable, each charged\r\nwith a boar's head argent\"] are instances in point.\r\n\r\n_Apples_ occur in the arms of Robert Applegarth (Edward III. Roll)\r\n[\"Argent, three apples slipped gules\"] and \"Or, a chevron between three\r\napples gules\" is the coat of a family named Southbey.\r\n\r\n_Pears_ occur in the arms of Allcroft, of Stokesay Castle, Perrins, Perry,\r\nPerryman, and Pirie.\r\n\r\n_Oranges_ are but seldom met with in British heraldry, but an instance\r\noccurs in the arms of Lord Polwarth, who bears over the Hepburn quarterings\r\nan inescutcheon azure, an orange slipped and surmounted by an imperial\r\ncrown all proper. This was an augmentation conferred by King William III.,\r\nand a very similar augmentation (in the 1st and 4th quarters, azure, three\r\noranges slipped proper within an orle of thistles or) was granted to\r\nLivingstone, Viscount Teviot.\r\n\r\n_The Pomegranate_ (Fig. 495), which dimidiated with a rose was one of the\r\nbadges of Queen Mary, is not infrequently met with.\r\n\r\n_The Pineapple_ in heraldry is nearly always the fir-cone. In the arms of\r\nPerring, Bart. [\"Argent, on a chevron engrailed sable between three\r\npineapples (fir-cones) pendent vert, as many leopards' faces of the first.\r\nCrest: on a mount a pineapple (fir-cone) vert\"], and in the crest of\r\nParkyns, Bart. [\"Out of a ducal coronet or, a pineapple {277} proper\"], and\r\nalso in the arms of Pyne [\"Gules, a chevron ermine between three pineapples\r\nor\"] and Parkin-Moore, the fruit is the fir or pine cone. Latterly the\r\nlikelihood of confusion has led to the general use of the term \"pine-cone\"\r\nin such cases, but the ancient description was certainly \"pineapple.\" The\r\narms of John Apperley, as given in the Edward III. Roll, are: \"Argent, a\r\nchevron gules between three pineapples (fir-cones) vert, slipped or.\"\r\n\r\nThe real pineapple of the present day does, however, occur, _e.g._ in the\r\narms of Benson, of Lutwyche, Shropshire [\"Argent, on waves of the sea, an\r\nold English galley all proper, on a chief wavy azure a hand couped at the\r\nwrist, supporting on a dagger the scales of Justice between two pineapples\r\nerect or, leaved vert. Mantling azure and argent. Crest: upon a wreath of\r\nthe colours, a horse caparisoned, passant, proper, on the breast a shield\r\nargent, charged with a pineapple proper. Motto: 'Leges arma tenent\r\nsanctas'\"].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 496.--Acorn slipped and leaved.]\r\n\r\n_Bean-Pods_ occur in the arms of Rise of Trewardreva, co. Cornwall\r\n[\"Argent, a chevron gules between three bean-pods vert\"], and Papworth\r\nmentions in the arms of Messarney an instance of cherries [\"Or, a chevron\r\nper pale gules and vert between three cherries of the second slipped of the\r\nthird\"]. Elsewhere, however, the charges on the shield of this family are\r\ntermed apples. Strawberries occur in the arms and crest of Hollist, and the\r\narms of Duffield are: \"Sable, a chevron between three cloves or.\" The arms\r\nof the Grocers' Livery Company, granted in 1531-1532, are: \"Argent, a\r\nchevron gules between nine cloves, three, three and three.\" The arms of\r\nGarwynton are stated to be: \"Sable, a chevron between three heads of\r\ngarlick pendent argent,\" but another version gives the charges as\r\npomegranates. \"Azure, a chevron between three gourds pendent, slipped or\"\r\nis a coat attributed to Stukele, but here again there is uncertainty, as\r\nthe charges are sometimes quoted as pears. The arms of Bonefeld are:\r\n\"Azure, a chevron between three quinces or.\" The arms of Alderberry are\r\nnaturally: \"Argent, three branches of alder-berries proper.\" The arms of\r\nHaseley of Suffolk are: \"Argent, a fess gules, between three hazel-nuts or,\r\nstalks and leaves vert.\" Papworth also mentions the arms of Tarsell, viz.:\r\n\"Or, a chevron sable, between three hazel-nuts erect, slipped gules.\" It\r\nwould, however, seem more probable that these charges are really teazles.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the oak--the _Acorn_ (Fig. 496)--has already been incidentally\r\nreferred to, but other instances occur in the arms of Baldwin, Stable, and\r\nHuth. {278}\r\n\r\nWheat and other grain is constantly met with in British armory. The arms of\r\nBigland [\"Azure, two ears of big wheat erect in fess and bladed or\"] and of\r\nCheape are examples, and others occur in the arms of Layland-Barratt,\r\nCross, and Rye [\"Gules, on a bend argent, between two ears of rye, stalked,\r\nleaved, and slipped or, three crosses cramponné sable\"].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 497.--Garb.]\r\n\r\n_Garbs_, as they are invariably termed heraldically, are sheaves, and are\r\nof very frequent occurrence. The earliest appearance of the garb (Fig. 497)\r\nin English heraldry is on the seal of Ranulph, Earl of Chester, who died in\r\n1232. Garbs therefrom became identified with the Earldom of Chester, and\r\nsubsequently \"Azure, three garbs or\" became and still remain the\r\nterritorial or possibly the sovereign coat of that earldom. Garbs naturally\r\nfigure, therefore, in the arms of many families who originally held land by\r\nfeudal tenure under the Earls of Chester, e.g. the families of Cholmondeley\r\n[\"Gules, in chief two helmets in profile argent, and in base a garb vert\"]\r\nand Kevilioc [\"Azure, six garbs, three, two, and one or\"]. Grosvenor\r\n[\"Azure, a garb or\"] is usually quoted as another example, and possibly\r\ncorrectly, but a very interesting origin has been suggested by Mr. W. G.\r\nTaunton in his work \"The Tauntons of Oxford, by One of Them\":--\r\n\r\n\"I merely wish to make a few remarks of my own that seem to have escaped\r\nother writers on genealogical matters.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, Sir Gilbert le Grosvenor, who is stated to have come\r\nover with William of Normandy at the Conquest, is described as nephew to\r\nHugh Lupus, Earl of Chester; but Hugh Lupus was himself nephew to King\r\nWilliam. Now, William could not have been very old when he overthrew Harold\r\nat Hastings. It seems, therefore, rather improbable that Sir Gilbert le\r\nGrosvenor, who was his nephew's nephew, could actually have fought with him\r\nat Hastings, especially when William lived to reign for twenty-one years\r\nafter, and was not very old when he died.\r\n\r\n\"The name Grosvenor does not occur in any of the versions of the Roll of\r\nBattle Abbey. Not that any of these versions of this celebrated Roll are\r\nconsidered authentic by modern critics, who say that many names were\r\nsubsequently added by the monks to please ambitious parvenus. The name\r\nVenour is on the Roll, however, and it is just possible that this Venour\r\nwas the Grosvenor of our quest. The addition of 'Gros' would then be\r\nsubsequent to his fattening on the spoils of the Saxon and cultivating a\r\ncorporation. 'Venour' means hunter, and {279} 'Gros' means fat. Gilbert's\r\nuncle, Hugh Lupus, was, we know, a fat man; in fact, he was nicknamed 'Hugh\r\nthe Fat.' The Grosvenors of that period probably inherited obesity from\r\ntheir relative, Hugh Lupus, therefore, and the fable that they were called\r\nGrosvenor on account of their office of 'Great Huntsman' to the Dukes of\r\nNormandy is not to be relied on.\r\n\r\n\"We are further on told by the old family historians that when Sir Robert\r\nGrosvenor lost the day in that ever-memorable controversy with Sir Richard\r\nle Scrope, Baron of Bolton, concerning the coat of arms--'Azure, a bend\r\nor'--borne by both families, Sir Robert Grosvenor took for his arms one of\r\nthe garbs of his kinsman, the Earl of Chester.\r\n\r\n\"It did not seem to occur to these worthies that the Earl of Chester, who\r\nwas their ancestor's uncle, never bore the garbs in his arms, but a wolf's\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"It is true that one or two subsequent Earls of Chester bore garbs, but\r\nthese Earls were far too distantly connected with the Grosvenors to render\r\nit likely that the latter would borrow their new arms from this source.\r\n\r\n\"It is curious that there should have been in this same county of Chester a\r\nfamily of almost identical name also bearing a garb in their arms, though\r\ntheir garb was surrounded by three bezants.\r\n\r\n\"The name of this family was Grasvenor, or Gravenor, and, moreover, the\r\ntinctures of their arms were identical with those of Grosvenor. It is far\r\nmore likely, therefore, that the coat assumed by Sir Robert after the\r\nadverse decision of the Court of Chivalry was taken from that of Grasvenor,\r\nor Gravenor, and that the two families were known at that time to be of\r\ncommon origin, although their connection with each other has subsequently\r\nbeen lost.\r\n\r\n\"In French both _gros_ and _gras_ mean fat, and we have both forms in\r\nGrosvenor and Grasvenor.\r\n\r\n\"A chief huntsman to Royalty would have been Grandvenor, not Grosvenor or\r\nGrasvenor.\r\n\r\n\"All these criticisms of mine, however, only affect the origin of the arms,\r\nand not the ancient and almost Royal descent of this illustrious race. Hugh\r\nLupus, Earl of Chester, was a son of the Duke of Brittany, as is plainly\r\nstated in his epitaph.\r\n\r\n\"This connection of uncle and nephew, then, between 'Hugh the Fat' and\r\nGilbert Grosvenor implies a maternal descent from the Dukes of Brittany for\r\nthe first ancestor of the Grosvenor family.\r\n\r\n\"In virtue of their descent from an heiress of the house of Grosvenor, it\r\nis only necessary to add the Tauntons of Oxford are Grosvenors,\r\nheraldically speaking, and that quartering so many ancient coats through\r\n{280} the Tanners and the Grosvenors with our brand-new grant is like\r\nputting old wine into new bottles.\r\n\r\n\"Hugh Lupus left no son to succeed him, and the subsequent descent of the\r\nEarldom of Chester was somewhat erratic. So I think there is some point in\r\nmy arguments regarding the coat assumed by Sir Robert Grosvenor of Hulme.\"\r\n\r\nThough a garb, unless quoted otherwise, is presumed to be a sheaf of wheat,\r\nthe term is not so confined. The garbs in the arms of Comyn, which figure\r\nas a quartering in so many Scottish coats, are really of cummin, as\r\npresumably are the garbs in the arms of Cummins. When a garb is \"banded\" of\r\na different colour this should be stated, and Elvin states that it may be\r\n\"eared\" of a different colour, though I confess I am aware of no such\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n\"Argent, two bundles of reeds in fess vert,\" is the coat of Janssen of\r\nWimbledon, Surrey (Bart., extinct), and a bundle of rods occurs in the arms\r\nof Evans, and the crest of Harris, though in this latter case it is termed\r\na faggot.\r\n\r\n_Reeds_ also occur in the crest of Reade, and the crest of Middlemore [\"On\r\na wreath of colours, a moorcock amidst grass and reeds proper\"] furnishes\r\nanother example.\r\n\r\n_Bulrushes_ occur in the crest of Billiat, and in the arms of Scott\r\n[\"Argent, on a mount of bulrushes in base proper, a bull passant sable, a\r\nchief pean, billetté or\"].\r\n\r\n_Grass_ is naturally presumed on the mounts vert which are so constantly\r\nmet with, but more definite instances can be found in the arms of Sykes,\r\nHulley, and Hill. {281}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nINANIMATE OBJECTS\r\n\r\nIn dealing with those charges which may be classed under the above\r\ndescription one can safely say that there is scarcely an object under the\r\nsun which has not at some time or other been introduced into a coat of arms\r\nor crest. One cannot usefully make a book on armory assume the character of\r\na general encyclopædia of useful knowledge, and reference will only be made\r\nin this chapter to a limited number, including those which from frequent\r\nusage have obtained a recognised heraldic character. Mention may, at the\r\noutset, be made of certain letters of the _alphabet_. Instances of these\r\nare scarcely common, but the family of Kekitmore may be adduced as bearing\r\n\"Gules, three S's or,\" while Bridlington Priory had for arms: \"Per pale,\r\nsable and argent, three B's counterchanged.\" The arms of Rashleigh are:\r\n\"Sable, a cross or, between in the first quarter a Cornish chough argent,\r\nbeaked and legged gules; in the second a text T; in the third and fourth a\r\ncrescent all argent.\" Corporate arms (in England) afford an instance of\r\nalphabetical letters in the case of the B's on the shield of Bermondsey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 498.--Anchor.]\r\n\r\n_The Anchor_ (Fig. 498).--This charge figures very largely in English\r\narmory, as may, perhaps, be looked for when it is remembered that maritime\r\ndevices occur more frequently in sea-board lands than in continents. The\r\narms of the town of Musselburgh are: \"Azure, three anchors in pale, one in\r\nthe chief and two in the flanks or, accompanied with as many mussels, one\r\nin the dexter and one in the sinister chief points, and the third in base\r\nproper.\" The Comtes de St. Cricq, with \"Argent, two anchors in saltire\r\nsable, on a chief three mullets or,\" will be an instance in point as to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n_Anvils._--These are occasionally met with, as in the case of the arms of a\r\nfamily of the name of Walker, who bear: \"Argent, on a chevron gules,\r\nbetween two anvils in chief and an anchor in base sable, a bee between two\r\ncrescents or. Mantling gules and argent. {282} Crest: upon a wreath of the\r\ncolours, on a mount within a wreathed serpent a dove all statant proper.\"\r\n\r\nArches, castles, towers, and turrets may be exemplified, amongst others, by\r\nthe following.\r\n\r\nInstances of _Castles_ and _Towers_ will be found in the arms of Carlyon\r\nand Kelly, and of the former fractured castles will be found in the shield\r\nof Willoughby quartered by Bertie; while an example of a quadrangular\r\ncastle may be seen in the arms of Rawson. The difference between a Castle\r\n(Fig. 499) and a Tower (Fig. 500) should be carefully noticed, and though\r\nit is a distinction but little observed in ancient days it is now always\r\nadhered to. When either castle or tower is surmounted by smaller towers (as\r\nFig. 501) it is termed \"triple-towered.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 499.--Castle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 500.--Tower.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 501.--Tower triple-towered.]\r\n\r\nAn instance of a _Fortification_ as a charge occurs in the shield of\r\nSconce: \"Azure, a fortification (sconce) argent, masoned sable, in the\r\ndexter chief point a mullet of six points of the second.\"\r\n\r\n_Gabions_ were hampers filled with earth, and were used in the construction\r\nof fortifications and earthworks. They are of occasional occurrence in\r\nEnglish armory at any rate, and may be seen in the shields of Christie and\r\nof Goodfellow.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Banks supply an instance of _Arches_. Mention may here perhaps\r\nbe made of William Arches, who bore at the siege of Rouen: \"Gules, three\r\ndouble arches argent.\" The family of Lethbridge bear a bridge, and this\r\ncharge figures in a number of other coats.\r\n\r\n_An Abbey_ occurs in the arms of Maitland of Dundrennan [\"Argent, the ruins\r\nof an old abbey on a piece of ground all proper\"], and a monastery in that\r\nof McLarty [\"Azure, the front of an ancient monastery argent\"]. A somewhat\r\nisolated instance of a _Temple_ occurs in the shield of Templer.\r\n\r\nA curious canting grant of arms may be seen in that to the town of Eccles,\r\nin which the charge is an _Ecclesiastical Building_, and similar {283}\r\nthough somewhat unusual charges figure also in the quartering for Chappel\r\n[\"Per chevron or and azure, in chief a mullet of six points between two\r\ncrosses patée of the last, and in base the front elevation of a chapel\r\nargent\"], borne by Brown-Westhead.\r\n\r\n_Arrows_ are very frequently found, and the arms of Hales supply one of the\r\nmany examples of this charge, while a bow--without the arrows--may be\r\ninstanced in the shield of Bowes: \"Ermine, three bows bent and stringed\r\npalewise in fess proper.\"\r\n\r\n_Arrow-Heads_ and _Pheons_ are of common usage, and occur in the arms of\r\nFoster and many other families. Pheons, it may be noticed in passing, are\r\narrow-heads with an inner engrailed edge (Fig. 502), while when depicted\r\nwithout this peculiarity they are termed \"broad arrows\" (Fig. 503). This is\r\nnot a distinction very stringently adhered to.\r\n\r\nCharges associated with warfare and military defences are frequently to be\r\nfound both in English and foreign heraldry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 502.--Pheon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 503.--Broad arrow.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 504.--Battle-axe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 505.--Caltrap.]\r\n\r\n_Battle-Axes_ (Fig. 504), for example, may be seen in the shield of Firth\r\nand in that of Renty in Artois, which has: \"Argent, three doloires, or\r\nbroad-axes, gules, those in chief addorsed.\" In blazoning a battle-axe care\r\nshould be taken to specify the fact if the head is of a different colour,\r\nas is frequently the case.\r\n\r\nThe somewhat infrequent device of a _Battering-Ram_ is seen in the arms of\r\nBertie, who bore: \"Argent, three battering-rams fesswise in pale proper,\r\narmed and garnished azure.\"\r\n\r\nAn instrument of military defence consisting of an iron frame of four\r\npoints, and called a _Caltrap_ (Fig. 505) or _Galtrap_ (and sometimes a\r\nCheval trap, from its use of impeding the approach of cavalry), is found in\r\nthe arms of Trappe [\"Argent, three caltraps sable\"], Gilstrap and other\r\nfamilies; while French armory supplies us with another example in {284} the\r\ncase of the family of Guetteville de Guénonville, who bore for arms:\r\n\"D'argent, semée de chausse-trapes de sable.\" Caltraps are also strewn upon\r\nthe compartment upon which the supporters to the arms of the Earl of Perth\r\nare placed.\r\n\r\nAs the well-known badge of the Royal House of Tudor, the _Portcullis_ (Fig.\r\n506) is familiar to any one conversant with Henry VII.'s Chapel at\r\nWestminster Abbey, but it also appears as a charge in the arms of the\r\nfamily of Wingate [\"Gules, a portcullis and a chief embattled or\"], where\r\nit forms an obvious pun on the earliest form of the name, viz. Windygate,\r\nwhilst it figures also as the crest of the Dukes of Beaufort [\"A portcullis\r\nor, nailed azure, chained of the first\"]. The disposition of the chains is\r\na matter always left to the discretion of the artist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 506.--Portcullis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 507.--Beacon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 508.--Grenade.]\r\n\r\nExamples of _Beacons_ (Fig. 507) are furnished by the achievements of the\r\nfamily of Compton and of the town of Wolverhampton. A _fire chest_ occurs\r\nin the arms of Critchett (_vide_ p. 261).\r\n\r\n_Chains_ are singularly scarce in armory, and indeed nearly wholly absent\r\nas _charges_, usually occurring where they do as part of the crest. The\r\nEnglish shield of Anderton, it is true, bears: \"Sable, three chains\r\nargent;\" while another one (Duppa de Uphaugh) has: \"Quarterly, 1 and 4, a\r\nlion's paw couped in fess between two chains or, a chief nebuly of the\r\nlast, thereon two roses of the first, barbed and seeded proper (for Duppa);\r\n2 and 3, party fess azure and sable, a trident fesswise or, between three\r\nturbots argent (for Turbutt).\" In Continental heraldry, however, chains are\r\nmore frequently met with. Principal amongst these cases maybe cited the\r\narms of Navarre (\"Gules, a cross saltire and double orle of chains, linked\r\ntogether or\"), while many other instances are found in the armories of\r\nSouthern France and of Spain.\r\n\r\n_Bombs_ or _Grenades_ (Fig. 508), for Heraldry does not distinguish, figure\r\nin the shields of Vavasseur, Jervoise, Boycott, and many other families.\r\n{285}\r\n\r\nAmong the more recent grants _Cannon_ have figured, as in the case of the\r\nPilter arms and in those of the burgh of Portobello; while an earlier\r\ncounterpart, in the form of a culverin, forms the charge of the Leigh\r\nfamily: \"Argent, a culverin in fess sable.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 509.--Scaling ladder.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 510.--Lance or javelin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 511.--Tilting-spear.]\r\n\r\nThe _Column_ appears as a crest in the achievement of Coles. Between two\r\ncross crosslets it occurs in the arms of Adam of Maryburgh [\"Vert, a\r\nCorinthian column with capital and base in pale proper, between two cross\r\ncrosslets fitchée in fess or\"], while the arms of the See of Sodor and Man\r\nare blazoned: \"Argent, upon a pedestal the Virgin Mary with her arms\r\nextended between two pillars, in the dexter hand a church proper, in base\r\nthe arms of Man in an escutcheon.\" Major, of Suffolk, bears: \"Azure, three\r\nCorinthian columns, each surmounted by a ball, two and one argent.\" It is\r\nnecessary to specify the kind of column in the blazon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 512.--Arms of William Shakespeare the poet (d. 1616):\r\nOr, on a bend sable, a tilting-spear of the field.]\r\n\r\n_Scaling-Ladders_ (Fig. 509) (viz. ordinary-shaped ladders with grapnels\r\naffixed to the tops) are to be seen in the English coats of D'Urban and\r\nLloyd, while the Veronese Princes della Scala bore the ordinary ladder:\r\n\"Gules, a ladder of four steps in pale argent.\" A further instance of this\r\nform of the charge occurs in the Swiss shield of Laiterberg: \"Argent, two\r\nladders in saltire gules.\"\r\n\r\n_Spears_ and _Spear-Heads_ are to be found in the arms of many families\r\nboth in England, Wales, and abroad; for example, in the arms of Amherst and\r\nEdwards. Distinction must be drawn between the lance or javelin (Fig. 510)\r\nand the heraldic tilting-spear (Fig. 511), particularly as the latter is\r\nalways depicted with the sharp point for warfare instead of the blunted\r\npoint which was actually used in the tournament. The Shakespeare arms (Fig.\r\n512) are: \"Or, on a bend sable a tilting-spear of the field,\" while \"Azure,\r\na lance or enfiled {286} at its point by an annulet argent\" represents the\r\nFrench family of Danby.\r\n\r\n_Spurs_ (Fig. 513) occur in coat armour as such in the arms of Knight and\r\nHarben, and also occasionally \"winged\" (Fig. 514), as in the crest of\r\nJohnston.\r\n\r\n_Spur-Rowels_, or _Spur-Revels_, are to be met with under that name, but\r\nthey are, and are more often termed, \"mullets of five points pierced.\"\r\n\r\nExamples of _Stirrups_ are but infrequent, and the best-known one (as\r\nregards English armory) is that of Scudamore, while the Polish Counts\r\nBrzostowski bore: \"Gules, a stirrup argent, within a bordure or.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 513.--Spur.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 514.--Winged spur.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 515.--Sword.]\r\n\r\n_Stones_ are even more rare, though a solitary example may be quoted in the\r\narms of Staniland: Per pale or and vert, a pale counterchanged, three\r\neagles displayed two and one, and as many flint-stones one and two all\r\nproper. The \"vigilance\" of the crane has been already alluded to on page\r\n247. The mention of stones brings one to the kindred subject of\r\n_Catapults_. These engines of war, needless to say on a very much larger\r\nscale than the object which is nowadays associated with the term, were also\r\nknown by the name _balistæ_, and also by that of _swepe_. Their occurrence\r\nis very infrequent, but for that very reason one may, perhaps, draw\r\nattention to the arms of the (English) family of Magnall: \"Argent, a swepe\r\nazure, charged with a stone or.\"\r\n\r\n_Swords_, differing in number, position, and kind are, perhaps, of this\r\nclass of charge the most numerous. A single sword as a charge may be seen\r\nin the shield of Dick of Wicklow, and Macfie, and a sword entwined by a\r\nserpent in that of Mackesy. A flaming sword occurs in the arms of Maddocks\r\nand Lewis. Swords frequently figure, too, in the hands or paws of\r\nsupporters, accordingly as the latter are human figures or animals, whilst\r\nthey figure as the \"supporters\" themselves in the unique case of the French\r\nfamily of Bastard, whose shield is cottised by \"two swords, point in base.\"\r\nThe heraldic sword is represented as Fig. 515, the blade of the _dagger_\r\n{287} being shorter and more pointed. The _scymitar_ follows the form\r\ndepicted in Fig. 516.\r\n\r\nA _Seax_ is the term employed to denote a curved scimitar, or falchion,\r\nhaving a notch at the back of the blade (Fig. 517). In heraldry the use of\r\nthis last is fairly frequent, though generally, it must be added, in\r\nshields of arms of doubtful authority. As such they are to be seen, amongst\r\nothers, in the reputed arms of Middlesex, and owing to this origin they\r\nwere included in the grant of arms to the town of Ealing. The sabre and the\r\ncutlass when so blazoned follow their utilitarian patterns.\r\n\r\n_Torches_ or _Firebrands_ are depicted in the arms and crest of Gillman and\r\nTyson.\r\n\r\n_Barnacles_ (or _Breys_)--horse curbs--occur in some of the earlier coats,\r\nas in the arms of Wyatt [\"Gules, a barnacle argent\"], while another family\r\nof the same name (or, possibly, Wyot) bore: \"Per fess gules and azure (one\r\nor) three barnacles argent\".\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 516.--Scymitar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 517.--Seax.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 518.--Church-bell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 519.--Hawk's bell.]\r\n\r\n_Bells_ are well instanced in the shield of Porter, and the poet Wordsworth\r\nbore: \"Argent, three bells azure.\" It may be noted in passing that in\r\nContinental armory the clapper is frequently of a different tincture to\r\nthat of the bell, as, for instance, \"D'Azure, à la cloche d'argent,\r\nbutaillé [viz. with the clapper] de sable\"--the arms of the Comtes de\r\nBellegarse. A bell is assumed to be a church-bell (Fig. 518) unless\r\nblazoned as a hawk's bell (Fig. 519).\r\n\r\n_Bridle-Bits_ are of very infrequent use, though they may be seen in the\r\nachievement of the family of Milner.\r\n\r\nThe _Torse_ (or wreath surmounting the helm) occasionally figures as a\r\ncharge, for example, in the arms of Jocelyn and Joslin.\r\n\r\n_The Buckle_ is a charge which is of much more general use than some of the\r\nforegoing. It appears very frequently both in English {288} and foreign\r\nheraldry--sometimes oval-shaped (Fig. 520), circular (Fig. 521), or square\r\n(Fig. 522), but more generally lozenge-shaped (Fig. 523), especially in the\r\ncase of Continental arms. A somewhat curious variation occurs in the arms\r\nof the Prussian Counts Wallenrodt, which are: \"Gules, a lozenge-shaped\r\nbuckle argent, the tongue broken in the middle.\" It is, of course, purely\r\nan artistic detail in all these buckles whether the tongue is attached to a\r\ncrossbar, as in Figs. 520 and 521, or not, as in Figs. 522 and 523. As a\r\nbadge the buckle is used by the Pelhams, Earls of Chichester and Earls of\r\nYarborough, and a lozenge-shaped arming buckle is the badge of Jerningham.\r\n\r\n_Cups_ (covered) appear in the Butler arms, and derived therefrom in the\r\narms of the town of Warrington. Laurie, of Maxwelltown, bear: \"Sable, a cup\r\nargent, issuing therefrom a garland between two laurel-branches all\r\nproper,\" and similar arms are registered in Ireland for Lowry. The Veronese\r\nfamily of Bicchieri bear: \"Argent, a fess gules between three\r\ndrinking-glasses half-filled with red wine proper.\" An uncovered cup occurs\r\nin the arms of Fox, derived by them from the crest of Croker, and another\r\ninstance occurs in the arms of a family of Smith. In this connection we may\r\nnote in passing the rare use of the device of a _Vase_, which forms a\r\ncharge in the coat of the town of Burslem, whilst it is also to be met with\r\nin the crest of the family of Doulton: \"On a wreath of the colours, a\r\ndemi-lion sable, holding in the dexter paw a cross crosslet or, and resting\r\nthe sinister upon an escutcheon charged with a vase proper.\" The motto is\r\nperhaps well worth recording; \"Le beau est la splendeur de vrai.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 520.--Oval buckle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 521.--Circular buckle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 522.--Square buckle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 523.--Lozenge-shaped buckle.]\r\n\r\nThe arms of both the city of Dundee and the University of Aberdeen afford\r\ninstances of a _Pot of Lilies_, and _Bowls_ occur in the arms of Bolding.\r\n\r\nPLATE V.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{289}\r\n\r\nThough blazoned as a _Cauldron_, the device occurring in the crest of De la\r\nRue may be perhaps as fittingly described as an open bowl, and as such may\r\nfind a place in this classification: \"Between two olive-branches vert a\r\ncauldron gules, fired and issuant therefrom a snake nowed proper.\" The use\r\nof a _Pitcher_ occurs in the arms of Bertrand de Monbocher, who bore at the\r\nsiege of Carlaverock: \"Argent, three pitchers sable (sometimes found gules)\r\nwithin a bordure sable bezanté;\" and the arms of Standish are: \"Sable,\r\nthree standing dishes argent.\"\r\n\r\nThe somewhat singular charge of a _Chart_ appears in the arms of\r\nChristopher, and also as the crest of a Scottish family of Cook.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 524.--Chess-rook.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 525.--Crescent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 526.--Increscent.]\r\n\r\n_Chess-Rooks_ (Fig. 524) are somewhat favourite heraldic devices, and are\r\nto be met with in a shield of Smith and the arms of Rocke of Clungunford.\r\n\r\nThe _Crescent_ (Fig. 525) figures largely in all armories, both as a charge\r\nand (in English heraldry) as a difference.\r\n\r\nVariations, too, of the form of the crescent occur, such as when the horns\r\nare turned to the dexter (Fig. 526), when it is termed \"a crescent\r\nincrescent,\" or simply \"an increscent,\" or when they are turned to the\r\nsinister--when it is styled \"decrescent\" (Fig. 527). An instance of the\r\ncrescent \"reversed\" may be seen in the shield of the Austrian family of\r\nPuckberg, whose blazon was: \"Azure, three crescents, those in chief\r\naddorsed, that in base reversed.\" In English \"difference marks\" the\r\ncrescent is used to denote the second son, but under this character it will\r\nbe discussed later.\r\n\r\nIndependently of its use in conjunction with ecclesiastical armory, the\r\n_Crosier_ (Fig. 528) is not widely used in ordinary achievements. It does\r\noccur, however, as a principal charge, as in the arms of the Irish family\r\nof Crozier and in the arms of Benoit (in Dauphiny) [\"Gules, a pastoral\r\nstaff argent\"], while it forms part of the crest of Alford. The term\r\n\"crosier\" is synonymous with the pastoral or episcopal staff, and is\r\nindependent of the cross which is borne _before_ (and not _by_) {290}\r\nArchbishops and Metropolitans. The use of pastoral staves as charges is\r\nalso to be seen in the shield of Were, while MacLaurin of Dreghorn bears:\r\n\"Argent, a shepherd's crook sable.\" The _Palmer's Staff_ (Fig. 529) has\r\nbeen introduced into many coats of arms for families having the surname of\r\nPalmer, as has also the palmer's wallet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 527.--Decrescent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 528.--Crosier, or pastoral staff.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 529.--Palmer's staff.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 530.--Shuttle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 531.--Woolpack.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 532.--Escarbuncle.]\r\n\r\n_Cushions_, somewhat strangely, form the charges in a number of British\r\nshields, occurring, for example, in the arms of Brisbane, and on the shield\r\nof the Johnstone family. In Scottish heraldry, indeed, cushions appear to\r\nhave been of very ancient (and general) use, and are frequently to be met\r\nwith. The Earls of Moray bore: \"Argent, three cushions lozengewise within a\r\ndouble tressure flory-counterflory gules,\" but an English example occurs in\r\nthe arms of Hutton.\r\n\r\n_The Distaff_, which is supposed to be the origin of the lozenge upon which\r\na lady bears her arms, is seldom seen in heraldry, but the family of Body,\r\nfor instance, bear one in chief, and three occur in the arms of a family of\r\nLees.\r\n\r\n_The Shuttle_ (Fig. 530) occurs in the arms of Shuttleworth, and in those\r\nof the town of Leigh, while the shield of the borough of Pudsey affords an\r\nillustration of shuttles in conjunction with a woolpack (Fig. 531).\r\n\r\n_The Escarbuncle_ (Fig. 532) is an instance of a charge having so developed\r\nby the evolution of an integral part of the shield itself. In {291} ancient\r\nwarfare shields were sometimes strengthened by being bound with iron bands\r\nradiating from the centre, and these bands, from the shape they assumed,\r\nbecame in course of time a charge in themselves under the term escarbuncle.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the Fanmakers' Company is: \"A hand couped proper holding a\r\n_fan_ displayed,\" while the chief charge in the arms is \"... a fan\r\ndisplayed ... the sticks gules.\" This, however, is the only case I can cite\r\nof this object.\r\n\r\nThe _Fasces_ (Fig. 533), emblematic of the Roman magisterial office, is\r\nvery frequently introduced in grants of arms to Mayors and Lord Mayors,\r\nwhich no doubt accounts for its appearance in the arms of Durning-Lawrence,\r\nKnill, Evans, and Spokes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 533.--Fasces.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 534.--Fetterlock.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 535.--Fleam.]\r\n\r\nAn instance of _Fetterlocks_ (Fig. 534) occurs in the arms of Kirkwood, and\r\nalso in the coat of Lockhart and the crest of Wyndham. A chain is often\r\nsubstituted for the bow of the lock. The modern padlock has been introduced\r\ninto the grant of arms to the town of Wolverhampton.\r\n\r\n_Keys_, the emblem of St. Peter, and, as such, part of the insignia of His\r\nHoliness the Pope, occur in many ecclesiastical coats, the arms of the\r\nFishmongers' Livery Company, and many families.\r\n\r\n_Flames of Fire_ are not frequently met with, but they are to be found in\r\nthe arms of Baikie, and as crests they figure in the achievements of\r\nGraham-Wigan, and also in conjunction with keys in that of Flavel. In\r\nconnection with certain other objects flames are common enough. The phoenix\r\nalways issues from flames, and a salamander is always in the midst of\r\nflames (Fig. 437). The flaming sword, a device, by the way, included in the\r\nrecent grant to Sir George Lewis, Bart., has been already alluded to, as\r\nhas also the flaming brand. A notable example of the torch occurs in the\r\ncrest of Sir William Gull, Bart., no doubt an allusion (as is his\r\naugmentation) to the skill by which he kept the torch of life burning in\r\nthe then Prince of Wales during his serious illness in 1871. A flaming\r\nmountain occurs as the crest of several families of the name of Grant.\r\n{292}\r\n\r\nA curious instrument now known nearly exclusively in connection with its\r\nuse by farriers, and termed a _Fleam_ (Fig. 535), occurs on the chief of\r\nthe shield of Moore. A fleam, however, is the ancient form and name of a\r\nsurgeon's lancet, and some connection with surgery may be presumed when it\r\noccurs. It is one of the charges in the arms recently granted to Sir\r\nFrederick Treves, Bart.\r\n\r\n_Furison._--This singular charge occurs in the shield of Black, and also in\r\nthat of Steel. Furisons were apparently the instruments by which fire was\r\nstruck from flint stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 536.--Clarion.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 537.--Bugle-horn.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 538.--Bugle-horn stringed.]\r\n\r\nCharges in connection with music and musical instruments do not occur very\r\nfrequently, though the heraldic use of the _Clarion_ (Fig. 536) and the\r\n_Harp_ may perhaps be mentioned. The bugle-horn (Fig. 537) also occurs\r\n\"stringed\" (Fig. 538), and when the bands round it are of a different\r\ncolour it is termed \"veruled\" or \"virolled\" of that colour.\r\n\r\n_The Human Heart_, which should perhaps have been more correctly referred\r\nto in an earlier chapter, is a charge which is well known in heraldry, both\r\nEnglish and foreign. Perhaps the best known examples of the heart ensigned\r\nwith a crown is seen in the shields of Douglas and Johnstone. The legend\r\nwhich accounts for the appearance of this charge in the arms of Douglas is\r\ntoo well known to need repetition.\r\n\r\n_Ingots of silver_ occur in the shield of the borough of St. Helens, whilst\r\nthe family of Woollan go one better by bearing ingots of gold.\r\n\r\n_A Maunch_ (Fig. 539), which is a well-known heraldic term for the sleeve,\r\nis, as it is drawn, scarcely recognisable as such. Nevertheless its\r\nevolution can be clearly traced. The maunch--which, of course, as a\r\nheraldic charge, originated in the knightly \"favour\" of a lady's\r\nsleeve--was borne from the earliest periods in different tinctures by the\r\nthree historic families of Conyers, Hastings, and Wharton. Other garments\r\nhave been used as heraldic charges; gloves in the arms of {293} Fletcher\r\nand Barttelot; stockings in the arms of Hose; a boot in the crest of Hussy,\r\nand a hat in the arms of Huth. Armour is frequently met with, a cuirass\r\nappearing in the crest of Somers, helmets in the arms of Salvesen, Trayner,\r\nRoberton, and many other families, gauntlets (Fig. 540), which need to be\r\nspecified as dexter or sinister, in the arms of Vane and the crest of\r\nBurton, and a morion (Fig. 541) in the crest of Pixley. The Garter is, of\r\ncourse, due to that Order of knighthood; and the Blue Mantle of the same\r\nOrder, besides giving his title to one of the Pursuivants of Arms, who uses\r\nit as his badge, has also been used as a charge.\r\n\r\n_The Mill-rind_ or _Fer-de-moline_ is, of course, as its name implies, the\r\niron from the centre of a grindstone. It is depicted in varying forms, more\r\nor less recognisable as the real thing (Fig. 542).\r\n\r\n_Mirrors_ occur almost exclusively in crests and in connection with\r\nmermaids, who, as a general rule, are represented as holding one in the\r\ndexter hand with a comb in the sinister. Very occasionally, however,\r\nmirrors appear as charges, an example being that of the Counts Spiegel zum\r\nDesenberg, who bore: \"Gules, three round mirrors argent in square frames\r\nor.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 539.--Maunch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 540.--Gauntlet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 541.--Morion.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 542.--Mill-rind.]\r\n\r\nSymbols connected with the Sacred Passion--other than the cross itself--are\r\nnot of very general use in armory, though there are instances of the\r\n_Passion-Nails_ being used, as, for example, in the shield of Procter viz.:\r\n\"Or, three passion-nails sable.\"\r\n\r\n_Pelts, or Hides_, occur in the shield of Pilter, and the Fleece has been\r\nmentioned under the division of Rams and Sheep.\r\n\r\n_Plummets_ (or _Sinkers_ used by masons) form the charges in the arms of\r\nJennings.\r\n\r\nAn instance of a _Pyramid_ is met with in the crest of Malcolm, Bart., and\r\nan _Obelisk_ in that of the town of Todmorden. {294}\r\n\r\nThe shield of Crookes affords an example of two devices of very rare\r\noccurrence, viz. a _Prism_ and a _Radiometer_.\r\n\r\nWater, lakes, ships, &c., are constantly met with in armory, but a few\r\ninstances must suffice. The various methods of heraldically depicting water\r\nhave been already referred to (pages 88 and 151).\r\n\r\n_Three Wells_ figure in the arms of Hodsoll, and a masoned well in that of\r\nCamberwell. The shields of Stourton and Mansergh supply instances of\r\nheraldic _Fountains_, whilst the arms of Brunner and of Franco contain\r\nFountains of the ordinary kind. A _Tarn_, or _Loch_, occurs in the shield\r\nof the family of Tarn, while Lord Loch bears: \"Or, a saltire engrailed\r\nsable, between in fess two swans in water proper, all within a bordure\r\nvert.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 543.--Lymphad, sail furled.]\r\n\r\nThe use of _Ships_ may be instanced by the arms of many families, while a\r\n_Galley_ or _Lymphad_ (Fig. 543) occurs in the arms of Campbell, Macdonald,\r\nGalbraith, Macfie, and numerous other families, and also in the arms of the\r\ntown of Oban. Another instance of a coat of arms in which a galley appears\r\nwill be found in the arms recently granted to the burgh of Alloa, while the\r\ntowns of Wandsworth and Lerwick each afford instances of a _Dragon Ship_.\r\nThe _Prow of a Galley_ appears in the arms of Pitcher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 544.--Rainbow.]\r\n\r\nA modern form of ship in the shape of a _Yacht_ may be seen in the arms of\r\nRyde; while two Scottish families afford instances of the use of the _Ark_.\r\n\"Argent, an ark on the waters proper, surmounted of a dove azure, bearing\r\nin her beak an olive-branch vert,\" are the arms borne by Gellie of\r\nBlackford; and \"Argent, an ark in the sea proper, in chief a dove azure, in\r\nher beak a branch of olive of the second, within a bordure of the third\"\r\nare quoted as the arms of Primrose Gailliez of Chorleywood. Lastly, we may\r\nnote the appropriate use of a _Steamer_ in the arms of Barrow-in-Furness.\r\nThe curious figure of the lion dimidiated with the hulk of a ship which is\r\nmet with in the arms of several of the towns of the Cinque Ports has been\r\nreferred to on page 182.\r\n\r\n_Clouds_ form part of the arms of Leeson, which are: \"Gules, a chief nebuly\r\nargent, the rays of the sun issuing therefrom or.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Rainbow_ (Fig. 544), though not in itself a distinctly modern charge,\r\nfor it occurs in the crest of Hope, has been of late very frequently\r\ngranted as part of a crest. Instances occur in the crest of {295} the\r\nfamily of Pontifex, and again in that of Thurston, and of Wigan. Its use as\r\na part of a crest is to be deprecated, but in these days of complicated\r\narmory it might very advantageously be introduced as a charge upon a\r\nshield.\r\n\r\nAn unusual device, the _Thunderbolt_, is the crest of Carnegy. The arms of\r\nthe German family of Donnersperg very appropriately are: \"Sable, three\r\nthunderbolts or issuing from a chief nebuly argent, in base a mount of\r\nthree coupeaux of the second.\" The arms of the town of Blackpool furnish an\r\ninstance of a thunderbolt in dangerous conjunction with windmill sails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 545.--Estoile.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 546.--Mullet (Scottish star).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 547.--Mullet pierced (Scottish spur-revel).]\r\n\r\n_Stars_, a very common charge, may be instanced as borne under that name by\r\nthe Scottish shield of Alston. There has, owing to their similarity, been\r\nmuch confusion between _stars_, _estoiles_, _and mullets_. The difficulty\r\nis increased by the fact that no very definite lines have ever been\r\nfollowed officially. In England stars under that name are practically\r\nunknown. When the rays are wavy the charge is termed an estoile, but when\r\nthey are straight the term mullet is used. That being so, these rules\r\nfollow: that the estoile is never pierced (and from the accepted method of\r\ndepicting the estoile this would hardly seem very feasible), and that\r\nunless the number of points is specified there will be six (see Fig. 545).\r\nOther numbers are quite permissible, but the number of points (more usually\r\nin an estoile termed \"rays\") must be stated. The arm of Hobart, for\r\nexample, are: \"Sable, an estoile of eight rays or, between two flaunches\r\nermine.\" An estoile of sixteen rays is used by the town of Ilchester, but\r\nthe arms are not of any authority. Everything with straight points being in\r\nEngland a mullet, it naturally follows that the English practice permits a\r\nmullet to be plain (Fig. 546) or pierced (Fig. 547). Mullets are\r\noccasionally met with pierced of a colour other than the field they are\r\ncharged upon. According to the English practice, therefore, the mullet is\r\nnot represented as pierced unless it is expressly stated to be so. The\r\nmullet both in England and {296} Scotland is of five points unless a\r\ngreater number are specified. But mullets pierced and unpierced of six\r\n(Fig. 548) or eight points (Fig. 549) are frequent enough in English\r\narmory.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish practice differs, and it must be admitted that it is more\r\ncorrect than the English, though, strange to say, more complicated. In\r\nScottish armory they have the estoile, the star, and the mullet or the\r\nspur-revel. As to the estoile, of course, their practice is similar to the\r\nEnglish. But in Scotland a straight-pointed charge is a mullet if it be\r\npierced, and a star if it be not. As a mullet is really the \"molette\" or\r\nrowel of a spur, it certainly could not exist as a fact unpierced.\r\nNevertheless it is by no means stringently adhered to in that country, and\r\nthey make confusion worse confounded by the frequent use of the additional\r\nname of \"spur-rowel,\" or \"spur-revel\" for the pierced mullet. The mullet\r\noccurs in the arms of Vere, and was also the badge of that family. The part\r\nthis badge once played in history is well known. Had the De Veres worn\r\nanother badge on that fatal day the course of English history might have\r\nbeen changed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 548.--Mullet of six points.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 549.--Mullet of eight points.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 550.--Sun in splendour.]\r\n\r\nThe six-pointed mullet pierced occurs in the arms of De Clinton.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun in Splendour_--(Fig. 550) always so blazoned--is never represented\r\nwithout the surrounding rays, but the human face is not essential though\r\nusual to its heraldic use. The rays are alternately straight and wavy,\r\nindicative of the light and heat we derive therefrom, a typical piece of\r\ngenuine symbolism. It is a charge in the arms of Hurst, Pearson, and many\r\nother families; and a demi-sun issuing in base occurs in the arms of Davies\r\n(Plate VI.) and of Westworth. The coat of Warde-Aldam affords an example of\r\nthe _Rays_ of the sun alone.\r\n\r\nA Scottish coat, that of Baillie of Walstoun, has \"Azure, the moon in her\r\ncomplement, between nine mullets argent, three, two, three and one.\" The\r\nterm \"in her complement\" signifies that the moon is full, but with the moon\r\nno rays are shown, in this of course differing from the sun in splendour.\r\nThe face is usually represented in the full moon, {297} and sometimes in\r\nthe crescent moon, but the crescent moon must not be confused with the\r\nordinary heraldic crescent.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this class of charges, we may fitly do so by an allusion to\r\nthe shield of Sir William Herschel, with its appropriate though clumsy\r\ndevice of a _Telescope_.\r\n\r\nAs may be naturally expected, the insignia of sovereignty are of very\r\nfrequent occurrence in all armories, both English and foreign. Long before\r\nthe days of heraldry, some form of decoration for the head to indicate rank\r\nand power had been in vogue amongst, it is hardly too much to say, all\r\nnations on the earth. As in most things, Western nations have borrowed both\r\nideas, and added developments of those ideas, from the East, and in\r\ntraversing the range of armory, where crowns and coronets appear in modern\r\nWestern heraldry, we find a large proportion of these devices are\r\nstudiously and of purpose delineated as being _Eastern_.\r\n\r\nWith crowns and coronets as symbols of rank I am not now, of course,\r\nconcerned, but only with those cases which may be cited as supplying\r\nexamples where the different kinds of crowns appear either as charges on\r\nshields, or as forming parts of crests.\r\n\r\nCrowns, in heraldry, may be differentiated under the Royal or the Imperial,\r\nthe Eastern or antique, the Naval, and the Mural, which with the Crowns\r\nCelestial, Vallery and Palisado are all known as charges. Modern grants of\r\ncrowns of Eastern character in connection with valuable service performed\r\nin the East by the recipient may be instanced; _e.g._ by the Eastern Crown\r\nin the grant to Sir Abraham Roberts, G.C.B., the father of Field-Marshal\r\nEarl Roberts, K.G.\r\n\r\nIn order of antiquity one may best perhaps at the outset allude to the arms\r\nborne by the seaport towns of Boston, and of Kingston-on-Hull (or Hull, as\r\nthe town is usually called), inasmuch as a tradition has it that the three\r\ncrowns which figure on the shield of each of these towns originate from a\r\nrecognised device of merchantmen, who, travelling in and trading with the\r\nEast and likening themselves to the Magi, in their Bethlehem visit, adopted\r\nthese crowns as the device or badge of their business. The same remarks may\r\napply to the arms of Cologne: \"Argent, on a chief gules, three crowns or.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this fact (if the tradition be one) to the adoption of the same device\r\nby the towns to which these merchants traded is not a far step.\r\n\r\nOne may notice in passing that, unlike what from the legend one would\r\nexpect, these crowns are not of Eastern design, but of a class wholly\r\nconnected with heraldry itself. The legend and device, however, are both\r\nmuch older than these modern minutiæ of detail.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishopric of York has the well-known coat: \"Gules, two keys in\r\nsaltire argent, in chief a regal crown proper.\" {298}\r\n\r\nThe reputed arms of St. Etheldreda, who was both Queen, and also Abbess of\r\nEly, find their perpetuation in the arms of that See, which are: \"Gules,\r\nthree ducal (an early form of the Royal) crowns or;\" while the\r\nrecently-created See of St. Alban's affords an example of a celestial\r\ncrown: \"Azure, a saltire or, a sword in pale proper; in chief a celestial\r\ncrown of the second.\" The _Celestial Crown_ is to be observed in the arms\r\nof the borough of Kensington and as a part of the crest of Dunbar. The See\r\nof Bristol bears: \"Sable, three open crowns in pale or.\" The Royal or\r\nImperial Crown occurs in the crest of Eye, while an _Imperial Crown_ occurs\r\nin the crests of Robertson, Wolfe, and Lane.\r\n\r\nThe family of Douglas affords an instance of a crown ensigning a human\r\nheart. The arms of Toledo afford another case in point, being: \"Azure, a\r\nRoyal crown or\" (the cap being gules).\r\n\r\n_Antique Crowns_--as such--appear in the arms of Fraser and also in the\r\narms of Grant.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the Marquess of Ripon supplies an unusual variation, inasmuch\r\nas it issues from a coronet composed of fleurs-de-lis.\r\n\r\nThe other chief emblem of sovereignty--_the Sceptre_--is occasionally met\r\nwith, as in the Whitgreave crest of augmentation.\r\n\r\nThe Marquises of Mun bear the Imperial orb: \"Azure, an orb argent, banded,\r\nand surmounted by the cross or.\" The reason for the selection of this\r\nparticular charge in the grant of arms [Azure, on a fess or, a horse\r\ncourant gules, between three orbs gold, banded of the third] to Sir H. E.\r\nMoss, of the Empire Theatre in Edinburgh and the London Hippodrome, will be\r\nreadily guessed.\r\n\r\nUnder the classification of tools and implements the _Pick_ may be noted,\r\nthis being depicted in the arms of Mawdsley, Moseley, and Pigott, and a\r\npick and shovel in the arms of Hales.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Crawshay supply an instance of a _Plough_--a charge which also\r\noccurs in the arms of Waterlow and the crest of Provand, but is otherwise\r\nof very infrequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn English armory the use of _Scythes_, or, as they are sometimes termed,\r\n_Sneds_, is but occasional, though, as was only to be expected, this device\r\nappears in the Sneyd coat, as follows: \"Argent, a scythe, the blade in\r\nchief, the sned in bend sinister sable, in the fess point a fleur-de-lis of\r\nthe second.\" In Poland the Counts Jezierski bore: \"Gules, two scythe-blades\r\nin oval, the points crossing each other argent, and the ends in base tied\r\ntogether or, the whole surmounted in chief by a cross-patriarchal-patée, of\r\nwhich the lower arm on the sinister side is wanting.\"\r\n\r\nTwo sickles appear in the arms of Shearer, while the Hungerford crest in\r\nthe case of the Holdich-Hungerford family is blazoned: {299} \"Out of a\r\nducal coronet or, a pepper garb of the first between two sickles erect\r\nproper.\" The sickle was the badge of the Hungerfords.\r\n\r\nA _Balance_ forms one of the charges of the Scottish Corporation of the\r\nDean and Faculty of Advocates: \"Gules, a balance or, and a sword argent in\r\nsaltire, surmounted of an escutcheon of the second, charged with a lion\r\nrampant within a double tressure flory counterflory of the first,\" but it\r\nis a charge of infrequent appearance. It also figures in the arms of the\r\nInstitute of Chartered Accountants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 551.--Water-bouget.]\r\n\r\nBannerman of Elsick bears a _Banner_ for arms: \"Gules, a banner displayed\r\nargent and thereon on a canton azure a saltire argent as the badge of\r\nScotland.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 552.--Arms of Henry Bourchier, Earl of Essex, K.G.:\r\nQuarterly, 1 and 4, argent, a cross engrailed gules, between four\r\nwater-bougets sable (for Bourchier); 2 and 3, gules, billetté or, a fess\r\nargent (for Louvain). (From his seal.)]\r\n\r\n_Books_ are frequently made use of. The arms of Rylands, the family to\r\nwhose generosity Manchester owes the Rylands Library, afford a case in\r\npoint, and such charges occur in the arms of the Universities of both\r\nOxford and Cambridge, and in many other university and collegiate\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\n_Buckets_ and _Water-bougets_ (Fig. 551) can claim a wide use. In English\r\narmory Pemberton has three buckets, and water-bougets appear in the\r\nwell-known arms of Bourchier (Fig. 552). Water-bougets, which are really\r\nthe old form of water-bucket, were leather bags or bottles, two of which\r\nwere carried on a stick over the shoulder. The heraldic water-bouget\r\nrepresents the pair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 553.--Escallop.]\r\n\r\nFor an instance of the heraldic usage of the _Comb_ the case of the arms of\r\nPonsonby, Earls of Bessborough, may be cited. Combs also figure in the\r\ndelightfully punning Scottish coat for Rocheid.\r\n\r\nGenerally, however, when they do occur in heraldry they represent combs for\r\ncarding wool, as in the shield of Tunstall: \"Sable, three wool-combs\r\nargent,\" while the Russian Counts Anrep-Elmpt use: \"Or, a comb in bend\r\nazure, the teeth downwards.\"\r\n\r\n_Escallops_ (Fig. 553) rank as one of the most widely used heraldic charges\r\nin all countries. They figured in early days outside the limits of heraldry\r\nas the badge of pilgrims going to the Holy Land, and may {300} be seen on\r\nthe shields of many families at the period of the Crusades. Many other\r\nfamilies have adopted them, in the hope of a similar interpretation being\r\napplied to the appearance of them in their own arms. Indeed, so numerous\r\nare the cases in which they occur that a few representative ones must\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 554.--Arms of Hammersmith: Party per pale azure and\r\ngules, on a chevron between two cross crosslets in chief and an escallop in\r\nbase argent, three horseshoes of the first.

The Scottish family of Pringle, of Greenknowe, supplies an instance\r\nin: \"Azure, three escallops or within a bordure engrailed of the last;\"\r\nwhile the Irish Earls of Bandon bore: \"Argent, on a bend azure three\r\nescallops of the field.\" {301}\r\n\r\n_Hammers_ figure in the crests of Hammersmith (Fig. 554) and of Swindon\r\n(Plate VI.), and a hammer is held in the claw of the demi-dragon which is\r\nthe crest of Fox-Davies of Coalbrookdale, co. Salop (Plate VI.).\r\n\r\nA _Lantern_ is a charge on the shield of Cowper, and the arms of the town\r\nof Hove afford an absolutely unique instance of the use of _Leg-Irons_.\r\n\r\nThree towns--Eccles, Bootle, and Ramsgate--supply cases in their arms in\r\nwhich a _Lighthouse_ is depicted, and this charge would appear, so far as\r\ncan be ascertained, not only to be restricted to English armory, but to the\r\nthree towns now named.\r\n\r\n_Locomotives_ appear in the arms of Swindon (Plate VI.) and the Great\r\nCentral Railway (Fig. 555).\r\n\r\nOf a similar industrial character is the curious coat of arms granted at\r\nhis express wish to the late Mr. Samson Fox of Leeds and Harrogate, which\r\ncontains a representation of the _Corrugated Boiler-Flue_ which formed the\r\nbasis of his fortune.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 556.--Catherine wheel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 557.--Staple.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 558.--Hawk's Lure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 559.--Fylfot.]\r\n\r\nAn instance of the use of a _Sand-Glass_ occurs in the arms of the Scottish\r\nfamily of Joass of Collinwort, which are thus blazoned: \"Vert, a sand-glass\r\nrunning argent, and in chief the Holy Bible expanded proper.\"\r\n\r\nA Scottish corporation, too, supplies a somewhat unusual charge, that of\r\n_Scissors_: \"Azure, a pair of scissors or\" (Incorporation of Tailors of\r\nAberdeen); though a Swabian family (by name Jungingen) has for its arms:\r\n\"Azure, a pair of scissors open, blades upwards argent.\"\r\n\r\n_Barrels_ and _Casks_, which in heraldry are always known as _tuns_,\r\nnaturally figure in many shields where the name lends itself to a pun, as\r\nin the arms of Bolton.\r\n\r\n_Wheels_ occur in the shields of Turner [\"Argent, gutté-de-sang, a {302}\r\nwheel of eight spokes sable, on a chief wavy azure, a dolphin naiant of the\r\nfirst\"] and Carter, and also in the arms of Gooch. The _Catherine Wheel_\r\n(Fig. 556), however, is the most usual heraldic form. The _Staple_ (Fig.\r\n557) and the _Hawk's Lure_ (Fig. 558) deserve mention, and I will wind up\r\nthe list of examples with the _Fylfot_ (Fig. 559), which no one knows the\r\nmeaning or origin of.\r\n\r\nThe list of heraldic charges is very far, indeed, from being exhausted. The\r\nforegoing must, however, suffice; but those who are curious to pursue this\r\nbranch of the subject further should examine the arms, both ancient and\r\nmodern, of towns and trade corporations. {303}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE HERALDIC HELMET\r\n\r\nSince one's earliest lessons in the rules of heraldry, we have been taught,\r\nas one of the fundamental laws of the achievement, that the helmet by its\r\nshape and position is indicative of rank; and we early learnt by rote that\r\nthe esquire's helmet was of steel, and was placed in profile, with the\r\nvisor closed: the helmet of the knight and baronet was to be open and\r\naffronté; that the helmet of the peer must be of silver, guarded by grilles\r\nand placed in profile; and that the royal helmet was of gold, with grilles,\r\nand affronté. Until recent years certain stereotyped forms of the helmet\r\nfor these varying circumstances were in use, hideous alike both in the\r\nregularity of their usage and the atrocious shapes into which they had been\r\nevolved. These regulations, like some other adjuncts of heraldic art, are\r\ncomparatively speaking of modern origin. Heraldry in its earlier and better\r\ndays knew them not, and they came into vogue about the Stuart times, when\r\nheraldic art was distinctly on the wane. It is puzzling to conceive a\r\ndesire to stereotype these particular forms, and we take it that the fact,\r\nwhich is undoubted, arose from the lack of heraldic knowledge on the part\r\nof the artists, who, having one form before them, which they were assured\r\nwas correct, under the circumstances simply reproduced this particular form\r\nin facsimile time after time, not knowing how far they might deviate and\r\nstill remain correct. The knowledge of heraldry by the heraldic artist was\r\nthe real point underlying the excellence of mediæval heraldic art, and\r\nunderlying the excellence of much of the heraldic art in the revival of the\r\nlast few years. As it has been often pointed out, in olden times they\r\n\"played\" with heraldry, and therein lay the excellence of that period. The\r\nold men knew the lines within which they could \"play,\" and knew the laws\r\nwhich they could not transgress. Their successors, ignorant of the laws of\r\narms, and afraid of the hidden meanings of armory, had none but the\r\nstereotyped lines to follow. The result was bad. Let us first consider the\r\ndevelopment of the actual helmet, and then its application to heraldic\r\npurposes will be more readily followed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 560.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 561.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 562.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 563.]\r\n\r\nTo the modern mind, which grumbles at the weight of present-day {304} head\r\ncoverings, it is often a matter of great wonder how the knights of ancient\r\ndays managed to put up with the heavy weight of the great iron helmet, with\r\nits wooden or leather crest. A careful study of ancient descriptions of\r\ntournaments and warfare will supply the clue to the explanation, which is\r\nsimply that the helmet was very seldom worn. For ceremonial purposes and\r\noccasions it was carried by a page, and in actual use it was carried slung\r\nat the saddle-bow, until the last moment, when it was donned for action as\r\nblows and close contact became imminent. Then, by the nature of its\r\nconstruction, the weight was carried by the shoulders, the head and neck\r\nmoving freely within necessary limits inside. All this will be more readily\r\napparent, when the helmet itself is considered. Our present-day ideas of\r\nhelmets--their shape, their size, and their proportions--are largely taken\r\nfrom the specimens manufactured (not necessarily in modern times) for\r\nceremonial purposes; _e.g._ for exhibition as insignia of knighthood. By\r\nfar the larger proportion of the genuine helmets now to be seen were\r\npurposely made (certainly at remote dates) not for actual use in battle or\r\ntournament, but for ceremonial use, chiefly at funerals. Few, indeed, are\r\nthe examples still existing of helmets which have been actually used in\r\nbattle or tournament. Why there are so few remaining to us, when every\r\nperson of position must necessarily have possessed one throughout the\r\nPlantagenet period, and probably at any rate to the end of the reign of\r\nHenry VII., is a mystery which has puzzled many people--for helmets are\r\nnot, like glass and china, subject to the vicissitudes of breakage. The\r\nreason is doubtless to be found in the fact that at that period they were\r\nso general, and so little out of the common, that they possessed no greater\r\nvalue than any other article of clothing; and whilst the real helmet,\r\nlacking a ceremonial value, was not preserved, the sham ceremonial helmet\r\nof a later period, possessing none but a ceremonial value, was preserved\r\nfrom ceremonial to ceremonial, and has been passed on to the present day.\r\nBut a glance at so many of these helmets which exist will plainly show that\r\nit was quite impossible for any man's head to have gone inside them, and\r\nthe sculptured helmets of what may seem to us uncouth shape and exaggerated\r\nsize, which are occasionally to be found as part of a monumental effigy,\r\nare the size and shape of the helmets that were worn in battle. This\r\naccounts for the much larger-sized helmets in proportion to the size of\r\nshield which will be found in heraldic emblazonments of the Plantagenet and\r\nTudor periods. The artists of those periods were accustomed to the sight of\r\nreal helmets, and knew and drew the real proportion which existed between\r\nthe fighting helmet and the fighting shield. Artists of Stuart and Georgian\r\ndays knew only the ceremonial helmet, and consequently adopted and\r\nstereotyped its impossible shape, {305} and equally impossible size.\r\nVictorian heraldic artists, ignorant alike of the actual and the\r\nceremonial, reduced the size even further, and until the recent revulsion\r\nin heraldic art, with its reversion to older types, and its copying of\r\nolder examples, the helmets of heraldry had reached the uttermost limits of\r\nabsurdity.\r\n\r\nThe recent revival of heraldry is due to men with accurate and extensive\r\nknowledge, and many recent examples of heraldic art well compare with\r\nancient types. One happy result of this revival is a return to older and\r\nbetter types of the helmet. But it is little use discarding the \"heraldic\"\r\nhelmet of the stationer's shop unless a better and more accurate result can\r\nbe shown, so that it will be well to trace in detail the progress of the\r\nreal helmet from earliest times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 564.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 565.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 566.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 567.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 568.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 569.--Painted \"Pot-Helmet,\" _c._ 1241.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 570.--\"Pot-Helmet,\" from the _Eneit_ of Heinrich von\r\nVeldeke.]\r\n\r\nIn the Anglo-Saxon period the common helmet was merely a cap of leather,\r\noften four-cornered, and with a serrated comb (Figs. 560 and 561), but men\r\nof rank had a conical one of metal (Fig. 562), which was frequently richly\r\ngilt. About the time of Edward the Confessor a small piece, of varying\r\nbreadth, called a \"nasal,\" was added (Fig. 563), which, with a quilted or\r\ngamboised hood, or one of mail, well protected the face, leaving little\r\nmore than the eyes exposed; and in this form the helmet continued in\r\ngeneral use until towards the end of the twelfth century, when we find it\r\nmerged into or supplanted by the {306} \"chapelle-de-fer,\" which is first\r\nmentioned in documents at this period, and was shaped like a flat-topped,\r\ncylindrical cap. This, however, was soon enlarged so as to cover the whole\r\nhead (Fig. 564), an opening being left for the features, which were\r\nsometimes protected by a movable \"ventaille,\" or a visor, instead of the\r\n\"nasal.\" This helmet (which was adopted by Richard I., who is also\r\nsometimes represented with a conical one) was the earliest form of the\r\nlarge war and tilting \"heaume\" (or helm), which was of great weight and\r\nstrength, and often had only small openings or slits for the eyes (Figs.\r\n565 and 566). These eyepieces were either one wide slit or two, one on\r\neither side. The former was, however, sometimes divided into two by an\r\nornamental bar or buckle placed across. It was afterwards pointed at the\r\ntop, and otherwise slightly varied in shape, but its general form appears\r\nto have been the same until the end of the fourteenth century (Figs. 567,\r\n568). This type of helmet is usually known as the \"pot-shaped.\" The helmets\r\nthemselves were sometimes painted, and Fig. 569 represents an instance\r\nwhich is painted in green and white diagonal stripes. The illustration is\r\nfrom a parchment MS. of about 1241 now in the Town Library of Leipzic. Fig.\r\n570 shows another German example of this type, being taken from the _Eneit_\r\nof Heinrich von Veldeke, a MS. now in the Royal Library in Berlin,\r\nbelonging to the end of the twelfth century. The crest depicted in this\r\ncase, a red lion, must be one of the earliest instances of a crest. These\r\n{307} are the helmets which we find on early seals and effigies, as will be\r\nseen from Figs. 571-574.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 571.--Helmet of Hamelin, Earl of Surrey and Warenne (d.\r\n1202). (From MS. Cott., Julius, C. vii.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 572.--From the seal of Richard de Clare, Earl of\r\nGloucester and Hertford (d. 1262).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 573.--From the seal of John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey\r\n(d. 1305).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 574.--From the seal (1315) of John de Bretagne, Earl of\r\nRichmond.]\r\n\r\nThe cylindrical or \"pot-shaped\" helmet of the Plantagenets, however,\r\ndisappears in the latter part of the thirteenth century, when we first find\r\nmention of the \"bascinet\" (from Old French for a basin), Figs. 575-579.\r\nThis was at first merely a hemispherical steel cap, put over the coif of\r\nmail to protect the top of the head, when the knight wished to be relieved\r\nfrom the weight of his large helm (which he then slung at his back or\r\ncarried on his saddlebow), but still did not consider the mail coif\r\nsufficient protection. It soon became pointed at the top, and gradually\r\nlower at the back, though not so much as to protect the neck. In the\r\nfourteenth century the mail, instead of being carried over the top of the\r\nhead, was hung to the bottom rim of the helmet, and {308} spread out over\r\nthe shoulders, overlapping the cuirass. This was called the \"camail,\" or\r\n\"curtain of mail.\" It is shown in Figs. 576 and 577 fastened to the\r\nbascinet by a lace or thong passing through staples.\r\n\r\nThe large helm, which throughout the fourteenth century was still worn over\r\nthe bascinet, did not fit down closely to the cuirass (though it may have\r\nbeen fastened to it with a leather strap), its bottom curve not being\r\nsufficiently arched for that purpose; nor did it wholly rest on the\r\nshoulders, but was probably wadded inside so as to fit closely to the\r\nbascinet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 575.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 576.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 577.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 578.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 579.]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if any actual helm previous to the fourteenth century\r\nexists, and there are very few of that period remaining. In that of the\r\nBlack Prince at Canterbury (Fig. 271) the lower, or cylindrical, portion is\r\ncomposed of a front and back piece, riveted together at the sides, and this\r\nwas most likely the usual form of construction; but in the helm of Sir\r\nRichard Pembridge (Figs. 580 and 581) the three pieces (cylinder, conical\r\npiece, and top piece) of which it is formed are fixed with nails, and are\r\nso welded together that no trace of a join is visible. The edges of the\r\nmetal, turned outwards round the ocularium, are very thick, and the bottom\r\nedge is rolled inwards over a thick wire, so as not to cut the surcoat.\r\nThere are many twin holes in the helmet for the aiglets, by which the crest\r\nand lambrequin were attached, and in front, near the bottom, are two +\r\nshaped holes for the T bolt, which was fixed by a chain to the cuirass.\r\n\r\nThe helm of Sir Richard Hawberk (Figs. 582 and 583), who died in 1417, is\r\nmade of five pieces, and is very thick and heavy. It is much more like the\r\nlater form adapted for jousting, and was probably only for use in the\r\ntilt-yard; but, although more firmly fixed to the cuirass than the earlier\r\nhelm, it did not fit closely down to it, as all later helms did.\r\n\r\nSingularly few examples of the pot-helmet actually exist. The \"Linz\"\r\nexample (Figs. 584 and 585), which is now in the {309} Francisco-Carolinum\r\nMuseum at Linz, was dredged out of the Traun, and is unfortunately very\r\nmuch corroded by rust. The fastening-place for the crest, however, is well\r\npreserved. The example belongs to the first half of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 580.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 581.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 582.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 583.]\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"Pranker-Helm\" (Fig. 586), from the chapter of Seckau, now in\r\nthe collection of armour in the Historical Court Museum at Vienna, and\r\nbelonging to the middle of the fourteenth century, could only have been\r\nused for tournaments. It is made of four strong hammered sheets of iron 1-2\r\nmillimetres thick, with other strengthening plates laid on. The helmet by\r\nitself weighs 5 kilogrammes 357 grammes. {310}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 584 and 585.--The \"Linz\" Pot-Helmet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 587.]\r\n\r\nThe custom of wearing the large helm over the bascinet being clumsy and\r\ntroublesome, many kinds of visor were invented, so as to dispense with the\r\nlarge helm, except for jousting, two of which are represented in Figs. 575\r\nand 579. In the first a plate shaped somewhat to the nose was attached to\r\nthe part of the camail which covered the mouth. This plate, and the mail\r\nmouth-guard, when not in use, hung downwards towards the breast; but when\r\nin use it was drawn up and attached to a staple or locket on the front of\r\nthe bascinet. This fashion, however, does not appear to have been adopted\r\nin England, but was peculiar to Germany, Austria, &c. None of these\r\ncontrivances seem to have been very satisfactory, but towards the end of\r\nthe fourteenth century the large and salient beaked visor was invented\r\n(Fig. 587). It was fixed to hinges at the sides of the bascinet with pins,\r\nand was removable at will. A high collar of steel was next added as a\r\nsubstitute for the camail. This form of helmet remained in use during the\r\nfirst half of the fifteenth century, and the large helm, which was only\r\nused for jousting, took a different form, or rather several different\r\nforms, which may be divided into three kinds. In this connection it should\r\nbe remembered that the heavy jousting helmet to which the crest had\r\nrelation was probably never used in actual warfare. The first was called a\r\nbascinet, and was used for combats on foot. It had an almost spherical\r\ncrown-piece, and came right down to the cuirass, to which it was firmly\r\nfixed, and was, like all large helms of the fifteenth century, large enough\r\nfor the wearer to move his head about freely inside. The helm of Sir Giles\r\nCapel (Fig. 588) is a good specimen of this class; it has a visor of great\r\nthickness, in which are a great number of holes, thus enabling the wearer\r\nto see in every direction. The \"barbute,\" or ovoid bascinet, with a\r\nchin-piece riveted to it, was somewhat like this helm, and is often seen on\r\nthe brasses of {311} 1430-1450; the chin-piece retaining the name of\r\n\"barbute,\" after the bascinet had gone out of fashion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 586.--Pranker-Helm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 591.--German Tilting Armour, 1480, from the Collection\r\nin the Museum at Vienna.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 592.--Tilting-Helmet of Sir John Gostwick, 1541.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 588.]\r\n\r\nThe second kind of large helm used in the fifteenth century was the\r\n\"jousting-helm,\" which was of great strength, and firmly fixed to the\r\ncuirass. One from the Brocas Collection (Figs. 589 and 590, date about\r\n1500) is perhaps the grandest helm in existence. It is formed of three\r\npieces of different thicknesses (the front piece being the thickest), which\r\nare fixed together with strong iron rivets with salient heads and thin\r\nbrass caps soldered to them. The arrangements for fixing it in front and\r\nbehind are very complete and curious.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the helmet was connected with the rest of the armour is\r\nshown in Fig. 591, which is a representation of a German suit of tilting\r\narmour of the period about 1480, now in the collection of armour at the\r\nRoyal Museum in Vienna.\r\n\r\nOf the same character, but of a somewhat different shape, is the helmet\r\n(Fig. 592) of Sir John Gostwick, who died in 1541, which is now in\r\nWillington Church, Bedfordshire. The illustration here given is taken from\r\nthe _Portfolio_, No. 33. The visor opening on the right side of the helmet\r\nis evidently taken from an Italian model.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 589.]\r\n\r\nThe third and last kind of helm was the \"tournament helm,\" and was similar\r\nto the first kind, and also called a \"bascinet\"; but the visor was\r\ngenerally barred, or, instead of a movable visor, the bars were riveted on\r\nthe helm, and sometimes the face was only protected by a sort of wire-work,\r\nlike a fencing-mask. It was only used for the tourney or mêlée, when the\r\nweapons were the sword and mace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 590.]\r\n\r\nThe \"chapelle-de-fer,\" which was in use in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and\r\nfifteenth centuries, was a light iron head-piece, with a broad, flat brim,\r\nsomewhat turned down. Fig. 593 represents one belonging to the {312} end of\r\nthe fifteenth century, which is one of the few remaining, and is delicately\r\nforged in one piece of thin, hard steel.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth century a new kind of helmet arose, called in England\r\nthe \"sallad,\" or \"sallet.\" The word appears to have two derivations, each\r\nof which was applied to a different form of head-piece. First, the Italian\r\n\"celata\" (Fig. 594), which seems originally to have been a modification of\r\nthe bascinet. Second, the German \"schallern,\" the form of which was\r\nprobably suggested by the chapelle-de-fer. Both of these were called by the\r\nFrench \"salade,\" whence our English \"sallad.\" The celata came lower down\r\nthan the bascinet, protected the back and sides of the neck, and, closing\r\nround the cheeks, often left only the eyes, nose, and mouth exposed. A\r\nstandard of mail protected the neck if required. In the fifteenth century\r\nthe celata ceased to be pointed at the summit, and was curved outwards at\r\nthe nape of the neck, as in Fig. 595.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 593.]\r\n\r\nThe \"schallern\" (from _shale_, a shell, or bowl), was really a helmet and\r\nvisor in one piece; it had a slit for the eyes, a projecting brim, and a\r\nlong tail, and was completed by a chin-piece, or \"bavier\" (Eng. \"beaver\"),\r\nwhich was strapped round the neck. Fig. 596 shows a German sallad and a\r\nSpanish beaver. The sallad was much used in the fifteenth century, during\r\nthe latter half of which it often had a visor, as in one from Rhodes (Fig.\r\n597), which has a spring catch on the right side to hold the visor in place\r\nwhen down. The rivets for its lining-cap have large, hollow, twisted heads,\r\nwhich are seldom found on existing sallads, though often seen in sculpture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 594.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 595.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 596.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 597.]\r\n\r\nThe schale, schallern (_schêlern_), or sallad, either with or without a\r\n{313} visor, is very seldom seen in heraldic use. An instance, however, in\r\nwhich it has been made use of heraldically will be found in Fig. 598, which\r\nis from a pen and ink drawing in the _Fest-Buch_ of Paulus Kel, a MS. now\r\nin the Royal Library at Munich. This shows the schallern with the slit for\r\nseeing through, and the fixed neck-guard. The \"bart,\" \"bavière,\" or beaver,\r\nfor the protection of the under part of the face, is also visible. It is\r\nnot joined to the helmet. The helmet bears the crest of Bavaria, the\r\nred-crowned golden lion of the Palatinate within the wings of the curiously\r\ndisposed Bavarian tinctures. Fig. 599 (p. 316) is a very good\r\nrepresentation of a schallern dating from the latter part of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, with a sliding neck-guard. It is reproduced from the _Deutscher\r\nHerold_, 1892, No. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 598.--Schallern, with Crest of Bavaria (Duke Ludwig of\r\nBavaria, 1449).]\r\n\r\nUntil almost the middle of the fifteenth century all helmets fitted on the\r\ntop of the head, or were put right over; but about 1440 the Italians made a\r\ngreat improvement by inventing the \"armet,\" the lower part of which opened\r\nout with hinges, so that when put on it enclosed the head, fitting closely\r\nround the lower part of it, while its weight was borne by the steel collar,\r\nor \"gorget.\" The Italian armet had a roundel or disc to protect the opening\r\nat the back of the neck, and a bavier strapped on in front to cover the\r\njoining of the two {314} cheek-pieces. The earlier armets, like the beaked\r\nbascinet, had a camail attached by a row of staples (Fig. 600), which was\r\ncontinued later, but then fixed either to a metal band or leather strap and\r\nriveted to the base of the armet. This form of helmet was not in common use\r\nin England until about 1500.\r\n\r\nFig. 600 shows the earliest form of Italian armet, with a reinforcing-piece\r\non the forehead, and a removable visor. Date 1450-1480. Fig. 601 represents\r\nan armet of very fine form (probably Italian), which is a nearer approach\r\nto the close-helmet of the sixteenth century, as the visor cannot be\r\nremoved, and the eye-slit is in the visor, instead of being formed by the\r\nspace between it and the crown-piece, and there is also no\r\nreinforcing-piece in the crown. Date 1480-1500. Fig. 602 is still more like\r\nthe sixteenth-century helmet, for it opens down the sides instead of down\r\nthe chin and back, and the same pivot which secures the visor also serves\r\nas a hinge for the crown and chin-piece. The small mentonnière, or bavier,\r\nis equal on both sides, but it was often of less extent on the right. Date\r\nabout 1500.\r\n\r\nFig. 603 shows a German fluted helmet, of magnificent form and workmanship,\r\nwhich is partly engraved and gilded. Date 1510-1525. It opens down the\r\nchin, like the early armets, but the tail-piece of the crown is much\r\nbroader. The skill shown in the forging of the crown and the fluting of the\r\ntwisted comb is most remarkable, and each rivet for the lining-strap of the\r\ncheek-pieces forms the centre of an engraved six-leaved rose. A grooved rim\r\nround the bottom of the helmet fitted closely on a salient rim at the top\r\nof the steel gorget or hause col, so that when placed on its gorget and\r\nclosed, it could not be wrenched off, but could yet be moved round freely\r\nin a horizontal direction. The gorget being articulated, the head could\r\nalso be raised or lowered a little, but not enough to make this form of\r\njoint very desirable, and a looser kind was soon substituted.\r\n\r\nFig. 604 shows what is perhaps the most perfect type of close helmet. The\r\ncomb is much larger than was the custom at an earlier date, and much\r\nresembles those of the morions of this period. The visor is formed of two\r\nseparate parts; the upper fits inside the lower, and could be raised to\r\nfacilitate seeing without unfixing the lower portion. It is engraved with\r\narabesques, and is probably Italian. Date 1550-1570. Fig. 605 is an English\r\nhelmet, half-way between a close helmet and a \"burgonet.\" It is really a\r\n\"casque,\" with cheek-pieces to meet in front. The crown-piece is joined\r\ndown the middle of the comb. This helmet was probably made for the Earl of\r\nLeicester. Date about 1590.\r\n\r\nThe word \"burgonet\" first appeared about the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and described a form of helmet like the \"celata,\" and {315} called\r\nby that name in Italy. It was completed by a \"buffe,\" or chin-piece,\r\nsimilar to the bavier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 600.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 601.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 602.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 603.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 604.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 605.]\r\n\r\nDuring this century the \"morion,\" really an improved \"chapelle-de-fer,\" was\r\nmuch in use. It had a curved top, surmounted by a comb, and a broad,\r\nturned-up brim, and was often elaborately engraved and gilt. The \"cabasset\"\r\nwas a similar head-piece, but had a peaked top, surmounted by a small spike\r\nturned backwards, and generally a flatter, narrower brim than the morion.\r\nThese three forms of helmet were all called casques.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 606.--\"Grid-iron\" Helmet (fifteenth century).]\r\n\r\nThe barred or grilled helmet owed its introduction to tournaments with\r\nswords and clubs, which necessitated better opportunities of vision than\r\nthe earlier tilting-helm afforded, sufficient though that was for\r\nencounters with the tilting-spear. The earliest form of this type of helmet\r\nwill be seen in Fig. 606, which is termed a \"grid-iron\" helmet, developing\r\nshortly afterwards into the form of Fig. 607, which has a lattice-work\r\nvisor. The former figure, the \"grid-iron\" helmet, is a {316} representation\r\ntaken from an original now in the possession of Count Hans Wilczek, of\r\nVienna. Fig. 607, the helmet with the latticed visor, is from an example in\r\nthe German National Museum at Nürnberg. Neither of these types of helmet\r\nappears to have been regularly adopted into heraldic art. Indeed they are\r\nseldom, if ever, to be found in heraldic emblazonment. For pictorial and\r\nartistic purposes they seem to be entirely supplanted in paintings, in\r\nseals, and in sculpture by the \"grilled\" helmet or \"buckler.\" Whether this\r\nhelmet, as we find it depicted in paintings or on seals, was ever really\r\nworn in battle or tournament seems very doubtful, and no actual instance\r\nappears to have been preserved. On the other hand, the so-called\r\n\"Prankhelme\" (pageant helmet) bucklers, frequently made of gilded leather\r\nand other materials, are extant in some number. It is evident from their\r\nnature, however, that they can only have been used for ceremonial or\r\ndecorative purposes.\r\n\r\nFig. 608 shows one of these buckled \"pageant\" helmets surmounted by the\r\ncrest of the Margraviate of Burgau. Fig. 609 shows another of these pageant\r\nhelmets, with the crest of Austria (ancient) or of Tyrol. These were borne,\r\nwith many others of the same character, in the pageant of the funeral\r\nprocession of the Emperor Frederick III. (IV.) in 1493. The helmets were\r\nmade of leather, and gilded, the two crests being carved out of boards and\r\npainted. The Burgau wings, which are inclined very far forward, are: \"Bendy\r\nof six argent and gules, charged with a pale or.\" In their normal position\r\nthe wings are borne upright. The second crest, which is 86 cm. in height,\r\nis black, and adorned on the outside with eared pegs 4 cm. long, from which\r\ngold linden-leaves hang. These helmets and crests, which were formerly in\r\nSt. Stephen's Cathedral, are now in the Vienna Historical Museum.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century the workmanship became\r\ninferior, and beauty of line was no longer sought after. Shortly afterwards\r\nhelmets ceased to be worn outside the regular army, and with the subsequent\r\nevolution of military head coverings heraldry has no concern.\r\n\r\nAs a part of a heraldic achievement the helmet is not so old as the shield.\r\nIt was not until the introduction of the crest that any one thought of\r\ndepicting a helmet with a shield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 599.--Schallern (end of fifteenth century).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 607.--Helmet, with Latticed Visor (end of fifteenth\r\ncentury).]\r\n\r\nA careful and attentive examination of the early \"Rolls of Arms,\" and of\r\nseals and other ancient examples of heraldic art and handicraft, will at\r\nonce make it plainly apparent that the helmets then heraldically depicted\r\nwere in close keeping and of the style actually in use for warfare, joust,\r\nor tournament at the period. This is particularly noticeable in the helmets\r\non the stall plates of the Knights of the Garter in St. George's Chapel at\r\nWindsor. The helms on the early {317} stall plates, though far from being\r\nidentical in shape, all appear to be of the same class or type of\r\ntilting-helm drawn in profile. Amongst the early plates only one instance\r\n(Richard, Duke of Gloucester, elected 1475) can be found of the barred\r\nhelmet. This is the period when helmets actually existed in fact, and were\r\nactually used, but at the end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth centuries, when the helmet was being fast relegated to\r\nceremonial usage and pictorial emblazonment, ingenious heralds began to\r\nevolve the system by which rank and degree were indicated by the helmet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 608.--Pageant Helmet, with the Crest of Burgau.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 609.--Pageant Helmet, with the Crest of Austria\r\n(ancient) or Tyrol.]\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to consider British rules concerning the heraldic helmet,\r\nit may be well to note those which have been accepted abroad. In Germany\r\nheraldry has known but two classes of helmet, the open helmet guarded by\r\nbars (otherwise buckles or grilles), and the closed {318} or \"visored\"\r\nhelmet. The latter was the helmet used by the newly ennobled, the former by\r\nthe older families of higher position, it being originally held that only\r\nthose families whose birth qualified them to tilt were permitted to use\r\nthis buckled helmet. Tournaments were of course always conducted on very\r\nstrict lines. Woodward reprints in his \"Treatise on Heraldry\" the \"Tourney\r\nRegulations for the Exposure of Arms and Crest, drawn up by René, Duke of\r\nAnjou, King of Sicily and Jerusalem,\" from Menêtrier's _L'Origin des\r\nArmoiries_. The rules to be complied with are there set out. Fig. 12 herein\r\nis a representation of a \"Helmschau,\" where the examination of the crests\r\nis being carried on. It is interesting to notice therein that the whole of\r\nthe helmets without exception have the grilles. Germany was perhaps the\r\nearliest country to fall from grace in the matter, for towards the end of\r\nthe fifteenth century the buckled helmet is found with the arms of the\r\nlower Briefadels (those ennobled by patent), and the practice continued\r\ndespite the violent protests of the tournament families, who considered\r\ntheir prerogative had been infringed. The closed helmet consequently sank\r\ngradually in Germany to the grade of a mere burgess's helmet, and as such\r\nbecame of little account, although in former times it had been borne by the\r\nproudest houses.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in France the \"buckled\" helmet was considered to be reserved for\r\nthe military noblesse, and newly ennobled families were denied its use\r\nuntil the third generation, when they became _bons gentilhommes_. Woodward\r\nstates that when \"in 1372 Charles V. conferred on the bourgeoisie of Paris\r\nthe right to use armorial bearings, it was strenuously denied that they\r\ncould use the timbred helm. In 1568 an edict of Charles IX. prohibited the\r\nuse of _armoiries timbrées_ to any who were not noble by birth.\" The\r\ngrilles of the helmet produced with the old French heralds the opportunity\r\nof a minutiæ of rule which, considering the multitude of rules fathered,\r\nrightly or wrongly, upon British heraldry, we may be devoutly happy never\r\nreached our shores. They assigned different numbers of grilles to different\r\nranks, but as the writers differ as to the varying numbers, it is probable\r\nthat such rules were never officially accepted even in that country. In\r\nFrance the rule was much as in this country, a gold helmet for the\r\nSovereign, silver for princes and great nobles, steel for the remainder. It\r\nis curious that though the timbred helm was of course known in England\r\nwhilst the controversy as to its heraldic use was raging in France and\r\nGermany, no heraldic use of it whatever occurs till the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century. From Royalty to the humblest gentleman, all used for\r\nheraldic purposes the closed or visored helms.\r\n\r\nThe present rules concerning helmets which hold in Great Britain are that\r\nthe helmet of the Sovereign and the Royal princes of this {319} country\r\nshall be of gold, placed in an affronté position, and shall have grilles.\r\nThe helmet of a peer shall be of silver, shall be placed in profile, and\r\nshall have golden grilles, frequently stated to be five in number, a detail\r\nnot stringently adhered to. The helmet of a knight or baronet shall be of\r\nsteel, placed full-faced, and shall be open; whilst the helmet of an\r\nesquire or gentleman shall be of steel and in profile, with the visor\r\nclosed. Within these limits considerable latitude is allowed, and even in\r\nofficial grants of arms, which, as far as emblazonment goes, are very much\r\nof a stereotyped style, actual unvarying adherence to a particular pattern\r\nis not insisted upon.\r\n\r\nThe earliest instance amongst the Garter plates in which a helmet with\r\ngrilles is used to denote the rank of a peer is the stall plate of Lord\r\nKnollys in 1615. In the Visitations but few instances can be found in which\r\nthe arms of peers are included. Peers were not compelled to attend and\r\nenter their arms and pedigrees at Visitations, doubtless owing to the fact\r\nthat no Garter King of Arms ever made a Visitation, whilst it has been the\r\nlong-asserted prerogative of Garter to deal with peers and their arms by\r\nhimself. At the same time, however, there are some number of instances of\r\npeers' arms and pedigrees in the Visitation Books, several occurring in the\r\n1587 Visitation of Yorkshire. In these cases the arms of peers are set out\r\nwith supporters and mottoes, but there is no difference between their\r\nhelmets and what we should now term the helmet of an esquire or gentleman.\r\nThis is all the more curious because neither helmet nor motto is found in\r\nthe tricks given of the arms of commoners. Consequently one may with\r\ncertainty date the introduction of the helmet with grilles as the\r\ndistinguishing mark of a peer in this country between the years 1587 and\r\n1615. The introduction of the open full-faced helmet as indicative of\r\nknight or baronet is known to date from about the period of the\r\nRestoration.\r\n\r\nWhilst these fixed rules as to helmets are still scrupulously adhered to by\r\nEnglish heralds, Lyon King of Arms would seem to be inclined to let them\r\nquietly lapse into desuetude, and the emblazonment of the arms of Sir\r\nGeorge Duff-Sutherland-Dunbar, Bart., in the Lyon Register at the recent\r\nrematriculation of his arms, affords an instance in which the rules have\r\nbeen ignored.\r\n\r\nSome of the objections one hears raised to official heraldry will not hold\r\nwater when all facts are known; but one certainly thinks that those who\r\nobject to the present helmet and its methods of usage have ample reason for\r\nsuch remarks as one frequently sees in print upon the subject. To put it\r\nmildly, it is absolutely ridiculous to see a helmet placed affronté, and a\r\nlion passant looking out over the side of it; or to see a helmet in profile\r\nwith the crest of a man's head {320} affronté placed above it, and as a\r\nconsequence also peeping over the side. The necessity for providing a\r\nresting-place for the crest other than unoccupied space has also led to the\r\nridiculous practice of depicting the wreath or torse in the form of a\r\nstraight bar balanced upon the apex of the helmet. The rule itself as to\r\nthe positions of helmets for the varying ranks is officially recognised,\r\nand the elaboration of the rule with regard to the differing metals of the\r\nRoyal helmet and the helmets of peers and knights and baronets is\r\nofficially followed; though the supposed regulation, which requires that\r\nthe helmet of an esquire or gentleman shall be of steel alone is not,\r\ninasmuch as the helmet painted upon a grant is _always_ ornamented with\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nThese rules in England only date from the times of the Stuarts, and they\r\ncannot be said to be advantageous from any point of view; they are\r\ncertainly distinctly harmful from the artistic standpoint. It is plainly\r\nutterly impossible to depict some crests upon a profile helmet, and equally\r\nimpossible to display others upon an affronté helmet. In Scotland the\r\ncrests do not afford quite such a regular succession of glaring examples\r\nfor ridicule as is the case in England. No need is recognised in Scotland\r\nfor necessarily distinguishing the crest of one family from that of\r\nanother, though proper differences are rigidly adhered to with regard to\r\nthe coats of arms. Nevertheless, Scotland provides us with many crests\r\nwhich it is utterly impossible to actually carry on an actual helmet, and\r\nexamples of this kind can be found in the rainbow which floats above the\r\nbroken globe of the Hopes, and the coronets in space to which the hand\r\npoints in the crest of the family of Dunbar of Boath, with many other\r\nsimilar absurdities.\r\n\r\nIn England an equal necessity for difference is insisted upon in the crest\r\nas is everywhere insisted upon with regard to the coat of arms; and in the\r\ntime of the late Garter King of Arms, it was rapidly becoming almost\r\nimpossible to obtain a new crest which has not got a row of small objects\r\nin front of it, or else two somethings, one on either side. (Things,\r\nhowever, have now considerably improved.) If a crest is to be depicted\r\nbetween two ostrich feathers, for example, it stands to reason that the\r\ncentral object should be placed upon the centre of the helmet, whilst the\r\nostrich feathers would be one on either side--that is, placed in a position\r\nslightly above the ears. Yet, if a helmet is to be rigidly depicted in\r\nprofile, with such a crest, it is by no means inconceivable that the one\r\nostrich feather at the one side would hide both the other ostrich feather\r\nand the central object, leaving the crest to appear when properly depicted\r\n(for example, if photographed from a profile view of an actual helmet) as a\r\nsingle ostrich feather. Take, for instance, the Sievier crest, which is an\r\nestoile between two ostrich feathers. If that crest were properly depicted\r\nupon a profile helmet, the one ostrich feather {321} would undoubtedly hide\r\neverything else, for it is hardly likely that the estoile would be placed\r\nedge-forwards upon an actual helmet; and to properly display it, it ought\r\nto take its place upon an affronté helmet. Under the present rules it would\r\nbe officially depicted with the estoile facing the side, one ostrich\r\nfeather in front over the nose, and the other at the back of the head,\r\nwhich of course reduces it to an absurdity. To take another example, one\r\nmight instance the crest of Sir William Crookes. It is hardly to be\r\nsupposed that a helmet would ever have been borne into a tournament\r\nsurmounted by an elephant looking out over the side; it would most\r\ncertainly have had its head placed to the front; and yet, because Sir\r\nWilliam Crookes is a knight, he is required to use an affronté helmet, with\r\na crest which most palpably was designed for use in profile. The absurd\r\nposition which has resulted is chiefly due to the position rules and\r\nlargely a consequence of the hideous British practice (for no other nation\r\nhas ever adopted it) of depicting, as is so often done, a coat of arms and\r\ncrest without the intervening helmet and mantling; though perhaps another\r\ncause may have had its influence. I allude to the fact that an animal's\r\nhead, for example, in profile, is considered quite a different crest to the\r\nsame animal's head when placed affronté; and so long as this idea holds,\r\nand so long as the rules concerning the position of the helmet exist, for\r\nso long shall we have these glaring and ridiculous anomalies. And whilst\r\none generation of a family has an affronté helmet and another using the\r\nsame crest may have a profile one, it is useless to design crests\r\nspecifically to fit the one or the other.\r\n\r\nMr. G. W. Eve, who is certainly one of the most accomplished heraldic\r\nartists of the present time, has adopted a plan in his work which, whilst\r\nconforming with the rules to which I have referred, has reduced the\r\npeculiarities resulting from their observance to a minimum. His plan is\r\nsimple, inasmuch as, with a crest which is plainly affronté and has to be\r\ndepicted upon a profile helmet, he slightly alters the perspective of each,\r\ntwisting round the helmet, which, whilst remaining slightly in profile,\r\nmore nearly approaches the affronté position, and bringing the crest\r\nslightly round to meet it. In this way he has obtained some very good\r\nresults from awkward predicaments. Mr. Joseph Foster, in his \"Peerage and\r\nBaronetage,\" absolutely discarded all rules affecting the position of the\r\nhelmet; and though the artistic results may be excellent, his plan cannot\r\nbe commended, because whilst rules exist they ought to be adhered to. At\r\nthe same time, it must be frankly admitted that the laws of position seem\r\nutterly unnecessary. No other country has them--they are, as has been\r\nshown, impracticable from the artistic {322} standpoint; and there can be\r\nvery little doubt that it is highly desirable that they should be wholly\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\nIt is quite proper that there should be some means of distinction, and it\r\nwould seem well that the helmet with grilles should be reserved for peers.\r\nIn this we should be following or closely approximating to the rules\r\nobserved formerly upon the Continent, and if all questions of position are\r\nwaived the only difficulty which remains is the helmet of baronets and\r\nknights. The full-faced open helmet is ugly in the extreme--anything would\r\nbe preferable (except an open helmet in profile), and probably it would be\r\nbetter to wipe out the rule on this point as well. Knights of any Order\r\nhave the circle of that order within which to place their shields, and\r\nbaronets have the augmentations of their rank and degree. The knight\r\nbachelor would be the only one to suffer. The gift of a plain circlet\r\naround the shield or (following the precedent of a baronet), a spur upon a\r\ncanton or inescutcheon, could easily remove any cause of complaint.\r\n\r\nBut whilst one may think it well to urge strongly the alteration of\r\nexisting rules, it should not be considered permissible to ignore rules\r\nwhich undoubtedly do exist whilst those rules remain in force.\r\n\r\nThe helmets of knights and baronets and of esquires and gentlemen, in\r\naccordance with present official practice, are usually ornamented with\r\ngold, though this would not appear to be a fixed and unalterable rule.\r\n\r\nWhen two or more crests need to be depicted, various expedients are\r\nadopted. The English official practice is to paint one helmet only, and\r\nboth the crests are detached from it. The same plan was formerly adopted in\r\nScotland. The dexter crest is naturally the more important and the\r\nprincipal one in each case. By using one helmet only the necessity of\r\nturning the dexter crest to face the sinister is obviated.\r\n\r\nThe present official method adopted in England of depicting three crests is\r\nto use one helmet only, and all three crests face to the dexter. The centre\r\none, which is placed on the helmet, is the principal or first crest, that\r\non the dexter side the second, and the one on the sinister the third.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the land of many crests (no less than thirteen were borne above\r\nthe shield of the Margraves of Brandenburg-Anspach), there has from the\r\nearliest times been a fixed invariable practice of never dissociating a\r\ncrest from the helmet which supported it, and consequently one helmet to\r\nevery crest has long been the only recognised procedure. In the United\r\nKingdom duplication of crests is quite a modern practice. Amongst the\r\nPlantagenet Garter plates there is not a single example to be found of a\r\ncoat of arms with more than a single crest, and there is no ancient British\r\nexample of more {323} than one helmet which can be referred to for\r\nguidance. The custom originated in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\nin Germany. This point is more fully dealt with in the chapter devoted to\r\nthe consideration of crests, but it may be here noted that in Austria a\r\nknight may place two and a baron three helmets over his shield. The\r\nContinental practice is as follows: When the number of the helms is even,\r\nthey are arranged so that all look inwards towards the centre line of the\r\nescutcheon, half being turned to the dexter, half to the sinister. If the\r\nnumber be uneven, the principal helm is placed in the centre affronté, the\r\nothers with their crests being turned towards it; thus, some face to the\r\ndexter, some to the sinister. The crests are always turned with the\r\nhelmets. In Scandinavia the centre helm is affronté; the others, with their\r\ncrests, are often turned outwards.\r\n\r\nEnglish officialism, whilst confining its own emblazonments to one helmet\r\nonly, has never sought to assert that the use of two or more was either\r\nincorrect or faulty heraldry, and particularly in these later days of the\r\nrevival of heraldic art in this country, all heraldic artists, following\r\nthe German example, are inclined to give each crest its own helmet. This\r\npractice has been adopted during the last few years by Lyon King of Arms,\r\nand now all paintings of arms in Lyon Register which have two crests have\r\nthe same number of helmets. Some of the Bath stall plates in Henry VII.'s\r\nchapel in Westminster Abbey also display two helmets.\r\n\r\nWhen two helmets are used, it has been customary, still following the\r\nGerman model, to turn them to face each other, except in the cases of the\r\nfull-faced helmets of a knight or baronet, and (with the same exception)\r\nwhen three helmets have been employed the outer ones have been placed to\r\nface the centre, whilst the centre one has been placed in profile, as would\r\nbe the case were it standing alone. But the multiplication of English\r\ncrests in number, all of which as granted are required to differ, has\r\nnaturally resulted in the stereotyping of points of difference in attitude,\r\n&c., and the inevitable consequence is unfortunately that without\r\nsacrificing this character of differentiation it is impossible to allow the\r\nEnglish heraldic artist the same latitude and freedom of disposition with\r\nregard to crests that his German confrère enjoys. These remarks apply\r\nsolely to English and Irish crests, for Scottish practices, requiring no\r\ndifferentiation in the crests, have left Scottish crests simple and\r\nunspoiled. In England the result is that to \"play\" with the position of a\r\ncrest frequently results in an entire alteration of its character, and\r\nconsequently, as there is nothing whatever in the nature of a law or of a\r\nrule to the contrary, it is quite as usual to now find that two profile\r\nhelmets are both placed to face the dexter, as placed to face each other.\r\nAnother point seems also in {324} England to have been lost sight of in\r\nborrowing our methods from Germany. They hold themselves at liberty to, and\r\nusually _do_, make all their _charges on the shield_ face to the centre.\r\nThis is never done in England, where all face to the dexter. It seems\r\ntherefore to me an anomaly to apply one rule to the shield and another to\r\nthe helmet, and personally I prefer that both helmets and all charges\r\nshould face the dexter.\r\n\r\nIn British heraldry (and in fact the rule is universal) no woman other than\r\na reigning Sovereign is permitted to surmount her arms by a helmet.\r\nWoodward states that \"Many writers have denied the right of ecclesiastics\r\n(and, of course, of women) to the use of helmet and crest. Spener, the\r\ngreat German herald, defends their use by ecclesiastics, and says that, in\r\nGermany at any rate, universal custom is opposed to the restriction. There\r\nthe prelates, abbots, and abbesses, who held princely fiefs by military\r\ntenure, naturally retained the full knightly insignia.\"\r\n\r\nIn official English heraldry, there is a certain amount of confirmation and\r\na certain amount of contradiction of this supposed rule which denies a\r\nhelmet to an ecclesiastic. A grant of arms to a clergyman at the present\r\nday, and at all times previously, after the granting of crests had become\r\nusual, contains the grant of the crest and the emblazonment shows the\r\nhelmet. But the grant of arms to a bishop is different. The emblazonment of\r\nthe arms is surmounted by a mitre, and the crest is depicted in the body of\r\nthe patent away from and distinct from the emblazonment proper in the\r\nmargin. But the fact that a crest is granted proves that there is not any\r\ndisability inherent in the ecclesiastic which debars him from the\r\npossession of the helmet and crest, and the rule which must be deduced, and\r\nwhich really is the definite and accepted rule, is that a mitre cannot be\r\ndisplayed together with a helmet or crest. It must be one or other, and as\r\nthe mitre is indicative of the higher rank, it is the crest and helmet\r\nwhich are discarded.\r\n\r\nThere are few rules in heraldry to which exceptions cannot be found, and\r\nthere is a painting now preserved in the College of Arms, which depicts the\r\narms of the Bishop of Durham surmounted by a helmet, that in its turn being\r\nsurmounted by the mitre of episcopal rank. But the Bishopric of Durham was,\r\nin addition to its episcopal character, a temporal Palatinate, and the arms\r\nof the Bishops of that See therefore logically present many differences and\r\nexceptions from established heraldic rules.\r\n\r\nThe rules with regard to the use of helmets for the coats of arms of\r\ncorporate bodies are somewhat vague and vary considerably. All counties,\r\ncities, and towns, and all corporate bodies to whom crests have been\r\ngranted in England, have the ordinary closed profile helmet {325} of an\r\nesquire or gentleman. No grant of a crest has as yet been made to an\r\nEnglish university, so that it is impossible to say that no helmet would be\r\nallowed, or if it were allowed what it would be.\r\n\r\nFor some reason the arms of the City of London are always depicted with the\r\nhelmet of a peer, but as the crest is not officially recorded, the\r\nprivilege necessarily has no official sanction or authority.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the helmet painted upon a grant of arms to town or city is\r\nalways the open full-faced helmet of a knight or baronet. But in the grant\r\nof arms to a county, where it includes a crest, the helmet is that of an\r\nesquire, which is certainly curious.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland no helmet at all was painted upon the patent granting arms to\r\nthe city of Belfast, in spite of the fact that a crest was included in the\r\ngrant, and the late Ulster King of Arms informed me he would not allow a\r\nhelmet to any impersonal arms.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to avoid errors of anachronism when depicting helmet\r\nand shield. The shapes of these should bear some approximate relation to\r\neach other in point of date. It is preferable that the helmet should be so\r\nplaced that its lower extremity reaches somewhat over the edge of the\r\nshield. The inclined position of the shield in emblazonment is borrowed\r\nfrom the natural order of things, because the shield hanging by its chain\r\nor shield-strap (the guige), which was so balanced that the shield should\r\nmost readily fall into a convenient position when slung on the rider's\r\nshoulders, would naturally retain its equilibrium only in a slanting\r\ndirection. {326}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE CREST\r\n\r\nIf uncertainty exists as to the origin of arms, it is as nothing to the\r\nhuge uncertainty that exists concerning the beginnings of the crest. Most\r\nwonderful stories are told concerning it; that it meant this and meant the\r\nother, that the right to bear a crest was confined to this person or the\r\nother person. But practically the whole of the stories of this kind are\r\neither wild imagination or conjecture founded upon insufficient facts.\r\n\r\nThe real facts--which one may as well state first as a basis to work\r\nupon--are very few and singularly unconvincing, and are useless as original\r\ndata from which to draw conclusions.\r\n\r\nFirst of all we have the definite, assured, and certain fact that the\r\nearliest known instance of a crest is in 1198, and we find evidence of the\r\nuse of arms before that date.\r\n\r\nThe next fact is that we find infinitely more variation in the crests used\r\nby given families than in the arms, and that whilst the variations in the\r\narms are as a rule trivial, and not affecting the general design of the\r\nshield, the changes in the crest are frequently radical, the crest borne by\r\na family at one period having no earthly relation to that borne by the same\r\nfamily at another.\r\n\r\nAgain, we find that though the occasional use of a crest can (by isolated\r\ninstances) be taken back, as already stated, to a fairly early period, the\r\nuse of crests did not become general until very much later.\r\n\r\nAnother fact is that, except perhaps in the persons of sovereigns, there is\r\nno official instance, nor any other authentic instance of importance, in\r\nwhich a crest appears ever to have been used by a woman until these recent\r\nand unfortunate days when unofficial examples can be found of the wildest\r\nignorance of all armorial rules.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing may be taken as general principles which no authentic\r\ninstance known can be said to refute.\r\n\r\nBearing these in mind, let us now see what other results can be obtained by\r\ndeduction from specific instances.\r\n\r\nThe earliest form in which anything can be found in the nature of a crest\r\nis the lion upon the head-dress of Geoffrey, Count of Anjou (Fig. 28). This\r\nhas been already referred to. {327}\r\n\r\nThe helmet of Philippe D'Alsace, Count of Flanders (_c._ 1181), has painted\r\nupon the side the same figure of a lion which appears upon his shield.\r\n\r\nWhat is usually accepted as the earliest authenticated instance of a\r\nregular crest is that afforded by the Great Seal of King Richard I. of\r\nEngland, which shows over the helmet a lion passant painted upon the\r\nfan-shaped ornament which surmounts the helmet.\r\n\r\nIf one accepts--as most people nowadays are inclined to do--the Darwinian\r\ntheory of evolution, the presumption is that the development of the human\r\nbeing, through various intermediate links including the ape, can be traced\r\nback to those cell-like formations which are the most \"original\" types of\r\nlife which are known to us. At the same time one is hardly disposed to\r\nassert that some antediluvian jellyfish away back in past ages was the\r\nfirst human being. By a similar, but naturally more restricted argument,\r\none cannot accept these paintings upon helmets, nor possibly can one accept\r\npaintings upon the fan-like ornaments which surmounted the helmet, as\r\nexamples of crests. The rudiments and origin of crests doubtless they were.\r\nCrests they were not.\r\n\r\nWe must go back, once again, to the bed-rock of the peacock-popinjay vanity\r\ningrained in human nature. The same impulse which nowadays leads to the\r\ndecoration of the helmets of the Life Guards with horsehair plumes and\r\nregimental badges, the cocked hats of field-marshals and other officers\r\nwith waving plumes, the képis of commissionaires, and the smasher hats of\r\nColonial irregulars with cocks' feathers, the hat of the poacher and\r\ngamekeeper with a pheasant's feather, led unquestionably to the\r\n\"decoration\" of the helmets of the armoured knights of old. The matter was\r\njust a combination of decoration and vanity. At first (Fig. 569) they\r\nfrequently painted their helmets, and as with the gradual evolution and\r\ncrystallisation of armory a certain form of decoration (the device upon his\r\nshield) became identified with a certain person, that particular device was\r\nused for the decoration of the helmet and painted thereupon.\r\n\r\nThen it was found that a fan-shaped erection upon the helmet improved its\r\nappearance, and, without adding greatly to its weight, advantaged it as a\r\nhead protection by attracting the blow of an opponent's sword, and\r\nlessening or nullifying its force ere the blow reached the actual\r\ncrown-plates of the helmet. Possibly in this we see the true origin (as in\r\nthe case of the scalloped edges of the mantling) of the serrated border\r\nwhich appears upon these fan-shaped erections. But this last suggestion is\r\nno more than a conjecture of my own, and may not be correct, for human\r\nnature has always had a weakness for decoration, and ever has been\r\nagreeable to pay the extra {328} penny in the \"tuppence\" for the coloured\r\nor decorated variety. The many instances which can be found of these\r\nfan-shaped ornaments upon helmets in a perfectly undecorated form leads me\r\nto unhesitatingly assert that they originated _not_ as crests, nor as a\r\nvehicle for the display of crests, but as an integral and protective part\r\nof the _helmet_ itself. The origin of the crest is due to the decoration of\r\nthe fan. The derivation of the word \"crest,\" from the Latin _crista_, a\r\ncock's comb, should put the supposition beyond any doubt.\r\n\r\nDisregarding crests of later grant or assumption, one can assert with\r\nconfidence that a large proportion of those--particularly in German armory,\r\nwhere they are so frequent--which we now find blazoned or depicted as wings\r\nor plumes, carrying a device, are nothing more than developments of or\r\nderivatives from these fan-shaped ornaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 610.--From the seal (1301) of Richard FitzAlan, Earl of\r\nArundel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 611.--From the seal (1301) of Humphrey de Bohm, Earl of\r\nHereford.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 612.--From the seal (1305) of Edward of Carnarvon,\r\nPrince of Wales.]\r\n\r\nThese fans being (from other reasons) in existence, of course, and very\r\nnaturally, were painted and decorated, and equally of course such\r\ndecoration took the form of the particular decoration associated with the\r\nowner, namely, the device upon the shield. It seems to me, and for long has\r\nso seemed, essentially strange that no specialist authority, writing upon\r\narmory, has noticed that these \"fans\" (as I will call them) are really a\r\npart, though possibly only a decorative part, of the helmet itself. There\r\nhas always in these matters been far too great a tendency on the part of\r\nwriters to accept conclusions of earlier authorities ready made, and to\r\nsimply treat these fans as selected and chosen crests. Figs. 610-612 are\r\ninstances of helmets having these fans. All are {329} taken from seals, and\r\nit is quite possible that the actual fans upon the seal helmets had some\r\ndevice painted upon them which it was impossible by reason of the size to\r\nrepresent upon the seal. As has been already stated, the great seal of\r\nRichard I. does show a lion painted on the fan.\r\n\r\nThere are many examples of the heraldic development of these fans,--for\r\ntheir use obtained even in this country long after the real heraldic crest\r\nhad an assured footing--and a typical example occurs in Fig. 613, but\r\nprobably the best-known instance, one which has been often illustrated, is\r\nthat from the effigy of Sir Geoffrey de Luttrell (_c._ 1340), which shows a\r\nfan of this character upon which the entire Luttrell arms are depicted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 613.--Arms of the family of Schaler (Basle): Gules, a\r\nbend of lozenges argent. (From the Zürich Roll of Arms.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 614.--Modern reverse of the Common Seal of the City of\r\nLondon (1539).]\r\n\r\nA much later instance in this country will be found in the seal (dated\r\n1539) of the City of London, which shows upon the helmet one of these\r\nfan-shaped ornaments, charged with the cross of the City arms (Fig. 614).\r\n\r\nThe arms of the City of London are recorded in the College of Arms\r\n(Vincent) without a crest (and by the way without supporters) and this seal\r\naffords a curious but a very striking and authentic instance of the extreme\r\naccuracy of the records of the College of Arms. There being no crest for\r\nthe City of London at the time of the preparation of this seal, recourse\r\nwas had to the ancient practice of depicting the whole or a part (in this\r\ncase a part) of the device of the shield upon a fan surmounting the helmet.\r\nIn course of time this fan, in the case of London, as in so many other\r\ncases, has through ignorance been {330} converted or developed into a wing,\r\nbut the \"rays\" of the fan in this instance are preserved in the \"rays\" of\r\nthe dragon's wing (charged with a cross) which the crest is now supposed to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nWhilst dealing with the arms of London, one of the favourite \"flaring\"\r\nexamples of ancient but unrecorded arms often mentioned as an instance in\r\nwhich the Records of the College of Arms are at fault, perhaps I may be\r\npardoned for adding that the shield _is_ recorded. The crest and supporters\r\nare not. The seeming omission as to the crest is explained above. The real\r\nsupporters of the City of London, to which a claim by user _could_ (even\r\nnow) be established (they are two lions, not dragons), had, with the single\r\nexception of their use upon the Mayor's seal, which use is continued to the\r\npresent day, been practically discarded. Consequently the lions as\r\nsupporters remained unclaimed, and therefore are not recorded.\r\n\r\nThe supporters now used (two dragons) are _raw new_ adornments, of which no\r\nexample can be found before the seventeenth century. Those naturally, being\r\n\"assumed\" without authority at so recent a date, are not recorded, which is\r\nyet another testimony to the impartial accuracy of the Heralds' College\r\nRecords.\r\n\r\nThe use of the fan-crest has long been obsolete in British armory, in which\r\nit can hardly ever be said to have had a very great footing, unless such\r\nuse was prevalent in the thirteenth century; but it still survives in\r\nGermany at the present day, where, in spite of the fact that many of these\r\nfans have now degenerated into reduplications of the arms upon wings or\r\nplumes of feathers, other crests to a considerable number are still\r\ndisplayed upon \"fans.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the current practices in British armory are the culmination of\r\nlong-continued ignorance. Some, mayhap, can be allowed to pass without\r\ncomment, but others deserve at any rate their share of criticism and\r\nremark. Amongst such may be included the objectionable practice, in the\r\ngrants of so many modern crests, of making the crest itself a _shield_\r\ncarrying a repetition of the arms or some other device, or of introducing\r\nin the crest an escutcheon. To the resuscitation of these \"fan\" repetitions\r\nof the shield device there is not, and cannot be, any objection. One would\r\neven, in these days of the multiplication of differentiated crests,\r\nrecommend this as a relief from the abominable rows of assorted objects\r\nnowadays placed (for the purposes of differentiation) in front of so many\r\nmodern crests. One would gladly see a reversion to the German development\r\n(from this source) of wings charged with the arms or a part of the armorial\r\ndevice; but one of the things a new grantee should pray to be delivered\r\nfrom is an escutcheon of any sort, shape, or form in the crest assigned to\r\nhim. {331}\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the \"fans\" upon the early helmets. Many of the\r\nexamples which have come down to us show the fan of a rather diminutive\r\nheight, but (in the form of an arc of a much enlarged circle) projected far\r\nforward beyond the front of the helmet, and carried far back, apparently as\r\na safeguard from blows which would otherwise descend upon the neck. (A\r\nsurvival of the fan, by the way, may perhaps be found in the dragoon\r\nhelmets of the time of the Peninsular War, in the firemen's helmets of\r\nto-day, and in the helmets now worn by different regiments in the Italian\r\narmy.) The very shape of these fans should prove they were originally a\r\nprotective part of the helmet. The long low shape, however, did not, as a\r\ngeneral circumstance, lend itself to its decoration by a duplication\r\nthereupon of the whole of the arms. Consequently these fans will nearly\r\nalways be found simply adorned with one figure from the shield. It should\r\nnot be forgotten that we are now dealing with a period in armory when the\r\ncharges upon the shield itself were very much, as far as number and\r\nposition are concerned, of an indeterminate character. If they were\r\nindeterminate for the shield, it evidences that there cannot have been any\r\nidea of a necessity to repeat the whole of the device upon the fan. As\r\nthere was seldom room or opportunity for the display of the whole device,\r\nwe invariably find that these fan decorations were a duplication of a\r\ndistinctive part, but not necessarily the whole of the device; and this\r\ndevice was disposed in the most suitable position which the shape of the\r\nfan would accommodate. Herein is the explanation of the fact that whilst\r\nthe arms of Percy, Talbot, and Mowbray were all, in varying tinctures, a\r\nlion rampant, the crest in each case was a lion passant or statant. In\r\nshort, the fan did not lend itself to the representation of a lion rampant,\r\nand consequently there is no early instance of such a crest. Perhaps the\r\ninsecurity of a large and heavy crest balanced upon one leg may be an added\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the evolution of the crest, there can be little doubt, was\r\nthe cutting of the fan into the outline of the crest, and though I know of\r\nno instance of such a crest on any effigy, there can be no reasonable doubt\r\non the point, if a little thought is given to the matter. Until a very much\r\nlater period, we never find in any heraldic representation that the helmet\r\nor crest are represented in an affronté position. Why? Simply because\r\ncrests at that period were merely profile representations.\r\n\r\nIn later days, when tournament crests were made of leather, the weight even\r\nof these was very considerable, but for tournament purposes that weight\r\ncould be endured. Half-a-dozen courses down the _barrière_ would be a\r\nvastly different matter to a whole day under arms in actual battle. Now a\r\ncrest cut out from a thin plate of metal set {332} on edge would weigh but\r\nlittle. But perhaps the strongest proof of all is to be found in the\r\nconstruction of so many German crests, which are adorned down the back with\r\na fan.\r\n\r\nNow it is hardly likely, if the demi-lion in relief had been the earliest\r\nform, that the fan would have been subsequently added to it. The fan is\r\nnothing more than the remains of the original fan-shaped ornament left when\r\nthe crest, or most likely only the front outline of it, had been cut out in\r\nprofile from the fan. We have no instance until a very much later period of\r\na crest which could not be depicted in profile, and in the representations\r\nof crests upon seals we have no means of forming a certain judgment that\r\nthese representations are not of profile crests, for the very nature of the\r\ncraft of seal-engraving would lead the engraver to add a certain amount of\r\nrelief, even if this did not actually exist. It is out of the question to\r\nsuppose, by reason of their weight, that crests were made in metal. But if\r\nmade of leather, as were the tournament crests, what protection did the\r\ncrest add to the helmet? The fact that wreaths and coronets did not come\r\ninto use at the earliest advent of crests is confirmatory evidence of the\r\nfact that modelled crests did not exist, inasmuch as the fan prolonged in\r\nfront and prolonged behind was narrowed at its point of contact with the\r\nhelmet into such a diminished length that it was comparatively easy to slip\r\nthe mantling by means of a slit over the fan, or even drape it round it.\r\n\r\nMany of the old illustrations of tournaments and battles which have come\r\ndown to us show no crests on the helmets, but merely plumes of feathers or\r\nsome fan-shaped erection. Consequently it is a fairly safe conclusion that\r\nfor the actual purposes of warfare modelled crests never had any real\r\nexistence, or, if they had any such existence, that it was most limited.\r\nModelled crests were tournament crests. The crests that were used in battle\r\nmust have been merely cut out in profile from the fan. Then came the era,\r\nin Plantagenet times, of the tournament. We talk glibly about tournaments,\r\nbut few indeed really know much about them. Trial by combat and the real\r\ntournament _à l'outrance_ seldom occurred, and though trial by combat\r\nremained upon the statute-book until the 59 Geo. III., it was seldom\r\ninvoked. Tournaments were chiefly in the nature of athletic displays,\r\ntaking the place of our games and sports, and inasmuch as they contributed\r\nto the training of the soldier, were held in the high repute that polo, for\r\nexample, now enjoys amongst the upper and military classes. Added to this,\r\nthe tournament was the essential climax of ceremony and ceremonial, and in\r\nall its details was ordered by such strict regulations, rules, and\r\nsupervision that its importance and its position in the public and official\r\nestimate was far in advance of its present-day equivalents. {333}\r\n\r\nThe joust was fought with tilting-spears, the \"tourney\" with swords. The\r\nrules and regulations for jousts and tournaments drawn up by the High\r\nConstable of England in the reign of Edward IV. show clearly that in\r\nneither was contemplated any risk of life.\r\n\r\nIn the tourney the swords were blunted and without points, but the\r\nprincipal item was always the joust, which was fought with tilting-spears\r\nand shields. Many representations of the tourney show the participants\r\nwithout shields. The general ignorance as to the manner in which the tilt\r\nwas run is very widespread. A strong barrier was erected straight down the\r\ncentre of the lists, and the knights were placed one on either side, so\r\nthat by no possible chance could the two horses come into contact. Those\r\nwho will read Mallory's \"Morte d'Arthur\" carefully--bearing in mind that\r\nMallory described legendary events of an earlier period clothed in the\r\nmanners and customs of his own day (time of Edward IV.), and made no\r\nattempt to reproduce the manners and customs and real atmosphere of the\r\nArthurian times, which could have had no relation to the manners and\r\nproceedings which Sir Thomas Mallory employs in telling his legends--will\r\nnotice that, when it came to jousting, some half-dozen courses would be all\r\nthat were run between contending knights. In fact the tournament rules\r\nabove referred to say, for the tourney, that two blows at passage and ten\r\nat the joining ought to suffice. The time which this would occupy would not\r\nexceed the period for which any man could easily sustain the weight of a\r\nmodelled crest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 615.--Crest of Roger de Quincey, Earl of Winchester (d.\r\n1264). (From his seal.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 616.--Crest of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. (From his\r\nseal, 1301.)]\r\n\r\nAnother point needs to be borne in mind. The result of a joust depended\r\nupon the points scored, the highest number being gained for the absolute\r\nunhorsing of an opponent. This, however, happened comparatively seldom, and\r\npoints or \"spears\" were scored for the lances broken upon an opponent's\r\nhelmet, shield, or body, and the points so scored were subject to deduction\r\nif the opponent's horse were touched, and under other circumstances. The\r\nhead of the tilting-spear which was used was a kind of rosette, and\r\nheraldic representations are really incorrect in adding a point when the\r\nweapon is described as a tilting-spear. Whilst a fine point meeting a\r\nwooden shield or metal armour would stick in the one or glance off the\r\nother, and neither result in the breaking of the lance nor in the unhorsing\r\nof the opponent, a broad rosette would convey a heavy shock. But to effect\r\nthe desired object the tilting-spear would need to meet resistance, and\r\nlittle would be gained by knocking off an opponent's ornamental crest.\r\nCertainly no prize appears to have been allotted for the performance of\r\nthis feat (which always attracts the imagination of the novelist), whilst\r\nthere was for striking the \"sight\" of the helmet. Consequently there was\r\nnothing to be gained from the protection to {334} the helmet which the fan\r\nof earlier date afforded, and the tendency of ceremonial led to the use in\r\ntournaments of helmets and elaborate crests which were not those used in\r\nbattle. The result is that we find these tournament or ceremonial crests\r\nwere of large and prominent size, and were carved in wood, or built up of\r\nleather. But I firmly believe that these crests were used only for\r\nceremonial and tournament purposes, and were never actually worn in battle.\r\nThat these modelled crests in relief are the ones that we find upon\r\neffigies is only natural, and what one would expect, inasmuch as a man's\r\neffigy displayed his garments and accoutrements in the most ornate and\r\nhonourable form. The same idea exists at the present day. The subjects of\r\nmodern effigies and modern portraits are represented in robes, and with\r\ninsignia which are seldom if ever worn, and which sometimes even have no\r\nexistence in fact. In the same way the ancient effigies are the\r\nrepresentations of the ceremonial dress and not the everyday garb of those\r\nfor whom they stand. But even allowing all the foregoing, it must be\r\nadmitted that it is from these ceremonial or tournament helmets and crests\r\nthat the heraldic crest has obtained its importance, and herein lies the\r\nreason of the exaggerated size of early heraldic crests, and also the\r\nunsuitability of some few for actual use. Tournaments were flourishing in\r\nthe Plantagenet, Yorkist, and Lancastrian periods, and ended with the days\r\nof the Tudor dynasty; and the Plantagenet period witnessed the rise of the\r\nceremonial and heraldic crest. But in the days when crests had any actual\r\nexistence they were made to fit the helmet, and the crests in Figs. 615-618\r\nshow crests very much more naturally disposed than those of later periods.\r\n{335} Crests appear to have come into wider and more general use in Germany\r\nat an earlier period than is the case in this country, for in the early\r\npart of the thirteenth century seals are there to be met with having only\r\nthe device of helmet and crest thereupon, a proof that the \"oberwappen\"\r\n(helmet and crest) was then considered of equal or greater value than the\r\nshield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 617.--Crest of William de Montagu, Earl of Salisbury\r\n(d. 1344). (From his seal.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 618.--Crest of Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham,\r\nand Earl Marshal. (From a drawing of his seal, 1389: MS Cott., Julius, C.\r\nvii.)]\r\n\r\nThe actual tournament crests were made of light material, pasteboard,\r\ncloth, or a leather shell over a wood or wire framework filled with tow,\r\nsponge, or sawdust. Fig. 271, which shows the shield, helmet, and crest of\r\nthe Black Prince undoubtedly contemporary, dating from 1376, and now\r\nremaining in Canterbury Cathedral, is made of leather and is a good example\r\nof an actual crest, but even this, there can be little doubt, was never\r\ncarried in battle or tournament, and is no more than a ceremonial crest\r\nmade for the funeral pageant.\r\n\r\nThe heraldic wings which are so frequently met with in crests are not the\r\nnatural wings of a bird, but are a development from the fan, and in actual\r\ncrests were made of wooden or basket-work strips, and probably at an\r\nearlier date were not intended to represent wings, but were mere pieces of\r\nwood painted and existing for the display of a certain device. Their shape\r\nand position led to their transition into \"wings,\" and then they were\r\ncovered with dyed or natural-coloured feathers. It was the art of heraldic\r\nemblazonment which ignored the practical details, that first copied the\r\nwing from nature.\r\n\r\nActual crests were fastened to the helmets they surmounted by {336} means\r\nof ribbons, straps, laces (which developed later into the fillet and\r\ntorse), or rivets, and in Germany they were ornamented with hanging and\r\ntinkling metal leaves, tiny bells, buffalo horns, feathers, and projecting\r\npieces of wood, which formed vehicles for still further decorative\r\nappendages.\r\n\r\nThen comes the question, what did the crest signify? Many have asserted\r\nthat no one below the rank of a knight had the right to use a crest; in\r\nfact some writers have asserted, and doubtless correctly as regards a\r\ncertain period, that only those who were of tournament rank might assume\r\nthe distinction, and herein lies another confirmation of the supposition\r\nthat crests had a closer relation to the tournament than to the\r\nbattlefield.\r\n\r\nDoubts as to a man's social position might disqualify him from\r\nparticipation in a tournament--hence the \"helme-schau\" previously referred\r\nto--but they certainly never relieved him from the obligations of warfare\r\nimposed by the tenure under which he held his lands. There is no doubt,\r\nhowever, that whatever the regulation may have been--and there seems little\r\nchance of our ever obtaining any real knowledge upon the point--the right\r\nto display a crest was an additional privilege and honour, something extra\r\nand beyond the right to a shield of arms. For how long any such supposition\r\nheld good it is difficult to say, for whilst we find in the latter part of\r\nthe fourteenth century that all the great nobles had assumed and were using\r\ncrests, and whilst there is but one amongst the Plantagenet Garter plates\r\nwithout a crest where a helmet has been represented above the shield, we\r\nalso find that the great bulk of the lesser landed gentry bore arms, but\r\nmade no pretension to a crest. The lesser gentry were bound to fight in\r\nwar, but not necessarily in the tournament. Arms were a necessity of\r\nwarfare, crests were not. This continued to be the case till the end of the\r\nsixteenth century, for we find that at one of the Visitations no crests\r\nwhatever are inserted with the arms and pedigrees of the families set out\r\nin the Visitation Book, and one is probably justified in assuming that\r\nwhilst this state of feeling and this idea existed, the crest was highly\r\nthought of, and valued possibly beyond the shield of arms, for with those\r\nof that rank of life which aspired to the display of a crest the right to\r\narms would be a matter of course. In the latter part of the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth and in Stuart days the granting of crests to ancient arms became\r\na widespread practice. Scores upon scores of such grants can be referred\r\nto, and I have myself been led to the irresistible conclusion that the\r\nopportunity afforded by the grant of a crest was urged by the heralds and\r\nofficers of arms, in order to give them the opportunity of confirming and\r\nrecording arms which they knew needed such confirmation to be\r\n\r\n{337} rendered legal, without giving offence to those who had borne these\r\narms merely by strength of user for some prolonged but at the same time\r\ninsufficient period to confer an unquestioned right. That has always seemed\r\nto me the obvious reason which accounts for these numberless grants of\r\ncrests to apparently existing arms, which arms are recited and emblazoned\r\nin the patents, because there are other grants of crests which can be\r\nreferred to, though these are singularly few in number, in which the arms\r\nare entirely ignored. But as none of these grants, which are of a crest\r\nonly, appear to have been made to families whose right to arms was not\r\nabsolutely beyond question or dispute, the conclusion above recited appears\r\nto be irresistible. The result of these numerous grants of crests, which I\r\nlook upon as carrying greater importance in the sense that they were also\r\nconfirmations of the arms, resulted in the fact that the value and dignity\r\nof the crest slowly but steadily declined, and the cessation of tournaments\r\nand, shortly afterwards, the marked decline in funereal pageantry no doubt\r\ncontributed largely to the same result. Throughout the Stuart period\r\ninstances can be found, though not very frequently, of grants of arms\r\nwithout the grant of a crest being included in the patent; but the practice\r\nwas soon to entirely cease, and roughly speaking one may assert that since\r\nthe beginning of the Hanoverian dynasty no person has ever been granted\r\narms without the corresponding grant of a crest, if a crest could be\r\nproperly borne with the arms. Now no crest has ever been granted where the\r\nright to arms has not existed or been simultaneously conferred, and\r\ntherefore, whilst there are still many coats of arms legally in existence\r\nwithout a crest, a crest cannot exist without a coat of arms, so that those\r\npeople, and they are many, who vehemently assert a right to the \"_crest_ of\r\ntheir family,\" whilst admitting they have no right to arms, stand\r\nself-convicted heraldically both of having spoken unutterable rubbish, and\r\nof using a crest to which they can have no possible right. One exception,\r\nand one only, have I ever come across to the contrary, and very careful\r\ninquiry can bring me knowledge of no other. That crest is the crest of a\r\nfamily of Buckworth, now represented by Sir Charles Buckworth-Herne-Soame,\r\nBart. This family at the time of the Visitations exhibited a certain coat\r\nof arms and crest. The coat of arms, which doubtless interfered with the\r\nrights of some other family, was respited for further proof; but the crest,\r\nwhich did not, appears to have been allowed, and as nothing further was\r\ndone with regard to the arms, the crest stood, whilst the arms were bad.\r\nBut even this one exception has long since been rectified, for when the\r\nadditional name and arms of Soame were assumed by Royal License, the arms\r\nwhich had been exhibited and respited were (with the addition of an ermine\r\nspot as a charge upon the chevron) granted as the arms of Buckworth to be\r\nborne quarterly with the arms of Soame.\r\n\r\nPLATE VI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{338}\r\n\r\nWith the cessation of tournaments, we get to the period which some writers\r\nhave stigmatised as that of \"paper\" heraldry. That is a reference to the\r\nfact that arms and crests ceased to be painted upon shields or erected upon\r\nhelmets that enjoyed actual use in battle and tournament. Those who are so\r\nready to decry modern heraldry forget that from its very earliest existence\r\nheraldry has always had the _same_ significance as a symbol of rank and\r\nsocial position which it now enjoys and which remains undiminished in\r\nextent, though doubtless less potent in effect. They forget also that from\r\nthe very earliest period armory had three uses--viz. its martial use, its\r\ndecorative use, and its use as a symbol of ownership. The two latter uses\r\nstill remain in their entirety, and whilst that is the case, armory cannot\r\nbe treated as a dead science.\r\n\r\nBut with the cessation of tournaments the decorative became the chief use\r\nof arms, and the crest soon ceased to have that distinctive adaptability to\r\nthe purpose of a helmet ornament. Up to the end of the Tudor period crests\r\nhad retained their original simplicity. Animals' heads and animals passant,\r\nhuman heads and demi-animals, comprised the large majority of the early\r\ncrests. Scottish heraldry in a marked degree has retained the early\r\nsimplicity of crests, though at the expense of lack of distinction between\r\nthe crests of different families. German heraldry has to a large extent\r\nretained the same character as has Scottish armory, and though many of the\r\ncrests are decidedly elaborated, it is noticeable that this elaboration is\r\nnever such as to render the crest unsuitable for its true position upon a\r\nhelmet.\r\n\r\nIn England this aspect of the crest has been almost entirely lost sight of,\r\nand a large proportion of the crests in modern English grants are utterly\r\nunsuitable for use in relief upon an actual helmet. Our present rules of\r\nposition for a helmet, and our unfortunate stereotyped form of wreath, are\r\nlargely to blame, but the chief reason is the definite English rule that\r\nthe crests of separate English families must be differentiated as are the\r\narms. No such rule holds good in Scotland, hence their simple crests.\r\n\r\nWhether the rule is good or bad it is difficult to say. When all the pros\r\nand cons have been taken into consideration, the whole discussion remains a\r\nmatter of opinion, and whilst one dislikes the Scottish idea under which\r\nthe same identical crest can be and regularly is granted to half-a-dozen\r\npeople of as many different surnames, one objects very considerably to the\r\ntypical present-day crest of an English grant of arms. Whilst a collar can\r\nbe put round an animal's neck, and whilst it can hold objects in its mouth\r\nor paws, it does seem {339} ridiculous to put a string of varied and\r\nselected objects \"in front\" of it, when these plainly would only be visible\r\nfrom one side, or to put a crest \"between\" objects if these are to be\r\nrepresented \"fore and aft,\" one toppling over the brow of the wearer of the\r\nhelmet and the other hanging down behind.\r\n\r\nThe crests granted by the late Sir Albert Woods, Garter, are the crying\r\ngrievance of modern English heraldry, and though a large proportion are far\r\ngreater abortions than they need be, and though careful thought and\r\nresearch even yet will under the present régime result in the grant of at\r\nany rate a quite unobjectionable crest, nevertheless we shall not obtain a\r\nreal reform, or attain to any appreciable improvement, until the \"position\"\r\nrule as to helmets is abolished. Some of the crests mentioned hereunder are\r\ntypical and awful examples of modern crests.\r\n\r\n    Crest of Bellasis of Marton, Westmoreland: A mount vert, thereon a lion\r\n    couchant guardant azure, in front of a tent proper, lined gules.\r\n\r\n    Crest of Hermon of Preston, Lancashire, and Wyfold Court, Checkendon,\r\n    Oxon.: In front of two palm-trees proper, a lion couchant guardant\r\n    erminois, resting the dexter claw upon a bale of cotton proper.

E. Lamplugh, Esq.: In front of a cubit arm erect proper,\r\n    encircled about the wrist with a wreath of oak and holding in the hand\r\n    a sword also proper, pommel and hilt or, an escutcheon argent, charged\r\n    with a goat's head couped sable. Mottoes: \"Through,\" and \"Providentia\r\n    Dei stabiliuntur familiæ.\"\r\n\r\n    Crest of Glasford, Scotland: \"Issuing from clouds two hands conjoined\r\n    grasping a caduceus ensigned with a cap of liberty, all between two\r\n    cornucopiæ all proper. Motto: \"Prisca fides.\"\r\n\r\nWe now come to the subject of the inheritance of crests, concerning which\r\nthere has been much difference of opinion.\r\n\r\nIt is very usually asserted that until a comparatively recent date crests\r\nwere not hereditary, but were assumed, discarded, and changed at pleasure.\r\nLike many other incorrect statements, there is a certain modicum of truth\r\nin the statement, for no doubt whilst arms themselves {340} had a more or\r\nless shifting character, crests were certainly not \"fixed\" to any greater\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nBut I think no one has as yet discovered, or at any rate brought into\r\nnotice, the true facts of the case, or the real position of the matter, and\r\nI think I am the first to put into print what actually were the rules which\r\ngoverned the matter. The rules, I believe, were undoubtedly these:--\r\n\r\nCrests were, save in the remote beginning of things heraldic, definitely\r\nhereditary. They were hereditary even to the extent (and herein lies the\r\npoint which has not hitherto been observed) that they were transmitted by\r\nan heiress. Perhaps this heritability was limited to those cases in which\r\nthe heiress transmitted the _de facto_ headship of her house. We, judging\r\nby present laws, look upon the crest as a part of the _one_ heraldic\r\nachievement inseparable from the shield. What proof have we that in early\r\ntimes any necessary connection between arms and crest existed? We have\r\nnone. The shield of arms was one inheritance, descending by known rules.\r\nThe crest was another, but a separate inheritance, descending equally\r\nthrough an heir or coheir-general. The crest was, as an inheritance, as\r\nseparate from the shield as were the estates then. The social conditions of\r\nlife prevented the possibility of the existence or inheritance of a crest\r\nwhere arms did not exist. But a man inheriting several coats of arms from\r\ndifferent heiress ancestresses could marshal them all upon one shield, and\r\nthough we find the heir often made selection at his pleasure, and\r\nmarshalled the arms in various methods, the determination of which was a\r\nmere matter of arbitrary choice, he could, if he wished, use them all upon\r\none shield. But he had but one helmet, and could use and display but one\r\ncrest. So that, if he had inherited two, he was forced to choose which he\r\nwould use, though he sometimes tried to combine two into one device. It is\r\nquestionable if an instance can be found in England of the regular display\r\nof two helmets and crests together, surmounting one shield, before the\r\neighteenth century, but there are countless instances of the contemporary\r\nbut separate display of two different crests, and the Visitation Records\r\nafford us some number of instances of this tacit acknowledgment of the\r\ninheritance of more than one crest.\r\n\r\nThe patent altering or granting the Mowbray crest seems to me clear\r\nrecognition of the right of inheritance of a crest passing through an heir\r\nfemale. This, however, it must be admitted, may be really no more than a\r\ngrant, and is not in itself actual evidence that any crest had been\r\npreviously borne. My own opinion, however, is that it is fair presumptive\r\nevidence upon the point, and conveys an alteration and not a grant.\r\n\r\nThe translation of this Patent (Patent Roll 339, 17 Ric. II. pt. 1, {341}\r\nmemb. 2) is as follows: \"The King to all to whom, &c., Greeting, Know that\r\nwhereas our well-beloved and faithful kinsman, Thomas, Earl-Marshal and\r\nEarl of Nottingham, has a just hereditary title to bear for his crest a\r\nleopard or with a white label, which should be of right the crest of our\r\neldest son if we had begotten a son. We, for this consideration, have\r\ngranted for us and our heirs to the said Thomas and his heirs that for a\r\ndifference in this crest they shall and may bear a leopard, and in place of\r\na label a crown argent, without hindrance from us or our heirs\r\naforesaid.--In witness, &c. Witness the King at Westminster, the 12th day\r\nof January [17 Ric. II.]. By writ of Privy Seal.\"\r\n\r\nCases will constantly be found in which the crests have been changed. I\r\nnecessarily totally exclude from consideration crests which have been\r\nchanged owing to specific grants, and also changes due to the discarding of\r\ncrests which can be shown to have been borne without right. Changes in\r\ncrests must also be disregarded where the differences in emblazonment are\r\nmerely differences in varying designs of the same crest. Necessarily from\r\nnone of these instances can a law of inheritance be deduced. But if other\r\nchanges in the crests of important families be considered, I think it will\r\nbe very evident that practically the whole of these are due to the\r\ninheritance through heiresses or ancestresses of an alternative crest. It\r\ncan be readily shown that selection played an important part in the\r\nmarshalling of quarterings upon an escutcheon, and where important\r\nquarterings were inherited they are as often as not found depicted in the\r\nfirst quarter. Thus the Howards have borne at different periods the wings\r\nof Howard; the horse of Fitzalan; and the Royal crest granted to the\r\nMowbrays with remainder to the heir general; and these crests have been\r\nborne, as will be seen from the Garter plates, quite irrespective of what\r\nthe surname in use may have been. Consequently it is very evident the\r\ncrests were considered to be inherited with the representation of the\r\ndifferent families. The Stourton crest was originally a stag's head, and is\r\nto be seen recorded in one of the Visitations, and upon the earliest seal\r\nin existence of any member of the family. But after the inheritance through\r\nthe heiress of Le Moyne, the Le Moyne crest of the demi-monk was adopted.\r\nThe Stanleys, Earls of Derby, whatever their original crest may have been,\r\ninherited the well-known bird and bantling of the family of Lathom. The\r\nTalbot crest was originally a talbot, and this is still so borne by Lord\r\nTalbot of Malahide: it was recorded at the Visitation of Dublin; but the\r\ncrest at present borne by the Earls of Shrewsbury is derived from the arms\r\ninherited by descent from Gwendolin, daughter of Rhys ap Griffith. The\r\nNevill crest was a bull's head as it is now borne by the Marquess {342} of\r\nAbergavenny, and as it will be seen on the Garter plate of William Nevill,\r\nLord Fauconberg. An elder brother of Lord Fauconberg had married the\r\nheiress of the Earl of Salisbury, and was summoned to Parliament in her\r\nearldom. He quartered her arms, which appear upon his Garter plate and\r\nseal, in the first and fourth quarters of his shield, and adopted her\r\ncrest. A younger son of Sir Richard Nevill, Earl of Salisbury, bore the\r\nsame crest differenced by two annulets conjoined, which was the difference\r\nmark added to the shield. The crest of Bourchier was a soldan's head\r\ncrowned, and with a pointed cap issuing from the crown, but when the barony\r\nof Bourchier passed to the family of Robsart, as will be seen from the\r\nGarter plate of Sir Lewis Robsart, Lord Bourchier, the crest of Bourchier\r\nwas adopted with the inheritance of the arms and Barony of Bourchier.\r\n\r\nI am aware of no important case in English heraldry where the change has\r\nbeen due to mere caprice, and it would seem therefore an almost\r\nincontrovertible assertion that changes were due to inheritance, and if\r\nthat can be established it follows even more strongly that until the days\r\nwhen armory was brought under rigid and official control, and even until a\r\nmuch later date, say up to the beginning of the Stuart period, crests were\r\nheritable through heiresses equally with quarterings. The fact that we find\r\ncomparatively few changes considering the number of crests in existence is\r\nby no means a refutation of this theory, because a man had but one helmet,\r\nand was forced therefore to make a selection. Unless, therefore, he had a\r\nvery strong inclination it would be more likely that he would select the\r\ncrest he was used to than a fresh one. I am by no means certain that to a\r\nlimited extent the German idea did not hold in England. This was, and is,\r\nthat the crest had not the same personal character that was the case with\r\nthe arms, but was rather attached to or an appanage of the territorial fief\r\nor lordship. By the time of the Restoration any idea of the transmission of\r\ncrests through heiresses had been abandoned. We then find a Royal License\r\nnecessary for the assumption of arms and crests. Since that date it has\r\nbeen and at the present time it is stringently held, and is the official\r\nrule, that no woman can bear or inherit a crest, and that no woman can\r\ntransmit a right to one. Whilst that is the official and accepted\r\ninterpretation of heraldic law upon the point, and whilst it cannot now be\r\ngainsaid, it cannot, however, be stated that the one assertion is the\r\nlogical deduction of the other, for whilst a woman cannot inherit a\r\nlordship of Parliament, she undoubtedly can transmit one, together with the\r\ntitular honours, the enjoyment of which is not denied to her.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland crests have always had a very much less important position than\r\nin England. There has been little if any continuity {343} with regard to\r\nthem, and instances of changes for which caprice would appear to be the\r\nonly reason are met with in the cases of a large proportion of the chief\r\nfamilies in that kingdom. To such a widespread extent has the permissive\r\ncharacter been allowed to the crest, that many cases will be found in which\r\neach successive matriculation for the head of the house, or for a cadet,\r\nhas produced a change in the crest, and instances are to be found where the\r\ndifferent crests are the only existing differences in the achievements of a\r\nnumber of cadets of the same family. At the present time, little if any\r\nobjection is ever made to an entire and radical change in the crest--if\r\nthis is wished at the time of a rematriculation--and as far as I can gather\r\nsuch changes appear to have always been permitted. Perhaps it may be well\r\nhere to point out that this is not equivalent to permission to change the\r\ncrest at pleasure, because the patent of matriculation until it is\r\nsuperseded by another is the authority, and the compulsory authority, for\r\nthe crest which is to be borne. In Germany the crest has an infinitely\r\ngreater importance than is the case with ourselves, but it is there\r\nconsidered in a large degree a territorial appanage, and it is by no means\r\nunusual in a German achievement to see several crests surmounting a single\r\ncoat of arms. In England the Royal coat of arms has really three crests,\r\nalthough the crests of Scotland and Ireland are seldom used, which, it may\r\nbe noted, are all in a manner territorial; but the difference of idea with\r\nwhich crests are regarded in Germany may be gathered from the fact that the\r\nKing of Saxony has five, the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin five, the\r\nGrand Duke of Saxe-Meiningen six, the Grand Duke of Saxe-Altenburg seven,\r\nthe Duke of Anhalt seven, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha six, the Prince\r\nof Schwartzburg-Sondershausen six, the Prince of Schwartzburg-Rudolstadt\r\nsix, the Prince of Waldeck-Pyrmont five, the Prince of Lippe five, the Duke\r\nof Brunswick five, and instances can be quoted of sixteen and seventeen.\r\nProbably Woodward is correct when he says that each crest formerly denoted\r\na noble fief, for which the proprietor had a right to vote in the \"circles\"\r\nof the Empire, and he instances the Margraves of Brandenburg-Anspach, who\r\nwere entitled to no less than thirteen crests. In France the use of crests\r\nis not nearly so general as in England or Germany. In Spain and Portugal it\r\nis less frequent still, and in Italy the use of a crest is the exception.\r\n\r\nThe German practice of using horns on either side of the crest, which the\r\nignorance of English heralds has transformed into the proboscides of\r\nelephants, is dealt with at some length on page 214. The horns, which are\r\ntermed buffalo's or bull's horns until the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, were short and thick-set. It is difficult to {344} say at what\r\ndate these figures came to be considered as heraldic _crests_, for as mere\r\nhelmet ornaments they probably can be traced back very far beyond any proof\r\nof the existence of armory. In the fourteenth century we find the horns\r\ncurved inwards like a sickle, but later the horns are found more erect, the\r\npoints turning outwards, slimmer in shape, and finally they exhibit a\r\ndecidedly marked double curve. Then the ends of the horns are met with\r\nopen, like a trumpet, the fact which gave rise to the erroneous idea that\r\nthey represented elephants' trunks. The horns became ornamented with\r\nfeathers, banners, branches of leaves, balls, &c., and the orifices\r\ngarnished with similar adornments.\r\n\r\nIn England, crests are theoretically subject to marks of cadency and\r\ndifference. This is not the case, however, in any other country. In\r\nGermany, in cases where the crests reproduce the arms, any mark of cadency\r\nwith which the arms are distinguished will of course be repeated; but in\r\nGerman heraldry, doubtless owing to the territorial nature of the crest, a\r\nchange in the crest itself is often the only mark of distinction between\r\ndifferent branches of the same family, and in Siebmacher's _Wappenbuch_\r\nthirty-one different branches of the Zorn family have different crests,\r\nwhich are the sole marks of difference in the achievements.\r\n\r\nBut though British crests are presumed to be subject to the recognised\r\nmarks of cadency, as a matter of fact it is very seldom indeed that they\r\nare ever so marked, with the exception that the mark used (usually a cross\r\ncrosslet) to signify the lack of blood relationship when arms are assumed\r\nunder a Royal License, is compulsory. Marks of distinction added to signify\r\nillegitimacy are also compulsory and perpetual. What these marks are will\r\nbe dealt with in a subsequent chapter upon the subject. How very seldom a\r\nmark of difference is added to a crest may be gathered from the fact that\r\nwith the exception of labels, chiefly upon the Royal crest, one crest only\r\namongst the Plantagenet Garter plates is differenced, that one being the\r\ncrest of John Neville, Lord Montague. Several crests, however, which are\r\nnot Royal, are differenced by similar labels to those which appear upon the\r\nshields; but when we find that the difference marks have very much of a\r\npermissive character, even upon the shield, it is not likely that they are\r\nperpetuated upon the crest, where they are even less desirable. The arms of\r\nCokayne, as given in the funeral certificate of Sir William Cokayne, Lord\r\nMayor of London, show upon the shield three crescents, sable, or, and\r\ngules, charged one upon the other, the Lord Mayor being the second son of a\r\nsecond son of Cokayne of Sturston, descending from William, second son of\r\nSir John Cokayne of Ashborne. But, in spite of the fact that three\r\ndifference marks are charged upon the shield (one of the quarterings of\r\nwhich, by the way, {345} has an additional mark), the crest itself is only\r\ndifferenced by one crescent. These difference marks, as applied to arms,\r\nare in England (the rules in Scotland are utterly distinct) practically\r\npermissive, and are never enforced against the wish of the bearer except in\r\none circumstance. If, owing to the grant of a crest or supporters, or a\r\nRoyal License, or any similar opportunity, a formal exemplification of the\r\narms is entered on the books of the College of Arms, the opportunity is\r\ngenerally taken to add such mark of cadency as may be necessary; and no\r\ncertificate would be officially issued to any one claiming arms through\r\nthat exemplification except subject to the mark of cadency therein\r\ndepicted. In such cases as these the crest is usually differenced, because\r\nthe necessity for an exemplification does not often occur, except owing to\r\nthe establishment of an important branch of the family, which is likely to\r\ncontinue as a separate house in the future, and possibly to rival the\r\nimportance of the chief of the name. Two examples will show my meaning. The\r\ncrest of the Duke of Bedford is a goat statant argent, armed or. When Earl\r\nRussell, the third son of the sixth Duke of Bedford, was so created, the\r\narms, crest, and supporters were charged with a mullet argent. When the\r\nfirst Lord Ampthill, who was the third son of the father of the ninth Duke\r\nof Bedford, was so created, the arms of Russell, with the crest and\r\nsupporters, were also charged with mullets, these being of different\r\ntinctures from those granted to Earl Russell. The crest of the Duke of\r\nWestminster is a talbot statant or. The first Lord Stalbridge was the\r\nsecond son of the Marquess of Westminster. His arms, crest, and supporters\r\nwere charged with a crescent. Lord Ebury was the third son of the first\r\nMarquess of Westminster. His arms, crest, and supporters were charged with\r\na mullet. In cases of this kind the mark of difference upon the crest would\r\nbe considered permanent; but for ordinary purposes, and in ordinary\r\ncircumstances, the rule may be taken to be that it is not necessary to add\r\nthe mark of cadency to a crest, even when it is added to the shield, but\r\nthat, at the same time, it is not incorrect to do so.\r\n\r\nCrests must nowadays always be depicted upon either a wreath, coronet, or\r\nchapeau; but these, and the rules concerning them, will be considered in a\r\nmore definite and detailed manner in the separate chapters in which those\r\nobjects are discussed.\r\n\r\nCrests are nowadays very frequently used upon livery buttons. Such a usage\r\nis discussed at some length in the chapter on badges.\r\n\r\nWhen two or more crests are depicted together, and when, as is often the\r\ncase in England, the wreaths are depicted in space, and without the\r\nintervening helmets, the crests always all face to the dexter side, and the\r\nstereotyped character of English crests perhaps more than any other reason,\r\nhas led of late to the depicting of English {346} helmets all placed to\r\nface in the same direction to the dexter side. But if, as will often be\r\nfound, the two helmets are turned to face each other, the crests also must\r\nbe turned.\r\n\r\nWhere there are two crests, the one on the dexter side is the first and the\r\none on the sinister side is the second. When there are three, the centre\r\none comes first, then the one on the dexter side, then the one on the\r\nsinister. When there are four crests, the first one is the dexter of the\r\ntwo inner ones; the second is the sinister inner one; the third is the\r\ndexter outer, and the fourth the sinister outer. When there are five (and I\r\nknow of no greater number in this country), they run as follows: (1)\r\ncentre, (2) dexter inner, (3) sinister inner, (4) dexter outer, (5)\r\nsinister outer.\r\n\r\nA very usual practice in official emblazonments in cases of three crests is\r\nto paint the centre one of a larger size, and at a slightly lower level,\r\nthan the others. In the case of four, Nos. 1 and 2 would be of the same\r\nsize, Nos. 3 and 4 slightly smaller, and slightly raised.\r\n\r\nIt is a very usual circumstance to see two or more crests displayed in\r\nEngland, but this practice is of comparatively recent date. How recent may\r\nbe gathered from the fact that in Scotland no single instance can be found\r\nbefore the year 1809 in which two crests are placed above the same shield.\r\nScottish heraldry, however, has always been purer than English, and the\r\npractice in England is much more ancient, though I question if in England\r\nany authentic official exemplification can be found before 1700. There are,\r\nhowever, many cases in the Visitation Books in which two crests are allowed\r\nto the same family, but this fact does not prove the point, because a\r\nVisitation record is merely an official record of inheritance and\r\npossession, and not necessarily evidence of a regulation permitting the\r\nsimultaneous display of more than one. It is of course impossible to use\r\ntwo sets of supporters with a single shield, but there are many peers who\r\nare entitled to two sets; Lord Ancaster, I believe, is entitled to three\r\nsets. But an official record in such a case would probably emblazon both\r\nsets as evidence of right, by painting the shield twice over.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century we find many instances of the grant of\r\nadditional crests of augmentation, and many exemplifications under Royal\r\nLicense for the use of two and three crests. Since that day the correctness\r\nof duplicate crests has never been questioned, where the right of\r\ninheritance to them has been established. The right of inheritance to two\r\nor more crests at the present time is only officially allowed in the\r\nfollowing cases.\r\n\r\nIf a family at the time of the Visitations had two crests recorded to them,\r\nthese would be now allowed. If descent can be proved from a family to whom\r\na certain crest was allowed, and also from ancestors {347} at an earlier\r\ndate who are recorded as entitled to bear a different crest, the two would\r\nbe allowed unless it was evident that the later crest had been granted,\r\nassigned, or exemplified _in lieu_ of the earlier one. Two crests are\r\nallowed in the few cases which exist where a family has obtained a grant of\r\narms in ignorance of the fact that they were then entitled to bear arms and\r\ncrest of an earlier date to which the right has been subsequently proved,\r\nbut on this point it should be remarked that if a right to arms is known to\r\nexist a second grant in England is point-blank refused unless the petition\r\nasks for it to be borne instead of, and in lieu of, the earlier one: it is\r\nthen granted in those terms.\r\n\r\nTo those who think that the Heralds' College is a mere fee-grabbing\r\ninstitution, the following experience of an intimate friend of mine may be\r\nof interest. In placing his pedigree upon record it became evident that his\r\ndescent was not legitimate, and he therefore petitioned for and obtained a\r\nRoyal License to bear the name and arms of the family from which he had\r\nsprung. But the illegitimacy was not modern, and no one would have\r\nquestioned his right to the name which all the other members of the family\r\nbear, if he had not himself raised the point in order to obtain the ancient\r\narms in the necessarily differenced form. The arms had always been borne\r\nwith some four or five quarterings and with two crests, and he was rather\r\nannoyed that he had to go back to a simple coat of arms and single crest.\r\nHe obtained a grant for his wife, who was an heiress, and then, with the\r\nidea of obtaining an additional quartering and a second crest, he conceived\r\nthe brilliant idea--for money was of no object to him--of putting his\r\nbrother forward as a petitioner for arms to be granted to him and his\r\ndescendants and to the other descendants of his father, a grant which would\r\nof course have brought in my friend. He moved heaven and earth to bring\r\nthis about, but he was met with the direct statement that two grants of\r\narms could not be made to the same man to be borne simultaneously, and that\r\nif he persisted in the grant of arms to his brother, his own name, as being\r\nthen entitled to bear arms, would be specifically exempted from the later\r\ngrant, and the result was that this second grant was never made.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, where re-matriculation is constantly going on, two separate\r\nmatriculations _to the same line_ would not confer the right to two crests,\r\ninasmuch as the last matriculation supersedes everything which has preceded\r\nit. But if a cadet matriculates a different crest, _and subsequently_\r\nsucceeds to the representation under an earlier matriculation, he legally\r\nsucceeds to both crests, and incidentally to both coats of arms. As a\r\nmatter of ordinary practice, the cadet matriculation is discarded. A\r\ncurious case, however, occurs when after {348} matriculation by a cadet\r\nthere is a _later_ matriculation behind it, by some one nearer the head of\r\nthe house to which the first-mentioned cadet succeeds; in which event\r\nselection must be brought into play, when succession to both occurs. But\r\nthe selection lies only between the two patents, and not from varied\r\nconstituent parts.\r\n\r\nWhere as an augmentation an additional crest is granted, as has been the\r\ncase in many instances, of course a right to the double crest is thereby\r\nconferred, and a crest of augmentation is not granted in lieu, but in\r\naddition.\r\n\r\nA large number of these additional crests have been granted under specific\r\nwarrants from the Crown, and in the case of Lord Gough, two additional\r\ncrests were granted as separate augmentations and under separate patents.\r\nLord Kitchener recently received a grant of an additional crest of\r\naugmentation. There are also a number of grants on record, not officially\r\nranking as augmentations, in which a second crest has been granted as a\r\nmemorial of descent or office, &c.\r\n\r\nThe other cases in which double and treble crests occur are the results of\r\nexemplifications following upon Royal Licenses to assume name and arms. As\r\na rule, when an additional surname is adopted by Royal License, the rule is\r\nthat the arms adopted are to be borne in addition to those previously in\r\nexistence; and where one name is adopted instead of another the warrant\r\nvery frequently permits this, and at the same time permits or requires the\r\nnew arms to be borne quarterly with those previously possessed, and gives\r\nthe right to two crests. But in cases where names and arms are assumed by\r\nRoyal License the arms and crest or crests are in accordance with the\r\npatent of exemplification, which, no matter what its terms (for some do not\r\nexpressly exclude any prior rights), is always presumed to supersede\r\neverything which has gone before, and to be the authority by which the\r\nsubsequent bearing of arms is regularised and controlled. Roughly speaking,\r\nunder a Royal License one generally gets the right to one crest for every\r\nsurname, and if the original surname be discarded, in addition a crest for\r\nevery previous surname. Thus Mainwaring-Ellerker-Onslow has three crests,\r\nWyndham-Campbell-Pleydell-Bouverie has four, and the last Duke of\r\nBuckingham and Chandos, who held the record, had one for each of his\r\nsurnames, namely, Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville. In addition to\r\nthe foregoing, there are one or two exceptions which it is difficult to\r\nexplain. The Marquess of Bute for some reason or other obtained a grant, in\r\nthe year 1822, of the crest of Herbert. The original Lord Liverpool\r\nobtained a grant of an additional crest, possibly an augmentation, and his\r\nrepresentative, Lord Hawkesbury, afterwards created Earl of Liverpool, for\r\nsome reason or other which I am quite at a loss to understand, obtained a\r\ngrant of a crest {349} very similar to that of Lord Liverpool to\r\ncommemorate the representation which had devolved upon him. He subsequently\r\nobtained a grant of a third crest, this last being of augmentation. Sir\r\nCharles Young, Garter King of Arms, obtained the grant of a second crest,\r\nand a former Marquess of Camden did the same thing; Lord Swansea is another\r\nrecent case, and though the right of any person to obtain the grant of a\r\nsecond crest is not officially admitted, and is in fact strenuously denied,\r\nI cannot for the life of me see how in the face of the foregoing precedents\r\nany such privilege can be denied. Sir William Woods also obtained the grant\r\nof a second crest when he was Garter, oblivious of the fact that he had not\r\nreally established a right to arms. Those he used were certainly granted in\r\nLyon Office to a relative, but no matriculation of them in his own name was\r\never registered. {350}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nCROWNS AND CORONETS\r\n\r\nThe origin of the crown or coronet is, of course, to be met with in the\r\ndiadem and fillet. In one of the Cantor Lectures delivered by Mr. Cyril\r\nDavenport, F.S.A., in February 1902, on \"The History of Personal Jewellery\r\nfrom Prehistoric Times,\" he devoted considerable attention to the\r\ndevelopment of the diadem, and the following extracts are from the printed\r\nreport of his lecture:--\r\n\r\n\"The bandeau or fillet tied round the head was probably first used to keep\r\nlong hair from getting into the eyes of primitive man. Presently it became\r\nspecialised, priests wearing one pattern and fighting men another.\r\n\r\n\"The soft band which can be seen figured on the heads of kings in early\r\ncoins, is no doubt a mark of chieftainship. This use of a band, of special\r\ncolour, to indicate authority, probably originated in the East. It was\r\nadopted by Alexander the Great, who also used the diadem of the King of\r\nPersia. Justinian says that Alexander's predecessors did not wear any\r\ndiadem. Justinian also tells us that the diadems then worn were of some\r\nsoft material, as in describing the accidental wounding of Lysimachus by\r\nAlexander, he says that the hurt was bound up by Alexander _with his own\r\ndiadem_. This was considered a lucky omen for Lysimachus, who actually did\r\nshortly afterwards become King of Thrace.\r\n\r\n\"In Egypt diadems of particular shape are of very ancient use. There were\r\ncrowns for Upper and Lower Egypt, and a combination of both for the whole\r\ncountry. They were also distinguished by colour. The Uraeus or snake worn\r\nin the crowns and head-dresses of the Pharaohs was a symbol of royalty.\r\nRepresentations of the Egyptian gods always show them as wearing crowns.\r\n\r\n\"In Assyrian sculptures deities and kings are shown wearing diadems,\r\napparently bands of stuff or leather studded with discs of _repoussé_ work.\r\nSome of these discs, detached, have actually been found. Similar discs were\r\nplentifully found at Mycenæ, which were very likely used in a similar way.\r\nSome of the larger ornamental head-dresses worn by Assyrian kings appear to\r\nhave been conical-shaped helmets, or perhaps crowns; it is now difficult to\r\nsay which, {351} because the material of which they were made cannot be\r\nascertained. If they were of gold, they were probably crowns, like the\r\nwonderful openwork golden Scythian head-dress found at Kertch, but if of an\r\ninferior metal they may have been only helmets.\r\n\r\n\"At St. Petersburg there is a beautiful ancient Greek diadem representing a\r\ncrown of olive. An Etruscan ivy wreath of thin gold, still encircling a\r\nbronze helmet, is in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\"Justinian says that Morimus tried to hang himself with the diadem,\r\nevidently a ribbon-like bandeau, sent to him by Mithridates. The Roman\r\nroyal diadem was originally a white ribbon, a wreath of laurel was the\r\nreward of distinguished citizens, while a circlet of golden leaves was\r\ngiven to successful generals.\r\n\r\n\"Cæsar consistently refused the royal white diadem which Antony offered\r\nhim, preferring to remain perpetual dictator. One of his partisans ventured\r\nto crown Cæsar's bust with a coronet of laurel tied with royal white\r\nribbon, but the tribunes quickly removed it and heavily punished the\r\nperpetrator of the offence.\r\n\r\n\"During the Roman Empire the prejudice against the white bandeau remained\r\nstrong. The emperors dared not wear it. Caligula wished to do so, but was\r\ndissuaded on being told that such a proceeding might cost his life.\r\nEliogabalus used to wear a diadem studded with precious stones, but it is\r\nnot supposed to have indicated rank, but only to have been a rich lady's\r\nparure, this emperor being fond of dressing himself up as a woman.\r\nCaracalla, who took Alexander the Great as his model as far as possible, is\r\nshown on some of his coins wearing a diadem of a double row of pearls, a\r\nsimilar design to which was used by the kings of Parthia. On coins of\r\nDiocletian, there shows a double row of pearls, sewn on a double band and\r\ntied in a knot at the back.\r\n\r\n\"Diadems gradually closed in and became crowns, and on Byzantine coins\r\nhighly ornate diadems can be recognised, and there are many beautiful\r\nrepresentations of them in enamels and mosaics, as well as a few actual\r\nspecimens. At Ravenna, in mosaic work in the church of San Vitale, are\r\ncrowned portraits of Justinian and his Empress Theodosia; in the enamel\r\nportrait of the Empress Irene in the Pal d'Oro at Venice, can be seen a\r\nbeautiful jewelled crown with hinged plaques, and the same construction is\r\nused on the iron crown of Lombardy, the sacred crown of Hungary, and the\r\ncrown of Charlemagne, all most beautiful specimens of jewellers' work.\r\n\r\n\"On the plaques of the crown of Constantine Monomachos are also fine enamel\r\nportraits of himself and his queen Zoë, wearing similar crowns. The\r\ncataseistas, or jewelled chains, one over each ear and one at the back,\r\nwhich occur on all these crowns, may be the survival of the loose ends of\r\nthe tie of the original fillet. {352}\r\n\r\n\"In later times of Greece and Rome, owing to the growth of republican\r\nfeeling the diadem lost its political significance, and was relegated to\r\nthe ladies.\r\n\r\n\"In the Middle Ages the diadem regained much of its earlier significance,\r\nand ceased to be only the simple head ornament it had become. Now it became\r\nspecialised in form, reserved as an emblem of rank. The forms of royal\r\ncrowns and diadems is a large and fascinating study, and where original\r\nexamples do not now exist, the development can often be followed in\r\nsculpture, coins, or seals. Heraldry now plays an important part. Diadems\r\nor circlets gradually give way to closed crowns, in the case of sovereigns\r\npossessing independent authority.\"\r\n\r\nBut to pass to the crown proper, there is no doubt that from the earliest\r\ntimes of recorded history crowns have been a sign and emblem of\r\nsovereignty. It equally admits of no doubt that the use of a crown or\r\ncoronet was by no means exclusive to a sovereign, but whilst our knowledge\r\nis somewhat curtailed as to the exact relation in which great overlords and\r\nnobles stood to their sovereign, it is difficult to draw with any certainty\r\nor exactitude definitive conclusions of the symbolism a crown or coronet\r\nconveyed. Throughout Europe in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth, and\r\nwell into the fourteenth centuries, the great territorial lords enjoyed and\r\nexercised many--in fact most--of the attributes of sovereignty, and in\r\nEngland especially, where the king was no more than the first amongst his\r\npeers, the territorial earls were in much the position of petty sovereigns.\r\nIt is only natural, therefore, that we should find them using this emblem\r\nof sovereignty. But what we do find in England is that a coronet or fillet\r\nwas used, apparently without let or hindrance, by even knights. It is,\r\nhowever, a matter for thought as to whether many of these fillets were not\r\nsimply the turban or \"puggaree\" folded into the shape of a fillet, but\r\ncapable of being unrolled if desired. What the object of the wholesale\r\nwearing of crowns and coronets was, it is difficult to conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe development of the crown of the English sovereigns has been best told\r\nby Mr. Cyril Davenport in his valuable work on \"The English Regalia\" (Kegan\r\nPaul, Trench, Trübner & Co.). Mr. Davenport, whose knowledge on these\r\nmatters is probably unequalled, may best be allowed to tell the story in\r\nhis own words, he and his publishers having very kindly permitted this\r\ncourse to be taken:-- {353}\r\n\r\nTHE CROWN OF GREAT BRITAIN\r\n\r\nBY CYRIL DAVENPORT, F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\"Crowns appear to have been at an early period worn by kings in battle, in\r\norder that they might be easily recognised; and although it is quite\r\npossible that this outward sign of sovereignty may have marked the wearer\r\nas being entitled to special protection by his own men, it is also likely\r\nthat it was often a dangerous sign of importance. Upon the authority of\r\ntheir coins, the heads of the early British kings were adorned with\r\nvariously formed fillets and ornamental wreaths. Helmets are also evidently\r\nintended to be shown, and on some of the coins of Athelstan the helmet\r\nbears upon it a crown of three raised points, with a single pearl at the\r\ntop of each (Fig. 619). Other coins bear the crown with the three raised\r\npoints without the helmet (Fig. 620). This crown of three points, bearing\r\nsometimes one and sometimes three pearls at the top of each, continued to\r\nbe used by all the sole monarchs until Canute, on whose head a crown is\r\nshown in which the three points develop into three clearly-marked trefoils\r\n(Fig. 621). On the great seal of Edward the Confessor the king is wearing\r\nan ornamental cap, which is described by Mr. Wyon in his book about the\r\nGreat Seals as bearing a crown with three points trefoiled; but the\r\nimpressions of this Great Seal that I have been able to see are so\r\nindistinct in this particular that I do not feel justified in corroborating\r\nhis opinion. On some of the coins, however, of Edward the Confessor, an\r\narched crown is very clearly shown, and this crown has depending from it,\r\non each side, tassels with ornamental ends (Fig. 622).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 619.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 620.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 621.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 622.]\r\n\r\n\"In the list of the English regalia which were destroyed under the\r\nCommonwealth in 1649 is found an item of great interest, viz. 'a gold wyer\r\nwork crown with little bells,' which is there stated to have belonged to\r\nKing Alfred, who appears to have been the first English king for whom the\r\nceremony of coronation was used; and it is remarkable that on several of\r\nthe crowns on coins and seals, from the time of Edward the Confessor until\r\nHenry I., little tassels or tags are shown which may indeed represent\r\nlittle bells suspended by a ribbon.\r\n\r\n\"On King Alfred's own coins there is unfortunately nothing which can be\r\nrecognised as a crown. {354}\r\n\r\n\"On the coins of Henry II. a crown is shown with arches, apparently\r\nintended to be jewelled, as is also the rim. There are also tassels with\r\nornamental ends at the back of the crown (Fig. 623).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 623.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 624.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 625.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 626.]\r\n\r\n\"William I. on his Great Seal wears a crown with three points, at the top\r\nof each of which are three pearls (Fig. 624), and on some of his coins a\r\nmore ornamental form of crown occurs having a broad jewelled rim and two\r\narches, also apparently jewelled, and at each side are two pendants with\r\npearl ends (Fig. 625). William II. on his Great Seal has a crown with five\r\npoints (Fig. 626), the centre one being slightly bigger than the others,\r\nand at the top of each a single pearl. At each side of the crown are\r\npendants having three pearls at the ends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 627.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 628.]\r\n\r\n\"On some of the coins of Stephen a pretty form of crown is seen. It has\r\nthree fleurs-de-lis and two jewelled arches (Fig. 627). The arches\r\ndisappear from this time until the reign of Edward IV. On the Great Seal of\r\nHenry I. the king wears a simple crown with three fleurs-de-lis points, and\r\ntwo pendants each with three pearls at the ends (Fig. 628), and after this\r\nthe pendants seem to have been discontinued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 629.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 630.]\r\n\r\n\"On the first Great Seal of Henry III. a crown with three fleurs-de-lis is\r\nshown surmounting a barred helmet (Fig. 629), and Edward I. wore a similar\r\ncrown with three fleurs-de-lis, but having supplementary pearls between\r\neach (Fig. 630), and this form lasted for a long time, as modifications of\r\nit are found on the coins of all the kings till Henry VII. On the third\r\nGreat Seal of Edward IV. the king wears a crown with five fleurs-de-lis,\r\nthe centre one being larger than the others, and the crown is arched and\r\nhas at the top an orb and cross (Fig. 631). Henry VI. on his first seal for\r\nforeign affairs, on which occurs the English shield, uses above it a crown\r\nwith three crosses-patée and between each a pearl (Fig. 632), this being\r\nthe first distinct use of the cross-patée on the English crown; and it\r\nprobably was used here in place of the fleurs-de-lis hitherto worn in order\r\nto {355} make a clear distinction between it and the French crown, which\r\nhas the fleurs-de-lis only and surmounts the coat of arms of that country.\r\nThe king himself wears an arched crown, but the impressions are so bad that\r\nthe details of it cannot be followed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 631.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 632.]\r\n\r\n\"Henry VII. on his Great Seal uses as ornaments for the crown,\r\ncrosses-patée alternately with fleurs-de-lis, and also arches with an orb\r\nand cross at the top (Fig. 633) and, on some of his coins, he reverts to\r\nthe three fleurs-de-lis with points between them, arches being still used,\r\nwith the orb and cross at the top (Fig. 634). An ornamental form of crown\r\nbearing five ornamental leaves alternately large and small, with arches,\r\norb, and cross at the top (Fig. 635), occurs on the shillings of Henry VII.\r\nOn the crowns of Henry VIII., as well as upon his Great Seals, the\r\nalternate crosses-patée and fleurs-de-lis are found on the rim of the\r\ncrown, which is arched, and has an orb and cross at the top, and this is\r\nthe form that has remained ever since (Fig. 636). So we may consider that\r\nthe growth of the ornament on the rim of the crown has followed a regular\r\nsequence from the points with one pearl at the top, of Æthelstan, to the\r\ntrefoil of Canute; the arches began with Edward the Confessor, and the\r\ncentre trefoil turned into the cross-patée of Henry VI. The fact that the\r\nremaining trefoils turned eventually into fleurs-de-lis is only, I think, a\r\nnatural expansion of form, and does not appear to have had anything to do\r\nwith the French fleur-de-lis, which was adopted as an heraldic bearing for\r\nan entirely different reason. The Royal coat of arms of England did bear\r\nfor a long time in one of its quarterings the actual fleurs-de-lis of\r\nFrance, and this, no doubt, has given some reason to the idea that the\r\nfleurs-de-lis on the crown had also something to do with France; but as a\r\nmatter of fact they had existed on the crown of England long anterior to\r\nour use of them on the coat of arms, as well as remaining there\r\nsubsequently to their discontinuance on our Royal escutcheon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 633.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 634.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 635.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 636.]\r\n\r\n\"The cross-patée itself may possibly have been evolved in a somewhat\r\nsimilar way from the three pearls of William I., as we often find the\r\ncentre trefoil, into which, as we have seen, these three points eventually\r\n{356} turned, has a tendency to become larger than the others, and this\r\ndifference has been easily made more apparent by squaring the ends of the\r\ntriple leaf. At the same time it must not be forgotten that the cross-patée\r\nwas actually used on the sceptre of Edward the Confessor, so it is just\r\npossible it may have had some specially English significance.\r\n\r\n\"I have already mentioned that as well as the official crown of England,\r\nwhich alone I have just been describing, there has often been a second or\r\nState crown, and this, although it has in general design followed the\r\npattern of the official crown, has been much more elaborately ornamented,\r\nand in it has been set and reset the few historic gems possessed by our\r\nnation. The fact that these State crowns have in turn been denuded of their\r\njewels accounts for the fact that the old settings of some of them still\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 637.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 638.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 639.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 640.]\r\n\r\n\"Charles II.'s State Crown is figured in Sir Edward Walker's account of his\r\ncoronation, but the illustration of it is of such an elementary character\r\nthat little reliance can be placed on it; the actual setting of this crown,\r\nhowever--which was the one stolen by Colonel Blood on May 13, 1671--is now\r\nthe property of Lord Amherst of Hackney, and the spaces from which the\r\ngreat ruby and the large sapphire--both of which are now in King Edward's\r\nState crown--have been taken are clearly seen (Fig. 637). James II.'s State\r\nCrown, which is very accurately figured in Sandford's account of his\r\ncoronation, and pieces of which are still in the Tower, also had this great\r\nruby as its centre ornament (Fig. 638). In Sir George Nayler's account of\r\nthe coronation of George IV. there is a figure of his so-called 'new\r\ncrown,' the arches of which are composed of oak-leaf sprays with acorns,\r\nand the rim adorned with laurel sprays (Fig. 639). The setting of this\r\ncrown also belongs to Lord Amherst of Hackney, and so does another setting\r\nof a small State queen's crown, the ownership of which is doubtful. William\r\nIV. appears to have had a very beautiful State crown, with arches of laurel\r\nsprays and a cross at the top with large diamonds. It is figured in\r\nRobson's 'British Herald,' published in 1830 (Fig. 640).\r\n\r\n\"There is one other crown of great interest, which, since the time {357} of\r\nJames Sixth of Scotland and First of England, forms part of our regalia.\r\nThis is the crown of Scotland, and is the most ancient piece of State\r\njewellery of which we can boast.\r\n\r\n\"Edward I., after his defeat of John Baliol in 1296, carried off the crown\r\nof Scotland to England, and Robert Bruce had another made for himself. This\r\nin its turn, after Bruce's defeat at Methven, fell into Edward's hands.\r\nAnother crown seems to have been made for Bruce in 1314, when he was\r\nestablished in the sovereignty of Scotland after Bannockburn, and the\r\npresent crown probably consists largely of the material of the old one, and\r\nmost likely follows its general design. It has, however, much French work\r\nabout it, as well as the rougher gold work made by Scottish jewellers, and\r\nit seems probable that the crown, as it now is, is a reconstruction by\r\nFrench workmen, made under the care and by order of James V. about 1540. It\r\nwas with this crown that Queen Mary was crowned when she was nine months\r\nold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 641.]\r\n\r\n\"In 1661 the Scottish regalia were considered to be in danger from the\r\nEnglish, and were sent to Dunnottar Castle for safety. From 1707 until 1818\r\nthey were locked up in a strong chest in the Crown-Room of Edinburgh\r\nCastle, and Sir Walter Scott, in whose presence the box was opened, wrote\r\nan account of them in 1810. The crown consists of a fillet of gold bordered\r\nwith flat wire. Upon it are twenty-two large stones set at equal distances,\r\n_i.e._ nine carbuncles, four jacinths, four amethysts, two white topazes,\r\ntwo crystals with green foil behind them, and one topaz with yellow foil.\r\nBehind each of these gems is a gold plate, with bands above and below of\r\nwhite enamel with black spots, and between each stone is a pearl. Above the\r\nband are ten jewelled rosettes and ten fleurs-de-lis alternately, and\r\nbetween each a pearl. Under the rosettes and fleurs-de-lis are jewels of\r\nblue enamel and pearls alternately. The arches have enamelled leaves of\r\nFrench work in red and gold upon them, and the mount at the top is of blue\r\nenamel studded with gold stars. The cross at the top is black enamel with\r\ngold arabesque patterns; in the centre is an amethyst, and in this cross\r\nand in the corners are Oriental pearls set in gold. At the back of the\r\ncross are the letters I. R. V. in enamel-work. On the velvet cap are four\r\nlarge pearls in settings of gold and enamel (Fig. 641).\r\n\r\n\"Generally, the Scottish work in gold is cast solid and chased, the foreign\r\nwork being thinner and _repoussé_. Several of the diamonds are undoubtedly\r\nold, and are cut in the ancient Oriental fashion; and many of the pearls\r\nare Scottish. It is kept in Edinburgh Castle with the rest of the Scottish\r\nregalia. None of the other pieces at all equal it in interest, as with the\r\nexception of the coronation ring of Charles I. {358} they are of foreign\r\nworkmanship, or, at all events, have been so altered that there is little\r\nor no original work left upon them.\"\r\n\r\nVery few people are aware, when they speak of the crown of England, that\r\nthere are two crowns. The one is the official crown, the sign and symbol of\r\nthe sovereigns of England. This is known by the name of St. Edward's Crown,\r\nand is never altered or changed. As to this Mr. Cyril Davenport writes:--\r\n\r\n\"St. Edward's crown was made for the coronation of Charles II. in 1662, by\r\nSir Robert Vyner. It was ordered to be made as nearly as possible after the\r\nold pattern, and the designs of it that have been already mentioned as\r\nexisting in the works of Sir Edward Walker and Francis Sandford show that\r\nin a sensual form it was the same as now; indeed, the existing crown is in\r\nall probability mainly composed of the same materials as that made by Sir\r\nRobert. The crown consists of a rim or circlet of gold, adorned with\r\nrosettes of precious stones surrounded with diamonds, and set upon enamel\r\narabesques of white and red. The centre gems of these rosettes are rubies,\r\nemeralds, and sapphires. Rows of large pearls mark the upper and lower\r\nedges of the rim, from which rise the four crosses-patée and four\r\nfleurs-de-lis alternately, adorned with diamonds and other gems. The gem\r\nclusters upon the crosses are set upon enamel arabesques in white and red,\r\nof similar workmanship to that upon the rim. From the tops of the crosses\r\nrise two complete arches of gold crossing each other, and curving deeply\r\ndownwards at the point of intersection. The arches are considered to be the\r\nmark of independent sovereignty. They are edged with rows of large pearls,\r\nand have gems and clusters of gems upon them set in arabesques of red and\r\nwhite, like those upon the crosses. From the intersection of the arches\r\nsprings a mound of gold, encircled by a fillet from which rises a single\r\narch, both of which are ornamented with pearls and gems. On the top of the\r\narch is a cross-patée of gold, set in which are coloured gems and diamonds.\r\nAt the top of the cross is a large spheroidal pearl, and from each of the\r\nside arms, depending from a little gold bracelet, is a beautifully formed\r\npear-shaped pearl. The crown is shown in the Tower with the crimson velvet\r\ncap, turned up with miniver, which would be worn with it.\r\n\r\n\"This crown is very large, but whether it is actually worn or not it would\r\nalways be present at the coronation, as it is the 'official' crown of\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Edward's crown is the crown supposed to be heraldically represented\r\nwhen for State or official purposes the crown is represented over the Royal\r\nArms or other insignia. In this the fleurs-de-lis upon the rim are only\r\nhalf fleurs-de-lis. This detail is scrupulously adhered to, but during the\r\nreign of Queen Victoria many of the other details {359} were very much \"at\r\nthe mercy\" of the artist. Soon after the accession of King Edward VII. the\r\nmatter was brought under consideration, and the opportunity afforded by the\r\nissue of a War Office Sealed Pattern of the Royal Crown and Cypher for use\r\nin the army was taken advantage of to notify his Majesty's pleasure, that\r\nfor official purposes the Royal Crown should be as shown in Fig. 642, which\r\nis a reproduction of the War Office Sealed Pattern already mentioned. It\r\nshould be noted that whilst the cap of the real crown is of _purple_\r\nvelvet, the cap of the _heraldic_ crown is _always_ represented as of\r\ncrimson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 642.--Royal Crown.]\r\n\r\nThe second crown is what is known as the \"Imperial State Crown.\" This is\r\nthe one which is actually worn, and which the Sovereign after the ceremony\r\nof his coronation wears in the procession from the Abbey. It is also\r\ncarried before the Sovereign at the opening of Parliament. Whilst the gems\r\nwhich are set in it are national property, the crown is usually remade for\r\neach successive sovereign. The following is Mr. Davenport's description of\r\nQueen Victoria's State Crown:--\r\n\r\n\"This beautiful piece of jewellery was made by Roundell & Bridge in 1838.\r\nMany of the gems in it are old ones reset, and many of them are new. The\r\nentire weight of the crown is 39 ozs. 5 dwts. It consists of a circlet of\r\nopen work in silver, bearing in the front the great sapphire from the crown\r\nof Charles II. which was bequeathed to George III. by Cardinal York, with\r\nother Stuart treasure. At one end this gem is partly pierced. It is not a\r\nthick stone, but it is a fine colour. Opposite to the large sapphire is one\r\nof smaller size. The remainder of the rim is filled in with rich jewel\r\nclusters having alternately sapphires and emeralds in their centres,\r\nenclosed in ornamental borders thickly set with diamonds. These clusters\r\nare separated from each other by trefoil designs also thickly set with\r\ndiamonds. The rim is bordered above and below with bands of large pearls,\r\n129 in the lower row, and 112 in the upper. [The crown as remade for King\r\nEdward VII. now has 139 pearls in the lower row, and 122 in the upper.]\r\nAbove the rim are shallow festoons of diamonds caught up between the larger\r\nornaments by points of emeralds encircled with diamonds, and a large pearl\r\nabove each. On these festoons are set alternately eight crosses-patée, and\r\neight fleurs-de-lis of silver set with gems. The crosses-patée are thickly\r\nset with brilliants, and have each an emerald in the centre, except that in\r\nfront of the crown, which {360} contains the most remarkable jewel\r\nbelonging to the regalia. This is a large spinal ruby of irregular\r\ndrop-like form, measuring about 2 ins. in length, and is highly polished on\r\nwhat is probably its natural surface, or nearly so. Its irregular outline\r\nmakes it possible to recognise the place that it has formerly occupied in\r\nthe older State crowns, and it seems always to have been given the place of\r\nhonour. It is pierced after an Oriental fashion, and the top of the\r\npiercing is filled with a supplementary ruby set in gold. Don Pedro, King\r\nof Castille in 1367, murdered the King of Granada for the sake of his\r\njewels, one of which was this stone, and Don Pedro is said to have given it\r\nto Edward the Black Prince after the battle of Najera, near Vittoria, in\r\nthe same year. After this, it is said to have been worn by Henry V. in his\r\ncrown at Agincourt in 1415, when it is recorded that the King's life was\r\nsaved from the attack of the Duc D'Alençon, because of the protection\r\nafforded him by his crown, a portion of which, however, was broken off. It\r\nmay be confidently predicted that such a risk of destruction is not very\r\nlikely to happen again to the great ruby.\r\n\r\n\"In the centre of each of the very ornamental fleurs-de-lis is a ruby, and\r\nall the rest of the ornamentation on them is composed of rose diamonds,\r\nlarge and small. From each of the crosses-patée, the upper corners of which\r\nhave each a large pearl upon them, rises an arch of silver worked into a\r\ndesign of oak-leaves and acorn-cups. These leaves and cups are all closely\r\nencrusted with a mass of large and small diamonds, rose brilliant, and\r\ntable-cut; the acorns themselves formed of beautiful drop-shaped pearls of\r\nlarge size. From the four points of intersection of the arches at the top\r\nof the crown depend large egg-shaped pearls. From the centre of the arches,\r\nwhich slope slightly downwards, springs a mound with a cross-patée above\r\nit. The mound is ornamented all over with close lines of brilliant\r\ndiamonds, and the fillet which encircles it, and the arch which crosses\r\nover it, are both ornamented with one line of large rose-cut diamonds set\r\nclosely together. The cross-patée at the top has in the centre a large\r\nsapphire of magnificent colour set openly. The outer lines of the arms of\r\nthe cross are marked by a row of small diamonds close together and in the\r\ncentre of each arm is a large diamond, the remaining spaces being filled\r\nwith more small diamonds. The large sapphire in the centre of this cross is\r\nsaid to have come out of the ring of Edward the Confessor, which was buried\r\nwith him in his shrine at Westminster, and the possession of it is supposed\r\nto give to the owner the power of curing the cramp. If this be indeed the\r\nstone which belonged to St. Edward, it was probably recut in its present\r\nform of a 'rose' for Charles II., even if not since his time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 643.--Queen Alexandra's Coronation Crown.]\r\n\r\n\"Not counting the large ruby or the large sapphire, this crown {361}\r\ncontains: Four rubies, eleven emeralds, sixteen sapphires, 277 pearls, 2783\r\ndiamonds. [As remade for King Edward VII. the crown now has 297 pearls and\r\n2818 diamonds.]\r\n\r\n\"The large ruby has been valued at £110,000.\r\n\r\n\"When this crown has to take a journey it is provided with a little casket,\r\nlined with white velvet, and having a sliding drawer at the bottom, with a\r\nboss on which the crown fits closely, so that it is safe from slipping. The\r\nvelvet cap turned up with miniver, with which it is worn, is kept with it.\"\r\n\r\nThis crown has been recently remade for King Edward VII., but has not been\r\naltered in any essential details. The cap of the real crown is of purple\r\nvelvet.\r\n\r\nFig. 643 represents the crown of the Queen Consort with which Queen\r\nAlexandra was crowned on August 9, 1902. It will be noticed that, unlike\r\nthe King's crowns, this has eight arches. The circlet which forms the base\r\nis 1½ inches in height. The crown is entirely composed of diamonds, of\r\nwhich there are 3972, and these are placed so closely together that no\r\nmetal remains visible. The large diamond visible in the illustration is the\r\nfamous Koh-i-noor. Resting upon the rim are four crosses-patée, and as many\r\nfleurs-de-lis, from each of which springs an arch. As a matter of actual\r\nfact the crown was made for use on this one occasion and has since been\r\nbroken up.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another crown, probably the one with which we are most\r\nfamiliar. This is a small crown entirely composed of diamonds: and the\r\nearliest heraldic use which can be found of it is in the design by Sir\r\nEdgar Boehm for the 1887 Jubilee coinage. Though effective enough when\r\nworn, it does not, from its small size, lend itself effectively to\r\npictorial representation, and as will be remembered, the design of the 1887\r\ncoinage was soon abandoned. This crown was made at the personal expense of\r\nQueen Victoria, and under her instructions, owing to the fact that her late\r\nMajesty found her \"State\" crown uncomfortable to wear, and too heavy for\r\nprolonged or general use. It is understood, also, that the Queen found the\r\nregulations concerning its custody both inconvenient and irritating. During\r\nthe later part of her reign this smaller crown was the only one Queen\r\nVictoria ever wore. By her will the crown was settled as an heirloom upon\r\nQueen Alexandra, to devolve upon future Queens Consort for the time being.\r\nThis being the case, it is not unlikely that in the future this crown may\r\ncome to be regarded as a part of the national regalia, and it is as well,\r\ntherefore, to reiterate the remark, that it was made at the personal\r\nexpense of her late Majesty, and is to no extent and in no way the property\r\nof the nation. {362}\r\n\r\nCORONETS OF RANK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 644.--Coronet of Thomas FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel.\r\n(From his monument in Arundel Church, 1415.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 645.--Crown of King Henry IV. (1399-1413). (From his\r\nmonument in Trinity Chapel, Canterbury Cathedral.)]\r\n\r\nIn spite of various Continental edicts, the heraldic use of coronets of\r\nrank, as also their actual use, seems elsewhere than in Great Britain to be\r\ngoverned by no such strict regulations as are laid down and conformed to in\r\nthis country. For this reason, no less than for the greater interest these\r\nmust necessarily possess for readers in this country, English coronets will\r\nfirst claim our attention. It has been already observed that coronets or\r\njewelled fillets are to be found upon the helmets even of simple knights\r\nfrom the earliest periods. They probably served no more than decorative\r\npurposes, unless these fillets be merely turbans, or suggestions thereof.\r\nAs late as the fifteenth century there appears to have been no regularised\r\nform, as will be seen from Fig. 644, which represents the coronet as shown\r\nupon the effigy of Thomas FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel, in Arundel Church\r\n(1415). A very similar coronet surmounts the head-dress of the effigy of\r\nBeatrice, Countess of Arundel, at the same period. In his will, Lionel,\r\nDuke of Clarence (1368), bequeaths \"two golden circles,\" with one of which\r\nhe was created Duke. It is of interest to compare this with Fig. 645, which\r\nrepresents the crown of King Henry IV. as represented on his effigy.\r\nRichard, Earl of Arundel, in his will (December 5, 1375), leaves his\r\n\"melieure coronne\" to his eldest son Richard, his \"second melieure coronne\"\r\nto his daughter Joan, and his \"tierce coronne\" to his daughter Alice.\r\nThough not definite proof of the point, the fact that the earl distributes\r\nhis coronets amongst his family irrespective of the fact that the earldom\r\n(of which one would presume the coronets to be a sign) would pass to his\r\nson, would seem to show that the wearing of a coronet even at that date was\r\nmerely indicative of high nobility of birth, and not of the possession of a\r\nsubstantive Parliamentary peerage. In spite of the variations {363} in\r\nform, coronets were, however, a necessity. When both dukes and earls were\r\ncreated they were invested with a coronet in open Parliament. As time went\r\non the coronet, however, gradually came to be considered the sign of the\r\npossession of a peerage, and was so borne; but it was not until the reign\r\nof Charles II. that coronets were definitely assigned by Royal Warrant\r\n(February 19, 1660) to peers not of the Blood Royal. Before this date a\r\ncoronet had not (as has been already stated) been used heraldically or in\r\nfact by barons, who, both in armorial paintings and in Parliament, had used\r\na plain crimson cap turned up with white fur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 646.--Coronet of the Prince of Wales.]\r\n\r\nThe coronet of the Prince of Wales is exactly like the official (St.\r\nEdward's) crown, except that instead of two intersecting arches it has only\r\none. An illustration of this is given in Fig. 646 (this being the usual\r\nform in which it is heraldically depicted). It should be noticed, however,\r\nthat this coronet belongs to the prince as eldest son of the Sovereign and\r\nheir-apparent to the Throne, and not as Prince of Wales. It was assigned by\r\nRoyal Warrant 9th February, 13 Charles II. The coronet of the Princess of\r\nWales, as such, is heraldically the same as that of her husband.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 647.--Coronet of the younger children of the\r\nSovereign.]\r\n\r\nThe coronets of the sons and daughters or brothers and sisters of a\r\nsovereign of Great Britain (other than a Prince of Wales) is as in Fig.\r\n647, that is, the circlet being identical with that of the Royal Crown, and\r\nof the Prince of Wales' coronet, but without the arch. This was also\r\nassigned in the warrant of 9th February, 13 Charles II. Officially this\r\ncoronet is described as being composed of crosses-patée and fleurs-de-lis\r\nalternately.\r\n\r\nThe grandchildren of a sovereign being sons and daughters of the Prince of\r\nWales, or of other sons of the sovereign, have a coronet in which\r\nstrawberry leaves are substituted for the two outer crosses-patée appearing\r\nat the edges of the coronet, which is officially described as composed of\r\ncrosses-patée, fleurs-de-lis, and strawberry leaves.\r\n\r\nPrinces of the English Royal Family, being sons of younger sons of a\r\nsovereign, or else nephews of a sovereign being sons of brothers of a\r\nsovereign, and having the rank and title of a duke of the United Kingdom,\r\nhave a coronet composed alternately of crosses-patée and strawberry leaves,\r\nthe latter taking the place of the fleurs-de-lis upon {364} the circlet of\r\nthe Royal Crown. This coronet was also assigned in the warrant of 9th\r\nFebruary, 13 Charles II.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed by those who compare one heraldic book with another\r\nthat I have quoted these rules differently from any other work upon the\r\nsubject. A moment's thought, however, must convince any one of the accuracy\r\nof my version. It is a cardinal rule of armory that save for the single\r\ncircumstance of attainder no man's armorial insignia shall be degraded.\r\nWhilst any man's status may be increased, it cannot be lessened. Most\r\nheraldic books quote the coronet of crosses-patée, fleurs-de-lis, and\r\nstrawberry leaves as the coronet of the \"grandsons\" of the sovereign,\r\nwhilst the coronet of crosses-patée and strawberry leaves is stated to be\r\nthe coronet of \"nephews\" or cousins of the sovereign. Such a state of\r\naffairs would be intolerable, because it would mean the liability at any\r\nmoment to be degraded to the use of a less honourable coronet. Take, for\r\nexample, the case of Prince Arthur of Connaught. During the lifetime of\r\nQueen Victoria, as a grandson of the sovereign he would be entitled to the\r\nformer, whereas as soon as King Edward ascended the throne he would have\r\nbeen forced to relinquish it in favour of the more remote form.\r\n\r\nThe real truth is that the members of the Royal Family do not inherit these\r\ncoronets as a matter of course. They technically and in fact have no\r\ncoronets until these have been assigned by Royal Warrant with the arms.\r\nWhen such warrants are issued, the coronets assigned have up to the present\r\ntime conformed to the above rules. I am not sure that the \"rules\" now exist\r\nin any more potent form than that up to the present time those particular\r\npatterns happen to have been assigned in the circumstances stated. But the\r\nwarrants (though they contain no hereditary limitation) certainly contain\r\nno clause limiting their operation to the lifetime of the then sovereign,\r\nwhich they certainly would do if the coronet only existed whilst the\r\nparticular relationship continued.\r\n\r\nThe terms \"grandson of the sovereign\" and \"nephew of the sovereign,\" which\r\nare usually employed, are not correct. The coronets only apply to the\r\nchildren of _princes_. The children of princesses, who are undoubtedly\r\nincluded in the terms \"grandson\" and \"nephew,\" are not technically members\r\nof the Royal Family, nor do they inherit either rank or coronet from their\r\nmothers.\r\n\r\nBy a curious fatality there has never, since these Royal coronets were\r\ndifferentiated, been any male descendant of an English sovereign more\r\nremotely related than a nephew, with the exception of the Dukes of\r\nCumberland. Their succession to the throne of Hanover renders them useless\r\nas a precedent, inasmuch as their right to arms and coronet must be derived\r\nfrom Hanover and its laws, and not {365} from this country. The Princess\r\nFrederica of Hanover, however, uses an English coronet and the Royal Arms\r\nof England, presumably preferring her status as a princess of this country\r\nto whatever _de jure_ Hanoverian status might be claimed. It is much to be\r\nwished that a Royal Warrant should be issued to her which would decide the\r\npoint--at present in doubt--as to what degree of relationship the coronet\r\nof the crosses-patée and strawberry leaves is available for, or failing\r\nthat coronet what the coronet of prince or princess of this country might\r\nbe, he or she not being child, grandchild, or nephew or niece of a\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nThe unique use of actual coronets in England at the occasion of each\r\ncoronation ceremony has prevented them becoming (as in so many other\r\ncountries) mere pictured heraldic details. Consequently the instructions\r\nconcerning them which are issued prior to each coronation will be of\r\ninterest. The following is from the _London Gazette_ of October 1, 1901:--\r\n\r\n     \"EARL MARSHAL'S OFFICE,\r\n      NORFOLK HOUSE, ST.

This latter is of fine scarlet cloth, lined with taffeta. The\r\ndistinction between the degrees of rank is effected by the guards or bands\r\nof fur. The robe of a duke has four guards of _ermine_ at equal distances,\r\nwith gold lace above each guard and tied up to the left shoulder by a white\r\nriband. The robe of a marquess has four guards of _ermine_ on the right\r\nside, and three on the left, with gold lace above each guard and tied up to\r\nthe left shoulder by a white riband. An earl's robe has three guards of\r\nermine and gold lace. The robes of a viscount and baron are identical, each\r\nhaving two guards of plain _white_ fur.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of various warrants of Earls Marshal, duly recorded in the\r\nCollege of Arms, the use or display of a coronet of rank by any person\r\nother than a peer is stringently forbidden. This rule, unfortunately, is\r\ntoo often ignored by many eldest sons of peers, who use peerage titles by\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\nThe heraldic representations of these coronets of rank are as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe coronet of a duke shows five strawberry leaves (Fig. 648). This coronet\r\nshould not be confused with the ducal _crest_ coronet.\r\n\r\nThe coronet of a marquess shows two balls of silver technically known as\r\n\"pearls,\" and three strawberry leaves (Fig. 649).\r\n\r\nThe coronet of an earl shows five \"pearls\" raised on tall spikes,\r\nalternating with four strawberry leaves (Fig. 650). {368}\r\n\r\nThe coronet of a viscount shows nine \"pearls,\" all set closely together,\r\ndirectly upon the circlet (Fig. 651).\r\n\r\nThe coronet of a baron shows four \"pearls\" upon the circlet (Fig. 652).\r\nThis coronet was assigned by Royal Warrant, dated 7th August, 12 Charles\r\nII., to Barons of England, and to Barons of Ireland by warrant 16th May, 5\r\nJames II.\r\n\r\nAll coronets of degree actually, and are usually represented to, enclose a\r\ncap of crimson velvet, turned up with ermine. None of them are permitted to\r\nbe jewelled, but the coronet of a duke, marquess, earl, or viscount is\r\nchased in the form of jewels. In recent times, however, it has become very\r\nusual for peers to use, heraldically, for more informal purposes a\r\nrepresentation of the circlet only, omitting the cap and the ermine edging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 648.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 649.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 650.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 651.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 652.]\r\n\r\nThe crown or coronet of a king of arms (Fig. 653) is of silver-gilt formed\r\nof a circlet, upon which is inscribed part of the first verse of the 51st\r\nPsalm, viz.: \"Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam misericordiam tuam.\" The\r\nrim is surmounted with sixteen leaves, in shape resembling the oak-leaf,\r\nevery alternate one being somewhat higher than the rest, nine of which\r\nappear in the profile view of it or in heraldic representations. The cap is\r\nof crimson satin, closed at the top by a gold tassel and turned up with\r\nermine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 653.--The Crown of a King of Arms.]\r\n\r\nAnciently, the crown of Lyon King of Arms was, in shape, an exact replica\r\nof the crown of the King of Scotland, the only difference being that it was\r\nnot jewelled.\r\n\r\nCoronets of rank are used very indiscriminately on the Continent,\r\nparticularly in France and the Low Countries. Their use by no means implies\r\nthe same as with us, and frequently indicates little if anything beyond\r\nmere \"noble\" birth.\r\n\r\nThe _Mauerkrone_ [mural crown] (Fig. 654) is used in Germany principally as\r\nan adornment to the arms of towns. It is borne with three, four, or five\r\nbattlemented towers. The tincture, likewise, is not {369} always the same:\r\ngold, silver, red, or the natural colour of a wall being variously\r\nemployed. Residential [_i.e._ having a _royal_ residence] and capital towns\r\nusually bear a Mauerkrone with five towers, large towns one with four\r\ntowers, smaller towns one with three. Strict regulations in the matter do\r\nnot yet exist. It should be carefully noted that this practice is peculiar\r\nto Germany and is quite incorrect in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 654.--Mauerkrone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 655.--Naval crown.]\r\n\r\nThe _Naval Crown_ [Schiffskrone] (Fig. 655), on the circlet of which sails\r\nand sterns of ships are alternately introduced, is very rarely used on the\r\nContinent. With us it appears as a charge in the arms of the towns of\r\nChatham, Ramsgate, Devonport, &c. The Naval Coronet, however, is more\r\nproperly a crest coronet, and as such will be more fully considered in the\r\nnext chapter. It had, however, a limited use as a coronet of rank at one\r\ntime, inasmuch as the admirals of the United Provinces of the Netherlands\r\nplaced a crown composed of prows of ships above their escutcheons, as may\r\nbe seen from various monuments. {370}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nCREST CORONETS AND CHAPEAUX\r\n\r\nThe present official rules are that crests must be upon, or must issue\r\nfrom, a wreath (or torse), a coronet, or a chapeau. It is not at the\r\npleasure of the wearer to choose which he will, one or other being\r\nspecified and included in the terms of the grant. If the crest have a\r\nlawful existence, one or other of them will unchangeably belong to the\r\ncrest, of which it now is considered to be an integral part.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland and Ireland, Lyon King of Arms and Ulster King of Arms have\r\nalways been considered to have, and still retain, the right to grant crests\r\nupon a chapeau or issuing from a crest. But the power is (very properly)\r\nexceedingly sparingly used; and, except in the cases of arms and crests\r\nmatriculated in Lyon Register as of ancient origin and in use before 1672,\r\nor \"confirmed\" on the strength of user by Ulster King of Arms, the ordinary\r\nducal crest coronet and the chapeau are not now considered proper to be\r\ngranted in ordinary cases.\r\n\r\nSince about the beginning of the nineteenth century the rules which follow\r\nhave been very definite, and have been very rigidly adhered to in the\r\nEnglish College of Arms.\r\n\r\nCrests issuing from the ordinary \"ducal crest coronet\" are not now granted\r\nunder any circumstances. The chapeau is only granted in the case of a grant\r\nof arms to a peer, a mural coronet is only granted to officers in the army\r\nof the rank of general or above, and the naval coronet is only granted to\r\nofficers in his Majesty's Royal Navy of the rank of admiral and above. An\r\nEastern coronet is now only granted in the case of those of high position\r\nin one or other of the Imperial Services, who have served in India and the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nThe granting of crests issuing from the other forms of crest coronets, the\r\n\"crown-vallary\" and the \"crown palisado,\" is always discouraged, but no\r\nrule exists denying them to applicants, and they are to be obtained if the\r\nexpectant grantee is sufficiently patient, importunate, and pertinacious.\r\nNeither form is, however, particularly ornamental, and both are of modern\r\norigin. {371}\r\n\r\nThere is still yet another coronet, the \"celestial coronet\". This is not\r\nunusual as a charge, but as a coronet from which a crest issues I know of\r\nno instance, nor am I aware of what rules, if any, govern the granting of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDefinite rank coronets have been in times past granted for use as crest\r\ncoronets, but this practice, the propriety of which cannot be considered as\r\nother than highly questionable, has only been pursued, even in the more lax\r\ndays which are past, on rare and very exceptional occasions, and has long\r\nsince been definitely abandoned as improper.\r\n\r\nIn considering the question of crest coronets, the presumption that they\r\noriginated from coronets of rank at once jumps to the mind. This is by no\r\nmeans a foregone conclusion. It is difficult to say what is the earliest\r\ninstance of the use of a coronet in this country as a coronet of rank. When\r\nit is remembered that the coronet of a baron had no existence whatever\r\nuntil it was called into being by a warrant of Charles II. after the\r\nRestoration, and that differentiated coronets for the several ranks in the\r\nPeerage are not greatly anterior in date, the question becomes distinctly\r\ncomplicated. From certainly the reign of Edward the Confessor the kings of\r\nEngland had worn crowns, and the great territorial earls, who it must be\r\nremembered occupied a position akin to that of a petty sovereign (far\r\nbeyond the mere high dignity of a great noble at the present day), from an\r\nearly period wore crowns or coronets not greatly differing in appearance\r\nfrom the crown of the king. But the Peerage as such certainly neither had\r\nnor claimed the technical right to a coronet as a mark of their rank, in\r\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. But coronets of a kind were used,\r\nas can be seen from early effigies, long before the use of crests became\r\ngeneral. But these coronets were merely in the nature of a species of\r\ndecoration for the helmet, many of them far more closely resembling a\r\njewelled torse than a coronet. Parker in his \"Glossary of Terms used in\r\nHeraldry\" probably correctly represents the case when he states: \"From the\r\nreign of Edward III. coronets of various forms were worn (as it seems\r\nindiscriminately) by princes, dukes, earls, and even knights, but\r\napparently rather by way of ornament than distinction, or if for\r\ndistinction, only (like the collar of SS) as a mark of gentility. The\r\nhelmet of Edward the Black Prince, upon his effigy at Canterbury, is\r\nsurrounded with a coronet totally different from that subsequently assigned\r\nto his rank.\"\r\n\r\nThe instance quoted by Parker might be amplified by countless others, but\r\nit may here with advantage be pointed out that the great helmet (or, as\r\nthis probably is, the ceremonial representation of it) suspended above the\r\nPrince's tomb (Fig. 271) has no coronet, and the crest is upon a chapeau.\r\nOf the fourteen instances in the {372} Plantagenet Garter plates in which\r\nthe _torse_ appears, twelve were peers of England, one was a foreign count,\r\nand one only a commoner. On the other hand, of twenty-nine whose Garter\r\nplates show crests issuing from coronets, four are foreigners, seven are\r\ncommoners, and eighteen were peers. The coronets show very great variations\r\nin form and design, but such variations appear quite capricious, and to\r\ncarry no meaning, nor does it seem probable that a coronet of gules or of\r\nazure, of which there are ten, could represent a coronet of rank. The\r\nGarter plate of Sir William De la Pole, Earl of (afterwards Duke of)\r\nSuffolk, shows his crest upon a narrow black fillet. Consequently, whatever\r\nmay be the conclusion as to the wearing of coronets alone, it would seem to\r\nbe a very certain conclusion that the heraldic crest coronet bore no\r\nrelation to any coronet of rank or to the right to wear one. Its adoption\r\nmust have been in the original instance, and probably even in subsequent\r\ngenerations, a matter of pure fancy and inclination. This is borne out by\r\nthe fact that whilst the Garter plate of Sir Henry Bourchier, Earl of\r\nEssex, shows his crest upon a torse, his effigy represents it issuing from\r\na coronet.\r\n\r\nUntil the reign of Henry VIII., the Royal crest, both in the case of the\r\nsovereign and all the other members of the Royal Family, is always\r\nrepresented upon a chapeau or cap of dignity. The Great Seal of Edward VI.\r\nshows the crest upon a coronet, though the present form of crown and crest\r\nwere originated by Queen Elizabeth. In depicting the Royal Arms, it is\r\nusual to omit one of the crowns, and this is always done in the official\r\nwarrants controlling the arms. One crown is placed upon the helmet, and\r\nupon this crown is placed the crest, but theoretically the Royal\r\nachievement has two crowns, inasmuch as one of the crowns is an inseparable\r\npart of the crest. Probably the finest representation of the Royal crest\r\nwhich has ever been done is the design for one of the smaller bookplates\r\nfor the Windsor Castle Library. This was executed by Mr. Eve, and it would\r\nbe impossible to imagine anything finer. Like the rest of the Royal\r\nachievement, the Royal crest is of course not hereditary, and consequently\r\nit is assigned by a _separate_ Royal Warrant to each male member of the\r\nRoyal Family, and the opportunity is then taken to substitute for the Royal\r\ncrown, which is a part of the sovereign's crest, a coronet identical with\r\nwhatever may be assigned in that particular instance as the coronet of\r\nrank. In the case of Royal bastards the crest has always been assigned upon\r\na chapeau.\r\n\r\nThe only case which comes to one's mind in which the Royal crown has\r\n(outside the sovereign) been allowed as a crest coronet is the case of the\r\ntown of Eye.\r\n\r\nThe Royal crown of Scotland is the crest coronet of the sovereign's {373}\r\ncrest for the kingdom of Scotland. This crest, together with the crest of\r\nIreland, is never assigned to any member of the Royal Family except the\r\nsovereign. The crest of Ireland (which is on a wreath or and azure) is by\r\nthe way confirmatory evidence that the crowns in the crests of Scotland and\r\nEngland have a duplicate and separate existence apart from the crown\r\ndenoting the sovereignty of the realm.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary crest coronet or, as it is usually termed in British heraldry,\r\nthe \"ducal coronet\" (Ulster, however, describes it officially as \"a ducal\r\ncrest coronet\"), is quite a separate matter from a duke's coronet of rank.\r\nWhilst the coronet of a duke has upon the rim five strawberry leaves\r\nvisible when depicted, a ducal coronet has only three. The \"ducal coronet\"\r\n(Fig. 656) is the conventional \"regularised\" development of the crest\r\ncoronets employed in early times.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it has in many instances been depicted of a much greater and\r\nvery unnecessary width, the result being inartistic and allowing\r\nunnecessary space between the leaves, and at the same time leaving the\r\ncrest and coronet with little circumferential relation. It should be noted\r\nthat it is quite incorrect for the rim of the coronet to be jewelled in\r\ncolour though the outline of jewelling is indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 656.--Ducal coronet.]\r\n\r\nThough ducal crest coronets are no longer granted (of course they are still\r\nexemplified and their use permitted where they have been previously\r\ngranted), they are of very frequent occurrence in older grants and\r\nconfirmations.\r\n\r\nIt is quite incorrect to depict a cap (as in a coronet of rank) in a crest\r\ncoronet, which is never more than the metal circlet, and consequently it is\r\nequally incorrect to add the band of ermine below it which will sometimes\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nThe coronet of a duke has in one or two isolated cases been granted as a\r\ncrest coronet. In such a case it is not described as a duke's coronet, but\r\nas a \"ducal coronet of five leaves.\" It so occurs in the case of\r\nOrmsby-Hamilton.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the crest coronet must be stated in the blazon. Crest\r\ncoronets are of all colours, and will be sometimes found bearing charges\r\nupon the rim (particularly in the cases of mural and naval coronets). An\r\ninstance of this will be seen in the case of Sir John W. Moore, and of\r\nMansergh, the label in this latter case being an unalterable charge and not\r\nthe difference mark of an eldest son. Though the tincture of the coronet\r\nought to appear in the blazon, nevertheless it is always a fair presumption\r\n(when it is not specified) that it is of gold, coronets of colours being\r\nvery much less frequently met with. On this point it is interesting to note\r\nthat in some of the cases where {374} the crest coronet is figured upon an\r\nearly Garter plate as of colour, it is now borne gold by the present\r\ndescendants of the family. For example on the Garter plate of Sir Walter\r\nHungerford, Lord Hungerford, the crest [\"A garb or, between two silver\r\nsickles\"] issues from a coronet azure. The various Hungerford families now\r\nbear it \"or.\" The crest upon the Garter plate of Sir Humphrey Stafford,\r\nDuke of Buckingham [\"A demi-swan argent, beaked gules\"], issues from a\r\ncoronet gules. This crest as it is now borne by the present Lord Stafford\r\nis: \"Out of a ducal coronet per pale gules and sable,\" &c.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of coloured coronets will be found in the crest of\r\nNicholson, now borne by Shaw.[22]\r\n\r\nProbably, however, the most curious instance of all will be found in the\r\ncase of a crest coronet of ermine, of which an example occurs in the Gelre\r\n\"Armorial.\"\r\n\r\nA very general misconception--which will be found stated in practically\r\nevery text-book of armory--is that when a crest issues from a coronet the\r\nwreath must be omitted. There is not and never has been any such rule. The\r\nrule is rather to the contrary. Instances where both occur are certainly\r\nnow uncommon, and the presence of a wreath is not in present-day practice\r\nconsidered to be essential if a coronet occurs, but the use or absence of a\r\nwreath when the crest issues from a coronet really depends entirely upon\r\nthe original grant. If no wreath is specified with the coronet, none will\r\nbe used or needed, but if both are granted both should be used. An instance\r\nof the use of both will be found on the Garter Stall plate of Sir Walter\r\nDevereux, Lord Ferrers. The crest (a talbot's head silver) issues from a\r\ncoronet or, which is placed upon a torse argent and sable. Another instance\r\nwill be found in the case of the grant of the crest of Hanbury.\r\n\r\nA quite recent case was the grant by Sir Bernard Burke, Ulster King of\r\nArms, of a crest to Sir Richard Quain, Bart., the blazon of which was: \"On\r\na wreath argent and azure, and out of a mural coronet proper a demi-lion\r\nrampant or, charged on the shoulder with a trefoil slipped vert, and\r\nholding between the paws a battle-axe also proper, the blade gold.\"\r\n\r\nOther instances are the crests of Hamilton of Sunningdale and Tarleton.\r\n\r\nAnother instance will be found in the grant to Ross-of-Bladensburg.\r\nPossibly this blazon may be a clerical error in the engrossment, because it\r\nwill be noticed that the wreath does not appear in the emblazonment (Plate\r\nII.).\r\n\r\nI wonder how many of the officers of arms are aware of the {375} existence\r\nof a warrant, dated in 1682, issued by the Deputy Earl-Marshal to the\r\nCompanies of Painters, Stainers, and Coachmakers, forbidding them to paint\r\ncrests which issue out of ducal coronets without putting them upon \"wreaths\r\nof their colours.\" The wording of the warrant very plainly shows that at\r\nthat date a wreath was always painted below a crest coronet. The warrant,\r\nhowever, is not so worded that it can be accepted as determining the point\r\nfor the future, or that it would override a subsequent grant of a crest in\r\ncontrary form. But it is evidence of what the law then was.\r\n\r\nNo crest is now granted without either wreath, coronet, or chapeau.\r\n\r\nAn instance of the use of the coronet of a marquess as a crest coronet will\r\nbe found in the case of the Bentinck crest.[23]\r\n\r\nThere are some number of instances of the use of an earl's coronet as a\r\ncrest coronet. Amongst these may be mentioned the crests of Sir Alan Seton\r\nSteuart, Bart. [\"Out of an earl's coronet a dexter hand grasping a thistle\r\nall proper\"], that granted to Cassan of Sheffield House, Ireland [\"Issuant\r\nfrom an earl's coronet proper, a boar's head and neck erased or langued\r\ngules\"], James Christopher Fitzgerald Kenney, Esq., Dublin [\"Out of an\r\nearl's coronet or, the pearls argent, a cubit arm erect vested gules,\r\ncuffed also argent, the hand grasping a roll of parchment proper\"], and\r\nDavidson [\"Out of an earl's coronet or, a dove rising argent, holding in\r\nthe beak a wheat-stalk bladed and eared all proper\"].\r\n\r\nI know of no crest which issues from the coronet of a viscount, but a\r\nbaron's coronet occurs in the case of Forbes of Pitsligo and the cadets of\r\nthat branch of the family: \"Issuing out of a baron's coronet a dexter hand\r\nholding a scimitar all proper.\"\r\n\r\nForeign coronets of rank have sometimes been granted as crest coronets in\r\nthis country, as in the cases of the crests of Sir Francis George\r\nManningham Boileau, Bart., Norfolk [\"In a nest or, a pelican in her piety\r\nproper, charged on the breast with a saltire couped gules, the nest resting\r\nin a foreign coronet\"], Henry Chamier, Esq., Dublin [\"Out of a French noble\r\ncoronet proper, a cubit arm in bend vested azure, charged with five\r\nfleurs-de-lis in saltire or, cuffed ermine, holding in the hand a scroll,\r\nand thereon an open book proper, garnished gold\"], John Francis Charles\r\nFane De Salis, Count of the Holy Roman Empire [\"1. Out of a marquis'\r\ncoronet or, a demi-woman proper, crowned or, hair flowing down the back,\r\nwinged in place of arms and from the armpits azure; 2. out of a ducal\r\ncoronet or, an eagle displayed sable, ducally crowned also or; 3. out of a\r\nducal coronet a demi-lion rampant double-queued and crowned with a like\r\n{376} coronet all or, brandishing a sword proper, hilt and pommel of the\r\nfirst, the lion cottised by two tilting-spears of the same, from each a\r\nbanner paly of six argent and gules, fringed also or\"], and Mahony, Ireland\r\n[\"Out of the coronet of a Count of France a dexter arm in armour embowed\r\ngrasping in the hand a sword all proper, hilt and pommel or, the blade\r\npiercing a fleur-de-lis of the last\"].\r\n\r\nA curious crest coronet will be found with the Sackville crest. This is\r\ncomposed of fleurs-de-lis only, the blazon of the crest being: \"Out of a\r\ncoronet composed of eight fleurs-de-lis or, an estoile of eight points\r\nargent.\"\r\n\r\nA curious use of coronets in a crest will be found in the crest of Sir\r\nArchibald Dunbar, Bart. [\"A dexter hand apaumée reaching at an astral crown\r\nproper\"] and Sir Alexander James Dunbar, Bart. [\"A dexter hand apaumée\r\nproper reaching to two earls' coronets tied together\"].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 657.--Mural coronet.]\r\n\r\nNext after the ordinary \"ducal coronet\" the one most usually employed is\r\nthe mural coronet (Fig. 657), which is composed of masonry. Though it may\r\nbe and often is of an ordinary heraldic tincture, it will usually be found\r\n\"proper.\" An exception occurs in the case of the crest of Every-Halstead\r\n[\"Out of a mural coronet chequy or and azure, a demi-eagle ermine beaked\r\nor.\"]\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to distinguish the mural crown from the \"battlements\r\nof a tower.\" This originated as a modern \"fakement\" and is often granted to\r\nthose who have been using a mural coronet, and desire to continue within\r\nits halo, but are not qualified to obtain in their own persons a grant of\r\nit. It should be noticed that the battlements of a tower must always be\r\nrepresented upon a wreath. Its facility for adding a noticeable distinction\r\nto a crest has, however, in these days, when it is becoming somewhat\r\ndifficult to introduce differences in a stock pattern kind of crest, led to\r\nits very frequent use in grants during the last hundred years.\r\n\r\nCare should also be taken to distinguish between the \"battlements of a\r\ntower\" and a crest issuing from \"a castle,\" as in the case of Harley; \"a\r\ntower,\" as in that of Boyce; and upon the \"capital of a column,\" as in the\r\ncrests of Cowper-Essex and Pease.\r\n\r\nAbroad, _e.g._ in the arms of Paris, it is very usual to place a mural\r\ncrown over the shield of a town, and some remarks upon the point will be\r\nfound on page 368. This at first sight may seem an appropriate practice to\r\npursue, and several heraldic artists have followed it and advocate it in\r\nthis country. But the correctness of such a practice is, for British\r\npurposes, strongly and emphatically denied officially, and whilst we\r\nreserve this privilege for grants to certain army officers of high {377}\r\nrank, it does not seem proper that it should be available for casual and\r\nhaphazard assumption by a town or city. That being the case, it should be\r\nborne in mind that the practice is not permissible in British armory.\r\n\r\nThe naval coronet (Fig. 658), though but seldom granted now, was very\r\npopular at one time. In the latter part of the eighteenth and the early\r\npart of the nineteenth centuries, naval actions were constantly being\r\nfought, and in a large number of cases where the action of the officer in\r\ncommand was worthy of high praise and reward, part of such reward was\r\nusually an augmentation of arms. Very frequently it is found that the crest\r\nof augmentation issued from a naval coronet. This is, as will be seen, a\r\ncurious figure composed of the sail and stern of a ship repeated and\r\nalternating on the rim of a circlet. Sometimes it is entirely gold, but\r\nusually the sails are argent. An instance of such a grant of augmentation\r\nwill be found in the crest of augmentation for Brisbane and in a crest of\r\naugmentation granted to Sir Philip Bowes Broke to commemorate his glorious\r\nvictory in the Shannon over the American ship _Chesapeake_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 658.--Naval crown.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 659.--Eastern crown.]\r\n\r\nAny future naval grant of a crest of augmentation would probably mean, that\r\nit would be granted issuing out of a naval coronet, but otherwise the\r\nprivilege is now confined to those grants of arms in which the patentee is\r\nof the rank of admiral. Instances of its use will be found in the crests of\r\nSchomberg and Farquhar, and in the crest of Dakyns of Derbyshire: \"Out of a\r\nnaval coronet or, a dexter arm embowed proper, holding in the hand a\r\nbattle-axe argent, round the wrist a ribbon azure.\" The crest of Dakyns is\r\nchiefly memorable for the curious motto which accompanies it; \"Strike,\r\nDakyns, the devil's in the hempe,\" of which no one knows the explanation.\r\n\r\nWhy a naval crown was recently granted as a badge to a family named Vickers\r\n(Plate VIII.) I am still wondering.\r\n\r\nThe crest of Lord St. Vincent [\"Out of a naval coronet or, encircled by a\r\nwreath of oak proper, a demi-pegasus argent, maned and hoofed of the first,\r\nwinged azure, charged on the wing with a fleur-de-lis gold\"] is worthy of\r\nnotice owing to the encircling of the coronet, and in some number of cases\r\nthe circlet of the coronet has been made use of to carry the name of a\r\ncaptured ship or of a naval engagement.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Coronet (Fig. 659) is a plain rim heightened with spikes.\r\nFormerly it was granted without restriction, but now, as has {378} been\r\nalready stated, it is reserved for those of high rank who have served in\r\nIndia or the East. An instance occurs, for example, in the crest of\r\nRawlinson, Bart. [\"Sable, three swords in pale proper, pommels and hilts\r\nor, two erect, points upwards, between them one, point downwards, on a\r\nchief embattled of the third an antique crown gules. Crest: out of an\r\nEastern crown or, a cubit arm erect in armour, the hand grasping a sword in\r\nbend sinister, and the wrist encircled by a laurel wreath proper\"].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 660.--Crown vallary.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 661.--Palisado crown.]\r\n\r\nOf _identically_ the same shape is what is known as the \"Antique Coronet.\"\r\nIt has no particular meaning, and though no objection is made to granting\r\nit in Scotland and Ireland, it is not granted in England. Instances in\r\nwhich it occurs under such a description will be found in the cases of\r\nLanigan O'Keefe and Matheson.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Vallary or Vallary Coronet (Fig. 660) and the Palisado Coronet\r\n(Fig. 661) were undoubtedly originally the same, but now the two forms in\r\nwhich it has been depicted are considered to be different coronets. Each\r\nhas the rim, but the vallary coronet is now heightened only by pieces of\r\nthe shape of vair, whilst the palisado coronet is formed by high\r\n\"palisadoes\" affixed to the rim. These two are the only forms of coronet\r\ngranted to ordinary and undistinguished applicants in England.\r\n\r\nThe circlet from the crown of a king of arms has once at least been granted\r\nas a crest coronet, this being in the case of Rogers Harrison.\r\n\r\nIn a recent grant of arms to Gee, the crest has no wreath, but issues from\r\n\"a circlet or, charged with a fleur-de-lis gules.\" The circlet is\r\nemblazoned as a plain gold band.\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPEAU\r\n\r\nSome number of crests will be found to have been granted to be borne upon a\r\n\"chapeau\" in lieu of wreath or coronet. Other names for the chapeau, under\r\nwhich it is equally well known, are the \"cap of maintenance\" or \"cap of\r\ndignity.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be very little doubt that the heraldic chapeau combines two\r\ndistinct origins or earlier prototypes. The one is the real cap of dignity,\r\nand the other is the hat or \"capelot\" which covered the top of the helm\r\nbefore the mantling was introduced, but from which the {379} lambrequin\r\ndeveloped. The curious evolution of the chapeau from the \"capelot,\" which\r\nis so marked and usual in Germany, is the tall conical hat, often\r\nsurmounted by a tuft or larger plume of feathers, and usually employed in\r\nGerman heraldry as an opportunity for the repetition of the livery colours,\r\nor a part of, and often the whole design of, the arms. But it should at the\r\nsame time be noticed that this tall, conical hat is much more closely\r\nallied to the real cap of maintenance than our present crest \"chapeau.\"\r\n\r\nExactly what purpose the real cap of maintenance served, or of what it was\r\na symbol, remains to a certain extent a matter of mystery. The \"Cap of\r\nMaintenance\"--a part of the regalia borne before the sovereign at the State\r\nopening of Parliament (but _not_ at a coronation) by the Marquesses of\r\nWinchester, the hereditary bearers of the cap of maintenance--bears, in its\r\nshape, no relation to the heraldic chapeau. The only similarity is its\r\ncrimson colour and its lining of ermine. It is a tall, conical cap and is\r\ncarried on a short staff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 662.--The Crown of King Charles II.]\r\n\r\nWhilst crest coronets in early days appear to have had little or no\r\nrelation to titular rank, there is no doubt whatever that caps of dignity\r\nhad. Long before, a coronet was assigned to the rank of baron in the reign\r\nof Charles II.; all barons had their caps of dignity, of scarlet lined with\r\nwhite fur; and in the old pedigrees a scarlet cap with a gold tuft or\r\ntassel on top and a lining of fur will be found painted above the arms of a\r\nbaron. This fact, the fact that until after Stuart days the chapeau does\r\nnot appear to have been allowed or granted to others than peers, the fact\r\nthat it is now reserved for the crests granted to peers, the fact that the\r\nvelvet cap is a later addition both to the sovereign's crown and to the\r\ncoronet of a peer, and finally the fact that the cap of maintenance is\r\nborne before the sovereign only in the precincts of Parliament, would seem\r\nto indubitably indicate that the cap of maintenance was inseparably\r\nconnected with the lordship and overlordship of Parliament vested in peers\r\nand in the sovereign. In the crumpled and tasselled top of the velvet cap,\r\nand in the ermine border visible below the rim, the high conical form of\r\nthe cap of maintenance proper can be still traced in the cap of a peer's\r\ncoronet, and that the velvet cap contained in {380} the crown of the\r\nsovereign and in the coronet of a peer is the survival of the old cap of\r\ndignity there can be no doubt. This is perhaps even more apparent in Fig.\r\n662, which shows the crown of King Charles II., than in the representations\r\nof the Royal crown which we are more accustomed to see. The present form of\r\na peer's coronet is undoubtedly the conjoining of two separate emblems of\r\nhis rank. The cap of maintenance or dignity, however, as represented above\r\nthe arms of a baron, as above referred to, was not of this high, conical\r\nshape. It was much flatter.\r\n\r\nThe high, conical, original shape is, however, preserved in many of the\r\nearly heraldic representations of the chapeau, as will be noticed from an\r\nexamination of the ancient Garter plates or from a reference to Fig. 271,\r\nwhich shows the helmet with its chapeau-borne crest of Edward the Black\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 663.--The Chapeau.]\r\n\r\nOf the chapeaux upon which crests are represented in the early Garter\r\nplates the following facts may be observed. They are twenty in number of\r\nthe eighty-six plates reproduced in Mr. St. John Hope's book. It should be\r\nnoticed that until the end of the reign of Henry VIII. the Royal crest of\r\nthe sovereign was always depicted upon a chapeau gules, lined with ermine.\r\nOf the twenty instances in which the chapeau appears, no less than twelve\r\nare representations of the Royal crest, borne by closely allied relatives\r\nof the sovereign, so that we have only eight examples from which to draw\r\ndeductions. But of the twenty it should be pointed out that nineteen are\r\npeers, and the only remaining instance (Sir John Grey, K.G.) is that of the\r\neldest son and heir apparent of a peer, both shield and crest being in this\r\ncase boldly marked with the \"label\" of an eldest son. Consequently it is a\r\nsafe deduction that whatever may have been the regulations and customs\r\nconcerning the use of coronets, there can be no doubt that down to the end\r\nof the fifteenth century the use of a chapeau marked a crest as that of a\r\npeer. Of the eight non-Royal examples one has been repainted, and is\r\nvalueless as a contemporary record. Of the remaining seven, four are of the\r\nconventional gules and ermine. One only has not the ermine lining, that\r\nbeing the crest of Lord Fanhope. It is plainly the Royal crest\r\n\"differenced\" (he being of Royal but illegitimate descent), and probably\r\nthe argent in lieu of ermine lining is one of the intentional marks of\r\ndistinction. The chapeau of Lord Beaumont is azure, semé-de-lis, lined\r\nermine, and that of the Earl of Douglas is azure lined ermine, this being\r\nin each case in conformity with the mantling. Whilst the Beaumont family\r\nstill use this curiously coloured chapeau with their crest, the Douglas\r\ncrest is now borne (by {381} the Duke of Hamilton) upon one of ordinary\r\ntinctures. Chapeaux, other than of gules lined ermine, are but rarely met\r\nwith, and unless specifically blazoned to the contrary a cap of maintenance\r\nis always presumed to be gules and ermine.\r\n\r\nAbout the Stuart period the granting of crests upon chapeaux to others than\r\npeers became far from unusual, and the practice appears to have been\r\nfrequently adopted prior to the beginning of the nineteenth century. Some\r\nof these crest chapeaux, however, were not of gules. An instance of this\r\nkind will be found in the grant in 1667 to Sir Thomas Davies, then one of\r\nthe sheriffs of the City of London, but afterwards (in 1677) Lord Mayor.\r\nThe crest granted was: \"On a chapeau sable, turned up or, a demi-lion\r\nrampant of the last.\" The reason for the grant at that date of such a\r\nsimple crest and the even more astonishingly simple coat of arms [\"Or, a\r\nchevron between three mullets pierced sable\"] has always been a mystery to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Lord Lurgan (granted or confirmed 1840) afford another instance\r\nof a chapeau of unusual colour, his crest being: \"Upon a chapeau azure\r\nturned up ermine, a greyhound statant gules, collared or.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some number of cases in which peers whose ancestors originally\r\nbore their crests upon a wreath have subsequently placed them upon a\r\nchapeau. The Stanleys, Earls of Derby, are a case in point, as are also the\r\nMarquesses of Exeter. The latter case is curious, because although they\r\nhave for long enough so depicted their crest, they only comparatively\r\nrecently (within the last few years) obtained the necessary authorisation\r\nby the Crown.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the official form of the chapeau is as in Fig. 663,\r\nwith the turn up split at the back into two tails. No such form can be\r\nfound in any early representation, and most heraldic artists have now\r\nreverted to an earlier type.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of the cap of maintenance, reference should be\r\nmade to another instance of a curious heraldic headgear often, but _quite\r\nincorrectly_, styled a \"cap of maintenance.\" This is the fur cap invariably\r\nused over the shields of the cities of London, Dublin, and Norwich. There\r\nis no English official authority whatever for such an addition to the arms,\r\nbut there does appear to be some little official recognition of it in\r\nUlster's Office in the case of the city of Dublin. The late Ulster King of\r\nArms, however, informed me that he would, in the case of Dublin, have no\r\nhesitation whatever in certifying the right of the city arms to be so\r\ndisplayed (Plate VII.).\r\n\r\nIn the utter absence of anything in the nature of a precedent, it is quite\r\nunlikely that the practice will be sanctioned in England. The {382} hat\r\nused is a flat-topped, brown fur hat of the shape depicted with the arms of\r\nthe City of Dublin. It is merely (in London) a part of the official uniform\r\nor livery of the City sword-bearer. It does not even appear to have been a\r\npart of the costume of the Lord Mayor, and it must always remain a mystery\r\nwhy it was ever adopted for heraldic use. But then the chain of the Lord\r\nMayor of London is generally called a Collar of SS. Besides this the City\r\nof London uses a Peer's helmet, a bogus modern crest, and even more modern\r\nbogus supporters, so a few other eccentricities need not in that particular\r\ninstance cause surprise. {383}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE MANTLING OR LAMBREQUIN\r\n\r\nThe mantling is the ornamental design which in a representation of an\r\narmorial achievement depends from the helmet, falling away on either side\r\nof the escutcheon. Many authorities have considered it to have been no more\r\nthan a fantastic series of flourishes, devised by artistic minds for the\r\npurpose of assisting ornamentation and affording an artistic opportunity of\r\nfilling up unoccupied spaces in a heraldic design. There is no doubt that\r\nits readily apparent advantages in that character have greatly led to the\r\nimportance now attached to the mantling in heraldic art. But equally is it\r\ncertain that its real origin is to be traced elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe development of the heraldry of to-day was in the East during the period\r\nof the Crusades, and the burning heat of the Eastern sun upon the metal\r\nhelmet led to the introduction and adoption of a textile covering, which\r\nwould act in some way as a barrier between the two. It was simply in fact\r\nand effect a primeval prototype of the \"puggaree\" of Margate and Hindustan.\r\nIt is plain from all early representations that originally it was short,\r\nsimply hanging from the apex of the helmet to the level of the shoulders,\r\noverlapping the textile tunic or \"coat of arms,\" but probably enveloping a\r\ngreater part of the helmet, neck, and shoulders than we are at present\r\n(judging from pictorial representations) inclined to believe.\r\n\r\nAdopted first as a protection against the heat, and perhaps also the rust\r\nwhich would follow damp, the lambrequin soon made evident another of its\r\nadvantages, an advantage to which we doubtless owe its perpetuation outside\r\nEastern warfare in the more temperate climates of Northern Europe and\r\nEngland. Textile fabrics are peculiarly and remarkably deadening to a\r\nsword-cut, to which fact must be added the facility with which such a\r\nweapon would become entangled in the hanging folds of cloth. The hacking\r\nand hewing of battle would show itself plainly upon the lambrequin of one\r\naccustomed to a prominent position in the forefront of a fight, and the\r\nhonourable record implied by a ragged and slashed lambrequin accounts for\r\nthe fact that we find at an early period after their introduction into\r\nheraldic art, that mantlings {384} are depicted cut and \"torn to ribbons.\"\r\nThis opportunity was quickly seized by the heraldic artist, who has always,\r\nfrom those very earliest times of absolute armorial freedom down to the\r\npoint of greatest and most regularised control, been allowed an entire and\r\nabsolute discretion in the design to be adopted for the mantling. Hence it\r\nis that we find so much importance is given to it by heraldic artists, for\r\nit is in the design of the mantling, and almost entirely in that\r\nopportunity, that the personal character and abilities of the artist have\r\ntheir greatest scope. Some authorities have, however, derived the mantling\r\nfrom the robe of estate, and there certainly has been a period in British\r\narmory when most lambrequins found in heraldic art are represented by an\r\nunmutilated cloth, suspended from and displayed behind the armorial\r\nbearings and tied at the upper corners. In all probability the robes of\r\nestate of the higher nobility, no less than the then existing and\r\nperemptorily enforced sumptuary laws, may have led to the desire and to the\r\nattempt, at a period when the actual lambrequin was fast disappearing from\r\ngeneral knowledge, to display arms upon something which should represent\r\neither the parliamentary robes of estate of a peer, or the garments of rich\r\nfabric which the sumptuary laws forbade to those of humble degree. To this\r\nperiod undoubtedly belongs the term \"mantling,\" which is so much more\r\nfrequently employed than the word lambrequin, which is really--from the\r\narmorial point of view--the older term.\r\n\r\nThe heraldic mantling was, of course, originally the representation of the\r\nactual \"capeline\" or textile covering worn upon the helmet, but many early\r\nheraldic representations are of mantlings which are of skin, fur, or\r\nfeathers, being in such cases invariably a continuation of the crest drawn\r\nout and represented as the lambrequin. When the crest was a part of the\r\nhuman figure, the habit in which that figure was arrayed is almost\r\ninvariably found to have been so employed. The Garter plate of Sir Ralph\r\nBassett, one of the Founder Knights, shows the crest as a black boar's\r\nhead, the skin being continued as the sable mantling.\r\n\r\nSome Sclavonic families have mantlings of fur only, that of the Hungarian\r\nfamily of Chorinski is a bear skin, and countless other instances can be\r\nfound of the use by German families of a continuation of the crest for a\r\nmantling. This practice affords instances of many curious mantlings, this\r\nin one case in the Zurich _Wappenrolle_ being the scaly skin of a salmon.\r\nThe mane of the lion, the crest of Mertz, and the hair and beard of the\r\ncrests of Bohn and Landschaden, are similarly continued to do duty for the\r\nmantling. This practice has never found great favour in England, the cases\r\namongst the early Garter plates where it has been followed standing almost\r\nalone. In a {385} manuscript (M. 3, 67_b_) of the reign of Henry VII., now\r\nin the College of Arms, probably dating from about 1506, an instance of\r\nthis character can be found, however. It is a representation of the crest\r\nof Stourton (Fig. 664) as it was borne at that date, and was a black\r\nBenedictine demi-monk proper holding erect in his dexter hand a scourge.\r\nHere the proper black Benedictine habit (it has of later years been\r\ncorrupted into the russet habit of a friar) is continued to form the\r\nmantling.\r\n\r\nPLATE VII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 664.--The Crest of Stourton.]\r\n\r\nBy what rules the colours of the mantlings were decided in early times it\r\nis impossible to say. No rules have been handed down to us--the old\r\nheraldic books are silent on the point--and it seems equally hopeless to\r\nattempt to deduce any from ancient armorial examples. The one fact that can\r\nbe stated with certainty is that the rules of early days, if there were\r\nany, are not the rules presently observed. Some hold that the colours of\r\nthe mantling were decided by the colours of the actual livery in use as\r\ndistinct from the \"livery colours\" of the arms. It is difficult to check\r\nthis rule, because our knowledge of the liveries in use in early days is so\r\nmeagre and limited; but in the few instances of which we now have knowledge\r\nwe look in vain for a repetition of the colours worn by the retainers as\r\nliveries in the mantlings used. The fact that the livery colours are\r\nrepresented in the background of some of the early Garter plates, and that\r\nin such instances in no single case do they agree with the colours of the\r\nmantling, must certainly dissipate once and for all any such supposition as\r\nfar as it relates to that period.\r\n\r\nA careful study and analysis of early heraldic emblazonment, however,\r\nreveals one point as a dominating characteristic. That is, that where the\r\ncrest, by its nature, lent itself to a continuation into the mantling it\r\ngenerally was so continued. This practice, which was almost universal upon\r\nthe Continent, and is particularly to be met with {386} in German heraldry,\r\nthough seldom adopted in England, certainly had some weight in English\r\nheraldry. In the recently published reproductions of the Plantagenet Garter\r\nplates eighty-seven armorial achievements are included. Of these, in ten\r\ninstances the mantlings are plainly continuations of the crests, being\r\n\"feathered\" or in unison. Fifteen of the mantlings have both the outside\r\nand the inside of the principal colour and of the principal metal of the\r\narms they accompany, though in a few cases, contrary to the present\r\npractice, the metal is outside, the lining being of the colour. Nineteen\r\nmore of the mantlings are of the principal colour of the arms, the majority\r\n(eighteen) of these being lined with ermine. No less than forty-nine are of\r\nsome colour lined with ermine, but thirty-four of these are of gules lined\r\nermine, and in the large majority of cases in these thirty-four instances\r\nneither the gules nor the ermine are in conformity with the principal\r\ncolour and metal (what we now term the \"livery colours\") of the arms. In\r\nsome cases the colours of the mantling agree with the colours of the crest,\r\na rule which will usually be found to hold good in German heraldry. The\r\nconstant occurrence of gules and ermine incline one much to believe that\r\nthe colours of the mantling were not decided by haphazard fancy, but that\r\nthere was some law--possibly in some way connected with the sumptuary laws\r\nof the period--which governed the matter, or, at any rate, which greatly\r\nlimited the range of selection. Of the eighty-seven mantlings, excluding\r\nthose which are gules lined ermine, there are four only the colours of\r\nwhich apparently bear no relation whatever to the colours of the arms or\r\nthe crests appearing upon the same Stall plate. In some number of the\r\nplates the colours certainly are taken from a quartering other than the\r\nfirst one, and in one at least of the four exceptions the mantling (one of\r\nthe most curious examples) is plainly derived from a quartering inherited\r\nby the knight in question though not shown upon the Stall plate. Probably a\r\ncloser examination of the remaining three instances would reveal a similar\r\nreason in each case. That any law concerning the colours of their mantlings\r\nwas enforced upon those concerned would be an unwarrantable deduction not\r\njustified by the instances under examination, but one is clearly justified\r\nin drawing from these cases some deductions as to the practice pursued. It\r\nis evident that unless one was authorised by the rule or reason governing\r\nthe matter--whatever such rule or reason may have been--in using a mantling\r\nof gules and ermine, the dominating colour (not as a rule the metal) of the\r\ncoat of arms (or of one of the quarterings), or sometimes of the crest if\r\nthe tinctures of arms and crest were not in unison, decided the colour of\r\nthe mantling. That there was some meaning behind the mantlings of gules\r\nlined with ermine there can be little doubt, for it is noticeable that in a\r\ncase in {387} which the colours of the arms themselves are gules and\r\nermine, the mantling is of gules and argent, as by the way in this\r\nparticular case is the chapeau upon which the crest is placed. But probably\r\nthe reason which governed these mantlings of gules lined with ermine, as\r\nalso the ermine linings of other mantlings, must be sought outside the\r\nstrict limits of armory. That the colours of mantlings are repeated in\r\ndifferent generations, and in the plates of members of the same family,\r\nclearly demonstrates that selection was not haphazard.\r\n\r\nCertain of these early Garter plates exhibit interesting curiosities in the\r\nmantlings:--\r\n\r\n1. Sir William Latimer, Lord Latimer, K.G., c. 1361-1381. Arms: gules a\r\ncross patonce or. Crest: a plume of feathers sable, the tips or. Mantling\r\ngules with silver vertical stripes, lined with ermine.\r\n\r\n2. Sir Bermond Arnaud de Presac, Soudan de la Tran, K.G., 1380-_post_ 1384.\r\nArms: or, a lion rampant double-queued gules. Crest: a Midas' head argent.\r\nMantling sable, lined gules, the latter veined or.\r\n\r\n3. Sir Simon Felbrigge, K.G., 1397-1442. Arms: or, a lion rampant gules.\r\nCrest: out of a coronet gules, a plume of feathers ermine. Mantling ermine,\r\nlined gules (evidently a continuation of the crest).\r\n\r\n4. Sir Reginald Cobham, Lord Cobham, K.G., 1352-1361. Arms: gules, on a\r\nchevron or, three estoiles sable. Crest: a soldan's head sable, the brow\r\nencircled by a torse or. Mantling sable (evidently a continuation of the\r\ncrest), lined gules.\r\n\r\n5. Sir Edward Cherleton, Lord Cherleton of Powis, K.G., 1406-7 to 1420-1.\r\nArms: or, a lion rampant gules. Crest: on a wreath gules and sable, two\r\nlions' gambs also gules, each adorned on the exterior side with three\r\ndemi-fleurs-de-lis issuing argent, the centres thereof or. Mantling: on the\r\ndexter side, sable; on the sinister side, gules; both lined ermine.\r\n\r\n6. Sir Hertong von Clux, K.G., 1421-1445 or 6. Arms: argent, a vine branch\r\ncouped at either end in bend sable. Crest: out of a coronet or, a plume of\r\nfeathers sable and argent. Mantling: on the dexter side, azure; on the\r\nsinister, gules; both lined ermine.\r\n\r\n7. Sir Miles Stapleton, K.G. (Founder Knight, died 1364). Arms: argent, a\r\nlion rampant sable. Crest: a soldan's head sable, around the temples a\r\ntorse azure, tied in a knot, the ends flowing. Mantling sable (probably a\r\ncontinuation of the crest), lined gules.\r\n\r\n8. Sir Walter Hungerford, Lord Hungerford and Heytesbury, K.G., 1421-1449.\r\nArms: sable, two bars argent, and in chief three plates. Crest: out of a\r\ncoronet azure a garb or, enclosed by two sickles argent. Mantling (within\r\nand without): dexter, barry of six {388} ermine and gules; sinister, barry\r\nof six gules and ermine. (The reason of this is plain. The mother of Lord\r\nHungerford was a daughter and coheir of Hussey. The arms of Hussey are\r\nvariously given: \"Barry of six ermine and gules,\" or \"Ermine, three bars\r\ngules.\")\r\n\r\n9. Sir Humphrey Stafford, Earl of Stafford, 1429-1460. Arms: or, a chevron\r\ngules. Crest: out of a coronet gules, a swan's head and neck proper, beaked\r\ngules, between two wings also proper. Mantling: the dexter side, sable; the\r\nsinister side, gules; both lined ermine. Black and gules, it may be noted,\r\nwere the livery colours of Buckingham, an earldom which had devolved upon\r\nthe Earls of Stafford.\r\n\r\n10. Sir John Grey of Ruthin, K.G., 1436-1439. Arms: quarterly, 1 and 4,\r\nbarry of six argent and azure, in chief three torteaux; 2 and 3, quarterly\r\ni. and iiii., or, a maunch gules; ii. and iii., barry of eight argent and\r\nazure, an orle of ten martlets gules; over all a label of three points\r\nargent. Crest: on a chapeau gules, turned up ermine, a wyvern or, gorged\r\nwith a label argent. Mantling or, lined ermine.\r\n\r\n11. Sir Richard Nevill, Earl of Salisbury, K.G., 1436-1460. Arms:\r\nquarterly, 1 and 4, quarterly i. and iiii., argent, three lozenges\r\nconjoined in fess gules; ii. and iii., or, an eagle displayed vert; 2 and\r\n3, gules, a saltire argent, a label of three points compony argent and\r\nazure. Crest: on a coronet, a griffin sejant, with wings displayed or.\r\nMantling: dexter side, gules; the sinister, sable; both lined ermine.\r\n\r\n12. Sir Gaston de Foix, Count de Longueville, &c., K.G., 1438-1458. Arms:\r\nquarterly, 1 and 4, or, three pallets gules; 2 and 3, or, two cows passant\r\nin pale gules, over all a label of three points, each point or, on a cross\r\nsable five escallops argent. Crest: on a wreath or and gules, a\r\nblackamoor's bust with ass's ears sable, vested paly or and gules, all\r\nbetween two wings, each of the arms as in the first quarter. Mantling paly\r\nof or and gules, lined vert.\r\n\r\n13. Sir Walter Blount, Lord Mountjoye, K.G., 1472-1474. Arms: quarterly, 1.\r\nargent, two wolves passant in pale sable, on a bordure also argent eight\r\nsaltires couped gules (for Ayala); 2. or, a tower (? gules) (for Mountjoy);\r\n3. barry nebuly or and sable (for Blount); 4. vairé argent and gules (for\r\nGresley). Crest: out of a coronet two ibex horns or. Mantling sable, lined\r\non the dexter side with argent, and on the sinister with or.\r\n\r\n14. Frederick, Duke of Urbino. Mantling or, lined ermine.\r\n\r\nIn Continental heraldry it is by no means uncommon to find the device of\r\nthe arms repeated either wholly or in part upon the mantling. In reference\r\nto this the \"Tournament Rules\" of René, Duke of Anjou, {389} throw some\r\nlight on the point. These it may be of interest to quote:--\r\n\r\n    \"Vous tous Princes, Seigneurs, Barons, Cheualiers, et Escuyers, qui\r\n    auez intention de tournoyer, vous estes tenus vous rendre és heberges\r\n    le quartrième jour deuan le jour du Tournoy, pour faire de vos Blasons\r\n    fenestres, sur payne de non estre receus audit Tournoy. Les armes\r\n    seront celles-cy. Le tymbre doit estre sur vne piece de cuir boüilly,\r\n    la quelle doit estre bien faultrée d'vn doigt d'espez, ou plus, par le\r\n    dedans: et doit contenir la dite piece de cuir tout le sommet du\r\n    heaulme, et sera couuerte la dite piece du lambrequin armoyé des armes\r\n    de celuy qui le portera, et sur le dit lambrequin au plus haut du\r\n    sommet, sera assis le dit Tymbre, et autour d'iceluy aura vn tortil des\r\n    couleurs que voudra le Tournoyeur.\r\n\r\n    \"Item, et quand tous les heaulmes seront ainsi mis et ordonnez pour les\r\n    departir, viendront toutes Dames et Damoiselles et tout Seigneurs,\r\n    Cheualiers, et Escuyers, en les visitant d'vn bout à autre, la present\r\n    les Juges, qui meneront trois ou quatre tours les Dames pour bien voir\r\n    et visiter les Tymbres, et y aura vu Heraut ou poursuivant, qui dira\r\n    aux Dames selon l'endroit où elles seront, le nom de ceux à qui sont\r\n    les Tymbres, afin que s'il en a qui ait des Dames médit, et elles\r\n    touchent son Tymbre, qu'il soit le lendemain pour recommandé.\"\r\n    (Menêtrier, _L'Origine des Armoiries_, pp. 79-81.)\r\n\r\nWhilst one can call to mind no instance of importance of ancient date where\r\nthis practice has been followed in this country, there are one or two\r\ninstances in the Garter plates which approximate closely to it. The\r\nmantling of John, Lord Beaumont, is azure, semé-de-lis (as the field of his\r\narms), lined ermine. Those of Sir John Bourchier, Lord Berners, and of Sir\r\nHenry Bourchier, Earl of Essex, are of gules, billetté or, evidently\r\nderived from the quartering for Louvaine upon the arms, this quartering\r\nbeing: \"Gules, billetté and a fess or.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to a MS. of Vincent, in the College of Arms, the Warrens used a\r\nmantling chequy of azure and or with their arms.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar result is obtained by the mantling, \"Gules, semé of\r\nlozenges or,\" upon the small plate of Sir Sanchet Dabrichecourt. The\r\nmantling of Sir Lewis Robessart, Lord Bourchier, is: \"Azure, bezanté, lined\r\nargent.\"\r\n\r\n\"The azure mantling on the Garter Plate of Henry V., as Prince of Wales, is\r\n'semé of the French golden fleurs-de-lis.'... The Daubeny mantling is 'semé\r\nof mullets.' On the brass of Sir John Wylcote, at Tew, the lambrequins are\r\nchequy.... On the seals of Sir John Bussy, in 1391 and 1407, the mantlings\r\nare barry, the coat being 'argent, three bars sable.'\"\r\n\r\nThere are a few cases amongst the Garter plates in which badges are plainly\r\nand unmistakably depicted upon the mantlings. Thus, on the lining of the\r\nmantling on the plate of Sir Henry Bourchier (elected 1452) will be found\r\nwater-bougets, which are repeated on a fillet round the head of the crest.\r\nThe Stall plate of Sir John Bourchier, Lord {390} Berners, above referred\r\nto (elected 1459), is lined with silver on the dexter side, semé in the\r\nupper part with water-bougets, and in the lower part with Bourchier knots.\r\nOn the opposite side of the mantling the knots are in the upper part, and\r\nthe water-bougets below. That these badges upon the mantling are not\r\nhaphazard artistic decoration is proved by a reference to the monumental\r\neffigy of the Earl of Essex, in Little Easton Church, Essex. The differing\r\nshapes of the helmet, and of the coronet and the mantling, and the\r\ndifferent representation of the crest, show that, although depicted in his\r\nGarter robes, upon his effigy the helmet, crest, and mantling upon which\r\nthe earl's head there rests, and the representations of the same upon the\r\nGarter plate, are not slavish copies of the same original model.\r\nNevertheless upon the effigy, as on the Garter plate, we find the outside\r\nof the mantling \"semé of billets,\" and the inside \"semé of water-bougets.\"\r\nAnother instance amongst the Garter plates will be found in the case of\r\nViscount Lovell, whose mantling is strewn with gold padlocks.\r\n\r\nNearly all the mantlings on the Garter Stall plates are more or less\r\nheavily \"veined\" with gold, and many are heavily diapered and decorated\r\nwith floral devices. So prominent is some of this floral diapering that one\r\nis inclined to think that in a few cases it may possibly be a diapering\r\nwith floral badges. In other cases it is equally evidently no more than a\r\nmere accessory of design, though between these two classes of diapering it\r\nwould be by no means easy to draw a line of distinction. The veining and\r\n\"heightening\" of a mantling with gold is at the present day nearly always\r\nto be seen in elaborate heraldic painting.\r\n\r\nFrom the Garter plates of the fourteenth century it has been shown that the\r\ncolours of a large proportion of the mantlings approximated in early days\r\nto the colours of the arms. The popularity of gules, however, was then fast\r\nencroaching upon the frequency of appearance which other colours should\r\nhave enjoyed; and in the sixteenth century, in grants and other paintings\r\nof arms, the use of a mantling of gules had become practically universal.\r\nIn most cases the mantling of \"gules, doubled argent\" forms an integral\r\npart of the terms of the grant itself, as sometimes do the \"gold tassels\"\r\nwhich are so frequently found terminating the mantlings of that and an\r\nearlier period. This custom continued through the Stuart period, and though\r\ndropped officially in England during the eighteenth century (when the\r\nmantling reverted to the livery colours of the arms, and became in this\r\nform a matter of course and so understood, not being expressed in the\r\nwording of the patent), it continued in force in Lyon Office in Scotland\r\nuntil the year 1890, when the present Lyon King of Arms (Sir James Balfour\r\nPaul) altered the practice, and, as had earlier been done in England, {391}\r\nordered that all future Scottish mantlings should be depicted in the livery\r\ncolours of the arms, but in Scotland the mantlings, though now following\r\nthe livery colours, are still included in the terms of the grant, and\r\nthereby stereotyped. In England, in an official \"exemplification\" at the\r\npresent day of an ancient coat of arms (_e.g._ in an exemplification\r\nfollowing the assumption of name and arms by Royal License), the mantling\r\nis painted in the livery colours, irrespective of any ancient patent in\r\nwhich \"gules and argent\" may have been _granted_ as the colour of the\r\nmantling. Though probably most people will agree as to the expediency of\r\nsuch a practice, it is at any rate open to criticism on the score of\r\npropriety, unless the new mantling is expressed in terms in the new patent.\r\nThis would of course amount to a grant overriding the earlier one, and\r\nwould do all that was necessary; but failing this, there appears to be a\r\ndistinct hiatus in the continuity of authority.\r\n\r\nErmine linings to the mantling were soon denied to the undistinguished\r\ncommoner, and with the exception of the early Garter plates, it would be\r\ndifficult to point to an instance of their use. The mantlings of peers,\r\nhowever, continued to be lined with ermine, and English instances under\r\nofficial sanction can be found in the Visitation Books and in the Garter\r\nplates until a comparatively recent period. In fact the relegation of peers\r\nto the ordinary livery colours for their mantlings is, in England, quite a\r\nmodern practice. In Scotland, however, the mantlings of peers have always\r\nbeen lined with ermine, and the present Lyon continues this whilst usually\r\nmaking the colours of the outside of the mantlings agree with the principal\r\ncolour of the arms. This, as regards the outer colour of the mantling, is\r\nnot a fixed or stereotyped rule, and in some cases Lyon has preferred to\r\nadopt a mantling of gules lined with ermine as more comformable to a peer's\r\nParliamentary Robe of Estate.\r\n\r\nIn the Deputy Earl-Marshal's warrant referred to on page 375 are some\r\ninteresting points as to the mantling. It is recited that \"some persons\r\nunder y^e degree of y^e Nobilitie of this Realme doe cause Ermins to be\r\nDepicted upon ye Lineings of those Mantles which are used with their Armes,\r\nand also that there are some that have lately caused the Mantles of their\r\nArmes to be painted like Ostrich feathers as tho' they were of some\r\npeculiar and superior degree of Honor,\" and the warrant commands that these\r\npoints are to be rectified.\r\n\r\nThe Royal mantling is of cloth of gold. In the case of the sovereign and\r\nthe Prince of Wales it is lined with ermine, and for other members of the\r\nRoyal Family it is lined with argent. Queen Elizabeth was the first\r\nsovereign to adopt the golden mantling, the Royal tinctures before that\r\ndate (for the mantling) being gules lined ermine. The mantling of or and\r\nermine has, of course, since that date been rigidly denied to {392} all\r\noutside the Royal Family. Two instances, however, occur amongst the early\r\nGarter plates, viz. Sir John Grey de Ruthyn and Frederick, Duke of Urbino.\r\nIt is sometimes stated that a mantling of or and ermine is a sign of\r\nsovereignty, but the mantling of our own sovereign is really the only case\r\nin which it is presently so used.\r\n\r\nIn Sweden, as in Scotland, the colours of the mantling are specified in the\r\npatent, and, unlike our own, are often curiously varied.\r\n\r\nThe present rules for the colour of a mantling are as follows in England\r\nand Ireland:--\r\n\r\n    1. That with ancient arms of which the grant specified the colour,\r\n    where this has not been altered by a subsequent exemplification, the\r\n    colours must be as stated in the grant, _i.e._ usually gules, lined\r\n    argent.\r\n\r\n    2. That the mantling of the sovereign and Prince of Wales is of cloth\r\n    of gold, lined with ermine.\r\n\r\n    3. That the mantling of other members of the Royal Family is of cloth\r\n    of gold lined with argent.\r\n\r\n    4. That the mantlings of all other people shall be of the livery\r\n    colours.\r\n\r\nThe rules in Scotland are now as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. That in the cases of peers whose arms were matriculated before 1890\r\n    the mantling is of gules lined with ermine (the Scottish term for\r\n    \"lined\" is \"doubled\").\r\n\r\n    2. That the mantlings of all other arms matriculated before 1890 shall\r\n    be of gules and argent.\r\n\r\n    3. That the mantlings of peers whose arms have been matriculated since\r\n    1890 shall be either of the principal colour of the arms, lined with\r\n    ermine, or of gules lined ermine (conformably to the Parliamentary Robe\r\n    of Estate of a peer) as may happen to have been matriculated.\r\n\r\n    4. That the mantlings of all other persons whose arms have been\r\n    matriculated since 1890 shall be of the livery colours, unless other\r\n    colours are, as is occasionally the case, specified in the patent of\r\n    matriculation.\r\n\r\nWhether in Scotland a person is entitled to assume of his own motion an\r\nermine lining to his mantling upon his elevation to the peerage, without a\r\nrematriculation in cases where the arms and mantling have been otherwise\r\nmatriculated at an earlier date, or whether in England any peer may still\r\nline his mantling with ermine, are points on which one hesitates to express\r\nan opinion.\r\n\r\nWhen the mantling is of the livery colours the following rules must be\r\nobserved. The outside must be of some colour and the lining of some metal.\r\nThe colour must be the principal colour of the arms, {393} _i.e._ the\r\ncolour of the field if it be of colour, or if it is of metal, then the\r\ncolour of the principal ordinary or charge upon the shield. The metal will\r\nbe as the field, if the field is of metal, or if not, it will be as the\r\nmetal of the principal ordinary or charge. In other words, it should be the\r\nsame tinctures as the wreath.\r\n\r\nIf the field is party of colour and metal (_i.e._ per pale barry,\r\nquarterly, &c.), then that colour and that metal are \"the livery colours.\"\r\nIf the field is party of two _colours_ the principal colour (_i.e._ the one\r\nfirst mentioned in the blazon) is taken as the colour and the other is\r\nignored. The mantling is _not_ made party to agree with the field in\r\nBritish heraldry, as would be the case in Germany. If the field is of a\r\nfur, then the dominant metal or colour of the fur is taken as one component\r\npart of the \"livery colours,\" the other metal or colour required being\r\ntaken from the next most important tincture of the field. For example,\r\n\"ermine, a fess gules\" has a mantling of gules and argent, whilst \"or, a\r\nchevron ermines\" would need a mantling of sable and or. The mantling for\r\n\"azure, a lion rampant erminois\" would be azure and or. But in a coat\r\nshowing fur, metal, and colour, sometimes the fur is ignored. A field of\r\nvair has a mantling argent and azure, but if the charge be vair the field\r\nwill supply the one, _i.e._ either colour or metal, whilst the vair\r\nsupplies whichever is lacking. Except in the cases of Scotsmen who are\r\npeers and of the Sovereign and Prince of Wales, no fur is ever used\r\nnowadays in Great Britain for a mantling.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the principal charge is \"proper,\" a certain discretion must\r\nbe used. Usually the heraldic colour to which the charge approximates is\r\nused. For example, \"argent, issuing from a mount in base a tree proper,\"\r\n&c., would have a mantling vert and argent. The arms \"or, three Cornish\r\nchoughs proper,\" or \"argent, three negroes' heads couped proper,\" would\r\nhave mantlings respectively sable and or and sable and argent. Occasionally\r\none comes across a coat which supplies an \"impossible\" mantling, or which\r\ndoes not supply one at all. Such a coat would be \"per bend sinister ermine\r\nand erminois, a lion rampant counterchanged.\" Here there is no colour at\r\nall, so the mantling would be gules and argent. \"Argent, three stags\r\ntrippant proper\" would have a mantling gules and argent. A coat of arms\r\nwith a landscape field would also probably be supplied (in default of a\r\nchief, _e.g._ supplying other colours and tinctures) with a mantling gules\r\nand argent. It is quite permissible to \"vein\" a mantling with gold lines,\r\nthis being always done in official paintings.\r\n\r\nIn English official heraldry, where, no matter how great the number of\r\ncrests, one helmet only is painted, it naturally follows that one mantling\r\nonly can be depicted. This is always taken from the livery colours of the\r\nchief (_i.e._ the first) quartering or sub-quartering. {394} In Scottish\r\npatents at the present day in which a helmet is painted for each crest the\r\nmantlings frequently vary, being in each case in accordance with the livery\r\ncolours of the quartering to which the crest belongs. Consequently this\r\nmust be accepted as the rule in cases where more than one helmet is shown.\r\n\r\nIn considering the fashionings of mantlings it must be remembered that\r\nstyles and fashions much overlap, and there has always been the tendency in\r\narmory to repeat earlier styles. Whilst one willingly concedes the immense\r\ngain in beauty by the present reversion in heraldic art to older and\r\nbetter, and certainly more artistic types, there is distinctly another side\r\nto the question which is strangely overlooked by those who would have the\r\npresent-day heraldic art slavishly copied in all minutiæ of detail, and\r\neven (according to some) in all the crudity of draughtmanship from examples\r\nof the earliest periods.\r\n\r\nHitherto each period of heraldic art has had its own peculiar style and\r\ntype, each within limits readily recognisable. Whether that style and type\r\ncan be considered when judged by the canons of art to be good or bad, there\r\ncan be no doubt that each style in its turn has approximated to, and has\r\nbeen in keeping with, the concurrent decorative art outside and beyond\r\nheraldry, though it has always exhibited a tendency to rather lag behind.\r\nWhen all has been said and done that can be, heraldry, in spite of its\r\nsymbolism and its many other meanings, remains but a form of decorative\r\nart; and therefore it is natural that it should be influenced by other\r\nartistic ideas and other manifestations of art and accepted forms of design\r\ncurrent at the period to which it belongs. For, from the artistic point of\r\nview, the part played in art by heraldry is so limited in extent compared\r\nwith the part occupied by other forms of decoration, that one would\r\nnaturally expect heraldry to show the influence of outside decorative art\r\nto a greater extent than decorative art as a whole would be likely to show\r\nthe influence of heraldry. In our present revulsion of mind in favour of\r\nolder heraldic types, we are apt to speak of \"good\" or \"bad\" heraldic art.\r\nBut art itself cannot so be divided, for after all allowances have been\r\nmade for crude workmanship, and when bad or imperfect examples have been\r\neliminated from consideration (and given always necessarily the essential\r\nbasis of the relation of line to curve and such technical details of art),\r\nwho on earth is to judge, or who is competent to say, whether any\r\nparticular style of art is good or bad? No one from preference executes\r\nspeculative art which he knows whilst executing it to be bad. Most\r\nmanifestations of art, and peculiarly of decorative art, are commercial\r\nmatters executed with the frank idea of subsequent sale, and consequently\r\nwith the subconscious idea, true though but seldom acknowledged, of\r\npleasing that public which will {395} have to buy. Consequently the\r\nultimate appeal is to the taste of the public, for art, if it be not the\r\ndesire to give pleasure by the representation of beauty, is nothing.\r\nBeauty, of course, must not necessarily be confounded with prettiness; it\r\nmay be beauty of character. The result is, therefore, that the decorative\r\nart of any period is an indication of that which gives pleasure at the\r\nmoment, and an absolute reflex of the artistic wishes, desires, and tastes\r\nof the cultivated classes to whom executive art must appeal. At every\r\nperiod it has been found that this taste is constantly changing, and as a\r\nconsequence the examples of decorative art of any period are a reflex only\r\nof the artistic ideas current at the time the work was done.\r\n\r\nAt all periods, therefore, even during the early Victorian period, which we\r\nare now taught and believe to be the most ghastly period through which\r\nEnglish art has passed, the art in vogue has been what the public have\r\nadmired, and have been ready to pay for, and most emphatically what they\r\nhave been taught and brought up to consider good art. In early Victorian\r\ndays there was no lack of educated people, and because they liked the\r\nparticular form of decoration associated with their period, who is\r\njustified in saying that, because that peculiar style of decoration is not\r\nacceptable now to ourselves, their art was bad, and worse than our own? If\r\nthroughout the ages there had been one dominating style of decoration\r\nequally accepted at all periods and by all authorities as the highest type\r\nof decorative art, then we should have some standard to judge by. Such is\r\nnot the case, and we have no such standard, and any attempt to arbitrarily\r\ncreate and control ideas between given parallel lines of arbitrary thought,\r\nwhen the ideas are constantly changing, is impossible and undesirable. Who\r\ndreams of questioning the art of Benvenuto Cellini, or of describing his\r\ncraftsmanship as other than one of the most vivid examples of his period,\r\nand yet what had it in keeping with the art of the Louis XVI. period, or\r\nthe later art of William Morris and his followers? Widely divergent as are\r\nthese types, they are nevertheless all accepted as the highest expressions\r\nof three separate types of decorative art. Any one attempting to compare\r\nthem, or to rank these schools of artistic thought in order of superiority,\r\nwould simply be laying themselves open to ridicule unspeakable, for they\r\nwould be ranked by the highest authorities of different periods in\r\ndifferent orders, and it is as impossible to create a permanent standard of\r\nart as it is impossible to ensure a permanence of any particular public\r\ntaste. The fact that taste changes, and as a consequence that artistic\r\nstyles and types vary, is simply due to the everlasting desire on the part\r\nof the public for some new thing, and their equally permanent appreciation\r\nof novelty of idea or sensation. That master-minds have arisen to teach,\r\nand {396} that they have taught with some success their own particular\r\nbrand of art to the public, would seem rather to argue against the\r\nforegoing ideas were it not that, when the master-mind and the dominating\r\ninfluence are gone, the public, desiring as always change and novelty, are\r\nready to fly to any new teacher and master who can again afford them\r\nartistic pleasure. The influence of William Morris in household decoration\r\nis possibly the most far-reaching modern example of the influence of a\r\nsingle man upon the art of his period; but master-mind as was his, and\r\nmaster-craftsman as he was, it has needed but a few years since his death\r\nto start the undoing of much that he taught. After the movement initiated\r\nby Morris and carried further by the Arts and Crafts Society, which made\r\nfor simplicity in structural design as well as in the decoration of\r\nfurniture, we have now fallen back upon the flowery patterns of the early\r\nVictorian period, and there is hardly a drawing-room in fashionable London\r\nwhere the chairs and settees are not covered with early Victorian chintzes.\r\n\r\nArtistic authorities may shout themselves hoarse, but the fashion having\r\nbeen set in Mayfair will be inevitably followed in Suburbia, and we are\r\ndoubtless again at the beginning of the cycle of that curious manifestation\r\nof domestic decorative art which was current in the early part of the\r\nnineteenth century. It is, therefore, evident that it is futile to describe\r\nvarying types of art of varying periods as good or bad, or to differentiate\r\nbetween them, unless some such permanent basis of comparison or standard of\r\nexcellence be conceded. The differing types must be accepted as no more\r\nthan the expression of the artistic period to which they belong. That being\r\nso, one cannot help thinking that the abuse which has been heaped of late\r\n(by unthinking votaries of Plantagenet and Tudor heraldry) upon heraldic\r\nart in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries has very\r\ngreatly overstepped the true proportion of the matter. Much that has been\r\nsaid is true, but what has been said too often lacks proportion. There is\r\nconsequently much to be said in favour of allowing each period to create\r\nits own style and type of heraldic design, in conformity with the ideas\r\nconcerning decorative art which are current outside heraldic thought. This\r\nis precisely what is not happening at the present time, even with all our\r\nboasted revival of armory and armorial art. The tendency at the present\r\ntime is to slavishly copy examples of other periods. There is another point\r\nwhich is usually overlooked by the most blatant followers of this school of\r\nthought. What are the ancient models which remain to us? The early Rolls of\r\nArms of which we hear so much are not, and were never intended to be,\r\nexamples of artistic execution. They are merely memoranda of _fact_. It is\r\nabsurd to suppose that an actual shield was painted with the crudity to be\r\nmet {397} with in the Rolls of Arms. It is equally absurd to accept as\r\nunimpeachable models, Garter plates, seals, or architectural examples\r\nunless the purpose and medium--wax, enamel, or stone--in which they are\r\nexecuted is borne in mind, and the knowledge used with due discrimination.\r\nMr. Eve, without slavishly copying, originally appears to have modelled his\r\nwork upon the admirable designs and ideas of the \"little masters\" of German\r\nart in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. He has since progressed\r\ntherefrom to a distinctive and very excellent style of his own. Mr. Graham\r\nJohnson models his work upon Plantagenet and Tudor examples. The work of\r\nPère Anselm, and of Pugin, the first start towards the present ideas of\r\nheraldic art, embodying as it did so much of the beauty of the older work\r\nwhilst possessing a character of its own, and developing ancient ideals by\r\nincreased beauty of execution, has placed their reputation far above that\r\nof others, who, following in their footsteps, have not possessed their\r\nabilities. But with regard to most of the heraldic design of the present\r\nday as a whole it is very evident that we are simply picking and choosing\r\ntit-bits from the work of bygone craftsmen, and copying, more or less\r\nslavishly, examples of other periods. This makes for no advance in design\r\neither, in its character or execution, nor will it result in any\r\npeculiarity of style which it will be possible in the future to identify\r\nwith the present period. Our heraldry, like our architecture, though it may\r\nbe dated in the twentieth century, will be a heterogeneous collection of\r\nisolated specimens of Gothic, Tudor, or Queen Anne style and type, which\r\nsurely is as anachronistic as we consider to be those Dutch paintings which\r\nrepresent Christ and the Apostles in modern clothes.\r\n\r\nRoughly the periods into which the types of mantlings can be divided, when\r\nconsidered from the standpoint of their fashioning, are somewhat as\r\nfollows. There is the earliest period of all, when the mantling depicted\r\napproximated closely if it was not an actual representation of the capelote\r\nreally worn in battle. Examples of this will be found in the _Armorial de\r\nGelre_ and the Zurich _Wappenrolle_. As the mantling worn lengthened and\r\nevolved itself into the lambrequin, the mantling depicted in heraldic art\r\nwas similarly increased in size, terminating in the long mantle drawn in\r\nprofile but tasselled and with the scalloped edges, a type which is found\r\nsurviving in some of the early Garter plates. This is the transition stage.\r\nThe next definite period is when we find the mantling depicted on both\r\nsides of the helmet and the scalloped edges developed, in accordance with\r\nthe romantic ideas of the period, into the slashes and cuts of the bold and\r\nartistic mantlings of Plantagenet armorial art.\r\n\r\nSlowly decreasing in strength, but at the same time increasing in\r\nelaboration, this mantling and type continued until it had reached its\r\n{398} highest pitch of exuberant elaboration in Stuart and early Georgian\r\ntimes. Side by side with this over-elaboration came the revulsion to a\r\nPuritan simplicity of taste which is to be found in other manifestations of\r\nart at the same time, and which made itself evident in heraldic decoration\r\nby the use as mantling of the plain uncut cloth suspended behind the\r\nshield. Originating in Elizabethan days, this plain cloth was much made use\r\nof, but towards the end of the Stuart period came that curious evolution of\r\nBritish heraldry which is peculiar to these countries alone. That is the\r\nentire omission of both helmet and mantling. How it originated it is\r\ndifficult to understand, unless it be due to the fact that a large number,\r\nin fact a large proportion, of English families possessed a shield only and\r\nneither claimed nor used a crest, and that consequently a large number of\r\nheraldic representations give the shield only. It is rare indeed to find a\r\nshield surmounted by helmet and mantling when the former is not required to\r\nsupport a crest. At the same time we find, among the official records of\r\nthe period, that the documents of chief importance were the Visitation\r\nBooks. In these, probably from motives of economy or to save needless\r\ndraughtsmanship, the trouble of depicting the helmet and mantling was\r\ndispensed with, and the crest is almost universally found depicted on the\r\nwreath, which is made to rest upon the shield, the helmet being omitted.\r\nThat being an accepted official way of representing an achievement, small\r\nwonder that the public followed, and we find as a consequence that a large\r\nproportion of the bookplates during the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies had no helmet or mantling at all, the elaboration of the edges of\r\nthe shield, together with the addition of decorative and needless\r\naccessories bearing no relation to the arms, fulfilling all purposes of\r\ndecorative design. It should also be remembered that from towards the close\r\nof the Stuart period onward, England was taking her art and decoration\r\nalmost entirely from Continental sources, chiefly French and Italian. In\r\nboth the countries the use of crests was very limited indeed in extent, and\r\nthe elimination of the helmet and mantling, and the elaboration in their\r\nstead of the edges of the shield, we probably owe to the effort to\r\nassimilate French and Italian forms of decoration to English arms. So\r\nobsolete had become the use of helmet and mantling that it is difficult to\r\ncome across examples that one can put forward as mantlings typical of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nHelmets and mantlings were of course painted upon grants and upon the Stall\r\nplates of the knights of the various orders, but whilst the helmets became\r\nweak, of a pattern impossible to wear, and small in size, the mantling\r\nbecame of a stereotyped pattern, and of a design poor and wooden according\r\nto our present ideas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 665.--Carriage Panel of Georgiana, Marchioness of\r\nCholmondeley.]\r\n\r\nUnofficial heraldry had sunk to an even lower style of art, and {399} the\r\nregulation heraldic stationer's types of shield, mantling, and helmet are\r\nawe-inspiring in their ugliness.\r\n\r\nThe term \"mantle\" is sometimes employed, but it would seem hardly quite\r\ncorrectly, to the parliamentary robe of estate upon which the arms of a\r\npeer of the realm were so frequently depicted at the end of the eighteenth\r\nand in the early part of the nineteenth centuries. Its popularity is an\r\nindication of the ever-constant predilection for something which is denied\r\nto others and the possession of which is a matter of privilege. Woodward,\r\nin his \"Treatise on Heraldry,\" treats of and dismisses the matter in one\r\nshort sentence: \"In England the suggestion that the arms of peers should be\r\nmantled with their Parliament robes was never generally adopted.\" In this\r\nstatement he is quite incorrect, for as the accepted type in one particular\r\nopportunity of armorial display its use was absolutely universal. The\r\nopportunity in question was the emblazonment of arms upon carriage panels.\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth and at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncenturies armorial bearings were painted of some size upon carriages, and\r\nthere were few such paintings executed for the carriages, chariots, and\r\nstate coaches of peers that did not appear upon a background of the robe of\r\nestate. With the modern craze for ostentatious unostentation (the result,\r\nthere can be little doubt, in this respect of the wholesale appropriation\r\nof arms by those without a right to bear these ornaments), the decoration\r\nof a peer's carriage nowadays seldom shows more than a simple coronet, or a\r\ncoroneted crest, initial, or monogram; but the State chariots of those who\r\nstill possess them almost all, without exception, show the arms emblazoned\r\nupon the robe of estate. The Royal and many other State chariots made or\r\nrefurbished for the recent coronation ceremonies show that, when an\r\nopportunity of the fullest display properly arises, the robe of estate is\r\nnot yet a thing of the past. Fig. 665 is from a photograph of a carriage\r\npanel, and shows the arms of a former Marchioness of Cholmondeley displayed\r\nin this manner. Incidentally it also shows a practice frequently resorted\r\nto, but quite unauthorised, of taking one supporter from the husband's\r\nshield and the other (when the wife was an heiress) from the arms of her\r\nfamily. The arms are those of Georgiana Charlotte, widow of George James,\r\nfirst Marquess of Cholmondeley, and younger daughter and coheir of\r\nPeregrine, third Duke of Ancaster. She became a widow in 1827 and died in\r\n1838, so the panel must have been painted between those dates. The arms\r\nshown are: \"Quarterly, 1 and 4, gules, in chief two esquires' helmets\r\nproper, and in base a garb or (for Cholmondeley); 2. gules, a chevron\r\nbetween three eagles' heads erased argent; 3. or, on a fesse between two\r\nchevrons sable, three cross crosslets or (for Walpole), and on an {400}\r\nescutcheon of pretence the arms of Bertie, namely: argent, three\r\nbattering-rams fesswise in pale proper, headed and garnished azure.\" The\r\nsupporters shown are: \"Dexter, a griffin sable, armed, winged, and membered\r\nor (from the Cholmondeley achievement); sinister, a friar vested in russet\r\nwith staff and rosary or\" (one of the supporters belonging to the Barony of\r\nWilloughby D'Eresby, to which the Marchioness of Cholmondeley in her own\r\nright was a coheir until the abeyance in the Barony was determined in\r\nfavour of her elder sister).\r\n\r\n\"In later times the arms of sovereigns--the German Electors, &c.--were\r\nmantled, usually with crimson velvet fringed with gold, lined with ermine,\r\nand crowned; but the mantling armoyé was one of the marks of dignity used\r\nby the Pairs de France, and by Cardinals resident in France; it was also\r\nemployed by some great nobles in other countries. The mantling of the\r\nPrinces and Dukes of Mirandola was chequy argent and azure, lined with\r\nermine. In France the mantling of the Chancelier was of cloth of gold; that\r\nof Présidents, of scarlet, lined with alternate strips of ermine and _petit\r\ngris_. In France, Napoleon I., who used a mantling of purple semé of golden\r\nbees, decreed that the princes and grand dignitaries should use an azure\r\nmantling thus semé; those of Dukes were to be plain, and lined with vair\r\ninstead of ermine. In 1817 a mantling of azure, fringed with gold and lined\r\nwith ermine, was appropriated to the dignity of Pair de France.\"\r\n\r\nThe pavilion is a feature of heraldic art which is quite unknown to British\r\nheraldry, and one can call to mind no single instance of its use in this\r\ncountry; but as its use is very prominent in Germany and other countries,\r\nit cannot be overlooked. It is confined to the arms of sovereigns, and the\r\npavilion is the tent-like erection within which the heraldic achievement is\r\ndisplayed. The pavilion seems to have originated in France, where it can be\r\ntraced back upon the Great Seals of the kings to its earliest form and\r\nappearance upon the seal of Louis XI. In the case of the Kings of France,\r\nit was of azure semé-de-lis or. The pavilion used with the arms of the\r\nGerman Emperor is of gold semé alternately of Imperial crowns and eagles\r\ndisplayed sable, and is lined with ermine. The motto is carried on a\r\ncrimson band, and it is surmounted by the Imperial crown, and a banner of\r\nthe German colours gules, argent, and sable. The pavilion used by the\r\nGerman Emperor as King of Prussia is of crimson, semé of black eagles and\r\ngold crowns, and the band which carries the motto is blue. The pavilions of\r\nthe King of Bavaria and the Duke of Baden, the King of Saxony, the Duke of\r\nHesse, the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach,\r\nthe Duke of {401} SaxeMeiningen-Hildburghausen, the Duke of Saxe-Altenburg,\r\nand the Duke of Anhalt are all of crimson.\r\n\r\nIn German heraldry a rather more noticeable distinction is drawn than with\r\nourselves between the lambrequin (_Helmdecke_) and the mantle\r\n(_Helmmantel_). This more closely approximates to the robe of estate,\r\nthough the _helmmantel_ has not in Germany the rigid significance of\r\npeerage degree that the robe of estate has in this country. The German\r\n_helmmantel_ with few exceptions is always of purple lined with ermine, and\r\nwhilst the mantel always falls directly from the coronet or cap, the\r\npavilion is arranged in a dome-like form which bears the crown upon its\r\nsummit. The pavilion is supposed to be the invention of the Frenchman\r\nPhilip Moreau (1680), and found its way from France to Germany, where both\r\nin the Greater and Lesser Courts it was enthusiastically adopted. Great\r\nBritain, Austria-Hungary, Spain, Portugal, and Würtemberg are the only\r\nRoyal Arms in which the pavilion does not figure. {402}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE TORSE, OR WREATH\r\n\r\nThe actual helmet, from the very _earliest_ heraldic representations which\r\nhave come down to us, would sometimes appear not to have had any mantling,\r\nthe crest being affixed direct to the (then) flat top of the helmet in use.\r\nBut occasional crests appear very early in the existence of \"ordered\"\r\narmory, and at much about the same time we find the \"textile\" covering of\r\nthe helmet coming into heraldic use. In the earliest times we find that\r\nfrequently the crest itself was continued into the mantling. But where this\r\nwas not possible, the attaching of the crest to the helmet when the\r\nmantling intervened left an unsightly joining. The unsightliness very soon\r\ncalled forth a remedy. At first this remedy took the form of a coronet or a\r\nplain fillet or ribbon round the point of juncture, sometimes with and\r\nsometimes without the ends being visible. If the ends were shown they were\r\nrepresented as floating behind, sometimes with and sometimes without a\r\nrepresentation of the bow or knot in which they were tied. The plain fillet\r\nstill continued to be used long after the torse had come into recognised\r\nuse. The consideration of crest coronets has been already included, but\r\nwith regard to the wreath an analysis of the Plantagenet Garter plates will\r\nafford some definite basis from which to start deduction.\r\n\r\nOf the eighty-six achievements reproduced in Mr. St. John Hope's book, five\r\nhave no crest. Consequently we have eighty-one examples to analyse. Of\r\nthese there are ten in which the crest is not attached to the lambrequin\r\nand helmet by anything perceptible, eight are attached with fillets of\r\nvarying widths, twenty-one crests are upon chapeaux, and twenty-nine issue\r\nfrom coronets. But at no period governed by the series is it possible that\r\neither fillet, torse, chapeau, or coronet was in use to the exclusion of\r\nanother form. This remark applies more particularly to the fillet and torse\r\n(the latter of which undoubtedly at a later date superseded the former),\r\nfor both at the beginning and at the end of the series referred to we find\r\nthe fillet and the wreath or torse, and at both periods we find crests\r\nwithout either coronet, torse, chapeau, or fillet. The fillet must soon\r\nafterwards (in the fifteenth century) have completely fallen into\r\ndesuetude. {403} The torse was so small and unimportant a matter that upon\r\nseals it would probably equally escape the attention of the engraver and\r\nthe observer, and probably there would be little to be gained by a\r\nsystematic hunt through early seals to discover the date of its\r\nintroduction, but it will be noticed that no wreaths appear in some of the\r\nearly Rolls. General Leigh says, \"In the time of Henry the Fifth, and long\r\nafter, no man had his badge set on a wreath under the degree of a knight.\r\nBut that order is worn away.\" It probably belongs to the end of the\r\nfourteenth century. There can be little doubt that its twisted shape was an\r\nevolution from the plain fillet suggested by the turban of the East. We\r\nread in the old romances, in Mallory's \"Morte d'Arthur\" and elsewhere, of\r\nvaliant knights who in battle or tournament wore the favour of some lady,\r\nor even the lady's sleeve, upon their helmets. It always used to be a\r\npuzzle to me how the sleeve could have been worn upon the helmet, and I\r\nwonder how many of the present-day novelists, who so glibly make their\r\nknightly heroes of olden time wear the \"favours\" of their lady-lovers, know\r\nhow it was done? The favour did not take the place of the crest. A knight\r\ndid not lightly discard an honoured, inherited, and known crest for the\r\nsake of wearing a favour only too frequently the mere result of a temporary\r\nflirtation; nor to wear her colours could he at short notice discard or\r\nrenew his lambrequin, surcoat, or the housings and trappings of his horse.\r\nHe simply took the favour--the colours, a ribbon, or a handkerchief of the\r\nlady, as the case might be--and twisted it in and out or over and over the\r\nfillet which surrounded the joining-place of crest and helmet. To put her\r\nfavour on his helmet was the work of a moment. The wearing of a lady's\r\nsleeve, which must have been an honour greatly prized, is of course the\r\norigin of the well-known \"maunch,\" the solitary charge in the arms of\r\nConyers, Hastings, and Wharton. Doubtless the sleeve twined with the fillet\r\nwould be made to encircle the base of the crest, and it is not unlikely\r\nthat the wide hanging mouth of the sleeve might have been used for the\r\nlambrequin. The dresses of ladies at that period were decorated with the\r\narms of their families, so in each case would be of the \"colours\" of the\r\nlady, so that the sleeve and its colours would be quickly identified, as it\r\nwas no doubt usually intended they should be. The accidental result of\r\ntwining a favour in the fillet, in conjunction with the pattern obviously\r\nsuggested by the turban of the East, produced the conventional torse or\r\nwreath. As the conventional slashings of the lambrequin hinted at past hard\r\nfighting in battle, so did the conventional torse hint at past service to\r\nand favour of ladies, love and war being the occupations of the perfect\r\nknight of romance. How far short of the ideal knight of {404} romance the\r\nknight of fact fell, perhaps the frequent bordures and batons of heraldry\r\nare the best indication. At first, as is evident from the Garter plates,\r\nthe colours of the torse seem to have had little or no compulsory relation\r\nto the \"livery colours\" of the arms. The instances to be gleaned from the\r\nPlantagenet Garter plates which have been reproduced are as follows:--\r\n\r\nSir John Bourchier, Lord Bourchier. Torse: sable and vert. Arms: argent and\r\ngules.\r\n\r\nSir John Grey, Earl of Tankerville. Torse: vert, gules, and argent. Arms:\r\ngules and argent.\r\n\r\nSir Lewis Robsart, Lord Bourchier. Torse: azure, or, and sable. Arms: vert\r\nand or. [The crest, derived from his wife (who was a daughter of Lord\r\nBourchier) is practically the same as the one first quoted. It will be\r\nnoticed that the torse differs.]\r\n\r\nSir Edward Cherleton, Lord Cherleton of Powis. Torse: gules and sable.\r\nArms: or and gules.\r\n\r\nSir Gaston de Foix, Count de Longueville. Torse: or and gules. Arms: or and\r\ngules.\r\n\r\nSir William Nevill, Lord Fauconberg. Torse: argent and gules. Arms: gules\r\nand argent.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Wydville, Lord Rivers. Torse: vert. Arms: argent and gules.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Bourchier, Earl of Essex. Torse: sable and vert. Arms: argent and\r\ngules. [This is the same crest above alluded to.]\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Stanley, Lord Stanley. Torse: or and azure. Arms: or and azure.\r\n\r\nSir John Bourchier, Lord Berners. Torse: gules and argent. Arms: argent and\r\ngules. [This is the same crest above alluded to.]\r\n\r\nSir Walter Devereux, Lord Ferrers. Torse: argent and sable. Arms: argent\r\nand gules. [The crest really issues from a coronet upon a torse in a\r\nprevious case, this crest issues from a torse only.]\r\n\r\nSir Francis Lovel, Viscount Lovel. Torse: azure and or. Arms: or and gules.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Burgh, Lord Burgh. Torse: azure and sable. Arms: azure and\r\nermine.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Tunstall, K.G. Torse: argent and sable. Arms: sable and argent.\r\n\r\nI can suggest no explanation of these differences unless it be, which is\r\nnot unlikely, that they perpetuate \"favours\" worn; or perhaps a more likely\r\nsupposition is that the wreath or torse was of the \"family colours,\" as\r\nthese were actually worn by the servants or retainers of each person. If\r\nthis be not the case, why are the colours of the wreath termed the livery\r\ncolours? At the present time in an English or Irish {405} grant of arms the\r\ncolours are not specified, but the crest is stated to be \"on a wreath of\r\nthe colours.\" In Scotland, however, the crest is granted in the following\r\nwords: \"and upon a wreath of his liveries is set for crest.\" Consequently,\r\nI have very little doubt, the true state of the case is that originally the\r\nwreath was depicted of the colours of the livery which was worn. Then new\r\nfamilies came into prominence and eminence, and had no liveries to inherit.\r\nThey were granted arms and chose the tinctures of their arms as their\r\n\"colours,\" and used these colours for their personal liveries. The natural\r\nconsequence would be in such a case that the torse, being in unison with\r\nthe livery, was also in unison with the arms. The consequence is that it\r\nhas become a fixed, unalterable rule in British heraldry that the torse\r\nshall be of the principal metal and of the principal colour of the arms. I\r\nknow of no recent exception to this rule, the latest, as far as I am aware,\r\nbeing a grant in the early years of the eighteenth century. This, it is\r\nstated in the patent, was the regranting of a coat of foreign origin.\r\nDoubtless the formality of a grant was substituted for the usual\r\nregistration in this case, owing to a lack of formal proof of a right to\r\nthe arms, but there is no doubt that the peculiarities of the foreign arms,\r\nas they had been previously borne, were preserved in the grant. The\r\npeculiarity in this case consisted of a torse of three tinctures. The late\r\nLyon Clerk once pointed out to me, in Lyon Register, an instance of a coat\r\nthere matriculated with a torse of three colours, but I unfortunately made\r\nno note of it at the time. Woodward alludes to the curious chequy wreath on\r\nthe seals of Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, in 1389. This appears to have\r\nbeen repeated in the seals of his son Murdoch.\r\n\r\nThe wreath of Patrick Hepburn appears to be of roses in the Gelre\r\n\"Armorial,\" and a careful examination of the plates in this volume will\r\nshow many curious Continental instances of substitutes for the conventional\r\ntorse. Though by no means peculiar to British heraldry, there can be no\r\nmanner of doubt that the wreath in the United Kingdom has obtained a\r\nposition of legalised necessity and constant usage and importance which\r\nexists in no other country.\r\n\r\nAs has been already explained, the torse should fit closely to the crest,\r\nits object and purpose being merely to hide the joining of crest and\r\nhelmet. Unfortunately in British heraldry this purpose has been ignored.\r\nDoubtless resulting first from the common practice of depicting a crest\r\nupon a wreath and without a helmet, and secondly from the fact that many\r\nEnglish crests are quite unsuitable to place on a helmet, in fact\r\nimpossible to affix by the aid of a wreath to a helmet, and thirdly from\r\nour ridiculous rules of position for a helmet, which result in the crest\r\nbeing depicted (in conjunction with the {406} representation of the helmet)\r\nin a position many such crests never could have occupied on any helmet, the\r\neffect has been to cause the wreath to lose its real form, which encircled\r\nthe _helmet_, and to become considered as no more than a straight support\r\nfor and relating only to the crest. When, therefore, the crest and its\r\nsupporting basis is transferred from indefinite space to the helmet, the\r\nsupport, which is the torse, is still represented as a flat resting-place\r\nfor the crest, and it is consequently depicted as a straight and rigid bar,\r\nbalanced upon the apex of the helmet. This is now and for long has been the\r\nonly accepted official way of depicting a wreath in England. Certainly this\r\nis an ungraceful and inartistic rendering, and a rendering far removed from\r\nany actual helmet wreath that can ever have been actually borne. Whilst one\r\nhas no wish to defend the \"rigid bar,\" which has nothing to recommend it,\r\nit is at the same time worth while to point out that the heraldic day of\r\nactual helmets and actual usage is long since over, never to be revived,\r\nand that our heraldry of to-day is merely decorative and pictorial. The\r\nrigid bar is none other than a conventionalised form of the actual torse,\r\nand is perhaps little more at variance with the reality than is our\r\nconventionalised method of depicting a lambrequin. Whilst this conventional\r\ntorse remains the official pattern, it is hopeless to attempt to banish\r\nsuch a method of representation: but Lyon King of Arms, happily, will have\r\nnone of it in his official register or on his patents, and few heraldic\r\nartists of any repute now care to so design or represent it. As always\r\nofficially painted it must consist of six links alternately of metal and\r\ncolour (the \"livery colours\" of the arms), of which the metal must be the\r\nfirst to be shown to the dexter side. The torse is now supposed to be and\r\nrepresented as a skein of coloured silk intertwined with a gold or silver\r\ncord. {407}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nSUPPORTERS\r\n\r\nIn this country a somewhat fictitious importance has become attached to\r\nsupporters, owing to their almost exclusive reservation to the highest\r\nrank. The rules which hold at the moment will be recited presently, but\r\nthere can be no doubt that originally they were in this country little more\r\nthan mere decorative and artistic appendages, being devised and altered\r\nfrom time to time by different artists according as the artistic\r\nnecessities of the moment demanded. The subject of the origin of supporters\r\nhas been very ably dealt with in \"A Treatise on Heraldry\" by Woodward and\r\nBurnett, and with all due acknowledgment I take from that work the\r\nsubjoined extract:--\r\n\r\n\"Supporters are figures of living creatures placed at the side or sides of\r\nan armorial shield, and appearing to support it. French writers make a\r\ndistinction, giving the name of _Supports_ to animals, real or imaginary,\r\nthus employed; while human figures or angels similarly used are called\r\n_Tenants_. Trees, and other inanimate objects which are sometimes used, are\r\ncalled _Soutiens_.\r\n\r\n\"Menêtrier and other old writers trace the origin of supporters to the\r\nusages of the tournaments, where the shields of the combatants were exposed\r\nfor inspection, and guarded by their servants or pages disguised in\r\nfanciful attire: 'C'est des Tournois qu'est venu cet usage parce que les\r\nchevaliers y faisoient porter leurs lances, et leurs écus, par des pages,\r\net des valets de pied, deguisez en ours, en lions, en mores, et en\r\nsauvages' (_Usage des Armoiries_, p. 119).\r\n\r\n\"The old romances give us evidence that this custom prevailed; but I think\r\nonly after the use of supporters had already arisen from another source.\r\n\r\n\"There is really little doubt now that Anstis was quite correct when, in\r\nhis _Aspilogia_, he attributed the origin of supporters to the invention of\r\nthe engraver, who filled up the spaces at the top and sides of the\r\ntriangular shield upon a circular seal with foliage, or with fanciful\r\nanimals. Any good collection of mediæval seals will strengthen this\r\nconviction. For instance, the two volumes of Laing's 'Scottish Seals'\r\nafford numerous examples in which the shields used in the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries were placed between two creatures {408} resembling\r\nlizards or dragons. (See the seal of ALEXANDER DE BALLIOL, 1295.--LAING,\r\nii. 74.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The seal of John, Duke of Normandy, eldest son of the King of FRANCE,\r\nbefore 1316 bears his arms (FRANCE-ANCIENT, _a bordure gules_) between two\r\nlions rampant away from the shield, and an eagle with expanded wings\r\nstanding above it. The _secretum_ of Isabelle de FLANDRES (_c._ 1308) has\r\nher shield placed between three lions, each charged with a bend (Vrée,\r\n_Gen. Com. Flanr._, Plates XLIII., XLIV., XCII.). In 1332 AYMON OF SAVOY\r\nplaces his arms (SAVOY, _with a label_) between a winged lion in chief and\r\na lion without wings at either side. Later, on the seal of AMADEUS VI., a\r\nlion's head between wings became the crest of SAVOY. In 1332 AMADEUS bears\r\nSAVOY on a lozenge between in chief two eagles, in base two lions.\r\n(CIBRARIO, Nos. 61, 64; and GUICHENON, tome i. No. 130.) In Scotland the\r\nshield of REGINALD CRAWFORD in 1292 is placed between two dogs, and\r\nsurmounted by a fox; in the same year the paly shield of REGINALD, Earl of\r\nATHOLE, appears between two lions in chief and as many griffins in\r\nflanks.--LAING, i. 210, 761.\r\n\r\n\"The seal of HUMBERT II., Dauphin de Viennois in 1349, is an excellent\r\nexample of the fashion. The shield of DAUPHINY is in the centre of a\r\nquatrefoil. Two savages mounted on griffins support its flanks; on the\r\nupper edge an armed knight sits on a couchant lion, and the space in base\r\nis filled by a human face between two wingless dragons. The spaces are\r\nsometimes filled with the Evangelistic symbols, as on the seal of YOLANTE\r\nDE FLANDRES, Countess of Bar (_c._ 1340). The seal of JEANNE, Dame de\r\nPLASNES, in 1376 bears her arms _en bannière_ a quatrefoil supported by two\r\nkneeling angels, a demi-angel in chief, and a lion couchant guardant in\r\nbase.\"\r\n\r\nCorporate and other seals afford countless examples of the interstices in\r\nthe design being filled with the figures similar to those from which in\r\nlater days the supporters of a family have been deduced. But I am myself\r\nconvinced that the argument can be carried further. Fanciful ornamentation\r\nor meaningless devices may have first been made use of by seal engravers,\r\nbut it is very soon found that the badge is in regular use for this\r\npurpose, and we find both animate and inanimate badges employed. Then where\r\nthis is possible the badge, if animate, is made to support the helmet and\r\ncrest, and, later on, the shield, and there can be no doubt the badge was\r\nin fact acting as a supporter long before the science of armory recognised\r\nthat existence of supporters.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to supporters proper, it may be well to briefly allude to\r\nvarious figures which are to be found in a position analogous to that of\r\nsupporters. The single human figure entire, or in the form {409} of a\r\ndemi-figure appearing above the shield, is very frequently to be met with,\r\nbut the addition of such figures _was and remains purely artistic_, and I\r\nknow of no single instance in British armory where one figure, animate or\r\ninanimate, has ever existed alone in the character of a single supporter,\r\nand as an integral part of the heritable armorial achievement. Of course I\r\nexcept those figures upon which the arms of certain families are properly\r\ndisplayed. These will be presently alluded to, but though they are\r\ncertainly exterior ornaments, I do not think they can be properly classed\r\nas supporters unless to this term is given some elasticity, or unless the\r\nterm has some qualifying remarks of reservation added to it. There are,\r\nhowever, many instances of armorial ensigns depicted, and presumably\r\ncorrectly, in the form of banners supported by a single animal, but it will\r\nalways be found that the single animal is but one of the pair of duly\r\nallocated supporters. Many instances of arms depicted in this manner will\r\nbe found in \"Prince Arthur's Book.\" The same method of display was adopted\r\nin some number of cases, and with some measure of success, in Foster's\r\n\"Peerage.\" Single figures are very frequently to be met with in German and\r\nContinental heraldry, but on these occasions, as with ourselves, the\r\nposition they occupy is merely that of an artistic accessory, and bears no\r\ninseparable relation to the heraldic achievement. The single exception to\r\nthe foregoing statement of which I am aware is to be found in the arms of\r\nthe Swiss Cantons. These thirteen coats are sometimes quartered upon one\r\nshield, but when displayed separately each is accompanied by a single\r\nsupporter. Zurich, Lucerne, Uri, Unter-Walden, Glarus, and Basle all bear\r\nthe supporter on the dexter side; Bern, Schweig, Zug, Freiburg, and\r\nSoluthurn on the sinister. Schafhausen (a ram) and Appenzell (a bear) place\r\ntheir supporters in full aspect behind the shield.\r\n\r\nOn the corbels of Gothic architecture, shields of arms are frequently\r\nsupported by _Angels_, which, however, cannot generally be regarded as\r\nheraldic appendages--being merely supposed to indicate that the owners have\r\ncontributed to the erection of the fabric. Examples of this practice will\r\nbe found on various ecclesiastical edifices in Scotland, and among others\r\nat Melrose Abbey, St. Giles', Edinburgh, and the church of Seton in East\r\nLothian. An interesting instance of an angel supporting a shield occurs on\r\nthe beautiful seal of Mary of Gueldres, Queen of James II. (1459); and the\r\nPrivy Seal of David II., a hundred years earlier, exhibits a pretty design\r\nof an escutcheon charged with the ensigns of Scotland, and borne by two\r\narms issuing from clouds above, indicative of Divine support.[24] {410}\r\n\r\nOf instances of single objects from which shields are found depending or\r\nsupported the \"Treatise on Heraldry\" states:--\r\n\r\n\"Allusion has been made to the usage by which on vesica-shaped shields\r\nladies of high rank are represented as supporting with either hand shields\r\nof arms. From this probably arose the use of a single supporter. MARGUERITE\r\nDE COURCELLES in 1284, and ALIX DE VERDUN in 1311, bear in one hand a\r\nshield of the husband's arms, in the other one of their own. The curious\r\nseal of MURIEL, Countess of STRATHERNE, in 1284, may be considered akin to\r\nthese. In it the shield is supported partly by a falcon, and partly by a\r\nhuman arm issuing from the sinister side of the _vesica_, and holding the\r\nfalcon by the jesses (LAING, i. 764). The early seal of BOLESLAS III., King\r\nof POLAND, in 1255, bears a knight holding a shield charged with the Polish\r\neagle (VOSSBERG, _Die Siegel des Mittelalters_). In 1283 the seal of\r\nFLORENT of HAINAULT bears a warrior in chain mail supporting a shield\r\ncharged with a lion impaling an eagle dimidiated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"On the seal of HUMPHREY DE BOHUN in 1322 the _guige_ is held by a swan,\r\nthe badge of the Earls of HEREFORD; and in 1356 the shield of the first\r\nEarl of DOUGLAS is supported by a lion whose head is covered by the crested\r\nhelm, a fashion of which there are many examples. A helmed lion holds the\r\nshield of MAGNUS I., Duke of BRUNSWICK, in 1326.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"On the seal of JEAN, Duc de BERRI, in 1393 the supporter is a helmed swan\r\n(compare the armorial slab of HENRY of LANCASTER, in BOUTELL, Plate\r\nLXXIX.). Jean IV., Comte d'ALENÇON (1408), has a helmed lion sejant as\r\nsupporter. In 1359 a signet of LOUIS VAN MALE, Count of FLANDERS, bears a\r\nlion sejant, helmed and crested, and mantled with the arms of FLANDERS\r\nbetween two small escutcheons of NEVERS, or the county of Burgundy [\"Azure,\r\nbilletty, a lion rampant or\"], and RETHEL [\"Gules, two heads of rakes\r\nfesswise in pale or\"].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A single lion sejant, helmed and crested, bearing on its breast the\r\nquartered arms of BURGUNDY between two or three other escutcheons, was used\r\nby the Dukes up to the death of CHARLES THE BOLD in 1475. In LITTA'S\r\nsplendid work, _Famiglie celebri Italiane_, the BUONAROTTI arms are\r\nsupported by a brown dog sejant, helmed, and crested with a pair of\r\ndragon's wings issuing from a crest-coronet. On the seal of THOMAS HOLLAND,\r\nEarl of KENT, in 1380 the shield is buckled round the neck of the white\r\nhind lodged, the badge of his half-brother, RICHARD II. Single supporters\r\nwere very much in favour in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and\r\nthe examples are numerous. {411} CHARLES, Dauphin de VIENNOIS (_c._ 1355),\r\nhas his shield held by a single dolphin. In 1294 the seal of the Dauphin\r\nJEAN, son of HUMBERT I., bears the arms of DAUPHINÉ pendent from the neck\r\nof a griffon. The shields of arms of BERTRAND DE BRICQUEBEC, in 1325;\r\nPIERRE DE TOURNEBU, in 1339; of CHARLES, Count of ALENÇON, in 1356; and of\r\nOLIVER DE CLISSON in 1397, are supported by a warrior who stands behind the\r\nshield. In England the seal of HENRY PERCY, first Earl, in 1346, and\r\nanother in 1345, have similar representations.\r\n\r\n\"On several of our more ancient seals only one supporter is represented,\r\nand probably the earliest example of this arrangement occurs on the curious\r\nseal of William, first Earl of Douglas (_c._ 1356), where the shield is\r\nsupported from behind by a lion 'sejant,' _with his head in the helmet_,\r\nwhich is surmounted by the crest.\r\n\r\n\"On the seal of Archibald, fourth Earl of Douglas (_c._ 1418), the shield\r\nis held, along with a club, in the right hand of a savage _erect_, who\r\nbears a helmet in his left; while on that of William, eighth Earl (1446), a\r\n_kneeling_ savage holds a club in his right hand, and supports a couché\r\nshield on his left arm.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 666.--Arms of Sigmund Hagelshaimer.]\r\n\r\nAn example reproduced from Jost Amman's _Wappen und Stammbuch_, published\r\nat Frankfurt, 1589, will be found in Fig. 666. In this the figure partakes\r\nmore of the character of a shield guardian than a shield supporter. The\r\narms are those of \"Sigmund Hagelshaimer,\" otherwise \"Helt,\" living at\r\nNürnberg. The arms are \"Sable, on a bend argent, an arrow gules.\" The crest\r\nis the head and neck of a hound sable, continued into a mantling sable,\r\nlined argent. The crest is charged with a pale argent, and thereupon an\r\narrow as in the arms, the arrow-head piercing the ear of the hound.\r\n\r\nSeated figures as supporters are rare, but one occurs in Fig. 667, which\r\nshows the arms of the Vöhlin family. They bear: \"Argent, on a fesse sable,\r\nthree 'P's' argent.\" The wings which form the crest are charged with the\r\nsame device. This curious charge of the three letters is explained in the\r\nfollowing saying:--\r\n\r\n \"Piper Peperit Pecuniam,\r\n  Pecunia Peperit Pompam,\r\n  Pompa Peperit Pauperiem,\r\n  Pauperies Peperit Pietatem.\"\r\n\r\n{412}\r\n\r\nThere are, however, certain exceptions to the British rule that there can\r\nbe no single supporters, if the objects upon which shields of arms are\r\ndisplayed are accepted as supporters. It was always customary to display\r\nthe arms of the Lord High Admiral on the sail of the ship. In the person of\r\nKing William IV., before he succeeded to the throne, the office of Lord\r\nHigh Admiral was vested for a short time, but it had really fallen into\r\ndesuetude at an earlier date and has not been revived again, so that to all\r\nintents and purposes it is now extinct, and this recognised method of\r\ndepicting arms is consequently also extinct. But there is one other case\r\nwhich forms a unique instance which can be classified with no others. The\r\narms of Campbell of Craignish are always represented in a curious manner,\r\nthe gyronny coat of Campbell appearing on a shield displayed in front of a\r\nlymphad (Plate II.). What the origin of this practice is it would be\r\ndifficult to say; probably it merely originated in the imaginative ideas of\r\nan artist when making a seal for that family, artistic reasons suggesting\r\nthe display of the gyronny arms of Campbell in front of the lymphad of\r\nLorne. The family, however, seem to have universally adopted this method of\r\nusing their arms, and in the year 1875, when Campbell of Inverneil\r\nmatriculated in Lyon Register, the arms were matriculated in that form. I\r\nknow of no other instance of any such coat of arms, and this branch of the\r\nDucal House of Campbell possesses armorial bearings which, from the\r\nofficial standpoint, are absolutely unique from one end of Europe to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the use of arms depicted in front of the eagle displayed, either\r\nsingle-headed or double-headed, is very far from being unusual. Whatever\r\nmay have been its meaning originally in that country, there is no doubt\r\nthat now and for some centuries past it has been accepted as meaning, or as\r\nindicative of, princely rank or other honours of the Holy Roman Empire. But\r\nI do not think it can always have had that meaning. About the same date the\r\nEarl of Menteith placed his shield on the breast of an eagle, as did\r\nAlexander, Earl of Ross, in 1338; and in 1394 we find the same\r\nornamentation in the seal of Euphemia, Countess of Ross. The shield of Ross\r\nis borne in her case on the breast of an eagle, while the arms of Leslie\r\nand Comyn appear on its displayed wings. On several other Scottish seals of\r\nthe same era, the shield is placed on the breast of a displayed eagle, as\r\non those of Alexander Abernethy and Alexander Cumin of Buchan (1292), and\r\nSir David Lindsay, Lord of Crawford. English heraldry supplies several\r\nsimilar examples, of which we may mention the armorial insignia of Richard,\r\nEarl of Cornwall, brother of Henry III., and of the ancient family of\r\nLatham, in the fourteenth century. A curious instance of a shield placed on\r\nthe breast of a _hawk_ is noticed by Hone in his \"Table {413} Book,\" viz.\r\nthe arms of the Lord of the Manor of Stoke-Lyne, in the county of Oxford.\r\nIt appears therefrom that when Charles I. held his Parliament at Oxford,\r\nthe offer of knighthood was gratefully declined by the then Lord of\r\nStoke-Lyne, who merely requested, and obtained, the Royal permission to\r\nplace the arms of his family upon the breast of a hawk, which has ever\r\nsince been employed in the capacity of single supporter. What authority\r\nexists for this statement it is impossible to ascertain, and one must doubt\r\nits accuracy, because in England at any rate no arms, allocated to any\r\nparticular _territorial estate_, have ever received official recognition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 667.--Arms of Vöhlin of Augsberg.]\r\n\r\nIn later years, as indicative of rank in the Holy Roman Empire, the eagle\r\nhas been rightly borne by the first Duke of Marlborough and by Henrietta\r\nhis daughter, Duchess of Marlborough, but the use of the eagle by the later\r\nDukes of Marlborough would appear to be entirely without authority,\r\ninasmuch as the princedom, created in the person of the first duke, became\r\nextinct on his death. His daughters, though entitled of right to the\r\ncourtesy rank of princess and its accompanying privilege of the right to\r\nuse the eagle displayed behind their arms, could not transmit it to their\r\ndescendants upon whom the title of Duke of Marlborough was specially\r\nentailed by English Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Denbigh and several members of the Fielding family have often\r\nmade use of it with their arms, in token of their supposed descent from the\r\nCounts of Hapsburg, which, if correct, would apparently confer the right\r\nupon them. This descent, however, has been much questioned, and in late\r\nyears the claim thereto would seem to have been practically dropped. The\r\nlate Earl Cowper, the last remaining Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in the\r\nBritish Peerage, was entitled to use the double eagle behind his shield,\r\nbeing the descendant and representative of George Nassau Clavering Cowper,\r\nthird Earl Cowper, created a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire by the Emperor\r\nJoseph II., the patent being dated at Vienna, 31st January 1778, and this\r\nbeing followed by a Royal Licence from King George III. to accept and bear\r\nthe title in this country.\r\n\r\nThere are some others who have the right by reason of honours of lesser\r\nrank of the Holy Roman Empire, and amongst these may be mentioned Lord\r\nMethuen, who bears the eagle by Royal Warrant dated 4th April 1775. Sir\r\nThomas Arundel, who served in the Imperial army of Hungary, having in an\r\nengagement with the Turks near Strignum taken their standard with his own\r\nhands, was by Rodolph II. created Count of the Empire to hold for him and\r\nthe heirs of his body for ever, dated at Prague 14th December 1595. This\r\npatent, of course, means that every one of his descendants in the male\r\n{414} line has the rank of a Count of the Empire, and that every daughter\r\nof any such male descendant is a Countess, but this does not confer the\r\nrank of count or countess upon descendants of the daughters. It was this\r\nparticular patent of creation that called forth the remark from Queen\r\nElizabeth that she would not have her sheep branded by any foreign\r\nshepherd, and we believe that this patent was the origin of the rule\r\ntranslated in later times (_temp._ George IV.) into a definite Royal\r\nWarrant, requiring that no English subject shall, without the express Royal\r\nLicence of the Sovereign conveyed in writing, accept or wear any foreign\r\ntitle or decoration. No Royal Licence was subsequently obtained by the\r\nArundel family, who therefore, according to British law, are denied the use\r\nof the privileged Imperial eagle. Outside those cases in which the double\r\neagle is used in this country to denote rank of the Holy Roman Empire, the\r\nusage of the eagle displayed behind the arms or any analogous figure is in\r\nBritish heraldry most limited.\r\n\r\nOne solitary authoritative instance of the use of the displayed eagle is\r\nfound in the coat of arms of the city of Perth. These arms are recorded in\r\nLyon Register, having been matriculated for that Royal Burgh about the year\r\n1672. The official blazon of the arms is as follows: \"Gules ane holy lambe\r\npassant regardant staff and cross argent, with the banner of St. Andrew\r\nproper, all within a double tressure counter-flowered of the second, the\r\nescutcheon being surmounted on the breast of ane eagle with two necks\r\ndisplayed or. The motto in ane Escroll, 'Pro Rege Lege et Grege.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother instance of usage, though purely devoid of authority, occurs in the\r\ncase of a coat of arms set up on one of the panels in the Hall of Lincoln's\r\nInn. In this case the achievement is displayed on the breast of a\r\nsingle-headed eagle. What reason led to its usage in this manner I am quite\r\nunaware, and I have not the slightest reason for supposing it to be\r\nauthentic. The family of Stuart-Menteith also place their arms upon a\r\nsingle-headed eagle displayed gules, as was formerly to be seen in\r\nDebrett's Peerage, but though arms are matriculated to them in Lyon\r\nRegister, this particular adornment forms no part thereof, and it has now\r\ndisappeared from the printed Peerage books. The family of Britton have,\r\nhowever, recently recorded as a badge a double-headed eagle displayed\r\nermine, holding in its claws an escutcheon of their arms (Plate VIII.).\r\n\r\nOccasionally batons or wands or other insignia of office are to be found in\r\nconjunction with armorial bearings, but these will be more fully dealt with\r\nunder the heading of Insignia of Office. Before dealing with the usual\r\nsupporters, one perhaps may briefly allude to \"inanimate\" supporters. {415}\r\n\r\nProbably the most curious instance of all will be found in the achievement\r\nof the Earls of Errol as it appears in the MS. of Sir David Lindsay. In\r\nthis two ox-yokes take the place of the supporters. The curious tradition\r\nwhich has been attached to the Hay arms is quoted as follows by Sir James\r\nBalfour Paul, Lyon King of Arms, in his \"Heraldry in relation to Scottish\r\nHistory and Art,\" who writes: \"Take the case of the well-known coat of the\r\nHays, and hear the description of its origin as given by Nisbet: 'In the\r\nreign of Kenneth III., about the year 980, when the Danes invaded Scotland,\r\nand prevailing in the battle of Luncarty, a country Scotsman with his two\r\nsons, of great strength and courage, having rural weapons, as the yokes of\r\ntheir plough, and such plough furniture, stopped the Scots in their flight\r\nin a certain defile, and upbraiding them with cowardice, obliged them to\r\nrally, who with them renewed the battle, and gave a total overthrow to the\r\nvictorious Danes; and it is said by some, after the victory was obtained,\r\nthe old man lying on the ground, wounded and fatigued, cried, \"Hay, Hay,\"\r\nwhich word became a surname to his posterity. He and his sons being\r\nnobilitate, the King gave him the aforesaid arms (argent, three escutcheons\r\ngules) to intimate that the father and the two sons had been luckily the\r\nthree shields of Scotland, and gave them as much land in the Carse of\r\nGowrie as a falcon did fly over without lighting, which having flown a\r\ngreat way, she lighted on a stone there called the Falcon Stone to this\r\nday. The circumstances of which story is not only perpetuated by the three\r\nescutcheons, but by the exterior ornaments of the achievement of the family\r\nof Errol; having for crest, on a wreath, a falcon proper; for supporters\r\ntwo men in country habits, holding the oxen-yokes of a plough over their\r\nshoulders; and for motto, \"Serva jugum.\"'\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately for the truth of this picturesque tale there are several\r\nreasons which render it utterly incredible, not the least being that at the\r\nperiod of the supposed battle armorial bearings were quite unknown, and\r\ncould not have formed the subject of a royal gift. Hill Burton, indeed,\r\nstrongly doubts the occurrence of the battle itself, and says that Hector\r\nBoece, who relates the occurrence, must be under strong suspicion of having\r\nentirely invented it. As for the origin of the name itself, it is, as Mr.\r\nCosmo Innes points out in his work on 'Scottish Surnames,' derived from a\r\nplace in Normandy, and neither it nor any other surname occurred in\r\nScotland till long after the battle of Luncarty. I have mentioned this\r\nstory in some detail, as it is a very typical specimen of its class; but\r\nthere are others like unto it, often traceable to the same incorrigible old\r\nliar, Hector Boece.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that the ox-yoke was a badge of the Hays, Earls of\r\nErrol, and a reference to the variations of the original arms, crest, {416}\r\nand supporters of Hay will show how the changes have been rung on the\r\nshields, falcon, ox-yokes, and countrymen of the legend.\r\n\r\nAnother instance is to be found in the arms of the Mowbray family as they\r\nwere at one time depicted with an ostrich feather on either side of the\r\nshield (Fig. 675, p. 465), and at first one might be inclined to class\r\nthese amongst the inanimate supporters. The Garter plate, however, of John\r\nBeaufort, Duke of Somerset, probably supplies the key to the whole matter,\r\nfor this shows not only the ostrich feathers but also supporters of the\r\nordinary character in their usual position. From the last-mentioned\r\ninstance, it is evident the ostrich feathers can be only representations of\r\nthe badge, their character doubtless being peculiarly adaptable to the\r\ncurious position they occupy. They are of course the same in the case of\r\nthe Mowbray arms, and doubtless the ox-yoke of the Earl of Errol is\r\nsimilarly no more than a badge.\r\n\r\nA most curious instance of supporters is to be found in the case of the\r\narms of Viscount Montgomery. This occurs in a record of them in Ulster's\r\nOffice, where the arms appear without the usual kind of supporters, but\r\nrepresented with an arm in armour, on either side issuing from clouds in\r\nbase, the hands supporting the shield.\r\n\r\nWhen supporters are inanimate objects, the escutcheon is said to be\r\ncottised--a term derived from the French word _côté_ (a side)--in\r\ncontradistinction to supported. An old Scottish term for supporters was\r\n\"bearers.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst other cases where the shield is cottised by inanimate objects may\r\nbe mentioned the following. The Breton family of \"Bastard\" depict their\r\nshield cottised by two swords, with the points in base. The Marquises\r\nAlberti similarly use two lighted flambeaux, and the Dalzells (of Binns)\r\nthe extraordinary device of a pair of tent-poles. Whether this last has\r\nbeen officially sanctioned I am unaware. The \"Pillars of Hercules\" used by\r\nCharles V. are, perhaps, the best known of this group of supporters. In\r\nmany cases (notably foreign) the supporters appear to have gradually\r\nreceded to the back of the shield, as in the case of the Comte d'Erps,\r\nChancellor of Brabant, where two maces (or) are represented saltirewise\r\n_behind_ the shield. Generally, however, this variation is found in\r\nconjunction with purely official or corporate achievements.\r\n\r\nA curious example of inanimate supporters occurs on the English seal of\r\nWilliam, Lord Botreaux (1426), where, on each side of a couché shield\r\nexhibiting a griffin \"segreant\" and surmounted by a helmet and crest, a\r\nbuttress is quaintly introduced, in evident allusion to the owner's name. A\r\nsomewhat similar arrangement appears on the Scottish seal of William\r\nRuthven (1396), where a tree growing from a mount is placed on each side of\r\nthe escutcheon. Another instance is to be {417} found in the seal of John\r\nde Segrave, where a garb is placed on either side of the shield. Perhaps\r\nmention should here be made of the arms (granted in 1826) of the National\r\nBank of Scotland, the shield of which is \"surrounded with two thistles\r\nproper disposed in orle.\"\r\n\r\nHeraldic supporters as such, or badges occupying the position and answering\r\nthe purpose of supporters, and not merely as artistic accessories, in\r\nEngland date from the early part of the fourteenth century. Very restricted\r\nin use at first, they later rapidly became popular, and there were few\r\npeers who did not display them upon their seals. For some reason, however,\r\nvery few indeed appear on the early Garter plates. It is a striking fact\r\nthat by far the larger number of the ancient standards display as the chief\r\ndevice not the arms but one of the supporters, and I am inclined to think\r\nthat in this fact we have further confirmation of my belief that the origin\r\nof supporters is found in the badge.\r\n\r\nEven after the use of two supporters had become general, a third figure is\r\noften found placed behind the shield, and forms a connecting link with the\r\nold practice of filling the void spaces on seals, to which we have already\r\nreferred. On the seal of WILLIAM STERLING, in 1292, two lions rampant\r\nsupport the shield in front of a tree. The shield on the seal of OLIVER\r\nROUILLON, in 1376, is supported by an angel, and by two demi-lions\r\ncouchant-guardant in base. That of PIERRE AVOIR, in 1378, is held by a\r\ndemi-eagle above the shield, and by two mermaids. On many ancient seals the\r\nsupporters are disposed so that they hold the crested helm above a couché\r\nshield.\r\n\r\nThe counter-seals of RUDOLF IV., Archduke of AUSTRIA, in 1359 and 1362,\r\nafford instances in which a second set of supporters is used to hold up the\r\ncrested helm. The shield of AUSTRIA is supported by two lions, on whose\r\nvolets are the arms of HAPSBURG and PFIRT; the crested helm (coroneted, and\r\nhaving a panache of ostrich feathers) is also held by two lions, whose\r\nvolets are charged with the arms of STIRIA, and of CARINTHIA (HUEBER,\r\n_Austria Illustrata,_ tab. xviii.).\r\n\r\nIn 1372 the seal of EDMUND MORTIMER represents his shield hanging from a\r\nrose-tree, and supported by two lions couchant (of MARCH), whose heads are\r\ncovered by coroneted helmets with a panache (azure) as crest.\r\n\r\nBOUTELL directs attention to the fact that the shield of EDMUND DE ARUNDEL\r\n(1301-1326) is placed between similar helms and panaches, without the\r\nsupporting beasts (\"Heraldry: Historical and Popular,\" pp. 271-418).\r\n\r\nCrested supporters have sometimes been misunderstood, and quoted as\r\ninstances of double supporters--for instance, by LOWER, \"Curiosities of\r\nHeraldry,\" who gives (p. 144) a cut from the {418} achievement of the\r\nFrench D'ALBRETS as \"the most singular supporters, perhaps, in the whole\r\ncircle of heraldry.\" These supporters are two lions couchant (or), each\r\nhelmed, and crested with an eagle au vol leve. These eagles certainly\r\nassist in holding the shield, but the lions are its true supporters; nor is\r\nthis arrangement by any means unique. The swans which were used as\r\nsupporters by JEAN, DUC DE BERRI, in 1386, are each mounted upon a bear.\r\nTwo wild men, each _à cheval_ on a lion, support the escutcheons of GERARD\r\nD'HARCHIES (1476) and of NICOLE DE GIRESME (1464). Two lions sejant, helmed\r\nand crested (the crest is a human head with the ears of an ass) were the\r\nsupporters of ARNAUD D'ALBREY in 1368.\r\n\r\nScotland, which is the home of curiosities of heraldry, gives us at least\r\ntwo instances of the use of supporters which must be absolutely\r\nunique--that is, the surcharging of an escutcheon with an inescutcheon, to\r\nthe latter of which supporters are attached. The first instance occurs in\r\nthe cases of Baronets of Nova Scotia, a clause appearing in all the earlier\r\npatents which ordained \"that the Baronets, and their heirs-male, should, as\r\nan _additament of honour_ to their armorial ensigns, bear, either on a\r\ncanton or inescutcheon, in their option, the ensign of Nova Scotia, being\r\n_argent_, a cross of St. Andrew _azure_ (the badge of Scotland\r\ncounterchanged), charged with an inescutcheon of the Royal Arms of\r\nScotland, supported on the dexter by the Royal unicorn, and on the sinister\r\nby a savage, or wild man, proper; and for crest, a branch of laurel and a\r\nthistle issuing from two hands conjoined, the one being armed, the other\r\nnaked; with the motto, \"Munit hæc et altera vincit.\" The incongruity of\r\nthese exterior ornaments within a shield of arms is noticed by Nisbet, who\r\ninforms us, however, that they are very soon removed. In the year 1629,\r\nafter Nova Scotia was sold to the French, the Baronets of Scotland, and\r\ntheir heirs-male, were authorised by Charles I. \"to wear and carry about\r\ntheir necks, in all time coming, an orange-tawny silk ribbon, whereon shall\r\nbe pendent, in a scutcheon _argent_, a saltire _azure_, thereon an\r\ninescutcheon, of the arms of Scotland, with an Imperial crown above the\r\nscutcheon and encircled with this motto: 'Fax mentis honestæ gloria.'\"\r\nAccording to the same authority, this badge was never much used \"about\r\ntheir necks,\" but was carried, by way of canton or inescutcheon, on their\r\narmorial bearings, without the motto, and, of course, since then the\r\nsuperimposed supporters have been dropped.\r\n\r\nThe same peculiarity of supporters being surcharged upon a shield will be\r\nfound, however, in the matriculation (1795) to Cumming-Gordon of Altyre.\r\nThese arms are depicted on Plate III. In this the entire achievement (arms,\r\ncrest, motto, and supporters) of Gordon of Gordon {419} is placed upon an\r\ninescutcheon superimposed over the arms of Cumming.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the arms, and the arms only, constitute the mark of a given\r\nfamily, and whilst due difference is made in the respective shields, no\r\nattempt is made as regards crest or supporters to impose any distinction\r\nbetween the figures granted to different families even where no blood\r\nrelationship exists. The result is that whilst the same crests and\r\nsupporters are duplicated over and over again, they at any rate remain in\r\nScotland simple, graceful, and truly heraldic, even when judged by the most\r\nrigid mediæval standard. They are, of course, necessarily of no value\r\nwhatever for identification. In England the simplicity is relinquished for\r\nthe sake of distinction, and it is held that equivalent differentiation\r\nmust be made, both in regard to the crests and the supporters, as is made\r\nbetween the shields of different families. The result as to modern crests\r\nis truly appalling, and with supporters it is almost equally so, for by\r\ntheir very nature it is impossible to design adequate differences for\r\ncrests and supporters, as can readily be done in the charges upon a shield,\r\nwithout creating monstrosities. With regret one has to admit that the\r\ndangling shields, the diapered chintz-like bodies, and the fasces and other\r\nfootstools so frequently provided for modern supporters in England would\r\nseem to be pedantic, unnecessary, and inartistic strivings after a useless\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nIn England the right to bear supporters is confined to those to whom they\r\nhave been granted or recorded, but such grant or record is very rigidly\r\nconfined to peers, to Knights of the Garter, Thistle, and St. Patrick, and\r\nto Knights Grand Cross, or Knights Grand Commanders (as the case may be) of\r\nother Orders. Before the Order of the Bath was divided into classes,\r\nKnights of the Bath had supporters. As by an unwritten but nowadays\r\ninvariably accepted law, the Orders of the Garter, Thistle, and St. Patrick\r\nare confined to members of the peerage, those entitled to claim (upon their\r\npetitioning) a grant of supporters in England are in practice limited to\r\npeers and Knights Grand Cross or Knights Grand Commanders. In the cases of\r\npeers, the grant is always attached to a particular peerage, the\r\n\"remainder\" in the limitations of the grant being to \"those of his\r\ndescendants upon whom the peerage may devolve,\" or some other words to this\r\neffect. In the cases of life peers and Knights Grand Cross the grant has no\r\nhereditary limitation, and the right to the supporters is personal to the\r\ngrantee. There is nothing to distinguish the supporters of a peer from\r\nthose of a Knight Grand Cross. Baronets of England, Ireland, Great Britain,\r\nand the United Kingdom as such are not entitled to claim grants of\r\nsupporters, but there are some number of cases in which, by special favour\r\nof the sovereign, specific Royal Warrants have been {420} issued-either as\r\nmarks of favour or as augmentations of honour--conveying the pleasure of\r\nthe sovereign to the kings of arms, and directing the latter to grant\r\nsupporters--to descend with the baronetcy. Of the cases of this nature the\r\nfollowing may be quoted: Guise (Royal Warrant, dated July 12, 1863),\r\nPrevost (Royal Warrant, October 1816), Guinness, now Lord Ardilaun (Royal\r\nWarrant, dated April 15, 1867), Halford (Royal Warrant, May 19, 1827),\r\nOtway (Royal Warrant, June 10, 1845), and Laking. These, of course, are\r\nexceptional marks of favour from the sovereign, and this favour in at least\r\ntwo instances has been extended to untitled families. In 1815 Mr. George\r\nWatson-Taylor, an especial intimate of the then Prince Regent, by Royal\r\nWarrant dated September 28, 1815, was granted the following supporters: \"On\r\neither side a leopard proper, armed and langued gules, collared and chained\r\nor.\" A more recent instance, and, with the exception of an Irish case\r\npresently to be referred to, the only other one within the knowledge of the\r\nwriter, is the case of the Speke[25] arms. It is recited in the Royal\r\nWarrant, dated July 26, 1867, that Captain John Hanning Speke \"was by a\r\ndeplorable accident suddenly deprived of his life before he had received\r\nany mark of our Royal favour\" in connection with the discovery of the\r\nsources of the Nile. The Warrant goes on to recite the grant to his father,\r\nWilliam Speke, of Jordans, co. Somerset, of the following augmentations to\r\nhis original arms (argent, two bars azure) namely: on a chief a\r\nrepresentation of flowing water superinscribed with the word \"Nile,\" and\r\nfor a crest of honourable augmentation a \"crocodile,\" also the supporters\r\nfollowing--that is to say, on the dexter side a crocodile, and on the\r\nsinister side a hippopotamus. Some number of English baronets have gone to\r\nthe trouble and expense of obtaining grants of supporters in Lyon Office;\r\nfor example Sir Christopher Baynes, by grant dated June 10, 1805, obtained\r\ntwo savages, wreathed about the temples and loins, each holding a club over\r\nthe exterior shoulder. It is very doubtful to what extent such grants in\r\nScotland to domiciled Englishmen can be upheld. Many other baronets have at\r\none time or another assumed supporters without any official warrant or\r\nauthority in consequence of certain action taken by an earlier committee of\r\nthe baronetage, but cases of this kind are slowly dropping out of the\r\nPeerage books, and this, {421} combined with the less ostentatious taste of\r\nthe present day in the depicting of armorial bearings upon carriages and\r\nelsewhere, is slowly but steadily reducing the use of supporters to those\r\nwho possess official authority for their display.\r\n\r\nAnother fruitful origin of the use of unauthorised supporters at the\r\npresent day lies in the fact that grants of supporters personal to the\r\ngrantee for his life only have been made to Knights Grand Cross or to life\r\npeers in cases where a hereditary title has been subsequently conferred.\r\nThe limitations of the grant of supporters having never been extended, the\r\ngrant has naturally expired with the death of the life honour to which the\r\nsupporters were attached.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these cases there is a very limited number of families which\r\nhave always claimed supporters by prescriptive right, amongst whom may be\r\nmentioned Tichborne of Tichborne (two lions guardant gules), De Hoghton of\r\nHoghton (two bulls argent), Scroope of Danby (two choughs), and Stapylton.\r\nConcerning such cases it can only be said that in England no official\r\nsanction has ever been given to such use, and no case exists of any\r\nofficial recognition of the right of an untitled family to bear supporters\r\nto their arms save those few exceptional cases governed by specific Royal\r\nWarrants. In many cases, notably Scroope, Luttrel, Hilton, and Stapylton,\r\nthe supporters have probably originated in their legitimate adoption at an\r\nearly period in connection with peerage or other titular distinction, and\r\nhave continued inadvertently in use when the titular distinctions to which\r\nthey belonged have ceased to exist or have devolved upon other families.\r\nPossibly their use in some cases has been the result of a _claim_ to _de\r\njure_ honours. The cases where supporters are claimed \"by prescriptive\r\nright\" are few indeed in England, and need not be further considered.\r\n\r\nWhilst the official laws in Ireland are, and have apparently always been,\r\nthe same as in England, there is no doubt that the heads of the different\r\nsepts assert a claim to the right to use supporters. On this point Sir\r\nBernard Burke, Ulster King of Arms, wrote: \"No registry of supporters to an\r\nIrish chieftain appears in Ulster's Office, in right of his chieftaincy\r\nonly, and without the honour of peerage, nor does any authority to bear\r\nthem exist.\" But nevertheless \"The O'Donovan\" uses, dexter, a lion\r\nguardant, and sinister, a griffin; \"The O'Gorman\" uses, dexter, a lion, and\r\nsinister, a horse; \"The O'Reilly\" uses two lions or. \"The O'Connor Don,\"\r\nhowever, is in the unique position of bearing supporters by unquestionable\r\nright, inasmuch as the late Queen Victoria, on the occasion of her last\r\nvisit to Dublin, issued her Royal Warrant conferring the right upon him.\r\nThe supporters granted to him were \"two lions rampant gules, each gorged\r\nwith an antique crown, and charged on the shoulder with an Irish harp or.\"\r\n{422}\r\n\r\nThe right to bear supporters in Scotland is on a widely different basis\r\nfrom that in any other country. As in England and Ireland, peers and\r\nKnights Grand Cross are permitted to obtain grants of these distinctions.\r\nBut outside and beyond these there are many other families who bear them by\r\nright. At the official inquiry concerning the Lyon Office, the Lyon-Depute,\r\nMr. George Tait, put in a Note of Persons whom he considered might lawfully\r\nbear supporters under Scottish Heraldic Law. The following is the text of\r\nthe note in question:--\r\n\r\n    \"NOTE OF PERSONS who are considered by GEORGE TAIT, Esq., Lyon-Depute,\r\n    to be entitled to supporters, furnished to the Commissioners of Inquiry\r\n    by their desire, intimated to him at his examination this day, June 27,\r\n    1821.\r\n\r\n    \"1. _Peers._--By immemorial usage, Peers have right to supporters, and\r\n    supporters are commonly inserted in modern patents of Peerage. This\r\n    includes Peeresses in their own right.\r\n\r\n    \"2. _Ancient Usage._--Those private gentlemen, and the lawful\r\n    heirs-male of their bodies, who can prove immemorial usage of carrying\r\n    supporters, or a usage very ancient, and long prior to the Act 1672,\r\n    are entitled to have their supporters recognised, it being presumed\r\n    that they received them from lawful authority, on account of feats of\r\n    valour in battle or in tournament, or as marks of the Royal favour (see\r\n    _Murray of Touchadam's Case_, June 24, 1778).\r\n\r\n    \"3. _Barons._--Lawful heirs-male of the bodies of the smaller Barons,\r\n    who had the full right of free barony (not mere freeholders) prior to\r\n    1587, when representation of the minor Barons was fully established,\r\n    upon the ground that those persons were Barons, and sat in Parliament\r\n    as such, and were of the same as the titled Barons. Their right is\r\n    recognised by the writers on heraldry and antiquities. Persons having\r\n    right on this ground, will almost always have established it by ancient\r\n    usage, and the want of usage is a strong presumption against the right.\r\n\r\n    \"4. _Chiefs._--Lawful heirs-male of Chiefs of tribes or clans which had\r\n    attained power, and extensive territories and numerous members at a\r\n    distant period, or at least of tribes consisting of numerous families\r\n    of some degree of rank and consideration. Such persons will in general\r\n    have right to supporters, either as Barons (great or small) or by\r\n    ancient usage. When any new claim is set up on such a ground, it may be\r\n    viewed with suspicion, and it will be extremely difficult to establish\r\n    it, chiefly from the present state of society, by which the traces of\r\n    clanship, or the patriarchal state, are in most parts of the country\r\n    almost obliterated; and indeed it is very difficult to conceive a case\r\n    {423} in which a new claim of that kind could be admitted. Mr. Tait has\r\n    had some such claims, and has rejected them.\r\n\r\n    \"5. _Royal Commissions._--Knights of the Garter and Bath, and any\r\n    others to whom the King may think proper to concede the honour of\r\n    supporters.\r\n\r\n    \"These are the only descriptions of persons who appear to Mr. Tait to\r\n    be entitled to supporters.\r\n\r\n    \"An idea has gone abroad, that Scots Baronets are entitled to\r\n    supporters; but there is no authority for this in their patents, or any\r\n    good authority for it elsewhere. And for many years subsequent to 1672,\r\n    a very small portion indeed of their arms which are matriculated in the\r\n    Lyon Register, are matriculated with supporters; so small as\r\n    necessarily to lead to this inference, that those whose arms are\r\n    entered with supporters had right to them on other grounds, _e.g._\r\n    ancient usage, chieftainship, or being heirs of Barons. The arms of few\r\n    Scots Baronets are matriculated during the last fifty or sixty years;\r\n    but the practice of assigning supporters gradually gained ground during\r\n    that time, or rather the practice of assigning supporters to them,\r\n    merely as such, seems to have arisen during that period; and it appears\r\n    to Mr. Tait to be an erroneous practice, which he would not be\r\n    warranted in following.\r\n\r\n    \"British Baronets have also, by recent practice, had supporters\r\n    assigned to them, but Mr. Tait considers the practice to be\r\n    unwarranted; and accordingly, in a recent case, a gentleman, upon being\r\n    created a Baronet, applied for supporters to the King--having applied\r\n    to Mr. Tait, and been informed by him that he did not conceive the Lord\r\n    Lyon entitled to give supporters to British Baronets.\r\n\r\n    \"No females (except Peeresses in their own right) are entitled to\r\n    supporters, as the representation of families is only in the male line.\r\n    But the widows of Peers, by courtesy, carry their arms and supporters;\r\n    and the sons of Peers, using the lower titles of the peerage by\r\n    courtesy, also carry the supporters by courtesy.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Tait does not know of any authority for the Lord Lyon having a\r\n    discretionary power of granting supporters, and understands that only\r\n    the King has such a power.\r\n\r\n    \"Humbly submitted by\r\n\r\n                                                   (Signed) \"G. TAIT.\"\r\n\r\nThough this statement would give a good general idea of the Scottish\r\npractice, its publication entails the addition of certain qualifying\r\nremarks. Supporters are most certainly not \"commonly inserted in modern\r\npatents of peerage.\" Supporters appertaining to peerages are granted by\r\nspecial and separate patents. These to English subjects {424} are now under\r\nthe hand and seal of Garter alone. In the event of a grant following upon\r\nthe creation of an Irish peerage, the patent of supporters would be issued\r\nby Ulster King of Arms. But it is competent to Lyon King of Arms to\r\nmatriculate the arms of Scottish peers with supporters, or to grant these\r\nto such as may still be without them. Both Lyon and Ulster would appear to\r\nhave the right to grant supporters to Peers of the United Kingdom who are\r\nheraldically their domiciled subjects. With regard to the second paragraph\r\nof Mr. Tait's memorandum, there will be few families within its range who\r\nwill not be included within the range of the paragraph which follows, and\r\nthe presumption would rather be that the use of supporters by an untitled\r\nfamily originated in the right of barony than in any mythical grant\r\nfollowing upon mythical feats of valour.\r\n\r\nMr. Tait, however, is clearly wrong in his statement that \"no females\r\n(except peeresses in their own right) are entitled to supporters.\" They\r\nhave constantly been allowed to the heir of line, and their devolution\r\nthrough female heirs must of necessity presuppose the right thereto of the\r\nfemale heir through whom the inheritance is claimed. A recent case in point\r\noccurs with regard to the arms of Hunter-Weston, matriculated in 1880, Mrs.\r\nHunter-Weston being the heir of line of Hunter of Hunterston. Widows of\r\npeers, providing they have arms of their own to impale with those of their\r\nhusbands, cannot be said to only bear the supporters of their deceased\r\nhusbands by courtesy. With them it is a matter of right. The eldest sons of\r\npeers bearing courtesy titles most certainly do not bear the supporters of\r\nthe peerage to which they are heirs. Even the far more generally accepted\r\n\"courtesy\" practice of bearing coronets is expressly forbidden by an\r\nEarl-Marshal's Warrant.\r\n\r\nConsequently it may be asserted that the laws concerning the use of\r\nsupporters in Scotland are as follows: In the first place, no supporters\r\ncan be borne of right unless they have been the subject of formal grant or\r\nmatriculation. The following classes are entitled to obtain, upon payment\r\nof the necessary fees, the grant or matriculation of supporters to\r\nthemselves, or to themselves and their descendants according as the case\r\nmay be: (1) Peers of Scotland, and other peers who are domiciled Scotsmen.\r\n(2) Knights of the Garter, Knights of the Thistle, and Knights of St.\r\nPatrick, being Scotsmen, are entitled as such to obtain grants of\r\nsupporters to themselves for use during life, but as these three orders are\r\nnow confined to members of the peerage, the supporters used would be\r\nprobably those appertaining to their peerages, and it is unlikely that any\r\nfurther grants for life will be made under these circumstances. (3) Knights\r\nof the Bath until the revision of the order were entitled to obtain grants\r\nof supporters to themselves for {425} use during their lifetimes, and there\r\nare many instances in the Lyon Register where such grants have been made.\r\n(4) Knights Grand Cross of the Bath, of St. Michael and St. George, and of\r\nthe Royal Victorian Order, and Knights Grand Commanders of the Orders of\r\nthe Star of India, and of the Indian Empire, are entitled to obtain grants\r\nof supporters for use during their lifetimes. (5) The lawful heirs of the\r\nminor barons who had the full right of free barony prior to 1587 may\r\nmatriculate supporters if they can show their ancestors used them, or may\r\nnow obtain grants. Though practically the whole of these have been at some\r\ntime or other matriculated in Lyon Register, there still remain a few whose\r\nclaims have never been officially adjudicated upon. For example, it is only\r\nquite recently that the ancient Swinton supporters have been formally\r\nenrolled on the official records (Plate IV.). (6) There are certain others,\r\nbeing chiefs of clans and the heirs of those to whom grants have been made\r\nin times past, who also have the right, but as no new claim is likely to be\r\nso recognised in the future, it may be taken that these are confined to\r\nthose cases which have been already entered in the Lyon Register.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the eighteenth century, the executive of Lyon\r\nOffice had fallen into great disrepute. The office of Lyon King of Arms had\r\nbeen granted to the Earls of Kinnoul, who had contented themselves with\r\nappointing deputies and drawing fees. The whole subject of armorial\r\njurisdiction in Scotland had become lax to the last degree, and very many\r\nirregularities had crept in. One, and probably the worst result, had been\r\nthe granting of supporters in many cases where no valid reason other than\r\nthe payment of fees could be put forward to warrant the obtaining of such a\r\nprivilege. And the result was the growth and acceptance of the fixed idea\r\nthat it was within the power of Lyon King of Arms to grant supporters to\r\nany one whom he might choose to so favour. Consequently many grants of\r\nsupporters were placed upon the records, and many untitled families of\r\nScotland apparently have the right under these patents of grant to add\r\nsupporters to their arms. Though it is an arguable matter whether the Lord\r\nLyon was justified in making these grants, there can be no doubt that, so\r\nlong as they remain upon the official register, and no official steps are\r\ntaken to cancel the patents, they must be accepted as existing by legal\r\nright. Probably the most egregious instance of such a grant is to be found\r\nin the case of the grant to the first baronet of the family of Antrobus,\r\nwho on purchasing the estate of Rutherford, the seat of the extinct Lords\r\nRutherford, obtained from the then Lyon King of Arms a grant of the peerage\r\nsupporters carried by the previous owners of the property.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the devolution of Scottish supporters, the large {426}\r\nproportion of those registered in Lyon Office are recorded in the terms of\r\nsome patent which specifies the limitations of their descent, so that there\r\nare a comparatively small number only concerning which there can be any\r\nuncertainty as to whom the supporters will descend to. The difficulty can\r\nonly arise in those cases in which the arms are matriculated with\r\nsupporters as borne by ancient usage in the early years of the Lyon\r\nRegister, or in the cases of supporters still to be matriculated on the\r\nsame grounds by those families who have so far failed to comply with the\r\nAct of 1672. Whilst Mr. Tait, in his memorandum which has been previously\r\nquoted, would deny the right of inheritance to female heirs, there is no\r\ndoubt whatever that in many cases such heirs have been allowed to succeed\r\nto the supporters of their families. Taking supporters as an appanage of\r\nright of barony (either greater or lesser), there can be no doubt that the\r\ngreater baronies, and consequently the supporters attached to them,\r\ndevolved upon heirs female, and upon the heir of line inheriting through a\r\nfemale ancestor; and, presumably, the same considerations must of necessity\r\nhold good with regard to those supporters which are borne by right of\r\nlesser barony, for the greater and the lesser were the same thing,\r\ndiffering only in degree, until in the year 1587 the lesser barons were\r\nrelieved of compulsory attendance in Parliament. At the same time there can\r\nbe no doubt that the headship of a family must rest with the heir male, and\r\nconsequently it would seem that in those cases in which the supporters are\r\nborne by right of being head of a clan or chief of a name, the right of\r\ninheritance would devolve upon the heir male. There must of necessity be\r\nsome cases in which it is impossible to determine whether the supporters\r\nwere originally called into being by right of barony or because of\r\nchieftainship, and the consequence has been that concerning the descent of\r\nthe supporters of the older untitled families there has been no uniformity\r\nin the practice of Lyon Office, and it is impossible from the precedents\r\nwhich exist to deduce any certain and unalterable rule upon the point.\r\nPrecedents exist in each case, and the well-known case of Smith-Cunningham\r\nand Dick-Cunningham, which is often referred to as settling the point, did\r\nnothing of the kind, inasmuch as that judgment depended upon the\r\ninterpretation of a specific Act of Parliament, and was not the\r\ndetermination of a point of heraldic law. The case, however, afforded the\r\nopportunity to Lord Jeffrey to make the following remarks upon the point\r\n(see p. 355, Seton):--\r\n\r\n\"If I may be permitted to take a common-sense view, I should say that there\r\nis neither an inflexible rule nor a uniform practice in the matter. There\r\nmay be cases where the heir of line will exclude the heir male, and there\r\nmay be cases where the converse will be held. In {427} my opinion the\r\ncommon-sense rule is that the chief armorial dignities should follow the\r\nmore substantial rights and dignities of the family. _If the heir male\r\nsucceed to the title and estates, I think it reasonable that he should also\r\nsucceed to the armorial bearings of the head of the house._ I would think\r\nit a very difficult proposition to establish that the heir of line, when\r\ndenuded of everything else, was still entitled to retain the barren honours\r\nof heraldry. But I give no opinion upon that point.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Seton, in his \"Law and Practice of Heraldry in Scotland,\" sums up the\r\nmatter of inheritance in these words (see p. 357): \"As already indicated,\r\nhowever, by one of the learned Lords in his opinion on the case of\r\nCuninghame, the practice in the matter in question has been far from\r\nuniform; and accordingly we are very much disposed to go along with his\r\nrelative suggestion, that 'the chief armorial dignities should follow the\r\nmore substantial rights and dignities of the family'; and that when the\r\nlatter are enjoyed by the female heir of line, such heir should also be\r\nregarded as fairly entitled to claim the principal heraldic honours.\"\r\n\r\nThe result has been in practice that the supporters of a family have\r\nusually been matriculated to whoever has carried on the name and line of\r\nthe house, unless the supporters in question have been governed by a\r\nspecific grant, the limitations of which exist to be referred to, but in\r\ncases where both the heir of line and the heir male have been left in a\r\nprominent position, the difficulty of decision has in many cases been got\r\nover by allowing supporters to both of them. The most curious instance of\r\nthis within our knowledge occurs with regard to the family of Chisholm.\r\n\r\nChisholm of Erchless Castle appears undoubtedly to have succeeded as head\r\nand chief of his name--\"The Chisholm\"--about the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. As such supporters were carried, namely: \"On either side a savage\r\nwreathed about the head and middle with laurel, and holding a club over his\r\nexterior shoulder.\"\r\n\r\nAt the death of Alexander Chisholm--\"The Chisholm\"--7th February 1793, the\r\nchieftainship and the estates passed to his half-brother William, but his\r\nheir of line was his only child Mary, who married James Gooden of London.\r\nMrs. Mary Chisholm or Gooden in 1827 matriculated the _undifferenced_ arms\r\nof Chisholm [\"Gules, a boar's head couped or\"], without supporters, but in\r\n1831 the heir male _also_ matriculated the same _undifferenced_ arms, in\r\nthis case with supporters.\r\n\r\nThe chieftainship of the Chisholm family then continued with the male line\r\nuntil the death of Duncan Macdonell Chisholm--\"The Chisholm\"--in 1859, when\r\nhis only sister and heir became heir of line of the later chiefs. She was\r\nthen Jemima Batten, and by Royal {428} Licence in that year she and her\r\nhusband assumed the additional surname of Chisholm, becoming\r\nChisholm-Batten, and, contrary to the English practice in such cases, the\r\narms of Chisholm _alone_ were matriculated in 1860 to Mrs. Chisholm-Batten\r\nand her descendants. These once again were the _undifferenced_ coat of\r\nChisholm, viz.: \"Gules, a boar's head couped or.\" Arms for Batten have\r\nsince been granted in England, the domicile of the family being English,\r\nand the arms of the present Mr. Chisholm-Batten, though including the\r\nquartering for Chisholm, is usually marshalled as allowed in the College of\r\nArms by English rules.\r\n\r\nThough there does not appear to have been any subsequent rematriculation in\r\nfavour of the heir male who succeeded as \"The Chisholm,\" the undifferenced\r\narms were also considered to have devolved upon him together with the\r\nsupporters. On the death of the last known male heir of the family,\r\nRoderick Donald Matheson Chisholm, The Chisholm, in 1887, Mr. James\r\nChisholm Gooden-Chisholm claimed the chieftainship as heir of line, and in\r\nthat year the Gooden-Chisholm arms were again rematriculated. In this case\r\nsupporters were added to the again undifferenced arms of Chisholm, but a\r\nslight alteration in the supporters was made, the clubs being reversed and\r\nplaced to rest on the ground.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many other untitled Scottish families who rightly bear\r\nsupporters, may be mentioned Gibsone of Pentland, Barclay of Urie, Barclay\r\nof Towie, Drummond of Megginch, Maclachlan of that Ilk, \"Cluny\" Macpherson,\r\nCunninghame, and Brisbane of that Ilk.\r\n\r\nArmorial matters in the Channel Islands present a very unsatisfactory state\r\nof affairs. There never appears to have been any Visitation, and the arms\r\nof Channel Island families which officially pass muster must be confined to\r\nthose of the very few families (for example, De Carteret, Dobrée, and\r\nTupper) who have found it necessary or advisable on their own initiative to\r\nregister their arms in the official English sources. In none of these\r\ninstances have supporters been allowed, nor I believe did any of these\r\nfamilies claim to use them, but some (Lemprière, De Saumerez, and other\r\nfamilies) assert the possession of such a distinction by prescriptive\r\nright. If the right to supporters be a privilege of peerage, or if, as in\r\nScotland, it anciently depended upon the right of free barony, the position\r\nof these Channel Island families in former days as seignorial lords was\r\nmuch akin. But it is highly improbable that the right to bear supporters in\r\nsuch cases will ever be officially recognised, and the case of De Saumerez,\r\nin which the supporters were bedevilled and regranted to descend with the\r\npeerage, will probably operate as a decisive precedent upon the point and\r\nagainst such a right. There are some number of families {429} of foreign\r\norigin who bear supporters or claim them by the assertion of foreign right.\r\nWhere this right can be established their use has been confirmed by Royal\r\nLicence in this country in some number of cases; for example, the cases of\r\nRothschild and De Salis. In other cases (for example, the case of Chamier)\r\nno official record of the supporters exists with the record of the arms,\r\nand presumably the foreign right to the supporters could not have been\r\nestablished at the time of registration.\r\n\r\nWith regard to impersonal arms, the right to supporters in England is not\r\neasy to define. In the case of counties, crests and supporters are granted\r\nif the county likes to pay for them.\r\n\r\nIn the case of towns, the rule in England is that an ordinary town may not\r\nhave supporters but that a city may, and instances are numerous where\r\nsupporters have been granted upon the elevation of a town to the dignity of\r\na city. Birmingham, Sheffield, and Nottingham are all recent instances in\r\npoint. This rule, however, is not absolutely rigid, and an exception may be\r\npointed to in the case of Liverpool, the supporters being granted in 1797,\r\nand the town not being created a city until a subsequent date. In Scotland,\r\nwhere, of course, until quite recently supporters were granted practically\r\nto anybody who chose to pay for them, a grant will be found for the county\r\nof Perth dated in 1800, in which supporters were included. But as to towns\r\nand cities it is no more than a matter of fees, any town in Scotland\r\neligible for arms being at liberty to obtain supporters also if they are\r\ndesired. In grants of arms to corporate bodies it is difficult to draw the\r\nline or to deduce any actual rule. In 23rd of Henry VIII. the Grocers'\r\nLivery Company were granted \"two griffins per fess gules and or,\" and many\r\nother of the Livery Companies have supporters to their arms. Others, for no\r\napparent reason, are without them. The \"Merchant Adventurers' Company or\r\nHamburg Merchants\" have supporters, as had both the old and the new East\r\nIndia Companies. The arms of Jamaica and Cape Colony and of the British\r\nNorth Borneo Company have supporters, but on the other hand no supporters\r\nwere assigned to Canada or to any of its provinces. In Ireland the matter\r\nappears to be much upon the same footing as in England, and as far as\r\nimpersonal arms are concerned it is very difficult to say what the exact\r\nrule is, if this is to be deduced from known cases and past precedents.\r\n\r\nProbably the freedom--amounting in many cases to great laxity--with which\r\nin English heraldic art the positions and attitudes of supporters are\r\nchanged, is the one point in which English heraldic art has entirely\r\nignored the trammels of conventionalised officialism. There must be in this\r\ncountry scores of entrance gates where each {430} pillar of the gateway is\r\nsurmounted by a shield held in the paws of a single supporter, and the\r\nGovernmental use of the Royal supporters in an amazing variety of\r\nattitudes, some of which are grossly unheraldic, has not helped towards a\r\ntrue understanding. The reposeful attitude of watchful slumber in which the\r\nRoyal lion and unicorn are so often depicted, may perhaps be in the nature\r\nof submission to the Biblical teaching of Isaiah that the lion shall lie\r\ndown with the lamb (and possibly therefore also with the unicorn), in these\r\ntimes of peace which have succeeded those earlier days when \"the lion beat\r\nthe unicorn round and round the town.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 668.--The Arms used by Kilmarnock, Ayrshire: Azure, a\r\nfess chequy gules and argent. Crest: a dexter hand raised in benediction.\r\nSupporters: on either side a squirrel sejant proper.]\r\n\r\nIn official minds, however, the sole attitude for the supporters is the\r\nrampant, or as near an approach to it as the nature of the animal will\r\nallow. A human being, a bird, or a fish naturally can hardly adopt the\r\nattitude. In Scotland, the land of heraldic freedom, various exceptions to\r\nthis can be found. Of these one can call to mind the arms used by the town\r\nof Kilmarnock (Fig. 668), in which the supporters, \"squirrels proper,\" are\r\ndepicted always as sejant. These particular creatures, however, would look\r\nstrange to us in any other form. These arms unfortunately have never been\r\nmatriculated as the arms of the town (being really the arms of the Boyd\r\nfamily, the attainted Earls of Kilmarnock), and consequently can hardly as\r\nyet be referred to as a definite precedent, because official matriculation\r\nmight result in a similar \"happening\" to the change which was made in the\r\ncase of the arms of Inverness. In all representations of the arms of\r\nearlier date than the matriculation, the supporters, (dexter) {431} a camel\r\nand (sinister) an elephant, are depicted _statant_ on either side of the\r\nshield, no actual contact being made between the escutcheon and the\r\nsupporters. But in 1900, when in a belated compliance with the Act of 1672\r\nthe armorial bearings of the Royal Burgh of Inverness were matriculated,\r\nthe position was altered to that more usually employed for supporters.\r\n\r\nThe supporters always used by Sir John Maxwell Stirling-Maxwell of Pollok\r\nare two lions sejant guardant. These, as appears from an old seal, were in\r\nuse as far back as the commencement of the fifteenth century, but the\r\nsupporters officially recorded for the family are two apes. In English\r\narmory one or two exceptional cases may be noticed; for example, the\r\nsupporters of the city of Bristol, which are: \"On either side, on a mount\r\nvert, a unicorn sejant or, armed, maned, and unguled sable.\" Another\r\ninstance will be found in the supporters of Lord Rosmead, which are: \"On\r\nthe dexter side an ostrich and on the sinister side a kangaroo, both\r\nregardant proper.\" From the nature of the animal, the kangaroo is depicted\r\nsejant.\r\n\r\nSupporters in Germany date from the same period as with ourselves, being to\r\nbe met with on seals as far back as 1276. At first they were similarly\r\npurely artistic adjuncts, but they have retained much of this character and\r\nmuch of the purely permissive nature in Germany to the present day. It was\r\nnot until about the middle of the seventeenth century that supporters were\r\ngranted or became hereditary in that country. Grants of supporters can be\r\nfound in England at an earlier date, but such grants were isolated in\r\nnumber. Nevertheless supporters had become hereditary very soon after they\r\nobtained a regularly heraldic (as opposed to a decorative) footing. Their\r\nuse, however, was governed at that period by a greater freedom as to\r\nalteration and change than was customary with armory in general. Supporters\r\nwere an adjunct of the peerage, and peers were not subject to the\r\nVisitations. With his freedom from arrest, his high social position, and\r\nhis many other privileges of peerage, a peer was \"too big\" a person\r\nformerly to accept the dictatorial armorial control which the Crown\r\nenforced upon lesser people. Short of treason, a peer in any part of Great\r\nBritain for most practical purposes of social life was above the ordinary\r\nlaw. In actual fact it was only the rights of one peer as opposed to the\r\nrights of another peer that kept a Lord of Parliament under any semblance\r\nof control. When the great lords of past centuries could and did raise\r\narmies to fight the King a peer was hardly likely to, nor did he, brook\r\nmuch interference.\r\n\r\nOf the development of supporters in Germany Ströhl writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Only very late, about the middle of the seventeenth century, were\r\nsupporters granted as hereditary, but they appear in the arms of {432}\r\nburghers in the first half of the fifteenth century, and the arms of many\r\ntowns also possess them as decorative adjuncts.\r\n\r\n\"The first supporters were human figures, generally portraits of the\r\narms-bearers themselves; then women, young men, and boys, so-called\r\n_Schildbuben_. In the second half of the fourteenth century animals appear:\r\nlions, bears, stags, dogs, griffins, &c. In the fifteenth century one\r\nfrequently encounters angels with richly curling hair, saints (patrons of\r\nthe bearer or of the town), then later, nude wild men and women\r\n(_Waldmenschen_) thickly covered with hair, with garlands round their loins\r\nand on their heads. The thick, hairy covering of the body in the case of\r\nwomen is only to be met with in the very beginning. Later the endeavour was\r\nto approach the feminine ideal as nearly as possible, and only the garlands\r\nwere retained to point out the origin and the home of these figures.\r\n\r\n\"At the end of the fifteenth and in the sixteenth century, there came into\r\nfashion lansquenets, huntsmen, pretty women and girls, both clothed and\r\nunclothed.\" Speaking of the present day, and from the executive standpoint,\r\nhe adds:--\r\n\r\n\"Supporters, with the exception of flying angels, should have a footing on\r\nwhich they can stand in a natural manner, whether it be grass, a pedestal,\r\na tree, or line of ornament, and to place them upon a ribbon of a motto is\r\nless suitable because a thin ribbon can hardly give the impression of a\r\nsufficiently strong support for the invariably heavy-looking figures of the\r\nmen or animals. The supporters of the shield may at the same time be\r\nemployed as bearers of the helmets. They bear the helmets either over the\r\nhead or hold them in their hands. Figures standing near the shield, but not\r\nholding or supporting it in any way, cannot in the strict sense of the word\r\nbe designated supporters; such figures are called _Schildwächter_\r\n(shield-watchers or guardians).\"\r\n\r\nHUMAN FIGURES AS SUPPORTERS\r\n\r\nOf all figures employed as supporters probably human beings are of most\r\nfrequent occurrence, even when those single and double figures referred to\r\non an earlier page, which are not a real part of the heraldic achievement,\r\nare excluded from consideration. The endless variety of different figures\r\nperhaps gives some clue to the reason of their frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nThough the nude human figure appears (male) upon the shield of Dalziel and\r\n(female) in the crest of Ellis (Agar-Ellis, formerly Viscount Clifden), one\r\ncannot call to mind any instance of such an occurrence in the form of\r\nsupporters, though possibly the supporters of the {433} Glaziers' Livery\r\nCompany [\"Two naked boys proper, each holding a long torch inflamed of the\r\nlast\"] and of the Joiners' Livery Company [\"Two naked boys proper, the\r\ndexter holding in his hand an emblematical female figure, crowned with a\r\nmural coronet sable, the sinister holding in his hand a square\"] might be\r\nclassed in such a character. Nude figures in armory are practically always\r\ntermed \"savages,\" or occasionally \"woodmen\" or \"wildmen,\" and garlanded\r\nabout the loins with foliage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 669.--Arms of Arbroath: Gules, a portcullis with chains\r\npendent or. Motto: \"Propter Libertatem.\" Supporters: dexter, St. Thomas à\r\nBecket in his archiepiscopal robes all proper; sinister, a Baron of\r\nScotland armed cap-à-pie, holding in his exterior hand the letter from the\r\nConvention of the Scottish Estates, held at Arbroath in the year of 1320,\r\naddressed to Pope John XXII., all proper.]\r\n\r\nWith various adjuncts--clubs, banners, trees, branches, &c.--_Savages_ will\r\nbe found as the supporters of the arms of the German Emperor, and in the\r\nsovereign arms of Brunswick, Denmark, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, and\r\nRudolstadt, as well as in the arms of the kingdom of Prussia. They also\r\nappear in the arms of the kingdom of Greece, though in this case they\r\nshould perhaps be more properly described as figures of Hercules.\r\n\r\nIn British armory--amongst many other families--two savages are the\r\nsupporters of the Marquess of Ailesbury, Lord Calthorpe, Viscount de Vesci,\r\nLord Elphinstone, the Earl of Elgin and Kincardine, the Duke of Fife, Earl\r\nFitzwilliam (each holding in the exterior hand a tree eradicated), Lord\r\nKinnaird, the Earl of Morton; and amongst the baronets who possess\r\nsupporters, Menzies, Douglas of Carr, and Williams-Drummond have on either\r\nside of their escutcheons a \"savage.\" Earl Poulett alone has both man and\r\nwoman, his supporters being: \"Dexter, a savage man; sinister, a savage\r\nwoman, both wreathed with oak, all proper.\" As some one remarked on seeing\r\na realistic representation of this coat of arms by Catton, R.A., the blazon\r\nmight more appropriately have concluded \"all improper.\"\r\n\r\nNext after savages, the most favourite variety of the human being adopted\r\nas a supporter is the _Man in Armour_.\r\n\r\nEven as heraldic and heritable supporters angels are not uncommon, and are\r\nto be met with amongst other cases in the arms of the Marquess of\r\nWaterford, the Earl of Dudley, and Viscount Dillon.\r\n\r\nIt is rare to find supporters definitely stated to represent any specific\r\nperson, but in the case of the arms of Arbroath (Fig. 669) the supporters\r\nare \"Dexter: 'St. Thomas à Becket,' and sinister, a Baron of Scotland.\"\r\nAnother instance, again from Scotland, appears in a most extraordinary\r\ngrant by the Lyon in 1816 to Sir Jonathan Wathen Waller, Bart., of Braywick\r\nLodge, co. Berks, and of Twickenham, co. Middlesex. In this case the\r\nsupporters were two elaborately \"harnessed\" ancient warriors, \"to\r\ncommemorate the surrender of Charles, Duke of Orleans, at the memorable\r\nbattle of Agincourt (that word being the motto over the crest) in the year\r\n1415, to Richard Waller of Groombridge in Kent, Esq., from which Richard\r\nthe said {434} Sir Jonathan Wathen Waller is, according to the tradition of\r\nhis family, descended.\" This pedigree is set out in Burke's Peerage, which\r\nassigns as arms to this family the old coat of Waller of Groombridge, with\r\nthe augmented crest, viz.: \"On a mount vert, a walnut-tree proper, and\r\npendent therefrom an escutcheon of the arms of France with a label of three\r\npoints argent.\" Considerable doubt, however, is thrown upon the descent by\r\nthe fact that in 1814, when Sir Jonathan (then Mr. Phipps) obtained a Royal\r\nLicence to assume the name and arms of Waller, a very different and much\r\nbedevilled edition of the arms and not the real coat of Waller of\r\nGroombridge was exemplified to him. These supporters (the grant was quite\r\n_ultra vires_, Sir Jonathan being a domiciled Englishman) do not appear in\r\nany of the Peerage books, and it is not clear to what extent they were ever\r\nmade use of, but in a painting which came under my notice the Duke of\r\nOrleans, in his surcoat of France, could be observed handing his sword\r\nacross the front of the escutcheon to Mr. (or Sir) Richard Waller. The\r\nsupporters of the Needlemakers' Company are commonly known as Adam and Eve,\r\nand the motto of the Company [\"They sewed fig-leaves together and made\r\nthemselves aprons\"] bears this supposition out. The blazon, however, is:\r\n\"Dexter, a man; sinister, a woman, both proper, each wreathed round the\r\nwaist with leaves of the last, in the woman's dexter hand a needle or.\" The\r\nsupporters of the Earl of Aberdeen are, \"dexter an Earl and sinister a\r\nDoctor of Laws, both in their robes all proper.\"\r\n\r\nHighlanders in modern costume figure as supporters to the arms of\r\nMaconochie-Wellwood, and in more ancient garb in the case of Cluny\r\nMacpherson, and soldiers in the uniforms of every regiment, and savages\r\nfrom every clime, have at some time or other been pressed into heraldic\r\nservice as supporters; but a work on Armory is not a handbook on costume,\r\nmilitary and civil, nor is it an ethnographical directory, which it would\r\ncertainly become if any attempt were to be made to enumerate the different\r\nvarieties of men and women, clothed and unclothed, which have been used for\r\nthe purposes of supporters.\r\n\r\nANIMALS AS SUPPORTERS\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to animals as supporters, we at once get to a much wider\r\nrange, and but little can be said concerning them beyond stating that\r\nthough usually rampant, they are sometimes sejant, and may be guardant or\r\nregardant. One may, however, append examples of the work of different\r\nartists, which will doubtless serve as models, or possibly may develop\r\nideas in other artists. The _Lion_ naturally first claims {435} one's\r\nattention. Fig. 670 shows an interesting and curious instance of the use of\r\na single lion as a supporter. This is taken from a drawing in the\r\npossession of the town library at Breslau (_Herold_, 1888, No. 1), and\r\nrepresents the arms of Dr. Heinrich Rubische, Physician to the King of\r\nHungary and Bohemia. The arms are, \"per fesse,\" the chief argent, a \"point\"\r\nthroughout sable, charged with a lion's face, holding in the jaws an\r\nannulet, and the base also argent charged with two bars sable. The mantling\r\nis sable and argent. Upon the helmet as crest are two buffalo's horns of\r\nthe colours of the shield, and between them appears (apparently as a part\r\nof the heritable crest) a lion's face holding an annulet as in the arms.\r\nThis, however, is the face of the lion, which, standing behind the\r\nescutcheon, is employed as the supporter, though possibly it is intended\r\nthat it should do double duty. This employment of one animal to serve a\r\ndouble armorial purpose is practically unknown in British armory, except\r\npossibly in a few early examples of seals, but in German heraldry it is\r\nvery far from being uncommon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 670.--Arms of Dr. Heinrich Rubische.]\r\n\r\n{436}\r\n\r\nWinged lions are not very usual, but they occur as the supporters of Lord\r\nBraye: \"On either side a lion guardant or, winged vair.\" A winged lion is\r\nalso one of the supporters (the dexter) of Lord Leconfield, but this, owing\r\nto the position of the wings, is quite unique. The blazon is: \"A lion with\r\nwings inverted azure, collared or.\" Two lions rampant double-queued, the\r\ndexter or, the sinister sable, are the supporters of the Duke of Portland,\r\nand the supporters of both the Earl of Feversham and the Earl of Dartmouth\r\nafford instances of lions crowned with a coronet, and issuing therefrom a\r\nplume of ostrich feathers.\r\n\r\nSea-lions will be found as supporters to the arms of Viscount Falmouth\r\n[\"Two sea-lions erect on their tails argent, gutté-de-l'armes\"], and the\r\nEarl of Howth bears: \"Dexter, a sea-lion as in the crest; sinister, a\r\nmermaid proper, holding in her exterior hand a mirror.\"\r\n\r\nThe heraldic tiger is occasionally found as a supporter, and an instance\r\noccurs in the arms of the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava. It also occurs as\r\nthe sinister supporter of the Duke of Leeds, and of the Baroness Darcy de\r\nKnayth, and was the dexter supporter of the Earls of Holderness. Two\r\nheraldic tigers are the supporters both of Sir Andrew Noel Agnew, Bart.,\r\nand of the Marquess of Anglesey. Of recent years the natural tiger has\r\ntaken its place in the heraldic menagerie, and instances of its appearance\r\nwill be found in the arms of Sir Mortimer Durand, and as one of the\r\nsupporters of the arms of the city of Bombay. When occurring in heraldic\r\nsurroundings it is always termed for distinction a \"Bengal tiger,\" and two\r\nRoyal Bengal tigers are the supporters of Sir Francis Outram, Bart.: \"On\r\neither side a Royal Bengal tiger guardant proper, gorged with a wreath of\r\nlaurel vert, and on the head an Eastern crown or.\"\r\n\r\nThe griffin is perhaps the next most favourite supporter. Male griffins are\r\nthe supporters of Sir George John Egerton Dashwood: \"On either side a male\r\ngryphon argent, gorged with a collar flory counterflory gules.\"\r\n\r\nA very curious supporter is borne by Mr. Styleman Le Strange. Of course, as\r\na domiciled English commoner, having no Royal Licence to bear supporters,\r\nhis claim to these additions would not be recognised, but their use no\r\ndoubt originated in the fact that he represents the lines of several\r\ncoheirships to different baronies by writ, to some one of which, no doubt,\r\nthe supporters may have at some time belonged. The dexter supporter in\r\nquestion is \"a stag argent with a lion's forepaws and tail, collared.\"\r\n\r\nThe supporters recently granted to Lord Milner are two \"springbok,\" and the\r\nsame animal (an \"oryx\" or \"springbok\") is the sinister supporter of the\r\narms of Cape Colony. {437}\r\n\r\nGoats are the supporters of the Earl of Portsmouth (who styles his \"chamois\r\nor wild goats\"), of Lord Bagot and Lord Cranworth, and they occur in the\r\nachievements of the Barony of Ruthven and the Marquess of Normanby. The\r\nsupporters of Viscount Southwell are two \"Indian\" goats.\r\n\r\nRams are the supporters of Lord de Ramsey and Lord Sherard. A ram is also\r\none of the supporters attached to the Barony of Ruthven, and one of the\r\nsupporters used by the town of New Galloway. These arms, however, have\r\nnever been matriculated, which on account of the curious charge upon the\r\nshield is very much to be regretted.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of Lord Mowbray and Stourton afford an example of a most\r\ncurious and interesting animal. Originally the Lords Stourton used two\r\nantelopes azure, but before the seventeenth century these had been changed\r\nto two \"sea-dogs.\" When the abeyance of the Barony of Mowbray was\r\ndetermined in favour of Lord Stourton the dexter supporter was changed to\r\nthe lion of Mowbray, but the sinister supporter still remained a \"sea-dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe horse and the pegasus are constantly met with supporting the arms of\r\npeers and others in this country. A bay horse regardant figures as the\r\ndexter supporter of the Earl of Yarborough, and the horses which support\r\nthe shield of Earl Cowper are very specifically detailed in the official\r\nblazon: \"Two dun horses close cropped (except a tuft upon the withers) and\r\ndocked, a large blaze down the face, a black list down the back, and three\r\nwhite feet, viz. the hind-feet and near fore-foot.\" Lord Joicey has two\r\nShetland ponies and Lord Winterstoke has \"two horses sable, maned, tailed,\r\nand girthed or.\"\r\n\r\nThe arms of the City of London are always used with dragons for supporters,\r\nbut these supporters are not officially recorded. The arms of the City of\r\nLondon are referred to at greater length elsewhere in these pages. The town\r\nof Appleby uses dragons with wings expanded (most fearsome creatures), but\r\nthese are not official, nor are the \"dragons sejant addorsed gules, each\r\nholding an ostrich feather argent affixed to a scroll\" which some\r\nenterprising artist designed for Cheshire. Dragons will be found as\r\nsupporters to the arms of the Earl of Enniskillen, Lord St. Oswald, the\r\nEarl of Castlestuart, and Viscount Arbuthnot. The heraldic dragon is not\r\nthe only form of the creature now known to armory. The Chinese dragon was\r\ngranted to Lord Gough as one of his supporters, and it has since also been\r\ngranted as a supporter to Sir Robert Hart, Bart.\r\n\r\nWyverns are the supporters of the Earl of Meath and Lord Burghclere, and\r\nthe sinister supporter of both Lord Raglan and Lord Lyveden. {438}\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Royal Burgh of Dundee are quite unique. The official blazon\r\nruns: \"Azure, a pott of growing lillies argent, the escutcheon being\r\nsupported by two dragons, their tails nowed together underneath vert, with\r\nthis word in an escroll above a lilie growing out of the top of the shield\r\nas the former, 'Dei Donum.'\" Though blazoned as dragons, the creatures are\r\nundoubtedly wyverns.\r\n\r\nWyverns when figuring as supporters are usually represented standing on the\r\none claw and supporting the shield with the other, but in the case of the\r\nDuke of Marlborough, whose supporters are two wyverns, these are generally\r\nrepresented sejant erect, supporting the shield with both claws. This\r\nposition is also adopted for the wyvern supporters of Sir Robert Arbuthnot,\r\nBart., and the Earl of Eglinton.\r\n\r\nTwo cockatrices are the supporters of Lord Donoughmore, the Earl of\r\nWestmeath, and Sir Edmund Nugent, Bart., and the dexter supporter of Lord\r\nLanesborough is also a cockatrice.\r\n\r\nThe basilisk is the same creature as the cockatrice, and in the arms of the\r\ntown of Basle (German Basel), is an example of a supporter blazoned as a\r\nbasilisk. The arms are: \"Argent, a crosier sable.\" The supporter is a\r\nbasilisk vert, armed and jelloped gules.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of the Plasterers' Company, which were granted with the arms\r\n(January 15, 1556), are: \"Two opinaci (figures very similar to griffins)\r\nvert pursted (? purfled) or, beaked sable, the wings gules.\" The dexter\r\nsupporter of the arms of Cape Colony is a \"gnu.\"\r\n\r\nThe zebra, the giraffe, and the okapi are as yet unclaimed as supporters,\r\nthough the giraffe, under the name of the camelopard, figures in some\r\nnumber of cases as a crest, and there is at least one instance (Kemsley) of\r\na zebra as a crest. The ass, though there are some number of cases in which\r\nit appears as a crest or a charge, does not yet figure anywhere as a\r\nsupporter, nor does the mule. The hyena, the sacred cow of India, the\r\nbison, the giant-sloth, and the armadillo are all distinctive animals which\r\nstill remain to be withdrawn from the heraldic \"lucky bag\" of Garter. The\r\nmythical human-faced winged bull of Egyptian mythology, the harpy, and the\r\nfemale centaur would lend themselves well to the character of supporters.\r\n\r\nRobertson of Struan has no supporters matriculated with his arms, and it is\r\ndifficult to say for what length of time the supporters now in use have\r\nbeen adopted. But he is chief of his name, and the representative of one of\r\nthe minor barons, so that there is no doubt that supporters would be\r\nmatriculated to him if he cared to apply. Those supporters in use, viz.\r\n\"Dexter, a serpent; sinister, a dove, the heads of each encircled with\r\nrays,\" must surely be no less unique than is the strange compartment, \"a\r\nwild man lying in chains,\" which is borne {439} below the arms of Struan\r\nRobertson, and which was granted to his ancestor in 1451 for arresting the\r\nmurderers of King James I.\r\n\r\nThe supporters belonging to the city of Glasgow[26] are also unique, being\r\ntwo salmon, each holding a signet-ring in the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of the city of Waterford, though not recorded in Ulster's\r\nOffice, have been long enough in use to ensure their official\r\n\"confirmation\" if a request to this effect were to be properly put forward.\r\nThey are, on the dexter side a lion, and on the sinister side a dolphin.\r\nTwo dolphins azure, finned or, are the supporters of the Watermen and\r\nLightermen's Livery Company, and were granted 1655.\r\n\r\nBIRDS AS SUPPORTERS\r\n\r\nWhilst eagles are plentiful as supporters, nevertheless if eagles are\r\neliminated the proportion of supporters which are birds is not great.\r\n\r\nA certain variety and differentiation is obtained by altering the position\r\nof the wings, noticeably in regard to eagles, but these differences do not\r\nappear to be by any means closely adhered to by artists in pictorial\r\nrepresentations of armorial bearings.\r\n\r\nFig. 671 ought perhaps more properly to have been placed amongst those\r\neagles which, appearing as single figures, carry shields charged upon the\r\nbreast, but in the present case, in addition to the shield charged upon it\r\nin the usual manner, it so palpably supports the two other escutcheons,\r\nthat we are tempted to include it amongst definite supporters. The figure\r\nrepresents the arms of the free city of Nürnberg, and the design is\r\nreproduced from the title-page of the German edition of Andreas Vesili's\r\n_Anatomia_, printed at Nürnberg in 1537. The eagle is that of the German\r\nEmpire, carrying on its breast the impaled arms of Castile and Austria. The\r\nshields it supports may now be said both to belong to Nürnberg. The dexter\r\nshield, which is the coloured seal device of the old Imperial city, is:\r\n\"Azure, a harpy (in German _frauenadler_ or maiden eagle) displayed and\r\ncrowned or.\" The sinister shield (which may more properly be considered the\r\nreal arms of Nürnberg) is: \"Per pale or, a double-headed Imperial eagle\r\ndisplayed, dimidiated with bendy of six gules and argent.\" {440}\r\n\r\nThe supporters of Lord Amherst of Hackney are two _Herons_: \"On either side\r\na heron proper, collared or.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 671.--The Arms of Nürnberg.]\r\n\r\nThe city of Calcutta, to which arms and supporters were granted in 1896,\r\nhas for its supporters _Adjutant Birds_, which closely approximate to\r\nstorks. Two woodpeckers have recently been granted as the supporters of\r\nLord Peckover. {441}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE COMPARTMENT\r\n\r\nA compartment is anything depicted below the shield as a foothold or\r\nresting-place for the supporters, or indeed for the shield itself.\r\nSometimes it is a fixed part of the blazon and a constituent part of the\r\nheritable heraldic bearings. At other times it is a matter of mere artistic\r\nfancy, and no fixed rules exist to regulate or control nor even to check\r\nthe imagination of the heraldic artist. The fact remains that supporters\r\nmust have something to stand upon, and if the blazon supplies nothing, the\r\ndiscretion of the artist is allowed considerable laxity.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of compartments a great deal of diversity of opinion exists.\r\nThere is no doubt that in early days and early examples supporters were\r\nplaced to stand upon some secure footing, but with the decadence of\r\nheraldic art in the seventeenth century came the introduction of the gilded\r\n\"freehand copy\" scroll with which we are so painfully familiar, which one\r\nwriter has aptly termed the heraldic gas-bracket. Arising doubtless from\r\nand following upon the earlier habit of balancing the supporters upon the\r\nunstable footing afforded by the edge of the motto scroll, the\r\n\"gas-bracket\" was probably accepted as less open to objection. It certainly\r\nwas not out of keeping with the heraldic art of the period to which it owed\r\nits evolution, or with the style of armorial design of which it formed a\r\npart. It still remains the accepted and \"official\" style and type in\r\nEngland, but Scotland and Ireland have discarded it, and \"compartments\" in\r\nthose countries are now depicted of a nature requiring less gymnastic\r\nability on the part of the animals to which they afford a foothold. The\r\nstyle of compartment is practically always a matter of artistic taste and\r\ndesign. With a few exceptions it is always entirely disregarded in the\r\nblazon of the patent, and the necessity of something for the supporters to\r\nstand upon is as much an understood thing as is the existence of a shield\r\nwhereon the arms are to be displayed. But as the shape of the shield is\r\nleft to the fancy of the artist, so is the character of the compartment,\r\nand the Lyon Register nowadays affords examples of achievements where the\r\nsupporters stand on rocks and flowery mounds {442} or issue from a watery\r\nabiding-place. The example set by the Lyon Register has been eagerly\r\nfollowed by most heraldic artists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 672.]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious commentary upon the heraldic art of the close of the\r\neighteenth and the early part of the nineteenth centuries that whilst the\r\ngymnastic capabilities of animals were admitted to be equal to \"tight-rope\"\r\nexhibitions of balancing upon the ordinary scroll, these feats were not\r\nconsidered practicable in the case of human beings, for whom little square\r\nplatforms were always provided. Fig. 672, which represents the sinister\r\nsupporter of Lord Scarsdale (viz. the figure of Liberality represented by a\r\nwoman habited argent, mantled purpure, holding a cornucopia proper) shows\r\nthe method by which platform accommodation was provided for human figures\r\nwhen acting as supporters.\r\n\r\nAt the same time this greater freedom of design may occasionally lead to\r\nmistakes in relation to English supporters and their compartments.\r\nFollowing upon the English practice already referred to of differentiating\r\nthe supporters of different families, it has apparently been found\r\nnecessary in some cases to place the supporters to stand upon a definite\r\nobject, which object is recited in the blazon and becomes an integral and\r\nunchangeable portion of the supporter. Thus Lord Torrington's supporters\r\nare each placed upon dismounted ships' guns [\"Dexter, an heraldic antelope\r\nermine, horned, tusked, maned and hoofed or, standing on a ship gun proper;\r\nsinister, a sea-horse proper, on a like gun\"], Lord Hawke's[27] dexter\r\nsupporter rests his sinister foot upon a dolphin, and Lord Herschell's\r\nsupporters each stand upon a fasces [\"Supporters: on either side a stag\r\nproper, collared azure, standing on a fasces or\"]. The supporters of Lord\r\nIveagh each rest a hind-foot upon an escutcheon [\"Supporters: on either\r\nside a stag gules, attired and collared gemel or, resting the inner hoof on\r\nan escutcheon vert charged with a lion rampant of the second\"], whilst the\r\ninner hind-foot of each of Lord Burton's supporters {443} rests upon a\r\nstag's head caboshed proper. Probably absurdity could go no further. But in\r\nthe case of the supporters granted to Cape Town (Fig. 673), the official\r\nblazon runs as follows: \"On the dexter {444} side, standing on a rock, a\r\nfemale figure proper, vested argent, mantle and sandals azure, on her head\r\nan estoile radiated or, and supporting with her exterior hand an anchor\r\nalso proper; and on the sinister side, standing on a like rock, a lion\r\nrampant guardant gules.\" In this case it will be seen that the rocks form\r\nan integral part of the supporters, and are not merely an artistic\r\nrendering of the compartment. The illustration, which was made from an\r\nofficial drawing supplied from the Heralds' College, shows the curious way\r\nin which the motto scroll is made to answer the purpose of the compartment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 673.--Arms of Cape Town: Or, an anchor erect sable,\r\nstock proper, from the ring a riband flowing azure, and suspended therefrom\r\nan escocheon gules charged with three annulets of the field; and for the\r\ncrest, on a wreath of the colours, upon the battlements of a tower proper,\r\na trident in bend dexter or, surmounted by an anchor and cable in bend\r\nsinister sable.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally the compartment itself--as a thing apart from the\r\nsupporters--receives attention in the blazon, _e.g._ in the case of the\r\narms of Baron de Worms, which are of foreign origin, recorded in this\r\ncountry by Royal Warrant. His supporters are: \"On a bronze compartment, on\r\neither side a lion gold, collared and chained or, and pendent from the\r\ncompartment a golden scroll, thereon in letters gules the motto, 'Vinctus\r\nnon victus.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom the motto \"Dieu et mon Droit\" is\r\nrequired to be on the compartment below the shield, and thereon the Union\r\nBadge of the Rose, Thistle, and Shamrock engrafted on the same stem.\r\n\r\nThe city of Norwich is not officially recognised as having the right to\r\nsupporters, and doubtless those in use have originated in the old artistic\r\ncustom, previously referred to, of putting escutcheons of arms under the\r\nguardianship of angels. They may be so deciphered upon an old stone carving\r\nupon one of the municipal buildings in that city. The result has been that\r\ntwo angels have been regularly adopted as the heraldic supporters of the\r\ncity arms. The point that renders them worthy of notice is that they are\r\ninvariably represented each standing upon its own little pile of clouds.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Royal Burgh of Montrose (Forfarshire) afford an official\r\ninstance of another variety in the way of a compartment, which is a fixed\r\nmatter of blazon and not depending upon artistic fancy. The entry in Lyon\r\nRegister is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The Royal Burgh of Montrose gives for Ensignes Armoriall, Argent, a rose\r\ngules. The shield adorned with helmet, mantling, and wreath suteable\r\nthereto. And for a crest, a hand issuing from a cloud and reaching down a\r\ngarland of roses proper, supported by two mermaids aryseing from the sea\r\nproper. The motto, 'Mare ditat Rosa decorat.' And for a revers, Gules, St.\r\nPeter on the cross proper, with the keyes hanging at his girdle or. Which\r\nArms, &c., Ext. December 16, 1694.\"\r\n\r\nAn English example may be found in the case of the arms of {445}\r\nBoston,[28] which are depicted with the supporters (again two mermaids)\r\nrising from the sea, though to what extent the sea is a fixed and\r\nunchangeable part of the achievement in this case is less a matter of\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nProbably of all the curious \"supporters\" to be found in British armory,\r\nthose of the city of Southampton (Plate VII.) must be admitted to be the\r\nmost unusual. As far as the actual usage of the arms by the corporation is\r\nconcerned, one seldom if ever sees more than the simple shield employed.\r\nThis bears the arms: \"Per fess gules and argent, three roses\r\ncounterchanged.\" But in the official record of the arms in one of the\r\nVisitation books a crest is added, namely: \"Upon a mount vert, a double\r\ntower or, and issuing from the upper battlements thereof a demi-female\r\naffronté proper, vested purpure, crined and crowned with an Eastern coronet\r\nalso or, holding in her dexter hand a sword erect point upwards argent,\r\npommel and hilt of the second, and in her sinister hand a balance sable,\r\nthe pans gold. The shield in the Visitation book rests upon a mount vert,\r\nissuing from waves of the sea, and thereupon placed on either side of the\r\nescutcheon a ship of two masts at anchor, the sails furled all proper, the\r\nround top or, and from each masthead flying a banner of St. George, and\r\nupon the stern of each vessel a lion rampant or, supporting the\r\nescutcheon.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that in England the compartment is so much a matter of\r\ncourse, it is scarcely ever alluded to, and the _term_ \"Compartment\" is\r\npractically one peculiar to Scottish heraldry. It does not appear to be a\r\nvery ancient heraldic appendage, and was probably found to be a convenient\r\narrangement when shields were depicted erect instead of couché, so as to\r\nsupply a resting-place (or standpoint) for the supporters. In a few\r\ninstances the compartment appears on seals with couché shields, on which,\r\nhowever, the supporters are usually represented as resting _on the sides of\r\nthe escutcheon_, and bearing up the helmet and crest, as already mentioned.\r\nSir George Mackenzie conjectures that the compartment \"represents the\r\nbearer's land and territories, though sometimes (he adds) it is bestowed in\r\nrecompense of some honourable action.\" Thus the Earls of Douglas are said\r\nto have obtained the privilege of placing their supporters with a pale of\r\nwood wreathed, because the doughty lord, in the reign of King Robert the\r\nBruce, defeated the English in Jedburgh Forest, and \"caused wreathe and\r\nimpale,\" during the night, that part of the wood by which he conjectured\r\nthey might make their escape. Such a fenced compartment appears on the seal\r\nof James Douglas, second Earl of Angus, \"Dominus de Abernethie et Jedworth\r\nForest\" (1434), on {446} that of George Douglas, fourth Earl (1459), and\r\nalso on those of several of his successors in the earldom (1511-1617). A\r\nstill earlier example, however, of a compartment \"representing a park with\r\ntrees, &c., enclosed by a wattled fence,\" occurs on the seal of Walter\r\nStewart, Earl of Atholl (_c._ 1430), where the escutcheon is placed in the\r\nentrance to the park between two trees. Nisbet refers to a seal of William,\r\nfirst Earl of Douglas (1377), exhibiting a single supporter (a lion)\r\n\"sitting on a compartment like to a rising ground, with a tree growing out\r\nof it, and semé of hearts, mullets, and cross crosslets,\" these being the\r\ncharges of Douglas and Mar in the escutcheon.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir George Mackenzie, these compartments were usually allowed\r\nonly to sovereign princes; and he further informs us that, besides the\r\nDouglases, he knows of no other subject in Britain, except the Earl of\r\nPerth, whose arms stand upon a compartment. In the case of the Perth\r\nfamily, the compartment consists of a green hill or mount, semé of\r\ncaltraps[29] (or cheval-traps), with the relative motto, \"Gang warily,\"\r\nabove the achievement. \"Albeit of late,\" says Mackenzie, \"compartments are\r\nbecome more common, and some families in Scotland have some creatures upon\r\nwhich their achievement stands, as the Laird of Dundas, whose achievement\r\nhas for many hundreds of years stood upon a salamander in flames proper (a\r\ndevice of the kings of France), and Robertson of Struan has a monstrous man\r\nlying under the escutcheon chained, which was given him for his taking the\r\nmurderer of James I....\" Such figures, however, as Nisbet remarks, cannot\r\nproperly be called compartments, having rather the character of devices;\r\nwhile, in the case of the Struan achievement, the chained man would be more\r\naccurately described as \"an honourable supporter.\" Sir George Mackenzie\r\nengraves \"the coat of Denham of ould,\" viz. a stag's head \"caboshed,\" below\r\na shield couché charged with three lozenges, or fusils, conjoined in bend.\r\nIn like manner, Nisbet represents the crest and motto of the Scotts of\r\nThirlstane, \"by way of compartment,\" below the escutcheon of Lord Napier,\r\nand a blazing star, with the legend \"Luceo boreale,\" under that of Captain\r\nRobert Seton, of the family of Meldrum; while in the case of the\r\nillumination which accompanies the latest entry in the first volume of the\r\nLyon Register (1804), relative to the arms of John Hepburn Belshes of\r\nInvermay, the trunk of an oak-tree sprouting forth anew is placed on a\r\ncompartment under the shield, with the motto, \"Revirescit.\"\r\n\r\nTwo other instances of regular compartments are mentioned by Nisbet, viz.\r\nthose carried by the Macfarlanes of that Ilk and the Ogilvies of\r\nInnerquharity. The former consists of a wavy {447} representation of Loch\r\nSloy, the gathering-place of the clan, which word is also inscribed on the\r\ncompartment as their _cri-de-guerre_ or slogan; while the latter is a\r\n\"green hill or rising terrace,\" on which are placed two serpents, \"nowed,\"\r\nspouting fire, and the motto, \"Terrena pericula sperno.\" For some of the\r\nforegoing instances I am indebted to Seton's well-known \"Law and Practice\r\nof Heraldry in Scotland.\" {448}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nMOTTOES\r\n\r\nTo the uninitiated, the subject of the motto of a family has a far greater\r\nimportance than is conceded to it by those who have spent any time in the\r\nstudy of armory. Perhaps it may clear the ground if the rules presently in\r\nforce are first recited. It should be carefully observed that the status of\r\nthe motto is vastly different in England and in other countries. Except in\r\nthe cases of impersonal arms (and not always then), the motto is never\r\nmentioned or alluded to in the terms of the patent in a grant of arms in\r\nEngland; consequently they are not a part of the \"estate\" created by the\r\nLetters Patent, though if it be desired a motto will always be painted\r\nbelow the emblazonment in the margin of the patent. Briefly speaking, the\r\nposition in England with regard to personal armorial bearings is that\r\nmottoes are _not hereditary_. No one is compelled to bear one, nor is any\r\nauthority needed for the adoption of a motto, the matter is left purely to\r\nthe personal pleasure of every individual; but if that person elects to use\r\na motto, the officers of arms are perfectly willing to paint any motto he\r\nmay choose upon his grant, and to add it to the record of his arms in their\r\nbooks. There is no necessity expressed or implied to use a motto at all,\r\nnor is the slightest control exercised over the selection or change of\r\nmottoes, though, as would naturally be expected, the officers of arms would\r\ndecline to record to any private person any motto which might have been\r\nappropriated to the sovereign or to any of the orders of knighthood. In the\r\nsame way no control is exercised over the position in which the motto is to\r\nbe carried or the manner in which it is to be displayed.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, however, the matter is on an entirely different footing. The\r\nmotto is included within the terms of the patent, and is consequently made\r\nthe subject of grant. It therefore becomes inalienable and unchangeable\r\nwithout a rematriculation, and a Scottish patent moreover always specifies\r\nthe position in which the motto is to be carried. This is usually \"in an\r\nescroll over the same\" (_i.e._ over the crest), though occasionally it is\r\nstated to be borne on \"a compartment below the arms.\" The matter in Ireland\r\nis not quite the same as in {449} either Scotland or England. Sometimes the\r\nmotto is expressed in the patent--in fact this is now the more usual\r\nalternative--but the rule is not universal, and to a certain extent the\r\nEnglish permissiveness is recognised. Possibly the subject can be summed up\r\nin the remark that if any motto has been granted or is recorded with a\r\nparticular coat of arms in Ireland, it is expected that that shall be the\r\nmotto to be made use of therewith.\r\n\r\nAs a general practice the use of mottoes in England did not become general\r\nuntil the eighteenth century--in fact there are very few, if any, grants of\r\nan earlier date on which a motto appears. The majority, well on towards the\r\nlatter part of the eighteenth century, had no motto added, and many patents\r\nare still issued without such an addition. With rare exceptions, no mottoes\r\nare to be met with in the Visitation books, and it does not appear that at\r\nthe time of the Visitations the motto was considered to be essentially a\r\npart of the armorial bearings. The one or two exceptions which I have met\r\nwith where mottoes are to be found on Visitation pedigrees are in every\r\ncase the arms of a peer. There are at least two such in the Yorkshire\r\nVisitation of 1587, and probably it may be taken for granted that the\r\nmajority of peers at that period had begun to make use of these additions\r\nto their arms. Unfortunately we have no exact means of deciding the point,\r\nbecause peers were not compelled to attend a Visitation, and there are but\r\nfew cases in which the arms or pedigree of a peer figure in the Visitation\r\nbooks. In isolated cases the use of a motto can, however, be traced back to\r\nan even earlier period. There are several instances to be met with upon the\r\nearly Garter plates.\r\n\r\nMany writers have traced the origin of mottoes to the \"slogan\" or war-cry\r\nof battle, and there is no doubt whatever that instances can be found in\r\nwhich an ancient war-cry has become a family motto. For example, one can\r\nrefer to the Fitzgerald \"Crom-a-boo\": other instances can be found amongst\r\nsome of the Highland families, but the fact that many well-known war-cries\r\nof ancient days never became perpetuated as mottoes, and also the fact that\r\nby far the greater number of mottoes, even at a much earlier period than\r\nthe present day, cannot by any possibility have ever been used for or have\r\noriginated with the purposes of battle-cries, inclines me to believe that\r\nsuch a suggested origin for the motto in general is without adequate\r\nfoundation. There can be little if any connection between the war-cry as\r\nsuch and the motto as such. The real origin would appear to be more\r\ncorrectly traced back to the badge. As will be found explained elsewhere,\r\nthe badge was some simple device used for personal and household purposes\r\nand seldom for war, except by persons who used the badge of the leader they\r\nfollowed. No man wore his own badge {450} in battle. It generally partook\r\nof the nature of what ancient writers would term \"a quaint conceit,\" and\r\nmuch ingenuity seems to have been expended in devising badges and mottoes\r\nwhich should at the same time be distinctive and should equally be or\r\nconvey an index or suggestion of the name and family of the owner. Many of\r\nthese badges are found in conjunction with words, mottoes, and phrases, and\r\nas the distinction between the badge in general and the crest in general\r\nslowly became less apparent, they eventually in practice became\r\ninterchangeable devices, if the same device did not happen to be used for\r\nboth purposes. Consequently the motto from the badge became attached to the\r\ncrest, and was thence transferred to its present connection with the coat\r\nof arms. Just as at the present time a man may and often does adopt a maxim\r\nupon which he will model his life, some pithy proverb, or some trite\r\nobservation, without any question or reference to armorial bearings--so, in\r\nthe old days, when learning was less diffuse and when proverbs and sayings\r\nhad a wider acceptance and vogue than at present, did many families and\r\nmany men adopt for their use some form of words. We find these words carved\r\non furniture, set up on a cornice, cut in stone, and embroidered upon\r\nstandards and banners, and it is to this custom that we should look for the\r\nbeginning of the use of mottoes. But because such words were afterwards in\r\nlater generations given an armorial status, it is not justifiable to\r\npresume such status for them from their beginnings. The fact that a man put\r\nhis badges on the standard that he carried into battle, and with his badges\r\nplaced the mottoes that thereto belonged, has led many people mistakenly to\r\nbelieve that these mottoes were _designed_ for war-cries and for use in\r\nbattle. That was not the case. In fact it seems more likely that the bulk\r\nof the standards recorded in the books of the heralds which show a motto\r\nwere never carried in battle.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the mottoes in use at the moment, some of course can be\r\ntraced to a remote period, and many of the later ones have interesting\r\nlegends connected therewith. Of mottoes of this character may be instanced\r\nthe \"Jour de ma vie\" of West, which was formerly the motto of the La Warr\r\nfamily, adopted to commemorate the capture of the King of France at the\r\nbattle of Poictiers. There are many other mottoes of this character,\r\namongst which may be mentioned the \"Grip fast\" of the Leslies, the origin\r\nof which is well known. But though many mottoes relate to incidents in the\r\nremote past, true or mythical, the motto and the incident are seldom\r\ncontemporary. Nothing would be gained by a recital of a long list of\r\nmottoes, but I cannot forbear from quoting certain curious examples which\r\nby their very weirdness must excite curiosity as to their origin. A family\r\nof Martin used the singular words, \"He who looks at Martin's {451} ape,\r\nMartin's ape shall look at him,\" whilst the Curzons use, \"Let Curzon hold\r\nwhat Curzon helde.\" The Cranston motto is still more grasping, being, \"Thou\r\nshalt want ere I want;\" but probably the motto of the Dakyns is the most\r\nmysterious of all, \"Strike Dakyns, the devil's in the hempe.\" The motto of\r\nCorbet, \"Deus pascit corvos,\" evidently alludes to the raven or ravens\r\n(corby crows) upon the shield. The mottoes of Trafford, \"Now thus,\" and\r\n\"Gripe griffin, hold fast;\" the curious Pilkington motto, \"Pilkington\r\nPailedown, the master mows the meadows;\" and the \"Serva jugum\" of Hay have\r\nbeen the foundation of many legends. The \"Fuimus\" of the Bruce family is a\r\npathetic allusion to the fact that they were once kings, but the majority\r\nof ancient mottoes partake rather of the nature of a pun upon the name,\r\nwhich fact is but an additional argument towards the supposition that the\r\nmotto has more relation to the badge than to any other part of the armorial\r\nbearings. Of mottoes which have a punning character may be mentioned \"Mon\r\nDieu est ma roche,\" which is the motto of Roche, Lord Fermoy; \"Cavendo\r\ntutus,\" which is the motto of Cavendish; \"Forte scutum salus ducum,\" which\r\nis the motto of Fortescue; \"Set on,\" which is the motto of Seton; \"Da fydd\"\r\nof Davies, and \"Ver non semper viret,\" the well-known pun of the Vernons.\r\nAnother is the apocryphal \"Quid rides\" which Theodore Hook suggested for\r\nthe wealthy and retired tobacconist. This punning character has of late\r\nobtained much favour, and wherever a name lends itself to a pun the effort\r\nseems nowadays to be made that the motto shall be of this nature. Perhaps\r\nthe best pun which exists is to be found in the motto of the Barnard\r\nfamily, who, with arms \"Argent, a bear rampant sable, muzzled or,\" and\r\ncrest \"A demi-bear as in the arms,\" use for the motto, \"Bear and Forbear,\"\r\nor in Latin, as it is sometimes used, \"Fer et perfer.\" Others that may be\r\nalluded to are the \"What I win I keep\" of Winlaw; the \"Libertas\" of\r\nLiberty; the \"Ubi crux ibi lux\" of Sir William Crookes; the \"Bear thee\r\nwell\" of Bardwell; the \"Gare le pied fort\" of Bedford; the \"Gare la bête\"\r\nof Garbett; and the \"Cave Deus videt\" of Cave. Other mottoes--and they are\r\na large proportion--are of some saintly and religious tendency. However\r\ndesirable and acceptable they may be, and however accurately they may apply\r\nto the first possessor, they sometimes are sadly inappropriate to later and\r\nmore degenerate successors.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, a distinction appears to be drawn between their \"Wahlsprüche\"\r\n(_i.e._ those which are merely dictated by personal choice) and the\r\n\"armorial mottoes\" which remained constantly and heritably attached to the\r\narmorial bearings, such as the \"Gott mit uns\" (\"God with us\") of Prussia\r\nand the \"Nihil sine Deus\" of Hohenzollern. {452}\r\n\r\nThe Initial or Riddle Mottoes appear to be peculiar to Germany. Well-known\r\nexamples of these curiosities are the \"W. G. W.\" (_i.e._ \"Wie Gott\r\nwill\"--\"As God wills\"), or \"W. D. W.\" (_i.e._ \"Wie du willst\"--\"As thou\r\nwilt\"), which are both frequently to be met with. The strange but\r\nwell-known alphabet or vowel-motto \"A. E. I. O. V.\" of the Emperor\r\nFrederick III. has been variously translated, \"Aquila Electa Juste Omnia\r\nVincit\" (\"The chosen eagle vanquishes all by right\"), \"Aller Ehren Ist\r\nOesterrich Voll\" (\"Austria is full of every honour\"), or perhaps with more\r\nlikelihood, \"Austria Est Imperare Orbe Universo\" (\"All the earth is subject\r\nto Austria\").\r\n\r\nThe _cri-de-guerre_, both as a heraldic fact and as an armorial term, is\r\npeculiar, and exclusively so, to British and French heraldry. The national\r\n_cri-de-guerre_ of France, \"Montjoye Saint Denis,\" appeared above the\r\npavilion in the old Royal Arms of France, and probably the English Royal\r\nmotto, \"Dieu et mon Droit,\" is correctly traced to a similar origin. A\r\ndistinction is still made in modern heraldry between the _cri-de-guerre_\r\nand the motto, inasmuch as it is considered that the former should always\r\nof necessity surmount the crest. This is very generally adhered to in\r\nScotland in the cases where both a motto and a _cri-de-guerre_ (or, as it\r\nis frequently termed in that country, a \"slogan\") exist, the motto,\r\ncontrary to the usual Scottish practice, being then placed below the\r\nshield. It is to be hoped that a general knowledge of this fact will not,\r\nhowever, result in the description of every motto found above a crest as a\r\n_cri-de-guerre_, and certainly the concentrated piety now so much in favour\r\nin England for the purposes of a motto can be quite fitly left below the\r\nshield.\r\n\r\nArtists do not look kindly on the motto for decorative purposes. It has\r\nbeen usually depicted in heraldic emblazonment in black letters upon a\r\nwhite scroll, tinted and shaded with pink, but with the present revival of\r\nheraldic art, it has become more general to paint the motto ribbon in\r\nconformity with the colour of the field, the letters being often shown\r\nthereon in gold. The colour and shape of the motto ribbon, however, are\r\ngoverned by no heraldic laws, and except in Scottish examples should be\r\nleft, as they are purely unimportant accessories of the achievement, wholly\r\nat the discretion of the artist. {453}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nBADGES\r\n\r\nThe exact status of the badge in this country, to which it is peculiar, has\r\nbeen very much misunderstood. This is probably due to the fact that the\r\nevolution of the badge was gradual, and that its importance increased\r\nunconsciously. Badges do not formerly appear to have ever been made the\r\nsubjects of grants, and the instances which can be referred to showing\r\ntheir control, or attempted control, by the Crown in past times are _very\r\nrare indeed_. As a matter of fact, the Crown seems to have perhaps\r\npurposely ignored them. They are not, as we know them, found in the\r\nearliest times of heraldry, unless we are to presume their existence from\r\nearly seals, many of which show isolated charges taken from the arms; for\r\nif in the cases where such charges appear upon the seals we are to accept\r\nthose seals as proofs of the contemporary existence of those devices as\r\nheraldic badges, we should often be led into strange conclusions.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that these isolated devices which are met with were not\r\nonly a part of the arms, but in many cases the _origin_ of the arms.\r\nDevices possessing a more or less personal and possessive character occur\r\nin many cases before record of the arms they later developed into can be\r\ntraced. This will be noticed in relation to the arms of Swinton, to which\r\nreference is made elsewhere. If these are badges, then badges go back to an\r\nearlier date than arms. Such devices occur many centuries before such a\r\nthing as a shield of arms existed.\r\n\r\nThe _Heraldic Badge, as we know it_, came into general use about the reign\r\nof Edward III., that is, the heraldic badge as a separate matter having a\r\ndistinct existence in addition to concurrent arms, and having at the same\r\ntime a distinctly heraldic character. But long before that date, badges are\r\nfound with an allied reference to a particular person, which very possibly\r\nare rightly included in any enumeration of badges. Of such a character is\r\nthe badge of the broom plant, which is found upon the tomb of Geoffrey,\r\nCount of Anjou, from which badge the name of the Plantagenet dynasty\r\noriginated (Plantagenet, by the way, was never a personal surname, but was\r\nthe name of the dynasty). {454}\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful, however, if at that early period there existed much if\r\nindeed any opportunity for the use of heraldic badges. At the same time, as\r\nfar back as the reign of Richard I.--and some writers would take examples\r\nof a still more remote period--these badges must have been occasionally\r\ndepicted upon banners, for Richard I. appears to have had a dragon upon one\r\nof his banners.\r\n\r\nThese banner decorations, which at a later date have been often accepted as\r\nbadges, can hardly be quite properly so described, for there are many cases\r\nwhere no other proof of usage can be found, and there is no doubt that many\r\nsuch are instances of no more than banners prepared for specific purposes;\r\nand the record of such and such a banner cannot necessarily carry proof\r\nthat the owner of the banner claimed or used the objects depicted thereupon\r\nas personal badges. If they are to be so included some individuals must\r\nhave revelled in a multitude of badges.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulty in deciding the point very greatly depends upon the\r\ndefinition of the badge; and if we are to take the definition according to\r\nthe manner of acceptance and usage at the period when the use of badges was\r\ngreatest, then many of the earliest cannot be taken as coming within the\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nIn later Plantagenet days, badges were of considerable importance, and\r\ncertain characteristics are plainly marked. They were never worn by the\r\nowner--in the sense in which he carried his shield, or bore his crest; they\r\nwere his sign-mark indicative of ownership; they were stamped upon his\r\nbelongings in the same way in which Government property is marked with the\r\nbroad arrow, and they were worn by his servants. They were worn not only by\r\nhis retainers, but very probably were also worn more or less temporarily by\r\nadherents of his party if he were big enough to lead a party in the State.\r\nAt all times badges had very extensive decorative use.\r\n\r\nThere was never any fixed form for the badge; there was never any fixed\r\nmanner of usage. I can find no fixed laws of inheritance, no common method\r\nof assumption. In fact the use of a badge, in the days when everybody who\r\nwas anybody possessed arms, was quite subsidiary to the arms, and very much\r\nakin to the manner in which nowadays monograms are made use of. At the same\r\ntime care must be taken to distinguish the \"badge\" from the \"rebus,\" and\r\nalso from the temporary devices which we read about as having been so often\r\nadopted for the purpose of the tournament when the combatant desired his\r\nidentity to be concealed. Modern novelists and poets give us plenty of\r\nillustrations of the latter kind, but proof of the fact even that they were\r\never adopted in that form is by no means easy to find, though their\r\nprofessedly temporary nature of course militates against {455} the\r\nlikelihood of contemporary _record_. The rebus had never an heraldic\r\nstatus, and it had seldom more than a temporary existence. A fanciful\r\ndevice adopted (we hear of many such instances) for the temporary purpose\r\nof a tournament could generally be so classed, but the rebus proper has\r\nsome device, usually a pictorial rendering of the name of the person for\r\nwhom it stood. In such a category would be included printers' and masons'\r\nmarks, but probably the definition of Dr. Johnson of the word rebus, as a\r\nword represented by a picture, is as good a definition and description as\r\ncan be given. The rebus in its nature is a different thing from a badge,\r\nand may best be described as a pictorial signature, the most frequent\r\noccasion for its use being in architectural surroundings, where it was\r\nconstantly introduced as a pun upon some name which it was desired to\r\nperpetuate. The best-known and perhaps the most typical and characteristic\r\nrebus is that of Islip, the builder of part of Westminster Abbey. Here the\r\npictured punning representation of his name had nothing to do with his\r\narmorial bearings or personal badge; but the great difficulty, in dealing\r\nwith both badges and rebuses, is the difficulty of knowing which is which,\r\nfor very frequently the same or a similar device was used for both\r\npurposes. Parker, in his glossary of heraldic terms, gives several typical\r\nexamples of rebuses which very aptly illustrate their status and meaning.\r\nAt Lincoln College at Oxford, and on other buildings connected with Thomas\r\nBeckynton, Bishop of Bath and Wells, will be found carved the rebus of a\r\nbeacon issuing from a tun. This is found in conjunction with the letter T\r\nfor his Christian name, Thomas. Now this design was not his coat of arms,\r\nand was not his crest, nor was it his badge. Another rebus which is found\r\nat Canterbury shows an ox and the letters N, E, as the rebus of John Oxney.\r\nA rebus which indicates Thomas Conyston, Abbot of Cirencester, which can be\r\nfound in Gloucester Cathedral, is a comb and a tun, and the printer's mark\r\nof Richard Grifton, which is a good example of a rebus and its use, was a\r\ntree, or graft, growing on a tun. In none of these cases are the designs\r\nmentioned on any part of the arms, crest, or badge of the persons\r\nmentioned. Rebuses of this character abound on all our ancient buildings,\r\nand their use has lately come very prominently into favour in connection\r\nwith the many allusive bookplates, the design of which originates in some\r\nplay upon the name. The words \"device,\" \"ensign,\" and \"cognisance\" have no\r\ndefinite heraldic meaning, and are used impartially to apply to the crest,\r\nthe badge, and sometimes to the arms upon the shield, so that they may be\r\neliminated from consideration. There remains therefore the crest and the\r\nbadge between which to draw a definite line of distinction. The real\r\ndifference lay in the method of use, though there is usually a difference\r\nof form, {456} recognisable by an expert, but difficult to put into words.\r\nThe crest was the ornament upon the helmet, seldom if ever actually worn,\r\nand never used except by the person to whom it belonged. The badge, on the\r\nother hand, was never placed upon the helmet, but was worn by the servants\r\nand retainers, and was used right and left on the belongings of the owner\r\nas a sign of his ownership. So great and extensive at one period was the\r\nuse of these badges, that they were far more generally employed than either\r\narms or crest, and whilst the knowledge of a man's badge or badges would be\r\neveryday knowledge and common repute throughout the kingdom, few people\r\nwould know that man's crest, fewer still would ever have seen it worn.\r\n\r\nIt is merely an exaggeration of the difficulty that we are always in\r\nuncertainty whether any given device was merely a piece of decoration\r\nborrowed from the arms or crest, or whether it had continued usage as a\r\nbadge. In the same way many families who had never used crests, but who had\r\nused badges, took the opportunity of the Visitations to record their badges\r\nas crests. A notable example of the subsequent record of a badge as a crest\r\nis met with in the Stourton family. Their crest, originally a buck's head,\r\nbut after the marriage with the heiress of Le Moigne, a demi-monk, can be\r\nreadily substantiated, as can their badge of the drag or sledge. At one of\r\nthe Visitations, however, a cadet of the Stourton family recorded the\r\nsledge as a crest. Uncertainty also arises from the lack of precision in\r\nthe diction employed at all periods, the words badge, device, and crest\r\nhaving so often been used interchangeably.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty which is met with in regard to badges is that, with the\r\nexception of the extensive records of the Royal badges and some other more\r\nor less informal lists of badges of the principal personages at different\r\nperiods, badges were never a subject of official record, and whilst it is\r\ndifficult to determine the initial point as to whether any particular\r\ndevice is a badge or not, the difficulty of deducing rules concerning\r\nbadges becomes practically impossible, and after most careful consideration\r\nI have come to the conclusion that there were never any hard and fast rules\r\nrelating to badges, that they were originally and were allowed to remain\r\nmatters of personal fancy, and that although well-known cases can be found\r\nwhere the same badge has been used generation after generation, those cases\r\nmay perhaps be the exception rather than the rule. Badges should be\r\nconsidered and accepted in the general run as not being matters of\r\npermanence, and as of little importance except during the time from about\r\nthe reign of Edward III. to about the reign of Henry VIII. Their principal\r\nuse upon the clothes of the retainers came to an end by the creation of the\r\nstanding army, the beginning of which can be traced to the reign of Henry\r\nVIII., and as badges never had any ceremonial use to perpetuate {457} their\r\nstatus, their importance almost ceased altogether at that period except as\r\nregards the Royal family.\r\n\r\nSpeaking broadly, regularised and _recorded_ heraldic control as a matter\r\nof operative fact dates little if any further back than the end of the\r\nreign of Henry VIII., consequently badges originally do not appear to have\r\nbeen taken much cognisance of by the Heralds. Their actual use from that\r\nperiod onwards rapidly declined, and hence the absence of record.\r\n\r\nThough the use of badges has become very restricted, there are still one or\r\ntwo occasions on which badges are used as badges, in the style formerly in\r\nvogue. Perhaps the case which is most familiar is the broad arrow which is\r\nused to mark Government stores. It is a curious commentary upon heraldic\r\nofficialdom and its ways that though this is the only badge which has\r\nreally any extensive use, it is not a Crown badge in any degree. Although\r\nthis origin has been disputed it is said to have originated in the fact\r\nthat one of the Sydney family, when Master of the Ordnance, to prevent\r\ndisputes as to the stores for which he was responsible, marked everything\r\nwith his private badge of the broad arrow, and this private badge has since\r\nremained in constant use. One wonders at what date the officers of His\r\nMajesty will observe that this has become one of His Majesty's recognised\r\nbadges, and will include it with the other Royal badges in the warrants in\r\nwhich they are recited. Already more than two centuries have passed since\r\nit first came into use, and either they should represent to the Government\r\nthat the pheon is not a Crown mark, and that some recognised Royal badge\r\nshould be used in its place, or else they should place its status upon a\r\ndefinite footing.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of a badge used at the present day in the ancient manner\r\nis the conjoined rose, thistle, and shamrock which is embroidered front and\r\nback upon the tunics of the Beefeaters and the Yeomen of the Guard. The\r\ncrowned harps which are worn by the Royal Irish Constabulary are another\r\ninstance of the kind, but though a certain number of badges are recited in\r\nthe warrant each time any alteration or declaration of the Royal Arms\r\noccurs, their use has now become very limited. Present badges are the\r\ncrowned rose for England, the crowned thistle for Scotland, and the crowned\r\ntrefoil and the crowned harp for Ireland; whilst for the Union there is the\r\nconjoined rose, thistle, and shamrock under the crown, and the crowned\r\nshield which carries the device of the Union Jack. The badge of Wales,\r\nwhich has existed for long enough, is the uncrowned dragon upon a mount\r\nvert, and the crowned cyphers, one within and one without the Garter, are\r\nalso depicted upon the warrant. These badges, which appear on the\r\nSovereign's warrant, are never assigned to any other member of the Royal\r\nFamily, of whom {458} the Prince of Wales is the only one who rejoices in\r\nthe possession of officially assigned badges. The badge of the eldest son\r\nof the Sovereign, as such, and not as Prince of Wales, is the plume of\r\nthree ostrich feathers, enfiled with the circlet from his coronet. Recently\r\nan additional badge (on a mount vert, a dragon passant gules, charged on\r\nthe shoulder with a label of three points argent) has been assigned to His\r\nRoyal Highness. This action was taken with the desire to in some way\r\ngratify the forcibly expressed wishes of Wales, and it is probable that,\r\nthe precedent having been set, it will be assigned to all those who may\r\nbear the title of Prince of Wales in future.\r\n\r\nThe only instances I am personally aware of in which a real badge of\r\nancient origin is still worn by the servants are the cases of the state\r\nliveries of the Earl of Yarborough, whose servants wear an embroidered\r\nbuckle, and of Lord Mowbray and Stourton, whose servants wear an\r\nembroidered sledge. The family of Daubeney of Cote still bear the old\r\nDaubeney badge of the pair of bat's wings; Lord Stafford still uses his\r\n\"Stafford knot.\" I believe the servants of Lord Braye still wear the badge\r\nof the hemp-brake, and those of the Earl of Loudoun wear the Hastings\r\nmaunch; and doubtless there are a few other instances. When the old\r\nfamilies were becoming greatly reduced in number, and the nobility and the\r\nupper classes were being recruited from families of later origin, the\r\nwearing of badges, like so much else connected with heraldry, became lax in\r\nits practice.\r\n\r\nThe servants of all the great nobles in ancient days appear to have worn\r\nthe badges of their masters in a manner similar to the use of the royal\r\nbadge by the Yeomen of the Guard, although sometimes the badge was\r\nembroidered upon the sleeve; and the wearing of the badge by the retainers\r\nis the chief and principal use to which badges were anciently put. Nisbet\r\nalludes on this point to a paragraph from the Act for the Order of the\r\nRiding of Parliament in 1681, which says that \"the noblemen's lacqueys may\r\nhave over their liveries velvet coats with their badges, _i.e._ their\r\ncrests and mottoes done on plate, or embroidered on the back and breast\r\nconform to ancient custom.\" A curious survival of these plates is to be\r\nfound in the large silver plaques worn by so many bank messengers. Badges\r\nappear, however, to have been frequently depicted semé upon the lambrequins\r\nof armorial achievements, as will be seen from many of the old Garter\r\nplates; but here, again, it is not always easy to distinguish between\r\ndefinite badges and artistic decoration, nor between actual badges in use\r\nand mere appropriately selected charges from the shield.\r\n\r\nThe water-bougets of Lord Berners, the knot of Lord Stafford, popularly\r\nknown as \"the Stafford knot\"; the Harington fret; the ragged staff or the\r\nbear and the ragged staff of Lord Warwick (this {459} being really a\r\nconjunction of two separate devices); the Rose of England, the Thistle of\r\nScotland, and the sledge of Stourton, the hemp-brake of Lord Braye wherever\r\nmet with are readily recognised as badges, but there are many badges which\r\nit is difficult to distinguish from crests, and even some which in all\r\nrespects would appear to be more correctly regarded as coats of arms.\r\n\r\nIt is a point worthy of consideration whether or not a badge needs a\r\nbackground; here, again, it is a matter most difficult to determine, but it\r\nis singular that in any matter of _record_ the badge is almost invariably\r\ndepicted upon a background, either of a standard or a mantling, or upon the\r\n\"field\" of a roundel, and it may well be that their use in such\r\ncircumstances as the two cases first mentioned may have only been\r\nconsidered correct when the colour of the mantling or the standard happened\r\nto be the right colour for the background of the badge.\r\n\r\nBadges are most usually met with in stained glass upon roundels of some\r\ncolour or colours, and though one would hesitate to assert it as an actual\r\nfact, there are many instances which would lead one to suppose that the\r\nbackground of a badge was usually the livery colour or colours of its then\r\nowner, or of the family from which it was originally inherited. Certain is\r\nit that there are very few contemporary instances of badges which, when\r\nemblazoned, are not upon the known livery colours; and if this fact be\r\naccepted, then one is perhaps justified in assuming all to be livery\r\ncolours, and we get at once a ready explanation on several points which\r\nhave long puzzled antiquaries. The name of Edward \"the Black Prince\" has\r\noften been a matter of discussion, and the children's history books tell us\r\nthat the nickname originated from the colour of his armour. This may be\r\ntrue enough, but as most armour would be black when it was unpolished, and\r\nas most armour was either polished or dull, the probabilities are not very\r\ngreatly in its favour. Though there can be found instances, it was not a\r\nusual custom for any one to paint his armour red or green. Even if the\r\narmour of the prince were enamelled black it would be so usually hidden by\r\nhis surcoat that he is hardly likely to have been nicknamed from it. It\r\nseems to me far more probable that black was the livery colour of the Black\r\nPrince, and that his own retainers and followers wore the livery of black.\r\nIf that were the case, one understands at once how he would obtain the\r\nnickname. The nickname is doubtless contemporary. A curious confirmation of\r\nmy supposition is met with in the fact that his shield for peace was:\r\n\"Sable, three ostrich feathers two and one, the quill of each passing\r\nthrough a scroll argent.\" There we get the undoubted badge of the ostrich\r\nfeather, which was originally borne singly, depicted upon his livery\r\ncolour--black. {460}\r\n\r\nThe badges represented in Prince Arthur's Book in the College of Arms (an\r\nimportant source of our knowledge upon the subject) are all upon\r\nbackgrounds; and the curious divisions of the colours on the backgrounds\r\nwould seem to show that each badge had its own background, several badges\r\nbeing only met with upon the same ground when that happens to be the true\r\nbackground belonging to them. But in attempting to deduce rules, it should\r\nbe remembered that in all and every armorial matter there was greater\r\nlaxity of rule at the period of the actual use of arms as a reality of life\r\nthan it was possible to permit when the multiplication of arms as paper\r\ninsignia made regulation necessary and more restrictive; so that an\r\noccasional variation from any deduction need not necessarily vitiate the\r\nconclusion, even in a matter exclusively relating to the shield. How much\r\nmore, then, must we remain in doubt when dealing with badges which appear\r\nto have been so largely a matter of personal caprice.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking comment that of all the badges presently to be referred to\r\nof the Stafford family, each single one is depicted upon a background. It\r\nis a noticeable fact that of the eighteen \"badges\" exemplified as belonging\r\nto the family of Stafford, nine are upon parti-coloured fields. This is not\r\nan unreasonable proportion if the fields are considered to be the livery\r\ncolours of the families from whom the badges were originally derived, but\r\nit is altogether out of proportion to the number of shields in any roll of\r\narms which would have the field party per pale, or party in any other form\r\nof division. With the exception of the second badge, which is on a striped\r\nbackground of green and white, all the party backgrounds are party per\r\npale, which was the most usual way of depicting a livery in the few records\r\nwhich have come down to us of the heraldic use of livery colours, and of\r\nthe eighteen badges, no less than eight are upon a parti-coloured field of\r\nwhich the dexter is sable and the sinister gules. Scarlet and black are\r\nknown to have been the livery colours of Edward Stafford, Duke of\r\nBuckingham, who was beheaded in 1521. The arms of the town of Buckingham\r\nare on a field per pale sable and gules.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the descent of badges and the laws which govern their\r\ndescent still less is known. The answer to the question, \"How did badges\r\ndescend?\" is simple: \"Nobody knows.\" One can only hazard opinions more or\r\nless pious, of more or less value. It is distinctly a point upon which it\r\nis risky to be dogmatic, and we must wait for the development which will\r\nfollow the recent revival of the granting of standards. As cases occur for\r\ndecision precedents will be found and disclosed. Whilst the secrecy of the\r\nrecords of the College of Arms is so jealously preserved it is impossible\r\nto speak definitely at present, for an exact and comprehensive knowledge of\r\nexact and {461} authoritative instances of fact is necessary before a\r\ndecision can be definitely put forward. Unless some officer of arms will\r\ncarefully collate the information which can be gleaned from the records in\r\nthe College of Arms which are relevant to the subject, it does not seem\r\nlikely that our knowledge will advance greatly.\r\n\r\nThe grant of supporters to the Earl of Stafford, as under, is worthy of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\"To all and singular to whom these Presents shall come, John Anstis Esq^r\r\nGarter principal King of Arms, sends greeting, Whereas his late Majesty\r\nKing James the Second by Letters Patents under the Great Seal, did create\r\nHenry Stafford Howard to be Earl of Stafford, to have and hold the same to\r\nhim and the heirs males of his body; and for default thereof to John and\r\nFrancis his Brothers and the heirs males of their bodies respectively,\r\nwhereby the said Earldom is now legally vested in the right Hon^{ble}\r\nWilliam Stafford Howard Son and Heir of the said John; And in regard that\r\ny^e said Henry late Earl of Stafford omitted to take any Grant of\r\nSupporters, which the Peers of this Realm have an indisputable Right to use\r\nand bear, the right Hon^{ble} Henry Bowes Howard Earl of Berkshire Deputy\r\n(with the Royal Approbation) of his Grace Thomas Howard Duke of Norfolk\r\nEarl Marshall and Hereditary Marshall of England hath been pleased to\r\ndirect me to grant to the said right Hon^{ble} William Stafford Howard Earl\r\nof Stafford the Supporters formerly granted to y^e late Viscount Stafford,\r\nGrandfather to the said Earl; as also to order me to cause to be depicted\r\nin the Margin of my said Grant y^e Arms of Thomas of Woodstock Duke of\r\nGloucester quartered with the Arms of the said Earl of Stafford, together\r\nwith the Badges of the said Noble Family of Stafford: Now these presents\r\nWitness that according to the consent of the said Earl of Berkshire\r\nsignified under his Lordship's hand and seal I do by the Authority and\r\npower annexed to my Office hereby grant and assign to y^e said Right\r\nHonourable William Stafford Howard Earl of Stafford, the following\r\nSupporters which were heretofore borne by the late Lord Viscount Stafford,\r\nthat is to say, on the Dexter side a Lion Argent, and on the Sinister Side\r\na Swan surgiant Argent Gorged with a Ducal Coronet per Pale Gules and sable\r\nbeaked and membered of the Second; to be used and borne at all times and\r\nupon all occasions by the said Earl of Stafford and the heirs males of his\r\nbody, and such persons to whom the said Earldom shall descend according to\r\nthe Law and Practice of Arms without the let or interruption of any Person\r\nor Persons whatsoever. And in pursuance of the Warrant of the said Earl of\r\nBerkshire, The Arms of Thomas of Woodstock Duke of Gloucester, as the same\r\nare on a Plate remaining in the Chapel of S^t George within y^e Castle of\r\nWindsor, set up there for his Descendant the Duke of Buckingham {462} are\r\ndepicted in the margin, and quartered in such place and manner as the same\r\nwere formerly borne by the Staffords Dukes of Buckingham, together with\r\nEighteen badges belonging to the said most ancient and illustrious Family\r\nof Stafford, as the same are represented in a Manuscript remaining in the\r\nCollege of Arms (Fig. 674). In Witness whereof I the said Garter have\r\nhereto subscribed my Name and affixed the Seal of my Office this First Day\r\nof August Anno Domini 1720.\r\n\r\n \"JOHN ANSTIS Garter\r\n     \"Principal King of Arms.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 674.--The Stafford Badges as exemplified in 1720 to\r\nWilliam Stafford Howard, Earl of Stafford.]\r\n\r\n{463}\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to call attention to the fact that in this\r\nexemplification the Royal Arms are displayed before those of Stafford. On\r\nthe face of it, the document--as far as it relates to the badges--is no\r\nmore than a certificate or exemplification, in which case it is undoubted\r\nevidence that badges descend to the heir-general as do quarterings; but\r\nthere is the possibility that the document is a re-grant in the nature of\r\nan exemplification following a Royal Licence, or a re-grant to remove\r\nuncertainty as to the attainder. And if the document--as far as its\r\nrelation to the badges goes--has any of the character of a grant, it can\r\nhave but little value as evidence of the descent of badges. It is\r\nremarkable that it is absolutely silent as to the future destination of the\r\nbadges. The real fact is that the whole subject of the descent and\r\ndevolution of badges is shrouded in mystery. Each of the badges (Fig. 674)\r\nis depicted within a circle adorned with a succession of Stafford knots, as\r\nis shown in the one instance at the head. Five of these badges appear upon\r\na well-known portrait of Edward, Duke of Buckingham. The fact that some of\r\nthese _badges_ are really crests depicted upon wreaths goes far as an\r\nauthority for the use of a crest upon livery buttons for the purposes of a\r\nbadge.\r\n\r\nIn ancient days all records seemed to point to the fact that badges were\r\npersonal, and that though they were worn by the retainers, they were the\r\nproperty of _the head_ of the family, rather than (as the arms) of the\r\nwhole family, and though the information available is meagre to the last\r\ndegree, it would appear probable that in all cases where their use by other\r\nmembers of the family than the head of the house can be proved, the\r\nlikelihood is that the cadets would render feudal service and would wear\r\nthe badge as retainers of the man whose standard they followed into battle,\r\nso that we should expect to find the badge following the same descent as\r\nthe peerage, together with the lands and liabilities which accompanied it.\r\nThis undoubtedly makes for the inheritance of a badge upon the same line of\r\ndescent as a barony by writ, and such a method of inheritance accounts for\r\nthe known descent of most of the badges heraldically familiar to us.\r\nProbably we shall be right in so accepting it as the ancient rule of\r\ninheritance. But, on the other hand, a careful examination of the \"Book of\r\nStandards,\" now preserved in the College of Arms, provides several examples\r\ncharged with marks of cadency. But here again one is in ignorance whether\r\nthis is an admission of inheritance by cadets, or whether the cases should\r\nbe considered as grants of differenced versions to cadets. This then gives\r\nus the badge, the property in and of which would descend to the\r\nheir-general (and perhaps also to cadets), whilst it would be used (if\r\nthere were no inherited right) in token of allegiance or service, actual,\r\nquasi-actual, {464} or sentimental, by the cadets of the house and their\r\nservants; for whilst the use of the cockade is a survival of the right to\r\nbe waited on and served by a soldier servant, the use of a badge by a cadet\r\nmay be a survival and reminder of the day when (until they married\r\nheiresses and continued or founded other families) the cadets of a house\r\nowed and gave military service to the head of their own family, and in\r\nreturn were supported by him.\r\n\r\nFrom the wording of the recent grants of badges I believe the intention,\r\nhowever, is that the badge is to descend of right to all of those people on\r\nwhom a right to it would devolve if it were a quartering.\r\n\r\nThe use of badges having been so limited, the absence of rule and\r\nregulation leaves it very much a matter of personal taste how badges, where\r\nthey exist, shall be heraldically depicted, and perhaps it is better to\r\nleave their manner of display to artistic requirements. The most usual\r\nplace, when depicted in conjunction with an achievement, is on either side\r\nof the crest, and they may well be placed in that position. Where they\r\nexist, however, they ought undoubtedly to be continued in use upon the\r\nliveries of the servants, and the present practice is for them to be placed\r\non the livery buttons, and embroidered upon the epaulettes or on the\r\nsleeves of state liveries. Undoubtedly the former practice of placing the\r\nbadge upon the servants' livery is the precursor of the present vogue of\r\nplacing crests upon livery buttons, and many heraldic writers complain of\r\nthe impropriety of placing the crest in such a position. I am not sure that\r\nI myself may not have been guilty in this way; but when one bears in mind\r\nthe number of cases in which the badge and the crest are identical, and\r\nwhen, as in the above instance, devices which are undoubtedly crests are\r\nexemplified as and termed badges, even as such being represented upon\r\nwreaths, and even in that form granted upon standards, whilst in other\r\ncases the action has been the reverse, it leaves one under the necessity of\r\nbeing careful in making definite assertions.\r\n\r\nHaving dealt with the laws (if there ever were any) and the practice\r\nconcerning the use and display of badges in former days, it will be of\r\ninterest to notice some of those which were anciently in use.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the badge of the ostrich feathers, now borne\r\nexclusively by the heir-apparent to the throne. The old legend that the\r\nBlack Prince won the badge at the battle of Crecy by the capture of John,\r\nKing of Bohemia, together with the motto \"Ich dien,\" has been long since\r\nexploded. Sir Harris Nicolas brought to notice the fact that among certain\r\npieces of plate belonging to Queen Philippa of Hainault was a large\r\nsilver-gilt dish enamelled with a black escutcheon with ostrich feathers,\r\n\"vuo scuch nigro cum pennis de {465} ostrich,\" and upon the strength of\r\nthat, suggested that the ostrich feather was probably originally a badge of\r\nthe Counts of Hainault derived from the County of Ostrevaus, a title which\r\nwas held by their eldest sons. The suggestion in itself seems probable\r\nenough and may be correct, but it would not account for the use of the\r\nostrich feathers by the Mowbray family, who did not descend from the\r\nmarriage of Edward III. and Philippa of Hainault. Contemporary proof of the\r\nuse of badges is often difficult to find. The Mowbrays had many badges, and\r\ncertainly do not appear to have made any very extensive use of the ostrich\r\nfeathers. But there seems to be very definite authority for the existence\r\nof the badge. There is in one of the records of the College of Arms (R. 22,\r\n67), which is itself a copy of another record, the following statement:--\r\n\r\n\"The discent of Mowbray written at length in lattin from the Abby booke of\r\nnewborough wherein Rich 2 gaue to Thomas Duke of norff. & Erle Marshall the\r\narmes of Saint Edward Confessor in theis words:\r\n\r\n\"Et dedit eidem Thome ad pertandum in sigillo et vexillo quo arma S^{ti}\r\nEdwardi. Idcirco arma bipartata portavit scil' 't Sci Edwardi et domini\r\nmarcialis angliæ cum duabus pennis strutionis erectis et super crestam\r\nleonem et duo parva scuta cum leonibus et utraq' parto predictorum\r\narmorum.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 675.--The arms granted by King Richard II. to Thomas de\r\nMowbray, Duke of Norfolk, and showing the ostrich feather badges.]\r\n\r\nAccompanying this is a rough-tricked sketch of the arms upon which the\r\nillustration (Fig. 675) has been based. Below this extract in the College\r\nRecords is written in another hand: \"I find this then {466} in ye chancell\r\nwindow of Effingham by Bungay in the top of the cot window with Mowbraye &\r\nSegrave on the side in glass there.\"\r\n\r\nWho the writer was I am unaware. He appends a further sketch to his note,\r\nwhich slightly differs. No helmet or crest is shown, and the central shield\r\nhas only the arms of Brotherton. The feathers which flank it are both\r\nenfiled below the shield by one coronet. Of the smaller shields at the\r\nside, the dexter bears the arms of Mowbray and the sinister those of\r\nSegrave. Possibly the Mowbrays, as recognised members of the Royal Family,\r\nbore the badge by subsequent grant and authorisation and not on the simple\r\nbasis of inheritance.\r\n\r\nAn ostrich feather piercing a scroll was certainly the favourite badge of\r\nthe Black Prince and so appears on several of his seals, and triplicated it\r\noccurs on his \"shield of peace\" (Fig. 478), which, set up under the\r\ninstructions in his will, still remains on his monument in Canterbury\r\nCathedral. The arms of Sir Roger de Clarendon, the illegitimate son of the\r\nBlack Prince, were derived from this \"shield for peace,\" which I take it\r\nwas not really a coat of arms at all, but merely the badge of the Prince\r\ndepicted upon his livery colour, and which might equally have been\r\ndisplayed upon a roundle. In the form of a shield bearing three feathers\r\nthe badge occurs on the obverse of the second seal of Henry IV. in 1411. A\r\nsingle ostrich feather with the motto \"Ich dien\" upon the scroll is to be\r\nseen on the seal of Edward, Duke of York, who was killed at the battle of\r\nAgincourt in 1415. Henry IV. as Duke of Lancaster placed on either side of\r\nhis escutcheon an ostrich feather with a garter or belt carrying the motto\r\n\"Sovereygne\" _twined around_ the feather, John of Gaunt used the badge with\r\na chain laid along the quill, and Thomas, Duke of Gloucester, used it with\r\na garter and buckle instead of the chain; whilst John Beaufort, Duke of\r\nSomerset, placed an ostrich feather on each side of his shield, the quills\r\nin his case being compony argent and azure, like the bordure round his\r\narms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 676.--Seal of King James II. for the Duchy of\r\nLancaster.]\r\n\r\nThere is a note in Harl. MS. 304, folio 12, which, if it be strictly\r\naccurate, is of some importance. It is to the effect that the \"feather\r\nsilver with the pen gold is the King's, the ostrich feather pen and all\r\nsilver is the Prince's (_i.e._ the Prince of Wales), and the ostrich\r\nfeather gold the pen ermine is the Duke of Lancaster's.\" That statement\r\nevidently relates to a time when the three were in existence\r\ncontemporaneously, _i.e._ before the accession of Henry IV. In the reign of\r\nRichard II. there was no Prince of Wales. During the reign of Edward III.\r\nfrom 1376 onwards, Richard, afterwards Richard II., was Prince of Wales,\r\nand John of Gaunt was Duke of Lancaster (so cr. 1362). But John of Gaunt\r\nused the feather in the form above stated, and to find a Duke of Lancaster\r\n_before_ John of Gaunt we must go {467} back to before 1360, when we have\r\nEdward III. as King, the Black Prince as Prince, and Henry of Lancaster\r\n(father-in-law of John of Gaunt) as Duke of Lancaster. He derived from\r\nHenry III., and like the Mowbrays had no blood descent from Philippa of\r\nHainault. A curious confirmation of my suggestion that black was the livery\r\ncolour of the Black Prince is found in the fact that there was in a window\r\nin St. Dunstan's Church, London, within a wreath of roses a roundle per\r\npale sanguine and azure (these being unquestionably livery colours), a\r\nplume of ostrich feathers argent, quilled or, enfiled by a scroll bearing\r\nthe words \"Ich dien.\" Above was the Prince's coronet and the letters E. &\r\nP., one on each side of the plume. This was intended for Edward VI.,\r\ndoubtless being erected in the reign of Henry VIII. The badge in the form\r\nin which we know it, _i.e._ enfiled by the princely coronet, dates from\r\nabout the beginning of the Stuart dynasty, since when it appears to have\r\nbeen exclusively reserved for the eldest son and heir-apparent to the\r\nthrone. At the same time the right to the display of the badge would appear\r\nto have been reserved by the Sovereign, and Woodward remarks:--\r\n\r\n\"On the Privy Seals of our Sovereigns the ostrich feather is still employed\r\nas a badge. The shield of arms is usually placed between two lions sejant\r\nguardant addorsed, each holding the feather. On the Privy Seal of Henry\r\nVIII. the feathers are used without the lions, and this was the case on the\r\nmajority of the seals of the Duchy of Lancaster. On the reverse of the\r\npresent seal of the Duchy the feathers appear to be ermine.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 677.--Badge of King Henry II.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 678.--Badge of Edward IV.]\r\n\r\nFig. 676 shows the seal of James II. for the Duchy of Lancaster. The seal\r\nof the Lancashire County Council shows a shield supported by two talbots\r\nsejant addorsed, each supporting in the exterior paw an ostrich feather\r\nsemé-de-lis. It is possible that the talbots may be intended for lions and\r\nthe fleurs-de-lis for ermine spots. The silver swan, one of the badges of\r\nKing Henry V., was used also by Henry IV. It was derived from the De\r\nBohuns, Mary de Bohun being the wife of Henry IV. From the De Bohuns it has\r\nbeen traced to the Mandevilles, Earls of Essex, who may have adopted it to\r\ntypify their descent from Adam Fitz Swanne, _temp._ Conquest. Fig. 33 on\r\nthe same plate is the white hart of Richard II. Although some have traced\r\nthis badge from the white hind used as a badge by Joan, the Fair Maid of\r\nKent, the mother of Richard II., it is probably a device punning upon his\r\nname, \"Rich-hart.\" Richard II. was not the heir of his mother. The heir was\r\nhis half-brother, Thomas Holand, Earl of Kent, who _did_ use the badge of\r\nthe hind, and perhaps the real truth is that the Earl of Kent having the\r\nbetter claim to the hind, Richard was under the necessity of making an\r\nalteration which the obvious pun upon his {468} name suggested. There is no\r\ndoubt that the crest of Ireland originated therefrom. The stag in this case\r\nwas undoubtedly \"lodged\" in the earliest versions, and I have been much\r\ninterested in tracing the steps by which the springing attitude has\r\ndeveloped owing to the copying of badly drawn examples.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many Royal and other badges in this country there are some of\r\nconsiderable interest. Fig. 677 represents the famous badge of the\r\n\"broom-cod\" or \"planta genista,\" from which the name of the dynasty was\r\nderived. It appears to have been first used by King Henry II., though it\r\nfigures in the decoration of the tomb of Geoffrey, Count of Anjou.\r\n\"Peascod\" Street in Windsor of course derives its name therefrom. The\r\nwell-known badges of the white and red roses of York and Lancaster have\r\nbeen already referred to, and Fig. 678, the well-known device of the\r\n\"rose-en-soliel\" used by King Edward IV., was really a combination of two\r\ndistinct badges, viz. \"the blazing sun of York\" and the \"white rose of\r\nYork.\" The rose again appears in 679, here dimidiated with the pomegranate\r\nof Catharine of Aragon. This is taken from the famous Tournament Roll (now\r\nin the College of Arms), which relates to the Tournament, 13th and 14th of\r\nFebruary 1510, to celebrate the birth of Prince Henry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 679.--Compound Badge of Henry VIII. and Catharine of\r\nAragon. (From the Westminster Tournament Roll.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 680.--Badge of Richard I.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 681.--Two badges of Henry VII., viz. the \"sun-burst\"\r\nand the crowned portcullis.]\r\n\r\nRichard I., John, and Henry III. are all said to have used the device of\r\nthe crescent and star (Fig. 680). Henry VII. is best known by his two\r\nbadges of the crowned portcullis and the \"sun-burst\" (Fig. 681). The\r\nsuggested origin of the former, that it was a pun on the name Tudor (_i.e._\r\ntwo-door) is confirmed by the motto \"Altera securitas\" which was used with\r\nit, but at the same time is rather vitiated by the fact that it was also\r\nused by the Beauforts, who had {469} no Tudor descent. Save a very\r\ntentative remark hazarded by Woodward, no explanation has as yet been\r\nsuggested for the sun-burst. My own strong conviction, based on the fact\r\nthat this particular badge was principally used by Henry VII., who was\r\nalways known as Henry of Windsor, is that it is nothing more than an\r\nattempt to pictorially represent the name \"Windsor\" by depicting \"winds\" of\r\n\"or.\" The badge is also attributed to Edward III., and he, like Henry VII.,\r\nmade his principal residence at Windsor. Edward IV. also used the white\r\nlion of March (whence is derived the shield of Ludlow: \"Azure, a lion\r\ncouchant guardant, between three roses argent,\" Ludlow being one of the\r\nfortified towns in the Welsh Marches), and the black bull which, though\r\noften termed \"of Clarence,\" is generally associated with the Duchy of\r\nCornwall. Richard III., as Duke of Gloucester, used a white boar.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Northumberland used a silver crescent; the Earl of Douglas, a\r\nred hart; the Earl of Pembroke, a golden pack-horse with collar and traces;\r\nLord Hastings bore as badge a black bull's head erased, gorged with a\r\ncoronet; Lord Stanley, a golden griffin's leg, erased; Lord Howard, a white\r\nlion charged on the shoulder with a blue crescent; Sir Richard Dunstable\r\nadopted a white cock as a badge; Sir John Savage, a silver unicorn's head\r\nerased; Sir Simon Montford, a golden lily; Sir William Gresham, a green\r\ngrasshopper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 682.--Badge of the Duke of Suffolk.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 683.--Badge of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 684.--Stafford Knot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 685.--Wake or Ormonde Knot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 686.--Bourchier Knot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 687.--Heneage Knot.]\r\n\r\nTwo curious badges are to be seen in Figs. 682 and 683. The former is an\r\nape's clog argent, chained or, and was used by William de la Pole, Duke of\r\nSuffolk (d. 1450). Fig. 683, \"a salet silver\" (MS. Coll. of Arms, 2nd M.\r\n16), is the badge of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk (d. 1524). Various\r\nfamilies used knots of different design, of which the best known is the\r\nStafford knot (Fig. 684). The wholesale and improper appropriation of this\r\nbadge with a territorial application has unfortunately caused it to be very\r\ngenerally referred to as a \"Staffordshire\" knot, and that it was the\r\npersonal badge of the Lords Stafford is too often overlooked. Other badge\r\nknots are the Wake or Ormonde knot (Fig. 685), the Bourchier knot (Fig.\r\n686), and the Heneage knot (Fig. 687).\r\n\r\n{470}\r\n\r\nThe personal badges of the members of the Royal Family continued in use\r\nuntil the reign of Queen Anne, but from that time forward the Royal badges\r\nobtained a territorial character; the rose of England, the thistle of\r\nScotland, and the shamrock of Ireland. To these popular consent has added\r\nthe lotus-flower for India, the maple for Canada, and in a lesser degree\r\nthe wattle or mimosa for Australia; but at present these lack any official\r\nconfirmation. The two first named, nevertheless, figured on the Coronation\r\nInvitation Cards. {471}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nHERALDIC FLAGS, BANNERS, AND STANDARDS\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the display of flags, the British-born individual usually\r\nmakes a hash of the whole business, and flies either the Sovereign's\r\npersonal coat of arms, which really should only be made use of over a\r\nresidence of the Sovereign when the Sovereign is actually there, or flown\r\nat sea when the Sovereign is on board; or else he uses the national flag,\r\ncolloquially termed the \"Union Jack,\" which, strictly speaking, and as a\r\nmatter of law, ought never to be made use of on land except over the\r\nresidence of the Sovereign in his absence, or on a fortress or other\r\nGovernment building. But recently an official answer has been given in\r\nParliament, declaring what is presumably the pleasure of His Majesty to the\r\neffect that the Union Jack is the National Flag, and may be flown as such\r\non land by any British subject. If this is the intention of the Crown, it\r\nis a pity that this permission has not been embodied in a Royal warrant.\r\n\r\nThe banner of St. George, which is a white flag with a plain red cross of\r\nSt. George throughout, is now appropriated to the Order of the Garter, of\r\nwhich St. George is the patron saint, though I am by no means inclined to\r\nassert that it would be incorrect to make use of it upon a church which\r\nhappened to be specifically placed under the patronage of St. George.\r\n\r\nThe white ensign, which is a white flag bearing the cross of St. George and\r\nin the upper quarter next to the staff a reproduction of the Union device,\r\nbelongs to the Royal Navy, and certain privileged individuals to whom the\r\nright has been given by a specific warrant. The blue ensign, which is a\r\nplain blue flag with the Union device on a canton in the upper corner next\r\nthe staff, belongs to the Royal Naval Reserve; and the red ensign, which is\r\nthe same as the former, except that a red flag is substituted for the blue\r\none, belongs to the ships of the merchant service. These three flags have\r\nbeen specifically called into being by specific warrants for certain\r\npurposes which are stated in these warrants, and these purposes being\r\nwholly connected with the sea, neither the blue, the red, nor the white\r\nensign ought to be hoisted on land by anybody. Of course there is no\r\npenalty for doing so on {472} land, though very drastic penalties can be\r\nenforced for misuse of these ensigns on the water, a step which is taken\r\nfrequently enough. For a private person to use any one of these three flags\r\non land for a private purpose, the only analogy which I can suggest to\r\nbring home to people the absurdity of such action would be to instance a\r\nprivate person for his own private pleasure adopting the exact uniform of\r\nsome regiment whenever he might feel inclined to go bathing in the sea. If\r\nhe were to do so, he would find under the recent Act that he had incurred\r\nthe penalty, which would be promptly enforced, for bringing His Majesty's\r\nuniform into disrepute. It is much to be wished that the penalties exacted\r\nfor the wrongful display of these flags at sea should be extended to their\r\nabuse on shore.\r\n\r\nThe development of the Union Jack and the warrants relating to it are dealt\r\nwith herein by the Rev. J. R. Crawford, M.A., in a subsequent chapter, and\r\nI do not propose to further deal with the point, except to draw attention\r\nto a proposal, which is very often mooted, that some change or addition to\r\nthe Union Jack should be made to typify the inclusion of the colonies.\r\n\r\nBut to begin with, what is the Union Jack? Probably most would be inclined\r\nto answer, \"The flag of the Empire.\" It is nothing of the kind. It is in a\r\nway stretching the definition to describe it as the King's flag. Certainly\r\nthe design of interlaced crosses is a badge of the King's, but that badge\r\nis of a later origin than the flag.\r\n\r\nThe flag itself is the fighting emblem of the Sovereign, which the\r\nSovereign has declared shall be used by his soldiers or sailors for\r\nfighting purposes under certain specified circumstances. That it is used,\r\neven officially, in all sorts of circumstances with which the King's\r\nwarrants are not concerned is beside the matter, for it is to the Royal\r\nWarrants that one must refer for the theory of the thing.\r\n\r\nNow let us go further back, and trace the \"argent, a cross gules,\" the part\r\nwhich is England's contribution to the Union Jack, which itself is a\r\ncombination of the \"crosses\" of St. George, St. Andrew, and St. Patrick.\r\nThe theory of one is the theory of the three, separately or conjoined.\r\n\r\n\"Argent, a cross gules\" was never the coat of arms of England (except under\r\nthe Commonwealth, when its use for armorial purposes may certainly be\r\ndisregarded), and the reason it came to be regarded as the flag of England\r\nis simply and solely because fighting was always done under the supposed\r\npatronage of some saint, and England fought, _not_ under the arms of\r\nEngland, but under the flag of St. George, the patron saint of England and\r\nof the Order of the Garter. The battle-cry \"St. George for Merrie England!\"\r\nis too well known to need more than the passing mention. Scotland fought\r\nunder St. Andrew; Ireland, by a similar analogy, had for its patron saint\r\nSt. Patrick (if {473} indeed there was a Cross of St. Patrick before one\r\nwas needed for the Union flag, which is a very doubtful point), and the\r\nUnion Jack was not the combination of three territorial flags, but the\r\ncombination of the recognised emblems of the three recognised saints, and\r\nthough England claimed the sovereignty of France, and for that reason\r\nquartered the arms of France, no Englishman bothered about the patronage of\r\nSt. Denis, and the emblem of St. Denis was never flown in this country. The\r\nfact that no change was ever made in the flag to typify Hanover, whilst\r\nHanover duly had its place upon the arms, proves that the flag was\r\nrecognised to be, and allowed to remain, the emblem of the three patron\r\nsaints under whose patronage the British fought, and not the badge of any\r\nsovereignty or territorial area. If the colonies had already any saint of\r\ntheir own under whose patronage they had fought in bygone days, or in whose\r\nname they wished to fight in the future, there might be reason _for\r\nincluding the emblem of that saint_ upon the fighting flag of the Empire;\r\nbut they have no recognised saintly patrons, and they may just as well\r\nfight for our saints as choose others for themselves at so late a day; but\r\nhaving a flag which is a _combination_ of the emblems of three saints, and\r\nwhich contains nothing that is not a part of those emblems, to make any\r\naddition heraldic or otherwise to it now would, in my opinion, be best\r\nexpressed by the following illustration. Imagine three soldiers in full and\r\ncomplete uniform, one English, one Scottish, and one Irish, it being\r\ndesired to evolve a uniform that should be taken from all three for use by\r\na Union regiment. A tunic from one, trousers from another, and a helmet\r\nfrom a third, might be blended into a very effective and harmonious\r\ncomposite uniform. Following the analogy of putting a bordure, which is not\r\nthe emblem of a saint, round the recognised emblems of the three recognised\r\nsaints, and considering it to be in keeping because the bordure was\r\nheraldic and the emblems heraldic, one might argue, that because a uniform\r\nwas clothing as was also a ballet-dancer's skirt, therefore a\r\nballet-dancer's skirt outside the whole would be in keeping with the rest\r\nof the uniform. For myself I should dislike any addition to the Union\r\ndevice, as much as we should deride the donning of tulle skirts outside\r\ntheir tunics and trousers by the brigade of Guards.\r\n\r\nThe flag which should float from a church tower should have no more on it\r\nthan the recognised ecclesiastical emblems of the saint to whom it is\r\ndedicated: the keys of St. Peter, the wheel of St. Catherine, the sword of\r\nSt. Paul, the cross and martlets of St. Edmund, the lily of St. Mary, the\r\nemblem of the Holy Trinity, or whatever the emblem may be of the saint in\r\nquestion. (The alternative for a church is the banner of St. George, the\r\npatron saint of the realm.) The flags upon public buildings should bear the\r\narms of the corporate bodies to whom those {474} buildings belong. The flag\r\nto be flown by a private person, as the law now stands, should bear that\r\nperson's private arms, if he has any, and if he has not he should be\r\ncontent to forego the pleasures arising from the use of bunting. A private\r\nflag should be double its height in length. The entire surface should be\r\noccupied by the coat of arms.\r\n\r\nThese flags of arms are _banners_, and it is quite a misnomer to term the\r\nbanner of the Royal Arms the Royal Standard. The flags of arms hung over\r\nthe stalls of the Knights of the Garter, St. Patrick, and the former\r\nKnights of the Bath are properly, and are always termed _banners_. The term\r\n_standard_ properly refers to the long tapering flag used in battle, and\r\nunder which an overlord mustered his retainers in battle. This did _not_\r\ndisplay his armorial bearings. Next to the staff usually came the cross of\r\nSt. George, which was depicted, of course, on a white field. This occupied\r\nrather less than one-third of the standard. The remainder of the standard\r\nwas of the colour or colours of the livery, and thereupon was represented\r\nall sorts of devices, usually the badges and sometimes the crest. The motto\r\nwas usually on transverse bands, which frequently divided the standard into\r\ncompartments for the different badges. These mottoes from their nature are\r\n_not_ war-cries, but undoubtedly relate and belong to the badges with which\r\nthey appear in conjunction. The whole banner was usually fringed with the\r\nlivery colours, giving the effect of a bordure compony. The use of\r\nstandards does not seem, except for the ceremonial purposes of funerals, to\r\nhave survived the Tudor period, this doubtless being the result of the\r\ncreation of the standing army in the reign of Henry VIII. The few exotic\r\nstandards, _e.g._, remaining from the Jacobite rebellion, seldom conform to\r\nthe old patterns, but although the shape is altered, the artistic character\r\nlargely remains in the regimental colours of the present day with their\r\nassorted regimental badges and scrolls with the names of battle honours.\r\n\r\nWith the recent revival of the granting of badges the standard has again\r\nbeen brought into use as the vehicle to carry the badge (Plate VIII.). The\r\narms are now placed next the staff, and upon the rest of the field the\r\nbadge is repeated or alternated with the crest. Badges and standards are\r\nnow granted to any person already possessing a right to arms and willing to\r\npay the necessary fees.\r\n\r\nPLATE VIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe armorial use of the banner in connection with the display of heraldic\r\nachievements is very limited in this country. In the case of the Marquess\r\nof Dufferin and Ava the banner or flag is an integral and unchangeable part\r\nof the heraldic supporters, and in Ross-of-Bladensburg, _e.g._, it is\r\nsimilarly an integral part of the crest. In the warrant of augmentation\r\ngranted to H.M. Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain on her marriage, banners of\r\nthe Royal Arms of {475} England were placed in the paws of her supporters.\r\nOther cases where arms have been depicted on banners are generally no more\r\nthan matters of artistic design; but in the arms of Scotland as\r\nmatriculated in Lyon Register for King Charles II. the supporters are\r\naccompanied by banners, the dexter being of the arms of Scotland, and the\r\nsinister the banner of St. Andrew. These banners possess rather a different\r\ncharacter, and approach very closely to the German use. The same practice\r\nhas been followed in the seals of the Duchy of Lancaster, inasmuch as on\r\nthe obverse of the seal of George IV. and the seal of Queen Victoria the\r\nRoyal supporters hold banners of the arms of England and of the Duchy\r\n(_i.e._ England, a label for difference). James I. on his Great Seal had\r\nthe banners of Cadwallader (azure, a cross patté fitché or) and King Edgar\r\n(azure, a cross patonce between four martlets or), and on the Great Seal of\r\nCharles I. the dexter supporter holds a banner of St. George, and the\r\nsinister a banner of St. Andrew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 688.--\"Middle\" arms of the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg.\r\n(From Ströhl's _Deutsche Wappenrolle_.)]\r\n\r\nOf the heraldic use of the banner in Germany Ströhl writes:--\r\n\r\n\"The banner appears in a coat of arms, either in the hands or paws of the\r\nsupporters (Fig. 688), also set up behind the shield, or the pavilion, as,\r\nfor instance, in the larger achievement of his Majesty the German Emperor,\r\nin the large achievement of the kingdom of Prussia, of the dukedom of\r\nSaxe-Altenburg, and further in the Arms of State of Italy, Russia,\r\nRoumania, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Banners on the shield as charges, or on the helmet as a crest, are here,\r\nof course, not in question, but only those banners which serve as\r\n_Prachtstücke_ (appendages of magnificence).\r\n\r\n\"The banners of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are long and narrow,\r\nand frequently run in stripes, like battlements. However, in {476} the\r\nsecond half of the thirteenth century flags were also to be met with, with\r\nthe longer side attached to the stick. Later on the banners became more\r\nsquare, and show on the top a long strip, generally of another colour, the\r\n_Schwenkel_ (_i.e._ something that flourishes), waves to and fro. To bear a\r\nred _Schwenkel_ was a special privilege, similar to the right of sealing\r\nwith red wax.\r\n\r\n\"The ecclesiastical banner has three points, and is provided with rings on\r\nthe top in order that it may be fastened to the stick by them, in an\r\noblique position.\r\n\r\n\"The banner always represents the field of the shield, and assumes\r\naccordingly its tincture. The charges of the shield should be placed upon\r\nthe banner without the outline of a shield, and the edge against the\r\nflag-staff is considered the dexter; it follows from this that the figure\r\nmust be turned towards it.\r\n\r\n\"For instance, if the shield bear the following arms, argent an eagle\r\ngules, the same figure, suited to the size of the flag, appears on the\r\nbanner, with its head turned towards the staff. If it be wished to\r\nrepresent only the _colours_ of the arms upon the flag, that of the charge\r\nis placed above, and that of the field below. Thus, for example, the\r\nPrussian flag is black and white, corresponding to the black eagle on the\r\nsilver field; the flag of Hohenzollern is white and black, corresponding to\r\ntheir coat of arms, quartered silver and black, because in the latter case,\r\nso soon as a heraldic representation is available, from the position of the\r\ncoloured fields, the correct order of the tinctures is determined.\" {477}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nMARKS OF CADENCY\r\n\r\nThe manner in which cadency is indicated in heraldic emblazonment forms one\r\nof the most important parts of British armory, but our own intricate and\r\nminutely detailed systems are a purely British development of armory. I do\r\nnot intend by the foregoing remark to assert that the occasional use, or\r\neven, as in some cases, the constant use of altered arms for purposes of\r\nindicating cadency is unknown on the Continent, because different branches\r\nof one family are constantly found using, for the purposes of distinction,\r\nvariations of the arms appertaining to the head of their house; in France\r\nespecially the bordure has been extensively used, but the fact nevertheless\r\nremains that in no other countries is there found an organised system or\r\nset of rules for the purpose. Nor is this idea of the indication of cadency\r\nwholly a modern development, though some, in fact most, of the rules\r\npresently in force are no doubt a result of modern requirements, and do not\r\ndate back to the earliest periods of heraldry in this country.\r\n\r\nThe obligation of cadet lines to difference their arms was recognised\r\npractically universally in the fourteenth century; and when, later, the\r\nsystematic use of differencing seemed in danger of being ignored, it was\r\nmade the subject of specific legislation. In the treatise of ZYPOEUS, _de\r\nNotitia juris Belgici_, lib. xii., quoted also in MENETRIER, _Recherches du\r\nBlazon_, p. 218, we find the following:--\r\n\r\n\"Ut secundo et ulterius geniti, quinimo primogeniti vivo patre, integra\r\ninsignia non gerant, sed aliqua nota distincta, ut perpetuo linæ dignosci\r\npossint, et ex qua quique descendant, donec anteriores defecerint. Exceptis\r\nLuxenburgis et Gueldris, quibus non sunt ii mores.\" (The exception is\r\ncurious.)\r\n\r\nThe choice of these _brisures_, as marks of difference are often termed,\r\nwas, however, left to the persons concerned; and there is, consequently, a\r\ngreat variety of differences or differentiation marks which seem to have\r\nbeen used for the purpose. The term \"brisure\" is really French, whilst the\r\nGerman term for these marks is \"Beizeichen.\"\r\n\r\nBritish heraldry, on the contrary, is remarkable for its use of two {478}\r\ndistinct sets of rules--the English and the Scottish--the Irish system\r\nbeing identical with the former.\r\n\r\nTo understand the question of cadency it is necessary to revert to the\r\nstatus of a coat of arms in early periods. In the first chapter we dealt\r\nwith the origin of armory; and in a subsequent chapter with the status of a\r\ncoat of arms in Great Britain, and it will therefrom have been apparent\r\nthat arms, and a right to them, developed in this country as an adjunct of,\r\nor contemporaneously with, the extension of the feudal system. Every\r\nlandowner was at one time required to have his seal--presumably, of\r\narms--and as a result arms were naturally then considered to possess\r\nsomething of a territorial character. I do not by this mean to say that the\r\narms belonged to the land and were transferable with the sale and purchase\r\nthereof. There never was in this country a period at which such an idea\r\nheld; nor were arms originally entirely personal or individual. They\r\nbelonged rather to a position half-way between the two. They were the arms\r\nof a given family, originating because that family held land and accepted\r\nthe consequent responsibilities thereto belonging, but the arms appertained\r\nfor the time being to the member of that family who owned the land, and\r\nthat this is the true idea of the former status of a coat of arms is\r\nperhaps best evidenced by the Grey and Hastings controversy, which engaged\r\nthe attention of the Court of Chivalry for several years prior to 1410. The\r\ndecision and judgment in the case gave the undifferenced arms of Hastings\r\nto the heir-general (Grey de Ruthyn), the heir-male (Sir Edward Hastings)\r\nbeing found only capable of bearing the arms of Hastings subject to some\r\nmark of difference.\r\n\r\nThis case, and the case of Scrope and Grosvenor, in which the king's award\r\nwas that the bordure was not sufficient difference for a stranger in blood,\r\nbeing only the mark of a cadet, show clearly that the status of a coat of\r\narms in early times was that in its undifferenced state it belonged to one\r\nperson only for the time being, and that person the head of the family,\r\nthough it should be noted that the term \"Head of the Family\" seems to have\r\nbeen interpreted into the one who held the lands of the family--whether he\r\nwere heir-male or heir-general being apparently immaterial.\r\n\r\nThis much being recognised, it follows that some means were needed to be\r\ndevised to differentiate the armorial bearings of the younger members of\r\nthe family. Of course the earliest definite instances of any attempt at a\r\nsystematic \"differencing\" for cadency which can be referred to are\r\nundoubtedly those cases presented by the arms of the younger members of the\r\nRoyal Family in England. These cases, however, it is impossible to take as\r\nprecedents. Royal Arms have always, from the very earliest times, been a\r\nlaw unto themselves, {479} subject only to the will of the Sovereign, and\r\nit is neither safe nor correct to deduce precedents to be applied to the\r\narms of subjects from proved instances concerning the Royal Arms.\r\n\r\nProbably, apart from these, the earliest mark of cadency which is to be met\r\nwith in heraldry is the label (Fig. 689) used to indicate the eldest son,\r\nand this mark of difference dates back far beyond any other regularised\r\nmethods applicable to \"younger\" sons. The German name for the label is\r\n\"Turnierkragen,\" _i.e._ Tournament Collar, which may indicate the origin of\r\nthis curious figure. Probably the use of the label can be taken back to the\r\nmiddle or early part of the thirteenth century, but the opportunity and\r\nnecessity of marking the arms of the heir-apparent temporarily, he having\r\nthe expectation of eventually succeeding to the undifferenced arms, is a\r\nvery different matter to the other opportunities for the use of marks of\r\ncadency. The lord and his heir were the two most important members of the\r\nfamily, and all others sunk their identity in their position in the\r\nhousehold of their chief unless they were established by marriage, or\r\notherwise, in lordships of their own, in which cases they are usually found\r\nto have preferred the arms of the family from whom they inherited the\r\nlordships they enjoyed; and their identities being to such a large extent\r\noverlooked, the necessity for any system of marking the arms of a younger\r\nson was not so early apparent as the necessity for marking the arms of the\r\nheir.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 689.--The label.]\r\n\r\nThe label does not appear to have been originally confined exclusively to\r\nthe heir. It was at first the only method of differencing known, and it is\r\nnot therefore to be wondered at that we find that it was frequently used by\r\nother cadets, who used it with no other meaning than to indicate that they\r\nwere not the Head of the House. It has, consequently, in some few cases\r\n[for example, in the arms of Courtenay (Fig. 246), Babington, and\r\nBarrington] become stereotyped as a charge, and is continuously and\r\nunchangeably used as such, whereas doubtless it may have been no more\r\noriginally than a mere mark of cadency. The label was originally drawn with\r\nits upper edge identical with the top of the shield (Fig. 520), but later\r\nits position on the shield was lowered. The number of points on the label\r\nwas at first without meaning, a five-pointed label occurring in Fig. 690\r\nand a seven-pointed one in Fig. 235.\r\n\r\nIn the Roll of Caerlaverock the label is repeatedly referred to. Of Sir\r\nMAURICE DE BERKELEY it is expressly declared that\r\n\r\n \"... un label de asur avoit,\r\n  Porce qe ces peres vivoit.\"\r\n\r\n{480}\r\n\r\nSir PATRICK DUNBAR, son of the Earl of LOTHIAN (_i.e._ of MARCH), then bore\r\narms similar to his father, with the addition of a label \"azure.\" On the\r\nother hand, Sir JOHN DE SEGRAVE is said to bear his deceased father's arms\r\nundifferenced, while his younger brother NICHOLAS carries them with a label\r\n\"gules\"; and in the case of EDMUND DE HASTINGS the label is also assigned\r\nto a younger brother. Further proof of its being thus borne by cadets is\r\nfurnished by the evidence in the GREY and HASTINGS controversy in the reign\r\nof HENRY IV., from which it appeared that the younger line of the HASTINGS\r\nfamily had for generations differenced the paternal coat by a label of\r\nthree points; and, as various knights and esquires had deposed to this\r\nlabel being the cognisance of the nearest heir, it was argued that the\r\ndefendant's ancestors would not have borne their arms in this way had they\r\nnot been the reputed next heirs of the family of the Earl of PEMBROKE. The\r\nlabel will be seen in Figs. 690, 691, and 692, though its occurrence in the\r\nlast case in each of the quarters is most unusual. The argent label on the\r\narms for the Sovereignty of Man is a curious confirmation of the\r\nreservation of an argent label for Royalty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 690.--Arms of John de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln (d. 1240):\r\nQuarterly, or and gules, a bend sable, and a label argent. (MS. Cott. Nero,\r\nD. 1.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 691.--Arms of John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln (son of\r\nJohn, Duke of Suffolk), d. 1487: Quarterly, 1 and 4, azure, a fess between\r\nthree leopards' faces or; 2 and 3, per fess gules and argent, a lion\r\nrampant queue fourché or, armed and langued azure, over all a label argent.\r\n(From his seal.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 692.--Arms of William Le Scrope, Earl of Wiltes (d.\r\n1399): Quarterly, 1 and 4, the arms of the Isle of Man, a label argent; 2\r\nand 3, azure, a bend or, a label gules. (From Willement's Roll, sixteenth\r\ncentury.)]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM RUTHVEN, Provost of PERTH, eldest son of the Master of RUTHVEN,\r\nbore a label of four points in 1503. Two other instances may be noticed of\r\na label borne by a powerful younger brother. One is WALTER STEWART, Earl of\r\nMENTEITH, the fourth High Steward, in 1292; and we find the label again on\r\nthe seal of his son ALEXANDER STEWART, Earl of MENTEITH.\r\n\r\nAt Caerlaverock, HENRY of Lancaster, brother and successor of THOMAS, Earl\r\nof LANCASTER--\r\n\r\n \"Portait les armes son frère\r\n  Au beau bastoun sans label,\"\r\n\r\n_i.e._ he bore the Royal Arms, differenced by a bendlet \"azure.\" {481}\r\n\r\nJANE FENTOUN, daughter and heir-apparent of WALTER FENTOUN of Baikie, bore\r\na label in 1448, and dropped it after her father's death. This is\r\napparently an instance quite unique. I know of no other case where the\r\nlabel has been used by a woman as a mark of difference.\r\n\r\nIn FRANCE the label was the chief recognised mode of difference, though the\r\nbend and the bordure are frequently to be met with.\r\n\r\nIn GERMANY, SPENER tells us that the use of the label, though occasional,\r\nwas not infrequent: \"Sicuti in Gallia vix alius discerniculorum modus\r\nfrequentior est, ita rariora exempla reperimus in Germania,\" and he gives a\r\nfew examples, though he is unable to assign the reason for its assumption\r\nas a hereditary bearing. The most usual method of differencing in Germany\r\nwas by the alteration of the tinctures or by the alteration of the charges.\r\nAs an example of the former method, the arms of the Bavarian family of\r\nParteneck may be instanced (Figs. 693 to 697), all representing the arms of\r\ndifferent branches of the same family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 693.--Parteneck.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 694.--Cammer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 695.--Cammerberg.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 696.--Hilgertshauser.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 697.--Massenhauser.]\r\n\r\nNext to the use of the label in British heraldry came the use of the\r\nbordure, and the latter as a mark of cadency can at any rate be traced back\r\n_as a well-established matter of rule_ and precedent as far as the Scrope\r\nand Grosvenor controversy in the closing years of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nAt the period when the bordure as a difference is to be most frequently met\r\nwith in English heraldry, it never had any more definite status or meaning\r\nthan a sign that the bearer was _not_ the head of the house, though one\r\ncannot but think that in many cases in which it occurs its significance is\r\na doubt as to legitimate descent, or a doubt of the probability of an\r\nasserted descent. In modern _English_ practice the bordure as a difference\r\nfor cadets only continues to be used by those whose ancestors bore it in\r\nancient times. Its other use as a modern mark of illegitimacy is dealt with\r\nin the chapter upon marks of illegitimacy, but the curious and unique\r\n_Scottish_ system of cadency bordures will be presently referred to.\r\n\r\nIn Germany of old the use of the bordure as a difference does not appear to\r\nhave been very frequent, but it is now used to distinguish {482} the arms\r\nof the Crown Prince. In Italian heraldry, although differences are known,\r\nthere is no system whatever. In Spain and Portugal marks of cadency, in our\r\nsense of the word, are almost unknown, but nevertheless the bordure,\r\nespecially as indicating descent from a maternal ancestor, is very largely\r\nemployed. The most familiar instance is afforded by the Royal Arms of\r\nPortugal, in which the arms of PORTUGAL are surrounded by a \"bordure\" of\r\nCASTILE.\r\n\r\nDifferencing, however, had become a necessity at an earlier period than the\r\nperiod at which we find an approach to the systematic usage of the label,\r\nbordure, and bend, but it should be noticed that those who wished, and\r\nneeded, to difference were those younger members of the family who by\r\nsettlement, or marriage, had themselves become lords of other estates, and\r\nheads of distinct houses. For a man must be taken as a \"Head of a House\"\r\nfor all intents and purposes as soon as by his possession of lands \"held in\r\nchief\" he became _himself_ liable to the Crown to provide stated military\r\nservice, and as a consequence found the necessity for a banner of arms,\r\nunder which his men could be mustered. Now having these positions as\r\noverlords, the inducement was rather to set up arms for themselves than to\r\npose merely as cadets of other families, and there can be no doubt whatever\r\nthat at the earliest period, differencing, for the above reason, took the\r\nform of and was meant as a _change in the arms_. It was something quite\r\nbeyond and apart from the mere condition of a right to recognised arms,\r\nwith an indication thereupon that the bearer was not the person chiefly\r\nentitled to the display of that particular coat. We therefore find cadets\r\nbearing the arms of their house with the tincture changed, with subsidiary\r\ncharges introduced, or with some similar radical alteration made. Such\r\ncoats should properly be considered essentially _different_ coats, merely\r\n_indicating_ in their design a given relationship rather than as the _same_\r\ncoat regularly differenced by rule to indicate cadency. For instance, the\r\nthree original branches of the Conyers family bear: \"Azure, a maunch\r\nermine; azure, a maunch or; azure, a maunch ermine debruised by a bendlet\r\ngules.\" The coat differenced by the bend, of course, stands self-confessed\r\nas a differenced coat, but it is by no means certain, nor is it known\r\nwhether \"azure, a maunch ermine,\" or \"azure, a maunch or\" indicates the\r\noriginal Conyers arms, for the very simple reason that it is now impossible\r\nto definitely prove which branch supplies the true head of the family. It\r\nis known that a wicked uncle intervened, and usurped the estates to the\r\ndetriment of the nephew and heir, but whether the uncle usurped the arms\r\nwith the estates, or whether the heir changed his arms when settled on the\r\nother lands to which he migrated, there is now no means of ascertaining.\r\n\r\nSimilarly we find the Darcy arms [\"Argent, three cinquefoils gules,\" {483}\r\nwhich is probably the oldest form], \"Argent, crusuly and three cinquefoils\r\ngules,\" and \"Azure, crusuly and three cinquefoils argent,\" and countless\r\ninstances can be referred to where, for the purpose of indicating cadency,\r\nthe arms of a family were changed in this manner. This reason, of which\r\nthere can be no doubt, supplies the origin and the excuse for the custom of\r\nassigning _similar_ arms when the descent is but doubtful. Similarity\r\noriginally, though it _may_ indicate consanguinity, was never intended to\r\nbe proof thereof.\r\n\r\nThe principal ancient methods of alteration in arms, which nowadays are\r\napparently accepted as former modes of differencing merely to indicate\r\ncadency, may perhaps be classified into: (_a_) Change of tincture; (_b_)\r\nthe addition of small charges to the field, or to an ordinary; (_c_) the\r\naddition of a label or (_d_) of a canton or quarter; (_e_) the addition of\r\nan inescutcheon; (_f_) the addition (or change) of an ordinary; (_g_) the\r\nchanging of the lines of partition enclosing an ordinary, and perhaps also\r\n(_h_) diminishing the number of charges; (_i_) a change of some or all of\r\nthe minor charges. At a later date came (_j_) the systematic use of the\r\nlabel, the bordure, and the bend; and subsequently (_k_) the use of the\r\nmodern systems of \"marks of cadency.\" Perhaps, also, one should include\r\n(_l_) the addition of quarterings, the use of (_m_) augmentations and\r\nofficial arms, and (_n_) the escutcheon _en surtout_, indicating a\r\nterritorial and titular lordship, but the three last-mentioned, though\r\nuseful for distinction and frequently obviating the necessity of other\r\nmarks of cadency, did not originate with the theory or necessities of\r\ndifferencing, and are not properly marks of cadency. At the same time, the\r\nwarning should be given that it is not safe always to presume cadency when\r\na change of tincture or other slight deviation from an earlier form of the\r\narms is met with. Many families when they exhibited their arms at the\r\nVisitations could not substantiate them, and the heralds, in confirming\r\narms, frequently deliberately changed the tinctures of many coats they met\r\nwith, to introduce distinction from other authorised arms.\r\n\r\nPractically contemporarily with the use of the bordure came the use of the\r\nbend, then employed for the same purpose. In the _Armorial de Gelre_, one\r\nof the earliest armorials now in existence which can be referred to, the\r\nwell-known coat of Abernethy is there differenced by the bendlet engrailed,\r\nand the arms of the King of Navarre bear his quartering of France\r\ndifferenced by a bendlet compony. Amongst other instances in which the bend\r\nor bendlet appears originally as a mark of cadency, but now as a charge,\r\nmay be mentioned the arms of Fitzherbert, Fulton, Stewart (Earl of\r\nGalloway), and others. It is a safe presumption with regard to ancient\r\ncoats of arms that any coat in which the field is semé is in nine cases out\r\nof ten a differenced coat {484} for a junior cadet, as is also any coat in\r\nwhich a charge or ordinary is debruised by another. Of course in more\r\nmodern times no such presumption is permissible. An instance of a semé\r\nfield for cadency will be found in the case of the D'Arcy arms already\r\nmentioned. Little would be gained by a long list of instances of such\r\ndifferences, because the most careful and systematic investigations clearly\r\nshow that in early times no definite rules whatever existed as to the\r\nassumption of differences, which largely depended upon the pleasure of the\r\nbearer, and no system can be deduced which can be used to decide that the\r\nappearance of any given difference or kind of difference meant a given set\r\nof circumstances. Nor can any system be deduced which has any value for the\r\npurposes of precedent.\r\n\r\nCertain instances are appended which will indicate the style of\r\ndifferencing which was in vogue, but it should be distinctly remembered\r\nthat the object was not to allocate the bearer of any particular coat of\r\narms to any specific place in the family pedigree, but merely to show that\r\nhe was not the head of the house, entitled to bear the undifferenced arms,\r\nif indeed it would not be more accurate to describe these instances as\r\nsimply examples of different coats of arms used by members of the same\r\nfamily. For it should be remembered that anciently, before the days of\r\n\"black and white\" illustration, prominent change of tincture was admittedly\r\na sufficient distinction between strangers in blood. Beyond the use of the\r\nlabel and the bordure there does not seem to have been any recognised\r\nsystem of differencing until at the earliest the fifteenth\r\ncentury--probably any regulated system does not date much beyond the\r\ncommencement of the series of Visitations.\r\n\r\nOf the four sons of GILLES DE MAILLY, who bore, \"Or, three mallets vert,\"\r\nthe second, third, and fourth sons respectively made the charges \"gules,\"\r\n\"azure,\" and \"sable.\" The \"argent\" field of the DOUGLAS coat was in some\r\nbranches converted into \"ermine\" as early as 1373; and the descendants of\r\nthe DOUGLASES of Dalkeith made the chief \"gules\" instead of \"azure.\" A\r\nsimilar mode of differencing occurs in the Lyon Register in many other\r\nfamilies. The MURRAYS of Culbin in the North bore a \"sable\" field for their\r\narms in lieu of the more usual \"azure,\" and there seems reason to believe\r\nthat the Southern Frasers originally bore their field \"sable,\" the change\r\nto \"azure\" being an alteration made by those branches who migrated\r\nnorthwards. An interesting series of arms is met with in the case of the\r\ndifferences employed by the Earls of Warwick. Waleran, Earl of Warwick (d.\r\n1204), appears to have added to the arms of Warenne (his mother's family)\r\n\"a chevron ermine.\" His son Henry, Earl of Warwick (d. 1229), changed the\r\nchevron to a bend, but Thomas, Earl {485} of Warwick (d. 1242), reverted to\r\nthe chevron, a form which was perpetuated after the earldom had passed to\r\nthe house of Beauchamp. An instance of the addition of mullets to the bend\r\nin the arms of Bohun is met with in the cadet line created Earls of\r\nNorthampton.\r\n\r\nThe shield of WILLIAM DE ROUMARE, Earl of LINCOLN, who died in 1198, is\r\nadduced by Mr. PLANCHÉ as an early example of differencing by crosses\r\ncrosslet; the principal charges being seven mascles conjoined, three,\r\nthree, and one. We find in the Rolls of Arms of the thirteenth and early\r\npart of the fourteenth century many instances of coats crusily, billetty,\r\nbezanty, and \"pleyn d'escallops,\" fleurette, and \"a les trefoiles d'or.\"\r\nWith these last Sir EDMOND DACRE of Westmoreland powdered the shield borne\r\nby the head of his family: \"Gules, three escallops or\" (Roll of Edward\r\nII.). The coat borne by the ACTONS of Aldenham, \"Gules, crusily or, two\r\nlions passant argent,\" is sometimes quoted as a gerated coat of LESTRANGE;\r\nfor EDWARD DE ACTON married the coheiress of LESTRANGE (living 1387), who\r\nbore simply: \"Gules, two lions passant argent.\" That the arms of Acton are\r\nderived from Lestrange cannot be questioned, but the probability is that\r\nthey were _a new invention_ as a distinct coat, the charges suggested by\r\nLestrange. The original coat of the House of Berkeley in England (Barclay\r\nin Scotland) appears to have been: \"Gules, a chevron or\" (or \"argent\"). The\r\nseals of ROBERT DE BERKELEY, who died 4 Henry III., and MAURICE DE\r\nBERKELEY, who died 1281, all show the shield charged with a chevron only.\r\nMORIS DE BARKELE, in the Roll _temp._ Henry III., bears: \"Goules, a chevron\r\nargent.\"\r\n\r\nBut THOMAS, son of MAURICE, who died 15 EDWARD II., has the present coat:\r\n\"Gules, a chevron between ten crosses patée argent;\" while in the roll of\r\nEdward II., \"De goules od les rosettes de argent et un chevron de argent\"\r\nis attributed to Sir THOMAS DE BERKELEY. In Leicestershire the BERKELEYS\r\ngerated with cinquefoils, an ancient and favourite bearing in that county,\r\nderived of course from the arms or badge of the Earl of Leicester. In\r\nScotland the BARCLAYS differenced by change of tincture, and bore: \"Azure,\r\na chevron argent between (or in chief) three crosses patée of the same.\" An\r\ninteresting series of differences is met with upon the arms of NEVILLE of\r\nRaby, which are: \"Gules, a saltire argent,\" and which were differenced by a\r\ncrescent \"sable\"; a martlet \"gules\"; a mullet \"sable\" and a mullet \"azure\";\r\na \"fleur-de-lis\"; a rose \"gules\"; a pellet, or annulet, \"sable,\" this being\r\nthe difference of Lord Latimer; and two interlaced annulets \"azure,\" all\r\nborne on the centre point of the saltire. The interlaced annulets were\r\nborne by Lord Montagu, as a _second_ difference on the arms of his father,\r\nRichard Nevill, Earl of Salisbury, he and his brother the King-maker _both_\r\nusing the curious {486} compony label of azure and argent borne by their\r\nfather, which indicated their descent from John of Gaunt. One of the best\r\nknown English examples of differencing by a change of charges is that of\r\nthe coat of the COBHAMS, \"Gules, a chevron or,\" in which the ordinary was\r\ncharged by various cadets with three pierced estoiles, three lions, three\r\ncrossed crosslets, three \"fleurs-de-lis,\" three crescents, and three\r\nmartlets, all of \"sable.\"\r\n\r\nThe original GREY coat [\"Barry of six argent and azure\"] is differenced in\r\nthe Roll of Edward I. by a bend gules for JOHN DE GREY; at Caerlaverock\r\nthis is engrailed.\r\n\r\nThe SEGRAVE coat [\"Sable, a lion rampant argent\"] is differenced by the\r\naddition of \"a bendlet or\"; or \"a bendlet gules\"; and the last is again\r\ndifferenced by engrailing it.\r\n\r\nIn the Calais Roll the arms of WILLIAM DE WARREN [\"Chequy or and azure\"]\r\nare differenced by the addition of a canton said to be that of FITZALAN\r\n(but really that of NERFORD).\r\n\r\nWhilst no regular system of differencing has survived in France, and whilst\r\noutside the Royal Family arms in that country show comparatively few\r\nexamples of difference marks, the system as regards the French Royal Arms\r\nwas well observed and approximated closely to our own. The Dauphin of\r\nFrance bore the Royal Arms undifferenced but never alone, they being always\r\nquartered with the sovereign arms of his personal sovereignty of Dauphiné:\r\n\"Or, a dolphin embowed azure, finned gules.\" This has been more fully\r\nreferred to on page 254. It is much to be regretted that the arms of H.R.H.\r\nthe Prince of Wales do not include the arms of his sovereignty of the Duchy\r\nof Cornwall, nor any allusion to his dignities of Prince of Wales or Earl\r\nof Chester.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 698.--Seal of Elizabeth, widow of Philip, Duke of\r\nOrleans.]\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Dukes of Orleans were the arms of France differenced by a\r\nlabel argent. This is to be observed, for example, upon the seal (Fig. 698)\r\nof the Duchess Charlotte Elizabeth of Orleans, widow of Philip of Orleans,\r\nbrother of King Louis XIV. of France. She was a daughter of the Elector\r\nCharles Louis. The arms of the old Dukes of Anjou were the ancient coat of\r\nFrance (azure, semé-de-lis or) differenced by a label of five points gules,\r\nbut the younger house {487} of Anjou bore the modern arms of France\r\ndifferenced by a bordure gules. The Dukes d'Alençon also used the bordure\r\ngules, but charged this with eight plates, whilst the Dukes de Berri used a\r\nbordure _engrailed_ gules.\r\n\r\nThe Counts d'Angoulême used the arms of the Dukes of Orleans, adding a\r\ncrescent gules on each point of the label, whilst the Counts d'Artois used\r\nFrance (ancient) differenced by a label gules, each point charged with\r\nthree castles (towers) or.\r\n\r\nThe rules which govern the marks of cadency at present in England are as\r\nfollows, and it should be carefully borne in mind that the Scottish system\r\nbears no relation whatever to the English system. The eldest son during the\r\nlifetime of his father differences his arms by a label of three points\r\ncouped at the ends. This is placed in the centre chief point of the\r\nescutcheon. There is no rule as to its colour, which is left to the\r\npleasure of the bearer; but it is usually decided as follows: (1) That it\r\nshall not be metal on metal, or colour on colour; (2) that it shall not be\r\nargent or white; and, if possible, that it shall differ from any colour or\r\nmetal in which any component part of the shield is depicted. Though\r\nanciently the label was drawn throughout the shield, this does not now seem\r\nto be a method officially adopted. At any rate drawn throughout it\r\napparently obtains no official countenance for the arms of subjects, though\r\nmany of the best heraldic artists always so depict it. The eldest son bears\r\nthis label during his father's lifetime, succeeding to the undifferenced\r\nshield on the death of his father. His children--being the grandchildren of\r\nthe then head of the house--difference upon the label, but such difference\r\nmarks are, like their father's, only contemporary with the life of the\r\ngrandfather, and, immediately upon the succession of their father, the\r\nchildren remove the label, and difference upon the original arms. The use\r\nof arms by a junior grandson is so restricted in ordinary life that to all\r\nintents and purposes this may be ignored, except in the case of the\r\nheir-apparent of the heir-apparent, _i.e._ of the grandson in the lifetimes\r\nof his father and grandfather. In his case one label of _five_ points is\r\nused, and to place a label upon a label is not correct when both are marks\r\nof cadency, and not charges. But the grandson on the death of his father,\r\nduring the lifetime of the grandfather, and when the grandson succeeds as\r\nheir-apparent of the grandfather, succeeds also to the label of three\r\npoints, which may therefore more properly be described as the difference\r\nmark of the heir-apparent than the difference mark of the eldest son. It is\r\nnecessary, perhaps, having said this, to add the remark that heraldry knows\r\nno such thing as disinheritance, and heirship is an inalienable matter of\r\nblood descent, and not of worldly inheritance. No woman can ever be an\r\nheir-apparent. Though now {488} the number of points on a label is a matter\r\nof rule, this is far from having been always the case, and prior to the\r\nStuart period no deductions can be drawn with certainty from the number of\r\nthe points in use. It seems a very great pity that no warrants were issued\r\nfor the children of the then Duke of York during the lifetime of Queen\r\nVictoria, as labels for _great_-grandchildren would have been quite unique.\r\n\r\nIf the eldest son succeeds through the death of his mother to her arms and\r\nquarterings during his father's lifetime, he must be careful that the label\r\nwhich he bears as heir-apparent to his father's arms does not cross the\r\nquartering of his mother's arms.\r\n\r\nIf his father bears a quarterly shield, the label is so placed that it\r\nshall apparently debruise all his father's quarterings, _i.e._ in a shield\r\nquarterly of four the label would be placed in the centre chief point, the\r\ncentre file of the label being upon the palar line, and the other files in\r\nthe first and second quarters respectively, whilst the colour would usually\r\ndepend, as has been above indicated, upon the tinctures of the pronominal\r\narms. Due regard, however, must be had that a label of gules, for example,\r\nis not placed on a field of gules. A parti-coloured label is not nowadays\r\npermissible, though instances of its use can occasionally be met with in\r\nearly examples. Supposing the field of the first quarter is argent, and\r\nthat of the second azure, in all probability the best colour for the label\r\nwould be gules, and indeed gules is the colour most frequently met with for\r\nuse in this purpose.\r\n\r\nIf the father possess the quarterly coat of, say, four quarterings, which\r\nare debruised by a label by the heir-apparent, and the mother die, and the\r\nheir-apparent succeed to her arms, he would of course, after his father's\r\ndeath, arrange his mother's quarterings with these, placing his father's\r\npronominal arms 1 and 4, the father's quartering in the second quarter, and\r\nthe mother's arms in the third quarter. This arrangement, however, is not\r\npermissible during his father's lifetime, because otherwise his label in\r\nchief would be held to debruise _all_ the four coats, and the only method\r\nin which such a combination could be properly displayed in the lifetime of\r\nthe father but after the death of his mother is to place the father's arms\r\nin the grand quartering in the first and fourth quarters, each being\r\ndebruised by the label, and the mother's in the grand quartering in the\r\nsecond and third quarters without any interference by the label.\r\n\r\nThe other marks of difference are: For the second son a crescent; for the\r\nthird son a mullet; for the fourth son a martlet; for the fifth son an\r\nannulet; for the sixth son a fleur-de-lis; for the seventh son a rose; for\r\nthe eighth son a cross moline; for the ninth son a double quatrefoil (Fig.\r\n699).\r\n\r\nOf these the first six are given in BOSSEWELL'S \"Workes of {489} Armorie\"\r\n(1572), and the author adds: \"If there be any more than six brethren the\r\ndevise or assignment of further difference only appertaineth to the kingis\r\nof armes especially when they visite their severall provinces; and not to\r\nthe father of the children to give them what difference he list, as some\r\nwithout authoritie doe allege.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 699.--The English marks of cadency.]\r\n\r\nThe position for a mark of difference is in the centre chief point, though\r\nit is not incorrect (and many such instances will be found) for it to be\r\ncharged on a chevron or fess, in the centre point. This, however, is not a\r\nvery desirable position for it in a simple coat of arms. The second son of\r\nthe second son places a crescent upon a crescent, the third son a mullet on\r\na crescent, the fourth son a martlet on a crescent, and so on; and there is\r\nan instance in the Visitation of London in which the arms of Cokayne appear\r\nwith _three_ crescents one upon another: this instance has been already\r\nreferred to on page 344. Of course, when the English system is carried to\r\nthese lengths it becomes absurd, because the crescents charged one upon\r\neach other become so small as to be practically indistinguishable. There\r\nare, however, very few cases in which such a display would be correct--as\r\nwill be presently explained. This difficulty, which looms large in theory,\r\namounts to very little in the practical use of armory, but it nevertheless\r\nis the one outstanding objection to the English system of difference marks.\r\nIt is constantly held up to derision by those people who are unaware of the\r\nnext rule upon the subject, which is, that as soon as a quartering comes\r\ninto the possession of a cadet branch--which quartering is not enjoyed by\r\nthe head of the house--all necessity for any marks of difference at all is\r\nconsidered to be ended, provided that that quartering is always\r\ndisplayed--and that cadet branch then begins afresh from that generation to\r\nredifference.\r\n\r\nNow there are few English families in whose pedigree during three or four\r\ngenerations one marriage is not with an heiress in blood, so that this\r\ntheoretical difficulty very quickly disappears.\r\n\r\nNo doubt there is always an inducement to retain the quarterings of an\r\nhistorical or illustrious house which may have been brought in in the past,\r\nbut if the honours and lands brought in with that quartering are wholly\r\nenjoyed by the head of the house, it becomes, from a practical point of\r\nview, mere affectation to prefer that quartering to another (brought in\r\nsubsequently) of a family, the entire representation of which belongs to\r\nthe junior branch and not to the senior. If {490} the old idea of confining\r\na shield to four quarters be borne in mind, concurrently with the\r\nnecessity--for purposes of distinction--of introducing new quarterings, the\r\nnew quarterings take the place of the old, the use of which is left to the\r\nsenior branch. Under such circumstances, and the regular practice of them,\r\nthe English system is seldom wanting, and it at once wipes out the\r\ndifficulty which is made much of--that under the English system there is no\r\nway of indicating the difference between the arms of uncle and nephew. If\r\nthe use of impalements is also adhered to, the difficulty practically\r\nvanishes.\r\n\r\nTo difference a _single_ coat the mark of difference is placed in the\r\ncentre chief point; to difference a _quarterly_ coat of four quarters the\r\nsame position on the shield is most generally used, the mark being placed\r\nover the palar line, though occasionally the difference mark is placed, and\r\nnot incorrectly, in the centre of the quarterings. A coat of six quarters,\r\nhowever, is always differenced on the fess line of partition, the mark\r\nbeing placed in the fess point, because if placed in the centre chief point\r\nit would only appear as a difference upon the second quartering, so that on\r\nall shields of six or more quarterings the difference mark must be placed\r\non some line of partition at the nearest possible point to the true centre\r\nfess point of the escutcheon. It is then understood to difference the whole\r\nof the quarterings over which it is displayed, but directly a quartering is\r\nintroduced which has been inherited subsequently to the cadency which\r\nproduced the difference mark, that difference mark must be either discarded\r\nor transferred to the first quartering only.\r\n\r\n_The use of these difference marks is optional._ Neither officially nor\r\nunofficially is any attempt made to enforce their use in England--they are\r\nleft to the pleasure and discretion of the bearers, though it is a\r\nwell-understood and well-accepted position that, unless differenced by\r\nquarterings or impalement, it is neither courteous nor proper for a cadet\r\nto display the arms of the head of his house: beyond this, the matter is\r\nusually left to good taste.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one position in which the use of difference marks is\r\ncompulsory. If under a Royal Licence, or other exemplification--for\r\ninstance, the creation of a peerage--a difference mark is painted upon the\r\narms, or even if an exemplification of the arms differenced is placed at\r\nthe head of an official record of pedigree, those arms would not\r\nsubsequently be exemplified, or their use officially admitted, without the\r\ndifference mark that has been recorded with them.\r\n\r\nThe differencing of crests for cadency is very rare. Theoretically, these\r\nshould be marked equally with the shield, and when arms are exemplified\r\nofficially under the circumstances above referred to, crest, {491}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 700.--King John, before his accession to the throne.\r\n(From MS.

(From his seal, 1381.)]\r\n\r\n{492} supporters, and shield are all equally differenced, but the\r\ndifficulty of adding difference mark on difference mark when no marriage or\r\nheiress can ever bring in any alteration to the crest is very generally\r\nrecognised and admitted, even officially, and it is rare indeed to come\r\nacross a crest carrying more than a single difference mark.\r\n\r\nThe grant of an augmentation to any cadet obviates the slightest necessity\r\nfor any further use of difference marks inherited before the grant.\r\n\r\nThere are no difference marks whatever for daughters, there being in\r\nEnglish common law no seniority between the different daughters of one man.\r\nThey succeed equally, whether heiresses or not, to the arms of their father\r\nfor use during their lifetimes, and they must bear them on their own\r\nlozenges or impaled on the shields of their husbands, with the difference\r\nmarks which their father needed to use. It would be permissible, however,\r\nto discard these difference marks of their fathers if subsequently to his\r\ndeath his issue succeeded to the position of head of the family. For\r\ninstance, suppose the daughters of the younger son of an earl are under\r\nconsideration. They would bear upon lozenges the arms of their father,\r\nwhich would be those of the earl, charged with the mullet or crescent which\r\ntheir father had used as a younger son. If by the extinction of issue the\r\nbrother of these daughters succeed to the earldom, they would no longer be\r\nrequired to bear their father's difference mark.\r\n\r\nThere are no marks of difference between illegitimate children. In the eye\r\nof the law an illegitimate person has no relatives, and stands alone.\r\nSupposing it be subsequently found that a marriage ceremony had been\r\nillegal, the whole issue of that marriage becomes of course illegitimate.\r\nAs such, no one of them is entitled to bear arms. A Royal Licence, and\r\nexemplification following thereupon, is necessary for each single one. Of\r\nthese exemplifications there is one case on record in which I think nine\r\nfollow each other on successive pages of one of the Grant Books: all differ\r\nin some way--usually in the colour of the bordure; but the fact that there\r\nare illegitimate brothers of the same parentage does not prevent the\r\ndescendants of any daughter quartering the differenced coat exemplified to\r\nher. As far as heraldic law is concerned, she is the heiress of herself,\r\nrepresenting only herself, and consequently her heir quarters her arms.\r\n\r\nMarks of difference are never added to an exemplification following upon a\r\nRoyal Licence _after illegitimacy_. Marks of difference are to indicate\r\ncadency, and there is no cadency vested in a person of illegitimate\r\nbirth--their right to the arms proceeding only from the regrant of them in\r\nthe exemplification. What is added in lieu is the _mark of distinction_ to\r\nindicate the bastardy. {493}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 709.--John de Holand, Duke of Exeter, son of preceding.\r\nArms as preceding.

Vincent attributes to him, however, a label as\r\nFig. 719, which possibly he bore after his father's death.]\r\n\r\n{494}\r\n\r\nThe method of differencing the English Royal Arms is quite unique, and has\r\nno relation to the method ordinarily in use in this country for the arms of\r\nsubjects. The Royal Arms are not personal. They are the sovereign arms of\r\ndominion, indicating the sovereignty enjoyed by the person upon the throne.\r\nConsequently they are in no degree hereditary, and from the earliest times,\r\ncertainly since the reign of Edward I., the right to bear the undifferenced\r\narms has been confined exclusively to the sovereign upon the throne. In\r\nearly times there were two methods employed, namely, the use of the bordure\r\nand of varieties of the label, the label of the heir-apparent to the\r\nEnglish throne being originally of azure. The arms of Thomas of Woodstock,\r\nthe youngest son of Edward I., were differenced by a bordure argent; his\r\nelder brother, Thomas de Brotherton, having had a label of three points\r\nargent; whilst the eldest son, Edward II., as Prince of Wales used a label\r\nof three points azure. From that period to the end of the Tudor period the\r\nuse of labels and bordures seems to have continued concurrently, some\r\nmembers of the Royal Family using one, some the other, though there does\r\nnot appear to have been any precise rules governing a choice between the\r\ntwo. When Edward III. claimed the throne of France and quartered the arms\r\nof that country with those of England, of course a portion of the field\r\nthen became azure, and a blue label upon a blue field was no longer\r\npossible. The heir-apparent therefore differenced his shield by the plain\r\nlabel of three points argent, and this has ever since, down to the present\r\nday, continued to be the \"difference\" used by the heir-apparent to the\r\nEnglish throne. A label of gules upon the gules quartering of England was\r\nequally impossible, and consequently from that period all labels used by\r\nany member of the Royal Family have been argent, charged with different\r\nobjects, these being frequently taken from the arms of some female\r\nancestor. Figs. 700 to 730 are a somewhat extensive collection of\r\nvariations of the Royal Arms.\r\n\r\nLionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, third son of Edward III., bore: France\r\n(ancient) and England quarterly, a label of three points argent, and on\r\neach point a canton gules.\r\n\r\nThe use of the bordure as a legitimate difference upon the Royal Arms\r\nceased about the Tudor period, and differencing between members of the\r\nRoyal Family is now exclusively done by means of these labels. A few cases\r\nof bordures to denote illegitimacy can, however, be found. The method of\r\ndeciding these labels is for separate warrants under the hand and seal of\r\nthe sovereign to be issued to the different members of the Royal Family,\r\nassigning to each a certain coronet, and the label to be borne over the\r\nRoyal Arms, crest, and supporters. These warrants are personal to those for\r\nwhom they are {495}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 718.--Richard, Duke of York (son of Edward, Earl of\r\nCambridge and Duke of York): Arms as preceding.

Of late their use, or perhaps may be\r\ntheir issue, has not been quite so particularly conformed to as is\r\ndesirable, and at the present time the official records show the arms of\r\ntheir Royal Highnesses the Duchess of Fife, the Princess Victoria, and the\r\nQueen of Norway, still bearing the label of five points indicative of their\r\nposition as grandchildren of the sovereign, which of course they were when\r\nthe warrants were issued in the lifetime of the late Queen Victoria. In\r\nspite of the fact that the warrants have no hereditary limitation, I am\r\nonly aware of two modern instances in which a warrant has been issued to\r\nthe son of a cadet of the Royal House who had previously received a\r\nwarrant. One of these was the late Duke of Cambridge. The warrant was\r\nissued to him in his father's lifetime, and to the label previously\r\nassigned to his father a second label of three points gules, to be borne\r\ndirectly below the other, was added. The other case was that of his cousin,\r\nafterwards Duke of Cumberland and King of Hanover. In his case the second\r\nlabel, also gules, was charged with the white horse of Hanover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 727.--John, Duke of Bedford, third son of Henry IV.:\r\nFrance and England quarterly, a label of five points, the two dexter\r\nermine, the three sinister azure, charged with three fleurs-de-lis or.\r\n(From MS.

The late Duke\r\nof Clarence charged the centre point of his label of {497} three points\r\nwith a cross couped gules. After his death the Duke of York relinquished\r\nthe label of five points which he had previously borne, receiving one of\r\nthree, the centre point charged with an anchor. In every other case all of\r\nthe points are charged. The following examples of the labels in use at the\r\nmoment will show how the system now exists:--\r\n\r\n_Prince of Wales._--A label of three points argent.\r\n\r\n_Princess Royal_ (Louise, Duchess of Fife).--A label of five points argent,\r\ncharged on the centre and outer points with a cross of St. George gules,\r\nand on the two others with a thistle proper.\r\n\r\n_Princess Victoria._--A label of five points argent, charged with three\r\nroses and two crosses gules.\r\n\r\n_Princess Maud_ (H.M.

His son, the hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg\r\nand Gotha, who predeceased his father, bore a label of five points, the\r\nfirst, third, and fifth each charged with a cross gules, and the second and\r\nfourth each with an anchor azure (Fig. 731).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 731.--Label of the late hereditary Prince of\r\nSaxe-Coburg and Gotha.]\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Connaught._--A label of three points argent, the centre point\r\ncharged with St. George's cross, and each of the other points with a\r\nfleur-de-lis azure.\r\n\r\n_The late Princess Royal_ (German Empress).--A label of three points\r\nargent, the centre point charged with a rose gules, and each of the others\r\nwith a cross gules.\r\n\r\n_The late Grand Duchess of Hesse._--A label of three points argent, the\r\ncentre point charged with a rose gules, and each of the others with an\r\nermine spot sable.\r\n\r\n_Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein._--A label of three points, the\r\ncentre point charged with St. George's cross, and each of the other points\r\nwith a rose gules.\r\n\r\n_Princess Louise_ (Duchess of Argyll).--A label of three points, the centre\r\npoint charged with a rose, and each of the other two with a canton gules.\r\n\r\n_Princess Henry of Battenberg._--A label of three points, the centre point\r\ncharged with a heart, and each of the other two with a rose gules.\r\n\r\n_The late Duke of Albany._--A label of three points, the centre point\r\ncharged with a St. George's cross, and each of the other two with a heart\r\ngules. {498}\r\n\r\n_The Dukes of Cambridge._--The first Duke had a label of three points\r\nargent, the centre point charged with a St. George's cross, and each of the\r\nother two with _two_ hearts in pale gules. The warrant to the late Duke\r\nassigned him the same label with the addition of a second label, plain, of\r\nthree points gules, to be borne below the former label.\r\n\r\n_The first Duke of Cumberland._--A label of three points argent, the centre\r\npoint charged with a fleur-de-lis azure, and each of the other two points\r\nwith a cross of St. George gules.\r\n\r\nOf the foregoing recently assigned labels all are borne over the plain\r\nEnglish arms (1 and 4 England, 2 Scotland, 3 Ireland), charged with the\r\nescutcheon of Saxony, except those of the Dukes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha,\r\nCambridge, and Cumberland. In the two latter cases the labels are borne\r\nover the _latest_ version of the arms of King George III., _i.e._ with the\r\ninescutcheon of Hanover, but, of course, neither the electoral bonnet nor\r\nthe later crown which surmounted the inescutcheon of Hanover was made use\r\nof, and the smaller inescutcheon bearing the crown of Charlemagne was also\r\nomitted for the children of George III., except in the case of the Prince\r\nof Wales, who bore the plain inescutcheon of gules, but without the crown\r\nof Charlemagne thereupon.\r\n\r\nThe labels for the other sons and daughters of King George III. were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n_The Duke of York._--A label of three points argent, the centre point\r\ncharged with a cross gules. The Duke of York bore upon the inescutcheon of\r\nHanover an inescutcheon argent (in the place occupied in the Royal Arms by\r\nthe inescutcheon charged with the crown of Charlemagne) charged with a\r\nwheel of six spokes gules, for the Bishopric of Osnaburgh, which he\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Clarence_ (afterwards William IV.).--A label of three points\r\nargent, the centre point charged with a cross gules, and each of the others\r\nwith an anchor erect azure.\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Kent_ had his label charged with a cross gules between two\r\nfleurs-de-lis azure.\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Sussex._--The label argent charged with two hearts in pale\r\ngules in the centre point between two crosses gules.\r\n\r\n_The Princess Royal_ (Queen of Würtemberg).--A rose between two crosses\r\ngules.\r\n\r\n_The Princess Augusta._--A like label, charged with a rose gules between\r\ntwo ermine spots.\r\n\r\n_The Princess Elizabeth_ (Princess of Hesse-Homburg).--A like label charged\r\nwith a cross between two roses gules.\r\n\r\n_The Princess Mary_ (Duchess of Gloucester).--A like label, charged with a\r\nrose between two cantons gules. {499}\r\n\r\n_The Princess Sophia._--A like label, charged with a heart between two\r\nroses gules.\r\n\r\n_The Princess Amelia._--A like label, charged with a rose between two\r\nhearts gules.\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Gloucester_ (brother of George III.).--A label of _five_\r\npoints argent, charged with a fleur-de-lis azure between four crosses\r\ngules. His son (afterwards Duke of Gloucester) bore an additional plain\r\nlabel of three points during the lifetime of his father.\r\n\r\nThe Royal labels are placed across the shield, on the crest, and on each of\r\nthe supporters. The crest stands upon and is crowned with a coronet\r\nidentical with the circlet of any coronet of rank assigned in the same\r\npatent; the lion supporter is crowned and the unicorn supporter is gorged\r\nwith a similar coronet. It may perhaps be of interest to note that no\r\nbadges and no motto are ever now assigned in these Royal Warrants except in\r\nthe case of the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nF.-M. H.S.H. Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, the Consort of H.R.H. the\r\nPrincess Charlotte (only child of George IV.), received by warrant dated\r\nApril 7, 1818, the right \"to use and bear the Royal Arms (without the\r\ninescocheon of Charlemagne's crown, and without the Hanoverian Royal crown)\r\ndifferenced with a label of five points argent, the centre point charged\r\nwith a rose gules, quarterly with the arms of his illustrious House ['Barry\r\nof ten sable and or, a crown of rue in bend vert'], the Royal Arms in the\r\nfirst and fourth quarters.\"\r\n\r\nBy Queen Victoria's desire this precedent was followed in the case of the\r\nlate Prince Consort, the label in his case being of three points argent,\r\nthe centre point charged with a cross gules, and, by a curious coincidence,\r\nthe arms of his illustrious House, with which the Royal Arms were\r\nquartered, were again the arms of Saxony, these appearing in the second and\r\nthird quarters.\r\n\r\nQuite recently a Royal Warrant has been issued for H.M. Queen Alexandra.\r\nThis assigns, upon a single shield within the Garter, the undifferenced\r\narms of His Majesty impaled with the undifferenced arms of Denmark. The\r\nshield is surmounted by the Royal crown. The supporters are: (dexter) the\r\nlion of England, and (sinister) a savage wreathed about the temples and\r\nloins with oak and supporting in his exterior hand a club all proper. This\r\nsinister supporter is taken from the Royal Arms of Denmark.\r\n\r\nAbroad there is now no equivalent whatever to our methods of differencing\r\nthe Royal Arms. An official certificate was issued to me recently from\r\nDenmark of the undifferenced Royal Arms of Denmark certified as correct for\r\nthe \"Princes and Princesses\" of that country. But the German Crown Prince\r\nbears his shield within a bordure gules, and anciently in France (from\r\nwhich country the English system was {500} very probably originally\r\nderived) the differencing of the Royal French Arms for the younger branches\r\nseems to have been carefully attended to, as has been already specified.\r\n\r\nDifferencing in Scotland is carried out on an entirely different basis from\r\ndifferencing in England. In Scotland the idea is still rigidly preserved\r\nand adhered to that the coat of arms of a family belongs only to the head\r\nof the family for the time being, and the terms of a Scottish grant are as\r\nfollows: \"Know ye therefore that we have devised and do by these presents\r\nassign ratify and confirm to the said ---- and his descendants _with such\r\ncongruent differences as may hereafter be matriculated for them the\r\nfollowing ensigns armorial_.\" Under the accepted interpretation of Scottish\r\narmorial law, whilst the inherent gentility conferred by a patent of arms\r\nis not denied to cadets, no right to make use of arms is conceded to them\r\nuntil such time as they shall elect to matriculate the arms of their\r\nancestor in their own names. This point has led to a much purer system of\r\nheraldry in Scotland than in England, and there is far less heraldic abuse\r\nin that country as a result, because the differences are decided not\r\nhaphazardly by the user himself, as is the case in England, but by a\r\ncompetent officer of arms. Moreover the constant occasions of matriculation\r\nbring the arms frequently under official review. There is no fixed rule\r\nwhich decides _ipse facto_ what difference shall be borne, and consequently\r\nthis decision has retained in the hands of the heraldic executive an amount\r\nof control which they still possess far exceeding that of the executive in\r\nEngland, and perhaps the best way in which to state the rules which hold\r\ngood will be to reprint a portion of one of the Rhind Lectures, delivered\r\nby Sir James Balfour Paul, which is devoted to the point:--\r\n\r\n\"I have said that in Scotland the principle which limited the number of\r\npaternal coats led to a careful differencing of these coats as borne by the\r\njunior branches of the family. Though the English system was sometimes\r\nused, it has never obtained to any great extent in Scotland, the practice\r\nhere being generally to difference by means of a bordure, in which way many\r\nmore generations are capable of being distinguished than is possible by the\r\nEnglish method. The weak point of the Scottish system is that, whilst the\r\ngeneral idea is good, there is no definite rule whereby it can be carried\r\nout on unchanging lines; much is left to the discretion of the authorities.\r\n\r\n\"As a general rule, it may be stated that the second son bears a plain\r\nbordure of the tincture of the principal charge in the shield, and his\r\nyounger brothers also bear plain bordures of varying tinctures. In the next\r\ngeneration the eldest son of the second son would bear his father's coat\r\nand bordure without change; the second son would have the bordure\r\nengrailed; the third, invected; the fourth, indented, {501} and so on, the\r\nother sons of the younger sons in this generation differencing their\r\nfather's bordures in the same way. The junior members of the next\r\ngeneration might have their bordures parted per pale, the following\r\ngenerations having their bordures parted per fess and per saltire, per\r\ncross or quarterly, gyronny or compony, that is, divided into alternate\r\nspaces of metal or colour in a single trace--this, however, being often in\r\nScotland a mark of illegitimacy--counter-compone or a similar pattern in\r\ntwo tracts, or chequy with three or more tracts.\r\n\r\n\"You will see that these modifications of the simple bordure afford a great\r\nvariety of differences, and when they are exhausted the expedient can then\r\nbe resorted to of placing on the bordures charges taken from other coats,\r\noften from those of a maternal ancestor; or they may be arbitrarily\r\nassigned to denote some personal characteristic of the bearer, as in the\r\ncase of James Maitland, Major in the Scots regiment of Foot Guards, who\r\ncarries the dismembered lion of his family within a bordure wavy azure\r\ncharged with eight hand grenades or, significant, I presume, of his\r\nmilitary profession.\r\n\r\n\"You will observe that, with all these varieties of differencing we have\r\nmentioned, the younger branches descending from the original eldest son of\r\nthe parent house are still left unprovided with marks of cadency. These,\r\nhowever, can be arranged for by taking the ordinary which appears in their\r\nfather's arms and modifying its boundary lines. Say the original coat was\r\n'argent, a chevron gules,' the second son of the eldest son would have the\r\nchevron engrailed, but without any bordure; the third, invected, and so on;\r\nand the next generations the systems of bordures accompanying the modified\r\nchevron would go on as before. And when all these methods are exhausted,\r\ndifferences can still be made in a variety of ways, _e.g._ by charging the\r\nordinary with similar charges in a similar manner to the bordure as Erskine\r\nof Shielfield, a cadet of Balgownie, who bore: 'Argent, on a pale sable, a\r\ncross crosslet fitchée or within a bordure azure'; or by the introduction\r\nof an ordinary into a coat which had not one previously, a bend or the\r\nribbon (which is a small bend) being a favourite ordinary to use for this\r\npurpose. Again, we occasionally find a change of tincture of the field of\r\nthe shield used to denote cadency.\r\n\r\n\"There are other modes of differencing which need not be alluded to in\r\ndetail, but I may say that on analysing the earlier arms in the Lyon\r\nRegister, I find that the bordure is by far the most common method of\r\nindicating cadency, being used in no less than 1080 cases. The next most\r\npopular way is by changing the boundary lines of an ordinary, which is done\r\nin 563 shields; 233 cadets difference their arms by the insertion of a\r\nsmaller charge on the ordinary and 195 on {502} the shield. A change of\r\ntincture, including counterchanging, is carried out in 155 coats, and a\r\ncanton is added in 70 cases, while there are 350 coats in which two or more\r\nof the above methods are used. From these figures, which are approximately\r\ncorrect, you will see the relative frequency of the various modes of\r\ndifferencing. You will also note that the original coat of a family can be\r\ndifferenced in a great many ways so as to show the connection of cadets\r\nwith the parent house. The drawback to the system is that heralds have\r\nnever arrived at a uniform treatment so as to render it possible to\r\ncalculate the exact relationship of the cadets. Much is left, as I said, to\r\nthe discretion of the officer granting the arms; but still it gives\r\nconsiderable assistance in determining the descent of a family.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Stodart, Lyon Clerk Depute, who was an able herald,\r\nparticularly in matters relating to Scotland, had elaborated a definite\r\nsystem of these bordures for differencing which would have done much to\r\nsimplify Scottish cadency. Its weak point was obviously this, that it could\r\nonly be applied to new matriculations of arms by cadets; and so, if adopted\r\nas a definite and unchangeable matter of rule, it might have occasioned\r\ndoubt and misunderstanding in future times with regard to many important\r\nScottish coats now existing, without reference to Mr. Stodart's system. But\r\nthe scheme elaborated by Mr. Stodart is now accepted as the broad basis of\r\nthe Scottish system for matriculations (Fig. 732).\r\n\r\nIn early Scottish seals the bordures are to so large an extent engrailed as\r\nto make it appear that the later and present rule, which gives the plain\r\nbordure to immediate cadets, was not fully recognised or adopted. Bordures\r\ncharged appear at a comparatively early date in Scotland. The bordure\r\ncompony in Scotland and the bordure wavy in England, which are now used to\r\nsignify illegitimacy, will be further considered in a subsequent chapter,\r\nbut neither one nor the other originally carried any such meaning. The\r\ndoubtful legitimacy of the Avondale and Ochiltree Stewarts, who bore the\r\nbordure compony in Scotland, along with its use by the Beauforts in\r\nEngland, has tended latterly to bring that difference into disrepute in the\r\ncadency of lawful sons--yet some of the bearers of that bordure during the\r\nfirst twenty years of the Lyon Register were unquestionably legitimate,\r\nwhilst others, as SCOTT of Gorrenberry and PATRICK SINCLAIR of Ulbester,\r\nwere illegitimate, or at best only legitimated. The light in which the\r\nbordure compony had come to be regarded is shown by a Royal Warrant granted\r\nin 1679 to JOHN LUNDIN of that Ilk, allowing him to drop the coat which his\r\nfamily had hitherto carried, and, as descended of a natural son of WILLIAM\r\nTHE LION, to bear the arms of Scotland within a bordure compony argent and\r\nazure. {503}\r\n\r\nThe bordure counter-compony is assigned to fifteen persons, none of them,\r\nit is believed, of illegitimate descent, and some expressly said to be\r\n\"lineallie and lawfulie descended\" from the ancestor whose arms they bore\r\nthus differenced. The idea of this bordure having been at any time a mark\r\nof bastardy is a very modern error, arising from a confusion with the\r\nbordure compony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 732.--The scheme of Cadency Bordures devised by Mr.\r\nStodart.]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, attention needs to be pointedly drawn to the fact that all\r\nchanges in arms are not due to cadency, nor is it safe always to presume\r\ncadency from proved instances of change. Instead of merely detailing\r\nisolated instances of variation in a number of different families, the\r\nmatter may be better illustrated by closely following the successive\r\nvariations in the same family, and an instructive instance is met with in\r\nthe case of the arms of the family of Swinton of that Ilk. This is\r\npeculiarly instructive, because at no point in the descent covered by the\r\narms referred to is there any doubt or question as to the fact of\r\nlegitimate descent.\r\n\r\nClaiming as they do a male descent and inheritance from Liulf the son of\r\nEdulf, Vicecomes of Northumbria, whose possession before {504} 1100 of the\r\nlands of Swinton is the earliest contemporary evidence which has come down\r\nto us of landowning by a Scottish subject, it is unfortunate that we cannot\r\nwith authority date their armorial ensigns before the later half of the\r\nthirteenth century. Charters there are in plenty. Out of the twenty-three\r\nearliest Scottish writings given in the National MSS. of Scotland, nine,\r\ntaken from the Coldingham documents preserved at Durham, refer to the\r\nvillage and lands of Swinton. Among these are two confirmations by David\r\nI., _i.e._ before 1153, of Swinton \"in hereditate sibi et heredibus\" to\r\n\"meo militi Hernulfo\" or \"Arnolto isti meo Militi,\" the first of the family\r\nto follow the Norman fashion, and adopt the territorial designation of de\r\nSwinton; while at Durham and elsewhere, Cospatric de Swinton and his son\r\nAlan and grandson Alan appear more than eighty times in charters before\r\n1250.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 733.--Seal of Alan de Swinton, _c._ 1271.]\r\n\r\nBut it is not till we come to _c._ 1271 that we find a Swinton seal still\r\nattached to a charter. This is a grant by a third Alan of the Kirk croft of\r\nLower Swinton to God and the blessed Cuthbert and the blessed Ebba and the\r\nPrior and Monks of Coldingham. The seal is of a very early form (Fig. 733),\r\nand may perhaps have belonged to the father and grandfather of the\r\nparticular Alan who uses it.\r\n\r\nOf the Henry de Swinton who came next, and who swore fealty to Edward the\r\nFirst of England at Berwick in 1296, and of yet a fourth Alan, no seals are\r\nknown. These were turbulent days throughout Scotland: but then we find a\r\ndistinct advance; a shield upon a diapered ground, and upon it the single\r\nboar has given place to the three boars' heads which afterwards became so\r\ncommon in Scotland. Nisbet lends his authority to the tradition that all\r\nthe families of Border birth who carried them--Gordon, Nisbet, Swinton,\r\nRedpath, Dunse, he mentions, and he might have added others--were\r\noriginally of one stock, and if so, the probability must be that the breed\r\nsprung from Swinton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 734.--Seal of Henry de Swinton, 1378.]\r\n\r\nThis seal (Fig. 734) was put by a second Henry de Swynton to one of the\r\nfamily charters, probably of the date of 1378, which have lately been\r\nplaced for safe keeping in the Register House in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nHis successor, Sir John, the hero of Noyon in Picardy, of Otterburn, and\r\nHomildon, was apparently the first of the race to use {505} supporters. His\r\nseal (Fig. 735) belongs to the second earliest of the Douglas charters\r\npreserved at Drumlanrig. Its date is 1389, and Sir John de Swintoun is\r\ndescribed as Dominus de Mar, a title he bore by right of his marriage with\r\nMargaret, Countess of Douglas and Mar. This probably also accounts for his\r\ncoronet, and it is interesting to note that the helmet, coronet, and crest\r\nare the exact counterpart of those on the Garter plate of Ralph, Lord\r\nBasset, in St. George's Chapel at Windsor. It is possibly more than a\r\ncoincidence, for Froissart mentions them both as fighting in France ten to\r\ntwenty years earlier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 735.--Seal of Sir John de Swinton, 1389.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 736.--Seal of Sir John de Swinton, 1475.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 737.--Seal of Robert Swinton, of that Ilk, 1598.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 738.--Arms of Swinton. (From Swinton Church, 163-.)]\r\n\r\nOf his son, the second Sir John, \"Lord of that Ilk,\" we have no seal. His\r\nlance it was that overthrew Thomas, Duke of Clarence, the brother of Henry\r\nV., at Beaugé in 1421, and he fell, a young man, three years later with the\r\nflower of the Scottish army at Verneuil; but in 1475 his son, a third Sir\r\nJohn, uses the identical crest and shield which his descendants carry to\r\nthis day (Fig. 736). John had become a common name in the family, and the\r\nsame or a similar seal did duty for the next three generations; but in 1598\r\nwe find the great-great-grandson, Robert Swinton of that Ilk, who\r\nrepresented Berwickshire in the first regularly constituted Parliament of\r\nScotland, altering the character of the boars' heads (Fig. 737). He would\r\nalso appear to have placed upon the chevron something which is difficult to\r\ndecipher, but is probably the rose so borne by the Hepburns, his second\r\nwife having been a daughter of Sir Patrick Hepburn of Whitecastle.\r\n\r\nWhatever the charge was, it disappeared from the shield (Fig. 738) erected\r\non the outer wall of Swinton Church by his second son and eventual heir,\r\nSir Alexander, also member for his native county; but {506} the boars'\r\nheads are turned the other way, perhaps in imitation of those above the\r\nvery ancient effigy of the first Sir Alan inside the church.\r\n\r\nSir Alexander's son, John Swinton, \"Laird Swinton\" Carlyle calls him,\r\nwrecked the family fortunes. According to Bishop Burnet he was \"the man of\r\nall Scotland most trusted and employed by Cromwell,\" and he died a Quaker,\r\nexcommunicated and forfeited. To the circumstance that when, in 1672, the\r\norder went out that all arms were to be officially recorded, he was a\r\nbroken man under sentence that his arms should be \"laceret and delete out\r\nof the Heralds' Books,\" we probably owe it that until of late years no\r\nSwinton arms appeared on the Lyon Register.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 739.--Bookplate of Sir John Swinton of that Ilk, 1707.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 740.--Bookplate of Archibald Swinton of Kimmerghame.]\r\n\r\nThen to come to less stirring times, and turn to book-plates. His son, yet\r\nanother Sir John of that Ilk, in whose favour the forfeiture was rescinded,\r\nsat for Berwickshire in the last Parliament of Scotland and the first of\r\nGreat Britain. His bookplate (Fig. 739) is one of the earliest Scottish\r\ndated plates.\r\n\r\nHis grandson, Captain Archibald Swinton of Kimmerghame, county Berwick\r\n(Fig. 740), was an ardent book collector up to his death in 1804, and\r\nArchibald's great-grandson, Captain George C. Swinton (Fig. 741), walked as\r\nMarch Pursuivant in the procession in Westminster Abbey at the coronation\r\nof King Edward the Seventh of {507} England in 1902, and smote on the gate\r\nwhen that same Edward as First of Scotland claimed admission to his castle\r\nof Edinburgh in 1903.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 741.--Bookplate of Captain George S. Swinton, March\r\nPursuivant of Arms.]\r\n\r\nThe arms as borne to-day by the head of the family, John Edulf Blagrave\r\nSwinton of Swinton Bank, a lieutenant in the Lothians and Berwickshire\r\nImperial Yeomanry, are as given (Plate IV.). {508}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nMARKS OF BASTARDY\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that the knowledge of \"the man in the street\" is least\r\nincorrect when he knows nothing. Probably the only heraldic knowledge that\r\na large number possess is summed up in the assertion that the heraldic sign\r\nof illegitimacy is the \"bar sinister.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is to the novelists--who, seeking to touch lightly upon an\r\nunpleasant subject, have ignorantly adopted a French colloquialism--that we\r\nmust attribute a great deal of the misconception which exists concerning\r\nillegitimacy and its heraldic marks of indication. I assert most\r\nunhesitatingly that there are not now and never have been any unalterable\r\nlaws as to what these marks should be, and the colloquialism which insists\r\nupon the \"bar sinister\" is a curiously amusing example of an utter\r\nmisnomer. To any one with the most rudimentary knowledge of heraldry it\r\nmust plainly be seen to be radically impossible to depict a bar sinister,\r\nfor the simple reason that the bar is neither dexter nor sinister. It is\r\nutterly impossible to draw a bar sinister--such a thing does not exist. But\r\nthe assertion of many writers with a knowledge of armory that \"bar\r\nsinister\" is a mistake for \"bend sinister\" is also somewhat misleading,\r\nbecause the real mistake lies in the spelling of the term. The \"barre\r\nsinistre\" is merely the French translation of bend sinister, the French\r\nword \"barre\" meaning a _bend_. The French \"barre\" is not the English \"bar.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to properly understand the true significance of the marks of\r\nillegitimacy, it is necessary that the attempt should be made to transplant\r\noneself into the environment when the laws and rules of heraldry were in\r\nthe making. At that period illegitimacy was of little if any account. It\r\nhas not debarred the succession of some of our own sovereigns, although,\r\nfrom the earliest times, the English have always been more prudish upon the\r\npoint than other nations. In Ireland, even so late as the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth, it is a striking genealogical difficulty to decide in many noble\r\npedigrees which if any of the given sons of any person were legitimate, and\r\nwhich of the ladies of his household, if any, might be legally termed his\r\nwife. In Scotland we find the same thing, though perhaps it is not quite so\r\n{509} blatant to so late a date, but considering what are and have been the\r\nScottish laws of marriage, it is the _fact_ or otherwise of marriage which\r\nhas to be ascertained; and though in England the legal status was\r\nrecognised from an earlier period, the social status of the illegitimate\r\noffspring of a given man depended little upon the legal legitimacy of\r\nbirth, but rather upon the amount of recognition the bastard received from\r\nhis father. If a man had an unquestionably legitimate son, that son\r\nundoubtedly succeeded; but if he had not, any technical stain upon the\r\nbirth of the others had little effect in preventing their succession. A\r\nstudy of the succession to the Barony of Meinill clearly shows that the\r\nillegitimate son of the second Lord Meinill succeeded to the estates and\r\npeerage of his father in preference to his legitimate uncle. There are many\r\nother analogous cases. And when the Church juggled at its pleasure with the\r\nsacrament of marriage--dispensing and annulling or recognising marriages\r\nfor reasons which we nowadays can only term whimsical--small wonder is it\r\nthat the legal fact, though then admitted, had little of the importance\r\nwhich we now give to it. When the actual fact was so little more than a\r\nmatter at the personal pleasure of the person most concerned, it would be\r\nridiculous to suppose that any perpetuation of a mere advertisement of the\r\nfact would be considered necessary, whilst the fact itself was so often\r\nignored; so that until comparatively recent times the Crown certainly never\r\nattempted to enforce any heraldic marks of illegitimacy. Rather were these\r\nenforced by the legitimate descendants if and when such descendants\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nThe point must have first arisen when there were both legitimate and\r\nillegitimate descendants of a given person, and it was desired to make\r\nrecord of the true line in which land or honours should descend. To effect\r\nthis purpose, the arms of the illegitimate son were made to carry some\r\ncharge or alteration to show that there was some reason which debarred\r\ninheritance by their users, whilst there remained those entitled to bear\r\nthe arms without the mark of distinction. But be it noted that this\r\nobligation existed equally on the legitimate cadets of a family, and in the\r\nearliest periods of heraldry there is little or no distinction either in\r\nthe marks employed or in the character of the marks, which can be drawn\r\nbetween mere marks of cadency and marks of illegitimacy. Until a\r\ncomparatively recent period it is absolutely unsafe to use these marks as\r\nsignifying or proving either legitimate cadency or illegitimacy. The same\r\nmark stood for both, the only object which any distinctive change\r\naccomplished, being the distinction which it was necessary to draw between\r\nthose who owned the right to the undifferenced arms, and owned the land,\r\nand those who did not. The object was to safeguard the right of the real\r\n{510} possessors and their true heirs, and not to penalise the others.\r\nThere was no particular mark either for cadency or for illegitimacy, the\r\ndistinctions made being dictated by what seemed the most suitable and\r\ndistinctive mark applicable to the arms under consideration.\r\n\r\nWhen that much has been thoroughly grasped, one gets a more accurate\r\nunderstanding of the subject. One other point has to be borne in mind (and\r\nto the present generation, which knows so well how extensively arms have\r\nbeen improperly assumed, the statement may seem startling), and that is,\r\nthat the use of arms was formerly evidence of pedigree. As late as the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century evidence of this character was\r\nsubmitted to the Committee of Privileges at the hearing of a Peerage case.\r\nThe evidence was _admitted_ for that purpose, though doubt (in that case\r\nvery properly) was thrown upon its value.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in view of the two foregoing facts, there can be very little\r\ndoubt that the use of armorial marks of bastardy _was not invented or\r\ninstituted, nor were these marks enforced, as punishment or as a disgrace_.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious instance how a careful study of words and terms employed\r\nwill often afford either a clue or confirmation, when the true meaning of\r\nthe term has long been overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe official term for a mark of cadency is a \"difference\" mark, _i.e._ it\r\nwas a mark to show the difference between one member of a family and\r\nanother. The mark used to signify a lack of blood relationship, and a mark\r\nused to signify illegitimacy are each termed a \"mark of distinction,\"\r\n_i.e._ a mark that shall make something plainly \"distinct.\" What is that\r\nsomething? The fact that the use of the arms is not evidence of descent\r\nthrough which heirship can be claimed or proved. This, by the way, is a\r\npatent example of the advantage of adherence to precedent.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable conclusion is that a bastard was originally only required to\r\nmark his shield sufficiently that it should be distinctly apparent that\r\nheirship would never accrue. The arms had to be distinct from those borne\r\nby those members of the family upon whom heirship might devolve. The social\r\nposition of a bastard as \"belonging\" to a family was pretty generally\r\nconceded, therefore he carried their arms, sufficiently marked to show he\r\nwas not in the line of succession.\r\n\r\nThis being accepted, one at once understands the great variety of the marks\r\nwhich have been employed. These answered the purpose of distinction, and\r\nnothing more was demanded or necessary. Consequently a recapitulation of\r\nmarks, of which examples can be quoted, would be largely a list of isolated\r\ninstances, and as such they are useless for the purposes of deduction in\r\nany attempt to arrive at a correct conclusion as to what the ancient rules\r\nwere. In brief, there were no {511} rules until the eighteenth, or perhaps\r\neven until the nineteenth century. The only rule was that the arms must be\r\nsufficiently marked in _some_ way. This is borne out by the dictum of\r\nMenêstrier.\r\n\r\nExcept the label, which has been elsewhere referred to, the earliest marks\r\nof either cadency or illegitimacy for which accepted use can be found are\r\nthe bend and the bordure; but the bend for the purpose of illegitimacy\r\nseems to be the earlier, and a bend superimposed over a shield remained a\r\nmark of illegitimate cadency until a comparatively late period. This bend\r\nas a difference naturally was originally depicted as a bend dexter, and as\r\na mark of legitimate cadency is found in the arms of the _younger_ son of\r\nEdmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, before he succeeded his elder\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nThere are scores of other similar instances which a little research will\r\nshow. Whether the term \"left-handed marriage\" is the older, and the\r\nsinister bend is derived therefrom, or whether the slang term is derived\r\nfrom the sinister bend, it is perhaps not necessary to inquire. But there\r\nis no doubt that from an early period the bend of cadency, when such\r\ncadency was illegitimate, is frequently met with in the sinister form. But\r\nconcurrently with such usage instances are found in which the dexter bend\r\nwas used for the same purpose, and it is very plainly evident that it was\r\nnever at that date looked upon as a penalty, but was used merely as a\r\n_distinction_, or for the purpose of showing that the wearer was not the\r\nhead of his house or in possession of the lordship. The territorial idea of\r\nthe nature of arms, which has been alluded to in the chapter upon marks of\r\ncadency, should be borne in mind in coming to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nSoon after the recognition of the bend as a mark of illegitimacy we come\r\nacross the bordure; but there is some confusion with this, bordures of all\r\nkinds being used indiscriminately to denote both legitimate and\r\nillegitimate cadency. There are countless other forms of marking\r\nillegitimacy, and it is impossible to attempt to summarise them, and\r\nabsolutely impossible to draw conclusions as to any family from marks upon\r\nits arms when this point is under discussion. To give a list of these\r\ninstances would rather seem an attempt to deduce a rule or rules upon the\r\npoint, so I say at once that there was no recognised mark, and any plain\r\ndistinction seems to have been accepted as sufficient; and no distinction\r\nwhatever was made when the illegitimate son, either from failure of\r\nlegitimate issue or other reason, succeeded to the lands and honours of his\r\nfather. Out of the multitude of marks, the bend, and subsequently the bend\r\nsinister, emerge as most frequently in use, and finally the bend sinister\r\nexclusively; so that it has come to be considered, and perhaps correctly as\r\nregards one period, that its use was equivalent to a mark of illegitimacy\r\nin England. {512}\r\n\r\nBut there has always remained to the person of bastard descent the right of\r\ndiscarding the bastardised coat, and adopting a new coat of arms, the only\r\nrequirement as to the new coat being that it shall be so distinct from the\r\nold one as not to be liable to confusion therewith. And it is a moot point\r\nwhether or not a large proportion of the instances which are tabulated in\r\nmost heraldic works as examples of marks of bastardy are anything whatever\r\nof the kind. My own opinion is that many are not, and that it is a mistake\r\nto so consider them; the true explanation undoubtedly in some--and outside\r\nthe Royal Family probably in most--being that they are new coats of arms\r\nadopted _as_ new coats of arms, doubtless bearing relation to the old\r\nfamily coat, but sufficiently distinguished therefrom to rank as new arms,\r\nand were never intended to be taken as, and never were bastardised examples\r\nof formerly existing coats. It is for this reason that I have refrained\r\nfrom giving any extensive list such as is to be found in most other\r\ntreatises on heraldry, for all that can be said for such lists is that they\r\nare lists of the specific arms of specific bastards, which is a very\r\ndifferent matter from a list of heraldic marks of illegitimacy.\r\n\r\nAnother objection to the long lists which most heraldic works give of early\r\ninstances of marks of bastardy as data for deduction lies in the fact that\r\nmost are instances of the illegitimate children of Royal personages. It is\r\nsingularly unsafe to draw deductions, to be applied to the arms of others,\r\nfrom the Royal Arms, for these generally have laws unto themselves.\r\n\r\nThe bend sinister in its bare simplicity, as a mark of illegitimacy, was\r\nseldom used, the more frequent form being the sinister bendlet, or even the\r\ndiminutive of that, the cottise. There is no doubt, of course, that when a\r\nsinister bend or bendlet debruises another coat that that is a bastardised\r\nversion of an older coat, but examples can be found of the sinister bend as\r\na charge which has no reference whatever to illegitimacy. Two instances\r\nthat come to mind, which can be found by reference to any current peerage,\r\nare the arms of Shiffner and Burne-Jones. Certainly in these cases I know\r\nof no illegitimacy, and neither coat is a bastardised version of an older\r\nexisting coat. Anciently the bendlet was drawn across arms and quarterings,\r\nand an example of a coat of arms of some number of quarterings debruised\r\nfor an illegitimate family is found in the registration of a Talbot\r\npedigree in one of the Visitation Books. As a mark of distinction upon arms\r\nthe bend sinister for long past has fallen out of use, though for the\r\npurpose of differencing crests a bendlet wavy sinister is still made use\r\nof, and will be again presently referred to.\r\n\r\nNext to the bend comes the bordure. Bordures of all kinds were used for the\r\npurposes of cadency from practically the earliest periods {513} of heraldic\r\ndifferencing. But they were used indiscriminately, as has been already\r\nstated, both for legitimate and illegitimate cadency. John of Gaunt, as is\r\nwell known, was the father of Henry IV. and the ancestor of Henry VII., the\r\nformer being the issue of his legitimate wife, the latter coming from a son\r\nwho, as one of the old chroniclers puts it, \"was of double advowtrie\r\nbegotten.\" But, as every one knows, John of Gaunt's children by Catherine\r\nRoet or Swynford were legitimated by Act of Parliament, the Act of\r\nParliament not excepting the succession to the Throne, a disability later\r\nintroduced in Letters Patent of the Crown when giving a subsequent\r\nconfirmation of the Act, but which, nevertheless, they could not overrule.\r\nBut taking the sons of the latter family as legitimate, which (whatever may\r\nhave been the moral aspect of the case) they were undoubtedly in the eyes\r\nof the common law after the passing of the Act referred to, they existed\r\nconcurrently with the undoubtedly senior descendants of the first marriage\r\nof John of Gaunt with Blanche of Lancaster, and it was necessary--whether\r\nthey were legitimate or not--to distinguish the arms of the junior from the\r\nsenior branch. The result was that as legitimate cadets, and not as\r\nbastards, the arms of John of Gaunt were differenced for the line of the\r\nDukes of Somerset by the addition of the bordure compony argent and\r\nazure--the livery colours of Lancaster. It is a weird position, for these\r\ncolours were derived from the family of the legitimate wife.\r\n\r\nThe fight as to whether these children were legitimate or illegitimate was,\r\nof course, notorious, and a matter of history; but from the fact that they\r\nbore a bordure compony, an idea grew up both in this country and in\r\nScotland also from the similarity of the cases of the doubtful legitimacy\r\nof the Avondale and Ochiltree Stewarts, who both used the bordure compony,\r\nthat the bordure compony was a sign of illegitimacy, whereas in both\r\ncountries at an earlier period it undoubtedly was accepted as a mark of\r\nlegitimate cadency.\r\n\r\nAs a mark of bastardy it had subsequently some extensive use in both\r\ncountries, and it still remains the only mark now used for the purpose in\r\nScottish heraldry. Whether it was that it was not considered as of a fixed\r\nnature, or whether it was that it had become notorious and unacceptable, it\r\nis difficult to say, though the officers of arms have been blamed for\r\nmaking a change on the assumption that it was the latter.\r\n\r\nSome writers who clamour strongly for the _penalising_ of bastard arms, and\r\nfor the plain and recognisable marking of them as such (a position adopted\r\nrather vehemently by Woodward, a singularly erudite heraldic writer), are\r\nrather uncharitable, and at the same time rather lacking in due observation\r\nand careful consideration of ancient ideas {514} and ancient precedents.\r\nThat the recognised mark has been changed at different periods, and as a\r\nconsequence that to a certain extent the advertisement it conveys has been\r\nless patent is, of course, put down to the \"venality\" of mediæval heralds\r\n(happily their backs are broad) by those who are too short-sighted to\r\nobserve that the one thing an official herald moves heaven and earth to\r\nescape from is the making of a new precedent; and that, on the score of\r\nsigns of illegitimacy, the official heralds, when the control of arms\r\npassed into their hands, found no established rule. So far from having been\r\nguilty of venality, as Woodward suggests, they have erred on the other\r\nside, and by having worked only on the limited number of precedents they\r\nfound they have stereotyped the advertisement, and thereby made the\r\nsituation more stringent than they found it.\r\n\r\nWe have it from biblical sources that the sins of the fathers shall be\r\nvisited upon the children unto the third and fourth generations, and this\r\nspirit has undoubtedly crept into the views of many writers, but to get\r\ninto the true perspective of the matter one needs to consider the subject\r\nfrom the point of view of less prudish days than our own.\r\n\r\nI have no wish to be misunderstood. In these days much heraldic reviewing\r\nof the blatant and baser sort depends not upon the value of the work\r\nperformed, a point of view which is never given a thought, but entirely\r\nupon the identity of the writer whose work is under review, and is largely\r\ncomposed of misquotation and misrepresentation. It may perhaps be as well,\r\ntherefore, to state that I am not seeking to condone illegitimacy or to\r\ncombat present opinions upon the point. I merely state that our present\r\nopinions are a modern growth, and that in the thirteenth, fourteenth,\r\nfifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, when the fundamental principles of\r\nheraldry were in the making, it was not considered a disgrace to have an\r\nillegitimate son, nor was it considered then that to be of illegitimate\r\nbirth carried the personal stigma that came later.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the fact remains that a new mark was called into being in\r\nEngland about the year 1780 when in a grant to Zachary to quarter the arms\r\nof Sacheverell, from which family he was in the female line illegitimately\r\ndescended, the bordure wavy was first met with as a sufficient and proper\r\nmark of illegitimacy. The curious point is that before that date in\r\nScotland and in England the bordure wavy possessed nothing of this\r\ncharacter, and to the present day the bordure wavy in Scotland is\r\nundoubtedly nothing more than a legitimate mark of legitimate cadency, for\r\nwhich mark Mr. Stodart provides a place in the scheme of differencing which\r\nhe tabulated as the basis of cadency marks in Scotland (Fig. 732). Since\r\nthat date the bordure wavy has {515} remained the mark which has been used\r\nfor the purpose in England, as the bordure compony has remained the mark in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that the only necessity was some mark which should carry\r\nsufficient _distinction_ from the arms of the family, it follows, as a\r\nnatural consequence of human nature, that as soon as any particular mark\r\nbecame identified with illegitimacy (after that was considered to be a\r\nstigma), that mark was quietly dropped and some other substituted, and no\r\none should be surprised to find the bordures wavy and compony quietly\r\ndisplaced by something else. If any change is to be made in the future it\r\nis to be hoped that no existing mark will be adopted, and that the marks in\r\nEngland and Scotland shall not conflict even if they do not coincide.\r\n\r\nThe bendlet sinister, however, survives in the form of the baton sinister,\r\nwhich is a bendlet couped placed across the centre of the shield. The baton\r\nsinister, however, is a privilege which, as a charge on a shield, is\r\nreserved, such as it is, for Royal bastards. The latest instance of this\r\nwas in the exemplification of arms to the Earl of Munster and his brothers\r\nand sisters early in the nineteenth century. Other surviving instances are\r\nmet with in the arms of the Duke of St. Albans and the Duke of Grafton.\r\nAnother privilege of Royal bastards is that they may have the baton of\r\n_metal_, a privilege which is, according to Berry, denied to those of\r\nhumbler origin.\r\n\r\nAccording to present law the position of an illegitimate person\r\nheraldically is based upon the common law of the country, which practically\r\ndeclares that an illegitimate child has no name, no parentage, and no\r\nrelations. The illegitimacy of birth is an insuperable bar to inheritance,\r\nand a person of illegitimate birth inherits no arms at all, the popular\r\nidea that he inherits a right to the arms subject to a mark of distinction\r\nbeing quite incorrect. He has none at all. There has never been any mark\r\nwhich, as a matter of course and of mere motion, could attach itself\r\nautomatically to a shield, as is the case with the English marks of\r\ndifference, _e.g._ the crescent of the second son or the mullet of the\r\nthird. This is a point upon which I have found mistaken ideas very\r\nfrequently held, even by those who have made some study of heraldry.\r\n\r\nBut a very little thought should make it plain that by the very nature of\r\nthe fact there cannot be either a recognised mark, compulsory use, or an\r\n_ipse facto_ sign. Illegitimacy is negative, not positive--a fact which\r\nmany writers hardly give sufficient weight to.\r\n\r\nIf any one of illegitimate birth desires to obtain a right to arms he has\r\ntwo courses open to him. He can either (not disclosing the fact of his\r\nillegitimacy, and not attempting to prove that he is a descendant of any\r\nkind from any one else) apply for and obtain a new grant of {516} arms on\r\nhis own basis, and worry through the College the grant of a coat as closely\r\nfollowing in design that of the old family as he can get, which means that\r\nhe would be treated and penalised with such _alterations_ (not \"marks of\r\ndistinction\") as would be imposed upon a stranger in blood endeavouring to\r\nobtain arms founded upon a coat to which he had no right. The cost of such\r\na proceeding in England is £76, 10s., the usual fees upon an ordinary\r\ngrant.\r\n\r\nThe alternative course is simple. He must avow himself a bastard, and must\r\nprove his paternity or maternity, as the case may be (for in the eye of the\r\nlaw--common and heraldic--he bears the same relation, which is nil, and the\r\nsame right to the name and arms, which is nil, of both his father and his\r\nmother).\r\n\r\nIllegitimacy under English law affords one of the many instances in which\r\nanomalies exist, for, strange as the statement is, a bastard comes into the\r\nworld without any name at all.\r\n\r\nLegally, at birth a bastard child has then no name at all, and no arms. It\r\nmust subsequently acquire such right to a name (whatever right that may\r\namount to) as user of and reputation therein may give him. He inherits no\r\narms at all, no name, and no property, save by specific devise or bequest.\r\nThe lack of parents operates as a _chasm_ which it is impossible to bridge.\r\nIt is not a case of a peculiar bridge or a faulty bridge; there is no\r\nbridge at all.\r\n\r\nNames, in so far as they are matters of law, are subject to canon law; at\r\nany rate, the law upon the subject, such as it is, originated in canon law,\r\nand not in statute or common law. Canon law was made, and has never since\r\nbeen altered, at a time when surnames were not in existence. A bastard no\r\nmore inherits the surname of the mother than it does the surname of its\r\nfather; and the spirit of petty officialism, so rampant amongst the clergy,\r\nwhich seeks to impose upon a bastard _nolens volens_ the surname of its\r\nmother, has no justification in law or fact. A bastard has precisely as\r\nlittle right to the surname of its mother as it has to the surname of its\r\nfather. Obviously, however, under the customs of our present social life,\r\nevery person must have a surname of one kind or another; and it is here\r\nthat the anomaly in the British law exists, inasmuch as neither statute nor\r\ncanon law provide any means for conferring a surname. That the King has the\r\nprerogative, and exercises it, of conferring or confirming surnames is, of\r\ncourse, unquestioned, but it is hardly to be supposed that the King will\r\ntrouble himself to provide a surname for every illegitimate child which may\r\nbe born; and outside this prerogative, which probably is exercised about\r\nonce a year, there is no method provided or definitely recognised by the\r\nlaw to meet this necessity. To obviate the difficulty, the surname has to\r\nbe that which is conferred upon the child by {517} general custom; and as\r\nan illegitimate child is in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred brought up\r\nby its mother, it is usually by the same custom which confers the surname\r\nof its owner upon a dog in so many parts of the country that a bastard\r\nchild gets known by its mother's surname, and consequently has that surname\r\nconferred upon it by general custom. The only names that an illegitimate\r\nchild has an inalienable right to are the names by which it is baptized;\r\nand if two names are given, and the child or its guardians elect that it\r\nshould be known only by those baptismal names, and if common repute and\r\ngeneral custom, as would be probable, uses the last of those names as a\r\nsurname, there is no legal power on earth which can force upon the child\r\nany other name; and if the last of the baptismal names happens to be its\r\nfather's surname, the child will have an absolute right to be known only by\r\nits Christian names, which to all intents and purposes will mean that it\r\nwill be known by its father's surname.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that an illegitimate child inherits no surname at all, it\r\nequally inherits no arms. Consequently it has no shield upon which to carry\r\na mark of bastardy, if such a mark happened to be in existence. But if\r\nunder a will or deed of settlement an illegitimate child is required to\r\nassume the name and arms of its father _or of its mother_, a Royal Licence\r\nto assume such name and arms is considered to be necessary. It may be here\r\nnoted that voluntary applications to assume a name and arms in the case of\r\nan illegitimate child are not entertained unless it can be clearly shown\r\n(which is not always an easy matter) what the parentage really was.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that I have said he will be required to prove his\r\npaternity. This is rigorously insisted upon, inasmuch as it is not fair to\r\npenalise the reputation of a dead man by inflicting upon him a record of\r\nbastard descendants whilst his own life might have been stainless. An\r\nillegitimate birth is generally recorded under the name of the mother only,\r\nand even when it is given, the truth of any statement as to paternity is\r\nalways open to grave suspicion. There is nothing, therefore, to prevent a\r\nperson asserting that he is the son of a duke, whereas his real father may\r\nhave been in a very plebeian walk in life; and to put the arms of the\r\nduke's family at the mercy of any fatherless person who chose to fancy a\r\ndifferenced version of them would be manifestly unjust, so that without\r\nproof in a legal action of the actual paternity, or some recognition under\r\na will or settlement, it is impossible to adopt the alternative in\r\nquestion. But if such recognition or proof is forthcoming, the procedure is\r\nto petition the Sovereign for a Royal Licence to use (or continue to use)\r\nthe name desired and to bear the arms of the family. Such a petition is\r\nalways granted, on {518} proper proof of the facts, if made in due form\r\nthrough the proper channels. The Royal Licence to that effect is then\r\nissued. But the document contains two conditions, the first being that the\r\narms shall be exemplified according to the laws of arms \"with due and\r\nproper marks of distinction,\" and that the Royal Licence shall be recorded\r\nin the College of Arms, otherwise \"to be void and of none effect.\" The\r\ninvariable insertion of this clause puts into the hands of the College one\r\nof the strongest weapons the officers of arms possess.\r\n\r\nUnder the present practice the due and proper marks of distinction are, for\r\nthe arms, a bordure wavy round the shield of the most suitable colour,\r\naccording to what the arms may be, but if possible of some colour or metal\r\ndifferent from any of the tinctures in the arms. The crest is usually\r\ndifferenced by a bendlet sinister wavy, but a pallet wavy is sometimes\r\nused, and sometimes a saltire wavy, couped or otherwise. The choice between\r\nthese marks generally depends upon the nature of the crest. But even with\r\nthis choice, the anomaly is frequently found of blank space being carefully\r\ndebruised. Seeing that the mark of the debruising is not a tangible object\r\nor thing, but a mark painted upon another object, such a result seems\r\nsingularly ridiculous, and ought to be avoided. Whilst the ancient practice\r\ncertainly appears to have been to make some slight change in the crest, it\r\ndoes not seem to have been debruised in the present manner. There are some\r\nnumber of more recent cases where, whilst the existing arms have been\r\ncharged with the necessary marks of distinction, entirely new, or very much\r\naltered crests have been granted without any recognisable \"marks of\r\ndistinction.\" There can be no doubt that the bendlet wavy sinister upon the\r\ncrest is a palpable penalising of the bearer, and I think the whole subject\r\nof the marks of bastardy in the three kingdoms might with advantage be\r\nbrought under official consideration, with a view to new regulations being\r\nadopted. A bendlet wavy sinister is such an absolute defacement of a crest\r\nthat few can care to make use of a crest so marked. It carries an effect\r\nfar beyond what was originally the intention of marks of distinction.\r\n\r\nA few recent bastardised exemplifications which have issued from Ulster's\r\nOffice have had the crest charged with a baton couped sinister. The baton\r\ncouped sinister had always hitherto been confined to the arms of Royal\r\nbastards, but I am not aware of any Royal crest so bastardised. Of course\r\nno circumstances can be conceived in which it is necessary to debruise\r\nsupporters, as under no circumstances can these be the subject of a Royal\r\nLicence of this character, except in a possible case where they might have\r\nbeen granted as a simple augmentation to a man and his descendants, without\r\nfurther limitation. I know of no bastardised version consequent upon such a\r\ngrant. {519} Supporters signify some definite honour which cannot\r\nordinarily survive illegitimacy.\r\n\r\nThe bordure wavy is placed round the pronominal arms only, and no right to\r\nany quarterings the family may have enjoyed previously is conferred, except\r\nsuch right to a quarterly coat as might ensue through the assumption of a\r\ndouble name. Quartering is held to signify representation which cannot be\r\ngiven by a Royal Licence, but a quartering of augmentation or a duplicate\r\ncoat for the pronominal name which had been so regularly used with the\r\nalternative coat as to constitute the two something in the nature of a\r\ncompound coat, would be exemplified \"all within a bordure wavy.\" Each\r\nillegitimate coat stands on its own basis, and there is a well-known\r\ninstance in which a marriage was subsequently found to be illegal, or to\r\nhave never taken place, after which, I believe, some number of brothers and\r\nsisters obtained Royal Licences and exemplifications. The descendants of\r\none of the brothers will be found in the current Peerage Books, and those\r\nwho know their peerage history well will recognise the case I allude to.\r\nAll the brothers and sisters had the same arms exemplified, each with a\r\nbordure wavy _of a different colour_. If there were descendants of any of\r\nthe sisters, those descendants would have been entitled to quarter the\r\narms, because the illegitimacy made each sister an heiress for heraldic\r\npurposes. This is a curious anomaly, for had they been legitimate the\r\ndescendants would have enjoyed no such right.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the mark of illegitimacy for the arms is the bordure compony,\r\nwhich is usually but not always indicative of the same. The bordure\r\ncounter-compony has been occasionally stated to have the same character.\r\nThis is hardly correct, though it may be so in a few isolated cases, but\r\nthe bordure chequy has nothing whatever of an illegitimate character. It\r\nwill be noticed that whilst the bordure compony and the bordure\r\ncounter-company have their chequers or \"panes,\" to use the heraldic term,\r\nfollowing the outline of the shield, by lines parallel to those which mark\r\nits contour, the bordure chequy is drawn by lines parallel to and at right\r\nangles to the palar line of the shield, irrespective of its outline. A\r\nbordure chequy must, of course, at one point or another show three distinct\r\nrows of checks.\r\n\r\nThe bastardising of crests even in England is a comparatively modern\r\npractice. I know of no single instance ancient or modern of the kind in\r\nScottish heraldry, though I could mention scores of achievements in which\r\nthe shields carry marks of distinction. This is valuable evidence, for no\r\nmatter how lax the official practice of Scottish armory may have been at\r\none period, the theory of Scottish armory far more nearly approaches the\r\nancient practices and rules of heraldry {520} than does the armory of any\r\nother country. That theory is much nearer the ideal theory than the English\r\none, but unfortunately for the practical purposes of modern heraldic needs,\r\nit does not answer so well. At the present day, therefore, a Scottish crest\r\nis not marked in any way.\r\n\r\nMost handbooks refer to a certain rule which is supposed to exist for the\r\ndifferencing of a coat to denote illegitimacy when the coat is that of the\r\nmother and not the father, the supposed method being to depict the arms\r\nunder a surcoat, the result being much the same as if the whole of the arms\r\nappeared in exaggerated flaunches, the remainder of the shield being left\r\nvacant except for the tincture of the surcoat. As a matter of fact only one\r\ninstance is known, and consequently we must consider it as a new coat\r\ndevised to bear reference to the old one, and not as a regularised method\r\nof differencing for a particular set of circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the rules are to all intents and purposes the same as in\r\nEngland, with the exception of the occasional use of a sinister baton\r\ninstead of a bendlet wavy sinister upon the crest. In Scotland, where Royal\r\nLicences are unknown, it is merely necessary to prove paternity, and\r\nrematriculate the arms with due and proper marks of distinction.\r\n\r\nIt was a very general idea during a former period, but subsequently to the\r\ntime when the bend and bendlet sinister and the bordure were recognised as\r\nin the nature of the accepted marks of bastardy, and when their penal\r\nnature was admitted, that whatever mark was adopted for the purpose of\r\nindicating illegitimacy need only be borne for three generations. Some of\r\nthe older authorities tell us that after that length of time had elapsed it\r\nmight be discarded, and some other and less objectionable mark be taken in\r\nits place. The older writers were striving, consciously or unconsciously,\r\nto reconcile the disgrace of illegitimacy, which they knew, with heraldic\r\nfacts which they also knew, and to reconcile in certain prominent families\r\nundoubted illegitimacy with unmarked arms, the probability being that their\r\nsense of justice and regard for heraldry prompted them to the remark that\r\nsome other mark of distinction _ought_ to be added, whilst all the time\r\nthey knew it never was. The arms of Byron, Somerset, Meinill, and Herbert\r\nare all cases where the marks of illegitimacy have been quietly dropped,\r\nentire reversion being had to the undifferenced original coat. At a time\r\nwhen marks of illegitimacy, both in fact and in theory, were nothing more\r\nthan marks of cadency and difference from the arms of the head of the\r\nhouse, it was no venality of the heralds, but merely the acceptance of\r\ncurrent ideas, that permitted them to recognise the undifferenced arms for\r\nthe illegitimate descendants when there were no legitimate owners from\r\nwhose claim the arms of the others needed {521} to be differentiated, and\r\nwhen lordships and lands had lapsed to a bastard branch. To this fact must\r\nbe added another. The armorial control of the heralds after the days of\r\ntournaments was exercised through the Visitations and the Earl Marshal's\r\nCourt. Peers were never subject to the Visitations, and so were not under\r\ncontrol unless their arms were challenged in the Earl Marshal's Court by\r\nthe rightful owner. The cases that were notorious are cases of the arms of\r\npeers.\r\n\r\nThe Visitations gave the officers of arms greater control over the arms of\r\nCommoners than they had had theretofore, and the growing social opinions\r\nupon legitimacy and marriage brought social observances more into\r\nconformity with the technical law, and made that technical law of no\r\ninheritance and no paternity an operative fact. The result is that the hard\r\nlegal fact is now rigidly and rightly insisted upon, and the claim and\r\nright to arms of one of illegitimate descent depends and is made to depend\r\nsolely upon the instruments creating that right, and the conditions of \"due\r\nand proper marks of distinction\" always subject to which the right is\r\ncalled into being. Nowadays there is no release from the penalty of the\r\nbordures wavy and compony save through the avenue of a new and totally\r\ndifferent grant and the full fees payable therefor. But, as the bearer of a\r\nbordure wavy once remarked to me, \"I had rather descend illegitimately from\r\na good family and bear their arms marked than descend from a lot of\r\nnobodies and use a new grant.\" But until the common law is altered, if it\r\never is, the game must be played fairly and the conditions of a Royal\r\nLicence observed, for the sins of the fathers are visited upon the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have refrained from giving any extended list of bastardised\r\ncoats as examples of the rules for indicating illegitimacy, reference may\r\nnevertheless be made to various curious examples.\r\n\r\nThe canton has occasionally been used. Sir John de Warren, a natural son of\r\nJohn, Earl of Surrey, Sussex, and Warenne (d. 1347), bore a canton of the\r\narms of his mother, Alice de Nerford [\"Gules, a lion rampant ermine\"], over\r\nthe chequy shield of Warren. A similar instance can be found in modern\r\ntimes, the arms of Charlton of Apley Castle, co. Salop, being bastardised\r\nby a sinister canton which bears two coats quarterly, these coats having\r\nformerly been quarterings borne in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nThe custom of placing the paternal arms upon a bend has been occasionally\r\nadopted, but this of course is the creation of a _new_ coat. It was\r\nfollowed by the Beauforts before their legitimation, and by Sir Roger de\r\nClarendon, the illegitimate son of the Black Prince. The Somerset family,\r\nwho derived illegitimately from the Beauforts, Dukes of Somerset, first\r\ndebruised the Beaufort arms by {522} a bendlet sinister, but in the next\r\ngeneration the arms were placed upon a wide fess, this on a plain field of\r\nor. Although the Somersets, Dukes of Beaufort, have discarded all signs of\r\nbastardy from their shield, the version upon the fess was continued as one\r\nof the quarterings upon the arms of the old Shropshire family of Somerset\r\nFox. One of the most curious bastardised coats is that of Henry Fitz-Roy,\r\nDuke of Richmond and Somerset, illegitimate son of Henry VIII. This shows\r\nthe Royal Arms within a bordure quarterly ermine and counter-compony or and\r\nazure, debruised by a baton sinister argent, an inescutcheon quarterly\r\ngules and vairé, or and vert [possibly hinting at the Blount arms of his\r\nmother, barry nebuly or and sable], over all a lion rampant argent, on a\r\nchief azure a tower between two stags' heads caboshed argent, attired or.\r\n{523}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE MARSHALLING OF ARMS\r\n\r\nThe science of marshalling is the conjoining of two or more coats of arms\r\nupon one shield for the purpose of indicating sovereignty, dominion,\r\nalliance, descent, or pretension, according to recognised rules and\r\nregulations, by the employment of which the story of any given achievement\r\nshall be readily translatable.\r\n\r\nThe methods of marshalling are (1) dimidiation, (2) impalement, (3)\r\nquartering, (4) superimposition.\r\n\r\nInstances of quartered shields are to be met with possibly before\r\nimpalements or dimidiation. The earliest attempt at anything like a\r\nregularised method of procedure to signify marriage was that usually males\r\n_quartered_ the arms of their wives or ancestresses from whom they acquired\r\ntheir lands; whilst impaled coats were to all intents and purposes the\r\narmorial bearings of married women, or more frequently of widows who took\r\nan immediate interest in their husbands' property. This ancient usage\r\nbrings home very forcibly the former territorial connection of arms and\r\nland. The practice of the husband impaling the wife's arms, whether heiress\r\nor not, probably arose near the close of the fifteenth century. Even now it\r\nis laid down that the arms of a wife should not in general be borne upon\r\nthe husband's banner, surcoat, or official seal.\r\n\r\nBut impalement as we now know it was preceded by dimidiation. Dimidiation,\r\nwhich was but a short-lived method, was effected by the division of the\r\nshield down the centre. On the dexter side was placed the dexter half of\r\nthe husband's arms, and on the sinister side was placed the sinister half\r\nof the wife's arms. With some coats of arms no objection could be urged\r\nagainst the employment of this method. But it was liable to result (_e.g._\r\nwith two coats of arms having the same ordinary) in the creation of a\r\ndesign which looked far more like one simple coat than a conjunction of\r\ntwo. The dimidiation of \"argent, a bend gules\" and \"argent, a chevron\r\nsable\" would simply result in a single coat \"argent, a bend per pale gules\r\nand sable.\" This fault of the system must have made itself manifest at an\r\nearly period, for we soon find it became customary to introduce about\r\ntwo-thirds of {524} the design of each coat for the sake of demonstrating\r\ntheir separate character. It must soon thereafter have become apparent that\r\nif two-thirds of the design of a coat of arms could be squeezed into half\r\nof the shield there was no valid reason why the whole of the design could\r\nnot be employed. This therefore became customary under the name of\r\nimpalement, and the practice has ever since remained with us. Few examples\r\nindeed of dimidiation are to be met with, and as a practical method of\r\nconjunction, the practice was chiefly in vogue during the earlier part of\r\nthe fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nOccasionally quartered coats were dimidiated, in which case the first and\r\nthird quarters of the husband's coat were conjoined with the second and\r\nfourth of the wife's. As far as outward appearance went, this practice\r\nresulted in the fact that no distinction existed from a plain quartered\r\ncoat. Thus the seal of Margaret of Bavaria, Countess of Holland, and wife\r\nof John, Count de Nevers, in 1385 (afterwards Duke of Burgundy), bears a\r\nshield on which is apparently a simple instance of quartering, but really a\r\ndimidiated coat. The two coats to the dexter side of the palar line are: In\r\nchief Burgundy-Modern (\"France-Ancient, a bordure compony argent and\r\ngules\"), and in base Burgundy-Ancient. On the sinister side the coat in\r\nchief is Bavaria (\"Bendy-lozengy argent and azure\"); and the one in base\r\ncontains the quartered arms of Flanders (\"Or, a lion rampant sable\"); and\r\nHolland (\"Or, a lion rampant gules\"); the lines dividing these latter\r\nquarters being omitted, as is usually found to be the case with this\r\nparticular shield.\r\n\r\nCertain examples can be found amongst the Royal Arms in England which show\r\nmuch earlier instances of dimidiation. The arms of Margaret of France, who\r\ndied in 1319, the second queen of Edward I., as they remain on her tomb in\r\nWestminster Abbey, afford an example of this method of conjunction. The\r\narms of England appear on the dexter side of the escocheon; and this coat\r\nundergoes a certain amount of curtailment, though the dimidiation is not\r\ncomplete, portions only of the hindmost parts of the lions being cut off by\r\nthe palar line. The coat of France, on the sinister side, of course does\r\nnot readily indicate the dimidiation.\r\n\r\nBoutell, in his chapter on marshalling in \"Heraldry, Historical and\r\nPopular,\" gives several early examples of dimidiation. The seal of Edmond\r\nPlantagenet, Earl of Cornwall (d. 1300), bears his arms (those of Richard,\r\nEarl of Cornwall, and King of the Romans) dimidiating those of his wife,\r\nMargaret de Clare. Here only the sinister half of his bordure is removed,\r\nwhile the Clare coat (\"Or, three chevrons gules\") is entirely dimidiated,\r\nand the chevrons are little distinguishable from bends. Both coats are\r\ndimidiated in other examples mentioned {525} by Boutell, viz. William de\r\nValence and his wife, and Alianore Montendre and her husband Guy Ferre. On\r\nthe seal of Margaret Campbell, wife of Alexander Napier, in 1531, the\r\nshield shows upon the dexter side the arms of Lennox, and on the sinister\r\nthe dimidiated coat (the sinister half of the quartered arms) of Campbell\r\nand Lorn. This results in the galley of Lorn being in chief, and the\r\nCampbell gyrons in base.\r\n\r\nAn early and interesting Irish example of this kind of marshalling is\r\nafforded by a dimidiated coat of Clare and Fitzgerald, which now figures on\r\nthe official seal of the Provosts of Youghal (Clare: \"Or, three chevrons\r\ngules.\" Fitzgerald: \"Argent, a saltire gules, with a label of five points\r\nin chief\"). Both these coats are halved. They result from the marriage of\r\nRichard Clare, Earl of Hertford, with Juliana, daughter and heir of Maurice\r\nFitzgerald, feudal lord of Inchiquin and Youghal.\r\n\r\nAn even more curious case of dimidiation comes to light in the arms\r\nformerly used by the Abbey of St. Etienne at Caen, in which the arms of\r\nEngland and those attributed to the Duchy of Normandy (\"Gules, two lions\r\npassant guardant or\") were dimidiated, so that in the former half three of\r\nthe fore-quarters of the lions appear, while in the sinister half only two\r\nof the hind-quarters are represented.\r\n\r\nDimidiation was not always effected by conjunction down the palar line,\r\nother partition lines of the shield being occasionally, though very rarely,\r\nemployed in this manner.\r\n\r\nCertain curious (now indivisible) coats of arms remain which undoubtedly\r\noriginated in the dimidiation of two separate coats, _e.g._ the arms of\r\nYarmouth, Sandwich, Hastings, Rye, and Chester. In all cases some Royal\r\nconnection can be traced which has caused the Royal Arms of England to be\r\nconjoined with the earlier devices of fish, ships, or garbs which had been\r\nemployed by the towns in question. It is worth the passing thought,\r\nhowever, whether the conjoined lions and hulks used by the Cinque Ports may\r\nnot originally have been a device of the Sovereign for naval purposes, or\r\npossibly the naval version of the Royal Arms (see page 182).\r\n\r\nOne other remainder from the practice of dimidiation still survives amongst\r\nthe presently existing rules of heraldry. It is a rule to which no modern\r\nauthoritative exception can be mentioned. When a coat within a bordure is\r\nimpaled with another coat, the bordure is not continued down the centre of\r\nthe shield, but stops short at top and bottom when the palar line is\r\nreached. This rule is undoubtedly a result of the ancient method of\r\nconjunction by dimidiation, but the curious point is that, at the period\r\nwhen dimidiation was employed and during the period which followed, some\r\nnumber of examples can be {526} found where the bordure is continued round\r\nthe whole coat which is within it.\r\n\r\nThe arms of man and wife are now conjoined according to the following\r\nrules:--If the wife is not an heraldic heiress the two coats are impaled.\r\nIf the wife be an heraldic heir or coheir, in lieu of impalement the arms\r\nof her family are placed on an inescutcheon superimposed on the centre of\r\nher husband's arms, the inescutcheon being termed an escutcheon of\r\npretence, because _jure uxoris_ she being an heiress of her house, the\r\nhusband \"pretends\" to the representation of her family.\r\n\r\nFor heraldic purposes it therefore becomes necessary to define the terms\r\nheir and heiress. It is very essential that the point should be thoroughly\r\nunderstood, because quarterings other than those of augmentation can only\r\nbe inherited from or through female ancestors who are in themselves heirs\r\nor coheirs (this is the true term, or, rather, the ancient term, though\r\nthey are now usually referred to colloquially as heiresses or coheiresses)\r\nin blood, or whose issue subsequently become in a later generation the\r\nrepresentatives of any ancestor in the male line of that female ancestor. A\r\nwoman is an \"heir\" or \"heiress\" (1) if she is an only child; (2) if all her\r\nbrothers die without leaving any issue to survive, either male or female;\r\n(3) she becomes an heiress \"in her issue,\" as it is termed, if she die\r\nleaving issue herself if and when all the descendants male and female of\r\nher brothers become absolutely extinct. The term \"coheir\" or \"coheiress\" is\r\nemployed in cases similar to the foregoing when, instead of one daughter,\r\nthere are two or more.\r\n\r\nNo person can be \"heir\" or \"coheir\" of another person until the latter is\r\ndead, though he or she may be heir-apparent or heir-presumptive. Though the\r\nword \"heir\" is frequently used with regard to material matters, such usage\r\nis really there incorrect, except in cases of intestacy. A person\r\nbenefiting under a will is a legatee of money, or a devisee of land, and\r\nnot an heir to either. The table on page 527 may make things a little\r\nclearer, but in the following remarks intestacy is ignored, and the\r\nexplanations apply solely to _heirship of blood_.\r\n\r\nCharles in the accompanying pedigree is, after 1800, _heir_ of David.\r\nThomas is _heir-apparent_ of Charles, being a son and the eldest born. He\r\ndies _v.p._ (_vita patris_, _i.e._ in the lifetime of his father) and never\r\nbecomes heir. A daughter can never become an heir-apparent, as there is\r\nalways, during the lifetime of her father, the possibility of a son being\r\nborn. Mary, Ellen, and Blanche are coheirs of Thomas their father, whom\r\nthey survive, and they are also coheirs of their grandfather Charles, to\r\nwhom they succeed, and they would properly in a pedigree be described as\r\nboth. They are heirs-general of Thomas, Charles, and David, and, being the\r\nheirs of the senior line, they are heirs-general or coheirs-general of\r\ntheir house. David being possessed of the barony \"by writ\" of Cilfowyr, it\r\nwould \"fall into abeyance\" at the death of Charles between the three\r\ndaughters equally.\r\n\r\n{527}\r\n\r\n               DAVID CILFOWYR, created Duke of London\r\n               in the Peerage of the United Kingdom,\r\n               remainder to him and the heirs male of his body,\r\n               was Earl of Edinburgh in the Peerage of Scotland\r\n               (with remainder to his heirs), and Lord Cilfowyr\r\n               by writ in the Peerage of England\r\n               (with remainder to his heirs-general).

If the family were an\r\nuntitled Scottish family entitled to supporters, these would descend to\r\nMary unless they had been specifically granted with some other limitation.\r\n\r\nAt the death of Thomas in 1830 Edmond becomes heir male apparent, and at\r\nthe death of his father in 1840 Edmond becomes heir male of his house until\r\nhis death. David having been created a peer (Duke of London) with remainder\r\nto the heirs male of his body, Edmond succeeded as Duke of London at the\r\ndeath of Charles in 1840. Grace and Muriel are coheirs of Edmond after his\r\ndeath. They are _not_ either coheirs or heirs-general of Charles, in spite\r\nof the fact that their father was his heir male. At the death of Charles in\r\n1840, when Edmond succeeded as heir male, John succeeded as heir male\r\npresumptive to Edmond. He was not heir-apparent, because a son might at any\r\nmoment have been born to Edmond. An heir-apparent and an heir-presumptive\r\ncannot exist at the same time, for whilst there is an heir-apparent there\r\ncannot be an heir-presumptive. John succeeded as heir male of his house,\r\nand therefore as Duke of London, in 1850, at the death of his elder brother\r\nEdmond; but, though John was the \"heir male\" of his said elder brother, he\r\nwas _not_ his \"heir\" (Grace and Muriel being the coheirs of Edmond), nor\r\nwas he the \"heir male of the body\" of Edmond, not being descended from him.\r\nJohn, however, was \"heir male of the body\" of Charles. George is\r\nheir-apparent of John until his death in 1870, when George succeeds as\r\n\"heir\" of his father and heir male of his house, and consequently Duke of\r\nLondon. At his death in 1880 Dorothy becomes the \"sole heir,\" or, more\r\nproperly, the \"sole heir-general,\" of her father George; but his kinsman\r\nRobert becomes his \"heir male,\" and therefore Duke of London, in spite of\r\nthe fact that there was a much nearer male relative, viz. a nephew, Arthur,\r\nthe son of his sister. Robert also becomes the heir male of the body of\r\nOwen and heir male of his house, and as such Duke of London. He would also\r\nbe generally described as the heir male of the body of David.\r\n\r\nAt the death of Dorothy in 1885 her coheirs were her aunt Alice and her\r\ncousin Arthur equally, and though these really were the coheirs {529} of\r\n_Dorothy_ (the claims of Alice and Annie being equal, and the rights of\r\nAnnie having devolved upon Arthur), they would more usually be found\r\ndescribed as the coheirs of George or of John. Annie was never _herself_\r\nreally a coheir, because she died before her brother, but \"in her issue\"\r\nshe became the coheir of Dorothy, though she would, after 1885, be usually\r\ndescribed as \"in her issue\" a coheir of George, or possibly even of John,\r\nthough this would be an inexact description. Arthur was heir of his mother\r\nafter 1870, heir of his father after 1872, and heir-apparent of his father\r\nbefore that date; after 1885 he is a coheir of Dorothy, and after 1887 sole\r\nheir of Dorothy and sole heir of Alice. He would also be usually described\r\nas heir-general of George, and heir-general of John. Let us suppose that\r\nJohn had married Edith Torkington, an English baroness (_suo jure_) by writ\r\n(Baroness Neville), who had died in 1862. At that date the barony would\r\nhave descended to her eldest son George until his death in 1880, when\r\nDorothy, _suo jure_, would have succeeded. At her death in 1885 the barony\r\nwould have fallen into abeyance between Alice and Arthur. At the death of\r\nAlice in 1887 the abeyance would be at an end, and the barony in its\r\nentirety would have devolved upon Arthur, who would have enjoyed it until\r\nat his death in 1888 the barony would have again fallen into abeyance\r\nbetween Maria, Jane, and Hannah equally. It is not unlikely that Her\r\nMajesty might have \"determined the abeyance,\" or \"called the barony out of\r\nabeyance\" (the meanings of the terms are identical) in favour of Maria, who\r\nwould consequently have enjoyed the barony in its entirety. At her death in\r\n1889 it would again fall into abeyance between Jane and Hannah. At Jane's\r\ndeath in 1890 Hannah became sole heir, and the abeyance came to an end when\r\nHannah succeeded to the barony. At her death it would pass to her aunt\r\nLilian. Hannah would usually be described as \"coheir and subsequently sole\r\nheir of\" Arthur. If the Baroness Neville had been possessed of an ancient\r\nScottish Peerage (the Earldom of Torkington) it would have passed\r\nundividedly and in full enjoyment to the heir of line, _i.e._ in 1862 to\r\nGeorge, 1880 to Dorothy, 1885 to Alice, 1887 to Arthur, 1888 to Maria, 1889\r\nto Jane, 1890 to Hannah, and 1896 to Lilian, the last (shown on the\r\npedigree) in remainder. Lilian does not become an heiress until 1896, when\r\nthe whole issue of her brother becomes extinct. Irene and Isabel never\r\nbecome heirs at all.\r\n\r\nRobert, as we have seen, became heir male of his house and Duke of London\r\nin 1880. At his death (1896) Harriet becomes sole heir of Robert, but at\r\nher death in 1897 his niece Ada, the only child of his younger brother\r\nPhilip, who had predeceased him, would be usually referred to as heir of\r\nRobert, whilst Cecil is heir male of his house. {530}\r\n\r\nWhen the term \"of the body\" is employed, _actual descent_ from that person\r\nis signified, _e.g._ Arthur after 1885 is \"collateral\" heir-general of\r\nDorothy, but \"heir-general of the body\" of Edith Torkington.\r\n\r\nAn \"heir of entail,\" or, to use the Scottish term, the \"heir of tailzie,\"\r\nis merely the person succeeding to _property_ under a specific remainder\r\ncontained in a deed of entail. This has no relation to heirship in blood,\r\nand the term, from an armorial point of view, might be entirely\r\ndisregarded, were it not that some number of Scottish coats of arms, and a\r\ngreater number of Scottish supporters, and some Scottish peerages and\r\nbaronetcies, are specifically granted and limited to the heirs of entail.\r\nThere are a few similar English grants following upon Royal Licences for\r\nchange of name and arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 742.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 743.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 744.]\r\n\r\nThe term \"heir in expectancy\" is sometimes heard, but it is not really a\r\nproper term, and has no exact or legal meaning. When George was alive his\r\ndaughter Dorothy was his heir-presumptive, but supposing that Dorothy were\r\na Catholic nun and Alice a lunatic, in each of which cases there would be\r\nvery little likelihood of any marriage ever taking place, Arthur would very\r\ngenerally be described as \"heir in expectancy,\" for though he was neither\r\nheir-apparent nor heir-presumptive, all probability pointed to the eventual\r\nsuccession of himself or his issue.\r\n\r\nAnybody is said to be \"in remainder\" to entailed property or a peerage if\r\nhe is included within the recited limits of the entail or peerage. The\r\n\"heir in remainder\" is the person next entitled to succeed after the death\r\nof the existing holder.\r\n\r\nThus (excluding heirs in expectancy and women who are {531}\r\nheirs-presumptive) a marriage with any woman who is an heir or coheir\r\nresults in her arms being placed upon an escutcheon of pretence over the\r\narms of the husband. In the cases of all other women the arms are \"impaled\"\r\nonly. To \"impale two coats\" the shield is divided by a straight line down\r\nthe centre, the whole design of the arms of the husband being placed on the\r\ndexter side of the escutcheon, and the whole design of the wife's arms\r\nbeing placed on the sinister side (Fig. 742).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 745.]\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be as well to here exemplify the different methods of the\r\nconjunction of the arms of man and wife, arranging the same two coats in\r\nthe different methods in which they might be marshalled before reverting to\r\nancient practices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 746.]\r\n\r\nAn ordinary commoner impales his wife's arms as in Fig. 742. If she be an\r\nheiress, he places them on an escutcheon of pretence as in Fig. 743. If the\r\nhusband, not being a Knight, is, however, a Companion of an Order of\r\nKnighthood, this does not (except in the case of the Commanders of the\r\nVictorian Order) give him the right to use the circle of his Order round\r\nhis arms, and his badge is simply hung below the escutcheon, the arms of\r\nthe wife being impaled or placed on an escutcheon of pretence thereupon as\r\nthe case may necessitate. The wife of a Knight Bachelor shares the state\r\nand rank with her husband, and the only difference is in the helmet (Fig.\r\n744). But if the husband be a knight of any order, the ensigns of that\r\norder are personal to himself, and cannot be shared with his wife, and\r\nconsequently two shields are employed. On the dexter shield are the arms of\r\nthe husband with the circle of his order of knighthood, and on the sinister\r\nshield are the arms of the husband impaling the arms of the wife. Some\r\nmeaningless decoration, usually a wreath of oak-leaves, is placed round the\r\nsinister shield to \"balance,\" from the artistic point, the {532} ribbon, or\r\nthe ribbon and collar, as the case may be, of the order of knighthood of\r\nthe husband (Fig. 745). A seeming exception to this rule in the case of the\r\nrecent warrant to Queen Alexandra, whose arms, impaled by those of His\r\nMajesty, are depicted impaled within the Garter, is perhaps explained by\r\nthe fact that Her Majesty is herself a member of that Order. A Knight Grand\r\nCross, of course, adds his collar to the dexter shield, and if he has\r\nsupporters, these are placed outside the _two_ shields.\r\n\r\nA peer impales the arms of his wife as in the case of a commoner, the arms\r\nof the wife being, of course, under the protection of the supporters,\r\ncoronet, and helmet of the peer (Fig. 746). If, in addition to being a\r\npeer, he is also a knight of an order, he follows the rules which prescribe\r\nthe use of two shields as already described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 747.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 748.]\r\n\r\nSupposing the wife to be a peeress in her own right, she cannot nowadays\r\nconfer any rank whatever upon her husband; consequently, if she marry a\r\ncommoner, the husband places her arms upon an escutcheon of pretence\r\nsurmounted by a coronet of her rank, but the supporters belonging to her\r\npeerage cannot be added to his shield. The arms of the wife are\r\nconsequently repeated alone, but in this case upon a lozenge on the\r\nsinister side of the husband's shield. Above this lozenge is placed the\r\ncoronet of her rank, and the supporters belonging to her peerage are placed\r\non either side of the lozenge (Fig. 747). But the arms of a peeress in her\r\nown right are frequently represented on a lozenge without any reference to\r\nthe arms of her husband. In the case of a peeress in her own right marrying\r\na peer, the arms of the peeress are placed upon an escutcheon of pretence\r\nin the centre of {533} her husband's shield, the only difference being that\r\nthis escutcheon of pretence is surmounted by the coronet belonging to the\r\npeerage of the wife; and on the sinister side the arms of the wife are\r\nrepeated upon a lozenge with the supporters and coronet belonging to her\r\nown peerage. It is purely an artistic detail, but it is a happy conceit in\r\nsuch an instance to join together the compartments upon which the two pairs\r\nof supporters stand to emphasise the fact that the whole is in reality but\r\none achievement (Fig. 748).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 749.]\r\n\r\nNow, it is not uncommon to see an achievement displayed in this manner, for\r\nthere have been several instances in recent years of peeresses in their own\r\nright who have married peers. Every woman who _inherits_ a peerage must of\r\nnecessity be an heir or coheir, and, as will have been seen, the laws of\r\narmory provide for this circumstance; but supposing that the peeress were a\r\npeeress by creation and were not an heiress, how would her arms be\r\ndisplayed? Apparently it would not be permissible to place them on an\r\nescutcheon of pretence, and consequently there is no way upon the husband's\r\nshield of showing that his wife is a peeress in her own right. Such an\r\ninstance did arise in the case of the late Baroness Stratheden, who was\r\ncreated a peeress whilst not being an heiress. Her husband was subsequently\r\ncreated Baron Campbell. Now, how were the arms of Lord Campbell and Lady\r\nStratheden and Campbell displayed? I think I am correct in saying that not\r\na single textbook on armory recites the method which should be employed,\r\nand I candidly confess that I myself am quite ignorant upon the point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 750.]\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing are simply instances of how to display the arms of man\r\nand wife, or, to speak more correctly, they are instances of the methods\r\n_in which a man should bear arms for himself and his wife when he is\r\nmarried_; for the helmet and mantling clearly indicate that it is the man's\r\ncoat of arms, and not the woman's. In olden days, when the husband\r\npossessed everything, this might have been enough for all the circumstances\r\nwhich were likely to occur.\r\n\r\nA lady whilst unmarried bears arms on a lozenge (Fig. 749), and upon\r\nbecoming a widow, bears again upon a lozenge the arms of her husband\r\nimpaled with the arms borne by her father (Fig. 750), or with the latter\r\nupon an escutcheon of pretence if the widow be herself an {534} heiress\r\n(Fig. 751). The widow of a knight has no way whatever of indicating that\r\nher husband was of higher rank than an ordinary untitled gentleman. The\r\nwidow of a baronet, however, places the inescutcheon with the hand of\r\nUlster upon her husband's arms (Fig. 752). I have often heard this\r\ndisputed, but a reference to the Grant Books at the College of Arms (_vide_\r\na grant of arms some years ago to Lady Pearce) will provide the necessary\r\nprecedent. If, however, the baronetcy is of Nova Scotia, this means of\r\nindicating the rank cannot be employed. The widow of a peer (not being a\r\npeeress in her own right) uses a lozenge of her husband's and her own arms,\r\nwith his supporters and his coronet (Fig. 753).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 751.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 752.]\r\n\r\nIf a peeress, after marriage with a commoner, becomes a widow she bears on\r\nthe dexter side a lozenge of her late husband's arms and superimposed\r\nthereupon her own on an escutcheon of pretence surmounted by a coronet.\r\n(The coronet, it should be noted, is over the escutcheon of pretence and\r\nnot above the lozenge.) On the sinister side she bears a lozenge of her own\r\narms alone with her supporters and with her coronet above the lozenge. The\r\narms of the present Baroness Kinloss would show an example of such an\r\narrangement of two lozenges, but as Lady Kinloss does not possess\r\nsupporters these additions could not be introduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 753.]\r\n\r\nThe laws of arms provide no way in which a married woman (other than a\r\npeeress in her own right) can display arms in her own right during the\r\nlifetime of her husband, unless this is to be presumed from the method of\r\ndepicting the arms of a wife upon a hatchment. In such a case, a _shield_\r\nis used, usually suspended from a ribbon, identical with the shield of the\r\nhusband, but omitting the helmet, crest, mantling, and motto.\r\n\r\nImpalement is used occasionally in other circumstances than marriage,\r\n_i.e._ to effect conjunction of official and personal arms.\r\n\r\nWith rare exceptions, the official arms which exist are those of\r\nArchiepiscopal and Episcopal Sees, of the Kings of Arms, and of the {535}\r\nRegius Professors at Cambridge. Here certainly, in the ecclesiastical\r\ncases, the theory of marriage remains, the official arms being placed on\r\nthe dexter side and the personal arms on the sinister, inasmuch as the laws\r\nof armory for ecclesiastics were made at a time when the clergy were\r\ncelibate. The personal helmet and crest are placed above the impaled coat,\r\nexcept in the cases of bishops and archbishops, who, of course, use a mitre\r\nin place thereof. It is not correct to impale the arms of a wife upon the\r\nsame shield which carries the impalement of an official coat of arms,\r\nbecause the wife does not share the office. In such a case it is necessary\r\nto make use of two shields placed side by side, as is done in conjoining\r\nthe arms of a Knight of any Order with those of his wife.\r\n\r\nIn impaling the arms of a wife, it is not correct to impale more than her\r\npronominal coat. This is a definite rule in England, somewhat modified in\r\nScotland, as will be presently explained. Though it has never been\r\nconsidered good form to impale a quartered shield, it is only recently that\r\nthe real fact that such a proceeding is definitely incorrect has come to\r\nlight. It appears from the State Papers, Domestic Series, Eliz. xxvi. 31,\r\n1561:--\r\n\r\n\"At a Chapitre holden by the office of Armes at the Embroyderers' Hall in\r\nLondon, anno 4^o Reginæ Elizabethæ it was agreed that no inhiritrix eyther\r\nmayde wife or widow should bear or cause to be borne any Creast or\r\ncognizance of her Ancestors otherwise than as followeth. If she be\r\nunmarried to bear in her ringe, cognizaunce or otherwise, the first coate\r\nof her ancestors in a Lozenge. And during her widowhood to set the first\r\ncoate of her husbande in pale with the first coate of her Auncestors. And\r\nif she mary on who is noe gentleman, then she to be clearly exempted from\r\nthe former conclusion.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst this rule holds in England, it must, to a certain extent, be\r\nmodified in relation to the arms of a Scottish wife. Whilst the inalienable\r\nright _to quarter arms derived_ from an heiress cannot be said to be\r\nnon-existent in Scotland, it should be noted that the custom of\r\nindiscriminately quartering is much less frequent than in England, and\r\ncomparatively seldom adopted, unless estates, or chief representation in an\r\nimportant or appreciable degree, follow the technical heraldic\r\nrepresentation. In England the claim is always preferred to quarter the\r\narms of an ancestress who had no brothers whether she transmitted estates\r\nor not. Of course, technically and theoretically the claim is perfectly\r\ncorrect, and cannot, and should not, be denied. But in practice in England\r\nit has in some cases reached a rather absurd extent, when a man on marrying\r\nan only daughter of the youngest son of the youngest branch of a family\r\nconsequently acquires the right to display with his own ensigns the full\r\narms and quarterings of {536} the head of a house from which he has\r\ninherited no lands, and which is still thriving in the senior male line. In\r\nScottish practice such an event would be ignored, and in that country it is\r\nnot usual to add quarterings to a shield, _nor are these officially\r\nrecognised_ without a rematriculation of the arms. In England it is merely\r\na question of recording the pedigree and proving heirship, and many\r\nquarterings are proved and recorded that there is not the slightest\r\nintention to use regularly. Rematriculation has a more permanent character\r\nthan mere registration, inasmuch as the coat with its quarterings upon\r\nmatriculation as far as usage is concerned becomes indivisible, and,\r\nconsequently, for a Scottish wife the impalement should be of the\r\nindivisible arms and quarterings matriculated to her father in Lyon\r\nRegister, with his bordure and other \"difference\" marks.\r\n\r\nAll the old armorists provide ways of impaling the arms of several wives,\r\nand consequently the idea has grown up that it is permissible and correct\r\nto bear and use the arms of two wives at the same time. This is a mistake,\r\nbecause, strictly and technically speaking, the right to impale the arms of\r\na wife ceases at her death. Impalement means marriage, and when the\r\nmarriage is dissolved the impalement becomes meaningless, and should be\r\ndiscontinued. A man cannot be married to two people at one time, nor can he\r\nas a consequence impale two coats of arms at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe matter is more clearly apparent if the question of an escutcheon of\r\npretence be considered in place of an impalement. The escutcheon of\r\npretence means that the husband _pretends_ to represent the family of his\r\nwife. This _jure uxoris_ he undoubtedly does whilst she is alive, but the\r\nmoment she dies the _actual_ representation of her family passes to her son\r\nand heir, and it is ridiculous for her husband to _pretend_ to represent\r\nwhen there is an undoubted representative in existence, and when the\r\nrepresentation, such as it was when vested in himself, has come to an end,\r\nand passed elsewhere. If his heiress-wife had been a peeress, he would have\r\nborne her escutcheon of pretence surmounted by her coronet; but it is\r\nridiculous for him to continue to do so when the right to the coronet and\r\nto the peerage has passed to his wife's heir. The same argument holds good\r\nwith regard to impalement. That, of course, raises the point that in every\r\nauthority (particularly in those of an earlier period) will be found\r\ndetails of the methods to be adopted for impaling the arms of several\r\nwives. People have quite failed to appreciate the object of these rules.\r\nArmory from its earliest introduction has had great memorial use, and when\r\na monument or hatchment is put up to a man it has been usual, prior to\r\nthese utilitarian days of funeral reform, to memorialise _all_ the wives he\r\nhas been possessed of. In the same way, in a pedigree it is necessary to\r\n{537} enumerate the names and arms of all the wives of a man. Consequently\r\nfor tombs and pedigrees--when all being dead, there is no reason to\r\nindicate any particular woman as the present _wife_--plans have been\r\ndevised for the combination of several coats into one memorial achievement,\r\nplans necessitated by the circumstances of the cases, and plans to which no\r\nobjection can be taken. Tombs, pedigrees, and other memorials are the usual\r\nform in which the records of arms have chiefly come down to us, and from\r\nthe frequency in which cases of achievements with double impalements have\r\nbeen preserved, a mistaken idea has arisen that it is correct to bear, and\r\nactually use and carry, two impalements at one and the same time. Outside\r\nmemorial instances, I have utterly failed to find any instance in former\r\ndays of a man himself using in his own lifetime two impalements, and I\r\nbelieve and state it to be absolutely incorrect for a man to use, say on a\r\ncarriage, a bookplate, or a seal, the arms of a deceased wife. You may\r\n_have been_ married to a presently deceased woman, therefore impale her\r\narms in a record or memorial; but no one _is_ married to a deceased woman,\r\ntherefore it is wrong to advertise that you are married to her by impaling\r\nher arms; and as you cannot be married to two people at the same time, it\r\nis illogical and wrong to _use_ or carry two impalements. I know of no\r\ninstance of a grant to a man of arms to bear in right of a deceased wife.\r\nIt is for these occasions of memorial and record that methods have been\r\ndevised to show a man's marriage with several wives. They certainly were\r\nnot devised for the purpose of enabling him to bear and use for\r\ncontemporary purposes the arms of a series of dead women, the\r\nrepresentation of whom is no longer vested in himself.\r\n\r\nWhilst admitting that for the purposes of record or memorial rules _do_\r\nexist, it should at the same time be pointed out that even for such\r\noccasions it is much more usual to see two shields displayed, each carrying\r\nits separate impalement, than to find two impalements on one shield. The\r\nuse of a separate shield for each marriage is the method that I would\r\nstrongly advocate, but as a knowledge of past observances must be had\r\nfully, if one is to read aright the records of the tombs, I recite what the\r\nrules are:--\r\n\r\n(1) _To impale the arms of two wives._--Either the husband's arms are\r\nplaced in the centre, with the first wife on the dexter and the second wife\r\non the sinister, or else the husband's arms are placed on the dexter side,\r\nand the sinister side is divided in fess, the arms of the first wife being\r\nplaced in chief and those of the second in base. The former method is the\r\none more generally employed of the two.\r\n\r\n(2) _Three wives._--Husband's arms in centre, first wife's on dexter side,\r\nsecond wife's on sinister side in chief, and third wife in base. {538}\r\n\r\n(3) _Four wives._--Husband's in centre, first and second wives' in chief\r\nand base respectively on the dexter side, and third and fourth similarly on\r\nthe sinister.\r\n\r\nIf one of two wives be an heiress her arms might be found in pretence and\r\nthe other coat or coats impaled, but it is impossible in such a case to\r\nplace a number to the wife, and it is impossible to display an escutcheon\r\nof pretence for more than one wife, as if the escutcheon of pretence is\r\nremoved from the exact centre it at once ceases to be an escutcheon of\r\npretence. Consequently, if more than one wife be an heiress, separate\r\nescutcheons should be used for each marriage. Plans have been drawn up and\r\napparently accepted providing for wives up to nearly twenty in number, but\r\nno useful purpose will be served by repeating them. A man with more than\r\nfour wives is unusual in this country.\r\n\r\nDivorce nullifies marriage, and both husband and wife must at once revert\r\nto bachelor and maiden achievements respectively.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to deduce any certain conclusions as to the ancient rules\r\nconnected with impalement, for a simple reason which becomes very\r\nnoticeable on an examination of ancient _seals_ and other armorial records.\r\nIn early times there can be no doubt whatever that men did not impale, or\r\nbother about the arms of wives who were not great heiresses. A man bore his\r\nown arms, and he left his father-in-law, or his brother-in-law, to bear\r\nthose of the family with which he had matched. Of course, we find many\r\ncases in which the arms of a wife figure upon the husband's shield, but a\r\ncareful examination of them shows that in practically every case the reason\r\nis to be found in the fact that the wife was an heiress. Husbands were\r\ncalled to Parliament in virtue of the peerages vested in their wives, and\r\nwe cannot but come to the conclusion that whenever one finds use in early\r\ntimes of the arms of a wife, it is due to the fact that the husband was\r\nbearing them not because of his mere marriage, but because he was enjoying\r\nthe estates, or peerage, of his wife.\r\n\r\nFor that reason we find in many cases the arms of the wife borne in\r\npreference to the paternal arms of descent, or meet with them quartered\r\nwith the arms of the husband, and frequently being given precedence over\r\nhis own; and on the analogy of the coats of arms of wives at present borne\r\nwith the wife's surname by the husband under Royal Licence, there can be\r\nlittle doubt that at a period when Royal Licences had not come into regular\r\nvogue the same idea was dominant, and the appearance of a wife's coat of\r\narms meant the assumption of those arms by the husband as his own, with or\r\nwithout the surname of the wife.\r\n\r\nThe connection between name and arms was not then so stereotyped as it is\r\nat present; rather was it a connection between arms and {539} land, and\r\nperhaps more pointedly of arms and a peerage title where this existed, for\r\nthere are many points and many facts which conclusively show that at an\r\nearly period a coat of arms was often considered to have a territorial\r\nlimitation; or perhaps it should be said that, whilst admittedly personal,\r\narms have territorial attributes or connection.\r\n\r\nThis is borne out by the pleadings and details remaining to us concerning\r\nthe Grey and Hastings controversy, and if this territorial character of a\r\ncoat of arms is admitted, together with another characteristic no less\r\nimportant--and certainly equally accepted--that a coat of arms could belong\r\nto but one person at the same time, it must be recognised that the\r\nappearance of a wife's arms on a husband's shield is not an instance of a\r\nsign of mere marriage or anything analogous thereto. But when we turn to\r\nthe arms of women, the condition of affairs is wholly reversed. A woman,\r\nwho of course retained her identity, drew her position from her marriage\r\nand from her husband's position, and from the very earliest period we find\r\nthat whilst a man simply bore his own arms, the wife upon her seal\r\ndisplayed both the arms of her own family and the arms of her husband's.\r\nUntil a much later period it cannot be said to have been ordinarily\r\ncustomary for the husband to bear the arms of his wife unless she were an\r\nheiress, but from almost the beginning of armory the wife conjoined the\r\narms of her husband and herself. But the instances which have come down to\r\nus from an early period of dimidiated or impaled coats are chiefly\r\ninstances of the display of arms by a widow.\r\n\r\nThe methods of conjunction which can be classed as above, however, at first\r\nseem to have been rather varied.\r\n\r\nOriginally separate shields were employed for the different coats of arms,\r\nthen dimidiated examples occur; at a later period we find the arms impaled\r\nupon one shield, and at a subsequent date the escutcheon of pretence comes\r\ninto use as a means of indicating that the wife was an heiress.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this escutcheon is easy to understand. Taking arms to have a\r\nterritorial limitation--a point which still finds a certain amount of\r\nacceptance in Scottish heraldry--there was no doubt that a man, in\r\nsucceeding to a lordship in right of his wife, would wish to bear the arms\r\nassociated therewith. He placed them, therefore, upon his own, and arms\r\nexclusively of a territorial character have certainly very frequently been\r\nplaced \"in pretence.\" His own arms he would look upon as arms of descent;\r\nthey consequently occupied the field of his shield. The lordship of his\r\nwife he did not enjoy through descent, and consequently he would naturally\r\nincline to place it \"in pretence,\" and from the constant occasions in which\r\nsuch a proceeding would seem to be the natural course of events (all of\r\nwhich occasions {540} would be associated with an heiress-wife), one would\r\nbe led to the conclusion that such a form of display indicated an\r\nheiress-wife; and consequently the rule deduced, as are all heraldic rules,\r\nfrom past precedents became established.\r\n\r\nIn the next generation, the son and heir would have descent from his mother\r\nequally with his father, and the arms of her family would be equally arms\r\nof descent to him, and no longer the mere territorial emblem of a lordship.\r\nConsequently they became on the same footing as the arms of his father. The\r\nson would naturally, therefore, quarter the arms. The escutcheon of\r\npretence being removed, and therefore having enjoyed but a temporary\r\nexistence, the association thereof with the heiress-wife becomes emphasised\r\nin a much greater degree.\r\n\r\nThis is now accepted as a definite rule of armory, but in reciting it as a\r\nrule it should be pointed out, first, that no man may place the arms of his\r\nwife upon an escutcheon of pretence during the lifetime of her father,\r\nbecause whilst her father is alive there is always the opportunity of a\r\nre-marriage, and of the consequent birth of a son and heir. No man is\r\ncompelled to bear arms on an escutcheon of pretence, it being quite correct\r\nto impale them merely to indicate the marriage--if he so desires. There are\r\nmany cases of arms which would appear meaningless and undecipherable when\r\nsurmounted by an escutcheon of pretence.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes, also (says Guillim), he who marries an heretrix may carry her\r\narms in an inescutcheon upon his own, because the husband pretends that his\r\nheirs shall one day inherit an estate by her; it is therefore called an\r\nescutcheon of pretence; but this way of bearing is not known abroad upon\r\nthat occasion.\"\r\n\r\nA man on marrying an heiress-wife has no great space at his disposal for\r\nthe display of her arms, and though it is now considered perfectly correct\r\nto place any number of quarterings upon an escutcheon of pretence, the\r\nopportunity does not in fact exist for more than the display of a limited\r\nnumber. In practice, three or four are as many as will usually be found,\r\nbut theoretically it is correct to place the whole of the quarterings to\r\nwhich the wife is entitled upon the escutcheon of pretence.\r\n\r\nTwo early English instances may be pointed out in the fifteenth century, in\r\nwhich a husband placed his wife's arms _en surtout_. These are taken from\r\nthe Garter Plates of Sir John Neville, Lord Montagu, afterwards Marquess of\r\nMontagu (elected K.G. _circa_ 1463), and of Richard Beauchamp, fifth Earl\r\nof Warwick and Albemarle (elected K.G. _circa_ 1400); but it was not until\r\nabout the beginning of the seventeenth century that the regular practice\r\narose by which the husband of an heiress places his wife's arms in an\r\nescutcheon _en surtout_ {541} upon his personal arms, whether his coat be a\r\nquartered one or not. Another early instance is to be found in Fig. 754,\r\nwhich is interesting as showing the arms of both wives of the first Earl of\r\nShrewsbury. His first was _suo jure_ Baroness Furnivall. Her arms are,\r\nhowever, impaled. His second wife was the daughter (but not the heir) of\r\nRichard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, but she was coheir of her mother, the\r\nBaroness Lisle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    FIG. 754.--Arms of John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, K.G.: Quarterly, 1\r\n    and 4, gules, a lion rampant within a bordure engrailed or (Talbot); 2\r\n    and 3, argent, two lions passant in pale gules (Strange); impaling the\r\n    arms of his first wife whose Peerage he enjoyed, viz.: quarterly, 1 and\r\n    4, argent, a bend between six martlets gules (Furnival); 2 and 3, or, a\r\n    fret gules (Verdon); and upon an escutcheon of pretence the arms of the\r\n    mother of his second wife (to whom she was coheir, conveying her\r\n    mother's Peerage to her son), viz.: 1 and 4, gules, a lion passant\r\n    guardant argent, crowned or (Lisle); 2 and 3, argent, a chevron gules\r\n    (Tyes). (From MS. Reg. 15, E. vi.)\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that even in Great Britain an inescutcheon _en\r\nsurtout_ does not always mean an heiress-wife. The Earl of Mar and Kellie\r\nbears an inescutcheon surmounted by an earl's coronet for his Earldom of\r\nKellie, and other instances are to be found in the arms of Cumming-Gordon\r\n(see Plate III.), whilst Sir Hector Maclean Hay, Bart., thus bears his\r\npronominal arms over his quarterings in continental fashion. Inescutcheons\r\nof augmentation occur in the arms of the Dukes of Marlborough and\r\nWellington, Lord Newton, and on the shields of Newman, Wolfe, and others.\r\n\r\nUnder the Commonwealth the Great Seals of Oliver Cromwell and his son\r\nRichard, as Protectors, bore a shield of arms: \"Quarterly, 1 and 4, argent,\r\na cross gules (for England); 2. azure, a saltire argent (for Scotland); 3.\r\nazure, a harp or, stringed argent (for Ireland);\" and upon these\r\nquarterings _en surtout_ an escutcheon of the personal arms of Cromwell:\r\n\"Sable, a lion rampant argent.\"\r\n\r\nIn the heraldry of the Continent of Europe it has long been the custom for\r\nan elected sovereign to place his hereditary arms in an escutcheon _en\r\nsurtout_ above those of his dominions. As having obtained the crown by\r\npopular election, the Kings of the Hellenes also place _en surtout_ upon\r\nthe arms of the Greek kingdom (\"Azure, a Greek cross couped argent\") an\r\nescutcheon of their personal arms. Another instance is to be found in the\r\narms of the Dukes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Whilst all the descendants of\r\nthe late Prince Consort (other than his Majesty King Edward VII.) bear in\r\nEngland the Royal Arms of this country, differenced by their respective\r\nlabels with an escutcheon of Saxony _en surtout_ as Dukes and Duchesses of\r\nSaxony, the late Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha bore {542} the arms of\r\nSaxony, placing the differenced Royal shield of this country _en surtout_.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the subject of quartering. Considering the fact that every\r\nsingle text-book on armory gives the ordinary rules for the marshalling of\r\nquarterings, it is strange how many mistakes are made, and how extremely\r\nfunny are the ideas of some people upon the subject of quartering. As has\r\nalready been stated, the rules of quartering are governed by the simple,\r\nbut essential and important fact, that every quartering exhibited means the\r\nrepresentation in blood of some particular person. Quarterings, other than\r\nthose of augmentation, can only be inherited from or through those female\r\nancestors who are in themselves heirs or coheirs in blood, or whose issue\r\nsubsequently become in a later generation the representatives of any\r\nancestor in the male line of that said female ancestor. Briefly speaking, a\r\nwoman is an heiress, first, if she is only child; second, if all her\r\nbrothers die without issue in her own lifetime; and third, if the entire\r\nissue, male and female, of her brothers, becomes extinct in her own\r\nlifetime. A woman becomes an \"heiress in her issue,\" as it is termed, if\r\nshe die before her brothers, if and when all the descendants of her\r\nbrothers become absolutely extinct.\r\n\r\nIf the wife be either an heir or coheir, she transmits after her death to\r\n_all_ her children the arms and quarterings--_as quarterings to add to\r\ntheir paternal arms, and as such only_--which she was entitled to place\r\nupon her own lozenge.\r\n\r\nThe origin and theory of quartering is as follows: If the daughter be an\r\nheiress or coheiress she represents either wholly or in part her father and\r\nhis branch of the family, even if \"his branch\" only commenced with himself.\r\nNow in the days when the science of armory was slowly evolving itself there\r\nwas no Married Women's Property Act, and the husband _ipso facto_ became to\r\nall intents and purposes possessed of and enjoyed the rights of his wife.\r\nBut it was at the same time only a possession and enjoyment by courtesy,\r\nand not an actual possession in fee, for the reversion remained with the\r\nwife's heirs, and did not pass to the heirs of the husband; for in cases\r\nwhere the husband or wife had been previously married, or where there was\r\nno issue of their marriage, their heirs would not be identical. Of course\r\nduring the lifetime of his wife he could not actually _represent_ his\r\nwife's family, and consequently could not quarter the arms, but in right of\r\nhis wife he \"pretended\" to the representation of her house, and\r\nconsequently the inescutcheon of her arms is termed an \"escutcheon of\r\npretence.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the death of a wife her children immediately and actually become the\r\nrepresentatives of their mother, and are as such _entitled_ of right to\r\nquarter the arms of their mother's family. {543}\r\n\r\nThe earliest example which has been discovered at the present time of the\r\nuse of a quartered coat of arms is afforded by the seal of Joanna of\r\nPonthieu, second wife of Ferdinand III., King of Castile and Leon, in 1272.\r\nThis seal bears on its reverse in a vesica the triple-towered castles of\r\nCastile, and the rampant lion of Leon, repeated as in the modern\r\nquarterings of Spain. There is, however, no separation of the quarters by a\r\nline of partition. This peculiarity will be also noticed as existing in the\r\nquartered coats of Hainault a quarter of a century later. The quartered\r\ncoat of Castile and Leon remains upon the monument in Westminster Abbey\r\nerected in memory of Eleanor of Castile, who died in 1290, the first wife\r\nof Edward I.\r\n\r\nProviding the wife be an heiress--and for the remainder of this chapter,\r\nwhich deals only with quarterings, this will be assumed--the son of a\r\nmarriage _after the death_ of his mother quarters her arms with those of\r\nhis father, that is, he divides his shield into four quarters, and places\r\nthe arms of his father in the first and fourth quarters, and the arms of\r\nhis mother in the second and third. That is the root, basis, and original\r\nrule of all the rules of quartering, but it may be here remarked, that no\r\nman is entitled to quarter the arms of his mother whilst she is alive,\r\ninasmuch as she is alive to represent herself and her family, and her issue\r\ncannot assume the representation whilst she is alive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    FIG. 755.--Arms of Thomas Stanley, Earl of Derby (d. 1572); Quarterly,\r\n    1. quarterly, i. and iiii., argent, on a bend azure, three bucks' heads\r\n    caboshed or (Stanley); ii. and iii., or, on a chief indented azure,\r\n    three bezants (Lathom); 2 and 3, gules, three legs in armour conjoined\r\n    at the thigh and flexed at the knee proper, garnished and spurred or\r\n    (for the Lordship of Man); 4. quarterly, i. and iiii., gules, two lions\r\n    passant in pale argent (for Strange); ii. and iii., argent, a fess and\r\n    a canton gules (for Wydeville). The arms on the escutcheon of pretence\r\n    are not those of his wife (Anne Hastings), who was not an heiress, and\r\n    they seem difficult to account for unless they are a coat for Rivers or\r\n    some other territorial lordship inherited from the Wydeville family.\r\n    The full identification of the quarterings borne by Anthony, Lord\r\n    Rivers, would probably help in determining the point.\r\n\r\nBut it should not be imagined that the definite rules which exist at the\r\nmoment had any such unalterable character in early times. Husbands are\r\nfound to have quartered the arms of their wives if they were heiresses, and\r\nif important lordships devolved through the marriage. Territorial arms of\r\ndominion were quartered with personal arms (Fig. 755), quarterings of\r\naugmentation were granted, and the present system is the endeavour to\r\nreconcile all the varying circumstances and precedents which exist. One\r\npoint, however, stands out clearly from all ancient examples, viz. that\r\nquartering meant quartering, and a shield was supposed to have but four\r\nquarters upon it. Consequently we find that instead of the elaborate\r\nschemes now in vogue showing {544} 10, 20, 50, or 100 quarterings, the\r\nshield had but four; and this being admitted and recognised, it became\r\nessential that the four most important should be shown, and consequently we\r\nfind that quarterings were selected in a manner which would seem to us\r\nhaphazard. Paternal quarterings were dropped and the result has been that\r\nmany coats of arms are now known as the arms of a family with quite a\r\ndifferent surname from that of the family with which they originated. The\r\nmatter was of little consequence in the days when the \"upper-class\" and\r\narms-bearing families were few in number. Every one knew how Stafford\r\nderived his Royal descent, and that it was not male upon male, so no\r\nconfusion resulted from the Earls of Buckingham giving the Royal coat\r\nprecedence before their paternal quartering of Stafford (see Fig. 756), or\r\nfrom their using only the Woodstock version of the Royal Arms; but as time\r\nwent on the upper classes became more numerous, arms-bearing ancestors by\r\nthe succession of generations increased in number, and while in the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries it would be a physical impossibility\r\nfor any man to have represented one hundred different heiresses of\r\narms-bearing families, in later days such became the case. The result has\r\nbeen the necessity to formulate those strict and rigid rules which for\r\nmodern purposes must be conformed to, and it is futile and childish to\r\ndeduce a set of rules from ancient and possibly isolated examples\r\noriginating in and suitable for the simpler genealogical circumstances of\r\nan earlier day, and assert that it is equally permissible to adopt them at\r\nthe moment, or to marshal a modern shield accordingly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    FIG. 756.--Arms of Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham (d. 1521):\r\n    Quarterly, 1 and 4, quarterly, i. and iiii., France; ii. and iii.,\r\n    England, within the bordure argent of Thomas of Woodstock; 2 and 3, or,\r\n    a chevron gules (for Stafford). (From MS. Add. 22, 306.)\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to break away from the four quarters of a shield was the\r\ninitiation of the system of grand quarters (see Figs. 755 and 756). By this\r\nmeans the relative importance could roughly be shown. Supposing a man had\r\ninherited a shield of four quarters and then married a wife in whom was\r\nvested a peerage, he naturally wished to display the arms connected with\r\nthat peerage, for these were of greater importance than his own four\r\nquarterings. The problem was how to introduce the fifth. In some cases we\r\nfind it borne in pretence, but in other cases, particularly in a later\r\ngeneration, we find that important quarter given the whole of a quarter of\r\nthe shield to itself, the other four being conjoined together and displayed\r\nso as to occupy a similar space. These, therefore, became sub-quarters. The\r\nsystem also had advantages, because it permitted coats which by constant\r\nquartering had become {545} indivisible to be perpetuated in this form. So\r\ndefinite was this rule, that in only one of the series of Garter plates\r\nanterior to the Tudor period is any shield found containing more than four\r\nquarters, though many of these are grand quarters containing other coats\r\nborne sub-quarterly. The one instance which I refer to as an exception is\r\nthe shield of the Duke D'Urbino, and it is quite possible that this should\r\nnot be quoted as an instance in point. He appears to have borne in the\r\nordinary way four quarters, but he subsequently added thereto two\r\nquarterings which may or may not have been one and the same coat of arms by\r\nway of augmentation. These he placed in pale in the centre of the others,\r\nthus making the shield apparently one of six quarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    FIG. 757.--Arms of George Nevill, Baron Abergavenny (d. 1535):\r\n    Quarterly, 1. gules, on a saltire argent, a rose of the field (Nevill);\r\n    2. chequy or and azure (Warenne); 3. or, three chevrons gules (Clare);\r\n    4. quarterly argent and gules, in the second and third quarters a fret\r\n    or, over all a bend sable (Le Despencer); 4. gules, on a fess between\r\n    six cross crosslets or, a crescent sable (for Beauchamp). (Add. MS. 22,\r\n    306.)\r\n\r\nBut one is safe in the assertion that during the Plantagenet period no more\r\nthan four quarters were ordinarily placed upon a shield. Then we come to\r\nthe brief period of \"squeezed in\" quarterings (Figs. 757 and 758). In the\r\nearly Visitations we get instances of six, eight, and even a larger number,\r\nand the start once being made, and the number of four relinquished, there\r\nwas of course no reason why it should not be extended indefinitely. This\r\nappears to have rapidly become the case, and we find that schemes of\r\nquarterings are now proved and recorded officially in England and Ireland\r\nsome of which exceed 200 in number. The record number of officially proved\r\nand recorded quarterings is at present held by the family of Lloyd, of\r\nStockton in Chirbury, co. Salop, but many of the quarterings of this family\r\nare mere repetition owing to constant intermarriages, and to the fact that\r\na single Welsh line of male descent often results in a number of different\r\nshields. Welsh arms did not originally have the hereditary unchangeability\r\nwe are accustomed to in English heraldry, and moreover a large proportion\r\nare later inventions borne to denote descent and are not arms actually used\r\nby those they stand for, so that the recorded scheme {546} of the\r\nquarterings of Mr. Money-Kyrle, or of the sister Countesses of Yarborough\r\nand Powis, respectively Baroness Fauconberg and Conyers and Baroness Darcy\r\nde Knayth are decidedly more enviable. Nobody of course attempts to bear\r\nsuch a number. In Scotland, however, even to the present day, the system of\r\nfour quarterings is still adhered to. The result is that in Scotland the\r\nsystem of grand quarterings is still pursued, whilst in England it is\r\nalmost unknown, except in cases where coats of arms have for some reason or\r\nanother become indivisible. This is a very patent difficulty when it\r\nbecomes necessary to marshal indivisible Scottish coats with English ones,\r\nand the system of cadency adopted in Scotland, which has its chief\r\ncharacteristic in the employment of bordures, makes the matter sometimes\r\nvery far from simple. The system adopted at the present time in the case of\r\na Royal Licence, for example, to bear a Scottish name and arms where the\r\nlatter is a coat of many quarterings within a bordure, is to treat such\r\ncoat as made indivisible by and according to the most recent matriculation.\r\nThat coat is then treated as a grand quartering of an equivalent value to\r\nthe pronominal coat in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    FIG. 758.--Arms of Henry Algernon Percy, Earl of Northumberland (d.\r\n    1527): Quarterly, 1. quarterly, i. and iiii., or, a lion rampant azure\r\n    (Percy); ii. and iii., gules, three lucies haurient argent (Lucy); 2.\r\n    azure, five fusils conjoined in fess or (for Percy); 3. barry of six or\r\n    and vert, a bendlet gules (Poynings); 4. gules, three lions passant in\r\n    pale argent, a bendlet azure (FitzPayne), or three piles azure (Brian).\r\n\r\nBut reverting to the earlier chart, by the aid of which heirship was\r\ndemonstrated, the following were entitled to transmit the Cilfowyr arms as\r\nquarterings. Mary, Ellen, Blanche, Grace, Muriel, and Dorothy all had the\r\nright to transmit. By the death of Dorothy _v.p._ Alice and Annie both\r\nbecame entitled. Maria Jane and Hannah would have been entitled to transmit\r\nSherwin and Cilfowyr, but not Cilfowyr alone, if there had been no arms for\r\nSherwin, though they could have transmitted Sherwin alone if there had been\r\narms for Sherwin and none for Cilfowyr. Harriet would have transmitted the\r\narms of Cilfowyr if she had survived, and Ada would, each subject to\r\ndifferences as has been previously explained.\r\n\r\nAs has been already explained, every woman is entitled to bear upon a\r\nlozenge in her own lifetime the arms, quarterings, and difference marks\r\nwhich belonged to her father. If her mother were an heiress she adds her\r\nmother's arms to her father's, and her mother's quarterings also,\r\nmarshalling the whole into a correct sequence, and placing the said\r\nsequence of quarterings upon a lozenge. Such are the armorial bearings of a\r\ndaughter. If the said daughter be not an heraldic heiress in blood she\r\n_cannot_ transmit either arms or quarterings to her descendants. Needless\r\nto say, no woman, heiress or non-heiress, can now transmit a crest, and no\r\nwoman can bear either crest, helmet, mantling, or motto. A daughter not\r\nbeing an heiress simply confers the right upon her husband to _impale_ upon\r\nhis shield such arms and difference marks as her father bore in his own\r\nright. If an heiress possessing arms marry a man with illegal arms, or a\r\nman making no pretensions to arms, her children have no arms at all, and\r\nreally inherit {547} nothing; and the rights, such as they are, to the arms\r\nof the mother as a quartering remain, and must remain, _dormant_ unless and\r\nuntil arms are established for their father's line, inasmuch as they can\r\nonly inherit armorially from their mother _through_ their father. In\r\nEngland it is always optional for a man to have arms assigned to him to\r\nfill in any blanks which would otherwise mar his scheme of quarterings.\r\n\r\nLet us now see how various coats of arms are marshalled as quarterings into\r\none achievement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 759.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 760.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 761.]\r\n\r\nThe original theory of quartering upon which all rules are based is that\r\nafter a marriage with an heiress, necessitating for the children the\r\ncombination of the two coats, the shield is divided into four quarters.\r\nThese four are numbered from the top left-hand (the dexter) corner (No. 1)\r\nacross towards the sinister (No. 2) side of the shield; then the next row\r\nis numbered in the same way (Nos. 3 and 4). This rule as to the method of\r\nnumbering holds good for any number of quarterings.\r\n\r\nIn allocating the position of the different coats to their places in the\r\nscheme of quarterings, the pronominal coat must _always_ be in the first\r\nquartering.\r\n\r\nIn a simple case (the exceptions will presently be referred to) that places\r\nthe arms of the father in the first and fourth quarters, and the arms of\r\nthe mother in the second and third; such, of course, being on the\r\nassumption that the father possessed only a simple coat without\r\nquarterings, and that the mother was in the same position. The children\r\ntherefore possess a coat of four quarters (Fig. 759). Suppose a son of\r\ntheirs in his turn marries another heiress, also possessing only a simple\r\ncoat without quarterings, he bears arms as Fig. 760, and the grandchildren\r\ndescending from the aforesaid marriage put that last-mentioned coat in the\r\nthird quarter, and the coat, though still of only four quarters, is: 1 and\r\n4, the pronominal coat; 2, the first heiress; 3, the second (Fig. 761).\r\n\r\nIf another single quartering is brought in, in a later generation, that\r\ntakes the place of No. 4. So far it is all plain sailing, but very {548}\r\nfew text-books carry one beyond this point. Another single quartering\r\ninherited gives five quarterings to be displayed on one shield. The usual\r\nplan is to repeat the first quartering, and gives you six, which are then\r\narranged in two rows of three. If the shield be an impaled shield one\r\nsometimes sees them arranged in three rows of two, but this is unusual\r\nthough not incorrect. But five quarterings are sometimes arranged in two\r\nrows, three in the upper and two in the lower, and with a shield of the\r\nlong pointed variety this plan may be adopted with advantage. Subsequent\r\nquarterings, as they are introduced by subsequent marriages, take their\r\nplaces, Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and so on _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\nIn arranging them on one shield, the order in which they devolve (according\r\nto the _pedigree_ and _not_ necessarily according to the _date_ order in\r\nwhich they are inherited) must be rigidly adhered to; but a person is\r\nperfectly at liberty (1) to repeat the _first_ quartering at the end to\r\nmake an even number or not at his pleasure, but no more than the first\r\nquartering must be repeated in such cases; (2) to arrange the quarters in\r\nany number of rows he may find most convenient according to the shape of\r\nthe space the quarterings will occupy.\r\n\r\nUpon the Continent it is usual to specify the number and position of the\r\nlines by which the shield is divided. Thus, while an English herald would\r\nsay simply, _Quarterly of six_, and leave it to the painter's or engraver's\r\ntaste to arrange the quarterings in three rows of two, or in two rows of\r\nthree, a French or German herald would ordinarily specify the arrangement\r\nto be used in distinct terms.\r\n\r\nIf a man possessing only a simple coat of arms without quarterings marry an\r\nheiress with a number of quarterings (_e.g._ say twenty), he himself places\r\nthe arms and quarterings of his wife in pretence. Their children\r\neventually, as a consequence, inherit twenty-one quarterings. The first is\r\nthe coat of their father, the second is the first coat of the mother, and\r\nthe remaining nineteen follow in a regular sequence, according to their\r\nposition upon their mother's achievement.\r\n\r\nTo sum the rule up, it is necessary first to take _all_ the quarterings\r\ninherited from the father and arrange them in a proper sequence, and then\r\nfollow on _in the same sequence_ with the arms and quarterings inherited\r\nfrom the mother.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing explanations should show how generation by generation\r\nquarterings are added to a paternal shield, but I have found that many of\r\nthose who possess a knowledge of the laws to this extent are yet at a loss,\r\ngiven a pedigree, to marshal the resulting quarterings in their right\r\norder.\r\n\r\nGiven your pedigree--the first quartering _must_ be _the pronominal coat_\r\n(I am here presuming no change of name or arms has occurred), which is the\r\ncoat of the strict male line of descent. Then follow this male line back as\r\nfar as it is known. The second quartering is the {549} coat of the _first_\r\nheiress who married your earliest ancestor in the male line who is known to\r\nhave married an heiress. Then after her coat will follow all the\r\nquarterings which she was entitled to and which she has \"brought in\" to\r\nyour family. Having exhausted these, you then follow your male line _down_\r\nto the next heiress, adding her arms as a quartering to those already\r\narranged, and following it by her quarterings. The same plan must be\r\npursued until you arrive at your own name upon the pedigree. Unless some\r\nexceptional circumstance has arisen (and such exceptions will presently be\r\nfound detailed at length), all the quarterings are of equal heraldic value,\r\nand must be the same size when displayed.\r\n\r\nIf after having worked out your quarterings you find that you have more\r\nthan you care to use, you are quite at liberty to make a selection,\r\nomitting any number, _but_ it is entirely _wrong_ to display quarterings\r\nwithout those quarterings which brought them into the paternal line.\r\nSupposing your name to be Brown, you _must_ put the Brown arms in the first\r\nquarter, but at your pleasure you can quarter the arms of each single\r\nheiress who married an ancestor of yours in the male line (_i.e._ who\r\nherself became Mrs. Brown), or you can omit the whole or a part. But\r\nsupposing one of these, Mrs. Brown (_née_ Smith), was entitled to quarter\r\nthe arms of Jones, which arms of Jones had brought in the arms of Robinson,\r\nyou are not at liberty to quarter the arms of Jones without quartering\r\nSmith, and if you wish to display the arms of Robinson you _must_ also\r\nquarter the arms of Jones to bring in Robinson and the arms of Smith to\r\nbring in Robinson and Jones to your own Brown achievement. You can use\r\nBrown only: or quarterly, 1 and 4, Brown; 2 and 3, Smith: or 1 and 4,\r\nBrown; 2. Smith; 3. Jones: or quarterly, 1. Brown; 2. Smith; 3. Jones; 4.\r\nRobinson; but you are _not_ entitled to quarter: 1 and 4, Brown; 2. Jones;\r\n3. Robinson, because Smith, which brought in Jones and Robinson, has been\r\nomitted, and there was never a match between Brown and Jones.\r\n\r\nQuarterings signifying nothing beyond mere representation are not\r\ncompulsory, and their use or disuse is quite optional.\r\n\r\nSo much for the general rules of quartering. Let us now consider certain\r\ncases which require rules to themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for a daughter to be the sole heir or coheir of her mother\r\nwhilst not being the heir of her father, as in the following imaginary\r\npedigree:--\r\n\r\n        _1st wife_\r\n        (an heiress).           _2nd wife._\r\n        MARY CONYERS=JOHN DARCY=MARGARET FAUCONBERG.\r\n                    |          |\r\n        -------------      --------------\r\n        |                  |            |\r\n  JOAN (only daughter),  THOMAS.      HENRY.\r\n  heir of her mother\r\n  but not of her father.\r\n\r\n{550} In this case Joan is not the heir of her father, inasmuch as he has\r\nsons Thomas and Henry, but she is the heir of her mother and the only issue\r\ncapable of inheriting and transmitting the Conyers arms and quarterings.\r\nJoan is heir of her mother but not of her father.\r\n\r\nThe husband of Joan can either impale the arms of Darcy as having married a\r\ndaughter of John Darcy, or he can place upon an escutcheon of pretence arms\r\nto indicate that he has married the heiress of Conyers. But it would be\r\nquite incorrect for him to simply place Conyers in pretence, because he has\r\nnot married a Miss Conyers. What he must do is to charge the arms of\r\nConyers with a dexter canton of the arms of Darcy and place this upon his\r\nescutcheon of pretence.[30] The children will quarter the arms of Conyers\r\nwith the canton of Darcy and inherit likewise all the quarterings to which\r\nMary Conyers succeeded, but the Conyers arms must be always thereafter\r\ncharged with the arms of Darcy on a canton, and no right accrues to the\r\nDarcy quarterings.\r\n\r\nThe following curious, but quite genuine case, which was pointed out to me\r\nby the late Ulster King of Arms, presents a set of circumstances absolutely\r\nunique, and it still remains to be decided what is the correct method to\r\nadopt:--\r\n\r\n     _1st wife._                                   _2nd wife._\r\n   Lady MARY, dau. and = WILLIAM ST.

She is therefore\r\n        entitled to transmit the arms of\r\n        Bermingham with St. Lawrence on\r\n        a canton plus Annesley on a\r\n        canton. Married 1828.\r\n\r\nHow the arms of Bermingham are to be charged with both St. Lawrence and\r\nAnnesley remains to be seen. I believe Ulster favoured {551} two separate\r\ncantons, dexter and sinister respectively, but the point did not come\r\nbefore him officially, and I know of no official decision which affords a\r\nprecedent.\r\n\r\nThe reverse of the foregoing affords another curious point when a woman is\r\nthe heir of her father but not the heir of her mother:--\r\n\r\n                            JOHN SMITH=MARY JONES.\r\n                                      |\r\n            _1st husband._            |     _2nd husband._\r\n             JOHN WILLIAMS = ETHEL SMITH, = HENRY ROBERTS.\r\n                           | only child   |\r\n                           | and heir.    |\r\n         -------------------              -------\r\n         |                                      |\r\n  ALICE WILLIAMS, = ARTHUR ELLIS.         EDWARD ROBERTS,\r\n  only child and  |                       heir of his mother.\r\n  heir of John    |                             |\r\n  Williams.       |                            Issue.\r\n                  |\r\n           THEODORE ELLIS,\r\n        who claims to quarter:\r\n  1 and 4, Ellis; 2. Williams; 3. Smith.\r\n\r\nIt is officially admitted (see the introduction to Burke's \"General\r\nArmory\") that the claim is accurately made. The process of reasoning is\r\nprobably thus. John Williams places upon an escutcheon of pretence the arms\r\nof Smith, and Alice Williams succeeds in her own right to the arms of her\r\nmother because the latter was an heiress, and for herself is entitled to\r\nbear, as would a son, the arms of the two parents quarterly; and having so\r\ninherited, Alice Williams being herself an heiress, is entitled to\r\ntransmit. At any rate Arthur Ellis is entitled to impale or place upon his\r\nescutcheon of pretence Williams and Smith quarterly. To admit the right for\r\nthe descendants to quarter the arms Arthur Ellis so bore is no more than a\r\nlogical progression, but the eventual result appears faulty, because we\r\nfind Theodore Ellis quartering the arms of Smith, whilst the representation\r\nof Smith is in the line of Edward Roberts. This curious set of\r\ncircumstances, however, is rare in the extreme.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens, in devising a scheme of quarterings, that a person\r\nmay represent heiresses of several families entitled to bear arms, but to\r\nwhom the pedigree must be traced through an heiress of another family which\r\ndid not possess arms. Consequently any claim to quarterings inherited\r\nthrough the non-armorial heiress is dormant, and the quarterings must not\r\nbe used or inserted in any scheme drawn up. It is always permissible,\r\nhowever, to petition for arms to be granted to be borne for that\r\nnon-armorial family for the purpose of introducing the quarterings in\r\nquestion, and such a grant having been made, the dormant claim then becomes\r\noperative and the new coat is introduced, followed by the dormant\r\nquartering in precisely the same manner as would have been the case if the\r\narms granted had always existed. Grants of this character are constantly\r\nbeing obtained. {552}\r\n\r\nWhen a Royal Licence to assume or change name and arms is granted it very\r\nconsiderably affects the question of quartering, and many varying\r\ncircumstances attending these Royal Licences make the matter somewhat\r\nintricate. If the Royal Licence is to assume a name and arms in lieu of\r\nthose previously used, this means that for everyday use the arms are\r\n_changed_, the right to the old arms lapsing except for the purpose of a\r\nscheme of quarterings. The new coat of arms under the terms of the Royal\r\nLicence, which requires it first \"to be exemplified in our Royal College of\r\nArms, otherwise this our Royal Licence to be void and of none effect,\" is\r\nalways so exemplified, this exemplification being from the legal point of\r\nview equivalent to a new grant of the arms to the person assuming them. The\r\nterms of the Royal Licence have always carefully to be borne in mind,\r\nparticularly in the matter of remainder, because sometimes these\r\nexemplifications are for a limited period or intended to devolve with\r\nspecified property, and a Royal Licence only nullifies a prior right to\r\narms to the extent of the terms recited in the Letters Patent of\r\nexemplification. In the ordinary way, however, such an exemplification is\r\nequivalent to a new grant affecting all the descendants. When it is assumed\r\nin lieu, for the ordinary purpose of use the new coat of arms takes the\r\nplace of the old one, but the right to the old one remains in theory to a\r\ncertain extent, inasmuch as its existence _is necessary_ in any scheme of\r\nquartering _to bring in_ any quarterings previously inherited, and these\r\ncannot be displayed with the new coat unless they are preceded by the old\r\none. Quarterings, however, which are brought into the family through a\r\nmarriage in the generation in which the Royal Licence is obtained, or in a\r\nsubsequent generation, can be displayed with the new coat without the\r\ninterposition of the old one.\r\n\r\nIf the Royal Licence be to bear the name of a certain family in lieu of a\r\npresent name, and to bear the arms of that family quarterly with the arms\r\npreviously borne, the quarterly coat is then exemplified. In an English or\r\nIrish Royal Licence the coat of arms for the name assumed is placed in the\r\nfirst and the fourth quarters, and the old paternal arms figure in the\r\nsecond and third. This is an invariable rule. The quarterly coat thus\r\nexemplified becomes an indivisible coat for the new name, and it is not\r\npermissible to subsequently divide these quarterings. They become as much\r\none coat of arms as \"azure, a bend or\" is the coat of arms of Scrope. If\r\nthis quarterly coat is to be introduced in any scheme of quarterings it\r\nwill only occupy the same space as any other single quartering and counts\r\nonly as one, though it of course is in reality a grand quartering. In\r\ndevising a scheme of quarterings for which a sub-quarterly coat of this\r\ncharacter exemplified under a Royal Licence is the pronominal coat, that\r\n{553} quarterly coat is placed in the first quarter. Next to it is placed\r\nthe original coat of arms borne as the pronominal coat before the Royal\r\nLicence and exemplified in the second and third sub-quarters of the first\r\nquarter. When here repeated it occupies an entire quarter. Next to it are\r\nplaced the whole of the quarterings belonging to the family in the order in\r\nwhich they occur. If the family whose name has been assumed is represented\r\nthrough an heiress that coat of arms is also repeated in its proper\r\nposition and in that place in which it would have appeared if unaffected by\r\nthe Royal Licence. But if it be the coat of arms of a family from whom\r\nthere is no descent, or of whom there is no representation, the fact of the\r\nRoyal Licence does not give any further right to quarter it beyond its\r\nappearance in the pronominal grand quartering. The exact state of the case\r\nis perhaps best illustrated by the arms of Reid-Cuddon. The name of the\r\nfamily was originally Reid, and representing an heiress of the Cuddons of\r\nShaddingfield Hall they obtained a Royal Licence to take the name and arms\r\nof Cuddon in addition to the name and arms of Reid, becoming thereafter\r\nReid-Cuddon. The arms were exemplified in due course, and the achievement\r\nthen became: Quarterly, 1 and 4, Reid-Cuddon sub-quarterly, 2. the arms of\r\nReid, 3. the arms of Cuddon. In Scotland no such thing as a Royal Licence\r\nexists, the matter being determined merely by a rematriculation following\r\nupon a voluntary change of name. There is no specified order or position\r\nfor the arms of the different names, and the arrangement of the various\r\nquarterings is left to be determined by the circumstances of the case. Thus\r\nin the arms of Anstruther-Duncan the arms of Anstruther are in the first\r\nquarter, and the matter is always largely governed by the importance of the\r\nrespective estates and the respective families. In England this is not the\r\ncase, because it is an unalterable rule that the arms of the last or\r\nprincipal surname if there be two, or the arms of the one surname if that\r\nbe the case when the arms of two families are quartered, must always go in\r\nthe 1st and 4th quarters. If three names are assumed by Royal Licence, the\r\narms of the last name go in the 1st and 4th quarters, and the last name but\r\none in the second quarter, and of the first name in the third. These cases\r\nare, however, rare. But no matter how many names are assumed, and no matter\r\nhow many original coats of arms the shield as exemplified consists of, it\r\nthereafter becomes an indivisible coat.\r\n\r\nWhen a Royal Licence is issued to an illegitimate person to bear the name\r\nand arms of another family, no right is conferred to bear the quarterings\r\nof that family even subject to difference marks. The Royal Licence is only\r\napplicable to whatever arms were the pronominal coat used with the name\r\nassumed. Though instances {554} certainly can be found in some of the\r\nVisitation Books and other ancient records of a coat with quarterings, the\r\nwhole debruised by a bendlet sinister, notably in the case of a family of\r\nTalbot, where eight quarters are so marked, the fact remains that this\r\npractice has long been definitely considered incorrect, and is now never\r\npermitted. If a Royal Licence is issued to an illegitimate woman the\r\nexemplification is to herself personally, for in the eyes of the law she\r\nhas no relatives; and though she may be one of a large family, her\r\ndescendants are entitled to quarter the arms with the marks of distinction\r\nexemplified to her because such quartering merely indicates the\r\nrepresentation of that one woman, who in the eyes of the law stands alone\r\nand without relatives. In the case of a Royal Licence to take a name and\r\narms subject to these marks of distinction for illegitimacy, and in cases\r\nwhere the arms to be assumed are a sub-quarterly coat, the mark of\r\ndistinction, which in England is now invariably a bordure wavy, will\r\nsurround both quarterings, which remain an indivisible coat.\r\n\r\nIf an augmentation is granted to a person whose pronominal coat is\r\nsub-quarterly, that augmentation, whatever form it may assume, is\r\nsuperimposed upon all quarterings. Thus a chief of augmentation would go\r\nacross the top of the shield, the four quarters being displayed below, and\r\nthe whole of this shield would be only one quartering in any scheme of\r\nquartering. An inescutcheon is superimposed over all. If the augmentation\r\ntake the form of a quartering, then the pronominal coat is a grand\r\nquartering, equivalent in size to the augmentation. If a person entitled to\r\na sub-quarterly coat and a double name obtains a Royal Licence to bear\r\nanother name and arms, and to bear the arms he has previously borne\r\nquarterly with those he has assumed, the result would be: Quarterly, 1 and\r\n4, the new coat assumed, quarterly 2 and 3, the arms he has previously\r\nborne sub-quarterly. But it should be noticed that the arrangements of\r\ncoats of arms under a Royal Licence largely depends upon the wording of the\r\ndocument by which authority is given by the Sovereign. The wording of the\r\ndocument in its terms is based upon the wording of the petition, and within\r\nreasonable limits any arrangement which is desired is usually permitted, so\r\nthat care should be taken as to the wording of the petition.\r\n\r\nA quartering of augmentation is always placed in the first quarter of a\r\nshield, but it becomes indivisible from and is depicted sub-quarterly with\r\nthe paternal arms; for instance, the Dukes of Westminster for the time\r\nbeing, but not other members of the family, bear as an augmentation the\r\narms of the city of Westminster in the 1st and 4th quarters of his shield,\r\nand the arms of Grosvenor in the 2nd and 3rd, but this coat of Westminster\r\nand Grosvenor is an indivisible {555} quarterly coat which together would\r\nonly occupy the first quarter in a shield of quarterings. Then the second\r\none would be the arms of Grosvenor alone, which would be followed by the\r\nquarterings previously inherited.\r\n\r\nIf under a Royal Licence a name is assumed and the Royal Licence makes no\r\nreference to the arms of the family, the arms for all purposes remain\r\nunchanged and as if no Royal Licence had ever been issued. If the Royal\r\nLicence issued to a family simply exemplifies a single coat of arms, it is\r\nquite wrong to introduce any other coat of arms to convert this single coat\r\ninto a sub-quarterly one.\r\n\r\nTo all intents and purposes it may be stated that in Scotland there are\r\nstill only four quarters in a shield, and if more than four coats are\r\nintroduced grand quarterings are employed. Grand quarterings are very\r\nfrequent in Scottish armory. The Scottish rules of quartering follow no\r\nfixed principle, and the constant rematriculations make it impossible to\r\ndeduce exact rules; and though roughly approximating to the English ones,\r\nno greater generalisation can be laid down than the assertion that the most\r\nrecent matriculation of an ancestor governs the arms and quarterings to be\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\nA royal quartering is never subdivided.\r\n\r\nIn combining Scottish and English coats of arms into one scheme of\r\nquartering, it is usual if possible to treat the coat of arms as\r\nmatriculated in Scotland as a grand quartering equivalent in value to any\r\nother of the English quarterings. This, however, is not always possible in\r\ncases where the matriculation itself creates grand quarterings and\r\nsub-quarterings; and for a scheme of quarterings in such a case it is more\r\nusual for the Scottish matriculation to be divided up into its component\r\nparts, and for these to be used as simple quarterings in succession to the\r\nEnglish ones, regardless of any bordure which may exist in the Scottish\r\nmatriculation. It cannot, of course, be said that such a practice is beyond\r\ncriticism, though it frequently remains the only practical way of solving\r\nthe difficulty.\r\n\r\nUntil comparatively recent times, if amongst quarterings inherited the\r\nRoyal Arms were included, it was considered a fixed, unalterable rule that\r\nthese should be placed in the first quarter, taking precedence of the\r\npronominal coat, irrespective of their real position according to the date\r\nor pedigree place of introduction. This rule, however, has long since been\r\nsuperseded, and Royal quarterings now take their position on the same\r\nfooting as the others. It very probably arose from the misconception of the\r\nfacts concerning an important case which doubtless was considered a\r\nprecedent. The family of Mowbray, after their marriage with the heiress of\r\nThomas de Brotherton, used either the arms of Brotherton alone, these being\r\nEngland differenced {556} by a label, or else placed them in the first\r\nquarter of their shield. Consequently from this precedent a rule was\r\ndeduced that it was permissible and correct to give a Royal quartering\r\nprecedence over all others. The position of the Mowbrays, Dukes of Norfolk,\r\nas Earls Marshal no doubt led to their own achievement being considered an\r\nexemplary model. But it appears to have been overlooked that the Mowbrays\r\nbore these Royal Arms of Brotherton not as an inherited quartering but as a\r\ngrant to themselves. Richard II. apparently granted them permission to bear\r\nthe arms of Edward the Confessor impaled with the arms of Brotherton, the\r\nwhole between the two Royal ostrich feathers (Fig. 675), and consequently,\r\nthe grant having been made, the Mowbrays were under no necessity to display\r\nthe Mowbray or the Segrave arms to bring in the arms of Brotherton. A\r\nlittle later a similar case occurred with the Stafford family, who became\r\nsole heirs-general of Thomas of Woodstock, and consequently entitled to\r\nbear his arms as a quartering. The matter appears to have been settled at a\r\nchapter of the College of Arms, and the decision arrived at was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n_Cott. MS., Titus, C. i. fol. 404, in handwriting of end of sixteenth\r\ncentury._\r\n\r\n    [An order made for Henry Duke of Buckingham to beare the Armes of\r\n    Thomas of Woodstock alone without any other Armes to bee quartered\r\n    therewith. Anno 13 E 4.]\r\n\r\n    Memorandum that in the yeare of the Reigne of our Soveraign Lord King\r\n    Edward the iiij^{th}, the Thurtein in the xviij^{tin} day of ffeverir,\r\n    it was concluded in a Chapitre of the office of Armes that where a\r\n    nobleman is descended lenyalle Ineritable to iij. or iiij. Cotes and\r\n    afterward is ascended to a Cotte neir to the King and of his royall\r\n    bloud, may for his most onneur bere the same Cootte alone, and none\r\n    lower Coottes of Dignite to be quartered therewith. As my Lord Henry\r\n    Duke of Buckingham, Eirll of Harford, Northamton, and Stafford, Lord of\r\n    Breknoke and of Holdernes, is assended to the Coottes and ayer to\r\n    Thomas of Woodstoke, Duke of Glocestre and Sonne to King Edward the\r\n    third, hee may beire his Cootte alone. And it was so Concluded by\r\n    [Claurancieulx King of Armes, Marche King of Armes, Gyen King of Armes,\r\n    Windesor Herauld, Fawcon Herauld, Harfford Herald].\r\n\r\nBut I imagine that this decision was in all probability founded upon the\r\ncase of the Mowbrays, which was not in itself an exact precedent, because\r\nwith the Staffords there appears to have been no such Royal grant as\r\nexisted with the Mowbrays. Other instances at about this period can be\r\nalluded to, but though it must be admitted that the rule existed at one\r\ntime, it has long since been officially overridden.\r\n\r\nA territorial coat or a coat of arms borne to indicate the possession of a\r\nspecific title is either placed in the first quarter or borne in {557}\r\npretence; see the arms of the Earl of Mar and Kellie. A singular instance\r\nof a very exceptional method of marshalling occurs in the case of the arms\r\nof the Earl of Caithness. He bears four coats of arms, some being stated to\r\nbe territorial coats, quarterly, dividing them by the cross engrailed sable\r\nfrom his paternal arms of Sinclair. The arms of the Earls of Caithness are\r\nthus marshalled: \"Quarterly, 1. azure, within a Royal tressure a ship with\r\nfurled sails all or.\" For Orkney: \"2 and 3. or, a lion rampant gules.\" For\r\nSpar (a family in possession of the Earldom of Caithness before the\r\nSinclairs): \"4. Azure, a ship in sail or, for Caithness\"; and over all,\r\ndividing the quarters, a cross engrailed \"sable,\" for Sinclair. The Barons\r\nSinclair of Sweden (so created 1766, but extinct ten years later) bore the\r\nabove quartered coats as cadets of Caithness, but separated the quarters,\r\nnot by the engrailed cross sable of Sinclair, but by a cross patée\r\nthroughout ermine. In an escutcheon _en surtout_ they placed the Sinclair\r\narms: \"Argent, a cross engrailed sable\"; and, as a mark of cadency, they\r\nsurrounded the main escutcheon with \"a bordure chequy or and gules.\" This\r\narrangement was doubtless suggested by the Royal Arms of Denmark, the\r\nquarterings of which have been for so many centuries separated by the cross\r\nof the Order of the Dannebrog: \"Argent, a cross patée throughout fimbriated\r\ngules.\" In imitation of this a considerable number of the principal\r\nScandinavian families use a cross patée throughout to separate the quarters\r\nof their frequently complicated coats. The quarterings in these cases are\r\noften not indicative of descent from different families, but were all\r\nincluded in the original grant of armorial bearings. On the centre of the\r\ncross thus used, an escutcheon, either of augmentation or of the family\r\narms, is very frequently placed _en surtout_.\r\n\r\nThe main difference between British and foreign usage with regard to\r\nquartering is this, that in England quarterings are usually employed to\r\ndenote simply descent from an heiress, or representation in blood; in\r\nScotland they also implied the possession of lordships. In foreign coats\r\nthe quarterings are often employed to denote the possession of fiefs\r\nacquired in other ways than by marriage (_e.g._ by bequest or purchase), or\r\nthe _jus expectationis_, the right of succession to such fiefs in\r\naccordance with certain agreements.\r\n\r\nIn foreign heraldry the base of the quartered shield is not unfrequently\r\ncut off by a horizontal line, forming what is known as a _Champagne_, and\r\nthe space thus made is occupied by one or more coats. At other times a pile\r\nwith curved sides runs from the base some distance into the quartered\r\nshield, which is then said to be _enté en point_, and this space is devoted\r\nto the display of one or more quarterings. The definite and precise British\r\nregulations which have grown up on the {558} subject of the marshalling of\r\narms have no equivalent in the armorial laws of other countries.\r\n\r\nVery rarely quartering is affected _per saltire_, as in the arms of Sicily\r\nand in a few coats of Spanish origin, but even as regards foreign armory\r\nthe practice is so rare that it may be disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe laws of marshalling upon the Continent, and particularly in Germany,\r\nare very far from being identical with British heraldic practices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 762.--Arms of Hans Wolf von Bibelspurg.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 763.--Arms of Hans Wolf von Bibelspurg and his wife\r\nCatherina Waraus married in 1507 at Augsburg.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 764.]\r\n\r\nThe British method of impaling two coats of arms upon one shield to signify\r\nmarriage is abroad now wholly discarded, and two shields are invariably\r\nmade use of. These shields are placed side by side, the dexter shield being\r\nused to display the man's arms and the sinister those of the woman's\r\nfamily. The shields are tilted towards each other (the position is not\r\nquite identical with that which we term accollé). But--and this is a\r\npeculiarity practically unknown in England--the German practice invariably\r\nreverses the charges upon the dexter shield, so that the charges upon the\r\ntwo shields \"respect\" each other. This perhaps can be most readily\r\nunderstood by reference to Figs. 762 and 763. The former shows the simple\r\narms of Von Bibelspurg, the latter the same coat allied with another. But\r\nit should be noted that letters or words, if they appear as charges upon\r\nthe shield, are not reversed. This reversing of the charges is by no means\r\nan uncommon practice in Germany for other purposes. For instance, if the\r\narms of a State are depicted surrounded by the arms of provinces, or if the\r\narms of a reigning Sovereign are grouped within a bordure of the shields of\r\nother people, the charges on the shields to the dexter are almost\r\ninvariably shown in reflection regarding the shield in the centre. This\r\npractice, resting only on what may be termed \"heraldic courtesy,\" dates\r\nback to very early times, and is met with even in Rolls of Arms where the\r\nshields are all turned to face the centre. Such a system was adopted in\r\nSiebmacher's \"Book of Arms.\" But what the true position of the {559}\r\ncharges should be when represented upon a simple shield should be\r\ndetermined by the position of the helmet. It may be of interest to state\r\nthat in St. George's Chapel at Windsor the early Stall plates as originally\r\nset up were all disposed so that helmets and charges alike faced the High\r\nAltar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 765.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 766.--Arms of Loschau or Lexaw, of Augsburg.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 767.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 768.--Arms of the Elector and Archbishop of Treves.]\r\n\r\nThe conjunction of three coats of arms in Germany is effected as shown in\r\nFig. 764. Although matrimonial alliance does not in Germany entail the\r\nconjunction of different coats of arms on one shield, such conjunction does\r\noccur in German heraldry, but it is comparable (in its meaning) with our\r\nrules of quartering and not with our rules of impalement. No such exact and\r\ndefinite rules exist in that country as are to be met with in our own to\r\ndetermine the choice of a method of conjunction, nor to indicate the\r\nsignificance to be presumed from whatever method may be found in use.\r\nPersonal selection and the adaptability to any particular method of the\r\ntinctures and the charges themselves of the coats to be conjoined seem to\r\nbe the determining factors, and the existing territorial attributes of\r\nGerman armory have a greater weight in marshalling than the principle of\r\nheirship which is now practically the sole governing factor in British\r\nheraldry. One must therefore content oneself with a brief recital of some\r\nof the various modes of conjunction which have been or are still practised.\r\nThese include impalement per pale or per fess (Fig. 765) and dimidiation\r\n(Fig. 766), which is more usual on the Continent than it ever was in these\r\nkingdoms. The subdivision of the field, as with ourselves, is most\r\nfrequently adopted; though we are usually confined to quartering, German\r\narmory knows no such restrictions. The most usual subdivisions are as given\r\nin Fig. 767. The ordinary quartered shield is met with in Fig. 768, which\r\nrepresents the arms of James III., Von Eltz, Elector and Archbishop of\r\nTreves (1567-1581), in which his personal arms of Eltz (\"Per fess gules and\r\nargent, in chief a demi-lion issuing or\") are quartered with the impersonal\r\narms of his archbishopric, \"Argent, a cross gules.\" Another method of\r\nconjunction is superimposition, by which the design of the one shield takes\r\nthe form of an ordinary imposed {560} upon the other (Fig. 769). A curious\r\nmethod of conjoining three coats is by engrafting the third in base (Fig.\r\n770). The constant use of the inescutcheon has been already referred to,\r\nand even early English armory (Figs. 706 and 710) has examples of the\r\nwidespread Continental practice (which obtains largely in Spanish and\r\nPortuguese heraldry) of surrounding one coat with a bordure of another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 769.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 770.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 771.]\r\n\r\nThe German method of conjunction by incorporation has been frequently\r\npleaded in British heraldry, in efforts to account for ancient arms, but\r\nwith us (save for occasional use for cadency differencing at an early and\r\nfor a limited period) such incorporation only results in and signifies an\r\noriginally _new_ coat, and not an authorised marshalling of existing arms\r\nof prior origin and authority. The German method can best be explained by\r\ntwo examples. Let us suppose a coat \"per fess argent and gules,\" with which\r\nanother coat \"gules, a fleur-de-lis argent,\" is to be marshalled. The\r\nresult would be \"per fess argent and gules, a fleur-de-lis counterchanged.\"\r\nWith smaller objects a more usual method would duplicate the charges, thus\r\n\"per bend argent and azure,\" and \"argent, a star of six points azure\" would\r\nresult in \"per bend argent and azure, two stars of six points\r\ncounterchanged\" (Fig. 771). {561}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE ARMORIAL INSIGNIA OF KNIGHTHOOD\r\n\r\nIt hardly falls within the scope of the present work to detail or discuss\r\nthe various points concerning the history or statutes of the different\r\nBritish Orders of Knighthood, and still less so of the Foreign Orders. The\r\nhistory of the English Orders alone would make a bulky volume. But it is\r\nnecessary to treat of the matter to some limited extent, inasmuch as in\r\nmodern heraldry in every country in Europe additions are made to the\r\narmorial achievement whenever it is desired to signify rank in any of the\r\nOrders of Knighthood.\r\n\r\nThough a large number of the early Plantagenet Garter Stall plates date as\r\nfar back as the year 1420, it is evident that nothing in the armorial\r\nbearings with which they are emblazoned bears any relation to the order of\r\nknighthood to which they belonged until the year 1469 or thereabouts, when\r\nCharles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, was elected a Knight of the Garter. His\r\nStall plate, which is of a very exceptional style and character, is the\r\nfirst to bear the garter encircling the shield. It is curious to notice, by\r\nthe way, that upon the privy seal of the Duke of Burgundy, which shows the\r\nsame arms depicted upon his Garter plate, the shield is surrounded by the\r\ncollar, from which depends the badge of the Order of the Golden Fleece, so\r\nthat it is highly probable that the custom of adding marks of knighthood to\r\na shield came to us from the Continent. The next Garter plate, which shows\r\nthe garter around the shield, is that of Viscount Lovel, who was elected in\r\n1483; and the shield of the Earl of Derby, who was elected in the same\r\nyear, also is encircled by the Garter. The Garter itself encircling the\r\nshields of knights of that order remained the only mark of knighthood used\r\narmorially in this country for a considerable period, though we find that\r\nthe example was copied in Scotland soon afterwards with regard to the Order\r\nof the Thistle. At the commencement of the present Lyon Register, which\r\ndates from the year 1672, the arms of the King of Scotland, which are given\r\nas such and not as the King of England and Scotland, are described as\r\nencircled by the collar of the Order of the Thistle. This probably was used\r\nas the equivalent of the garter in England, for we do not find the collar\r\nof the {562} Garter, together with the garter itself, or the ribbon circle\r\nof the Thistle, together with the collar of that order, until a much later\r\nperiod. The use of collars of knighthood upon the Continent to encircle\r\ncoats of arms has been from the fifteenth century very general and\r\nextensive; examples are to be found at an earlier date; but the encircling\r\nof arms with the garter carrying the motto of the order, or with the ribbon\r\n(which is termed the circle) and motto of any other order is an entirely\r\nEnglish practice, which does not appear to have been copied in any other\r\ncountry. It, of course, arose from the fact that the actual garter as worn\r\nby the knight of the order carried the motto of the order, and that by\r\nrepresenting the garter round the shield, the motto of the order was of\r\nnecessity also added. The Lyon Register, however, in the entry of record\r\n(dated 1672), states that the shield is \"encircled with the Order of\r\nScotland, the same being composed of rue and thistles having the image of\r\nSt. Andrew with his crosse on his brest y^runto pendent,\" and it is by no\r\nmeans improbable that occasional instances of the heraldic use of the\r\ncollar of the garter might be discovered at the same period. But it is not\r\nuntil the later part of the eighteenth century that it obtained anything\r\nlike a regular use.\r\n\r\nDuring the Hanoverian period it became customary to encircle the shield\r\nfirst with the garter, and that in its turn with the collar of the order\r\nwhenever it was desired to display the achievement in its most complete\r\nstyle; and though even then, as at the present day, for less elaborate\r\nrepresentations the garter only was used without the collar, it still\r\nremains correct to display both in a full emblazonment of the arms. An\r\nimpetus to the practice was doubtless given by the subdivision of the Order\r\nof the Bath, which will be presently referred to. In speaking of the\r\ngarter, the opportunity should be taken to protest strongly against the\r\nobjectionable practice which has arisen of using a garter to encircle a\r\ncrest or shield and to carry the family motto. No matter what motto is\r\nplaced upon the garter, it is both bad form and absolutely incorrect for\r\nany one who is not a Knight of the Garter to use a garter in any heraldic\r\ndisplay.\r\n\r\nBut to tabulate the existing practice the present rules as to the display\r\nof the arms of knights of the different orders are as follow:--\r\n\r\n_A Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter_ encircles his escutcheon\r\nby a representation of the garter he wears. This is a belt of dark blue\r\nvelvet edged with gold and ornamented with a heavy gold buckle and ornament\r\nat the end. It carries the motto of the Order, \"Honi soit qui mal y pense,\"\r\nin gold letters of plain Roman character. Anciently the motto was spelled\r\n\"Hony soit qy mal y pense,\" as may be noticed from some of the early Garter\r\nplates, and the style {563} of the letter was what is now known as \"Old\r\nEnglish.\" The garter is worn buckled, with the end tucked under and looped\r\nin a specified manner, which is the method also adopted in heraldic\r\nrepresentations. It is quite permissible to use the garter alone, but a\r\nKnight of the Order is allowed to add outside the garter the representation\r\nof the collar of the order. This is of gold, consisting of twenty-six\r\nbuckled garters enamelled in the correct colour, each surrounding a rose,\r\nthe garter alternated with gold knots all joined up by chain links of gold.\r\nFrom the collar depends the \"George,\" or figure of St. George on horseback\r\nencountering the dragon, enamelled in colours. In heraldic representations\r\nit is usual to ignore the specified number of links in the collar. A Knight\r\nof the Garter as such is entitled to claim the privilege of a grant of\r\nsupporters, but as nowadays the order is reserved for those of the rank of\r\nearl and upwards, supporters will always have a prior existence in\r\nconnection with the peerage.\r\n\r\n_Knights of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle_ are\r\nentitled to surround their arms with a plain circle of green edged with\r\ngold and bearing the motto in gold letters, \"Nemo me impune lacessit.\" They\r\nare also entitled to surround their arms with the collar of the order,\r\nwhich is of gold, and composed of sprigs of thistle and rue (Andrew)\r\nenamelled in their proper colours. From the collar the badge (the figure of\r\nSt. Andrew) depends.\r\n\r\n_Knights of the Most Illustrious Order of St. Patrick_ are entitled to\r\nsurround their arms by a plain circle of sky-blue edged with gold, bearing\r\nthe motto, \"Quis Separabit. MDCCLXXXIII,\" as enamelled on the star of the\r\norder. This is encircled by the collar of the order, which is of \"gold,\r\ncomposed of roses and harps alternately, tied together with knots of gold,\r\nthe said roses enamelled alternately, white leaves within red and red\r\nleaves within white; and in the centre of the said collar shall be an\r\nImperial crown surmounting a harp of gold, from which shall hang the\r\nbadge.\"\r\n\r\nKnights of the Thistle and St. Patrick are entitled as such to claim a\r\ngrant of supporters on payment of the fees, but these orders are nowadays\r\nconfined to peers.\r\n\r\n_The Most Honourable Order of the Bath._--Knights of the Bath, who have\r\nexisted from a remote period, do not appear as such to have made any\r\nadditions to their arms prior to the revival of the order in 1725. At that\r\ntime, similarly to the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle, the order was\r\nof one class only and composed of a limited number of knights. Knights of\r\nthat order were then distinguished by the letters K.B., which, it should be\r\nnoted, mean Knight of the Bath, and not Knight Bachelor, as so many people\r\nnow imagine. There is nobody at the present time who is entitled to use\r\nthese letters. Upon those {564} of the Bath plates which now remain in the\r\nchapel of Henry VII. in Westminster Abbey, no instance will be found in\r\nwhich the collar is represented outside the circle, which is pretty good\r\nevidence that although isolated examples may possibly be found at an\r\nearlier date, it was not the usual custom up to the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury to encircle a shield with a collar of knighthood. These Knights of\r\nthe Bath (K.B.), as they were termed, surrounded their escutcheons with\r\ncirclets of crimson edged with gold, and bearing thereupon the motto of the\r\norder, \"Tria juncta in uno,\" in gold letters.\r\n\r\nAlthough at that time it does not appear that the collar of the order was\r\never employed for armorial purposes, instances are to be found in which the\r\nlaurel wreath surrounded the circlet with the motto of the order.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1815, owing to the large number of officers who had merited\r\nreward in the Peninsular Campaign, it was considered necessary to largely\r\nincrease the extent and scope of the order. For this purpose it was divided\r\ninto two divisions--the Military Division and the Civil Division--and each\r\nof these were divided into three classes, namely, Knights Grand Cross\r\n(G.C.B.), Knights Commanders (K.C.B.), and Companions (C.B.). The then\r\nexisting Knights of the Bath became Knights Grand Cross. The existing\r\ncollar served for all Knights Grand Cross, but the old badge and star were\r\nassigned for the civil division of the order, a new pattern being designed\r\nfor the military division. The number of stalls in Henry VII.'s Chapel\r\nbeing limited, the erection of Stall plates and the display of banners\r\nceased; those then in position were allowed to remain, and still remain at\r\nthe present moment. Consequently there are no Stall plates to refer to in\r\nthe matter as precedents since that period, and the rules need to be\r\nobtained from other sources. They are now as follows: A Knight Grand Cross\r\nof the Order of the Bath surrounds his arms with the circlet as was\r\ntheretofore the case, and in addition he surrounds the circlet by his\r\ncollar, from which depends the badge (either military or civil) of the\r\ndivision to which he belongs. The collar is really for practical purposes\r\nthe distinguishing mark of a Knight Grand Cross, because although as such\r\nhe is entitled upon payment of the fees to claim a grant of supporters, he\r\nis under no compulsion to do so, and comparatively but few avail themselves\r\nof the privilege. All Knights of the Bath, before the enlargement of the\r\norder, had supporters. A Knight Grand Cross of the _military_ division\r\nencircles his arms with the laurel wreath in addition, this being placed\r\noutside the circlet and within the collar of the order. The collar is\r\ncomposed of gold having nine Imperial crowns and eight devices of the rose,\r\nthe thistle, and shamrock issuing from a sceptre placed alternately and\r\nenamelled in {565} their proper colours, the links being connected with\r\nseventeen knots enamelled white. The badges of the military and civil\r\ndivisions differ considerably.\r\n\r\nKnights Commanders of the Bath have no collar and cannot claim a grant of\r\nsupporters, but they encircle their shields with the circlet of the order,\r\nsuspending their badge below the shield by the ribbon from which it is\r\nworn. Knights Commanders of the military division use the laurel wreath as\r\ndo Knights Grand Cross, but no members of any class of the civil division\r\nare entitled to display it.\r\n\r\nCompanions of the order (C.B.) do not use the helmet of a knight as does a\r\nG.C.B. or a K.C.B.; in fact, the only difference which is permissible in\r\ntheir arms from those of an undistinguished commoner is that they are\r\nallowed to suspend the badge of a C.B. from a ribbon below their shields.\r\nThey do not use the circlet of the order. Certain cases have come under my\r\nnotice in which a military C.B. has added a laurel wreath to his armorial\r\nbearings, but whether such a practice is correct I am unaware, but I think\r\nit is not officially recognised.\r\n\r\n_The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India_ (like the Order of the Bath\r\nas at present constituted) is divided into three classes, Knights Grand\r\nCommanders, Knights Commanders, and Companions. Knights Grand Commanders\r\nplace the circlet of the order around their shields. This is of light blue\r\ninscribed with the motto, \"Heaven's light our guide.\" This in its turn is\r\nsurrounded by the collar of the order, which is composed of alternate links\r\nof the Indian lotus flower, crossed palm-branches, and the united red and\r\nwhite rose of England. In the centre of the collar is an Imperial crown\r\nfrom which depends the badge of the order, this being an onyx cameo of the\r\neffigy of her late Majesty Queen Victoria within the motto of the order,\r\nand surmounted by a star, the whole being richly jewelled. The surrounding\r\nof the shield by the circlet of the order doubtless is a consequence and\r\nfollows upon the original custom of the armorial use of the garter, but\r\nthis being admitted, it is yet permissible to state that that practice came\r\nfrom the Continent, and there is little reason to doubt that the real\r\nmeaning and origin of the custom of using the circlet is derived from the\r\nContinental practice which has for long been usual of displaying the shield\r\nof arms upon the star of an order of knighthood. The star of every British\r\norder--the Garter included--contains the circlet and motto of the order,\r\nand it is easy to see how, after depicting the shield of arms upon the star\r\nof the order, the result will be that the circlet of the order surrounds\r\nthe shield. No armorial warrant upon the point is ever issued at the\r\ncreation of an order; the thing follows as a matter of course, the circlet\r\nbeing taken from the star to surround the shield without further\r\nauthorisation. Upon this point {566} there can be no doubt, inasmuch as the\r\ngarter which surrounds the shield of a K.G. is in _all_ authoritative\r\nheraldic paintings buckled in the peculiar manner in which it is worn and\r\nin which it is depicted upon the star. The Star of the Thistle shows the\r\nplain circlet, the Star of St. Patrick the same, and the arms of a Knight\r\nof St. Patrick afford a curious confirmation of my contention, because\r\nwhilst the motto of the order is specified to be, \"Quis separabit,\" the\r\ncirclet used for armorial purposes includes the date (MDCCLXXXIII.) as\r\nshown upon the star. The Order of the Bath, again, has a plain circlet upon\r\nthe star, and the badges and stars of the military knights have the laurel\r\nwreath represented in heraldic drawings, the laurel wreath being absent\r\nfrom the stars and the shields of those who are members of the civil\r\ndivision. Now with regard to the Order of the Star of India the motto on\r\nthe star is carried upon a representation of a ribbon which is tied in a\r\ncurious manner, and my own opinion is that the circlet used to surround the\r\nshield of a G.C.S.I. or K.C.S.I. should (as in the case of the garter) be\r\nrepresented not as a simple circlet like the Bath or Thistle, but as a\r\nribbon tied in the curious manner represented upon the star. This tying is\r\nnot, however, duplicated upon the badge, and possibly I may be told that\r\nthe circlet and its use are taken from the badge and not from the star. The\r\nreply to such a statement is, first, that there is no garter upon the badge\r\nof that order, there is no circlet on the badge of the Thistle, and the\r\ncirclet on the badge of St. Patrick is surrounded by a wreath of trefoils\r\nwhich in that case ought to appear round the shield of a K.P. This wreath\r\nof trefoils is absent from the K.P. star. Further, no Companion of an Order\r\nis permitted to use the Circlet of the Order, whilst every Companion has\r\nhis badge. No Companion has a star. Though I hold strongly that the circlet\r\nof the Star of India should be a ribbon tied as represented on the star of\r\nthe order, I must admit I have never yet come across an official instance\r\nof it being so represented. This, however, is a point upon which there is\r\nno definite warrant of instruction, and is not the conclusion justifiable\r\nthat on this matter the officers of arms have been led into a mistake in\r\ntheir general practice by an oversight and possible unfamiliarity with the\r\nactual star? A Knight Grand Commander is entitled to claim a grant of\r\nsupporters on payment of the fees. A Knight Commander encircles his shield\r\nwith the circlet of the order and hangs his badge from a ribbon below, a\r\nCompanion of the Order simply hangs the badge he wears below his shield.\r\n\r\nTHE MOST DISTINGUISHED ORDER OF ST. MICHAEL AND ST. GEORGE.--This order\r\nagain is divided into three classes--Knights Grand Cross, Knights\r\nCommanders, and Companions. Knights Grand Cross place the circlet of the\r\norder and the collar with the badge around their shields, {567} and, like\r\nother Knights Grand Cross, they are entitled to claim a grant of\r\nsupporters. The circlet of the order is of blue edged with gold, and\r\nbearing in gold letters the motto of the order, \"Auspicium melioris ævi.\"\r\nThe collar is composed alternately of lions of England, of Maltese crosses,\r\nand of the ciphers S.M. and S.G., and having in the centre an Imperial\r\ncrown over two lions passant guardant, each holding a bunch of seven\r\narrows. At the opposite point of the collar are two similar lions. The\r\nwhole is of gold except the crosses, which are of white enamel, and the\r\nvarious devices are linked together by small gold chains. Knights\r\nCommanders of the Order encircle their shields with a similar circlet of\r\nthe order, and hang their badges below. A Companion simply suspends his\r\nbadge from a ribbon below his shield.\r\n\r\n_The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire._--This order is divided into\r\nthree classes--Knights Grand Commanders, Knights Commanders, and\r\nCompanions. Knights Grand Commanders and Knights Commanders encircle their\r\nshields with the circlet of the order, which is of purple inscribed in\r\nletters of gold, with the motto of the order, \"Imperatricis auspiciis.\" The\r\ncollar of the order, which is used by the Knights Grand Commanders, in\r\naddition to the circle, is composed of elephants, lotus flowers, peacocks\r\nin their pride, and Indian roses, and in the centre is an Imperial crown,\r\nthe whole being linked together by chains of gold. Knights Commanders\r\nsuspend their badges from their shields. Companions are only permitted to\r\nsuspend their badges from a ribbon, and, as in the cases of the other\r\norders, are not allowed to make use of the circlet of the order.\r\n\r\n_The Royal Victorian Order_ is divided into five classes, and is the only\r\nBritish order of which this can be said. There is no collar belonging to\r\nthe order, so a G.C.V.O. cannot put one round his shield. Knights Grand\r\nCross surround their shields with the circlet of the order, which is of\r\ndark blue carrying in letters of gold the motto, \"Victoria.\" Knights\r\nCommanders and Commanders also use the circlet, with the badge suspended\r\nfrom the ribbon. Members of the fourth and fifth classes of the Order\r\nsuspend the badge which they are entitled to wear below their shields. The\r\n\"Victorian Chain\" is quite apart from the Victorian Order, and up to the\r\npresent time has only been conferred upon a very limited number. It\r\napparently exists by the pleasure of His Majesty, no statutes having been\r\nordained.\r\n\r\nThe Distinguished Service Order, the Imperial Service Order, and the Order\r\nof Merit are each of but one class only, none of them conferring the\r\ndignity of knighthood. They rank heraldically with the Companions of the\r\nother Orders, and for heraldic purposes merely confer upon those people\r\nentitled to the decorations the right to {568} suspend the badges they wear\r\nbelow their shields or lozenges as the case may be, following the rules\r\nobserved by other Companions. The Victoria Cross, the Albert Medal, the\r\nEdward Medal, the Conspicuous Service Cross, the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal, the\r\nRoyal Red Cross, the Volunteer Officers' Decoration, the Territorial\r\nDecoration, and the Decoration of the League of Mercy all rank as\r\ndecorations. Though none confer any style or precedence of knighthood,\r\nthose entitled to them are permitted to suspend representations of such\r\ndecorations as are enjoyed below their shields.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Orders of Victoria and Albert and of the Crown of India\r\nare permitted to display the badges they wear below their lozenges.\r\n\r\nSome people, notably in the early part of the nineteenth century, adopted\r\nthe practice of placing war medals below the escutcheons amongst other\r\ndecorations. It is doubtful, however, how far this practice is correct,\r\ninasmuch as a medal does not technically rank as a decoration or as a\r\nmatter of honour. That medals are \"decorations\" is not officially\r\nrecognised, with the exception, perhaps, of the Jubilee medal, the Diamond\r\nJubilee medal, and the Coronation medal, which have been given a status\r\nmore of the character of a decoration than of simple medals.\r\n\r\n_The Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem in England_ does not\r\nrank with other orders or decorations, inasmuch as it was initiated without\r\nRoyal intervention, and carries no precedence or titular rank. In 1888,\r\nhowever, a Royal charter of incorporation was obtained, and the\r\ndistribution of the highest offices of the order in the persons of the\r\nSovereign, the Prince of Wales, and other members of the Royal Family has\r\nof late years very much increased its social status. The Order is, however,\r\nnow recognised to a certain extent, and its insignia is worn at Court by\r\nduly appointed authority. The Crown is gradually acquiring a right of veto,\r\nwhich will probably eventually result in the order becoming a recognised\r\nhonour, of which the gift lies with the Crown. In the charter of\r\nincorporation, Knights of Justice and Ladies of Justice were permitted to\r\nplace as a chief over their arms the augmentation anciently used by knights\r\nof the English language of the original Roman Catholic Celibate Order. The\r\nchief used is: \"Gules, charged with a cross throughout argent, the cross\r\nembellished in its angles with lions passant guardant and unicorns passant\r\nalternately both or,\" as in the cross of the order. The omission, which is\r\nall the more inexplicable owing to the fact that Garter King of Arms is the\r\nofficer for the order, that the heraldic provisions of this charter have\r\nnever been conveyed, as should have been the case, in a Royal Warrant to\r\nthe Earl Marshal, has caused some {569} confusion, for the officers of the\r\nCollege of Arms, when speaking officially, decline to admit the insignia of\r\nthe order in any official emblazonment of arms. Lyon King of Arms has been\r\nless punctilious.\r\n\r\nKnights of Justice, Knights of Grace, and Esquires of the Orders all\r\nsuspend the badges they wear from a black watered-silk ribbon below their\r\nshields (Fig. 334), and Ladies of Justice and Ladies of Grace do the same\r\nbelow their lozenges. The arms of members of the Order are frequently\r\ndepicted superimposed upon the Cross. By the Statutes of the Order Knights\r\nof Justice were required to show that all their four grandparents were\r\nlegally entitled to bear arms, but so many provisions for the exercise of\r\ndiscretion in dispensing with this requirement were at the same time\r\ncreated that to all intents and purposes such a regulation might never have\r\nbeen included. Some of the Knights of Justice even yet have no arms at all,\r\nothers are themselves grantees, and still others would be unable to show\r\nwhat is required of them if the claims of their grandparents were properly\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nIt should perhaps be stated that supporters, when granted to Knights Grand\r\nCross as such, are personal to themselves, and in the patents by which they\r\nare granted the grant is made for life only, no hereditary limitation being\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nAny person in this country holding a Royal Licence to wear the insignia of\r\nany foreign order is permitted to adopt any heraldic form, decoration, or\r\ndisplay which that order confers in the country of origin. Official\r\nrecognition exists for this, and many precedents can be quoted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 772.--\"Bailli-profès\" of the Catholic Order of the\r\nKnights Hospitallers or the Order of Malta.]\r\n\r\nThe rules which exist in foreign countries concerning heraldic privileges\r\nof the knights of different orders are very varied, and it is impossible to\r\nbriefly summarise them. It may, however, be stated that the most usual\r\npractice is to display the shield alone in the centre of the star (Fig.\r\n772). As with us, the collars of the orders are placed around the shields,\r\nand the badges depend below, but the use of the circlet carrying the motto\r\nof the order is exclusively a British practice. In the case of some of the\r\nOrders, however, the official coat of arms of the order is quartered,\r\nimpaled, or borne in pretence with the personal arms, and the cross patée\r\nof the Order of the Dannebrog is to be met with placed in front of a shield\r\nof quarterings, the charges thereupon appearing in the angles of the cross.\r\nI am not sure, however, that the cases which have come under my notice\r\nshould not be rather considered {570} definite and hereditary grants of\r\naugmentation, this being perhaps a more probable explanation than that such\r\na method of display followed as a matter of course on promotion to the\r\norder. The Grand Masters of the Teutonic Order quarter the arms of that\r\norder with those of their families. The Knights of the Order of St. Stephen\r\nof Tuscany bear the arms of that order in chief over their personal arms.\r\nFig. 772 represents the manner in which a \"Bailli-profès\" (Grand Cross) of\r\nthe real Catholic and Celibate Order of St. John of Malta places the chief\r\nof the order on his shield, the latter being imposed upon a Maltese star\r\n(this being white) and the badge of the order depending below. The\r\n\"Knight-profès\" does not use the chief of the order. In the German\r\nProtestant Order of Malta (formerly Bailiwick of Brandenburg) the\r\nCommendatores place the shield of their arms upon the Cross of Malta. The\r\nKnights of Justice (\"Richtsritter\") on the contrary assume the cross upon\r\nthe shield itself, whilst the Knights of Grace suspend it from the bottom\r\nof the shield. The members of the ancient Order of La Cordelière formerly\r\nencircled their lozenges with a representation of the Cordelière, which\r\nformed a part of their habit; and the officers of the Ecclesiastical Orders\r\nfrequently surround their escutcheons with rosaries from which depend\r\ncrucifixes. Whether this latter practice, however, should be considered\r\nmerely a piece of artistic decoration, or whether it should be regarded as\r\nan ecclesiastical matter or should be included within the purview of\r\narmory, I leave others to decide.\r\n\r\nBy a curious fiction, for the origin of which it is not easy to definitely\r\naccount, unless it is a survival of the celibacy required in certain\r\norders, a knight is not supposed to share the insignia of any order of\r\nknighthood with his wife. There is not the slightest doubt that his own\r\nknighthood does confer upon her both precedence and titular rank, and why\r\nthere should be any necessity for the statement to be made as to the\r\ntheoretical position has long been a puzzle to me. Such a theory, however,\r\nis considered to be correct, and as a consequence in modern times it has\r\nbecome a rigid rule that the arms of the wife of a knight must not be\r\nimpaled upon a shield when it is displayed within the circlet of an order.\r\nNo such rule existed in ancient times, and many instances can be found in\r\nwhich impaled shields, or the shield of the wife only, are met with inside\r\na representation of the Garter. In the warrant recently issued for Queen\r\nAlexandra the arms of England and Denmark are impaled within a Garter. This\r\nmay be quite exceptional and consequent upon the fact that Her Majesty is\r\nherself a member of the Order. Nevertheless, the modern idea is that when a\r\nKnight of any Order impales the arms of his wife, he must use two shields\r\nplaced accollé, the dexter {571} surmounting the sinister (Fig. 745). Upon\r\nthe dexter shield is represented the arms of the knight within the circlet,\r\nor the circlet and collar, as the case may be, of his order; on the\r\nsinister shield the arms of the knight are impaled with those of his wife,\r\nand this shield, for the purpose of artistic balance, is usually surrounded\r\nwith a meaningless and inartistic floral or laurel wreath to make its size\r\nsimilar to the dimensions of the dexter shield.\r\n\r\nThe widow of a knight of any Order is required at present to immediately\r\ndiscontinue the use of the ensigns of that Order, and to revert to the\r\nplain impaled lozenge which she would be entitled to as the widow of an\r\nundecorated gentleman. As she retains her titular rank, such a regulation\r\nseems absurd, but it undoubtedly exists, and until it is altered must be\r\nconformed to.\r\n\r\nKnights Grand Cross and Knights Commanders, as also Knights Bachelors, use\r\nthe open affronté helmet of a knight. Companions of any order, and members\r\nof those orders which do not confer any precedence or title of knighthood,\r\nuse only the close profile helmet of a gentleman. A Knight Bachelor, of\r\ncourse, is at liberty to impale the arms of his wife upon his escutcheon\r\nwithout employing the double form. It only makes the use of the double\r\nescutcheon for Knights of Orders the more incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nReference should also be made to the subject of impalement, which will be\r\nfound in the chapter upon Marshalling. {572}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE ARMORIAL BEARINGS OF A LADY\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that armory was so deeply interwoven with all that was best\r\nin chivalry, it is curious that the armorial status of a woman should have\r\nbeen left so undefined. A query as to how a lady may bear arms will be\r\nglibly answered for her as maid (Fig. 749) and as widow (Figs. 750, 751,\r\nand 752) by the most elementary heraldic text-book. But a little\r\nconsideration will show how far short our knowledge falls of a complete or\r\nuniform set of rules.\r\n\r\nLet what is definitely known be first stated. In the first place, no woman\r\n(save a Sovereign) can inherit, use, or transmit crest or motto, nor may\r\nshe use a helmet or mantling. All daughters, if unmarried, bear _upon a\r\nlozenge_ the paternal arms and quarterings of their father, with his\r\ndifference marks. If their mother were an heiress, they quarter her arms\r\nwith those of her father. In England (save in the Royal Family, and in this\r\ncase even it is a matter of presumption only) there is no seniority amongst\r\ndaughters, and the difference marks of all daughters are those borne by the\r\nfather, and none other. There are no marks of distinction as between the\r\ndaughters themselves. In Scotland, however, seniority does exist, according\r\nto priority of birth; and, though Scottish heraldic law provides no marks\r\nof cadency as between sister and sister, the laws of arms north of the\r\nTweed recognise seniority of birth in the event of a certain set of\r\ncircumstances arising.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, as doubtless many are aware, certain untitled Scottish\r\nfamilies, for reasons which may or may not be known, have been permitted to\r\nuse supporters to their arms. When the line vests in coheirs, the eldest\r\nborn daughter, as heir of line, assumes the supporters, unless some other\r\nlimitation has been attached to them. Scottish supporters are peculiar\r\nthings to deal with, unless the exact terms of the patent of grant or\r\nmatriculation are known.\r\n\r\nThe lozenge of an unmarried lady is frequently surmounted by a true lover's\r\nknot of ribbon, usually painted blue (Fig. 749). It has no particular\r\nmeaning and no official recognition, though plenty of official {573} use,\r\nand practically its status is no more than a piece of supposedly artistic\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nConcerning the law for unmarried ladies, therefore, there is neither doubt\r\nnor dispute. A widow bears arms upon a lozenge, this showing the arms of\r\nher late husband impaled with those of her own family (Fig. 750), or with\r\nthese latter displayed on an escutcheon of pretence if she be an heir or\r\ncoheir (Fig. 751).\r\n\r\nThe other state in the progress of life in which a lady may hope or expect\r\nto find herself is that of married life. Now, how should a married lady\r\ndisplay arms? Echo and the text-books alike answer, \"How?\" Does _anybody_\r\nknow? This \"fault,\" for such it undoubtedly is, is due to the fact that the\r\nlaws of arms evolved themselves in that period when a married woman was\r\nlittle accounted of. As an unmarried heiress she undoubtedly was a\r\nsomebody; as a widowed and richly-jointured dowager she was likewise of\r\naccount, but as a wedded wife her identity was lost, for the Married\r\nWomen's Property Act was not in existence, nor was it thought of. So\r\ncompletely was it recognised that all rights and inheritance of the wife\r\ndevolved of right upon the husband, that formerly the husband enjoyed any\r\npeerage honours which had descended to the wife, and was summoned to\r\nParliament as a peer in his wife's peerage. Small wonder, then, that the\r\nsame ideas dominated the rules of armory. These only provide ways and\r\nmethods for the husband to bear the wife's arms. This is curious, because\r\nthere can be no doubt that at a still earlier period the practice of\r\nimpalement was entirely confined to women, and that, unless the wife\r\nhappened to be an heiress, the husband did not trouble to impale her arms.\r\nBut a little thought will show that the two are not at variance, for if\r\nmonuments and other matters of _record_ are ignored, the earliest examples\r\nof impalement which have come down to us are all, almost without exception,\r\nexamples of arms borne by widows. One cannot get over the fact that a wife\r\nduring coverture had practically no legal status at all. The rules\r\ngoverning impalement, and the conjunction of the arms of man and wife, as\r\nthey are to be borne by the husband, are recited in the chapter upon\r\nMarshalling, which also details the ways in which a widow bears arms in the\r\ndifferent ranks of life. Nothing would be gained by repeating them here.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted, however, that it is not considered correct for a widow to\r\nmake use of the true lover's knot of blue ribbon, which is sometimes used\r\nin the case of an unmarried lady. A divorce puts matters _in statu quo\r\nante_.\r\n\r\nThere still remains, however, the question of the bearing of arms in her\r\nown right by a married woman under coverture at the present day. {574}\r\n\r\nThe earliest grant of arms that I can put my hands upon to a woman is one\r\ndated 1558. It is, moreover, the only grant of which I know to one single\r\nperson, that person being a _wife_. The grant is decidedly interesting, so\r\nI print it in full:--\r\n\r\n    \"TO ALL AND SINGULAR as well kinges heraldes and officers of armes as\r\n    nobles gentlemen and others which these presents shall see or here\r\n    Wyllyam Hervye Esquire otherwise called Clarencieux principall heralde\r\n    and kinge of armes of the south-east and west parties of England\r\n    fendith due comenda[=c]ons and greting fforasmuch as auncientlye ffrom\r\n    the beginnynge the valyant and vertuous actes off excellent parsons\r\n    have ben comended to the worlde with sondry monumentes and remembrances\r\n    off theyr good desertes among the which one of the chefist and most\r\n    usuall hath ben the beringe of figures and tokens in shildes called\r\n    armes beinge none other thinges then Evidences and demonstra[=c]ons of\r\n    prowes and valoure diverselye distributed accordinge to the quallyties\r\n    and desertes of the parsons.

The grant was made in\r\nher husband's lifetime, but his arms are not impaled therewith. Evidently,\r\ntherefore, the lady bears arms _in her own right_, and the presumption\r\nwould seem to be that a married lady bears her arms without reference to\r\nher husband, and bears them upon a shield. On the other hand, the grant to\r\nLady Pearce, referred to on an earlier page, whilst not blazoning the\r\nPearce arms, shows the painting upon the patent to have been a lozenge of\r\nthe arms of Pearce, charged with a baronet's hand impaled with the arms\r\nthen granted for the maiden name of Lady Pearce. On the other hand, a grant\r\nis printed in vol. i. of the Notes to the \"Visitation of England and\r\nWales.\" The grant is to Dame Judith Diggs, widow of Sir Maurice Diggs,\r\nBart., now wife of Daniel Sheldon, and to Dame Margaret Sheldon, her\r\nsister, relict of Sir Joseph Sheldon, Knight, late Alderman, and sometime\r\nLord Mayor of the City of London, daughters and coheirs of Mr. George Rose,\r\nof Eastergate. The operative clause of the grant is: \"do by these Presents\r\ngrant and assign to y^e said Dame Judith and Dame Margaret the Armes\r\nhereafter mentioned Viz^t: Ermine, an Eagle displayed Sable, membered and\r\nbeaked Gules, debruised with a Bendlet Componè Or and Azure, as in the\r\nmargin hereof more plainly appears depicted. To be borne and used for ever\r\nhereafter by them y^e said Dame Judith Diggs and Dame Margaret Sheldon, and\r\nthe descendants of their bodies respectively, lawfully begotten, according\r\nto the Laws, Rules and practice of Armes.\"\r\n\r\nIn each case it will be noted that the sisters were respectively wife and\r\nwidow of some one of the name of Sheldon; and it might possibly be supposed\r\nthat these were arms granted for the name of Sheldon. There seems, however,\r\nto be very little doubt that these are the arms for Rose. The painting is,\r\nhowever, of the single coat of Rose, and one is puzzled to know why the\r\narms are not painted in {576} conjunction with those of Sheldon. The same\r\npractice was followed in the patent which was granted to Nelson's Lady\r\nHamilton. This patent, which both heraldically and historically is\r\nexcessively interesting, was printed in full on p. 168, vol. i. of the\r\n_Genealogical Magazine_. The arms which in the grant are specifically said\r\nto be the arms of Lyons (not of Hamilton) are painted upon a lozenge, with\r\nno reference to the arms of Hamilton. In each of these cases, however, the\r\ngrantee of arms has been an heiress, so that the clause by which the arms\r\nare limited to the descendants does not help. An instance of a grant to a\r\nman and his wife, where the wife was not an heiress, is printed in \"The\r\nRight to Bear Arms\"; and in this case the painting shows the arms impaled\r\nwith those of the husband. The grant to the wife has no hereditary\r\nlimitations, and presumably her descendants would never be able to quarter\r\nthe arms of the wife, no matter even if by the extinction of the other\r\nissue she eventually became a coheir. The fact that the arms of man and\r\nwife are herein granted together prevents any one making any deduction as\r\nto what is the position of the wife alone.\r\n\r\nThere was a patent issued in the year 1784 to a Mrs. Sarah Lax, widow of\r\nJohn Lax, to take the name and arms of Maynard, such name and arms to be\r\nborne by herself and her issue. The painting in this case is of the arms of\r\nMaynard alone upon a lozenge, and the crest which was to be borne by her\r\nmale descendants is quite a separate painting in the body of the grant, and\r\nnot in conjunction with the lozenge. Now, Mrs. Maynard was a widow, and it\r\nis manifestly wrong that she should bear the arms as if she were unmarried,\r\nyet how was she to bear them? She was bearing the name of Lax because that\r\nhad been her husband's name, and she took the name of Maynard, which\r\npresumably her husband would have taken had he been alive; she herself was\r\na Miss Jefferson, so would she have been entitled to have placed the arms\r\nof Jefferson upon an escutcheon of pretence, in the centre of the arms of\r\nMaynard? Presumably she would, because suppose the husband had assumed the\r\nname and arms of Maynard in his lifetime, he certainly would have been\r\nentitled to place his wife's arms of Jefferson on an escutcheon of\r\npretence.\r\n\r\nOn March 9, 1878, Francis Culling Carr, and his second wife, Emily Blanche,\r\ndaughter of Andrew Morton Carr, and niece of the late Field-Marshal Sir\r\nWilliam Maynard Gomm, G.C.B., both assumed by Royal Licence the additional\r\nsurname and arms of Gomm. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Carr-Gomm appear to have had\r\nany blood descent from the Gomm family; consequently the Gomm arms were\r\ngranted to both husband and wife, and the curious part is that they were\r\nnot identical, the marks (showing that there was no blood relationship)\r\nbeing a {577} canton for the husband and a cross crosslet for the wife. In\r\nthis case the arms were impaled. One is puzzled to know why the grant to\r\nthe wife was necessary as well as the grant to the husband.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Mrs. Massy, widow of Hugh Massy, assumed the name and arms of\r\nRichardson in lieu of Massy. Mrs. Massy was the only child of Major\r\nRichardson Brady, who had previously assumed by Royal Licence the arms of\r\nBrady only. The painting upon the patent is a lozenge, bearing the arms of\r\nMassy, and upon an escutcheon of pretence the arms of Richardson. Of\r\ncourse, the arms of Mrs. Massy, as a widow, previously to the issue of the\r\nRoyal Licence were a lozenge of the arms of Massy, and on an escutcheon of\r\npretence the arms of Brady.\r\n\r\nA few years ago a Grant of Arms was issued to a Mrs. Sharpe, widow of Major\r\nSharpe. The arms were _to be borne by herself_ and the descendants of her\r\nlate husband, and by the other descendants of her husband's father, so that\r\nthere is no doubt whatever that these were the arms of Sharpe. I have no\r\nidea who Mrs. Sharpe was, and I do not know that she possessed any arms of\r\nher own. Let us presume she did not. Now, unless a widow may bear the arms\r\nof her late husband on a lozenge, whether she has arms to impale with them\r\nor not, how on earth is she to bear arms at all? And yet the grant most\r\ndistinctly was primarily to Mrs. Sharpe.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of General Ross, the victor of Bladensburg, a grant of an\r\naugmentation was made to be placed upon the monument to the memory of the\r\nGeneral (Plate II.). The grant also was for the augmentation to be borne by\r\nhis widow during her widowhood. But no mention appears of the arms of Mrs.\r\nRoss, nor, as far as I can ascertain, was proof officially made that Mrs.\r\nRoss was in her own right entitled to arms; consequently, whether she\r\nreally was or was not, we may assume that as far as the official\r\nauthorities officially knew she was not, and the same query formulated with\r\nregard to the Sharpe patent holds good in this case. The painting on the\r\npatent shows the arms upon a shield, and placed above is a helmet\r\nsurmounted by the crest of augmentation and the family crest of Ross.\r\n\r\nSo that from the cases we have mentioned instances can be found of the arms\r\nof a wife upon a shield alone, and of a widow having arms depicted upon a\r\nlozenge, such arms being on different occasions the impaled arms of her\r\nhusband and herself, or the arms of herself alone or of her husband alone;\r\nand we have arms granted to a wife, and depicted as an impalement or upon a\r\nlozenge. So that from grants it seems almost impossible to deduce any\r\ndecided and unquestionable rule as to how wife or widow should bear a coat\r\nof arms. There is, {578} however, one other source from which profitable\r\ninstruction may be drawn. I refer to the methods of depicting arms upon\r\nhatchments, and more particularly to the hatchment of a married woman. Now\r\na hatchment is strictly and purely personal, and in the days when the use\r\nof such an article was an everyday matter, the greatest attention was paid\r\nto the proper marshalling of the arms thereupon. There are so many varying\r\ncircumstances that we have here only space to refer to the three simple\r\nrules, and these uncomplicated by any exceptional circumstances, which\r\ngoverned the hatchments of maid, wife, and widow. In the first case, the\r\nhatchment of an unmarried lady showed the whole of the background black,\r\nthe paternal arms on a lozenge, and this suspended by a knot of blue\r\nribbon. In the hatchment of a widow the background again was all black, the\r\narms were upon a lozenge (but without the knot of ribbon), and the lozenge\r\nshowed the arms of husband and wife impaled, or with the wife's in\r\npretence, as circumstances might dictate. The hatchment of a wife was\r\nentirely different. Like the foregoing, it was devoid, of course, of\r\nhelmet, mantling, crest, or motto; but the background was white on the\r\ndexter side (to show that the husband was still alive), and black on the\r\nsinister (to show the wife was dead). But the impaled arms were not\r\ndepicted upon a lozenge, but upon a shield, and the shield was surmounted\r\nby the true lover's knot of blue ribbon.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that when the rules of arms were in the making the\r\npossibility of a married woman bearing arms in her own right was quite\r\nignored, and theoretically even now the husband bears his wife's arms for\r\nher upon his shield. But the arms of a man are never depicted suspended\r\nfrom a true lover's knot. Such a display is distinctly feminine, and I\r\nverily believe that the correct way for a married woman to use arms, if she\r\ndesires the display thereof to be personal to herself rather than to her\r\nhusband, is to place her husband's arms impaled with her own upon a shield\r\nsuspended from a true lover's knot, and without helmet, mantling, crest, or\r\nmotto. At any rate such a method of display is a correct one, it is in no\r\nway open to criticism on the score of inaccuracy, it has precedent in its\r\nfavour, and it affords a very desirable means of distinction. My only\r\nhesitation is that one cannot say it is the only way, or that it would be\r\n\"incorrect\" for the husband. At any rate it is the only way of drawing a\r\ndistinction between the \"married\" achievements of the husband and the wife.\r\n\r\nThe limitations attached to a lady's heraldic display being what they are,\r\nit has long been felt, and keenly felt, by every one attempting heraldic\r\ndesign, that artistic treatment of a lady's arms savoured almost of the\r\nimpossible. What delicacy of treatment can possibly be added to the hard\r\noutline of the lozenge? The substitution of curvilinear for {579} straight\r\nlines in the outline, and even the foliation of the outline, goes but a\r\nlittle way as an equivalent to the extensive artistic opportunities which\r\nthe mantling affords to a designer when depicting the arms of a man.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent, two attempts have been made towards providing a\r\nremedy. Neither can properly claim _official_ recognition, though both have\r\nbeen employed in a quasi-official manner. The one consists of the knot of\r\nribbon; the other consists of the use of the cordelière. In their present\r\nusage the former is meaningless and practically senseless, whilst the use\r\nof the latter is radically wrong, and in my opinion, little short of\r\nimposture. The knot of ribbon, when employed, is usually in the form of a\r\nthin streamer of blue ribbon tied in the conventional true lover's knot\r\n(Fig. 749). But the imbecility and inconsistency of its use lies in the\r\nfact that except upon a hatchment it has been denied by custom to married\r\nwomen and widows, who have gained their lovers; whilst its use is\r\nsanctioned for the unmarried lady, who, unless she be affianced, neither\r\nhas nor ought to have anything whatever to do with lovers or with their\r\nknot. The women who are fancy-free display the tied-up knot; women whom\r\nlove has fast tied up, unless the foregoing opinion as to the correct way\r\nto display the arms of a married lady which I have expressed be correct,\r\nmust leave the knot alone. But as matters stand heraldically at the moment\r\nthe ribbon may be used advantageously with the lozenge of an unmarried\r\nlady.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the cordelière some writers assert that its use is\r\noptional, others that its use is confined to widow ladies. Now as a matter\r\nof fact it is nothing whatever of the kind. It is really the insignia of\r\nthe old French Order of the Cordelière, which was founded by Anne of\r\nBretagne, widow of Charles VIII., in 1498, its membership being confined to\r\nwidow ladies of noble family. The cordelière was the waist girdle which\r\nformed a part of the insignia of the Order, and it took its place around\r\nthe lozenges of the arms of the members in a manner similar to the armorial\r\nuse of the Garter for Knights of that Order. Though the Order of the\r\nCordelière is long since extinct, it is neither right nor proper that any\r\npart of its insignia should be adopted unaltered by those who can show no\r\nconnection with it or membership of it. {580}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL HERALDIC INSIGNIA\r\n\r\nThe armory of all other nations than our own is rich in heraldic emblems of\r\noffice. In France this was particularly the case, and France undoubtedly\r\nfor many centuries gave the example, to be followed by other civilised\r\ncountries, in all matters of honour and etiquette.\r\n\r\nIf English heraldry were entirely destitute of official heraldic ensigns,\r\nperhaps the development elsewhere of this branch of armory might be\r\ndismissed as an entirely foreign growth. But this is far from being the\r\ncase, as there are some number of cases in which these official emblems do\r\nexist. In England, however, the instances are governed by no scale of\r\ncomparative importance, and the appearance of such tokens can only be\r\ndescribed as capricious. That a more extended usage might with advantage be\r\nmade no one can deny, for usage of this character would teach the general\r\npublic that armory had a meaning and a value, it would increase the\r\ninterest in heraldry, and also assist greatly in the rapidly increasing\r\nrevival of heraldic knowledge. The existence of these heraldic emblems\r\nwould manifestly tend towards a revival of the old and interestingly\r\nexcellent custom of regularly setting up in appropriate public places the\r\narms of those who have successively held various offices. The Inns of\r\nCourt, St. George's Chapel, the Public Office at the College of Arms, and\r\nthe halls of some of the Livery Companies are amongst the few places of\r\nimportance where the custom still obtains. And yet what an interesting\r\nmemorial such a series always becomes! The following list may not be\r\nentirely complete, but it is fairly so as far as France is concerned, and I\r\nthink also complete as to England.\r\n\r\nThe following are from the Royal French Court:--\r\n\r\n_The High Constable of France_: Two swords held on each side of the shield\r\nby two hands in armour issuing from the clouds.\r\n\r\n_The Chancellor_: In saltire behind his arms two great maces, and over his\r\nhelmet a mortier or cap sable crossed by two bands of gold lace and turned\r\nup ermine; thereon the figure of a demi-queen as an emblem of France,\r\nholding a sceptre in her right hand and the great seal of the kingdom in\r\nher left. {581}\r\n\r\n_The Marshal_: Two batons in saltire behind the arms azure, semé-de-lis or.\r\n\r\n_The Admiral_: Two anchors in saltire behind the arms, the stocks of the\r\nanchors in chief azure, semé-de-lis or.\r\n\r\n_The General of the Galleys_: Two anchors in saltire behind the arms.\r\n\r\n_Vice-Admiral_: One anchor in pale behind the arms.\r\n\r\n_Colonel-General of the Infantry_: Under his arms in saltire six flags,\r\nthree on each side, white, crimson, and blue.\r\n\r\n_Colonel of the Cavalry_: Over the arms four banners of the arms of France,\r\nfringed, &c., two to the dexter and two to the sinister.\r\n\r\n_Grand Master of the Artillery_: Two field-pieces of ordnance under the\r\narms, one pointing to the dexter and one to the sinister.\r\n\r\n_The Superintendent of the Finance_: Two keys imperially crowned and\r\nendorsed in pale, one on each side of the arms, the dexter or, the sinister\r\nargent.\r\n\r\n_Grand Master of the Household to the King_: Two grand batons of silver\r\ngilt in saltire behind the arms.\r\n\r\n_Grand Almoner_: Under his arms a blue book, on the cover the arms of\r\nFrance and Navarre within the Orders of St. Michael and the Holy Ghost,\r\nover the Orders the Crown.\r\n\r\n_Grand Chamberlain_: Two keys, both imperially crowned or, in saltire\r\nbehind the arms endorsed, the wards-in-chief.\r\n\r\n_Grand Esquire_: On each side of the shield a royal sword erect, the\r\nscabbard azure, semé-de-lis, hilt and pommel or, the belts folded round the\r\nscabbard azure, semé-de-lis or.\r\n\r\n_Grand Pannetier_, who by virtue of his office had all the bakers of Paris\r\nunder his jurisdiction, and had to lay the king's cover at his table, bore\r\nunder his arms a rich cover and a knife and fork in saltire.\r\n\r\n_Grand Butler or Cupbearer_: On each side of the base of the shield, a\r\ngrand silver flagon gilt, with the arms of the King thereon.\r\n\r\n_Gamekeeper to the King_: Two bugle-horns appending from the ends of the\r\nmantling.\r\n\r\n_Grand Falconer_: Two lures appending from the ends of the mantling.\r\n\r\n_Grand Wolf-hunter_: On each side of the shield a wolf's head caboshed.\r\n\r\n_Captain of the King's Guards_: Two small batons sable, headed gold, like a\r\nwalking-cane.\r\n\r\n_Captain of the Hundred Swiss Guards_: Two batons in saltire sable, headed\r\nargent, and under the arms two black velvet caps with feathers.\r\n\r\n_First Master of the Household_: Under his arms two batons in saltire.\r\n\r\n_Grand Carver to His Majesty_: Under his arms a knife and fork in saltire\r\nproper, the handles azure, semé-de-lis or. {582}\r\n\r\n_Grand Provost of the Household_: Under his arms two Roman fasces or,\r\ncorded azure.\r\n\r\n_Grand Quartermaster_: A mace and battle-axe in saltire.\r\n\r\n_Captain of the Guards of the Gate_: Two keys in pale, crowned argent, one\r\non each side the arms.\r\n\r\n_The President of the Parliament_: On his helmet a black cap with two bands\r\nof gold lace.\r\n\r\nUnder the Empire (of France) the Vice-Connétable used arms holding swords,\r\nas had been the case with the Constable of the Kingdom, but the swords were\r\nsheathed and semé of golden bees. The Grand Chamberlain had two golden keys\r\nin saltire, the bows thereof enclosing the imperial eagle, and the batons\r\nof the Maréchaux de French were semé of bees instead of fleurs-de-lis.\r\n\r\nThe Pope bears a cross with three arms, an archbishop one with two arms, a\r\nbishop one with a single arm. Besides this, two crossed keys appertain to\r\nthe Pope, the golden key to bind, in bend dexter, the silver key to loose,\r\nin sinister bend. British archbishops and bishops will be presently\r\nreferred to. Ecclesiastical princes, who were at the same time sovereign\r\nterritorial princes, bore behind their shield a pedum or pastorale\r\n(crosier), crossed with the sword of penal judicature. A bishop bears the\r\ncrosier with an outward bend, an abbot with an inward bend, thus\r\nsymbolising the range of their activity or dominion. The arch and\r\nhereditary offices of the old German Empire had also their own attributes;\r\nthus the \"Erztruchsess,\" Lord High Steward (Palatinate-Bavaria), bore a\r\ngolden Imperial globe, which arose from a misinterpretation of the double\r\ndish, the original attribute of this dignity. The Lord High Marshal of the\r\nEmpire (Saxony) expressed his office by a shield divided \"per fess argent\r\nand sable,\" bearing two crossed swords gules. The Hereditary\r\nStandard-bearer (Würtemberg) bore: \"Azure, a banner or, charged with an\r\neagle sable\"; the Lord High Chamberlain (Brandenburg): \"Azure, a sceptre\r\nor,\" while the Hereditary Chamberlain (Hohenzollern) used: \"Gules, two\r\ncrossed sceptres or.\"\r\n\r\nIn Italy the Duca de Savelli, as Marshal of the Conclave, hangs on either\r\nside of his shield a key, the cords of which are knotted beneath his\r\ncoronet.\r\n\r\nIn Holland Admirals used the naval Crown, and added two anchors in saltire\r\nbehind the shield.\r\n\r\nIn Spain the Admirals of Castile and of the Indies placed an anchor in bend\r\nbehind the shield.\r\n\r\nThe instances I am aware of which have official sanction already in this\r\ncountry are as stated in the list which follows:--\r\n\r\nI have purposely (to make the list absolutely complete) included {583}\r\ninsignia which may possibly be more properly considered ensigns of rank,\r\nbecause it is not particularly easy always to distinguish offices from\r\nhonours and from rank.\r\n\r\n_The Kings of England_ (George I. to William IV.), as Arch Treasurers of\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire, bore: Upon an inescutcheon gules, in the centre of\r\nthe arms of Hanover, a representation of the Crown of Charlemagne.\r\n\r\n_An Archbishop_ has: (1) His official coat of arms, which he impales\r\n(placing it on the dexter side) with his personal arms; (2) his mitre,\r\nwhich, it should be noted, is the same as the mitre of a Bishop, and _not_\r\nhaving a coronet encircling its band; (3) his archiepiscopal staff (of\r\ngold, and with two transverse arms), which is placed in pale behind his\r\nescutcheon; (4) two crosiers in saltire behind the escutcheon. It is\r\ncurious to note that the pallium which occurs in all archiepiscopal coats\r\nof arms (save that of York) is now very generally conceded to have been\r\nmore in the nature of an emblem of the _rank_ of Archbishop (it being a\r\npart of his ecclesiastical costume) than a charge in a concrete impersonal\r\ncoat of arms for a defined area of archiepiscopal jurisdiction. In this\r\nconnection it is interesting to observe that the Archbishops of York\r\nanciently used the pallium in lieu of the official arms now regularly\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n_A Bishop_ has: (1) His official coat of arms, (2) his mitre, (3) two\r\ncrosiers in saltire behind his escutcheon.\r\n\r\n_The Bishop of Durham_ has: (1) His official coat of arms, (2) his\r\ncoronetted mitre, _which is peculiar to himself_, and (which is another\r\nprivilege also peculiar to himself alone) he places a _sword_ and a crosier\r\nin saltire behind his arms. Reference should also be made to the chapter\r\nupon Ecclesiastical Heraldry.\r\n\r\n_A Peer_ has: (1) His coronet, (2) his helmet of rank; (3) his supporters,\r\n(4) his robe of estate.\r\n\r\n_A Scottish Peer_ has, in addition, the ermine lining to his mantling.\r\n\r\n_A Baronet of England_, of Ireland, of Great Britain, or of the United\r\nKingdom has: (1) His helmet of rank, (2) his badge of Ulster upon an\r\ninescutcheon or canton (argent, a sinister hand erect, couped at the wrist\r\ngules).\r\n\r\n_A Baronet of Nova Scotia_ has: (1) His helmet of rank, (2) his badge (an\r\norange tawny ribbon, whereon shall hang pendent in an escutcheon argent, a\r\nsaltire azure, thereon an inescutcheon of the arms of Scotland, with an\r\nimperial crown over the escutcheon, and encircled with this motto, \"Fax\r\nMentis Honestæ Gloria,\" pendent below the escutcheon).\r\n\r\n_A Knight of the Garter_ has: (1) His Garter to encircle the shield, (2)\r\nhis collar and badge, (3) supporters. The Prelate of the Order of {584} the\r\nGarter (an office held by the Bishops of Winchester) is entitled to\r\nencircle his arms with the Garter. The Chancellor of the Order of the\r\nGarter encircles his arms with the Garter. Formerly the Bishops of\r\nSalisbury always held this office, but in 1836 when the county of Berks\r\n(which of course includes Windsor, and therefore the chapel of the order)\r\nwas removed from the Diocese of Salisbury to the Diocese of Oxford, the\r\noffice of Chancellor passed to the Bishops of Oxford. The Dean of Windsor,\r\nas Registrar of the Order, displays below his shield the ribbon and badge\r\nof his office.\r\n\r\n_A Knight of the Thistle_ has: (1) The ribbon or circlet of the order, (2)\r\nhis collar and badge, (3) supporters. The Dean of the Chapels Royal in\r\nScotland, as Dean of the Order, used the badge and ribbon of his office.\r\n\r\n_A Knight of St. Patrick_ has: (1) The ribbon or circlet of the order, (2)\r\nhis collar and badge, (3) supporters. The Prelate of the Order of St.\r\nPatrick was as such entitled to encircle his escutcheon with the ribbon or\r\ncirclet of that order, from which his official badge depends. The office,\r\nof course, came to an end with the disestablishment of the Irish Church. It\r\nwas held by the Archbishops of Armagh. The Chancellor of the Order of St.\r\nPatrick is as such entitled to encircle his escutcheon with the ribbon or\r\ncirclet of that order, from which his official badge depends. This office,\r\nformerly held by the Archbishops of Dublin, has since the disestablishment\r\nbeen enjoyed by the Chief Secretaries for Ireland. The Deans of St.\r\nPatrick's were similarly Registrars of the Order, and as such used the\r\nbadge and ribbon of their office.\r\n\r\n_Knights Grand Cross_ or _Knights Grand Commanders_ of the Orders of the\r\nBath, the Star of India, St. Michael and St. George, the Indian Empire, or\r\nthe Victorian Order, have: (1) The circlets or ribbons of their respective\r\nOrders, (2) their collars and badges, (3) their helmets of degree, (4)\r\nsupporters, if they incline to pay the fees for these to be granted.\r\n\r\n_Knights Commanders_ of the aforesaid Orders have: (1) The circlets or\r\nribbons of their respective Orders, (2) their badges pendent below the\r\nshield, (3) their helmets of degree.\r\n\r\n_Commanders_ of the Victorian Order have: (1) the circlet of the Order, (2)\r\nthe badge pendent below the shield.\r\n\r\n_Companions_ of the aforesaid Orders, and Members of the Victorian Order,\r\nas also Members of the Distinguished Service Order, the Imperial Service\r\nOrder, the Order of Merit, the Order of Victoria and Albert, the Order of\r\nthe Crown of India, and those entitled to the Victoria Cross, the Albert\r\nMedal, the Edward Medal, the Conspicuous Service Cross, the Kaisar-i-Hind\r\nMedal, the Royal Red Cross, the {585} Volunteer Officers' Decoration, the\r\nTerritorial Decoration, and the Decoration of the League of Mercy, are\r\nentitled to suspend their respective decorations below their escutcheons.\r\nThe officers of these orders of knighthood are of course entitled to\r\ndisplay their badges of office. The Dean of Westminster is always Dean of\r\nthe Order of the Bath.\r\n\r\n_Knights Grand Cross_ and_ Knights Commanders of the Bath, if of the\r\nMilitary Division_, are also entitled to place a wreath of laurel round\r\ntheir escutcheons.\r\n\r\n_Knights of Justice of the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem\r\nin England_ are entitled to place upon their escutcheons a chief of the\r\narms of the Order (gules, a cross throughout argent, embellished in the\r\nangles with a lion guardant and a unicorn, both passant or).\r\n\r\n_Knights of Grace and other Members of the Order_ suspend whatever badge\r\nthey are entitled to wear below their shield from a black watered-silk\r\nribbon.\r\n\r\n[Some members of the Order display their arms upon the Cross of the Order,\r\nas was done by Knights of the original Order, from which the present Order\r\nis copied, but how far the practice is sanctioned by the Royal Charter, or\r\nin what manner it is controlled by the rules of the Order, I am not aware.]\r\n\r\n_The Lord High Constable of England_ is entitled to place behind his\r\nescutcheon two batons in saltire similar to the one which is delivered to\r\nhim for use at the Coronation, which is now the only occasion when the\r\noffice is enjoyed. As the office is only held temporarily, the existing\r\nprivilege does not amount to much.\r\n\r\n_The Lord High Constable of Scotland_ is entitled to place behind his\r\nescutcheon, in saltire, two silver batons tipped with gold at either end.\r\nThe arms of the Earl of Errol (Hereditary Lord High Constable of Scotland)\r\nhave only once, at an early period, been matriculated in Lyon Register, and\r\nthen without any official insignia, but there can be no doubt of the right\r\nto the crossed batons.\r\n\r\n_The Lord High Chamberlain of Scotland_ (I am not sure this office still\r\nexists): Two golden keys in saltire behind the escutcheon.\r\n\r\n_The Earl Marshal and Hereditary Marshal of England_ places two batons of\r\ngold tipped with sable in saltire behind his arms.\r\n\r\n[_A Deputy Earl Marshal_ places one similar baton in bend behind his\r\nshield.]\r\n\r\n_The Earl Marischal of Scotland_ (until the office was extinguished by\r\nattainder) placed saltirewise behind his shield two batons gules, semé of\r\nthistles, each ensigned on the top with an Imperial Crown or.\r\n\r\n_The Hereditary Marshal of Ireland_ (an office for long past in abeyance)\r\nused two batons in saltire behind his arms. According to {586} MS. Harl.\r\n6589, f. 39: \"Les armes des office du Mareschall d'Ireland sont de Goulz et\r\ncinque fucelles bendes d'Argent.\" These certainly do not appear to be the\r\npersonal arms of those who held the office, but there is other record that\r\nsome such coat was used.\r\n\r\n_The Hereditary Lord Great Seneschal of Ireland_ (the Earl of Shrewsbury)\r\nplaces a white wand in pale behind his escutcheon.\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Argyll_ places in saltire behind his arms: (1) In bend dexter,\r\na baton gules, semé of thistles or, ensigned with an Imperial Crown proper,\r\nthereon the crest of Scotland (as Hereditary Great Master of the Household\r\nin Scotland); (2) in bend sinister, a sword proper, hilt and pommel or (as\r\nHereditary Justice-General of Scotland) (_vide_ Plate III.).\r\n\r\n_The Master-General of the Ordnance_ (by warrant of King Charles II.),\r\nbears on each side of his arms a field-piece.\r\n\r\n_The Lord Justice-Clerk of Scotland_ places two swords in saltire behind\r\nhis shield.\r\n\r\n_The Lord Chief-Justice of England_ encircles his arms with his Collar of\r\nSS.\r\n\r\n_The Walker Trustees_ place behind their shield two batons in saltire, each\r\nensigned with a unicorn salient supporting a shield argent, the unicorn\r\nhorned or, and gorged with an antique crown, to which is affixed a chain\r\npassing between the fore-legs and reflexed over the back of the last, for\r\nthe office of Heritable Usher of the White Rod of Scotland, now vested in\r\nthe said Trustees. Before the recent Court of Claims the claim was made to\r\nexercise the office by deputy, and such claim was allowed.\r\n\r\n_The Master of the Revels in Scotland_ has an official coat of arms:\r\nArgent, a lady rising out of a cloud in the nombril point, richly\r\napparelled, on her head a garland of ivy, holding in her right hand a\r\npoignard crowned, in her left a vizard all proper, standing under a veil or\r\ncanopy azure garnished or, in base a thistle vert.\r\n\r\n_Serjeants-at-Arms_ encircle their arms with their Collars of SS.\r\n\r\n_Garter King of Arms_ has: (1) His official coat of arms (argent, a gules,\r\non a chief azure, a ducal coronet encircled with a Garter, between a lion\r\npassant guardant on the dexter, and a fleur-de-lis on the sinister, all\r\nor); (2) his crown; (3) his Collar of SS (the collar of a King of Arms\r\ndiffers from that of a Herald, inasmuch as it is of _silver-gilt_, and on\r\neach shoulder a portcullis is inserted); (4) his badge as Garter pendent\r\nbelow his shield. His sceptre of silver-gilt has been sometimes placed in\r\nbend behind his escutcheon, but this has not been regularly done. The\r\npractice has, however, been reverted to by the present Garter.\r\n\r\n_Lyon King of Arms_ has: (1) His official coat of arms (argent, a lion\r\nsejant, erect and affronté gules, holding in his dexter paw a thistle {587}\r\nslipped vert, and in the sinister a shield of the second, on a chief azure\r\na St. Andrew's cross--_i.e._ a saltire--of the field); (2) his crown; (3)\r\ntwo batons, representing that of his office in saltire behind his shield,\r\nthese being azure semé of thistles and fleurs-de-lis or, tipped at either\r\nend with gold; (4) his Collar of SS; (5) his triple chain of gold, from\r\nwhich depends his badge as Lyon King of Arms.\r\n\r\n_Ulster King of Arms_ has: (1) His official coat of arms (or, a cross\r\ngules, on a chief of the last a lion of England between a harp and a\r\nportcullis, all of the first); (2) his crown; (3) his Collar of SS; (4) his\r\ntwo staves in saltire behind the shield; (5) his chain and badge as Ulster\r\nKing of Arms; (6) his badge as Registrar of the Order of St. Patrick.\r\n\r\n_Clarenceux King of Arms_ has: (1) His official coat of arms (argent, a\r\ncross gules, on a chief of the second a lion passant guardant or, crowned\r\nof the last); (2) his crown; (3) his Collar of SS.\r\n\r\n_Norroy King of Arms_ has: (1) His official coat of arms (argent, a cross\r\ngules, on a chief of the second a lion of England passant guardant or,\r\ncrowned with an open crown, between a fleur-de-lis on the dexter and a key\r\non the sinister of the last); (2) his crown; (3) his Collar of SS.\r\n\r\n_Bath King of Arms_ has: (1) His crown; his Collar of SS.\r\n\r\nI am not aware that any official arms have been assigned to Bath up to the\r\npresent time; but if none exist, there would not be the slightest\r\ndifficulty in obtaining these.\r\n\r\n_An English Herald_ encircles his shield with his Collar of SS.\r\n\r\n_A Scottish Herald_ is entitled to do the same, and has also his badge,\r\nwhich he places below the escutcheon pendent from a ribbon of blue and\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nAn _Irish Herald_ has his Collar of SS, and his badge suspended from a\r\nsky-blue ribbon. An _Irish Pursuivant_ has a similar badge.\r\n\r\n_The Regius Professors (or \"Readers\") in the University of Cambridge_, for\r\n\"Phisicke,\" \"Lawe,\" \"Devinity,\" \"Hebrew,\" and \"Greke,\" have official arms\r\nas follows (see grant by Robert Cooke, Clarenceux, 1590, _Genealogical\r\nMagazine_, vol. ii. p. 125):--\r\n\r\n_Of Phisicke_: Azure, a fesse ermines (? ermine) between three lozenges or,\r\non a chief gules a lion passant guardant of the third, charged on the side\r\nwith the letter M sable. Crest: on a wreath or and azure, a quinquangle\r\nsilver, called \"simbolum sanitatis.\" Mantling gules and argent.\r\n\r\n_Of Lawe_: Purpure, a cross moline or, on a chief gules, a lion passant\r\nguardant of the second, charged on the side with the letter L sable. Crest:\r\non a wreath \"purple and gold,\" a bee volant or. Mantling gules and argent.\r\n\r\n_Of Devinity_: Gules, on a cross ermine, between four doves argent, {588} a\r\nbook of the first, the leaves or, charged in the midst with the Greek\r\nletter [theta] (Theta) sable. Crest: on a wreath \"silver and gules,\" a dove\r\nvolant argent, with an olive-branch vert in his beak. Mantling gules,\r\ndouble argent.\r\n\r\n_Of Hebrew_: Argent, the Hebrew letter [Hebrew: T] (Tawe) sable, on a chief\r\ngules, a lion passant guardant or, charged on the side with the letter H\r\nsable. Crest: on a wreath \"silver and sables,\" a turtle-dove azure.\r\nMantling gules, double argent.\r\n\r\n_Of Greke_: Per chevron argent and sable, in chief the two Greek letters\r\n[Alpha] (Alpha) and [Omega] (Omega) of the second, and in base a \"cicado\"\r\nor grasshopper of the first, on a chief gules, a lion passant guardant or,\r\ncharged on the side with the letter G sable. Crest: on a wreath \"silver and\r\nsables,\" an owl argent, legs, beak, and ears or. Mantling gules and argent.\r\n\r\nThe following insignia of office I quote subject to the reservation that I\r\nam doubtful how far they enjoy official sanction:--\r\n\r\n_The Lord Chancellor of England_: Two maces in saltire (or one in pale)\r\nbehind the shield and the purse containing the Great Seal below it.\r\n\r\n_The Lord Great Chamberlain of England_: Two golden keys in saltire; and\r\n\r\n_The Lord Chamberlain of the Household_: A golden key in pale behind the\r\nshield.\r\n\r\nAt Exeter the Dean, Precentor, Chancellor, and Treasurer have used official\r\narms impaled with their own insignia. These were:--\r\n\r\n_The Dean_: Azure, a stag's head caboshed and between the horns a cross\r\npatée fitchée argent.\r\n\r\n_The Precentor_: Argent, on a saltire azure a fleur-de-lis or.\r\n\r\n_The Chancellor_: Gules, a saltire argent between four crosslets or.\r\n\r\n_The Treasurer_: Gules, a saltire between four leopards' heads or.\r\n\r\nThe Dean of the Chapel Royal, Savoy, may perhaps employ the complicated\r\ncoat of the chapel to impale his personal arms, placing the escutcheon on\r\nthe breast of an eagle sable, crowned or.\r\n\r\nMany English Deaneries claim to possess arms which presumably the occupant\r\nmay use to impale his own coat with, after the example of the Dean of\r\nExeter. Such are London, Winchester, Lincoln, Salisbury, Lichfield, Durham,\r\nwhich all difference the arms of the see with a letter D of gold or sable.\r\n\r\nSt. David's reverses the tinctures of the arms of the see.\r\n\r\nNorwich and Carlisle carry: Argent, a cross sable.\r\n\r\nCanterbury: Azure, on a cross argent the monogram\r\n\r\nsable.\r\n\r\nYork differences the arms of the see by changing the crown into a mitre,\r\nand adding three plates in flanks and base. {589}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nAUGMENTATIONS OF HONOUR\r\n\r\nOf all heraldic distinctions the possession of an augmentation of honour is\r\nthe one most prized. The Sovereign is of course the fountain of honour, and\r\nthough ordinary grants of arms are made by Letters Patent under the hands\r\nand seals of the Kings of Arms, by virtue of the powers expressly and\r\nspecifically conferred upon them in the Letters Patent respectively\r\nappointing them to their offices, a grant of arms is theoretically a grant\r\nfrom the Crown. The privilege of the possession of arms in the ordinary\r\nevent is left in the discretion of the Earl Marshal, whose warrant is a\r\ncondition precedent to the issue of a Grant. Providing a person is palpably\r\nliving in that style and condition of life in which the use of arms is\r\nusual, subject always to the Earl Marshal's pleasure and discretion, a\r\nGrant of Arms can ordinarily be obtained upon payment of the usual fees.\r\nThe social status of present-day grantees of arms is considerably in\r\nadvance of the status of grantees in the Tudor period. An augmentation of\r\narms, however, is on a totally and entirely different footing. It is an\r\nespecial mark of favour from the Sovereign, and the effective grant is a\r\nRoyal Warrant under the hand and Privy Seal of the Sovereign. The warrant\r\nrecites and requires that the augmentation granted shall be exemplified and\r\nrecorded in the College of Arms. Augmentations have been less frequently\r\nconferred in recent years than was formerly the case. Technically speaking,\r\na gift of arms by the Sovereign direct where none previously existed is not\r\nan augmentation, though one is naturally inclined to include such grants in\r\nthe category. Such an example is met with in the shield granted to Colonel\r\nCarlos by King Charles to commemorate their mutual adventures in the oak\r\ntree (\"Or, issuing from a mount in base vert, an oak tree proper, over all\r\non a fess gules, three Imperial crowns also proper\") (Plate II.).\r\n\r\nThere are many gorgeous legends relating to augmentations and arms which\r\nare said to have been granted by William the Conqueror as rewards after the\r\nBattle of Hastings. Personally I do not believe in a single one. There was\r\na certain augmentation borne by the Dodge family, which, if it be correct,\r\ndates from the thirty-fourth year of Edward I., but whether this be\r\nauthentic it is impossible to say. Most {590} people consider the alleged\r\n_deed of grant_ a forgery, and if this be so, the arms only exist by right\r\nof subsequent record and the question of augmentation rests upon tradition.\r\nThe curious charge of the woman's breast distilling drops of milk to typify\r\nthe nourishment afforded to the king's army is at any rate most interesting\r\n(Plate VI.). The earliest undoubted one in this country that I am aware of\r\ndates from the reign of Edward III. Sir John de Pelham shared in the glory\r\nof the Battle of Poictiers, and in the capture of the French King John. To\r\ncommemorate this he was granted two round buckles with thongs. The Pelham\r\nfamily arms were \"Azure, three pelicans argent,\" and, as will be seen,\r\nthese family arms were quartered with the buckles and thongs on a field\r\ngules as an augmentation. The quarterly coat forms a part of the arms both\r\nof Lord Chichester and of Lord Yarborough at the present day, and \"the\r\nPelham buckle\" has been the badge of the Pelham family for centuries.\r\n\r\nPiers Legh fought with the Black Prince and took the Count de Tanquervil\r\nprisoner at the Battle of Crecy, \"and did valiantly rere and advance the\r\nsaid princes Banner att the bataile of Cressy to the noe little\r\nencouragement of the English army,\" but it was not until the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth that the augmentation to commemorate this was granted.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Flodden was won by the Earl of Surrey, afterwards the Duke of\r\nNorfolk, and amongst the many rewards which the King showered upon his\r\nsuccessful Marshal was the augmentation to his arms of \"a demi-lion pierced\r\nin the mouth with an arrow, depicted on the colours for the arms of the\r\nKingdom of Scotland, which the said James, late King of Scots, bore.\"\r\nAccording to the Act of Parliament under which it was granted this\r\naugmentation would seem now to belong exclusively to Lord Mowbray and\r\nStourton and Hon. Mary Petre, but it is borne apparently with official\r\nsanction, or more likely perhaps by official inadvertence, by the Duke of\r\nNorfolk and the rest of the Howard family.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Agincourt is referred to by Shakespeare, who puts these words\r\ninto King Henry's mouth on the eve of that great battle (Act iv. sc. 3):--\r\n\r\n \"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers\r\n  For he to-day that sheds his blood with me\r\n  Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,\r\n  This day shall gentle his condition.\"\r\n\r\nThere is actual foundation in fact for these lines. For in a writ couched\r\nin very stringent and severe terms issued by the same king in after years\r\ndecreeing penalties for the improper assumption and use of false arms,\r\nspecific exception is made in favour of those \"who bore {591} arms with us\r\nat the Battle of Agincourt.\" Evidently this formed a very extensive kind of\r\naugmentation.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Queen Elizabeth furnishes an interesting example of the gift\r\nof a complete coat in the case of Sir Francis Drake, who had been using the\r\narms of another family of the same name. The representative of that family\r\ncomplained to the Queen that Sir Francis, whom he styled an upstart, should\r\ntake such liberties with his arms; whereupon the Queen said she would give\r\nSir Francis arms which should outrival those of his namesake. At least,\r\nsuch is the legend, and though the arms themselves were granted by\r\nClarenceux King of Arms, and I have not yet found any Royal Warrant\r\nindicating that the grant was made by specific Royal command, it is\r\npossible the story is correct. The arms are: \"Sable, a fess wavy between\r\ntwo stars argent. Crest: a ship under reef, drawn round a terrestrial globe\r\nwith a cable by a hand issuing from clouds all proper\" (Plate VI.). The\r\nstars upon the shield are the two pole stars, and the wavy band between\r\nthem typifies Drake's voyage round the world, as does also the peculiar\r\ncrest in which the Divine hand is shown guiding his ship around the globe.\r\n\r\nAt the Battle of Naseby Dr. Edward Lake fought bravely for the King, and in\r\nthe service of his Majesty received no less than sixteen wounds. At the end\r\nof the battle, when his left arm was useless, he put the bridle of his\r\nhorse between his teeth and still fought on. The quartering of augmentation\r\ngiven to him was: \"Gules, a dexter arm embowed in armour holding in the\r\nhand a sword erect all proper, thereto affixed a banner argent charged with\r\na cross between sixteen escutcheons of the field, on the cross a lion of\r\nEngland.\" The sixteen shields upon the banner typify his sixteen wounds.\r\n\r\nAfter the Commonwealth was established in England, Charles II. made a\r\ndesperate effort to regain his crown, an effort which culminated in his\r\ndisastrous defeat at the Battle of Worcester. The King escaped through the\r\ngate of the city solely through the heroic efforts of Colonel Newman, and\r\nthis is kept in remembrance by the inescutcheon of augmentation, viz.:\r\n\"Gules, a portcullis imperially crowned or.\" Every one has heard how the\r\nKing was accompanied in his wanderings by Colonel Carlos, who hid with him\r\nin the oak tree at Boscobel. Afterwards the king accompanied Mistress Jane\r\nLane on horseback as her servant to the coast, whence he fled to the\r\nContinent. The reward of Colonel Carlos was the gift of the entire coat of\r\narms already referred to. The Lanes, though not until after some years had\r\npassed and the King had come back to his own again, were granted two\r\nremarkable additions to their family arms. First of all \"the canton of\r\nEngland\" (that is, the arms of England upon a canton) was added {592} to\r\ntheir shield. They are the _only_ family to whom such an honour has been\r\ngiven, and a most curious result has happened. When the use of armorial\r\nbearings was taxed by Act of Parliament the Royal Arms were specially\r\nexempted, and on account of this canton the Lane family claimed and\r\nobtained exemption from the tax. A few years later a crest was granted to\r\nthem, namely, a strawberry-roan horse, \"couped at the flanks,\" holding in\r\nits feet the Royal crown (Plate II.). It was upon a horse of this colour\r\nthat the King and Mistress Lane had escaped and thereby saved the crown.\r\nMr. Francis Wolfe, of Madeley, who also was a party to the escape, received\r\nthe grant of an inescutcheon gules charged with a lion of England. Another\r\nfamily which bears an augmentation to commemorate King Charles' escape is\r\nWhitgreave.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Queen Anne produced in the Duke of Marlborough one of the\r\nfinest generals the world has ever seen; and in the Battle of Blenheim one\r\nof its greatest victories. The augmentation which commemorates this is a\r\nshield bearing the cross of St. George and in the centre a smaller shield\r\nwith the golden lilies of France.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1797 the Battle of Camperdown was fought, when Admiral Duncan\r\ndefeated the Dutch Fleet and was created Lord Camperdown. To his family\r\narms were added a naval crown and a representation of the gold medal given\r\nby George III. to Lord Camperdown to commemorate his victory.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Nelson are most interesting, inasmuch as one version of the\r\narms carries two separate and distinct augmentations. It is not, however,\r\nthe coat as it was granted to and borne by the great Admiral himself. After\r\nthe Battle of the Nile he received the augmentation on the chief, a\r\nlandscape showing the palm-tree, the disabled ship, and the battery in\r\nruins. The one crest was the plume of triumph given to the Admiral by the\r\nSultan Selim III., and his second crest, which, however, is not a crest of\r\naugmentation, was the stern of the Spanish ship _San Josef._ After his\r\ndeath at the Battle of Trafalgar his brother was created Earl Nelson, and a\r\nsecond augmentation, namely, a fess wavy sable with the word \"Trafalgar\"\r\nupon it in gold letters, was added to the arms. This, however, has since\r\nbeen discontinued, except by Lord Bridport, who quarters it, whilst the\r\nNelson family has reverted to the arms as they were borne by the great\r\nAdmiral.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar, Lord Collingwood took\r\ncommand, and though naval experts think that the action of Collingwood\r\ngreatly minimised the number of prizes which would have resulted from the\r\nvictory, Lord Collingwood received for an augmentation a chief wavy gules,\r\nthereon the lion of England, navally {593} crowned, with the word\r\n\"Trafalgar\" above the lion. He also received an additional crest, namely,\r\nthe stern of his ship, the _Royal Sovereign_, between a wreath of oak on\r\nthe one side and a wreath of laurel on the other.\r\n\r\nThe heroic story of the famous fight between the _Shannon_ and the\r\n_Chesapeake_ has been often told. Captain Broke sent in a challenge to the\r\n_Chesapeake_ to come out and fight him, and, though a banquet was prepared\r\nby the Mayor of Boston for that evening \"to meet the English officers,\"\r\nCaptain Broke defeated the _Chesapeake_ in an engagement which only lasted\r\na very short time. He was granted an additional crest, namely, an arm\r\nholding a trident and issuing from a naval crown, together with the motto,\r\n\"Sævumque tridentem servamus.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Ross fought and won the Battle of Bladensburg, and took the city of\r\nWashington, dying a few days afterwards. The story is that the family were\r\noffered their choice of a baronetcy or an augmentation, and they chose the\r\nlatter. The augmentation (Plate II.), which was specially granted with\r\npermission for it to be placed upon the monument to the memory of General\r\nRoss, consists of the arm holding the flag of the United States with a\r\nbroken flag-staff which will be seen both on the shield itself, and as an\r\nadditional crest. The shield also shows the gold cross for previous\r\nservices at Corunna and in the Peninsula. The family were also given the\r\nsurname of \"Ross-of-Bladensburg.\"\r\n\r\nThe capture of Curaçoa by Admiral Sir Charles Brisbane, K.C.B., is\r\ncommemorated by the representation of his ship passing between the two\r\nDutch forts; and by the additional crest of an arm in a naval officer's\r\nuniform grasping a cutlass. Admiral Sir Robert Otway, for his distinguished\r\nservices, was granted: \"On a chief azure an anchor between two branches of\r\noak or, and on the dexter side a demi-Neptune and on the sinister a mermaid\r\nproper,\" to add to his shield. Admiral Sir George Pocock, who captured\r\nHavannah, was given for an augmentation: \"On a chief wavy azure a\r\nsea-horse\" (to typify his naval career), between two Eastern crowns (to\r\ntypify his services in the East Indies), with the word \"Havanna,\" the scene\r\nof his greatest victory.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Pellew, who was created Viscount Exmouth for bombarding and\r\ndestroying the fort and arsenal of Algiers, was given upon a chief a\r\nrepresentation of that fort, with an English man-of-war in front of it, to\r\nadd to his arms. It is interesting to note that one of his supporters,\r\nthough not a part of his augmentation, represents a Christian slave, in\r\nmemory of those in captivity at Algiers when he captured the city.\r\n\r\nThere were several augmentations won at the Battle of Waterloo, {594} and\r\nthe Waterloo medal figures upon many coats of arms of Waterloo officers.\r\nColonel Alexander Clark-Kennedy, with his own hand, captured the French\r\nEagle of the 105th French Regiment. For this he bears a representation of\r\nit and a sword crossed upon a chief over his arms, and his crest of\r\naugmentation is a demi-dragoon holding the same flag. Of the multitude of\r\nhonours which were showered upon the Duke of Wellington, not the least was\r\nhis augmentation. This was a smaller shield to be superimposed upon his\r\nown, and charged with those crosses of St. George, St. Andrew, and St.\r\nPatrick, which we term \"the Union Jack.\" Sir Edward Kerrison, who\r\ndistinguished himself so greatly in the Peninsula and at Waterloo, was\r\ngranted a sword with a wreath of laurel and representations of his medals\r\nfor Orthes and Waterloo, and, for an additional crest, an arm in armour\r\nholding a banner inscribed \"Peninsula.\"\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Munro, who will be long remembered as the Governor of Madras,\r\nwas rewarded for his capture of Badamy by a representation of that\r\nhill-fort in India. The augmentation of Lord Keane is very similar, being a\r\nrepresentation of the Fortress of Ghuznee in Afghanistan, which he\r\ncaptured. Other instances of a similar character are to be found in the\r\narms of Cockburn-Campbell and Hamilton-Grace.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Lord Gough are most remarkable, inasmuch as they show no less\r\nthan two distinct and different augmentations both earned by the same man.\r\nIn 1816, for his services in the Peninsula, he received a representation of\r\nthe Spanish Order of Charles III., and on a chief the representation of the\r\nFortress of Tarifa, with the crest of the arm holding the colours of his\r\nown regiment, the 87th, and a French eagle reversed and depressed. After\r\nhis victories in the East, particularly at Goojerat, and for the\r\nsubjugation and annexation of the Punjab, he was granted, in 1843, an\r\nadditional quartering to add to his shield. This has the Lion of England\r\nholding up the Union Jack below the words \"China\" and \"India.\" The third\r\ncrest, which was then granted to him, shows a similar lion holding the\r\nUnion Jack and a Chinese flag.\r\n\r\nSir George Pollock, \"of the Khyber Pass,\" Bart., earned everlasting fame\r\nfor himself in the first Afghan War, by forcing the Khyber Pass and by the\r\ncapture of Cabul. For this he was given an Eastern crown and the word\r\n\"Khyber\" on a chief as well as three cannon upon a canton, and at the same\r\ntime he was granted an additional crest--a lion holding an Afghan banner\r\nwith the staff thereof broken. With him it seemed as if the practice of\r\ngranting augmentations for military services had ceased. Lord Roberts has\r\nnone, neither has Lord Wolseley. But recently the old practice was reverted\r\nto in favour of Lord Kitchener. His family arms were: \"Azure, a chevron\r\ncottised {595} between three bustards,\" and in the centre chief point a\r\nbezant; with a stag's head for a crest; but for \"smashing the Khalifa\" he\r\nhas been given the Union Jack and the Egyptian flag with the staves\r\nencircled by a coronet bearing the word \"Khartoum,\" all on a pile\r\nsuperimposed over his family arms. He also received a second crest of an\r\nelephant's head holding a sword in its trunk issuing from a mural crown. At\r\nthe conclusion of the South African War a second augmentation was granted\r\nto him, this taking the form of a chief.\r\n\r\nTwo other very interesting instances of augmentation of arms are worthy of\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nSir Ralph Abercromby, after a distinguished career, fought and won the\r\nBattle of Aboukir Bay, only to die a few days later on board H.M.S.\r\n_Foudroyant_ of his wounds received in the battle. But long before he had\r\nfought and conquered the French at Valenciennes, and in 1795 had been made\r\na Knight of the Bath. The arms which are upon his Stall plate in\r\nWestminster Abbey include his augmentation, which is an arm in armour\r\nencircled by a wreath of laurel supporting the French Standard.\r\n\r\nSir William Hoste gained the celebrated victory over the French fleet off\r\nthe Island of Lissa in 1811, and the augmentation which was granted was a\r\nrepresentation of his gold medal hanging from a naval crown, and an\r\nadditional crest, an arm holding a flag inscribed with the word \"Cattaro,\"\r\nthe scene of another of his victories.\r\n\r\nPeace has its victories no less than war, but there is generally very much\r\nless fuss made about them. Consequently, the augmentations to commemorate\r\nentirely pacific actions are considerably fewer in number. The Speke\r\naugmentation has been elsewhere referred to, and reference may be made to\r\nthe Ross augmentation to commemorate the Arctic exploits of Sir John Ross.\r\n\r\nIt is a very common idea that arms were formerly to be obtained by conquest\r\nin battle. Like many other heraldic ideas, there is a certain amount of\r\ntruth in the idea, from which very erroneous generalisations have been\r\nmade. The old legend as to the acquisition of the plume of ostrich feathers\r\nby the Black Prince no doubt largely accounts for the idea. That legend, as\r\nhas been already shown, lacks foundation. Territorial or sovereign arms\r\ndoubtless would be subject to conquest, but I do not believe that because\r\nin battle or in a tournament _à outrance_ one person defeated another, he\r\ntherefore became entitled to assume, of his own motion, the arms of the man\r\nhe had vanquished. The proposition is too absurd. But there is no doubt\r\nthat in some number of historic cases his Sovereign has subsequently\r\nconferred upon the victor an augmentation which has closely approximated to\r\nthe arms of his victim. Such cases occur in the arms of the Clerkes,\r\nBarts., {596} of Hitcham, Bucks, who bear: \"On a sinister canton azure, a\r\ndemi-ram salient of the first, and in chief two fleurs-de-lis or, debruised\r\nby a baton,\" to commemorate the action of Sir John Clerke of Weston, who\r\ncaptured Louis D'Orleans, Duke of Longueville, at Borny, near Terouenne, 5\r\nHenry VII. The augmentation conferred upon the Duke of Norfolk at the\r\nbattle of Flodden has been already referred to, but the family of Lloyd of\r\nStockton, co. Salop, carry a remarkable augmentation, inasmuch as they are\r\npermitted to bear the arms of Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, to\r\ncommemorate his recapture by their ancestor after Lord Cobham's escape from\r\nthe Tower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 773.--Arms of Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland and Earl\r\nof Oxford: Quarterly, 1 and 4 (of augmentation), azure, three crowns or,\r\nwithin a bordure argent; 2 and 3, quarterly gules and or, in the first\r\nquarter a mullet argent.]\r\n\r\nAugmentations which have no other basis than mere favour of kings, or\r\nconsanguinity to the Royal Family, are not uncommon. Richard II., who\r\nhimself adopted the arms of St. Edward the Confessor, bestowed the right to\r\nbear them also upon Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk (Fig. 675). No\r\ndifference was added to them in his case, which is the more remarkable as\r\nthey were borne by the Duke impaled with the arms of England. In 1397 the\r\nKing conferred the same arms upon John de Holland, Duke of Exeter,\r\ndifferenced by a label argent, and upon Thomas de Holland, Duke of Surrey,\r\nwithin a bordure ermine. Richard II. seems to have been inclined to the\r\ngranting of augmentations, for in 1386, when he created the Earl of Oxford\r\n(Robert de Vere) Duke of Ireland, he granted him as an augmentation the\r\narms of Ireland (\"Azure, three crowns or\") within a bordure argent (Fig.\r\n773). The Manners family, who were of Royal descent, but who, not being\r\ndescended from an heiress, had no right to quarter the Royal Arms, received\r\nthe grant of a chief \"quarterly azure and gules, in the first and fourth\r\nquarters two fleurs-de-lis, and in the second and third a lion passant\r\nguardant or.\" This precedent might well be followed at the present day in\r\nthe case of the daughters of the Duke and Duchess of Fife. It was adopted\r\nin the case of Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain. The Waller family, of\r\nGroombridge, co. Kent, one of whom, Richard Waller, captured Charles, Duke\r\nof Orleans, at the battle of Agincourt, received as an augmentation the\r\nright to suspend from the crest (\"On a mount a walnut-tree proper\") an\r\nescutcheon of the arms of that Prince, viz.: \"Azure, three fleurs-de-lis\r\nor, a label of three points argent.\" Lord Polwarth bears one of the few\r\naugmentations granted by William III., viz.: \"An inescutcheon azure charged\r\nwith an orange ensigned with an Imperial crown {597} all proper,\" whilst\r\nthe titular King James III. and VIII. granted to John Græme, Earl of\r\nAlford, a coat of augmentation, viz.: \"The Royal Arms of Scotland on the\r\nfield and cross of St. Andrew counterchanged,\" the date of the grant being\r\n20th January 1734. Sir John Keith, Earl of Kintore, Knight Marischal of\r\nScotland, saved the regalia of Scotland from falling into the hands of\r\nCromwell, and in return the Keith arms (now quartered by Lord Kintore) were\r\naugmented with \"an inescutcheon gules, a sword in bend sinister surmounted\r\nby a sceptre in bend dexter, in chief an Imperial crown, the whole within\r\nan orle of eight thistles.\"\r\n\r\nThe well-known augmentation of the Seymour family: \"Or, on a pile gules,\r\nbetween six fleurs-de-lis azure,\" is borne to commemorate the marriage of\r\nJane Seymour to Henry VIII., who granted augmentations to all his wives\r\nexcept Catharine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves. The Seymour family is,\r\nhowever, the only one in which the use of the augmentation has been\r\ncontinued. The same practice was followed by granting the arms of England\r\nto the Consort of the Princess Caroline and to the late Prince Consort. See\r\npage 499.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 774.--Device from the chief of the \"Prussian Sword\r\nNobility.\"]\r\n\r\nThe frequent grant of the Royal tressure in Scotland, probably usually as\r\nan augmentation, has been already referred to. King Charles I. granted to\r\nthe Earl of Kinnoull as a quartering of augmentation: \"Azure, a unicorn\r\nsalient argent, armed, maned, and unguled or, within a bordure of the last\r\ncharged with thistles of Scotland and roses gules of England dimidiated.\"\r\nThe well-known augmentation of the Medicis family, viz.: \"A roundle azure,\r\ncharged with three fleurs-de-lis or,\" was granted by Louis XII. to Pietro\r\nde Medicis. The Prussian Officers, ennobled on the 18th of January 1896,\r\nthe twenty-fifth anniversary of the foundation of the new German Empire,\r\nbear as a device a chief purpure, and thereupon the Prussian sceptre and a\r\nsword in saltire interlaced by two oak-branches vert (Fig. 774). The late\r\nRight Hon. Sir Thomas Thornton, G.C.B., received a Royal Licence to accept\r\nthe Portuguese title of Conde de Cassilhas and an augmentation. This was an\r\ninescutcheon (ensigned by his coronet as a Conde) \"or, thereon an arm\r\nembowed vested azure, the cuff gold, the hand supporting a flagstaff\r\ntherefrom flowing the Royal Standard of Portugal.\" The same device issuing\r\nfrom his coronet was also granted to him as a crest of augmentation. Sir\r\nWoodbine Parish, K.C.H., by legislative act of the Argentine Republic\r\nreceived in 1839 a grant of {598} the arms of that country, which was\r\nsubsequently incorporated in the arms granted to him and registered in the\r\nHeralds' College in this country. He had been Consul-General and Chargé\r\nd'Affaires at Buenos Ayres, 1823-1832; he was appointed in 1824\r\nPlenipotentiary, and concluded the first treaty by which the Argentine\r\nRepublic was formally recognised. Reference has been already made (page\r\n420) to the frequent grant of supporters as augmentations, and perhaps\r\nmention should also be made of the inescutcheons for the Dukedom of\r\nAubigny, borne by the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, and for the Duchy of\r\nChatelherault, borne by the Duke of Abercorn. Possibly these should more\r\nproperly be ranked as territorial arms and not as augmentations. A similar\r\ncoat is the inescutcheon borne by the Earl of Mar and Kellie for his\r\nEarldom of Kellie. This, however, is stated by Woodward to be an\r\naugmentation granted by James VI. to Sir Thomas Erskine, one of several\r\ngranted by that King to commemorate the frustration of the Gowrie Plot in\r\n1600.\r\n\r\nThe Marquess of Westminster, for some utterly inexplicable reason, was\r\ngranted as an augmentation the right to bear the arms of the city of\r\nWestminster in the first quarter of his arms. Those who have rendered very\r\ngreat personal service to the Crown have been sometimes so favoured. The\r\nHalford and Gull (see page 250) augmentations commemorate medical services\r\nto the Royal Family, and augmentations have been conferred upon Sir\r\nFrederick Treves and Sir Francis Laking in connection with His Majesty's\r\nillness at the time of the Coronation.\r\n\r\nThe badges of Ulster and Nova Scotia borne as such upon their shields by\r\nBaronets are, of course, augmentations.\r\n\r\nTwo cases are known of augmentations to the arms of towns. The arms of\r\nDerry were augmented by the arms of the city of London in chief, when,\r\nafter its fearful siege, the name of Derry was changed to Londonderry to\r\ncommemorate the help given by the city of London. The arms of the city of\r\nHereford had an azure bordure semé of saltires couped argent added to its\r\narms after it had successfully withstood its Scottish siege, and this, by\r\nthe way, is a striking example of colour upon colour, the field of the coat\r\nbeing gules.\r\n\r\nThere are many grants in the later part of the eighteenth and the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth centuries recorded in Lyon Register which at first sight\r\nappear to be augmentations. Perhaps they are rightly so termed, but as the\r\nadditions usually appear to be granted by the Lyon without specific Royal\r\nWarrants, they are hardly equivalent to the English ones issued during the\r\nsame period. Many ordinary grants made in England which have borne direct\r\nreference to particular achievements of the grantee have been (by the\r\ngrantees and their {599} descendants) wrongly termed augmentations. A rough\r\nand ready (though not a certain) test is to imagine the coat if the\r\naugmentation be removed, and see whether it remains a properly balanced\r\ndesign. Few of such coats will survive the test. The additions made to a\r\ncoat to make it a different design, when a new grant is founded upon arms\r\nimproperly used theretofore, are not augmentations, although spoken\r\ndepartures from the truth on this detail are by no means rare. {600}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nECCLESIASTICAL HERALDRY\r\n\r\nEcclesiastical heraldry has nothing like the importance in British armory\r\nthat it possesses elsewhere. It may be said to consist in this country\r\nexclusively of the official arms assigned to and recorded for the\r\narchiepiscopal and episcopal sees, and the mitres and crosiers which are\r\nadded to the shields, and a certain number of ecclesiastical symbols which\r\noccur as charges. In Pre-Reformation days there were, of course, the many\r\nreligious houses which used armorial emblems, but with the suppression of\r\nthe monasteries these vanished. The cardinal's hat was recognised in former\r\ndays, and would still be officially certified in England as admittedly\r\ncorrectly displayed above the arms of a Roman cardinal. But the curious and\r\nintricate development of other varieties of the ecclesiastical hat which\r\nwill be found in use in all other European countries is not known to\r\nBritish armory. Nor has the English College of Arms recognised the\r\nimpersonal arms of the Catholic communities. Those arms, with and without\r\nthe ecclesiastical hats, play a conspicuous part in Continental heraldry.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to assign a proper value or a definite status to the arms\r\nof the abbeys and other religious houses in this country in Pre-Reformation\r\ntimes. The principal, in fact the only important sources of information\r\nconcerning them are the impressions of seals which have come down to us.\r\nMany of these seals show the effigies of saints or patrons, some show the\r\nimpersonal arms of the religious order to whose rule the community\r\nconformed, some the personal arms of the official of the moment, others the\r\npersonal arms of the founder. In other cases arms presumably those of the\r\nparticular foundation or community occur, but in such cases the variations\r\nin design are so marked, and so often we find that two, three, or more\r\ndevices are used indifferently and indiscriminately, that one is forced to\r\narrive at the conclusion that a large proportion of the devices in use,\r\nthough armorial in character, had no greater status than a temporary\r\nexistence as seal designs. They distinctly lack the unchanging continuity\r\none associates with armorial bearings. But whatever their status may {601}\r\nonce have been, they have now completely passed out of being and may well\r\nbe allowed to rest in the uncertainty which exists concerning them. The\r\ninterest attaching to them can never be more than academic in character and\r\nlimited in extent. The larger abbeys, the abbots of which were anciently\r\nsummoned to Parliament as Lords of Parliament, appear to have adhered\r\nrather more consistently to a fixed device in each case, though the\r\nvariations of design are very noticeable even in these instances. A list of\r\nthem will be found in the _Genealogical Magazine_ (vol. ii. p. 3).\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the monasteries in this country was so thorough and so\r\nruthless, that the contemporary instances of abbatical arms remaining to us\r\nfrom which deduction as to armorial rules and precedents can be made are\r\nsingularly few in number, but it would appear that the abbot impaled the\r\narms of his abbey on the dexter side of his personal arms, and placed his\r\nmitre above the shield.\r\n\r\nThe mitre of an abbot differed from that of a bishop, inasmuch as it had no\r\nlabels--or _infulæ_--depending from within it. The Abbot used a crosier,\r\nwhich doubtless was correctly added to his armorial bearings, but it is\r\nfound in pale behind the shield, in bend, and also two in saltire, and it\r\nis difficult to assert which was the most correct form.\r\n\r\nThe crosier of an abbot was also represented with the crook at its head\r\ncurved inwards, the terminal point of the crook being entirely contained\r\nwithin the hook. The point of a bishop's, on the other hand, was turned\r\noutwards at the bottom of the crook. The difference is said to typify the\r\ndistinction between the confined jurisdiction of the abbot--which was\r\nlimited to the abbey and the community under his charge--and the more open\r\nand wider jurisdiction of the bishop. Although this distinction has been\r\nmuch disputed as regards its recognition for the actual crosiers employed,\r\nthere can be no doubt that it is very generally adhered to in heraldic\r\nrepresentations, though one hesitates to assert it as an absolute rule. The\r\nofficial arms for the archiepiscopal and episcopal sees are of some\r\ninterest. With the single exception of York, the archiepiscopal coats of\r\narms all have, in some form or another, the pallium which forms part of an\r\narchbishop's vestments or insignia of rank, but it is now very generally\r\nrecognised and conceded that the pallium is not merely a charge in the\r\nofficial coat for any specified jurisdiction, but is itself the sign of the\r\nrank of an archbishop of the same character and status as is the mitre, the\r\npallium being displayed upon a shield as a matter of convenience for\r\nartistic representation. This view of the case has been much strengthened\r\nby the discovery that in ancient instances of the archiepiscopal arms of\r\nYork the pallium is found, and not the more modern coat of the crown and\r\nkeys; but whether the pallium is {602} to be still so considered, or\r\nwhether under English armorial law it must now be merely ranked as a charge\r\nin an ordinary coat of arms, in general practice it is accepted as the\r\nlatter; but it nevertheless remains a point of very considerable interest\r\n(which has not yet been elucidated) why the pallium should have been\r\ndiscarded for York, and another coat of arms substituted.\r\n\r\nThe various coats used by the archbishops of England and Ireland are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n_Canterbury._--Azure, an episcopal staff in pale or, and ensigned with a\r\ncross patée argent surmounted of a pall of the last, charged with four\r\ncrosses formée fitchée sable, edged and fringed or.\r\n\r\n_York._--Gules, two keys in saltire argent, in chief a Royal crown or.\r\n\r\n_Armagh._--Azure, an episcopal staff argent, ensigned with a cross patée\r\nor, surmounted by a pallium of the second, edged and fringed or, charged\r\nwith four crosses formée fitchée sable.\r\n\r\n_Dublin._--The arms of this archbishopric are the same as those of Armagh,\r\nonly with five crosses charged on the pallium instead of four.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the episcopal sees have no attribute at all similar to the\r\ncharge of the pallium in the coat of an archbishop, and are merely so many\r\ndifferent coats of arms. The shield of every bishop and archbishop is\r\nsurmounted by his mitre, and it is now customary to admit the use of the\r\nmitre by all persons holding the title of bishop who are recognised as\r\nbishops by the English law.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, includes Colonial and Suffragan bishops, retired bishops,\r\nand bishops of the Episcopal Churches in Scotland and in Ireland. It is a\r\nmoot point whether the bishops of the Episcopal Churches in Ireland and in\r\nScotland are entitled to make use of the official arms formerly assigned to\r\ntheir sees at a period when those Churches were State-established; but,\r\nlooking at the matter from a strictly official point of view, it would not\r\nappear that they are any longer entitled to make use of them.\r\n\r\nThe mitres of an archbishop and of a bishop--in spite of many statements to\r\nthe contrary--are exactly identical, and the mistaken idea which has of\r\nlate years (the practice is really quite a modern one) encircled the rim of\r\nan archbishop's mitre with the circlet of a coronet is absolutely\r\nincorrect.\r\n\r\nThere are several forms of mitre which, when looked upon as an\r\necclesiastical ornament, can be said to exist; but from the heraldic point\r\nof view only one mitre is recognised, and that is of gold, the labels being\r\nof the same colour. The jewelled variety is incorrect in armorial\r\nrepresentations, though the science of armory does not appear to have\r\nenforced any particular _shape_ of mitre.\r\n\r\nThe \"several forms\" of the mitre--to which allusion has just been {603}\r\nmade--refer to the use in actual practice which prevailed in\r\nPre-Reformation England, and still holds amongst Roman Catholic bishops at\r\nthe present day. These are three in number, _i.e._ the \"precious\"\r\n(_pretiosa_), the gold (_auriferata_), and the simple (_simplex_). The two\r\nformer are both employed at a Pontifical Mass (being alternately assumed at\r\ndifferent parts of the service); the second only is worn at such rites as\r\nConfirmation, &c.; while the third (which is purely of white linen) is\r\nconfined to Services for the Dead, and on Good Friday. As its name implies,\r\nthe first of these is of cloth of gold, ornamented to a greater or less\r\ndegree with jewels, while the second--though likewise of cloth of gold--is\r\nwithout any design or ornament. The short Gothic mitre of Norman days has\r\nnow given place to the modern Roman one, an alteration which, with its\r\ngreat height and arched sides, can hardly perhaps be considered an artistic\r\nimprovement. Some individual Roman Catholic bishops at the present day,\r\nhowever (in England at any rate), wear mitres more allied to the Norman and\r\nGothic shape.\r\n\r\nThe past fifteen or so years have seen a revival--though in a purely\r\neclectic and unofficial manner--of the _wearing_ of the mitre by Church of\r\nEngland bishops. Where this has been (and is being) done, the older form of\r\nmitre has been adhered to, though from the informal and unofficial nature\r\nof the revival no rules as to its use have been followed, but only\r\nindividual choice.\r\n\r\nAt the recent Coronation, mitres were _not_ worn; which they undoubtedly\r\nwould have been had this revival now alluded to been made authoritatively.\r\n\r\nAll bishops and archbishops are entitled to place two crosiers in saltire\r\nbehind their shields. Archbishops of the Roman Catholic Church have\r\ncontinuously placed in pale behind their shields what is known as the\r\narchbishop's cross. In actual practice, the cross carried before an\r\narchbishop is an ordinary one with one transverse piece, but the heraldic\r\narchiepiscopal cross is always represented as a double cross, _i.e._ having\r\ntwo transverse pieces one above the other. In the Established Church of\r\nEngland the archiepiscopal cross--as in the Roman Catholic Church--is the\r\nplain two-armed variety, and though the cross is never officially\r\nrecognised as an armorial attribute and is not very frequently met with in\r\nheraldic representations, there can be no doubt that if this cross is used\r\nto typify archiepiscopal rank, it should be heraldically represented with\r\nthe double arms. The actual cross borne before archbishops is termed the\r\nprovincial cross, and it may be of interest to here state that the Bishops\r\nof Rochester are the official cross-bearers to the Archbishops of\r\nCanterbury.\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing rules there is one notable exception, _i.e._ the Bishop\r\n{604} of Durham. The Bishopric of Durham, until the earlier part of the\r\nnineteenth century, was a Palatinate, and in earlier times the Bishops of\r\nDurham, who had their own parliament and Barons of the Palatinate,\r\nexercised a jurisdiction and regality, limited in extent certainly, but\r\nlittle short in fact or effect of the power of the Crown. If ever any\r\necclesiastic can be correctly said to have enjoyed temporal power, the\r\nBishops of Durham can be so described. The Prince-Bishops of the Continent\r\nhad no such attributes of regality vested in themselves as were enjoyed by\r\nthe Bishops of Durham. These were in truth kings within their bishoprics,\r\nand even to the present day--though modern geographies and modern social\r\nlegislation have divided the bishopric into other divisions--one still\r\nhears the term employed of \"within\" or \"without\" the bishopric.\r\n\r\nThe result of this temporal power enjoyed by the Bishops of Durham is seen\r\nin their heraldic achievement. In place of the two crosiers in saltire\r\nbehind the shield, as used by the other bishops, the Bishops of Durham\r\nplace a sword and a crosier in saltire behind their shield to signify both\r\ntheir temporal and spiritual jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe mitre of the Bishop of Durham is heraldically represented with the rim\r\nencircled by a ducal coronet, and it has thereby become usual to speak of\r\nthe coronetted mitre of the Bishop of Durham; but it should be clearly\r\nborne in mind that the coronet formed no part of the actual mitre, and\r\nprobably no mitre has ever existed in which the rim has been encircled by a\r\ncoronet. But the Bishops of Durham, by virtue of their temporal status,\r\nused a coronet, and by virtue of their ecclesiastical status used a mitre,\r\nand the representation of both of these at one and the same time has\r\nresulted in the coronet being placed to encircle the rim of the mitre. The\r\nresult has been that, heraldically, they are now always represented as one\r\nand the same article.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, from this coronetted mitre of Durham that the wholly\r\ninaccurate idea of the existence of coronet on the mitre of an archbishop\r\nhas originated. Apparently the humility of these Princes of the Church has\r\nnot been sufficient to prevent their appropriating the peculiar privileges\r\nof their ecclesiastical brother of lesser rank.\r\n\r\nA crest is never used with a mitre or ecclesiastical hat. Many writers deny\r\nthe right of any ecclesiastic to a crest. Some deny the right also to use a\r\nmotto, but this restriction has no general acceptance.\r\n\r\nTherefore ecclesiastical heraldry in Britain is summed up in (1) its\r\nrecognition of the cardinal's hat, (2) the official coat of arms for\r\necclesiastical purposes, (3) the ensigns of ecclesiastical rank above\r\nalluded to, viz. mitre, cross, and crosier. {605} Ecclesiastical\r\nheraldry--notably in connection with the Roman Church--in other countries\r\nhas, on the contrary, a very important place in armorial matters. In\r\naddition to the emblems officially recognised for English heraldry, the\r\necclesiastical hat is in constant use.\r\n\r\nThe use of the ecclesiastical hat is very general outside Great Britain,\r\nand affords one of the few instances where the rules governing heraldic\r\nusages are identical throughout the Continent.\r\n\r\nThis curious unanimity is the more remarkable because it was not until the\r\nseventeenth century that the rather intricate rules concerning the colours\r\nof the hats used for different ranks and the number of tassels came into\r\nvogue.\r\n\r\nOther than the occasional recognition of the cardinal's hat in former days,\r\nthe only British official instance of the use of the ecclesiastical hat is\r\nmet with in the case of the very recent matriculation of arms in Lyon\r\nRegister to Right Rev. Æneas Chisholm, the present Roman Catholic Bishop of\r\nAberdeen. I frankly admit I am unaware why the ecclesiastical hat assigned\r\nto the bishop in the official matriculation of his arms has ten tassels on\r\neither side. The Continental usage would assign him but six, and English\r\narmory has no rules of its own which can be quoted in opposition thereto.\r\nSave as an acceptance of Roman regulations (Roman Holy Orders, it should\r\nnot be forgotten, are recognised by the English Common Law to the extent\r\nthat a Roman Catholic priest is not reordained if he becomes an Anglican\r\nclergyman), the heraldic ecclesiastical hat of a bishop has no existence\r\nwith us, and the Roman regulations would give him but six tassels.\r\n\r\nThe mitre is to be met with as a charge and as a crest, for instance, in\r\nthe case of Barclay and Berkeley [\"A mitre gules, labelled and garnished\r\nor, charged with a chevron between ten crosses patée, six and four argent.\r\nMotto: 'Dieu avec nous'\"]; and also in the case of Sir Edmund Hardinge,\r\nBart., whose crests are curious [\"1. of honourable augmentation, a hand\r\nfesswise couped above the wrist habited in naval uniform, holding a sword\r\nerect surmounting a Dutch and a French flag in saltire, on the former\r\ninscribed \"Atalanta,\" on the latter \"Piedmontaise,\" the blade of the sword\r\npassing through a wreath of laurel near the point and a little below\r\nthrough another of cypress, with the motto, 'Postera laude recens;' 2. a\r\nmitre gules charged with a chevron argent, fimbriated or, thereon three\r\nescallops sable.\"]\r\n\r\nThe cross can hardly be termed exclusively ecclesiastical, but a curious\r\nfigure of this nature is to be met with in the arms recently granted to the\r\nBorough of Southwark. It was undoubtedly taken from the device used in\r\nSouthwark before its incorporation, though as there were many bodies who\r\nadopted it in that neighbourhood, it is difficult to assign it to a\r\nspecific origin. {606}\r\n\r\nPastoral staves and passion-nails are elsewhere referred to, and the\r\nfigures of saints and ecclesiastics are mentioned in the chapter on \"The\r\nHuman Figure.\"\r\n\r\nThe emblems of the saints, which appear to have received a certain amount\r\nof official recognition--both ecclesiastical and heraldic--supply the\r\norigin of many other charges not in themselves heraldic. An instance of\r\nthis kind will be found in the sword of St. Paul, which figures on the\r\nshield of London. The cross of St. Cuthbert, which has been adopted in the\r\nunauthorised coat for the See of Newcastle-on-Tyne, and the keys of St.\r\nPeter, which figure in many ecclesiastical coats, are other examples. The\r\nlilies of the Virgin are, of course, constantly to be met with in the form\r\nof fleurs-de-lis and natural flowers; the Wheel of St. Catharine is\r\nfamiliar, and the list might be extended indefinitely. {607}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nARMS OF DOMINION AND SOVEREIGNTY\r\n\r\nRoyal arms in many respects differ from ordinary armorial bearings, and it\r\nshould be carefully borne in mind that they stand, not for any particular\r\narea of land, but for the intangible sovereignty vested in the rulers\r\nthereof. They are not necessarily, nor are they in fact, hereditary. They\r\npass by conquest. A dynastic change which introduces new sovereignties\r\nintroduces new quarterings, as when the Hanoverian dynasty came to the\r\nthrone of this country the quartering of Hanover was introduced, but purely\r\npersonal arms in British heraldry are never introduced. The personal arms\r\nof Tudor and Stewart were never added to the Royal Arms of this country.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the English Royal Arms was dealt with on page 172. \"Gules,\r\nthree lions passant guardant in pale or,\" as the arms of England, were used\r\nby Kings John, Henry III., Edward I., and Edward II. The quartering for\r\nFrance was introduced by Edward III., as explained on page 274, and the\r\nRoyal shield: Quarterly 1 and 4, France, ancient (azure, semé-de-lis or); 2\r\nand 3, England (gules, three lions passant guardant in pale or), was in use\r\nin the reigns of Edward III., Richard II. (who, however, impaled his arms\r\nwith those of St. Edward the Confessor), and Henry IV. The last-mentioned\r\nking about 1411 reduced the number of fleurs-de-lis to _three_, and the\r\nshield remained without further change till the end of the reign of Edward\r\nVI. Queen Mary did not alter the arms of this country, but during the time\r\nof her marriage with Philip of Spain they were always borne impaled with\r\nthe arms of Spain. Queen Elizabeth bore the same shield as her\r\npredecessors. But when James I. came to the throne the arms were:\r\n\"Quarterly 1 and 4, quarterly i. and iiii. France, ii. and iii. England; 2.\r\nScotland (or, a lion rampant within a double tressure flory and\r\ncounterflory gules); 3. Ireland (azure, a harp or, stringed argent).\" The\r\nshield was so borne by James I., Charles I., Charles II., and James II.\r\n\r\nWhen William III. and Mary came to the throne an inescutcheon of the arms\r\nof Nassau (\"Azure, billetty and a lion rampant or\") was {608} superimposed\r\nupon the Royal Arms as previously borne, for William III., and he impaled\r\nthe same coat without the inescutcheon for his wife. At her death the\r\nimpalement was dropped. After the Union with Scotland in 1707 the arms of\r\nEngland (\"Gules, three lions,\" &c.) were _impaled_ with those of Scotland\r\n(the tressure not being continued down the palar line), and the impaled\r\ncoat of England and Scotland was placed in the first and fourth quarters,\r\nFrance in the second, Ireland in the third.\r\n\r\nAt the accession of George I. the arms of Hanover were introduced in the\r\nfourth quarter. These were: \"Tierced in pairle reversed, 1. Brunswick,\r\ngules, two lions passant guardant in pale or; 2. Luneberg, or, semé of\r\nhearts gules, a lion rampant azure; 3. (in point), Westphalia, gules, a\r\nhorse courant argent, and on an inescutcheon (over the fourth quarter)\r\ngules, the crown of Charlemagne (as Arch Treasurer of the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire).\"\r\n\r\nAt the union with Ireland in 1801 the opportunity was taken to revise the\r\nRoyal Arms, and those of France were then discontinued. The escutcheon\r\ndecided upon at that date was: \"Quarterly, 1 and 4, England; 2. Scotland;\r\n3. Ireland and the arms of Hanover were placed upon an inescutcheon.\" This\r\ninescutcheon was surmounted by the Electoral cap, for which a crown was\r\nsubstituted later when Hanover became a kingdom.\r\n\r\nAt the death of William IV., by the operation of the Salic Law, the crowns\r\nof England and Hanover were separated, and the inescutcheon of Hanover\r\ndisappeared from the Royal Arms of this country, and by Royal Warrant\r\nissued at the beginning of the reign of Queen Victoria the Royal Arms and\r\nbadges were declared to be: 1 and 4, England; 2. Scotland; 3. Ireland. The\r\nnecessary alteration of the cyphers are the only alterations made by his\r\npresent Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe supporters date from the accession of James I. Before that date there\r\nhad been much variety. Some of the Royal badges have been already alluded\r\nto in the chapter on that subject.\r\n\r\nThe differences used by various junior members of the Royal Family will be\r\nfound in the Chapter on Marks of Cadency. {609}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nHATCHMENTS\r\n\r\nA custom formerly prevailed in England, which at one time was of very\r\nconsiderable importance. This was the setting up of a hatchment after a\r\ndeath. No instances of hatchments of a very early date, as far as I am\r\naware, are to be met with, and it is probably a correct conclusion that the\r\ncustom, originating rather earlier, came into vogue in England during the\r\nseventeenth century and reached its height in the eighteenth. It doubtless\r\noriginated in the carrying of ceremonial shields and helmets (afterwards\r\nleft in the church) at funerals in the sixteenth century, and in the\r\nearlier practice of setting up in the church the actual shield of a\r\ndeceased person. The cessation of the ceremonial funeral, no doubt, led to\r\nthe cult of the hatchment. Hatchments cannot be said even yet to have come\r\nentirely to an end, but instances of their use are nowadays extremely rare,\r\nand since the early part of the nineteenth century the practice has been\r\nsteadily declining, and at the present time it is seldom indeed that one\r\nsees a hatchment _in use_. The word \"hatchment\" is, of course, a corruption\r\nof the term \"achievement,\" this being the heraldic term implying an\r\nemblazonment of the full armorial bearings of any person.\r\n\r\nThe manner of use was as follows. Immediately upon the death of a person of\r\nany social position a hatchment of his or her arms was set up over the\r\nentrance to his house, which remained there for twelve months, during the\r\nperiod of mourning. It was then taken down from the house and removed to\r\nthe church, where it was set up in perpetuity. There are few churches of\r\nany age in this country which do not boast one or more of these hatchments,\r\nand some are rich in their possession. Those now remaining--for example, in\r\nSt. Chad's Church in Shrewsbury--must number, I imagine, over a hundred.\r\nThere does not appear to have been any obligation upon a clergyman either\r\nto permit their erection, or to allow them to remain for any specified\r\nperiod. In some churches they have been discarded and relegated to the\r\nvestry, to the coal-house, or to the rubbish-heap, whilst in others they\r\nhave been carefully preserved.\r\n\r\nThe hatchment was a diamond-shaped frame, painted black, and {610}\r\nenclosing a painting in oils upon wood, or more frequently canvas, of the\r\nfull armorial bearings of the deceased person. The frame was usually about\r\nfive feet six in height, and the rules for the display of arms upon\r\nhatchments afford an interesting set of regulations which may be applied to\r\nother heraldic emblazonments. The chief point, however, concerning a\r\nhatchment, and also the one in which it differs from an ordinary armorial\r\nemblazonment, lay in the colour of the groundwork upon which the armorial\r\nbearings were painted. For an unmarried person the whole of the groundwork\r\nwas black, but for a husband or wife half was black and half white, the\r\ngroundwork behind the arms of the deceased person being black, and of the\r\nsurviving partner in matrimony white. The background for a widow or widower\r\nwas entirely black. {611}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nTHE UNION JACK\r\n\r\nBY REV. J. R. CRAWFORD\r\n\r\nOrders in Council and other official documents refer to this flag as the\r\nUnion Flag, The Union Jack, Our Jack, The King's Colours, and the Union\r\nBanner, which last title precise Heraldry usually adopts. In patriotic\r\nsongs it is toasted as \"The Red, White, and Blue,\" whilst in the Services\r\nmen affectionately allude to it as \"the dear old duster.\" But Britons at\r\nlarge cling to the title which heads this chapter; to them it is \"_The\r\nUnion Jack_.\"\r\n\r\n_Why Union?_ Obviously because it unites three emblems of tutelar saints on\r\none flag, and thereby denotes the union of three peoples under one\r\nSovereign. It is the motto \"_Tria juncta in Uno_\" rendered in bunting.\r\n\r\n_Why Jack?_ Two theories are propounded, one fanciful, the other probable.\r\nSome say \"Jack\" is the anglicised form of \"Jacques,\" which is the French\r\nsignature of James I., in whose reign and by whose command the first Union\r\nFlag was called into being. Against this at least three reasons may justly\r\nbe urged: (1) The term \"_Jack_\" does not appear--so far as we can\r\ndiscover--in any warrant referring to the Jacobean Flag of 1606. It is\r\nrather in later documents that this term occurs. (2) If the earliest Union\r\nFlag be a \"_Jack_\" just because it is the creation of James, then surely it\r\nfollows that, to be consistent, later Union Flags, the creations of later\r\nsovereigns, should have borne those Sovereigns' names; for example _The\r\nUnion Anne_, _The Union George_! (3) The English way of pronouncing\r\n\"Jacques\" is not, and probably never was _Jack_, but _Jaikes_. The other,\r\nand more feasible theory, is as follows: The term \"Jaque\" (e.g. _jaque de\r\nmailles_) was borrowed from the French and referred to any jacket or coat\r\non which, especially, heraldic emblems were blazoned. In days long prior to\r\nthose of the first Stuart king, mention is made of \"WHYTTE COTES WITH RED\r\nCROSSES WORN BY SHYPPESMEN AND MEN OF THE CETTE OF LONDON,\" from which\r\nsentence we learn that the emblem of the nation's tutelar saint was (as in\r\nyet earlier Crusaders' days) a _fighter's_ emblem. When such emblem or\r\nemblems were transferred to a flag, {612} the term _Jaque_ may well, in\r\ncourse of time, have been also applied to that flag, as previously to the\r\njacket.\r\n\r\nGlance now at the story of those Orders in Council which created the\r\nvarious Union flags. The very union of the two kingdoms of England and\r\nScotland seems to have accentuated the pettier national jealousies, so that\r\nSouthrons annoyed Northerners by hoisting the St. George above the St.\r\nAndrew, and the Scotchmen retaliated by a species of _tu quoque_. The King\r\nsought to allay these quarrels by creating a British, as other than a\r\npurely English or Scottish, flag. But let the Proclamation speak for\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n    \"_By the King._\r\n\r\n    \"_Whereas, some differences hath arisen between Our subjects of South\r\n    and North Britaine travelling by Seas, about the bearing of their\r\n    Flagges: For the avoiding of all contentions hereafter, Wee have, with\r\n    the advice of our Councill, ordered: That from henceforth all our\r\n    Subjects of this Isle and Kingdome of Great Britaine, and all our\r\n    members thereof, shall beare in their main-toppe the Red Crosse,\r\n    commonly called St. George's Crosse, and the White Crosse, commonly\r\n    called St. Andrew's Crosse, joyned together according to the forme made\r\n    by our heralds, and sent by Us to our Admerall to be published to our\r\n    Subjects: and in their fore-toppe our Subjects of South Britaine shall\r\n    weare the Red Crosse onely as they were wont, and our Subjects of North\r\n    Britaine in their fore-toppe the White Crosse onely as they were\r\n    accustomed._\"--1606.\r\n\r\nThis attempt at conciliating differences deserved but did not win success.\r\n\"_The King's Owne Shipps_\" deemed themselves slighted, since all vessels\r\nwere treated alike in this matter, and so persistent was the agitation that\r\nat last, in Charles I.'s reign (1634), another Proclamation was issued\r\n\"_for the honour of Oure Shipps in Oure Navie Royall_,\" whereby those ships\r\nalone had the right of hoisting \"_the Union Flagge_.\" The days of the\r\nCommonwealth brought another change, for with the King the King's Flag\r\ndisappeared. The Protector caused two new flags to be made, viz. _The Great\r\nUnion_ (a flag little used, however, although it figured at his funeral\r\nobsequies), and which may be thus blazoned: _Quarterly 1 and 4, The St.\r\nGeorge_; 2. _The St. Andrew_; 3. _azure, a harp or, for Ireland; over all\r\non an inescutcheon of pretence, sable, a lion rampant or_, for the\r\nProtector's personal arms, and _The Commonwealth Ensign_, which latter\r\nParliament treated as the paramount flag. The most interesting features of\r\nthis flag are that it was of three kinds, one red, one white, one blue, and\r\nthat Ireland but not Scotland had a place on its folds. When the King came\r\nto {613} his own again yet another change was witnessed. By this\r\nProclamation ships in the Navy were to carry _The Union_, and all\r\nmerchantmen _The St. George_, whilst these latter vessels were also to wear\r\n\"_The Red Ensign with the St. George, on a Canton_.\" Passing on, we reach\r\nthe days of Queen Anne, who as soon as the union of the two Parliaments was\r\naccomplished, issued a famous Proclamation often quoted. Suffice it here to\r\noutline its effect.\r\n\r\nPLATE IX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 775.]\r\n\r\nThe two crosses of _St. George_ and _St. Andrew_ were--as the Treaty of\r\nUnion had agreed should be--\"_conjoyned in such a manner as we should think\r\nfit_\"; and what that manner was is \"_described on the margent_\" in the\r\nshape of a sketch. But further, in place of the _St. George_ being placed\r\non the canton of the _Red Ensign_ of Charles II. (itself the _Commonwealth\r\nEnsign, minus_ the harp) the Proclamation ordered the \"_Union_\" as a\r\ncanton, and finally this new Red Ensign was confined to the merchant ships,\r\nwhilst \"_Our Jack_\" was reserved for the use of the Navy, unless by\r\nparticular warrant. Thus things continued until the union of Ireland with\r\nEngland and Scotland. The Proclamation referring to this Act of Union\r\ncloses with the Herald's verbal blazon of the full Union Flag:--\"_The Union\r\nFlag shall be Azure, the Crosses Saltire of St. Andrew and St. Patrick,\r\nQuarterly per saltire, countercharged Argent and Gules, the latter\r\nfimbriated of the second, surmounted by the Cross of St. George of the\r\nthird, fimbriated as the Saltire._\" Thus the Union, as displayed in\r\nbunting, was perfected.\r\n\r\nOur _Union Flag_ is very remarkable, even amongst the flags of Christendom,\r\nboth as a blending of crosses, and crosses only, and also as an emblem of\r\nthe union of two or more countries. Yet it is not unique, for the flags of\r\nDenmark, Sweden, and Norway have a somewhat similar story to tell. The last\r\ntwo countries separated at {614} different dates from Denmark, and then\r\ntogether formed a United Scandinavian Kingdom. In separating, they each\r\ntook to themselves a separate flag, and again, in uniting, they called into\r\nbeing a Union Banner. How they treated these changes Fig. 775 will\r\nillustrate. Notwithstanding these acts of union both Scandinavians and\r\nBritons have had, and we still have, differences over these Union Flags.\r\nWhilst, however, they based their protests on the sentiment of\r\nindependence, we ground our grumblings on questions of heraldic precedence,\r\nand of the interpretation of verbal blazons. Leaving our neighbours to\r\nsettle their differences, let us examine our own. Take the subject of\r\nprecedence. Very early in the flag's history, Scotsmen were indignant\r\nbecause the St. Andrew was not placed over the St. George. All kinds of\r\nvariations have been suggested to lessen this crux of precedence, but such\r\nattempts must plainly be in vain. Do what you will, some kind of precedence\r\nis unavoidable. The _St. George_, then, as representing the paramount\r\npartner, occupies the centre of the flag, whilst the _St. Andrew_, as\r\nsenior in partnership to the _St. Patrick_, is placed _above the St.\r\nPatrick, in the first quarter_, although throughout it is counterchanged.\r\nThe words in italic are important, for when the order is reversed, then\r\nthat particular flag is flying upside down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 776.--The Union Flag of 1707.]\r\n\r\nThe mode of procedure in creating flags has been much the same from one\r\nreign to another. Briefly it is this: The Sovereign seeks the advice of,\r\nand receives a report from, the Lords of the Privy Council. These\r\ncouncillors are \"_attended by the King of Arms and Heralds, with diverse\r\ndrafts prepared by them_.\" A decision being arrived at, an Order in\r\nCouncil, followed by a Royal Proclamation, makes known the character of the\r\nflag. In both Order and Proclamation it is usual to make reference to the\r\nverbal blazon, and to \"_the form made by our heralds_.\" Thus there are\r\nthree agents recognised--(1) the Sovereign, the fountain of all honours;\r\n(2) the heralds, who authoritatively blazon, outline, and register all\r\nachievements; and (3) the naval authority, as that in which are vested the\r\nduty and the power of seeing the actual bunting properly made up and\r\nproperly flown. {615}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 777.--The Union Flag of 1801.]\r\n\r\nIn keeping with this, the general mode of procedure, the Proclamations\r\ndemand our attention. The Proclamation of James (1606). A high official of\r\nthe College of Arms informs us that neither verbal blazon nor drawing of\r\nthe first Union Flag is extant. On the other hand, in the Proclamations of\r\n1707 and 1801 we have both blazon and drawing. The blazon has already been\r\ngiven of the 1801 flag (which is the one most needing a verbal blazon), and\r\nthe drawings of both flags we here produce (Figs. 776 and 777). These\r\ndrawings--though slightly reduced in these pages--are most careful copies\r\nof the _signed_ copies supplied to us by the official already alluded to.\r\nIn forwarding them he writes: \"_They are not drawn to scale_;\" and he adds,\r\nfurther on, \"_they are exactly the same size as recorded in our books_.\" So\r\nthen we have, in these two drawings, the heralds' interpretation, _at the\r\ntime_, of their own verbal blazon. Now comes the Admiralty part of the\r\nwork. In the Admiralty Regulations we have a \"_Memorandum relative to the\r\norigin of the Union Flag in its present form_.\" In this there is a brief\r\nhistory of the changes made in the flag from time to time, with quotations\r\nfrom the warrants, together with the verbal blazon AND two coloured\r\ndrawings (Figs. 778 and 779). The Admiralty has also appended to the\r\nMemorandum the following interesting and ingeniously worked out _Table of\r\nProportions, adapted for a flag 15 feet by 7½ feet_. Presumably this table\r\nforms the basis upon which all Union Flags are made up under Admiralty\r\nsupervision:--\r\n\r\n                                                            ft. in.\r\n  The + of  { St. George              1/5  } together 1/3  { 1   6 } 1/3\r\n            { Two borders 1/15 each   2/15 }               { 1   0 }\r\n\r\n            { St. Patrick             1/15 } together 1/10 { 0   6 }\r\n  The × of  { Its border              1/30 }               { 0   3 } 1/5\r\n            { St. Andrew              1/10                   0   9 }\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 778.--Admiralty Pattern of 1707 Flag.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 779.--Admiralty Pattern of 1801 Flag.]\r\n\r\nThe student of heraldry will observe that this table is based on the\r\nproportions of the Ordinaries and Sub-Ordinaries figuring on the flag, as\r\nthose proportions are regulated by English Rules of Armory. These rules\r\ngive a cross as 1/3, a saltire as 1/5, a fimbriation about 1/20, of {616}\r\nthe flag's width. By the way, we notice here, yet only to dismiss it as\r\nhypercritical, the objection taken to the employment (in the verbal blazon\r\nof 1801) of the term \"_fimbriated_.\" To our mind this objection seems a\r\nstorm in a teacup. Further, it is always admissible in armory to lessen the\r\nsize of charges when these crowd a field, and although we are fully aware\r\nthat the laws of armory are not always nor all of them applied to flags,\r\nyet there is sufficient evidence to show that the heralds and the Admiralty\r\ndid recognise the cases of shields and flags to be somewhat analogous. But\r\nthere are two features in _The Admiralty pattern_ which cannot but arrest\r\nthe attention of all those who have made a study of armory. The one is that\r\nthe sub-ordinaries, _i.e._ the fimbriations, have different proportions\r\ngiven to them, although they are repetitions of the same sub-ordinary, and\r\nalso seem guarded against such treatment by the very wording of the blazon,\r\nand by the practice usual in such cases. And the other is that, after\r\ncounterchanging the saltires, the St. Patrick is attenuated by having its\r\nfimbriation taken off its own field, instead (as the common custom is) off\r\nthe field of the flag.\r\n\r\nAll Warrants dealing with flags provide for their being flown _at sea_\r\n(Queen Anne's Proclamation is apparently the first that adds \"_and land_\"),\r\nand gradually reserve for the Royal Navy--or fighting ships--the honour of\r\nalone bearing the Union Jack. The accompanying diagram shows at a glance\r\nthe changes made by the several Proclamations. The latest word on this\r\nsubject is \"The Merchant Shipping (Colours) Act of Queen Victoria, 1894.\"\r\nThis Acts sets forth among other things that--(1) \"_The red ensign usually\r\nworn by merchant ships, without any defacement or modification whatsoever,\r\nis hereby declared to be the proper national colours for all ships and\r\nboats belonging to any British subject, except in the case of Her Majesty's\r\nships or boats, or in the case of any other ship or boat for the time being\r\nallowed to wear any other national colours in {617} pursuance of a warrant\r\nfrom Her Majesty or from the Admiralty._ (2) _If any distinctive national\r\ncolours except such red ensign, or except the Union Jack with a white\r\nborder, or if any colours usually worn by Her Majesty's ships, &c. ... are\r\nor is hoisted on board any ship ... without warrant ... for each offence\r\n... a fine not exceeding five hundred pounds._\" {618}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n\"SEIZE-QUARTIERS\"\r\n\r\nPROOF OF ANCESTRY\r\n\r\nIf any heraldic term has been misunderstood in this country,\r\n\"Seize-Quartiers\" is that term. One hears \"Seize-Quartiers\" claimed right\r\nand left, whereas in British armory it is only on the very rarest occasions\r\nthat proof of it can be made. In England there is not, and never has been,\r\nfor any purpose a real \"test\" of blood. By the statutes of various Orders\r\nof Knighthood, esquires of knights of those orders are required to show\r\nthat their grandparents were of gentle birth and entitled to bear arms, and\r\na popular belief exists that Knights of Justice of the Order of the\r\nHospital of St. John of Jerusalem in England need to establish some test of\r\nbirth. The wording of the statute, however, is very loose and vague, and in\r\nfact, judging from the names and arms of some of the knights, must be\r\npretty generally ignored. But Peer, K.G., or C.B., alike need pass no test\r\nof birth. The present state of affairs in this country is the natural\r\noutcome of the custom of society, which always recognises the wife as of\r\nthe husband's status, whatever may have been her antecedents, unless the\r\ndiscrepancy is too glaring to be overlooked. In England few indeed care or\r\nquestion whether this person or that person has even a coat of arms; and in\r\nthe decision of Society upon a given question as to whether this person or\r\nthe other has \"married beneath himself,\" the judgment results solely from\r\nthe circle in which the wife and her people move. By many this curious\r\nresult is claimed as an example of, and as a telling instance to\r\ndemonstrate, the broad-minded superiority of the English race, as evidenced\r\nby the equality which this country concedes between titled and untitled\r\nclasses, between official and unofficial personages, between the\r\nland-owning and the mercantile communities. But such a conclusion is most\r\nsuperficial. We draw no distinction, and rightly so, between titled and\r\nuntitled amongst the few remaining families who have held and owned their\r\nlands for many generations; but outside this class the confusion is great,\r\nand to a close observer it is plainly enough apparent that great\r\ndistinctions are drawn. But they are often mistaken ones. That the rigid\r\nand definite dividing {619} line between patrician and plebeian, which\r\nstill exists so much more markedly upon the Continent, can only be traced\r\nmost sketchily in this country is due to two causes--(1) the fact that in\r\nearly days, when Society was slowly evolving itself, many younger sons of\r\ngentle families embarked upon commercial careers, natural family affection,\r\nbecause of such action, preventing a rigid exclusion from the ranks of\r\nSociety of every one tainted by commerce; (2) the absence in this country\r\nof any equivalent of the patent distinguishing marks \"de,\" \"van,\" or \"von,\"\r\nwhich exist among our neighbours in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe result has been that in England there is no possible way (short of\r\nspecific genealogical investigation) in which it can be ascertained whether\r\nany given person is of gentle birth, and the corollary of this\r\nlast-mentioned fact is that any real test is ignored. There are few\r\nfamilies in this country, outside the Roman Catholic aristocracy (whose\r\nmarriages are not quite so haphazard as are those of other people), who can\r\nshow that all their sixteen great-great-grandparents were in their own\r\nright entitled to bear arms. That is the true definition of the \"Proof of\r\nSeize-Quartiers.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, to prove Seize-Quartiers you must show this right to have\r\nexisted for\r\n\r\n       Self.  Parents.
