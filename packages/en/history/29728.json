It is shown as {Rx}\r\nin this version of the etext.\r\n\r\nSome letters have a macron (straight line) above them; these are\r\nindicated as {=x}, with x being the particular letter.\r\n\r\nThe book uses both upper and lower case oe ligatures. These are shown\r\nas {OE} and {oe} respectively.\r\n\r\nThe many inconsistencies in hyphenation and use of accents and\r\nligatures have been preserved as printed, with a few exceptions.\r\nVariable and archaic spelling has also been preserved. A full\r\nlist of amendments and other notes follow the end of the book.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of the recipe and page numbers in the\r\nindex are incorrect; however, they have been preserved as\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        APICIUS\r\n\r\n          COOKERY AND DINING IN IMPERIAL ROME\r\n\r\n A Bibliography, Critical Review and Translation of the\r\n    Ancient Book known as _Apicius de re Coquinaria_\r\n\r\n      NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME RENDERED INTO ENGLISH\r\n\r\n                          BY\r\n                JOSEPH DOMMERS VEHLING\r\n\r\n  _With a Dictionary of Technical Terms, Many Notes,\r\n  Facsimiles of Originals, and Views and Sketches of\r\n     Ancient Culinary Objects Made by the Author_\r\n\r\n        INTRODUCTION BY PROF.

The\r\nbook has been printed again and again in Latin and has been translated\r\ninto Italian and German. It is unnecessary to here give historic\r\ndetails regarding the work as Mr. Vehling goes fully and admirably\r\ninto the subject. In 1705 the book was printed in Latin at London,\r\nwith notes by Dr. Martinus Lister. It caused some stir in the England\r\nof that time. In a very curious book, The Art of Cookery, in Imitation\r\nof Horace's Art of Poetry, with Some Letters to Dr. Lister and Others,\r\nDr. Wm. King says:\r\n\r\n    \"The other curiosity is the admirable piece of C{oe}lius\r\n    Apicius, '_De Opsoniis et condimentis sive arte\r\n    coquinaria, Libri decem_' being ten books of soups and\r\n    sauces, and the art of cookery, as it is excellently\r\n    printed for the doctor, who in this important affair, is\r\n    not sufficiently communicative....\r\n\r\n    \"I some days ago met with an old acquaintance, of whom I\r\n    inquired if he has seen the book concerning soups and\r\n    sauces? He told me he had, but that he had but a very\r\n    slight view of it, the person who was master of it not\r\n    being willing to part with so valuable a rarity out of\r\n    his closet. I desired him to give me some account of it.\r\n    He says that it is a very handsome octavo, for, ever\r\n    since the days of Ogilvy, good paper and good print, and\r\n    fine cuts, make a book become ingenious and brighten up\r\n    an author strangely. That there is a copious index; and\r\n    at the end a catalogue of all the doctor's works,\r\n    concerning cockles, English beetles, snails, spiders,\r\n    that get up into the air and throw us down cobwebs; a\r\n    monster vomited up by a baker and such like; which if\r\n    carefully perused, would wonderfully improve us.\"\r\n\r\nMore than two hundred years have passed and we now have an edition of\r\nthis curious work in English. And our edition has nothing to lose by\r\ncomparison with the old one. For this, too, is a handsome book, with\r\ngood paper and good print and fine cuts. And the man who produces it\r\ncan equally bear comparison with Dr. Lister and more earlier\r\ncommentators and editors whom he quotes--Humelbergius and Caspar\r\nBarthius.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of such a book is no simple task and requires a rare\r\ncombination of qualities. Mr. Vehling possesses this unusual\r\ncombination. He was born some forty-five years ago in the small town\r\nof Duelken on the German-Dutch frontier--a town proverbial for the\r\ndullness of its inhabitants. There was nothing of dullness about the\r\nboy, however, for at the age of fourteen years, he had already four\r\nyears study of Latin and one of Greek to his credit. Such was his\r\nrecord in Latin that his priest teachers attempted to influence him\r\ntoward the priesthood. His family, however, had other plans and\r\nbelieving that he had enough schooling, decided that he should be a\r\ncook. As he enjoyed good food, had a taste for travel and\r\nindependence, and was inclined to submit to family direction, he\r\nrather willingly entered upon the career planned for him. He learned\r\nthe business thoroughly and for six years practiced his art in\r\nGermany, Belgium, France, England and Scandinavia. Wherever he went,\r\nhe gave his hours of freedom to reading and study in libraries and\r\nmuseums.\r\n\r\nDuring his first trip through Italy and on a visit to Pompeii he\r\nconceived the idea of depicting some day the table of the Romans and\r\nof making the present translation. He commenced to gather all the\r\nnecessary material for this work, which included intensive studies of\r\nthe ancient arts and languages. Meanwhile, he continued his hotel work\r\nalso, quite successfully. At the age of twenty-four he was assistant\r\nmanager of the fashionable Hotel Bristol, Vienna.\r\n\r\nHowever, the necessities of existence prevented his giving that time\r\nand study to art, which is necessary if it was to become a real\r\ncareer. In Vienna he found music, drama, languages, history,\r\nliterature and gastronomy, and met interesting people from all parts\r\nof the globe. While the years at Vienna were the happiest of his life,\r\nhe had a distaste for the \"superheated, aristocratic and military\r\natmosphere.\" It was at that city that he met the man who was\r\nresponsible for his coming to America. Were we writing Mr. Vehling's\r\nbiography, we would have ample material for a racy and startling\r\nnarrative. We desire only to indicate the remarkable preparation for\r\nthe work before us, which he has had. A Latin scholar of exceptional\r\npromise, a professional cook of pronounced success, and an artist\r\ncompetent to illustrate his own work! Could such a combination be\r\nanticipated? It is the combination that has made this book possible.\r\n\r\nThe book has claims even upon our busy and practical generation. Mr.\r\nVehling has himself stated them:\r\n\r\n    \"The important addition to our knowledge of the\r\n    ancients--for our popular notions about their table are\r\n    entirely erroneous and are in need of revision.\r\n\r\n    \"The practical value of many of the ancient formulæ--for\r\n    'In Olde Things There is Newnesse.'\r\n\r\n    \"The human interest--because of the amazing mentality\r\n    and the culinary ingenuity of the ancients revealed to\r\n    us from an altogether new angle.\r\n\r\n    \"The curious novelty and the linguistic difficulty, the\r\n    philological interest and the unique nature of the task,\r\n    requiring unique prerequisites--all these factors\r\n    prompted us to undertake this translation.\"\r\n\r\nOne word as to Mr. Vehling's work in America. He was for five years\r\nmanager of catering at the Hotel Pfister in Milwaukee; for two and a\r\nhalf years he was inspector and instructor of the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway; he was connected with some of the leading hotels in New York\r\nCity, and with the Eppley and the Van Orman Hotels chains, in\r\nexecutive capacity. He not only has the practical side of food use and\r\npreparation, he is an authority upon the science in his field. His\r\nprinted articles on food and cookery have been read with extraordinary\r\ninterest, and his lectures upon culinary matters have been well\r\nreceived. It is to be hoped that both will eventually be published in\r\nbook form.\r\n\r\nThere is no financial lure in getting out an English translation of\r\nApicius. It is a labor of love--but worth the doing. We have claimed\r\nthat Mr. Vehling has exceptional fitness for the task. This will be\r\nevident to anyone who reads his book. An interesting feature of his\r\npreparation is the fact that Mr. Vehling has subjected many of the\r\nformulæ to actual test. As Dr. Lister in the old edition of 1705\r\nincreased the value and interest of the work by making additions from\r\nvarious sources, so our editor of today adds much and interesting\r\nmatter in his supplements, notes and illustrations.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly expected that many will follow Mr. Vehling in testing the\r\nApician formulæ. Hazlitt in speaking of \"The Young Cook's Monitor\"\r\nwhich was printed in 1683, says:\r\n\r\n    \"Some of the ingredients proposed for sauces seem to our\r\n    ears rather prodigious. In one place a contemporary\r\n    peruser has inserted an ironical calculation in MS. to\r\n    the effect that, whereas a cod's head could be bought\r\n    for fourpence, the condiments recommended for it were\r\n    not to be had for less than nine shillings.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall close with a plagiarism oft repeated. It was a plagiarism as\r\nlong ago as 1736, when it was admitted such in the preface of Smith's\r\n\"The Compleat Housewife\":\r\n\r\n    \"It being grown as fashionable for a book now to appear\r\n    in public without a preface, as for a lady to appear at\r\n    a ball without a hoop-petticoat, I shall conform to the\r\n    custom for fashion-sake and not through any necessity.\r\n    The subject being both common and universal, needs no\r\n    argument to introduce it, and being so necessary for the\r\n    gratification of the appetite, stands in need of no\r\n    encomiums to allure persons to the practice of it; since\r\n    there are but a few nowadays who love not good eating\r\n    and drinking....\"\r\n\r\nOld Apicius and Joseph Dommers Vehling really need no introduction.\r\n\r\n                                                 FREDERICK STARR\r\n    Seattle, Washington, August 3, 1926.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present first translation into English of the ancient cookery book\r\ndating back to Imperial Roman times known as the Apicius book is\r\nherewith presented to antiquarians, friends of the Antique as well as\r\nto gastronomers, friends of good cheer.\r\n\r\nThree of the most ancient manuscript books that exist today bearing\r\nthe name of Apicius date back to the eighth and ninth century. Ever\r\nsince the invention of printing Apicius has been edited chiefly in the\r\nLatin language. Details of the manuscript books and printed editions\r\nwill be found under the heading of Apiciana on the following pages.\r\n\r\nThe present version has been based chiefly upon three principal Latin\r\neditions, that of Albanus Torinus, 1541, who had for his authority a\r\ncodex he found on the island of Megalona, on the editions of Martinus\r\nLister, 1705-9, who based his work upon that of Humelbergius, 1542,\r\nand the Giarratano-Vollmer edition, 1922.\r\n\r\nWe have also scrutinized various other editions forming part of our\r\ncollection of Apiciana, and as shown by our \"family tree of Apicius\"\r\nhave drawn either directly or indirectly upon every known source for\r\nour information.\r\n\r\nThe reasons and raison d'être for this undertaking become sufficiently\r\nclear through Dr. Starr's introduction and through the following\r\ncritical review.\r\n\r\nIt has been often said that the way to a man's heart is through his\r\nstomach; so here is hoping that we may find a better way of knowing\r\nold Rome and antique private life through the study of this cookery\r\nbook--Europe's oldest and Rome's only one in existence today.\r\n\r\n                                                        J.

Each end of the long handle takes the form of a\r\nbird's head.

This allows the bowl to tilt sufficiently to hold\r\nits full contents when retired from the narrow opening of the amphora.\r\nThe ancients also had dippers with extension handles to reach down to\r\nthe bottom of the deep amphora.

Then as now the oft quoted maxim stands that man is what he\r\neats.\r\n\r\nMuch of the ancient life is still shrouded and will forever be hidden\r\nby envious forces that have covered up bygone glory and grandeur.\r\nGround into mealy dust under the hoofs of barbarian armies!\r\nRe-modeled, re-used a hundred times! Discarded as of no value by\r\nclumsy hands! The \"Crime of Ignorance\" is a factor in league with the\r\nforces of destruction. Much is destroyed by blind strokes of\r\nfate--fate, eternally pounding this earth in its everlasting enigmatic\r\nefforts to shape life into something, the purpose of which we do not\r\nunderstand, the meaning of which we may not even venture to dream of\r\nor hope to know.\r\n\r\nWhatever there has been preserved by \"Providence,\" by freaks of chance,\r\nby virtue of its own inherent strength--whatever has been buried by\r\nmisers, fondled, treasured by loving hands of collectors and\r\nconnoisseurs during all these centuries--every speck of ancient dust,\r\nevery scrap of parchment or papyrus, a corroded piece of metal, a\r\nbroken piece of stone or glass, so eagerly sought by the archaeologists\r\nand historians of the last few generations--all these fragmentary\r\nmessages from out of the past emphasize the greatness of their time.\r\nThey show its modernity, its nearness to our own days. They are now\r\nhazy reminiscences, as it were, by a middle-aged man of the hopes and\r\nthe joys of his own youth. These furtive fragments--whatever they\r\nare--now tell us a story so full and so rich, they wield so marvelous a\r\npower, no man laying claim to possessing any intelligence may pass them\r\nwithout intensely feeling the eternal pathetic appeal to our hearts of\r\nthese bygone ages that hold us down in an envious manner, begrudging us\r\nthe warm life-blood of the present, weaving invisible ties around us to\r\nmake our hearts heavy.\r\n\r\nHowever, we are not here to be impeded by any sentimental\r\nconsiderations. Thinking of the past, we are not so much concerned\r\nwith the picture that dead men have placed in our path like ever so\r\nmany bill boards and posters! We do not care for their \"ideals\"\r\nexpounded in contemporary histories and eulogies. We are hardly moved\r\nby the \"facts\" such as they would have loved to see them happen, nor do\r\nwe cherish the figments of their human, very human, subconsciousness.\r\n\r\nTo gain a correct picture of the Roman table we will therefore set\r\naside for a while the fragments culled from ancient literature and\r\nhistory that have been misused so indiscriminately and so profusely\r\nduring the last two thousand years--for various reasons. They have\r\nbecome fixed ideas, making reconstruction difficult for anyone who\r\nwould gain a picture along rational lines. Barring two exceptions,\r\nthere is no trustworthy detailed description of the ancient table by\r\nan objective contemporary observer. To be sure, there are some\r\nsporadic efforts, mere reiterations. The majority of the ancient word\r\npictures are distorted views on our subject by partisan writers,\r\ncontemporary moralists on the one side, satirists on the other.\r\nNeither of them, we venture to say, knew the subject professionally.\r\nThey were not specialists in the sense of modern writers like\r\nReynière, Rumohr, Vaerst; nor did they approach in technical knowledge\r\nmedieval writers like Martino, Platina, Torinus.\r\n\r\nTrue there were exceptions. Athenaeus, a most prolific and voluble\r\nmagiric commentator, quoting many writers and specialists whose names\r\nbut for him would have never reached posterity. Athenaeus tells about\r\nthese gastronomers, the greatest of them, Archestratos, men who might\r\nhave contributed so much to our knowledge of the ancient world, but to\r\nus these names remain silent, for the works of these men have perished\r\nwith the rest of the great library at the disposal of this genial host\r\nof Alexandria.\r\n\r\nToo, there are Anacharsis and Petronius. They and Athenaeus cannot be\r\noverlooked. These three form the bulk of our evidence.\r\n\r\nTake on the other hand Plutarch, Seneca, Tertullian, even Pliny,\r\nwriters who have chiefly contributed to our defective knowledge of the\r\nancient table. They were no gourmets. They were biased, unreliable at\r\nbest, as regards culinary matters. They deserve our attention merely\r\nbecause they are above the ever present mob of antique reformers and\r\npoliticians of whom there was legion in Rome alone, under the pagan\r\nrégime. Their state of mind and their intolerance towards civilized\r\ndining did not improve with the advent of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe moralists' testimony is substantiated and supplemented rather than\r\nrefuted by their very antipodes, the satirists, a group headed by\r\nMartial, Juvenal and the incomparable Petronius, who really is in a\r\nclass by himself.\r\n\r\nThere is one more man worthy of mention in our particular study,\r\nHorace, a true poet, the most objective of all writers,\r\nman-about-town, pet of society, mundane genius, gifted to look calmly\r\ninto the innermost heart of his time. His eyes fastened a correct\r\npicture on the sensitive diaphragm of a good memory, leaving an\r\nimpression neither distorted nor \"out of focus.\" His eye did not \"pick\r\nup,\" for sundry reasons, the defects of the objects of observation,\r\nnor did it work with the uncanny joy of subconscious exaggeration met\r\nwith so frequently in modern writing, nor did he indulge in that\r\npredilection for ugly detail sported by modern art.\r\n\r\nSo much for Horatius, poet. Still, he was not a specialist in our\r\nline. We cannot enroll him among the gifted gourmets no matter how\r\nmany meals he enjoyed at the houses of his society friends. We are\r\nrather inclined to place him among the host of writers, ancient and\r\nmodern, who have treated the subject of food with a sort of sovereign\r\ncontempt, or at least with indifference, because its study presented\r\nunsurmountable difficulties, and the subject, _per se_, was a menial\r\none. With this attitude of our potential chief witnesses defined, we\r\nhave no occasion to further appeal to them here, and we might proceed\r\nto real business, to the sifting of the trustworthy material at hand.\r\nIt is really a relief to know that we have no array of formidable\r\nauthorities to be considered in our study. We have virgin field before\r\nus--i.e., the ruins of ancient greatness grown over by a jungle of two\r\nthousand years of hostile posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOMPEII\r\n\r\nPompeii was destroyed in A.D. 79. From its ruins we have obtained in\r\nthe last half century more information about the intimate domestic and\r\npublic life of the ancients than from any other single source. What is\r\nmore important, this vast wealth of information is first hand,\r\nunspoiled, undiluted, unabridged, unbiased, uncensored;--in short,\r\nuntouched by meddlesome human hands.\r\n\r\nThough only a provincial town, Pompeii was a prosperous mercantile\r\nplace, a representative market-place, a favorite resort for fashionable\r\npeople. The town had hardly recuperated from a preliminary attack by\r\nthat treacherous mountain, Vesuvius, when a second onslaught succeeded\r\nin complete destruction. Suddenly, without warning, this lumbering\r\n_force majeur_ visited the ill-fated towns in its vicinity with\r\nmerciless annihilation. The population, just then enjoying the games in\r\nthe amphitheatre outside of the \"downtown\" district, had had hardly\r\ntime to save their belongings. They escaped with their bare lives. Only\r\nthe aged, the infirm, the prisoners and some faithful dogs were left\r\nbehind. Today their bodies in plaster casts may be seen, mute witnesses\r\nto a frightful disaster. The town was covered with an airtight blanket\r\nof ashes, lava and fine pumice stone. There was no prolonged death\r\nstruggle, no perceivable decay extended over centuries as was the cruel\r\nlot of Pompeii's mistress, Rome. There were no agonies to speak of. The\r\ngreat event was consummated within a few hours. The peace of death\r\nsettled down to reign supreme after the dust had been driven away by\r\nthe gentle breezes coming in from the bay of Naples. Some courageous\r\ncitizens returned, searching in the hot ashes for the crashed-in roofs\r\nof their villas, to recover this or that. Perhaps they hoped to salvage\r\nthe strong box in the atrium, or a heirloom from the triclinium. But\r\nsoon they gave up. Despairing, or hoping for better days to come, they\r\nvanished in the mist of time. Pompeii, the fair, the hospitable, the\r\ngay city, just like any individual out of luck, was and stayed\r\nforgotten. The Pompeians, their joys, sorrows, their work and play,\r\ntheir virtues and vices--everything was arrested with one single\r\nstroke, stopped, even as a camera clicks, taking a snapshot.\r\n\r\nThe city's destruction, it appears, was a formidable opening blow\r\ndealt the Roman empire in the prime of its life, in a war of\r\nextermination waged by hostile invisible forces. Pompeii makes one\r\nbelieve in \"Providence.\" A great disaster actually moulding, casting a\r\nperfect image of the time for future generations! To be exact, it took\r\nthese generations eighteen centuries to discover and to appreciate the\r\nheritage that was theirs, buried at the foot of Vesuvius. During these\r\nlong dark and dusky centuries charming goat herds had rested unctuous\r\nshocks of hair upon mysterious columns that, like young giant\r\nasparagus, stuck their magnificent heads out of the ground. Blinking\r\ndrowsily at yonder villainous mountain, the summit of which is\r\neternally crowned with a halo of thin white smoke, such as we are\r\naccustomed to see arising from the stacks of chemical factories, the\r\nconfident shepherd would lazily implore his patron saint to enjoin\r\nthat unreliable devilish force within lest the _dolce far niente_ of\r\nthe afternoon be disturbed, for siestas are among the most important\r\nfunctions in the life of that region. Occasionally the more\r\nenterprising would arm themselves with pick-axe and shovel, made bold\r\nby whispered stories of fabulous wealth, and, defying the evil spirits\r\nprotecting it, they would set out on an expedition of loot and\r\ndesecration of the tomb of ancient splendor.\r\n\r\nOnly about a century and a half ago the archaeological conscience\r\nawoke. Only seventy-five years ago energetic moves made possible a\r\nfruitful pilgrimage to this shrine of humanity, while today not more\r\nthan two-thirds but perhaps the most important parts of the city have\r\nbeen opened to our astonished eyes by men who know.\r\n\r\nAnd now: we may see that loaf of bread baked nineteen centuries ago,\r\nas found in the bake shop. We may inspect the ingenious bake oven\r\nwhere it was baked. We may see the mills that ground the flour for the\r\nbread, and, indeed find unground wheat kernels. We see the oil still\r\npreserved in the jugs, the residue of wine still in the amphorae, the\r\nfigs preserved in jars, the lentils, the barley, the spices in the\r\ncupboard; everything awaits our pleasure: the taverns with their\r\n\"bars\"; the ancient guests' opinion of Mine Host scribbled on the\r\nwall, the kitchens with their implements, the boudoirs of milady's\r\nwith the cosmetics and perfumes in the compacts. There are the\r\nadvertisements on the walls, the foods praised with all the _eclat_ of\r\nmodern advertising, the election notices, the love missives, the bank\r\ndeposits, the theatre tickets, law records, bills of sale.\r\n\r\nPhantom-like yet real there are the good citizens of a good town,\r\nparading, hustling, loafing--sturdy patricians, wretched plebeians,\r\nstern centurios, boastful soldiers, scheming politicians, crafty\r\nlaw-clerks, timid scribes, chattering barbers, bullying gladiators,\r\nhaughty actors, dusty travelers, making for Albinus', the famous host\r\nat the _Via della Abbondanza_ or, would he give preference to Sarinus,\r\nthe son of Publius, who advertised so cleverly? Or, perhaps, could he\r\nafford to stop at the \"Fortunata\" Hotel, centrally located?\r\n\r\nThere are, too, the boorish hayseeds from out of town trying to sell\r\ntheir produce, unaccustomed to the fashionable Latin-Greek speech of\r\nthe city folks, gaping with their mouths wide open, greedily at the\r\nsteaks of sacrificial meat displayed behind enlarging glasses in the\r\ncheap cook shop windows. There they giggle and chuckle, those wily\r\nlandlords with their blasé habitués and their underlings, the greasy\r\ncooks, the roguish \"good mixers\" at the bar and the winsome if\r\nresolute _copæ_--waitresses--all ready to go, to do business. So\r\nslippery are the cooks that Plautus calls one _Congrio_--sea eel--so\r\nblack that another deserves the title _Anthrax_--coal.\r\n\r\nThere they are, one and all, the characters necessary to make up what\r\nwe call civilization, chattering agitatedly in a lingo of\r\nLatin-Greek-Oscan--as if life were a continuous market day.\r\n\r\nIt takes no particular scholarship, only a little imagination and\r\nhuman sympathy to see and to hear the ghosts of Pompeii.\r\n\r\nThere is no pose about this town, no _mise-en-scène_, no\r\nstage-setting. No heroic gesture. No theatricals, in short, no lies.\r\nThere is to be found no shred of that vainglorious cloak which humans\r\nwill deftly drape about their shoulders whenever they happen to be\r\naware of the camera. There is no \"registering\" of any kind here.\r\n\r\nPompeii's natural and pleasant disposition, therefore, is ever so much\r\nmore in evidence. Not a single one of this charming city's movements\r\nwas intended for posterity. Her life stands before our eyes in clear\r\nreality, in naked, unadorned truth. Indeed, there were many things\r\nthat the good folks would have loved to point to with pride. You have\r\nto search for these now. There are, alas and alack, a few things they\r\nwould have hidden, had they only known what was in store for them. But\r\nall these things, good, indifferent and bad, remained in their places;\r\nand here they are, unsuspecting, real, natural, charming like Diana\r\nand her wood nymphs.\r\n\r\nWere it not quite superfluous, we would urgently recommend the study\r\nof Pompeii to the students of life in general and to those of\r\nAntiquity in particular. Those who would know something about the\r\nancient table cannot do without Pompeii.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE ANCIENT WRITERS: ANACHARSIS, APICIUS, PETRONIUS\r\n\r\nTo those who lay stress upon documentary evidence or literary\r\ntestimony, to those trusting implicitly in the honesty and reliability\r\nof writers of fiction, we would recommend Petronius Arbiter.\r\n\r\nHis _cena Trimalchionis_, Trimalchio's dinner, is the sole surviving\r\npiece from the pen of a Roman contemporary, giving detailed\r\ninformation on our subject. It is, too, the work of a great writer\r\nmoving in the best circles, and, therefore, so much more desirable as\r\nan expert. Petronius deserves to be quoted in full but his work is too\r\nwell-known, and our space too short. However, right here we wish to\r\nwarn the student to bear in mind in perusing Petronius that this\r\nwriter, in his _cena_, is not depicting a meal but that he is\r\nsatirizing a man--that makes all the difference in the world as far\r\nas we are concerned. Petronius' _cena_ is plainly an exaggeration, but\r\neven from its distorted contours the student may recognize the true\r\nlines of an ancient meal.\r\n\r\nThere is, not so well-known a beautiful picture of an Athenian dinner\r\nparty which must not be overlooked, for it contains a wealth of\r\ninformation. Although Greek, we learn from it much of the Roman\r\nconditions. Anacharsis' description of a banquet at Athens, dating\r\nback to the fourth century B.C. about the time when the Periclean\r\nrégime flourished, is worth your perusal. A particularly good version\r\nof this tale is rendered by Baron Vaerst in his book \"Gastrosophie,\"\r\nLeipzig, 1854, who has based his version on the original translation\r\nfrom the Greek, entitled, _Voyage du jeune Anacharsis en Grèce vers le\r\nmilieu du quatrième siècle avant l'ère vulgaire par J. J. Barthélemy_,\r\nParis, 1824. Vaerst has amplified the excerpts from the young\r\ntraveler's observations by quotations from other ancient Greek writers\r\nupon the subject, thus giving us a most beautiful and authentic ideal\r\ndescription of Greek table manners and habits when Athens had reached\r\nthe height in culture, refinement and political greatness.\r\n\r\nAnacharsis was not a Hellene but a Scythian visitor. By his own\r\nadmission he is no authority on Grecian cookery, but as a reporter he\r\nexcels.\r\n\r\nThis truly Hellenic discussion of the art of eating and living at the\r\ntable of the cultured Athenians is the most profound discourse we know\r\nof, ancient or modern, on eating. The wisdom revealed in this tale is\r\nlasting, and, like Greek marble, consummate in external beauty and\r\ninner worth.\r\n\r\nWe thus possess the testimony of two contemporary writers which\r\ntogether with the book of Apicius and with what we learn from\r\nAthenaeus should give a fair picture of ancient eating and cookery.\r\n\r\nApicius is our most substantial witness.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this source has not been spared by meddlesome men, and\r\nit has not reached us in its pristine condition. As a matter of fact,\r\nApicius has been badly mauled throughout the centuries. This book has\r\nalways attracted attention, never has it met with indifference. In the\r\nmiddle ages it became the object of intensive study, interpretation,\r\ncontroversy--in short it has attracted interest that has lasted into\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\nWhen, with the advent of the dark ages, it ceased to be a practical\r\ncookery book, it became a treasure cherished by the few who preserved\r\nthe classical literature, and after the invention of printing it\r\nbecame the object of curiosity, even mystery. Some interpreters waxed\r\nenthusiastic over it, others who failed to understand it, condemned it\r\nas hopeless and worthless.\r\n\r\nThe pages of our Apiciana plainly show the lasting interest in our\r\nancient book, particularly ever since its presence became a matter of\r\ncommon knowledge during the first century of printing.\r\n\r\nThe Apicius book is the most ancient of European cookery books.\r\nHowever, Platina's work, _de honesta uolvptate_, is the first cookery\r\nbook to appear in print. Platina, in 1474, was more up-to-date. His\r\nbook had a larger circulation. But its vogue stopped after a century\r\nwhile Apicius marched on through centuries to come, tantalizing the\r\nscholars, amusing the curious gourmets if not educated cooks to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPICIUS, THE MAN\r\n\r\nWho was Apicius? This is the surname of several renowned gastronomers\r\nof old Rome. There are many references and anecdotes in ancient\r\nliterature to men bearing this name. Two Apicii have definitely been\r\naccounted for. The older one, Marcus A. lived at the time of Sulla\r\nabout 100 B.C. The man we are most interested in, M. Gabius Apicius,\r\nlived under Augustus and Tiberius, 80 B.C. to A.D. 40. However, both\r\nthese men had a reputation for their good table.\r\n\r\n\r\nATHENAEUS ON APICIUS\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the well-read Athenaeus, conversant with most\r\nauthors of Antiquity makes no mention of the Apicius book. This\r\ncollection of recipes, then, was not in general circulation during\r\nAthenaei time (beginning of the third century of our era), that,\r\nmaybe, it was kept a secret by some Roman cooks. On the other hand it\r\nis possible that the Apicius book did not exist during the time of\r\nAthenaeus in the form handed down to us and that the monographs on\r\nvarious departments of cookery (most of them of Greek origin, works of\r\nwhich indeed Athenaeus speaks) were collected after the first quarter\r\nof the third century and were adorned with the name of Apicius merely\r\nbecause his fame as a gourmet had endured.\r\n\r\nWhat Athenaeus knows about Apicius (one of three known famous eaters\r\nbearing that name) is the following:\r\n\r\n    \"About the time of Tiberius [42 B.C.-37 A.D.] there\r\n    lived a man, named Apicius; very rich and luxurious, for\r\n    whom several kinds of cheesecake called Apician, are\r\n    named [not found in our present A.]. He spent myriads of\r\n    drachmas on his belly, living chiefly at Minturnæ, a\r\n    city of Campania, eating very expensive crawfish, which\r\n    are found in that place superior in size to those of\r\n    Smyrna, or even to the crabs of Alexandria. Hearing,\r\n    too, that they were very large in Africa, he sailed\r\n    thither, without waiting a single day, and suffered\r\n    exceedingly on his voyage. But when he came near the\r\n    coast, before he disembarked (for his arrival made a\r\n    great stir among the Africans) the fishermen came\r\n    alongside in their boats and brought him some very fine\r\n    crawfish; and he, when he saw them, asked if they had\r\n    any finer; and when they said that there were none finer\r\n    than those which they had brought, he, recollecting\r\n    those at Minturnæ ordered the master of the ship to sail\r\n    back the same way into Italy, without going near the\r\n    land....\r\n\r\n    \"When the emperor Trajan [A.D. 52 or 53-117] was in\r\n    Parthia [a country in Asia, part of Persia?] at a\r\n    distance of many days from the sea, Apicius sent him\r\n    fresh oysters, which he had kept so by a clever\r\n    contrivance of his own; real oysters....\"\r\n\r\n(The instructions given in our Apicius book, Recipe 14, for the\r\nkeeping of oysters would hardly guarantee their safe arrival on such\r\na journey as described above.)\r\n\r\nAthenaeus tells us further that many of the Apician recipes were\r\nfamous and that many dishes were named after him. This confirms the\r\ntheory that Apicius was not the author of the present book but that\r\nthe book was dedicated to him by an unknown author or compiler.\r\nAthenaeus also mentions one Apion who wrote a book on luxurious\r\nliving. Whether this man is identical with the author or patron of our\r\nbook is problematic. Torinus, in his _epistola dedicatoria_ to the\r\n1541 edition expresses the same doubt.\r\n\r\nMarcus Gabius (or Gavius) Apicius lived during Rome's most interesting\r\nepoch, when the empire had reached its highest point, when the seeds\r\nof decline, not yet apparent, were in the ground, when in the quiet\r\nvillages of that far-off province, Palestine, the Saviour's doctrines\r\nfascinated humble audiences--teachings that later reaching the very\r\nheart of the world's mistress were destined to tarnish the splendor of\r\nthat autocrat.\r\n\r\nAccording to the mention by various writers, this man, M. Gabius\r\nApicius, was one of the many ancient gastronomers who took the subject\r\nof food seriously. Assuming a scientific attitude towards eating and\r\nfood they were criticised for paying too much attention to their\r\ntable. This was considered a superfluous and indeed wicked luxury when\r\nfrugality was a virtue. These men who knew by intuition the importance\r\nof knowing something about nutrition are only now being vindicated by\r\nthe findings of modern science.\r\n\r\nM. Gabius Apicius, this most famous of the celebrated and much\r\nmaligned bon-vivants, quite naturally took great interest in the\r\npreparation of food. He is said to have originated many dishes\r\nhimself; he collected much material on the subject and he endowed a\r\nschool for the teaching of cookery and for the promotion of culinary\r\nideas. This very statement by his critics places him high in our\r\nesteem, as it shows him up as a scientist and educator. He spent his\r\nvast fortune for food, as the stories go, and when he had only a\r\nquarter million dollars left (a paltry sum today but a considerable\r\none in those days when gold was scarce and monetary standards in a\r\nworse muddle than today) Apicius took his own life, fearing that he\r\nmight have to starve to death some day.\r\n\r\nThis story seems absurd on the face of it, yet Seneca and Martial tell\r\nit (both with different tendencies) and Suidas, Albino and other\r\nwriters repeat it without critical analysis. These writers who are\r\nunreliable in culinary matters anyway, claim that Apicius spent one\r\nhundred million _sestertii_ on his appetite--_in gulam_. Finally when\r\nthe hour of accounting came he found that there were only ten million\r\n_sestertii_ left, so he concluded that life was not worth living if\r\nhis gastronomic ideas could no longer be carried out in the accustomed\r\nand approved style, and he took poison at a banquet especially\r\narranged for the occasion.\r\n\r\nIn the light of modern experience with psychology, with economics,\r\ndepressions, journalism, we focus on this and similar stories, and we\r\nfind them thoroughly unreliable. We cannot believe this one. It is too\r\nmelodramatic, too moralistic perhaps to suit our modern taste. The\r\nunderlying causes for the conduct, life and end of Apicius have not\r\nbeen told. Of course, we have to accept the facts as reported. If only\r\na Petronius had written that story! What a story it might have been!\r\nBut there is only one Petronius in antiquity. His Trimalchio, former\r\nslave, successful profiteer and food speculator, braggard and\r\ndrunkard, wife-beater--an upstart who arranged extravagant banquets\r\nmerely to show off, who, by the way, also arranged for his funeral at\r\nhis banquet (Apician fashion and, indeed, Petronian fashion! for\r\nPetronius died in the same manner) and who peacefully \"passed out\"\r\nsoundly intoxicated--this man is a figure true to life as it was then,\r\nas it is now and as it probably will continue to be. Last but not\r\nleast: Mrs. Trimalchio, the resolute lady who helped him \"make his\r\npile\"--these are human characters much more real, much more\r\ntrustworthy than anything and everything else ever depicted by any\r\nancient pen; they bring out so graphically the modernity of antiquity.\r\nWithout Petronius and Pompeii the antique world would forever remain\r\nat an inexplicably remote distance to our modern conception of life.\r\nWith him, and with the dead city, the riddles of antiquity are cleared\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOOK\r\n\r\nMany dishes listed in Apicius are named for various celebrities who\r\nflourished at a later date than the second Apicius. It is noteworthy,\r\nhowever, that neither such close contemporaries as Heliogabalus and\r\nNero, notorious gluttons, nor Petronius, the arbiter of fashion of the\r\nperiod, are among the persons thus honored. Vitellius, a later\r\nglutton, is well represented in the book. It is fair to assume, then,\r\nthat the author or collector of our present Apicius lived long after\r\nthe second Apicius, or, at least, that the book was augmented by\r\npersons posterior to M. Gabius A. The book in its present state was\r\nprobably completed about the latter part of the third century. It is\r\nalmost certain that many recipes were added to a much earlier edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBABLY OF GREEK PARENTAGE\r\n\r\nWe may as well add another to the many speculations by saying that it\r\nis quite probable for our book to originate in a number of Greek\r\nmanuals or monographs on specialized subjects or departments of\r\ncookery. Such special treatises are mentioned by Athenaeus (cf.\r\nHumelbergius, quoted by Lister). The titles of each chapter (or book)\r\nare in Greek, the text is full of Greek terminology. While\r\nclassification under the respective titles is not strictly adhered to\r\nat all times, it is significant that certain subjects, that of fish\r\ncookery, for instance, appear twice in the book, the same subject\r\nshowing treatment by widely different hands. Still more significant is\r\nthe absence in our book of such important departments as\r\ndesserts--_dulcia_--confections in which the ancients were experts.\r\nBakery, too, even the plainest kind, is conspicuously absent in the\r\nApician books. The latter two trades being particularly well\r\ndeveloped, were departmentalized to an astonishing degree in ancient\r\nGreece and Rome. These indispensable books are simply wanting in our\r\nbook if it be but a collection of Greek monographs. Roman culture and\r\nrefinement of living, commencing about 200-250 years before our era\r\nwas under the complete rule of Hellas. Greek influence included\r\neverybody from philosophers, artists, architects, actors, law-makers\r\nto cooks.\r\n\r\n\"The conquered thus conquered the conquerors.\"\r\n\r\nHumelbergius makes a significant reference to the origin of Apicius.\r\nWe confess, we have not checked up this worthy editor nor his\r\nsuccessor, Dr. Lister, whom he quotes in the preface as to the origin\r\nof our book. With reference to Plato's work, Humelbergius says:\r\n\r\n    \"_Que res tota spectat medicinæ partem, quæ diaitetike\r\n    appelatur, et victu medetur: at in hac tes diaitetikes\r\n    parte totus est Apicius noster._\"\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, unfounded of course by positive proof, the Apicius\r\nbook is somewhat of a gastronomic bible, consisting of ten different\r\nbooks by several authors, originating in Greece and taken over by the\r\nRomans along with the rest of Greek culture as spoils of war. These\r\nbooks, or chapters, or fragments thereof, must have been in vogue long\r\nbefore they were collected and assembled in the present form.\r\nEditions, or copies of the same must have been numerous, either singly\r\nor collectively, at the beginning of our era. As a matter of fact, the\r\nExcerpts by Vinidarius, found in the _codex Salmasianus_ prove this\r\ntheory and give rise to the assumption that the Apicius book was a\r\nstandard work for cookery that existed at one time or other in a far\r\nmore copious volume and that the present Apicius is but a fragment of\r\na formerly vaster and more complete collection of culinary and medical\r\nformulæ.\r\n\r\nThus a fragmentary Apicius has been handed down to us in manuscript\r\nform through the centuries, through the revolutionary era of Christian\r\nascendancy, through the dark ages down to the Renaissance. Unknown\r\nagencies, mostly medical and monastic, stout custodians of antique\r\nlearning, reverent lovers of good cheer have preserved it for us until\r\nprinting made possible the book's wide distribution among the\r\nscholars. Just prior to Gutenberg's epoch-making printing press there\r\nwas a spurt of interest in our book in Italy, as attested to by a\r\ndozen of manuscripts, copied in the fourteenth and the fifteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nApicius may justly be called the world's oldest cookery book; the very\r\nold Sanscrit book, Vasavarayeyam, unknown to us except by name, is\r\nsaid to be a tract on vegetarian cookery.\r\n\r\nThe men who have preserved this work for future generations, who have\r\nmade it accessible to the public (as was Lister's intention) have\r\nperformed a service to civilization that is not to be underestimated.\r\nThey have done better than the average archaeologist with one or\r\nanother find to his credit. The Apicius book is a living thing,\r\ncapable of creating happiness. Some gastronomic writers have pointed\r\nout that the man who discovers a new dish does more for humanity than\r\nthe man who discovers a new star, because the discovery of a new dish\r\naffects the happiness of mankind more pleasantly than the addition of\r\na new planet to an already overcrowded chart of the universe. Viewing\r\nApicius from such a materialistic point of view he should become very\r\npopular in this age of ours so keen for utilities of every sort.\r\n\r\n\r\nC{OE}LIUS-CÆLIUS\r\n\r\nThe name of another personality is introduced in connection with the\r\nbook, namely that of C{oe}lius or Cælius. This name is mentioned in\r\nthe title of the first undated edition (ca. 1483-6) as Celius.\r\nTorinus, 1541, places \"Cælius\" before \"Apicius\"; Humelbergius, 1542,\r\nplaces \"C{oe}lius\" after A. Lister approves of this, berating Torinus\r\nfor his willful methods of editing the book: \"_En hominem in\r\nconjecturis sane audacissimus!_\" If any of them were correct about\r\n\"C{oe}lius,\" Torinus would be the man. (Cf. Schanz, Röm. Lit. Gesch.,\r\nMüller's Handbuch d. klass. Altertums-Wissenschaft, V III, 112, p.\r\n506.) However, there is no _raison d'être_ for C{oe}lius.\r\n\r\nHis presence and the unreality thereof has been cleared up by Vollmer,\r\nas will be duly shown. The squabble of the medieval savants has also\r\ngiven rise to the story that Apicius is but a joke perpetrated upon\r\nthe world by a medieval savant. This will be refuted also later on.\r\nOur book is a genuine Roman. Medieval savants have made plenty of\r\nRoman \"fakes,\" for sundry reasons. A most ingenious hoax was the\r\n\"completion\" of the Petronius fragment by a scholar able to hoodwink\r\nhis learned contemporaries by an exhibition of Petronian literary\r\nstyle and a fertile imagination. Ever so many other \"fakers\" were\r\nshown up in due time. When this version of Petronius was pronounced\r\ngenuine by the scientific world, the perpetrator of the \"joke\"\r\nconfessed, enjoying a good laugh at the expense of his colleagues. But\r\nwe shall presently understand how such a \"joke\" with Apicius would be\r\nimpossible. Meanwhile, we crave the indulgence of the modern reader\r\nwith our mention of C{oe}lius. We desire to do full justice to the\r\nancient work and complete the presentation of its history. The\r\ncontroversies that have raged over it make this course necessary.\r\n\r\nOur predecessors have not had the benefit of modern communication,\r\nand, therefore, could not know all that is to be known on the subject.\r\nWe sympathize with Lister yet do not condemn Torinus. If Torinus ever\r\ndared making important changes in the old text, they are easily\r\nascertained by collation with other texts. This we have endeavored to\r\ndo. Explaining the discrepancies, it will be noted that we have not\r\ngiven a full vote of confidence to Lister.\r\n\r\nWhy should the mysterious C{oe}lius or Cælius, if such an author or\r\ncompiler of a tome on cookery existed affix the name of \"Apicius\" to\r\nit? The reason would be commercial gain, prestige accruing from the\r\nname of that cookery celebrity. Such business sense would not be\r\nextraordinary. Modern cooks pursue the same method. Witness the\r\ninnumerable à la soandsos. Babies, apartment houses, streets, cities,\r\nparks, dogs, race horses, soap, cheese, herring, cigars, hair\r\nrestorers are thus named today. \"Apicius\" on the front page of any\r\nancient cookery book would be perfectly consistent with the ancient\r\nspirit of advertising. It has been stated, too, that C{oe}lius had\r\nmore than one collaborator. Neither can this be proven.\r\n\r\nThe copyists have made many changes throughout the original text.\r\nMisspelling of terms, ignorance of cookery have done much to obscure\r\nthe meaning. The scribes of the middle ages had much difficulty in\r\nthis respect since medieval Latin is different from Apician language.\r\n\r\nThe very language of the original is proof for its authenticity. The\r\ndesire of Torinus to interpret to his medieval readers the ancient\r\ntext is pardonable. How much or how little he succeeded is attested to\r\nby some of his contemporary readers, former owners of our copies.\r\nScholars plainly confess inability to decipher Apicius by groans\r\ninscribed on the fly leaves and title pages in Latin, French and other\r\nlanguages. One French scholar of the 16th century, apparently \"kidded\"\r\nfor studying an undecipherable cook book, stoically inscribes the\r\ntitle page of our Lyon, 1541, copy with: \"This amuses me. Why make fun\r\nof me?\" This sort of message, reaching us out of the dim past of\r\nbygone centuries is among the most touching reading we have done, and\r\nhas urged us on with the good though laborious and unprofitable work.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its drawbacks, our book is a classic both as to form\r\nand contents. It has served as a prototype of most ancient and modern\r\nbooks. Its influence is felt to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe book has often been cited by old writers as proof of the\r\ndebaucheries and the gluttony of ancient Rome. Nothing could be\r\nfurther from the truth because these writers failed to understand the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nThe Apicius book reflects the true condition (partly so, because it is\r\nincomplete) of the kitchen prevailing at the beginning of our era when\r\nthe mistress of the Old World was in her full regalia, when her ample\r\nbody had not yet succumbed to that fatty degeneration of the interior\r\nso fatal to ever so many individuals, families, cities and nations.\r\n\r\nWe repeat, our Apicius covers Rome's healthy epoch; hence the\r\nimportance of the book. The voluptuous concoctions, the fabulous\r\ndishes, the proverbial excesses that have made decent people shudder\r\nwith disgust throughout the ages are not known to Apicius. If they\r\never existed at all in their traditional ugliness they made their\r\nappearance after Apicius' time. We recall, Petronius, describing some\r\nof these \"stunts\" is a contemporary of Nero (whom he satirizes as\r\n\"Trimalchio\"). So is Seneca, noble soul, another victim of Cæsarean\r\ninsanity; he, too, describes Imperial excesses. These extremely few\r\nfoolish creations are really at the bottom of the cause for this\r\nmisunderstanding of true Roman life. Such stupidity has allowed the\r\njoy of life which, as Epikuros and Platina believe, may be indulged in\r\nwith perfect virtue and honesty to become a byword among all good\r\npeople who are not gastronomers either by birth, by choice or by\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nWith due justice to the Roman people may we be permitted to say that\r\nproverbial excesses were exceedingly rare occurrences. The follies and\r\nthe vices of a Nero, a boy Heliogabalus, a Pollio, a Vitellius and a\r\nfew other notorious wasters are spread sporadically over a period of\r\nat least eight hundred years. Between these cases of gastronomic\r\ninsanity lie wellnigh a thousand years of everyday grind and drudgery\r\nof the Roman people. The bulk was miserably fed as compared with\r\nmodern standards of living. Only a few patricians could afford \"high\r\nliving.\" Since a prosperous bourgeoisie (usually the economic and\r\ngastronomic background of any nation) was practically unknown in Rome,\r\nwhere the so-called middle classes were in reality poor, shiftless and\r\nfloating freedmen, it is evident that the bulk of the population\r\nbecause of the empire's unsettled economic conditions, its extensive\r\nsystem of slavery (precluding all successful practice of trades by\r\nfreemen), the continuous military operations, the haphazard financial\r\nsystem, was forced to live niggardly. The contrast between the middle\r\nclasses and the upper classes seemed very cruel. This condition may\r\naccount for the many outcries against the \"extravagances\" of the few\r\nprivileged ones who could afford decent food and for the exaggerated\r\nstories about their table found in the literature of the time.\r\n\r\nThe seemingly outlandish methods of Apician food preparation become\r\nplain and clear in the light of social evolution. \"Evolution\" is\r\nperhaps not the right word to convey our idea of social perpetual\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nApicius used practically all the cooking utensils in use today. He\r\nonly lacked gas, electricity and artificial refrigeration, modern\r\nachievements while useful in the kitchen and indispensable in\r\nwholesale production and for labor saving, that have no bearing on\r\npurely gastronomical problems. There is only one difference between\r\nthe cooking utensils of yore and the modern products: the old ones are\r\nhand-made, more individualistic, more beautiful, more artistic than\r\nour machine-made varieties.\r\n\r\nDespite his strangeness and remoteness, Apicius is not dead by any\r\nmeans. We have but to inspect (as Gollmer has pointed out) the table\r\nof the Southern Europeans to find Apician traditions alive. In the\r\nNorthern countries, too, are found his traces. To think that Apicius\r\nshould have survived in the North of Europe, far removed from his\r\nnative soil, is a rather audacious suggestion. But the keen observer\r\ncan find him in Great Britain, Scandinavia and the Baltic provinces\r\ntoday. The conquerors and seafarers coming from the South have carried\r\nthe pollen of gastronomic flowers far into the North where they\r\nadjusted themselves to soil and climate. Many a cook of the British\r\nisles, of Southern Sweden, Holstein, Denmark, Friesland, Pomerania\r\nstill observes Apicius rules though he may not be aware of the fact.\r\n\r\nWe must realize that Apicius is only a book, a frail hand-made record\r\nand that, while the record itself might have been forgotten, its\r\nprinciples have become international property, long ago. Thus they\r\nlive on. Like a living thing--a language, a custom, they themselves\r\nmay have undergone changes, \"improvements,\" alterations, augmentation,\r\ncorruption. But the character has been preserved; a couple of thousand\r\nyears are, after all, but a paltry matter. Our own age is but the\r\ngrandchild of antiquity. The words we utter, in their roots, are those\r\nof our grandfathers. And so do many dishes we eat today resemble those\r\nonce enjoyed by Apicius and his friends.\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to point the tenacity of the spirit of the Antique,\r\nreaching deep into the modern age? The latest Apicius edition in the\r\noriginal Latin is dated 1922!\r\n\r\nThe gastronomic life of Europe was under the complete rule of old Rome\r\nuntil the middle of the seventeenth century. Then came a sudden change\r\nfor modernity, comparable to the rather abrupt change of languages\r\nfrom the fashionable Latin to the national idioms and vernacular, in\r\nEngland and Germany under the influence of literary giants like\r\nLuther, Chaucer, Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nAll medieval food literature of the continent and indeed the early\r\ncookery books of England prior to La Varenne (Le Cuisinier François,\r\n1654) are deeply influenced by Apicius. The great change in eating,\r\nresulting in a new gastronomic order, attained its highest peak of\r\nperfection just prior to the French revolution. Temporarily suspended\r\nby this social upheaval, it continued to flourish until about the\r\nlatter part of last century. The last decades of this new order is\r\noften referred to as the classical period of gastronomy, with France\r\nclaiming the laurels for its development. \"Classic\" for reasons we do\r\nnot know (Urbain Dubois, outstanding master of this period wrote \"La\r\nCuisine classique\") except that its precepts appeal as classical to\r\nour notion of eating. This may not correspond to the views of\r\nposterity, we had therefore better wait a century or two before\r\nproclaiming our system of cookery \"classical.\"\r\n\r\nDisposing of that old \"classic,\" Apicius, as slowly as a conservative\r\ncooking world could afford to do, the present nations set out to\r\ncultivate a taste for things that a Roman would have pronounced unfit\r\nfor a slave. Still, the world moves on. Conquest, discovery of foreign\r\nparts, the New World, contributed fine things to the modern\r\ntable,--old forgotten foods were rediscovered--endless lists of\r\nmaterials and combinations, new daring, preposterous dishes that made\r\nthe younger generation rejoice while old folks looked on gasping with\r\ndismay, despair, contempt.\r\n\r\nBe it sufficient to remark that the older practitioners of our own\r\ndays, educated in \"classic\" cuisine again are quite apprehensive of\r\ntheir traditions endangered by the spirit of revolt of the young\r\nagainst the old. Again and again we hear of a decline that has set in,\r\nand even by the best authorities alarmist notes are spread to the\r\neffect that \"we have begun our journey back, step by step to our\r\nprimitive tree and our primitive nuts\" (Pennell. Does Spengler\r\nconsider food in his \"Decline of the West?\").\r\n\r\nIt matters not whether we share this pessimism, nor what we may have\r\nto say _pro_ or _con_ this question of \"progress\" or \"retrogression\"\r\nin eating (or in anything else for that matter). In fact we are not\r\nconcerned with the question here more than to give it passing\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIf \"classic\" cookery is dying nowadays, if it cannot reassert itself\r\nthat would be a loss to mankind. But this classic cookery system has\r\nso far only been the sole and exclusive privilege of a dying\r\naristocracy. It seems quite in order that it should go under in the\r\ngreat _Götterdämmerung_ that commenced with the German peasants wars\r\nof the sixteenth century, flaring up (as the second act) in the French\r\nrevolution late in the eighteenth century, the Act III of which drama\r\nhas been experienced in our own days.\r\n\r\nThe common people as yet have never had an active part in the\r\nenjoyment of the classic art of eating. So far, they always provided\r\nthe wherewithal, and looked on, holding the bag. Modern hotels,\r\nbecause of their commercial character, have done little to perpetuate\r\nit. They merely have commercialized the art. Beyond exercising\r\nordinary salesmanship, our _maîtres d'hôtel_ have not educated our\r\n_nouveaux riches_ in the mysteries and delights of gastronomy.\r\nHotelmen are not supposed to be educators, they merely cater to a\r\ndemand. And our new aristocracy has been too busy with limousines,\r\ngolf, divorces and electricity to bemourn the decline of classic\r\ncookery.\r\n\r\nMost people \"get by\" without the benefit of classic cookery,\r\nsubsisting on a medley of edibles, tenaciously clinging to mother's\r\ntraditions, to things \"as she used to make them,\" and mother's methods\r\nstill savor of Apicius. Surely, this is no sign of retrogression but\r\nof tenacity.\r\n\r\nThe only fundamental difference between Roman dining and that of our\r\nown times may be found in these two indisputable facts--\r\n\r\n(First) Devoid of the science of agriculture, without any advanced\r\nmechanical means, food was not raised in a very systematic way; if it\r\nhappened to be abundant, Roma lacked storage and transportation\r\nfacilities to make good use of it. There never were any food supplies\r\non any large, extensive and scientific scale, hence raw materials, the\r\nwherewithal of a \"classic\" meal, were expensive.\r\n\r\n(Second) Skilled labor, so vital for the success of any good dinner,\r\nso imperative for the rational preparation of food was cheap to those\r\nwho held slaves.\r\n\r\nHence, the culinary conditions of ancient Rome were exactly the\r\nopposite of today's state of affairs. Then, good food was expensive\r\nwhile good labor was cheap. Now, good food is cheap while skilled\r\nlabor is at a premium. Somehow, good, intelligent \"labor\" is reluctant\r\nto devote itself to food. That is another story. The chances for a\r\ngood dinner seemed to be in favor of the Romans--but only for a\r\nfavored few. Those of us, although unable to command a staff of\r\nexperts, but able to prepare their own meals rationally and serve them\r\nwell are indeed fortunate. With a few dimes they may dine in royal\r\nfashion. If our much maligned age has achieved anything at all it has\r\nat least enabled the working \"slave\" of the \"masses\" to dine in a\r\nmanner that even princes could hardly match in former days, a manner\r\nindeed that the princes of our own time could not improve upon. The\r\nfly in the ointment is that most modern people do not know how to\r\nhandle and to appreciate food. This condition, however, may be\r\nremedied by instruction and education.\r\n\r\nSlowly, the modern masses are learning to emulate their erstwhile\r\nmasters in the art of eating. They have the advantages of the great\r\nimprovements in provisioning as compared with former days, thanks\r\nchiefly to the great lines of communication established by modern\r\ncommerce, thanks to scientific agriculture and to the spirit of\r\ncommercial enterprise and its resulting prosperity.\r\n\r\nThere are two \"Ifs\" in the path to humanity's salvation, at least,\r\nthat of its table. If the commercialization of cookery, i.e., the\r\nwholesale production of ready-made foods for the table does not\r\ncompletely enthrall the housewife and if we can succeed to educate the\r\nmasses to make rational, craftsmanlike use of our wonderful stores of\r\nedibles, employing or modifying to this end the rules of classic\r\ncookery, there really should be no need for any serious talk about our\r\njourney back to the primitive nuts. Even Spengler might be wrong then.\r\nAdequate distribution of our foods and rational use thereof seem to be\r\none of the greatest problems today.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHENTICITY OF APICIUS\r\n\r\nAge-old mysteries surrounding our book have not yet been cleared up.\r\nMedieval savants have squabbled in vain. Mrs. Pennell's worries and\r\nthe fears of the learned Englishmen that Apicius might be a hoax have\r\nproven groundless. Still, the mystery of this remarkable book is as\r\nperplexing as ever. The authorship will perhaps never be established.\r\nBut let us forever dispel any doubt about its authenticity.\r\n\r\nModern writers have never doubted the genuineness. To name but a few\r\nwho believe in Apicius: Thudichum, Vollmer, Brandt, Vicaire, Rumohr,\r\nSchuch, Habs, Gollmer.\r\n\r\nWhat matters the identity of the author? Who wrote the Iliad, the\r\nOdyssey, the Nibelungen-Lied? Let us be thankful for possessing them!\r\n\r\nApicius is a genuine document of Roman imperial days. There can be no\r\ndoubt of that!\r\n\r\nThe unquestionable age of the earliest known manuscripts alone\r\nsuffices to prove this.\r\n\r\nThe philologist gives his testimony, too. A medieval scholar could\r\nnever have manufactured Apicius, imitating his strikingly original\r\nterminology. \"Faking\" a technical treatise requires an intimate\r\nknowledge of technical terms and familiarity with the ramifications of\r\nan intricate trade. We recommend a comparison of Platina's text with\r\nApicius: the difference of ancient and medieval Latin is convincing.\r\nStriking examples of this kind have been especially noted in our\r\ndictionary of technical terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATIN SLANG\r\n\r\nH. C. Coote, in his commentary on Apicius (cit. Apiciana) in speaking\r\nof pan gravy, remarks:\r\n\r\n    \"Apicius calls this by the singular phrase of _jus de\r\n    suo sibi_! and sometimes though far less frequently,\r\n    _succus suus_. This phrase is curious enough in itself\r\n    to deserve illustration. It is true old fashioned\r\n    Plautian Latinity, and if other proof were wanting would\r\n    of itself demonstrate the genuineness of the Apician\r\n    text.\"\r\n\r\nThis scholar goes on quoting from Plautus, _Captivi_, Act I, sc. 2,\r\nvv. 12, 13; _Amphitruo_, Act I, sc. q.v. 116 and _ibid._ v. 174; and\r\nfrom _Asinaria_, Act IV, sc. 2, vv. 16 and 17 to prove this, and he\r\nfurther says:\r\n\r\n    \"The phrase is a rare remnant of the old familiar\r\n    language of Rome, such as slaves talked so long, that\r\n    their masters ultimately adopted it--a language of which\r\n    Plautus gives us glimpses and which the _graffiti_ may\r\n    perhaps help to restore. When Varius was emperor, this\r\n    phrase of the kitchen was as rife as when Plautus\r\n    wrote--a proof that occasionally slang has been long\r\n    lived.\"\r\n\r\nCoote is a very able commentator. He has translated in the article\r\nquoted a number of Apician formulæ; and betrays an unusual culinary\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN RESEARCH\r\n\r\nModern means of communication and photography have enabled scientists\r\nin widely different parts to study our book from all angles, to\r\nscrutinize the earliest records, the Vatican and the New York\r\nmanuscripts and the codex Salmasianus in Paris.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Vollmer, of Munich, in his _Studien_ (cit. Apiciana) has\r\ntreated the manuscripts exhaustively, carrying to completion the\r\nresearch begun by Schuch, Traube, Ihm, Studemund, Giarratano and\r\nothers with Brandt, his pupil, carrying on the work of Vollmer. More\r\nmodern scientists deeply interested in the origin of our book! None\r\ndoubting its genuineness.\r\n\r\nVollmer is of the opinion that there reposed in the monastery of\r\nFulda, Germany, an _Archetypus_ which in the ninth century was copied\r\ntwice: once in a Turonian hand--the manuscript now kept in the\r\nVatican--the other copy written partly in insular, partly in\r\nCarolingian minuscle--the Cheltenham _codex_, now in New York. The\r\ncommon source at Fulda of these two manuscripts has been established\r\nby Traube. There is another testimony pointing to Fulda as the oldest\r\nknown source. Pope Nicholas V commissioned Enoche of Ascoli to acquire\r\nold manuscripts in Germany. Enoche used as a guide a list of works\r\nbased upon observations by Poggio in Germany in 1417, listing the\r\nApicius of Fulda. Enoche acquired the Fulda Apicius. He died in\r\nOctober or November, 1457. On December 10th of that year, so we know,\r\nGiovanni de'Medici requested Stefano de'Nardini, Governor of Ancona,\r\nto procure for him from Enoche's estate either in copy or in the\r\noriginal the book, entitled, _Appicius de re quoquinaria_ (cf. No. 3,\r\nApiciana). It is interesting to note that one of the Milanese editions\r\nof 1498 bears a title in this particular spelling. Enoche during his\r\nlife time had lent the book to Giovanni Aurispa.\r\n\r\nIt stands to reason that Poggio, in 1417, viewed at Fulda the\r\n_Archetypus_ of our Apicius, father of the Vatican and the New York\r\nmanuscripts, then already mutilated and wanting books IX and X. Six\r\nhundred years before the arrival of Poggio the Fulda book was no\r\nlonger complete. Already in the ninth century its title page had been\r\ndamaged which is proven by the title page of the Vatican copy which\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n     ___\r\n    INCP\r\n    API\r\n    CÆ\r\n\r\nThat's all! The New York copy, it has been noted, has no title page.\r\nThis book commences in the middle of the list of chapters; the first\r\npart of them and the title page are gone. We recall that the New York\r\nmanuscript was originally bound up with another manuscript, also in\r\nthe Phillipps library at Cheltenham. The missing page or pages were\r\nprobably lost in separating the two manuscripts. It is possible that\r\nEnoche carried with him to Italy one of the ancient copies, very\r\nlikely the present New York copy, then already without a title. At any\r\nrate, not more than twenty-five years after his book hunting\r\nexpedition we find both copies in Italy. It is strange, furthermore,\r\nthat neither of these two ancient copies were used by the fifteenth\r\ncentury copyists to make the various copies distributed by them, but\r\nthat an inferior copy of the Vatican Ms. became the _vulgata_--the\r\nprogenitor of this series of medieval copies. One must bear in mind\r\nhow assiduously medieval scribes copied everything that appeared to be\r\nof any importance to them, and how each new copy by virtue of human\r\nfallibility or self-sufficiency must have suffered in the making, and\r\nit is only by very careful comparison of the various manuscripts that\r\nthe original text may be rehabilitated.\r\n\r\nThis, to a large extent, Vollmer and Giarratano have accomplished.\r\nVollmer, too, rejects the idea invented by the humanists, that Apicius\r\nhad a collaborator, editor or commentator in the person of C{oe}lius\r\nor Cælius. This name, so Vollmer claims, has been added to the book by\r\nmedieval scholars without any reason except conjecture for such\r\naction. They have been misled by the mutilated title: Api... Cæ...;\r\nVollmer reconstructs this title as follows:\r\n\r\n    API[cii artis magiri- (or) opsartyti-]\r\n    CÆ[libri X]\r\n\r\nRemember, it is the title page only that is thus mutilated. The ten\r\nbooks or chapters bear the full name of Apicius, never at any time\r\ndoes the name of C{oe}lius appear in the text, or at the head of the\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nThe _Archetypus_, with the book and the chapters carefully indexed and\r\nnumbered as they were, with each article neatly titled, the captions\r\nand capital letters rubricated--heightened by red color, and with its\r\nproper spacing of the articles and chapters must once have been a\r\nrepresentative example of the art of book making as it flourished\r\ntowards the end of the period that sealed the fate of the Roman\r\nempire, when books of a technical nature, law books, almanacs, army\r\nlists had been developed to a high point of perfection. Luxurious\r\nfinish, elaborate illumination point to the fact that our book (the\r\nVatican copy) was intended for the use in some aristocratic household.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXCERPTS OF VINIDARIUS\r\n\r\nAnd now, from a source totally different than the two important\r\nmanuscripts so much discussed here, we receive additional proof of the\r\nauthenticity of Apicius. In the _codex Salmasianus_ (cf. III,\r\nApiciana) we find some thirty formulæ attributed to Apicius, entitled:\r\n_Apici excerpta a Vinidario vir. inl._ They have been accepted as\r\ngenuine by Salmasius and other early scholars. Schuch incorporated the\r\n_excerpta_ with his Apicius, placing the formulæ in what he believed\r\nto be the proper order. This course, for obvious reasons, is not to be\r\nrecommended. To be sure, the _excerpta_ are Apician enough in\r\ncharacter, though only a few correspond to, or are actual duplicates\r\nof, the Apician precepts. They are additions to the stock of authentic\r\nApician recipes. As such, they may not be included but be appended to\r\nthe traditional text. The _excerpta_ encourage the belief that at the\r\ntime of Vinidarius (got. Vinithaharjis) about the fifth century there\r\nmust have been in circulation an Apicius (collection of recipes) much\r\nmore complete than the one handed down to us through Fulda. It is\r\nfurthermore interesting to note that the _excerpta_, too, are silent\r\nabout C{oe}lius.\r\n\r\nWe may safely join Vollmer in his belief that M. Gabius Apicius,\r\ncelebrated gourmet living during the reign of Tiberius was the real\r\nauthor, or collector, or sponsor of this collection of recipes, or at\r\nleast of the major part thereof--the formulæ bearing the names of\r\nposterior gourmets having been added from time to time. This theory\r\nalso applies to the two instances where the name of Varro is mentioned\r\nin connection with the preparation of beets and onions (bulbs). It is\r\nhardly possible that the author of the book made these references to\r\nVarro. It is more probable that some well-versed posterior reader,\r\nperusing the said articles, added to his copy: \"And Varro prepared\r\nbeets this way, and onions that way....\" (cf. Book III, [70]) Still,\r\nthere is no certainty in this theory either. There were many persons\r\nby the names of Commodus, Trajanus, Frontinianus, such as are\r\nappearing in our text, who were contemporaries of Apicius.\r\n\r\nWith our mind at ease as regards the genuineness of our book we now\r\nmay view it at a closer range.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSCURE TERMINOLOGY\r\n\r\nApicius contains technical terms that have been the subject of much\r\nspeculation and discussion. _Liquamen_, _laser_, _muria_, _garum_,\r\netc., belong to these. They will be found in our little dictionary.\r\nBut we cannot refrain from discussing some at present to make\r\nintelligible the most essential part of the ancient text.\r\n\r\nTake _liquamen_ for instance. It may stand for broth, sauce, stock,\r\ngravy, drippings, even for _court bouillon_--in fact for any liquid\r\nappertaining to or derived from a certain dish or food material. Now,\r\nif Apicius prescribes _liquamen_ for the preparation of a meat or a\r\nvegetable, it is by no means clear to the uninitiated what he has in\r\nmind. In fact, in each case the term _liquamen_ is subject to the\r\ninterpretation of the experienced practitioner. Others than he would\r\nat once be confronted with an unsurmountable difficulty. Scientists\r\nmay not agree with us, but such is kitchen practice. Hence the many\r\nfruitless controversies at the expense of the original, at the\r\ndisappointment of science.\r\n\r\n_Garum_ is another word, one upon which much contemptuous witticism\r\nand serious energy has been spent. _Garum_ simply is a generic name\r\nfor fish essences. True, _garus_ is a certain and a distinct kind of\r\nMediterranean fish, originally used in the manufacture of _garum_; but\r\nthis product, in the course of time, has been altered, modified,\r\nadulterated,--in short, has been changed and the term has naturally\r\nbeen applied to all varieties and variations of fish essences, without\r\ndistinction, and it has thus become a collective term, covering all\r\nvarieties of fish sauces. Indeed, the corruption and degeneration of\r\nthis term, _garum_, had so advanced at the time of Vinidarius in the\r\nfifth century as to lose even its association with any kind of fish.\r\nTerms like _garatum_ (prepared with g.) have been derived from it.\r\nPrepared with the addition of wine it becomes _{oe}nogarum_,--wine\r\nsauce--and dishes prepared with such wine sauce receive the adjective\r\nof _{oe}nogaratum_, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe original _garum_ was no doubt akin to our modern anchovy sauce, at\r\nleast the best quality of the ancient sauce. The principles of\r\nmanufacture surely are alike. _Garum_, like our anchovy sauce, is the\r\n_purée_ of a small fish, named _garus_, as yet unidentified. The fish,\r\nintestines and all, was spiced, pounded, fermented, salted, strained\r\nand bottled for future use. The finest _garum_ was made of the livers\r\nof the fish only, exposed to the sun, fermented, somehow preserved. It\r\nwas an expensive article in old Rome, famed for its medicinal\r\nproperties. Its mode of manufacture has given rise to much criticism\r\nand scorn on the part of medieval and modern commentators and\r\ninterpreters who could not comprehend the \"perverse taste\" of the\r\nancients in placing any value on the \"essence from putrified\r\nintestines of fish.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, _garum_ has been vindicated, confirmed, endorsed, reiterated,\r\nrediscovered, if you please, by modern science! What, pray, is the\r\ndifference in principle between _garum_ (the exact nature of which is\r\nunknown) and the oil of the liver of cod (or less expensive fish)\r\nexposed to the beneficial rays of ultraviolet light--artificial\r\nsunlight--to imbue the oil with an extra large and uniform dose of\r\nvitamin D? The ancients, it appears, knew \"vitamin D\" to exist. Maybe\r\nthey had a different name for \"vitamins,\" maybe none at all. The name\r\ndoes not matter. The thing which they knew, does. They knew the\r\nnutritive value of liver, proven by many formulæ. Pollio, one of the\r\nvicious characters of antiquity, fed murenas (sea-eel) with slaves he\r\nthrew into the _piscina_, the fish pond, and later enjoyed the liver\r\nof the fish.\r\n\r\nSome \"modern\" preparations are astonishingly ancient, and _vice\r\nversa_. Our anchovy sauce is used freely to season fish, to mix with\r\nbutter, to be made into solid anchovy or fish paste. There are sardine\r\npastes, lobster pastes, fish forcemeats found in the larder of every\r\ngood kitchen--preparations of Apician character. A real platter of\r\n_hors d'oeuvres_, an _antipasto_ is not complete unless made according\r\nto certain Apician precepts.\r\n\r\n_Muria_ is salt water, brine, yet it may stand for a fluid in which\r\nfish or meat, fruits or vegetables have been pickled.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the translator of Apicius who takes him literally,\r\nare unconsciously but neatly demonstrated by the work of Danneil. Even\r\nhe, seasoned practitioner, condemns _garum_, _muria_, _asa\r\nf{oe}tida_, because professors before him have done so, because he\r\nforgets that these very materials still form a vital part of some of\r\nhis own sauces only in a different shape, form or under a different\r\nname. Danneil calls some Apician recipes \"incredibly absurd,\"\r\n\"fabulous,\" \"exaggerated,\" but he thinks nothing of the serving of\r\nsimilar combinations in his own establishment every day in the year.\r\n\r\nDanneil would take pride in serving a Veal Cutlet à la Holstein. (What\r\nhave we learned of Apicius in the Northern countries?). The ancient\r\nHolsteiner was not satisfied unless his piece of veal was covered with\r\na nice fat herring. That \"barbarity\" had to be modified by us moderns\r\ninto a veal cutlet, turned in milk and flour, eggs and bread crumbs,\r\nfried, covered with fried eggs, garnished with anchovies or bits of\r\nherring, red beets, capers, and lemon in order to qualify for a\r\nrestaurant favorite and \"best seller.\" Apicius hardly has a dish more\r\ncharacteristic and more bewildering.\r\n\r\nWhat of combinations of fish and meat?\r\n\r\n_De gustibus non est disputandum._ It all goes into the same stomach.\r\nMay it be a sturdy one, and let its owner beware. What of our turkey\r\nand oyster dressing? Of our broiled fish and bacon? Of our clam\r\nchowder, our divine _Bouillabaisse_? If the ingredients and component\r\nparts of such dishes were enumerated in the laconic and careless\r\nApician style, if they were stated without explicit instructions and\r\ndetails (supposed to be known to any good practitioner) we would have\r\nrecipes just as mysterious as any of the Apician formulæ.\r\n\r\nDanneil, like ever so many interpreters, plainly shared the\r\ntraditional belief, the egregious errors of popular history. People\r\nstill are under the spell of the fantastic and fanciful descriptions\r\nof Roman conviviality and gastronomic eccentricities. Indeed, we\r\nrather believe in the insanity of these descriptions than in the\r\ninsane conduct of the average Roman gourmet. It is absurd of course to\r\nassume and to make the world believe that a Roman patrician made a\r\nmeal of _garum_, _laserpitium_, and the like. They used these\r\ncondiments judiciously; any other use thereof is physically\r\nimpossible. They economized their spices which have caused so much\r\ncomment, too. As a matter of fact, they used condiments niggardly and\r\nsparingly as is plainly described in some formulæ, if only for the one\r\ngood and sufficient reason that spices and condiments which often came\r\nfrom Asia and Africa were extremely expensive. This very reason,\r\nperhaps, caused much of the popular outcry against their use, which,\r\nby the way, is merely another form of political propaganda, in which,\r\nas we shall see, the mob guided by the rabble of politicians excelled.\r\n\r\nWe moderns are just as \"extravagant\" (if not more) in the use of\r\nsauces and condiments--Apician sauces, too! Our Worcestershire,\r\ncatsup, chili, chutney, walnut catsup, A I, Harvey's, Punch, Soyer's,\r\nEscoffier's, Oscar's (every culinary coryphee endeavors to create\r\none)--our mustards and condiments in their different forms, if not\r\nactually dating back to Apicius, are, at least lineal descendants from\r\nancient prototypes.\r\n\r\nTo readers little experienced in kitchen practice such phrases (often\r\nrepeated by Apicius) as, \"crush pepper, lovage, marjoram,\" etc.,\r\netc., may appear stereotyped and monotonous. They have not survived in\r\nmodern kitchen parlance, because the practice of using spices, flavors\r\nand aromas has changed. There are now in the market compounds,\r\nextracts, mixtures not used in the old days. Many modern spices come\r\nto us ready ground or mixed, or compounded ready for kitchen use. This\r\nhas the disadvantage in that volatile properties deteriorate more\r\nrapidly and that the goods may be easily adulterated. The Bavarians,\r\nunder Duke Albrecht, in 1553 prohibited the grinding of spices for\r\nthat very reason! Ground spices are time and labor savers, however.\r\nModern kitchen methods have put the old mortar practically out of\r\nexistence, at the expense of quality of the finished product.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"LABOR ITEM\"\r\n\r\nThe enviable Apicius cared naught for either time or labor. He gave\r\nthese two important factors in modern life not a single thought. His\r\nculinary procedures required a prodigious amount of labor and effort\r\non the part of the cooks and their helpers. The labor item never\r\nworried any ancient employer. It was either very cheap or entirely\r\nfree of charge.\r\n\r\nThe selfish gourmet (which gourmet is not selfish?) almost wonders\r\nwhether the abolition of slavery was a well-advised measure in modern\r\nsocial and economic life. Few people appreciate the labor cost in\r\nexcellent cookery and few have any conception of the cost of good food\r\nservice today. Yet all demand both, when \"dining out,\" at least. Who,\r\non the other hand, but a brute would care to dine well, \"taking it out\r\nof the hide of others?\"\r\n\r\nHence we moderns with a craving for _gourmandise_ but minus\r\nappropriations for skilled labor would do well to follow the example\r\nof Alexandre Dumas who cheerfully and successfully attended to his own\r\ncuisine. Despite an extensive fiction practice he found time to edit\r\n\"Le Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine\" and was not above writing mustard\r\nadvertisements, either.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMPTUARY LAWS\r\n\r\nThe appetite of the ancients was at times successfully curbed by\r\nsumptuary laws, cropping out at fairly regular intervals. These laws,\r\nusually given under the pretext of safeguarding the morals of the\r\npeople and accompanied by similar euphonious phrases were, like modern\r\nprohibitions, vicious and virulent effusions of the predatory instinct\r\nin mankind. We cannot give a chronological list of them here, and are\r\nciting them merely to illustrate the difficulty confronting the\r\nprospective ancient host.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Cæsar and Augustus severe laws were passed, fixing\r\nthe sums to be spent for public and private dinners and specifying the\r\nedibles to be consumed. These laws classified gastronomic functions\r\nwith an ingenious eye for system, professing all the time to protect\r\nthe public's morals and health; but they were primarily designed to\r\nreplenish the ever-vanishing contents of the Imperial exchequer and\r\nto provide soft jobs for hordes of enforcers. The amounts allowed to\r\nbe spent for various social functions were so ridiculously small in\r\nour own modern estimation that we may well wonder how a Roman host\r\ncould have ever made a decent showing at a banquet. However, he and\r\nthe cooks managed somehow. Imperial spies and informers were\r\nomnipresent. The market places were policed, the purchases by\r\nprospective hosts carefully noted, dealers selling supplies and cooks\r\n(the more skillful kind usually) hired for the occasion were bribed to\r\nreveal the \"menu.\" Dining room windows had to be located conveniently\r\nto allow free inspection from the street of the dainties served; the\r\npassing Imperial food inspector did not like to intrude upon the\r\nsanctity of the host's home. The pitiable host of those days, his\r\nunenviable guests and the bewildered cooks, however, contrived and\r\nconspired somehow to get up a banquet that was a trifle better than a\r\nChicago quick lunch.\r\n\r\nHow did they do it?\r\n\r\nIn the light of modern experience gained by modern governments\r\ndillydallying with sumptuary legislation that has been discarded as a\r\nbad job some two thousand years ago, the question seems superfluous.\r\n\r\n_Difficile est satyram non scribere!_ To make a long story short: The\r\nRoman host just broke the law, that's all. Indeed, those who made the\r\nlaws were first to break them. The minions, appointed to uphold the\r\nlaw, were easily accounted for. Any food inspector too arduous in the\r\npursuit of his duty was disposed of by dispatching him to the rear\r\nentrance of the festive hall, and was delivered to the tender care of\r\nthe chief cook.\r\n\r\nSuch was the case during the times of Apicius. Indeed, the Roman idea\r\nof good cheer during earlier epochs was provincial enough. It was\r\nsimply barbaric before the Greeks showed the Romans a thing or two in\r\ncookery. The methods of fattening fowl introduced from Greece was\r\nsomething unheard-of! It was outrageous, sacrilegious! Senators,\r\norators and other self-appointed saviors of humanity thundered against\r\nthe vile methods of tickling the human palate, deftly employing all\r\nthe picturesque tam-tam and _élan_ still the stock in trade of ever so\r\nmany modern colleagues in any civilized parliament. The speeches, to\r\nbe sure, passed into oblivion, the fat capons, however, stayed in the\r\nbarnyards until they had acquired the saturation point of tender\r\nluscious calories to be enjoyed by those who could afford them. How\r\nthe capon was \"invented\" is told in a note on the subject.\r\n\r\nMany other so-called luxuries, sausage from Epirus, cherries from the\r\nPontus, oysters from England, were greeted with a studied hostility by\r\nthose who profited from the business of making laws and public\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nEvidently, the time and the place was not very propitious for\r\ngastronomic over-indulgence. Only when the ice was broken, when the\r\ndisregard for law and order had become general through the continuous\r\npractice of contempt for an unpopular sumptuary law, when corruption\r\nhad become wellnigh universal chiefly thanks to the examples set by\r\nthe higher-ups, it was then that the torrent of human passion and\r\nfolly ran riot, exceeding natural bounds, tearing everything with\r\nthem, all that is beautiful and decent, thus swamping the great empire\r\nbeyond the hopes for any recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPICIUS THE WRITER\r\n\r\nMost of the Apician directions are vague, hastily jotted down,\r\ncarelessly edited. One of the chief reasons for the eternal\r\nmisunderstandings! Often the author fails to state the quantities to\r\nbe used. He has a mania for giving undue prominence to expensive\r\nspices and other (quite often irrelevant) ingredients. Plainly,\r\nApicius was no writer, no editor. He was a cook. He took it for\r\ngranted that spices be used within the bounds of reason, but he could\r\nnot afford to forget them in his formulæ.\r\n\r\nApicius surely pursues the correct culinary principle of incorporating\r\nthe flavoring agents during the process of cooking, contrary to many\r\nmoderns who, vigorously protesting against \"highly seasoned\" and\r\n\"rich\" food, and who, craving for \"something plain\" proceed to\r\ninundate perfectly good, plain roast or boiled dishes with a deluge of\r\nany of the afore-mentioned commercial \"sauces\" that have absolutely no\r\nrelation to the dish and that have no mission other than to grant\r\nrelief from the deadening monotony of \"plain\" food. Chicken or mutton,\r\nbeef or venison, finnan haddie or brook trout, eggs or oysters thus\r\n\"sauced,\" taste all alike--sauce! To use such ready-made sauces with\r\ndishes cooked _à l'anglaise_ is logical, excusable, almost advisable.\r\nEven the most ascetic of men cannot resist the insidiousness of spicy\r\ndelights, nor can he for any length of time endure the insipidity of\r\nplain food sans sauce. Hence the popularity of such sauces amongst\r\npeople who do not observe the correct culinary principle of seasoning\r\nfood judiciously, befitting its character, without spoiling but rather\r\nin enhancing its characteristics and in bringing out its flavor at the\r\nright time, namely during coction to give the kindred aromas a chance\r\nto blend well.\r\n\r\nContinental nations, adhering to this important principle of cookery\r\n(inherited from Apicius) would not dream of using ready-made (English)\r\nsauces.\r\n\r\nWe have witnessed real crimes being perpetrated upon perfectly\r\nseasoned and delicately flavored _entrées_. We have watched\r\nill-advised people maltreat good things, cooked to perfection, even\r\nbefore they tasted them, sprinkling them as a matter of habit, with\r\nquantities of salt and pepper, paprika, cayenne, daubing them with\r\nmustards of every variety or swamping them with one or several of the\r\ncommercial sauce preparations. \"Temperamental\" chefs, men who know\r\ntheir art, usually explode at the sight of such wantonness. Which\r\npainter would care to see his canvas varnished with all the hues in\r\nthe rainbow by a patron afflicted with such a taste?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the craving for excessive flavoring is an olfactory delirium,\r\na pathological case, as yet unfathomed like the excessive craving for\r\nliquor, and, being a problem for the medical fraternity, it is only of\r\nsecondary importance to gastronomy.\r\n\r\nTo say that the Romans were afflicted on a national scale with a\r\nstrange spice mania (as some interpreters want us to believe) would be\r\nequivalent to the assertion that all wine-growing nations were nations\r\nof drunkards. As a matter of fact, the reverse is the truth.\r\n\r\nApicius surely would be surprised at some things we enjoy. _Voilà_, a\r\nrecipe, \"modern,\" not older than half a century, given by us in the\r\nApician style or writing: Take liquamen, pepper, cayenne, eggs, lemon,\r\nolive oil, vinegar, white wine, anchovies, onions, tarragon, pickled\r\ncucumbers, parsley, chervil, hard-boiled eggs, capers, green peppers,\r\nmustard, chop, mix well, and serve.\r\n\r\nDo you recognize it? This formula sounds as phantastic, as \"weird\" and\r\nas \"vile\" as any of the Apician concoctions, confusing even a\r\nwell-trained cook because we stated neither the title of this\r\npreparation nor the mode of making it, nor did we name the ingredients\r\nin their proper sequence. This mystery was conceived with an\r\nillustrative purpose which will be explained later, which may and may\r\nnot have to do with the mystery of Apicius. Consider, for a moment,\r\nthis mysterious creation No. 2: Take bananas, oranges, cherries,\r\nflavored with bitter almonds, fresh pineapple, lettuce, fresh peaches,\r\nplums, figs, grapes, apples, nuts, cream cheese, olive oil, eggs,\r\nwhite wine, vinegar, cayenne, lemon, salt, white pepper, dry mustard,\r\ntarragon, rich sour cream, chop, mix, whip well.\r\n\r\nWorse yet! Instead of having our appetite aroused the very perusal of\r\nthis quasi-Apician _mixtum compositum_ repels every desire to partake\r\nof it. We are justly tempted to condemn it as being utterly\r\nimpossible. Yet every day hundreds of thousand portions of it are sold\r\nunder the name of special fruit salad with _mayonnaise mousseuse_. The\r\nabove mystery No. 1 is the justly popular tartar sauce.\r\n\r\nThus we could go on analyzing modern preparations and make them appear\r\nas outlandish things. Yet we relish them every day. The ingredients,\r\nobnoxious in great quantities, are employed with common sense. We are\r\nnot mystified seeing them in print; they are usually given in clear\r\nlogical order. This is not the style of Apicius, however.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATIN CUNNING\r\n\r\nWe can hardly judge Apicius by what he has revealed but we rather\r\nshould try to discover what he--purposely or otherwise--has concealed\r\nif we would get a good idea of the ancient kitchen. This thought\r\noccurred to us at the eleventh hour, after years of study of the text\r\nand after almost despairing of a plausible solution of its mysteries.\r\nAnd it seems surprising that Apicius has never been suspected before\r\nof withholding information essential to the successful practice of his\r\nrather hypothetical and empirical formulæ. The more we scrutinize\r\nthem, the more we become convinced that the author has omitted vital\r\ndirections--same as we did purposely with the two modern examples\r\nabove. Many of the Apician recipes are dry enumerations of ingredients\r\nsupposed to belong to a given dish or sauce. It is well-known that in\r\nchemistry (cookery is but applied chemistry) the knowledge of the\r\nrules governing the quantities and the sequence of the ingredients,\r\ntheir manipulation, either separately or jointly, either successively\r\nor simultaneously, is a very important matter, and that violation or\r\nignorance of the process may spell failure at any stage of the\r\nexperiment. In the kitchen this is particularly true of baking and\r\nsoup and sauce making, the most intricate of culinary operations.\r\n\r\nThere may have been two chief reasons for concealing necessary\r\ninformation. Apicius, or more likely the professional collectors of\r\nthe recipes, may have considered technical elaboration of the formulæ\r\nquite superfluous on the assumption that the formulæ were for\r\nprofessional use only. Every good practitioner knows, with ingredients\r\nor components given, what manipulations are required, what effects are\r\ndesired. Even in the absence of detailed specifications, the\r\nexperienced practitioner will be able to divine correct proportions,\r\nby intuition. As a matter of fact, in cookery the mention in the right\r\nplace of a single ingredient, like in poetry the right word, often\r\nsuffices to conjure up before the gourmet's mental eye vistas of\r\ndelight. Call it inspiration, association of ideas or what you please,\r\na single word may often prove a guide, a savior.\r\n\r\nLet us remember that in Apicii days paper (parchment, papyrus) and\r\nwriting materials were expensive and that, moreover, the ability of\r\ncorrect logical and literary expression was necessarily limited in the\r\ncase of a practising cook who, after all, must have been the collector\r\nof the Apician formulæ. This is sufficiently proven by the _lingua\r\ncoquinaria_, the vulgar Latin of our old work. In our opinion, the\r\nancient author did not consider it worth his while to give anything\r\nbut the most indispensable information in the tersest form. This he\r\ncertainly did. A comparison of his literary performance with that of\r\nthe artistic and accomplished writer of the Renaissance, Platina, will\r\nat once show up Apicius as a hard-working practical cook, a man who\r\nknew his business but who could not tell what he knew.\r\n\r\nLike ever so many of his successors, he could not refrain from\r\nbeginning and concluding many of his articles with such superfluities\r\nas \"take this\" and \"And serve,\" etc., all of which shows him up as a\r\ngenuine cook. These articles, written in the most laconic language\r\npossible--the language of a very busy, very harassed, very hurried\r\nman, are the literary product of a cook, or several of them.\r\n\r\nThe other chief motive for condensing or obscuring his text has a more\r\nsubtle foundation. Indeed, we are surprised that we should possess so\r\ngreat a collection of recipes, representing to him who could use them\r\ncertain commercial and social value. The preservation of Apicius seems\r\nentirely accidental. Experienced cooks were in demand in Apicii times;\r\nthe valuation of their ministrations increased proportionately to the\r\nprogress in gastronomy and to the prosperity of the nation. During\r\nRome's frugal era, up to 200 B.C. the primitive cooks were just slaves\r\nand household chattels; but the development of their trade into an\r\nart, stimulated by foreign precepts, imported principally from Greece,\r\nSicily and Asia Minor, opened up to the practitioners not only the\r\ndoor to freedom from servitude but it offered even positions of wealth\r\nwith social and political standing, often arousing the envy, satire,\r\ncriticism of bona-fide politicians, journalists, moralists, satirists\r\nand of the ever-present hordes of parasites and hangers-on. Some cooks\r\nbecame confidants, even friends and advisors of men in high places,\r\nemperors, (cf. life of Vitellius) and through their subtle influence\r\nupon the mighty they may have contributed in no mean measure to the\r\nfate of the nation. But such invisible string-pullers have not been\r\nconfined to those days alone. (Take Rasputin! Take the valet to\r\nWilliam I, reputed to have had more \"say\" than the mighty Bismarck,\r\nwho, as it developed, got \"the air\" while the valet died in his\r\nberth.)\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, what potential power reposed in a greasy cookery\r\nmanuscript! And, if so, why bare such wonderful secrets to Tom, Dick\r\nand Harry?\r\n\r\nWeights and measures are given by Apicius in some instances. But just\r\nsuch figures can be used artfully to conceal a trap. Any mediocre\r\ncook, gaining possession of a choice collection of detailed and\r\nitemized recipes would have been placed in an enviable position.\r\nExperimenting for some time (at his master's expense) he would soon\r\nreach that perfection when he could demand a handsome compensation for\r\nhis ministrations. Throughout antique times, throughout the middle\r\nages down to the present day (when patent laws no longer protect a\r\nsecret) strict secrecy was maintained around many useful and lucrative\r\nformulæ, not only by cooks, but also by physicians, alchemists and the\r\nvarious scientists, artisans and craftsmen. Only the favorite\r\napprentice would be made heir to or shareholder in this important\r\nstock in trade after his worthiness had been proven to his master's\r\nsatisfaction, usually by the payment of a goodly sum of\r\nmoney--apprentice's pay. We remember reading in Lanciani (Rodolfo L.:\r\nAncient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries) how in the entire\r\nhistory of Rome there is but one voice, that of a solitary,\r\nnoble-minded physician, complaining about the secrecy that was being\r\nmaintained by his colleagues as regards their science. To be sure,\r\nthose fellows had every reason in the world for keeping quiet: so\r\npreposterous were their methods in most cases! This secrecy indeed\r\nmust have carried with it a blessing in disguise. Professional reserve\r\nwas not its object. The motive was purely commercial.\r\n\r\nSeeing where the information given by Apicius is out of reason and\r\nunintelligible we are led to believe that such text is by no means to\r\nbe taken very literally. On the contrary, it is quite probable that\r\nweights and measures are not correct: they are quite likely to be of\r\nan artful and studied unreliability. A secret private code is often\r\nemployed, necessitating the elimination or transposition of certain\r\nwords, figures or letters before the whole will become intelligible\r\nand useful. If by any chance an uninitiated hand should attempt to\r\ngrasp such veiled directions, failure would be certain. We confess to\r\nhave employed at an early stage of our own career this same strategy\r\nand time-honored camouflage to protect a precious lot of recipes.\r\nPromptly we lost this unctuous manuscript, as we feared we would; if\r\nnot deciphered today, the book has long since been discarded as being\r\na record of the ravings of a madman.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the printing press changed the situation. With Platina,\r\nca. 1474, an avalanche of cookery literature started. The secrets of\r\nScappi, \"_cuoco secreto_\" to the pope, were \"scooped\" by an\r\nenterprising Venetian printer in 1570. The guilds of French mustard\r\nmakers and sauce cooks (precursors of modern food firms and\r\nmanufacturers of ready-made condiments) were a powerful tribe of\r\nsecret mongers in the middle ages. English gastronomic literature of\r\nthe 16th, 17th and even the 18th century is crowded with \"closets\r\nopened,\" \"secrets let out\" and other alluring titles purporting to\r\nregale the prospective reader with profitable and appetizing secrets\r\nof all sorts. Kitchen secrets became commercial articles.\r\n\r\nThese remarks should suffice to illustrate the assumption that the\r\nApicius book was not created for publication but that it is a\r\ncollection of abridged formulæ for private use, a treasure chest as it\r\nwere, of some cook, which after the demise of its owner, collector,\r\noriginator, a curious world could not resist to play with, although\r\nbut a few experienced masters held the key, being able to make use of\r\nthe recipes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAT DIET\r\n\r\nIn perusing Apicius only one or two instances of cruelty to animals\r\nhave come to our attention (cf. recipes No. 140 and 259). Cruel\r\nmethods of slaughter were common. Some of the dumb beasts that were to\r\nfeed man and even had to contribute to his pleasures and enjoyment of\r\nlife by giving up their own lives often were tortured in cruel,\r\nunspeakable ways. The belief existed that such methods might increase\r\nthe quality, palatability and flavor of the meat. Such beliefs and\r\nmethods may still be encountered on the highways and byways in Europe\r\nand Asia today. Since the topic, strictly speaking does not belong\r\nhere, we cannot depict it in detail, and in passing make mention of it\r\nto refer students interested in the psychology of the ancients to such\r\ndetails as are found in the writings of Plutarch and other ancient\r\nwriters during the early Christian era. It must be remembered,\r\nhowever, that such writers (including the irreproachable Plutarch)\r\nwere advocates of vegetarianism. Some passages are inspired by true\r\nhumane feeling, but much appears to be written in the interest of\r\nvegetarianism.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were not such confirmed meat eaters as the modern Western\r\nnations, merely because the meat supply was not so ample. Beef was\r\nscarce because of the shortage of large pastures. The cow was sacred,\r\nthe ox furnished motive power, and, after its usefulness was gone, the\r\nmuscular old brute had little attraction for the gourmet. Today lives\r\na race of beef eaters. Our beef diet, no doubt is bound to change\r\nsomewhat. Already the world's grazing grounds are steadily\r\ndiminishing. The North American prairies are being parcelled off into\r\nsmall farms the working conditions of which make beef raising\r\nexpensive. The South American pampas and a strip of coastal land in\r\nAustralia now furnish the bulk of the world's beef supply. Perhaps\r\nNorthern Asia still holds in store a large future supply of meat but\r\nthis no doubt will be claimed by Asia. Already North America is\r\nacclimating the Lapland reindeer to offset the waning beef, to utilize\r\nits Northern wastes.\r\n\r\nWith the increasing shortage of beef, with the increasing facilities\r\nfor raising chicken and pork, a reversion to Apician methods of\r\ncookery and diet is not only probably but actually seems inevitable.\r\nThe ancient bill of fare and the ancient methods of cookery were\r\nentirely guided by the supply of raw materials--precisely like ours.\r\nThey had no great food stores nor very efficient marketing and\r\ntransportation systems, food cold storage. They knew, however, to take\r\ncare of what there was. They were good managers.\r\n\r\nSuch atrocities as the willful destruction of huge quantities of food\r\nof every description on the one side and starving multitudes on the\r\nother as seen today never occurred in antiquity.\r\n\r\nMany of the Apician dishes will not appeal to the beef eaters. It is\r\nworthy of note that much criticism was heaped upon Apicius some 200\r\nyears ago in England when beef eating became fashionable in that\r\ncountry. The art of Apicius requires practitioners of superior\r\nintellect. Indeed, it requires a superior clientèle to appreciate\r\nApician dishes. But practitioners that would pass the requirements of\r\nthe Apician school are scarce in the kitchens of the beef eaters. We\r\ncannot blame meat eaters for rejecting the average _chef d'{oe}uvre_\r\nset before them by a mediocre cook who has learned little besides the\r\nroasting or broiling of meats. Once the average man has acquired a\r\ntaste for the refined compositions made by a talented and experienced\r\ncook, say, a composition of meats, vegetables or cereals, properly\r\n\"balanced\" by that intuition that never fails the real artist, the\r\nfortunate diner will eventually curtail the preponderant meat diet. A\r\nglance at some Chinese and Japanese methods of cookery may perhaps\r\nconvince us of the probability of these remarks.\r\n\r\nNothing is more perplexing and more alarming than a new dish, but we\r\ncan see in a reversion to Apician cookery methods only a dietetic\r\nbenefit accruing to this so-called white race of beef eaters.\r\n\r\nApicius certainly excels in the preparation of vegetable dishes (cf.\r\nhis cabbage and asparagus) and in the utilization of parts of food\r\nmaterials that are today considered inferior, hardly worth preparing\r\nfor the table except by the very careful and economical housekeeper.\r\nProperly prepared, many of these things are good, often more\r\nnutritious than the dearer cuts, and sometimes they are really\r\ndelicious.\r\n\r\nOne has but to study the methods of ancient and intelligent people who\r\nhave suffered for thousands of years under the perennial shortage of\r\nfood supplies in order to understand and to appreciate Apician\r\nmethods. Be it far from us to advocate their methods, or to wish upon\r\nus the conditions that engendered such methods; for such practices\r\nhave been pounded into these people by dire necessity. They have\r\ngraduated from the merciless school of hunger.\r\n\r\nFood materials, we repeat, were never as cheap and as abundant as they\r\nare today. But who can say that they always will be so in the future?\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENCE CONFIRMING ANCIENT METHODS\r\n\r\nWe must not overlook the remarkable intuition displayed by the\r\nancients in giving preference to foods with body- and blood-building\r\nproperties. For instance, the use of liver, particularly fish liver\r\nalready referred to. The correctness of their choice is now being\r\nconfirmed by scientific re-discoveries. The young science of nutrition\r\nis important enough to an individual who would stimulate or preserve\r\nhis health. But since constitutions are different, the most carefully\r\nconceived dietary may apply to one particular individual only,\r\nprovided, however, that our present knowledge of nutrition be correct\r\nand final. This knowledge, as a matter of fact, is being revised and\r\nchanged constantly.\r\n\r\nIf dietetics, therefore, were important enough to have any bearing at\r\nall upon the well-defined methods of cookery, we might go into detail\r\nanalyzing ancient methods from that point of view. To call attention\r\nto the \"economy,\" the stewardship, or craftsmanship, in ancient\r\nmethods and to the truly remarkable intuition that guided the ancient\r\ncooks is more important. Without these qualities there can be no\r\nhigher gastronomy. Without high gastronomy no high civilization is\r\npossible. The honest and experienced nutrition expert, though perhaps\r\npersonally opposed to elaborate dining, will discover through close\r\nstudy of the ancient precepts interesting pre-scientific and\r\nwell-balanced combinations and methods designed to jealously guard the\r\nvitamins and dietetic values in dishes that may appear curiously \"new\"\r\nto the layman that would nevertheless receive the unqualified approval\r\nof modern science.\r\n\r\nWe respect the efforts of modern dietitians and food reformers; but we\r\nare far removed from the so-called \"simple\" and \"plain\" foods\r\nadvocated by some well-meaning individuals. With the progress of\r\ncivilization we are farther and farther drifting away from it. Even\r\nbarbaric and beastly food is not \"simple.\"\r\n\r\nThis furtive \"intuition\" in cookery (in the absence of scientific\r\nfacts because of the inability of cooks to transform empirical\r\ntraditions into practical rules emanating from understood principles)\r\nstill prevails today. It guides great chefs, saves time spent in\r\nscientific study.\r\n\r\nThe much criticized \"unnatural union of sugar and meats\" of the\r\nancients still exists today in many popular examples of cookery: lamb\r\nand mint sauce, steak and catsup, mutton and currant jelly, pork and\r\napples (in various forms), oyster cocktail, poultry and compôte, goose\r\nwith apple and raisin dressing, venison and Cumberland sauce, mince\r\npie, plum pudding--typical survivals of ancient traditions.\r\n\"Intuition\" is still preceding exact science, and \"unnatural unions\"\r\nas in social, political and any other form of life, seem to be the\r\nrule rather than the exception.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISGUISING FOODS\r\n\r\nApicius is often blamed for his endeavor to serve one thing under the\r\nguise of another. The reasons for such deceptions are various ones.\r\nFashion dictated it. Cooks were not considered \"clever\" unless they\r\ncould surprise guests with a commonplace food material so skillfully\r\nprepared that identification was difficult or impossible. Another\r\nreason was the absence of good refrigeration, making \"masking\"\r\nnecessary. Also the ambition of hosts to serve a cheaper food for a\r\nmore expensive one--veal for chicken, pork for partridge, and so on.\r\nBut do we not indulge in the same \"stunts\" today? We either do it with\r\nthe intention of deceiving or to \"show off.\" Have we not \"Mock Turtle\r\nSoup,\" _Mouton à la Chasseur_, mutton prepared to taste like venison,\r\n\"chicken\" salad made of veal or of rabbit? In Europe even today much\r\nof the traditional roast hare is caught in the alley, and it belongs\r\nto a feline species. \"Roof hare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD ADULTERATIONS\r\n\r\nThere is positive evidence of downright frauds and vicious food\r\nadulteration in the times of Apicius. The old rascal himself is not\r\nabove giving directions for rose wine without roses, or how to make a\r\nspoiled honey marketable, and other similar adulterations. Those of\r\nour readers with sensitive gastronomic instinct had better skip the\r\nparagraphs discussing the treatment of \"birds with a goatish smell.\"\r\nBut the old food adulterators are no match for their modern\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nToo, some of our own shams are liable to misinterpretation. In\r\ncenturies to come our own modern recipes for \"Scotch Woodcock\" or\r\n\"Welsh rabbit\" may be interpreted as attempts on our part to hoodwink\r\nguests by making game birds and rabbits out of cheese and bread, like\r\nTrimalchio's culinary artists are reputed to have made suckling pigs\r\nout of dough, partridges of veal, chicken of tunny fish, and _vice\r\nversa_. What indeed would a serious-minded research worker a thousand\r\nyears hence if unfamiliar with our culinary practice and traditions\r\nmake of such terms as _pette de nonne_ as found in many old French\r\ncookery books, or of the famous _suttelties_ (subtleties)--the\r\nconfections once so popular at medieval weddings?\r\n\r\nThe ramifications of the _lingua coquinaria_ in any country are\r\nmanifold, and the culinary wonderland is full of pitfalls even for the\r\nexperienced gourmet.\r\n\r\n\r\nREACHING THE LIMIT\r\n\r\nLike in all other branches of ancient endeavor, cookery had reached a\r\nstate of perfection around the time of Apicius when the only chance\r\nfor successful continuation of the art lay in the conquest of new\r\nfields, i.e., in expansion, generalization, elaboration and in\r\ninfluence from foreign sources. We have witnessed this in French\r\ncookery which for the last hundred years has successfully expanded and\r\nhas virtually captured the civilized parts of the globe, subject\r\nhowever, always to regional and territorial modifications.\r\n\r\nThis desirable expansion of antique cookery did not take place. It was\r\nviolently and rather suddenly checked principally by political and\r\neconomic events during the centuries following Apicius, perhaps\r\nprincipally by the forces that caused the great migration (the very\r\nquest of food!). Suspension ensued instead. The heirs to the ancient\r\nculture were not yet ready for their marvelous heritage. Besides their\r\ncultural unpreparedness, the cookery of the ancients, like their\r\nhumor, did not readily appeal to the \"Nordic\" heirs. Both are so\r\nsubtle and they depend so much upon the psychology and the economic\r\nconditions of a people, and they thus presented almost unsurmountable\r\nobstacles to the invaders. Still lo! already in the fifth century, the\r\nGoth Vinithaharjis, started to collect the Apician precepts.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR PREDECESSORS\r\n\r\nThe usefulness in our days of Apicius as a practical cookery book has\r\nbeen questioned, but we leave this to our readers to decide after the\r\nperusal of this translation.\r\n\r\nIf not useful in the kitchen, if we cannot grasp its moral, what,\r\nthen, is Apicius? Merely a curio?\r\n\r\nThe existing manuscripts cannot be bought; the old printed editions\r\nare highly priced by collectors, and they are rare. Still, the few\r\npersons able to read the messages therein cannot use them: they are\r\nnot practitioners in cookery.\r\n\r\nNone of the Apician editors (except Danneil and the writer) were\r\nexperienced practising gastronomers. Humelbergius, Lister, Bernhold\r\nwere medical men. Two serious students, Schuch and Wuestemann, gave up\r\nacademic positions to devote a year to the study of modern cookery in\r\norder to be able to interpret Apicius. These enthusiasts overlooked,\r\nhowever, two facts: Apicius cannot be understood by inquiring into\r\nmodern average cookery methods, nor can complete mastery of cookery,\r\npractical as well as theoretical, including the historical and\r\nphysiological aspects of gastronomy be acquired in one year. Richard\r\nGollmer, another Apicius editor, declares that the results of this\r\ncourse in gastronomy were negative. We might add here that Schuch's\r\nedition of Apicius, apart from the unwarranted inclusion of the\r\n_excerpta_ of Vinidarius is the least reliable of all editions.\r\n\r\nGollmer published a free version of Apicius in German in 1909. If he\r\ndid not render the original very faithfully and literally, it must\r\nbe said in all fairness that his methods of procedure were correct.\r\nGollmer attempted to interpret the ancient text for the modern\r\nreader. Unfortunately he based his work upon that of Schuch and\r\nWuestemann and Lister. A year or so later Eduard Danneil published a\r\nversion of his own, also based on Schuch. This editor is a\r\npractising _chef_,--_Hof-Traiteur_ or caterer to the court of one of\r\nthe then reigning princes of Germany. Danneil's preface is dated\r\n1897, though the date of publication is 1911. In view of the fact\r\nthat Gollmer had covered the ground and that Danneil added nothing\r\nnew to Apician lore, his publication seems superfluous. Danneil's\r\ntranslation differs in that the translator adhered literally to the\r\nquestionable Schuch version whereas Gollmer aspired to a free and\r\nreadable version for an educated public.\r\n\r\nA comparison reveals that the one author is not a cook while the other\r\nis not a savant.\r\n\r\nLike the scholars who tried their hand at cookery, there are a number\r\nof worthy and ambitious practitioners of cookery who have endeavored\r\nto reach the heights of scholarship, among them Carême and Soyer, men\r\nof great calibre. Unfortunately, the span of human life is short, the\r\ncapacity of the human mind is limited. Fruitful achievements in widely\r\ndifferent fields of endeavor by one man are rare. This is merely to\r\nillustrate the extreme difficulty encountered by anyone bent on a\r\nventuresome exploration of our subject and the very narrow chances of\r\nsuccess to extricate himself with grace from the two-thousand year old\r\nlabyrinth of philosophical, historical, linguistical and gastronomical\r\ntechnicalities.\r\n\r\nThis task will become comparatively easy, however, and surely\r\ninteresting and with a foreboding of many delights and surprises if we\r\npenetrate the jungle aided by the experience of predecessors,\r\nsteadfastly relying on the \"theory of evolution\" as a guide, and armed\r\nwith the indispensable equipment for gastronomical research, i.e., the\r\npractical and technical knowledge of cookery, mastery of languages,\r\naugmented by practical experience gathered by observations and travel\r\nin many lands, and last but not least, if we are obsessed with the\r\nfixed idea that so menial a subject is worth all the bother.\r\n\r\nWe have purposely refrained from presenting here a treatise in the\r\ncustomary scientific style. We know, there are repetitions,\r\ndigressions, excursions into adjacent fields that may be open to\r\ncriticism. We really do not aim to make this critical review an\r\nexhibition of scholarly attainments with all the necessary brevity,\r\nclarity, scientific restraint and etiquette. Such style would be\r\nentirely out of our line. Any bookish flavor attaching itself to our\r\nwork would soon replace a natural fragrance we aim to preserve, namely\r\nour close contact with the subject. Those interested in the scholarly\r\nwork that has been contributed to this cause are referred to modern\r\nmen like Vollmer, Giarratano, Brandt and others named in the\r\nbibliography. Of the older scientists there is Martinus Lister, a man\r\nwhose knowledge of the subject is very respectable and whose devotion\r\nto it is unbounded, whose integrity as a scientist is above reproach.\r\nHis notes and commentaries together with those of Humelbergius, the\r\neditor-physician of Zürich, will be enjoyed and read with profit by\r\nevery antiquary. The labors of Bernhold and Schuch are meritorious\r\nalso, the work, time, and _esprit_ these men have devoted to the\r\nsubject is enormous. As for Torinus, the opinions are divided.\r\nHumelbergius ignores him, Gryphius pirates him, Lister scorns him, we\r\nlike him. Lister praises his brother physician, Humelbergius: _Doctus\r\nquidem vir et modestus!_ So he is! The notes by Humelbergius alone and\r\nhis word: _Nihil immutare ausi summus!_ entitles him to all the praise\r\nLister can bestow. Unfortunately, the sources of his information are\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nLacking these, we have of course no means of ascertaining whether he\r\nalways lived up to his word that he is not privileged to change.\r\nHumelbergius and Lister may have made contributions of value from a\r\nphilological point of view but their work appears to have less merit\r\ngastronomically than that of Torinus. To us the Basel editor often\r\nseems surprisingly correct in cases where the gastronomical character\r\nof a formula is in doubt.\r\n\r\nIn rendering the ancient text into English we, too, have endeavored to\r\nfollow Humelbergii example; hence the almost literal translation of\r\nthe originals before us, namely, Torinus, Humelbergius, Lister,\r\nBernhold, Schuch and the latest, Giarratano-Vollmer which reached us\r\nin 1925 in time for collating. We have wavered often and long whether\r\nor not to place alongside this English version the original Latin\r\ntext, but due to the divergencies we have finally abandoned the idea,\r\nfor practical reasons alone.\r\n\r\nIn translating we have endeavored to clear up mysteries and errors;\r\nthis interpretation is a work quite apart and independent of that of\r\nthe translation. It is merely the sum and substance of our practical\r\nexperience in gastronomy. It is not to be taken as an attempt to\r\nchange the original but is presented in good faith, to be taken on its\r\nface value. This interpretation appears in the form of notes directly\r\nunder each article, for quick reference and it is our wish that it be\r\nof some practical service in contributing to the general understanding\r\nand appreciation of our ancient book.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of expediency we have numbered and placed a title (in\r\nEnglish) on each ancient recipe, following the example of Schuch. This\r\nprocedure may be counted against us as a liberty taken with the text.\r\nThe text has remained inviolate. We have merely aimed at a rational\r\nand legible presentation--work within the province and the duty of an\r\neditor-translator and technical expert.\r\n\r\nWe do not claim credit for any other work connected with the task of\r\nmaking this most unique book accessible to the English speaking public\r\nand for the competition for scholastic laurels we wish to stay _hors\r\nde combat_. We feel we are not privileged to pass final judgment upon\r\nthe excellent work done by sympathetic and erudite admirers of our\r\nancient book throughout the better part of four centuries, and we\r\ncannot side with one or the other in questions philological,\r\nhistorical, or of any other nature, except gastronomical. We are\r\ndeeply indebted to all of our predecessors and through conversations\r\nand extensive correspondence with other modern researchers, Dr. Edward\r\nBrandt and Dr. Margaret B. Wilson, we are enabled to predict new\r\ndevelopments in Apician research. The debates of the scientists, it\r\nappears, are not yet closed.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the various differences of opinion in minor\r\nquestions are of little import to us as compared with the delightful\r\nfact that we here possess an Apicius, not only a genuine Roman, but an\r\n\"honest-to-goodness\" human being besides. A jolly fellow is Apicius\r\nwith a basketful of happy messages for a hungry world. We therefore\r\nwant to make this work of ours the entertainment and instruction the\r\nsubject deserves to be. If we succeed in proving that Apicius is not a\r\nmummified, bone-dry classic but that he has \"the goods,\" namely some\r\nreal human merit we shall have accomplished more than the savants to\r\nwhom this popularization of our hero has been denied so far.\r\n\r\nAfter all, we live in a practical age, and it is the practical value,\r\nthe matter-of-fact contribution to our happiness and well-being by the\r\nwork of any man, ancient or modern, which counts in these days of\r\nmaterialism.\r\n\r\nSo let us tell the truth, and let us sum up in a few words:\r\n\r\nWe do not know who Apicius is. We do not know who wrote the book\r\nbearing his name. We do not know when it was written, or whether it\r\nis of Greek or of Roman origin. Furthermore, we do not understand many\r\nof its precepts!\r\n\r\nWe do know, however, that it is the oldest work dealing with the food\r\nand the cookery of the ancient world's greatest empire, and that, as\r\nsuch, it is of the utmost interest and importance to us.\r\n\r\nIn this sense we have endeavored to treat the book.\r\n\r\n\r\nDINING IN APICIAN STYLE\r\n\r\nPast attempts to dine à l'Apicius invariably have ended disastrously.\r\nEager _gourmets_, ever on the look-out for something new, and curious\r\nscholars have attempted to prepare dishes in the manner prescribed by\r\nApicius. Most of such experimenters have executed the old precepts\r\nliterally, instead of trying to enter into their spirit.\r\n\r\n\"_Das Land der Griechen mit der Seele suchen!_\" says Goethe. The\r\nfriends of Apicius who failed to heed this advice, also failed to\r\ncomprehend the precepts, they were cured of their curiosity, and\r\nblamed the master for their own shortcomings. Christina, queen of\r\nSweden, was made ill by an attempt of this kind to regale her majesty\r\nwith a rare Apician morsel while in Italy as the guest of some noble.\r\nBut history is dark on this point. Here perhaps Apicius is blamed for\r\na dastardly attempt on the royal lady's life for this daughter of the\r\nProtestant Gustavus Adolphus was in those days not the only crowned\r\nhead in danger of being dispatched by means of some tempting morsel\r\nsmilingly proffered by some titled rogue. A deadly dish under the\r\ndisguise of \"Apicius\" must have been particularly convenient in those\r\ndays for such sinister purposes. The sacred obligations imposed upon\r\n\"barbarians\" by the virtue of hospitality had been often forgotten by\r\nthe super-refined hosts of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nBut Apicius continued to prove unhealthful to a number of later\r\namateurs. Lister, with his perfectly sincere endeavor to popularize\r\nApicius, achieved precisely the opposite. The publication of his work\r\nin London, 1705, was the signal for a number of people, scholars and\r\nothers, to crack jokes, not at the expense of Apicius, as they\r\nimagined, but to expose their own ignorance. Smollet, Dr. W. King\r\n(\"Poor starving wit\"--Swift), Dr. Hunter and others. More recently, a\r\nparty of English dandies, chaperoned, if we remember correctly, by the\r\nponderous George Augustus Sala, fared likewise badly in their attempt\r\nto stage a Roman feast, being under the impression that the days of\r\nTiberius and the mid-Victorian era may be joined with impunity, _à la\r\nminute_, as it were.\r\n\r\nEven later, in one of the (alas! not so many) good books on\r\ngastronomy, \"Kettner's Book of the Table,\" London, 1877, the excellent\r\nauthor dismisses Roman cookery with a few lines of \"warning.\" Kettner,\r\nadmirer of Sala, evidently was still under the baneful influence.\r\nTwenty years later, Danneil, colleague of Kettner's, joined the chorus\r\nof \"irreverent critics.\" They all based their judgment on mere idle\r\nconversation, resulting from disappointments in ill-fated attempts to\r\ncook in the Apician style. Even the best experts, it appears, fall\r\nvictims to the mysterious spell surrounding, protecting things of\r\nsacred antiquity, hovering like an avenging angel over them, to ward\r\noff all \"irreverent critics\" and curious intruders.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROOF OF THE PUDDING\r\n\r\nAfter all, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. This homely\r\nsolid wisdom is literally true of our good old Apicius. We have tested\r\nmany of his precepts, and have found them practical, good, even\r\ndelightful. A few, we will say, are of the rarest beauty and of\r\nconsummate perfection in the realm of gastronomy, while some others\r\nagain are totally unintelligible for reasons sufficiently explained.\r\nAlways remembering Humelbergius, we have \"laid off\" of these torsos,\r\nrecommending them to some more competent commentator. Many of the\r\nancient formula tried have our unqualified gastronomic approval.\r\n\r\nIf our work has not differed from that of our predecessors, if it\r\nshows the same human frailties and foibles, we have at least one mark\r\nof distinction among the editors in that we have subjected the\r\noriginal to severe practical tests as much as this is possible with\r\nour modern food materials. We experienced difficulty in securing\r\ncertain spices long out of use. Nevertheless, the experience of\r\nactually sampling Apician dishes and the sensation of dining in the\r\nmanners of the Cæsars are worth the trouble we took with Apicius. This\r\nis a feeling of partaking of an entirely new dish, met with both\r\nexpectancy and with suspicion, accentuated by the hallowed traditions\r\nsurrounding it which has rewarded us for the time and expense devoted\r\nto the subject. Ever since we have often dined in the classical\r\nfashion of the ancients who, after all, were but \"folks\" like\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nIf you care not for the carnal pleasures in Apician gastronomy--for\r\n_gulam_,--if you don't give a fig for philology, there still is something\r\nhealthy, something infinitely soothing and comforting--\"educational\"--in\r\nthe perusal of the old book and in similar records.\r\n\r\nWhen we see Apicius, the famous \"epicure\" descending to the very level\r\nof a common food \"fakir,\" giving directions for making Liburnian oil\r\nthat has never seen that country....\r\n\r\nWhen we note, with a gentle shudder, that the grafters of Naples,\r\ndefying even the mighty Augustus, leveled the \"White Earth Hill\" near\r\nPuteoli because an admixture of plaster paris is exceedingly\r\nprofitable to the milling profession....\r\n\r\nWhen Apicius--celebrated glutton--resorts to the comparatively\r\nharmless \"stunt\" of keeping fresh vegetables green by boiling them in\r\na copper kettle with soda....\r\n\r\nWhen we behold hordes of ancient legislators, posing as dervishes of\r\nmoderation, secretly and openly breaking the prohibition laws of their\r\nown making....\r\n\r\nWhen we turn away from such familiar sights and, in a more jovial\r\nmood, heartily laugh at the jokes of that former mill slave, Plautus\r\n(who could not pay his bills) and when we wonder why his wise cracks\r\nsound so familiar we remember that we have heard their modern versions\r\nonly yesterday at the Tivoli on State Street....\r\n\r\nWhen, finally, in the company of our respected Horatius we hear him\r\nsay in the slang of his day: _Ab ovo usque ad mala_, and compare this\r\nbright saying with our own dear \"From Soup to Nuts.\"...\r\n\r\nThen we arrive at the comforting conclusion that we moderns are either\r\nvery ancient and backward or that indeed the ancients are very modern\r\nand progressive; and it is our only regret that we cannot decide this\r\nperplexing situation to our lasting satisfaction.\r\n\r\nVery true, there may be nothing new under the sun, yet nature goes on\r\neternally fashioning new things from old materials. Eternally\r\ndemolishing old models in a manner of an economical sculptor, nature\r\nuses the same old clay to create new specimens. Sometimes nature\r\nslightly alters the patterns, discarding what is unfit for her\r\nmomentary enigmatic purposes, retaining and favoring that which\r\npleases her whimsical fancy for the time being.\r\n\r\nCookery deals exclusively with nature's works. Books on cookery are\r\nessentially books on nature's actions and reactions.\r\n\r\nIn the perpetual search for perfection, life has accomplished one\r\nremarkable thing: the development of man, the animal which cooks.\r\nGradually nature has revealed herself to man principally through the\r\nfood he takes, cooks and prepares for the enjoyment of himself and his\r\nfellow men.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COOKING ANIMAL\r\n\r\nThe gastronomer is the highest development of the cooking animal.\r\n\r\nHe--artist, philosopher, metaphysician, religionist--stands with his\r\nhead bared before nature: overawed, contemplating her gifts, feasting\r\nhis eyes on beauteous forms and colors, inhaling intoxicating\r\nfragrances, aromas, odors, matching them all artistically, partaking\r\nonly of what he needs for his own subsistence--eternally marveling at\r\nnature's inexhaustible resources and inventiveness, at her everlasting\r\nbounty born of everlasting fierce struggles.\r\n\r\nThe gastronomer is grateful for the privilege of holding the\r\ncustodianship of such precious things, and he guards it like an office\r\nof a sacred rite--ever gratefully, reverently adoring, cherishing the\r\nthings before him ... ever marveling ... ever alone, alone with\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAs for the overwhelming majority of the cooking animals, they behave\r\nmuch more \"naturally.\" They are a merry crowd, ever anticipating a\r\ngood time, ever jolly, eager, greedy. Or, they are cranky, hungry,\r\nstarved, miserable, and they turn savage now and then. Some are\r\ngluttonous. Many contract indigestion--nature's most subtle\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nIf they were told that they must kill before they may cook--that might\r\nspoil the appetite and dinner joy of many a tender-hearted devourer of\r\nfellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nHeaven forbid! Being real children of nature, and behaving naturally,\r\nnature likes them, and we, too, certainly are well pleased with the\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nThe only fly in the ointment of life is that we don't know what it is\r\nall about, and probably never will know.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRO{OE}MII FINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{Illustration: TRIPOD FOR THE GREAT CRATER\r\n\r\nHildesheim Treasure}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       THE RECIPES OF APICIUS\r\n                AND\r\n     THE EXCERPTS FROM APICIUS\r\n           BY VINIDARIUS\r\n\r\n ORIGINAL TRANSLATION FROM THE TEXTS\r\n  OF TORINUS, HUMELBERGIUS, LISTER\r\n       AND GIARRATANO-VOLLMER\r\n      WITH NOTES AND COMMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{Illustration: \"DINNER GONG\"\r\n\r\nHeavy bronze disk and substantial \"knocker\" to signal slaves.

INTO\r\nA COPPER BOWL PUT 6 SEXTARII [1] OF HONEY AND 2 SEXTARII OF WINE; HEAT\r\nON A SLOW FIRE, CONSTANTLY STIRRING THE MIXTURE WITH A WHIP. AT THE\r\nBOILING POINT ADD A DASH OF COLD WINE, RETIRE FROM STOVE AND SKIM.\r\nREPEAT THIS TWICE OR THREE TIMES, LET IT REST TILL THE NEXT DAY, AND\r\nSKIM AGAIN. THEN ADD 4 OZS. OF CRUSHED PEPPER [2], 3 SCRUPLES OF\r\nMASTICH, A DRACHM EACH OF [nard or laurel] LEAVES AND SAFFRON, 5\r\nDRACHMS OF ROASTED DATE STONES CRUSHED AND PREVIOUSLY SOAKED IN WINE\r\nTO SOFTEN THEM. WHEN THIS IS PROPERLY DONE ADD 18 SEXTARII OF LIGHT\r\nWINE. TO CLARIFY IT PERFECTLY, ADD [crushed] CHARCOAL [3] TWICE OR AS\r\nOFTEN AS NECESSARY WHICH WILL DRAW [the residue] TOGETHER [and\r\ncarefully strain or filter through the charcoal].\r\n\r\n    [1] _Sextarii._ Tor. _partes XV_; G.-V. _pondo XV_;\r\n    List. _partes XV ... pondo lib.... qui continent\r\n    sextarios sex_. One sextarius (a \"sixth\") equals about\r\n    1-1/2 pint English.\r\n\r\n    [2] Pepper. _Piperis uncias IV_--ordinarily our black or\r\n    white pepper grains, but in connection with honey,\r\n    sweets, and so forth, the term \"pepper\" may just as well\r\n    stand for our allspice, or even for any spicing in\r\n    general.\r\n\r\n    [3] Charcoal. Still a favorite filterer for liquors.\r\n\r\n    List. Apicius is correct in starting his book with this\r\n    formula, as all meals were started with this sort of\r\n    mixed drink.\r\n\r\n    Tor. deviates from the other texts in that he elaborates\r\n    on the cooking process.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] HONEY REFRESHER FOR TRAVELERS\r\n  _CONDITUM MELIZOMUM _[1]_ VIATORIUM_\r\n\r\nTHE WAYFARER'S HONEY REFRESHER (SO CALLED BECAUSE IT GIVES ENDURANCE\r\nAND STRENGTH TO PEDESTRIANS) [2] WITH WHICH TRAVELERS ARE REFRESHED BY\r\nTHE WAYSIDE IS MADE IN THIS MANNER: FLAVOR HONEY WITH GROUND PEPPER\r\nAND SKIM. IN THE MOMENT OF SERVING PUT HONEY IN A CUP, AS MUCH AS IS\r\nDESIRED TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT DEGREE OF SWEETNESS, AND MIX SPICED WINE\r\nNOT MORE THAN A NEEDED QUANTITY; ALSO ADD SOME WINE TO THE SPICED\r\nHONEY TO FACILITATE ITS FLOW AND THE MIXING.\r\n\r\n    [1] Tor. _Melirhomum_; _non extat_. G.-V. M.\r\n    _perpetuum_, i.e., having good keeping qualities.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tor. reads thus whereas others apply \"endurance\" to\r\n    the honey itself. The honey could not be preserved\r\n    (_perpetuum_) by the addition of pepper. Any addition,\r\n    as a matter of fact, would hasten its deterioration\r\n    unless the honey were boiled and sealed tight, which the\r\n    original takes for granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] ROMAN VERMOUTH\r\n  _ABSINTHIUM ROMANUM_ [1]\r\n\r\nROMAN VERMOUTH [or Absinth] IS MADE THUS: ACCORDING TO THE RECIPE OF\r\nCAMERINUM [2] YOU NEED WORMWOOD FROM SANTO [3] FOR ROMAN VERMOUTH OR,\r\nAS A SUBSTITUTE, WORMWOOD FROM THE PONTUS [4] CLEANED AND CRUSHED, 1\r\nTHEBAN OUNCE [5] OF IT, 6 SCRUPLES OF MASTICH, 3 EACH OF [nard]\r\nLEAVES, COSTMARY [6] AND SAFFRON AND 18 QUARTS OF ANY KIND OF MILD\r\nWINE. [Filter cold] CHARCOAL IS NOT REQUIRED BECAUSE OF THE\r\nBITTERNESS.\r\n\r\n    [1] G.-V. _Apsinthium_.\r\n\r\n    [2] The mention of a name in a recipe is very\r\n    infrequent. Camerinum is a town in Umbria.\r\n\r\n    [3] Now Saintonge, Southern France.\r\n\r\n    [4] Black Sea Region.\r\n\r\n    [5] Weight of indefinite volume, from Thebæ, one of the\r\n    several ancient cities by that name. List. thinks it is\r\n    an Egyptian ounce, and that the author of the recipe\r\n    must be an African.\r\n\r\n    [6] Wanting in Tor.; G.-V. _costi scripulos senos_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] ROSE WINE [1]\r\n  _ROSATUM_\r\n\r\nMAKE ROSE WINE IN THIS MANNER: ROSE PETALS, THE LOWER WHITE PART\r\nREMOVED, SEWED INTO A LINEN BAG AND IMMERSED IN WINE FOR SEVEN DAYS.\r\nTHEREUPON ADD A SACK OF NEW PETALS WHICH ALLOW TO DRAW FOR ANOTHER\r\nSEVEN DAYS. AGAIN REMOVE THE OLD PETALS AND REPLACE THEM BY FRESH ONES\r\nFOR ANOTHER WEEK; THEN STRAIN THE WINE THROUGH THE COLANDER. BEFORE\r\nSERVING, ADD HONEY SWEETENING TO TASTE. TAKE CARE THAT ONLY THE BEST\r\nPETALS FREE FROM DEW BE USED FOR SOAKING.\r\n\r\n    [1] Used principally as a laxative medicine. List. These\r\n    wines compounded of roses and violets move the bowels\r\n    strongly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] VIOLET WINE\r\n  _VIOLATIUM_\r\n\r\nIN A SIMILAR WAY AS ABOVE LIKE THE ROSE WINE VIOLET WINE IS MADE OF\r\nFRESH VIOLETS, AND TEMPERED WITH HONEY, AS DIRECTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] ROSE WINE WITHOUT [1] ROSES\r\n  _ROSATUM SINE ROSA_\r\n\r\nROSE WINE WITHOUT ROSES IS MADE IN THIS FASHION: A PALM LEAF BASKET\r\nFULL OF FRESH CITRUS LEAVES IS IMMERSED IN THE VAT OF NEW WINE BEFORE\r\nFERMENTATION HAS SET IN. AFTER FORTY DAYS RETIRE THE LEAVES, AND, AS\r\nOCCASION ARISES, SWEETEN THE WINE WITH HONEY, AND PASS IT UP FOR ROSE\r\nWINE.\r\n\r\n    [1] A substitute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] LIBURNIAN OIL\r\n  _OLEUM LIBURNICUM_\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO MAKE AN OIL SIMILAR TO THE LIBURNIAN OIL PROCEED AS\r\nFOLLOWS: IN SPANISH OIL PUT [the following mixture of] ELECAMPANE,\r\nCYPRIAN RUSH AND GREEN LAUREL LEAVES THAT ARE NOT TOO OLD, ALL OF IT\r\nCRUSHED AND MACERATED AND REDUCED TO A FINE POWDER. SIFT THIS IN AND\r\nADD FINELY GROUND SALT AND STIR INDUSTRIOUSLY FOR THREE DAYS OR MORE.\r\nTHEN ALLOW TO SETTLE. EVERYBODY WILL TAKE THIS FOR LIBURNIAN OIL. [1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Like the above a flagrant case of food adulteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] TO CLARIFY MUDDY WINE\r\n  _VINUM EX ATRO CANDIDUM FACIES_\r\n\r\nPUT BEAN MEAL AND THE WHITES OF THREE EGGS IN A MIXING BOWL. MIX\r\nTHOROUGHLY WITH A WHIP AND ADD TO THE WINE, STIRRING FOR A LONG TIME.\r\nTHE NEXT DAY THE WINE WILL BE CLEAR [1]. ASHES OF VINES HAVE THE SAME\r\nEFFECT.\r\n\r\n    [1] Ex Lister whose version we prefer. He says, _Alias\r\n    die erit candidum_ while Tor. adds white salt, saying,\r\n    _sal si adieceris candidum_, same as Tac. This is\r\n    unusual, although the ancients have at times treated\r\n    wine with sea water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\n[9] TO IMPROVE A BROTH [1]\r\n  _DE LIQUAMINE EMENDANDO_ [2]\r\n\r\nIF BROTH HAS CONTRACTED A BAD ODOR, PLACE A VESSEL UPSIDE DOWN AND\r\nFUMIGATE IT WITH LAUREL AND CYPRESS AND BEFORE VENTILATING [3] IT,\r\nPOUR THE BROTH IN THIS VESSEL. IF THIS DOES NOT HELP MATTERS [4] AND\r\nIF THE TASTE IS TOO PRONOUNCED, ADD HONEY AND FRESH SPIKENARD [5] TO\r\nIT; THAT WILL IMPROVE IT. ALSO NEW MUST SHOULD BE LIKEWISE EFFECTIVE\r\n[6].\r\n\r\n    [1] List. _Liquamen, id est, garum_. Goll. Fish sauce.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tor. _Qui liquamen corruptum corrigatur_.\r\n\r\n    [3] Dann.

Tor. is more correct\r\n    than the others, but this formula is beyond redemption.\r\n    Fate has decreed that ill-smelling broths shall be\r\n    discarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\n[10] TO KEEP MEATS FRESH WITHOUT SALT FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME\r\n   _UT CARNES SINE SALE QUOVIS TEMPORE RECENTES SINT_\r\n\r\nCOVER FRESH MEAT WITH HONEY, SUSPEND IT IN A VESSEL.

Method still popular today for pickling raw meats.\r\n    The originals treat of cooked meats (Tor. _nucula\r\n    elixa_; G.-V. _unguellæ coctæ_; Tac. _nucella cocta_).\r\n    Dispensing with the honey, we use more spices, whole\r\n    pepper, cloves, bay leaves, also onions and root\r\n    vegetables. Sometimes a little sugar and wine is added\r\n    to this preparation which the French call _marinade_ and\r\n    the Germans _Sauerbraten-Einlage_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n[12] TO MAKE SALT MEAT SWEET\r\n   _UT CARNEM SALSAM DULCEM FACIAS_\r\n\r\nYOU CAN MAKE SALT MEATS SWEET BY FIRST BOILING THEM IN MILK AND THEN\r\nFINISHING THEM IN WATER.\r\n\r\n    V.

List. _vas ab aceto_, which is correct. G.-V.\r\n    _lavas ab aceto_; V. the oysters? unthinkable! Besides\r\n    it would do no good.\r\n\r\n    [2] Goll. Take oysters out of the shell, place in\r\n    vinegar barrel, sprinkle with laurel berries, fine salt,\r\n    close tight. V. Goll's authority for this version is\r\n    not found in our originals.\r\n\r\n    V. There is no way to keep live oysters fresh except in\r\n    their natural habitat--salt water. Today we pack them in\r\n    barrels, feed them with oatmeal, put weights on them--of\r\n    no avail. The only way English oysters could have\r\n    arrived fresh in Imperial Rome was in specially\r\n    constructed bottoms of the galleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] MAKING A LITTLE LASER GO A LONG WAY\r\n   _UT NUCIA _[1]_ LASERIS TOTO TEMPORE UTARIS_\r\n\r\nPUT THE LASER [2] IN A SPACIOUS GLASS VESSEL; IMMERSE ABOUT 20 PINE\r\nKERNELS [pignolia nuts]\r\n\r\nIF YOU NEED LASER FLAVOR, TAKE SOME NUTS, CRUSH THEM; THEY WILL IMPART\r\nTO YOUR DISH AN ADMIRABLE FLAVOR. REPLACE THE USED NUTS WITH A LIKE\r\nNUMBER OF FRESH ONES [3]\r\n\r\n    [1] List. and G.-V. _uncia_--ounce. Making an ounce of\r\n    laser go a long way. Tor. _nucea_; Tac. _nucia_. Lister,\r\n    fond of hair-splitting, is irreconcilably opposed to\r\n    Tor., and berates Caspar Barthius for defending Tor.\r\n    List. _Quam futilis sit in multis labor C. Barthii ut\r\n    menda Torini passim sustineat, vel ex hoc loco\r\n    intelligere licet: Et enim lege modo uncia pro nucea cum\r\n    Humelbergio, & ista omnia glossemata vana sunt._\r\n\r\n    V. both readings, _uncia_ or _nucia_ are permissible,\r\n    and make very little difference. We side with Tor. and\r\n    Tac. because it takes more than an ounce of laser to\r\n    carry out this experiment.\r\n\r\n    [2] _Laser_, _laserpitium_, cf. dictionary.\r\n\r\n    [3] V. This article illustrates how sparingly the\r\n    ancients used the strong and pungent laser flavor [by\r\n    some believed to be _asa foetida_] because it was very\r\n    expensive, but principally because the Roman cooks\r\n    worked economically and knew how to treat spices and\r\n    flavors judiciously. This article alone should disperse\r\n    for all time all stories of ancient Rome's extravagance\r\n    in flavoring and seasoning dishes. It reminds of the\r\n    methods used by European cooks to get the utmost use out\r\n    of the expensive vanilla bean: they bury the bean in a\r\n    can of powdered sugar. They will use the sugar only\r\n    which has soon acquired a delicate vanilla perfume, and\r\n    will replace the used sugar by a fresh supply. This is\r\n    by far a superior method to using the often rank and\r\n    adulterated \"vanilla extract\" readily bottled. It is\r\n    more gastronomical and more economical. Most commercial\r\n    extracts are synthetic, some injurious. To believe that\r\n    any of them impart to the dishes the true flavor desired\r\n    is of course ridiculous. The enormous consumption of\r\n    such extracts however, is characteristic of our\r\n    industrialized barbarism which is so utterly indifferent\r\n    to the fine points in food. Today it is indeed hard for\r\n    the public to obtain a real vanilla bean.\r\n\r\n    Cf. also notes regarding flavoring to Nos. 276-7, 345\r\n    and 385.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\n[16] TO MAKE HONEY CAKES LAST\r\n   _UT DULCIA DE MELLE DIU DURENT_\r\n\r\nTO MAKE HONEY CAKES THAT WILL KEEP TAKE WHAT THE GREEKS CALL YEAST [1]\r\nAND MIX IT WITH THE FLOUR AND THE HONEY AT THE TIME WHEN MAKING THE\r\nCOOKY DOUGH.\r\n\r\n    [1] Tor. and Tac. _nechon_; G.-V. _cnecon_; Dann.\r\n    _penion_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[17] SPOILED HONEY MADE GOOD\r\n   _UT MEL MALUM BONUM FACIAS_\r\n\r\nHOW BAD HONEY MAY BE TURNED INTO A SALEABLE ARTICLE IS TO MIX ONE PART\r\nOF THE SPOILED HONEY WITH TWO PARTS OF GOOD HONEY.\r\n\r\n    List. _indigna fraus_!

Excellent idea, for the stems, if removed, would\r\n    leave a wound in the fruit for the air to penetrate and\r\n    to start fermentation. Cf. also the next formula.\r\n\r\n    [2] G.-V. _defritum_, from _defervitum_; _defrutum_ is\r\n    new wine, spiced, boiled down to one half of its volume.\r\n\r\n    [3] This precept would not keep the fruit very long\r\n    unless protected by a closefitting cover and\r\n    sterilization.

This and the foregoing formulæ illustrate the\r\n    ancients' attempts at preserving foods, and they betray\r\n    their ignorance of \"processing\" by heating them in\r\n    hermetically sealed vessels, the principle of which was\r\n    not discovered until 1810 by Appert which started the\r\n    now gigantic industry of canning.\r\n\r\n\r\n[25] TO KEEP POT HERBS\r\n   [_H_]_OLERA UT DIU SERVENTUR_\r\n\r\nPLACE SELECTED POT HERBS, NOT TOO MATURE, IN A PITCHED VESSEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[26] TO PRESERVE SORREL OR SOUR DOCK\r\n   _LAPÆ _[1]_ UT DIU SERVENTUR_\r\n\r\nTRIM AND CLEAN [the vegetable] PLACE THEM TOGETHER SPRINKLE MYRTLE\r\nBERRIES BETWEEN, COVER WITH HONEY AND VINEGAR.\r\n\r\nANOTHER WAY: PREPARE MUSTARD HONEY AND VINEGAR ALSO SALT AND COVER\r\nTHEM WITH THE SAME.\r\n\r\n    [1] The kind of vegetable to be treated here has not\r\n    been sufficiently identified.

Tor. explaining at\r\n    length: _conditura Rumicis quod lapathon Græci, Latini\r\n    Lapam quoque dicunt_.\r\n\r\n    V. Tor. is correct, or nearly so. Turnips, in the first\r\n    place, are not in need of any special method of\r\n    preservation. They keep very well in a cool,\r\n    well-ventilated place; in fact they would hardly keep\r\n    very long if treated in the above manner. These\r\n    directions are better applied to vegetables like dock or\r\n    monk's rhubarb. Lister, taking Humelbergii word for it,\r\n    accepts \"turnips\" as the only truth; but he has little\r\n    occasion to assail Torinus as he does: _Torinus lapam\r\n    legit, & nullibi temeritatem suam atque inscientiam\r\n    magis ostendit._\r\n\r\n    Now, if Torinus, according to Lister, \"nowhere displays\r\n    more nerve and ignorance\" we can well afford to trust\r\n    Torinus in cases such as this.\r\n\r\n\r\n[27] TO KEEP TRUFFLES\r\n   _TUBERA UT DIU SERVENTUR_\r\n\r\nTHE TRUFFLES WHICH MUST NOT BE TOUCHED BY WATER ARE PLACED ALTERNATELY\r\nIN DRY SAWDUST; SEAL THE VESSEL WITH PLASTER AND DEPOSIT IT IN A COOL\r\nPLACE.\r\n\r\n    Dann.

Either \"frying\" here stands for cooking,\r\n    stewing, braising, poaching, or else the so mysterious\r\n    _liquamen_ must here mean deep fat.

A\r\n    case where it is taken for granted that the shellfish is\r\n    boiled in water alive.

Gollmer makes the same mistake, believing\r\n    _spondyli_ to be identical with _spongioli_. He and\r\n    Danneil take _elixata_ for \"choice\" when this plainly\r\n    means \"cooked.\" If one were not sure of either word, the\r\n    nature of the subject would leave no room for any doubt.\r\n    Cf. note 1 to Nos. 115-121.\r\n\r\n    [2] We may find a reason for the combination of these\r\n    last three distinctly different formulæ into one article\r\n    in the following explanation. It is possible that these\r\n    dishes were served together as one course, even on one\r\n    platter, thus constituting a single dish, as it were.\r\n    Such a dish would strongly resemble platters of\r\n    \"_fritures_\" and \"_fritto misto_\" (mixed fried foods)\r\n    esteemed in France and Italy.

A combination of these\r\n    _isicia_ such as we here suggest would be entirely\r\n    feasible and would in fact make a dish of great\r\n    refinement, taxing the magiric artist's skill to the\r\n    utmost.

This\r\n    is found in the Torinus rendering.\r\n\r\n    His _lolæ floris_ should read _lolii_--from\r\n    _lolium_--darnel rye grass or ray grass which was\r\n    supposed to have intoxicating qualities, injurious to\r\n    the eye sight.--Ovid and Plautus. The seeds of this\r\n    grass were supposed to possess narcotic properties but\r\n    recent researches have cast doubt upon this theory.\r\n\r\n    A little butter, fresh cream and eggs are the proper\r\n    ingredients for chicken forcemeat. Any kind of flour for\r\n    binding the forcemeat would cheapen the dish. Yet some\r\n    modern forcemeats (sausage) contain as much as fifty\r\n    percent of some kind of meal. The most effective is that\r\n    of the soya bean which is not starchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[51] CHICKEN BROTH ANOTHER STYLE\r\n   _ALITER DE PULLO_\r\n\r\nCHICKEN MEAT, 31 PEPPERCORNS CRUSHED, 1 CHOENIX [1] FULL OF THE VERY\r\nBEST STOCK, A LIKE AMOUNT OF BOILED MUST AND ELEVEN MEASURES [2] OF\r\nWATER.

We would leave the honey out, make a cream sauce\r\n    from the stock, or, adding bouillon, tie same with a\r\n    little flour and butter, and would call the dish Stewed\r\n    Celery and Leeks. The ancient method is entirely\r\n    rational because the mineral salts of the vegetables are\r\n    preserved and utilized (invariably observed by Apicius)\r\n    which today are often wasted by inexperienced cooks who\r\n    discard these precious elements with the water in which\r\n    vegetables are boiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n[72] ASPARAGUS\r\n   _ASPARAGOS_\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS [Tor.

Must be dried before boiling because the cold\r\n    water clinging to the stalks is likely to chill the\r\n    boiling water too much in which the asparagus is to be\r\n    cooked. Apicius here reveals himself as the consummate\r\n    cook who is familiar with the finest detail of physical\r\n    and chemical changes which food undergoes at varying\r\n    temperatures.\r\n\r\n    The various editions all agree: _asparagos siccabis_;\r\n    Schuch, however, says: \"For the insane _siccabis_ I\r\n    substitute _siciabis_, _isiciabis_, prepare with _sicio_\r\n    [?] and cook.\" He even goes on to interpret it _cucabis_\r\n    from the Greek _kouki_, cocoanut milk, and infers that\r\n    the asparagus was first cooked in cocoanut milk and then\r\n    put back into water, a method we are tempted to\r\n    pronounce insane.\r\n\r\n    [2] V. Backwards! G.-V. _rursum in calidam_; Tac.\r\n    _rursus in aquam calidam_; Tor. _ac rursus ..._\r\n\r\n    This word has caused us some reflection, but the ensuing\r\n    discovery made it worth while. _Rursus_ has escaped the\r\n    attention of the other commentators. In this case\r\n    _rursus_ means backwards, being a contraction from\r\n    _revorsum_, h.e. _reversum_. The word is important\r\n    enough to be observed.\r\n\r\n    Apicius evidently has the right way of cooking the fine\r\n    asparagus. The stalks, after being peeled and washed\r\n    must be bunched together and tied according to sizes,\r\n    and the bunches must be set into the boiling water\r\n    \"backwards,\" that is, they must stand upright with the\r\n    heads protruding from the water. The heads will be made\r\n    tender above the water line by rising steam and will be\r\n    done simultaneously with the harder parts of the stalks.\r\n    We admit, we have never seen a modern cook observe this\r\n    method. They usually boil the tender heads to death\r\n    while the lower stalks are still hard.\r\n\r\n    Though this formula is incomplete (it fails to state the\r\n    sauce to be served, also that the asparagus must be\r\n    peeled and bunched, that the water must contain salt,\r\n    etc.) it is one of the neatest formulæ in Apicius. It is\r\n    amusing to note how the author herein unconsciously\r\n    reveals what a poor litérateur but what a fine cook he\r\n    is. This is characteristic of most good practitioners.\r\n    One may perfectly master the vast subject of cookery,\r\n    yet one may not be able to give a definition of even a\r\n    single term, let alone the ability to exactly describe\r\n    one of the many processes of cookery. Real poets often\r\n    are in the same predicament; none of them ever explained\r\n    the art satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n    [3] G.-V. add to the formula _callosiores reddes_--give\r\n    back [eliminate] the harder ones. This sentence belongs\r\n    to the next article. And Torinus, similar to\r\n    Humelbergius, renders this sentence _ut reddas ad gustum\r\n    calliores_--to render the harder ones palatable--the\r\n    squash and pumpkin namely--and we are inclined to agree\r\n    with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n[73] PUMPKIN, SQUASH\r\n   _CUCURBITAS_\r\n\r\nTO HAVE THE HARDER ONES PALATABLE, DO THIS: [1] [Cut the fruit into\r\npieces, boil and] SQUEEZE THE WATER OUT OF THE BOILED FRUIT AND\r\nARRANGE [the pieces] IN A BAKING DISH.

Note the almost scientific\r\n    procedure: the stalks are separated from the leaves,\r\n    split to facilitate cooking; they are cooked separately\r\n    because they require more time than the tender greens.\r\n\r\n    Our present method appears barbarous in comparison. We\r\n    quarter the cabbage head, and either boil it or steam\r\n    it. As a result either the tender leaves are cooked to\r\n    death or the stems are still hard. The overcooked parts\r\n    are not palatable, the underdone ones indigestible.

The French today\r\n    have a delicious dish, _Choux de Bruxelles aux\r\n    Marrons_--Brussels Sprouts with Chestnuts. Sprouts and\r\n    chestnuts are, of course, cooked separately; the lightly\r\n    boiled sprouts are _sauté_ in butter; the chestnuts\r\n    parboiled, peeled, and finished in stock with a little\r\n    sugar or syrup, tossed in butter and served in the\r\n    center of the sprouts.\r\n\r\n    The Apician formula with cereal and raisins added is too\r\n    exotic to suit our modern taste, but without a question\r\n    is a nutritious dish and complete from a dietetic point\r\n    of view.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tor. _Superasperges_; G.-V. _piper asperges_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\n[93] LEEKS\r\n   _PORROS_\r\n\r\nWELL MATURED LEEKS [1] ARE BOILED WITH A PINCH OF SALT [2] IN\r\n[combined] WATER AND OIL [3].

Another way to read this: _baca et fabæ_--with\r\n    beans--is quite within reason.

Moreover, the\r\n    mode of preparation fits beets nicely, except for the\r\n    flour to which we object in note 3, below. To cook beets\r\n    with leeks, spices and wine and serve them (cold) with\r\n    oil and vinegar is indeed a method that cannot be\r\n    improved upon.\r\n\r\n    [3] Tac., Tor., List., G.-V. _uvam passam_,\r\n    _Farinam_--raisins and flour--for which there is no\r\n    reason.

Torinus, who in his preface complains that\r\n    his authority has no punctuation whatsoever and thereby\r\n    indicates that it must have been a very ancient copy,\r\n    (at least prior to the 1503 Tac. ed.) is generally not\r\n    far from the mark.

He reads: _De\r\n    thoris accipies rosas_, but List. insists that _de\r\n    thoris_ be read _de rosis_; Lan., Tac. _de toris_; V.\r\n    _de thoris_ may be read \"fresh from the flower bed.\"\r\n\r\n    Cf. {Rx} Nos. 167 and 171 in which case the \"rose\" may\r\n    stand for rosy apple, or \"Roman Beauty\" apple. \"Rose\r\n    apple\" also is a small pimento, size of a plum.\r\n\r\n\r\n[137] PUMPKIN PIE\r\n    _PATINA DE CUCURBITIS_ [1]\r\n\r\nAND PUMPKIN PIE IS MADE THUS [2] STEWED AND MASHED PUMPKIN IS PLACED\r\nIN THE PAN [or pie dish] SEASONED WITH A LITTLE CUMIN ESSENCE.

Wanting in other texts.\r\n\r\n    [3] Modern English recipes for stewed pumpkin resemble\r\n    this Apician precept, but America has made a really\r\n    palatable dish from pumpkin by the addition of eggs,\r\n    cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger--spices which the insipid\r\n    pumpkin needs. The ancient original may have omitted the\r\n    eggs because Apicius probably expected his formula to be\r\n    carried out in accordance with the preceding formulæ.\r\n    Perhaps this is proven by the fact that Tor. continues\r\n    the Rose Pie recipe with _et cucurbita patina sic fiet_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[138] SPRATS OR SMELTS AU VIN BLANC\r\n    _PATINA DE APUA_ [1]\r\n\r\nCLEAN THE SMELTS [or other small fish, filets of sole, etc. of white\r\nmeat] MARINATE [i.e. impregnate with] IN OIL, PLACE IN A SHALLOW PAN,\r\nADD OIL, BROTH [2] AND WINE.

He omitted to say that the fish, when cooked,\r\n    was placed on the service platter and that the juices\r\n    remaining in the sauce pan were tied with one or two egg\r\n    yolks, diluted with cream, or wine, or _court bouillon_,\r\n    strained and poured over the fish at the moment of\r\n    serving. This is perhaps the best method of preparing\r\n    fish with white meat of a fine texture. Pink or darker\r\n    fish do not lend themselves to this method of\r\n    preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[139] SMELT PIE, OR, SPRAT CUSTARD\r\n    _PATINA DE ABUA SIVE APUA_ [1]\r\n\r\nBONELESS PIECES OF ANCHOVIES OR [other small] FISH, EITHER ROAST\r\n[fried] BOILED, CHOP VERY FINE. FILL A CASSEROLE GENEROUSLY WITH THE\r\nSAME [season with] CRUSHED PEPPER AND A LITTLE RUE, ADD SUFFICIENT\r\nBROTH AND SOME OIL, AND MIX IN, ALSO ADD ENOUGH RAW EGGS SO THAT THE\r\nWHOLE FORMS ONE SOLID MASS. NOW CAREFULLY ADD SOME SEA-NETTLES BUT\r\nTAKE PAIN THAT THEY ARE NOT MIXED WITH THE EGGS. NOW PUT THE DISH INTO\r\nTHE STEAM SO THAT IT MAY CONGEAL [but avoid boiling] [2]. WHEN DONE\r\nSPRINKLE WITH GROUND PEPPER AND CARRY INTO THE DINING ROOM. NOBODY\r\nWILL BE ABLE TO TELL WHAT HE IS ENJOYING [3].\r\n\r\n    [1] Tac., Tor. _sic_. List., G.-V. _p. de apua sine\r\n    apua_--a dish of anchovies (or smelts) without\r\n    anchovies. Tor. formula bears the title _patina de\r\n    apua_, and his article opens with the following\r\n    sentence: _patin de abua sive apua sic facies_. He is\r\n    therefore quite emphatic that the dish is to be made\r\n    with the _abua_ or _apua_ (an anchovy) and not without\r\n    _apua_, as List. has it. Lan. calls the dish: P. _de\r\n    apabadiade_, not identified.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tor. _impones ad uaporem ut cum ouis meare\r\n    possint_--warning, get along with the eggs, i.e. beware\r\n    of boiling them for they will curdle, and the experiment\r\n    is hopelessly lost. List. however, reads _meare possint_\r\n    thus: _bullire p._--boil (!) It is quite plain that Tor.\r\n    has the correct formula.\r\n\r\n    [3] _et ex esu nemo agnoscet quid manducet._ Dann.\r\n    renders this sentence thus: \"Nobody can value this dish\r\n    unless he has partaken of it himself.\" He is too\r\n    lenient. We would rather translate it literally as we\r\n    did above, or say broadly, \"And nobody will be any the\r\n    wiser.\" List. dwells at length upon this sentence; his\r\n    erudite commentary upon the _cena dubia_, the doubtful\r\n    meal, will be found under the heading of _cena_ in our\r\n    vocabulary. List. pp. 126-7. List. undoubtedly made the\r\n    mistake of reading _sine_ for _sive_. He therefore\r\n    omitted the _apua_ from his formula. The above boastful\r\n    sentence may have induced him to do so.\r\n\r\n    The above is a fish forcemeat, now seldom used as an\r\n    integral dish, but still popular as a dressing for fish\r\n    or as quenelles. The modern fish forcemeat is usually\r\n    made of raw fish, cream and eggs, with the necessary\r\n    seasoning. The material is poached or cooked much in the\r\n    same manner as prescribed by the ancient recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[140] A RICH ENTRÉE OF FISH, POULTRY AND SAUSAGE IN CREAM\r\n    _PATINA EX LACTE_\r\n\r\nSOAK [pignolia] NUTS, DRY THEM, AND ALSO HAVE FRESH SEA-URCHINS [1]\r\nREADY.

For \"pepper\"\r\n    nutmeg or allspice may be substituted, as is used today\r\n    in such preparations. The oil seems superfluous, but it\r\n    is taking the place of our butter.

The ancients called the sturgeon\r\n    _acipenser_; but this name was gradually changed into\r\n    _styrio_, _stirio_ and _sturio_, which is similar to\r\n    _tursio_ (cf. _styrio_ in the vocabulary). The fish in\r\n    question therefore may have been sturgeon for which the\r\n    Black Sea is famous.\r\n\r\n    [4] List., G.-V. _ovis obligabis_--tie with\r\n    eggs--certainly preferable to the Tor. version.\r\n\r\n    [5] Tor. thyme.\r\n\r\n    The above is an excellent way of making fish balls, it\r\n    being taken for granted, of course, that the salt fish\r\n    be thoroughly soaked and cooked in milk before shaping\r\n    into balls. The many spices should be used very\r\n    moderately, some to be omitted entirely. We read between\r\n    the lines of the old formula that the _Tursio_ had a\r\n    long journey from Pontus to Rome; fish however dry\r\n    acquires a notorious flavor upon such journeys which\r\n    must be offset by herbs and spices.\r\n\r\n    It is quite possible that the ancients made a\r\n    _réduction_ of the herbs and spices mentioned in this\r\n    formula; in fact, the presence of vinegar leads us to\r\n    believe this, in which case this formula would be\r\n    nothing but a very modern sauce. The herbs and spices in\r\n    a _réduction_ are crushed and boiled down in vinegar and\r\n    wine, and strained off, they leave their finest flavor\r\n    in the sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n[146] VEGETABLE DINNER\r\n    _PATELLA EX OLISATRO_ [1]\r\n\r\n[Any kind of vegetables or herbs] BLANCHED OFF IN WATER WITH [a\r\nlittle] SODA; SQUEEZE [out the water] ARRANGE IN A SAUCEPAN.

G.-V. _patellam ex\r\n    holisatro_.\r\n\r\n    [2] It is worth noting that Tor. and Tac. omit this\r\n    recipe entirely and that Tor. concludes the preceding\r\n    formula with the last sentence of the above formula,\r\n    except for the difference in one word. Tor. _et de\r\n    quacunque libra_ [List. _et al._ _herba_] _si volueris\r\n    facies ut demonstratum est suprà_. This might mean that\r\n    it is optional (in the preceding formula) to shape the\r\n    fish into one pound loaves instead of the small fish\r\n    balls, which is often done in the case of forcemeats, as\r\n    in veal, beef, ham loaves, or fish pie.\r\n\r\n    We are inclined to accept the reading of Torinus, for\r\n    the above way of preparing \"any kind of vegetables or\r\n    herbs\" is somewhat farfetched. Furthermore, the\r\n    vegetable dish would more properly belong in Book III.\r\n\r\n    Just another example of where readings by various\r\n    editors are different because of the interpretations of\r\n    one word. In this case one group reads _libra_ whereas\r\n    the other reads _herba_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[147] A DISH OF SARDINES\r\n    _PATELLA DE APUA_ [1]\r\n\r\nSARDINE LOAF (OR OMELETTE) IS MADE IN THIS MANNER [2] CLEAN THE\r\nSARDINES [of skin and bones]; BREAK [and beat] EGGS AND MIX WITH [half\r\nof the] FISH [3]; ADD TO THIS SOME STOCK, WINE AND OIL, AND FINISH\r\n[the composition] BY HEATING IT.

We have no\r\n    knowledge of the ancient _apua fricta_ other than our\r\n    making of modern sardines which is to fry them in oil as\r\n    quickly as possible after the fish has left the water,\r\n    for its meat is very delicate. For an omelette, our\r\n    modern sardines, including kippered smelts, sprotten,\r\n    and similar smoked and processed fish, contain\r\n    sufficient salt and fat to season the eggs of an\r\n    omelette.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tor. Sentence wanting in other texts.\r\n\r\n    [3] Tor. _cum aqua_; List., G.-V. _cum apua_. Perhaps a\r\n    typographical error in Tor.

This work stands for salt pork, from\r\n    _laridum_ and _lardum_ (French, _lard_; the English\r\n    _lard_ is applied to the rendered fat of pork in\r\n    general). Cf. notes to {Rx} No. 41.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.\r\n\r\n    [3] _oua dura_; Sch. _o. dua_--two eggs.\r\n\r\n    [4] This formula would be intelligible and even\r\n    gastronomically correct were it not for this word\r\n    \"fish.\" However, we cannot accept Lister's reading\r\n    _lacertis_. We prefer the reading, _laridis_, bacon. The\r\n    French have another term for this--_petits salés_. Both\r\n    this and the Torinus term are in the plural. They are\r\n    simply small strips of bacon to which Torinus again\r\n    refers in the above formula, _salsum, coctum in media\r\n    pones_--put the bacon, when done, in the center (of the\r\n    dish). Regarding _salsum_ also see note to {Rx} No. 41.\r\n\r\n    The above dish resembles _ragoût fin en coquille_, a\r\n    popular Continental dish, although its principal\r\n    ingredients are sweetbreads instead of brains.\r\n\r\n\r\n[149] BROILED MULLET\r\n    _PATINA EX PISCIBUS MULLIS_ [1]\r\n\r\nA DISH OF MULLET CONSISTS OF [2] SCALED SALT MULLET PLACED IN A CLEAN\r\nPAN WITH ENOUGH OIL [3] AS IS NECESSARY FOR COOKING; WHEN DONE ADD [a\r\ndash of honey-] WINE OR RAISIN WINE, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.\r\n\r\n    [1] List., G.-V. _mullorum loco salsi_--salt mullet.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tor. wanting in other texts.\r\n\r\n    [3] List. _liquamen_--broth, brine, which would be worse\r\n    than carrying owls to Athens.

The fish, if such was used, was probably\r\n    first poached in the broth, wine and oil, and when done,\r\n    removed from the pan.

This operation is said to have been\r\n    first performed by a Roman surgeon with the intention of\r\n    beating the _Lex Fannia_, or Fannian law, sponsored by a\r\n    fanatic named Fannius. It prohibited among other\r\n    restrictions the serving of any fowl at any time or\r\n    repast except a hen, and this hen was not to be\r\n    fattened. Note the cunning of the law: The useful hen\r\n    and her unlaid eggs could be sacrificed while the\r\n    unproductive rooster was allowed to thrive to no\r\n    purpose, immune from the butcher's block. This set the\r\n    shrewd surgeon to thinking; he transformed a rooster\r\n    into a capon by his surgical trick. The emasculated bird\r\n    grew fat without his owner committing any infraction of\r\n    the Roman law against fattening chickens. Of course the\r\n    capon, being neither hen nor rooster, was perfectly safe\r\n    to eat, for he was within the law. Thus he became a huge\r\n    success as an ancient \"bootleg\" chicken.\r\n\r\n    [4] These integral parts must be prepared and poached\r\n    separately and merely heated together before the final\r\n    service.\r\n\r\n    [5] Again the Plautian colloquialism _ius de suo sibi_.\r\n\r\n    [6] This dish is worthy of Apicius. It is akin to our\r\n    _Ragoût Financière_, and could pass for _Vol-au-vent à\r\n    la Financière_ if it were served in a large fluffy crust\r\n    of puff paste.\r\n\r\n\r\n[167] MINUTAL À LA MATIUS [1]\r\n    _MINUTAL MATIANUM_\r\n\r\nPUT IN A SAUCE PAN OIL, BROTH FINELY CHOPPED LEEKS, CORIANDER, SMALL\r\nTID-BITS, COOKED PORK SHOULDER, CUT INTO LONG STRIPS INCLUDING THE\r\nSKIN, HAVE EVERYTHING EQUALLY HALF DONE.

It was already lost\r\n    during Varro's days.\r\n\r\n    [2] Cf. note 1, above.

We would here interpret it as the frying of the\r\n    leeks in oil, etc. In another instance _coctura_ may\r\n    mean our modern _réduction_.\r\n\r\n    [3] The fruit to be used here has not been\r\n    satisfactorily identified. The texts have _citrium_ and\r\n    _citrum_--a sweet squash or cucumber--perhaps even a\r\n    melon, but not the citron, the _mala citrea_ as read by\r\n    List. This specimen is hard to identify because of the\r\n    many varieties in the cucumber, squash and the citrus\r\n    families. _Citrus_, as a matter of fact, is but a\r\n    corruption of _cedrus_, the cedar tree.\r\n\r\n    We are not sure whether this fruit is to be stuffed with\r\n    the ragout and then baked, as is often the custom to do\r\n    with such shells; the texts prescribes distinctly to\r\n    hollow out the fruit.\r\n\r\n    The title, implying a \"sweet dish\" is obviously wrong.\r\n\r\n    It may be remarked here that Apicius makes no mention of\r\n    that marvelous citrus fruit, the lemon, nor of the\r\n    orange, both of which are indispensable to modern\r\n    cookery.\r\n\r\n\r\n[169] MINUTAL OF FRUIT\r\n    _MINUTAL EX PRÆCOQUIS_\r\n\r\nIN A SAUCE PAN PUT OIL, BROTH AND WINE, FINELY CUT SHALLOTS, DICED\r\nCOOKED PORK SHOULDER.

Cf. {Rx} Nos. 136 and 167.\r\n\r\n    The above title has led to the belief that the ancients\r\n    made pies, etc., of roses, an idea that was much\r\n    ridiculed in England after the publication of Lister's\r\n    work in 1705.\r\n\r\n    We concur with Schuch's interpretation that rosy apples\r\n    were used, remembering, however, that the fruit of the\r\n    rose tree, the hip, dog-briar, eglantine is also made\r\n    into dainty confections on the Continent today. It is\r\n    therefore entirely possible that this recipe calls for\r\n    the fruit of the rose tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nGRUELS\r\n  _TISANAM VEL SUCUM_\r\n\r\n\r\n[172] BARLEY BROTH, PAP, PORRIDGE, GRUEL\r\n    _TISANA SIVE CREMORE_ [1]\r\n\r\nCRUSH BARLEY, SOAKED THE DAY BEFORE, WELL WASHED, PLACE ON THE FIRE\r\nTO BE COOKED [in a double boiler] WHEN HOT ADD ENOUGH OIL, A BUNCH OF\r\nDILL, DRY ONION, SATURY AND COLOCASIUM [2] TO BE COOKED TOGETHER\r\nBECAUSE FOR THE BETTER JUICE, ADD GREEN CORIANDER AND A LITTLE SALT;\r\nBRING IT TO A BOILING POINT.

The use of early and unripe fruit for this and\r\n    similar purposes is excellent. The above formula is a\r\n    good example of our own \"spiced\" peaches, pears, etc.,\r\n    usually taken as a relish. Of course, we use sugar\r\n    instead of honey for sweetening, and brandy instead of\r\n    wine; but the underlying principles are alike.\r\n\r\n    This is a good illustration of and speaks well for the\r\n    economy and the ingenuity of the ancients.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF BOOK IV\r\n\r\n_EXPLICIT APICII PANDECTER, LIBER QUARTUS_ [Tac.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{Illustration: ROUND TABLE\r\n\r\nClaw-footed bronze legs on triangular base, consisting of three molded\r\ncylindrical supports, connected by cross-bars.

It was\r\n    also used at sacrifices. The _pultes_ and _pulticulæ_\r\n    given by Apicius are illustrations of the ever-present\r\n    desire to improve--to glorify, as it were, a thing which\r\n    once was or still is of vital importance in the daily\r\n    life of humans. The _nouveaux-riches_ of the ancient and\r\n    the modern world cannot find it easy to separate\r\n    themselves from their traditions nor are they wont to\r\n    put up with their plainness, hence the fancy trimmings.\r\n    The development of the American pie is a curious analogy\r\n    in this respect. We see in this the intricate working of\r\n    human culture, its eternal strife for perfection. And\r\n    perfection is synonymous with decay. The fare of the\r\n    Carthusian monks, professed, stern vegetarians,\r\n    underwent the same tortuous evolution.\r\n\r\n    [3] Named for Didius Julianus, the emperor who was a\r\n    vegetarian. Of course, his majesty could not live on a\r\n    plain porridge, hence the Apician artistry. The _pultes_\r\n    were popular with the many professed vegetarians though\r\n    the obliging cooks mixed finely ground meat in this and\r\n    other porridges.\r\n\r\n    Our various cream soups and legume purées--those most\r\n    salubrious creations of modern cookery are no doubt\r\n    lineal descendants from the Apician _pultes_. They are\r\n    so scarce comparatively because they require all the\r\n    ingenuity and resourcefulness of a gifted cook to be\r\n    perfect.\r\n\r\n    [4] Dann. remarks that this formula is wanting in List.\r\n    Both Lister's first and second editions have it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[179] GRUEL AND WINE\r\n    _PULTES {OE}NOCOCTI_\r\n\r\nPORRIDGE AND WINE IS THUS MADE: [1] FLAVOR THE PULSE WELL WITH WINE\r\n[2] AND IMMERSE IN THE JUICE DAINTY MORSELS [3].\r\n\r\n    [1] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tor. _Oenogari_; G.-V. _Oenococti_.\r\n\r\n    [3] Tor. _cupedias_; _copadia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[180] SIMILAR\r\n    _SIMILAM_ [1]\r\n\r\nOR FLAVOR COOKED SPELT WITH THE LIQUOR OF DAINTY PIECES OF PORK, OR\r\nCAPON [2] COOKED IN WINE [3].\r\n\r\n    [1] Tac. _inulam_; Tor. _mulam_--misreading.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tor.; List. _apponis_.\r\n\r\n    [3] For practical reasons we have separated the text of\r\n    {Rx} Nos. 179 and 180 which appears as one in the texts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[181] MILK TOAST\r\n    _PULTES TRACTOGALATÆ_ [1]\r\n\r\nPUT A PINT OF MILK AND SOME WATER ON THE FIRE IN A NEW [clean] POT;\r\nBREAK ROUND BREAD INTO IT [2] DRY, STIR WELL TO PREVENT BURNING; ADD\r\nWATER AS NECESSARY [3].\r\n\r\n    [1] Tor. _pulticula tractogala_.\r\n\r\n    [2] List. _tres orbiculos tractæ_; Tor. _teres\r\n    sorbiculos tractæ_.\r\n\r\n    _Tractum_ is a piece of pastry, a round bread or roll in\r\n    this case, stale, best suited for this purpose.\r\n\r\n    [3] The text continues without interruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n[182] HONEY PAP\r\n    _SIMILITER_\r\n\r\nHONEY AND MEAD ARE TREATED SIMILARLY, MIXED WITH MILK, WITH THE\r\nADDITION OF SALT AND A LITTLE OIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[178-183] PULSE\r\n        _PULTES_ [1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Tor. _Alia pulticula_.\r\n\r\n    This is a verbatim repetition of {Rx} No. 178.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLENTILS\r\n  _LENTICULA_ [1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[183] LENTILS AND COW-PARSNIPS\r\n    _LENTICULA EX SPONDYLIS SIVE FONDYLIS_ [2]\r\n\r\nPUT THE LENTILS IN A CLEAN SAUCE PAN [and cook with salt].

Which is a very delectable way of preparing the\r\n    tender pea. Some of its refreshing green color is\r\n    sacrificed by this process, but this loss is amply\r\n    offset by the savour of the dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n[186] PEAS [supreme style]\r\n    _PISA FARSILIS_ [1]\r\n\r\nCOOK THE PEAS WITH OIL AND A PIECE OF SOW'S BELLY [2] PUT IN A SAUCE\r\nPAN BROTH, LEEK HEADS [the lower white part] GREEN CORIANDER AND PUT\r\nON THE FIRE TO BE COOKED.

Caul is the abdominal membrane.\r\n\r\n    [6] _petasonis pulpas_; Dann. ham, which is not quite\r\n    correct. The _petaso_ is the shoulder part of pork,\r\n    either cured or fresh, generally fresh. The cooked pork\r\n    shoulder here is cut into small pieces. Nothing is said\r\n    about the utilization of the sow's belly mentioned at\r\n    the opening of the formula. We assume that the _petaso_\r\n    can take its place in the dish.\r\n\r\n    [7] There is nothing just like this dish in the history\r\n    of gastronomy, considering both the comparatively cheap\r\n    materials and the refinement of the gastronomic idea\r\n    which it embodies. The _chartreuses_ of Carême are the\r\n    nearest thing to it. Lister waxes enthusiastic about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[187] INDIAN PEAS\r\n    _PISAM INDICAM_ [1]\r\n\r\nCOOK PEAS; WHEN SKIMMED, PUT IN THE SAUCE PAN FINELY CHOPPED LEEKS AND\r\nCORIANDER TO BE COOKED [with the peas].

WHEN DONE, CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, A LITTLE WILD CUMIN\r\n[2] MOISTEN WITH THE JUICE [of the peas] ADD WINE AND RAISIN WINE TO\r\nTASTE; MINCE THE FISH VERY FINE, INCORPORATE IT WITH THE PEAS, AND\r\nSPRINKLE WITH PEPPER [3].\r\n\r\n    [1] Tor. _pisum Indicum_.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tor., Tac. _casei modicum_; other texts, _carei_.\r\n\r\n    [3] The texts continues without interruption to the next\r\n    formula.\r\n\r\n\r\n[188] ANOTHER WAY\r\n    _ALITER_\r\n\r\nCOOK THE PEAS, WORK WELL [to make a purée] PLACE IN THE COLD, STIRRING\r\nUNTIL THEY HAVE COOLED OFF. FINELY CHOP ONIONS AND THE WHITES OF HARD\r\nBOILED EGGS, SEASON WITH SALT AND A LITTLE VINEGAR; THE YOLKS PRESS\r\nTHROUGH A COLANDER INTO AN ENTRÉE DISH, SEASON WITH FRESH OIL AND\r\nSERVE [1].\r\n\r\n    [1] The texts fail to state that the whites, yolks,\r\n    onions, vinegar and oil must eventually be combined into\r\n    a dressing very similar to our own modern _vinaigrette_;\r\n    for decorative and other gastronomic reasons the\r\n    separate treatment of the whites and the yolks is both\r\n    ingenious and excellent, and is very often practised in\r\n    good kitchens today.\r\n\r\n\r\n[189] PEAS OR BEANS À LA VITELLIUS\r\n    _PISAM VITELLIANAM SIVE FABAM_ [1]\r\n\r\nPEAS OR BEANS WITH YOLKS ARE MADE THUS: [2] COOK THE PEAS, SMOOTHEN\r\n[3] THEM; CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, GINGER, AND ON THE CONDIMENTS PUT HARD\r\nBOILED YOLKS, 3 OUNCES OF HONEY, ALSO BROTH, WINE AND VINEGAR; [mix\r\nand] PLACE ALL IN A SAUCE PAN; THE FINELY CHOPPED CONDIMENTS WITH OIL\r\nADDED, PUT ON THE STOVE TO BE COOKED; WITH THIS FLAVOR THE PEAS WHICH\r\nMUST BE SMOOTH; AND IF THEY BE TOO HARSH [in taste] ADD HONEY AND\r\nSERVE [4].\r\n\r\n    [1] List. _Pisa Vitelliana_--named for Vitellius, ninth\r\n    Roman emperor, notorious glutton, according to Hum. who\r\n    says that V. invented this dish: _ab auctore Vitellio\r\n    Imperatore luxui deditissimo_. But Tor. differs; his\r\n    _pisum uitellinum_ stands for peas with\r\n    yolks--_vitellum_--yolk, (also calf) dim. _vitellinum_;\r\n    Tac. _v----am_. Cf. {Rx} No. 193.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.\r\n\r\n    [3] _lias_--to make a purée by crushing and straining.\r\n    Tor. _lævigabis_, from _levigo_--meaning the same.\r\n\r\n    [4] If Vitellius never invented any other dish than this\r\n    one, his gluttony was overrated. As a gastronomer he may\r\n    be safely relegated to the vast multitude of ill-advised\r\n    people whose craving for carbohydrates (which is perhaps\r\n    pathological) causes them to accumulate a surplus of\r\n    fat. This was fatal to Vitellius and his faithful court\r\n    baker who is said to have stuck to his master to the\r\n    last. The poor emperor's _embonpoint_ proved cumbersome\r\n    when he fled the infuriated mob. Had he been leaner he\r\n    might have effected a \"getaway.\" He was dragged through\r\n    the streets and murdered, Dec. 21 or 22, A.D. 69.\r\n\r\n\r\n[190] ANOTHER WAY\r\n    _ALITER PISAM SIVE FABAM_\r\n\r\nWHEN [the peas or beans are] SKIMMED MIX BROTH, HONEY, MUST, CUMIN,\r\nRUE, CELERY SEED, OIL AND WINE, STIR [1].

To prove that Apicius is\r\n    not dead \"by a long shot,\" we shall quote from Wolf,\r\n    Rebekka: Kochbuch für Israelitische Frauen, Frankfurt,\r\n    1896, 11th edition. As a matter of fact, Rebekka Wolf is\r\n    outdoing Apicius in strangeness--a case of _Apicium in\r\n    ipso Apicio_, as Lister sarcastically remarks of\r\n    Torinus.\r\n\r\n    Rebekka Wolf: {Rx} No. 211--wash and boil the young\r\n    beans in fat _bouillon_ (Apicius: _oleum et liquamen_)\r\n    adding a handful of chopped pepperwort (A.: _piper,\r\n    ligusticum_) and later chopped parsley (A.:\r\n    _petroselinum_) some sugar (A.: _mel pavo_--little\r\n    honey) and pepper. Beans later in the season are cooked\r\n    with potatoes. The young beans are tied with flour\r\n    dissolved in water, or with roux.\r\n\r\n    _Id. ibid._, {Rx} No. 212, Beans Sweet-Sour. Boil in\r\n    water, fat, salt, add vinegar, sugar or syrup, \"English\r\n    aromatics\" and spices, lemon peel, and a little pepper;\r\n    bind with roux.\r\n\r\n    _Id. ibid._, {Rx} No. 213, Cut Pickled Beans\r\n    (_Schneidebohnen_) prepare as {Rx} No. 212, but if you\r\n    would have them more delicious, take instead of the roux\r\n    grated chocolate, sugar, cinnamon, lemon peel and lemon\r\n    juice, and some claret. If not sour enough, add vinegar,\r\n    but right here you must add more fat; you may lay on top\r\n    of this dish a bouquet of sliced apples.\r\n\r\n    _Id. ibid._, {Rx} No. 214, Beans and Pears. Take cut and\r\n    pickled beans and prepare as above. To this add peeled\r\n    fresh pears, cut into quarters; then sugar, lemon peel\r\n    cut thin, cinnamon, \"English\" mixed spices, and at last\r\n    the roux, thinned with broth. This dish must be sweet\r\n    and very fat.\r\n\r\n    As for exotic combinations, Apicius surely survives\r\n    here, is even surpassed by this Jewish cookery book\r\n    where, no doubt, very ancient traditions have been\r\n    stored away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\n[206] THE HERB FENUGREEK\r\n    _F{OE}NUM GRÆCUM_ [1]\r\n\r\nFENUGREEK [is prepared] IN BROTH, OIL AND WINE.\r\n\r\n    [1] Tor. or _fenum_; G.-V. _Fænum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n[207] GREEN STRING BEANS AND CHICK-PEAS\r\n    _PHASEOLI _[1]_ VIRIDES ET CICER_\r\n\r\nARE SERVED WITH SALT, CUMIN, OIL, AND A LITTLE PURE WINE.\r\n\r\n    [1] Tor. _Faseolus_, the bean with a long, sabre-like\r\n    pod; a phasel, kidney bean, when ripened.\r\n\r\n\r\n[208] ANOTHER WAY\r\n    _ALITER FASEOLUS ET CICER_\r\n\r\n[Beans or chick-peas] ARE COOKED IN A WINE SAUCE AND SEASONED WITH\r\nPEPPER [1].\r\n\r\n    [1] Dann. and Goll.: \"roasted\" beans.\r\n\r\n\r\n[209] BOILED, SUMPTUOUSLY\r\n    _ET ELIXATI, SUMPTO_ [1]\r\n\r\nAND COOK THE BEANS, IN A RICH MANNER, REMOVE THE SEEDS AND SERVE [as a\r\nSalad [2]], WITH HARD EGGS, GREEN FENNEL, PEPPER, BROTH, A LITTLE\r\nREDUCED WINE AND A LITTLE SALT, OR SERVE THEM IN SIMPLER WAYS, AS YOU\r\nMAY SEE FIT.\r\n\r\n    [1] The original continues with the preceding formula.\r\n\r\n    [2] For a salad we would add finely chopped onion,\r\n    pepper, and some lemon juice.\r\n\r\n    The purpose of removing the seeds is obscure.

Try this on your turkey legs.\r\n    Danneil is of the opinion that the head and its feathers\r\n    were to be saved for decorative purposes, in style\r\n    during the middle ages when game bird patties were\r\n    decorated with the fowl's plumage, a custom which\r\n    survived to Danneil's time (ca. 1900). But this is not\r\n    likely to be the case here, for it would be a simple\r\n    matter to skin the bird before cooking it in order to\r\n    save the plumage for the taxidermist.\r\n\r\n\r\n[214] CRANE OR DUCK WITH TURNIPS\r\n    _GRUEM VEL ANATEM EX RAPIS_ [1]\r\n\r\nTAKE OUT [remove entrails, [2]] CLEAN WASH AND DRESS [the bird] AND\r\nPARBOIL [2] IT IN WATER WITH SALT AND DILL.

[In a deep dish arrange the\r\nduck] ON TOP OF THE TURNIPS [strain the sauce over it] SPRINKLE WITH\r\nPEPPER AND SERVE.\r\n\r\n    [1] Duck and Turnips, a dish much esteemed on the\r\n    Continent today.

To\r\n    cook the turnips so that they can be squeezed out\r\n    (_exprimo_, from _ex_ and _premo_) is the proper thing\r\n    to do from a culinary standpoint.\r\n\r\n    [4] The turnips are cooked half, the water removed, and\r\n    finished with the duck, as prescribed by Apicius. It is\r\n    really admirable to see how he handles these food\r\n    materials in order to remove any disagreeable flavor,\r\n    which may be the case both with the turnips (the small\r\n    white variety) and the duck.

The dasheen is well adapted for the stuffing of\r\n    fowl. Ordinarily the dasheen is boiled or steamed,\r\n    mashed, seasoned and then stuffed inside of a raw\r\n    chicken which is then roasted. Being very starchy, the\r\n    dasheen readily absorbs the fats and juices of the\r\n    roast, making a delicious dressing, akin in taste to a\r\n    combined potato and chestnut purée.\r\n\r\n    As the above chicken is cooked in _bouillon_ or water,\r\n    the dasheen may be used in a raw state for filling. We\r\n    have tried this method. Instead of confining the chicken\r\n    in a basket, we have tied it in a napkin and boiled\r\n    slowly until done. Serve cold, with the above dressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n[245] CHICKEN À LA VARUS [1]\r\n    _PULLUS VARDANUS_\r\n\r\nCOOK THE CHICKEN IN THIS STOCK: BROTH, OIL, WINE, A BUNCH OF LEEKS,\r\nCORIANDER, SATURY; WHEN DONE, CRUSH PEPPER, NUTS WITH 2 GLASSES OF\r\nWATER [2] AND THE JUICE OF THE CHICKEN.

The figs were\r\n    retired from the sauce pan long before the meat was done\r\n    and they were served around the ham as a garnish. As a\r\n    consequence we partook of a grand dish that no inmate of\r\n    Olympus would have sneezed at.\r\n\r\n    In Pompeii an inn-keeper had written the following on\r\n    the wall of his establishment: _Ubi perna cocta est si\r\n    convivæ apponitur non gustat pernam linguit ollam aut\r\n    caccabum._\r\n\r\n    When we first beheld this message we took the inn-keeper\r\n    for a humorist and clever advertiser; but now we are\r\n    convinced that he was in earnest when he said that his\r\n    guests would lick the sauce pan in which his hams were\r\n    cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n[288] TO COOK PORK SHOULDER\r\n    _PERNÆ _[1]_ COCTURAM_\r\n\r\nHAM SIMPLY COOKED IN WATER WITH FIGS IS USUALLY DRESSED ON A PLATTER\r\n[baking pan] SPRINKLED WITH CRUMBS AND REDUCED WINE, OR, STILL BETTER,\r\nWITH SPICED WINE [and is glazed under the open flame, or with a shovel\r\ncontaining red-hot embers].\r\n\r\n    [1] _Perna_ is usually applied to shoulder of pork,\r\n    fresh, also cured.\r\n\r\n    _Coxa_ is the hind leg, or haunch of pork, or fresh ham.\r\n    Cf. note 1 to {Rx} No. 289.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\n[289] FRESH HAM\r\n    _MUSTEIS _[1]_ PETASONEM_ [2]\r\n\r\nA FRESH HAM IS COOKED WITH 2 POUNDS OF BARLEY AND 25 FIGS.

The trade of the\r\n    _dulciarius_ was so highly developed at that time that\r\n    the professional bakers and confectioners supplied the\r\n    entire home market with their wares, making it\r\n    convenient and unprofitable for the domestic cook to\r\n    compete with their organized business, a condition which\r\n    largely exists in our modern highly civilized centers of\r\n    population today.

Ms., G.-V.\r\n    _afros_; List. _apios_, i.e. celery, which is farthest\r\n    from the mark. Goll. interprets this a \"cider apple,\"\r\n    reminiscent, probably, of _musteos_, which is fresh,\r\n    new, young, and which has here nothing to do with cider.\r\n\r\n    _Aphros_ is not identified. Perhaps the term stood for\r\n    Apricots (Old English: Aphricocks) or some other African\r\n    fruit or plant; Lister's celery is to be rejected on\r\n    gastronomical grounds.\r\n\r\n    The above treatment would correspond to that which is\r\n    given apricots and peaches today. They are peeled,\r\n    immersed in cream and sweetened with sugar. Apicius'\r\n    heating of the fruit in milk is new to us; it sounds\r\n    good, for it has a tendency to parboil any hard fruit,\r\n    make it more digestible and reduce the fluid to a creamy\r\n    consistency.\r\n\r\n    [2] The \"pepper\" again, as pointed out in several other\r\n    places, here is some spice of agreeable taste as are\r\n    used in desserts today.\r\n\r\n\r\n[296] ANOTHER SWEET DISH\r\n    _ALITER DULCIA_\r\n\r\nBREAK [slice] FINE WHITE BREAD, CRUST REMOVED, INTO RATHER LARGE\r\nPIECES WHICH SOAK IN MILK [and beaten eggs] FRY IN OIL, COVER WITH\r\nHONEY AND SERVE [1].\r\n\r\n    [1] \"French\" Toast, indeed!--_Sapienti sat!_\r\n\r\n\r\n[297] ANOTHER SWEET\r\n    _ALITER DULCIA_\r\n\r\nIN A CHAFING-DISH PUT [1] HONEY, PURE WINE, RAISIN WINE, RUE, PINE\r\nNUTS, NUTS, COOKED SPELT, ADD CRUSHED AND TOASTED HAZELNUTS [2] AND\r\nSERVE.\r\n\r\n    [1] G.-V. _Piperato mittis_. _Piperatum_ is a dish\r\n    prepared with pepper, any spicy dish; the term may here\r\n    be applied to the bowl in which the porridge is served.\r\n    Tac. _Dulcia piperata mittis_.\r\n\r\n    [2] Dann.

It\r\n    must be borne in mind, however, that the ancient\r\n    definition of \"custard\" is \"egg cheese,\" probably\r\n    because of the similarity in appearance and texture.\r\n\r\n    Cf. {Rx} Nos. 129 and 143.\r\n\r\n\r\n[302] OMELETTE SOUFFLÉE [1]\r\n    _OVA SPHONGIA EX LACTE_\r\n\r\nFOUR EGGS IN HALF A PINT OF MILK AND AN OUNCE OF OIL WELL BEATEN, TO\r\nMAKE A FLUFFY MIXTURE; IN A PAN PUT A LITTLE OIL, AND CAREFULLY ADD\r\nTHE EGG PREPARATION, WITHOUT LETTING IT BOIL [2] HOWEVER.

Humelberg, quoting Martial, says: _Veneram\r\n    mirè stimulant, unde et salaces à Martiali vocantur._ 1.\r\n    XIII, Ep. 34:\r\n\r\n    _Cum sit anus conjunx, cum sint tibi mortua membra\r\n    Nil aliud, bulbis quam satur esse potes._\r\n\r\n    We fail to find this quotation from Varro in his works,\r\n    M. Teren.

III.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tor. who is trying hard to explain the _colocasium_.\r\n    His name, \"Egyptian Bean\" may be due to the mealiness\r\n    and bean-like texture of the _colocasium_ tuber;\r\n    otherwise there is no resemblance to a bean, except,\r\n    perhaps, the seed pod which is not used for food. This\r\n    simile has led other commentators to believe that the\r\n    _colocasium_ in reality was a bean.\r\n\r\n    The U.S. Department of Agriculture has in recent years\r\n    imported various specimens of that taro species\r\n    (belonging to the _colocasia_), and the plants are now\r\n    successfully being farmed in the southern parts of the\r\n    United States, with fair prospects of becoming an\r\n    important article of daily diet. The Department has\r\n    favored us repeatedly with samples of the taro, or\r\n    dasheen, (_Colocasium Antiquorum_) and we have made many\r\n    different experiments with this agreeable, delightful\r\n    and important \"new\" vegetable. It can be prepared in\r\n    every way like a potato, and possesses advantages over\r\n    the potato as far as value of nutrition, flavor, culture\r\n    and keeping qualities are concerned. As a commercial\r\n    article, it is not any more expensive than any good kind\r\n    of potato. It grows where the potato will not thrive,\r\n    and vice versa. It thus saves much in freight to parts\r\n    where the potato does not grow.\r\n\r\n    The ancient _colocasium_ is no doubt a close relative of\r\n    the modern dasheen or taro. The Apician _colocasium_ was\r\n    perhaps very similar to the ordinary Elephant-Ear,\r\n    _colocasium Antiquorum Schott_, often called _caladium\r\n    esculentum_, or _tanyah_, more recently called the\r\n    \"Dasheen\" which is a corruption of the French \"de\r\n    Chine\"--from China--indicating the supposed origin of\r\n    this variety of taro. The dasheen is a broad-leaved\r\n    member of the _arum_ family. The name dasheen originated\r\n    in the West Indies whence it was imported into the\r\n    United States around 1910, and the name is now\r\n    officially adopted.\r\n\r\n    Mark Catesby, in his Natural History of Carolina,\r\n    Florida and the Bahama Islands, London, 1781, describes\r\n    briefly under the name of _arum maximum Aegypticum_ a\r\n    plant which was doubtless one of the tanyahs or taros.\r\n    He says: \"This was a welcome improvement among the\r\n    negroes and was esteemed a blessing; they being\r\n    delighted with all their African food, particularly\r\n    this, which a great part of Africa subsists much on.\"\r\n\r\n    Torinus, groping for the right name, calls it variously\r\n    _colosium_, _coledium_, _coloesium_, till he finally\r\n    gets it right, _colocasium_.\r\n\r\n    [3] The root or tubers of this plant was used by the\r\n    ancients as a vegetable. They probably boiled and then\r\n    peeled and sliced the tubers, seasoning the pieces with\r\n    the above ingredients, heated them in bouillon stock and\r\n    thickened the gravy in the usual way. Since the tuber is\r\n    very starchy, little roux is required for binding.\r\n\r\n    [4] Afterthought by Tor. printed in italics on the\r\n    margin of his book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nSNAILS\r\n  _COCHLEAS_\r\n\r\n\r\n[323] MILK-FED SNAILS\r\n    _COCHLEAS LACTE PASTAS_\r\n\r\nTAKE SNAILS AND SPONGE THEM; PULL THEM OUT OF THE SHELLS BY THE\r\nMEMBRANE AND PLACE THEM FOR A DAY IN A VESSEL WITH MILK AND SALT [1]\r\nRENEW THE MILK DAILY.

Fluvius Hirpinus is credited\r\n    with having popularized the snail in Rome a little\r\n    before the civil wars between Cæsar and Pompey. If we\r\n    could believe Varro, snails grew to enormous\r\n    proportions. A supper of the younger Pliny consisted of\r\n    a head of lettuce, three snails, two eggs, a barley\r\n    cake, sweet wine, refrigerated in snow.\r\n\r\n    Snails as a food are not sufficiently appreciated by the\r\n    Germanic races who do not hesitate to eat similar\r\n    animals and are very fond of such food as oysters,\r\n    clams, mussels, cocles, etc., much of which they even\r\n    eat in the raw state.\r\n\r\n\r\n[324] ANOTHER WAY\r\n    _ALITER_\r\n\r\nTHE SNAILS ARE FRIED WITH PURE SALT AND OIL AND [a sauce of] LASER,\r\nBROTH, PEPPER AND OIL IS UNDERLAID; OR THE FRIED SNAILS ARE FULLY\r\nCOVERED WITH BROTH, PEPPER AND CUMIN.\r\n\r\n    Tor. divides this into three articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n[325] ANOTHER WAY FOR SNAILS\r\n    _ALITER COCHLEAS_\r\n\r\nTHE LIVE SNAILS ARE SPRINKLED WITH MILK MIXED WITH THE FINEST WHEAT\r\nFLOUR, WHEN FAT AND NICE AND PLUMP THEY ARE COOKED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nEGGS\r\n  _OVA_\r\n\r\n\r\n[326] FRIED EGGS\r\n    _OVA FRIXA_\r\n\r\nFRIED EGGS ARE FINISHED IN WINE SAUCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[327] BOILED EGGS\r\n    _OVA ELIXA_\r\n\r\nARE SEASONED WITH BROTH, OIL, PURE WINE, OR ARE SERVED WITH BROTH,\r\nPEPPER AND LASER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[328] WITH POACHED EGGS\r\n    _IN OVIS HAPALIS_\r\n\r\nSERVE PEPPER, LOVAGE, SOAKED NUTS, HONEY, VINEGAR AND BROTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF BOOK VII\r\n\r\n_EXPLICIT APICII POLYTELES: LIBER SEPTIMUS_ [Tac.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPICIUS\r\n\r\nBook VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{Illustration: CRATICULA\r\n\r\nCombination broiler and stove; charcoal fuel.

This granted, he\r\n    calls out with a loud voice to his parents to save for\r\n    them the food that was to have been his own in the\r\n    future, to wit:\r\n\r\n    \"To my father, Mr. Genuine Bacon-Fat, appointed by me\r\n    in my last will I give and bequeath: thirty measures of\r\n    acorns; and to my mother, Mrs. Old-Timer Sow, appointed\r\n    by me in my last will, I give and bequeath: forty\r\n    measures of Spartan wheat; and to my sister, Cry-Baby,\r\n    appointed by me in my last will, whose wedding, alas!

Quite correctly, he questions the need of\r\n    condiments for salt fish.\r\n\r\n    [4] List. uses this last sentence as the title for the\r\n    next formula, implying that more salt be added to the\r\n    salt fish; Tor. is explicit in saying that no salt be\r\n    added which of course, is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nANOTHER WAY, WITHOUT SALT [PORK?]\r\n  _ALITER, SINE SALSO_ [1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[428] FISH LIVER PUDDING\r\n    _SALSUM, SINE SALSO_ [2]\r\n\r\nCOOK THE LIVER [of the mullet] CRUSH [3] AND ADD PEPPER, EITHER BROTH\r\nOR SALT [4] ADD OIL, LIVER OF HARE, OR OF LAMB [5] OR OF CHICKEN, AND,\r\nIF YOU LIKE, PRESS INTO A FISH MOULD [6] [unmould, after baking]\r\nSPRINKLE WITH VIRGIN OIL [7].\r\n\r\n    [1] Tor.\r\n\r\n    [2] G.-V. plainly, a contradiction.

A very nutritious dish and\r\n    a most ingenious device, requiring much skill.\r\n\r\n    This is another good example of Roman cookery, far from\r\n    being extravagant as it is reputed to be, it is\r\n    economical and clever, and shows ingenuity in the\r\n    utilization of good things which are often discarded as\r\n    worthless.\r\n\r\n\r\n[429] ANOTHER WAY, FOR A CHANGE!\r\n    _ALITER VICEM GERENS SALSI_ [1]\r\n\r\nCUMIN, PEPPER, BROTH, WHICH CRUSH, ADDING A LITTLE RAISIN WINE, OR\r\nREDUCED WINE, AND A QUANTITY OF CRUSHED NUTS.

While we have\r\n    no direct proof, we are inclined to believe that Book X\r\n    is a Roman version of a Greek treatise on fish sauces, a\r\n    monograph, of which there existed many, according to\r\n    Athenæus, which specialized on the various departments\r\n    of cookery.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tor. _Diabotom_ (in Greek characters); Greek,\r\n    relating to herbs.\r\n\r\n    [3] Tor.

Today we use flour and water\r\n    made into a stiff paste to seal a pan hermetically if no\r\n    \"pressure cooker\" is available.\r\n\r\n    This formula cannot be classified under \"Sauce for\r\n    Boiled Fish.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[436] ANOTHER SAUCE FOR BOILED FISH\r\n    _ALITER IUS IN PISCE ELIXO_\r\n\r\nWHEN THE FISH IS PREPARED, PUT THE SAME IN A FLAT PAN WITH CORIANDER\r\nSEED, WATER AND GREEN DILL; WHEN COOKED SPRINKLE WITH VINEGAR AND\r\nSERVE [1].\r\n\r\n    [1] Another fair example of the incompleteness, on the\r\n    one hand, of the directions, and of the superfluity, on\r\n    the other hand, of words such as the initial and the\r\n    closing words, which characterizes so many of the\r\n    formulæ. This is characteristic of ever so many culinary\r\n    authors of all ages, who, lacking literary training,\r\n    assume that the reader is thoroughly versed with the\r\n    methods indicated. A versatile modern author would have\r\n    said: \"Poach the filleted fish in small water seasoned\r\n    with coriander seed and green dill; sprinkle with\r\n    vinegar before serving.\" He mentioned neither the salt\r\n    nor the oil which he undoubtedly used.\r\n\r\n\r\n[437] ALEXANDRINE [1] SAUCE FOR BROILED FISH\r\n    _IUS ALEXANDRINUM IN PISCE ASSO_\r\n\r\nPEPPER, DRY ONIONS [shallots] LOVAGE, CUMIN, ORIGANY, CELERY SEED,\r\nSTONED DAMASCUS PRUNES [pounded in the mortar] FILLED UP [2] WITH\r\nVINEGAR, BROTH, REDUCED MUST, AND OIL, AND COOK IT.\r\n\r\n    [1] Alexandria, Egyptian city, at the mouth of the river\r\n    Nile, third of the three great cities of antiquity\r\n    excepting Carthage during Apicius' time a rival of Rome\r\n    and Athens in splendor and commerce.

Usually\r\n    it follows pepper. We have finally accounted for this\r\n    peculiarity. Torinus, throughout the original, treats\r\n    \"pepper\" and \"lovage\" as one spice, whereas we have kept\r\n    the two separate. He believed it to be a certain kind of\r\n    pepper--_piper Ligusticum_. _Piper_, as a matter of\r\n    fact, stands for pepper, and _Ligusticum_ is the herb,\r\n    Lovage, an umbelliferous plant, also called\r\n    _Levisticum_. The fact that the two words are here\r\n    separated plainly shows that Torinus has been in the\r\n    dark about this matter almost to the end.\r\n\r\n    One wonders why he did not change or correct this error\r\n    in the preceding books. His marginal errata prove that\r\n    his work was being printed as he wrote it, or furnished\r\n    copy therefor--namely in installments. Since the\r\n    printer's type was limited, each sheet was printed in\r\n    the complete edition, and the type was then used over\r\n    again for the next sheet.\r\n\r\n    [3] Tor. _thun_.\r\n\r\n    [4] Wanting in Tor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[467] ANOTHER SAUCE FOR EEL\r\n    _ALITER IUS IN ANGUILLAM_\r\n\r\nPEPPER, LOVAGE, SYRIAN SUMACH, DRY MINT, RUE BERRIES, HARD YOLKS,\r\nMEAD, VINEGAR, BROTH, OIL; COOK IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF BOOK X THE LAST OF THE BOOKS OF APICIUS\r\n\r\n_CELII APITII HALIEUS LIBER DECIMUS & ULTIMUS.

Of his time and life very little is\r\nknown. It appears that he was a student of Apicius and that he made\r\ncertain excerpts from that book which are preserved in the uncial\r\ncodex of Salmasius, sæc. VIII, Paris, lat. 10318.\r\n\r\nVollmer in his Apicius commentary says that Salmasius and his\r\npredecessors have accepted them as genuine. Schuch incorporated these\r\nrecipes in the Apicius text of his editions, in appropriate places, as\r\nhe thought. This course cannot be recommended, although the recipes\r\nshould form an integral part of any Apicius edition.\r\n\r\nM. Ihm, who faithfully reprinted the excerpta in the Archiv f. lat.\r\nLex. XV, 64, ff. says distinctly: \"These excerpts have nothing to do\r\nwith the ten books of Apicius, even if some recipes resemble each\r\nother ...\" and other researchers have expressed the same opinion.\r\nVollmer, however, does not share this view.\r\n\r\nIf I may be permitted to concur with Vollmer, I would say that the\r\nexcerpts are quite Apician in character, and that in a sense they fill\r\ncertain gaps in the Apicius text, although the language is strongly\r\nvulgarized which may be readily expected to be the case in the age of\r\nVinidarius.\r\n\r\nThe recipes of Anthimus, written around A.D. 511 also confirm the\r\nclose relation existing between Vinidarius and Apicius. Anthimus was\r\nthe Greek physician to Theodoric I, (The Great), Frankish king living\r\nin Italy. He was not acquainted with Apicius.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF SPICES\r\n  _BREVIS PIMENTORUM_ [1]\r\n\r\nWHICH SHOULD BE IN THE HOUSE ON HAND SO THAT THERE MAY BE NOTHING\r\nWANTING [in the line of condiments]: SAFFRON, PEPPER, GINGER, LASER,\r\nLEAVES [laurel-bay-nard], MYRTLE BERRIES, COSTMARY, CHERVIL [2],\r\nINDIAN SPIKENARD, ADDENA [3], CARDAMOM, SPIKENARD.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Pigmentorum_--_specierum_--spices.

In\r\n    these formulas the terms have lost all resemblance to\r\n    the former meaning, the original \"salt meat boiled in a\r\n    pot.\" Such changes are very often observed in the\r\n    terminology of our modern kitchens, in every language.\r\n    They make the definition of terms and the classification\r\n    of subjects extremely difficult. They add much to the\r\n    confusion among cooks and guests in public dining places\r\n    and create misunderstandings that only an expert can\r\n    explain.\r\n\r\n    [2] This dish affords an opportunity for a decorative\r\n    scheme by the arrangement of the various vegetables and\r\n    meats in a pleasing and artistic manner, utilizing the\r\n    various colors and shapes of the bits of food as one\r\n    would use pieces of stone in a mosaic. Of course, such a\r\n    design can be appreciated only if the chartreuse is\r\n    served unmoulded, i.e. if the cook succeeds in\r\n    unmoulding it without damaging the structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n[471] BRAISED CUTLETS\r\n    _OFELLAS GARATAS_ [1]\r\n\r\nPLACE THE MEAT IN A STEW PAN, ADD ONE POUND [2] OF BROTH, A LIKE\r\nQUANTITY OF OIL, A TRIFLE OF HONEY, AND THUS BRAISE [3].\r\n\r\n    [1] Derived from _garum_ or _{oe}nogarum_, the wine\r\n    sauce. These are supposed to be meat balls or cutlets\r\n    prepared with garum, but the _garum_ is not mentioned in\r\n    the formula. This also illustrates the interesting\r\n    etymology of the word. It is not recognized in every-day\r\n    ancient language because it is a typical technical term,\r\n    the much complained-of _lingua culinaria_. We find,\r\n    therefore, that--at least in this instance--_garum_ no\r\n    longer stands for a sauce made from the fish, _garus_,\r\n    but that _garum_ has become a generic term for certain\r\n    kinds of sauces. Danneil renders _garatus_ with\r\n    _lasaratus_, which is clearly out of place.\r\n\r\n    [2] In this instance, and in several others, and also\r\n    according to Sueton. Cæs. fluids were weighed. What idea\r\n    could be more practical, useful and more \"modern\" than\r\n    this? Sheer commercial greed, stubbornness, indolence\r\n    have thus far made futile all efforts towards more\r\n    progressive methods in handling food stuffs,\r\n    particularly in the weighing of them and in selling them\r\n    by their weight. Present market methods are very\r\n    chaotic, and are kept purposely so to the detriment of\r\n    the buyer.\r\n\r\n    [3] The original: _et sic frigis_.--_Frigo_ is\r\n    equivalent to frying, drying, parching; the word here\r\n    has taken on a broader meaning, because the \"frying\"\r\n    process is clearly out of question here. It appears that\r\n    the terminology of _frigo_ and that of _asso_ in the\r\n    next formula, has not been clearly defined. As a matter\r\n    of fact, not many modern cooks today are able to give a\r\n    clear definition of such terms as frying, broiling,\r\n    roasting, braising, baking, which are thus subject to\r\n    various interpretations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n[472] ROAST MEAT BALLS\r\n    _OFELLAS ASSAS_\r\n\r\nMEATBALLS [previously sauté], CAREFULLY PREPARED, ARRANGE IN A SHALLOW\r\nSTEW PAN AND BRAISE THEM IN WINE SAUCE; AFTERWARDS SERVE THEM IN THE\r\nSAME SAUCE OR GRAVY, SPRINKLED WITH PEPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n[473] GLAZED CUTLETS\r\n    _ALITER OFELLAS_\r\n\r\nTHE MEAT PIECES ARE BRAISED [1] IN BROTH AND ARE GLAZED [2] WITH HOT\r\nHONEY [3] AND THUS SERVED.\r\n\r\n    [1] Cf. note 3 to Excerpta III.\r\n\r\n    [2] _unguantur._\r\n\r\n    [3] Dann. oil; G.-V. _melle_--_honey_.

IT IS NECESSARY\r\nTHAT THE FISH BE ENTIRELY COVERED BY THIS LIQUOR SO THAT THERE MAY BE\r\nSUFFICIENT JUICE DURING THE COOKING.\r\n\r\n    [1] The ancients considered the murena one of the finest\r\n    of fish; the best were brought from the straits of\r\n    Sicily. Rich Romans kept them alive in their fish ponds,\r\n    often large and elaborate marble basins called,\r\n    _piscina_, fattened the fish, kept it ready for use.\r\n    Pollio fattened murenas on human flesh, killing a slave\r\n    on the slightest provocation and throwing the body into\r\n    the fish pond; he would eat only the liver of such\r\n    murenas. This is the only case of such cruelty on\r\n    record, and it has often been cited and exaggerated.\r\n\r\n    [2] Perhaps the sea-eel, or conger, according to Dann.\r\n    Also very much esteemed.

The presence here of water leads us to\r\n    believe that the thrush were not \"cooked,\" i.e. \"boiled\"\r\n    but that they were fried in a generous amount of oil;\r\n    this would make the ancient process remarkably similar\r\n    to the present European way of preparing thrush or\r\n    fieldfare, or similar game birds.\r\n\r\n    For water used to clarify oil see note 3 to {Rx} No.\r\n    250.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\n\r\n[498] TURTLEDOVES\r\n    _TURTURES_\r\n\r\nOPEN THEM, PREPARE [marinate] CAREFULLY; CRUSH PEPPER, LASER, A LITTLE\r\nBROTH, IMMERSE THE DOVES IN THIS PREPARATION SO THAT IT WILL BE\r\nABSORBED BY THEM, AND THUS ROAST THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\n\r\n[499] SAUCE FOR PARTRIDGE [1]\r\n    _IUS IN PERDICES_\r\n\r\nCRUSH IN THE MORTAR PEPPER, CELERY, MINT, AND RUE; MOISTEN WITH\r\nVINEGAR, ADD FIGDATE [wine], HONEY, VINEGAR, BROTH, OIL; LET IT BOIL\r\nLIKEWISE AND SERVE.\r\n\r\n    [1] This formula evidently is a fragment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE SUMMARY OF DISHES [of the Excerpts of Vinidarius]\r\n\r\n_EXPLI [cit] BREUIS CIBORUM_\r\n\r\n[END OF THE RECIPES OF APICIUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{Illustration: TITLE PAGE, LISTER EDITION, AMSTERDAM, 1709\r\n\r\nLister's second edition was printed at Amsterdam, 1709, by very able\r\nprinters, the Jansson-Wæsbergs.

Phillipps, 275, in the library of\r\nSir Thomas Phillipps, a codex ca. Ninth century, 4to, parchment, 275\r\npp., originally bound up with Phill. 386, which is said to have come\r\nfrom the Benedictine Abbey of St. Ghislain, founded at the end of the\r\n7th century in the diocese of Cambrai; partly in Continental, but\r\nmostly in Anglo-Saxon minuscle of the 9th century, not unlike the\r\nAnglo-Saxon minuscle of Fulda.\r\n\r\nTitle missing. Cf. Vollmer, Studien, pp. 5-6.\r\n\r\nThe writer who has hastily inspected the manuscript in 1931 is of the\r\nopinion that three different hands wrote this book. Part of the index\r\nis gone, too. The book commences with lib. VII of the index. Bound in\r\nan 18th century French full leather binding. It was brought to America\r\nby Dr. Margaret B. Wilson and presented to the library of the A. of M.\r\nin 1931.\r\n\r\n\r\nII, 9TH CENTURY\r\n\r\nRome, Vatican Library. Vat. Vrbinas, lat. 1146, Ninth century. 58\r\nsheets, 2 blanks in the beginning and 2 at the end. Size 23.75 × 18.75\r\ncm., heavy parchment, 20-21 lines to the page, not numbered.

Sheet 3 V a panel in purple\r\nsimilar to sheet 1 R with inscription, IN{=C}{=P} || CONDIT{=V} ||\r\nPARADOX{=V}. Sheet 4 R commences the text with the title, I, Conditum\r\nParadoxum. Captions, marginal figures and initials in red. The\r\ncaptions are written in good uncials throughout, the first text words\r\nusually in half uncials, continuing in an even and beautiful minuscle.\r\nThe Explicits and Incipits invariably in capitalis rustica. Sheet 58 V\r\nend of text with EXPLICIT LIBER X.\r\n\r\nTraube, Vollmer and others believe that this manuscript was written in\r\nor in the vicinity of Tours in the 9th century.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII, 8TH CENTURY\r\n\r\nParis, lat. 10318. 8th century. Codex Salmasianus, pp. 196-203, Apici\r\nexcerpta a Vinidario vir. inl.

In 1529 Torinus found an Apicius \"codex\" on the\r\nisland of Megalona (Maguellone) which he used for his edition of\r\nApicius. It is almost certain that this was not a very ancient\r\nmanuscript. The way Torinus speaks of it and of the (first) Venetian\r\nprinted edition in his _epistola dedicatoria_ leaves even doubt as to\r\nwhether his authority was handwritten or printed. A first edition,\r\nprinted ca. 1483, may have well been a dilapidated copy such as\r\nTorinus describes in 1529. Torinus admits taking some liberties with\r\nthe text and failed to understand some phrases of it. Despite this\r\nfact, his text, from a culinary point of view seems to be more\r\nauthentic than the Humelbergius and Lister versions.\r\n\r\nThe other codex according to Torinus, was found in Transsylvania by\r\nIo. Honterus of Coronea. This codex may have served as authority for\r\nthe first edition printed ca. 1483 by Bernardinus, of Venice. No other\r\nmention is made of this codex anywhere, which according to Torinus,\r\nwas sent to Venice from Transsylvania. The text of the Editio\r\nPrinceps, by the way, is thoroughly unreliable.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII, 15TH CENTURY\r\n\r\nMs. Rome, Vatican Library, lat. 6803, 15th Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII, 15TH CENTURY\r\n\r\nMunich, lat. 756.

Of the\r\nwell-known collections of cookery books the most outstanding perhaps\r\nis that of Theodor Drexel, of Frankfurt on the Main, who owned nine\r\ndifferent editions of Apicius. The Drexel catalogue forms the basis of\r\na bibliography--Verzeichnis der Litteratur über Speise und Trank bis\r\nzum Jahre 1887, bearbeitet von Carl Georg, Hannover, 1888, describing\r\nsome 1700 works.\r\n\r\nThe Drexel collection, combined with that of Dr. Freund, is now in the\r\nStaatsbibliothek in Berlin and is undoubtedly the finest collection of\r\nits kind.\r\n\r\nAnother famous collection of cookery books is described in My Cookery\r\nBooks, by Elizabeth Robins Pennell, Boston, 1903, listing three of the\r\nApicii.\r\n\r\nThe Pennell collection was destroyed by a flood in London while being\r\nstored away in a warehouse during the world war.\r\n\r\nThe most important bibliography, well-known to bibliophiles, is the\r\nBibliographie gastronomique par Georges Vicaire, Paris, 1890. Vicaire\r\nmentions eleven Apicius editions.\r\n\r\nThe Baron Pichon and the Georges Vicaire collections are both\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nDespite ardent efforts over a period of many years the writer has been\r\nunable to secure either an Apicius manuscript or the editions No. 1\r\nand 2. The existence of No. 2 on our list is doubtful. Therefore, we\r\ndo not pretend having inspected or read each and every edition\r\ndescribed herein, but by combining the efforts of the authorities here\r\ncited we have gathered the following titles and descriptions in order\r\nto present a complete survey of the Apician literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 1 CA.

Georg-Drexel, No. 13; Pennell, p. 111; Vicaire, col. 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 2, MILAN, A.D. 1490\r\n\r\n    APICIUS CULINARIS (_sic_) (CURA BLASII LANCILOTI _In\r\n    fine_) IMPRESSUM MEDIOLANI PER MAGISTRUM GUILIERUM DE\r\n    SIGNERRE ROTHOMAGENSEM. ANNO DOMINI M CCCC LXXXX DIE\r\n    VIII MENSIS JANUARII.\r\n\r\nLarge 8vo. Edition disputed by bibliographers.\r\n\r\nEx Bernhold, _præfatio_, p. IX, who (we are translating from his Latin\r\ntext) says, \"Here is the exterior of the book as extant in the\r\nNuremberg library, most accurately and neatly described by the very\r\nfamous and most worthy physician of that illustrious republic, Dr.\r\nPreus, a friend of mine for thirty years; whose integrity, of course,\r\nis above reproach; these are his own words--The book is made in the\r\nsize called large octavo. It must be mentioned that the sheets are\r\nindeed large, so that the size might be styled an ordinary quarto.\r\nFabricius, in his Bibliotheca, the newest edition, quotes a copy under\r\nthis name. The entire book consists of five parts [sheets, folded into\r\neight leaves--sixteen printed pages--stitched together] and two\r\nleaves. These five parts contain the text proper; these two sheets\r\npreceding them, are occupied by the title page, the dedication and a\r\nkind of poetic address. The text itself commences with p. 5, I should\r\nsay, though there is no regular pagination. However, there are\r\nnevertheless in the lower ends of the leaves, called the limp parts,\r\nsome conspicuous letters on the first four leaves of the sheets, while\r\nthe remaining four leaves though belonging to the respective parts,\r\nare blank. For instance aI., aII., aIII., aIIII. Then follows the next\r\nsheet or part, signed, bI., II., III., IIII. in the same manner, with\r\nthe four following leaves blank. And thus in the same manner follows\r\nsheet c, d, e. The two leaves preceding the five parts which comprise\r\nthe text proper, contain the title of the book, Apicius Culinaris\r\n[_sic_] nowhere, to be sure, appears a note of the place or the date\r\nwhere and when the book was made, and on this whole first page, aside\r\nfrom the words already noted, there is nothing else in evidence than\r\nthe picture of an angel, in the center of which there is the sign,\r\nIHS, and around the circle the following words are read, 'Joannes de\r\nLagniano M.' At the feet of the angel spaces may be seen that are\r\ninscribed with the letters, I.O.L. The next page, or the verso of the\r\ntitle page, exhibits the dedication of Blasius Lancilotus, extending\r\nto the upper part of the third page. On this very same page occurs the\r\npoem by Ludovicus Vopiscus, addressed to Joannes Antonius Riscius,\r\ncomprising five very beautiful distichs. The remaining part of the\r\nthird page is finished off with the word, 'Finis,' while the fourth\r\npage is entirely blank. The text of Apicius commences with the fifth,\r\nas mentioned above, and from now on the leaves are numbered by\r\nletters, as previously described. At the end of the text, on the last\r\npage of the book, a poem is conspicuous, entitled, 'Antonius Mota to\r\nthe Public,' consisting of four neat distichs, followed by another\r\ncomposition, containing five distichs by Joannes Salandus. And\r\nconclusion of the entire work is made with these words, 'Printed at\r\nMilan by Master Guiliermus de Signerre Rothomagensis, in the year of\r\nthe Lord 1490, on the 8th day of the month of January.'\r\n\r\n\"From this edition, the oldest as well as the rarest--with no other\r\nknown earlier edition--all the variants given herewith have been\r\ncollected by Goezius.\" Thus far Bernhold.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this edition is doubted by Brunet, according to\r\nVicaire. This ancient description corresponds substantially to that of\r\nVicaire of the following edition of 1498 which Vicaire proclaims to be\r\nthe first dated Apicius edition. It is interesting to note, however,\r\nwhat Bernhold has to say of this 1498 edition.\r\n\r\n\"Without a doubt a repetition of the preceding edition,\" says he; and\r\nhe goes on quoting the Bibliotheca Latina Fabricio-Ernestina (Jo.\r\nAlberti Fabricii Bibliothec. Latin. edit ab Ernesti 1708) to the\r\neffect that two editions were printed at Milan, one of 1490 by Blasius\r\nLancilotus and one of 1498 by Guiliermus de Signerre Rothomagensis.\r\n\r\nOur inquiry at the Municipal library of Nürnberg has revealed the\r\nfact that this copy of 1490 is no longer in the possession of the\r\nlibrary there.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 3, A.D. 1498, MILAN\r\n\r\n    APICIUS CULINARIUS (_in fine_) IMPRESSUM MEDIOLANI PER\r\n    MAGISTRUM GUILERUM SIGNERRE ROTHOMAGENSEM, ANNO DNI\r\n    MCCCCLXXXXVIII, DIE XX, MENSIS IANUARII.\r\n\r\n(Ex Pennell, p. 111) First dated edition, 4to, 40 sheets, pages not\r\nnumbered.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: COLOPHON, MILAN EDITION, 1498\r\n\r\nFrom the Lancilotus edition of Apicius, printed by Signerre, Milan,\r\n1498, the first dated edition.

There are\r\ncertain copies of this edition, bearing the following titles, Apicius\r\nde re coquinaria and Apicivs in re qvoqvinaria. Cf.

The\r\nsecond place is given APICIUS DE RE COQUINARIA printed by Bernardinus\r\nde Vitalibus at Venice, no date, circa 1500 (our No. 1). This\r\nclassification follows that of Brunet in 1840. Neither the\r\nGesamtkatalog nor Brunet make any mention whatsoever of the doubtful\r\n1490 Milan edition (our No. 2).\r\n\r\nVicaire, col. 33, mentioning this edition citing Bernhold, quotes\r\nBrunet as doubting the existence of this 1490 edition, but we fail to\r\nnotice this expression of doubt since our Brunet is altogether silent\r\non the subject, same as the other bibliographers.\r\n\r\nVicaire, col. 28-29, quotes Brunet as saying that the undated Apicius\r\n(our No. 1) despite its sub-titles of Suetonius, contains only the\r\nApicius text, a statement confirmed by Pennell.\r\n\r\nA search of all the available works of Joh. Alb. Fabricius--Bibliotheca\r\nLatina [Classics], Hamburg, 1722, Bibliographia Antiquaria, ib. 1760\r\nand the Bibliotheca Latina mediæ et infimæ [middle ages], ib. 1735, has\r\nfailed to reveal a trace of the 1490 Apicius, displayed by Bernhold, as\r\ndescribed by Fabricius and as seen by Preus in the Nürnberg Municipal\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\nOur facsimile of the 1498 colophon shows how easily its date can be\r\nmistaken for \"the 8th day of January, 1490,\" Bernhold's very date!\r\nEvidently an error of this kind made victims of Preus, Bernhold and\r\nFabricius (if, indeed, he quoted it) and caused us some ardent\r\nsearching among dusty tomes. We have therefore come to the conclusion\r\nthat either this 1490 edition disappeared between the year 1787 and\r\nour time or else that it never existed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 4, A.D. 1503, VENICE\r\n\r\n    APITII CELII DE RE COQUINARIA LIBRI DECEM. || COQUINARIÆ\r\n    CAPITA GRÆCA AB APITIO POSITA HÆC SUNT. || EPIMELES:\r\n    ARTOPTUS: CEPURICA: PANDECTER: OSPRION || TROPHETES:\r\n    POLYTELES: TETRAPUS: THALASSA: HALIEUS || HANC PLATO\r\n    ADULATRICEM MEDICINÆ APPELLAT || [_in fine_] IMPRESSUM\r\n    UENETIIS P IOHANNEM DE CERETO DE TRIDINO ALIAS TACUINUM.\r\n    M.CCCCC.III.

Early printers stole copiously from one another,\r\nfrequently reproduced books with hundreds of illustrations with\r\nstartling speed. Gryphius corrected Torinus' spelling of \"P\"\r\n[Bartholomæus] Platina, but note the spelling of \"Lvg[v]dvni\" (Lyons).\r\nInscription by a contemporary reader over the griffin: \"This [book]\r\namuses me!

This\r\nedition, printed by Gryphius, bears the abbreviated title as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 6, A.D. 1541, LYONS\r\n\r\n    CÆLII || APITII SVM || MI ADVLATRICIS || MEDICINÆ\r\n    ARTIFICIS, || DE RE CULINARIA LIBRI || DECEM || B.\r\n    PLATINÆ CREMONEN || SIS DE TUENDA UALETUDINE, NATURA\r\n    RERUM & POPINÆ || SCIENTIA LIBRI X, || PAULI ÆGINETÆ DE\r\n    FACULTATIBUS ALIMENTORUM TRACTATUS, || ALBANO TORINO\r\n    INTER || PRETE.\r\n\r\nThe lower center of the title page is occupied by the Gryphius\r\nprinter's device, a griffin standing on a box-like pedestal, supported\r\nby a winged globe. On the left of the device: \"virtute duci,\" on the\r\nright: \"comite fortuna\"; directly underneath: \"Apvd Seb. Gryphivm,\r\nLvgvdvni [_sic_], 1541.\" Sm. 8vo. Pages numbered, commencing with\r\nverso of title from 2-314. Sheets lettered same as Basel edition; on\r\nverso of title \"Katalogos\" etc. exactly like Basel. Page 3 commences\r\nwith the same epistola dedicatoria. This dedication and the entire\r\ncorpus of the book is printed in an awkward Italic type, except the\r\ncaptions which are in 6 pt. and 8 pt. Roman. The book is quite an\r\nunpleasant contrast with the fine Antiqua type and the generous\r\nmargins of the Basel edition. Some woodcut initials but of small\r\ninterest. The index, contrary to Basel, is in the back. The last page\r\nshows another printer's device, differing from that on the title,\r\nanother griffin.\r\n\r\nThis edition, though bearing Platina's correct initial, B., has the\r\nfictitious title given to his work by Torinus, who probably possessed\r\none of the earliest editions of Platina's De honesta Voluptate,\r\nprinted without a title page.\r\n\r\nAltogether, this Lyons edition looks very much like a hurried job, and\r\nwe would not be surprised to learn that it was pirated from the Basel\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nThe epistola dedicatoria, in which Torinus expresses fear of pirates\r\nand asks his patron's protection, is concluded with the date, Basileæ,\r\nv. Idus Martias, Anno M. D. XLI., while the copy described by Vicaire\r\nappears to be without this date. Vicaire also says that the sheets of\r\nhis copy are not numbered. He also reads on the title \"Lvgdvni, 1541\"\r\nwhich is spelled correctly, but not in accordance with the original.\r\nOf these two editions Vicaire says:\r\n\r\n\"Ces deux éditions portent la même date de 1541, mais celle qui a été\r\npubliée à Bâle a paru avant celle donnée à Lyon par Seb. Gryphe. Cette\r\ndernière, en effet, contient la dédicace datée.\" The title page of our\r\ncopy is inscribed by three different old hands, one the characteristic\r\nremark: \"Mulcens me, gannis?\" This copy is bound in the original\r\nvellum. Vicaire, 31, G.-Drexel, No. 12.\r\n\r\nThe work of Torinus has been subjected to a searching analysis, as\r\nwill be shown throughout the book. An appreciation of Platina will be\r\nfound in Platina, mæstro nell'arte culinaria Un'interessante studio di\r\nJoseph D. Vehling, by Agostino Cavalcabò, Cremona, 1935.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: TITLE PAGE, HUMELBERGIUS EDITION, ZÜRICH, 1542\r\n\r\nThe Gabriel Humelbergius edition is printed by Froschauer, one of the\r\ngreat printers of the Renaissance.

Paris René Bonnel Éditeur rue\r\nBlanche, No. 8.\r\n\r\nNo date (_in fine_ October 16th, 1933). Three blank leaves, false\r\ntitle; on verso, facing the title page (!) \"_du mème auteur_\"--a\r\nfull-page advertisement of the author's many-sided publications, past\r\nand future. Title page, verso blank. On p. ix _Introduction_, a\r\nlengthy discourse on dining in ancient times, including a mention of\r\nApician manuscripts and editions. This commences on p. Li with _Les\r\nManuscrits d'Apicius_. The _Introduction_ finishes on p. Lxxviii. On\r\np. 1 _Les Dix Livres d'Apicius_, on p. 2 a facsimile in black of the\r\n_incipit_ of the Vatican manuscript, Apiciana II. On p. 3 commences\r\nthe translation into French of the Apician text, finishing on p. 308.\r\n_Table Analytique_ (index) pp. 309-322. Follow three unnumbered\r\nsheets, on the first page of which is the _Justification du tirage_,\r\nwith the date of printing and the printer's name, Durand of Chartres.\r\nThe copies printed are numbered from 1 to 679. The copy before us is\r\nNo. 2; copies 1 to 4 are printed on Montval vellum, 5 to 29 on Dutch\r\nPannekoek vellum, the rest, 30 to 679 on Vidalon vellum paper.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the present work did not reach us until after ours had\r\ngone to press. The text of this edition, the first to appear in the\r\nFrench language, could not be considered in our work, for this reason.\r\n\r\nHowever, a few casual remarks about it may be in order here.\r\n\r\nA hasty perusal reveals the disconcerting fact that the editor has\r\nbeen influenced by and has followed the example of Schuch by the\r\nadoption of his system of numbering the recipes. We do not approve of\r\nhis inclusion of the excerpts of Vinidarius in the Apician text.\r\n\r\nThe observations presented in this edition are rich and varied. The\r\nmaterial, comprising the _Introduction_ and also the explanatory\r\nnotes to the recipes are interesting, copious and well-authenticated.\r\nThe editor reveals himself to be a better scholar, well-read in the\r\nclassics, than a practical cook, well-versed in kitchen practice.\r\nFrequently, for instance, he confounds _liquamen_ with _garum_, the\r\nage-old shortcoming of the Apician scholars.\r\n\r\nThe advertisement facing the title page of this work is misplaced,\r\ndisturbing.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we welcome this French version which merits a thorough\r\nstudy; this we hope to publish at some future date. Any serious and\r\nnew information on Apicius is welcome and much needed to clear up the\r\nmysteries. The advent of a few additional cooks on the scene doesn't\r\nmatter. Let them give lie to the old proverb that too many cooks spoil\r\nthe broth. Apicius has been so thoroughly scrambled during the\r\nsixteen-hundred years preceding his first printing which started the\r\nscholars after him. So far, with the exception of a few minor\r\ninstances, they have done remarkably well. The complete unscrambling\r\ncan be done only by many new cooks, willing to devote much pain and\r\nunremunerative, careful, patient work in discovering new evidence and\r\nadding it to what there is already, to arrive at the truth of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 20, A.D. 1926-1936, CHICAGO\r\n\r\nApicius, J.

Nevertheless, a general outline of the\r\n  specific meanings of these terms may be gathered from observing the\r\n  nature of the several preparations listed under these headings,\r\n  particularly as follows: ---- ROSATUM, {Rx} 4; (cf.

Those who work there are CUISINIERS,\r\n  COCINEROS, the female a CUISINIÈRE, and so forth\r\n\r\n    The German and Swedish for \"kitchen\" are KÜCHE and KÖKET, but the\r\n  words \"cook\" and \"KOCH\" are directly related to COQUUS\r\n\r\n    A self-respecting Roman cook, especially a master of the art,\r\n  having charge of a crew, would assume the title of MAGIRUS, or\r\n  ARCHIMAGIRUS, chief cook. This Greek--\"MAGEIROS\"--plainly shows the\r\n  high regard in which Greek cookery stood in Rome. No American CHEF\r\n  would think of calling himself \"chief cook,\" although CHEF means\r\n  just that. The foreign word sounds ever so much better both in old\r\n  Rome and in new New York. MAGEIROS is derived from the Greek\r\n  equivalent of the verb \"to knead,\" which leads us to the art of\r\n  baking. Titles and distinctions were plentiful in the ancient\r\n  bakeshops, which plainly indicates departmentisation and division of\r\n  labor\r\n\r\n    The PISTOR was the baker of loaves, the DULCIARIUS the cake baker,\r\n  using honey for sweetening. Martial says of the PISTOR DULCIARIUS,\r\n  \"that hand will construct for you a thousand sweet figures of art;\r\n  for it the frugal bee principally labors.\" The PANCHESTRARIUS,\r\n  mentioned in Arnobius, is another confectioner. The LIBARIUS still\r\n  another of the sweet craft. The CRUSTULARIUS and BOTULARIUS were a\r\n  cookie baker and a sausage maker respectively\r\n\r\n    The LACTARIUS is the milkman; the PLACENTARIUS he who makes the\r\n  PLACENTA, a certain pancake, also a kind of cheese cake, often\r\n  presented during the Saturnalia. The SCRIBLITARIUS belongs here,\r\n  too: in our modern parlance we would perhaps call these two\r\n  \"ENTREMETIERS.\" The SCRIBLITA must have been a sort of hot cake,\r\n  perhaps an omelet, a pancake, a dessert of some kind, served hot;\r\n  maybe just a griddle cake, baked on a hot stone, a TORTILLA--what's\r\n  the use of guessing! but SCRIBLITAE were good, for Plautus, in one\r\n  of his plays, Poenulus, shouts, \"Now, then, the SCRIBLITAE are\r\n  piping hot! Come hither, fellows!\" Not all of them did eat, however,\r\n  all the time, for Posidippus derides a cook, saying, CUM SIS COQUUS,\r\n  PROFECTUS EXTRA LIMEN ES, CUM NON PRIUS COENAVERIS, \"What? Thou art\r\n  a cook, and hast gone, without dinner, over the threshold?\"\r\n\r\n    From the FOCARIUS, the scullion, the FORNACARIUS, the fireman, or\r\n  furnace tender, and the CULINARIUS, the general kitchen helper to\r\n  the OBSONATOR, the steward, the FARTOR to the PRINCEPS COQUORUM, the\r\n  \"maître d'hôtel\" of the establishment we see an organization very\r\n  much similar to our own in any well-conducted kitchen\r\n\r\n    The Roman cooks, formerly slaves in the frugal days of the nation,\r\n  rose to great heights of civic importance with the spread of\r\n  civilization and the advance of luxury in the empire. Cf. \"The Rôle\r\n  of the Mageiroi in the Life of the Ancient Greeks\" by E. M. Rankin,\r\n  Chic., 1907, and \"Roman Cooks\" by C. G.

The intestines\r\n  were exposed to the sun and fermented. This has stirred up\r\n  controversies; the ancients have been denounced for the \"vile\r\n  concoctions,\" but garum has been vindicated by modern science as to\r\n  its rational preparation and nutritive qualities. Codfish oil, for\r\n  instance, has long been known for its medicinal properties,\r\n  principally Vitamin D; this is being increased today by exposure to\r\n  ultraviolet rays (just what the ancients did). The intestines are\r\n  the most nutritious portions of fish\r\n\r\n    G. still remains a sort of mystery. Its exact mode of preparation is\r\n  not known. It was very popular and expensive, therefore was subject\r\n  to a great number of variations in quality and in price, and to\r\n  adulteration. For all these reasons GARUM has been the subject of\r\n  much speculation. It appears that the original meaning of G. became\r\n  entirely lost in the subsequent variations\r\n\r\n    In 1933 Dr. Margaret B. Wilson sent the author a bottle of GARUM\r\n  ROMANUM which she had compounded according to the formulae at her\r\n  disposal. This was a syrupy brown liquid, smelled like glue and had\r\n  to be dissolved in water or wine, a few drops of the G. to a glass\r\n  of liquid, of which, in turn, only a few drops were used to flavor a\r\n  fish sauce, etc.\r\n\r\n    ---- SOCIORUM, the best kind of G.; ALEXGARI VITIUM, the cheap kind\r\n  of G., cf.

The term \"croquette\" used by Gollmer does not fully\r\n  cover H.; some indeed, resemble modern croquettes and kromeskis very\r\n  closely. The ancients, having no table forks and only a few knives\r\n  (which were for the servants' use in carving) were fond of such\r\n  preparations as could be partaken of without table ware. The\r\n  reclining position at table made it almost necessary for them to eat\r\n  H.; such dishes gave the cooks an opportunity for the display of\r\n  their skill, inventive ability, their decorative and artistic sense.\r\n  As \"predigested\" food, such dishes are decided preferable to the\r\n  \"_grosses-pièces_,\" which besides energetic mastication require\r\n  skillful manipulation of fork and knife; such exercise was unwelcome\r\n  on the Roman couches. Modern nations, featuring \"_grosses-pièces_\"\r\n  do this at the expense of high-class cookery. The word, H., is\r\n  probably a medieval graecification of INSICIUM. Cf.

Lister, {Rx} 50, p. 119, describes the sausage\r\n  and calls the inhabitants of Tarent \"most voluptuous, soft and\r\n  delicate\" because Juvenal, Sat. VI, v. 297, takes a shot at Tarent\r\n\r\n    This part of Italy, and especially Sicily, because in close contact\r\n  with Greece was for many years much farther advanced in art of\r\n  cookery than the North\r\n\r\n  Lucania, district of lower Italy whence came the Lucanian sausage,\r\n  p. 172, {Rx} 61; see also LONGANO\r\n\r\n  LUCIUS FLUVIALIS, a river fish, perch, or pike, according to some;\r\n  Platina also calls it LICIUS.

See also CITRUM\r\n\r\n    It is remarkable that Apicius does not specifically speak of lemons\r\n  and oranges, fruits that must have grown in Italy at his time, that\r\n  are so indispensable to modern cookery\r\n\r\n    MALUM PUNICUM, {Rx} 20, 21; ---- CYDONIUM, {Rx} 21; ---- GRANATUM,\r\n  {Rx} 20; ---- MEDICUM, {Rx} 24; ---- ROSEUM, {Rx} 178, 171. This name,\r\n  which according to Schuch simply stands for a rose-colored apple,\r\n  has led to the belief that the ancients made pies, etc., of roses.\r\n  Today a certain red-colored apple is known as \"Roman Beauty.\" We\r\n  concur in Schuch's opinion, remembering, however, that the fruit of\r\n  the rose tree, namely the hip, dog-briar, or eglantine, is made into\r\n  dainty confections on the Continent today. It is therefore quite\r\n  possible that MALUM ROSEUM stands for the fruit of the rose\r\n\r\n  MANDUCO, to chew, to munch, to enjoy food by munching; a glutton\r\n\r\n  MAPPA, table napkin (Fr. nappe). M. is a Punic word, according to\r\n  Quintil. 1, 5, 57\r\n\r\n    Each banquet guest brought with him from his own home such a napkin\r\n  or cloth which he used during the banquet to wipe his mouth and\r\n  hands. The ancients, evidently, were conscious of the danger of\r\n  infection through the common use of napkins and table ware.\r\n  Sometimes they used their napkins to wrap up part of the meal and to\r\n  give it to their slaves to carry home in. Horace, Martial, Petronius\r\n  attest to this fact. The banquet guests also employed their own\r\n  slaves to wait on them at their Host's party. This custom and the\r\n  individual napkin habit have survived until after the French\r\n  revolution. Grimod de la Reynière, in his Almanach des Gourmands,\r\n  Paris, 1803, seq., describes how guests furnished their own napkins\r\n  and servants for their own use at parties to which they were invited\r\n\r\n    This rather sensible custom relieved the host of much responsibility\r\n  and greatly assisted him in defraying the expenses of the dinner. On\r\n  the other hand it reveals the restrictions placed upon any host by\r\n  the general shortage of table ware, table linen, laundering\r\n  facilities in the days prior to the mechanical age\r\n\r\n  Marcellus, a Roman physician, {Rx} 29\r\n\r\n  Marinade, pickle; a composition of spices, vegetables, herbs, and\r\n  liquids, such as vinegar, wine, to preserve meats for several days\r\n  and to impart to it a special flavor, {Rx} 11, 236, 244, 394; cf.\r\n  EMBAMMA\r\n\r\n  MARJORANA, marjoram\r\n\r\n  Marmites, illustrated, pp. 264, 284, 312, 342\r\n\r\n  MARRUBIUM, the plant horehound\r\n\r\n  Martial, writer, p. 10, {Rx} 307, 461 (on bulbs)\r\n\r\n  Martino, Maestro, p. 3, cf.

MERULA); he pronounces their\r\n  flesh to be \"devilish.\" \"STURNI, QUOS VULGO DIABOLICAM CARNEM HABERE\r\n  DICIMUS.\" Yet three-hundred years later, French authorities\r\n  recommend this sort of food. Viger, La Nouvelle Maison Rustique,\r\n  Paris, 1798, Vol. iii, p. 613, tells how to catch and fatten STURNI.\r\n  \"After a month [of forced feeding] they will be nice and fat and\r\n  good to eat and to sell; there are persons who live of this trade.\"\r\n  He praises the crow similarly\r\n\r\n    These instances are cited not only as a commentary upon the taste of\r\n  the Southern people and their habits which have endured to this day\r\n  but also to illustrate the singular genius of Platina. Also the\r\n  following notes to STYRIO tend to show how far advanced was Platina\r\n  in the matter of food as compared with the masters of the 18th\r\n  century in France\r\n\r\n  STYRIO, STIRIO, STURIO, {Rx} 145, sturgeon; probably the same fish\r\n  as known to the ancients as ACIPENSER or STURIO. (A. SIVE S. OBLONGO\r\n  TEREDEQUE--Stephanus à Schonevelde, in Ichthyologia, Hamburg, 1624).\r\n  There can be no doubt that the sturgeon or sterlet is meant by this\r\n  term, for Platina calls the eggs of the fish \"caviare.\" \"OVA\r\n  STIRIONIS CONDITUM QUOD CAUARE UOCANT.\" Eloquently he describes his\r\n  struggle with the changing language. The efforts of this\r\n  conscientious man, Platina, to get at the bottom of things no matter\r\n  how trivial they may appear, are highly praiseworthy\r\n\r\n    He writes \"DE STIRIONE. TRAHI PER TENEBRAS N{=U}C MIHI VIDEOR,\r\n  QUANDO HOR{=U}, DE QUIBUS, DEINCEPS DICTURUS SUM, PISCI{=U}, NULLUS\r\n  CERTUS UEL NOMINIS, UEL NATURAE EXISTAT AUTOR.

VTAR EGO NOUIS\r\n  NOMINIBUS NE DELICATORUM GULAE PER ME DICANT STETISSE, QUO MINUS\r\n  INTEGRA UTERENTUR UOLUPTATE.\"\r\n\r\n    As for the rest, Platina cooks the sturgeon precisely in our own\r\n  modern way: namely in water, white wine and vinegar. And: \"SALEM\r\n  INDERE MEMENTO!--don't forget the salt!\"\r\n\r\n    Compare him with France 350 years later. As for caviare, A.\r\n  Beauvilliers, in his L'Art du cuisinier, Paris, 1814, treats this\r\n  \"ragoût\" as something entirely new; yet Beauvilliers was the leading\r\n  restaurateur of his time and a very capable cook, save Carême, the\r\n  best. Beauvilliers has no use for caviare which he calls \"Kavia.\"\r\n  Says he: \"LES RUSSES EN FONT UN GRAND CAS ET L'ACHETENT FORT CHER\r\n  [The Russians make a big thing of this and buy it very dearly] CE\r\n  RAGOUT, SELON MOI, NE CONVIENT QU' AUX RUSSES--this stew, according\r\n  to my notion, suits only the Russians or those who have traveled\r\n  thereabouts.\"\r\n\r\n    Shakespeare, in speaking about \"Caviare to the General\" apparently\r\n  was more up-to-date in culinary matters than this Parisian\r\n  authority. A search of the eight volumes (Vol. I, 1803) of the\r\n  famous Almanach des Gourmands by Grimod de la Reynière, Paris, 1803,\r\n  seq., fails to reveal a trace of caviare\r\n\r\n    A German cook, a hundred years after Platina, Marx Rumpolt in \"Ein\r\n  new Kochbuch, Franckfort am Mayn, bey Johan Feyrabendt, 1587\" on\r\n  verso of folio XCVII, No. 9, gives an exact description of caviare\r\n  and its mode of preparation. He calls it ROGEN VOM HAUSEN. The\r\n  HAUSEN is the real large sturgeon, the Russian Beluga from which the\r\n  best caviare is obtained. Rumpolt, whose book is the finest and most\r\n  thorough of its kind in the middle ages, and a great work in every\r\n  respect, remarks that caviare is good eating, especially for\r\n  Hungarian gentlemen\r\n\r\n    \"...

Since it appears\r\n    deliberate, it has been preserved as printed.\r\n\r\n    Page 9 has a word obscured--\"one of three known famous\r\n    ---- bearing that name\". Another source of the text has\r\n    the word as 'eaters', so the same has been used here.\r\n\r\n    Page 23 has a reference to a \"modern\" sauce, A I. There\r\n    were no obvious references to be found for a sauce of\r\n    that name, so it may be a typo for A1 sauce, which was\r\n    available at the time of writing. As there is no way to\r\n    be certain, however, it has been preserved as printed.\r\n\r\n    Page 49--note to recipe 13 reads, \"Exactly as we today\r\n    with fried herring and river lamprey\". It is possible\r\n    that it should read \"as we do today\", but has been left\r\n    as printed.\r\n\r\n    Page 151--recipe 241 has a note 1, but no marker in the\r\n    text.\r\n\r\n    Page 166--recipe 275 has a marker for note 1, but no\r\n    note with that number.\r\n\r\n    Page 172--Note 1 to recipe 294 reads \"making it convenient\r\n    and unprofitable for the domestic cook\"--this should\r\n    probably be read as \"inconvenient and unprofitable\",\r\n    but it has been left as printed.\r\n\r\n    Page 175--recipe 305 has a marker for note 2, but no\r\n    note with that number.\r\n\r\n    Page 189--recipe 351 has a marker for note 2, but no\r\n    note with that number.\r\n\r\n    Page 211--recipe 405a has a marker for note 2, but no\r\n    note with that number.\r\n\r\n    Page 226--there is no title for recipe 445.\r\n\r\n    Page 230--there is no Latin translation provided for the\r\n    heading \"EEL\".\r\n\r\n    Page 243--recipe 481 is titled \"FISH STEWED IN WINE\",\r\n    but does not mention wine anywhere in the recipe itself.\r\n\r\n    Page 284--contained incorrectly placed index entries for\r\n    CLIBANUS, CNICOS and CNISSA (following COXA).
