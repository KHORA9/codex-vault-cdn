She carried the lovers proposals to the family of his\r\nmistress, or rather, perhaps, broke the ice and paved the way for him.\r\nIn the earlier ages men, no doubt, performed this delicate office\r\nthemselves, or entrusted it to their parents; as in Homer we find\r\nAchilles declaring, that his father Peleus shall choose a wife for him.\r\nEarlier still, if we may credit certain prevalent traditions, men\r\ndispensed altogether with such preliminaries and lived “more pecudum”\r\nwith the first females who came in their way; a state of barbarism from\r\nwhich it is said they were reclaimed by Cecrops.[2] But, to whomsoever\r\nthis fable may trace its origin, it is evidently unworthy of the\r\nslightest credit. Of times sunk in such an abyss of ignorance no record\r\ncould remain, or even of many succeeding revolutions of manners touching\r\nclose upon the orbit of civilisation. If, however, the tradition arose\r\noriginally out of any real innovation in manners, it may refer to the\r\npartial abolition of polygamy, which, whether made by Cecrops or not,\r\nwas an important step in the progress of the Greeks towards polished\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Προμνηστρία. Aristoph. Nub. 41. et Schol. Poll. iii. 41.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 2. Mr. Mitford defers too much to “the traditions\r\n  received in the polished ages” when, upon the authority of such\r\n  traditions and of such writers as Justin (ii. 6.), he appears to\r\n  conclude that, before the time of Cecrops, the people of Attica were\r\n  in knowledge and civilisation inferior to the wildest savages. Hist,\r\n  of Greece, i. 58. Upon legends and authors of this description no\r\n  reliance can be placed. If society existed, everything “indispensable”\r\n  to society also existed; therefore, if marriage be so, it could not be\r\n  unknown. Besides, how happens it that this same Cecrops who instituted\r\n  marriage did not likewise teach them to sow corn, which, if Egypt was,\r\n  when he left it, a civilised country, must have been as familiar to\r\n  him as matrimony? This most necessary acquisition, however, they were\r\n  left to make many ages afterwards, during the reign of Erechtheus.\r\n  Justin, ii. 6.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut if Cecrops ever lived, and should not be regarded as a mere\r\nmythological creation, we must still reject the comparatively modern\r\ntradition which fetches him from Egypt. Coming from the East, he would\r\nmore probably have instituted polygamy than the contrary. In every point\r\nof view the tradition is absurd; for it at once represents the people of\r\nAttica as savages, and as having made considerable advances in the\r\nscience of civil government. They have already emerged from the state of\r\npatriarchal rule, not by any means the lowest, and have arrived at the\r\nmonarchical period in the history of society—for Cecrops marries the\r\ndaughter of king Actæos—yet have not made the first step in\r\nrefinement,[3] have not passed the barrier dividing the rudest savage\r\nfrom even the barbarian,—had not made the discovery that, for the\r\npreservation of society, children must be cared for and maintained,\r\nwhich is impossible until they have other fathers than the community. We\r\nmust, therefore, reject this Cecropian legend, and acknowledge that,\r\nfrom the earliest times of which any record remains, the people of\r\nHellas married and were given in marriage.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Goguet, Origine des Lois. iv. 394, where the learned author\r\n  contends most chivalrously for the received theory. Apollodorus,\r\n  however, represents Cecrops as an Autochthon, συμφύες ἔχων σῶμα ἀνδρὸς\r\n  καὶ δράκοντος. iii. 14. 1.—The reason why he was thus said to partake\r\n  of two natures—half-man and half-snake—has been very variously and\r\n  very fantastically explained. Diodorus Siculus, (i. p. 17,) derives\r\n  his title to be considered half a man and half a beast, from his\r\n  being, by choice a Greek, by nature a barbarian. Yet he conceives that\r\n  it was the beast that civilised the man. Others explain διφυὴς\r\n  somewhat differently to mean that he was of gigantic stature and\r\n  understood two languages: διὰ μῆκος σώματος οὑτω καλούμενος, ὅς φήσιν\r\n  ὁ Φιλόχορος, ἢ ὅτι Αἰγυπτίων τὰς δύο γλώσσας ἠπίστατο.—Euseb. No.\r\n  460.—Eustathius, familiar with the fables of the mythology, turns the\r\n  tables upon Cecrops, and conceives that he may have civilised himself,\r\n  not the Athenians, by settling in Attica. He supposes him ἀπὸ ὄφεως\r\n  εἰς ἀνθρωπὸν ἐλθειν, ἐπειδὴ ἐκεῖνος ἐλθὼν εἰς Ἑλλάδα καὶ τὸν βάρβαρον\r\n  Αἰγυπτιασμὸν ἀφεις, χρηστοὺς ἀναλάβετο τρόπους πολιτικοὺς.—In Dionys.\r\n  Peneg. p. 56.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhatever the original practice of the Greeks may have been, traces of\r\npolygamy long continued discernible in their manners. Heracles\r\nmaintained a seraglio worthy of an Ottoman sultan. His wives, indeed,\r\nlike those of a wandering Brahmin, were scattered at convenient points\r\nover the country, that, whithersoever he roamed, he might find lodging\r\nand entertainment; but, as rumours of his different establishments\r\ntravelled about, the jealousy of the ladies was at last excited and\r\nproved fatal to him. Ægeus, too, and his brother Pallas, old Priam,\r\nAgamemnon, Theseus, and nearly every public man in the heroic times, are\r\nrepresented as possessing a harem. Indeed, to judge by the practice of\r\nprinces, it would seem as if polygamy were the law of every land; so\r\nhabitual is it with them to transgress, in this point, against public\r\nopinion. A report, still current among certain writers, represents\r\nSocrates with two wives, the gentle nature of Xantippe encouraging him,\r\nperhaps, to venture on a second! But even that diligent retailer of\r\nscandal, Athenæus,[4] rejects this story, which, no doubt, originated\r\nwith some sophist, who owed the philosopher a grudge. If not in the son\r\nof Sophroniscos, however, at least in Philip of Macedon, the kings of\r\nheroic times found an exact imitator. This Pellæan fox, though he did\r\nnot, like the Persian monarch, lead about with him an army of concubines\r\nin his military expeditions, yet, from policy or other motives,\r\ncontracted numerous marriages, as many, perhaps, as Heracles. Satyros\r\nhas bequeathed to us a curious account of his majesty’s matrimonial\r\nexploits. During his long reign, of from twenty to four-and-twenty\r\nyears, the dishes of one nuptial feast had scarcely time to cool before\r\na new one was in preparation. It was nothing but truffles and rich soup\r\nfrom June till June. I am unable to furnish a list of all the ladies who\r\nclaimed, through Philip’s diffusive love, to be queens of Macedon; but\r\nit may be proper to name a few, to show how the morals of his subjects\r\nmust have been improved by his example. The first lady whose landed\r\nattractions won Philip’s heart was _Andatè_, an Illyrian, by whom he had\r\na daughter, called Cynna. To her succeeded _Phila_, sister of Derda and\r\nMacatè. His next wives were two Thessalian women, _Pherè_ of\r\nNikesipolis, mother of Thessalonia, and _Philinna_ of Larissa, mother of\r\nAridæos. Had he sought merely the women these might have sufficed; but\r\nPhilip had other views, and, finding marriage a still more expeditious\r\nmethod of extending his dominions even than conquest, he forthwith added\r\nto the list _Olympias_, who brought him the kingdom of Molossia in\r\ndowry, and, as every one knows, was mother of Alexander. Had the crafty\r\nprince stopped here, posterity, overlooking his immorality, might have\r\napplauded his prudence. But, elated by success, he proceeded to augment\r\nthe number of his queens. To Olympias succeeded _Meda_, daughter of\r\nCithalas, king of Thrace; and, lastly, _Cleopatra_, sister of\r\nHippostratos, and niece of Attalos. By this time he was somewhat\r\nadvanced in years, for Alexander, son of Olympias, approached manhood.\r\nAt the feast given in honour of this new marriage, when the wine had\r\ncirculated, as was customary among Macedonians, Attalos, who had\r\nprobably drunk deep, observed, “At length we shall have legitimate\r\nprinces, not bastards!” Alexander, who was present, in resentment of the\r\naffront, threw his goblet in the face of Attalos, who saluted him in the\r\nsame way. Upon this, perceiving how matters were likely to proceed,\r\nOlympias fled to Molossia, Alexander into Illyria. Philip lived to have\r\nby Cleopatra one daughter, Europa; but, shortly afterwards, at the\r\ninstigation, it is supposed of Olympias and Alexander, was murdered by\r\nPausanias.[5]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Deipnosoph. xiii. 2.—Compare the account in Diogenes Laertius, ii. 5.\r\n  10.—The conduct of Socrates, who married Xantippe to prove the\r\n  goodness of his temper, was imitated, we are told, by a Christian\r\n  lady, who “desired of St. Athanasius to procure for her, out of the\r\n  widows fed from the ecclesiastical corban, an old woman morose,\r\n  peevish, and impatient, that she might by the society of so ungentle a\r\n  person have often occasion to exercise her patience, her forgiveness,\r\n  and charity.”—Jeremy Taylor’s Life of Christ, i. 384.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOrdinary individuals, however, were restrained from the commission of\r\nsuch immoralities by the laws, more particularly at Athens, where\r\nmarriage was contemplated with all the reverence due to the great\r\npalladium of civilisation. As a necessary consequence, celibacy could be\r\nno other than disreputable, so that, to a man ambitious of public\r\nhonour, the possession of a wife and children was no less indispensable\r\nthan the means of living.[6] Among the Spartans, bachelors were\r\ndelivered over to the tender mercies of the women, and subjected to very\r\nheavy penalties. During the celebration of certain festivals they were\r\nseized by a crowd of petulant viragoes, each able to strangle an ox,[7]\r\nand dragged in derision round the altars of the gods, receiving from the\r\nfists of their gentle tormentors such blows as the regular practice of\r\nboxing had taught the young ladies to inflict.[8]\r\n\r\n               “And ladies sometimes hit exceeding hard.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Dinarch. in Demosth. § 11. Cf. Poll. viii. 40. Comm. p. 644.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph. Lysistrat. 78, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut we shall be the less inclined to judge uncharitably of this somewhat\r\nunfeminine custom, if we consider that, in the ancient world, no less\r\nthan in the modern, unmarried and childless women were held but in\r\nslight esteem. And this feeling, which never for a moment slumbers in\r\nsociety, teaches better than the cant of a thousand sentimentalists what\r\nthe true origin of love is.\r\n\r\nOf the impediments to marriage arising, among ancient nations, from\r\nrelationship or consanguinity, very little is with certainty known. In\r\nthe heroic ages, all unions excepting those of parents with their\r\nchildren appear to have been lawful; for, in the Odyssey, we find the\r\nsix sons of Æolos joined in marriage with their six sisters, the manners\r\nof the olden times, abandoned on earth, still lingering among the gods.\r\n\r\nIphidamos has to wife his mother’s sister,[9] and Alcinoös, by no means\r\na profligate or immoral prince, is united with his brother’s\r\ndaughter;[10] Deiphobos, after Paris’s death, takes possession of\r\nHelen,[11] and Helenos, the seer, is united in wedlock with Andromache,\r\nthe widow of his brother Hector.[12] But without alleging any further\r\nexamples, we may, from the practice imputed to the gods, among whom\r\nscarcely any degree of relationship was a bar to marriage, infer that,\r\nin very early ages, few scruples were entertained upon the subject.\r\nLater mythologists have even imputed to Zeus an illicit amour with his\r\ndaughter Aphrodite,[13] but libellously, and in contradiction to the\r\nbest ancient authorities.[14] Nature, indeed, has so peremptorily\r\nprohibited the union of parents with their own children, that positive\r\nlaws forbidding connexions so nefarious, have in all ages been nearly\r\nunnecessary, though the superstition of the Magi[15] in ancient, and the\r\nprofligacy of popes and princes in modern times, have been accused of\r\ntransgressing these natural boundaries.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Hom.

Laert. Proœm. § 6. To this practice Euripides probably alludes\r\n  in the Andromache, v. 173, sqq., where Hermione describes, with scorn,\r\n  the profligate manners of the barbarians. Catullus, inveighing against\r\n  the impious depravity of a contemporary, observes—\r\n\r\n              “Nam Magus ex matre et gnato gignatur oportet,\r\n              Si vera est Persarum _impia religio_.”\r\n\r\n  Epig. lxxxiii. 3, seq.

The Spartan\r\nlaw took a different view of what constitutes sisterhood. Here the\r\nfather was everything, and therefore with an uterine sister, as no near\r\nrelation, marriage might be contracted.[20] All connexions in the direct\r\nline of ascent or descent were prohibited; but the prohibition extended\r\nnot to the collateral branches,[21] uncles being permitted to take to\r\nwife their nieces, and nephews their aunts.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

It was, in fact, thought to\r\nextend to the age of thirty-five or thirty-seven, more or less: when\r\nentering upon the less flowery domain of manhood, men would need the aid\r\nand consolation of a helpmate. But if there ever existed such a law it\r\nwas often broken,[23] for early marriages, though less common perhaps\r\nthan in modern times, are constantly alluded to both by historians and\r\npoets. Apprehensions of the too great increase of population already led\r\nphilosophers, even in those early ages, vainly to apply themselves to\r\nthe discovery of checks, which the irresistible impulses of nature\r\nalways render nugatory; and viewing in that light the regulation\r\nattributed to Solon,[24] they, with some variation, adopt it in their\r\npolitical works. Plato,[25] in accordance with Hesiod’s notion, fixes\r\nfor the male, the marriageable age at thirty; but Aristotle, who chose\r\non most points to differ from his master, allows his citizens seven\r\nyears more of liberty. For women the proper age, he thought, is about\r\neighteen. His reasons are, that the husband and wife will thus flourish\r\nand decay together; and, their offspring inheriting the bloom and\r\nhighest vigour of their parents, be at once[26] healthy in body and\r\nenergetic in mind.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  Censor. de Die Natal. 14.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Thus Mantitheos, in Demosthenes, marries at the age of eighteen, in\r\n  obedience to his father’s wishes.—Contr.

For this notion several\r\nphysiological reasons are assigned; as that, during the prevalence of\r\nthat wind, the human frame is peculiarly nervous and full of energy;\r\nthat the spirits are consequently light, and the temper and disposition\r\nsweet, cheerful, and flexible. Lingering sparks of ancient superstition\r\nmay also have had their share in establishing this persuasion: towards\r\nthat quarter of the heavens, as towards an universal _Kebleh_, all the\r\ncivilised nations of antiquity turned as the home of their gods; in that\r\ndirection point all the openings of the Egyptian pyramids; thither to\r\nthe present moment turn the Chinese and Brahmins when they pray, and in\r\nthe holy tabernacle of the Jews the Table of Shewbread[28] likewise\r\nfaced the north. Attention, too, was paid to the lunar influences; for,\r\nno other circumstance preventing it, it was usual to fix on the full of\r\nthe moon, when the festival denominated _Theogamia_, or “Nuptials of the\r\nGods” was celebrated, in order that religion itself, by its august and\r\nvenerable ceremonies, might appear to sanctify the union of mortals\r\neffected under its auspices.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Olympiod. in Meteor. c. 6.

We must, nevertheless, beware that we\r\ninfer not too much from these gifts; for equally primitive and prevalent\r\nwas the custom imposing upon fathers the necessity of dowrying their\r\ndaughters.[32] In the case, too, of the husband’s death this matrimonial\r\nportion devolved to the children, so that if the widow chose,—as widows\r\nsometimes will,[33]—to embark a second time on the connubial sea, her\r\nfather was called upon to furnish a fresh outfit. But, if the husband\r\ngrew tired of his better half, and would insist on a divorce, or if,\r\nafter his death, the sons were sufficiently unnatural to chase their\r\nmother from the paternal roof, the right over the entire dowry reverted\r\nto her.[34]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  Aristot.

And\r\nyoung women, whose parents no longer survived, were settled in marriage\r\nby their brothers, grandfathers, or guardians. Husbands on their\r\ndeathbeds sometimes disposed of the hands of their wives, as in the case\r\nof Demosthenes’ father, who bequeathed Cleobula to Aphobos, whom he\r\nlikewise appointed guardian of his children. In this instance, the widow\r\nhad better have chosen for herself. Aphobos possessed himself of the\r\ndowry, and consented to fulfil the office of guardian, that he might\r\nplunder the children; but the marriage he declined. Another example\r\noccurs in the case of Phormio who, having been slave[35] to an opulent\r\ncitizen, and conducted himself with zeal and fidelity, received at once\r\nhis freedom and the widow of his master. In all serious matters the\r\nAthenians were a very methodical people, and conducted everything, even\r\nto the betrothing or marrying of a wife, with an attention to form\r\nworthy the quaintest citizen of our own great city.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  Demosth. pro Phorm. § 8–10.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPotter observes, with great naïveté, that, before men married, it was\r\ncustomary to provide themselves with a house to live in. The custom was\r\na good one, and the thrifty old poet of Ascra, undertaking to enlighten\r\nhis countrymen in economics, is explicit on the point—\r\n\r\n         “First build your house and let the wife succeed:”[36]\r\n\r\nwhich, no doubt, is better advice than if he had said “first marry a\r\nwife and next consider where you shall put her.” And we find that, even\r\namong pastoral, young ladies who, in modern poets, make their meat and\r\ndrink of love, and hang up a rag or two of it to preserve them from the\r\nelements, in antiquity posed their lovers with interrogations about\r\ncomforts. “You are very pressing, my dear Daphnis, and swear you love\r\nme; but that is not just now the question. Have you a house and harem to\r\ntake me to?”[37]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  Opera et Dies, 405.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  Theocrit. Eidyll. xxvii. 36.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut prudent as they may be considered, the Athenians were still more\r\npious than thrifty. Before the virgin quitted her childhood’s home, and\r\npassed from the state she had tried, and in most cases, perhaps, found\r\nhappy, to enter into one altogether unknown to her, custom demanded the\r\nperformance, on the day before the marriage, of several religious\r\nceremonies eminently significant and beautiful. Hitherto, in the\r\npoetical recesses of their thalamoi, they had been reckoned as so many\r\nnymphs attached to the train of the virgin goddess of the woods. About\r\nto become members of a noviciate more conformable to nature than that of\r\nthe Catholic church, they deemed it incumbent on them to implore their\r\nDivinity’s permission to transfer their worship from her to Hymen; and,\r\nthe more readily to obtain it, they approached her, in the simplicity of\r\ntheir hearts, with baskets full of offerings such as it became them to\r\npresent and her to receive.[38] Nor was Artemis the only deity sought,\r\non this occasion, to be rendered auspicious by sacrifice and prayer.\r\nOfferings were likewise made to the Nymphs, those lovely creations with\r\nwhich the fancy of the Greeks peopled the streams and fountains of their\r\nnative land.[39] These rites performed, the future bride was conducted\r\nin pomp to the citadel, where solemn sacrifice was offered up to Athena,\r\nthe tutelar goddess of the state, with prayers for happiness, peculiarly\r\nthe gift of supreme wisdom.[40] To Hera, also, and the Fates,[41] as to\r\nthe goddesses that watched over the connubial state and rigidly punished\r\nthose who transgressed its sacred laws, were gifts presented, and vows\r\npreferred; and on one or all of their several altars did the maiden\r\ndeposit a lock of her own hair, in remoter ages, perhaps, the whole of\r\nit, to intimate that, having obtained a husband, she must preserve him\r\nby other means than beauty, and the arts of the toilette.[42] At Megara\r\nthe young women devoted their severed locks to Iphinoë. Those of Delos\r\nto Hecaerga and Ops,[43] while, like the Athenians, the maidens of Argos\r\nperformed this rite in honour of Athena.[44]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  Theocrit.

An auspicious day having been fixed upon,\r\nthe relations and friends of both parties assembled in magnificent\r\napparel, at the house of the bride’s father, where all the ladies of the\r\nfamily were busily engaged in the recitation of prayers and presentation\r\nof offerings. These domestic ceremonies concluded, the bride,\r\naccompanied by her paranymph or bridesmaid, was led forth into the\r\nstreet by the bridegroom and one of his most intimate friends,[45] who\r\nplaced her between them in an open carriage.[46] Their dresses, as was\r\nfitting, were of the richest and most splendid kind. Those of the\r\nbridegroom full, flowing, and of the gayest and brightest colours,[47]\r\nglittered with golden ornaments, and diffused around, as he moved, a\r\ncloud of perfume. The bride herself, gifted with that unerring taste\r\nwhich distinguished her nation, appeared in a costume at once simple and\r\nmagnificent—simple in its contour, its masses, its folds, magnificent\r\nfrom the brilliance of its hues and the superb and costly style of its\r\nornaments. She was not, like some modern court dame, a blaze of precious\r\nstones tastelessly heaped upon each other; but through the snowy gauze\r\nof her veil flashed the jewelled fillet and coronet-like sphendone\r\nwhich, with a chaplet of flowers,[48] adorned her dark tresses; and\r\nbetween the folds of her robe of gold-embroidered purple, appeared her\r\ngloveless fingers, with many rings glittering with gems. Strings of Red\r\nSea pearls encircled her neck and arms; pendants, variously wrought and\r\ndropped with Indian jewels, twinkled in her ears; and her feet, partly\r\nconcealed by the falling robe, displayed a portion of the golden thonged\r\nsandal, crusted with emeralds, rubies, or pearls. But all these\r\nornaments often failed to distract the eye from those which she owed to\r\nnature. Her luxuriant hair, which in Eastern women often reaches the\r\nground:\r\n\r\n                Her hair in hyacinthine flow,\r\n                When left to roll its folds below,\r\n                As ’midst her maidens in the ball\r\n                She stood superior to them all,\r\n                Hath swept the marble, where her feet\r\n                Gleamed whiter than the mountain sleet,\r\n                Ere from the cloud that gave it birth\r\n                It fell and caught one stain of earth;\r\n\r\nher hair, I say, perfumed with delicate unguents,[49] such as nard from\r\nTarsos, œranthe from Cypros, essence of roses from Cyrene, of lilies\r\nfrom Ægina or Cilicia, fell loosely in a profusion of ringlets over her\r\nshoulders, while in front it was confined by the fillet and grasshoppers\r\nof gold.[50] More perishable ornaments, in the shape of crowns of\r\nmyrtle, wild thyme,[51] poppy, white sesame, with other flowers and\r\nplants sacred to Aphrodite, adorned the heads of both bride and\r\nbridegroom.[52]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Πάροχος.

A crow appearing\r\nsingly was supposed to betoken sorrow or separation, whereas, a couple\r\nof crows,[54] issuing from the proper quarter of the heavens, presaged\r\nperfect union and happiness. A pair of turtle doves, of all omens, was\r\nesteemed the best.[55]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  Charit. Char. et Callir.

Prayers were\r\nthen addressed to Zeus and his consort, the supreme divinities of\r\nOlympos;[58] nor, on this occasion, would they overlook the ancient\r\ngods, Ouranos and Gaia, whose union produces fertility and\r\nabundance,[59]—the Graces, whose smile shed upon life its sweetest\r\ncharm, and the Fates, who shorten or extend it at their pleasure, were\r\nnext in order adored; and, lastly, Aphrodite, the mother of Love, and of\r\nall the host of Heaven, the most beautiful and beneficent to\r\nmortals.[60] The victim having been opened, the gall was taken out and\r\nsignificantly cast behind the altar.[61] Soothsayers skilled in\r\ndivination then inspected the entrails, and if their appearance was\r\nalarming the nuptials were broken off, or deferred. When favourable, the\r\nrites proceeded as if hallowed by the smile of the gods. The bride now\r\ncut off one of her tresses, which, twisting round a spindle, she placed\r\nas an offering on the altar of Athena, while, in imitation of Theseus,\r\nthe bridegroom made a similar oblation to Apollo, bound, as an emblem of\r\nhis out-door life, round a handful of grass or herbs.[62] All the other\r\ngods, protectors of marriage, were then, by the parents or friends,\r\ninvoked in succession, and the rites thus completed, the virgin’s\r\nfather, placing the hand of the bridegroom in that of the bride, said,\r\n“I bestow on thee my daughter, that thine eyes may be gladdened by\r\nlegitimate offspring.”[63] The oath of inviolable fidelity was now taken\r\nby both, and the ceremony concluded with fresh sacrifices.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  Theod.

This hour, indeed, according to some, was\r\nchosen to conceal the blushes of the youthful wife.[64] And now\r\ncommenced the secular portion of the ceremony. Numerous attendants,\r\nbearing lighted torches,[65] ran in front of the procession, while bands\r\nof merry youths dancing, singing, or playing on musical instruments,\r\nsurrounded the nuptial car. Similar in this respect was the practice\r\nthroughout Greece, even so early as the time of Homer, who thus, in his\r\ndescription of the Shield, calls up before our imagination the lively\r\npicture of an heroic nuptial procession:\r\n\r\n           “Here sacred pomp and genial feasts delight,\r\n           And solemn dance and Hymeneal rite.\r\n           Along the streets the new-made brides are led,\r\n           With torches flaming, to the nuptial bed.\r\n           The youthful dancers in a circle bound\r\n           To the soft flute and cittern’s silver sound.[66]\r\n           Through the fair streets the matrons, in a row,\r\n           Stand in their porches and enjoy the show.”[67]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  Potter, Arch.

Pope’s Translation.\r\n\r\nThe song on this occasion sung received the name of the “Carriage\r\nMelody,” from the carriage in which the married pair rode while it was\r\nchaunted.[68]\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  Ἁρμάτειον μέλος. Leisner, in his notes on Bos (Antiq. Græc. Pars. iv.\r\n  c. ii. § 4.), observes, that in Suidas, Hesychius, and Eustathius (ad\r\n  Il. χ. p. 1380. 5), these words have a different meaning from that\r\n  which, with Bos and Potter (Antiq. Græc. ii. 282), I have adopted. But\r\n  in the passage quoted by Henri de Valois (ad Harpocrat. p. 222), they\r\n  would seem to bear the signification above given them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe house of the bridegroom, diligently prepared for their reception,\r\nwas decorated profusely with garlands, and brilliantly lighted up. When,\r\namong the Bœotians, the lady, accompanied by her husband, had descended\r\nfrom the carriage, its axletree was burnt, to intimate that having found\r\na home she would have no further use for it.[69] The celebration of\r\nnuptial rites generally puts people in good temper, at least for the\r\nfirst day; and new-married women at Athens stood in full need of all\r\nthey could muster to assist them through the crowd of ceremonies which\r\nbeset the entrances to the houses of their husbands. Symbols of domestic\r\nlabours, pestles, sieves,[70] and so on, met the young wife’s eye on all\r\nsides. She herself, in all her pomp of dress, bore in her hands an\r\nearthen barley-parcher.[71] But, to comfort her, very nice cakes of\r\nsesamum,[72] with wine and fruit and other dainties innumerable,\r\naccompanied by gleeful and welcoming faces, appeared in the background\r\nbeyond the sieves and pestles. The hymeneal lay,[73] with sundry other\r\nsongs, all redolent of “joy and youth,” resounded through halls now her\r\nown. Mirth and delight ushered her into the banqueting-room, where\r\nappeared a boy covered with thorn branches, and oaken boughs laden with\r\nacorns, who, when the epithalamium chaunters had ceased, recited an\r\nancient hymn beginning with the words, “I have escaped the worse and\r\nfound the better.”[74] This hymn, constituting a portion of the divine\r\nservice performed by the Athenians during a festival instituted in\r\ncommemoration of the discovery of corn, by which men were delivered from\r\nacorn-eating, they introduced among the nuptial ceremonies to intimate,\r\nthat wedlock is as much superior to celibacy as wheat is to mast. At the\r\nclose of the recitation, there entered a troop of dancing girls crowned\r\nwith myrtle-wreaths, and habited in light tunics reaching very little\r\nbelow the knee, just as we still behold them on antique gems and vases,\r\nwho, by their varied, free, and somewhat wanton, movements, vividly\r\nrepresented all the warmth and energy of passion.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

Both\r\nsexes partook of it; but, in conformity with the general spirit of their\r\nmanners and institutions, the ladies, as in Egypt, sat at separate\r\ntables.[75] At these entertainments we may infer that, among other good\r\nthings, great quantities of sweetmeats were consumed, since the woman\r\nemployed in kneading and preparing them, and in officiating at the\r\nnuptial sacrifices, was deemed of sufficient importance to possess a\r\ndistinct appellation, (δημιουργὸς,)[76] while the bride-cake, which\r\ndoubtless was the crowning achievement of her art, received the name of\r\nGamelios. The general arrangement of the banquet, however, they\r\nentrusted to the care of a sort of major-domo, who received the\r\nappellation of Trapezopoios.[77]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  Luc.

They were then introduced into the\r\nbanqueting-hall, where the first article set before them on taking their\r\nplaces at the board was, no doubt, exceedingly agreeable, consisting of\r\na silver beaker presented to each as a gift, which, when they had\r\ndrained off, they delivered to their attendant slaves, who, according to\r\nthe custom of the country, stood behind their seats with large baskets\r\nintended to contain the presents to be bestowed on them by the master of\r\nthe feast.[80] There was then placed before every member of the company\r\na bronze salver, of Corinthian workmanship, completely covered by a\r\ncake, on which were piled roast fowls and ducks and woodcocks, and a\r\ngoose, together with other dainties in great abundance. These, likewise,\r\nfollowed the beakers into the corbels of the slaves, and were succeeded\r\nby numerous dishes, of which the guests were expected to partake on the\r\nspot. Next was brought in a capacious silver tray, also covered by a\r\ncake, whereon were heaped up geese, hares, kids, other cakes curiously\r\nwrought, pigeons, turtle-doves, partridges, with a variety of similar\r\ngame, which, likewise, after they had been tasted, I presume, were\r\nhanded to the servants.[81]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Schol. Aristoph. Eq. 578. Ἔστι τι στλεγγὶς, δέρμα κεχρυσωμένον, ὁ\r\n  περὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν φοροῦσι.—Poll. vii. 179.\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  When the host happened to be less rich or generous, people sometimes,\r\n  in the corruption of later ages, endeavoured to steal what they could\r\n  not obtain as a gift. Thus the sophist Dionysodoros is detected in\r\n  Lucian with a cup stuffed into the breast of his mantle.—Conviv. seu\r\n  Lapith. § 46.\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  This singular kind of liberality continued in fashion down to a very\r\n  late period:—καὶ ἃμα εἰς ἐκικόμιστο ἡμῖν τὸ ἐντελὲς ὀνομαζόμενον\r\n  δεῖπνον, μία ὄρνις ἑκάστω, καὶ κρέας ὑὸς, καὶ λαγῶα, καὶ ἰχθὺς ἐν\r\n  ταγήνου, καὶ σησαμοῦντες, καὶ ὅσα ἐν τραγεῖν, καὶ ἐζῆν ἀποφέρεσθαι\r\n  ταῦτα. Luc. Conviv. § 38.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen the rage of hunger had been appeased, as it must soon have been,\r\nthey washed their hands, after which crowns, wreathed from every kind of\r\nflower, were brought in, and along with them other golden stlengides,\r\nequal in weight to the former, were placed, for form’s sake, on the\r\nheads of the company, before they found their way to the baskets in the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nWhile they were still in a sort of delirium of joy, occasioned by the\r\nmunificence of the bridegroom, there entered to them a troop of female\r\nflute players, singers, and Rhodian performers on the Sambukè,[82] naked\r\nin the opinion of some, though others reported them to have worn a\r\nslight tunic. When these performers had given them a sufficient taste of\r\ntheir art, they retired to make way for other female slaves, bearing\r\neach a pair of perfume vases, containing the measure of a cotyla, the\r\none of gold, the other of silver, and bound together by a golden thong.\r\nOf these every guest received a pair. In fact, the princely bridegroom,\r\nin order, as we suppose, that his friends might share with him the joy\r\nof his nuptials, bestowed upon every one of them a fortune instead of a\r\nsupper; for immediately upon the heels of the gift above described came\r\na number of silver dishes, each of sufficient dimensions to contain a\r\nlarge roast pig, laid upon its back, with its paunch thrown open, and\r\nstuffed with all sorts of delicacies which had been roasted with it,\r\nsuch as thrushes, metræ, and becaficoes, with the yolk of eggs poured\r\naround them, and oysters and cockles. Of these dishes every person\r\npresent received one, with its contents, and, immediately afterwards,\r\nsuch another dish containing a kid hissing hot. Upon this, Caranos\r\nobserving that their corbils were crammed, caused to be presented to\r\nthem wicker panniers, and elegant bread-baskets, plaited with slips of\r\nivory.[83] Delighted by his generosity, the company loudly applauded the\r\nbridegroom, testifying their approbation by clapping their hands. Then\r\nfollowed other gifts, and perfume vases of gold and silver, presented to\r\nthe company in pairs as before. The bustle having subsided, there\r\nsuddenly rushed in a troop of performers worthy to have figured in the\r\nfeast of the Chytræ,[84] at Athens, and along with them ithyphalli,\r\njugglers, and naked female wonder-workers, who danced upon their heads\r\nin circles of swords, and spouted fire from their mouths. These\r\nperformances ended, they set themselves more earnestly and hotly to\r\ndrink, from capacious golden goblets, their wines, now less mixed than\r\nbefore, being the Thasian, the Mendian, and the Lesbian. A glass dish,\r\nthree feet in diameter, was next brought in upon a silver stand, on\r\nwhich were piled all kinds of fried fish. This was accompanied by silver\r\nbread-baskets, filled with Cappadocian rolls, some of which they ate,\r\nand delivered the rest to their slaves. They then washed their hands,\r\nand were crowned with golden crowns, double the weight of the former,\r\nand presented with a third pair of gold and silver vases filled with\r\nperfume. They by this time had become quite delirious with wine, and\r\nbegan a truly Macedonian contest, in which the winner was he who\r\nswallowed most; Proteas, grandson of him who was boon companion to\r\nAlexander the Great, drinking upwards of a gallon at a draught, and\r\nexclaiming—\r\n\r\n                     “Most joy is in his soul\r\n                     Who drains the largest bowl.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  The Sambukè was a stringed instrument of triangular form, invented by\r\n  the poet Ibycos.

Upon this, nine valiant bacchanals started up at once,\r\nand sought each to empty the goblet before the others, while one unhappy\r\nwight among the company, envying them their good fortune, sat down and\r\nburst into tears because he should go cupless away. The master of the\r\nhouse, however, unwilling that any should be dissatisfied, presented him\r\nwith an empty bowl.[85]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  In like manner, Alexander, son of Philip, when he entertained nine\r\n  thousand persons at a marriage feast at Susa, presented each of them\r\n  with a golden goblet, and paid all their debts, amounting to nearly\r\n  ten thousand talents.—Plut. Alexand. § 70.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA chorus of a hundred men now entered to chaunt the epithalamium; and\r\nafter them dancing girls, dressed in the character of nymphs and\r\nnereids.\r\n\r\nThe drinking still proceeding, and the darkness of evening coming on,\r\nthe circle of the hall appeared suddenly to dilate, a succession of\r\nwhite curtains, which had extended all round, and disguised its\r\ndimensions, being drawn up, while from numerous recesses in the wall,\r\nthrown open by concealed machinery, a blaze of torches flashed upon the\r\nguests, seeming to be borne by a troop of gods and goddesses, Hermes,\r\nPan, Artemis, and the Loves, with numerous other divinities, each\r\nholding a flambeau and administering light to the assembled mortals.\r\n\r\nWhile every person was expressing his admiration of this contrivance,\r\nwild boars of true Erymanthean dimensions, transfixed with silver\r\njavelins, were brought in on square trays with golden rims, one of which\r\nwas presented to each of the company. To the _bon vivants_ themselves\r\nnothing appeared so worthy of commendation, as that, when anything\r\nwonderful was exhibited, they should all have been able to get upon\r\ntheir legs, and preserve the perpendicular, notwithstanding they were so\r\ntop-heavy with wine.\r\n\r\n“Our slaves,” says one of the guests, “piled all the gifts we had\r\nreceived in our baskets; and the trumpet, according to the custom of the\r\nMacedonians, at length announced the termination of the repast.” Caranos\r\nnext began that part of the potations in which small cups alone figured,\r\nand commanded the slaves to circulate the wine briskly; what they drank\r\nin this second bout being regarded as an antidote against that which\r\nthey had swallowed before.\r\n\r\nThey were now, as might be supposed, in the right trim to be amused, and\r\nthere entered to them the buffoon Mandrogenes, a descendant, it was\r\nsaid, of Strato the Athenian. This professional gentleman for a long\r\ntime shook their sides with laughter, and terminated his performances by\r\ndancing with his wife, an old woman, upwards of eighty.[86] This fit of\r\nmerriment would appear to have restored the edge of their appetites, and\r\nmade them ready for those supplementary dainties which closed the\r\nachievements of the day. These consisted of a variety of sweetmeats,\r\nrendered more tempting by the little ivory-plaited corbels in which they\r\nnestled, delicate cakes from Crete, and Samos, and Attica, in the boxes\r\nin which they were imported.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  If octogenarian dancers were held in admiration in England, it would,\r\n  according to Lord Bacon, be easy to form an army of them; since “there\r\n  is, he says, scarce a village with us, if it be any whit populous, but\r\n  it affords some man or woman of fourscore years of age; nay, a few\r\n  years since there was, in the county of Hereford, a May-game, or\r\n  morrice-dance, consisting of eight men, whose age computed together,\r\n  made up eight hundred years, inasmuch as what some of them wanted of\r\n  an hundred, others exceeded as much.” History of Life and Death, p.\r\n  20.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHippolochos, to whose enthusiasm for descriptions of good cheer, the\r\nreader is indebted for the above picturesque details, concludes his\r\nimportant narrative by observing, that, when they rose to depart, their\r\nanxiety respecting the wealth they had acquired sobered them completely.\r\nHe then adds, addressing himself to his correspondent Lynceus,\r\n“Meanwhile you, my friend, remaining all alone at Athens, enjoy the\r\nlectures of Theophrastus with your thyme, rocket and delicate twists,\r\nmingling in the revels of the Linnean and Chytrean festivals. For our\r\nown part we are looking out, some for houses, others for estates, others\r\nfor slaves, to be purchased by the riches which dropped into our baskets\r\nat the supper of Caranos.”\r\n\r\nThe marriage feast having been thus concluded, the bride was conducted\r\nto the harem by the light of flambeaux, round one of which,\r\npre-eminently denominated the “Hymeneal Torch,” her mother, who was\r\nprincipal among the torch-bearers, twisted her hair-lace,[87] unbound at\r\nthe moment from her head. On retiring to the nuptial chamber the bride,\r\nin obedience to the laws, ate a quince, together with the bridegroom, to\r\nsignify, we are told, that their first conversation should be full of\r\nsweetness and harmony.[88] The guests continued their revels with music,\r\ndancing, and song, until far in the night.[89]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  Senec.

On appearing in the presence of their congratulators, the wife,\r\nas a mark of affection, presented her husband with a rich woollen\r\ncloak,[91] in part, at least, the production of her own fair hands. On\r\nthe same occasion the father of the bride sent a number of costly gifts\r\nto the house of his son-in-law, consisting of cups, goblets, or vases of\r\nalabaster or gold, beds, couches, candelabra, or boxes for perfumes or\r\ncosmetics, combs, jewel-cases, costly sandals, or other articles of use\r\nor luxury. And, that so striking an instance of his wealth and\r\ngenerosity might not escape public observation, the whole was conveyed\r\nto the bridegroom’s house in great pomp by female slaves, before whom\r\nmarched a boy clothed in white, and bearing a torch in his hand,\r\naccompanied by a youthful basket-bearer habited like a canephora in the\r\nsacred processions.[92] Customs in spirit exactly similar still survive\r\namong the primitive mountaineers of Wales, where the newly-married\r\ncouple, in the middle and lower ranks of life, have their houses\r\ncompletely furnished by the free-will offerings, not only of their\r\nparents but of their friends. It is, however, incumbent on the\r\nrecipients to make proof in their turn of equal generosity when any\r\nmember of the donor’s family ventures on the hazards of housekeeping.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  Theocrit, Eidyll. xviii. 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  Ἀπαυλιστηρία.

We\r\nmust now enter the harem, and observe how they lived there. Most,\r\nperhaps, of the misapprehensions which prevail on this subject arise out\r\nof one very obvious omission,—a neglect to distinguish between the\r\nexaggeration and satire of the comic poets, much of which, in all\r\ncountries, has been levelled at women, and the sober truth of history,\r\nless startling, and therefore, less palatable. To comprehend the\r\nAthenians, however, we must be content to view them as they were, with\r\nmany virtues and many vices, often sinning against their women, but\r\nnever as a general rule treating them harshly. Indeed, according to no\r\ndespicable testimony, their errors when they erred would appear to have\r\nlain in the contrary direction.[93]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  For example, public opinion regarded it as more atrocious to kill a\r\n  woman than a man.—Arist. Prob. xxix. 11.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCertainly the mistress of a family at Athens was not placed above the\r\nnecessity of extending her solicitude to the government of her\r\nhousehold, though too many even there neglected it, degenerating into\r\nthe resemblance of those mawkish, insipid, useless things, without heart\r\nor head, who often in our times fill fashionable drawing-rooms, and have\r\ntheir reputations translated to Doctors’ Commons. Of female education I\r\nhave already spoken, together with the several acts and ceremonies,\r\nwhich conducted an Athenian woman to the highest and most honourable\r\nstation her sex can fill on earth. In this new relation she shares with\r\nher husband that domestic patriarchal sovereignty, pictures of which\r\nabound in the Scriptures. How great soever might be the establishment,\r\nshe was queen of every thing within doors. All the slaves, male and\r\nfemale, came under her control.[94] To every one she distributed his\r\ntask, and issued her commands; and when there were no children who\r\nrequired her care, she might often be seen sitting in the recesses of\r\nthe harem, at the loom, encircled, like an Homeric princess, by her\r\nmaids,[95] laughing, chatting, or, along with them, exercising her sweet\r\nvoice in songs,[96] those natural bursts of melody which came\r\nspontaneously to the lips of a people whose every-day speech resembled\r\nthe music of the nightingale.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  She wakes them in the morning.—Aristoph. Lysist. 18. This comic poet\r\n  gives a concise sketch of an Athenian woman’s morning work, which\r\n  rendered their going out difficult at such an hour:—Χαλεπή τε γυναικῶν\r\n  ἔξοδος· ἠ μὲν γὰρ ἡμῶν περὶ τὸν ἀνδρ’ ἐκύπτασεν· ἠ δ᾽ οἰκέτην ἤγειρεν·\r\n  ἡ δὲ παιδίον κατέκλινεν· ἡ δ᾽ ἐλουσεν· ἠ δ᾽ ἐψώμισεν.—Lysist. 16, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 95:\r\n\r\n  Precisely the same picture is presented in the interior of Jason’s\r\n  palace at Pheræ, where we find the tyrant’s mother at work in the\r\n  midst of her handmaidens.—Polyæn. Stratag. vi. i. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Legg. t. viii. p. 36.—Among the Thracians, and many other\r\n  people, women were employed in agriculture, as they are in England and\r\n  France, as herdswomen and shepherds, and every other laborious\r\n  employment, like men.—Id. ib.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nXenophon, in that interesting work, the Œconomics, introduces an\r\nAthenian gentleman laying open to Socrates the internal regulations of\r\nhis family. In this picture, the wife occupies an important position in\r\nthe foreground. She is, indeed, the principal figure around which the\r\nvarious circumstances of the composition are grouped with infinite\r\ndelicacy and effect. Young and beautiful she comes forth hesitating and\r\nblushing at being detected in some slight economical blunders. The\r\nhusband takes her by the hand; they converse in our presence, and while\r\nthe interior arrangements of a Greek house are unreservedly laid open,\r\nwe discover the exact footing on which husband and wife lived at Athens,\r\nand a state of more complete confidence, of greater mutual affection, of\r\nmore considerate tenderness on the one side, or feminine reliance and\r\nlove on the other, it would be difficult to conceive.\r\n\r\nIschomachos, I admit, is to be regarded as a favourable specimen; he\r\nunites in his character the qualities of an enterprising and enlightened\r\ncountry gentleman, with those of a politician and orator of no mean\r\norder, and his probity as a citizen infuses an air of mingled grandeur\r\nand sweetness into his domestic manners. Describing a conversation\r\nwhich, soon after their marriage, took place between him and his\r\nyouthful wife, he observes:—“When we had together taken a view of our\r\npossessions I remarked to her that, without her constant care and\r\nsuperintendence, nothing of all she had seen would greatly profit us.\r\nAnd taking my illustration from the science of politics, I showed that,\r\nin well-regulated states, it is not deemed sufficient that good laws are\r\nenacted, but that proper persons are chosen to be guardians of those\r\nlaws, who not only reward with praise such as yield them due obedience,\r\nbut visit also their infraction with punishment. Now, my love,” said I,\r\n“you must consider yourself the guardian of our domestic commonwealth,\r\nand dispose of all its resources as the commander of a garrison disposes\r\nof the soldiers under his orders. With you it entirely rests to\r\ndetermine respecting the conduct of every individual in the household,\r\nand, like a queen, to bestow praise and reward on the dutiful and\r\nobedient, while you keep in check the refractory by punishment and\r\nreproof. Nor should this high charge appear burdensome to you; for\r\nthough the duties of your station may seem to involve deeper solicitude\r\nand necessity for greater exertion than we require even from a domestic,\r\nthese greater cares are rewarded by greater enjoyments; since, whatever\r\nability they may display in the improving or protecting of their\r\nmaster’s property, the measure of their advantages still depends upon\r\nhis will, while you, as its joint owner, enjoy the right of applying it\r\nto whatever use you please. It follows, therefore, that as the person\r\nmost interested in its preservation you should cheerfully encounter\r\nsuperior difficulties.”\r\n\r\nHaving listened attentively to the somewhat quaint discourse of the\r\nEconomist, Socrates felt anxious, as well he might, to learn the result;\r\nfor the lady, expected thus wisely “to queen it,” was as yet but\r\nfifteen. His faith, however, in womanhood was great; and Xenophon, who\r\nbut reflects from a less brilliant mirror the Socratic wisdom, delivers,\r\nunder the mask of Ischomachos, the mingled convictions both of the\r\nmaster and the pupil. The moral beauty of the dialogue, and its truth to\r\nnature, would have been lost had the lady at all shrunk from the duties\r\nof her high office. But her ambition was at once awakened. The obscurity\r\nto which, in the time of Pericles, women were, by the manners of the\r\ncountry, condemned, now no longer seemed desirable, and the love of fame\r\nwas urged upon her as a motive to extraordinary exertions.[97] Her reply\r\nis highly characteristic. Running, with the unerring tact of her sex,\r\neven in advance of her husband, she desired him to believe that he would\r\nhave formed an extremely erroneous opinion of her character, had he for\r\na moment supposed that the care of their common property could ever have\r\nproved burdensome to her: on the contrary, the really grievous thing\r\nwould have been to require her to be neglectful of it!\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  That this passion led women to interfere too frequently with politics\r\n  may be inferred from the remark of Theophrastus, that to be versed in\r\n  the science of domestic economy was more honourable to them.—Stob. 85.\r\n  7. Gaisf.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMen always conceive they are complimenting a woman when they attribute\r\nto her a masculine understanding, and they thus, in fact, do place her\r\non the highest intellectual level known to them. Socrates adopted this\r\nstyle of compliment in speaking of the wife of Ischomachos. And I may\r\nhere remark, that we need no other proof of how differently the\r\nAthenians felt on the subject of women from the Orientals with whom they\r\nhave been compared, than the mere circumstance of their conversing\r\nopenly with strangers respecting their wives. In the East, a greater\r\naffront could scarcely be offered a man than to inquire about his female\r\nestablishment. The most an old friend does is to say, “Is your house\r\nwell?”—whereas at Athens, women formed a never-failing theme in all\r\ncompanies; which proves them to have been there contemplated in a\r\ndifferent light. In fact, the sentiments of Ischomachos, every way\r\nworthy the most chivalrous people of antiquity, could only have sprung\r\nup in a society where just and exalted notions of female virtue\r\nprevailed; for, under the word “high-mindedness,” we find him grouping\r\nevery refined and estimable quality which a gentlewoman can possess.\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps, the reader will not be displeased if we introduce\r\ndramatically upon the scene an Athenian married pair discussing in his\r\npresence a question closely connected with domestic happiness. There is\r\nlittle risk of exaggeration. The picture is by Xenophon, a writer whose\r\nsubdued and sober colouring is calculated rather to diminish than\r\notherwise the poetical features of his subject.\r\n\r\nBy Heaven! exclaimed Socrates, according to this account, your wife’s\r\nunderstanding must be of a highly masculine character.\r\n\r\nNay, but suffer me, answered the husband, to place before you a\r\nconvincing proof of her high-mindedness, by showing how, on a single\r\nrepresentation, she yielded to me on a subject extremely important.\r\n\r\nProceed, cried the philosopher, (who had not found Xantippe thus\r\nmanageable,) proceed; for, believe me, friend, I experience much greater\r\ndelight in contemplating the active virtues of a living woman, than the\r\nmost exquisite female form by the pencil of Zeuxis would afford me.\r\n\r\nObserving, said Ischomachos, that my wife sought by cosmetics[98] and\r\nother arts of the toilette to render herself fairer and ruddier than she\r\nhad issued from the hands of Nature, and that she wore high-heeled shoes\r\nin order to add to her stature,—Tell me, wife,[99] I began, would you\r\nnow esteem me to be a worthy participator of your fortunes if,\r\nconcealing the true state of my affairs, I aimed at appearing richer\r\nthan I am, by exhibiting to you heaps of false money, necklaces of\r\ngilded wood for gold, and wardrobes of spurious for genuine purple?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  Xen. Œcon. x. ii. 60. Among the Orientals we find there existed a\r\n  peculiar collyrium for the white of the eye. Bochart, Hieroz, Pt. ii.\r\n  p. 120.\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  Γύναι, a term of greatest endearment among the Greeks, as with the\r\n  French “ma femme.” On this point our language is more sophisticated.\r\n  The practice reprehended by Ischomachos, in the text, was generally\r\n  prevalent in Greece, where certain classes of the community, who could\r\n  afford nothing better, used, when they had painted the rest of their\r\n  skin white, to dye the cheeks with mulberry-juice, and paint the\r\n  eyelids black at the edge. In hot weather, therefore, dusky streamlets\r\n  sometimes flowed from the corners of their eyes; and the roses melted\r\n  from their cheeks, and dropped into their bosoms. They imitated old\r\n  age, too, by covering their hair with white powder. (Athen. xiii. 6.)\r\n  It was likewise, at one time, the fashion to bring forward their curls\r\n  so as to conceal the forehead, as was the practice in France and\r\n  England during a part of the eighteenth century.—Lucian, Dial. Meret.\r\n  i. t. iv. p. 123.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNay, exclaimed my wife, interrupting me, put not the injurious\r\nsupposition: it is what you could not be guilty of. For, were such your\r\ncharacter I could never love you from my soul.\r\n\r\nWell, by entering together into the bonds of marriage are we not\r\nmutually invested with a property in each other’s persons?\r\n\r\nPeople say so.\r\n\r\nThey say truly: and since this is the case shall I not more sincerely\r\nevince my esteem for you by watching sedulously over my own health and\r\nwell-being, and displaying to your gaze the natural hues of a manly\r\ncomplexion, than if, neglecting these, I presented myself with rouged\r\ncheeks, eyes encircled by paint, and my whole exterior false and hollow?\r\n\r\nIndeed, she replied, I prefer the native colour of your cheeks to any\r\nartificial bloom, and could never gaze with so much delight into any\r\neyes as into yours—bright and sparkling with health.\r\n\r\nThen believe no less of me, said I; but be well persuaded that, in my\r\njudgment, there are no tints so beautiful as those with which nature has\r\nadorned your cheeks. The same rule indeed holds universally. For, even\r\nin the inferior creation, every living thing delights most in\r\nindividuals of its own species. And so it is with man whom nothing so\r\ntruly pleases as to behold the image of his own nature mirrored in\r\nanother and a fairer form of humanity. Besides, false beauties, though\r\nthey may deceive the incurious glance of strangers,[100] must inevitably\r\nbe detected by persons living always together. Women necessarily appear\r\nundisguised when first rising in the morning, before they have undergone\r\nthe renovation of the toilette; and perspiration, or tears, or the\r\nwaters of the bath, will even at other times float away their artificial\r\ncomplexions.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Lucian, Amor. § 42. Aristoph. Nub. 49.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnd what, in the name of all the gods, did she say to that? inquired\r\nSocrates.\r\n\r\nWhat? replied the husband. Why, that for the future she would abjure all\r\nmeretricious ornaments, and consent to appear decked with that simple\r\ngrace and beauty which she owed to nature.\r\n\r\nAt Sparta married persons, as in France, occupied separate beds; but\r\namong the Athenians and in other parts of Greece a different custom\r\nprevailed. The same remark may be applied to the Heroic Ages. Odysseus\r\nand Penelope, Alcinoös and Arete, Paris and Helen, occupy the same\r\nchamber and the same couch. The women in the Lysistrata of Aristophanes\r\nappealed to this circumstance in justification of their late appearance\r\nat the female assembly held before day, and Euphiletos in the oration of\r\nLysias on Eratosthenes’ murder, who admits us freely into the recesses\r\nof the harem, confirms this fact, except, that when the mother suckled\r\nher own child she usually slept with it in a separate bed. At Byzantium\r\nalso the same practice prevailed, as we learn from a very amusing\r\nanecdote. Python an orator of that city who, like Falstaff, seems to\r\nhave been somewhere about two yards in the waist, once quelled an\r\ninsurrection by a jocular allusion to this part of domestic economy. “My\r\ndear fellow-citizens,” cried he to the enraged multitude, “you see how\r\nfat I am. Well! my wife is still fatter than I, yet when we agree one\r\nsmall bed will contain us both; but, if we once begin to quarrel, the\r\nwhole house is too little to hold us.”[101]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xii. 74.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWe have seen above how absolute was the authority of women over their\r\nhousehold, and this authority likewise extended to their children. The\r\nfather no doubt could exercise, when he chose, considerable influence;\r\nbut as most of his time was spent abroad, in business or politics, the\r\nchief charge of their early education, the first training of their\r\nintellect, the first rooting of their morals and shaping of their\r\nprinciples devolved upon the mother.[102] There have been writers,\r\nindeed, to whom this has seemed a circumstance to be lamented. But their\r\njudgment probably was warped by theory. In the original discipline of\r\nthe mind, great attainments and experience of the world are less needed\r\nthan tact to discern, and patience to apply, those minute incentives to\r\naction which women discover with a truer sagacity than we do. In this\r\ntask, ever pleasing to a true mother, the aid of nurses, however, was\r\nusually obtained; nor are we, as Cramer observes, on this account to\r\nblame the Athenian ladies, so long as they did not, as in after times\r\nwas too much the fashion, consider their whole duty performed when they\r\nhad delivered their children to the nurse.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph. Œcon. vii. 12. 24. Cf. A. Cramer. de Educ. Puer. ap. Athen. 9.\r\n  This writer acutely remarks, (p. 13,) that the words καὶ αὐτος ὁ πατὴρ\r\n  in Plat. Protag. p. 325. d. show that it was seldom the father meddled\r\n  with the matter. The mother, therefore, from early habit, was held in\r\n  greater love and reverence than the father. Casaub. ad Theoph. Char.\r\n  p. 187.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt will be evident from what has been said, that an Athenian lady who\r\nconscientiously discharged her duties was very little exposed to ennui.\r\nShe arose in the morning with the lark, roused her slaves, distributed\r\nto all their tasks,[103] superintended the operations of the nursery,\r\nand, on days frequently recurring, went abroad in the performance of\r\nrites specially allotted to her sex. But, one effect of democracy is to\r\nconfer undue influence upon women.[104] And this influence, where by\r\neducation or otherwise they happen to be luxurious or vain, must\r\ninfallibly prove pernicious to the state. At Athens, the number of this\r\nclass of women, extremely limited in the beginning, augmented rapidly\r\nduring the decline of the republic, and the comic poets substituting a\r\npart for the whole, invest their countrywomen generally with the\r\nqualities belonging exclusively to these.—But, the success of such\r\nwriters depending generally on ingenious extravagance and exaggeration,\r\nwe must be on our guard against their insinuations. Their faith in the\r\nexistence of virtue, male or female, has, in all ages, if we are to\r\njudge by their works, been very lanksided. In their view, if there has\r\nbeen one good woman since the world began, it is as much as there has.\r\nAccordingly when these lively caricaturists describe the female _demos_\r\nas addicted extravagantly to wine[105] and pawning their wardrobe to\r\npurchase it—as compelling the men by their intemperance to keep their\r\ncellars under lock and key, and still defeating them by manufacturing\r\nfalse ones—as forming illicit connexions, and having recourse to the\r\nboldest stratagems in furtherance of their intrigues, we must\r\nnecessarily suppose them to have amused themselves at the expense of\r\ntruth; though that, among the Athenians, there were examples enough of\r\nwomen of whom all this might be said, it would be absurd to deny.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph. Lysist. 18. Plato, who admired the practice, requires his\r\n  airy female citizens to go and do likewise. Καὶ δὴ καὶ δέσποιναν ἐν\r\n  οἰκίᾳ ὑπὸ θεραπαινίδων ἐγείρεσθαί τινων καὶ μὴ πρώτην αὐτὴν ἐγείρειν\r\n  τὰς ἄλλας, αἰσχρὸν λέγειν χρὴ πρὸς αὑτοὺς δοῦλον τε καὶ δούλην καὶ\r\n  παῖδα, καὶ εἴ πως ἦν οἷον τε, ὅλην καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν οἰκίαν.

Lysist. 113, seq. 205.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWe know that where the minds of married dames are fixed chiefly upon\r\ndress and show their anxiety has often very little reference to their\r\nhusbands. And if it be their object to excite admiration out of doors,\r\nit is simply as a means to an end, which end, in too many cases, is\r\nintrigue. Proofs exist that among the Athenian ladies there were numbers\r\nwhose idle lives and luxurious habits produced their natural\r\nresults—loose principles and dissolute manners. The beauty of Alcibiades\r\ndrew them after him in crowds,[106] though we do not read that, like\r\nanother very handsome personage in a modern republic, the son of\r\nCleinias found it necessary to carry about a club to defend himself from\r\ntheir importunities. They went abroad elaborately habited and adorned\r\nmerely to attract the gaze of men,[107] and having thus sown the first\r\nseeds of intrigue, they took care to cultivate and bring them to\r\nmaturity. The felicitous invention of Falstaff’s friends, which got him\r\nsafe out of Ford’s house in a buck-basket, was not so new as Shakspeare,\r\nperhaps, imagined. His predecessors on the Athenian stage had already\r\ndiscovered stratagems equally happy among their countrywomen, whose\r\nlovers we find made their way into the harem wrapped up in straw, like\r\ncarp—or crept through holes made purposely by fair hands in the eaves—or\r\nscaled the envious walls by the help of those vulgar contrivances called\r\nladders.[108]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph.

Married ladies occasionally rode out in carriages\r\n  with their husbands. Demosth. cont. Mid. § 44. Even at Sparta we find\r\n  young ladies possessed of their carriages called Canathra, resembling\r\n  in form griffins, or goat-stags, in which they rode abroad during\r\n  religious processions.

The same custom prevailed in\r\n  Thessaly and elsewhere. Athen. xii. 37. Luxurious ladies at Athens\r\n  used to perfume even the soles of their feet. Their lapdogs lived in\r\n  great state, and slept on carpets of Miletos. Athen. xii. 78.\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  Xenarch. ap. Athen. xiii. 24.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe laws of Athens, however, were more modest than its women. For, from\r\nthe very interference of the laws, it is evident, that the example of\r\nthe Spartan ladies, who enjoyed the privilege of exposing themselves\r\nindecently, found numerous imitators among the female democracy. To\r\nrepress this unbecoming taste, it was enacted, that any woman detected\r\nin the streets in indecorous deshabille[109] should be fined a thousand\r\ndrachmæ, and, to add disgrace to pecuniary considerations, the name of\r\nthe offender, with the amount of the fine, was inscribed on a tablet and\r\nsuspended on a certain platane tree in the Cerameicos. However, what\r\nconstituted _indecorous deshabille_ in the opinion of Philippides, who\r\nprocured the enactment of the law, it might be difficult to determine.\r\nPossibly it may have consisted in the too great exposure of the bosom,\r\nfor the covering of which ladies in remoter ages appear to have depended\r\nvery much on their veils. Thus in the interview of Helen with Aphrodite\r\nshe saw, says the poet, her beautiful neck, desire-inflaming bosom, and\r\neyes bright with liquid splendour. Her garments concealed the rest.[110]\r\nNow, as it was customary for ladies to appear veiled in public, the\r\nobject of the law of Philippides may simply have been to enforce the\r\nobservance of this ancient practice. The magistrates who presided over\r\nthis very delicate part of Athenian police were denominated “Regulators\r\nof the women,”[111] an office which Sultan Mahmood in our day took upon\r\nhimself. They were chosen by the twenty from among the wealthiest and\r\nmost virtuous of the citizens, and in their office resembled the Roman\r\nCensors and similar magistrates in several other states.[112]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  Ἀκοσμοῦσαι.

But will\r\n  ἀκοσμοῦσαι which Meursius, Lect. Att. ii. 5, 62, renders by\r\n  “inornatius,” bear such a signification? Κόσμος γυναικῶν does not, as\r\n  Kühn observes, signify _ornamentum mulierum_, nor ἀκοσμοῦσαι\r\n  _inornatius prodeuntes feminæ_; but κόσμος is εὐταξία and ἀκοσμοῦσαι\r\n  means ἀτακτοῦσαι, that is, women who acted in any way whatever\r\n  contrary to decorum and good manners, which persons appearing\r\n  indecently dressed in public unquestionably do.—Ad.

Pol. iv. 15. 120.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe evil influence of women of this description,[113] who, as Milton\r\nexpresses it, would fain at any rate ride in their coach and six, was\r\nperceived and lamented by the philosophers. To their vain and frivolous\r\nnotions might be traced, in part at least, the love of power, of\r\ntrifling distinctions, of unmanly pleasures, which infected the\r\nAthenians towards the decline of their republic. By them the springs of\r\neducation were poisoned, and the seeds sown of those inordinate\r\nartificial desires which convulse and overthrow states. In vain did\r\nphilosophers inculcate temperance and moderation, while the youth were\r\nimbued with different opinions by their mothers. The lessons of the\r\nAcademy were overgrown and checked in the harem. Such dames no doubt\r\nwould grieve to find their husbands content with little[114] (as was the\r\ncase with Xantippe) and not numbered with the rulers, since their\r\nconsequence among their own sex was thus lessened. They would have had\r\nthem keen worshipers of Mammon, eagerly squabbling and wrangling in the\r\nlaw-courts or the ecclesiæ, not cultivators of domestic habits or\r\nphilosophical tranquillity and content: and in conversing with their\r\nsons would be careful to recommend maxims the reverse of the father’s,\r\nwith all the cant familiar to women of their character.[115]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  On the luxurious manners of the Syracusan women see Athen. xii. 20. In\r\n  such disorders may be discovered the first germs of the decay of\r\n  states; on which account prudent statesmen even in oligarchies have\r\n  sought to restrain the licentious manners of women. Thus Fra Paolo:\r\n  “Let the women be kept chaste, and in order to that, let them live\r\n  retired from the world; it being certain that all open lewedness has\r\n  had its first rise from a salutation, from a smile.”—i. § 20. To this\r\n  let us add the opinion of the female Pythagorician Phintys: ἴδια δὲ\r\n  γυναικὸς, τὸ οἰκουρὲν, καὶ ἔνδον μένεν καὶ ἐκδέχεσθαι καὶ θεραπεύεν\r\n  τὸν ἄνδρα. Stob. Florileg., 74. 61. Both the philosophical lady,\r\n  however, and the Venetian monk have their views corroborated by the\r\n  authority of Pericles: τῆς τε γὰρ ὑπαρχούσης φύσεως μὴ χείροσι\r\n  γενέσθαι, ὑμῖν μεγάλη ἡ δόξα, καὶ οἷς ἂν ἐπ’ ἄρσεσι κλέος ᾖ. Thucyd.\r\n  ii. 45. Besides leading a retired life, ladies were likewise expected\r\n  to cultivate the virtue of silence. Soph. Ajax, 293. Hom.

Stallb.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOur review of female society at Athens would be incomplete were we to\r\noverlook the Hetairæ who exerted so powerful an influence over the\r\nmorals and destinies of the state. They occupied much the same position\r\nwhich the same class of females still do in modern communities,\r\ncultivated in mind, polished and elegant in manners, but scarcely\r\ndeserving as a body to be viewed in the light in which a very\r\ndistinguished historian has placed them.[116] Their position, however,\r\nwas anomalous, resembling rather that of kings’ mistresses in modern\r\ntimes, whose vices are tolerated on account of their rank, than that of\r\nplebeian sinners whose deficiencies in birth and fortune exclude them\r\nfrom good society. There is much difficulty in rightly apprehending the\r\nnotions of the ancients on the subject of these women. At first sight we\r\nare shocked to find that, during one festival, they were permitted to\r\nenter the temples in company with modest ladies. But in what Christian\r\ncountry are they excluded from church?[117] Again, behold in our\r\ntheatres the matron and the courtezan in the same box, while at Athens\r\neven foreign women were not suffered to approach the space set apart for\r\nthe female citizens. Nevertheless, though on this point so rigid, they\r\nwere in their own houses permitted occasionally to visit them[118] and\r\nreceive instructions from their lips, as in Turkish harems ladies do\r\nfrom the Almè.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 116:\r\n\r\n  Mitford, Hist, of Greece, iii. 4. sqq. It appears not to have been\r\n  common for these women to rear the children they bore, more\r\n  particularly when they were girls. They flew to the practice of\r\n  infanticide that they might remain at liberty. Lucian, Hetair. Diall.\r\n  ii. 5. iv. 124.\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  Besides, from a passage in Lucian it appears that the ladies and the\r\n  hetairæ frequented together the public baths.—Diall. Hetair. xii. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Antiphon. Nec. Venef. § 5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is not permitted here to lift the curtain from the manners of these\r\nladies. But their position, pregnant with evil to the state through its\r\ncontaminating influences on the minds of youth, must be comprehensively\r\nexplained before a correct idea can be formed of the internal structure\r\nof the Athenian commonwealth, of the germs of dissolution which it\r\nconcealed within its own bosom, or the premature blight which an\r\nunspiritual system of morals was mainly instrumental in producing. No\r\ndoubt the question whether the existence of such a class of persons\r\nshould be tolerated at all, is environed by difficulties almost\r\ninsurmountable. They have always existed and therefore, perhaps, it is\r\nallowable to infer that they always will exist; but this does not seem\r\nto justify Solon for sanctioning, by legislative enactments, a\r\nmodification of moral turpitude debasing to the individual, and\r\nconsequently detrimental to the state. To do evil that good may come, is\r\nas much a solecism in politics as in ethics. On this point I miss the\r\nhabitual wisdom of the Athenian legislator. Lycurgus himself could have\r\nenacted nothing more at variance with just principles, or more\r\nsubversive of heroic sentiments.\r\n\r\nThe Hetairæ,[119] recognised by law and scarcely proscribed by public\r\nopinion, may be said to have constituted a sort of monarchical leaven in\r\nthe very heart of the republic; they shared with the sophists, whom I\r\nhave already depicted, the affections of the lax ambitious youths,\r\npanting at once for pleasure and distinction, fostered expensive tastes\r\nand luxurious habits, increased consequently their aptitude to indulge\r\nin peculation, shared with the unprincipled the spoils of the state, and\r\nvigorously paved the way for the battle of Chæronea. But if their\r\nexistence was hurtful to the community, so was it often full of\r\nbitterness to themselves. In youth, no doubt, when beauty breathed its\r\nspell around them, they were puffed up and intoxicated with the incense\r\nof flattery[120]—their conversation at once sprightly and learned seemed\r\nfull of charms—their houses spacious as palaces and splendidly adorned\r\nwere the resort of the gay, the witty, the powerful, nay, even of the\r\nwise—for Socrates did not disdain to converse with Theodota or to imbibe\r\nthe maxims of eloquence from Aspasia. But when old age came on, what\r\nwere they? It then appeared, that the lively repartees and grotesque\r\nextravagancies which had pleased when proceeding from beautiful lips,\r\nseemed vapid and poor from an old woman. The wrinkles which deformed\r\ntheir features were equally fatal to their wisdom that flitted from\r\ntheir dwellings, and became domiciliated with the last beautiful\r\nimportation from Ionia. Thus deserted, the most celebrated Hetairæ\r\nbecame a butt for the satire even of the most clownish. The wit wont to\r\nset the table in a roar scarcely served to defend them against the jests\r\nof the agora.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  Vice is generally superstitious; and these ladies accordingly when\r\n  they lost a lover, instead of attributing it to the superior beauty or\r\n  accomplishments of their rivals, or the common love of novelty of\r\n  mankind, always supposed that enchantments had been employed.—Luc.\r\n  Diall.

They were generally well educated, and there were none\r\n  probably who could not read.—Drosè, in Lucian, complaining of the\r\n  philosopher who kept away her lover, observes that his slave came in\r\n  the evening bearing a note from his young master.—Diall.

In France likewise formerly it was customary\r\n  to avoid the scandal of a public trial, for noblemen and gentlemen to\r\n  be examined privately by the king who, when he could satisfy his\r\n  conscience that they were guilty, ordered them to be “without any\r\n  fashion of judgment put in a sack and in the night season, by the\r\n  Marshall’s servants, hurled into a river and so drowned.” Fortescue,\r\n  Laud, Legg.

Besides, generally barbarians by birth, they\r\nbrought along with them from their original homes the creed best suited\r\nto their calling—“Let us eat and drink for to-morrow we die.” They were\r\noften the lumber of Asia and hence known under the appellation of\r\n“strange women,” though it is very certain, that many female citizens\r\nwere from time to time enrolled among their ranks, some through the\r\npressure of adversity, others from a preference for that kind of life.\r\nTheir education it must be conceded, however, was far more masculine\r\nthan that of other women. They cultivated all the sciences but that of\r\nmorals, and concealed their lack of modesty by the dazzling splendour of\r\ntheir wit. Hence among a people with whom intellect was almost\r\neverything their company was much sought after and highly valued, not\r\nhabitually perhaps by statesmen, but by wits, poets, sophists, and young\r\nmen of fashion.\r\n\r\nMany of the _bons mots_ uttered by those ladies have been preserved. One\r\nday at table Stilpo the philosopher accused Glycera of corrupting the\r\nmanners of youth.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said she, “we are both to blame; for you, in your turn,\r\ncorrupt their minds by innumerable forms of sophistry and error. And if\r\nmen be rendered unhappy, what signifies it whether a philosopher or a\r\ncourtezan be the cause?”\r\n\r\nIt is to her that a joke, somewhat hackneyed but seldom attributed to\r\nits real author, was originally due. A gentleman presenting her with a\r\nvery small jar of wine sought to enhance its value by pretending it was\r\nsixteen years old. “Then,” replied she, “it is extremely little for its\r\nage.” Gnathena too, another member of the sisterhood, sprinkled her\r\nconversation with sparkling wit, but too redolent of the profession to\r\nbe retailed. Some of her sayings, however, will bear transplantation,\r\nthough they must suffer by it. To stop the mouth of a babbler who\r\nobserved that he had just arrived from the Hellespont—“And yet,” she\r\nremarked, “it is clear to me that you know nothing of one of its\r\nprincipal cities!” “Which city is that?”—“Sigeion,”[122] (in which there\r\nappears to be a reference to the word Silence) answered Gnathena.\r\nSeveral noisy gallants, who being in her debt sought to terrify her by\r\nmenaces, once saying they would pull her house down, and had pickaxes\r\nand mattocks ready, “I disbelieve it,” she replied, “for if you had, you\r\nwould have pledged them to pay what you owe me.” A comic poet remarking\r\nto one of these ladies that the water of her cistern was delightfully\r\ncold—“It has always been so,” she replied, “since we have got into the\r\nhabit of throwing your plays into it.” The repartee of Melitta to a\r\nconceited person who was said to have fled ignominiously from the field\r\nof battle is exceedingly keen. Happening to be eating of a hare which\r\nshe seemed much to enjoy, our soldier, desirous of directing attention\r\nto her, inquired if she knew what was the fleetest animal in the world.\r\n“The runaway,” replied Melitta.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 122:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 47.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe same taste which induces many persons of rank in our own day to\r\nmarry opera dancers and actresses, in antiquity favoured the ambition of\r\nthe Hetairæ, many of whom rose from their state of humiliation to be the\r\nwives of satraps and princes. This was the case with Glycera, whom after\r\nthe death of Pythionica, Harpalos sent for from Athens, and domiciliated\r\nwithin his royal palace at Tarsos. He required her to be saluted and\r\nconsidered as his queen, and refused to be crowned unless in conjunction\r\nwith her. Nay, he had even the hardihood to erect in the city of Rossos,\r\na brazen statue to her, beside his own.[123] Herpyllis, one of the same\r\nsisterhood, won the heart of Aristotle, and was the mother of\r\nNicomachos. She survived the philosopher, and was carefully provided for\r\nby his will.[124] Even Plato, whose genius and virtue are still the\r\nadmiration of mankind, succumbed to the charms of Archæanassa, an\r\nHetaira of Colophon, whose beauty, which long survived her youth, he\r\ncelebrated in an epigram still extant.[125]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 50.\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 56.—Diog.

Laert. iii. 31.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOf all these ladies, however, not even excepting Phryne, or the Sicilian\r\nLaïs,[126] Aspasia[127] has obtained the most widely extended fame. This\r\nillustrious woman, endowed by nature with a mind still more beautiful\r\nthan her beautiful form, exercised over the fortunes of Athens an\r\ninfluence beyond the reach of the greatest queen. Her genius, unobserved\r\nfor some time, by degrees drew around her all those whom the love of\r\nletters or ambition induced to cultivate their minds. Her house became a\r\nsort of club-room, where eloquence, politics, philosophy, mixed with\r\nbadinage, were daily discussed, and whither even ladies of the highest\r\nrank resorted to acquire from Aspasia those accomplishments which were\r\nalready beginning to be in fashion. From her Socrates professed to have\r\nin part acquired his knowledge of rhetoric, and it is extremely probable\r\nthat he could trace to the habit of conversing with one so gifted by\r\nnature, so polished by rare society, something of that exquisite\r\nfacility and lightness of manner which characterize his familiar\r\ndialectics. No doubt, we may attribute something of the reputation she\r\nacquired to the desire to disparage Pericles. It was thought that by\r\nappropriating many of his harangues to her they could bring him down\r\nnearer their own level. She was, in influence and celebrity, the Madame\r\nRoland of Athens, though living in times somewhat less troubled.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 126:\r\n\r\n  She was a native of Hyccara, but taken prisoner in childhood, and\r\n  carried to Corinth, whence that city has generally the honor of being\r\n  regarded as her birthplace.—Athen. xiii. 54.—Cf. Thucyd. vi. 62. Sch.\r\n  Aristoph. Lysist. 179.\r\n\r\nFootnote 127:\r\n\r\n  Of the younger Aspasia, who had the reputation of being the loveliest\r\n  woman of her time, we have the following sketch in Ælian:—“Her hair\r\n  was auburn, and fell in slightly waving ringlets. She had large full\r\n  eyes, a nose inclined to aquiline, (ἐπίγρυπος) and small delicate\r\n  ears. Nothing could be softer than her skin, and her complexion was\r\n  fresh as the rose; on which account the Phoceans called her Milto, or\r\n  ‘the Blooming’. Her ruddy lips, opening, disclosed teeth whiter than\r\n  snow. She, moreover, possessed the charm on which Homer so often\r\n  dwells in his descriptions of beautiful women, of small, well-formed\r\n  ankles. Her voice was so full of music and sweetness, that those to\r\n  whom she spoke imagined they heard the songs of the Seirens. To crown\r\n  all she was like Horace’s Pyrrha, simplex munditiis, abhorring\r\n  superfluous pomp of ornament.”—Hist. Var. xii. 1. Some persons,\r\n  however, would not have admired the nose of Milto:—thus, the youth in\r\n  Terence (Heauton, v. 5. 17. seq.) “What? must I marry”\r\n\r\n                     “Rufamne illam virginem\r\n                     Cæsiam, sparso ore, adunco naso?\r\n                     Non possum, pater.”\r\n\r\n  Aristotle (Rhet. i. 2) does not undervalue the slightly aquiline nose;\r\n  and Plato appears rather to have admired it in men.—Repub. v. § 19. t.\r\n  i. p. 392.—Stallb. where the philosopher calls it the Royal Nose.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe name of Phryne, though not so celebrated, is still familiar to every\r\none, partly, perhaps, through the accusation brought against her in the\r\ncourt of Heliæa,[128] by Euthios. She was a native of Thespiæ, but\r\nestablished at Athens, and beloved by the orator Hyperides, who\r\nundertook her defence. His pleading, it may therefore be presumed, was\r\neloquent. Perceiving, however, he could make but little impression on\r\nthe judges, he had her called into court, and, as if by accident, bared\r\nher bosom,[129] the fairness and beauty of which heaving with anguish\r\nand terror—for it was a matter of life and death—so wrought upon the\r\naugust judges that her acquittal immediately followed. The Heliasts,\r\nrenowned for their upright decisions, were suspected on this occasion of\r\nundue commiseration, though the charge was probably grounded on some\r\nfrivolous pretence of impiety; and, to prevent the recurrence of similar\r\npartiality in future, a decree was passed, rendering it illegal thus to\r\nextort the pity of the court, or, on any account, to introduce the\r\naccused, whether man or woman, into the presence of the judges. It was\r\non her figure that Apelles chiefly relied in painting his Aphrodite\r\nrising from the sea, as Phryne herself rose before all Greece on the\r\nbeach at Eleusis; and Praxiteles also wrought from the same model his\r\nCnidean Aphrodite.[130] This sculptor, who was the rival of Hyperides,\r\nand, indeed, of all Athens, in the affections of Phryne, permitted her\r\none day to make choice for herself from two statues of his own\r\nworkmanship—the Eros and the Satyr. Discovering, by a stratagem, that he\r\nhimself preferred the former, she was guided by his judgment, and\r\ndedicated the winged god in a temple of her native city. In admiration\r\nof her beauty, a number of gentlemen erected, by subscription, in her\r\nhonour, a golden statue at Delphi. It was the work of Praxiteles, and\r\nstood on a pillar of white marble of Pentelicos, between the statues of\r\nArchidamos, king of Sparta, and Philip, son of Amyntas. The inscription\r\nran simply thus:—\r\n\r\n               “Phryne, of Thespiæ, daughter of Epicles.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 128:\r\n\r\n  Poseidip. ap. Athen. xiii. 60.\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  Honest old Burton, whom few anecdotes of this description escaped,\r\n  imagines this artifice to have been the only defence he made.—Anatomy\r\n  of Melancholy, ii. 222.\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 59. seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOn seeing this statue, Crates, the cynic, exclaimed, “Behold a trophy of\r\nHellenic wantonness!”\r\n\r\nIt is not, of course, among women of this class, that we should expect\r\nto discover proofs of female truth or enduring attachment. But the human\r\nheart sometimes triumphs over adverse circumstances.[131] History has\r\npreserved the memory of more than one act of heroism performed by an\r\nHetaira, to show that woman doth not always put off her other virtues,\r\nthough habitually trampling on the one which constitutes for her the\r\nboundary between honour and infamy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 59.—In the apprehension of Lucian, too, they were\r\n  anything but mercenary; and stripped themselves cheerfully of all\r\n  their personal ornaments to bestow them, like so many sisters, on the\r\n  person they loved.—Diall. Hetair. vii. 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPtolemy, son of Philadelphos, while commanding the garrison of Ephesos,\r\nhad along with him the courtezan, Irene, who, when his Thracian\r\nmercenaries rose in revolt, fled along with him to the temple of\r\nArtemis, where they fell together, sprinkling the altar with their\r\nblood.[132] Alcibiades, too, of all his friends, found none adhere to\r\nhim in his adversity but an Hetaira, who cheerfully exposed her life for\r\nhis sake; and, when the assassins of Pharnabazos had achieved their\r\ntask, performed, like another Antigone, the last duties over the ashes\r\nof the man she loved.[133] Other anecdotes might be added equally\r\nhonourable to their feelings and fidelity, but these will sufficiently\r\nillustrate their character and the estimation in which they were\r\ngenerally held.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 64.\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Alcib. § 39.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI.\r\n                    TOILETTE, DRESS, AND ORNAMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now described the condition and influence of women, it will be\r\nnecessary to institute some inquiry into one of the principal means by\r\nwhich they achieved and maintained their empire. At first sight,\r\nperhaps, the disquisition may appear scarcely to deserve all the pains I\r\nhave bestowed upon it; but, as the dress of the ancients is connected on\r\nthe one hand with the progress of the useful arts, as spinning, weaving,\r\ndyeing, &c., and on the other with the forms and developement of\r\nsculpture, it can scarcely, when well considered, be reckoned among\r\nmatters of trifling moment. Besides, the costume and ornaments of a\r\npeople often afford important aid towards comprehending the national\r\ncharacter, constituting, in fact, a sort of practical commentary on the\r\nmental habits, and tone and principles of morals, prevailing at any\r\ngiven period among them.\r\n\r\nThe raiment of the Grecian women, of which the public generally obtain\r\nsome idea from the remaining monuments of ancient art, may be said to\r\nhave been regulated by the same laws of taste which presided over the\r\ndevelopement of the national genius in sculpture and painting. Every\r\narticle of their habiliment appeared to harmonise exactly with the rest.\r\nNothing of that grotesque extravagance which in some of the fleeting\r\nvagaries of fashion transforms our modern ladies, with their inflated\r\nballoon sleeves and painfully deformed waists, into so many whalebone\r\nand muslin hobgoblins, was ever allowed to disfigure the rich contour of\r\na Greek woman. As she proceeded lovely from the hands of nature, her\r\npride was to preserve that loveliness. Her garments, accordingly, were\r\nnot fashioned with a view to disguise or conceal her form, but by\r\ngraceful folds, flowing curves, ornaments rich and tastefully disposed,\r\nto afford as many indications of its matchless symmetry and perfection\r\nas might be compatible with her sex’s delicacy and the severity of\r\npublic morals. Consequently the art of dress, like every other\r\nconversant with taste and beauty, reached in Greece its highest\r\nperfection. A woman draped according to the prevalent fashion in the\r\nbest ages of the Athenian commonwealth, was an object not to be equalled\r\nfor elegance or grace. From the snow white veil which probably shaded\r\nher countenance and ringlets of auburn or hyacinth, to the sandals of\r\nwhite satin and gold that ornamented her small ankle, the eye could\r\ndetect nothing gaudy, affected, or out of keeping. There was\r\nmagnificence without ostentation, brilliance of colours, but a\r\nbrilliance that harmonised with whatever was brought in contact with it;\r\nthe splendour of numerous jewels and trinkets of gold, but no appearance\r\nof display, or of a wish to dazzle. Everything appeared to stand where\r\nit did, because it was its proper place.\r\n\r\nBut in Sparta where there existed little tendency towards art or\r\nrefinement,[134] a costume the antipodes of all this prevailed. That of\r\nthe virgins differed in some respects from that of the matrons, and the\r\ndifference arose out of a peculiar feature of manners, in which, if in\r\nnothing else, they resembled the English. In several Ionic countries, as\r\nat present on the continent, girls were previously to marriage guarded\r\nwith much strictness. At Sparta, on the contrary, and among the Dorians\r\ngenerally,[135] they were permitted, as in England, to walk abroad in\r\ncompany with young men, and, of course, to form attachments at their own\r\ndiscretion. In this, too, as in their dress, they only preserved the\r\ncustoms of antiquity; for in Homer we find the Trojan ladies making\r\nanxious inquiries of Hector respecting their relations and friends in\r\nthe field, and going forth from their houses attended only by their\r\nmaids. The married women led more retired lives, and when they went\r\nabroad fashion required that they should be veiled, as we learn from the\r\nfollowing apophthegm of Charillos, who being asked why the maidens went\r\nabroad uncovered while the matrons concealed their faces, replied:\r\n“Because it is incumbent on the former to find themselves husbands, on\r\nthe latter only to keep those they have.”[136]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Montaigne, Essais, t. iv. p. 214, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  See above, chapter ii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Apophtheg. Lacon. Charill. 2. t. i. p. 161.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe principal, or, rather, the sole garment of the Dorian maidens was\r\nthe chiton, or himation,[137] made of woollen stuff, and without\r\nsleeves, but fastened on either shoulder by a large clasp, and gathered\r\non the breast by a kind of brooch. This sleeveless robe, which seldom\r\nreached more than half way to the knee, was moreover left open up to a\r\ncertain point on both sides,[138] so that the skirts or wings, flying\r\nopen as they walked, entirely exposed their limbs, closely resembling\r\nthe shift of the Bedouin women,[139] slit up to the arm-pit, but\r\ngathered tight by a girdle about the waist. When the girdle was removed\r\nit reached to the calves of the legs,[140] and would then, but for the\r\nside-slits, have been quite as becoming as the blue chemise of the\r\nmodern Egyptian women, which is open in front from the neck to the\r\nwaist.[141] When dressed in this single robe, their whole form breathing\r\nhealth, and modesty in their countenance, there was no doubt a simple\r\nelegance in their appearance, little less attractive, perhaps, than the\r\nexquisite and elaborate _mise_ of an Ionian or an Attic girl. In this\r\ncostume Melissa, daughter of Procles, of Epidaurus, was habited when, as\r\nshe poured out wine to her father’s labourers, Periander, the\r\nCorinthian,[142] beheld and loved her. The married women, however, did\r\nnot make their appearance in public _en chemise_, but when going abroad\r\ndonned a second garment which seems to have resembled pretty closely\r\ntheir husbands’ himatia.[143]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  Herod. v. 87.

Montaigne observes, that\r\n  the ancient Gauls made little use of clothing; and that the same thing\r\n  might be said of the Irish of his time, t. iv. p. 214.—The French\r\n  ladies, also, of his own day, affected a costume in no respect less\r\n  indelicate than that of the Spartan girls: “nos dames, ainsi molles et\r\n  delicates qu’elles sont, elles s’en vont tantôt entre ouvertes jusques\r\n  au nombril.”—Essais, II. xii. t. iv. p. 213.\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 56.\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Il. ε. 425.—In the life of Pyrrhus, the difference between the\r\n  dress of married women and that of the virgins is distinctly pointed\r\n  out:—ἀρχομένοις δὲ ταῦτα πράττειν, ἧκον αὐτοις τῶν παρθενῶν καὶ\r\n  γυναικῶν, αἱ μὲν ἐν ἱματίοις, καταζωσάμεναι τοὺς χιτωνίσκους, αἱ δὲ\r\n  μονοχίτωνες, συναργασόμεναι τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις. Plut. Pyrrh. § 27.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOf the simple wardrobe of a Doric lady, which in ancient times was that\r\nof all women of Hellenic race, exceedingly little can be said. It is\r\naltogether different with respect to that of the gentlewomen of Attica,\r\nwhere, though inferior in personal beauty to none, the women exhibited\r\nso much fertility in the matter of dress, that they appeared to depend\r\non that alone for the establishment of their empire. For this reason it\r\nwould be vain to pretend to describe all their vestments and ornaments,\r\nor the arts of the toilette by which they were adapted to their\r\npurposes. To do so properly would, in fact, require a volume. But all\r\nthat can be crowded into one short chapter shall be given, since I am\r\nnot deterred by any such scruples as formerly arrested the pen of a very\r\nlearned writer, who apprehended that, if he proceeded, he might be\r\nsupposed to have been rummaging the boudoir notes of an Athenian\r\nlady![144]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  Taylor ad Demosth.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe primary garment,[145] answering to the _chemise_ of the moderns, was\r\na white tunic reaching to the ground,[146] in some instances sleeveless,\r\nand fastened on the shoulders with buttons, in others furnished with\r\nloose hanging sleeves descending to the wrist, and brought together at\r\nintervals upon the arm by silver or golden agraffes.[147] It was\r\ngathered into close folds under the bosom by a girdle,[148] or riband,\r\nsometimes fastened in front by a knot, sometimes by a clasp.[149] This\r\ninner robe, made in the earlier ages of fine linen,[150] manufactured in\r\nAttica, or imported from Tyre, Egypt, or Sidon, came, in after times, to\r\nbe of muslin from Tarentum, or woven at home from Egyptian cotton. The\r\nuse of linen, however, for this purpose was not wholly superseded. A\r\nvery beautiful kind, from the island of Amorgos,[151] one of the\r\nCyclades, was often substituted down to a very late period in place of\r\nthe byssos, or fine muslin of Egypt; and this insular fabric,[152]\r\nwhether snow-white or purple, would have rivalled the finest cambric,\r\nbeing of the most delicate texture and semi-transparent,[153] like the\r\nTarentine and Coan vests of the Roman ladies, the sandyx-coloured Lydian\r\nrobe, or the silken chemises of the Turkish sultanas, described by Lady\r\nMontague.[154] It is in a tunic of this linen that Lysistrata, in\r\nAristophanes, advises the Athenian ladies to appear before their\r\nhusbands in order to give full effect to the splendour of their\r\ncharms.[155]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xii. 5. 29.

At all events, it was of\r\nextraordinary fineness, superior, in the opinion of Suidas,[157] even to\r\nthe byssos and carbasos, or lawn of Cyprus, and appears to have been of\r\na thin, gauze-like texture, like the drapery of “woven air” which\r\nPetronius[158] throws around his female characters.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 156:\r\n\r\n  Chanaan.

To these, in order to complete the walking-dress,\r\nwas added a magnificent mantle, generally purple, embroidered with gold,\r\nwhich, being thrown negligently over the shoulders,[159] floated airily\r\nabout the person, discovering the under garments exquisitely disposed\r\nfor the purpose of displaying all the contours of the form, particularly\r\nof the waist and bosom. The Athenian ladies being, like our own,\r\npeculiarly jealous of possessing the reputation of a fine figure, and\r\nnature sometimes failing them, had recourse to art, and wore what, among\r\nmilliners, I believe, are called _bustles_.[160] I am sorry to be\r\nobliged to add, that there were, also, mothers at Athens who anticipated\r\nus in the absurdity of tight lacing, and invented corsets for the\r\npurpose of compressing the abdomen and otherwise reducing the figures of\r\ntheir daughters to some artificial standard which they had already begun\r\nto set up in defiance of nature.[161] Some women, too, when apprehensive\r\nof growing fat, would collect on fine wool a quantity of summer dew,\r\nwhich they afterwards squeezed out and drank, this liquid having been\r\nsupposed to be possessed of deleterious qualities, more particularly the\r\nascending dew.[162]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 159:\r\n\r\n  We find, from ancient monuments, that persons likewise wore over their\r\n  shoulders an article of dress exactly resembling the modern cape or\r\n  tippet.—Mus.

It was thrown tastefully over the\r\nhead, raised in front on the point of the sphendone,[163] as in modern\r\nItaly by the comb, and hung waving on the shoulders and down the back in\r\nglittering folds. But this was not the only covering they made use of\r\nfor their head. Those modern writers who have so thought are mistaken,\r\nsince it is clear, both from contemporary testimony and numerous works\r\nof art still remaining, that very frequently they wore caps or bonnets.\r\nSeveral examples occur in Mr. Hope’s work, on the Costumes of the\r\nAncients;[164] and Mnesilochos, in Aristophanes, when putting on the\r\ndisguise of a woman for the purpose of being present at the Festival of\r\nDemeter, like Clodius at that of the Bona Dea, desires to borrow from\r\nAgathon a net or mitre for the head. “Will you have my night-cap?”\r\ninquires the poet. “Exactly,” replies Euripides, “that is just what we\r\nwant.”[165]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 163:\r\n\r\n  See an exact representation of it in the Mus. Chiaramont. pl. 8, where\r\n  we likewise find an example of the sleeves closed with agraffes.—Cf.\r\n  pl. 16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 164:\r\n\r\n  Plates.

And, first, following the order of\r\nPollux, who observes no principle of classification, we have the\r\n_Epomis_, a robe with sleeves, opposed to the _Exomis_, which had none.\r\nThe _Diploïdion_, an ample cloak, or mantle, capacious enough to be worn\r\ndouble. The _Hemidiploïdion_, a more scanty mantle; the _Katastiktos_,\r\nadorned with flowers or figures of animals, or richly marked with spots,\r\nthe _Katagogis_, the _Epiblema_, or cloak, and the _Peplos_,[166] a word\r\nof very equivocal character, used to signify a veil or mantle, a\r\nsofa-carpet, or a covering for a chariot. Generally, it seems to have\r\ndesignated a garment of double the necessary size, that, at pleasure, it\r\nmight be put on, or cast, like a cloak, over the whole body, as appears\r\nfrom the Peplos of Athena.[167] That the word sometimes was used to\r\nsignify a tunic appears from Xenophon, who says “the peplos being rent\r\nabove, the bosom appeared.”[168] He, however, considers it to have\r\nformed part of the male costume.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 166:\r\n\r\n  Poll. vii. 49, seq.—The _peploma_ of Pindar (Pyth. ix. 219) is now\r\n  paploma. Wordsworth, Athens and Attica, p. 32. Cf. Iliad. ε. 315.—The\r\n  peplos was sometimes embroidered with figures.—Il. ζ. 289–295.\r\n\r\nFootnote 167:\r\n\r\n  Sch. Aristoph. Eq. 564. Poll. vii. 50.\r\n\r\nFootnote 168:\r\n\r\n  Poll. vii. 50. Cf. Cyrop. iii. 1. 13.-3. 67. In Homer, Iliad, γ. 385,\r\n  &c. the word, ἑανὸς, signifying a richly-wrought vest or robe, is\r\n  synonymous, as Pollux remarks, with πέπλος vii. 51. This is, likewise,\r\n  the opinion of Buttmann, who, however, supposes it to mean a “flexibly\r\n  soft garment.”—Lexil. Art. 41. Others draw a distinction between ἑανὸς\r\n  and πέπλος, the former, they say, being employed to signify a veil\r\n  unwrought and purely white, the latter, one which was variegated with\r\n  colours and embroidery. Passow considers it to be a mere adjective\r\n  signifying “clear, light,” and says, that εἷμα or ἱμάτιον is always\r\n  understood with it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnother article of female dress was the _Zoma_, a short vest fitting\r\nclose to the shape, and adorned at the bottom with fringe, as appears\r\nfrom a fragment of Æschylus in the Onomasticon. A character of Menander,\r\ntoo, exclaims,—“Don’t you perceive the nurse habited in her Zoma?”—for,\r\nadds Pollux, it was generally worn by old women. An elegant woollen\r\ndress, called _Parapechu_, white, but with purple sleeves, was imported\r\nfrom Corinth, and would appear to have been much worn by the\r\nHetairæ.[169] Other garments seem to have been affected by the middle\r\nclass of citizens, who, being unable to dress in purple,[170] the\r\ndistinguishing colour of the wealthy and the noble, brought into fashion\r\nthe _Paruphes_ and _Paralourges_, robes adorned on either side with a\r\npurple stripe. As much dignity is supposed to belong to ample drapery,\r\nour citizen ladies took care not to be sparing of stuff, their dresses\r\ntrailing to the ground, and displaying numerous folds, produced\r\npurposely at the extremity by a band passing round the edge. These\r\ngarments were generally of linen; but when a lady, in Homer, is said to\r\nbe wrapped in her shining mantle, the poet[171] is supposed to intend a\r\nfine, light, woollen cloak, like the white burnooses of the Tunisian and\r\nEgyptian ladies.[172]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 169:\r\n\r\n  Poll. vii. 53.

Modern ladies have delighted in\r\nflea-coloured dresses, and, in like manner, the ancients had theirs of\r\nasinine hue, called _Killios_, from a Doric name for the ass, and\r\nafterwards _Onagrinos_,[173] which, if they really resembled the wild\r\nass in hue, must have been exceedingly beautiful. There was a scarlet\r\nrobe, with the appellation of _Coccobaphes_, the _Sisys_, a thick heavy\r\ncloak, likewise called _Hyphandron Himation_, resembling the\r\n_Amphimallos_, which had a double warp, and was hairy on both\r\nsides.[174]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 173:\r\n\r\n  Among the Dorians the ass (ὄνος) was called κίλλος, and an ass-driver\r\n  (ὀνηλάτης) κιλλακτὴρ. Poll. vii. 56.\r\n\r\nFootnote 174:\r\n\r\n  Poll. vii. 56, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNot to extend this list of dresses beyond the patience of a milliner, we\r\nwill now pass on to the principal ornaments for the head,[175] in which\r\nthe Greek ladies evinced extraordinary taste and invention.[176] Among\r\nthese one of the most elegant was the _Ampyx_, a fillet by which they\r\nconfined their hair in front. It sometimes consisted of a piece of gold\r\nembroidery, the place of which was often supplied by a thin plate of\r\npure gold, studded with jewels. Another Homeric ornament, the\r\n_Kekruphalos_,[177] can only be alluded to as a critical puzzle which\r\nhas baffled all the commentators, in which predicament the _Plekte\r\nanadesme_[178] also stands; all that we know being, that it found its\r\nplace in the female head-dress, though whether as a mitre or a diadem\r\nApollonios is unable to determine. It may possibly have been, under\r\nanother appellation, that graceful wreath or garland, consisting of\r\nfragrant flowers interwoven or bound together by their stems, described\r\namong female ornaments by Pollux.[179]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 175:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Vascul. i.\r\n  87.—The κεκρύφαλος, or κροκύφαντος,, which occurs once in the Iliad,\r\n  was a female ornament for the head, unknown to the later Greeks. The\r\n  scholiast describes it as κόσμος τὶς περὶ κεφαλήν; and Damm observes\r\n  that, it was “redimiculam _vel_ reticulam quo mulieres crines\r\n  coërcent.”—1158. Heyne is equally unsatisfactory. The commentators on\r\n  Pollux. v. 95, avoid the subject altogether. Cf. Foës. Œcon. Hippoc.\r\n  p. 202.\r\n\r\nFootnote 178:\r\n\r\n  Iliad, χ. 469. Πλεκτὴ ἀναδέσμη· οἱ μὲν διάδημα, says Apollonios, οἱ δὲ\r\n  μίτραν. Πλὴν κοσμου εἶδος περὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν. This is the basis of\r\n  Hesychius’ article. The Leyden scholia say:—ἀναδέσμη λέγεται, σειρὰ,\r\n  ἥν περὶ τοὺς κροτάφους ἀναδοῦνται· καλεῖται δ᾽ ὑπ’ ἑνίων καλανδάκη.\r\n  (In which Heyne imagines we may detect _calantica_, “a hood, hurlet,\r\n  or coif.”) Κρήδεμνον δὲ πάλιν τὸ μαφόριον.\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:\r\n\r\n  Poll. v. 96. Iliad. σ. 595. In Homer the epithet, however, is not\r\n  πλεκτὴ but καλὴ. Hemsterhuis ad Poll. t. iv. p. 998.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnother article of the same ambiguous character was the _Pylæon_,\r\nsupposed to have derived its name from φύλον, _a leaf_. Athenæus,[180]\r\non a subject of this kind, perhaps, one of the best authorities,\r\ndescribes it as the crown which, during certain festivals, the Spartans\r\nplaced upon the head of Hera. Doubtless, however, the most tasteful and\r\nelegant of this class of female ornaments was the _Kalyx_, a golden\r\nsyrinx or reed, passed like a ring over each several tress to keep it\r\nseparate.[181] Eustathius describes it as a ring resembling a\r\nfull-blown, but not expanded, rose; and this explanation will not be\r\ninconsistent with that of Hesychius, if we suppose the golden tubes to\r\nhave terminated in the form of that flower. The _Strophion_ was a band\r\nor fillet[182] with which women confined their hair, as we discover from\r\nmany ancient statues. Parrhasios the artist, who used to bind his\r\nluxuriant locks with a white strophion, was therefore accused of\r\neffeminacy.[183] The name, however, appears to have been applied to any\r\nkind of band, even to the broad belt worn to support the bosom: “My\r\nstrophion being untied the walnuts fell out,” says the girl in\r\nAristophanes.[184] There was also an ornament of the same name worn by\r\npriests.[185]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:\r\n\r\n  Deipnosoph. xv. 22.

Its proper name\r\n_sphendone_ it derived from its resemblance to a sling, being broad and\r\nelevated in front,[187] and terminating in narrow points at the back of\r\nthe head where it was tied. On the comic stage it was sometimes worn for\r\nsport with the fore part behind.[188] The _Anadesma_[189] was a gilded\r\nfillet or diadem of gold, used like the _strophion_ for encircling the\r\nforehead. What was the precise use or form of the _Xanion_, another\r\ngolden ornament fashionable in remote antiquity, could not be\r\nascertained in the age of Pollux, who says that many writers supposed it\r\nto have been a comb. Of this number are Hesychius, Suidas,[190] and\r\nPhavorinus. But a learned modern conjectures with more probability, that\r\nit was some talismanic idol worn as a spell against the evil eye.[191]\r\nIn fact it is expressly observed in the Etymologicon Magnum,[192] that\r\nthe Hellenic women reckoned it among their phylacteries.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:\r\n\r\n  Clem.

The\r\nmost ancient kind were called _Hermata_, of which mention occurs both in\r\nthe Iliad and the Odyssey.[193] They were usually adorned with three\r\nemerald drops,[194] for which reason they were by the Athenians\r\ndenominated _Triopia_ or _Triopides_,[195] and by the other Greeks\r\n_Triopthalma_ or “the triple eye.” By this word, as an ancient\r\ngrammarian informs us, some understood an animal like the beetle,\r\nsupposed to have three eyes, whence a necklace with three hyaline or\r\ncrystal eyes, depending from it in front, was likewise called by the\r\nsame name. Pollux[196] supposed the earrings of Hera to have been\r\nadorned with three diminutive figures in precious stones, or gold,\r\nprobably of goddesses. The _Diopos_ seems to have been an earring with\r\ntwo drops. The _Helix_ appears in Homer[197] rather to mean an earring\r\nthan an armlet, and to have received its name from its circular shape or\r\ncurvature; but the spiral gold rings round the walking-stick of\r\nParrhasios are also called _Helices_ by Athenæus.[198] Another name for\r\nthis sort of earring was _Heliktes_.[199] In the Æolic dialect earrings\r\nwere called _Siglai_, in the Doric _Artiala_. A particular kind\r\ndenominated _Enclastridia_ and _Strobelia_, by the comic poets, had gold\r\ndrops in the form of a pine cone.[200] Two very curious kinds of\r\nearrings were the _Caryatides_, and the _Hippocampia_, the former\r\nrepresenting in miniature the architectural figures, so called, the\r\nlatter little horses with tails ending in a fish. There were earrings,\r\nlikewise, with drops in the forms of centaurs and other fantastic\r\ncreations.[201]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 193:\r\n\r\n  Il. ξ. 182. Odys. σ. 296. Ælian. Var.

This\r\nbeing the most fashionable necklace was known under a variety of names,\r\nas the _Kathema_, and _Katheter_, and _Mannos_ or _Monnos_, among the\r\nDorians.[206]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. σ. 290.

Some worn\r\nabove the elbow were denominated _Brachionia_, others called\r\n_Pericarpia_, or _Echinoi_ encircled the wrists and were often in the\r\nform of twisted snakes of gold, which the woman-hater in Lucian would\r\nhave converted into real serpents.[207] The _Psellia_ or chain bracelets\r\nwere much worn; the _Clidones_ adorned the rich and luxurious only. As\r\nstockings were not in common use, and shoes and sandals frequently\r\ndispensed with when within doors, fashion required that the feet and\r\nankles should not remain unadorned. Ancient writers, accordingly,\r\nenumerate several kinds of anklets, or bangles, all of gold, and varying\r\nonly in form, the distinction between which I have been unable to\r\ndiscover. The _Ægle,_ the _Pede_ and the _Periscelides_ were so many\r\nornaments for the instep or ankle.[208]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 207:\r\n\r\n  Amor. § 41.\r\n\r\nFootnote 208:\r\n\r\n  Poll. v. 100. Golden periscelides are enumerated by Longus l. i. among\r\n  the possessions of the young Lesbian girl; and Horace, Epist. i. xvii.\r\n  56, speaks of the periscelis being snatched away from a courtezan.\r\n  Here Dr. Bentley understands the word to mean _tibialia_, and\r\n  observes,—“delicatulæ fasciolis involvebant sibi crura et femora.” But\r\n  Gesner ad Horat. p. 503, seq. rather supposes “compedes mulierum,” to\r\n  be intended, and he is probably right. Cf. Petron. Sat. c. 67.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAmong the ornaments for the bosom we find the _Ægis_, evidently like the\r\nægis of Athena, a sort of rich covering with two hemispherical caps to\r\nreceive the breasts, such as we find worn by the Bayadères of the\r\nDekkan. Extending from this on either side, or passing over its lower\r\nedge was the _Maschalister_, a broad belt which covered the armpits,\r\nthough in Herodotus the word merely signifies a sword-belt.[209]\r\n\r\nLike all other delicate and luxurious women, the Grecian ladies\r\ndisplayed upon their fingers a profusion of rings, of which some were\r\nset with signets, others with jewels remarkable for their colour and\r\nbrilliance. To each of these their copious language supplied a distinct\r\nname.[210] Other female ornaments are spoken of by the comic poets; but\r\nin their descriptions it is difficult to distinguish satire from\r\ninformation. Among these were the _Leroi_, golden drops attached to the\r\ntunic; the _Ochthoiboi_, which seem to have been a sort of rich tassels;\r\nthe _Helleboroi_, ornaments shaped perhaps like the leaves or flowers of\r\nthat plant; and the _Pompholuges_, which, though left unexplained by the\r\ncommentators, probably signified a large clear kind of bead, as the word\r\noriginally meant a “water-bubble,” which a transparent bead\r\nresembles.[211]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 209:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Sometimes, perhaps, the\r\nfashion only and the name were imported, as in the case of the Persian\r\nhalf-boot, fitting tight to the ankle.[213] The same thing may probably\r\nbe said of the Sicyonian slipper. But there was an elegant sandal,\r\nornamented with gold, which, down to a very late period, continued to be\r\nimported from Patara, in Lycia.[214] Snow-white slippers of fine linen,\r\nflowered with needlework, were occasionally worn; and from many ancient\r\nstatues it would seem, that something very like stockings had been\r\nalready introduced. Short women, desirous of adding, if not a cubit, at\r\nleast a few inches to their stature, adopted the use of _baukides_ with\r\nhigh cork heels, and soles of great thickness.[215]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 212:\r\n\r\n  Diog.

Poll. vii. 94.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAn Athenian beauty usually spent the whole morning in the important\r\nbusiness of the toilette.[216] The crowd of maids who attended on these\r\noccasions appears to have exceeded in number the assistants at similar\r\nrites in a modern dressing-room, the principle of the division of labour\r\nhaving been pushed to its greatest extent. Like Hera, who was said by\r\nmythologists to renew her virgin charms as often as she bathed in the\r\nfountain of Canathos,[217] the Attic lady appeared to undergo diurnal\r\nrejuvenescence under the hands of her maids.[218] Her lovely face grew\r\ntenfold more lovely by their arts. Clustering in interesting groups\r\naround her, some held the silver basin and ewer, others the boxes of\r\ntooth-powder, or black paint for the eyebrows, the rouge pots or the\r\nblanching varnish, the essence-bottles or the powder for the head, the\r\njewel-cases or the mirrors.[219] But on nothing was so much care\r\nbestowed as on the hair.[220] Auburn, the colour of Aphrodite’s\r\ntresses[221] in Homer, being considered most beautiful,[222] drugs were\r\ninvented in which the hair being dipped, and exposed to the noon-day\r\nsun, it acquired the coveted hue, and fell in golden curls over their\r\nshoulders.[223] Others, contented with their own black hair, exhausted\r\ntheir ingenuity in augmenting its rich gloss, steeping it in oils and\r\nessences, till all the fragrance of Arabia seemed to breathe around\r\nthem. Those waving ringlets which we admire in their sculpture were\r\noften the creation of art, being produced by curling-irons heated in\r\nashes;[224] after which, by the aid of jewelled fillets and golden pins,\r\nthey were brought forward over the smooth white forehead,[225] which\r\nthey sometimes shaded to the eyebrows, leaving a small ivory space in\r\nthe centre, while behind they floated in shining profusion down the\r\nback. When decked in this manner, and dressed for the harem[226] in\r\ntheir light flowered sandals and semi-transparent robes already\r\ndescribed, they were scarcely farther removed from the state of nature\r\nthan the Spartan maids themselves.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 216:\r\n\r\n  Their perfumes and essences were kept in alabaster boxes from\r\n  Phœnicia, some of which cost no more than two drachmæ.—Lucian, Diall.\r\n  Meret. xiv. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 217:\r\n\r\n  Paus. ii. 37, 38.\r\n\r\nFootnote 218:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph.

Meret. i.\r\n\r\nFootnote 226:\r\n\r\n  A taste not greatly dissimilar presides over the in-door dress of the\r\n  modern Greek women. “In the gynecæum,” says Chandler, “the girl, like\r\n  Thetis, treading on a soft carpet, has her white and delicate feet\r\n  naked; the nails tinged with red. Her trowsers, which in winter are of\r\n  red cloth, and in summer of fine calico or thin gauze, descend from\r\n  the hip to the ankle, hanging loosely about her limbs, the lower\r\n  portion embroidered with flowers, and appearing beneath the shift,\r\n  which has the sleeves wide and open, and the seams and edges curiously\r\n  adorned with needlework. Her vest is of silk, exactly fitted to the\r\n  form of the bosom and the shape of the body, which it rather covers\r\n  than conceals, and is shorter than the shift. The sleeves button\r\n  occasionally to the hand, and are lined with red or yellow satin. A\r\n  rich zone encompasses her waist, and is fastened before by clasps of\r\n  silver gilded, or of gold, set with precious stones. Over the vest is\r\n  a robe, in summer lined with ermine, and in cold weather with fur. The\r\n  head-dress is a skull-cap, red or green, with pearls; a stay under the\r\n  chin, and a yellow fore-head cloth, She has bracelets of gold on her\r\n  wrists; and, like Aurora, is rosy-fingered, the tips being stained.\r\n  Her necklace is a string of zechins, a species of gold coin, or of the\r\n  pieces called Byzantines. At her cheeks is a lock of hair made to curl\r\n  toward the face; and down her back falls a profusion of tresses,\r\n  spreading over her shoulders.”—ii. 140.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nContrary to the fashion prevalent in modern times the bosom, however,\r\nwas always closely covered, because being extremely full shaped it began\r\nvery early to lose its firmness and beauty.[227] Earrings, set with\r\nRed-Sea pearls of great price, depended from their ears, and an\r\norbicular crown studded with Indian jewels surmounted and contrasted\r\nstrikingly with their dark locks. Add to these the jewelled throat\r\nbands, and costly and glittering necklaces. Their cheeks though\r\nsometimes pale by nature, blushed with rouge,[228] and they even\r\npossessed the art to superinduce over this artificial complexion that\r\npeach-like purple bloom which belongs to the very earliest, dewiest dawn\r\nof beauty. To the tint of the rose they could likewise add that of the\r\nlily. White paint was in common use,[229] not merely among unmarried\r\nwomen, and ladies of equivocal reputation, but with matrons the chastest\r\nand most prudent in Athens, for we find that pattern of an Attic\r\ngentlewoman, the wife of Ischomachos, practising after marriage every\r\ndelusive art of the toilette.[230]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 227:\r\n\r\n  Lucian.

For it is highly\r\nerroneous to transfer to Athens the ideas of female seclusion acquired\r\nfrom travellers in the East, where no such rigid seclusion was ever\r\nknown. Husbands, indeed, who had cause, or supposed they had, to be\r\njealous, might be put on the rack by beholding the crowds of admirers\r\nwho flocked around their wives the moment they issued into the streets.\r\nBut there was no remedy. The laws and customs of the country often\r\nforced the women abroad to assist at processions and perform their\r\ndevotions at the shrines of various goddesses.[232]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 231:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

In the country, too,\r\n  women went often abroad, and evidently led a very comfortable life;\r\n  their habits, in fact, greatly resembled those of English country\r\n  ladies; the wives of men whose estates lay contiguous freely visiting\r\n  and gossiping with each other. Thus in the action on the damage caused\r\n  by the torrent, we find the wife of Tisias and the mother of Callicles\r\n  discussing the spoiling of the barley and the barley meal, and\r\n  meeting, evidently, as often as they thought proper. In fact, before\r\n  the quarrel, the footpath across the field was clearly well\r\n  worn.—Demosth. in Call. § 7.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe dress of men included many of the garments worn by women; for\r\nexample, the chiton of which there were several kinds, some with and\r\nsome without sleeves. Among the latter was the _Exomis_,[233] a short\r\ntunic worn by aged men and slaves, but the name was sometimes applied to\r\na garment thrown loosely round the body, and to the chiton with one\r\nsleeve.[234] Over this in Homeric times was worn as a defence against\r\nthe cold, the _Chlaina_[235] a cloak strongly resembling a highlander’s\r\ntartan, or the burnoose of the Bedouin Arab. It was, in fact, a square\r\npiece of cloth, occasionally with the corners rounded off, which,\r\npassing over the left shoulder, and under the right arm, was again\r\nthrown over the left shoulder, leaving the spear arm free.[236] This is\r\nwhat the poet means where he terms the _Chlaina_ double. It was wrapped\r\ntwice round the breast, and fastened over the left shoulder by a\r\nbrooch.[237] Even this, however, was not deemed sufficient in very cold\r\nweather, and a cloak of skins sown together with thongs was wrapped\r\nabout the body as a defence against the rain or snow. Some persons\r\nappear to have worn skin-cloaks all the year round, for we find\r\nAnaxagoras, in the midst of summer at Olympia, putting on his when he\r\nforesaw there would be rain.[238] Rustics also appear to have considered\r\na tunic and skin-cloak necessary to complete their costume.[239]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 233:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph.

In this mode of clothing, a modern author\r\nremarks, a peculiar taste was displayed, an antique simplicity “equally\r\nremoved from the splendour of Asiatics, and the uncleanliness of\r\nbarbarians.”[240] They preserved the use of the Homeric chiton, or\r\nwoollen shirt, and over this wore also the _Chlaina_ or _Himation_, in\r\nthe manner described above. To these was added the _Chlamys_, which, as\r\nthe Spartan laws prohibited dyeing, was universally white, and\r\ndenominated _Hololeukos_.[241]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 240:\r\n\r\n  Müller.

At Athens it was regarded as a mark of effeminacy, and was\r\nfastened with a gold or jewelled brooch on the breast.[243]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 242:\r\n\r\n  Σαπφὼ πρώτη γὰρ μέμνηται τῆς χλαμύδος.—Ammonius, p. 147. Valcken.\r\n\r\nFootnote 243:\r\n\r\n  Heliodor. i. and ii.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe men of Sparta, though less thinly clad than the women, still went\r\nabroad very scantily covered. Their _Tribon_, a variety of the\r\nhimation,[244] like the cloak of the poor Spanish gentleman, was clipped\r\nso close that it would barely enclose their persons, like a case, but\r\nwas thick and heavy, and calculated to last. Accordingly, the youth were\r\nallowed only one of these per annum, so that, in warm weather, it is\r\nprobable that, with an eye to saving it for winter, they exchanged it\r\nfor that more lasting coat with which nature had furnished them.[245] In\r\nthe towns, however, and as often as they thought proper to put on the\r\nappearance of extreme modesty, the young Spartans drew close their\r\ncloaks around them so as to conceal their hands,[246] the exhibiting of\r\nwhich has always been regarded as a mark of vulgarity. Hence the use of\r\ngloves, and the affectation of soft white hands in modern times. The\r\nsame notions prevail even among the Turks, who, like Laertes in Homer,\r\nwear long sleeves to their pelisses for the purpose of defending the\r\nhand, to have which white and well-shaped is among them a mark of noble\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 244:\r\n\r\n  Sch. Aristoph. Nub. 415. Cf. Vesp. 116, 475.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Spartans had the good taste to suffer their beards and hair to grow\r\nlong, and were at much pains to render them glossy and shining. Even in\r\nthe field, contrary to the practice at Athens, they preserved this\r\nnatural ornament of their heads, and we find them busy in combing and\r\nputting it in order on the very eve of battle.[247] It was usually\r\nparted at the top, and was, in fact, the most becoming covering\r\nimaginable. But they set little value on cleanliness, and bathed and\r\nperfumed themselves seldom, being evidently of opinion,[248] that a\r\nbrave man ought not to be too spruce. However, having no object to gain\r\nby aping the exterior of mendicants, they eschewed the wearing of ragged\r\ncloaks, which, indeed, was forbidden by law.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 245:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

Wealthy, and fond of\r\nshow, they delighted in a style of dress in the highest degree curious\r\nand magnificent, appearing abroad in flowing robes of the finest linen,\r\ndyed with purple and other brilliant colours.[249] Beneath these they\r\nwore tunics of various kinds, which, though the fashion afterwards\r\nchanged, were at first sleeveless, since we find the women, in\r\nAristophanes, suffering the hair to grow under their arm-pits to avoid\r\nbeing discovered when, disguised as their husbands, they should hold up\r\ntheir hands to vote in the assembly.[250]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 249:\r\n\r\n  Thucyd. i. 6.

Thus, in Lucian, we find\r\n  Parmenon, the servant of Polemon, with a ring of this kind on his\r\n  little finger.—Diall. Meret. ix. 2. Cf. Hemster. ad Poll. ix. 96. t.\r\n  vi. p. 1193.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn his girdle and shoes,[252] too, the Athenian betrayed his love of\r\nsplendour. The hair worn long like that of the ladies,[253] was curled\r\nor braided and built up in glossy masses on the crown of the head, or\r\narranged artfully along the forehead by golden grasshoppers.[254] But as\r\nall this pile of ringlets could not be thrust into the helmet, it was\r\ncustomary in time of war to cut the hair short, which the fashionable\r\nyoung men reckoned among its most serious hardships. Hats[255] were not\r\nhabitually worn, though on journeys or promenades undertaken during hot\r\nweather they formed a necessary part of the costume. Above all things\r\nthe Athenian citizen affected extreme cleanliness and neatness in his\r\nperson, and the same taste descended even to the slaves who in the\r\nstreets could scarcely be distinguished by dress, hair, or ornaments,\r\nfrom their masters.[256]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 252:\r\n\r\n  Poll. vii. 92, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 253:\r\n\r\n  Casaub. ad Theoph.

Your truly wise man, says an unexceptionable\r\nwitness in a matter of this kind, has his hair closely shaved, (this was\r\nan eastern innovation,) but suffers his magnificent beard to fall in\r\nwavy curls over his breast. His shoes, fitting tight as wax, are\r\nsupported by a net-work of thongs, disposed at equal distances up the\r\nsmall of the leg. A chlamys puffed out effeminately at the breast\r\nconceals his figure, and like a foreigner he leans contemplatively upon\r\nhis staff.[257]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 257:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xi. 120.

Some persons, he says, appeared in robes of a violet,\r\nothers of a purple, others of a saffron colour, sprinkled with dusky\r\nlozenges. As at Athens, much attention was bestowed on the hair, which\r\nthey adorned with small ornamental figures. Their vests were yellow,\r\nlike a ripe quince, or purple, or crimson, or pure white. Even their\r\ntunics, imported from Corinth, were of the finest texture, and of the\r\nrichest dyes, hyacinthine or violet, flame-coloured or deep sea-green.\r\nOthers adopted the Persian _calasiris_,[258] of all tunics the most\r\nsuperb, and there were those among the opulent who even affected the\r\nPersian _actœa_, a shawl-mantle of the costliest and most gorgeous\r\nappearance. It was formed of a close-woven, but light stuff, bedropped\r\nwith golden beads in the form of millet-seed, which were connected with\r\nthe tissue by slender eyes passing through the stuff and fastened by a\r\npurple thread.[259]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 258:\r\n\r\n  We find mention made of Persian dresses variegated with the figures of\r\n  animals.

The words of Asios preserved in the Deipnosophist\r\nare as follow: “Thus proceed they to the fane of Hera, clothed in\r\nmagnificent robes, with snowy pelisses, trailing behind them on the\r\nground. Glistening ornaments of gold, like grasshoppers, surmount the\r\ncrown of their heads, while their luxuriant tresses float behind in the\r\nwind, intermingled with golden chains. Bracelets of variegated\r\nworkmanship adorn their arms, as the warrior is adorned by his shield\r\nthongs.”[260] This excess of effeminate luxury, attended as everywhere\r\nelse by enervating vices, terminated in the ruin of Samos. Similar\r\nmanners in the Colophonians drew upon them a similar fate, and so in\r\nevery other Grecian community; for men never learn wisdom by the example\r\nof others, but hurry on in the career of indulgence as if in the hope\r\nthat Providence might overlook them, or set aside, in their favour, its\r\neternal laws.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 260:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xii. 30.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n                           PRIVATE DWELLINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opinion appears to prevail among certain writers, that the private\r\ndwellings of the Hellenes, or at least of the Athenians, were always\r\nmean and insignificant.[261] This imaginary fact they account for by\r\nsupposing, that nobles and opulent citizens were deterred from indulging\r\nin the luxuries of architecture by the form of government and the\r\nenvious jealousy of the common people. But such a view of the matter is\r\ninconsistent with the testimony of history. At Athens, as everywhere\r\nelse, things followed their natural course. In the early ages of the\r\ncommonwealth, when manners were simple, the houses of the greatest men\r\nin the state differed very little from those of their neighbours. As\r\nwealth, however, and luxury increased, together with the developement of\r\nthe democratic principle, individuals erected themselves mansions vying\r\nin extent and splendour with the public edifices of the state;[262] and\r\nas the polity degenerated more and more into ochlocracy, the dwellings\r\nof the rich[263] increased in size and grandeur, until they at length\r\noutstripped the very temples of the gods. A similar process took place\r\nat Sparta, where shortly after the Peloponnesian war, the more\r\ndistinguished citizens possessed suburban villas, which seem to have\r\nbeen of spacious dimensions and filled with costly furniture.[264]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 261:\r\n\r\n  But even from a fragment of Bacchylides we may infer the magnificence\r\n  of Grecian houses; for the poor man who drinks wine, he says, sees his\r\n  house blazing with gold and ivory:\r\n\r\n                         χρυσῷ δ᾽ ἐλεφαντί τε\r\n                         μαρμαίρουσιν οἶκοι.\r\n                                   Athen. ii. 10.\r\n\r\n  Men had by this time advanced considerably from the state in which\r\n  they are supposed to have built their huts in imitation of the\r\n  swallow’s nest.

It would\r\nhave been more satisfactory to find them preserving, in every period of\r\ntheir history, the stern and lofty simplicity of republican manners, far\r\noutshining in the eyes of the philosopher the palaces of Oriental kings\r\nglittering with gold and ivory and jewels, insomuch that the cottage of\r\nSocrates, erected in the humblest style of Athenian domestic\r\narchitecture, would be an object, were it still in existence, of far\r\ndeeper interest to the genuine lover of antiquity than the mansions of\r\nMeidias or Callias, or even than the imperial abodes of Semiramis,\r\nDarius, and Artaxerxes.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, wherever there exists opulence, it will exhibit itself in\r\nthe erection of stately dwellings; and accordingly we find that, prior\r\neven to the Trojan war,[265] commerce and increasing luxury had already\r\ninspired the Greeks with a taste for splendour and magnificence, which\r\ndisplayed itself especially in the architecture and ornaments of their\r\npalaces and houses of the great.[266]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 265:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

The great entrance gates were in the heroic ages\r\nguarded by ban dogs,[270] which afterwards made way for porters,[271]\r\nand in still later times were succeeded by eunuchs.[272]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 268:\r\n\r\n  A similar taste prevailed among the Merovingian princes of France:\r\n  “The mansion of the long-haired kings was surrounded with convenient\r\n  yards and stables for the cattle and the poultry; the garden was\r\n  planted with useful vegetables; the various trades, the labours of\r\n  agriculture, and even the arts of hunting and fishing were exercised\r\n  by servile hands for the emolument of the sovereign; his magazines\r\n  were filled with corn and wine, either for sale or consumption, and\r\n  the whole administration was conducted by the strictest maxims of\r\n  private economy.”—Gibbon, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, ii.\r\n  356.\r\n\r\nFootnote 269:\r\n\r\n  Hesych. v. αὐλῆς.\r\n\r\nFootnote 270:\r\n\r\n  Feith.

Within, on either side the\r\ngateway,[275] chiefly among the Dorians, rose a pillar of conical shape,\r\nsometimes an obelisk, in honour of Apollo or of Dionysos, or, according\r\nto others, of both, while in the centre was an altar of Zeus Herceios,\r\non which family sacrifices were offered up.[276] At its inner extremity\r\nyou beheld a spacious portico, adjoining the entrance to the house,\r\nwhere in warm weather the young men often slept. From the descriptions\r\nof the poet, however, it would appear to have been something more than a\r\ncommon portico, resembling rather the porches of our old English houses,\r\nroofed over and extending like a recess into the body of the house\r\nitself. In the dwellings of the great, this part of the building,\r\nadorned with numerous statues, was probably of marble finely polished if\r\nnot sculptured, and being merely a chamber open in front could not in\r\nthose fine climates be by any means an unpleasant bedroom, particularly\r\nas it usually faced the south and caught the early rays of the sun. Here\r\nOdysseus[277] slept during his stay with Alcinoös, as did likewise Priam\r\nand the Trojan Herald while guests of Achilles in his military hut.[278]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 275:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

In the\r\nlarger towns of Nubia an open space planted with dates, palms, or the\r\nEgyptian fig-tree, more shady and spreading than the oak, and furnished\r\nwith wooden seats, collects together the elders, who there enjoy what\r\nthe Englishman seeks in his club, and the Greek found in his lesche—the\r\npleasure of comparing his opinions with those of his neighbours.\r\n\r\nWhen, in after times, this plain porch had been succeeded by a\r\nmagnificent peristyle or colonnade, the primitive custom of sleeping in\r\nthe open air was abandoned; but here the master of the house with his\r\nguests took their early walk to enjoy the morning sun. It was customary\r\namong all ranks at Athens to rise betimes, as it generally is still in\r\nthe warm countries of the South. Socrates and his young friend, the\r\nsophist-hunter,[280] coming to the house of Callias, soon after\r\nday-break, find its owner taking the air with several of his guests in\r\nthe colonnade, the young men moving in the train of their elders, and\r\nmaking way for them as they turn round to retrace their steps. There was\r\nusually at Athens a similar peristyle on both sides of the house—one for\r\nsummer the other for winter, and a door generally opened from the\r\nwomen’s apartment into that communicating with the garden, where the\r\nladies enjoyed the cool air in the midst of laurel copses, fountains,\r\nand patches of green sward,[281] interspersed with rose-trees,\r\nviolet-beds, and other sweet shrubs and flowers.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 279:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. γ. 406, sqq.

The walls were covered\r\nwith wainscoting inlaid with gold and ivory, as we still find in the\r\nEast whole chambers lined with mother-of-pearl.[287] At first, the gold\r\nwas laid on in thin plates, which, in process of time, led to the idea\r\nof gilding.[288] Even Phocion, who affected great simplicity and\r\nplainness, had the walls of his house adorned with laminæ of\r\ncopper,[289] probably in the same style as that subterraneous chamber\r\ndiscovered, during the last century, in the excavations made at Rome. It\r\nappears, too, that, occasionally, the walls of the apartments at Athens,\r\nas at Herculaneum and Pompeii were decorated with paintings in bright\r\ncolours,[290] probably in the same style, though as much superior in\r\nbeauty and delicacy of execution, as art, in the age of Pericles, was\r\nsuperior to art in the days of Nero. Still the paintings discovered in\r\nthe excavated Italian cities,—sometimes[291] grotesque and extravagant,\r\nas where we behold the pigmies making war upon the cranes, winged\r\ngeniuses at work in a carpenter’s or shoemaker’s shop, or an ass laden\r\nwith hampers of wine, rushing forward to engage a crocodile, whilst his\r\nmaster pulls him back by the tail—sometimes rural and elegant,\r\nconsisting of a series of wild landscapes, mountains dotted with\r\ncottages, sea-shores, harbours, and baths, Nymphs and Cupids angling on\r\nthe borders of lakes, beneath trees of the softest and most exquisite\r\nfoliage,—may enable us to form some conception of the landscapes with\r\nwhich Agelarcos[292] adorned the house of Alcibiades.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 287:\r\n\r\n  Lady Montague’s Works, ii. 234.\r\n\r\nFootnote 288:\r\n\r\n  Plin. xxxiii. 18.

No mention, I believe, is made in Greek\r\nauthors of lining the walls of apartments with glass, or even of glass\r\nwindows,[296] which, however, were common in the cities of Magna Græcia\r\nin the age immediately succeeding that of our Saviour. It is extremely\r\nprobable, however, that as the Greeks were as well acquainted as the\r\nRomans with the properties of the lapis specularis;[297] they likewise\r\nmade use of thin plates of this stone, or talc, or gypsum, as they still\r\ndo in Egypt for window-panes. So much, indeed, seems inferable from a\r\npassage of Plutarch,[298] as, also, that transparent squares of horn\r\nwere employed for the same purpose, as oyster-shells and oiled paper\r\nstill are in China. Previously, however, the windows[299] (sometimes\r\nsquare and situated high in the wall, sometimes reaching from the\r\nceiling to the floor) were closed with lattice-work[300] in iron,\r\nbronze, or wood, over which, in bad weather, blinds of hair-cloth or\r\nprepared leather were usually drawn.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 293:\r\n\r\n  Plin. xxxvi. 60.

Somewhere in the more retired parts of the Domos were the\r\npicture-gallery and library, of neither of which have we any exact\r\ndescription. The former, however, faced the north, and the latter the\r\nwest. If the libraries of the Greeks at all resembled in form and\r\ndimensions those found at Pompeii, they were by no means spacious;\r\nneither, in fact, was a great deal of room necessary, as the manuscripts\r\nof the ancients stowed away much closer than our modern books,[309] and\r\nwere sometimes kept in circular boxes, of elegant form, with covers of\r\nturned wood. The volumes consisted of rolls of parchment, sometimes\r\npurple at the back,[310] or papyrus, about twelve or fourteen inches in\r\nbreadth, and as many feet long as the subject required. The pages formed\r\na number of transverse compartments, commencing at the left, and\r\nproceeding in order to the other extremity, and the reader, holding in\r\neither hand one end of the manuscript, unrolled and rolled it up[311] as\r\nhe read. Occasionally these books were placed on shelves, in piles, with\r\nthe ends outwards, adorned with golden bosses,[312] the titles of the\r\nvarious treatises being written on pendant labels.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 305:\r\n\r\n  Id. η. 95, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 306:\r\n\r\n  Id. θ. 65. π. 32.\r\n\r\nFootnote 307:\r\n\r\n  Id. κ. 352, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 308:\r\n\r\n  Lucian, Luc. siv.

Thus, in\r\nthe palace of Ithaca, Telemachos had a bed-chamber on the second story,\r\nwhence the poet is careful to observe he enjoyed a good prospect.[314]\r\nIn later times, however, there were, on the ground floor, suites of\r\napartments, denominated Xenon, appropriated to the use of guests, who\r\nthere lived freely and at ease as in their own houses.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 313:\r\n\r\n  Similar courts in the houses of Magna Græcia are described as having\r\n  had in the middle a square tank where the rain-water was collected,\r\n  and ran into a reservoir beneath.—Sir W. Hamilt. Acc. of Discov. at\r\n  Pomp. p. 13.\r\n\r\nFootnote 314:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. α. 425. seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAt the further extremity of the interior court a steep flight of steps\r\nled to an elevated basement and doorway, which formed the entrance into\r\nthe thalamos.[315] This part of the house would appear to have been laid\r\nout in a peculiar manner, consisting, first, of a lofty and spacious\r\napartment,[316] where all the females of the family usually sat while\r\nengaged in embroidery or other needlework.[317] It likewise formed the\r\nnursery, and, at its inner extremity, in a deep recess, the bed of the\r\nmistress of the family appears to have stood, on either side of which\r\nwere doors leading to flights of steps into the garden, set apart for\r\nthe use of the women.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 315:\r\n\r\n  Eustath. ad Odyss. χ. p. 776.—These female apartments were sometimes\r\n  hired out and inhabited by men.—Antiph. Nec. Venef. § 3.—Mr.\r\n  Fosbroke’s account is curious:—“The thalamos was an apartment where\r\n  the _mothers of families_ worked in embroidery, in tapestry, and other\r\n  works, _with their wives_, or their friends.”—Encyclop. of Ant. i. 50.\r\n\r\nFootnote 316:\r\n\r\n  Sometimes, at least, roofed with cypress-wood, as we learn from\r\n  Mnesimachos, in his Horsebreeder: βαίν’ ἐκ θαλάμων κυπαρισσορόφων ἔξω,\r\n  Μάνη.—Athen. ix. 67.\r\n\r\nFootnote 317:\r\n\r\n  We find ladies, however, sometimes dining with their children in the\r\n  Aulè.—Demosth. in Ev. et Mnes. § 16.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt has by many been supposed, that the Thalamos was a chamber\r\nparticularly appropriated to the use of young unmarried ladies; but,\r\nsince we find Helen and Penelope inhabiting the Thalamos, it may be\r\npresumed that it was common to all the females of the house. Hector, in\r\nhis visit to Paris, finds him in the Thalamos, turning about and\r\npolishing his arms, as if he meant to use them, while, close at hand,\r\nare Helen and her maids engaged in weaving or embroidery. The word was\r\noften used in the same signification as Gynæconitis,[318] or “the\r\nharem;” and, therefore, when Theocritus[319] speaks of a “maiden from\r\nthe Thalamus,” and Phocylides, with the suspicious caution of a more\r\nvicious age, advises that young women be kept in “well-locked Thalamoi,”\r\nit is clear that the female apartments generally are meant. These were,\r\nin Sparta, called οα̈ (which, as is well known, in the common language\r\nof Greece, signifies eggs), whence, according to Clearchos,[320] the\r\nfable which describes Helen proceeding from an egg, because born and\r\neducated in the chambers so called. Throughout the Iliad and the Odyssey\r\nwe find the poet speaking of this part of the house as inhabited by\r\nwomen. Here lived Penelope,[321] far from the brawls of the suitors who\r\ncrowded the halls of the Domos; and here Ares pressed his suit with\r\nsuccess to Astyoche and Polymela, who both became the mothers of valiant\r\nsons.[322] From which, among many other circumstances, it is manifest\r\nthat, in those ages, the sexes met easily, even the entrance to the\r\nharem not being impracticable to a lover.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 318:\r\n\r\n  Hesych, v. γυναίκ. p. 866.

At Athens, the door of communication between the Andron[323]\r\nand the Gynæconitis was kept carefully barred and locked to prevent all\r\nintercourse between the male and female slaves, the keys being entrusted\r\nsolely to the mistress of the house.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 323:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Poll. vi. 7. Cœl. Rhodig. xvii. 24.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs these apartments were less exposed than any other portion of the\r\nbuilding, and far more carefully guarded, it became customary, as in the\r\nEast it still is, to lay up in the Thalamos, more especially in the dark\r\nbasement story, much valuable property, such as arms, gold, silver, the\r\nwardrobe of both sexes, and even oil and wine. Among the Romans, or,\r\nindeed, among the Greeks, of a later age,[324] this step would scarcely\r\nhave been taken, lest the ladies should have grown too assiduous in\r\ntheir attention to the skins. But in remoter ages these sordid fears had\r\nno existence. Accordingly, we find the prudent Odysseus, who\r\napprehended, perhaps, the tricks of his domestics, stowing away his\r\ncasks of choice old wine in the Thalamos, doubtless, considering it\r\nsafer there, under the keeping of Euryclea, than it would have been\r\nanywhere else in the palace.[325]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 324:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

Poll. vii. 397.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn later and more civilized ages, the Thalamos was still used for the\r\nsame purposes; for, in the establishment of Ischomachos, a pattern of\r\nAttic economy, we find that the more valuable portion of the family\r\nwardrobe, with the plate and other costly utensils, was there deposited.\r\nCorn, according to the suggestions of common sense, they laid up in the\r\ndriest rooms, wine in the coolest. The apartments into which most\r\nsunshine found its way were appropriated to such employments and to the\r\ndisplay of such furniture as required much light.[326] Their\r\ndining-rooms, where, also, the men usually sat when at home, they\r\ncarefully contrived so as to be cool in summer and warm in winter,\r\nthough, in severe weather, a good fire was often found necessary.[327]\r\nThe same judicious principle commonly regulated the erection of their\r\nhabitations, which were divided into two sets of apartments, suited to\r\nthe two great divisions of the year. As we have already remarked, the\r\nprincipal front looked towards the south, that it might catch the rays\r\nof the wintry sun, whose more vertical summer beams were excluded by\r\nbroad verandahs, or colonnades.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 326:\r\n\r\n  Xen. Memorab. iii. 8, 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 327:\r\n\r\n  Anaxand. ap. Athen. ii. 29.—So also thought Socrates, who observes,\r\n  that in winter every one will have a fire who can get wood. And,\r\n  though he himself wore the same garments all the year round, he\r\n  considered it, apparently, a judicious practice in others to put on\r\n  warm clothing.—Xen. Œcon. xvii. 3. Sch.

At first, doubtless, they were content with cold water; but that\r\nthis was soon succeeded by warm water[329] may be conjectured from the\r\ntradition ascribing the first use of it to Heracles, whence warm baths\r\nwere ever afterwards called the Baths of Heracles.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 328:\r\n\r\n  Etym.

In the baths of Pompeii the marble basins, whether\r\nparallelogramatic or circular, were of spacious dimensions, and raised\r\ntwo or three feet above the pavement. A step for the convenience of the\r\nbathers extends round it on the inside, and at the bottom are marble\r\ncushions upon which they rested. In the labra of the Grecian female\r\nbaths rose a smooth cippus in the form of a truncated cone, denominated\r\nomphalos, on which the ladies sat while chatting with their female\r\ncompanions.[332]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 330:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Aristoph. Nub. 1034.\r\n\r\nFootnote 334:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Alexand. § 40.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe public baths, of which no full description referring to very ancient\r\ntimes remains, were numerous in all Hellenic cities, more particularly\r\nat Athens, where they were surmounted with domes,[335] and received\r\ntheir light from above. These establishments were frequented by all\r\nclasses of women who could afford to pay for such luxury, rich, poor,\r\nhonourable, and dishonourable.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 335:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xi. 104.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe attendants, in later and more corrupt times at least, were men,\r\nwhose sole clothing consisted of a leathern apron about the loins, while\r\nthe ladies, who undressed in the Apodyterion, went through the various\r\nprocesses of the bath in the same primitive clothing. It was, however,\r\ncustomary for them to enter the water together in crowds,[336] so that\r\nthey kept each other in countenance. Here the matrons who had sons to\r\nmarry studied the form and character of the young ladies who frequented\r\nthe baths; and as all the defects both of person and features were\r\nnecessarily revealed, it was next to impossible for any lady, not\r\nsufficiently opulent to keep up a bathing establishment in her own\r\nhouse, to retain for any length of time an undeserved celebrity for\r\nbeauty. In the baths of the East, the bodies of the bathers are cleansed\r\nby small bags of camel-hair, woven rough, and passed over the hand of\r\nthe attendant; or with a handful of the fine fibres of the Mekka\r\npalm-tree combed soft, and filled with fragrant and saponaceous earths,\r\nwhich are rubbed on the skin till the whole body is covered with froth.\r\nSimilar means were employed in the baths of Greece, and the whole was\r\nafterwards cleansed off the skin by gold or silver stlengides, or blunt\r\nscrapers somewhat curved towards the point.[337]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 336:\r\n\r\n  Victor. ad Aristot.

The price was usually moderate, though in\r\nsome cities, as for example at Phaselis, they were in the habit of\r\ndoubling their charges to foreigners, which drew from a witty sophist a\r\nvery cutting remark; for his slave disputing with the keeper of the\r\nbath, and contending that his master ought not to be charged more than\r\nother persons, the sophist, who overheard the dispute, exclaimed,\r\n“Wretch, would you make me a ‘Phaselitan for a farthing?’”[342]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 341:\r\n\r\n  Aristot.

But there a parapet\r\nusually preserves him who enjoys the scene from falling. It was\r\notherwise of old in Greece. The roof consisted simply of a number of\r\nbeams laid close together and covered with cement, so that, as was\r\nproved by the fate of Elpenor,[345] the practice of sleeping there in\r\nwarm weather, quite common throughout the country, was not wholly\r\nwithout danger.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 343:\r\n\r\n  Æsch.

It is certain, however, contrary to\r\nthe common opinion, that it was furnished with a chimney,[347] and that\r\nthe smoke was not permitted to find its way through an aperture in the\r\nroof. Thus much might be inferred from a passage in the Wasps, when the\r\nold dicast, in love with the courts of law, is endeavouring to escape\r\nfrom the restraint imposed on him by his son, by climbing out through\r\nthe chimney. It is clear that he has got into some aperture, where he is\r\nhidden from sight, for hearing a noise in the wall, his son Bdelycleon,\r\ncries out, “What is that?” upon which the old man replies, “I am only\r\nthe smoke.” It is plain, that he would not, like a Hindù Yoghi, be\r\nbalancing himself in the air, otherwise the young man must have beheld\r\nhim sailing up towards the roof. But the matter is set entirely at rest\r\nby the Scholiast, who observes, that the καπνοδόχη was a narrow channel\r\nlike a pipe through which the smoke ascended from the kitchen. This\r\nexplanation has been confirmed by the discoveries of Colonel Leake,[348]\r\nwho on the rocky slopes of the hill of the Museion and Pnyx, found the\r\nremains of a house partly excavated in the rock, in which the chimney\r\nstill remained.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 346:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

However,\r\nthis may have arisen from the numerous small furnaces which, as in\r\nFrance, were ranged along the wall for the purpose of cooking several\r\ndishes at once. The chimneys having been perpendicular, as in our old\r\nfarm-houses, were furnished with stoppers to keep out the rain in bad\r\nweather.[350]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 349:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Vesp. 148.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThat the kitchens were sometimes not sufficiently airy and comfortable\r\nmay be inferred from the practice of a philosophical cook in Damoxenos,\r\nwho used to take his station immediately outside the door, and from\r\nthence give his orders to the inferior operatives. Great care was\r\nnevertheless taken that it should be well lighted, and that the door\r\nshould be so situated as to be as little exposed as possible to whirling\r\ngusts of wind.[351] From a passage in the Scholiast on the Wasps, and\r\nthe existence of drains in the excavations on the hill of the Museion,\r\nit is clear that the Athenian houses were furnished with sinks,[352]\r\nthough in the Italian kitchens there seem merely to have been little\r\nchannels running along the walls to carry off the water. The floor, too,\r\nwas constructed in both countries with a view at once to dryness and\r\nelegance,[353] being formed of several layers of various materials all\r\nporous though binding, so that it allowed whatever water was spilt to\r\nsink through instantaneously. The upper layer, about six inches thick,\r\nconsisted of a cement composed of lime, sand, and pounded charcoal or\r\nashes, the surface of which, being polished with pumice-stone, presented\r\nto the eye the appearance of a fine black marble. The roof in early\r\ntimes was no doubt of wood,[354] though afterwards it came to be vaulted\r\nor run up in the form of a cupola. The walls were sometimes decorated\r\nwith rude paintings.[355]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 351:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 60 ix. 22.\r\n\r\nFootnote 352:\r\n\r\n  Leake, Topog. of Ath. p. 361.

The doors were fastened at first by long bars passing into\r\nthe wall on both sides;[361] and by degrees smaller bolts, hasps,\r\nlatches, and locks and keys succeeded. For example the outer door of the\r\nThalamos in Homer was secured by a silver hasp, and a leathern thong\r\npassed round the handle and tied, perhaps, in a curious knot.[362] Doors\r\nwere not usually suspended on hinges, but turned, as they still do in\r\nthe East, upon pivots inserted above into the lintel and below into the\r\nthreshhold.[363] In many houses there were in addition small half-doors\r\nof open wood-work,[364] which alone were commonly closed by day, in\r\norder to keep the children from running out, or dogs or pigs from\r\nentering. The doors usually consisted of a frame-work, with four or six\r\nsunken panels, as with us; but at Sparta, so long as the laws of\r\nLycurgus prevailed, they were made of simple planks fashioned with the\r\nhatchet.[365] In the great Dorian capital the custom was for persons\r\ndesirous of entering a house to shout aloud at the door,[366] which, at\r\nAthens,[367] was always furnished with an elegant knocker.[368]\r\nDoor-handles, too, of costly materials and curious workmanship,[369]\r\nbespoke even in that trifling matter the taste of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 360:\r\n\r\n  Sagitt. de Jan.

In the manufacture of the latter[370] the ancients exhibited\r\nmore skill and care than we; they had bricks of a very large size, and\r\nhalf bricks for filling up spaces, which prevented the necessity of\r\nshortening them with the trowel. Of these some were simply dried in the\r\nsun, used chiefly in building the dwellings of the poor.[371] At Utica\r\nin Africa there were public inspectors of brick-kilns,[372] to prevent\r\nany from being used which had not been made five years. In several\r\ncities on the Mediterranean bricks were manufactured of a porous earth,\r\nwhich when baked and painted, as it may be conjectured, on the outside,\r\nwere so light that they would swim in water.[373] To diminish the weight\r\nof bricks, straw was introduced into them in Syria and Egypt, which was\r\naltogether consumed in the baking. In roofing such of their houses as\r\nwere not terraced they employed slates, tiles, and reed-thatch.[374]\r\nPossibly, also, the wealthy may have tiled their houses with those\r\nelegant thin flakes of marble, with which the roofs of temples were\r\noccasionally covered.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 370:\r\n\r\n  Winkelm.

First, as a mark of the national piety,\r\neverything used in domestic sacrifices was set apart. The second\r\ndivision, placing women immediately after the gods, comprehended the\r\nwhole apparatus of female ornaments[375] worn on solemn festivals. Next\r\nwere classed the sacred robes and military uniforms of the men; then\r\ncame the hangings, bed-furniture, and ornaments of the harem; afterwards\r\nthose of the men’s apartments. Another division consisted of the shoes,\r\nsandals, slippers, &c., of the family, from which we pass to the arms\r\nand implements of war, mixed up familiarly in a Greek house with looms,\r\ncards, spinning-wheels, and embroidery-frames, just, as Homer describes\r\nthem in the Thalamos of Paris at Troy. Even yet we have not reached the\r\nend of our inventory in mere classification. The baking, cooking,\r\nwashing, and bathing vessels formed a separate class, and so did the\r\nbreakfast and dinner services, the porcelain, the plate of silver and\r\ngold, the mirrors, the candelabra, and all those curious articles made\r\nuse of in the toilette of the ladies.[376]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 375:\r\n\r\n  This profusion of wearing apparel was laid up in trunks and\r\n  _mallekins_ of wickerwork.

The\r\nmovables of all kinds having been thus arranged in their classes, the\r\nnext step was to deposit every thing in its proper place.[377] The more\r\nordinary utensils were generally laid up in a spacious store-room,\r\ncalled _tholos_,[378] a circular building detached from the house, and\r\nusually terminating in a pointed roof, whence in after ages a\r\nsharp-crowned hat obtained among the people the name of Tholos. When a\r\ngentleman first commenced housekeeping, or got a new set of domestics,\r\nhe delivered into the care of the proper individuals his kneading\r\ntroughs, his kitchen utensils, his cards, looms, spinning wheels, and so\r\non; and, pointing out the places where all these, when not in use,\r\nshould be placed, committed them to their custody.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 377:\r\n\r\n  Cicero ap.

These, being\r\nbrought forward only on solemn festivals, or in honour of some foreign\r\nguest, were entrusted to the immediate care of the housekeeper, a\r\ncomplete list of everything having first been taken; and it was part of\r\nher duty, when she delivered any of these articles to the inferior\r\ndomestics, to make a note of what she gave out, and take care they were\r\nduly returned into her keeping.[379]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 379:\r\n\r\n  Xen. Œconom. ix. 10. 57.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut the above comprehensive glance over the articles of furniture made\r\nuse of in an Athenian gentleman’s establishment, though it may give some\r\nnotion of the careful and economical habits of the people, affords no\r\nconception of the splendour and magnificence often found in a Grecian\r\nhouse: for, as we have already seen, their opinions are highly erroneous\r\nwho imagine that in the Attic democracy the rich were by any prudential\r\nor political considerations restrained from indulging their love of\r\nostentation by the utmost display they could make of wealth.[380] In\r\nfact, not content with outstripping their neighbours in the grandeur of\r\ntheir dwellings, furniture, and dress, these persons had often the\r\nludicrous vanity, when they gave a large party, to excite the envy of\r\nsuch dinnerless rogues as might pass, by throwing out the feathers of\r\ngame and poultry before their doors.[381] Indeed, since the Athenians\r\nexactly resembled other men, the exhibition of magnificence tended but\r\ntoo strongly to dazzle them; so that, among the arts of designing\r\npoliticians, one generally was, to create a popular persuasion that they\r\npossessed the means of conferring important favours on all who obliged\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFootnote 380:\r\n\r\n  That the sycophants were sometimes troublesome, however, is certain;\r\n  that is to say, in later ages. Speaking of the time of his youth,\r\n  Isocrates says:—Οὐδεὶς οὔτ᾽ ἀπεκρύπτετο τὴν οὐσίαν οὔτ᾽ ὤκνει\r\n  συμβάλλειν. κ. τ. λ.—Areop. § 12. Cf. Bergmann. in loc. p. 362. But\r\n  their persecution must always have been confined to a very few\r\n  individuals, as people generally continued to display whatever they\r\n  possessed down to the final overthrow of the state.\r\n\r\nFootnote 381:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph. Acharn. 398.—_Mitchell._ The learned editor fails to remark\r\n  how little this custom harmonizes with the fears which he imagines\r\n  rich people felt at Athens.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo proceed, however, with the furniture. Though the principal value of\r\nmany articles arose from the exquisite taste displayed in the design and\r\nworkmanship, the materials themselves, too, were often extremely rare\r\nand costly. Porcelain, glass, crystal, ivory, amber,[382] gold, silver,\r\nand bronze, with numerous varieties of precious woods, were wrought up\r\nwith inimitable taste and fancy into various articles of use or luxury.\r\nAmong the decorations of the dining-room was the side-board, which,\r\nthough sometimes of iron, was more frequently of carved wood, bronze, or\r\nwrought silver, ornamented with the heads of satyrs and oxen.[383] Their\r\ntables, in the Homeric age, were generally of wood, of variegated\r\ncolours, finely polished, and with ornamented feet. Myrleanos, an\r\nobscure writer in Athenæus, imagines[384] they were round, that they\r\nmight resemble the disc of the sun and moon; but from the passage in the\r\nOdyssey,[385] and the interpretation of Eustathius, they may be inferred\r\nto have been narrow parallelograms,[386] like our own dining-tables. The\r\nluxury of table-cloths being unknown, the wine spilled, &c., was\r\ncleansed away with sponges.[387] But the poet had witnessed a superior\r\ndegree of magnificence, for he already, in the Odyssey,[388] makes\r\nmention of tables of silver. The poor were, of course, content with the\r\ncommonest wood. But as civilisation proceeded, the tables of the wealthy\r\nbecame more and more costly in materials, and more elegant in form.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 382:\r\n\r\n  On the attractive power of this substance, see Plat.

Athen. ix. 75.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt grew to be an object of commerce, to import from foreign countries\r\nthe most curious kinds of wood,[389] to be wrought into tables, which\r\noriginally supported on four legs, rested afterwards on three,\r\nfancifully formed, or on a pillar and claws of ivory, or silver, as with\r\nus. There was a celebrated species of table manufactured in the island\r\nof Rhenea;[390] the great, among the Persians, delighted in maple tables\r\nwith ivory feet, and, in fact, the knotted maple appears at one time to\r\nhave been regarded as the most rare and beautiful of woods.[391] But the\r\nrage for sumptuous articles of furniture of this kind did not reach its\r\nfull height until Roman times, when a single table of citron wood\r\n\r\n                                (Gorgeous feasts\r\n                On citron tables or Atlantic stone)[392]\r\n\r\nsometimes cost six or seven thousand pounds sterling. Already, however,\r\nin the best ages of Greece, their tables were inlaid with silver, brass,\r\nor ivory, with feet in the form of lions, leopards, or other wild\r\nbeasts.[393]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 389:\r\n\r\n  Plin.

The thrones of the gods represented in works of art,\r\nhowever richly ornamented, are simply arm-chairs with upright backs, an\r\nexample of which occurs in a carnelian in the Orleans Collection,[395]\r\nwhere Apollo is represented playing on the seven-stringed lyre. This\r\nchair has four legs with tigers’ feet, a very high upright back, and is\r\nornamented with a sculptured car and horses. They had no Epicurean\r\nnotions of their deities, and never presented them to the eye of the\r\npublic lounging in an easy chair, which would have suggested the idea of\r\ninfirmity. On the contrary, they are full of force and energy, and sit\r\nerect on their thrones, as ready to succour their worshipers at a\r\nmoment’s warning. In the Homeric age these were richly carved, like the\r\ndivans, adorned with silver studs, and so high that they required a\r\nfootstool.[396] The throne of the Persian kings was of massive gold, and\r\nstood beneath a purple canopy, supported by four slender golden columns\r\nthickly crusted with jewels.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 394:\r\n\r\n  In the Antichita di Ercolano, we have the representation of a very\r\n  handsome armed chair, with upright back, beautifully turned legs, and\r\n  thick and soft cushions, with low footstool, t. i. tav. 29. p. 155.\r\n  Athen. xi. 72.\r\n\r\nFootnote 395:\r\n\r\n  Pierres Gravées, du Cabinet du Duc d’Orleans, t. i.

Il. σ. 390, 422.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBedsteads were generally of common wood such as deal,[397] bottomed\r\nsometimes with planks, pierced to admit air, sometimes with ox-hide\r\nthongs,[398] which in traversing each other left numerous open spaces\r\nbetween them. Odysseus’s bedstead, which the hero was sufficient joiner\r\nto manufacture with his own hands, was made of olive-wood, inlaid with\r\nsilver, gold, and ivory. Sometimes the bed was supported by a sort of\r\nnetting of strong cord, stretched across the bedstead, and made fast all\r\nround.[399] Later ages witnessed far greater luxury,—bedsteads of solid\r\nsilver,[400] or ivory embossed with figures wrought with infinite art\r\nand delicacy,[401] or of precious woods carved, with feet of ivory or\r\namber.[402] Occasionally, also, they were veneered with Indian\r\ntortoiseshell, inlaid with gold.[403] This taste would appear to have\r\nflowed from the East, where among the kings of Persia still greater\r\nmagnificence was witnessed even in very early times. Thus, speaking of\r\nthe royal feast celebrated at Susa, the Scripture says, there were in\r\nthe court of the garden of the king’s palace “white, green, and blue\r\nhangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings,\r\nand pillars of marble. The beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement\r\nof red, and blue, and white, and black marble.” A similar style of\r\ngrandeur is attributed by Hellenic writers to the Persian king, who,\r\naccording to Chares,[404] reclined in his palace on a couch shaded by a\r\nspreading golden vine, the grape clusters of which were imitated by\r\njewels of various colours.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 397:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xi. 48. i. 60. ii. 29.

Sac. i. 6. 30.\r\n\r\nFootnote 404:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xii. 9, 55.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFour-post bedsteads were in use in remoter ages, as appears from a white\r\nsardonyx in the Orleans Collection,[405] representing the surprisal of\r\nAres and Aphrodite, by Hephæstos. There is a low floating vallance\r\nfastened up in festoons, the tester is roof-shaped, and the pillars\r\nterminate in fanciful capitals. The figure of an eagle adorns the\r\ncorners of the bedstead below. From a painting on the walls of Pompeii\r\nwe discover, that the peculiar sort of bedstead at present found almost\r\nuniversally in France was likewise familiar to the ancients, made\r\nexactly after the same fashion, and raised about the same height above\r\nthe floor. With regard to the beds themselves they were at different\r\ntimes manufactured from very different materials, and those of some\r\nparts of Greece enjoyed a peculiar reputation. From a phrase in\r\nHomer,[406] it would appear that, in his times, beds were stuffed in\r\nThessaly with very fine grass. Those of Chios and Miletos were\r\nfamous[407] throughout Greece. In other parts of the country, persons of\r\npeculiar effeminacy slept on beds of sponge.[408] Sicily was famous for\r\nits pillows, as were also several other Doric countries. At Athens the\r\nrich were accustomed to sleep upon very soft beds, placed on bedsteads\r\nconsiderably above the floor;[409] and sometimes, it has been supposed,\r\nadorned with coverlets of dressed peacocks’ skins with the feathers\r\non.[410]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 405:\r\n\r\n  No. 34.\r\n\r\nFootnote 406:\r\n\r\n  Il. β. 697. δ. 383.\r\n\r\nFootnote 407:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xi. 72.\r\n\r\nFootnote 408:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 32.\r\n\r\nFootnote 409:\r\n\r\n  Xen.

We find mention in ancient\r\n  authors of certain tribes who went clad in garments covered with the\r\n  feathers of birds. Senec. Epist. 90.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut the Greeks appear to have consulted their ease, and sunk more\r\ncompletely into softness and effeminacy, in proportion as they\r\napproached the East. Among the Peloponnesians most persons lived hard\r\nand lay hard; greater refinement and luxury prevailed in Attica; but in\r\nIonia and many of the Ægæan isles the great—although there were\r\nexceptions as in the case of Attalos—fell little short in\r\nself-indulgence of Median or Persian satraps. Some idea may be formed of\r\ntheir habits in this respect from the description of a Paphian prince’s\r\nbed by Clearchos of Soli.[411] Over the soft mattresses supported by a\r\nsilver-footed bedstead, was flung a short grained Sardian carpet of the\r\nmost expensive kind. A coverlet of downy texture succeeded, and upon\r\nthis was cast a costly counterpane of Amorginian purple. Cushions,\r\nstriped or variegated with the richest purple, supported his head, while\r\ntwo soft Dorian pillows[412] of pale pink gently raised his feet. In\r\nthis manner habited in a milk-white chlamys the prince reclined. Their\r\nbolsters in form resembled our own;[413] but the pillows were usually\r\nsquare, as in France, though occasionally rounded off at both ends, and\r\ncovered with richly chequered or variegated muslins. To prevent the fine\r\nwool or whatever else they were stuffed with from getting into heaps,\r\nmattresses were sewn through as now, and carefully tufted that the\r\npackthread might not break through the ticking.[414]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 411:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 37.\r\n\r\nFootnote 412:\r\n\r\n  Athen. ii. 29, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 413:\r\n\r\n  Gitone, Nozze di Ulisse è Penelope, Il Costume, &c. tav. 67.\r\n\r\nFootnote 414:\r\n\r\n  See the mattress on which the statue of Hermaphroditos reclines in the\r\n  Louvre.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAmong the Orientals it is common at present for persons to sleep in\r\ntheir day apparel; but even in the heroic ages it was already customary\r\nin Greece to undress on going to bed. When Agamemnon is roused before\r\ndawn by the delusive dream, the whole process of the morning toilette is\r\ndescribed. First, says the poet, he donned his soft chiton which was new\r\nand very handsome; next his pelisse; after which he bound on his elegant\r\nsandals and suspended his silver-hilted sword from his shoulder. Thus\r\naccoutred he issued forth, sceptre in hand, towards the ships.[415]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 415:\r\n\r\n  Il. β. 42, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn Syria, children luxuriously educated are said to have been rocked in\r\ntheir cradles wrapped in coverlets of Milesian wool.[416] The sheep of\r\nMiletos were, in fact, the Merinos of antiquity; and their wool being\r\ncelebrated for its fineness and softness, it was not only employed in\r\nmanufacturing the best cloths, but also in stuffing the mattresses of\r\nkings and other great personages who thought much of their ease. And as\r\nthe vulgar imagine they become great by habiting themselves in garments\r\nsimilar to those of their princes, like the honest man who sought wisdom\r\nthrough reading by Epictetus’ lamp, the stuffs, couches, and coverlets\r\nof Miletos got into great vogue among the ancients. Virgil, Cicero,\r\nServius, Columella, and many other writers speak accordingly of their\r\nexcellence, and their testimonies have, with wonderful industry, been\r\ncollected by the learned Bochart.[417]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 416:\r\n\r\n  Esther i. 6.

No one appears to have paid a single visit to\r\nPersia, or Syria, or Egypt, without bringing back along with him some\r\npestilent new freak in the matter of dress or furniture, wholly at\r\nvariance with republican simplicity. We might adduce numerous anecdotes\r\nin proof of this. For the present we confine ourselves to the following.\r\nAmong the Persians, renowned in all ages for sensual indulgences, it was\r\njudged of so much importance to enjoy soft and elegantly arranged beds,\r\nthat in great houses persons were employed who attended only to this. An\r\nanecdote in illustration has been preserved by Athenæus. Timagoras, or,\r\naccording to Phanias, Entimos of Gortyna, envying Themistocles his\r\nreception at the court of Persia, undertook himself a toad-eating\r\nexpedition to that country. Artaxerxes, whose ear could tolerate more\r\nflatterers than one, took the Cretan into favour, and made him a present\r\nof a superb marquee, a silver-footed bedstead, with costly furniture,\r\nand, along with them, sent a slave, as a Turkish pasha would send a cook\r\nor a pipe-lighter, because, in his opinion, the Greeks who prepared\r\nsleeping-places for so many Persians at Marathon and Platæa, understood\r\nnothing of bed-making.\r\n\r\nEntimos evidently excelled the great Athenian in the arts of a courtier.\r\nIn fact, he was the very prototype of Hajji Baba, and enjoyed even still\r\ngreater influence over the Shah than the illustrious barber’s son of\r\nIspahan. Charmed by his cajolery, Artaxerxes invited him to his private\r\ntable, where, usually, none but princes of the blood were admitted,[424]\r\nan honour, as Phanias assures us, which no other Greek ever enjoyed.\r\nFor, though Timagoras of Athens performed _kou-tou_ before the\r\nthrone,[425] whereby he obtained great consideration among a nation of\r\nslaves, and was hanged when he got home, he was not invited to\r\nhob-and-nob with his majesty, but only enjoyed the distinction of having\r\ncertain dishes sent him from the king’s table. To Antalcidas, the\r\nSpartan, Artaxerxes sent his crown dipped in liquid perfume, an\r\nagreeable compliment, but which he more than once paid to Entimos, whose\r\nextraordinary favour at court in the long run, however, awakened the\r\nenvy of the Persians. The canopy of the marquee presented to this Cretan\r\nwas spangled with bright flowers, and, among the other articles of which\r\nthe imperial gift consisted, were a throne of massive silver, a gilded\r\nparasol, several golden cups crusted with jewels, a hundred maple-tables\r\nwith ivory feet, a hundred goblets of silver, several vases of the same\r\nprecious metal, a hundred female slaves, an equal number of youths, with\r\nsix thousand pieces of gold, besides what was furnished him for his\r\ndaily expenditure.[426]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 424:\r\n\r\n  Very nearly the same customs prevail in Persia at the present day,\r\n  except that the rules of etiquette seem to be still more rigidly\r\n  observed. “It is a general custom with the kings of Persia to eat in\r\n  solitary grandeur. The late Shah, however, would sometimes have select\r\n  portions of his family to breakfast with him.” On which occasion,\r\n  “they used to squat round him in the form of a crescent, of which he\r\n  was the centre, and were all placed scrupulously according to\r\n  rank.”—Fowler, i. 48.\r\n\r\nFootnote 425:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 58.

The Greeks were almost\r\nequally ingenious. With them what was a cloak by day became sometimes a\r\ncounterpane at night,[427] in addition, perhaps, to the ordinary\r\nbed-clothes; for it is clear they loved to be warm, from the somewhat\r\nreproachful allusion of Strepsiades in the “Clouds” to the five\r\n_sisyræ_,[428] rolled snugly up in which, his son, Pheidippides, could\r\nsleep while thoughts of his debts bit the old man like so many bugs, and\r\nroused him hours before day to consult his ledgers. All kinds of\r\nstromata were, in Plato’s time, divided into two classes, first,\r\ncoverings for the body, such as cloaks, mantles, and so on; secondly,\r\nbed-clothes, properly so called.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 427:\r\n\r\n  Xen.

Among the\r\nMacedonians, after their Eastern conquests, gold plate appears not to\r\nhave been uncommon; for at the grand supper described by Hippolochos in\r\nhis letter to Lynceus, every guest is said to have used it.[437] The\r\npredilection for this sort of magnificence they acquired in Asia, where,\r\nat a banquet given to Alexander, the whole dessert was brought in\r\ntastefully covered with gold-leaf.[438] In the reign of his father,\r\nPhilip, the precious metals were rare in Macedonia. Indeed, that crafty\r\nold monarch, possessing but one gold cup in the world, had so good an\r\nopinion of his courtiers that, to prevent their thieving it, he slept\r\nevery night with it under his pillow.[439] Gold was, more early,\r\nplentiful in Attica. Alcibiades, with tastes and habits unsuited to a\r\ndemocracy, carried so far his love of display as to make use of\r\nthuribles, or censers, and wash-hand basins of pure gold.[440] But the\r\nostentatious son of Clinias, though extravagant, was in this respect\r\nonly a type of his nation. Every rich citizen of Athens aimed at the\r\nsame degree of splendour; and, in describing his town-house or favourite\r\nvilla, might, with little alteration, have adopted the language of the\r\npoet:—\r\n\r\n                   ——“My house within the city\r\n             Is richly furnished with plate and gold,\r\n             Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands:\r\n             My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry.\r\n             In ivory coffers have I stuffed my crowns;\r\n             In cypress chests my arras, counterpanes,\r\n             Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,\r\n             Fine linen, Turkey cushions bossed with pearl,\r\n             Vallance of Venice, gold in needle-work,\r\n             Pewter and brass, and all things that belong\r\n             To house or housekeeping.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 437:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iv. 2, sqq.

The form and\r\nworkmanship of these materials varied, no doubt, according to the taste\r\nand means of the possessor; but they were in general distinguished for\r\nthe elegance of their outline, the grace and originality of the\r\nsculpture, the fineness, delicacy, and minute finish of the execution.\r\nIt is well known, as an able antiquarian[443] has remarked, to what an\r\nexcess the luxury of the table was carried among the ancients, and how\r\nmuch they surpassed us in the dimensions, the massiveness, the\r\nworkmanship, the quality, and the variety of their drinking apparatus.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 442:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xi. 3.

Helen,[445] it is said, justly proud of\r\nher beautiful bosom, dedicated in one of the temples of Rhodes, as a\r\nvotive offering, an amber goblet, exactly of the size and shape of one\r\nof her breasts, which, had it come down to posterity, might have\r\nfurnished artists with a perfect model of that part of the female form.\r\nHowever this may be, the ancients, in remote ages, set a great value on\r\ntheir cups, particularly such as were considered heir-looms in the\r\nfamily, and laid apart to be used only on extraordinary occasions. Hence\r\nŒdipos, in the old Cyclic poet, is seized with fierce anger at his son,\r\nwho had, contrary to his will, brought forth his old hereditary goblets\r\nto be used at an ordinary entertainment.\r\n\r\n           Then Polyneices of the golden locks,\r\n           Sprung from the Gods, before his father placed\r\n           A table all of silver, which had once\r\n           Been Cadmus’s, next filled the golden bowl\r\n           With richest wine. At this old Œdipos,\r\n           Seeing the honoured relics of his sire\r\n           Profaned to vulgar uses, roused to anger,\r\n           Pronounced fierce imprecations, wished his sons\r\n           Might live no more in amity together,\r\n           But plunge in feuds and slaughters, and contend\r\n           For their inheritance: and the Furies heard.[446]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 445:\r\n\r\n  Bruyerin, De Re Cibaria, l. iii. c. 9.

Several\r\n  votive offerings, representing the female breast, may be seen in the\r\n  British Museum, among the Elgin Marbles. But the most curious relic of\r\n  the ancient female form is mentioned in the following passage: “In the\r\n  street just out of the gate of this villa I lately saw a skeleton dug\r\n  out; and by desiring the labourers to remove the skull and bones\r\n  gently, I perceived distinctly the perfect mould of every feature of\r\n  the face, and that the eyes had been shut. I also saw distinctly the\r\n  impression of the large folds of the drapery of the toga, and some of\r\n  the cloth itself sticking to the earth. The city was first covered by\r\n  a shower of hot pumice-stones and ashes, and then by a shower of small\r\n  ashes mixed with water. It was in the latter stratum that the skeleton\r\n  above described was found. In the Museum at Portici a piece of this\r\n  sort of hardened mud is preserved; it is stamped with the impression\r\n  of the breast of a woman, with a thin drapery over it. The skeleton I\r\n  saw dug out was not above five feet from the surface. It is very\r\n  extraordinary that the impression of the body and face should have\r\n  remained from the year 79 to this day, especially as I found the earth\r\n  so little hardened that it separated upon the least touch.”—Sir W.\r\n  Hamilton, Acc. of Discov. at Pompeii, p. 15.\r\n\r\nFootnote 446:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xi. 14.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAgathocles, tyrant of Sicily, appears to have been an amateur of cups,\r\nand would sometimes while exhibiting his collection to his friends make\r\na good-humoured allusion to his original occupation. “These golden\r\nvessels,” said he, “have been made out of those earthenware ones which I\r\nformerly manufactured.”[447] Drinking-bowls in fact made no\r\ninconsiderable figure in ancient times. They were bestowed as the prizes\r\nin gymnastic contests, and in Greece men boxed and wrestled for the cup\r\nas horses run for it in England. Parasites, like the jester of Louis\r\nXIV., used sometimes to carry home the cups and dishes set before them\r\nat dinner; but the tables were often turned when the subject gave and\r\nthe prince pocketed the dole.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 447:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xi. 15. Polyb. xii. 15. 6. xv. 35. 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA curious legend has been preserved to us connected with the subject of\r\ncups. Several princes uniting, in remote times, to send a colony to\r\nLesbos, were commanded by an oracle to cast a virgin, during their\r\nvoyage, into the sea, as a sacrifice to Poseidon. Obedience, in those\r\nsuperstitious ages, was seldom refused to such injunctions. The maiden\r\nwas precipitated into the waves, but Enallos, one of the chiefs, in whom\r\nlove had quenched the reverence for oracles, immediately plunged in to\r\nsave her. Neither the chief, however, nor the virgin appeared again, and\r\nthe fleet proceeded. The remainder of the tradition may be illustrated\r\nby an event said to have taken place in the Tonga islands.[448] They\r\nwere probably near some uninhabited isle, and instead of rising to the\r\nsurface of the sea, emerged into a cavern elevated considerably above\r\nits level, and opening perhaps upon the land. “God tempers the wind to\r\nthe shorn lamb,” says a modern writer, and so Enallos found it. By means\r\nunrevealed in the ancient narrative, the hero and his bride continued to\r\nsubsist on the rock, and many years afterwards, when the colony was\r\nalready flourishing, he one day presented himself before his old friends\r\nat Methymna, and entertained them with a very romantic account of his\r\nresidence among the Nereids at the bottom of the sea, where he was\r\nhonoured with the care of Poseidon’s horses when sent out to grass. At\r\nlength, however, getting on the back of a large wave it bore him upwards\r\nand he escaped from the deep, bearing in his hand a golden cup, the\r\nmetal of which was so marvellously beautiful that in comparison ordinary\r\ngold appeared no better than brass.[449]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 448:\r\n\r\n  See ariner’s Account, chap. 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 449:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xi. 15.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEven the loftiest and least worldly-minded of the Homeric heroes,\r\nAchilles, set great value on a favourite drinking-cup, which he\r\npreserved for his own particular use, and for pouring out libations to\r\nZeus alone. Priam[450] was careful to include a rare goblet in the\r\nransom of Hector’s body, and a similar gift aided in alluring Alcmena\r\nfrom the paths of virtue.[451] But the most famous bowl of antiquity was\r\nthat of Heracles, which, more capacious than the barber’s basin in Don\r\nQuixote, served its illustrious owner in the double capacity of a\r\ndrinking-cup and a canoe; for when he had quenched his thirst, he could\r\nset his bowl afloat, and, leaping into it, steer to any part of the\r\nworld he pleased. Some, indeed, speak of it as a borrowed article,\r\nbelonging originally to the Sun, and in which the god used nightly to\r\ntraverse the ocean from West to East.[452]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 450:\r\n\r\n  Iliad. ω. 234.\r\n\r\nFootnote 451:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xi. 16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 452:\r\n\r\n  Bentley, Dissert. on Phal. i. 175, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo pass, however, over the goblets of mythology. It was fashionable to\r\npossess plate of this kind finely sculptured with historical arguments;\r\nand history has preserved the names of Cimon and Athenocles, two artists\r\nwho excelled in this style of engraving. These cups were sometimes of\r\nsilver gilt, sometimes of massive gold crusted with jewels.[453] In\r\naddition to the two artists named above, we may enumerate Crates,\r\nStratonicos, Myrmecides of Miletos, Callicrates the Lacedemonian, and\r\nMys, whose “Cup of Heracles,” celebrated in antiquity, had represented\r\nupon it the storming of Ilion, with this inscription,\r\n\r\n           Troy’s lofty towers by Grecians sacked behold!\r\n           Parrhasios’ draught, by Mys engraved in gold.[454]\r\n\r\nThe names by which the ancients distinguished their several kinds of\r\ngoblets are too numerous to be here given. Some were curious—“Amalthea’s\r\nHorn,” “The Year,” &c. Rustics made use of two-handled wooden bowls in\r\nwhich, when thirsty, they drew fresh milk from the cow in the\r\nfields.[455] There was a big-bellied cup with a narrow neck which being\r\nshaped like a purse, participated with this very necessary article in\r\nthe name of Aryballos.[456]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 453:\r\n\r\n  Plin. xxxiii. 2.

Among these was the _Baucalis_, mentioned by Sopater the\r\nparodist, who says:—\r\n\r\n            ’Tis sweet in early morn to cool the lips\r\n            With pure fresh water from the gushing fount,\r\n            Mingled with honey in the Baucalis,\r\n            When one o’er night has made too free with wine,\r\n            And feels sharp thirst.[457]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 457:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xi. 28.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe glass-workers of Alexandria procured earthenware vessels from all\r\nparts of the world, which they used as models for their cups. Even the\r\ngreat sculptor Lysippos did not disdain to employ his genius in the\r\ninvention of a new kind of vase. Having made a collection of vessels of\r\nmany various shapes, and diligently studied the whole, he hit upon a\r\nform entirely new, and presented the model to Cassander, who having just\r\nthen founded the city of Cassandria, was ambitious of originating an\r\ninvention of this kind. He was desirous, perhaps, of recommending by the\r\nelegance of his drinking-cups the Mendæan wine exported in great\r\nquantities from his city.[458]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 458:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xi. 28.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere was a peculiar kind of cup called Grammateion, from the letters of\r\ngold chased upon its exterior.[459] Alexis mentions one of this sort in\r\nthe following lines:\r\n\r\n       A. But let me first describe the cup; ’twas round,\r\n          Old, broken-eared, and precious small besides,\r\n          Having indeed some letters on’t.\r\n\r\n       B.                               Yes letters;\r\n          Eleven, and all of gold, forming the name\r\n          Of Saviour Zeus.\r\n\r\n       A.                          Tush! no, some other god.[460]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 459:\r\n\r\n  We find in Winkelmann, Hist. de l’Art t. i. p. 23, the representation\r\n  of a glass grammateion, on which are the words: Bibe Vivas Multis\r\n  Annis. See a detailed description of this vase by the Marquis\r\n  Trivulsi, p. 46.\r\n\r\nFootnote 460:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xi. 30.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA very handsome sort of cup was imported from Sidon. It had two handles,\r\nand was ornamented with small figures in relief. Drinking-vases were\r\nalso formed from the large horns of the Molossian and Pœonian oxen; and\r\nthese articles were commonly rimmed with silver or gold.[461] Small cups\r\nwere made little account of. There was even one kind of bowl which, for\r\nits enormous capacity, was called the Elephant.\r\n\r\n             A. If this hold not enough, see the boy comes\r\n                Bearing the Elephant!\r\n\r\n             B.

This ware was black, highly varnished, with gilt\r\nedges;[464] but the name came afterwards to be applied to any vessel of\r\nthe same form from whatever materials manufactured. There were\r\naccordingly Thericlea of gold with wooden stands. The cups of this kind,\r\nmade at Athens, being very expensive, an inferior sort, in imitation,\r\nwas produced at Rhodes, which, as far more economical, had a great run\r\namong the humbler classes. The Thericlean was a species of deep chalice\r\nwith two handles, and bulging but little at the sides. Theophrastus[465]\r\nspeaks of Thericlea turned from the Syrian Turpentine tree, the wood of\r\nwhich being black and taking a fine polish, it was impossible at a\r\nglance to distinguish them from those of earthenware. The paintings on\r\nthese utensils appear to have been various. Sometimes a single wreath of\r\nivy encircled them immediately beneath the golden rim; but it seems\r\noccasionally to have been covered with representations of animals, which\r\ngave rise to a forced and false etymology of the name.[466]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 463:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

In fact, it seems, in very remote ages, to have\r\nbeen customary to convert bulls’ horns into cups with very little\r\npreparation; and the practice of quaffing wine from this rude kind of\r\ngoblet had by some been supposed to have suggested the idea to artists\r\nof representing Bacchos with horns, and to poets the epithet of the Bull\r\nDionysos. He was moreover worshiped at Cyzicos under the form of a bull.\r\nAfterwards, as taste and luxury advanced, these simple vessels were\r\nexchanged for horns of silver, which Pindar attributes to the\r\nCentaurs.[468] Xenophon[469] found drinking-horns among the\r\nPaphlagonians, and afterwards even in the palace of the Thracian king\r\nSeuthes. Æschylus speaks of silver horns, with lids of gold, in use\r\namong the Perrhæbians, and Sophocles, in his Pandora, makes mention of\r\ndrinking-horns of massive gold. Philip of Macedon was accustomed among\r\nhis friends to drink from the common horn. Golden horns were found among\r\nthe inhabitants of Cythera. Horns of silver were in use at Athens; and,\r\namong the articles enumerated as sold at a public auction, mention is\r\nmade of one of these vessels of a twisted form.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 467:\r\n\r\n  Bœckh.

Another kind was fashioned from a species of carbuncle found near\r\nthe city of Orchomenos,[472] in Arcadia. Glass mirrors[473] also came\r\nearly into use, chiefly manufactured, at the outset, by the Phœnicians\r\nof Sidon. The hand-mirrors were usually circular,[474] and set in costly\r\nframes. To prevent their being speedily tarnished they were, when not in\r\nuse, carefully enclosed in cases.[475]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 472:\r\n\r\n  Theoph. de Lapid. §. 33.\r\n\r\nFootnote 473:\r\n\r\n  It is to be observed, that before the application of quicksilver in\r\n  the construction of these glasses (which I presume is of no great\r\n  antiquity) the reflection of images by such specula must have been\r\n  effected by their being besmeared behind, or tinged through with some\r\n  dark colour, especially black, which would obstruct the refraction of\r\n  the rays of light.

For example, looking in one of these, a handsome woman\r\nwould find her visage transformed into that of a Gorgon, so as to appear\r\nterrible even to herself. Others again were so very flattering, that a\r\nhalf-starved barber, viewing his figure therein, appeared to be gifted\r\nwith the thewes of a Heracles. Another sort distorted the countenance,\r\nor inverted it, or showed merely the half.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 476:\r\n\r\n  Plaut. in Mostell. i. 3. 101.\r\n\r\nFootnote 477:\r\n\r\n  Plin. xxxiii. 45.

The first step was made towards these when\r\nthe Greek set up the images of his household gods upon his hearth.\r\nThence, step by step, he proceeded, improving the appearance, enriching\r\nthe materials, increasing the number of his domestic deities, with which\r\nniche after niche was filled, till his private dwelling became in some\r\nsort a temple. The religious feeling, no doubt, made way, in many cases,\r\nfor a passion for show, or a nascent taste for the beautiful; so that\r\nrude figures in terra-cotta, wood, or stone, were gradually replaced by\r\nexquisite statues in ivory, gold, or silver,[481] or the fairest marble,\r\nbreathing beauty and life, with eyes of gems, and clothed with majesty\r\nas with a garment. Hence flowed the passion for mimetic representations\r\nand all the plastic arts. The gods were transferred from the fireside to\r\nthe temple, to the agora, to the senate-house, to the innumerable\r\nporticoes everywhere abounding in Greece.[482]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 479:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Rep. t. vi. p. 86.

The lamps in common use,[484] though sometimes very\r\nbeautiful in shape, were of course fictile,[485] such as we find in\r\ngreat numbers among the ruins of Greek cities, both in the\r\nmother-country, and in their Egyptian and other colonies. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, they were of bronze, silver, or massive gold. A very beautiful\r\nspecimen in this last metal was found, by Lord Belmore, among the ruins\r\nof an Egyptian temple, a short time before my visit to the Nile. In many\r\nhouses were magnificent chandeliers, suspended from the ceiling, with\r\nnumerous branches, which filled the apartments[486] with a flood of\r\nlight. The most remarkable article of this kind which I remember was\r\nthat set up as a votive offering to Hestia, in the Prytaneion of\r\nTarentum, by Dionysios the Younger, which held as many lamps as there\r\nare days in the year.[487] Among people of humble condition wooden\r\nchandeliers, or candlesticks, were in use.[488] In remoter ages they\r\nburned slips of pine-branches, the bark of various trees, &c., instead\r\nof lamps. They were acquainted with the use of horn and wicker\r\nlanterns.[489]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 483:\r\n\r\n  An elegant candelabrum, ornamented with the figure of a twisted\r\n  serpent, and a flight of birds resting here and there on the branches,\r\n  is found in the Mus.

Even along the ceiling are ranged the\r\nornaments of Ares, glittering helmets, surmounted by white nodding\r\nplumes; greaves of polished brass are suspended on the walls, with\r\ncuirasses of linen, while, here and there, about my apartments, are\r\nscattered hollow shields. Elsewhere, you behold scimitars of Chalcis,\r\nand baldricks, and the short vest which we wear beneath our\r\narmour.”[492] Besides the articles enumerated by the poet, there were\r\nshield-cases, sheaths for their spears, quivers curiously adorned,\r\nfeathered arrows, and bows of polished horn, tipped at either end with\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 490:\r\n\r\n  The custom, also, in Lydia.

(vii. 60) That\r\n  is, “the _kupassis_ is a small linen chiton, reaching mid-thigh,\r\n  according to Ion, who says, ‘a short linen kupassis, descending to the\r\n  middle of the thigh.’”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom these gorgeous and costly commodities the reader, we fear, will be\r\nreluctant to accompany us into the kitchen, where we must pick our way\r\namong kneading-troughs, pots and pans, Delphian cutlery[493] and\r\nhoney-jars.[494] But as without these the warriors, as Homer himself\r\nacknowledges, could make but little use of their weapons, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary we should inquire into their cooking conveniences.\r\nTo commence, however, we must allow[495] Clearchos of Soli, to enumerate\r\na few of the articles found among the furniture of this important part\r\nof the house. There was, first, says he, a three-legged table, then a\r\nchytra, or earthen pot, which, as in France, was always preferred for\r\nmaking soup. It was not, however, of coarse brown ware, as with us; for,\r\nSocrates, in his conversation with Hippias on the Beautiful, observes\r\nthat, when properly made, round, smooth, and well-baked, the chytra was\r\nvery handsome, particularly that large sort which contained upwards of\r\nseven gallons. It had two handles, and was evidently glazed.[496] In\r\nstirring the chytra while boiling, the Attic cook made choice of a ladle\r\nturned from the wood of the fig-tree, which, it is said, communicated an\r\nagreeable flavour to the soup, and, in Socrates’s opinion, was\r\npreferable to one of gold which, being very weighty, might chance to\r\ncrack the pot, spill the broth, and extinguish the fire.[497]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 493:\r\n\r\n  Hesych. v.

Then followed the mortar, the stool, the\r\nsponge, the cauldron, the kneading-trough, the mug, the oil-flask, the\r\nrush-basket, the large knife, the cleaver,[498] the wooden platter, the\r\nbowl, and the larding-pin.[499] Pollux, who had, doubtless, served an\r\napprenticeship to Marcus Aurelius’s cook, gives a formidable list of\r\nculinary utensils, from which we must be content to select the most\r\nremarkable. First, however, we shall show how important a piece of\r\nsponge was to an Athenian cook. It often saved him his dinner; for, if\r\nany of his stewpans, crocks, or kettles, had suffered from the embraces\r\nof Hephæstos, in other words, had got a hole burnt in them, a bit of\r\nsponge was drawn into the aperture, and on went the cooking operations\r\nas before.[500] In some houses culinary utensils were regarded as a\r\nnuisance, the presence of which was not to be constantly endured, and,\r\naccordingly, when the master desired to treat his friends, cookey was\r\ndespatched early in the morning to hire pots and kettles of a broker. To\r\nthis custom Alexis alludes in his Exile:\r\n\r\n         How fertile in new tricks is Chæriphon,\r\n         To sup scot-free and everywhere find welcome!\r\n         Spies he a broker’s door with pots to let?\r\n         There from the earliest dawn he takes his stand,\r\n         To see whose cook arrives; from him he learns\r\n         Who ’tis that gives the feast,—flies to the house,\r\n         Watches his time, and, when the yawning door\r\n         Gapes for the guests, glides in among the first.[501]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 498:\r\n\r\n  See a figure, probably, of that instrument in Mus.

In fact,\r\n  similar contrivances are still resorted to, even in England.\r\n\r\nFootnote 501:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iv. 58.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut we must not pass over the Pyreion or Trypanon,[502] the clumsy\r\ncontrivance which supplied the place of our lucifers, phosphorus, and\r\ntinder-boxes. This was a hollow piece of wood, in which another piece\r\nwas turned rapidly till sparks of fire flew out.[503] Soldiers carried\r\nthese fire-kindlers along with them as a necessary part of their kit.\r\n\r\nFootnote 502:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

The use of the bellows[510] was known in Hellas from the\r\nremotest antiquity. They had likewise a kind of osier flap, with a\r\nhandle, and shaped like a fan, which at times supplied the place of\r\na pair of bellows.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 504:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Schol.

There will be no occasion in pursuing this investigation to\r\nadhere to any very strict method. It will probably be sufficient to make\r\na few broad divisions and a flexible outline which we can fill up as the\r\nmaterials fall in our way.\r\n\r\nWhat the original inhabitants of Hellas ate might no doubt be\r\nsatisfactorily inferred from the accounts we possess of nations still\r\nexisting in the same state of civilisation. But it is nevertheless\r\ncurious to examine their traditions relating to the subject. Ælian, who\r\nhas preserved many notices of remote antiquity, gives a list of various\r\nkinds of food, which, as he would appear to think, constituted the\r\nchief, if not the whole, sustenance of several ancient nations. The\r\nArcadians lived, he says, upon acorns; the Argives upon pears, the\r\nAthenians upon figs;[515] the wild pear-tree furnished the Tirynthians\r\nwith their favourite food; a sort of cane was the chief dainty of the\r\nIndians; of the Karamanians[516] the date; millet of the Mæotæ and\r\nSauromatæ; while the Persians[517] delighted chiefly in cardamums and\r\npistachio nuts.[518]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 515:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Perieg. 1082.\r\n\r\nFootnote 517:\r\n\r\n  These people were great eaters, and held none in estimation but those\r\n  who resembled them. Aristoph. Acharn. 74. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 518:\r\n\r\n  Ælian. Var. Hist. iii. 39. Perizonius in his note on this passage\r\n  observes, that ἄπιος and ἀχράς are but different names for the same\r\n  thing, both signifying “the pear,” the former term prevailing among\r\n  the Argives, the latter among the Tirynthians and Laconians. By the\r\n  other Greeks both words were used promiscuously, though ἄπιος was the\r\n  more common. This able commentator objects to the assertion of his\r\n  author, that the Hindoos lived on cane, since they also ate millet,\r\n  rice, &c. But Ælian could really have intended nothing more than that\r\n  the articles he enumerates were in common use among the nations spoken\r\n  of. Otherwise the whole must be regarded as a mere fable. The canes,\r\n  mentioned by Ælian, are those from which sugar has been from very\r\n  remote antiquity extracted.\r\n\r\n        Quique bibunt tenerâ dulces ab arundine succos.\r\n                                        Lucan. Pharsal. iii. 237.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe tradition that while some degree of civilisation already existed in\r\nthe East, many tribes of Hellas still subsisted upon acorns, has given\r\nrise to much curious disquisition. It is abundantly clear, however, that\r\nthe fruit of our English oak is not what is meant; for, upon this, no\r\none who has made the experiment will for one moment imagine that man\r\ncould subsist; but every kind of production comprehended by the Greeks\r\nunder the term “acorn,” (βάλανος). Gerard, an old English botanist,\r\nenumerates chestnuts among acorns, and Xenophon calls dates “the acorns\r\nof the palm-tree.” The mast, however, of a tree common in Greece, would,\r\nas Mitford thinks, afford a not unwholesome nourishment, though he is\r\nquite right in supposing that it could not have been a favourite food in\r\nmore civilised times.[519] While upon the subject of acorns, this\r\ningenious and able writer appears disposed to make somewhat merry with a\r\ncertain project of Socrates. If we rightly comprehend him, which very\r\npossibly we do not, he means to accuse the philosopher of reducing the\r\ncitizens of his airy republic to very short commons indeed,[520] nothing\r\nbut a little beech-mast, and a few myrtle-berries. This borders strongly\r\non the notion of the comic writer, who describes the Athenians as living\r\non air and hope. But though abstemious enough, Socrates was not so\r\nunreasonable as to require even his Utopians to fight and philosophise\r\nupon a diet so scanty. Before he comes to the mast and the\r\nmyrtle-berries, we find him enumerating wheaten and barley bread, salt,\r\nolives, cheese, and truffles, together with pulse and all such herbs as\r\nthe fields spontaneously produce. For a dessert he would indulge them\r\nwith figs, chickpeas, and beans, myrtle-berries, and beech-mast, or\r\nchestnuts roasted in the fire. Plato was aware how the luxurious wits of\r\nhis time would turn up their noses at such primitive diet, and therefore\r\nbrings in Glaucon inquiring,—“If you were founding a polity of swine,\r\nwhat other food would you provide for them?”[521] Pausanias remarks,\r\nhowever, that acorns long continued to be a common article of food in\r\nArcadia,[522] but only those of the fagus.[523]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 519:\r\n\r\n  See Goguet, i. 160, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 520:\r\n\r\n  Hist. of Greece, i. 9, note.

This Arcadian dainty is\r\n  still eaten in Spain. “In some parts (of Navarre) the mountains are\r\n  girt at their base by forests of chestnut trees or of the Spanish oak\r\n  called _encina_, whose acorn roasted, is as palatable as the\r\n  chestnut.” (A Campaign with Zumalacarregui, i. 40.) The same writer\r\n  observes, that the fruit of the ever-green arbutus, in shape like a\r\n  cherry, though insipid and intoxicating in its effects, is also eaten\r\n  by the omniverous Spaniards, p. 51. See also Laborde’s Itinerary of\r\n  Spain, iv. 80, and Capell Brooke’s Travels, ii. 72.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf we may credit some writers the ancient inhabitants of Hellas made use\r\nof food much more revolting than acorns, having been, in fact, cannibals\r\nwho devoured each other. There, no doubt, existed among the Greeks of\r\nlater times traditions of a state of society in which human flesh was\r\neaten by certain fierce and lawless individuals, such as Polyphemos, but\r\nnothing in their literature can authorise us to infer that the practice\r\nwas ever general. Superstition seems on very extraordinary occasions to\r\nhave impelled them into the guilt of human sacrifice, when the\r\nofficiating priests, and, perhaps, some few others, probably tasted of\r\nthe entrails, and Galen had conversed with individuals who had been led\r\nby mere curiosity to sup on man’s flesh, and found its flavour to\r\nresemble that of tender beef.[524] But instances of this kind prove\r\nnothing; for how often does it not happen that mariners are even now\r\ndriven by distressful circumstances to slaughter and eat their\r\ncompanions at sea! And yet shall we on this account pass for\r\nanthropophagi with posterity?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 524:\r\n\r\n  See Bochart. Geog. Sac. i. 309.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, however, were not content with one set of traditions, or\r\nupon the whole inclined to give currency to the most gloomy. On the\r\ncontrary, their poets casting backward the light of their imagination,\r\nand kindling up the landscapes of the far past, called up the vision of\r\nthe golden age, when neither the domestic hearth[525] nor the altars of\r\nthe gods were stained with blood, and the fruits of the field,—milk,\r\nhoney, cheese, and butter sufficed to sustain life. But we must escape\r\nfrom these shadowy times, and come down to the age of beef and mutton.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 525:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Plat. De Legg. vi. t. vii. p. 471.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFood is, with great precision, divided by Aristotle into moist and dry,\r\nthat is, into meat and drink.[526] A classification, the credit of\r\nwhich, as Feith contends, belongs to Homer.[527] In this poet, bread\r\n(σίτος), the principal article of provision, is made indiscriminately\r\nboth from wheat and barley, though the latter grain is thought to have\r\nbeen first in use.[528] Herodotus found, in the matter of bread, a\r\npeculiar taste among the Egyptians; barley and wheat they despised,\r\nthough in no country are finer produced than in Egypt; giving, very\r\nstrangely, the preference to the _olyra_, by some supposed to be the\r\nspelt, but more probably Syrian _dhourra_, ears of which I observed\r\nsculptured on the interior of the pronaos of Leto’s temple at Esneh.\r\nBread, in the Homeric age, was brought to table in a reed basket, the\r\nuse of silver bread-baskets, or trays, not having been then, as Donatus\r\nthinks, introduced. But in this the learned commentator is mistaken; or,\r\nif they had no silver trays, at least they had them of brass and gold,\r\nto match their tables of massive silver.[529]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 526:\r\n\r\n  Problem. x. 56, 58.\r\n\r\nFootnote 527:\r\n\r\n  Iliad. α. 496. β. 432, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 528:\r\n\r\n  Iliad. ε. 196, et 341. The scholiast on this verse, observes that,\r\n  before the invention of mills, men used to eat the raw grain. (Cf. on\r\n  Iliad. α. 449, and Etym. Magn. v. οὐλόχυται, 641, 29.) But this is\r\n  merely an absurd conjecture; for they could, at least, have roasted\r\n  the young ear as in the East they still do, while it is full of juice,\r\n  and have eaten it thus with salt, when it is both pleasant and\r\n  nutritive. Besides, some means of reducing the grain to meal appears\r\n  to have been known almost from the beginning.\r\n\r\nFootnote 529:\r\n\r\n  Iliad. λ. 629. Odyss. κ. 355. See, too, Theocrit. Eidyll. xxiv. 135,\r\n  sqq. Virgil. Æneid. i. 705.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNext to bread, flesh, in the heroic ages, was the greatest stay-stomach,\r\nparticularly beef, kid, mutton, and pork. They had not, however, as yet\r\ndiscovered many ways of cooking it. Nearly all their culinary ingenuity\r\nreduced itself in fact to roasting and boiling, a circumstance which led\r\nAthenæus,[530] and the president Goguet to look back with great pity and\r\nconcern on these unhappy ages when even princes, generally gourmands,\r\nwere deprived of the supreme felicity of dining on ragouts, soups, and\r\nboiled brains. Servius,[531] too, and Varro are inclined to participate\r\nin this feeling of commiseration, and the latter observes, that among\r\ntheir own ancestors people were originally compelled to dine on roast\r\nmeat, though in the course of time the arts of boiling and soup-making\r\nwere introduced.[532] With regard to Homer’s heroes, however, our\r\nsympathies are somewhat relieved by finding, that learned men have\r\noverrated the extent of their misfortunes. They were not altogether\r\nignorant of the art of boiling, as Athenæus himself admits, where he\r\nmentions the boiled shin of beef which one of the drunken suitors flung\r\nat Odysseus’s head.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 530:\r\n\r\n  Deipnosoph. i. 15. Origine des Loix, ii. 306. “J’ai dit que la\r\n  simplicité faisoit le caractère distinctif de ses premiers âges. La\r\n  manière dont on se nourissoit alors en fait preuve. On ne voit\r\n  paroître ni sauce ni ragoût, ni même de gibier, dans la description\r\n  que l’Ecriture fait du repas donné par Abraham aux trois anges qui lui\r\n  apparurent dans la vallée de Membré. Ce Patriarche leur sert un veau\r\n  roti, ou, pour mieux dire, grillé; du lait de beurre, et du pain frais\r\n  cuit sous la cendre. Voilà tout le festin. Ce fait montre que les\r\n  repas alors étoient plus solides que délicats. Abraham avoit\r\n  certainement intention de traiter ses hôtes du mieux qu’il lui étoit\r\n  possible, et il faut observer que ce Patriarche possédoit de\r\n  très-grandes richesses en or, en argent, en troupeaux et en esclaves.\r\n  On peut donc regarder le repas qu’il donne aux trois anges, comme le\r\n  modèle d’un festin magnifique, et juger en conséquence quelle étoit de\r\n  son tems la manière de traiter splendidement.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 531:\r\n\r\n  Comm. ad Æneid. i. 710.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe flesh of young animals was not habitually eaten in those early ages,\r\nso that in denominating them public devourers of kids and lambs, Priam\r\naccuses his sons of scandalous luxury.[533] In fact, with the design of\r\npreventing a scarcity of animal food, a law was enacted at Athens\r\nprohibiting the slaughter of an unshorn lamb, and from the same motive\r\nthe Emperor Valens forbade the use of veal.[534]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 532:\r\n\r\n  Feith, Antiq.

The Egyptians had a very\r\npeculiar taste in ornithophagy, and actually ate some kinds of birds\r\nquite raw, as they likewise did several species of fish; and this not in\r\nthose early ages when Isis and Osiris had not reclaimed the bogs of the\r\nNile, but in times quite modern, when Herodotus travelled in their\r\ncountry, and heard their vain priests lay claim to having civilised\r\nHellas. Both birds and fish, indeed, underwent a certain sort of\r\npreparation. Of the latter some were dried in the sun, others preserved\r\nin pickle, and the same process was applied to ducks, quails, and many\r\nother species of birds, after which they were eaten raw. We recommend\r\nthe practice to our gourmands, and have no doubt they would find a\r\npickled owl or jackdaw, devoured in the Egyptian style, altogether as\r\nwholesome as diseased goose’s liver. It must not, however, be\r\ndissembled, that many critics, concerned for the gastronomic reputation\r\nof the Egyptians, contend that, by the word which we translate “to\r\npickle,”[537] Herodotus must have meant some kind of cookery; to which\r\nWesseling replies, that, without designing to impugn the taste of those\r\ngentlemen, he must yet refuse to accept of their interpretation, since\r\nby observing that they roasted or boiled all other species of birds and\r\nfish, such as were sacred excepted, the historian evidently intends to\r\nsay, that these were eaten raw. The learned editor might have added,\r\nthat Herodotus uses the same term in treating of the process of\r\nembalming,[538] and we nowhere learn that the mummies were cooked before\r\nthey were deposited in the tombs.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 535:\r\n\r\n  Od. ι. 185. κ. 180.\r\n\r\nFootnote 536:\r\n\r\n  Iliad. ψ. 852, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 537:\r\n\r\n  Προταριχεύειν.

At all\r\nevents the common people understood the value of this kind of food,[540]\r\nand it may safely be inferred that their betters, never slow in\r\nappropriating delicacies to their own use, soon perceived that fish is\r\nno bad eating. Hunger would at least reconcile them to the flavour of\r\nbroiled salmon, as we find by the example of Odysseus’s companions, who\r\ndevoured both fish and fowl.[541] This is acknowledged by Athenæus;[542]\r\nbut Plutarch contends, that they could have been driven to it only by\r\nextreme necessity. At all other times he imagines they temperately\r\nabstained from food of so exciting a kind,[543] though Homer describes\r\nthe Hellespont as abounding in fish,[544] and more than once alludes to\r\nthe practice of drawing it thence with hook and line.[545] Thus we find\r\nthat angling can trace back its pedigree to the heroic ages; and the\r\ndisciple of the rod as he trudges with Izaak in his pocket through bog\r\nand mire in search of a good bite, may solace his imagination with\r\nreminiscences of Troy and the Hellespont. But the good people of those\r\ndays did not wholly rely for a supply of fish on this very tedious and\r\ninefficient process; they had discovered the use of nets, which Homer\r\ndescribes the fisherman casting on the sea shore.[546] Though the poet,\r\nhowever, had omitted all allusion to this kind of food, its use might,\r\nnevertheless, have been confidently inferred, as may that of milk,\r\ncommon to all nations, though Homer mentions it only, I believe, in the\r\ncase of the Hippomolgians,[547] and the cannibal Polyphemus, who\r\nunderstood also the luxury of cheese.[548] Circe, too, who being a\r\ngoddess may be supposed to have been a connoisseur in dainties, presents\r\nher paramour Odysseus with a curious mixture, consisting of cheese,\r\nhoney, flour, and wine,[549] very savoury, no doubt, and by old Nestor\r\nconsidered of salutary nature, since Hecamedè, at his order, prepares a\r\nplentiful supply of it for the wounded Machaon. Along with this posset,\r\ngarlic was eaten as a relish.[550]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 539:\r\n\r\n  Plato, among others, remarks that, in the military messes of his\r\n  heroes, Homer introduces neither fish nor boiled meat.

Apples seem then, as now, to have\r\nconstituted a favourite portion of the dessert, though among the Homeric\r\nwarriors they seem sometimes to have formed a principal part of the\r\nmeal; for Servius[555] describes the primitive repasts as consisting of\r\ntwo courses, of which the first was animal food, and apples the second.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 551:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Accordingly they had neither poets nor\r\ninn-keepers, nor excisemen,—three classes of persons who never flourish\r\nbut where wine, or at least beer, is found. Homer more than once alludes\r\nto this vicious habit of the old world, where, with a sly insinuation of\r\ncontempt,—for he was himself partial to the blood-red wine,—he tells us\r\nthat this or that nation drank, like so many oxen or crocodiles, of the\r\nwaters of such or such a river. Thus, when enumerating the allies of\r\nIlion, he describes the Zeleians as those who sipped the black waters of\r\nthe Æsepos.[563] Pindar, too, in the hope of obtaining a reputation for\r\nsobriety, says, he was accustomed to drink the waters of Thebes, which,\r\nin his opinion, were very delicious,[564] though Hippocrates would\r\nunquestionably have been of a totally different way of thinking. The\r\nPersian, and afterwards the Parthian kings, appear in many cases to have\r\nentertained a temperate predilection for the water of certain streams,\r\nof which Milton has given eternal celebrity to one:—\r\n\r\n                           “Choaspes, amber stream,\r\n                   The drink of none but kings.”[565]\r\n\r\nBut evidently through mistake; for though historians pretend that the\r\nParthian monarchs would drink of no water save that of the Choaspes, to\r\nwhich Pliny[566] adds the Eulæus, it is by no means said that they\r\nenjoyed a monopoly of those streams. Perhaps our great poet confounded\r\nthe Choaspes with those Golden Waters which, in Athenæus, are said to\r\nhave been wholly reserved for the use of the king and his eldest\r\nson.[567]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 563:\r\n\r\n  Il. β. 824, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 564:\r\n\r\n  Pind.

With whomsoever its use began, wine was well\r\nknown to Homer’s heroes, one of whom speaks of it, in conjunction with\r\nbread, as the chief root of man’s strength and vigour.[568] Yet the\r\nwarriors of those ages by no means exhibited that selfish parsimony\r\nwhich led the Romans to debar their matrons the use of wine.[569] In\r\nHomer we find women, even while very young, permitted the enjoyment of\r\nit: for example, Nausicaa and her companions, who, in setting forth on\r\ntheir washing excursion, are furnished by the queen herself with a\r\nplentiful supply of provisions, and a skin of wine.[570] Boys, likewise,\r\nin the heroic ages, met with similar indulgence; for Phœnix is\r\nrepresented permitting Achilles to join him in his potations before the\r\nlittle urchin knew how to drink without spilling it over himself.[571]\r\nThis practice, however, is very properly condemned by Plato, who\r\nconsidered that no person under eighteen should be allowed to taste of\r\nwine, and even then but sparingly.[572] After thirty, more discretion\r\nmight, he thought, be granted them; though he recommended sobriety at\r\nall times, save, perhaps, on the anniversary festival of Dionysos, and\r\ncertain other divinities, when a merry bowl was judged in keeping with\r\nthe other ceremonies of the day.[573]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 568:\r\n\r\n  Iliad, ι. 702. τ. 161.\r\n\r\nFootnote 569:\r\n\r\n  Athen. x. 33.\r\n\r\nFootnote 570:\r\n\r\n  Od. ζ. 77, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 571:\r\n\r\n  Iliad. ι. 487.\r\n\r\nFootnote 572:\r\n\r\n  Montaigne, whom few things of this kind had escaped, reads _forty_,\r\n  and thinks that men might lawfully get drunk after that age.

The reader, not already familiar with the\r\ngastronomic fragments of ancient literature, will probably be surprised\r\nat the omniverous character of the Greeks, to whom nothing seems to have\r\ncome amiss, from the nettle-top to the peach, from the sow’s metra to\r\nthe most delicate bird, from the shark to the small semi-transparent\r\naphyæ, caught along the shores of Attica.[574] Through this ocean of\r\ndainties we shall endeavour to make our way on the following\r\nplan:—first, it will be our “hint to speak” of the more solid kinds of\r\nfood, as beef, mutton, pork, veal; we shall then make a transition to\r\nthe soups, fowls, and fish; next the fruit will claim our attention;\r\nand, lastly, the several varieties of wines.\r\n\r\nFootnote 574:\r\n\r\n  Ass’s flesh was commonly eaten by the Athenians.

They saw it endued with less intelligence than other\r\nanimals; and, from its stupidity, inferred that it ought to be eaten,\r\nits soul merely serving during life, as salt, to keep the flesh from\r\nputrefying.[576] The determining reason, however, appears to have been,\r\nthat they could make no other use of him, since he would neither plough\r\nlike the ox, nor be saddled and mounted like the horse or ass, nor\r\nbecome a pleasant companion, or guard the house, like the dog.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 575:\r\n\r\n  Plato, De Legg. vi. t. vii. p. 471.\r\n\r\nFootnote 576:\r\n\r\n  Cicero, De Natura Deorum, ii. 64.

Chrysost. i. 280, cum not.\r\n  Reisk.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt was long before men in any country slew the ox for food; his great\r\nutility was his protection, and in some parts of the East the\r\nwell-meaning priesthood at length compassed him round with the armour of\r\nsuperstition, which outlasted the occasion, and in India has come down\r\nin nearly all its strength to our own day. It was otherwise in Greece.\r\nThere common sense quickly dissipated the illusion, which, while it was\r\nnecessary, had guarded the ox, and beef became the favourite food of its\r\nhardy and active inhabitants, who likewise fed indiscriminately on\r\nsheep, goats, deer, hares, and almost every other animal, wild or tame.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that in remote ages fish did not constitute any great\r\npart of the sustenance of the Greeks. But public opinion afterwards\r\nunderwent a very considerable change. From having been held in so little\r\nestimation as to be left chiefly to the use of the poor, in the\r\nhistorical ages it became their greatest luxury.[577] And there arose\r\namong gourmands, those ancient St. Simonians, whose god was their belly,\r\na kind of enthusiastic rivalry as to who should be first in the morning\r\nat the fish-market, and bear away, as in triumph, the largest Copaic\r\neels, the finest pair of soles, or the freshest _anthias_.[578] On this\r\nsubject, therefore, our details must be somewhat more elaborate than on\r\nbeef and mutton. And first, we shall take the reader along with us to\r\nthe market, whither it will be advisable that he carry as little money\r\nas possible, since, according to the comic poets, your Athenian\r\nfishmonger, not content with being a mere rogue, dealt a little also in\r\nthe assassin’s trade.[579]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 577:\r\n\r\n  The Pythagoreans, however, must be excluded from this category since\r\n  they abstained from fish because they kept perpetual silence like\r\n  themselves.—Athen. vii. 80. Another and a better reason, perhaps, may\r\n  be discovered in a passage of Archestratos, who, observing that the\r\n  sea-dog is delicious eating, proceeds to dispose of the objection that\r\n  it feeds on human flesh, by saying, that all fish do the same. Id.\r\n  vii. 85. From this fact the Pythagoreans esteemed fish-eaters no\r\n  better than cannibals at second-hand.\r\n\r\nFootnote 578:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Schol. Aristoph.

If from the north, and there was anything like a sea,\r\nhe remained sullenly at home, for no fishing smacks could in that case\r\nmake the Peiræeus;[580] but if the wind sat in any other quarter, out he\r\nwent eagerly and stealthily with a slave and basket[581] at his heels,\r\ncasting about anxious looks to discover whether any other impassioned\r\nfish-eater had got the start of him on his way to the Agora, who might\r\nclear the stalls of the best anthias or thunny before he could reach the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 580:\r\n\r\n  Athen. viii. 81. Cf. Xenoph. Hellen. v. i. 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 581:\r\n\r\n  This basket was usually of rushes, in form like a basin, and with a\r\n  handle passing over the top.—Antich. di Ercol. tav. 21. tom. i. p.\r\n  111.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe unmoneyed rogue, however, whose ambitious taste soared to these\r\nexpensive dainties, approached the market with a rueful countenance.\r\nThus we find a poor fellow describing, in Antiphanes, his morning’s\r\npilgrimage in search of a pair of soles:\r\n\r\n            I once believed the Gorgons fabulous:\r\n            But in the agora quickly changed my creed,\r\n            And turned almost to stone, the pests beholding\r\n            Standing behind the fish stalls. Forced I am\r\n            To look another way when I accost them,\r\n            Lest if I saw the fish they ask so much for,\r\n            I should at once grow marble.[582]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 582:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAmphis, another comic poet, supplies us with further details respecting\r\nthe hardships encountered by those who had to deal with fishmongers at\r\nAthens. Much of his wit is, I fear, intransferable, depending in a great\r\nmeasure on the vernacular clipping of Greek common in the market-place.\r\nBut the sense, at least, may perhaps be given:\r\n\r\n          “Ten thousand times more easy ’tis to gain\r\n          Admission to a haughty general’s tent,\r\n          And have discourse of him, than in the market\r\n          Audience to get of a cursed fishmonger.\r\n          If you draw near and say, How much, my friend,\r\n          Costs _this_ or _that_?—No answer. Deaf you think\r\n          The rogue must be, or stupid; for he heeds not\r\n          A syllable you say, but o’er his fish\r\n          Bends silently like Telephos (and with good reason,\r\n          For his whole race he knows are cut-throats all).\r\n          Another minding not, or else not hearing,\r\n          Pulls by the legs a polypus.[583] A third\r\n          With saucy carelessness replies, ‘Four oboli,\r\n          That’s just the price. For this no less than eight.\r\n          Take it or leave it!’”[584]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 583:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Chandler, ii. 143. Plin. Hist. Nat. ix. 45, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 584:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAlexis, too, that most comic of comic writers, seems to have imagined,\r\nthat the humour of his pieces would be incomplete without a spice of the\r\nfishmonger. Commencing, like Amphis, with an allusion to the haughty\r\nairs of military men, he glides into his subject as follows:—\r\n\r\n         However, this is still endurable.\r\n         But when a paltry fishfag will look big,\r\n         Cast down his eyes affectedly, or bend\r\n         His eyebrows upwards like a fullstrained bow,\r\n         I burst with rage. Demand what price he asks\r\n         For—say two mullets; and he answers straight\r\n         “Ten obols”—“Ten? That’s dear: will you take eight?”\r\n         “Yes, if one fish will serve you.”—“Friend, no jokes;\r\n         I am no subject for your mirth.”—“Pass on, Sir!\r\n         And buy elsewhere.”—Now tell me is not this\r\n         Bitterer than gall?[585]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 585:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut if the reader should be disposed to infer from these testimonies\r\nthat the fishmongering race were saucy only at Athens, he will be in\r\ndanger of falling into error. Throughout the ancient world they were the\r\nsame, and we fear that should any poor devil from Grub-street, or the\r\n_Quartier Latin_, presume to dispute respecting the price of salmon with\r\none of their cockney or Parisian descendants, he would meet with little\r\nmore politeness. At all events their manners had not improved in the\r\nEternal city,[586] for it is _a propos_ of the Roman fishfags that\r\nAthenæus brings forward his examples of like insolence elsewhere. The\r\npoet Diphilos would appear, like Archestratos, to have travelled in\r\nsearch of good fish and civil fishmongers, but his labours were\r\nfruitless; he might as well have peregrinated the world in the hope of\r\nfinding that island where soles are caught ready-fried in the sea. Such\r\nat least is the tenour of his own complaint:\r\n\r\n            Troth, in my greener days I had some notion\r\n            That here at Athens only, rogues sold fish;\r\n            But everywhere, it seems, like wolf or fox,\r\n            The race is treacherous by nature found.\r\n            However, we have one scamp in the agora\r\n            Who beats all others hollow. On his head\r\n            A most portentous fell of hair nods thick\r\n            And shades his brow. Observing your surprise,\r\n            He has his reasons pat; it grows forsooth\r\n            To form, when shorn, an offering to some god!\r\n            But that’s a feint, ’tis but to hide the scars\r\n            Left by the branding iron upon his forehead.\r\n            But, passing that, you ask perchance the price\r\n            Of a sea-wolf—“Ten oboli”—very good.\r\n            You count the money. “Oh not those,” he cries,\r\n            “Æginetan I meant.” Still you comply.\r\n            But if you trust him with a larger piece,\r\n            And there be change to give; mark how the knave\r\n            Now counts in Attic coin, and thus achieves\r\n            A two-fold robbery in the same transaction![587]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 586:\r\n\r\n  Deipnosoph. vi. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 587:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 6.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nXenarchos paints a little scene of ingenious roguery with a comic\r\nextravagance altogether Shakespearian, and incidentally throws light on\r\na curious law of Athens, enacted to protect the citizens against\r\nstinking fish.[588] The power of invention, he observes—willing to kill\r\ntwo birds with one stone—had totally deserted the poets in order to take\r\nup with the fishmongers; for while the former merely hashed up old\r\nideas, the latter were always hitting upon new contrivances to poison\r\nthe Demos:\r\n\r\n            Commend me for invention to the rogue\r\n            Who sells fish in the agora. He knows\r\n            In fact there’s no mistaking,—that the law\r\n            Clearly and formally forbids the trick\r\n            Of reconciling stale fish to the nose\r\n            By constant watering. But if some poor wight\r\n            Detect him in the fact, forthwith he picks\r\n            A quarrel, and provokes his man to blows.\r\n            He wheels meanwhile about his fish, looks sharp\r\n            To catch the nick of time, reels, feigns a hurt:\r\n            And prostrate falls, just in the right position.\r\n            A friend placed there on purpose, snatches up\r\n            A pot of water, sprinkles a drop or two,\r\n            For form’s sake on his face, but by mistake,\r\n            As you must sure believe, pours all the rest\r\n            Full on the fish, so that almost you might\r\n            Consider them fresh caught.[589]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 588:\r\n\r\n  The longer to preserve fish fresh, the Orientals sometimes cover them\r\n  with a coating of wax. Mullets, caught at Damietta, are sent, thus\r\n  preserved, throughout the Turkish Empire, as well as to different\r\n  parts of Europe. Pococke’s Description of the East.\r\n\r\nFootnote 589:\r\n\r\n  Our readers will probably remember the good old Italian marchioness,\r\n  who having, perhaps, been cajoled, by the blarney of some Hibernian\r\n  peripatetic, into the purchase of a pair of strong-odoured soles,\r\n  recommended to our magistrates the adoption of an ordinance passed, as\r\n  she affirmed, by his grace of Tuscany. In that prince’s territories,\r\n  she assured their worships, the man who has fish to sell, must\r\n  transact business standing on one leg in a bucket of hot water, a\r\n  practice undoubtedly calculated to induce despatch and prevent\r\n  haggling. This Tuscan enactment might evidently have been adopted with\r\n  great advantage at Athens, where, however, legislation proceeded on\r\n  exactly the same principles, and attained in this point an almost\r\n  equal degree of perfection.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBy a law passed at the instance of the wealthy Aristonicos, himself no\r\ndoubt an ichthyophagos, the penalty of imprisonment was decreed against\r\nall those who, having named a price for their fish, should take less, in\r\norder that they might at once demand what was just and no more. In\r\nconsequence of this enactment, an old woman or a child might be sent to\r\nthe fish-market, without danger of being cheated. According to another\r\nprovision of this Golden Law, as it is termed by Alexis, fishmongers\r\nwere compelled to stand at their stalls and not to sit as had previously\r\nbeen the custom. The comic poet, in the fulness of his charity,\r\nexpresses a hope that they might be all _suspended_ aloft on the\r\nfollowing year, by which means, he says, they would get a quicker sight\r\nof their customers, and carry on their dealings with mankind from a\r\nmachine like the gods of tragedy.[590]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 590:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn consequence no doubt of the perpetually increasing demand, fish was\r\nextremely dear at Athens. Accordingly Diphilos, addressing himself to\r\nPoseidon, who, as god of the sea, was god also of its inhabitants,\r\ninforms him that, could he but secure the tithe of fish, he would soon\r\nbecome the wealthiest divinity in Olympos. Among those who distinguished\r\nthemselves in this business in the agora, and apparently became rich, it\r\nis probable that many were metoiki, such as Hermæos, the Egyptian, and\r\nMikion, who, though his country is not mentioned, was probably not an\r\nAthenian. In proportion as they grew opulent, the gourmands on whom they\r\npreyed became poor, and doubtless there was too much truth in the satire\r\nwhich represented men dissipating their whole fortunes in the\r\nfrying-pan. There were those also it seems who spent their evenings on\r\nthe highway, in order to furnish their daily table with such dainties.\r\nFor this fact we have the satisfactory testimony of Alexis in his\r\nHeiress:\r\n\r\n         Mark you a fellow who, however scant\r\n         In all things else, hath still wherewith to purchase\r\n         Cod, eel, or anchovies, be sure i’ the dark\r\n         He lies about the road in wait for travellers.\r\n         If therefore you’ve been robbed o’ernight, just go\r\n         At peep of dawn to th’ agora and seize\r\n         The first athletic, ragged vagabond\r\n         Who cheapens eels of Mikion. He, be sure,\r\n         And none but he’s the thief: to prison with him![591]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 591:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 10. 12.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThey had at Corinth a pretty strict police regulation on this subject.\r\nWhen any person was observed habitually to purchase fish, he was\r\ninterrogated by the authorities respecting his means. If found to be a\r\nman of property they suffered him to do what he pleased with his own;\r\nbut, in the contrary event, he received a gentle hint that the state had\r\nits eye upon him. The neglect of this admonition was followed, in the\r\nfirst place, by a fine, and ultimately, if persevered in, by a\r\npunishment equivalent to the treadmill.[592] These matters were in\r\nAthens submitted to the cognizance of two or three magistrates, called\r\nOpsonomoi, nominated by the Senate.[593] With respect to the purchase of\r\nthis class of viands, everywhere attended with peculiar difficulties, it\r\nmay be said, that the ancients had considerably the advantage of us;\r\nsince in Lynceus of Samos’s “Fish-buyer’s Manual,” they possessed a sure\r\nguide through all the intricacies of bargaining in the agora.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 592:\r\n\r\n  Diphilos apud Athen. vi. 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 593:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 72.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut before we proceed further with this part of our subject, we will\r\ndemand permission of Lynceus to hear what Hesiod has to say of saltfish,\r\non which Euthydemos, the Athenian, composed a separate treatise.\r\nAccording to this poet, who boldly speaks of cities erected long after\r\nhis death, immense quantities of fish were salted on the Bosporos,\r\nsometimes entire, as in modern times,[594] sometimes cut into gobbets of\r\na moderate size. Among these were the oxyrinchos whose taste proved\r\noften fatal, the thunny, and the mackerel. The little city of Parion\r\nfurnished the best kolias (a kind of mackerel), and the Tarentine\r\nmerchants brought to Athens pickled orcynos from Cadiz, cut into small\r\ntriangular pieces, in jars.[595] Physicians, indeed, inveighed against\r\nthese relishes; but the gourmands would consult only their palates and\r\npreferred a short life with pickled thunny to that of Saturn himself on\r\nbeef and mutton.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 594:\r\n\r\n  Herod. iv. 53.\r\n\r\nFootnote 595:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 84.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut the Hesiod of Euthydemos (a creation probably of his own) is but\r\nvery poor authority compared with Archestratos, who made the pilgrimage\r\nof the world in search of good cheer, and afterwards, for the benefit of\r\nposterity, treasured up his experience in a grand culinary epic. In his\r\nopinion a slice of Sicilian thunny was a rare delicacy, while the\r\nsaperda, though brought from the Pontos Euxinos, he held as cheap as\r\nthose who boasted of it.[596] The scombros, by some supposed to be a\r\nspecies of thunny, though others understand by it the common mackerel,\r\nstood high in the estimation of this connoisseur. He directs that it be\r\nleft in salt three days, and eaten before it begins to melt into\r\nbrine.[597] In his estimation the horaion[598] of Byzantium was likewise\r\na great delicacy, which he advises the traveller, who might pass through\r\nthat city, to taste by all means. It seems to have been there what\r\nmacaroni is at Naples.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 596:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 85.\r\n\r\nFootnote 597:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 85.

An omotarichos (shoulder piece of thunny)\r\nis charged at five chalci; a dish of sea-mussels, seven chalci, of\r\nsea-urchins, an obol, a slice of kybion, three obols, a conger eel, ten,\r\nand another plate of broiled fish, a drachma. This comic writer[599]\r\nrates the fish of the Nile very low, and he is quite right, for they are\r\ngenerally muddy and ill-tasted, though the Copts, who have considerable\r\nexperience during Lent, contrive, by the application of much\r\nArchestratic skill, to render some kinds of them palatable. Sophocles,\r\nin a fragment of his lost drama of Phineus, speaks of salt-fish embalmed\r\nlike an Egyptian mummy.[600] Stock-fish, as I know to my cost, is still\r\na fashionable dish in the Mediterranean, especially on board ship, and\r\nfrom a proverb preserved by Athenæus we find it was likewise in use\r\namong the Athenians.[601]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 599:\r\n\r\n  Ap.

They bestowed the rights\r\nof citizenship on the sons of Chæriphilos, a metoikos who first\r\nintroduced among them a knowledge of this sort of food.[602] A similar\r\nfeeling prompted the Dutch to erect a statue to G. Bukel, the man who\r\ntaught them to salt herrings.[603]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 602:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 90.\r\n\r\nFootnote 603:\r\n\r\n  Goguet, Origine des Loix, i. 254.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWithout enumerating a tenth part of the other species eaten among the\r\nGreeks, we pass to the shell-fish, of which they were likewise great\r\namateurs. Epicharmos, in his marriage of Hebe, supplies a curious list,\r\nwhich, however, might be extended almost ad infinitum. Among these were\r\nimmense limpets, the buccinum, the cecibalos, the tethynakion, the\r\nsea-acorn, the purple fish, oysters hard to open but easy to swallow,\r\nmussels, sea-snails or periwinkles, skiphydria sweet to taste but\r\nprickly to touch, large shelled razor-fish, the black conch, and the\r\namathitis. The conch was also called tellinè as the same poet in his\r\nMuses observes. Alcæos wrote a song to the limpet beginning with\r\n\r\n                “Child of the rock and hoary sea.”[604]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 604:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 30, 31. Cf. Scheigh. Animadv. t. vii. p. 68, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBoys used to make a sort of whistle of tortoise and mussel shells. These\r\nmussels were usually broiled on the coals, and Aristophanes, very\r\ningenious in his similes, compares a gaping silly fellow to a mussel in\r\nthe act of being cooked.[605]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 605:\r\n\r\n  Fragm. Babylon. 2. Brunck. Athen. iii. 33.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nLike the sepia, of which excellent pilaus are made at Alexandria, the\r\nporphyra or purple fish was very good eating, and thickened the liquor\r\nin which it was boiled.[606] There was a small delicate shell-fish\r\ncaught on the island of Pharos and adjacent coasts of Egypt, which they\r\ncalled Aphrodite’s ear,[607] and there is still found on the same coast\r\nnear Canopos a diminutive and beautiful rose-coloured conch called\r\nVenus’s nipple. On the same shore, about the rise of the Nile, that\r\nspecies of mussel called tellinè was caught in great abundance, but the\r\nbest-tasted were said to be found in the river itself. A still finer\r\nkind were in season about autumn in the vicinity of Ephesos. The\r\nechinos, or sea-chestnut,[608] cooked with oxymel, parsley, and mint,\r\nwas esteemed good and wholesome eating. Those caught about Cephalonia,\r\nIcaria, and Achaia were bitterish, those of Sicily laxative; the best\r\nwere the red and the quince coloured. A laughable anecdote is told of a\r\nSpartan, who being invited to dine where sea-chestnuts were brought to\r\ntable, took one upon his plate, and not knowing how they were eaten put\r\nit into his mouth, shell and all. Finding it exceedingly unmanageable,\r\nhe turned it about for some time, seeking slowly and cautiously to\r\ndiscover the knack of eating it. But the rough and prickly shell still\r\nresisting his efforts, his temper grew ruffled: crunching it fiercely he\r\nexclaimed, “Detestable beast! Well! I will not let thee go now, after\r\nhaving thus ground thee to pieces; but assuredly I will never touch thee\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 606:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 30. During their long fasts the modern Greeks also eat the\r\n  cuttle-fish, snails, &c. Chandler, ii. 143.\r\n\r\nFootnote 607:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 35.\r\n\r\nFootnote 608:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 40. The taking of this fish at Sunium is thus described by\r\n  Chandler: “Meanwhile our sailors, except two or three who accompanied\r\n  us, stripped to their drawers to bathe, all of them swimming and\r\n  diving remarkably well; some running about on the sharp rocks with\r\n  their naked feet, as if devoid of feeling, and some examining the\r\n  bottom of the clear water for the Echinus or sea-chestnut, a species\r\n  of shell-fish common on this coast, and now in perfection, the moon\r\n  being nearly at the full.” Vol. ii. p. 8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOysters were esteemed good when boiled with mallows, or monks’\r\nrhubarb.[609] In general, however, the physicians of antiquity\r\nconsidered them hard of digestion. But lest the shelled-fish should\r\nusurp more space than is their due, we shall conclude with Archestratos’\r\nlist, in which he couples with each the name of the place where the best\r\nwere caught:\r\n\r\n           For mussels you must go to Ænos; oysters\r\n           You’ll find best at Abydos. Parion\r\n           Rejoices in its urchins; but if cockles\r\n           Gigantic and sweet-tasted you would eat,\r\n           A voyage must be made to Mitylene,\r\n           Or the Ambracian Gulf, where they abound\r\n           With many other dainties. At Messina,\r\n           Near to the Faro, are pelorian conchs,\r\n           Nor are those bad you find near Ephesos;\r\n           For Tethyan oysters, go to Chalcedon;\r\n           But for the Heralds,[610] may Zeus overwhelm them\r\n           Both in the sea and in the agora!\r\n           Aye, all except my old friend Agathon,\r\n           Who in the midst of Lesbian vineyards dwells.[611]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 609:\r\n\r\n  Demet.

Next in excellence\r\nwere those caught in the river Strymon, and the Faro of Messina.[613]\r\nThe ellops, by some supposed to be the sword-fish,[614] was found in\r\ngreatest perfection near Syracuse; at least, in the opinion of\r\nArchestratos; but Varro and Pliny give the preference to that of Rhodes,\r\nand others to that of the Pamphylian sea.[615] The red mullet, the\r\nhepsetos, the hepatos, the elacaten, the thunny, the hippouros, the\r\nhippos, or sea-horse, found in perfection on the shores[616] of\r\nPhœnicia, the ioulis, the kichlè, or sea-thrush, the sea-boar, the\r\ncitharos, the kordylos, the river cray-fish, the shark, which was eaten\r\nwhen young, the mullet, the coracinos, the carp, the gudgeon, the\r\nsea-cuckoo, the sea-wolf, the latos, the leobatos, or smooth ray, the\r\nlamprey,[617] the myræna, the anchovy,[618] the black tail, the torpedo,\r\nthe mormyros, the orphos, the onos, the polypus, the crab, the\r\nsea-perch, the physa, or sea-tench, the raphis, the sea-dog,[619] the\r\nscaros, the sparos, the scorpios, the salpe, or stock-fish, the synodon,\r\nthe sauros, the scepinos, or halibut, the sciaina, the syagris, the\r\nsphyræna, the sepia, the tœnia, the skate, the cuttle-fish, the hyca,\r\nthe phagros, the perca cabrilla, the chromis, the gilthead, the\r\ntrichidon, the thratta, and the turbot;[620] such is a list of the fish\r\nin common use among the Greeks.

If we may\r\ncredit Epicharmos, a decided preference was given to such as fed on the\r\nolive. Aristotle divides the thrush into three species, the first and\r\nlargest of which he denominates Ixophagos, or the “mistletoe-eater;” it\r\nwas of the size of a magpie. The second, equal in bigness to the black\r\nbird, he calls Trichas,[624] and the third, and smallest kind, which was\r\nnamed Ilas or Tulas, according to Alexander, the Myndian, went in\r\nflocks, and built its nest like the swallow.[625] Next in excellence to\r\nthe thrush was a bird known by a variety of names, elaios, pirias,\r\nsycalis,[626] the beccafico of the moderns, which was thought to be in\r\nseason when the figs were ripe. They likewise ate the turtle and the\r\nringdove,[627] which are excellent in Egypt; the chaffinch, to whose\r\nqualities I cannot bear testimony; and the blackbird. Nor did they spare\r\nthe starling, the jackdaw, or the strouthanion, a small bird for which\r\nmodern languages cannot afford a name. Brains were thought by the\r\nancient philosophers an odious and cannibal-like food, because they are\r\nthe fountain of all sensation; but this did not prevent the gourmands\r\nfrom converting pigs’ brains into a dainty dish,[628] and their taste\r\nhas maintained its ground in Italy. Partridges, wood-pigeons, geese,\r\nquails, jays, are also enumerated among the materials of an Hellenic\r\nbanquet.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 623:\r\n\r\n  The solitary sparrow inhabits the cliffs of Delphi, and the\r\n  song-thrush is heard in the pine woods of Parnassus.

Aristophanes speaks of the pheasant in his comedy of the Birds;\r\nand, again, in the Clouds, Athenæus rightly supposes him to mean this\r\nbird, where others imagine he alludes to the horses of the Phasis.\r\nMnesilochos, a writer of the middle comedy, classes a plucked pheasant\r\nwith _hen’s milk_, among things equally difficult to be met with, which\r\nshows that the bird had not then become common. It obtained its name\r\nfrom being found in immense numbers about the embouchure of the Phasis,\r\nand the bird was evidently propagated very slowly in Greece and Egypt,\r\nsince we find Ptolemy Philadelphos, in a grand public festival at\r\nAlexandria, exhibiting it, among other rarities, such as parroquets,\r\npeacocks, guinea-fowl, and Ethiopian birds in cages.[630]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 629:\r\n\r\n  See the fragment of Eubulos’s Garland-Seller, in Athen. ix. 33.\r\n\r\nFootnote 630:\r\n\r\n  Athen. ix. 38.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAmong the favourite game of the Athenian gourmands was the Attagas,[631]\r\nor francolin, a little larger than the partridge, variegated with\r\nnumerous spots, and of common tile colour, somewhat inclining to red. It\r\nis said to have been introduced from Lydia into Greece, and was found in\r\nextraordinary abundance in the Megaris. Another of their favourites was\r\nthe porphyrion, a bird which might with great advantage be introduced\r\ninto many countries of modern Europe, since it was exceedingly domestic,\r\nand kept strict watch over the married women, whose _faux pas_ it\r\nimmediately detected and revealed to their husbands, after which,\r\nknowing the revengeful spirit of ladies so situated, it very prudently\r\nhung itself. It is no wonder, therefore, that the breed has long been\r\nextinct, or that the remnant surviving has taken refuge in some remote\r\nregion, where wives require no such vigilant guardians. In the matter of\r\neating it agreed exactly with Lord Byron, loving to feast alone, and in\r\nretired nooks, where none could observe. Aristotle describes this half\r\nfabulous bird as unwebfooted, of blue colour, with long legs, and red\r\nbeak. The porphyrion was about the size of a cock, and originally a\r\nnative of Libya, where it was esteemed sacred.[632]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 631:\r\n\r\n  No bird appears to have puzzled commentators more than the _attagas_,\r\n  some supposing it to be the _francolin_, or grouse, which is\r\n  Schneider’s opinion; others, as Passow, the _hazel-hen_; others,\r\n  again, as Ainsworth, consider it to have been a delicious bird,\r\n  resembling our wood-cock, or snipe. Mr. Mitchell’s edit. of the\r\n  Acharnæ of Aristophanes, 783.—This learned writer professes not to\r\n  understand what Schneider means by _francolin_. The word in Italian is\r\n  _francolino_, as appears from Bellon. v. 6: Les Italiens ont nommé cet\r\n  oiseau Francolin, que parcequ’il est franc dans ce pays, c’est-à-dire,\r\n  qu’il est defendu au peuple d’en tuer: il n’y a que les princes qui\r\n  aient cette prérogative.—Valmont de Bomare, ii. 739.—Hardouin thinks,\r\n  that the Attagas is the _gallina rustica_, or _gelinotte de bois_,\r\n  which Laveaux explains to be a sort of partridge.—Cf.

Of the partridge,\r\ncommon throughout Europe, we need merely remark, that both the gray and\r\nthe red (the _bartavelle_ of the French) were common in Greece.\r\n\r\nIf we pass from the poultry to puddings and soups,[633] we shall find\r\nthat the Athenians were not ill-provided with these dainties. They even\r\nconverted gruel into a delicacy,[634] and it is said, that the best was\r\nmade at Megara. They had bean soup, flour soup, ptisans made with\r\npearl-barley or groats.[635] We hear, also, of a delicately-powdered\r\ndish or soup which was sprinkled over with fine flour and olives. The\r\npolphos, evidently _soupe à la julienne_, is said, by some, to have been\r\ncomposed of scraped roots, vegetables, and flour. Others take it to mean\r\na sort of made-dish, resembling macaroni or vermicelli. Another kind of\r\nsoup was the _kidron_, which, according to Pollux,[636] they made of\r\ngreen wheat, roasted and reduced to powder.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 633:\r\n\r\n  Schol. Aristoph.

Julius\r\nPollux[637] has preserved the recipe for making it, and we can assure\r\nour gourmands, that nothing more exquisite was ever tasted, even in the\r\nbest café of the Palais Royal. They took a certain quantity of the\r\nfinest clarified lard, and, mixing it up with milk until it was quite\r\nthick, added an equal portion of new cheese, yolks of eggs, and the\r\nfinest flour. The whole rolled up tight in a fragrant fig-leaf, was then\r\ncooked in chicken-broth, or soup made with kid’s flesh. When they\r\nconsidered it well done, the leaf was removed and the pudding soused in\r\nboiling honey. It was then served up hissing-hot. All the ingredients\r\nwere used in equal proportions, excepting the yolks of eggs, of which\r\nthere was somewhat more than of anything else, in order to give firmness\r\nand consistency to the whole.[638]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 637:\r\n\r\n  Onomast. i. 237. vi. 57, 69.\r\n\r\nFootnote 638:\r\n\r\n  Vid.

Lupines, pomegranates,\r\nhorse-radish, the dregs of grapes and olives, all of which entered into\r\nthe material of an Attic entertainment, were commonly cried about the\r\nstreets of Athens.[644] But these edible lupines, (θέρμοι) still eaten\r\nby the Egyptian peasantry and the poor generally throughout the Levant,\r\nmust be distinguished from the common species. An anecdote of Zeno, of\r\nCittion, will illustrate the character of this kind of pulse, with which\r\nthe philosopher was evidently familiar. Being one day asked why, though\r\nnaturally morose, he became quite affable when half-seas-over: “I am\r\nlike the lupine,” he replied, “which, when dry, is very bitter, but\r\nperfectly sweet and agreeable after it has been well soaked.”[645]\r\nKidney-beans, too, were in much request, and pickled olives, slightly\r\nflavoured with fennel.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 643:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

And the seeds of the ground-pine,[647] still eaten as\r\na dessert in Italy, entered, in Greece, also into the list of edible\r\nfruits.[648] The tree, I am informed, has been introduced into England,\r\nbut I have nowhere seen its fruit brought among pears, walnuts, and\r\napples, to table. Hen’s milk has already been spoken of among the good\r\nthings of Hellas;[649] but lest the reader should suspect us of amusing\r\nhim with fables, it should be explained, that the white of an egg was so\r\ncalled by Anaxagoras.[650] Eggs of all kinds were much esteemed.\r\nSometimes they were boiled hard, and cut in two with a hair; but, many\r\nwriters, confounding ὄα, the berries of the service-tree, with ὠὰ, eggs,\r\nhave imagined that the Athenians, in the capriciousness of their\r\nculinary taste, actually ate pickled eggs, an idea which stirs to the\r\nbottom the erudite bile of David Ruhnken.[651] Generally, eggs were\r\neaten soft, as with us, or swallowed quite raw. Those of the pea-hen\r\nwere considered the most delicate; next to these, the eggs of the\r\nchenalopex bergander, or Egyptian goose, and, lastly, those of the hen.\r\nThis, at least, is the opinion of Epicrates and Heracleides, of\r\nSyracuse, in their treatises on cookery.[652]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 646:\r\n\r\n  Hesiod.

The melons of Greece are still delicious, and famous as ever\r\nin the Levant. Antioch was celebrated for its cucumbers, Smyrna for its\r\nlettuces.

Besides being used in seasoning soups and sauces, and\r\nmixed with salt for giving a superior flavour to meat, its juice\r\noccupied a high place among the materia medica.[661] A single plant was\r\ndiscovered in the reign of Nero, and sent to Rome as a present to the\r\nEmperor. Its seed, according to Pollux,[662] was called magudaris, its\r\nroot silphion, the stem caulos, and the leaf maspeton.

Athen. ii. 64.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWe come now to the fruit,[664] and shall begin with that which was the\r\npride of Attica, the fig.[665] According to traditions fully credited in\r\nAthens, figs were first produced on a spot near the city, on the road to\r\nEleusis, thence called _Hiera Sukè_, “the sacred fig-tree.”[666] Like\r\nits men, the figs of Attica were esteemed the best in the world, and to\r\nsecure an abundant supply for the use of the inhabitants it was\r\nforbidden to export them. As might have been expected, however, this\r\ndecree was habitually contravened, and the informers against the\r\ndelinquents were called sycophants, that is, “revealers of figs,”[667] a\r\nword which has been adopted by most modern languages to signify\r\nmean-souled, dastardly persons, such as informers always are. The\r\nfig-tree of Laconia was a dwarfed species, and its fruit, according to\r\nAristophanes,[668] savoured of hatred and tyranny, like the people\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n                      There is no kind of fig,\r\n                      Whether little or big,\r\n              Save the Spartan, which here does not grow;\r\n                      But this, though quite small,\r\n                      Swells with hatred and gall,\r\n              A stern foe to the Demos, I trow.[669]\r\n\r\nAristophanes, in Athenæus, speaking of fruit, couples myrtle-berries\r\nwith Phibaleian figs.[670]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 664:\r\n\r\n  Plat.

Sosibios, the\r\nLaconian, attributing the discovery of the fig to Bacchos, observes,\r\nthat for this reason the god was, at Sparta, worshiped under the name of\r\n_Sukites_. Andriscos, however, and Agasthenes, relate that this divinity\r\nobtained the name of Meilichios, “the gracious,” among the Naxians\r\nbecause he taught them the use of figs. To eat figs at noon was regarded\r\nas unwholesome; and they were at all times supposed to be highly\r\nprejudicial to the voice, for which reason singers should carefully\r\neschew them.[671]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 671:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 19.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe apples of Delphi enjoyed great celebrity, and probably, therefore,\r\nwere mild, since these were thought superior, or at least more\r\nwholesome, than sharp ones. Quinces they esteemed still more salubrious\r\nthan apples, and, during certain public rejoicings, this fruit, handfuls\r\nof myrtle-leaves, crowns of roses and violets, were cast before the cars\r\nof their princes and other great men.[672] The Greeks loved to connect\r\nsomething of the marvellous with whatever they admired. To the quince\r\nthey attributed the honour of being a powerful antidote, observing that\r\neven the Phariac poison, though of extremely rapid operation, lost its\r\nvirulence if poured into any vessel which had held quinces and retained\r\ntheir odour.[673] According to Hermon, in his Cretic Glossaries, the\r\nquince was called Kodumala, in Crete. Sidoüs, a village of Corinthia,\r\nwas famous for its fine apples; and even Corinth itself, the “windy\r\nEphyrè” of Homer, produced them in great perfection.\r\n\r\n      “O where is the maiden, sweeter far\r\n      Than the ruddy fruits of Ephyrè are?\r\n      When the winds of summer have o’er them blown,\r\n      And their cheeks with autumn’s gold have been strown!”[674]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 672:\r\n\r\n  Stesich. ap.

This is the fruit\r\nwhich, according to King Juba, was called in Africa “the apple of the\r\nHesperides,” a name bestowed by Timachidas on a rich and fragrant kind\r\nof pear called _epimelis_. The oldest Greek writer who has described the\r\ncitron tree is Theophrastus,[676] who says it was found in Persia and\r\nMedia. Its leaf, he observes, resembled that of the laurel, the\r\nstrawberry tree, or the walnut. Like the wild pear tree, and the\r\noxyacanthos, it has sharp, smooth, and very strong prickles. The fruit\r\nis not eaten, but together with the leaves exhales a sweet odour, and\r\nlaid with cloths in coffers protects them from the moth. The citron\r\ntree, is always covered with fruit, some ripe and fit to be gathered,\r\nothers green, with patches of gold; and, in the midst of these, are\r\nother branches covered thick with blossoms. It now forms the fairest\r\nornaments of the gardens of Heliopolis, where it shades the Fountain of\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 675:\r\n\r\n  Vict. Var.

An opinion, it\r\nseems, prevailed in Egypt, that a citron eaten the first thing in the\r\nmorning was an antidote against all kinds of poison, whether taken into\r\nthe stomach, or introduced by puncture into the blood, and the notion\r\narose out of the following circumstance. A governor of Egypt, in the\r\ntime of the Emperors, had condemned two criminals to be executed, in\r\nobedience to custom, by the bite of an asp. They were, accordingly, led\r\nin the morning towards the place of execution, and on the way the\r\nlandlady of an inn, who happened to be eating citrons, compassionating\r\ntheir condition, gave them some which they ate. Shortly afterwards they\r\nwere exposed to the hungry serpents, which immediately bit them, but\r\ninstead of exhibiting the usual symptoms followed by death, they\r\nremained uninjured. At this the governor marvelled much, and at length\r\ndemanded of the soldier who guarded them, whether they had taken\r\nanything previously to their arrival. Learning what had happened he put\r\noff the execution to the following day, and ordering a citron to be\r\ngiven to one and not to the other, they were once more exposed to the\r\nbite of the asp. The wretch who had eaten nothing died soon after he was\r\nbitten, but the other experienced no inconvenience. Similar experiments\r\nwere several times afterwards made by others, until it was at length\r\nascertained that this exquisite fruit is really an antidote against\r\npoisons.[678]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 678:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 28.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnother fruit of which great use was made, was the damascene plum,\r\nsometimes confounded with the brabylon. The cherry,[679] introduced into\r\nItaly by Lucullus, was known to the Greeks[680] at a much earlier\r\nperiod, and is described by Theophrastus. The wild service berry,[681]\r\nthe dwarf cherry, the arbutus fruit, and the mulberry, formed part of\r\ntheir dessert. Even the blackberry, when perfectly ripe, was not\r\ndisdained.[682] In fact, both the mulberry and blackberry were esteemed\r\na preventive of gout, and an ancient writer relates, that this kind of\r\nfruit having failed during a period of twenty years, that disease\r\nprevailed like an epidemic, attacking persons of both sexes and all\r\nages, and extending its ravages even to the sheep and cattle.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 679:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

Of almonds, the island of Naxos had the\r\nreputation of producing very excellent ones, and those of Cypros also\r\nenjoyed considerable reputation. These latter were longer in form than\r\nthe former; like pickled olives they were eaten at the commencement of a\r\nrepast, for the purpose of producing thirst; and bitter almonds were\r\nconsidered a preservative against intoxication, as we learn from an\r\nanecdote of Tiberius’s physician, who could encounter three bottles when\r\nthus fortified, but easily succumbed if deprived of his almonds. This\r\nfruit being extremely common in Greece, they had their almond-crackers,\r\nas we have our nut-crackers, which at Sparta were called _moucerobatos_\r\nbut _amygdalocatactes_ in the rest of Greece.[684]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 683:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

There was, likewise, a sort of\r\nchestnut imported from Persia, and another from the neighbourhood of\r\nSardes, in Lydia. Both these and the walnut were considered\r\nindigestible; but not so the almond, of which it was thought great\r\nquantities might be eaten with impunity.[685] The best kinds were\r\nproduced in Thasos and Cypros, and, when freshly gathered, the almonds\r\nof the south are, undoubtedly, of all fruit, the most delicate. The\r\nwalnuts and chestnuts of Eubœa, in the opinion of Mnestheos, were\r\ndifficult of digestion, but fattening; and no one can have frequented\r\nthe eastern shores of the Mediterranean without observing what an\r\nimportant article of food, and how nourishing, they are.[686] The\r\npistachio nut, produced from a tree resembling the almond-tree, was\r\nimported from Syria and Arabia.[687] The _persea_, now no longer known,\r\nbut supposed to be represented on the walls of the Memnonium,[688] at\r\nThebes, is, also, said, by Poseidonios, the stoic, to have grown in\r\nArabia and Syria, and I brought home a quantity of leaves, preserved in\r\nan Egyptian coffin, which are, probably, those of this tree. Pears,\r\nwhich were brought to table floating in water,[689] and service-berries,\r\nwere grown in great perfection in the island of Ceos, and Bœotia was\r\nfamous for its pomegranates.[690]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 685:\r\n\r\n  Dioscorid. i. 176.

They were also\r\ndried, as they still are in the East, to be eaten as a dessert, at other\r\nseasons of the year. From which we learn, that the black date, which is\r\nlarger and finer than the yellow, was not then cultivated in Persia. But\r\nneither dates, nor any other fruit, could compare with the grape, which\r\nis found in perfection in almost every part of Greece, where, as in\r\nBurgundy and, I presume, in the rest of France, the law regulated the\r\nperiod of the vintage, prohibiting individuals from gathering their\r\ngrapes earlier under a heavy penalty.[694] The best kind of grape in\r\nAttica, like that of the _Clos Vougeot_ in Burgundy, was the\r\n_Nikostrateios_, supposed to be unrivalled for excellence, though the\r\nRhodians pretended, in their _Hipponion_, to possess its equal.[695]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 692:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

It will not, therefore, be expected that we\r\nshould enter into very minute details; though, if we are sparing, it\r\nwill certainly not be for want of materials. D’Herbelot[696] relates an\r\noriental tradition which attributes the invention of wine to the ancient\r\nPersian monarch Giamshid; and Bochart, with some show of ingenuity,\r\nattributes to Bacchos, the Grecian inventor and god of wine, an origin\r\nwhich would confound him with the founder of Babylon.[697] A very\r\ncelebrated wine, called _nectar_, is said to have been produced in the\r\nneighbourhood of that city.[698] But, according to Theopompos, it was\r\nthe inhabitants of Chios who first planted and cultivated the vine, and\r\nfrom them the knowledge was transmitted to the other Greeks.[699]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 696:\r\n\r\n  Biliothèque Orientale, Article Giamschid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 697:\r\n\r\n  Geog.

The comic poets are eloquent in\r\npraise of the wines of Thasos, particularly of that mixed sort, of most\r\nagreeable flavour, which was drunk in their Prytaneion.\r\nTheophrastus[705] gives the recipe for making it. They threw, he says,\r\ninto the jars, a small quantity of flour kneaded with honey, the latter\r\nto impart a sweet odour to the wine, the former mildness. A similar\r\neffect was produced by mixing up hard inodorous wine with one which was\r\noily and fragrant.[706]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 700:\r\n\r\n  Hist. Plant. ix. 18. 10, seq.

The Mareotic wine[707] was made\r\nfrom vineyards on the banks of the lake Mareotis, where the present\r\nPasha has his gardens, in the vicinity of Marea, once a place of\r\nconsiderable importance, but now a small village. Attempts, however,\r\nhave been made by M. Abro, an Armenian, once more to cover the ancient\r\nsites with vineyards, several acres of ground being planted with\r\ncuttings imported from the great nursery grounds at Chambéry, in Savoy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 707:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 59.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe town of Marea derived its name, according to tradition, from\r\nMaron,[708] a person who accompanied Bacchos in his military expedition,\r\nand, in honour of its founder, surrounded itself with the fruit-tree\r\nmost agreeable to that god. The grapes here produced were delicious, and\r\nthe wine, slightly astringent and aromatic, had an exquisite flavour.\r\nThe Mareotic was white, of delicate taste, light, sparkling, and by no\r\nmeans heady. The best sort was the Tæniotic, so called from the _tænia_,\r\n“sandy eminences,” on which the vineyards were situated. This wine, in\r\nits pure state, had a greenish tinge, like the Johanisberg, and was rich\r\nand unctuous; but, mingled with water, it assumed the colour of Attic\r\nhoney. By degrees the vine grew to be cultivated along the whole course\r\nof the Nile,[709] but its produce differed greatly in different places,\r\nboth in colour and quality. Among the best was that of Antylla, a city\r\nnear Alexandria, the revenues arising from which the ancient kings of\r\nEgypt, and afterwards those of Persia, settled on their queens for their\r\ngirdle. The wines of the Thebaid, particularly those made about Koptos,\r\nwere so extremely light as to be given even in fevers, as, moreover,\r\nthey passed quickly, and greatly promoted digestion.[710]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 708:\r\n\r\n  Idem, i. 60.

Diphilos,[711]\r\nthe comic poet, gives us, however, something better than etymologies in\r\nthat burst of Bacchic enthusiasm in which, in verses fragrant as\r\nBurgundy, he celebrates the praises of the gift of Dionysos:\r\n\r\n       “Oh! friend to the wise, to the children of song,\r\n       Take me with thee, thou wisest and sweetest, along;\r\n       To the humble, the lowly, proud thoughts dost thou bring,\r\n       For the wretch who has thee is as blythe as a king:\r\n       From the brows of the sage, in thy humorous play,\r\n       Thou dost smooth every furrow, every wrinkle away;\r\n       To the weak thou giv’st strength, to the mendicant gold,\r\n       And a slave warmed by thee as a lion is bold.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 711:\r\n\r\n  Idem, ii. 1, where are collected many other etymologies and curious\r\n  fables.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNectar, the poetical drink of the gods, was a sort of wine made near\r\nOlympos in Lydia, by mingling with the juice of the grape a little pure\r\nhoney and flowers of delicate fragrance. Anaxandrides, indeed, regards\r\nthe nectar as the food of the immortals, and ambrosia as their wine; in\r\nwhich opinion he is upheld by Alcman and Sappho. But Homer and Ibycos\r\ntake an opposite view of the matter.[712]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 712:\r\n\r\n  Athen. ii. 8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAlexis speaks of those who are half-seas-over as much addicted to\r\nreasoning. Nicænetus[713] considers wine as the Pegasus of a poet,\r\nmounted on the wings of which like Trygæos on his beetle he soars “to\r\nthe bright heaven of invention.” At the port of Munychia, too, good wine\r\nwas held in high estimation; indeed, the honest folks of this borough,\r\nwith small respect for the water nymphs, paid particular honour to the\r\nhero _Acratopotes_, that is, in plain English, “one who drinks unmixed\r\nwine.” Even among the Spartans,[714] in spite of their cothons, and\r\nblack broth, certain culinary artistes set up in the Phydition, or\r\ncommon dining-hall, statues in honour of the heroes _Matton_ and\r\n_Keraon_, that is, the genii of eating and drinking. In Achaia, too,\r\nmuch reverence was paid to _Deipneus_, or the god who presides over good\r\nsuppers.[715]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 713:\r\n\r\n  Or Nicarchos. Anthol. Græc. xiii. 29.

They had, accordingly, fig wine,[716] root wine, palm wine, and\r\nso on; and their made or mixed wines were without number. There was\r\nscarcely an island or city in the Mediterranean that did not export its\r\nwines to Athens: they had the Lesbian, the Eubœan, the Peparethian,\r\nthe Chalybonian, the Thasian, the Pramnian, and the Port wine. We have\r\nalready observed, that wine was drunk mixed with flour,[717] and in the\r\nisland of Theræ it was thickened with the yolk of an egg. In the Megaris\r\nthey prepared with raisins or dried grapes[718] a wine called _passon_,\r\nin taste resembling the Ægosthenic sweet wine, or the Cretan malmsey.\r\nBut, however exquisite the wines themselves, it was not thought enough\r\nin the summer months unless they were brought to table cooled with ice\r\nor snow,[719] which was accordingly the practice.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 716:\r\n\r\n  Damm. 2224. βρύτον.

Locke, with many\r\nother modern philosophers, erroneously supposes the Greeks of remote\r\nantiquity to have been so abstemious as to content themselves with one\r\nmeal per diem. But experience appears to have led all mankind on this\r\npoint to much the same conclusion; viz., that health and comfort require\r\nmen to eat at least thrice in the day,[720] which accordingly was the\r\npractice of the ancient Greeks, though Philemon and others enumerate\r\nfour repasts. Our own ancestors, before the introduction of tea and\r\ncoffee, appear to have been very well content with beer or ale for their\r\nmorning’s meal, so that we could not pity the Greeks even though it\r\nshould be found that they had nothing better[721] than hot rolls,\r\nmuffins, or crumpets, with strawberries, grapes, pears, and a flask of\r\nChian or Falernian. But they soon found the necessity of some warm\r\nbeverage; and though it does not appear how it was prepared, they had a\r\nsubstitute for tea,[722] in use at Athens, in Eubœa, in Crete, and, no\r\ndoubt, in all other parts of Greece. This meal, of whatever it\r\nconsisted, was called _acratisma_, or _ariston_, and eaten at break of\r\nday.[723] Homer’s heroes, whose business was fighting, just snatched a\r\nhasty meal, and hurried to the field; but at Athens, where people had\r\nother employments, they breakfasted early, to allow themselves ample\r\ntime for despatching their affairs in the city, if they had any, and\r\nafterwards at their neighbouring farms or villas.[724] The second\r\nrepast, _deipnon_, or dinner, seems to have been eaten about eleven or\r\ntwelve o’clock: the _hesperisma_,[725] equivalent to our tea, late in\r\nthe afternoon, and the _dorpon_, or supper, the last thing in the\r\nevening. But of these meals two only were serious affairs, and the\r\n_hesperisma_ was often dispensed with altogether. In fact, Athenæus, a\r\ngreat authority on this subject, considers it perfectly absurd to\r\nsuppose, that the frugal ancients could have thought of eating so often\r\nas three times in one day.[726]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 720:\r\n\r\n  Æschyl.

The last, so far as it had any peculiar\r\nfeatures, has been described among the circumstances attending\r\nmatrimony. We have, therefore, for the present, to do with two only;\r\nand, as the Greek contrived to throw much of his ingenuity into all\r\nmatters connected with feasting and merry-making, the discussion of this\r\npart of our subject should savour strongly of mirth and jollity.\r\n\r\nThe grand dinner,[727] which they called _eilapinè_, was generally given\r\nat the expense of an individual, and its sumptuousness knew no limit but\r\nthe means of the host. Other kinds of feasts there were at which all the\r\nmembers of a tribe, a borough, or a fraternity, were entertained, not to\r\nspeak for the present of the common tables of the Cretans, Spartans, or\r\nPrytanes of Athens. We now confine ourselves to those jovial assemblages\r\nof private citizens whose object in meeting was not so much the dinner,\r\nthough that was not overlooked, as the elevation of animal spirits and\r\nflow of soul produced by the union of a thousand different\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 727:\r\n\r\n  On the subject of dining see Pollux, vi. 9, seq. with the notes of\r\n  Jungermann, Kuhn, Hemsterhuis. &c.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen a rich man desired to see his friends around him at his board, he\r\ndelivered to his _deipnocletor_[728] a domestic kept for this purpose, a\r\ntablet, or as we should say, a card, whereon the names of the persons to\r\nbe invited, with the day and hour fixed upon for the banquet, were\r\ninscribed. With brothers and other very near relations this ceremony was\r\nthought unnecessary.[729] They came without invitation. So likewise did\r\nanother class of men, who, living at large upon the public and lighting\r\nunbidden upon any sport to which they were attracted by the savour of a\r\ngood dinner, were denominated[730] FLIES, and occasionally SHADES or\r\nPARASITES. There was at one time a law at Athens, which a good deal\r\nnonplussed these gentlemen. It was decreed, that not more than thirty\r\npersons should meet at a marriage feast, and a wealthy citizen, desirous\r\nof “going the whole hog,” had invited the full complement. An honest\r\nFly, however, who respected no law that interfered with his stomach,\r\ncontrived to introduce himself, and took his station at the lower end of\r\nthe table. Presently the magistrate appointed for the purpose, entered,\r\nand espying his man at a glance, began counting the guests, commencing\r\non the other side and ending with the parasite. “Friend,” said he, “you\r\nmust retire. I find there is one person more than the law allows.” “It\r\nis quite a mistake, sir,” replied the Fly, “as you will find if you will\r\nhave the goodness to count again, beginning _on this side_.”[731] Among\r\nthe Egyptians, who shrouded all their poetry in hieroglyphics, _a fly_\r\nwas the emblem of impudence, which necessarily formed the principal\r\nqualification of a Parasite, and in Hume’s[732] opinion is no bad\r\npossession to any man who would make his way in the world.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 728:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iv. 70.

In the street they\r\n  would say to the person they met, “Stand aside, friend, and allow this\r\n  gentleman to pass!” They would bring apples and pears in their pocket\r\n  for his little ones and be sure to give them in his sight, with great\r\n  praise both of father and children.\r\n\r\nFootnote 731:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 45, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 732:\r\n\r\n  Nothing, says this philosopher, carries a man through the world like a\r\n  true genuine natural impudence. Essays, p. 9, quarto.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nArchbishop Potter,[733] in his account of Grecian entertainments,\r\nobserves, upon the authority of Cicero and Cornelius Nepos, that women\r\nwere never invited with the men.[734] But in this, as has been shown in\r\nthe proper place, he was misled by those learned Romans; for, in many\r\ncities and colonies of Greece, no banquet was given at which they were\r\nnot present. Even at Athens, where women of character thought it\r\nunbecoming to mingle in the convivial revelries of the men,[735] in\r\nwhich wine constantly overleaps the boundaries of decorum, their place\r\nwas supplied by hetairæ, whose polished manners, ready wit, and enlarged\r\nand enlightened understandings, recommended them to their companions,\r\nand caused the laxity of their morals to be forgotten.[736] To proceed,\r\nhowever, with our feast: it will readily be supposed, that gentlemen\r\ninvited out to dinner were careful to apparel themselves elegantly, to\r\nshave clean, and arrange their beards and moustachios after the most\r\napproved fashion of the day. Even Socrates, who cared as little as most\r\npeople for external appearances, bathed, put on a pair of new shoes,\r\nbrushed his chlamys, and otherwise spruced himself up when going to sup\r\nat Agathon’s with Phædros, Aristophanes, Eryximachos, and other\r\nexquisites. Even in Homeric times the bath was among the preliminaries\r\nto dinner, and guests arriving from a distance were attended through all\r\nthe operations of the toilette by female slaves.[737] But this general\r\nablution was not considered sufficient. On sitting down to table water\r\nwas again presented to every guest in silver[738] lavers or ewers of\r\ngold. And since they ate with their fingers, as still is the practice in\r\nthe Levant, it was moreover customary to wash the hands between every\r\ncourse,[739] and wipe them,[740] in remoter ages, with soft bread, which\r\nwas thrown to the dogs, and in aftertimes with napkins. The Arcadians,\r\nhowever, about whose mountains all the old superstitions of Hellas clung\r\nlike bats, found a very different use for the cakes with which they\r\nwiped their fingers. They supposed them to acquire some mystic powers by\r\nthe operation, and preserved them as a charm against ghosts.[741]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 733:\r\n\r\n  Antiq. iv. 19.\r\n\r\nFootnote 734:\r\n\r\n  Plato giving directions for a marriage feast, observes, that five male\r\n  and five female friends should be invited; along with these, five male\r\n  and five female relations, who with the bride and bridegroom, with\r\n  their parents, grandfathers, &c., would amount to 28.

That among the more simple and\r\n  old-fashioned citizens of Athens, however, men and women, when of the\r\n  same family or clan, dined together, we have the testimony of Menander\r\n  to prove. He introduces one of his characters, apparently a fop,\r\n  observing that it was a bore to be at a family party, where the\r\n  father, holding the goblet in his hand, first made a speech, abounding\r\n  with exhortations: the mother followed, and then the grandmother\r\n  prated a little. Afterwards stood up her father, hoarse with age, and\r\n  his wife, calling him her dearest; while he mean time nodded to all\r\n  present.

To return then.\r\nImmediately on entering, and when the host had welcomed and shaken hands\r\nwith all, such gentlemen as possessed beards[742] had them perfumed over\r\nburning censers of frankincense, as ladies have their tresses on\r\nvisiting a Turkish harem. The hands, too, after each lavation, were\r\nscented.[743] Before sitting down to table, and while the cooks were\r\npeppering the soup, frying the fish, or giving the roast-meat another\r\nturn, politeness required the guests to take a stroll[744] in the\r\npicture-gallery and admire the exquisite taste of their entertainer in\r\narticles of _virtu_.[745] Here while the scent of the savoury viands\r\nfound its way through every apartment, and set the bowels of the hungry\r\nparasites croaking, the rogues who had lunched well at home leisurely\r\ndiscussed the merits of Zeuxis or Parrhasios, of Pheidias or Polygnotos,\r\nor opened wide their eyes at the microscopic creations of that Spartan\r\nartist whose chisel produced a chariot and four that could be hidden\r\nunder the wing of a fly. At length, however, the connoisseurs were\r\ninterrupted in their learned disquisitions by the entrance of Xanthos,\r\nDavos, or Lydos, with the welcome intelligence that dinner was on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 742:\r\n\r\n  Hom.

Sweet gums were burned in the\r\n  middle of the room to scent the air, or scattered on coals before us\r\n  while sitting on the sofa, to perfume our moustachios and garments,\r\n  and at the door, at our departure, we were sprinkled with rose-water.”\r\n  Chandler, ii. 150.\r\n\r\nFootnote 743:\r\n\r\n  Athen. ix. 77.\r\n\r\nFootnote 744:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Consult likewise the\r\n  note on Aristophanes in Bekker’s edition, t. iii. p. 606.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut the appetites of the gourmands had still to encounter another\r\ntrial.[746] The Greeks were above all things a pious people, and\r\nregarded every banquet, nay, every meal, in the light of a sacrifice, at\r\nwhich the first and best portion should be offered as an oblation to the\r\ngods,[747] with invocations and prayer, after which it was considered\r\nlawful to attend to their own appetites. An altar, accordingly, of Zeus\r\nstood in the midst of every dining-room, on which these ceremonies were\r\nperformed, and libations of pure wine poured.[748] This done, the guests\r\ntook their places, in the earlier ages on chairs, but afterwards, when\r\nthey had become familiar with the East, on rich sofas, arranged round\r\nthe board.[749] Occasionally, however, even so late as the age of\r\nAlexander,[750] princes and other great men chose to adopt the ancient\r\ncustom, and, on one occasion, that conqueror himself entertained four\r\nhundred of his officers, when seats of wrought silver, covered with\r\npurple carpets, were provided for all.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 746:\r\n\r\n  Athen. v. 7.

These persons were called ἐδέατροι and προτένθαι. Athen.\r\n  iv. 71.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe manner of reclining on the divans was not a little ludicrous. For,\r\nat the outset, while the appetite was keen, they stretched themselves\r\nflat upon their stomachs, in order, I presume, to command the use of\r\nboth hands, and putting forward their mouths towards the table looked\r\nlike so many sparrows with their open bills projecting over the nest.\r\nBut this they could conveniently do only when they had a large space to\r\nthemselves. When packed close, as usually they were, one man, the chief\r\nin dignity, throwing off his shoes,[751] placed himself on the upper end\r\nof the divan, that is, next the host, reclining on one elbow supported\r\nby soft cushions. The head of the next man reached nearly to his\r\nbreast,—whence in Scripture, the beloved disciple is said to recline on\r\nthe bosom of Christ,[752]—while the feet of the first extended down\r\nbehind him. The third guest occupied the same position with respect to\r\nthe second, and so on until five individuals sometimes crowded each\r\nother on the same sofa.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 751:\r\n\r\n  Schol. Aristoph. Eq. 825.\r\n\r\nFootnote 752:\r\n\r\n  John, xiii. 23. On the cushions, of which there was a great variety,\r\n  see Pollux, vi. 9, where he reckons among them the ὑπηρέσιον, which\r\n  Mitford confounds with the ἄσκωμα, or leathern bags which closed the\r\n  row-port of war-galleys round the oar, to prevent the influx of\r\n  sea-water.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs the heaven of the poets was but a colossal picture of earth, we may,\r\nfrom the practice of the gods, infer what took place among mortals, even\r\nwhere supported by no direct testimony. Now, in Homer, we find gods and\r\ngoddesses mingling freely together at the feast. Zeus takes the head of\r\nthe table, next him sits his daughter Athena, while the imperial Hera,\r\nas Queen of Heaven, takes precedence of all the she Olympians, by\r\nplacing herself at the head of the secondary divinities, directly\r\nopposite her husband. On one occasion we find Athena, the type of\r\nhospitality and politeness, yielding up her seat of honour to Thetis,\r\nbecause, as an Oceanid, she was somewhat of a stranger in Olympos.[753]\r\nPotter has discussed, with more learning than perspicuity, the question\r\nof precedence at table. To render the matter perfectly intelligible\r\nwould require a plan of the dining-room; but wanting this, it may be\r\nobserved, that in Persia the king, or host of whatever rank, sat in the\r\nmiddle, while the guests ranged themselves equally on both sides of him.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 753:\r\n\r\n  Iliad, ω. 100.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn Greece, the bottom of the table was the end next the door. Here no\r\none sat, it being left open for the servants to bring in and remove the\r\ndishes. From this point, on either side, the seats augmented in value,\r\nand consequently the post of greatest honour was the middle of the other\r\nextremity.[754] There were those, however, who made no account of these\r\nmatters, but suffered their guests to seat themselves as they pleased.\r\nThis was the case with Timon, who, having invited a very miscellaneous\r\nparty, would not be at the pains to settle the question of precedence\r\nbetween them; but a pompous individual of aristocratic pretensions,\r\ndressed like an actor, arriving late with a large retinue, and surveying\r\nthe company from the door, went away again, observing, there was no fit\r\nplace left for him. Upon which the guests, who, as Plutarch remarks,\r\nwere far gone in their cups, burst into shouts of laughter, and bade him\r\nmake the best of his way home.[755]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 754:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Plut. Conv. Quæst. i. 3. Pet. Ciacon, De Triclin. p. 44.\r\n\r\nFootnote 755:\r\n\r\n  Sympos. i. 2. 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSome persons observed a very different order in arranging their guests,\r\ngrouping those together whom they considered suited by age or temper to\r\neach other, in order by this contrivance to produce general harmony,—the\r\nvehement and impetuous being placed beside the meek and gentle, the\r\nsilent beside the talkative, the ripe and full and expansive minds\r\nbeside those who were ready to receive instruction. But very often, as\r\nat Agathon’s, those sat next each other, who were most intimately\r\nacquainted or united together by friendship; for thus the greatest\r\nfreedom of intercourse with the brightest sallies of convivial wit were\r\nlikely to be produced.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, we must imagine the guests in their places and every\r\nthing in proper train. The servants bring in first one well-covered\r\ntable, then a second, then a third, till the whole room is filled with\r\ndainties. Brilliant lamps and chandeliers poured a flood of light over\r\nthe crowned heads of the guests, over the piled sweetmeats, over the\r\nshining dishes, and all the baits with which the appetite is caught.\r\nThen, on silver pateræ, cakes whiter than snow were served round. To\r\nthese succeeded eggs, pungent herbs, oysters, and thrushes.[756] Next\r\nseveral dishes of rich eels, brown and crisp, sprinkled thickly with\r\nsalt, followed by a delicious conger dressed with every rare device of\r\ncookery, calculated to delight the palate of the gods. Then came the\r\nbelly of a large ray, round as a hoop; dishes, containing, one some\r\nslices of a sea-dog, another garnished with a sparos, a third with a\r\ncuttle-fish, or smoking polypus whose legs were tender as a chicken.\r\nWhile the sight of these dainties was feasting the eyes of the guests,\r\nthe noses of the experienced informed them of the approach of a\r\nsynodon,[757] which perfumed the passages all the way from the kitchen,\r\nand, flanked with calamaries, covered the whole table. Shrimps too were\r\nthere in their yellow cuirasses, sweet in flavour as honey, with\r\ndelicious varieties of puff pastry bordered with fresh green\r\nfoliage.[758] The teeth of the parasites watered at the sight. But while\r\ndeeply engaged in the discussion of these good things, in came some\r\nsmoking slices of broiled thunny, a mullet fresh from the fish-kettle,\r\nwith the teats of a young sow cooked _en ragoût_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 756:\r\n\r\n  Probably also the myttotos, a dish flavoured with garlic and rich\r\n  spices, formed a part of this course. Schol. Aristoph. Acharn. 173.\r\n  Vesp. 62.\r\n\r\nFootnote 757:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 8. vii. 46. 68. 119. Arist. Hist. Anim. v. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 758:\r\n\r\n  Pollux, vi. 77.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPleasure of all kinds being supposed to promote digestion, female\r\nsingers, flute-players and dancers, were meanwhile exercising their\r\nseveral arts for the entertainment of the guests. But as they paid very\r\nlittle attention to them till the rage of hunger was appeased, we shall\r\nimitate their example, and proceed with the gourmandize. One of the\r\ngreatest accomplishments a boon companion could possess, was the power\r\nto seize with the fingers, and swallow hissing-hot, slices of grilled\r\nfish or morsels of lamb or veal broiled like kabobs, so as to be\r\nslightly burnt and cracking externally, while all the juice and flavour\r\nof the meat remained within. And the acquirement being highly important,\r\ngreat pains were taken to become masters of it. For this purpose some\r\naccustomed themselves daily to play with hot pokers, others\r\ncase-hardened their fingers by repeatedly dipping them in water as hot\r\nas they could bear, and gargled their throats with the same, while one\r\nfamous gourmand, more inventive than the rest, hit upon the ingenious\r\ndevice of wearing metallic fingerlings with which he could have seized a\r\nkabob even from the gridiron. These proficients in the art of eating, an\r\nart practised indeed by all, but possessed in perfection by very few,\r\nenjoyed great advantages over the ignorant and uninitiated. And\r\naccordingly, when invited out, they generally succeeded in bribing the\r\ncook to send in all his dishes hot as Phlegethon, that, while the more\r\nmodest and inexperienced guests sat gazing on, they might secure the\r\nbest cuts, and come again before the others could venture on a mouthful.\r\n\r\nAmong the articles served up in this scorching state were calf’s pluck,\r\npig’s harslet, with the chine, the kidneys, and a variety of small\r\nhors-d’œuvre. To these may be added the head of a sucking-kid which had\r\ntasted nothing but milk, baked between two dishes well luted together;\r\ngiblets boiled; small, delicate hams with their white sward unbroken;\r\npigs’ snouts and feet swimming in white sauce, which the gourmand\r\nPhiloxenos thought a rare invention. Roast kid and lamb’s chitterlings,\r\nor the same viands boiled, formed a supplement to the dishes above\r\nenumerated, and were usually done so exactly to a turn, that even the\r\ngods, Bacchos for example, and Hermes, the parasites of Olympos, might\r\nhave descended expressly to wag their beards over them. But the\r\nLevantines have always been enamoured of variety in cookery. Lady\r\nWortley Montague counted fifty dishes served up in succession at the\r\nSultana Hafiten’s table; and this she-barbarian, with all her wealth,\r\ncould never rival the variety of invention of an ancient Eleian or\r\nSicilian cook, who usually closed the list of his dainties with hare,\r\nchickens roasted to the gold-colour celebrated by Aristophanes,\r\npartridges, pheasants, wood-pigeons or turtle-doves, which your true\r\ngourmand should eat in the Thebaid, immediately after the close of\r\nharvest. But the dinner was not yet over. There still remained the\r\ndessert to be disposed of, consisting of pure honey from the district of\r\nthe silver mines, curdled cream, cheese-tarts, and all that profusion of\r\nsouthern fruit of which we have already spoken.[759]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 759:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iv. 28. There was a kind of cheese, apparently much in use,\r\n  imported from Gythion, in Laconia. Lucian. Diall. Hetair. xiv. 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known rule among modern gourmands, that no man should utter\r\na syllable at table till the first course is removed, and precisely the\r\nsame regulation prevailed among the ancients. Silence, however, was\r\nsometimes interrupted by the arrival of some wandering buffoon, who,\r\nafter long roaming about in search of a dinner, happened, perhaps, to be\r\nattracted thither by the wings and feathers ostentatiously scattered\r\nbefore the door. This sort of gentry required no introduction: they had\r\nonly to knock and announce themselves to ensure a ready welcome; for\r\nmost men would willingly part with a share of their supper to be made\r\nmerry over the remainder. The Athenian demos was pre-eminently of this\r\nhumour. No king, in fact, ever kept up so large an establishment of\r\nfools by profession, or, which is much the same thing, of wits,—fellows\r\nwho grind their understandings into pointed jests to tickle the risible\r\nmuscles and expand the mouths of sleek junketters, who esteem nothing\r\nbeyond eating and grinning.\r\n\r\nAt a feast given by Callias, the famous jester, Philip, a-kin in spirit,\r\nI trow, to him of Macedon, presented himself in this way, and, on being\r\nadmitted,—“Gentlemen,” said he, “you know my profession and its\r\nprivileges, relying on which I am come uninvited, being a foe to all\r\nceremony, and desiring to spare you the trouble of a formal\r\ninvitation.”—“Take your place,” replied the host; “your company was much\r\nneeded, for our friends appear to be plunged up to the chin in gravity,\r\nand would be greatly benefited by a hearty laugh.”[760]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 760:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph. Conv. i. 13, 14.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn fact, the heads of the honest people were filled with very serious\r\nmeditations, being all in love, and endeavouring to discover how each\r\nmight excel the other in absurdity. Philip began to fear, therefore,\r\nthat he had carried his jests to a bad market, and, in reality, made\r\nmany vain attempts to kindle the spirit of mirth, and call home the\r\nimaginations of persons who had evidently suffered them to stray as far\r\nas the clouds. Aware that success on this point was indispensable to his\r\nsubsistence, the jester grew piqued at the indifference of his hearers,\r\nand breaking off in the midst of his supper, wrapped up his head in his\r\nchlamys, and lay down like one about to die. “What, now!” cried Callias.\r\n“Has any sudden panic seized on thee, friend?”—“The worst possible, by\r\nZeus!” replied Philip; “for, since laughter, like justice, has taken its\r\nleave of earth, my occupation is gone. Hitherto I have enjoyed some\r\ncelebrity in this way, living at the public expense, like the guests of\r\nthe Prytaneion, because my drollery was effective, and could set the\r\ntable in a roar. But it is all over, I see, with me now, for I might as\r\nsoon hope to render myself immortal as acquire serious habits.” All this\r\nhe uttered in a pouting, desponding tone, as if about to shed tears. The\r\ncompany, to humour the joke, undertook to comfort him, and the effect of\r\ntheir mock condolences, and assurances that they would laugh if he\r\ncontinued his supper, was so irresistibly ludicrous, that Autolychos, a\r\nyouthful friend of Callias, was at length unable to restrain his\r\nmerriment; upon which the jester took courage, and apostrophising his\r\nsoul, informed it very gravely, that there would be no necessity for\r\nthem to part company yet.[761]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 761:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph. Conviv. i. 15. 16.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Greeks had, properly speaking, no drawing-rooms, so that, instead of\r\nretreating to another part of the house, they had the tables themselves\r\nremoved immediately after dinner. Libations were then poured out to Zeus\r\nTeleios, and having sung a hymn to Phœbos Apollo, the amusements of the\r\nevening commenced. Professional singers and musicians were always hired\r\non these occasions. They were female slaves, selected in childhood for\r\ntheir beauty and budding talents, and carefully educated by their\r\nowners.[762] When not already engaged, they stood in blooming bevies in\r\nthe agora, waiting, like the Labourers of Scripture, until some one\r\nshould hire them, upon which they proceeded, dressed and ornamented with\r\ngreat elegance, to the house of feasting. But, besides these, there were\r\nother _artistes_ who contributed to the entertainment of the demos,\r\npersons that, like our Indian jugglers, performed wonderful feats by way\r\nof interlude between the regular exhibitions of the damsels from the\r\nagora.[763]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 762:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Luc. Amor. § 10. Schol. Aristoph. Acharn. 1058.\r\n\r\nFootnote 763:\r\n\r\n  The Indian jugglers themselves became known to the Greeks in the age\r\n  of Alexander. Ælian. Var. Hist. viii. 7.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nXenophon introduces into that living picture of Greek manners called the\r\nBanquet, a company of this kind. Finding Philip’s jokes dull things, he\r\nbrings upon the scene a strolling Syracusan, with a beautiful female\r\nflute-player, a dancing girl who could perform surpassing feats of\r\nactivity, and a handsome boy, who, besides performing on the cithara,\r\nwas likewise able, on occasion, to sport the toe like his female\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nBut, where philosophers were present, amusements of this kind were not\r\nallowed to occupy their whole attention. Every thing that occurred was\r\nmade a handle for conversation, so that discussions, more or less\r\nlively, according to the temperament or ability of the interlocutors,\r\nformed the solid ground-work upon which the flowers of gaiety and\r\nlaughter were spread. It was usual, immediately after supper, to perfume\r\nthe guests, and great was the variety of unguents, essences, and odorous\r\noils, made use of by the rich and vain upon these occasions; but when\r\nCallias proposed conforming to the mode in this particular, Socrates\r\nobjected, observing, that the odour of honourable toil was perfume\r\nenough for a man.[764] Women, indeed, to whom every thing sweet and\r\nbeautiful naturally belongs, might, he admitted, make use of perfume,\r\nand they did so most lavishly as we have already shown, when we entered\r\ntheir dressing-room and assisted at their toilette.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 764:\r\n\r\n  Xen. Conv. ii. 4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, however, were careful not to convert their pleasure-parties\r\ninto a mere arena for the exhibition of dialectic power. They from time\r\nto time glanced at philosophy, but only by the way, in the moments of\r\ntransition from one variety of recreation to another. Their conversation\r\nwas now and then brought to a pause by the rising of dancing girls,[765]\r\nrobed elegantly, as we behold them still on vases and on bas-reliefs, in\r\ndrapery adapted to display all the beauty of their forms. Hoops were\r\nbrought them, and while musicians of their own sex called forth\r\nthrilling harmonies from the flute, they executed a variety of graceful\r\nmovements, in part pantomimic,—now casting up the hoops, now catching\r\nthem as they fell, keeping time exactly with the cadences of the flute.\r\nTheir skill in this accomplishment was so great, that many were enabled\r\nto keep up twelve hoops in the air at the same time, while others made\r\nuse of poniards.[766]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 765:\r\n\r\n  Lucian. Amor. § 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 766:\r\n\r\n  Artemid. Oneirocrit. i. 68. Xen. Conviv. ii. 8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen the novelty of this exhibition was worn off a little, other\r\ndifferent feats followed. A hoop stuck all round with upright swords was\r\nplaced in the midst of the apartment, into which one of the dancing\r\ngirls threw herself head foremost, and while standing on her head\r\nbalanced the lower part of her body round over the naked points, to the\r\ninfinite terror of the spectators. She would then dart forth between the\r\nswords, and, with a single bound, regain her footing without the\r\ncircle.[767] To add to the entertainment of the company, some\r\nparasitical buffoon would at times undertake to exhibit his awkwardness\r\nas a foil to the grace of the dancers, frisking about with the clumsy\r\nheaviness of a bear, and exaggerating his own ignorance of orchestics to\r\nexcite a laugh. Sometimes the female dancer, like our own fair tumblers,\r\nwould throw back her head till it reached her heels, and then putting\r\nherself in motion, roll about the room like a hoop.[768] To these, as a\r\nrelief and a change, would succeed, perhaps, a youth with fine rich\r\nvoice, who accompanied himself on the lyre with a song.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 767:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iii. 134.\r\n\r\nFootnote 768:\r\n\r\n  Xen. Conviv. ii. 22.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut nothing could entirely restrain the Greeks from indulging in the\r\npleasure of listening to their own voices. The buzz of conversation\r\nwould soon be heard in different parts of the room, which, when Socrates\r\nwas present, sometimes provoked from him a sarcastic reproof. For\r\nexample, at Callias’s dinner, observing the company broken up into\r\nknots, each labouring at some particular question in dialectics, and\r\nfilling the apartment with a babel of confused murmurs; “As we talk all\r\nat once,” said he, “we may as well sing all at once;” and without\r\nfurther ceremony he pitched his voice and began a song.[769]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 769:\r\n\r\n  Xen. Conviv. vii. 1.\r\n\r\nBut when professed jugglers happened to be present, gentlemen were not\r\nlong abandoned to their own resources for amusement. Trick followed\r\ntrick in rapid succession. To the pantomimic dances, and the sword\r\ncircle, succeeded the exhibition of the potter’s wheel, in which a young\r\ngirl seated on this machine, like a little Nubian at a cow’s-tail in a\r\n_sakia_, was whirled round with great velocity,[770] but retained so\r\nmuch self-possession as to be able both to write and to read. These,\r\nhowever, were merely sources of momentary wonder. Other amusements\r\nsucceeded capable of exciting superior delight, such for example, as the\r\nmimetic dance, which, like that of the ghawazi, could tell a whole story\r\nof love, of adventure, of war, of religious frenzy and enthusiasm,\r\ntransporting by vivid representations the fancy of the spectators to\r\nwarmer or wilder scenes, calling up images and reminiscences of times\r\nlong past, or steeping the thoughts in poetical dreams, filled with the\r\ncaverned nymphs, the merry Seileni, the frisking satyrs, Bacchos, Pan,\r\nthe Hours, the Graces, sporting by moonlit fountains, through antique\r\nwoods, or on the shelled and sand-ribbed margin of the ocean.[771]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 770:\r\n\r\n  Xen. Conviv. vii. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 771:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Legg. vii. t. viii. p. 55. Bekk. Xen. Conv. vii. 5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOn some occasions a slight dramatic scene was represented. Clearing the\r\ncentre of the banqueting hall, the guests ranged themselves in order as\r\nat the theatre. A throne was then set up in the open space, and a female\r\nactor, representing Ariadne, entering, took her seat upon it, decked and\r\nhabited like a bride, and supposed to be in her Thalamos at Naxos.\r\nDionysos, who has been dining with Zeus, comes flushed with Olympian\r\nnectar into the harem to the sound of the Bacchic flute, while the nymph\r\nwho has heard his approaching footsteps makes it manifest by her\r\nbehaviour that her soul is filled with joy, though she neither advances\r\nnor rises to meet him, but restrains her feelings with difficulty, and\r\nremains apparently tranquil. The god, drawing near with impassioned\r\nlooks, and dancing all the while, now seats himself, and places the fair\r\none on his knee. Then, in imitation of mortal lovers, he embraces and\r\nkisses her, nothing loth; for, though she hangs down her head, and would\r\nwish to appear out of countenance, her arms find their way round his\r\nneck and return his embrace. At this the company, we may be sure,\r\nclapped and shouted. The god, encouraged by their plaudits, then stood\r\nup with his bride, and going through the whole pantomime of courtship,\r\nnot coldly and insipidly, but as one whose heart was touched, at length\r\ndemanded of Ariadne if in truth she loved him. Sometimes the mimic scene\r\nconcealed beneath it all the reality of passion. From personating\r\nenamoured characters, the youthful actor and his partner learned in\r\nreality to love; and what was amusement to others contained a deep and\r\nserious meaning for them. This, Xenophon says, was the case with the\r\nyouth and maiden who enlivened the banquet of Callias. Absorbed in the\r\nearnestness of their feelings, they seem to have forgotten the presence\r\nof spectators, and instead of a stage representation, gave them a scene\r\nfrom real life, where every impassioned look and gesture were genuine,\r\nand every fiery glance was kindled at the heart.[772]\r\n\r\nThis, however, may be considered a serious amusement, and something like\r\nbroad farce was necessary to awaken the guests from the reverie into\r\nwhich the love scene had plunged them. Jesters were, therefore, put in\r\nrequisition; and, as even they sometimes failed to raise a laugh, their\r\nmore humorous brethren the wits and jesters of the forests, or, in the\r\nlanguage of mortals, monkeys were called upon to dissipate the clouds of\r\nseriousness. These were the favourite buffoons of the Scythian\r\nAnacharsis,—not the Abbé Barthélemy’s,—who said, he could laugh at a\r\nmonkey’s tricks, because his tricks were natural, but that he found no\r\namusement in a man who made a trade of it.[773] Nor could Euripides at\r\nall relish punsters and manufacturers of jokes, whom he considered, with\r\nsome reason, as a species of animal distinct from mankind.\r\n\r\n         Many there be who exercise their wits\r\n         In giving birth, by cutting jests, to laughter.\r\n         I hate the knaves whose rude unbridled tongues\r\n         Sport with the wise; and cannot for my life\r\n         Think they are men, though laughter doth become them,\r\n         And they have houses filled with treasured stores\r\n         From distant lands.[774]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 772:\r\n\r\n  Xen. Conviv. ix. 1–7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 773:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 774:\r\n\r\n  Eurip. Fragm. Melanipp. 20.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut if Euripides found nothing desirable in laughter, there were those\r\nwho had a clean contrary creed, and lamented nothing so much as the loss\r\nof their risible faculties. On this subject Semos has a story quite _à\r\npropos_. Parmeniscos, the Metapontine, having descended, he says, into\r\nthe cave of Trophonios, became so extremely grave, that with all the\r\nappliances, and means to boot, furnished by wealth, and they were not a\r\nfew, he thereafter found himself quite unable to screw up his muscles\r\ninto a smile; which taking much to heart, as was natural, he made a\r\npilgrimage to Delphi, to inquire by what means he might rid himself of\r\nthe blue devils. Somewhat puzzled at the strangeness of the inquiry, the\r\nPythoness replied,—\r\n\r\n    Poor mortal unmerry, who seekest to know\r\n    What will bid thy brow soften, thy quips and cranks flow,\r\n    To the house of the mother I bid thee repair—\r\n    Thou wilt find, if she’s pleased, what thy heart covets, there.\r\n\r\nUpon this, Parmeniscos hastened homeward, hoping soon to enjoy a good\r\nlaugh as the reward of his industry; but, finding his features remain\r\nfixed as cast-iron, he began to suspect the oracle had deceived him.\r\nSome time after, being at Delos, he beheld with admiration the several\r\nwonders of the island, and, lastly, proceeded to the temple of Leto,\r\nexpecting to find in the mother of Apollo something worthy of so great a\r\ndivinity. But, on entering and perceiving, instead, a grotesque and\r\nsmoky old figure in wood, he burst into an immoderate fit of laughter,\r\nwhereupon the response of the oracle recurred to his mind, and he\r\nunderstood it; and, being thus delivered from his infirmity, he ever\r\nafter held the goddess in extremest reverence.[775]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 775:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEven from this story, therefore, it will be seen how highly “broad\r\ngrins” were estimated in antiquity, particularly at Athens, where there\r\nwas a regular “Wits’ Club,” consisting of threescore members, who\r\nassembled during the Diomeia,[776] in the temple of Heracles. The names\r\nof several of these jovial mortals have come down to us; Mandrogenes,\r\nfor example, and Strato, Callimedon, who, for some particular quality of\r\nmind or body, obtained the _sobriquet_ of the _Lobster_, Deinias,\r\nMnasigeiton, and Menæchmos. The reputation of these gentlemen spread\r\nrapidly through the city, and, when a good thing had a run among the\r\nsmall wits, it was remarked, that “the Sixty had said _that_.” Or, if a\r\nman of talent were asked, whence he came, he would answer, “From the\r\nSixty.” This was in the time of Demosthenes, when, unhappily, jesters\r\nwere in more request in Athens than soldiers; and Philip of Macedon,\r\nhimself no mean buffoon, learning the excellent quality of their _bon\r\nmots_, sent them a present of a talent of gold, with a request that, as\r\npublic business prevented his joining the sittings of the club, they\r\nwould make for his use a collection in writing of all their smart\r\nsayings, which was, probably, the first step towards those repositories\r\nfor stray wit, called “Joe Millers,” that form so indispensable a\r\nportion of a bon vivant’s library.[777]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 776:\r\n\r\n  Eustath. ad Iliad. δ. p. 337. 53.

Though the tables, according\r\nto the fashion of the times, were removed with the solid viands, others\r\nwere brought in to replace them, on which the censers, the goblets, the\r\nsilver or golden ladles for filling the smaller cups, were arranged in\r\norder.[778] The chairman, or, as he was then called, the king of the\r\nfeast,[779] enjoyed absolute power over his subjects, and could\r\ndetermine better than their own palates, how much and how often each man\r\nshould drink. This important functionary was not always identical with\r\nthe entertainer, but sometimes his substitute, sometimes a person chosen\r\nby lot.[780] Capacious bowls of wine,[781] mingled with water, were\r\nplaced on a sideboard, whence cup-bearers, sometimes of one, sometimes\r\nof the other sex, but always selected for their youth and beauty,\r\nfilled, with ladles,[782] the goblets of the guests, which, when the\r\nfroth rose above the brim, were, by an obvious metaphor, said to be\r\ncrowned.[783] Among the Doric Greeks, female cup-bearers seem to have\r\nbeen always preferred; the Ptolemies of Egypt cherished the same taste;\r\nand the people of Tarentum, themselves of Doric race, passing\r\nsuccessively through every stage of luxury, came, at length, to be\r\nserved at table by beautiful young women without a vestige of clothing.\r\nIn most cases, these maidens were slaves, but, in some countries, and\r\neverywhere, in remoter ages, the performance of such offices was not\r\nregarded as any way derogatory to persons of noble or princely blood.\r\nBut, whatever might be their birth, beauty of form and countenance\r\nconstituted their chief recommendation. For there is a language in looks\r\nand gestures, there is a fountain of joy and delight concealed deep in\r\nthe physical structure, and its waters laugh to the eye of intellect,\r\nand reflect into the hearts of those who behold it a sunniness and\r\nexhilaration greater than we derive from gazing on the summer sea.\r\nHence, Hebe and Ganymede were chosen to minister at the tables of the\r\ngods, even Zeus himself[784] not disdaining to taste of the pleasures to\r\nbe derived from basking in the irradiations of beauty.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 778:\r\n\r\n  Among the Etruscans these ladles were of bronze, and of extremely\r\n  elegant form, the point ending in a swan’s or duck’s head.\r\n\r\nFootnote 779:\r\n\r\n  The proceedings of this person were governed by a code of laws, the\r\n  making and reformation of which employed the wits of no less\r\n  personages than Xenophanes, Spensippos, and Aristotle.

Mangey.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen the goblets were all crowned with the nectar of earth, the Master\r\nof the Feast[785] set the example of good-fellowship by drinking to his\r\nguests, beginning with the most distinguished.[786] Originally, custom\r\nrequired him who drank to the health of another to drain off his cup\r\nwhile his comrade did the same; but, in after ages, they sipped only a\r\nportion of the wine, and, as they still do in the East, presented the\r\nremainder to their friend. The latter, by the rules of politeness, was\r\nbound to finish the goblet, or, where the antique fashion prevailed, to\r\ndrink one of equal size.[787] The Macedonians, who, probably, excelled\r\nthe Greeks in drinking, if in nothing else, disdained small cups as\r\nsupplying a very roundabout way to intoxication, and plunged into Lethe\r\nat once by the aid of most capacious bowls. It was customary, when the\r\npractice of passing round the goblet had been introduced, for the king\r\nof the feast to drink to the next man on his right hand, who, in his\r\nturn, drank to the next, and so on till the bowl had circulated round\r\nthe board. But different customs prevailed in the different parts of\r\nGreece. At Athens, small cups, like our wine-glasses, were in use; among\r\nthe Chians, Thracians, and Thessalians, nations more prone to sensual\r\nindulgences, the goblets were of larger dimensions; but, at Sparta,\r\nwhere sobriety and frugality long flourished, the practice was to drink\r\nfrom diminutive vessels, which, as often as required, were replenished\r\nby the attendants.[788]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 785:\r\n\r\n  There were certain barbarians, who, to cement their friendships, drank\r\n  wine tinged with each other’s blood.—Athen. xv. 47.\r\n\r\nFootnote 786:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Symp. i. 2. 2. The first cup was drunk to the\r\n  Agathodemon.—Schol. Aristoph. Eq. 85. Athen. xv. 47.\r\n\r\nFootnote 787:\r\n\r\n  Athen. v. 20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 788:\r\n\r\n  Athen. x. 39. Plut. Cleom. § 13.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIsocrates, in his exhortation to Demonicos, marks the distinction\r\nbetween the true and false friend, by observing, that, while the latter\r\nthinks only of those around him, the former remembers the absent, and\r\nmakes his affection triumph over time and distance. And the Greeks\r\ngenerally had this merit. Amid the enjoyments of the festive board, they\r\nrecalled to mind the friends of other days; and, having first performed\r\nlibations to the gods, those best and purest of friends, drank to the\r\nhealth and prosperity of former associates, now far removed by\r\ncircumstances,[789] and this they did not in the mixed beverage which\r\nformed their habitual potations, but in pure wine.[790] There was\r\nsomething extremely delicate in this idea, for tacitly it intimated,\r\nthat their love placed the objects of it almost on a level with their\r\ndivinities, in whose honour, also, on these occasions, a small portion\r\nof the wine was spilt in libations[791] upon the earth. The young, in\r\nwhose hearts a mistress held the first place,[792] drank deeply in\r\nhonour of their beloved, sometimes equalling the number of cups to that\r\nof the letters forming her name,[793] which, if the custom prevailed so\r\nearly, would account for Ægisthos’s being a sot. Sometimes, however,\r\ntaking the hint from the number of the Graces, they were satisfied with\r\nthree goblets; but, when an excuse for drinking “pottle deep” was\r\nsought, they chose the Muses for their patrons, and honoured their\r\nmistresses’ names with three times three.[794] This is the number of\r\ncheers with which favourite political toasts are received at our public\r\ndinners, though every one who fills his bumper, and cries “hip, hip,\r\nhip, hurrah!” on these occasions, is, probably, not conscious that he is\r\nkeeping up an old pagan custom in honour of the Muses.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 789:\r\n\r\n  Theoc.

Lambinus in loc. p. 143.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe number four was in no favour at the drinking-table, not because it\r\nwas an even number, for they sometimes drank ten, but because some old\r\nsuperstition had brought discredit on it. Our very fox-hunters, however,\r\nexhibit an inferior capacity to many of the ancients in affairs of the\r\nbottle, though when it is the poets who perform the feat, we may safely\r\nconsider them to be simply regaling their fancies on “air-drawn”\r\ngoblets, which cost nothing, and leave no head-aches behind them. On\r\nthis subject there is a very pretty song in the Anthology, which Potter,\r\nfollowing some old edition, completely misrepresents.[795] It deserves\r\nto be well translated, and I would translate it well if I could. The\r\nfollowing at least preserves the meaning:\r\n\r\n            Pour out ten cups of the purple wine,\r\n            To crown Lycidicè’s charms divine;\r\n            One for Euphrantè, young and fair,\r\n            With the sparkling eye and the raven hair.\r\n            Then I love Lycidicè more, you say?\r\n            By this foaming goblet I say ye nay.\r\n            More valued than ten is Euphrantè to me,\r\n            For, as when the heavens unclouded be,\r\n            And the stars are crowding far and nigh\r\n            On the deep deep blue of the midnight sky,\r\n            The moon is still brighter and lovelier far\r\n            Than the loveliest planet or brightest star;\r\n            So, ’mid the stars of this earthly sphere,\r\n            None are so lovely or half so dear\r\n            As to me is Euphrantè young and fair,\r\n            With the sparkling eye and the raven hair.[796]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 795:\r\n\r\n  Antiq. ii. 394, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 796:\r\n\r\n  Marc. Argent. ap. Anthol. Græc. v. 110.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut the Macedonians entertained no respect for poetical goblets: they\r\nloved to scent their moustachios with the aroma of the real rosy wine\r\nwhen it sparkled in the cup,—when it moved itself aright, as the wise\r\nking of Judah expresses it. Plutarch describes briefly one of their\r\ndrinking-bouts which took place on the evening of the day wherein old\r\nKalanos, the Hindù Yoghi, burnt himself alive to escape the colic.\r\nAlexander, on returning from the funeral pile, invited a number of his\r\nfriends and generals to sup with him, and, proposing a drinking contest,\r\nappointed a crown for the victor. Prodigious efforts were made by all\r\npresent to achieve so enviable a triumph; but the man who proved himself\r\nto possess the most capacious interior was Promachos, who is said to\r\nhave swallowed upwards of two gallons. He obtained the prize, which was\r\na golden crown, valued at a talent, but died within three days.[797]\r\nChares, the Mitylenian, relates the matter somewhat differently.\r\nAccording to him, Alexander celebrated funeral games in honour of\r\nKalanos, at his barrow, where horseraces and gymnastic contests took\r\nplace,[798] and a poetical encomium was pronounced upon the Yoghi, who,\r\nlike the rest of his countrymen, was, doubtless, a great toper, and\r\nthence the drinking-match instituted in the evening. Chares says there\r\nwere three prizes; the first, in value, a talent; the second, thirty\r\nminæ, or about a hundred and twenty pounds sterling; the third, three\r\nminæ. The number of aspirants is not stated, but thirty-five (Plutarch\r\nsays forty-one) perished in cold shiverings on the spot, and six more\r\ndied shortly after in the tents.[799]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 797:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Alexand. Magn. §§ 69, 70.\r\n\r\nFootnote 798:\r\n\r\n  Ælian. Var. Hist. ii. 41. Periz.\r\n\r\nFootnote 799:\r\n\r\n  Athen. x. 49.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNumbers have celebrated the military genius of Alexander; but Athenæus\r\nalone has given him due credit for his truly royal power of drinking.\r\nLike his father, Philip, who, in his jolly humour, ruffled the Athenian\r\ndead at Chæronea, where he could safely beard the fallen republicans,\r\nAlexander delighted to spend his evenings among drunken roysterers,\r\nwhose chief ambition consisted in making a butt of their bowels. One of\r\nthese worthies was Proteas, the Macedonian mentioned by Ephippos, in his\r\nwork on the sepulture of Alexander and Hephæstion. He was a man of iron\r\nconstitution, on which wine, whatever quantity he drank, appeared to\r\nmake no impression. Alexander, knowing this, loved to pledge him in huge\r\nbowls, such as none, perhaps, but themselves could cope with. This he\r\ndid even at Babylon, where the climate suffers few excesses to be\r\nindulged in with impunity. Taking a goblet more like a pail than a\r\ndrinking-cup, Alexander caused it to be crowned with wine, which, having\r\ntasted, he presented the bowl to Proteas. The veteran immediately\r\ndrained it off, to the great amusement of the company, and presently\r\nafterwards, desiring to pledge the king, he filled it up again, and\r\nsipping a little, according to custom, passed the bowl to Alexander,\r\nwho, not to be outdone by a subject, forthwith drank the whole. But if\r\nhe possessed the courage, he wanted the physical strength of Proteas:\r\nthe goblet dropped from his hand, his head sank on a pillow, and a fever\r\nensued of which the conqueror of Persia, and the rival of Proteas in\r\ndrinking, died in a few days.[800]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 800:\r\n\r\n  Athen. x. 44.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut to return from these barbarians: as the presence of sober persons\r\nmust always be felt by hard drinkers to be a tacit reproach, it was one\r\nof the rules of good fellowship, that all such as joined not in the\r\ncommon potations should depart. “Drink, or begone!” said the law, and a\r\ngood one in Cicero’s opinion it was, for if men experienced no\r\ndisposition to join in the mirth and enjoyment of the company, what had\r\nthey to do there?[801]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 801:\r\n\r\n  Tuscul. Quæst. ii. 41.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom the existence of these rules, however, an inference has been drawn\r\nunfavourable to the Greek character, as if, because some were merry, the\r\nnation generally must of necessity have been wine-bibbers.[802] But this\r\nis scarcely more logical than the reasoning of a writer, who, because\r\nthe comic poets speak chiefly of the mirth and lighter enjoyments of the\r\nAthenians, very gravely concludes that they busied themselves about\r\nlittle else. The truth is, that like all ardent and energetic people,\r\nthey threw their whole souls into the affair, whether serious or\r\notherwise, in which they happened to be engaged; and besides, while the\r\ncareful and industrious applied themselves to business, there was always\r\nan abundance of light and trifling people to whom eating and drinking\r\nconstituted a serious occupation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 802:\r\n\r\n  Potter, ii. 396.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                            ENTERTAINMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man upon the creations of whose art the principal enjoyments of\r\nGreek gourmands were based was the cook,[803] whose character and\r\nachievements ought not perhaps to be entirely passed over. We are,\r\nindeed, chiefly indebted for our information to the comic poets; but, in\r\nspite of some little exaggeration, the likeness they have bequeathed to\r\nus is probably upon the whole pretty exact.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 803:\r\n\r\n  On famous Cooks see Max. Tyr. Dissert. v. 60. 83. Pollux, vi. 70, seq.\r\n  Athen. iii. 60.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Athenian cook was a singularly heterogeneous being, something\r\nbetween the parasite and the professed jester; he was usually a poor\r\ncitizen, with all the pride of autochthoneïty about him, who considered\r\nit indispensable to acquire, besides his culinary lore, a smattering of\r\nmany other kinds of knowledge, not only for the purpose of improving his\r\nsoups or ragouts, but in order, by the orations he pronounced in praise\r\nof himself, to dazzle and allure such persons as came to the agora in\r\nsearch of an artist of his class. Of course the principal source of his\r\noratory lay among pots and frying-pans, and the wonders effected by his\r\nart. Philemon hits off with great felicity one of these worthies, who\r\ndesires to convey a lofty opinion of himself,—\r\n\r\n         “How strong is my desire ’fore earth and heaven,\r\n         To tell how daintily I cooked his dinner\r\n         ’Gainst his return! By all Athena’s owls!\r\n         ’Tis no unpleasant thing to hit the mark\r\n         On all occasions. What a fish had I—\r\n         And ah! how nicely fried! Not all bedevilled\r\n         With cheese, or browned atop, but though well done,\r\n         Looking alive, in its rare beauty dressed.\r\n         With skill so exquisite the fire I tempered,\r\n         It seemed a joke to say that it was cooked.\r\n         And then, just fancy now you see a hen\r\n         Gobbling a morsel much too big to swallow;\r\n         With bill uplifted round and round she runs\r\n         Half choking; while the rest are at her heels\r\n         Clucking for shares. Just so ’twas with my soldiers;\r\n         The first who touched the dish upstarted he\r\n         Whirling round in a circle like the hen,\r\n         Eating and running; but his jolly comrades,\r\n         Each a fish worshiper, soon joined the dance,\r\n         Laughing and shouting, snatching some a bit,\r\n         Some missing, till like smoke the whole had vanished.\r\n         Yet were they merely mud-fed river dabs:\r\n         But had some splendid scaros graced my pan,\r\n         Or Attic glaucisk, or, O saviour Zeus!\r\n         Kapros from Argos, or the conger eel,\r\n         Which old Poseidon exports to Olympos,\r\n         To be the food of gods, why then my guests\r\n         Had rivalled those above. I have, in fact,\r\n         The power to lavish immortality\r\n         On whom I please, or, by my potent art,\r\n         To raise the dead, if they but snuff my dishes!”[804]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 804:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vii. 32.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis honest fellow, in the opinion of Athenæus, exceeded in boasting\r\neven that Menecrates of Syracuse, who for his pride obtained the surname\r\nof Zeus; he was a physician, and used vauntingly to call himself the\r\narbiter of life to mankind. He is supposed to have possessed some\r\nspecific against epilepsy; but being afflicted with a vanity at least\r\nequal to his skill, he would undertake no one’s cure unless he first\r\nentered into an agreement to follow him round the country ever after as\r\nhis slave, which great numbers actually did. Nicostratos, of Argos, one\r\nof the persons so restored, travelled in his train habited and equipped\r\nlike Heracles; others personated Asclepios, and Apollo, while Menecrates\r\nhimself enacted in this fantastic masquerade the part of Zeus; and, as\r\nthe actors say, he dressed the character well, wearing a purple robe, a\r\ngolden crown upon his head, sandals of the most magnificent description,\r\nand bearing a sceptre in his hand.[805]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 805:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vii. 33.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut whatever might have been the conceit of our Syracusan physician,\r\nthere were those among the cooking race, who certainly lagged not far\r\nbehind him. They usually stunned such as came to hire them with reciting\r\ntheir own praises, laying claim to as much science and philosophy as\r\nwould have sufficed to set up two or three sophists. In fact, to take\r\nthem at their word, there was nothing which they did not know, nothing\r\nwhich they could not do. Painting they professed to comprehend as\r\nprofound connoisseurs, and, no doubt, the soles they fried tasted all\r\nthe better for the accomplishment. In astronomy, medicine, and geometry,\r\nthey appear to have made a still greater proficiency than Hudibras,\r\nnotwithstanding that—\r\n\r\n                  “In mathematics he was greater\r\n                  Than Tycho Brahe, or Erra Pater;\r\n                  For he by geometric scale\r\n                  Could take the size of pots of ale;\r\n                  Discern by sines and tangents strait\r\n                  If bread and butter wanted weight;\r\n                  And wisely tell what hour o’ the day\r\n                  The clock does strike by algebra.”\r\n\r\nIn all this he was a fool to the Athenian cooks; for, by the help of\r\nastronomy, they could tell when mackerel was in season, and at what time\r\nof the year a haddock is better than a salmon. From geometry they\r\nborrowed the art of laying out a kitchen to the best advantage, and how\r\nto hang up the gridiron in one place, and the porridge-pot in another.\r\nTo medicine it is easy to see how deeply they must have been indebted,\r\nsince it not only taught them what meats are wholesome, and what not,\r\nbut also enabled them by some sleight of art to diminish the appetite of\r\nthose voracious parasites, who when they dined out appeared to have\r\nstomachs equal in capacity to the great tun of Heidelberg.[806]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 806:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vii. 37.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMany individuals, half guests, half parasites, used to extract\r\nconsiderable matter for merriment out of the dinner materials, that they\r\nmight render themselves agreeable, and be invited again. Thus Charmos,\r\nthe Syracusan, used to convert every dish served at table into an\r\noccasion for reciting poetical quotations or old proverbs, and\r\nsometimes, perhaps, suffered the fish to cool while he was displaying\r\nhis erudition. He had always civil things to say both to shell-fish and\r\ntripe, so that a person fond of flattery might have coveted to be\r\nroasted, in order that his shade might be soothed with this kind of\r\nincense, which even Socrates allowed was not an illiberal enjoyment. It\r\nwas, however, a common custom among parasites to make extracts from the\r\npoets and carry them in portfolios to the tables of their patrons, where\r\nthey recited all such as appeared to be _à propos_. In this way the\r\nabove Charmos obtained among the people of Messina the reputation of a\r\nlearned man, and Calliphanes,[807] son of Parabrycon,[808] succeeded no\r\nless ingeniously by copying out the first verses of various poems, and\r\nreciting them, so that it might be supposed he knew the whole.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 807:\r\n\r\n  Suidas in v. t. i. p. 1361. c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 808:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 6. “Sic ut παράσιτος, et παραμασήτης vel παραμασύντης\r\n  convivam denotat invocatum, qui absque symbola ad convivium venit; sic\r\n  nomen παραβρύκων (à verbo βρύκω, mordeo, rodo, deglutio) eumdem habet\r\n  significatum.”—Scheigh. Animadv. t. vi. p. 54.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCleanthes, of Tarentum, always spoke at table in verse, so likewise did\r\nthe Sicilian Pamphilos; and these parasites, travelling about with\r\nwallets of poetry on their backs, were everywhere welcomed and\r\nentertained, which might with great propriety have been adduced by\r\nIlgen[809] among his other proofs of the imaginative character of the\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 809:\r\n\r\n  De Scol. Poes. p. 8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nArchestratos, the Syracusan, belonged no doubt to this class. He\r\ncomposed an epic poem on good eating, which commenced with recommending\r\nthat no company, assembled for convivial enjoyment, should ever exceed\r\nfour,[810] or at most five, otherwise he said they would rather resemble\r\na troop of banditti than gentlemen. It had probably escaped him, that\r\nthere were twenty-eight guests at Plato’s banquet. Antiphanes, after\r\nobserving that the parasites had lynx’s eyes to discover a good dinner\r\nthough never invited, immediately adds, that the republic ought to get\r\nup an entertainment for them, upon the same principle that during the\r\ngames an ox[811] was slaughtered some distance from the course at\r\nOlympia, to feast the flies, and prevent them from devouring the\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 810:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 811:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 7. This ox was sacrificed to Zeus the Fly-Chaser, in order\r\n  to prevail on him to drive the swarms of insects, by which the\r\n  spectators were incommoded, beyond the Alpheios. Cf. Plin. Nat. Hist.\r\n  x. 40. ix. 34. Pausan. v. 14. i. viii. 26. 7. Ælian. De Nat. Animal.\r\n  v. 17. xi. 8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBesides Archestratos, there were several other celebrated gastronomers\r\namong the ancients. Of these the principal were Timachidas, of Rhodes,\r\nwho wrote a poem in eleven books on good eating,[812] Noumenios, of\r\nHeraclea, pupil to the physician Dieuches, Metreas, of Pitana, the\r\nparodist Hegemon, of Thasos, surnamed the _Lentil_, by some reckoned\r\namong the poets of the old comedy, Philoxenos, of Leucadia, and a second\r\nPhiloxenos, of Cythera, who composed his work in hexameter verse. The\r\nformer, after chaunting the eulogium of the kettle, comes nevertheless\r\nto the conclusion at last, that superior merit belongs to the\r\nfrying-pan. He earnestly recommended truffles to lovers, but would not\r\nhave them touch the barbel. His anger burst forth with great vehemence\r\nagainst those who cut in pieces fish which should be served up whole;\r\nand, though he admits that a polypus may occasionally be boiled, it was\r\nmuch better, he says, to fry it. From this man the Philoxenian cakes\r\nderived their name; and he it is whom Chrysippos reproaches with half\r\nscalding his fingers in the warm bath and gargling his throat with hot\r\nwater, in order that he might be able to swallow kabobs hissing from the\r\ncoals.[813] He likewise used, at the houses of his friends, to bribe the\r\ncooks to bring up everything fiery hot, that he might help himself\r\nbefore any one else could touch them. A kindred gourmand, in the poet\r\nKrobylos, exclaims: “My fingers are insensible to fire like the Dactyls\r\nof Mount Ida. And ah! how delightful it is to refresh my throat with the\r\ncrackling flakes of broiled fish! Oh I am in fact an oven, not a man!”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 812:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 8. Suidas. v. Τιμαχίδας. t. i. p. 899, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 813:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAccording to Clearchos it was this same Philoxenos, who used to maraud\r\nabout rich men’s houses, followed by a number of slaves laden with wine,\r\nvinegar, oil, and other seasonings. Wherever he smelled the best dinner\r\nhe dropped in unasked, and slipping slily among the cooks, obtained\r\ntheir permission to season the dishes they were preparing, after which\r\nhe took his place among the guests where he fed like a Cyclops. Arriving\r\nonce at Ephesos, by sea, he found, upon inquiry in the market, that all\r\nthe best fish had been secured for a wedding feast. Forthwith he bathed,\r\nand repairing to the house of the bridegroom, demanded permission to\r\nsing the Epithalamium. Every one was delighted; they could do no less\r\nthan invite him to dinner. And “Will you come again to-morrow?” inquired\r\nthe generous host. “If there be no fish in the market,” replied\r\nPhiloxenos. It was this gourmand who wished nature had bestowed on man\r\nthe neck of the crane that the pleasure of swallowing might be\r\nprolonged.[814]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 814:\r\n\r\n  Suid. in v. Φιλοξ. t. ii. p. 1058. c. Athen. i. 10.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPithyllos, another parasite, surnamed “the Dainty,” not content with the\r\nmembrane which nature has spread over the tongue, superinduced\r\nartificially a sort of mucous covering, which retained for a\r\nconsiderable time the flavour of what he ate.[815] To prolong his\r\nluxurious enjoyment as much as possible, he afterwards scraped away this\r\ncurious coating with a fish. Of all ancient gourmands he alone is said\r\nto have made use of artificial finger-points, that he might be enabled\r\nto seize upon the hottest morsels. An anecdote so good as to have given\r\nrise to many modern imitations, is related of Philoxenos, of Cythera.\r\nDining one day with Dionysios, of Syracuse, he observed a large barbel\r\nserved up to the prince, while a very diminutive one was placed before\r\nhim. Upon this, taking up the little fish, he held it to his ear and\r\nappeared to be listening attentively. Dionysios, expecting some humorous\r\nextravagance, made a point of inquiring the meaning of this movement,\r\nand Philoxenos replied, that happening just then to think of his\r\nGalatea,[816] he was questioning the barbel respecting her. But as it\r\nmakes no answer, said he, I imagine they have taken him too young and\r\nthat he does not understand me. I am persuaded, however, that the old\r\nfellow they have placed before your majesty must know all about it. The\r\nking, amused by his ingenuity, immediately sent him the larger fish\r\nwhich he soon questioned effectually.[817]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 815:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 10. Suid. v.

Var.\r\n  Hist. x. 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut the Athenians were not reduced to depend for amusement at table upon\r\nthe invention of these humble companions. They knew how, when occasion\r\nrequired, to entertain themselves, and, in the exuberance of their\r\nhilarity, descended for this purpose to contrivances almost infantine.\r\nThey posed each other with charades, enigmas, conundrums, and,\r\nsometimes, in the lower classes of society, related stories of witches,\r\nlamias, mormos, and other hobgoblins believed in by the vulgar of all\r\nnations. Among persons engaged in public affairs the excitement of\r\npolitical discussion was often, of course, intermingled with their more\r\nquiet pleasures.[818] But with this we have, just now, nothing to do,\r\nnor with the enigmas which we shall describe anon. There was another and\r\nmore elegant practice observed by the Greeks at convivial meetings,\r\nwhich, though not peculiar to them, has nowhere else, perhaps, prevailed\r\nto the same extent,—I mean the introduction of music and the singing of\r\nsongs,[819] light, graceful, and instinct with wit and gaiety, to the\r\nbarbitos or the lyre.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 818:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph. Aves. 1189, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 819:\r\n\r\n  Sch. Aristoph. Eq. 403.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks, generally, the love of music and poetry seemed to be a\r\nspontaneous impulse of nature. Almost every act of life was accompanied\r\nby a song,—the weaver at his loom, the baker at his kneading-trough, the\r\nreaper, the “spinners and the knitters in the sun,” the drawer of water,\r\neven the hard-working wight who toiled at the mill, had his peculiar\r\nsong, by the chaunting of which he lightened his labour. The mariner,\r\ntoo, like the Venetian gondolier, sang at the oar, and the shepherd and\r\nthe herdsman, the day-labourer and the swineherd, the vintager and the\r\nhusbandman, the attendant in the baths, and the nurse beside the cradle.\r\nIt might, in fact, be said, that from an Hellenic village music arose as\r\nfrom a brake in spring. Their sensibilities were tremblingly alive to\r\npleasure. There was elasticity, there was balm in their atmosphere, and\r\njoy and freedom in their souls.—How could they do other than sing?\r\n\r\nBut, if music and poetry thus diffused their delights over the industry\r\nof the laborious, it was quite natural that where men met solely for\r\nenjoyment, these best handmaids of enjoyment should not be absent.\r\nAccordingly, we find that while the goblet circulated, kindling the\r\nimagination, and unbending the mind, the lyre was brought in and a song\r\ncalled for. Nor was the custom of recent date. It prevailed equally in\r\nthe heroic ages, and, like many other features of Greek manners, derived\r\nits origin from religion. For, in early times, men rarely met at a\r\nnumerous banquet, except on occasion of some sacrifice, when hymns in\r\nhonour of the gods constituted an important part of the ceremonies. Thus\r\nHomer, describing the grand expiatory rites by which the Achæan host\r\nsought to avert the wrath of Apollo, observes, that they made great\r\nfeasts, and celebrated the praises of the god amid their flowing\r\ngoblets.[820]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 820:\r\n\r\n  Iliad, α. 492, sqq. Ilgen, Disq. de Scol. Poes. p. 55.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nYet, though the theme of those primitive songs may have been at first\r\nserious, it was, probably, not long before topics better adapted to\r\nfestive meetings obtained the preference. At all events, they soon came\r\nto be in fashion. The first step appears to have been from the gods to\r\nthe heroes, whose achievements, being sometimes tinged with the\r\nludicrous, opened the door to much gay and lively description. And these\r\nconvivial pleasures,[821] so highly valued on earth, were, with great\r\nconsistency, transferred to Olympos, where the immortals themselves were\r\nthought to heighten their enjoyments by songs and merriment.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 821:\r\n\r\n  Conf. Odyss. θ 72, sqq. α. 154. 350.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the ages following, the art of enhancing thus the delights of social\r\nintercourse, so far from falling into neglect, grew to be more than ever\r\ncultivated. Even the greatest men, beginning from the Homeric Achilles,\r\ndisdained not to sing. They did not, says a judicious and learned\r\nwriter, consider it sufficient to perform deeds worthy of immortality,\r\nor to be the theme of poets and musicians, or so far to cultivate their\r\nminds as to be able to relish and appreciate the songs of others, but\r\nincluded music within the circle of their own studies, as an\r\naccomplishment without which no man could pretend to be liberally\r\neducated. For this reason it was objected by Stesimbrotos, as a reproach\r\nto Cimon, that he was ignorant of music, and every other gentlemanly\r\naccomplishment held in estimation among the Greeks;[822] and even\r\nThemistocles himself incurred the charge of rusticity, because, when\r\nchallenged at a party, he refused to play on the cithara.[823]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 822:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Cim. § 4. Afterwards, however, we find Cimon represented as\r\n  singing with great skill. § 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 823:\r\n\r\n  Cicero, Tuscul. Quæst. i. 2. Cf. Ilgen. De Scol. Poes. p. 62.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA different theory of manners prevailed among the Romans, who, like the\r\nmodern Turks, considered it unbecoming a gentleman to sing. But to the\r\nGreeks, a people replete with gaiety and ardour, and whose amusements\r\nalways partook largely of poetry, music presented itself under a wholly\r\ndifferent aspect, and was so far from appearing a mean or sordid study,\r\nthat no branch of education was held in higher honour, or esteemed more\r\nefficacious in promoting tranquillity of mind, or polish and refinement\r\nof manners. The lyre is accordingly said, by Homer, to be a divine gift,\r\ndesigned to be the companion and friend of feasts, where it proved the\r\nsource of numerous advantages. In the first place, persons too much\r\naddicted to the bottle found in this instrument an ally against their\r\nown failing, for, whether playing or listening, a cessation from\r\ndrinking was necessarily effected. Rudeness also and violence, and that\r\nunbridled audacity commonly inspired by wine, were checked by music,\r\nwhich, in their stead, inspired a pleasing exaltation of mind, and joy\r\nfree from all admixture of passion.[824]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 824:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 24. Ilgen, Disq. De Scol. Poes. p. 64.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed that the convivial song soon divested\r\nitself of its religious and sombre character; for, as parties are made\r\nup of persons differing extremely in taste and temperament, it\r\nnecessarily happened that when each was required to sing, much variety\r\nwould be found in the lays, which generally assumed a festive and jocund\r\nair. Hymns in honour of the gods were more sparingly introduced,[825]\r\nnor was much stress laid on the praises of heroes;[826] the spirit of\r\njoviality moulded itself into\r\n\r\n                  Quips and cranks, and wanton wiles;\r\n                  Nods and becks, and wreathed smiles.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 825:\r\n\r\n  The hymn, for example, in honour of Pallas was, in all ages, sung.\r\n  Sch.

After determining the antiquity of the\r\nScolion, which Pindar[830] supposes to have been an invention of\r\nTerpander, or, at least, the verses of the song, but which Ilgen dates\r\nas far back as the heroic period, he observes, that the name itself was\r\nknown in very remote ages, since they formed a separate class among the\r\nworks of Pindar, and are mentioned by Aristophanes and Plato,[831] and\r\nthat, like the Cyclic chorus, it arose out of the circumstances under\r\nwhich it was sung. For as this chorus was called Cyclic, or circular,\r\nbecause chaunted by persons moving in a circle round the altar of\r\nBacchos, so the Scolion, or zig-zag song,[832] received its name from\r\nthe myrtle branch, or the cithara, to which it was sung, being passed\r\nfrom one guest to another in a zig-zag[833] fashion, just as those who\r\npossessed the requisite skill happened to sit at table.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 827:\r\n\r\n  Conf.

At first, it has been conjectured, when manners were rude, and\r\nthe language still in its infancy, singing, like dancing, required no\r\ngreat art, and was little more than those wild bursts of melody still\r\ncommon among the improvisatori of Arabia and other Eastern countries,\r\nbut that from these humble beginnings lyrical poetry took its rise,\r\npreserving still the freedom of its original state, and rising,\r\nunshackled by the rigid laws of metre, to heights of sublimity and\r\ngrandeur beyond which no human composition ever soared. By degrees some\r\ncomplex forms of verse obtained the preference,—such, for example, as\r\nthose of Sappho and Alcæos,—and fixed and definite laws of metre were\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe Scolion, however, always preserved something of its original\r\nspontaneous character, at least in appearance, and the same thing may be\r\npredicated of all their festive lays. But before they gave loose to\r\ntheir gaiety, the deep religious sentiment which pervaded the whole\r\nnation required a pæan, or hymn, to be sung in honour of the gods, and\r\nin this every person present joined.[834] While thus engaged, each\r\nguest, it is supposed, held in his hand a branch of laurel, the tree\r\nsacred to Apollo.[835] To the pæan succeeded another air, which all\r\npresent sang in their turn, holding this time a branch of myrtle,[836]\r\nwhich, like the laurel bough mentioned above, was called æsakos, or the\r\n“branch of song.”[837] The singing commenced with the principal guest,\r\nto whom the symposiarch or host delivered the Cithara[838] and æsakos,\r\ndemanding a song, which, according to the laws of the table, no one\r\ncould refuse. Having performed his part, the singer was, in turn,\r\nentitled to call upon his neighbour, beginning on the right hand, and\r\ndelivering to him the Cithara and the myrtle branch. The second, when he\r\nhad sung, handed it then to the third, the third to the fourth, and so\r\non until the whole circle of the company had been made. It sometimes\r\nhappened, though not often, that among the guests an individual,\r\nunskilled in instrumental music, was found, and, in this case, he sang\r\nwithout accompaniment, holding the æsakos in his hand.[839]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 834:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

Poes. p. 156.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe poets who had the honour thus to cheer the convivial hours of the\r\nGreeks were, in remoter times, Simonides and Stesichoros, and, probably,\r\nAnacreon, with others of the same grade;[840] and, if we may credit\r\nAristophanes, songs were also selected from the plays of Æschylus,\r\nSophocles, and Euripides, as among ourselves from Shakespeare, Beaumont\r\nand Fletcher, or Ben Jonson. It may even be inferred that passages from\r\nHomer himself[841] were sung on these occasions; or, if not sung, they\r\nwere certainly recited by rhapsodists introduced for the purpose into\r\nthe assembly, who, holding a laurel branch while thus engaged, probably\r\ngave rise to the practice of passing round the myrtle bough. This\r\nbranch, therefore, whether of myrtle or laurel,[842] constituted a part\r\nof a singer’s apparatus. The latter was originally chosen as sacred to\r\nApollo, the patron of music, and because it was also believed to be\r\nendowed with something of prophetic power, the Pythoness eating its\r\nleaves before she ascended the tripod, while it was the symbol of\r\never-during song. Instead of the laurel, myrtle was afterwards\r\nintroduced, on account, probably, of its being sacred to Aphrodite,\r\nwhose praises were celebrated in those amatory songs common at feasts.\r\nIt may, likewise, have been considered an emblem of republican virtue,\r\nsince Harmodios and Aristogeiton concealed their swords in a myrtle\r\nwreath.[843]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 840:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph.

These lays, like the rest, made\r\nthe circle of the company, though not by passing in an unbroken series\r\nfrom man to man, but, as has already been said, from one skilful singer\r\nto another. In fact, the chanting of the scolia was a kind of contest\r\nwhich took place when all the other songs were concluded.[844] The\r\nperson who occupied the seat of honour chanted to the Cithara a song\r\ncontaining the praises of some mortal or immortal, or the developement\r\nof some moral precept or erotic subject, which was comprehended in a\r\nsmall number of verses. When he had finished, he handed the Cithara and\r\nmyrtle, at his own discretion, to some other among the guests, and the\r\nperson thus challenged, who could not refuse without passing for an\r\nilliterate clown, must at once take up the same subject, and, without\r\ndelay or premeditation, break forth into a song in the same metre and\r\nnumber of verses, if possible; and if unfamiliar with the Cithara, he\r\ncould sing to the myrtle. The second singer now exercised his privilege\r\nand called upon a third, who was expected to do as he had done; so that\r\nvery often the same idea underwent five or six transformations in the\r\ncourse of the evening. When the first argument had thus made the circle\r\nof the company, he who concluded had the right to start a new theme,\r\nwhich received the same treatment as the first; so that sometimes, when\r\npeople were in a singing humour, air followed air, until eight or ten\r\nsubjects had received all the poetical ornaments which the invention of\r\nthose present could bestow upon them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 844:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xv. 49.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut to sing without wine would have been insipid. I have said the\r\nchanting of the scolia was a sort of contest, and, as he who contends\r\nand obtains the victory looks naturally for a reward, so the successful\r\nperformer aspired to his, which, it must be owned, was not\r\ninappropriate, consisting of a brimming bowl, called _odos_, or the “cup\r\nof song,” at once a mark of honour and a reward of skill.[845] All these\r\nparticulars are inferable from the examples of the scolion, which still\r\nremain; and Aristophanes in the “Wasps,” presents something like an\r\noutline, though dim and obscure, both of the argument and the mode of\r\nexecution. He imagines a company of jolly fellows,[846] such as Theoros,\r\nÆschines, Phanos, Cleon, Acestor, and a foreigner of the same kidney,\r\nand represents them as engaged in performing certain scolia for their\r\nown entertainment.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 845:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xi. 110.\r\n\r\nFootnote 846:\r\n\r\n  Vesp. 1220.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut the idea we should form of this kind of song from the very comic\r\npassage in the “Wasps” differs materially from the theoretic view of\r\nIlgen, since Philocleon constantly interrupts his son, terminating each\r\nsentence for him in a manner wholly unexpected, and of course calculated\r\nto excite laughter.\r\n\r\nBut though musical, the Greeks would not imitate the grasshoppers,[847]\r\nwho are said to sing till they starve; but, having accomplished the\r\ncircle above-mentioned, proceeded to other amusements which, though too\r\nnumerous to be described at length, must not be altogether passed over.\r\nIn the heroic ages the discovery had not been made that rest after meals\r\nis necessary to digestion, which in later times was a received maxim,\r\nand accordingly we find from the practice of the Phæacians,[848] who, if\r\nan after-dinner nap had been customary, would certainly have taken it,\r\nthat the men of those times, instead of indulging in indolent repose out\r\nof compliment to their stomachs, sallied forth to leap, to run, to\r\nwrestle, and engage in other athletic sports, which by no means appear\r\nto have impaired their health or their prowess. As civilisation\r\nadvances, however, excuses are found for laying aside the habits of\r\nviolent exercise. Science, in too many cases, fosters indolence and\r\npronounces what is fashionable to be wise. But to the race-course and\r\nthe wrestling-ring, sedentary, or at least indoor, pastimes succeed,\r\nand, instead of overthrowing their antagonists on the palæstra-floor or\r\nthe greensward, men seek to subdue them at Kottabos, or on the\r\nchess-board, or to ruin them at the card-table or in the billiard-room.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 847:\r\n\r\n  Plato Phædr. t. i. p. 65.\r\n\r\nFootnote 848:\r\n\r\n  Homer.

Etym. Mag. 538. 13, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nUnder each of these vessels stood a broad-mouthed vase, filled with\r\nwater, with a gilt bronze statue, called Manes, fixed upright in its\r\ncentre. The persons who played at the game, standing at some little\r\ndistance, cast, in turn, their wine, from a drinking-cup into one of the\r\npensile basins, which descending with the weight, struck against the\r\nhead of the statue, which resounded with the blow. The victor was he who\r\nspilled least wine during the throw, and elicited most noise from the\r\nbrazen head. It was, in fact, in its origin a species of divination, the\r\nobject being to discover by the greater or less success obtained, the\r\nplace occupied by the player in his mistress’s affections. By an\r\nonomatopœa the sound created by the wine in its projection was called\r\n_latax_, and the wine itself _latagè_. Both the act of throwing and the\r\ncup used were called _ankula_, from the word which expresses the\r\ndexterous turn of the hand with which the skilful player cast his wine\r\ninto the scales.[850]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 850:\r\n\r\n  Potter, ii. 405, 406.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOur learned Archbishop Potter, who has not unskilfully abridged the\r\naccount of Athenæus, confounds the above with the _kottabos katactos_,\r\nanother form of the game described both by Pollux and Athenæus.[851] In\r\nthis the apparatus was suspended like a chandelier from the roof. It was\r\nformed of brass, and a brazen vessel, called the skiff, was placed\r\nbeneath it. The player, standing at a little distance, with a long wand,\r\nstruck one end of the kottabos, which descending came in contact with\r\nthe skiff, or rather the manes within, and produced a hollow sound.\r\nOccasionally the small vessels at the extremity of the kottabos were\r\nbrought down, as in the former game, by having wine cast into them.\r\nAnother variety required the skiff to be filled with water, upon which\r\nfloated a ball, an instrument like the tongue of a balance, a manes,\r\nthree myrtle boughs, and as many phials. In this the great art consisted\r\nin striking some one of these with the kottabos, and whoever could sink\r\nmost of them won the game. The prize, on these occasions, was usually\r\none of those cakes called _pyramos_[852] or something similar; but\r\ninstead of these it was sometimes agreed, when women were present, that\r\nthe prize should be a kiss, as in our game of forfeits. Another kind of\r\nkottabos, chiefly practised on those occasions which resembled our\r\nchristenings, when on the tenth day the child received its name, was a\r\ncontention of wakefulness, when the person who longest resisted sleep,\r\nwon the prize. Properly, however, kottabos was the amusement first\r\ndescribed; and so fashionable did it become, that persons erected\r\ncircular rooms expressly for the purpose, in order that the players\r\nmight take their stand at equal distances from the apparatus which stood\r\nin the centre.[853]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 851:\r\n\r\n  Pollux. vi. 100, sqq.

The\r\nSpartans, like all military people, were grievously addicted to jokes,\r\nwhich among them supplied the place of that elegant badinage,\r\nalternating with profound or impassioned discourse, familiar to the more\r\nintellectual Athenians. The latter, however, though free from the\r\ncoarseness, possessed more than the mirthfulness of the Dorians, and in\r\nthe midst of their habits of business and application to philosophy,\r\nknew better than any people how, amidst wine and good-eating, to unbend\r\nand enjoy the luxury of careless trifling and an unwrinkled brow. While\r\nsome therefore retired to the kottabos-room, which occupied the place of\r\nour billiard-room, others still sat clustered round the table,\r\nextracting amusement from each other. Among these of course would be\r\nfound all such as excelled in the art of small talk, who could tell a\r\ngood story or anecdote, scatter around showers of witticisms, or give\r\nbirth to a pun. Some, like the Spartans, had a Welsh passion for\r\ngenealogies, and loved to run back over the history of the “Landed\r\nGentry” of old Hellas, to the time of Deucalion or higher; others coined\r\ntheir wisdom and experience into fables, for which they exhibited an\r\nalmost Oriental fondness; while the greater number, like the princes in\r\nthe Arabian Nights, exercised their wits in propounding and resolving\r\ndifficult questions, enigmas, charades, anagrams, and conundrums.\r\n\r\nBut the principal classes into which these contrivances were divided\r\nwere two: _enigmas_ and _griphoi_,[854] the former comprehending all\r\nthose terminating in mere pleasure, the latter such questions and\r\nriddles as involved within themselves the kernel of wisdom or\r\nknowledge,[855] supposed to have been a dull and serious affair.\r\nCasaubon,[856] however, vindicates it stoutly from this charge,\r\naffirming that in the griphos the _utile_ was mingled with the _dulce_\r\nin due proportion; so that it must, according to Horace’s opinion, have\r\nborne away the palm from most literary inventions. In point of\r\nantiquity, too, the riddle may justly boast; for, if to be old is to be\r\nnoble, it has “more of birth and better blood” even than the hungry\r\nDorians of the Peloponnesos, whom Mr. Mitchell prefers, on this account,\r\nbefore all nations of Ionic race. Like everything good also it comes\r\nfrom the East. The earliest mention of the riddle occurs in the book of\r\nJudges,[857] where Samson, during his marriage-feast at Timnath,\r\nperplexes his guests with the following riddle:\r\n\r\n  “Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth\r\n  sweetness;”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 854:\r\n\r\n  Vid.

This writer, a sort of Greek D’Israeli,\r\ndefines the griphos to mean “a sportive problem proposed for solution on\r\ncondition, that the discovery of the sense should be attended by a\r\nreward, and failure with punishment.” His description of the seven\r\nclasses could scarcely be rendered intelligible, and certainly not\r\ninteresting to the modern reader. It will be more to the purpose to\r\nintroduce two or three specimens, prefacing them by a few remarks.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 858:\r\n\r\n  Pollux. vi. 108. Scalig.

The reward also and the penalty had the same tendency. A\r\ncrown, an extra junket, and the applause of the company, cheered the\r\nsuccessful Œdipos, while the lackwit who beat about the bush without\r\ncatching the owl, had to make wry faces over a cup of brine or pickle.\r\nTheodectes, the sophist, a man distinguished for the excellence of his\r\nmemory, obtained reputation as a riddle-solver, and denominated such\r\nquestions the “springs of memory.”[860] But whatever the interrogatories\r\nthemselves may have been, the reward, to which their solution often led,\r\nwas rather a source of forgetfulness, consisting of a goblet of wine\r\nwhich, when no interpreter could be found, passed to the\r\npropounder.[861]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 860:\r\n\r\n  Pollux. vi. 108.\r\n\r\nFootnote 861:\r\n\r\n  Etym.

Suidas. v. γρῖφος, t. i. p. 628, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe riddle was of course a mine of wealth to the comic poets, who could\r\nnot be supposed to forego the use of so admirable a contrivance to raise\r\nexpectation and beget surprise. But it is clear, from the examples still\r\npreserved, that they oftener missed than hit. Antiphanes’s griphoi on\r\n“bringing and not bringing;” on the “porridge-pot;” on a “tart,” &c.,\r\nare poor things; but the following from the “Dream” of Alexis is good:\r\n\r\n       A. A thing exists which nor immortal is,\r\n       Nor mortal, but to both belongs, and lives\r\n       As neither god nor man does. Every day,\r\n       ’Tis born anew and dies. No eye can see it,\r\n       And yet to all ’tis known.\r\n\r\n       B.             A plague upon you!\r\n       you bore me with your riddles.\r\n\r\n       A.             Still, all this\r\n       Is plain and easy.\r\n\r\n       B. What then can it be?\r\n\r\n       A. SLEEP—that puts all our cares and pains to flight.[862]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 862:\r\n\r\n  Athen. x. 71.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe following from Eubulos is not amiss:\r\n\r\n         A. What is it that, while young, is plump and heavy,\r\n         But, being full grown, is light, and wingless mounts\r\n         Upon the courier winds, and foils the sight?\r\n\r\n         B. The THISTLE’S BEARD; for this at first sticks fast\r\n         To the green seed, which, ripe and dry, falls off\r\n         Upon the cradling breeze, or, upwards puffed\r\n         By playful urchins, sails along the air.\r\n\r\nAntiphanes, in his Sappho, introduces a very ingenious riddle, partly\r\nfor the purpose of offering a sarcastic explanation directed against the\r\norators:\r\n\r\n           There is a female which within her bosom\r\n           Carries her young, that, mute, in fact, yet speak,\r\n           And make their voice heard on the howling waves,\r\n           Or wildest continent. They will converse\r\n           Even with the absent, and inform the deaf.[863]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 863:\r\n\r\n  Athen. x. 73.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe poet introduces the “Lesbian maid,” explaining the riddle, and this\r\npassage of the Athenian comic writer may be regarded as the original of\r\nthose fine lines in Ovid, which Pope has so elegantly translated:\r\n\r\n        Heaven first taught LETTERS for some wretch’s aid,\r\n        Some banish’d lover, or some captive maid,\r\n        They live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires,\r\n        Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires,\r\n        The virgin’s wish without her fears impart,\r\n        Excuse the blush and pour out all the heart,\r\n        Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,\r\n        And waft a sigh from Indus to the pole.\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, the reader will probably be of opinion, that we\r\nhave lingered long enough about the dinner-table and its attendant\r\npastimes. We shall therefore hasten the departure of the guests, who\r\nafter burning the tongues of the animals that had been sacrificed, to\r\nintimate that whatever had been uttered was to be kept secret, offered\r\nlibations to Zeus, Hermes, and other gods, and took their leave, in\r\nancient times before sunset; but afterwards, as luxury and extravagance\r\nincreased, the morning sun often enabled them to dispense with\r\nlink-boys. Examples, indeed, of similar perversions of the night occur\r\nin Homer and Virgil, but always among the reckless or effeminate in the\r\npalaces of princes, whence, in all ages, the stream of immorality has\r\nflowed downward upon society to disturb and pollute it. The company\r\nassembled at Agathon’s, also, sit up all night in Plato; and\r\nAristophanes represents drunken men reeling home through the agora by\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                              THE THEATRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is far from being my purpose to repeat the information which may be\r\nobtained from a hundred authors on the rise and progress of scenic\r\nrepresentation in Greece. I shall, on the contrary, confine myself\r\nchiefly to those parts of the subject which others have either\r\naltogether neglected, or treated in a concise and unsatisfactory manner.\r\nIt would, nevertheless, be beside my purpose to attempt the clearing up\r\nof all such difficulties as occur in the accounts transmitted to us of\r\nthe Hellenic drama; and, in fact, notwithstanding the laborious\r\ninvestigations into which I have been compelled to enter, I feel that\r\nthere are many points upon which I can throw no new light, and which\r\nappear likely for ever to baffle the ingenuity of architects and\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\nDionysos, being a deity connected with agriculture, his worship\r\nnaturally took its rise, and for a long time prevailed chiefly, in the\r\ncountry. His festivals were celebrated with merriment; and, the power of\r\nmimicry being natural to man, the rustics, when congregated to set forth\r\nthe praise of their tutelar god, easily glided into the enactment of a\r\nfarcical show. And dramatic exhibitions at the outset were little\r\nsuperior to the feats of Punch, though, so great was their suitableness\r\nto the national character, that, in the course of time, every town of\r\nnote had its own theatre, as it had of old its own dithyrambic\r\nbard;[864] and dramatic writers were multiplied incomparably beyond what\r\nthey have been in any other country.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 864:\r\n\r\n  Schol. Aristoph. Av. 1404.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBoth tragedy and comedy,[865] properly so called, took their rise in\r\nAttica, and there only, in the ancient world, flourished and grew up to\r\nperfection. The theatre, in fact, formed at length a part of the\r\nconstitution, and, probably, the worst part, its tendency being to\r\nfoster personal enmities, to stir the sources of malice, and, while\r\npretending to purge off the dross of the passions by the channels of\r\nsorrow and mirth, to induce habits of idleness and political apathy, by\r\naffording in the brilliant recesses of a mock world a facile refuge from\r\nthe toils and duties of the real one. Nevertheless, it may be curious to\r\nopen up a view into that universe of shadows wherein the vast creations\r\nof Æschylus, of Sophocles, of Euripides, of Aristophanes, and Menander\r\ndisplayed themselves before the eyes of the Athenians, with a costly\r\ngrandeur and magnificence never equalled save in imperial Rome.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 865:\r\n\r\n  See Bentley, Dissert. on Phal. i. 251.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt has been already remarked, that to the Dionysiac theatre of Athens\r\nthe architectural speculations of Vitruvius on dramatic edifices apply,\r\nthis building having constituted the model on which similar structures\r\nwere afterwards erected.[866] By carefully studying its details,\r\ntherefore, we shall be enabled to form a tolerably just conception of\r\nall the theatres once found in Greece, though each, perhaps, may have\r\nbeen slightly modified in plan, general arrangement, and decorations, by\r\nthe peculiarities of the site, and the science or taste of its\r\narchitect.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 866:\r\n\r\n  On the form and construction of ancient theatres, see Chandler,\r\n  Travels, &c., who describes the ruins of the theatre of Teos. i. 110;\r\n  of Ephesos, 138; of Miletos, (457 feet in length,) 168; of Myos, 191;\r\n  of Stratonica, 222; of Nysa, built with a blue-veined marble, 245; of\r\n  Laodicea, 262; of Ægina, ii. 16; of Athens, 113; of Eleusis, 215; on\r\n  the theatre of Syracuse, see Antiq. of Athens, &c.

The conjecture of Hemsterhuis on the passage of\r\n  Dicæarchos cannot be adopted. The words must apply to the theatre; for\r\n  he says the Parthenon charmed the spectators. But this could not apply\r\n  to the Odeion, which was roofed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo determine accurately the various parts of the theatre, and thus affix\r\na distinct meaning to every term connected with it, has exercised the\r\ningenuity of critics and architects for the last three hundred years,\r\nstill leaving many difficulties to be overcome. I can scarcely hope in\r\nevery case to succeed where they have failed. But the following\r\nexplanation may, perhaps, convey of its interior an idea sufficiently\r\nexact for all practical purposes.\r\n\r\nSupposing ourselves to be standing at the foot of the Katatomè,[870] a\r\nsmooth wall of rock, rising perpendicularly from the back of the theatre\r\nto the superimpending fortifications of the Acropolis, we behold on\r\neither hand, surmounted by porticoes, lofty piers of masonry projecting\r\nlike horns down the rocky slope into the plain and united at their\r\nextremities by a wall of equal height, running in a straight line from\r\none point of the horseshoe to the other. The space thus enclosed is\r\ndivided into three principal parts,—the amphitheatre for the spectators,\r\nthe orchestra,[871] filling all the space occupied by the modern pit,\r\nfor the chorus, and the stage, properly so called, for the actors. Each\r\nof these parts was again subdivided. Looking down still from the\r\nKatatomè, we behold the benches of white marble, sweeping round the\r\nwhole semicircle of the theatre, descend like steps to the level of the\r\norchestra, and intersected at intervals by narrow straight passages\r\nconverging towards a point below.[872] A number of the upper seats, cut\r\noff, by an open space extending round the whole semicircle, from the\r\nrest, was set apart for the women. Other divisions were appropriated to\r\nother classes of the population, as the tier of seats immediately\r\noverlooking the orchestra to the senators, or dicasts, another portion\r\nto the youth, another to foreigners and the guests of the state, while\r\nthe remainder was occupied by the dense mass of citizens of all\r\nages,[873] with crowns of flowers on their heads.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 870:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 123.\r\n\r\nFootnote 871:\r\n\r\n  Tim.

Another range of porticoes extended\r\nalong the small lawn or grove within the limits of the theatre, at the\r\nback of the stage, so that there was little necessity for the Athenian\r\npeople to take refuge, as some have imagined, from the weather in the\r\npublic buildings, sacred or civil, in the vicinity.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 874:\r\n\r\n  Vitruv. v. 9.

Theophrastus, accordingly, whom few striking traits of\r\nmanners escaped, represents his flatterer snatching this theatrical\r\ncushion from the slave, and adjusting and obsequiously smoothing it for\r\nhis patron.[879] To render their devotion to Dionysos still less\r\nirksome, it was customary to hand round cakes and wine during the\r\nrepresentation, though, like Homer’s heroes, they were careful to\r\nfortify themselves with a good meal before they ventured abroad. We are\r\ninformed, moreover, that when the actors were bad there was a greater\r\nconsumption of confectionary, the good people being determined to make\r\nup in one kind of enjoyment what they lost in another. Full cups,\r\nmoreover, were habitually drained on the entrance and exit of the\r\nchorus.[880]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 876:\r\n\r\n  Onomast. iv. 122.—To kick the seats with the heel was called\r\n  πτερνοκοπεῖν, which they did when they wanted to drive away an actor,\r\n  id. ibid.

After\r\n  attentively viewing the seats of several ancient theatres, and\r\n  “considering their height, width, and manner of arrangement, I am\r\n  inclined to believe that the ancient Asiatics sate at their plays and\r\n  public spectacles, like the modern, with under them, and, it is\r\n  probable, upon carpets.”—Travels, &c. i. 269.\r\n\r\nFootnote 879:\r\n\r\n  Charact. c. ii. p. 10.

That part of the orchestra\r\nwhich lay between the Thymele and the stage was denominated the\r\nDromos, while the name of Parodoi was bestowed on those two spacious\r\nside-passages,[882] the one from the east, the other from the west, at\r\nthe extremities of the tiers of seats which afforded the chorus ample\r\nroom for marching in and out in rank and file, in the quadrangular\r\nform it usually affected.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 881:\r\n\r\n  Etym.

The descent from the stage[885] into the orchestra was by\r\ntwo flights of steps situated at either extremity of the Logeion, at the\r\npoint where the Parodoi touched upon the Dromos. Beyond the Proscenion\r\narose the Scene,[886] properly so called, the aspect of which was\r\nconstantly varied, to suit the requirements of each successive piece. In\r\nmost cases, however, it represented the front of three different\r\nedifices, of which the central one, communicating with the stage by a\r\nbroad and lofty portal, was generally a palace. Sometimes, as in the\r\nPhiloctetes, this portal was converted into the mouth of a cavern,[887]\r\nopening upon the view, amid the rocks and solitudes of Lemnos, while in\r\nother plays it formed the entrance to the mansion of some private person\r\nof distinction, but was always appropriated to the principal actor. The\r\nbuilding on the right assumed in comedy the appearance of an inn,\r\nthrough the door of which the second actor issued upon the stage, while\r\nthe portal on the left led into a ruined temple, or uninhabited house.\r\nIn tragedy the right hand entrance was appropriated to strangers, while\r\non the left was that of the female apartments, or of a prison.[888]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 883:\r\n\r\n  Plat.

Vid. Spanh. ad Callim. t. ii. p. 228, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen the stage was fitted up for the performance of comedy, there stood\r\nnear the house a painted scene representing a large cattle-shed, with\r\ncapacious double gates, for the admission of waggons and sumpter oxen,\r\nwith herds and droves of asses, when returning from the field. In the\r\nAkestriæ of Antiphanes,[890] this rustic building was converted into a\r\nworkshop. Beyond each of the side-doors on the right and left were two\r\nmachines,[891] one on either hand, upon which the extremity of the\r\nperiactoi abutted. The scene on the right represented rural landscapes,\r\nthat on the left prospects in the environs of the city, particularly\r\nviews of the harbour. On these periactoi,[892] were represented the\r\nmarine deities riding on the waves, and generally all such objects as\r\ncould not be introduced by machinery. By turning the periactoi on the\r\nright, the situation was changed, but when both were turned a wholly new\r\nlandscape was placed before the eye. Of the parodoi, or side-passages,\r\nthat on the right led from the fields, from the harbour, or from the\r\ncity, as the necessities of the play required, while those arriving on\r\nfoot from any other part entered by the opposite passage, and,\r\ntraversing a portion of the orchestra, ascended the stage by the flights\r\nof steps before mentioned.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 890:\r\n\r\n  Scalig. reads Antipho.

To avoid\r\nlabour, and, perhaps, some tediousness, these might be passed over with\r\nsuch a remark as the above, but this would be to escape from\r\ndifficulties not to diminish them. I shall descend to particulars.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 893:\r\n\r\n  Vid. Buleng. De Theat. c. 21.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFirst, and most remarkable, was that machine called an Eccyclema,[894]\r\nmuch used by the ancients when scenes within-doors were to be brought to\r\nview. It consisted of a wooden structure, moved on wheels, and\r\nrepresented the interior of an apartment. In order to pass forth through\r\nthe doors, it was formed less deep than broad, and rolled forth\r\nsideways, turning round afterwards, and concealing the front of the\r\nbuilding from which it had issued. The channels in the floor, which were\r\ntraversed by the wheels, doubtless concealed beneath the lofty basis,\r\nreceived the name of Eiscyclema.[895] Sometimes, as in the Agamemnon, it\r\npresented to view “the royal bathing apartment with the silver laver,\r\nthe corpse enveloped in the fatal garment, and Clytemnestra, besprinkled\r\nwith blood, and holding in her hand the reeking weapon, still standing\r\nwith haughty mien over her murdered victim.”[896] On other occasions a\r\nthrone, a corpse, the interior of a tent, the summit of a building, were\r\nexhibited; and in the Clouds of Aristophanes the interior of Socrates’\r\nhouse was laid open to the spectators, containing a number of masks,\r\ngaunt and pale, the natural fruit of philosophy.[897] It should be\r\nremarked that the Eccyclema issued through any of the doors, as the\r\npiece required the cells of a prison, the halls of a palace, or the\r\nchambers of an inn, to be placed before the eyes of the audience.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 894:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 127, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 895:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 128.\r\n\r\nFootnote 896:\r\n\r\n  Müller, Dissert. on the Eumenid. p. 91.\r\n\r\nFootnote 897:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

This, in tragedy, was denominated Mechanè, and Kradè in\r\ncomedy,[899]—in this case resembling a fig-tree, which the Athenians\r\ncalled Kradè. The watch-tower, the battlements, and the turret, were\r\nconstructed for the use of those watchmen, such as the old man in the\r\nAgamemnon, who looked out for signals, or indications of the coming foe.\r\nThe Phructorion[900] was a pharos, or beacon-tower. Another portion of\r\nthe stage was the Distegia, a building two stories high in palaces, from\r\nthe top of which, in the Phœnissœ of Euripides,[901] Antigone beholds\r\nthe army. It was roofed with tiles, (and thence called Keramos,) which\r\nthey sometimes cast down upon the enemy. In comedy, libertines and old\r\nwomen, or ladies of equivocal character, were represented prying into\r\nthe street for prey from such buildings.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 898:\r\n\r\n  Ξενοκλῆς ὁ Καρκίνου δοκεῖ μηχανὰς καὶ τερατείας εἰσάγειν ν τοῖς\r\n  δράμασι.

Within seem to have been a number of lamps, on\r\nstationary bases, from which, as the periactos whirled round, sheets of\r\nmimic lightning flashed upon the stage from behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 902:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 127, 130.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Bronteion,[903] or thunder magazine, I imagine\r\nto have been nearly as follows:—a number of brazen plates, arranged one\r\nbelow another, like stairs, descended through a steep, vaulted passage\r\nbehind the scene, into the bottom of a tower, terminating in a vast\r\nbrazen caldron. From the edge of this, a series of metallic\r\napertures,[904] probably spiral, pierced the tower wall, and opened\r\nwithout in funnels, like the mouths of trumpets.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 903:\r\n\r\n  Idem, Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 904:\r\n\r\n  These were called ἠχεῖα.

Aristoph.

Here Zeus, and the other deities of Olympos,\r\nwere assembled in that very extraordinary drama of Æschylus, the\r\nPsychostasia, or weighing in the balance the souls of Achilles and\r\nHector.\r\n\r\nThey employed in the theatre the machine called a Crane,[906] the point\r\nof which being lowered, snatched up whatever it was designed to bear\r\naloft into the air. By means of this contrivance, Eos, goddess of the\r\ndawn, descended and bore away the body of Memnon, slain by Achilles\r\nbefore Troy. At other times strong cords, so disposed as to resemble\r\nswings, were let down from the roof, to support the gods or heroes who\r\nseemed to be borne through the air.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 906:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 130.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThough by turning the Periactoi three changes of scene could be\r\nproduced, many more were sometimes required, and, when this was the\r\ncase, new landscapes were dropped, like hangings, or slided in frames in\r\nfront of those painted columns. These usually represented views of the\r\nsea, or mountain scenery, or the course of some river winding along\r\nthrough solitary vales, or other prospects of similar character,\r\naccording to the spirit of the drama.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Hemicycle is more difficult to comprehend. It\r\nappears to have been a retreating semicircular scene, placed facing the\r\norchestra, and masking the marble buildings at the back of the stage,\r\nwhen a view was to be opened up into some distant part of the city, or\r\nshipwrecked mariners were to be exhibited buffeting with the waves. Not\r\nvery dissimilar was the Stropheion,[907] which brought to view heroes\r\ntranslated to Olympos, or on the ocean, or in battle slain, where change\r\nof position with respect to the spectator was produced by the rotatory\r\nmotion of the machine.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 907:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 131.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe position of the Charonian staircase,[908] by which spectres and\r\napparitions ascended from the nether world, is exceedingly difficult to\r\nbe determined; but that it was somewhere on the stage appears to me\r\ncertain, notwithstanding the seeming testimony of Pollux to the\r\ncontrary. The hypothesis which makes the ghosts issue from a door\r\nimmediately beneath the seats of the spectators, and rush along the\r\nwhole depth of the orchestra, among the chorus and musicians, is, at any\r\nrate, absurd. It must have been somewhere towards the back of the stage,\r\nnear the altar of Loxios, the table of shew-bread and those sacred and\r\nantique images which in certain dramas were there exhibited. Here,\r\nlikewise, was the trap-door, through which river-gods issued from the\r\nearth, while the other trap-door, appropriated to the Furies, seems to\r\nhave been situated in the boards of the Logeion, near one of the flights\r\nof steps leading down into the orchestra.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 908:\r\n\r\n  Id. iv. 132.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe above synopsis of the machinery and decorations employed by the\r\nGreeks in their theatrical shows may, possibly, from its imperfection,\r\nsuggest the idea of a rude and clumsy apparatus. But, as the arts of\r\npoetry, sculpture, painting, and architecture reached in Greece the\r\nhighest perfection, and, as this perfection was coëtaneous with the\r\nflourishing state of the drama, it is impossible to escape the\r\nconviction, that the art of scene-painting and the manufacturing of\r\nstage machinery, likewise, underwent all the improvements of which by\r\ntheir nature they are susceptible. For, in the first place, it is not\r\neasy to suppose, that a people, so fastidious as were the Athenians,\r\nwould have tolerated in the theatre displays of ignorance and want of\r\nskill which everywhere else they are known to have overwhelmed with\r\ncontempt and derision; more especially as, in the first place, the\r\nlandscapes and objects represented were usually those with which they\r\nwere most familiar, though the fancy of the poet sometimes ventured to\r\ntransport them to the most elevated and inaccessible recesses of Mount\r\nCaucasus, to the summit of the celestial Olympos, to the palaces and\r\nharems of Persia, to the wilds of the Tauric Chersonese,[909] or even to\r\nthe dim and dreary regions of the dead. The names, nevertheless, of few\r\nscene-painters, besides Agatharchos,[910] have come down to us, though\r\nit is known, that, in their own day, they sometimes divided with the\r\npoet the admiration of the audience, and, on other occasions, enabled\r\npoets of inferior merit to bear away the prize from their betters.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 909:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Their art, however, would appear to have sprung\r\nfrom that of the rhapsodists, who chanted in temples, during religious\r\nfestivals, and afterwards in the theatres, the heroic lays of Greece. To\r\na certain extent, indeed, the rhapsodist was himself an actor. His art\r\nrequired him to enter deeply into the spirit of the poetry he recited,\r\nto suit to the passion brought into play the modulations and inflexions\r\nof his voice, his tone, his looks, his gesture, so as vividly to paint\r\nto the imagination the picture designed by the poet, and sway the whole\r\ntheatre by the powerful wand of sympathy through all the gradations of\r\nsorrow, indignation, and joy.[913] By some writers, accordingly, the\r\nrhapsodist is apparently confounded with the actor, that is, he is\r\nconsidered an actor of epics,[914] though in reality his imitations of\r\ncharacter were partial and imperfect.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 912:\r\n\r\n  Vid.

These persons, though for\r\nthe most part held in little estimation, were yet somewhat more\r\nrespectable than at Rome, where to appear on the stage was\r\ninfamous.[917] Like the rhapsodists, they generally led a wandering\r\nlife, sometimes appearing at Athens,[918] sometimes at Corinth, or\r\nSicyon, or Epidauros, or Thebes, after the fashion approved among the\r\nstrollers of our own day. In the course of these wanderings they now and\r\nthen fell in with rare adventures, as in the case of that company of\r\ncomedians which, on returning from Messenia towards the Isthmus, was met\r\nby king Cleomenes and the Spartan army near Megalopolis.[919] To exhibit\r\nthe superiority of his power and his contempt for the enemy, Cleomenes\r\nthrew up, probably with turf and boards, a temporary theatre, where he\r\nand his army sat all day enjoying the jokes and wild merriment of the\r\nstage, after which, he bestowed, as a prize, upon the principal\r\nperformers, the sum of forty minæ, or about one hundred and sixty pounds\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 915:\r\n\r\n  Philost.

Vit. Apoll.\r\n  Tyan. v. 9. Cf. Luc. de Saltat. § 27. A taste for the amusements of\r\n  the Grecian stage was diffused far and wide through the ancient world,\r\n  so that we find the princes of Persia and Armenia not only enjoying\r\n  the representation of Greek tragedies, but themselves, likewise, in\r\n  some instances, aspiring to rival the dramatic poets of Hellas. Thus\r\n  Artavasdes, the Armenian prince, is said to have written tragedies, as\r\n  well as histories and orations, some of which still existed in the age\r\n  of Plutarch. The Parthian court was engaged in beholding the Bacchæ of\r\n  Euripides, in which Jason of Tralles was the principal performer, when\r\n  Sillaces brought in the head of Marcus Crassus, upon which both king\r\n  and nobles delivered themselves up to immoderate joy, and the actor,\r\n  seizing upon the Roman’s head, exchanged the part of Pentheus for that\r\n  of his mother, who appears upon the stage bearing a bleeding head upon\r\n  her thyrsus; for this he received a present of a talent from the\r\n  king.—Plut. Crass. § 33. Polyæan. vii. 41. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 919:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Cleom. § 12.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAbout this period, however, it was usual for the armies of Greece,\r\nrepublican as well as royal, to be followed by companies of strollers,\r\njugglers, dancing girls, and musicians.[920] Even in the army of\r\nAlexander, when proceeding on the Persian expedition, the “flatterers of\r\nDionysos”[921] were not forgotten; in fact, the son of Philip set a high\r\nvalue upon the performances of these gentlemen, and with truly royal\r\nmunificence allowed them to enjoy their full share of the plunder of the\r\nEast. Thus, when Nicocreon, king of Salamis, and Pasicrates, king of\r\nSoli,[922] played the part of Choregi in Cyprus, in getting up certain\r\ntragedies there performed for the amusement of Alexander, and the\r\nactors, Thessalos, and Athenodoros the Athenian, contended for the\r\nprize; he was piqued at the victory of the Athenian, and, though he\r\ncommended the judges for bestowing the prize on him whom they regarded\r\nas the best performer, said, he would have given a part of his kingdom\r\nrather than have beheld Thessalos overcome by a rival.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 920:\r\n\r\n  Plut. ubi supra.\r\n\r\nFootnote 921:\r\n\r\n  Διονυσοκόλακες. Athen. vi. 56.\r\n\r\nFootnote 922:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Alex. § 29.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when Athenodoros was fined by his countrymen for absenting\r\nhimself from Athens during the Dionysiac festival, evidently contrary to\r\nthe statutes in that case made and provided, Alexander paid the fine for\r\nhis humble friend, though he refused to make application to the people\r\nfor its remission.\r\n\r\nAn anecdote related of Lycon of Scarphe, also shows the high value set\r\nby the Macedonian prince upon the amusements of the stage, and the\r\ninfluence exercised over his mind by the Dionysiac artificers, though,\r\naccording to Antiphanes, he wanted the taste to discriminate between a\r\ngood play and a bad one. The Scarpheote being one day in want of money,\r\nas actors sometimes are, introduced into the piece he was performing a\r\nline of his own making, beseeching the conqueror to bestow on him ten\r\ntalents; Alexander, amused by his extravagance, or captivated perhaps,\r\nby the flattery which accompanied it, at once granted his request, and\r\nthus upwards of two thousand four hundred pounds of the public money\r\nwere expended for the momentary gratification of a prince.[923]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 923:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Alex. § 29.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe philosophers, almost of necessity, thought and spoke of these\r\nwandering performers with extreme contempt. Plato observes, that they\r\nwent about from city to city collecting together thoughtless crowds,\r\nand, by their beautiful, sonorous, and persuasive voices, converting\r\nrepublics into tyrannies and aristocracies. Aristotle endeavoured to\r\naccount for their evil character and agency.[924] They were worthless,\r\nhe says, because of all men they profited least by the lessons of reason\r\nand philosophy, their whole lives being consumed by the study of their\r\nprofessional arts, or passed in intemperance and difficulties.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 924:\r\n\r\n  Prob. xxx. 10. They were likewise corrupted by their profession,\r\n  since, in female parts, they frequently indulged in immodest gestures,\r\n  as is particularly related of Callipedes. Id. Poet. v. 2. Cf.

And as in\r\nevery thing the Greeks aimed at excellence and distinction, so even here\r\nwe find that there was a contest between the poets who wrote the comic\r\nsongs sung by these humble performers from their waggons.[926]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 925:\r\n\r\n  Occasionally, as among ourselves, jugglers were introduced upon the\r\n  stage, swallowing swords and performing other fantastic tricks.—Plut.\r\n  Lycurg. § 19.\r\n\r\nFootnote 926:\r\n\r\n  Schol. Aristoph. Eq. 545.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe various classes of actors known to the ancients were numerous. Among\r\nthe lower grades were the Magodos, and the Lysiodos,[927] who though\r\nconfounded by some, appear clearly to have been distinct; the former\r\npersonating both male and female characters; the latter female\r\ncharacters only, though disguised in male costume. But the songs, and\r\nevery other characteristic of their performances, were the same. The\r\nspirit of the coarse satirical farces they acted forbids my explaining\r\ntheir nature fully.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 927:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iv. 80. v. 47. vi. 61. Cf. Eustath. ad Odyss. ψ. p. 106, sub\r\n  fin.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere were even several authors who attained a “bad eminence” in this\r\ndepartment of literature, which especially affected the Ionic dialect,\r\nas Alexander, the Ætolian,[928] Pyretos of Miletos, a city noted for its\r\ndissolute characters, and Alexos, who obtained on this account an\r\nopprobrious sobriquet. The most remarkable, however, of this vicious\r\nbrood would appear to have been Sotades[929] the Maronite, and his son\r\nApollonios who wrote a work on his father’s poems. Sotades was probably\r\nthe original imitated by Pietro Aretino, who obtained in modern times a\r\nlike reputation, though timely penitence may have snatched him from a\r\nsimilar end. The ancient libeller, enacting the part of Thersites,\r\nfastened with peculiar delight on the vices of princes, not from\r\naversion to their manners, but because such scandal paved the way to\r\nnotoriety. Thus at Alexandria, he covered Lysimachos with obloquy,\r\nwhich, when at the court of Lysimachos, he heaped upon Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphos. His punishment, however, exceeded the measure of his\r\noffences. Being overtaken in the island of Caunos by Patrocles, one of\r\nPtolemy’s generals, the obsequious mercenary caused him to be enclosed\r\nin a leaden box and cast into the sea.[930]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 928:\r\n\r\n  Suid. v. φλύακες, t. ii. p. 1073. b.\r\n\r\nFootnote 929:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Fabric. Bib. Græc. ii. p. 495, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 930:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 13.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Magodos, then, was a wandering farce actor, not unlike the tumbling\r\nmountebanks one sometimes sees in France and southern Europe. He\r\ntravelled about with an apparatus of drums, cymbals, and female\r\ndisguises, sometimes impersonating women, sometimes adulterers or the\r\nmean servants of vice; and the style of his dancing and performances\r\ncorresponded with the low walk he selected, being wholly destitute of\r\nbeauty or decorum. It seems necessary, therefore, to adopt the opinion\r\nof Aristoxenos, who considered the art of the Hilarodos as a serious\r\nimitation of tragedy; that of the Magodos as a comic parody, brought\r\ndown to the level of the grossly vulgar. The latter art would appear to\r\nhave derived its name from the charms, spells, or magical songs chanted\r\nby the mountebanks who likewise pretended to develope the secrets of\r\npharmaceutics.\r\n\r\nSuperior in every way to the Magodos and Lysiodos was the\r\nHilarodos,[931] who, though a wandering singer like the Italians and\r\nSavoyards of modern Europe, affected no little state, and was evidently\r\ntreated with some respect. His costume, in conformity with the popular\r\ntaste, displayed considerable magnificence, consisting of a golden\r\ncrown, white stole and costly sandals, though in earlier ages he\r\nappeared in shoes. He was usually accompanied by a youth or maiden who\r\ntouched the lyre as he sung. The style of his performances was decorous\r\nand manly. When a crown was given him in token of approbation by the\r\naudience, it was bestowed on the Hilarodos himself, not on the musician.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 931:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Athen. iv. 57.

They were called Deikelistæ,[932] and their style of\r\nperforming showed the little value set upon the drama at Sparta. The\r\npoetry of the piece, if poetry it could be called, was extempore and of\r\nthe rudest description, and the characters were altogether conformable.\r\nSometimes the interest of the play turned upon a man robbing an orchard,\r\nor on the broken Greek of an outlandish physician, whom people respected\r\nfor his gibberish. This weakness, prevalent of course at Athens also, is\r\nwittily satirised by Alexis in his Female Opium Eater.\r\n\r\n                           “Now if a native\r\n           Doctor prescribe, ‘Give him a porringer\r\n           Of ptisan in the morning,’ we despise him.\r\n           But in some _brogue_ disguised ’tis admirable.\r\n           Thus he who speaks of _Beet_ is slighted, while\r\n           We prick our ears if he but mention _Bate_,\r\n           As if _Bate_ knew some virtue not in _Beet_.”[933]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 932:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

Athen. xiv. 15.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Deikelistæ, however, were not confined to Laconia, but, under\r\nvarious names were known in most other parts of Greece. Thus, at Sicyon,\r\nthey obtained the appellation of Phallophori, elsewhere they were called\r\nAutocabdali, or Improvisator; while in Italy, (that is, among the Greek\r\ncolonists,[934]) they were known by the name of Phlyakes.[935] By the\r\ncommon people they were called the wise men (σοφίσται), upon the same\r\nprinciple that actors in France are known by the name of _artistes_. The\r\nThebans, renowned for the havoc they made in the language of Greece,\r\ndenominated them the Voluntaries, alluding proleptically perhaps to the\r\n“voluntary principle.” Semos, the Delian, draws an amusing picture of\r\nthese Improvisatori. Those performers, he says, who are called\r\nAutocabdali made their appearance on the stage, crowned with ivy, and\r\npoured forth their verse extempore. The name of Iambi was afterwards\r\nbestowed, both on them and their poems. Another class who were called\r\nIthyphalli,[936] wore those masks, which on the stage were appropriated\r\nto drunkards, with crowns of ivy and flowered gloves upon their hands.\r\nTheir chitons were striped with white, and over these, bound by a girdle\r\nat the loins, they wore a Tarentine pelisse descending to the ankle.\r\nThey entered upon the stage by the great door appropriated to royal\r\npersonages, and, advancing in silence across the stage, turned towards\r\nthe audience and exclaimed,—\r\n\r\n                   “Make way there, a wide space\r\n                   Yield to the god;\r\n                   For Dionysos has a mind to walk\r\n                   Bolt upright through your midst.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 934:\r\n\r\n  Among the mimics of this part of Italy, the most celebrated was Cleon,\r\n  surnamed the Mimaulos, who dispensed with the use of a mask.—Athen. x.\r\n  78.\r\n\r\nFootnote 935:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 15.

Their costume was the caunacè. Of these actors,\r\nsome entered through the side-passages, others through the central door,\r\nadvancing with measured tread, and saying,—\r\n\r\n                “Bacchos, to thee our muse belongs,\r\n                  Of simple chant, and varied lays;\r\n                Nor fit for virgin ears our songs,\r\n                  Nor handed down from ancient days:\r\n                Fresh flows the strain we pour to thee,\r\n                Patron of joy and minstrelsy!”\r\n\r\nAfter which, skipping forward, they made a halt and showered their\r\nsarcasms indiscriminately on whomsoever they pleased, while the leader\r\nof the troop moved slowly about, his face bedaubed with soot.[937]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 937:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 16.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe superior classes of performers, whether actors or musicians, seem to\r\nhave been held in much estimation, and to have been still more\r\nextravagantly paid than in our own day. Thus Amœbæos, the Citharœdos,\r\nwho lived near the Odeion at Athens, received, but at what period of the\r\nrepublic is not known, an Attic talent a day, as often as he played in\r\npublic.[938] Music, however, was always in high estimation in Greece,\r\nwhere the greatest men, though they did not seek to rival regular\r\nprofessors in skill, yet learned to amuse their leisure with it. Thus\r\nthe Homeric Achilles plays on the lyre, the sounds of which could not\r\nonly cure diseases of the mind but of the body. A similar belief existed\r\namong the Israelites, as we learn from the example of Saul.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 938:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 17.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThough talent must have been always respected in an actor, it appears to\r\nme that anciently they made comparatively little figure, while there\r\nwere great poets to excite admiration. But, afterwards, when dramatic\r\nliterature had sunk very low, the actor usurped the consideration due to\r\nthe poet, as has long been the case in this country. They then contended\r\nfor the prize in the tragic contests,[939] and began to entertain a high\r\nopinion of their own merits. In fact, the ignorant being better\r\ncalculated to feel than to judge, the actors often obtained the first\r\nprizes in the games, and were held in higher estimation than the poets\r\nthemselves.[940]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 939:\r\n\r\n  Aristot.

Rhet. iii. 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThus persuaded of their own importance, they gradually exercised over\r\nthe poor devils who composed plays for them, much the same tyranny as\r\nthat in our own age complained of by the poetical servants of the\r\ntheatre. That is, they despotically interfered with the framing of the\r\nplot, with the succession of the scenes, and procured episodes to be\r\nintroduced, in order that they might show off their peculiar abilities.\r\nThis is evident from a passage in Aristotle’s Politics,[941] where he\r\nobserves that the celebrated actor Theodoros would allow no inferior\r\nperformer to appear before him on the stage, knowing the force of first\r\nimpressions; from which it is evident that the author was compelled to\r\nyield to his caprice.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 941:\r\n\r\n  Polit. vii. 17.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAntiquity has preserved the names of many celebrated actors, of whom\r\nseveral played a conspicuous though sometimes a dishonourable part in\r\nthe great theatre of the world. Thus Aristodemos, who performed the\r\nfirst character alternately with Theodoros, became afterwards a traitor\r\nand betrayed the state to Philip. Such too was the case with Philocrates\r\nand Æschines, both actors,[942] and both rogues. Satyros, a comedian of\r\nthe same period, appears to have been a man of high character and\r\nhonour, who in consequence obtained the friendship of Demosthenes. But\r\nthe Garrick of that age seems to have been Theocrines,[943] who by many,\r\nhowever, is supposed to have afterwards degenerated into a sycophant.\r\nCallipedes is chiefly known to us from the anecdote which describes the\r\ncheck his vanity received from Agesilaos. Having acquired great\r\nreputation as a tragic actor, he appears to have considered himself as\r\nequal at least to any king, and therefore, meeting one day with\r\nAgesilaos, he ostentatiously put himself forward, mingled with the\r\ncourtiers and took much pains to attract his notice. Finding all these\r\nefforts useless, his pride was wounded, and going up directly to the\r\nSpartan, he said,\r\n\r\n“Dost thou not know me, king?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” replied Agesilaos, “art thou not Callipedes, the\r\nstage-buffoon?”[944]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 942:\r\n\r\n  Dem. de Fal.

Œagros obtained celebrity in the part of Niobe,[946] in the\r\ntragedy of Æschylus or Sophocles; and Aristophanes enumerates among the\r\npleasures of Dicasts the power, should such an actor appear before them\r\nin a court of justice, of requiring him by way of pleading his own\r\ncause, to give them a few choice speeches of his favourite tragic queen.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 945:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

Dem. § 28. Vit. x. Orat. 8. Another actor obtained the name of\r\n  the Partridge. Athen. iii. 82.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPolos appears to have risen speedily to that eminence which he\r\nmaintained to the last. A striking anecdote is related of the means by\r\nwhich he worked upon his own feelings, in order the more vehemently to\r\nstir those of his audience. On one occasion,[948] having to perform the\r\npart of Electra, he took along with him to the theatre an urn containing\r\nthe ashes of a beloved son, whom he had recently lost, and thus, instead\r\nof shedding, under the mask of the heroic princess, feigned tears over\r\nthe supposed remains of Orestes, he sprinkled the urn which he bore upon\r\nthe stage with the dews of genuine and deep sorrow. He eclipsed in\r\nreputation all the actors of his time, and was in tragedy what\r\nTheocrines, in the preceding age, had been in comedy. His salary,\r\naccordingly, was very great, amounting at one time to half a talent per\r\nday, out of which, to be sure, he was required to pay the third actor.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 948:\r\n\r\n  Aulus Gellius, vii. 5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHe must have led, moreover, a life of much temperance, otherwise he\r\nwould scarcely have been able to accomplish what is related of him by\r\nPhilochoros, who says, that, at seventy years of age, a little before\r\nhis death, he performed the principal parts of eight tragedies in four\r\ndays. His devotion to his art did not, however, carry him so far as that\r\nof the comic poets, Philemon and Alexis, who breathed their last upon\r\nthe stage at the moment that the crown of victory was placed upon their\r\nheads, and so were literally dismissed for the last time from the scene\r\namidst the shouts and acclamations of the admiring multitude.[949] But\r\nthe passion of the Greeks for the arts of imitation did not confine\r\nitself to the enacting of human character and human feelings. Every\r\nspecies of mimicry found its patrons among them. There were, for\r\nexample, persons who, by whistling, could imitate the notes of the\r\nnightingale; and Agesilaos, being once invited to witness the\r\nperformances of one of these artists, replied somewhat contemptuously,\r\n“I have heard the nightingale herself.”[950] Others, as Parmenion, could\r\ncounterfeit to perfection the grunt of a pig,[951] though it is\r\nprobable, that actors of smaller dimensions were called upon to perform\r\nin the comedy of Aristophanes, where the Megarean[952] brings on the\r\nstage his daughters in a sack, and disposes of them as porkers, having\r\nfirst carefully instructed them in the proper style of squeaking. Other\r\nactors obtained celebrity[953] through their power of imitating by their\r\nvoice the grating or rumbling of wheels, the creaking of axletrees, the\r\nwhistling of winds, the blasts of trumpets, the modulations of flutes,\r\nor pipes, or the sounds of other instruments. It was customary, too,\r\namong this class of performers, to mimic, doubtless, in pastoral scenes,\r\nthe bleating of sheep, and the bark of the shepherd’s dog, the neighing\r\nof horses, and the deep bellowing of bulls. They could imitate,\r\nmoreover, but by what means is uncertain, the pattering of hail-storms,\r\nthe dash and breaking of water in rivers or seas, with other natural\r\nphenomena. It was customary, likewise, as in modern times, to introduce\r\nboats and galleys rowed along the mimic waters of the stage, an example\r\nof which occurs on an Etruscan Chalcidone, where we behold a little\r\nvessel of extraordinary form, with a mariner at bow and stern, paddled\r\nalong a bank adorned with flowers, while on a platform, occupying the\r\nboat’s waist, two naked dancers are exhibiting their saltatorial\r\npowers.[954]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 949:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

This\r\n  philosopher, it is clear, entertained a less elevated idea of art than\r\n  some modern writers, who define it as follows: “Art is a\r\n  representation (μίμησις), i. e. an energy by means of which a subject\r\n  becomes an object,”—(Müller, cited by Mr. Donaldson, Theatre of the\r\n  Greeks, p. 4,)—in other words, by which a nominative becomes an\r\n  accusative.\r\n\r\nFootnote 954:\r\n\r\n  Mus. Cortonens. tab. 60.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nVery singular figures were also introduced upon the stage, as wasps,\r\nfrogs, and birds, of sufficiently large dimensions to be enacted by men;\r\nand still stranger personages occasionally made their appearance, as\r\nwhere, in a kind of practical parody of the story of Andromeda,[955] a\r\nwhale emerges on the sea beach to snap off an old woman. In another\r\ndrama the transformation of Argos was represented, after which this\r\nluckless male duenna strutted like a peacock before the audience. Io,\r\nmoreover, was changed into a cow, and Euippe, in Euripides, into a mare.\r\nWhat there was peculiar in the appearance of Amymone it is not easy to\r\nconjecture; but she was, possibly, represented in the act of withdrawing\r\nthe trident of Poseidon from the rock, from which gushed forth three\r\nfountains. The rivers, and mountains, and cities introduced[956] were,\r\ndoubtless, personifications, such as we still find in many works of art.\r\nThe giants were simply, in all probability, huge figures of men, made to\r\nstalk about the stage, like elephants, with an actor in each leg; and\r\nthe Indians, Tritons, Gorgons, Centaurs, with other personages of\r\nterrible or fantastic aspect, owed their existence, perhaps, to masks,\r\nif we may so speak, representing the whole figures.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 955:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

Here and there, through these\r\npiles of drapery, a mask with ruddy pendant nose, like the tail of a\r\nlobster, peered forth, and a human voice was heard chanting in richest\r\ncadence and modulation the lively anapæsts of the chorus.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 957:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 142.\r\n\r\nFootnote 958:\r\n\r\n  Vid.

Sometimes, he observes, the actor was required to\r\nimitate a woman, (though this task often devolved upon eunuchs,) whether\r\nyoung or old, reviling her husband, railing at and expressing contempt\r\nfor the gods, either puffed up by the supposed stableness of her\r\nfelicity, or stung to desperation by the severity of her misfortunes and\r\nsorrows. Other female characters were to be represented, toiling, or in\r\nlove, or in the pangs of labour; which shows that there was scarcely an\r\nact or passage in human life not occasionally imitated on the stage.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 960:\r\n\r\n  De Rep. t. vi. p. 125.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSlaves of course performed an important part in the mimic world of the\r\ntheatre; and with these, Plato, by some unaccountable association of\r\nideas, classes smiths, and madmen, and vagabonds, and low artificers of\r\nevery kind, and the rowers of galleys, and rogues, and cowards, below\r\nwhich his imagination could discover nothing in human nature.\r\n\r\nBut it was these very characters, with their low wit, buffoonery, and\r\nappropriate actions, that constituted the most effective materials of\r\nthe comic poet, whose creed was, that\r\n\r\n             Les fous sont ici-bas pour nos menus plaisirs.\r\n\r\nThey accordingly hesitated at no degree of grotesque buffoonery and\r\nextravagance, introducing not only low sausage-sellers with their trays\r\nof black-puddings and chitterlings suspended on their paunches,[961] and\r\ndrunkards lisping, hiccuping, and reeling about the stage,[962] but even\r\nlibertines and profligates carrying on their intrigues in the view of\r\nthe spectators. An example of this kind of scene occurs on an Etruscan\r\nbronze seal dug up near Cortona, which represents an adulterer in\r\nconference with his mistress, together with the Leno who brought them\r\ntogether.[963]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 961:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

It\r\nundoubtedly appears, however, to have arisen amid the festivities of the\r\nvintage, when, after the grapes were brought home and pressed and the\r\nprincipal labours of the season concluded,[964] the rustics delivered\r\nthemselves up to wild joy and merriment, chanting hymns and performing\r\ndances in honour of Dionysos, the protecting god of the vine. At first\r\nthe number of the persons engaged in these dances could not have been\r\nfixed, since it is probable that all the vintagers, both male and\r\nfemale, joined in the sports, as they had previously joined in the\r\nlabour. And this free and unformal character the Dithyrambic or\r\nDionysiac chorus must have preserved, as long as it remained a mere\r\nvillage pastime. But when afterwards, advancing from one step to\r\nanother, it assumed something of an artificial form and several\r\nchorusses arose which contended with each other for a prize, the\r\nperformers must have undergone some kind of training,[965] both in\r\nsinging and dancing, and then the number of the individuals constituting\r\nthe chorus was possibly fixed. There appears to be some reason for\r\nthinking, that these exhibitions were more ancient than the congregation\r\nof the Athenians in one city, and that originally every tribe had its\r\nown chorus,[966] since we find that afterwards, when all the inhabitants\r\nof Attica came to regard themselves as one people, the Choreutæ were\r\nchosen from every tribe five.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 964:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Dissert. xxi. p. 249.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBy what gradations, however, the village chorus was transformed into the\r\nDithyrambic, the Dithyrambic into the Satyric, and the Satyric again\r\ninto the Tragic, it now appears impossible to ascertain; but it seems to\r\nbe quite clear,[967] that in many ancient tragedies the number of the\r\nchorus was fifty,[968] as, for example, in the “Judgment of the Arms,”\r\nby Æschylus, in which silver-footed Thetis appeared upon the stage\r\naccompanied by a train of fifty Nereids.[969] Again, according to\r\ncertain ancient authors,[970] in the Eumenides of Æschylus, the chorus\r\nof Furies at first amounted to fifty, which, rushing tumultuously, with\r\nfrightful gestures and horrid masks,[971] into the orchestra, struck so\r\ngreat a terror into the people, particularly the women[972] and\r\nchildren, that their number was afterwards reduced by law. I am aware\r\nthat several distinguished scholars think very differently on this\r\nsubject; some maintaining, that the chorus of Furies always consisted of\r\nfifteen, while others reduce their number to three. But, though both\r\nthese opinions have been supported with much learning and ingenuity, it\r\nseems difficult to admit either the one or the other. In the first\r\nplace, since every thing connected with the stage was in a state of\r\nperpetual fluctuation, since the masks and costume were repeatedly\r\naltered, since the number of the actors was augmented, since almost\r\nevery arrangement of the theatre, and every characteristic of the\r\npoetry, underwent numerous modifications; the chorus, also, it is\r\nprobable, submitted to the same alterations or reforms till it settled\r\nin that tetragonal figure[973] and determinate number which it\r\nafterwards preserved, as long as the legitimate drama existed in Greece.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 967:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 108.

Acharn. 209.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn one point of view the history of the chorus is extremely remarkable.\r\nAt first, and for some time, it constituted in itself the whole of the\r\nspectacle exhibited at the Dionysiac festivals, where its songs and\r\ndances, accompanied by such rude music as the times afforded, satisfied\r\nthe demands of the popular taste, and were consequently supposed to be\r\neverything that the god required. By degrees, as experience suggested\r\nimprovements either in the music, in the manner of dancing, or in the\r\nmaterials and composition of the odes, the movements, singing, and\r\nappearance of the Chorus, assumed a more artificial form, which was\r\nnecessarily carried forward many steps in the career of amelioration by\r\nthe institution of rival bodies of Choreutæ, who, from the natural\r\nprinciple of emulation, endeavoured to excel each other. Next, a\r\ndetached member of its own body, mounted on a table, enacted the part of\r\na stranger or messenger come to announce something which it imported the\r\nservants of Dionysos to know. This table was doubtless placed directly\r\nin front of the altar of Bacchos, on the steps of which the leader of\r\nthe chorus was probably mounted in after ages, to hold communication\r\nwith the stranger; and, as this altar ripened through many gradations\r\ninto the Thymele, so the aforesaid table rose through innumerable\r\nchanges into the Logeion. It may be remarked, moreover, that the slope\r\nof a hill,[974] when any such existed near the village, would naturally\r\nbe chosen on such occasions to afford the peasants an opportunity of\r\nstanding behind each other on ascending levels, and thus, without\r\ninconvenience, beholding the show; and where such natural aid did not\r\npresent itself, they probably threw up embankments of turf in the\r\nsemicircular form, which experience proved to be most convenient, and,\r\nout of this rude contrivance, grew those vast and magnificent\r\nstructures, which afterwards constituted one of the noblest ornaments of\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 974:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Scalig. Poet, i. 21. Leroy, Ruines des plus beaux Monumens de la\r\n  Grèce, p. 14.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe single actor, detached in the manner we have said from the Chorus,\r\nspeedily acquired greater importance, and the aid of poetry was called\r\nin to frame and adorn his recitals; and as, during the songs and dances\r\nof the Chorus, he necessarily remained idle, the idea soon suggested\r\nitself that a second actor[975] would be an improvement, upon which\r\ndialogue and the regular drama sprang into existence.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 975:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Somewhat to assist the eye and memory, the whole pattern, as it\r\nwere, of the dance seems to have been chalked out on the floor of the\r\norchestra;[976] while the greatest possible pains were taken in drilling\r\nthe Choreutæ to open, file off, and wheel through their labyrinthine\r\nevolutions, without confusion. The manner in which these persons usually\r\nentered the orchestra, that is to say, ranged in a square body, three in\r\nfront and five deep, or five in front and three deep, has suggested to\r\nsome the notion that they represented a military Lochos;[977] but\r\nbesides that this is inconsistent with their Dionysiac origin, they did\r\nnot always preserve this arrangement, but, on some occasions, came\r\nrushing in confusedly, while on others they traversed the Parodos in\r\nIndian file.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 976:\r\n\r\n  This, however, I merely conjecture from the practice of marking with\r\n  lines the station of the chorus.

Here, also, stood the\r\nRhabduchi,[979] or vergers of the theatre, whose business it was to see\r\nthat order was preserved among the spectators.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 978:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

They appear to have conceived the idea\r\nof representing almost every passion and action in human life by that\r\ncombination of movements and gestures which the term pantomime, borrowed\r\nfrom their own language, expresses much better than our word\r\ndancing.[981] A taste, in some respects similar, still prevails among\r\nthe Orientals, whose Ghawazi and Bayadères, though relying rather upon\r\nroutine and impulse than on the resources of art, perform at festivals\r\nand marriages, and before the ladies of the harem, little love-pieces\r\nand pastoral scenes, which evidently belong to the class of mimetic\r\ndances described by ancient authors.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 980:\r\n\r\n  See Cahusac, Traité Historique de la Dance, ii. i. t. i. p. 61, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 981:\r\n\r\n  It is said that certain ancient poets were called orchestic,—as\r\n  Thespis, Phrynichos, Pratinas, Carcinos,—not only because they adapted\r\n  the subjects of their pieces to the dances of the chorusses, but,\r\n  also, because they instructed in dancing the chorusses of other\r\n  dramatic writers. Athen. i. 39. The above poet, Carcinos, was likewise\r\n  celebrated for being the father of three sons who danced in the tragic\r\n  chorusses, and, from their extremely diminutive stature, obtained the\r\n  name of Quails. Schol. Aristoph. Pac. 761.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn tragedy, such as it existed in the polished ages of Greece, the\r\nmovements were slow and solemn, and, no doubt, full of dignity. The\r\nspirit of comedy required brisk and lively, and frequently tolerated,\r\naudaciously wanton dances; while the Chorus of the Satyric Drama would\r\nappear to have been rude and clownish rather than indecent, indulging in\r\ngrotesque movements, ludicrous and extravagant gestures, and that rustic\r\nand farcical style of mimicry which may be supposed to have prevailed\r\namong the rough peasantry of Hellas.\r\n\r\nIn classing the various dances, it will, perhaps, be sufficient if we\r\ndivide them into lively and serious,[982] joining with the latter all\r\nsuch as attempted to embody a symbol or an allegory.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 982:\r\n\r\n  Hesych. v. ἐμμέλεια. Sch. Aristoph. Nub. 532. Poll. iv. 99. Athen.\r\n  xiv. 27, seq. Luc. de Saltat. § 22. 26. Plut. Symposiac. ix. 15. 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn certain dramas of Phrynichos the Chorus represented a company of\r\nwrestlers,[983] who contrived by the quick, flexible, and varied\r\nmovements of the dance, to imitate all the accidents of the palæstra.\r\nSometimes they personated a party of scouts in the active look-out for\r\nthe enemy, each with his right hand curved above the brow: this was one\r\nform of the Scops.[984] On other occasions the dancer mimicked the\r\nhabits of the Scops, or mocking-owl, twirling about the head, and\r\nappearing to be absorbed in an ecstasy of imitation, until taken by the\r\nfowler. The performance of a piece like this, by a numerous Chorus,\r\nsometimes breaking off into a brisk gallopade, sometimes maintaining the\r\nsame position, jigging, pirouetting, and ducking the crest, must, no\r\ndoubt, have appeared infinitely comic; and yet it could have been\r\nnothing in comparison with the Morphasmos,[985] in which, not the\r\ncharacteristic peculiarities of a single owl, but those of the whole\r\nanimal creation were “taken off.” Thus we may suppose that the Hegemon\r\nof the Chorus started as a baboon, his next-door neighbour as a hog, a\r\nthird as a lion, a fourth as an ass, and so on, each man accommodating\r\nhis voice to the character he had, pro tempore, assumed, and gibbering,\r\ngrunting, roaring, braying, as he leaped, or gamboled, or bounded, or\r\nscampered about the orchestra. Anon the frisky foresters were\r\ntransformed into slaves, who would seem to have been introduced to the\r\naudience pounding something, perhaps onions and garlick, in a mortar.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 983:\r\n\r\n  Suid. v.

Not,\r\nperhaps, un-akin to this, were those three frenzied dances, alluded to\r\nrather than described by the ancients,—that is to say, the\r\nThermaustris,[987] which seems to have consisted of a series of violent\r\nbounds, like the performances of the Hurons and Iroquois;[988] the\r\nMongas, which, from the name, probably represented the friskings and\r\ncaracollings of a jackass; and the Kernophoros,[989] or dance of the\r\nfirst-fruits, wherein the Chorus appeared upon the stage, some bearing\r\ncensers, others fruit-baskets, evidently in a character resembling that\r\nof Bacchanals.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 986:\r\n\r\n  Poll. vi. 99.\r\n\r\nFootnote 987:\r\n\r\n  Pfeiffer.

Poll. iv. 104.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo this species of dance belonged, also, the Hecaterides, in which the\r\nperformer interpreted his desires or passion by furious gestures of the\r\nhands. The Eclactisma was a female dance,[990] requiring the exertion of\r\ngreat force and agility, its characteristics consisting in flinging the\r\nheels backwards above the level of the shoulders. Corresponding, in some\r\nmeasure, to the Eclactisma, was the Skistas,[991] in which the dancer\r\nbounded aloft, crossing his legs several times while in the air. There\r\nwas a dance, evidently of a very extraordinary description, which they\r\nperformed to an air called Thyrocopicon,[992] or “knocking at doors,”\r\npossibly representing the frolics of such wild youths as anticipated the\r\nscape-graces of our own day. The Mothon was a loose dance, common among\r\nsailors; the Baukismos, Bactriasmos, Apokinos, Aposeisis, and\r\nSobas,[993] were laughable, but lewd dances,[994] resembling the Bolero\r\nand Fandango of the Spaniards.[995]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 990:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 10. 2.

The Deimalea was a Laconian dance performed by Satyrs and\r\nSeileni, skipping and jumping about in a circle.[997] Another Spartan\r\ndance[998] was the Bryallika, of a ludicrous and licentious character,\r\nperformed by women in grotesque masks, whence a courtezan at Sparta was\r\ndenominated, Bryallika. The name of Hypogypones,[999] was bestowed on\r\ncertain performers who imitated old men, flourishing their sticks about\r\nthe stage, as we are informed they did in the play of Simermnos.[1000]\r\nAkin in spirit to these were the Gypones,[1001] who made their\r\nappearance in transparent Tarentine robes, and mounted on stilts\r\nprobably in the form of goats’ feet, to give them a resemblance to the\r\nÆgipanes, worshipped as gods of the woods. A peculiar dance in honour of\r\nArtemis took its rise in the village of Carya in Laconia, where its\r\ninvention was attributed to Castor and Polydeukes. No description of it,\r\nso far as I know, has come down to us; but the maidens by whom it was\r\nperformed probably bore, and steadied with one hand, a basket of flowers\r\non their heads, thus forming the model of those architectural figures,\r\nstill from them called Caryatides.[1002] The representation of this\r\nperformance was, doubtless, a favourite subject among Spartan artists or\r\nsuch as were employed by the Spartans, as may perhaps be fairly inferred\r\nfrom the circumstance, that the device on the ring, which, in return for\r\na comb, was presented by Clearchus to Ctesias to be shown to his friends\r\nat Lacedæmon, was a dance of Caryatides.[1003]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 996:\r\n\r\n  Id. ib.\r\n\r\nFootnote 997:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 104.\r\n\r\nFootnote 998:\r\n\r\n  See Müller. ii. 354.\r\n\r\nFootnote 999:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 104.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1000:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

The story told in this mimetic performance\r\nreferred to remote antiquity, and was both curiously and elaborately\r\nintricate, comprehending all the adventures of Bacchos and his merry\r\ncrew during the Indian expedition, and assuming towards the conclusion a\r\ntragical form, developing the sad story of Pentheus.[1005]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1004:\r\n\r\n  Duport. ad Theoph.

Tell me where.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1009:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 27.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, however, seem to have imagined that there was nothing in\r\nnature which might not be imitated in the dance, by the turns and mazes\r\nof which they accordingly sought to represent the movements of the\r\nstars.[1010] A similar fancy, if Lucian may be credited, possessed the\r\nIndian Yoghis, who every morning and evening before their doors saluted\r\nthe sun, at his rising and setting, with a dance resembling his\r\nown,[1011] which, as that luminary no otherwise dances than by turning\r\non its axis, must have been a performance resembling that of the\r\nwhirling derwishes, whose broad symbolical petticoats are meant, I\r\npresume, to represent the disk of the sun. But the dance most difficult\r\nof comprehension is that upon which they bestowed the name of κόσμου\r\nεκπύρωσις,[1012] or the “Conflagration of the World.” Of the figure and\r\ncharacter of this performance antiquity, I believe, has left us no\r\naccount, though it probably represented, by a train of allegorical\r\npersonages and movements, the principal events which, according to the\r\nStoics, are to precede the delivering up of the Universe to fire.[1013]\r\nScaliger,[1014] who does not attempt to explain this strange exhibition,\r\nobserves, however, pertinently, that it was a dance in which Nero might\r\nhave figured, his burning of Rome deserving in some sort to be regarded\r\nas a rehearsal of this piece.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1010:\r\n\r\n  It may possibly have been in this dance that Eumelos or Arctinos, an\r\n  old Corinthian poet, introduced Zeus himself sporting the toe:—\r\n\r\n  Μέσσοισιν δ᾽ ὠρχεῖτο πατὴρ ἀνδοῶν τε θεῶν τε.

The line was headed by\r\na young man who executed his part in the firm and vigorous steps proper\r\nto his age, and which he would afterwards be expected to preserve in the\r\nfield of battle. A maiden immediately followed, but, instead of\r\nimitating his masculine manner, confined herself to the modest graceful\r\npaces and gestures of her sex, and this alternation and interweaving, as\r\nit were, of force and beauty, suggesting the idea of a necklace composed\r\nof many coloured gems, gave rise to the appellation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1015:\r\n\r\n  Luc. de Saltat. § 12.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe dance of the Crane,[1016] among the Athenians, in some respects\r\nresembled the above. It was, according to tradition, first invented by\r\nTheseus, who landing at Delos on his return from Crete, offered\r\nsacrifice to Apollo and dedicated the statue of Aphrodite which he had\r\nreceived from Ariadne, after which he joined the young men and women\r\nwhom he had delivered, in performing a joyous dance[1017] about the\r\naltar of Horns erected by Apollo, from the spoils of his sister’s bow.\r\nThe Choreutæ, engaged in executing the Geranos, or Crane, formed\r\nthemselves into one long line with a leader in van and rear, and then,\r\nguided by the design on the floor of the orchestra, described by their\r\nmovements the various mazes and involutions of the Cretan labyrinth,\r\nuntil, having traversed all its intricate passages, they emerged at\r\nonce, like their great countryman and his companions, into light and\r\nsafety. Other dances there were, which, however curious they may have\r\nbeen, cannot now be described from the scanty materials left us: such\r\nwere the dance of Heralds, or Messengers, the dance of the Lily,[1018]\r\nthe Chitonea, the Pinakides, the dance of the Graces,[1019] and that of\r\nthe Hours, in which the performers floated about with a circle of light\r\ndrapery held over the head by both hands.[1020]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1016:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 101.

When\r\nin the tragedy of Æschylus they were required to personate the Furies,\r\ntheir exterior was the most frightful that can well be imagined,—their\r\nlong but scanty robes consisting, as has been conjectured, of black\r\nlamb-skins, slit up below and exposing their tawny withered limbs to\r\nsight, while their blood-stained eyes, livid tongue hanging out, and\r\nhair like a mass of knotted serpents, easily accredited the belief of\r\ntheir being infernal existences. Thus habited, with fingers terminating\r\nin black claws,[1023] and grasping a burning torch, they burst upon the\r\nview of the spectators, like so many hideous phantoms conjured up by an\r\nimagination diseased with terror.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1021:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Gods, heroes, kings, chiefs, soothsayers, heralds, rustics,\r\nthe hetairæ, and their mothers; gay youths, flatterers, libertines,\r\nprocurers, cooks, satyrs, slaves, &c., had each and all their\r\nappropriate dresses and ornaments, modified, no doubt, from time to time\r\nby the change in public taste, and the fancy of the poets. The\r\ndivinities had almost to be wholly framed by the Dionysiac artificers.\r\nConceived to be of superhuman stature, it was necessary that the actors\r\nwho represented them should, in the first place, be lifted up on\r\nCothurni,[1026] or half-boots, the soles of which were many inches\r\nhigh,[1027] their limbs and bodies were enlarged by padding, their arms\r\nlengthened by gloves, while their countenances, which might be ignoble\r\nor even ugly, were concealed by masks of exquisite ideal beauty, rising\r\nabove the stately forehead in a mass of curls, which at once\r\ncorresponded with the nobleness of their features and augmented their\r\ncolossal height: add to all this robes of purple, or scarlet, or azure,\r\nor saffron, or cloth of gold, floating about the person in graceful\r\nfolds, and training along the floor, and we have some faint idea of the\r\ncelestial personages who with gemmed sceptres and glittering crowns made\r\ntheir appearance on the Grecian stage.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1024:\r\n\r\n  On the actors’ wardrobe, see Poll. iv. 113, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1025:\r\n\r\n  Müller, Dissert. on the Eumenides, p. 100.

Ejusmodi uxorum dimidio\r\n  tantùm in lectis frui maritos, alter dimidio cum soccis deposito,” p.\r\n  53.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe queens and heroes,[1028] who were constantly beheld grouped in\r\nconverse, or in action, with these sublime dwellers of Olympos, were\r\nclad in a costume scarcely less majestic; the former, for example, in\r\ntimes of prosperity, issued forth from their palaces in white garments,\r\nwith loose sleeves reaching to the elbow, and closed on the upper part\r\nof the arm by a succession of jewelled agraffes,[1029] their tresses\r\nconfined in front by a golden sphendone, or fillet, crusted with gems,\r\nwhile their robes terminated below in long sweeping trains of\r\npurple.[1030] But when their houses were visited by misfortune, the\r\nmilk-white pelisse was exchanged for one quince-coloured or blue, while\r\nthe purple train was converted into black. The costume of the\r\nkings,[1031] likewise varied by circumstances, consisted usually of an\r\nample robe of purple, or scarlet, or dark green, descending to the feet,\r\na rich cloak of cloth of gold, or of some delicate colour, adorned with\r\ngold embroidery, and a lofty mitre on the head.[1032] When any of these\r\ncharacters, as Tydeus or Meleager, was engaged in hunting or war, he\r\nwore the scarlet or purple mantle called Ephaptis,[1033] which in action\r\nwas wrapped about the left arm. Athenæus, in describing the horsemen of\r\nAntiochos, observes, that these Ephaptides[1034] were embroidered with\r\ngold and adorned with the figures of animals. Bacchanals and\r\nsoothsayers, like Teiresias, generally appeared upon the stage in an\r\nextraordinary garment, denominated Agrenon,[1035] formed of a reticular\r\nfabric of wool of various colours. Dionysos himself,[1036] in whose\r\nhonour the theatre with all its shows was created, descended from\r\nOlympos in a saffron-coloured robe compressed below the bosom by a broad\r\nflowered belt, and bearing a thyrsus in his hand.[1037] This girdle, in\r\nthe case of other gods, or heroes, was sometimes replaced by one of\r\ngold.[1038] Persons overtaken by calamity, especially exiles, wore\r\ngarments dirty-white, or sad-coloured, or black, or quince-coloured, or\r\nbluish. The costume of Philoctetes, Telephos, Œneus, Phœnix,\r\nBellerophontes, was ragged. The Seileni appeared in a shaggy Chiton, and\r\nthe other personages of the Satyric drama in the skins of fawns, or\r\ngoats, or sheep, or pards, and, sometimes, in the Theraion or Dionysiac\r\ngarment, and a flowered cloak and a scarlet Himation. Old men were\r\ndistinguished by the Exomis,[1039] a white Chiton of mean appearance,\r\nhaving no seam or arm-hole on the left side—young men by the\r\nCampulè,[1040] a scarlet or deep purple Himation,—the parasites by\r\nbearing the Stlengis and flask (as country people by the Lagobalon) and\r\nby black or sad-coloured robes, except in the play of the Sicyonians,\r\nwhere a person of this class, being about to be married, sported a white\r\ngarment,—the cook by an Himation double and unfulled,—priestesses by\r\nwhite robes,—comic old women by such as were quince-coloured or dusky,\r\nlike a cloudy morning sky in autumn,—the mothers of the hetairæ wore a\r\npurple fillet about the head,—the dresses of young women were white and\r\ndelicate,—of heiresses the same with fringes. Pornoboski wore garments\r\nof various colours, with flowered cloaks, and carried a straight wand,\r\ncalled ἀρéσκος.[1041] There were, likewise, female characters which wore\r\nthe Parapechu and the Symmetria, a chiton reaching to the feet, with a\r\nborder of marine purple.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1028:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 119.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1029:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

The primary difficulty\r\nconnected with them is, to determine whether they were so constructed as\r\nto resemble a speaking-trumpet,[1043] which, by narrowing the stream,\r\nand compressing, as it were, the particles of the voice, cast it forth\r\ncondensed and corroborated upon the theatre,[1044] which it was thus\r\nenabled to penetrate and fill, even to its utmost extremities. My own\r\nopinion, after bestowing much attention upon the subject, is, that the\r\nmask was in reality so constructed as to communicate additional force\r\nand intensity to the voice; but whether by roofing or encircling the\r\nartificial mouth by metallic plates, or thin laminæ of the stone called\r\nChalcophonos,[1045] it is now scarcely possible to determine. Be this,\r\nhowever, as it may, there existed in some theatres other contrivances\r\nfor conveying and augmenting the volume of the actor’s voice; these were\r\nthe Echeia,[1046] vases generally of metal, finely toned, and arranged\r\naccording to the musical scale, in a succession of domed cells,[1047]\r\nrunning in diverging lines up the hollow face of the theatre. They\r\nrested with one edge upon a smooth and polished pavement, the mouth\r\noutward, and the external edge reposing on the summit of a small, blunt\r\nobelisk,[1048] while a low opening in each cell enabled the resonances,\r\nor echoes, thus created, to issue forth, and fill the air with\r\nsound,[1049] which, however the fact may be accounted for, produced no\r\nisolated reverberations, no confusion.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1042:\r\n\r\n  When actors displeased the audience they were sometimes compelled to\r\n  take off their masks and face those who hissed them, which was\r\n  regarded as a serious punishment.

Plin. ii. 51.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe materials wherewith the masks were constructed varied, no doubt,\r\nconsiderably in different ages;[1050] but that they were ever\r\nmanufactured of bronze or copper is scarcely credible, if we reflect\r\nupon the weight of so voluminous an apparatus, covering the entire head\r\nand neck, composed of either of those metals. Such metallic specimens as\r\nhave come down to us are to be regarded simply as model-masks, or as\r\nworks of art, designed by the statuary as ornaments. The intention, at\r\nfirst, of this disguise being to give additional boldness and\r\nself-confidence to the actor, by concealing from his neighbours the\r\nshamefacedness which a raw performer would sometimes naturally feel\r\nwhile strutting about in imperial robes, and pouring forth the\r\n_sesquipedalia verba_ of Pelias and Telephos, they were contented to\r\ncover the face with a piece of linen, having openings for the eyes and a\r\nbreathing-place.[1051] To this appears to have succeeded a mask\r\nmanufactured from the flexible bark of certain trees,[1052] shaped, of\r\ncourse, and coloured to resemble the human countenance. The next step\r\nwas to employ wood, some kinds of which, while possessing the advantage\r\nof extreme lightness, might be wrought with all the delicacy and\r\nfineness of a statue, while, better than any other material, it would\r\nreceive that smooth and polished enamel by which were represented the\r\ntexture[1053] and complexion of the skin. Specimens of masks of this\r\nkind have been found among nations in a very rude state; among the\r\ninhabitants, for example, of Nootka Sound, whose dress, we are\r\ntold,[1054] “is accompanied by a mask representing the head of some\r\nanimal: it is made of wood, with the eyes, teeth, &c., and is a work of\r\nconsiderable ingenuity. Of these masks they have a great variety, which\r\nare applicable to certain circumstances and occasions. Those, for\r\nexample, which represent the head of the otter or any other marine\r\nanimals, are used only when they go to hunt them. In their war\r\nexpeditions, but at no other time, they cover the whole of their dress\r\nwith large bear-skins.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1050:\r\n\r\n  Scalig. Poet. i. 14.

Thus disguised they chanted their songs\r\nupon the public roads, sitting in a waggon,[1057] whence the proverb,\r\n“he speaks as from the waggon,” _i. e._ he is shamelessly abusive, which\r\nwas in fact the case with the comic poets.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1055:\r\n\r\n  On the Roman Stage the actors appeared in hats up to the age of Livius\r\n  Andronicus.

Ulp. in. §\r\n  5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe masks were divided into three kinds, the Tragic, the Comic, and the\r\nSatyric. Those belonging to Tragedy were again subdivided into numerous\r\nclasses, representing every marked variety of character, and every stage\r\nof human life from childhood to extreme old age. In the highly varied\r\nrange of countenances thus brought into play, the mask-maker enjoyed\r\nabundant opportunities of exhibiting his skill. The hair, of course, was\r\nreal and adjusted on the mask like a wig,[1058] differently fashioned\r\nand coloured according to the age, habits, and complexion of the wearer.\r\nIn some cases it was gathered together and piled up on the\r\nforehead,[1059] in a triangular figure,[1060] adding many inches to the\r\nactor’s stature; at other times it was combed smoothly downwards, from\r\nthe crown, twisted round a fillet and disposed like a wreath about the\r\nhead as we sometimes find it in the figures of Asclepios and the\r\nphilosopher Archytas. Some characters were represented wholly bald, with\r\na garland of vine-leaves or ivy wreathed about the brow,[1061] others\r\nwere simply bald in front, while a third class exhibited a bushy fell of\r\nhair, something like a lion’s mane. Young ladies displayed a profusion\r\nof pendant curls, kept in order by the fillet or sphendone, or gathered\r\nup in nets, or twisted about the head in braided tresses. In\r\nrepresenting certain characters the eye-sockets were left open, so that\r\nthe actor’s eyes could be seen moving and flashing within;[1062] but on\r\nother occasions, when the part of a squinter was to be acted by a\r\nperformer who did not squint or vice versa, as in the case of Roscius\r\nGallus, the mask-maker must have represented the eyes by glass or some\r\nother transparent substance, through which the actor could see his way.\r\nThis was necessarily the case in the part of the poet Thamyris,[1063]\r\nwho, like our own Chatterton, had eyes of different colours, one blue,\r\nthe other black, which, as Aristotle informs us, was common among the\r\nhorses of Greece.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1058:\r\n\r\n  Scalig.

From the poetry of Athens, rife with\r\nsylvan imagery, we, no less than from its history, discover how deeply\r\nthey loved the sunshine and calm and quiet of their fields. The rustic\r\npopulation confined to the city during the Peleponnesian war almost\r\nperished of nostalgia within sight of their village homes. Half the\r\nmetaphors in their language are of country growth. The bee murmurs, the\r\npartridge whirrs, the lark, the nightingale, the thrush, pour their\r\nmusic through the channels of verse and prose. The odours of ripe fruit,\r\nof new wine “purple and gushing,” the fresh invigorating morning breeze\r\nfrom harvest fields, from clover meadows dotted with kine, the scent of\r\nmilk-pails, of honey, and the honey-comb, still breathe sweetly over the\r\nAttic page, and prove how smitten with home delights the Athenian people\r\nwere,\r\n\r\n             “With plesaunce of the breathing fields yfed.”\r\n\r\nThis their manly and healthful taste, however, constantly, in time of\r\nwar, exposed them to the malice of their enemies. For the valleys and\r\ngrassy uplands of Attica, being thickly covered with villas and\r\nfarmhouses,[1068] the first act of an invading army was to lay all those\r\nbeautiful homesteads in ashes. Thus the Persians, in their two\r\ninvasions, destroyed the whole with fire and sword. But the gentlemen,\r\nimmediately on their return, rebuilt their dwellings[1069] with greater\r\ntaste and magnificence, so that, before the breaking out of the\r\nPeloponnesian war, it is probable that, as a scene of unambitious\r\naffluence, taste, high cultivation, and rustic contentment, nothing was\r\never beheld to compare with Attica. Here and there, throughout the land,\r\nperched on rocks, or shaded by trees, were small rustic chapels\r\ndedicated to the nymphs, or rural gods.[1070] On the mountains, and in\r\nsolitary glens, and wherever springs gushed from the cliffs, caverns\r\nwere scooped out by the hands of the leisurely shepherds,[1071] and\r\nconsecrated by association with mythology. Fountains, also, and\r\nwater-courses, altars, statues,[1072] and sacred groves,[1073] protected\r\nat once by religion and the laws,[1074] imprinted on the landscape\r\nfeatures of poetry and elegance.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1068:\r\n\r\n  Demosth. in Ev. et Mnes. § 15.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1069:\r\n\r\n  Thucyd. ii. 65.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1070:\r\n\r\n  In the neighbourhood of the Isthmus the shepherds of the present day\r\n  often pass the winter months in mountain caverns.—Chandler, ii. p.\r\n  261.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1071:\r\n\r\n  Theocrit. i. 143, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1072:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Phæd. t. i. p. 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnother cause which, in the eyes of the Athenians, imparted sanctity to\r\ntheir lands, was the practice of burying in them their dead. The spot\r\nselected for this sacred purpose seems usually to have been the orchard,\r\nwhere, amid fig-trees and trailing vines,[1075] often near the\r\nboundaries of the estate, might be seen the ancient and venerable\r\nmonuments of the dead. All Attica, therefore, in their eyes, appeared\r\nholy as a sepulchre; and, as every one guarded his own ancestral ashes,\r\nto sell a farm cost a man’s feelings more than in countries where people\r\ninter those they love in public cemeteries; and this circumstance with\r\nmany would operate like a law of entail.[1076]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1075:\r\n\r\n  Eurip.

What we want is to thrust aside the impediments, to\r\ndissipate the obscurity of two thousand years, and lift the latch of a\r\nGreek farmhouse, such as it existed in the days of Pericles.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it was common in Attica to erect country-houses in\r\nthe midst of a grove of silver firs,[1077] which in winter protect from\r\ncold, and in summer attract the breezes that imitate in their branches\r\nthe sound of trickling runnels, or the distant murmur of the sea.\r\nTowards the centre of the grove, with a spacious court in front and a\r\ngarden behind, stood the house,[1078] sometimes with flat, sometimes\r\nwith pointed roof, ornamented with a picturesque porch, and surrounded\r\nwith verandahs or colonnades. Occasionally opulent persons had on the\r\nsouth front of their houses large citron trees,[1079] growing in pots,\r\non either side the door, where they were well watered and carefully\r\ncovered during winter.[1080] In the plainer class of dwellings, numerous\r\nouthouses, as stables, sheds for cattle,[1081] henroosts, pigstyes, &c.,\r\nextended round the court, while the back-front, generally in the East\r\nthe principal, opened upon the garden or orchard.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1077:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

In general such positions were\r\nconsidered most favourable as neighboured the sea, or occupied the\r\nsummits or the slopes of mountains,[1083] more especially if looking\r\ntowards the north.[1084] The vicinity of swamps and marshes, and as much\r\nas possible of rivers, was avoided, together with coombs, or hollow\r\nvalleys, and declivities facing the south or the setting sun. If\r\nnecessitated by the nature of the ground to build near the banks of a\r\nstream, the front of the dwelling was carefully turned away from it,\r\ninasmuch as its waters communicated an additional rigour to the winds in\r\nwinter, and in summer filled the atmosphere with unwholesome vapours.\r\nThe favourite exposure was towards the east whence the most salubrious\r\nbreezes were supposed to blow, while the cheerful beams of the sun, as\r\nsoon as they streamed above the horizon, dissipated the dank fogs and\r\nmurkiness of the air. Notwithstanding the warmth of the climate,\r\nmoreover, they loved such situations as were all day long illuminated by\r\nthe sun, whilst every care was taken to fence out the sirocco, a moist\r\nand pestilential wind, blowing across the Mediterranean from the deserts\r\nof Africa. In Italy, nevertheless, the farmer often selected for the\r\nsite of his mansion the southern roots of mountains, further defended\r\nfrom Alpine blasts by a sweep of lofty woods.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1082:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 3.

Nat. viii.\r\n  21. Schulz. Antiq. Rustic. § vii.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMuch, however, would depend upon the taste of the individual; but in a\r\nplain farmhouse more attention appears to have been paid to substantial\r\ncomfort, and something like rough John-Bullism, than to that cold\r\nfinical elegance which certain persons are fond of associating with\r\nwhatever is classical. An Attic farmer of the true old republican school\r\nwas anything but a fine gentleman. He scorned none of the occupations or\r\nproductions by which he lived. On entering his dwelling you found no\r\nsmall difficulty in steering between bags of corn,[1086] piles of\r\ncheeses, hurdles of dried figs[1087] or raisins, while the racks groaned\r\nwith hams[1088] and bacon flitches. If they resembled their\r\ndescendants,[1089] too, even their bedchambers were invaded by some\r\nspecies of provisions, for there in the present day you often behold\r\nlong strings of melons suspended like festoons from the rafters. In one\r\ncorner of the ground-floor stood a corbel filled with olive-dregs,\r\nrecently pressed, in another a wool-sack or a pile of dressed\r\nskins.[1090] Yonder in the room looking into the garden, with the\r\nhoney-suckle twining about the open lattice, were madam’s loom and\r\nspinning-wheel, and carding apparatus, and work-baskets; and there with\r\nthe lark[1091] might you see her, serene and happy, suckling her young\r\ndemocrat, and rocking the cradle of a second with her foot, thriftily\r\ngiving directions the while to Thratta, Xanthia or “the neat-handed”\r\nPhillis.[1092]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1086:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

Up in the\r\ndusky corner there, behind a huge armchair or settle, you may discern a\r\nvery suspicious looking enclosure, from which, at intervals, issues a\r\nsuppressed grunt; it is the pigsty.[1093] But be not offended; the\r\npractice is classical; and pigs, in my apprehension, are as pleasant\r\ncompany as geese and many other animals. Now, that geese were fed even\r\nabout palaces, we have the testimony of Homer, whose Penelope, the _beau\r\nidéal_ of a good housewife, says—\r\n\r\n             “Full twenty geese have we at home, that feed\r\n             On wheat in water steeped.”[1094]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1093:\r\n\r\n  Ἐπὶ τῆς ἑστίας τρέφουσι χοίρους.—Schol.

The same rule applied to\r\nfowls. The chenoboscion,[1097] or enclosure in which the geese were\r\nkept, was commonly situated near ponds or freshes,[1098] abounding with\r\nrich grass and aquatic plants. Geese, it was observed, are not nice in\r\nthe article of food, but devour eagerly nearly all kinds of plants,\r\nthough the chick-pea, and the couch-grass, the laurel and the\r\nlaurel-rose,[1099] were by the ancients supposed to be hurtful to them.\r\nOf their eggs some were hatched by hens, but such as were designed to be\r\nsitten on by the goose herself, (who, during the period of\r\nincubation[1100] was fed on barley steeped in water,) were marked by\r\nwriting or otherwise, to distinguish them from the eggs of their\r\nneighbours, which it was thought she would not be at the pains to hatch.\r\nFor the first ten days after they had broken the shell the young\r\ngoslings were kept within-doors, where they were fed on wheat steeped in\r\nwater, _polenta_ a preparation of barley-meal dried at the fire, and\r\nchopped cresses. This period over, they were driven out to feed and\r\nafterwards to water; they who tended them taking great care that they\r\nshould not be stung by nettles, or pricked by thorns, or swallow the\r\nhair[1101] of pigs or kids, which they imagined to be fatal to them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1096:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xiv. 22.

This ingenious writer, anxious to remove\r\n  from geese the reputation of folly, relates that, when traversing\r\n  Mount Taurus, conscious of their disposition to cackling, they carry\r\n  stones in their bills, and thus frequently escape the eagles which\r\n  inhabit that lofty ridge of mountains. This the poet Phile undertakes\r\n  to confirm in verse:—\r\n\r\n                  Λίθον δὲ τῷ στόματι μὴ κλάγξῃ στέγων\r\n                  Ὅνπερ καλοῦσι Ταῦρον, ἀμείβει πάγον\r\n                  Τοὺς ἀετοὺς γὰρ φασὶ τοὺς χηνοσκόπους,\r\n                  Ἐκεῖσε δεινῶς ἐλλοχᾷν πρὸ τοῦ ψύχους.\r\n\r\n  Iamb.

Cavendum est etiam, ne pulli eorum setas glutiant.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen full-grown geese were intended to be fattened, the custom was, to\r\nconfine them in dark and extremely warm cells.[1102] Their food was\r\nscientifically varied and regulated, proceeding from less to more\r\nnutritious, until they were judged fit for the table. At first their\r\ndiet consisted of a preparation composed of two parts _polenta_, and\r\nfour parts bran boiled in water. Of this they were permitted to eat as\r\nmuch as they pleased three times a day, and once again at midnight,\r\nwhile water was furnished them in abundance. When they had continued on\r\nthis regimen for some time, they were indulged with a more luxurious\r\ntable,—nothing less than the most exquisite dried figs, which, being\r\nchopped small, and dissolved in water, were served up as a sort of jelly\r\nfor twenty days, after which the pampered animal itself was ready for\r\nthe spit.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1102:\r\n\r\n  The Quintilian Brothers, ap. Geop. xiv. 22. For the fate of these\r\n  illustrious authors, Maximus and Condianus, see Gibbon, i. 142. “Sint\r\n  calido et tenebroso loco: quæres ad creandas adipes multum conferunt.”\r\n  Colum. viii. 14.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOccasionally that delicate and humane device, for the practice of which\r\nGermany has, in modern times, obtained so enviable a celebrity, of\r\nenlarging preternaturally the dimensions of the liver, was resorted to\r\nby the ancients,[1103] whose mode of proceeding was as follows: during\r\nfive-and-twenty days, being cooped up as before in a place of high\r\ntemperature, the geese were fed with wheat and barley steeped in water,\r\nthe former of which fattened, while the latter rendered their flesh\r\ndelicately white. For the next five days certain cakes or balls,\r\ndenominated collyria,[1104] the composition of which is not exactly\r\nknown, were given them at the rate of seven per day, after which the\r\nnumber was gradually augmented to fifteen, which constituted their whole\r\nallowance for other twenty days. To this succeeded the most\r\nextraordinary dish of all, consisting of bolusses of leavened dough,\r\nsteeped in a warm decoction of mallows, by which they were puffed up for\r\nfour days. Their drink, meanwhile, was still more delicious than their\r\nfood, being nothing less than hydromel,[1105] or water mingled with\r\nhoney. During the last six days dried figs, chopped fine, were added to\r\ntheir leaven, and the process being thus brought to a conclusion, the\r\ngourmands for whom they were intended, feasted on the tenderest geese\r\nand the largest livers in the world. It should be added, however, that\r\nbefore being cooked the liver was thrown into a basin of warm water,\r\nwhich the _artistes_ several times changed. Geese, adds the ingenious\r\ngastronomer to whom we are indebted for these details, are, both for\r\nflesh and liver, much inferior to ganders. The Greeks did not, however,\r\nlike the Romans and the moderns, select young geese for this species of\r\nculinary apotheosis, but birds of a mature age and of the largest size,\r\nfrom two to four years old, which only proves the superior strength and\r\nkeenness of their teeth.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1103:\r\n\r\n  Eupolis, ap.

In the centre were certain green\r\nislets,[1106] planted with couch-grass, which the ancients considered as\r\nbeneficial to ducks as it was hurtful to geese. Their usual food, which\r\nwas cast in the water encircling the islets, consisted of wheat, millet,\r\nbarley, sometimes mixed with grape-stones and grape-skins. Occasionally\r\nthey were indulged with locusts, prawns, shrimps,[1107] and whatever\r\nelse aquatic birds habitually feed on. Persons desirous of possessing\r\ntame ducks were accustomed to beat about the lakes and marshes[1108] for\r\nthe nest of the wild bird. Giving the eggs to a hen to sit on, they\r\nobtained a brood of ducklings perfectly domesticated.[1109] Wild ducks\r\nwere sometimes caught by pouring red wine, or the lees of wine, into the\r\nsprings whither they came to drink.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1106:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xiv. 23.

For this purpose cocks and hens were\r\nimported[1110] from the shores of the Adriatic, from Italy, Sicily,\r\nNumidia, and Egypt, while those of Attica were occasionally exported to\r\nother countries. There appears to have been a prejudice against keeping\r\nmore than fifty fowls[1111] about one farmyard, some traces of which may\r\nalso be discovered in the practice of the Arabs.[1112] The fowl-house\r\nfurnished with roosts,[1113] as with us, was so contrived and situated\r\nas to receive from the kitchen a tolerable supply of smoke, which was\r\nsupposed to be agreeable to these Median strangers. The food of\r\nfowls[1114] being much the same all the world over, it is unnecessary to\r\nobserve more than that the green leaves of the Cytisus were supposed to\r\nrender them prolific. To preserve them from vermin, the juice of rue, by\r\nway I suppose of charm, was sprinkled over their feathers.[1115] The\r\nproportion of male birds was one to six. Hens were usually put to sit\r\nabout the vernal equinox, during the first quarter of the moon, in nests\r\ncarefully constructed of boards, and strewed with fresh clean straw,\r\ninto which, as a sort of talisman against thunder, they threw an iron\r\nnail, heads of garlic, and sprigs of laurel.[1116] During the period of\r\nincubation, the eggs which had previously been kept in bran were turned\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1110:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vii. 23.

They were fattened with millet, panic, and pure water.[1123]\r\nOther still smaller birds were reared, and fattened in like manner.\r\nEvery farmhouse had, moreover, its columbary and dove-cotes,[1124]\r\nsometimes so large as to contain five thousand birds. They usually\r\nconsisted of spacious buildings,[1125] roofed over and furnished with\r\nwindows closed by lattice work, made so close that neither a lizard nor\r\na mouse could creep through them. In the floor were channels and basins\r\nof water, in which these delicate birds[1126] might wash and plume\r\nthemselves, and adjoining was a chamber into which such as were required\r\nfor sale, or the table, were enticed. Even jackdaws were kept about\r\nfarmyards, and like common fowls had perches set up for them.[1127]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1117:\r\n\r\n  Schol. Aristoph. Acharn. 63. Petit. Leg. Att. p. 277.

They were reckoned,\r\nlikewise, among the most precious victims offered in sacrifice to the\r\ngods. Thus we find the Trojans plunging live horses into the whirlpool\r\nof the Scamander[1134] to deprecate the anger of that divinity. The\r\nRomans, likewise, in later times, sacrificed horses to the ocean;[1135]\r\nand, in many parts of Asia, it appears to have been customary in nearly\r\nall ages, to offer up, as anciently in Laconia,[1136] this magnificent\r\nanimal on the altars of the sun.[1137] Thus, among the Armenians, whose\r\nbreed, though smaller than that of the Persians, was far more spirited,\r\nthis practice prevailed as it still does in Northern India, and\r\nXenophon,[1138] a religious man, observes in the Anabasis, that he gave\r\nhis steed, worn down with the fatigues of the march, to be fed and\r\noffered up by the Komarch, with whom he had been for some days a guest.\r\nFrom Homer’s account of Pandarus we may infer, that the possessors of\r\nfine horses often submitted to great personal inconvenience rather than\r\nhazard the well-being of their favourites. For this wealthy\r\nprince,[1139] who possessed eleven carriages and twenty-two steeds, came\r\non foot to the assistance of Priam, lest they should not find a\r\nplentiful supply of provender at Troy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1133:\r\n\r\n  See also Iliad, ε. 358.

But one of the most remarkable races was that produced\r\nin Nisæon,[1142] a district of Media, which seems to have been white, or\r\nof a bright cream colour,[1143] and of extraordinary size and swiftness.\r\nOn one of these Masistios[1144] was mounted during the expedition into\r\nGreece. Apollo, in an oracle is said to have spoken of the beauty of\r\nmares, alluding, perhaps, to those of Elis, which were remarkable for\r\ntheir lightness and elegance of form; and Aristotle celebrates a\r\nparticular mare of Pharsatis, called Dicæa, which was famous for\r\nbringing colts resembling their sires.[1145] Among the Homeric chiefs,\r\nAchilles and Eumelos boasted the noblest coursers, as we learn from a\r\npicturesque and striking passage in the Catalogue:[1146] “And now, O\r\nMuse, declare, which of the leaders and their horses were most\r\nillustrious. Excepting those of Achilles, the finest steeds before Troy\r\nwere those of Eumelos from Pheræ, swift as birds, alike in mane, in age,\r\nand so equal in size, that a rule would stand level on their backs. They\r\nwere both bred by Apollo in Pieria, both mares, and they bore with them\r\nthe dread of battle. Noblest of all, however, were the coursers of\r\nAchilles. But he, in his lunar-prowed, sea-passing ships remains\r\nincensed against Atreides, the shepherd of his people; his myrmidons\r\namuse themselves on the sea-shore with pitching the quoit, launching the\r\njavelin, and drawing the bow; their horses, standing beside the\r\nchariots, feed upon lotus, trefoil and marsh parsley; and the chariots\r\nthemselves, well covered with hangings, are drawn up in the tents of the\r\nchiefs, while the soldiers, sighing for the leading of their impetuous\r\ngeneral, stroll carelessly through the camp without joining in the war.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1140:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

They judged of the breeding of a horse by\r\nthe shortness of its coat and the dusky prominence of its veins. As a\r\nfine large mane greatly augments the magnificent appearance of this\r\nanimal, they were careful after washing to comb and oil it[1152] while\r\nthey gathered up the forelock in a band of gilded leather.[1153] The\r\nfloors of their stables were commonly pitched with round pebbles bound\r\ntight together by curbs of iron.[1154]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1151:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xvi. 2.

Notwithstanding the\r\n  admiration of the Greeks for horses we do not find that they made any\r\n  attempt to naturalize among them those Shetlands of the ancient world\r\n  which, according to a very grave naturalist, were no larger than rams.\r\n  These diminutive steeds were found in India:—Παρά γε τοῖς ψύλλοις\r\n  καλουμένοις τῶν Ἰνδῶν, εἱσὶ γὰρ καὶ Λιβύων ἕτεροι, ἵπποι γίνονται τῶν\r\n  κριῶν οὐ μείζους.

They began with\r\nthe year-and-a-half colts,[1157] on which they put a halter when\r\nfeeding, while a bridle was hung up close to the manger, that they might\r\nbe accustomed to the touch of it, and not take fright at the jingling of\r\nthe bit.[1158] The next step was to lead them into the midst of noisy\r\nand tumultuous crowds in order to discover whether or not they were bold\r\nenough to be employed in war.[1159] The operation was not completely\r\nfinished till they were three years old. When, on the course or\r\nelsewhere, horses had been well sweated,[1160] they were led into a\r\nplace set apart for the purpose, and, in order to dry themselves, made\r\nto roll in the sand. It was customary for owners to mark their horses\r\nwith the Koppa,[1161] or other letter of the alphabet, whence they were\r\nsometimes called Koppatias, Samphoras, &c.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1155:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Rep. t. vi. p. 158.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1156:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph. de Re Equest. ii. 2.

He, in fact, observes in his Memoirs, that in the city of\r\nAssos he saw a milk-white hog two cubits and a half in length, and of\r\nequal height; and adds, that King Eumenes had given four thousand\r\ndrachmæ, or nearly two hundred pounds sterling, for a boar of this\r\nenormous size, to improve the breed of pigs in his country.[1166] So\r\nthat we perceive those great generals, whom posterity usually\r\ncontemplates only in the cabinet or in the battle-field, were, at the\r\nsame time, in their domestic policy, the rivals of the Earls Spencer and\r\nLeicester. Superstition, among the Cretans, prevented the improvement of\r\nbacon; for as a sow was said to have suckled the infant Jupiter, and\r\ndefended his helpless infancy, they, in gratitude,[1167] abstained from\r\nhog’s flesh.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1166:\r\n\r\n  Athen. ix. 17.

The oxen[1168] were used in ploughing, treading out the\r\ncorn, drawing manure to the fields, and bringing home the produce of the\r\nharvest. To prevent their being overcome by fatigue while engaged in\r\ntheir labours, the husbandmen of Greece had recourse to certain\r\nexpedients, one of which was, to smear their hoofs with a composition of\r\noil and terebinth, or wax, or warm pitch:[1169] while, to protect them\r\nfrom flies, their coats were anointed with their own saliva, or with a\r\ndecoction of bruised laurel berries and oil.[1170] Their milch cows, in\r\nthe selection of which much judgment was displayed,[1171] were commonly\r\nfed on cytisus and clover; and, still further to increase their milk,\r\nbunches of the herb dittany were sometimes tied about their flanks. The\r\nusual milking-times[1172] were, in the morning immediately after the\r\nbreaking-up of the dawn, and in the evening about the close of twilight;\r\nthough, occasionally, both cows, sheep, and goats were milked several\r\ntimes during the day. In weaning calves they made use of a species of\r\nmuzzle,[1173] as the Arabs do in the case of young camels. Their pails,\r\nlike our own, were of wood,[1174] but somewhat differently shaped, being\r\nnarrow above, and spreading towards the bottom. When conveyed into the\r\ndairy the milk was poured into pans,[1175] on the form of which I have\r\nhitherto found no information.[1176] That they skimmed their milk is\r\nevident (whatever they may have done with the cream), from the mention\r\nof that thin pellicle which is found on it only when skimmed, whether\r\nscalded or not. “Here, drink this!” said Glycera to Menander, when he\r\nhad returned one day in exceeding ill-humour from the theatre. “I don’t\r\nlike the wrinkled skin,” replied the poet to the lady, whose beauty, it\r\nmust be remembered, was at this time on the wane. “Blow it off,” replied\r\nshe, immediately comprehending his meaning, “and take what is\r\nbeneath.”[1177] Milk, in those warm latitudes, grows sour more rapidly\r\nthan with us; but the ancients observed that it would keep three days\r\nwhen it had been scalded, and stirred until cold with a reed or\r\nferula.[1178]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1168:\r\n\r\n  Scheffer, De Re Vehic. p. 80; et vid.

For cheese,\r\nhowever, they seem to have entertained a partiality, though it is\r\nprobable that the best they could manufacture would have lost very\r\nconsiderably in comparison with good Stilton or Cheshire, not to mention\r\nParmasan. It was a favourite food, however, among soldiers in Attica,\r\nwho during war used to supply themselves both with cheese and\r\nmeal.[1181] Their cheese-lope or rennet in most cases resembled our own,\r\nconsisting of the liquid substance found in the ruen of new-born\r\nanimals, as calves, kids, or hares, which was considered superior to\r\nlamb’s rennet.[1182] Occasionally they employed for the same purpose\r\nburnt salt or vinegar, fowl’s crop or pepper, the flowers of bastard\r\nsaffron, or the threads which grow on the head of the artichoke. For\r\nthese again, was sometimes substituted the juice of the fig-tree;[1183]\r\nor a branch freshly cut[1184] was used in stirring the milk while\r\nwarming on the fire. This cheese would seem, for the most part, to have\r\nbeen eaten while fresh and soft,[1185] like that of Neufchatel, though\r\nthey were acquainted with various means of preserving it for a\r\nconsiderable space of time. Acidulated curds were kept soft by being\r\nwrapped in the leaves of the terebinth tree, or plunged in oil, or\r\nsprinkled with salt. When desirous of preserving their cheese for any\r\nlength of time, they washed it in pure water, and, after drying it in\r\nthe sun, laid it upon earthen jars with thyme and summer savory. Some\r\nother kinds were kept in a sort of pickle, composed of sweet vinegar or\r\noxymel or sea-water, which was poured into the jars until it entirely\r\npenetrated and covered the whole mass. When they wished to communicate a\r\npeculiar whiteness to the cheese, they laid it up in brine. Dry cheese\r\nwas rendered more solid and sharp-tasted by being placed within reach of\r\nthe smoke. If from age it were hard or bitter, it was thrown into a\r\npreparation of barley-meal, then soaked in water, and what rose to the\r\ntop was skimmed off.[1186]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1179:\r\n\r\n  See Beckman.

This diet was then exchanged for\r\nbarley, of which for nearly a week they were allowed four cotylæ a-day,\r\nthe quantity being then gradually augmented for six other days. As of\r\nnecessity the hinds were stirring early, the cattle began even in winter\r\nto be fed at cock-crowing; a second quantity of food was given them\r\nabout dawn, when they were watered, and their remaining allowance\r\ntowards evening. In summer their first meal commenced at day-break, the\r\nsecond at mid-day, and the third about sunset. They were at this time of\r\nthe year suffered to drink at noon and night of water rendered somewhat\r\ntepid; in winter it was considerably warmer.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1188:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xvii. 12.

Herodotus, who mentions\r\na similar fact, calls food of this description χόρτος, “fodder,”[1189]\r\nthough hay or dried straw was, doubtless, its original meaning. The\r\nprovender of cattle in the district about Ænia appears to have been so\r\nwholesome, that the herds which fed upon it were never afflicted by the\r\nmange.[1190]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1189:\r\n\r\n  Herod. v. 16.

The natural\r\nhistory, moreover, of the bee was studied with singlar enthusiam by the\r\nGreeks in general. Aristomachos of Soli, devoted to it fifty-eight\r\nyears, and Philiscos, the Thasian, who passed his life among bees in a\r\ndesert, obtained on that account the name of the Wild Man. Both wrote on\r\nthe subject.[1195]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1194:\r\n\r\n  The pasturage of Hymettos, however, was, by Pausanias, regarded as\r\n  second to that of the Alazones on the river Halys, where the bees were\r\n  tame, and worked in common in the fields. i. 32. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1195:\r\n\r\n  Plin. Hist. Nat. xi. 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis branch of rural economy was carried to very great perfection in\r\nAttica. The vocabulary[1196] connected with it was extensive, as every\r\nseparate operation had its technical term, by the study of which,\r\nchiefly, an insight into their practice is obtained. Thus, from certain\r\nexpressions employed by Aristotle[1197] and Pollux, it seems clear that\r\nbee-managers, whom we may occasionally call melitturgi, constituted a\r\nseparate division among the industrious classes; and these, instructed\r\nby constant experience, probably anticipated most of the improvements\r\nimagined in modern times. For example, instead of destroying the\r\nvaluable and industrious little insects for the purpose of obtaining\r\npossession of their spoils, they in some cases compelled them by smoke\r\nto retire temporarily from the hive, whence their treasures were to be\r\ntaken; and in the mining districts about Laureion they understood the\r\nart, concerning which, however, no particulars are known, of procuring\r\nthe virgin honey pure and unsmoked.[1198]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1196:\r\n\r\n  Poll. i. 254.

Book vi. p. 412, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe grounds of a melitturgos or bee-keeper were chosen and laid out with\r\npeculiar care.[1199] In a sheltered spot, generally on the thymy slope\r\nof a hill, the hives were arranged in the midst of flowers and\r\nodoriferous shrubs. And if the necessary kinds had not by nature been\r\nscattered there, they were planted by the gardener. Experience soon\r\ntaught them what blossoms and flowers yielded the best honey,[1200] and\r\nwere most agreeable to the bees. These, in Attica, were supposed to be\r\nthe wild pear-tree, the bean, clover, a pale-coloured vetch, the syria,\r\nmyrtle, wild poppy, wild thyme, and the almond-tree.[1201] To which may\r\nbe added the rose, balm gentle, the galingale or odoriferous rush, basil\r\nroyal, and above all the cytisus,[1202] which begins to flower about the\r\nvernal equinox, and continues in bloom to the end of September.[1203] Of\r\nall the plants, however, affected by the bee, none is so grateful to it\r\nas the thyme, which so extensively abounds in Attica and Messenia[1204]\r\nas to perfume the whole atmosphere. In Sicily too, all the slopes and\r\ncrests of its beautiful hills, from Palermo to Syracuse, are invested\r\nwith a mantle of thyme,[1205] and other odoriferous shrubs, which,\r\naccording to Varro, gives the superior flavour to the Sicilian honey.\r\nBox-wood abounded on mount Cytoros, in Galatia, and in the island of\r\nCorsica, on which account the honey of the latter country was\r\nbitter.[1206]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1199:\r\n\r\n  On the management of bees in Circassia and other countries on the\r\n  Black Sea, see Pallas, Travels in Southern Russia, ii. p. 204.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1200:\r\n\r\n  On the coast of the Black Sea bees sucked honey from the grape.

Stratagem. i. 2. 1. Offensive smells are often reckoned among\r\n  the aversions of bees, but I fear without good reason. At least they\r\n  have sometimes been found to select strange places wherein to deposit\r\n  their treasures of sweets. In the book of Judges, chap. xiv. ver. 8,\r\n  seq., it is related that, when Samson, on his way to Timnath, turned\r\n  aside to view the carcass of a young lion which he had a short time\r\n  previously slain, “behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the\r\n  carcass of the lion, and he took thereof in his hands and went on\r\n  eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them and they\r\n  did eat, but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the\r\n  carcass of the lion.” Upon this passage the following may serve as a\r\n  note:—“Among this pretty collection of natural curiosities, (in the\r\n  cemetery of Algesiras,) one in particular attracted our attention;\r\n  this was the contents of a small uncovered coffin in which lay a\r\n  child, the cavity of the chest exposed and tenanted by an industrious\r\n  colony of bees. The comb was rapidly progressing, and I suppose,\r\n  according to the adage of the poet, they were adding sweets to the\r\n  sweet, if not perfume to the violet.” Napier, Excursions on the Shores\r\n  of the Mediterranean, v. i. 127.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1208:\r\n\r\n  Georg. iv. 50, with the commentaries of Servius and Philargyrius; and\r\n  Varro, De Re Rust. iii. 16.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCare was taken to conduct near the hives small runnels of the purest\r\nwater, not exceeding two or three inches in depth with shells or pebbles\r\nrising dry above the surface, whereon the bees might alight to\r\ndrink.[1209] When of necessity the apiary was situated on the margin of\r\nlakes or larger streams other contrivances were had recourse to for the\r\nconvenience of the airy labourers.\r\n\r\n             Then o’er the running stream or standing lake\r\n             A passage for thy weary people make,\r\n             With osier floats the standing water strow,\r\n             Of massy stones make bridges if it flow,\r\n             That basking in the sun thy bees may lie\r\n             And resting there their flaggy pinions dry,\r\n             When late returning home the laden host\r\n             By raging winds is wrecked upon the coast.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1209:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Geop. xv. 2, 3, 4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTheir hives were of various kinds and shapes.

The wicker-hives were\r\noccasionally plastered both inside and outside with cow-dung to fill up\r\nthe cavities and smooth the surface.[1212] A more beautiful species of\r\nhive was sometimes made with the lapis specularis,[1213] which, being\r\nalmost as transparent as glass, enabled the curious owner to contemplate\r\nthe movements and works of the bees.[1214] When finished, they were\r\nplaced on projecting slabs, so as not to touch or be easily shaken.\r\nThere were generally three rows of hives rising above each other like\r\nEgyptian tombs on the face of the wall, and there was a prejudice\r\nagainst adding a fourth.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1210:\r\n\r\n  Vir.

Mem. i. 75. The practice, moreover, of stealing\r\n  hives was not unknown to the ancients. Plat. De Legg. t. viii. p. 104.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere were, in ancient times, two entrances, one on either hand, and on\r\nthe top a lid, which the Melitturgos could remove when he desired to\r\ntake the honey, or inspect the condition of the bees. The best of these\r\nlids were made of bark, the worst of earthenware, which were cold in\r\nwinter, and in summer exceedingly hot.[1219] It was considered necessary\r\nduring spring and the succeeding season for the bee-keeper to inspect\r\nthe hives thrice a month, to fumigate them slightly, and remove all\r\nfilth and vermin. He was careful, likewise, to destroy the usurpers if\r\nthere were more than one queen,[1220] since, in Varro’s[1221] opinion,\r\nthey gave rise to sedition; but Aristotle thinks there ought to be\r\nseveral, lest one should die, and the hive along with it. Of the queen\r\nbees there are three kinds, the black, the ruddy, and the variegated;\r\nthough Menecrates, who is good authority, speaks only of the black and\r\nvariegated.[1222] Aristotle, however, describes the reddish queen bee as\r\nthe best. Even among the working insects there are two kinds, the\r\nsmaller, in form round, and variegated in colour, the larger, which is\r\nthe tame bee, less active and beautiful. The former, or wild bee,[1223]\r\nfrequents the mountains, forests, and other solitary places, labours\r\nindefatigably, and collects honey in great quantities; the latter, which\r\nfeeds among gardens, and in man’s neighbourhood, fills its hive more\r\nslowly.[1224] With respect to the drones, or males, which the working\r\nbees generally expel at a certain time of the year, the Attic melitturgi\r\ngot rid of them in a very ingenious manner. It was observed, that these\r\ngentlemen though no way inclined to work, would yet occasionally, on\r\nvery fine days, go abroad for exercise, rushing forth in squadrons,\r\nmounting aloft into the air, and there wheeling, and sporting, and\r\nmanœuvring in the sun.[1225] Taking advantage of their absence, they\r\nspread a fine net over the hive-entrance, the meshes of which, large\r\nenough to admit the bee, would exclude the drone. On returning,\r\ntherefore, they found themselves, according to the old saying, “on the\r\nsmooth side of the door,” and were compelled to seek fresh\r\nlodgings.[1226]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1219:\r\n\r\n  Colum. ix. 6.

Œcon. xvii. 14, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn late springs, or when there is a drought or blight, the bees breed\r\nvery little, but make a great deal of honey, whereas in wet seasons they\r\nkeep more at home, and attend to breeding. Swarms in Greece[1227]\r\nappeared about the ripening of the olive. Aristotle is of opinion, that\r\nhoney is not manufactured by the bee, but falls perfectly formed from\r\nthe atmosphere, more especially at the heliacal rising or setting of\r\ncertain stars, and when the rainbow appears. He observes, too, that no\r\nhoney is found before the rising of the Pleiades,[1228] which happens\r\nabout the thirteenth of May.[1229] This opinion is in exact conformity\r\nwith the fact, that at certain seasons of the year what is called the\r\nhoney dew descends, covering thick the leaves of the oak, and several\r\nother trees, which at such times literally drop with honey. On these\r\noccasions the bees find little to do beyond the labour of conveying it\r\nto their cells, and, accordingly, have been known to fill the hive in\r\none or two days. It has been observed, moreover, that autumn flowers,\r\nwhich yield very little fragrance, yield, also, little or no honey. In\r\nthe kingdom of Pontos there was a race of white bees which made honey\r\ntwice a month; and at Themiscyra there were those which built their\r\ncombs both in hives and in the earth, producing very little wax, but a\r\ngreat deal of honey.[1230]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1227:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Sch. Aristoph. Vesp. 425. In the island of Cuba, where the tame\r\n  bee was originally introduced by the English, it has been found to\r\n  swarm and multiply with incredible rapidity, each hive sometimes\r\n  sending forth two swarms per month, so that the mountains are\r\n  absolutely filled with them. This rapid increase seems to have taken\r\n  place chiefly in the neighbourhood of the sugar plantations, which\r\n  they were long since supposed to deteriorate by extracting too much\r\n  honey from the cane.

Among the numerous species of wild bees\r\n  found in America there is one which pre-eminently deserves to be\r\n  introduced into Europe and brought under the dominion of man. This bee\r\n  does not, like the ordinary kind, deposit its honey in combs but in\r\n  separate waxen cells about the size and shape of a pigeon’s egg. As\r\n  the honey of this bee is of an excellent quality, many persons in\r\n  South America have been at the pains to tame its maker, whose labours\r\n  have proved extremely profitable.—Schneider, Observ. sur Ulloa, ii.\r\n  200.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen the time of year arrived for robbing the bee, some hives were found\r\nto produce five, others ten, others fifteen quarts of honey, still\r\nleaving sufficient for winter consumption.[1231] And in determining what\r\nquantity would suffice great judgment was required; for if too much\r\nremained the labourers grew indolent, if too little they lost their\r\nspirits. However, in this latter case the bee-keepers, having\r\nascertained that they were in need of food, introduced a number of sweet\r\nfigs, and other similar fruit into the hive, as now we do moist sugar in\r\na split cane. Elsewhere the practice was to boil a number of rich figs\r\nin water[1232] till they were reduced to a jelly, which was then formed\r\ninto cakes and set near the hive. Together with this, some bee-keepers\r\nplaced honey-water, wherein they threw locks of purple wool, on which\r\nthe bees might stand to drink.[1233] Certain melitturgi, desirous of\r\ndistinguishing their own bees[1234] when spread over the meadows,\r\nsprinkled them with fine flour. Mention is made of a person who obtained\r\nfive thousand pounds’ weight of honey annually; and Varro[1235] speaks\r\nof two soldiers who, with a small country house, and an acre of ground\r\nleft them by their father, realised an independent fortune.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1231:\r\n\r\n  Arist.

This last, which was sometimes denominated\r\nIndian honey, is the sugar of modern times. There appear, likewise, to\r\nhave been other kinds of sugar manufactured from different substances,\r\nas Tamarisk and Wheat.[1237] The honey-dew, on the production of which\r\nthe ancients[1238] held many extraordinary opinions, was supposed to be\r\nsuperior to the nectar of the bee.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1236:\r\n\r\n  Preserved by Photius.

In some cases they gathered the leaves\r\nof the tree, chiefly the linden and the oak, on which the dew was most\r\nabundantly[1239] found, and pressed them together like those masses of\r\nSyrian figs, which were called _palathè_. Others allowed it to drop from\r\nthe leaves and harden into globules, which, when desirous of using, they\r\nbroke, and, having poured water thereon in wooden bowls called\r\n_tabaitas_, drank the mixture. In the districts of Mount Lebanon[1240]\r\nthe honey-dew fell plentifully several times during the year, and was\r\ncollected by spreading skins under the trees, and shaking into them the\r\nliquid honey from the leaves; they then filled therewith numerous\r\nvessels, in which it was preserved for use. On these occasions, the\r\npeasants used to exclaim, “Zeus has been raining honey!”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1239:\r\n\r\n  Theoph. Hist. Plant. iii. 7. 6. Cf. Hes. Opp. et Dies, 232. seq.

This, likewise, was the conviction of the\r\nancient Greeks,[1241] in whose literature we everywhere discover\r\nvestiges of a passion for that voluptuous solitude which men taste in\r\nartificial and secluded plantations, amid flower-beds and arbours and\r\nhanging vines and fountains and smooth shady walks. No full description,\r\nhowever, of an Hellenic garden has survived; even the poets have\r\ncontented themselves with affording us glimpses of their “studious walks\r\nand shades.” We must, therefore, endeavour, by the aid of scattered\r\nhints, chance expressions, fragments, and a careful study of the natural\r\nand invariable productions of the country, to work out for ourselves a\r\npicture of what the gardens of Peisistratos, or Cimon, or Pericles, or\r\nEpicurus, whom Pliny[1242] denominates the _magister hortorum_, or any\r\nother Grecian gentleman, must in the best ages have been.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1241:\r\n\r\n  But see Dr. Nolan on the Grecian Rose, Trans.

Cf. Xenoph.\r\n  Œconom. iv. 13, where he celebrates the fondness of the Persian kings\r\n  for gardens.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThat portion of the ground[1243] which was devoted to the culture of\r\nsweet-smelling shrubs and flowers, usually approached and projected\r\ninwards between the back wings of the house, so that from the windows\r\nthe eye might alight upon the rich and variegated tints of the\r\nparterres[1244] intermingled with verdure, while the evening and morning\r\nbreeze wafted clouds of fragrance into the apartments.[1245] The lawns,\r\nshrubberies, bosquets, thickets, arcades, and avenues, were, in most\r\ncases, laid out in a picturesque though artificial manner, the principal\r\nobject appearing to have been to combine use with magnificence, and to\r\nenjoy all the blended hues and odours which the plants and trees\r\nacclimated in Hellas could afford. Protection, in summer, from the sun’s\r\nrays, is, in those southern latitudes, an almost necessary ingredient of\r\npleasure, and, therefore, numerous trees, as the cedar,[1246] the\r\ncypress, the black and white poplar,[1247] the ash, the linden, the elm,\r\nand the platane, rose here and there in the grounds, in some places\r\nsingly, elsewhere in clumps, uniting their branches above, and affording\r\na cool and dense shade. Beneath these umbrageous arches the air was\r\nfurther refrigerated by splashing fountains,[1248] whose waters, through\r\nnumerous fair channels, straight or winding, as the use demanded of them\r\nrequired,[1249] spread themselves over the whole garden, refreshing the\r\neye and keeping up a perpetual verdure. Copses of myrtles, of roses, of\r\nagnus-castus,[1250] and other odoriferous shrubs intermingled,\r\nclustering round a pomegranate-tree, were usually placed on elevated\r\nspots,[1251] that, being thus exposed to the winds, they might the more\r\nfreely diffuse their sweetness. The spaces between trees were sometimes\r\nplanted with roses,[1252] and lilies, and violets, and golden\r\ncrocuses;[1253] and sometimes presented a breadth of smooth, close,\r\ngreen sward, sprinkled with wild-flowers, as the violet and the blue\r\nveronica,[1254] the pink, and the pale primrose, the golden motherwort,\r\nthe cowslip, the daisy, the pimpernel, and the periwinkle. In many\r\ngardens the custom was, to plant each kind of tree in separate groups,\r\nand each species of flower-bed also had, as now in Holland,[1255] a\r\ndistinct space assigned to it; so that there were beds of white\r\nviolets,[1256] of irises, of the golden cynosure,[1257] of hyacinths, of\r\nranunculuses, of the blue campanula, or Canterbury bells, of white\r\ngilliflowers, carnations, and the branchy asphodel.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1243:\r\n\r\n  Here sometimes were grown both vegetables, as lettuces, radishes,\r\n  parsley, &c., and flowering shrubs, as the wild or rose-laurel, which\r\n  was supposed to be a deadly poison to horses and asses.

Phæd. t. i. p. 8, seq.

Thus the Spartans, during the Promachian\r\nfestival,[1259] shaded their foreheads with plaited tufts of\r\nreeds—priests and priestesses, soothsayers,[1260] prophets, and\r\nenchanters, appeared in their several capacities before the gods in\r\ntemples or sacred groves with symbolical crowns encircling their heads,\r\nas the priests of Hera, at Samos, with laurel,[1261] and those of\r\nAphrodite with myrtle,[1262] while the statues of the divinities\r\nthemselves were often crowned with circlets of these “earthly stars.” In\r\nthe festival of Europa, at Corinth, a crown of myrtle, thirty feet in\r\ncircumference, was borne in procession through the city.[1263] The\r\nactors, dancers, and spectators of the theatre usually appeared crowned\r\nwith flowers,[1264] as did every guest at an entertainment, while lovers\r\nsuspended a profusion of garlands on the doors of their mistresses, as\r\ndid the devout on the temples and altars of the gods.[1265]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1258:\r\n\r\n  Πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ ἀφ’ ὧν ζῶσιν οἱ ἄνθρωποι, ταῦτα ἡ γῆ φέρει\r\n  ἐργαζομένοις· καὶ ἀφ’ ὧν τοίνυν ἡδυπαθοῦσι προσεπιφέρει.—Ἔπειτα δὲ ὅσα\r\n  κοσμοῦσι βωμοὺς και ἀγάλματα, καὶ οἷς αὐτοὶ κοσμοῦνται, καὶ ταῦτα μετὰ\r\n  ἡδίστων ὀσμῶν καὶ θεαμάτων παρέχει. κ. τ. λ. Xenoph. Œconom. v. 2,\r\n  seq.\r\n\r\n  Pliny has a curious passage on the use of crowns among the Romans,\r\n  which Holland has thus translated: “Now when these garlands of flowers\r\n  were taken up and received commonly in all places for a certain time,\r\n  there came soon after into request those chaplets which are named\r\n  Egyptian; and after them, winter coronets, to wit, when the earth\r\n  affordeth no flowers to make them, and these consisted of horn\r\n  shavings dyed into sundry colours. And so in process of time, by\r\n  little and little crept into Rome, also the name of corolla, or as one\r\n  would say, petty garlands; for that these winter chaplets at first\r\n  were so pretty and small: and not long after them, the costly coronets\r\n  and others, corollaries, namely, when they are made of thin leaves and\r\n  plates and latten, either gilded or silvered over, or else set out\r\n  with golden and silvered spangles, and so presented.” xxi. 2. Pollux\r\n  affords a list of the principal flowers used in crowns by the Greeks:\r\n  τὰ δὲ ἐν τοῖς στεφάνοις ἄνθη, ῥόδα, ἴα, κρίνα, σισύμθρια, ἀνεμῶναι,\r\n  ἕρπυλος, κρόκος, ὑάκινθος, ἑλίχρυσος, ἡμεροκαλὲς, ἑλένειον, θρυαλὶς,\r\n  ἀνθρίσκος, νάρκισσος, μελίλωτον, ἀνθεμὶς, παρθενὶς, καὶ τἄλλα ὅσα τοῖς\r\n  ὀφθαλμοῖς τέρψιν, ἠῥισὶν ἡδεῖαν ὄσφρησιν ἔχει.

But this theory, imagined for the purpose of destroying the\r\nclaims of the Anacreontic fragments to be considered genuine,[1272] is\r\nentirely overthrown by the testimony of several ancient writers, more\r\nparticularly Herodotus,[1273] who speaks of the rose of sixty leaves, as\r\nfound in the gardens of Midas in Thrace, at the foot of the snowy\r\nBermios. Elswhere, too, he compares the flower of the red Niliac\r\nlotus[1274] to the rose; and Stesichoros,[1275] an older poet than\r\nAnacreon, distinctly mentions chaplets composed of this flower.\r\n\r\n                Many a yellow quince was there\r\n                Piled upon the regal chair,\r\n                Many a verdant myrtle-bough,\r\n                Many a rose-crown featly wreathed,\r\n                With twisted violets that grow\r\n                Where the breath of spring has breathed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1271:\r\n\r\n  By Dr. Nolan.

The secret,\r\nmoreover, was early discovered of hastening or retarding their maturity,\r\nso as to obtain an abundant supply through every month in the\r\nyear.[1279] Occasionally, too, numbers of rosebuds were laid among green\r\nbarleystalks, plucked up by the roots, in unglazed amphoræ, to be\r\nbrought forth and made to blow when wanted. Others deposited them\r\nbetween layers of the same material on the ground, or dipped them in the\r\nliquid dregs of olives. Another mode of preserving the rose was\r\nexceedingly curious,—cutting off the top of a large standing reed, and\r\nsplitting it down a little way, they inserted a number of rosebuds in\r\nthe hollow, and then bound it softly round and atop with papyrus in\r\norder to prevent their fragrance from exhaling.[1280] How many varieties\r\nof this flower[1281] were possessed by the ancients it is now, perhaps,\r\nimpossible to determine; but they were acquainted with the common, the\r\nwhite, and the moss rose, the last, in Aristotle’s[1282] opinion, the\r\nsweetest, together with the rose of a hundred leaves,[1283] celebrated\r\nby the Persian poets. Even the wild rose was not wholly inodorous in\r\nGreece.[1284] Roses were artificially blanched by being exposed while\r\nunfolding to powerful and repeated fumigations with sulphur.[1285] The\r\nroses which grew on a dry soil were supposed to be the sweetest, while\r\ntheir fragrance was augmented by planting garlic near the root.[1286] To\r\ncause them to bloom in January, or in early spring (for even in the most\r\nsouthern parts of Greece the rose season only commences in April)[1287]\r\nvarious means were resorted to; sometimes, the bushes were watered twice\r\na-day during the whole summer; on other occasions, a shallow trench was\r\ndug at a distance of about eighteen inches round the bush, into which\r\nwarm water was poured morning and evening;[1288] while a third, and,\r\nperhaps, the surest, method was to plant them in pots, or baskets,\r\nwhich, during the winter months, were placed in sheltered sunny spots by\r\nday,[1289] and carried into the house at night; afterwards, when the\r\nseason was sufficiently advanced, these portable gardens were buried in\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1279:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xi. 18. A species of perpetual rose is said to have been\r\n  recently discovered in France, where “A Parisian florist, we are told,\r\n  has succeeded in producing a new hybrid rose from the Bourbon rose and\r\n  Gloire de Rosomène, the flowers of which he had fertilised with the\r\n  pollen of some Damask and hybrid China roses. The plant is extremely\r\n  beautiful, the colour bright crimson shaded with Maroon purple, and is\r\n  further enriched with a powerful fragrance.” TIMES, March 24th, 1841.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1280:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xi. 18. 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1281:\r\n\r\n  Plinius varia genera commemorat, Milesia ardentissimo colore,\r\n  Alabandica albicantibus foliis, Spermonia vilissima, Damascenæ albæ\r\n  distillandis aquis usurpantur.

This\r\nflower naturally begins to bloom[1291] just as the roses are fading;\r\nbut, to produce a succession of lilies at different seasons, some were\r\nset near the surface, which grew up and blossomed immediately, while\r\nothers were buried at different depths, according to the times at which\r\nthey were required to flower.\r\n\r\nAlong with these, about the dank borders of streams or fountains, grew\r\nthe favourite flower of the Athenian people, purple, double, white, and\r\ngold,[1292]\r\n\r\n                                     “The violet dim,\r\n               But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes,\r\n               Or Cytherea’s breath;”[1293]\r\n\r\nthe pansy,[1294] “freaked with jet;” the purple cyperus, the iris, the\r\nwater-mint,[1295] and hyacinth,[1296] and the narcissus,[1297] and the\r\nwillow-herb, and the blue speedwell, and the marsh-marigold, or, brave\r\nbassinet, and the jacinth, and early daffodil,\r\n\r\n             “That come before the swallow dares, and take\r\n             The winds of March with beauty.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1290:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xi. 20.

The myrtle,[1311] whose deep blue berries were\r\nesteemed a delicacy,[1312] in some places rose into a tree, while\r\nelsewhere it was planted thick, and bent and fashioned into\r\nbowers,[1313] which, when sprinkled with its snowy blossoms, combined,\r\nperhaps, with those of the jasmine, the eglantine, and the yellow tufts\r\nof the broad-leaved philyrea,[1314] constituted some of the most\r\nbeautiful objects in a Greek paradise. Thickets of the tamarisk,[1315]\r\nthe strawberry-tree,[1316] the juniper, the box, the bay, the styrax,\r\nthe andrachne, and the white-flowered laurel, in whose dark leaves the\r\nmorning dew collects and glistens in the sun like so many tiny mirrors\r\nof burnished silver, varied the surface of the lawn, connecting the\r\nbowers, and the copses, and the flower beds, and the grassy slopes with\r\nthose loftier piles of verdure, consisting of the pine tree, the smilax,\r\nthe cedar, the carob, the maple,[1317] the ash, the elm tree, the\r\nplatane,[1318] and the evergreen oak which here and there towered in the\r\ngrounds. In many places the vine shot up among the ranges of elms or\r\nplatanes, and stretched its long twisted arm from trunk to trunk, like\r\nso many festoons of intermingled leaves and tendrils, and massive\r\nclusters of golden or purple grapes.[1319] Alternating, perhaps, with\r\nthe lovely favourite of Dionysos, the blue and yellow clematis[1320]\r\nsuspended their living garlands around the stems, or along the boughs of\r\nthe trees, in union or contrast with the dodder, or the honeysuckle, or\r\nthe delicate and slender briony. And, if perchance a silver fir, with\r\nits bright yellow flowers,[1321] formed part of the group, large pendant\r\nclusters of mistletoe, the food sometimes of the labouring ox,[1322]\r\nmight frequently be seen swinging thick among its branches. In some\r\ngrounds was probably cultivated the quercus suber,[1323] or cork tree,\r\nwith bark four or five inches thick, triennially stripped off,[1324]\r\nafter which it grows again with renewed vigour. Occasionally, where\r\nstreams and rivulets[1325] found their way through the grounds, the\r\nblack and white poplar, the willow, and the lentiscus, with a variety of\r\ntufted reeds, crowded about the margin, here and there shading and\r\nconcealing the waters.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1310:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

A proof of this practice prevailing in\r\nAttica, has with much ingenuity[1335] been brought forward from the\r\n“Frogs,” where Bacchos, addressing the poet Æschylus in the shades,\r\nobserves “It will be all right provided your anger does not transport\r\nyou beyond the olives.” It may likewise be remarked that in\r\nolive-grounds,[1336] the trees, excepting the sacred ones called\r\n_moriæ_, were always planted in straight lines, from twenty-five to\r\nthirty feet[1337] apart, because, in order to ripen the fruit,[1338] it\r\nis necessary that the wind should be able freely to play upon it from\r\nall sides. And further because they delight in a warm dry air like that\r\nof Libya, Cilicia,[1339] and Attica, the best olive-grounds were\r\ngenerally supposed to be those which occupied the rapid slopes of hills\r\nwhere the soil is naturally stony and light.

And such an orchard decked in its summer pride with\r\nfoliage of emerald and fruit, ruddy, purple, and gold, the notes of the\r\nthrush, the nightingale,[1356] the tettix, with the “amorous thrill of\r\nthe green-finch,”[1357] floating through its boughs, and the perfume of\r\nthe agnus-castus, the myrtle, the rose, and the violet, wafting richly\r\non all sides, was a very paradise.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1356:\r\n\r\n  Ἔτι δὲ τὸ ἔμπνουν τῆς αὔρας λιγυρὸν ὑπηχεῖ τῷ μουσικῷ τῶν τεττίγων\r\n  χορῷ δι᾽ ἥν καὶ τὸ πνίγος τῆς μεσημβρίας ἠπιῶτερον ἐγεγόνει ἡδὺ καὶ\r\n  ἀηδόνει, περὶ πετόμεναι τὰ νάματα, μελωδοῦσιν. ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἡδὺ\r\n  φώνῶν κατηκούομεν ὀρνίθων, ὥσπερ ἐμμελῶς ὁμιλούντων ανθρώποις.\r\n  Aristænet.

The contrary\r\nis the case in modern Europe. In Burgundy and Switzerland, where\r\npathways traverse vineyards, it is not uncommon to see the grapes\r\nsmeared with something resembling white lime which children are assured\r\nis a deadly poison. This, while in the country, I regarded as a mere\r\nstratagem, intended to protect the vineyards from depredation, though\r\nthere seems after all to be too much reason to believe the nefarious\r\npractice to exist in several localities. At least two children were\r\nrecently killed at Foix by eating poisoned grapes on the way-side.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1358:\r\n\r\n  Plat.

From the East, no doubt, they obtained, along with their\r\nnoblest fruit-trees, the art of cultivating them, and, perhaps, that\r\nsacred tradition of the Garden of Eden, preserved in the Scriptures,\r\nformed the basis of many a Hellenic legend.[1362] The Syrians acquired\r\nmuch celebrity among the ancients for their knowledge of gardening, in\r\nwhich, according to modern travellers, they still excel. Of the manner\r\nof cultivating fruit-trees in the earlier ages very little is known. No\r\ndoubt they soon discovered that some will thrive better in certain soils\r\nand situations than in others, and profited by the discovery; but the\r\nart of properly training and grafting trees is comparatively\r\nmodern.[1363]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1359:\r\n\r\n  Eudoc.

Hist.\r\n  Plant. ii. 1. 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNo mention of it occurs in the Pentateuch, though Moses there gives\r\ndirections how to manage an orchard. For the first three years the\r\nblossoms were not to be suffered to ripen into fruit, and even in the\r\nfourth all that came was sacred to the Lord. From the fifth year,\r\nonward, they might do with it what they pleased. Of these regulations\r\nthe intention was to prevent the early exhaustion of the trees. Homer,\r\nalso, is silent on the practice of grafting, nor does any mention of it\r\noccur in the extant works of Hesiod, though Manilius[1364] refers to his\r\npoems in proof of the antiquity of the practice. By degrees, however, it\r\ngot into use;[1365] and, in the age of Aristotle,[1366] was already\r\ncommon, as at present almost everywhere, save in Greece,[1367] since no\r\nfruit was esteemed excellent unless the tree had been grafted. Some few\r\nof the rules they observed in this process may be briefly noticed.[1368]\r\nTrees with a thick rind were grafted in the ordinary way, and sometimes\r\nby inserting the graft between the bark and the wood, which was called\r\ninfoliation.[1369] Inoculation, also, or introducing the bud of one tree\r\ninto the rind of another, was common among Greek gardeners.[1370] They\r\nwere extremely particular in their choice of stocks.[1371] Thus the fig\r\nwas grafted only on the platane[1372] and the mulberry; the mulberry on\r\nthe chestnut,[1373] the beech, the apple, the terebinth, the wild pear,\r\nthe elm, and the white poplar, (whence white mulberries;) the pear on\r\nthe pomegranate, the quince, the mulberry, (whence red pears,) the\r\nalmond, and the terebinth; apples[1374] on all sorts of wild pears and\r\nquinces, (whence the finest apples called by the Athenians\r\nMelimela,)[1375] on damascenes, also, and _vice versâ_, and on the\r\nplatane, (whence red apples.)[1376] Another method of communicating a\r\nblush to this fruit was to plant rose-bushes round the root of the\r\ntree.[1377] The walnut was grafted on the strawberry-tree only;[1378]\r\nthe pomegranate on the myrtle[1379] and the willow; the laurel on the\r\ncherry[1380] and the ash; the white peach on the damascene and the\r\nalmond; the damascene on the wild pear, the quince, and the apple;\r\nchestnuts on the walnut, the beech, and the oak;[1381] the cherry on the\r\nterebinth, and the peach; the quince on the oxyacanthus; the myrtle on\r\nthe willow; and the apricot on the damascene, and the Thasian\r\nalmond-tree. The vine, also, was grafted on a cherry and a myrtle-stock,\r\nwhich produced, in the first case, grapes in spring,[1382] in the\r\nsecond, a mixed fruit, between the myrtle-berry and the grape.[1383]\r\nWhen the gardener desired to obtain black citrons, he inserted a\r\ncitron-graft into an apple-stock, and, if red, into a mulberry-stock.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1364:\r\n\r\n  Astronomicon, ii. p. 30. l. 4.

This tree\r\n  attains a prodigious size in Peloponnesos. Chandler, Travels, ii. 308.\r\n  Our traveller was prevented from measuring the stem by the fear of\r\n  certain Albanian soldiers who lay asleep under it; but Theophrastus\r\n  gives us the dimensions of a large platane, at Antandros, whose trunk,\r\n  he says, could scarcely be embraced by four men, while its height\r\n  before the springing forth of the boughs was fifteen feet. Having\r\n  described the dimensions of the tree, he relates a very extraordinary\r\n  fact in natural history, namely, that this platane, having been blown\r\n  down by the winds and lightened of its branches by the axe, rose again\r\n  spontaneously during the night, put forth fresh boughs, and flourished\r\n  as before. The same thing is related of a white poplar in the museum\r\n  at Stagira, and of a large willow at Philippi. In this last city a\r\n  soothsayer counselled the inhabitants to offer sacrifice, and set a\r\n  guard about the tree, as a thing of auspicious omen. Theoph. Hist.\r\n  Plant. iv. 16. 2, seq. Cf.

It is certain, however, that they possessed the means of\r\nripening fruits throughout the winter, either by hothouses or other\r\ncontrivances equally efficacious.[1387] During the festival celebrated\r\nin honour of the lover of Aphrodite, the seeds of flowers were sown in\r\nthose silver pots, or baskets, called the gardens of Adonis,[1388] and\r\nwith artificial heat and constant irrigation compelled to bloom in eight\r\ndays. Among the modern Hindus corn is still forced to spring up in a few\r\ndays, by a similar process, during the festival of Gouri.[1389] To\r\nproduce rathe figs,[1390] a manure, composed of dove’s dung and pepper\r\nand oil, was laid about the roots of the tree. Another method was that\r\nwhich is still employed under the name of caprification, alluded to by\r\nSophocles.[1391] For this purpose care was taken to rear, close at hand,\r\nseveral wild fig-trees, from which might be obtained the flies made use\r\nof in this process,[1392] performed by cutting off bunches of wild figs\r\nand suspending them amid the branches of the cultivated species,[1393]\r\nwhen a fly issuing from the former pricked the slowly ripening fruit and\r\naccelerated its maturity.[1394] In growing the various kinds of fig they\r\nwere careful to plant the Chelidonian, the Erinean, or wild fig, the\r\nLeukerinean, and the Phibaleian[1395] on plains. The autumn-royals would\r\ngrow anywhere. Each sort has its peculiar excellence. The following were\r\nthe best: the colouroi, or truncated, the forminion, the diforoi, the\r\nMegaric, and the Laconian, which would bear abundantly if\r\nwell-watered.[1396] Rhodes was famous for its excellent figs, which were\r\neven thought worthy to be compared with those of Attica.[1397] Athenæus,\r\nhowever, pretends that the best figs in the world were found at Rome.\r\nThere were figs with a ruddy bloom in the island of Paros, the same in\r\nkind as the Lydian fig.[1398] The Leukerinean produced the white\r\nfig.[1399]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1386:\r\n\r\n  On the artificial ripening of dates, Theoph. ii. 8. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1387:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 19.

Vitruv.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe fancy of Hellenic gardeners amused itself with effecting numerous\r\nfantastic changes in the appearance and nature of fruit. Thus citrons,\r\nlemons, &c., were made, by the application of a clay mould, to assume\r\nthe form of the human face, of birds and other animals.[1400]\r\nOccasionally, too, they were introduced, when small, into the neck of a\r\nbottle provided with breathing holes, the figure of which they assumed\r\nas they projected their growth into all its dimensions. We are assured,\r\nmoreover, that, by a very simple process, they could produce peaches,\r\nalmonds,[1401] &c., covered, as though by magic, with written\r\ncharacters. The mode of operation was this,—steeping the stone of the\r\nfruit in water for several days, they then carefully divided it, and\r\ntaking out the kernel inscribed upon it with a brazen pen whatever words\r\nor letters they thought proper. This done, they again closed the stone\r\nover the kernel, bound it round with papyrus, and planted it; and the\r\npeaches or almonds which afterwards grew on that tree bore every one of\r\nthem, _mirabile dictu!_ the legend inscribed upon the kernel. By similar\r\narts[1402] they created stoneless peaches, walnuts without husks, figs\r\nwhite one side, and black the other, and converted bitter almonds into\r\nsweet.[1403]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1400:\r\n\r\n  Geop. x. 9.

A\r\nrude practice, too, common enough in our own rural districts, appears to\r\nhave been in much favour among them,—bending some long pendant bough to\r\nthe ground, they covered a part of it with heavy clods, allowing,\r\nhowever, the extremity to appear above the earth. When it had taken root\r\nit was severed from the tree and transplanted to some proper situation.\r\nAt other times, the points of boughs were drawn down and fixed in the\r\nground, which even thus took root, and sent the juices backwards, after\r\nwhich the bough was cut off and a new stock produced. Trees generated by\r\nthis method, as well as those planted during the waning moon,[1406] were\r\nsupposed to spread and grow branchy, while those set during the waxing\r\nmoon attained, though weaker, to a much greater height. It ought,\r\nperhaps, to be further added, that all seeds and plants were put into\r\nthe ground while the moon was below the horizon.[1407] Those trees which\r\nit was customary to renew by seed were the pistachio, the filbert, the\r\nalmond, the chestnut, the white peach, the damascene, the pine-tree, and\r\nthe edible pine, the palm, the cypress, the laurel, the ash, the maple,\r\nand the fig. The apple,[1408] the cherry, the rhamnus jujuba, the common\r\nnut, the dwarf laurel, the myrtle, and the medlar, were propagated by\r\nsuckers; while the quicker and surer mode of raising trees from boughs\r\nwas frequently adopted in the case of the almond, the pear, the\r\nmulberry, the citron,[1409] the apple, the olive, the quince,[1410] the\r\nblack and white poplar, the ivy, the jujube-tree, the myrtle, the\r\nchestnut, the vine, the willow, the box, and the cytisus.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1404:\r\n\r\n  Geop. x. 3.

The custom seems to have been to lay out the\r\nwhole in beds and borders for the cultivation of vegetables, and to\r\nplant trees, at intervals, along the edges and at the corners. These\r\nbeds, moreover, were often, as with us, edged with parsley and rue;\r\nwhence the proverb,—“You have not proceeded beyond the rue,” for “You\r\nknow nothing of the matter.”[1411]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1411:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

In the most sunny spots were ranges of\r\nboxes or baskets for forcing cucumbers.[1415] Near the brooks, where\r\nsuch existed, were patches of watermelons,[1416] the finest in the\r\nworld; and here and there, clasping round the trunks of trees,[1417]\r\nand, suspending its huge leaves and spheres from among the branches, you\r\nmight behold the gourd,[1418] as I have often seen it in the palm-groves\r\nof Nubia.

Thus, in the case of the cucumber,\r\ntheir principal object appears to have been to produce it without seed,\r\nor of some extraordinary shape.[1424] In the first case they diligently\r\nwatched the appearance of the plant above ground, and then covering it\r\nover with fresh earth, and repeating the same operation three times, the\r\ncucumbers it bore were found to be seedless. The same effect was\r\nproduced by steeping the seeds in sesamum-oil for three days before they\r\nwere sown. They were made to grow to a great length by having vessels of\r\nwater[1425] placed daily within a few inches of their points, which,\r\nexciting by attraction a sort of nisus in the fruit, drew them forward\r\nas far as the gardener thought necessary.[1426] They were made,\r\nlikewise, to assume all sorts of forms by the use of light, fictile\r\nmoulds,[1427] as in the case of the citron. Another method was, to take\r\na large reed,[1428] split it, and clear out the pith; then introducing\r\nthe young cucumber into the hollow, the sections of the reed were bound\r\ntogether, and the fruit projected itself through the tube until it\r\nacquired an enormous length. It is observed by Theophrastus, that if you\r\nsteep the seeds of cucumbers in milk, or an infusion of honey, it will\r\nimprove their flavour.[1429] They were, moreover, believed to expand in\r\nsize at the full of the moon, like the sea-hedgehog.[1430] A fragrant\r\nsmell was supposed to be communicated to melons[1431] by constantly\r\nkeeping the seed in dry rose-leaves. To preserve the seed for any length\r\nof time, it was sprinkled with the juice of house-leek.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1424:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xii. 19. 1, sqq.

This plant was probably obtained from Libya,[1436] where it was\r\nsaid to attain, in its wild state, the height of twelve, and sometimes\r\neven of thirty cubits;[1437] and on the slopes of Lebanon, in Syria, it\r\nhas in our own clay been seen from twelve to fifteen feet high.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1435:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xii. 18. 2.

In and about Alexandria,[1439] however, there was said to be some\r\npeculiar quality in the earth which communicated a bitter taste to the\r\ncabbage. To prevent this they imported cabbage-seed from the island of\r\nRhodes, which produced good plants the first year, but experienced in\r\nthe second the acrid influence of the soil.[1440] Kumè was celebrated\r\nfor its fine cabbages, which, when full-grown, were of a yellowish green\r\ncolour, like the new leather sole of a sandal. Broccoli and sea-kale and\r\ncauliflowers would appear to have been commonly cultivated in the\r\ngardens of the ancients. There was, likewise, among them a sort of\r\ncabbage supposed to have some connexion with the gift of prophecy;[1441]\r\nand by this, probably, it was, that certain comic personages used to\r\nswear, as Socrates by the dog, and Zeno by the caper-bush.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1438:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 41.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1439:\r\n\r\n  Athen. ix. 9.

Platonici flores quosdam\r\n  etiam Lunæ dicunt esse familiares: qui sane huic Sideri, sicut illi\r\n  suo canant hymnos, sed mortalibus ignotos auribus.” Exercit. 170, § 2.\r\n  “The cause (of the bowing of the heliotrope) is somewhat obscure; but\r\n  I take it to be no other, but that the part against which the sun\r\n  heateth, waxeth more faint and flaccid in the stalk, and thereby less\r\n  able to support the flower.” Bacon, Sylva Sylvarum § 493.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBesides these the ancients usually cultivated in their grounds two\r\nspecies of cistus, one with pale red flowers now called the long rose,\r\nthe other which about midsummer has on its leaves a sort of fatty dew,\r\nof which laudanum is made;[1461] together with the blue eringo,[1462]\r\nrocket, cresses, (which were planted in ridges,) bastard parsley,\r\npenny-royal, anis,[1463] water-mint, sea-onions, monk’s rhubarb,\r\npurslain, a leaf of which placed under the tongue quenched thirst,\r\ngarden coriander, hellebore, yellow, red, and white, bush origany,[1464]\r\nwith its pink cones, flame-coloured fox-glove, brank-ursine, or bear’s\r\nfoot, admired for its vast pyramid of white flowers, chervil, skirwort,\r\nthe mournful elecampane, giant fennel, dill, mustard and wake-robin,\r\nwhich was sown,\r\n\r\n           Soon as the punic tree, whose numerous grains,\r\n           When thoroughly ripe, a bright red covering hides,\r\n           Itself did with its bloody blossoms clothe.[1465]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1461:\r\n\r\n  Sibth.

The same effect was produced by\r\nwatering the ground thus prepared, though this species was supposed to\r\nbe inferior. In France, the most delicate sort of mushrooms are said to\r\nproceed from the decayed root of the Eryngium.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1477:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xii. 41. 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis vegetable appears to have been a favourite dish among the ancients,\r\ntogether with the truffle,[1478] eaten both cooked and raw;[1479] and\r\nthe morrille.[1480] That particular kind, called geranion, is the modern\r\ncrane’s bill. The Misu, another sort of truffle,[1481] grew chiefly in\r\nthe sandy plains about Cyrene, and, as well as the Iton,[1482] found in\r\nthe lofty downs of Thrace, was said to exhale an agreeable odour\r\nresembling that of animal food. These fanciful luxuries, which were\r\nproduced among the rains and thunders[1483] of autumn, continued to\r\nflourish in the earth during a whole year, but were thought to be in\r\nseason in spring. Truffle-seed was usually imported from Megara, Lycia,\r\nand Getulia; but in Mytelene the inhabitants were spared this expense,\r\ntheir sandy shores being annually sown from the neighbouring coast by\r\nthe winds and showers. It has been remarked, that neither truffles nor\r\nwild onions were found near the Hellespont.[1484]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1478:\r\n\r\n  Sch. Aristoph.

At present[1485] their existence\r\nis said to be detected in Greece, not by the truffle hound, but by the\r\ndivining rod. On the dry sandy downs of the Limousin, Gascogne,\r\nAngoumois, and Perigord, as well as in several parts of Italy,[1486]\r\nthey are collected by the swineherds; for the hogs being extremely fond\r\nof them utter grunts of joy, and begin to turn up the earth as soon as\r\nthey scent their odour, upon which the herdsmen beat the animals away,\r\nand carefully preserve the delicacy for the tables of the rich. At other\r\ntimes they are discovered in the following manner: the herdsmen stooping\r\ndown, and looking horizontally along the surface of the Landes, observe\r\nhere and there, on spots bare of grass and full of fissures, clouds of\r\nvery diminutive flies hatched in the truffle, and still regaling\r\nthemselves with its perfume.

Like most things the\r\norigin of which was unknown, the vine furnished the poets and common\r\npeople with the subjects of numerous fables, some of which were reckoned\r\nof sufficient importance to be treasured up and transmitted to\r\nposterity. Thus, among the Ozolian Locrians, it was said[1490] to have\r\nsprung from a small piece of wood, brought forth in lieu of whelps by a\r\nbitch. Others supposed a spot near Olympia[1491] to have given birth to\r\nthe vine, in proof of which the inhabitants affirmed a miracle was\r\nwrought annually among them during the Dionysiac festival. They took\r\nthree empty brazen vessels, and having closely covered and sealed them\r\nin the presence of witnesses, again opened them after some interval of\r\ntime, not stated, when they were found full of wine. According to other\r\nauthorities, the environs of Plinthinè, in Egypt, had the honour of\r\nbeing the cradle of Dionysos, on which account the ancient Egyptians\r\nwere by some accused of inebriety, though in the age of Herodotus[1492]\r\nthere would appear to have been no vineyards in the whole valley of the\r\nNile. In reality,[1493] the vine appears to be a native of all temperate\r\nclimates, both in the old world and the new, and will even\r\nflourish[1494] and produce fine grapes in various situations within the\r\ntropics, where clusters in different stages of ripeness may be observed\r\nupon its branches at all seasons of the year.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1487:\r\n\r\n  The importance of this branch of cultivation in some countries may be\r\n  perceived from the fact, that in France it is said to afford\r\n  employment to 2,200,000 families, comprising a population of\r\n  6,000,000, or nearly one-fifth of the population of the entire\r\n  kingdom. TIMES, Aug. 3, 1838. The quantity of land devoted to the\r\n  culture of the vine was estimated in 1823, at 4,270,000 acres, the\r\n  produce of which amounted to 920,721,088 gallons, 22,516,220_l._\r\n  15_s._ sterling.

Georg. ii. 348.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBy some the vine was even thought to delight in the rich alluvial soil\r\nof plains, such as is found in Egypt,[1499] where, in later times, the\r\nbanks of the Nile, from Elephantinè to the sea, seem to have presented\r\none vast succession of vineyards.[1500] But superior vines were produced\r\non a few spots only, as at Koptos, and in the neighbourhood of Lake\r\nMareotis, where showers of sand, pouring in from the desert or the\r\nsea-shore, diminished the fatness of the ground. With respect to Koptos,\r\nwe possess, however, no precise information,[1501] but are expressly\r\ntold, that the Mareotic vineyards covered a series of sandy swells,\r\nstretching eastward from the lake towards Rosetta.[1502] On the southern\r\nconfines of Egypt, in the rocky and picturesque island of Elephantinè,\r\nthe vine was said[1503] never to shed its leaves; but as none grow there\r\nat present, the traveller has no opportunity of deciding this question.\r\nIn Greece the vineyards of the plains were generally appropriated to the\r\nproduction of the green grape, the purple being supposed to prefer the\r\nsides of hills, or even of mountains, provided it were not exposed to\r\nthe furious winds upon their summits. Several sorts of white grape,\r\nalso, as the Psillian, Corcyrean, and the Chlorian, delighted in\r\nelevated vineyards,[1504] though it was often judged necessary to\r\nreverse these rules, and compel the hill-nurslings to descend to the\r\nplains, while those of the plains were in their turn exposed to the\r\nclimate of the mountains.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1499:\r\n\r\n  Καλλίστη δὲ γῆ καὶ ἑ ὑπὸ τῶν ῥεόντων ποταμῶν χωσθεῖσα, ὅθεν καὶ τὴν\r\n  Αἴγυπτον ἐπαινοῦμεν.—Florent. ap.

All these vines it will be\r\n  remembered were cut down by order of the Caliph Beamrillah, even in\r\n  the province of the Fayoum. Some vestiges, however, of vineyards were\r\n  here discovered by Pococke. “I observed,” says he, “about this lake\r\n  (Mœris) several roots in the ground, that seemed to me to be the\r\n  remains of vines, for which the country about the lake was formerly\r\n  famous. Where there is little moisture in the air, and it rains so\r\n  seldom, wood may remain sound a great while, though it is not known\r\n  how long these vineyards have been destroyed.” Vol. i. p. 65.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1501:\r\n\r\n  Though with regard to the nature of the wine itself we are told, that\r\n  it was so light as to be given to persons in fevers,—ὁ δὲ κατὰ τὴν\r\n  Θηβαΐδα, καὶ μάλιστα ὁ κατὰ τὴν Κόπτον πόλιν, οὕτως ἐστὶ λεπτὸς, καὶ\r\n  εὐανάδοτος, καὶ ταχέως πεπτικὸς, ὡς τοῖς πυρεταίνουσι διδόμενος μὴ\r\n  βλάπτειν.

Thus in warm\r\ncountries, as in the Pentapolis of Cyrene, the vineyards sloped towards\r\nthe north; in Laconia, they occupied the eastern face of Mount Taygetos,\r\nwhile in Attica and the islands, the hills often appear to have been\r\nencircled with vines. Upon the whole, however, those were most esteemed\r\nwhich looked towards the rising sun and enjoyed, without obstruction,\r\nthe first rays of the morning.[1505] And this also is the case in the\r\nCôte d’Or, where the best wines, as the Chambertin, the Vin de Beaune,\r\nand that of the Clos Vougeot, are grown on eastern declivities. In some\r\nparts of Greece, the vine was strongly affected by the prevalence of\r\ncertain winds, as those of the east and the west in Thessaly, which in\r\nthe forty cold days of winter were attended by frost that killed its\r\nupper extremities, and sometimes the whole trunk. At Chalcis, in Eubœa\r\nlikewise, the Olympias, a western wind, parched and shrivelled, or, as\r\nthe Greeks express it, burnt up the leaves, sometimes completely\r\ndestroying the shrub itself.[1506] In such situations it was accordingly\r\nfound necessary to protect it by a covering[1507] during the prevalence\r\nof cold winds. At Methana, in Argolis, when the south-east in spring\r\nblew up the Saronic gulf,[1508] the inhabitants, to defend them from it,\r\nspread over their vines the invisible teguments of a spell; which was\r\neffected in the following manner: taking a milk-white cock, and cutting\r\nit in halves, two men seized each a part, and then, standing back to\r\nback, started off in opposite directions, made the tour of the vineyard,\r\nand, returning whence they had set out, buried the cock’s remains in the\r\nearth. After this the Libs might blow as it listed, since it possessed\r\nno power to injure any man’s property within the consecrated\r\ncircle.[1509] The prevalence of the north wind during autumn was\r\nconsidered auspicious, as they supposed it to hasten the ripening of the\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1505:\r\n\r\n  Geop. v. 4.1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1506:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

Chandler, Travels, ii. 248.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen the husbandman had resolved on the formation of a new vineyard, he\r\nfirst, of course, encircled the spot with a hedge[1510] which was made\r\nboth thick and strong for the purpose of repelling the flocks and herds,\r\nwhich, as well as goats, foxes, and soldiers, loved to prey upon the\r\nvine.[1511] His next care was to root up the hazel bush and the\r\noleaster, the roots of the former being supposed to be inimical to the\r\nDionysiac tree, while the oily bark of the latter rendered it peculiarly\r\nsusceptible of taking fire, by which means vineyards would often appear\r\nto have been reduced to ashes. So at least says Virgil.[1512]\r\n\r\n      Root up wild olives from thy laboured lands,\r\n      For sparkling fire from hinds’ unwary hands\r\n      Is often scattered o’er their unctuous rinds,\r\n      And often spread abroad by raging winds;\r\n      For first the smouldering flame the trunk receives,\r\n      Ascending thence it crackles in the leaves;\r\n      At length victorious to the top aspires,\r\n      Involving all the wood in smoky fires.\r\n      But most when driven by winds the flaming storm\r\n      Of the long files destroys the beauteous form;\r\n      In ashes then the unhappy vineyard lies,\r\n      Nor will the blasted plants from ruin rise,\r\n      Nor will the withered stock be green again,\r\n      But the wild olive shoots, and shades th’ ungrateful plain.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1510:\r\n\r\n  Virg.

Dryden’s Translation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe next operation[1513] was to trench the ground and throw it into\r\nlofty ridges, which, by the operation of the summer sun, and the rain\r\nand winds and frosts of winter, were rendered mellow and genial.\r\nOccasionally a species of manure, composed[1514] of pounded acorns,\r\nlentils, and other vegetable substances, was dug in for the purpose of\r\ngiving to the soil the warmth and fertility required by the vine.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1513:\r\n\r\n  Geop. iii. 4. Cf. Virg. Georg. ii. 259, seq. et Serv. ad loc.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1514:\r\n\r\n  Geop. v. 24.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe ground having remained in this state during a whole year, its\r\nsurface was levelled, and a series of shallow furrows traced for the\r\nslips by line, rather close, on rich alluvial plains, but diverging more\r\nand more[1515] in proportion to the elevation of the site. Generally the\r\nvine was propagated by slips of moderate length, planted sometimes\r\nupright or à l’aiguille,[1516] as the phrase is in Languedoc, sometimes\r\nobliquely,[1517] which was generally supposed to be the better fashion.\r\nAlong with the slip a handfull of grape-stones was usually cast into the\r\nfurrow,[1518] those of the green grape with the purple vine, and those\r\nof the purple with the green, in order to cause it the sooner to take\r\nroot. With some the practice was always to set two slips together, so\r\nthat if one missed the other might take, and when both grew, the weaker\r\nwas cut off or removed. Several stones,[1519] about the size of the\r\nfist, were placed round the slip above whatever manure was used, the\r\nbelief being, that they would aid in preventing the root from being\r\nscorched by the sun in the heats of summer.[1520] Some touched the lower\r\npoint of the slip with cedar oil which prevented it from decaying, and\r\nlikewise by its odour repelled vermin.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1515:\r\n\r\n  Virg.

This practice is noticed by Lord Bacon who advises\r\n  gardeners to extend the experiment by laying “good store” of other\r\n  kernels about the roots of trees of the same kind. Sylva Sylvarum, i.\r\n  35.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1519:\r\n\r\n  Virg. Georg. ii. 348.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1520:\r\n\r\n  A similar remark is made by Lord Bacon: “It is an assured experience,”\r\n  he says, “that an heap of flint or stone laid about the bottom of a\r\n  wild tree, as an oak, elm, ash, &c., upon the first planting, doth\r\n  make it prosper double as much as without it. The cause is for that it\r\n  retaineth the moisture which falleth at any time upon the tree and\r\n  suffereth it not to be exhaled by the sun.” Sylva Sylvarum, 422.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo produce grapes without stones the lower end of the slip was split,\r\nand the pith carefully extracted with an ear-pick.[1521] It was then\r\nbound round with a papyrus leaf, thrust into a sea-onion and thus\r\nplanted. Vines producing medicinal grapes were created by withdrawing\r\nthe pith from the lower part of the slip, but without splitting, and\r\nintroducing certain drugs into the hollow,[1522] closing up the\r\nextremity with papyrus and thus setting it in the earth. The wine, the\r\ngrape, the leaves, and even the ashes of such a vine were thought to be\r\na remedy against the bite of serpents and dogs, though no security\r\nagainst hydrophobia. Another mode of producing stoneless grapes was to\r\ncut short all the branches of a vine already growing, extract the pith\r\nfrom the ends of them, and fill up the cavity once a-week with the juice\r\nof sylphion,[1523] binding them carefully to props that the liquor might\r\nnot escape. A method was also in use of producing green and purple\r\ngrapes on the same cluster.[1524] This was to take two slips as nearly\r\nas possible of the same size, the one of the white, the other of the\r\nblack grape, and, having split them down the middle, carefully to fit\r\nthe halves to their opposites, so that the buds, when divided, should\r\nexactly meet. They were then bound tight together with papyrus thread,\r\nand placed in the earth in a sea-onion,[1525] whose glutinous juice\r\naided the growing together of the severed parts. Sometimes instead of\r\nslips, offshoots removed from the trunk of a large vine, with roots\r\nattached to them, were used. On other occasions the vine was grafted,\r\nlike any other fruit-tree, on a variety of stocks,[1526] each modifying\r\nthe quality and flavour of the grape. Thus a vine grafted on a\r\nmyrtle-stock,[1527] produced fruit partaking of the character of the\r\nmyrtle-berry. Grafted on a cherry-tree, its grapes underwent a different\r\nchange, and ripened, like cherries, in the spring. As the clay\r\nencircling the junctures of these grafts grew dry, and somewhat cracked\r\nin hot summers, it was customary for gardeners to moisten them every\r\nevening with a sponge dipped in water.[1528]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1521:\r\n\r\n  Geop. iv. 7.

In order, when forming a nursery,[1529] to coax the young\r\nplants to grow, the beds to which they were transferred, were formed of\r\na stratum of earth brought from the vineyard whence they also were\r\ntaken. Another nicety was to take care, that they occupied precisely the\r\nsame position with respect to the quarters of the heavens[1530] as when\r\ngrowing on the parent stock.[1531]\r\n\r\n             “Besides to plant it as it was they mark\r\n             The heaven’s four quarters on the tender bark,\r\n             And to the north or south restore the side\r\n             Which at their birth did heat or cold abide,\r\n             So strong is custom; such effects can use\r\n             In tender souls of pliant plants produce.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1529:\r\n\r\n  Virg.

Georg. ii. 270, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen desirous of extending the plantation in an old vineyard, instead of\r\nthe methods above described, they had recourse to another, which was to\r\nbend down[1532] the vine branch, and bury it up to the point in the\r\nearth, where it would take root, and send forth a new vine, and in this\r\nway a long series of leafy arcades[1533] may sometimes have been formed.\r\nAt the foot of their vines some cultivators were in the habit of burying\r\nthree goats’ horns[1534] with their points downwards, and the other end\r\nappearing above the soil. These they regarded as so many receptacles for\r\nreceiving and gradually conveying water to the roots, and, consequently,\r\nan active cause of the vines’ fertility.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1532:\r\n\r\n  An analogous practice is observed in the pepper gardens of\r\n  Sumatra:—“When the vines originally planted to any of the chinkareens\r\n  (or props) are observed to fail or miss; instead of replacing them\r\n  with new plants, they frequently conduct one of the shoots, or\r\n  suckers, from a neighbouring vine, to the spot, through a trench made\r\n  in the ground, and there suffer it to rise up anew, often at the\r\n  distance of twelve or fourteen feet from the parent stock.” Marsden,\r\n  History of Sumatra, p. 111.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1533:\r\n\r\n  Virg.

To these\r\nvarieties of practice Virgil makes allusion,—\r\n\r\n           When winter frosts constrain the field with cold,\r\n           The fainty root can take no steady hold;\r\n           But when the golden spring reveals the year,\r\n           And the white bird returns whom serpents fear,\r\n           That season deem the best to plant thy vines;\r\n           Next that, is when autumnal warmth declines,\r\n           Ere heat is quite decayed, or cold begun,\r\n           Or Capricorn admits the winter sun.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1535:\r\n\r\n  Geop. v. 7, seq.

Some planted during the four days immediately succeeding the\r\nbirth of the new moon, while others extended their labours through the\r\nfirst two quarters.

Sylva\r\n  Sylvarum, 623.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nVine-props[1542] appear to have commonly consisted of short reeds,\r\nwhich, accordingly, were extensively cultivated both in Hellas and its\r\ncolonies of Northern Africa, where the musical cicada, whose excessive\r\nmultiplication betokened a sickly year, bored through the rind, and laid\r\nits eggs in the hollow within.[1543] From an inconvenience attending the\r\nuse of this kind of support came the rustic proverb, “The prop has\r\ndefrauded the vine;”[1544] for these reeds sometimes took root, outgrew\r\ntheir clients, and monopolized the moisture of the soil.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1542:\r\n\r\n  Geop. v. 22. 27.

Where reeds were\r\nnot procurable, ash-props[1547] were substituted, but they were always\r\ncarefully barked, to prevent cantharides, and other insects hurtful to\r\nthe vine, from making nests in them. Their price would appear to have\r\nbeen considerable, since we find a husbandman speaking of having laid\r\nout a hundred drachma in vine-props.[1548] To prevent their speedily\r\ndecaying they were smeared a-top with pitch, and carefully, after the\r\nvintage, collected and laid up within doors.[1549]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1545:\r\n\r\n  Geop. v. 27.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1546:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

As the lower boughs of these noble trees were carefully\r\nlopped away, a series of lofty arches was created, beneath which the\r\nbreezes could freely play, abundant currents of pure air being regarded\r\nas no less essential to the perfect maturing of the grape[1556] than\r\nconstant sunshine. Sometimes the vine, in its ascent, was suffered to\r\nwind round the trunk of its supporter, which, however, by the most\r\njudicious husbandmen, was considered prejudicial, since the profusion of\r\nligatures which it threw out in its passage upwards was thought to\r\nexhaust too much of its strength, to prevent which wooden wedges[1557]\r\nwere here and there inserted between the vine stem and the tree. In\r\ntrailing the branches, moreover, along the boughs, care was taken to\r\nkeep them as much as possible on the upper side, that they might enjoy a\r\ngreater amount of sunshine, and be the more exposed to be agitated by\r\nthe winds.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1555:\r\n\r\n  Gœttling ad Hesiod.

It should seem that powdring when a shower cometh maketh a\r\n  kind of soiling to the tree, being earth and water finely laid on. And\r\n  they note that countries where the fields and waies are dusty bear the\r\n  best vines.” Sylva Sylvarum, 666.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1557:\r\n\r\n  Geop. iv. 1. 16.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese Anadendrades,[1558] which were supposed to produce the best and\r\nmost lasting wines, probably, as at present, ripened their produce much\r\nlater than the other sorts of vines on account of the trees by which\r\nthey were shaded. In modern Crete,[1559] where, however, they are never\r\npruned, their grapes seldom ripen before November, and sometimes they\r\nfurnish the bazaar of Khania with fresh supplies till Christmas. The\r\nsame is the case also in Egypt.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1558:\r\n\r\n  These vines were likewise called ἁμαμάξυες. Aristoph. Vesp. 325, et\r\n  Schol.

At Populonium, in Etruria, there was a statue of\r\nJupiter carved from a single vine; the pillars of the temple of Hera, at\r\nMetapontum, consisted of so many vines; and the whole staircase leading\r\nto the roof of the fane of Artemis, at Ephesos, was constructed with the\r\ntimber of a single vine from Cypros. To render these things credible, we\r\nare informed, that, at Arambys, in Africa,[1560] there was a vine twelve\r\nfeet in circumference, and modern travellers have found them of equal\r\ndimensions in other parts of the world.[1561] In France, for example,\r\nthe celebrated Anne, Duc de Montmorenci, had a table made with a single\r\nslab of vinewood, which, two hundred years afterwards, Brotier[1562] saw\r\npreserved at the town of Ecouen.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1559:\r\n\r\n  On the vines of this island cf.

In other cases these intervals\r\nwere given up to the cultivation of fruit-trees, such as the\r\npomegranate, the apple, the quince, and the olive. The fig-tree was\r\nregarded as pernicious, though often planted in rows on the outside of\r\nthe vineyard.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1563:\r\n\r\n  Geop. iv. 1. v. 7, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1564:\r\n\r\n  Barley and other grain are still in modern times sown between the\r\n  vines in Asia Minor.

Plant. ii. 18. 4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRespecting those vines which were cultivated without the aid of\r\nprops,[1567] or trees, we possess little information, except that there\r\nwere such. But, as they are still found in the country, it is probable,\r\nthat the mode of dressing them now prevailing nearly resembles that of\r\nantiquity. They are generally, in Syria, planted along the steep sides\r\nof mountains, where they spread and rest upon the stones, and have their\r\nfruit early ripened by the heat reflected from the earth. Frequently,\r\nalso, they are planted on more level ground, in which case, as soon as\r\nthe grapes acquire any size, the husbandman passes through the vineyard\r\nwith an armful of forked wooden props which he skilfully introduces\r\nbeneath the branches and fixes firmly so as to keep the clusters from\r\ntouching the mould. The reason for adopting this method is the furious\r\nwinds which at certain seasons of the year prevail in many of the\r\nGrecian islands, preventing the growth of woods and prostrating the fig\r\nand every other fruit-tree to the earth. The spaces between the lines\r\nare turned up annually by a peculiar sort of plough[1568] drawn by oxen,\r\nin front of which a man advances, lifting up the vines and holding them\r\naside while they pass. This destroys the weeds, and, at the same time,\r\nall the upper roots of the vine, which compels it to descend deeper into\r\nthe earth, where it finds a cooler and more abundant nourishment. In\r\nthis respect the practice of the Syrotes closely resembles that of their\r\nancestors. Some husbandmen were careful, likewise, while weeding,[1569]\r\nto remove the larger stones, though they are often supposed, by\r\npreserving moisture, to do more good than harm.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1567:\r\n\r\n  This creeping vine, cultivated _sine ridicis_, was common in Spain.\r\n  Varro, i. 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1568:\r\n\r\n  Della Rocca, Traité Complet sur les Abeilles, t. i. p. 203, sqq.

Thus they maintained it was the ass that, by browsing\r\non the extremities of the vine, which only made it bear the more\r\nluxuriantly, taught them the art of pruning as well perhaps as that of\r\nfeeding on the tendrils and tender branches,[1570] which among them were\r\nesteemed a delicacy. To manifest their gratitude for this piece of\r\ninstruction they erected at Nauplia,[1571] a marble statue in honour of\r\nthis ill-used quadruped, who has seldom, I fear, from that day to this,\r\nbeen so well treated. The rules observed in pruning[1572] resembling\r\nthose still in use, it is unnecessary to repeat them, though it may be\r\nworth mentioning, that the husbandman, who coveted an abundant vintage,\r\nwas careful to lop his vines[1573] with his brows shaded by an ivy\r\ncrown. They esteemed it a sign of a fruitful year when the fig-tree and\r\nthe white vine put forth luxuriantly in spring,[1574] after which they\r\nhad only to petition the gods against too much rain, or too much\r\ndrought,[1575] and those terrible hailstorms which sometimes devastate\r\nwhole districts. Against this calamity, however, they had a\r\npreservative, which was to bind an amulet in the shape of a thong of\r\nseal-hide or eagle’s wing, about one of the stocks,[1576] after which\r\nthe whole vineyard was supposed to be secure from injury. The same\r\neffect was produced by striking a chalezite stone with a piece of iron\r\non the approach of a storm, and by hanging up in the vineyard a picture\r\nof a bunch of grapes at the setting of the constellation of the\r\nLyre.[1577] To repel the ascent of vermin along the trunk it was smeared\r\nwith a thick coat of bitumen,[1578] imported from Cilicia, while to\r\npreserve the branches from wasps a little olive-oil was blown over\r\nthem.[1579]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1570:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

But this partial\r\ngathering of the grapes could only take place in their gardens, or where\r\nthe vine was trained about the house; for in the regular vineyards the\r\nseason of the vintage was regulated by law,[1581] as in Burgundy and the\r\nsouth of France, in order to protect the public against the pernicious\r\nfrauds which would otherwise be practised. This, in Attica, usually\r\ncoincided with the heliacal rising of the constellation Arcturus.[1582]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1580:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph.

Geop. i. 9. 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen the magistrate had declared that the season of the vintage[1583]\r\nwas come, the servants of Bacchos hurried forth to the vine-clad hills,\r\nconverting their labours into a pretext for superabundant mirth and\r\nrevelry. The troops of vintagers, composed of youths and maidens, with\r\ncrowns of ivy on their heads, and accompanied by rural performers on the\r\nflute or phorminx, moved forward with shout, and dance, and song, to the\r\nsacred enclosures of Dionysos, surrounded with plaited hedgerows, and\r\nblue streamlets.[1584] Here, where\r\n\r\n                    “——the showering grapes\r\n                  In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth\r\n                  Purple and gushing,”\r\n\r\nthey at once commenced their joyous task. With sharp pruning-hooks[1585]\r\nthey separated the luxuriant clusters, gold or purple, from the vine,\r\nand piling them in plaited baskets of osier or reed, bore them on their\r\nshoulders to the wine-press. In this operation, as I have said, both men\r\nand women joined; but the press was trodden by men only,[1586] who, half\r\nintoxicated by pleasure,[1587] and the fumes of the young wine, chanted\r\nloudly their ancient national lays in praise of Bacchos.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1583:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

On the modern modes of gathering the grapes,\r\n  see Redding Hist. of Modern Wines, chap. ii. 26, et seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1586:\r\n\r\n  The practice is still the same in the Levant:—“The vintage was now\r\n  begun, the black grapes being spread on the ground in beds exposed to\r\n  the sun to dry for raisins; while in another part, the juice was\r\n  expressed for wine, a man with feet and legs bare, treading the fruit\r\n  in a kind of cistern, with a hole or vent near the bottom, and a\r\n  vessel beneath it to receive the liquor.” Chandler, ii. p. 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe wine-press, which stood under cover, sometimes consisted of two\r\nupright, and many cross beams,[1588] which, descending with great weight\r\nupon the grapes squeezed forth all their juices, and these falling\r\nthrough a species of strainer,[1589] upon an inclined slab, were poured\r\nthrough a small channel formed for the purpose, into a broad open vessel\r\ncommunicating with the vat. Into the process of wine-making[1590] it is\r\nunnecessary to enter. It will be sufficient, perhaps, to say that, when\r\nmade, it was laid up in skins or large earthen jars until required for\r\nuse. The wines of modern Attica and the Morea[1591] are preserved from\r\nbecoming acid by a large infusion of resin.[1592]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1587:\r\n\r\n  Anacreon, Od. 52.

Vesp. 878.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe sports,[1593] which took place during the vintage, were loud and\r\nfrolicsome, and distinguished sometimes for their excessive licence.\r\nThey brought forth a number of wine skins, filled tight, to the village\r\ngreen, and there smearing them liberally with oil the staggering rustics\r\nsought, each in his turn, to leap and stand upon one of them with his\r\nnaked foot.[1594] The missing, slipping, and falling, the awkward figure\r\nthey sometimes made upon the ground, the jokes, and shouts, and laughter\r\nof the bystanders, mingled with the twanging of rustic instruments, and\r\nthe roar of Bacchanalian songs, constituted the charm of the rural\r\nDionysia, out of which, through many changes and gradations, arose, as\r\nwe have seen, the Greek drama. In order without shame to give the freer\r\nlicence to their tongues, they sometimes covered their faces with masks,\r\nformed with the bark of trees, which, there can be no doubt, led to\r\nthose afterwards employed in the theatre. Sometimes a sort of\r\nfarce[1595] was acted, representing the search of the Athenians for the\r\nbodies of Icarios and Erygone. The former, according to tradition, was\r\nthe person who taught the inhabitants of Attica the use of wine, with\r\nwhich on a certain occasion he regaled a number of shepherds. These\r\ndemi-savages, observing their strength and their reason fail, imagined\r\nthemselves to have been poisoned, and falling, in revenge, upon the\r\ndonor, put him to death. His dog Mœra escaped, and leading Erygone to\r\nthe spot where her father had been murdered, she immediately hung\r\nherself on the discovery of the corpse. Upon this they were all\r\ntransported to the skies, and changed into so many constellations,\r\nnamely Boötes,[1596] the Dog, and the Virgin, by whose brilliancy we are\r\nstill rejoiced nightly. Soon afterwards the maidens of Attica were\r\nseized with madness and hung themselves in great numbers, upon which the\r\noracle being consulted, commanded the Athenians to make search for the\r\nbodies of Icarios and Erygone. Being able to discover them nowhere on\r\nearth, they suspended ropes from the branches of lofty trees, by\r\nswinging to and fro on which they appeared to be conducting their search\r\nin the air; but many of these adventurous explorers receiving severe\r\nfalls, they were afterwards contented with suspending to the ropes\r\nlittle images after their own likeness, which they sent hither and\r\nthither in the air as their substitutes.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1593:\r\n\r\n  Virg.

For\r\nthis purpose, there was in every vineyard, garden, and orchard, a place\r\ncalled Theilopedon,[1599] which would seem to have been a smooth raised\r\nterrace, where not grapes only, but myrtle-berries, and every other kind\r\nof fruit, were exposed to the sun on fine hurdles. Here, likewise, the\r\nberries of the Palma Christi[1600] were prepared for the making of\r\ncastor oil. Another method was to twist the stem of the cluster[1601]\r\nand allow the grapes to dry on the vine. They were then laid up in\r\nvessels among vine leaves, dried also in the sun, covered close with a\r\nstopper, and deposited in a cold room free from smoke.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1597:\r\n\r\n  Geop. iv. 15.

This we find is still the practice in the islands of the\r\n  Archipelago, for the purpose of making sweet wine. M. l’ Abbé della\r\n  Rocca, who mentions it, enumerates at the same time the most delicious\r\n  sorts of grapes now cultivated in Greece—“On peut juger si les vins y\r\n  sont exquis, et si les anciens eurent raison d’appeller Naxie l’île de\r\n  Bacchus. Les raisins y sont monstrueux, et il arrive souvent que dans\r\n  un repas, on n’en sert qu’un seul pour le fruit; mais aussi\r\n  couvre-t-il toute la profondeur d’un grand bassin: les grains en sont\r\n  gros comme nos damas noirs. Il y a dans les îles des raisins de plus\r\n  de vingt sortes: les muscats de Ténédos et de Samos l’emportent sur\r\n  tous les autres; ceux de Ténédos sont plus ambrés; ceux de Samos, plus\r\n  délicats. Les Sentorinois, pour donner une saveur plus exquise à leurs\r\n  raisins, leur tordent la queue lorsqu’ils commencent à mûrir; après\r\n  quelques jours d’un soleil ardent, les raisins deviennent à demi\r\n  flétris, ce qui fait un vin dont ceux de la Cieutat et de\r\n  Saint-Laurent n’approchent pas. Les autres sortes de raisins sont\r\n  _l’aïdhoni_, petit raisin blanc qu’on mange vers la mi-juillet; le\r\n  _samia,_ gros raisin blanc qu’on fait sécher; le siriqui, ainsi nommé\r\n  parce qu’il a le goût de la cerise; _l’ætonychi_, qui a la figure de\r\n  l’ongle d’un aigle, et qui est très savoureux; le malvoisie, le muscat\r\n  violet, le corinthe, et plusieurs autres dont les noms me sont\r\n  échappés.” Traité sur les Abeilles, t. i. p. 6, seq. Speaking of the\r\n  prodigious productiveness of vines, Columella mentions one which bore\r\n  upwards of two thousand clusters, De Re Rust. iii. 3. A vine producing\r\n  a fifth of this quantity has been thought extraordinary in modern\r\n  Egypt: “Il n’est pas croyable combien rapporte un seul pied de vigne.\r\n  Il y en a un dans la maison Consulaire de France, qui a porté 436\r\n  grosses grappes de raisin, et qui en donne ordinairement 300.”—De\r\n  Maillet, Description de l’Egypte, p. 17.* In the Grecian Archipelago,\r\n  however, the vine has been known to yield still more abundantly than\r\n  in Egypt: “On a compté pendant trois ans consécutifs, cent\r\n  trente-quatre grappes de raisin sur une souche; et sur un autre cep de\r\n  vigne planté dans un terrain très-gras, on a compté jusqu’à quatre\r\n  cent quatre-vingts grappes; et l’intendant de l’évêché de notre île\r\n  m’a plus d’une fois assuré qu’on avoit fait soixante-quinze bouteilles\r\n  de vin, avec le raisin d’un seul cep.” Della Rocca, t. i. p. 65.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo preserve the grapes fresh some cut off with a sharp pruninghook the\r\nclusters separately, others the branches on which they grew, after\r\nwhich, dipping the stem into pitch and removing the damaged grapes with\r\na pair of scissors, they spread them in cool and shady rooms, on layers\r\nof pulse-halm, or hay, or straw.[1602] The halm of lentils was usually\r\npreferred, because it is hard and dry, and repels mice. On other\r\noccasions, the branches were kept suspended, having sometimes been\r\npreviously dipped in sweet wine. Grapes were likewise preserved in\r\npitched coffers, immersed in dry saw-dust of the pitch tree, or the\r\nsilver fir, or the black poplar, or even in millet flour. Others plunged\r\nthe bunches in boiling sea-water, or if this were not at hand, into a\r\npreparation of wine, salt, and water, and then laid them up in barley\r\nstraw. Others boiled the ashes of the fig-tree, or the vine, with which\r\nthey sprinkled the bunches. Others preserved grapes by suspending them\r\nin granaries, where the grain beneath was occasionally moved, for the\r\ndust rising from the corn settled on the outside of the clusters, and\r\nprotected them from the air. Another method was to boil rain-water to a\r\nthird, and then, after cooling it in the open air, and pouring it into a\r\npitched vessel, to fill it with clusters perfectly cleansed. The vessel\r\nwas then covered, luted with gypsum, and laid by in a cold place. The\r\ngrapes in this way remained quite fresh, and the water itself acquiring\r\na vinous taste was administered to sick persons in lieu of wine.\r\nOccasionally, also, grapes as well as apples were kept in honey.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1602:\r\n\r\n  Geop. iv. 15. 4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary, and perhaps the most effectual\r\ncontrivance,[1603] however, was to dig near the vine a pit three feet\r\ndeep, the bottom of which was covered with a layer of sand. A few short\r\nstakes were then fixed upright in it, and to these a number of vine\r\nbranches laden with clusters were bent down and made fast. The whole was\r\nthen closely roofed over so as completely to keep out the rain, and in\r\nthis way the grapes would remain fresh till spring.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1603:\r\n\r\n  Geop. iv. 11. Pallad. xii. 12.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe labours of the vintage being concluded, the husbandman next turned\r\nhis attention to olive gathering and the making of oil. This, in Greece,\r\nwas a matter of great importance. The olives, therefore,[1604] for all\r\nthe better sorts of oil, were picked by hand, and not, as in Italy,\r\nsuffered to fall. When as many were gathered as could conveniently be\r\npressed during the following night and day, they were spread loosely on\r\nfine hurdles, and not heaped up lest they should heat and lose the\r\ndelicacy of their flavour. They were, likewise, cleansed carefully from\r\nleaves and every particle of wood, these substances, it was supposed,\r\nimpairing the quality and durability of the oil. Towards evening a\r\nlittle salt was sprinkled over the olives, which were then put into a\r\nclean mill,[1605] and so arranged that they could be bruised without\r\ncrushing the stones, from the juice of which the oil contracted a bad\r\ntaste. Having been sufficiently bruised, they were conveyed in small\r\nvessels to the press, where they were covered with hurdles of green\r\nwillows, upon which, at first, was placed a moderate weight,—for that\r\nwhich flows from slight pressure is the sweetest and purest oil, on\r\nwhich account it was drawn off in clean leaden vessels,[1606] and\r\npreserved apart. Greater weight was then added, and the mass having been\r\nwell writhen, the second runnings were laid up in separate vessels. The\r\nnext step was to cause the precipitation of the lees, which was effected\r\nby mingling with the crude oil a little salt and nitre. It was then\r\nstirred with a piece of olive-wood, and left to settle, when the amurca\r\nor watery part sank to the bottom. The pure oil was then skimmed off\r\nwith a shell, and laid up in glass vases, this substance having been\r\npreferred on account of its cold nature. In default of these,\r\npickle-jars, glazed with gypsum, were used, which were deposited in cool\r\ncellars facing the north.[1607]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1604:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ix. 19. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1605:\r\n\r\n  The fruit of the terebinth was ground, like the olive, in a mill, for\r\n  the making of oil. The kernels were used in feeding pigs, or for fuel.\r\n  Geop. ix. 18.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1606:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Cato, De Re Rust. 66. This clear pure oil, sometimes rendered\r\n  odoriferous by perfumes, (Il. ψ. 186,) was chiefly employed in\r\n  lubricating the body. Thus we find the virgin in Hesiod anointing her\r\n  limbs with olive-oil to defend herself from the winter’s cold. Opp. et\r\n  Dies, 519, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1607:\r\n\r\n  Vitruv. vi. 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Greeks had a variety of other oils besides that procured from the\r\nolive,[1608] as walnut-oil, oil of terebinth, oil of sesamum, oil of\r\nviolets, oil of almonds, oil of Palma Christi, or castor-oil, oil of\r\nsaffron, oil of Cnidian laurel, oil of datura, oil of lentisk, oil of\r\nmastic, oil of myrtle, and oil of mustard. They had, likewise,[1609] the\r\ngreen and wild-olive oil, and the double-refined oil of Sicyon, together\r\nwith imitations of the Spanish and Italian oils.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1608:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ix. 18.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1609:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ix. 19, seq. iii. 13. Dioscor. i. 140.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs fruit of all kinds was in great request among the Greeks, they had\r\nrecourse to numerous contrivances[1610] for ensuring an unfailing supply\r\nthroughout the year. At many of these our gardeners may, perhaps, smile,\r\nbut they were, nevertheless, most of them ingenious, and, probably,\r\neffectual, though the fruit thus preserved may have been dear when\r\nbrought to market. Into the details of all their methods it will be\r\nunnecessary to enter: the following were the principal and most curious.\r\nWalnuts, chestnuts, filberts, &c., were gathered and kept in the\r\nordinary way. They understood the art of blanching almonds, which were\r\nafterwards dried in the sun. Medlars, service-berries, winter-apples,\r\nand the like, having been gathered carefully, were simply laid up in\r\nstraw, whether on the loft-floor or in baskets. This, likewise, was\r\nsometimes the case with quinces, which, together with apples and pears,\r\nwere, on other occasions, deposited in dry fig-leaves. For these, in the\r\ncase of pears and apples, walnut-leaves were often substituted,\r\nsometimes piled under and over them in heaps, at other times wrapped and\r\ntied about the fruit, the hues and odours of which they were supposed\r\ngreatly to improve.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1610:\r\n\r\n  Geop. x. 10–70. Cf. Mazois, Pal. de Scaurus, p. 182, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCitrons,[1611] pomegranates,[1612] apples, quinces, and pears, were\r\npreserved in heaps of sand, grapestones, oak, poplar, deal, or cedar\r\nsawdust, sometimes sprinkled with vinegar, chopped straw, wheat, or\r\nbarley, or the seeds of plants, all of which sufficed equally to exclude\r\nthe external air. Another method with apples[1613] was to lay them up\r\nsurrounded with sea-weed in unbaked jars, which were then deposited in\r\nan upper room free from smoke and all bad smells. When sea-weed was not\r\nprocurable they put each apple into a small separate jar closely covered\r\nup and luted. These apple-jars were often lined with a coating of wax.\r\nFigs were, in like manner, preserved green[1614] by being enclosed in so\r\nmany small gourds. Citrons and pomegranates were often suffered to\r\nremain throughout the winter on the tree, defended from wet and wind by\r\nbeing capped with little fictile vases bound tightly to the branches to\r\nkeep them steady. Others enclosed these fruits, as well as apples, in a\r\nthick coating of gypsum, preventing their falling off by binding the\r\nstem to the branches with packthread. Nor was it unusual, even when\r\ngathered, to envelope apples, quinces, and citrons, in a covering of the\r\nsame material, or potter’s clay, or argillaceous earth, mixed with hair,\r\nsometimes interposing between the fruit and this crust a layer of\r\nfig-leaves, after which they were dried in the sun. When at the end,\r\nperhaps, of a whole year the above crust was broken and removed the\r\nfruit came forth perfect as when plucked from the bough. It is possible,\r\ntherefore, that, in a similar manner, mangoes, mangusteens, and other\r\nfrail and delicate fruit of the tropics, might be brought fresh to\r\nEurope, and that, too, in such abundance as to make them accessible to\r\nmost persons. To render pears and pomegranates durable, their stems were\r\ndipped in pitch, after which they were hung up. In the case of the\r\nlatter the fruit itself was sometimes thus dipped; and, at other times,\r\nimmersed in hot sea-water, after which it was dried in the sun. One mode\r\nof preserving figs was to plunge them in honey so as neither to touch\r\neach other, nor the vessel in which they were contained; another, to\r\ncover a pile of them with an inverted vase of glass, or other pellucid\r\nsubstance, closely luted to the slab on which it stood. Cherries were\r\ngathered before sunrise, and put, with summer savory above and below,\r\ninto a jar, or the hollow of a reed, which was then filled with sweet\r\nvinegar, and closely covered. Mulberries were preserved in their own\r\njuice, apples and quinces in pitched coffers, wrapped in clean locks of\r\nwool, pears by being placed in salt[1615] for five days, and afterwards\r\ndried in the sun, as were also figs, which were strung by the stalks to\r\na piece of cord or willow twig, like so many hanks of onions[1616] as\r\nthey are sold in modern times. Elsewhere they were preserved, as dates\r\nin Egypt, by being pressed together in square masses, like bricks.[1617]\r\nDamascenes were kept in must or sweet wine, as were also pears, adding\r\nsometimes a little salt and jujubes, with leaves, above and below. The\r\nsame course was pursued with apples and quinces, which communicated to\r\nthe liquor additional durability and the most exquisite fragrance.\r\nQuinces, whose sharp effluvia prevented their being placed with other\r\nfruit, were often put into closely-covered jars, and kept floating in\r\nwine to which they imparted a delicious perfume. The same custom was\r\nobserved with respect to figs, which were cut off on the bearing branch\r\na little before they were ripe, and hung, so as not to touch each other,\r\nin a square earthen jar. Upon the same principle apples were preserved\r\nin jars hermetically sealed, which, for the sake of coolness, were\r\nplunged in cisterns or deep wells.[1618]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1611:\r\n\r\n  Palladius, iv. 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1612:\r\n\r\n  We find mention in modern times of a species of pomegranate, the\r\n  kernels of which are without stones, peculiar apparently to the island\r\n  of Scio. “It is usual to bring them to table, in a plate, sprinkled\r\n  with rose-water.” Chandler, i. 58.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1613:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Indeed, throughout Greece, there\r\nprevailed a similar taste. Every one was eager to instruct and be\r\ninstructed; and so great in consequence was the demand for treatises on\r\nhusbandry, theoretical and practical, that numerous writers, the names\r\nof fifty of whom are preserved by Varro,[1621] made it the object of\r\ntheir study. Others without committing the result of their experience to\r\nwriting, devoted themselves wholly to its practical improvement. They\r\npurchased waste or ill-cultivated lands, and, by investigating the\r\nnature of the soil, skilfully adapting their crops to it, manuring,\r\nirrigating, and draining, converted a comparative desert into a\r\nproductive estate.[1622] We can possibly, as Dr. Johnson insists,\r\nimprove very little our knowledge of agriculture by erudite researches\r\ninto the methods of the ancients; though Milton was of opinion, that\r\neven here some useful hints might be obtained. In describing, however,\r\nwhat the Greeks did, I am not pretending to enlighten the present age,\r\nbut to enable it to enjoy its superiority by instituting a comparison\r\nwith the ruder practices of antiquity.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1621:\r\n\r\n  De Re Rusticâ, i. 1. Cf. Colum. i. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1622:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph. Œconom. xx. 22, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAlready in those times the men of experience and routine,[1623] had\r\nbegun to vent their sneers against philosophers for their profound\r\nresearches into the nature of soils,[1624] in which, however, they by no\r\nmeans designed to engage the husbandman, but only to present him, in\r\nbrief and intelligible maxims, with the fruit of their labours.\r\nNevertheless the practical husbandman went to work a shorter way. He\r\nobserved his neighbour’s grounds,[1625] saw what throve in this soil,\r\nwhat in the other, what was bettered by irrigation, what in this respect\r\nmight safely be left to the care of Heaven; and thus, in a brief space,\r\nacquired a rough theory wherewith to commence operations. An\r\nagriculturist, the Athenians thought, required no recondite erudition,\r\nthough to his complete success the exercise of much good sense and\r\ncareful observation was necessary. Every man would, doubtless, know in\r\nwhat seasons of the year he must plough and sow and reap, that lands\r\nexhausted by cultivation must be suffered to lie fallow, that change of\r\ncrops is beneficial to the soil, and so on. But the great art consists\r\nin nicely adapting each operation to the varying march of the seasons,\r\nin converting accidents to use, in rendering the winds, the showers, the\r\nsunshine, subservient to your purposes, in mastering the signs of the\r\nweather, and guarding as far as possible against the injuries sustained\r\nfrom storms of rain or hail.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1623:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Opp. et Dies, 21, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere was in circulation among the Greeks a small body of precepts,\r\naddressed more especially to husbandmen, designed to promote the real\r\nobject of civilisation. Quaint, no doubt, and ineffably commonplace,\r\nthey will now appear, but they served, nevertheless, in early and rude\r\ntimes, to soften the manners and regulate the conduct of the rustic\r\nHellenes. Who first began to collect and preserve them is, of course,\r\nunknown; they are thickly sprinkled through the works of Hesiod,[1626]\r\nand impart to them an air of moral dignity which relieves the monotony\r\nthat would otherwise result from a mere string of agricultural maxims.\r\nThe chief aim of the poet seems to be, to promote peace and good\r\nneighbourhood, to multiply among the inhabitants of the fields occasions\r\nof joining the “rough right hand,”[1627] to apply the sharp spur to\r\nindustry, and thus to augment the stores, and, along with them, the\r\ncontentment, of his native land. Be industrious, exclaims the poet, for\r\nfamine is the companion of the idle. Labour confers fertility on flocks\r\nand herds, and is the parent of opulence. He who toils is beloved by\r\ngods[1628] and men, while the idle hand is the object of their aversion.\r\nThe slothful man envies the prosperity of his neighbour; but glory is\r\nthe reward of virtue. Prudence heaps up that which profligacy\r\ndissipates. Be hospitable to the stranger, for he who repels the\r\nsuppliant from his door is no less guilty than the adulterer, than the\r\ndespoiler of the orphan, or the wretch who blasphemes his aged parent on\r\nthe brink of the grave: of such men the end is miserable, when Zeus\r\nrains down vengeance upon them in recompense for their evil actions. Be\r\nmindful that thou offer up victims to the gods with pure hands and holy\r\nthoughts,—to pour libations in their temples, adorn their altars, and\r\nrender them propitious to thee in all things. When about to ascend thy\r\ncouch to enjoy sweet sleep, and when the sacred light of the day-spring\r\nfirst appears, omit not to demand of heaven a pure heart and a cheerful\r\nmind, with the means of extending thy possessions, and protection from\r\nloss. When thou makest a feast, invite thy friends and thy neighbours,\r\nand in times of trouble they will run to thy assistance half-clad, while\r\nthy relations will tarry to buckle on their girdles. Borrow of thy\r\nneighbour, but, in repaying him, exceed rather than fall short of what\r\nis his due. Rise betimes. Every little makes a mickle. Store is no sore.\r\nHoused corn breaks no sleep. Drink largely the top and the bottom of the\r\njar; be sparing of the middle:[1629] it is niggardly to stint your\r\nfriends when the wine runs low. Do unto others as they do unto\r\nyou.—These seeds of morality are simple, as I have said, and far from\r\nrecondite; but they produced the warriors of Marathon and Platæa, and\r\npreserved for ages the freedom and the independence of Greece.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1626:\r\n\r\n  Opp. et Dies, 298, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1627:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

Plut. Sympos. vii. 3.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe other branches of an Hellenic farmer’s studies comprehended\r\nsomething like the elements of natural philosophy,—the influence of the\r\nsun and moon, the rising and setting of the stars, the motion of the\r\nwinds, the generation and effects of dews, clouds, meteors, showers and\r\ntempests, the origin of springs and fountains, and the migrations and\r\nhabits of birds and other animals. In addition to these things, it was\r\nnecessary that he should be acquainted with certain practices, prevalent\r\nfrom time immemorial in his country, and, probably, deriving their\r\norigin from ages beyond the utmost reach of tradition. The source of\r\nthese we usually denominate superstition, though it would, perhaps, be\r\nmore proper to regard them as the offspring of that lively and plastic\r\nfancy which gave birth to poetry and art, and inclined its possessors to\r\ncreate a sort of minor religion, based on a praiseworthy principle, but\r\ndeveloping itself chiefly in observances almost always minute and\r\ntrifling, and sometimes ridiculous. To describe all these at length\r\nwould be beside my present purpose, which only requires that I mention\r\nby the way the more remarkable of those connected especially with\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of soil was called into play both in purchasing estates\r\nand in appropriating their several parts to different kinds of culture.\r\nAccording to their notions, which appear to have been founded on long\r\nexperience, and in most points, I believe, agree with those which still\r\nprevail, a rich black mould, deep, friable, and porous,[1630] which\r\nwould resist equally the effects of rain and drought, was, for all\r\npurposes, the best. Next to this they esteemed a yellow alluvial soil,\r\nand that sweet warm ground which best suited vines, corn, and trees. The\r\nred earth, also, they highly valued, except for timber.\r\n\r\nTheir rules for detecting the character and qualities of the soil appear\r\nto have been judicious. Good land, they thought, might be known even\r\nfrom its appearance, since in drought it cracks not too much, and during\r\nheavy and continued showers becomes not miry, but suffers all the rain\r\nto sink into its bosom. That earth they considered inferior which in\r\ncold weather becomes baked, and is covered on the surface by a\r\nshell-like incrustation. They judged, likewise, of the virtue of the\r\nsoil by the luxuriant or stunted character of its natural\r\nproductions:[1631] thus they augured favourably of those tracts of\r\ncountry which were covered by vast and lofty timber-trees, while such as\r\nproduced only a dwarfed vegetation, consisting of meagre bushes,\r\nscattered thickets, and hungry grass, they reckoned almost worthless.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1630:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 9. In these rich loams, particularly on the banks of the\r\n  Stymphalian and Copaic lakes, wheat has been known to yield a return\r\n  of fifty-fold.

Mem. i. 60.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1631:\r\n\r\n  The pitch-pine indicated a light and hungry soil; the cypress, a\r\n  clayey soil. Philost. Icon. ii. 9. p. 775.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNot content with the testimony of the eye, some husbandmen were\r\naccustomed to consult both the smell and the taste; for, digging a pit\r\nof some depth, they took thence a small quantity of earth, from the\r\nodour of which they drew an opinion favourable or otherwise. But to\r\nrender surety doubly sure, they then threw it into a vase, and poured on\r\nit a quantity of potable water, which they afterwards tasted, inferring\r\nfrom the flavour the fertility or barrenness of the soil. This was the\r\nexperiment most relied on; though many considered that soil sweet which\r\nproduced the basket-rush, the reed, the lotos, and the bramble. On some\r\noccasions they employed another method, which was, to make a small\r\nexcavation, and then, throwing back the earth into the opening whence it\r\nhad been drawn, to observe whether or not it filled the whole\r\ncavity:[1632] if it did so, or left a surplus, the soil was judged to be\r\nexcellent; if not, they regarded it as of little value. Soils possessing\r\nsaline qualities were shunned by the ancients, who carefully avoided\r\nmingling salt with their manure, though lands of this description were\r\nrightly thought to be well adapted to the cultivation of\r\npalm-trees,[1633] which they produce in the greatest perfection,[1634]\r\nas in Phœnicia, Egypt, and the country round Babylon.[1635]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1632:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 11.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1633:\r\n\r\n  The Grecian husbandman, therefore, when planting palm-trees in any\r\n  other than a sandy soil, sprinkled salt on the earth immediately\r\n  around.

Plant. i. 6. 3.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnother art in which the condition of the husbandman required him to be\r\nwell versed was that of discovering the signs of latent springs,[1636]\r\nthe existence of which it was necessary to ascertain before laying the\r\nfoundation of a new farm. The investigation was complicated, and carried\r\non in a variety of ways. First, and most obvious, was the inference\r\ndrawn from plants and the nature of the soil itself; for those grounds,\r\nthey thought, were intersected below by veins of water which bore upon\r\ntheir surface certain tribes of grasses and herbs and bushes, as the\r\ncouch-grass, the broad-leaved plantain, the heliotrope, the red-grass,\r\nthe agnus-castus, the bramble, the horse-tail, or shave-grass, ivy,\r\nbush-calamint, soft and slender reeds,[1637] maiden-hair, the melilot,\r\nditch-dock, cinquefoil, or five leaf-grass, broad-leaved bloodwort, the\r\nrush, nightshade, mil-foil, colt’s-foot or foal’s-foot, trefoil or\r\npond-weed, and the black thistle. Spring-heads were always supposed to\r\nlurk beneath fat and black loam, as, likewise, in a stony soil,\r\nespecially where the rocks are dark and of a ferruginous colour. But in\r\nargillaceous districts, particularly where potter’s-clay abounds, or\r\nwhere there are many pebbles and pumice-stones,[1638] they are of rare\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1636:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 4, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1637:\r\n\r\n  Philost. Icon. ii. 9. p. 775.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1638:\r\n\r\n  Spallanzani, in his scientific Travels in the Two Sicilies, describes\r\n  and explains the cause of the rarity of springs in volcanic countries.\r\n  In some districts among the roots of Ætna the female peasants are\r\n  compelled to travel ten miles, at certain seasons of the year, in\r\n  search of water, a jar of which costs, consequently, almost a day’s\r\n  journey. vol. i. p. 299, sqq. In another part of the same work he\r\n  investigates the origin of springs in the Æolian isles, which he\r\n  illustrates by the example of Stromboli. iv. 128. In this island there\r\n  are two fountains, one of slightly tepid water, at the foot of the\r\n  mountain, the other on its slope. “Je recontrai,” observes Monsieur\r\n  Dolomieu, “à moitié hauteur une source d’eau froide, douce, légère et\r\n  très bonne à boire, qui ne tarit jamais et qui est l’unique ressourse\r\n  des habitans lorsque leurs cîternes sont épuisées et lorsque les\r\n  chaleurs ont desséché une seconde source qui est au pied de la\r\n  montagne ce qui arrive tous les étés.” He then adds with reason:\r\n  “Cette petite fontaine dans ce lieu très élevé au milieu des cendres\r\n  volcaniques, est très remarquable, elle ne peut avoir son réservoir\r\n  que dans une pointe de montagne isolée, toute de sable et de pierres\r\n  poreuses, matières qui ne peuvent point retenir l’eau, puisqu’elles\r\n  sont perméables à la fumée.” Voyage aux Iles de Lipari, t. i. p. 120.\r\n  He then endeavours to account for its existence by evaporation. In the\r\n  island of Saline, among the same Æolian group, there is another\r\n  never-failing spring, which, as some years no rain falls in these\r\n  islands during the space of nine months, has greatly perplexed the\r\n  theories of naturalists. Spallanzani conceives, however, that the\r\n  phenomenon may be explained in the usual way: “It appears to me,” he\r\n  says, “extremely probable, that in the internal parts of an island\r\n  which, like this, is the work of fire, there may be immense caverns\r\n  that may be filled with water by the rains; and that in some of these\r\n  which are placed above the spring, the water may always continue at\r\n  nearly the same height.” Travels in the Two Sicilies, vol. iv. p. 136.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo the above indications they were in most cases careful to add others.\r\nAscending ere sunrise to a higher level than the spot under examination,\r\nthey observed by the first rays and before the light thickened, whether\r\nthey could detect the presence of any exhalations, which were held\r\nunerringly to indicate the presence of springs below. Sometimes\r\ninquisition was made during the bright and clear noon, when the\r\nsubterraneous retreats of the Naiads were supposed in summer to be\r\nbetrayed by cloudlets of thin silvery vapour, and in the winter season\r\nby curling threads of steam. In this way the natives of southern Africa\r\ndiscover the existence of hidden fountains in the desert.[1639] Swarms\r\nof gnats flitting hither and thither, or whirling round and ascending in\r\na column, were regarded as another sign.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1639:\r\n\r\n  Le Vaillant, t. viii. p. 162. Even in the southern provinces of\r\n  France, the discovery of hidden springs is an art of no mean\r\n  importance; and the persons who possess it are regarded as public\r\n  benefactors. Thus, as I learn from my friend M. Louis Froment, of the\r\n  department of the Lot, M. Paramelle, a curé having a living in that\r\n  part of the country, is held in high estimation on account of the\r\n  power he possesses of discovering the lurking retreats of\r\n  spring-heads. He is able, from a certain distance, and without the\r\n  least hesitation, to point out the source of living water, determine\r\n  the depth at which it is to be found, say, without ever falling into\r\n  error, what is the quantity and what the quality of the water. Without\r\n  seeking to penetrate the plan, of which he keeps the secret, his\r\n  countrymen avail themselves of the advantages offered to them; and the\r\n  inhabitants of one village, situated on a calcareous tableland, have\r\n  discovered, by the assistance of M. Paramelle, a source in their\r\n  market-place, whilst before they were compelled to seek water at a\r\n  distance of five miles.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen not entirely satisfied by any of the above means, they had recourse\r\nto the following experiment:[1640] sinking a pit to the depth of about\r\nfour feet and a half, they took a hemispherical pan or lead basin, and\r\nhaving anointed it with oil, and fastened with wax a long flake of wool\r\nto the bottom, placed it inverted in the pit. It was then covered with\r\nearth about a foot deep, and left undisturbed during a whole night. On\r\nits being taken forth in the morning, if the inside of the vessel were\r\ncovered thickly with globules, and the wool were dripping wet, it was\r\nconcluded there were springs beneath, the depth of which they calculated\r\nfrom the scantiness or profusion of the moisture. A similar trial was\r\nmade with a sponge covered with reeds.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1640:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSince most streams and rivers take their rise in lofty table-lands or\r\nmountains, which by the ancients were supposed to be richer in springs\r\nin proportion to the number of their peaks, it would seem to follow,\r\nthat scarcely any country in Europe should be better supplied with water\r\nthan Greece. Experience, however, shows, that this in modern times is\r\nnot the fact, several rivers supposed to have been of great volume in\r\nantiquity, having now dwindled into mere brooks, and innumerable\r\nstreamlets and fountains become altogether dry; on which account the\r\ncredit of Greek writers is often impugned, it being supposed that the\r\nnatural characteristics of the country must necessarily be invariable.\r\nBut this is an error. For the existence of springs and rivulets depends\r\nless perhaps on the presence of mountains than on the prevalence of\r\nforests, as Democritos[1641] long ago observed. Now, from a variety of\r\ncauses, still in active operation, the ridges and hills and lower\r\neminences of modern Greece have been almost completely denuded of trees,\r\nalong with which have necessarily disappeared the well-springs, and\r\nrunnels, and cascades, and rills, and mountain tarns, which anciently\r\nshed beauty and fertility over the face of Hellas, whose highlands were\r\nonce so densely clad with woods[1642] that the peasants requiring a\r\nshort cut from one valley to another, were compelled to clear themselves\r\na pathway with the axe.[1643] To restore to Greece, therefore, its\r\nwaters, and the beauty and riches depending on them, the mountains must\r\nbe again forested, and severe restraint put on the wantonness of those\r\nvagrant shepherds who constantly expose vast woods to the risk of entire\r\ndestruction for the sake of procuring more delicate grass for their\r\nflocks.[1644]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1641:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1642:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Thus in the\r\n  little island of Stromboli, containing about a thousand inhabitants,\r\n  attempts were made towards the end of the eighteenth century to\r\n  enlarge the cultivable ground by clearing away the woods. Spallanzani,\r\n  Travels in the Two Sicilies, vol. iv. p. 126, seq. The difficulty of\r\n  extirpating trees is illustrated by Theophrastus who relates that, in\r\n  a spot near Pheneon in Arcadia, a well-wooded tract was overflowed by\r\n  the water and the trees destroyed. Next year, when the flood had\r\n  subsided and the mud dried, each kind of tree appeared in the\r\n  situation which it had formerly occupied. The willow, the elm, the\r\n  pine, and the fir, growing in its own place, doubtless from the roots\r\n  of the former trees. Hist. Plant. iii. 1. 2.

The invention of these conveniences of primary\r\nnecessity having preceded the birth of tradition, has, by some writers,\r\nbeen attributed to Danaos, who is supposed to have emigrated from Egypt\r\ninto Greece. Arriving, we are told, at Argos, he, upon the failure of\r\nspontaneous fountains, taught the inhabitants to dig wells, in\r\nconsequence of which he was elected chief. But where was Danaos himself\r\nto have learned this art? He is said to have been an Egyptian, and Egypt\r\nis a country so entirely without springs, that two only exist within its\r\nlimits, and of these but one was known to the ancients. Of wells they\r\nhad none. Danaos could, therefore, if he was an Egyptian, have known\r\nnothing of springs or wells; and, if he had such knowledge, he must have\r\ncome from some other land.[1647]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1645:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Chandler, i. p. 261. The apparatus now used in irrigation by the\r\n  Sciots exactly resembles that of the Egyptian Arabs. Id. i. 315.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1646:\r\n\r\n  Demosth. Adv. Polycl. § 16.

The water was conveyed\r\nthrough wooden pipes[1649] to the cisterns, which appear to have been\r\nfrequently situated in the front court.[1650] Bad water they purified in\r\nseveral ways: by casting into it a little coral powder,[1651] small\r\nlinen bags of bruised barley, or a quantity of laurel leaves, or by\r\npouring it into broad tubs and exposing it for a considerable time to\r\nthe action of the sun and air. When there happened to be about the farms\r\nponds of any magnitude, they introduced into them a number of eels or\r\nriver crabs, which opened the veins of the earth and destroyed leeches.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1648:\r\n\r\n  Λακκοὶ.

For, according to the Peripatetics, πᾶν ὕδωρ προθερμανθὲν\r\n  ψύχεται μᾶλλον, ὥσπερ τὸ τοῖς βασιλεῦσι παρασκευαζόμενον, ὅταν ἑψηθῇ\r\n  μέχρι ζέσεως, περισωρεύουσι τῷ ἀγγείῳ χιόνα πολλὴν, καὶ γίνεται\r\n  ψυχρότερον. Plut. Sympos. vi. 4. 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA scarcely less important branch of the farmer’s studies was that which\r\nrelated to the weather and the general march of the seasons.[1652] Above\r\nall things, it behoved him to observe diligently the rising and setting\r\nof the sun and moon. He was, likewise, carefully to note the state of\r\nthe atmosphere at the disappearance of the Pleiades, since it was\r\nexpected to continue the same until the winter solstice, after which a\r\nchange sometimes immediately supervened, otherwise there was usually no\r\nalteration till the vernal equinox.[1653] Another variation then took\r\nplace in the character of the weather, which afterwards remained fixed\r\ntill the rising of the Pleiades, undergoing successively fresh mutations\r\nat the summer solstice and the autumnal equinox. According to their\r\nobservations, moreover, a rainy winter[1654] was followed by a dry and\r\nraw spring, and the contrary; and a snowy winter by a year of abundance.\r\nBut as nature by no means steadily follows this course, exhibiting many\r\nsudden and abrupt fluctuations, it was found necessary to subject her\r\nrestless phenomena to a more rigid scrutiny, in order that rules might\r\nbe obtained for foretelling the approach of rain, or tempests, or\r\ndroughts, or a continuance of fair weather. Of these some, possibly,\r\nwere founded on imperfect observation or casual coincidences, or a\r\nfanciful linking of causes and effects; while others, we cannot doubt,\r\nsprang from a practical familiarity with the subtler and more shifting\r\nelements of natural philosophy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1652:\r\n\r\n  Geop. i. 2–4. 11. Theophrast. De Signis Pluviarum et de Ventis,\r\n  _passim_. Our own agriculturists, also, were formerly much addicted to\r\n  these studies. Thus, “The oke apples, if broken in sunder about the\r\n  time of their withering, do foreshewe the sequel of the yeare, as the\r\n  expert Kentish husbandmen have observed, by the living things found in\r\n  them: as, if they find an ant, they foretell plentie of graine to\r\n  insue; if a whole worm, like a gentill or maggot, then they\r\n  prognosticate murren of beasts and cattle; if a spider, then (saie\r\n  they) we shall have a pestilence or some such like sickness to followe\r\n  amongst men. These things the learned, also, have observed and noted:\r\n  for Mathiolus, writing upon Dioscorides saith, that before they have\r\n  an hole through them, they conteine in them either a flie, a spider,\r\n  or a worme; if a flie, then warre insueth; if a creeping worme, then\r\n  scarcitie of victuals; if a running spider, then followeth great\r\n  sickness and mortalitie.” Gerrard, Herball, Third Book, c. 29. p.\r\n  1158.

Lord Bacon, Sylva Sylvarum, 675. 812.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs nothing more obviously interests the husbandman than the seasonable\r\narrival and departure of rains, everything connected with them, however\r\nremotely, was observed and treasured up with scrupulous accuracy. Of all\r\nthe circumstances pre-signifying their approach the most certain was\r\nsupposed to be the aspect of the morning; for if, before sunrise, beds\r\nof purpurescent clouds[1655] stretched along the verge of the horizon,\r\nrain was expected that day, or the day after the morrow. The same augury\r\nthey drew, though with less confidence, from the appearance of the\r\nsetting sun,[1656] especially if in winter or spring it went down\r\nthrough an accumulation of clouds or with masses of dusky rack on the\r\nleft. Again, if, on rising, the sun looked pale, dull red, or\r\nspotted;[1657] or, if, previously, its rays were seen streaming\r\nupwards;[1658] or, if, immediately afterwards, a long band of clouds\r\nextended beneath it, intersecting its descending beams; or if the orient\r\nwore a sombre hue; or if piles of sable vapour towered into the welkin;\r\nor if the clouds were scattered loosely over the sky like fleeces of\r\nwool;[1659] or came waving up from the south in long sinuous streaks—the\r\n“mares’ tails” of our nautical vocabulary—the husbandman reckoned with\r\ncertainty upon rain, floods, and tempestuous winds. Among the signs of\r\nshowers peculiar to the site of Athens may be reckoned these following:\r\nif a rampart of white ground-fogs begirt at night the basis of Hymettos;\r\nor, if its summits were capped with vapour;[1660] or, if troops of mists\r\nsettled in the hollow of the smaller mount, called the Springless; or,\r\nif a single cloud rested on the fane of Zeus at Ægina.[1661] The violent\r\nroaring of the sea upon the beach was the forerunner of a gale, and they\r\nwere enabled to conjecture from what quarter it was to blow, by the\r\nmovements of the waters, which retreated from the shore before a north\r\nwind; while, at the approach of the sirocco, they were piled up higher\r\nthan usual against the cliffs. Elsewhere, in Attica, they supposed wet\r\nweather to be foretold by the summits of Eubœa rising clear, sharp, and\r\nunusually elevated through a dense floor of exhalations, which, when\r\nthey mounted and gathered in blowing weather about the peaks of\r\nCaphareus,[1662] on the eastern shores of the island, presaged an\r\nimpending storm of five days’ continuance. But here these signs\r\nconcerned rather the mariner than the husbandman, since the cliffs that\r\nstretched along this coast are rugged and precipitous, and the\r\napproaches so dangerous that few vessels which are driven on it escape.\r\nScarcely are the crews able to save themselves, unless their bark happen\r\nto be extremely light. Another portent of foul weather was the\r\napparition of a circle about the moon, while, by the double reflection\r\nof its orb north and south, that luminary appeared to be multiplied into\r\nthree. At night, also, if the nubecula,[1663] called the Manger, in the\r\nconstellation of the Crab, shone less luminously, it betokened a similar\r\nstate of the atmosphere. A like inference[1664] was drawn when the moon\r\nat three days old rose dusky; or, with blunt horns; or, with its rim, or\r\nwhole disk, red; or blotted with black spots; or encircled by two\r\nhalos.[1665]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1655:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Problem. xxvi. 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1656:\r\n\r\n  The sun-sets of the Mediterranean exhibit, as most travellers will\r\n  have observed, a variety of gorgeous phenomena, which, as betokening\r\n  certain states of the atmosphere serve as so many admonitions to the\r\n  husbandman. The sun before going down “assumed,” observes Dr.\r\n  Chandler, “a variety of fantastic shapes. It was surrounded, first,\r\n  with a golden glory of great extent, and flamed upon the surface of\r\n  the sea in a long column of fire. The lower half of the orb soon after\r\n  emerged in the horizon, the other portion remaining very large and\r\n  red, with half of a smaller orb beneath it, and separate, but in the\r\n  same direction, the circular rim approaching the line of its diameter.\r\n  These two, by degrees, united, and then changed rapidly into different\r\n  figures, until the resemblance was that of a capacious punch-bowl\r\n  inverted. The rim of the bottom extending upward, and the body\r\n  lengthening below it, became a mushroom on a stalk with a round head.\r\n  It was next metamorphosed into a flaming caldron, of which the lid,\r\n  rising up, swelled nearly into an orb and vanished. The other portion\r\n  put on several uncircular forms, and, after many twinklings and faint\r\n  glimmerings, slowly disappeared, quite red, leaving the clouds hanging\r\n  over the dark rocks on the Barbary shore finely tinged with a vivid\r\n  bloody hue.” Travels, i. p. 4. Appearances similar, though of inferior\r\n  brilliance and variety, are sometimes witnessed in the Western\r\n  Hemisphere. Describing the beauties of an evening on the Canadian\r\n  shore, Sir R. H. Bonnycastle observes: “First, there was a double sun\r\n  by reflection, each disk equally distinct; afterwards, when the orb\r\n  reached the mark x, a solid body of light, equal in breadth with the\r\n  sun itself, but of great length from the shore, shot down on the sea,\r\n  and remained like a broad fiery golden column, or bar, until the black\r\n  high land hid the luminary itself.” The Canadas in 1841. v. i. p. 34.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1657:\r\n\r\n              Ille ubi nascentem maculis variaverit ortum\r\n              Conditus in nubem, medioque refugerit orbe;\r\n              Suspecti tibi sint imbres.\r\n                                   Virg.

And, therefore, the observing of the\r\n  smaller stars is a sign of tempests following.” Sylva Sylvarum, 812.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1664:\r\n\r\n  Similar observations have been made in most countries, as we find from\r\n  the signs of the weather collected by Erra Pater, and translated by\r\n  Lilly, Part iv. § 3–5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1665:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

The cause is, for that this happeneth\r\n  but in certain matters which have in themselves some sweetness, which\r\n  the gentle dew of the rainbow doth draw forth, and the like to soft\r\n  showers, for they also make the ground sweet, but none are so delicate\r\n  as the dew of the rainbow where it falleth.” Sylva Sylvarum. 832. His\r\n  Lordship here, as in many other places, adopts the explanation of the\r\n  Peripatetics while he seems to be himself assigning the cause of the\r\n  phenomenon. Aristotle (Problem. 12. 3) enters fully into the subject,\r\n  which appears to have been brought under the notice of philosophers by\r\n  the shepherds who had observed that when certain thickets had been\r\n  laid in ashes the passing of a rainbow over the spot caused a sweet\r\n  odour to exhale from it. The same fact is noticed by Theophrastus, De\r\n  Caus. Plant. 6. 17. 7. Cf. Plin. Hist. Nat. 12. 52. 21. 18. 2. 60. To\r\n  many among the older philosophers that comparatively rare phenomenon,\r\n  the lunar rainbow, was unknown. (Arist. Meteor. iii. 2: νύκτωρ δ᾽ ἀπὸ\r\n  σελήνης ὡς μὲν οἱ ἀρχαῖοι ᾢοντο οὐκ ἐγίγνετο·) but in the time of\r\n  Aristotle it had been observed, and the cause of its pearly whiteness\r\n  investigated. Cf. Meteorol. iii. 4. 5. Senec. Quæst. Nat. i. 2, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOther signs of mutation in the atmosphere they discovered in almost\r\nevery part of nature; for example, when bubbles rose on the surface of a\r\nriver they looked for a fall of rain; as also when small land-birds were\r\nseen drenching their plumage; when the crow was beheld washing his head\r\nupon the rocky beach,[1668] or the raven flapping his wings, while with\r\nhis voice he imitated amidst his croaking the pattering of drops of\r\nrain; when the peasant was awakened in the morning by the cry of the\r\npassing crane,[1669] or the shrill note of the chaffinch within his\r\ndwelling. Flights of island birds flocking to the continent,[1670]\r\npreceded drought; as a number of jackdaws and ravens flying up and down,\r\nand imitating the scream of the hawk, did rain. The incessant shrieks of\r\nthe screech-owl and the vehement cawing of the crow, heard during a\r\nserene night, foretold the approach of storms. The barn-door fowl and\r\nthe house-dog also played the part of soothsayers, teaching their master\r\nto dread impending storms by rolling themselves in the dust. Of similar\r\nimport was the flocking of geese with noise to their food, or the\r\nskimming of swallows along the surface of the water.[1671] Again, when\r\ntroops of dolphins were seen rolling near the shore, or oxen licking\r\ntheir fore-hoofs, or looking southwards, or, with a suspicious air,\r\nsnuffing the elements,[1672] or going bellowing to their stalls; when\r\nwolves approached the homesteads; when flies bit sharp,[1673] or frogs\r\ncroaked vociferously, or the ruddock, or land-toad, crept into the\r\nwater; when the salamander lizard appeared, and the note of the\r\ngreen-frog was heard in the trees, the rustic donned his capote, and\r\nprepared, like Anaxagoras at Olympia,[1674] for a shower. The flight of\r\nthe storm-birds, kepphoi,[1675] was supposed to indicate a tempest from\r\nthe point of the heavens towards which they flew. When in bright and\r\nwindless weather clouds of cobwebs,[1676] floated through the air, the\r\nhusbandman anticipated a drenching for his fields, as also when earthen\r\npots and brass pans emitted sparks; when lamps spat; when the wick made\r\nmushrooms;[1677] when a halo encircled its flame,[1678] or when the\r\nflame itself was dusky. The housewife was forewarned of coming\r\nhail-storms, generally from the north, by a profusion of bright sparks\r\nappearing on the surface of her charcoal fire; when her feet swelled she\r\nknew that the wind would blow from the south.[1679] Heaps of clouds like\r\nburnished copper rising after rain in the west portended fine weather;\r\nas did likewise the tops of lofty mountains, as Athos, Ossa, and\r\nOlympos, appearing sharply defined against the sky; while an apparent\r\naugmentation in the height of promontories and the number of islands\r\nforeshowed wind.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1668:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

For the\r\npurpose of procuring at a cheap rate whatever was wanted for the use of\r\nthe establishment,[1680] smiths, carpenters, and potters, were kept upon\r\nthe land or in its immediate neighbourhood; by which means also the\r\nnecessity was avoided of often sending the farm-servants to the\r\nneighbouring town, where it was observed they contracted bad habits, and\r\nwere rendered more vicious and slothful.[1681] Waggons, therefore, and\r\ncarts, and ploughs, and harrows, were constructed on the spot, though it\r\nwas sometimes necessary perhaps to obtain from a distance the timber\r\nused for these implements, which was generally cut in winter-time. They\r\nexhibited much nicety in their choice of wood. Thus they would have the\r\npoplar or mulberry-tree for the felloes of their wheels; the ash, the\r\nilex, and the oxya, for the axle-tree, and fine close-grained maple for\r\nthe yokes of their oxen,[1682] sometimes carved in the form of serpents\r\nwhich seemed to wind round the necks of the animals, and project their\r\nheads on either side.[1683] Their harrows, it is probable, were formed\r\nlike our own. The construction of the plough,[1684] always continued to\r\nbe extremely simple. In the age of Hesiod[1685] it consisted of four\r\nparts, the handle, the socket, the coulter, and the beam; and very\r\nlittle alteration seems afterwards to have been made in its form or\r\nstructure, till the introduction of the wheel-plough, which did not, it\r\nis believed, occur until after the age of Virgil. The more primitive\r\ninstrument, however, would seem to have consisted originally of two\r\nparts only, one serving the purpose of handle, socket, and share, the\r\nother being the beam by which it was fastened to the yoke. In the\r\nantique implement[1686] the beam was sometimes made of laurel or elm,\r\nthe socket of oak, and the handle of ilex.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1680:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 49.

To give the\r\npestle greater effect it was fixed above in a cross-bar, seven feet\r\nlong, and worked by two individuals.[1687] By this rude contrivance, it\r\nis possible to produce flour as fine as that proceeding from the most\r\nperfect boulting machine. In addition to these they possessed winnowing\r\nfans, scythes, sickles, pruning-hooks, fern or braken-scythes, saws and\r\nhand-saws, used in pruning and grafting, spades, shovels, rakes,\r\npick-axes, hoes, mattocks,—one, two, and three pronged,—dibbles,\r\nfork-dibbles, and grubbing-axes.[1688] When rustics were clearing away\r\nunderwood or cutting down brakes, they went clad in hooded skin-cloaks,\r\nleather gaiters, and long gloves.[1689]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1687:\r\n\r\n  Idem, 423, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1688:\r\n\r\n  Poll. x. 129.

In lean lands which required most the help of art,\r\nthey were still careful to avoid excess in the employment of manure,\r\nspreading it frequently rather than copiously; for as, left to\r\nthemselves, they would have been too cold, so, when over enriched by\r\nart, their prolific virtue was thought to be consumed by heat. In\r\napplying it to plants, they were careful to interpose a layer of earth\r\nlest their roots should be scorched. Of all kinds of manure they\r\nconsidered that of birds the best,[1691] except the aquatic species,\r\nwhich, when mixed, however, was not rejected. Most husbandmen set a\r\npeculiar value on the sweepings of dovecotes,[1692] which, in small\r\nquantities, were frequently scattered over the fields with the seed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1690:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 21, seq.

From a speech of the Earl of Radnor, in the House of\r\n  Lords, May 25, 1841, we learn that our own farmers have begun to make\r\n  experiments with this kind of manure on the lands of Great Britain,\r\n  and that ship-loads of bird’s dung have been imported for the purpose\r\n  from the Pacific. The rocks and smaller islands along the American\r\n  coast are sometimes white with this substance.

When they had lain long\r\nenough to be entirely decayed, they were fit for use. To the above were\r\nsometimes added wood-ashes, the refuse of leather-dressers, the\r\ncleansing of stables, and cow-houses, with stubble, brambles, and thorns\r\nreduced to ashes. In maritime situations sea-weed,[1694] also, having\r\nbeen well washed in fresh water, was mingled in large proportion with\r\nother materials, and, where possible, a channel was made conducting the\r\nmuck and puddle[1695] of the neighbouring road into the pit, which at\r\nonce accelerated the putrescence of the manure and augmented it. The\r\nAttic husbandmen had a mode of enriching their lands[1696] somewhat\r\nexpensive, and, as far as I know, peculiar to themselves; having sown a\r\nfield, they allowed the corn to spring up and the blade to reach a\r\nconsiderable height, upon which they again ploughed it in as a kind of\r\nsacrifice to the earth. A practice, not altogether unlike, still\r\nprevails in the kingdom of Naples, where the husbandmen sometimes bury\r\ntheir beans and lupins, just before flowering, for manure.[1697]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1693:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph.

Plant. viii.\r\n  7. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1697:\r\n\r\n  Swinburne, Letters from the Courts of Europe, i. 144.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn ploughing there was great variety of practice, and in small farms,\r\nwhere the soil was light, they had recourse to what may be denominated\r\nspade husbandry. Most lands were ploughed thrice; first, immediately\r\nafter the removal of the preceding crop; secondly, at a convenient\r\ninterval of time; and, thirdly,[1698] in the sowing season, when the\r\nploughman scattered the grain in the furrows as they were laid open\r\nwhile a lad followed at his heels with a hoe breaking the clods and\r\ncovering the seed that it might not be devoured by the birds.[1699]\r\nOccasionally, in very hot weather, and in certain situations, the farmer\r\nploughed all night;[1700] first, out of consideration to the oxen, whose\r\nhealth would have suffered from the sun; secondly, to preserve the\r\nmoisture and richness of the soil; and, thirdly, by the aid of the dew,\r\nto render it more pliable. On these occasions, it was customary to\r\nemploy two pair of oxen and a heavier share in order to produce the\r\ndeeper furrows, and turn up the hidden fat of the earth. In choosing a\r\nploughman they took care that he should be tall and powerful,[1701] that\r\nhe might be able to thrust the share deeper into the ground and wield it\r\ngenerally with facility: and yet they would not, if possible, that he\r\nshould be under forty years of age, lest, instead of attending to his\r\nduties, his eye should be glancing hither and thither, and his mind be\r\nroving after his companions.[1702] When in particular haste to complete\r\nhis task, the ploughman often carried a long loaf under his arm, which,\r\nlike the French peasants, he ate as he went along.[1703] In this\r\ndepartment of rural labour it may be observed, mules were sometimes\r\nemployed as well as oxen.[1704] Both were directed and kept in order by\r\na sharp goad.[1705]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1698:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Plant. vi. 4. 8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe rules observed in sowing were numerous, and, in many instances, not\r\na little curious. As a matter of course, they were careful to adapt the\r\ngrain to the soil:[1710] thus rich plains were appropriated to wheat,\r\nand in the intervals cropped with vegetables; middling grounds to\r\nbarley;[1711] while poor and hungry spots were given up to lentils,\r\nvetches, lupins, and such other pulse as were cultivated on a large\r\nscale. Beans and peas, however, were supposed to thrive best in fat and\r\nlevel lands. The principal sowing-time[1712] was in autumn; for, as soon\r\nas the equinoctial rains had moistened the earth, the sower immediately\r\nwent forth to sow, committing to the ground the hopes of the future\r\nyear. The best time for scattering wheat they placed somewhere in\r\nNovember, about the setting of the constellation called the Crown. They\r\nwere careful in this operation to avoid the time when the south\r\nwind[1713] blew, and, generally, all cold and raw weather, as it\r\nrendered the earth ungenial, and little apt to fructify that which was\r\nentrusted to it. Great skill was supposed to be required in scattering\r\nthe seed: in the first place, that it should be equally distributed;\r\nand, secondly, that none should fall between the horns of the oxen,\r\nsuperstition having taught them the belief that such grain, which they\r\ndenominated Kerasbolos,[1714] if it sprang up at all, would produce corn\r\nwhich could neither be baked nor eaten. A favourite sowing sieve was\r\nmade of wolf’s-hide, pierced with thirty holes as large as the tips of\r\nthe fingers. In later ages much virtue was supposed to reside in the\r\nbarbarous term Phriel,[1715] which they accordingly wrote on the plough.\r\nThe choice of grains for sowing necessarily afforded much exercise[1716]\r\nto their ingenuity: seed wheat, they thought, should be of a rich gold\r\ncolour, full, smooth, and solid; barley, white and heavy; both not\r\nexceeding one year old, for they quickly deteriorated, and, after the\r\nthird year, would not they supposed grow. This, however, was an error,\r\nsince barley has been known to preserve its vitality upwards of two\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1710:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1711:\r\n\r\n  A fine kind of barley was cultivated on the plain of Marathon, which\r\n  obtained the name of Achillean, on account, as Dr. Chandler\r\n  conjectures, of its tallness. ii. 184.

If the produce of any of\r\nthese samples withered, through the influence they supposed of Syrius,\r\nthe wheat which it represented was rejected. As corn when committed to\r\nthe earth is exposed to numerous enemies, they had recourse to a variety\r\nof contrivances for its preservation: to protect it from birds, mice,\r\nand ants,[1719] they steeped it in the juice of houseleeks, or mixed it\r\nwith hellebore and cypress leaves, and scattered it out of a circle, or\r\nsprinkled it with water into which river crabs had been thrown for eight\r\ndays, or with powdered hartshorn or ivory. Not satisfied with these\r\nprecautions, they had likewise recourse to scarecrows,[1720] fixing up\r\nlong reeds here and there in the fields, with dead birds suspended to\r\nthem by the feet. This long list of contrivances they closed by a spell:\r\ntaking a live toad, they carried it round the field by night, after\r\nwhich they shut it up carefully in a jar, which they buried in the\r\nmiddle of the grounds.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1717:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 17.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1718:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 15.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1719:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 18. “The bunting, the yellow-hammer, and a species of\r\n  Emberiza, nearly related to it, frequent the low bushes in the\r\n  neighbourhood of corn-fields.” Sibth. in Walp.

But the most effectual of\r\nall spells, was for a young woman, naked and with dishevelled hair, to\r\ntake a live cock in her hands and bear him round the fields, upon which,\r\nnot only would the choke-weed and the restharrow vanish,[1722] but all\r\nthe produce of the land would turn out of a superior quality.[1723]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1721:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 24.

In the first place, all\r\nstones, stumps, bushes, and brambles,[1724] were diligently removed,\r\ntogether with whatever else might interrupt the free play of the scythe\r\nin mowing. They avoided, moreover, letting into them their droves of\r\nhogs, which were found to turn up the soil and destroy the roots of the\r\nyoung grass. In moist lands, too, even the larger cattle were excluded,\r\nas the holes made by their hoofs[1725] in sinking broke up the fine\r\nlevel of the turf. Old hay fields, in districts where much rain fell,\r\ngrew in time to be clothed with a coating of moss,[1726] which some\r\nfarmers sought to remove by manuring the ground with ashes; but the more\r\nscientific agriculturists ploughed them up, and took precisely the same\r\nsteps as in the formation of a new meadow, that is, they sowed the\r\nground with beans, turnips, or rape-seed, which, in the second year,\r\nwere succeeded by wheat; on the third it was thoroughly cleared out, and\r\nsown with hay-seed, mingled with vetches, after which the whole field\r\nwas finely levelled by the harrow.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1724:\r\n\r\n  Colum. ii. 18.

They then, in\r\nconsequence of the hot weather, proceeded half-naked[1737] to the\r\nfields, where, taking the sickle in hand, and separating into two\r\ndivisions, they stationed themselves at either end of the piece of corn\r\nto be reaped, and began their work with vigour and emulation, each party\r\nstriving to reach the centre of the field before their rivals.[1738] On\r\nother occasions they took advantage of the wind,[1739] moving along with\r\nit, whereby they were supposed to benefit considerably, avoiding the\r\nbeard or chaff which it might have blown into their eyes, and having by\r\nits action the tall straw bent to their hand.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1735:\r\n\r\n  The harvest began earlier in Salamis than in the neighbourhood of\r\n  Athens.

Xenoph. Œconom. xviii. 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn many parts of Greece, though the practice was not general, the women\r\njoined in these labours. The reapers, as they advanced, laid the corn\r\nbehind them in long lines upon the stubble, and were followed by two\r\nother classes of harvesters, one of whom bound it into sheaves which the\r\nothers bore back and piled up into mows. Of the whole of these\r\noperations, together with the plenteous feast which interrupted or\r\nterminated their toils, Homer has left us a graphic picture in the\r\nIliad:[1740]\r\n\r\n  There in a field ’mid lofty corn, the lusty reapers stand,\r\n  Plying their task right joyously, with sickle each in hand.\r\n  Some strew in lines, as on they press, the handfuls thick behind,\r\n  While at their heels the heavy sheaves their merry comrades bind.\r\n  These to the mows a troop of boys next bear in haste away,\r\n  Piling upon the golden glebe the triumphs of the day.\r\n  Among them wrapped in silent joy, their sceptered king appears,\r\n  Beholding, in the swelling heaps, the stores of future years.\r\n  A mighty ox beneath an oak the busy heralds slay,\r\n  With grateful sacrifice to close the labours of the day.\r\n  While near, the husbandman’s repast the rustic maids prepare,\r\n  Sprinkling with flour the broiling cates whose savour fills the air.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1740:\r\n\r\n  σ. 550, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn these remote and unsettled times it behoved the rustic to keep a\r\nsharp look-out on the sheaves left behind him on the field, as there\r\nwere usually prowlers,[1741] lurking amid the neighbouring woods and\r\nthickets, ready to pounce upon and carry off whatever they saw\r\nunguarded.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1741:\r\n\r\n  Ἡμερόκοιτοὶ ἀνδρες, an elegant euphonism for “thieves”. Hesiod. Opp.\r\n  et Dies, 605. Cf. the note of Gœttling on verse 375.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe implement used in cutting wheat seems always to have been the\r\nsickle, while in the case of barley and other inferior grains, the\r\nscythe was commonly employed. In some parts of ancient Gaul, where no\r\nvalue was set upon the straw, corn was reaped by a sort of cart,[1742]\r\narmed in front with scythes, having the edges inclined upwards, which,\r\nas it was driven along by an ox, harnessed behind, cut off the ears of\r\ncorn, which were received into the tumbril. In this manner the produce\r\nof a whole field might be got in easily in a day. Reaping among the\r\nancient inhabitants of Italy[1743] was performed in three ways: first\r\nthey reaped close, as in Umbria, and laid the handfuls carefully on the\r\nground, after which the ears were separated from the straw, and borne in\r\nbaskets to the threshing-floor. Elsewhere, as in Picenum, they made use\r\nof a ripple or serrated hook, having a long handle with which the ears\r\nonly were cut off, leaving the straw standing to be afterwards collected\r\nand raked up into mows.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1742:\r\n\r\n  Pallad. vii. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1743:\r\n\r\n  Varro. i. 50.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Rome they reaped with the common sickle, holding\r\nthe upper part of the straw in their left hand, and cutting it off in\r\nthe middle. This tall stubble was afterwards mown and carried off to be\r\nused as fodder or bedding for cattle. In Upper Egypt and Nubia, the\r\ndhoura stalks are left about two feet in height to support the crop of\r\nkidney-beans which succeeds next in order. Among the Athenians[1744]\r\nwhen the corn grew tall the stubble was suffered to remain to be burned\r\nfor manure; but, when short, the value of the straw led them to reap\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1744:\r\n\r\n  Καὶ ἀκροτομοίης δ᾽ἂν, ἔφη, ἢ παρὰ γῆν τέμνοις; ἢν μὲν βραχὺς ἦ ὁ\r\n  κάλαμος τοῦ σίτου, ἔγωγ’, ἔφην, κάτωθεν ἂν τέμνοιμι, ἵνα ἱκανὰ τὰ\r\n  ἄχυρα μᾶλλον γίγνηται. Ἐὰν δὲ ὑψηλὸς ᾖ, νομίζω ὀρθῶς ἂν ποιεῖν\r\n  μεσοτομῶν, ἵνα μήτε οἱ ἁλοῶντες μοχθῶσι περιττὸν πόνον, μήτε οἱ\r\n  λικμῶντες, ὧν οὐδὲν προσδέονται. Τὸ δὲ ἐv τῇ γῇ λειφθὲν ἡγοῦμαι καὶ\r\n  κατακαυθὲν συνωφελεῖν ἂν τὴν γῆν καὶ εις κοπρον ἐμβληθὲν τὴν κόπρον\r\n  συμπληθύνειν. Xenoph. Œconom. xviii. 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn separating the grain from the straw the ancients made use of horses,\r\noxen, and mules, which, passing round and round over the\r\nthreshing-floor, trod out the corn. All the labourer had to do was to\r\nguide the movements of the cattle, and take care that no part of the\r\nsheaf remained untrodden.[1745] From a very humane law in the Old\r\nTestament we learn, that among some nations it was customary to tie up\r\nthe mouths of such animals as they employed in this labour, which was\r\nforbidden the Israelites: “Thou shalt not,” says the Scripture, “muzzle\r\nthe ox that treadeth out the corn.” Nor was it practised among the\r\nGreeks in the age of Homer,[1746] whom we find describing the oxen\r\nbellowing as they made their unwearied round. The threshing-floor, which\r\nwas of a circular form,[1747] stood on a breezy eminence, in the open\r\nfield, where, as at present, in modern Greece, and in the Crimea,[1748]\r\na high pole was set up in the centre, to which the cattle were tied by a\r\ncord determining the extent of the circle they had to describe.[1749]\r\nThe end being nailed, every turn made by the cattle coiled the rope\r\nabout the pole and diminished their range, until, at length, they were\r\nbrought quite close to the centre, after which, their heads were turned\r\nabout, and by moving in an opposite direction the cord was unwound.\r\nGreat pains were taken in the construction of this threshing-floor,\r\nwhich was somewhat elevated about the centre, in order, as Varro\r\nobserves, that what rain fell might speedily run off. It was sometimes\r\npaved with stone, or pitched with flints, but more commonly coated with\r\nstucco, made level by a roller, and well soaked with the lees of oil\r\nwhich at once prevented the growth of weeds and grass, preserved it from\r\ncracking, and repelled the approach of mice, ants, and moles, to which\r\noil-lees are destructive.[1750] Though some authorities advise that it\r\nshould be situated under the master’s, or at least the steward’s, eye,\r\nit was generally thought advisable to keep it at a distance from the\r\nhouse and gardens, since the finer particles of chaff, borne thickly\r\nthrough the air, caused ophthalmia, and often blindness,[1751] and\r\nproved exceedingly injurious to all plants and pulpy fruits, more\r\nparticularly grapes. In some parts of the ancient world, exposed to the\r\nchances of summer rains, the threshing-floor was covered; and, even in\r\nItaly, an umbracula,[1752] or shed, was always constructed close at\r\nhand, into which the corn could be removed in case of bad weather. But\r\nthis in the sunnier climate of Greece was judged unnecessary. In\r\nobedience to a notion prevalent among Hellenic farmers, the sheaves were\r\npiled up with the straw towards the south, by which means they believed\r\nthe grain was enlarged and loosened from the hose. When the farmer\r\nhappened to be scant of cattle he made use of a threshing-machine,[1753]\r\nwhich consisted of a kind of heavy sledge, toothed below with sharp\r\nstones or iron. Occasionally, too, the flail[1754] was used, especially\r\nin the case of such corn as was laid up in the barn and threshed during\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1745:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph. Œconom. xviii. 4. The same custom still prevails in Southern\r\n  Europe and in the East. “Corn is trodden out in Granada in\r\n  circular-formed threshing-floors, in the open fields; the animals\r\n  employed are mules or oxen.” Napier, Excursions, &c., i. 156. Again,\r\n  in the Troad, “The oxen or horses being harnessed to a sort of sledge,\r\n  the bottom part of which is armed with sharp flints, are driven over\r\n  the corn, the person who guides the cattle balancing him or herself\r\n  with great dexterity whilst rapidly drawn round in revolving circles.”\r\n  Id. ii. 171.

In serene days they had recourse to a winnowing machine,\r\nwhich, though turned by the hand, was of great power, as we may judge\r\nfrom its being employed in cleansing vetches, and even beans.[1756] To\r\nreceive the chaff, which was too valuable to be lost, pits appear to\r\nhave been sunk all round the threshing-floor, which, for the passage of\r\nthe men and cattle, would appear to have been covered, save in the\r\ndirection of the wind.[1757] When the corn was designed for immediate\r\nuse, one winnowing was deemed sufficient; but that which was intended to\r\nbe laid up in the granary[1758] underwent the operation a second time.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1755:\r\n\r\n  Plat.

Every means which could communicate to grain firmness and\r\ndurability appears to have been tried by them; and their success was\r\nanswerable to their diligence, for, in their granaries, wheat was\r\npreserved in perfection fifty, and millet a hundred years.[1760] Their\r\nmethods, however, were various; some laid up their grain in hollow rocks\r\nand caves, as in Thrace and Cappadocia; others sank deep pits in the\r\nearth[1761] where they found it to be perfectly free from humidity, as\r\nin Farther Spain, while others, as in Hither Spain, Apulia, and\r\nGreece,[1762] erected their granaries on lofty basements fronting the\r\nEast, and with openings towards the north and west winds.[1763] There\r\nwas usually a range of numerous diminutive windows near the roof, to\r\nsupply free vent for the heated air, while the floor, in many cases,\r\ncontained small apertures for the admission of the cool breezes beneath.\r\nThe walls were built with suitable solidity, and having, together with\r\nthe floor, been plastered with rough mortar,[1764] made commonly with\r\nhair, for which chaff was sometimes substituted, received a coat of fine\r\nstucco, on the preparation of which much care was bestowed. It was\r\ngenerally composed of lime, sand, and powdered marble, moistened with\r\nthe lees of oil, the peculiar flavour and odour of which were supposed\r\neffectually to repel the approaches of mice,[1765] weevils, and ants.\r\nInstead of this a common stucco, formed of clay, was often used.\r\nOccasionally the grain was packed up in baskets or large jars,[1766]\r\nsuch, it may be presumed, as those still employed for the purpose in\r\nAfrica, where they are commonly kept in a corner outside the door. Beans\r\nand other pulse were preserved in oil-jars rubbed with ashes.[1767]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1759:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Pallad. l. 19. Colum. i. 6.

Various other\r\nprecautions were, likewise, taken to protect the sacred gifts of Demeter\r\nfrom depredation, such as drawing on the floor broad lines of\r\nchalk,[1768] or strewing handfuls of wild origany round the heaps, or\r\nsprinkling them with the ashes of oaken twigs or dry cow’s dung, or\r\nsprigs of wormwood and southernwood, or, in greater quantity, the leaves\r\nof the everlasting. Instead of these, in some cases, they made use of\r\npowdered clay[1769] or dry pomegranate leaves, rubbed small, and passed\r\nthrough a sieve, a chœnix of which was sprinkled over a bushel of corn.\r\nThe favourite plan, however, seems to have been, to spread a layer of\r\nhalf-withered fleabane over the floor, on which were poured about ten\r\nbushels of wheat, then a layer of fleabane, and so on, until the granary\r\nwas full.[1770] Wheat thus layed up was supposed not only to last many\r\nyears, but also to preserve its weight in breadmaking. To render barley\r\ndurable, they strewed over it laurel leaves, or the ashes of laurel\r\nwood, as, likewise, everlasting, calaminth, and gypsum, or placed a\r\ntightly-corked bottle of vinegar,[1771] in the middle of the heap. To\r\ncommunicate greater plumpness to all kinds of grain, they sprinkled over\r\nthe piles a mixture composed of nitre,[1772] spume of nitre, and fine\r\nearth, which, likewise, acted as a preservative. To render flour more\r\ndurable, they thrust into it small maple branches, stripped of their\r\nleaves, or little cakes of salt and cumin.[1773]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1768:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 29.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1769:\r\n\r\n  This substance was brought from Olynthos and Cerinthos, in Eubœa. It\r\n  is said to have improved the appearance of the wheat, though it\r\n  deteriorated its quality as an article of food. Theoph. viii. 10. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1770:\r\n\r\n  The granaries of the island of Syra, with the contrivance by which\r\n  corn is there preserved at the present day, are thus described by\r\n  Della Rocca:—“Les granges, appelées en Grec θεμονέα, ont communément\r\n  une vingtaine de pieds de long, sur huit à dix de hauteur et de\r\n  largeur. On les remplit jusqu’à la moitié de leur hauteur, de paille\r\n  bien foulée: on pratique un espace de trois ou quatre pieds, que l’on\r\n  remplit de grain. A côté on en forme un autre, que l’on remplit de\r\n  même, et ainsi de suite, selon l’étendue de la grange, et la quantité\r\n  de grain que l’on a; cela fait, par des ouvertures pratiquées dans la\r\n  couverture, on recouvre de paille tout le bled, jusqu’à ce que la\r\n  grange soit exactement remplie. Quand on veut en faire usage, on\r\n  commence par le tas le plus voisin de la porte; on enlève d’abord la\r\n  paille avec beaucoup de précaution: plus on approche, plus cette\r\n  précaution augmente; enfin, pour ôter les derniers brins de paille, on\r\n  se sert d’un balai de millepertuis ou d’autres plantes que l’on fait\r\n  sécher; et si malgré tous ces soins, la surface du monceau de grain\r\n  n’est pas bien nette, on achève d’en enlever toutes les menues pailles\r\n  en la vannant avec un chapeau car les paysans de nos îles portent\r\n  comme ici, dans les champs, des chapeaux ronds de feutre; ils en\r\n  portent aussi de paille, que l’on travaille avec beaucoup de\r\n  délicatesse à Sifanto.” Traité Complet sur les Abeilles. t. i. p. 199,\r\n  seq. Among the tribes of Northern Africa a more complete system of\r\n  preserving grain prevails. “The Arabs, in lieu of granaries, preserve\r\n  all their grain in pits: forty or fifty of these are made, each to\r\n  contain about a thousand bushels: the spot selected is a dry, sandy\r\n  soil, the hole being formed in the shape of a large earthen jug, the\r\n  sides are plastered with mortar about a foot in thickness, and the\r\n  wheat or grain filled up to the mouth, which is left just large enough\r\n  for a man to get in at, and is about three feet below the surface of\r\n  the ground; this is now plastered over also, and filled with the soil\r\n  around to the same level as the surrounding country. The earth taken\r\n  out in forming the pits is removed to a distance, and being scattered\r\n  abroad, in a month or two the grass grows over the surface, and no\r\n  one, unless those who have buried this treasure, would imagine that\r\n  there was anything beneath their feet. The grain thus buried preserves\r\n  for many years. I have eaten bread at the Esmailla made from wheat as\r\n  old as the Sultan, having been buried the year of his birth, and it\r\n  was as good as that made of flour from this year’s crop.” Colonel\r\n  Scott, Journal of a Residence in the Esmailla of Abd-el-Kader. p. 155,\r\n  seq. Mandelslo (lib. ii. c. iii.) found corn-vaults of similar\r\n  construction in the Azores; and most travellers who have visited the\r\n  island of Malta will have observed in the fortifications of Valetta\r\n  that series of curious and beautiful granaries excavated in the form\r\n  of a bottle in the solid rock.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1771:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 30, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1772:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 28.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1773:\r\n\r\n  Geop. ii. 30.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the earth having been thus safely lodged within doors, the\r\ngrateful husbandmen celebrated in honour of their rural gods, Demeter\r\nand Dionysos, a festival which may, perhaps, be denominated that of the\r\nHarvest Home. In Attica it took place in the great temple at Eleusis,\r\nand continued during several days. No bloody sacrifices were on this\r\noccasion offered up; but, in lieu of them, oblations of cakes and fruit\r\nwith other rustic offerings, designed at once to express their gratitude\r\nfor past blessings, and to render the gods propitious to them in future.\r\nThe first loaf made from the new corn was probably eaten or offered up\r\non this day, since it received the name of Thargelos, or Thalusios, from\r\nThalusia, the denomination of the festival.[1774]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1774:\r\n\r\n  Vid.

There were\r\nothers to whom the care of the fruit was entrusted; and both these\r\nclasses of persons were probably elderly men, remarkable for their\r\ndiligence and fidelity, who were rewarded, by appointment to this more\r\neasy duty, for their honest discharge in youth of such as were more\r\npainful and laborious. Boys were sometimes set to keep watch over\r\nvineyards,[1776] as we may see in the first Eidyll of Theocritus, where\r\nhe gives us a lively sketch of such a guardian plotted against by two\r\nfoxes.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1775:\r\n\r\n  Such of these as had charge of the timber may be denominated\r\n  wood-reeves, a term which answers very well the Latin Saltuarius. The\r\n  slave-guards of forests, in Crete, were called Ergatones. Hesych. ap.\r\n  Meurs. Cret. p. 190.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1776:\r\n\r\n  Casaub. ad Theoph. Char. p. 223, seq. Theocrit. Eidyll. xxv. 27. Cf.\r\n  Feith. Antiq. Hom. iv. i. 276, sqq. Vineyards in Athens still require\r\n  guards. Speaking of his approach to Athens from the Peiræeus, Chandler\r\n  observes:—“In a tree was a kind of couch, sheltered with boughs,\r\n  belonging to a man employed to watch there during the vintage.” ii.\r\n  27.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                             PASTORAL LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut within the circle of Hellenic country life[1777] there was a kind of\r\nparenthetical existence, a remnant of the old nomadic habits, once\r\ncommon, perhaps, to the whole race,—I mean the pastoral life, of which\r\nwe obtain so many glimpses through the leafy glades and grassy avenues\r\nof Greek poetry. No doubt, the fancy of imaginative men, thirsting for a\r\ndegree of simplicity and happiness greater than they find around them in\r\ncities or villages, is apt to kindle and shed too glorious a light on\r\napproaching the tranquil solitudes, the pine forests, the mountain\r\nglens, the hidden lakes, the umbrageous streams that leap and frolic\r\ndown the wild rocks of a country so rife with beauty as Greece.\r\nNevertheless, adhering strictly to truth and reality, there is, in such\r\nregions, much about the pastoral life to delight the mind. In the first\r\nplace, the occupations of an ancient shepherd left him great leisure,\r\nand he was generally, by habit no less than by inclination, led to prize\r\nthat “dolce far niente” which, in all southern climates, constitutes the\r\nchief enjoyment of existence.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1777:\r\n\r\n  The charm of that repose and freedom from care supposed to be tasted\r\n  in the seclusion of the country, appears in all ages to have led to\r\n  the belief, that there is something more natural in fields and forests\r\n  than in cities, though it be quite as necessary that man should have\r\n  dwellings as that he should cultivate the ground. The paradox,\r\n  however, is thus expressed by Varro: Divina natura dedit agros, ars\r\n  humana ædificavit urbes. De Re Rust. iii. 1, which Cowper,\r\n  unconsciously perhaps, has thus translated,\r\n\r\n               God gave the country, but man made the town.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnd indeed all the world over, repose, both of mind and body, is sweet.\r\nBut not entire repose. Accordingly the Grecian shepherd, whose flocks\r\nfed tranquilly, whose condition, assured, and pinched by no necessities,\r\nleft him at liberty to consult his own tastes in his recreations, took\r\nrefuge from idleness in music and song.[1778] At first, and perhaps\r\nalways, their lays were rude; but nature, their only teacher, infused\r\ninto them originality and passion, such as we find in the only poet of\r\nantiquity, save Homer, in whose verses the fragrance of the woods still\r\nbreathes. Whether like Paris and Anchises they kept their own flocks or\r\nundertook the care for others, they were still on the mountains\r\nperfectly free. Their education was peculiar. Abroad much after\r\ndark,[1779] in a climate where the summer nights are soft and balmy\r\nbeyond expression, and where the stars seem lovingly to crowd closer\r\nabout the earth, they necessarily grew romantic and superstitious.[1780]\r\nEvents occurring early in their own lives or handed down to them by\r\ntradition, long meditated on, were in the end invested with supernatural\r\nattributes. Under similar circumstances their national religion had\r\nprobably been first formed. They in the same way, in every canton,\r\ncreated a local religion.[1781] Their very creed was poetry. Tree, rock,\r\nmountain, spring, every thing was instinct with divinity, not\r\nmystically, as in certain philosophical systems, but literally; and, as\r\nthey believed, the immortal race, their invisible companions at all\r\nhours, could when they pleased put on visibility, or rather remove from\r\ntheir eyes the film which prevented their habitually beholding them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1778:\r\n\r\n  Travellers find among the modern shepherds of the East much the same\r\n  tastes and habits. “The hills,” observed Dr. Chandler, speaking of\r\n  Lydia, “were enlivened by flocks of sheep and goats, and resounded\r\n  with the rude music of the lyre and of the pipe; the former a stringed\r\n  instrument resembling a guitar, and held much in the same manner, but\r\n  usually played on with a bow.” Chandler, i. p. 85. Cf. Theocrit.\r\n  Eidyll. i. 7. viii. 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1779:\r\n\r\n  The same habits still prevail: “We could discern fires on Lesbos as\r\n  before on several islands and capes, made chiefly by fishermen and\r\n  shepherds, who live much abroad in the air, to burn the strong stalks\r\n  of the Turkey wheat and the dry herbage on the mountains.” Chandler,\r\n  i. 11. Cf. p. 320.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1780:\r\n\r\n  Among other things we find them putting the strongest faith in\r\n  dreams—at least we may suppose the fishermen in Theocritus, who lay so\r\n  much stress on the visions of the night, to hold a creed pretty nearly\r\n  akin to that of shepherds. Eidyll. 21. v. 29. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1781:\r\n\r\n  The gods they principally worshiped were Pan, the Muses, and the\r\n  Nymphs. To the Nymphs and Pan they sacrificed as to gods presiding\r\n  over mountains, where they themselves usually wandered. Pan, moreover,\r\n  was skilled in the pipe, the instrument of their race. The Muses they\r\n  adored as the goddesses of poetry and music. Schol. Theoc. i. 6. In\r\n  verse 12 of the same Eidyll. the Nymphs are spoken of where the office\r\n  of the Muses is in contemplation, which may easily be explained. For\r\n  the Muses are properly the Nymphs of those fountains which inspire\r\n  poets with their lays. Cf. Voss. ad Virg. Eclog. iii. 84. By the\r\n  Lydians the Muses were denominated Nymphs.

And this in the heroic ages was likewise the case in\r\nGreece,[1782] where youths of the noblest families watched over their\r\nfathers’ sheep and cattle. Thus Bucolion, son of Laomedon, led to\r\npasture the flocks of his sire, and, in the solitudes of the Phrygian\r\nmountains, was met and loved by a nymph.[1783] Two sons also of Priam\r\npursued the same occupation;[1784] and thus among the Hebrews, David,\r\nthe son of Jesse, passes his youth in the sheepfold, and his manhood on\r\na throne. In this secluded and solitary life the sights and sounds of\r\nnature became familiar to them, the voice of sudden torrents rushing\r\nfrom the mountains,[1785] the roar of lions springing on their folds, or\r\nthe sweet moonlight silvering both mountain and valley. It is with the\r\nshepherd’s life that Homer connects that noble description of the night\r\nwhich Chapman has thus translated:\r\n\r\n As when about the silver moon, when air is free from wind,[1786]\r\n And stars shine clear,[1787] to whose sweet beams high prospects and the\r\n    brows\r\n Of all steep hills and pinnacles thrust up themselves for shows,\r\n And even the lonely valleys joy to glitter in their sight,\r\n When the unmeasured firmament bursts to disclose her light,\r\n And all the signs in heaven are seen, that glad the shepherd’s heart.\r\n\r\nThe glimpses of pastoral life, albeit too few, are still frequent in\r\nHomer, who loves, whenever possible, to illustrate his subject by\r\nbringing before our minds the image of a shepherd. Thus Hector, lifting\r\na large rock, is compared to a shepherd bearing a ram’s fleece.[1788]\r\n\r\n As when the fleece, though large yet light, the careful shepherd rears,\r\n With both hands plunged within its folds, so he the rock uptears.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1782:\r\n\r\n  Lycoph. Cassand. 91, seq. in common with Homer and the other ancient\r\n  poets, represent princes as shepherds. The guarding of flocks was\r\n  then, in fact, a regal occupation. Didymos, ad Odyss. ν. 223,\r\n  observes, that τὸ παλαιὸν καὶ οἱ τῶν βασιλέων παίδες πανάπαλοι (l.\r\n  παναίπολοι) ἐκαλοῦντο, καὶ ἐποίμαινον. Meurs. ad Lycoph. p. 1181.\r\n  Varr.

The shepherd’s pipe,[1798] frequently\r\nmade of the donax, or common river-reed,[1799] likewise used in\r\nthatching cottages, formed a no less necessary accompaniment. Another of\r\ntheir instruments of music was the flute crooked at the top, finely\r\npolished and rubbed with bees’ wax.[1800]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1795:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Rep. iv. t. vi. p. 204.

The feeding of herds and flocks constituted the principal\r\noccupation of the Proselenoi,[1802] who were little devoted to\r\nagriculture, as may be inferred from their acorn-eating habits; for no\r\nnation ever continued to feed on mast after they could obtain bread. A\r\nreport prevailed in the ancient world that the Arcadians were of a\r\npoetical temperament, to which Virgil alludes in the well-known verses—\r\n\r\n                                   Arcades ambo,\r\n                 Et cantare pares et respondere parati.\r\n\r\nAnd as improvisatori they may possibly have excelled, though Greece knew\r\nnothing of an Arcadian literature. However, chiefly after the example of\r\nVirgil, the poets of modern times have always delighted to convert\r\nArcadia into a kind of pastoral Utopia, which is done by Sannazaro,\r\nTasso, Guarini, Sir Philip Sydney, Daniel, and many others. Palmerius à\r\nGrentmesnil[1803] discovers something like the descendants of the\r\nArcadians among the Irish, whose pastoral taste for music he conceives\r\nto be commemorated by the triangular harp in the national insignia.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1801:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 22.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1802:\r\n\r\n  Etym. Mag. 690. 11.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1803:\r\n\r\n  “Sic et hodie audio Hibernos, qui pecuariam exercent, musicæ deditos,\r\n  et triangulari cithara (quam vocamus _harpe_) plerumque se oblectare\r\n  solere, unde aiunt insignia regni Hiberniæ fuisse olim et esse adhuc\r\n  tale musicum instrumentum.” Desc.

On\r\nthe inside of these skins the traitor Hermion wrote the letters which\r\nbetrayed the designs of his countrymen to the enemy in Laconia.[1805]\r\nOthers wore goatskin cloaks, which they likewise used as a coverlet at\r\nnight.[1806] Euripides introduces his chorus of satyrs complaining of\r\nthis miserable costume.[1807]\r\n\r\n                 “Much loved Bacchos where dost thou\r\n                 Lonely dwell afar,\r\n                 Shaking thy gold locks at eve\r\n                 Like a blazing star?\r\n                 While I thy minister am fain\r\n                 To serve this one-eyed Cyclop swain,\r\n                 A slave borne down by fortune’s stroke\r\n                 In a wretched goatskin cloak.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1804:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

But, as I have\r\nhinted above, their very great leisure,[1808] the accidents of their\r\noccupation, and the grand and regular march of natural phenomena in\r\nthose countries, often ripened their intellects beyond what the\r\ncondition of a modern heath-trotter renders credible. Thus, in the\r\nmountains of Chaldæa, astronomy and all its parasitical sciences took\r\nbirth among the shepherd race. From temperament and circumstances, the\r\ninhabitants of thinly-peopled tracts, if unvexed by wars, are profoundly\r\nmeditative. What they behold in serene indistraction gradually rouses\r\ntheir thoughts, and presenting itself again and again, attended always,\r\nas the phenomena of the heavens are, by the same accidents, compels them\r\nto study.[1809]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1808:\r\n\r\n  Lord Bacon considers the pastoral state preferable in some respects to\r\n  the agricultural:—“The two simplest and most primitive trades of life;\r\n  that of the shepherd (who by reason of his leisure, rests in a place,\r\n  and living in view of heaven, is a lively image of a contemplative\r\n  life) and that of the husbandman; where we see the favour of God went\r\n  to the shepherd and not to the tiller of the ground.”—Advancement of\r\n  Learning, p. 64. Shepherds made libations of milk to the Muses.\r\n  Theocrit. i. 143, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1809:\r\n\r\n  Even yet we find the shepherds of Greece retain some smack of\r\n  classical learning: “After dinner I walked out with a shepherd’s boy\r\n  to herbarise; my pastoral botanist surprised me not a little with his\r\n  nomenclature; I traced the names of Dioscorides, and Theophrastus,\r\n  corrupted, indeed, in some degree by pronunciation, and by the long\r\n  _series annorum_, which had elapsed since the time of these\r\n  philosophers, but many of them were unmutilated, and their virtues\r\n  faithfully handed down in the oral traditions of the country. My\r\n  shepherd boy returned to his fold not less satisfied with some paras\r\n  that I had given him, than I was in finding in such a rustic a\r\n  repository of ancient science.”—Sibth. in Walp. i. 66, seq. There is\r\n  in Sir John Fortescue, De Laudibus Legum Angliæ, translated by Robert\r\n  Mulcaster, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, a passage describing the\r\n  pastoral habits of our ancestors, and the intellectual superiority\r\n  they engendered, which appears to me so excellent, that I cannot\r\n  resist the temptation to introduce it here:—“England is so fertile and\r\n  fruitefull, that comparing quantity to quantity it surmounteth all\r\n  other landes in fruitefulnesse. Yea, it bringeth forth fruite of\r\n  itselfe, scant provoked by mann’s industrie and labour. For there the\r\n  landes, the fieldes, the groves, and the woodes, doe so aboundantlye\r\n  springe, that the same untilled doe commonly yield to their owners\r\n  more profite then tilled, though else they bee most fruitefull of\r\n  corne and graine. There also are fieldes of pasture inclosed with\r\n  hedges and ditches, with trees planted and growing uppon the same,\r\n  which are a defence to their heardes of sheepe and cattell, against\r\n  stormes and heate of the sunne; and the pastures are commonly watered,\r\n  so that cattell shutte and closed therein have no neede of keeping\r\n  neither by day, nor by night. For there bee no wolves, nor beares, nor\r\n  lyons, wherefore their sheepe lye by night in the fields, unkept\r\n  within their foldes wherewith their land is manured. By the meanes\r\n  whereof, the men of that countrie are scant troubled with any\r\n  painefull labour, wherefore they live more spiritually, as did the\r\n  ancient fathers, which did rather choose to keepe and feede cattell,\r\n  than to disturbe the quietnesse of the minde with care of husbandrie.\r\n  And heereof it cometh, that menne of this countrie are more apte and\r\n  fitte to discerne in doubtfull causes of great examination and triall,\r\n  than are menne whollye given to moyling in the ground; in whom that\r\n  rurall exercise engendereth rudeness of witte and minde.” chap. 29.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut solitude is less surely the nurse of science than of superstition.\r\nThe leaven, which in populous cities scarcely swells visibly in the\r\nbreast, ferments unrestrainedly in the depths of woods, in the\r\nhigh-piled recesses of mountains, in the gloom of caverns, where nature\r\ninvests itself with attributes which address themselves powerfully to\r\nthe heart, and appears almost to hold communion with its offspring.\r\nHence the wild mythologies of Nomadic races, which are not loose-hanging\r\ncreeds, to be put off and on like a cloak, but a belief inwrought into\r\ntheir souls, a part of themselves, and perhaps the best part, since it\r\nis from this that springs the whole dignity and poetry of their lives.\r\nIn all countries fables rise in the fields, to flow into and be lost in\r\nthe cities. Observe the wild picture which Plato, in his Academic Dream,\r\npresents to us of a group of Lydian shepherds. It has all the poetical\r\nelements of an Arabian tale.\r\n\r\nTradition, he says, represented Gyges the ancestor of Crœsus as a hired\r\nshepherd, who with many others guarded the imperial flocks in the\r\nremoter districts of the country. At this time happened a great\r\nearthquake, attended by floods of rain, which, in the parts where they\r\nwere, opened up a vast chasm in the earth. Gyges arriving alone at the\r\nmouth of the gap stood amazed at its depth and magnitude, but observing\r\na practicable descent went down, and roamed through its subterraneous\r\npassages. Many marvellous things, according to the mythos, did he there\r\nsee, and among the rest a hollow brazen horse, with doors in its side,\r\nthrough which looking in, he beheld a colossal naked corpse, with a\r\njewelled ring on its hand. Transferring this to his own finger Gyges\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, still wearing the signet, he went to the assembly of\r\nshepherds, which met monthly, for the purpose of selecting a person to\r\nbear the usual report of the flocks to the king. Sitting down among the\r\nrest he happened to turn the beavil of his ring towards himself, upon\r\nwhich he became invisible to his companions,[1810] as he clearly\r\ndiscovered from their discourse, which proceeded as if about an absent\r\nman. Smitten with much wonder he returned the gem to its former position\r\nand again became visible. He made the experiment over and over and\r\nalways with success; upon which, like another Macbeth, a vast scheme of\r\nambition darkly shadowed itself upon his mind, and a crown tinged\r\nslightly with blood swam before him. It does not, however, appear that\r\nlike the Thane of Cawdor he was perplexed with scruples. He does not\r\nsay,—\r\n\r\n            “Why do I yield to that suggestion,\r\n            Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,\r\n            And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,\r\n            Against the use of nature? Present facts\r\n            Are less than horrible imaginings.\r\n            My thought whose murder’s yet but phantasy,\r\n            Shakes so my single state of man, that function\r\n            Is smothered in surmise, and nothing is,\r\n            But what is not.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1810:\r\n\r\n  The reader will in this place perhaps remember the dream of Rousseau,\r\n  on the enjoyment which the possession of such a ring would have\r\n  afforded him; when after pushing his speculations as far as they could\r\n  go he determines that he was much better without it.—Rêveries du\r\n  Promeneur Solitaire, iii. 137.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nGyges, with the ruthless resolution of an Oriental, forms his plan at\r\nonce, and coolly works it out. He procures himself to be elected one of\r\nthe mission to the king, and on arriving at the capital, dishonours the\r\nqueen, murders his master, and ascends the throne.[1811]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1811:\r\n\r\n  Plat. Rep. ii. § 3. Cf. x. § 12. Stallb. Among the gods similar powers\r\n  were attributed to the helmet of Hades. Thus, in Homer, Athena is\r\n  concealed from Mars by the effect of this enchanted piece of\r\n  armour.—Iliad, ε. 845. Apollod. ii. 4. 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis may be regarded as a specimen of the shepherds’ tales.[1812] But\r\nthey moved for the most part in an atmosphere of superstition, had\r\nceremonies of their own, a mythology of their own, and of the whole the\r\npervading spirit was love. In communities highly civilised, this passion\r\ncommonly degenerates into a plaything, despised when weak, and\r\nmischievous when strong. It is otherwise in the early stages of society.\r\nThere, in proportion to their freedom from the aspirations and anxieties\r\nof ambition, men seek happiness in the cultivation of the affections.\r\nThe society of women is to them all in all. And the evils that infest\r\nthem, disturb their quiet, and engender crime, spring, too, from the\r\nsame bitter-sweet fountain, which flows with honey or gall according to\r\nthe temper of those who drink of it. Consequently, in contemplating the\r\npastoral life of Greece, we must beware not to overlook the\r\nshepherdesses,[1813] those heroines of Bucolic poetry, whose freshness\r\nand nature still survive in Theocritus, and other fragments of\r\nantiquity, and may operate as an antidote to that insipid spawn whose\r\nloves and lamentations affect us like ipecacuanha in modern pastorals.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1812:\r\n\r\n  To the same class belongs that tradition of a brazen tablet thrown up\r\n  by a fountain in Lycia foretelling the overthrow of the Persian\r\n  monarchy by the Greeks.—Plut. Alexand. § 17.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1813:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Varr. De Re Rust. ii. 10.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn these latitudes of society, at least, women enjoyed their freedom,\r\nand the glimpses presented to us of them as they there existed may be\r\nregarded among the chief charms of Greek poetry. Only, for example,\r\nobserve the picture which Chæremon the Flower Poet, has delineated of a\r\nbevy of beautiful virgins sporting by moonlight:\r\n\r\n “There one reclined apart I saw, within the moon’s pale light,\r\n With bosom through her parted robe appearing snowy white;\r\n Another danced, and floating free her garments in the breeze\r\n She seemed as buoyant as the wave that leaps o’er summer seas.\r\n While dusky shadows all around shrunk backward from the place,\r\n Chased by the beaming splendour shed like sunshine from her face:\r\n Beside this living picture stood a maiden passing fair\r\n With soft round arms exposed; a fourth with free and graceful air,\r\n Like Dian when the bounding hart she tracks through morning dew,\r\n Bared through the opening of her robes her lovely limbs to view.\r\n And oh! the image of her charms, as clouds in heaven above,\r\n Mirrored by streams, left on my soul the stamp of hopeless love.\r\n And slumbering near them others lay, on beds of sweetest flowers,\r\n The dusky petaled violet, the rose of Paphian bowers.\r\n The inula and saffron flower, which on their garments cast,\r\n And veils, such hues as deck the sky when day is ebbing fast;\r\n While far and near tall marjoram bedecked the fairy ground,\r\n Loading with sweets the vagrant winds that frolicked all around.”[1814]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1814:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 87.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary bucolic poets women to be sure are sketched with a rude\r\npencil, though coquettish as queens, of which we have an exemplification\r\nin the picture on the shepherd’s cup:[1815]\r\n\r\n  And there, by ivy shaded, sits a maid divinely wrought,\r\n  With veil and circlet on her brows, by two fond lovers sought.\r\n  Both beautiful with flowing hair, both sueing to be heard,\r\n  On this side one, the other there, but neither is preferred.\r\n  For now on this, on that anon, she pours her witching smile,\r\n  Like sunshine on the buds of hope, in falsehood all and guile,\r\n  Though ceaselessly, with swelling eyes, they seek her heart to move,\r\n  By every soft and touching art that wins a maiden’s love.[1816]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1815:\r\n\r\n  This was the κισσύβιον, a goblet or cup turned of ivy wood. It was\r\n  usually rubbed with wax and polished, for the purpose of bringing out\r\n  the beautiful carving which adorned it. Cf. Etym. Mag. 515. 33.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1816:\r\n\r\n  Theocrit. i. 32, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere is here no straining after the ideal. Like Titian’s beauties,\r\nthese shepherdesses are all creatures of this earth, filled with robust\r\nhealth, dark-eyed, warm, impassioned, and somewhat deficient in reserve.\r\nThey understand well how to act their part in a dialogue. For every bolt\r\nshot at them they can return another as keen. Each bower and bosky\r\nbourne seems redolent of their smiles; their laughter awakens the\r\nechoes; their ruddy lips and pearly teeth hang like a vision over every\r\nbubbling spring and love-hiding thicket which they were wont to\r\nfrequent. Hence the charm of Theocritus. And a still stronger charm\r\nperhaps would have belonged to the pages of him who should have painted\r\nthe shepherd’s life of a remoter age,[1817] when none were above such an\r\noccupation, which therefore united at once all the dignity of lofty\r\nindependence with the careless freedom of manners and unapprehensive\r\nenjoyment in which consists the secret source of all the pleasure which\r\nrustic pictures afford. Most of his creations, though not all, are in\r\nthis respect wanting. Ideas of penury[1818] slip in, and, in the midst\r\nof rich poetry, check the developement of pleasurable feelings. For the\r\nmusical swains, though apparently ambitious of nought but the reputation\r\nof song, permit us to discover, that they are but hirelings tending\r\nflocks not their own. The contrast between persons of this class and\r\nthose who are owners of the sheep they tend, is forcibly pointed out in\r\nthe sacred language of Christ: “I am the good shepherd: the good\r\nshepherd giveth his life for the sheep. But he that is an hireling and\r\nnot the shepherd and whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming,\r\nand leaveth the sheep and fleeth, and the wolf catcheth them and\r\nscattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth because he is a hireling, and\r\ncareth not for the sheep. I am the good shepherd and know my sheep and\r\nam known of mine. As the Father knoweth me even so know I the Father;\r\nand I lay down my life for the sheep.”[1819] The same affectionate\r\ntenderness is attributed to shepherds in the prophetic writings: “he\r\nshall feed his flocks like a shepherd, he shall gather the lambs with\r\nhis arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that\r\nare with young.”[1820]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1817:\r\n\r\n  Though even here we detect the presence of hirelings; for Homer\r\n  observes, that, among the Læstrigons, such shepherds as could do with\r\n  little sleep received double wages. Odyss. κ. 84, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1818:\r\n\r\n  In fact black slaves, from Africa, were sometimes employed as\r\n  shepherds, at least in Sicily. Theoc. i. 24.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1819:\r\n\r\n  John, x. 11, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1820:\r\n\r\n  Isaiah, xl. 11.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the matter of virtues and vices, the shepherds of antiquity were very\r\nmuch, no doubt, like other men. Their habits were such as grew naturally\r\nout of their position. Towards whatever their feelings led them they\r\nproceeded vehemently, and with that singleness of purpose which belongs\r\nto men of simple and decided character.[1821] They were too commonly\r\ncreatures of mere impulse. From the peculiar form of their communion\r\nwith nature, which, like the masses of Egyptian architecture, was\r\ncontinued and monotonous, they acquired a peculiarity of mental\r\ntemperament, warm, as it were, in parts, and cold in parts. Every\r\ncircumstance around them tended to rouse, pique, and inflame the passion\r\nof desire and its concomitants; the pairing of their flocks, of the\r\nbirds, of the very wild beasts whose courage or ferocity they dreaded;\r\ntheir own leisure combined with the excess of health, the influence of\r\nclimate, the solicitations of opportunity, impelled them into excess;\r\nand, accordingly, their morals in this respect sank to a low standard,\r\nand rendered them any thing but models of the golden age. The intellect\r\nof course was comparatively little cultivated; and there being no other\r\ncheck upon the feelings, suicides, murders of jealousy, and other\r\nevidences of ill-regulated passion would often occur.[1822]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1821:\r\n\r\n  It has been observed by Gibbon, who had diligently studied the\r\n  pastoral nations of Asia in their general habits and characteristics,\r\n  that ambition and the spirit of conquest are powerfully excited by the\r\n  shepherd’s manner of life. “The thrones of Asia have been repeatedly\r\n  overturned by the shepherds of the north, and their arms have spread\r\n  terror and devastation over the most fertile and warlike countries of\r\n  Europe. On this occasion, as well as on many others, the sober\r\n  historian is forcibly awakened from a pleasing vision and is compelled\r\n  with some reluctance to confess, that the pastoral manners which have\r\n  been adorned with the fairest attributes of peace and innocence are\r\n  much better adapted to the fierce and cruel habits of a military\r\n  life.” Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, iv. 348. Hippocrates in\r\n  his brief but vigorous manner has presented us with a picture of the\r\n  Scythian shepherd’s life in ancient times, (De Aër. et Loc. § 92,\r\n  sqq.) and from modern travellers we find that it differed very little\r\n  from that which they lead at the present day. See the travels of\r\n  Rubriquis in Hakluyt, i. 101, sqq. See also the notes of Coray on\r\n  Hippocrates, t. ii. 280, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1822:\r\n\r\n  Theocritus describes Daphnis dying for love. Eidyll. i. 135.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut, in proportion as we pierce further back into antiquity, these\r\ntragical incidents become fewer: not merely because our knowledge of\r\nthose ages is more scanty, but that in ruder times morality is\r\ncomparatively lax, and men’s taste less fastidious. The rigid laws of\r\nmarriage were then little observed. Women passed from husband to husband\r\nwithout losing character or caste; and when they produced illegitimate\r\noffspring attributed the paternity to some god, and scarcely considered\r\nthe circumstance a misfortune. Half the princes of the Homeric age were\r\nillegitimate; for this is what is always meant by saying they were\r\ndescended from the gods. Æneas was the son of some young woman whom\r\nAnchises met on the mountains, where he pastured his father’s flocks and\r\npretended to have been loved by Aphrodite.[1823] Persons so\r\ncircumstanced were, doubtless, capable of much romance. Nymphs and\r\ngoddesses peopled their imagination, and their imagination let loose its\r\nbrood upon the woods. Poets afterwards, able to infuse a soul into these\r\nrustic traditions, gave a local habitation and a name to every beautiful\r\nlegend they could collect. Hence that sunny picture, the interview of\r\nAphrodite and Anchises amid the lofty recesses, the grassy slopes, the\r\nsparkling leaping brooks, and old umbrageous forests of Mount Ida.\r\nAlready, however, the force of dress was known, which Montaigne\r\nafterwards celebrated; for the Homeric bard, about to record an\r\ninterview between the goddess and her shepherd-lover, instead of\r\nsupposing her to have been\r\n\r\n                  “When unadorned, adorned the most,”\r\n\r\ndescribes all the arts of a luxurious toilette.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1823:\r\n\r\n  Hom. Hymn. ad Ven. 54, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe picture, however, of pastoral life which he suggests rather than\r\ndescribes, is worked out with strokes of great simplicity. All the other\r\nherdsmen disperse in the execution of their several duties, leaving\r\nAnchises alone in the cattle-sheds,[1824] spacious in dimensions, and\r\ntastefully erected, where he amuses his solitary leisure with the music\r\nof the cithara. While thus engaged he beholds the approach of the\r\ngoddess,[1825] and is at once struck with her beauty and the splendour\r\nof her raiment. At the unearthly vision his love is kindled; but the\r\npoet, skilled in the mysteries of the heart, chastens his passion by\r\novermastering feelings of reverence, such as necessarily belong to\r\nunsophisticated youth. Anchises constitutes, indeed, the _beau idéal_ of\r\nan heroic shepherd, simple, high-minded, ingenuous, venturous and\r\nfearless in contests with man or beast, but in his intercourse with\r\nwoman gentle, reverent,\r\n\r\n                “And of his port as meek as is a maid.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, the gallant knights of romance seem rather to have been\r\nmodelled after the heroic warriors of Greece, than from any realities\r\nsupplied by the chivalrous ages. The author of the Hymn is careful in\r\ndescribing the shepherd’s couch, to insinuate with how great strength\r\nand courage he was endowed. He reclines, we are told, on skins of bears\r\nand lions slain by his own hand, though over these there were cast, for\r\nshow, garments of the softest texture.[1826]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1824:\r\n\r\n  Compare Trollope, Notes on St. John, x. i.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1825:\r\n\r\n  Aleuas, the Thessalian, is said to have been favoured with the visits\r\n  of a very different mistress as he pastured his herds on Mount Ossa,\r\n  near the Hæmonian spring; for a dragon of enormous size, becoming\r\n  enamoured of his beauty and golden hair, frequently approached the\r\n  shepherd with presents of game of her own catching. Having laid her\r\n  gifts at his feet, she would kiss his locks and lick his face with her\r\n  tongue, which, as the fountain was so near it, may be hoped was a work\r\n  of supererogation. Ælian. De Nat. Animal. viii. 11.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1826:\r\n\r\n  Hymn. ad Vener. 158, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThroughout this work it has been seen how the influence of climate and\r\nposition concurred in the formation of the Greek character. We may\r\nourselves put the doctrine to the proof by observing the effect upon our\r\nminds of those reflections of landscapes which appear in language; rude\r\nBoreal scenes exciting the spirit of contention and energy; while the\r\nsoft valleys, groves, and odoriferous gardens of the South produce a\r\ncalm upon our thoughts favourable to the more benevolent emotions.\r\nHellenic shepherds, therefore, no other causes preventing, may upon the\r\nwhole be supposed to have been humane.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the very curious adventures of a sophist,[1827] in the mountains\r\nof Eubœa, preserved among the literary wrecks of antiquity, open up to\r\nour view a picture of pastoral life which, in spite of much rudeness and\r\nindigence, exhibits the Greek character in its original roughness and\r\nsimplicity, full of kindness, full of gentleness, full of hospitable\r\npropensities, which would do honour to the noblest Arab Sheikh. And the\r\nmaterial scene itself, in every feature Grecian, harmonises exactly with\r\nthe moral landscape.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1827:\r\n\r\n  Dion Chrysostom. Orat. vii. t. i. p. 219, sqq.

As they go along he displays the\r\nknowledge wherewith experience stores the rustic mind. He understands\r\nthe signs of the weather, and from the clouds which cap the summits of\r\nCaphareus foretells how long the sea will continue unnavigable.[1832]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1828:\r\n\r\n  On this mountain and the mythological legends attached to it, see\r\n  Virg.

Pluv. i. 22.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRude as an American backwoodsman, he was precipitated, by the rare luck\r\nof meeting with a stranger, into equal inquisitiveness and garrulity. He\r\nput questions without waiting for an answer. He gossipped of his own\r\nconcerns; explained without being asked the whole economy of his life;\r\nand exhibited all that enthusiasm of beneficence which belongs to human\r\nnature when uncorrupted by the thirst of gold. There is a rare truth in\r\nthe description; far too much ever to have graced a sophist’s tale,\r\nunless nature had supplied the model.\r\n\r\n“There are two of us,” says he, “who inhabit together the same rude\r\nnook, having married sisters, by whom we have both sons and daughters.\r\nWe derive our subsistence principally from the chase, paying but little\r\nattention to agriculture, since we have no land of our own. Nor were our\r\nfathers better off in this respect than ourselves; for, though freeborn\r\ncitizens, they were poor, and by their condition constrained to tend the\r\nherds of another, a man of great property, owning vast droves of cattle,\r\nnumerous horses and sheep, several beautiful estates, with many other\r\npossessions, and all these mountains as far as you can see. This\r\nopulence, however, became his ruin. For the emperor, casting a covetous\r\neye upon his domains, put him to death, that he might have a pretext for\r\nseizing on them. Our few beasts went along with our master’s, and the\r\nwages due to us there was no one to pay.\r\n\r\n“Here, therefore, of necessity we remained[1833] where two or three huts\r\nwere left us, with a slight wooden shed in which the calves had been\r\nhoused in the summer nights.[1834] For, during winter, we had been used\r\nto descend for pasture to the plains where, in the proper season, stores\r\nof hay were also laid up; but with the re-appearance of summer we\r\nreturned again to the mountains. The spot which had formed our principal\r\nstation now became our fixed dwelling. Branching off on either hand is a\r\ndeep and shady valley, having in the middle a rivulet so shallow as to\r\nbe easily traversed, both by cattle and their young. This stream,\r\nflowing from a spring hard by, is pure and perennial and cooled by the\r\nsummer wind blowing perpetually up the ravine. The encircling forests of\r\noak stretch forth their boughs far above, over a carpet of soft verdure,\r\nwhich descends with a gentle slope into the stream, giving birth to a\r\nfew gad-flies,[1835] or any other insect hurtful to herds. Extending\r\naround are numerous lovely meadows, dotted with lofty trees, where the\r\ngrass is green and luxuriant throughout the year.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1833:\r\n\r\n  Had Bernardin de St. Pierre read this when he wrote his Indian\r\n  Cottage?\r\n\r\nFootnote 1834:\r\n\r\n  An equal degree of contentment to that which in this recital we find\r\n  exhibited by the Eubœan herdsmen, is still in our own times displayed\r\n  by the rough peasants of the Lipari islands, in the midst of far\r\n  greater privations:—“It is incredible at the same time how contented\r\n  these islanders are amid all their poverty. Ulysses perhaps cherished\r\n  not a greater love for his Ithaca than they bear to their Eolian rocks\r\n  which, wretched as they may appear, they would not exchange for the\r\n  Fortunate islands. Frequently have I entered their huts which seem\r\n  like the nests of birds hung to the cliffs. They are framed of pieces\r\n  of lava ill-joined together, equally destitute of ornament within and\r\n  without, and scarcely admitting a feeble uncertain light, like some\r\n  gloomy cavern.” Spallanzani, Travels in the Two Sicilies, iv. 147.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1835:\r\n\r\n  The absence of these tormentors of cattle was considered a matter of\r\n  great importance by the ancients. Virgil, where he is giving\r\n  directions respecting the best pastures suited to the youthful mothers\r\n  of the herds, celebrates the exploits of the gadfly:\r\n\r\n         Saltibus in vacuis pascant, et plena secundum\r\n         Flumina: muscus ubi, et viridissima gramine ripa,\r\n         Speluncæque tegant, et saxea procubet umbra.\r\n         Est lucos Silari circa, ilicibusque virentem\r\n         Plurimus Alburnum volitans, cui nomen asilo\r\n         Romanum est, œstrum Graii vertere vocantes:\r\n         Asper, acerba sonans: quo tota exterrita sylvis\r\n         Diffugiunt armenta; furit mugitibus æther\r\n         Concussus, sylvæque et sicci ripa Tanagri.\r\n                                           Georg. iii. 143, sqq.\r\n\r\n  See the note of Philargyrius in loc.

Opp. t. i. p. 9. To protect from pollution spots shaded by noble\r\n  trees they were accustomed to consecrate them to some god, and to\r\n  erect beneath the overhanging branches statues and altars. Id. ib. In\r\n  Crete the fountains are often shaded still by majestic plane-trees.\r\n  Pashley, ii. 31.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe conversion of these herdsmen into hunters is narrated by Dion with a\r\npatient simplicity worthy of Defoe. An air of solitude, snatched from\r\nRobinson Crusoe’s island, seems to breathe at his bidding over Eubœa.\r\nThe same education operates strange changes both in man and dog; and\r\nbringing them into hostile contact with wolves, wild boars, stags, and\r\nother large animals, gives the latter a taste for blood, and renders him\r\nfierce and destructive. Subsisting by the chase, they pursued it summer\r\nand winter, following both hares and fallow-deer by their tracks in the\r\nsnow. In their intervals of leisure they strengthened and beautified\r\ntheir dwellings, saw their children intermarry and grow up to succeed\r\nthem, without even once approaching any city or even village.\r\n\r\nThe style of hospitality prevalent among such men in antiquity differs\r\nvery little from that which one would now find in the hut of a\r\ngood-natured Albanian.[1837] Their industry rendered them independent,\r\nand their independence rendered them generous. By degrees their rustic\r\ncottages were surrounded by a garden and fruit-trees, their court was\r\nwalled in, and luxuriant vines hung their foliage and purple fruit over\r\nwindows and porch. On the arrival of a stranger, the wife takes her\r\nstation at table beside her husband. Their marriageable daughter, in the\r\nbloom and beauty of youth, aids her brothers in waiting at table, where\r\nhost and guest recline on highly raised divans of leaves covered with\r\nthe skins of beasts. The young maiden, like a rustic Hebe, pours out the\r\nwine, dark and fragrant, while the youths served up the dishes and then\r\nlaid out a table for themselves and dined together. And the sophist,\r\nversed in the courts of satraps and kings, conceived these rude hunters\r\nof the mountains the happiest and most enviable of mankind.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1837:\r\n\r\n  Or even in the shed of a Turkish shepherd in Asia Minor. Dr. Chandler\r\n  has a passage illustrative of the hospitality of pastoral tribes,\r\n  which is at once so picturesque and concise that I am tempted to\r\n  transcribe it: “About two in the morning our whole attention was fixed\r\n  by the barking of dogs, which, as we advanced, became exceedingly\r\n  furious. Deceived by the light of the moon we now fancied we could see\r\n  a village, and were much mortified to find only a station of poor\r\n  goatherds without even a shed, and nothing for our horses to eat. They\r\n  were lying wrapped in their thick capotes or loose-coats by some\r\n  glimmering embers, among the bushes in a dale under a spreading tree\r\n  by the fold. They received us hospitably, heaping on fresh fuel and\r\n  producing caimac or sour curds and coarse bread which they toasted for\r\n  us on the coals. We made a scanty meal, sitting on the ground lighted\r\n  by the fire and by the moon, after which sleep suddenly overpowered\r\n  me. On waking I found my companions by my side, sharing in the\r\n  comfortable cover of the Janizary’s cloak which he had carefully\r\n  spread over us. I was now much struck with the wild appearance of the\r\n  spot. The tree was hung with rustic utensils, the she-goats in a pen\r\n  sneezed and bleated and rustled to and fro; the shrubs, by which our\r\n  horses stood, were leafless, and the earth bare; a black cauldron with\r\n  milk was simmering over the fire, and a figure more than gaunt or\r\n  savage close by us was struggling on the ground with a kid whose ears\r\n  he had slit, and was endeavouring to cauterise with a piece of red-hot\r\n  iron.” Chandler, vol. i. 180, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut a pastoral picture is incomplete without love. The youthful beauty\r\nof Caphareus, hidden, like another Nouronihar[1838] from the world, is\r\naccordingly beloved by her cousin, an adventurous hunter like her sire,\r\nwho joins the family circle in the evening, accompanied by his father,\r\nbringing in his hand a hare as a present to his mistress. The old man\r\nsalutes the guest, the youth offers his present with a kiss, and\r\nimmediately undertakes the office of the girl, who thereupon resumes her\r\nplace beside her mother.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1838:\r\n\r\n  History of the Caliph Vathek. p. 102.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nObserving this arrangement, the stranger inquires whether she is not\r\nsoon to be married to some wealthy peasant, who might benefit the\r\nfamily, upon which the youth and maiden blush, and her father replies,\r\n\r\n“Nay, but she will take a husband, humble in rank, and like ourselves a\r\nhunter,” glancing at the same time at the lover.\r\n\r\n“How is it then that you wait?” inquired the stranger. “Do you expect\r\nhim from the village?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the father, “he is not far off; and so soon as we can fix\r\nupon a fortunate day the nuptials will be celebrated.”\r\n\r\n“And by what do you judge of a fortunate day?”\r\n\r\n“The moon must be approaching the full, the weather fair, and the\r\natmosphere transparent.”\r\n\r\n“And is the youth in reality an able hunter?”\r\n\r\n“I am,” said the young man, answering for himself, “in the chase of the\r\nstag or boar, as you yourself, if you please, shall judge to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“And did you take this hare, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“I did,” replied he with a smile, “having set a gin for him by\r\nnight;[1839] the weather being surpassing beautiful, and the moon larger\r\nthan it ever was before.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1839:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Philost. Icon. ii. 26, p. 851.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nUpon this both the old men laughed, and the lover abashed held his\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n“But,” observed the father of the maiden, “it is no fault of mine that\r\nthe solemnity is deferred; we only wait at your father’s desire, till a\r\nvictim can be purchased; for a sacrifice must be offered to the gods.”\r\n\r\n“With respect to the victim,” interposed the maiden’s younger brother,\r\n“he has long provided one, and a noble one too, which is now feeding\r\nbehind the cottage.”\r\n\r\n“And is it truly so?” demanded the old man.\r\n\r\n“It is,” replied the lad.\r\n\r\n“And where,” addressing the youth, “did you procure it?” inquired they.\r\n\r\n“When we took the wild sow,[1840] which was followed by her litter,”\r\nanswered he, “and the greater number, swifter than hares, made their\r\nescape; I hit one with a stone, and my companions coming up threw a skin\r\nover him. This I secured, and exchanged in the village for a young\r\ndomestic pig which has been fatted in a sty behind the house.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1840:\r\n\r\n  The wild hog is still one of the most common animals in the forests of\r\n  Greece and Asia Minor. Chandler, i. 77. Even wild bulls occasionally\r\n  make their appearance in the latter country. 176.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“I now understand,” exclaimed the father, “the cause of your mother’s\r\nmirth when I would wonder what that grunting could be, and how the\r\nbarley was disappearing so fast.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” observed the young man, “to be properly fatted our\r\nEubœan swine require acorns.[1841] However, if you will just step this\r\nway I will show her to you.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1841:\r\n\r\n  To this best and most economical food for hogs, Homer makes allusion\r\n  where he introduces the goddess Circe attending to her sty, which she\r\n  had filled with the transformed companions of Odysseus:\r\n\r\n                                τοῖσι δε Κίρκη\r\n           Πὰρ ῥ’ ἄκυλον, βάλανον τ᾽ ἔβαλεν, καρπόν τε κρανείης\r\n           Ἔδμεναι, οἷα σύες χαμαιευνάδες αἰὲν ἔδουσιν.\r\n                            Od. κ. 241, sqq. Cf. ν. 409.\r\n\r\n  Ælian de Nat. Animal. v. 45, celebrates these Homeric dainties as the\r\n  food of the hog to which he elsewhere adds the fruit of the ash. viii.\r\n  9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nUpon which off they went, the boys quite at a run, and in vast glee.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the maiden going into the other cottage, brought forth\r\na quantity of split service-berries,[1842] medlars,[1843] and winter\r\napples, and bunches of superb grapes, bursting ripe,[1844] and, brushing\r\ndown the table, she spread them out there upon a layer of clean fern.\r\nNext moment the lads returned bringing in the pig, with much joking and\r\nshouts of laughter. Then came, too, the young man’s mother, with two of\r\nhis little brothers, and they brought along with them nice white loaves,\r\nwith boiled eggs in wooden salvers, with a quantity of parched peas.\r\nHaving embraced her brother, with his wife and daughter, she sat down\r\nbeside her husband, and said,\r\n\r\n“Behold the victim, which my son has long fed for his marriage, and the\r\nother things also are ready; both the barley-meal and the flour. A\r\nlittle wine, perhaps, may be wanting, but even this we can easily\r\nprocure from the village.”\r\n\r\nAnd her son standing near her, fixed his eyes wistfully upon his\r\nfather-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe latter smilingly observed,—\r\n\r\n“All delay now is on the lover’s part, who, perhaps, is anxious to\r\nfatten his pig.”\r\n\r\n“As to her,” said the youth, “she is bursting with fat.”\r\n\r\nUpon this the sophist, willing to aid the lover, interposed, and\r\nremarked,—\r\n\r\n“But you must take care lest while the pig is fattening he himself grow\r\nthin.”\r\n\r\n“The stranger’s remark is just,” said his mother; “for already he is\r\nmore meagre than he used to be; and I have of late observed him to be\r\nwakeful at night, and to go forth from the cottage.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! that,” said he, “was when the dogs barked, and I stepped out to see\r\nwhat was the matter.”\r\n\r\n“Not you!” said his mother,—“but went moping about. Let us, therefore,”\r\ncontinued she, “put him to no further trial.”\r\n\r\nAnd throwing her arms about her sister, the maiden’s mother, she kissed\r\nher; whereupon the latter, addressing her husband, said,—\r\n\r\n“Let us grant them their desire.”\r\n\r\nTo which he agreed; and it was resolved, that the marriage should be\r\nsolemnized in three days, the stranger being invited to remain and\r\nwitness it, which he did.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1842:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Pollux,[1846] however,\r\nreckons the goatherd next after the herdsman, and again inverts the\r\norder. Varro, on the other hand, gives precedence to the shepherd as the\r\nmost ancient, the sheep, in his opinion, having been the animal earliest\r\ntamed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1845:\r\n\r\n  Robust persons, with loud voices, were ordinarily chosen for herdsmen,\r\n  while goatherds were selected for their lightness and agility.

In some parts of Arabia another more\r\ncurious breed was found, with tails three cubits in length, to carry\r\nwhich they were supplied by the ingenuity of the shepherds with wooden\r\ncarriages.[1849]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1847:\r\n\r\n  Arist.

They were carefully roofed over, and every other precaution\r\nwas taken to render them perfectly dry, the floor being usually pitched\r\nwith stones, and slightly inclined. Their bedding[1851] consisted of\r\ncalaminth and asphodel and pennyroyal and polion (a sort of herb whose\r\nleaves appear white in the morning, of a purple colour at noon, and blue\r\nwhen the sun sets[1852]) and fleabane and southernwood and\r\norigany,[1853] all which repel vermin. The more completely to effect the\r\nsame purpose, they were, likewise, in the habit of fumigating the cotes\r\nfrom time to time, by burning in them several locks of some\r\nshepherdess’s hair,[1854] together with gum ammoniac, hartshorn, the\r\nhoofs or hair of goats, bitumen, cassia, fleabane, or calaminth, for the\r\nsmell of which serpents were thought to have a peculiar aversion.[1855]\r\nTheir ordinary food, while in the folds, consisted of green clover and\r\ncytisus, fenugreek, oaten and barley straw, and vegetable stalks,[1856]\r\nwhich were supposed to be improved if sprinkled on the threshing-floor\r\nwith brine, figs blown down by the wind, and dry leaves.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1850:\r\n\r\n  Bound together, probably, by wild succory or cneoron, as in modern\r\n  times by the withe-wind.

Animal. xvi. 32, that the rustics of Cios, on account\r\n  of the aridity of the island, possessed few flocks. Those they had,\r\n  however, were fed entirely on the leaves of the cytisus, the fig-tree,\r\n  and the olive, mingled occasionally with the straw and halm of\r\n  vegetables. The lambs reared on this island were of singular beauty,\r\n  and sold at a higher price than those of most other parts. In Lydia\r\n  and Macedonia sheep were sometimes fattened upon fish, which must have\r\n  given the mutton of those countries a somewhat unsavoury odour. Ælian.\r\n  De Nat. Animal. xv. 5. Another favourite food of sheep was the leaves\r\n  of the white nymphæa, the tender shoots of which were eaten by swine,\r\n  while men themselves fed upon the fruit. Theoph. Hist. Plant. iv. 10.\r\n  7. Children, too, it is said, regarded as a delicacy the stalks of the\r\n  phleos, the typha, and the butomos. The roots of this fruit were given\r\n  as food to cattle. Id. ibid.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the short and sharp days of winter,[1857] they were not led forth to\r\npasture till both the dew and the hoar frost had disappeared; but in\r\nsummer the shepherds were careful to be a-field with the dawn while the\r\ndew was still heavy on the grass. In Attica[1858] and the environs of\r\nMiletus, where was produced the finest and costliest wool in the ancient\r\nworld, the sheep[1859] were protected from rain and dust and brambles\r\nand whatever else could damage their fleeces[1860] by housings of purple\r\nleather.[1861] The same practice prevailed also in the Megaris, where\r\nDiogenes beholding a flock of sheep[1862] thus clad, while the children,\r\nlike those of the Egyptian peasants were suffered to run about naked,\r\nsaid, “It is better to be a Megarean’s ram than his son.” Ælian[1863]\r\nalludes to this saying for the purpose of noticing the ignorance and\r\nwant of education prevalent among the Megareans. We find likewise in\r\nPlutarch[1864] another version of the anecdote taxing these Dorians with\r\navarice and meanness. Augustus imitated the saying of Diogenes and\r\napplied it to Herod, hearing of whose cruelty to his family, he said,\r\n“It were better to be Herod’s hog than his son.”[1865] But if the\r\nMegareans lived poorly they built grandly: so that of them it was said,\r\nthat they ate as if they were to die to-morrow, and built as if they\r\nwere to live for ever.[1866]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1857:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xviii. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1858:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Athen, v. 60. Hom. Il. β. 305, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1859:\r\n\r\n  Those of the neighbouring country of Bœotia are now, however, more\r\n  highly valued. “Flocks of sheep whose fleeces were of a remarkable\r\n  blackness were feeding on the plain; the breed was considerably\r\n  superior in beauty and size to that of Attica.” Sibth. in Walp. i. 65.\r\n  To dream of sheep of this colour was regarded by the ancients as\r\n  unlucky. Artemid. Oneirocrit. ii. 12. p. 96. The finest black sheep in\r\n  the ancient world were found in a district of Phrygia in the\r\n  neighbourhood of the cities of Colossè and Laodicea, the wool of which\r\n  not only exceeded that of Miletos in softness, but was of a glossy jet\r\n  colour like that of the raven’s wing.

The picturesque features of the scene were in old\r\ntimes enhanced by the addition of several accompaniments now nowhere to\r\nbe found, consisting of statues, altars, or chapels, erected in honour\r\nof the rural gods or nymphs.[1869] Fountains, moreover, of limpid\r\nwater[1870] in many places gushed forth from beneath the trees, where\r\nthere were usually a number of seats for the accommodation of the\r\nshepherds and shepherdesses. In these retreats they generally passed the\r\nsultry hours of the day, playing on the pastoral flute or the syrinx,\r\nchanting their wild lays, or amusing each other by the relation of those\r\nstrange legends which inhabited the woods and lonely mountains of\r\nGreece.[1871] There prevailed among them a superstition against\r\ndisturbing by their music or otherwise that hushed stillness which most\r\npersons must have observed to characterise the summer noon. At this hour\r\nof the day the God Pan,[1872] in the opinion of Greek shepherds, took\r\nhis rest after the toils of the chase, reclining under a tree in the\r\nsolitary forest;[1873] and, as he was held to be of a hasty choleric\r\ndisposition, they abstained at that time from piping through fear of\r\nprovoking his anger. The other Gods likewise were believed to enjoy a\r\nshort sleep at this time, as we find in the case of the nymph Aura, in\r\nthe Dionysiacs.[1874]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1867:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xviii. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1868:\r\n\r\n  Nor in Asia Minor is the shade of trees always deemed sufficient. “We\r\n  came,” says Dr. Chandler, “to a shed formed with boughs round a tree,\r\n  to shelter the flocks and herds from the sun at noon.” Travels, i. 25.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1869:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

The\r\n  flowering ash hung from the sides of the mountain, under the shade of\r\n  which bloomed saxifrages, and the snowy Isopyrum, with the Campanula\r\n  Pyramidalis; this latter plant is now called χαρισονη; it yields\r\n  abundance of a sweet milky fluid, and was said to promote a secretion\r\n  of milk, a quality first attributed to it under the doctrine of\r\n  signatures. Our guide made nose-gays of the fragrant leaves of the\r\n  Fraxinella; the common nettle was not forgotten as a pot-herb, but the\r\n  Imperatoria seemed to be the favourite salad. Among the shrubs I\r\n  noticed our gooseberry-tree, and the Cellis Australis grew wild among\r\n  the rocks.” Walp. Mem. i. 63.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1871:\r\n\r\n  See Hesiod.

De Quiete Dei, p. 16, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom a passage in St. John’s gospel it would appear, that the practice\r\nprevailed among the Oriental shepherds of distinguishing the several\r\nmembers of their flocks by separate names: “The sheep hear his voice,\r\nand he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out. And when he\r\nputteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them, and the sheep follow\r\nhim, for they know his voice.” We likewise find traces of the same\r\ncustom in Sicily, Crete, and various other parts of Greece, where goats,\r\nand heifers, and sheep, enjoyed the privilege of a name, as Cynœtha,\r\nAmalthea, and others. In later times it was judged preferable, that the\r\nflock should follow their shepherds by the eye, for which reason they\r\nwere accustomed to stuff their ears with wool.[1875] To prevent rams\r\nfrom butting, they used to bore a hole[1876] through their horns near\r\nthe roots. Sheep were generally shorn[1877] during the month of May, and\r\nafter the wool had been clipped, they were commonly anointed with wine,\r\noil, and the juice of bitter lupins.[1878] In remoter ages the practice\r\nprevailed of plucking off the wool instead of shearing it; and this\r\nbarbarous method, at once so painful to the sheep and so laborious to\r\nthe shepherd, had not been entirely abandoned in the age of Pliny.[1879]\r\nIt was a rule among the pastoral tribes, that the number of their flocks\r\nshould be uneven.[1880] The shepherds of Greece bestowed the name of\r\nSekitai,[1881] (from σηκος an enclosure) upon lambs taken early from the\r\newes, and fed by hand. They were usually kept in a cote apart from the\r\nother sheep.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1875:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xviii. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1876:\r\n\r\n  Ferocia ejus cohibetur cornu juxta aurem terebrato.

To the same purpose writes also\r\n  Columella:—Epicharmus Syracusanus qui pecudum medicinas diligentissime\r\n  conscripsit affirmat pugnacem arietem mitigari terebra secundum\r\n  auriculas foratis cornibus qua curvantur in flexu. Columell. vii. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1877:\r\n\r\n  It is observed by the ancients that long lank wool indicated strength\r\n  in the sheep, curly wool the contrary.

Theoc. i. 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs flocks, in most parts of Greece, were exposed to the rapacity of the\r\nwolf,[1882] the shepherds had recourse to an extraordinary contrivance,\r\nto destroy this fierce animal; kindling large charcoal fires in open\r\nspaces in the woods, they cast thereon the powder of certain diminutive\r\nfish, caught in great numbers along the grassy shores of Greece,\r\ntogether with small slices of lamb and kid. Attracted by the savour\r\nwhich they could snuff from a distance, the wolves flocked in great\r\nnumbers towards the fires, round which they prowled with loud howlings,\r\nin expectation of sharing the prey, the odour of which had drawn them\r\nthither. Stupified at length by the fumes of the charcoal, they would\r\ndrop upon the earth in a lethargic sleep, when the shepherds coming up\r\nknocked them on the head.[1883]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1882:\r\n\r\n  From the relations of travellers it would appear that the method\r\n  observed by the ancient Greeks in ridding themselves of the wolf is no\r\n  longer known to their descendants, though the apprehension of their\r\n  destructiveness and ferocity be as great as ever. Solon, it is well\r\n  known set a price in his laws on the head of a wolf, which appears to\r\n  have varied in different ages; (cf. Plut. Solon. § 23. Schol.\r\n  Aristoph. Av. 369;) but could never have amounted to the sum of two\r\n  talents. Whatever the ancient price may have been, however, it was\r\n  paid by the magistrates; but “the peasant now produces the skins in\r\n  the bazaar or market, and is recompensed by voluntary contributions.”\r\n  Chandler, ii. p. 145. Close by a khan on mount Parnes, which is\r\n  covered with pine trees, Sir George Wheler saw a very curious\r\n  fountain, to which the wolves, bears, and wild boars commonly descend\r\n  to drink. Id. p. 197.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1883:\r\n\r\n  Geop. xviii. 14. Nevertheless, when a wolf bit a sheep without killing\r\n  it, the flesh was supposed to be rendered more tender and delicate, an\r\n  effect which Plutarch attributes to the hot and fiery breath of the\r\n  beast.
