For several years she\r\n  had been collecting material, leaving no stone unturned to get\r\n  at facts and records from the earliest times, and at last she\r\n  was arranging for its publication. Her modest estimate of the\r\n  value of her work made her often anxious, but her keen love of\r\n  investigating the antiquities of her neighbourhood and country\r\n  kept her always eager. To a kindred spirit nothing could be more\r\n  interesting than to visit with her some old hall or farm or\r\n  even a site which her historic knowledge could furnish with its\r\n  original buildings, and people with its old-world inhabitants.\r\n  What she most desired was to see for herself what she wished to\r\n  write about, or, if that were impossible, something similar which\r\n  still existed, and she had a genius for reconstructing, which\r\n  made her deductions and suggestions singularly valuable.\r\n\r\n  She was at no time strong, and for this reason her work was\r\n  perpetually liable to interruption, still her indomitable courage\r\n  and her endless patience enabled her to do wonders, and, though\r\n  never able to work for long together, bit by bit she got through\r\n  a great deal. How hard she worked and how carefully, no one\r\n  who reads her book, and sees the number of facts she has got\r\n  together, and notes the numerous references to books which she\r\n  had examined, can fail to perceive. Over and over again she\r\n  had to give in for a time, but her bright intelligence quickly\r\n  reasserted itself, and she was ready on most days to discuss the\r\n  subjects which for the time absorbed her. And this she did with\r\n  a delighted eagerness, and always with that humour which is the\r\n  salt of all conversation and companionship. On birds and their\r\n  habits she spoke with authority, and could always contribute much\r\n  valuable information obtained by personal observation. Generally\r\n  the first to hear and see the newly arrived summer migrants, and\r\n  able to distinguish the note of each, she thought no trouble too\r\n  great if it led to the chance of seeing some rare kind nesting in\r\n  the neighbourhood. Equally keenly would she follow up the threads\r\n  of some local history, for she had the true scientific spirit\r\n  and a genuine passion for archæology, so that by constant study\r\n  she had accumulated a surprising mass of information relating to\r\n  old historic Westmorland, and to Ambleside, Rydal and Grasmere\r\n  in particular. Of Ambleside she has already published a little\r\n  pamphlet, called _Ambleside Town and Chapel_. The present volume\r\n  is her completed work on Grasmere; and the History of Rydal, and\r\n  more especially of Rydal Hall, a more considerable work on which\r\n  she had been engaged for many years, has advanced so far that we\r\n  hope soon to see it published. Indeed some chapters of it have\r\n  already appeared in the columns of the _Westmorland Gazette_.\r\n\r\n  We had long ago arranged that I should help in seeing her work\r\n  through the press; and with her usual thoroughness and care, she\r\n  had got the present volume so far ready that my task has been but\r\n  a superficial one, accompanied throughout by the \"one pure image\r\n  of regret\" that she did not live to see, herself, the fruits of\r\n  her long labour.\r\n\r\n  W.

It has become\r\nthe Shrine of Nature and Poetry, for within its graveyard lies\r\nburied nature's austerest and most sincere interpreter. The\r\nnatural beauty of the spot, combined with its associations,\r\nhas given rise to a copious literature; and its praises have\r\nbeen rehearsed in poetry and prose of a high order. But by the\r\nhistorian Grasmere has been neglected. Its geographical position\r\nhas tended to its eclipse. In ancient times locked up from the\r\nworld in the farthest chamber of the mountains, and still the\r\nremotest parish of Westmorland (itself a neglected county),\r\nit has missed the attention of the careful chronicler, and no\r\nserious attempt has been made to penetrate its past. James Torre\r\n(1649-1699) indeed in his MS. collections for a history of the\r\nArchdeaconry of Richmondshire, compiled a list of five rectors\r\nwho had served the parish of Grasmere before the Reformation; but\r\nno searcher has followed up his efforts. Nor has the excellent,\r\nthough necessarily limited, information given in the pages of\r\nNicolson and Burn (1770) been since filled up or supplemented.\r\n\r\nThe following historical sketch makes no pretensions to\r\ncompleteness, which would be beyond both the writer's powers and\r\nopportunities. It began as a small thing, a chapter merely in the\r\nyet unfinished \"Chronicles of Rydal.\" But there seemed a need for\r\nthe publication of such facts as had been gathered together; and\r\nin response to an expressed desire, the sketch that had been laid\r\nby was overhauled, expanded and prepared for press. It contains\r\n(there is little doubt) some unsuspected errors and oversights,\r\nfor which the reader's leniency is asked.\r\n\r\nThe information has been collected from many sources, public,\r\nprivate, and traditional. The earliest comes from the Record\r\nOffice, where there are treasures still to be explored. For\r\nthe seventeenth century--and particularly the period of the\r\nCivil Wars--the MSS. at Rydal Hall have yielded facts of great\r\ninterest, especially those culled from the account-sheets of\r\nMr. Richard Harrison, who was agent and executor of Squire John\r\nFleming.\r\n\r\nFrom all sources, however, the information obtained is\r\nfragmentary, and facts are disappointingly isolated. Always there\r\nis something beyond, that we want to know and cannot find out;\r\nand so the story of the great Restoration Tithe Dispute has no\r\nending. The Presentments have been only available for a limited\r\nnumber of years. The church registers are defective. Even the\r\nchurch-wardens' accounts, which begin at the Restoration, are not\r\ncomplete. It is fortunate, however, that the second volume of\r\nthese accounts, long missing, and strangely recovered from papers\r\nfound at the house of descendants of a former parish clerk, was\r\ncopied before it was again lost. There is a gap of seven years\r\nbetween the third volume and this copy, owing no doubt to the\r\nlast leaves of the second volume having been torn off.[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] Vol. I. ends in 1735. Vol. II. overlaps four years and begins\r\n  in 1732, but the pages from 1734 to 1739 and from 1743 to 1750\r\n  are missing, and no entries are made for 1778 and 1779. The vol.\r\n  ends in 1883.--ED.\r\n\r\nThe writer has received more help and kindness than can well be\r\nacknowledged. Thanks are specially due to Mr. Stanley le Fleming and\r\nSir Gerald Strickland for granting ready access to their muniments;\r\nto Dr. Magrath, author of _The Flemings in Oxford_; to the Revs. W.\r\nJennings, J. H. Heywood, and M. F. Peterson for permitting the church\r\ndocuments to be consulted; to Messrs. W. Farrer, J. A. Martindale,\r\nand George Browne for their kind contributions of antiquarian\r\nknowledge; to Mr. W. Buckton I am indebted for the plan of the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\nHOW THE CHURCH WAS FOUNDED IN NORTHUMBRIA\r\n\r\n\r\nAll history begins with geography. Grasmere was from early times\r\nthe centre of a parish that embraced the twin valleys of Rothay\r\nand Brathay, whose waters drain into the lake of Windermere, while\r\nthe lake empties itself into the great bay of Morecambe. Therefore\r\nGrasmere has always belonged politically to the fertile region\r\nround about the bay, and the history of that region--from the time\r\nwhen the Celt enjoyed it, onward through its conquest by the Angle,\r\nits aggregation with the province of Deira and the kingdom of\r\nNorthumbria, still onward through its conversion to Christianity and\r\nits connection with the central church government at York as part\r\nof the Archdeaconry of Richmondshire--is the history of Grasmere\r\nherself: and to understand the origin of her church, it is necessary\r\nto briefly indicate the main events in the kingdom of Northumbria and\r\nthe Church of York.\r\n\r\nThe actual rise of Christianity within the valleys can only be\r\nconjectured. The Celts who dwelt here through the rule of the Roman\r\nmay not have embraced the faith, but some whisper of Saint Ninian's\r\nmission must surely have come to them, if not his direct teaching,\r\nas he passed on his way from Rome through Cumberland, to found at\r\nWhithorn in Galway a new religious community, like the one his great\r\nteacher Saint Martin had founded at Tours. The mission of Saint\r\nPatrick too, who in the fifth century returned to finish the work\r\nof conversion and church establishment in Ireland, must have been\r\nnoised abroad, for his name is imprinted on many a spot hereabouts;\r\nPatterdale or Patricdale,[2] with its well named after him, being\r\ndistant barely ten miles from Grasmere.\r\n\r\n  [2] Inquisition post mortem of William de Lancaster, 1246.\r\n\r\nThe holy Kentigern is known to have made missionary excursions from\r\nCarlisle into the mountains, before 573; and Crosthwaite, where he\r\nplanted a cross, is but 13 miles from Grasmere, along the line of\r\nthe Roman road from Kendal to Old Carlisle. With this artery of\r\ncommunication open, it is impossible that tidings of the new faith\r\nshould not have reached our valley before the close of the sixth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nSoon these tidings were to come from the east as well as the west,\r\nborne by the triumphant arms of the invading Angles. Truly Ethelfrith\r\nwho, in winning the battle of Chester, first laid our mountain\r\nfastnesses open to his kingdom of Northumbria, was a heathen; but his\r\nsuccessor Edwin embraced Christianity and brought Paulinus, a member\r\nof Saint Augustine's mission, to preach the gospel (627). At York,\r\nthe capital of the kingdom, a Christian church was built, a second\r\none even being started in stone to replace the wooden structure; and\r\nthe new bishop moved about with the king and his court, preaching and\r\nbaptizing. The valleys of Northumberland and Yorkshire, which were\r\nthe scenes of his labours, are named by Bede, who knew them well; but\r\nit is not known that he crossed into Westmorland.\r\n\r\nEdwin's overthrow gave Northumbria to the pagan king of Mercia, but\r\nit was soon regained by Oswald, who identified himself completely\r\nwith the new faith. He brought Aidan, who had been educated in the\r\nCeltic Church (now firmly settled in Scotland) to fill the place of\r\nthe departed Paulinus. But instead of taking up the bishop's seat\r\nat York, Aidan with the strong predilection shown by his church\r\nfor island-sanctuaries, chose Lindisfarne to be the centre of his\r\nmissionary efforts in Northumbria. Here Finan succeeded him in 651,\r\nand rebuilt the first rude edifice, constructing it of hewn oak\r\nthatched with reeds.\r\n\r\nKing Oswald (slain at Maserfeld, 642) was shortly after succeeded\r\nby Oswy, an ardent disciple of the new faith, as was Alchfrith his\r\nson. Alchfrith acted as sub-king in Northumbria under his father.[3]\r\nHe endowed a monastery at Ripon, which was presumably within his\r\ndominion, and placed there Eata, abbot of Melrose, with a little\r\nband of Scotic monks. At this time there was a young priest named\r\nWilfrith, lately returned from a journey to Rome (658), with whom\r\nAlchfrith made fast friends. Convinced by Wilfrith that the practices\r\nof the Anglo-Scotic church, where they differed from those of\r\nWestern Europe, were mistaken, he turned out the monks of Ripon,\r\nwhen they refused to alter their customs, and gave the establishment\r\nover to Wilfrith, to rule as abbot. The kings attempted to settle\r\nthe differences of practice between the churches at the synod of\r\nWhitby (664), where the counsels of the Roman party under Wilfrith\r\nprevailed; and this caused the retirement of Colman, bishop of\r\nNorthumbria, who refused to conform. It was now necessary to supply\r\nhis place, and the kings, father and son, seem without disagreement\r\nto have selected each his own man, presumably for his own province;\r\nthus making two bishops instead of one.[4] While Alchfrith chose\r\nWilfrith for his bishop, and sent him to Gaul for consecration, Oswy\r\nchose Chad, sending him to Kent to be consecrated as Bishop of York\r\n\"for him and his\" by the Archbishop. But by the time that Wilfrith\r\nhad returned from his foreign journey, things were changed at the\r\ncourt. Alchfrith was dead, possibly slain in rebellion against his\r\nfather; and Wilfrith, deprived of his patron, settled down quietly at\r\nRipon as abbot, while Chad ruled the whole church of Northumbria from\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n  [3] Bishop Browne in _Theodore and Wilfrith_, pp. 20 and 36,\r\n  inclines to the opinion that this sub-kingdom embraced the\r\n  western rather than the southern portion of Northumbria, as\r\n  generally supposed, in which case it would include those portions\r\n  of Lancashire and the western coasts northwards, laid open by\r\n  Ethelfrith's conquest at Chester.\r\n\r\n  [4] See _Theodore and Wilfrith_. The same.\r\n\r\nBut when Oswy died (670 or 671) and his son Ecgfrith succeeded, Chad\r\nretired, and Wilfrith was made sole Bishop. Now began a very active\r\nand happy period of his life. Enjoying undivided power, a position\r\nwhich suited his nature, he moved about his huge diocese, everywhere\r\ncreating new foundations and building fresh churches. With skilled\r\nworkmen under him, he was the great architect and builder of his\r\ntime. First he turned his attention to the head church in York, which\r\nhad become, since Oswald's days, ruinous. After building there an\r\nedifice unique in its time, he took his masons to Ripon, and there\r\nhe built a basilica of dressed stone with pillars and arches and\r\nporches. He also enriched its altar with vases, and a vestment of\r\npurple and gold, and laid upon it a book of the Gospels, marvellously\r\nillumined, and enclosed in a gold and jewelled case. Wilfrith made\r\nthe dedication of this church, which was attended by King Ecgfrith,\r\nand by tributary kings, reeves and abbots, an occasion of great\r\nsplendour. Standing before the altar, with his face towards the\r\nconcourse of people, he recited the names of the lands with which\r\nRipon was endowed, as also of certain sanctuaries of the Britons\r\nwhich were taken over by it.\r\n\r\nNow this enumeration of lands, said to be given by princes with the\r\nconsent of the bishops, is of great interest.[5] Were these lands\r\nwithin Alchfrith's former sub-kingdom--the nucleus being his monastic\r\nendowment?--and was it intended to create a bishopric there at Ripon,\r\nseparate from the one at York? Certainly the great tracts of country\r\nmentioned were to be ecclesiastically ruled from Ripon, whether by\r\nabbot or bishop.\r\n\r\n  [5] For the meaning and scope of these early gifts to the church,\r\n  which not only embraced whole villages, but even hundreds and\r\n  provinces, see Maitland's _Doomsday Book and Beyond_, p. 498.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the confused and certainly corrupt list of names that\r\nhas come down to us of Wilfrith's remarkable recitation, several have\r\nbeen localized within that last conquered portion of Northumbria\r\nlying to the west, which may have been called by the Celts who lost\r\nit, Teyrnllwg.[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] See Rhys' _Celtic Britain_ for a suggestion that Edwin's\r\n  conquest and Teyrnllwg may represent a considerable portion of\r\n  our district, also \"Rydal\" in _Westmorland Gazette_, May 2nd,\r\n  1903. Mr. Farrer, while noticing this point in _Victorian History\r\n  of Lancashire_, vol. ii., considers that better authority could\r\n  be desired. For the list of names of gifts to Ripon that have\r\n  come down to us, see Canon Raine's _Historians of the Church of\r\n  York_. Amounderness, between the Ribble and the Cocker, is one.\r\n  Cartmel is probably another. The region \"dunutinga\" may possibly\r\n  be referred to the Duddon and beyond, where still are manor and\r\n  fells called Dunnerdale, and the hamlet of Old Dunning Well and\r\n  Dumerholme. Donya is the name of some explored earthworks at\r\n  the junction of Bannisdale beck with the Mint, north of Kendal.\r\n  \"Goedyne\" suggests \"Gadeni\" or \"Cadeni,\" a name applied to the\r\n  people of the Borders. See Prof. Veitch's _History and Poetry\r\n  of Scottish Borders_. The lands of William de Dunnington are\r\n  mentioned in the _Furness Abbey Coucher Book_, ccviii.\r\n\r\nWhatever had been Alchfrith's intentions about Ripon, Wilfrith's\r\nwere clear in thus making it the church centre for a district as\r\nwide as a diocese. In effect, it was a diocese; though only for a\r\nshort time was there a recognized Bishop of Ripon. And this was after\r\nEcgfrith and Wilfrith had unhappily quarrelled, and Wilfrith had\r\nbeen expelled from Northumbria, when Theodore, the new archbishop,\r\nwho had been called north to re-organize the huge diocese, made\r\nfinally five bishoprics out of it; and Eadhed (after temporarily\r\nruling a see at Lindsey) became, according to Bede, the Bishop of\r\nRipon. But upon the reconciliation of Wilfrith with King Aldfrith,\r\nwho succeeded Ecgfrith, Eadhed retired from Ripon, and Wilfrith again\r\ntook possession of it, and ruled it--though only as abbot--until his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nWilfrith's inauguration of Ripon, which took place in the period\r\nof his sole prelacy of Northumbria (671 to 678) was then an event\r\nof great importance for the district round the great Bay, and for\r\nGrasmere; indeed it is hardly too much to say that its results lasted\r\nover a thousand years. For in spite of the bishop's loss of power,\r\nhis scheme ultimately held good. When the long dark days of Danish\r\nanarchy were passed, the western district which he gathered in to\r\nthe fold of Ripon emerged as an ecclesiastical entity, and it kept\r\nits bounds through the administrative changes of the Norman kings,\r\nwhich carved out of it the barony of Kendal, and made of it parts of\r\nWestmorland, Cumberland, Yorkshire and Lancashire. The archdeaconry\r\nof Richmondshire, which was formally constituted a section of the\r\ndiocese of York in 1090, is in fact almost identical with Wilfrid's\r\nprovince of Ripon. It is true that Ripon ceased to be its centre,\r\nthat establishment sinking again into a monastery, which lay indeed\r\na few miles beyond the boundary of Richmondshire; while a new\r\ncentre was created at Richmond, a little town without significance\r\nstanding in another Yorkshire vale.[7] This great church province\r\nwas ruled over by an archdeacon, who possessed almost the powers of\r\na bishop,[8] until it was transferred by Henry the Eighth in 1541\r\nfrom the diocese of York to that of Chester; and it remained intact\r\nuntil 1847, when it was broken up among what are now the dioceses of\r\nCarlisle, Manchester, and Ripon.[9] Our own part of it became the\r\narchdeaconry of Westmorland, under Carlisle.\r\n\r\n  [7] In 1140 Alan, earl of Richmond is stated to have oppressed\r\n  Ripon; and in 1143 he assaulted Archbishop William by the shrine\r\n  of St. Wilfrith within the church. _Mem. of Ripon._ Surtees\r\n  Society.\r\n\r\n  [8] Wills and inventories of the Archdeaconry of Richmondshire.\r\n\r\n  [9] This did not take effect, however, until after the death of\r\n  Bishop Percy in 1856. _Victoria History of Cumberland._\r\n\r\nAfter Wilfrith had lost favour at the Northumbrian court, and carried\r\nhis grievances to Rome, King Ecgfrith secured the co-operation of\r\nTheodore, archbishop of Canterbury (669) in the organization of\r\nthe Northern Church. As has been said, there are indications that\r\nchurch work went on busily in the district of the great Bay. St.\r\nCuthbert, who had served his apprenticeship as a monk at Ripon, was\r\nmade bishop in 685 and administered his great See from Lindisfarne.\r\nInto his charge Ecgfrith expressly gave Cartmel with its Britons, and\r\nthe newly-conquered district round Carlisle. Carlisle became indeed\r\na thriving church centre, with royal nunnery and monastery, and\r\nwith missions spreading round it. Bede has drawn a striking picture\r\nof the bishop's visit to the ruined Roman city, when a vision of\r\nthe king's overthrow came upon him; as well as of his last meeting\r\nwith St. Herebert, the hermit of Derwentwater, who was wont every\r\nyear to seek his counsel. The district of Cartmel he placed in the\r\ncharge of the \"good Abbot Cineferth,\" as if it were too distant from\r\nLindisfarne for his immediate care. But, while his own easiest route\r\nto Carlisle would be by the straight road along the Roman Wall, he\r\nwould not be ignorant of that other road striking northwards through\r\nthe mountains from the great Bay. He may, indeed, have travelled\r\nthis road himself on his missionary journeys, and even have halted\r\nto preach in the vale of Grasmere. It is certain at least that some\r\nof the holy men working for the Anglo-Scottish Church at this period\r\nmust have done so. With the defeat and death of Ecgfrith the glory\r\nof the Northumbrian kingdom came to an end indeed; but the church\r\ncontinued to prosper; and in the two hundred years between that event\r\nand the final relinquishment of Lindisfarne as a See, on through the\r\nravages of the Danes, it wrought a mighty work, not only in the old\r\nkingdoms of Bernicia and Deira, but in the region westward. Many\r\nof our existing foundations may well date back from that time; and\r\nit is probable that the ruined or entirely vanished chapels of our\r\ndistrict were built in that age of piety.[10] We know from Bede\r\nthat there was a monastery at Dacre in Cumberland, which existed at\r\nleast until 926.[11] It has been suggested that a certain monastery,\r\nfounded by a Northumbrian nobleman in the reign of Osred (slain in\r\n717) was situated at Heversham in Westmorland.[12] Certainly at\r\nHeversham may be seen the fragments of a cross wrought in patterns\r\nsuch as experts ascribe to the Anglian school of workmanship\r\nintroduced by Wilfrith.[13]\r\n\r\n  [10] See \"Lost Churches in the Carlisle Diocese.\" _Transactions_\r\n  Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian Society, vol. xv.\r\n\r\n  [11] See _Victorian History of Cumberland_.\r\n\r\n  [12] See Bates's _History of Northumberland_.\r\n\r\n  [13] See _Sculptured Crosses of the Diocese of Carlisle_.\r\n  Calverley & Collingwood.\r\n\r\nThen too a thrilling event in hagiological history touched our parts\r\nnearly. When the monks of Lindisfarne fled before the ravaging Danes\r\nwith St. Cuthbert's body, they went westward for safety, and their\r\nwanderings brought them into Cumberland and Westmorland.[14] A gap\r\nin their travels which the antiquary has yet failed to trace may\r\npossibly have been filled by a route through Craven--that perpetual\r\nhaunt of refugees--and about Morecambe Bay.\r\n\r\n  [14] See \"Translation of St. Cuthbert.\" _Transactions_ Cumberland\r\n  and Westmorland Antiquarian Society, part 1, vol. ii.\r\n\r\nCertainly a well-used road must have passed not far from our district\r\nin the days of Northumbrian anarchy, when Danish kings and allies\r\nreigned alike at York and at Dublin. Windermere indeed is associated\r\nwith the murder (741) of two young princes of the royal house.[15]\r\n\r\n  [15] See D. F. Hodgkin's _History of Northumberland_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEDICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the question so often asked, When was the church of Grasmere\r\nfounded? no more than a conjectural answer can be given. The district\r\nformed part--though a remote one--of Northumbria, and doubtless\r\nshared in the conversion of that kingdom. Even before that time it\r\nmay have been touched by those successive missionary efforts, which\r\nhave been happily classed as the Romano-British of Ninian at the end\r\nof the fourth century, the Irish of Patrick in the fifth century,\r\nand the Kymric of Kentigern in the sixth; and these efforts were\r\nfollowed up by the steady work of the Anglo-Scottish monks, and the\r\nestablishment under the Anglian kings of an organized church.[16]\r\n\r\n  [16] See \"Lost Churches in Carlisle Diocese,\" _Transactions_\r\n  Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian Society, vol. XV.\r\n\r\nThe dedication of the Grasmere church favours the supposition that\r\nits foundation was early. Its name-saint is King Oswald, who planted\r\na cross as a standard in the battle by which he gained Northumbria,\r\nand who was killed at Maserfeld by the heathen Penda in 642. He\r\nbecame the idol of the Northumbrian christians, and his relics were\r\ncherished in many a shrine. When danger threatened Lindisfarne, his\r\nhead was placed for safety in the coffin of St. Cuthbert;[17] and\r\nwith this sacred burden the monks, as stated above, fled westward,\r\nwandering for years in parts adjacent to Westmorland, if they did not\r\nactually cross its borders.\r\n\r\n  [17] Where it is still, with the mark of a cut from sword or\r\n  battle-axe plain to see.--ED.\r\n\r\nA well in the Grasmere valley shared the dedication with the church,\r\nand indeed may have been antecedent to it, as a place of resort.\r\nIt is at the foot of Kelbarrow (formerly Kelbergh,[18] the hill\r\nof the spring); and the Celts were wont to decorate their _kels_\r\nor springs with votive offerings of a heathen kind. The church,\r\nhowever, always took care to possess herself of such wells, absorbing\r\nany sanctification that was ascribed to them; and the water of St.\r\nOswald's well continued to be carried to the church for baptisms\r\nuntil quite recent times.[19]\r\n\r\n  [18] Monkbergh by Windermere has become Mountbarrow.\r\n\r\n  [19] The spot was pointed out to Mrs. Simpson by the Rev. Edward\r\n  Jefferies, who from 1840 was curate in charge.\r\n\r\nChurch and well are not, however, close together. The well springs in\r\nthe flat meadow between the path to the Wray and Wray Beck, but it\r\nis now covered in. The adjacent bay of the lake is called Well-foot,\r\nand the bridge over the beck has the same name; and when the Wray\r\nproperty was \"boundered\" in 1683, the \"welfoot bridge\" was spoken of.\r\n\r\nIt is suggestive that the farmstead close by owns the name of\r\nPavement End, being formerly known as Padmire. Could it be proved\r\nthat the name is an ancient one, the idea that the spot was much\r\nresorted to of old would be confirmed, since the causeway went so far\r\nand no farther.[20]\r\n\r\n  [20] I find, however, in deeds of the early seventeenth century,\r\n  only _Padman_ hereabouts. Or is this a mistake for Padmar? Padman\r\n  appears in the register.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SITE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present site of the church may not have been the original one. It\r\nis hardly a likely halting-place for a travelling preacher. The Roman\r\nroad which traversed the valley could neither have been the present\r\none, that leads to church and village, nor the straight cut from Town\r\nEnd that passes the Swan Inn. Both of these cross the flat bottom;\r\nand the Romans from the summit of White Moss (by which they certainly\r\nentered the vale) would never have dropped into the marsh below (even\r\nnow water-logged in places), only to climb out again, to that gap\r\nof the Raise that plainly beckoned them to their goal northward.\r\nInstead, they would maintain their level as far as might be, and\r\nkeep along the firm slope of the fells at a height of some 300 to\r\n400 feet; then, with only two rapid becks to ford, they would come\r\neasily and gradually to the ascent of the pass. It is interesting to\r\nfind that along this presumed route there exists a line of scattered\r\nhomesteads; while the modern road below was--until the recent spurt\r\nin building, vacant but for a cottage and the Swan Inn; and this last\r\nstands in reality on an ancient cross \"loaning\" between the higher\r\nroad suggested, and the village. Many of these homesteads have been\r\nturned into houses for the wealthy, and great alterations have taken\r\nplace; but a track the whole way may still be made out, though hidden\r\nin places by private drives and occupation roads. From White Moss it\r\ndropped but little at first, passing behind the highest of the modern\r\nhouses, according to the belief of old people, who say that this\r\nsection of it, though remembered, was stopped up before their time.\r\nIt touched How Head, a farmhold now deserted; then the Hollins,\r\nForest Side, Ben Place and Beck Houses. It crossed Greenhead Gill and\r\npassed behind Knott Houses, Winterseeds and Gillside, continuing by\r\nthe present ford over Tongue Gill, whence the pass is soon gained.\r\n\r\nNow of these names many represented of old not one house, but a\r\ncouple or even a group. Doubtless most of them were planted by the\r\nNorse settlers either upon or below the Roman road, on some spot\r\nconveniently above their meadows and common field; and devious lanes\r\nwould in time become trodden between one and another, to the final\r\ndiscarding of the old straight track. Still this can be traced in\r\nplaces; and a bit to be seen above Winterseeds is probably the actual\r\nRoman road. A stone celt was recently found in the beck close below\r\nit. A quern was also found not far off.[21] The fact that a smithy\r\nexisted until recently at Winterseeds--which is only reached now by\r\nclimbing the steep brow from the main road--is strong presumptive\r\nevidence of an old line of traffic passing by it. There the last\r\nof the smiths, John Watson, made the ironwork of the present outer\r\nchurch-door. When he became old, a smithy was set up on the lower\r\nroad, at Tongue Gill.\r\n\r\n  [21] See _Transactions_ Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian\r\n  Society, N.S. 3, p. 419.\r\n\r\nNow it is a singular fact that a field lying a little below this\r\nroad, near the gateway of Forrest Side, bears the name of Kirk How.\r\nAnd there is a tradition attached to the spot. It is said that the\r\nchurch of the valley was to have been built here, and that the\r\nmaterials were even gathered together ready for the start; when lo!\r\nthey vanished in the night-time, only to be found upon the present\r\nsite, and that a second attempt only produced a like result, the\r\ninference being conveyed, by sly looks and chuckles on the part of\r\nthe narrator, that the task had been wrought by some supernatural\r\nBeing, not to be lightly mentioned. Whether this was the Hob, or\r\nHobthrush who played so large a part in the stories of the past,\r\ncannot be said, but the legend, in its humorous fearlessness, and\r\nlove of a practical joke, is characteristic of the dalesman,[22]\r\nand coupled with the name of the field it is suggestive. It seems\r\npossible that here, at a spot where a traveller upon the road might\r\nso conveniently halt and set up his cross and portable altar, an\r\nearly rude (perhaps timbered) structure may actually have once stood.\r\nA well, too, for baptism was not far off. There is one in the grounds\r\nof the Hollins whose water has remained in repute, and which was\r\nexamined by an expert at the time (1843) when an effort was made to\r\nestablish a hydropathic cure in Grasmere.[23] The water was then\r\npronounced finer than that of St. Oswald's Well; but as the owner of\r\nthe land would not sell, the establishment was placed at the Wray,\r\nclose to St. Oswald's. The enterprise, started by Mr. Phillips,\r\nand conducted by a resident doctor and a German bathman, was not\r\nsuccessful, and was given up in five or six years. If the well at the\r\nHollins ever had a name, it is now unknown.\r\n\r\n  [22] The same legend is attached to three Lancashire churches,\r\n  the foundations of which date back to Saxon times. One is St.\r\n  Oswald's, Winwick, where the saint's well was once a place of\r\n  resort. Tradition has preserved, in the case of St. Chad's,\r\n  Rochdale, some particulars of the elfish rabble who wrought the\r\n  change. See _Memorials of Old Lancashire_, vol. --, p. 91-92.\r\n\r\n  [23] From Edward Wilson, parish verger till November, 1906.\r\n  His father, a joiner like himself, did the woodwork for the\r\n  hydropathic establishment.\r\n\r\nIt is hard not to let conjecture play round this tradition of a\r\nchange of site. Might it not actually have been made? Could it be\r\nconnected with the turning of Grasmere into a manor, and with the\r\nparcelling out of a demesne in the valley? The barons of Kendal,\r\nof whom Ivo de Talbois was the first, possessed all these parts,\r\nfrom the time of Henry I. He and his successors governed by feudal\r\nmethods, through agents. There was here no intermediary lord between\r\nbaron and vassal; and the baron's officers--his bailiffs and his\r\nforesters--would be placed in secure houses or fenced lodges, whence\r\nthey would control and govern. A demesne of Grasmere is mentioned on\r\nthe death of William de Lindesay, 1233, and a manor and park in a\r\ncharter of 1297.[24] The woods sold by Henry the Eighth in 1544 were\r\nthe residue of the lord's forest; he being the inheritor of the Fee.\r\n\r\n  [24] Inquisition post mortem. _Calendar Patent Rolls_, 25 Edward\r\n  I.\r\n\r\nNow we may reasonably suppose this demesne to have been planted in\r\nKirktown, as the present village came to be called, where the meadows\r\nwere rich and the soil deep for ploughing, but distant from, and\r\nbelow the ancient line of road with its scattered homesteads. The\r\ndemesne made a village nucleus; for all the accessories of a manor\r\nhouse would spring up about it. We know the lord's brewery was not\r\nfar off, at Kelbergh, where springs--beside the holy one--are still\r\nabundant.[25] In a rental, dated 1375[26] that concerned the part of\r\nGrasmere then held by the Hotham and Pedwardyn families, it is stated\r\nthat \"Richard Smyth holds the forge and should render 12d and 1d,\"\r\nwith the addition that he pays 2s 0d per annum for \"Kelebergh.\" From\r\nanother document we learn that certain tenants of Grasmere pay an\r\nunspecified sum for the brewery of Keldbergh.\r\n\r\n  [25] The modern house built upon the knoll had a well within\r\n  it, and behind the house--where a hidden runner gushes out by a\r\n  rock--there are traces of old pavement.\r\n\r\n  [26] Levens Hall MSS.\r\n\r\nThis manorial centre was united to the high line of road on the other\r\nside of the valley by several ways. One, a footpath, still passes\r\nhard by Kirk How, a now disused smithy being upon it. Two others\r\napproach and meet to cross Raise Beck together by White Bridge, the\r\nname indicative of a stone fabric at a time when timber was commoner.\r\nHere the village pinfold still stands.\r\n\r\nWhat more natural than that the church should be added to this\r\ncentral group, and at a time perhaps when enlarged space and entire\r\nrebuilding of an existing edifice required to be done? The site by\r\nthe river would afford deep soil for burial. To such a change of site\r\n(supposing it were made) there would naturally be opposition from\r\nsome quarter; whence the tradition.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is but conjecture. The fabric of the present church\r\nshows no feature that is of a certainty older than the introduction\r\nof manorial rule into Grasmere; while it may be as late as the\r\nfourteenth century. But before considering the question of its age,\r\nit will be well to point out other evidences of the existence of a\r\nchurch in the valley before record began, and then pass on to such\r\nscant records as time has left to us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Date]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The PARISH of GRASMERE its Townships and Churches]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE PARISH\r\n\r\nBOUNDARIES\r\n\r\nTHE TOWNSHIPS\r\n\r\nLEGAL ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTEEN\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARISH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe church of Grasmere is found when record begins, serving as the\r\ncentre of a large and regularly constituted parish. The date of\r\nthe creation of this parish is not known; but from the fact that\r\nits southern boundary runs by the Stock Beck--thus cutting the now\r\nthriving town of Ambleside into two parts, one of which belonged to\r\nGrasmere and the other to Windermere--there seems a probability of it\r\nhaving been delineated at an early period, when the _sæter_ of some\r\nNorse settler was but an insignificant clearing in the forest.\r\n\r\nEvery parish is but a unit in a complex Church organization, which\r\npasses upwards by rural deanery, archdeaconry, to diocese. In\r\nhistorical evolution, there is a descent from the greater to the\r\nless; while each successive ecclesiastical demarcation followed as\r\na rule some political line of kingdom or state. The diocese for\r\ninstance was conterminous with the Anglo-Saxon kingdom; the parish\r\nrepresented the township, or the manor.\r\n\r\nBut in the vast kingdom of Northumbria the superposition of church\r\nboundaries upon state boundaries was not so simple a matter, and\r\nthe subdivisions that took place are not easy to trace. Archbishop\r\nTheodore, when called in by King Egfrith (678) to portion his kingdom\r\nfor purposes of church rule, made at least three bishoprics out of\r\nthe one whose centre--after a removal to Lindisfarne--was fixed at\r\nYork.[27]\r\n\r\n  [27] Bright's _Early Church History_, p. 291. Bishop Browne's\r\n  _Theodore and Wilfrith_, pp. 132 and 690.\r\n\r\nNext, the archdeaconries were marked out under Thomas, Archbishop\r\nof York, some time between 1070 and 1100. The archdeaconry of\r\nRichmondshire, lying in the mountainous region west of the old\r\nAnglian kingdom, was a great and peculiar province, and the\r\narchdeacon ruled over it with almost the powers of a bishop.[28]\r\n\r\n  [28] It may possibly represent an old sub-kingdom of Northumbria,\r\n  and is suggestive of Edwin's conquest of a district to the\r\n  north-west called by the Britons Teyrnllwg. See Rhys's _Celtic\r\n  Britain_ (quoted in \"Rydal,\" _Westmorland Gazette_, May 2nd,\r\n  1903). It contained large portions at least of that great church\r\n  province which Wilfrid made over to Ripon Minster, which was for\r\n  a short time the seat of a bishop. The creation of Richmond as a\r\n  centre was a late Norman measure.\r\n\r\nThe archdeaconry was divided again into rural deaneries, of which\r\nKendal was one. This deanery embraced ten parishes, Grasmere being\r\nthe westermost of them. It appears singular that this group of ten\r\nparishes lay in three different counties,--Yorkshire, Lancashire, and\r\nWestmorland; and from this circumstance it has been argued that here\r\n(as in our own parish) the ecclesiastical division was made prior to\r\nthe political one of counties. This probably was so; and it is clear\r\nthat the deanery represents in reality another political area, viz.:\r\nthat of the barony of Kendal created by William Rufus.[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] Whitaker's _History of Richmondshire_. Dr. Wilson\r\n  (_Victorian History of Cumberland_) gives 1120 to 1130 as dates\r\n  between which Henry I. marked out the county divisions as fiscal\r\n  areas. In the latter year the new county of Westmarieland was\r\n  placed under the jurisdiction of a separate sheriff.\r\n\r\nKirkby Kendale, the _caput_ of the barony, became from this period\r\nthe official church centre. There the Synods and Archidiaconal Courts\r\nwere held, and all dues were paid which the higher church authorities\r\nexacted from the parishes--Grasmere among them.[30] Thither the\r\nrector or his substitute, along with the churchwardens, annually\r\nrepaired.\r\n\r\n  [30] For the connection between mother churches and chapelries\r\n  or vicarages under them, see _History of English Church_, edited\r\n  by Dean Stephens, vol. ii., p. 295. [\"Walter Gray, Archbishop\r\n  of York in 1233 consolidated 10 chapelries in the two parishes\r\n  of Pocklington and Pickering into five vicarages, two and two.\r\n  Each vicar had two chapels, and was endowed with a sum to support\r\n  chaplains at both, while he also paid a small sum annually to the\r\n  mother church in token of subjection.\"] From the rural deanery of\r\n  Kendal there were paid the following dues, according to an old\r\n  voucher, c. 1320: at Easter 12s. 0d. for Synodalia; at Michaelmas\r\n  £4 16s 8d for Procurationes; besides £3 for Presumptiones, and £3\r\n  9s 6d in Peter's pence--a goodly tribute this for the Pope from\r\n  our mountains lands! Whitaker's _History of Richmondshire_.\r\n\r\nThe exact relationship between the central church at Kirkby and the\r\nchurches of Grasmere and Windermere in early days is hard to make\r\nout. They were considered in some sort as dependencies, and were\r\ncalled chapels after they had become parish churches. This uncertain\r\nposition recalls the constitution of the early British church. And\r\nit must be remembered that Theodore's _parochia_ was not a parish\r\nbut a diocese. Again, the laws of Edgar (959-975) place churches in\r\nthree classes: first, the ancient church or monastery of a district;\r\nsecond, the church with a corpse-ground; and third, the church\r\nwithout a corpse-ground.[31] Tithes moreover were enjoined to be paid\r\nto the ancient or central church.\r\n\r\n  [31] Selden's _History of Tithes_. Easterby's _Law of Tithes_,\r\n  pp. 4, 8, and 13.\r\n\r\nNow Grasmere may at first have ranked in the third order, as a\r\nmission church (_capella_). It would in that case pay its tithes,\r\nor a large proportion of them, to Kirkby Kendal, and bury its\r\nchristian dead within the consecrated soil of that church. It may not\r\nhave acquired the right of burial until the lord created a demesne\r\nthere.[32] This view is strengthened by the fact that the church of\r\nKendale claimed certain dues from Grasmere and Windermere down to\r\na late date. One was a pension of 13s. 4d. (one mark) paid to the\r\nvicar out of the tithes of the parish. The other was a mortuary fee,\r\nexacted by him as late as the seventeenth century.[33]\r\n\r\n  [32] The early practice of burial in distant churches is\r\n  inexplicable to this age. But it should be remembered that in\r\n  early days man was a peripatetic animal, to whom the distance\r\n  between Grasmere and Kendal, or Hawkshead and Dalton, would be\r\n  slight; and that a corpse wrapped in a winding-sheet would be\r\n  much lighter than one coffined.\r\n\r\n  [33] Of the first, still paid, there is plenty of evidence. It\r\n  was even allowed during the Commonwealth. In 1645 the Rydal\r\n  Hall account-sheets show that arrears were paid to the Kendal\r\n  parson out of the tithes \"upon order for 5 yeares stypd out of\r\n  Gresmire,\" amounting to £3 6s 8d or five marks. Next year is\r\n  entered \"Rent due to mr. M. out of Gresmire tithes\" 13s 6d. The\r\n  order came from the Puritan Committee at Kendal.\r\n\r\n  A mortuary, or corpse present, was distinct from a burial fee,\r\n  and was supposed to cover any obligation forgotten by the dead\r\n  man to church or priest. The claim anciently was upon his second\r\n  best animal, the best going to his feudal lord; but it came to be\r\n  paid in coin; while a law was passed (21 Henry VIII.) limiting\r\n  the sum to 10s., and that only when the deceased owned goods to\r\n  the value of £40. Dr. Cox, _Parish Registers of England_. The\r\n  following receipt is in existence for a fee paid to Kendal on the\r\n  death of Edward Walker of Rydal, who was buried in his parish\r\n  church of Grasmere:--\r\n\r\n  \"Jan; the 2nd Anno Domj 1652.\r\n\r\n  Rec. p. fr ye Executors of Edward Walker ye Sume of ffive\r\n  shillings in full satisfaction of a Mortuary due to ye Vicar\r\n  of Kendall by me Tho: Willain I say received the day and yeare\r\n  abouesd by me Tho: Willain ye aforesd sume of 5s 0d.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUNDARIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boundary of the parish of Grasmere followed geographical lines.\r\nStarting from the point where the Rothay and the Brathay unite for\r\ntheir entrance into Windermere, it ascended the first river for a\r\nshort distance until it reached the tributary, Stock beck. This it\r\nascended until, near the source, it struck upwards to the line of\r\nthe watershed. It then followed a devious course along the mountain\r\ntops, as \"heven watter deales\" (divides), according to the quaint\r\nold boundary phrase. Always clinging to the sky line between waters\r\nflowing north and south, it dropped to Dunmail Raise, to rise to\r\nthe tops again. From these lonely heights it made another short\r\nartificial course to reach Little Langdale beck near the source, and\r\nwith these waters--named Brathay after emerging from Elterwater--it\r\ncontinued to the uniting place of the two rivers at Bird-house Mouth.\r\nThus, with the exception of the right bank of the Brathay, the parish\r\nembraced the whole area of the two valleys of the Rothay and Brathay\r\nand their confluents. Its boundary marched with that of parishes\r\nin Westmorland, Cumberland and Lancashire. Its northern line was\r\nfor centuries the boundary between the Anglian rule, and the Celtic\r\nkingdom of Cumbria. Its circuit counted some thirty-five miles by\r\nflat measurement; but much of it lay on summits that reach to a great\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOWNSHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis parish--a wild tract of fells, becks, and tarns, was divided\r\ninto three component parts.\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out[34] that the ancient church of Northumbria\r\nleft certain marks upon the districts she administered which\r\nmay yet be distinguished. One peculiarity was the great extent\r\nof the parishes, some of which embraced several--occasionally\r\nmany--townships. Another was, that each parish was governed secularly\r\nby a body of men known as the Twenty-four. Now Grasmere conformed\r\nnearly, though not exactly, with these rules; for the controlling\r\nbody consisted of Eighteen, not Twenty-four, being in this respect\r\nlike the Cumbrian parish of Crosthwaite to the north. But other\r\nparishes of the district had their Twenty-four--as Cartmel and Dalton\r\nin Furness.[35] In the next parish of Windermere, the Twenty-four are\r\nstill an active body, and collect at the church every Easter Tuesday,\r\neight coming from each of the three townships, Under-Milbeck,\r\nApplethwaite and Troutbeck.\r\n\r\n  [34] Creighton's _Historical Essays_.\r\n\r\n  [35] At Cartmel in 1642 measures were taken \"for the makinge\r\n  upp of the twentie-fourte ... that there may be four in everye\r\n  churchwardens division as hath formerlie been used.\" Stockdale's\r\n  _Annales Caermoelensis_.\r\n\r\nThe parish of Grasmere also embraced three townships. One was\r\nGrasmere proper, situated in the basin-shaped vale that catches\r\nthe sources of the Rothay, Langdale; the sister valley formed\r\nthe second township, which extended to Elterwater; the third was\r\nRydal-and-Loughrigg (often called Loughrigg and Beneath-Moss) which\r\nincluded all the rocky mass between the converging rivers, the\r\ncompact village of Rydal with part of Ambleside.\r\n\r\nFrom three sides of the parish then, by mountain path and\r\n\"horse-trod,\" the folk wended their way for worship to Grasmere\r\nChurch. Those of the vale of Grasmere proper would gather in units or\r\nlittle groups from all the scattered farmsteads, from Far Easdale and\r\nBlindtarn Gill, from Town Head, Gill Side, and all the houses that\r\nlay \"Aboon Beck\" as far as How Head and Town End, till they met at\r\ntheir lych-gate on the north side of the church.\r\n\r\nFrom Loughrigg and Beneath-Moss they would collect by many a devious\r\ntrack, starting as far back as Clappersgate and Ambleside. From\r\nAmbleside ancient \"trods\" passed Nook End, and rose from Scandale\r\nBridge by easy grade to Nab Lane (where Rydal folk would join them)\r\nand White Moss, and thence descending to cross the church bridge to\r\nenter the garth by the present gate, which was specially their own.\r\n\r\nThe third stream of worshippers flowed from the farthest sources\r\nwest, from the recesses of Little Langdale, from Blea Tarn, and\r\nFell Foot, from Forge and Hackett and Colwith they came, on through\r\nElterwater, and across Walthwaite Bottom. Mounting the brow, they\r\nwould meet a tributary stream of fellow-townsfolk, that gathered\r\nright from Steel End and Wall End, increasing as it flowed down\r\nMickle Langdale, till it crossed the ridge of Hunting Stile. Dropping\r\nsteeply into the vale, they would at Nichols (where stood an inn)\r\nmeet a third contingent (from Loughrigg) which, starting at Skelwith,\r\nmounted by Foul Step to Little Loughrigg, passed by the Fold, the\r\nOaks and Scroggs, to descend by Red Bank to the level of Grasmere\r\nLake.[36] From Nichols onward the united groups would travel by the\r\nlake, and past the Holy Well, to enter the church garth by a gate\r\nat the north-west angle, now gone, called the Langdale gate.[37]\r\nHere, at Church Stile, stood an important inn, long owned by the\r\nHarrison family. Shelter and a fire must indeed have been often\r\nneeded (as well as something for the inner man) after the long\r\ntravel--especially at funeral gatherings, when the corpse had to be\r\nborne through ford and flood, or through the storms and deep snows\r\nof winter time. The Ambleside folk, when in 1674 they petitioned\r\ntheir bishop for the right of burial in their chapel, stated that\r\n\"by reason of the heat in summer and the great snowes and sudden\r\ninundations of water in winter it is very difficult and dangerous to\r\ncarry their dead thither [to Grasmere] for burial\";[38] yet their\r\ndistance from the church was nothing like that of the Langdale\r\nfolk. There were not infrequent burials from the right bank of Little\r\nLangdale beck, in the parish of Hawkshead or of \"Ulverston.\"\r\n\r\n  [36] There is a tradition that a route from Skelwith Bridge\r\n  dropped sharply from the top of Red Bank to the old ford of the\r\n  Rothay known as Bathwath (Rydal Hall MSS.), and that it had even\r\n  been used for funerals. This seems unlikely, unless the use were\r\n  a repetition of a custom that had prevailed before the present\r\n  Red Bank road was made; and of superstitious adherence to old\r\n  corpse-roads the Rev. J. C. Atkinson (_Forty Years in a Moorland\r\n  Parish_) gives instances. There may indeed have been once a\r\n  well-trodden path there. In former times a fulling-mill stood on\r\n  the left bank of the Rothay, near to the ford, and within the\r\n  freehold property of Bainrigg. The mill was owned by the Benson\r\n  family in the fifteenth century, but Bainrigg had belonged before\r\n  that time to a family of de Bainbrigg, who had at least one\r\n  capital dwelling or mansion-house standing upon it. Now a road to\r\n  this house or houses there must have been. The woodman recently\r\n  found a track leading up from the site of the mill to the rocky\r\n  height, which emerged upon the present Wishing-Gate road. On the\r\n  line of this (which was engineered as a turnpike road only about\r\n  1770-80) the older way doubtless continued towards Grasmere,\r\n  past How Top and through Town End. A huge stone standing on this\r\n  line was known as the How Stone. Levi Hodgson who lived at How\r\n  Top, and who described the route to Mr. W. H. Hills, remembered\r\n  fragments of a cottage in the wood. If the Skelwith Bridge folk\r\n  ever used it as a church path, they would meet their townsmen\r\n  (who had come over White Moss) at How Top. Close by there is\r\n  still a flat-topped boulder used for resting burdens upon.\r\n\r\n  [37] This gate is shown in a map of 1846, as well as the stile\r\n  which gave its name to the house then still standing, that was\r\n  immediately opposite. Both disappeared at the widening of the\r\n  lane from Stock Bridge to the church.\r\n\r\n  [38] Ambleside Town and Chapel.\r\n\r\nOnce within the churchyard, the different streams of the townships\r\nmingled as fellow parishioners. The sexes however, divided, the women\r\nseeking entrance (presumably) by the great south porch, and the men\r\n(after business done) herding in by the west door, known as theirs.\r\nYet once inside, they again fell rigorously into ranks of townships,\r\nas we shall see.\r\n\r\nThe gathering of the dalesfolk for worship must have been a striking\r\nsight, especially on the great feast days when--four times in the\r\nyear--the sacraments were administered. Certainly attendance at\r\nchurch was obligatory upon every Sabbath Day, and fines were levied\r\nfor default. But from the early seventeenth century, if not before,\r\nthe dependent chapels in Langdale (at Chapel Stile) and Ambleside\r\nwould absorb many of the more distant worshippers. For the four\r\ngreat celebrations, however, the whole of the adult population of\r\nthe valleys, except the sick and infirm, would attend the parish\r\nchurch.[39] It is of course impossible to compute the number of the\r\npeople, especially in early times; but if we accept the statement\r\nmade in the Presentment of 1712, that there were then about 200\r\nfamilies in the parish, it may be reckoned that at that time and\r\nfor at least a century previously, no fewer than from 500 to 700\r\ncommunicants would gather for the rite. Besides the master and\r\nmistress of the homestead, there were grown-up sons and daughters,\r\nwith farm servants.[40] The garth would be crowded with the concourse\r\nof folk; and when they trooped into the fane, each township to its\r\nown quarter of the building, where men and women again divided to\r\ntake their accustomed places upon their separate forms, and the dogs\r\nsneaked in, hoping to escape the dogwhipper's eye as they settled\r\nunder their masters' legs, the whole space must have been packed.\r\n\r\n  [39] It is not easy to discover what was the early practice of\r\n  the church concerning the administration of the sacrament, or the\r\n  number of times it was received yearly by the laity. As early\r\n  as 750, laymen who failed to communicate at Christmas, Easter,\r\n  and Pentecost, were not esteemed christians; they were expected\r\n  to make offerings four times a year. A later rule, which was\r\n  stringent, seems to have been once a year, though a more frequent\r\n  attendance--specially at Easter and Christmas, was urged. See\r\n  Abbot Gasquet's _Parish Life in Medieval England_, Wall's _Old\r\n  English Parishes_, p. 90, and Wordsworth's _Medieval Services\r\n  in England_. The sacrament was called _housel_, and the bread\r\n  _houselling-bread_. Henry VII's queen, Elizabeth of York, appears\r\n  to have communicated three times a year, at the festivals of\r\n  Easter, All Saints, and Christmas (Canon Simmon's _Notes to the\r\n  Lay Folks' Mass Book_, p. 239). Queen Victoria no doubt clung to\r\n  an old custom when she communicated no oftener than three or four\r\n  times a year. (See _Life_.)\r\n\r\n  [40] The population must have been greater when the Kendal trade\r\n  in cloth was at its height. There were 1300 \"houseling people\"\r\n  reported for the parish of Windermere in 1549 (Commission quoted\r\n  in Mr. Brydson's _Sidelights on Mediæval Windermere_, p. 95),\r\n  and there is no reason to suppose that Grasmere was far behind.\r\n  At the same time the numbers to collect at one celebration would\r\n  be considerably lessened if the Easter communion were spread\r\n  over several occasions, as was the case in the late seventeenth\r\n  century at Clayworth, Notts, where celebrations were held on Palm\r\n  Sunday, Good Friday, as well as Easter Day. All parishioners--to\r\n  judge from the rector's careful record--must at this season have\r\n  communicated; but at the celebrations of Whitweek and Christmas\r\n  (for there was none at Michaelmas) the numbers were much lower.\r\n  (_Rector's Book of Clayworth_).\r\n\r\nThe old, narrow close-set forms seated far more people than the\r\nmodern benches, but even they could not have accommodated the crowds\r\nthat attended certain funerals. (See Charities.) At Mrs. Fleming's\r\nfuneral, for instance, few short of 2000 persons must have been\r\npresent, including dole-getters, neighbours and relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME LEGAL ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThus for worship did the folk gather in the church. They came thither\r\nalso to bury their dead within consecrated soil--for baptism of their\r\n\"barnes\" by the priest, and the binding of man and woman in holy\r\nmatrimony. But the edifice and the enclosed space about it served in\r\nearly times not only for purposes of religion, but of the law. Like\r\nthe Roman Forum, it was used for the transaction of public business\r\nand the administration of justice. Bargains were ratified, covenants\r\nwere witnessed, and protestations made solemn by an oath taken\r\nupon the Holy Gospel where it lay upon the altar--once a wonderful\r\nscript illuminated and jewelled, that is now represented by the\r\ndirty little Testament of the Law Courts. Manor Courts and legal\r\nenquiries or inquests were frequently held within it. Public notices\r\nthat concerned the townships--private ones even of auctions and the\r\nlike--were proclaimed before the assembled people in the garth or the\r\nporch, if not in the building itself. Punishments for moral offences\r\nwere carried out in face of the congregation.[41]\r\n\r\n  [41] We have no evidence of this to show for Grasmere Church. But\r\n  in 1622 \"Sir\" Richard Pearson, curate of Troutbeck, was empowered\r\n  by the rector of Windermere to publicly revoke the sentence of\r\n  excommunication under which one Adam Birkhead lay. An edict was\r\n  issued from the registry of the Archdeaconry of Richmondshire\r\n  as late as 1715, citing a form of penance to be gone through by\r\n  George Birkett, who before the congregation of Troutbeck, and in\r\n  \"penitential habit,\" was to confess his grievous sin of incest\r\n  with his deceased wife's sister. An additional note, however,\r\n  empowered Mr. Barton, rector of Windermere, and Mr. Grisedale,\r\n  curate, to use their discretion as to the manner of confession,\r\n  and to allow the sinner, if properly penitent, to make it \"in his\r\n  Ordinary apparell\" (Browne MSS.). It may have been the dislike\r\n  of public penance, with its peculiar habit, that caused the\r\n  churchwardens of Grasmere so often, and so incorrectly, to return\r\n  a clean bill of morality in their Presentments.\r\n\r\nThe priests and the clergy acted as legal agents for the unlettered\r\nfolk till comparatively recent times. They were versed in the\r\nintricacies of law, as well as ritual, and skilled in penmanship and\r\nthe Latin tongue. The higher of them are found acting as agents and\r\naccountants for the holders of the fees into which the barony became\r\nsplit, as documents which concern our parish show.\r\n\r\nFrequently the chaplain or the village priest drew up indentures,\r\npetitions, and secular agreements for the living, as well as the\r\ntestaments of the dying. Wills were proved at the church registry\r\nof the diocese, and were stored there. The wills of the parish\r\nof Grasmere went to the town of Richmond, the centre of the\r\narchdeaconry; and not until 1719 were they proved at the secular\r\ncourts of Kendal and Lancaster.[42]\r\n\r\n  [42] _Wills and Inventories of the Archdeaconry of Richmondshire_\r\n  (Rev. J. Raine). The privilege of probate was withdrawn finally\r\n  from ecclesiastical courts by Act of 1857 (Dr. Cox's _History of\r\n  Parish Registers_).\r\n\r\nInstances of the use of the church fabric for secular purposes in\r\nthe neighbourhood may be quoted. A Court Roll of 1443 is headed\r\n\"Court of Wynandremere held at the church of Wynandremere 9 July 21\r\nHenry VI.\"[43] An award concerning a private dispute in 1534 between\r\nGeorge Browne of Troutbeck and Myles Dickson of Applethwaite decrees\r\nthat the former pay to the latter \"upon the secunde sonday in lente\r\nnext comynge O-XLs of able ynglyshe money upon or. layde Alter in\r\nWyndandermer church betwixe VIII of the clock and XII of the said\r\nsonday.\"[44] Again, an indenture made 1571 between Mr. John Benson\r\nand his Baisbrowne tenants stipulates that the payment of certain\r\nmoneys should be made \"in langdaill chappell betweene thoures of\r\neyght of the clock at aftr. noine\" on the 1st of August in the two\r\nensuing years.[45] In 1601, when Widow Agnes Fleming of Rydal Hall\r\nwith her sons sued a Penrith man for debt, the commissioners sat and\r\nexamined witnesses in Ambleside Chapel.[46] And within this building\r\nwere probably taken down depositions in several other cases.\r\n\r\n  [43] Public Record Office Court Roll 207/122.\r\n\r\n  [44] Browne MSS.\r\n\r\n  [45] Rydal Hall MSS.\r\n\r\n  [46] Rydal Hall MSS.\r\n\r\nAs regards Grasmere itself record is scant. The manorial courts were\r\noccasionally held in the Moot Hall of Kirkby Kendal, as in 1603,[47]\r\nbut in early times it would be impossible to summon the holders from\r\nso far; and it is stated in 1436 that two courts were yearly held in\r\nGrasmere.[48] No other building than the church could have contained\r\nthis official gathering. The judgment on the 1583 tithe dispute\r\nenjoined that the parishioners were to pay their tithe of lambs in\r\nmoney every Easter \"in the parish church of Gresmier.\" The church or\r\nchapel was as a rule the schoolroom where the priest taught.\r\n\r\n  [47] Public Record Office Court Roll 207/111.\r\n\r\n  [48] Church inquisition post mortem, Henry VI., No. 36.\r\n\r\nThe churchyard, even more than the church itself, had its secular\r\nand popular uses, which came down from ancient time. The fairs, the\r\nmarkets, the sports and the wrestlings[49] which took place within\r\nits enclosing walls, and of which we obtain faint intimations, were\r\nbut the survival of the festivals sanctioned by the early church,\r\nwhen the wake, or fair of the patron saint was kept. This again,\r\nwith its bull-baiting, its rude sports and its temporary stalls,\r\nmay be linked on to the earlier rites of heathen times, when beasts\r\nwere brought to the Temple for sacrifice, and when the people built\r\nbooths about it, in which to hold a three days' feast. The annual\r\nor biennial fair, and even the Sunday market, were quite usual in\r\nthe churchyard, before the boroughs obtained a special privilege for\r\nthem. And though an express statute in 1285 forbade the practice,\r\nneither this nor the later injunction of the Church were heeded. In\r\n1300 the town of Cockermouth complained that its market was spoilt by\r\nthe bartering carried on at Crosthwaite Church, where not only flesh\r\nand fish were sold at festivals (and this distinctly smacks of an\r\nancient sacrificial practice); but that corn, linen, cloth and other\r\ncommodities were conveyed thither every Sunday for barter. In 1380\r\nthe town of Appleby was suffering from a like cause. Merchants were\r\ncarrying their goods to sell in the churchyards of the surrounding\r\ndistrict on Sundays, to the detriment of the accredited market.[50]\r\nIf this was done in other places of the district, it was certainly\r\ndone at Grasmere, for the market town of Kendal was sixteen miles\r\ndistant on a road often impassable.[51]\r\n\r\n  [49] See Coulton's _Chaucer and his England_, where miracle-plays\r\n  and dances are added to the list.\r\n\r\n  [50] Calendar Patent Rolls, 4 Richard II., p. 1.\r\n\r\n  [51] Browne MSS.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the seventeenth century that markets were\r\nestablished in the neighbouring towns of Hawkshead and Ambleside,\r\nafter Grasmere had in vain attempted to secure the privilege.[52]\r\n\r\n  [52] Rydal Hall MSS.\r\n\r\nA good deal of informal business besides was conducted in the\r\nchurchyard, such as sales proposed or private bargains struck. Of\r\nproclamations and sale notices made within the church or garth we\r\nhave abundant evidence; and for these the clerk received generally a\r\nfee of 2d. No doubt the \"citation\" we hear of for tithe wool due to\r\nSquire John Fleming (1631) was made at the church. The prohibition\r\nagainst cutting wood in Bainrigg (1768) which the Rev. J. Wilson\r\nsuggested should \"be given at our church of sunday\" and which was to\r\ndeprive the holder of his winter fuel, has been preserved.[53] In\r\nrecent times, according to Edward Wilson, the notices were given out\r\nby the clerk in the yard, outside the so-called men's or western door.\r\n\r\n  [53] Rydal Hall MSS.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the townships transacted business at church; and the\r\nnotices still hung in church porches are a survival of the custom.\r\nThe overseers of the poor worked in fact in close connection with the\r\nwardens; and the latter were responsible for some county rates which\r\nare found entered in their accounts, such as (1708) \"To the Jaylor\r\nat Appleby\" and \"Prisoner Money.\" The Overseers' books for Rydal and\r\nLoughrigg show that when they failed to board a pauper within their\r\ntownship, they paid to the clerk 2d. \"for advertising her to let.\"\r\n\r\nThe constable (and there was one for each township) had a far older\r\nconnection with the parish church. He caused meetings for his\r\ndivision to be proclaimed at the church. Among the miscellaneous\r\nduties which he still performed in late times was payment for the\r\nslaughter of harmful beasts and birds. The heads of these were hung,\r\nwe are told, on the church gates as visible proof; and Stockdale,\r\nwriting in 1872,[54] says that he has seen them so exposed both\r\nat Cartmel and Hawkshead. The same practice no doubt prevailed at\r\nGrasmere. The constable's books for Rydal and Loughrigg record 4d. as\r\nthe price usually given for a raven's head, and 3s. 4d. for that of a\r\nfox. In 1786, 5s. 0d. was paid \"for one old Fox and two young ones.\"\r\nRavens were frequently entered, and as the payments went to William\r\nParke, we must suppose them to have been taken on the precipice of\r\nNab Scar. Five were paid for in 1787, and twelve in 1790. These would\r\ndecorate the Rydal and Loughrigg gate. Two foxes were paid for in\r\n1793.\r\n\r\n  [54] _Annales Caermoelensis._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nNot Twenty-four, but Eighteen represented the interests of the\r\ntownships in the parish church. This was the case also at Crosthwaite\r\nin Cumberland, where this ancient body of \"sworn\" men were swept away\r\nby the Charity Commissioners at the time that they took over the\r\nschools. Of the Eighteen in Grasmere six represented--along with two\r\nwardens--each township. While the wardens, who were all landholders,\r\ntook office for one year only, and in rotation, like all other\r\nofficials of the village communities, such as constable, overseer,\r\nsurveyor of roads, and frithman, the Eighteen appear to have been\r\nfreely elected, and they kept office for an indefinite period.\r\n\r\nThe names of those who served the office at the Restoration are given\r\nin the important document concerning the fabric of the church printed\r\nlater, and these names were but slowly altered. In the churchwardens'\r\nbooks of 1723 is written \"Then chosen Edward Brockbank to be an\r\nEighteen man for Little Langdale in the place of John Brockbank his\r\nfather, deceased.\" Again in 1824 comes \"Sides-Man Chosen by the\r\nMinister Churchwardens and Sides-men,\" followed by their names. A\r\nlist of these was but infrequently written out, only an erasure\r\nmarking a change, as when in 1708 John Green, serving for Grasmere\r\n\"being Very Old and infirm, desired to be excused,\" and Thomas Green\r\ntook his place.\r\n\r\nThe choice of a new member of the body lay apparently with the\r\nEighteen themselves, the wardens, and the parson. This is still the\r\ncase in Windermere, where (I am told) the choice of a new member of\r\nthe Twenty-four is discussed in full vestry, the clergyman, however,\r\nfinally nominating.[55] Yet the Eighteen were acting representatives\r\nin church affairs of the folk of the townships. All contracts for the\r\nimprovement and alteration of the church were made by them. They were\r\nresponsible for the share of their township in its upkeep, and laid\r\na rate on the landholders to cover the yearly expenses. It is almost\r\ncertain that the appointment of a clerk and schoolmaster lay with\r\nthem and the wardens, though the parson no doubt sat at the conclave.\r\nWe have no means of knowing whether their powers extended further.[56]\r\n\r\n  [55] From Mr. George Browne, one of the Twenty-four.\r\n\r\n  [56] At Holme Cultram, Cumberland, a like body--chosen, however,\r\n  by the people themselves--were responsible for the care of\r\n  the bridges and common wood, besides providing for the upkeep\r\n  of the sea-dyke. See \"The Sixteen Men of Holme Cultram,\"\r\n  _Transactions_, Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian Society,\r\n  N.S., 3. The Eighteen of Aston, Oxfordshire, were found in 1583\r\n  to have control over the common field and meadow, with the\r\n  yearly allotments made within them. See \"Survival of Archaic\r\n  Communities,\" Prof. F. W. Maitland (_Law Quarterly Review_, vol.\r\n  9). Prof. Maitland regards the existence of this body as an\r\n  exceptional case, and thinks it dangerous to assume it to have\r\n  been a survival of ancient times. Mr. G. G. Coulton in _Chaucer\r\n  and his England_ considers that the Black Death of 1348-9 and the\r\n  consequent diminution of the clergy may have thrown the people\r\n  on their own resources, and caused the lay control over parish\r\n  finances which appears to have dated (he says) from the fifteenth\r\n  century.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the old name for them was simply \"The\r\nEighteen.\" They are called Questmen in a contract of 1687, but this\r\nappears to have been drawn up by a stranger. The term Sidesmen occurs\r\nlate, and so does \"The Twenty-four\" which reckons the six wardens,\r\ntwo for each township, in the number. Strictly, the wardens (of whom\r\nthere were eight in Cartmel) should not be included.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decorative]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Structure of the Interior of S^t Oswald's\r\n  Grasmere.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nRECORDS\r\n\r\nPATRONS\r\n\r\nMONASTIC CONTROL\r\n\r\nTHE CLERGY\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL WARS\r\n\r\nTHE COMMONWEALTH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe church constitution of Grasmere was therefore from early times\r\nthat of a parish controlled and administered by a body of men\r\nrepresenting the people, who were responsible for the funds that\r\nmaintained the building and its services, while the clergy who\r\nofficiated were supported by the ancient system of the payment of\r\ntithes.\r\n\r\nThe offering of pious folk of the tenth of their yearly yield was at\r\nfirst intended to cover all expenses, but it soon became diverted\r\ninto purely ecclesiastical channels. The tithe-paying parish indeed\r\nearly excited the cupidity of the least scrupulous members of Church\r\nand State. Already in 1254 a rector of Grasmere is found to be\r\ndrawing the revenues of the parish without troubling to serve it\r\nexcept by deputy; for the Pope in that year granted a dispensation to\r\nHenry de Galdington, rector of \"Grossemer\" in the diocese of York, to\r\nhold an additional benefice with cure of souls.[57] This is the first\r\nrecord of the church discovered so far.\r\n\r\n  [57] _Calendar of Papal Registers_, vol. ii., p. 294.\r\n\r\nThe value of the rectory is stated in the dispensation to be ten\r\nmarks (£6 13s. 4d.). Estimates, however, varied widely. About 1291 a\r\ntaxation was made out for all ecclesiastical benefices in England,\r\nthe cause being Pope Nicholas I.'s promise of the tenths which he\r\nclaimed from them, to Edward I. for a term of six years, towards the\r\nexpenses of a crusade. This great valuation remained the standard\r\nof taxation until the time of Henry VIII. It is said to have been\r\ncompleted for the Province of York in 1292; and it sets down the\r\n\"church of Gressemere\" in the Archdeaconry of Richmondshire as being\r\nworth £16, and that of Wynandermere as £10.[58]\r\n\r\n  [58] _Tax. Eccle. P. Nicholai_, iv.\r\n\r\nBut the high valuation of 1292 did not hold good. Complaints from the\r\nnorthern clergy that through impoverishment by various causes, but\r\nchiefly the invasions of the Scots, they were by no means able to pay\r\nso high a tax, produced some amelioration. A correction was made in\r\n1318, when Windermere was written down at £2 13s. 4d., and Grasmere\r\nat £3 6s. 8d., or five marks. And at this figure it remained.\r\n\r\nIt stood indeed at five marks in 1283, when the first mention of the\r\nchurch occurs in connection with the secular lordship.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S NOTE.\r\n\r\n     The writing down of the value of the tithes of Grasmere was the\r\n     subject of correspondence between the author and myself, and\r\n     she writes: \"The so called taxation of Pope Nicholas IV. was\r\n     acknowledged to be too high for the Northern Counties; but the\r\n     reduction of Grasmere, when the alteration was made in 1318,\r\n     from £16 to five marks (£3 6s. 8d.) is unaccountable to me.\" It\r\n     had stood at this figure previously but had been raised to £16,\r\n     and, as will be seen in the text, as early as 1301 in the reign\r\n     of Edward I., when the abbot of St. Mary's, York, was allowed\r\n     to appropriate \"the chapels of Gresmer and Wynandermere,\"\r\n     Gresmer is described as being worth £20. In 1344, at the\r\n     Archbishop's Visitation, it is described as worth 5 marks; only\r\n     to be again raised in 1435. In that year upon the death of\r\n     John, duke of Bedford and earl of Kendal, to whom they had been\r\n     granted by his father, Henry IV., we find among the items of his\r\n     property \"the advowsons of Wynandermere and Gressemere each of\r\n     which is worth £20 yearly.\" After this the tithes again reverted\r\n     to 5 marks and in the reign of Henry VIII. the \"pension\" paid to\r\n     the abbey is put down as only half of that sum, viz. £1 13s. 4d.\r\n     at which it still remains.\r\n\r\n     The terms \"pension\" and \"advowson\" may not always mean the same\r\n     thing, thus advowson seems to be used sometimes as synonymous\r\n     with tithe. Hence Miss Armitt writes \"The parish churches, such\r\n     as Kendal, Grasmere, etc., were \"taxed\" from the twelfth century\r\n     onward at a certain figure--ten marks (£6 13s. 4d.) £16 or\r\n     £30. What did this taxation represent? The absolute sum to be\r\n     paid by the rector from the tithes to king, pope, archdeacon,\r\n     court, or feudal lord? or was it a valuation only of the tithes,\r\n     from which was calculated the amounts of the various 'scots'\r\n     or annual payments to ecclesiastical or temporal authorities?\"\r\n     It seems not unlikely that the rise from £3 6s. 8d. to £20 in\r\n     the reign of Edward I. may be accounted for by the fact that\r\n     the \"Old Valor\" which was granted by authority of Innocent the\r\n     fourth to Henry III. in 1253 was superseded in 1291 by the \"New\r\n     Valor\" granted to Edward I. by Nicholas IV., so that when Henry\r\n     IV. granted the chapels of Grasmere and Windermere to his son\r\n     John they were valued in 1435 at £20 each. They were only being\r\n     put back to the sum named in the \"New Valor\" of 1291 which had\r\n     been allowed in 1344 to drop to the 5 marks at which they had\r\n     stood in the \"Old Valor.\" The tithe taxation as established by\r\n     the \"New Valor\" remained in force until Henry VIII. But a \"Nova\r\n     Taxatio\" which only affected part of the province of York was\r\n     commanded in 11 Edward II. (1317) on account of the invasion of\r\n     the Scots and other troubles. These various taxings will account\r\n     for the variation in payments which were collected for the\r\n     benefit of the king.\r\n\r\n  W.F.R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PATRONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Rufus, upon his conquest of Carlisle, gave over to Ivo de\r\nTailbois all these parts as a fief. After Ivo a confusion of tenure\r\nand administration prevails, into which it is useless to enter. The\r\nline of patrons of Grasmere may perhaps be begun safely with Gilbert\r\nfitz Reinfred, who married Helwise, daughter and heiress of William\r\nde Lancaster II., because it was he who first held the Barony of\r\nKendal in chief from Richard I., by charter dated 1190.[59]\r\n\r\n  [59] _Lancashire Pipe Rolls_, Mr. W. Farrer.\r\n\r\nHis son William, called de Lancaster III., died in 1246 without a\r\ndirect heir; and the children of his sisters, Helwise and Alice,\r\nshared the fief between them. It is Alice's line that we have to\r\nfollow. She married William de Lindesey, and her son Walter took that\r\nportion of the barony which was later known as the Richmond Fee, and\r\nwhich included the advowson of our church.\r\n\r\nSir William de Lindesey, his son, was the next inheritor. After his\r\ndeath, in 1283, a jury of true and tried men declared that he had\r\ndied possessed of \"A certain chapel there (Gresmer) taxed yearly\r\nat 66s 8d.\"[60] The chapel of Windermere, set down at a like sum,\r\nbelonged to the same lordship.\r\n\r\n  [60] _Lancashire Inquests_, _etc._, ed. by Mr. Farrer.\r\n\r\nChristiana, William's heiress, was then only 16. She was married to\r\na Frenchman, Ingelram de Gynes, lord of Coucy. There is evidence\r\nthat they spent a considerable part of their time in these parts,\r\ntheir seat being at Mourholm, near Carnforth. Ingelram indeed\r\nfought in the Scottish wars, as did his son William. Christiana\r\nsurvived her husband some ten years. They had at least four sons,\r\nWilliam, Ingelram, Baldwin, and Robert. It was William who inherited\r\nthe chief part of Christiana's property in the barony of Kendal,\r\nwhich was declared (1334) to include the manor of Wynandermere,\r\nand the advowsons of the chapels of Wynandermere, Marieholm, and\r\nGressemere.[61]\r\n\r\n  [61] _Calendar Patent Rolls_, 8 Edw. III. and 14 Edw. III., pt.\r\n  3, mem. 11.\r\n\r\nThe new tenant at once incurred King Edward III.'s displeasure. His\r\ninterests lay apparently in France, where he resided, being styled\r\nlord of Coucy[62]; and without waiting to do homage for his mother's\r\nEnglish lands and receiving them formally from the king's hands (as\r\nwas the feudal custom), he passed them over to his young son William.\r\nThe king pardoned the offence, and ratified the grant,[63] but he\r\nkept the youth, still a minor in 1339, about his person,[64] and\r\nWilliam's short life seems to have been spent in service under the\r\nEnglish banner.[65]\r\n\r\n  [62] _Calendar Patent Rolls_, 8 Edw. III. There was a question of\r\n  a marriage between his daughter Mary and the king's brother.\r\n\r\n  [63] _Calendar Patent Rolls_, 8 Edw. III.\r\n\r\n  [64] _Calendar Patent Rolls_, 13 Edw. III.\r\n\r\n  [65] _Calendar Patent Rolls._\r\n\r\nThe family of de Gynes had a difficult part to play during the wars\r\nthat followed upon Edward's claim to the throne of France. Their\r\nhereditary instincts carried them naturally into the opposite camp,\r\nand they lost their English possessions in consequence. On William's\r\ndeath in 1343 the king--while he seems to have acknowledged the claim\r\nof his brother Ingelram as his heir,[66] kept the heritage in his own\r\nhands. Moreover, he declared such lands as were held by Robert de\r\nGynes, a son of Christiana, who was a cleric and Dean of Glasgow, to\r\nbe forfeited, because of Robert's adherence to his enemy,[67] and for\r\nthe same reason lands at Thornton in Lonsdale held by Ingelram, son\r\nof Ingelram and grandson of Christiana, were likewise forfeited.[68]\r\n\r\n  [66] _Calendar Patent Rolls_, 17 Edw. III.\r\n\r\n  [67] _Calendar Patent Rolls_, 17 Edw. III.\r\n\r\n  [68] _Calendar of Close Rolls._\r\n\r\nThe king presently used the escheated heritage to reward a knight\r\nwho had served him well in the Scottish wars. John de Coupland had\r\nhad the courage and address to secure Robert Bruce as prisoner at\r\nthe battle of Durham; and Edward in 1347 granted to him and his wife\r\nfor their joint lives the Lindesey Fee which was the inheritance of\r\nIngelram. He excepted, however, from the grant (along with the park\r\nand woodlands about Windermere) the knight's fees and advowsons of\r\nchurches belonging to the same.[69]\r\n\r\n  [69] _Calendar Patent Rolls_ and _Close Rolls_, 22 Edw. III.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of war brought Ingelram, lord of Coucy, and son of\r\nIngelram, William's brother, as hostage for John, king of France,\r\nto the court of Edward. There he gained by his handsome person and\r\nknightly grace the favour of the king, who granted him the lands of\r\nWestmorland which had belonged to his great-grandmother Christiana,\r\ncreated him Earl of Bedford, and gave him in 1365 his daughter\r\nIsabella in marriage. Ingelram for some time satisfied his martial\r\ninstincts by fighting in the wars of Italy and Alsace; but on the\r\nrenewal of the struggle between England and France, followed by the\r\ndeath of his father-in-law in 1377, his scruples were at an end. He\r\nrenounced his allegiance to England, haughtily returned the badge of\r\nthe Order of the Garter, and joined the side of Charles II.[70]\r\n\r\n  [70] Rymer's _Foedera_, _Dic. of Nat. Biography_. \"Proof that\r\n  Ingelram Earl of Bedford was son of Ingelram brother of William,\r\n  who was son of William de Coucy, Christiana's son, is contained\r\n  in _Inq. p.m._, 50 Edw. III. (1) No. 18.\" Mr. W. Farrer.\r\n\r\nThe Lindesey Fee was once more forfeited to the Crown. Richard II.\r\ngranted it, however, to Phillipa, daughter of Ingelram and Isabella,\r\nand to her husband Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford (1382); and when\r\nthe latter was outlawed by Parliament in 1388 it was confirmed to\r\nher.[71] After her death (1411) she was declared to have been seised\r\nof the advowson of the chapel of Grismere, taxed at £10, and that of\r\nWynandermere, taxed at 100s.[72]\r\n\r\n  [71] _Calendar Patent Rolls_, 5 Rich. II., 9 Rich. II., and 2\r\n  Hen. IV., part iv.\r\n\r\n  [72] _Inq. p.m._ MS. Rawl., B 438, f. 71.\r\n\r\nPhillipa had no children. Henry IV. now granted the Fee to his\r\nson, John, created duke of Bedford and earl of Kendal. He died in\r\n1435. His property in the barony of Kendal included the \"advowsons\r\nof Wynandermere and of Gressemere, each of which is worth 20 li\r\nyearly.\"[73]\r\n\r\n  [73] _Inq. p.m._, 14 Hen. VI., No. 36.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bedford's widow, Jaquetta of Luxemburg, received the\r\nthird part of the Fee as her dower, with the advowson \"of the church\r\nin Gresmere.\" She married Richard Woodville, created earl Rivers.\r\nAfter her death she is said (1473) to have possessed \"the advowson or\r\nnomination of the church or chapel of Gressemere,\" though in 1439 she\r\nhad allowed her privilege to lapse.[74]\r\n\r\n  [74] _Calendar Patent Rolls_, 1 Edw. IV., pt. 7, mem. 8; and\r\n  _Inq. p.m._, 12 Edw. IV., No. 47.\r\n\r\nThe Fee was next granted by Henry VI. (who inherited it as heir to\r\nhis uncle John) to John Beaufort, duke of Somerset.[75] The duke's\r\ndaughter Margaret--afterwards countess of Richmond--came into\r\npossession of it at his death.[76] After a lapse, when Yorkists sat\r\non the throne, and Sir William Parr of Kendal held it, the Fee (now\r\nincluding the advowson of Grasmere) returned to Margaret and passed\r\nto her grandson Henry VIII. He sold the advowson and patronage of\r\nGrasmere. Its subsequent history will be given later.\r\n\r\n  [75] _Calendar Patent Rolls_, 22 Hen. VI.\r\n\r\n  [76] _Inq. p.m._, 22 Hen. VI., No. 19.\r\n\r\nSuch was the illustrious line of our church's early patrons--some\r\nof them the most striking figures in a chivalrous age. But it is\r\nnot to be supposed that they knew much of the little parish hidden\r\namongst the mountains. When the rectorate fell vacant, they would\r\ngrant the post to some suppliant clerk or priest, who would carry\r\ntheir nomination to the higher ecclesiastical authorities. The right\r\nto nominate often fell into the king's hands, through minority of the\r\nheir, confiscation, or inheritance. For instance, the king appointed\r\nto the rectory of Windermere in 1282, in 1377 and in 1388. Edward\r\nIII. nominated Edmund de Ursewyk to \"Gressemer\" in 1349; and Henry\r\nIV. did the same for Walter Hoton in 1401.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONASTIC CONTROL\r\n\r\n\r\nOur church of Grasmere was not left to the control of parson and\r\nmanorial lord like other tithe-yielding parishes, it was snapped up\r\nby a big monastery. The abbeys that had sprung up all over England\r\nin post-Norman times were of a very different order from the simple\r\nreligious communities of Anglo-Saxon times; and before long it became\r\na question as to how they were to be maintained on the splendid lines\r\nof their foundation. By the reign of Henry I. they had begun to\r\nappropriate rectories, and in 1212 the parish church of Crosthwaite\r\nwas given over to the control of Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire, which\r\ncarried off all the profits of the tithes, merely restoring £5 a\r\nyear to the rector, who was elected by its chapter.[77] St. Mary's\r\nAbbey had been founded in York city in 1088, and its chapter found\r\nit necessary by the end of the thirteenth century to look round\r\nthe great church province of Richmondshire to see if there were no\r\nrevenues which might by royal favour be appropriated.\r\n\r\n  [77] _Victorian History of Cumberland._\r\n\r\nIn December, 1301, Edward I. despatched a writ to the sheriff of\r\nWestmorland, bidding him inquire of true and lawful men whether it\r\nwould be to the damage of the Crown or others if the abbey of St.\r\nMary of York were allowed to appropriate the church of Kirkeby in\r\nKendale with its chapels and appurtenances.\r\n\r\nThe inquisition was held, be it noted, not at Kendal but at Appleby,\r\nwhere a sworn jury declared the appropriation would damage no one.\r\nAn explicit statement was added which concerns us. \"The chapels of\r\nthe said church, to wit the chapels of Gresmer and Winandermere are\r\nin the patronage of Lord Ingram de Gynes and Christian his wife, by\r\nreason of the inheritance of the said Christian, and they hold of\r\nthe king in chief.... And the chapel of Gresmer is worth yearly 20\r\nli.\"[78]\r\n\r\n  [78] _Inq. ad quod damnum_, 38/6.\r\n\r\nAccordingly a license was granted by Edward I., under date February\r\n23rd, 1302, for the Abbot and Convent of St. Mary's, York, \"towards\r\nthe relief of their impoverished condition,\" to appropriate the\r\n\"church of Kirkeby in Kendale, which is of their own patronage, in\r\nthe diocese of York, and consists of two portions, on condition that\r\nthey appropriate none of its chapels, if there are any.\"[79]\r\n\r\n  [79] _Calendar Patent Rolls_, 30 Edw. I.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation took effect; and moreover the Abbey succeeded in\r\ngaining jurisdiction over the \"chapels\" of Windermere and Grasmere.\r\nThe nomination of the rector indeed remained in the hands of the\r\nlord of the Fee, but it was passed on to the chapter of the Abbey\r\nfor confirmation, before being finally ratified by the Archdeacon\r\nof Richmondshire. Thus three august authorities had to bestir\r\nthemselves, when a fresh parson was needed for our parish; and in\r\n1349 King Edward III., the Abbot of St. Mary and Archdeacon Henry de\r\nWalton were all concerned in the business.[80] No doubt the monks\r\nseized the right to nominate whenever they could, and in 1439 George\r\nPlompton was named by them before his admission by the archdeacon.[81]\r\n\r\n  [80] _Calendar Patent Rolls._\r\n\r\n  [81] _Calendar Patent Rolls_, 17 Hen. VI., p. 1.\r\n\r\nThis change was not put into effect, however, without fierce\r\nopposition in the district. In 1309 an appeal went up to the king\r\nfrom the Abbot of St. Mary, who styled himself \"parson of the church\r\nof Kirkeby in Kendale,\" wherein he stated that when his servants had\r\ngone to carry in the tithe corn and hay, they had been assaulted by\r\nWalter de Strykeland and others; and moreover that Roger, the vicar\r\nand the other chaplains and clerks appointed to celebrate divine\r\nservice in that church, hindered them in the discharge of the same,\r\ntrampled down and consumed his corn and hay, and took away the horses\r\nfrom his waggons and impounded them. Whereupon three justices were\r\nappointed to adjudicate upon the case.[82]\r\n\r\n  [82] _Calendar Patent Rolls._\r\n\r\nFrom this it would be seen that the local clergy were as bitterly\r\nopposed to the monastic rule as the gentry and the people. Sir\r\nWalter de Strickland with armed servants at his command headed\r\nthe opposition. His lands at Sizergh lay to the south of the town\r\nof Kendal and he refused to the men of the monastery right of way\r\nacross them for the collection of the tithes of corn, which was\r\nalways made while the stooks stood upright in the field. After much\r\nwrangling, for no abbot was ever known to withdraw a claim, articles\r\nof agreement were made out between them, which reiterated the\r\nstatement that the church of Kirkby Kendal was \"canonically possessed\r\nin proper use\" by the monastery.[83] However, the convent found it\r\neasier to let the tithes to the opponent, rather than to wrestle with\r\nan obstructionist policy; and in 1334 Sir Walter is found agreeing\r\nto furnish to the monastic granary now established at Kirkby Kendal\r\nthree good measures of oatmeal for the tithe of the sheaves of\r\nSigredhergh, sold to him by the abbot and convent.[84]\r\n\r\n  [83] Sizergh Castle MSS.\r\n\r\n  [84] MS. Dodsworth 28, fol. 78.\r\n\r\nBut the people were not appeased, and when in 1344 the archbishop\r\nmade a visitation, opportunity was taken to lay before him, in the\r\nname of \"the common right,\" complaints against the monopoly of funds\r\nby the convent, as the following document shows:--\r\n\r\n Release of the Abbot and Convent of the Monastery of St. Mary,\r\n York, concerning their churches, pensions, and portions.\r\n\r\n In the name of God, Amen, Since we, William, by divine\r\n permission Archbishop of York, ... in our progress of visitation\r\n which we have lately performed in and of our diocese ... have\r\n found that the religious men the Abbot and Convent of the\r\n monastery of St. Mary, against the common right detain the\r\n parish churches and chapels, portions, pensions, and parochial\r\n tithes underwritten, namely, ... the annual pensions in the\r\n parts of Richmond: of the church of Richmond 100s. and 20\r\n lbs of wax, ... of the vicarage of Kirkby Kendall £4, of the\r\n churches of Gresmere and Winandermers 5 marks.... We have\r\n commanded the said abbot and convent ... to show their rights\r\n and titles before us and have caused them to be called, ... and\r\n we ... having considered the rights and good faith of the said\r\n religious men ... release the said abbot and convent ... as\r\n canonical possessors of the said churches, chapels, portions,\r\n pensions (&c).... Dated at Cawood, on the 20th day of the month\r\n of August in the year of our Lord MCCCXLIIIJ, and in the third\r\n year of our pontificate.[85]\r\n\r\nThe appeal had been made in vain. Yet opposition could not have\r\nceased, as the case was finally carried to Rome. In 1396 a\r\nconfirmation of the abbey's possessions (including the chapels of\r\nGresmere and Wynandremere, worth 5 marks each) was made by the Pope,\r\non petition by the abbey, according to letters patent of Thomas\r\nArundel, late archbishop of York, dated November, 1392.[85]\r\n\r\n  [85] _Calendar of Papal Registers_, vol. v., p. 1-4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLERGY\r\n\r\n\r\nThough not successful, Sir Walter de Strickland's opposition had done\r\nsome good, but for exactly 200 years longer did the monastery by the\r\nwalls of the city of York hold sway over the church of Grasmere. In\r\nwhat degree its influence was felt in the mountain parish cannot be\r\ntold, or what it gave in return for the pension it abstracted. It\r\nmay have assisted in the rebuilding of the edifice, lending aid by\r\nmonastic skill in architecture. Probably it supervised the worship\r\nin the church, and improved the ritual, passing on to the village\r\npriest the tradition of its own richly furnished sanctuary. Signs\r\nwere not wanting at the Reformation that the district had been\r\necclesiastically well served.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that the parson of the parish was a pluralist\r\nand a non-resident as early as 1254; and so were those of his\r\nsuccessors of whom we have evidence. The glimpses obtained through\r\nscant record disclose the tithe-taking rector of the valley as a\r\nfigure distinguished by education, if not by family, and known to\r\nthe lofty in station. He is termed \"Master,\" and bears the suffix\r\n\"clerk\"; while \"Sir\" is reserved for the curate, his deputy, who\r\nhas not graduated at either university.[86] He was skilled in law\r\nmore than in theology. He may have served an apprenticeship in the\r\ngreat office of the Chancery; sometimes men of his position are\r\ntermed \"king's clerk.\"[87] He was not an idle man, and was often\r\nemployed in secular business by the lord of the Fee. It may have\r\nbeen in the collection of the lady's dues--for the heiress Christiana\r\nde Lindesay, had married Ingelram de Gynes, of Coucy in France, in\r\n1283--that the parson of Grasmere suffered an assault (1290) at\r\nLeghton Gynes (later Leighton Conyers). It is certain that when\r\nRobert de Gynes, one of the sons of Christiana, and possessed of some\r\nof her lands about Casterton and Levens, went \"beyond the seas\" in\r\n1334, he empowered Oliver de Welle, parson of Grasmere, to act with\r\nThomas de Bethum as his attorney. Oliver de Welle had a footing in\r\nour valleys besides his parsonage, for he is stated to have held,\r\nunder the lord William de Coucy, deceased, \"a certain place called\r\nLittle Langedon in Stirkland Ketle,\" which was then (1352) in the\r\ncustody of the executor of his will, John de Crofte.[88]\r\n\r\n  [86] Dr. Cox, _Parish Registers of England_, p. 251.\r\n\r\n  [87] In 1383 Richard de Clifford, \"king's clerk\" was presented to\r\n  the church of Warton in Kendale, _Calendar Patent Rolls_.\r\n\r\n  [88] MS.

It\r\nwas in 1438-9 that he was nominated to the rectory of Grasmere, by\r\nthe Chapter of St. Mary's, and some years after he acquired that of\r\nBingham in Nottinghamshire. This he resigned (and doubtless Grasmere\r\nalso) in two or three years' time, owing to age and infirmities.\r\nHe retired to Bolton Abbey, and in 1459 obtained leave from the\r\nArchbishop of York to have service celebrated for himself and his\r\nservants within the walls of the monastery--a permit which gives a\r\npicture of affluent peace and piety in a few words.[91]\r\n\r\n  [91] Canon Raine's Notes to _Testamenta Eboracensia_, Sur.

Jackson.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURATES\r\n\r\nThe curates who officiated under the rectors were a different class\r\nof men. Constantly resident, and seemingly holding the post for\r\nlife, they belonged as a rule to the district--even it might be,\r\nto the township--as did William Jackson, who died 1569. A sharp\r\nboy, son of a statesman, might attract the notice of the parson,\r\nor of the visiting brother from St. Mary's Abbey. After serving an\r\napprenticeship, as attendant or acolyte within the church, he might\r\nbe passed on from the curate's tuition--for the latter almost always\r\ntaught school--to Kendal or even to the abbey at York. On being\r\nadmitted into the order of priesthood, he would return to his native\r\nplace (should the post be vacant) and minister week by week to the\r\nspiritual needs of his fellows and his kinsfolk. Sometimes he even\r\ntook up land to farm. Adam de Ottelay, \"chaplain,\" is set down in an\r\nundated rental of the early fourteenth century, as joining in tenure\r\nwith John \"del bancke.\"[96]\r\n\r\n  [96] Levens Hall MS.\r\n\r\nThe \"chaplain\" James Chamer, who witnessed a Grasmere deed in 1486,\r\nwas probably the curate there.[97] It must be remembered, however,\r\nthat the three townships appear to have been, from an early (but\r\nunknown) date, furnished with resident curates, acting under rector\r\nand abbot. Little Langdale too, if tradition be correct, had its\r\nreligious needs supplied by a chapel. It is possible, indeed,\r\nthat this may have been served through the priory of Conishead in\r\nFurness, to which William de Lancaster III.--the last baron to rule\r\nKendal as a whole, who died 1246--granted a settlement or grange\r\nat Baisbrowne and Elterwater, which was later called a manor. This\r\ngrange lay within Grasmere parish, as does the field below Bield,\r\nwhere tradition asserts the chapel to have stood. The first express\r\nmention of a chapel at Ambleside (within the township of Rydal and\r\nLoughrigg) is found in a document of Mr. G. Browne, dated 1584. But\r\nin the rental of 1505-6, William Wall, \"chaplain,\" is entered as\r\nholding in Ambleside one third of the \"pasture of Brigges.\" There\r\nis little doubt, therefore, that he was resident in the town, and\r\nuniting husbandry with his clerical office. Of a chapel in Great or\r\nMickle Langdale the first evidence that occurs (after the strong\r\npresumptive evidence of the four priests serving the parish to be\r\ngiven immediately) is the indenture of 1571, which expressly mentions\r\nit.\r\n\r\n  [97] Rydal Hall MS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE START OF THE REFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe revolution which Henry VIII. brought about in the ecclesiastical\r\nworld of England shook our parish, as the rest of England.\r\nNot content with the suppression and spoliation of the lesser\r\nmonasteries, he turned to the greater ones, whose riches in gold and\r\njewels, in land and revenue, excited his cupidity. Remote Grasmere\r\neven, by diversion of the pension she had dutifully paid her church\r\nsuperior, might supply something to the royal pocket! So the new\r\nsupreme Head of the Church is found in 1543, bartering what he could\r\nto two of those job-brokers of ecclesiastical property, who were so\r\nevil a feature of the Reformation. The parchment at Rydal Hall runs\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n     A Breuiate of the Kings Grant of Gersmire Advowson to Bell &\r\n     Broksbye in 35^{to} Hen. 8\r\n\r\nBe it remembered that in the charter of our most illustrious lord\r\nHenry the Eight, by the grace of God king of England, France, and\r\nIreland, defender of the faith, and on earth supreme head of the\r\nEnglish and Irish church, made to John Bell and Robert Brokelsby\r\nwithin named, among other things it is thus contained:--\r\n\r\n     The king to all to whom, &c. greeting. We do also give, for\r\n     the consideration aforesaid, and of our certain knowledge and\r\n     mere motion for us, our heirs and successors, do grant to\r\n     the aforesaid John Bell and Robert Brokelsbye, the advowson,\r\n     donation, denomination, presentation, free disposition, and\r\n     right of patronage of the Rectory of Gresmere in our county of\r\n     Westmorland, which, as parcel of the possessions and revenues\r\n     of the late Monastery of St. Mary near the wall of the City\r\n     of York, or otherwise or in any other manner or by any reason\r\n     whatsoever, has or have fallen, or may fall, into our hands.\r\n     Witness the king at Walden the twenty-first day of October in\r\n     the thirty-fifth year of our reign.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly a copy of but a part of the original charter, and the\r\n\"consideration\" which Henry received does not transpire; but in the\r\nfollowing month the two speculators procured a licence to sell again,\r\nand they passed over their purchase of the Grasmere advowson, and of\r\nall woods upon the premises--meaning no doubt the old demesne of the\r\nLindesay Fee--to Alan Bellingham, gent., for £30 11s. 5-1/2d.[98]\r\nBellingham in the same year purchased direct from the Crown that\r\nportion of Grasmere known as the Lumley Fee--thus gaining the\r\nlordship of some part of the valley.\r\n\r\n  [98] \"List of Rydall-Writings,\" by D.F., in which he writes the\r\n  names as Bellowe and Brokylsbee.\r\n\r\nHenry's sale of the advowson did not touch the tithes, which were\r\nleft in the hands of the rector; but he reserved for himself the\r\n\"pension\" of 2-1/2 marks which had been regularly paid out of them to\r\nthe abbey. It passed down with other Crown property to Charles II.,\r\nand in his reign was sold, according to an Act of Parliament which\r\nwas passed permitting the sale of such royal proceeds. Since that\r\ntime it has been in private hands, and bought and sold in the money\r\nmarket like stocks. It may perhaps be traced by sundry entries in\r\naccount books, as paid by the tithe-holder: in 1645, \"for a pension\r\nfor Gresmire due at Mich: last\" £1 13s. 4d. It was paid in 1729 by\r\nDr. Fleming as \"Fee-farm Rent\" to the Marquis of Caermarthen; and\r\nlater by Mr. Craike to the Duke of Leeds; while Sir William Fleming,\r\nas owner of the tithes of Windermere, paid the same from them.[99]\r\nIt is still paid through a London agent, being officially set down\r\nas \"Net Rent for Grasmere, £1. 6s. 8d.: Land tax, 6s. 8d.\" This sum\r\nrepresents--not five marks--but five nobles, or half-marks. Thus it\r\nmay be said that the dead hand of Henry VIII. still controls the\r\ntithes of Grasmere.\r\n\r\n  [99] Rydal Hall MSS. and Tax Eccles. P. Nicholai.\r\n\r\nThis tyrant wrought other changes for Grasmere. When creating the new\r\ndiocese of Chester, he swept our parts of Westmorland within it. The\r\narchdeaconry of Richmondshire remained, but the archdeacon was shorn\r\nof power. He no longer instituted our parson, as in the days prior to\r\nthe rule of St. Mary's Abbey, and this empty form fell to the Bishop\r\nof Chester; who, on the death of parson Holgill in 1548, appointed to\r\nthe office one Gabriel Croft, upon nomination by the patron.[100]\r\n\r\n  [100] Chester Diocesan Register.\r\n\r\nNow Croft was seemingly a man of unscrupulous temper. The boy Edward\r\nwas by this time upon the throne, and spoliation of church revenues\r\nwas, under his advisers and in the name of Protestantism, the order\r\nof the day. The parson of Grasmere was one of those who seized the\r\nopportunity offered by the general misrule; and he committed an act\r\nfor which there could be no legal pretext. Previous rectors had\r\ndrawn the tithes of the parish, and pocketed the large margin that\r\nremained, after the stipends of the worthy curates who did their work\r\nhad been paid. But Croft went beyond this. In 1549 he sold the tithes\r\non a lease, and not for the period of his life (which he might have\r\nclaimed as his right) but for ninety-seven years. The purchaser was\r\nhis patron, Dame Marion Bellingham of Helsington, widow; and she paid\r\nhim a lump sum of £58 11s. 5-1/2d., upon the agreement that she and\r\nher heirs would furnish from the tithes a stipend for the rector of\r\n£18 11s. 7d.[101]\r\n\r\n  [101] List of Rydall Writings. D.F.\r\n\r\nThe bargain, ratified by John, Bishop of Chester, was excellent for\r\nboth parties; but it was disastrous for the parish. So far, the\r\ntithes, however mismanaged, had lain in the hands of the church\r\nand the clergy, for whose support they were rendered. The Abbey\r\nof St. Mary, while exacting a pension from them, exercised in\r\nreturn a supervision that was doubtless of benefit; for under it,\r\nthe rector--though he took the bulk of them himself--could hardly\r\nescape providing the three priests resident within the parish with\r\nsufficient stipends. Moreover, as he was an absentee, it is probable\r\nthat he made a stable arrangement for their ingetting, that would\r\nbe convenient to himself and comfortable for the parishioners (such\r\nas obtained later), and that he even farmed them to the dalesmen\r\nthemselves. This method saved him the risks of an annual tithing\r\ncarried out by a paid agent, and it insured him a regular (if more\r\nmoderate) income, in easily transported silver money. The evidence\r\nof the lawsuits shows that the system of paying a certain fixed\r\nsum instead of the tenth in kind was actually in force for some\r\ncommodities, while in some cases this composition or prescription\r\nextended to the whole of a landed estate.\r\n\r\nThe change was sharp, from church control to control by a lay\r\nimproprietor, whose simple business it was to squeeze as large an\r\nincome as he could out of his investment. He was not likely to leave\r\nthe tithing on the old easy footing, nor was the parishioner inclined\r\nto increase his offering without resistance. Squire William Fleming\r\nwas a big enough man to front on his own account the common foe.\r\nAverring that, in satisfaction of all tithes the customary annual sum\r\nof 20s. had been paid for \"the demeanes of Rydall,\" he refused Alan\r\nBellingham's demand for a tenth of hay, wool and lambs taken from the\r\nyearly yield. Alan, who denied the custom, sued him in the Consistory\r\nCourt at York, including in his claim the proceeds of the years 1569\r\nto 1572, for which payment had been made. The spiritual court judged\r\nin his favour; whereupon Fleming carried the case to the civil court\r\nof King's Bench. Here, after several adjournments, and a trial before\r\njustices connected with the county, the final verdict was given in\r\nhis favour (1575).[102]\r\n\r\n  [102] _Coram Rege Roll_, N.T., 17 Eliz., ro. 218.\r\n\r\nBefore the case was settled, the contenders struck a bargain, and the\r\nownership of the advowson of Grasmere passed from Alan Bellingham\r\nof Fawcet Forrest, executor of Marion Bellingham, to the Rydal\r\nsquire for the sum of £100, and that of the remainder of the lease\r\nof the rectory and tithes for £500.[103] The tenfold increase of\r\nthe purchase money in twenty-four years time shows the enormous\r\nincrease in tithe value when in the grasp of lay hands; for a rise\r\nof agricultural prosperity would not account for it. Squire William\r\nnow became in his turn the oppressor; but the tale of the powerful\r\nopposition he roused in the parish must be left to another chapter.\r\nThe advowson remains yet in his family.\r\n\r\n  [103] Dated Nov. 3, 1573. \"List of Rydall Writings.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to the parsons. Croft, with an annuity assured to him,\r\nand a small capital in gold, no doubt troubled himself little about\r\nhis parish. He had defrauded it and crippled its funds for the\r\nnext hundred years. The curates we suppose stuck to their posts,\r\nthough where their stipends came from is a problem. Little change\r\nin ritual could have been made, before Edward's death and Mary's\r\naccession brought a reinstitution of the old form of faith, as well\r\nas a hopeless attempt to restore stolen church property. In 1554 the\r\nBishop of Chester held a visitation at Kendal for these parts, and\r\nthe officials of the parish are set down in the following list:--[104]\r\n\r\n  Gresmer.  Mr. Gabriel Croft, Rector ibm. pt.\r\n            Dns Willmus Jackson, pt. xh.\r\n            Dns Joh^{es} Hunter pt.\r\n            Dns Hugo Walton pt.\r\n\r\n            pt.

Hugo Gregg}\r\n\r\n  [104] Chester Diocesan Registry.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from this that three curates then served the\r\nparish--\"Dominus\" being the latinized \"sir\" of the customary title.\r\nOf the third in the list evidence is found in the parish register,\r\nwhere the burial is recorded on March 8th, 1577, of \"Hugh Watson\r\npreist,\" this no doubt being the correct form of his name. It seems\r\nlikely that he officiated in Ambleside, which by this time was a\r\nthriving little town. Of John Hunter nothing further is known: he may\r\nhave served the chapel in Langdale.\r\n\r\nRecord of William Jackson is found in his will:--[105]\r\n\r\n     Sir William Jackson _late curet at Gresmer_.\r\n\r\n     Jan. 21, 1569.

Prov. at election of a Mayor. Order that every\r\n     Alderman shall provide _a gowne_ for the following Sunday, or\r\n     be fined 40s. _Gowns_ according to an ancient order, to be all\r\n     of one form \"of blacke stuffe, to be faced with black plush or\r\n     velvet, _and Mr. Maior himselfe to have one readie_ against\r\n     Sunday next or else forfeit 40s.\"\r\n\r\n     (A 13). \"Abstract of fines of Leete Courte,\" Oct. 20, 1612.\r\n     Various penalties for misdemeanours.\r\n\r\n     \"Abstracte of Fines for the Bilawes Courte,\" Dec. 14, 1612.\r\n     Various injunctions and fines.\r\n\r\n     \"_Offerings and bridehowes_ allowed by Mr. Alderman\" (then\r\n     head of Corporation) and 4 Burgesses and the Vicar then being.\r\n     Bidden dinners or \"nutcastes, or _merie nightes_\" for money not\r\n     to exceed 12 persons. Same for \"_churching dinner_\" for monie\r\n     taking, only 12 wives allowed.\r\n\r\nFrom this will something may be gathered of the life of the village\r\npriest who belongs to the vale, and whose simple wish is to be buried\r\nby his two brothers within the church. He has his appointed chamber\r\nin his master's house--doubtless the rectory. His possessions are\r\nfew. There are some books, also parchment and wax, for the making of\r\nwills and indentures; there is the mattress on which he slept, and\r\na great \"chiste,\" in which no doubt papers and clothes were stored\r\ntogether. Of clothes he had a goodly stock, in jackets, gowns,\r\ntippets, caps, and the stout leather doublet which no doubt he donned\r\nfor his long tramps through storm and rain and snow to the dying. The\r\nsale of all these was to furnish money for his legacies--for coin he\r\nhad none. His benefactions are characteristic: loyally to his parish\r\nchurch a noble, or half a mark; to every servant of his master 12d.;\r\nto each of his godchildren 6d.; and he desires besides that an old\r\ndebt, incurred in his \"tyme of nede,\" should be paid in new money.\r\nSome crisis is suggested here, when the good wife of Under Helm\r\ncollected money for him.\r\n\r\nBut other facts may be gathered from this will. Our good curate\r\nbequeaths to \"Sir Thomas Benson\" his sarsnet tippet, clearly from its\r\nsuperior stuff, the best that he had. This, the usual outer dress\r\nof the priest, was a long garment made with sleeves, reaching to\r\nthe ankles, and was tied with a girdle.[106] Now a Thomas Benson,\r\n\"curate,\" witnessed the will of John Benson of Baisbrowne in 1563; he\r\nmust then have served the chapel of Langdale for a series of years.\r\nAlso it seems probable that the curate's master, John Benson, was the\r\nrector, succeeding Croft or another.\r\n\r\n  [106] Wall's _Old English Parish_.\r\n\r\nA spirit of peace and goodwill breathes through this document, and\r\none too that suggests continuity in the order of the church. Yet it\r\nmust be remembered that it was written in the reign of Elizabeth,\r\nwhen the Protestant religion had been firmly established by law, and\r\nwritten moreover by a man who had undoubtedly followed the Catholic\r\nritual fifteen years before. His fellow curate too of that date,\r\n\"preist\" Watson, was still alive, surviving him by eight years. There\r\nis a Protestant odour about the cassock, and Jackson possessed one;\r\nbut his wardrobe is distinctly of the old-world, priestly type. It\r\nis probable indeed that there was little change made for some time\r\neven in the services of the church. The people of the north-western\r\nmountains were conservative, and it was they who most stoutly\r\nresisted the suppression of the monasteries. There is evidence to\r\nshow that the new tenets were but slowly adopted in these parts.\r\nThe church at Crosthwaite was found as late as 1571 to be still in\r\npossession of the furniture and pictures that had lent a touch of\r\nsplendour to the former ritual; and they were then most stringently\r\nordered to be destroyed.[107]\r\n\r\n  [107] Victorian _History of Cumberland_.\r\n\r\nThe people were not likely to welcome changes that brought in their\r\ntrain not only impoverishment of service, but reduction in the number\r\nof the clergy; for with the diversion of the tithes, there ceased to\r\nbe any provision for the salaries of curates.\r\n\r\nLangdale did without a curate, and not until over 200 years was\r\nthe township once more blessed with a resident minister, though the\r\nchapel was used for services. Ambleside was in different case. Now a\r\nthriving little town, equally distant from the two parish churches\r\nthat claimed it, with fulling mills bringing in wealth, it was able\r\nto maintain a curate independently, and did so.\r\n\r\nJames Dugdale the cleric, who witnessed a Rydal deed in 1575, might\r\nhave been supposed to serve at Ambleside, only that Priest Watson was\r\nthen alive. Certain it is that in 1584 the townsfolk placed their\r\nsupport of chapel and curate on a solid basis, pledging each man his\r\nportion of land thereto. This was immediately before the appointment\r\nof John Bell as curate. The pledge was repeated in a deed of the year\r\n1597.\r\n\r\nThe rector of the parish, with no more than £18 odd as stipend,\r\nhad now to perform the entire duty of the wide parish. Nothing is\r\nknown of Croft's later dealings with the rectorate, nor of Lancelot\r\nLevens, who followed him. But on the latter's death in 1575, John\r\nWilson was instituted, and for fifty-two years he served as rector.\r\nFrom his handwriting, seen in the market-deed, and from the register\r\n(most negligently kept during his time of office) an unfavourable\r\nimpression is created. When he died in 1627, there followed--after\r\na few months interlude, when Robert Hogge served--the Rev. Henry\r\nWilson, B.A., who was to become notorious as a Royalist and\r\nHigh-Churchman. He was nominated by Dame Agnes Fleming, the clever\r\nwidow of Squire William, who at this time ruled at Rydal Hall for her\r\nson John.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the tithe gathering were not great. An item of\r\n2s. 0d. is paid to David Harrison, the Rydal inn-keeper, against\r\n\"tythinge,\" and \"for gathering tith Eggs\" 1s. 0d. These last\r\nofferings were paid in kind, and we know from subsequent accounts\r\nthat this persuasive office was somtimes filled by women, \"two\r\nwiues,\" being paid in 1643 \"for goeing 3 dayes gathering Eggs at\r\nEaster.\"\r\n\r\nThe later account-sheets kept by Richard Harrison show less\r\ncompletely than Tyson's the income derived from the tithes.\r\n\r\n                                                            li  s  d\r\n\r\n  Rec. in pt. of Lambe booke of gresmire at seaverall\r\n  tymes due before this 23 June 1643 due at Easter\r\n  last                                                      11  6  0\r\n\r\n  Rec. more in pt. of lambe booke, for gresmire that\r\n  was begun at Easter last.

In Tyson's accounts the even money received for\r\nit--as well as other entries which connect its payment with the\r\nholder of Padmire in Grasmere--give an appearance of it having been\r\nthen farmed, as it was at a later time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL WARS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the tithes were dropping in value; and this is\r\nlittle to be wondered at when the condition of the country is\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nWar was rife, and the \"troubles\" that affected every household--high\r\nand low, either in actual fighting or in tax-paying--were felt with\r\npeculiar poignancy at Rydal Hall. Squire John Fleming, as a rich\r\nman, had not stooped to conceal his religion, and had cheerfully\r\npaid his fine of £50 a year as a Catholic of the old faith. He died\r\non February 27, 1643, at an unfortunate time for his young children,\r\nwhen warfare was just beginning in the north-west. He was buried\r\nthe same evening, like many another recusant, in Grasmere Church;\r\nand though Parson Henry Wilson was paid a fee for \"ouersight of his\r\nburiall\" it is possible that mass was first said over the body in\r\nthe \"Chapel\" chamber at Rydal; for one Salomon Benson, a mysterious\r\nmember of the group of papists gathered about the Squire, in receipt\r\nof a pension of five marks a year, was probably a priest.\r\n\r\nThe orphaned children--two girls growing to womanhood and a younger\r\nboy--were now left with all the wealth that would be eventually\r\ntheirs, in charge of executors. Chief among these was Richard\r\nHarrison, a nephew of the Squire, and a Roman Catholic. He appears\r\nto have lived with his wife and son at Rydal Hall, and to have had\r\nentire management of the household in the years that followed.\r\n\r\nThe position was a difficult one, and naturally grew more so as\r\ntime went on, and success began to attend the Parliamentary party.\r\nThe money-coffers of Squire John were freely dipped into for loans\r\nto support the Royal cause, which the young heir joined in person;\r\nand the house was the resort of Royalist soldiers and gentlemen of\r\nthe neighbourhood. As a consequence, it was peculiarly obnoxious\r\nto the supporters of the Parliament, and was likewise detested by\r\nthe Puritans as a hotbed of Papists. Therefore, when the houses\r\nof Royalists were sacked up and down the county, there was little\r\nprobability that it would escape.\r\n\r\nA tradition has always existed that Rydal Hall was entered and\r\nplundered by the soldiers of the Commonwealth; but it is in the\r\naccount-sheets of Richard Harrison that explicit evidence of the fact\r\nhas now, and for the first time, been found. The catastrophe would\r\nbelong wholly to Rydal history, but for a clause in the accounts\r\nwhich concerns Grasmere church.\r\n\r\nDates are difficult to follow in the sheets, but it is clear that\r\nthe year 1644 marked the turning-point of the war. The hopes of the\r\nRoyalists had been high when Prince Rupert marched through Lancashire\r\nto meet the enemy; but they were crushed by the terrible defeat of\r\nMarston Moor on July 1st. The king's forces in these parts were\r\ncompletely scattered, and there was a tremendous exodus of loyalists,\r\nwho left to join the king's army in the south. The band was led by\r\nSir Francis Howard, and it included the young heir of Rydal. The\r\nexodus is marked in the account-sheets by the numerous sums borrowed\r\nfrom the Rydal chests by various people, beginning with the chief\r\nhimself. Even the loyal parsons borrowed, and small sums were lent\r\nabout this time to two of the Cumberland curates, who possibly went\r\noff on king's business too. Henry Wilson, the rector of Grasmere, was\r\na noted Royalist, and apparently acted as an emissary in the cause.\r\nThe following entry records one of the many loans to him, at a time\r\nwhen he too was leaving the country:--\r\n\r\n                                                                li s d\r\nLent parson wilson upon his note by & with the consent of Mr.\r\n  Phillipson & Mr. Willm. wch. makes that he hath lately lent\r\n  8 li wch. he will either repay or els giue satisfaction that\r\n  it may allow when he comes & serues the cure at Gressmire\r\n  Church lent him this the 13 July                              5 10 0\r\n\r\nIt is clear that in this year, 1644, the hall and its inmates shared\r\nin the general sufferings. Friendly messengers rode by night to give\r\nwarning when another hall was sacked. Hostile soldiers were quartered\r\non the premises, and some pillaging of horses and other things was\r\ndone, for which Harrison tried to obtain restitution. He also sought\r\nprotection--if it might be granted by wire-pulling and bribery--from\r\nColonels Bellingham and Briggs, who commanded the Scots troops in\r\nWestmorland. It is possible that the new glass required both for the\r\nhall and for the choir of Grasmere church, \"which was broken,\" may\r\nhave been the result of some hostile demonstration.\r\n\r\nBut the actual raid upon the hall was made at Eastertide, 1645. The\r\nsoldiers of \"Captaine Orfer & Collonell Lawson\" entered it, searched\r\nfor money and took all they could find (which was little) and carried\r\noff Richard Harrison to prison, where he remained till Pentecost.\r\n\r\nFurther mischief is recorded in another paragraph of the sheets, when\r\nthe sum of £2 4s. 8d. is set down at Easter, 1645, as \"pd. for bread\r\nand wine twice at Gresmire Church in regard it was once plundered by\r\nLawson's souldiers.\"\r\n\r\nNow this provision for the Easter communion, which the tithe-holder\r\nwas bound to make, was a special provision, always accounted for\r\nseparately, and probably delivered direct to the church from the wine\r\nmerchant, whose name is occasionally mentioned. So in this case, the\r\nchurch itself was presumably entered with violence, and by the same\r\ntroop that visited Rydal Hall.\r\n\r\nIt was a Cumberland troop that did the mischief, as is evident from\r\nthe names of the officers. Colonel Wilfred Lawson of the Isell\r\nfamily was an ardent fighter for the Parliament. Captain Orfeur was\r\ndoubtless a member of the stock of Plumbland Hall.[108]\r\n\r\n  [108] He may have been one of the brothers of William, head of\r\n  the family, who died in 1660. See \"The Orfeurs of High Close,\"\r\n  _Transactions_ Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian Society,\r\n  vol. iii.\r\n\r\nThe troop may have marched from the siege of Carlisle Castle, which\r\nhad been held for the king through the winter; and nothing is more\r\nlikely than that, on their march over the Raise, they would halt at\r\nGrasmere, and do what despite they could to a sacred building held\r\nby an episcopalian parson and a recusant patron, who were of course\r\nodious for their so-called \"delinquency.\" The event, however, is\r\ninferred rather than actually stated in Harrison's account.[109]\r\n\r\n  [109] It is necessary to be explicit on this point, for, on the\r\n  authority of the writer's MS., a statement that the church of\r\n  Grasmere was broken into by the Parliamentary forces appeared\r\n  twice in print in 1910, without any reference being given to the\r\n  actual source of information, or its ambiguity.\r\n\r\nAt Whitsuntide, on his release from prison, Richard Harrison\r\nreturned to his post at Rydal Hall as factotum and financier. The\r\nposition became steadily worse. Young William Fleming had returned\r\nfrom Bristol, after reverses in the south, only to be captured and\r\nimprisoned in Kendal; and his freedom had to be procured by a heavy\r\nransom. In restless mood he declared his intention of going overseas,\r\nand considerable sums were paid for his fitting out; but he never\r\ngot beyond London, where he died shortly after of smallpox. The\r\nParliamentary Committee, then sitting at Kendal, exacted heavy fines\r\nfrom the estate for delinquency. Oppressive taxes too were repeatedly\r\nlevied for the support of the Parliamentary forces and the Scotch\r\narmy. This extraordinary outflow of money, as well as the loans made\r\nto friends, must have materially reduced the wealth of Squire John,\r\nand have left less for the suitors who presently appeared to claim\r\nthe hands of the heiresses.\r\n\r\nNot the Rydal estate alone, but the whole country-side groaned under\r\nthe burden of taxation. It is therefore not surprising that from the\r\nhardness of the times, as well as from possible illwill, the tithes\r\nbegan to yield an uncertain return; and that to come by them at all\r\nit was sometimes necessary to engage a strong man or a stout party\r\nfor the business. An item in the account-sheets for 1645 runs:--\r\n\r\n                                                            li  s  d\r\n\r\n  spent in 3 dayes when we went to gather the tith woole\r\n  being ten in company                                       1  4  0\r\n\r\n  Spent more when Mr. Mason & I went to gather the\r\n  Easter dues at severall tymes                                15  0\r\n\r\n  Oct.

His account-sheets\r\nclose in 1648-9, when the hall--soon to lie under the ban of\r\nsequestration--was itself closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMONWEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1645 marked the beginning of a great change in the church\r\ngovernment of Grasmere. Already the new system devised by the\r\nPresbyterian party (which was now in the ascendant after the success\r\nof the Scotch at Newcastle) was being put into force as a substitute\r\nfor episcopal rule. The division of the country into sections, each\r\ncalled a _classis_--to be administered by a committee of laymen\r\nempowered to nominate for each parish a minister and four elders--was\r\nvery rapidly carried out. The following answer was sent to the\r\nParliament's demand, by letter from the Speaker, that _classes_ for\r\nSouth Westmorland should be formed:--[110]\r\n\r\n  [110] Shaw, in his _Church under the Commonwealth_, says that the\r\n  scheme was already working in Northumberland and Durham at the\r\n  close of 1645, and that it seems to have been put in force in\r\n  Westmorland early in 1646. This letter explains the delay.\r\n\r\n  Honourable Sir\r\n\r\n     We received your Honours letter (dated the 22nd September last)\r\n     the 3d of February last Wherein is required of us with advise\r\n     of Godly Ministers, to returne to your Honour such Ministers\r\n     and Elders as are thought fitt for the Presbiteriall way of\r\n     Government (which wee much desire to be established) and the\r\n     several classes. After wee received your Honours letter to that\r\n     purpose (though long after the date) wee speedily had a meeting;\r\n     and upon due consideration nominated the Ministers and Elders\r\n     which wee thought fitted (as your Honour may conceive by this\r\n     enclosed) for the Presbiteriall imployment as is desired and\r\n     have divided the County of Westmerland into two Classes. Since\r\n     the expediting of this your Honours direction: Wee have heard\r\n     of an Ordinance of Parliament directing to the election of such\r\n     persons: But as yet neither Order or Ordinance hath come unto\r\n     us; Only your Honours letter, is our Warrant and Instruction;\r\n     And accordingly we make bould to send (here inclosed) the names\r\n     both of Ministers and Elders. And if we faile in the Parliaments\r\n     method in this particuler, Wee shall willingly (upon your\r\n     Honours next direction) rectify any mistake for the present,\r\n     and shalbe willing to submitt to your Honours and Parliamentary\r\n     directions; Which wee shall duly expect, that in wharsoever\r\n     wee haved missed, wee may amend it.

These--[111]\r\n\r\n  [111] MSS. Tanner, 60, fol. 527, Bodleian Library, Oxford.\r\n\r\nIn the list of the parishes with their church officials which\r\naccompany this servile epistle, ours appears thus:\r\n\r\n  Grasmere\r\n\r\n     Mr. Henry Wilson, minister of Gressmer a notorious malignant and\r\n     articled against at Parliament.\r\n\r\n     Elders.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Thomas Brathwait     Edward Knotts and\r\n  Michaell Benson          Francis Benson\r\n\r\nThe newly-elected elders were men of good position and character.\r\nMr. Brathwaite, son of Gawen, and grandson of James, was soon to\r\nbecome the head of the Ambleside Hall family. The Bensons were the\r\ndescendants of the rich clothiers of Elizabeth's days. Francis,\r\nliving at his freehold of the Fold, Loughrigg, was later to display\r\nhis indomitable will as a disciple of George Fox. Edward Knott was\r\none of a race of Grasmere statesmen whose course was a forward one\r\nfor some hundreds of years, and whose later history belongs to Rydal\r\nand Coniston.\r\n\r\nBut before these men were chosen, or this letter written, the\r\n\"Committee\" in Kendal had already interfered in church matters in\r\nGrasmere, and had suspended the parson. The Rev. Henry Wilson had\r\nserved the king's cause in other ways than by preaching; and it is\r\nprobable that the sums of money he began to borrow from 1643 from the\r\nRydal Hall estate (whose coffers all the needy Royalists had recourse\r\nto) were used upon journeys to and fro as an emissary, or were\r\nexpended in some other way for the cause.[112]\r\n\r\n  [112] The secret messengers who passed with despatches between\r\n  the king and his army endured great perils and sometimes lost\r\n  their lives.\r\n\r\n                                                           li  s  d\r\n\r\n  Lent to P'son wilson upon his bill & Sr. Chr: Rawlings\r\n  13th of August for 6 weekes or els to Allow in his\r\n  wages at Martinmas                                        1  0  0\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Lent to Mr. Wilson P'son of Gresmire the 16 July\r\n  upon his bill to be allowed in his sty. pd. at martinmas\r\n  next 1644                                                 3  0  0\r\n\r\nBy September he had borrowed £4 more, and on December 30th, £2 10s.\r\nBut the Parliamentary party had by this time determined to put a curb\r\non the Royalist parson's excursions. There exists among the MSS.\r\nof the Corporation of Kendal, a bond, dated November 16th, 1644,\r\nentered into by him to Colonel James Bellingham, \"that the said Henry\r\nWilson shall appear and render his body into the hands of the Provost\r\nMarshall of Kendall, at the end of twenty dayes next after the date\r\nhereof, and in the mean tyme shall not travell forth of the County of\r\nWestmorland nor hold any intelligence nor send any message by word or\r\nwriteing to any of that party now in armes against the parliament,\r\nbut in all things demeane himselfe well, and not indeavour in any\r\nwise to seduce or withdrawe the affections of any of his parishioners\r\nor others from the service of King & Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nAttested by James Bellingham, Thomas Brathwaite, and Thomas\r\nKelver.[113]\r\n\r\n  [113] Communicated by Mr. J. A. Martindale.\r\n\r\nUnder the pressure of military force he was constrained to appear\r\nbefore the Parliamentary tribune at Kendal; and he must have been\r\nthen formally inhibited from duty; for the Rydal account-book shows:--\r\n\r\n                                                          li  s  d\r\n\r\n  pd to Mr. Benson who serues at Gresmire put in by\r\n  the Committee & ordered to pay the stypend to\r\n  him that was due to Mr. Wilson for Halfe A\r\n  yeare ended at penticost last 1645                       9  5  9-1/2\r\n\r\n  pd to mr. benson by an order from the Committee for\r\n  Halfe A yeares wage for serving the Cure at Gresmire\r\n  ended at Martinmas last 1645                             9  5  9-1/2\r\n\r\nIt is singular that in the Committee's report of its action to the\r\nParliament, in the letter already given, it makes no mention of\r\nMr. Benson's supersession of the rector. It was not destined to\r\nstand however; and possibly there was opposition in the parish. For\r\nHarrison enters, under February, 1646:--\r\n\r\n                                                          li  s  d\r\n\r\n  pd. to Sr. Chr: Rawling in pt. of his wages for seruing\r\n  the Cure of Gresmire for Halfe A yeare to end at\r\n  penticost next & either to pay it again or els to\r\n  stand in paymt.                                          5  0  0\r\n\r\nThe remaining £4 was paid on May 22nd, \"by order of the Comittee.\"\r\nIt would be interesting to know who this server of the cure was. He\r\nhad been resident since at least 1641, when a child of his \"Christe:\r\nRawlinge, cler,\" had been baptized. He had likewise joined Parson\r\nWilson in his bill three years earlier. His prefix \"Sir,\" betokened\r\nhim to be of the lower order of clergy, who had not graduated at\r\neither University.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Wilson, without stipend, was sinking under a weight of\r\ndebt. A year after the death of his first wife, he had married (in\r\n1639) Mrs. Dorothy Forrest, and he had (besides a former family)\r\nyoung children born in 1642 and 1643. Harrison thought it necessary\r\nnow, in 1645, to obtain the consent of the young heir of Rydal, and\r\nof another executor, before lending him further sums of money:--\r\n\r\n                                                         li  s  d\r\n\r\n  Lent parson wilson upon his note by & with the consent\r\n  of Mr. Phillipson & Mr. Willm. wch. makes\r\n  that he hath lately lent 8 li wch. he will either\r\n  repay or els giue satisfaction that it may allow\r\n  when he comes & serues the cure at Gressmire\r\n  Church lent him this the 13 July                       5  10  0\r\n\r\nPossibly he left Grasmere for a time, yet it is clear that he had\r\nhopes of recovering his position there. It is noteworthy that the\r\ncurates of St. John's and St. Bride's, Cumberland, borrowed money\r\nabout the same time, and probably for the king's business likewise.\r\n\r\nParson Wilson--for so he was still called--borrowed £2 more in April,\r\n1646, making in all £10, and £5 more in May. This was done by consent\r\nof the executors of the late Squire John Fleming, and he gave them a\r\nbill which terminated on September 29th. He was quite incapable of\r\nmeeting such a bill, and it became necessary to devise a plan for\r\nsecuring repayment.\r\n\r\nNow steps upon the scene a figure destined to play for long a\r\nprominent part in Grasmere church affairs. \"My Cozen Ambrose\" is\r\nmentioned in Harrison's account-book as ordering an additional 15s.\r\nto be paid to parson and clerk on death of Squire John \"for oversight\r\nof his buriall\" and now he took more pronounced action. He was nephew\r\nof Squire John, whose sister Dorothy--his mother--had married the\r\nlord of Lowick. He had been educated for the church, and in 1629 was\r\nelected Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge.[114] From the first\r\nhe was doubtless intended to fill the post of rector of Grasmere,\r\nas the patronage belonged to the family. Truly, the living for the\r\nmoment was worth no more than £18 11s. 7d., the stipend paid by the\r\ntithe-holder; but Gabriel Croft's lease of the tithes was to lapse in\r\n1647, when they would again belong to the rector. So when Wilson was\r\nfound to be in the last straits for money, John Ambrose came forward\r\n(with the lease in view) to adjust matters. Under date January, 1647,\r\nHarrison entered in his book:--\r\n\r\n     pd. to Mr. Wilson P'son of gresmire accordinge to articles\r\n     made betwixt Mr. Wm. and him by doctor Ambrose order for\r\n     delapidations for gresmire Rectorie and for confirmeinge all\r\n     the tythes of Rydall at 20s P' annm. duringe his life upon his\r\n     agrement 24 mch 1646, and a bill 15 li lent money deliuered him\r\n     in, and pd. him this daie more to make up the Some to 22 li 10s,\r\n     set down by doctor Ambrose 7 li 10s 0d.\r\n\r\n  [114] Dr. Magrath's _Flemings in Oxford_.\r\n\r\nThus the broken-down parson was mercifully left in his dilapidated\r\nhouse with his debt cleared, a few pounds in hand, and the prospect\r\nof £1 yearly in lieu of the Rydal demesne tithe, which was the\r\nancient prescription.\r\n\r\nLittle as it was, it was better than nothing, and the incoming of\r\nother tithes to the parson was problematic, even if he were again\r\nallowed to serve the cure. But this doubtful future he had not long\r\nto face. The church register of that year records on June 26th\r\n\"buryall Henry Willson Clerk of Gresmyre.\"\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a doubt that the Rev. John Ambrose was at once\r\nnominated to the post by the Fleming family. In evidence given for\r\nthe Restoration lawsuit over the tithes, it is stated that he had\r\nbeen inducted \"about 15 years since,\" and had kept the office and\r\nofficiated, till ejected by \"the late usurpers.\" The position with\r\ntithes restored to it, was worth a struggle to keep, and the parish\r\nelders and the Presbyterian party at large would seem to have offered\r\nno real opposition to this powerful nominee.\r\n\r\nThat party indeed was losing ground all over England, where a\r\npersonal examination before administration of the sacrament--rigidly\r\nenforced under the Scotch system of eldership--was much disliked;\r\nand by 1649 its control over church affairs was practically at an\r\nend.[115]\r\n\r\n  [115] Shaw's _Church under the Commonwealth_.\r\n\r\nThe successes of the Parliamentary army had besides, after the\r\nvictory of Naseby (1645), brought the Independents into power.\r\nWithout passing a law to annul the Presbyterian scheme, they brought\r\nforward in Parliament various fresh ones of their own; and in 1650\r\na bill was framed for \"the better propagating of the Gospel\" in\r\nNorthumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland and Durham, these counties\r\nhaving petitioned that the vexed question of \"settling ministers\"\r\nmight be finally resolved. The Act was to hold good for three years;\r\nand after a slight extension it was abandoned, as the Commissioners\r\nappointed to carry it out had not given satisfaction. It was while\r\nthe Commissioners under the Act were in office, and no doubt by\r\nthem, that Ambrose, an episcopalian and a Royalist, and nominated\r\nmoreover by a family of recusants, was ejected. In the depositions\r\ntaken at Ambleside, October, 1663, for the tithe lawsuit, John Newton\r\nof Ambleside declared that the ejection took place about Martinmas,\r\n1653; and \"John Wallace of Kendall clerk,\" aged 32, gave evidence\r\n\"that the complainant Ambrosse, by some of the late usurped powers\r\nwas sequestered out of the parish church of Grasmere, sitting at\r\nNewcastle on Tyne before 1653, after which this deponent officiated\r\nin the said cure 1653, 4 and 5; and after he left one John Tompson,\r\nclerk, officiated till complainant was restored. During deponent's\r\nofficiating most of the parishioners paid their tithes to him,\r\nand owned him as patron; and he believes they did the like to\r\nThomson.\"[116]\r\n\r\n  [116] Ex. Deps., 15 Chas. II., Mich. 33, Westmorland.\r\n\r\nWallas was clearly placed in the Rev. John Ambrose's post by the\r\nIndependents, who now--with John Archer at their head--ruled the\r\nmunicipal and religious affairs of Kendal, for the Parliament, by\r\na strong-handed committee; and that it was an ill-judged choice\r\nas well as an ill-favoured one (at least by one section of the\r\ncommunity) is certain. By no religious party should John Wallas have\r\nbeen considered a suitable pastor for the wide and conservative\r\nparish, since he was either a man of low, disorderly life, or\r\nunfortunate in making enemies who could successfully libel him. In\r\n1655 he was summoned before the justices at the Quarter Sessions\r\nupon two charges. One was the attempted ravishment of Clara Barwis\r\nof Loughrigg, \"a virgin\" twenty-two years old, and of this offence\r\nhe was declared not guilty; while the unhappy girl--likewise charged\r\nwith \"ye detestable sinne of fornication with John Wallass Clke\"--was\r\nby an irrational and shameful verdict sentenced to three months\r\nimprisonment for the joint offence. The other charge against him was\r\nan assault upon one John Hird; but as he brought a counter charge\r\nagainst Hird, this disturbance of \"ye publique peace\" must have\r\nassumed the aspect of a free fight.[117]\r\n\r\n  [117] Book of Quarter Sessions Indictments, Kendal Corporation.\r\n\r\nWallas was not long to enjoy unchallenged his position at Grasmere.\r\nThe situation was being watched by one who only awaited opportunity\r\nfor action. It was a time of unrest and seething thought; and in 1651\r\nGeorge Fox, after beholding his vision of blood--when he ran through\r\nthe streets of Lichfield crying \"Woe, woe\"--had begun his wandering\r\nlife as a preacher. The country was swayed to and fro by contending\r\nreligious factions. The more sober and rational-minded among these,\r\nshocked by the confusion that prevailed, formed themselves into\r\n\"Voluntary Associations,\" under which the acting church authorities\r\nof each district--whether Independent or Presbyterian--united for the\r\npurpose of settling (if this were possible) the vexed questions of\r\nthe administration of the sacrament and the ordination of ministers.\r\nAt once an Association was formed for Cumberland and Westmorland,\r\nwhere the success that attended George Fox's first missionary journey\r\nthrough the distracted counties in 1652-3, had brought consternation\r\nto all sections of the Puritan party, and under the leadership of\r\nMr. Richard Gilpin it proceeded to action.[118] Meetings for the\r\nsettlement of church affairs were held every month at Carlisle,\r\nPenrith and Cockermouth, and in 1656 the counties put forth a joint\r\nmanifesto, called \"Articles of Association.\"\r\n\r\n  [118] Fox's _Journals_. He says that he had \"large meetings\" in\r\n  Westmorland.\r\n\r\nIt was the existence of this body with its moderate and conciliatory\r\npolicy, that doubtless enabled the new squire of Rydal to take the\r\nstep he had for some time been preparing. Barely of age in 1654, and\r\nnot yet in possession of the family estates, he nevertheless--while\r\nstudying law in London--kept his eye on the condition of affairs in\r\nGrasmere and sought how he might--if not restore his kinsman Ambrose\r\nto the rectory--at least oust the intruder. An entry in his accounts\r\nof 1s. paid on May 24th \"for ye Parrishioners of Gresmire their\r\nCaveat\" shows that he had secured the support of part of the parish\r\nat least. Again on June 27th he paid 1s. 6d. \"for a cop. of the\r\nRefferees names concerning Wallas.\" Without doubt he was preparing,\r\neven to the co-operation of Mr. Brathwaite of Ambleside Hall, for\r\nthe swift stroke of ejection which was carried through on the eve of\r\nhis own entrance to Rydal by his faithful servant John Banks. John\r\ncommunicated the result in the following letter:--[119]\r\n\r\n  [119] Rydal Hall MSS.\r\n\r\n  Hounoured Sir,\r\n\r\n     I praise God I got saffe to Rydale wth the oxen on Saturday at\r\n     night where I was fforced to staye all night it was so late I\r\n     acquainted the P'ishors that you had sent them word to get a\r\n     minister every Lord's daye till such tyme as you presented one,\r\n     and that the might paye them out off the tythes, but none would\r\n     meddle unless I would goe to the Church and appear wth them soe\r\n     I was fforced either to neglect it or send to Mr. Turner off\r\n     Amblesyd to procure him to goe to preach wch I did And he went\r\n     to your Cousin Bratwhait to aske his advice and leave that he\r\n     might goe, soe he came to Rydale and I went along wth him But\r\n     Wallas seeing us cum almost at the Church went quite away to\r\n     Langdale Chapple whether he intended to goe beffore or noe I\r\n     knowe not But he lefft the Clarke to oppose us who would not\r\n     suffer Mr. Turner to read in the usuall place soe I wished Mr.\r\n     Turner to goe into the pulpit and officiate But the Clark begun\r\n     to read a Chapter and I bid him giue over but he would not soe I\r\n     shutt the booke soe Mr. Turner read a Chappter and sung a psalme\r\n     and begune to preach and when the sermon was done I spoke to\r\n     some of the P'ishoners to procure every Lords daye a minister &\r\n     pay them off theire tithes.\r\n\r\n  Conyston this 11 Feb. 1655.\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servant\r\n\r\n  John Bankes.\r\n\r\nGood John, with the squire's authority at his back and the\r\nco-operation of the Ambleside curate (a Presbyterian no doubt), had\r\nsuccessfully carried the situation through for that day, but his\r\nspirit quailed before it, as did that of the people. Under date\r\nFebruary 18th he again wrote to his absent master:--\r\n\r\n     I should be glad to hear ffrom you iff you have heard anything\r\n     ffrom Oxford or London concerninge the P'sonage of Grasmire,\r\n     ffor wallas keepes the place still and saith he will doe it and\r\n     that he is instructed by Mr. Archer to keepe it til such tyme as\r\n     he present another, And he saith that he will cause Mr Turner\r\n     to be put off his place ffor goeing that one daye to officiate\r\n     there, Sir I desire that you will be pleased iff you heare\r\n     anythinge to lett me knowe that I may encourage the P'ishoners\r\n     ffor the are nowe more dismayed then the were beffore.\r\n\r\nIn a postscript he reverts to the subject:--\r\n\r\n     Sir it will not be amisse to remynd them aboue (probably meaning\r\n     any grandee with whom young Daniel might come into contact\r\n     during his honeymoon visits) concerning Grasmire ffor it is the\r\n     Generall oppinion off all heare that Mr. Archer will doe you a\r\n     preiudice in it iff he can.\r\n\r\nMr. Archer was of course disputing the right of the Rydal squire\r\nto nominate. But he and the Independents were yet to learn the\r\nindomitable nature of the will that now opposed theirs. The young\r\nsquire, too wise to attempt the reinstating of his kinsman, and\r\nassuming the right to nominate, appointed one John Thompson to the\r\nrectory: and he won his way in spite of obstacles placed in it.\r\n\r\n                                                        li  s  d\r\n  10 ber 4, 56.

Thompson, however, kept his post. He may\r\nhave acted in tune with the Presbyterians for the time being, but at\r\nthe Restoration he returned at once to the uses of the re-established\r\nChurch of England. At the Quarter Sessions held at Kendal, September,\r\n1660, William Willson of Langdale was charged with \"disquietinge,\r\nabuseinge, & disturbinge John Tompson Clerk vicar of Gressmire in\r\nreadinge ye booke of comon prayer or service of ye Church & in his\r\ncollaton or preachinge at Langdale Chappell\" on the 26th, \"beinge ye\r\nlord's day\" and the said Willson, refusing to submit or to swear the\r\noath of allegiance, was committed to gaol, with the option of a fine\r\nof 100 marks.[120] Willson indeed was a Quaker or Friend, who abjured\r\nall oaths--a fact at first misunderstood, and which so frequently\r\ncaused their committal on political grounds. He was one of George\r\nFox's most fiery adherents, and a speaker among the little band that\r\nhad sprung up in the parish during the anarchy; and in denouncing the\r\nclergy on their own ground (the \"steeple-house\") he did but imitate\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\n  [120] Book of Indictments, Kendal Corporation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand John Wallas--who had apparently been appointed by\r\nhis friends to another church--was charged before the Justices with\r\nnot reading the Book of Common Prayer, as ordained by law. His next\r\nappearance at court, in 1663, was in connection with the plot against\r\nthe king and government, lately discovered. He was suspected of being\r\nmixed up in it, and was committed to Appleby gaol for three months.\r\n\r\nThe young squire of Rydal, Daniel Fleming, had now a free hand in the\r\ncongenial task of setting the church of Grasmere on the old footing.\r\nThere was some delay or uncertainty, however, in the return of his\r\ncousin Ambrose to the rectory. The church register contains a note\r\nof money collected, August 25th, 1661, and this is signed by John\r\nBrathwaite, \"Rector of Grasmere,\" by John Browk, \"curate,\" and the\r\nchurchwardens; and John Browk's signature as curate occurs again\r\nAugust 7th, 1663. But it is certain that Parson Ambrose soon made\r\ngood his claim to the position of rector, and that John Brathwaite\r\nremained as his principal curate in charge. He was a man who had\r\nseemingly no mind for strife or commotion. He showed supineness in\r\nallowing the squire to conduct the dispute about the tithes which now\r\narose; as well as later to oppose the scheme of the Ambleside folk to\r\nsecure the privileges of baptism and burial for their chapel. On this\r\noccasion the excuse was made of his being then (1674) in residence as\r\nFellow of St. John's, Cambridge.[121] Perhaps he loved too well the\r\ncloistered ease of the University. He never attempted to reside at\r\nthe rectory, and would seem to have arranged for bachelor quarters\r\nto be fitted up at the hall, where he might spend such time as he\r\nthought it necessary to devote to the parish. These entries occur in\r\nthe great account book:--\r\n\r\n  [121] See Cumberland and Westmorland Society's _Transactions_,\r\n  vol. vi., N.S.\r\n\r\n                                                         li  s  d\r\n  Aug. 11. 59.

Spent at Braythey Bridge end in ye\r\n    contest betwixt Jos. Penny & my Cosin Ambrose        00 00 06\r\n\r\nFor the recovery of the tithes, the rector relied entirely on the\r\nlegal knowledge and acute judgment of his relative; and the draft\r\nof the Bill presented in the Court of Exchequer, and now lying at\r\nRydal Hall, is in the latter's handwriting. From this we learn that\r\ncertain parishioners refused to pay tithes to the newly-instituted\r\nrector, and that their refusal was moreover of some years standing,\r\nas neither Wallas nor Thompson had been in a position to compel\r\npayment from the refractory. There are twenty-one names cited in the\r\nbill. Many of these were no doubt conscientious objectors, though\r\nsome would be of that ever-present class, who seize any excuse for\r\nshirking an obligation. From the wording of the petition, that the\r\nobjectors \"pretended\" John Ambrose never was parson of Grasmere,\r\nnor had been lawfully restored, it looks as if there had been some\r\nopposition to the squire's change of minister at the Restoration.\r\nMr. Thomas Brathwaite had assisted him as we have seen in the\r\nremoval of the Independent, but now the expulsion of the (probable)\r\nPresbyterian minister in favour of the Episcopalian roused the ire\r\nno doubt of the Presbyterian party, headed by the Ambleside Hall\r\nfamily. Robert Brathwaite, gentleman, was younger brother of Thomas,\r\nand had inherited from his father Gawen not only the property of\r\nHigh House, Hugill (where he generally resided) but the small\r\n\"manor\" of Baisbrowne in Langdale. It was on this estate that tithes\r\nwere claimed from its owner, who heads the list of recalcitrant\r\nparishioners. Another prominent statesman among them was Christopher\r\nNicholson, of Padmire, Grasmere, of whose religious persuasion we\r\nknow nothing. A third was Francis Benson, freeholder; he, along with\r\nMr. Brathwaite and Michael Benson, had served as an elder on the\r\nPresbyterian _Classis_, and had now become an ardent Quaker. These,\r\nwith the rest, had--so the petition declared--combined to resist\r\npayment, and had persuaded others to do the like. Their position was\r\ncertainly weakened by the fact that they had failed to pay these\r\ncustomary dues for its support, while they were satisfied with the\r\nministry; yet the demand now made for fourteen years' arrears, may\r\nwell have irritated them. The claim upon Mr. Robert Brathwaite's\r\nestate stands thus, when placed in the form of a table:--\r\n\r\n                                                                  £  s. d.\r\n  Meadows, of which the \"tythe-hay\" is worth yearly               0  0 10\r\n  Ten cow's milk each yearly 2d.                                  0  1  8\r\n  One tithe-calf                                                  0  1  8\r\n  Two foals, each 2d.                                             0  0  4\r\n  Three hundred sheep, of which, the tythe wool is worth yearly   2  0  0\r\n  One hundred lambs paying a customary sum each year of 1s. 2d.     11  8\r\n  Three sows, the tithe pigs being yearly                              10\r\n  Ten geese, ten hens, and ten ducks, tithe yearly                   5  0\r\n  two swarms of bees, customary payment 2d. each                        4\r\n  Five bushels of plums, with other fruit, tithe worth               3  0\r\n  Twenty acres, pastured with barren cattle                          5  0\r\n  Hemp grown, tithe worth yearly                                     2  0\r\n  Oblaytions                                                         2  6\r\n\r\nThe demand made upon each of the foremost defendants in the lawsuit\r\nwas exactly the same, showing that the estimate of the tithes was\r\na purely conventional one. It amounted then for each prosperous\r\nstatesman to £3 14s. 10d.--a large sum compared with the commutation\r\nof the Rydal Hall tithe; and when this figure is multiplied by\r\nfourteen for arrears, a total of £52 7s. 8d. is reached, which was\r\nlikely enough to arouse dismay and opposition. The case dragged\r\non; and on October 20th, 1663, a commission sat at Ambleside, when\r\nwitnesses were called on both sides. The smaller statesmen were no\r\nlonger cited, while Robert Brathwaite, Christopher Nicholson, Francis\r\nBenson, and John Benson stood as the defendants.[122] The verdict\r\nis not known; but payment of tithes once more became customary.\r\nThe refusal of the Quakers to pay the church rate will be noticed\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n  [122] Ex. Deps., 15 Chas. II., Mich. 33, Westmorland.\r\n\r\nThe tithes seem often to have been let on lease, which saved the\r\nrector the trouble and annoyance of collection. Edward Benson of\r\nLoughrigg declared, in 1663, before the commission, that he and\r\nMiles Mackereth and John Brathwaite held a lease of them from Parson\r\nAmbrose for three years, which ended April 15th, 1665. About the year\r\n1726 they were apparently farmed by the statesmen jointly. A paper\r\nexists[123] entitled \"Grasmere Tyth Corn lett to the Inhabitants Anno\r\n1726. Some wanting.\" It contains the names of 55 landholders, with\r\nthe amount--varying from 1s. to 18s.--paid by each as an equivalent\r\nfor the tithe of corn. The total is £18 6s.\r\n\r\n  [123] Rydal Hall MSS.\r\n\r\nThis agrees with the statement of Miss Craik, who in 1752 was\r\ncorresponding with Sir William Fleming on behalf of her incapable\r\nbrother, the rector. While expressing her surprise that he should\r\nthink of renting the tithes of corn, she tells him that Mr. Craik's\r\ncollector had been persuaded to grant a three years' lease at £14\r\n10s., which was too little. The salary of the collector, she adds,\r\nhad been in a former year £5.\r\n\r\nThe growth of corn increased seemingly in this district as the\r\neighteenth century went by, owing no doubt to its heightened price\r\nthroughout the kingdom. The tithe of it accordingly went up in value,\r\nwhile wool, from the decay of the cloth trade, went down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCH WARDENS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FONT IN GRASMERE CHURCH.\r\n\r\n(FROM TABLE BOOK BY WM.

No document exists,\r\nprior to the Restoration, that concerns the fabric. It was then\r\napparently the same as it is now. As one steps within the portal,\r\nand sees through the gloom its strange double nave, the rude spaces\r\nbroken through the thick intersecting wall, and the massive, split,\r\nmisshapen timbers that support its roof, one wonders who were its\r\nplanners and builders. Here surely in this strange and original\r\nstructure we see a work conceived and carried out by the very men who\r\nworshipped within it. Sturdy, strong, and self-dependent, they would\r\nseem to have asked little or no aid either in money or skill, for the\r\nrearing and decoration of their church. Yet its builders, when they\r\ncame to remodel, if not to rebuild their ancient place of worship,\r\nmust have known edifices of statelier plan. There was Kendal, their\r\ngreat centre, with a church that must always have kept abreast of the\r\ntime in architectural beauty, and which--from the earliest fifteenth\r\ncentury at least, showed the dressed columns of stone, the soaring\r\narches, and chantried aisles which yet remain. St. Martin's of\r\nWindermere, too, in the next parish, possessed a duly proportioned\r\nnave, chancel, and aisle; and the columns--built though they were of\r\nundressed stone--rose to support a clerestory and the evenly-timbered\r\nroof. Hawkshead again (whither the dalesmen often repaired to market\r\nor fair) owned a church that was ruder than the others, indeed--since\r\nits huge cylindrical piers support circular arches, and the timber of\r\nits roof is rough-hewn--but had a well-proportioned plan for nave and\r\naisles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Window in the South Wall.\r\n\r\nOutside View]\r\n\r\nThese places, it is true, had advantages over Grasmere. Kendal was\r\nin contact with the great world and with the heads of the church,\r\nwho visited it regularly. It had, besides, access to freestone.\r\nWindermere, like Hawkshead, had to let the intractable slate of\r\nthe neighbouring mountains suffice for the main structure: hence\r\nthe great piers without capitals and the plaster finish of their\r\ninteriors. But Windermere had an advantage in its nearness to Kendal;\r\nand Hawkshead in its association with the abbey of Furness, which\r\nwas easily accessible from there. Grasmere, on the other hand, was\r\nprobably ignorant of the beauties of the Abbey Church of St. Mary's\r\nat York, to which it was attached. The church was practically shut\r\nup within the remotest chamber of the mountains, and could only be\r\nreached by 17 miles of bad road from Kendal, over which no wheels\r\ncould travel. But with no freestone near, with only the hard mountain\r\nslate to rive, or the boulders of the beck to gather; without\r\ntraditional skill and with very little hard cash, our builders of\r\nGrasmere proceeded--when need came--to alter and enlarge their\r\nHouse of God by such simple methods as house and barn \"raising\" had\r\nmade familiar to them. Thus we read the story of the structure as\r\nit stands at present, and see that the builders had clearly little\r\nhelp from the outer world. We see, too, that this structure was an\r\nalteration of an earlier one; which was not itself the first, for\r\nthe first stone fane probably replaced a wooden one, either here\r\nor on Kirk How. It was doubtless of that simple oblong form, without\r\nchancel or tower, which was technically known as a chapel,[124] and\r\nof which specimens have remained among the mountains to this day. But\r\nan _ecclesia parochia_, possessed of daughter chapels, could not be\r\npermitted by the higher powers--whether of church or manor--to retain\r\nso lowly a form. The manorial lords may have interested themselves\r\nin its reconstruction, though there is no evidence of the fact. In\r\nany case, it is likely that the Abbey of St. Mary would take the\r\nnecessary steps to bring it up to the requirements of its position,\r\nand of the worship to be conducted within its walls. The visiting\r\nbrother would carry accounts of the remote little church to York; and\r\na monk skilled in architecture could be brought over to plan a new\r\nbuilding, and to direct its construction. The customary model for\r\na small parochial church would be adopted, which allowed a chancel\r\nfor priests officiating at the mass; then a nave without aisles\r\nfor the worshippers, lighted by narrow windows--for before glazing\r\nwas possible the opening had to be guarded from weather by wooden\r\nshutters--and to the west a tower, in which to hang the bells that\r\nshould call the parishioners from far.\r\n\r\n  [124] _Gothic Architecture in England_, Francis Bond, p. 191.\r\n\r\nSuch doubtless was the existing church in its first state, and of\r\nit there may remain the tower, the porch, the south wall, and one\r\nwindow. There are indications that before its enlargement it was more\r\nornate then now. Freestone was used, though sparingly, to emphasize\r\nthe chief architectural points. The opening into the tower, piercing\r\nfour feet of solid wall, has a moulding of freestone (now battered\r\naway) to mark the spring of its slightly-pointed arch; while a\r\nstring-moulding is discernible in the north wall of the nave, which\r\nmay once have accentuated the window heads. The windows--if we may\r\nsuppose the one left between porch and tower to be a relic of the\r\noriginal set[125]--were simple openings finished by an \"ogee\" arch.\r\nThe font may be as old as the window, if not older. Its mouldings,\r\nwhich originally followed the rim and divided the bowl into a\r\nhexagon, are almost obliterated; and though no doubt it suffered\r\nduring the Commonwealth, when it was degraded from its sacred use,\r\nthe damage may not be wholly due to that cause. The freestone used\r\nin the building was unfortunately friable, and must have suffered at\r\nevery alteration--such as the piercing of the north wall by arches,\r\nand the building up of the tower-arch for a vestry. It could not be\r\nreplaced by the remodellers; and they seem to have intentionally\r\nchipped and levelled it, and then freely whitewashed it over, with a\r\ngeneral view to tidiness. They even went beyond this; for when the\r\neast wall was reconstructed in 1851, a stone carved with the likeness\r\nof a face was found built into it. This is now in the Kendal Museum.\r\nThe piscina, too, now refixed (and, unfortunately, redressed), was\r\nfound, covered with plaster, lower down in the same wall.\r\n\r\n  [125] This is almost a certainty. A drawing made by a friend of\r\n  Mrs. Fletcher, of Lancrigg, showed two like windows on the south\r\n  side; but it is unfortunately lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Profile of Stone Head]\r\n\r\nThe worn, maltreated freestone might, if we knew its origin, tell\r\nsomething of the tale of the building. A well-squared yellow block,\r\nrecently laid bare in the porch, is certainly not the red sandstone\r\nof Furness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCULPTURED STONE FOUND IN TAKING DOWN THE EAST\r\nWALL OF GRASMERE CHURCH]\r\n\r\nNow should the age of the fabric, decorated thus simply though\r\njudiciously, be questioned, it must be owned that there is nothing\r\nto indicate its being older than the fourteenth century. It is true\r\nthat a western tower with no entrance from outside was a feature\r\nof many Saxon churches, but such towers continued to be built for\r\nparish churches until a late date. The rough masonry of the Grasmere\r\ntower is due to the material; and the massive boulders used in the\r\nfoundation were no doubt gathered from the beck, whose proximity must\r\nhave been highly convenient for builders who were poorly equipped\r\nfor the quarrying of their slate rock. The \"ogee\" or trefoiled arch\r\nwas a development of the Decorated style of architecture, which\r\nevolved the form from the elaborate traceries of its windows.[126]\r\nThe Decorated style is roughly computated as lasting from the open\r\nto the close of the fourteenth century, and the period of its use\r\ncoincides fairly with the time when our church fell under the\r\ninfluence of the monastery.\r\n\r\n  [126] S. Holborne: _Architecture of European Religions_.\r\n\r\nA church of primitive size would be sufficient for the folk of the\r\nthree townships, while they lived in scattered homesteads and were\r\nall bent upon husbandry, with short intervals of warfare with the\r\nScots. But it would become too small for a growing population that\r\nthrove in times of peace upon the wool trade.[127] With walk-mills in\r\nthe valleys, and families growing rich as clothiers, some extension\r\nof the church would be necessary; and this extension seems to have\r\nbeen started in a fashion strangely simple. Leaving the walls of the\r\nedifice intact with its roof, a space almost equal--for it is but one\r\nyard narrower--was marked off on the northern side, enclosed by walls\r\nand roofed over. The intervening wall could not be removed, because\r\nthe builders were incapable of spanning the double space by a single\r\nroof. It was therefore left to sustain the timbers of the two roofs,\r\nand through its thickness (over three feet) spaces were broken in the\r\nform of simple arches. Thus--though one is called an aisle--two naves\r\nwere practically formed, separated by the pierced wall. The date\r\nof this enlargement is uncertain. If we place it in the era of the\r\nprosperity of the townships from the cloth trade, it could have been\r\ndone no earlier than the reign of Henry the Seventh, and no later\r\nthan the early days of Elizabeth; while a supposition that it was not\r\ntaken in hand until the dissolution of the monastery had thrown the\r\nmen of the three townships on their resources is strengthened by the\r\ncharacter of the work.\r\n\r\n  [127] See Fullers and Freeholders: _Trans. of Cumberland and\r\n  Westmorland Ant. So._, N.S.\r\n\r\nHow long the enlarged church remained under a double roof cannot be\r\nsaid. Trouble would be sure to come from the long, deep valley, where\r\nsnow would lodge and drip slowly inside. Clearly there was urgent\r\nneed for action and radical alteration when the powerful Mr. John\r\nBenson, of Baisbrowne, made his will in 1562. A clause of this runs:\r\n\"Also I giue and bequeath towardes the Reparacions of the church of\r\ngresmyre XXs so that the Roofe be taken down and maide oop againe.\"\r\n\r\nBut how to construct a single roof over the double space? This\r\ninsoluble problem (to them) was met by the village genius in a\r\nsingular manner. The arched midwall was not abolished. It was\r\ncarried higher by means of a second tier of arches whose columns\r\nrest strangely on the crowns of the lower. These upper openings\r\npermit the principal timbers to rest in their old position, while\r\nthe higher timbers are supported by the abruptly ending wall. Thus\r\na single pitched roof outside is attained, sustained by a double\r\nframework within. The result is unique, and remains as a monument of\r\nthe courage, resource, and devotion to their church of our mountain\r\ndalesmen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Since this chapter was written the stone face--p. 104--has been\r\nreturned by Kendal to Grasmere.--ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FURNITURE\r\n\r\n\r\nOf early furniture there is, of course, no trace within the\r\nchurch. All the accessories of the ritual of the mass, whether in\r\nmetal, wood, or textile, as well as such as would be required for\r\nprocessions on Rogation Days, were swept away at the Reformation. A\r\nreminder of these processions may perhaps be found in the field at\r\nthe meeting of the roads near the present cemetery, which goes by\r\nthe name of Great Cross, for here, doubtless, a Station of the Cross\r\nstood where the priest and the moving throng would halt and turn.\r\nAnother field is named Little Cross.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Date on Bench End]\r\n\r\nOne upright piece of oak, roughly cut with the date 1635, remains\r\nto show us the style of the old benches--or forms as they were\r\ncalled--which filled the space above the earthen floor. The bench\r\nitself, to judge by the aperture left in this end-piece, would appear\r\nto have been no more than six inches wide, and almost as thick; the\r\nbench-end, which was further steadied by a slighter bar below, was\r\nsunk into the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENCH END.]\r\n\r\nThese benches could not have been fixed with any permanence, for the\r\nearthen floor was often broken up for the burial of parishioners.\r\nThe custom of burial inside the church was a favourite one, and\r\nwas continued down to the nineteenth century. While the choir was\r\nreserved for the knight or gentleman (and of the former there were\r\nnone within the parish) and for the priest, the statesman was buried\r\nin the nave or aisle; and only\r\n\r\nthe landless man or cottar would be laid in the garth outside.\r\nFrequently in wills the testator expressed his wish to be buried\r\nas near as possible to a deceased relative, or the place where he\r\nhad worshipped. He was in any case buried within the limits of his\r\ntownship's division in the church. In 1563 Mr. John Benson, of\r\nBaisbrowne, who was a freeholder and probably a cloth merchant,\r\ndesired to be buried \"in the queare in the parish church of\r\ngresmire as neare where my wife lyethe as convenientlye may be.\"\r\nAfter the Fleming family of Rydal and Coniston became possessed of\r\nthe advowson, they were many of them--beginning with William the\r\npurchaser in 1600--buried within the choir; though no monument or\r\ntablet exists prior to the one commemorating Sir Daniel's father,\r\n1653. The tithe-paper shows the rate of payment for interment in the\r\nhigher or lower choir. Besides fees paid to the officials of the\r\nchurch, the townships, through their individual wardens, took payment\r\nfor all \"ground broken,\" as the phrase went, within their division,\r\nand the receipts from this source appear regularly in their accounts.\r\nThe usual fee for an adult was 3s. 4d. (a quarter mark), and out of\r\nthis 2d. had to be paid by the wardens for laying the flag. Less was\r\ncharged for children, while women who died in childbirth were buried\r\nfor nothing but the actual cost of the flag-laying. Under the year\r\n1693, when seven parishioners were laid within the church soil, we\r\nread \"& more for the burying of two Women yt. dyed in Childbed in\r\nthe Church00li 00s 04d.\" There were seven burials in 1723, five in\r\n1732, five in 1766, and four in 1773. As late as 1821 Rydal and\r\nLoughrigg buried one inhabitant in the church, and Langdale three. It\r\nis singular that the Grasmere township discontinued the custom before\r\nthe two others, for no interment took place in her division after\r\n1797.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from the wardens' accounts show how frequently\r\nthe floor of the church was disturbed and levelled:--\r\n\r\n                                                      £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n  1674  It. for lying Flags of 2 graves in our third  00  00  04\r\n\r\n  1689  For lying the Grave Flags and mending\r\n        Forms                                         00  00  06\r\n\r\n  1690  All three townships pay for \"lying Flags\r\n        and mending Fourmes.\"\r\n\r\n  1713  For Lying ye Flaggs upon Several Graves\r\n        wh. had fallen in                             00  01  00\r\n\r\n  1728  For mending the Flaggs and Fourms             00  02  02\r\n\r\n  1729  For flagging and Leavelling ye Church\r\n        floor                                         00  00  10\r\n\r\n  1763  Grasmere mende forms and levell flags, 1s. 6d.; Loughrigg\r\n        and beneath Moss the same, 1s. 8d.\r\n\r\n  1772  New flags bought, and extensive work done upon the\r\n        floor, at a total cost of £9 8s. 1-3/4d.: the flagging of the\r\n        \"low end\" not being completed till next year.\r\n\r\n  1774  For \"mending Furmes in Church & a Soal-tree\" 12s. 4d.\r\n        is paid.\r\n\r\n  1782  Grasmere purchases an oak tree for seats in her third,\r\n        13s. 4d., carpenter 13s. 4d.; with a final 11s. 6d. next\r\n        year for repair of the old ones.\r\n\r\n  1783  Loughrigg and beneath Moss proceeds to the same; and\r\n        two new \"Sole-trees\" [foot-rail] with the railing and\r\n        repairing of four forms cost £1 9s. 0d., besides 1s. 8d.\r\n        spent in ale at the public auction of the contract, and 2d.\r\n        for advertisement of same.\r\n                                                           s   d\r\n\r\n  1811  For Levelling Church & mending Windows             1   6\r\n\r\n  1819  To clearing Church of Stones and Rubbish           1   6\r\n\r\n  1828  Outlay unusual.

But in this\r\nconnection it must be remembered that the practice of burying without\r\ncoffins was the usual one until a comparatively recent period.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that plague broke out again and again, that the fragrant\r\nrush was needed for other purpose than warmth, and that fires within\r\nthe church could not have been tolerated.\r\n\r\nThe custom concerning these forms or _ferms_, as locally pronounced,\r\nwas rigid. Every man had a right, as townsman or member of a _vill_,\r\nto a recognized seat within the church, which was obtained through\r\nthe officials of his township. This seat was, of course, within the\r\ndivision of his township. The women sat apart from the men, and even\r\nthe maids from the old wives. So tenaciously was the hereditary seat\r\nclung to, that reference to it may occasionally be met with in a\r\nwill.[128]\r\n\r\n  [128] Edward Forrest, of Ambleside, when providing, in 1637,\r\n  for his younger son (then under age) as a landholder, adds \"and\r\n  it is my mind and will that my said son Richard shall sitt next\r\n  his elder brother Edward in the same forme, and likewise to haue\r\n  another seate for a woman in the other forme, or seate accustomed\r\n  for women.\" This was in Ambleside Chapel, but the custom was\r\n  general.\r\n\r\n  Mr. George Browne possesses a copy of a document drawn up in\r\n  1629, after there had been contention, which gives the order of\r\n  seating in Troutbeck Chapel. As this has not been printed, it may\r\n  be briefly summarized here. A plan accompanies the paper. The\r\n  general order was, for the men to be seated round the chancel,\r\n  and upon a certain number of the front benches on the north side,\r\n  which was free. The women were behind the men, five being placed\r\n  on each form. They paid for their seats, at a diminishing rate\r\n  from the front, the price starting at 20d.--one-eighth of a mark.\r\n  The plan gives the place of every townswoman, and it is expressly\r\n  stated that if there be a young wife in the family as well as an\r\n  old one, she is to take her place on another form.\r\n\r\nSome serious alteration in the allotment of seats was probably made\r\nin 1676, judging from these entries in the wardens' accounts.\r\n\r\n                                                       li  s  d\r\n\r\n  Ittem for Laughrig third for lifting seatts upon\r\n  Church & when ther names was sent in writting        00  2  00\r\n\r\n  Itt. for grasmyre third for ye like                  00  2  00\r\n\r\nThe Squire of Rydal, as soon as the Restoration permitted it, set\r\nto work to furnish that part of the church in which he worshipped\r\nsuitably to the honour and dignity of his family. The family seats\r\nhad before his time long stood vacant, even if they had been ever\r\nregularly used. His predecessor, John, as an avowed Roman Catholic,\r\nhad preferred to pay heavy fines rather than obey the law in the\r\nmatter of attendance at the Communion of the parish church; and there\r\nis little doubt that the mass was celebrated in private for him at\r\nRydal Hall. John's mother, Dame Agnes, may have attended during her\r\nwidowhood; but her husband William, the purchaser of the tithes and\r\npatronage, must--always supposing him to be a good Protestant--have\r\nattended more frequently at Coniston.\r\n\r\nBut Squire Daniel was a pillar of the church as well as of the State\r\nin his neighbourhood, and his accommodation within the building was\r\nframed in view of the fact. The following entry occurs in his account\r\nbook, under July 13th, 1663. The monument referred to is doubtless\r\nthe brass tablet we now see in the chancel, and it appears to have\r\nwaited for its fixing for ten years after its purchase in London:--\r\n\r\n                                                        li  s   d\r\n\r\n  Spent at Gresmer, when ye wainscott seat, & my\r\n  father's monum.t were set up                         00  00  06\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd two days later the bill for the seat was paid. It is not very\r\nintelligible, but reads thus:--\r\n\r\n  Paid unto Christ. Robinson of Kendall (Joyner)        li  s   d\r\n  for 10 yards and foot 2/1 of double wainscott at\r\n  4s P' yard, and yards 4 foot 2/1 of single wainscott\r\n  at 3s P' yard, for a Board, Ledging & knobs in\r\n  all (being for ye seats at Gresmere) ye sum of       03  06  06\r\n\r\nNo doubt this is the fine old pew which still stands between the\r\npulpit and the priest's door of the chancel. In it, for nearly forty\r\nyears, the squire worshipped, with his growing family about him. The\r\nregularity of his attendance is shown by his account book, where\r\nevery collection is entered; and in spite of his frequent ridings on\r\npublic and private business, he never but once (till the close of\r\nthe book in 1688) missed the four yearly communions in his parish\r\nchurch. On that occasion, when Easter Day, 1682, was spent at Hutton,\r\nhe attended a service at Grasmere on the previous Good Friday (held\r\npossibly by his order), at which his Easter offering was given.\r\n\r\n     Given this day (being Good-Fryday) at ye Offertory in Gresmere\r\n     Church for myselfe 5s., for Will, Alice, Dan, Barbara & Mary 5s.\r\n\r\nThe sums given were invariable: 5s. for himself, 2s. 6d. for his wife\r\n(while she lived), and 1s. for each child.[129]\r\n\r\n  [129] For the custom of Easter offerings, see Canon Simmons'\r\n  Notes to _The Lay Folks' Mass Book_, pp. 239-241.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1675 that the sad necessity rose of putting up a monument\r\nto his excellent wife. The brass was apparently cut in London, for he\r\nsent to his Uncle Newman there:--\r\n\r\n     3li 10s. 0d. towards ye paying for my late dear wifes Epitaphs\r\n     engraving in brass.\r\n\r\nThough 2s. 6d. more was paid afterwards.\r\n\r\n     Unto Rich. Washington of Kendall for amending of my late Dear\r\n     Wifes Epitaph in brass.\r\n\r\nWashington, who was entered in 1642 among the \"Armerers Fremen and\r\nHardwaremen\" of Kendal, and was mayor of the city in 1685,[130] was\r\nwholly entrusted with the next family brass; for we find that under\r\ndate February 10th, 1682, he was paid \"for ye Brass & the cutting\r\nof ye Epitaph for my Mother and Uncle Jo. Kirkby, £4 10s 0d which\r\nmy brothers Roger & William are to pay me again.\" But this was for\r\nConiston Church.\r\n\r\n  [130] _Boke off Recorde of Kirkbie Kendal._\r\n\r\nIt was after the squire's second son, Henry, had become Rector of\r\nGrasmere, and by his encouragement, that the church was freshly\r\nbeautified and \"adorned.\" The entry of 1s. paid in 1662 to James\r\nHarrison for \"makeing ye sentences w'in ye church\" shows that\r\nsomething was at once attempted; for it was as imperative that a\r\nchurch should be \"sentenced\" as that the Royal Arms should be put\r\nup, or the Commandments or Lord's Prayer. All these were devices\r\n(expressly enjoined by the sovereign) for covering up the nakedness\r\nof the churches after they had been stripped by the Reformers of\r\nall objects of beauty and reverence, in roods, images of saints,\r\ntapestries, &c., &c.; for Elizabeth and many of her subjects had\r\nbeen horrified at the effect of changes that appeared to rob the\r\nchurches of their sacred character.[131] Frescoes on plaster had, of\r\ncourse, been used from early times as a means of teaching Holy Writ\r\nand Legend to the unlettered folk, and fragments of such pictures\r\nare still to be seen in Carlisle Cathedral. But at the Reformation,\r\nwhen plaster and paint were again resorted to, only the written\r\nword was permitted (with the exception of the Lion and Unicorn);\r\nand the wall-spaces of the churches became covered with texts\r\nand catechisms,[132] which were surrounded or finished by \"decent\r\nflourishes.\"[133]\r\n\r\n  [131] _English Church Furniture_, Cox and Harvey.\r\n\r\n  [132] An unusual catechism, printed in the Rev. E. J. Nurse's\r\n  _History_, may be seen in the parish church of Windermere.\r\n\r\n  [133] So important was this scheme of decoration considered, that\r\n  in the reign of Charles II. the Archbishop of Canterbury gave\r\n  a commission to his \"well-beloved in Christ,\" a craftsman who\r\n  belonged to the \"Art and mysterie of Paynterstayners of London\"\r\n  to carry it out in all those churches of his province where it\r\n  was found wanting.--_English Church Furniture._\r\n\r\nIn its turn the reformed style has disappeared, even in churches\r\npeculiarly suited to it, like those of the Lake District, where the\r\nrough unworkable slate is bound to be covered by a coat of plaster.\r\nDuring recent restorations, however, at both Windermere and Hawkshead\r\nthe sentences were found under coats of whitewash, and they were\r\nin a truly conservative spirit painted in again. Grasmere, weary\r\nof \"mending\" the sentences and whitening round them, finally wiped\r\nthem out in the last century, and substituted the ugly black boards\r\npainted with texts, which still hang between the archways. Fragments\r\nof the old sentences were descried when the walls were recently\r\nscraped and coloured.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1687 that a complete scheme of decoration was carried out\r\nwithin the church, and one James Addison, a favourite decorator in\r\nthe district, was engaged for the purpose. The contract made with him\r\nis preserved in the churchwardens' book:--\r\n\r\n     Mr. Adison is to playster what is needfull & whiten all the\r\n     Quire & Church except that within the insyde of the Arche of\r\n     the steeple to paint the 10 Coman's on the one syde of the\r\n     Quire window & the beliefe & Lordes prayer on the other with 8\r\n     sentences & florishes in the Quire & 26 sentences in the Church\r\n     with decent Florishes & the Kinges Armes well drawn & adorned.\r\n\r\nLater on comes the copy of an agreement in later handwriting:--\r\n\r\n  March the 29th An'o Dom'i 1687.\r\n\r\n     Mem'd. It was then agreed on by and between James Addison of\r\n     Hornby in the County of Lancaster Painter on the one part\r\n     and Mr. Henry Fleming of Grasmer the churchwardens and other\r\n     Parishioners of the Parish aforesaid: That the said James\r\n     Addison shall and will on this side the first day of August\r\n     next after the date hereof sufficiently plaster wash with\r\n     Lime and whiten all ye church of Grasmer aforesaid (except ye\r\n     inside of the steeple) and well and decently to paint ye Tenne\r\n     Commandm'ts, Lord's prayer and thirty Sentences at such places\r\n     as are already agreed on together with the Kings Arms in proper\r\n     colours and also to colour the pulpit a good green colour and\r\n     also to flourish the Pillars and over all the Arches and doors\r\n     well and sufficiently, the said Parson and Parishioners finding\r\n     lime and hair onely. In consideration whereof the sd. Parson and\r\n     Parishioners doe promise to pay him nine pounds Ten shillings\r\n     when or so soon as the work shall be done.\r\n\r\n     And be it likewise remembered the s'd Parson and Parishioners\r\n     gave him 05s in earnest and that the Parson is to pay the fifth\r\n     part of the nine pounds Ten shillings, the parishioners being at\r\n     the whole charge of the lime and Hair.\r\n\r\n              The names of the 18 Questmen\r\n\r\n  For Grasmer          For Langdale        Rydal Ambleside and\r\n                                             Loughrigg.\r\n\r\n  Reg.

It was a plain structure of wood, and the \"Quission\"\r\nbought for it in 1661, as well as the cloth then procured for the\r\nCommunion Table, were doubtless worn out; for we learn from the\r\nchurch-wardens' Presentment for 1707 that these and some other\r\npoints about the church had been found wanting by the higher church\r\nauthorities. The paper runs:--\r\n\r\n     The defects found in our church for and at ye late Visitation,\r\n     viz. The Floor of the Church-porch & Isles uneven Flagg'd; The\r\n     South wall of the Inside fro' ye Bellfry unto ye East, dirty;\r\n     A decent Reading-pew, Com'unio'-Table-cloth of Linen, & pulpet\r\n     Cushio' wanting; A Table of degrees wanting, & a crackt Bell.\r\n\r\n     All these faults except two (viz. The Reading-pew & crackt Bell)\r\n     are amended. The porch & Isles even Flagg'd. The Wall made\r\n     white & clean, A decent Table-cloth, Pulpet-Cushion, & Table of\r\n     degrees, procured.\r\n\r\n     A new Reading-pew is in making at present, & will shortly be\r\n     perfected. & as for the Bell it was referr'd to Dr. Fleming's\r\n     discerec'on to be amended & made tuneable; & he resolves in\r\n     convenient time to call together & consult w'th the chief of his\r\n     Parishion'rs to do it, & in w't time and manner, to the best\r\n     Advantage.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly we find entries of the expense incurred by a few of these\r\nrequirements:--\r\n\r\n                                                            li   s   d\r\n  1706   For Cloth, Silk, Fring and Tassles for ye pulpitt\r\n           Cushion                                         01   02  05\r\n\r\n         For Flocks harden and making ye pulpitt\r\n           Cushion                                         00   03  01-1/2\r\n\r\n         For Cloth for ye Table Cloth and makeing          00   05  11\r\n\r\n  1709 For mending the Stairs and laying ye Flaggs\r\n         in ye Clarks pew                                   00  10  00\r\n\r\nNothing is heard, however, of a new reading-pew, and in 1710 the old\r\none was mended at a cost of 1s. 8d. The bells, as we shall see, had\r\nto wait.\r\n\r\nNot until a hundred years later was a vestry thought of. In 1810\r\nThomas Ellis was paid 7s. for planning it, and George Dixon £12 2s.\r\n1d. for its erection. It is said to have been made of wood, and\r\nsimply partitioned off the north-west angle of the church. It was\r\nfitted with a \"grate,\" that cost with carriage 19s.; and this being\r\nset on the side nearest to the pews, diffused what must have been\r\nbut a gentle warmth through the edifice. It is the first heating\r\napparatus that we hear of, and the expenses for charcoal and wood,\r\nwith 3s. paid annually to the clerk for setting on the fire, were\r\nsmall. Tradition says that while George Walker lighted the vestry\r\nfire he rang the eight o'clock bell--a call to matins which had\r\nsurvived the Reformation, and the service then abolished.[135]\r\n\r\n  [135] _Mediæval Services in England._ Chr. Wordsworth. Tradition\r\n  from Edward Wilson.\r\n\r\nTime brought other improvements. The harmony of a church choir\r\nentailed its special expenses. In 1812 the ladies of Rydal Hall,\r\nwidow and heiress of Sir Michael Fleming, provided \"Psalmody\" for\r\nGrasmere church at a cost of £2 2s., and for Langdale at £1 1s.\r\nProbably the price of this early tune-book was one guinea. A charge\r\nof 7s. 6d. appears in 1829 for a new pitch-pipe. A \"singing school\"\r\nwas started, causing considerable expense in candles (12s. in 1844).\r\nEdward Wilson fitted the \"singing pews\" with drawers in 1851. There\r\nwas apparently no instrumental music in the Grasmere choir, though\r\nthere may have been in Langdale chapel to judge from an item of\r\nexpense for violin strings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Pitch Pipe]\r\n\r\nMany odd expenses are noted in the accounts, as well as the\r\nreplenishing of worn books and garments. A large Common Prayer Book\r\ncost in 1692 13s. 6d., and another in 1733 14s. Prayer Books began,\r\ntoo, to be supplied in the body of the church; the townships buying a\r\nfew at a time, at a price varying from 6d. to 1s. In 1808 a new Bible\r\ncost £2 2s., while the price of a large Prayer Book in 1823 was £2\r\n5s., and another in 1835 £1 12s.\r\n\r\nThe \"surp-cloth,\" \"surpless,\" or \"surplice\" was renewed at various\r\nprices. After the marvellously cheap one of 1661 (5s.; surely the\r\nproduct of the valley, in flax-growing, spinning, and weaving),\r\nothers were got in 1697 for £1 12s., in 1730 for £1 11s. 4d., in 1734\r\nfor £2 7s. In 1755 a new one is set down at the modest sum of 1s.\r\n5-3/4d., which, if multiplied by three, is barely 4s. 6d.; and in\r\n1775 one (or perhaps the same) was altered for 1s. An amusing item\r\nappears in the receipt columns of the three townships in 1795, when\r\nthey sold the old surplice and divided the amount. \"By 1/3 of the\r\nOld Surplice 2s. 7-1/2d.\"\r\n\r\n\"Communion Linnen\" cost in 1823 14s. 6d. In 1820 a surplice cost £2\r\n18s. 4d., and in 1830 £1 17s. 9d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UPKEEP OF THE CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe one document that exists concerning the fabric of the church and\r\nof its upkeep was written as late as 1661, when the Episcopal Order\r\nof church government was restored.[136] There is every probability,\r\nhowever, that in substance it merely reinstitutes an old custom. The\r\ndocument is printed here:--\r\n\r\n  [136] Rydal Hall MSS.\r\n\r\n     A true Cattollogue made the twenty-first day of Apprill in\r\n     the 13th yeare of the Kings Ma'tyes reigne in the yeare of\r\n     our lord god 1661 by the eighteene men Appointed for the good\r\n     of the parish church of Gresmyre whos names are here under\r\n     written that is to say what particulars both of the church &\r\n     church-yard-wall;

Each township by a common agreement made\r\nitself responsible for the maintenance of a particular portion of\r\nthe church, not only of the fittings, but of the walls and windows\r\nof the fabric, as well as of the garth outside, with the garth wall\r\ndown to its own particular gate of entrance.[137] There were besides\r\ngeneral charges, along with the expenses of the Sunday worship,\r\nin which all took an equal share. Such an undertaking--both joint\r\nand individual--may seem to a merely modern mind a complicated\r\nbusiness, especially as the church consisted structurally of two\r\nparts, which had to be divided for purposes of finance into three.\r\nBut such problems were as nothing to men whose farmholds belonged to\r\na township (indivisible in itself) that was broken up into several\r\nlordships, and whose land--though permanent in quantity--was every\r\nyear freshly apportioned within the common fields of his _vill_. The\r\nsubsequent accounts of the churchwardens, of which a few have already\r\nbeen given, prove that the obligations incurred by this document were\r\nrigidly fulfilled.\r\n\r\n  [137] The churchyard wall at Milburn, Westmorland, is still\r\n  divided for purposes of repair amongst certain inhabitants and\r\n  property-owners, who speak of their share as _dolts_ (Old Norse\r\n  _deild_, a share, from _deila_, to divide). _Transactions_,\r\n  Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian Society, vol. 9, p. 297.\r\n\r\nThe division of the fabric amongst the townships was made on the\r\nfollowing lines. The care of the chancel, with its four windows and\r\ndoor, fell, of course, to the recipient of the tithes--who at this\r\ntime was the rector. The township of Grasmere undertook to repair\r\nthe south wall of the church from the chancel door to the tower, and\r\nhalf the aisle. The benches between this wall and aisle were all\r\napportioned to the folk of the township, as well as a few odd ones\r\nin other parts of the church. The windows for which Grasmere was\r\nresponsible were not, as would naturally be supposed, those of the\r\nsouth wall, but three in the north wall nearest to the east.\r\n\r\nLangdale's share was wholly on the north side. Between the north\r\nwall, which it was bound to repair, and the aisle, stood the forms\r\non which the folk of that valley were seated. The windows specially\r\napportioned to its care were the one in the east wall of the\r\nnorthern half of the church (whose precincts were called the Langdale\r\nchoir) with the two in the north wall next to it.\r\n\r\nRydal and Loughrigg (in which township Ambleside above Stock was\r\njoined for church matters) was responsible for the three windows in\r\nGrasmere's south wall and for the porch. The forms for this portion\r\nof the parish were apparently set in the middle of the church, on\r\neither side the central arched wall.\r\n\r\nThe churchyard wall also was divided among the townships: Grasmere\r\ntaking the north-eastern portion, with the lych gates; Langdale the\r\nstretch onward to the tower, with its own gate (now closed), which\r\nwas opposite Church Stile, or Kirk Steel, then an inn; and Rydal and\r\nLoughrigg the stretch beyond to the south, past the present gate,\r\nwhich was reserved at that time for the folk of the township.\r\n\r\nEach township had clearly its own quarter of the churchyard as well\r\nof the church, wherein to bury its dead. Within, the portions were\r\nmarked by the position of each township's seats, and without, by the\r\ngates. The field apportioned to Langdale, by Harrison's inn, was no\r\ndoubt used for the tethering of horses from that distant valley.\r\n\r\nThe three townships jointly attended to the upkeep of the tower, the\r\nbells, the roof of the church, the pulpit, and church furniture.\r\n\r\nWhen the regulations for church repairs were thus solemnly written\r\nout, there was urgent need for them. Neglect and ill-usage had\r\nreduced the fabric to a forlorn state, and the accounts of the\r\nwardens (who, however, went cautiously to work on renovation) show\r\nwhat was immediately required for setting the place in decent order\r\nand reinstituting the services and sacraments of the established\r\nchurch. From the sum paid to the \"glasser\"--6s., for glazing only\r\nGrasmere's share of the windows--it would seem that the winds of\r\nheaven had blown freely through the building. The font, which was\r\nalways displaced by the Puritans, and often maltreated, required\r\nmending in the stone part as well as the lead; and a new cover was\r\nprocured. A table-cloth--presumably of linen--was bought for 1s.\r\n4d., a bottle (for the wine?) for 3s., a surplice for 1s. 8d., and a\r\npulpit cushion for 2s. 2d.\r\n\r\nThe binding of the Bible next year cost 1s. It had undoubtedly had\r\nhard wear during the diverse ministrations of the Interregnum. It may\r\nhave been the very book bandied about on that Sunday of 1655 when\r\nJohn Banks and his attendant minister were defied by the clerk, and\r\nJohn, upon that official's persistence in reading aloud a chapter\r\nfrom its pages, forcibly closed it, and handed it to Mr. Turner. Also\r\na Book of Common Prayer was got for 1s. 6d., a sum so small as to\r\nraise a doubt of its newness. The large sum of £1 1s. was expended\r\non \"makeing up ye raills in ye quire,\" which shows that this guard\r\nto the space about the communion table (often maliciously broken by\r\nzealots) was in a bad state. The rails were entirely renewed, and a\r\nfresh table made in 1755; and it is interesting to note that they\r\nwere constructed on the spot by joiners brought from a distance,\r\nno doubt Kendal. The wood was procured in Rydal, at a cost of £4\r\n12s., with carriage 2s. 6d. Other expenses, in iron-work, turning\r\n\"bannisters,\" glue, &c., with the boarding of the men, came to £2 1s.\r\n0-1/2d. No doubt the existing rails are those then made, with the\r\nlittle table now used as a credence table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Altar now used as a Credence Table]\r\n\r\nAn object within the chancel is older than these. It is a box\r\ncarved with the date 1648 and the words \"S. Oswaldus Poor Box.\" It\r\nis strange that this object should be acquired at a time when the\r\ncountry was at strife and the church disestablished--unless, indeed,\r\nit was the gift of a rich parishioner like Mr. Thomas Braithwaite\r\nof Ambleside Hall, who was elder of the parish during the rule of the\r\nPresbyterians.[138]\r\n\r\n  [138] The family employed carvers about this time for their\r\n  houses and elaborate mantelpieces.\r\n\r\nThe placing of the King's Arms within the church was obligatory.[139]\r\nThis was a costly business, for two men, who brought the painted\r\npanel, had to be boarded in the village. Some of the money went,\r\nhowever, in drink, and the occasion was evidently made an excuse for\r\nvillage jollity.\r\n\r\n  [139] This was removed from Baisbrowne, and is now at Water Park,\r\n  Coniston.\r\n\r\nGradually other articles customary in a properly-appointed church\r\nwere acquired. A table-cloth--this time probably of cloth--was bought\r\nin 1665 at a cost of 16s. 7d., and \"A cloth to Cover ye Ellements\" at\r\n2s. followed in 1672. The Communion vessels in use up to this time\r\nmust have been of the rudest description, for those that replaced\r\nthem in 1670 were of simple pewter, except the \"dubler\"--doubtless a\r\nplate for the collection of alms.\r\n\r\n                                                        li   s   d\r\n\r\n  Itt for A pewder dubler & pewder cup & a london\r\n  plater                                                00   4   6\r\n\r\n  Itt. for a wood dubler                                00   00  3\r\n\r\nThe accounts show no further expenditure on this score, except for\r\nthe repair of a \"Flagon\" (3d.) in 1708, and for \"Sodering ye Tankers\"\r\nin 1726. The existing plate was supplied by private piety, as its\r\ninscriptions tell. The two silver cups bear the date 1714, and they\r\nare of the same pattern; but one carries the cross with sacred\r\nmonogram and the legend \"The Parish Church Plate of Grasmere Renewed\r\nAo. Doi. 1714\" (having been probably bought from the proceeds of\r\nthe sale of the older plate or by collected offerings), while the\r\nother with a coat of arms inside its border, bears the inscription:\r\n\"The gift of Mrs. Dorothy Benson of Coat How to the Parish Church\r\nof Grasmere Ao. Doi. 1714.\" This lady, wife of Thomas Benson,\r\nfreeholder, of the homestead by the Rothay, gave also a beautiful\r\nold silver alms dish, said to be a piece of Dublin plate.[140] The\r\ndate on this is 1729. She gave a silver paten also, on which only the\r\nmaker's date (1731-2) is engraved. It is singular that each of the\r\nthree pieces displays a different coat-of-arms.[141]\r\n\r\n  [140] Old church plate of the Diocese of Carlisle.\r\n\r\n  [141] See Fullers and Freeholders.\r\n\r\nMrs. Benson's munificence was clearly felt by the parish, for the\r\nitem in the accounts of 1729 \"For Wine given as a Present to Mrs.\r\nBenson,\" 8s., must have been intended as an acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nAnother offering of plate was made much later (1852) by Mrs. Letitia\r\nLough, a friend of the Wordworths, who resided for some time at Fox\r\nGhyll, and later removed to Grasmere.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Communion vessels of the Restoration period,\r\nit must be borne in mind that there was far less use for them then\r\nthan now. The sacrament was at that time administered only four times\r\nin the year. This fact is not only shown by the accounts of the Rydal\r\nHall agent and of the churchwardens, but it is expressly declared by\r\none of the answers made by the wardens at the Presentment of 1723.\r\nThey add that they provide fine white bread and good wine for the\r\nsacrament \"att ye charges of ye Inhabitants\"; and four years later\r\nthey append to this statement \"Easter excepted, which is at the\r\nCharge of the Parson.\"\r\n\r\nThus on three occasions--Christmas, Whitsuntide, and Michaelmas--the\r\nchurchwardens and the Eighteen were bound to provide bread and\r\nwine;[142] while the expenses of the Easter celebration were borne\r\nby the rector, who received the Easter dues. When the tithes were\r\nleased to laymen, this layman took over the charge. And as Squire\r\nJohn Fleming held the tithes, items for this expenditure are found in\r\nTyson's and Harrison's account-books.\r\n\r\n  [142] Is it possible that this custom may be referred to the\r\n  ancient one of the Anglo-Saxon race which thrice in the year\r\n  enforced the attendance of the markmen, unbidden, at a great\r\n  religious rite, for which the sacrifices were provided at the\r\n  cost of the whole district? See Kemble's _Saxons in England_.\r\n\r\nIn 1632 6-1/2 gallons of wine were procured \"against Easter\" for\r\nGrasmere church, at a cost of 13s.; and the Easter bread (fine\r\nwheaten bread as has been said, much relished by people whose staple\r\nfood was oatmeal), with the charge for procuring it, amounted to 10d.\r\nIn 1643 8 gallons were got in for the same purpose, costing £1 1s.\r\n8d.; and next year 9 gallons, at £1 4s.--that is to say, some 4-1/2\r\ndozen bottles of our present size were drunk on this occasion. The\r\nwine cost 4d. to 5-1/2d. a bottle.\r\n\r\nThe amount of wine drunk by the parishioners seems large, even\r\nwhen we remember that the whole of the adult population in the\r\nthree townships were bound to attend, and did attend these solemn\r\nfunctions. Of this there is proof, for every non-communicant was\r\ntaxed, as existing Subsidy Rolls show. It is probable that when\r\nreceiving the wine, the parishioner took a hearty drink from the cup,\r\nand not a sip as at present.[143]\r\n\r\n  [143] About 1634 George Methwen, curate of Bamburgh, was summoned\r\n  before the Court of High Commission for drunkenness and other\r\n  misdemeanors, in the evidence this appears: \"At Easter gone\r\n  twelve monethes at Easter last, examinate (the witness) did\r\n  receive the Holie Communion, and Methwen, when he did distribute\r\n  the wine, did holde the same in his owne hand and would not\r\n  deliver it into examinate's handes for to drinke, as he thinketh\r\n  he ought to have done; for examinate in regard to his holdinge\r\n  on it in that manner, could scarcelie taste of the wine. Methwen\r\n  did serve some others at that time in the like manner, whoe tooke\r\n  offence thereat.\"--_History of Northumberland._\r\n\r\n  It is possible, of course, that not all the wine was drunk,\r\n  but passed to an official as a perquisite. See Cox's _Parish\r\n  Registers of England_, p. 227.\r\n\r\nThe churchwardens' accounts for bread and wine at the three\r\ncommunions are accurately recorded after the Restoration, as well as\r\ntheir expenses for the journey required to procure them--the ride to\r\nKendal being charged as 8d., or if only to Ambleside 4d. Unluckily,\r\nhowever, only the sum expended is given, and not the amount of wine.\r\nIn 1666 the three sacraments cost the parish 9s. 9d., 9s. 3d., and\r\n9d. 3d. respectively; in 1668, 6s. 11d., 8s. 3d., and 8s. 3d.; in\r\n1669, 10s. 3d., 10s. 3d., and 7s. 9d. From 1681 the accounts kept\r\nseparately for Grasmere and for Loughrigg with Rydal each show an\r\nexpenditure for bread and wine; but the Langdale division, which had\r\nnow acquired the privilege of a Communion in its own chapel once a\r\nyear, was apparently let off. The expenses for that year were set\r\ndown as £1 13s. 3d.; Grasmere paying £1 0s. 1d. and Loughrigg and\r\nRydal 13s. 2d.; the division being based probably upon the number\r\nof communicants in each township. In 1691 the total expenditure\r\nwas £2 6s. 6d., and it remained at much this figure till 1729. The\r\ncharge from that time became a fixed one, Grasmere paying 7s. 2d.,\r\n6s. 6d., and 7s. 2d. for the Christmas, Whitsuntide, and Michaelmas\r\ncelebrations (which included two journeys); and Loughrigg and Rydal,\r\n4s. 4d., 5s., and 4s. 4d. (one journey), and it remained at these\r\nfigures till 1821, when there was a change of rectors. From this\r\ndate the charge was exceedingly irregular, figuring occasionally as\r\nhigh as £2 7s. 10d., while sometimes it does not appear at all, the\r\nbread only being accounted for. Then it dropped greatly. From 1833\r\nLoughrigg and Rydal ceased to pay--in consideration, no doubt, of the\r\ncelebrations held in the new chapel in Rydal; and Grasmere figured at\r\na sum under £1, or not at all! By a new arrangement in 1842 Loughrigg\r\nand Rydal recommenced its contribution, though on a new basis of\r\nirregular payments; and this continued until the break-up of the old\r\norder in 1857, when it joined for the last time at the sacramental\r\nbread and wine provided at the old parish church, paying 4s. 9d.,\r\nwhile Grasmere paid 14s. 3d.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to note that with the new order and the new\r\nrector (who kept a book in which he entered particulars of the\r\ncommunicants) the bread and wine for Grasmere alone cost £2 5s. 9d.\r\nWhen, in 1860, it rose to £4 10s., the sum included 8s. paid by the\r\nrector to the wardens in place of his Easter provision. This ancient\r\nrectorial charge is mentioned for the last time in 1865. It was\r\nprobably coincident also with the appointment of the Rev. Fletcher\r\nFleming, that the old order of sacraments four times in the year was\r\nchanged to a monthly celebration.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from the accounts, besides others interspersed\r\nin the text, show that the townships carried out their separate\r\nobligations until the Vestry revolution of 1856-7, a period of almost\r\n200 years. They apparently gave out their share of the work to their\r\nown townsmen. John Birkett, who received 1s. for a \"yeat stoop,\" in\r\n1755, for the Loughrigg and Beneath Moss Gate, was a Rydal man. The\r\nale charged 1s. 8d. in the public auction, when that township let the\r\ncontract for the repair of its benches in 1783, was doubtless drunk\r\nat the Fleming's Inn in Rydal, where such scenes were frequent.\r\n\r\n     1667 to John Hawkrigg for mending gresmyr-yeat 1s 4d\r\n\r\n     1668 for glassing one window for gresmyr 3s 6d\r\n\r\n     1669 It. to Milles Mackereth for a Gammer & Crake & loupp to\r\n     gresmyre Church yeats 1s 9d.\r\n\r\n     1670 for mending sliper of our Church yeats 1d\r\n\r\n     1678 For langdall yeat & laughrigg yeat for Irron-worke 6d; also\r\n     \"for mending Churchyard wale for laughrigg third\" 1s 6d.\r\n\r\n     1680 Loughrigg and beneath Moss repaire \"our window\" 1s 0d\r\n\r\n     1683 Grasmere repairs windows, 8d., \"yeats\" 1s. 0d., and Lou. &\r\n     b.

It is interesting to note how extremely small these\r\nexpenses were. The cleaning, or \"dressing,\" as it was called, of the\r\nchurch, the greasing of the bells, the washing of the linen, the\r\nwriting of the register, the whipping of dogs out of church, and the\r\n\"drawing\" of the accounts, all appear to have been paid for at the\r\nRestoration at the rate of 1s. each per annum. This moderate fee was\r\npresently raised to 1s. 6d., 2s. 6d., 3s., or 3s. 6d., but never rose\r\nhigher for over a hundred years. The \"surpcloth and table-cloth\" were\r\nwashed twice in the year 1662 for 1s., but from 1664 onward three\r\ntimes were allowed for 3s., and by 1702 the laundress had secured\r\nan additional 6d. for mending. The cleaning of the windows \"and\r\nsentences\" (which were presumably touched up with paint) became a\r\nregular charge at 1s., and the burnishing of the church plate was 6d.\r\n\r\nBut there were other expenses, belonging to the general charge,\r\nwhich, being irregular but frequently recurrent, were troublesome to\r\nthe wardens and Eighteen, whose business it was to lay such a rate\r\nannually on the inhabitants of the parish as should cover the outlay.\r\nSuch was the repair of the church roof, which was often needed; even\r\nthe moss (which it was the custom to stuff within the rigging to\r\narrest and absorb the wet which ran down from the ill-fitting slates)\r\nrequired frequent replenishing. Accordingly, after sundry payments\r\nmade for \"mossing church\" or \"mending slates,\" the Eighteen entered\r\ninto a contract, in 1686, with two Grasmere wallers for the upkeep\r\nof the whole of the church roof, except the choir, for nine years,\r\nfor the sum of 7s. 6d. a year. In 1704 one William Grigg obtained\r\nthe contract for three years at the same rate, and undertook to keep\r\nthe roof in a sound state \"as to Slatt and Moss (excepting upon\r\nextraordinary Storms whereby the roof shall suffer much Damage which\r\nshall be referred to the Eighteen the Easter following).\" Grigg,\r\nhowever, made no bad-weather demands, and it was only in 1714, a\r\nyear after the contract had been transferred to Edward Hird, that \"a\r\nviolent storme\" caused the spending of 18s. beyond the stipulated 7s.\r\n6d. The parson and Eighteen then (1715) transferred the contract to\r\nStephen Haukrigge. The sum was perhaps too small, for in 1718 John\r\nWarriner secured 8s. 6d. on the contract. \"An extraordinary Storme\"\r\nin 1719 cost only an extra 3s. The contract, which afterwards rose\r\nto 11s. 6d., had ceased by 1732, and odd sums for repair occur from\r\ntime to time, such as 13s. in 1733 and the same in 1734, with 3s.\r\n3d. for slates and carriage. But little was apparently done, and by\r\n1809 the roof seems to have been in a bad condition, for the ominous\r\nitem occurs \"To cleaning Snow out of Church 2s. 0d.\" It was radically\r\nrepaired in 1814, when £37 1s. 11d. was spent on the slates, £11 on\r\ntimber, which was paid to Lady Fleming, the wood being doubtless\r\nfelled in Bainriggs, and the extraordinary sum of £1 13s. 6d. on ale\r\nto the workmen and \"letting\" the contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BELLS.\r\n\r\nGrasmere's pleasant chime of three bells is undoubtedly an old one.\r\nThe metal of the existing bells that sends its resonance through\r\nthe vale may be that of the first bells, though robbed of antique\r\ninscription or mark by recasting. It is quite possible that at the\r\nRestoration there still hung in the tower the Pre-Reformation triad,\r\nstamped with an invocation to some saint in Longobardic characters or\r\nwith a quaint inscription in Black Letter; for the Rev. H. Whitehead\r\ndiscovered in Cumberland many an ancient bell that had escaped\r\nconfiscation and the melting-pot in the dark days of Henry VIII.'s\r\nruthless robberies and his successor's drastic commission.[144]\r\n\r\n  [144] 7 Ed. VI., 1553. See _Transactions_, Cumberland and\r\n  Westmorland Antiquarian Society, vols. 6 and 14.\r\n\r\nThey were then, however, in a bad state, and the churchwardens\r\nimmediately proceeded to have them set in order, as the accounts show.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the items that one of the wardens, Michael Knott,\r\nrode to Cockermouth in search of a bell-founder, and that one was\r\nprocured whose name was John Langsha; also that he came over to\r\nGrasmere and did the work there.\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Whitehead considered that there was no bell-foundry in\r\nCockermouth at this date. When its three bells were recast in\r\n1673-4 the expenses of the bell-founders' journey were paid, and\r\nthey apparently dug a pit in the churchyard and cast the great bell\r\nthere.[145] Such a method was resorted to when the remoteness of the\r\nchurch or the badness of the roads made the carriage of the bells a\r\ndifficulty.[146]\r\n\r\n  [145] _Church Bells of Cockermouth. Translations_, vol. 14, p.\r\n  295.\r\n\r\n  [146] _Bells of England_, J. J. Raven, p. 190.\r\n\r\nWho, then, was John Langsha? Until more evidence is forthcoming we\r\nmust suppose him to have been an itinerant founder. He or the firm\r\nhe worked for may have had head-quarters in some town of Cumberland,\r\nand travelled thence to wherever they were called. According to\r\nMr. Whitehead, there was a bell-foundry of some repute at Penrith\r\nin the seventeenth century. The account books do not show how this\r\nrenovation of the Grasmere bells was paid for. The wardens paid\r\nJohn his \"earnest,\" and a small item that remained after he left;\r\notherwise the only sum of consequence that appears is 9s. for two new\r\nbell-ropes.\r\n\r\nOnly casual expenses in connection with the bells are given after\r\nthis for some time. For instance, in 1669 the item occurs, \"in drinke\r\nwhen we did turne midlmost bell,\" 2s. 6d. But the presentment of 1707\r\ncertainly discloses the serious condition of one bell, which was\r\nthen cracked; and the reliance of the wardens on the \"discretion\" of\r\ntheir rector was misplaced, as nothing was done. There would seem to\r\nhave been no good founder at this time in the adjacent counties; for\r\nwhen the bells of Brigham were renewed in 1711, under the incumbency\r\nof Roger Fleming (another son of Sir Daniel), a Gloucester firm of\r\nfounders was actually called to the rescue. The bells, however, went\r\nno further than Kendal, where there was, adjacent to the church,\r\na bell-house which could be hired, and there the Gloucester man\r\nsuperintended the casting of them.[147]\r\n\r\n  [147] \"Church Bells of Brigham,\" _Transactions_, Cumberland\r\n  and Westmorland Antiquarian Society, vol. 14, p. 283. It seems\r\n  strange that there was no reliable bell-founder in Kendal, where,\r\n  in the seventeenth century, there was a goodly number of workers\r\n  in metal. (See _Boke off Recorde_.) Of these the Washingtons were\r\n  apparently the most accredited workmen. A Richard of the name\r\n  \"besydes Kendal\" at the Dissolution, bought the house of the\r\n  Friars in Penrith, with its bell. (_Transactions_, Cumberland and\r\n  Westmorland Antiquarian Society, vol. 6, p. 435.) The Richard\r\n  of the next century was busy with arms during the Civil Wars,\r\n  and worked for Rydal Hall. Mr. R. Godfrey (\"Westmorland Bells,\"\r\n  _Transactions_, Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian Society,\r\n  vol. 6, p. 84) considers that the Crosthwaite bell, dated 1695,\r\n  was cast by Christopher Hodson in Kendal. In the preceding\r\n  century one of this name (spelt Hodgson) appears among the\r\n  freemen of the city, while a John and a Robert stand in the later\r\n  list of freemen armourers and hardwaremen, though the mark for\r\n  \"foreigner\" stands after their names.\r\n\r\nAt Grasmere, procrastination prevailed. The wardens, in 1723,\r\nadmitted \"The Bells are not firme & in good order, but they are\r\nagreed to make them good as soon as possible.\" In 1727 they again\r\nadmitted the bells to be out of order, but the ropes (it was\r\ndeclared) were \"good & firm.\" In 1729 the bells still waited to\r\nbe repaired \"upon a convenient opportunity.\" In 1731 the great\r\nplunge into expense was at last taken. \"One of our bells is in\r\ngood order, The Other two are recasting at York & the ropes are\r\nmaking, & everything hastning forwards to have them in good order.\"\r\nAccordingly, the accounts for 1732 show the enormous outlay incurred\r\nof £40 3s. 9-1/2d., and next year of £49 3s. \"Towards Casting the\r\nBells and other Charges;\" besides £3 14s. 5d. for \"Charges for a\r\nRinging loft.\"\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to note that the Grasmere folk, in their bell\r\ntroubles, returned to their old ecclesiastical centre at York, whence\r\ntheir first bells would come, and where there were good founders.\r\nThe inscriptions on the two largest bells, in an ornamental border\r\nrunning round the crown, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  GLORIA IN ALTISSIMIS DEO 1731\r\n\r\n              ED HIRD JOH WILSON GEO\r\n              HE HIRD WIL RIGG MACKERETH\r\n\r\n  CHURCH     E Seller\r\n  WARDENS     Ebor\r\n\r\n                           in. dia.\r\n  SOLI DEO GLORIA 1731     E Seller\r\n                           Ebor\r\n\r\nEach bell carries besides on the waist below the founder's name,\r\nthe arms and crest of the Flemings of Rydal. Arms: _Gules, a fret,\r\nargent_. Crest: _A serpent nowed, holding a garland of olives and\r\nvines in his mouth, all proper_. Motto: PAX, COPIA, SAPIENTIA, on a\r\nshield 5-1/4 by 3-3/4 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arms of the Lo. Fleming Family on the Great &\r\nMiddle Bells.]\r\n\r\nInformation about our bell-founder may be found in Mr.\r\n\r\nJ. E. Poppleton's _Bells in the West Riding of Yorkshire_.[148] At\r\nthe Restoration, and for nearly a century afterwards, a firm of\r\nSellers worked at a foundry in Jubbergate, York. William, the first\r\nknown of the family, founded a bell which yet hangs in Eskdale\r\nChurch, Cumberland. Edward, who followed, died in 1724, and was\r\nsucceeded by his son, the founder of the Grasmere bells. The second\r\nEdward used the same signatory mark as his father, and it was the\r\ncustom of both to give, after the Latin inscription--and provided\r\nthere was no donor--the names of the rector and churchwardens who\r\nwere in office at the time of the founding. The Fleming coat-of-arms\r\nundoubtedly stands for Dr. George Fleming, then rector.\r\n\r\n  [148] _Yorkshire Arch. Journal_, vols. 16, 17, and 18.\r\n\r\nA catastrophe is disclosed by the presentment of 1798, when the\r\n\"least bell\" was \"burst and unringable.\" It remained in this\r\ncondition for eleven years, when a private individual came to the\r\nrescue. Its inscription runs:--\r\n\r\n     COPIA PAX SAPIENTIA Re-cast at the expence of Mrs. Dorothy Knott\r\n     1809 T MEARS & Son of London\r\n\r\nDorothy Knott was probably daughter of John Knott, of the Howe in\r\nApplethwaite, born 1728, and of the family who removed from Grasmere\r\nto Rydal.[149] From her benefaction to the school, we learn that\r\nshe lived in Ambleside, where spinster ladies of means were wont to\r\nsettle.\r\n\r\n  [149] For the Knott family, see \"A Westmorland Township,\"\r\n  _Westmorland Gazette_, May 7th, 1810.\r\n\r\nThe firm of Mears, who cast the bell, worked at the noted old foundry\r\nin Whitechapel.[150] If this bell went to London, its journey was\r\na long one. But the turnpike roads were now made, which must have\r\nfacilitated carriage, and the bell would arrive by what is now the\r\nWishing Gate road. An old man living in Grasmere in 1886 used to\r\ntell of his grandmother, who remembered the church bells having been\r\nbrought by sledge over the top of White Moss, then the only road into\r\nthe valley.[151] These must have been Seller's bells, for it is just\r\npossible for three generations to bridge the 155 years; and this\r\ntraditional touch helps us to realize the remoteness of the valley in\r\nthose days, which no wheeled traffic could reach.\r\n\r\n  [150] Raven's _Bells of England_, pp. 212-16.\r\n\r\n  [151] W. Wilson's \"Former Social Life in Cumberland and\r\n  Westmorland,\" _Transactions_, Cumberland and Westmorland\r\n  Antiquarian Society, 1886.\r\n\r\nWhen odd work was done in the belfry in 1775, a letter from the\r\nbell-founder cost 5d. for porterage.\r\n\r\nCasual repairs continued to be done in the place.\r\n\r\nJohn Watson, the smith of Winterseeds, tinkered the bells in 1807;\r\nand three years after, when the little bell had arrived from London,\r\nthe two others were also down, for he was paid £3 14s. 8d. for\r\nrepairing them, and John Hartley received the considerable sum of\r\n£11 14s. 6d. for hanging them. In 1764 bell-wheels and clappers were\r\nrepaired. The head-stocking of the great bell and two bell-clappers,\r\nin 1767, cost £3 7s. 9d. Again, in 1773, 1774, and 1775, head-stocks,\r\nclappers, and repairs to ringing-loft cost about £1. The ropes in\r\n1769 cost 7s. 4-1/2d.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Great Bell Hammer]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Sabbath bell-ringing was for long one of those\r\nboon services which the Grasmere parishioner gave willingly to his\r\nchurch. Ringing on Gunpowder Plot day, and some occasions of national\r\nrejoicing and sorrow were paid for; but until 1692 nothing is put\r\ndown in the accounts for ringing, only a small item for grease\r\nfor the bells. In that year, however, the Eighteen entered into a\r\ncontract with the clerk, who was to procure men to ring on Sundays\r\nand Holy Days, and to furnish the necessary grease, at the rate of\r\n10s. a year. Next year, on its renewal with Thomas Knott, the sum\r\nwas dropped to 8s. 6d. \"and what more as the Eighteen shall think\r\nfit.\" However, the new clerk, Robert Harrison, in 1695 secured 10s.,\r\nand at this figure it remained for some fifty years. After a gap of\r\neight years in the accounts, the item reappears in 1751 at £1, and\r\nfrom that time onwards it fluctuates between the sums of 10s., 13s.\r\n4d., £1, even once in 1759 touching £1 10s., as the Eighteen were\r\nparsimoniously or liberally inclined. Finally, after a halt at 15s.,\r\nit rose in 1794 to £1 1s., and from that slowly mounted until by 1814\r\nit had reached £2 15s. 6d., at which it remained for eleven years.\r\nFrom 1826 it rose again, and between 1831 and 1858 it stood at £3 6s.\r\n£1 was then added.\r\n\r\nThe tower was an irregular source of expense, as the following items\r\nshow:--\r\n\r\n  1665  the makeing of ye steple door 3s 6d\r\n\r\n  1694  For mending the Garret: Flags 6d\r\n\r\n  1697  Lime for church and steeple £1 17s 1d; this item includes\r\n        \"charge for Bargaining.\" \"For sand\" 3s 0d. \"For\r\n        Rough-Casting the steeple\" £4 0s 0d\r\n\r\n  1717  For repairing the Steeple loft and two Doors\r\n        02: 14: 00\r\n\r\n  1718  Edwin Green, one of the Eighteen, is paid 4s 0d \"for\r\n        attending when the steeple was repaired.\"\r\n\r\n  1734  For a lock to ye Steeple door 8d\r\n\r\nWork was done on the steeple and steeple window in 1757; and in 1767\r\na load of \"slape\" cost 1s. and lime 2s. 6d. The work of white-washing\r\nrecurred frequently. Church and steeple were entirely rough-cast\r\nin 1773, at the considerable cost of £13,[152] the east window\r\n(presumably of the north aisle) being at the same time repaired. The\r\ninterior was done in 1780 for £1 5s. 6d., and the exterior both of\r\nchurch and steeple in 1791--which with the pointing of the windows\r\ncame to £3 15s. The townships repaired their individual windows next\r\nyear, this being repeated more radically in 1801.\r\n\r\n  [152] The tower and all the body of the church was rough-cast in\r\n  1910 at a cost of £200 5s. 1d.--ED.\r\n\r\nThe years 1803 and 1804 show that drastic work was done. One item\r\nstands \"To expenses of Letting white-washing the Church 8s. 0d.\"--a\r\nsum spent mainly of course in copious draughts of ale. Another is\r\n\"To writing Contracts of Letting 1s. 6d.\" The amount actually paid\r\nfor \"mending Roof of Church, and Whitewashing Church in and Out, and\r\nPinning up all Broken places in the Ruff Cast & Plaster,\" was £8\r\n12s.--certainly a modest one. Church and tower were whitewashed in\r\n1815 for £5 18s., and Edward Wilson, carpenter, received 18s. for a\r\n\"Craddle to White Wash Steeple.\" The process was repeated in 1832 at\r\na cost of £2 17s. 7-1/2d., and again in 1842, when Levi Hodgson was\r\npaid £4 15s. 9d. for the work.\r\n\r\nThe scraping, smoothing, and daubing to which the church was\r\nconstantly subjected, may account for the mutilated state of such\r\nbits of freestone (shallow mouldings, &c.) as are yet visible. In\r\nwhat year Addison's decorations were effaced by a coat of whitewash\r\nis not known. It is supposed that the black boards, painted with\r\ntexts, which yet hang in the church, replaced them, as being more\r\nconvenient for the whitewashers. If so, the once admired art of the\r\npainter was allowed little more than fifty years in which to delight\r\nand instruct the people; for one board gives, with the names of the\r\nchurchwardens, the date 1741. It is singular that in that year the\r\naccounts show no unwonted expense.\r\n\r\nAn item that occurred from time to time for \"mending sentences\" was\r\nchanged in 1763 to an annual charge of 1s. for \"cleaning church\r\nwindows and sentences.\"\r\n\r\nMany little odd expenses there were: such as the \"hack\" or pick,\r\nwhich, from its constant work on the graves, often wanted \"laying,\"\r\nor a new shaft, at 3d. A fresh one and a \"Cald-rake\" were bought in\r\n1715 for 1s. 6d.; while in 1802 \"laying Mattock\" cost 1s. 9d., and\r\n\"New Coolrake\" 1s. 6d. In 1824 a new spade cost 3s. 9d. Occasionally\r\nthe church chest wanted \"gimmers\" or hinges, or new locks, a pair of\r\nwhich cost, in 1752, 1s. 4d. An \"iron chest\" was bought in 1816 for\r\n£7 17s. 6d. The ladder was mended often, and a new one in 1734 cost\r\n9s. The \"Corps Cloth,\" procured before 1798, when it was mended at\r\n4d., required \"Dying and Pressing\" in 1803 at 3s. 3d.; and it was\r\nrenewed in 1823 for £2 15s. A new bier cost, in 1812, 11s. 6d. In\r\n1821 a small hearse was built by Edward Wilson, which could travel\r\non the improved, but still narrow roads of the parish. Its use was\r\npaid for; but in some years it was not had out at all, so--as its\r\ninitial cost was £14 9s., and the clerk was paid presently 5s. a year\r\nfor attending it, and a \"Hearse House\" was soon found necessary (£11\r\n15s.)--it was not a paying affair.\r\n\r\nEdward repaired the \"Corpes Stool\" for 2s. in 1847.\r\n\r\n\"A booke of Canons\" was bought in 1665 at 3s. 3d.; a register book in\r\n1685 at 11s., and again in 1784 at 8s.; a book of articles in 1691 at\r\n1s.; and in 1692 \"a Paper Booke for Registring ye poor\" at 2s. 9d.,\r\nas well as an Act of Parliament \"for Setling ye Poor\" at 3d.\r\n\r\nBut besides regular and casual expenses ever increasing, there were\r\nspecial acquisitions too costly to be dealt with in the ordinary\r\nyearly accounts. Such was the church plate, and the bells (as we have\r\nseen), and, presumably, the clock, which at an unknown date replaced\r\nthe dial. The present clock was, according to the terrier, presented\r\nin 1817, and was supplied by a Mr. Bellman, of Broughton-in-Furness.\r\nThe bill of 7s. 6d., paid to \"Late Mr. Bellman for dressing church\r\nclock,\" was not entered until 1820, though the previous year the\r\nregular charge started \"To John Watson for attending clock & keeping\r\nwater from it,\" which was £1 3s. 6d. for that year and afterwards 2s.\r\n6d. less. The old clock existed till recently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Work on Inner Door._]\r\n\r\nThe church porch, like the tower, was repaired at the general charge.\r\nThis, in 1761, cost only 4s. 6d. The outer doors of the porch were\r\nrenewed in 1821. Edward Wilson contracted for the wood-work for £5,\r\nwhile John Watson executed the iron-work for £3 5s. 8d. The priest's\r\ndoor was renewed also, being doubtless paid for by the rector. These\r\ndoors remain, and the initials of the Winterseeds smith, which he\r\nstamped upon his work, may be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hinges of the Outer Door of the Porch._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Door Handle in the Porch.]\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the nineteenth century the condition of the church\r\nfloor and of the antique forms had become a matter for serious\r\nconsideration. Nothing effectual, however, could be done in the way\r\nof levelling and paving until the custom of burying within the church\r\nhad ceased. Even then there was reluctance and difficulty, for the\r\nsoil was full of bones, and so close to the surface did these lie,\r\nthat, according to tradition, many were gathered and laid elsewhere,\r\nwhen the alteration finally was made. This was radically\r\nundertaken in 1840. The floor, which until then was below the level\r\nof the ground outside, was filled in and paved. The old benches\r\nwere removed, and pews set up in their place. Foreign timber--deal\r\npainted--was for the first time used instead of native oak, and the\r\nwood-work was given to an Ambleside man. The cost of the renovation,\r\nwhich included repairs to roof and renewal of windows, amounted to\r\n£300, and this was raised by subscription--Queen Adelaide (who was\r\nvisiting the district) contributing £50.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of the forms could not do other than tend to the\r\nbreaking up of old customs. The pews were no doubt apportioned to the\r\nvarious households, in Grasmere township at least; while the question\r\nof the rightful share possessed by the sister townships in this\r\naltered accommodation was left open, as the events of 1856 show (see\r\nChurch Rates). With household pews, men and women sat together. The\r\nwestern door, hitherto used by the men, and outside which (according\r\nto tradition) all secular notices had been given out, was now made\r\nup. £1 1s. had been paid, as late as 1816, \"To John Watson for\r\nHanging of Men's Door.\" At the same time the tower-arch was walled\r\nup, and the tower used for a vestry--the old wooden one being cleared\r\naway. The font was brought into the church. The expenses of the old\r\nvestry fire, which had risen to 5s., cease accordingly, and those of\r\nlighting the \"stove\"--placed presumably in the church itself--begin\r\nat 12s. a year. Comfort was now thought of. Straw matting had indeed\r\nbeen procured for the communion rail in 1780 (3s. 1d.); it was bought\r\nin 1844 for 11s. 4d.\r\n\r\nThe era of subscriptions raised the rate of church expenses\r\nenormously, as has been seen in the 1840 renovation. In 1876 the\r\nrough-casting of the church outside was done by subscription, and\r\ncontracted for at £30; £70 13s. 0-1/2d. being altogether expended\r\nupon that and new spouts and painting clock, a sum which should be\r\ncompared with the cost on previous occasions.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. E. Jefferies, who was the first rector--certainly after\r\nthe days of Dr. Fleming--to take a zealous interest in the fabric,\r\nreconstructed in 1841 the entire east wall at his own expense.[153]\r\nHe also presented the two carved chairs that stand within the\r\nsanctuary. He made with his own hands a communion-table[154] and\r\nfoot-stools; the latter remain.\r\n\r\n  [153] See Middleton's Guide.\r\n\r\n  [154] This table is now in use at a Mission room in Ulverston\r\n  parish.\r\n\r\nAnother great renovation was carried out in 1879-80 under Mr.\r\nFletcher. Like the last, its cost was defrayed by offerings (£660),\r\nand much of the work done in 1840 was now undone. The deal pews were\r\ncleared away and the existing oak benches substituted--Grasmere\r\nworkmen being employed. The tower arch was again opened out, and the\r\nfont replaced. A vestry was partitioned off the north-east angle\r\nof the church, which was formerly known as the Langdale choir. New\r\npulpit, font-cover, communion-table, and Litany-desk were provided\r\nin 1884, and five years later the lectern was given by Miss Agar, of\r\nSilverhow, in memory of her aunt. The alms-dishes that hang on the\r\nsouth wall were found a few years ago in the old tithe-barn, which\r\nhas been turned into a parish-room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Collecting Plate with Handle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCHYARD.\r\n\r\nFrom the Restoration there is evidence that the garth outside the\r\nchurch was cared for. It was surrounded, as we have seen, with stout\r\nrough-cast walls, which were divided among the townships for upkeep.\r\nThe space within them was not strictly divided, yet the older graves\r\nshow that there was an inclination for each township to lay its dead\r\nadjacent to its own gateway and stretch of wall. The keeping in order\r\nof the grassy space, with its ever-increasing mounds, fell to the\r\ngeneral charge. An item stands in 1673, \"For dresing weeds out of ye\r\nChurch yard,\" 1s. 6d.; and a charge becomes frequent for \"repairing\r\nchurch-yard walks, 4s. 6d.,\" or \"cleaning church-yard,\" 2s. 6d. Three\r\ndays at this in 1631 cost 6s. 9d.\r\n\r\nGrasmere township paid in 1661 \"For our P't of the Dyell\" 1s. This\r\nmust have proved an unsatisfactory time-teller, as in 1683 4s. was\r\npaid \"For a diall & post.\" A post alone cost, in 1732, 1s. 9d., and\r\nagain in 1743 a new dial-post was fixed at 3s. 9d.\r\n\r\nTrees were planted from time to time. Young ashes were set in 1684\r\nat a cost of 1s. 6d. The yew tree, though no longer needed for the\r\nbow, was still grown. A fresh one, planted in 1706, at a cost of\r\n1s., perhaps took the place of the old one blown down in the gale of\r\nDecember 18th, 1687.[155] This, too, which would now have numbered\r\nover 200 years, appears to have gone. The existing trees were planted\r\nin 1819 through the instrumentality of the poet Wordsworth (from a\r\nsum supplied by his friend, Sir George Beaumont), and he continued to\r\ncare for them.\r\n\r\n  [155] December 18th, 1687: \"There hath been three very great\r\n  Windes lately viz. Nov. 10, 87. at night, Dec. 3, 87. at night,\r\n  and yester-night and all this day which was ye worst, & which\r\n  hath blowne down ye great Ewe-tree in Gresmere Church Yard, the\r\n  very tall Firr Tree at Ambleside, & many trees in Rydal Demesne,\r\n  etc. It was accompanied with much snow.\"--Sir D. F.'s Account\r\n  Book.\r\n\r\nThe poet himself lies beneath their shade. Of the countless graves\r\nthat stud this ancient burying-place, it is his that draws the\r\npilgrims from afar; and the yard, encircled by its yews and the great\r\nmountains, has perhaps inspired more and better poetry than any other\r\nplot in England. Hartley Coleridge, Sir John Richardson, Green and\r\nHull the artists, are buried here, and their graves may be found by\r\nreferring to the short Guide issued by Mr. Peterson.\r\n\r\nWordsworth's monument, a medallion by Woolner, is within the\r\nchurch. The beautiful inscription is a translation of Keble's Latin\r\ndedication of his Oxford Lectures on Poetry to Wordsworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM CHURCHWARDENS' ACCOUNTS AND PRESENTMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nGRESMYRE.\r\n\r\n     The First day of Apprill in the XIIIJth of the Kings Ma'tyes\r\n     Reigne A treue & A P'fect Acount of ye Disbursment of James\r\n     Benson & Robert Watson Church Wardens For the yeare last past.\r\n\r\n                                                 li  s  d\r\n\r\n  Anno Domini 1661 as Followeth\r\n\r\n  Imprimus for mending & mossing the Church      00 07 04\r\n  Ittem for mending the Font stone               00 02 08\r\n  Ittem for the Font Couer[156]                  00 02 08\r\n  Ittem soldering the lead in the Font stone     00 00 06\r\n  Ittem For a Quission for the pulpitt           00 02 02\r\n  Ittem For A table cloth                        00 01 04\r\n  Ittem For A Raill at the pullpit side          00 00 10\r\n  Ittem For our p't of the Dyell                 00 01 00\r\n  Ittem For mending the great bell Leather       00 00 02\r\n  Ittem For our p'te of A surp cloth we bought   00 01 08\r\n  Ittem For Drissing the Church                  00 00 04\r\n  Ittem For greace to ye bells For our p'te      00 00 04\r\n  Ittem For Lime for ye windowes & Fireing for\r\n         glasser                                 00 00 04\r\n  Ittem payed to ye glasser for mending our p'te of\r\n         windowes                                00 06 00\r\n  Ittem For A new botle to the Church            00 03 00\r\n  Ittem payed For bread and wine                 00 08 04\r\n  Ittem payed to John Jackson for lying 2 graues 00 00 04\r\n  Ittem For writting this yeare                  00 00 04\r\n  Ittem for Two Journeyes to Ambleside           00 00 08\r\n                                                 --------\r\n                                                 li  s  d\r\n\r\n                              The sume totall    02 09  0\r\n\r\n  [156] The old font cover (see engraving) is lost.\r\n\r\nTwo churchwardens sign by a mark at the bottom.

absentee\r\nrector, the Rev. John Ambrose; and under him was a curate-in-charge,\r\nthe Rev. John Brathwaite. One of his name, son of William, \"pleb.,\"\r\nmatriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, in 1631, aged 18, whom Dr.\r\nMagrath thinks may have been he.[157] Under Mr. Thomas Brathwaite's\r\nwill, 1674, \"Mr. Brawthwaite minister of Grassemire\" received a\r\nlegacy of 20s., which shows that he enjoyed the esteem of that\r\nPuritanical gentleman. He often appears in the Account Book. For\r\nchurching the squire's wife he received regularly 5s.; until there\r\ncomes the melancholy item in 1675:--\r\n\r\n  [157] See \"Flemings in Oxford.\"\r\n\r\n                                                      £  s. d.\r\n\r\n  Apr. 17--Given to Mr. Jo. Brathwait for preaching\r\n  of my Dear Wifes Funerall Sermon (upon Prov.\r\n  31, 29) and often visiting her dureing ye time\r\n  of her sickness and praying by her                  02 00 00\r\n\r\nOther items are more cheerful; for often the minister's little\r\ndaughter would carry offerings of fruit, cherries and wild\r\nblackberries to the Hall, for which she would receive a _douceur_ in\r\nreturn. Also, as boys apparently then caught woodcocks in springes,\r\nas they did later (see Wordsworth's Prelude), the item occurs in\r\n1782:--\r\n\r\n                                                      £  s.  d.\r\n\r\n  Dec. 12--Given Parson Brathwait's Son who brought\r\n      some Wood-cockes                               00  00  06\r\n\r\nThe daughter seemingly married in 1685, for the Squire's boys were\r\ndispatched on May 24th, with money to give at her offering--a\r\ncollection made at the wedding for the benefit of the couple; Will\r\ngiving 5s. and Dan 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1684 that Parson Ambrose, who for some forty years had\r\nbeen connected with the rectory of Grasmere, passed to his long\r\nrest. By surviving five brothers--several of whom were bachelors\r\nlike himself--he succeeded to the family estate; and the old Furness\r\nhomestead had been added to his other residences.[158] The Rydal\r\nsquire notes in that Account Book--which became practically a diary:--\r\n\r\n  [158] West's _Antiquities of Furness_.\r\n\r\n                                                       £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n  Aug. 20--My Cosin Ambrose, Lord of Lowick and\r\n      Parson of Gresmere, dying Aug. 16. 84 was\r\n      this day buried, and I attended his Corps from\r\n      Lowick-hall unto Ulverston-Church, where he\r\n      lyes interred, being ye last male of his family\r\n      in ye North                                      00  00  00\r\n\r\nLittle as Grasmere had known him, the old man remembered the place\r\nin his will, and bequeathed £50 for the school, under trust to the\r\n\"minister and such persons as shall be of the four and twenty of the\r\nparish of Grasmere.\"\r\n\r\nThe death of Ambrose left the post vacant for Henry Fleming, the\r\nsquire's second son, who had been bred up to the church, doubtless in\r\nreadiness for it. He had taken his B.A. degree in 1682, from Queen's\r\nCollege, Oxford, and there he was still residing, in preparation\r\nfor his M.A. degree, to be taken next year. Presented now by his\r\nfather to Grasmere, he proceeded on November 22nd to Carlisle for\r\nhis ordination, and next month rode to Chester to complete the\r\nbusiness of his appointment. On January 7th he was formally inducted\r\nto the ancient fabric, over which he was now--a young man of 25--to\r\nrule; and his father on this occasion opened heart and purse to his\r\nneighbours at the Church-Stile Inn in an unwonted manner.\r\n\r\n     \" ... and spent Jan. 7 at Robert Harrisons in Gresmere when he\r\n     was Inducted by Mr. Jo. Brathwait 3s. 6d.\"\r\n\r\nThe new rector then returned to Oxford, where he remained until the\r\nend of 1687. Clearly he was in no haste to settle down in Grasmere,\r\nat any rate before his income was free from burden[159] and until\r\nsomething was done to the rectory, which wanted effectual repair. His\r\neldest brother assisted him in plans; and he wrote to his father on\r\nMarch 14th, 1687, \"I have received a letter from my Brother William\r\nconcerning Grasmere church and Parsonage House, with a model of the\r\nhouse he designes to build, which I like very well, if the money\r\nwill finish it, and adorn the church. But I am affraid that it will\r\nfall short unless you be pleased to be assisting in wood.\"\r\n\r\n  [159] The outlay connected with Henry's appointment was\r\n  considerable. His expenses in Carlisle with his brother Daniel\r\n  amounted to £2. 7s. 6d.; also after ordination \"For ye Bread and\r\n  Wine at ye Communion in Carlile-Cathedral\" 2s. 6d., and 1s. given\r\n  at the offertory. At Chester, besides expenses and fees, he paid\r\n  the Bishop of Chester's secretary £5. 5s. Next, on February 13th,\r\n  comes the item \"Delivered my Son Henry to pay tomorrow at Kendal\r\n  for his Tenths for Gresmer due at Xtmas last, ye sum of\" £2. 17s.\r\n  0-1/2d. Again on May 30th, \"Paid at London unto Mr. James Bird\r\n  for ye first payment of my Son Henry Fleming's First-Fruites for\r\n  ye Parsonage of Gresmere, ye Sum of\" £6. 8s. 7d. On November\r\n  18th, the same amount was paid as second instalment; the third\r\n  on October 9th, 1687, £6. 11s. 1d.; and a final of £7. 1s. on\r\n  July 31st, 1688. The total, £26. 19s. 3d., is a little over the\r\n  amount paid by the Rector of Clayworth as first-fruits in 1672.\r\n  Money was, however, now coming in, and Parson Brathwaite would\r\n  seem to have furnished the new rector with a round sum of £20 at\r\n  intervals, beginning in May, 1685; two such being paid in 1687.\r\n  What the arrangement was in regard to the curate's stipend is not\r\n  clear.\r\n\r\nProbably the squire did assist; and it may be a stout oak from\r\nBainriggs that bears still the incised legend \"This House was built\r\n1687 Henry Fleming Par\"; which implies that the house was entirely\r\nremodelled.[160] The work went briskly forward, and on June 22nd the\r\nsquire noted:--\r\n\r\n  [160] The beam was dislodged when the new rectory was built in\r\n  1895, but upon the furnishing of the old tithe barn as a parish\r\n  room in 1905, it was appropriately set up there.\r\n\r\n                                                     £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n  \"Spent yesterday at Gresmere when I viewed ye\r\n      Painting in ye Church, and ye Parsonage new\r\n      House                                         00   05  00\r\n\r\nwhich meant tips and treats at the alehouse, and a great commotion.\r\n\r\nHarry was still in Oxford in October, but early in December he was\r\ndown, and preached to his people.\r\n\r\n     Dec. 11--This day my Son Henry Fleming preached his first\r\n     sermon--upon Romans xiii in Gresmere church, where I would have\r\n     been, had I had notice of his preaching.\r\n\r\nThis statement shows Harry's nervousness in face of his clever\r\nfather. It may have been with reluctance that he left the University\r\nwhere for nine and a half years he had lived a student's life; but\r\nthat his departure was intended to be final is clear, from the fact\r\nthat his box followed him, the cost of its carriage being 11s.--44\r\nlb. at 3d. per lb.\r\n\r\nHarry would seem to have been a quiet, unostentatious man. His tutor,\r\nthe Rev. Thomas Dixon, wrote of him to his father on his first\r\narrival from the country, \"Yo^r Son is both frugall and studious, and\r\nall that I find amiss in him is that he wants courage and heart, I\r\ndo all I can to animate and encourage him and to put some more spirit\r\ninto him. I hope disputeing in ye Hall will put some briskness and\r\nmetall into him, and teach him to wrangle: He is one of three that\r\nyo^r nephew Fletcher calls his Juniors in ye Hall, So that they\r\nmust endeavour to bafle him and then heel cease to stand upon his\r\nSeniority or att least to triumph in it. He deserves also all the\r\nencouragem^t, that may be, because he is willing to do anything and\r\nfrequents Prayers and Disputacons as much as any one, though of much\r\nless Quality and honour than himselfe. He has another fellow-Pupill\r\nof ye same order that keepes pace with him, and they have combin'd to\r\nsett patterns to all ye rest of their Table: I hope theyl continue\r\nthis their emulacon, and that yo^r Son will also excite others of his\r\ndegree to ye same excellency and p'fection.\"[161]\r\n\r\n  [161] Ry. Hall MSS., His. MS. Com. 2084.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Harry was never taught to \"wrangle\"; and though\r\nhis abilities were excellent, he rose to no high office in the\r\nChurch, like his brother George. He had a true interest in his\r\nparish, as we must suppose, from the encouragement he gave to the\r\npeople over the embellishment of the church; and the accounts show\r\nthat \"ye Dr.\" went over into Langdale at least once (in 1696) to\r\npreach and administer the sacraments. He neglected the bells, as\r\nhas been seen, and possibly the wardens had a difficulty in getting\r\nhold of him; for from 1694, when he acquired the living of Asby,\r\nCumberland, he resided there. He married, in 1700, Mary, daughter of\r\nJohn Fletcher, of Hunslet, and on his death, in 1728, left a daughter\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nWith Dr. Henry Fleming was associated, as curate, the Rev. Thomas\r\nKnott. This worthy man was doubtless of the Grasmere stock that for\r\nso many generations had supplied able and prominent members to the\r\nvillage community.[162] He entered his name in the Grasmere register\r\nas curate and schoolmaster in 1687. In 1694 he was promoted to the\r\nmore independent (and doubtless better paid) curacy of Ambleside. The\r\nletter he wrote to his rector on the occasion of the Kelsick bequest,\r\nwhich does credit to them both, has already appeared in print.[163]\r\nThe Rev. Thomas continued to officiate in Ambleside until his death\r\nin 1744.\r\n\r\n  [162] See _A Westmorland Township, Westmorland Gazette_, May 7th,\r\n  1910. He was not, however, as there stated, the son of Michael.\r\n\r\n  [163] See _Ambleside Town and Chapel_, p. 53.\r\n\r\nThe Squire of Rydal (who had been knighted in 1681) died in 1701, and\r\nit was the curate-in-charge, Dudley Walker, who preached his funeral\r\nsermon and received the honorarium of £1 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\nThe removal of this strong spirit must have made a difference in the\r\nparish. His heir, William, who purchased a baronetcy, was a man of\r\nfeebler type, whose influence would be little felt in the parish.\r\nHe ceased, apparently, to worship at the old church, for in 1728 he\r\nbought the two front pews in Ambleside Chapel, which had belonged\r\nto the Braithwaites. On the death of his brother Henry, he appears\r\nto have nominated for the rectory of Grasmere one William Kilner,\r\nwho immediately retired in favour of another son of Sir Daniel,\r\nGeorge, born 1667. He was totally unlike his brother Henry in\r\ntemperament. Handsome in person, of good abilities, assured spirit\r\nand pleasant manners, his path in life proved an easy one. As a boy,\r\nhe, of all the brothers, had found it possible to ask his father\r\nfor money, whether to bet upon his cock at the Shrove-tide fight,\r\nor to enter his college library, or even to engage in a trading\r\nventure.[164] Once within the church, he advanced rapidly, for his\r\nfather's old friend, Dr. Smith, Bishop of Carlisle, gave him the\r\nliving of Aspatria in 1695, and four years later made the young man\r\nhis domestic chaplain. From that time he accumulated benefices and\r\nhonours. Made Archdeacon of Carlisle in 1705, he became Dean in\r\n1727, shortly before his brother's death gave him the opportunity\r\nof absorbing Grasmere. The wardens' presentment of 1729 states \"Our\r\nexpected Rector is not yet Instituted and Inducted, the Cure is duly\r\nSupplyed by a Curate; we know not what Salary is allowed him.\" The\r\nchurch for the moment would seem to be poorly manned, for it adds \"We\r\nhave no Parish Clark or Sexton at present.\"\r\n\r\n  [164] See _Ambleside Town and Chapel_. More particulars of the\r\n  education of George Fleming will be found in the forthcoming\r\n  Chronicles of Rydal.\r\n\r\nThe august rector, who had other benefices, was probably little seen\r\nin his native parish; and in 1733 he resigned it in favour of his\r\nonly son, William, who also became Archdeacon after him. Next year\r\nGeorge stepped up to the post of Bishop of Carlisle; and in 1736, on\r\nhis brother William's death, he succeeded to the Rydal estates and\r\nthe baronetcy. His only misfortune was the death of his son in 1743.\r\nHe himself died in 1747, and a nephew became possessed of Rydal Hall\r\nand of the patronage of the church.[165]\r\n\r\n  [165] See _Dictionary of National Biography_. The fact of his\r\n  having acquired the rectorate of Grasmere seems, however, not to\r\n  have been known to his biographers; but the Registry of Chester\r\n  shows it.\r\n\r\nIt is risky to judge from negative evidence: but there is nothing to\r\nshow that George Fleming, bishop and baronet, did anything either as\r\nrector or patron to benefit the church where he had worshipped as a\r\nchild, or the parish whence he and his son drew an income for fifteen\r\nyears; the sole mention of him in the church books being a statement\r\nthat he held a confirmation there in place of the Bishop of Chester.\r\nThe wardens and the Eighteen, with the curate, kept parochial matters\r\ngoing; and the former, wearied no doubt of waiting for help from the\r\nrector, tackled the great bell outlay in 1730-2, as has been seen.\r\n\r\nAfter he had become bishop, George Fleming erected in the choir the\r\nmarble monument that commemorates (in grandiose Latin) his father and\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. George Briggs acted as curate-in-charge from 1722. Though\r\nhe may not have enjoyed a university training, the facts of his life\r\nthat have been found suggest that his ministrations were beneficial\r\nto the folk. Like the first \"capellanus,\" of whom there is record,\r\nAdam de Ottelay, and many another simple curate, he had footing in\r\nthe community as statesman, holding house and land. In 1725 he first\r\nappears as \"Mr. Briggs\" in the Rydal rental, paying a lord's rent of\r\n8s. 4d. for Padmar, or Padmire (Pavement End), which had belonged to\r\nthe Rydal manor apparently since the days of Squire John. In that\r\nyear also the minister, described as \"clerk,\" married Miss Jane\r\nKnott, of Rydal, daughter probably of Edward and sister of Michael,\r\nwho, for so long, acted as influential agents to the Rydal lord.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jane Briggs remained long as widow in possession of the Padmire\r\nestate; and the name of the Rev. George Briggs--doubtless her\r\nson--appears as holder, after a gap, in 1806; in 1819 that of the\r\nRev. William Pearson has taken its place.[166]\r\n\r\n  [166] One would willingly connect this Grasmere land-holder\r\n  with the astronomer of the same name who enjoys a place in the\r\n  _National Dictionary of Biography_. This remarkable man was born\r\n  of statesmen parents as near as Whitbeck, under Black Combe,\r\n  in 1767, and was educated at the Hawkshead Grammar School. His\r\n  biographer, Dr. Lonsdale, in the _Worthies of Cumberland_, says,\r\n  \"Between his leaving Hawkshead and his becoming a clergyman of\r\n  the Church of England I have no facts to guide me: but it may be\r\n  inferred that he went to Cambridge.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the death of the Archdeacon had left the rectorate vacant,\r\nand an unfortunate nomination was made by the patron-bishop. The Rev.\r\nJohn Craik, B.A., was probably never resident--a fact quite usual:\r\nbut to this was presently added the more painful one that he became\r\nincapable of managing his affairs, and his sister had to act for him.\r\nOnly five years after his appointment, Sir William Fleming writes of\r\nthe complaints of the parishioners, who with a church sadly in need\r\nof repair can do nothing, since the rector will not come over to see\r\nto it. Matters presently became so acute that a petition was framed,\r\nbegging the Bishop of Chester to intervene, as Mr. Craik was out of\r\nhis mind, and had not been near the church for three years.[167]\r\nYet it was not till the man's death, in 1806, that this miserable\r\nsituation came to an end.\r\n\r\n  [167] Rydal Hall MSS.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Gawen Mackereth was curate under Mr. Craik. To judge by his\r\nname, he was a native of the vales, and he apparently entered the\r\nchurch--like many more in this period--by the door of the village\r\nschool-house. He wrote his name in the register on October 23rd,\r\n1735, as \"Ludimagister et Clericus Grasmereiensis,\" copying the\r\ninscription of Thomas Knott, though with a fault in the spelling.\r\nTwenty years later he preached for the last time his two yearly\r\nsermons in Langdale. Sir William Fleming chose the next curate\r\nhimself; and he may have intended the Rev. John Wilson to occupy\r\nthe post of rector, should this fall vacant. But that day was far\r\ndistant, and Wilson--who seems from his action with regard to the\r\nowner of Bainrigg to have been a man of strong temper--lived but a\r\nshort time after his appointment.[168]\r\n\r\n  [168] _Rydal Chronicles._\r\n\r\nHe was followed by Edward Rowlandson, of whom scarcely anything is\r\nknown; but who--according to the register that records his burial in\r\n1811--served the parish for fifty years. He could not have taught the\r\nschool, as the burial of Thomas Davis, schoolmaster, is recorded in\r\n1801.\r\n\r\nUnder him and Craik Grasmere must, indeed, have slumbered\r\nspiritually. How could it be otherwise? But by this time Craik was\r\ndead, after being rector for sixty-three years--surely a record term\r\nfor a lunatic! In the same year, 1806, Sir Michael le Fleming, the\r\npatron who had never exercised his rights, died likewise. His widow,\r\nLady Diana, nominated as rector the Rev. Thomas Jackson. With him the\r\nlong record of absentee rectors was broken. He is said to have sprung\r\nfrom a family of dalesfolk. He united, like some early predecessors,\r\nhis spiritual office with a temporal one, and acted as \"clerk\" or\r\nagent to his patron. With his assistance, the heiress and Lady of\r\nRydal Hall freed her estate from debt, bought the ruinous homesteads\r\nof the village, and replaced them by pretty cottages. Jackson was\r\nsuccessful also with his own affairs, and left a good deal of\r\nproperty at his death, including Harry Place in Langdale, Tail End\r\nin Grasmere, Brow Head in Loughrigg, and Waterhead on Windermere. He\r\nlived, it is said, at Harry Place, and on most days rode his pony\r\n(according to the report of old Langdale folk) over the fell to\r\nGrasmere or Rydal Hall.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the rectory was let to the poet Wordsworth.\r\nThe premises had been sadly neglected, the wardens having, in 1798,\r\n\"presented\" the \"Rectory-House, Barn, and out-Houses\" as being in \"a\r\nruinous state,\" but the new rector was too good a business man to\r\nleave them in that condition. Dorothy Wordsworth writes (May 11th,\r\n1810) that Mr. Jackson is willing to make the Parsonage comfortable,\r\nand will contrive a good library out of part of the barn. Later\r\n(June, 1811), she says, \"There is an oblong 4-cornered court before\r\nthe door, surrounded by ugly white walls.\"[169]\r\n\r\n  [169] _Letters of the Wordsworth Family._\r\n\r\nThis graphic touch is interesting and suggestive. The place had\r\napparently an ancient character, with a strongly walled fore-court,\r\ncapable of being closed and defended. Such a plan--which was always\r\nthat of a manor-house--might be necessary of old for rectories,\r\nwhere the tithe-barn, often stored with grain and hay, stood\r\ntemptingly, and occasionally was the subject of dispute.[170] Now\r\nit is just possible that the rectory may occupy the site of the\r\nformer offices of the demesne. No manorial lord was ever resident\r\nin this remote vale, as far as we know; but a resident bailiff and\r\na forester there must at least have been, with a few underlings.\r\nThese officers would be placed in a lodge, stoutly barricaded with\r\nwooden palisades--later converted into walls. To this nucleus would\r\nbe added, besides byres and barns and smithy, a \"knight's chamber,\"\r\nfor the accommodation of the lord, if he visited the spot, or pushed\r\nso far in the chase; and nothing is more likely than that a priest's\r\nchamber or house (along with the tithe-barn) would find a place\r\nwithin this safe enclosure. In such a case, the decay and final\r\nabolition of the demesne would leave the rectory in sole occupation\r\nof the ground. Wordsworth gave up his tenancy, after the death of two\r\nchildren, in the belief that the spot was unhealthy. It must have\r\nbeen still more so in ancient times, while the marsh that almost\r\nsurrounds it was still undrained.\r\n\r\n  [170] In the mediæval story of Reynard the Fox, the Priest's barn\r\n  is well walled about. See Francis Bond's _Misericords_, p. 73.\r\n\r\nOn the re-construction of the rectory in 1895 the old elevation was\r\npreserved as much as possible, but the level of the ground floor was\r\nraised five feet.\r\n\r\nTradition also states that the Rev. Thomas Jackson served personally\r\nthe chapel of Langdale, and certainly--if he lived in that\r\nvalley--this would be more convenient for him than the parish church.\r\nThe curates under him appear to have been men of ability and worth.\r\nWilliam Johnson indeed secured a fame as educationalist that is\r\nrecorded in the _National Dictionary_. A Cumberland man, born in\r\n1784, he appears to have come to Grasmere as schoolmaster before the\r\ndeath of the old curate Rowlandson. He began to officiate in 1810,\r\nshortly after he had entered St. John's College, Cambridge. His stay\r\nin Grasmere was short, for Dr. Andrew Bell, when visiting Wordsworth\r\nin 1811, was so struck by his management of the village school, that\r\nhe offered him the post of Master of the school then being built by\r\nthe National Society in London; and thither he repaired next year.\r\nHe became organizer to the Society and school inspector and rector\r\nof a London church. After his retirement from more active work, he\r\nreturned (about 1848) to Grasmere, where he bought a piece of land\r\nand built the house, since enlarged, called Huntingstile. He was a\r\nfriend of Edward Quillinan, Wordsworth's son-in-law, and in 1853\r\nedited his poems with a memoir. He lived till 1864.\r\n\r\nJohnson's name occurs in the letters of the De Quincey family. The\r\nfuture Opium-eater had just settled at Dove Cottage, where he was\r\nvisited by his mother and sisters. The elder lady was a friend of\r\nMrs. Hannah More, and it is a little amusing to find that the aid of\r\nthat prophetess of the Evangelical Revival was invoked for Grasmere,\r\nwhich was evidently considered, by the strangers who began to invade\r\nthe district, to be in a benighted state. At one particular evening\r\nreception at Barley Wood, Mrs. More's home, an effort was made to\r\nengage her interest in what were called \"the Christian politicks\" of\r\nGrasmere; but little was gained beyond a vague promise of Tracts,\r\nuntil the opportune arrival of Mr. Venn from Clapham, who gave hopes\r\nof help (for a time at least) from the Sunday School Society in money\r\nand books. Mrs. De Quincey, in reporting the matter to her son, looks\r\nforward to the time when \"experience recommends the Institution\r\nto more effectual patronage at home, where at present it is an\r\nexperiment, and viewed with indifference, if not with suspicion,\r\nby people who must very feebly comprehend the value of religious\r\ninstruction.\"[171] The \"good Pastor\" was to be cheered, meanwhile,\r\n\"under his difficult labour\" by the magic of Mrs. More's name, and\r\nthe promise of more substantial aid when the De Quincey ladies should\r\narrive.\r\n\r\n  [171] _De Quincey Memorials_, vol. ii., 90-91.\r\n\r\nBut aid was to be found at hand, which probably did not excite\r\nsuspicion. To Lady Fleming religion became increasingly dear after\r\nhome troubles left her a lonely woman. Her accounts show that in 1817\r\n14s. 8d. was paid to \"Mr. Noble Wilson, Schoolmaster\"--possibly for\r\nbooks: and in 1821 a fee of ten guineas was paid him \"for Teaching\r\nSunday School.\" Mr. Wilson, who followed Robert Powley (inscribed as\r\ncurate in 1814), must have been a favourite. He came over from his\r\ncure at Witherslack in 1831 to bury Mr. Samuel Barber, who had made\r\n\"Gell's Cottage\" (now Silverhow) his home.\r\n\r\nEvil days had fallen once more on the Grasmere rectorate. The Rev.\r\nThomas Jackson died in 1822. He left two sons, one of whom, educated\r\nfor the law, succeeded him as agent at Rydal Hall. The other,\r\nWilliam, was bred up to the church, and no doubt his father had hopes\r\nthat he would succeed him as rector.[172] But the right of nomination\r\nhad, unfortunately, passed into the hands of Sir Daniel Fleming. No\r\nprotest to the bishop, as regards his choice, was of avail, and the\r\nnominee, Sir Richard le Fleming, took office.\r\n\r\n  [172] The Ven. William Jackson, D.D., was born in 1792, and\r\n  preferred to the benefices of Whitehaven, Penrith, Cliburn and\r\n  Lowther (Rector 1828-1878) by the Earl of Lonsdale, who gave him\r\n  Askham Hall to serve as the Rectory of Lowther. Bishop Percy\r\n  appointed him Canon and Chancellor of Carlisle, and gave him an\r\n  Archdeaconry, which he resigned on becoming Provost of Queen's\r\n  College, Oxford (1862-1878). He married the daughter of Mr. Crump\r\n  who built Allan Bank, and had four daughters; two died young, one\r\n  married a Mr. John H. Crump, the other the present Provost of\r\n  Queen's College, Oxford, the Rev. J. R. Magrath, D.D.--ED.\r\n\r\nThe rector remained at the rectory after his inhibition in 1834, and\r\ncurates, named Kingsley, Magrath, and Harris did duty successively\r\nfor two years each. Then, in 1840, came the Rev. Edward Jefferies,\r\nwho for so long ministered to the parish as curate and rector. He\r\nremained as curate when, in 1857, the opportunity came for Lady\r\nFleming to appoint her distant kinsman, the Rev. Fletcher Fleming,\r\nof Rayrigg (already serving the chapel of Rydal), to the rectorate,\r\nbut when he retired, in 1863, the Rev. Edward was fully installed in\r\nhis office. Mr. Jefferies died in 1893.[173] The men who followed him\r\nare still (1912) living; the Revs. H. M. Fletcher, W. Jennings, J. H.\r\nHeywood, and M. F. Peterson.\r\n\r\n  [173] He had resigned the living in 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPELS.\r\n\r\nBrief mention of the later history of the chapelries under Grasmere\r\nmay be made here.\r\n\r\nAmbleside, when the crisis of the Reformation came, took matters\r\nstrenuously in hand, as we have seen. The townsmen provided a regular\r\nstipend for a curate who could teach Latin and Greek to their sons,\r\nand also kept up the fabric of the chapel, in complete independence\r\nof the mother church. Moreover the right of burial and baptism at\r\nthe chapel was secured in 1676, after some opposition from the\r\npatron.[174] Nothing, perhaps, was definitely fixed with regard\r\nto the nomination of the schoolmaster-curate, when the townsfolk\r\nundertook to furnish his salary in 1584. They may have hoped that it\r\nwould be left to themselves; and certainly they, with Mr. Braithwaite\r\nat their head, appointed during the Commonwealth. But the strong\r\nSquire of Rydal soon made it plain, that as patron of the mother\r\nchurch, he meant to establish his claim to the patronage of the\r\ndaughter chapel, which stood on the Grasmere side of Stock Beck.[175]\r\nIt has remained in his family ever since.\r\n\r\n  [174] See _Ambleside Town and Chapel_, p. 42.\r\n\r\n  [175] See _Ambleside Town and Chapel_, p. 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBLESIDE CHAPEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be well to give a list of the Post-Reformation parsons of\r\nAmbleside (rectified according to present knowledge), as well as\r\nthe evidence of a provision made for them in 1584. This evidence\r\nwas found amongst Mr. George Browne's MSS. too late for insertion\r\nin _Ambleside Town and Chapel_, where the deed of 1597 is given in\r\nfull. It is an extract from a contemporaneous document, written out\r\nin a memorandum book of Christopher Birkett, who owned part of the\r\nlands of the Forrest family in Ambleside; and it records the fixed\r\ncontributions of that family to the endowment.\r\n\r\n     \"Forth of the Schedule conteining the sums of money granted by\r\n     ye Ten^{ts} and Inhabitants of Amble' for the repaires of the\r\n     Chapel and payeing the Ministers Stipend according to an Award\r\n     whereto the schedule is Annexed.

A new era was marked\r\nby the endowment of 1584, and the appointment of an excellent and\r\nlearned man followed.\r\n\r\n     1585--JOHN BELL. He was the first curate to inscribe his name in\r\n     the Bible belonging to the chapel, which, after long alienation,\r\n     has been restored to the church.[176] Bell's latest inscription\r\n     tells that he had then served (in 1629) for 44 years. He was\r\n     buried in Grasmere, December 23rd, 1634. His fine action in\r\n     constructing with his scholars a causeway across the miry bottom\r\n     between Ambleside and Rydal was long held in remembrance.

But whether we are to take\r\n  it that John Osgood served as a clergyman or suffered as a Quaker\r\n  is not easy to decide.--ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGDALE CURATES\r\n\r\n\r\nLangdale was, at the Reformation, in worse case than Ambleside, where\r\nthe townsfolk were rich enough to put both chapel and school on a\r\nsound financial basis. The Little Langdale chapel ceased to be. The\r\none in Great Langdale, bereft of its particular ministering priest,\r\nwas threatened with a like fate. Probably it was never closed,\r\nhowever. An intelligent native would be found to act as clerk for\r\na nominal wage, and occasionally the rector would visit it, and\r\nwould administer the Easter communion to those who were too old or\r\nill to cross the fell. Two clerks appear in the register before\r\nthe Commonwealth, who may have acted as lay readers. During the\r\nCommonwealth the chapel would be wholly in the hands of the sect that\r\nhappened to be dominant for the moment; and the fact that its pulpit\r\nwas open to any religious speaker undoubtedly caused the followers of\r\nGeorge Fox to be more numerous in Langdale than in any other quarter\r\nof the parish. It was a Quaker who resisted the Episcopal church\r\nservice, when it was revived. (See p. 88.)\r\n\r\nBut order was again established at the Restoration. Weekly services\r\nwere apparently conducted by a lay clerk, and the Grasmere curate in\r\ncharge came over once a year to administer sacrament (at a charge of\r\n2s. 6d. to the township), and twice or thrice to preach (1s.). From\r\n1680, when Langdale secured the privilege of a separate communion,\r\nshe ceased to contribute to the bread and wine consumed at the parish\r\nchurch celebrations.\r\n\r\nThe ritual of the chapel is disclosed in a Presentment of its wardens\r\nfor 1732, preserved among the general accounts.\r\n\r\nThey have (they say) the Commandments set up within the chapel;\r\na Communion table; linen cloth; patten; flagon and Chalice;\r\nReading-desk and pulpit; a Surplice; books, etc.; with bell and\r\nbell-rope. \"Our minister resides with us; he is not in Holy Orders:\r\nhe reads Prayers and Homilies.\" He is allowed \"the usual salary.\"\r\nSacrament is administered every Easter. Baptisms and marriages are\r\nsolemnized by the curate of Grasmere. No alms are received from the\r\nCommunicants; and they have no alms-box.\r\n\r\nThe separate parochial accounts kept for Langdale continually give\r\nitems for repair and upkeep of the fabric and its adjuncts. One of\r\nthese was a \"common stable,\" doubtless used for the accommodation of\r\nthose who rode to worship. After consultations, the re-building of\r\nthe chapel and school was decided on in 1751, and the work was slowly\r\nproceeded with, at the expense of the township, through the next\r\nthree years. There may have been always a priest's lodging in the\r\nvalley. In 1762 the \"Parson's House\" was repaired for 13s. 3-1/2d.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list--incomplete in its earlier part--of clerks,\r\nreaders, and curates who served the chapel after the Reformation:--\r\n\r\n  William Gollinge \"of The Thrange in Langden, clerk\" had a son\r\n    baptized 1590.\r\n  Charles Middlefell \"clerke of Landale\" died 1643.\r\n  Richard Harrison, clerk; died 1670.       Daniel Green, d. 1829.\r\n  Richard Steele, d. 1780.                  Owen Lloyd, d. 1841.\r\n  Thomas Jackson, d. 1821.                  Stephen Birkett, d. 1860.\r\n  William Jackson, 1821.[179]               James Coward, vicar; 1885.\r\n  Thomas Sewell, 1822.                      R. S. Hulbert, ret. 1900.\r\n\r\n    [179] See page 173, note.\r\n\r\nOwen Lloyd was the son of Charles Lloyd, who was the friend of\r\nCharles Lamb and for some time had resided at old Brathay. He\r\ninherited considerable poetic gifts, and composed the Rushbearing\r\nHymn always sung at the Ambleside Festival. He lived for a while with\r\nhis friend, Mrs. Luff, at Fox Ghyll, Loughrigg.\r\n\r\nRYDAL.--The chapel of St. Mary, Rydal, was built by Lady Fleming in\r\n1824 and consecrated by the Bishop of Chester on August 27th, 1825.\r\nThis new foundation took a large slice out of the old parish, though\r\ncustomary dues and tithes continued for some time to be paid to the\r\nrector. (See later.)\r\n\r\nBRATHAY.--The church, which was built here in 1836 by Mr. Giles\r\nRedmayne, stands on the Lancashire side of the river, but its\r\nparochial boundary took another slice off the old parish, which was\r\nnow wholly robbed of the township of Rydal and Loughrigg.\r\n\r\nSo the old mother church, robbed of her daughter chapels and the\r\nfolk she so long fostered, rules to-day only the little valley of\r\nGrasmere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decorative]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL AND CLERKS\r\n\r\n\r\nLatter-day clerks and schoolmasters present a tangled subject,\r\ndifficult to unravel. Sometimes the clerk taught school. More often\r\nthere was a separate schoolmaster who served as curate, entering\r\nholy orders for the purpose; for by this economy of labour two\r\nmeagre stipends were put together, and the rector might even effect\r\nan economy on the one.[180] Sometimes each of the three offices was\r\nserved by its own functionary; and yet again it seems likely that\r\nthey were occasionally all filled by one man--in which case a deputy\r\nwas hired for the menial work.\r\n\r\n  [180] There were sad doings among the Pluralists and absentee\r\n  parsons of the eighteenth century; and the unpaid curates were\r\n  often addicted to drink. See _Ambleside Town and Chapel_, pp.\r\n  56-7 and onward.\r\n\r\nThe school of Grasmere was doubtless an ancient institution, taught\r\nin days before the Reformation by the resident priest. It is not\r\nunlikely that it would be supervised by the visiting monk from York,\r\nfor monasteries were then the centres of learning. It would, of\r\ncourse, be held within the church, or the porch, according to the\r\nseason, as was the custom. After the Reformation, and during John\r\nWilson's fifty-two years' term as rector, followed by that of the\r\nerratic Royalist, Henry Wilson, tuition must have been a good deal\r\nneglected, or left to the clerk. One Michael Hird was serving as\r\nclerk in 1613, and a Robert of the name in 1638, who may have been a\r\nson, since the office was kept in a family whenever possible. Robert\r\nHird, \"clarke,\" was buried in 1680, which looks like ejection by the\r\nPresbyterians, and subsequent restoration.\r\n\r\nFor we are left in no doubt as to the appointments made by the new\r\nreligious authorities. George Bennison, proud, no doubt, of his\r\noffice and of his smattering of Latin, wrote in the register, \"I\r\nbegan to teache Schoole att Grassmire the 3 day of May 1641 being et\r\nLudimagister et AEdituus.\"[181]\r\n\r\n  [181] From a recent work, _Educational Charters and Documents_,\r\n  by H. F. Leach, we learn that the clergy taught both themselves\r\n  and others from the earliest times; for instance, in the seventh\r\n  century, Aldhelm, writing to the Bishop about his studies, tells\r\n  him how after long struggles he grasped at last, in a moment, by\r\n  God's grace, \"the most difficult of all things, what they call\r\n  fractions.\" In the tenth century a canon of King Edgar enjoins\r\n  that \"every priest in addition to lore to diligently learn a\r\n  handicraft,\" and later in the same century the Council enacted\r\n  that \"priests shall keep schools in the villages and teach small\r\n  boys without charge,\" and also that they ought always to have\r\n  schools for teachers, \"Ludi magistrorum scholas\" in their houses,\r\n  thus they would prepare others to take up the work professionally\r\n  which they were doing for nothing. Five hundred years later we\r\n  find it ordered at Bridgenorth, in 1503, that \"no priste keep no\r\n  scole, after that a scole mastur comyth to town, but that every\r\n  child to resorte to the comyn scole.\" But the plague broke out\r\n  and swept away \"scole masturs\" and pupils alike, and in 1529 the\r\n  Convocation of Canterbury once more bade all rectors, vicars, and\r\n  charity priests to employ some part of their time in teaching\r\n  boys the alphabet, reading, singing, or grammar; and appointed a\r\n  Revision Committee of one archbishop, four bishops, four abbots,\r\n  and four archdeacons to bring out a uniform Latin grammar for\r\n  all schools. That grammar was taught in Latin in the tenth and\r\n  eleventh centuries we know from the Colloquy of OElfric, 1005,\r\n  and from his preface to the first English-Latin grammar, in which\r\n  teachers were told that \"It is better to invoke God the Father\r\n  giving him honour by lengthening the syllable (P[=a]ter) rather\r\n  than cutting it short (P[)a]ter); no, comparing pronunciation as\r\n  is the Britons' way, for God ought not to be subject to the rules\r\n  of grammar.\"\r\n\r\n  ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  From his spelling of the place-name--which never had been\r\n  anything but _Gresmer_--we suspect him to have been a stranger;\r\n  and it would probably be difficult to fill posts on the spot that\r\n  had been summarily made void. Next comes \"Thomas Wilson clarke at\r\n  Gresmere in 1655.\" He it must have been who fought the battle of\r\n  ritual with John Banks, bailiff, before a trembling congregation,\r\n  after the minister Wallas had decamped. (See p. 87.) He, in turn,\r\n  must have lost the post at the Restoration.\r\n\r\n  The Parliament passed a law in 1653 obliging every parish to\r\n  supply a layman for the care of the registers, who was oddly\r\n  called a \"parish-register.\"[182] Accordingly this was done, and\r\n  certified by the non-conformist magnate of Ambleside Hall. \"Bee\r\n  it remembered that John Benson of Gresmere being elected and\r\n  chosen Parish Register of Gresmere by the inhabitants ther was\r\n  approved of and sworne before me the 9th of Aprill 1656.\r\n\r\n  [182] Dr. Fox's _Parish Registers of England_.\r\n\r\nTho: Brathwaite.\"\r\n\r\nJohn kept the office, as an entry in the accounts shows, at least\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\nRector Ambrose, when he left £50 to the parson and \"twenty-four\"\r\nof the parish, in trust for the school, gave an impetus to\r\neducation in the place. The sum--or part of it--may have been used\r\nfor the erection of a school-house. At all events, the quaint\r\nlittle house still standing by the lych-gates was already there\r\nwhen Anthony Dawson, statesman--incited perhaps by the parson's\r\nexample--bequeathed, in 1635, the sum of £7 to a \"School Stock in\r\nGrasmeer.\"[183] He expressly entrusted it to the patron, rector,\r\nand incumbent, \"towards the maintenance of a Schoolmaster teaching\r\nScholars at the School-House built at the Church Yard Yeates in\r\nGresmere.\"[184]\r\n\r\n  [183] The dates of these legacies are incorrectly given on the\r\n  list within the church.\r\n\r\n  [184] Rydal Hall MSS., Grasmere, was by no means behind the times\r\n  in education. There was no parish school at Clayworth, Notts.,\r\n  in 1676, when an independent master was encouraged by permission\r\n  to teach within the church; and an effort made to raise a school\r\n  \"stock\" or endowment failed five years later. See _Rectors' Book\r\n  of Clayworth_.\r\n\r\nThese legacies gave importance to the office of schoolmaster. The\r\nchoice lay then, as now, with the rector and the lay representatives\r\nof the parish, at that time the Eighteen, now only six. The\r\nappointment of young Thomas Knott as schoolmaster, shortly after this\r\naccession of funds, was an excellent one. Curate as well, there is\r\na question as to whether he did not occupy also the post of clerk.\r\nHe was termed clerk in the wardens' accounts, when in 1694 he was\r\npaid 2s. for attending the Visitation and Correction Court. But a\r\nman who could appear at so dignified a function could hardly have\r\nswept out the church, or dug the graves--and these, according to\r\nthe Declaration of the Wardens \"We have no sexton belonging to our\r\nChurch\"--were among the clerk's duties. He may have paid a deputy to\r\ndo these things, since there were perquisites belonging to the post\r\nworth gathering in.\r\n\r\nINCOME OF THE CLERK.--The parish clerk was, in his way, as important\r\na functionary as the parson. Like the rector, he had no fixed salary,\r\nbut took from early times the offerings of the folk, which became\r\nfixed and proportionate, like the tithes. From every \"smoke\" or\r\nhousehold fire, he had one penny a year. For church ceremonials, when\r\nhe acted as Master of the Ceremonies, he received a fixed fee, 2d.\r\nfor a wedding and 4d. for a funeral. He was the accredited news-agent\r\nor advertizer. For instance, when the Rydal and Loughrigg Overseers\r\nwished to put a pauper out to board, in 1796, they gave him 2d. \"for\r\nadvertising her to let.\" (See Tithes.) He was paid 2d. for every\r\nproclamation in church or yard.\r\n\r\nThese ancient fixed fees lessened in value through the centuries,\r\nas did the tithes. Various small emoluments however became attached\r\nto the post as time went on. If the clerk was a good penman--as he\r\nwas certain to be when acting as pedagogue--he might be employed on\r\nthe church writings. Besides the joint Presentments, charged at 2s.\r\n6d. (of which Grasmere and Langdale paid 1s. each and Rydal with\r\nLoughrigg 6d.), there were the wardens' accounts to be drawn up, at a\r\nfee rising by degrees from 3s. to 5s.; as well as a fair copy to be\r\nmade into the large register-book from the parson's pocket-register.\r\nThis last duty--oft, alas! negligently performed--was long rewarded\r\nby 1s. annual payment, which afterwards rose to 3s. 6d. These items\r\noccur in the accounts:--\r\n\r\n                                                          £ s. d.\r\n  1672--\"For writting ye burialls Christenings and\r\n        Mariages out ye Register Bookes 2 times\"         00  2 00\r\n\r\n  1675--\"Itt. for writting a coppy out of ye Regester\r\n  Book etc                                              £00  2 00\"\r\n\r\n  1790--\"To writing Marriage Register 1s. 0d. to\r\n  drawing Copy of Register 2s. 6d.\"\r\n\r\nThe contract for bell-ringing was given to the clerk, and doubtless\r\nhe secured a profit upon it. He had an annual payment for lighting\r\nthe vestry fire; another (5s.) for \"attending\" the hearse. In 1822\r\nthe accounts give--after an item for \"cleaning\" the church-yard and\r\nwindows:--\r\n\r\n     \"To Ditto Sentences and Window and Church throughout self and\r\n     Boy\" 7s. 6d.\r\n\r\nThis was clearly not a school-master clerk, who enjoyed--instead\r\nof receipts from menial labour--the scholars' pence and the small\r\nstipend. If we turn back to enumerate the men who served the office,\r\nwe find Robert Harrison (1695 to 1713) followed by Anthony Harrison.\r\n\r\nThere was no clerk in 1729, according to the presentment. Gawen\r\nMackereth (1736 to 1756) is entered as \"clarke and schoolmaster,\"\r\nthough he certainly entered holy orders; so he may possibly, with a\r\ndeputy, have combined the three offices. John Cautley was clerk in\r\n1756.\r\n\r\nAfter this came three generations of Mackereths: George of Knott\r\nHouses; the second George, who filled the office from 1785 to his\r\ndeath, at 81, in 1832; and David, his son. These men were clerks,\r\npure and simple.[185] David pursued the calling of a gardener,\r\nworking for Mr. Greenwood at the Wyke. In his time it was decided to\r\ngive the clerk a salary. It began in 1845 at £4, and was advanced in\r\n1854 to £5, with the stipulation, however, that one J. Airey should\r\nreceive 13s. 6d. of it. But David did not prosper, and he emigrated\r\nto Australia in 1856. He is remembered by Miss Greenwood as a tall,\r\nfine man, like his successor; he used, after giving out the psalm to\r\nthe congregation at the desk, to march into the singing-pew (which\r\nstood where the organ is) and there lead the voices. Indeed, the\r\nparish clerk of old, besides a tuneful voice, was generally endowed\r\nwith a fine presence. The family is spoken of in an old newspaper\r\nof nearly a year ago. Grasmere, December 31st, 1909: \"Death of a\r\nnoted Guide.--Last week there died at Grasmere one of the best known\r\nguides in the district, and one of the best known characters in\r\nhis day--John Mackereth. He was descended from a very old family\r\nof Grasmere statesmen, intimately connected with Grasmere Church\r\nin three generations of parish clerks, and earlier still as 'Ludi\r\nmagister et clericus.' The Rev. Gawin Mackereth held these offices\r\nfrom 1736 to 1756. George Mackereth, of Knott Houses, parish clerk,\r\nwas buried July 23rd, 1785. His son George became parish clerk, and\r\nwas buried 22nd October, 1832, aged 81 years. He was succeeded by his\r\nson, David Mackereth, who held the office up to the fifties. David's\r\nson, George, was much disappointed that he was not chosen clerk after\r\nhis father's time. He was a tailor, and also a noted guide. He died\r\nin 1881, and Johnny as he was always called took his place as guide.\r\nHe was also boatman in Mr. Brown's days at the Prince of Wales Hotel.\r\nIn these capacities he was known to hundreds of visitors, who never\r\ncame to Grasmere without looking him up. Of late years he worked on\r\nthe roads for the council. He was great on wrestling, and for many\r\nyears collected money for prizes at the rush-bearing. He had no\r\nchildren, but four brothers and three sisters, all of whom have left\r\nGrasmere, survive him.\" One Brian Mackereth was, in 1677, ranked\r\namong the Freeman Tanners of the City of Kendal. (_Boke of Recorde_.)\r\nIn the same year Squire Daniel gave 5s. \"at ye Collection of Brian\r\nMackereth's Houseburning.\" James Airey, the next clerk (1856 to\r\n1862), must have been a clever, ingenious man, for he kept the clock\r\nin order from 1831. He was also appointed schoolmaster--an office\r\nthat had often changed hands, and been united with the curacy--and\r\nEdward Wilson was taught by him (along with the younger De Quincey\r\nchildren) until he went with his brother to the Ambleside school.\r\n\r\n  [185] The Mackereths made no pretention to learning, and Robert\r\n  Pooley or Powley acted as school-master after the Revd. Noble\r\n  Wilson in Sir Richard Fleming's time, and he was keeping the\r\n  registers in 1814.\r\n\r\nThe school, meanwhile, had received other benefactions. The church\r\nlist records £80 given by William Waters, of Thorneyhow, in 1796,\r\ntowards the master's salary; and good Mrs. Dorothy Knott followed\r\nthis, in 1812, by £100, the interest of which was to be spent on the\r\neducation of five Grasmere children, born of poor and industrious\r\nparents. John Watson, yeoman and smith, made a similar bequest in\r\n1852, stipulating that the recipients should be chosen annually by\r\nthe trustees of the school. In 1847 Mr. Vincent G. Dowley gave £10.\r\n\r\nWhile the salary of the master was paid out of the school \"stock\"\r\nor endowment, the township took upon itself the maintenance of the\r\nschool-house; and the expenses were duly entered in the accounts\r\nof the Grasmere \"Third.\" The waller of those days was differently\r\nremunerated from the workman of these. For instance, the large\r\nstatement of 1729 \"For mending the School-house\" is followed by the\r\nsmall sum of 14s. 6d. Naturally the windows wanted \"glassing\" from\r\ntime to time. Occasionally new forms were procured--four in 1781 cost\r\n5s. 4d.; or a new table, in 1805.\r\n\r\nA loft or upper floor was constructed in the small house in 1782, the\r\nopportunity apparently being taken when the Grasmere township had\r\nbought an oak-tree for the renewal of their decayed benches in the\r\nchurch, and while workmen were on the spot. The expences stand as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                                                           s. d.\r\n  24 ft. of oak boards for school-loft at 3d. per ft.       6  0\r\n\r\n  8-1/2 days carpenter laying school loft                  14  0\r\n\r\n  1000 nails for the same                                   4  6\r\n\r\n  2 Jammers for door and some hair                          1  0\r\n\r\nThe little house, so stoutly built and prudently kept up, remains\r\nthe same, only that partitions have been erected for rooms, and the\r\nentrance has been changed from the church-yard to the outer side. The\r\ncupboard where the boys kept their books, the pump where they washed\r\ntheir hands, may still be seen. School was held within its walls till\r\n1855, when the present schools were built.\r\n\r\nWith James Airey, who acted as both, the record of former\r\nschoolmasters and clerks may be closed. But one who, appointed in\r\n1879, served the office of verger (substituted for clerk) up to 1906,\r\nmust be mentioned. Edward Wilson was son of the carpenter of the same\r\nname, and he pursued the craft himself. No custodian of old could\r\nhave filled the office with greater reverence or dignity, nor graced\r\nit by a finer presence. Intelligent, calm, quietly humourous, he was\r\nalso gifted with an accurate memory of the events of his youth; and\r\nhis death, in 1910, at the age of 88 seems truly to have shut to\r\nfinally the door of Grasmere's past.\r\n\r\n[Illstration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH RATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe church rate, levied by the wardens and the Eighteen on the\r\nparishioners for the up-keep of the church, must for long have\r\nstood at a low figure. In Squire Daniel's Account-book for February\r\n16-62/63 the item appears \"Paid ye other day an Assess to ye church\r\nfor my little tenem^t in Gressmer 00 00 02.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a small farm-hold at the Wray, which he had inherited from\r\nhis uncle. And forty years later, when the year's expenditure was\r\nhigh, the freeholder, Francis Benson of the Fold, was rated no higher\r\nthan 5s. 9d. for all his lands. The general charges after 1662, when\r\nthe equipment for the episcopal services was complete, up to 1810,\r\naveraged in those years when there was no extraordinary outlay,\r\nbarely more than £2, to which, of course, were added those incurred\r\nby each township individually. In 1733, when the bells caused a great\r\noutlay, it is possible that money was borrowed, for an item stands\r\n\"For interest to Jane Benson 5s. 0d.\" Rydal and Loughrigg furnished,\r\nin 1661, the sum of £2. 9s. as its share in the maintenance of the\r\nchurch; and in 1682, £1. 5s. 6d.; while in 1733 it mounted to £13.\r\n3s. 7d., of which the special Ambleside churchwarden produced, on\r\nbehalf of his district, 19s. 1d.\r\n\r\nWhen the churchwardens' books re-open in 1790, the general charges\r\nstand at £2. 2s. 7-1/2d., and those of the three townships united\r\nat £7. 13s. 2-1/2d.; our township paying of this £2. 2s. 1d. The\r\nfollowing table shows the progress of expense:--\r\n\r\n          Complete Charges   Share paid by\r\n            of Three         Loughrigg and\r\n           Townships.        beneath Moss.

In the year of the great outlay\r\nupon the roof (1814), when Rydal produced £35. 19s. 11d. and £14.\r\n7s. 4d. from Ambleside, the wardens laid for the last time but one,\r\nthe old church rate or \"sess.\" Henceforth, the Overseers of the Poor\r\ntook it over, and so long as it lasted paid it out of the Poor Rate.\r\nThis seems to have been a period of laxity, when the old spirit of\r\nresponsibility and watchful care in the custodians of the building,\r\nas representatives of their townships, became weakened. It was now,\r\nin 1816, when the wardens and Eighteen would seem to have less to do,\r\nthat an annual dinner was instituted for them and the \"minister.\"\r\nThis cost 2s. a head; and though at the Easter Meeting of 1849 \"it\r\nwas resolved that in future the Landlord at the Red Lion Inn shall\r\nprovide dinners for the 24 at the Rate of 1s. 6d. p^r Head, Ale also\r\nto be Included in the said Sum,\" the sum paid remained £2.\r\n\r\nA fee of 1s. 4d. paid to the churchwardens on entry or exit from\r\noffice (which covered his journey to Kendal) had long been customary.\r\nBesides this fee, his expenses began in 1826 to be paid separately at\r\nthe rate of 3s.\r\n\r\nBut the old order, long decrepit, was soon to be wiped out. Strangers\r\nwere pressing into the remote valley, which Gray had found in\r\n1769 without one single gentleman's residence. Not only poets and\r\nliterary men began to settle in it, but rich men from cities, who\r\nbought up the old holdings of statesmen and built \"mansions\" upon\r\nthem. These men demanded accommodation in the old parish church of\r\na kind befitting their notions of dignity. Opposition seems to have\r\nbeen made to their demands. It is not quite easy to discover, from\r\nthe account given in the churchwardens' book of the meetings held\r\nabout the matter in 1856 and 1857, where the difficulty lay. We may\r\nsurmise, however, that while the seats in the Grasmere division of\r\nthe church were full to overflowing, those belonging to the other\r\ntownships would be often vacant, since not only the old Chapels of\r\nAmbleside and Langdale were in use for regular worship and communion,\r\nbut new ones were built for Rydal and Brathay. It is possible that\r\nan attempt to sweep away the traditional divisions and put Grasmere\r\nfolk in Langdale or Loughrigg seats produced the dead-lock we read\r\nof. At all events, a vestry meeting was held on July 24th, 1856, with\r\nthe Rev. Sir Richard Fleming in the chair, \"to consider the propriety\r\nof making such an arrangement with respect to the free and open\r\nsittings in the church as may conduce to the general convenience of\r\nthe inhabitants; and preparatory to an allotment by the churchwardens\r\nof such free and open Sittings among the parishioners in proportion\r\nto their several requirements, due regard being had to all customary\r\nSittings and to the rights of persons, having property in pews.\"\r\nThis proposal was made by Mr. Tremenhere and seconded by Captain\r\nPhilipps, both new-comers, though the latter (who had opened the\r\nHydropathic Establishment at the Wray) seems to have been chosen as\r\none of the Eighteen; and it was promptly negatived by a majority of\r\nnineteen to four. Mr. Thomas H. Marshall, another new resident, at\r\nwhose instigation the matter had been begun, persisted in it however;\r\nand the two wardens for Grasmere agreed to take lawyer's counsel\r\nas to their action in carrying out a Faculty already procured, and\r\nfor which they paid Dr. Twiss £3. 6s. This counsel is not very\r\nclear, but paragraph ii. of its text is of interest: \"I think that\r\nthe appropriation of any number of pews in a Mass to the separate\r\ntownships, so as to exclude permanently the Inhabitants of the\r\nparish in general from the use of them, would be a proceeding in\r\ncontradiction to the express provisions of the Faculty. The Faculty\r\nmust be taken to have superseded any antecedent custom under which\r\npews in a mass were appropriated to separate townships. I think it\r\nis the duty of the Churchwardens to assign to such parishioners\r\nas shall apply from time to time, indiscriminately as regards the\r\ntownships, pews or seats, as the case may be, among the free and open\r\nsittings.\" Again, after expressing his opinion that the burden of\r\nthe church rate should fall on the inhabitants in general, he speaks\r\nof \"the custom for the townships to repair their own portions of the\r\nChurch applied to the Church in the state in which it was, and under\r\nthe exceptional arrangements of the Sittings which existed prior to\r\nthe issuing of the Faculty.... The manner of collecting the rate by\r\nthe officers of the townships may still hold good, but the rule of\r\nassessment must, I think, be derived from the general law.\"\r\n\r\nThe Archdeacon was likewise applied to by Mr. Marshall and Mr.\r\nStephen Heelis, a lawyer from Manchester, who had bought a holding\r\nat Above Beck, and had built himself a house there. He was an able\r\nman, and at once took a prominent part in the proceedings. He was\r\nmade churchwarden for Grasmere, and with his colleague, William\r\nWilson, set to work in 1857 upon the unrestricted allotment of seats\r\ncountenanced by the authorities. This was the end of the individual\r\nshares held by the townships in the fabric of the old mother church;\r\nit was the end of the Eighteen who had represented the township; it\r\nwas an end, likewise, of the general church rate for which those\r\nEighteen stood responsible; since it was manifestly unfair to tax\r\nthose whose rights had been taken away. Langdale fell away, and the\r\nBrathay part of Loughrigg, and Ambleside-above-Stock. The rate of\r\n1-1/2d. in the £ on property, which the wardens proceeded to levy on\r\nthe whole of the parishioners, was responded to for the last time\r\nin 1858, when Ambleside paid £7, Rydal and Loughrigg £10 17s. 10d.,\r\nand Langdale £8 6s. 3d., to Grasmere's £13 14s. 11-3/4d. The little\r\ndivision of Rydal with part of Loughrigg was indeed, by dint of its\r\nbeing dubbed a chapelry, held yet a little longer in the grasp of\r\nthe old church; four statesmen and one warden were allowed her in\r\nreturn for the rate she continued to pay. This she seems at first\r\nto have paid equally with Grasmere, and in 1859 she contributed\r\nthe high figure of £15 0s. 10-1/2d. towards the expenses of the\r\nchurch. In 1861 she paid £13 5s. 1-1/2d. By 1866, however, the rate\r\nto supply the immensely increased expenses of worship had become a\r\nburden, even to Grasmere folk. A voluntary rate took its place, and\r\nRydal contributed its unspecified portion to this for the last time\r\nin 1870. The offertory that then superseded all rates, paid only by\r\nworshippers, was an immediate success.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, when the volume of accounts closes, the year's expenditure\r\nstands at £155 14s. 1d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-RATEPAYERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe religious factions--whether Baptist, Anabaptist, Independent\r\nor Presbyterian--that had sprung up during the Commonwealth left\r\nbehind them no vital seeds of dissent in the wide parish of Grasmere,\r\nalthough the two last had in turn held the rectorate and the pulpit.\r\nAs soon, indeed, as the Episcopal Church was restored, along with the\r\nMonarchy, the people returned with apparently a willing mind, and\r\nalmost unanimously, to the old order of worship.\r\n\r\nThere was an exception, however, to be found in the Quakers, who were\r\nfirm in refusing to re-enter the Church. George Fox, wandering on\r\nfoot like an old Celtic missionary, had made his appearance in these\r\nparts in 1653, and at once his preaching (which mirrored his mystic\r\nand simple mind), united with a magnetic personality, had secured\r\nhim a following. His teaching discountenanced all creeds, forms, and\r\nritual. His meetings were, therefore, held in private houses; and\r\nso much abhorred by his followers was the \"steeple-house\" with its\r\nconsecrated ground, as well as any fixed form of service (even the\r\nOffice for the Burial of the Dead), that they often laid their dead\r\nin silence in their own garden-ground, rather than carry them to the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nAs the little band grew larger, a plot of ground was, however,\r\nsecured as early as 1658 at Colthouse, near Hawkshead, in Lancashire,\r\nas a graveyard[187]; and in that neighbourhood, where they built a\r\nmeeting-house in 1688,[188] they became numerous and active; and on\r\nthe Westmorland side of the Brathay--in Langdale and in Loughrigg\r\nmore especially--George Fox also found adherents. In particular,\r\nFrancis Benson, freeholder of the Fold, of a wealthy family of\r\nclothiers, and an influential man who served as Presbyterian elder in\r\n1646, became his follower; and remained so through the persecutions.\r\nHe received Fox into his house, even when the preacher had become a\r\nmarked man. Fox's _Journal_, after recording his Keswick preachings\r\nin 1663, runs on:--\r\n\r\n  [187] Hawkshead Parish Register.\r\n\r\n  [188] From Mr. William Satterthwaite, of Colthouse, a member of\r\n  the Society of Friends.\r\n\r\n     We went that night to one Francis Benson's in Westmorland; near\r\n     Justice Fleming's House. This Justice Fleming was at that time\r\n     in a great Rage against Friends, and me in particular; insomuch\r\n     that in the open Sessions at Kendal just before, he had bid Five\r\n     Pounds to any Man, that should take me; that Francis Benson told\r\n     me. And it seems as I went to this Friend's House, I met one Man\r\n     coming from the Sessions, that had this Five Pounds offered him\r\n     to take me, and he knew me; for as I passed by him, he said to\r\n     his Companion, That is George Fox: Yet he had not power to touch\r\n     me: for the Lord's power preserved me over all.\r\n\r\nThe fanatical spirit of Fox is shown perhaps in this passage, where\r\nhe ascribes the inaction of these two parishioners of Grasmere, not\r\nto a generous tolerance of mind (certainly God-given), but to a\r\ndirect interposition of Providence in his own favour. He likewise\r\nattributes the death of the Squire's good and gentle wife later on to\r\nGod's wrath and judgment upon the husband for his persecution of the\r\nFriends.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Squire Daniel was not the man to view leniently the\r\nopposition offered by the new sect to the restoration of the old form\r\nof worship. It must be allowed that the method of their preachers\r\nwas not only irritating but provocative; for it was their wont,\r\nwhen the congregation was assembled in the \"steeple-house\" to rise\r\nand denounce both worship and officiating clergy as instruments of\r\nBelial; with an occasional result of rough handling and ejection by\r\nthe people. We have seen that William Wilson, a Langdale man and one\r\nof their speakers, resorted to this method of interruption when the\r\nChurch of England service was restored in the chapel. The parson of\r\nWindermere later on wrote to Squire Daniel begging his magisterial\r\nhelp, as a woman was in the habit of rising during worship and\r\ndenouncing him. Wilson's misdemeanour was immediately dealt with at\r\nthe Quarter Sessions, and on his refusing to swear the oath--a matter\r\nof principle with the Quakers, which was not rightly understood,\r\nand which made their offence a political one--was thrown into gaol,\r\nwhere, if his fine of a hundred marks was not paid in six weeks, he\r\nwas to remain for six months, and to be brought again before the\r\nmagistrates.[189]\r\n\r\n  [189] Indictment Book, Kendal Quarter Sessions.\r\n\r\nThis was certainly a severe judgment. How the case ended is not\r\napparent, nor how long Wilson remained in prison. A letter exists\r\nat Rydal Hall, addressed to \"Justice fleeming\" and signed L.M.,\r\nreproaching him for his treatment of the Quakers, especially of\r\nthe four now in prison. One of these is \"Wm. Willson, thy poore\r\nneighbour,\" of whose wife and children the Squire is admonished to\r\nhave a care, since the prisoner had little but what he got by his\r\nhands--a statement which implies that Wilson was a craftsman.\r\n\r\nThe Rydal Squire had at first believed that he could force the\r\nFriends back to the common worship in the old parish church by means\r\nof fines, for he had the frugal man's belief that the pocket can\r\nbe made to act upon the conscience. With the passing of the Act of\r\nUniformity (1662) and the later Conventicle and Five Mile Acts,\r\nhowever, he and his fellow magistrates had a powerful legal hold over\r\nthem. It is clear that he caused the known Quakers of the parish\r\nto be watched. One, James Russell, brought him word that there had\r\nbeen a meeting on November 1st, 1663, at the house of John Benson,\r\nof Stang End. This was on the Lancashire side of Little Langdale\r\nbeck, but the Westmorland folk who attended were Francis Benson, his\r\nson Bernard, \"Regnhold\" Holme, Michael Wilson, and Barbara Benson.\r\nOf Lancashire folk there were only Giles Walker, wright, who had\r\nwalked from Hawkshead, and William Wilson and his wife. Wilson was\r\nthe speaker, so his imprisonment had not damped his ardour. Again,\r\nnext year, the constable of Grasmere, Thomas Braithwaite, and a\r\nchurchwarden, Robert Grigge, gave evidence that certain Quakers had\r\nbeen seen returning from Giles Walker's house near Hawkshead; and\r\namong them were William Harrison, of Langdale, and Edward Hird, of\r\nGrasmere.\r\n\r\nThese doings were not passed over by the Squire. He even tried\r\nconclusions with the most powerful of the sect, Francis Benson, of\r\nthe Fold, and accordingly the latter was summoned, in 1663, along\r\nwith his wife Dorothy, to appear at the Quarter Sessions to answer\r\nthe charge of having been present at a meeting. The penalty of\r\nnon-appearance was a fine of thirty shillings, while the fines of\r\nJohn Dixon and William Harrison, both of Langdale, charged with the\r\nsame offence, were respectively twenty shillings and ten shillings.\r\nFrancis Benson probably cleared his legal mis-demeanours by money\r\npayments, for no evidence has been found of his imprisonment. He\r\nand his family, however, remained staunch Friends. The place of his\r\nsepulchre is not known, though his death is recorded for February,\r\n1673, of \"Fould in Loughrig,\" in the Quaker Registers. There is a\r\ntradition of a burying-ground at the Fold, somewhere about his now\r\nvanished homestead, and it is quite possible that some members of the\r\nfamily might be buried there, as the early Friends not infrequently\r\nmade a grave-plot on their own ground. The Fold was so much a\r\ncentre of the sect that a marriage took place there between William\r\nSatterthwaite, of Colthouse, and the daughter of Giles Walker, of\r\nWalker Ground, Hawkshead, on December 11th, 1661.[190] According to\r\nanother tradition, a Baptist Meeting-house stood at the Fold, and\r\nan old man, named Atkinson, whose forbears had owned the adjacent\r\nfarmhold of the Crag--where he was then living--pointed out the exact\r\nspot on a little triangle by the road where the building had stood,\r\nand the \"Dipping\" took place. But this story is against all record,\r\nfor we can trace the Bensons' adherence to the Friends to a late\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n  [190] Papers of the Satterthwaite family.\r\n\r\nA large number of Quakers travelled to Rydal in 1681 to make their\r\nTest or Declaration before Squire Daniel and his son, but the only\r\nfolk of the parish among them were Bernard Benson, of Loughrigg, and\r\nJane his wife, and \"Regnald\" Holme, of Clappersgate, and his wife\r\nJane.\r\n\r\nIn 1684 a Rydal man \"presented\" before the justices quite a concourse\r\nof people who had been present at a \"Conventicle\" in Langdale. Some\r\nseventeen Loughrigg and Langdale names were cited: Edward Benson of\r\nHigh Close (his only appearance as a Dissenter), John Dixon of Rosset\r\nin Langdale, William and James Harryson of Harry Place, \"Regnald\" and\r\nJane Holme of Loughrigg, James Holme, the Willsons of Langdale, etc.\r\n\r\nReginald Holme's name frequently appears in the Indictment Book\r\nof the Quarter Sessions, and generally in connection with secular\r\ndisputes. He was, in fact, a turbulent character, little fitted to\r\nbelong to the peace-loving sect, which he joined possibly from sheer\r\nlove of dissent. Some items of his history have been given elsewhere.\r\nHe owned the mill at Skelwith Bridge--probably then, as later, a\r\ncorn-mill, though it is extremely likely that a walk-mill would be\r\nset up additionally on this fine flow of water. About this water\r\nand other matters he was in constant dispute with his neighbours.\r\nOne altercation, with a certain Thomas Rawlingson, the Friends\r\ntried to settle for him but as he refused to accept their verdict,\r\na resolution was passed at a Monthly Meeting, held at Swathmoor\r\n(1676), that the law might now take its course. On another occasion\r\nReginald was brought up before the Magistrates for assault; but the\r\nrecurring bone of contention was a dam or weir which he had built\r\nacross the river for the good of his mill--and to the damage, it\r\nwas declared, of the pathway above, and of his neighbours' grounds.\r\nThe Rydal Squire twice headed a party for the forcible destruction\r\nof this dam, as has been told[191]; but long afterwards Holme was\r\nin fierce conflict with Michael Satterthwaite, of Langdale, yeoman,\r\nabout this or another dam.[192] Finally, in 1684, a crisis occurred,\r\nand Reginald's goods were seized by the strong arm of the law--a most\r\nunwonted proceeding; on which occasion his sons and his daughter fell\r\nupon the unfortunate officers, and beat them and put them forth with\r\nviolence--which made another indictable offence.\r\n\r\n  [191] _Transactions_, Cumb. and West. Ant. So., vol. 6, N.S.\r\n\r\n  [192] Indictment Book.\r\n\r\nAfter the law-suit concerning the tithes, which followed upon\r\nthe Restoration (see ante), in which law-suit Francis Benson was\r\nconcerned, and possibly other Quakers, we have no evidence as to\r\nwhether the sect continued to oppose the payment of church scot.\r\nBut there is abundant evidence to show that they were resolute in\r\nnon-attendance at church, and in refusal to pay the church rate or\r\n\"sess\" levied on the townships for the upkeep of the fabric and its\r\nwalls by the representative men of the parish. The Subsidy Rolls\r\nof 1675 show that Francis Benson paid for himself and his wife\r\nDorothy the tax of 1s. 4d., which the Government demanded from all\r\nnon-communicants, as did \"Reynald\" Holme for self and wife, and John\r\nBenson of Langdale.\r\n\r\nFrom wardens' accounts and presentments we gain many particulars of\r\nthe dissenters of the parish, who appear to diminish in number as\r\ntime goes on. It had become necessary by 1694 to account, in the\r\nbooks, for the deficit caused by the Friends' non-payment; and though\r\nin the following year two of them yielded, Bernard Benson paying up\r\nthe large arrears of 15s. 11d. for \"Church: Sess,\" and Jacob Holme\r\n7s. 6d., the \"Allowance for Dissenters\" appears each year on the\r\ndebit side.\r\n\r\nPresentments are only available from 1702.

As the old families died out or dispersed, no\r\nnew adherents of the sect appear to have arisen in the parish, and\r\ndissent ceased.\r\n\r\nThe only comment on non-conformity found in the registers occurs in\r\nthe second volume (1687-1713). It runs:--\r\n\r\n     A perticular Register of some pretended Marryages of the people\r\n     called Quakers within the parish of Grasmere As followeth--\r\n\r\nBut only two weddings from Great Langdale are set down. Also is\r\nentered:--\r\n\r\n     Jane daughter of John Grigge of Stile End in Great Langdale was\r\n     baptized by A prebyterian minister the tenth day of Aprill Ano\r\n     Dom 1710.\r\n\r\nThe \"minister\" so clearly obnoxious to the registrar may have been a\r\nvisitor to the valley.\r\n\r\nWhen a stranger entered the church in 1827 and asked the clerk if\r\nthere were any Dissenters in the neighbourhood, he was told that\r\nthere were none nearer than Keswick, where were some who called\r\nthemselves Presbyterians; and of these the clerk professed so little\r\nknowledge that he hazarded the suggestion that they were a kind\r\nof \"papishes.\" The clerk aforesaid was old George Mackereth,[193]\r\nforgetful alike of the Colthouse Meeting-House and the small Baptist\r\nChapel at Hawkshead Hill, built in 1678? For about the first\r\nclustered a few families who clung to the faith of their fathers;\r\nthough the latter (of which little seems to be known) may have\r\ndropped out of use.\r\n\r\n  [193] Hone's _Table Book_.\r\n\r\nDissent had never existed in Ambleside. The men of that town, who\r\nmanaged the affairs of their chapel, had no real leanings towards\r\nit, and the Restoration found them all churchmen again. The only man\r\nof the town-division who could be taxed as a non-communicant in 1675\r\nwas Roger Borwick, and he was a disreputable inn-keeper at Miller\r\nBridge, a Roman Catholic who had once been a personal servant of the\r\nill-fated heir of Squire John Fleming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Little Bell\r\n\r\nRECAST AT THE EXPENCE OF MRS DOROTHY KNOTT, 1809 T. MEARS & SON\r\nOF LONDON FECIT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REGISTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early registers are contained in three parchment books. The\r\nfirst measures 15 inches by 7, and has a thickness of 1 inch. It was\r\nre-bound recently in white vellum, and an expert has endeavoured\r\nto restore the almost vanished characters of the first page. The\r\nearliest legible entries are for January 1570-71. The sheets may have\r\nonce got loose and some lost, for there is a complete gap between\r\nthe years 1591-98, and another between 1604-11. There are minor gaps\r\nbesides, which, perhaps, may be explained by the system of register\r\nkeeping that obtained in these parts. A smaller book for entries was\r\nkept, called a pocket-register, in which the minister (or the clerk)\r\nnoted down the ceremonies as they occurred; and these were copied\r\nfrom time to time into the larger book. It was a system that, in the\r\nhands of careless officials, produced nothing short of disaster, as\r\nfar as parochial history is considered. The re-entry, long over-due,\r\nhad often not been made, before the pocket-register was mis-placed\r\nor lost. In times of stress, like those of the plague-years, the\r\nchurch officials seem to have become paralized, and ceased to cope\r\nfor months at a time with the registration of the dead. For instance,\r\nin the deadly year 1577, February, April, May and July are blank;\r\neight burials are then entered for August, and none for the rest of\r\nthe year. Again, next year, eight deaths are recorded for July, nine\r\nfor September, and twelve for November, while the intervening and\r\nsucceeding months are blank. This state of things continues through\r\nthe years of oft-returning plague that followed, and through the\r\nlong rectorate of John Wilson, diversified by the occasional loss\r\nof a page or a mysterious skip, _e.g._, in marriages there is a gap\r\nbetween the years 1583-4 and 1611--more than 27 years.[194]\r\n\r\n  [194] The following list of omissions in the earliest Grasmere\r\n  Church Register, 1570-1687, has been kindly supplied by Miss H.\r\n  J. H. Sumner.--ED. \"No Marriages between ffeb. 1583-4 and June\r\n  1611; no Burials between July 1588 and May 1598; no Christenings\r\n  between Dec. 1591 and ffeb. 1600-1; no Burials between May 1604\r\n  and Apr. 1611; no Christenings between March 1603-4 and Apr.\r\n  1611; no Christenings between ffeb. 1625-8 and June 1627; no\r\n  Marriages between July 1625 and May 1627; no Burials between\r\n  ffeb. 1625-6 and May 1627.\"\r\n\r\nThe first register-book is, therefore, a disappointing document, from\r\nwhich no satisfactory conclusions as to population or death-rate\r\ncan be drawn, nor adequate information concerning families or\r\nindividuals. The Hawkshead register-book is a complete contrast to\r\nthis one, in neatness and fulness; and the scribe has marked with\r\na cross all deaths from plague. Maybe the grammar-school there,\r\nwith its master, affected favourably the records of the parish. In\r\nGrasmere the school was, after the Reformation, left in general to\r\nthe parish clerk. This first book shows signs, like the Curate's\r\nBible of Ambleside, of having been accessible to the scholars--no\r\ndoubt while these were yet taught in the church; for experiments in\r\npenmanship and signatures occur on blank spaces, which were seized\r\nupon with avidity by the learner--parchment and paper being hard to\r\ncome by.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the third register-book is wholly satisfactory. It\r\nis in its original binding, but the clasps have gone. It measures\r\n16-1/2 inches by 7, with a thickness of 3 inches. Its title runs,\r\n\"Grasmere's Register Book, from May the 7th, A.D., 1713. Henry\r\nFleming, D.D., Rector; Mr. Dudley Walker, Curate; Anthony Harrison,\r\nParish Clerk.\" The book closes in December, 1812. As in the earlier\r\nvolumes, the baptisms and marriages are written on the left page, and\r\nburials on the right. The first entry is a receipt from the man who\r\nfurnished the book:--\r\n\r\n                    June ye 21, 1713.                 lb.   s.  d.\r\n\r\n  Recd. of ye Reverend Dr. Fleming one Pound and\r\n    Eleven Shillings for ye Parchmt. wherwth. this\r\n    Book is made for ye clasps eightpence and for ye\r\n    Binding Six Shillings.

The first\r\nhas caused considerable surprise, and it is of interest on three\r\nscores. It shows that the solemnization of the rite had been long\r\nneglected--the Bishop of Chester no doubt finding this remote parish\r\nof his diocese very inconvenient to reach, and relegating it on this\r\noccasion to his brother of Carlisle, who but recently was its rector.\r\nIt likewise proves that the population was larger then than in the\r\nnext century, and that the estimate of the number of communicants\r\ngiven on a preceding page was under, rather than over, stated. It\r\nillustrates the fact, besides, that the old forms would accommodate\r\nat least twice the number of the present benches.\r\n\r\n     October the 23, 1737.\r\n\r\n     A Confirmation was then holden at this Church by the Right\r\n     Reverend Father in God Sr. George Fleming Baronet Lord Bishop\r\n     of Carlisle at the instance of the Lord Bishop of Chester at\r\n     which time and place About five Hundred Persons were Confirmed.\r\n     [The next confirmation recorded is in 1862.]\r\n\r\nAn entry on the first page, in fine hand-writing, is likewise of\r\ninterest, as showing that long after the Reformation, and even after\r\nthe Prayer Book revision of 1662, the prohibition of the old Sarum\r\nManual against marriages taking place during the three great feasts\r\nof Christmas, Easter and Penticost still had weight, though it could\r\nnot be enforced, and that the rector--a stout churchman--desired its\r\nobservance.\r\n\r\n     Marriages Prohibited from Advent Sunday till a Week after the\r\n     Epiphany, from Septuagesima Sunday till a Week after Easter,\r\n     from Ascension day till trinity Sunday; Secundum Dr. Comber.[195]\r\n\r\n  [195] The reference is to the Dean of Durham's _Companion to the\r\n  Temple_, the standard work of the period on the Prayer-Book; but\r\n  the passage goes no further than to say that \"some among us\"\r\n  still observe the \"former\" prohibition.\r\n\r\nCurious entries, or any bearing upon local history, such as are\r\nfrequent in some registers, are scarce in the Grasmere books. The law\r\nthat commanded the use of woollen for shrouds, by way of propping up\r\na declining industry, caused the usual amount of trouble here in the\r\nway of affidavits and entries.\r\n\r\nAnother enactment, that all sickly persons who presented themselves\r\nfor cure by the Royal touch--a remedy much resorted to under the\r\nStuarts--were to come armed with a parochial certificate,[196] has\r\nleft its trace here.\r\n\r\n  [196] Dr. Cox's Parish Registers.\r\n\r\n     Wee the Rector and Churchwardens of the Parish of Grasmere in\r\n     the County of Westmorland do hereby certify that David Harrison\r\n     of the said Parish aged about fourteen years is afflicted as wee\r\n     are credibly informed with the disease comonly called the Kings\r\n     Evill; and (to the best of o^r knowledge) hath not hereto fore\r\n     been touched by His Majesty for ye s^d.

Ano Dom 1681.\"\r\n\r\nAn instance of longevity is given in 1674, when widow Elizabeth\r\nWalker, of Underhelme, \"dyed at ye age of 107 years old.\"\r\n\r\nBut the entry that has caused the most comment is one that\r\ncommemorates a boating disaster on Windermere Lake. Forty-seven\r\npersons were drowned, with some seven horses: \"in one boate comeinge\r\nover from Hawkshead\" on October 20th, 1635. Singularly enough, this\r\nis the only known record of an event with which tradition and later\r\nstory has been busy. These affirm that the boat-load consisted\r\nof a wedding-party; also that the corpses were buried under a\r\nyew-tree in Windermere church-yard. If the catastrophe happened to\r\nthe customery ferry, known as Great Boat, plying between Hawkshead\r\nRoad and Ferry Nab, the interment would naturally be made at that\r\nchurch, though an unfortunate gap in the registers for the period\r\nprevents certainty on the point. But why was the event written down\r\nat Grasmere? It appears to have been inscribed by George Bennison,\r\nclerk and schoolmaster, who did not enter office till 1641. Had he\r\nthe intention (unfortunately unfulfilled) of recording local history\r\nin the register-book? Could we suppose the Ambleside Fair for October\r\n20th--an occasion of great resort only a few decades later--to have\r\nbeen in vogue before its charter was gained, the conjecture that the\r\ndrowned folk had been attending the fair might be entertained.[198]\r\nThere were other passage-boats on the lake besides the Great one.\r\nIn connection with the number drowned, it may be mentioned that\r\nferry-boats were formerly of great size. Miss Celia Fiennes, who,\r\nabout the year 1697, had occasion on her journey to cross the Mersey\r\nwith her horses from Cheshire to Liverpool--a passage which occupied\r\n1-1/2 hours--did it in a boat which, she says, would have held 100\r\npeople.[199]\r\n\r\n  [198] Mr. G. Brown has been helpful in this matter, which is\r\n  very fully discussed in Mr. H. S. Cowper's _Hawkshead_. See also\r\n  _Ambleside Town and Chapel_.\r\n\r\n  [199] _Memorials of Old Lancashire_, vol. i., p. 60.\r\n\r\nMiss Helen Sumner has been, since 1906, engaged in a transcript of\r\nthe first register-book. It is now complete, and it will be put into\r\nuse instead of the old illegible volume, of which it is an absolutely\r\naccurate copy, done in fine modern script.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Miss Armitt was under the impression when writing of the\r\n     Registers that the Second Register was missing, so consequently\r\n     made no extracts from it.--ED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Recess in the Porch for Holy Water Stoup.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENTMENTS, BRIEFS, AND CHARITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Presentment for 1702 may be given fully as a specimen of the\r\ndocument which the wardens were bound to furnish at the Visitation\r\nof the Bishop or his emissary. A few extracts may be added, for\r\nthe simplicity and shrewdness of some of the answers make them\r\nentertaining, as in the entire repudiation of an apparitor and his\r\ndues.\r\n\r\nDuring Dr. Fleming's rectorate, a difference arose between the\r\nofficials who controlled the finance department of the Visitation\r\nand the vestries of the parishes of Windermere and Grasmere.[200]\r\nIt was proposed by the latter to make one Presentment serve for the\r\nwhole parish, mother-church and chapels together; and the rector\r\nof Grasmere stated that it was only through a mis-conception that\r\nseparate Presentments had been made. This was a sound, economical\r\nplan for the parish, but it was firmly opposed (as was natural) by\r\nthe higher officials, who affirmed that separate Presentments were\r\nthe rule. The table of \"ancient and justifiable fees\" was given as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  [200] Browne MSS.\r\n\r\n                                                        £  s. d.\r\n  For appearance and presentment of every warden, four\r\n      old and four new                                  0  8  0\r\n  Book of Articles                                      0  1  0\r\n  Examination Fee and registration of every presentment 0  0  8\r\n  Citation Fees and exhibiting the transcript           0  1  0\r\n  Due to the King for Citation                          0  0  6\r\n  Apparitor's Fee                                       0  0  8\r\n\r\n  Also apparitors received at the Visitation a fee for carrying\r\n  out books sent by the King and Council--as Thanksgiving Books,\r\n  etc.; and for each of these he might claim a fee of 1s., which\r\n  raised the sum total to be paid at a Visitation occasionally to\r\n  14s. or 15s. No wonder our wardens disclaimed all knowledge of\r\n  the apparitor! For their consolation they were reminded that in\r\n  other Jurisdictions the wardens were called to Visitations twice\r\n  a year, which doubled the fees and expenses.\r\n\r\n  In 1691 the parish paid \"To the Chancellor at the Bishop's\r\n  Visitation for a Presentment\" 5s. 10d.

One or two answers\r\n     to queries, however, are naive. In 1712 \"we have no physitia's,\r\n     nor Sargions in or parish.\"\r\n\r\n     Concerning officers of Ecclesistiall Courts, we know not their\r\n     Officers; nor wh their Officers are; nor now they perform them,\r\n     well, or ill; nor wh their just Fees are, and can therefore give\r\n     no account of ym.\r\n\r\n     In 1717 \"Concerning Apparitors. We know not how Apparitors do\r\n     their office, nor can we present them, or any of tm, for any\r\n     undue Fees exacted by them, and we think we ought not to pr'sent\r\n     any man for faults wch we know not by him.\"\r\n\r\n     Between 1702 and 1732 only one woman is \"presented\" for\r\n     \"fornication\"; and only occasionally, in a later set of\r\n     Presentments, between 1768 and 1796 is the fault--which the\r\n     registers show to have been not infrequent--mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIEFS.\r\n\r\nPrinted briefs, that called upon the churches to succour the\r\nunfortunate by offerings in money, reached Grasmere, remote as it\r\nwas. Such of these sheets, as were found to be sufficiently intact,\r\nwere quite recently gathered together and bound as a volume. Within\r\nthe register-book the amount realised by some of these collections\r\nis set down. At Christmas, 1668, the offering made for the poor of\r\nLondon after the fire, reached the high figure of £17 6s. 3d., which\r\nshows how that great calamity affected the popular mind. Among other\r\nrecipients of the parochial bounty are found: \"Captives at allgeeres\"\r\n(Algiers), 3s. 1d., also \"A breife beyond ye seaes and for ye suply\r\nof printing The bible for one John de Krins..y,\" 7s. 3d. Very\r\nfrequently individuals or towns that had suffered loss from fire or\r\nother causes were relieved. Perhaps there was grumbling then, as now,\r\nat the many collections, and 8d. only was realised for the relief of\r\nHartlepool. The Squire, who generally gave one shilling for a brief,\r\nwas doubtless absent that day.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARITIES.\r\n\r\nThe care of the poor was of old a parochial matter. The regular\r\nsupply of money for this purpose came from the offertories at the\r\ngreat feasts of the church, and was distributed (at least after the\r\nReformation, if not before) by the wardens. There were other and\r\ncasual sources, such as the doles given at the funeral of a person of\r\ngentle birth. The scale of the dole differed according to the rank\r\nof the individual. In the seventeenth century four pence (the old\r\nsilver penny) was the usual sum, though at the funeral of William\r\nFleming, of Coniston (claimant to Rydal Manor), only 2d. was given.\r\nSquire John Fleming was buried quietly, on the evening of his death,\r\nlike many another recusant. There was no time, therefore, for that\r\nextraordinary and seemingly magnetic gathering of the poor, that\r\nsometimes occurred, even on a day's notice--for such news sped like a\r\ntelegraphic message.\r\n\r\nBut some indigent folk collected next morning, when £1 10s. was\r\ndistributed. This, at 4d. a piece, would represent 90 persons. The\r\nconcourse was far greater when Squire Daniel's wife was interred,\r\nwhen it numbered over 1,800 persons; the amount given reaching\r\n£30 10s. 4d., while the dole-givers spent at the inn 3s. 6d. The\r\ngathering at his little son's funeral, two years later (1677), was\r\nnaturally smaller. The entry in the account-book is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  June 1--Given to ye Poor (at 2d. apeice) at ye\r\n      Funerall (this day) of my son Tho. Fleming at\r\n      Gresmere-church (where he was buried near\r\n      unto my Fathers Grave on ye north side thereof\r\n      close to ye wall, and who dyed yesterday, being\r\n      Thursday, about 8 of ye clock in ye morning\r\n      at Rydal Hall) ye sum of                          04  03  08\r\n\r\n  It[em] paid to ye Minster for attending ye Corps all\r\n      ye way 5s., to ye Clark for ye same, and\r\n      makeing of ye Grave 2s., to ye Ringers 2s. 4d.,\r\n      in all                                            00  09  04\r\n\r\nThe first bequest on record to the poor of Grasmere is that of\r\nold Mrs. Agnes Fleming, the shrewd mistress of Rydal Hall. Her\r\nwill, dated 1630, directs that threescore and ten pounds shall be\r\ndevoted to the poor of Staveley and \"Gressmire,\" the interest to be\r\ndistributed every Good Friday. In this distribution George Dawson\r\n\"beinge blinde\" was to receive during his life-time a noble, which\r\nwas 6s. 8d. or half a mark. Accordingly, after her death, the bailiff\r\nentered in his accounts £1 13s. as \"paid the poor folke at Easter\r\n1632 for my old mis\"; the blind lad's noble was also set down. This\r\ncharity seems, however, to have been lost during the \"Troubles\" that\r\npresently overtook family and country. An effort to re-institute the\r\none at Staveley at least was made by Squire Daniel.\r\n\r\n  March 25, 1659--Spent with my Cosen Philipson at\r\n      Staveley when I went to Mr. Feilde to looke\r\n      yt ye Poor of Staveley bee not wronged in ye\r\n      distribution of ye £40 interest, left ym by\r\n      my great Grandmother Mrs. Agnes Fleming           00  00  06\r\n\r\nMention of an extraordinary gift appears in the same account-book.\r\nThe young Earl of Thanet had lately, as Lord Lieutenant of\r\nWestmorland, entered the county in great state, and with a lavish\r\nexpenditure of money. His generosity (which may have had a political\r\nbias) extended even to this remote quarter of the Barony. In those\r\ndays £10 was a large sum; and the coin (as a precise entry under\r\nFebruary, 1685, informs us) was conveyed to Kendal by a servant,\r\ndelivered to the mayor, who passed it on to the Rydal Squire. One\r\nhalf was for Windermere, the other for Grasmere; and one wonders how\r\nlarge was the gathering at the church for the dole.\r\n\r\n  Mar. 1, 8-4/5--Distributed this day at ye Parish\r\n      Church in Gresmere to ye Poor Householders\r\n      yt go to Church in ye said Parish; being ye\r\n      gift of Tho. Earl of Thanet, ye sum of           05  00  00\r\n\r\nOther charitable gifts to the poor are written on boards hanging in\r\nthe church, viz.:--\r\n\r\nEdward Partridge and others of Grasmere £50, the interest to be\r\ndistributed on St. Thomas's Day to such poor as do not receive\r\nparochial relief. (Undated.)\r\n\r\nWilliam and Eleanor Waters, in 1807, £200, the interest to be\r\ndistributed under the like restrictions on Lady Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUSHBEARING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, in an account of Grasmere, to pass over the\r\nRushbearing, a Church Festival that has come down from ancient times,\r\nand which, after a period of languishment, has revived once more into\r\na popular pageant.\r\n\r\nIt may be the remnant of some fair or wake held on St. Oswald's Eve\r\nand Day, and organized by the early church to supersede some Pagan\r\nFeast of the late summer. The close of July, or the early part of\r\nAugust, was a good time for merry-making in these parts; for then\r\nthe husbandman's chief harvests were gathered in--the wool from the\r\nsheep, and the hay from the meadows; while the little patches of oats\r\nwere hardly ready for the sickle. We hear of a great pageant and play\r\ndevised by Thomas Hoggart[201] being performed in the open air at\r\nTroutbeck village (1693) on \"St. James his Day,\" which was the 25th\r\nof July, equal to the 5th of August, new style.\r\n\r\n  [201] _Remnants of Rhyme_, by Thomas Hoggart, Kendal, 1853.\r\n\r\nThe Rushbearing at Grasmere was held in recent times on the Saturday\r\nnearest to July 20th; and a stranger, T. Q. M., found a celebration\r\ntaking place in 1827 on July 21st.[202] In fact, the Day of the\r\nchurch's dedicatory Saint, August 5th (which is equal to August 16th,\r\nnew style) seems not to have been associated recently in the minds of\r\nthe people with the Festival; though it was associated at St. Oswald,\r\nWarton, where the ceremony survived till the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. It is possible that the shift from old to new style, in\r\n1752, weakened the connection between Saint's Day and Festival in\r\nthe minds of the folk, leaving them content to await the summons of\r\nthe clerk, who reminded them, it is said, when it was time to cut the\r\nrushes. The old chapels of the parish likewise had their Rushbearing.\r\nThat of Langdale appears in the wardens' accounts for that township,\r\nwhere 2s. 6d. was generally put down for expenses attending it.\r\nThe item disappears, however, after 1752, for then the chapel was\r\nrebuilt, and was no doubt paved throughout with the fine slate of\r\nthe valley: the need for rushes there being over, more than 80 years\r\nearlier than was the case with the mother church. The Ambleside\r\nFestival has continued to the present day (though with a lapse of a\r\nfew years, according to Grasmere folk), and is regularly held near\r\nthe day of her Saint (Anne), July 26th, the hymn used being the same\r\nas at Grasmere.\r\n\r\n  [202] Hone's _Table Book_.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the Rushbearing had of old a real meaning,\r\nfor the sweet rushes were strewn over the floors of churches and\r\nhalls alike, both for warmth and cleanliness.[203] The covering\r\nwas particularly necessary in churches where the soil beneath the\r\nworshippers' feet was full of corpses. The great annual strewing\r\n(though we would fain believe that it was done oftener than once a\r\nyear) was naturally performed when rushes were full grown. It was\r\na boon service given to the church by the folk during a spell of\r\nleisure. Such service they were well accustomed to. The statesman not\r\nonly by custom immemorial, gave to his lord a day's labour at harvest\r\ntime, but he and his wife cheerfully turned into their neighbour's\r\nfield for the like. Sheep-clipping has survived as a boon service;\r\nand what a man in old days gave to his fellow, he did not grudge to\r\nhis church.\r\n\r\n  [203] Queen Elizabeth's Palace at Greenwich had its Presence\r\n  Chamber, in 1598, \"richly hung with tapestry and strewn with\r\n  rushes.\"\r\n\r\nFood and drink alone were the boon-workers' meed of old; and the\r\nfirst entry that concerns the Rushbearing in the wardens' accounts\r\nshows that the drink at least was looked for.\r\n\r\n  1680--\"For Ale bestowed on those who brought\r\n      Rushes and repaired the Church                 00  01  00\"\r\n\r\nIt appears from this entry that the boon service was not limited\r\nto rush-bearing in old times; but that general repair was done by\r\nwilling craftsmen. The item for ale continues \"on Rush-bearers and\r\nothers\"; in 1684 it rises to 2s., and to 5s. 6d. next year. The\r\namount was perhaps considered excessive by the more temperate of\r\nthe parishioners--a runlet could be had for 3s.--and from 1690 the\r\ncharge \"To Rushbearers\" became a fixed one of 2s. 6d. At this figure\r\nit stood for 150 years, though from 1774 the township of Grasmere\r\nadded on its own account a further 1s. for \"Getting of rushes for the\r\nchurch.\"\r\n\r\nThe parochial charge \"To Rushes for Church,\" 2s. 6d. appears for the\r\nlast time in 1841. With the paving of the floor, which took place in\r\n1840, the need for the fragrant covering was over, and matting was\r\nlaid down--probably only in the aisles--in 1844, at an expense of\r\n11s. 4d.\r\n\r\nUp to then rush-strewing had been necessary. Burials in the earthen\r\nfloor had continued up to 1823; and the forms, from the gradual\r\nsinking of the ground, had to be constantly lifted and re-set. Only\r\nin 1828 the townships had gone to considerable expense in re-seating\r\nand re-flagging their portions of the interior, and in the same year\r\na stray visitor to Grasmere expressed himself as shocked at the\r\nprimitive condition of the church. \"I found the very seat floors\r\nall unpaved, unboarded, and the bare ground only strewed with\r\nrushes.\"[204] In the previous year T. Q. M. had found the villagers\r\nseriously working at their annual task of strewing. It seems to have\r\nbeen done informally, under the superintendence of the clerk; and\r\nlater in the day--nine o'clock it is said--came the spectacle and the\r\nmerry-making. A procession was formed, when the wild flowers--which\r\nthe children had been busily engaged during the day in gathering and\r\nweaving into garlands--were carried to the church and laid there. An\r\nadjournment was then made to a hay-loft, where dancing was kept up\r\ntill midnight, and where no doubt more than the parochial ale was\r\ndrunk. Old James Dawson, the fiddler, boasted to the stranger that he\r\nhad for forty-six years performed on the occasion. He complained of\r\nthe outlandish tunes introduced by the \"Union Band chaps,\" who had\r\napparently superceded him in the honour of leading the procession.\r\nBut James may be said to lead the music in spirit yet, for a certain\r\nmarch, used for an unknown period and handed down by his son Jimmy\r\n(who succeeded him as village fiddler), is still played.\r\n\r\n  [204] Morrison Scatcherd, quoted in the Rushbearing pamphlet\r\n  compiled by Miss E. Grace Fletcher.\r\n\r\nClarke was present at the Festival at an earlier date,[205] and he\r\ngives a rather different account of it. His description, however, is\r\nof something he had seen in the past; and one is inclined to doubt\r\nthat the Rushbearing was ever held at the end of September. According\r\nto him, the rushes were actually borne in the procession, which was\r\nheaded by girls carrying nosegays, the chief of whom (called the\r\nQueen) had a large garland. When the work of strewing was done, and\r\nthe flowers laid in the church, the concourse was met at the church\r\ndoor by the fiddler, who played them to the ale-house, there to spend\r\nan evening of jollity.\r\n\r\n  [205] _Survey of the Lakes_, 1789.\r\n\r\nAn account of the ceremony at Warton, earlier still,[206] gives an\r\ninteresting variation of custom. Here the floral decorations were\r\nnot separate from the rushes, but covered the bundles as crowns. The\r\nsmartest of them, trimmed with fine ribbon and flowers, were carried\r\nin front by girls. The crowns were detached in the church, and\r\nafter the strewing of the rushes were left as ornaments. Artificial\r\ntrimmings were in use in Grasmere in 1828, for the stranger's eye\r\nhad been \"particularly attracted by the paper garlands which I found\r\ndeposited in the vestry; they were curiously and tastefully cut, and\r\nI was almost tempted to buy one of them.\" The sketch by Allom of\r\nthe Ambleside Festival in 1833 shows how elaborate and artificial\r\nthe bearings had become.[207] But taste and meaning could not have\r\nbeen altogether banished for certain sacred emblems and devices\r\nwere cherished; and Moses in the Bulrushes, and the Serpent in the\r\nWilderness--the latter wholly composed of rushes--which are still\r\ncarried as \"bearings\" at Grasmere, are said to have been handed down\r\nfrom a forgotten past. The same is claimed for the Ambleside Harp,\r\nthe strings of which are contrived from the pith of the rush--the\r\n\"sieve\" of the olden days of rush-lights.\r\n\r\n  [206] MS. account, given in Whitaker's _Richmondshire._\r\n\r\n  [207] _Westmorland and Cumberland, etc., Illustrated_, 1833.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that the joint payment by the townships for the boon\r\nservice ceased when the actual rush-strewing ceased. But the Festival\r\ncontinued, though it was clearly changing its character and becoming\r\nthe children's Feast of Flowers. This is shown by Grasmere's special\r\ncontribution to the occasion. The annual gift, after rising a little,\r\nis entered in 1819 as 3s. 9d., \"To Rushbearers' Gingerbread paid\r\nGeo: Walker.\" From that time Grasmere's expenditure for \"Rushbearers\r\nbread\" is a constant though varying item. In 1839 it dropped as low\r\nas 1s. 6d., which, supposing two-pennyworth to be the amount given to\r\neach child, would represent but nine bearers. From this low figure\r\nhowever it rose; and the languishing Festival was revived, if not\r\nsaved, by the munificence of Mr. Thomas Dawson, of Allan Bank, who\r\nbegan about this time to present each bearer with 6d.[208] The\r\ngingerbread item was often 6s.; in 1847 it was 9s. 10d.; in 1851\r\nit is set down as \"To Rushbearers 62,\" 10s. 4d. In 1856 13s. 6d.\r\nwas paid to A. Walker for \"Rushbearers Cake,\" and in the next two\r\nyears the climax was reached by the sums £1. 1s. 5d. and £1. 1s.\r\nThe long-continued item then abruptly ceases--seventeen years after\r\nthe provision made for ale by the whole parish ceased--swept away\r\nno doubt by the revolution in church-management and church-rates,\r\nand for thirteen years there is a gap. When, however, the ancient\r\nbut now resisted church-rate was dropped in 1871, and all expenses\r\nwere defrayed from the large and gladly-paid offertory, the church\r\nagain provided for the Festival. The expenses were now put down under\r\n\"Rushbearing,\" as Bells 6s., Wilson 8s., Cakes 19s.; amounting to £1\r\n13s., towards which the collection at the church service (for the\r\nfirst time established) furnished 16s. 8d. Next year there was a\r\nmarked increase: Band £2, Joiners 8s., Ringers 6s., Gingerbread £1.\r\n5s. 10d., and Baldry 4s. 1d.; total £4. 3s. 11d.; collection, £2.\r\n18s. 1d. The payment to joiners must have been for making the frames\r\nof the bearings, which have assumed many varied forms.\r\n\r\n  [208] The wardens' accounts, given below, practically agree with\r\n  the story as told in the _Rushbearing_ pamphlet, p. 24, where\r\n  the Festival of 1885 is described, but apparently the date 1834\r\n  should be 1839. \"Before leaving the church-yard, the children,\r\n  to the number of about 115, were each given a sixpenny piece, in\r\n  accordance with the custom that has prevailed for over the last\r\n  fifty years. The origin of this gift of sixpence will perhaps be\r\n  of interest to many. In 1834 there were only seven rushbearers,\r\n  and it seemed that this revered custom was on the decline. Mr.\r\n  Dawson, of London, and owner of Allan Bank, was present, and\r\n  he gave each of the rushbearers sixpence, which gift he has\r\n  continued yearly ever since. The next year the numbers of bearers\r\n  was increased to fifty, and year by year this figure has been\r\n  added to. It is said that Mr. Dawson does not intend to continue\r\n  his gift any longer, so that it appears the year 1885 will be\r\n  the last one in which the children will receive their brand new\r\n  sixpence, unless someone takes the matter in hand, or Mr. Dawson\r\n  reconsiders his decision.\"\r\n\r\nThe Festival has, since 1885, taken place on the Saturday next to\r\nSt. Oswald's Day. The procession, from which everything gaudy and\r\nirreverent has been eliminated, now makes a beautiful spectacle.\r\nChildren of all ages take part in it, even tiny toddlers, supported\r\nby parent or grandmother. The floral burdens are deposited in the\r\nchurch and the service held, when all disperse; and on the next\r\nMonday the children have their feast with games and prizes, paid for\r\nby the united contribution of the parishioners.\r\n\r\nThe Walker family, who for so long provided the gingerbread, are\r\nremembered to have had a little shop--the only one in the place--and\r\nit stood near the present one of Messrs. Gibson.[209] Presumably,\r\nDinah, the wife, baked the cake; and George, in the manner of the\r\ntime, pursued the additional trade of tailor. Mrs. Mary Dixon, of\r\nTown End, was the gingerbread maker for many years, but has recently\r\ngiven it up.\r\n\r\n  [209] A supply of Kendal wigs (a special cake still made in\r\n  Hawkshead) came to the shop once a week, as Miss Greenwood\r\n  remembers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Grasmere Churchwardens' Account General Charge, 1834: to\r\n  Rushes, 2/6.
